Ca²⁺-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid release: mechanisms that associate presynaptic and postsynaptic activities

Yuki Hashimotodani¹, Takako Ohno-Shosaku² and Masanobu Kano³

Endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) serve as retrograde messengers at synapses in various regions of the brain. They are released from postsynaptic neurons and cause transient and long-lasting reduction of neurotransmitter release through activation of presynaptic cannabinoid receptors. Endocannabinoid release is induced either by increased postsynaptic Ca²⁺ levels or by activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors. When these two stimuli coincide, endocannabinoid release is markedly enhanced, which is attributed to the Ca²⁺ dependency of phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ). This Ca²⁺-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid release is suggested to participate in various forms of synaptic plasticity, including short-term associative plasticity in the cerebellum and spike-timing-dependent long-term depression in the somatosensory cortex. In these forms of plasticity, PLCβ seems to function as a coincident detector of presynaptic and postsynaptic activities.

[2,3]. Recently, endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids) have been found to function as retrograde messengers and contribute to synaptic modulation and plasticity [4–6]. Endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde modulation is now known to function at various types of synapses throughout the brain [7,8]. Knowledge concerning how the endocannabinoid signal is generated and contributes to short-term or long-term synaptic plasticity has expanded rapidly over the past two years [7,8]. In this review, we highlight the significance of phospholipase C (PLC)β in generation of the endocannabinoid signal and we discuss its roles in synaptic plasticity and endocannabinoid release.

Mechanisms that underlie generation of endocannabinoid signals

Endocannabinoid release triggered by postsynaptic depolarization

In early 1990s, it was found that depolarization of a principal neuron transiently suppressed its inhibitory synaptic inputs in the cerebellum and hippocampus [2,3], and this phenomenon was termed depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI). Further studies have revealed that DSI is mediated by retrograde messengers, which were finally identified as endocannabinoids in 2001 [4,5]. Concurrently, the counterpart of DSI at excitatory synapses, termed depolarization-induced suppression of excitation (DSE), was also confirmed to be mediated by endocannabinoids in the cerebellum [6]. Since then, several studies have reported similar endocannabinoid-mediated DSI or DSE in various brain regions [7].

A current model of DSI and DSE is as follows (Figure 1, red and black arrows). Postsynaptic depolarization causes a large influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels [9] and triggers the biosynthesis of endocannabinoids. The endocannabinoids then diffuse out and activate presynaptic Gi/o-coupled type 1 cannabinoid (CB₁) receptors. It is postulated that cannabinoid receptor ligands incorporate into plasma membranes and interact with CB₁ receptors through fast lateral diffusion across the membrane lipid bilayer because of their lipophilic nature [10]. The activation of CB₁ receptors causes suppression of transmitter release in a reversible manner, through multiple mechanisms that include modifications of Ca²⁺ channels, K⁺ channels and release machinery [11–13]. Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release in the postsynaptic neuron might also be involved at some synapses [14]. The peak

Introduction

At chemical synapses in the central nervous system, the signal is transmitted from presynaptic to postsynaptic neurons. The efficacy of this anterograde transmission is modulated by several factors and undergoes plastic change, which is thought to be important for brain functions including learning and memory [1]. In certain forms of synaptic plasticity, it has been postulated that there are also retrograde messengers, which are released from postsynaptic neurons and act on presynaptic terminals

Retrograde endocannabinoid signaling. Strong postsynaptic depolarization causes influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (VGCCs); this leads to a large increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels (red arrows), which induces production of diacylglycerol (DG) through unknown pathways (question mark). Activation of Gq-coupled receptors stimulates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) to produce diacylglycerol from phosphatidylinositol (PI; blue arrows). When Gq-coupled receptor activation coincides with mild increase in Ca²⁺ levels induced by weak postsynaptic depolarization (green arrows), diacylglycerol is produced more effectively than without a Ca²⁺ increase because PLCβ is Ca²⁺ dependent. Another PLCβ product, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P₃ or IP₃) might facilitate the receptor–PLCβ signaling by releasing Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through IP₃ receptors (purple arrows). Diacylglycerol is then converted to 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) through activity of diacylglycerol lipase (DGL; black arrow). 2-AG is released and binds to presynaptic cannabinoid CB₁ receptors, probably through fast lateral diffusion across the membrane lipid bilayer; this causes suppression of neurotransmitter release. Degradation of 2-AG is mediated by postsynaptic activity of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and presynaptic activity of monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL; brown arrows). In this scheme, the synapse is generalized and not specified as either excitatory or inhibitory.

Ca²⁺ concentration required for DSI or DSE is in a micromolar range [15,16] but the requirement can be lowered by a sustained increased in Ca²⁺ levels [17]. 2-Arachidonoylethanolamine (2-AG), one of the two major endocannabinoids, is suggested to mediate DSI and DSE [18–21]. Biochemical studies indicate that 2-AG is produced from membrane lipids through two enzymatic reactions by PLC and diacylglycerol lipase (DGL), although some additional pathways are also available [22]. The involvement of DGL in DSI and DSE is supported by several studies [19–21] but not by some others [23–25]. There is no conclusive evidence that PLC is involved in DSI and DSE.

Endocannabinoid release triggered by Gq/11-coupled receptor activation

Endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde modulation driven by Gq/11-coupled receptors was first found in the cerebellum [26]. This study demonstrated that activation of metabotropic glutamate type 1 (mGlu₁) receptors in Purkinje cells induced endocannabinoid release and caused suppression of excitatory transmission from climbing fibers to Purkinje cells in cerebellar slices. Importantly, this modulation did not require increased Ca²⁺ concentrations, indicating that the underlying mechanism is distinct from DSI and DSE. Since then, many studies have reported similar endocannabinoid-mediated retrograde modulations driven by Gq/11-coupled receptors — which include group 1 mGlu receptors [27–31], M₁ and M₃ muscarinic receptors [32,33] and the orexin receptor [34] — in various brain regions. A current model for the receptor-driven endocannabinoid release is illustrated in Figure 1 (blue and black arrows) [7,8]. Activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors stimulates PLCβ and the enzymatic product diacylglycerol is then converted to 2-AG by

DGL. Anatomical studies have demonstrated that DGLα, one of the two isozymes of DGL, is localized on postsynaptic sites that face CB₁-expressing terminals in the cerebellum and hippocampus, suggesting that these endocannabinoid system-related molecules are finely organized at synapses [35*,36*].

### Combination of postsynaptic depolarization and receptor activation

As already described, endocannabinoid release is induced either by depolarization or by activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors through distinct processes. However, when these two stimuli are combined, the endocannabinoid release is markedly facilitated [27,28,32,37].

Two recent studies have used different experimental systems to show that PLCβ is the key molecule in detecting the coincidence of the two stimuli [16*,38**]. The study that used hippocampal neurons clearly demonstrated that muscarinic-receptor-driven endocannabinoid release required PLCβ1 and exhibited a sharp Ca²⁺ dependency within a physiological range. The muscarinic-receptor-driven PLC activation, which was monitored by diacylglycerol-sensitive transient-receptor potential (TRP)C6 channels, also depended on PLCβ1 and exhibited a similar Ca²⁺ dependency. These results strongly suggest that PLCβ1 detects the coincidence through its Ca²⁺ dependency and induces 2-AG synthesis in the hippocampus [38**]. The study that used cerebellar slices came to a similar conclusion [16*]. In this study, the mGlu₁-driven endocannabinoid release depended on intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, and enhancement of endocannabinoid release by the combination of increased Ca²⁺ concentration and mGlu₁ activation was abolished in Plcb4 knockout mice. This PLCβ4-dependent enhancement of endocannabinoid release was induced by a submicromolar increase in Ca²⁺ concentration, which was much lower than the level required for DSE [15,16*]. The endocannabinoid release induced by a small Ca²⁺ increase and simultaneous weak receptor activation has been termed Ca²⁺-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid release (Ca-RER) [16*].

A current model for Ca-RER is included in Figure 1 (green, blue and black arrows). When the activation of Gq/11-coupled receptors coincides with increased Ca²⁺ levels, PLCβ is effectively activated and yields diacylglycerol, which is then converted to 2-AG by DGL. It should be noted that the receptor–PLCβ signaling cascade might behave in a complicated manner owing to the Ca²⁺ dependency of PLCβ. Under physiological conditions, the receptor–Gq/11–PLCβ signaling increased Ca²⁺ levels through inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (Ins(1,4,5)P₃) receptors or receptor-operated Ca²⁺-permeable channels (TRPC channels or other Ca²⁺ entry channels). Therefore, the PLCβ signaling might be activated in a regenerative manner through the positive feedback loop between PLCβ and Ca²⁺ (Figure 1, purple arrows). It is also likely that the receptor–PLCβ signaling is influenced by preceding conditions that modulate the basal Ca²⁺ level or the filling state of Ca²⁺ stores.

#### Functional significance of Ca²⁺-assisted receptor-driven endocannabinoid release in synaptic plasticity

Recent studies have suggested that Ca-RER is crucial for induction of endocannabinoid-mediated short-term and long-term plasticity. In the cerebellum, brief stimulation (e.g. 50–100 Hz, ten pulses) of parallel fibers, but not of the granular layer [39,40], induced endocannabinoid release from Purkinje cells and suppressed release of glutamate from parallel fiber terminals [16*,41]. This type of synaptic suppression depended on both mGlu₁ receptor activation and increased postsynaptic Ca²⁺ and was abolished in *Plcb4* knockout mice [16*], indicating the contribution of Ca-RER. A similar type of suppression is induced by presynaptic firing alone in local interneurons of the cerebellum [42] and dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmental area [43]. An associative type of short-term plasticity that involves Ca-RER was also found in the cerebellum. Brenowitz and Regehr [44**] showed that coactivation of parallel fibers and climbing fibers markedly facilitated endocannabinoid-mediated suppression of parallel fiber synapses. When parallel fiber stimulation was combined with climbing fiber stimulation (100 Hz, five pulses to parallel fibers), two to five pulses were enough to induce endocannabinoid release. This associative short-term plasticity was shown to depend on both mGlu₁ receptor activation and increased postsynaptic Ca²⁺. Ca-RER can also have a role in integrating the inputs of different neurotransmitters. Cholinergic inputs enhanced the depolarization-induced endocannabinoid release and augmented the suppression of GABAergic inputs in the hippocampus [32,38**] and striatum [45]. Because postsynaptic depolarization is generally evoked by glutamatergic inputs, PLCβ could have a role in integrating glutamatergic and cholinergic inputs and modulating GABAergic inputs through the endocannabinoid signal in these neurons.

Several studies suggest the involvement of Ca-RER in long-term plasticity, which includes cerebellar long-term depression (LTD) [24] and cortical spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) [46**,47**]. Cerebellar LTD, which is induced by repeating the combination of parallel fiber and climbing fiber stimulation, depends on postsynaptic increased in Ca²⁺ levels and mGlu₁ receptor activation [48]. A recent study demonstrated that cerebellar LTD required 2-AG release and CB₁ receptor activation [24], suggesting that the dependency of LTD on Ca²⁺ and mGlu₁ receptors reflects, at least in part, the involvement of Ca-RER in 2-AG production. STDP is induced by presynaptic and postsynaptic firings that have a certain pre-to-post timing. At excitatory synapses in the sensory

cortex, repeated presynaptic firing that precedes postsynaptic firing by 0–20 ms generally induces timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tLTP), whereas pairing with the inverse timing induces timing-dependent LTD (tLTD).

In a classical model of STDP, postsynaptic NMDA receptors function as the sole coincidence detector for induction of both tLTP and tLTD [49,50]. However, a model for STDP in which there are two coincidence detectors [51] is supported by recent studies. Bender et al. [46**] investigated STDP at excitatory layer 4 synapses on layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex. They found that postsynaptic NMDA receptors were required for tLTP but not for tLTD, whereas mGlu₅ receptors, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, Ins(1,4,5)P₃ receptors and CB₁ receptors were required for tLTD. Nevian and Sakmann reported that tLTD at basal dendrites of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the somatosensory cortex involved a mGlu–PLC pathway and endocannabinoid signaling but did not require postsynaptic NMDA receptors [47**]. The authors proposed that mGlu receptors function as a postsynaptic switch that determines the direction of STDP. Interestingly, this tLTD is independent of postsynaptic NMDA receptors, but requires non-postsynaptic (probably presynaptic) NMDA receptor activation, as reported for tLTD in visual cortex [52]. A presumed mechanism of endocannabinoid release for inducing tLTD is as follows. Postsynaptic firing causes an increase in postsynaptic Ca²⁺ levels, which boosts the mGlu–PLCβ cascade that is driven by the subsequent presynaptic firing; the result is effective triggering of the retrograde endocannabinoid signal. In this model, PLCβ is the second coincidence detector.

### Mechanisms of terminating endocannabinoid signals

The magnitude and time-course of endocannabinoid signaling is determined by the balance between the generation and degradation of endocannabinoids. The major endocannabinoid 2-AG is hydrolyzed by monoacylglycerol lipase (MGL) [53], which is localized at axon terminals [54]. It was originally found, using the MGL inhibitor URB 754, that MGL is responsible for termination of hippocampal DSI [55]. However, later studies failed to confirm the effects of this compound on MGL activity and DSI [21,56,57], and it was recently shown that the previously reported effects of URB 754 are caused not by URB 754 itself but by contaminants [58]. Instead of URB 754, the contribution of MGL activity to terminating the endocannabinoid signal was confirmed by showing that generally used MGL inhibitors prolong DSI and DSE [21,59]. Interestingly, it was found that these MGL inhibitors suppressed the basal synaptic transmission in a CB₁-dependent manner [21], suggesting that 2-AG is constitutively released and degraded by presynaptic MGL even at basal conditions. The blockade of another endocannabinoid degradation enzyme, cyclooxygenase-2

(COX-2), also prolonged DSI [18]. In contrast to MGL, COX-2 was suggested to degrade 2-AG within postsynaptic neurons before it is released [18]. The termination mechanism of endocannabinoid signaling is shown in Figure 1 (brown arrows).

### Conclusions and future directions

After the first discovery of retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, a growing body of evidence has been presented that the endocannabinoid signal is widely used for induction of short-term and long-term synaptic plasticity throughout the brain. Although endocannabinoid release can be induced by multiple mechanisms, Ca-RER, which depends on both PLCβ and Ca²⁺, seems to be the most physiologically important. In this review, we have introduced several studies suggesting that Ca-RER is crucial for endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic plasticity, which is induced by repetitive firing of one synaptic input, associated activities of two distinct synaptic inputs, or combined presynaptic and postsynaptic firings that have a certain pre-to-post timing. In either case, PLCβ seems to detect the coincidence of increased Ca²⁺ levels and Gq/11-coupled receptor activation in the postsynaptic neuron and to generate the endocannabinoid signal, which then activates presynaptic CB₁ receptors. It is not yet clear how presynaptic CB₁ activation causes a long-lasting change in transmitter release. The downstream signaling cascades from CB₁ receptor activation to long-lasting modification of transmitter release should be determined in future studies.

Furthermore, the authors show convincingly by biochemical analysis that combination of weak mGlu₁ activation and mild depolarization in Purkinje cells effectively induces 2-AG production in a PLCβ4-dependent manner.

This study examines subcellular localization of DGLα in the cerebellum and hippocampus. Anatomical data indicate that in the cerebellum, DGLα is predominantly expressed in Purkinje cells and is concentrated at the base of spine neck and somatodendritic surface but not in the spine head. By contrast, in hippocampal pyramidal cells, DGLα is distributed in the spine head, the spine neck or both. By examining the anatomical relationship of DGLα distribution with other endocannabinoid signaling molecules, including mGlu₁, PLCβ4 and CB₁, the study shows that these elements are finely organized at excitatory synapses.

Similar to [35], this study also investigates the localization of DGLα in the hippocampus. *In situ* hybridization analysis shows that principal neurons express high levels of DGLα mRNA throughout the hippocampal formation.

This study demonstrates that endocannabinoid release driven by group I mGlu receptors or muscarinic receptors requires PLCβ1 and exhibits a sharp Ca²⁺ dependence within a physiological range in hippocampal neurons. The study shows that combination of muscarinic receptor activation and depolarization markedly facilitates endocannabinoid release in a PLCβ1-dependent manner, and that the timing of two stimuli is crucial for this enhancement. Using diacylglycerol-sensitive TRPC6 channels as a real-time monitor of PLC activity, the authors confirm that muscarinic-receptor-driven PLCβ1 activation exhibits the same Ca²⁺ dependency, and they conclude that PLCβ1 is a coincidence detector of increased Ca²⁺ levels and Gq/11-coupled receptor activation to induce endocannabinoid release.

In this study, the authors demonstrate that endocannabinoid release evoked by parallel fiber stimulation is greatly enhanced by coactivation of climbing fiber synapses in cerebellar Purkinje cells. The authors suggest that this short-term form of associative synaptic plasticity involves two mechanisms. First, parallel-fiber-induced mGlu₁ activation reduces the Ca²⁺ requirement of endocannabinoid release. Second, parallel fiber and climbing fiber coactivation induces supralinear dendritic Ca²⁺ transients.

This study supports the ‘two coincidence detector model’ for STDP. The study shows that in the somatosensory cortex spike-timing-dependent LTP requires postsynaptic NMDA receptors, whereas LTD requires mGlu₅ receptors, Ca²⁺ influx through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, Ins(1,4,5)P₃

receptors, retrograde endocannabinoid signaling, and non-postsynaptic (probably presynaptic) NMDA receptors.

Similar to [46**], this study also supports the two coincidence detector model for STDP. The authors demonstrate that spike-timing-dependent LTD requires increased postsynaptic Ca²⁺ levels, activation of mGlu receptors and PLC, and endocannabinoid signaling, but not postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Importantly, this study shows that the amplitude of the Ca²⁺ level increase in spines is not correlated to the direction of plasticity (LTP or LTD). The authors suggest that a mGlu-receptor-coupled signaling cascade is important for determination of the direction of plastic change.
