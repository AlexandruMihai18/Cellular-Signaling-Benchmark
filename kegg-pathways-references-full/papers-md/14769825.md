ABSTRACT Mitogens activate protein translation through phosphorylation of p7S6 kinase (p70<sup>S6K</sup>) and eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1) mediated by the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) or phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K). A recent report (*Science* 294, 1942, 2001) has implicated phospholipase D (PLD) in mTOR signaling. We studied the role of PLD in the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 induced by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) using fibroblasts deficient in PLD activity and also 1-butanol, which inhibits phosphatidic acid production by PLD. The reduction in PLD activity in both situations impaired the effect of LPA on mTOR signaling but did not inhibit the effect of PDGF. PDGF induced marked phosphorylation of Akt (a PI3K target) but this was not affected by PLD deficiency. LPA caused much less phosphorylation of Akt and this was dependent on PLD activity. Toxin B, which inactivates Rho GTPases, markedly impaired PLD1 activation and phosphorylation of Akt, p70<sup>S6K</sup>, and 4E-BP1 induced by LPA but had a minimal or no effect on the actions of PDGF. These results support the hypothesis that LPA activates protein translation through the action of PLD1-generated PA on mTOR and the PI3K/Akt pathway whereas PDGF acts through P13K/Akt independent of PLD1.

PLD is involved in cell proliferation signaling remain unclear.

The target of rapamycin (TOR) is known to play a central role in regulating cell growth and proliferation, and TOR activity is linked functionally to various cellular phenomena, including the G0/G1-S transition in the cell cycle, translation, transcription, and actin reorganization. The physiological roles of TOR were initially identified in yeast; the mammalian counterpart (mTOR, also known as FRAP) plays a similar role, with some exceptions. A well-known common function of mTOR and yeast TOR is the regulation of translational initiation. Upon receiving nutritional signals, mTOR increases the phosphorylation of translation regulators p70S6 kinase 1 (p70<sup>S6K</sup>) and eIF4E binding protein 1 (4E-BP1, also called PHAS-I), and this results in initiation of protein translation (3, 4). Phosphorylation of these translation regulators is also induced by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-mediated signaling upon the stimulation of cells by mitogens such as growth factors (5). Although several reports show that insulin and mitogens in serum can induce phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 by a mTOR-dependent mechanism(s) (6, 7), the pathway(s) upstream of mTOR is now well understood. A recent report has suggested a novel mechanism for regulating mTOR activity by showing that serum can activate mTOR in a PA-dependent manner (8). The workers suggested an involvement of PLD in signaling from serum to mTOR by showing the inhibition of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation by 1-butanol, which blocks PA production by PLD.

THE PHOSPHATIDYLCHOLINE (PC) hydrolyzing enzyme phospholipase D (PLD) has been implicated in various cellular responses to growth factors (1). PLD produces phosphatidic acid (PA) and choline upon extracellular stimulation by agents such as lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), epidermal growth factor, and phorbol ester. Protein kinase C (PKC) and small G-proteins of the ARF and Rho family have been identified as signaling molecules that mediate agonist stimulation of PLD (1). Although PLD activation has been studied extensively, the physiological roles of the enzyme are not fully understood. Involvement of PLD in neoplastic transformation has been reported (2), but the detailed mechanics of how

In the present study, we examined mTOR signaling in wild-type Rat-2 fibroblasts and Rat-2 clones in which PLD activity is reduced (9) in order to correlate PLD function with translational regulation. We have further explored the role of PLD by examining the effects of 1-butanol. We have found differential effects of LPA and PDGF on PLD/mTOR signaling and have obtained evidence that LPA can activate PI3K by a PLD-dependent pathway.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Materials

HBSS (Hank's balanced salt solution), DMEM (Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium), FBS (fetal bovine serum), and PDGF were purchased from Invitrogen (San Diego, CA, USA) and LPA was from Avanti Polar Lipids (Birmingham, AL, USA). Phospho-amino acid-specific antibodies against pThr374E-BP1, pThr389-p70<sup>S6K1</sup>, pThr421/pSer424-p70<sup>S6K1</sup>, pSer2448mTOR, and pSer473-Akt and antibodies against p70<sup>S6K1</sup> and Akt were obtained from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, MA, USA). Anti-4E-BP1 (PHAS-I) antibody was purchased from Zymed Laboratories (San Francisco, CA, USA) and anti-mTOR antibody was from BD Biosciences (San Jose, CA, USA). LY 294002 was from Cell Signaling Technology and 1-butanol, 2-butanol, t-butanol (tertiary-butanol, 2-methyl-2-propanol), 4β-phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate (PMA), and bovine serum albumin were from Sigma (St. Louis, MO, USA). BCA protein assay kit was purchased from Pierce (Rockford, IL, USA) and *C. difficile* toxin B was from Calbiochem (San Diego, CA, USA).

Cell culture

Rat-2 embryonic fibroblasts were purchased from the American Type Culture Collection (Gaithersburg, MD, USA) and cultured in DMEM containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of air-CO₂ (19:1). Rat-2 clones with reduced PLD activity; Rat2V25 and Rat2V29 were maintained in DMEM containing 0.5 mg/mL G418. For serum starvation, cells were incubated in DMEM for 24 h without G418 and incubated for another hour after replacement with fresh DMEM.

Cell growth measurement

Rat-2 and Rat2V25 cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 2 × 10⁴ cells/mL. Cells were detached by trypsin-EDTA and counted using a hemocytometer 12 h after the plating and every 24 h thereafter. The average cell number at each time point was obtained from five different countings.

Western blot

Serum-starved or nonstarved Rat-2 cells and their clones were incubated for 1 h in DMEM before stimulation with FBS, LPA, or PDGF. Cells were washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) twice, then lysed in SDS sample buffer without 1,4-dithiothreitol. Harvested cell lysates were boiled and the protein concentration was measured using the bicinchoninic acid method. Up to 10 μg of cell lysate was loaded on the SDS-polyacrylamide gels and analyzed by Western blot. A 14% Tris-glycine gel or a 4–20% gradient gel was used for measuring the band shift of 4E-BP1 protein; an 8% gel was used for the band shift of p70<sup>S6K1</sup>. mTOR phosphorylation was measured by using 6% gels; all other blots were obtained by 4–20% gradient gels.

Measurement of phospholipase D activity

Rat-2 cells or COS-7 cells transiently transfected with pcDNA4C (vector) or Xpress-tagged rPLD1 or rPLD2 cDNA (10) were starved in DMEM for 24 h in the presence of 1 μCi/mL of [9,10-³H] myristic acid. Cells were washed with DMEM three times and incubated in fresh DMEM for 1 h in the presence or absence of toxin B (11). After a pretreatment of 0.3% 1-butanol for 5 min, cells were stimulated with LPA, PDGF, or PMA and the formation of [³H]phosphatidyl butanol was measured as described previously (9).

RESULTS

Reduction of PLD activity reduces the growth rate of Rat-2 cells

We have reported that stable overexpression of catalytically inactive PLD1 in Rat-2 fibroblasts reduced the endogenous PLD activity and caused defects in actin cytoskeleton rearrangement (9). We examined whether the clones with reduced PLD activity (Rat2V16, Rat2V25, and Rat2V29) had altered growth rates compared with wild-type Rat-2 cells. Figure 1 shows the growth rates of wild-type Rat-2 cells and a representative clone with reduced PLD (Rat2V25). The growth rate of Rat2V25 cells in the presence of 5% FBS was much reduced and closer to the rate of wild-type cells under low-serum (0.5% FBS) conditions. Rat2V25 cells grew even more slowly during culture in the low-serum environment. Similar results were found with the other clones (not shown). These results indicate a role for PLD activity in the regulation of cell growth.

Phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 is reduced in Rat-2 mutant clones

In view of a recent report suggesting that phosphatidic acid (PA) produced by PLD plays an essential role in serum-stimulated translational activation through effects on the mTOR pathway (8), we monitored the phosphorylation of two downstream effectors of mTOR (p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1) in response to stimulation by low (0.5%) and high (5%) concentrations of serum in the PLD-deficient clones. As shown in Fig. 2A, phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> on Thr389 and of 4E-BP1 on Thr37 was reduced in Rat2V25 and Rat2V29 cells compared with wild-type Rat-2 cells.

Since PLD produces phosphatidyl butanol instead of PA in the presence of 1-butanol, this alcohol can be used as an inhibitor of PA production by PLD. Figure 2B shows the protein band shift of 4E-BP1 due to phosphorylation by FBS. This shift was inhibited by pretreatment with 1-butanol but not by 2-butanol (0.5%), supporting the hypothesis that serum-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 requires PLD activity in Rat-2 fibroblasts. With increasing concentrations of 1-butanol (0.75 and 1.0%), there was a further reduction in phosphorylation, as shown by the appearance of lower bands (Fig. 2B).

### Differential effects of LPA and PDGF on mTOR signaling

Serum stimulation is the mixed effect of various mitogens. To determine whether mitogens that acted through G-protein-coupled receptors and those that interacted with receptors with tyrosine kinase activity induced phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 in a PLD-dependent manner, we compared the effects of LPA and PDGF. As shown in Fig. 3A, LPA increased the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1, as shown by the band shift, and phosphorylation of this protein on Thr37. PDGF also induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 (Fig. 3A). However, the phosphorylation induced by LPA was inhibited by 1-butanol whereas that caused by PDGF was not. We obtained similar results when we examined phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> by LPA and PDGF (Fig. 3B). However, the inhibitory effect of 1-butanol on the band shift of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and on the phosphorylation of Thr389 and Thr421/Ser424 of p70<sup>S6K</sup> induced by LPA was more striking. PDGF-induced phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> was not reproducibly inhibited by 1-butanol. The figure shows that 2-butanol also inhibited the LPA effect, though to a lesser extent than 1-butanol. In other experiments in which tertiary butanol was used as a control, the inhibition was much less (data not shown). Rapamycin blocked the effects of both LPA and PDGF, implying the involvement of mTOR (data not shown).

We examined the phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and p70<sup>S6K</sup> by LPA and PDGF in Rat-2 cells and Rat-2 mutant clones. The phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> at Thr389 was strongly increased by 0.1 and 10 μM LPA in the wild-type cells (Fig. 4A). However, the phosphorylation increase was much less in the mutant cells. Phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 at Thr37 in response to LPA was decreased in the mutant cells relative to wild-type.

of P13K (Fig. 5A).⁴ The phosphorylation of mTOR induced by LPA was not inhibited by 1-butanol pretreatment (Fig. 5A). Furthermore, there was no difference in mTOR phosphorylation when wild-type Rat-2 cells were compared with Rat-2 mutant cells (Fig. 5B). On the other hand, phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 was reduced in the same lysates from the mutant cells (Fig. 5B), in agreement with Fig. 4A. These findings agree with another report showing that mTOR phosphorylation is not essential for the downstream phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 (14). The data suggest that LPA stimulation induces mTOR phosphorylation separately from the phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1, which is dependent on PLD.

### Differential effect of PI3K on mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1 phosphorylation

Since it has been suggested that phosphorylation of mTOR Ser 2448 requires signaling through PI3K/Akt (13, 14), we tested whether pretreatment with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, could block mTOR phosphorylation. Figure 6 shows that LY294002 had little or

**Figure 3. Differential effects of LPA and PDGF on 4E-BP1 and p70S6K.** Cells were starved for 24 h and pretreated with 0.75% 1-butanol (1B) or 2-butanol (2B) for 30 min. Cells were harvested before and after stimulation with 10 μM LPA for 5 min or with 25 ng/mL PDGF for 15 min. A) Changes in phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 were analyzed by Western blot using anti-4E-BP1 (upper panel) and anti-pThr37-4E-BP1 antibody (lower panel). B) Phosphorylation of p70S6K was analyzed by using pThr389-p70S6K (upper panel) or pThr421/Ser424-p70S6K antibody (middle panel). P70S6K was quantitated by Western blot using anti-p70S6K antibody (bottom panel).

In contrast to the situation with LPA, PDGF-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 was not reproducibly altered in the mutant clones (Fig. 4B). These results supported the results of Fig. 3 by showing that the LPA-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K and 4E-BP1 was PLD dependent whereas the effect of PDGF was not. These results agree with a report showing that LPA-induced phosphorylation of p70S6K in NIH 3T3 cells is susceptible to 1-butanol inhibition (12).

### Phosphorylation of mTOR is independent of PLD

p70S6K and 4E-BP1 are phosphorylated via pathways involving either mTOR or P13K signaling (4). Since some reports have suggested that mTOR can be phosphorylated by Akt/PKB, which is activated by P13K (13, 14), we examined the phosphorylation of mTOR at Ser 2448 to see whether LPA and PDGF regulated mTOR phosphorylation. LPA induced phosphorylation of mTOR, but PDGF had negligible effects on this phosphorylation, although it is a well-known activator

**Figure 4. Differential effect of LPA and PDGF for 4E-BP1 and p70S6K in wild-type and mutant Rat-2 cells.** Cells (wt, wild-type Rat-2; 25, Rat2V25; 29, Rat2V29) were starved for 24 h and stimulated with LPA for 5 min (A) or with PDGF for 15 min (B) at the concentrations indicated. Phosphorylation changes were examined as described in Fig. 3.

with mTOR phosphorylation, LY294002 caused large decreases in the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 induced by LPA and PDGF (Fig. 6).

LPA-induced phosphorylation of Akt requires PLD activity

Although the foregoing results showed that PLD could be involved in LPA signaling for the initiation of translation, the involvement of PI3K was indicated by the finding that LY294002 suppressed the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 induced by LPA (Fig. 6). We therefore examined whether PLD played a role in the effect of LPA on PI3K activity. As shown in Fig. 7A, LPA elevated Akt phosphorylation, although the effect was much smaller than that of PDGF. The increase in Akt phosphorylation induced by LPA was inhibited by

Figure 5. PLD-independent phosphorylation of mTOR. A) Rat-2 cells were starved for 24 h and harvested after stimulation with 10 μM LPA for 5 min or 25 ng/mL PDGF for 15 min. Cells were pretreated with 0.75% 1-butanol (1B) or 2-butanol (2B) for 30 min before stimulation. The amount and phosphorylation of mTOR were analyzed by Western blot using antibodies against mTOR and pSer2448-mTOR. B) Wild-type (wt) and mutant Rat-2 cells (25 and 29) were starved for 24 h and stimulated with 10 μM LPA for 5 min. The phosphorylation of mTOR and 4E-BP1 was monitored as described above and in Fig. 3.

no effect on the phosphorylation of mTOR by LPA, in contrast to findings with insulin as a stimulus (13, 14). Another PI3K inhibitor, wortmannin, was also without effect on mTOR phosphorylation induced by both agonists (data not shown). In contrast to the findings

Serum-starved Rat-2 cells were incubated for 1 h in DMEM in the absence and presence of 10 μM LY294002 (LY), then stimulated with 10 μM LPA for 10 min or 25 ng/mL PDGF for 15 min. The phosphorylation of mTOR, p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 was monitored by Western blot using the anti-phospho-amino acid specific antibodies described in Figure 3.

REGULATION OF MTOR ACTIVITY BY PHOSPHOLIPASE D

pretreatment with 1-butanol, but not t-butanol. In contrast, no inhibitory effect of 1-butanol was observed on PDGF-induced phosphorylation. We also compared LPA-induced Akt phosphorylation in wild-type and mutant Rat-2 cells (Fig. 7B). The phosphorylation of Akt induced by LPA was clearly reduced in the Rat2V25 and Rat2V29 cells. In contrast, the effect of PDGF on the phosphorylation was not affected (Fig. 7C). The results of Figs. 6 and 7 show that the phosphorylation of Akt by LPA is PLD dependent but the effect of PDGF is not. The data also suggest that LPA signaling to p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 can be transmitted by PI3K.

### Differential effects of toxin B on LPA- and PDGF-induced phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup>, 4E-BP1, and Akt

Differential involvement of PLD in the effects of LPA and PDGF signaling to mTOR raised the possibility that the effect of PDGF on PLD activity was absent or minimal relative to LPA in Rat 2 cells. However, as shown in Fig. 8A, PDGF caused a marked stimulation of PLD. Since PLD can be activated by multiple pathways involving protein kinase C and small G-proteins (1), we tested the effects of *C. difficile* toxin B, which inactivates small G-proteins of the Rho family (11). The C3 exoenzyme of *C. botulinum* was tested, but this decreased cell viability to the extent that the results were not reliable. As shown in Fig. 8A, toxin B significantly impaired the activation of PLD by LPA but had less effect on the activation induced by PDGF. It also inhibited the phosphorylations of p70<sup>S6K</sup>, 4E-BP1, and Akt induced by LPA, but had no effect on the actions of PDGF. The toxin produced some reduction in the level of RhoA (Fig. 8B), but its major action was presumed to be the inactivation of Rho family proteins through glycosylation.

### Differential effects of toxin B on PLD1 and PLD2

To see whether the difference between toxin B effects on LPA- and PDGF-induced PLD activation could be due to the involvement of different PLD isoforms, we expressed PLD1 and PLD2 in COS-7 cells and tested the effects of the toxin. Figure 9 shows that expression of both PLD isoforms enhanced PLD activity. However, PLD2 induced higher PLD activity than PLD1 because of its greater expression (data not shown). Toxin B inhibited PLD activity under LPA- and PMA-stimulated conditions in the PLD1-expressing cells, whereas a small enhancement was observed with the PLD2 cells. Smaller effects of the toxin were observed on PLD activity of the untransfected cells. These data suggest that Rho proteins are involved in the activation of PLD1 but not PLD2.

### DISCUSSION

The importance of PLD activity in cell proliferation and differentiation is suggested by the fact that this ubiqui-

tously expressed enzyme is activated by various mitogens and differentiation signals (1). However, the mechanisms by which PLD is involved in growth and differentiation signaling are not clear. The reduction in growth rate caused by decreased PLD activity (Fig. 1) supports the requirement of PLD activity for proliferation signal(s), but we could not detect any significant change in the progression from the S to G2/M phase when we monitored cell cycle progress of wild-type and mutant Rat-2 cells after release from arrest at early S phase (data not shown). The idea that PLD may be involved in processes involved in the G1/S transition is suggested by previous (8) and present evidence that PLD is involved in mTOR signaling, since down-regulation of mTOR and 4E-BP1 signaling causes G1 arrest (15, 16).

LPA and PDGF are well-known activators of PLD in

discussed later, PI3K/Akt seems to be the major pathway involved.

The question then arises as to the nature of the LPA pathway. One possibility is that it involves activation of PLD. This would, of course, be consistent with the effects of inhibition of PLD signaling by 1-butanol and of the reduction of PLD1 activity in Rat2V25 and Rat2V29 cells observed in Figs. 2–4. As illustrated in Fig. 10, PLD has been reported to activate mTOR through the generation of PA (8) and a binding site for PA on mTOR has been identified. This is located where the rapamycin-FKBP12 complex binds (8), and PA may compete with rapamycin for binding to this site. The results with toxin B indicate the involvement of Rho family proteins in LPA activation of PLD (Fig. 8) and indicate that PLD1, not PLD2, is the PLD isozyme involved. This view is supported by studies demonstrating that PLD1 can be activated by constitutively active Rho in vivo whereas PLD2 is inhibited (10).

The major pathway from PDGF to p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 is probably via PI3K (Fig. 10). The activation of PI3K by PDGF and other growth factors through their receptor kinase activity is well established (18, 19); the pathway is supported in the present study by the demonstration that the phosphorylation of Akt, p70<sup>S6K</sup>, and 4E-BP1 by PDGF is greatly inhibited by LY 294002 (Fig. 6). However, the mechanisms by which PI3K activation leads to the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 apparently do not involve direct effects of Akt, but other protein kinases (4, 20). The question of whether mTOR is directly regulated by PI3K/Akt signaling in vivo remains open. The tuberous sclerosis complex has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on mTOR that is reversed by phosphorylation by PI3K/Akt (21–23). It has also been reported that the effect of the tuberous

Rat-2 fibroblasts but showed differential effects on mTOR signaling. As shown in Figs. 3 and 4, LPA-induced phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 is PLD dependent whereas the effect of PDGF is not. A similar difference in the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> was observed. It is interesting to consider why LPA and PDGF show differential PLD dependency. An obvious possibility is that their signaling pathways to p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 are different. This is shown by the effects of toxin B, which impaired the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup>, 4E-BP1, and Akt in response to LPA, but not to PDGF (Fig. 8). These data suggest that LPA signaling to mTOR involves Rho family proteins whereas that of PDGF does not. Activation of RhoA by LPA has been demonstrated in several cell lines whereas Rac appears to be the major Rho family member targeted by PDGF (17). However, the lack of toxin B effects on PDGF-induced phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> or 4E-BP1 indicates that Rac is not a major factor in PDGF signaling to these proteins; as

sclerosis complex on p70<sup>S6K</sup> is independent of mTOR (24).

Figure 8 shows that LY 294002 inhibited LPA-mediated phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1. Interpretation of these results is complicated by the fact that PI3K inhibitors can act not only on PI3K, but on downstream signaling involving mTOR (7, 25, 26). Nevertheless, as shown in Fig. 7A, the effect of LPA on the phosphorylation of Akt is much less than that of PDGF, whereas the effects of the two agonists on the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 are very similar (Fig. 3). This suggests that the contribution of the PI3K/Akt pathway to phosphorylation of these proteins by LPA is minor and that the contrary is true for PDGF. Thus, the PLD-dependent pathway seems to be important for LPA and the PI3K-dependent pathway appears to be important for PDGF (Fig. 10).

Another issue is the observation that inhibition of PLD activity decreases the phosphorylation of Akt induced by LPA, but not by PDGF (Fig. 7). Although both agonists can induce phosphorylation of Akt, the effect of LPA is much weaker than PDGF, as noted above. The pathways to Akt from LPA and PDGF are very different; our findings (Fig. 7) and the literature (27, 28) indicate they are differentially regulated by PLD. The conventional view is that the PDGF receptor recruits the p110 catalytic subunit of Class I<sub>A</sub> PI3Ks to the plasma membrane via the p85 adaptor subunit (18, 19). This generates PIP<sub>3</sub> from PIP<sub>2</sub>, which causes translocation of Akt to the membrane where it is phosphorylated and activated by 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (18, 19). Agonists such as LPA, which act through G-protein-coupled receptors, use a different mechanism to activate Akt. This involves activation of the G<sub>i/o</sub> family of G-proteins to generate βγ subunits that activate PI3K by two mechanisms, namely, interaction with the p101 regulatory subunit to activate the p100γ catalytic subunit of Class I<sub>B</sub> PI3K (29) or interaction with the p110β catalytic subunit (30).

The effects of toxin B on the stimulation of phosphorylation of Akt, p70<sup>S6K</sup>, and 4E-BP1 by LPA are attributable to the reduction of PLD1 activation induced by the toxin, but other mechanisms are possible. Rho family proteins Cdc42 and Rac1, but not RhoA, have been shown to activate p70<sup>S6K</sup> (31), but if this were the explanation, toxin B would be expected to affect PDGF, which activates Rac, but not LPA, which activates Rho (17, 32). Protein kinase C can be activated by LPA and PDGF and, in turn, can activate PLD1 (1). However, this pathway seems to play a minor role in the phosphorylation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 since phorbol ester has only a weak effect on this phosphorylation (data not shown) (Fig. 10).

Our finding that the signaling pathways from LPA and PDGF to Akt are differentially regulated by PLD is supported by recent reports (27, 28) that PLD is involved in the activation of PI3K and Akt by sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), but not by insulin-like growth factor I. These agents have similar signaling mechanisms to LPA and PDGF, respectively. These

findings and those of the present study suggest that the PLD acts at or upstream of PI3K in LPA signaling. The precise site of PLD action is currently under study, but it would appear to involve Class I<sub>B</sub> PI3Ks and not Class I<sub>A</sub> PI3Ks because of the differential involvement of these kinases in LPA and PDGF signaling.

The present findings indicate that LPA can phosphorylate mTOR on Ser 2448. Although PDGF does not induce significant phosphorylation of this residue in the serum-starved cells used in the present study (Fig. 5), it does so in nonstarved cells in which the basal phosphorylation is reduced (data not shown). The reasons for this difference are unknown and were not explored. The phosphorylation of mTOR Ser 2448 induced by LPA was not influenced by changes in PLD activity (Fig. 5) and its role in the activation of p70<sup>S6K</sup> and 4E-BP1 is unclear (20). Although there is evidence that PI3K and Akt are involved in the phosphorylation of mTOR in vitro and in cells stimulated by insulin (7, 13, 14), the failure of LY 294002 to alter the phosphorylation of mTOR induced by LPA or PDGF (Fig. 8) indicates that Akt does not play a role in this phosphorylation in our fibroblast cell line.

In summary, our results using toxin B, l-butanol, and cell lines deficient in PLD activity have identified Rho and PLD1 as factors in signaling to mTOR by LPA, but not PDGF (Fig. 10). The data are consistent with PI3K and mTOR as sites of PA action and illustrate the diverse cellular actions of PLD.
