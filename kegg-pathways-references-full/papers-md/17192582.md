ABSTRACT: During stress, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and the sympathoadrenal system leads to increased secretion of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, respectively, in order to maintain homeostasis. Recent evidence suggests that stress hormones, acting on antigen-presenting immune cells, may influence the differentiation of bipotential T helper (Th) cells away from Th1 and toward a Th2 phenotype. This results in suppression of cellular immunity and potentiation of humoral immunity. Thyroid autoimmunity is clinically expressed as Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and its variants (sporadic or postpartum thyroiditis) or as Grave’s disease (GD). The different phenotypic expression of thyroid autoimmunity is largely dependent on the balance of Th1 versus Th2 immune response. A predominantly Th1-mediated immune activity may promote apoptotic pathways on thyroid follicular cells leading to thyroid cell destruction and HT. Conversely, predominance of Th2-mediated immune response may induce antigen-specific B lymphocytes to produce anti-TSH receptor (TSHr) antibodies causing GD. The weight of evidence from epidemiological and case–control studies supports an association between stress and GD. On the other hand, there is little information available on the effect of stress on HT, but there is evidence for an increase in postpartum thyroiditis, following the cellular immune suppressive effect of pregnancy. Whether stress has a causative effect on GD remains elusive. Circumstantial evidence supports the hypothesis that stress may influence the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity in susceptible individuals favoring the development of GD by shifting the Th1–Th2 balance away for Th1 and toward Th2. Conversely, recovery from stress or the immune suppressive effect of pregnancy may induce a Th2 to Th1 “return shift” leading to autoimmune (sporadic) or postpartum thyroiditis, respectively.

TSATSOULIS: STRESS AND THYROID AUTOIMMUNITY 383

# INTRODUCTION

Stress has a significant effect on the immune system through neuroendocrine pathways. During stress, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, together with the sympathoadrenal system, is activated, resulting in systemic elevations in glucocorticoids and catecholamines, respectively. Both systems act in concert to maintain the internal milieu or homeostasis.¹ It has long been thought that stress hormones, and in particular glucocorticoids, exert a general immune suppressive effect. However, it is becoming clear that stress, through its effector pathways, has a differential effect on immune response, suppressing cellular and potentiating humoral immunity.²,³

Thyroid autoimmunity may be clinically expressed as chronic autoimmune or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and its variants (postpartum/sporadic thyroiditis) or as Graves’ disease (GD) and atrophic thyroiditis. Recent evidence suggests that the phenotypic expression of thyroid autoimmunity toward one or the other clinical entity is largely dependent on the pattern of immune response that predominates at a given time.⁴,⁵ The aim of this article is to provide evidence from experimental and clinical research in support of the hypothesis that stress may influence the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity.

## TH1–TH2 BALANCE AND IMMUNE RESPONSE

The type of immune response is regulated by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), including dendritic cells (DCs), macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells, which are components of innate immunity. These cells present (auto) antigens in conjunction with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and costimulatory signals to T helper (Th) cells, which express CD4⁺ surface antigens. The CD4⁺ Th cells are further subdivided into two subtypes, Th1 and Th2 cells, which are components of adaptive immunity. Th1 cells primarily secrete type 1 cytokines including interleukin-2 (IL-2), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) which activate cellular immunity leading to tissue damage. On the other hand, Th2 cells secrete type 2 cytokines, primarily interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, and IL-10 and provide help to antigen-specific B lymphocytes to produce antibodies involved in humoral immunity.⁶,⁷ Precursor CD4⁺ Th cells are thus bipotential and their differentiation toward Th1 or Th2 subtypes is dependent on the kind of signals they receive from APCs during antigen presentation. Thus, IL-12 produced by activated macrophages or DCs acting in concert with NK cell-derived IFN-γ on naïve CD4⁺ Th cells, induce Th1, whereas IL-4 and IL-10 promote Th2 differentiation. Furthermore, Th1 and Th2 effector arms of immune response are mutually inhibitory. Type 1 cytokines inhibit Th2, and type 2 cytokines inhibit Th1 response.⁸,⁹

STRESS HORMONES AND TH1–TH2 BALANCE

### Effect of Glucocorticoids and Catecholamines

Glucocorticoids, at levels achieved during stress, suppress cellular and potentiate humoral immunity. Glucocorticoids, acting through their cytoplasmic/nuclear receptors on APCs, suppress the production of IL-12, the main inducer of Th1 responses and downregulate the expression of IL-12 receptors on T and NK cells. Glucocorticoids also appear to upregulate the production of IL-4 and IL-10 by Th2 cells. This could be the result of a direct effect of glucocorticoids on T cells and/or the result of blocking the restraining effect of IL-12 and IFN-γ on Th2 cells. ${}^{10-13}$

In a similar manner, the two major catecholamines, epinephrine and norepinephrine, acting on APCs through β2-adrenergic receptors (ARs) suppress the production of IL-12, thus inhibiting the differentiation of Th1 cells while promoting Th2 cell differentiation. ${}^{10}$ In addition, catecholamines appear to inhibit the production of TNF-α and, at the same time, to potentiate the production of IL-10 by APCs. ${}^{14,15}$ Furthermore β2-ARs are expressed only on Th1 cells and not on Th2 cells, and this may provide an additional explanation for the differential effect of catecholamines on Th1–Th2 balance. Thus, β2-AR agonists inhibit IFN-γ production by Th1 cells, but do not affect IL-4 production by Th2 cells. ${}^{16}$ In conclusion, both glucocorticoids and catecholamines by downregulating type 1 and upregulating type 2 cytokine secretion may cause selective suppression of cellular immunity and a shift toward Th2-mediated humoral immunity.

### Local CRH–Mast Cell–Histamine Axis

Apart from the central hypothalamic corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) that influences the type of immune response indirectly, through activation of the HPA axis, CRH is also secreted locally at peripheral sites, (peripheral or immune CRH) and may influence the immune system directly through local modulatory actions. ${}^{1,17}$ It appears that mast cells are the targets of immune CRH, clusters of which are found in periarterial sympathetic plexuses and plexuses of nerve fibers within lymphoid parenchyma. Peripheral CRH activates mast cells via a CRH type 1 receptor-dependent mechanism, leading to the release of histamine and other contents of the mast cell granules. In turn, histamine acting through the H1 receptor may induce acute inflammation and allergic reactions, while through activation of H2 receptor may induce suppression of Th1 activity and a Th2 shift. ${}^{18,19}$ Thus, the activation of the CRH–mast cell–histamine axis, through stimulation of H2 receptors, might shift the Th1–Th2 balance toward a Th2 phenotype.

# Adrenal DHEA and Th1–Th2 Balance

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) is produced by the adrenal glands and is found in the plasma mainly as its sulfated derivative, DHEAS. As one of the effectors of the HPA axis, DHEA supports the body’s adaptive stress response and may be involved in immune regulation. Circumstantial evidence suggests that DHEA is involved in immune homeostasis by promoting Th1 and inhibiting Th2-type responses.²⁰ During acute stress, a dissociation of DHEA from cortisol release is observed in that the secretion of DHEA is decreased.²¹ This implies that under stressful conditions, the reduced DHEA secretion may allow a shift away from Th1 toward Th2-type activity.²⁰

# Oxidative Stress and Th1–Th2 Balance

Glutathione (GSH) in its reduced form is the single most important regulatory antioxidant in cells. As it is oxidized, it becomes oxidized glutathione (GSSG), and the intracellular ratio of GSH:GSSG is a useful measure of the cell’s overall antioxidant status.²² Studies in mice by Peterson *et al.* have shown that depletion of GSH from APCs *in vivo* results in lower Th1 activity and higher Th2 activity, whereas GSH repletion had the opposite effect.²³ Along the same lines, Murata *et al.* showed that macrophages with most of their GSH in the reduced form are effectively type 1 cells capable of inducing Th1 differentiation, whereas macrophages with mostly GSSG are effectively type 2 cells and could induce Th2 responses.²⁴ It appears therefore that immune response can have Th1 or Th2 character depending on the relative antioxidant status of the APCs directing this process. The same group also demonstrated that high GSH inside the macrophage supports gene activity that leads to secretion of IL-12, the major Th1-polarizing cytokine. Furthermore, exposure of the macrophage to INF-γ tends to raise its GSH, thereby reinforcing its orientation toward type 1. Conversely, exposure of the macrophage to IL-4 lowers its GSH and steers it toward type 2 activity.²⁵

It can be concluded that antioxidant status at the level of APCs and their microenvironment can markedly affect the ultimate pattern of immune response. Thus conditions associated with increased oxidative stress may deplete APCs of antioxidants and influence their phenotypic orientation toward Th2-type response.

# TH1–TH2 BALANCE AND DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION OF THYROID AUTOIMMUNITY

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD), the most common organ-specific autoimmune condition, may be clinically expressed as chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or HT and its variants postpartum and sporadic thyroiditis, GD, and

atrophic thyroiditis.²⁶ The main thyroid autoantigens in AITD are thyroglobulin (TG), thyroid peroxidase (TPO), and the TSH receptor (TSHr).

HT is characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid parenchyma causing a diffuse or micronodular goiter, the presence of anti-TPO and/or anti-TG antibodies in serum, and varying degrees of thyroid hypofunction. The intrathyroidal immune cells are both T and B lymphocytes with CD4⁺ Th1-subtype predominating, although Th2 cells are also present.²⁷ Thyroid follicular cells in close proximity to the infiltrating immune cells appear apoptotic, suggesting immune-mediated destruction of these cells.²⁸

On the other hand, GD manifests with follicular cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia causing a diffuse goiter and hyperthyroidism. There is patchy lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid, not as massive as in HT, and the majority of T lymphocytes act as CD4⁺ Th2 cells, although Th1 cells are also found. TSHr-stimulating antibodies are present, being responsible for the thyroid follicular growth and hyperfunction.²⁷,²⁹ Atrophic thyroiditis is rare and characterized by a small (atrophic) thyroid gland and clinical hypothyroidism. TSHr-blocking antibodies are present in up to 50% of patients with atrophic thyroiditis and these are responsible for thyroid gland atrophy and hypofunction.³⁰

Studies in animal models have shown that thyroid autoimmunity is a three-stage process.³¹ The first stage is characterized by an increased appearance of intrathyroidal APCs, which take up and present thyroid autoantigens together with MHC class II antigens and costimulatory molecules to Th cells. The second stage involves the interaction of the Th lymphocytes with the presented autoantigens. If immune tolerance and its regulation by costimulatory signals are lost, the outcome is the inappropriate activation of antigen-specific Th2 cells leading to clonal expansion of autoreactive CD4⁺ Th lymphocytes and antibody-producing B lymphocytes. In the final phase, the generated autoreactive T and B lymphocytes accumulate in large numbers within the thyroid parenchyma, which is turned into a “battlefield” with infiltrating lymphocytes and defending thyrocytes fighting for survival. The outcome of this interaction determines the different clinical phenotype of thyroid autoimmunity. This is largely dependent on the Th1–Th2 balance and the pattern of cytokines released in the local microenvironment.⁴,⁵

A predominant Th1-type response favoring cellular immunity may promote a proapoptotic milieu for the thyroid cells.³² Fas and/or TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)-dependent apoptotic pathways are activated by Th1 proinflammatory cytokines, and the thyroid cells undergo apoptosis, leading to HT or its variants. A predominantly Th2 activity, which favors humoral immunity, may induce antigen-specific B lymphocytes to produce anti-TSHr antibodies and create an anti-apoptotic potential for the thyroid cells. If the prevailing type of anti-TSHr antibodies is stimulatory, thyroid cell hyperplasia and hyperfunction ensue, leading to Graves’ hyperthyroidism. If, on the other hand, TSHr-inhibitory antibodies predominate, then thyroid cell atrophy and hypofunction occur, leading to atrophic thyroiditis⁵ (Fig. 1).

FIGURE 1. Role of Th1–Th2 balance in the regulation of thyroid autoimmunity and the phenotypic expression of AITD.

Thus, the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity toward GD or HT largely depends on the balance of Th1 versus Th2 immune response induced by APCs and the pattern of cytokines that predominate in the thyroid parenchyma. The fact that both conditions can develop in the same individual at different time points suggests that Th1–Th2 balance and cytokine pathways are dynamic processes that may be influenced by exogenous factors acting on APCs.

ASSOCIATION OF STRESS WITH AITD: CLINICAL EVIDENCE

The possible association between stressful life events and hyperthyroidism was initially reported by Parry in 1825 and subsequently by Graves,' von
Basedow and others.³² These early reports were followed by epidemiological observations of an increase in the incidence of GD during every major war, a condition named “Kriegsbasedow.”³⁴ Indeed, the incidence of GD in Denmark increased fourfold in 1942 compared with 1940. Hospital admissions for thyrotoxicosis in occupied Scandinavian countries increased five- to six-fold during the 1939–1945 war and returned to normal rates after the war.³⁴ A recent evidence for this association was the fivefold increase in GD as opposed to toxic nodular goiter (TNG), observed during the civil war in former Yugoslavia.³⁵ Earlier studies failed to show an increase in antithyroid drug use during the civil unrest in Northern Ireland³⁶ or an increase in stressful life events in consecutive thyrotoxic patients attending an outpatients’ clinic.³⁷ However, these reports can be criticized for failing to distinguish between GD and other causes of thyrotoxicosis. Following these early clinical observations, a number of formal case–control studies and population-based surveys using self-rated questionnaires have examined the effect of stress on the onset or the clinical course of Graves’ thyrotoxicosis.

## Effect of Stress on the Onset of GD

The first large population-based case–control study that established an association between stressful life events and the onset of GD was from Sweden. Using a self-rated questionnaire, 208 patients with newly diagnosed GD were found to have more negative life events and higher negative life event scores in the year preceding the diagnosis than 372 matched controls.³⁸ The association of stressful life events with the onset of GD was subsequently confirmed by several other case–control studies in different ethnic populations.³⁹⁻⁴¹ One of these studies from Japan reported an association of stress with GD in women but not men.⁴² These studies have been criticized because of their retrospective nature, the influence of recall bias, and the fact that thyrotoxicosis itself might manifest with anxiety and negative emotional events, raising the question of distinguishing between cause and effect.⁴³,⁴⁴ This problem was partially addressed by a more recent study.⁴⁵ The authors have compared patients with GD, patients with TNG, and healthy controls, to correct for the effect of thyrotoxicosis. A significant increase in the number of negative life events was found in the GD patients compared to TNG or normal controls.⁴⁵ This finding supports the view that stress precipitates autoimmune as opposed to non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism.

## Effect of Stress on the Clinical Course of GD

In contrast to studies on the onset of GD, few studies have examined the effect of stress on its clinical course. In a retrospective study, treatment witha benzodiazepine, in addition to antithyroid drug therapy, reduced the relapse rate from 74% in untreated patients to 29% in treated patients, suggesting that stress management was effective in improving the prognosis of GD.⁴⁶ Two prospective case–control studies also suggest that stress has a negative impact on the outcome of GD. A study from Japan investigated the association between the short-term outcome of patients with newly diagnosed GD, assessed 12 months after the start of antithyroid drug therapy, and stressful life events. The authors reported that “daily stresses” at 6 months after beginning therapy were associated with continued hyperthyroid state 12 months later.⁴⁷ This effect was seen only in women, however, as the number of males in the study was too small to reach a significant effect. In a more recent study it was shown that in GD daily stresses and some personality traits were related to the relapse rate after antithyroid drug treatment, and that stress scores correlated with the titer of anti-TSHr antibodies after the cessation of antithyroid drugs.⁴⁸

# Effect of Stress on GD: Case Reports

Apart from the epidemiological observations and case–control studies discussed above, there are also some clinical case reports that support a possible relationship between stress and the onset or outcome of GD. Thus, Misaki *et al.* reported three cases of Graves’ hyperthyroidism occurring after partial thyroidectomy for papillary carcinoma.⁴⁹ The authors suggested that surgical stress might alter immune homeostasis converting preclinical GD into full-blown hyperthyroidism. A relationship between stress with the onset and clinical course of GD has also been reported in children. Mortillo and Gardner reported four children in whom a “separation” event was related to the onset or relapse of GD.⁵⁰ We have reported five patients who developed mild autoimmune hyperthyroidism following major stressful life events including bereavement, job loss, stress at work, and major surgery.⁵¹ In each case the hyperthyroidism followed a short course (up to 6 months) on a small dose of antithyroid medication and went into remission as the stress situation resolved.

# Stress and HT

In contrast to GD, few studies have examined the possible association between stress and HT. Two case–control studies evaluated the role of stressful events in HT or postpartum thyroiditis. They concluded that stress was not a trigger in either condition.⁵²,⁵³ The onset and clinical course of HT are often insidious and the diagnosis may be delayed until the patients develop overt hypothyroidism, making it difficult to assess the role of stress in the onset and course of the disease. A recent population study also did not find a relationship between stressful life events and the presence of anti-TPO antibodies in euthyroid women.⁵⁴
In summary, the weight of evidence from the epidemiological observations, and clinical case–control studies suggests an association between stress and GD but not with HT. However, the biologic mechanisms underlying the association of stress with GD remain uncertain.

# ROLE OF STRESS IN THE CLINICAL EXPRESSION OF THYROID AUTOIMMUNITY: A UNIFYING HYPOTHESIS

Evidence from animal studies and certain clinical observations suggest that a hyperactive or hypoactive stress system may be associated with decreased or increased vulnerability to different types of autoimmune diseases.⁵⁵ Thus, Fisher rats that have a hyperactive stress system exhibit resistance to experimentally induced Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, uveitis, and experimental allergic encephalomyelitis. Conversely, Lewis rats, which have a hypoactive HPA axis, are prone to develop Th1-mediated autoimmune conditions.⁵⁵

Another experiment of nature with changes in the Th1–Th2 balance is pregnancy and the postpartum period. Pregnancy results in suppression of Th1-mediated cellular immune activity and preservation or enhancement of Th2-mediated humoral immunity. In the third trimester of pregnancy, Th1-type cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2 decline and Th2 cytokines, particularly IL-4, increase.⁵⁶ This shift appears to permit the histoincompatible fetal-placental unit to avoid rejection by a cell-mediated immune attack by the mother.

The above immune changes develop in parallel with a marked increase in glucocorticoid levels together with increases in estrogen and progesterone. These hormones suppress cell-mediated and enhance humoral immune responses, as discussed earlier. The changes in the hormonal milieu may explain why pregnant women experience remission of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and autoimmune thyroiditis, and aggravation of Th2-mediated autoimmunity such as lupus glomerulonephritis.⁵⁵,⁵⁶ Post partum, the hormonal milieu abruptly changes, with glucocorticoids, estrogens, and progesterone decreasing to subnormal levels, allowing a prompt recovery of cell-mediated immune function.⁵⁶,⁵⁷ This Th2 to Th1 “return shift” in the puerperium might explain the outbreak of postpartum thyroiditis and other Th1-mediated autoimmune conditions. Analogous clinical situations associated with a decreased stress system activity are seen during the period that follows cure from Cushing’s syndrome or discontinuation of glucocorticoid therapy.¹,⁵⁵ These situations have been associated with increased susceptibility to Th1-mediated immune disorders. This might also include the period that follows cessation of chronic stress or a rebound reaction upon relief of various stressors.

On the other hand, GD is reported to be associated with allergic rhinitis, and Th2-predominant conditions are frequently associated with allergic diseases.⁵⁸

Further support for the importance of the Th2 pathway in GD comes from work showing that recurrence after antithyroid drug therapy is more likely after attacks of allergic rhinitis and elevated IgE levels, which is a marker of Th2 activity.⁵⁹ Moreover, humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody therapy for multiple sclerosis, which causes the immune response to change from the Th1 to Th2 phenotype, was reported to trigger the development of GD.⁶⁰

In light of the information currently available, the following hypothesis for the role of stress in the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity is proposed (Fig. 2). Genetic and environmental factors may induce an aberrant immune response against thyroid autoantigens and render an individual susceptible to develop thyroid autoimmunity. The potential for the APCs to activate differentiation of precursor Th cells toward Th1- or Th2-type cells is an important branch point toward the development of cell-mediated or humoral immunity, respectively. If such an individual is under stress, the stress hormones will influence the APC to steer the balance toward a Th2-type activity. Effector Th2 cells and type 2 cytokines will induce antigen-specific B lymphocytes to produce anti-TSHr antibodies. The parallel suppression of Th1-effector pathway will protect thyroid cells from immune attack. Under these circumstances, the clinical outcome is GD. Conversely, if a susceptible individual is recovering

from a stress response or the immune suppressive effect of pregnancy, a rebound reaction may create the potential for APCs to activate the Th1-mediated pathway, leading to cellular immunity and destruction of thyroid follicular cells. The likely outcome then will be autoimmune (sporadic) or postpartum thyroiditis, respectively.

# CONCLUSION

Circumstantial evidence suggests that the AITD HT, and GD manifest a different immune phenotype. HT is predominantly a Th1-mediated autoimmune disease, whereas GD has a predominant Th2 phenotype. There is strong evidence from epidemiologic and clinical studies supporting an association between stress and GD, but there are few reports on the relationship of stress with HT. However, whether stress has a causative effect on GD is not yet clear. It is likely that in susceptible individuals, stress hormones influence the clinical expression of thyroid autoimmunity toward the development of GD by suppressing cellular immunity and potentiating humoral immunity. Recovery from stress, through a rebound effect, may favor the development of autoimmune thyroiditis. This is, however, a working hypothesis based on circumstantial evidence and further clarification is required.
