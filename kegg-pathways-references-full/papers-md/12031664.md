## Summary

The pikromycin (Pik) polyketide synthase (PKS) from *Streptomyces venezuelae* comprises four multifunctional polypeptides (PikAI, PikAII, PikAIII, and PikAIV). This PKS can generate 12- and 14-membered ring macrolactones (10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide, respectively) through the activity of its terminal modules (PikAIII and PikAIV). We performed a series of experiments involving the functional replacement of PikAIV in mutant strains with homodimeric and heterodimeric PikAIV modules to investigate the details of macrolactone ring size determination. The results suggest a new and surprising mechanism by which the penultimate hexaketide chain elongation intermediate is transferred from PikAIII ACP$_{5}$ to PikAIV ACP$_{6}$ before release by the terminal thioesterase domain. Elucidation of this chain transfer mechanism provides important new details about alternative macrolactone ring size formation in modular PKSs and contributes to the potential for rational design of structural diversity by combinatorial biosynthesis.

## Introduction

Polyketides are a diverse class of natural products that possess antibiotic, immunosuppressive, anti-cancer, and other biological activities [1]. The synthesis of many of these compounds depends on the activity of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs), which are giant and complex multienzyme systems that catalyze the condensation of simple carboxylic acids such as acetate and propionate [2–5]. The enzymatic activities responsible for each successive condensation reaction are physically grouped and have been designated “modules” [3]. Each module contains an acyl transfer (AT) domain that loads an appropriate extender unit onto an acyl carrier protein (ACP). The ketosynthase (KS) domain catalyzes a Claisen condensation between the extender unit and the growing polyketide chain from the proceeding module, generating an ACP-bound β-carbonyl intermediate.

The extent of the β-carbonyl group reduction that precedes the next chain extension is determined by the presence of a ketoreductase (KR), an enoyl reductase (ER), and a dehydratase (DH) within the module. A thioesterase (TE) domain covalently linked to the final module cleaves the acyl chain, presumably from the adjacent ACP domain, and this cleavage leads to the formation of a macrolactone.

Biochemical analysis of the erythromycin PKS (DEBS1, DEBS2, and DEBS3) resulted in the development of a model in which the DEBS multienzymes are dimeric and each module interacts with its complement in a helical arrangement that is both head-to-head and head-to-tail [6]. Mutagenesis studies with the DEBS1+TE protein that contains active site mutations in individual KS, AT, and ACP domains have been used to model the functional dimerization of polyketide synthases [7, 8]. Homodimeric complexes of these mutants failed to make the predicted triketide lactone product when provided with methylmalonyl-CoA as a substrate. However, specific heterodimeric complexes of these mutants were functional, indicating that the mutations disrupted the catalytic activity of the complex and not the structure or dimerization. These efforts have demonstrated that the KS domain within a module interacts with the ACP on the complementary polypeptide, whereas the AT domain can act on either ACP [7, 8].

*Streptomyces venezuelae* ATCC 15439 is known to produce the 12-membered ring macrolides methymycin, neomethymycin, and novamethymycin [9] as well as the 14-membered ring macrolides narbomycin and pikromycin (Figure 1). These 12- and 14-membered ring macrolides are derived from the aglycones, 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide, respectively. A single PKS containing four separate polypeptides (PikAI-PikAIV) is responsible for synthesis of the aglycone intermediates. Initiation of polyketide biosynthesis by PikAI and elongation through PikAIII provide hexaketide (1) and lead to 10-deoxymethynolide, whereas narbonolide production requires an additional extension of the hexaketide chain intermediate with methylmalonylCoA. This extension is catalyzed by PikAIV and leads to heptaketide (2).

The unique ability of the Pik PKS to generate 12- and 14-membered ring macrolactones presents an opportunity to explore the fundamental processes of polyketide synthesis, specifically the mechanistic details of the chain extension process and the flexibility of the TE domain. Previous complementation experiments with a mutant strain of *S. venezuelae* that expresses PikAIV lacking a TE domain demonstrated that alternative expression of the final module determines macrolactone ring size [10]. Expression of full-length PikAIV [the last module required for hexaketide (1) to heptaketide (2) chain elongation] generates the 14-membered ring macrolactone narbonolide, whereas expression of an N-terminally truncated form of PikAIV (in which the alternative translation start codon 600 amino acids downstream of the normal *pikAIV* start codon is used) results in synthesis of the 12-membered ring macrolactone 10-deoxy-

Figure 2. Chromosomal Arrangement of Pik PKS Genes in Wild-Type S. venezuelae and the pikAIVΔ Strain, HYK 954

In HYK 954, the pikAIV gene has been replaced with the kanamycin resistance gene ($aphII$). The E. coli-Streptomyces shuttle vector pDHS 4162 expresses pikAIV under the control of the PikAl promoter (P$pikA$) and restores production of both 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide. This figure uses the following abbreviations: apr, apramycin resistance; SCP2*, Streptomyces origin of replication; colEI, E. coli origin of replication.

mutant in which the entire pikAIV gene was replaced by a kanamycin-resistance gene cassette ($aphII$) [12]. As predicted, the HYK 954 mutant produced no detectable levels of macrolide antibiotics. Production is fully restored by transformation of the mutant strain with pDHS 4162 (PikAIV(WT)) (Figure 2; [13]), but not by plasmids encoding the TE domain (pDHS 704), ACP$_6$-TE domains (pDHS 705), and AT$_6$-ACP$_6$-TE domains (pDHS 708) of PikAIV (our unpublished data). S. venezuelae AX912 transformants containing pDHS 704, pDHS 705, and pDHS 708 were grown under the same conditions as controls, and partial restoration of macrolide biosynthesis was observed as previously reported (Table 1; [10]). We considered two explanations for the ability of these plasmids to complement AX912 but not HYK 954. First, the plasmid-encoded truncated PikAIV proteins might require a unique interaction with AX912-encoded PikAIV [KS$_6$-AT$_6$-ACP$_6$] for TE-dependent release of hexaketide (1) from PikAIII ACP$_5$. Alternatively, the PikAIII hexaketide bound to ACP$_5$ may “skip” to ACP$_6$ of the AX912-encoded PikAIV protein [KS$_6$-AT$_6$-ACP$_6$], with the TE proteins (from the expression plasmids) catalyzing subsequent chain release. It is also important to note for these experiments and those reported previously [14] that the proposed heterodimeric forms of PikAIV are functional, whereas neither the N-terminally (AT$_6$-ACP$_6$-TE) nor the C-terminally truncated KS$_6$-AT$_6$-ACP$_6$ homodimeric forms of PikAIV are able to generate 10-deoxymethynolide.

In an effort to determine which Pik module 6 domain(s) are required for the 10-deoxymethynolide biosynthesis, we individually mutated the KS$_6$, AT$_6$, and ACP$_6$ active site residues of PikAIV. Specifically, the PikAIV KS$_6$ domain active site Cys (C207A), the AT$_6$ active site Ser (S652A), and the Ser phosphopantetheinylation site (S980A) in ACP$_6$ were individually inactivated by site-directed mutagenesis, yielding plasmids pDHS 4176 (KS$^-$), pDHS 4179(AT$^-$), and pDHS 4163(ACP$^-$), respectively. In contrast to pDHS 4162-expressing PikAIV (WT), which completely restored antibiotic production to wild-type levels in S. venezuelae HYK 954, transformation of HYK 954 with pDHS 4176(KS$^-$), pDHS 4179(AT$^-$), and pDHS 4163(ACP$^-$) failed to produce significant levels of either 12- or 14-membered ring macrolide compounds by TLC or LC/MS analysis (data not shown). The inability of these mutant forms of PikAIV to produce 12-membered ring macrolide derivatives in the HYK 954 pikAIV deletion mutant strain indicated an essential role for the KS$_6$, AT$_6$, and ACP$_6$ active site residues, consistent with a “domain skipping” mechanism.

Formation of Functional Heterodimeric PKSs between Domain-Inactivated PikAIV Polypeptides and a TE-Deleted PikAIV

Although the homodimeric forms of PikAIV(KS$^-$), PikAIV (AT$^-$), and PikAIV(ACP$^-$) were unable to restore 12-membered ring macrolactone formation in HYK 954, we predicted that they would be capable of heterodimeriza-

tion with TE-deficient PikAIV expressed in AX912 and that restoration of 10-deoxymethynolide production would confirm the conformational stability of the site-directed mutants (Figure 3). Consistent with these predictions, pDHS4176 [PikAIV(KS⁻)] restored production of 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide to levels that are similar to that observed with pDHS4162 [PikAIV (WT)]. Transformation of AX912 with pDHS4179 [PikAIV (AT⁻)] and pDHS4163 [PikAIV(ACP⁻)] also resulted in restoration of macrolactone levels, but with elevated 10-deoxymethynolide production relative to narbonolide (Table 1). The overall production of aglycones was significantly higher in AX912 strains complemented with pDHS4176 [PikAIV (KS⁻)], pDHS4179 [PikAIV(AT⁻)], and pDHS4163 [PikAIV(ACP⁻)] than it was in AX912 strains complemented with plasmids pDHS704, pDHS705, pDHS708 that express N-terminally truncated forms of PikAIV (Table 1; compare lines 2–4 with lines 5–8).

In contrast, introduction of pDHS3007 expressing the terminal module (TylAV, module 7) from the tylosin PKS cluster (GenBank accession number U78289) into AX912 resulted in only trace production of 10-deoxymethynolide (Table 1, line 9). Similarly, pDHS3017 and pDHS3023 that provide the respective plasmid-based expression of hybrid modules in which Pik KS₆ and KS₆-AT₆ domains are substituted for the corresponding tylosin domains (e.g., KS₆-[AT₇-ACP₇-TE]$_{Tyl}$ and KS₆-AT₆-[ACP₇-TE]$_{Tyl}$) did not improve the production of 10-deoxymethynolide in strain AX912 (Table 1, lines 10 and 11).

Formation of Functional Heterodimeric PKSs between Domain-Inactivated PikAIV Polypeptides and an Inactive Engineered PikAIV Containing an AT-ACP Domain Switch

In a recent study of molecular recognition parameters in the Pik PKS, a series of hybrid modules comprising domains from Pik module 6 and modules 13 and 14 from the rapamycin (Rap) PKS cluster demonstrated that functional interactions could form between modules containing domains from these two systems [14]. For example, S. venezuelae strain SC1016 contains Rap ACP₁₄ in place of the PikAIV ACP₆ domain, and the resulting hybrid module produces only the 12-membered ring macrolactone 10-deoxymethynolide (Table 2, Line 1). In light of the current study, this result suggests that substitution of the PikAIV ACP₆ for Rap ACP₁₄ does not prevent the skipping of hexaketide (1) but does impair extension of the chain with methylmalonyl-CoA. Either the incorporation of a unique linker region between the AT₆ and ACP₁₄ domains or the identity of the ACP domain disturbs the catalytic center formed by the dimerization of monomers such that the hexaketide chain can skip (e.g., transfer) to the ACP₆ domain via a flexible 4′-phosphopantetheine group but not be extended. It is notable that substitution of AT₁₃ sequence from the Rap PKS into PikAIV produced a hybrid capable of synthesizing both 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide, thus highlighting the importance of domain linker regions and/or identity of the ACP in forming a fully functional module [14]. It is not clear if the extension reaction fails in the hybrid KS₆-AT₆[-ACP₁₄]$_{Rap}$-TE because the ACP domain remains unprimed with a methylmalonyl extender unit as a result of poor communication between AT₆ and ACP₁₄ or if the extender unit is loaded on the ACP but not capable of reacting with the hexaketide chain on the KS₆ active site. In contrast, S. venezuelae strain SC1017 in which PikAIV KS₆-AT₆-ACP₆-TE has been exchanged by Pik KS₆-[AT₁₄-ACP₁₄]$_{Rap}$-TE produces neither 10-deoxymethynolide nor the predicted 2-des-methyl-narbonolide [14]. Plasmid-based expression of this hybrid PikAIV in strain AX912, however, does lead to restoration of macrolide production, demonstrating that this

Figure 4. Proposed Mechanism of Narbonolide and 10-Deoxymethynolide Biosynthesis by PikAIV

The bold line indicates the major path of the polyketide chain through the individual domains of the terminal module. Transfer of the hexaketide (1) covalently bound to the ACP₅ domain of PikAlll to the KS₆ domain of the full-length PikAIV results in elongation to the heptaketide (2) and release as narbonolide. The N-terminally truncated form of PikAIV catalyzes the transfer of the hexaketide (1) from the ACP₅ domain of PikAll to the catalytic cysteine residue in the PikAIV KS₆ domain. Translocation of the hexaketide (1) to the PikAIV ACP₆ domain on the complementary polypeptide leads to release and cyclization to 10-deoxymethynolide. The dashed line indicates the possible intrapoly peptide transfer of the chain elongation intermediate (1).

ide, in contrast with results from the AX912 strain. This observation is consistent with previous suggestions that KS₆ and AT₆ are important components for dimerization of PikAIV polypeptides and are thus required for generation of significant levels of active heterodimers. Substantial levels of macrolide biosynthesis were observed when SC1017 was transformed with plasmids that expressed both PikAIV(WT) (pDHS4162) and PikAIV containing mutations in KS₆ (pDHS4176), AT₆ (pDHS4179), or ACP₆ (pDHS4163) (Table 2). This result confirms that KS₆ is an important factor for dimerization and thus formation of functional PikAIV heterodimers. More importantly, these results demonstrate that the PikAIV proteins carrying mutations in the KS, AT, and ACP domains are able to generate active heterodimers both with the PikAIV in SC1017 (KS₆-[AT₁₄-ACP₁₄]Rap-TE) and with AX912 (KS₆-AT₆-ACP₆). In SC1017, 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide production was comparable to that observed with AX912 containing pDHS4162 (compare Table 1, line 5 with Table 2, line 6). When pDHS4176 [PikAIV(KS⁻)] was used to transform S. venezuelae SC1017, the resulting recombinant strain was able to produce both 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide, but at reduced levels. SC1017 transformants containing pDHS4179 [PikAIV(AT⁻)] and pDHS4163 [PikAIV(ACP⁻)] produced higher levels of 10-deoxymethynolide, but neither narbonolide nor 2-des-methylnarbonolide was detected (a similar shift compared with the same complementation experiment in AX912). Although these site-directed mutant forms of PikAIV were able to produce high levels of aglycones in AX912, the reduced production observed in SC1017 might reflect less efficient dimerization between PikAIV polypeptides containing a single point mutation and Pik KS₆-[AT₁₄-ACP₁₄]Rap-TE than that between the same polypeptides and Pik KS₆-AT₆-ACP₆.

Mechanism of Skipping of the Hexaketide Chain Elongation Intermediate (1) in S. venezuelae

Our working model predicts that a homodimeric, N-terminally truncated form of PikAIV accepts the hexaketide intermediate from PikAlll and is required for the majority of 10-deoxymethynolide biosynthesis in a wild-type strain. The frequency of heterodimer formation between

full-length and truncated PikAlV and the ability of such a heterodimer to synthesize either narbonolide or 10-deoxymethynolide remains to be determined because the expression of each form in the fermentation experiments presented herein would be impossible to ascertain. In the current study, homodimers of the pikAlV-encoded site-directed mutants are nonfunctional, but the observed functionality of heterodimers allows us to assess the activity of each catalytic domain in 10-deoxymethynolide biosynthesis. A heterodimer between the chromosomally expressed PikAlV KS₆-AT₆-ACP₆ in AX912 and any of the three pikAlV-encoded site-directed mutants would comprise one thioesterase domain and only one functional active site for either the KS, AT or ACP domains. There would be two native copies of each of the remaining catalytic domains. Therefore, we constructed a mutant form of PikAlV with both C207A and S980A substitutions and used this in complementation studies with AX912. In this example, the heterodimer would contain one polypeptide with native active site residues for the KS, AT, and ACP domains but no thioesterase and the complementary polypeptide with a TE domain but inactive KS and ACP domains. When pDHS 4182 was introduced into AX912, a decrease in overall yield (15%) of macrolides was observed relative to that observed in complementation experiments with the plasmids expressing single point mutations in PikAlV. This decrease in yield along with a shift toward 10-deoxymethynolide production (as observed in complementation experiments) resulted in no detectable levels of narbonolide (Table 1, line 9). In a skipping model for 10-deoxymethynolide biosynthesis,

the observations of narbonolide biosynthesis require that the chain-elongated product on ACP₆ is cleaved by a TE domain on the opposite polypeptide strand. The model also requires that for some module skipping to occur, it is sufficient to have the KS, AT, and ACP domains present on just one polypeptide, whereas more efficient skipping occurs if domains on the other polypeptide are active (lines 5–8 versus line 9 of Table 1). As a further test for this hypothesis, we carried out a complementation experiment with pDHS4182. In this experiment, the plasmid-based KS-AT-ACP-TE would form a heterodimer with a hybrid PikAlV containing an inactive AT domain (AT₁₄). In this case, no significant levels of either 10-deoxymethyolide or narbonolide were observed.

The ability of the active site mutant forms of PikAlV to synthesize normal levels of 12-membered ring products in AX912 and SC1017, but not HYK954, indicates an essential role for the core catalytic domains in the synthesis of 10-deoxymethynolide and is consistent with the hexaketide being transferred to Pik ACP₆ prior to TE-dependent release. However, the mechanistic details of chain transfer from PikAlII ACP₅ to PikAlV ACP₆ remain unclear. Consideration of the normal activities of these domains and the complementation results presented herein and elsewhere [7, 8] suggests that in a model involving a dimeric modular PKS, an individual catalytic center consists of a KS domain and an ACP domain that are located on either the same or opposite polypeptide chains. Previously it has been suggested that the KS domain works only on the ACP domain of the opposite chain [8]. Elongation of the polyketide chain

requires translocation of the chain from the preceding ACP domain to the KS domain, where condensation with the extender unit attached to the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group of the ACP in the same module results in growth of the chain and its transfer between proteins in the dimer. In 10-deoxymethynolide biosynthesis, the interaction between PikAllI and the N-terminally truncated PikAlV allows the polyketide chain to be translocated via the flexible 4′-phosphopantetheine group from PikAllI ACP₅ to the catalytic cysteine of KS₆ (possibly exposed by the N-terminal truncation). Movement of the ACP₆ 4′-phosphopantetheine group, presumably lacking the methylmalonyl CoA extender unit, toward the “loaded” cysteine of KS₆ may allow direct thiol transfer of the hexaketide to the ACP either on the same or on the opposite polypeptide in the dimer complex. The activity of the TE in an interpolypeptide-, and possible intrapolypeptide-, catalyzed reaction cleaves the ACP₆ bound hexaketide product to generate 10-deoxymethynolide (Figure 4). The translocation of the hexaketide from PikAllI ACP₅ through KS₆ to PikAlV ACP₆ appears to require the activity of the AT₆ domain. This result is consistent with previous conclusions that the identity and/or activity of the AT domain is an important structural determinant for facilitating TE-catalyzed production of 10-deoxymethynolide [14]. It is worth noting, however, that in a complementation study with SC1017 and pDHS4179, the heterodimer containing an AT₆ mutant and RapAT₁₄-containing PikAlV (which is not functional as homodimeric PikAlV) produces significant levels of 10-deoxymethynolide. This observation is consistent with a mechanism in which skipping of the hexaketide chain to the ACP₆ domain requires a 4′-phosphopantetheine group that is not loaded with a methylmalonyl extender unit. The structural or catalytic role of AT₆ in the production of 10-deoxymethynolide is an important component of our continued analysis of the specific biochemical details of the domain-skipping mechanism.

Significance

Polyketides are a structurally diverse class of compounds that have been developed as pharmaceuticals for the treatment of cancer and infection. The synthesis of many of these compounds depends on the activity of modular polyketide synthases (PKSs) that elongate simple carboxylic acids as intermediates bound to separate acyl carrier proteins (ACP). The naturally occurring pikromycin polyketide synthase from Streptomyces venezuelae contains four polypeptides (PikAl-PikAlV) and has the unique ability to generate 12- and 14-membered ring macrolactones, 10-deoxymethynolide and narbonolide, respectively, by the activity of the thioesterase domain located in the terminal module, PikAlV. Extension of the hexaketide chain intermediate from PikAllI by PikAlV leads to formation of the 14-membered ketolide ring narbonolide, whereas release of the hexaketide results in the formation of 10-deoxymethynolide. While some interaction between PikAllI and an individual TE domain can allow for direct release of the hexaketide from the ACP₅ domain, experimental evidence suggests that more efficient release of the acyl chain is accomplished with a TE domain at the C terminus of PikAlV that contains catalytically competent KS, AT, and ACP domains. This data is consistent with the majority of the hexaketide chain intermediate being transferred to the PikAlV ACP₆ domain prior to release and cyclization to 10-deoxymethynolide. A more thorough understanding of this mechanism will contribute to our overall knowledge of polyketide chain transfer mechanisms as well as to the development of novel termination activities for combinatorial biosynthesis.

Experimental Procedures

Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions

E. coli DH5α was used as a host for the manipulation of plasmid DNA. Wild-type Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 and the derivative mutant strains HYK954, AX912, SC1016, and SC1017 have been described previously [10, 13, 14]. Plasmids and S. venezuelae strains used as production hosts for the engineered expression plasmids in this study are summarized in Table 3. S. venezuelae transformants were grown on R2YE agar plates and then transferred to sporulation agar for production of spores and antibiotics.

Construction of Complementation Vectors

Complementation vectors are all derivatives of pDHS702 and pDHS618, which both contain Streptomyces SCP2* low-copy origin [15] and an E. coli colE origin and use the pikAl promoter to express gene inserts. Derivatives of these plasmids were transformed into S. venezuelae by the standard protoplast transformation procedure [16]. Plasmids were selectively maintained in S. venezuelae with thiostrepton (pDHS702 derivatives) and apramycin (pDHS618 derivatives) at a concentration of 25 μg/ml. Manipulation of plasmid DNA was performed by standard cloning procedures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was performed with the pfu polymerase (Stratagene) under conditions recommended by the manufacturer. The 3′ end of the pikAlV gene was cloned as a 2.3 kb EcoRI-BamHI fragment from pLZ51 into pLITMUS28 (New England Biolabs) to yield pDHS4147. The 5′ end of pikAlV was generated as a 2.4 kb BglII-EcoRI fragment, was amplified from pLZ51 with the primers 5′-AAAAGATCTGACCCGACCGCGGTGCCTGCCCCA-3′ and 5′-GGCGGCGAAATTCGGGTGAGCTGTGC-3′, and was cloned into pLITMUS to yield pDHS4172. The BglII-EcoRI insert from pDHS4147 and an EcoRI-Xbal insert from pDHS4172 were cloned into pDHS4618 that had been digested with BamHI and Xbal to yield pDHS4162. The pDHS4175 plasmid was constructed in a similar manner except that the EcoRI-Xbal insert from pDHS4147 was first cloned into pUC118 so that the fragment could be digested with EcoRI-PstI and cloned into the Nsil site of pDHS702.

Site-directed mutagenesis of the active site residues in the pikAlV KS, AT, and ACP domains was accomplished by standard PCR methodologies and confirmed by DNA sequencing. The plasmid pDHS4163 expresses a mutant form of pikAlV in which the sequence encoding the ACP active site sequence has been changed to GAT GCA TTG, creating a diagnostic Nsil site and resulting in a S980A mutation. Plasmid pDHS4176 expresses a mutant form of PikAlV in which the sequence encoding the KS catalytic cysteine has been changed to GCG GCT ACG, creating a diagnostic Nhel site and resulting in a C207A mutation. Plasmid pDHS4179 expresses a mutant form of PikAlV in which the sequence encoding the AT active site serine has been changed to CAT GCG CAG, creating a diagnostic FspI site that results in a S652A mutation. Plasmid pDHS4182 expresses a mutant form of PikAlV containing both C207A and S980A substitutions.

Purification and Characterization of Polyketide Production

Production of pikromycin-related polyketides was determined on solid phase medium. Spore suspensions were spread onto 25 ml of sporulation agar containing appropriate antibiotics and were grown at 30°C for 3 days. The agar was first extracted with 50 ml

of methanol for 1 hr. The dried extract was dissolved in 25 ml of water and then extracted with 25 ml of ethyl acetate. The dried ethyl acetate extract was resuspended in 500 μl of acetonitrile for analysis. For silica thin-layer-chromatography analysis, the aglycone compounds were separated with a chloroform: methanol (95:5) solvent, and the glycosylated/hydroxylated products were separated with a chloroform:methanol: 25% NH₄OH (90:10:1) solvent. All compounds were visualized by vanillin staining and heating [17]. HPLC analysis of extracts allowed quantitative comparison of polyketide production between strains. Sample extracts were injected into a C-18 reverse-phase HPLC analytical column (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 10 μm particle size) and eluted with a 30 min gradient of 50%–90% acetonitrile buffered with 10 mM ammonium acetate (pH 9.0). Peak areas were integrated compared to a standard curve generated with purified compounds. Antibiotic production was averaged from at least three separate S. venezuelae transformants.
