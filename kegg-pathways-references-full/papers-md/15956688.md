**ABSTRACT:** Recent studies have identified four receptors that are the physiological targets for relaxin family peptides. All are class I (rhodopsin like) G-protein-coupled receptors with LGR7 (RXFP1) and LGR8 (RXFP2) being type C leucine-rich repeat-containing receptors, whereas GPCR135 (RXFP3) and GPCR142 (RXFP4) resemble receptors that respond to small peptides such as somatostatin and angiotensin II. The cognate ligands for the receptors have been identified: relaxin for RXFP1; INSL3 for RXFP2; relaxin 3 for RXFP3 and INSL5 for RXFP4. RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptors produce increases in intracellular cAMP levels upon stimulation, although the response is complex and contains a component sensitive to PI-3-kinase inhibitors. There is also evidence that RXFP1 can activate Erk1/2 and nitric oxide synthase, and relaxin has been reported to enter cells and activate glucocorticoid receptors. In contrast, RXFP3 and RXFP4 couple to Gi by a pertussis toxin-sensitive mechanism to cause inhibition of cAMP production. Now that the receptors for relaxin family peptides and their cognate ligands have been identified, we suggest a nomenclature for both the peptides and the receptors that we hope will be helpful to researchers in this rapidly advancing field.

## INTRODUCTION

In the early 1920s, Hisaw$^{1}$ investigated the physiologic changes that occur in the pubic symphysis during pregnancy in guinea pigs. He reported that when virgin female guinea pigs, close to estrus, were injected with serum taken from pregnant rabbits, there was relaxation of the pubic ligaments similar to that naturally occurring in pregnancy.$^{1}$ The substance responsible for the relaxation could be obtained

tor binding site within the B chain along the dimer interface. Although the homology between relaxins across species is not great (30–70%), there is conservation of the cysteine residues required for inter- and intrachain disulfide bond formation, the residues that make up the hydrophobic core and the Arg-X-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile/Val motif in the B chain required for relaxin binding.<sup>4</sup>

In recent years the relaxin family of peptides has expanded with the discovery of five more relaxin-related peptide genes. The first novel gene was identified by screening a boar testis cDNA library.<sup>13</sup> Reflecting its localization to the Leydig cells of the testis, this was initially known as Ley-I-L or Leydig insulin-like peptide, but now is referred to as INSL3. The peptide contains the motif Arg-X-X-X-Arg, part of the relaxin binding motif, and interacts weakly with the relaxin receptor.<sup>14,15</sup> Subsequently, INSL4 was discovered by screening a human placental cDNA library,<sup>16</sup> and INSL5<sup>17,18</sup> and INSL6<sup>17,19</sup> were identified by searching the EST databases for insulin-like genes. Finally, a novel human relaxin gene, H3 relaxin, as well as its orthologues in mouse, rat, and pig was identified in the genome databases.<sup>20–22</sup> Like H1 and H2 relaxin, H3 relaxin has the Arg-X-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile motif in the B chain and activates the relaxin receptor albeit with lower potency than H2 relaxin. Interestingly, the highest expression levels of this peptide are in the brain,<sup>23</sup> leading to the suggestion that it is a neuropeptide rather than a reproductive hormone. Although H3 relaxin was the last relaxin-like gene identified, it is actually the ancestral relaxin gene and the other family members just outlined have evolved from an ancestral relaxin-3 gene (Wilkinson *et al.*, this volume). Hence, the peptides have been grouped as relaxin family peptides (TABLE 1).

One of the most significant advances in the relaxin field in recent years has been the identification of the receptors for relaxin and other family peptides H3 relaxin, INSL5 and INSL3 (TABLE 2). The relaxin receptor LGR7 (RXFP1) and the INSL3 receptor LGR8 (RXFP2) are type-C leucine-rich repeat containing hormone receptors (LGRs) that are class 1 (rhodopsin-like) G-protein-coupled receptors.<sup>24</sup> The LGR8 receptor (or GREAT) was identified due to the similar cryptorchid phenotype of the LGR8<sup>25</sup> and INSL3 KO mice<sup>26,27</sup> and subsequently confirmed by pharmac-

logic studies. ${}^{28}$ The similarities (paralogous relationships) between relaxin and INSL3 and LGR8 and LGR7 then led to the identification of LGR7 as the relaxin receptor. ${}^{24}$ Unlike the ligands, both the LGR7 and the LGR8 receptors were highly conserved across species ${}^{29,30}$ (and other papers in this volume). Other relaxin family peptide receptors were discovered using a different approach. An orphan receptor was isolated from a human brain cDNA library ${}^{31}$ comprising a protein of 469 amino acids having the highest sequence identity to somatostatin and angiotensin receptors. This receptor was therefore termed SALPR (GPCR135) for somatostatin and angiotensin-like receptor, even though it did not bind to either somatostatin or angiotensin II. ${}^{31}$ The orphan GPCR135 was then used as a bait to identify a ligand from brain extracts ${}^{23}$ because of the wide distribution of this receptor in brain. The ligand eluted with a molecular weight of 4–6 kDa by HPLC gel filtration ${}^{23}$ and was subsequently identified as relaxin-3. [${}^{125}$I]-H3 relaxin binding to GPCR135 was displaced by H3 relaxin or its B chain (TABLE 3) ${}^{23}$ but not by porcine relaxin, insulin, INSL3, INSL4, INSL6, or A-chain H3 relaxin. ${}^{23}$ Unlike LGR7, GPCR135 coupled to Gi and inhibited cAMP accumulation in response to forskolin. ${}^{23,32}$ Similar studies carried out with a related receptor, GPCR142, revealed that it had similar ligand specificity and signaling properties. ${}^{33}$ Recent experiments have demonstrated that GPCR142 is likely the receptor for INSL5. ${}^{34}$ In contrast to the LGR7 and LGR8 receptors, both GPCR135 and GPCR142 have short N-terminal domains, relatively short intracellular loops, and a long C-terminus containing a number of potential phosphorylation sites. The LGR7, LGR8, GPCR135, and GPCR142 receptors are all receptors for relaxin family peptides. The recommendation of the subcommittee of NC-IUPHAR dealing with receptors for relaxin and relaxin-related peptides will be that these receptors be known as RXFP1-4 receptors, respectively.

# RECEPTOR DISTRIBUTION AND FUNCTION

Receptors for relaxin family peptides have been localized by their mRNA expression patterns using RT-PCR, Northern blotting, or in situ hybridization or as protein by immunohistochemistry or receptor autoradiography (TABLE 4). All of the currently utilized methods have advantages and disadvantages, and RT-PCR and Northern blotting will specifically identify mRNA for each of the receptors concerned. The advantage of RT-PCR is the extreme sensitivity, and it is possible to amplify relatively few copies of mRNA and obtain a signal. The advent of real-time PCR allows reliable quantitation and determination whether receptor expression levels are likely to be physiologically relevant. Northern blotting is reliable but less sensitive and may necessitate large amounts of mRNA from tissues expressing receptor at reasonable levels. With highly selective probes, in situ hybridization can provide both tissue and cellular localization of receptors. Immunohistochemistry can provide both high-resolution images of cells expressing receptors and an indication of the levels of expression, but the reliability of the technique depends very much on the specificity of the antibody, which is probably best checked using another independent technique such as autoradiography. Receptor autoradiography has the advantage of providing tissue and, to some degree, cellular localization, but it has much lower resolution than immunohistochemistry as it can only be conducted with relatively unfixed tissue. One major advantage of this approach is that the specificity of the ligand can be determined by examination of the ability of a variety of related peptides to compete for binding.

Using a variety of techniques, very strong evidence has been obtained for the presence of RXFP1 (LGR7) receptors in uterus, cervix, vagina, brain, and heart of a number of species (TABLE 4). However, differences are discernible such as the presence of RXFP1 receptors in uterine myometrium in rats and mice, whereas in the human the receptor is mainly localized to the uterine endometrium. In the heart of rats and mice, the RXFP1 receptor is localized to the atria where it mediates positive inotropic and chronotropic responses, whereas no receptor binding or function has

# LIGANDS AND RECEPTORS FOR RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES

**RXFP1 and RXFP2 Receptors (LGR7 and LGR8).** Many species homologues of relaxin have been described,^{4,35} and although they display considerable amino-acid sequence diversity, they have in common the Arg-X-X-Arg-X-X-Ile/Val binding cassette. Many of the most potent relaxins such as H1, H2, porcine, and whale relaxins^{36} possess the Arg-Glu-Leu-Val-Arg-X-X-Ile sequence, and those that deviate from this sequence such as rat,^{37} shark,^{38,39} dog,^{40} and horse^{41} show a reduction in bioactivity. Shortening of the B chain of H1 relaxin produces a gradual reduction in bioactivity with a total loss of activity when the B chain is reduced to 24 amino acids.^{37} The individual A or B chains of relaxins or the structural analogues of insulin and IGF-1 have no bioactivity at the RXFP1 (LGR7) receptor.

Like the closely related leucine-rich repeat containing G-protein–coupled receptor RXFP1 (LGR7), the RXFP2 (LGR8) receptor binds and responds to H1, H2, and porcine relaxins (H1 unpublished; Scott *et al.*, this volume). However, unlike the RXFP1 receptor, RXFP2 interacts with INSL3 with high affinity and does not respond to rat relaxin. Although RXFP2 binds INSL3 with high affinity, the maximal response to H2 relaxin in functional studies has been reported to be greater^{42} (Halls *et al.*, this volume). Evidence obtained using a number of different approaches suggests the presence of a number of sites at which relaxins and related peptides interact with the RXFP1 and RXFP2 receptors. Studies with chimeras of RXFP1 and RXFP2 or with the ectodomains of these receptors expressed in HEK293T cells examined competition for binding and cAMP accumulation in response to INSL3, H2 relaxin, and H3 relaxin. INSL3 bound to and activated only RXFP2, H3 relaxin was a selective ligand for RXFP1, and H2 relaxin bound to and activated both receptors.^{43} The chimeric RXFP1/2 receptor that possesses the ectodomain of RXFP1 and the transmembrane-spanning region of RXFP2 displayed a reduced ability of H3 relaxin to compete for binding of \[^{33}\text{P}\] H2 relaxin and to generate cAMP. Replacement of exoloop 2 but not exoloop 1 or 3 led to a restoration of binding and the cAMP response, suggesting that the full activity of H3 relaxin at the RXFP1 receptor required interaction with both the ectodomain and the exoloop 2. Support for this model of receptor activation has been obtained in binding studies (Halls *et al.*; Bathgate *et al.*, this volume). Saturation binding studies conducted with RXFP2 receptors expressed in HEK293 cells with \[^{33}\text{P}\] H2 relaxin identified two binding sites with pK_D values of 9.24 and 8.35. When saturation studies were carried out on the 8BP (ectodomain fragment of RXFP2), only a single binding site was identified with a pK_D of 9.28. This suggested that the high affinity site is located in the ectodomain and the lower affinity site in the exoloop region of the transmembrane domain. This view was supported by competition studies carried out with RXFP1, RXFP2, and the RXFP1/2 chimera. INSL3 was unable to compete for binding at RXFP1 but was able to compete at RXFP1/2 with low affinity (pK_D 8.57), suggesting binding at the exo-loop region of RXFP2. At the RXFP2 receptor, INSL3 was able to compete with even higher affinity (pK_D 9.91), suggesting the presence of an additional high affinity site
in the ectodomain. Similar studies carried out with RXFP1 failed to identify two sites in saturation studies, but they could be identified by competition binding and cAMP accumulation experiments using the selectivity of rat relaxin for the RXFP1 receptor. Rat relaxin does not bind to or activate the RXFP2 receptor, but it does bind to the RXFP1 receptor or the RXFP1/2 chimera. The conclusions from the binding studies were supported by an examination of cAMP responses to the peptides using the cloned receptors. Activation by INSL3 of either the exoloop region (RXFP1/2) or the ectodomain (RXFP2/l) was able to produce a cAMP response (2.2 and 11.5 pmol/well, respectively), but full activation (13.9 pmol/well) required the intact RXFP2 receptor. Studies with the RXFP1 receptor showed that rat relaxin was able to produce a cAMP response only in RXFP1 or RXFP1/2 and not in RXFP2 or RXFP2/1, suggesting that the major interaction with this peptide occurs in the ectodomain (Halls *et al.*, this volume).

A third region associated with activation of LGR receptors is the N-terminal low-density lipoprotein class-A (LDLa) module that is unique to the type C LGRs. Interestingly, a naturally occurring splice variant of RXFP1 encodes a protein that consists primarily of the LDLa module (RXFP1 truncate). HEK293T cells cotransfected with RXFP1 and RXFP1 truncate display reduced cAMP activation when compared to cells transfected with RXFP1 and empty vector (Scott *et al.*, this volume). The results suggest that RXFP1 truncate acts as an antagonist of RXFP1 responses and that the mode of action is to bind to the transmembrane region of RXFP1 and prevent access by the LDLa module of the receptor after agonist occupation of the receptor. Another type of antagonist for the RXFP2 receptor was developed by synthesis of conformationally restrained B-chain analogues of INSL3.⁴⁴ One of these analogues competed with [³³P] H2 relaxin for binding to RXFP2 and also antagonized cAMP responses to INSL3.

Taken together, the data suggest that binding of ligands to LGR7 and LGR8 involves at least two stages: binding with high affinity to the ectodomain and binding with lower affinity to the exoloop 2 of the transmembrane domain. The role of the LDLa module appears significant but has yet to be finally elucidated. The receptors, therefore, are extremely interesting in that it should be possible to develop antagonists acting at several sites on the receptor. Agonists, however, will be most likely developed based on an interaction with at least the high affinity site in the ectodomain.

**RXFP3 and RXFP4 Receptors (GPCR135 and GPCR142)**. RXFP3 (GPCR135) was originally identified as an orphan GPCR expressed in the central nervous system.³¹ Recently, it was demonstrated that rat and porcine brain extracts stimulated GTPγS incorporation into cells overexpressing GPCR135.²³ The ligand subsequently isolated from porcine brain was H3 relaxin and it was shown to stimulate GTPγS incorporation and inhibit cAMP production at subnanomolar concentrations in cells expressing GPCR135. The receptor mRNA is expressed in the hypothalamus in the paraventricular nucleus and also in the supraoptic nucleus, cortex, and preoptic area. In binding studies using [¹²⁵I] H3 relaxin to label GPCR135, only H3 relaxin and the H3 relaxin B chain were capable of competing for binding with porcine relaxin, insulin, INSL3, INSL4, INSL6, and H3 relaxin A chain being inactive. This pattern was repeated in GTPγS incorporation assays or inhibition of cAMP accumulation.²³ The H3 relaxin B chain was about 100–500-fold less active than the H3 relaxin. Another orphan receptor, RXFP4 (GPCR142), is related to GPCR135 and was also found to be activated by H3 relaxin³³ at nanomolar concentrations. Like GPCR135,

BATHGATE et al.: RECEPTORS FOR RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES 69

GPCR142 signaling was mediated by inhibition of adenylate cyclase, and H3 relaxin also increased GTPγS incorporation. However, recently, it was shown that INSL5 is a selective ligand for GPCR142, interacting with this receptor with high affinity. By contrast, INSL5 binds weakly to GPCR135 but does not activate the receptor, and it acts as an antagonist of H3 relaxin.³⁴ Both INSL5 and GPCR142 have a wide overlapping distribution with RNA being found in many tissues including the colon, prostate, kidney, thymus, and brain. Furthermore, both the GPCR142 and INSL5 genes are pseudogenes in rats and dogs, providing strong evidence that GPCR142 is the INSL5 receptor.

FIGURE 1. Potential signaling pathways utilized by the relaxin family peptide receptor 1 (RXFP1, formerly LGR7) in a variety of cell types. The receptor can couple to adenylate cyclase (AC) via Gs and may be capable of coupling to Gi either directly or after phosphorylation by either protein kinase A (PKA) or G-protein receptor kinases (GRKs). G-protein βγ subunits then activate phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3-K), which in turn activates PKCζ, which can both stimulate adenylate cyclase (AC V/VI) to enhance cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) production and also switch on the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway to increase activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOSIII). cAMP will activate PKA, which can phosphorylate many signaling proteins but also enhance gene transcription of NOSII. Transactivation of tyrosine kinase receptors such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) can also activate PI3-K, which will switch on the P42/P44 (Erk1/2) MAP kinase pathway. There is also evidence that relaxin can enter the cell and directly activate nuclear glucocorticoid receptors (GRs). Note that it is highly likely that the relative importance of the various mechanisms indicated will vary with the cell type in which the receptor is expressed.

The elucidation of the signaling pathways for relaxin receptors (RXFP1) has occupied and challenged researchers for decades. Early studies indicated that relaxin could increase cAMP in mouse pubic symphysis⁴⁵ and rat uterus.⁴⁶,⁴⁷ More recently, a number of bioassays had been developed based on the ability of relaxin to increase intracellular levels of cAMP. These included the human monocyte cell line THP-1 and primary cultures of human endometrial stromal cells.⁴⁸⁻⁵⁰ There was also evidence that relaxin-mediated relaxation of rat myometrial smooth muscle cells involved Gs stimulation of adenylate cyclase.⁵¹,⁵² The results are not entirely consistent, however, because human lower uterine segment fibroblasts and rat cardiomyocytes display robust binding and functional responses to relaxin that were not associated with any or only small increases in cAMP accumulation.⁵³,⁵⁴ The interpretation is complicated even more by the observation that the cAMP response in THP-1 cells and human endometrial stromal cells is inhibited by tyrosine kinase inhibitors.⁵⁵ This was followed by the suggestion that activation of tyrosine kinases by relaxin led to inhibition of phosphodiesterases and accumulation of cAMP in cells. Other studies focused on the insulin-like structure of relaxin and were supported by findings that binding of [³²P]-labeled H2 relaxin followed by crosslinking and gel electrophoresis was to a component with an $M_r$ of ~220 kDa, very similar in size to the receptors for insulin, IGF-I and IGF-II.⁵⁶ In human lower uterine segment fibroblasts, there was high affinity binding of relaxin, and incubation of these cells with relaxin caused a significant increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of a protein with an $M_r$ of 220 kDa.⁵³ These studies suggested that the relaxin receptor may have been a tyrosine kinase.

The identification of RXFP1 and RXFP2 as the receptors for relaxin and INSL3²⁴ has clarified some issues and also provided useful models in which to study LGR receptor signaling. RXFP1 and RXFP2 are G-protein-coupled receptors that when expressed in HEK293T cells produce a striking increase in cAMP accumulation in response to relaxin. Furthermore, the expression of gain of function mutants of RXFP1 and RXFP2 with an Asp→Tyr mutation in transmembrane helix VI produces ligand-independent increases in cAMP accumulation, suggesting that both receptors signal through adenylate cyclase.²⁴,⁵⁷ More recent studies in THP-1 cells⁵⁸ and in HEK293T cells expressing RXFP1 receptor (Halls *et al.*, this volume) show that the cAMP response is biphasic with the second phase of the response being sensitive to inhibition by the PI3-K inhibitors LY294002 and wortmannin. In THP-1 cells the increases in cAMP did not appear to result from inhibition of PDEs because blockade of PDEs by the general inhibitor isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX) or the PDE8 inhibitor dipyridamole failed to alter either phase of the cAMP response to relaxin.⁵⁸ In HEK293T cells expressing RXFP1 receptors, cAMP responses to relaxin during the first 5 min of stimulation were not sensitive to PI3-K inhibition, whereas responses to longer periods of stimulation were inhibited by wortmannin or LY294002 (Halls *et al.*, this volume). It was of interest that the PI3-K inhibitor-sensitive component of the response was abolished by pretreatment of cells with pertussis toxin (PTX), suggesting that PI3-K activation in HEK293 cells expressing RXFP1 may be via βγ subunits derived from Gi. Because PTX sensitivity was reported not to be a feature of the responses in THP-1 cells,⁵⁵ this suggested that if activation of PI3-K

is by $\beta\gamma$ subunits, then they may be derived from G-proteins other than Gi in THP-1 cells. ${}^{58}$ Data presented at this meeting (Dessauer and Nguyen, this volume) provided convincing evidence for PKC$\zeta$ as the next step in PI3-K–mediated increases in cAMP production. Inhibition of PKC with chelerythrine reduced and activation with sphingomyelinase increased the cAMP response to relaxin. Relaxin stimulated translocation of PKC$\zeta$ to the cell membrane in a number of cell lines, an effect that was inhibited by PKC$\zeta$ antisense oligonucleotide treatment, which reduced PKC$\zeta$ mRNA and protein levels. The antisense oligonucleotide also reduced the relaxin-induced increase in cAMP levels, and the remaining response was insensitive to blockade by PI3-K inhibitors (Dessauer and Nguyen, this volume). Relaxin also activates Erk1/2 in a variety of cells known to express RXFP1 receptors. ${}^{59}$ In human endothelial stromal cells, THP-1 cells, and in primary cultures of human coronary artery and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, the addition of H2 relaxin produced rapid (<5min) phosphorylation of Erk1/2 with no change in the levels of total Erk, and the effect was blocked by inhibition of MEK. ${}^{59}$ No evidence was obtained for activation of Akt or JNK in these cells by relaxin. The transcription factor CREB was also activated by relaxin in endothelial stromal cells, but whether this results from the Erk1/2 cascade or the cAMP/PKA pathway is not clear at present. ${}^{59}$ Erk1/2 activation by relaxin has also been demonstrated in HeLa cells and human umbilical vein endothelial cells, although the much longer time course of the effect (45–90 min) suggests that this may not be the result of a direct interaction with relaxin receptors. ${}^{60}$

There is also considerable evidence that relaxin can act on cells both acutely and chronically by increasing the expression and/or activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). ${}^{61}$ Two mechanisms have been suggested, activation of NOSIII by G-protein–coupled receptor mechanisms and induction of NOSII mediated by cAMP. Activation of NOSIII by relaxin would involve stimulation of RXFP1, interaction of G-protein $\beta\gamma$ subunits with PI3-K followed by activation of Akt, and subsequently NOSIII by phosphorylation at Ser1179. Increased expression of NOSII would likely involve an increase in cAMP levels, activation of PKA, phosphorylation, and inactivation of IkB, thus promoting increased NOSII expression via NF-$\kappa$B. ${}^{61}$ Recent studies also suggest that renal vasodilation in response to relaxin involves endothelin receptors. This mechanism involves upregulation of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity by relaxin, followed by increased processing of big endothelin (ET) to yield bioactive ET${}_{1-32}$, leading via ET${}_{B}$ receptors to activation of NOSIII and increased synthesis of NO. ${}^{62}$

Relaxin has also been reported to interact with the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Treatment with relaxin reduces the production of inflammatory cytokines by human macrophages in response to endotoxin, ${}^{63}$ and the effect is blocked by the GR antagonist RU486. Relaxin enters intact cells and is concentrated in the nucleus where it induces GR activation, nuclear translocation, and DNA binding. It appears to act as a GR agonist and competes with GR agonists for binding to the GR. Because relaxins modified to have no action at the RXFP1 receptor retain activity at the GR, the effects appear to be mediated independently of an action on RXFP1.

Although the recently discovered H3 relaxin ${}^{20}$ increases cAMP in mammalian cells transfected with RXFP1 ${}^{43}$ and in THP-1 cells ${}^{20}$ suggesting the same signaling pathway as relaxin, it also acts at RXFP3 and RXFP4 receptors to inhibit cAMP accumulation, and the effect is blocked by pertussis toxin, indicating that the receptor

tor is coupled to Gi, Go, or Gz.²³,³³ Relaxin 3 is the cognate ligand for RXFP3 and INSIL5 for RXFP4 receptors.³⁴ The signaling mechanisms utilized by relaxin 3 and INSIL5 on RXFP3 and RXFP4 *in vivo* are currently unknown.

# NOMENCLATURE ISSUES FOR RELAXIN FAMILY PEPTIDES AND THEIR RECEPTORS

A brief survey of the literature over the last 3 years provided a dozen or more synonyms for relaxin including human relaxin (Rln) H-2, human relaxin-2, relaxin-2, H2 relaxin, human gene 2 relaxin (hRLX2), human RLX, relaxin (RLX), rln-1, rhRLX (recombinant human relaxin), human relaxin 2, and H2-relaxin. To prevent further possible confusion among newcomers to the field (and even some of us in the field), we recommend that the human gene 1, gene 2, and gene 3 relaxin peptides be known as H1, H2, and H3 relaxin, respectively. With the exception of primates, which possess the equivalent of H1 and H2 relaxins, most other species express only a single relaxin equivalent to H2 relaxin. It is suggested that these be known as “species” relaxin (e.g., mouse relaxin) to avoid the potential confusion caused by the attachment of numbers and the comparison with human forms. Because most other animals possess the equivalent of H3 relaxin, it is suggested that these be known as “species” relaxin-3 (e.g., mouse relaxin-3).

Fortunately, INSL3 has a shorter history than relaxin, and there are fewer synonyms in the literature for this peptide. However, INSL3 was formerly known as Ley-IL (Leydig insulin-like peptide) and RLF (relaxin-like factor) and has also been referred to as Leydig cell relaxin. It is suggested that “species” INSL3 become the designated nomenclature.

With regard to the receptors for relaxin family peptides, a strong case can now be made for suggesting that LGR7, LGR8, GPCR135, and GPCR142 were all originally receptors for relaxin-3, which is the most ancient of the relaxin peptides. However, to avoid the potential confusion inherent in suggesting that all four receptors are relaxin receptors, because the receptors have now evolved to recognize a wider range of more specialized ligands, it is suggested that the receptors be known as relaxin family peptide receptors (RXFP receptors). The four receptors for relaxin family peptides, LGR7, LGR8, GPCR135, and GPCR142, would thus become “species” RXFP1, RXFP2, RXFP3, and RXFP4 receptors, respectively.

In conclusion, although the hormone relaxin was discovered almost 80 years ago, the isolation of the receptor that it activates and the elucidation of the signaling pathways involved in the cellular responses to the peptide proved elusive. The last 5 years have seen the identification not only of the receptor for relaxin but also of three other receptors responding to relaxin family peptides with all four receptors being G-protein–coupled receptors. These discoveries have led very rapidly to the determination of the cognate ligands for the receptors, the tracing of their evolutionary history, and the determination of their signaling pathways. Although much still needs to be learned about the way in which relaxin family peptides alter the activity of cells, promising progress in the area of development of antagonists for the receptors will provide valuable new tools to assist this process.
