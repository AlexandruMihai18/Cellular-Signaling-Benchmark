**Abstract** The intracellular apicomplexan parasite *Toxoplasma gondii* is able to survive and persist in immunocompetent intermediate hosts for the host’s life span. This is despite the induction of a vigorous humoral and—more importantly—cell-mediated immune response during infection. In order to establish and maintain such chronic infections, however, *T. gondii* has evolved multiple strategies to avoid or to interfere with potentially efficient anti-parasitic immune responses of the host. Such immune evasion includes (1) indirect mechanisms by altering the expression and secretion of immunomodulatory cytokines or by altering the viability of immune cells and (2) direct mechanisms by establishing a lifestyle within a suitable intracellular niche and by interference with intracellular signaling cascades, thereby abolishing a number of antimicrobial effector mechanisms of the host. Despite the parasite’s ability to interfere successfully with the host’s efforts to eradicate the infection, the immune response is, however, not completely abrogated but is rather partially diminished after infection. *T. gondii* thus keeps a delicate balance between induction and suppression of the host’s immune response in order to guarantee the survival of the host as a safe harbor for parasite development and to allow its transmission to the definitive host.

**Introduction**

*Toxoplasma gondii* is one of the most successful intracellular protozoan parasites and is able to infect a broad range of warm-blooded vertebrate hosts including humans and livestock animals. With its ubiquitous distribution and a seroprevalence of approximately 30%, *T. gondii* is also one of the most abundant eukaryotic parasites in humans (McGavin 1996; Tenter et al. 2000). The life cycle of *T. gondii* relies on its ability to establish long-lasting chronic infections in the immunocompetent intermediate host in order to maximize the likelihood for transmission of the parasite to the definitive host which belongs to the Felidae family. This requirement may have put considerable selective pressure on *T. gondii* to evolve mechanisms which ensure parasite survival without inducing life-threatening disease of its host. There is now increasing evidence that this indeed largely depends on a number of delicate adaptations of the parasite to the host that not only enables *T. gondii* to gain essential nutrients but also to evade destruction by the host’s immune response. Consistent with the view of a balanced interaction between the parasite and the host, infection of immunocompetent hosts with *T. gondii* is usually asymptomatic or goes along with only mild and unspecific symptoms. In these individuals, the immune response is clearly instrumental in restricting parasite replication and avoiding overt disease, but is unable to clear the infection. In contrast, *T. gondii* is an important opportunistic pathogen in immunocompromised individuals, i.e. patients that suffer from AIDS or are under immunosuppressive therapy. Under such conditions, *T. gondii* can result in life-threatening toxoplasmosis with encephalitis, necrotic lesions within the central nervous system (CNS) or retinochorioiditis (Ambroise-Thomas and Pelloux 1993; Ferreira and Borges 2002). Toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients most often results from reactivation of a persisting *T. gondii* infection due to the severely depressed T-cell-mediated immune response, but can occasionally also result from acute primary infection.

Furthermore, the parasite is of major medical relevance after primary maternal infection during pregnancy, eventually leading to congenital toxoplasmosis. It is the ability to transmigrate through the placenta and to replicate within different foetal tissues without being efficiently hindered by the premature immune system that makes *T. gondii* an important cause of prenatal infections. This can consequently severely injure the foetus, eventually leading to abortion, to considerable pathology at birth or to late sequelae (Ambroise-Thomas and Pelloux 1993).

Importantly, during the acute phase of infection, *T. gondii* can also cross other biological barriers, thereby disseminating into different organs including the brain (Barragan and Sibley 2002, 2003). Although the CNS is certainly not as immunoprivileged as previously thought (Shrikant and Benveniste 1996), colonization of such body sites may nevertheless enhance the parasite’s ability to withstand eradication by the increasingly efficient anti-parasitic immune response of the immunocompetent host. The stress applied by the immune system might drive the parasite to differentiate from the fast-replicating tachyzoite stage to the slow-replicating, tissue cyst-forming and potentially persisting bradyzoite stage (Bohne et al. 1999). This latent parasite stage is well suited to give rise to persistent infections and, furthermore, protects the host from severe damage by parasite-induced cell rupture and immunopathology. Stage differentiation thus represents an important parasite-related feature that allows *T. gondii* to persist within its host for the host’s life span.

The intracellular lifestyle of *T. gondii* largely protects the pathogen against the host’s humoral immune response. Host cell invasion is an active, parasite-driven event that is accomplished within less than 30 s (Sibley and Andrews 2000), thereby dramatically reducing the time of exposure to antibodies or complement. The parasite squeezes through a moving junction formed between the host cell plasma membrane and *T. gondii* (Alexander et al. 2005). This process allows the inclusion of host cell plasma membrane components into the membrane of the nascent parasitophorous vacuole (PV) where the parasite resides in (Lingelbach and Joiner 1998). Importantly, however, host cell transmembrane proteins are selectively excluded from the PV membrane (PVM), whereas glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored proteins are readily included (Mordue et al. 1999). This leads to the formation of a fusion-incompetent vacuole which resists typical phagosome–lysosome fusion and which does not acidify, thus being a safe harbor for the parasite within its host cell (Jones and Hirsch 1972; Sibley et al. 1985; Joiner et al. 1990). The PVM also acts as a molecular sieve, which allows molecules up to 1,300–1,900 Da to freely diffuse across the membrane (Schwab et al. 1994). *T. gondii* extensively modifies the PV and inserts parasite-derived proteins into the PVM (Beckers et al. 1994; Lingelbach and Joiner 1998) presumably in order to gain nutrients from the host cell and also to manipulate the host cell’s physiology. Recently, distinct proteins have been shown to be even translocated into the host cell cytoplasm by unknown mechanisms (Gubbels et al. 2005), and such molecules are also prime candidates for the manipulation of the host cell.

## The immune response against *T. gondii*

In the immunocompetent host, infection with *T. gondii* is predominantly controlled by cell-mediated immunity (reviewed in Denkers and Gazzinelli 1998), although antibodies may also be involved (Kang et al. 2000; Sayles et al. 2000). Appropriately activated T lymphocytes are crucial for the control of both the acute and chronic phase of toxoplasmosis (Fig. 1; Suzuki and Remington 1988; Gazzinelli et al. 1991, 1992). Specifically, CD8+ T cells play a major role as effector lymphocytes against *T. gondii* (Suzuki and Remington 1988), whereas CD4+ T cells are crucial for the regulation of the immune response against *T. gondii* (Gazzinelli et al. 1991, 1992). Macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells are the first line of defence against the parasite during the early phase of infection (Sher et al. 1993; Gazzinelli et al. 1993). Interleukin (IL)-12 is crucial for the induction of an efficient immune response to *T. gondii*, which results in differentiation and clonal expansion of Th1-type T cells and which is produced by macrophages, neutrophils and especially by dendritic cells (DCs) (Fig. 1; Gazzinelli et al. 1994; Reis e Sousa et al. 1997; Bliss et al. 1999). During the effector phase of the immune response, however, interferon (IFN)-γ is mainly involved in the control of a *T. gondii* infection (Suzuki et al. 1988). It activates both haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic effector cells to restrict intracellular parasite replication or even to kill intracellular *T. gondii* (Yap and Sher 1999).

Depending on the host species and the cell type under investigation, the formation of reactive oxygen and nitric oxide (NO) metabolites or the induction of tryptophan starvation may fulfil important anti-parasitic effects induced by IFN-γ (Fig. 1; Adams et al. 1990; Murray et al. 1979; Däubener et al. 1996). Recently, p47 GTPases have been shown to also mediate IFN-γ-regulated resistance against *T. gondii* (Martens et al. 2005; Butcher et al. 2005b). Interestingly, such anti-parasitic activity appears to be accomplished by accumulation of certain p47 GTPase family members at *T. gondii*-containing vacuoles and consecutive disruption of the PVM and the parasite (Martens et al. 2005). In addition to IFN-γ, other pro-inflammatory cytokines, e.g. tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-6 and IL-1, have synergistic effects on the induction of an adequate immune response against *T. gondii* (Sibley et al. 1991; Langermans et al. 1992; Chao et al. 1994; Halonen et al. 1998).

Modulation of cytokine secretion following *T. gondii* infection

*Toxoplasma gondii* triggers the secretion of both pro-inflammatory (e.g. IFN-γ, IL-12, TNF-α) and anti-inflammatory cytokines [e.g. transforming growth factor (TGF)-β, IL-10] after infection (Gazzinelli et al. 1996a). An adequate balance between these antagonizing immunoregulators appears to be decisive for the outcome of infection (Gazzinelli et al. 1996b; Suzuki et al. 2000a,b; Gavrilescu and Denkers 2001; Mordue et al. 2001). During acute toxoplasmosis, IL-10 fulfils a dual role in the suppression of the host’s cellular immune response as observed in both humans and in mice (Table 1). First, it inhibits the IFN-γ production and possibly the proliferation of T lymphocytes, i.e. antagonizes the development of a potentially protective Th1 immune response (Khan et al. 1995; Ellis Neyer et al. 1997). Importantly, such T-cell-dependent immunosuppression exerted by IL-10 primarily appears to avoid overwhelming inflammation which eventually leads to the host’s death (Gazzinelli et al. 1996b; Ellis Neyer et al. 1997). Second, IL-10 may also deactivate macrophages, thereby diminishing IFN-γ-induced toxoplasmacidal activity and facilitating intracellular parasite survival (Bogdan and Nathan 1993; Ellis Neyer et al. 1997). These results provide clear evidence that IL-10-induced immunosuppression following infection with *T. gondii* is beneficial for both the parasite and the host and favours a stable parasite–host relationship. In addition to IL-10, TGF-β is an important deactivator of macrophages (Langermans et al. 2001), the

production of which is triggered after infection with *T.*  
gondii (Table 1; Bermudez et al. 1993). It also inhibits the  
production of IFN-γ by NK cells (Hunter et al. 1995) and  
may thus downregulate regulatory and effector functions of  
anti-Toxoplasma cellular immunity during acute toxoplas-  
mosis (Table 1).

Infection of mice with *T.* gondii induces the secretion of  
IFN-α/β, i.e. type I interferons (Diez et al. 1989) which are  
prominently involved in resistance against viral infections.  
IFN-α and IFN-β are predominantly produced by leuco-  
cytes and fibroblasts, respectively, although other cell types  
may also contribute. The increased amounts of IFN-α/β in  
sera from *T.* gondii-infected mice correlate with a reduced  
IFN-γ production and proliferation of splenocytes (Table 1;  
Diez et al. 1989). This suggests that the production of  
IFN-α/β induced by *T.* gondii during acute infection is  
associated with parasite-induced immunosuppression.

*T.* gondii does, however, not only interfere with the  
host's immune response by inducing the expression and  
secretion of anti-inflammatory cytokines but concomitantly  
blocks the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines  
(Table 1). Infection of resident mouse peritoneal macro-  
phages or immature DCs with viable *T.* gondii does not  
elicit the production of IL-12 and TNF-α in vitro (Reis e  
Sousa et al. 1997; Butcher et al. 2001; McKee et al. 2004).  
Importantly, parasite-infected macrophages and DCs fail to  
produce TNF-α and delay IL-12 secretion even after  
activation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting an  
active interference of intracellular *T.* gondii with their host  
cells (Butcher et al. 2001; McKee et al. 2004). In contrast,  
macrophages and DCs which have been pre-activated and  
are then exposed to soluble parasite extracts are able to  
release IL-12 and TNF-α (Reis e Sousa et al. 1997), and  
this explains the production of these pro-inflammatory  
cytokines in vivo (Gazzinelli et al. 1993). Whereas the  
secretion of IL-12 and TNF-α triggered by dying parasites  
or soluble antigens may thus suffice to induce a cell-  
mediated immune response that partially restricts parasite  
tissue burdens, its blockade by viable intracellular parasites  
may nevertheless allow parasite survival within the host  
and establishment of persistent infections.

### Mechanisms of *T.* gondii to inhibit pro-inflammatory  
cytokine secretion

Both direct and indirect mechanisms have been described  
which may participate in the parasite-imposed inhibition of  
pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion. Anti-inflammatory  
IL-10 (see above) decreases the production of pro-inflam-  
matory cytokines including IL-12 and TNF-α as deter-  
mined after infection of mice with a targeted deletion in the  
IL-10 gene (Gazzinelli et al. 1996b; Ellis Neyer et al.

involved in the ability of NF-κB to translocate to the nucleus (Shapira et al. 2005). Consequently, macrophages are impaired in their ability to produce IL-12 and TNF-α in response to *T. gondii* and even do not upregulate these pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to LPS (Table 1; Butcher et al. 2001). Although this evasion strategy is well established in *T. gondii*-infected murine macrophages, it is still a matter of debate whether it also operates in murine fibroblasts (Shapira et al. 2002; Molestina et al. 2003), possibly indicating a cell-type-specific interference with signaling cascades. The blockade of nuclear translocation of NF-κB in macrophages wanes within 24 h of infection, resulting in LPS-induced IL-12 production in vitro (Butcher and Denkers 2002). Importantly, this also corresponds with the observation that several days after infection of mice with *T. gondii*, NF-κB is able to translocate into the nucleus and to bind to DNA consensus sequences (Shapira et al. 2002). Importantly, however, despite the nuclear translocation of NF-κB during later time points of intracellular parasitism, the LPS-triggered production of TNF-α is still abrogated (Butcher and Denkers 2002). This indicates that *T. gondii* possesses additional—not yet characterized—mechanisms to inhibit the production of certain pro-inflammatory cytokines which—in synergy with IFN-γ—exerts anti-parasitic activity (Sibley et al. 1991).

Recently, the phosphorylation of STAT-3 shortly after parasitic infection has been described as an additional mechanism that leads to defective production of IL-12 and TNF-α in LPS-triggered macrophages (Table 1; Butcher et al. 2005a). STAT-3 transduces binding of IL-10 to its receptor and translocates—following phosphorylation and dimerization—into the nucleus, where it regulates transcription of IL-10-responsive genes including those suppressing IL-12 and TNF-α production. Importantly, the activation of STAT-3 in response to *T. gondii* infection and the consecutive suppression of LPS-triggered TNF-α and IL-12 expression also occur in IL-10-deficient mice (Butcher et al. 2005a). The crucial role of STAT-3 in such suppression was confirmed by the fact that parasite-induced interference with TNF-α and IL-12 expression is diminished in STAT-3-deficient macrophages (Butcher et al. 2005a). Together, these results clearly indicate that *T. gondii* hijacks signaling pathways of infected macrophages to evade potentially effective anti-parasitic immune responses. Whether this mechanism is linked to the transient defect in nuclear translocation of NF-κB remains to be elucidated.

(reviewed by Jones 1997; Trombetta and Mellman 2005). Whereas MHC class I molecules present peptides that predominantly derive from antigens synthesized within the cytosol of a cell (e.g. viral proteins), MHC class II molecules present those which mainly derive from endosomes or phagosomes (e.g. extracellular pathogens or proteins). Furthermore, MHC class I-bound or class II-bound peptides activate CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes, respectively. MHC class I molecules are constitutively expressed in most cell types and can be upregulated by the stimulation with IFN-γ (Ting and Baldwin 1993). In contrast, MHC class II molecules are constitutively expressed only on distinct professional antigen-presenting cells; however, their expression can be induced in a number of cell types upon stimulation with IFN-γ.

Since *T. gondii*-specific immunity largely relies on the adaptive cellular immune response, MHC-restricted antigen presentation of parasite-derived peptides is crucial for the control of the parasite. Due to its intravacuolar localization, presentation via the MHC class II pathway may be of particular relevance, although alternative presentation pathways are thought to also exist (Lüder and Seeber 2001). However, *T. gondii* interferes with the IFN-γ-induced MHC class I and MHC class II expression on the cell surface of bone-marrow-derived murine macrophages (Table 1; Lüder et al. 1998, 2001). In contrast, constitutive production of MHC class I molecules is not altered in the presence of the parasite (Lüder et al. 1998). The parasite also abrogates de novo protein biosynthesis of MHC class II molecules in IFN-γ pre-activated macrophages, thus indicating that the parasite is able to reverse the maturation of infected bone-marrow-derived macrophages (Lüder et al. 1998). Furthermore, activation-induced MHC class II expression is blocked in a variety of other cell types including primary murine peritoneal macrophages, the murine monocyte/macrophage cell line RAW264.7, the murine fibroblast cell line NIH/3T3, the murine B cell line A20 (C. Lang, Ö. Dirik and C.G.K. Lüder, unpublished data), as well as in primary rat astrocytes and microglia and human-derived glioma cells (Lüder et al. 2003a). This indicates that the inhibition of MHC class II expression by *T. gondii* is a general phenomenon and is not restricted to certain cell types or host species. In agreement with this, McKee et al. (2004) showed recently that immature DCs do not upregulate MHC class II molecules in response to viable *T. gondii*, whereas activation readily occurs in response to dead parasites or parasite extracts. In addition, viable *T. gondii* also render immature DCs resistant to LPS-induced upregulation of class II molecules (McKee et al. 2004). DCs are of prime importance in the recognition of pathogens never encountered before and in the consecutive initiation of an adaptive immune response (Banchereau and Steinman 1998; Mellman et al. 1998). They express pattern

Interference of *T. gondii* with expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules are proteins dedicated to present antigenic peptides to T cells

recognition receptors which enable them to recognize distinct pathogen-associated molecular motifs, and ligation of such receptors results in their maturation including the upregulation of MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules (Watts and Amigorena 2000; Medzhitov and Janeway 2000). Therefore, unresponsiveness of immature DCs to viable *T. gondii* or even active parasitic interference with the maturation of DCs may inhibit or at least delay initial expansion of antigen-specific T-helper lymphocytes. In contrast to immature DCs, MHC class II expression by those which matured already prior to encountering the parasite appears to remain unaffected by infection with *T. gondii* (McKee et al. 2004). It has to be stressed, however, that the half-life of MHC class II molecules in antigen-presenting cells, although depending on the antigenic peptides bound, may be well beyond 20 h (Nelson et al. 1994). Since prolonged infection times have not yet been investigated, it is thus also possible that *T. gondii* is also able to downregulate activation-induced MHC class II expression in mature DCs after extended infection periods. Consistent with this view, we did not observe a considerable reduction in the expression of MHC class II molecules in mature murine macrophages until 30 h post infection (Lüder et al. 1998). Taken together, these results establish that *T. gondii* blocks activation-induced MHC class II upregulation in a variety of haematopoietic and non-haematopoietic cell types and also reverses class II expression at least on mature murine macrophages.

Importantly, the diminished MHC class II expression by antigen-presenting cells is of functional significance since CD4+ T-cell clones are poorly activated by infected macrophages treated with IFN-γ as compared with non-infected control macrophages (Lüder et al. 2001). In addition, *T. gondii*-infected immature DCs are inefficient activators of naïve CD4+ splenocytes irrespective of whether DCs have been activated with LPS or not (McKee et al. 2004). The parasite-imposed blockade in the expression of MHC class II molecules may thus delay or diminish the expansion of CD4+ T cells after infection with *T. gondii*. It may also downregulate T-cell help for infected host cells to exert anti-parasitic effector mechanisms. During acute toxoplasmosis, CD4+ T cells are indeed less efficiently expanded as compared with CD8+ T cells (Luft et al. 1984; Sklenar et al. 1986). Furthermore, such evasion of CD4+ T-cell immunity may also explain the fact that following infection of mice with *T. gondii*, T-helper lymphocytes are less effective in restricting parasite propagation than CD8+ T cells (Suzuki and Remington 1988).

Increasing evidence suggests that the inhibition of MHC class II expression by *T. gondii* is achieved by direct interference of intracellular parasites with those events leading to MHC class II expression. First, IFN-γ-induced upregulation of MHC class II is preferentially blocked in parasite-positive macrophages, although a minor effect on uninfected bystander cells was also recognized (Lüder et al. 1998). Second, the interference of *T. gondii* with IFN-γ-induced MHC class II expression occurs independently of a parasite-induced production of the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β or of macrophage-deactivating prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) or NO (Lüder et al. 1998). Furthermore, the involvement of type I interferons, i.e. IFNα/β, can also largely be excluded (C. Lang and C.G.K. Lüder, unpublished data). Therefore, efforts have been undertaken to track the pathway which links IFN-γ receptor ligation and MHC class II expression including the JAK/STAT signaling cascade (Darnell 1997). However, *T. gondii* inhibits neither the expression of the IFN-γ receptor nor the phosphorylation of STAT1α (Lüder et al. 2001). Furthermore, recent results using cells which express either wild-type STAT1 or a GFP-tagged version of the transcription factor indicate that blockade of MHC class II expression does not rely on a disrupted transport of STAT1 from the cytosol into the nucleus after activation with IFN-γ (Lang et al. 2006) as initially hypothesized (Lüder et al. 2001). The transcript levels of the IFN-γ-responsive genes interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-1 and class II trans-activator (CIITA) are nevertheless reduced in infected primary murine bone-marrow-derived macrophages. Interestingly, this goes along with a reduced binding activity of Stat1α to its DNA consensus sequence, i.e. the gamma activated site (GAS). Furthermore, the IFN-γ-induced activity of different GAS-dependent promoters is clearly diminished after infection with *T. gondii* (Lang et al. 2006). Together, these results suggest that *T. gondii* interferes with the IFN-γ-dependent MHC class II expression by disturbing the appropriate binding of activated STAT1 to its consensus sequence or by interference with the assembly or activity of the basal transcriptional machinery at the IRF-1 and CIITA promoters (Table 1). The exact mechanism of *T. gondii*-mediated inhibition of IFN-γ-induced gene expression thus awaits future clarification.

Evasion of IFN-γ-triggered anti-parasitic effector mechanisms by *T. gondii*

Interferon gamma is a highly pleiotropic cytokine and is known to regulate more than 200 genes both related and unrelated to immune functions (Boehm et al. 1997). The fact that *T. gondii* inhibits MHC class II expression by reducing the IFN-γ-triggered mRNA levels of CIITA and IRF-1 and also inhibits IFN-γ-induced MHC class I expression suggested that the parasite might also alter the expression or repression of other IFN-γ-regulated genes. Determination of the mRNA levels of several IFN-γ-
responsive genes by semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) indeed confirmed that infection of murine macrophages with *T. gondii* reduces the expression of a variety of IFN-γ-responsive genes (Fig. 2a). However, we also recognized that the mRNA levels of some IFN-γ-triggered genes were not considerably altered after infection with *T. gondii* (Fig. 2b) or were even enhanced after parasitic infection (Fig. 2c). This indicates that the parasite counterbalances transcription of a variety, but not all, IFN-γ-regulated genes. Such differential effects may be explained by (1) the occurrence of STAT1-independent transcription of some IFN-γ-regulated genes (Ramana et al. 2001) which might not be targeted by the parasite, (2) parasite-imposed modulation of the activity of co-activators which are required to activate or repress some, but not all, IFN-γ-responsive promoters (Shuai 2000) and (3) modulation of the transcription of certain genes after parasitic infection which occurs independently of an activation with IFN-γ and which might overcome *T. gondii*-mediated inhibition of the IFN-γ-induced gene expression (see Fig. 2c). The results, nevertheless, suggest that *T. gondii* broadly counteracts the transcriptional activity triggered by IFN-γ. Since this cytokine is the major mediator of resistance against *T. gondii* (Suzuki et al. 1988), inhibition of its transcriptional activity by intracellular parasites may be crucial for the parasite’s ability to survive intracellularly and to establish persistent infection.

The production of NO by activated murine macrophages restricts growth and replication of intracellular pathogens including *T. gondii* (Adams et al. 1990; Yap and Sher 1999). NO production largely depends on the expression of the inducible NO synthase (iNOS) that can be induced in murine macrophages by IFN-γ, LPS or IFN-γ in combination with LPS or TNF-α (Ding et al. 1988; Drapier et al. 1988). However, as it might be expected from the results discussed above, *T. gondii* is able to inhibit NO production in murine macrophages which have been activated with

IFN-γ, LPS or IFN-γ plus LPS (Table 1; Seabra et al. 2002; Lüder et al. 2003b). Such interference is accompanied by reduced mRNA and protein levels of iNOS, indicating that *T. gondii* interferes with NO production at the transcriptional level (Lüder et al. 2003b). It is particularly evident in parasite-positive macrophages, thereby suggesting a direct interference of viable intracellular parasites with those transduction pathways regulating iNOS expression. Since the iNOS promoter contains STAT1 and NF-κB binding sites, it is hypothesized that parasitic interference occurs via those mechanisms as described above for the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines and MHC class II expression, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. Inhibition of iNOS expression occurs in cells infected with either virulent (Seabra et al. 2002) or avirulent strains of *T. gondii* (Lüder et al. 2003b; Rozenfeld et al. 2003) and thus appears to be a general characteristic of intracellular infection with the parasite. Most importantly, the ability to replicate within macrophages that have been activated with IFN-γ or LPS critically depends on the parasite-imposed inhibition of iNOS expression, thus highlighting the functional importance of this evasion strategy for the development of *T. gondii* (Lüder et al. 2003b). In contrast, intracellular replication is not sustained in macrophages that have been activated by IFN-γ plus LPS. This is despite the fact that NO production in response to the synergistic activation is also partially inhibited by the parasite. However, the level of this inhibition does not suffice to reduce the NO production to those amounts which allow parasite replication (Lüder et al. 2003b). These results establish that *T. gondii* successfully interferes with the IFN-γ or LPS-induced NO production, thereby enabling intracellular replication and eventually dissemination within the host. This is in agreement with findings that iNOS activity is not required for parasite control during the early stage of infection and during inapparent chronic toxoplasmosis (Scharton-Kersten et al. 1997; Schlüter et al. 1999;

Fig. 2 Differential effect of infection of RAW264.7 murine monocytes/macrophages with *T. gondii* on the transcript levels of representative IFN-γ-regulated genes (**a–c**). Cells were infected with *T. gondii* or left uninfected and were stimulated or not with IFN-γ starting 2 h post infection. After 24 h of infection, total RNA was isolated, reverse transcribed and analysed by PCR. Transcript levels of control genes were analysed in parallel (**d**)Suzuki et al. (2000a,b). It has to be stressed, however, that NO production is only partially inhibited after parasitic infection. Residual NO production by activated macrophages may thus help restrict parasite replication and induce differentiation to the potentially persisting bradyzoite stage. The cellular stress imposed by NO on *T. gondii* has indeed been implicated in triggering stage conversion (Bohne et al. 1994) and may thus help to keep a delicate balance between the parasite and its host.

Besides facilitating parasite survival in activated macrophages, the inhibition of NO production by *T. gondii* also protects the host from immunopathological consequences of infection. After oral infection with high doses of *T. gondii*, iNOS-deficient mice indeed survive longer than wild-type mice, and this correlates with decreased inflammation and tissue damage (Khan et al. 1997). The avoidance of the toxic effects of NO after parasitic infection is particularly relevant for the central nervous system. Rozenfeld et al. (2003) described that *T. gondii*-infected astrocytes release PGE2. This leads to a cAMP-dependent secretion of IL-10 by microglia, thereby inhibiting IFN-γ-mediated NO production in an autocrine fashion (Table 1; Rozenfeld et al. 2003). Importantly, the *T. gondii*-induced PGE2 secretion and microglia modulation significantly sustain neurite outgrowth and may reduce the neurodegenerative effect of NO during an inflammatory response within the CNS. Recently, an increased TGF-β secretion by *T. gondii*-infected microglia and the autocrine inhibition of NO production have also been implicated in the avoidance of NO-mediated neuronal damage during cerebral toxoplasmosis (Rozenfeld et al. 2005). Within the CNS, additional mechanisms may thus operate in the inhibition of NO production in order to fulfil the distinct requirements of this organ during toxoplasmic infection.

In addition to iNOS activity, expression of a family of p47 GTPases has been described as important mediators of mouse resistance to various intracellular pathogens including *T. gondii* (Taylor et al. 2004). Whereas their exact functions are still unknown, they are highly expressed after stimulation of different cell types including macrophages with IFN-γ and localize to subcellular membranes including ER, Golgi and—at least some members of this family—also to the membrane of the parasitophorous vacuole *T. gondii* resides in (Martens et al. 2005). Butcher et al. (2005b) recently showed that infection of macrophages with *T. gondii* abrogates IFN-γ-mediated expression of IGTP, LRG-47 and IRG-47 (Table 1). Although the functional significance of this putative evasion strategy remains to be established, it indicates that *T. gondii* counteracts other anti-parasitic effector mechanisms than NO production. The strategy to broadly target IFN-γ-regulated gene expression may thus simultaneously reduce

different potentially harmful weapons of the host to combat the parasite, thereby allowing parasite survival and persistence within its host.

### Modulation of host cell apoptosis by *T. gondii*

Apoptosis, i.e. programmed cell death, is crucial for the regulation of immune responses either by executing lymphocyte death (Krammer 2000) or by modulating the activity of bystander leucocytes (Savill and Fadock 2000). In addition, it fulfils important roles as innate and adaptive effector mechanisms to combat intracellular pathogens (Williams 1994; Lieberman 2003). Apoptosis can be initiated by binding of death ligands such as FasL or TNF-α to specific cell-surface receptors (death-receptor pathway), or after cells encounter stress signals including growth factor deprivation, infection by intracellular pathogens, irradiation or toxins (mitochondrial pathway), or by targeted secretion of granzymes and perforin by NK cells and cytotoxic T cells to kill target cells (granzyme/perforin pathway; Hengartner 2000; Krammer 2000; Lieberman 2003). These signals are transduced via diverse initiator pathways into a common execution pathway which is characterized by the activation of distinct members of the caspases. These proteases then cleave regulatory and structural target proteins, finally leading to DNA condensation, shrinkage and disintegration of the cell.

As an intracellular parasite, *T. gondii* obviously relies on the sustained viability of its host cell in order to accomplish its further development. Not surprisingly, *T. gondii* considerably modulates apoptosis of host cells, and this may be critical for the course of infection (Lüder and Gross 2005). More interestingly, *T. gondii* exerts opposite effects on the cell death program of the host with both triggering (Khan et al. 1996; Liesenfeld et al. 1997; Hu et al. 1999; Gavrilescu and Denkers 2001; Mordue et al. 2001) and inhibiting apoptosis (Nash et al. 1998; Goebel et al. 1999, 2001; Orlofsky et al. 1999; Channon et al. 2002; Payne et al. 2003). The exact conditions of these opposing effects have not yet been completely resolved, but they include the presence or absence of intracellular parasites (Goebel et al. 1999), the host cell type under investigation, i.e. haematopoietic vs non-haematopoietic cells (Mordue et al. 2001), the parasite virulence (Gavrilescu and Denkers 2001; Mordue et al. 2001; Hisaeda et al. 1997) and the susceptibility of the host (Liesenfeld et al. 1997). Dysregulation of the complex apoptotic program of certain host cell populations during *T. gondii* infection can result in overwhelming pathology and the host’s death (Liesenfeld et al. 1997; Gavrilescu and Denkers 2001; Mordue et al. 2001). In order to sustain parasite survival and persistence as well as to avoid life-threatening pathology in thehost, the diverse effects of *T. gondii* on host cell apoptosis, therefore, need to be tightly controlled.

After infection, the immune response to *T. gondii* is considerably regulated by the level of apoptosis in different leucocyte populations. Khan et al. (1996) established that CD4+ T lymphocytes from acutely infected mice readily undergo apoptosis after ex vivo cultivation (Table 2). Importantly, this is accompanied by CD4+ T-cell unresponsiveness to mitogenic or antigenic stimulation and might, thereby, contribute to the defective immune response to *T. gondii* during acute toxoplasmosis (Strickland and Sayles 1977; Luft et al. 1984). Since T lymphocyte unresponsiveness could be partially reversed by exogenous IL-2 and costimulatory molecules could not be detected (Khan et al. 1996), they possibly die by a mechanism referred to as ‘cell death by neglect’ (Nelson and Willerford 1998), although this still awaits experimental confirmation. Following infection of mice with highly virulent *T. gondii* strains or in mice susceptible to severe toxoplasmosis, apoptosis of different leucocyte populations, including T and B lymphocytes, NK cells, granulocytes and macrophages, is strongly increased (Hisaeda et al. 1997; Gavrilescu and Denkers 2001, 2003; Mordue et al. 2001). Such exaggerated leucocyte apoptosis results in the inability of the host to restrict parasite development and leads to the host’s death (Table 2). It results from an overwhelming inflammatory response after infection and may be mediated by both Fas-/FasL-dependent (Liesenfeld et al. 1997; Gavrilescu and Denkers 2003) and TNF-α-/TNF-R1-dependent mechanisms (Mordue et al. 2001; Gavrilescu and Denkers 2001, 2003). Together, these results show that the level of apoptosis in T cells and possibly other leucocytes is critical for the course of toxoplasmosis. Whereas moderate T-cell apoptosis may contribute to a homeostatic regulation of the immune response to *T. gondii*, thereby favouring a stable parasite–host interaction, increased leucocyte apoptosis under conditions of strong inflammation abolishes the anti-parasitic immune response, thereby leading to fatal

toxoplasmosis. It also emphasizes that different pro-apoptotic mechanisms are potentially involved in the regulation of T-cell death during toxoplasmosis. On the one hand, this supports the view of a complex relationship between the parasite and apoptotic processes after infection and, on the other hand, might enable us to specifically target those pathways which regulate pathological cell death, thereby opening new avenues for the treatment of toxoplasmosis.

Besides triggering apoptosis in certain cell populations after infection, *T. gondii* also exerts prominent anti-apoptotic effects. Since apoptotic cell death is an important mechanism of pathogen-infected cells or of cytotoxic T and NK cells to combat intracellular microorganisms, such anti-apoptosis may be a prerequisite for the intracellular lifestyle of *T. gondii*. Infection of a variety of different host cell types either from mice or from humans with *T. gondii* indeed blocks apoptosis induced by diverse pro-apoptotic stimuli (Table 2; Nash et al. 1998; Goebel et al. 1999, 2001; Payne et al. 2003). This includes resistance of infected host cells against irradiation, growth factor deprivation, Fas- and granzyme/perforin-mediated T-cell cytotoxicity and treatment with various toxins, thus indicating that the parasite targets apoptosis that has been induced via the mitochondrial, the death receptor and the granzyme/perforin pathway. Importantly, protection against apoptosis has also been described after infection in mice (Orlofsky et al. 2002) and might thus explain why CTL- and NK-mediated cytotoxicity is not critical for the control of toxoplasmosis (Denkers et al. 1997). The block in apoptosis goes along with a reduced activation of distinct caspases, i.e. those molecules that constitute the central component of apoptotic cascades (Goebel et al. 2001; Payne et al. 2003). Furthermore, following activation of the mitochondrial pathway, the release of cytochrome *c* from mitochondria into the host cell cytosol is clearly diminished in *T. gondii*-infected cells. Since cytosolic cytochrome *c* is crucial for the activation of caspases (Green and Kroemer 2004), its retention within the mitochondria likely fulfils an important

Concomitantly with the retention of cytochrome *c*, the expression of the anti-apoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and Bfl-1/A1 is upregulated after infection with *T. gondii* (Goebel et al. 2001; Molestina et al. 2003), suggesting that a parasite-induced increase in distinct members of the Bcl-2 family prevents the cytochrome *c* release after activation of the mitochondrial pathway. However, additional mechanisms including the upregulation of members of the inhibitors of apoptosis family (IAPs; Molestina et al. 2003), the direct inhibition of cytochrome-*c*-mediated caspase activation (Keller et al. 2006) and the degradation of the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (Goebel et al. 2001) possibly also contribute to the anti-apoptotic effect of *T. gondii*. Further experiments are therefore required to elucidate the importance of these different effects on the inhibition of host cell apoptosis. In addition, the role of NF-κB for the inhibition of apoptosis also deserves further attention. Besides regulating the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines, it also induces the transcription of genes encoding for anti-apoptotic molecules. Payne et al. (2003) reported a requirement of NF-κB for the *T. gondii*-mediated inhibition of apoptosis in murine fibroblasts, whereas we observed that the inhibition of apoptosis after infection of human-derived promyelocytic cells occurred independently of active NF-κB (Lüder and Gross 2005). Furthermore, recent experiments indicate that the inhibition of apoptosis imposed by *T. gondii* does not require de novo transcription by the host cell (D. Hippe and C.G.K. Lüder, unpublished results). The reason for these conflicting results is not yet known. Possible explanations include differences in the mechanisms employed by *T. gondii* to inhibit apoptosis in different host cell types or mechanistic differences depending on the parasite strain; however, this requires experimental confirmation. Taken together, multiple mechanisms appear to be involved in the inhibition of host cell apoptosis by intracellular *T. gondii*. It may be hypothesized that such redundancy helps the parasite to protect its own niche against multiple inducers of apoptosis.

infections within the intermediate hosts. Whereas the list of mechanisms employed by the parasite as discussed herein is certainly not complete, it summarizes recent progress in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms by which the parasite interferes with the host's immune response. The examples provide clear evidence that *T. gondii* at least partially modulates host cell responses by direct interferences with signaling cascades of the host. Such direct interferences are of particular interest since detailed knowledge of their molecular basis will not only give new insights into the parasite–host interaction and the pathogenesis during toxoplasmosis but might also open new possibilities for therapeutic intervention with infection or disease due to *T. gondii*.

Most of the evasion mechanisms employed by *T. gondii* lead to a partial reduction in immune responses rather than to a complete inhibition. The residual level of anti-parasitic immunity is clearly instrumental in partially restricting parasite replication and may also function as an appropriate stress signal to drive the conversion of the fast-replicating tachyzoite stage to the potentially persisting bradyzoite stage. The importance of such partial anti-parasitic immunity is dramatically documented during life-threatening toxoplasmosis in immunocompromised patients. It indicates that *T. gondii* and its host have to keep a critical balance between the host’s immune response and its partial evasion by the parasite, thereby facilitating a long-lasting parasite–host interaction.

Conclusions

Due to the induction of a robust Th1-type cell-mediated immune response after infection of immunocompetent hosts, the importance of immune evasion strategies for the survival of *T. gondii* within its host has long been neglected. During recent years, however, evidence has accumulated that establish parasitic subversion of the host’s immunity as an essential component of the parasitic lifestyle of *T. gondii*. Immune evasion may be particularly relevant for this parasite since transmission to the final host critically depends on its ability to cause long-lasting
