**ABSTRACT**

Endogenous circadian clocks are inherent to all living organisms. They are needed to guarantee successful life since they regulate very important biological processes such as behavior and reproduction. Secretin-like G-protein coupled receptors are very important factors in the signal transduction pathways of circadian clocks. In this review, we will focus on the role of two secretin-like signaling pathways that play an important role in the regulation of the mammalian and the insect clock, respectively: the pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and pigment dispersing factor (PDF) signaling pathways. Both pathways are most likely related although their function in the biological clock differs.

**1. Introduction**

Circadian clocks are ticking in every organism from bacteria to humans, and allow them to anticipate changing environmental conditions that are inherent to the 24h cycle of the earth's rotation around its axis towards the sun. This proper timing of various endogenous rhythms is crucial for every individual to ensure survival and reproduction.

The core genes that regulate the internal clock were first identified in the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* [7] and in the fungus *Neurospora crassa* [24,73]. In 1997, the first mammalian molecular clock gene was discovered based on the similarities with the *Drosophila* clock model [60,24]. Understanding the nature of the circadian system will help to improve quality of life when flying through time zones or working night shifts,

secretin-like Drosophila receptors are orphan receptors, meaning that neither their ligand nor their function is known.

Many more secretin-like receptors are encoded by the human genome. The 20 human secretin-like receptors comprise the receptors for pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), which are involved in the regulation of the mammalian clock.

In this review, we will focus on the role of the mammalian PACAP and the insect pigment dispersing factor (PDF) receptor and their peptide ligands with respect to their involvement in the regulation of the circadian clock.

## 2. The mammalian molecular clock

The mammalian circadian system is organized in a hierarchy of oscillators. At the top of this hierarchy is the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). The SCN is located in the anterior hypothalamus on either side of the third ventricle just above the optic chiasm. It consists of two paired nuclei, each containing about 10,000 neurons. Lesion of the SCN eliminates circadian rhythms and this can be restored by SCN transplants [67,90], suggesting that the SCN can be considered as the main biological master clock. This suggestion is now further supported by studies demonstrating that elimination of the clock genes, a group of transcription factors that are expressed in the SCN, also disrupts the circadian rhythmicity [93].

The clock mechanism in the SCN and the peripheral oscillators are known to be similar at the molecular level [6,79,108,10]. They consist of a network of transcriptional-translational feedback loops that drive rhythmic, ~24-h expression patterns of core clock components [93,70]. These are genes whose protein products are necessary for the generation and regulation of circadian rhythms within the individual cells [102]. The first feedback loop consists of a rhythmic transcription of three period genes (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and two cryptochromes (Cry1 and Cry2) [61,35,63,11,114]. The rhythmic expression of the Pers and the Crys is driven by a complex of BMAL1/CLOCK heterodimers that bind so-called E-box elements in the promoter region of these genes. After transcription/translation, the respective proteins translocate to

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 1 – A network of transcriptional-translational feedback loops constitutes the mammalian circadian clock. In the primary feedback loop, the positive elements are CLOCK and BMAL1. They heterodimerize and initiate transcription of target genes containing E-box cis-regulatory enhancer sequences, including Period (Per1, Per2 and Per3) and Cryptochrome (Cry1 and Cry2). Negative feedback is achieved by PER:CRY heterodimers that translocate back to the nucleus to repress their own transcription. Casein kinase 1 epsilon and delta (CK1ε and CK1δ) are critical factors that regulate the core circadian protein turnover in mammals. The second regulatory loop is induced by CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers activating transcription of retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors, Rev-erba and Rora. REV-ERBα and RORα subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan receptor response elements (ROREs) present in the Bmal1 promoter. RORs activate transcription of Bmal1, whereas REV-ERBs repress the transcription process. Reproduced from Ko and Takahashi [116].
the nucleus, where they inhibit the BMAL1/CLOCK complex and thereby block their own transcription [63,65,85,99,98]. Therefore, this loop is also called the negative feedback loop. PER and CRY proteins are phosphorylated by casein kinase ε (CKIε) which leads to degradation and restarts the cycle [29]. The second loop is a positive loop driven by CLOCK/BMAL1 heterodimers. They activate transcription of the orphan nuclear receptors REV-ERBα and RORα [89,97,105,2]. REV-ERBα and RORα subsequently compete to bind retinoic acid-related orphan nuclear receptors response elements (ROREs) present in the Bmal1 promoter. It has been shown that members of ROR (α, β and γ) and REV-ERBs (α and β) are able to regulate Bmal1 through ROREs [40]. RORs activate transcription of Bmal1, whereas REV-ERBs repress the transcription of Bmal1. Hence, the circadian oscillation of Bmal1 is both positively and negatively regulated by RORs and REV-ERBs. The autoregulatory loops are illustrated in Fig. 1.

A fundamental property of the circadian clock is the ability to generate and sustain an endogenous rhythm of 24 h [42]. This means that the clock needs to be adapted to the external world, since the period length of most biological clocks deviates from the astronomical 24 h day. The SCN can respond to both photic and non-photic stimuli, which seem to be mutually antagonistic. The sum of these stimuli interacts with phase resetting leading to the overall stable entrainment of the clock [14,45]. At the molecular level, evidence indicates that both photic and non-photic entrainment is accomplished via regulation of the two light-sensitive Per genes and Bmal1 [55,70,86,93]. Recent discoveries (see below) indicate that light is transmitted to the clock via the photopigment melanopsin and the classical photoreceptors, the rods and the cones of the retina.

### 3. The role of PACAP and PACAP receptors

#### 3.1. PACAP, a multifunctional and widespread peptide

Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) is a 38-amino acid peptide discovered in 1989 while searching for a new hypothalamic factor. It potently increased the cAMP levels in pituitary cells, a property which gave name to the peptide [77]. Later, PACAP was also found in a truncated form of 27 amino acids, derived from the same precursor, preproPA-CAP [106]. PACAP, together with vasoactive intestinal peptide, belongs to the growth hormone-releasing factor (GRF) superfamily of peptides. All of these peptides exert their functions through activation of a distinct family (Family B or secretin-like receptor family) of 7-transmembrane G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are only distantly related to the “classical” rhodopsin-related group of receptors (Family A) [48]. PACAP and VIP exert their function via three PACAP receptors: the PAC1 receptor which is specific for PACAP and the VPAC1 and VPAC2 receptors which are activated by both PACAP and VIP [49]. Besides the widespread distribution throughout the central and the peripheral nervous system [41], PACAP is also present in non-neuronal cells [106]. Numerous studies have also provided evidence for the involvement of PACAP in a broad range of biological functions: It can act as a neurotransmitter, neuromodulator, neurohormone, hormone, autocrine/paracrine substance, neurotrophic factor and immunomodulator [106].

PACAP may also exert a role in the control of circadian rhythms in the SCN. It is a marker of the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) which can be considered a non-image forming neuronal pathway in mammals. This reaches target areas in the brain involved in circadian timing, masking behavior, the papillary light reflex and the regulation of light-induced melatonin secretion from the pineal gland [44]. The PACAP-containing retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) form a photoreceptive network with their processes covering the entire retina. They express the photopigment melanopsin in their membrane [41], making the RCGs intrinsically photosensitive [52,71]. They project to the SCN. The RGCs also contain glutamate [47] and although it is clear that glutamate released from these neurons is an important mediator of adjustments in circadian timing in response to light [27], there is now evidence that PACAP also plays an important role.

#### 3.2. Role of PACAP signaling

The evidence that PACAP is likely to have a function in mediating daytime light information to the clock is based on both in vivo and in vitro studies and from the studies involving PACAP and PAC1 receptor deficient mice.

The effects of PACAP on the SCN in vitro are concentration-dependent: at low concentrations, PACAP mimics the effects of light [50], whereas higher concentrations appear to encode darkness information [107,43]. In vivo, microinjection of PACAP into the SCN during the middle of the subjective day evoked large but transient phase advances in wheel-running behavior, followed by small, steady-state phase delays. During the early subjective night, PACAP elicited smaller phase delays and late in the subjective night, PACAP had no significant effects [88]. Studies in mice lacking PACAP have shown that these animals have an attenuated light response during the subjective night, supporting a role of PACAP in light entrainment [18,59].

Studies of mutant mice lacking the PAC1 receptor (PAC₁R⁻/⁻ mice) show that this receptor plays a role in modulating the light induced resetting of the behavioral rhythm and light-induced clock gene expression in the SCN [46]. The circadian period of wheel-running activity in PAC₁R⁻/⁻ mice (τ) was shorter compared to wild-type animals. Light pulses given early in the subjective night resulted in larger phase delays in wheel-running behavior in PAC₁R⁻/⁻ mice compared to control mice, accompanied by a reduction in the induction of Per1, Per2 and c-fos gene expression in the SCN to the same levels in both wild-type and PAC₁R⁻/⁻ mice. However, in contrast to the phase advance seen in wild-type mice, PAC₁R⁻/⁻ mice responded with phase delays after photic stimulation. These data indicate that PAC1 receptor signaling participates in the gating control of photic sensitivity of the clock and suggests that Per1, Per2 and c-fos are of less importance for light-induced phase shifts at night.

#### 3.3. PACAP and glutamate: regulation mechanism

Several studies now have demonstrated a role of PACAP as a modulator of glutamate signaling [69,111]: the signaling
pathways involved in light-induced phase shifts are assumed to be initiated by the release of both glutamate and PACAP from RHT terminals in the SCN. The signaling pathway is depicted in Fig. 2.

Phase shifts of the circadian rhythm initiated by glutamate in both early and late night engage specific intracellular programs mediated by NMDA receptor activation and Ca²⁺

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 2 – Signal transduction of photic messages in the mammalian SCN. NMDA-mediated calcium influx activates NOS and CaM kinase activity, which in turn modulates other kinases (such as PKG and MAP kinase signaling) which may lead to phosphorylation of CREB and immediate early genes (c-fos) and/or clock genes containing a CRE-element in the promoter region. PACAP stimulates the PACAP-specific PAC1 receptor and activates several signaling pathways via cAMP/PKA and/or PLC/IP3 signaling pathways. During activation PACAP signaling interacts with glutamate signaling (see text) at different levels and in a clock- and concentration dependent manner, which may either potentiate or attenuate glutamate signaling. Pathways activated by PACAP and glutamate found in other brain tissues but remain to be established in the SCN, are indicated by dash arrows.

influx [22,27,76,78], which activates the production of nitric oxide (NO) [22,75,76,91]. During early night, glutamate-induced delays are dependent on intracellular calcium activation via ryanodine receptor activation [21]. Glutamate-induced phase advance during late night on the other hand involves activated soluble guanylyl cyclase and an increase in the cGMP concentration and activity of cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) [36]. Intermediate coupling of glutamate to light induced gene expression involves the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase (CaMKII) [1,33,82,113] and extracellular signal-related kinase/p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAKP) [84]. Night-time restricted gating of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway by the NMDA receptor is regulated by Dextras1, a Ras-like G-protein [16,30,39]. MAPK stimulation activates the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) [23,34,37,84,83,104] representing convergent elements which in turn regulate CRE-mediated transcription of light responsive genes such as c-fos [25,62] and the clock genes Per1 and Per2 [3,4,32,81,101,104,112,115].

The PACAP-mediated signal-transduction pathways involved in the regulation of the light responsive genes are not so well characterized. PACAP is, however, known to activate the PAC1 receptor and subsequently two different signaling pathways via two different G-proteins (1) the Gαs and the cAMP/PKA pathway and (2) the Gαq, PLC/IP3 pathway, responsible for an increase in intracellular calcium [106]. In the SCN, activation of the cAMP/PKA pathway shows clock-restricted phase shifting properties. For example, during the subjective night, activation of this pathway seems to mimic the effects of PACAP on glutamate-induced phase shifts [15,103] and blocking of the pathway blocks the glutamate induced Per1 gene expression in the SCN during early night, but not during late night [103]. PACAP can also modulate glutamate signaling via Ca²⁺, PKC and ERK signaling by potentiating Ca²⁺ influx via L-type Ca²⁺ channel activity. So, PACAP seems to set a lower concentration threshold for glutamate-induced raise in intracellular calcium [26]. The NMDA receptor is crucial for light-induced phase shifting [27]. The regulation of this receptor via PACAP can either be obtained via Homer-1a [80] or via phosphorylation [111,72] of the glutamate-binding NR2 subunit of the NMDA receptor. The phosphorylation is carried out by Fyn, a nonreceptor protein-tyrosine kinase from the Src kinase family. This process is regulated by scaffolding protein receptor for activated kinase-1 (RACK1), which inhibits Fyn-mediated phosphorylation of NR2 [110]. Homer-1a is a C-terminally truncated form of Homer-1 which binds to metabotropic glutamate receptors type 1 and 5, inositol-trisphosphate receptors, and the shrank/GKAP/PSD-95/NMDA receptor complex, thereby forming a link between NMDA receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors and intracellular calcium signaling, thus participating in activity-dependent control of glutamatergic neurotransmission [109]. The PAC1 receptor may influence NMDA receptor activity by lowering CaM, because binding of CaM to the NMDA receptor is known to inactivate NMDA receptor signaling [28]. Mitogen- and stress-activated protein kinase 1 (MSK1), which is a downstream target for the MAPK signaling pathway [95], was recently also shown to be involved in light-induced signaling in the SCN [13]. After phosphorylation of MSK1 by MAPK, MSK can phosphorylate CREB, which can induce Per1

expression. So, all together, PACAP can stimulate a pathway of ERK/MSK1/CREB/per1. Interestingly, the cAMP/PKA pathway also seems to be able to activate CREB through an MSK-mediated signaling pathway [20] and it is also possible that PACAP couples to MSK1 signaling in the SCN via cAMP activation, but this remains to be proven.

### 4. PACAP in invertebrates

As mentioned before, PACAP is a member of the growth hormone-releasing factor superfamily of peptides. In humans, this superfamily includes nine hormones that are related by structure, distribution, function, and receptors [56,100], namely glucagons (GLUC), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), GLP-2, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), GRF, peptide histidine-methionine (PHM), PACAP, secretin, and VIP. A very recent proposed evolutionary scheme [66] suggests that all GRF peptides evolved from one ancestral glucagon/PACAP gene long before the divergence Protostomians-Deuterostomians, about 650 million years ago. Early in vertebrate evolution, GHRF, PRP-PACAP, and PHI-VIP genes are proposed to have derived from three rounds of genome duplication. However, this scheme and previous published schemes [17], also imply that there should be PACAP-like peptides in invertebrates. However, the only known insect peptides that might be related to the GRF-like peptides are Drosophila amnesiac and members of the adipokinetic (AKH) family.

The adipokinetic hormones display sequence homology to glucagons [17] and the action of AKH in insects is comparable to that of glucagon in mammals. AKH contributes to hemolymph sugar homeostasis and is involved in the mobilization of sugars and lipids from the fat body during energy-requiring activities.

The amnesiac gene was identified in BLAST searches that revealed a limited sequence similarity to PACAP [31]. One of the putative peptides encoded by the precursor gene displays 18% identity with tunicate PACAP-27 and 10% identity with human PACAP-38. It is unclear whether this low degree of similarity is meaningful because the amnesiac peptide has four cysteines suggesting a rather stringent conformation, while none of the PACAP members have any cysteines, and PACAP is the most conserved member of the GRF superfamily [106]. Both peptides however are involved in learning and memory [51]. The functional comparison of PACAP and amnesiac does underline phylogenetically conserved functions across phyla and may provide insights into the possible mechanisms of action and evolution of this neuropeptidergic system. However, no role for amnesiac in the regulation of the Drosophila biological clock has yet been proposed. Interestingly, however, PACAP also seems to activate the recently identified Drosophila pigment dispersing factor receptor [74].

### 5. Drosophila PDF signaling

As mentioned before, many of the genetic components underlying the fundamental circadian pacemaker were discovered in Drosophila. Analogous to the mammalian clock, the

Drosophila clock is also based on two interacting feedback loops [38]: in one loop, transcription of the period and timeless genes is negatively regulated by the Period and Timeless proteins, which inhibit (with a time delay) the activity of the activating transcription factors Clock and Cycle [5,96] (Fig. 3). In the second loop, clock mRNA and protein oscillate (in antiphase to period and timeless) by driving circadian expression of the clock repressor Vrille [9,19]. Clock also controls the expression of PDF (Fig. 3), while Vrille controls the accumulation of PDF. PDF is produced in a subset of per-expressing clock neurons (LNv) that are required for the pacemaker activities of daily activity rhythms [53,8,58]. PDF production remains constant during the day, but it is released rhythmically from the lateral clock neurons, which can explain its rhythmic effect on fly activity. PDF has been proposed to have a similar function in insects as VIP in mammals, mediating the synchrony of individual clock neurons [68,87] since PDF feeds back on the clock neurons themselves. This was shown by loss-of-function PDF mutations and ectopic PDF expression which both cause arrhythmicity and altered periods. Flies with elevated PDF levels have long periods [54], whereas flies lacking PDF exhibit short periods [92]. P-element mediated mutagenesis of the recently identified Drosophila PDF receptor [74,64,57] that resulted in two mutants with deletions in 3'UTR, mimics the phenotype of the $pdf^{01}$ mutants in respect to reduced behavioral rhythmicity and a severe negative geotaxis [74]. The receptor is also expressed in a subset of the clock neurons as well as in cell

![Figure 3](#fig-3)

Fig. 3 – The two regulatory loops in the Drosophila clock: PER and TIM are negative elements and CLK and CYC are positive elements. These elements are also regulated by vri expression. VRI itself controls this loop, since continuous VRI activity suppresses PDF levels, indicating that cycling of VRI is required for wild-type PDF function. The dashed lines indicate that it has not been determined whether VRI regulates per and tim expression independently of PDF (1) or via PDF (2). Activating and inhibiting functions are indicated by arrows and blocked lines, respectively. PER, PERIOD; TIM, Timeless; CLK, Clock; CYC, Cycle; VRI, Vrille; PDF, Pigment dispersing factor.

bodies in the lateral and dorsal protocerebrum and the  
subesophageal ganglion, areas that have been described  
previously to harbor the relay areas between the fly's master  
clock and rhythmic behavior. Sequence homology also  
showed that the PDF receptor is very closely related to the  
calcitonin and the VIP receptor (VPAC2) receptor.  

In conclusion, we can say that at this moment it is unclear  
which insect peptide is the true homolog of the mammalian  
PACAP and VIP peptides. Most likely and based on functional  
studies, Drosophila amnesiac is the functional homolog of  
vertebrate PACAP and Drosophila PDF the one of VIP. However,  
in that case, not all functions of all peptides are revealed and  
future research is certainly needed. More importantly, the  
secretin-like receptors involved in circadian rhythms are  
probably the result of gene duplication events occurring in  
tandem with increasing organismal complexity during evolution.  
The putative ancestral receptors might be more like the  
deuterostome CAL/CGRP and CRF receptors. This is in  
agreement with BLASTP results of the Drosophila PDF receptor  
against the human genome database. However, their involvement in circadian rhythms seems to be conserved.
