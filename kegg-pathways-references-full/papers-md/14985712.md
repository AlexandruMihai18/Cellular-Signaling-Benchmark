Notch regulation of lymphocyte development and function

Freddy Radtke, Anne Wilson, Stephane JC Mancini & H Robson MacDonald

Notch proteins regulate a broad spectrum of cell fate decisions and differentiation processes during fetal and postnatal development. Mammals have four Notch receptors that bind five different ligands. The function of Notch signaling during lymphopoiesis and T cell neoplasia, based on gain-of-function and conditional loss-of-function approaches for the Notch1 receptor, indicates Notch1 is essential in T cell lineage commitment. Recent studies have addressed the involvement of other Notch receptors and ligands as well as their downstream targets, demonstrating additional functions of Notch signaling in embryonic hematopoiesis, intrathymic T cell development, B cell development and peripheral T cell function.

In 1917 Thomas Hunt Morgan and colleagues described a strain of *Drosophila melanogaster* with notches at the ends of their wing blades<sup>1</sup>. This particular phenotype is the result of a partial loss of function (haploinsufficiency) of what was later identified as *Notch*<sup>2,3</sup>. Notch encodes an evolutionarily conserved transmembrane receptor activated by two distinct (and equally conserved) cell surface ligands called Delta and Serrate. Mammals have four receptors (Notch1–Notch4) and five ligands: Jagged1 and Jagged2 (homologs of Serrate) and Delta1, Delta3 and Delta4 (homologs of Delta; Fig. 1a), which are expressed on many cell types. Notch signaling is involved in many differentiation processes and lineage decisions in fetal and postnatal development, as well as in adult self-renewing organs (reviewed in ref. 4). Stem cell maintenance, binary cell fate decisions and initiation of differentiation are among the many key functions controlled by Notch (reviewed in ref. 5).

Notch signaling is initiated through ligand-receptor interactions, leading to proteolytic cleavage of the receptor, a process that liberates the cytoplasmic domain of Notch (NIC). NIC translocates to the nucleus and heterodimerizes with the transcription factor CSL (CBF-1 for humans, Suppressor of hairless for drosophila and Lag for *Caenorhabditis elegans*; also known as RBP-J in the mouse), converting it from a repressor into an activator (Fig. 1b). Target genes of Notch signaling include basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors of the Hairy enhancer of split (Hes) family such as *Hes1* and *Hes5* (ref. 6) and the related *Herp* (Hes-related repressor protein) transcription factor family<sup>7</sup>, as well as the cell cycle regulator *Cdkn1a*<sup>8</sup>. *Nrarp*<sup>9</sup> (Notch-regulated ankyrin-repeat protein), *Deltex1* (ref. 10) and *Ptcra* (pre-T-α)<sup>11</sup> have also been reported as Notch target genes.

Several modulators acting at extracellular, cytoplasmic and nuclear levels regulate Notch signaling. For example, fucose can be attached to serine and threonine residues within the epithelial growth factor (EGF) domain of Notch receptors by the protein O-fucosyltransferase<sup>12</sup>. O-fucose, which is apparently required for efficient binding of Notch receptors to their ligands<sup>13</sup>, can be further modified by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine mediated by a family of glycosyltransferases called Fringe proteins<sup>14,15</sup>. This additional glycosylation event restricts activation of Notch signaling to Delta ligands, whereas Jagged-mediated Notch signaling is inhibited (Fig. 1b). Deltex1 and Numb proteins are cytoplasmic regulators of Notch signaling. In drosophila, Deltex is described as a positive regulator of Notch signaling<sup>16</sup>, and Numb, as a negative regulator that suppresses Notch activity, possibly by preventing nuclear translocation of NIC<sup>17</sup>. Nrarp and Mint ((Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein) regulate Notch signaling within the nucleus. Nrarp, which contains two ankyrin repeats that interact with NIC and CSL, is induced at the transcriptional level by expression of NIC. Overexpression of Nrarp in bone marrow progenitors inhibits Notch1 signaling<sup>18</sup>. The mouse Mint protein and its human homolog SHARP were both identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen for CSL-interacting proteins<sup>19,20</sup>. Mint competes with NIC for binding to CSL and thereby negatively regulates Notch signaling<sup>19</sup> (Fig. 1b).

### Notch and lymphocytic leukemia

The first mammalian homolog of drosophila *Notch* was identified in humans suffering from T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia. A chromosomal translocation, t(7;9)(q34;q34.3), that juxtaposes the C-terminal region of EGF repeat 34 of human *NOTCH1* to the T cell receptor-β (*TCRB*) locus was identified<sup>21</sup> and leads to the aberrant expression of a truncated Notch1-IC protein called TAN1 (for translocation-associated Notch homolog)<sup>22</sup>. Mice reconstituted with hematopoietic progenitor cells expressing TAN1 proteins develop T cell leukemias, confirming the causative nature of this protein in disease development<sup>23</sup>. These initial observations and conclusions were confirmed by reports showing that expression of dominant active forms of Notch receptors in hematopoietic progenitor cells or in immature thymocytes induces development of T cell leukemias<sup>10,23–25</sup>. Furthermore, constitutive expression of Delta4

Figure 1 Notch receptors and signaling.

(a) Notch receptor and ligands. The drosophila genome encodes one Notch receptor (dNotch), whereas the mammalian genome encodes four (Notch1–Notch4). The extracellular domains contain EGF-like repeats (36 in dNotch, Notch1 and Notch2; 34 in Notch3; 29 in Notch4) associated with ligand binding and three cysteine-rich Notch/LIN12 repeats (LIN) that prevent ligand-independent signaling. The cytoplasmic portion contains two protein-protein interaction domains, the RAM domain (R), six ankyrin (ANK) repeats, two nuclear localization signals (NLS), a transactivation domain (TAD, absent from Notch3 and Notch4) and a PEST sequence (P). dNotch can be activated by two transmembrane-bound ligands, Serrate and Delta, whereas the mammalian Notch receptors (Notch1–Notch4) are activated by five ligands (Jagged1 and Jagged2, homologs of Serrate; and Delta1, Delta3 and Delta4, homologs of Delta). The common structural feature of Notch ligands is an N-terminal domain, DSL (Delta, Serrate and Lag). Recently, an unconventional Notch ligand (GPI-linked neural cell adhesion molecule F3, or contactin) was identified that activates Notch through Deltex1 (ref. 94). A cysteine-rich (CR) domain is located downstream of the EGF-like repeats in Serrate, Jagged1 and Jagged2. PM, plasma membrane.

(b) Notch signaling. A single precursor protein of Notch receptors is cleaved in the Golgi by a furin-like convertase, transported to the cell surface and expressed as an heterodimer. Ligand binding initiates two proteolytic cleavages (red 'lightning'). The first, mediated by the ADAM protease TACE (tumor-necrosis factor α-converting enzyme), occurs near the transmembrane domain. The cleaved subunit is 'trans-endocytosed' by the neighboring ligand-expressing cell<sup>95</sup>. The second occurs within the transmembrane domain and is mediated by γ-secretase activity of presenelin (PS). The liberated cytoplasmic domain (NIC) translocates to the nucleus and binds to the transcription factor CSL, converting it from a transcriptional repressor into a transcriptional activator by displacing a corepressor complex (CoR)<sup>96,97</sup> and recruiting coactivators (CoA)<sup>98–100</sup>. Fringe (a fucose-specific β-1.3 N-acetylglucosamintransferase that elongates O-linked fucose residues attached to EGFs within the Golgi during transport to the cell surface) inhibits Jagged1-mediated Notch1 signaling and potentiates Delta-mediated signaling. Although Deltex has been described as a positive regulator in drosophila<sup>16</sup>, Deltex and Numb negatively modify Notch signaling within the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Mint is also a negative modulator of Notch signaling, as it competes with NIC for binding to CSL.

in bone marrow progenitors leads to fatal lymphoproliferative diseases<sup>26</sup> or to the induction of T cell leukemia<sup>27</sup>. Thus, T cell malignancies can also be induced by aberrant expression of Notch ligands. Overexpression of NIC in hematopoietic cells gives rise exclusively to T cell neoplasia. No tumors of myeloid origin have been described so far, indicating that NIC must cooperate with T cell-specific signals to exert its oncogenic potential. This has been confirmed by transplantation of NIC-expressing bone marrow progenitors derived from mice deficient in recombination activation gene 2 (Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>) or lymphocyte cytosolic protein 2 (Lcp2<sup>-/-</sup>, or SLP76-deficient), both of which lack pre-TCR signaling, into lethally irradiated mice. These mice did not develop T cell leukemia. However, introduction of a *Tcrb* transgene into Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> mice restored the oncogenic function of NIC, confirming that transformation is dependent on a second signal mediated by the pre-TCR<sup>28</sup>. Similar results were obtained with transgenic mice that express Notch3-IC in the thymus<sup>29</sup>. Aberrant Notch signaling is necessary not only for the initiation of tumors but also for tumor maintenance<sup>30</sup>. T cell neoplasias are also caused by proviral integration of the Moloney murine leukemia virus or the feline leukemia virus into *Notch1* or *Notch2*, respectively<sup>31–33</sup>. In both cases, expression of the cytoplasmic domain of the corresponding Notch receptor is under viral control.

The molecular mechanisms by which aberrant Notch signaling causes T cell leukemias are not fully understood. Experimentally, Notch1 can collaborate with c-Myc<sup>31</sup>, E2A-PBX1 (ref. 34) and Ikaros<sup>35</sup>, whereas Notch3 downregulates tumor suppressive E2A activity<sup>36</sup> to induce T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Expression of Notch receptors and ligands has also been reported in Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer derived from germinal center B cells, and in T cell-derived anaplastic large cell lymphoma<sup>37</sup>. Involvement of Notch2 has been suggested in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia<sup>38</sup>. Whether Notch signaling is important in these types of lymphocytic leukemias remains to be shown.

### Notch and hematopoietic stem cells

Notch receptors and ligands are widely expressed in the hematopoietic system (Fig. 2), indicating an important function for Notch signaling in hematopoiesis. In the mouse, the first identifiable hematopoietic cells (referred to as primitive hematopoiesis) are found within the extraembryonic yolk sac around embryonic day 7.5 (E7.5). During embryonic development, the site of hematopoiesis shifts from the extraembryonic to intraembryonic tissues, as hematopoietic precursor cells are later found in the para-aortic splanchnopleura between days E8.5 and E10 of gestation and in the aorta-gonad-mesonephros from days E10.5 to E12. Long-term repopulating hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) with the capacity to reconstitute the entire hematopoietic compartment of an adult mouse can be isolated from the aorta-gonad-mesonephros region. At later stages of development, the site of hematopoiesis shifts again, first to the fetal liver and finally to the adult bone marrow^{39}.

Hematopoiesis and vasculogenesis are closely linked during embryonic development. Several reports support the existence of a bipotential hemangioblast that gives rise to both endothelial and hematopoietic cells^{40,41}. More recently, hematopoietic stem cells were shown to originate by budding from the endothelial cell layer in the murine midgestation dorsal aorta^{42}. Notch1 and Notch4, but not Notch2, are expressed in cells that can be classified as hemangioblasts, whereas the first hematopoietic progenitors express Notch1 and 2, but not Notch4. Primitive hematopoiesis in the yolk sac occurs independently of Notch1. However, para-aortic splanchnopleura-derived cells of Notch1-deficient origin lose the capacity to reconstitute newborn recipients. Furthermore, blocking of Notch signaling by γ-secretase inhibitors suppresses *in vitro* hematopoiesis in para-aortic splanchnopleura explants (E9.5), but not in aorta-gonad-mesonephros explants (E10.5), in which hematopoietic progenitors already exist. In summary, these results strongly indicate that Notch1 signaling is essential for the generation of hematopoietic stem cells derived from endothelial cells but is dispensable for later stages of embryonic hematopoiesis^{43}.

Whether Notch signaling has a similar function during generation of HSCs within the bone marrow compartment is unknown. However, Notch signaling may participate in forming the putative stem cell niche for HSCs^{44}. Osteoblasts produce hematopoietic growth factors and are activated by parathyroid hormone or the parathyroid hormone-related protein. Osteoblast-specific expression of the activated parathyroid hormone-related protein receptor results in increased numbers of Jagged1-expressing osteoblasts, which correlates with increased HSC numbers. Because the increase in HSC numbers was abolished in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors, it has been suggested that Jagged1-expressing osteoblasts regulate HSC homeostasis through Notch activation (Fig. 3).

Involvement of Notch signaling in HSC maintenance is further supported by multiple gain-of-function studies. Expression of a constitutively active form of Notch1 in murine bone marrow progenitors can lead to increased HSC self-renewal^{45} or to the immortalization of progenitor cells capable of undergoing lymphoid and myeloid differentiation both *in vitro* and *in vivo*^{46}. Moreover, coculture of murine or human HSCs with soluble or immobilized Notch ligands, or feeder cells expressing Jagged1, Jagged2, or Delta1, can maintain or even enhance HSC self-renewal^{47–53}, possibly by activating the Notch target gene *Hes1* (ref. 54). Although this large body of gain-of-function experiments suggests involvement of Notch signaling in HSC maintenance and/or self-renewal, conditional loss-of-function approaches for Notch1 (ref. 55), Notch2 (ref. 56), or CSL^{57} have so far failed to support the possibility of a function for Notch signaling in adult HCSs.

Notch receptors are also expressed in the myeloid lineage (Fig. 2), and gain-of-function and *in vitro* coculture studies have linked Notch signaling to myeloid differentiation^{58,59}. Because of space limitations, this topic will not be discussed in this review.

### Notch and T cell development

The essential function of Notch1 in T cell fate specification is the most well-characterized function of a Notch receptor in hematopoiesis^{55,60}.

REVIEW

Figure 3 Notch signaling in lymphopoiesis. Bone marrow (BM) HSCs are maintained through self-renewal in stem cell niches in close contact with stromal and/or other hematopoietic cells. Jagged1 (J1)-Notch1 (N1) interactions may influence the process of self-renewal. After commitment to the lymphoid lineage, early lymphocyte precursors (ELP) continue differentiation into either B or T cells. In the bone marrow, Notch (N) signaling must be 'off' to allow pro-B cells to progress through pre-B I and pre-B II stages to immature B cells (Imm B). After migration to the periphery, interaction of Delta1 (D1) with Notch2 (N2):CSL induces transitional B cells (Trans B) to become MZB cells. In contrast, Mint induces transitional B cells to become FoB cells. In the thymus, the early thymus precursor (ETP) requires a Notch1 (N1):CSL signal to develop into pro-T cells; otherwise, B lineage development occurs by default. This signal is mediated through Delta1. Pro-T cells then require Notch1 signals to efficiently develop into pre-T cells of the αβ lineage and to undergo successful pre-TCR-mediated signaling. It is unclear whether Notch signaling influences γδ T cell development.

Double-positive (DP) thymocytes mature into conventional CD4 or CD8 T cells and then migrate to the periphery, where CD4 T cells undergo further differentiation into Tₕ1 or Tₕ2 cells. This latter lineage split may be influenced by D1:Notch3 (N3) signaling. Regulatory CD25⁺CD4 T cells (CD25⁺Tₘ) develop in the thymus from DP T cells, possibly through N3 signaling.

In the absence of Notch1, bone marrow progenitors enter the thymus and develop into B cells, indicating that Notch1 'instructs' an early lymphoid progenitor to adopt a T versus B cell fate⁶¹. A similar result was obtained more recently through inactivation of CSL, which mediates signaling of all Notch receptors⁵⁷. CSL-deficient bone marrow progenitors fail to develop into T cells in the thymus and consequently develop ectopically into B cells. The indistinguishable phenotypes of Notch1- and CSL-targeted mice indicate that Notch1 signals lymphoid progenitor cells through CSL in a nonredundant way to specify the T cell lineage (Fig. 3) despite the coexpression of other Notch receptors (Fig. 2). This model is consistent with the finding that inducible Notch2 inactivation does not affect T cell development⁵⁶. Furthermore, Notch3-targeted mice develop normally, and so far no hematopoietic phenotypes have been reported⁶².

Reciprocal gain-of-function experiments in which Notch1-IC⁶³ or Delta4 (refs. 26,27) are expressed in bone marrow precursors lead to ectopic T cell development in the bone marrow and a simultaneous block in B cell development. Expression of the Notch target genes *Hes1* or *Hes5* in bone marrow precursors also results in impaired B cell development, indicating that Notch1-IC induced inhibition of B cell development could at least be partially mediated through Hes⁶⁴. Collectively these studies indicate that Notch signaling must be absent or negatively regulated during B cell development in the bone marrow (Fig. 3), despite the fact that Notch receptors and ligands are expressed on bone marrow progenitors and stroma (Fig. 2). This paradox could be explained by the finding that the B lineage commitment factor Pax5 represses transcription of *Notch1* in B cell progenitors. Indeed, forced expression of Pax5 promoted B cell development at the expense of T cell development, whereas all other blood lineages developed normally⁶⁵,⁶⁶. Whether Notch1 signaling has a reciprocal function in T cell progenitors by repressing *Pax5* transcription remains to be investigated.

Fringe⁶⁷, Deltex⁶⁸ and Nrarp¹⁸ negatively modify Notch signaling when overexpressed in bone marrow progenitors or immature thymocytes, consequently blocking T cell development. Unexpectedly, expression of Numb (another putative negative regulator of Notch) in

immature thymocytes has no effect on T cell development⁶⁹. Although most of these modifiers can interfere with Notch1 signaling and T cell development when overexpressed, their physiological function in the hematopoietic compartment remains to be shown.

These data indicate that Notch1 signaling is necessary and sufficient for T cell lineage commitment. However, whether this commitment process occurs before or after migration of precursors to the thymus is still controversial. One study favors an intrathymic Notch-dependent commitment mechanism⁷⁰, because Notch1 activation in fetal lymphoid precursors is found only after their entry into the thymic epithelial microenvironment, where Notch ligands (such as Jagged1, Jagged2, Delta1 and Delta4) are expressed. The expression of multiple Notch ligands on thymic stroma (Fig. 2) raises the question of which triggers the physiological Notch1 signal for T cell lineage commitment. Jagged2 can be excluded because Jagged2-deficient mice show only a minor decrease in γδ T cells, whereas αβ T cell development seems normal⁷¹. Delta1 seems to be the essential Notch1 ligand, as stromal cells expressing Delta1 can induce T cell development of human and mouse hematopoietic progenitors *in vitro*⁷²,⁷³. This view was challenged recently by work showing that conditional inactivation of *Delta1* in hematopoietic cells and thymic epithelium does not perturb T cell development (S. Habu, personal communication), indicating that Delta1 is dispensable for physiological T cell lineage commitment. It is therefore possible that the T–B lineage decision may be regulated by (or compensated for) by other Delta family members. Stromal cells expressing Delta4 can also suppress B cell development and induce T cell commitment *in vitro* (S. Habu, personal communication).

After commitment to the T cell lineage, a second cell fate decision faced by early thymocyte progenitors is whether to become an αβ or a γδ T cell⁷⁴. Whether Notch signaling influences this lineage decision is still unresolved. In mice reconstituted with a mixture of *Notch1*⁺/⁺ and *Notch1*⁺/⁻ bone marrow, relatively more γδ (rather than αβ) T cells were produced from *Notch1*⁺/⁻ than from wild-type precursors⁷⁵, thus raising the possibility that Notch1 signaling may preferentially promote αβ T cell development at the expense of γδ T cells.

Nevertheless, *Lck-Cre*-mediated *Notch1* deletion early in intrathymic development (before the pre-TCR checkpoint) has no apparent effect on γδ T cell numbers or phenotype<sup>76</sup>. Similarly, *Lck-Cre*-mediated inactivation of CSL does not affect absolute numbers of γδ T cells, although γδ T cell turnover seems to be perturbed (T. Honjo, personal communication). The loss-of-function studies indicate that Notch signaling does not have a decisive function in the αβ–γδ lineage decision. However, the possibility that *Notch1* or *CSL* deletion occurs after αβ–γδ lineage commitment in a common Notch-dependent precursor cannot be excluded<sup>77</sup>.

Although inactivation of *Notch1* through the *Lck-Cre* recombinase does not conclusively answer the question of whether *Notch1* is involved in γδ T cell development, it does show that *Notch1* has nonredundant functions in the αβ T cell lineage. Indeed, *Notch1* deficiency leads to a partial block of αβ T cell development at the pre-TCR checkpoint because of inhibition of VDJ<sub>β</sub> (but not DJ<sub>β</sub>) rearrangement<sup>76</sup>. Moreover, whereas immature thymocytes incapable of forming a functional pre-TCR are normally eliminated by apoptosis<sup>78</sup>, *Notch1*-deficient intracellular TCRβ-negative pre-T cells accumulate in the thymus<sup>76</sup>. Therefore, *Notch1* signaling may have a dual function during early intrathymic αβ T cell development: it is linked to VDJ<sub>β</sub> rearrangement, and is involved in eliminating thymocytes that fail to form functional pre-TCRs. The mechanism by which *Notch1* mediates these important functions is unclear at present.

During their further differentiation along the αβ lineage, CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> thymocytes must adopt either a CD4 or a CD8 cell fate. The longstanding controversy surrounding the function of Notch signaling in the CD4-versus-CD8 lineage decision has finally been resolved. Although two independent lines of transgenic mice expressing *Notch1*-IC under control of the *Lck* promoter had phenotypes consistent with a function for Notch signaling in the CD4-CD8 lineage decision<sup>10,24,79</sup>, more recent loss-of-function studies have contradicted this hypothesis. Indeed conditional inactivation of *Notch1* (ref. 80) or *CSL* (T. Honjo, personal communication) after the pre-TCR checkpoint does not result in any detectable developmental skewing of mature CD4 and/or CD8 thymocytes. Thus it is now apparent that Notch signaling is dispensable for the CD4-CD8 lineage decision.

### Notch and peripheral T cell function

Although the expression pattern of Notch receptors and ligands in peripheral T cells, B cells and antigen-presenting cells is indicative of an important function for Notch signaling in peripheral T cells (Fig. 2), there is no clear consensus on this subject. Three lines of evidence indicate that Notch signaling induces differentiation of naive T cells into regulatory T cells. Constitutive expression of Jagged1 on murine antigen-presenting cells induced peripheral T cells to differentiate into regulatory T cells that inhibited both primary and secondary immune responses<sup>81</sup>. In other studies, priming of naive human T cells in the presence of Jagged1-expressing antigen-presenting cells led to reduced proliferation and a partial inhibition of the cytotoxic effector function of CD8 T cells<sup>82,83</sup>. Finally, signaling through the *Notch3* receptor may regulate the development, expansion and/or function of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cell populations<sup>84</sup>. These regulatory T cells show higher *Notch3* expression than do CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup> conventional T cells. Moreover, transgenic mice expressing *Notch3*-IC under control of the proximal *Lck* promoter showed increased regulatory T cell function, as evidenced by a higher degree of protection than that of control mice in a model of inducible autoimmune diabetes.

*Notch3* was also shown to be involved in T helper cell differentiation. After antigen stimulation, CD4 T cells differentiate into two classes of T helper cells (*T<sub>H</sub>1* and *T<sub>H</sub>2*) that are defined by their cytokine pattern<sup>85</sup>. *Notch3* signaling through Delta1 biases CD4 T cells toward a *T<sub>H</sub>1* phenotype<sup>86</sup>. Soluble forms of Delta1 (Delta1-Fc) induce CD4 T cells *in vitro* to express interferon-γ (IFN-γ) even when they are cultured in *T<sub>H</sub>2*-inducing conditions. In addition, overexpression of *Notch3*-IC but not *Notch1*-IC leads to an increase in IFN-γ production and a concurrent decrease in interleukin 4 (IL-4) production. Most convincingly, Delta1-Fc promoted healing of lesions and concomitant *T<sub>H</sub>1* development in BALB/c mice infected with *Leishmania major*<sup>86</sup>. These mice normally cannot control their infection because they develop a predominant *T<sub>H</sub>2* response. The view that Delta1-mediated Notch signaling favors a *T<sub>H</sub>1* response was challenged recently. In a transplantation model, it was shown that Delta1-induced Notch signaling prolongs graft survival by downregulating a *T<sub>H</sub>1* response<sup>87</sup>. It will be of great interest to confirm these suggested functions for *Notch3* and/or *Delta1* in the relevant gene targeted mice.

In addition to biasing development of T helper cells, Notch signaling may also be required for TCR-mediated activation and proliferation of peripheral T cells<sup>88,89</sup>. *In vitro* T cell activation induces expression of *Notch1*, *Notch2* and *Notch4* (refs. 88,89). Moreover, disruption of Notch signaling with pharmacological inhibitors that block signaling of all Notch receptors leads to a decrease in T cell proliferation and reduced IL-2 (refs. 88,89) and IFN-γ production<sup>89</sup>. The effect of Notch signaling on T cell proliferation seems to be complex, as high concentrations of an activating ligand, Delta1-Fc, actually suppress proliferation of T cells *in vitro*<sup>86</sup>. Enhancement or inhibition of T cell proliferation may therefore be dependent on the amount of Notch signaling. Proliferation of activated T cells *in vivo* is unaffected in *Notch1*-deficient mice<sup>90</sup>; however, this may be regulated by other Notch receptors.

#### Notch and B cell development

In addition to its well established function in the T cell lineage, Notch signaling is important in later stages of B cell development. Inactivation of *CSL* in B cells with a transgenic mouse expressing Cre recombinase under control of the CD19 promoter showed normal development of immature bone marrow B cells, indicating that CSL-dependent Notch signaling is dispensable early in B cell development<sup>91</sup>. However, B cell-specific inactivation of *CSL* leads to a loss of splenic marginal zone B (MZB) cells accompanied by moderate increases in follicular B (FoB) cells. Mint, a negative regulator of Notch signaling, is expressed in FoB cells but less so in MZB cells. Mint deficiency leads to the reciprocal phenotype of *CSL* deficiency. Splenic B cells differentiate more efficiently to MZB cells, with a concomitant reduction of FoB cells<sup>19</sup>. Based on these data, it was suggested that *CSL*-mediated Notch signaling regulates the binary cell fate decision of a common precursor that can differentiate into MZB cells or FoB cells<sup>91</sup> (Fig. 3).

Among the family of Notch receptors, *Notch2* is expressed mainly in B cells, whereas *Notch1* and *Notch3* are most abundantly expressed in immature thymocytes, and *Notch4* expression is barely detectable in murine lymphocytes<sup>19,56,92</sup>. *Notch2* expression increases with B cell maturation and is most prominent in splenic B cells<sup>56</sup>. Consistent with this expression pattern, *Notch2* is an essential receptor for MZB cell development<sup>56</sup>. Conditional inactivation of *Notch2* in the hematopoietic compartment leads to a selective loss of MZB cells (similar to *CSL* inactivation), indicating that *Notch2* signals through *CSL* to specify this lineage. The loss of MZB cells in conditional *Notch2*-targeted mice, however, is not accompanied by an increase in FoB cells. Whether MZB and FoB cells originate from a common precursor requires further investigation.

Although considerable information has been obtained regarding Notch signaling in lymphocytes through conditional inactivation of

Notch1, Notch2 and CSL, much less is known about the specific Notch ligands that engage these Notch receptors in physiological conditions. Delta1 has recently been identified as the nonredundant ligand of Notch2 associated with MZB cell fate specification. Conditional inactivation of Delta1 with the interferon-inducible *Mx-Cre* transgene leads to the selective loss of MZB cells in the spleen (S. Habu, personal communication) that is indistinguishable from Notch2 (ref. 56) and CSL91 deficiency. Delta1 is expressed on dendritic cells but not on B cells or other lymphocytes19, indicating that Notch2 on B cells specifically interacts with Delta1 on dendritic cells to specify the MZB cell fate. These data formally establishes that MZB cell development is regulated by an unique Notch receptor-ligand pair. Whether specificity of receptor-ligand interactions is a typical feature of Notch signaling *in vivo* despite the fact that redundancy can readily be demonstrated in *in vitro* conditions93 (S. Habu, personal communication), must be investigated.

### Conclusions

Notch signaling controls multiple cell fate decisions and differentiation processes during lymphocyte development and function. The most well established function of Notch signaling until recently was the essential function of Notch1 in T cell versus B cell fate specification. Generation of conditional gene-targeted mice for the CSL protein, as well as for the Notch2 receptor and Delta1 ligand, has confirmed the involvement of Notch1 in T cell development and has demonstrated previously unknown, nonredundant functions for Notch2 and Delta1 in splenic B cell differentiation. Within the family of four Notch receptors and five ligands, it is possible that certain receptors or ligands might be functionally redundant. However, so far, at least for Notch1, Notch2 and Delta1, functional redundancy has not been reported. The question of ligand-receptor specificity will be answered best by the use of similar targeting strategies for other Notch receptors and ligands in the near future. Other questions concerning Notch specific target genes, the physiological function of different Notch modifiers within the hematopoietic compartment, the differences between Jagged- and Delta-mediated Notch signaling or the cross-talk between Notch and other signal transduction pathways remain to be investigated. Because it is becoming increasingly apparent that Notch participates in the pathogenesis of several human tumors, resolution of these questions should provide further insights for new cancer therapeutics.
