Sigma-1 receptor (Sig-1R, σ1R, also referred to as sigma receptor 1, SigR1) is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) protein that is specifically located at the mitochondria-associated ER membrane (MAM), which interfaces between the ER and mitochondria. At the level of MAM, Sig-1R functions as a molecular chaperone that ensures proper calcium (Ca²⁺) transfer from the ER to the mitochondria and participates in the ER stress response to accumulation of unfolded proteins. On activation by agonists or in the setting of cell stress, Sig-1R translocates from the MAM to the plasma membrane, where it interacts with a variety of receptors and ion channels, or to the nuclear envelope, where it contributes to regulation of gene transcription.

Evidence from experimental models indicates that Sig-1R is involved in the pathobiology of several neurodegenerative disorders associated with impaired proteostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered RNA metabolism. A prototypical example is amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Variants of the SIGMAR1 gene encoding Sig-1R have been linked with familial ALS/frontotemporal dementia; an autosomal recessive mutation (E102Q) in SIGMAR1 has been linked to juvenile ALS. These mutations are associated with several ER stress-mediated defects in proteostasis and dysregulation of RNA-binding proteins. Studies in *Sigmar1* knockout mice indicate that disturbed ER-mitochondria interactions are at the core of motoneuron degeneration. Activation of Sig-1R exerts neuroprotective effects on motoneurons in the superoxide dismutase (SOD) mutation model of the disease. Therefore, Sig-1R provides a potential therapeutic target for ALS, as well as other neurodegenerative disorders associated with impaired proteostasis and mitochondrial function. There are several reviews on the role of Sig-1R in normal cell function and neurodegenerative disorders.¹⁻¹²

## Structure and distribution of the Sig-1R

### Structure

Sig-1R and sigma-2 receptors are unique nonopioid receptors that have no structural homology with any classic transmembrane G protein–coupled receptors or ligand-gated ion channel families. Crystallographic studies show that Sig-1R has a trimeric organization and contains only a single transmembrane domain for each protomer (figure).¹³,¹⁴ SigR1 is an ER chaperone that resides in specialized ceramide-enriched domains of the ER membrane directly apposing mitochondria (MAM)¹,¹⁵ (figure). Several endogenous molecules may function as Sig-1R ligands, including lipids such as sphingosine and its derivatives, steroids such as pregnenolone sulfate, and N-N-dimethyl tryptamine. Many synthetic compounds function as selective agonists or antagonists of the receptor, including benzomorphans such as (+) pentazocine and psychotropic drugs such as cocaine and haloperidol.¹⁶

### Distribution

Sig-1R is distributed in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes and in non-neural tissues. In the CNS, the highest level of expression is in spinal and brainstem motoneurons. In

these cells, Sig-1R is primarily located at cholinergic postsynaptic densities, also known as C-terminals, in ER cisterna located at a short distance below the postsynaptic membrane. These postsynaptic sites are enriched with muscarinic M2 receptors and receive presynaptic boutons from cholinergic interneurons.

## Sig-1R as an ER chaperone at the MAM

At the MAM, Sig-1R binds the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP) also known as 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein or heat shock 70-kDa protein 5. This ER chaperone is constitutively expressed and is critically involved in

### Figure Structure and function of the sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R)

[Diagram description: The figure illustrates the structure and function of the sigma-1 receptors (Sig-1R) within cellular compartments, including interactions with various proteins and organelles such as the plasma membrane, mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus.]

The Sig-1R has a trimeric organization and contains only a single transmembrane domain for each promoter. The SigR1 resides in specialized domains of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane directly apposing mitochondria, mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM). At the MAM, the SigR1 binds the binding immunoglobulin protein (BiP). Dissociation of the Sig-1R from BiP allows the receptors to act as a molecular chaperone at the MAM and to interact with other molecules in the plasma and nuclear membranes. At the MAM, the Sig-1R binds to and stabilizes the inositol triphosphate receptor type 3 (ITPR3), which allows efflux of calcium ($\text{Ca}^{2+}$) from the ER to the mitochondria, thereby promoting normal mitochondrial function, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. The voltage-dependent anion channel 1 (VDAC) localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane forms a complex with the ITPR3 and facilitates $\text{Ca}^{2+}$ efflux from the ER to the mitochondria. In response to oxidative stress and accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER, the Sig-1R interacts with and stabilizes the inositol required protein 1 (IRE1); this enzyme splices the mRNA encoding the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1), thereby promoting its translation, followed by its translocation to the nucleus, in which it upregulates expression of several ER chaperones, components of the ER degradation system (ERAD), and antioxidant proteins. On translocation to the plasma membrane, the Sig-1R interacts with a wide variety of targets, including acid-sensitive cation channels (ASIC), voltage-gated sodium ($\text{Na}_{v}$), calcium ($\text{Ca}_{v}$), and potassium ($\text{K}_{v}$) channels, calcium-activated potassium channels (BK), the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor, muscarinic M2 and dopamine D2 receptors, and tyrosine kinase receptors such as tropomyosin kinase receptor B (TrkB). The Sig-1R translocates from the ER to the outer nuclear membrane and interacts with the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin, thereby regulating gene transcription.

folding, assembly, and translocation of proteins. The binding to BiP normally prevents Sig-1R from translocation to other membrane compartments. Several stimuli trigger dissociation of Sig-1R from its binding with BiP, allowing the receptor to act as a molecular chaperone at the MAM and to interact with other molecules in the plasma and nuclear membranes.

**Regulation of ER-to-mitochondria signaling**

Sig-1R binds to the inositol triphosphate receptor type 3 (IPR3, formerly IP₃R3) at the MAM. When activated by inositol triphosphate, the ITPR3 allows efflux of Ca²⁺ from the ER to the mitochondria, which is critical for normal mitochondrial function, including adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production. Under physiologic conditions, Sig-1R bound to BiP forms a Ca²⁺-sensitive chaperone machinery; lowering of the local Ca²⁺ concentration after Ca²⁺ efflux from the ER via ITPR3 causes Sig1-R to dissociate from BiP. After dissociation from BiP, Sig-1R stabilizes and prevents proteasomal degradation of ITPR3, thereby assuring proper Ca²⁺ efflux from the ER to the mitochondria. Ankyrin B is a cytoskeletal adaptor protein that interacts with ITPR3 and inhibits Ca²⁺ efflux from the ER; interactions with Sig-1R cause dissociation of ankyrin B from ITPR3. The voltage-dependent anion channel localized in the outer mitochondrial membrane forms a complex with the ITPR3 at the level of MAM that facilitates Ca²⁺ efflux from the ER to the mitochondria.

In addition to promoting Ca²⁺ efflux from the ER to the mitochondria, there are several other mechanisms by which Sig-1R regulates mitochondrial function via the MAM. The MAM is a center for intermembrane transport of phospholipids cholesterol, ceramides, ATP, and proteins as well as in proteasomal protein degradation and lipid droplet formation. Interactions between Sig-1R and voltage-dependent ion channels regulate cholesterol import to the mitochondria for synthesis of steroids. The MAM is a crucial component of the mitochondrial fission machinery, which together with fusion is required for maintenance of the structure and function of the organelle. Studies in knockout mice indicate that the absence of Sig-1R impairs mitochondrial fission and disrupts mitochondrial transport in motoneuron axons. Interactions of Sig-1R with mitochondria may promote survival by mechanisms that are not directly related to its functions at the MAM. For example, it increases expression of the antiapoptotic Bcl-2 protein in response to accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and may attenuate oxidative stress via upregulation of expression of antioxidant enzymes such as SOD1 via activation of the antioxidant response element in DNA.

**Role in proteostasis**

External insults or mutations that affect the balance between synthesis and degradation of proteins result in accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER. This triggers the unfolded protein response, which regulates protein homeostasis via transient suppression of global RNA translation (translational unfolded protein responses) and activation of transcription of genes that promote protein folding and antioxidant protection, or, alternatively, cell death by apoptosis (transcriptional unfolded protein response). The unfolded protein response is orchestrated by 3 transmembrane ER proteins: protein kinase RNA-like ER kinase, inositol-requiring protein 1 (IRE1), and activated transcription factor 6. These proteins become activated on their dissociation from BiP in response misfolded protein accumulation. IRE1 is present in the MAM and is activated by ROS derived from the mitochondria. This protein functions as an RNase that splices the mRNA encoding the transcription factor X-box binding protein 1, thereby promoting translation, followed by translocation of this transcription factor to the nucleus, where it upregulates expression several ER chaperones and antioxidant proteins. Expression of SIGMAR1 encoding Sig-1R is upregulated during ER stress as an effector of the unfolded protein response. The Sig-1R interacts with and stabilizes IRE1 to assure this proper mitochondria-ER-nucleus signaling axis.

**Effects in the plasma membrane and the nuclear membrane**

Cellular stress and some Sig-1R agonists, such as cocaine or (+) pentazocine, cause Sig-1R to dissociate from BiP and translocate from the MAM to the plasma membrane or nuclear lamina.

**Effects at the plasma membrane**

On translocation to the plasma membrane, Sig-1R interacts with a wide variety of targets, including ion channels, ion channel receptors, G protein-coupled receptors, and tyrosine kinase receptors, thereby regulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity. These effects are complex, may involve direct or indirect interactions, and vary with the cell type. In general, Sig-1R inhibits voltage-gated Na⁺ channels but has a bidirectional cell-specific effect on voltage-gated Ca²⁺ and K⁺ channels. For example, Sig-1R activates L-channels in CA1 hippocampal neurons but inhibits these channels in retinal ganglion cells. Sig-1R directly inhibits A-type K⁺ currents via direct interactions with Kv1.4 channels, thereby increasing dendritic excitability. Sig-1R also modulates excitatory neurotransmission via interactions with NMDA receptors and cannabinoid receptor 1.

**Effects of Sig-1R in motoneurons**

Of potential relevance for ALS are the effects of Sig-1R in reducing excitability of motoneurons. As mentioned earlier, Sig-1R is selectively expressed in ER cisternae located at a short distance below the postsynaptic cholinergic densities expressing M2 muscarinic receptors; these postsynaptic regions are also enriched of voltage-gated K⁺ channels (Kᵥ2.1) and Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels. Activation of Sig-1R reduces motoneuron excitability by promoting the activity of these channels. Knockout of Sig-1R in the SOD1*G93A mouse model of ALS results in increased excitability of

motoneurons and reduced longevity.²¹ This suggests that Sig-1R may exert a neuroprotective effect by reducing motor neuron activity in the setting of cellular stressors known to be associated with ALS.

### Effect at the nuclear envelope

The nuclear envelope consists of an inner and an outer nuclear membrane and is a highly organized dynamic barrier that separates the nucleus from the cytosol. The nuclear envelope forms a continuous network with the ER as both the inner and outer nuclear membranes are contiguous with the rough ER membrane. The Sig-1R translocates from the ER to the outer nuclear membrane and interacts with the inner nuclear membrane protein emerin, and with the nuclear pore complex protein Ran-binding protein 2. The interaction of Sig-1R with emerin at the nuclear envelope may regulate gene transcription by recruiting histone deacetylases and transcription factors to promoter regions of DNA.

### Role of Sig-1R in ALS

ALS is a prototype disorder resulting from converging mechanisms of neurodegeneration. These include excitotoxicity and Ca²⁺ overload, leading to activation of outer mitochondrial permeability transition; impaired mitochondrial dynamics and function resulting in reduced ATP production, Ca²⁺ dysregulation, ROS production, and triggering of apoptosis; ER stress leading to the unfolded protein response; impaired ubiquitin-proteasome system and autophagy; dysregulation of RNA metabolism; and reactive gliosis involving both astrocytes and microglia. Both familial and sporadic forms of ALS, as well as many other neurodegenerative disorders, are associated with abnormal accumulation of cytoplasmic inclusions, which are the manifestation of impaired proteostasis, RNA regulation, and autophagy. The prominent expression of Sig-1R in motoneurons and its pleotropic neuroprotective effects indicate its prominent role in ALS. A study on *Sigmar1* knockout mice revealed that affected animals display locomotor deficits associated with muscle weakness, axonal degeneration, and motor neuron loss.¹¹ Pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of Sig-1R led to motor neuron axonal degeneration, followed by cell death in motor neuron cultures; this was associated with disturbed MAM contacts, altered intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling, ER stress, and impaired mitochondrial fission and transport.¹¹ The first indication of the involvement of Sig-1R in ALS was the finding of a variant in the 3′ untranslated region of *SIGMAR1* in pedigrees with autosomal dominant ALS associated with frontotemporal lobar degeneration.²² This variant increased Sig-1R levels in both lymphocytes and brain tissue and was associated with the presence of cytoplasmic inclusions immunopositive for TAR DNA-binding protein 43 (TDP-43) or fused in sarcoma (FUS).²² A mutation (E102Q) in a highly conserved amino acid located in the transmembrane domain of Sig-1R was identified in a family with juvenile ALS.¹⁰ The mutated Sig-1R protein had an aberrant subcellular distribution and reduced the resistance to apoptosis induced by ER stress in transfected NSC34 cells (a motor neuron cell-like model).¹⁰ A study showed reduced expression and abnormal accumulation of Sig-1R in enlarged C-terminals and the ER of α-motoneurons in the postmortem lumbar spinal cord of patients with sporadic ALS; in cultured fibroblasts of patients with familial ALS associated with vesicle-associated membrane protein B mutations (ALS8); in motoneurons of transgenic mice harboring SOD1 mutations; and in neuronal cell culture models.⁸ In this study, knockdown of Sig-1R in culture cell lines induced the unfolded protein response, followed by inhibition of the ubiquitin-proteasome system, accumulation of misfolded proteins, deformation of ER, and accumulation of ER-derived vacuoles associated with autophagy.⁸ Pharmacologic or genetic inactivation of Sig-1R also led to disturbed MAM contacts, affected intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling, ER stress, impaired mitochondrial fission and transport, and axonal degeneration, followed by cell death in motor neuron cultures.¹¹ Studies in transfected cells and in lymphoblastoid cells derived from a patient carrying the E102Q mutation of the Sig-1R causing juvenile ALS showed that mutated Sig-1R rapidly aggregates and accumulates in the ER and associated compartments, leading to structural alteration of the ER, mitochondria, and nuclear envelope.⁹ This led to subsequent defects in Ca²⁺ homeostasis and the proteasome and further induced impairment of autophagy, accumulation of stress granules, and cytoplasmic aggregation of ALS-related proteins TDP-43, FUS, and matrin-3. Overall, these experimental findings indicate that the involvement of Sig-1R in ALS may reflect loss of function, toxic gain of function, or both, leading to altered chaperone function, abnormal ER to mitochondria Ca²⁺ signaling, and ER stress leading to apoptosis; impaired proteostasis by the ubiquitin-proteasome system; and altered RNA metabolism.

### Therapeutic implications

Studies in experimental models indicate that Sig-1R agonists may have neuroprotective effects in motoneuron survival in the setting of abnormal protein accumulation or injury. Pharmacologic activation of Sig-1R induced clearance of mutant protein aggregates and neuroprotection in a cell culture model of ALS8.⁸ Treatment of SOD1 mice with Sig-1R agonists enhanced motoneuron function and increased animal survival; this was associated with normalization of Ca²⁺ homeostasis in cultured motor neurons.²³

Sig-1R agonists also promoted neuroprotection and neurite elongation in motoneurons after ventral root avulsion. In motoneurons, Sig-1R colocalizes in C-terminals with indole (ethyl)amine-N-methyl transferase; this enzyme produces the Sig-1R agonist, N,N′-dimethyltryptamine, and neutralizes endogenous toxic sulfur and selenium derivatives.⁷ This indicates that small molecule activation of the Sig-1R may provide a neuroprotective strategy to treat ALS by reducing oxidative stress in motor neurons.²⁴

# Perspective

There is ample evidence that Sig-1R may have pivotal functions required for motoneuron function and survival, including regulation of Ca²⁺ homeostasis, mitochondrial metabolism, maintenance of MAM integrity, ER stress response, proteostasis, autophagy, and modulation of neuronal excitability and plasticity. Evidence from experimental models indicates that activation of Sig-1R may exert neuroprotective effects not only in ALS but also in other disorders such as Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, Huntington disease, retinal degeneration, and stroke and may be a target for treatment of pain and psychiatric disorders.⁴,⁶ However, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved selective Sig-1R ligands for use in humans. Whereas many currently marketed psychotropic medications, such as haloperidol, fluvoxamine, and donepezil, may exert neuroprotective effects in experimental models in part by activating Sig-1R, their potential neuroprotective effect in human disease is uncertain. In a single clinical study in patients with ischemic stroke, the Sig-1R agonist cutamesine (SA4503) failed to elicit functional recovery.²⁵ Despite affecting multiple mechanisms in neurons, Sig-1R activation as a stand-alone treatment may not be sufficient, given the multidimensional nature of pathogenic mechanisms in neurodegenerative disorders. However, the Sig-1R may constitute a potential target for adjunctive therapy in association with other approaches. Agonists of Sig-1R may have a favorable safety profile reflecting a selective modulatory action during pathologic conditions while sparing normal physiologic activity.¹
