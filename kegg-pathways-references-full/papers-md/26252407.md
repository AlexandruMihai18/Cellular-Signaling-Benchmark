# Basic biology and role of interleukin-17 in immunity and inflammation

**CAMILLE ZENOBIA & GEORGE HAJISHENGALLIS**

Interleukin-17 and interleukin-17-producing lymphocytes and innate immune cells are emerging as potentially important players in the pathogenesis of periodontitis (62). Nearly all interleukin-17-related research in the field of periodontal disease involves the interleukin-17A isoform (also simply known as interleukin-17) and therefore this will be the focus of the present review. To understand the role of interleukin-17 in periodontitis, it is instructive to discuss, first of all, the basic biology of this cytokine and the cells that produce it.

Interleukin-17 is one of the best-studied cytokines in immunology, at least in part because of its involvement in inflammatory pathology (4, 47, 106). The gene encoding interleukin-17 was cloned in 1993 from a mouse cytotoxic T-lymphocyte hybridoma cDNA library (130) and the role of human interleukin-17 in inflammation was recognized soon after (45, 159). However, interleukin-17 entered the spotlight of immunologic attention after the discovery of a developmentally distinct CD4⁺ T-helper subset that expresses interleukin-17 (the so-called T-helper 17 lineage) and mediates tissue inflammation (68, 121). Interleukin-17 (or interleukin-17A) is the founding member of a family of cytokines that also includes interleukin-17B through to interleukin-17F (57, 80). The cellular source of interleukin-17C is quite unique among the other isoforms because interleukin-17C is produced primarily by epithelial cells rather than by hematopoietic cells (127). The best-characterized cytokines in the family are interleukin-17 and interleukin-17F, which can signal as homodimers or as interleukin-17A/F heterodimers through the same heterodimeric receptor that comprises interleukin-17RA and interleukin-17RC subunits (Fig. 1). Interleukin-17RA is expressed ubiquitously on various cell types, as is interleukin-17RC, although their tissue-expression profile displays interesting differences. Interleukin-17RC is predominantly expressed in the epithelial cells of the prostate, kidney and joints, whereas interleukin-17RA is abundantly expressed in hematopoietic cell compartments (74). If the binding repertoire of interleukin-17RA and interleukin-17RC includes distinct ligands, this would explain, at least in part, their different tissue distribution. In this regard, interleukin-17RA oligomerizes also with interleukin-17RB, and the interleukin-17RA/RB complex binds interleukin-17E, also known as interleukin-25 (tissues that are responsive to interleukin-25 might therefore express higher levels of interleukin-17RA than of interleukin-17RC). Interleukin-17RA additionally pairs with interleukin-17RD, although the cognate ligand (if it exists) for the interleukin-17RA/RD complex has not been identified (129). The different tissue distribution of interleukin-17RA and interleukin-17RC may also serve to allow tissue-specific signaling by interleukin-17A, interleukin-17F and interleukin-17A/F because these ligands have differential binding affinities for each of the interleukin-17RC and interleukin-17RA subunits, although overall interleukin-17A binds to the interleukin-17RA/RC complex with higher affinity than does interleukin-17F (74). Interestingly, interleukin-17B and interleukin-17C can signal through monomeric receptors (interleukin-17RB and interleukin-17RE, respectively), whereas the receptor for interleukin-17D is unknown (80).

Although a signature cytokine of T-helper 17 cells, interleukin-17 is now known to be expressed also by other adaptive- and immune-cell types, including CD8⁺ T-cells, γδ T-cells, natural killer T-cells and innate lymphoid cells (29, 143) (Fig. 2). The γδ T-cells constitute a relatively minor lymphoid-cell subset in lymphoid tissues and blood but they are a major

T-cell-receptor engagement (143). Interleukin-17 was also shown to be expressed by mouse neutrophils (42, 97) and, more recently, a population of human neutrophils was identified that expresses the transcription factor retinoid-related orphan receptor-gamma t (RORγt) and both produces and responds to interleukin-17 (145, 146). Consistent with a certain degree of inherent plasticity, naive T-cells, memory T-cells and CD4⁺ FOXP3⁺ regulatory T-cells have all been shown to have the ability to differentiate into an interleukin-17-producing phenotype (90, 150, 157). The resulting interleukin-17-producing T-cell can express varying concentrations of different effectors, such as interleukin-17 and interleukin-10, potentially exhibiting either a pathogenic or a regulatory phenotype (103).

Interleukin-17 is of particular interest in the pathogenesis of periodontitis because of its involvement in both inflammation and protective antimicrobial immunity (87) (Fig. 3). In the latter regard, interleukin-17 was shown to mediate protection against extracellular pathogens (72, 87) and, together with interleukin-22 (a cytokine also produced by T-helper 17 and other interleukin-17-expressing cells; Fig. 2), can induce the production of antimicrobial peptides (100), which are thought to be protective in periodontitis (36, 52). Therefore, in principle, interleukin-17 is a paradigmatic double-edged sword for a disease, such as periodontitis, that is initiated by bacteria, although tissue damage is inflicted by the host response (62). However, the biological properties of interleukin-17 make it difficult to predict its role in inflammatory diseases with a polymicrobial etiology. It is possible that interleukin-17 exerts both protective and destructive effects, as suggested in distinct mouse models (42, 160), although chronic interleukin-17 receptor signaling can turn a potentially protective acute inflammatory response into chronic immunopathology (102). Interleukin-17 and interleukin-17-producing cells that display inflammatory, antimicrobial and regulatory functions are therefore of keen interest in the development and progression of periodontal disease and their nuances are discussed in this review.

## Differentiation and function of interleukin-17-producing T-cells

The local cytokine environment contributes to the differentiation of specific T-cell subsets with distinct transcription patterns, resulting in unique effector functions. In the classical T-helper 1/T-helper 2 paradigm (110), the differentiation of T-helper 1

Fig. 2. Differentiation of T-helper 17 cells and other interleukin-17-producing cell subsets. Of the lymphoid cells that are capable of producing interleukin-17, the differentiation process of CD4⁺ interleukin-17-producing T-cells (T-helper 17 cells) is the best defined and depends on a specific cytokine milieu provided by innate and adaptive immune-cell sources. Moreover, the induction of the T-helper 17 lineage from a naïve T-cell requires engagement of CD28 and inducible T-cell costimulator (ICOS) by the costimulatory molecules B7 and B7H, respectively, on antigen-presenting cells (APC). Transforming growth factor-beta (TGFβ), combined with specific immunostimulatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6, can induce T-helper 17 cell differentiation in mice. Although in humans the requirement for T-helper 17 cell development is met with interleukin-6 and interleukin-1beta, when the starting population is rigorously sorted for naive T-cells and hidden sources of transforming growth factor-beta in the culture conditions are accounted for, similar factors appear to govern T-helper 17 cell differentiation in mice and humans. In both species, interleukin-21 feeds back on developing T-helper 17 cells and reinforces the differentiation process, whilst interleukin-23 promotes expansion and survival of T-helper 17 cells. The cytokines that induce T-helper 17 cell differentiation and function act via the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and retinoid-related orphan receptor-gamma t (RORγt), which represent the lineage-specific transcription factor of T-helper 17 cells. The differentiation requirements for other interleukin-17-producing cell subsets are less well defined; factors are shown that are thought to contribute to the differentiation process. Innate cellular sources for interleukin-17 production include RORγt⁺ innate lymphoid cells [interleukin-C (ILC)], natural killer T (NKT) cells and γδ T-cells, which do not require T-cell-receptor stimulation for interleukin-17 production. In addition to the typical T-helper 17 cells, interleukin-17 can be produced also (albeit at lower levels) by CD4⁺ regulatory T-helper 17 cells, which express high levels of the suppressive cytokine, interleukin-10. Another adaptive immune-cell source of interleukin-17 is CD8⁺ cytotoxic T-cells (Tc17). Up-regulation of the interleukin-23 receptor (interleukin-23R) is essential for most subsets to initiate the production of interleukin-17. Also shown are other important cytokines produced by each cell subset. The figure was drawn based on information from several sources (2, 13, 43, 83, 89, 90, 95, 157, 163).

and T-helper 2 cell subsets are driven by interleukin-12 and interleukin-4, respectively, and the key transcription factors driving their differentiation are T-bet (T-helper 1) and GATA3 (T-helper 2). T-helper 1 cells secrete interferon-gamma and are primarily responsible for cell-mediated immunity to intracellular pathogens (bacteria, protozoans and viruses). On the other hand, T-helper 2 cells secrete interleukin-4, interleukin-5 and interleukin-13, and are responsible for humoral immunity, including production of IgE, and

Fig. 3. Biological functions of interleukin-17 and their role in periodontitis. Interleukin-17 acts predominantly on innate immune and stromal cells to promote inflammation and antimicrobial functions. By acting through fibroblast up-regulation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and C-X-C motif (CXC) chemokines, interleukin-17 can orchestrate bone marrow production and release of neutrophils and their chemotactic recruitment to the periodontium. Additionally, interleukin-17 inhibits endothelial cell production of Del-1, a glycoprotein that restrains neutrophil extravasation by blocking the interaction of the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) integrin on neutrophils with the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) on endothelial cells. Neutrophils can exert both protective and destructive effects in periodontitis and thus their homeostatic regulation is key to periodontal health. Interleukin-17 can promote the destruction of both connective tissue and the underlying bone by stimulating the production of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and RANKL from the indicated stromal cell types. Although interleukin-17 can also induce the production of epithelial cell-derived antimicrobial molecules, the current burden of evidence from human and animal model studies suggests that the net effect of interleukin-17 signaling promotes disease development. The figure was drawn based on information from several sources (5, 40, 42, 48, 80, 100, 106, 152). IL, interleukin; PGE₂, prostaglandin E₂; TNF, tumor necrosis factor.

starting population is rigorously sorted for naive T-cells and hidden sources of transforming growth factor-beta in the culture conditions are revealed, it then appears that similar factors govern the differentiation of T-helper 17 cells in mice and humans (90). In both species, interleukin-21 feeds back on developing T-helper 17 cells and amplifies the differentiation process (Fig. 2), whereas innate immune-cell-derived interleukin-23 is required for expansion and survival of T-helper 17 cells (90). Acting alone, transforming growth factor-beta is suppressive for development of T-helper 17 cells and instead initiates differentiation into regulatory T-cells by up-regulating the FOXP3 transcription factor (163). Conversely, RORγt, a transcription factor up-regulated during differentiation toward T-helper 17, inhibits FOXP3 and thereby suppresses the development of regulatory T-cells (163). Additional suppression of FOXP3 can be directly mediated by interleukin-6 and interleukin-21 (89, 157).

Whilst the differentiation of T-helper 17 cells and regulatory T-cells appears mutually exclusive, the presence of interleukin-6 coupled with the production of transforming growth factor-beta by regulatory T-cells may allow the conversion of regulatory T-cells to T-helper 17 cells, suggesting a degree of plasticity (13). The differentiation of regulatory T-cells toward a T-helper 17 phenotype can start before full inhibition of FOXP3, thereby creating a double-positive (inter-
leukin-17⁺/FOXP3⁺) cell type (153). There is also plasticity in the T-helper 17 cell in that it can acquire functional characteristics of T-helper 1 cells, manifested as interferon-gamma production (113). Although there is a paucity of literature regarding the mechanisms of T-cell differentiation in periodontal tissues, the implications of this T-cell plasticity might contribute to the transition from active inflammation in sites of periodontal disease to a resolution phase.

Although the typical interleukin-17-producing T-cell can be involved in potent inflammatory responses, recently a regulatory T-helper 17 cell subset that expresses the anti-inflammatory cytokine, interleukin-10, has been identified (Fig. 2). The regulatory T-helper 17 cells can be found *in vivo* in certain autoimmune diseases and were shown to mitigate pathology in a mouse model of colitis (43, 83). It should also be noted that regulatory T-helper 17 cells produce less interleukin-17 than do the typical T-helper 17 cells. Intriguingly, naïve CD4⁺ T-cells can differentiate into either a pathogenic or a nonpathogenic T-helper 17 phenotype, depending on the subtype of transforming growth factor-beta used to induce T-helper 17 differentiation (95). T-helper 17 cells generated with transforming growth factor-beta1 and interleukin-6 produce interleukin-17 but cannot drive autoimmune pathology in the absence of interleukin-23, whereas T-helper 17 cells generated with transforming growth factor-beta3 and interleukin-6 define a pathogenic effector subset that can induce autoimmunity, as shown in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalitis (95). These studies illustrate that the complexity of the cytokine milieu is key in directing the specific functional characteristics of T-helper 17 effector cells, which can thereby play pathogenic or regulatory roles in inflammatory diseases.

primarily epithelial, endothelial and other stromal cells, such as fibroblasts, osteoblasts, chondrocytes and synovial cells (21, 76, 77, 102, 136). Interestingly, interleukin-17 appears to be insufficient to mount a robust inflammatory response by itself; however, in cooperation or synergism with other inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-17 can induce a potent inflammatory cascade by up-regulating the expression of a plethora of target genes (38, 56, 119, 120). For instance, interleukin-17, together with tumor necrosis factor, induces a sustained neutrophil recruitment during inflammation, in part by synergistically up-regulating endothelial cell expression of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CXCL5 (56). Interleukin-17 can additionally stabilize CXCL1 mRNA and enhance interleukin-1beta-mediated cellular release of CXCL8 (39, 70). The production of interleukin-17 is dependent on the action of certain other cytokines, such as interleukin-1beta and interleukin-23 (142). In fact, interleukin-1beta has been shown to synergize with interleukin-23 to induce production of interleukin-17 (37, 105).

Interleukin-1beta is a versatile cytokine with a broad range of functions that can shape the lymphocyte response and is commonly found in gingival crevice fluid and tissues clinically diagnosed with periodontal disease (9, 53, 138). Interleukin-1beta, combined with interleukin-17, can synergistically increase the production of chemokine C-C motif ligand 20 (CCL20) in human gingival fibroblasts, thereby stimulating the recruitment of T-helper 17 cells (73). Interestingly, in human gingival fibroblasts, interleukin-1beta can also induce hypoxia-inducible factor-1 (147), which is known to control the T-helper 17-regulatory T-cell balance in favor of T-helper 17 cell development (31). Collectively, these data suggest that interleukin-1beta and interleukin-17 cooperatively promote a T-helper 17 cell environment, which may have pathological implications in the oral gingival tissues. Interleukin-1beta has also been shown to synergize with tumor necrosis factor to produce interleukin-6, which is important for T-helper 17 cell differentiation (131).

As mentioned earlier, interleukin-6 and transforming growth factor-beta together promote T-helper 17 differentiation, whereas transforming growth factor-beta alone initiates regulatory T-cell development. In this context, transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-1beta have an antagonistic relationship because transforming growth factor-beta can inhibit production of interleukin-1beta as well as expression of interleukin-1R, thereby suppressing lymphocyte proliferation (71, 148, 154). Interleukin-1beta has also

# Interleukin-17 and inflammatory interactions with other cytokines

Interleukin-17 is known foremost for its ability to initiate a potent inflammatory response that includes the induction of granulopoiesis factors (granulocyte colony-stimulating factor) and neutrophil-specific chemokines [chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligands 1, 2, 5 and 8 (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL5 and CXCL8, respectively)], mediators of the acute-phase response (interleukin-6), pro-inflammatory/bone-resorptive cytokines (tumor necrosis factor, interleukin-1beta and RANKL) and matrix metalloproteinases (48, 99, 109, 149) (Fig. 3). The targets of interleukin-17 include

146been shown to induce the expression of complement component C3 in intestinal epithelial cells (108), whereas transforming growth factor-beta inhibits complement signaling by reducing the expression of complement factors C3a and C5a (140). These activities affect T-helper 17 development because inhibition of either C5a receptor (CD88) or C3a receptor signaling on CD4⁺ T-cells is thought to lead to regulatory T-cell development at the expense of T-helper 17 (92, 140). In summary, transforming growth factor-beta inhibits the induction of interleukin-17 and other T-helper 17-related cytokines (even though it is required for T-helper 17 cell differentiation), whereas interleukin-1beta, interleukin-23, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor and perhaps also complement appear to work together collectively to promote an interleukin-17 environment.

### Complement and interleukin-17

The junctional epithelium lies at the base of the gingival crevice and provides a porous border between the underlying connective tissue and the microbial biofilm that accumulates on subgingival tooth surfaces (32). The permeability of the junctional epithelium is a result of the fact that the cells are interconnected by only a few desmosomes and occasional gap junctions, with only a few or no tight junctions (16). In this environment, local host- and microbe-derived pro-inflammatory factors, such as complement, cytokines (including interleukin-17), host or microbial proteases and microbial Toll-like receptor ligands (such as lipopolysaccharide), can be found at high concentrations (55, 58, 60, 94, 135, 151). In the environment of the gingival crevice, neutrophils constitute the overwhelming majority (>95%) of total infiltrating leukocytes (35).

Complement and interleukin-17 are both involved in the regulation of neutrophil recruitment, a process considered important for periodontal tissue homeostasis, although both excessive and diminished recruitment can precipitate periodontitis (32, 42, 59). Interleukin-17 can initiate neutrophil mobilization and recruitment by inducing the production of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (a primary regulator of both granulopoiesis and neutrophil release from the bone marrow) and CXC chemokines (CXCL1, 2, 5 and 8), which function as ligands of chemokine (C-X-C motif) receptor 2 (CXCR2) (152). CXCR2 is required for neutrophil extravasation into gingival tissues (161). Whereas transmigrating neutrophils initially utilize CXCR2 to follow the chemokine gradient deposited by the endothelium, they subsequently have to move toward a gradient existing in the infected or inflamed tissue. Such gradients could involve chemoattractants derived from bacteria (e.g. N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) or complement C5a fragments generated from local complement activation (88). In this regard, C5a receptor is abundantly expressed on neutrophils (126) and was shown to facilitate their recruitment to peripheral tissues (132). Interestingly, C5a-induced activation of the C5a receptor also contributes to the induction of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, at least in acute models of inflammation (14), although it is uncertain whether this function involves cooperation with interleukin-17.

Although normally tightly regulated (128), the complement system may become deregulated in a local niche, such as the gingival crevice, owing to a constant influx of microbial inflammatory molecules and the presence of periodontal bacteria that can subvert complement function (60, 64, 155). For instance, *Porphyromonas gingivalis*, a gram-negative bacterium strongly associated with human periodontitis (65), is very adept at subverting the complement system and has several mechanisms by which it can disrupt or hijack complement components, leading to immune evasion and destructive inflammation (60, 66, 125). Not only are complement activation fragments found in abundance in the gingival crevice fluid of patients with periodontitis, but their levels correlate with clinical parameters of the disease (28, 60, 133). Single nucleotide polymorphisms in the complement component C5 and interleukin-17 are suspected to predispose to periodontal disease, suggesting possible involvement of both molecules in its pathogenesis (22, 27, 84).

Although complement generally has complex effects on interleukin-17 expression that include both positive and negative regulation (1, 15, 93, 101, 107, 158), complement was shown to augment interleukin-17 production in murine periodontal tissue in cooperation with Toll-like receptors (1). Specifically, C5a-induced activation of the C5a receptor has been shown to synergize with Toll-like receptor-2 in a mouse model of periodontal disease to yield abundant increases of interleukin-17, interleukin-1beta, interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor that result in significant bone loss (1). Conversely, mice deficient in either C5a receptor or Toll-like receptor-2 are protected from experimental periodontitis (1, 66, 98).

### Interleukin-17 and neutrophil homeostasis

As alluded to above, interleukin-17 is important for neutrophil homeostasis, and consequently for peri-
odental health, because any deviation from normal neutrophil activity (in terms of numbers or activation status) can potentially cause periodontitis (32, 59). In fact, interleukin-17 is a key component of a neutrophil rheostat ('neutrostat') feedback mechanism that maintains steady-state neutrophil counts (139) (Fig. 4). Specifically, the neutrostat mechanism maintains a fine balance among granulopoiesis, release of mature neutrophils from the bone marrow into the circulation, extravasation of circulating neutrophils and clearance of apoptotic neutrophils (44, 139, 152). During infection or inflammation, innate immune cell-secreted interleukin-23 induces interleukin-17, which promotes granulopoiesis and mobilization of mature neutrophils from the bone marrow by acting through up-regulation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Neutrophils released from the bone marrow circulate in the blood and can extravasate into infected or inflamed tissues. Upon senescence, transmigrated neutrophils become apoptotic and are phagocytosed by tissue phagocytes, leading to suppression of interleukin-23 production, in turn, down-regulating the interleukin-17–granulocyte colony-stimulating factor axis for maintaining steady-state neutrophil counts (44, 139, 152) (Fig. 4). In a similar context, the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils associated with resolution of inflammation will signal the down-regulation of neutrophil production because neutrophils are no longer needed in great numbers.

Therefore, while granulocyte colony-stimulating factor is important for granulopoiesis, neutrophil recruitment into local tissues is equally important to maintain the neutrostat regulatory circuit and hence neutrophil homeostasis. This is best illustrated in disorders that disrupt the normal recruitment of neutrophils to peripheral tissues and thereby abrogate the regulatory signals for interleukin-23 and interleukin-17 expression, which are normally associated with apoptotic neutrophil phagocytosis. For instance, adhesion molecule-deficient mice [e.g. lacking beta2 (CD18) integrins] display blood neutrophilia and fail to recruit neutrophils in peripheral tissues (such as lungs and gut) where there is unrestrained expression of interleukin-17 (139). This homeostatic breakdown has recently been linked to interleukin-17-driven pathology in mouse models and in humans. Specifically, impaired neutrophil recruitment to the periodontal tissue of mice lacking either the lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (CD11a/CD18) integrin or CXCR2 leads to severe periodontal bone loss associated with over-expression of interleukin-17, whereas local treatment with anti-interleukin-17

Fig. 4. The neutrostat regulatory feedback loop. Interleukin-17 promotes granulopoiesis and mobilization of mature neutrophils from the bone marrow by acting through the up-regulation of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor. Upon release from the bone marrow, circulating neutrophils can normally extravasate into infected or inflamed tissues. Upon senescence, transmigrated neutrophils become apoptotic and are phagocytosed by tissue phagocytes, leading to suppression of their interleukin-23 production, in turn, down-regulating the interleukin-17–granulocyte colony-stimulating factor axis for maintaining steady-state neutrophil counts (139, 152). Disruption of this regulatory circuit in conditions that prevent the extravasation of neutrophils (e.g. leukocyte adhesion deficiency) leads to local overproduction of interleukin-17, which causes severe inflammation and periodontal bone loss (111). G-CSF, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor.

reverses the disease phenotype (111). Interestingly, anti-interleukin-17 treatment also reduced the periodontal bacterial load (111), apparently because periodontal bacteria rely on inflammation to secure critical nutrients, such as tissue breakdown products (peptides) and heme-containing compounds (65). Importantly, over-expression of interleukin-17 was also observed in the gingival tissue of patients with leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 (111). Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 is a disease syndrome caused by mutations on the CD18 subunit of β₂ integrins and is associated with frequent microbial infections and with aggressive periodontitis early in life (6, 34, 59, 67, 134). Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 periodontitis has been historically attributed to lack
of neutrophil surveillance of the periodontal infection. However, the recent demonstration that interleukin-17 is abnormally up-regulated in this condition, together with the demonstration that neutralization of interleukin-17 in relevant mouse models reverses both destructive inflammation and bacterial dysbiosis, suggests that leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1-associated periodontitis is fundamentally caused by a dysregulated host response featuring interleukin-17 overproduction.

It should be noted that the importance of neutrophil homeostasis for periodontal health is also emphatically evident in additional conditions associated with defects in mechanisms that regulate the production and life cycle of neutrophils (e.g. congenital neutropenia, Chediak–Higashi syndrome and Papillon–Lefèvre syndrome) (30, 34, 59, 69, 114). Although the underlying molecular mechanisms driving severe periodontitis in these patients are poorly understood, we hypothesize that an interleukin-17-driven mechanism might be relevant to any conditions associated with poor or no accumulation of neutrophils in extravascular sites, such as defective chemotaxis, as seen in the Chediak–Higashi syndrome (34, 59).

## Periodontal bacteria and interleukin-17

In the context of the neutrostat mechanism discussed above, CXCR2 was shown to regulate the interleukin-17–granulocyte colony-stimulating factor axis in the intestine in a bacteria-dependent manner (104). Although CXCL5 was shown to be the CXCR2 ligand that regulates the interleukin-17–granulocyte colony-stimulating factor axis in the intestine, the role of CXCL5 has not been explored in gingival tissues. However, commensal bacteria have been shown to induce CXCL2 and to contribute to neutrophil recruitment to gingival tissues (161). Whether the role played by CXCL2 in the periodontium is similar to that played by CXCL5 in the intestine, is not known at present.

Little is known regarding the mechanisms by which periodontal bacteria regulate interleukin-17 or interleukin-17-producing cells and such investigations could provide additional insight into the mechanisms of neutrophil recruitment and activation. Interestingly, T-helper 17 cells can contribute to neutrophil recruitment, not only through interleukin-17 production but also through their capacity to express CXCL8 (123). Conversely, recruited neutrophils can amplify the recruitment of T-helper 17 cells though the production of CCL2 and CCL20 chemokines, which are ligands, respectively, for chemokine CC-receptors 2 and 6 (CCR2 and CCR6, respectively) that are characteristically expressed by T-helper 17 cells (123). This apparent reciprocal relationship between neutrophils and T-helper 17 may have important implications in periodontal health or disease, by either reinforcing a protective immune response to control the periodontal bacteria or by amplifying a destructive inflammatory response.

As stated earlier, interleukin-17 is a key molecule in protection against extracellular bacteria and fungal pathogens (26, 115). The protective mechanisms involved include the ability of interleukin-17 not only to orchestrate neutrophil recruitment but also to stimulate the production of antimicrobial peptides from epithelial and other cell types, including beta-defensin-2, S100 proteins and cathelicidin (100, 115). In this context, interleukin-17 receptor signaling was associated with protection in a mouse model of periodontitis induced by implantation of a human periodontal pathogen (*P. gingivalis*) (160). In contrast, interleukin-17 receptor signaling was associated with protection against naturally occurring chronic bone loss in mice (42). In the latter model, genetic or aging-associated deficiency of Del-1, an endothelial cell-secreted glycoprotein that antagonizes the leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1 integrin (25, 63), leads to unrestrained neutrophil infiltration and interleukin-17-dependent bone loss (42). This apparent discrepancy might involve the different nature of the two models (chronic vs. a relatively acute periodontitis model). Although such an explanation is uncertain, chronic interleukin-17 receptor signaling can potentially turn an acute inflammatory response into chronic immunopathology, as in rheumatoid arthritis (102).

Although it is uncertain how periodontal bacteria may regulate interleukin-17 production, there is evidence suggesting that *P. gingivalis* promotes an interleukin-17 environment, ostensibly to exploit the resulting inflammatory response to obtain nutrients in the form of tissue-breakdown products and heme-containing molecules (63, 112, 116, 122). In this regard, stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy volunteers by *P. gingivalis* resulted in increased production of interleukin-17 in CD3⁺ T-cells and increased interleukin-23 production in macrophages (112). Moreover, lipopolysaccharide isolated from *P. gingivalis* was shown to induce production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-23 from human periodontal ligament cells (122), while its outer membrane proteins could stimulate expression ofinterleukin-17 mRNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients with gingivitis or periodontal disease (116). Remarkably, *P. gingivalis* appears to skew a T-helper 1 response toward T-helper 17, ostensibly to escape T-helper 1 cell-mediated immunity to which the organism appears to be susceptible (46, 49, 112). In part, the suppression of T-helper 1 cell-mediated immunity by *P. gingivalis* could be attributed to its ability to inhibit gingival epithelial cell production of T-helper 1-recruiting chemokines (81) as well as T-cell production of interferon-gamma (46). In general, *P. gingivalis* has an arsenal of virulence factors by which it can manipulate innate and adaptive immune cells to initiate a nutrient-rich inflammatory response orchestrated by interleukin-17. Importantly, the presence of *P. gingivalis* in the subgingival biofilm was associated with increased gingival crevice fluid levels of interleukin-17 in human periodontitis (135).

### Interleukin-17 and inflammatory bone loss

A persisting inflammatory environment can ultimately disrupt bone homeostasis, which depends on a triad of proteins within the tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor-receptor family, consisting of RANKL, its functional receptor (RANK) and its decoy receptor (osteoprotegerin) (17). These proteins are key factors for osteoclast differentiation and function: osteoclastogenesis is promoted by the binding of RANKL (expressed by osteoblasts as well as activated T-cells and B-cells) to RANK on osteoclast precursors, whereas osteoprotegerin restrains osteoclastogenesis by inhibiting the interaction of RANKL with RANK. However, the bone-protective effect of osteoprotegerin is diminished in periodontitis because the osteoprotegerin/RANKL ratio decreases with increasing periodontal inflammation (12).

Interleukin-17 has potent osteoclastogenic properties, in part because of its capacity to stimulate RANKL expression by osteoblasts and other stromal cells (91) (Fig. 3) and is therefore a focal point of interest in bone-related diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteoporosis and periodontal disease. Interleukin-17 can additionally induce the expression of matrix metalloproteinases in fibroblasts, endothelial cells and epithelial cells, thereby potentially mediating destruction of both connective tissue and the underlying bone (106). By expressing both interleukin-17 and RANKL, T-helper 17 cells can function as a dedicated osteoclastogenic subset that links T-cell activation to

inflammatory bone destruction (106). Most of the knowledge regarding T-helper 17 and interleukin-17 in bone-loss regulation comes from studies in rheumatoid arthritis. Periodontal disease has certain similarities to rheumatoid arthritis in that they both feature chronic inflammatory bone loss (33).

Interleukin-17 was also shown to enhance the survival and proliferation of human B cells and their differentiation into antibody-secreting plasma cells (38). In the bone-resorptive lesions of chronic periodontitis, B-cells/plasma cells are a major source of RANKL (85). This raises the possibility that the influence of interleukin-17 on B-cells and plasma cells may include bone-destructive effects, thereby contributing to the progression of periodontal disease. It could be argued that such deleterious effects could be offset by interleukin-17-mediated enhancement of the antibody response. However, the role of the antibody response in periodontitis remains unclear, although it is generally thought that naturally induced antibodies to periodontal bacteria are of low affinity and poor functionality (49).

The incidence of chronic inflammatory diseases appears to increase during the aging process (20, 51, 61). Mice also show a propensity for age-related periodontal disease, which correlates with increased production of interleukin-17 and elevated numbers of periodontal neutrophils (42). Intriguingly, neutrophils can induce osteoclastic bone resorption through the expression of membrane-bound RANKL (23), although whether this occurs in the periodontal tissue is uncertain. The increased production of interleukin-17 is inversely correlated with a decline of Del-1 expression in the periodontal tissue of old mice (42). The inverse relationship between interleukin-17 and Del-1 also characterizes human gingiva, with interleukin-17 and Del-1 dominating in inflamed and healthy gingiva, respectively (42). In this regard, interleukin-17 inhibits the expression of Del-1 in human endothelial cells (137) (Fig. 3); consistent with this, the neutralization of interleukin-17 in murine periodontal tissue leads to increased expression of Del-1, reduced neutrophil infiltration and diminished periodontal bone loss (42). These findings suggest that interleukin-17 biologics could, at least in principle, find application in the treatment of human periodontitis.

duced interleukin-17 compared with healthy peri- odontal tissue (3, 5, 7, 10, 11, 19, 40, 41, 75, 79, 82, 96, 112, 117, 118, 135, 144, 151, 162) (Table 1). Moreover, a single nucleotide polymorphism associated with increased expression of interleukin-17 was found to be more prevalent in patients with chronic periodontitis than in control subjects (27). Carriers of the interleukin-17G197A allele showed increased expression of interleukin-17 and CXCL8, correlating with worse clinical periodontal parameters, but increased myeloperoxidase activity, compared with individuals with the GG genotype (27). Although very important, these studies by themselves do not formally establish a causal role for interleukin-17 in periodontitis. However, taken together with the pro-inflammatory and osteoclastogenic properties of interleukin-17 and intervention studies in mouse models discussed above, it is reasonable to suspect that interleukin-17 is an important player in periodontal immunopathology.

It is currently uncertain whether the chronic nature of periodontitis represents a constant pathologic process or a persistent series of brief acute insults (bursts) (54). In the context of the burst model, it is tempting to speculate that interleukin-17-producing cells with inflammatory or regulatory functions (see above) might be involved in the mechanisms by which 'inflammatory bursts' could occur. In view of the plasticity by which regulatory T-cells can convert into interleukin-17-producing (T-helper 17) cells, a recent study has identified interleukin-17+/FOXP3+

double-positive cells in human periodontal lesions, which is suggestive of an intermediate T-cell stage in this process (118). This conversion may be facilitated by the presence of interleukin-23 in the periodontal tissue, which was shown to restrain regulatory T-cell development in favor of effector T-helper 17 cells (124). Moreover, interleukin-23 can induce the clonal expansion of T-helper 17 cells and stimulate their production of interleukin-17 (156). In this regard, a recent study has shown that the number of interleukin-23-expressing macrophages correlated positively with both inflammation and the abundance of interleukin-17-expressing T-cells, which was the predominant T-cell subset in the lesions (5).

### Conclusion and perspectives

Interleukin-17 plays a central role in innate immunity, inflammation and osteoclastogenesis, and links T-cell activation to neutrophil mobilization and activation. Although it is likely that interleukin-17 exerts both protective and destructive effects in periodontitis, the burden of evidence from human and animal model studies suggests that the net effect of interleukin-17 signaling leads to disease. However, in the absence of definitive clinical evidence (i.e. anti-interleukin-17 intervention in human periodontitis), this notion remains a plausible, but unproven, hypothesis. Several interleukin-17 inhibitors (e.g. the

anti-interleukin-17A monoclonal antibodies secukinumab and ixekizumab, and the anti-interleukin-17RA monoclonal antibody brodalumab) have been tested in clinical trials for other diseases and encouraging results have been obtained in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis, despite occasional adverse effects involving mostly fungal infections (8, 24, 50, 78, 86, 106). As systemic treatment with interleukin-17 blockers is generally well tolerated, local treatment for local inflammatory diseases, such as periodontitis, should present increased safety. As such clinical trials have not yet been undertaken, it would be interesting to know the impact of ongoing systemic therapies with interleukin-17 inhibitors on a relatively common disease such as periodontitis. Systemic anti-interleukin-17 intervention, as already performed for rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and psoriasis (8, 24, 50, 78, 86, 106), could potentially shed light on the true effects of interleukin-17 responses in human periodontitis.
