Incubations of [8(R)-²H]9(S)-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid, [14(R)-²H]13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid and [14(S)-²H]13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid were performed with preparations of plant tissues containing divinyl ether synthases. In agreement with previous studies, generation of colneleic acid from the 8(R)-deuterated 9(S)-hydroperoxide was accompanied by loss of most of the deuterium label (retention, 8%), however, the opposite result (98% retention) was observed in the generation of 8(Z)-colneleic acid from the same hydroperoxide. Formation of etheroleic acid and 11(Z)-etheroleic acid from the 14(R)-deuterated 13(S)-hydroperoxide was accompanied by loss of most of the deuterium (retention, 7–8%), and, as expected, biosynthesis of these divinyl ethers from the corresponding 14(S)-deuterated hydroperoxide was accompanied by retention of deuterium (retention, 94–98%). Biosynthesis of ω5(Z)-etheroleic acid from the 14(R)- and 14(S)-deuterated 13(S)-hydroperoxides showed the opposite results, i.e. 98% retention and 4% retention, respectively. The experiments demonstrated that biosynthesis of divinyl ether fatty acids from linoleic acid 9- and 13-hydroperoxides takes place by a mechanism that involves stereospecific abstraction of one of the two hydrogen atoms α to the hydroperoxide carbon. Furthermore, a consistent relationship between the absolute configuration of the hydrogen atom eliminated (R or S) and the configuration of the introduced vinyl ether double bond (E or Z) emerged from these results. Thus, irrespective of which hydroperoxide regioisomer served as the substrate, divinyl ether synthases abstracting the pro-R hydrogen generated divinyl ethers having an E vinyl ether double bond, whereas enzymes abstracting the pro-S hydrogen produced divinyl ethers having a Z vinyl ether double bond.

Fatty acid hydroperoxides generated in plant tissues by lipoxygenases or α-dioxygenases are subject to secondary modification by several enzymes [1]. One branch of hydroperoxide metabolism involves formation of divinyl ether derivatives by carbon-carbon bond cleavage catalyzed by specific divinyl ether synthases. This type of transformation was first described in 1972 by Galliard and Phillips, who found that extracts of potato tuber catalyzed the conversion of linoleic acid 9(S)-hydroperoxide (9(S)-HPOD) into a divinyl ether they named colneleic acid [2]. More recent work has demonstrated that the divinyl ether synthase producing colneleic acid and the related colnelenic acid is induced in plant leaves during attack by fungal pathogens [3,4], and that divinyl ether fatty acids inhibit mycelial growth and spore germination in certain fungi.

[3,5]. Further research stimulated by these findings has resulted in the cloning of genes encoding divinyl ether synthases in tomato and potato and in the identification of these enzymes as cytochrome P-450 proteins [4,6].

The divinyl ether synthase-catalyzed formation of colneleic acid from 9(S)-hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid in homogenate of potato tuber is believed to take place via an enzyme-bound epoxide carbocation [7–10]. Studies using stereospecifically deuterated substrate have shown that the double bond-forming step in the biosynthesis of colneleic acid involves stereoselective removal of the pro-R hydrogen from C8 [8]. Several new divinyl ether synthases in addition to the colneleic acid-forming enzyme have been discovered during the last decade [11–14], and the aim of this study was to determine the stereospecificities of these additional enzymes using hydroperoxides stereospecifically deuterated at the appropriate carbon atoms.

## Results

### Stereospecifically deuterated fatty acids and hydroperoxides

Stereospecifically deuterated stearates were synthesized starting with 8- or 14-hydroxystearates of high optical purity. Deuterium was introduced by reduction of the corresponding p-toluenesulfonates with lithium aluminum deuteride, a reaction that takes place with clean inversion of configuration [15] (Fig. 1). The deuterated stearates were converted to the corresponding linoleates by exposure to growing cultures of the flagellate *Tetrahymena pyriformis*. This biological desaturation proceeds without significant degradation of the carbon chain and without migration of the isotope [16], however, considerable dilution with unlabeled material took place. Incubation of the deuterated linoleates with soybean lipoxygenase or tomato lipoxygenase resulted in deuterated 13(S)-HPOD and 9(S)-HPOD, respectively, which had a deuterium content of 34–49% (Table 1).

leaves of the plant *Clematis vitalba* [14]. Interestingly, biosynthesis of this compound from [8(R)-²H]9(S)-HPOD took place with retention of the deuterium label, i.e., a result opposite to that observed in the biosynthesis of colneleic acid (Table 1, Fig. 2).

### Stereospecificity of hydrogen eliminations from C8 in the biosynthesis of colneleic acid isomers

It has been shown previously that biosynthesis of colneleic acid from 9(S)-HPOD catalyzed by divinyl ether synthase in potato tuber is accompanied by stereoselective loss of the pro-R hydrogen from C8 [8]. This result was confirmed here (Table 1). An isomer of colneleic acid, i.e., 8(Z)-colneleic acid, was recently isolated from

### Stereospecificity of hydrogen eliminations from C14 in the biosynthesis of etheroleic acid isomers

In the biosynthesis of etheroleic acid and its two isomers, i.e., ω5(Z)-etheroleic acid and 11(Z)-etheroleic acid, one hydrogen is lost from C14. As seen in Table 1, these conversions also took place with stereospecific hydrogen removals. In the case of etheroleic acid (garlic) and 11(Z)-etheroleic acid (*Ranunculus*

or tritiated precursors have generated important information on enzyme-catalyzed reactions. In addition to providing insights into reaction mechanisms, results obtained with specifically labeled substrates have been useful in molecular modeling studies of enzyme-substrate complexes. An example from the oxylipin/eicosanoid field is the use of precursor acids labeled with tritium in the 13(R) or 13(S) positions to elucidate the stereochemistry and mechanism of the cyclooxygenase reaction leading to prostaglandins [16], and the use of this knowledge for establishing the productive conformation of the arachidonic acid molecule bound to the active site of the cyclooxygenase enzyme [18].

Divinyl ether synthases are cytochrome P-450 enzymes [4,6] and related to other (hydro)peroxide-metabolizing P-450s such as allene oxide synthase [19], hydroperoxide lyase [20,21], thromboxane synthase [22] and prostacyclin synthase [22]. In the case of divinyl ether biosynthesis, the initial step is believed to consist of cleavage of the O-O bond of the hydroperoxide to provide an alkoxy radical, which undergoes cyclization and one-electron oxidation into an epoxide carbocation [23]. Enzyme-assisted removal of a proton α to the epoxide group and cleavage of the carbon-carbon single bond of the epoxide group provides the final divinyl ether structure (Fig. 3). The nature of the hydrogen-abtracting group in divinyl ether synthases is unknown but may be either a basic amino acid residue [7] or the strongly basic Fe³⁺-OH group of the P-450 heme [23].

This study confirms and extends previous work on the divinyl ether synthase class of cytochrome P-450s by showing that removal of one of the two hydrogens α to the hydroperoxide group invariably takes place in a stereospecific way (Fig. 2). Furthermore, inspection of the data given in Table 1 and Fig. 2

lingua) an essentially complete loss of isotope was noted with the 14(R)-deuterated precursor, whereas incubation of the 14(S)-deuterated precursor afforded products that retained most of the deuterium label. The opposite labeling pattern was observed in the biosynthesis of ω5(Z)-etheroleic acid (Ranunculus acris), i.e. stereospecific removal of the pro-S hydrogen and retention of the pro-R hydrogen (Table 1, Fig. 2).

## Discussion

Since the pioneering work by Schroepfer and Bloch on the stereochemistry of the desaturation of stearate into oleate [17], studies using stereospecifically deuterated

reveals an interesting correlation, i.e. biosynthesis of divinyl ethers having the \( E \) configuration of the newly created vinyl ether double bond (colneleic acid, ethero-leic acid and 11(Z)-etheroleic acid) takes place with stereoselective loss of the pro- \( R \) hydrogen, whereas the Z vinyl ethers (8(Z)-colneleic acid and ω5(Z)-etheroleic acid) are formed in a process which involves loss of the pro- \( S \) hydrogen. These results can be interpreted in terms of the conformations of the carbon–carbon single bond α to the epoxide of the epoxide carbocation intermediate, i.e. transoid and cisoid conformations are needed to produce \( E \) and \( Z \) vinyl ether double bonds, respectively (Fig. 4). As seen from this model, irrespective of the detailed structure of the surrounding active site, rotation of the carbon–carbon single bond to produce the two conformations moves either the pro- \( R \) or pro- \( S \) hydrogen in contact with the same region of the active site. This may be taken to suggest that the positioning of the hydrogen-abstracting group relative to the bound substrate is highly conserved in all divinyl ether synthases of higher plants. The stereochemical data also show that the hydrogen eliminated consistently has a syn relationship to the vicinal oxygen atom (Fig. 4). This stereochemistry is in agreement with the notion [23] that the heme iron not only participates in the hydroperoxidase reaction but also serves as the hydrogen-abstracting group. Further interpretation of the stereochemical data presented must await

# Experimental procedures

## Plant materials

Specimens of *Ranunculus acris* L., *Ranunculus lingua* L. and *Clematis vitalba* L. were obtained as described previously [12–14]. Leaves were either used directly or shock-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C until use. Tubers of potato (var. Bintje) and bulbs of garlic were obtained from a local market.

## Stereospecifically deuterated hydroperoxides

### [8(R)-²H]9(S)-Hydroperoxy-10(E),12(Z)-octadecadienoic acid

9(S)-HPOD stereospecifically labeled with deuterium in the 8(R) position was prepared via [8(S)-²H]stearic acid (25 mg) and [8(R)-²H]linoleic acid as described previously [8]. An aliquot of the hydroperoxide was reduced by treatment with sodium borohydride in methanol at 0 °C, and the methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative of the resulting hydroxide was analyzed by GC/MS. The isotopic composition of the sample was 48.8% monodeuterated and 51.2% undeuterated molecules as determined by mass spectrometric analysis of the fragment [CH₃OOC-(CH₂)₇-(CH = CH)₂-CH = O⁺SiMe₃] (m/z 311 and 312 in the undeuterated and deuterated derivatives, respectively). As expected from the localization of the deuterium atom at C8, the fragment [(CH = CH)₂-CH(OSiMe₃)-(CH₂)₄-CH₃]⁺ (m/z 225) was devoid of deuterium.

### 3(R,S)-Hydroxyheptanoic acid

Methyl 3-oxoheptanoate (39.5 g; 0.25 mmol; Fluka Chemie GmbH, Buchs, Switzerland) was dissolved in methanol (250 mL) and sodium borohydride (4 g) was added at 0 °C over a period of 3 h under magnetic stirring. Subsequently, a solution of sodium hydroxide (12 g) in water (100 mL) was added and the mixture was stirred for 15 h at 23 °C. Extraction with diethyl ether provided 3(R,S)-hydroxyheptanoic acid (36.1 g; 99%) as a colorless viscous oil which slowly solidified at room temperature. The purity as checked by GC/MS analysis of the methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative was > 95%.

### 3(R)-Hydroxyheptanoic acid

3(R,S)-Hydroxyheptanoic acid (14.6 g, 0.1 mmol) and cinchonidine (29.4 g, 0.1 mmol) in carbon tetrachloride (1 L) was heated on a boiling water bath for 3 min and then allowed to cool to room temperature. The crystalline

mass that separated was collected on a Büchner funnel and redissolved in CCl₄ (700 mL). The solution was left overnight at 23 °C and the crystals formed (≈ 20 g) were again subjected to crystallization from CCl₄. After six such crystallizations, rosette-formed crystals (2.5 g) of the cinchonidine salt of 3(R)-hydroxyheptanoic acid were obtained. Regeneration of the acid by acidification and extraction with diethyl ether provided 3(R)-hydroxyheptanoic acid (0.73 g; yield, 10% of the theoretical) having [α]D²³ = –23.3° (c 2.5, chloroform); earlier published for 3(R)-hydroxyhexanoic acid, [α]D = –28° [24] and for 3(R)-hydroxyoctanoic acid, [α]D = –21° [25]. An aliquot was esterified with diazomethane and converted to its 2(S)-phenylpropionyl derivative [26]. Analysis by GLC showed an enantiomeric composition of >98% 3(R)- and <2% 3(S)-hydroxyheptanoic acid.

### Methyl 14(R)-hydroxystearate

3(R)-Hydroxyheptanoic acid (438 mg, 3 mmol) was refluxed for 15 min with acetyl chloride (20 mL). The residue obtained following evaporation of the reagent was dissolved in acetone (20 mL), and water (13.3 mL) was added under magnetic stirring. After 5 h at 23 °C, the solution was extracted providing essentially pure 3(R)-acetoxyheptanoic acid. This material was dissolved in methanol (100 mL) containing methyl hydrogen tridecane-1,13-dioate (5.16 g, 20 mmol) and sodium methoxide (1.2 mmol). The solution was transferred to an electrolysis cell and a current of 1.8 A was passed through for 2 h. The resulting product was saponified, esterified by treatment with diazomethane, and subjected to silicic acid open column chromatography. Elution with diethyl ether/hexane (20 : 80, v/v) afforded methyl 14(R)-hydroxyoctadecanoate (299 mg; yield, 32%). Analysis by GC/MS showed a single peak (purity, >96%) on which a mass spectrum showing the following prominent ions was recorded: *m/z* 296 (*M*⁺ – 18; loss of H₂O), 283 (*M*⁺ – 31; loss of OCH₃), 257 (*M*⁺ – 57; loss of (CH₂)₃–CH₃), 225 (257–32; loss of CH₃OH), 185, 143, 87, and 69.

### Methyl 14(R)-p-toluenesulfonyloxystearate

Methyl 14(R)-hydroxystearate (157 mg, 0.5 mmol) was dissolved in dry pyridine (4 mL), cooled to –25 °C and treated with *p*-toluenesulfonyl chloride (400 mg). After 12 h at –25 °C and 48 h at +4 °C, water was added and the solution was extracted with diethyl ether. Purification by open column silicic acid chromatography afforded methyl 14(R)-*p*-toluenesulfonyloxystearate (200 mg, yield, 86%).

### [14(S)-²H]Stearic acid

(300 mg; 98 atom percentage deuterium; purchased from Sigma-Aldrich) in dry tetrahydrofuran (25 mL) for 18 h. The resulting octadecanol was dissolved in 6 mL of acetone and treated with 0.63 mL of Jones’ reagent at 23 °C for 30 min. The product was purified by open column silicic acid chromatography to afford [14(S)-²H]stearic acid (44 mg, yield, 74%). Analysis of an aliquot (methyl ester) by GC/MS showed a single peak. The mass spectrum showed the following prominent ions: *m/z* 299 (*M*⁺), 256 (*M*⁺ – 43; loss of C₃H₇), 200 (*M*⁺ – 99; loss of C₇H₁₅), 143, 87, and 74.

### [14(S)-²H]Linoleic acid

A culture of *Tetrahymena pyriformis* strain phenoset A (American Type Culture Collection #30327; Manassas, VA, USA) was added to culture medium (400 mL) consisting of glucose (0.5%, w/v), yeast extract (0.5%, w/v) and peptone (0.5%, w/v) in 0.004 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 and containing the sodium salt of [14(S)-²H]stearic acid (10 mg). The mixture was incubated under continuous shaking at 32 °C for 92 h [8]. The cell pellet collected by centrifugation was suspended in 50% aqueous methanol (100 mL) containing sodium hydroxide (7 g) and the mixture was refluxed under an atmosphere of argon for 90 min. The isolated mixed fatty acids (≈ 9 mg) were subjected to semipreparative RP-HPLC using a column of Nucleosil C₁₈ 100-7 (250 × 10 mm) purchased from Macherey-Nagel (Düren, Germany) and a solvent system of acetonitrile/water/acetic acid (800 : 200 : 0.1, v/v/v) at 3 mL·min⁻¹. [14(S)-²H]Linoleic acid (2 mg) was collected at 68–72 mL effluent. The mass spectrum of the methyl ester of this material showed molecular ions at *m/z* 294 and 295 corresponding to undeuterated and monodeuterated molecules, respectively (ratio, 0.51), the undeuterated linoleate being derived from the organism used to carry out the desaturation.

### [14(S)-²H]13(S)-Hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid

[14(S)-²H]Linoleic acid (1.9 mg) was stirred for 10 min at 0 °C in 0.1 M sodium borate buffer pH 10.4 containing soybean lipoxygenase (soybean lipoxygenase type IV purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, 15 μL). Material isolated by extraction with diethyl ether was purified by silicic acid open column chromatography to provide 1.7 mg (yield, 80%) of the title compound showing λmax (EtOH) = 233 nm. An aliquot was reduced with NaBH₄ in methanol at 0 °C and the resulting deuterated 13-hydroxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoate was analyzed as the methyl ester/Me₃Si derivative by GC/MS using selected ion monitoring of the mass spectral ions due to the fragment [(CH = CH)₂-CH(OSiMe₃)-(CH₂)₄-CH₃]⁺ (*m/z* 225 and 226 in undeuterated and
deuterated hydroxides, respectively). The isotopic composition found after correction for the natural abundance of the \( m/z \) 226 ion was 33.9% monodeuterated and 66.1% undeuterated molecules. As expected from the localization of the deuterium label at C14, the fragment \(\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OOC}-\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{7}\left(\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{CH}\right)_{2}-\mathrm{CH}=\mathrm{O}^{+} \mathrm{SiMe}_{3}\) was undeuterated and gave rise to an ion at \( m/z \) 311 with insignificant enrichment of \( m/z \) 312.

### [14(R)-²H]Stearic acid

Methyl 14(R)-\( p \)-toluenesulfonyloxystearate (100 mg, 0.21 mmol) was dissolved in acetic acid (7 mL) containing sodium acetate (50 mg) and the mixture was kept at \( 60^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) for 17 h. The product was saponified by refluxing with 10% NaOH in 80% aqueous methanol for 90 min and then esterified by treatment with diazomethane and treated with \( p \)-toluenesulfonyl chloride in pyridine as described above. Reduction with lithium aluminium deuteride followed by Jones oxidation and silicic acid open column chromatography afforded [14(R)-²H]stearic acid (22 mg; yield, 37%) (Fig. 1).

### [14(R)-²H]Linoleic acid

[14(R)-²H]Stearic acid (22 mg) was incubated with *Tetrahymena pyriformis* as described above and the free fatty acids subjected to RP-HPLC to provide [14(R)-²H]linoleic acid (4 mg; ratio of labeled/unlabeled molecules, 0.62).

### [14(R)-²H]13(S)-Hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid

[14(R)-²H]Linoleic acid (4 mg) was incubated with soybean lipoxygenase as described above. Following purification by silicic acid open column chromatography, [14(R)-²H]13(S)-hydroperoxy-9(Z),11(E)-octadecadienoic acid (3 mg) was obtained. The isotopic composition as determined by GC/MS analysis of the methyl ester/\(\mathrm{Me}_{3} \mathrm{Si}\) derivative of the reduced compound was 38.3% monodeuterated and 61.7% undeuterated molecules.

### Enzyme preparations

The following divinyl ether synthase preparations were used for study of the biosynthesis of the divinyl ethers indicated.

#### Colneleic acid

Tubers of potato were sliced and homogenized at \( 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) in 0.1 M borate buffer pH 9.0 (2 : 1, v/w) using an Ultra-Turrax. The homogenate was filtered through gauze and centrifuged at 9300 g for 15 min. Further centrifugation at 105 000 g provided a particulate fraction which was resuspended in borate buffer (half the volume compared with the corresponding 105 000 g supernatant) [8].

#### Etheroleic acid

Bulbs of garlic were sliced and homogenized at \( 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 (2 : 1, v/w). The homogenate was filtered through gauze and successively centrifuged at 1100 g for 15 min and 105 000 g to provide a particulate fraction which was resuspended in phosphate buffer (half the volume compared with the corresponding 105 000 g supernatant) [11].

#### ω5(Z)-Etheroleic acid

Leaves of *Ranunculus acris* were minced and homogenized at \( 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.7 (5 : 1, v/w; buffer supplemented with 235 μM of salicylhydroxamic acid as an lipoxygenase inhibitor). The filtered homogenate was centrifuged at 1100 g for 15 min, and further centrifugation of the supernatant at 105 000 g provided a particulate fraction that was resuspended in phosphate buffer (half the volume compared with the corresponding supernatant) [12].

#### 11(Z)-Etheroleic acid

Leaves of *Ranunculus lingua* were treated in the same way as described for *Ranunculus acris* [13].

#### 8(Z)-Colneleic acid

Leaves of *Clematis vitalba* were homogenized at \( 0^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) in potassium phosphate buffer pH 6.7 (5 : 1, v/w) and the homogenate was filtered through gauze [14].

Suspensions of the particulate fractions of homogenates of garlic, *R. acris* or *R. lingua* (2–20 mL) were stirred at \( 23^{\circ} \mathrm{C} \) for 20 min with 300 μM [14(R)-²H]- or [14(S)-²H]-HPOD. In the same way, filtered homogenates of *C. vitalba* (45 mL) or suspensions of the 105 000 g fraction of potato tuber homogenate were stirred with 300 μM [8(R)-²H]9(S)-HPOD. Material obtained after extraction with diethyl ether was subjected to solid-phase extraction using an amino-propyl column (0.5 g; Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA) [12]. Material eluted with diethyl ether/acetic acid (98 : 2, v/v) was esterified by treatment with diazomethane and subjected to RP-HPLC using a column of Nucleosil C₁₈ 100–7 (250 × 10 mm) and a solvent system of acetonitrile/water (80 : 20, v/v) at a flow rate of 4 mL·min⁻¹. The effluent was led to a Bischoff model DAD-100 diode-array detector (Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany), and divinyl
ethers localized by their strong absorption at 250–253 nm were collected, esterified, and analyzed for deuterium content by GC/MS. Blank incubations were performed in which the divinyl ether synthase preparations were incubated in the absence of hydroperoxide and subsequently carried through the whole sequence. In the case of the enzyme preparation obtained from garlic bulbs, significant amounts of endogenous etheroleic acid were detected, i.e. 3–4% of the levels achieved in incubations carried out in the presence of added 13(S)-HPOD. The isotopic compositions of etheroleic acid biosynthesized from deuterated precursors using this enzyme preparation were corrected for the dilution caused by this endogenous material. By contrast, no significant occurrence of endogenous divinyl ethers was detected in the other four preparations.

### GC/MS

GC/MS was carried out with a Hewlett-Packard model 5970B mass-selective detector connected to a Hewlett-Packard model 5890 gas chromatograph equipped with a capillary column of 5% phenylmethylsiloxane (12 m, 0.33 μm film thickness). Helium was used as the carrier gas, and the column temperature was raised at 10 °C·min⁻¹ from 120 to 260 °C. Isotopic composition of analytes were determined using the selected ion monitoring mode and the following mass spectral ions: *m/z* 225 and 226 (undeuterated and monodeuterated [14-²H]13(S)-HPOD; reduced, methyl esterified and trimethylsilylated), *m/z* 311 and 312 ([8-²H]9(S)-HPOD; reduced, methyl esterified and trimethylsilylated), and *m/z* 308 and 309 (methyl esters of divinyl ether fatty acids).
