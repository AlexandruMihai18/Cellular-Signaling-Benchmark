**Abstract** Lipoate is a covalently bound cofactor essential for five redox reactions in humans: in four 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the glycine cleavage system (GCS). Two enzymes are from the energy metabolism, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase; and three are from the amino acid metabolism, branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase, 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase, and the GCS. All these enzymes consist of multiple subunits and share a similar architecture. Lipoate synthesis in mitochondria involves mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis up to octanoyl-acyl-carrier protein; and three lipoate-specific steps, including octanoic acid transfer to glycine cleavage H protein by lipoyl(octanoyl) transferase 2 (putative) (LIPT2), lipoate synthesis by lipoic acid synthetase (LIAS), and lipoate transfer by lipoyltransferase 1 (LIPT1), which is necessary to lipoylate the E2 subunits of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. The reduced form dihydrolipoate is reactivated by dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD). Mutations in LIAS have been identified that result in a variant form of nonketotic hyperglycinemia with early-onset convulsions combined with a defect in mitochondrial energy metabolism with encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy. LIPT1 deficiency spares the GCS, and resulted in a combined 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase deficiency and early death in one patient and in a less severely affected individual with a Leigh-like phenotype. As LIAS is an iron–sulphur-cluster-dependent enzyme, a number of recently identified defects in mitochondrial iron–sulphur cluster synthesis, including NFU1, BOLA3, IBA57, GLRX5 presented with deficiency of LIAS and a LIAS-like phenotype. As in DLD deficiency, a broader clinical spectrum can be anticipated for lipoate synthesis defects depending on which of the affected enzymes is most rate limiting.

Lipoic acid is a covalently bound cofactor in mitochondria

Lipoic acid (LA), or 6,8-dithiooctanoic acid [International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) name (R)-5-(1,2-dithiolan-3-yl)pentanoic acid] is an essential cofactor for several cellular redox reactions and is found in all kingdoms of life. The hydrophobic cofactor LA appears in an oxidized form with a ring-shaped intramolecular disulfide bond, an intermediate form with sulphur-bound substrate, and a reduced form that contains two sulfhydryls. Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase (DLD) catalyzes regeneration of the oxidized form by reacting with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺) and formation of NADH (Fig. 1). In humans, as in other eukaryotes, LA is exclusively found in mitochondria, where it must be synthesized de novo.

LA was first identified by Lester Reed and colleagues (Reed et al 1951), who worked at the University of Texas on identifying the acetate-replacing factor, a substance that restored growth on pyruvate in a mutant strain of *Streptococcus faecalis*. The authors extracted 30 mg of a crystalline substance from 10 tons of water-insoluble residue from bovine liver. They called this substance lipoic acid. During following studies, it was determined that the underlying defective reaction in this bacterium was pyruvate dehydrogenase. It took several decades to unravel the complicated composition,

Dihydrolipoamide

Fig. 1 The lipoic acid (LA) cofactor is covalently bound to protein via an amide bond (lipoamide) to the ε-amino group of a lysine in a conserved lipoylation domain. The oxidized form is ready for reaction with different substrates and forms an intermediate until the substrate is released and the reduced form with two sulfhydryls (dihydrolipoamide) is generated. DLD catalyzes the reactivation of the cofactor by a redox reaction with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD⁺).

molecular structure, and regulation of this enzyme complex (Reed 2001).

LA is covalently bound via an amide bond as a prosthetic group of the E2 subunits of distinct but structurally related 2-oxoacid (α-ketoacid) dehydrogenases in mitochondria but also of the H protein of the glycine cleavage system (GCS), which is also localized within mitochondria in eukaryotes. Furthermore, LA was found in the E3-binding protein of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC). LA is covalently attached to the ε-amino group of a conserved lysine, which lies within a lipoylation domain. This domain is conserved within the H protein of the GCS and is related to but slightly distinct in E2 subunits of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. The latter domain is also found as a motive for biotinylation. Biotin is structurally related to LA and is also a hydrophobic-sulphur-containing carbon acid. In contrast to other lipoylated proteins in humans, the E2 subunit of the PDHC contains two lipoylation domains.

**Lipoic-acid-dependent reactions in the cell**

In humans, six proteins that participate in five different enzymatic reactions are known to be modified by the cofactor LA. Four of these five reactions are 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (Fig. 2). These four reactions share a similar structure and mechanism and have three enzymatic steps: E1, a thiamine-dependent decarboxylase; E2, the lipoylated subunit with dihydrolipoamide S-acyltransferase activity, which reacts with coenzyme A (CoA); and the flavoprotein E3, the DLD, which reacts with dihydrolipoamide and NAD⁺. The chemical reactions in the GCS are in some respect distinct to the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases: The first reaction is a decarboxylation by the P protein, which uses pyridoxal phosphate as a cofactor; the aminomethyl moiety is then transferred to the lipoamide residue of the H protein. Next, the T protein degrades the lipoyl-bound aminomethyl residue to N⁵,N¹⁰-methylene-tetrahydrofolate and ammonia. Finally, the L protein, a DLD, reacts with dihydrolipoamide and NAD⁺ to recycle the lipoamide moiety. The nature of the L protein, DLD, of the GCS is still a matter of debate; it has not been elucidated if this function is covered by the known E3 subunit of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases or if there is another, thus far uncharacterized, enzyme that is, at least in part, relevant for this reaction. The latter is supported by the fact that patients with severe deficiency of the E3 subunit have a normal GCS function, and two immunologically distinct DLD isoforms have been reported in rat liver (Carothers et al 1987). In contrast to the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase reactions, which are irreversible, GCS functions in both directions.

**Metabolic relevance of lipoic-acid-dependent reactions**

As summarized in Table 1, the five LA-dependent reactions play a substantial role in energy and amino acid metabolism. All these enzymes consist of multiple subunits and share a common architecture. Defects in 16 genes encoding either subunits of these enzymes or in regulating the PDHC and branched-chain ketoacid dehydrogenase (BCKDH) have been reported (Table 1). For details on clinical presentation, we refer to OMIM entries (cf. Table 1). The pathophysiology of these defects is either closely connected with the lack of energy provision in PDHC and α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (α-KGDH) deficiency or with elevated neurotoxic metabolites, as found in BCKDH deficiency, with leucine elevation [maple syrup urine disease (MSUD), MIM248600], and in GCS deficiency, with glycine elevation [nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH), MIM605899]. Glycine acts as an inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitter, and deficiency of the GCS often leads to intractable seizures (Bowery and Smart 2006).

The recently reported 2-oxoadipic dehydrogenase deficiency seems to be associated with a rather mild psychomotor delay in autosomal recessive patients (Danhauser et al 2012) but was also found in association with Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 in heterozygous patients from a Chinese pedigree (Xu et al 2012). The occurrence of symptoms in this deficiency may be due to selection bias, as individuals with this enzyme deficiency can remain completely asymptomatic (Goodman and Frerman 1995; Peng et al 1999).

### Synthesis of lipoic acid in mitochondria

LA is formed in mitochondria by a series of reactions involving mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis type II (FAS II), transfer of the octanoyl group to a first-acceptor protein (glycine cleavage H protein), lipoate synthesis by transfer of two sulfhydryl groups to the apolar side chain of the bound octanoic acid, and a final transfer from the H protein to other lipoylated proteins: the E2 subunits of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (Fig. 3). LA synthesis has been intensively studied in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* (Hiltunen et al 2010). For most but not all of the involved enzymatic reactions, orthologues have been identified in humans. However, some of these reactions have been poorly characterized, and there are still some open questions.

### Fatty acid synthesis in mitochondria

The major part of fatty acid synthesis is located in the cytosol and catalyzed by the combination of two enzymes: an acetyl-CoA carboxylase, and a multifunctional fatty acid synthetase. Mitochondria are well known for fatty acid catabolism by beta-oxidation, which is a major route for cellular energy provision. In addition, mitochondria possess their own apparatus for fatty acid synthesis, which is completely distinct from the cytosolic pathway and related to bacterial fatty acid synthesis. The function of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis is still a matter of debate, at least, formation

of acyl-carrier-protein (ACP)-bound octanoic acid is necessary for LA synthesis (Fig. 3):

1. The first step in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis is the formation of malonyl-CoA. In yeast, this step is catalyzed by a biotin-dependent acetyl-CoA carboxylase encoded by *HFA1* (Hoja et al 2004); however, in humans, no ortholog could be identified. A distinct enzymatic step catalyzed by malonyl-CoA synthetase, encoded by the *ACSF3* gene, was identified (Witkowski et al 2011). A knockdown of this gene resulted in reduced malonyl-CoA content in mitochondria; however, there was no deficiency of LA synthesis, which could be due to an alternative source of malonyl-CoA.
   
2. Malonyl-CoA is then transferred to the prosthetic phosphopantetheine group of the mitochondrial ACP, encoded by *NDUFAB1*. Remarkably, NDUFAB1 is also found as a subunit of respiratory chain complex I. This transfer reaction is catalyzed by malonyl-CoA:acyl-carrier protein acyltransferase, encoded by *MCAT* (Zhang et al 2003).

3. Malonyl-ACP is further metabolized to 3-ketoacyl-ACP by 3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase, encoded by *OXSM*. The human enzyme can elongate acyl-chains containing 2–14 carbon atoms with malonyl moieties attached in thioester linkage to the human mitochondrial ACP and is able to restore growth in the respiratory-deficient yeast *cem1* mutant, which encodes the

orthologous enzyme (Zhang et al 2005). It is still unclear whether the first step needs acetyl-ACP and how this substance is produced.

4. Then, 3-ketoacyl-ACP is reduced to 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP by 3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase. This enzyme activity was found to be catalyzed by a heterotetramer of HSD17B8 and CBR4 (Chen et al 2009), in contrast to yeast, which contains a single enzyme, encoded by OAR1.

5. The 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP is further metabolized to 2-trans-enoyl-ACP by 3-hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase, encoded by HTD2 in yeast (Kastaniotis et al 2004). Remarkably, the human ortholog HTD2 is encoded on a bicistronic gene together with RPP14, which encodes a 14-kDa subunit of the ribonuclease P/MRP. This uncommon genetic structure is conserved within vertebrates, which was interpreted as an ancient link between mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and RNA processing (Autio et al 2008).

6. The last step in the cycle is the trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, encoded by ME CR, which catalyzes the reduction of 2-transenoyl-ACP to acyl-ACP (Chen et al 2008). The

product is used for elongation with two further carbons by reaction with another malonyl-ACP at step 3. After three cycles, the product is an octanoyl-ACP.

Synthesis of lipoate from octanoate

As shown in Fig. 3, octanoyl-ACP from mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis is used to synthesize protein-bound LA.

7. The octanoyl moiety is transferred to a conserved lysine in the glycine cleavage H protein by an enzyme called octanoyl transferase, encoded by the LIP2 gene in yeast (Schonauer et al 2009). An orthologous gene called LIPT2 is found in the human genome.

8. The protein-bound octanoic acid is then sulphurated twice at positions 6 and 8 by the LA synthetase, encoded by LIAS, in a so-called radical S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) reaction (Morikawa et al 2001). LA synthetase contains two [4Fe-4S]-type iron–sulphur (FeS) clusters, which are sulphur donors and essential for the enzyme activity. The

Fig. 3 Lipoic acid (LA) synthesis in mitochondrial matrix includes mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis II, octanoyl transfer to the glycine cleavage H protein, LA synthetase, and lipoyl transferase. Human genes are shown in bold; orthologs in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* are shown in brackets. Genes indicated in red have been associated with human disease. The included enzymatic reactions are the following: 1 malonyl-coenzyme A synthetase (*in yeast: acetyl-coenzyme A carboxylase); 2 malonyl-coenzyme A, acyl-carrier protein acyltransferase; 3 3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase; 4 3-oxoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein reductase; 5 3-hydroxyacyl-thioester dehydratase; 6 trans-2-enoyl-coenzyme A reductase; 7 octanoyl transferase; 8 lipoic acid synthetase; 9 lipoyl transferase.

sulphur at position 6 in lipoate is formed in a stereoselective way, producing the R-enantiomer (Douglas et al 2006).

Finally, the lipoate residue is transferred to conserved lysine residues in the E2 subunits of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and to the E3-binding protein of PDHC. This step is catalyzed by lipoyl transferase, encoded by *LIPT1* (Schonauer et al 2009). A recent study performed in yeast provided more detailed information on *LIPT1* function and demonstrated that its yeast ortholog, *LIP3*, also possesses octanoyl-CoA transferase activity and is required for lipoylation of the E2 components of 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases (Hermes and Cronan 2013).

Model organisms and cell models with defects in lipoic acid synthesis

Endogenous LA synthesis is essential in mammals. LA synthetase (*Lias* gene) knockout mice die on gestational day 8 (Yi and Maeda 2005). Also, knockout of the *Dld* gene results in an early embryonic lethal phenotype (Johnson et al 1997). A conditional mouse knockout of the *Mcat* gene, which is necessary for the second step of the mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis II, results in defective protein lipoylation (Smith et al 2012). In yeast, knockouts of all genes involved in FAS II and the LA synthesis pathway result in growth deficiency on nonfermentable carbon sources. LA deficiency has been identified in all knockout strains investigated. In addition to the lipoylation defect, yeast mutants of fatty acid synthesis result in multiple failure of mitochondrial biogenesis, including heme biosynthesis, assembly of respiratory chain enzymes, and mitochondrial RNA splicing (Kursu et al 2013). Remarkably, knockout of the 4-phosphopantetheine:protein transferase (*PPT2* gene), which is necessary for posttranslational attachment of the cofactor phosphopantetheine on the mitochondrial ACP, results in LA deficiency (Stuible et al 1998). One phosphopantetheinyl transferase encoded by the *AASDHPPT* gene (amino adipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase-phosphopantetheinyl transferase) is found in the human genome. The *AASDHPPT* gene product is obviously located in the cytosol, which would necessitate a modification of the mitochondrial ACP prior to import into

mitochondria (Bunkoczi et al 2007). A deficiency in this protein has not been reported in humans, but a more complex phenotype, probably including LA deficiency, can be anticipated.

Knockdown of mitochondrial ACP, encoded by NDUFAB1, in human HEK293T cells results in a combined deficiency of protein lipoylation and a complex I deficiency. The latter occurs because NDUFAB1 is also an integral component of complex I, in addition to its function as ACP (Feng et al 2009).

### Diagnostics of lipoic acid deficiency

Diagnosis of defects in LA metabolism can be made by different approaches, either by direct measurement of the LA in case of a clear clinical suspicion, or by a combination of different techniques, including metabolite analysis, studies of mitochondrial energy metabolism in unfrozen tissue or cells, and investigation of affected enzymes. Due to increasing availability of genetic tools, such as panel diagnostics or exome sequencing, it is assumed that genetics will be an early diagnostic step in the future.

#### Metabolite analysis

Elevated lactate and/or pyruvate are often a first suspicious finding in clinical chemistry. Amino acid analysis in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or urine can reveal an isolated or combined elevation of the amino acids glycine, alanine, and branched-chain amino acids (isoleucine, leucine, valine, alloisoleucine). Remarkably, elevation of branched-chain amino acids seems to be a rare finding in LA-synthesis defects, which is occasionally found in DLD, E3 subunit deficiency but not in the other defects (Table 2). Glycine is normal in LIPT1 deficiency but is usually increased in the other LA defects. In the investigation of organic acids in urine, an elevation of lactate, α-ketoglutarate, 2-aminoadipate, or 2-oxoadipate can be indicative. Elevated 2-aminoadipate, which was consistently elevated in NFUI patients (Navarro-Sastre et al 2011), could be due to deficiency of the LA-dependent 2-oxoadipate dehydrogenase (2-OADH), a reaction that lies downstream of this metabolite.

#### Functional investigation of intact mitochondria

The investigation of biopsy material, especially skeletal muscle tissue and fibroblasts, can reveal a deficiency in the oxidation of, for example, pyruvate- and α-ketoglutarate-containing substrates due to the combined deficiency of pyruvate dehydrogenase and α-KGDH (Mayr et al 2011).

---

### Enzyme investigation

Analysis of enzymes in the standard workup of disorders in mitochondrial energy metabolism, which should include respiratory chain enzymes and PDHC, can reveal a deficiency in LA metabolism. PDHC deficiency is a constant finding both in defects of FeS biogenesis or LA synthesis defects, whereas a combined deficiency of PDHC and respiratory chain complex II is indicative of a defect in FeS cluster biosynthesis (Table 2). The GCS is barely expressed in usually available tissues, necessitating a liver biopsy for investigation (Baker et al 2014). Furthermore, analysis of BCKDH and 2-oxoadipated dehydrogenase can be helpful; the latter has not yet been reported with respect to LA deficiency.

#### Quantification of lipoic acid

As there is an antibody against protein-bound LA, lipoylation deficiency can be quantified by western blot analysis and shown by immunohistochemical staining (Mayr et al 2011). These techniques are highly versatile and work in a wide variety of cells, such as fibroblasts, and tissues. Furthermore lipoyllsine can be quantified spectrofluorometrically after enzymatic protein hydrolysis (Akiba et al 1998). Quantification of the total LA content of cells, which is performed after hydrolysis of the protein-bound LA under elevated temperature in strong acidic conditions, is an alternative method but does not directly show the defectively lipoylated proteins (Herbert and Guest 1968).

### Human disease caused by defects in lipoic acid synthesis

#### Disorders of lipoic acid synthetase

Deficiency of LA synthetase can be caused either by mutations in the structural gene LIAS or by deficiency in the synthesis of the [4Fe-4S] FeS cluster cofactors. Defects in LA synthetase result in a decrease in lipoylation of all lipoyl-containing enzymes, including the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases and the GCS.

##### Lipoic acid synthetase defect

Mutations in LIAS have been reported in three index patients with atypical nonketotic hyperglycinemia combined with defective mitochondrial energy metabolism (Mayr et al 2011; Baker et al 2014). These patients presented with seizures between the second and third day of life; one patient was responsive to topiramate and lamotrigine. The two patients with intractable seizures developed severe psychomotor retardation, with brain damage affecting the cerebellum, cortex, white matter, brain stem, internal capsule, and basal ganglia.

*Some patients have been reported with adult onset (Shaag et al 1999).

These patients died in early childhood. The patient responsive to anticonvulsive treatment showed a milder developmental delay and is free of convulsions at the age of 12 years. A sister of this patient presented at birth with hypotonia, tonic-clonic seizures, and an elevated plasma glycine (but normal CSF-to-plasma ratio). She died at 7 months of age (Baker et al 2014).

Iron-sulphur cluster biosynthesis defects

The number of genes that can cause defects in FeS cluster biosynthesis has been growing rapidly. FeS cluster biosynthesis is initiated in mitochondria and is continued in other cellular compartments. Numerous cellular proteins contain FeS clusters. They are involved in electron transfer reactions, participate in catalytic and regulatory processes, and serve as sulphur donors during LA synthesis (Stehling and Lill 2013). Mutations in the following FeS cluster biosynthesis genes have been reported: NFU1 (Cameron et al 2011; Navarro-Sastre et al 2011), BOLA3 (Cameron et al 2011), IBA57 (Ajit Bolar et al 2013), GLRX5 (Camaschella et al 2007; Baker et al 2014), ISCU (Mochel et al 2008; Olsson et al 2008), and others: FXN (Campuzano et al 1996), FDX1L (Spiegel et al 2013), LYRM4 (Lim et al 2013), and NFS1 (Farhan et al

Springer
symptoms that are frequently found in defects of mitochondrial energy metabolism (Table 2). However, patients with NFU1 deficiency usually present with pulmonary hypertension but without seizures that are typical of NKH (Navarro-Sastre et al 2011). Patients with BOLA3 deficiency have been reported with encephalopathy accompanied by severe cardiomyopathy (Cameron et al 2011; Baker et al 2014; Haack et al 2013). IBA57 deficiency has been reported in two siblings with severe early manifestation, intrauterine growth retardation, polyhydramnios, microcephaly, arthrogryposis, lactate elevation and hyperglycinemia, cerebral atrophy, polymicrogyria, severely hypoplastic corpus callosum, cytotoxic edema, and hypoplastic medulla oblongata. Both children died within the first week of life (Ajit Bolar et al 2013). Patients with GLRX5 deficiency presented with a milder phenotype compared with the other FeS cluster defects and are summarized here. All of those patients had normal development until the age of 2–7 years, when they developed spasticity, ataxia, and gait disturbance, but only mild cognitive affection (Baker et al 2014). The phenotype is clearly distinct from one previously reported patient with sideroblastic anemia and a homozygous GLRX5 mutation c.294A>G, which was hypothesized to have caused a splice defect (Camaschella et al 2007).

### Lipoyl transferase 1 deficiency

LIPT1 deficiency was first reported in a patient with early-onset fatal disease (Tort et al 2013). She had an initial symptom-free period, but at 2 days of life, she presented sudden clinical deterioration and severe bradycardia. Neurological examination revealed generalized hypotonia and dystonic movements. Brain imaging was normal, and an echocardiogram indicated severe pulmonary hypertension with left ventricle dilatation. Metabolic investigations revealed severe lactic acidosis and liver dysfunction. At 6 days of age, facial myoclonus and increasing generalized hypertonia with brisk deep-tendon reflexes appeared. Limitation of ventilatory support led to progressive deterioration and cardiorespiratory arrest at 9 days of age. Brain pathology showed patched periventricular gliosis and moderate astrocytosis, with gemistocytic astrocytes in the basal ganglia. This patient showed extremely reduced lipoylation of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases, but in contrast to the other LA biosynthesis defects, H protein lipoylation was normal, as were glycine levels and GCS activity in liver determined at autopsy. Later, a second patient with Leigh-like phenotype was described (Soreze et al 2013). This child presented with hypotonia and delayed psychomotor development, and showed sudden deterioration of clinical symptoms during a gastrointestinal crisis at 18 months of age, leading to coma with dystonia and spastic tetraparesia in subsequent days. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which was initially normal, showed cerebellar and infratentorial atrophy, bilateral thalamic and white-matter abnormalities, and delayed myelinization. This patient also showed a lipoylation defect of the 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. Lactate and α-ketoglutarate were elevated in both patients.

#### Dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase deficiency

The largest number of patients with lipoate metabolism disturbance has been reported with DLD, E3 subunit, (MIM246900) deficiency. The clinical picture of patients with DLD deficiency is heterogeneous, including patients with onset at birth and a severe course with early death but also patient with late onset and milder affection like exertional fatigue (Shaag et al 1999). Typical clinical symptoms are muscular hypotonia, failure to thrive, liver dysfunction and encephalopathy (Quinonez et al 2013). Lactic acidosis and elevation of α-ketoglutarate in urine are a common finding, whereas elevation of branched chain amino acids and allo-isoleucine in plasma is usually less pronounced or absent (Quinonez et al 2013). In some patients elevated citrulline has been reported (Haviv et al 2013). Remarkably, glycine is normal in nearly all patients with DLD deficiency, there is one early report of reduced GCS in a liver sample of one DLD patient (Yoshino et al 1986). The three 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases PDHC, α-KGDH and BCKDH have been analysed in several studies and variable affection has been shown in different patients, e.g. showing in a family with three patients with encephalopathy and cardiomyopathy a predominant decrease of the α-KGDH (Odievre et al 2005). A decrease of the 2-OADH has not been investigated; however, an elevated level of 2-oxoadipic acid has been reported in DLD patients (Shaag et al 1999).

#### Other potential lipoic acid defects

Defects in reactions that are involved in the synthesis of LA have been reported that either do not result in a deficiency of lipoate or have not been characterized in detail:

##### Malonyl-CoA synthetase (ACSF3) deficiency

Deficiency of ACSF3, encoding an acyl-CoA synthetase, results in combined malonic acid/methylmalonic acid excretion in urine (CMAMMA; MIM614265), but there was neither LA synthesis defect, nor lactic acidosis, nor glycine elevation noted (Alfares et al 2011; Sloan et al 2011). Even though this enzymatic step seems to play a role in mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis, there is probably a backup for malonyl-CoA synthesis in mitochondria (Witkowski et al 2011). Clinically, patients present during childhood with coma, ketoacidosis, hypoglycemia, failure to thrive, elevated transaminases, microcephaly, dystonia, axial hypotonia, and/or developmental delay.
Glycine cleavage H protein (GCSH) deficiency

So far, no patient with clear mutations in the GCSH gene has been identified (Van Hove et al 1993; Kure et al 2006). A complex GCSH gene rearrangement has been reported (Koyata and Hiraga 1991), and there was biochemical evidence for GCSH deficiency in an early publication (Hiraga et al 1981). The H protein isolated from the patient's liver upon autopsy was found a normal amount but showed evidence of decreased lipoylation in a 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reduction assay (Hiraga et al 1981). As the H protein of the GCS is an integral part of lipoate synthesis (Fig. 3), a lack of this step is expected to result in an LA synthesis defect with a LIAS-like phenotype. Therefore, patients with variant NKH are candidates for GCSH deficiency.

Treatment and future prospects

Treatment options

As shown in several studies, extracellularly supplemented LA cannot be used for lipoylation of mitochondrial proteins (Hiltunen et al 2010). Rather, Its effects are due to the antioxidative properties of LA or modification of the transcription of multiple enzymes (Packer and Cadenas 2011). In case of LA supplementation, a secondary decrease in biotin-dependent enzymes was observed, most likely due to the relations of these compounds (Zempleni et al 1997). Therapeutic interventions in LA deficiency are at the moment restricted to symptomatic treatment, e.g., anticonvulsive treatment in case of a NKH-like phenotype.

Expected novel defects of the lipoic acid metabolism

According to data from mouse and yeast knockouts and from knockdowns in human cell culture (cf. section on models of LA deficiency), a number of additional defects of LA metabolism can be anticipated. Mutations in LIPT2 or GCSH are expected to cause a LIAS-like phenotype with combined involvement of the GCS and the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenases. As the entire function of mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis is not yet clear, the precise phenotype of such deficiencies is difficult to anticipate. Probably there is also an increase in malonic and methylmalonic acid or other synthesis intermediates, which can probably be found by metabolite analyses. In case of cofactors, it can be expected that additional disorders in the mitochondrial FeS cluster biosynthesis might result in a downstream deficiency of LA synthesis. Furthermore, it can be expected that deficiency of 4-phosphopantetheine, a prosthetic group of the ACP, could result in defective mitochondrial fatty acid synthesis and a downstream deficiency of LA.

Taken together, LA biosynthesis defects are a rapidly expanding group of inherited disorders of amino acid and energy metabolism. They affect six proteins from five enzyme complexes in mitochondria. A characteristic condition is the combined elevation of lactate, α-ketoglutarate, or 2-aminoadipate, and—in a subset of lipoylation defects—glycine.
