Is cancer triggered by altered signalling of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors?

**Hildegard M. Schuller**

Abstract | Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are the central regulators of stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters that control the synthesis and release of growth, angiogenic and neurotrophic factors in cancer cells, the cancer microenvironment and distant organs. Data discussed in this Review suggests that smoking and possibly other environmental and lifestyle factors increase the function of nAChRs that stimulate cancer cells and reduce the function of nAChRs that inhibit cancer cells. This novel paradigm necessitates the development of marker-guided cancer intervention strategies that aim to restore the balance between nAChR-mediated stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and their downstream effectors.

Smoking is a documented risk factor for cancer, an association that is particularly strong for lung cancer¹. Four major types of lung cancer are recognized: adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and large cell carcinoma². Although smoking increases the risk for the development of all lung cancers, adenocarcinoma, large cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma also develop in a significant population of non-smokers³. Among the thousands of chemicals in tobacco smoke, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and nicotine-derived nitrosamines have been identified as potent cancer-causing agents and the interactions of their metabolites with DNA are thought to be the primary cause of cancer in smokers⁴. Nicotine itself has been recognized as a cause of cardiovascular disease⁵ and is believed to trigger the neurobiological and psychological effects that are associated with smoking dependence and addiction⁶. These effects of nicotine are mediated by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in the central and peripheral nervous system⁷. The discoveries that nAChRs are expressed in lung cancer cells where they regulate proliferation⁸ and apoptosis⁹, and that nicotine-derived carcinogenic nitrosamines are agonists for these receptors¹⁰ marked the beginning of a new chapter in cancer research: the role of nAChRs in the development and progression of cancer.

Structure and function of nAChRs

nAChRs are located in the plasma membrane and comprise five subunits forming hetero- or homo-pentamers that enclose a central ion channel (FIG. 1). They were initially identified in the nervous system and at the junction of nerve endings with muscles and classified into neuronal versus muscle nAChRs¹²⁻¹⁵. The neuronal nAChRs can either be composed of five identical α7, α8 or α9 subunits (homomeric nAChRs) or consist of combinations of α2–α6 or α10 subunits with β2–β4 subunits (heteromeric nAChRs). The muscle nAChRs may be comprised of combinations of α1 subunits with β1, γ, δ or ε subunits¹⁶. Both nAChR families are expressed in cancer cells¹¹ but only the function of neuronal nAChRs in cancer cells has been studied to date. The neurotransmitter acetylcholine is the physiological agonist for all nAChRs¹¹. It was initially believed that the activation of nAChRs requires the release of acetylcholine from neurons or nerve endings. However, recent studies showed that nAChRs, acetylcholine and its synthesizing

At a glance
- Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are ion channels that are expressed in the plasma membrane of all mammalian cells, including cancer cells.
- nAChRs are central regulators that stimulate the synthesis and release of stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters, which in turn regulate the release of growth, angiogenic and neurogenic factors and stimulate signal transduction in a cell-type-specific manner.
- Chronic exposure to nicotine or nicotine-derived carcinogenic nitrosamines upregulates cancer-stimulatory nAChRs and desensitizes cancer-inhibitory nAChRs.
- The homomeric α7nAChR is the major stimulator of cancer development and progression: it induces the synthesis and release of autocrine growth factors in small-cell lung cancer and indirectly stimulates most other types of cancer through the systemic and cellular release of stress neurotransmitters that bind as agonists to β-adrenergic receptors.
- The heteromeric α4β2nAChR is a major inhibitor of cancer development and progression: it stimulates the release of γ-aminobutyric acid, which blocks the cancer stimulating effects of β-adrenergic receptors by inhibiting cyclic AMP.
- Marker-guided cancer intervention strategies that target nAChRs and their effectors that aim to restore the balance between stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters need to be developed.

α4β2nAChR, than to the α7nAChR^{7,23}. The higher affinity of nicotine for this receptor is thought to cause the long-term inactivation (or desensitization) of the α4β2nAChR that has been observed after chronic exposure to nicotine levels comparable to those in heavy as well as light smokers^{22}. By contrast, the sensitivity of α7nAChR remains unchanged^{22}. Accordingly, the biological functions of α7nAChR are increased in smokers, whereas the functions of α4β2nAChR are impaired. Unfortunately, α7nAChR is the most powerful regulator of responses that stimulate cancer cells, whereas the α4β2nAChR regulates predominantly inhibitory actions, resulting in an environment that provides selective support for the development and progression of cancer. Desensitization is not permanent and the receptor eventually recovers after removal of nicotine. Therefore, cell lines from tumours or tissues in smokers are unlikely to express desensitized heteromeric nAChRs. The smoking-induced loss of their *in vivo* inhibitory functions can only be detected *in vitro* if the cells are chronically re-exposed to nicotine. In the desensitized state, higher concentrations of agonist are required to elicit responses downstream of the receptor. In addition, withdrawal of nicotine results in subnormal release of neurotransmitters previously stimulated in abundance. Collectively, these events are thought to trigger nicotine addiction and nicotine withdrawal symptoms^{6}. As explained below, desensitization of the inhibitory α4β2nAChR and upregulation of the stimulatory α7nAChR also serve as central driving forces for the development of the most common human cancers.

α7nAChR and α4β2nAChR jointly stimulate the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter dopamine and regulate cognition and memory (FIG. 2). In addition to actions in the brain, dopamine stimulates the proliferation of cancer cells in the prostate and mammary gland^{24}. In addition, the α4β2nAChR stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). GABA is the most important inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain but it also acts as a tumour suppressor for adenocarcinoma of the lung^{25}, pancreas^{26}, breast^{27} and colon^{28}. Oestrogen and phyto-oestrogens desensitize α4β2nAChR by as yet unknown mechanisms, an effect thought to trigger the greater difficulty for women to quit smoking^{29} and possibly contribute to the high risk of women for the development of lung adenocarcinoma^{30}. α7nAChR mediates the anti-inflammatory actions of the cholinergic system, including the inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokines, tumour necrosis factor-α and inhibition of immune cells such as T and B lymphocytes^{31,32}. In addition, this receptor stimulates the release of the neurotransmitters glutamate and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) (FIG. 2). In addition to functions in the brain, serotonin also acts as a growth factor for small-cell lung cancer (SCLC)^{33,34} and colon cancer^{35,36}.

α7nAChR also stimulates the release of the neuropeptide mammalian bombesin, an autocrine growth factor for SCLC cells^{37}. α7nAChR and heteromeric nAChRs containing α4 or α3 subunits jointly stimulate the release of the stress neurotransmitters

Nicotinic receptor signalling and cancer  
The ubiquitous expression of nAChRs in mammalian cells and their diverse regulatory functions suggest that modulation of these receptors owing to chronic exposure to tobacco constituents or other environmental and lifestyle factors may contribute to the development of cancer. This hypothesis gained strong support after the discovery that the tobacco-specific carcinogenic nitrosamines 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) and N-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) are agonists for α7nAchR and the heteromeric α–βnAChRs, respectively<sup>10</sup>. Both nitrosamines cause lung cancer in laboratory animals<sup>4</sup>. The affinity of NNK for the α7nAChR was found to be 1,300× higher than that of nicotine, whereas the affinity of NNN for heteromeric α–βnAChRs was 5,000× higher than that of nicotine<sup>10,50</sup>. Owing to their high affinity for nAChRs, NNK and NNN displace nicotine from these receptors. Therefore, many of the cardiovascular, neuropsychological and cancer-stimulating effects currently attributed to nicotine are probably caused by these nitrosamines. In support of this interpretation, binding of NNK to α7nAChR caused influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> into lung cells and the resulting membrane depolarization activated voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup>51</sup>. Chronic exposure to NNK also upregulated α7nAChR<sup>52</sup>. The principles of nAChR function (cation channel function and receptor upregulation) in response to acute and chronic nicotine exposure are thus identical when the receptor is stimulated by NNK. Although all nAChRs are cation channels, they regulate diverse functions in a cell-type-specific manner. This functional diversity is also reflected in cancers of different cellular origin as described below.

Role of nAChRs in SCLC. Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells (PNECs) and SCLC, a neuroendocrine type of cancer, express high levels of the α7nAChR, whereas heteromeric α–βnAChRs were undetectable<sup>53–55</sup>. Nicotine or NNK-stimulated proliferation of PNECs or SCLC *in vitro* through activation of protein kinase C (PKC), the serine/threonine kinase RAF1, the mitogen activated kinases ERK1 and ERK2, and the transcription factors FOS, JUN and MYC (FIG. 3). A selective α7nAChR antagonist abolished these responses, identifying α7nAChR as the site of nicotine or NNK binding<sup>33,34,54</sup>. Exogenous addition of the autocrine growth factors serotonin or mammalian bombesin activated the same signalling cascade<sup>33,34</sup>, whereas a serotonin uptake inhibitor abolished the effects of nicotine or NNK<sup>34</sup>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel blockers significantly reduced DNA synthesis in response to nicotine or NNK<sup>51</sup>. NNK additionally stimulated the migration of SCLC cells, an effect caused by the ERK1–ERK2-dependent phosphorylation of m-calpains and μ-calpains<sup>56</sup>. Pharmacological inhibition of ERK1–ERK2 or silencing of the calpains by small interfering RNA technology blocked this response<sup>56</sup>. Moreover, NNK inhibited apoptosis in SCLC cells through activation of BCL-2, an effect blocked by the PKC inhibitor staurosporin, the ERK1–ERK2 inhibitor PD98059 or silencing of MYC<sup>57</sup>. Collectively, these findings identify α7nAChR as the central regulator of proliferation, apoptosis and migration of SCLC cells through stimulation of the release of the autocrine growth factors serotonin and mammalian bombesin and possibly other neuropeptides (FIG. 3). Direct stimulation of this signalling cascade by the influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through the opened α7nAChR and voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels may also contribute to the observed responses. In addition, other autocrine

This makes the electric charge on the inside of the plasma membrane less negative (a process called membrane depolarization). In turn, this change in electrical charge opens the gates of voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, leading to additional influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

PNECs and SCLC cells *in vitro* were more sensitive to the growth-stimulating effects of nicotine in an environment of high CO₂ and low O₂, and long-term maintenance of the cells in this environment upregulated and sensitized α7nAChR⁶⁵⁻⁶⁷. These effects of subnormal O₂ concentrations on α7nAChR have important clinical implications. SCLC has a stronger association with smoking than other types of lung cancer³. In turn, among smokers, those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at a particularly high risk of developing SCLC⁶⁸. COPD is an inflammatory lung disease associated with decreased expiration of CO₂ (REF. 69) and upregulation of α7nAChR⁷⁰. Although the tobacco carcinogen NNK normally binds to β-adrenergic receptors in the healthy lung⁴³,⁷¹, it binds preferentially to the sensitized α7nAChR in the COPD lung. In addition, the COPD lung typically overexpresses phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme that catalyses the intracellular breakdown of cAMP⁷²,⁷³. The resulting deficiency in intracellular cAMP deprives lung cells of their defence against hyperactive RAF1-mediated signalling. The pulmonary microenvironment in the COPD lung thus selectively favours the development of a neuroendocrine type of lung cancer under positive growth control by α7nAChR (FIG. 3). In support of this interpretation, nicotine caused the development of SCLC-like neuroendocrine lung tumours in hamsters with experimentally induced COPD, whereas healthy hamsters given nicotine developed no tumours⁷⁴. Healthy hamsters treated with NNK developed β-adrenergic receptor-regulated adenocarcinomas of the lung, whereas hamsters with COPD and given NNK developed SCLC-like neuroendocrine lung tumours⁷⁵. In turn, the phosphodiesterase inhibitor theophylline, which increases intracellular cAMP, significantly inhibited neuroendocrine lung tumour development in the COPD hamsters⁷⁶.

The role of nAChRs in non-small-cell lung cancer. In contrast to PNECs and SCLC cells, bronchial epithelial cells, which are also known as large airway epithelial cells and give rise to squamous cell carcinoma, bronchiolar epithelial cells, which are also known as small airway epithelial cells and are the origin of most pulmonary adenocarcinomas (PACs), and alveolar type II cells, which are the origin of a small subset of PACs, all express multiple heteromeric nAChRs in addition to the α7nAChR¹¹,⁷⁷. These lung cancers are collectively referred to as non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs). Studies in cell lines from large-cell carcinoma, squamous-cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma of small airway and alveolar type II cell of origin as well as immortalized large- and small-airway epithelial cells showed that nicotine and NNK activated the PI3K–Akt pathway and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) (FIG. 4), resulting in stimulation of proliferation and inhibition of chemotherapy-induced apoptosis⁷⁸,⁷⁹. Agonists of α7nAChR or heteromeric nAChRs containing the α3 or α4 subunits had similar effects, suggesting the joint actions of these three receptors as mediators of the observed responses. However, in a smoker’s lung the responses to nicotine or NNK would primarily be mediated by α7nAChR because the heteromeric nAChRs are

Figure 2 | The diverse functions of the homomeric α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and of the heteromeric α4β2nAChRs. Both receptors stimulate the release of the excitatory neurotransmitter dopamine. In addition, α7nAChR stimulates the release of the excitatory neurotransmitters glutamate and serotonin, as well as the neuropeptide mammalian bombesin and the stress neurotransmitters adrenaline and noradrenaline. In addition to regulating brain functions, these agents also stimulate the growth of several types of cancer either by the direct activation of intracellular signalling pathways or indirectly by regulating the release of epidermal growth factor (EGF), vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) or arachidonic acid (AA). α7nAChR additionally mediates the cholinergic control of immune cells and anti-inflammatory actions of the cholinergic system. The heteromeric α4β2nAChR stimulates the release of the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In addition to its inhibitory actions on brain functions, GABA has tumour suppressor function on several types of cancer. SCLC, small-cell lung cancer; TNFα, tumour necrosis factor-α.

growth factors for SCLC cells, including bradykinin, vasopressin, neurotensin and galanin, all activate signalling through RAF1–Erk in these cells⁵⁸, thus cooperating with the α7nAChR-initiated signalling pathway. Inhibitors of PKC or ERK1–ERK2³⁴,⁵⁶,⁵⁷,⁵⁹ as well as agents that increase intracellular cyclic AMP strongly reduced nAChR-stimulated DNA synthesis of SCLC cells *in vitro*⁴⁹,⁶⁰, presumably through RAF1 inhibition by cAMP-dependent protein kinase A⁶¹.

Nicotine has similar stimulating effects through α7nAChR on angiogenesis in endothelial cells owing to exogenously added Vegf and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF, also known as FGF2)⁶². This observation is in accord with the ability of α7nAChR to stimulate the release of these angiogenic factors from cancer cells⁶³ and implicates this receptor as an important mediator of angiogenesis during the development of cancer. Interestingly, a hypoxic environment (due to ischaemia) upregulated and sensitized (that is, led to lower concentrations of agonist being needed to respond) α7nAChR in endothelial cells⁶²,⁶⁴. In analogy to these findings,

desensitized. In addition, the presence of penicillin and streptomycin, which interfere with β-adrenergic receptor signalling, precluded the β-adrenergic responses to NNK that were reported in the absence of antibiotics in small-airway epithelial cells and in PACs derived from them ${ }^{43,80,81}$. The *in vitro* findings are in accord with the observation that Akt is frequently constitutively active in NSCLC and promotes resistance to chemotherapy ${ }^{82}$. Studies in an alveolar type II cell-derived PAC additionally showed that the Akt-dependent nicotine-induced resistance to apoptosis involved upregulation of survivin (also known as BIRC5) and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP; also known as BIRC4) ${ }^{83}$, whereas α7nAChR-mediated stimulation of NSCLC cell proliferation through activation of β-arrestin–SRC was also observed ${ }^{84}$. NNK also induced the ERK1–ERK2-activated transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), NF-κB and GATA3 in immortalized human bronchial epithelial cells, whereas NNN activated only GATA3 and STAT1 (REF. 85). The responses to NNK were inhibited by an α7nAChR antagonist, whereas the effects of NNN were inhibited by an antagonist for heteromeric nAChRs. A more recent study with immortalized large-airway epithelial cells reported that nicotine stimulated the release of EGF from these cells. In turn, binding of the released EGF to the EGFR activated the Ras–Raf–Erk cascade, a response blocked by a selective antagonist for α7nAChR ${ }^{86}$. This finding is in accord with the physiological role of nAChRs as regulators of growth factor release (FIG. 2) and suggests that the intracellular signalling events in response to nAChR stimulation in NSCLC cells and their normal cells of origin are mostly caused by the release of EGF. In accord with this interpretation, the signalling events described downstream of nAChRs in these cells are characteristic downstream effectors of the EGFR.

In the absence of antibiotics, NNK-treated small-airway epithelial cells and the PACs derived from them are stimulated in their growth and migration by β-adrenergic receptor-initiated cAMP signalling that transactivates the EGFR (FIG. 5) and cooperates with non-genomic oestrogen receptor-β signalling ${ }^{43,80,81}$. A nAChR-mediated systemic increase in adrenaline and noradrenaline, which are β-adrenergic agonists, may additionally stimulate the development of this type of PAC. In support of this hypothesis, treatment of hamsters with adrenaline significantly promoted the development of NNK-induced small-airway-derived PAC ${ }^{71}$.

Recent studies suggest a tumour suppressor function of GABA for PAC by showing reduced GABA expression in NNK-induced PACs in hamsters and inhibition of cAMP-dependent DNA synthesis and GABA-dependent migration of human PAC cells *in vitro* ${ }^{25}$. As α4β2nAChR regulates the release of GABA, desensitization of this receptor in smokers ${ }^{17,22}$ or by NNK in hamsters ${ }^{25}$ may therefore lead to GABA deficiency. In support of this interpretation, reduced GABA levels have been reported in the brains of smokers, particularly in women ${ }^{87}$. Moreover, it has been shown that RNA levels of the α4 subunit (CHRNA4) was significantly lower in PAC tissues than in normal lung tissue or other types of NSCLCs ${ }^{88}$,

Figure 3 | Regulation of small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) cells and their cells of origin. The figure presents a working model summarizing the proposed regulation of SCLC cells and their normal progenitor cells (pulmonary neuroendocrine cells; PNECs) by the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR). The nicotinic agonists at the top of the signalling cascade are listed in the order of their affinity to α7nAChR ${ }^{10,50}$. Binding of an agonist to the receptor causes an influx of Ca ${ }^{2+}$ through its ion channel. This effect is enhanced by the simultaneous activation of voltage-activated Ca ${ }^{2+}$-channels. The increased intracellular Ca ${ }^{2+}$ concentration triggers the release of the autocrine growth factors serotonin and mammalian bombesin as well as the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor (Vegf) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2). In turn, serotonin and mammalian bombesin, in concert with other neuropeptide growth factors whose neurotransmitter regulation is unclear at this time, activate a signalling cascade through protein kinase C (PKC), RAF1 and the MAPK cascade, leading to stimulation of cell proliferation and migration and inhibition of apoptosis. Chronic exposure to NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butane), nicotine or NNN (N-nitrosonornicotine) upregulates α7nAChR. In the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) lung pro-inflammatory cytokines further upregulate the receptor. The hypoxic microenvironment in the COPD lung upregulates and sensitizes nAChRs. At the same time, upregulated phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) eliminates the intracellular cAMP that normally balances the hyperactive signalling of this signalling cascade through blockage of RAF1 by PKA. G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) stimulate cAMP.

whereas oestrogen and phyto-oestrogens were reported to desensitize α4β2nAChR ${ }^{29}$. The predominance of PAC in women may therefore at least in part be the result of impaired α4β2nAChR function (FIG. 5).

A working model summarizing the proposed regulation of NSCLC cells and their normal cells of origin (airway epithelial cells and alveolar type II cells) by the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) and heteromeric α–β nAChRs. The nicotinic agonists at the top of the signalling cascades are listed in the order of their affinity to the nAChRs. NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone) and choline bind with the highest affinity to the α7nAChR, and NNN (N-nitrosonornicotine) and nicotine preferentially bind to heteromeric nAChRs. In vitro, the homomeric and heteromeric nAChRs jointly stimulate the indicated signalling cascades. By contrast, in a smoker this signalling pathway is largely regulated by α7nAChR because the heteromeric nAChRs are desensitized. Influx of Ca²⁺ and other cations through the nAChRs and voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels triggers the release of epidermal growth factor (EGF), which activates the EGFR signalling cascade. The responsiveness of this pathway is enhanced by α7nAChR-mediated activation of Ras through β-arrestin-dependent SRC. In turn, the EGFR activates the Akt pathway and its downstream effectors, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP)–survivin and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). FGF2, fibroblast growth factor 2; Vegf, vascular endothelial growth factor.

Role of nAChRs in gastrointestinal cancer. The pioneering studies of Dr Cho’s laboratory showed that nicotine-induced systemic increase in noradrenaline significantly enhanced the growth and angiogenesis of xenografts from gastric cancer and colon cancer in nude mice and the tumour tissues showed increased expression in ERK1–ERK2, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2, also known as PTGS2) prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and Vegf⁴⁷,⁸⁹,⁹⁰. This laboratory also reported that nicotine stimulated the synthesis and release of noradrenaline and adrenaline in colon cancer cells in vitro, resulting in increased cell proliferation that was blocked by an α7nAChR antagonist⁴⁰. Thus, α7nAChR stimulated the growth and angiogenesis of gastric and colon cancer by systemic as well as cellular increase in stress neurotransmitters, leading to β-adrenergic signalling, transactivation of the EGFR and release of EGF (FIG. 5). β-Adrenergic cAMP-dependent signalling also stimulated the in vitro growth and migration as well as release of arachidonic acid in cell lines from pancreatic cancer²⁶,⁴⁴,⁹¹. These findings suggest that an nAChR-mediated systemic increase in stress neurotransmitters may also stimulate the development and progression of pancreatic cancer. In analogy to the reported tumour suppressor function of GABA in lung adenocarcinoma²⁵, GABA inhibited basal level and isoproterenol-induced DNA synthesis and migration of pancreatic cancer cells through Gα₁-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase²⁶. In addition, noradrenaline and several β-adrenergic signalling effectors were overexpressed in the majority of PDACs investigated and the expression of GABA was suppressed²⁶. These findings support the hypothesis that the increased risk of smokers for the development of PDAC may be associated with hyperactive synthesis and release of stress neurotransmitters caused by an upregulated α7nAChR and a concomitant deficit in GABA due to a desensitized α4β2nAChR. Interestingly, it has also been shown that GABA inhibits adrenaline-induced migration of cancer cells from the colon, prostate and breast²⁸, suggesting that reduced GABA release may also contribute to the increased risk of smokers for the development of these cancers.

Signalling downstream of the α7nAChR and heteromeric nAChRs expressing α3 and α5 subunits have been reported in oral epithelial cells from which oral cancer arises and in oesophageal keratinocytes from which oesophageal cancer arises⁵⁰,⁹²–⁹⁴. In analogy to findings in lung cancer cells¹⁰, NNK bound with high affinity to α7nAChR, whereas NNN bound heteromeric nAChRs with high affinity. Both nitrosamines stimulated cell proliferation while inhibiting apoptosis by signalling through Ras–Raf–ERK1–ERK2, the JAK2–STAT3 pathway, NF-κB and induction of GATA3 and STAT1. In addition, the expression levels of SLURP1 (secreted mammalian Ly6–PLAUR-related protein 1) and SLURP2 were reduced. Transfection of the cells with SLURP1 or SLURP2 cDNA reduced the nitrosamine-induced colony formation in soft agar while inhibiting the growth of NNK-transformed keratinocytes in mouse xenografts. SLURP1 bound to α7nAChR and SLURP2 bound to nAChRs expressing the α3 subunit⁹⁵. In addition, chronic exposure of oral keratinocytes to nicotine or environmental tobacco smoke selectively upregulated α5 and α7 nAChR subunits, resulting in intensified signalling responses to nicotine⁹⁶. Two recent articles reported adrenaline-induced proliferation and activation of the Ras–MAPK pathway in oesophageal cancer cells downstream of β-adrenergic receptors that included transactivation of the EGFR⁹⁷,⁹⁸. In analogy to findings in colon cancer cells⁴⁰, nAChRs may therefore stimulate oral and oesophageal epithelial cells and the cancers derived from them by triggering the synthesis and release of adrenaline and noradrenaline.

Role of nAChRs in other cancers. Nicotine stimulated the proliferation of mesothelioma cells through α7nAChR-mediated Ca²⁺-dependent activation of the ERK1–ERK2 cascade and inhibited apoptosis by

induction of NF-κB and phosphorylation of BAD (Bcl-2 antagonist of cell death)⁹⁹. Activation of ERK1–ERK2 and STAT3 in response to nicotine has also been reported in bladder cancer cells downstream of nAChRs and β-adrenergic receptors¹⁰⁰. These findings suggest that nAChR-mediated catecholamine synthesis and release leads to either concomitant release of EGF or transactivation of EGFR in these cancers.

A number of studies have reported stimulation of cancer cells by stress neurotransmitters or dopamine *in vitro*. The regulatory role of nAChRs for the synthesis and release of these and other neurotransmitters²² implicates these receptors as the central regulators of such responses *in vivo*. In this context, it is important that the development of cancer is not just accompanied by the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) but also by the growth of nerve endings into the tumour microenvironment (neurogenesis)¹⁰¹,¹⁰². In analogy to tumour angiogenesis, where tumour cells release angiogenic factors that stimulate the growth of new blood vessels, tumour neurogenesis (FIG. 6) is triggered by the release of neurotrophic factors from tumour cells that stimulate the growth of new nerve fibres from neighbouring nerves into tumour tissues¹⁰³. In turn, the release of angiogenic factors is stimulated by α7nAChR⁶⁴, whereas the synthesis and release of neurotrophic factors are regulated by α7nAChR through the stimulation of glutamate production and by α4β2nAChR through inhibition by GABA¹⁰⁴,¹⁰⁵. It has thus been shown that noradrenaline and dopamine stimulated the migration of breast cancer cells and prostate cancer cells²⁴. In both cases, this response was mediated by adenylyl cyclase-dependent signalling. These findings are in accord with the excitatory functions of dopamine through the Gαₛ-coupled dopamine 1 receptor family¹⁰⁶ and indicate that these receptors cooperate with β-adrenergic receptors to stimulate breast cancer and prostate cancer. In addition, a β-adrenergic agonist stimulated DNA synthesis and ERK1–ERK2 activation and the release of arachidonic acid in breast cancer cell lines¹⁰⁷. Adrenaline or experimentally induced stress also induced the progression, metastasis and angiogenesis of ovarian cancer cells or nasopharyngeal cancer cells through β-adrenergic receptor signalling⁴⁸,¹⁰⁸,¹⁰⁹. The observed effects were cAMP-dependent and involved increases in metalloproteinases and VEGF. It is to be expected that GABA would inhibit such tumour-promoting effects of the stress neurotransmitters by Gαᵢ-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.

### Implications and future directions

The survival and health of the mammalian organism is sustained by an elaborate network of stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters and their receptors, which govern the function of all organs and cells. nAChRs act as central regulators of this vital network. Although it is generally accepted that chronic exposure to nicotine modulates the expression and function of nAChRs, the tobacco-specific nitrosamines NNK and NNN may have more pronounced effects due to their higher affinity for these receptors. In addition, polymorphisms

Working model of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR)-mediated regulation of adenocarcinomas of the stomach, pancreas and colon and small-airway-derived adenocarcinoma. α7nAChR indirectly stimulates these cancers through β-adrenergic receptor signalling following the release of adrenaline and noradrenaline. The responsiveness of this pathway is enhanced by additional direct activation of β-adrenergic receptors by NNK (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone). Adenylyl cyclase activation downstream of the β-adrenergic receptors induces the cyclic AMP–protein kinase A (PKA)–CREB (cAMP response element-binding protein) pathway, transactivates epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and induces the release of EGF, arachidonic acid (AA) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). The inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) inhibits this signalling cascade at the level of adenylyl cyclase. In turn, the release of GABA is regulated by α4β2nAChR, which is desensitized in smokers and additionally downregulated in lung adenocarcinomas, leading to a deficit in GABA. The desensitization of this receptor is enhanced by oestrogens.

in the 15q region, which contains the genes for the α3 and α5 subunits of heteromeric nAChRs that are associated with a predisposition to lung cancer¹¹⁰, have recently been shown to increase lung cancer risk in a smoking-independent manner¹¹¹, suggesting that tobacco-independent factors may also alter nAChRs.

the nAChRs in nerve endings, blood vessels, connective tissue, and inflammatory and immune cells in the tumour microenvironment and in distant organs, such as the adrenal gland and the brain. Cancer researchers have mostly interpreted intracellular signalling in response to AChR agonists as direct responses to binding of these agonists to nAChRs expressed in the cells under study. However, nAChRs operate predominantly in an indirect fashion by altering the synthesis and release of neurotransmitters that in turn regulate the synthesis and release of growth, angiogenic and neurotrophic factors. Many abnormalities that have been described in cancer cells may thus directly or indirectly be caused by malfunctioning nAChRs. Interestingly, the simultaneous expression of oncogenic KRAS, p53 knockdown and mutant EGFRs were recently shown to be insufficient to confer a full malignant phenotype in bronchial epithelial cells 115, suggesting that the significance of these gene changes for lung carcinogenesis may have been overemphasized. It remains to be explored whether the simultaneous presence of altered nAChRs would increase the transforming ability of such changes.

The upregulation of nAChRs and concomitant desensitization of α4β2nAChR in smokers shifts the balance in favour of α7nAChR signalling with strong direct and indirect stimulatory effects on cancer cells, whereas the release of GABA, which counteracts many of these effects, is reduced. In lung adenocarcinoma the resulting imbalance in stimulatory and inhibitory neurotransmitters is further escalated by the additional downregulation of α4nAChRs88. This universal switch from balanced neurotransmission to cancer-stimulating neurotransmission is unstoppable once it occurs: blocking one signalling pathway or even removing the primary cancer will not stop the runaway α7nAChR train.

Although avoidance of tobacco remains the best cancer prevention, the emerging understanding of the roles of nAChRs in the development and progression of cancer provides novel opportunities for the prevention and therapy of cancer. The use of nAChR antagonists that block the receptors is problematic because these receptors regulate so many vital cell and organ functions. An α7nAChR antagonist may thus successfully block cancer cells without cytotoxicity to normal control cells *in vitro*, but *in vivo* it would block signals essential for the control of inflammatory reactions and the regulation of respiratory and cardiovascular functions, and induce mental and psychological problems including symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease and schizophrenia7,116.

Blockers of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels might be an alternative because they would desensitize the hyperactive α7nAChR (FIG. 1). A similar effect may be achieved by pharmacological treatment with SLURP1, which reduces the responsiveness of α7nAChR to agonists92. However, any attempt to prevent or treat cancer by targeting nAChRs should be based on the identification of molecular markers. The goal of this strategy should be the restoration of balance between stimulatory and inhibitory signalling and not the complete blockade of a given pathway. A promising approach would be to identify the

In fact, a recent report pointed out structural similarities between acetylcholine and the carcinogenic nitrosamine N-nitrosodiethylamine (DEN) and identified DEN as a high-affinity ligand for homomeric and heteromeric nAChRs in SCLC and PAC cells112. In light of the fact that DEN and similar nitrosamines are contained in numerous foods, beverages and cosmetics113,114, this family of agents may contribute to non-tobacco-related modulations of nAChRs. As this receptor family is expressed in every mammalian cell, modulation affects the regulation of all mammalian cells. Cancer cells are not only influenced by their own nAChRs but also by

Figure 6 | Regulation of tumour angiogenesis and neurogenesis by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs). In order to grow at the expense of normal tissues and cells, cancer cells need to be provided with nutrients and hormones through newly formed blood vessels (angiogenesis) and with regulatory neurotransmitters through newly formed nerve endings (neurogenesis). Depending on the cell type, α7nAChR stimulates the release of angiogenic factors either directly or indirectly through stress neurotransmitter release that activates β-adrenergic signalling dependent on adenylyl cyclase activation. In addition, α7nAChR stimulates the synthesis and release of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate that triggers the release of neurotrophic factors, resulting in neurogenesis. In the healthy mammalian organism, all of these stimulatory actions of α7nAChR are balanced by the α4β2nAChR-regulated inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), that blocks adenylyl cyclase as well as neurotrophic factors. In a smoker, α4β2nAChR is desensitized, an effect enhanced by oestrogens. The resulting deficit in GABA leads to unchecked tumour angiogenesis and neurogenesis stimulated by α7nAChR. AC, acetylcholine.
expression levels of the main cancer-stimulating receptor (α7nAChR) and the main cancer-inhibiting receptor (α4nAChR) as well as GABA in target organs such as lung, pancreas and colon by imaging technologies. Information gained by these tests could be complemented by determination of cAMP in blood cells. Individuals with α7nAChR overexpression accompanied by decreased systemic cAMP may benefit from cancer intervention with agents that increase cAMP. Agents that increase cAMP by inhibiting the enzyme phosphodiesterase are currently used for the treatment of COPD and other chronic inflammatory diseases<sup>72</sup>, and this class of agents may be highly beneficial for the prevention and adjuvant therapy of SCLC in smokers (FIG. 3). However, the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors in an individual destined to develop cAMP-stimulated cancers (FIG. 5) may have detrimental effects because it would promote tumour development. Agonists of receptors coupled to the stimulatory G protein Gα<sub>s</sub> may have similar beneficial effects on SCLC development and progression owing to an adenylyl cyclase-mediated increase in cAMP but would be ill-advised in individuals with cAMP-stimulated cancers. By contrast, individuals with reduced expression levels of α4nAChR and GABA accompanied by increased systemic cAMP (FIG. 5) may benefit from cancer intervention treatments with GABA or pharmacological GABAB receptor agonists (FIGS 5,6). In either case, nAChR expression and levels of GABA and cAMP would need to be periodically monitored and treatments adjusted as needed. Ideally, blood cAMP levels would be monitored by the patient on a regular basis, similarly to the testing of blood glucose levels in diabetic patients.

Many dietary supplements, herbal medicines, foods and beverages may significantly modulate cAMP or GABA. For example, tea and its constituents caffeine and theophylline increase cAMP by inhibiting phosphodiesterases and significantly inhibit the growth of SCLC *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>60,76</sup>, whereas they stimulate small-airway-derived PAC cells *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>76,117,118</sup>. Signalling through cAMP is also stimulated through as yet unknown mechanisms by β-carotene and several retinoids<sup>119–121</sup>. On the other hand, fruits and plants, including vegetables, rice and grains, contain GABA. Blue grapes and red wine are particularly rich in GABA<sup>122</sup> and this may contribute to the reported cancer-preventive effects of red wine<sup>123,124</sup>.

In summary, strategies for marker-guided cancer intervention that targets nAChRs and their effectors seems promising. However, current knowledge of the biology of nAChRs is almost exclusively based on studies with nicotine in brain cells. It is to be expected that nAChR modulation is more severe in tissues with direct contact to tobacco smoke and higher local concentrations of nicotine and nitrosamines. It is also not clear whether any of the structurally related metabolites of NNN or NNK interact with nAChRs. Moreover, the modulating effects of nicotine replacement therapy and second-hand smoke on nAChRs require investigation. Finally, with the exception of the downregulation of the α4nAChR by oestrogens<sup>29</sup>, the potential modulation of nAChRs by non-tobacco risk factors for cancer is unknown and requires further study.
