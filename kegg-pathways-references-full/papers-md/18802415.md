Abstract | Circadian cycles affect a variety of physiological processes, and disruptions of normal circadian biology therefore have the potential to influence a range of disease-related pathways. The genetic basis of circadian rhythms is well studied in model organisms and, more recently, studies of the genetic basis of circadian disorders has confirmed the conservation of key players in circadian biology from invertebrates to humans. In addition, important advances have been made in understanding how these molecules influence physiological functions in tissues throughout the body. Together, these studies set the scene for applying our knowledge of circadian biology to the understanding and treatment of a range of human diseases, including cancer and metabolic and behavioural disorders.

Circadian rhythms control a variety of biological processes in living systems, ranging from bacteria to humans ${}^{1,2}$. Perhaps the most obvious function regulated by circadian rhythms is the daily sleep and wake cycle in animals. However, many other physiological processes are regulated by circadian rhythms, including body temperature, feeding behaviour, hormone secretion, drug and xenobiotic metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and cell-cycle progression. When circadian cycles are disrupted, either by genetic or environmental insults, disorders of diverse physiological processes can occur ${}^{3}$. Links between circadian physiology and other physiological processes therefore have implications for human biology because it is likely that genetic variation in circadian clock genes can contribute significantly to physiological variation, and therefore potentially to variation in disease susceptibility. In addition, in modern societies, humans are increasingly ignoring natural circadian cues, so it is important to understand how the resulting perturbations of our circadian biology might affect our physiology and susceptibility to disease — both to understand the disease processes and to identify new targets for treatment.

In this Review, we bring together findings from recent studies that have begun to provide a molecular understanding of how circadian biology influences physiological processes that are relevant to human disease. We first briefly describe the generally accepted models of how our circadian rhythms are regulated at the neural, genetic and molecular levels, an understanding that has come from extensive work in model organisms. We then highlight recent findings from genetic studies of human circadian disorders, which illustrate the striking conservation of clock-gene function in model organisms and humans, and we also highlight the implications of human clock-gene variation for human circadian biology. We will also discuss recent studies that have revealed a number of surprisingly direct molecular links with the cell cycle, metabolism and behavioural disorders, providing a basis for understanding how the circadian system impinges on diverse aspects of mammalian physiology that are of relevance for human diseases and their treatment, including regenerative medicine and cancer, obesity and diabetes, and mental health.

Neural control of mammalian circadian rhythms

The ability of living systems to sustain approximately 24-hour rhythms in the absence of environmental cues shows that most daily oscillations are not responses to the diurnal cycle, but rather are generated by an internal clock (BOX 1). The ‘master’ internal clock in mammals is located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus, or SCN — this is composed of bilateral nuclei containing approximately 10,000 neurons each ${}^{4,5}$ (FIG. 1). The primary environmental synchronizer of circadian rhythms in mammals is the daily light–dark cycle.

Box 1 | Circadian terminology and activity rhythms

In the natural environment, an organism’s circadian system synchronizes a broad array of biological processes and behaviour — such as sleep–wake cycle, periodic activity bouts and blood hormone levels — to the prevailing light–dark cycle by phase advancing or phase delaying these daily rhythms. The time interval between phase reference points (for example, two peaks) is called the period. Expression of endogenous circadian rhythm when subjects are isolated from external cues, such as the light cycle, is described as free running. The timing of a reference point in the cycle (for example, the peak) relative to a fixed event (for example, the beginning of the night phase) is known as the phase. The difference in the level between peak and trough values of the rhythm is referred to as the amplitude (for example, the amount of activity or the level of circadian gene expression either in mRNA or protein levels).

To examine the effects of genetic disruption on behavioural circadian rhythms, long-term activity measurements are the most widely used method. When housed in a light–dark cycle, a normal mouse will exhibit nocturnal behaviour by consolidating most of its activity in the night (or dark) interval of the 24-hour day. When rodents are placed in constant darkness for extended periods of time, free-running circadian behaviour persists and activity remains consolidated to the subjective night; however, the experimentally determined day length is usually different from 24 hours. For example, the internal clock in the inbred C57BL/6J strain of mice runs with an extremely precise free-running period of 23.6 hours. When individual genes involved in circadian rhythms are disrupted in mice, changes in free-running period, phase or amplitude of rhythms can be observed.

takes approximately 24 hours to complete; however, little is known about the stoichiometry and kinetics of this feedback loop. In addition to the primary feedback loop, there is a second negative-feedback loop involving the nuclear hormone receptor Rev-erba, which is a direct target of CLOCK–BMAL1 and which strongly represses *Bmal1* transcription ${}^{15,16}$. This secondary loop is not essential, but is thought to add robustness to the molecular clock. Finally, there are a number of other candidate clock components such as *Timeless*, *Dec1*, *Dec2* and *E4bp4* (reviewed in REF. 2), the roles of which have not yet been clearly defined.

Recent work shows that post-translational modification and degradation of circadian clock proteins are crucial steps for determining circadian periodicity of the clock ${}^{14,17}$. As seen previously in *Drosophila*, mammalian PER1 and PER2 proteins are progressively phosphorylated as they accumulate during the late afternoon and night. Key kinases involved in PER and CRY phosphorylation are casein kinase 1 delta (*CSNK1D*) and *CSNK1E*. The hamster *tau* mutant has a short 20-hour circadian period, which is caused by an A178C missense mutation in *Csnk1e* leading to a dominant negative mutant allele ${}^{18}$; this and further studies of this mutant have revealed a key role for CSNK1E and protein phosphorylation in regulating circadian periodicity in mammals ${}^{19}$. One of the roles for phosphorylation of clock proteins is to target them for polyubiquitylation and degradation by the 26S proteasomal pathway. *In vitro* studies have suggested that the β-TrCP1 and FBXL3 E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes directly target the PER and CRY proteins, respectively, for degradation ${}^{20-24}$. Two recent studies have demonstrated that mutations in the *Fbxl3* gene result in long-period phenotypes in mice, owing to a defect in targeting CRY1 and CRY2 for degradation ${}^{24,25}$. Thus, the turnover of PER and CRY, respectively, are specifically regulated by two different SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes.

Recent work has shown that circadian transcription of CLOCK–BMAL1 target genes is accompanied by circadian changes in histone H3 acetylation and chromatin remodelling ${}^{26}$. Circadian transcription of the mouse D site albumin promoter binding protein gene (*Dbp*) is accompanied by rhythmic binding of CLOCK–BMAL1 to E-box *cis*-regulatory elements, acetylation of lysine 9 of histone H3, trimethylation of lysine 4 of histone H3, and a reduction in histone density ${}^{27}$. Interestingly, the CLOCK protein has been shown to possess histone acetyltransferase activity ${}^{28}$, and can acetylate its partner, BMAL1, on lysine 537 (REF. 29). The histone deacetylase sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) interacts with CLOCK and can deacetylate lysine 537 of BMAL1 as well as lysine 9 and 14 of histone H3 (REF. 30). SIRT1 is expressed in a circadian manner and regulates circadian gene expression of *Bmal1*, RAR-related orphan receptor gamma (*Rorc*), *Per2* and *Cry1* through interaction with CLOCK–BMAL1 and through deacetylation and degradation of PER2 (REF. 31). Thus, chromatin remodelling is intimately linked to transcription driven by CLOCK–BMAL1, both within the core clock autoregulatory feedback loop as well as in downstream target genes of the CLOCK–BMAL1

Molecular components of the circadian clock

The circadian clock mechanism involves a cell-autonomous transcription–translation feedback loop comprised of a core set of genes that are highly conserved among animals ${}^{1,2}$. In mammals, the circadian clock is composed of a primary negative-feedback loop involving the genes circadian locomoter output cycles kaput (*Clock*; and its paralogue neuronal PAS domain protein 2, *Npas2*), *Bmal1* (also known as aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator-like; *Arntl*), period homologue 1 (*Per1*), *Per2*, Cryptochrome 1 (*Cry1*) and *Cry2* (FIG. 2). During the day, the basic helix-loop-helix PAS-domain containing transcription factor CLOCK (or NPAS2) interact with BMAL1 to activate transcription of the *Per* and *Cry* genes, resulting in high levels of these transcripts. The resulting PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize, translocate to the nucleus and interact with the CLOCK–BMAL1 complex to inhibit their own transcription ${}^{14}$. During the night, the PER–CRY repressor complex is degraded, and CLOCK–BMAL1 can then activate a new cycle of transcription. The entire cycle

complex. Because SIRT1 is an NAD⁺-dependent histone deacetylase, it will be interesting to see if this pathway provides a link between cellular metabolism and the circadian clock.

### Genetics of human circadian disorders

Given the molecular insights of the circadian clock mechanism from model organisms, an obvious question concerns the conservation and possible role of clock genes in human biology. Perhaps the most obvious circadian rhythm in humans is the daily pattern of sleep and wakefulness³²,³³ (BOX 2). According to the well accepted model of sleep regulation, the timing of sleep and wakefulness is controlled by two processes: a sleep homeostatic process that underlies the rise of sleep propensity during wakefulness and its dissipation during sleep, and a circadian process that determines the thresholds for switching between sleep and wake³⁴. Among the human sleep disorders, a subset of insomnias has been clearly linked to circadian alterations in the timing of sleep. These sleep disorders are known as advanced sleep phase syndrome, delayed sleep phase syndrome (DSPS), non-24-hour sleep–wake syndrome and irregular sleep–wake pattern³⁵. In an effort to understand the genetic basis of human circadian sleep disorders, both genetic linkage and association studies have been undertaken.

#### Familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome

To date, there is one clearly established Mendelian circadian rhythm disorder in humans, known as familial advanced sleep-phase syndrome (FASPS)³⁶,³⁷. FASPS is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and is characterized by persistent 3–4-hour advanced sleep onsets and awakening times relative to conventional and desired times³⁶,³⁷. When patients are allowed to choose their preferred sleep schedule, sleep quality and duration are normal for age; only under the constraints of a forced bedtime and wake-time schedule does one become aware of this disorder. Thus, FASPS is thought to result from an abnormal phase position of the circadian cycle relative to the desired sleep–wake schedule. FASPS was the first disorder to link known core clock genes directly with human circadian sleep disorders (Supplementary information S1 (table)).

Using linkage analysis, Toh and colleagues found that the missense mutation S662G in human PER2 cosegregated with FASPS³⁸. Interestingly, the S662G mutation occurs in a phosphorylation site within a CSNK1-binding domain of PER2. Biochemical analysis revealed decreased phosphorylation by CSNK1E of a PER2 peptide containing this site. On the basis of these results from the S662G PER2 mutation, and from other results from the hamster tau mutation in Csnk1e, it was thought that decreased phosphorylation of PER could stabilize PER, leading to a premature accumulation of PER and a shortening of period. However, a recent report by Xu et al. showed that transgenic mice expressing human PER2 with the S662G mutation revealed an unexpected reduction of mouse and human PER2 (REF. 39). These authors propose that PER2 is normally a positive regulator of its own transcription, and therefore the S662G

Figure 1 | A schematic diagram of the suprachiasmatic nucleus and its input and output pathways. The mammalian circadian pacemaker in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is organized into two major subdivisions, the core and the shell. The core region of the SCN receives information about the daily light cycle through the retinohypothalamic tract (RHT). Both neuronal and humoral signals function as output signals from the SCN to other regions of the brain and the periphery. The SCN output pathways are responsible for proper timing of diverse physiological functions, including hormone release, sleep–wake cycle, feeding behaviour, and thermoregulation. The SCN output to the subparaventricular zone (sPVz) is relayed to the medial preoptic region (MPO) to control circadian rhythms of body temperature, and a separate projection through the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH) controls daily hormone secretion through the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and sleep–wake cycles through the lateral hypothalamus (LH) and ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO).

Figure 2 | The mammalian circadian clock is composed of a transcriptional-translational feedback network. The circadian clock mechanism involves transcription-translation feedback loops comprised of a set of core clock genes. In mammals, the circadian clock is composed of a primary negative feedback loop involving the genes, Clock (and its paralogue neuronal PAS domain protein 2, Npas2), Bmal1, period homologue 1 (Per1), Per2, cryptochrome 1 (Cry1) and Cry2. CLOCK (or NPAS2) and BMAL1 are basic helix-loop-helix PAS-domain containing transcription factors that activate transcription of the Per and Cry genes. The resulting PER and CRY proteins heterodimerize, translocate to the nucleus and interact with the CLOCK-BMAL1 complex to inhibit their own transcription. After a period of time, the PER-CRY repressor complex is degraded and CLOCK-BMAL1 can then activate a new cycle of transcription. The secondary autoregulatory feedback loop is composed of Rev-erba, which is a direct target of the CLOCK-BMAL1 transcription activator complex. REV-ERBA feeds back to repress Bmal1 transcription and competes with a retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) to bind ROR response elements (RREs) in the Bmal1 promoter. In addition to the transcriptional activators and repressors, post-translational modification and degradation of circadian clock proteins are crucial steps for determining circadian periodicity. Key kinases for PER (and CRY) phosphorylation are casein kinase 1 delta (CSNK1D) and CSNK1E. One of the roles for phosphorylation of clock proteins is to target them for polyubiquitylation and degradation by the 26S proteosomal pathway.

mutation causes a decrease in the level of Per2 transcription because the level of PER2 is decreased by increased turnover of PER2 (REF. 39). However, independent work by Vanselow and colleagues suggests that the turnover of PER2 is not significantly affected by the S662G mutation, and that the FASPS mutation actually reduces the nuclear retention of PER2 (REF. 40). As indicated above, the hamster tau mutation in CSNK1E also does not lead to a stabilization of PER as initially thought, but rather leads to a destabilization of PER by enhancing the turnover and degradation of PER by the proteasome⁴¹. Thus, the molecular basis of this form of FASPS seems

Box 2 | Phenotyping methods to ascertain circadian rhythm defects

Individual daily rest–activity rhythm parameters in humans can be measured with relative ease by a wrist actigraph, a small watch-like monitor that detects movements, used in conjunction with a sleep log or diary recorded by the subject<sup>131</sup>. Other phenotypic measures have been valuable in identifying individuals with an altered sleep–wake cycle. These include self-report questionnaires, such as the Horne–Östberg morningness–eveningness questionnaire (MEQ)<sup>132</sup>, which is designed to quantitatively associate individuals to morning type (M type) or evening type (E type) tendency of preferred activity time. The Horne–Östberg MEQ score has been shown to correlate well with an individual’s intrinsic circadian period<sup>133</sup> and has been shown to be effective in identifying individuals and families with extreme diurnal preference<sup>36,37</sup>. Additional physiological measures such as core body temperature, plasma melatonin and salivary measures of dim-light melatonin-onset time have proven useful in determining the phase of the circadian clock with respect to the rest–activity cycle. Another self-report questionnaire, the Munich ChronoType, has been recently developed to include additional parameters to refine the assessment of an individual’s diurnal preference and, therefore, to facilitate evaluation of an individual’s genetic chronotype<sup>32,33</sup>.

S408N in the CSNK1E gene, which is in a putative phosphoacceptor site, might have a protective role in the development of DSPS as well as non-24-hour sleep–wake syndrome (in which loss of circadian regulation of sleep occurs)<sup>49</sup>. A SNP in the 5′-UTR of PER2 has also been reported to be associated with morning preferences<sup>50</sup>. In both these cases the functional consequences of these sequence variants have not been reported and thus we do not understand their mechanism.

One of the more interesting sequence variants is a variable-number tandem-repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in the PER3 gene, which encodes 18 amino acids repeating either four times (PER3-4 allele) or five times (PER3-5 allele); this coding region is predicted to harbour potential CSNK1 phosphorylation sites, which have not been analysed<sup>51</sup>. The shorter VNTR allele has been shown to occur with higher frequency in a study of 48 Japanese patients with DSPS<sup>51</sup>. In a sample from an English population, one study showed that homozygosity for the shorter repeat allele (PER3-4/4) was strongly associated with DSPS<sup>51</sup>. However, in contrast to this finding, a study in a Brazilian population found that the frequency of the longer allele was higher in DSPS patients<sup>52</sup>. It has been proposed that the differences in the latitude of the two cities, which considerably influences temperature, the length of days throughout the year and solar intensity, might have a role in the influence of PER3 polymorphisms in DSPS<sup>52</sup>. Replication of this finding in equivalent latitudes is necessary to determine whether these associations are robust, and if so whether there will be significant gene–environment interactions for circadian traits in humans as seen in *Drosophila*<sup>53</sup>.

The PER3 VNTR polymorphism might also contribute to sleep homeostasis; differences in sleep–wake structure, sleep propensity and cognitive performance during sleep loss were noted between individuals who are homozygous for the shorter or longer allele in the general population<sup>54</sup>. It is noteworthy that mouse models of other clock genes, such as *Clock*, *Cry1*, *Cry2*, *Npas2*, *Dbp* and *Bmal1*, also have alterations in sleep duration and/or homeostasis<sup>55–59</sup>. Thus, in addition to the known phenotypic links between the circadian system and sleep, there are many examples in which circadian clock genes can clearly affect the circadian control of sleep as well as the homeostatic sleep system. Given the interdependent relationships between the circadian and sleep systems, it will be important in future work to determine whether sleep and circadian phenotypes can be clearly distinguished at the genetic level. That is, can we find genes that selectively regulate sleep homeostasis independently of circadian rhythms and vice versa? Perhaps the only known genes that are definitively associated with sleep independent of the circadian system thus far are those genes causing narcolepsy, in which the loss of hypocretin (orexin) ligand or hypocretin (orexin) receptor 2 cause a defect in sleep-stage entry into rapid eye movement (REM) sleep<sup>60,61</sup>. Inroads into the genetics of sleep are emerging in *Drosophila*<sup>62,63</sup>, but there is still a paucity of work on the genetics of sleep in mammalian animal models — a field in which there are excellent opportunities for genetic analysis<sup>64,65</sup>.

to be caused by an increased turnover of nuclear PER2, either by enhanced degradation or by reduced nuclear retention of PER.

Given that expression of daily circadian rhythms involves a repertoire of circadian clock genes, it is not surprising to observe genetic heterogeneity in FASPS. Several independent studies of FASPS have failed to identify mutations in *PER2* (REFS 37,42). Consistent with these observations, Xu and colleagues have identified a mutation in CSNK1D, a paralogue of CSNK1E, in FASPS using candidate gene approaches<sup>43</sup>. Interestingly, although a transgenic mouse model carrying the human mutation T44A showed a shortened circadian period as expected, a *Drosophila* model carrying the same mutant transgene showed a lengthened circadian period, suggesting different regulatory mechanisms between these species. It will be of great interest to see whether additional mutations in core clock genes will be found to underlie the additional cases of FASPS. The fact that the first two cases of FASPS are caused by mutations in core circadian clock genes is remarkable and strongly suggests that the clock mechanism of humans is highly conserved with that observed in rodent animal models.

Delayed sleep phase syndrome and circadian rhythm disorders with a complex genetic basis. In humans, DSPS is the most common circadian rhythm sleep disorder in the general population<sup>35</sup>. It is characterized by a chronic inability to fall asleep or awaken at the desired ‘normal’ times of day; the average onset of sleep in individuals with DSPS occurs in the early morning (3 am to 6 am) and their usual rise time occurs in the late morning to early afternoon (11 am to 2 pm). Although they are rare, familial cases of DSPS have been described, suggesting that Mendelian inheritance of DSPS might exist<sup>44,45</sup>. Several association studies of DSPS with sequence variants of known circadian genes have been reported. Both significant association and lack of association with the T3111C polymorphism in the 3′UTR of *CLOCK* have been reported for DSPS and for diurnal preference<sup>45–48</sup>. One study reported that the amino-acid substitution

In future work it will be important to integrate our knowledge of circadian mechanisms in humans so that the ‘chronotype’ of individuals can be more easily and reliably assessed<sup>33</sup> (BOX 3). Because there is such wide diversity in diurnal preference among people and because our 24-hour society demands such temporal variability in schedules, it likely that the genetically programmed internal clock of humans will be in conflict with modern society (phase desynchrony)<sup>33</sup>. Such desynchrony with the external world and the consequential internal desynchrony of the circadian system can contribute significantly to the morbidity and the well-being of human health<sup>3,66</sup>. If the chronotype of an individual can be used to inform and optimize adaptation to the 24-hour society, then it is likely that an understanding of clock genetics in humans should have direct application: a clock gene allelic profile should be predictive of an individual’s genetically programmed clock, and this

**Box 3 | In vitro methods to dissect human circadian rhythm disorders**

A major impediment in the study of human circadian rhythms is the difficulty and expense of assessing circadian rhythms in people. Because circadian clocks must be studied in temporal isolation, human circadian studies have demanded strict requirements of isolating subjects from environmental cues under constant conditions for a prolonged period of time<sup>134,135</sup>. Unlike a mouse, it is difficult to convince a person to spend weeks living in temporal isolation. Thus, only a few investigators have had the resources and facilities necessary for such experiments. Therefore, surrogate measurements for assessing human circadian rhythms are essential. These have taken two forms. The first approach has been to assess ‘diurnal preference’ or ‘chronotype’ of subjects using questionnaires, hormonal markers and actigraphy to measure phase of entrainment of circadian rhythms while living in the real world<sup>32,131,132,136</sup>. A second approach has been to develop cell-based and molecular methods to assess circadian rhythms in humans by biopsy or blood sample<sup>137</sup>. In animal models, precise period and phase estimates of circadian rhythms can be made by real-time measurements using circadian reporter genes in cultured cells<sup>70,71,73</sup>. In humans, the challenge is to develop methods that are effective and robust in defining inter-individual phenotypic differences, but also that would be sufficiently cost-effective to screen large number of subjects.

Recently, Brown and colleagues<sup>137</sup> developed a skin biopsy and cell-culture method to measure inter-individual differences in circadian rhythms. By introducing a stable lentiviral-luciferase circadian reporter into cultured human fibroblasts, the authors showed that inter-individual differences of circadian period length were much more variable than different biopsies of the same individual. The same reporter system was implemented using known mouse circadian mutants and it was found that circadian period measurements from fibroblast cultures were correlated with the behavioural rhythms of circadian clock mutants<sup>137</sup>. Brown and colleagues have gone on to show that there are individual differences in circadian amplitude and phase-resetting responses in fibroblasts from human subjects, and that these differences are correlated with their diurnal phase preferences<sup>138</sup>. Thus, cell-based assessments of circadian rhythms in fibroblast biopsies seem to be an excellent surrogate method to assess circadian periodicity in humans. It is important to note, however, that a recent study that examined different period (*Per*) and cryptochrome (*Cry*) mutant mice has shown that suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neuronal coupling can compensate for cell-autonomous genetic defects<sup>139</sup>. The authors show that whereas fibroblasts and isolated SCN neurons derived from *Per1*<sup>−/−</sup> and *Cry1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice exhibited defective expression of the Per2–luciferase fusion gene (*Per2*::luciferase), intact SCN explants from the same mice showed robust oscillation of *Per2*::luciferase expression. Therefore, in some cases examination of primary fibroblasts from patients with suspected circadian disorders might overestimate the effect of genetic mutations on circadian rhythms at the behavioural level. Nonetheless, the technique should be valuable in identifying affected individuals, and indeed might be a more sensitive indicator of genetic variants in human circadian disorders.


information could then be used to optimize an individual’s schedule and treatment regime for many disorders<sup>66</sup>.

**Peripheral clocks and tissue-specific control**

Following the initial discovery of circadian clock genes in mammals, it became clear that the expression of these genes was ubiquitous and that the majority of tissues throughout the body expressed circadian oscillations in gene expression<sup>67–69</sup> (FIG. 3). Indeed, it is now well established that almost every tissue in mammals has the capacity for generating circadian oscillations<sup>70,71</sup>. Using single-cell measurements of fibroblasts engineered with either circadian-driven bioluminescent or fluorescent reporter genes, cell-autonomous circadian rhythms can be observed that persist with undiminished amplitude for many days *in vitro*<sup>72,73</sup>. Interestingly, there is no evidence for coupling of these cell-autonomous circadian oscillators in fibroblasts. The existence of self-sustained circadian oscillators in peripheral tissues and cells raises a number of organizational questions. What is the role of these peripheral oscillators and how are they coordinated in the intact organism? Evidence suggests that peripheral oscillators are normally entrained by the SCN pacemaker, but that they are only weakly coupled to the SCN. For example, experimentally inducing ‘jet lag’ in rodents by advancing or delaying the light cycle by 6 hours reveals that the SCN can reset rapidly to these shifts, while resynchrony of peripheral oscillators can take over a week<sup>70</sup>. Proximal cues such as feeding can override phase control of peripheral oscillators by the SCN under conditions of restricted feeding<sup>74,75</sup>. It is thought that circulating factors such as glucocorticoids and the circadian variation in body temperature might function as entraining signals for peripheral clocks<sup>76,77</sup>. Thus, peripheral clocks are controlled at multiple levels. They receive entraining cues centrally from the SCN, and they have their own local cell-autonomous oscillators that can operate independently of the SCN.

The relative role of central versus local control of circadian rhythms in peripheral tissues can be addressed by tissue-specific conditional regulation of circadian gene expression in transgenic mouse models. For the regulation of circadian behavioural rhythms, it is clear that central SCN control is sufficient to generate circadian rhythmicity. For example, in *Bmal1*-null mutant mice, circadian rhythms of behaviour are abolished<sup>78</sup>; however, transgenic expression of *Bmal1* in the brain and SCN is sufficient to rescue circadian rhythms of behaviour<sup>79</sup>. Interestingly, other phenotypic effects of the *Bmal1*-null mutation (for example, activity levels, morbidity and body-weight loss) cannot be rescued by expression of *Bmal1* in the brain, but can be rescued by transgenic expression in skeletal muscle<sup>79</sup>. These experiments illustrate that the circadian behavioural effects of the *Bmal1* mutation can be partitioned from other physiological effects by tissue-specific rescue, and the results show that *Bmal1* influences many other functions beyond circadian rhythmicity. Whether these pleiotropic effects of *Bmal1* are a consequence of the peripheral circadian function of *Bmal1* or whether they reflect independent functions remains to be determined.

REVIEW S

To address the role of local cell-autonomous oscillators in the liver, Kornmann and colleagues<sup>80</sup> used conditional overexpression of Rev-erba in the liver to knock down Bmal1 in hepatocytes while maintaining normal circadian function in the rest of the animal. Disruption of cell-autonomous clocks in the liver led to the abolition of cycling of the majority of genes *in vivo*; however, a subset of genes (including Per2, Nocturnin and members of the heat shock protein family) continued oscillating, suggesting that these genes might be responding to rhythmic systemic cues generated by SCN-driven rhythmic behaviour of the animal<sup>80</sup>. These experiments indicate that cell-autonomous oscillators in the liver have a dominant role in the local control of circadian gene expression in these cells. However, systemic cues *in vivo* can still drive rhythms in some genes in hepatocytes, presumably to entrain these peripheral oscillators.

Taken together, the discovery of cell-autonomous circadian oscillators throughout the body of mammals has radically changed our view of the circadian system. Instead of a model in which a dominant pacemaker in the SCN alone generates and drives rhythms throughout the organism, we now appreciate that almost every cell and tissue in the body contains circadian oscillators and that there is a hierarchy of control in which the SCN acts as a coordinator or synchronizer by centrally regulating activity, feeding and body-temperature rhythms, all of which can then influence the phase of cell-autonomous oscillators in the periphery.

**Interaction with physiological processes**

In addition to their primary role in the generation of circadian rhythms, recent work has shown that circadian clock genes can affect a wide variety of other physiological processes<sup>81–83</sup> (Supplementary information S2 (table)). The circadian system regulates these processes in two major ways. First, outputs from the circadian clock originating either centrally from the SCN or locally from cell-autonomous oscillators regulate key components in physiological pathways in a rhythmic fashion to drive circadian rhythms in these pathways. Second, the core circadian clock components themselves seem to be elements of cellular pathways that are not traditionally thought to be under circadian regulation, which might indicate additional roles for these genes. Emerging examples of circadian regulation of physiological pathways include diverse aspects of cellular metabolism, cell growth and DNA-damage control, xenobiotic responses, and the modulation of behavioural responses to drugs and alcohol.

**Circadian clocks and metabolism.** Perhaps the most striking discovery to be made from circadian gene profiling experiments was the observation that a significant fraction of the transcriptome (3–10%) is under circadian regulation and that the majority of the pathways regulated by the clock are embedded in fundamental metabolic pathways<sup>67</sup>. In the SCN, genes involved in protein biosynthesis and trafficking, including ribosomal synthesis, translation initiation, folding, targeting, post-translational modification and transport, were under coordinated circadian control. In addition, genes involved in energy metabolism, the redox state of the cell and cell signalling also showed circadian variation in their steady-state message levels. In the liver, basic cellular pathways such as glycolysis, fatty-acid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and xenobiotic and intermediate metabolism were under circadian regulation. Importantly, rate-limiting steps in these various pathways were key sites of circadian control, highlighting the fundamental role that circadian clocks have in cellular and organismal physiology. Recent gene expression analysis of the nuclear receptor family has shown that of the 49 nuclear receptors in mice, 28 of them display tissue-specific circadian rhythms in various tissues<sup>84</sup>. Given the diverse roles nuclear receptors have in regulating metabolism, the circadian control of nuclear-receptor expression provides a key nodal

Although there has been evidence for circadian modulation of metabolism, the pervasiveness of circadian control at a global level was not appreciated. These observations, coupled with the cell autonomy of circadian oscillators in the majority of cells in the body, suggest that circadian regulation might be a fundamental housekeeping function of the cell.

In addition to the circadian control of metabolism, circadian mutant animal models have been found to have metabolic disorders (Supplementary information S2 (table)). For example, *Clock*<sup>Δ19</sup> mutant mice are hyperphagic and obese, and not only lose rhythms of core clock genes, but also have lower levels of hypocretin (orexin) and ghrelin neuropeptide gene expression in the arcuate nucleus<sup>85</sup>. As a result, *Clock*<sup>Δ19</sup> mice exhibit metabolic syndrome with hyperlipidaemia, hepatic steatosis, hyperglycaemia and hypoinsulinaemia. A preliminary study in humans suggests that *CLOCK* polymorphisms might be associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome<sup>86</sup>. In addition, both *Clock*<sup>Δ19</sup> and *Bmal1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice are hypersensitive to insulin shock, suggesting a direct role for the molecular circadian clock in regulating glucose homeostasis<sup>87</sup>. In humans, *BMAL1* has been associated with susceptibility to hypertension and type 2 diabetes<sup>88</sup>. In addition, BMAL1 seems to be involved in the control of adipogenesis and lipid metabolism in adipocytes<sup>89</sup>. During adipose differentiation, *Bmal1* is strongly induced in 3T3-L1 cells (a mouse embryonic fibroblast adipose-like cell line) and both gain-of-function and loss-of-function experiments support a crucial role for *Bmal1* in this pathway. *Bmal1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice also exhibit numerous other phenotypes, including decreased adult body-weight and activity levels, increased tendon calcification, increased sleep duration and fragmentation, and sarcopaenia<sup>58,78,90,91</sup>. Some of these might indicate a general tendency to age quicker than wild-type mice<sup>91</sup>, but also result from the loss of tissue-specific BMAL1 functions<sup>79</sup>. Additional abnormalities have been characterized in other circadian mutants, for example, the CSNK1E (*tau*) mutant hamster exhibits reduced growth rate and elevated metabolic rate<sup>92,93</sup>. In addition, mice deficient in *Nocturnin*, a gene with robust circadian expression that encodes a poly(A) deadenylase, are resistant to diet-induced obesity<sup>94</sup>. Thus, in these genetic models, we see a more direct link between circadian clock genes and metabolism. Mutations in a number of core clock genes are also associated with metabolic defects. Whether these effects are caused by alterations in circadian rhythmicity *per se*, or whether they are due to transcriptional targets of CLOCK and BMAL1 that are independent of the circadian clock system remains to be determined.

feeding entrains these oscillators by metabolic pathways, a hypothetical mechanism for how metabolism could have direct access to the clock mechanism has been proposed by McKnight and colleagues<sup>82</sup>. For example, in biochemical experiments it can be shown that the reduced forms of the metabolic products NADH and NADPH modulate CLOCK–BMAL1 and NPAS2–BMAL1 heterodimers and enhance their binding to DNA, whereas the oxidized forms NAD and NADP diminish DNA binding<sup>95</sup>. In addition, the PAS domains of NPAS2 can bind haem, and carbon monoxide can regulate the DNA binding of NPAS2–BMAL1 dimers<sup>96</sup>. Recent work also shows that haem is the ligand for the circadian nuclear receptor, REV-ERBA<sup>97,98</sup>. To make things more complicated, haem biosynthesis is also under circadian regulation so these pathways seem to feedback on each other<sup>99</sup>. It will be important to determine whether these redox states and haem interactions are physiological and operate *in vivo*. If so, then fluctuations in cellular metabolism could directly influence the transcriptional activity of circadian clock components, which in turn regulate the expression of many metabolic pathways.

Finally, additional evidence for effects of metabolism on circadian rhythms is provided by experiments showing that alteration of metabolic state by genetic or environmental means can alter circadian rhythms in animals. For example, disruption of *Pgc1α*, a transcriptional co-activator involved in energy metabolism, is also associated with abnormal circadian rhythms of activity, temperature and metabolic rate in mice<sup>100</sup>. Interestingly, environmental modulators of metabolic state (for example, a high-fat diet) can subtly influence circadian period and the expression of cycling genes in mice<sup>101</sup>.

Taken together, it is clear that circadian clocks and metabolism are intimately linked and reflect adaptive responses of living systems to the cyclic environment (FIG. 4). Because metabolic processes vary with the physiological demands of the organism and many of these physiological demands occur on a daily basis, it is not surprising that direct circadian coordination of metabolism might have adaptive significance. On the other hand, disruption of the optimal tuning of rhythmic metabolic pathways could then have suboptimal consequences and important implications for metabolic disorders.

Circadian clocks and the cell cycle. As alluded to above, the cell cycle has been observed to be under circadian modulation in many organisms and the selective factor for such modulation might have been to escape from light and to restrict DNA replication to the night<sup>102</sup> (FIG. 5). Recently, it has been observed that some mutations in circadian clock components in mice can affect cell growth and proliferation, and in some cases can predispose mice to cancer. For example, in regenerating liver following partial hepatectomy in mice, Okamura and colleagues have shown that the circadian clock system controls cell-cycle related genes that modulate the activity of cyclin B1–CDC2 kinase, a key mitotic regulator<sup>103</sup>. Cry-deficient mice exhibit delayed rates of liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy and the expression profiles of Cyclin D1 (*CcnD1*) and *Wee1* are deregulated. Importantly, the

Figure 4 | Interactions between circadian and metabolic systems. Fundamental metabolic pathways such as glycolysis, fatty-acid metabolism, cholesterol biosynthesis, and xenobiotic and intermediate metabolism are all under circadian regulation. Metabolism can also have effects on circadian clocks; these effects include: NADH and NADPH, which can modulate CLOCK–BMAL1 and NPAS2–BMAL1 DNA binding; the PAS domains of NPAS2, which can bind haem and can be modulated by carbon monoxide; and haem can also be a ligand for the circadian nuclear receptor, REV-ERBA.

accelerate the growth rates of implanted tumours<sup>111</sup>. Thus, the circadian gene pathway can interact directly with cell-cycle pathways and can influence cell growth through physiological system-level interactions (FIG. 5).

### Circadian sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents

It has been known for many decades that the drug-induced toxicity (that is, the morbidity and mortality effects) of anti-cancer agents vary strikingly with time of administration<sup>66</sup>. Using the chemotherapeutic agent cyclophosphamide, we have recently reinvestigated this phenomenon and found that a treatment that causes 20% mortality when administered at dusk (between zeitgeber time (ZT) 10, that is, 10 hours after ‘lights on’, and ZT14) results in 100% mortality when administered at dawn (between ZT22 and ZT02)<sup>112</sup>. To test the role of clock genes in this response, we used mouse mutants that have disrupted circadian rhythms. Both the Clock and Bmal1 mouse mutants were hypersensitive to cyclophosphamide treatment, whereas Cry-deficient mice were resistant to the drug’s toxicity<sup>112</sup>. These unexpected results point to a CLOCK–BMAL1 target underlying the sensitivity to cyclophosphamide. Contrary to conventional wisdom, which portrays changes in pharmacokinetics with the time of day, there were no significant differences in the metabolism and turnover of cyclophosphamide that could explain the dramatic differences in circadian sensitivity. Instead, evidence suggests that the pharmacodynamic effects of cyclophosphamide-induced toxicity are correlated with CLOCK–BMAL1-dependent modulation of B cell survival. The elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying the circadian control of B cell survival will provide a rationale not only for adjusting the timing of chemotherapeutic treatment to be less toxic, but also for providing a basis for a search for pharmacological modulators of drug toxicity acting through circadian system regulators. This result might significantly increase the therapeutic index and reduce morbidity associated with anti-cancer treatment.

transcription of *Wee1* is circadian and seems to be a direct target of the CLOCK–BMAL1 transcriptional complex. Thus, in regenerating liver the expression of *Wee1* is co-regulated with *Per1*, and the entry of the cell cycle into M phase is suppressed during this time of day. This might provide a molecular mechanism coupling the circadian clock to the cell cycle. Similarly, the *Clock* mutant strongly affects the expression patterns of many cell-cycle related genes and leads to a reduction in cell proliferation in *Clock* mutant fibroblasts<sup>104</sup>.

In other work, Fu and Lee<sup>105</sup> have shown that *Per2* mutant mice are predisposed to cancer following gamma-radiation treatment and that the expression of myelocytomatosis oncogene (*Myc*) and *Ccnd1* are regulated by the CLOCK–BMAL1 or NPAS2–BMAL1 pathway. The *Per2* pathway involving *Myc* and *Ccnd1* also seems to be operative in leptin-dependent osteoblast proliferation in bone<sup>106</sup>. The *Per1* gene also has been linked to cell growth and DNA-damage control<sup>107</sup>, and overexpression of *Per1* sensitized cancer cells to DNA damage-induced apoptosis and caused significant growth reduction. The PER1 protein interacted with the checkpoint proteins ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) and checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2) (REF. 107), whereas related work has linked the timeless protein with CHK1 and the ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3 related and ATR interacting protein complex (ATR–ATRIP)<sup>108</sup>. Unexpectedly, activation of the DNA-damage pathway has been shown to be able to reset the phase of the circadian clock in cells and *in vivo*<sup>109,110</sup>. Thus, the circadian clock not only regulates key cell-cycle regulatory proteins, but can also be reset by DNA-damaging agents. Although these links between the circadian clock and the cell cycle occur at the molecular level, there is also evidence that abolition of circadian rhythms in the host by SCN lesions can

Thus, circadian rhythms and core clock components have crucial roles in many aspects of cell-cycle regulation and morbidity of chemotherapeutic agents. These results, combined with epidemiological studies examining the link between rotating shift work and cancer risk, suggest a significant association between circadian rhythm disruptions and abnormal cell growth<sup>113–115</sup>. Although some human studies also have shown the beneficial effects of timed chemotherapy delivery on both drug effectiveness and side-effects, translation to recommended clinical practices has not been generally adopted<sup>116,117</sup>. Further evidence that timed drug administration is beneficial will be needed to initiate this course of therapy for cancer treatment as well as therapies for a variety of other disorders. Indeed, recent work demonstrates that even haematopoietic stem-cell release is regulated by the circadian clock and that the efficacy of stem-cell transplantation can vary by as much as twofold to threefold depending on the time of day<sup>118</sup>. Thus, chemotherapy and stem-cell transplantation are two important targets for circadian optimization in clinical treatments in the future.

candidate-gene studies need to be replaced by unbiased genome-wide association studies that are sufficiently powered and replicated. Thus, much caution must be taken in interpreting the existing reports on association of circadian genes with phenotypes in humans.

**Perspectives**

The elucidation of the molecular mechanism of circadian clocks in model organisms has revealed striking conservation of genes regulating human circadian rhythms. Emerging genetic studies on human clock genes suggest that genetic variation in these genes might be associated with metabolic, sleep and mood disorders. Given the strong links between circadian components and diverse physiological processes in animal models, genetic variation in human clock genes could also contribute to phenotypic variation relevant to disease pathways, such as metabolic and mood disorders. As such, it will be important in future studies to consider the impact of circadian variation on the design and assessment of human phenotypes, whether normal or disease related. In addition, the clear role for circadian genes in sleep disorders such as FASPS provides new opportunities for addressing whether human circadian disorders and sleep disorders, as seen in model organisms, are also associated with metabolic, cell-cycle or mood disorders.

An important issue concerning the mechanism of action of circadian alterations on physiological and disease processes is whether they reflect a primary effect on circadian (that is, cyclic) function or modulation in pathways, or whether there might be functions of circadian clock components that are independent of the circadian system. These two scenarios could have important implications for therapeutic strategies because treatments or lifestyles that perturb the normal patterns of circadian behaviour could then have detrimental effects on metabolic and physiological pathways that are coordinated by the circadian system. Alternatively, if circadian clock proteins have other non-circadian functions, then the therapeutic strategies that target them would need to consider whether the non-circadian functions are involved in the physiological processes linked to circadian genes, or whether they are off-target sites for side-effects. In either case, delineating the mechanisms in which circadian clock gene products are linked to disease processes will be crucial for therapeutic interventions targeting the circadian system.

Finally, with the knowledge that circadian clocks are cell autonomous and distributed throughout the body, it is important to target both central and peripheral circadian oscillators for therapeutic intervention. Because the circadian clock is so intimately linked to cellular metabolism and cell proliferation, new therapeutic indications such as predisposition to type 2 diabetes and obesity might become amenable to treatments that modulate the circadian and sleep systems. Future exploration in these research areas, along with increased public awareness, might allow us to appropriately diagnose and treat human circadian disorders as well as improve lifestyle choices to best align our physiological systems with the daily clock.
