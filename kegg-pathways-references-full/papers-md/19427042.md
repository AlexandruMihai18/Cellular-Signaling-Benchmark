The ability of pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into all cell types of an organism has received widespread attention in basic and clinical research and holds tremendous potential for pharmacologic and medical applications. In this review, we provide an overview of the factors and pathways involved in pluripotency and discuss a possible mechanism underlying genetic reprogramming using defined transcription factors. We specifically address the association between core transcription factors (e.g., Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog) and the cellular machinery (e.g., chromatin remodeling complex, DNA methylation, microRNA, and X chromosome inactivation), which has an important role in cell fate determination.

Introduction

The classification of mammalian cells is based on a hierarchical organization of cellular differentiation, which determines the developmental potency of a cell: totipotency, pluripotency, multipotency, and unipotency [1] (Figure 1). Totipotency is the ability of a cell to differentiate into all cell types of an entire organism including the trophoblast lineage in a coordinated and highly complex manner. The only totipotent cells are the zygotes and blastomeres of the earliest stages of natural or cloned embryos, which implant into the uterus and subsequently develop into both embryonic and extraembryonic cell lineages.

Pluripotency is the ability of a cell to differentiate into all cell types of an organism excluding the trophoblast lineage. Pluripotent cells are present in early embryos, from which they are derived to establish cell lines *in vitro*. The five types of pluripotent stem cells known to date are embryonic stem (ES), embryonic germ (EG), embryonic carcinoma (EC), induced pluripotent stem (iPS), and multipotent germline stem (mGS) cells [2–4]. A recently discovered novel blastocyst-derived stem cell, FAB-SCs, might exist in a ‘partially pluripotent’ state, which can gain full pluripotency by the mere addition of growth factors (e.g., leukemia inhibitory factor [LIF] and bone morphogenetic protein [BMP]4) [5]. Although pluripotent cells normally do not develop into extraembryonic tissues (see Glossary), they can contribute to the germline in chimeras with support of extraembryonic tissues from fertilized embryos via morula aggregation or blastocyst injection.

Multipotency is the ability of a cell to differentiate along multiple cell lineages. Somatic stem cells that exhibit this feature are, for example, neural stem cells, which can differentiate into neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Unipotency is the ability of a cell to differentiate into only one cell type. Spermatogonial stem cells, for example, are unipotent because they can differentiate only into sperm *in vivo* [2].

Because pluripotent cells can differentiate into all cell types of an organism including germ cells and can be cultured for an extended period of time without losing their key characteristics, they are considered to be an ideal resource for therapeutic applications in regenerative medicine such as, for example, cell and tissue replacement in the treatment of degenerative diseases. However, little is known about the mechanism underlying cellular pluripotency. Recent studies have shown that factors such as microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors, and chromatin

Glossary

Active (Xa) and inactive (Xi) X chromosome: in female mammalian somatic cells, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated to achieve dosage compensation for X-linked genes. The X chromosome chosen as active or inactive is referred to as Xa or Xi, respectively.

Blastocyst injection: another technique for testing *in vivo* developmental ability of a certain type of cells. Cells for testing are injected into the blastocoel of normal blastocyst and transferred to the uterus of the foster mother.

Cell fusion: fusion between two different or same cells, which form tetraploid cells.

Chimera: an organism that originates from two or more embryos or cells.

Extraembryonic tissues: the tissues that do not contribute to embryos.

Germline contribution: contribution of a certain type of cells to germ cells after morula aggregation or blastocyst injection.

Heterochromatic state: compact state of chromatin that leads to transcriptional silencing of gene expression.

Inner cell mass (ICM): the mass of cells inside of the blastocyst. These cells contribute to all three germ layers including germ cells.

Morula aggregation: a technique for testing the *in vivo* developmental ability of a certain type of cells. Normal morula-stage embryos are aggregated with a mass of the cells and are transferred to the uterus of the foster mother. *In vivo* developmental potential of the cells aggregated with morula can be determined by checking their contribution in the chimeric embryos or pups.

Tetraploid complementation: a technique aggregating a tetraploid eight-cell-stage embryo with cells for testing. Resulting embryos are chimeras, which originate from cells aggregated with tetraploid embryo. Tetraploid embryos contribute only to extraembryonic tissues.

Tissues of all three germ layers: tissue of embryonic endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm lineage.

Trophectoderm: outer layer of blastocyst that is the last developmental stage of preimplantation embryo. These cells do not contribute to the embryo but to the extraembryonic tissue.

X inactivation specific transcript (*Xist*): *Xist* RNAs do not encode protein, but they cover the future inactive X chromosome, which results in a heterochromatic state of the X chromosome.

TRENDS in Pharmacological Sciences

Figure 1. Hierarchy of the developmental potential of mammalian cells. Totipotency is a feature of preimplantation embryos. ES cells derived from the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst are pluripotent cells, giving rise to all three germ layers and the germline under *in vivo* and *in vitro* differentiation. EG, EC and mGS cells derived from germline cells also exhibit pluripotent features. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, which are reprogrammed from differentiated somatic cells, are indistinguishable from ES cells in their pluripotent ability. A recently discovered novel blastocyst-derived stem cell, FAB-SCs, can obtain pluripotency after stimulated by LIF and BMP4; therefore, they have been suggested as a 'partial pluripotent' cell. Although multipotent and unipotent cells are restricted in their differentiation potential compared with pluripotent cells, they do have the ability for self-renewal. '?' denotes that there is no clear evidence for unipotent cell type for differentiated cells.

structure or chromatin modifiers and processes such as signaling pathways and DNA methylation have essential roles in maintaining the pluripotent state of ES cells [6–10]. Here, we review how pluripotency of ES cells is maintained and propose a cellular mechanism by which somatic cells are genetically reprogrammed to the pluripotent state using defined factors.

ES cells are the standard for pluripotent stem cells

To recapitulate, ES, EG, EC, iPS and mGS cells represent the five types of pluripotent stem cells known to date. EG and EC cells show a lower potential for multilineage differentiation and germline contribution; these cells also do not fully meet the most stringent criteria for pluripotency because they do not contribute to the development of whole embryos after tetraploid complementation [11]. Although mGS cells are referred to as ‘multipotent’ germ-line stem cells, we classify them as pluripotent cells because they contribute to germline development after blastocyst injection and to apparently normal 10.5 dpc embryos after tetraploid complementation [3]. Another stringent assay for pluripotency is germline transmission to second-generation chimeras, which provides proof for the transmission of functional germ cells. ES and iPS cells are the two types of pluripotent stem cells that fulfill all the criteria of pluripotency [12,13]. Therefore, non-germline-competent cells are classified as multipotent cells (e.g. EpiSCs), although the cells contribute to tissues of all three germ layers [14,15]. Pluripotent cells, particularly ES cells, express high levels of germ cell markers such as Stella, Fragilis, Vasa and c-Kit. Of note, F9 EC cells, which rarely contribute to germline transmission, express fivefold lower levels of germ cell markers (Do *et al.*, unpublished). Further studies are needed to determine whether there is an association between high germ cell marker levels and germline competency in pluripotent cells.

In addition to the mouse model, ES cells have also been derived from nonhuman primates and humans. These cells

have not been, or perhaps cannot be, proven to contribute to germline transmission, and the pluripotency of human ES cells has yet to be authenticated [1]. Therefore, in this review we concentrate on the mechanism underlying pluripotency in mouse ES cells because they are the standard of cellular pluripotency.

### Pluripotency and 'stemness'

Pluripotent stem cells are defined by the capacity for unlimited self-renewal, a quality usually referred to as 'stemness'. Speculation has arisen as to whether the self-renewal of pluripotent and somatic stem cells could be controlled by a similar set of 'stemness genes'. Three independent investigations examining gene-expression profiling in ES cells and two somatic stem cells (neural stem cells and hematopoietic stem cells) have shown that only one gene, *Itga6* (encoding integrin α6), is commonly expressed in all three stem-cell types [16–18]. This finding suggests that, although stemness is a property of both pluripotent and multipotent stem cells, different types of stem cells might exhibit either different mechanisms underlying self-renewal or low expression levels of stemness genes [16]. Therefore, a gene specific for one stem-cell type might not represent a stemness gene for another stem-cell type. For example, both Oct4 and Nanog are not expressed in somatic stem cells, but only Nanog is not expressed in spermatogonial stem cells.

### Transcription factors involved in the pluripotency of mouse ES cells

The transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog are the three core transcription factors involved in cellular pluripotency [19–21]. Oct4 and Nanog play an essential part in early development and maintenance of pluripotency, with their expression being restricted to early embryos, germ cells and pluripotent cells. Loss of function of Oct4 and Nanog results in loss of cellular pluripotency and differentiation [2, 20, 22]. Oct4 is involved in preventing trophectoderm formation by regulating *Cdx2* and *Hand-1* expression and somatic cell differentiation by inhibiting *GATA-4* and *GATA-6* [23]. By contrast, recent data have shown that *Nanog*-/- ES cells retain expression of pluripotency markers, extensive self-renewal capacity and multilineage differentiation in chimeras (except mature germ cells), suggesting that Nanog might function mainly in inner cell mass (ICM) development and germ cell formation [24]. Therefore, Nanog might have a secondary role in self-renewal by enhancing nuclear reprogramming in pluripotent cells rather than a primary role in regulating the transcriptional housekeeping machinery of pluripotent cells [24].

By contrast, Sox2 expression is not restricted to pluripotent or germ cells; Sox2 can heterodimerize with Oct4 [25] and upregulate the expression of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog [26–28], which might endow Sox2 with the ability to regulate the self-renewal of pluripotent cells. Oct4 and Sox2 are sufficient to reprogram human fibroblasts to the pluripotent state [29] and along with one or two transcription factors (e.g. c-Myc and/or Klf4) to reprogram mouse somatic cells to the pluripotent state [4, 30, 31]. Taken together, these results indicate that Oct4 and Sox2 play

an important regulatory part in establishing the pluripotent state from the differentiated state. Interestingly, these core transcription factors regulate their own transcription levels (i.e. autoregulation) by binding together at their own promoters [32], which might be essential for stabilizing the pluripotent state of ES cells [1].

A recent report has elucidated the role of Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in regulating the epigenetic network supporting ES cell pluripotency [33–36]. Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog have been found to co-occupy the regulatory regions of several pluripotency-related transcription factors [32]. These core transcription factors not only activate but also repress the expression of genes, as evidenced by the transcriptional inactivity of nearly half of their target genes in ES cells [9, 32]. Moreover, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog can also indirectly regulate gene transcription by affecting chromatin structure, DNA methylation, microRNA (miRNA) and X chromosome inactivation. Although the role of Krüppel-like factor 4 (Klf4) in pluripotency has not been well defined, the factor is likely to be involved in core transcription circuitry [37]. Recent evidence has shown that Klf4, in cooperation with other Klf family members and Nanog, has a role in regulating *Nanog* expression [37]. Klf4 has also been proposed to serve as an upstream regulator of core transcription circuitry and *c-Myc* expression [38].

Recent evidence points to a new pathway in the regulation of cellular pluripotency. The zinc-finger DNA-binding protein Ronin can support the self-renewal of ES cells and prevent their differentiation in the absence of LIF [39]. Ronin expression is restricted to oocytes and preimplantation embryos, except for some cells in the brain. Ronin is also required for the derivation and self-renewal of ES cells. It is noteworthy that Ronin acts independently of the LIF–Stat3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) pathway, Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog in the self-renewal and maintenance of the undifferentiated state of ES cells. Ronin expression is not significantly affected by knockdown of *Oct4*, *Sox2* and *Nanog*. Ronin binds to the Oct4 promoter region upon ES cell differentiation, and its overexpression inhibits ES cell differentiation upon LIF withdrawal. The protein has been suggested to act as a transcriptional repressor through chromatin regulation and histone modification because it contains a zinc-finger DNA-binding motif THAP (therefore, Ronin is also called THAP domain containing 11 [Thap11]) and binds to HCF-1 (host cell factor-1), a key histone modification-related transcriptional regulator [40, 41]. Genome-wide demethylation of histone Lys9 (H3K9me2) has been observed in Ronin-overexpressing ES cells. Finally, Ronin binds to the promoters of *GATA-4* and *GATA-6* and is accompanied by H3K9me2 enrichment, which is lost upon ES cell differentiation. Taken together, the data suggest that Ronin functions as an anti-differentiation factor through the epigenetic silencing of target gene expression.

Several signaling pathways activated by cell-surface receptors are involved in maintaining the pluripotency of mouse ES cells [2]. Janus kinase (JAK)–STAT3, Wnt, BMP–Smad (similar to mothers against decapentaplegic) and TGF-β–Activin pathways contribute to maintaining ES cell pluripotency by activating a variety of other

downstream pathways—self-renewal, differentiation and apoptosis [42]. BMP 4, for example, suppresses the differentiation of ES cells into ectodermal lineages by triggering Smad1 phosphorylation and Id (inhibitor of differentiation/DNA binding) activation [43]. Recently, there has been evidence that Smad1 and STAT3, in conjunction with Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, co-occupy many binding sites, suggesting that the BMP-Smad and JAK-STAT3 pathways are involved in core transcription-factor circuitry [44].

### Pluripotency controlled by DNA chromatin modification and DNA methylation

The chromatin structure of pluripotent ES cells is transcriptionally more permissive and enriched in active histone marks than that found in differentiated cells [45]. Polycomb group (PcG) proteins indirectly act as transcriptional repressors of developmental genes by catalyzing histone H3 Lys 27 (H3K27) methylation, resulting in the heterochromatic state of their promoter regions, a mark for gene silencing [23,46,47]. Although the mechanism underlying the role of PcG protein in regulating pluripotency remains unclear, the core pluripotent factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog co-occupy the regulatory regions of certain genes in pluripotent cells and are postulated to recruit PcG proteins, ultimately leading to gene repression [46].

Chromatin remodeling factors, such as SWI-SNF (switch-sucrose non-fermentable) and NuRD (nucleosome remodeling and deacetylase) complexes, are also important pluripotency regulators. It has been suggested that nucleosome remodeling SWI-SNF complexes, which facilitate transcription [48], interact with Oct4 and Nanog [49]. Chromatin remodeling and histone deacetylation complex NuRD also interact with Oct4 and Nanog [50].

Histone demethylases of the JmjC family (JHDM) encoded by *Jmjd1a* and *Jmjd2c* genes regulate gene expression by controlling H3K9 and H3K27 methylation [32]. *Jmjd1a* and *Jmjd2c* genes have been found to be upregulated by Oct4 binding to their regulatory regions, which then activate Tcf1 and Nanog [32]. The paramount function of core transcription factors in maintaining cellular pluripotency might consist of regulating the chromatin state by interacting with chromatin-remodeling factors [51]. c-Myc, a factor contributing to, but not essential for, the generation of iPS cells, is postulated to be involved in the regulation of chromatin structure [52] and the promotion of ES self-renewal [53].

DNA methylation is a key epigenetic mark that regulates gene expression. ES cell differentiation is associated with the DNA-methylation status of pluripotency-related and tissue-specific genes [54]. Undifferentiated ES cells express high levels of *de novo* DNA methyltransferase (*Dnmt*)3a and *Dnmt*3b, which might repress differentiation-related genes and, thus, keep ES cells in an undifferentiated state [55,56]. However, *Dnmt1*, *Dnmt3a* and *Dnmt3b* triple-knockout ES cells, which exhibit global hypomethylation, can maintain self-renewal and an undifferentiated ES cell state [57], but they are defective in ES cell differentiation [58]. This demonstrates that Dnmts and DNA methylation is not essential for self-renewal of ES

cells but, rather, for the ability of pluripotent cells to differentiate into specialized cells of various tissues. *Dnmt3a* and *Dnmt3b* are directly regulated by the core pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog, along with transcription factor 3 (Tcf3), but they are also indirectly regulated by the miR-290 cluster that represses retinoblastoma-like 2 (*Rbl2*) [10,34], which is responsible for the downregulation of *Dnmt3a* and *Dnmt3b* [6]. DNA methylation is also involved in chromatin structure regulation, as evidenced by the association between the DNA methylation status and H3K4 methylation levels [59].

#### miRNAs and pluripotency

miRNAs are short single-stranded RNAs (18–25 nucleotides), which do not code for protein but regulate gene expression by interacting with target messenger (m)RNA to result in mRNA degradation, deadenylation or translational repression [60–62]. According to the miRNA database, almost 800 miRNA genes have been identified in the mouse to date (<http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/cgi-bin/targets/v5/genome.pl>). During development, miRNAs are expressed in a tissue-specific manner, suggesting that they are involved in the regulation of cell fate and tissue identity [63]. Although the mechanisms by which miRNAs affect ES self-renewal and pluripotency are not well understood, recent studies have shown that miRNAs have essential roles in regulating ES cell self-renewal and differentiation [6–10]. A delayed cell cycle has been observed in miRNA-deficient ES cells, confirming the involvement of miRNAs in ES cell self-renewal [63]. In addition, miRNA-deficient ES cells can retain the capacity to form ES cell colonies and the expression of pluripotency markers after induction of differentiation, suggesting that miRNAs are involved in the differentiation potential of ES cells [63].

Several miRNA clusters (miR-290 cluster: miR-290 to miR-295) encompassing the 2.2 kb region of chromosome 7 are specific to ES cells [64]. Of these clusters, miR-294, miR-295 and miR-292–3p are the most abundant in undifferentiated ES cells (average: 7600 copies/cell) but are significantly reduced after ES cell differentiation [65]. By contrast, miR-296, miR-470 and miR-134 are upregulated upon differentiation of mouse ES cells and found to target the coding sequence of mRNA of *Nanog*, *Oct4* and *Sox2* [66]. Therefore, miRNAs seem to have an important role in ES cell pluripotency and differentiation. The miR-290 cluster has been postulated to fine-tune ES cell maintenance and differentiation by regulating *de novo* DNA methylation via Rbl2, which inhibits *Dnmt3a* and *Dnmt3b* expression [6,10]. Of note, miRNA genes are bound by the core pluripotency markers Oct4, Sox2, Nanog and Tcf3, suggesting that pluripotency-related transcription factors are likely to regulate the expression of these miRNAs in ES cells [34]. This phenomenon is also found in human ES cells; OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG are associated with at least two miRNA genes, miR-137 and miR-301, in human ES cells [9,46]. Because only a few examples of ES-cell-specific miRNAs and increased expression of miRNA upon differentiation have been found, it has been suggested that miRNAs might function by inhibiting tissue-specific gene expression rather than by supporting expression of pluripotency-related genes in ES cells [65,67]. For example,

miR-1 and miR-133 direct mesoderm formation and regulate differentiation into cardiac muscle by suppressing differentiation into other cell lineages [68].

### Implication of pluripotency for active X chromosome (Xa)

A phenotypic characteristic of pluripotent cells is the lack of an inactive X chromosome (Xi), regardless of X chromosome number. Therefore, female ES cells contain two active X chromosomes (XaXa), whereas tetraploid fusion hybrid cells contain 3 (XaXaXaY) or 4 Xas (XaXaXaXa) [69]. However, the Xa of pluripotent cells is different from the Xa of somatic cells because ES cells express low levels of *Xist* (100- to 1000-fold lower than female somatic cells) [69], which is detected as a pinpoint signal by *Xist* RNA fluorescent in situ hybridization. Recent evidence sheds light on the close correlation between *Xist* expression and cellular pluripotency. Pluripotency-related transcription factors regulate *Xist* expression [35]. The three core pluripotency transcription factors Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog bind to the *Xist* intron 1 in undifferentiated ES cells, which might repress *Xist* expression. Repression of Oct4 expression subsequent to Sox2 and Nanog downregulation triggers the rapid upregulation of *Xist* expression, resulting in the inactivation of an Xa. Therefore, reactivation of an Xi provides evidence for the re-establishment of pluripotent cells from differentiated somatic cells [69–71]. It is interesting to note that the reprogramming of *Xist* and the reactivation of the Xi are much slower processes than the re-establishment of the core pluripotency markers (Oct4, Sox2 and Nanog) and *Tsix*, suggesting that complete reprogramming of *Xist* might occur subsequent to the establishment of the pluripotency network [69].

Pluripotent cells transfer pluripotency to the somatic cells by cell fusion

Pluripotent cells, ES, EG, EC and iPS cells, can transfer their pluripotent property to the somatic cell genome by cell fusion [69,70]. Notwithstanding that the mechanism remains to be elucidated, it is known that pluripotent cell nuclear factors can reset the somatic cell genome to the pluripotent state [72], which is evidenced by activation of pluripotency markers, inactivation of tissue-specific markers and resetting of epigenetic modifications [73].

![Figure 2](attachment:Figure_2.png)

**Figure 2. Mechanism of cellular pluripotency and genomic reprogramming.** The pluripotent state is maintained by a variety of factors and pathways in a coordinated and highly complex manner. The system, which can be thought of as lying dormant in somatic cells, is gradually awakened by the transduced transcription factors during the process of reprogramming. See main text for a detailed description. The abbreviations are as follows: JHDM, histone demethylases of the JmjC family; K, Klf4; M, c-Myc; miRNA, microRNA; N, Nanog; O, Oct4; PcG, polycomb group; S, Sox2; TFs, transcription factors; *Xist*, X inactivation specific transcript. '?' denotes that there is no clear evidence of whether pluripotency induces the activation of the inactive X chromosome or whether the active X chromosome induces pluripotency.

Review

Moreover, overexpression of pluripotency genes, such as Nanog [74] and Sall4 [75], and knockdown of a histone methyltransferase (HMTase) [76] enhances the ability of ES cells to transfer their pluripotent phenotype to somatic cells after cell fusion.

### Concluding remarks and perspectives

Although the mechanism by which somatic cells regain a pluripotent phenotype remains largely unknown, we herein propose a model for the cellular mechanism of reprogramming during the induction of iPS cells, which is defined by the introduction of four transcription factors and exhibits the transcriptional regulatory system and the epigenetics of ES cells (Figure 2).

- Exogenous factors are directly involved in inducing the expression of their endogenous counterparts, which normally takes ~7–15 days post-transduction [77,78]. Therefore, it is likely that the first event in pluripotential reprogramming is the induction of cellular proliferation mediated by high levels of exogenous factors [79], which might facilitate the gradual remodeling of chromatin structure and thereby result in DNA-methylation changes by passively acting pathways. As described earlier, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are involved either directly or indirectly in regulating the chromatin state by interacting with chromatin remodeling factors [51]. This might be followed by step-wise upregulation of endogenous core transcription factors and pluripotency-related downstream genes, with repression of tissue-specific genes by transcriptional repression complexes interacting with Oct4 and Nanog [50]. This should result in the enhancement of all the events (or pathways) needed for pluripotency, such as transcription regulatory circuitry, chromatin remodeling, repression of pluripotency-inhibiting genes and miRNA pathways. Finally, overexpressed exogenous factors become silenced by upregulated Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b [1], and endogenous factors, maintained at critical levels by an autoregulatory system, act to stabilize the pluripotent state [32]. In this reprogramming system, small molecules have been used to facilitate reprogramming of somatic cells [13,80]. Small molecules that enhance reprogramming mostly function in epigenetic modification. For example, inhibition of G9a-mediated H3K9me2 by small molecule BIX01294 might function to facilitate activation of Oct4 by shifting the epigenetic state and substitute for exogenous expression of Oct4. Not only the epigenetic modifier but also the signal transducer has a role in the reprogramming of somatic cells [13]. Bayk, an L-calcium-channel agonist, together with BIX01294 are sufficient to reprogram mouse embryonic fibroblasts into the pluripotent state with only two factors, Oct4 and Klf4, indicating that a small molecule can substitute for Sox2 transduction. The generation of iPS cells using plasmid transfection of four transcription factors still has the possibility of exogenous gene integration [78]. So, the attractive approach to reprogram somatic cells is to induce pluripotency from somatic cells using only small molecules without any genetic transduction.

A series of recent breakthroughs in pluripotential reprogramming heralds a new era in stem-cell biology research [31,78]. A thorough understanding of the mechanism underlying pluripotency and reprogramming is a prerequisite for a widespread applicability of iPS cells in tissue-replacement therapy and other therapeutic considerations. The dual functions (activation and repression) of the core transcription factors suggest that the process of reprogramming somatic cells to a pluripotent state is governed by just a few central factors; others act as accessory factors that improve the efficiency.
