## Purpose of review
The assembly of intestinal lipoproteins is critical for the transport of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. In this review we propose a nomenclature for these lipoproteins and have summarized recent data about their intracellular assembly and factors that modulate their secretion.

## Recent findings
The assembly and secretion of intestinal lipoproteins increases with the augmented synthesis of apoB, apoAIV and lipids. Chylomicron assembly begins with the formation of primordial, phospholipid-rich particles in the membrane, and their conversion to large chylomicrons occurs in the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. Chylomicrons are transported from the endoplasmic reticulum via specialized vesicles to the Golgi for secretion. The identification of genetic mutations in chylomicron retention disease indicates that Sar1b may play a critical role in this process. In addition to chylomicron assembly, intestinal cells have been shown to transport dietary cholesterol via apoB-independent pathways, such as efflux.

## Summary
Understanding the mechanisms involved in the intracellular transport of chylomicrons and chylomicron-independent secretion pathways are expected to be the next frontiers in the field of intestinal lipoprotein assembly and secretion.

## Introduction
Intestinal lipoprotein assembly is essential for the absorption of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins. Absorption is defined as the transport of dietary fat and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestinal lumen to the plasma and consists of three major steps. First, dietary fat is emulsified and hydrolysed in the lumen of the intestine. Second, hydrolysed products are taken up by enterocytes. Third, fat is re-synthesized in enterocytes and packaged into lipoproteins and secreted. This review mainly concentrates on the modulation and assembly of intestinal lipoproteins.

## Proposed nomenclature for intestinal lipoproteins
Lipoproteins secreted by the intestinal cells are very heterogeneous and differ significantly in their buoyancy. Some of these lipoproteins have buoyant densities similar to those observed for hepatic lipoproteins, and the use of VLDL and HDL for both hepatic and intestinal lipoproteins has become confusing. We propose that apoB-containing intestinal lipoproteins be referred to as chylomicrons, CM, and different subclasses as subscripts. For example, large chylomicrons ($S_{f} > 400$) and small chylomicron ($S_{f} 20–400$) can be referred to as $CM_{L}$ and $CM_{S}$, respectively. The intestinal lipoproteins with flotation density corresponding to plasma VLDL and LDL can be designated $CM_{VLDL}$ and $CM_{LDL}$, respectively. For particles that do not have apoB, we propose ‘I-HDL’ to identify intestinal high density lipoproteins. Depending on their size and flotation properties they can be subdivided into $I-HDL_{1}$, $I-HDL_{2}$, etc.

## Modulation of intestinal lipoprotein secretion
Three different mechanisms have been shown to modulate the secretion of intestinal lipoproteins. First, the regulation of apoB transcription has been shown to affect intestinal lipoprotein production. It is generally believed that $apob$ gene transcription is constitutive, and that apoB levels change primarily by co- and post-translational mechanisms. Singh *et al.* [1] showed that a modest change in the transcription of the endogenous apoB gene in cells affects its secretion. They showed that transforming growth factor beta (TGF-$\beta$) increases apoB secretion in differentiated and non-differentiated Caco-2 cells and decreases apoB secretion in HepG2 cells without affecting apoAI secretion. TGF-$\beta$ altered apoB secretion by changing steady state messenger RNA levels and protein synthesis. The effect of TGF-$\beta$ was shown to be

mediated through the binding of SMADs in a 485 base pair (bp) intestine-specific enhancer element, 55 kb upstream of the *apob* gene. In contrast to TGF-β, TNF-α and IL-1β decrease apoB secretion via the epidermal growth factor receptor signaling pathway [2]. It is unknown whether this modulation involves gene transcription. Nonetheless, TGF-β studies suggest that the transcriptional regulation of the *apob* gene plays a role in controlling intestinal lipoprotein assembly and secretion, and tweaking of the transcriptional controls may be of therapeutic value in altering apoB levels.

Second, recent studies have shown that apoAIV levels affect intestinal lipoprotein assembly. Lu *et al.* [3] have demonstrated that a high-fat diet induces apoAIV expression by sevenfold in newborn swine jejunum. Similarly, a threefold increase in apoAIV mRNA levels were observed in Caco-2 cells supplemented apically with lipid micelles [4•]. An approximately 1.3 kb intragenic regulatory region between the apoCIII and apoAIV genes was sufficient for the induction of a reporter gene by apical lipid supply in stably transfected cells. This induction was attenuated by the expression of a dominant negative hepatic nuclear factor 4 suggesting that the induction of apoAIV involves this transcription factor [4•]. More interestingly, an approximately 50-fold enhanced expression of apoAIV in a newborn swine enterocyte cell line, IPEC-1, has been shown to increase the secretion of nascent triglycerides and phospholipids with chylomicrons by two to threefold [3]. It thus appears that fat feeding induces apoAIV synthesis, and apoAIV in turn facilitates lipid secretion. The molecular mechanisms involved in this process are not fully understood, but Weinberg *et al.* [5] have suggested that apoAIV may help in the expansion of nascent chylomicrons into CM<sub>L</sub> by maintaining interfacial tension and the elasticity of these larger particles.

Third, in diabetes and insulin resistance, enhanced lipid synthesis has been shown to augment intestinal lipoprotein secretion. Elevated plasma triglyceride and cholesterol levels observed in diabetes and insulin resistance have largely been attributed to the overproduction of hepatic VLDL. Newer studies have indicated that intestinal lipoproteins also contribute to hypertriglyceridemia and hypercholesterolemia in various animal models of diabetes. Syrian golden hamsters develop marked hypertriglyceridemia and insulin resistance after feeding a 60% fructose diet for 2 weeks [6]. Enterocytes from these animals synthesized and secreted more lipids, apoB48, and CM<sub>L</sub> [7]. A high fructose diet enhanced microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) levels by twofold in the liver [6], but changes in the intestinal MTP levels were modest [7,8]. In chow-fed sand rats, lipid synthesis was augmented and intracellular degradation of apoB48 was reduced in the intestine in the absence of any changes in MTP activity [9]. The increased lymphatic

transport of triglycerides also occurs in genetically obese Otsuka Long-Evans Tokushima Fatty rats despite a significant reduction in intestinal MTP activity [10]. Increases in intestinal MTP mRNA levels have been reported in Zucker obese [11] and streptozotocin diabetic rats [12], but no information about its activity was reported. Robust lipoprotein production in insulin resistance thus appears to be secondary to diminished apoB degradation following ample lipid availability. In the liver, enhanced lipoprotein production is also accompanied with increased MTP levels. However, in the intestine, MTP activity may or may not be affected during insulin resistance.

### Intracellular intestinal lipoprotein assembly

Chylomicron assembly was proposed to involve the synthesis of ‘primordial lipoproteins’ followed by their core expansion, resulting in the formation of ‘nascent lipoproteins’ [13]. This basic proposal was expanded to suggest that chylomicron assembly may involve three independent steps: the assembly of primordial lipoproteins, the formation of lipid droplets, and core expansion [14]. Subsequently, different biochemical signposts for various biosynthetic milestones were articulated [15]. The association of preformed phospholipids with nascent apoB was proposed to identify the assembly of primordial lipoproteins. Increased amounts of nascent triglycerides would signify the synthesis of larger lipoproteins. In addition, retinol ester was proposed to mark the completion of chylomicron assembly.

To identify the intracellular site of chylomicron assembly, Cartwright *et al.* [16] and Cartwright and Higgins [17] separated rough endoplasmic reticulum, smooth endoplasmic reticulum, and Golgi fractions using the iodixanol gradient and studied the distributions of apoB48 and various lipids in the membrane and lumenal fractions of these compartments. Triglycerides and cholesterol were mainly associated with trans-Golgi fractions, whereas phospholipids and apoB48 were in the membrane fractions of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, indicating that the primordial particle assembly probably begins in these membranes [17]. The short-term pulse revealed the presence of dense, phospholipid-rich, apoB48 particles in the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. During chase, these particles were converted to larger lipoproteins and transported to the Golgi and secreted into the media. Such studies thus suggest that chylomicrons are synthesized as phospholipid-rich dense particles (CM<sub>HDL</sub>) on the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membrane, become lumenal and get converted to larger lipoproteins (CM<sub>L</sub>) (Fig. 1).

Kumar and Mansbach [18] have studied the transport of chylomicrons using cell-free systems. They isolated microsomes from rat enterocytes, and showed that the

The synthesis of apoB48 occurs in the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the assembly of primordial intestinal lipoproteins mainly occurs in the membranes of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (SER) forming a phospholipid-rich primordial particle. These primordial particles ($CM_{HDL}$) become luminal and get converted into larger lipoproteins ($CM_L$) in the lumen of the SER and are transported to the Golgi via transport vesicles. Sar1b has been suggested to be critical for this vesicular transport based on the identification of mutations in chylomicron retention disease. Recent studies have also indicated that there may be apoB-independent pathways in the transport of lipids across the intestinal epithelial cells. In this pathway, apoAl secreted by enterocytes can act as an acceptor for cholesterol efflux from adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette protein A1. DGAT, diacylglycerol acyltransferase.

transport of nascent triglycerides and apoB48 from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi was a vesicular process that occurs at $37^\circ$C and requires adenosine triphosphate and cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, the authors purified putative pre-chylomicron transport vesicles that contained apoB48 and triglycerides and showed that these vesicles could deliver their contents to the Golgi [19]. The isolated vesicles contained sec13, sec31, and sar1, indicating that they may be COPII vesicles known to traffic cargo from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi [20*].

Chylomicron retention disease is characterized by the absence of apoB48, low plasma cholesterol levels, and lack of postprandial response. Jones et al. [21**] have identified several mutations in the SARA2 gene in this disorder. The Sar1b protein, the translational product of the SARA2 gene, is a single polypeptide of 198 amino acids. A crystal structure of the hamster Sar1 polypeptide consists of six $\alpha$-helices and six $\beta$-sheets [22]. The $\beta$-sheets form a guanine diphosphate binding pocket,

and all missense mutations in chylomicron retention disease were found in this region. Structural and site-directed mutagenesis experiments suggest that Sar1 contains an N-terminal hydrophobic patch that interacts with a transmembrane nucleotide exchange protein, Sec12, and this interaction may recruit Sar1 to the membrane [22]. Sec12 exchanges guanine diphosphate present in the Sar1 with guanosine triphosphate. The Sar1-guanosine triphosphate binds to Sec23 and brings the Sec23/24 complex to the membrane forming a pre-budding complex [22,23]. The complex then recruits Sec13/31, which polymerizes and causes membrane deformation and budding. Such studies suggest that chylomicron retention disease may arise as a result of defects in the transport of chylomicron through the secretory pathway.

Morel et al. [24*] have studied chylomicron assembly and secretion in differentiated Caco-2 cells using fluorescence and electron microscopy. They showed that apoB is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and

transported through the Golgi to the apical microvilli. These conclusions were based on culturing cells at 19°C and co-localization with β-COP, a trans-Golgi marker. No markers for smooth endoplasmic reticulum were studied. Next, they showed that the apical supplementation of lipid micelles resulted in the transport of apoB from the apical compartment to the basolateral side and the appearance of lipid droplets in the subapical compartment. Such studies portray a complex picture of chylomicron assembly. The concept that primordial lipoproteins are formed in the endoplasmic reticulum and targeted to the apical surface from the trans-Golgi is novel and different from the conclusions obtained from several other studies discussed above. Certainly, more studies are required to understand chylomicron assembly and secretion in these cells. Careful studies are also required to understand the origin and properties of the apical compartment.

### Multiple cholesterol transport pathways

It is generally believed that dietary cholesterol enters the body as a part of chylomicrons. Iqbal *et al.* [25**] showed that the transport of cholesterol in differentiated Caco-2 cells and rat primary enterocytes involves multiple mechanisms broadly classified into apoB-dependent and apoB-independent pathways. The secretion of cholesterol with chylomicrons was induced by oleic acid supplementation and repressed by MTP inhibition. Both the pathways transported free cholesterol, but cholesterol esters were secreted exclusively via the apoB-dependent pathway. ApoB-independent cholesterol transport was inhibited by glyburide and enhanced by liver X receptor/retinoid X receptor agonists, suggesting the involvement of adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette protein A1 (ABCA1). Newer studies have indicated that apoAI may also play a part in this process [26]. Cholesterol secretion by apoB-independent, but not apoB-dependent, pathways was significantly reduced in primary enterocytes isolated from apoAI⁻/⁻ mice (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, short-term studies revealed that cholesterol absorption was significantly reduced in these mice [26]. Cholesterol transport with apoB lipoproteins was not affected in apoAI⁻/⁻ mice, but its transport with HDL was significantly curtailed (Fig. 2b). We also observed that a bolus of cholesterol was efficiently absorbed within 48 h in knockout mice [26]. These data have been interpreted to suggest that apoAI deficiency results in delayed cholesterol absorption because of a reduction in its transport via the HDL pathway. However, over a long period, apoB-dependent pathways compensate for this deficiency and complete the absorption process. The intestine may thus have more than one mechanism for the transport of lipids, and these complementary mechanisms may act in concert for efficient lipid absorption. Evidence for compensatory mechanisms also comes from cholesterol absorption studies in chow-fed acyl-coenzyme A: cholesterol

Primary enterocytes were isolated from control and apoAI⁻/⁻ mice and pulsed for 1 h with [³H] cholesterol, washed and chased in the presence of 1.2 mM oleic acid.

acyltransferase 2 (ACAT2)⁻/⁻ mice [27*, 28*]. These mice absorb cholesterol as efficiently as wild-type mice despite the absence of cholesterol esterification, probably as a result of the transport of free cholesterol via the efflux pathway. Fourfold increased levels of ABCA1 mRNA levels have been detected in ACAT2⁻/⁻ mice [28*]. Temel *et al.* [29] have also shown that genetic ablation of either ACAT2 or ABCA1 in mice results in a 23% or 48% reduction in cholesterol absorption, respectively. However, the combined deficiency of these proteins resulted in a 79% reduction in cholesterol absorption, suggesting that the transport of cholesterol esters and free cholesterol occurs by different mechanisms, and these mechanisms in concert contribute to efficient cholesterol absorption. An understanding of the apoB-independent

pathways may result in the identification of better targets for controlling plasma cholesterol levels, because the inhibition of apoB-dependent pathways via MTP antagonists has not yet been successful.

# Conclusion

Intestinal lipoprotein assembly plays an essential role in proper growth and development. The assembly begins at the smooth endoplasmic reticulum membranes by the formation of primordial particles enriched in phospholipids. The conversion of primordial particles to larger lipoproteins occurs in the lumen of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum. These particles are subsequently transported to Golgi via specialized transported vesicles where final maturation steps may take place. The mechanisms involved in the vesicular transport of intestinal lipoproteins have not yet been fully elucidated. Certainly, the role of Sar1b in intracellular transport of chylomicrons needs to be determined. Another area that needs further exploration is the exciting possibility that intestinal cells may have more than one mechanism for the transport of fat and fat-soluble vitamins. The identification of proteins and subcellular transport mechanisms will provide new information about different ways in which the intestine transports fat and fat-soluble vitamins.
