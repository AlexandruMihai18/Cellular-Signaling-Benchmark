### 1 Introduction

China plays a major role in antibiotics production. Antibiotics of industrial, agricultural and medicinal significance like erythromycin, avermectin and validamycin are produced in vast amounts every year. Great efforts are constantly being made for the screening of natural compounds and for strain improvement by traditional means, but a rapid growth in research on diverse antibiotic biosynthetic pathways and metabolic engineering for new drug discovery has only started to emerge over the last decade or so. This research obviously resulted from intensive studies on the identification and characterization of a series of gene clusters of diverse antibiotic groups and various biological activities, followed by the elucidation of their biosynthetic pathways and extensive effort for the generation of novel antibiotic derivatives by modern biotechnology related to metabolic engineering and combinatorial biosynthesis. The subjects of studies at this level mostly made the privileged use of genetic resources originating from China, although chemical diversities and useful biological activities were also of initial research interest. The categories of antibiotics subjected to studies included a variety of related or unrelated compounds and producers in different laboratories. We will thus review the overall major progress made over the last ten years or so.

### 2 Development of efficient host-vector systems for the genetic manipulation of antibiotic producers of interest

There is a broad range of antibiotic producers. Most belong to the *Streptomyces* class and the closely-related actinomycetes. Genetic systems to manipulate them are usually non-universal, but quite often strain-specific. In the early stages of development, from the beginning of the last century up to the 1990's in China, most efforts were application orientated, and thus concentrated on a strain improvement program aiming for higher producers for traditional antibiotics using classic techniques, such as mutagenesis by NTG (nitrosoguanidine) or ultraviolet light, and later popularly by protoplast fusions. Little intensive research on the more fundamental aspects such as the development of efficient host-vector systems for the genetic manipulation of strains of interest, which is one of the most key elements, quite often prerequisite, in the research programs in order to improve antibiotic productivity and to create novel antibiotics by genetic methods in native producers,

has been conducted, or even funded, making China far behind the international frontiers in this particular field. Thanks to the national opening up policy and steady economic development, resulting in extensive international collaborations and more intensive national funding, basic research has started to focus on important and even model producers over the last decade. Thus, we would first like to give a brief introduction to some examples of work involving genetic studies for the establishment of efficient host-vector systems for the genetic manipulation of antibiotic producers of interest. This work has contributed significantly to a steady progress on the later cloning, characterization and functional analysis of several antibiotic biosynthetic pathways, and the use of gene information for pathway engineering.

### 2.1 Circular plasmid vectors derived from *Streptomyces* and *Micromonospora* plasmids

pIJ101 is a multi-copy-number *Streptomyces* plasmid that replicates by a rolling circle mechanism.² The locus of *sti* contains the pIJ101 origin of second-strand synthesis.² Most pIJ101-derived cloning vectors lack *sti* and, therefore, accumulate the single-stranded replication intermediate. Finding that *sti+* plasmids can be used to transform several antibiotic-producing *Streptomyces* strains that gave no transformants with *sti-*plasmids leads to the construction of the two *sti+* plasmid vectors which are excellent for making gene replacements in *Streptomyces* because the plasmids are rapidly lost in the absence of antibiotic selection: pHZ1351 (Fig. 1) has a polylinker cloning site and it can be propagated both in *Streptomyces* and in *E. coli.*³ pHZ1358 (Fig. 1) has additionally the origin of transfer of the conjugative plasmid RP4 for efficient conjugative transfer from *E. coli* to *Streptomyces*, and a phage *cos* site flanked by T3 and T7 promoters for the efficient generation of ordered cosmid libraries.³⁴

A bifunctional cosmid cloning vector, pHZ132 (Fig. 2), for the conjugal transfer of large-sized DNA fragments from *E. coli* to *Streptomyces* sp. had also been constructed. pHZ132 is 10.2 kb in size and contains a pSG5 origin of replication. It also carries the oriT derived from the IncP plasmid RP4 for mobilization from *E. coli* to *Streptomyces* by RP4, thiostrepton resistance gene (*tsr*) and viomycin resistance gene (*vph*) for selection in *Streptomyces*, and ampicillin resistance gene (*bla*) for selection in *E. coli.*⁵ pHZ132 derivatives with up to 40 kb inserts can be mobilized efficiently by RP4 or its derivative pRK2073 from *E. coli* to *Streptomyces* sp.⁶ Plasmid mobilization can be done either by two parental mating (*E. coli* donor carries both pHZ132 derivative and an integrated RP4) or by tri-parental mating (pHZ132 derivative and RP4 derivative, pRK2073, were carried by two independent *E. coli* strains).⁷ pHZ132 has been used successfully for the construction of a genomic library of several *Streptomyces* and pHZ132 and its derivatives can routinely be mobilized into these strains for the convenience of functional analysis.⁸⁻¹²

pIJ6021 and pIJ4123 are high-copy-number vectors for gene expression in *Streptomyces*.¹³ They contain a strong, thiostrepton-inducible promoter, PtipA. Two *E. coli-Streptomyces* shuttle vectors, pHZ1271 and pHZ1272 (Fig. 3), were constructed by inserting a replicon and *bla* gene from an *E. coli* plasmid into

Vector systems allowing autonomous or site-specific integrative gene cloning were also developed for *Micromonospora* sp. 40027, a producer of the antibiotic fortimycin A.¹⁸ The autonomous system depends on the discovery of a low-copy-number, self-transmissible CCC plasmid, pJTU112 (ca. 14.1 kb), which was shown to be present in the progenitor strain in both integrated and autonomous states. The copy numbers of both pJ TU112 and its three derivatives can be amplified at least six-fold by the addition of streptomycin to the culture medium. The integrative system was developed by the use of a pBR322-derived *E. coli* plasmid vector, pSET152, mediated by the attP site of the *Streptomyces* phage ΦC31.¹⁹ Both vectors can be transferred by conjugation from *E. coli* into *Micromonospora* sp. 40027. The heterologous cloning and expression of the *dnd* gene cluster originating from *S. lividans* 1326 into *Micromonospora* sp. 40027 demonstrated the use of the two systems.¹⁹–²¹

### 2.2 Discovery of a linear, temperature-sensitive plasmid for replication in *Streptomyces hygroscopicus* 10–22

*S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 was shown to harbour a conjugative, autonomously replicating linear plasmid pHZ6 of ca. 70 kb, which shows no obvious homology with chromosomal DNA, is temperature-sensitive for replication, being stable in the host at 28 °C but easily lost at 37 °C.²²,²³ On a lawn of the wild-type *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 cured of pHZ6, pHZ6 elicits pocks. Temperature-sensitivity seemed to be a unique property for pHZ6 among six linear plasmids tested, including the well-known linear plasmid SLP2 in *S. lividans* 1326 and SCP1 in *Streptomyces coelicolor* A3(2). The distinct identity of pHZ6 from previously identified pHZ1 to pHZ5 was demonstrated by the profile of relevant plasmids in six well-defined strains originated from *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22.²² It is expected that this plasmid could be helpful for the future development of linear plasmid vectors for the transfer and expression of large gene clusters like those involved in antibiotic production in heterologous hosts.

### 2.3 Effort to optimize host amenability by genetic manipulation

*S. hygroscopicus* 5102–6 was discovered in Yingcheng county, Hubei province, China. Strain 5102–6, which produces three antifungal antibiotics, the first of which is used extensively, with the others used on a small scale, in Chinese agriculture.²⁴ Antibiotic 5102-I, an aminocyclitol antibiotic, now known to be identical to validamycin, is highly effective against *Pellicularia sasakii*, which causes rice sheath blight disease, against *P. filamentosa*, which causes seedling blight of cotton, and against *Helminthosporium sigmoideum*, which causes sclerotial disease of rice.²⁴,²⁵ Antibiotic 5102-II is a polypeptide useful for protection against leaf spot of corn.²⁶ Antibiotic 5102-III, whose structure is unknown, is useful for the control of cotton wilt caused by *Fusarium oxysporum*.²⁷ Conventional mutagenesis was used to isolate strain 10–22, with increased production of antibiotic 5102-I. Great effort was made to use molecular biological techniques to study the antibiotic production genes of *S. hygroscopicus*, but unfortunately this strain could not be transformed with any of the commonly used *Streptomyces* plasmid vectors and was resistant to plaque formation by the *Streptomyces* phages ΦC31 and R4.²⁸ Repeated selection resulted in the isolation of derivatives of *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22

pIJ4123 and pIJ6021, respectively.¹⁴ Both vectors were structurally stable either in *E. coli* or in *Streptomyces lividans*. To demonstrate the utility of pHZ1272, the hemoglobin gene of *Vitreoscilla* (*vhb*) and delta-endotoxin *cryIA(c)* gene of *Bacillus thuringiensis* were cloned into pHZ1272 and expressed in *S. lividans*. The expression products, VHb and CryIA(c), were either detected by bioassay or by Western blotting and carbon monoxide binding activity analysis.¹⁴,¹⁵ The successful use of pHZ1272 for protein expression in *S. lividans* has also been reported elsewhere.¹²,¹⁶,¹⁷

that could be transformed with pIJ101 and pJVl-derived cloning vectors and of restriction-deficient derivatives that could accept DNA propagated in *S. lividans* 66. These new strains, which include three that still produce the original antibiotics, can be used as hosts for gene cloning. Insertion of non-replicating vectors by homologous recombination and transposition of Tn4560 were demonstrated in *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22.

Establishment of reliable gene transfer systems allowing efficient genetic manipulation of the polyene-producing *Streptomyces* initially experienced great difficulty in several polyene producers, including *Streptomyces griseus* IMRU 3570 (producing candidin). Only inter-specific conjugation and phage-mediated gene transfer allowed the efficient introduction of recombinant DNA into these strains. The systems for handling *Streptomyces* sp. FR-008 (candicidin producer, see below), however, are robust and amenable, including successful construction of the restriction-deficient mutant host strain DX600 allowing highly efficient introduction of the autonomously replicating cosmid pHZ132, pIJ653, *E. coli* suicide vector pHZ199 and pDH5 by transformation or conjugation, targeted gene knock-outs using unstable low (pKC505 derived from SCP2*) and high-copy-number (pHZ1358 derived from pIJ101) *Streptomyces* plasmid vectors. Added to the advantage of *Streptomyces* sp. FR-008 is its exceptionally fast growth rate and very abundant sporulation, which is quite convenient for the genetic manipulation of antibiotics produced by using this strain.

The initial development of the gene cloning system for *Streptomyces nanchangensis* NS3226 also experienced great difficulty. The regeneration frequency of NS3226 protoplasts was only 0.02%. Typically, about 6% of the colonies were derived from non-protoplasted units that survived dilution in water. Several plasmids failed to give ThioR (thiostrepton resistance) NS3226 protoplast transformants, even with several micrograms of pure plasmid DNA. These included: the sti-pIJ101 derivatives pIJ702 and pIJ486 isolated from *S. lividans* JT46; sti+pIJ101

derivatives pHZ1351 and pHZ1358 isolated from *E. coli* DH5α; SCP2*-derived low-copy-number plasmid vector pIJ922; SLP1.2-derived vector pIJ61; pJV1-derived multi-copy-number plasmid vector pWOR120, the last three isolated from *S. lividans* JT46. Transformation attempts using the denatured DNA of pIJ702 and pHZ1351 also failed. *Streptomyces* phage ΦC31, and its derived attP+vector KC301, and attP-vectors KC505, KC515, KC516, KC518, however, could infect *S. nanchangensis* NS3226 and form lysogens. Another *Streptomyces* phage, ΦHAU3, and its derivatives, pIJ8300 and pIJ8301 could also infect, but not lysogenize, NS3226.

Two systems were developed for functional analysis of the gene clusters by gene disruption or replacement: (1) *Streptomyces* phage ΦC31 and its derived vectors can infect and lysogenize these strains; (2) pSET152, an *E. coli* plasmid with ΦC31attP site, and pHZ1358, a *Streptomyces-E. coli* shuttle cosmid vector, both carrying oriT from RP4, can be mobilized from *E. coli* into these strains by conjugation. pHZ1358 was demonstrated to be generally useful for generating mutant strains by gene disruption or replacement in many *Streptomyces* strains of interest.

### 2.4 Mapping genome for important antibiotic producers

The chromosomal DNA of *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22, a derivative of strain 5102–6 as a producer for three important antifungal antibiotics, was digested with several restriction endonucleases and analyzed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Digestions with Asel gave 11 fragments with a total length of ca. 7.36Mb. The Asel sites were mapped by analysis of overlapping chromosomal deletions in different mutants, and confirmed by southern hybridizations using partially digested genome fragments and linking cosmids as probes. PFGE analysis of DNA with and without proteinase K (PK) treatment, together with the hybridization results, suggested a linear organization with terminal proteins and large terminal inverted repeats. Some deletion mutants had

circular chromosomes.³⁴ Such genomic mapping experiments have greatly aided the localization and identification of the genes involved in antibiotic biosynthesis. For example, an extensive analysis of overlapping chromosomal deletions in different mutants of *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 and correlation of the relative locations of the large chromosomal deletions on the established physical map of *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 deletion mutants with their abilities to produce an aminocyclitol antibiotic 5102-I enabled subsequent localization, identification and final cloning of the aminocyclitol antibiotic jinggangmycin biosynthesis gene cluster.²⁵

### 3 Cloning and characterization of a group of diversified antibiotic biosynthetic gene clusters

A representative group of multiple and diversified antibiotics gene clusters from several independent *Streptomyces* strains were cloned and analyzed. Among the most notable successes were the cloning and characterization of the validamycin, nanchangmycin, candidin, meilingmycin, nikkomycin, chlorothricin and oxzolomycin biosynthetic gene clusters, and proposals of their biosynthetic pathways.

#### 3.1 Aminocyclitol validamycin (val) gene cluster

Validamycin A (1) (Fig. 4) is a weakly basic water-soluble C₇N-aminocyclitol-containing antibiotic, which is widely used, especially in Asia, to control sheath blight disease of rice plants and damping-off of cucumber seedlings caused by the fungus *Pellicularia sasakii* (*Rhizoctonia solani*).³⁵ Upon treatment with validamycin, normal extension of the main hyphae is switched to an abnormal branching at the tips and further development of the growing fungi is severely repressed.³⁶ Validamycin A 1 was also found to have insecticidal activity, most likely resulting from its strong inhibition of trehalase, the trehalose-degrading enzyme.

Trehalose is a primary storage carbohydrate in fungi (8 to 10% of the dry cell weight of *P. sasakii*) and is recognized as a characteristic blood sugar of insects. The enzyme trehalase appears to play an important metabolic role in these organisms in generating glucose for energy supply or for other physiological purposes. Its inhibition results in disruption of the glucose supply system of the fungus leading to growth abnormality and death. It is proposed that the presence of the glucose moiety on validamycin A is essential for its efficient entry into fungal mycelia, in which it is hydrolyzed by an α-glucosidase to yield the active pharmacophore, validoxylamine A (4).³⁷ Validamycin A 1 is also used as the source of valienamine, a pharmaceutically important precursor for the production of the antidiabetic drug, voglibose (Basen®) by bioconversion and chemical modifications, whose mechanism of action is to inhibit α-glucosidase in the intestine, comparable to another antidiabetic agent acarbose.³⁸

Using the *acbC* gene from the acarbose gene cluster as a heterologous probe, a stretch of 45 kb DNA from *S. hygroscopicus* 5008 was cloned, and confirmed to be involved in the biosynthesis for validamycin A 1.³² Using gene knockout and homology information, 8 of the sequenced 27 genes were found to be essential for validamycin biosynthesis, and their introduction as a construct into the heterologous host (*S. lividans*) successfully produced 1 (Fig. 5 and Table 1).³⁹

Three of the 8 essential genes for validamycin biosynthesis were characterized by using genetic and biochemical methods. The direct involvement of *valA*, the counterpart *acbC*-homologue, in validamycin biosynthesis, was confirmed *in vivo* by gene inactivation as well as *in vitro* by biochemical characterization of the reaction catalyzed by the ValA protein heterologously over-expressed in *E. coli*, which was shown to be able to catalyze specifically for the cyclization of D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate (5) to generate 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone (6) (Fig. 6).³²

Similarly, *in vivo* inactivation of the putative glycosyltransferase gene (*valG*) abolished the final attachment of glucose for the production of 1, and resulted in the accumulation of the validamycin precursor, validoxylamine A 4, while the normal production of validamycin could be restored by complementation with *valG*. Consequently, the role of ValG in the glycosylation of 4 to validamycin A 1 was demonstrated *in vitro* by enzymatic assay using UDP-glucose, in exact agreement with the fact that the heterologous expression of the *val* gene cluster, with or without *valG*, yielded validamycin A 1 and validoxylamine A 4, respectively, in *S. lividans* 1326.³⁹

A gene likely encoding an enzyme homologous to the unique C₇-cyclitol kinase (*valC*) was also identified. Inactivation of the gene (*valC*) resulted in mutants that lack the ability to produce

<sup>a</sup> Function confirmed.

validamycin A 1. Complementation experiments with a replicating plasmid harboring full-length valC restored the production of 1, suggesting a critical function of valC in validamycin 1 biosynthesis. In vitro characterization of ValC revealed a new type of C<sub>7</sub>-cyclitol kinase with distinct substrate recognition from that of AcbM, a homologous enzyme in acarbose biosynthesis.<sup>40</sup> The result also justifies the discrepancy of feeding experiment results reported previously and underscore the existence of two different pathways leading to the same end-product, the valienamine moiety of acarbose and validamycin 1 (Minagawa et al., unpublished).

The availability of the genetic information, the results of the previous feeding experiments, as well as the biochemical analysis of several related enzymes, made it possible to propose a comprehensive pathway to validamycin 1 biosynthesis (Fig. 6): the initiation from D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate 5 to form the cyclic product, 2-epi-5-epi-valiolone 6 was confirmed to be catalyzed by ValA. Subsequently, epimerization at C-2 and dehydration at C-5/C-6 of 6 by the proposed bifunctional ValK (which showed significant homology with the sugar epimerase/dehydratase) would give valienone (7), which is proven to be phosphorylated by the kinase, ValC, to give valienone 7-phosphate (8). Valienone 7-phosphate 8 may serve as the branching point to be reduced to validone 7-phosphate (9) on the one hand and to valienol 7-phosphate or 1-epi-valienol 7-phosphate on the other by the reductase ValN and/or other reductases/dehydrogenases. Transamination of the keto group of 9 catalyzed by the aminotransferase ValM would give validamine 7-phosphate. On the other hand, valienol 7-phosphate or its 1-epimer is either phosphorylated at C-1 by an unidentified kinase to generate the 1,7-diphosphate derivative or transformed into valienol 1-phosphate through catalysis by a phosphoglucomutase. The product is subsequently converted to an NDP-valienol derivative (NDP = nucleotide diphospho) by the nucleotidyl transferase ValB. Condensation of validamine 7-phosphate with the NDP-valienol derivative would give phosphorylated validoxylamine A, whose conversion to validoxylamine A 4 requires a dephosphorylation activity. Finally, validoxylamine A

4 is converted to validamycin A 1 through catalysis by the glucosyltransferase ValG using UDP-glucose as the sugar donor. Three oxidoreductase genes present in the cluster, *valE*, *valF* and *valJ*, do not seem to be necessary for the biosynthesis of validamycin A, but could be involved in the biosynthesis of validamycins B (2) and/or G (3), the hydroxylated analogs of validamycin A 1.³⁹

Concurrently, cloning of a gene cluster for jinggangmycin biosynthesis from *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 revealed the immediate identities of the genes common to *S. hygroscopicus* strains 10–22 and 5008, which prompted a comparison of the chemical structures of jinggangmycin and validamycin A 1, leading to a clear demonstration that they are identical. It was interesting to note that the yield of jinggangmycin produced by *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 seemed to be at least 10 times lower than validamycin produced by *S. hygroscopicus* 5008, although the cloned genes involved in jinggangmycin biosynthesis isolated from *S. hygroscopicus* 10–22 seem to be very similar to their counterpart genes isolated from *S. hygroscopicus* 5008.²⁵ Remarkable differences between the two strains were also displayed from a comparison of their PFGE banding patterns and their circular and linear plasmid profiles, suggesting their different origins.²²,²³,³⁴ It is anticipated that analysis of a complete gene cluster involved in the jinggangmycin biosynthesis (*jin*) should now provide an excellent opportunity for comparative investigation into the molecular mechanisms of genetic control and/or possible variation and evolution, if any, in the pathways for validamycin/jinggangmycin biosynthesis, and for the possible exchange of the genes between two producers for yield improvement.

Analysis of the validamycin/jinggangmycin biosynthetic gene cluster, as well as *in vivo* and *in vitro* characterization of a number of enzymes involved in validamycin/jinggangmycin biosynthesis, provided important insights into the biosynthesis of this antibiotic and other related aminocyclitol-containing natural products. Now that the essential gene sequence is available, it may become possible to engineer rice and other vulnerable crops to express validamycin A 1 to protect them against the sheath blight fungus (*Pellicularia sasakii*). The work may also make more efficient the production of several drug precursors, such as valienamine, a validamycin A degradation product that is important in the production of voglibose, the diabetes drug.

### 3.2 Polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (*nan*) gene cluster

Polyether ionophores have found widespread application in veterinary medicine and animal husbandry and more recently have been identified as agents with activity against drug-resistant strains of malaria. They are a group of polyketides that affect cation transport in mitochondria. They often inhibit gram-positive bacteria, including mycobacteria and fungi. They are also used as growth promoters in ruminants. Hundreds of polyethers, such as monensin, salinomycin, nigericin, and nanchangmycin (10) (Fig. 7), have the ability to selectively chelate metal ions and transport them across cell membranes. They adopt a cyclic conformation by concentrating oxygen functions at their center where they complex a suitable cation, e.g., sodium in the case of dianemycin.⁴¹,⁴² The branched alkyl groups on the outer surface make the molecule lipid-soluble so that cations can be conducted across membranes. The bis-spiroacetal ring system, unique for this group of compounds, suggests novel enzymatic steps in

the biosynthetic pathway. Nanchangmycin 10 (also known as dianemycin), produced by *S. nanchangensis*, has been found to inhibit gram-positive bacteria, and can be used as a growth promoter in poultry and to cure coccidiosis in chickens.³ Because of its strong activity and low toxicity, nanchangmycin 10 has become a potential drug for the poultry industry.

A region of 132 kb of the genome of *S. nanchangensis* was found to encode the biosynthesis of the polyether ionophore nanchangmycin (*nan*), as one of the eight independent gene clusters containing varying lengths of type I polyketide synthase (PKS) genes isolated from this single strain, which accounts for nearly one tenth of the entire genome.³ This implies nicely that microorganisms may encode many more secondary metabolites than are readily detectable in standard fermentation, and that type I PKS-like pathways could be a common theme among many different bacteria, apart from the most commonly studied actinomycetes.

The PKS genes for biosynthesis of the polyether nanchangmycin 10 are organized to encode two sets of proteins (six and seven ORFs, respectively), but separated by independent ORFs that encode a putative epimerase, epoxidase and epoxide hydrolase, and notably an independent ACP (acyl carrier protein). One of the PKS modules lacks a corresponding ACP. The process of oxidative cyclization to form the polyether structure was proposed to occur when the polyketide chain was still anchored on the independent ACP before release. 4-*O*-Methyl-L-rhodinose biosynthesis and its transglycosylation involve four putative genes and regulation of the biosynthesis of 10 seems to involve activation as well as repression.³¹

Obviously, however, the polyether nanchangmycin 10 lacks an apparent thioesterase appended to the C-terminus of the last module comparable to the Type I thioesterase domains of the modular PKSs responsible for macrolide biosynthesis. Three candidate polyether chain-releasing factors were examined. Both the putative CR domain (coined for “chain release”) and the NanE (originally thought to encode an epoxide hydrolase) in the *nan* biosynthetic gene cluster appeared to be implicated in polyether chain release, since their in-frame deletion reduced or abolished nanchangmycin production *in vivo*. A recombinant CR domain, a hybrid CR domain with an ACP linked to its amino-terminus (ACP-CR), and recombinant NanE were each expressed as soluble proteins and tested for their ability to hydrolyze a synthetic diketide-SNAC thioester and a polyether-SNAC, respectively (SNAC = *N*-acetylcysteamine). Only NanE hydrolyzed the polyether-SNAC, while both CR and ACP-CR lacked *in vitro* thioesterase activity. By contrast, recombinant DEBS TE (6-deoxyerythronolide B synthase thioesterase) from the erythromycin pathway hydrolyzed the diketide-SNAC substrate but not the polyether-SNAC.³³,⁴³ Although a Type II TE has not been detected in the *nan*

Fig. 8 Proposed post-PKS modifications in nanchangmycin biosynthesis.

biosynthetic gene cluster, recombinant MonAX, a type II TE associated with the polyether monensin biosynthetic pathway, was tested with both substrates and was found to hydrolyse the diketide-SNAC but not the polyether-SNAC.³³,⁴⁴ It was thus concluded that NanE is a novel thioesterase that is responsible for the specific release of the polyether chain from the most downstream ACP in nanchangmycin 10 biosynthesis, and rules out the involvement of either the putative CR or type II TE domains in this process.³³

Analysis of the *nan* biosynthetic pathway genes from *S. nanchangensis* NS 3226 enabled the proposal of a model for nanchangmycin 10 biosynthesis, although the functions of many of the genes still have to be verified. Nanchangmycin 10 biosynthesis (Fig. 8) seems to start with the loading of malonyl-CoA onto the NanA1 protein and, after decarboxylation, would proceed by condensation of nine methylmalonyl-CoA and four malonyl-CoA extender units by the NanA1-NanA10 PKS subunits. Oxidative cyclization seems to be initiated before the PKS chain is released, prior to the last condensation to complete the carbon chain. This would involve a possible double-bond isomerization, resulting in an *E–Z* interconversion at an unknown position, by the putative NanI, two epoxidations of a diene intermediate by an epoxidase (NanO). The process of oxidative cyclization is proposed to occur when the polyketide is still anchored on Nan10, an obvious Type II ACP. After cleavage of the mature polyether chain from the PKS complex by a discrete protein NanE, it would form an uncyclized aglycone. The next step is probably accomplished by the putative NanP monoxygenase, which hydroxylates at C-30. Biosynthesis of 4-*O*-methyl-L-rhodinose presumably starts with D-glucose-1-phosphate, which is converted to 4-*O*-methyl-L-rhodinose, and then attached to the aglycone by the NanG5 glycosyltransferase. However, the recent experiment on the efficient *in vitro* hydrolysis of nanchangmycin-SNAC by recombinant NanE suggested that PKS-bound nanchangmycin could be the natural substrate for the thioesterase, and thus it could not be excluded that hydrolytic release might also occur after glycosylation.³¹,³³

Apparently, identification of 67 constituent active sites (excluding four that are presumably inactive and three that are silent), several putative regulatory genes, functionalities unique for oxidative cyclization to form the polyether structure during polyketide elongation, and a unique enzyme specific for polyether chain release will expand our understanding of the biosynthesis of this important group of anti-coccidial agents and increase our ability to interconvert or modify a wider range of polyketide structures to obtain a greater diversity of macrolides, polyenes and polyethers, and to enhance the yield of nanchangmycin 10 (and its derivatives) by genetic rather than chemical means.

### 3.3 Polyene macrolide antibiotic candicidin (*fsc*) gene cluster

Polyene macrolides, such as amphotericin, nystatin, pimaricin and candicidin (11) (Fig. 9), constitute a large class of natural products, many of which are effective clinical antifungal agents; some of them also have antiviral, antibacterial or immunostimulating activities.⁴⁵ This group of polyketides, characterized by 3–8 conjugated double bonds in the macrolactone ring, usually form *trans*-membrane channels by interacting with sterols in the eukaryotic cell membrane, causing leakage of small molecules and ions and consequent cell death.⁴⁶

![Figure 9](https://i.imgur.com/11candidin.png)

Several gene clusters for the biosynthesis of polyene macrolide antibiotics have been cloned and sequenced following the cloning of the FR-008 polyene gene cluster which elucidated that the polyene macrolide antibiotic was assembled by the modular

polyketide synthase, whose repetitive nature would make it suitable for genetic engineering to design and create novel antibiotic derivatives. The complete gene cluster for biosynthesis of a polyene complex, candidicin/FR-00811, was later demonstrated to span 137.2 kb of the genome of *Streptomyces* sp. FR-008 consisting of six genes for a modular PKS and 15 additional genes for a type II thioesterase, and post-polyketide modifications, as well as for the biosynthesis of the PKS starter unit, sugar biosynthesis, polyene export and transcriptional regulation. The KS (ketosynthase), AT (acyl transferase), KR (keto-reductase), DH (dehydratase), ER (enoyl reductase), ACP (acyl carrier protein) and TE (thioesterase) domains among the distributed modules of the FR-008 PKS were also identified. The extensive resemblances of the genes between *Streptomyces* sp. FR-008 and the partially reported candidicin pathway in *S.* griseus IMRU 3570 led to a chemical comparison between four structurally related members of a FR-008-candidicin antibiotic complex produced by both organisms and the proposal of a genetic-structure relationship for the possible inter-conversion of the members of the FR-008-candidicin complex, as well as a complete picture for overall FR-008-candidicin biosynthesis. A role for PabC, a protein involved in the conversion of 4-amino-4-deoxychorismic acid (synthesized by ADC synthase, PabAB) to PABA, as in *E. coli*, seems to be the first reported in *Streptomyces*. The proposed biosynthetic pathway was recently reviewed by Hill, and no updated information is available.

A study on the regulatory gene of antibiotic FR-008-candidicin 11 also led to the discovery of the positive regulators which are absolutely essential for antibiotic candidicin-FR-008 biosynthesis as the targeted deletion of these genes completely abolished antibiotic production.

### 3.4 Macrolide meilingmycin (*mei*) gene cluster

Apart from producing nanchangmycin 10, *S.* *nanchangensis* NS3226 was known to produce another compound, a 16-membered macrolide, meilingmycin (12), which is slightly different from milbemycin all and has an aglycone and antiparasitic activity similar to those of avermectin (13) (Fig. 10) produced by *Streptomyces avermitilis*. Both meilingmycin 12 and nanchangmycin 10 are very active against a broad spectrum of harmful nematodes and insects, and are non-toxic for mammals and plants. They are both synthesized by modular type I PKSs.

The cluster encoding genes for the biosynthesis of meilingmycin 12 was identified among seven uncharacterized PKS gene clusters isolated from *S.* *nanchangensis* NS3226 by hybridization with PCR products using primers derived from the sequences of *aveE*, *aveF* and a TE domain of the avermectin biosynthetic gene cluster. Introduction of a 24.1 kb deletion by targeted gene replacement resulted in loss of meilingmycin 12 production, confirming that the gene cluster encodes biosynthesis of this important anthelmintic antibiotic compound. A sequenced 8.6 kb fragment had *aveC* and *aveE* homologues (*meiC* and *meiE*) linked together, as in the avermectin gene cluster, but the arrangement of *aveF* (*meiF*) and the TE homologues differs. The information obtained should pave the way to producing novel insecticidal compounds by generating hybrids between meilingmycin 12 and avermectin 13 pathways. The characterization of the differences between the two pathways should help in the generation of novel antibiotic

### 3.5 PKS-NRPS hybrid oxazolomycin (*ozm*) gene cluster (NRPS = non-ribosomal peptide synthetase)

Oxazolomycin (14) (OZM, Fig. 11), produced by *Streptomyces albus* JA 3453, is a hybrid peptide-polyketide antibiotic structurally characterized by a unique spiro-linked β-lactone/γ-lactam moiety, an oxazole ring, an (E,E)-diene, and a (Z,Z,E)-triene chain. OZM 14 exhibits potent antitumor, antiviral, but limited antibacterial activities. Using degenerate primers to clone genes encoding methoxy-malonyl-acyl carrier protein (ACP) biosynthesis as probes, a 135 kb DNA region from *S.* *albus* JA 3453 was cloned and localized to cover the entire *ozm* biosynthetic gene cluster. Sequence analysis of a 12 kb DNA fragment from the specific region revealed six genes likely responsible for methoxy-malonyl-ACP biosynthesis (Table 2). The involvement of the genes in OZM 14 biosynthesis was proven directly by mutational analysis of selected genes, *ozmF* encoding a methyltransferase and *ozmC* encoding a ketoacyl synthase, within this locus. These results have now set the stage for a full investigation of OZM 14 biosynthesis and for generation of novel OZM analogs by combinatorial biosynthesis methods in *S.* *albus*.

The successful cloning and identification of the methoxy-malonyl-ACP biosynthesis locus from *S.* *albus* and confirmation of its essential role in OZM 14 biosynthesis provided direct evidence supporting the methoxy-malonate origin of the C3-C4 moiety of OZM 14. It also enabled mapping of the entire

ozm gene cluster by chromosomal walking from this locus. Five overlapping cosmids that cover about 135 kb of the DNA flanking both sides of the methoxy-malonyl-ACP biosynthesis locus had been identified.$^{51}$ While the three orfs, $orf(-3)$ to $orf(-1)$, likely represent the upstream boundary of the ozm cluster on the basis of sequence analysis, preliminary sequence scanning of the 125 kb DNA downstream of the methoxy-malonyl-ACP biosynthetic locus has indicated that it most likely covers the rest of the ozm cluster, including at least a total of ten PKS modules and three NRPS modules for the assembly of the hybrid peptide-polyketide backbone of OZM 14 from the carboxylic acid and amino acid precursors. One of the cloned genes ($ozmB$) with a 40 kDa predicted protein (OzmB) within the haloacid dehalogenase (HAD) superfamily, was unambiguously shown to divert the primary metabolite 1,3-diphosphoglycerate into the polyketide biosynthetic pathway as glycerate via loading of a carrier protein. Dorrestein et al. monitored each of the steps—activation of D-3-phosphoglycerate, dephosphorylation while attached to a cysteine on OzmB, and subsequent transfer of glycerate to the phosphopantetheinyl thiol of an acyl carrier protein by nanospray Fourier transform mass spectrometry, and demonstrated that the activation of phosphoglycerate represents a general mechanism of diverting glycolytic metabolites into glyceryl-derived polyketides.$^{52}$

OZM 14 represents a family of natural products with unprecedented structural architectures and promising biological activities. The development of an expedient genetic system for *S. albus* and localization of the entire ozm cluster set the stage to fully characterize OZM 14 biosynthesis by both in vivo and in vitro methods. The unique structure of 14 and its analogs holds great promise of discovering novel genes, as exemplified by $ozmC$ that is absent from all other methoxy-malonyl-ACP biosynthetic loci known to date, and novel chemistry for natural product biosynthesis, such as enzymes catalyzing spiro-linked-lactone/-lactam biosynthesis and PKS and/or tailoring enzymes controlling the $(E,E)$-diene and $(Z,Z,E)$-triene stereochemistry during polyketide elongation. The rich biological activities of OZM 14 and its analogs support it as a privileged molecular scaffold for drug discovery and development, and application of combinatorial biosynthesis methods to that could potentially lead to the generation of novel analogs as clinically useful agents.

3.6 Peptidyl nucleotide nikkomycin (san) gene cluster

Peptidyl nucleoside antibiotic nikkomycins are potent competitive inhibitors of chitin synthase which are strongly fungicidal, insecticidal, and acaricidal as a result of their structural similarity to UDP-$N$-acetylglucosamine. They were firstly isolated from *Streptomyces tendae* Tü 901 and later found in *Streptomyces ansochromogenes* as a mixture with nikkomycin X (15), Z (16), I (17), and J (18) as the main components (Fig. 12).$^{53,54}$ 4-Formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one is the base of the X series whereas uracil is present in the Z series. The corresponding nucleoside moieties are designated as nikkomycin Cx (19) and Cz (20), respectively. The nikkomycin biosynthetic gene cluster (nik) was first cloned in *S. tendae* by Bormann et al. and more recently in *S. ansochromogenes* with degenerate primers based on the N-terminal peptide sequence of protein P6 by Tan et al.$^{54,55}$ In a 35 kb sequenced region, 25 ORFs (san) were identified and showed significant homology with its counterparts from *S. tendae*, 23 of which were proposed to be involved in nikkomycin biosynthesis (Fig. 13 and Table 3).$^{56}$

![Figure 12](#fig12)

A total of 12 structural genes had been inactivated and were all confirmed to be related to nikkomycin biosynthesis.$^{54,57-64}$ The requirements of SanA, SanB, SanC, SanH, SanK, SanL and SanS for nikkomycin biosynthesis were proven through gene inactivation and/or complementation. Inactivation of $sanO$

or *sanQ* generated mutants producing only nikkomycin Z16, which suggested that the NRPS SanO and the cytochrome P450 oxidase SanQ participated in the biosynthesis of the 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one moiety present in nikkomycin X15.$^{62,65}$ Their counterparts in the *nik* cluster were recently confirmed to be responsible for the biosynthesis of β-hydroxy-l-histidine, an immediate precursor for the synthesis of 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one.$^{66}$

SanJ was proven to be essential for the formation of hydroxypyridylhomothreonine (HPHT) as an ATP-dependent picolinate-CoA ligase through gene inactivation, complementation, and *in vitro* characterization. Inactivation of *sanJ* completely abolished the productivity of nikkomycin X15 and Z16.$^{67}$ Using picolinate (21) as the substrate with the presence of ATP, heterologously expressed and purified SanJ converted picolinate to picolinate-CoA (22) with a $K_{cat}$ of $0.488 \pm 0.036 \, \text{min}^{-1}$ (Fig. 14). Moreover, SanJ could catalyze the conversions of benzoate and nicotinate to their corresponding CoA esters and 4-methoxybenzoate and 4-hydroxybenzoate to their respective AMP (adenosine 5'-monophosphate) derivatives.$^{57}$

Another pair of genes, *sanU* and *sanV*, were also proven to be involved in the biosynthesis of HPHT, which show significant homology with chain S and chain E of the glutamate mutase from *Clostridium cochlearium*. Inactivation of *sanV* resulted in the loss of nikkomycin X15 and Z16 but the accumulation of nikkomycin Ox and Oz without the methyl group at C3 of HPHT, unambiguously demonstrating the involvement of SanV in HPHT formation.$^{63}$ *In vitro* characterization of SanU and SanV not only revealed the common coenzyme B12 binding feature of glutamate

mutases, but also proved their ability of converting glutamate to 3-methylaspartate (23), another immediate precursor for HPHT biosynthesis (Fig. 15).$^{58}$

3.7 Spirotetronate chlorothricin (*chl*) gene cluster

Chlorothricin (CHL) (24) was the first structurally elucidated member of the spirotetronate family containing a unique tetranic

Recently Liu and co-workers cloned the biosynthetic gene cluster of CHL (chl) from *S. antibioticus* DSM 40725, a first member for spirotetronate antibiotic biosynthesis. Two strategies were successfully applied for the cloning of the chl gene cluster. With the degenerate primers specifically designed for the intermodular ACP-KS of the usual type I PKS, two different sets of PCR products were amplified, cloned and both confirmed to be involved in CHL 24 biosynthesis through gene disruptions. The presence of a modified 6-methylsalicyclic acid (6-MSA) moiety in CHL 24 suggested its formation catalyzed by iterative type I PKS, which is similar to the biosyntheses of the orsellinic acid moiety for avilamycin (AviM) and calicheamicin (CalO5) and the naphthoic acid moiety for neocarzinostatin (NcsB). The degenerate primers were designed according to the most conserved motifs in the KS-AT di-domain of aligned iterative type I PKS, including AviM, CalO5 and NcsB. Using amplified products from these two strategies as the probes for Southern hybridizations, a 122 kb contiguous DNA with 42 ORFs was mapped and sequenced (Fig. 17 and Table 4). The boundaries of the chl gene cluster were defined through several gene inactivations on both ends of the sequenced region. In the 5' termini, inactivation of *orf(-I)* had no effect but the downstream *chlC7* was proved essential on CHL 24 production. In the 3' termini, both *chlD3* and *chlD4* were found to be required for CHL 24 biosynthesis whereas several attempts to inactivate the downstream *orf36* and *orf37* failed, whose functions were proposed to be indispensable for the replication of a giant linear plasmid carrying the *chl* gene cluster. Therefore, it was concluded that 35 genes are needed for CHL 24 biosynthesis.

With the amplified DNA for the KS-AT di-domain as probes, an earlier attempt had resulted in the cloning of a 10 kb DNA fragment with 6 ORFs. Gene *chlB1*, the largest one, showed the highest homology to *aviM*, *calO5*, and *ncsB*. The deduced 1756 aa ChlB1 is composed of characteristic domains for type I PKS including a KS, AT, DH, KR, and ACP. Direct evidence for the involvement of *chlB1* in the biosynthesis of 2-methoxy-5-chloro-6-methylsalicyclic acid was obtained from gene inactivation. In the *chlB1* mutant, no CHL 24 was detected and instead DM-CHL (25) (DM = desmethylsalicylcyl) was isolated and confirmed by HR-MS and NMR. The exact role of ChlB1 as a 6-MSA

Including the putative halogenase ChlB4 and methyltransferase ChlB5, a pathway starting with ChlB1 was proposed for the formation of the 2-methoxy-5-chloro-6-methylsalicylic acid moiety (Fig. 18). Moreover, ChlB6 was proven to be involved in the biosynthesis of this moiety as well.

In the *chl* gene cluster, a set of 5 genes (*chlC1–chlC5*) were identified to be homologous to genes for D-olivose biosynthesis from mithramycin and chromomycin producers. Two glycosyl-transferase genes, *chlC6* and *chlC7*, were found in the cluster and proposed for the tandem transferring of the two olivose to the CHL aglycone. On the other hand, another set of 4 genes (*chlD1–chlD4*) was proposed for the incorporation of the three-carbon atoms, C22, C23, and C24, derived from glycerol.

Six multifunctional type I PKS, ChlA1–ChlA6, are arranged collinear with their functions in the biosynthetic process except for the DH domain in module 8 of ChlA4, which lacks conserved

amino acid residues and is predicated to be inactive. Two propionates and nine acetates are proposed to be assembled into the nascent tetracosanoyl-S-ACP intermediate via 11 decarboxylation steps. While the nascent polyketide chain is still attached to the PKS, the trans-decalin system might be formed enantioselectively via an intramolecular Diels–Alder reaction by addition of the C4–C5 dienophile to the C10–C13 diene. Release of the polyketide intermediate was probably catalyzed by ChlD4 using the hydroxyl group of enolpyruvate as the nucleophile and followed with an intramolecular cyclization to form the tetranoic acid moiety. A further Diels–Alder reaction could occur by the addition of the C2–C3 dienophile of the 3-C unit to the C20–C23 diene of the polyketide, resulting in the formation of the cyclohexene ring, closing of the macrolide ring, and production of the putative chlorothricolide. The formation of the final product, CHL 24, requires subsequent modification including a Baeyer–Villiger oxidation converting the acyltetranic acid into a mactocyclic lactone, oxidation of the C20 methyl to a carboxylic group, consecutive transferring of the two olivose moieties, and the final attachment of the 2-methoxy-5-chloro-6-methylsalicyclic acid moiety to the C3 hydroxyl group of the second olivose moiety.

briefly described here. It is anticipated that such work may well trigger further exciting studies and developments of metabolic engineering research in China.

### 4.1 Generation of candicidin aglycones without a sugar moiety or with an altered sugar moiety

Polyene antibiotics are generally fungicidal. Candicidin 11 is also effective against prostatic hyperplasia, is hypocholesterolemic and is mosquito larvaecidal. Using the genetic information of the $fsc$ gene cluster, a first set of novel derivative compounds were obtained by the targeted disruption of a gene encoding a putative glycosyltransferase (FscMI), which led to loss of the mycosamine moiety to produce a set of five novel non-mycosaminated candicidin aglycones (Fig. 19). Targeted disruption of the transaminase gene involved in mycosamine biosynthesis resulted in a second set of three candicidin derivative compounds with the attachment of a deaminated sugar moiety (Fig. 20). The fact that the candicidin aglycones without a sugar moiety were found to be the predominant products in the same mutant confirms the role of FscMI as a relatively flexible glycosyltransferase. Conceivably, this observation would open more possibilities for flexible tailoring by attachment of the altered sugars to the FR-008/candicidin aglycones to create great diversity of compounds. These sets of novel derivative compounds retained their fungicidal activities.

4 Examples of over-production and generation of unnatural natural compounds by metabolic engineering

Apparently, progress made over the last few years has contributed significantly to our understanding of a variety of classes of natural antibiotic compounds, and has made it possible to broaden the scope for the over-production of antibiotics and generation of novel compounds using more rational approaches as the investigation of the existing and new additions of antibiotic gene clusters deepens at all levels, using systems developed in different labs and methodology developed with international joint effort. Indeed, our ability to generate novel unnatural natural compounds by targeted engineering using these gene clusters, or in combination with genes from other pathways, e.g. to interconvert or modify a wider range of polyketide structures to obtain a greater diversity of macrolides, polyenes and polyethers, and to enhance their production titer by genetic rather than chemical means has increased dramatically. Some successful examples of designing and engineering for the generation of novel compounds using combinatorial biosynthetic and other related methods are
although the activity diversity was not further examined yet. In addition, the efficient genetic manipulation of the *fsc* gene cluster demonstrated clearly that *Streptomyces* sp. FR-008 could serve as a model strain for either fundamental or applied research aiming at the generation or inter-conversion of novel polyenes or related compounds using the FR-008/candicidin gene clusters, or in combination with genes from other pathways by metabolic engineering.

### 4.2 Generation of a novel nanchangmycin aglycone by in-frame deletion of the KR6 domain

The KR6 domain of module 6 in NanA4 of the nanchangmycin biosynthetic pathway is assumed to be responsible for the appearance of a hydroxyl group at the C-19 position of nanchangmycin 10.³¹ As expected, an engineered mutant producing an aglycone (Fig. 21) with loss of 4-*O*-methyl-L-rhodinose at C19 was created successfully by targeted in-frame deletion of the KR6 domain of module 6 in NanA4, confirming a close correlation between chemical structure and protein functionalities for nanchangmycin 10 biosynthesis. The loss of 4-*O*-methyl-L-rhodinose at C19 also correlated with the loss of antibacterial activity displayed by nanchangmycin.³¹ This is again a good demonstration of the feasibility to create novel antibiotic derivatives with changed activities by targeted engineering of antibiotic biosynthetic pathway genes.

### 4.3 Engineered acylation of spiramycin

Acylation on the backbone or various sugar moieties is very crucial for the activities of a few antibiotics, such as carbomycin, midecamycin, and ansamitocins. Wang *et al.* had cloned the 4″-isovaleryltransferase gene *carE* from a carbomycin producer and stably inserted this gene into the chromosome of *Streptomyces spiramyceticus* F21, the producer of spiramycin.⁷² The engineered strain carrying *carE* produced new spiramycin derivatives with various acyl groups on the 4″ position of the mycarose moiety. Spiramycin with an isovaleryl group, named as biotechmycin, is the main product and exhibits improved anti-bacterial activities than acetyl-spiramycin, midecamycin, and erythromycin. Its clinical trial is in Phase II, which showed promising treatment effects.

### 4.4 Selective over-production of specific antibiotics in a producer for multiple compounds or components by metabolic engineering

The identification and isolation of multiple PKS genes in a single strain could provide an opportunity for isolating *S. nanchangensis* derivatives that produce only one of the antibiotics but in increased quantities, as the biosynthesis of compounds derived from similar precursors in the same cell might be competitive. Thus an increase or selective antibiotic production was tried by selective cluster-specific mutagenesis by gene replacement, as was demonstrated. Indeed, the deletion of a large DNA fragment by gene replacement in one PKS gene cluster resulted in at least a three-times increase of nanchangmycin 10 production, but no obvious increase in meilingmycin 12 production was detected in the disrupted strains for either of the other three PKS gene clusters.³ This result demonstrated clearly that unknown or unwanted clusters encoding related compounds could be deleted stepwise, and such targeted deletions should have no danger of introducing deleterious mutations elsewhere in the chromosome, which would otherwise affect, for example, cell growth.

In the strain producing the FR-008/candicidin complex, site-directed mutation of particular domains of polyketide synthase from the *fsc* gene cluster clearly resulted in the disappearance of some specific components but over-production of the others, offering us additional ways of achieving the selective production of specific components by a genetic approach (Zhou YJ *et al.*, unpublished).

### 4.5 Yield improvement for nikkomycin biosynthesis

Antibiotic productivity is often affected by the regulation of antibiotic pathways by global or pathway-specific regulators, expression level of the structural genes, availability of precursors and co-factors, and export of the product out of the cells.

Limiting steps are often found in antibiotic biosynthesis, which could be elevated through improved transcription with strong promoters or increased copy numbers on multi-copy-number plasmids. Since *sanU* and *sanV* were found to be essential for the biosynthesis of the HPHT moiety, a 3.0 kb DNA fragment containing *sanU* and *sanV* was placed downstream of the strong promoter of melanin genes from pIJ702, which was inserted into the chromosome of *S. ansochromogenes* via the attachment site of *Streptomyces* phage θC31. The yield of nikkomycins in the recombinant strain was increased by 80% compared with that of the wild-type.⁵⁸ SanO, the NRPS responsible for the formation of the 4-formyl-4-imidazolin-2-one moiety present only in nikkomycin X15, was proven to have a more significant effect specifically on nikkomycin X15 production. An extra copy of *sanO* with its original promoter was also inserted into the chromosome of *S. ansochromogenes*, and the recombinant strains produced twice as much as the nikkomycin X15 produced by the wild-type strain, while the yield of nikkomycin Z16 was unaffected.⁵⁹

Increased expression of positive regulators and removal of negative regulators are among the most effective ways to enhance antibiotic production. SanG from the *san* gene cluster was identified as a positive regulator affecting both morphological differentiation and nikkomycin production.⁵⁶ The deletion of *sanG* in *S. ansochromogenes* completely abolished nikkomycin production. Complementation of the mutant with one copy of *sanG* with its native promoter only recovered nikkomycin production at a very low level. However, when the same DNA fragment was cloned on a multi-copy-number plasmid and introduced into the mutant, the recombinant derivatives yielded twice as much nikkomycin as that produced by the wild-type strain.⁵⁶

### 4.6 Direct production of ivermectin through domain swapping

Ivermectin, the 22,23-dihydroavermectin B1 (Fig. 22), is widely used in livestock production, in the healthcare of companion

animals, and the treatment of African river blindness. It shows the same effective antiparasitic activity but lower toxicity than avermectins. The high cost of ivermectin production is due to the region-specific hydrogenation at C22–C23 of avermectin B1 with rhodium chloride. Avermectins are biosynthesized by a type I PKS (ave) with only KR and DH present in module 2, which is responsible for the generation of C22–C23 double bonds or the C23 hydroxyl group in *S. avermitilis*.^{73}

Assuming a complete reduction cycle including ketoreduction, dehydration, and enoylreduction would result in a saturated bond between C22–C23, Zhang *et al.* searched the PKS database for a KR-ER-DH tri-domain to replace the KR-DH di-domain of module 2 from the ave gene cluster. ^{73} Module 4 containing the KR-ER-DH tri-domain from pikromycin PKS showed the highest homology with module 2 from the ave gene cluster and was chosen for the replacement purpose. ^{74} In *S. avermitilis* Olm73–12, an engineered strain producing only avermectin B and not avermectin A and oligomycin, KR-DH of module 2 was replaced by KR-ER-DH from the pikromycin PKS through homologous recombination (Fig. 22). ^{75} Albeit in a low quantity, ivermectin was successfully produced in the newly engineered strain along with avermectin B. The direct production of ivermectin in *S. avermitilis* sets the stage for the optimization of domain swapping and fermentation conditions to maximize ivermectin production.
