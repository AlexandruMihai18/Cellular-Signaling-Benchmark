## Summary

The dimeric form of the kinesin motor and neck domain from rat brain with bound ADP has been solved by X-ray crystallography. The two heads of the dimer are connected via a coiled-coil α-helical interaction of their necks. They are broadly similar to one another; differences are most apparent in the head-neck junction and in a moderate reorientation of the neck helices in order to adopt to the coiled-coil conformation. The heads show a rotational symmetry (∼120°) about an axis close to that of the coiled-coil. This arrangement is unexpected since it is not compatible with the microtubule lattice. In this arrangement, the two heads of a kinesin dimer could not have equivalent interactions with microtubules.

## Introduction

Motor proteins are mechanochemical enzymes that translate the energy of nucleotide hydrolysis into directed movement. The best known motors are those of the myosin family, which move along actin filaments, and the family of kinesin-like motors that move along microtubules. Structural information is needed to explain how ATP hydrolysis is translated into movement. For actin-based motors, the major breakthroughs were the X-ray structure of the myosin motor domain (Rayment et al., 1993a), the X-ray structure of actin (Kabsch et al., 1990), and studies of the actomyosin complex by fiber diffraction (Lorenz et al., 1993) and image reconstruction (Rayment et al., 1993b; Schröder et al., 1993; Whittaker et al., 1996). The combination of data has put a molecular description of myosin’s motility within reach (the swinging lever hypothesis; for review see Rayment, 1996; Holmes, 1997). One important remaining puzzle is the question why many myosins come in pairs: is their dimerization necessary for efficient movement, for regulation, or for other tasks? These problems are difficult to answer in structural terms because no structure of dimeric myosin is available so far.

Microtubule-based transport has a more recent history, starting with the observation of ATP-dependent proteins in axonal transport and the isolation of kinesin based on video microscopic assays of movement (Brady, 1985; Vale et al., 1985). From a structural point of view, the major breakthrough was the recent X-ray analysis of the head domains of kinesin and the related motor ncd (Kull et al., 1996; Sablin et al., 1996). The protein has the architecture of an α/β protein, with a central β sheet sandwiched between three α helices on either side. The structure showed a surprising similarity to other nucleotide-binding proteins such as G proteins (e.g., the GTP-binding domains of p21ras, Ga, or elongation factor Tu) or the ATP-binding domain of myosin. In particular, the homology with myosin sparked expectations that the two motor proteins might exhibit a similar mechanism of motility. There was, however, one missing link: the lever, an α-helical neck domain, was clearly visible in the myosin structure, but absent from the kinesin or ncd structures, presumably due to disorder. In the myosin-like model of kinesin, it was therefore anticipated that the neck helix would have a similar position and orientation as in myosin. Recently we completed a structure of the monomeric head domain from rat kinesin (RK354, residues 2–354), which showed better order and therefore revealed the N-terminal residues and the beginning of the C-terminal α helix of the neck (Sack et al., submitted). The most surprising result was the position of this neck, which was diametrically opposed to what one had expected. The structure seemed incompatible with a lever-type mechanism analogous to that of myosin, and the structure did not reveal obvious clues on how kinesin might move. However, as in the case of myosin, one could argue that another missing link for models of motility might be hidden in the structure of the dimer. Most motors of the kinesin family exist in the form of dimers whose conformation might differ from that of the monomers. We therefore studied a dimeric construct of rat kinesin, RK379, by X-ray diffraction and report the results here.

## Results

Figure 1 summarizes the domain composition of kinesin and the secondary structure elements of the motor domain. One can distinguish the head (residues 1–330), neck (330–380), several segments of the stalk (up to residue 910, mostly coiled-coil), and the C-terminal tail (910–955). Our initial work (Sack et al., submitted) dealt with the head plus the beginning of the neck (up to residue 354), which was insufficient for dimerization, whereas the longer construct RK379 dimerizes by virtue of coiled-coil interactions. There are ∼5 predicted heptad repeats typical of coiled-coils, with mostly hydrophobic residues in the a and d positions (boxed). Most of these indeed form the interface between the two neck helices, starting at Ala-339 (see below). The head domain contains a core β sheet with five major and several minor strands numbered β0–β10, sandwiched between six α helices (α1–α6), three on either side; their position along the sequences is shaded in Figure 1.

Figure 1. Bar Diagram of Whole Kinesin (Top) and Magnified Head and Neck Domain (Below) Highlighting Structure Elements

Kinesin contains a motor domain (head), a rod domain (shaded in top diagram, coiled-coil neck, stalk 1, stalk 2, interrupted by non-helical regions around residues 390 and 580), and a tail. The middle diagram shows the head and neck. Helical regions are dark gray, the main helices are numbered below (α0–α7, α7 being the neck helix). The β-strands are light gray (β0–β10). Some of the intervening loops are labeled inside the bar (L4, L11, and L12). Residues numbers are indicated above the bar, as well as regions implicated in nucleotide and microtubule binding (N1-N4, MT1, and MT2; nomenclature following Kull et al., 1996). The bottom line shows the enlarged neck sequence. Residues that fit the heptad repeats typical of coiled-coils are labeled a and d; hydrophobic ones are highlighted. Note that the hydrophobic nature of the interface is more pronounced in the second half of the neck (Leu-356 and following). The coiled-coil structure is observed from Ala-339 onward.

helix α7 is the neck. The core of the motor is similar in kinesin and the retrograde motor ncd. In our terminology of structure elements, we adhere largely to that of Kull et al. (1996), with extensions to accommodate the new features.

Two views of the structure are presented in Figure 2. The upper head in Figure 2A (head A, pale colors) is shown roughly in the standard orientation, that is, the core β sheet (blue) is viewed nearly face-on, helices α1–α3 are in front of the sheet, and α4–α6 are in the back. In this orientation, the ADP binding site is also in front (base and ribose shown in orange, phosphates in yellow) while the presumptive microtubule binding site is in the back (green). There are also several features not seen by Kull et al. (1996) because of disorder, namely the N-terminal strand β0 and the C-terminal strands β9 and β10, all connected to the core sheet by parallel or antiparallel strand interactions. Moreover, our monomer structure had shown that the initial segment of the neck helix points to the left in this orientation, along the plane of the paper. The same is observed for head A in the dimer, showing that the head-neck junction is not greatly perturbed by dimerization (see below). The neck of the second head B runs roughly in the same direction, such that the two necks include an angle of about 20°, which is typical of coiled-coils. Notice that when head A is in the standard orientation, the initial part of neck A (pale red) lies in front of neck B (red). This restricts possible models of motility (see below).

The relationship between the two heads is best seen in the symmetric view of Figure 2B. This is obtained by rotating the standard view 65° about the vertical axis,

Figure 2. Different Views of Dimeric Kinesin

(A) Structure of dimeric kinesin in ribbon representation, viewing the core β sheet of the upper head (A) roughly face-on. β-strands are light blue, and α helices are pink. Regions thought to be involved in microtubule binding are colored green (on the back, loop L7-β5-L8a = MT1, L12 = MT2), and regions involved in nucleotide binding are purple (loops at the upper end of strands β1, β3, β7, and β6, containing motifs N4, N1, N3 = switch II, and N2 = switch I). The nucleotide (ADP) is shown as a space-filling model (orange = base and ribose, and yellow = phosphates). In the upper head, the α helices α1–α3 are in front and α4–α6 are behind the core sheet, and the neck helix α7 runs to the left roughly in the plane of the paper. The lower head B presents a tilted view roughly onto the back side (only a few elements are labeled). Note also that the neck of head A (pink) lies in front of neck B (red). The model includes residues 2–240 and 256–370; residue 1 is missing due to bacterial processing, and residues 241–255 (loop L11) and 371–379 are not visible due to disorder.

(B) Symmetric view of the dimer, down the rotation axis (perpendicular to the plane of the paper indicated by the triangle near the beginning of neck A). The structure is rotated about 65° with respect to (A) about a vertical axis in the plane of the paper. Thus, the upper head A is seen roughly as in the view of Kull et al. (1996) (core β sheet seen roughly edge-on in head A, as if viewed from the right side of Figure 2A; neck helices pointing away from the observer). Notice that the two heads are related by a rotation of 120°. The angle between the rotation axis and the axis of the coiled-coil is about 25°.

so that the neck helices point away from the observer. The structure appears like a V, with the opening of the V to the right. The nucleotide binding regions (purple) face toward the observer since they lie at the top of the structure in the standard view. This orientation is close to the Kull view, where the core sheet is seen roughly edge-on(see Kull et al., 1996, Figure 1). The most striking feature of the symmetric view is that the two heads are related roughly by a rotation of 120° about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the paper, the opening angle of the V. The symmetric view is therefore equivalent to a view down the rotation axis, which is located near the junction of the two necks (passing through the beginning of neck A, triangle in Figure 2B). The rotation axis points about 25° away from the coiled-coil axis. Since microtubules do not contain subunits related by a 120° rotation, it is clear that the structure of the kinesin dimer is not compatible with the two heads binding to the microtubule surface in equivalent positions.

We can distinguish two types of contacts between the two subunits. One is the extensive interaction between the coiled-coil neck helices (see below), the other is the local interaction (dotted line) between loop L8b from the A subunit (containing ${}^{160}$KNR at the tip) and loop L10 from the B subunit (containing ${}^{219}$ETE). Note the opposite charges of these protruding loops, which suggests ionic interactions (possibly a salt bridge between K160 and E221, which is however not well defined at our resolution). This could fix the relative orientation of the two subunits.

One may ask whether the differences in orientation in heads A and B correspond to changes in chain folding. Such differences do exist, but they are remarkably small. Figure 3A shows superimposed backbone diagrams of head A (blue) with head B after optimal alignment (red). The two chains superimpose well in the head domain (rms deviation between the Cα positions of the two heads is 0.48 Å), and they begin to diverge at Asn-334, the beginning of strand β10. This is accompanied by related changes at the bottom of strands β7 and β6, to which β10 is connected by H bonds. The net result is a change of ~30° in orientation of the neck helix. A similar picture emerges when we superimpose the monomeric kinesin (RK354, green, rms deviation 0.71 Å). Again, most of the divergence occurs past Asn-334 and in the adjacent β strands. The neck helix of the monomer protrudes roughly in the same direction as that of head A. In both structures, the bound nucleotide is ADP, and the binding pocket is indeed quite similar. Notably there is no pronounced rearrangement in the region of the nucleotide or the switch loops that might reflect different conformational states.

The coiled-coil interactions of the necks are illustrated in Figure 3B. There is a good agreement between the actual structure and the predicted juxtaposition of the heptad positions a and d between residues 339 and 370. Note the match of hydrophobic side chains in the C-terminal half of the neck (L356, I360, L363, and L367), forming a hydrophobic interface that is also responsible for tight dimerization (Morii et al., 1997; Tripet et al., 1997). The kinesin neck contains three features reminiscent of the coiled-coils of DNA-binding proteins such as GCN4 (Alber, 1992). This includes an accumulation

of charged residues with extended aliphatic chains (e.g., Lys, Glu; see residues 340–352), which point away from the coiled-coil core. This feature is thought to contribute stability (via the aliphatic chains) while still maintaining solubility. The high concentration of charged residues in the initial part of the neck may also be of importance in the interaction with tubulin. Another feature unexpected for coiled-coils but also found in GCN4 is the hydrophilic residue N353 in an a position at the center of the coiled-coil. Thirdly, there are pairs of charged residues at positions a−1 and the following d+1 (e.g., K345-K350, K352-K357, and E366-R371). These are placed near one another on one face of the coiled-coil and could therefore have a stabilizing or destabilizing influence. Finally, an unusual feature is the charged E349 in a d position, which adds another repulsive ionic interaction. This d residue E349 and the a residue N353 are conserved among kinesin-like proteins with neck domains, suggesting that destabilization of the coiled-coil may be of functional significance.

Judging from the sequence, the α helix would be expected to start around L335 since this is the first hydrophobic residue that fits into the heptad repeat (a d position). The observed beginning is at A339, one helical turn later. This delayed onset is not due to the dimerization since it is also observed in the structure of the monomer. On the C-terminal end, the electron density largely disappears at W370 and beyond, even though the sequence extends to residue D379. This is presumably due to disorder and agrees well with the interruption of the heptad repeat between W370 and V406. This region is likely to represent the hinge between the neck and the extended stalk, which is susceptible to proteolytic cleavage and highly flexible (Scholey et al., 1989; Hunt and Howard, 1993). It would therefore not contribute to the dimerization of kinesin.

The charge distribution in the dimer is also remarkable: there is a segregation between positively charged regions on the back and negative ones on the front surface. This feature—already visible in the monomer—becomes even more pronounced in the dimer (Figure 4). There is a negatively charged saddle lining the surface across both heads, formed largely by the exposed acidic residues on helices α2, α3, loop L6, and loop L10. This feature puts strong constraints on possible interactions with microtubules since their surface is strongly negative and therefore would attract positive domains in kinesin.


Discussion

Since we have now at hand an X-ray structure of a dimeric motor protein, we can ask several questions related to the mechanism of motility. For example, since the dimer is thought to be the physiologically important unit, can we detect significant conformational differences between the heads? These might shed light on models derived from the kinetics of nucleotide turnover and suggesting an interaction between the heads (e.g., alternating head catalysis and others, Hackney, 1994; Moyer et al., 1996; Ma and Taylor, 1997). Secondly, since most models of movement assume that both heads of

dimer to adopt a coiled-coil structure, without major effects on the motor domain. In summary, from the comparison between the dimeric and monomeric conformations of kinesin, we conclude that the two heads of a dimer are similar when the bound nucleotide is ADP.

Arrangement of the Heads in the Kinesin Dimer and Comparison with Models of Motility

To generate movement, kinesin is thought to undergo conformational changes (within a given head) and in addition change the arrangement of the two heads relative to one another and relative to the underlying microtubule lattice (walking, rotation, etc.). We can therefore ask how the two heads of a dimer could interact with different tubulin subunits in a microtubule lattice. The surface lattice of microtubules is characterized by the 5 nm lateral separation of protofilaments, the 4 nm axial separation of tubulin monomers, and the 8 nm axial separation of α-β-tubulin heterodimers (cf. ellipses, Figure 5). Several biochemical studies have shown that each tubulin heterodimer can bind one kinesin head; the main interaction is with β tubulin, but there is also some overlap with α tubulin (Song and Mandelkow, 1993; Walker, 1995; Tucker and Goldstein, 1997). Thus, if the two heads of a kinesin dimer were to interact equivalently with tubulin dimers, it should be possible to overlay the kinesin structure with the microtubule lattice in some orientation, such that the condition of equivalent interaction is met. This is, however, not possible. The reasons are apparent from Figure 2B: the two kinesin heads are related roughly by a rotation of 120°, which is not present in the microtubule lattice. The arrangement of the kinesin heads is therefore not compatible with current models of kinesin’s movement along microtubules (reviewed by Block, 1995; Cross, 1995; Howard, 1996).

Figure 5 illustrates the discrepancies one encounters when trying to fit the observed kinesin structure with the microtubule lattice. In Figure 5A, we show an arrangement that one might anticipate for walking models. Here, three kinesin heads are positioned in identical orientations and with a common scale on a microtubule lattice. The orientation of the kinesin head on the microtubule surface is not known, but a plausible choice is that of Figure 2A (top) because this puts the putative microtubule-binding loops in contact with the underlying tubulin (loops L7, L12, as suggested by Kull et al., 1996). To form a dimer, the heads could be paired up in at least three ways, side-by-side (black-green), one above the other (black-blue), or diagonally (blue-green) across a unit cell of tubulin dimers, 5 × 8 nm. Two problems become obvious: neither of the pairing schemes places the neck helices near one another in register to allow a coiled-coil, and the neck helices are tangential to the microtubule surface, rather than sticking out toward the observer, as is the case for the lever arm of myosin (Holmes, 1997).

For the side-by-side pairing (black-green), one way out of the dilemma would be to turn the heads 90° about the vertical axis so that the neck helices would point away from the microtubule (toward the observer) and nearly in register. By loosening their connection to the

Figure 4. Surface Potential Map of Kinesin

Shown is the symmetric view, as in Figure 2B (negative charges red, positive charges blue). Note the negatively charged saddle lining the surface across the two heads, formed by the acidic residues on helices α2, α3, loop L6, and loop L10. Drawing by GRASP (Nicholls et al., 1991).

a dimer can interact with the microtubule (see Cross, 1995; Block, 1995; Howard, 1996), does the arrangement of heads in a kinesin dimer distinguish between different models? Finally, how does the crystal structure of the dimer compare with other structural data, notably electron microscopy and image reconstruction?

Conformations of the Kinesin Heads

If we compare the three kinesin heads (monomer of RK354 and the two heads of the dimer, RK379) the overall impression is that the conformation is rather robust (Figure 3A). Within the motor domain itself, some minor rearrangements are visible, but most parts of the chain superimpose very well. In particular, the agreement is excellent in the region of the nucleotide binding pocket and in the switch regions (Figure 2). With the caveat that the resolution of the dimer is only 3 Å, we can conclude that the dimerization of the head per se leaves the conformation nearly unchanged. Since the bound nucleotide is ADP, it is likely that in all three cases the observed conformation is that of the detached or the weakly bound state of kinesin (Crevel et al., 1996) and that this conformation does not depend on dimerization. In particular, we note that the loop L11, containing a possible microtubule-binding site, is disordered in the three head structures.

Differences in conformation become more pronounced in the neck helix and in the head-neck junction. The simplest description is that the neck helices protrude at somewhat different angles. However, considering that the neck is only loosely tied to the bulk of the motor domain and thus might have sufficient freedom to adopt many orientations, the close agreement between the three structures suggests that the general orientation of the neck is an intrinsic feature of the head-neck interaction. The observed differences could largely be explained by the propensity of the two neck helices of the

have to untie the coiled-coil, allowing each head to detach and reattach at some distance. Indeed, most illustrations of walking models anticipate this because the necks are drawn as if they were free (e.g., Cross, 1995; Hirose et al., 1995).

As a contrast to the previous discussion, Figure 5B shows the observed dimer arrangement, with head A in the orientation as in Figure 2A in order to meet the requirement of microtubule binding at the rear side. It is obvious that the lower head B has a very different orientation from A with respect to the microtubule, and moreover, its microtubule-binding loops face away from the microtubule. Indeed, even if we allow for other orientations, there is no physically reasonable way to move both heads into equivalent binding positions. The constraints are not only the different orientations of the heads, but also the position of the neck and the charge distribution. For example, rotating the dimer into the symmetric view of Figure 2B (similar to Figure 1 or Kull et al., 1996) would force the neck helix to poke into the microtubule surface. Turning this orientation around so that the neck would point away from the microtubule (i.e., toward the observer) would place kinesin's negative saddle (see Figure 4) against the microtubule's negative outside—again, an unlikely scenario. Further problems arise if we think of possible ways of attaching and detaching the head. Imagine, for example, that the lower head B in Figure 5B wanted to reorient and attach to the microtubule with its binding loops—it would first have to push the bound head A out of the way because its neck helix lies over that of B and clamps it down, as it were (this problem would disappear if the head-neck junction were flexible, see Tripet et al., 1997).

These conceptual problems would largely disappear if we dropped the models of motility that regard the two heads as equivalent, such as the walking model. The simplest way would be to view one of the heads simply as a backup structure rather than a motor. It might be important for processivity, helping the motor to stay on its microtubule track, but not for motility as such, in agreement with observations (Berliner et al., 1995; Inoue et al., 1997). This motion could be likened to limping, rather than walking (one head advancing, the other dragging behind). A single-headed mode of motility would be supported by the existence of monomeric kinesins that are capable of moving with normal speeds (Nanagaku et al., 1994). It would also agree with current models of myosin motility that are based on single heads (Holmes, 1997). A second possibility would be to invoke Hackney’s model, which explained the different nucleotide interactions of the heads in terms of alternating catalysis, with one head bound and the other free (Hackney, 1994; J iang et al., 1997). This model has been cited to explain the image reconstructions, but it runs into contradictions with the observed stoichiometries of kinesin-tubulin binding (see below). A third view is to postulate two distinct binding modes for the two heads, possibly combined with more complex models of motility such as rolling (Howard, 1996, patterned after the rotary model of the F1-ATPase, see Abrahams et al., 1994). The rotational symmetry of the kinesin dimer is suggestive in this regard, but thus far there is no structural evidence for distinct binding modes of kinesin heads on microtubules.

head somewhat, one would enable them to join into a coiled-coil. Such a whole-body rotation is unlikely because it would place the acidic side of the head against the acidic outside of tubulin (see Figure 4). It is conceivable, however, that the neck helices become flexible enough by themselves to rotate and join into a coiled-coil once the head is attached to the microtubule. But this poses the next problem: to advance along the microtubule, one head would have to take steps of at least 8 nm (depending on the model, see Block, 1995; Inoue et al., 1997). How could a head achieve this when it is tied down at the base? To solve this problem, one would

Figure 5. Models of Arrangements of Kinesin Heads on a Microtubule Surface

The tubulin subunits are shown as ellipses of height 4 nm and width 5 nm (α tubulin, black; β tubulin, blue); the microtubule axis is vertical. Kinesin ribbon diagrams were generated to scale and overlaid over the tubulin lattice in the background.

(A) shows three kinesin heads (black, green, and blue), which could be paired up hypothetically into dimers in three ways: side-by-side on neighboring protofilaments (black-green), one above the other on one protofilament (black-blue), or diagonally across two protofilaments (green-blue). The orientation of the heads is the same, that is, standard view as head A in Figure 2A so that the back surface (containing the conserved regions MT1 and MT2) faces toward the microtubule, and the neck runs tangentially to the left. Comparison with Figure 2 shows that none of these arrangements are compatible with the observed structure of the kinesin dimer. Linking two heads into a dimer could be achieved only if the neck helices were uncoiled.

(B) The two heads of a dimer shown in the standard view (as in Figure 2A; head A at the top is in the same orientation as in [A]).

(C) The two heads of a dimer are shown in the symmetric view to match the appearance of the image reconstructions (Hirose et al., 1996; Arnal et al., 1996). One head (top) points down in the 6 o'clock direction, and the other (bottom) up and to the right (angle 120°, about 2 o'clock direction); the neck helices point toward the observer. Notice that in this model, the microtubule-binding loops of kinesin do not face the microtubule.

Crystal Structure of Dimeric Kinesin
991

In considering the implications of the kinesin structure, one should also note two trivial explanations. One is that the observed arrangement of heads in a dimer is enforced by the packing in the crystal lattice. We believe that artifacts of the crystal packing can be largely ruled out because the monomeric and dimeric kinesin heads have rather similar structures, even though their packing constraints are quite different (data not shown). We have also considered the possibility that the heads might be sufficiently flexible to pair up with another neighbor in the crystal lattice such that it would fit onto a microtubule lattice; this case can, however, be ruled out as well. Another possibility is that the observed kinesin dimer does not bind to microtubules and represents a free, unbound state. We know from other studies (e.g., Thormählen et al., 1998) that kinesin dimers with bound ADP are fully capable to bind and decorate microtubules. It is conceivable, however, that there are changes in the conformation of heads and their arrangement in the dimer upon binding to the microtubule. As discussed above, in order to match the microtubule lattice, this would presumably involve a major rotation of the two heads and an opening-up of the neck helix. Although this question must remain undecided at present, one could ask where the link between the mechanochemistry and the structure might occur. The hydrolysis of ATP would presumably affect the rest of the structure via the regions switch I and switch II (equivalent to N2 and N3 in Figure 1), in analogy with myosin or the G proteins (Rayment, 1996; Vale, 1996). These regions are connected via β strands 6 and 7 to loop L10 (head B in Figure 2B, containing E221), which bridges over to loop L8b in the other subunit (head A, containing K160), near the putative microtubule interaction site MT1. The connection through the loops could possibly form, break, or change direction, depending on the bound nucleotide or on the microtubule interaction, and would thus represent an intersubunit switch.

Relationship between X-Ray Structure and Image Reconstructions of Kinesin

Over the past few years, several groups have applied electron microscopy and image reconstruction to analyze microtubule walls decorated with different constructs of kinesin or ncd (Harrison et al., 1993; Song and Mandelkow, 1993; Hirose et al., 1995; Hoenger et al., 1995; Kikkawa et al., 1995). There is general agreement that monomeric kinesin constructs (where there is no neck to induce dimerization) bind in equivalent positions, with one kinesin head per tubulin dimer. This agrees with the preferential binding of kinesin to β tubulin seen by chemical cross-linking (Song and Mandelkow, 1993). Dimeric constructs on microtubule walls have recently been analyzed as well (Arnal et al., 1996; Hirose et al., 1996). Both show two lobes of density. The major one (interpreted as a bound kinesin head) was near the ridge of a protofilament, similar to the monomeric kinesins. The minor one (interpreted as the second head in an unbound state) pointed up and to the right (microtubule viewed with its plus end up); the lower mass was ascribed to disorder in the free head. The two densities can be likened to the hands of a clock at 2:30,

with the major lobe axis down in the 6 o'clock direction and the minor lobe axis approximately in the 2 o'clock direction. The two lobes include an angle of ~110°, which is similar to the 120° angle between the heads in our symmetric view (Figure 2B). It is therefore tempting to position the kinesin dimer on the microtubule lattice in a corresponding orientation so that one generates the 2:30 appearance (Figure 5C). This could be done in only two ways. One could choose an orientation similar to Figure 2B but rotated in the plane so that head A points in the 2 o'clock direction and head B in the 6 o'clock direction. This would mean that the neck helices point into the microtubule wall—an unlikely case. Alternatively, one could turn Figure 2B over (as if viewed through the back of the page) so that the coiled-coil points toward the observer and then rotate it in the plane so that head A points down in the 6 o'clock direction and head B in the 2 o'clock direction as in Figure 5C. This would, however, place kinesin's and tubulin's negative surface (Figure 4) against one another—an equally unlikely choice. If we took this choice as the lesser evil, it would follow that head A is the bound head (in the interpretation of the image reconstructions), with its tip (best seen by the helical turn α0) pointing down toward the microtubule minus end, and the neck helix at the upper end. Since kinesin is a plus-end directed motor, it would mean that kinesin would move like a truck backing up, trailer first and engine behind. The second head B could be free, or it could interact with the neighboring protofilament for additional guidance.

The major caveat against this model is that it does not agree with the observed stoichiometry. The image reconstructions of the dimeric kinesin constructs suggest that there are two kinesin heads per tubulin dimer (one bound, one free), while our experiments with binding assays and STEM show only one head per dimer, the same as for monomeric kinesin constructs (Thormählen et al., 1998). It is not clear what the origin of the discrepancy is, but one should note that image reconstructions do not measure stoichiometries accurately, but rather rely on the interpretation of density distributions. It is possible, for example, that the minor lobe in the 2 o'clock direction corresponds only to the extra mass of the dimeric kinesin construct (the neck domain) and not to an entire head.

In conclusion, the structure of the kinesin dimer presented here provides us with a view of a dimeric motor protein, but does it explain motility? Thus far, the structure does not positively reinforce a particular model of motility, but rather confronts us with discrepancies between different experimental approaches and theories. In the analogous cases of myosin or G proteins, the structures of the partners, their interfaces and switching mechanisms are known (reviews, Hilgenfeld, 1995; Rayment, 1996; Vale, 1996; Holmes, 1997). The same information is needed here: in particular, the interaction site between kinesin and microtubules, the conformational switches associated with ATP hydrolysis, and the structure of tubulin itself. Given the structure we have at hand, the simplest explanation is that it represents a state of detachment or an intermediate state where only one of the heads is bound. For a walking model of motility, the coiled-coil of the neck would have to come apart,

protocol. The two molecules were not treated separately; strict non-
crystallographic symmetry was used instead. After a first run, the
3F<sub>o</sub>-2F<sub>c</sub> and F<sub>o</sub>-F<sub>c</sub> electron density maps were inspected with O
(Jones et al., 1991), and the model was rebuilt manually. Since not
all parts of the structure obeyed noncrystallographic symmetry, the
conditions where untightened and five more refinement cycles were
performed. Final refinement was performed using the maximum
likelihood approach implemented in the program REFMAC (Murshu-
dov et al., 1997). This yielded an R-value of 28.9% and R-free of
36.2%. This model included 5724 nonhydrogen atoms, including 2
ADP and 60 water molecules.

## Notes Added in Proof

The data referred to throughout as Sack et al., submitted, is now in press: Sack, S., Müller, J., Marx, A., Thormählen, M., Mandelkow, E.-M., Brady, S.T., and Mandelkow, E. (1997). X-ray structure of motor and neck domain from rat brain kinesin. Biochemistry 36, 16155–16165.

The structure was further refined using the developmental Crystallography and NME System program (CNS) by A.T. Brunger (personal communication). The atomic model was subjected to extended rebuilding, and several cycles of simulated annealing (5000 K) and overall anisotropic B-factor refinement. The current R factor is 21.0%, and the free R factor is 27.3% for all data in the resolution range 30.0–3.0 Å. The rms deviations from standard values of bond lengths and angles are 0.018 Å and 2.041°, respectively. Further refinement is in progress. The coordinates have been deposited in the Brookhaven Protein Data Bank with the accession code 3KIN.
