**Abstract** A cDNA of *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* encoding a plastidal homogentisate prenyltransferase was identified. Functional expression studies in *Escherichia coli* revealed that the enzyme possessed properties similar to the prenyltransferase of *Arabidopsis thaliana* encoded by At3g11950 but different from the phytyltransferases of *A. thaliana* and *Synechocystis*. Unlike the phytyltransferases, the *C. reinhardtii* and the respective *A. thaliana* enzyme showed highest activities with solanesyl diphosphate, but were hardly active with phytyl diphosphate. Hence, these data provide evidence that the latter represent homogentisate solanesyltransferases involved in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis. Overexpression of At3g11950 in *A. thaliana*, however, suggests that the solanesyltransferase can affect tocopherol biosynthesis as well.

### 1. Introduction

Plastoquinone-9 and tocochromanols are characteristic prenyllipids of cyanobacteria and plants, which both represent prenylated derivatives of homogentisate. Biochemical studies with isolated chloroplasts and subplastidal fractions showed that homogentisate prenyltransferases located in the inner envelope membranes of chloroplasts catalyze the first committed step in the biosynthesis pathways of plastoquinone-9 and tocochromanols [1–4]. These enzymes utilize homogentisate derived from the shikimate pathway and prenyl diphosphates synthesized via the plastidal non-mevalonate isoprenoid pathway as substrates and catalyze the decarboxylation and prenylation of homogentisate so that 2-methyl-6-prenyl-1,4-benzoquinols are formed. As shown in Fig. 1, prenylation with phytyl diphosphate (PDP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGDP) provides the precursor for the formation of tocochromanols, while prenylation with solanesyl diphosphate (SDP) results in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis.

Recently, genes encoding homogentisate prenyltransferases have been cloned from *Synechocystis* (*slr1736*), *Arabidopsis thaliana* (At2g18950 and At3g11950) and *Hordeum vulgare* (AY222860) and have been overexpressed in plants [5–9]. The analysis of the transgenic plants suggested that these genes encode enzymes involved in tocochromanol biosynthesis. With regard to At2g18950 (*VTE2*) and *slr1736*, this was supported by the analysis of the respective deletion mutants lacking tocopherols [10–12,5], and by the determination of the prenyl diphosphate specificities of the encoded enzymes expressed in *Escherichia coli* [5]. Hence, these data provided evidence that different distinct homogentisate prenyltransferases catalyze the prenylation reactions in the course of tocochromanol and plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis (Fig. 1).

In this report, we present the functional characterization of a *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* cDNA in comparison to the homogentisate prenyltransferase sequences of *A. thaliana* and *Synechocystis*. Our data reveal that the *C. reinhardtii* cDNA as well as the *A. thaliana* gene At3g11950 encode homogentisate prenyltransferases with properties different to those of the phytyltransferases from *A. thaliana* and *Synechocystis* and suggest that the first two are involved in plastoquinone-9 synthesis.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Construction of prenyltransferase expression vectors

A partial cDNA sequence from *C. reinhardtii* CC-1690 was amplified by PCR from cDNA libraries (Chlamydomonas Centre, <http://www.chlamy.org>) using the oligonucleotides AT(CT)GA(CT)AAG(AG)T(GCT)AACAAAGC or AT(ACT)GA(CT)AA(AG)(AG)T(AGCT)AA(CT)-AA(AG)CC in combination with GTA(AG)AA(GC)AG(GC)TTCCA-(AG)AT. PCR-based screening of the cDNA libraries resulted in the isolation of cDNA clones which encode a putative homogentisate prenyltransferase named CrHST (AM285678). The *A. thaliana* cDNA sequences *AtHPT* and *AtHST* corresponding to At2g18950 and At3g11950, respectively, were amplified from reverse transcription products of leaf mRNA from *A. thaliana* ecotype Columbia by PCR using the primer pairs GATGGAGTCTCTGCTCTCTAG/GTCA-CTCAAAAAAGGTAACAGC and ATGGAGCTCTCGATCTCA-CAATCAC/TCAGAAGGACATATCCTTGATGTATG, respectively. The open reading frame (ORF) *slr1736* (BA000022) encoding SynHPT was amplified from *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 genomic DNA by PCR with ATGGCAACTATCCAAGCTTTTGG and CTAAAAAATAGTATTAGAAAAATTAGG. PCR products were cloned using standard techniques and verified by sequencing.

For expression studies in *E. coli*, the full-length ORFs as well as those lacking the sequence for the putative plastidic transit peptide of 52 amino acids in CrHST, 37 in AtHPT and 69 in AtHST were

cloned into the Gateway vectors (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) pDEST14 and pDEST15 for the expression of the prenyltransferases as recombinant proteins with an N-terminal glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tag according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For plant expression, the *AtHST ORF* was linked on its 5′ end to double CaMV 35S promoter and on its 3′ end to the transcriptional termination sequence of the nopaline synthase gene and ligated into the *Bsp120I* site of the binary vector pRE1 (*AY456904*).

### 2.2. Expression in E. coli

Expression studies were carried out in *E. coli* BL21AI (Invitrogen). Cells harboring a pDEST construct were grown at 37 °C in LB medium supplemented with 50 μg ml⁻¹ carbenicillin. Expression was induced in exponentially growing cultures by adding L-arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2%. Cells were harvested 2 h after induction and used for the isolation of membranes as described before [13]. For Western Blot analysis, mouse GST-tag antibodies (Novagen, Schwalbach, Germany) and goat anti-mouse IgG-POD conjugate antibodies (Qiagen) were used with Lumi-Light plus (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

### 2.3. Enzyme assays

Prenyltransferase activities were measured by determining the incorporation rates of \[^{14}C\]homogentisate and prenyl diphosphates into lipophilic products. \[^{14}C\]homogentisate was synthesized enzymatically from \[^{14}C\]tyrosine (879 dpm/pmol, Hartmann Analytik, Braunschweig, Germany) as described in [14]. Unlabeled substrates were purchased from Sigma (Taufkirchen, Germany) and Biotrend (Köln, Germany), respectively.

*E. coli* membranes containing a homogentisate prenyltransferase were incubated in the following 100 μl standard reaction mixtures unless otherwise stated. Phytyltransferases were assayed in 50 mM Bis-Tris propane–HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM MgCl₂, 60 μM *n*-dodecyl-β-ᴅ-maltoside, 4 μM \[^{14}C\]homogentisate (781 dpm/pmol) and 10 μM PDP. CrHST and AtHST recombinant proteins were assayed in 50 mM TRICINE–NaOH pH 8.5, 20 mM MgCl₂, 100 μM \[^{14}C\]homogentisate (about 60 dpm/pmol) and 200 μM farnesyl diphosphate (FDP). After a 15–30 min incubation at 28 °C, lipids were extracted and analyzed on silica gel plates in dichloromethane. Labeled products were visualized with the bioimager FLA3000 (Raytest, Straubenhardt, Germany) and quantified by scintillation counting.

### 2.4. Identification of prenyllipids

Prenylation products derived from enzymatic assays were identified by co-chromatography with authentic prenyllipids or by GC/MS. To this end, 2-methyl-6-phytyl-1,4-benzoquinol (MPBQ) was synthesized according to Soll [15,16] while 2-methyl-6-solanesyl-1,4-benzoquinol (MSBQ) was extracted from *Iris hollandica* bulbs [17]. To verify the identity of 2-methyl-6-farnesyl-1,4-benzoquinol (MFBQ) and 2-methyl-6-geranylgeranyl-1,4-benzoquinol (MGGBQ), prenyllipids extracted from the enzymic reaction mixtures were reduced with NaBH₄ and separated by HPLC (Agilent 1100 series, Böblingen, Germany) on a EC250/4 Nucleosil 100-5 column (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) using 2% *tert*-butyl methyl ether in hexane at a flow rate of 1 ml min⁻¹. The collected HPLC fractions were dried under a stream of nitrogen and derivatized with 20 μl *N*-methyl-*N*-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide at 70 °C for 30 min and analyzed by GC/MS (Agilent GC 6890, 30 m 250 μm HP-5MS, oven: 2 min at 130 °C, from 130 °C to 300 °C at 5 °C min⁻¹, 10 min at 300 °C, helium flow: 1 ml min⁻¹, mass spectra: *m/z* 50–800).

### 2.5. Development and analysis of transgenic *A. thaliana* plants

Plants grown on soil at 21 °C, 16 h light/8 h dark cycle and under a light intensity of 120 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ were transformed with *Agrobacterium tumefaciens* C58C1 ATHV cells harboring the pRE1 derivative by the floral dip method [18]. Transforms were selected by kanamycin resistance and were grown under short day conditions (8 h light, 120 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹, 21 °C) in order to obtain well developed leaves. Successful gene transfer was confirmed by PCR using genomic DNA and specific primers for CaMV 35S promoter region and the *AtHST* coding region. Transgenic plants (*T₁*) with increased leaf prenyllipid levels were selfed and leaves of their progenies (*T₂*) cultivated under short day conditions were analyzed. Lipid extracts from 40 mg leaf material of 5–6 weeks old plants were subjected to HPLC as outlined for MFBQ and MGGBQ separation, but using 1.25% *tert*-butyl methyl ether in hexane. Fluorescence and UV signals were collected at 325 nm emission (290 nm excitation) and at 254 nm, respectively. Tocopherol and tocotrienol standards were purchased from Calbiochem (Merck Biosciences GmbH, Bad Soden, Germany) and Sigma. Plastoquinone-9 was extracted from spinach leaves using the MSBQ extraction protocol.

## 3. Results and discussion

### 3.1. Cloning and expression of homogentisate prenyltransferase genes

Screening of cDNA expression libraries from *Chlamydomonas reinhardtii* by PCR with degenerated primers deduced for characteristic motifs of prenyltransferases resulted in the identification of a cDNA encoding a polypeptide of 41.1 kDa termed CrHST. It was predicted to contain a chloroplast targeting sequence (ChloroP, [19]) and several putative membrane spanning domains (TMHMM Server v. 2.0, <http://www.cbs.dtu.dk>) suggesting that it represents a plastidic membrane protein. The deduced amino acid sequence shows significant similarity to homogentisate prenyltransferases from cyanobacteria and plants sharing higher sequence identity with the *Arabidopsis* protein (AtHST) encoded by *At3g11950* [9] than with the *Arabidopsis* phytyltransferase (AtHPT) encoded by *At2g18950* (VTE2, [5,6]).

To functionally characterize the enzyme encoded by the *C. reinhardtii* cDNA and to compare its properties with the homogentisate prenyltransferases of *A. thaliana* and *Synechocystis*, the respective sequences were cloned, the putative chloroplast targeting sequences were deleted and the resulting constructs named pCrΔHST (*C. reinhardtii* cDNA), pAtΔHPT (*A. thaliana* At2g18950), pAtΔHST (*A. thaliana* At3g11950) and pSynHPT (*Synechocystis* slr1736) were expressed in *E. coli*.

As described before, pSynHPT was functionally expressed in *E. coli* membranes and the enzyme catalyzed the formation of MPBQ from homogentisate and PDP [5,20]. On the other hand, the eukaryotic proteins, especially those of *A. thaliana*, were found to accumulate in distinctly lower levels in the bacterial membranes than SynHPT. This problem was partially overcome by expressing the eukaryotic prenyltransferases as GST-fusion proteins in *E. coli*. Western Blot analysis revealed that the fusion proteins of both the preprotein (GST-CrHST) and the mature one of *C. reinhardtii* (GST-CrΔHST) accumulated in appreciable levels in the membranes of the bacterial cells while the levels of the respective *A. thaliana* fusion proteins were about 10 times lower (data not shown).

a mature homogentisate prenyltransferase of *C. reinhardtii* or *A. thaliana* or a respective GST-fusion protein. These experiments revealed that only the membranes containing AtΔHPT or the respective GST-fusion protein (GST-AtΔHPT) possessed significant homogentisate phytyltransferase activity. These results were not altered when the incubation time was extended to 1 h and the assays were conducted with 10–20 times higher amounts of bacterial membranes.

The N-terminal GST fusion improved the phytyltransferase activity of AtΔHPT in the bacterial membranes from 20 to about 70 pmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein, but was found to have no obvious effect on its substrate specificities. The *A. thaliana* enzyme showed properties very similar to those of SynHPT (Fig. 2). Both enzymes were more active with PDP than with GGDP but inactive with SDP or FDP. The prenyl diphosphate specificity of the *A. thaliana* enzyme, however, was more pronounced than that of SynHPT. These data are in line with those of Collakova and DellaPenna [5], although the authors failed to detect the low GGDP dependent activity of the *A. thaliana* enzyme, presumably because of the very low activity of the plant enzyme reported by the authors.

### 3.2. Properties of SynHPT and AtHPT

To compare the properties of the homogentisate prenyltransferases from *Synechocystis*, *C. reinhardtii* and *A. thaliana*, we at first optimized the assay conditions with membrane fractions of *E. coli* cells expressing pSynHPT as enzyme source. Highest formation rates of MPBQ from labeled homogentisate and unlabeled PDP were obtained at pH 7.5. The SynHPT required divalent cations and showed highest activities at 2 mM MgCl₂, while stimulation with MnCl₂ or CoCl₂ was 5–10 times lower. Low concentrations of the non-ionic detergent n-dodecyl β-d-maltoside stimulated its activity more than twofold while concentrations higher than 100 μM caused a severe inhibition. SynHPT showed maximal activities at 4 μM homogentisate and 10 μM PDP (Fig. 2) and apparent \(K_m\) values of about 1 μM and 6 μM, respectively, were determined. Under optimized assay conditions the phytylation rates were constant for at least 15 min and 4 μg membrane protein, and specific activities of about 200 pmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein were measured.

Subsequently, the optimized assay conditions were used to analyze the membrane fractions of the *E. coli* cells containing

### 3.3. Properties of CrHST and AtHST

Unlike AtΔHPT and SynHPT, which were inactive with FDP, the prenyltransferase of *C. reinhardtii* effectively catalyzed the prenylation and decarboxylation of homogentisate, when PDP was substituted by FDP in the reaction mixture (Fig. 3A). These results were obtained not only with GST-CrΔHST but also with CrΔHST as well as with GST-AtΔHST. Hence, these data provide direct evidence that the cloned cDNA of *C. reinhardtii* encodes a homogentisate prenyltransferase and suggest that CrHST and AtHST represent a different group of homogentisate prenyltransferases than SynHPT and AtHPT. This was supported by the analysis of their enzymic properties predominantly conducted with *E. coli* membranes containing the most active GST-CrΔHST fusion protein. The enzyme displayed a more alkaline pH optimum than the phytyltransferases (Fig. 3B) and required tenfold higher MgCl₂ concentrations for optimal activity (Fig. 3C). The *C. reinhardtii* enzyme needed relatively high concentrations of both substrates for maximal activity (Fig. 4A and B) and possessed apparent \(K_m\) values of about 40 μM, which are distinctly higher than those of the phytyltransferases. With regard to the prenyl acceptor, the *C. reinhardtii* enzyme specified

ically used homogentisate and, to a lower extent, the respective lactone, presumably because the lactone was partially hydrolyzed under the assay conditions (Fig. 4C). In this regard, the *C. reinhardtii* enzyme did not differ from the *A. thaliana* phytyltransferase while the specificity of SynHPT was a bit more relaxed (data not shown). Under optimal conditions, the farnesylation rates were constant for 30 min and at least 50 μg membrane protein and specific activities of about 50 pmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein were determined.

When enzyme assays were conducted with membrane fractions of *E. coli* cells expressing a pAtHST construct, only the membranes containing a GST-fusion protein showed detectable homogentisate prenyltransferase activity of about 5 pmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹ protein. GST-AtΔHST showed properties very similar to those of GST-CrΔHST. It displayed the same substrate specificities as GST-CrΔHST with regard to both, the prenyl acceptor (Fig. 4C) and the prenyl donor (Fig. 5). The *A. thaliana* as well as the *C. reinhardtii* enzyme were more active with FDP than with GGDP, but hardly active with PDP

or SDP. The addition of 0.12 mM n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside to the reaction mixture, however, appreciably stimulated the SDP dependent activities, but hardly affected the FDP and GGDP dependent ones so that both enzymes displayed the highest activities with SDP (Fig. 5). The detergent most likely improved the solubility of the exogenously added very long chain prenyl donor and, thus, its accessibility towards the enzymes. According to the assays with GST-CrΔHST, n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside concentrations of up to 0.8 mM stimulated the SDP dependent activity further, but severely inhibited the activity with FDP and GGDP, so that the specificity for SDP became even more pronounced than that depicted in Fig. 5. Hence, these data suggest that CrHST and AtHST, unlike SynHPT and AtHPT, represent solanesyltransferases catalyzing the first step in plastoquinone-9 biosynthesis.

3.4. Overexpression of AtHST in A. thaliana

To provide evidence for the in vivo function of AtHST, its cDNA was constitutively overexpressed in *A. thaliana*. Trans-

as well which run up to 143% of the wild-type level predominantly due to an increase in α-tocopherol, the major tocochromanol in *A. thaliana* leaves. Seed specific overexpression of *AtHST* in *A. thaliana* has recently been reported to result in 1.4 times higher tocopherol levels in the seeds of the transformants than in the control seeds, but levels of plastoquinone-9 and its seed specific derivative plastochromanol-8 have not been shown [9]. In view of the fact that *A. thaliana* phytyltransferase mutants (*vte2*) lack tocopherols [10,11] and according to the prenyl diphosphate specificity of AtHST (Fig. 5), it appears unlikely that an increase in the tocopherol levels is a direct effect of *AtHST* overexpression. These results rather suggest that AtHST or its reaction product stimulates tocopherol synthesis via yet unknown control mechanisms. Indirect rather than direct effects have also been postulated with regard to the phenotype of the *A. thaliana pds2* mutant [21,5] lacking both plastoquinone-9 and tocopherol due to a still uncharacterized mutation that maps to the same location as At3g11950. Overexpression of *AtHST* in the *pds2* and *vte2* mutant of *A. thaliana* [10,11] will show whether this assumption is correct or whether the prenyl diphosphate specificity of AtHST can be altered under certain conditions as suggested for AtHPT [22].
