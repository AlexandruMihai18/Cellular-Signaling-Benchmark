**Rationale:** The peptide ligand apelin and its receptor APJ constitute a signaling pathway with numerous effects on the cardiovascular system, including cardiovascular development in model organisms such as xenopus and zebrafish.

**Objective:** This study aimed to characterize the embryonic lethal phenotype of the $Apj^{-/-}$ mice and to define the involved downstream signaling targets.

**Methods and Results:** We report the first characterization of the embryonic lethality of the $Apj^{-/-}$ mice. More than half of the expected $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos died in utero because of cardiovascular developmental defects. Those succumbing to early embryonic death had markedly deformed vasculature of the yolk sac and the embryo, as well as poorly looped hearts with aberrantly formed right ventricles and defective atrioventricular cushion formation. $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos surviving to later stages demonstrated incomplete vascular maturation because of a deficiency of vascular smooth muscle cells and impaired myocardial trabeculation and ventricular wall development. The molecular mechanism implicates a novel, noncanonical signaling pathway downstream of apelin-APJ involving Ga13, which induces histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 and HDAC5 phosphorylation and cytoplasmic translocation, resulting in activation of myocyte enhancer factor 2. $Apj^{-/-}$ mice have greater endocardial Hdac4 and Hdac5 nuclear localization and reduced expression of the myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) transcriptional target Krüppel-like factor 2. We identify a number of commonly shared transcriptional targets among apelin-APJ, Ga13, and MEF2 in endothelial cells, which are significantly decreased in the $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos and endothelial cells.

**Conclusions:** Our results demonstrate a novel role for apelin-APJ signaling as a potent regulator of endothelial MEF2 function in the developing cardiovascular system. (*Circ Res.* 2013;113:22-31.)

Various experimental approaches have indicated that the apelin-APJ pathway is a potent regulator of both cardiac and vascular functions.¹⁻⁴ The apelin (also known as APLN) ligand is translated as a 77-amino-acid pre-pro peptide and cleaved to shorter peptides that bind the G-protein–coupled receptor APJ (also known as AGTRL1/APLNR).⁵⁻⁶ Apelin is expressed primarily in the endothelium and acts both locally and in a paracrine manner to activate APJ.⁷⁻⁸ In the vasculature, studies support a vasodepressor role in both the arterial and venous circulation and suggest that these effects are mediated at least in part by nitric oxide.²⁻¹² Direct inotropic effects have also been demonstrated in isolated rodent hearts and cardiomyocytes.¹,¹³

Studies in developmental model organisms have suggested that the apelin-APJ pathway has a critical role in cardiovascular development. In vivo perturbation of apelin and APJ gene expression in xenopus was found to disrupt blood vessel development, and in vitro studies showed apelin to be a potent angiogenic factor and regulator of endothelial cell (EC) migration, cell division, and apoptosis.¹⁴⁻¹⁵ Previous studies have provided evidence that the apelin-APJ pathway modulates blood vessel size by regulating proliferation and assembly of vascular cells.¹⁶ Experiments in zebrafish found that apelin-APJ

3–7) were grown to 70% to 90% confluence. Transient transfections of plasmids were performed with Fugene HD (Promega) using the manufacturer's protocol. For gene silencing, small interfering RNAs (Stealth siRNA, Invitrogen) were transfected with RNAiMAX (Invitrogen) using the manufacturer's protocols.

### Statistical Analysis
All in vitro experiments (chromatin immunoprecipitation assays, immunoprecipitations, Western blots, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction [qPCR] assays) are representative of 3 independent experiments. Results are reported as mean ± SEM. An unpaired Student *t* test or 1-way ANOVA test was used as appropriate to determine statistical significance. Post hoc analysis was performed with the Bonferroni method. Values of *P* < 0.05 were considered significant.

### Results

#### Apj Deficiency Results in Incomplete Embryonic Lethality
Our previous findings, as well as *Apj* knockout (*Apj*⁻/⁻) mice generated by other groups, demonstrate a significantly decreased number of *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice that are born (although not discussed, we found the offspring genotype ratio of Ishida et al¹⁰ to be statistically significant by χ² test with *P* < 0.03).²⁰,²¹ Heterozygous *Apj*⁺/⁻ animals were fully viable and fertile. Mating of *Apj*⁺/⁻ mice resulted in a lower-than-expected number of *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice at the time of weaning (238 offspring studied, with 139 heterozygotes, 77 wild type, and 22 null mutants), reflecting statistically significant fewer *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice (χ², *P* = 1.05 × 10⁻⁷). Further embryonic evaluation demonstrated that lethality began at embryonic day (E) 10.5 and continued through to E12.5 (Table). Moreover, >20% of *Apj*⁻/⁻ pups died immediately after birth. Based on a 25% expected homozygous null mice, we saw only 9.2% a live *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice at the time of weaning. We did not observe any embryonic or postnatal death in the wild-type or the heterozygous mice.

#### *Apj*⁻/⁻ Embryos Have Vascular Defects
The *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos showed a spectrum of vascular deficits at early embryonic stages. Roughly 22% (7 of 32) of the surviving *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos at E10.5 had impaired maturation of the yolk sac vasculature, with a paucity of developed vascular structures (Figure 1A). Moreover, the same percentage (7 of 32) had anterior cardinal veins and dorsal aorta that either were lacking or were small and aberrantly located (Figure 1B). Staining of whole embryos (E9.5) with an anti-CD31 antibody suggested that ECs were present at a comparable level but contributed to vessels that were not formed appropriately (Online Figure I).

We further evaluated those embryos that survived to later stages (E12.5–E15.5). We found that the majority of those *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos surviving to these stages appeared grossly normal (Online Figure II), although a small number of dead *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos were also identified at E12.5 (Table). Despite the normal appearance, evaluation of their developing vessels demonstrated significantly decreased vascular smooth muscle cell layers surrounding the aortic endothelium, suggesting either delayed or defective vascular smooth muscle cell layer recruitment (Figure 1C).

### Methods
An expanded Methods section is available in the Online Data Supplement.

### Mice
All animal experiments were conducted with approval of the Yale University and Stanford University Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees. The global *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice were previously described.²¹ In brief, a single targeting construct was made containing the C57BL/6 *Apj* homology region, 3 LoxP sites, and the neomycin and diphtheria toxin genes. The construct was transfected into B6-3 embryonic stem cells and targeted embryonic stem cell clones transfected with pBS-Cre, and resulting clones found to have deleted both the neo and *Apj* genes were injected into C57BL/6J-Tyrc-2J blastocysts to establish the targeted allele fully in the C57BL/6 background.

### Cell Culture and Transfection
Mouse heart ECs were isolated by digesting whole hearts with collagenase (2 mg/mL) with gentle agitation for 45 minutes at 37°C. The cell suspension was triturated 12 times, filtered through 70-μm cell strainers, and then centrifuged at 400g for 5 minutes at 4°C. Cells were resuspended in 2 mL cold PBS with 0.1% BSA, and the cell suspension was incubated with Dynabeads (110.35-mouse, Invitrogen) coated with purified antibody to CD31 (553370 [mouse], 5 μL per 50 μL bead suspension, BD Pharmingen). We performed a second sorting step to ensure the purity of the ECs. Human umbilical vein ECs (HUVECs; Yale VBT Core) and COS7 cells (Lonza) were cultured at 37°C in a 5% CO₂ incubator. For HUVECs, growth medium was EGM-2 (Lonza) containing 2% fetal bovine serum. DMEM (Gibco) with 10% fetal bovine serum was used for COS7. For experimental treatments, HUVECs (passages

### Apj$^{-/-}$ Embryos Demonstrate Cardiac Developmental Defects

Dissection of embryos at E10.5 revealed that $\sim 19\%$ (6 of 32) of the surviving $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos had cardiac abnormalities, with the most severe mutants exhibiting enlarged and abnormally formed hearts that had not completed looping, with large pericardial effusions (Figure 2A, left and middle). In these embryos, there were no bulboventricular groove and no apparent demarcation of a bulbus cordis, with the outflow tract arising from the common ventricle and showing decreased mesenchymal formation. Formation of the atrioventricular cushion was delayed in all of the surviving $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos evaluated at this stage (Figure 2A, right). $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos surviving to the later stages (E12.5 and E15.5), despite their grossly normal size and appearance, were all found to have myocardial defects, including thinning of the myocardium (in all $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos evaluated) and a high prevalence of ventricular septal defects ($\sim 20\%$ of $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos; Figure 2B; Online Figure III). We also found significantly decreased proliferating cell nuclear antigen staining in the hearts of E12.5 $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos compared with wild-type littermates (Figure 2C). Moreover, we found in E15.5 $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos significantly decreased capillary densities compared with their wild-type littermates (Figure 2D). Finally, we also examined the hearts of $Apj^{-/-}$ mice surviving to adulthood. We found a number of various cardiac malformations, including enlarged right ventricles (4 of 10 $Apj^{-/-}$ mice) and ventricular septal defects (2 of 10 $Apj^{-/-}$ mice), which were not seen in wild-type or heterozygous littermates (Online Figure IV).

### Apelin-APJ Regulates Endothelial MEF2 Activation in a Gα13-Dependent Manner

On the basis of the observed embryonic lethal phenotype of the $Apj^{-/-}$ mice, we sought to investigate the downstream targets of apelin-APJ signaling in cardiovascular development. Previous analyses of $Apj$ expression in developing mouse, xenopus, and zebrafish embryos demonstrated that APJ is expressed predominantly in the endothelial layers of arteries and veins, as well as in the endocardial layer in the hearts, at E9.5 to E10.5. ${}^{15,25,26}$ We confirmed by in situ hybridization in E10.5 embryos that the predominant expression of $Apj$ was in the endocardium and ECs (data not shown). We previously demonstrated that apelin-APJ signaling regulates Krüppel-like factor 2 ($Klf2$) transcription. ${}^{4,27}$ In concurrence with these

data, Klf2 expression as detected by in situ hybridization was decreased in the endocardium of the heart and the endothelial layer of the aorta in E10.5 $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos (Figure 3A and 3B). Given the extent of evidence demonstrating the role of the MEF2 family of transcription factors regulating KLF2 transcription, ${}^{28-30}$ we addressed the hypothesis that apelin-APJ signaling induces MEF2 activation. We evaluated the effect of apelin-APJ on 3 MEF2 responsive luciferase constructs: (1) MEF2 luciferase reporter containing 3 tandem MEF2 binding sites (3X-MEF2); (2) a 221-bp promoter region of the KLF2 gene ${}^{31}$; and (3) a shorter, 41-bp promoter construct containing the minimal MEF2 binding site from the KLF2 promoter as previously described (Online Figure V). ${}^{30}$ We found that overexpression of MEF2A and MEF2C in COS7 cells resulted in a robust induction of the 3X-MEF2 luciferase reporter (Figure 3C). Overexpression of apelin and APJ in this context resulted in a greater induction of the 3X-MEF2 luciferase reporter activity (Figure 3C). Furthermore, overexpression of apelin and APJ in HUVECs induced luciferase reporter activity from all 3 MEF2 reporter constructs, including 2 derived from the KLF2 promoter (Figure 3D and 3E; Online Figure VI). APJ transfection alone was also able to significantly induce the 221-bp KLF2 promoter (Figure 3D). In addition, either mutagenesis of the MEF2 binding site or concurrent knockdown of MEF2A/C with apelin-APJ-transfection resulted in abrogation

of apelin-APJ induced MEF2 luciferase reporter activity (Figure 3D). To further assess whether apelin-APJ signaling can regulate MEF2 binding on the KLF2 promoter, we conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation assays. The level of MEF2 binding to the KLF2 promoter in HUVECs was markedly decreased by apelin-APJ knockdown (Figure 3F).

APJ has previously been found to signal through 2 G proteins, namely Gaq and Gai. ${}^{13,32}$ To evaluate whether apelin-APJ-mediated induction of MEF2 activity involves either of these G proteins, we overexpressed constitutively active forms of Gaq (Gaq-QL) and Gai (Gai-QL) with MEF2A, MEF2C, and the MEF2 luciferase reporter. We found no induction of the MEF2 reporter activity, suggesting that these G proteins were not involved in regulation of MEF2 activity (Figure 3C). Ga13, another member of the G protein family, has recently been described to target MEF2 but has not previously been associated with apelin-APJ signaling. ${}^{33}$ We found that constitutively active Ga13 can robustly induce MEF2 activity on the basis of all of the luciferase reporters tested in both COS7 cells (Figure 3C) and HUVECs (Figure 3E; Online Figure VI). We next evaluated whether Ga13 is a bona fide target of apelin-APJ signaling. Overexpression of APJ in COS7 cells was able to induce Ga13 activity as measured by guanosine-5'-triphosphate-γS bound-Ga13, which was further augmented by stimulation with the apelin 13 peptide (Figure 3G). Moreover, stimulation

of HUVECs with apelin 13 led to a robust increase in Gα13 activity, as assessed by immunoprecipitation of GTP-bound Gα13 (Figure 3H). Finally, transfection of HUVECs with increasing concentrations of APJ expression plasmid also led to increased Gα13 activity, suggesting an apelin-independent ability of APJ to activate Gα13 (Figure 3I).

**Apelin-APJ Activates MEF2 Activity Via Phosphorylation and Nuclear Export of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in ECs**

MEF2 is known to be regulated by multiple mechanisms, including class II HDAC-mediated inhibition.³⁴ We next evaluated whether apelin-APJ signaling-mediated regulation of MEF2 activity involves HDACs. Stimulation of HUVECs with apelin 13 led to a robust induction of HDAC4 and HDAC5 translocation to the cytoplasm from the nucleus (Figure 4A; Online Figure VII). Moreover, overexpression of APJ alone in HUVECs also induced translocation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 to the cytoplasm (Figure 4B).

In conjunction with the regulation of HDAC4/5 cellular localization, apelin and APJ overexpression in HUVECs resulted in a robust increase in HDAC4 and HDAC5 phosphorylation, which is known to be a critical step leading to their nuclear export (Figure 4C).³⁵ Apelin 13 stimulation was able to induce phosphorylation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in HUVECs, which was abrogated in the context of small interfering RNA-mediated APJ knockdown (Figure 4D). Moreover, APJ knockdown led to decreased HDAC4/5 phosphorylation at baseline. We further validated the role of Gα13 in this signaling cascade by demonstrating that knockdown of Gα13 in HUVECs abrogated the increased HDAC4/HDAC5 phosphorylation in response to APJ overexpression (Figure 4E). Moreover, concurrent overexpression of HDAC4 or HDAC5 with apelin and APJ in HUVECs led to inhibition of MEF2 transcriptional activity on the KLF2 promoter-driven luciferase reporter (Figure 4F).

**Increased Nuclear Localization of HDAC4 and HDAC5 in Apj⁻/⁻ Endocardium and ECs**

To further validate our in vitro signaling mechanism in our mouse model, we evaluated the localization of Hdac4 and Hdac5 in the Apj⁻/⁻ embryos. We found that the endocardial cells of E10.5 Apj⁻/⁻ embryos had a significantly higher percentage of cells with positive nuclear staining for Hdac4 and Hdac5 compared with wild-type littermates (Figure 5A).

We also evaluated the isolated heart ECs of Apj⁻/⁻ mice. We found in ECs isolated from wild-type mice a robust cytoplasmic translocation of both Hdac4 and Hdac5 in response to apelin 13 stimulation (Figure 5B). However, in ECs isolated from Apj⁻/⁻ hearts, we found that the percentage of ECs without nuclear Hdac4 and Hdac5 staining was significantly reduced at baseline and was not affected by apelin 13 stimulation. Moreover, we found decreased levels of phosphorylated Hdac4 and Hdac5 in heart ECs from Apj⁻/⁻ mice compared with their wild-type littermates (Figure 5C).

**Shared Transcriptional Targets of Apelin-APJ, Gα13, and MEF2 Are Decreased in Apj⁻/⁻ Embryos and ECs**

Given the preferential endothelial/endocardial expression of Apj in the developing embryo, we further pursued the endothelium-based relationship between apelin-APJ, Gα13, and MEF2 by conducting microarray analyses using HUVECs subjected to following knockdown conditions: (1) apelin and APJ, (2) Gα13, and (3) MEF2A and MEF2C (Online Figure VIII; GEO accession number GSE46825). We found a large number of genes that were similarly regulated in the 3 conditions, including a number of genes with known roles in cardiovascular development (Online Table I). We validated a subset of the downregulated genes by qPCR analyses (Figure 6A; Online Table II). We found that knockdown of APJ alone (without apelin) also resulted in decreased expression of these targets, although some transcripts were only minimally reduced (Figure 6A). To evaluate whether these downregulated genes were also similarly regulated in the Apj⁻/⁻ mice, we conducted qPCR analyses of E10.5 Apj⁻/⁻ embryos. The genes confirmed by qPCR analyses in HUVECs, including connexin 37 (CX37), connexin 40 (CX40), and vascular cell adhesion molecule-1, were also significantly downregulated in the Apj⁻/⁻ embryos (Figure 6B). Moreover, we conducted additional qPCR assays in isolated heart ECs from wild-type and Apj⁻/⁻ mice and found that the majority of these genes were also significantly downregulated (Figure 6C). With respect to Klfl2, we found in isolated heart ECs no difference in the baseline expression, likely because of the low basal level of expression in mature heart ECs that was detected; however, when these cells were stimulated with rosuvastatin (member

of HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor class of drugs, which are known to induce endothelial KLF2 expression),^{31,36,37} ECs from wild-type mice demonstrated a significant induction of Klf2, whereas ECs from $Apj^{-/-}$ mice failed to respond in a similar manner (Figure 6D).

To further validate these data, we evaluated the protein expression of 2 putative targets of this signaling axis: CX37 and CX40. HUVECs subjected to APJ knockdown expressed decreased levels of CX37 and CX40 as detected by Western blots (Figure 6E). Moreover, expression of Cx37 and Cx40 was decreased in the aortic endothelium of the E10.5 $Apj^{-/-}$ embryos (Figure 6F). We also found reduced expression of Cx37 and Cx40 in isolated heart ECs from $Apj^{-/-}$ mice compared with wild-type littermates (Figure 6G).

### Discussion

Here, we provide the first description of the cardiovascular developmental defects in $Apj^{-/-}$ mouse embryos. We identified a novel endothelial signaling cascade that originates from apelin-APJ and targets Gα13, resulting in HDAC4/5 cytoplasmic translocation and MEF2 activation. We validate this pathway in vivo by demonstrating increased nuclear localization

Figure 6. Shared targets of apelin-APJ, Gα13, and myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF2) in endothelial cells (ECs) are downregulated in *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos and isolated ECs. A, Knockdown of apelin/APJ, APJ, MEF2A/C, or Gα13 in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) leads to decreased mRNA expression of validated and putative MEF2 target genes. *P* < 0.05 for each knockdown condition vs control. B, Transcripts decreased in HUVECs subjected to apelin-APJ, APJ, MEF2A/C, or Gα13 knockdown are also significantly decreased in E10.5 *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos. *P* < 0.05 vs wild type (WT). C, Isolated heart ECs from *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice demonstrate decreased expression of gene transcripts identified from the microarray analyses. *P* < 0.05; **P** < 0.01; ***P** < 0.001.

of embryos in the homozygous *Apj*⁻/⁻ mouse model described here. Moreover, the zebrafish mutant phenotype was found to be a function of the genetic background, because different pairs of mutant carriers reproducibly yielded embryos with differing severities of phenotype. There are also anecdotal reports that the embryonic lethality of *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice is most severe when examined on specific inbred backgrounds. The observed incomplete penetrance is likely a result of stochastic activation of related pathways, which rescues heart and vascular development, and the observed alteration of this ratio by genetic background likely reflects differences in the ability of the compensatory pathways to be activated when apelin-APJ signaling is absent.

Our findings also suggest that both MEF2A and MEF2C are likely involved in apelin-APJ signaling on the basis of our mechanistic data and the variable phenotype of the *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice, some of which mimic the early embryonic lethality of the *Mef2c* null embryos (Figures 1A, 1B, and 2A)²²,²⁴ with others sharing the phenotype of the *Mef2a* null mice (Online Figure IV).²³

Three *Apln*⁻/⁻ mouse lines have been generated and reported in the literature.¹⁶,⁴³,⁴⁴ In each case, the *Apln*⁻/⁻ mice were found to be viable with Mendelian inheritance of the null allele. Because apelin is considered to be the only ligand for APJ and APJ to be the only receptor for apelin, the expectation is that the phenotype generated by functional deletion of the *Apln* and *Apj* genes should be very similar, if not identical. The likely explanation for differences in the *Apln* versus *Apj* null mice is that either a secondary ligand for APJ may exist, or a ligand-independent activation of APJ such as that recently described¹ may be contributing to the developmental context. Indeed, our findings suggest that induction of APJ alone, independently of apelin, may be capable of transducing the signals necessary for MEF2 activation. These findings will require additional investigation to delineate the role of apelin-dependent and apelin-independent signaling cascades that are downstream of the APJ receptor.

On the basis of the predominance of *Apj* expression in the endothelium and endocardium of the developing mouse

embryos,²⁵ we chose to focus on the downstream targets of apelin-APJ signaling in the ECs and identified MEF2 as a targeted transcription factor. Our work leaves open the possibility that apelin-APJ signaling in other cell types may also be important for proper cardiovascular development, especially in light of recent findings demonstrating the role of APJ signaling in myocardial progenitor cells in zebrafish.¹⁸,¹⁹,⁴⁵ Conditional, tissue-specific *Apj*-deficient mice are currently being generated and will help address these unresolved questions. Moreover, the role of apelin-independent activation of APJ in the context of cardiovascular development remains to be fully elucidated.

Our previous work had demonstrated that surviving adult *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice have a functional cardiovascular defect, and noninvasive imagining studies and isolated cardiomyocyte studies have shown that this is attributable, at least in part, to a primary defect in cardiac contraction.¹³,²¹ The presence of apelin in tissue and blood likely has a tonic effect on contractile function in adult mice.¹³,⁴⁶ However, our findings also suggest the possibility of congenital structural defects in some adult *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice that further impair their cardiovascular function. We have seen enlarged right ventricles and ventricular septal defects in adult *Apj*⁻/⁻ mice that could be contributing to the impaired exercise tolerance of these mice. These congenital defects are in keeping with types of developmental defects identified in the *Apj*⁻/⁻ embryos and likely represent survival of those animals with the less severe defects. These observations prompt human studies investigating the association of genetic variation in the *APLN* and *APJ* loci with congenital heart abnormalities.

## Novelty and Significance

### What Is Known?
- Embryonic development of the heart and blood vessels is a complex process that depends on the actions of various signaling pathways.
- G protein-coupled receptor signaling controls multiple aspects of both vascular and cardiac development.
- Mice with genetic deletion of the G protein-coupled receptor Apj display incomplete embryonic lethality.

### What New Information Does This Article Contribute?
- *Apj* knockout mice show numerous cardiac and vascular developmental abnormalities in utero.
- Apelin-APJ signaling targets the G protein Gα13, which results in cytoplasmic translocation of histone deacetylases (HDAC) 4 and HDAC 5 and myocyte enhancer factor 2 activation.

- We identify several novel endothelial targets of apelin-APJ signaling, including connexin 37 and connexin 40.
- Normal cardiovascular development requires a complex integration of various signaling processes. The molecular mechanisms that control this process remain incompletely understood. We show that systemic knockout of *Apj* in the mouse leads to cardiovascular developmental defects. We identify novel downstream targets of apelin-APJ signaling, including the G protein Gα13. Apelin-APJ signaling activates Gα13 and leads to robust cytoplasmic translocation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 and increases transcriptional activity of the transcription factor myocyte enhancer factor 2. These findings provide greater insights into the mechanisms of cellular signaling that regulate cardiovascular development.
