### ABSTRACT

Fat cell lipolysis, the cleavage of triglycerides and release of fatty acids and glycerol, evolved to enable survival during prolonged food deprivation but is paradoxically increased in obesity, in which a surfeit of all energy metabolites is found. Essential, previously-unsuspected components have been discovered in the lipolytic machinery, at the protective interface of the lipid droplet surface and in the signaling pathways that control lipolysis. At least two adipocyte lipases are important for controlling lipolysis, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL). Perilipin (PLIN) and possibly other proteins of the lipid droplet surface are master regulators of lipolysis, protecting or exposing the triglyceride core of the droplet to lipases. The prototypes for hormonal lipolytic control are beta adrenergic stimulation and suppression by insulin, both of which affect cyclic AMP levels and hence the protein kinase A-mediated phosphorylation of HSL and PLIN. Newly-recognized mediators of lipolysis include atrial natriuretic peptide, cyclic GMP, the ketone body 3-hydroxybutyrate, AMP kinase and mitogen-activated kinases. Lipolysis must be interpreted in its physiological context since similar rates of basal or stimulated lipolysis occur under different conditions and by different mechanisms. Age, sex, anatomical site, genotype and species differences are each important variables. Manipulation of lipolysis has therapeutic potential in several inborn errors and in the metabolic syndrome that frequently complicates obesity.

Lipolysis, the process by which fat cells degrade and release their content of triglycerides, is a potential therapeutic target for obesity, several inborn errors and other conditions in which lipid energy metabolism is important. Recent discoveries have markedly changed our concepts of the mechanisms of lipolysis. Research on lipolysis has been stimulated by the prevalence of obesity, which has reached unprecedented heights in children and adults. The increase in cardiovascular risk predicted from the current epidemic of pediatric obesity is looming as a major threat to world health.

### Physiological context

Lipolysis is best viewed in its physiological context, not as an isolated phenomenon. There are several lipolytic states. Prolonged fasting is characterized by an increased dependence on lipolysis for provision of fatty acids (FA)³ as an energy source, and by low circulating levels of insulin and catecholamines. In contrast, the lipolysis of acute stress is intense, brief and triggered by catecholamines. In obesity, body energy depots “overflow”, and the increased rate of lipolysis occurs in the context of high circulating levels of triglycerides (TG), glucose and insulin (Fig. 1). Cachexia, inflammation and many genetic, endocrine and nutritional diseases can affect lipolysis. There is an important distinction between “basal” lipolysis and that which is stimulated by hormones or other agents.

Three main organs produce and export FA: white adipose tissue (WAT), the intestine and the liver (Fig. 1). Intestine and liver esterify FAs prior to their release as TGs. Adipocytes release non-esterified (“free”) FA (FFA). In fact the term “free” is a misnomer because long chain FAs, which are cytotoxic, are avidly bound by proteins like albumin in the circulation and by fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) within cells.

Lipolysis is the first of three main control points in lipid energy metabolism. The others are located at carnitine palmitoyl transferase, which controls FA entry into mitochondria for beta oxidation, and hepatic mitochondrial 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl (HMG)-CoA synthase, which controls entry to the ketogenic pathway via HMG, which is essentially liver-specific [1] Fatty acids are major fuels for heart, skeletal muscle, kidney and liver. Ketone bodies from liver can be used in many extrahepatic tissues, including brain, a tissue from which most circulating FAs are effectively excluded [2].

Fig. 1. Lipid energy homeostasis. Adipocytes produce non-esterified FAs. The intestine and liver produce esterified FAs (TG) that circulate in chylomicrons and in very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), respectively. This simplified diagram does not illustrate many of the interactions among FAs, insulin and ketone bodies, nor their effects on glucose metabolism. For example, insulin suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis and stimulates glucose uptake in muscle. LPL, lipoprotein lipase.

In general, FA can contribute substantially to daily energy use, but the fraction of total body FA participating in intermediary metabolism at any time is tiny compared to the TG mass of WAT, even in individuals of normal weight. A modest energetic imbalance over time can predispose to obesity; conversely, fat loss by dieting is a slow process. To illustrate, consider fat energy metabolism in a sedentary non-obese 70 kg adult male (1.73 m² surface area) with ~13 kg of WAT and who in energetic equilibrium consumes ~2000 kcal daily. The following approximations ignore important variables like the use of non-lipid energy substrates, interindividual genetic variability in the efficiency of absorption and conversion of nutrients to energy, including neural influences on metabolic rate and the variety of physiological situations in which lipolysis can be activated or suppressed. With these provisos, it indicates an order of magnitude of changes that might result from therapeutic manipulation of lipolysis or oxidative fat metabolism. FAs provide ~9300 kcal (38.9 MJ) of energy per kg [3]; hence 1 kg of fat weight corresponds to the total energy expenditure of 4.6 days, or to 17 h of intense aerobic exercise like running (~600 kcal/h). Subtle but chronic imbalances may be important: if its energy content were stored as TG, the daily addition of a 5 g package of sugar (~20 kcal), would equate to a weight change of ~0.8 kg per year.

In the natural setting, the lipolytic phase of fasting follows the postprandial and glycogenolytic phases. It is progressively activated in adults after one or more days of fasting [2,4]. Lipolysis occurs earlier in fasting infants, who show ketosis after an overnight fast [5]. In a typical day, FA flux is greatest after an overnight fast. If lipolysis continued at this rate throughout the day it would result in the mobilization of ~160 g of FA per day (calculated as palmitate) of which about one-third would be oxidized and the rest would be reesterified into TG [6]. In fact, daily lipolytic flux is less than this. Lipolysis is suppressed by postprandial hyperinsulinemia, a situation that currently prevails during most of the day in North America. For instance in adults, an increase in plasma insulin of 4–5 μU/mL (29–36 pmol/L) causes a 50% decline of both FFA concentration and turnover [6]. Because of the large amount of stored TG and the lipolytic quiescence of adipocytes, the half-life of TGs in the WAT of human adults is long, measured between one and two years [7].

Lipolysis is a property of mature, differentiated adipocytes. Adipocyte maturation requires an elaborate sequence of events associated with specific patterns of transcription factors at different phases of differentiation [8]. Mature adipocytes have massive TG storage compared to any other tissue, despite having a well-developed lipolytic capacity. Conversely, a decrease of adipocyte differentiation, which by definition is associated with reduction of the lipid droplet volume, will transiently be accompanied by a net increase in lipolysis, and this is one potential mechanism for increasing lipolysis.

Some complications of obesity depend upon inter-individual variation in the tissue distribution of TGs (Fig. 1), which arise from genetic, physiological and nutritional factors. For example, adipocytes hypertrophied by TG accumulation have higher rates of basal lipolysis [9–12] and reduced production of adiponectin, an adipokine that contributes to good cardiovascular health when present at adequate levels. In other organs, accumulation of FA derivatives is felt to induce glucolipotoxicity, a toxic phenomenon currently under intense study [13a]. The circulating level of FAs is an independent cardiovascular risk factor [13b, 13c].

An important recent article has shown that fat cells turn over and are replenished throughout life [13d].

### Models for the study of adipocyte lipolysis

Lipolysis can be studied at the whole body, tissue, cell or biochemical levels [14–16]. To obtain an accurate view of any aspect of adipocyte physiology, studies at several levels of biological organization are required.

Measurement of plasma FFA under controlled conditions of nutrition or fasting is a useful first step, especially if large groups of subjects are available. Assessment of FA and glycerol fluxes by stable isotope studies is valuable but requires specialized equipment and a high level of expertise. Such methods assess whole body flux and can not distinguish among different organs as sites of production or consumption of these metabolites.

Techniques applicable to intact adipose tissues include microdialysis in living subjects [15,17] and studies in adipose explants. These techniques have the advantage of preserving local interactions between adipocytes and their surrounding stroma.

Cellular models permit the study in isolation of intrinsic adipocyte processes. The seminal work of Rodbell [18] described the isolation of mature white adipocytes by collagenase digestion. Isolated adipocytes are fragile and typically survive only a few hours after isolation. An excellent recent review summarizes the technical issues involved in assessing lipolysis in isolated adipocytes [19], emphasizing the importance of standardized gentle isolation, maintenance of cell density during incubation, and of coincubation with adenosine. Adipocyte hypertrophy, which accompanies most types of obesity, is an important variable independent of external regulators of lipolysis. Lipolysis can be expressed in different fashions: by cell number, cell surface area or cell mass. Adipocyte hypertrophy results in increased levels of lipolysis when expressed per cell but decreased levels when expressed as calculated cell TG content; the effect of hypertrophy is minimized by normalizing lipolysis to calculated cell surface area [11,12]. The sensitivity of lipolysis measurements has been enhanced by the use of luminometry for glycerol release [20], allowing several determinations to be performed with cells isolated for
example from small biopsies or from a single mouse. Methods for measurement of FA release currently require more cells than this; for studies in mice, pooling of adipocytes from several animals may be necessary.

A popular *in vitro* model system uses differentiation into adipocytes of immortalized fibroblast lines like 3T3-L1 and 3T3-F442A, derived from Swiss mouse embryos [21]. Incubation of these cells in a differentiation cocktail containing 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX, a phosphodiesterase inhibitor), dexamethasone and insulin [8], endows them with many morphological and physiological properties of mature adipocytes. Cells can survive for days in this state and conditions requiring several days to develop can therefore be studied. Preadipocytes isolated from WAT of humans or experimental animals and mouse embryonal fibroblasts (MEFs) [22] can also be differentiated into adipocytes. There are important differences between such cells and isolated primary adipocytes. Adipocytes differentiated *in vitro* have never experienced the normal interaction with stromal cells or the normal in vivo humoral environment. Also, even at their most differentiated state, *in vitro*-differentiated cells have multiple vesicles and a lower TG content than do mature adipocytes.

Elegant biochemical studies have been performed with purified lipases involved in adipocyte lipolysis. These enzymes act at the interface between the cytoplasm and the lipid droplet, a unique environment that is difficult to reproduce *in vitro* and at which a community of proteins is now recognized to be critical for lipolysis (see below). This must be recalled in interpreting the results of *in vitro* studies of isolated proteins in aqueous environments, since the properties of the enzyme in this environment may differ from those at the lipid droplet surface.

Studies in model organisms form a vital area of research. The mouse is the best-studied genetic model (Table 1) and the rat and even non-mammals like *Drosophila* [23] provide intriguing data. Constitutive gene targeting is pertinent for the study of in-born errors but may produce complex phenotypes in which the role of adipocyte lipolysis is difficult to deduce specifically: genes implicated in lipolysis may “moonlight” by playing physiologically-unrelated roles in other tissues [24]. Adipocyte-specific expression or gene targeting is a popular technique, using the aP2 promoter [25]. Of note, in addition to its reliable strong expression in white and brown adipocytes, moderate aP2 expression in macrophages [26] can induce Cre recombinase-mediated gene targeting in these cells as well.

Population-based studies of the association between genetic variants and adipocyte phenotypes like obesity are increasingly being published.

### The lipolytic apparatus: lipases

#### Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)

HSL (Table 2) was long considered to be the exclusive modulator of TG and diglyceride lipolysis. It can cleave fatty acyl esters of various compounds, including cholesterol, steroids and retinoic acid as well as glycerol. HSL has greater affinity towards diacylglycerols (DGs) than towards TGs or monoacylglycerols (MG) [27]. It can be phosphorylated on at least five serine residues, of which four are associated with lipolytic activation and one, S554 in human HSL, with reduced lipolytic activity [28]. The action of HSL is enhanced by the presence of aP2, the FABP of adipocytes [29] (Fig. 2), with which it interacts directly [29,30]. Activation of HSL is associated with its displacement to the surface of the lipid droplet [31,32] (Fig. 3).

HSL-deficient mice also demonstrate that HSL is essential for normal adipose tissue structure and function (Table 1). In the absence of HSL, WAT mass is reduced, the response to beta-adrenergic agonists is reduced, circulating FA level is low, the DG content of WAT is markedly increased [33] and on a high-fat diet, increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1), which normally is a characteristic protein of brown adipose tissue [34]. Basal lipolysis is paradoxically increased and fasting lipolysis is normal [20]. Adipocytes are hypertrophied and many lipid-filled macrophages are present [20,35]. Macrophage infiltration of WAT, a frequent finding in obesity of various causes [26], is particularly intense in HSL deficiency [35]. HSL-deficient mice have many pathological changes in non-adipose tissues (Table 1). Administration of a specific inhibitor of HSL diminishes the plasma level of FFAs in mice, rats and dogs [36], suggesting a greater role for HSL in basal lipolysis *in vivo* than is observed in non-stimulated isolated adipocytes.

#### Adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL)

This lipase was reported independently by three groups and is also known as desnutrin, iPLA₂ζ and TTS-2.2 [37–39]. Atgl−/− mice (Table 1) are obese. ATGL has been implicated in both basal and beta-adrenergic stimulated lipolysis [37]. ATGL mutations can cause a lipid myopathy in humans (Table 1). The first reported human ATGL mutations conserved the active site of ATGL [40], but recently a clinically severely affected patient was reported who was homozygous for a severe premature truncation mutation [41]. The adipocyte phenotype of these patients has not been described and the clinical spectrum of ATGL deficiency in humans is unknown. Thiazolidinedione treatment increases the expression of ATGL [42]. Together, HSL and ATGL can explain the great majority of adipocyte lipolysis; in WAT from Atgl−/− mice, pharmacological inhibition of HSL reduces lipolysis to 2% of normal [43].

CGI-58 (ABHD5, Table 2, Fig. 3), a lipid droplet surface protein that is deficient in Chanarin–Dorfman syndrome (neutral lipid storage disease, MIM 275630), may interact directly with ATGL [43] and perilipin [32,44]. An important role for CGI-58 in lipolysis is strongly suggested by the neutral lipid storage seen in Chanarin–Dorfman syndrome patients.

#### Other lipases: the triglyceride hydrolases (TGH and TGH2) and monoglyceride hydrolase

TGH accounts for a major fraction of TG hydrolase activity in cytoplasmic fractions from mouse WAT [46]. This 60 kDa protein of the endoplasmic reticulum lumen is encoded by the mouse Ces3 gene (confusingly designated CES1 in humans, Table 2). It is found in a cluster of paralogous genes. One parologue, present in the mouse but apparently not in the human genome, is TGH-2. TGH-2 increases lipolysis when overexpressed [47a]. Suppression of TGH expression in NIH-3T3 cells has been reported to decrease lipolysis [47b]. Since ATGL and HSL together can mediate the major fraction of lipolysis (see preceding section), present evidence is against a major direct physiological role in lipolysis for either TGH. However, direct study of their role in adipocytes has not been reported.

A monoglyceride hydrolase [45], constitutively expressed in adipose tissues, is felt to be abundant and not rate limiting.

### The lipolytic apparatus: the lipid droplet surface

Adipocyte differentiation is a sequential process with an elaborate developmental program [8]. Cells express characteristic sets of proteins at each state of differentiation: multipotent precursor cells, preadipocytes and mature adipocytes. Only mature adipocytes possess the complete apparatus for lipolysis and triglyceride synthesis and for adipokine production.

The lipid droplet undergoes a sequence of biochemical and morphological changes during the maturation of NIH-3T3 cells into adipocytes. A series of lipid droplet surface proteins of the PAT family (perilipin, adipophilin, TIP47) is seen: first TIP47, S3-12 and adipophilin on small peripheral droplets, then adipophilin and S3-12 and finally perilipin (PLIN), the principal protein of large central mature lipid droplets. Catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis is associated with phosphorylation of PLIN and with its presence on the surface of the central lipid droplet. PLIN is the main effector of protein kinase A-stimulated lipolysis. It interacts with HSL and with CGI-58, regulating the access of HSL to TGs [48]; the mechanism by which the interaction with CGI-58 influences lipolysis is unknown. Plin−/− mice show a high rate of basal lipolysis but are resistant to beta-adrenergic stimulation of lipolysis and are lean [49].

Physiologically, adrenergic stimulation creates small PLIN-covered droplets in cultured adipocytes [50]. The anticipated effect

Fig. 3. Lipolysis and lipogenesis in adipocytes. The lipolytic apparatus is shown, highlighting the three components of lipolysis: access to substrate, TG hydrolysis and FA recycling. For simplicity, PLIN is the only protein shown at the lipid droplet surface and FATPs are depicted as cell membrane proteins, whereas their distribution may be intracellular [65]. Cycling between lipolysis and lipogenesis requires energy for the synthesis of acyl-CoA synthesis. Recycling of glycerol by glycerokinase is a minor pathway in adipocytes. DGAT, diacylglycerol:acyl CoA acyltransferase; GK, glycerokinase; GPAT, glycerol phosphate:acyl-CoA acyltransferase; MG, monoglycerides; MGAT, monoglyceride:acyl-CoA acyltransferase; MGL, MG lipase.
of this is an increase of the total surface area of lipid droplets exposed to cytoplasmic lipases. This may represent a non-enzymatic strategy for enhancing lipolysis.

The lipid droplet surface proteome is complex [51], and includes molecules of transport and intracellular signaling as well as those directly involved with TG hydrolysis. With the caveat that some hydrophobic molecules may copurify with lipid droplets as an artefact due to their hydrophobicity, this observation is consistent with a role of these proteins in lipid droplet biology and metabolism (Fig. 3) [52].

Similar accumulations of cytoplasmic TGs occur in other cell types. Although they are quantitatively less than the content of mature adipocytes, they are potentially important for many complications of obesity. Beta cells, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle and possibly hypothalamus are possible targets. We speculate, it is possible that knowledge of LD formation in adipocytes may be helpful in understanding droplet accumulation and lipotoxicity in extra-WAT locations.

### Triglyceride synthesis

Triglyceride synthesis (Fig. 2) is active in WAT and is a determining factor for both adipose tissue mass and for the net liberation of FAs from adipose tissue. In fasting rats, for example, 57% of hydrolyzed FAs are recycled into TG synthesis [53]. This pathway may be influenced by the supply of FA-CoAs, of glycerol phosphate precursors, or by the activity of enzymes at later stages of TG synthesis.

Most FAs that are stored as TGs in adipose tissue are derived from the diet, but 1–5% are synthesized in liver and 1–2% in adipose tissue itself [54]. FAs are released from VLDL or chylomicrons by intravascular hydrolysis of lipoprotein TGs by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) on the endothelial surface. In WAT, LPL activity is cyclic, being highest after meals, when the plasma lipoprotein TG concentration is highest, and lowest during fasting [55,56]. FA capture is nearly complete in muscle but is variable in WAT, also depending on time after meals [57]. Non-uptake of FA after intravascular TG hydrolysis may explain intriguing observations such as the presence of a measurable or even an elevated level of FFA in the plasma of mice with no detectable fat tissue [58].

The mechanisms of FA entry into and release from adipocytes are controversial and full discussion would exceed the scope of this review. Briefly, FAs can rapidly traverse lipid bilayers, leading some investigators to question the importance of protein-mediated FA transport [59,60]. However, direct observation of FA entry to cells suggest a slower rate than predicted *in vitro*, favoring an important role for protein-mediated transport (reviewed in [61–63]). Adipocyte proteins implicated in FA transport include CD-36, fatty acid transport proteins (FATPs) and structural proteins like caveolin. FATPs 1 and 4 are the main FATPs of adipose tissue but are expressed in many tissues [64]. FATPs have acyl CoA synthetase activity, and it has been suggested that the increase of cellular FA uptake that is observed following overexpression of FATPs may reflect their increased rate of “trapping” as CoA esters; alternatively, FA entry to cells and fatty acyl-CoA synthesis may be coupled processes and if so, disruption of acyl-CoA synthetase activity could directly block FA entry (reviewed in [65]). The properties and substrate specificities of FATPs differ from those of acyl CoA synthetase 1 (ACS1) [66], which also is present in adipocytes. For instance, FATPs have maximal acyl-CoA synthetase activity towards very long chain fatty acids.

Blood flow in WAT is important for both lipolysis and lipogenesis. The direction and rate of FA bulk flow across the adipocyte cell membrane is determined by the gradient between the extracellular and intracellular concentrations of FFA. An increase of local circulation can increase the gradient by enhancing FA removal. Circulation in WAT may be a determining factor for FA release, particularly during exercise [67]. A related factor is the affinity and transport capacity of albumin for FAs.

The complete lipogenic pathway exists in human WAT. In humans, the capacity of *de novo* FA synthesis, measured in excised omental fat, is 5-fold less than that of rats [68], perhaps because of the low levels of a key transcriptional activator, SREBP-1, in human WAT [69]. Although lipogenesis accounts for only a small fraction of total TG flux, its importance in the determination of WAT mass has not been resolved.

Availability of glycerol phosphate is another determinant of TG synthesis. Glycerol phosphate can arise in many fashions in WAT. Glucose is the main source (Fig. 2). WAT has low levels of glycerokinase (Fig. 2), and hence has a low capacity to recycle the glycerol produced by lipolysis. A technical consequence of this situation is that TG hydrolysis can be accurately assessed by measurement of glycerol production by adipocytes. There are exceptions to this rule. Mice deficient in the cell surface glycerol transporter aquaporin 7 have high glycerokinase activity, adipocyte hypertrophy and obesity (Table 1) [70]. Also, treatment with thiazolidindiones, which is associated with the production of increased numbers of small adipocytes and with decreased cardiovascular risk, also increases glycerokinase activity [71]. Glyceroneogenesis [72] is another source of glycerol phosphate, and mice with transgenic overexpression of phospho-enol pyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), the key enzyme of glyceroneogenesis, are obese [73].

DGAT catalyses the final step of lipogenesis. The two isoforms, DGAT1 and 2, are produced by different genes that share no homology. Inactivation of either of these genes results in lean mice that otherwise have very different phenotypes (Table 1).

### Endocrine and paracrine regulation of lipolysis

Several molecules can affect the rate of adipocyte lipolysis (Fig. 4). Cyclic AMP (cAMP) stimulates protein kinase A, which in turn phosphorylates HSL and PLIN, activating lipolysis [74a]. Insulin and catecholamines exert opposing effects on lipolysis via this system. Catecholamine binding to beta adrenergic receptors activates stimulatory G (Gs) proteins, producing cAMP. Conversely, insulin stimulates phosphodiesterase 3B, which reduces levels of cAMP (Fig. 5).

Catecholaminergic innervation from the sympathetic nervous system is an important determinant of lipolysis [74b]. In a dog model, ~40% of the FA output of visceral fat under basal conditions is supplied by β-adrenergic-dependent pulses [74c].

In primates but not in rodents, natriuretic peptides stimulate lipolysis, by production of cyclic GMP, which results in phosphorylation and activation of HSL and PLIN and is particularly important for exercise-induced lipolysis [75].

Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, produced by adipocytes and by macrophages, stimulates lipolysis [76]. The concentration of TNF-α in WAT is elevated in obesity. TNF-α binds its membrane receptor TNFR1, and activates the downstream MAP kinases p44/42 and JNK. Stimulation of lipolysis by TNF-α is slow, prolonged and requires neither HSL nor ATGL. It confers a “dedifferentiated” expression pattern to adipocytes, decreasing the total PLIN level and increasing the fraction of PLIN that is phosphorylated. TNF-α also suppresses insulin signaling, by diminishing PDE-3B activity.

Interesting recent observations include the discovery that β3 adrenergic receptors stimulate lipolysis in part by a cAMP-independent pathway involving Src kinase, MKK1/2 and ERK [77]. Also, PPARγ agonists stimulate both lipolysis and lipogenesis, resulting in an increased rate of futile FA cycling [42]. Even leptin is mildly lipolytic in rodent adipocytes [78] and to a lesser extent in human adipocytes [79].

Fig. 4. Lipid droplet dynamics. The lipid droplet is the most imposing feature of adipocytes. It is calculated to occupy 92% of cell volume in small mature adipocytes and 99% in hypertrophied adipocytes [118]. Many aspects of its synthesis and degradation remain unknown. Small droplets are thought to arise from the endoplasmic reticulum (A) and to fuse (B) with the central droplet (C), composed mainly of TGs but also is a major reservoir of other lipophilic compounds like cholesterol and some toxins [119,120]. Lipolysis involves structural and metabolic changes, including fragmentation of the central droplet (D) and translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet surface, depending on activation by PKA-mediated phosphorylation (E). The roles of other lipid droplet surface proteins including CGI-58, discussed in the text, are also drawing much interest. ER, endoplasmic reticulum.

Fig. 5. Metabolic control of lipolysis and of related pathways. This figure combines features from rodent and human cells, at different physiological conditions and ages; no adipocyte is known to possess all of these features at one time. Several signaling pathways converge upon PLIN and HSL. Their architecture suggests points of control that may be important. Transporters, for instance, determine the levels of substrates and products within the cell. For example, insulin stimulates the transport of the GLUT4 receptor to the adipocyte cell membrane, which increases glucose uptake and hence the supply of phosphoglycerol for lipogenesis. The multiple effects of these compounds on transcription are not detailed here because of space constraints. Abbreviations used: AC, adenylate cyclase; AP7, aquaporin 7; Adr, adrenergic; PG, prostaglandin; PKG, cyclic GMP-dependent protein kinase; R, receptor.

Receptors coupled to inhibitory G proteins suppress lipolysis. The most studied of these are the α2A adrenergic receptors. The relative importance of β- and α-adrenergic effects in human fat depots varies with age [80], adipose mass [81], WAT location and sex [74a]. Adenosine, which is produced by WAT, inhibits lipolysis [74a]. Nicotinic acid, a clinically-useful hypolipidemic agent, suppresses lipolysis by the receptor designated HM74a in humans [82]. The ketone body, 3-hydroxybutyrate (3HB) also binds to this receptor. As the final product of beta oxidation and ketogenesis,

3HB may mediate a type of negative feedback. The physiological importance of suppression of lipolysis by adenosine or by 3HB remains to be determined.

Potentially conflicting reports have been published regarding AMP kinase (AMPK) and lipolysis [83,84]. One article reports phosphorylation of the HSL residue equivalent to S554 in humans and inhibition of the displacement of HSL to the lipid droplet surface and inhibition of lipolysis [83]. Conversely, lipolytic stimuli that increase cAMP also are associated with phosphorylation of AMPK

residue T182, known to activate AMPK, and expression of a dominant negative AMPK mutant decreased isoproterenol-stimulated lipolysis [84].

### Species, physiologic, anatomic and developmental influences

The properties of adipocytes *in situ* depend on their species of origin, developmental history, anatomical site and upon local physiological demands. The following examples illustrate these diverse influences upon lipolysis.

In contrast to mice, “typical” human adipocytes possess α2A adrenergic receptors and natriuretic peptide receptors, and some have receptors for thyrotropin. Conversely, human adipocytes have a negligible β3 adrenergic response [85], in contrast to the great importance of this receptor in rodent adipocytes. Growth hormone provokes intense lipolysis in mice but has little or no effect in humans [74,86]. In rodents, differences between deep and subcutaneous lipid deposits are less marked than in humans [74a].

Fasting lipolysis is normal in HSL deficiency [20] and even in mice in which all β-adrenergic receptors are absent [87], illustrating the importance of HSL- and catecholamine-independent pathways of lipolysis.

Moderate aerobic exercise increases lipolysis [67]. Mechanisms for this include enhanced sensitivity to catecholamines, reduction of plasma insulin levels and local effects with selective activation of lipolysis in fat depots closest to the active muscles [88] as well as atrial natriuretic hormone-stimulated cyclic GMP-mediated effects [75].

The control of lipolysis differs across the life cycle. Some of the mechanisms for this are known. During the first weeks of postnatal human life, thyrotropin is the main lipolytic hormone [89]. In newborns [80] and in the elderly [90], β-adrenergic lipolysis is opposed by a strong α-adrenergic effect. Adipocyte size increases throughout early life. The mean adipocyte volume in humans increases 2.5-fold in the first 6–12 months of life, and 1.5-fold between 6–12 months and young adulthood [89]. Obesity can result in a further 2-fold increase [91]. Assuming that adipocytes are spherical, and taking extreme examples, there is a 400-fold difference between the volume of adipocytes with diameters of 20 μm, which can be found in the WAT of children, and those with a diameter of 150 μm, which are not uncommon in WAT of obese individuals.

There are important differences between intraabdominal and subcutaneous WAT depots. About 80% of WAT is subcutaneous. At the same body mass index, women on average have a greater subcutaneous fat mass and a higher level of plasma FFA than men [74a]. In subcutaneous WAT, basal lipolysis and the sensitivity to suppression of FFA production are greater than in intraabdominal fat but the sensitivity of lipolysis to catecholamine stimulation is reduced [74a]. Mesenteric fat releases lipolysis-derived FAs directly into the portal vein, in proportion to the volume of abdominal WAT [92], and can influence the insulin sensitivity of hepatic gluconeogenesis [93]. Abdominal obesity confers a higher cardiovascular risk than does a similar fat mass in a subcutaneous location [94]. Similar site-specific characteristics are seen in rats [95].

physiological importance under extreme conditions that are rare in technologically advanced societies with abundant and constant food supply. Furthermore, with the possible exceptions of lipodystrophy and morbid obesity, fat tissue rarely inspires intense diagnostic enthusiasm in physicians, surgeons or pathologists. Even if an inborn error involving one of the lipolytic proteins caused no acute or morphologically severe change, the chronic metabolic consequences of this state might be important for cardiovascular health. The phenotypes of genetically-modified mice (Table 1) provide a general reference point for clinicians alert for new hereditary diseases of lipid energy metabolism, although the possibility of major interspecific differences must be kept in mind.

### The therapeutic potential for manipulation of lipolysis

Manipulation of lipolysis may have therapeutic potential. As an important component in the network of lipid energy metabolism, adipocyte lipolysis is positioned to affect the fat content of liver, muscle, heart and kidney (Fig. 1) in obesity, disorders of ketogenesis, ketolysis and of fatty acid oxidation, mitochondrial diseases, glycogen storage diseases and other inborn errors. Lipolytic stimulation could be helpful in epilepsy and in inborn errors of metabolism treated by a ketogenic diet. Suppression of lipolysis might be therapeutically useful in several inborn errors of fatty acid oxidation and ketone body metabolism.

Changes in lipolysis might shift the balance of FA flux and modulate fat mass. Arguably, this could change the risk of complications in diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Some monogenic conditions involving the components of the lipolytic/lipogenic apparatus in humans and/or mice (Table 1) and also common genetic variants of these genes, do have changes in parameters related to metabolic syndrome [74,96,97]. Furthermore, adipocytes derived from obese subjects [98] and even from non-obese relatives of obese patients [76], have been found to have a reduced lipolytic capacity. The benefits and risks of modulating a single component of this complex system remain to be explored, with vigilance for possible unpredicted effects at sites remote from adipose tissues.
