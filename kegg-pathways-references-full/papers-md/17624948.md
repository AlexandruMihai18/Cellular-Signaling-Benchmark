Summary: Leukocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is an integrin that is critical for T-cell adhesion and immunologic responses. As a transmembrane receptor and adhesion molecule, LFA-1 signals bidirectionally, whereby information about extracellular ligands is passed outside-in while cellular activation is transmitted inside-out to the adhesive ectodomain. Here, we review the role of small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) in LFA-1 signaling. Rap1, a Ras-related GTPase, appears to be central to LFA-1 function. Rap1 is regulated by receptor signaling [e.g. T-cell receptor (TCR), CD28, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4 (CTLA-4)] and by adapter proteins [e.g. adhesion and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP) and Src kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa (SKAP-55)]. Inside-out signaling flows through Rap1 to regulator of adhesion and cell polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues (RAPL) and Rap1-GTP interacting adapter molecule (RIAM) that act in conjunction with the cytoskeleton on the cytosolic domain of LFA-1 to increase adhesion of the ectodomain. Outside-in signaling also relies on small GTPases such as Rho proteins. Vav-1, a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Rho proteins, is activated as a consequence of LFA-1 engagement. Jun-activating binding protein-1 (JAB-1) and cytohesin-1 have been implicated as possible outside-in signaling intermediates. We have recently shown that Ras is also downstream of LFA-1 engagement: LFA-1 signaling through phospholipase D (PLD) to RasGRP1 was required for Ras activation on the plasma membrane following stimulation of TCR.

Introduction  

Leukocyte-function-associated antigen-1 (LFA-1) is an integrin that is important for lymphocyte adhesion to endothelium, T-cell priming, and delivery of help and cytotoxic activity via immune synapses (1–9). It has long been appreciated that integrin activity is regulated by the activation status of platelets and leukocytes (10–14). The idea of integrins stimulating intracellular signaling events derives from studies of T cells that showed that engagement of integrins by specific antibodies induced signaling (15–20). These observations have merged into the consensus that LFA-1 and other integrins signal bidirectionally (21).

Inside-out signaling refers to the process by which cellular activation results in augmentation of the adhesive properties
of the ectodomain of the integrin. The classic mediator of  
this process is inducible interactions between the cytosolic  
C-termini of the α and β chains and the cytoskeletal protein  
talin (10, 21). The pathways linking cellular activation to  
talin-mediated integrin activation have been established in  
model systems as protein kinase C (PKC) to Rap1 to Rap1-  
guanosine triphosphate (GTP) interacting adapter molecule  
(RIAM) to talin (10). Rap1 is a small G-protein, which has  
also been implicated in regulation of integrins in lympho-  
cytes (22). Circulating T cells are continually exposed to  
LFA-1 ligands on the vasculature, and their ligand-binding  
activity must be maintained at a very low level in resting  
cells but be rapidly activated in the appropriate vascular bed  
to arrest rapidly moving cells (23). The prominent role of  
both small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) and closely  
associated heterotrimeric G-proteins in this process, both  
widely utilized switches in biology, is consistent with the  
rapid response required.

The concept of integrins serving as outside-in signaling  
receptors is gaining credence. Outside-in signaling refers to the  
process by which engagement of an integrin by its adhesive  
ligand transmits signals through the integrin that influences  
intracellular signaling events. These signals have often been  
detected in the presence of other receptor systems, such as  
growth factor receptors or the T-cell receptor (TCR), and thus  
it was often unclear whether integrins only amplified signals  
from these receptors or generated unique signals. The identi-  
fication of specific signaling pathways that are activated only  
when integrins are engaged has led to the conclusion that  
integrins are signaling receptors (24). Recent studies have  
identified intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), a mem-  
ber of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, as a cell surface  
ligand that binds LFA-1 and triggers signaling events (24, 25).  
Such signaling may be reciprocal, as there is evidence that  
ICAM-1 can also transmit a signal into antigen-presenting cells  
(APCs) (6). With regard to the outside-in signaling through  
LFA-1, the molecular mechanisms remain obscure, although  
Jun-activating binding protein-1 (JAB-1) and cytohesin-1 have  
been implicated as possible signaling intermediates (24, 25).

In this review, we discuss the role of the small G-protein Rap1  
and several members of the Rho family as well as cytohesin-1 in  
LFA-1 activation and adhesion, from the perspective of both  
inside-out and outside-in signaling. We also discuss studies  
characterizing the role of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen-4  
(CTLA-4) in LFA-1-mediated adhesion. We conclude with  
recent data that may clarify the mechanisms by which two  
different receptors, LFA-1 and TCR, cooperate to activate Ras at  
the plasma membrane (PM).

The role of GTPases in inside-out signaling

Rap1 and its role in adhesion  
Rap1 is a member of the Ras superfamily of GTPases that is  
highly expressed in T lymphocytes. Rap1 is closely related to  
Ras, and the effector domain sequences of the two GTPases  
are identical (26). Rap1, like Ras, undergoes GTP/guanosine  
diphosphate (GDP) exchange in response to various growth  
factors and regulates mitogen-associated protein kinase (MAPK)  
cascades. Rap1 was first identified as an antagonist for Ras (27).  
Active Rap1 can bind but not activate Raf-1, and thereby, Rap1  
may sequester Raf-1 from the Ras/extracellular signal-regulated  
kinase (Erk) pathway. This aspect of Rap1 signaling has been  
proposed to mediate some of the anti-proliferative actions of  
Rap1 in T cells and underlines the role of Rap1 in anergy (28).  
The anergic phenotype can be mimicked by overexpressing an  
activated mutant of Rap1 (29). TCR activation of Rap1 is  
inhibited by CD28 and activated by CTLA-4 (30). This finding is  
interesting because other TCR downstream effectors, includ-  
ing Ras, are enhanced by CD28 (31). It has been suggested that  
CD28 induces Rap1-GTPase-activating protein (GAP) activity.  
CTLA-4, in contrast to CD28, inhibits T-cell activation  
including that regulated by the Erk pathway (32). Recent  
studies have demonstrated that Rap1 mediates the inhibition  
of Erk by CTLA-4 (30). Another pathway through which Rap1  
can antagonize Ras function in T cells is the suppression of Ras-  
dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) (33). Finally, p38  
activation by interleukin (IL)-1, characterized as Ras depen-  
dent, is antagonized by Rap1 (34). Despite these observations,  
the idea of Ras antagonism by Rap1 remains controversial.  
Several reports showed that Rap1 could actually synergize with  
Ras signaling and activate Erk (35). One mechanism evokes the  
observation that Rap1 binds B-Raf that can activate Erk. Rap1  
activation of Erk through integrins has been also reported.  
Engagement of integrins by adhesive ligands can trigger Erk  
activation. We observed no inhibitory effect on Erk activation  
following overexpression of activated Rap1V12 (unpublished  
observation).

Growth control is but one of a variety of processes in which  
Rap1 has been implicated. For instance, the Rap1 guanine  
nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Epac2 [exchange protein  
directly activated by cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)]  
has been linked to cAMP-regulated exocytosis, implicating Rap1  
in the control of vesicular trafficking (36). Another example of  
the regulation by Rap1 of vesicular traffic is the regulation of  
AMPA receptors on postsynaptic neurons (37). In the lymphoid  
lineage, Rap1 promotes production of CD4+CD103+ regulatory  
T cells (38). Overall, the best characterized function for Rap1 is  

Immunological Reviews 218/2007   115  the modulation of integrin-mediated adhesion (39). In human
leukocyte adhesion deficiency type III, a defect in Rap1 activation
is responsible for the defect in adhesiveness, offering compelling
evidence for a physiological relevance for Rap1 control of
integrin function (40).

Intracellular cAMP regulates cell adhesion through the
activation of Rap1. The activation of Rap1 by cAMP can occur
via PKA-dependent and PKA-independent mechanisms (41).
PKA-independent activation is mediated by direct binding of
cAMP to Epacs (whereas Epac1 is ubiquitous and is expressed in
lymphocytes and Epac2 is undetectable in all hematopoietic cell
types) (42). In addition to adhesion, cAMP regulates chemotaxis,
also through the activation of Epac1 (43). Interestingly,
whereas Epac1 activates a perinuclear pool of Rap1 and does not
activate Erk, Epac1 artificially targeted to the PM (Epac1-CAAX)
results in Erk activation (41). Crk Src homology 3 (SH3) domain
guanine nucleotide exchanger (C3G) was the first Rap1-GEF
identified, and it is targeted to the PM upon activation.
Activation of Rap1 by C3G also results in the activation of Erk
(44). The ability of Rap1 to activate Erk depends on which
Rap1-GEF is utilized. The distinct localization of C3G and Epac1
suggests that each GEF activates a separate pool of Rap1 and that
these pools differentially couple to the Erk pathway. Thus, like
Ras (45, 46), Rap1 is regulated by compartmentalized signaling.

The localization of Rap1 in T cells is not as well defined as in
epithelial cells. Using green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion
proteins and live cell imaging, we observed GFP-Rap1 on the
PM as well as on cytoplasmic vesicles (47). Rap1 has been
reported on endosomes, and indeed, vesicles marked by GFP-
Rap1 incorporated Texas-red-conjugated transferrin. We have
also found that the guanine nucleotide-binding state of Rap1
influences its subcellular localization. Whereas the GTP-bound
form (Rap1V12) displayed steady-state localization indistinguishable from that of the wildtype, the nucleotide-free form
(Rap1N17) was observed only on cytoplasmic vesicles (47).
The intracellular vesicles decorated by GFP-Rap1V12 and GFP-
Rap1N17 were also marked with transferrin, consistent with an
endosomal compartment. These data suggest that whereas the
guanine nucleotide-binding state of Rap1 does not regulate
association with endosomes, only the GTP-bound form of the
protein associates with the PM.

The localization of Rap1 on both PM and endosomes raised
the possibility that Rap1 might traffic between these compartments by vesicular transport (endocytosis/exocytosis). Consistent with this model, we observed an upregulation of
PM-associated GFP-Rap1 when COS-1 cells were stimulated
with epidermal growth factor (EGF) (47). The rapidity of this
response suggested translocation from intracellular vesicles, and

indeed, pretreatment of cells with a pharmacological agent that
blocks vesicular fusion at the PM, N-ethylmaleimide (NEM),
blocked EGF-stimulated upregulation of Rap1 on the PM.
Manipulating proteins that regulate endosomal traffic validated this result. Dominant-negative Rab11-binding protein
(Rab11BP) inhibited EGF-stimulated upregulation of GFP-Rap1
at the PM, confirming regulation of PM-associated Rap1
expression by endosomal recycling. In myeloid cells, Rap1 is
present on secondary and tertiary granules that are rapidly
mobilized by inflammatory agonists to fuse with the PM and
thereby discharging their luminal contents to the extracellular
space and to add their complement of membrane-associated
proteins to the PM (48). Also, in primary myeloid cells, Rap1 is
associated with vesicular compartments that serve as pools of
membrane that can be rapidly mobilized to the cell surface (49).
Thus, in both fibroblasts and hematopoietic cells, Rap1 expression at the PM can be rapidly upregulated by exocytosis.

We have shown that the Ras-binding domain (RBD) of Raf-1
tagged with GFP can report where and when Ras is activated in
living cells (50). We developed an analogous probe specific for
Rap1, using the RBD of RalGDS, an effector that has a higher
affinity for Rap1 than for Ras (47). When expressed alone, GFP-
RBD$_{\text{RalGDS}}$ had a homogeneous distribution in the cytosol.
When coexpressed with wildtype Rap1, GFP-RBD$_{\text{RalGDS}}$ accumulated on PM in peripheral ruffles. The differential membrane localization of GFP-Rap1 (PM and endosomes) versus
GFP-RBD$_{\text{RalGDS}}$ (PM only) was striking, suggesting that the
GTP-bound pool of Rap1 is limited to the PM. NEM or
dominant-negative Rab11BP blocked EGF-stimulated recruitment of GFP-RBD$_{\text{RalGDS}}$ to the PM, suggesting that activation of
Rap1 on this compartment requires exocytosis. In contrast,
inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis with dominant-
negative epsin had no effect. The fact that both upregulation and
GTP/GDP exchange of Rap1 on PM required exocytosis
suggested that the two processes were linked. Exocytosis to
the leading edge of the cell, where extending lamellipodia
require rapid expansion of the surface membrane, is a well-
established paradigm in cell biology and one that may explain
the appearance of GFP-Rap1 in ruffles (51). Moreover, the
preferential upregulation of Rap1 in membrane ruffles suggests
that the GTPase may play a role in actin-mediated processes such
as cell motility and adhesion.

Among the best characterized functions of Rap1 in T cells is
the regulation of LFA-1-mediated adhesion. Sustained TCR
signaling is required for proliferation and cytokine production.
LFA-1 plays a pivotal role in facilitating sustained T cell–APC
adhesion by promoting prolonged contact between T cells
and APCs. One-hundred-fold more antigens were required for

T-cell activation in the absence of LFA-1 (2). Additionally, in B cells, the LFA-1–ICAM-1 interaction lowered the threshold for activation (52). The active form of Rap1 was shown to induce (inside-out) changes in both conformation and affinity of LFA-1. Dominant-negative Rap1 blocked TCR-mediated LFA-1 activation, suggesting that Rap1 activation was required for inside-out signaling for LFA-1 activation (29). Moreover, T cells from Rap1-deficient mice have a diminished adhesive capacity to both ICAM-1 and fibronectin. Katagiri et al. (29) reported that Rap1 was activated in T cells in an antigen-dependent manner and accumulated at the contact site between T cells and antigen-loaded APCs. Inhibition of Rap1 abrogated LFA-1-ICAM-1-mediated adhesion to antigen-pulsed APCs and subsequent IL-2 production by the T cells. Overexpression of Rap1 enhanced these responses to a degree where it promoted activation-induced cell death. High levels of Rap1 activation could also suppress IL-2 production and induce an anergic state. Therefore, the level of expression of Rap1 has a decisive effect on the T-cell response to antigen.

What is the subcellular localization of Rap1 in T cells? We found that resting Jurkat cells exhibited a mixed population of two distinct patterns of GFP-Rap1 expression: whereas all the cells expressed GFP-Rap1 on endomembrane, only a minority of cells expressed the protein on the PM (47). Both the wildtype and the GTP-bound (Rap1V12) forms were observed on both compartments, whereas the nucleotide-free (Rap1N17) form was expressed predominantly on intracellular membranes. After stimulation of the TCR, a condition shown to activate Rap1, the majority of cells exhibited a distribution of GFP-Rap1 on both endomembrane and PM. Despite robust expression of wildtype GFP-Rap1 on intracellular membranes, GFP-RBD<sub>RalGDS</sub> was recruited in Jurkat cells coexpressing wild-type Rap1 exclusively to the PM (Fig. 1), indicating that, like in epithelial cells, the GTP-bound pool of Rap1 is limited to the PM.

We confirmed that overexpression of wildtype Rap1 augmented the ability of Jurkat cells to adhere to fibronectin and also showed that expression of GTP-bound Rap1V12 had an even greater effect. Coexpression of Rab11BP markedly inhibited wildtype Rap1-stimulated adhesion of Jurkat cells. To assess the role of Rap1 and endosomal recycling in a system where the TCR stimulates inside-out signaling to LFA-1, we studied adhesion to ICAM-1-coated surfaces. As shown previously, TCR stimulation by cross-linking CD3 markedly stimulated ICAM-1 mediated adhesion (47). Whereas overexpression of wildtype Rap1 augmented adhesion, expression of dominant-negative Rap1N17 inhibited TCR-stimulated adhesion. Importantly, dominant-negative Rab11BP also inhibited this process, while inhibition of clathrin-mediated

**Fig. 1. Spatial regulation of N-Ras and Rap1 in lymphocytes.**

Whereas N-Ras is expressed on the PM and Golgi apparatus of Jurkat T cells (panel A, left), Rap1 is expressed on the PM, nuclear envelope, and intracellular vesicles (panel B, left). A fluorescent probe that reports by translocation the location of GTP-bound Ras, GFP-RBD<sub>Raf-1</sub> (panel A, right), reveals activated Ras on the PM (arrow) and Golgi (arrowhead) in cells plated on ICAM-1 and stimulated by cross-linking the antigen receptor (TCR). In contrast, a fluorescent probe specific for GTP-bound Rap1, GFP-RBD<sub>RalGDS</sub>, reports activated Rap1 only on the PM (arrow).

endocytosis had no effect. Because Rap1-mediated adhesion was blocked by inhibition of exocytosis, we concluded that endosomal recycling is required for this process.

Further evidence that supports a functional role for Rap1 at the PM comes from Katagiri et al. (53). In lymphoid cells, these authors identified a novel effector of Rap1, regulator for cell adhesion and polarization enriched in lymphoid tissues (RAPL), also called Nore1b. This protein associated with the cytoplasmic tail of LFA-1 after stimulation of the TCR. Overexpression of RAPL augmented LFA-1-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1 and a dominant-negative RAPL mutant inhibited adhesion. In RAPL-stimulated lymphocytes, LFA-1 redistributed to the leading edge, resulting in enhanced adhesion to ICAM-1. Stimulated by active Rap1 (GTP bound), RAPL associated with LFA-1 and rapidly accumulated at the immune synapse, elucidating a molecular mechanism of inside-out signaling mediated by Rap1. In a recent work, Katagiri et al. (54) used the yeast two-hybrid system to identify molecules associated with an activated form of RAPL. These investigators

Mor et al · Small GTPases and LFA-1 signaling

found that the kinase Mst1 interacted with activated RAPL. RAPL regulated the localization and kinase activity of Mst1. Knockdown of Mst1 revealed its requirement for LFA-1 clustering and adhesion. Both RAPL and Mst1 localized to vesicular compartments and dynamically translocated with LFA-1 to the leading edge upon Rap1 activation, suggesting a regulatory function for the RAPL-Mst1 complex in intracellular transport of LFA-1.

Additionally, Rap1 has been implicated in the regulation of integrin-mediated adhesion in lymphoid cells downstream of the TCR and of CD31 (platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule) (55). CD31 is an integrin adhesion amplifier that propagates signals that induce T-cell adhesion via LFA-1 and very late antigen-4 (VLA-4). CD31 ligation stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of its cytoplasmic tail, leading to association with several proteins including phospholipase (PLC)-γ1. Reedquist et al. (55) reported that CD31 activated Rap1 and that Rap1 was a critical mediator for CD31-increased adhesion. CD98, an early marker of T-cell activation, is an important regulator of integrin-mediated adhesion events. Rap1 is also required for CD98-induced adhesion of LFA-1 (56).

Members of the PKC family of serine-threonine kinases are critical for integrin activation. PKC inhibitors block TCR-mediated integrin activation. Medeiros et al. (57) have recently shown that PM targeting and activation of Rap1 depend on PKD1 (also known as PKCμ), a serine-threonine kinase that is a downstream effector of PKC. The activation of Rap1 by PKD1 does not depend on the enzymatic activity of PKD1 but involves an interaction between the pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PKD1 and Rap1. PKD1 lacking the PH domain blocks TCR-mediated activation and clustering of β1 integrins. The PH domain of PKD1 is important for both Rap1 activation and membrane translocation in T cells. The PKD1-Rap1 complex needs to bind to the cytoplasmic tail of the β1 subunit of integrins to facilitate adhesion. Han et al. (10) studied the integrin activation complex in platelets. They reported that inhibition of Rap1 reduced integrin activation, whereas activated Rap1V12 bypassed the requirement for PKC, establishing that Rap1 is downstream of PKC (10).

Divalent cations, such as Mg²⁺, Mn²⁺, and Ca²⁺, and certain anti-LFA antibodies have been shown to induce an increase in integrin adhesiveness (58, 59). Mn²⁺ does not induce accumulation of Rap1 at the PM, consistent with the notion that it bypasses intracellular signaling events and directly affects the adhesive properties of the integrin ectodomain. However, de Bruyn et al. (59) showed that Rap1 is required for Mn²⁺- and for antibody-induced LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion. Inhibition of Rap1 by either RapGAP or RalGDS-RBD abolished both

Mn²⁺-and anti-LFA-1-induced adhesion to ICAM-1. These observations suggest that the action of Rap1 on the cytosolic domain of LFA-1 is permissive for the direct actions of Mn²⁺ or specific antibodies on the ectodomain.

If the notion that Rap1 antagonizes the Ras/Erk pathway essential for T-cell activation is correct and physiologically relevant, this presents a paradox. It is clear that Rap1 positively regulates T-cell adhesion, which is also essential for function. One model that might reconcile these findings would be differential signaling outputs from different subcellular compartments. For example, Rap1 associated with the PM might enhance LFA-1-mediated adhesion, thereby promoting T-cell activation, whereas Rap1 associated with intracellular vesicles might antagonize the Ras/MAPK pathway.

Adapter proteins and inside-out signaling

More than 20 integrin-binding proteins have been identified. Among these is talin (60), a well-defined component in LFA-1 regulation that is not discussed in detail in this review. Also among integrin-binding molecules are a few adapter proteins. Linker for activated T cells (LAT), Src homology 2 (SH2) domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76), adhesion- and degranulation-promoting adapter protein (ADAP), and Src-kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa (SKAP55) are adapter proteins that have been proposed to be directly involved in LFA-1 activation (61–64). Analysis of ADAP-deficient mice revealed a role for ADAP in regulating TCR-stimulated LFA-1 adhesion. In T cells, ADAP is associated with SKAP55. Similar to ADAP, SKAP55 is capable of enhancing TCR-stimulated activation of integrins and formation of conjugates between TCR and integrins (65). After silencing of SKAP55 by short interfering RNA, LFA-1 activation and clustering was impaired, as was TCR-mediated adhesion to ICAM-1. Disruption of ADAP-SKAP55 complex leads to displacement of Rap1 from the PM without influencing its GTPase activity. These findings suggest that the ADAP-SKAP55 complex regulates TCR-mediated integrin activation through PM targeting of Rap1. Interestingly, membrane targeting of the ADAP-SKAP55 module induces T-cell adhesion, even in the absence of TCR stimulation (65).

Lafuente et al. (66) identified RIAM, a Rap1-interacting adapter protein, as a regulator of integrin activation. RIAM is required for Rap1-induced adhesion and controls Rap1 localization to the PM (67). As expected, RIAM knockdown resulted in impaired Rap1 translocation to the PM. RIAM interacted exclusively with the active form of Rap1. When expressed in Jurkat T cells, RIAM induced cell spreading and

118 Immunological Reviews 218/2007

increased β1 and β2 integrin-mediated adhesion (42). Unlike RAPL that functions by binding directly to Rap1 and integrins, RIAM functions through an interaction with actin-regulatory proteins. Direct interaction between RAPL and RIAM has not been established.

The final step in integrin activation is the binding of talin to the cytoplasmic domains of integrin β subunits (49). Han et al. (10) studied this pathway using Chinese hamster ovary cells in which the authors reconstructed an agonist-induced activation system for αIIbβ3, a prototype for platelet integrins. Rap1 induced the formation of integrin activation complexes containing RIAM and talin. This was followed by the final common step in integrin activation: unmasking the integrin-binding site in talin. Talin binding to integrins mediates Rap1-induced activation because Rap1V12 failed to activate αIIbβ3 in cells expressing binding-defective talin. PKC agonists such as phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) are well known activators of integrins. In the same study, Han et al. (10) showed that Rap1 was downstream of PKC in the activation of the integrin αIIbβ3. Rap1V12 bypassed the requirement for PKC, suggesting that the kinase is upstream of Rap1.

AF6 (ALL1 fused gene from chromosome 6), also known as afadin binds to several small GTPases and is thought to be an effector of both Ras and Rap1 (68). AF6 controls cell junction formation in a Ras-dependent manner (69). Knockdown of AF6 in T cells enhanced Rap1-induced, integrin-mediated adhesion, whereas overexpression had the opposite effect (70). Interestingly, AF6-induced inhibition of cell adhesion correlated with an increase in Rap1-GTP levels (71). AF6 is therefore a negative regulator of Rap-induced adhesion that may function by sequestering Rap1-GTP in an unproductive complex and thus prevent the interaction with other downstream regulators.

CTLA-4 and its role in adhesion

CTLA-4, also known as CD152, was initially identified in a subtractive hybridization screen for cytotoxic genes (72). CTLA-4 is an activation-induced homodimeric glycoprotein receptor on T cells that interacts with B7-1 (CD80) or B7-2 (CD86) ligands on the surface of APCs (73). When engaged by B7, CTLA-4 plays a role as a negative regulator of T-cell activation and leads to downregulation of T-cell responses and to the preservation of T-cell homeostasis and peripheral tolerance. The mechanism of T-cell inactivation by CTLA-4 involves antagonism of CD28-dependent costimulation (CTLA-4 binds B7-1 and B7-2 with greater affinity than does CD28) and direct negative signaling via its cytoplasmic tail. A B7-independent function for CTLA-4 has also been proposed based on the presence of a ligand-independent variant of CTLA-4

that has been linked to resistance to autoimmune diabetes (73). The pathways involved in direct CTLA-4 signaling remain uncertain.

Gatta et al. (74) elucidated one signaling pathway involving CTLA-4. In this study, CTLA-4 was shown to inhibit signals derived from integrins. These authors showed that CTLA-4 engagement inhibited IL-2 production, not only when TCRs were costimulated with antiCD3/CD28 antibodies but also when costimulated by LFA-1. CTLA-4 was also found to directly affect LFA-1 signaling. LFA-1 has been reported to induce Ca²⁺ mobilization in the absence of TCR stimulation. In this study, CTLA-4 engagement negatively regulated LFA-1-induced Ca²⁺ mobilization.

In a recent study, CTLA-4 engagement was reported to upregulate LFA-1 adhesion while at the same time inhibiting IL-2 production (75). TCR-induced LFA-1 function was dependent on CTLA-4 expression, as CTLA-4-null T cells demonstrated reduced adhesion. In another report, the same group studied the influence of CTLA-4 on integrin-dependent motility (76). Using in vitro migration assays and in vivo two-photon microscopy, they showed that CTLA-4 increases T-cell motility and overrides the TCR-induced stop signal required for stable conjugate formation between the T cell and the APC. CTLA-4-null T cells slow down and form much longer lasting conjugates with APCs. Increases in motility led to a reduced contact period between the T cell and the APC, which, in turn, decreased proliferation and cytokine production. They concluded that, in addition to increasing LFA-1 adhesion, CTLA-4 also increased the motility of T cells. CTLA-4 is highly expressed on regulatory T cells, and interestingly, one of the proposed inhibitory mechanisms of these cells is to impair stable contact between the APCs and the CD4⁺ T cells (77, 78), thus reversing the stop signal induced by the TCR. Whereas these studies are interesting and provocative, increased motility in the setting of increased adhesion is difficult to understand. Indeed, leukocyte rolling on vascular endothelium is mediated by the relatively weak adhesive forces contributed by selectins, whereas cessation of rolling is mediated by the stronger adhesion mediated by integrins.

A link between CTLA-4 and Rap1 has recently been established (79). The inhibitory effect of CTLA-4 on T-cell function in Rap1-GAP1-transgenic T cells was reduced (30). The transgenic mice overexpressing Rap1-GAP1 showed lymphoproliferation. One model that could explain this result is that Rap1 is required for propagating the inhibitory signal transmitted into the cell by CTLA-4. Consistent with such a model, CTLA-4, like the TCR, directly activates Rap1 in a sustained manner. Interestingly, CD28 costimulation downregulates Rap1 (30). The involvement of Rap1 in the

inhibitory signal of CTLA-4 raises a paradox. On the one hand, stimulated by CTLA-4, Rap1 is a negative regulator of T-cell activation. On the other hand, Rap1 has been proposed to augment T-cell activation by LFA-1. How can the same molecule, Rap1, be required for signaling events that generate opposite outcomes? One explanation may derive from the different methodologies used in these studies: overexpressed Rap1 versus Rap1-GAP1. However, it may also be that subcellular compartmentalization of Rap1 explains the paradox. If CTLA-4 results in activation of Rap1 on intracellular vesicles, the signal output may be entirely different from that initiated at the PM after TCR stimulation.

Another link between Rap1 and CTLA-4 is found in recent studies on ROS and T cells (80). ROS are thought to be one of the ways T cells are inappropriately activated in autoimmune diseases. Persistent ROS production in T cells from patients with rheumatoid arthritis correlates directly with the activation status of Ras and inversely with that of Rap1. As discussed above, CTLA-4 activates Rap1. Remans et al. (80) reported that CTLA-4-Ig (a fusion protein CTLA-4 and IgG1) suppresses ROS production by preventing activation of Ras, probably through interfering with CD28 signaling pathway. It was suggested that CTLA-4 activates Rap1, and this activation results in the reduction of ROS levels.

Rho proteins and their role in adhesion

Members of the Rho subfamily of Ras-related GTPases play crucial roles in the regulation of the cytoskeletal in response to extracellular factors (81). The best studied members of the Rho family are RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42. Activation of RhoA triggers the formation of actin stress fibers and focal adhesion complexes (82), activation of Rac1 elicits actin polymerization at the PM to produce lamellipodia and membrane ruffles (83), and activation of Cdc42 triggers the formation of filopodia (84). Given the intimate relationship between the actin cytoskeleton, focal adhesions, and integrins, it is not surprising that bidirectional integrin signaling involves Rho proteins. Hotchin and Hall (85) demonstrated the importance of the Rho proteins in regulating integrin clustering after engagement of the extracellular matrix. These observations were extended by Clark et al. (86), who showed that multiple aspects of signaling downstream of integrin engagement by fibronectin were differentially dependent on RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42.

In T cells, Rac1 regulates spreading and adhesion to fibronectin in an integrin-dependent manner (87). Rac1-induced spreading was accompanied by cytoskeletal rearrangements and clustering of integrins at the sites of cell adhesion and at the periphery. An activated mutant of Rac1, Rac1V12, did not change the level of integrin expression or the affinity, indicating that Rac1 is involved not in inside-out signaling but rather in outside-in signaling to the cytoskeleton (88).

One of the best characterized effectors for Rac1 and Cdc42 are the p21-activated kinases (PAKs). Both Rac1 and Cdc42 interact with PAKs when bound to GTP and stimulate kinase activity. Price et al. (87) showed that integrin adhesion led to rapid activation of PAKs, suggesting that Rac1 and/or Cdc42 were indeed activated. Cell spreading occurred later, suggesting that Rac1 and/or Cdc42 activation preceded this function. Interestingly, inhibitors of Rac1 and Cdc42 inhibited cell spreading. Interfering with RhoA activity using C3 exoenzyme prevented detachment of the trailing edge and dramatically reduced the rate of migration of T cells. The same was observed after inhibition of the Rho effector ROCK (89). These data confirm that the Rho proteins are critical for T-cell cytoskeleton rearrangement.

Vav-1 is a GEF for Rho family proteins that is highly expressed in lymphocytes. In the absence of Vav-1, there was a partial block in T-cell development involving the transition from double-negative to double-positive and single-positive thymocytes (90). In addition, positive and negative selections were less efficient. TCR-induced proliferation and secretion of cytokines were greatly reduced in Vav-1-deficient T cells. TCR-induced calcium flux and Erk activation were also reduced. In T lymphocytes, signaling from integrins led to phosphorylation of Vav-1 (91, 92). Vav-1 activation led to massive spreading, and expression of dominant-negative Vav-1 blocked integrin-induced spreading. Interestingly, although Vav-1 activated both Rac1 and Cdc42, these proteins were not required for cell spreading. Synergy between Vav-1 and Rac1V12 suggests that, in addition to acting through Rac1 and Cdc42, Vav-1 activates GTPase-independent pathways that contribute to T-cell spreading (91, 92). The association between integrins and Vav-1 is bidirectional. Vav-1 is phosphorylated as a consequence of LFA-1 outside-in signaling, and Vav-1 transduces TCR signals, leading to the activation of LFA-1 (92).

Other links between integrins and Rac1 can be found in the action of the chemokine CXCL12, also known as stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) and the invasin protein utilized by Yersinia to gain entry into enterocytes. CXCL12 promotes T-lymphocyte adhesion by converting α4β1 integrins to a high-avidity (clustered) state (93), resulting in the prompt arrest of T cells on the endothelium (94). Under the same conditions in which CXCL12 activates integrins, the chemokine also activates Rac1. Inhibition of Rac1 impairs CXCL12-mediated adhesion (93). The bacterial protein invasin binds to integrins and promotes entry of Yersinia. This process is thought to involve
inside-out signaling, as Rac1 but not Cdc42 is required for invasion (95).

# The role of GTPases in outside-in signaling

## Cytohesin-1–JAB-1 and T-cell activation

In stark contrast to the extensive details of the molecular signaling events initiated by TCR and CD28, little is known about specific signals induced by engagement of LFA-1 by adhesive ligands such as ICAM-1. One reason that studying the signaling output of LFA-1–ICAM-1 interactions may be difficult is that the adhesive process itself may promote prolonged cell–cell contact and thereby amplifying signals generated by other ligand–receptor pairs. For example, increasing antigen density by more than 100-fold did not initiate CD4⁺T-cell proliferation or cytokine synthesis in the absence of ICAM-1–LFA-1 interaction. Does this result from the requirement for prolonged adhesion to allow the TCR to reach its maximal signaling potential or from a costimulatory pathway initiated by LFA-1? This question can only be answered by understanding what the intrinsic signaling capabilities are of the integrin. Although it is conceivable that TCR and LFA-1 could share downstream pathways and costimulation might result from increased signal amplitude, it is also possible that LFA-1 outside-in signaling may involve pathways not stimulated directly by TCR. ICAM-1–LFA-1 interactions can lead to a sustained intracellular calcium response (96), increased inositol phospholipid hydrolysis, and the appearance of the hyperphosphorylated p23 form of the TCR α chain (97). However, none of these observations fully define LFA-1 signaling capacity.

A significant advance in our understanding of LFA-1 signaling was provided by Bianchi et al. (25), who identified a protein that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of LFA-1. This protein, JAB-1, is a transcriptional coactivator that is found both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm of cells, and a fraction of it is colocalized with LFA-1 at the cell membrane. LFA-1 cross-linking was followed by a rapid increase in the nuclear pool of JAB-1 and activation of activator protein-1 (AP-1), implicating this molecule as a mediator of outside-in signaling.

Work by Nolan and colleagues (24) revealed that LFA-1 activates PKCδ in CD4⁺T cells and that activation of this kinase was associated with phosphorylation of the integrin at serine 745 of the β chain. This phosphorylation event was inhibited by rottlerin, a kinase inhibitor originally thought to be specific for PKCδ but now known to have broad specificity. However, PKCδ specificity was supported by similar effects of cell-permeable PKCδ-specific antagonistic peptides. Interestingly, phosphorylation of β2 at serine 745 in response to integrin cross-linking caused dissociation of JAB-1 from LFA-1, consistent with the results of Bianchi et al. (25). More importantly, this phosphorylation event was required for LFA-1-dependent c-Jun activation and subsequent AP-1 activity. Consistent with these data, T cells stimulated with anti-CD3, anti-CD28, and LFA-1 had more AP-1 activity than cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 alone.

Cytohesin-1 was identified in a yeast two-hybrid screen as a molecule that interacts with the cytoplasmic tail of the β subunit of LFA-1 (98). Cytohesin-1 contains PH and Sec7 domains. Overexpression of cytohesin-1 increased LFA-1 adhesiveness, and subsequent analysis attributed this function to the Sec7 domain of cytohesin-1 that can function as a GEF for Arf6 (98, 99). Thus, cytohesin-1 appears to function in inside-out signaling to LFA-1. Interestingly, Nolan and colleagues (24) have also implicated cytohesin-1 in outside-in signaling. These investigators showed that LFA-1 stimulated Erk activation in Jurkat cells was cytohesin-1 dependent (24). Overexpressed cytohesin-1 was associated with the PM in Jurkat T cells. Treatment with ICAM-1 induced detectable threonine phosphorylation on cytohesin-1, an effect that did not occur with CD3 cross-linking of Jurkat cells, indicating that LFA-1 signals directly through cytohesin-1. Whereas anti-JAB1 peptides completely blocked LFA-1-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation, anti-cytohesin-1 peptides did not affect LFA-1-mediated c-Jun phosphorylation. Treatment of the cells with anti-cytohesin-1 peptides inhibited Erk phosphorylation. These results indicate that LFA-1 can signal to both the Erk and Jnk MAPK pathways through different signaling intermediates and that one of these intermediates, cytohesin-1, functions bidirectionally in LFA-1 signaling.

What is the contribution of LFA-1 in outside-in signaling to T-cell activation? CD3 stimulation alone induces relatively little CD69 expression and small amounts of phosphorylated Erk (100). Costimulation of T cells with CD3 and CD28 enhances both CD69 expression and Erk activation and stimulates IL-2 production. The addition of a ligand for LFA-1 to CD3 and CD28 costimulation produced more CD69 expression than did costimulation of T cells with CD3 and CD28 alone (101). Erk phosphorylation and IL-2 production were also increased (101). LFA-1 also acted as a costimulus for cell cycle progression and proliferation (102). Finally, LFA-1 signaling promoted T-cell differentiation into a T-helper 1 cell phenotype, an outcome that may result from autocrine stimulation of the STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 1) pathway (103). Taken together, these data suggest that LFA-1 mediates important signaling events in T cells independent of the prolonged TCR signaling that is produced by increased adhesion to APCs.

Phospholipase D regulation by LFA-1

Whereas the characterization of JAB-1 and cytoadhesion-1 as regulators of LFA-1 outside-in signaling is intriguing, neither mediator provides a detailed insight into how the integrin is linked to the various Ras/MAPK pathways. By studying Ras activation in T cells, we have recently discovered that LFA-1 links to the Ras/MAPK pathway through phospholipase D (PLD), a relatively well-characterized signaling molecule. We previously reported that TCR stimulation led to activation of Ras only on the Golgi that was mediated by the exchange factor RasGRP1 (104). We have now discovered that costimulation of LFA-1, along with cross-linking the TCR, stimulates Ras activation on both the Golgi and the PM and that activation on both compartments requires RasGRP1 (unpublished observations). RasGRP1 is regulated by diacylglycerol (DAG). The recent reports of DAG kinase (DGK) acting as a negative regulator of Ras/MAPK signaling and T-cell activation (105, 106) are consistent with our observations because DGK is among the ways in which the cell can limit the biologic activity of DAG. Engagement of LFA-1 increased DAG levels at the PM by stimulating PLD, which generates phosphatidic acid that is rapidly converted into DAG by phosphatidic acid phosphatase. Thus, LFA-1 acts through PLD to reshape the pattern of Ras activation downstream of the TCR.

What might be the biological implications of altered spatial patterns of Ras/MAPK signaling in T cells? Recently, Palmer and colleagues (107) have shed light on this question by showing that peptides that drive negative selection activate the Ras/MAPK pathway at the PM, whereas those that drive positive selection of thymocytes activate this pathway at the Golgi. Thus, LFA-1 may not only strengthen signaling by prolonging the adhesion of the T cell and the APC, but in regulating the spatial distribution of signaling, it may also have an influence over cell fate.

### Conclusion

LFA-1 is both a receptor and an adhesion molecule with variable affinity states. As such, it is a transmembrane protein that is inhibited by CD28 engagement. Rap1 is also regulated by GEFs, such as C3G and Epac1, and GAPs, such as Rap1-GAP1. Once activated, Rap1 can regulate LFA-1 by either RAPL/Mst1 binding or RIAM/talin recruitment.

engages in both outside-in and inside-out signaling. In this review, we have considered the roles of Rap1, Rho proteins, adapter proteins, JAB-1, cytohesin-1, CTLA-4, and PLD in bidirectional signaling through LFA-1. Rap1 signaling through RAPL and RIAM appears to be central to LFA-1 regulation (Fig. 2). Although Rap1, like all monomeric GTPases, is a simple binary molecular switch, its role in LFA-1 regulation is not straightforward, in that Rap1 activation can have several distinct

and opposing outcomes. Rap1 exists in two pools in the cell, one on perinuclear vesicles and one on the PM. One model that reconciles the opposing actions of Rap1 is to hypothesize that these pools have differential effects on LFA-1. If this is correct, then Rap1 signaling can be thought of as being compartmentalized in a fashion analogous to Ras, which has opposing effects on thymocyte selection, depending upon which membrane platform signaling is initiated (107).
