■ Abstract The human T cell leukemia virus-1 (HTLV-1) is a retrovirus that causes adult T cell leukemia (ATL) and neurological disorder, the tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The pathogenesis apparently results from the pleiotropic function of Tax protein, which is a key regulator of viral replication. Tax exerts (a) trans-activation and -repression of transcription of different sets of cellular genes through binding to groups of transcription factors and coactivators, (b) dysregulation of cell cycle through binding to inhibitors of CDK4/6, and (c) inhibition of some tumor suppressor proteins. These effects on a wide variety of cellular targets seem to cooperate in promoting cell proliferation of infected cells; ultimately it results in cell transformation and leukemogenesis.

## INTRODUCTION

Proliferation and differentiation of eukaryotic cells are triggered by extracellular signals and are regulated downstream of signal transduction. Accumulation of genetic alterations controlling these regulatory systems is thought to be the origin of cancers. Infection with tumor virus is equivalent to the genetic alteration integrating the viral genome into the host cell DNA.

Human tumor viruses including human T cell leukemia viruses, Epstein-Barr virus, human papillomavirus, and human hepatitis B and C viruses provide unique systems to study the mechanisms of human cancers. They also provide useful strategies for diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of the specific cancers. Among these, human T cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1) is unique both because it is a retrovirus (1, 2) and also because it acts in the etiology of leukemogenesis (3, 4) and a myelopathy, HAM/TSP (5, 6). HTLV-1 causes adult T cell leukemia (ATL), which is a malignancy of CD4-positive T cells; it frequently has an abnormal nucleus and high level of expression of interleukin 2 receptor α subunit. HTLV-1 does not efficiently replicate in vivo and is transmitted through infected T cells in breast milk (from mother to child), in semen (from male to female), and in blood (transfusion).

As the result of its natural infection pattern, HTLV-1 and the associated diseases appear in familial and local aggregation and are clustered in Southern Japan, South America, Central Africa, and South-East Asia. The lifelong risk for ATL among an infected population is 3%–5%, but no effective therapy is yet available.

Unlike acute leukemia viruses of animal origin, HTLV-1 has no typical oncogene derived from the cellular genome, but rather it has an extra sequence of 1.6 kb (called pX region) in the 3′ terminal region of its genome (7). The pX region codes for several proteins including Tax (8, 9), Rex (10, 11), p21X-III (10), p12 (12), and others (13) by combination of the reading frames and alternative splicing (14, 15). Expression of retroviral genomes is generally regulated by cis-acting elements in the long terminal repeat (LTR). The cis-acting elements of HTLV-1 are uniquely regulated by a trans-acting factor, Tax, encoded by the pX region (16–18). Thus, Tax is essential for the effective replication of HTLV-1. Tax is also believed to contribute to its pathogenesis through its capacity to immortalize primary T cells (19), to transform rodent fibroblasts (20, 21), and to induce tumors in transgenic mice expressing Tax (22, 23). This proposal is consistent with its pleiotropic, biochemical, and cellular functions.

In this review, the molecular biology of Tax is summarized, focusing on the possible mechanisms of host-cell regulation. The effects of Tax cover transcriptional activation of a specific set of cellular genes, trans-repression of another set of genes, and cell cycle promotion through inactivation of different types of tumor suppressor proteins. The target molecules are CREB, CREM, NF-κB, IkB, SRF, and CBP/p300 for activation, E47, p53, and CBP/p300 for repression, and p16INK4a, p15INK4b, p18INK4c, and hDlg for cell cycle promotion. Such pleiotropic effects of Tax protein seem to be the viral strategy to induce effective proliferation of infected cells to amplify its proviruses, which in turn immortalize and transform the infected cells. In addition to Tax, HTLV-1 expresses other minor proteins such as p12 (12, 14) and p35 (13) as a result of alternative splicing of the same region of the viral genome. These minor proteins are not covered in this review, although some of these related proteins also have the capacity to modulate cellular function and are required for in vivo replication (24).

## ONCOGENIC ROLE OF TAX PROTEIN

The original prediction for viral involvement in leukemogenesis was made based on the finding of provirus integration in leukemic cells of ATL patients: Every ATL cell contained the proviral genome integrated in its chromosomal DNA, and the integration sites were clonal within individuals, indicating that leukemic cells originated from a single infected T cell (25). However, the sites were not common among patients (26). Therefore, the cis-acting effect of the LTR (long terminal repeat) of integrated proviruses seems unlikely to be the mechanism for ATL. Consequently, a trans-acting viral factor, Tax, has been proposed to be pivotal in the viral pathogenicity.

Independent from these in vivo studies, cell biology research demonstrated the oncogenic capacity of Tax: introduction of expression vector of Tax immortalized primary CD4-positive T cells (27); transfection of a Tax-expressing vector transformed Rat-1 and NIH3T3 to proliferate in suspension in soft agar (20); and furthermore, the vector transformed even primary rat fibroblasts in cooperation with ras oncogene (21). Transgenic mice carrying the tax gene under the control of the LTR developed tumors, although they were of mesenchymal origin (22). Mice with tax gene under the T cell-specific promoter developed leukemia/lymphoma (23), although it was not similar to ATL. All these in vitro findings clearly indicate the oncogenic capacity of Tax in vivo.

# PLEIOTROPIC FUNCTION OF TAX

Tax is a 40-kDa protein mainly localized in the nucleus and originally identified as a *trans*-activator of viral gene expression responding to the 21-bp enhancer in the LTR (17, 16). Transcriptional regulation is the most critical step in retroviral replication; thus, studies initially focused on this function. Then this function of Tax was found to enhance expression of cellular oncogenes, growth factors, and some of their receptors, and more attention was directed to understanding the mechanism of cellular gene activation. Meanwhile, some other genes were found to be repressed by Tax, including tumor suppressor genes; therefore, research became more focused on *trans*-repression than *trans*-activation with respect to the leukemogenesis. This direction was further accelerated by the finding that Tax binds directly to and inhibits some tumor suppressor proteins. These functions of Tax not only induce abnormal cell proliferation, which may lead to malignant transformation, but they also increase the mutation rate or apoptotic resistance, although these mechanisms are not well understood.

## Transcriptional Activation

Transcriptional activation is basically achieved by two independent mechanisms: The first is the binding of Tax to enhancer-binding proteins on the DNA such as CREB, NF-$\kappa$B, and SRF, and the second is the inhibition or destabilization of inhibitors of transcription factors such as IkB (28). The first is a general mechanism for three different enhancers and explains well how Tax is able to respond to structurally unrelated enhancers. The second is specific to activation of NF-$\kappa$B in the cytoplasm (Figure 1). These mechanisms are briefly reviewed in the following section, then their pathological significance is discussed.

### CREB and CREM

To activate the viral LTR, Tax requires at least two copies of the 21-bp enhancer containing an imperfect CRE (cAMP-responsive element), to which binds cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) (29, 30), cyclic AMP response element modulator (CREM) (29), activating transcription factors (ATFs) (31), Tax-responsive element binding proteins (TREB), and 21-bp

binding proteins (HEBs; 32). The CREB and CREM proteins bind to Tax protein on the 21-bp enhancer without specific phosphorylation.

In normally regulated cells, CREB is phosphorylated by protein kinase A upon stimulation of the cell (33), and the phosphorylation of CREB allows its binding to a transcriptional activator, CBP (34, 35). The CBP thus associated with DNA would acetylate histone through its histone-acetylating activity (36–38), resulting in opening the nucleosome structure around the transcriptional site (39), thus leading to activation of transcription. Thus, CRE-dependent transcription becomes signal dependent. On the other hand, Tax was found to bind to CBP (40); therefore, Tax would be able to bridge between CREB and CBP without specific phosphorylation of CREB. This abnormal interaction of CREB-Tax-CBP would be able to explain the constitutive activation of the 21-bp enhancer in HTLV-1-infected cells (41, 42).

However, we have previously reported that the consensus sequence of the CRE is not trans-activated by Tax, and a unique but small flanking sequence upstream of the CRE is required (43); therefore, it is postulated that some other mechanism or factor is involved. This puzzle is still not well solved, but thus far different observations have been reported. Adya et al (44) reported that CREB protein, bound to the viral 21-bp enhancer but not to the consensus CRE, is able to undergo conformational change in the presence of Tax; thus, the complex on the DNA element is stabilized. On the other hand, Nyborg et al (45) claimed that Tax has to interact with 21-bp enhancer DNA directly for trans-activation. Recently, PCAF
(p300/CBP-associated factor), a transcriptional coactivator (46), was reported to interact with Tax and *trans*-activate transcription in a histone-acetyltransferase-independent manner (47, 48). It is not clear whether PCAF is involved in the 21-bp-specific *trans*-activation; however, further studies on Tax-induced *trans*-activation would elucidate more complete features of CREB-mediated transcription.

**hGli2** At least two copies of the viral 21-bp enhancer are required for efficient activation by Tax in reconstituted promoter systems. Despite this principle, a series of deletion mutagenesis of the LTR indicated that an LTR fragment containing a single copy of the third 21-bp is highly activated by Tax (49, 50). Analyzing this phenomenon, we identified another sequence termed TRE-2 (Tax-responsive element-2) adjacent to the third copy of the 21-bp as an additional element responsible for the activation. A newly identified protein, hGli2, binds to TRE-2 (51), and the binding of hGli2 to TRE-2 is essential for Tax-mediated *trans*-activation of one copy of the 21-bp enhancer. It has been revealed that hGli2 binding to TRE-2 enhanced the recruitment of CREB onto the adjacent element 21-bp (52). The recruited CREB would now be able to bind to Tax to activate transcription similarly to the *trans*-activation through two copies of the 21-bp enhancer.

**NF-$\kappa$B Activation of NF-$\kappa$B** HTLV-1-infected T cell lines frequently produce various lymphokines such as interleukin-6 (IL-6), granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), tumor necrosis factor $\beta$ (TNF$\beta$), and others (53). One of the characteristics of ATL cells is overexpression of the alpha subunit of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R$\alpha$) (54). This overexpression or overproduction is mediated by activation of a transcription factor family NF-$\kappa$B. The interaction of NF-$\kappa$B with Tax was originally identified by immunoprecipitation of an NF-$\kappa$B precursor, p105, with anti-Tax antibodies from HTLV-1-infected cell extracts (55). It is now well established that Tax binds to NF-$\kappa$B family proteins including NF-$\kappa$B p50, p65, c-Rel (56, 57), and NF-$\kappa$B-2 (lyt10; 58) and activates the NF-$\kappa$B-dependent transcription.

The NF-$\kappa$B proteins bind to p300 (59, 60, 61), similarly to the interaction of CREB and CBP (discussed above). Therefore, a mechanism similar to activation of CRE-dependent transcription through Tax-CREB interaction has been predicted for the activation of NF-$\kappa$B-dependent transcription by Tax (41). Abnormally high expression of IL-2R$\alpha$ on ATL cells might also be explained by this mechanism (62).

**Inactivation of $I_{\kappa}B$** In unstimulated cells, NF-$\kappa$B proteins are held up in the cytoplasm as an inactive complex with $I_{\kappa}B$ (63). Stimulatory signals phosphorylate $I_{\kappa}B$ and destabilize it, resulting in release from the inactive complex and nuclear translocation of the active form of NF$\kappa$B, thus enhancing NF-$\kappa$B-dependent transcription. Therefore, HTLV-1-infected cells require an additional mechanism for NF-$\kappa$B activation by Tax in the nucleus. This mechanism is the binding
of Tax to IκBα, which results in destabilization of IκBα and nuclear translocation of NFκB (64, 65). In addition to the simple binding of Tax to IκB, activation of cytokine-inducible kinases, IKKα and IKKβ, was reported to result in constitutive phosphorylation and degradation followed by nuclear translocation of NF-κB (66). Therefore, two independent processes appear to be involved in activation of NFκB. This is evidence that Tax also functions in the cytoplasm.

**SRF (Serum Response Factor)** For the *trans*-activation of the immediate early nuclear oncogenes, c-fos and c-egr, Tax binds to a serum responsive factor (p67<sup>SRF</sup>) (67, 56) on SRE. Biologically inactive mutants of Tax did not bind to p67<sup>SRF</sup>, indicating that the complex formation is important for *trans*-activation. It is uncertain which transcriptional coactivator is involved in this activation.

## Transcriptional Repression

When the Tax-mediated *trans*-activation was actively investigated, an opposite function, *trans*-repression, was described in the expression of DNA polymerase β (68). The mechanism of the *trans*-repression, however, has not been well characterized until recently. The finding regarding *trans*-repression of Tax on p18INK4c gene, a family member of the inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinase, and the effect on p53 revealed the linkage between *trans*-repression and leukemogenesis.

P18INK4c is an inhibitor of CDK4, a member of tumor suppressor gene p16INK4a, and is thus able to arrest the cell at G1 phase of the cell cycle. We found downregulation of the promoter activity of p18INK4 by Tax expression (69, 70); the so-called E-Box element in the p18INK4 gene is responsible for the *trans*-repression. An E-Box-binding protein, E47, showed no interaction with Tax (42). This finding suggested a mechanistic correlation between *trans*-activation and *trans*-repression through interaction of Tax with CBP/p300 (40), which is able to interact with CREB and also with E47 (see Figure 2).

## Transcriptional Coactivators, CBP/p300

A reporter plasmid carrying the E-Box sequence was activated by cotransfection of E-47 and p300, and the enhanced expression was efficiently *trans*-repressed by Tax (42). E47 is an E-Box binding protein, and p300 is a member of the transcriptional co-activator family, CBP/p300 (71, 72). The binding of E47 to the E-Box DNA was not affected by Tax, but association of p300 with the E47-DNA complex was decreased by Tax. The decrease of p300 association was correlated with *trans*-repression and also correlated with the formation of Tax-p300 complex (42), clearly indicating that Tax binds to p300 and interferes with the integration of p300 into the E47-E-Box complex, thus resulting in downregulation of transcription. This conclusion implies that Tax and transcription factors compete with coactivators CBP/p300, and their expression levels and affinity to CBP/p300 affect the efficiency of transcription; that is, the cascade of Tax in transcriptional repression is unexpectedly wide in its targets and highly variable in its effectiveness.

Figure 2 Proposed mechanisms for trans-activation and trans-repression by HTLV-1 Tax. Tax binds to CBP/p300 and either accelerates interaction with CREB or interferes with interaction with p53 or E47.

**Transcription Factor p53** Recently, it has been reported that p53-dependent transcription is repressed by Tax protein (73, 74). The p53-dependent transcription requires binding of the p53-CBP complex to the p53-binding site of the reporter (75). Similarly to the case of p18INK4c promoter, CBP binding to p53 on the p53-binding site was effectively inhibited by Tax binding to CBP (42). Therefore, the same mechanism as that for E-Box-mediated trans-repression has been proposed, namely, Tax binding to CBP interferes with the interaction of CBP with p53 on the DNA (76, 77).

Other mechanisms have also been reported for the repression of p53-mediated transcription. In HTLV-1-infected cells, Ser-15 of p53 is hyperphosphorylated and p53 is inactive in interaction with transcription factor TFIID, although it is active in sequence-specific DNA binding (78). Although the mechanism for hyperphosphorylation is not elucidated, apparently the mechanism for the inactivation of p53 is categorically different from the events on specific DNA element. Another finding is NF-$\kappa$B-dependent inactivation of p53 (79). According to this report, Tax inactivation of p53 correlates with NF-$\kappa$B activation but not with CBP/p300 squelching. Interestingly, Tax failed to inactivate p53 in NF-$\kappa$B p65 knockout mouse embryo fibroblasts (79). Redundancy and cross-talk of regulatory pathways are operating, and the viral infection seems able to modify these pathways through a single protein, Tax.

Unified Principle for Trans-Activation and Trans-Repression

To molecular biologists, it is an interesting question how a single protein is able to activate one set of gene expression and to repress another set. After finding transcriptional coactivators, CBP/p300, as the common factors between the opposite responses to Tax function, we proposed a unified principle for the trans-activation and -repression: “Tax binds to CBP/p300, and when Tax in the Tax-CBP/p300 has high affinity to transcription factors, the interaction would result in trans-activation, but when Tax in the protein complex has no affinity to transcription factors, the interaction would result in trans-repression” (42; see Figure 2). In fact, Tax was confirmed to recruit CBP/p300 efficiently into enhancer-transcription factor complex when Tax has affinity to the transcription factor (42). The effects of Tax in this unified principle would depend on the affinity of Tax to CBP/p300 in transactivation and also on the competing ability of transcription factors with Tax to CBP/p300 in trans-repression. Particularly in trans-repression, the competing capacity would be greatly affected by the affinity of transcription factors to CBP/p300 (72) and by the expression levels of the transcription factors; it would thus be highly variable. Competition with low levels of CBP/p300 (80) would take place not only with Tax but also among transcription factors. However, the full situation seems to be more complex, since histone acetyltransferase-independent trans-activation has been described even in the CBP/p300-dependent transcription system (47).

Inhibition of Tumor Suppressor Proteins

Independently from transcriptional regulation, Tax was found to interact with negative regulators of cyclin-dependent kinases, inhibitors of CDK4 (INK4) (19, 81). A typical member of the INK4 family is p16INK4a, which is also known to be a tumor suppressor gene in many types of human tumors (82). When the negative function of p16INK4a is impaired, CDK4/6 is activated and phosphorylates Rb, a tumor-suppressor protein. Hyperphosphorylated Rb then releases E2F as an active form, a family of transcription factors, and then activates expression of various genes required for progression of cells from G1 to S phase (83, 84). The clue for p16INK4a as a Tax target came from the binding domain of IkB for Tax, the ankyrin motif, which is also contained in the INK4 family proteins (85). P16INK4a is an effective target of Tax protein.

p16INK4a and p15INK4b, Cell Cycle Regulators

The binding of Tax to p16INK4a was demonstrated in vitro using GST-p16INK4a and also in vivo using cotransfection followed by immunoprecipitation (81). The binding of Tax to p16INK4a inhibited its negative function on CDK4/6 and thus rescued the kinase activity from the inhibition by p16INK4a (81; see Figure 3). A mutant of Tax, D320, which binds to Tax, also restored the kinase activity, but another mutant that does not bind to Tax was unable to do so. The effect of Tax binding to p16INK4a on cell proliferation was examined using a cell line U2OS that lacks the

p16INK4a gene but retains the wild-type Rb. The results indicated that the binding of Tax to p16INK4a was able to activate CDK4/6 and phosphorylated Rb and then to induce G1/S phase transition of the target cells (81).

Exactly the same results were obtained with p15INK4b, another member of the INK4 family; therefore, both p16INK4a and p15INK4b are functionally knocked out by Tax protein (70). These two genes are recognized as tumor suppressor genes, MTS-1 and -2, and are frequently deleted in human cancer cells (82). Therefore, the Tax-induced functional inactivation of these two INK4 family proteins might mimic the effect of deletion of these genes in cancer cells, strongly suggesting involvement of this mechanism in ATL development.

**hDlg Which Associates with APC** A yeast two hybrid system using Tax as a bait was used to isolate a human counterpart of Dlg, a drosophila tumor suppressor gene (86). hDlg is a signaling molecule downstream of the Wnt/Frizzle pathway (87) and interacts with the C-terminus of a tumor suppressor protein, APC (88). Tax was found to bind to the same domain, PDZ domain, of hDlg in vitro and also in vivo (89, 90); therefore, the C-terminus of Tax and APC compete with the same site of the hDlg molecule (86). Furthermore, Tax-expression induced hyperphosphorylation of hDlg, as demonstrated by slower migration in gel electrophoresis (86). The Tax mutant at the C-terminus, which cannot bind to hDlg, did not

induce slower migration of the band; thus, Tax binding to hDlg is responsible for the induction of hyperphosphorylation. Through these two effects of Tax, binding competition with APC and hyperphosphorylation of hDlg, Tax is able to induce cell growth. BrUdR incorporation assay into newly synthesized DNA demonstrated that binding of Tax to hDlg is able to perturb the cytostatic effect of hDlg and to promote abnormal proliferation of cells. However, here, one may argue that APC is a tumor suppressor gene of the colon, but not of lymphocytes. In such discussion, it is noteworthy that APC and hDlg are significantly expressed in normal T cells (T Suzuki, M Yoshida, unpublished observation); thus, these interactions might have some roles in T cells, although they are not well understood.

## Functional Similarities of Tax and Transforming Proteins of DNA Tumor Viruses

Viral oncogenes are not required for retroviral replication; however, Tax is essential for gene expression and replication of HTLV-1. The physiological significance of Tax is thus in contrast to the retroviral oncogenes, but rather similar to the transforming proteins of DNA tumor viruses (84). T antigens of SV 40 and poliovirus, E1A of adenoviruses, and E6/7 of papillomaviruses are all required for viral replication and also modify cellular regulation through multiple mechanisms.

Similarities are also pointed out in the cellular targets and/or targeted signaling pathway. Tax inactivates p16INK4a and p15INK4b, inhibitors of CDK4/6, which are upstream of Rb targeted by the transforming proteins of DNA tumor viruses, T-Ag, E1A, and E7 (see Figure 3). That is, retrovirus HTLV-1 and DNA tumor viruses knock out the same signaling pathway although targeting different components (84). The targeting hDlg is also shared among Tax 86, E6 of high-risk HPV (89, 91), and E49RF1 protein of adenoviruses (89). CBP/p300 also interacts with T-Ag and E1A (92–94).

It is surprising to recognize that developmentally unrelated viruses target such similar molecules and signaling pathways among the many regulatory mechanisms. A possible explanation may reside in the key function of the targets; that is, they are critical for normal regulation of cell proliferation; therefore, modulation of these pathways is the most effective strategy to induce unregulatable cell growth. Irrespective of viral evolution, tumor viruses that acquired the most effective strategy for their replication could have survived until today. If this hypothesis is accepted, then it can be further deduced that these signaling molecules play key roles in fibroblastic and lymphoid tissues.

Another surprising aspect is the reason retrovirus and DNA virus should share the targets for their replication. In general, retroviruses require transcription, and DNA viruses require DNA replication as a critical replicative process. The reason why HTLV-1 adopted the strategy to enhance proliferation of infected cells might be as follows: HTLV-1 adopted the strategy to repress its own replication to survive under strong pressure of immunosurveillance in humans. To achieve this, HTLV-1 would have acquired a negative regulator, Rex, downregulating

viral gene expression (not discussed sufficiently in this review; see Ref. 95) and HTLV-1 replication become transient, maintained at low levels and mostly latent in vivo (96). Therefore, replication of the host cells into which its genome was integrated would be required to amplify the viral genome, similar to DNA tumor viruses enhancing cellular DNA replication.

# Domains for Tax Interaction

Tax now appears to interact with many proteins, and certainly, more will be found. However, the interacting domains of Tax protein are not well defined thus far. Only some mutants were informative. For example, d3 (55) and M22 (97) mutating at the N-terminal region do not bind to CREB, but do bind to NF-$\kappa$B; and mutant M4797 substituting at the C-terminal region binds to CREB, but not to NF-$\kappa$B. These mutants clearly indicate that the domains for these interactions are not identical, but data are not adequate to define the whole feature of the domains. For binding to CBP/p300, a region around amino acid residues 82 to 89 was proposed to be important (98).

On the other hand, the interacting domains of the target proteins have been defined in some cases: a basic region adjacent to the leucine zipper structure of CREB (99), Rel-homology domain of NF-$\kappa$B (57), ankyrin motifs of IkB (85), KIX domain of CBP (100), PDZ domain of hDlg (89, 86), and others. No significant homology has been identified among the primary amino acid sequences of these domains, apparently suggesting that the binding domains for Tax might be arranged by protein folding, but nothing certain is known in this respect.

# COOPERATION AND CROSS-TALK OF PLEIOTROPIC FUNCTIONS OF TAX

Tax protein functions at different levels, activating and repressing transcription, and inhibiting cell cycle regulators and tumor suppressor proteins. Why is Tax so pleiotropic? Are only some of these effects associated with malignant transformation? There is no definite answer to these questions today, but interesting and suggestive discussion is possible.

## Cell Proliferation

Tax targets for trans-activation are lymphokines such as IL-6 (101), GM-CSF (102), and TGF$\beta$ (103), lymphokine receptors such as IL-2 receptor $\alpha$ (62), and nuclear oncogenes such as c-fos (104), c-egr, and c-jun (105). These genes are trans-activated independently through NF-$\kappa$B and SRF but are mostly growth-promoting genes; thus, this trans-activation would be cooperative for efficient proliferation of infected cells. Furthermore, the genes trans-repressed by Tax include p18INK4c (70), Lck (106), a tyrosine kinase that downregulates T cell stimulation, and NF-1 (107), a tumor suppressor protein of neurofibromatosis.

Interestingly, these are mostly growth-retarding genes; thus, these *trans*-repression mechanisms would again cooperate with each other and also with *trans*-activation of other sets of genes for efficient proliferation of infected cells (Figure 4).

Furthermore, other effects of Tax on tumor suppressor proteins such as p16-INK4a, p15 (81, 108), cyclin D3 (19), and hDlg (89, 86) result in abnormal promotion of the cell cycle, which frequently links to malignant transformation. After all, most of the genes targeted by Tax through categorically different mechanisms seem to cooperate to promote cell proliferation. A surprising aspect is that a single protein, Tax, is able to affect so many targets, mostly directed to cell proliferation. Such a situation is unlikely to be a coincidental selection of targets by Tax; this therefore suggests a few possible molecules that coordinate divergent and redundant regulatory machinery for cell proliferation and differentiation. Tax may mimic these putative molecules.

## Cell Cycle Check Point, Mutation, and Apoptosis

Tax affects genes the functions of which are not directly linked to cell proliferation. One is *trans*-repression of DNA polymerase β (68), a key enzyme for DNA repair. DNA polymerase β is involved in repair of damaged DNA; therefore, *trans*-repression of this gene might result in higher frequency of mutation in host cells.

**Figure 4** Pleiotropic function of Tax. Four different categories of Tax function and their direct targets and final target genes are summarized.

Other possible mechanisms for higher mutation rate have also been proposed: direct inhibition of topoisomerase I by Tax (109) and trans-activation by Tax of PCNA gene (cellular proliferating cell nuclear antigen (110). As expected from these molecular analyses, a mutagenic effect of Tax on host cell chromosomes was directly demonstrated (111, 112). Thus, Tax expression and modulation of DNA polymerase β, topoisomerase I, and/or PCNA predispose cells to accumulation of DNA damage and contribute to malignant conversion of infected cells.

In relation to DNA damage and its repair, attention should be focused on the Tax effects on p53. Trans-repression of p53-dependent transcription is particularly notable (73, 74, 42). In addition to this trans-repression, inactivation of p53 through phosphorylation of Ser-15 (78) and NF-κB-dependent inactivation of p53 (79) have been described. The details are not known yet, but it is apparent that activation of kinase, activation of NF-κB, and trans-repression of p53-dependent transcription all cooperate to abolish the cell cycle check point function of p53, thus leading cells to accumulation of DNA mutations in cells. Continuous disposition of infected cells to such a situation would accelerate malignant transformation and thus progression to ATL.

Cell cycle processes are inspected at checkpoints and allowed to progress only when the scheduled processes are verified. Thus, once the checkpoint system faces any problem, undesired cells can go through their cell cycle and proliferate, fixing the abnormality. Tax of HTLV-1 was described to bind to the human homolog (HsMAD1) of yeast mitotic checkpoint protein MAD1 (113). HsMAD1 is a component of the mitotic checkpoint system that prevents anaphase and commitment to cellular division until chromosomal alignment is properly completed. Therefore, abrogation of the mitotic checkpoint function of HsMAD1 may be linked to abnormal cell division and accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities. These cells are triggered to undergo apoptosis. Tax protein, however, is able to prevent apoptosis that arises from suppression of p53 function through activation of NF-κB and trans-activation of Bcl-X (114) or expression of XIAP (X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis) protein (115). Other possible mechanisms include repression of bax gene expression (116).

In summary, most of the pleiotropic functions of Tax protein cooperate in promoting cell proliferation, accumulation of DNA damage, and avoiding apoptosis of abnormal cells infected with HTLV-1.

## TRANSIENT OR RARE EXPRESSION OF TAX IN VIVO AND ATL DEVELOPMENT

As discussed in the previous sections, the pleiotropic function of Tax cooperates to promote proliferation of HTLV-1-infected cells; therefore, these would be the early mechanism of ATL development in vivo. Consistent with the prediction, infected cells in vivo are random in their clonality. However, leukemic cells are always monoclonal at their proviral integration site within an individual patient.

Apparently, Tax alone is not sufficient for the clonal expansion of infected cells, but nothing is known about such genetic event(s). Even for the early mechanism, the expression level of Tax has been thought to be too low; that is, the expression can be detected only by PCR and is absolutely negative in over 95% of infected cells. Such low expression is observed in both leukemic and nonleukemic cells. However, once cells are taken out and put into culture, these cells initiate viral gene expression as rapidly as a few hours after cultivation. Such extremely low expression of Tax is always a target of discussion in the application of in vitro observations to ATL development.

Continuous expression of the viral antigens would not be possible since such cells would be rejected by the host immune response; therefore, expression has to be transient, otherwise infected cells would not be able to survive in vivo. Therefore, it is reasonable to predict that a certain level of Tax is transiently expressed in a limited population of infected cells at one time and in another cell population at another time. For example, a small number of infected cells could be stimulated to express Tax, and its expression would be diminished soon by feedback regulation by Rex and then become latent for a while. Different specificity of stimulation would induce Tax expression in a different population of T cells. During transient expression of Tax, a cell proliferation would be efficiently enhanced in a given population through multiple mechanisms. Such a situation would take place in carriers repeatedly for a long period, even after clonal expansion of infected cells (Figure 5). During the early stage, cell growth-promoting effects would be significant in increasing the cell population for malignant transformation, but in the later

**Figure 5** Possible roles of Tax in ATL initiation and progression. Tax promotes abnormal growth of a small population of infected cells where it is expressed, increases the cell population for transformation, and also promotes cell growth even after progression of infected cells toward more malignancy. V: HTLV-infected cell; VX: HTLV-expressing cell.

stages, functions related to accumulation of mutations and prevention of apoptosis may have more significance. In this respect, Tax is able to function as a tumor initiator as well as a tumor promoter.

For example, Tax inhibits tumor suppressor protein p16INK4a during its transient expression; thus, cells can undergo abnormal growth with the wild-type expression of p16INK4a. In fact, HTLV-1-infected T cell lines mostly maintain p16INK4a genes, although all uninfected T cell lines do not. Even though this is true in infected cells, deletion of p16INK4a in infected cells would allow more efficient proliferation than that by Tax-induced functional inhibition; therefore, once p16INK4a deletion is taking place in infected cells, the cells would progress more easily to ATL cells. Therefore, the finding that some ATL patients have deletion of p16INK4a gene 117 can be explained without any difficulty.

Finally, it should be emphasized that Tax alone is apparently not sufficient to explain the final leukemia. It is still necessary to identify second, third, or even further molecular events during the progression of ATL for the full understanding of ATL.
