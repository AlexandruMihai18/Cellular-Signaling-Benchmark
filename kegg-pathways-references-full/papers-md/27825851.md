## Abstract

The apelin/apelin receptor system is widely distributed and has a dominant role in cardiovascular homeostasis and disease. The apelin gene is X-linked and is synthesized as a 77 amino acid pre-pro-peptide that is subsequently cleaved to generate a family of apelin peptides that possess similar functions but display different tissue distribution, potency and receptor binding affinity. Loss-of-function experiments using the apelin and the apelin receptor knockout mice and gain-of-function experiments using apelin peptides have delineated a well-defined role of the apelin axis in cardiovascular physiology and diseases. Activation of the apelin receptor by its cognate peptide ligand, apelin, induces a wide range of physiological effects, including vasodilation, increased myocardial contractility, angiogenesis, and balanced energy metabolism and fluid homeostasis. The apelin/apelin receptor pathway is also implicated in atherosclerosis, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure, diabetes and obesity, making it a promising therapeutic target. Hence, research is expanding to develop novel therapies that inhibit degradation of endogenous apelin peptides or their analogues. Chemical synthesis of stable apelin receptor agonists aims to more efficiently enhance the activation of the apelin system. Targeting the apelin/apelin receptor axis has emerged as a novel therapeutic approach against cardiovascular diseases and an increased understanding of cardiovascular actions of the apelin system will help to develop effective interventions.

## 1. Introduction

Apelin is an endogenous peptide capable of binding the apelin receptor, which was originally described as an orphan G-protein-coupled receptor [1]. Upon proteolysis through a not fully elucidated mechanism, pre-pro-apelin is converted into specific fragments ranging from 36 to 13 amino acids, with the 12 C-terminal amino acids conserved among all apelin isoforms [2]. Both apelin and apelin receptor are expressed across a wide range of eukaryotes including humans, in a variety of tissues including the central nervous and cardiovascular systems [3]. Apelin and its cognate receptor are essential for diverse biological processes and play important roles in the regulation of cardiovascular function [4,5]. The beneficial effects of the apelin/apelin receptor system are well established by treating with apelin in conditions as diverse as hypertension, atherosclerosis, myocardial infarction, heart failure (HF) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) [6–8]. Recently, the apelin receptor has been shown to be activated by a novel endogenous peptide ligand known as apela/Elabela/Toddler, with an important role in cardiovascular development and function [9,10]. This further enriched the understanding of the multiple physiological mechanisms of the apelin/apelin receptor system. The abilities of exogenous apelin to rescue heart and vascular diseases support the therapeutic potential of apelin in preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases. Nonetheless, therapeutic application of apelin is limited by its short half-life and parenteral administration. Thus great effort has been directed to the development of novel agonists or analogues, efficient delivery methods and improved efficacy of agonists at the apelin receptor [11]. This review summarizes the development and the latest advances concerning the

apelin/apelin receptor signaling pathway and its role in cardiovascular physiology.

## 2. Physiology of the apelin pathway

### 2.1. Biochemistry

The apelin gene is located on the X chromosome and is synthesized as a 77 amino acids pre-pro-peptide that contains a high number of basic amino acid residues [1]. Pyr-apelin 13 and apelin 17 are the predominant isoforms in plasma whereas apelin 36 is predominant in lung, testis, uterus and colostrum [12–15]. Furthermore, pyr-apelin 13 has been detected as the primary isoform in human heart, bearing the greatest affinity for the apelin receptor [1,13,15]. Binding with apelin 13 leads to internalization of the apelin receptor followed by recycling to the cell surface whereas apelin 36 promotes intracellular sequestration of the receptor [16]. Although the apelin receptor is present in both vascular endothelium and vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC), the predominant source of apelin appears to be located in the endothelium as well as in adipocytes [17,18].

Apelin 13 and 36 have short plasma half-lives in the range of 5–8 min. This is attributed to the degradation by endogenous circulating proteases [15,19]. Interestingly, apelin 13 and apelin 36 are substrates of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [20,21], which is a pleiotropic monooxypeptidase capable of catalyzing a diverse range of peptide substrates [22,23]. There is a functional interplay between apelin and ACE2 characterized by increased ACE2 promoter activity *in vitro* and elevated expression of ACE2 in failing hearts *in vivo* in response to apelin treatment [24]. Our latest work revealed that ACE2 represents a major negative regulator of apelin in the vasculature and heart. ACE2 potentiated the degradation of pyr-apelin 13 and apelin 17 through cleavage of their C-terminal phenylalanine (Fig. 1), thereby producing pyr-apelin 12 and apelin 16 whose cardioprotective effects were negligible [20]. This observation was previously confirmed using synthetic C-terminally truncated apelin peptides in stably transfected CHO cell lines expressing the rat apelin receptor [25]. Sequential removal of the last three amino acids of apelin 17 showed equivalent receptor binding and comparable cAMP inhibition, exhibited a dramatic reduction in receptor internalization [25]. Computational modeling predicted a key pi-stacking interaction between the C-terminal phenylalanine with aromatic residues within the apelin receptor [26]. Disruption of this hydrophobic interaction via synthetic truncation [26–28], alanine substitution [26,29], or site-directed mutagenesis of receptor aromatic residues [26] significantly decreased receptor internalization and downstream cardioprotective effects. Therefore the C-terminus of apelin isoforms is essential for the full agonistic activity of the apelinergic system [27]. N-terminal truncation of apelin isoforms has minimal impact on receptor binding and corresponding physiological activity until the conserved C-terminal 12 amino acid core is disturbed [30]. Removal of any of the amino acids within the ‘RPRL’ motif completely abolishes receptor binding via disruption of the key electrostatic interactions with the apelin receptor [28,31]. Most recently, the metalloprotease neprilysin (NEP), a target for Entresto™ used in treatment of HF, was identified as an enzyme that degrades and inactivates apelin peptides via proteolysis within this region (Fig. 1). This new discovery contributes to our understanding of the mechanisms of NEP inhibition and the apelin/apelin receptor system in cardiovascular physiology and disease [32].

### 2.2. Mechanism of action

Apelin underlies a dual action in both animal and human tissues depending on the presence of an intact endothelium [33]. The net effects of the apelin/apelin receptor signaling in the intact endothelium are vasodilation. In contrast, vasoconstriction prevailed after damage of the vascular endothelium [13]. The hypotensive action of apelin has been demonstrated in healthy rats, to which intravenous injection of apelin leads to immediate lowering of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure [34]. In hypertensive rats, treatment with apelin has been shown to lower systolic blood pressure levels via a nitric oxide (NO)-dependent signaling [35,36]. Given the elevated expression during the formation of the retinal vessels, endogenous apelin is required for normal vascular development that is fueled by induced endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) phosphorylation (Table 1 & Fig. 2) [37,38]. Consistent with this, apelin 13 stimulates angiogenesis by potentiating the interaction between adenosine monophosphate activated protein kinase (AMPK) and Akt signaling in myocardial microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) (Table 2 & Fig. 2) [39]. The apelin receptor and neurotensin receptor 1 (NTSR1) can form a functional heterodimer which enhances activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling and proliferation in human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC), providing a new potential pharmaceutical target for cardiovascular disease [40].

ACE2 potentiates the degradation of pyr-apelin 13, apelin-13, -17 and -36 through cleavage of their C-terminal phenylalanine, subsequently producing pyr-apelin 12, apelin-12, -16 and -35, respectively. Neprilysin degrades apelin at the conserved C-terminal 12 amino acids, abrogating the binding of apelin to its receptor. ACE2, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; NEP: neprilysin.

### 2.3. Physiological effects

The apelin/apelin receptor system is widely distributed in the cardiovascular system, and its mechanistic links to vascular homeostasis, angiogenesis, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, myocardial infarction and HF have been well documented \[[12,14,41,42]\]. The involvement of apelin in cardiac development and differentiation of embryonic stem cells along cardiac lineage were investigated in frog, mice and human, respectively \[[43,44]\]. Vessel maturation is complex and is dependent on apelin action since both apelin 13 and 36 promote the assembly and proliferation of endothelial cells \[[45]\]. Insights gained from knockout models of apelin or apelin receptor indicate that the apelin/apelin receptor system is not only important for normal cardiovascular development, but also is indispensable for appropriate responses to pathological conditions \[[8]\]. The apelin pathway provides important beneficial effects in the cardiovascular system under pathological conditions due to its ability to regulate cardiovascular function such as blood pressure, cardiac contractility and fluid balance \[[46–48]\]. However, effects of apelin can be species dependent as seen in healthy sheep where large doses of apelin triggered an initial decrease in blood pressure followed by a hypertensive response and activation of neurohormones \[[49]\].

There is growing evidence to support an important interplay between the Ang II/AT1 receptor and the apelin/apelin receptor system. Intriguingly, the amino acidic compositions of pre-pro-apelin and the apelin receptor are similar to those of Ang II and the AT1 receptor, respectively. There is 54% sequence homology of the transmembrane regions between the apelin receptor and AT1 receptor, and the anatomical distribution of both receptors and peptides overlaps in the cardiovascular system \[[1]\]. Nonetheless, Ang II does not bind to the apelin receptor, nor does apelin bind to the AT1 receptor. \[[1,2,50]\]. Ang II plays a central role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and apelin is an antagonist of Ang II through apelin-dependent heterodimerization and apelin receptor-mediated negative allosteric modulation of AT1 function (Fig. 2) \[[51]\]. The physical interaction between APJ and AT1 has significant consequences for AT1 function and pharmacology. APJ and AT1 receptors heterodimerization critically regulates the Ang II/AT1 receptor signaling. Importantly, apelin-mediated upregulation of ACE2 is a key mechanism to inhibit the RAS \[[24,52]\]. Apelin treatment attenuates the vasoconstrictor response to Ang II in rabbit aorta, whereas apelin receptor-deficiency enhances the vasopressor response to Ang II in mice \[[53,54]\]. Apelin receptor/AT1 receptor double knockout mice have elevated baseline blood pressure compared with the AT1 receptor-deficient mice, suggesting that apelin receptor activation opposes the Ang II/AT1 signaling (Table 2) \[[54]\]. The myocardial levels of apelin/apelin receptor were significantly reduced in the Ang II-induced hypertensive mice which were strikingly reversed by administration of the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) \[[55]\].

### 3. Role of apelin in heart disease

Both apelin and apelin receptor null mice manifested moderate reduction in cardiac contractile function under basal conditions and their exercise capacity was markedly reduced (Table 1) \[[56]\]. Apelin has direct effects on the propagation of action potential and contractility in cardiomyocytes, and the mechanisms involved in the inotropic effects may be associated with increased myofilament sensitivity to Ca²⁺ (Table 1) \[[57]\]. Pre-treatment of cardiac fibroblasts with apelin-13 inhibits Ang II-induced collagen production and activation of both connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) and transforming growth

with an important role of the apelin pathway in the cardiac hypertrophic response [61].

Heart failure is common and carries high morbidity and mortality [62]. Improved understanding and treatment of HF has resulted in significant improvement in outcomes over the past two decades [63]. Aged apelin mutant mice developed progressive impairment of myocardial contractility along with systolic dysfunction, and loss of apelin contributed to HF in response to pressure-overload (Table 1) [64]. Reduction of the apelin/apelin receptor in the heart and aorta aggravates pathophysiological responses to hypertension and HF in the two-kidney, one-clip (2K1C) hypertensive rats (Table 1) [65]. The systolic and diastolic function was dramatically improved following infusion of pyr-apelin 13 in hypertensive rats with HF (Table 1) [66]. Administration of pyr-apelin 13 to Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats with end-stage HF leads to inhibition of cardiac dysfunction and cardiovascular remodeling, accompanied by decreased expression of inflammation factors such as tumor necrosis factor-α, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 and interleukin (IL)-1β [67]. Apelin-mediated activation of PKCε and ERK1/2 was responsible for enhancement of cardiac contractility with myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) being the downstream target (Table 1) [68]. While cardiomyocyte-specific apelin receptor overexpression in mice leads to cardiac hypertrophy and contractile dysfunction, pregnancy exacerbated this phenotype resulting in HF, suggesting that excessive activation of the apelin receptor may contribute towards post-partum cardiomyopathy (Table 1) [69]. Basal blood pressure is unaltered in apelin receptor-deficient mice. However, exogenous apelin lowers blood pressure in rodents, which was abrogated in apelin receptor-deficient mice [54]. These effects are paralleled in humans in whom apelin peptides induce peripheral and coronary vasodilation while increasing cardiac output and contractility [42]. Importantly, both the local vascular and systemic hemodynamic responses to apelin are preserved in patients with stable symptomatic chronic heart failure, maintained on contemporary medical therapy [42,70]. Importantly, both the local vascular and systemic hemodynamic responses to apelin are preserved in patients with stable symptomatic chronic heart failure [42,70]. Circulating apelin levels are reduced in patients with essential hypertension, and lower plasma apelin level is independently associated with more profound left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction, indicating that apelin may serve as a marker predicting an increased risk of HF (Table 1) [63,71]. Obese patients with higher left ventricular ejection fraction have greater levels of

factor-β (TGF-β) (Table 1 & Fig. 2) [58]. Apelin attenuates the osteoblastic differentiation of human aortic valve interstitial cells, suggesting that loss of apelin action promotes valvular heart disease (Table 1) [59]. Chronic infusion of apelin 13 into the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) resulted in increased myocardial atrial natriuretic peptide and β-myosin heavy chain mRNA expression, both of which potentiated cardiac hypertrophy (Table 1), indicating the potential linkage between PVN apelin and hypertension (Table 1) [60]. Hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) display lower serum apelin levels compared with patients without LVH, consistent

plasma apelin than non-obese patients, and in an obese murine model  
of ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury, apelin prevents nuclear translocation of FoxO3 in response to oxygen deprivation, providing insights into its potential clinical relevance in obese patients with HF [72]. Reduced plasma and myocardial apelin levels in patients with advanced HF with concomitant reduction in expression of the apelin receptor clearly suggest that the apelin system is compromised in HF [73,74]. However, in contrast with these findings and compared with the healthy controls, no significant difference in plasma apelin levels were noted in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [63]. The discrepancies among these studies need to be clarified but may be related to the quality of the apelin peptide assays. The mechanism leading to the attenuation of apelin/apelin receptor system in HF may involve Ang II-induced downregulation of the synthesis and release of apelin. Indeed, genetic deletion of apelin in mice leads to cardiac dysfunction, which is abrogated by treatment with AT1 receptor blockade or by AT1 receptor knockout [24].

Plasma apelin levels predict the major cardiovascular event after percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), and adverse events are higher in patients with lower plasma apelin levels [75]. Apelin and its receptor are markedly upregulated in the heart and skeletal muscle following myocardial injury or systemic hypoxic exposure through a hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-mediated pathway. Moreover, healthy-control rats exposed to hypoxic conditions also have exhibited elevated expression of the apelin/apelin receptor signaling in myocardium, pulmonary circulation and skeletal muscle [76]. Under stressful conditions, plasma corticosterone levels and cardiac apelin expression are upregulated, thereby contributing to inhibition of stress-induced apoptosis in the heart [77]. In mice fed with a high-fat diet and subjected to myocardial I/R, apelin 13 administration significantly alleviated infarct size, myocardial apoptosis and mitochondrial damage (Table 1) [78]. Apelin gene therapy increases vascular density and alleviates diabetic cardiomyopathy by a mechanism involving activation of Sirt3 and upregulation of VEGF/VEGFR2 expression (Table 1) [79,80]. These observations provide a novel mechanism with Sirt3 being essential for apelin-induced angiogenesis in diabetes following myocardial infarction [81]. Apelin-mediated protection against cardiac fibrosis results primarily from direct modulation of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 gene expression, associated with synergistic inhibition of Ang II signaling and increased production of -NO (Fig. 2) [82]. In cultured primary cardiomyocytes under hypoxia/re-oxygenation, administration of apelin suppresses apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species. In addition, apelin improves cardiac dysfunction after myocardial I/R injury by inhibiting myocardial apoptosis and oxidative stress, along with upregulation of eNOS levels and of PI3K/Akt and activation of ERK1/2 phosphorylation signaling (Table 1 & Fig. 2) [83]. Genetic ablation of apelin leads to aggravated left ventricular injury following MI, while a synthetic apelin analogue, which mimics the function of apelin, markedly protects from myocardial I/R injury. This is accompanied by greater activation of survival pathways and promotion of angiogenesis (Table 1) [4]. Intracellular Ca²⁺ abnormality and endoplasmic reticulum stress mediates cardiac dysfunction induced by myocardial I/R injury, and apelin 13 suppresses these pathogenic pathways [84–86]. The expression of apelin/apelin receptor in human endothelial cells is associated with shear stress, in which expression of apelin receptor is induced independently of its ligand apelin [87]. The recent findings broadened our view of the apelin/apelin receptor system by demonstrating that stretch-dependent apelin receptor signaling, rather than apelin receptor binding, contributed to increased cardiomyocyte cell size and myocardial hypertrophy [88]. Since the apelin receptor acts as a dual receptor for both mechanical stretch and endogenous apelin in cardiac hypertrophy, interventions targeting to balance these stimuli may determine the resulting adaptive physiology of apelin receptor [88].

4. Role of apelin in vascular disease

Apelin is an arterial and venous dilator in conscious rats [89], and acute apelin infusion causes peripheral and coronary vasodilation with increased cardiac output without cardiac hypertrophy (Table 2) [42,48]. This is attributed to stimulated NOS activity and expression (Table 2) [19,90]. Apelin 13 can inhibit Ang II induced contractions by a nitric oxide-dependent mechanism on either endothelium intact or endothelium denuded rat portal vein rings [91]. In contrast, injection of pyr-apelin 13 (20 and 50 nmol) intracerebroventricularly resulted in dose-dependent increases in mean arterial pressure and heart rate, suggesting that the peripheral and central actions of apelin can be distinct (Table 2) [92]. The NO signaling pathway is an important mechanism to regulate platelet activation which is known to contribute to thrombotic events leading to acute coronary syndromes and strokes [93,94]. Apelin plays a critical role in the regulation of platelet activation. Apelin-deficient mice display a prothrombotic profile, suggesting a potential role of apelin in thrombotic disorders (Table 2) [93]. Tissue factor plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndromes by triggering the formation of thrombi following endothelial injury. Apelin 13 functions as an active mediator in athero-thrombotic disease by suppressing the expression of tissue factor [95]. Thus, the development of promising strategies to interfere with Apelin/apelin receptor system and Apelin analogues might be a promising field for the therapeutic approach in thrombotic disease.

Atherosclerosis is a chronic lipid metabolism disorder linked with lipid accumulation within the arterial wall and subsequent formation of foam cells and vascular disease [96,97]. The level of apelin is decreased in human atherosclerotic coronary arteries [4], and coronary collateral formation in patients with stable angina correlates with higher plasma apelin levels [98]. Apelin 13 decreases lipid accumulation of foam cells and induces autophagy via activation of the PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway (Table 2) [99]. Apelin antagonizes Ang II-induced atherosclerosis and aneurysm in ApoE knockout mice by increasing NO production and suppressing neointimal formation and vascular remodeling (Table 2) [100]. Apelin null mice exhibit decreased smooth muscle positive area in the neointima compared with wild-type mice, while upregulation of the apelin/apelin receptor pathway promotes neointima formation in the carotid ligation model in mice (Table 2) [101]. Cell-based therapy using mesenchymal stem cells provides a promising approach for the management of peripheral arterial disease. Apelin facilitated mesenchymal stem cell-based therapy in peripheral arterial disease through promoting protective autophagy, accompanied with activation of AMPK and inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (Table 2 & Fig. 2) [102].

Increased pulmonary arterial pressure and vascular resistance are hallmarks of PAH, which contribute to right ventricular hypertrophy and failure [103]. Circulating levels of apelin and apelin expression are reduced in both pulmonary arterial endothelial cells (PAECs) and microvascular endothelial cells in patients with PAH (Table 2) [41,104,105]. Enhancing apelin action is a therapeutically viable option for PAH [106]. Deletion of apelin leads to worsened vascular remodeling associated with exacerbated pulmonary hypertension by decreased activation of AMPK and eNOS (Table 2 & Fig. 2) [107]. Chronic treatment with pyrapelin 13 significantly prevented PAH-induced downregulation of apelin/apelin receptor and activation of vasoconstrictors (Table 2) [108]. Deletion of apelin in PAECs led to augmented apoptosis and elevated proliferation of pulmonary arterial SMC, while administration of apelin remarkably reversed PAH in mice by rescuing BMPR2 and PAECs dysfunction [41]. Exogenous apelin decreased the level of pulmonary arterial SMC autophagy, proliferation and migration under hypoxia via activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway (Table 2 & Fig. 2) [109]. Apelin dependent miRNA-fibroblast growth factor signaling is also essential for pulmonary vascular homeostasis [105]. Given the diverse function of apelin peptides in vascular homeostasis, measures

targeting the enhancement of the apelin pathway may provide a basis for novel anti-hypertensive and anti-atherosclerotic therapies.

## 5. Targeting the apelin pathway as novel therapies for cardiovascular diseases

### 5.1. Use of apelin receptor agonists

The *Apela/Elabela/Toddler* gene which encodes a 32 amino acid peptide Elabela was recently discovered and has been shown to bind to the apelin receptor. *Apela*-deficiency resulting in aberrant cardiac development has added a new dimension to the apelin system [10,110]. The discovery of apelin receptor agonist Elabela gives rise to the intriguing prospect of adjusting apelin/apelin receptor system in cardiovascular disorders. *Apela* is expressed in the adult heart and increases cardiac contractility in an ERK-dependent manner. The expression of *Apela* and apelin is induced in the failing heart and correlates with left ventricular ejection fraction (Fig. 2) [9]. Toddler triggers zebrafish gastrulation by activating the apelin receptor signaling, showing the discrepancies between the roles of apelin/apelin receptor in mouse and zebrafish [25,110]. Elabela induces angiogenesis and relaxes mouse aortic blood vessel in a dose-dependent manner through a mechanism different from apelin. The Elabela-apelin receptor pathway may participate in regulating circulation system as well as embryonic development [111].

Although less explored than the peptide analogues, the first non-peptide agonist of the apelin receptor was reported in 2010, with binding and functional activities in the high nM range [26]. This fluorescent peptidomimetic molecule was later found to be a mixture of several components varying in methylation states, and subsequent structure-activity relationship studies on the purified lead compound improved the potency, plasma stability, and GPCR selectivity [112]. Generally, chronic administration of an agonist will lead to receptor desensitization accompanied by β-arrestin mediated loss of therapeutic potency. Given the limitation in translating lead compounds to clinical applications, investigators have identified and developed biased and non-biased agonists toward G-protein coupled receptor signaling [26,112]. Combinatorial screening of the NIH small molecule library has identified a full non-peptide apelin receptor agonist, ML233, with low μM activity at inhibiting cAMP accumulation and β-arrestin activation [113]. Additional agonists possessing benzimidazole [114] and pyrazole [115] scaffolds have been reported to show sub-micromolar activity.

### 5.2. Use of apelin analogues

Due to the rapid *in vivo* degradation and poor pharmacological properties of native apelin peptides, there is considerable need to develop synthetic apelin receptor agonists for therapeutics and to further our understanding of this peptide hormone in human physiology [8,116]. Within the conserved C-terminal core of apelin isoforms, key amino acid residues essential for physiological activity have been identified using alanine-scans [30,117], D-amino acid substitutions [118], and truncation analyses [28,30]. These studies, along with conformational analyses [119,120] and interaction studies with the receptor [31], have validated the ‘RPRL’ and ‘KGPM’ regions as necessary sequences for receptor binding and physiological efficacy. However, these regions have also been highlighted as key locations of protease degradation through *in vitro* and *in vivo* plasma incubation studies [121,122]. Two main aims have been targeted when designing and evaluating apelin peptide analogues. One is enhancing the ability of agonists to bind stronger to the GPCR receptor and activate specific downstream intracellular pathways; whereas another is generating analogues with improved proteolytic stability. The C-terminal phenylalanine (Phe) in apelin isoforms has a key role in biasing the agonism of the apelinergic system [27,123]. Marsault and coworkers have modified this residue to various non-canonical amino acids to generate biased receptor agonists [124]. Compared to native pyr-apelin-13, substitution with O-benzyl-L-tyrosine generated an apelin analogue with improved receptor-binding and hypotensive effects. However, replacement with either α-Me-L-Phe or 4-benzoyl-L-Phe showed a 30-fold decrease in cAMP accumulation [124]. Cyclization of the apelin peptide, through either the amide backbone or amino acid side chains, has also been a commonly employed strategy to produce biased agonists of the apelin receptor [120,125–127]. Such macrocyclic apelin analogues unfortunately seem to have significantly reduced receptor binding, plasma half-lives, or are lacking key physiological activities compared to their linear isoforms. However, cyclic MM07 has been utilized successfully in patients, eliciting reproducible vasodilation without losing efficacy after multiple doses [125]. Apelin peptides have been conjugated to larger polyethylene glycol scaffolds [128] and fatty acids [129] to produce analogues with improved pharmacokinetic properties.

Our knowledge regarding the physiological regulation of apelin has been dominated by the discovery of its *in vitro* susceptibility to monocarboxypeptidase ACE2 [21]. Stable apelin analogues resistant to ACE2-mediated degradation were designed and synthesized, confirming its possibility to be designed as a potential drug [20]. A large number of peptide analogues with amino acid replacements surrounding the Pro-Phe ACE2 cleavage site have been synthesized and tested for receptor binding, functional assays, and plasma stability [118]. We have combined select individual Pro and Phe substitutions into apelin analogues that show resistance to *in vitro* ACE2 proteolysis after 48 h incubation time [4]. One ACE2 resistant analogue (Nle11,Aib12,4-BrPhe-13 pyr-apelin-13) showed a more pronounced and prolonged hypotensive effect and ability to prevent myocardial ischemic reperfusion injury compared to native pyr-apelin-13 [4]. Other research groups have eliminated the ACE2 cleavage site altogether to produce biased agonists lacking this site of proteolysis [122]. This strategy effectively generated a decapeptide amide with comparable efficacy to native pyr-apelin-13 but with significantly diminished plasma stability via proteolysis at new locations [122]. However, apelin is also degraded at positions other than the C-terminus [121,122]. We recently demonstrated that NEP degrades apelin peptides *in vitro* within the essential ‘RPRL’ receptor binding motif [32] and are currently investigating synthetic analogues with improved NEP stability. A fragment of Elabela, an endogenous analogue of apelin, was recently shown to bind to the apelin receptor and induce receptor internalization, thereby leading to anti-hypertensive effect and positive inotropic effects. This highlights the potential of creating Elabela analogues as therapeutic agents for cardiovascular diseases [130].

## 6. Conclusions

Cardiovascular disease is a leading health problem that encompasses a broad range of disorders including atherosclerosis, hypertension, myocardial infarction and HF. Enormous effort has been invested in understanding the physiological effects of apelin/apelin receptor signaling pathway. The importance of the apelin/apelin receptor axis in the cardiovascular system sparked hopes that manipulating its physiological activity could provide novel therapeutic agents. In fact, the clinical and experimental studies clearly support a physiological and pathophysiological role for the apelin system in cardiovascular diseases, and enhancing the apelin pathway has beneficial effects against heart and vascular diseases. Targeting the apelin/apelin receptor pathway represents a novel therapeutic approach against cardiovascular diseases that will increase our understanding of the pathophysiology of these diseases.
