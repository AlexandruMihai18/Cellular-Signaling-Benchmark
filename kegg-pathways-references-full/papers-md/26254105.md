Abstract

Apelin is a peptide known to have a vital role in cardiovascular diseases. It has been proven to induce proliferation and tube formation in endothelial cells, stabilise contacts between endothelial cells, and mediate pericyte recruitment. Since apelin level is reduced early after myocardial infarction, a supportive therapy with apelin is being investigated for its beneficial effect on blood vessel formation. It is becoming apparent, however, that the final effect of apelin often depends on stimuli the cell receives and the cross-talk with other molecules inside the cell. Hence, understanding the apelin pathway potentially can help us to improve angiogenic therapy. This review summarises recent knowledge regarding molecules involved in apelin signalling while focusing on their roles in angiogenesis within the ischemic environment after myocardial infarction.

# 1. Introduction

Angiogenesis is impaired in many diseases, such as myocardial infarction (MI), atherosclerosis and diabetes. Understanding the pathways of angiogenesis helps us to find new therapeutics or improve already established methods for restoring blood flow. Since the first angiogenic factors were purified in the 1980s, many new factors connected to angiogenic pathways have been discovered. To name just a few, these include vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) [1-3].

In relation to acute MI, pro-angiogenic therapy has emerged as having promising potential in cardiac repair [4-6]. Nevertheless, recovery of cardiac function in acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients is not always satisfactory [7]. It appears that delivery of a single growth factor or cell type is not sufficient for long-term cardiac repair. New strategies are therefore being investigated, including co-delivery of endothelial progenitor cells and vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs) [8], pre-conditioning of transplanted cells [9], and application of genetically modified stem cells [10, 11].

A combined gene therapy using several growth factors appears to be more efficient than is delivery of a single growth factor [12, 13]. This approach is based on the multi-step process of angiogenesis regulated *in vivo* by several angiogenic factors [14]. Importantly, overexpression of a single pro-angiogenic factor may induce pathologic blood vessel formation and even lead to formation of vascular tumours [15]. Accordingly, emphasis is given to regulating stabilisation and maturation processes together with preserving a balance of pro-angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. New modifications and regulators of angiogenic therapy are being tested to further improve therapy [16, 17]. One of the angiogenesis regulators intensively studied in recent years is apelin, which has been found to play an important role in blood vessel formation [17-21]. This review discusses how apelin and other molecules involved in the apelin pathway influence angiogenesis while focusing on those molecules' roles in ischemia after AMI.

# 2. Apelin isoforms and distribution

Apelin is a peptide first identified in its 36-amino acid isoform in 1998 in bovine stomach extracts [22]. It binds to a G-protein-coupled angiotensin II protein J (APJ) receptor [22, 23]. Several active isoforms of apelin have been identified to date. The isoforms are produced by cleavage of 77-amino acid pre-proapelin [24], bind to APJ receptor, and cause similar cellular effects [25]. However, shorter peptides consisting of 13 to 17 amino acids have higher activity than does apelin-36 [22, 26]. In human heart, apelin-13 is the predominant isoform, while in plasma apelin-13 and apelin-17 can be found [27-29].

Since its first identification, the apelin/APJ pathway has been described to be active in various cells, tissues and organs (including heart, brain, lung, kidney, endothelium, plasma, and adipose tissue) [22, 26, 30]. In the vascular system, apelin and APJ receptor are expressed by endothelial and smooth muscle cells [17, 31, 32].

# 3. Apelin in endothelial cells of sprouting vessels

Vessel sprouting during angiogenesis is co-ordinated by signals from nearby tissue and the vessels themselves [33, 34]. However, the responses of individual endothelial cells to the signals differ according to their positions in the vessels. Tip cells are specialised endothelial cells (ECs), localised at the leading edge of the vessels, which secrete cytokines, extend filopodia, and lead the migration in response to VEGF gradient [34]. The lumen of new vessels, by contrast, is formed of stalk cells which

also secrete various factors [34]. Both tip and stalk cells express apelin, whereas APJ receptor is located on stalk cells only [35]. Surprisingly, APJ is little expressed in unstimulated ECs, but it is abundantly expressed under hypoxia and after stimulation with VEGF [36-38]. Although under normal conditions APJ receptor can be found mostly in the cell membrane, the receptor moves into the cytoplasm after stimulation with apelin [38].

## 4. Angiogenesis in ischemic tissue and apelin signalling

Hypoxia and the need for restoration of insufficient blood supply trigger angiogenesis in ischemic tissue. After VEGF stimulation, endothelial cells differentiate, proliferate, release platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF-BB), and attract mural cells (pericytes or smooth muscle cells) to newly formed blood vessels [39]. In the following phase, the pre-existing vessels are stabilised by mural cells releasing angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), thereby activating tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie-2 on ECs and consequently stabilising intracellular junctions [40, 41].

Apelin plays an essential role in blood vessel formation and ischemia repair [42, 43]. It has been described as vital for all the steps of angiogenesis, upregulating both migration and tube formation [17] and having beneficial effect on stabilisation of contacts between endothelial cells generating non-leaky blood vessels [18]. Similarly, APJ receptor is necessary also for functional angiogenesis. In knockout mice that were APJ-/-, it has been observed that the blood vessels did not form appropriately and vascular smooth muscle cell layers were decreased even though the level of CD31 endothelial cells was preserved [44].

Hypoxia induces expression of APJ receptor on endothelial cells. This process leads to activation of apelin pathway [45]. In the next step, apelin produced by tip cells binds to APJ receptor on stalk cells and stimulates downstream signalling pathways in ECs [35].

To date, a rather large number of signalling molecules have been reported to be implicated in the apelin pathway during angiogenesis, both affecting apelin expression and acting downstream of apelin/APJ signalling. We discuss here the signalling networks and role of the molecules in ischemic tissue.

## 5. Apelin pathway and cross-talking signalling molecules

### 5.1 Hypoxia-inducible factor

The key step at the beginning of the apelin pathway is hypoxia. Hypoxia is regulated by hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1), which promotes the expression of genes containing hypoxia-responsive elements (HREs) [46]. In 2006, HREs were found in the apelin promoter, albeit without confirmed functionality [47]. One year later, it was demonstrated that apelin can be upregulated in response to hypoxia in cardiac tissue [48]. Finally, in 2008 it was shown that apelin expression in endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells is mediated by the binding of HIF-1 to an HRE located within the first intron of apelin [49]. (Figure 1) Under hypoxia, apelin induces the proliferation of endothelial cells independently of the VEGF/VEGF-receptor signalling pathway [45].

### 5.2 Bone morphogenetic proteins

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), a subgroup of transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β), have emerged as critical regulators of vascular development [50, 51]. Recently, apelin has been shown to be strongly downregulated by BMP signalling (BMP4, BMP7, BMP9, BMP10) in endothelial cells [52-54]. This inhibition occurs via BMPR-2 receptor and the SMAD pathway [52]. It has been demonstrated that BMPR-2 receptor together with activin receptor-like kinase 1 (ALK-1) activate

SMAD1,5,8 signalling after BMP9 stimulation and that SMAD4 is also vital for the inhibition of apelin expression [54]. This signalling pathway is connected with Notch signalling since SMAD signalling induces expression of Notch transcription factors hairy and enhancer of split-1 (HES1), as well as of hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif proteins 1 and 2 (HEY1 and HEY2). It also co-operates with activated Notch on induction of the genes [54]. Hence, ALK signalling co-operates with Notch signalling (delta-like ligand 4, DLL4) to inhibit apelin, thereby inducing expression of the vascular guidance receptor unc-5 homolog B (UNC5B) and of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR1) [54]. BMPs also reduce hypoxia-induced apelin expression and endothelial cell proliferation [52]. In another study, by contrast, BMP-2 was described as regulating expression of apelin in pulmonary arterial ECs by formation of a transcriptional complex between peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARγ) and β-catenin and consequently promoting endothelial cell survival, proliferation and migration [55]. The PPARγ/β-catenin pathway seems to be SMAD independent [56]. (Figure 1). These discrepancies in BMP effect on apelin can be attributed to several factors. The first factor relates to extracellular regulators of BMP, namely BMP endothelial cell precursor-derived regulator (BMPER), gremlin and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-stimulated gene (TSG), which can promote angiogenesis depending on their concentrations [57, 58]. The second factor consists in interplay of the BMP signalling pathway with other proteins from the cross-talking signalling pathways. The last but not negligible factor might relate to the cell type or culture conditions.

### 5.3 Angiopoietin/tyrosine-protein kinase receptor signalling

Tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Tie-2, a receptor for angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), plays an important role in maturation of blood vessels inducing cell adhesion between mural cells and endothelial cells [59]. Ang-1 also is capable of pericyte recruitment [60]. Angiopoietin-2, on the other hand, competes with Ang-1, destabilises the vessels [61], and reduces pericyte recruitment [60]. In addition to being produced by mural cells, Ang-1 can be made by hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells that are found in the perivascular region during angiogenesis [62]. Ang-1 binding to its receptor Tie-2 on endothelial cells induces apelin production [36] (Figure 1). Interestingly, a feedback loop of apelin stimulating Ang-1 expression has been reported recently in endothelial cells [21] (Figure 2). Ang-1 co-delivered with apelin leads to high maturation of vessels, but it does not increase capillary growth [60].

### 5.4 Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1

Monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1/CCL2) promotes migration and activation of monocytes and macrophages [63]. MCP-1 affects angiogenesis, too, either by trafficking of monocytes into a damaged area [64] or by acting directly on ECs [65]. MCP-1 binds to C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and pericytes [19]. MCP-1 is known to be regulated by nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) [66] and SMAD transcription factors [67]. In mural cells, MCP-1 is implicated in proliferation and its expression is induced by Ang-1 [68]. Apelin appears also to regulate MCP-1, but there are controversial findings with regard to apelin’s effect on MCP-1 expression in endothelial cells. In a recent study, silencing of apelin with siRNA led to upregulated MCP-1 expression in mouse brain endothelioma cells (bEnd.3) and this was achieved via the suppression of Akt phosphorylation followed by SMAD3 phosphorylation [19]. Similarly, apelin down regulates MCP-1 expression in macrophages [69]. Via the MCP-1 signalling pathway, apelin also represses vascular smooth muscle cell migration and pericyte recruitment [19]. Other studies, however, bring different results. In a mouse model study of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization, apelin had no effect on the level of MCP-1 expression in either an apelin-knocked-out mouse or in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) [70]. Lu et
al. [71] found apelin to have the opposite effect on MCP-1, stimulating its expression and secretion in HUVECs via c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase (JNK) and NF-κB. JNK [72, 73] and NF-κB [73] have been described to stimulate MCP-1 in other cells, too (Figure 2). Hence, further research will be needed to reconcile these data, as there can be other factors downstream of apelin/APJ signalling which affect the induction of MCP-1 expression.

### 5.5 Akt/mTOR/p70S6K and ERK signalling pathway

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the PI3 kinase/Akt pathway, vital for the control of cell differentiation, also are known to induce angiogenic differentiation in endothelial cells [74]. Stimulation of these pathways has recently been investigated also in relation to therapeutic angiogenesis [75]. Apelin has been found to be an upstream regulator of the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/p70S6K and extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERKs) pathways. In HUVECs apelin induces cell proliferation after the phosphorylation of p706S kinase via ERK and PI3 kinase (PI3K) signalling [76], and in stalk cells the mTOR pathway was reported downstream of apelin [35]. In lymphatic endothelial cells, the phosphorylation of Erk1/2 and Akt stimulated by apelin has been shown to increase endothelial cell migration and tube formation capacity [77]. Hence, p706S seems to be a common target of both AKT/mTOR and ERK pathways (Figure 2). P706S has been reported in several other studies to have a central role in endothelial cell proliferation [78, 79], and it has been demonstrated also to regulate HIF-1α expression in human ECs [80].

### 5.6 Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase

Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase (AMPK) is activated by increased intracellular concentrations of adenosine monophosphate (AMP) [81], and in endothelial cells its activity is regulated by hypoxia [82], fluid shear stress, basic fibroblast growth factor [82], adiponectin [83] and VEGF [82]. Although AMPK is generally known to be involved in metabolic control, in endothelial cells it has been reported to be implicated in angiogenesis [82]. In HUVECs, AMPK is activated by hypoxia via phosphorylation at threonine-172 (Thr-172) [82]. A link between AMPK and apelin has recently been proven in myocardial microvascular endothelial cells, wherein apelin-13 stimulated the phosphorylation of AMP-activated protein kinase and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) at Thr-172 and serine-1179 (Ser-1179) [17] (Figure 2). A link between AMPK and apelin was reported also for energy metabolism in adipose tissue [84] and myocardium [85] while involving additional proteins, such as insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) [85]. IRS-1 suggests itself potentially to be involved in the apelin-AMPK pathway in ECs, as it had been described to be expressed in ECs [86] and has an ability to mediate angiogenic effects [87].

### 5.7 Myocyte enhancer factor 2

Myocyte enhancer factor 2 (MEF-2) is a transcription factor expressed in endothelial cells that plays a role in the cardiovascular system and affects EC proliferation and capillary tube formation [88]. MEF-2C, one of four existing MEF-2 transcripts, was found to have an inhibitory effect on sprouting by upregulating alpha-2-macroglobulin (A2M) [89]. It is suggested, however, that this inhibition is induced under normoxic conditions but not under hypoxia [89]. In contrast, MEF-2A activates EC proliferation and capillary tube formation via Gα13 [88]. As MEF-2 forms a complex with the transcriptional repressors, histone deacetylases (HDACs), phosphorylation of HDACs disrupts this interaction and activates MEF-2. One of the potent activators of MEF-2, which phosphorylates HDAC, is Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMK) [90]. Recently it has been demonstrated that MEF-2 (MEF-2A, MEF-2C) expression is also regulated by the apelin/APJ pathway [44] since APJ-/- mice were found to have significantly decreased MEF-2. Apelin-APJ regulates MEF-2 activation via G-
protein Ga13 and via phosphorylation of HDAC4 and HDAC5 and their transport from nucleus to cytoplasm (Figure 2). Ga13 is involved also in HDAC4/5 phosphorylation [44].

### 5.8 Krüppel-like factor 2 (KLF2)

The MEF-2 signalling pathway has been found to be connected with KLF-2, a zinc-finger transcription factor regulating vascular growth and endothelial function [91, 92]. KLF-2 has been reported to be vital for differentiation and angiogenesis of endothelial colony-forming cells [92]. In addition, KLF-2 regulates expression of the tight junction protein occludin in ECs, and therefore KLF-2 deficiency causes endothelial leakage [93]. KLF-2 is regulated by apelin [94, 95] via the AMP-activated protein kinase/MEF2 pathway [92, 94] (Figure 2). Recently HDAC5 has been reported to repress KLF-2 in HUVECs by direct binding in the nucleus [96]. Moreover, HDAC5 can also repress MEF-2 [97]. After its phosphorylation, however, HDAC5 is exported from the nucleus and MEF-2 can activate KLF-2 expression [97].

### 6. Apelin/APJ expression in pericytes and smooth muscle cells

Pericytes and smooth muscle cells are essential for the maturation of newly formed vessels. VSMCs express APJ receptor [98] but do not produce apelin [99]. Apelin has been shown to mediate pericyte recruitment [60]. Furthermore, apelin has been found to stimulate vascular SMC proliferation by two distinct signalling pathways. The first described pathway acts via Jagged-1/Notch3 and Cyclin D1 and has been reported to be dependent on apelin-13 concentration [100]. In the other pathway, apelin-13 stimulates proliferation and migration of VSMCs by early growth response-1 (Egr-1) transcription factor up-regulation [101]. Both pathways can be abolished by ERK inhibitors, thus suggesting their cross-talk [100, 101]. Apelin also has been found to stimulate migration and proliferation of neointimal SMCs in mice after carotid artery ligation [102]. Under high glucose level conditions, interestingly, apelin acts distinctly on pericyte recruitment [19]. Apelin knockdown in ECs in a murine model of pathological retinal angiogenesis up-regulated MCP-1 expression in stalk cells and resulted in the release of pericyte recruitment factor from endothelial cells. This MCP-1-mediated pericyte recruitment was transduced via PI3-AkT and Smad3 pathway [19].

### 7. The role of apelin in monocytes/macrophages

Myocardial infarction triggers recruitment of monocytes to the damaged heart, where they differentiate to become macrophages. These cells perform various functions after MI, including removing damaged extracellular matrix and dying cardiac cells, releasing inflammatory mediators, and promote angiogenesis by releasing growth factors, cytokines and metalloproteinases [103, 104]. Interestingly, macrophages have been observed to be able to carve out tunnels in the extracellular matrix mediating angiogenesis [105]. It is generally considered that these antagonistic roles are performed by two distinct subsets of monocytes which were identified for the first time in 1989 [Passlick et al., 1989]. Most of the monocytes/macrophages are CD14<sup>high</sup>CD16<sup>low/negative</sup>. These are assumed to be active in the first four days after MI, when they release inflammatory cytokines. The minority subset is CD14<sup>low</sup>CD16<sup>high</sup> [106, 107] and has reparative function, releasing anti-inflammatory cytokines from day 4 after MI [108]. Although macrophages had previously not been proven to express the APJ receptor [109], studies from recent years have yielded findings to the contrary [69, 110]. In murine models, apelin has been shown to inhibit monocyte recruitment in abdominal aorta [69] and in kidney during diabetic nephropathy [111]. However, apelin has been reported to promote monocyte adhesion to HUVECs via VCAM-1 [112]. Apelin has been found also to induce lower production of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages (IL-6, IL-8 MIP-1α, M-CSF) and to reduce MCP-1 and TNF-α production [69]. Apelin-mediated inhibition of MCP-1 and IL-8 production has been reported also in peritoneal macrophages [113]. In view of the fact that there exist two

monocyte/macrophage subpopulations, we might assume that the CD16<sup>high</sup> subset, active later after MI, expresses a higher level of APJ receptor after hypoxia stimulation and hence responds to apelin more effectively. This in effect leads to a reduction of inflammatory cytokines and promotes pro-angiogenic behaviour of the monocytes/macrophages in the later phase after MI. (Figure 3)

8. Apelin in acute myocardial infarction and its therapeutic potential

8.1 From animal models to human studies

Plasma level of apelin after acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is lower than in healthy people or in patients with coronary artery disease [114]. Nevertheless, apelin concentration rises over time after AMI [115]. Additional apelin induction seems to improve blood vessel formation. Animal experiments help us to better understand the mechanisms and impact of apelin treatment, and at least partially predict its effect in human. Majority of *in vivo* experiments have been performed in rodents. Apelin is mostly administered intravenously (i.v.) or by intraperitoneal route (i.p.) [116, 117] in its pyroglutamated form [Pyr1]-apelin-13, and its dosage varied from nanomolar to micromolar concentrations per kilogram. Apelin treatment usually starts at day of surgery or several days before and continues up to 14 days after surgery [117]. Despite variances in protocols of apelin administration, most of the studies coincide on apelin ability to reduce fibrosis and increase cardiac contractility and capillary density. In recent study post-infarct treatment with [Pyr1]-apelin-13 for 5 days increased heart rate to the level of control group in comparison with MI rats without apelin [116]. However, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were not affected. Importantly, apelin reduced infarct size and increased nitric oxide (NO) level [116]. The same group also reported reduction of fibrosis and increased capillary density in myocardium after [Pyr1]-apelin-13 treatment in rats [118]. In mouse experiment, apelin-13 treatment post MI decreased fibrosis, the area of MI (assessed by the ratio of the infarcted area to left ventricle area) and increased capillary density and cardiac contractility [117]. There are rare reports on apelin administration in large animal models. In sheep, three different doses of apelin in i.v. bolus were compared, but only the highest dose of 1mg (equivalent of 20µg/kg) had significant impact on MAP and heart rate. However, these changes were short-term, with return to control level within 15-20 min. More importantly, atrioventricular block lasting 15 min was observed in several sheep [119]. Recently, escalating administration of apelin to dogs with heart failure for four hours has been studied. Dogs received apelin for two hours in low dose (500ng/kg/min) followed by two hours in high dose (50µg/kg/min). Apelin treatment improved left ventricle (LV) systolic function with no effect on heart rate [120].

Apelin carried by nanoparticles could represent novel therapeutic approach in AMI. Serpooshan et al. [121] have prepared liposomal particles with encapsulated [Pyr1]-apelin-13 and coated with polyethylene glycol (PEG) polymer. Apelin loaded nanoparticles were administered to mice after transverse aortic constriction with single injection a week for two weeks. At days 8 and 14 post-surgery cardiac contractility was significantly improved and hypertrophic remodelling was inhibited in comparison with control group treated only with saline. In contrast, administration of regular [Pyr1]-apelin-13 by intraperitoneal injection had lower effect on hypertrophic response. Also in heart sections, [Pyr1]-apelin-13 encapsulated in nanoparticles reduced fibrosis extent and left ventricle size more efficiently than regular [Pyr1]-apelin-13 [121]. Another possible way of AMI treatment with growth factors is gene transfer. Apelin gene transfer in the hind limb ischemia model has been shown to reduce necrosis, and the combination of apelin and VEGF gene therapy was even more effective [18]. While VEGF gene transfer alone increased the number of blood vessels, apelin was found to induce fewer but larger vessels. In the combination therapy, apelin inhibited VEGF-mediated leakiness of blood vessels [18]. Vascular leakage depends on VE-cadherin-mediated EC–EC junctions,

and it is known that VEGF stimulation leads to loss of VE-cadherin and destroys the junctions [122]. Apelin has been found to abolish the effect of VEGF on gap formation, but it does not affect cell junctions directly [18]. The molecular mechanism of this process is not yet clear, however, and possible cross-linking with the Ang-1 pathway has been suggested [18].

As animal models do not reflect sufficiently the situation in human, human studies are essential to correctly evaluate the efficiency and safety of the drug. Apelin effect in human depends not only on way of administration and dosage, but also differs in healthy people and patients with heart failure. In recent human study the effect of apelin-36 and [Pyr1]-apelin-13 was explored in different protocols [123]. In volunteers, the effect of apelin-36 on coronary artery and myocardial contractility was evaluated. Intracoronary boluses of apelin-36 and saline were administered via a coronary guide catheter in two different doses (20 and 200nmol in 2ml). While there were no changes in heart rate and blood pressure in both doses, apelin-36 administration in higher dose (200nmol) increased coronary blood flow [123]. In the second protocol, intrabrachial administration of apelin caused vasodilatation both in volunteers and in patients with heart failure. Apelin systemic administration into large antecubital veins of healthy volunteers in high dose led to slightly increased heart rate, increased cardiac output, and reduced peripheral blood resistance. In contrast, in patients with heart failure increase in cardiac output and reduction in blood pressure and peripheral blood resistance could be seen. It was also found that apelin effect on blood pressure depends on age. In young healthy subjects was blood pressure maintained, whereas older subjects and patients with heart failure had slight reduction [123].

### 8.2 Apelin analogues can overcome apelin short half-life

The use of native apelin peptide for in vivo treatment is hampered by its short half-life, which is not longer than 5 min [124-126] and is particularly caused by rapid proteolysis by angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [124]. To overcome this drawback, apelin analogues with modified chemical structure are being designed. To date, several synthetic apelin analogues have been prepared. One of the first attempts was cyclic analogue derived from apelin-12 [127]. Apelin-12 analogues were also synthesized by Pisarenko et al. and administered by i.v. bolus injection at the onset of reperfusion after left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery occlusion at previously optimized dose of 0, 35 μmol/kg. Apelin analogue with replaced methionine by nor-leucine and included Nα-methylarginine moiety in N-terminus of the peptide proved to reduce infarct size [128]. Apelin analogue II, more resistant to proteolytic cleavage, was synthesized by Wang and his colleagues and applied ex vivo after the ischemic period to damaged heart of APLN⁻/⁻ and APLN⁺/⁺ mice. This resulted in recovery of myocardial performance and increased Akt and Erk1/2 phosphorylation [20]. The apelin analogue also stimulated endothelial sprouting with longer capillary tube formation and increased phospho-Akt in endothelial progenitor cells [20]. On the other hand, apelin deficiency in APLN⁻/⁻ mice was connected with reduced nuclear translocation of HIF-1α, inability to upregulate VEGF and decreased angiopoietin-2 level in infarcted myocardium [20]. Other approach is development of analogues that stabilize APJ receptor in certain conformation after binding. These apelin analogues bind to the same receptor, but activate different signalling pathways [129]. MM07 mimicking conformation of apelin-13, for example, was designed to preferentially stimulate the G-protein pathway over β-arrestin and to avoid β-arrestin-dependent cardiac hypertrophy [125]. This analogue was reported to increase cardiac output dose-dependently, but without effect on blood pressure or heart rate [125].

### 9. Conclusions

Despite significant progress in therapy, AMI remains the leading cause of mortality in the developed world. The re-vascularization potential of percutaneous coronary intervention, which is today an

established therapy for AMI, has been shown to be improved by subsequent stem cell transplantation. Nevertheless, the outcomes of clinical studies on stem cell transplantation vary and point to little long-term benefit [130]. New approaches are therefore being applied in experimental models, including cell-sheet transplantation [131, 132], gene modification of stem cells [11, 133], and co-delivery of stem cells with pro-angiogenic growth factors [13]. Recently, apelin, a critical enhancer of angiogenesis, was reported to be reduced in patients after MI [20] while lower apelin level had an inhibitory effect on vascular sprouting and myocardial angiogenesis [20]. Hence, a supportive therapy with apelin and its analogues might bring a beneficial effect to AMI patients. The effect of apelin in animal models has been investigated with promising results [18, 116]. Apelin also has been used for pre-treatment of murine bone marrow cells which later were delivered intramyocardially, thereby resulting in increased angiogenesis and attenuated cardiac fibrosis formation [134]. As can be seen in animal and human studies, three main parameters are to be considered in apelin treatment, apelin form, length of treatment and way of administration. All three principle apelin forms, apelin-13, [Pyr1]-apelin-13 and apelin-36, have comparable efficacy in cardiovascular tissue [29]. Though, there are slight differences between them. Apelin-36, for example, acts slower [135] and apelin-13 post-translational modification of the N-terminal glutamate to [Pyr1]-apelin-13 protects this isoform from exopeptidase degradation [136]. Investigation of apelin treatment in long-term time horizon will be also needed as initial benefits from short-time apelin administration may not reflect situation in heart weeks or months later. It is known that for example in VEGF treatment, stability of newly formed vessels is dependent on VEGF continued stimulation for up to 4 weeks, otherwise the vessels regress [137]. To assure long-time apelin effect, two solutions how to overcome its short half-life are being proposed, synthetic analogues and apelin encapsulated in nanoparticles. The main difference is that apelin in its analogue form will be accessible immediately after administration, whereas encapsulation in nanoparticles enables slow release for longer period, in case of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles weeks or even months [138]. Release from PLGA nanoparticles is much slower than from liposomal nanoparticles that were reported to have peak of apelin release between 15 and 20h [121]. Moreover, speed of PLGA nanoparticles degradation can be regulated by their size and polymer composition [138, 139]. As patients have decreased apelin production up to 24 weeks after AMI [140], combined administration of apelin analogues or apelin in liposomal nanoparticles providing quick source in first days after MI, with use of PLGA nanoparticles sustaining apelin release for longer period could be beneficial. Safety of long-term apelin administration, however, needs to be verified, too. Although the finding that administration of apelin does not induce left ventricular hypertrophy is encouraging [141], several cases of atrioventricular block have been reported in sheep [119] and pro-atherosclerotic effect of apelin in carotid ligation model urges for further safety studies [102]. Besides *in vivo* studies of apelin treatment, its signalling pathway will be no less important field in apelin research. Apelin affects many signalling molecules in endothelial cells, nevertheless several studies indicate that apelin can both inhibit and stimulate a single transcription factor. This may result not only from distinct signalling pathways downstream from apelin/APJ signalling which affect the factor but also from reactions with other molecules inside the endothelial cell. In conclusion, although apelin is indisputably an important enhancer of angiogenesis, the apelin pathway must be thoroughly investigated if it is to fulfil its pro-angiogenic potential in AMI therapy.

Figure 1. (colour in print, 2-column)

Model of signalling pathways affecting apelin expression in endothelial cells (ECs). Hypoxia, Ang-1 and BMP-2 upregulate apelin in ECs. BMP-2 induces the formation of the PPARγ/β-catenin complex which binds to PPARγ response element (PPRE) in the apelin gene (APLN). In contrast, BMP-9

represses apelin expression via SMAD proteins. Notch signalling co-operates with SMAD proteins, inducing expression of UNC5B and VEGFR1 and inhibiting apelin.

Alk = activin receptor-like kinase; Ang-1 = angiopoietin-1; BMP = bone morphogenetic protein; BMPR = bone morphogenetic protein receptor; HIF = hypoxia-inducible factor; HRE = hypoxia-responsive element; Notch-ICD = Notch receptor intracellular domain; PPARγ = peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors; PPRE = PPARγ response element; Tie-2 = tyrosine-protein kinase receptor; UNC5B = unc-5 homolog B; VEGFR1 = vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1.

Figure 2. (colour in print, 2-column)

Assumed cross-talk of signalling pathways downstream of apelin/APJ signalling in endothelial cells (ECs). AKT/mTOR and ERK signalling pathways mediate the phosphorylation of p70S6 kinase, which induces ECs proliferation. MCP-1, important for recruitment of monocytes into ischemic area, can be repressed by apelin via Akt signalling. Akt blocks SMAD-mediated induction of MCP-1. In contrast, apelin can stimulate MCP-1 expression via JNK and NF-κB. MEF-2, which affects EC proliferation and capillary tube formation, is expressed after apelin stimulation via AMPK and is repressed by HDACs. MEF-2 further activates KLF-2, a factor vital for EC proliferation, angiogenesis and tight junction of ECs. MEF-2 can be repressed by HDAC5. Interaction between HDACs and MEF-2/KLF-2 can be disrupted by HDACs phosphorylation. Apelin also stimulates Ang-1 expression, and Ang-1 can further enhance apelin production.

AMPK = Adenosine monophosphate-activated kinase; Ang-1 = angiopoietin-1; APJ = angiotensin II protein J; eNOS = endothelial NO-synthase; ERK = extracellular-signal-regulated kinase; Gα/β/γ = G-protein α/β/γ; HDAC-5 = histone deacetylases; JNK = c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase; KLF-2 = Krüppel-like factor 2; MCP-1 = monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; MEF-2 = myocyte enhancer factor 2. mTOR = mammalian target of rapamycin; PI3K = PI3 kinase; p70S6K = p70S6 kinase.

Figure 3. (colour in print, 2-column)

Apelin effect on monocytes/macrophages after myocardial infarction (MI). During the first four days after MI (necrotic phase), the monocyte/macrophage subset of CD14<sup>high</sup>CD16<sup>low/negative</sup> phenotype produces pro-inflammatory cytokines. Later, increasing apelin secretion by endothelial cells (ECs) inhibits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and CD14<sup>high</sup>CD16<sup>low/negative</sup> monocytes/macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines.

APJ = angiotensin II protein J; IL = interleukin; MCP-1 = monocyte chemoattractant protein-1; M-CSF = macrophage colony-stimulating factor 1; MIP-1α = macrophage Inflammatory Protein 1α; TNF-α = tumour necrosis factor alpha; VLA-4 = very late antigen-4; VCAM-1 = vascular cell adhesion molecule 1.
