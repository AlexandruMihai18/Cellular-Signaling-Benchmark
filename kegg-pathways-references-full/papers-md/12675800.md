## Summary

A family of nine *Salmonella typhimurium* type III secretion effectors with a conserved amino-terminus have been defined. Three family members (SifA, SifB and SseJ) have previously been demonstrated to localize to the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole and to *Salmonella*-induced filaments. In contrast, we demonstrate that two other family members, SspH2 and Ssel, co-localized with the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton. These proteins also interacted with the mammalian actin cross-linking protein filamin in the yeast two-hybrid assay through their highly conserved amino-terminal domains. This amino-terminus was sufficient to direct localization to the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton, suggesting that the interaction with filamin is important for this subcellular localization. In addition, SspH2 co-localized with vacuole-associated actin polymerizations (VAP) induced by intracellular bacteria through the *Salmonella* pathogenicity island (SPI)-2 type III secretion system (TTSS). SspH2 interacted with the actin-binding protein profilin in the yeast two-hybrid assay and by affinity chromatography. This interaction was highly specific to SspH2 and was mediated by its carboxy-terminus. Furthermore, SspH2 inhibited the rate of actin polymerization *in vitro*, suggesting that it functions to reduce or remodel VAP. Strains with mutations in *sspH2* and *ssel* retained the ability to form VAP. However, a third intracellular virulence factor, *spvB*, which ADP-ribosylates actin, strongly inhibited VAP formation in HeLa cells, suggesting a more subtle effect for SspH2 and Ssel on the actin cytoskeleton.

## Introduction

Salmonellae are Gram-negative bacterial pathogens that contaminate food and water and cause a variety of disease syndromes, including gastroenteritis and enteric or typhoid fever. Survival and replication within host phagocytic cells is essential to Salmonellae pathogenesis for animals (Ohl and Miller, 2001). Salmonellae persist intracellularly within a membrane-bound vacuole, the initial formation of which is novel, originating from macropinocytosis and the formation of a spacious phagosome (Francis *et al.*, 1993; Alpuche-Aranda *et al.*, 1994). Unlike other phagosomes in which bacteria are degraded, the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) persists and contains viable replicating bacteria even after fusion with the lysosomal compartment (Oh *et al.*, 1996). These observations coupled with studies of the cellular markers associated with the SCV in epithelial cells and macrophages (Garcia-del Portillo and Finlay, 1995; Oh *et al.*, 1996; Rathman *et al.*, 1997; Meresse *et al.*, 1999; Steele-Mortimer *et al.*, 1999; Hashim *et al.*, 2000) indicate that Salmonellae reside in a novel intracellular compartment.

Two major virulence factors for Salmonellae are the virulence-associated type III secretion systems (TTSS) encoded within *Salmonella* pathogenicity islands-1 and -2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2) (Ohl and Miller, 2001). These two TTSS translocate effector proteins into the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells during different stages of the infection cycle. The SPI-1 TTSS translocates across the plasma membrane when Salmonellae initially contact the eukaryotic cell. SPI-1 effectors stimulate polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton in epithelial cells, inducing membrane ruffling and bacterial uptake into spacious phagosomes (Ohl and Miller, 2001). The translocon protein SipC has the capacity to substitute for the Arp2/3 complex by directly nucleating actin, and can also bundle actin filaments (Hayward and Koronakis, 1999). SipA binds to actin and decreases its critical concentration required for polymerization, inhibits depolymerization and enhances SipC activity (Zhou *et al.*, 1999; McGhie *et al.*, 2001). Some SPI-1 effectors interact with the actin regulatory network: SopE and SopE2 activate Cdc42 and Rac-1 by acting as GDP–GTP exchange factors (Hardt *et al.*, 1998; Stender *et al.*, 2000; Friebel *et al.*, 2001).

In contrast to SPI-1, the SPI-2 TTSS functions to translocate effector proteins across the membrane of the SCV.

(Miao and Miller, 2000) and promotes intracellular survival and replication (Hensel *et al.*, 1995; 1998; Cirillo *et al.*, 1998). Although Salmonellae are capable of surviving lysosome fusion with the SCV (Oh *et al.*, 1996), a variety of studies has implicated the SPI-2 TTSS in altering SCV properties (Uchiya *et al.*, 1999; Vazquez-Torres *et al.*, 2000; Gallois *et al.*, 2001). SPI-2 TTSS activity has been linked to a decrease in lysosomal fusion with the SCV (Uchiya *et al.*, 1999), the formation of novel filamentous endosomal structures in immortalized epithelial cells called Salmonella-induced filaments (sif) (Guy *et al.*, 2000), inhibition of trafficking of the NADPH oxidase to the SCV (Vazquez-Torres *et al.*, 2000; Gallois *et al.*, 2001) and maintenance of the integrity of the SCV membrane (Beuzon *et al.*, 2000). SPI-2 TTSS-dependent remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton was also described recently, with foci of polymerized actin observed around replicating intracellular bacteria (Meresse *et al.*, 2001). Although the function of these structures is currently unclear, they have been shown to co-localize transiently with sif (Brumell *et al.*, 2002). These observations suggest an intriguing degree of bacterial control over the actin cytoskeleton, both upon entry and during intracellular replication.

SPI-2 TTSS effectors are encoded both within SPI-2 (Hensel *et al.*, 1998) and elsewhere in the *S.* typhimurium chromosome (Miao and Miller, 2000; Knodler *et al.*, 2002). Unlike SPI-1 effectors, the functions of SPI-2 effectors remain largely unknown. Previous work identified several SPI-2 TTSS effectors encoded outside SPI-2 that are members of a family of Salmonella-translocated effectors (STE) with similar amino-termini (Miao and Miller, 2000). The STE family of TTSS effectors is unique in having a conserved amino-terminus, as no other known effectors associated with more than 11 TTSS (including SPI-1 and SPI-2) have similar amino-terminal domains directing translocation (Hueck, 1998). Three STEs, SifA, SifB and SseJ, localize to the SCV and sif after translocation (Brumell *et al.*, 2002; Freeman *et al.*, 2003). This paper demonstrates that SspH2 and Ssel (also called SrfH; Worley *et al.*, 2000) are localized to areas of actin polymerization through the interaction of their conserved amino-terminal domains most likely with the actin-binding protein filamin. In addition, SspH2 also interacts with profilin and alters the rate of actin polymerization *in vitro*.

### Results

#### SspH2 interacts with filamin and profilin

TTSS effectors alter host cell physiology by interacting with eukaryotic proteins. In an attempt to define the molecular function of the SPI-2 TTSS effector SspH2, a mouse cDNA library was screened to identify eukaryotic proteins interacting with SspH2 in the yeast two-hybrid assay. Approximately \(1.4 \times 10^7\) transformants were screened, resulting in the identification of eight yeast clones carrying plasmids conferring positive two-hybrid interactions. Six of these carried a plasmid encoding amino acid residues 719–861 of mouse α-filamin (also called actin-binding protein-280), whereas the other two encoded the entire coding region of profilin-1. Profilin is a small molecule that enhances actin polymerization by interacting directly with monomeric G-actin and decreasing its critical concentration to polymerize (for a review, see Schlüter *et al.*, 1997). Many profilin-binding proteins contain poly proline tracts that bind profilin; however, SspH2 does not contain poly proline motifs. Filamin exists as a dimeric protein composed of 24 repeats of a semi-conserved 96-amino-acid motif. The dimer roughly forms a ‘Y’ shape with an actin filament-binding domain at the end of each arm and a dimerization site at the base (for a review, see van der Flier and Sonnenberg, 2001; Stossel *et al.*, 2001). This dimer cross-links F-actin in areas of active polymerization. The cDNA clones that interact with SspH2 correspond to a portion of the fifth and sixth repeats, approximately in the middle of the arms. This region is identical between mouse and human filamin for 140 out of 144 residues but is only ≈35% identical to the other repeat regions within the filamin protein.

Deletional mapping was performed to determine the minimal region of SspH2 required for full interaction with filamin and profilin in the yeast two-hybrid assay. This analysis (Fig. 1A) indicated that the filamin-binding domain is located within the amino-terminal 61 residues of SspH2, whereas the profilin-binding domain is located in the carboxy-terminal domain of SspH2. To define further the specificity of this interaction, other members of the STE protein family (SspH1, SlrP, Ssel, SifA and SifB) were analysed for interaction with filamin in the yeast two-hybrid assay. None of these interacted with profilin (Fig. 1A), including SspH1, the carboxy-terminal domain of which is 77% identical to that of SspH2. STE family members with 31–37% identity to SspH2 within the amino-terminal 61 residues (SspH1, SlrP, SifA and SifB) did not interact with filamin (Fig. 1A). In contrast, Ssel, which has an amino-terminal domain that is 97% identical to SspH2<sub>1–61</sub> but has a completely dissimilar carboxyl-terminal domain, strongly interacted with filamin in the two-hybrid assay (Fig. 1A). An independent two-hybrid screen with Ssel as the bait protein was performed to determine whether it interacted with other cytoskeletal proteins. Approximately \(5 \times 10^6\) transformants were screened, resulting in the identification of four clones, all of which encoded a filamin clone identical to the SspH2 interacting sequence (M. Ohl and S. Miller, unpublished data). These results indicate that the filamin and profilin interactions with SspH2 demonstrate considerable sequence specificity.

polymerization. To determine whether this was the case, HEP-2 cells were transiently transfected with a construct expressing SspH2-GFP, and subcellular localization of SspH2, actin filaments and filamin was examined by immunofluorescence and deconvoluting microscopy (Fig. 2). When these cells are plated at a low confluency on glass coverslips, membrane ruffles resulting from actin remodelling form as the cells spread on the coverslip surface. Filamin, as expected, was highly enriched in

Immunofluorescent visualization with deconvoluting microscopy was performed to detect GFP (A, B and D, green), F-actin (A–D, blue; and E, green), HA (C and D, red; and E, green) and filamin (A and B, red). F-actin was detected with rhodamine-labelled phalloidin (blue). Monoclonal antibodies HA.11 and MAB 1678 specific for the HA epitope tag and filamin, respectively, were detected with a Cy5- or FITC-conjugated secondary antibody.

Filamin and SspH2 co-localize in transfected cells

The two-hybrid results suggested that SspH2 and Ssel might interact with the actin cytoskeleton in areas where filamin and profilin are enriched, i.e. areas of active actin

membrane ruffles where actin was polymerizing, and was also found in the cytoplasm (Fig. 2A). SspH2 displayed a similar localization pattern, being highly enriched in membrane ruffles (Fig. 2A–D) and strongly co-localizing with filamin (Fig. 2A). In contrast, neither SspH2 nor filamin co-localized with actin stress fibers present at lower optical sections in these cells (data not shown). In addition, SspH2-GFP also showed perinuclear enrichment (Fig. 2A–D). Haemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged SspH2 (SspH2-HA) displayed an identical localization pattern by indirect immunofluorescence (data not shown). These results raised the hypothesis that subcellular localization of SspH2 is directed by its interaction with filamin and/or other cytoskeletal proteins.

In contrast to SspH2, other leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing STE that do not interact with filamin display different localization patterns. Although HA epitope-tagged SspH2 was enriched in the cortical cytoskeleton in transiently transfected RAW264.7 macrophages and CHO cells, SlrP-HA was not enriched in the cortical regions of these cells (A. Haraga and S. Miller, unpublished data). We subsequently demonstrated that SlrP-HA is also not enriched in membrane ruffles in transiently transfected HEP-2 cells, and localizes diffusely to the cytoplasm (Fig. 2E), indicating that the enrichment of SspH2, Ssel and filamin observed in ruffles is not non-specific.

**The amino-termini of SspH2 and Ssel direct subcellular localization**

Although both SspH2 and Ssel interact with filamin in the yeast two-hybrid assay, they contain completely different carboxy-terminal domains. However, if the two-hybrid interaction with filamin is predictive for subcellular localization, Ssel would also be predicted to be enriched in areas of membrane ruffling and should co-localize with SspH2. Transient transfection of HEP-2 cells revealed that HA epitope-tagged Ssel also co-localizes with polymerizing actin in membrane ruffles (Fig. 2C). Upon co-transfection, both SspH2-GFP and Ssel-HA were found to co-localize with actin in areas of membrane ruffling and with each other (Fig. 2D), although not associating with actin stress fibres (data not shown).

This result suggested that the amino-terminal domain acts as a subcellular localization domain and is sufficient to direct cytoskeletal localization. In order to test this hypothesis, the first 167 amino acid residues of SspH2 were fused to GFP and expressed in HeLa cells by transient transfection. By immunofluorescent detection, actin, filamin and SspH2<sub>1–167</sub>-GFP co-localized and were enriched in membrane ruffles (Fig. 2B), supporting the hypothesis that the amino-terminal domain directs subcellular localization.

SspH2, Ssel and several other SPI-2 effectors are not required for vacuole-associated actin polymerization

Our two-hybrid and subcellular localization results suggest that SspH2 and Ssel may participate in SPI-2 TTSS-induced vacuole-associated actin polymerization (VAP), which was described recently (Meresse *et al.*, 2001). We also observed this phenomenon in cells infected with SPI-2 expressing *S*. typhimurium. Cultured mammalian cells were infected with *S*. typhimurium for 6–10 h and stained for immunofluorescent detection of bacteria and polymerized actin. In order to establish reproducible infection conditions for VAP formation, a variety of cell lines was examined. Actin condensation was observed in the vicinity of the SCV in several epithelial cell lines, including SiHa (data not shown), Caski (Fig. 3A) and BHK (Fig. 3C), and in the macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 (Fig. 3B). The most striking VAP was observed near tightly clustered bacteria in BHK cells. VAP was rarely seen around isolated bacteria, suggesting that a mass of bacteria is required to induce this phenomenon. Most often, the bacterial group was found in a concave shape with VAP in the interior curvature. In BHK cells, this morphology was especially pronounced with many cells displaying a ‘C’- or ‘O’-shaped bacterial mass with a central region of VAP (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, actin condensation around bacteria in HeLa cells was very limited (Fig. 6A).

The contribution of several effectors to the formation of these actin structures was examined. A strain deleted for both *sspH2* and *ssel* was constructed and used to infect BHK cells in order to assess the contribution of these two STE to the induction of actin polymerization. Cells infected with a Δ*sspH2* Δ*ssel/* strain showed the characteristic VAP formation (Fig. 3E), indicating that these two STE are not essential for this phenomenon. Thus, other SPI-2 effectors could be responsible for the induction of VAP. Likely candidates within SPI-2 are encoded within the *sse* operon, including *sseE*, *sseF* and *sseG*. Several strains carrying polar transposon insertions in either *sseE* or *sseF* (Guy *et al.*, 2000) were examined for their ability to induce VAP in isolation or in the presence of deletions in both *sspH2* and *ssel*. Inoculating cultures were randomized, and BHK cells seeded on coverslips were infected for 6 h, after which the cells were fixed and stained for immunofluorescent detection of bacteria or F-actin. Forty cells infected with 3–15 bacteria were counted per coverslip for the presence or absence of polymerized actin near the SCV. The percentage of VAP-positive cells from four separately scored coverslips was averaged. Although an SPI-2 apparatus mutant (*ssaT*) was defective for VAP formation as demonstrated previously (Meresse *et al.*, 2001), strains carrying the mutations Δ*sspH2*, Δ*ssel*, *sseE::MudJ* and *sseF::MudJ* singly or in combination were competent for VAP formation after a 6 h infection in BHK cells (Table 1).

Cultured cells were infected with wild-type bacteria for 8 h (1 h plus 7 h gentamicin treatment) and stained for immunofluorescent detection of actin (red) with rhodamine–phalloidin and bacteria (green) with anti-LPS antisera and anti-rabbit conjugated to FITC or Alexa Fluor 350 secondary. Immunofluorescent visualization by deconvoluting microscopy was performed. VAP structures are indicated by white arrows when present.

C–E. BHK cells infected with (C) wild type, (D) SPI-2 mutant bacteria (*ssaT::mTn5*) or (E) *ΔsspH2Δssel*.

These experiments do not rule out the possibility that any of these effectors may participate in or modulate the VAP. However, they do indicate that at least five proven or putative SPI-2 effectors (*SseEFGI* and *SspH2*) are dispensable for VAP formation in BHK cells.

Filamin and SspH2 localize to VAP

Polymerization of actin to form VAP probably involves recruitment of multiple cellular factors that normally participate in actin polymerization. Because of the proposed interaction between SspH2/Ssel and filamin, filamin localization in infected cells was examined for co-localization with VAP. BHK cells were infected with *S.* *typhimurium* and stained for immunofluorescent detection of bacteria, actin and filamin. Filamin was present in the cytoplasmic frac-

tion and was enriched in the cortical actin cytoskeleton, as observed previously. In many infected cells, filamin was not enriched near VAP. However, in some cells, filamin enrichment co-localized with VAP (Fig. 4A). Such cells were found more commonly 6 h after infection and were not observed at appreciable frequencies at later time points (8 h or later). These results are consistent with the cellular recruitment of filamin to polymerizing actin. Once actin ceases to polymerize and forms static structures, such as stress fibres, filamin no longer binds F-actin. Similarly, early during VAP formation, filamin may be recruited to cross-link actin. At later time points, actin polymerization within VAP may slow or cease, resulting in the release of filamin.

Because SspH2 interacts with cytoskeletal proteins and is translocated by the SPI-2 TTSS, we hypothesized that SspH2 may localize to VAP. To test this hypothesis, BHK

cells were transfected with SspH2-GFP and subsequently infected with *S.* *typhimurium* for 4–10 h before fixation and immunofluorescent detection of bacteria, F-actin and SspH2. Bacterial masses were again found to be associated with polymerized actin; however, the morphology of these actin condensations appeared to be slightly different from that seen in untransfected cells. Rather than forming large foci of polymerized actin, polymerized actin was often isolated to specific separated spots near intracellular bacteria. Interestingly, SspH2-GFP was highly enriched immediately adjacent to each of these foci of actin polymerization. Four and 10 h after infection, bacteria were observed to be immediately adjacent to actin condensations, each of which was adjacent to an area of SspH2-GFP enrichment (Fig. 4A–C). These results are consistent with the hypothesis that SspH2 is localized to VAP, and suggest that SspH2 alters VAP.

SspH2 inhibits actin polymerization in vitro

Profilin is an integral player in the polymerization of the actin cytoskeleton (Theriot and Mitchison, 1993; Sohn and Goldschmidt-Clermont, 1994; Yang et al., 2000). Because SspH2 interacts with profilin and co-localizes with polymerizing actin, the ability of SspH2 to affect actin polymerization *in vitro* was examined by the pyrene actin polymerization assay. In this assay, actin polymerization can be monitored by an increase in pyrene fluorescence (Skoble et al., 2000). When purified GST-SspH2 protein was added to polymerizing actin, no alteration in the rate of polymerization was observed (data not shown).

The addition of cellular factors, such as the actin nucleating complex Arp2/3 and profilin, to polymerizing actin will enhance the rate of polymerization (Welch et al., 1998; Yang et al., 2000). Mouse brain extract (0.5 mg ml⁻¹) was used to supply cellular factors to pyrene actin assays. Addition of GST-SspH2 to polymerizing actin in the presence of mouse brain extract resulted in a reproducible inhibition in the rate of polymerization (Fig. 5). This effect was saturated at 500 nM GST-SspH2. Lower concentrations of GST-SspH2 (25, 50 and 100 nM) showed very slight inhibition, whereas 250 nM GST-SspH2 had an intermediate phenotype, indicating that this inhibition is dose dependent. In order to verify that the GST fusion did not alter the activity of SspH2, two other protein preparations were examined: SspH2-GST and purified SspH2 with the affinity purification tag removed using the

IMPACT-CN expression system (New England Biolabs). Identical inhibition was observed when GST-SspH2 was compared with SspH2-GST or purified SspH2 (data not shown). As SspH1 is 69% identical to SspH2, but does not interact with filamin or profilin in the two-hybrid assay, it was used to examine the specificity of this activity. Addition of GST-SspH1 had no effect on the rate of extract-enhanced actin polymerization (Fig. 5). Although Ssel interacts with filamin, purified His₆-Ssel also had no effect on extract-enhanced actin polymerization (data not shown). These results indicate that this effect is highly specific to SspH2.

In order to determine whether the maximum rate of polymerization was altered, the rate of polymerization (% polymerized s⁻¹) was determined by finding the slope of a regression line fitted to a seven-point (70 s) consecutive sequence of data. (Using a five-point sequence of data yielded slightly higher rates of polymerization, and standard deviations for these rates were more than double those for the seven-point sequence. However, the hypothesis test shown below gave the same result.) The data for each of the trials (number of trials, \( m = 3-5 \)) were pooled for the same sequence of time values. The number of data points (\( n \)) used for each test was thus \( n = 7*m \). The mean and standard deviation of the maximum polymerization rates found for each curve are shown in Table 2. To determine whether these slopes are significantly different, a hypothesis test using a Student’s *t*-test statistic was performed. The MB and SspH1 polymerization rates were not

Pyrene-labelled actin (2 μM) was mixed with 0.5 mg ml⁻¹ mouse brain extract, GST fusion proteins and initiation buffer in a final volume of 60 μl. The reaction was pipetted into a submicron quartz cuvette, and fluorescence was measured using a Fluorolog-2 fluorometer at 10 s intervals. The excitation and emission wavelengths were 365 nm and 407 nm respectively. Averages of at least four runs are shown.

a. Pyrene actin polymerization experiments containing mouse brain extract or with the addition of 0.5 μM GST-SspH1 or 0.5 μM GST-SspH2. The number of polymerization reactions included was 'm', whereas the number of data points was seven per reaction.

b. The rate shown (% polymerization s⁻¹) was the maximum rate observed over any 70 s interval for data shown in Fig. 5.

c. Standard deviation of three to five reactions is indicated. Reactions in the presence of SspH2 were statistically different from extract alone (t = 13.1, P < 0.001) and SspH1 (t = 16.2, P < 0.001), whereas extract alone and SspH1 were not different (t = –0.6, P = 0.5).

HeLa cells seeded on glass coverslips were infected with wild-type S. typhimurium or the mutant strains ΔsspH2, spvB::aph or ΔsspH2 spvB::aph for 12 h. Cells were fixed and stained to detect polymerized actin and bacteria by indirect immunofluorescence. Infecting cultures were randomized, and 60 infected cells per coverslip were scored in a blinded fashion for the presence of VAP or actin spots. Cells containing 6–60 bacteria were counted (most counted cells contained 15–40 bacteria per cell) on three or four coverslips per strain. Interestingly, cells infected with the spvB mutant strain displayed a significant decrease in the incidence of actin spots and an increase in VAP formation. VAP induced by spvB mutants was either organized condensed actin structures similar significantly different (P = 0.5). Averaging their polymerization rates and pooling the standard deviation yields a rate of 0.0065 ± 0.0002. On the other hand, the rate for SspH2 (0.0053 ± 0.0002) was significantly different from that for both MB and SspH1 (P < 0.001). This difference represents a 17.5% decrease in the maximum rate of polymerization in the presence of SspH2. This difference probably accounts for the majority of the alteration in actin kinetics observed in the presence of SspH2. However, because the lag phase in our curves is relatively brief, we cannot rule out the possibility that an additional inhibition of actin filament nucleation also occurs. Thus, our data indicate that the maximal rate of cellular extract-enhanced actin polymerization is decreased in the presence of SspH2, but not in the presence of SspH1.

SpvB, but not SspH2, is sufficient to inhibit VAP formation in HeLa cells

Interestingly, Salmonella encodes a virulence factor, SpvB, which may inhibit VAP formation. SpvB is expressed by intracellular bacteria (Fierer et al., 1993) and ADP-ribosylates monomeric actin, making it incompetent for polymerization (Lesnick et al., 2001; Tezcan-Merdol et al., 2001). Salmonella expressing SpvB have been shown to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton of infected cells at late time points after infection (Tezcan-Merdol et al., 2001) dependent on the SPI-2 TTSS (Browne et al., 2002). Because SspH2 inhibits actin polymerization in vitro, we hypothesized that it may act in concert with SpvB to limit VAP formation. Interestingly, although VAP was observed in several cell types (Fig. 3; Meresse et al., 2001), HeLa cells formed strikingly reduced VAP at 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 h after infection (Fig. 6; data not shown). Rather, small foci of polymerized actin ‘spots’ that were separated and not organized into morphological VAP were observed in infected cells in the midst of the bacterial mass (Fig. 6). Thus, we hypothesized that Salmonella-encoded factors may inhibit VAP formation in HeLa cells.

Salmonella intracellular effectors 409

The VAP filaments observed in HeLa cells infected with *spvB* mutants were morphologically similar to sif. In order to determine whether polymerized actin co-localized with sif, HeLa cells were infected for 16 h with wild-type or *spvB* mutant strains expressing an epitope-tagged SPI-2 TTSS effector that localizes to sif (SseJ-HA). Significant co-localization of actin and SseJ-HA was detected in cells infected with *spvB* mutants, with extensive sif and VAP networks (Fig. 7A). Wild-type bacteria also produced extensive sif networks that did not co-localize with polymerized actin (Fig. 7B) Actin structures extending away from the bacterial mass and co-localizing with SseJ-HA could also be detected in BHK cells infected with wild-type *Salmonella*, but to a lesser extent (data not shown).

### Discussion

The SPI-2 TTSS is rare among TTSS in that it is expressed by intracellular bacteria and translocates effectors across the vacuolar membrane to promote intracellular

a. HeLa cells were seeded to coverslips and infected with various *S.* typhimurium strains for 12 h (1 h infection plus 11 h gentamicin treatment). A total of 60 infected cells per coverslip were scored for actin spot (Fig. 6A) or VAP (Fig. 6B) morphologies. Average and standard deviation of three or four coverslips are shown.

to those observed in BHK cells (data not shown) or elongated actin filaments that radiated away from or around the bacterial mass (Fig. 6B). In contrast, addition of ΔsspH2 (Table 3) and ΔsseI (data not shown) mutations to wild type or *spvB* mutants did not significantly alter the actin morphology present in HeLa cells. This indicates that SpvB, but not SspH2 or SseI, is required to inhibit VAP formation in HeLa cells.

lar replication (Cirillo *et al.*, 1998; Hensel *et al.*, 1998). There is evidence that *Salmonella* encode as many as 10–20 effectors that are translocated across the membrane of the SCV (Miao *et al.*, 1999; Miao and Miller, 2000; Worley *et al.*, 2000; Uzzau *et al.*, 2001; Brumell *et al.*, 2002; Hansen-Wester *et al.*, 2002a; Knodler *et al.*, 2002). In this work, two of these proteins, SspH2 and SseL, were demonstrated to localize with the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton, most likely through an interaction with the actin cross-linking protein filamin. SspH2 was also found to bind profilin in the yeast two-hybrid assay and by affinity chromatography. In addition, purified SspH2 altered the rate of pyrene actin polymerization *in vitro*.

SspH2 and SseL are members of the STE effector family, all of which share amino acid similarities within their amino-terminal domains. Although SspH2 and SseL localize to the polymerizing actin cytoskeleton through their amino-termini, other STE (SifA, SifB and SseJ) localize to sif and do not interact with the actin cytoskeleton (J. Freeman, M. Ohl and S. Miller, unpublished data (Brumell *et al.*, 2002; Ruiz-Albert *et al.*, 2002). Thus, the amino-terminus of STE is not a conserved actin localization signal and the residues of SspH2/SseL that are variable between SspH2/SseL and other STE proteins must confer the filamin interaction and localization pattern. Although the amino acid identity between most STE amino-terminal domains is <37%, SspH2 and SseL share nearly identical amino-termini. Because *sseL* appears to have evolved

more recently, this led to the hypothesis that *sseL* was generated by recombination of the portion of *sspH2* encoding the amino-terminal domain, with novel DNA encoding the carboxy-terminal domain (Miao and Miller, 2000). Thus, this indicates that *sseL* acquired not only an SPI-2 TTSS translocation signal, but also a functional subcellular localization domain by recombination.

The yeast two-hybrid interaction between this domain and mammalian filamin suggests a mechanism for the amino-terminal directed subcellular localization of SspH2 and SseL, although we were unable to confirm a direct interaction between filamin and SspH2 by affinity chromatography. These proteins localize to the portion of the actin cytoskeleton that is recently polymerized, and is enriched for filamin. Upon interacting with filamin, SspH2/SseL could alter the ability of filamin to cross-link actin filaments or to serve as a scaffolding protein. Because SspH2 and SseL bind filamin in a region (repeats 5 and 6) that is distant from the actin filament-binding domain (Fig. 8), and because cells transfected with SspH2 and/or SseL form ruffles (Fig. 2), it seems unlikely that SspH2 or SseL alters the actin cross-linking activity of filamin. Although many host proteins scaffold on filamin, the location of known binding sites is also distant from the SspH2/SseL binding site, as all known interactions occur between repeats 17 and 24 (Stossel *et al.*, 2001). Therefore, it seems unlikely that SspH2/SseL binding to filamin displaces specific proteins localized to actin cross-links by

**Fig. 8. Salmonella proteins interacting with the actin cytoskeleton.** Polymerized actin (F-actin, purple) is cross-linked by filamin (orange), and polymerization is enhanced by profilin-bound monomeric actin (profilactin, purple/blue). SspH2 has three major domains: an amino-terminal domain (green), 12 leucine-rich repeats (LRR12, light yellow) and a carboxy-terminal domain (dark red). SseL can be separated into amino- and carboxy-terminal domains (green and pink). SspH2 and SseL have nearly identical amino-terminal domains, which bind to repeats 5 and 6 in filamin (shown in red). SspH2 also interacts with profilin (blue). It is likely that additional eukaryotic binding partners (noted by ‘?’) also interact with the SspH2 LRR domain and the SseL carboxy-terminus. SpvB (yellow) ADP-ribosylates monomeric actin (purple with red/yellow mark), which is subsequently incompetent for polymerization.

scaffolding on filamin. Similar to its function as a scaffolding protein for cellular factors, filamin may localize SspH2 and Ssel to polymerizing actin.

Although the amino-terminus determines subcellular localization, other domains of these effectors are more likely to have effector function. In this regard, the interaction with the cytoskeletal protein profilin provides evidence that SspH2 remodels the actin cytoskeleton. Another binding partner may interact with this domain, as experiments using purified profilin did not demonstrate direct binding to SspH2. A protein containing polyproline profilin-binding motifs may bridge an indirect interaction between profilin and the SspH2 carboxy-terminus.

Profilin and proteins that bind profilin are involved in actin polymerization, suggesting that SspH2 may have an effect on the polymerizing cytoskeleton. We demonstrated that SspH2 produced a dose-dependent inhibition of the rate of pyrene actin polymerization. This observation supports our hypothesis that SspH2 interacts with components of the actin cytoskeleton. The dependence of this effect on a cellular extract suggests that SspH2 does not affect actin directly but interacts with other proteins that participate in the polymerization process, such as profilin. These experiments are not, however, conclusive for a polymerization-inhibiting action for SspH2 *in vivo*. The observed inhibition could result from binding of actin polymerization-enhancing factors, resulting in effective sequestration of these factors in the *in vitro* assay. When other *Salmonella* effectors are present and actin is assembled around the SCV, it is possible that SspH2 has an activity different from that observed in the pyrene actin polymerization assays. It is also possible that the entire complement of SspH2 eukaryotic binding partners is not present in the extracts used in these experiments. Although profilin and filamin are both present in the soluble fraction (data not shown), unknown factors may interact with the LRR and carboxy-terminal domains of SspH2. In addition, it is also plausible that some SspH2 effects on the cytoskeleton require prior action of other SPI-2 effectors and that its function is co-ordinated with other effectors. In any case, the effect of SspH2 alone on polymerizing actin could be a subtle alteration in the rate of polymerization, which may not alter the end-point of polymerization. Indeed, transiently transfected cells expressing SspH2 still form membrane ruffles.

Despite the observed effect of SspH2 on actin polymerization *in vitro*, no alteration in VAP morphology was observed for ΔsspH2 *Salmonella* mutants. This lack of a phenotype may be explained by functional redundancy among effectors, exemplified by the fact that several SPI-1 effectors co-operate to promote invasion of epithelial cells through stimulation of macropinocytosis. Strains carrying single mutations in *sopE*, *sopE2* and *sopB* all invade cultured epithelial cells, whereas a triple *sopE sopE2*

*sopB* mutant is highly defective for invasion (Mirolf *et al.*, 2001; Zhou *et al.*, 2001). The SPI-1 TTSS effectors SipA, SopA, SopB, SopD and SopE2 also work in concert *in vivo* to produce diarrhoea in calves (Zhang *et al.*, 2002). Phenotypic redundancy may be a common theme among SPI-1 and SPI-2 TTSS effectors. Evidence that SPI-2 effectors may be functionally redundant or exert small effects can be observed by the phylogenetic distribution of effectors among different *Salmonella* serotypes. *sspH2* is found in roughly 67% of *Salmonella* isolates, including *S.* typhi and *S.* typhimurium, whereas *ssel* is present in only 25% of isolates (Miao *et al.*, 1999; Tsolis *et al.*, 1999; Hansen-Wester *et al.*, 2002b). Interestingly, *spvB* and *sseJ* are virulence factors for *S.* typhimurium, but are absent from *S.* typhi (Matsui *et al.*, 2001; Parkhill *et al.*, 2001; Ruiz-Albert *et al.*, 2002). Because *S.* typhi is highly virulent for humans, not all *Salmonella* virulence factors are required for *Salmonella* pathogenesis in all settings. Thus, considering the likelihood of phenotypic redundancy, intracellular *Salmonella* may translocate numerous modulators of the actin cytoskeleton and VAP, in addition to SspH2, Ssel and SpvB (Fig. 8).

Several lines of evidence now suggest that *Salmonella* actively limits SPI-2-induced actin polymerization. This idea is supported by data indicating that SspH2 and SpvB, two intracellular *Salmonella* effectors, inhibit actin polymerization (Fig. 5; Lesnick *et al.*, 2001; Tezcan-Merdol *et al.*, 2001; Browne *et al.*, 2002). SpvB ADP-ribosylates actin, preventing polymerization, and inhibits VAP formation in HeLa cells. In addition, VAP has a highly variable morphology between different cultured mammalian cell lines. In BHK cells, VAP was most commonly observed in the interior of bacterial masses (Fig. 3), whereas in Swiss 3T3 cells, VAP circumscribes the SCV (Meresse *et al.*, 2001). Inhibition of VAP is observed in HeLa cells, which form very little VAP when infected with wild-type *S.* typhimurium. Despite this VAP inhibition, HeLa cells are quite permissive for *Salmonella* replication and sif formation, suggesting that persistent VAP may not be required for intracellular replication.

Nevertheless, evidence suggests that stimulation of actin polymerization is important for intracellular *Salmonella*. Meresse *et al.* (2001) demonstrated that, in cells infected with *Salmonella*, inhibition of actin polymerization with latrunculin B resulted in a SPI-2 TTSS-dependent release of the bacteria into the cytoplasm. Thus, actin polymerization may be required for maintenance of the integrity of the SCV membrane. There is also evidence that actin polymerizes on sif, as actin filaments co-localize with sif as well as the SCV (Fig. 7; Meresse *et al.*, 2001; Brumell *et al.*, 2002). In addition, inhibition of sif formation by mutation of *sifA* results in the release of *Salmonella* from the vacuolar compartment into the cytoplasm (Beuzon *et al.*, 2000), similar to the phenotype observed

when actin polymerization is inhibited. However, sif formation is dependent upon the microtubular network and is inhibited by nocodazole, but not by cytochalasin (Brumell *et al.*, 2002), and *Salmonella* *sifA* mutants that do not form sif still form VAP (Meresse *et al.*, 2001). Therefore, the formation of sif and VAP is not strictly dependent upon each other, and a more complex interaction between the vacuolar compartment and the actin cytoskeleton of *Salmonella*-infected cells is likely.

Thus, current evidence suggests that *Salmonellae* promote actin polymerization near the SCV and along sif filaments. Polymerization may be induced by TTSS translocon insertion into the eukaryotic membrane. This hypothesis is drawn from analogy with the SPI-1 and Ysc TTSS. The SPI-1 TTSS translocon protein SipC nucleates actin polymerization (Hayward and Koronakis, 1999). The *Yersinia* Ysc TTSS is closely related to SPI-2 and stimulates actin polymerization, probably through translocon components, which is subsequently inhibited by YopE (Viboud and Bliska, 2001). SPI-2 translocon-induced polymerization may be modified and later terminated by a variety of effector proteins. SspH2 and Ssel localize to actin cross-links through filamin and may remodel polymerizing actin, whereas SpvB probably terminates actin polymerization and disassembles VAP. In summary, this work, as well as that Lesnick *et al.* (2001) and Tezcan-Merdol *et al.* (2001), indicates that an important function of intracellular effectors is the inhibition of actin polymerization, and suggests that this inhibition is important for the intracellular lifestyle of *S.* *typhimurium*.

### Experimental procedures

#### Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Bacterial strains were constructed by P22HT *int* transduction as described previously (Davis *et al.*, 1980) in *S.* *enterica* serovar Typhimurium wild-type strain CS401, a derivative of ATCC 14028s. Δ*sspH2* (EM194) (Miao *et al.*, 1999), Δ*sseL* (JAF20) and Δ*sspH2ΔsseL* (EM513) were created by allelic exchange using pKAS32 (Skorupski and Taylor, 1996). *sseE::MudJ*, *sseF::MudJ* (Guy *et al.*, 2000) and *spvB::aph* (Gulig *et al.*, 1992) were transduced into CS401.

Bacteria were grown overnight in LB, diluted 1:50 and grown at 37°C for 3 h with aeration for infection of eukaryotic cells.

#### Yeast two-hybrid assay

Yeast two-hybrid interactions were determined in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* strain PJ69-4, which carries *gal4* promoter-driven genes encoding β-galactosidase, and biosynthesis genes for adenine and histidine (James *et al.*, 1996). Gal4 binding domain (BD) fusions to STE genes were cloned into the plasmid pGBD-U (James *et al.*, 1996). PJ69-4 expressing Gal4BD-SspH2 in pGBD-U were transformed with a murine cDNA library generated from day 9.5 and 10.5 embryos and size selected for an average insert of 500 bp fused to the VP16 activation domain (AD) (Hollenberg *et al.*, 1995). Approximately \(1.44 \times 10^7\) transformants were plated on –ura-leu-his + 5 mM 3AT. Positive clones were tested for growth on –ura-leu-ade media and for β-galactosidase production by filter assay (James *et al.*, 1996). Interacting clones were cured of the SspH2 bait plasmid by streaking on 5-FOA, and the specificity of the interaction was verified by rescuing the cDNA plasmid, retransforming PJ69-4 and mating with strains transformed with various bait plasmids. Streaking on –ura-leu-ade and β-galactosidase filter assay were performed to verify positive interactions (James *et al.*, 1996).

#### Eukaryotic cell growth conditions and transfections

BHK (a cell line derived from hamster kidney), Caski (a human cervical carcinoma cell line), HeLa (a human cervical carcinoma cell line) and HEP-2 (a subclone of the HeLa cell line) cells were grown in DMEM + 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 37°C with 5% CO₂, and RAW264.7 (a murine macrophage-like cell line) cells were grown in RPMI-1640 + 10% FBS at 37°C with 5% CO₂. HEP-2 and BHK cells were transfected using calcium phosphate precipitation; calcium phosphate precipitates with DNA were added to cells for 6 h, medium was changed, and cells were incubated for 12–36 h. BHK cells were also transfected with the Effectene transfection kit as indicated by the manufacturer (Qiagen). HeLa cells were also transfected with the Polyfect reagent as indicated by the manufacturer (Qiagen). SspH2-GFP (pEM139) and Ssel-HA (pEM135) were expressed from a TIGZ plasmid that had the IRES-GFP element removed and were co-transfected with pTAK/NEO expressing the tet promoter transactivator. Alternatively, SspH2-GFP was expressed from pEGFP that had the GFP cassette removed and replaced with SspH2-GFP (pEM151).

#### Immunofluorescent detection and microscopy

Cultured cells were seeded onto 11 mm coverslips before infection and/or transfection. After infection/transfection, cells were washed three times with PBS and fixed with 10% formalin for 15 min before washing and permeabilizing with either ice-cold acetone or 0.25% Triton X-100 in PBS. After washing and blocking for 1 h with PBS + 10% serum, samples were probed with various primary and secondary antibodies, mounted and examined using a Zeiss Axiovert S100 TV microscope with a 100× or 63× lens. Images were acquired and deconvolved using the SOFTWORX program (Applied Precision). HA epitope tag was detected with the monoclonal antibody HA.11 (Covance). Filamin was detected with the monoclonal antibody MAB1678 or MAB1680 (Chemicon) or rabbit polyclonal antisera raised against a fragment of mouse filamin (a kind gift from Bo Van Deurs). Filamentous actin was detected with rhodamine phalloidin. *Salmonella* was detected with rabbit polyclonal anti-LPS antibodies (Difco). Alternatively, *S.* *typhimurium* expressing GFP were used in infections; GFP was cloned into the Scal site of pBR322 and expressed from the ampicillin promoter (pEM180). Epitope-tagged SseJ-HA was expressed in S.

typhimurium from plasmid pJAF111 from its native promoter. Secondary detection was performed with various anti-rabbit or anti-mouse antibodies conjugated to Cy5, Alexa Fluor 350, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or tetramethyl rhodamine isothiocyanate (TRITC; Sigma, Chemicon). Filamentous actin was detected with phalloidin labelled with rhodamine or Alexa Fluor 568. All reagents were used at 1:1000 dilution except labelled phalloidin (1:250) and anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 350 (1:50).

Quantification of VAP was performed in blinded experiments. Bacteria were diluted in cell culture media to generate three or four inocula per strain, and these inocula were randomized. BHK or HeLa cells were seeded on coverslips in a 24-well plate at a density of \(4 \times 10^4\) cells per well and infected at an estimated multiplicity of infection (MOI) of five bacteria per cell. Cells were infected for 1 h, washed three times with PBS, media containing \(15 \mu\mathrm{g} \mathrm{ml}^{-1}\) gentamicin was added, and bacteria were allowed to grow intracellularly for 5 or 11 more hours. Cells were fixed and stained as above for bacteria and F-actin. Forty or 60 infected cells per coverslip were scored for actin morphology. After all coverslips were scored, the identity of the infecting strain was revealed, and the percentage positive for actin morphologies was averaged between the three or four coverslips for each strain.

### Protein purification and affinity chromatography

GST-SspH2 and GST-SspH1 were purified from *Escherichia coli* expressing either fusion protein. Cultures were grown to \(\mathrm{OD}_{600} \approx 0.4\) at \(37^\circ \mathrm{C}\), shifted to room temperature, \(1 \mathrm{mM}\) IPTG was added, and cultures were grown for 3 h before purification of GST proteins as described previously (Miao et al., 1999). Purified of intein-SspH2 expressed from pEM153 (SspH2 cloned into pTYB11) and cleavage of the intein tag with the IMPACT-CN protein purification system was performed at \(16^\circ \mathrm{C}\) as directed by the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). Proteins were dialysed three times against control buffer (see below), and aliquots were drop frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at \(-80^\circ \mathrm{C}\).

For GST pull-down experiments, a 15 cm dish of 293 cells was lysed in 5 ml of lysis buffer [1% Triton X-100, \(25 \mathrm{mM}\) Hepes, pH 7.5, \(150 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaCl}, 5 \mathrm{mM}\) EDTA, \(1 \mathrm{mM}\) dithiothreitol (DTT), plus protease inhibitors], frozen, thawed, sonicated briefly and centrifuged at \(18,000 \mathrm{r.p.m.}\) for 30 min to pellet cell debris. GST-SspH1 or GST-SspH2 (40 \(\mu \mathrm{g})\) was incubated with half the lysate and \(200 \mu \mathrm{l}\) of glutathione-agarose (50% slurry) overnight at \(4^\circ \mathrm{C}\). Columns were washed five times with \(5 \mathrm{ml}\) of lysis buffer and eluted with \(50 \mathrm{mM}\) glutathione. The entire elution was run on a quadrapartite SDS-PAGE gel (15%, 12%, 10% and 8% gels poured sequentially on top of each other, creating a pseudogradient gel), Western blotted and probed for profilin or filamin.

### Pyrene actin polymerization assays

Pyrene-labelled actin was purchased from Cytoskeleton. Fluorescence was measured with a Fluorolog-2 fluorometer at \(365 \mathrm{~nm}\) excitation, \(407 \mathrm{~nm}\) emission. Excitation slits were set at \(0.6 \mathrm{~mm}\) and emission slits at \(4.0 \mathrm{~mm}\). The cuvette chamber was kept at \(25^\circ \mathrm{C}\) with a circulating water bath. Fluorescence was measured at \(10 \mathrm{~s}\) intervals and integrated over \(1.5 \mathrm{~s}\). Pyrene-labelled actin was reconstituted according to the manufacturer’s instructions and frozen in \(5-15 \mu \mathrm{l}\) aliquots. An appropriate aliquot(s) were defrosted, and \(100 \mu \mathrm{l}\) of G buffer (5 mM Tris, pH 7.4, \(0.2 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{CaCl}_2\), \(0.2 \mathrm{mM}\) ATP, \(0.2 \mathrm{mM}\) DTT) was added per \(5 \mu \mathrm{l}\) of concentrated actin. This solution was passed through a 27.5 gauge syringe several times to shear actin polymers and incubated on ice overnight to permit depolymerization. The next day, the actin was centrifuged at \(100,000 \mathrm{r.p.m.}\) in a TLA100.1 rotor in a tabletop microcentrifuge for \(15 \mathrm{~min}\) to pellet the remaining polymerized actin. Supernatant was collected and protein content was determined by measuring the absorbance of a 1:10 dilution. Maxima near \(275-280 \mathrm{~nm}\) were divided by the extinction coefficient of actin (49,000) to determine the concentration. An actin mix stock at \(2.5 \mu \mathrm{M}\) was then mixed in G buffer. A sample of \(50 \mu \mathrm{l}\) of this stock was placed in one tube, and a second tube containing separated \(6 \mu \mathrm{l}\) drops of initiation buffer (20 mM MgCl₂, \(10 \mathrm{mM}\) EGTA, \(5 \mathrm{mM}\) ATP) and control buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH 7, \(100 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{KCl}, 5 \mathrm{mM}\) EGTA, \(1 \mathrm{mM}\) EDTA, \(10 \%\) glycerol, \(0.2 \mathrm{mM}\) ATP, \(0.5 \mathrm{mM}\) DTT) was placed at room temperature for 1 min exactly. Any protein or tissue extract additives added to the assay were stored in control buffer and included in the \(6 \mu \mathrm{l}\) control buffer drop. After 1 min, \(48 \mu \mathrm{l}\) of actin mix was pipetted into the second tube and pipetted up and down exactly three times to mix the actin, control buffer and initiation buffers. This reaction mixture was placed in a submicron quartz cuvette and inserted into the fluorometer. The time interval between adding the actin mix and initiating readings was recorded in order to correct for varying delays between mixing the reaction mix and initiating fluorometer readings. Fluorescence was measured over \(600-1200 \mathrm{~s}\). Runs were normalized such that the maximum fluorescence observed in the plateau was set to be \(100 \%\) polymerized actin.
