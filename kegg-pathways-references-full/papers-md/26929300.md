Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

ABSTRACT

The Pseudomonas aeruginosa cAMP-Vfr system (CVS) is a global regulator of virulence gene expression. Regulatory targets include type IV pili, secreted proteases, and the type III secretion system (T3SS). The mechanism by which CVS regulates T3SS gene expression remains undefined. Single cell expression studies previously found that only a portion of the cells within a population express the T3SS under inducing conditions, a property known as bistability. We now report that bistability is altered in a *vfr* mutant wherein a substantially smaller fraction of the cells express the T3SS relative to the parental strain. Since bistability usually involves positive feedback loops, we tested the hypothesis that Vfr regulates the expression of *exsA*. ExsA is the central regulator of T3SS gene expression and autoregulates its own expression. Although *exsA* is encoded as the last gene of the *exsCEBA* polycistronic mRNA, we demonstrate that Vfr directly activates *exsA* transcription from a second promoter (*P*<sub>*exsA*</sub>) located immediately upstream of *exsA*. *P*<sub>*exsA*</sub> promoter activity is entirely Vfr dependent. Direct binding of Vfr to a *P*<sub>*exsA*</sub> promoter probe was demonstrated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays and DNase I footprinting revealed an area of protection that coincides with a putative Vfr consensus-binding site. Mutagenesis of that site disrupted Vfr binding and *P*<sub>*exsA*</sub> promoter activity. We conclude that Vfr contributes to T3SS gene expression through activation of the *P*<sub>*exsA*</sub> promoter, which is internal to the previously characterized *exsCEBA* operon.

SIGNIFICANCE

Vfr is a cAMP-dependent DNA-binding protein that functions as a global regulator of virulence gene expression in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*. Regulation by Vfr allows for the coordinate production of related virulence functions such type IV pili and type III secretion, required for adherence to and intoxication of host cells, respectively. Although the molecular mechanism of Vfr regulation has been defined for many target genes, a direct link between Vfr and T3SS gene expression had not been established. In the present study, we report that Vfr directly controls exsA transcription, the master regulator of T3SS gene expression, from a newly identified promoter located immediately upstream of exsA.

INTRODUCTION

*Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is an environmental bacterium typically found in soil and water. The organism is also an important opportunistic pathogen of humans, especially in those with neutropenia, severe burns, and cystic fibrosis (1, 2). Both the physical and host environments expose *P. aeruginosa* to unique stresses that challenge survival. Reprogramming gene expression is critical for adaptation. The host signals to which the bacteria respond are not entirely clear, but likely include contact with host cell surfaces or host-derived macromolecules, temperature, osmolarity, pH, iron limitation, and oxidative stress (3-5). Bacterial genes induced within mammalian hosts include those important for iron acquisition, carbon utilization, and virulence factors such as type IV pili, Xcp and Hxc type II secretion systems, secreted factors (e.g., exotoxin A, protease IV, and elastase), and a type III secretion system (T3SS) (3, 5-8). Many of these virulence factors are directly controlled by the cAMP-Vfr signaling (CVS) system (9, 10). The CVS pathway is a global regulatory system consisting of the CyaA and CyaB adenylate cyclases, the CpdA phosphodiesterase, and the Vfr (virulence factor regulator) transcription factor (10). Intracellular cAMP is generated by CyaA and CyaB in response to poorly defined environmental signals (9), and cAMP homeostasis is maintained by the CpdA

86 phosphodiesterase (11). Vfr is a DNA-binding protein of the Escherichia coli Crp family (12), and

87 responds directly to increased intracellular pools of cAMP to activate expression of the CVS

88 regulon (11, 13, 14). Vfr binds to a well-characterized consensus site (5'-

89 ANWWTGNGAWNYAGWTCACAT) within target promoters (13). Direct binding of Vfr to the

90 promoter regions of many virulence factors has been demonstrated or can be inferred by the

91 presence of a consensus-binding site (10). One noted exception, however, is the T3SS.

92 Although Vfr was previously shown to regulate the T3SS (9), a mechanism has not been

93 described, and none of the known promoter regions for T3SS genes contain a Vfr consensus-

94 binding site.

95 The P. aeruginosa T3SS is an important virulence determinant known to contribute to acute

96 virulence phenotypes such as phagocytic avoidance, cytotoxicity, and systemic spread of P.

97 aeruginosa from initial sites of colonization (15). The T3SS is multi-protein complex that forms a

98 needle-like injectisome structure. The injectisome functions by translocating effector proteins

99 produced within the bacterial cytoplasm into host cells where they have anti-host effects that

100 include modulation of signal transduction, actin dynamics, inflammation, and cell death

101 pathways (15). The primary regulator of T3SS gene expression is the DNA-binding protein ExsA

102 (16, 17). T3SS genes are organized into 10 transcriptional units, each of which is controlled by

103 an ExsA-dependent promoter (18). ExsA is encoded as the last gene of the exsCEBA operon

104 and autoregulates its own transcription through direct activation of the \(P_{\text {exsc }}\) promoter (19).

105 T3SS gene expression is intimately coupled to secretory activity by a partner-switching

106 mechanism (18, 20). The partner-switching mechanism controls the DNA-binding activity of

107 ExsA and requires three additional proteins (ExsD, ExsC, and ExsE). ExsD is an anti-activator

108 that directly interacts with ExsA to inhibit DNA-binding activity (21). ExsC functions as both an

109 anti-anti-activator by binding to ExsD and as a chaperone for ExsE, a secreted substrate of the

110 T3SS (22). Type III secretory activity serves as a sensor of environmental conditions and

111 regulates the partner-switching mechanism. In non-permissive environments (high calcium or

4

112 the absence of host cells) the secretion system is assembled but inactive (21, 23). These
113 conditions favors formation of the ExsA-ExsD and ExsC-ExsE complexes and T3SS gene
114 expression is low (21, 22, 24-27). Inducing signals, which include low environmental Ca²⁺ and
115 contact with host cells, convert the secretion system into an active conformation leading to
116 secretion of ExsE (25, 26, 28). The corresponding decrease in the intracellular concentration of
117 ExsE triggers partner-switching wherein ExsC preferentially binds to ExsD and allows free ExsA
118 to activate T3SS gene expression.
119 The P. aeruginosa T3SS is expressed in only a subset of cells resulting in a property known
120 as bistability (23, 28, 29). Observed at the single cell level, bistability occurs when there is non-
121 homogeneous gene expression within a cell population. The mechanism of bistability usually
122 involves regulatory feedback loops (30). Feedback loops that may contribute to bistable
123 expression of the T3SS include ExsA autoregulation of its own expression (19) and the partner-
124 switching mechanism that controls ExsA activity (18). In the present study, we report that the
125 bistable phenotype is altered in a vfr mutant wherein a smaller percentage of cells are induced
126 for T3SS gene expression compared to the parental strain. We identified a Vfr-dependent
127 promoter (P_exsA) located immediately upstream of exsA, that appears to be critical for T3SS
128 gene expression. The P_exsA promoter region contains a consensus Vfr binding site, and
129 footprinting and binding studies confirmed that Vfr interacts with the P_exsA promoter region.
130 Mutagenesis of the Vfr binding site on the chromosome significantly reduced T3SS gene
131 expression. Unexpectedly, disruption of the Vfr binding site on the chromosome resulted in a
132 larger defect in T3SS gene expression relative to the vfr mutant. We conclude that Vfr regulates
133 T3SS gene expression through its effects on P_exsA promoter activity but cannot exclude the
134 possibility that additional Vfr-controlled functions also contribute to T3SS gene expression.

138 METHODS AND MATERIALS

139 Bacterial strains, culture conditions, and sample preparation. The bacterial strains

140 used in this study are provided in Table S1. *Escherichia coli* DH5α was used for general cloning

141 and maintained on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plates with gentamicin (15 μg/ml), tetracycline (12

142 μg/ml), or ampicillin (100 μg/ml) as appropriate. *E. coli* strain Tuner (DE3) was maintained on

143 LB agar with ampicillin (100 μg/ml). *P. aeruginosa* PA 103 strains were maintained on Vogel-

144 Bonner minimal media (VBM) with gentamicin (100 μg/ml) as necessary.

145 Plasmid and strain construction. The allelic exchange vector, reporter fusions, plasmids,

146 and primers used in their construction are listed in Tables S1 and S2, respectively. To generate

147 the Vfr binding site mutant (BSM) in the *P*<sub>exsA</sub> promoter region, two overlapping PCR fragments

148 containing upstream and downstream sequences flanking *P*<sub>exsA</sub> and the desired Vfr binding site

149 mutations (primer pairs 129092160-129781385 and 129781384-129092161) were amplified and

150 joined with pEXG2Tc (digested with HindIII and SacI) in a Gibson Assembly reaction (New

151 England Biolabs). The resulting construct (pEXG2Tc *P*<sub>exsA</sub> VBM) was conjugated from *E. coli*

152 SM10 into wt PA 103 and plasmid integrants were selected on VBM agar with tetracycline (50

153 μg/ml). Merodiploids were resolved by plating on YT agar (0.5% yeast extract and 1% tryptone)

154 with 5% sucrose. Successful integration of *P*<sub>exsA</sub> Vfr binding site mutations was confirmed by

155 PCR amplification and sequencing. The *P*<sub>exsA</sub> and *P*<sub>exsAm</sub> reporter fusions were constructed as

156 follows: the region containing -193 to +18 (relative to the exsA transcriptional start site

157 previously mapped by RNAseq (4)) was PCR amplified from wt PA 103 or the PA103 *P*<sub>exsA</sub> VBM

158 mutant (primer pair 126323955-126639110) and joined with the mini-CTX-lacZ vector (precut

159 with EcoRI and BamHI) by incubation in a Gibson assembly reaction (New England Biolabs).

160 Reporter constructs were integrated at the attB site of PA 103 as previously described (31). The

161 *P*<sub>exsD-gfp</sub> reporter fusion was constructed by transferring the *P*<sub>exsD</sub> promoter region as an EcoRI-

162 HindIII restriction fragment from mini-CTX-*P*<sub>exsD-lacZ</sub> to the corresponding sites in pJNE 05. The

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

163 P<sub>lacP1-gfp</sub> reporter fusion was cloned as a lacP1gBlock into EcoRI-HindIII digested pJNE05by
164 Gibson assembly.
165 Transcriptional reporter assays. *P*. aeruginosa strains were grown overnight at 37°C on
166 VBM plates with appropriate antibiotics. The following day, cultures were diluted to an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.1
167 in trypticase soy broth with EGTA (2 mM) as indicated in figure legends. Cultures were
168 incubated at 37°C with shaking and samples were harvested when the culture A<sub>600</sub> reached 1.0.
169 β-galactosidase activity was assayed with the substrates ortho-nitrophenyl-β-galactopyranoside
170 (ONPG) as previously described (22) or chlorophenol red-β-D-galactopyranoside (CPRG).
171 CPRG activity was determined by measuring product formation at 578 nM and using an
172 adaptation of the Miller equation: CPRG units = (A<sub>578</sub>/culture A<sub>600</sub>/time [min]/culture vol [ml]) x
173 1000. CPRG and Miller units are reported as the average of at least three independent
174 experiments with error bars representing the standard error of the mean (SEM). Statistical
175 significance was determined by one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) using Graphpad Prism
176 version 5.0c for Mac OS X (GraphPad software, La Jolla, CA).

177 Flow cytometry. *P*. aeruginosa strains carrying green fluorescent protein (GFP)
178 transcriptional reporters (P<sub>exoS-gfp</sub> or P<sub>exsD-gfp</sub>) were cultured overnight in TSB with gentamicin
179 (100 μg/ml) at 37°C. The next day, bacteria were diluted to an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.05 in TSB with EGTA (2
180 mM) and cultured at 30° or 37°C with shaking. At the indicated times cells were collected,
181 diluted to 1x 10<sup>7</sup> cfu/ml in PBS, and GFP fluorescence was measured by counting 10,000
182 bacteria per sample on a Becton Dickinson LSR II at the University of Iowa Flow Cytometry
183 Facility.

184 Electrophoretic mobility shift and DNase I protection assays. Probes for the exsA (255
185 bp), pscF (160bp), exsC (200bp), regA (275bp), and algD (160bp) promoter or coding regions
186 were amplified by PCR using primer pairs 126323955-126639110; 32179291-3349133;
187 22963127-49188917; 33075941-33075940; and 85333731-85333730, respectively. The PCR
188 products were end-labeled with 10 μCi of [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]ATP as previously described (16). Vfr, apo-Vfr,

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

189 and ExsA His were purified as previously described (11, 13, 16). EMSA reactions containing
190 specific and nonspecific probes (0.05 nM), ExsA DNA binding buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 50
191 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 5% glycerol), 25 ng/µl poly(2'-deoxyinosinic-2'-
192 deoxycytidylic acid [poly-dI-dC]), and 100 µg/ml bovine serum albumin were incubated in a total
193 volume of 18 µl for 5 min at 25°C. Where specified, cAMP (adenosine 3',5'-cyclic
194 monophosphate sodium salt monohydrate; Sigma-Aldrich) was added to a final concentration of
195 200 nM. Vfr-cAMP, apo-Vfr, or ExsA (concentrations indicated in the figure legends) was added
196 to a total volume of 20 µl and incubated for an additional 15 min at 25°C. Samples were
197 analyzed by electrophoresis on 5% polyacrylamide glycine gels (10 mM Tris at [pH 7.5], 380
198 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA) at 4°C. Imaging was performed using a FLA-7000 phosphorimager
199 (Fujifilm) and MultiGauge v3.0 software (Fujifilm).
200 The PexsA footprinting probe (237 bp) was generated by PCR amplification with primers
201 129588340 and 126639110. The 129588340 primer was 5' modified with Amino Modifier C6
202 (integrated DNA technologies) to prevent radiolabeling at that end of the promoter probe. Vfr-
203 mediated protection of PexsA from DNasel cleavage and DNA sequencing reactions were
204 performed as previously described (16).
205 mRNA collection and rapid amplification of 5' cDNA ends (5' RACE). *P. aeruginosa*
206 strains were grown overnight on VBM at 37°C. The following day, the bacteria were diluted to an
207 A600 of 0.1 in TSB with EGTA (2 mM) and cultured at 37°C with shaking. RNA was isolated from
208 500 µl aliquots of cell culture using RNAProtect Cell Reagent (Qiagen) and the RNeasy Mini Kit
209 (Qiagen). cDNA was generated from the isolated RNA using SuperScript II Reverse
210 Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and primer 4373912. PCR reactions were performed with primer pair
211 126323955 and 126639110. Genomic DNA and RNA samples not treated with reverse
212 transcriptase served as positive and negative controls for PCR amplification of the PexsCEBA
213 specific fragment, respectively. 5' RACE was performed using the 5' RACE System for Rapid

214 Amplification of cDNA Ends (Invitrogen). First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using exsA

215 132712288 as shown in Fig 4C. The dC-tailed cDNA was PCR amplified with kit provided

216 Abridged Anchor Primer and primer 132712289. Finally, nested PCR amplification with the kit

217 provided Abridged Universal Amplification primer and primer 132712290 was performed, and

220 RESULTS

221 The bistable phenotype for T3SS gene expression is altered in a vfr deletion mutant.

222 The promoter regions for the ExoS effector and the ExsD anti-activator genes (P<sub>exoS</sub> and P<sub>exsD</sub>,

223 respectively) are representative ExsA-dependent promoters. Previous studies found expression

224 of P<sub>exoS-lacZ</sub> and P<sub>exsD-lacZ</sub> transcriptional reporters to be entirely dependent upon exsA and

225 reduced > 8 fold in the absence of vfr when compared to the parental strain PA103 (Fig. 1A)

226 (24). A limitation of lacZ reporters is that the measured activity represents the average of the

227 entire cell population. This can obscure differences in reporter activity occurring at the single cell

228 level. Previous studies using the green fluorescent protein (gfp) as a transcriptional readout of

229 single cell activity found that T3SS gene expression is bistable (23, 28, 29). Bistability results

230 from non-homogeneous gene expression within a cell population (30). To better understand the

231 kinetics of T3SS gene expression at the single cell level, we grew broth cultures of wt, exsA,

232 and vfr strains carrying either a P<sub>exoS-gfp</sub> or P<sub>exsD-gfp</sub> transcriptional reporter overnight under non-

233 permissive conditions (high Ca<sup>2+</sup>, -EGTA) for T3SS gene expression. Flow cytometry verified

234 that the uninduced reporter strains had low levels of fluorescence (data not shown, although

235 evident at the 1 hr timepoint in Fig. 3A). The cells were then diluted to an A<sub>600</sub> of 0.05, cultured

236 under inducing conditions for T3SS gene expression (low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, +EGTA) at 37°C, and samples

237 were harvested every hour and examined by flow cytometry. The exsA mutant cells had low

238 levels of P<sub>exoS-gfp</sub> and P<sub>exsD-gfp</sub> reporter activity following 5 hr of growth (Fig. 2A-B), chosen as a

239 representative timepoint, and activity remained low throughout the entire time course (Fig. 3A).

Marsden et al.

Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

240 In contrast, the wt and *vfr* mutant cells had two distinct peaks of *P*<sub>*exoS-gfp*</sub> and *P*<sub>*exsD-gfp*</sub> reporter
241 activity (Fig. 2C-F) at the 5 hr timepoint. The first peak (coincident with the peak seen with the
242 exsA mutant) represents cells with low reporter activity and the higher intensity peak represents
243 cells with high reporter activity. Time course experiments demonstrate that the kinetic induction
244 of both reporters was delayed in the *vfr* mutant when compared to the wt strain (Fig. 3A).
245 Further examination revealed that the *vfr* mutant had two observable defects in *P*<sub>*exoS-gfp*</sub> and
246 *P*<sub>*exsD-gfp*</sub> reporter activity. First, the fluorescence intensity of the induced *vfr* mutant cells (Fig. 2E-
247 F) was 2-4 fold lower than seen for the wt cells (Fig. 2C-D). Second, a smaller percentage of
248 the *vfr* mutant cells demonstrated fluorescence over the time course (Fig. 3A and 3B). These
249 findings demonstrate that the bistable phenotype is altered in the absence of *vfr*.
250 We also examined the effect of temperature on expression of the *P*<sub>*exoS-gfp*</sub> or *P*<sub>*exsD-gfp*</sub>
251 reporters by comparing cells grown at 30 or 37°C for 5 hours under permissive conditions for
252 T3SS gene expression. Although most of the wt cells were positive for GFP expression when
253 cultured at 37°C, only ~30% were positive when grown at 30°C (Fig. 3). A similar trend was
254 seen with the *vfr* mutant in that more GFP positive cells were observed at 37 versus 30°C. We
255 conclude that the requirement for *vfr* is more stringent for cells when grown at 30°C.
256 Bistability generally involves positive feedback regulation (30). One candidate regulator for
257 bistable control of T3SS gene expression is Vfr itself, which directly autoregulates its own
258 expression (13). To determine whether the Vfr regulon is subject to bistable expression, we
259 constructed a *P*<sub>*lacP1-gfp*</sub> reporter. The *P*<sub>*lacP1*</sub> reporter was previously shown to be Vfr-dependent
260 and a reliable surrogate for expression of the Vfr regulon (32). When assayed in the wt and *vfr*
261 strains, however, the fluorescence intensity was uniform suggesting that the Vfr regulon is not
262 expressed in a bistable manner (Fig. S1).
263 Another potential role for Vfr in bistability could be direct effects on exsA expression, which
264 is controlled by the ExsA-dependent *P*<sub>*exsc*</sub> promoter. To test this possibility, we generated a
265 radiolabeled *P*<sub>*exsc*</sub> promoter probe and tested for Vfr binding in an electrophoretic mobility shift

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

266 assay (EMSA). Although purified Vfr bound to the previously characterized promoter region for  
267 regA (33) (Fig. S2A, lanes 11-13), binding to the \( P_{exsC} \) probe was not detected (lanes 1-4). We  
268 also considered the possibility that Vfr might require ExsA for binding. Whereas ExsA\(_{His}\) bound  
269 to the \( P_{exsC} \) promoter probe, further addition of Vfr had no effect on ExsA\(_{His}\) binding activity (Fig.  
270 S2, lanes 5-8). We conclude that Vfr does not regulate T3SS gene expression through direct  
271 effects on \( P_{exsC} \) promoter activity.  

272 Identification of the \( P_{exsA} \) promoter. A recent RNAseq study of *P. aeruginosa* strain PA14  
273 grown at \( 37^\circ \mathrm{C} \) identified a transcript with a 5' triphosphate originating in the exsB-exsA  
274 intergenic region (4). Prior to that finding no promoters were known to exist in the intergenic  
275 region (IR). To independently verify the RNAseq finding, we performed 5' RACE with RNA  
276 isolated from strain PA103 cultured under inducing conditions for T3SS gene expression and  
277 identified the same transcriptional start site to within 2 nt of the previous report (Fig. 4A-B). No  
278 additional start sites were mapped within the IR, suggesting that the region contains a single  
279 promoter (designated herein as \( P_{exsA} \)). The region upstream of the transcription start site has  
280 several putative -10 TATAAT boxes, but lacks an obvious -35 box (Fig. 4B). The latter  
281 observation suggests a potential requirement for a transcriptional activator. In support of that  
282 conclusion, we found a strong match to the Vfr consensus-binding site that was centered at the  
283 -41 position (Fig. 4B).  

284 To determine whether the \( P_{exsA} \) promoter is controlled by Vfr, a transcriptional reporter (\( P_{exsA} \)-  
285 lacZ, -193 to +18 region relative to the \( P_{exsA} \) transcription start site [Fig. 4A]) was introduced into  
286 wt cells and the vfr mutant. Weak \( P_{exsA-lacZ} \) reporter activity was observed in the wt background  
287 (Fig. 5A) and that activity was significantly reduced in the vfr deletion mutant. \( P_{exsA-lacZ} \) reporter  
288 activity was similar under both non-inducing and inducing conditions for T3SS gene expression.  
289 Because \( P_{exsA-lacZ} \) reporter activity was low, we included an additional reporter lacking a cloned  
290 promoter and found that both the promoterless and \( P_{exsA-lacZ} \) reporters had similar activity in the  
291 vfr mutant (Fig. 5A). Exogenous expression of vfr from a plasmid stimulated \( P_{exsA-lacZ} \) reporter

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

292 activity in both the wt and vfr backgrounds to levels higher than seen in the wt strain carrying a
293 vector control (Fig. 5B). The latter finding suggests that Vfr activity is limiting in wt cells. These
294 combined data suggest that P<sub>exsA</sub> reporter activity is entirely Vfr-dependent and not influenced
295 by addition of EGTA to the growth medium (T3SS inducing conditions).
296 P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter activity is not subject to autoregulatory control by ExsA. Previous
297 studies concluded that ExsA autoregulates its own expression through activation of the P<sub>exsC</sub>
298 promoter and generation of a polycistronic mRNA encoding exsCEBA (Fig. 4A) (19). The
299 discovery of the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter raised the possibility that the transcript originating from the P<sub>exsC</sub>
300 promoter terminates prior to reaching exsA and that exsA transcription is driven entirely from the
301 P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter. To test this possibility, we isolated RNA from wt and exsA mutant cells,
302 generated cDNA, and performed a PCR reaction using the primers outlined in Fig. 4C. The PCR
303 primers were positioned upstream and downstream of the P<sub>exsA</sub> transcription start site and
304 should only yield a 255bp product from transcripts originating upstream of P<sub>exsA</sub>. The expected
305 product was detected by PCR when using RNA isolated from wt cells but not from the exsA
306 mutant (Fig. 6). These findings are consistent with previous data concluding that exsCEBA are
307 transcribed as an operon from the ExsA-dependent P<sub>exsC</sub> promoter. Nevertheless, it seemed
308 possible that ExsA might also influence P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter activity as a further mechanism of
309 autoregulation. This does not appear to be the case, however, as P<sub>exsA-lacZ</sub> reporter activity is not
310 significantly altered in an exsA mutant (Fig. S2B) or under T3SS inducing conditions (Fig. 5A)
311 and ExsA binding to the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter probe alone or in combination with Vfr was not detected
312 (Fig. S2C).
313 Vfr directly controls P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter activity. To determine whether Vfr controls P<sub>exsA</sub>
314 promoter activity directly, we performed EMSA experiments with a radiolabeled P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter
315 probe and purified Vfr. Incubation of the P<sub>exsA</sub> probe with increasing amounts of Vfr resulted in
316 dose-dependent formation of a Vfr-P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter probe complex (Fig. 7A, lanes 3-8). The
317 affinity for complex formation (K<sub>eq</sub> ~100nM) is similar to other Vfr interactions that have been

318 measured (11). The mobility of a non-specific probe (derived from pscF) was not altered in the
319 presence of Vfr demonstrating that binding to the P<sub>exsA</sub> probe is specific (Fig. 7A). Although the
320 DNA binding activity of Vfr is usually cAMP-dependent, Vfr binding to the lasR promoter region
321 was previously shown to be cAMP-independent (13). The cAMP requirement for P<sub>exsA</sub> binding
322 was examined using apo-Vfr as previously described (13). Binding of apo-Vfr to the P<sub>exsA</sub> probe
323 was strictly dependent upon cAMP addition (Fig. 7A, lanes 9 vs 10). The interaction of Vfr with
324 the P<sub>exsA</sub> probe, therefore, is typical of most Vfr promoter interactions in being cAMP-dependent.
325 The location of the Vfr binding site in the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter region was determined by DNase I
326 footprinting. In the presence of Vfr, a 24 bp area of protection was observed and that region was
327 centered on the predicted Vfr consensus-binding site (Fig. 4B and 7C). Furthermore, the
328 nucleotides located in the core of the conserved regions demonstrated hypersensitivity to
329 DNase I cleavage (Fig. 7C, indicated with an asterisk). This hypersensitivity pattern is a
330 signature typical of Vfr binding interactions and likely results from Vfr-induced DNA bending (11,
331 13).

332 To further verify that Vfr interacts directly with the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter region, we generated a
333 transcriptional reporter and a promoter probe, referred to as P<sub>exsAm-lacZ</sub> and P<sub>exsAm</sub>, respectively,
334 in which the Vfr consensus binding site was mutagenized as outlined in Fig. 4B. P<sub>exsAm-lacZ</sub>
335 reporter activity was the same in both the wt and vfr backgrounds, and similar to the activity
336 seen for the wt P<sub>exsA-lacZ</sub> reporter when measured in the vfr mutant (Fig. 5A). In contrast to our
337 findings with the P<sub>exsA-lacZ</sub> reporter, P<sub>exsAm-lacZ</sub> reporter activity was not stimulated by expressing
338 vfr from a plasmid (Fig. 5B). Finally, binding of Vfr to the P<sub>exsAm</sub> promoter probe could not be
339 detected in EMSA experiments (Fig. 7B). These combined findings confirm that Vfr contributes
340 to T3SS gene expression through a direct binding interaction with the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter region. To
341 determine whether regulation of P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter activity by Vfr fully accounts for reduced T3SS
342 gene expression in the vfr deletion mutant, we introduced the same Vfr binding site mutations
343 depicted in Fig. 4B onto the chromosome of wt PA103, resulting in strain BSM (for binding site

mutant). ExsA-dependent \(P_{\text{exoS-lacZ}}\) and \(P_{\text{exsD-lacZ}}\) reporter activity was examined under T3SS

inducing growth conditions. When compared to the *vfr* mutant, the BSM mutant had a

reproducible reduction in \(P_{\text{exoS-lacZ}}\) activity (though not reaching significance) and a significant

defect in \(P_{\text{exsD-lacZ}}\) reporter activity (Fig. 8). This finding was contrary to our expectation that the

BSM mutant would phenocopy the *vfr* mutant. One possible explanation is that the mutations

used to disrupt the Vfr binding site may also interfere with the inherent basal activity of the

promoter (i.e., Vfr-independent activity). The typical way to test this is to measure wt and mutant

promoter activity in the absence of the activator (i.e., *vfr*). Unfortunately, the promoter is entirely

devoid of activity in the absence of *vfr* (Fig. 5A) making it impossible to ascertain the effect of

the mutations on inherent promoter activity. Thus, our data demonstrate that Vfr regulates T3SS

gene expression through its effects on \(P_{\text{exsA}}\) promoter activity and suggest that an additional Vfr-

controlled activity and/or an unknown function of the exsB-exsA intergenic region also

contributes to T3SS gene expression.

DISCUSSION

The exsCEBA genes were originally characterized as an operon transcribed from an ExsA-

dependent promoter located upstream of exsC (19). Data from two recent studies suggest that

exsA transcription is more complex than previously appreciated and controlled by at least one

additional promoter. The first study identified a transcript originating in the exsB-exsA intergenic

region using an RNAseq approach (4) and the second identified a VqsM-dependent promoter

located in the same region (34). In the present study, we identified and characterized a Vfr-

dependent promoter (\(P_{\text{exsA}}\)), also located within the exsB-exsA intergenic region. In 5′RACE

experiments, we identified two nucleotides as candidate transcription start sites for the \(P_{\text{exsA}}\)

promoter (Fig. 4B). Those nucleotides are adjacent to the start site previously mapped by

RNAseq (4). Although it is unlikely that all three nucleotide represent authentic start sites, we

conclude that they collectively represent the general start site for \(P_{\text{exsA}}\) transcription initiation.

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

support of this, there are several strong matches to -10 TATAAT boxes appropriately positioned

just upstream of the candidate start sites (Fig. 4B). A start site for the VqsM-dependent

promoter was not determined in the previous study but the VqsM binding site was mapped by

DNase I footprinting (34). The mapped binding site, however, is centered ~12 bp downstream of

the start sites mapped by 5' RACE and RNAseq. This position is inconsistent with VqsM having

a positive effect on \(P_{exsA}\) promoter activity and suggests that the VqsM- and Vfr-dependent

promoters are distinct from one another.

Transcriptional reporter assays showed that \(P_{exsA-lacZ}\) reporter activity is significantly reduced

in a *vfr* mutant when compared to the parental strain (Fig. 5A). Important to note is that \(P_{exsA}\)

promoter activity is quite weak (~200 CPRG units). When compared to a promoterless reporter,

which served as a negative control, \(P_{exsA-lacZ}\) reporter activity was only ~2-fold above the

background level of activity (Fig. 5A). Disruption of the Vfr binding site reduced \(P_{exsA-lacZ}\) reporter

activity to background levels leading us to conclude that \(P_{exsA}\) promoter activity is entirely Vfr-

dependent. The Vfr effect on \(P_{exsA}\) promoter activity results from a direct binding interaction as

determined in EMSA experiments (Fig. 6A) and DNase I cleavage assays (Fig. 6B), where Vfr

protected the -52 to -27 portion of the promoter region (Fig. 4B). Binding of Vfr to this region of

the promoter, coupled with the lack of a strong match to a -35 consensus site, is consistent with

a mechanism wherein Vfr stimulates \(P_{exsA}\) promoter activity by assisting in the recruitment of

RNA polymerase.

Identification of the \(P_{exsA}\) promoter prompted us to reexamine the autoregulatory properties

of ExsA. Although ExsA-dependent control of the \(P_{exsC}\) promoter has been well established (16,

19), evidence that the transcript originating from the \(P_{exsC}\) promoter includes exsA was lacking.

Using a PCR approach, we identified signal for an mRNA species that minimally spans the \(P_{exsA}\)

transcription start site and includes exsA (Figs. 4C and 7). Consistent with previous reports that

ExsA autoregulates its own expression, the mRNA was not detected in an exsA mutant. We

took this as further evidence that exsA is included on a transcript originating upstream of the

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter. Because no additional start sites were detected within the exsCEB coding regions in the previous RNAseq experiment (4), the transcript is likely derived from the P<sub>exsC</sub> promoter. Binding of ExsA to P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter probe was not detected and P<sub>exsA-lacZ</sub> reporter activity was not significantly altered in an exsA mutant. The relative contribution of P<sub>exsA</sub> to the absolute level of exsA transcript is not entirely clear, but given the weak expression of P<sub>exsA-lacZ</sub> relative to the P<sub>exsC-lacZ</sub> reporter, a difference of at least 20-fold (data not shown), we propose that most exsA-containing mRNA in the cell is derived from the P<sub>exsC</sub> promoter. Taken together, these data further support the model that ExsA autoregulates its own expression solely through activation of the P<sub>exsC</sub> promoter.

Autoregulation of exsA expression by ExsA and the control of ExsA activity by the ExsCED regulatory cascade result in a finely balanced regulatory mechanism. The current working model is that ExsD prevents high levels of ExsA-dependent transcription under non-inducing conditions (21). Inherent to the system seems to be a stochastic component wherein the negative regulatory activity of ExsD is relieved in only a fraction of the cells under inducing condition. The latter feature likely accounts for the bistable phenotype and could be altered by factors that influence the expression, synthesis, and/or activity of ExsA. For example, factors such as osmolarity and the metabolic status of cells were previously shown to alter the bistable phenotype for T3SS gene expression (23). A key finding from the latter study was that the percentage of cells expressing the T3SS was positively correlated with intracellular levels of cAMP. Our findings that bistability is altered in the vfr mutant and that Vfr controls exsA expression are consistent with the idea that fluctuations in cAMP influence the bistable phenotype. Bistability does not appear to be an inherent property of Vfr-dependent control, however, because the P<sub>lacP1-gfp</sub> reporter demonstrated uniform expression in single cell studies (Fig. S1). Rather, Vfr-dependent stimulation of exsA expression likely alters the stochastic balance of the system resulting in a larger proportion of wt cells being positive for T3SS gene expression when compared to a vfr mutant.

Marsden et al. Vfr control of T3SS gene expression

422 Two unresolved questions remain. First, aside from altering the bistable phenotype, vfr
423 deletion also resulted in a 2-4 fold reduction in the fluorescence intensity of the P<sub>exoS-gfp</sub> and
424 P<sub>exsD-gfp</sub> reporters (Fig. 2). Given the weak activity of the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter we had expected that the
425 Vfr requirement for exsA expression would be alleviated in cells induced for T3SS gene
426 expression (i.e., GFP positive) owing to ExsA-dependent expression of the exsCEBA mRNA
427 from the much stronger P<sub>exsC</sub> promoter (Fig. 4A). The second question is why the BSM mutant
428 has a larger defect in P<sub>exoS-lacZ</sub> and P<sub>exsD-lacZ</sub> reporter activity when compared to the vfr mutant
429 (Fig. 5C). Several distinct roles have now been described for the exsB-exsA intergenic region.
430 The region contains Vfr-and VqsM-dependent promoters (34), and contributes to post-
431 transcriptional regulation of ExsA expression by the DeaD RNA-dependent helicase (35) and
432 the small RNA binding protein RsmA (36). The nucleotide substitutions used to disrupt the Vfr-
433 binding site, therefore, may have also altered exsCEBA mRNA stability, post-transcriptional
434 effects on ExsA synthesis, or impaired the inherent activity of the P<sub>exsA</sub> promoter (i.e., Vfr-
435 independent). Understanding the contributions of the exsB-exsA intergenic region to T3SS gene
436 expression will be the subject of future studies.

Figure 8. Disruption of the Vfr binding site on the chromosome prevents T3SS gene  
expression. *P*. aeruginosa strains PA103 (wt), the *vfr* mutant, and the *vfr* binding site mutant  
(BSM) carrying chromosomally integrated P<sub>exoS-lacZ</sub> or P<sub>exsD-lacZ</sub> transcriptional reporters were  
grown under inducing conditions (low Ca<sup>2+</sup>, +EGTA) for T3SS gene expression at 37°C to an  
A<sub>600</sub> of 1.0 and assayed for β-galactosidase activity. The experiment contains the same data  
shown in Fig. 1A for wt and the *vfr* mutant. The reported values (Miller units) represent the  
mean of at least three experiments. *, P < 0.001.* All of the data reported in this figure represent  
the mean of at least three experiments.
