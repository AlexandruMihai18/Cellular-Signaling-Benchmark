Gentamicin is a broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic widely used to treat life-threatening bacterial infections. The gentamicin C complex consists of gentamicin C1, gentamicin C1a, and epimers gentamicin C2 and gentamicin C2a. At present there is a generally accepted pathway of gentamicin biosynthesis, except for detailed understanding of the epimerization process involving gentamicins C2 and C2a. Here we have investigated the biosynthesis of these epimers. Jl-20B—an intermediate in the gentamicin biosynthetic pathway—and its epimer Jl-20Ba were generated by in-frame deletion within genP, which encodes a phosphotransferase that catalyzes the first step of 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation in gentamicin biosynthesis. GenB1 and GenB2 are aminotransferases with different substrate specificities and enantioselectivities. Jl-20Ba, containing a 6′S chiral amine, a precursor of gentamicin C2a, was synthesized from G418 by GenQ/GenB1 through sequential oxidation/transamination at C-6′. GenQ/GenB2 catalyzed the synthesis of Jl-20B, containing a 6′R chiral amine, a precursor of gentamicin C2, from G418. GenB2 catalyzed the epimerization of Jl-20Ba/Jl-20B and of gentamicins C2a/C2.

## Introduction

Gentamicin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic produced by *Microomonospora echinospora*,[1] is a complex mixture of four major compounds—gentamicins C1, C1a, C2a, and C2—and numerous minor compounds such as gentamicin C2b. Gentamicin belongs to the group of 4,6-disubstituted 2-deoxystreptamine (DOS) aminoglycoside antibiotics; its chemical structure consists of the core aminocyclitol moiety 2-DOS, together with purpuromine and garosamine linked to positions C-4 and C-6, respectively. The differences between the four major compounds are to be found in the purpuromine component (Scheme 1).

Gentamicin is widely used to treat bacterial infections, particularly those caused by Gram-negative bacteria.[2,3] Its bactericidal activity is based on selective binding to the bacterial 16S rRNA A-site (decoding aminoacyl site) and interfering with initiation and translation fidelity during protein synthesis. Gentamicin is also used as a therapeutic agent to treat human genetic disorders caused by nonsense mutations.[4,5]

The emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria[6,7] caused by antibiotic abuse, together with the lack of new antibiotics, mean that it is likely that aminoglycosides will continue to be in demand because of their low cost and high antibacterial activity. Unfortunately, gentamicin causes serious side effects such as ototoxicity and renal toxicity, and this restricts its wide clinical application. Commercial gentamicin is a mixture of gentamicins C1 and C1a and the epimers C2a and C2. Surprisingly, it has been reported that C2, which has the same bactericidal efficacy as C2a, exhibits no nephrotoxicity and little cellular toxicity.[8] Therefore, the biosynthesis of C2a and C2 as a prerequisite for obtaining gentamicin with a particular composition appears worth investigating. The DNA sequence of the gentamicin biosynthetic gene cluster (GenBank accession numbers AY524043 and AJ628149) in *M. echinospora* has provided the basis for determining the complete biosynthetic pathway.[9]

The established gentamicin biosynthetic pathway (Scheme 1) branches at gentamicin X2, with one branch producing Jl-20A and C1a and C2b, and the other producing G418, Jl-20B, and C2a, C2, and C1. GenK is a C-6′ methyltransferase that converts gentamicin X2 into G418.[10] Gentamicin X2 and G418 are converted into Jl-20A and Jl-20B, respectively, through coupled oxidation/transamination reactions. GenQ catalyzes the oxidation of X2 and G418.[11,12] GenP catalyzes the 3′-OH phosphorylation step of Jl-20A, which is possibly the first step for C-3′ dehydroxylation.[13]

Recently, four potential aminotransferase-encoding genes—genB1, genB2, genB3, and genB4—in the gentamicin gene cluster have been reported.[11] In the formation of Jl-20A and Jl-20B, transamination is mainly catalyzed by GenB1, whereas GenB2 catalyzes the epimerization between C2a and C2; C2a here is the first product of Jl-20B bisdehydroxylation. GenB3 and GenB4 participate in the 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation of Jl-20A and Jl-20B.

However, many details in the biosynthetic pathway to gentamicins C2a and C2 are not fully understood. Thus, it is unclear

Compound G418 is first converted into JI-20B, with the same 6′-chiral carbon as is present in gentamicins C2a and C2.[11] In this study, as expected, in-frame deletion within genP, blocking the gentamicin pathway at JI-20A and JI-20B, resulted in the generation of the pair of epimers JI-20Ba and JI-20B (Scheme 1). The analysis of metabolites produced by mutant strains generated by single or double in-frame deletions in the genB1, genB2, and genP genes, together with the results of in vivo biotransformation experiments and in vitro enzymatic reactions, suggest a parallel biosynthetic pathway for the epimer pair C2a/C2, having branched at G418 (Scheme 1). JI-20Ba, containing a 6'S chiral amine, is a precursor of C2a and was synthesized from G418 by GenQ/GenB1 through sequential oxidation/transamination at C-6'. JI-20B, containing a 6'R chiral amine, is a precursor of C2 and was synthesized from G418 by GenQ/GenB2, whereas GenB2 catalyzed the epimerization of JI-20Ba/JI-20B and of C2a/C2.

### Results

#### In-frame deletion of genP in M. echinospora resulted in the synthesis of JI-20A, JI-20B, and epimer JI-20Ba

GenP catalyzes 3'-OH phosphorylation of JI-20A. This is possibly the first step of 3',4'-bisdehydroxylation in gentamicin biosynthesis.[13] When we introduced an in-frame deletion in genP of the M. echinospora wild-type (WT) strain, the phenotypic characteristics of the mutant ΔgenP strain, including colony color and shape, mycelium morphology, and growth rates, were not changed. Metabolites in the medium were then purified, concentrated, and subjected to HPLC analysis to assess gentamicin production. Unlike in the case of the WT strain, the gentamicin C complex was undetectable in the culture medium of the ΔgenP strain; however, three new peaks that

whether other aminotransferases participate in the biosynthesis of C2a and C2, whether C2a is the only C2 precursor, whether the isomerization of C2a to C2 occurs only in the last steps, and whether GenB2 can catalyze the epimerization of JI-20B with the same 6′-chiral carbon as in gentamicin C2 to generate the other conformation.

were eluted earlier than gentamicin C1a were detected (Figure 1 A). High-resolution electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (HR-ESI-MS) analysis of the three products indicated that the first peak was JI-20A ($\mathrm{C}_{19} \mathrm{H}_{40} \mathrm{~N}_{5} \mathrm{O}_{9}$, $m / z$ 482.2823), and the molecular weights of the other two products were equal to those of JI-20B ($\mathrm{C}_{20} \mathrm{H}_{42} \mathrm{~N}_{5} \mathrm{O}_{9}$, $m / z$ 496.2979 and 496.2966; Figure 1 F). The chemical structures of the last two products—designated JI-20Ba and JI-20Bb—were then characterized by ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$, ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C},{ }^{1} \mathrm{H},{ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$ COSY, HSQC and NOESY NMR analyses (Figure 2, Table 1, and Figures S1–S10 in the Supporting Information).

The NMR spectra of compounds JI-20Ba and JI-20Bb were measured in deuterium oxide ($\mathrm{D}_{2} \mathrm{O}$); ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$ and ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ NMR spectral data were assigned by analyses of ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H},{ }^{13} \mathrm{C},{ }^{1} \mathrm{H},{ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$ COSY, and HSQC NMR spectra (Table 1). The methyl group linked to $\mathrm{C}-6^{\prime}$ in JI-20Ba demonstrated a chemical shift $\delta_{\mathrm{c}}=15.11 \mathrm{ppm}$; the shift for $\mathrm{C}-5^{\prime}$ at $\delta_{\mathrm{c}}=78.43 \mathrm{ppm}$ was also observed. Meanwhile, spectral data for $\mathrm{C} 6^{\prime}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{C}-5^{\prime}$ in JI-20Bb were observed at $\delta_{\mathrm{c}}=11.31$ and $77.06 \mathrm{ppm}$.

Comparison of the NMR spectral data for JI-20Ba and JI-20Bb with those reported for C2a and C2, [14] together with analysis of HPLC and HR-ESI-MS data, indicated that compounds JI-20Ba and JI-20Bb were epimers with different configurations at $\mathrm{C}-6^{\prime}$.

The stereochemistry of JI-20Ba and JI-20Bb was analyzed on the basis of their NOESY spectra (Figure 2, Figures S5 and S10). The presence of key NOE correlations between $\mathrm{C} 6^{\prime}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}-3^{\prime}$ and $\mathrm{H}-5^{\prime}$ in the structure of JI-20Ba suggested the $\alpha$ -orientation of the methyl group, whereas NOE correlation between $\mathrm{C} 6^{\prime}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{H}-4^{\prime}$ in the structure of JI-20Bb suggested $\mathrm{C} 6^{\prime}-\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ in $\beta$ -orientation. By the Cahn–Ingold–Prelog rule, we can thus confirm the absolute configurations of the $6^{\prime}$-chiral carbons in JI-20Ba and JI-20Bb as $S$ and $R$, respectively.

To determine whether the in-frame deletion in the genP gene influenced the functional activity of other genes and was responsible for metabolic changes in the mutant strain, we constructed the complementary pEAPP plasmid containing genP. When pEAPP was introduced into the $\Delta$genP strain, the gentamicin C complex was synthesized, thus indicating that genP encodes a key enzyme for the $3^{\prime}, 4^{\prime}$-bisdehydroxylation of JI-20A and JI-20B (Figure 1 A).

It was proposed that GenP catalyzes the first step of $3^{\prime}, 4^{\prime}$-bisdehydroxylation in gentamicin biosynthesis, because the deletion of genP inhibited the gentamicin metabolic pathway at JI-20A and JI-20B. A previous study has reported the isolation of JI-20B and its epimer TPJ-B from $M$. sagamiensis.[15] JI-20Bb with the $6^{\prime} R$ chiral amine corresponds to JI-20B, as was commonly thought. In this study, we have identified JI-20Ba with a $6^{\prime} S$ chiral amine—the epimer of JI-20B—for the first time. Our findings indicate that epimerization occurs not only for gentamicins C2a and C2, but also for the intermediates.

Pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent aminotransferases GenB1 and GenB2 catalyze the biosynthesis of JI-20Ba and JI-20B, respectively

To examine the synthesis of JI-20Ba and JI-20B, genB1 and genB2 were separately deleted in the genP mutant, and culture media were analyzed for gentamicin secretion. The phenotypic characteristics of the two obtained double mutants—$\Delta$genP$\Delta$genB1 and $\Delta$genP$\Delta$genB2—were not changed. According to HPLC analysis, the JI-20Ba and JI-20B content in the $\Delta$genP$\Delta$genB1 culture was 7.2 and $86.1 \%$, respectively, in comparison with 22.5 and $74.1 \%$, respectively, in the $\Delta$genP culture; JI-20B was not detected in the $\Delta$genP$\Delta$genB2 culture

medium (Figure 1 A, B and Table 2). A new peak appeared between JI-20A and JI-20Ba, and its identity was confirmed as G418. These results suggest that JI-20Ba was synthesized regardless of GenB1 expression. However, when GenB1 was inactive, the production of JI-20Ba decreased. JI-20B was synthesized from G418 only when GenB2 was expressed.

The effect of double deletion of genB1 and genB2 in the biosynthetic gene cluster was investigated. The phenotypic characteristics of the ΔgenB2ΔgenB1 mutant were not changed. HPLC analysis of gentamicin secretion in culture medium showed that the double mutant accumulated G418 and gentamicin C1a, but not C2a, C2, and C1 (Figure 1C and F), thus indicating that the ΔgenB2ΔgenB1 strain synthesized G418 but not JI-20Ba or JI-20B. These results indicated that GenB1 and GenB2 catalyzed the synthesis of JI-20B and its epimer JI-20Ba from G418. No other aminotransferases in *M. echinospora* were able to substitute the activity of GenB1 and GenB2 in this step. G418 is the common precursor of JI-20Ba and JI-20B.

The conversion of G418 to JI-20B (and JI-20Ba) is performed in a two-step oxidation/transamination process. GenQ is a flavin-dependent dehydrogenase that oxidizes G418 to 6′-dehydro-6′-oxo-G418.[11] Purified recombinant GenQ, GenB1, and GenB2 proteins (Figure S11) were used for enzymatic reactions in vitro. GenQ/GenB1 catalyzed the conversion of G418 into JI-20Ba, whereas GenQ/GenB2 catalyzed the conversion of G418 into JI-20B and JI-20Ba (Figure 3A). Together with the results obtained by in vivo mutagenesis, these data indicate that GenB1 directly catalyzed the synthesis of JI-20Ba from G418. In contrast, the aminotransferase function of GenB2 appeared to be complex. In the oxidation reactions with GenQ, only G418 was detected as the reaction product. The dehydrogenation product of G418 is 6′-dehydro-6′-oxo-G418; it is unstable and

GenB2 also catalyzes the epimerization of gentamicins C2a and C2

To allow further examination of the functions of GenB1 and GenB2 in the biosynthesis of C2a and C2, *genB1* and *genB2* were separately knocked out by in-frame deletion in the WT strain. The phenotypic characteristics of the mutants Δ*genB1* and Δ*genB2* were not changed. The Δ*genB1* mutant generated C2a and C2 in yields of 30.6 and 20.9 %, in comparison with 24.0 and 45.1 %, respectively, in the WT strain (Table 2), and also synthesized JI-20B and a new product designated ZL101 (Figure 1 D). Δ*genB2* produced C1a and C2a along with ZL101, whereas C1 and C2 were undetectable (Figure 1 E). Mutant strains Δ*genB1*, Δ*genB2*, and Δ*genB2ΔgenB1* all produced C1a; this was consistent with a recent study on the functions of GenB1 and GenB2 in the gentamicin biosynthetic pathway,[11] but we did not delve into the functions of GenB1 and GenB2 in gentamicin C1a biosynthesis.

Complementation experiments were also performed. The introduction of pEAPB1 into the Δ*genB1* mutant restored the production nearly to the WT levels, whereas the introduction of pEAPB2 into the Δ*genB2* mutant led to the production of gentamicins C1 and C2; this strongly supports a critical role for GenB2 in the biosynthesis of C1 and C2 (Figure 1 D and E). The introduction of pEAPB1 or pEAPB2 into the WT strain did not affect gentamicin production (data not shown). In the complementation experiments, the production was not restored to the WT levels, because the genes were expressed under the control of the *PermE** promoter, which was likely to result in reduced expression.

These data indicate that GenB2 was essential for gentamicin C2 biosynthesis and that C2 and C2a were generated when GenB2 was expressed. Gentamicin C1 was produced from gentamicin C2 by methylation of C6′-NH₂, which is consistent with the results of a previous study.[14]

Figure 3. HPLC analyses of enzymatic products in vitro and biotransformation products in vivo. A) Aminotransferase activity of GenB1 and GenB2 in vitro. JI-20Ba was formed from G418 by the coupled reaction of GenQ/GenB1, whereas JI-20Ba and JI-20B were both formed by the coupled reaction of GenQ/GenB2. JI-20Ba in the second reaction was formed from JI-20B by GenB2. B) Deamination activity of GenB1 and GenB2 with regard to JI-20Ba and JI-20B; G418 is the deaminated product. GenB1 deaminated JI-20Ba but not JI-20B; GenB2 deaminated JI-20B but not JI-20Ba. JI-20B in the GenB2 + JI-20Ba reaction mixture and JI-20Ba in the GenB2 + JI-20B reaction mixture were epimerization products of GenB2. C) Deamination activity of GenB1 and GenB2 with regard to C2a and C2; ZL101 is the deaminated product. GenB1 deaminated C2a but not C2, and GenB2 deaminated C2 but not C2a. Gentamicin C2 in the GenB2 + C2a reaction mixture and C2a in the GenB2 + C2 reaction mixture were epimerization products of GenB2. D) Epimerization activity of GenB1 and GenB2 with regard to JI-20Ba and JI-20B. GenB2 catalyzed the epimerization of both substrates and formed a mixture of JI-20Ba and JI-20B with prevalence of JI-20B. GenB1 did not demonstrate any epimerase activity. E) Epimerization activity of GenB1 and GenB2 with regard to C2a and C2. GenB2 catalyzed the epimerization of both substrates and formed a mixture of C2a and C2 with prevalence of C2a. GenB1 did not demonstrate any epimerase activity. In control groups, enzyme(s) were not added to the reaction mixture. F) Biotransformation of C2a by the Δ*genK* strain (C1a 35.67 %, C2 22.52 %, C2b 9.52 %, C2a 24.23 %, and C1 8.06 %) and of C2 by the Δ*genK* strain (C1a 36.37 %, C2 31.22 %, C2b 9.24 %, C2a 13.86 %, and C1 9.31 %). The relative amount of each peak product was calculated by the area normalization method.

Biotransformation experiments were performed with a ΔgenK mutant characterized by high levels of gentamicin C1a and low levels of gentamicin C2b [17] to validate the interconversion between C2a and C2 in vivo. When GenB2 enzymatic activity was assessed in the ΔgenK mutant, we observed that C2a was converted into C2 and C1, whereas C2 was converted into C2a and C1 (Figure 3F), thus indicating that the epimerization of C2a to afford C2 is a reversible reaction.

In the enzymatic reactions in vitro, GenB2 catalyzed interconversion between C2a and C2; this indicated epimerase activity (Figure 3E). [11] The same experiments were performed with GenB1, but no epimerase activity was detected. Without the enzyme and coenzyme, only the substrate was detected in the attempted epimerization reaction of C2a/C2 (data not shown).

ZL101 is the deaminated product of gentamicins C2a and C2

We tested deamination of C2a and C2 by GenB1 and GenB2 (when α-ketoglutarate, pyruvic acid, and oxaloacetic acid were used as amino-acceptors, identical results were obtained). GenB1 converted C2a into ZL101 but did not demonstrate any detectable reaction with C2. GenB2 catalyzed the conversion of C2a into C2 but not to ZL101, and that of C2 into both C2a and ZL101 (Figure 3C). Thus, GenB2 catalyzes the epimerization between gentamicins C2a and C2. GenB1 and GenB2 can only catalyze the deamination of C2a and C2, respectively, thus suggesting that ZL101 is the product of deamination of C2a and C2. Without amino acceptor, or coenzyme, only the substrate was detected in the attempted deamination reaction of gentamicins C2a/C2 (data not shown).

The molecular weight of ZL101 was 444, according to the results of low-resolution (LR) ESI-MS analysis (Figure S12). The peak at *m/z* 322, which indicated the loss of the purpuromine ring, further indicated that ZL101 was a gentamicin analogue. [18,19] A minor component of the gentamicin complex with the same molecular weight (*C*₂₀H₃₆N₄O₇) had been discovered by Bérdy et al. (1977). [20] In the present study, HR-ESI-MS analysis of ZL101 (Figure 1F) indicated that the *m/z* value of the protonated molecule (445.2649) is consistent with the molecular formula.

In the ¹H NMR spectrum of ZL101 (Figure S13), resonances at δ = 5.13 (m, 1H), 4.94 (d, *J* = 3.6 Hz, 1H), 4.39 (d, *J* = 2.4 Hz, 1H), 4.23 (m, 1H), 2.67 (s, 3H), and 1.16 ppm (s, 3H) were characteristic of protons 1′ (anomeric proton of the purpuromine part), 1″ (anomeric proton of the garosamine part), 5′-, 2″-, 3″-N-CH₃, and 4″-C-CH₃ groups of the garosamine part. A multiplet at δ = 1.53 ppm was characteristic of H-2<sub>eq</sub> in the 2-deoxy-streptamine ring. Because there is no proton at 6′-C, a 6′-C-CH₃ singlet at δ 1.75 ppm was not split as in JI-20Ba and JI-20B. The results of HR-ESI-MS together with the data on fragment peaks obtained by LR-ESI-MS confirmed the identity of ZL101 as compound I-1 discovered by Bérdy et al. [20]

We therefore hypothesized that the direct deamination product of gentamicins C2a and C2 was 6′-deamino-6′-oxogentamicin C2a (or C2), which is unstable and may readily undergo

reaction between the 6′-carbonyl group and 2′-amino group, resulting in the loss of one water molecule and the generation of ZL101. Thus, ZL101 is a stable Schiff base, which was not metabolized (Scheme 2).

On the basis of these findings, we propose a new parallel biosynthetic pathway for the epimer pair gentamicins C2a/C2, which is branched at G418 and regulated by GenB1 and GenB2, enzymes with differential activity, substrate specificity, and enantioselectivity. The PLP-dependent aminotransferases GenB1 and GenB2 catalyze C-6′-amination in JI-20Ba and JI-20B, respectively, and these are then converted into C2a and C2, respectively, after 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation. GenB2 also acts as an epimerase for the pairs JI-20Ba/JI-20B and gentamicins C2a/C2.

Scheme 2. Proposed synthesis of ZL101. The direct deamination product of gentamicins C2a and C2 was 6′-deamino-6′-oxogentamicin C2a (or C2). ZL101 is a stable Schiff base, a product of intramolecular condensation of 6′-deamino-6′-oxogentamicin C2a (or C2).

## Discussion

Although the gentamicin biosynthesis gene cluster in *M. echinospora* ATCC15835 was defined in 2004, the detailed synthetic mechanism for gentamicin epimers C2a and C2 remained to be determined. Here, we have revealed a new biosynthetic pathway for these epimers that branches off at G418; it involves the modification of the 6′-chiral carbon and is mediated by GenB1 and GenB2 with differential functional activities.
(Schemes 1 and 2), thus suggesting that homologous enzymes in the same pathway can possess significantly different catalytic properties.

This biosynthetic pathway for gentamicins C2a, C2, and C1, containing 6′-chiral carbon, branches at G418. JI-20Ba and JI-20B are synthesized simultaneously from 6′-dehydro-6′-oxo-G418. GenB1 is an S-selective transaminase that generates JI-20Ba, containing a 6′S chiral amine. ${}^{[21-24]}$ This is then converted into gentamicin C2a after 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation. GenB2 is an R-selective transaminase generating JI-20B, containing the 6′R chiral amine, and this is then converted into gentamicin C2 after 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation (Scheme 1). Furthermore, GenB2 catalyzes the epimerization of JI-20Ba/JI-20B and gentamicins C2a/C2, which favors the formation of JI-20B and gentamicin C2a with the 6′R or 6′S conformation, respectively.

The double mutant ΔgenB2ΔgenB1 accumulates G418, and this indicates that only the GenB1 and GenB2 aminotransferases can catalyze G418 transamination. In the double mutant ΔgenPΔgenB1, G418 was first converted into JI-20B by GenQ and GenB2, and then a small amount of JI-20Ba was generated from JI-20B by the epimerase GenB2. In the double mutant ΔgenPΔgenB2, G418 was converted only into JI-20Ba by GenQ and GenB1. The presence of G418 in ΔgenPΔgenB1 and ΔgenPΔgenB2 cultures can be explained by the deficiency in GenB1 and GenB2 activity, leading to incomplete conversion of G418 into JI-20Ba or JI-20B.

In the single mutant ΔgenB1, small amounts of JI-20Ba and large amounts of JI-20B were converted into C2a and C2, respectively, after 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation. The epimerase GenB2 then performed interconversion between C2a and C2, favoring C2a. Gentamicin C2 was deaminated to produce ZL101 by GenB2. JI-20B was not completely converted into C2 and accumulated in the reaction mixture. In the single mutant ΔgenB2, JI-20Ba produced by GenB1 was converted into C2a after 3′,4′-bisdehydroxylation, and this was then deaminated by GenB1 to afford ZL101.

Although GenB2 is a bifunctional enzyme, it might not catalyze both transamination and epimerization simultaneously in vitro. Figure 3 B and C shows that when the substrate can be deaminated and isomerized by GenB2 (e.g., JI-20B and C2), both reactions occur at the same time; however, when the substrate can only be isomerized by GenB2 (e.g., JI-20Ba and C2a), the enzyme solely displays isomerase activity. The explanation might be that GenB2 participation in the isomerization reaction shifts the dynamic balance, causing conformation changes in the active site responsible for deamination, so this cannot then take place even if JI-20B and C2 are generated.

Our findings differ somewhat from another recent study on GenB1 and GenB2 functions in the gentamicin biosynthetic pathway. ${}^{[11]}$ In the previous study, the results were conflicting. On the one hand, gentamicin C2a formed from JI-20B was found in the double mutant ΔgenB2ΔgenB1, whereas G418 could not be converted into JI-20B by GenB3 and GenB4 in vitro, thus suggesting that an aminotransferase other than GenB1–GenB4 participated in JI-20B generation. On the other hand, the quadruple mutant ΔgenB4ΔgenB1ΔgenB3ΔgenB2 was unable to produce JI-20B, thus suggesting that no other

aminotransferases could catalyze this step. In our study, the ΔgenB2ΔgenB1 mutant accumulated G418 but not JI-20B, thus confirming that in *M. echinospora*, no aminotransferases other than GenB1 and GenB2 could catalyze this step. Although JI-20Ba and JI-20B are epimers and show the same peak in HPLC, we separated the two compounds by changing the mobile phase, to prolong the retention times. GenB1 catalyzed the transamination of JI-20Ba but not JI-20B. JI-20B was generated only when GenB2 was expressed, and GenB2 could also catalyze the epimerization of JI-20Ba and JI-20B. JI-20B is probably another precursor of gentamicin C2.

### Conclusion

This study has described a new parallel branch of the gentamicin C2/C2a biosynthetic pathway starting at G418, and has characterized two aminotransferases—GenB1 and GenB2—with different activity, substrate specificity, and enantioselectivity involved in this pathway. We have also identified JI-20Ba, the epimer of JI-20B, for the first time. G418 is the common precursor of JI-20Ba and JI-20B. JI-20Ba is a precursor for gentamicin C2a biosynthesis, and JI-20B is a precursor for gentamicin C2 biosynthesis. The C6′-amino groups of JI-20Ba and JI-20B are formed by aminotransferases GenB1 and GenB2 respectively. GenB2 is a bifunctional enzyme, also possessing epimerase activity, and catalyzes the epimerization of JI-20Ba/JI-20B and C2a/C2.

### Experimental Section

#### Bacterial strains and culture conditions: 
Bacterial strains used in the study are listed in Table S2. Wild-type and mutant *M. echinospora* ATCC15835 strains were maintained on solid slanting medium (SSM): soluble starch (1%), MgSO₄·7H₂O (0.05%), KNO₃ (0.1%), NaCl (0.05%), asparagine (0.002%), CaCO₃ (0.1%), wheat bran (1.0%), K₂HPO₄·3H₂O (0.03%), agar (1.5%), pH 7.5 at 37 °C. To isolate genomic DNA, the strains were cultivated in ATCC172 liquid medium for three days. *Escherichia coli* strains were cultured at 37 °C in lysogeny broth (LB) liquid or agar medium supplemented with apramycin (50 μg mL⁻¹), ampicillin (100 μg mL⁻¹), erythromycin (100 μg mL⁻¹), chloramphenicol (25 μg mL⁻¹), or kanamycin (25 μg mL⁻¹), as required. *E. coli* DH5α served as the host for molecular cloning. Intergeneric conjugal transfer on MS agar was conducted with *E. coli* ET 12567 (pUZ8002) as the donor, and 2×YT medium was used for conjugation.

Gentamicin was produced by *M. echinospora* strains by a two-stage fermentation. The seed culture was maintained in a 250 mL flask containing seed medium (30 mL): soluble starch (1.0%), soybean powder (1.5%), glucose (0.1%), KNO₃ (0.05%), CaCO₃ (0.3%), pH 6.8 at 34 °C, 220 rpm, for 36 h. The culture was diluted 1:10 (v/v) in fermentation medium (30 mL): soluble starch (5.0%), soy bean powder (3.5%), (NH₄)₂SO₄ (0.05%), peptone (0.2%), glucose (1.5%), KNO₃ (0.05%), CaCO₃ (0.6%), CoCl₂·6H₂O (0.001%), corn starch (1.5 %), pH 7.5 and incubated in a 250 mL flask at 34 °C, 220 rpm, for five days.

#### Construction of gene disruption plasmids:
Primers and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table S1. The pD2925ΔgenB1plasmid containing *genB1* with in-frame deletion was constructed as follows: B11 and B12 fragments were amplified by PCR from WT
chromosomal DNA by use of primer pairs P11/P12 and P13/P14, respectively, and sequentially cloned into the pIJ2925 plasmid; the B11–B12 fragment was then inserted into the suicide shuttle vector pD2925. The pKC1139ΔgenB2 vector containing *genB2* with in-frame deletion was constructed by inserting two *genB2*-flanking DNA fragments into the pKC1139 temperature-sensitive shuttle vector. B21 and B22 fragments were amplified by PCR with use of primer pairs P21/P22 and P23/P24 and sequentially cloned into the pKC1139 plasmid. The pKC1139ΔgenP vector containing *genP* with in-frame deletion was constructed as follows: I1 and I2 fragments were amplified by use of primer pairs P1/P2 and P3/P4, respectively, and sequentially cloned into the pIJ2925 vector; the I1–I2 fragment was then inserted into the pKC1139 plasmid. All plasmids were verified by sequencing.

Construction of gene deletion mutants: *E. coli* ET12567 (pUZ8002) was transformed with the pD2925ΔgenB1, pKC1139ΔgenB2, and pKC1139ΔgenP plasmids. The disruption plasmids were introduced into *M. echinospora* through conjugal transfer from *E. coli* on MS agar at 28 °C for 24 h, as described previously.[25] After overlaying of agar with apramycin (50 μg mL⁻¹) and pipemidic acid (PPA, 50 μg mL⁻¹), incubation was continued for eight days at 28 °C. Single-crossover recombinant colonies were first selected for apramycin resistance and were then cultivated on SSM plates without antibiotic at 37 °C. The apramycin-sensitive strains were confirmed by PCR with appropriate primers (Figure S14) and by sequencing.

The disruption plasmid pD2925ΔgenB1 was introduced into the ΔgenB2 and ΔgenP strains through conjugal transfer to obtain double mutants ΔgenB2ΔgenB1 and ΔgenPΔgenB1. The disruption plasmid pKC1139ΔgenB2 was introduced into the ΔgenP strain through conjugal transfer to obtain the double mutant ΔgenPΔgenB2. The genomic DNA of the double mutants was analyzed by PCR with use of two primer pairs (Figure S14).

Complementation of single mutants: The pSPU241 and pEAP1 plasmids were used to construct gene complementation vectors. The *genB1*, *genB2*, and *genP* genes were amplified from WT chromosomal DNA by use of primer pairs CB1–1/exB1–2, CB2–1/exB2–2, and CP-1/CP-2, respectively, and PCR products were inserted into the BamHI and HindIII sites of pSPU241. The cloned genes containing the *PermE* promoter and *To* terminator were digested with BglII and inserted into pEAP1 to generate pEAPB1, pEAPB2, and pEAPP. The complementation plasmids were verified by sequencing and then introduced individually into ΔgenB1, ΔgenB2, ΔgenP by conjugation. The plasmids were integrated into *M. echinospora* chromosomal DNA by site-specific recombination. Complemented exconjugants were identified by erythromycin resistance and confirmed by PCR (Figure S15).

Extraction, purification, separation, and analysis of metabolites from *M. echinospora* strains: Fermentation cultures were adjusted to pH 2.0 with H₂SO₄ (2 M) and agitated for 30 min. After centrifugation at 1600 g for 10 min at 4 °C, the supernatant was neutralized with NaOH (2 M). Antibiotics were isolated from the fermentation broth by ion-exchange chromatography with 732NH₄⁺ ion-exchange resin. The anion-exchange column was washed with double-distilled (dd) H₂O until the effluent was colorless, and bound antibiotics were then sequentially eluted with eight column volumes of HCl (0.4 M), NH₄Cl (0.4 M), a mixture of HCl (0.2 M) and NH₄Cl (0.62 M), and again with ddH₂O. The eluates were then passed through 711H⁺ ion-exchange resin for discoloration, and antibiotics were eluted with six column volumes of NH₄Cl (5%). The fractions with the activity against *B. subtilis* were concentrated

by reduced pressure distillation, lyophilized, resuspended in ddH₂O, filtered through a 0.22 μm filter, and analyzed by HPLC performed with an Ultimate LP-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm; Welch Materials, Inc., Maryland, USA) connected to an evaporative light scattering detector. The mobile phase was trifluoroacetic acid (0.2 M)/methanol (92:8 or 98:2, v/v) used at a flow rate of 0.6 mL min⁻¹. Production yields for all strains were calculated with the aid of an external standard. The contents of the components were determined by area normalization with gentamicin C1a as the standard. Separation of the components was performed by dissolving lyophilized gentamicin samples in ddH₂O and loading them onto a D152 NH₄⁺ ion-exchange column; elution with 0.01–2 M gradient NH₄Cl was monitored by assaying the eluted fractions for anti-*B. subtilis* activity. Fractions containing single components were combined, concentrated by reduced pressure distillation, lyophilized, and analyzed by MS and NMR.

NMR analysis: All experiments were performed with a Bruker Avance 600 MHz NMR spectrometer operating at 600.13 MHz (¹H) and 150.90 MHz (¹³C) and equipped with the XWIN-NMR software, version 3.0 (Bruker Analytik, Rheinstetten, Germany). For ¹H, ¹³C, ¹H,¹H COSY, HSQC, and NOESY NMR analyses, Jl-20Ba (20 mg) or Jl-20B (20 mg) was dissolved in D₂O (500 μL); for ¹H NMR analysis, ZL101 (5 mg) was dissolved in D₂O (500 μL).

Biotransformation experiments: The ΔgenK mutant was cultured in fermentation medium for 96 h, intermediates of the gentamicin pathway were then added at the final concentration of 1 mg mL⁻¹, and the culture was further incubated for 144 h at 34 °C. Each experiment was repeated three times. Product extraction, purification, and analysis were performed as described above.

Cloning, overexpression, and purification of GenQ, GenB1, and GenB2: The *genB1*, *genB2*, and *genQ* genes were amplified from chromosomal DNA of the WT strain by PCR with use of primer pairs exB1–1/exB1–2, exB2–1/exB2–2, and exQ-1/exQ-2, respectively. PCR products inserted into the Ncol and HindIII sites of the pET32a (+) vector were verified by nucleotide sequencing, and the recombinant and empty plasmids were used to transform *E. coli* BL21 (DE3). The recombinant strain BL21-pET32a was used for blank control.

Transformed bacteria were cultured at 37 °C in LB liquid medium supplemented with ampicillin (100 μg mL⁻¹) until the optical density at 600 nm was 0.4–0.6. Protein expression was induced with IPTG (0.2 mM) at 28 °C for 6 h. The bacteria were harvested by centrifugation, resuspended in binding buffer [20 mL, Tris-HCl (20 mM), NaCl (0.5 M), imidazole (5 mM), pH 8.0], and disrupted by sonication for 10 min with use of a 3 s-on/5 s-off cycle. After centrifugation at 15480 g at 4 °C for 10 min, the supernatant was loaded into Ni-Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (GE Healthcare), the column was washed with washing buffer [Tris-HCl (20 mM), NaCl (0.5 M), imidazole (10–50 mM), pH 8.0], and His-tagged recombinant proteins were eluted with elution buffer [Tris-HCl (20 mM), NaCl (0.5 M), imidazole (200 mM), pH 8.0].

The purified enzymes were concentrated and dialyzed against Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 20 mM) containing KCl (50 mM) and glycerol (10%) and stored at –20 °C. Purified proteins demonstrated single bands in SDS-PAGE gels, and these were in agreement with the calculated molecular weight (MWs) of 63.5, 63.2, and 73.4 kDa (Figure S11). The blank control strain did not produce target proteins.

Enzymatic assays: The GenQ/GenB1 and GenQ/GenB2 coupled assay was performed in Tris-HCl (pH 8.0, 20 mM) containing purified GenQ (30–50 μg), GenB1 (30–50 μg) or GenB2 (30–50 μg),

G418 (0.4 mM), L-glutamate (2 mM) as a donor amino acid, FAD (0.8 mM), and PLP (0.4 mM) at 37°C overnight.

GenB1 and GenB2 deamination was performed in Tris·HCl (pH 8.0, 20 mM) containing gentamicins C2 (0.4 mM) and C2a (0.4 mM), JI-20Ba (0.4 mM) or JI-20B (0.4 mM), purified GenB1 (30–50 μg) or GenB2 (30–50 μg), PLP (0.4 mM), and α-ketoglutarate (2 mM), pyruvic acid (2 mM), or oxaloacetic acid (2 mM) as amino group acceptors, at 37°C overnight.

The epimerization assay was performed in Tris·HCl (pH 8.0, 20 mM) containing gentamicins C2 (0.4 mM) and C2a (0.4 mM), JI-20Ba (0.4 mM) or JI-20B (0.4 mM), purified GenB1 (30–50 μg) or GenB2 (30–50 μg), and PLP (0.4 mM), at 37°C overnight.

In all assays, chloroform was added to the reaction mixtures to quench enzymatic reactions followed by centrifugation. The supernatants were analyzed by HPLC.
