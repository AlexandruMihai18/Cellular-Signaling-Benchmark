Tight junctions: from simple barriers to multifunctional molecular gates

Ceniz Zihni, Clare Mills, Karl Matter and Maria S. Balda

Abstract | Epithelia and endothelia separate different tissue compartments and protect multicellular organisms from the outside world. This requires the formation of tight junctions, selective gates that control paracellular diffusion of ions and solutes. Tight junctions also form the border between the apical and basolateral plasma-membrane domains and are linked to the machinery that controls apicobasal polarization. Additionally, signalling networks that guide diverse cell behaviours and functions are connected to tight junctions, transmitting information to and from the cytoskeleton, nucleus and different cell adhesion complexes. Recent advances have broadened our understanding of the molecular architecture and cellular functions of tight junctions.

Desmosomes  
Adhesive structures, also known as maculae adhaerentes, formed from dense protein plaques of two adjacent cells, with associated intermediate filaments and transmembrane proteins, which belong to cadherin family.

Microscopists in the nineteenth century described the paracellular space between neighbouring cells in an epithelial sheet to be sealed by a ‘terminal bar’. This structure was later resolved by electron microscopy into a composite of distinct cell–cell junctions that is now called the epithelial junctional complex, which is formed by tight junctions, adherens junctions and desmosomes^{1,2}. Because tight junctions and adherens junctions are more tightly associated and often reside at the apical end of the lateral membrane, they are often referred to as the apical junctional complex (however, in endothelia, tight junctions and adherens junctions can be intercalated) (FIG. 1a).

Tight junctions are essential for establishing a barrier between different compartments of the body, and their primary physiological role is to function as paracellular gates that restrict diffusion on the basis of size and charge. Selective paracellular diffusion is an essential process for the maintenance of homoeostasis in organs and tissues. Tight junctions have long been the most enigmatic of all adhesion complexes and have eluded detailed molecular and functional analysis owing to their complex architecture. Recent years have witnessed the identification of a large array of components that are associated with tight junctions, implicating these junctions in an unexpected range of different functions; this has challenged the traditional model, in which tight junctions are considered to be simple diffusion barriers formed by a rigid molecular complex. In line with these various functions, mutations in genes encoding tight junction proteins have been linked to a range of inherited human diseases. Additionally, tight junction components are known to be targeted by various pathogenic bacteria and viruses, which hijack tight junction proteins to enter and infect cells, or target junctional signalling mechanisms to cross tissue barriers (BOX 1). Although tight junctions are a vertebrate-specific type of junction, many of their components and functions are evolutionarily conserved (BOX 2).

The main purpose of this Review is to examine recent discoveries about the molecular architecture of tight junctions and their functions. We discuss exciting insights into how tight junctions function as signalling platforms that guide cell behaviour and differentiation, as well as their role in cell polarization. We also survey recent results suggesting unexpected crosstalk between tight junctions and other adhesive structures.

Structure and composition  
Electron microscopy has revealed that tight junctions form close focal contacts between plasma membranes of neighbouring cells. Depending on the preservation method used, these contacts may appear as hemi-fusions or ‘kisses’ (that is, close approximations of the neighbouring plasma membranes with apparent continuity of the exoplasmic leaflets)^{2} (FIG. 1). Freeze fracture electron microscopy, a technique that enables the imaging of the hydrophobic interior of a membrane, reveals tight junctions as a meshwork of fibrils that are apparently formed by rows of transmembrane particles and are thought to represent the diffusion barriers^{3,4} (FIG. 2). Tight junctions also contain an electron-dense junctional plaque that consists of cytosolic proteins that form the interface between the junctional membrane and the cytoskeleton.

MARVEL domain  
A four-transmembrane helix  
module that has been  
identified in proteins of various  
families, many of which  
are associated with cholesterol-rich  
membrane microdomains.

**Transmembrane proteins.** The main protein components of the transmembrane strands observed by freeze fracture electron microscopy are tetraspan proteins of the claudin family (encompassing 26 members in humans and 27 in mice, see below) and the three junctional MARVEL domain proteins: occludin, tricellulin (also known as MARVEL domain-containing protein 2 (MARVELD2)) and MARVELD3 (FIG. 1b). These proteins have been localized by immunoelectron microscopy to the strands; if expressed in cells that do not form tight junctions, they have been shown to induce superficially similar strands in the case of claudins or transmembrane particles, and short strand fragments in the case of occludin<sup>5-8</sup>, although these findings have not been confirmed for all members of the two families. Similarly, some claudins and occludin are able to mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent cell–cell adhesion, further supporting a model in which tight junctions consist of multimeric transmembrane-protein complexes that mediate cell–cell adhesion<sup>8,9</sup>.

Box 1 | Tight junctions and molecular links to human disease

Tight junctions have been linked to diseases that affect many tissues and organs. Some of these diseases are inherited and involve mutations or polymorphisms in tight junction-associated proteins themselves or lead to activation of tight junction-associated signalling mechanisms, as in the case of cystic fibrosis (see the table, left). Similarly, multiple pathogenic viruses and bacteria are known to target tight junctions (see the table, right). Usually, this involves direct interactions with junctional proteins but, as in the case of Helicobacter pylori, may involve activation of a cellular signalling protein (in this case partitioning defective 1 (PAR1)) that is not associated with tight junctions but stimulates a junctional signalling pathway. Many other diseases, such as chronic inflammatory conditions and cancer, have been linked to dysfunction of tight junctions, but it is generally not known whether tight-junction deregulation is a cause or a consequence of disease. For more details, see REFS 43,85.

Other transmembrane components of tight junctions include a trispan protein, blood vessel epicardial substance (BVES), and a large group of single-span transmembrane adhesion proteins with two immunoglobulin-like domains that comprises junctional adhesion molecules (JAMs), coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) and angulins (also known as lipolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptors) ${}^{10-15}$. In epithelia and endothelia, most junctions are formed between two neighbouring cells (bicellular junctions). However, at corners where three cells meet, tricellular junctions are formed. These tricellular corners are thought to require a more complex junctional architecture, which is reflected in components such as angulins and tricellulin that are enriched at these tricellular junctions. These components are thought to mediate functional integrity of the junction in epithelial and endothelial cells. Additionally, crumbs homologue 3 (CRB3), a protein with epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like domains that is important for apical polarization, associates with tight junctions ${}^{16,17}$. These proteins have not been shown to associate with the transmembrane strands, but their removal or overexpression can modulate the strength of the junctional barrier, or, in a similar way to JAM proteins, they can regulate junction assembly (see below). Many of the functions of transmembrane tight junction proteins depend on interactions with components of the complex cytosolic plaque that underlies the junctional membrane.

**Junctional plaque components.** The cytosolic plaque is a complex protein network that interacts with the cytoplasmic domains of junctional membrane proteins as well as with F-actin and microtubules (FIG. 1b). Its main structural components are adaptor proteins that contain multiple protein–protein interaction motifs ${}^{18}$. A typical example is the first tight junction protein to be identified, zonula occludens 1 (ZO1). This 220 kDa peripheral membrane protein consists of an amino-terminal half with three PSD95, DlgA, ZO1 homology (PDZ) domains, an SRC homology 3 (SH3) domain and a yeast guanylate kinase homology (GUK) domain, and a carboxy-terminal half that interacts with F-actin and contains alternatively spliced domains that may confer tissue-specific functions ${}^{19-21}$. The N-terminal domains

of ZO1 bind to different transmembrane proteins: claudins bind to the first PDZ domain, JAMs bind to the third PDZ domain and occludin binds to the GUK domain. The SH3 domain links ZO1 to junctional signalling mechanisms by binding to ZO1-associated nucleic acid binding protein (ZONAB) (see below), a transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression, and a heat shock protein, APG2 (also known as HSP70RY)^{20,22–25}. ZO1 proteins also engage in intramolecular interactions that lead to the acquisition of a closed conformation in which access to the central GUK–SH3 module is limited^{26,27}. This feature may underlie the inability of *in vitro*-translated full-length ZO1 to bind SH3 domain ligands, which can

be bound by polypeptides expressed from constructs encoding only parts of the ZO1 sequence^{28}. Although the functional relevance of such intramolecular interactions is poorly understood, they might serve as regulatory switches for ligand binding and, thereby, junction formation and signalling.

The tight junction plaque contains a vast number of other adaptor proteins, many of which interact with each other, forming a protein network. Examples include ZO2 and ZO3, two proteins that co-immunoprecipitate with ZO1 (REFS 29–31). They have the same domain structure as ZO1 in the N-terminal half but have unique C-terminal parts. ZO1 and ZO2 interact with ZO1 in a mutually exclusive manner through the second PDZ domain. Other examples of junctional plaque proteins are the membrane-associated guanylate kinase inverted (MAGI) proteins (which have the same type of domains as the ZO proteins but in an inverted arrangement), or the multi-PDZ domain proteins MUPP1 (also known as MPDZ) and PALS1-associated tight junction (PATJ; also known as INADL) protein^{16,32–36}. Another type of junctional adaptor is represented by cingulin and junction-associated coiled-coil protein (JACOP; also known as paracingulin and cingulin-like protein 1), two homologous coiled-coil proteins that bind to various junctional proteins, including F-actin and, in the case of cingulin, microtubules^{37,38}.

There is evidence that the cytoplasmic plaque might be an ordered structure with proteins such as cingulin being farther from the membrane than core proteins like ZO1 (REF. 39) (FIG. 1c). Although adaptor proteins may have a distinct overall distribution in the junction, their distributions also overlap, and they are able to interact with each other and form complexes^{40}. In addition, the junction contains many different signalling proteins that are recruited by binding to adaptors or to membrane proteins (for example, occludin and MARVELD3)^{41,42}. These signalling proteins include protein kinases, phosphatases, monomeric and trimeric GTP-binding proteins and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulators, which participate in various signalling pathways^{43–45} (TABLE 1).

Given that many junctional proteins belong to the same protein family or have similar protein-binding motifs, it is intriguing that so many proteins localize to tight junctions. The varying functional properties of the many claudins provide a reason why so many of these transmembrane proteins are recruited, but it is more difficult to understand why so many adaptor proteins are required. Knockouts and knockdowns of single adaptor proteins (for example, cingulin or ZO3) in cells in culture and in whole organisms have often yielded only minimal functional consequences^{46,47}. Hence, many junctional proteins are considered to have redundant functions. However, this does not seem to be the case for ZO1 and ZO2: individual knockouts of both adaptors are embryonic lethal^{48,49}. *In vitro*, Madin–Darby canine kidney epithelial (MDCK) cells have generally been shown to lack a clear loss-of-function phenotype in monolayers when subject to ZO1 RNA interference; however, this was later attributed to incomplete depletion of ZO1 transcripts. This was further substantiated by the observation that

**Box 2 | Evolutionary conservation of tight junction functions**

Tight junctions and their homologous structures in invertebrates, collectively called occluding junctions, show a higher degree of variation in metazoans than do cadherin-based junctions. In vertebrates, tight junctions are located apical to adherens junctions, whereas in invertebrates the most apical junctional structures are commonly adherens junctions (see the figure). Although tight junction structures exist in some lower invertebrates and chordates, the equivalent structure in many invertebrate epithelia (for example, in insects such as *Drosophila melanogaster*) is located basal to the adherens junction, and is known as the septate junction. Alternatively, the diffusion barrier may be integrated into adherens junctions, as is the case in *Caenorhabditis elegans*^{171,172}. Notably, the septate junction in *D. melanogaster* contains claudin-like molecules that are important for barrier function^{173–177}. *C. elegans* also has claudin-like molecules, and at least two of them are important for barrier formation (however, as noted above, they are associated with adherens junctions, which have different subdomains, such as the zone enriched in the apical junction molecule 1 (AJM1)–discs large homologue 1 (DLG1) complex)^{178}. Thus, whereas the importance of claudins for barrier formation is conserved, the junction they associate with is not.

Another striking example of evolutionary conservation is the machinery associated with apical polarization. The signalling mechanisms that regulate apical polarization include two protein complexes formed by apical determinants: the partitioning defective 3 (PAR3)–PAR6–atypical protein kinase C (aPKC)–CDC42 complex and the protein crumbs homologue 3 (CRB3)–protein associated with Lin-7 1 (PALS1)–PALS1-associated tight junction (PATJ) complex. Both complexes have been reported to associate with tight junctions in vertebrates and have homologues in *C. elegans* and in *D. melanogaster*, in which they associate with the subapical region (SAR; also known as apical marginal zone)^{179}. The evolutionary conservation may even extend further: a SAR-like signalling zone enriched in aPKC, CRB3, ezrin and the CDC42 activator DBL3 is also associated with the apical end of tight junctions in vertebrates^{125}.

Different junctional functions are thus associated with different types of junction in different phyla, suggesting that intercellular junctions have become reconfigured during evolution but that individual proteins and their functions, as well as general junctional functions, are conserved. This conservation is also reflected in the molecular remodelling that occurs during junction assembly in vertebrates, in which an initial primordial adhesive complex first contains components of both tight junctions and adherens junctions, and only later matures into distinct junctional complexes^{180}.

low-level re-expression of ZO1 in knockout cells could rescue the phenotype associated with complete ZO1 removal<sup>50</sup>. Nevertheless, adaptive processes in the junctional protein network in response to removal of individual components do occur. For example, deletion of ZO3 in mice leads to increased junctional recruitment of ZO2 (REF. 46). Such adaptive processes render junctions biologically more robust, but they make experimental analysis more difficult because, for example, constitutive depletion methods in cell lines may lead to adaptive processes during cell-line selection. The apparent redundancy under standard experimental conditions may also mean that a protein is only important under certain conditions or in specific cell types and/or model systems, as exemplified by the importance of ZO3 for osmoregulation in zebrafish or occludin for barrier maintenance in ethanol-stressed mice<sup>51,52</sup>. Hence, understanding the functional role of specific tight junction proteins and how they cooperate to form functional junctional complexes will require a more detailed analysis of specific tissues and processes in different experimental models, conditional gene-inactivation approaches, overexpression experiments and analysis of how junctional complexes adapt to the removal of specific components.

### Models of tight junction structure

The ultrastructural appearance of tight junctions has fuelled the discussion about their molecular architecture for decades. Two models have emerged as a result of this discussion: a protein model and a protein–lipid hybrid model. The protein–lipid hybrid model is often referred to as the lipid model, although the need for proteins has always been accepted (FIG. 2a). The protein model posits that the paracellular diffusion barrier is formed by transmembrane proteins that form an intercellular protein complex between the two neighbouring plasma membranes that have a standard bilayer lipid configuration. This model has recently gained more support owing to the identification of the claudin crystal structure and subsequent modelling approaches that enabled the construction of a structural model that provides a good fit to the junctional ultrastructure. The 2.4 Å resolution structure of claudin 15 revealed a characteristic β-sheet fold formed by the two extracellular domains, which are anchored to a transmembrane four-helix bundle<sup>53</sup> (FIG. 3a). Claudin 15 forms a linear polymer mediated by specific interactions between adjacent extracellular domains, which are required for reconstituting tight junction-like intramembrane strands. Cys crosslinking then led to a model in which two such antiparallel strands associate with each other to form an intramembrane tight junction strand<sup>54</sup>. Consequently, each membrane–membrane contact site consists of four claudin polymers, two per cell, that interact through their extracellular domains, forming the junctional barrier and permeation pathway (FIG. 3b). As different claudins may polymerize in the same strand or in adjacent strands in a heterotypic or homotypic fashion, tight junction strands form a mosaic consisting of various claudin molecules<sup>55–57</sup>. Although this model provides a possible structural explanation for how claudins form linear strands, it is more difficult to see how other junctional membrane proteins that associate with strands and that have different dynamic properties (for example, occludin) fit into this model<sup>58</sup>. Similarly, electron micrographs indicate that native junctional intramembrane strands are not linear but interconnect, leading to the formation of networks (FIG. 1e). Hence, a molecular model for strand formation requires a mechanism for branching, which is currently not supported by the claudin-based protein model.

The hybrid model offers possible answers to some of these questions. It proposes that the close membrane–membrane contact sites are actual membrane hemifusions and that the intramembrane strands are in fact cylinders of inverted lipid micelles. In this case, the lamellar structure of the membrane lipid bilayer forms a hexagonal transitory arrangement whereby lipid chains are oriented outwards<sup>59,60</sup> (FIG. 2a). This model is based on the demonstration that protein-free liposomes can form tight junction-like strands<sup>61</sup>. A hemifusion state is energetically unfavourable; hence, transmembrane proteins were proposed to stabilize the inverted micellar structure<sup>59</sup>. This hybrid model is supported by the observation that native tight junction strands seem to contain both proteins and phospholipids<sup>62,63</sup>. According to this model, lipids are filling the gaps between different types of membrane proteins, eliminating the need for proteins to form continuous polymers<sup>58,64</sup>. Consequently, this model can explain why different protein components that have different dynamic properties can be a part of the same strands.

Different experiments have been performed to differentiate between the two models, but a consensus has so far not been reached. Cell-to-cell lipid diffusion experiments should provide an answer because lipids can only diffuse from one cell to another if the exoplasmic leaflets of two neighbouring cells are continuous, as in the hybrid model. Such experiments have already been performed but have so far proved to be inconclusive; they have shown that lipids with large polar heads do not diffuse, whereas smaller, fluorescently labelled lipids with modified acyl chains do<sup>65,66</sup>. It is thus possible that alternative barriers (such as negative membrane curvature) prevent the diffusion of lipids with large head domains or that the modified smaller lipids can exchange between closely apposed membranes without the need for the formation of hemifusions.

Regardless of the model, there is no doubt that lipids are important for tight junctions and their functions. For example, it has been shown that some tight junction proteins are associated with cholesterol-rich, detergent-resistant membrane microdomains, and that reduction of the membrane cholesterol content can modify epithelial barrier properties<sup>67–69</sup>. It is possible that cholesterol might affect the membrane itself by influencing the lipid structure, or its presence might influence functional properties of transmembrane proteins by altering their lipid environment<sup>70,71</sup>. One could also imagine that the strands are not as homogeneous as generally assumed and might be composed of sections containing different lipid structures and protein compositions; hence, the junction may not be formed by a single architectural principle.

**Osmoregulation**

A process used by cells and simple organisms to maintain fluid and electrolyte balance with their immediate environment.

**Lipid micelles**

Lipid molecules arranged in a spherical form in aqueous solutions as a result of the amphipathic nature of fatty acids, meaning that they contain a hydrophilic, polar head group and a long hydrophobic chain.
The true structure of tight junctions thus remains to be established. Because intramembrane strands can thus far only be seen in fixed specimens, new methods will have to be developed that enable the visualization of strand dynamics. Hopefully, improvements in live imaging approaches combined with enhancements in the resolution of light microscopy may provide the answer to these questions. However, despite the lack of consensus regarding tight junction structure, the current models and structural data allow us to gain a better understanding of how tight junctions function as permeability barriers.

Barrier functions
Tight junctions form two types of barrier. The paracellular barrier regulates selective paracellular permeability: that is, the passive transport of molecules across the tissue and between distinct compartments of the body. The intramembrane barrier restricts the exchange of membrane components between the apical and basolateral cell surface domains ('fence' function) (FIG. 2b). The two barriers have the same physical location at intramembrane strands and are likely to be structurally related.

Regulation of paracellular permeability. The physiological properties of the junctional gate are that of a semipermeable diffusion barrier that discriminates solutes on the basis of size and charge72. Solutes can cross the junctional paracellular pathway along two routes. The charge-selective permeation pathway is thought to consist of pores across serially arranged barriers allowing diffusion of ions and small uncharged molecules (FIG. 2c). The estimated diameter of these pores is ~4–8 Å and depends on the tissue and molecule analysed73–75. A second diffusion pathway, the size-selective pathway, allows the diffusion of larger solutes, macromolecules up to a size limit of ~30–60 Å72,75. Charge-selective ion permeation and size-selective macromolecular diffusion occur by different mechanisms and can be regulated in opposing manners76. Ion permeation is typically experimentally measured by assessing electrical resistance or conductivity, an instantaneous measurement that requires a continuous conductive pathway for a current to flow. Macromolecular diffusion is slow, requiring

tracer diffusion measurements over longer periods of time (in the timeframe of hours), and hence it has been suggested that it may occur in a stepwise manner (FIG. 2d). To explain charge-selective permeation, a model of the junction has evolved that considers the intramembrane strands to contain regulated ion-selective channels that can open and close. To account for macromolecular permeation, a dynamic strand model has been introduced in which the intramembrane strands remodel, allowing slow diffusion (FIG. 2d). Such serial diffusion barriers might be formed by protein polymers (according to the protein model) or by inverted lipid cylinders whose stability is regulated by associated proteins (according to the hybrid model)76. In this model, the size-selectivity would be determined by the distance between the outer leaflets of the two adhering plasma membranes. In another model, alternative to the dynamic strand model, tight junctions are proposed to be formed by two differently sized inverted micelles, and macromolecular diffusion is suggested to occur inside the larger micelles, which dynamically form and dissolve to allow the transport of molecules75. However, current freeze fracture data do not suggest that junctions contain two different sizes of intramembrane strands.

Although significant progress has been made in the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms that enable junctional ion permeability, macromolecular diffusion is still not well understood: the currently available insights have been summarized in other reviews75,76. Hence, we focus here on recent exciting findings that have helped to decipher the molecular mechanisms underlying junctional ion permeation.

On their discovery, claudins quickly emerged as candidates for mediating ion-selective paracellular diffusion because one of them, claudin 16 (also known as paracellin 1), was identified as a gene that is mutated in renal magnesium wasting, an inherited disease that affects renal paracellular magnesium reabsorption77 (BOX 1). The tissue-specific expression pattern of claudins further fuelled the hypothesis that the claudin composition of a tight junction determines its permeability properties. Claudins are now grouped according to their channel- and barrier-forming properties into those that support cation-selectivity (for example, claudin 2, claudin 10b and claudin 15), anion-selectivity (for example, claudin 10a and claudin 17) or sealing (for example, claudin 1)73,78–85. The sealing group includes claudins that have not (yet) been associated with promoting the permeability of a specific type of ion or molecule, and are hence thought to restrict transport and enhance the barrier function. However, it is also possible that they form pores for yet to be identified molecules.

Expression studies combined with measurements of the permeability of epithelial-cell monolayers have shown that claudins are important determinants of the properties of the paracellular ion barrier. The first evidence for channel formation by claudins came from structural and functional studies demonstrating that modification of the first extracellular loop of claudins affects the conductive properties of claudin-transfected cells85,86. For example, the cation-selective claudin 2

Figure 2 | Models of the structure and function of tight junctions. a | Models of tight junction structure. The protein model proposes that intercellular protein–protein interactions are involved in the formation of a paracellular diffusion barrier between two plasma membranes, which are formed by standard lipid bilayers. According to the protein–lipid hybrid model, the continuity of the lipid bilayer is interrupted by cylinder-shaped inverted micelles, which are stabilized by transmembrane proteins, and this creates areas of hemifusions of the two neighbouring plasma membranes. In such a model, the exoplasmic leaflets of neighbouring cells are continuous. b | The fence and gate functions of tight junctions. Integral transmembrane-protein components can act as a fence for the diffusion of lipids along the exoplasmic leaflet (arrows); in a hybrid model, the contact site would also contain inverted micelles, resulting in discontinuity of the apical and lateral exoplasmic leaflets. Also indicated is the gate function, which refers to a regulated, semipermeable barrier that controls diffusion along the paracellular space. c,d | Specificity of the paracellular gate and mechanisms of diffusion. The paracellular diffusion barrier is semipermeable and differentiates between different solutes on the basis of size and charge. Size-selective macromolecular diffusion of tracers (green particles indicate hydrophilic molecules that can diffuse across the junction; red particles indicate molecules that are too large to cross tight junctions) and ion conductance are thought to be mediated by two distinct mechanisms. Ion conductance is mediated by gated channels that can be opened (yellow channels) or closed (grey channels) and are ion selective. These channels are thought to be formed by intercellular claudin complexes creating pore-like structures (FIG. 3). Size-selective macromolecular tracer diffusion is less well understood but may involve dynamic properties of the intramembrane strands, such as remodelling of the branches or even dissociation and reformation of strand sections, leading to transient openings of the paracellular space to allow the stepwise diffusion across the junction (depicted in part d, which represents a schematic en face view of a section through tight junctions along the contacts between two neighbouring cells). The indicated serial diffusion barriers, which sequentially open and close, are thought to be the intramembrane strands seen in freeze fracture replicas.

domains are of a length that is consistent with the lipid bilayer thickness, and they contain residues with small side chains that are important for tight helical packing. Mutations leading to changes in such residues are associated with human disease, suggesting that they are indeed functionally important ${ }^{77,92}$. Similarly, mutation of the two conserved Cys residues in the first extracellular loop abolishes the barrier-forming ability of claudin 5, suggesting that the disulfide bond formed between these Cys residues is important, and there is evidence suggesting that it stabilizes the $\beta$-sheet structure ${ }^{93}$. Head-to-head association of two antiparallel claudin strands from one cell with two strands from the neighbouring cell is thought to lead to the formation of a $\beta$-barrel that defines the paracellular pore ${ }^{54}$ (FIG. 3b,c). Even though the packing density generated by such a structure has been debated ${ }^{94}$, the $\beta$-barrel model is compatible with structure–function studies. For example, the negatively charged residues Glu55 and Asp64 of claudin 15 extend away from the $\beta$-sheet surface, leading to a negatively charged $\beta$-barrel, which would be compatible with a cation-selective pore. Previous work indeed demonstrated that substituting these two residues with positively charged ones alters the ion-selectivity of this claudin ${ }^{86}$. Similarly, homology models indicate that cation-selective claudin 2 and anion-selective claudin 10a form negatively and positively charged barrel surfaces, respectively ${ }^{53}$. Altogether, this $\beta$-barrel model provides an excellent base for future work to elucidate the structural basis for junctional ion permeation.

Patch clamp experiments indicate that the junctional pores are gated (FIG. 3c), but the structural basis for opening and closing has not been analysed ${ }^{89}$. Similarly, the gating mechanisms and signals are yet to be identified. An interesting paradigm is provided by lysine-deficient protein kinase 1 (WNK1) and WNK4, two kinases that are linked to pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (BOX 1), which is an autosomal-dominant disorder that leads to hypertension. WNK4 localizes to tight junctions, and the expression of disease-causing alleles of the two kinases stimulates phosphorylation of multiple claudins and leads to increased chloride permeability ${ }^{95-99}$. However, although these studies indicate that claudin-mediated ion conductance is regulated, the structural changes that lead from the phosphorylation of claudins to the opening of claudin-based pores remain to be determined.

typically affect intramembrane diffusion. For example, transient ATP depletion in MDCK cells has no effect on the fence function and the suprastructure of tight junctions but, for unknown reasons, leads to disruption of the paracellular diffusion barrier ${ }^{102}$. By contrast, treatment of epithelial cells with a rotavirus-derived peptide leads to a partial disruption of the continuous intramembrane strand network and increased lipid diffusion between apical and basolateral plasma membrane domains ${ }^{103}$. In the protein model, the transmembrane proteins forming the strands serve to restrict intramembrane diffusion. Conversely, in the hybrid model, apical and basolateral membrane leaflets are discontinuous, inherently generating an exoplasmic fence. However, one would also expect transmembrane proteins to play a part in establishing a fence in the hybrid model as well, because the formation of the unconventional lipid structures according to this model, as discussed above, would require stabilization (FIG. 2a). Expression of an occludin mutant that has inactivated cytosolic domains and is unable to interact with the cytoplasmic plaque indeed disrupts the lipid diffusion barrier ${ }^{104}$. It does so without disrupting the network of intramembrane strands, arguing against a model in which the strands act as the diffusion fence. Because this mutant form of occludin also causes an increase in macromolecular paracellular diffusion, it is possible that the fence function and the mechanism enabling macromolecular diffusion are related. According to the dynamic strand model, introduced above, intramembrane strands remodel themselves to allow macromolecular diffusion (FIG. 2d). If the strands were responsible for the fence function as well, increased strand dynamics would indeed lead to increased intramembrane and macromolecular diffusion. Testing such a model will require the development of approaches to visualize both lipid diffusion and intramembrane strand dynamics in live cells.

So what are the cellular functions and implications of the formation of this fence? It has been suggested that by restricting diffusion of both lipids and proteins in their membranes, cells can regulate the composition of their apical and basolateral compartments, thereby implicating the fence function in the establishment and maintenance of apicobasal cell polarity ${ }^{101}$. However, the overall importance of the fence for maintaining epithelial polarity is often overestimated: cells that have a defective junctional fence owing to expression of mutant form of occludin still polarize ${ }^{104}$. Even cells that lack tight junctions owing to combined removal of ZO1 and ZO2 still polarize and maintain at least some polarized lipid distribution ${ }^{105,106}$. It thus remains to be established to what extent the fence function is physiologically required for functional epithelia.

### Intramembrane diffusion barrier: the fence function

The junctional fence has been defined by diffusion experiments with fluorescent lipid probes and lipids, which demonstrated that tight junctions establish a diffusion barrier that restricts intermixing of apical and basolateral lipids in the exoplasmic plasma membrane leaflets ${ }^{100,101}$ (FIG. 2b). Although not directly demonstrated, as tight junctions restrict lipid diffusion in the exoplasmic leaflet, one would assume they also act as a fence for transmembrane proteins.

The fence function is assumed to be linked to the intramembrane strands because experimental manipulations that affect their integrity often also influence the functionality of the junctional fence, whereas perturbations that leave the intramembrane strands intact do not

### Assembly and links to apical polarity

Establishment of tight junctions is a multistep process that is guided and controlled by an array of distinct signalling mechanisms. Tight junction assembly is closely linked to apicobasal cell polarity, as it ultimately leads to cell surface polarization and the establishment of apical domains that are often organ-specific, such as the intestinal brush border membrane.

Focal adhesions  
Large, dynamic protein complexes that link the cytoskeleton of a cell to the extracellular matrix.

Tight junction assembly. Tight junction assembly is commonly studied in experiments involving changing Ca²⁺ concentrations in culture media. Cells, plated on a filter that enables transepithelial measurements of barrier formation, are first placed in a medium with a low calcium concentration that does not allow junction formation, and junction assembly is then induced by adding additional calcium¹⁰⁷,¹⁰⁸. Such experiments revealed that tight and adherens junctions are not morphologically well-defined during early junction assembly; instead they resemble the primordial junctional complexes observed in primitive nematodes and lie in the same plane as the basal, focal adhesions (BOX 2; FIG. 4a). The close relationship between tight and adherens junctions is reflected in biochemical interactions between core components of these junctions.

**Figure 3 | Structure of claudins and intercellular pore formation.**

a | Scheme of claudin structure and motifs. The crystal structure of claudin 15 has revealed a characteristic β-sheet fold of the two extracellular domains that is anchored to a transmembrane four-helix bundle (TM1–4). The two extracellular domains or ‘loops’ (ECL1 and ECL2) are important for ion-selectivity of the paracellular pathway owing to the presence of specific charged residues, which inversely correspond to the charge of the transported ions (for example, claudin 15 has negatively charged residues and forms a cation-selective pore). Claudins are thought to dimerize face to face through interactions between the edges of the extracellular β-sheets (mediating cell–cell interaction), as well as to interact with neighbouring claudin molecules in the same plasma membrane (here annotated as protein 1 (P1) and P2). Three of the transmembrane domains (TM1, 2 and 4; purple) have the exact length required to span a lipid bilayer; the third transmembrane domain (TM3; blue) is longer, and it is thought that this extended hydrophobic domain is important for the interaction with the adjacent protomer. The W-L-W-C-C motif is conserved in all mammalian claudins. The two C residues in ECL1 form a disulfide bond that is thought to stabilize the structure of ECL1. The W-L-W residues are located close to the extracellular membrane surface and are thought to function as hydrophobic anchors of the β-sheet domain. V1 and V2 refer to variable, flexible regions that may be important for the specificity of face-to-face interactions between claudin molecules on neighbouring cells (cell–cell interaction).

b,c | The interactions between claudin molecules in cis (that is, in the same membrane) and in trans (that is, with molecules in the membrane of the neighbouring cell) are thought to result in the formation of two antiparallel claudin polymers in each membrane and are proposed to represent the intramembrane strands seen in freeze fracture replicas. The two sets of antiparallel strands form intercellular adhesions by face-to-face interactions of claudin molecules, protomers, resulting in the formation of paracellular pores. These pores are thought to mediate ion permeability across tight junctions. Because they are formed by different claudins, the claudin composition of the junction determines ion selectivity in a given tissue. These paracellular pores are gated, meaning that they can be opened (open circles in part c) or closed (dashed circles in part c); however, the structural changes underlying gating and how opening and closing are regulated remain to be identified.
For instance, ZO1 and α-catenin, a protein that links adherens junctions to the actin cytoskeleton, form a complex in cells grown in low calcium; on the initiation of junction formation, this ZO1–α-catenin complex is recruited to forming junctions, coupling the assembly of tight and adherens junctions ${}^{109,110}$ (FIG. 4a). A central, coordinating part in junctional assembly is also played by nectins, which are adherens junction adhesion proteins that participate in the recruitment of JAMA ${}^{111}$. Early in junction assembly, JAMA localizes to nectin-based cell–cell contacts by interacting with ZO1, which itself is recruited to nectin through a bridge formed by afadin. The formation of mature tight and adherens junctions then requires the activation of multiple signalling mechanisms that include different isoforms of protein kinase C (PKC), PKA, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), protein phosphatases, small GTPases and heterotrimeric GTPases ${}^{43-45,108,112}$ (TABLE 1).

Many tight junction proteins interact with the actin cytoskeleton. Although the importance of individual interactions is still poorly understood, regulation of cytoskeletal dynamics is essential for junction formation and function. For example, myosin light chain kinase, a regulator of actomyosin activity, stimulates increased intestinal paracellular permeability during inflammation, a process that involves junctional remodelling and occludin internalization ${}^{113}$. RHO GTPases are major regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and consequently have fundamental roles in the regulation of junction assembly and function. The mechanisms that control RHO GTPase signalling have been intensively investigated, leading to the discovery of regulators that control specific processes by guiding the activity of RHOA, CDC42 and RAC ${}^{43,45}$. This includes guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for RHOA, p114RHOGEF (also known as RHO guanine nucleotide exchange factor 18 (ARHGEF18)) and ARHGEF11 that are recruited to forming junctions by cingulin, JACOP and ZO1, respectively, to promote RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK)-driven myosin activation and junction formation ${}^{114-116}$ (FIG. 4a). Similarly, the CDC42 GEF TUBA is recruited to tight junctions by ZO1 and tricellulin, and regulates the junctional actomyosin cytoskeleton ${}^{117,118}$. How these different mechanisms are coordinated with each other and are integrated into the cellular signalling networks that guide cell behaviour is still poorly understood and remains to be investigated in more detail.

Small GTPases

Heterotrimeric GTPases

supported by the CDC42 GEF ECT2, which associates with PAR3 and PAR6 recruited by JAMA. This further involves the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) RHOGAP interacting with CIP4 homologues protein 1 (RICH1; also known as ARHGAP17) and SH3 domain-binding protein 1 (SH3BP1), which complete the GTP exchange cycle of CDC42 (REFS 122–124). After cells start to polarize, activation of CDC42 at the apical pole and the apical margin close to tight junctions is catalysed by the GEF DBL3, which is recruited by another pro-apical signalling determinant, ezrin ${}^{125}$. Robust apical CDC42 activation then promotes aPKC activation, leading to phosphorylation and dissociation of PAR3 from the PAR3–PAR6–aPKC complex. The PAR6–aPKC complex then translocates to the differentiating apical membrane in a still poorly understood process, whereas PAR3 remains at tight junctions and marks the border between the apical and lateral domains. This process is essential for the development of specialized apical membrane domains, such as the intestinal brush border membrane, and drives the accumulation of apical signalling proteins (such as CRB3), as well as proteins that are required for apical functions (for example, brush border enzymes) ${}^{125}$. This mechanism of apical polarization is evolutionarily conserved and linked to the subapical zone and adherens junctions in *Drosophila melanogaster* ${}^{126,127}$ (BOX 2).

A second major pro-apical signalling complex, the CRB3–protein associated with Lin-7 1 (PALS1; also known as MPP5)–PATJ complex, also associates with tight junctions, and this occurs though interactions of PATJ with ZO3, claudin 1 and JAMA ${}^{128-130}$. CRB3 is a transmembrane protein that during apical differentiation is phosphorylated by aPKC, which involves an interaction with PAR6, thereby providing a link between the two pro-apical complexes ${}^{131}$. Activation of pro-apical signalling not only promotes apical differentiation but also leads to a suppression of pro-basolateral determinants ${}^{119,132}$. Consequently, the extent of apical CDC42 activation is a major determinant of the relative size of these two cellular domains and has a direct influence on the positioning of the apical–lateral border, and thereby on the positioning of tight junctions ${}^{125}$.

**Signalling from tight junctions**

It has become apparent that tight junctions, apart from serving as permeability barriers, are also important signalling platforms. As discussed above, assembly of these junctions is inherently linked to the establishment of epithelial apicobasal polarity. Additionally, tight junctions transmit signals to the cell interior to regulate the cytoskeleton, gene expression, cell proliferation and differentiation during various cellular processes (TABLE 1). These mechanisms have recently been reviewed ${}^{43,44,112}$, and here we only summarize some of the central principles and recent developments.

Tight junctions send signals to guide cell proliferation and differentiation, and their formation accompanies the establishment of epithelial sheets. The increasing cell density inhibits proliferation, and this process includes well-known regulators of cell

**Establishment of apical polarity.** The establishment of tight junctions is intimately linked with the signalling mechanisms that drive epithelial polarization ${}^{112,119}$. During the initial assembly of junctions, the adhesion protein JAMA recruits the partitioning defective 3 (PAR3)–PAR6–atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) complex ${}^{120,121}$, thereby establishing the forming border between the apical and the lateral domains (FIG. 4a; TABLE 1). The PAR3–PAR6–aPKC complex is an evolutionarily conserved signalling module that drives apical polarization in response to CDC42 activation. It is thought that early steps of junction formation are
proliferation, such as the Hippo-pathway transcriptional co-activators YES-associated protein 1 (YAP1) and transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ; also known as WWTR1). Tight junction-associated mechanisms modulate these transcription factors in various ways: the junctional complex recruits Hippo pathway kinases that phosphorylate and inhibit them and, similarly, the merlin tumour suppressor localizes at junctions and inhibits YAP1 and TAZ. Other apical proteins, including CRB3, ZO2, angiomotin and PAR3, have also been shown to modulate these transcriptional regulators ${ }^{133-138}$

In addition to YAP1 and TAZ, other proliferation-regulating transcription factors, including ZONAB, have been shown to localize to tight junctions as well as nuclei. In the nucleus, ZONAB promotes proliferation, and this function is inhibited by its retention at junctions. ZONAB has been shown to be inhibited by ZO1 binding; however, it also able to interact with other proteins at cell junctions, such as symplekin, RALA, GEFH1 (also known as ARHGEF2) and cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) ${ }^{23,24,139-142}$. Because ZONAB binds multiple proteins at tight junctions, removal of ZO1 alone may not be sufficient to disrupt junctional localization, which is in line with recent observations ${ }^{28}$. The same study also concluded that ZO1 does not bind ZONAB ${ }^{28}$. However, other studies have confirmed the ZO1–ZONAB interaction and have additionally suggested a molecular and functional link with claudin 2 (REFS 143–145).

The ZO1–ZONAB pathway is thought to influence cell proliferation by regulating the expression of ERBB2, cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) ${ }^{23,146}$, but this has recently been questioned

because no effect on the expression of these genes was  
detected in MDCK cells that were constitutively depleted  
of ZO1, ZO2 and ZO3 individually or in combination²⁸.  
However, these assays were performed in low-density,  
proliferating cells in which ZONAB is fully active and  
not inhibited by ZO1 (even overexpression of ZONAB  
does not stimulate proliferation in such cells)¹³⁹. The  
regulation of the ZO1–ZONAB pathway seems to be  
complex, and recent studies have identified various  
regulatory mechanisms of this pathway. For example,  
cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regula-  
tor (CFTR) binds and stabilizes ZO1. Consequently,  
absence of CFTR leads to reduced ZO1 stability and  
protein levels, thereby promoting nuclear transloca-  
tion of ZONAB, followed by induction of cyclin D1 and  
repression of ERBB2 (REF. 147). Manipulation of other  
junctional transmembrane proteins, such as BVES, has  
also been shown to regulate ZONAB activation through  
a GEFH1–RHOA-stimulated mechanism in which dis-  
ruption of BVES results in the release of GEFH1, and  

consequently RHOA and ZONAB, from tight junc-  
tions¹⁴⁰,¹⁴⁸. Regulation of ZONAB has also been impli-  
cated in the context of tumours. Here, the endothelial  
cells forming the blood–tumour barrier can increase  
their permeability in response to bradykinin. It has  
been revealed that bradykinin-induced activation of  
nitric oxide synthesis leads to ZONAB activation and its  
nuclear translocation, resulting in the repression of clau-  
din 5 and occludin promoters and, in consequence, the  
opening of tight junctions and increased permeability¹⁴⁹.  

ZO2 is yet another example of a protein with dual  
localization that can be found at junctions as well as in  
the nucleus, and its nuclear translocation is triggered  
by low cell density. In the nucleus, ZO2 interacts with  
several transcription factors, including important regu-  
lators of cell proliferation such as MYC, activator pro-  
tein 1 (AP1) and YAP1 (REF. 44), thus implicating ZO2 in  
the control of the cell cycle. In line with this, depletion  
of ZO2 in MDCK cells has been shown to induce an  
increase in cell size and enhanced cyclin D1 expression,  
and this has been linked to ZO2-mediated modulation  
of the YAP1 and AKT–mTOR pathways¹⁵⁰.  

Tight junctions can also signal to the cell interior  
through various classical signalling cascades, such as  
the JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) MAPK pathway  
that is regulated by an interaction between the mem-  
brane protein MARVELD3 and MEKK1 (also known  
as MAP3K1)⁴¹. This pathway regulates epithelial cell  
proliferation and migration, with MARVELD3 function-  
ing as a dynamic attenuator. The MEKK1–JNK pathway  
is inhibited when MARVELD3 is associated with tight  
junctions in the absence of a stimulus. In response  
to a stimulus, such as hypertonic stress, MARVELD3 is  
internalized to endosomes, which then allows MEKK1–  
JNK signalling. After internalization, MARVELD3  
is recycled back to tight junctions, and this is thought  
to once again downregulate MEKK1–JNK signalling.  
Therefore, the relative distribution of MARVELD3  
between tight junctions and endosomes determines the  
activity of the signal transmitted by the MEKK1–JNK  
pathway. Occludin, a close relative of MARVELD3, is also  
involved in MAPK-regulated signalling. By an as-yet-  
unknown mechanism, occludin inhibits RAF1-mediated  
dissociation of cell junctions, which is stimulated by ERK  
signalling¹⁵¹. Occludin interacts with multiple signalling  
proteins that may play a part in regulating the response  
to ERK signalling, and it has also been linked to trans-  
forming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-induced junction  
dissociation⁴²,¹⁵²,¹⁵³ (TABLE 1).

Signalling at tight junctions seems to play an important  
part in the cellular stress response, and ZO proteins have  
been linked to the maintenance of junctional integrity in  
response to stress in zebrafish and *Caenorhabditis elegans*,  
possibly with a role in regulating F-actin remodelling⁵¹,¹⁵⁴.  
Junctional signalling also affects general cell responses  
to stress; for instance, in addition to regulating prolifer-  
ation, the above-described MARVELD3–MEKK1–JNK  
pathway is important for cell survival during hyper-  
osmotic stress. Similarly, stress-induced ERK activation  
regulates cell survival through junctional signalling.  
Here, ERK activation stimulates the GEFH1–ZONAB

Figure 4 | Junction assembly and crosstalk between adhesion complexes.  
a | Epithelial cells form cell–cell junctions by assembling a primordial junction initiated by  
E-cadherin and nectin, leading to the recruitment of tight junction components owing to  
interactions between bona fide tight junction and adherens junction cytoplasmic plaque  
components, such as zonula occludens 1 (ZO1) and α-catenin. Subsequent increases in  
the recruitment of tight junction proteins and signalling proteins, such as guanine  
nucleotide exchange factors that activate signalling by RHOA and CDC42, induces  
junctional maturation, which involves the formation of distinct tight and adherens  
junctions, and a junctional enrichment of the actomyosin cytoskeleton. Myosin  
activation promotes the development of regular epithelial cell shapes (for example,  
columnar epithelia such as those in the intestinal tract). Finally, polarization is induced  
by polar activation of CDC42 along the apical domain and at the marginal zone close  
to tight junctions. Active CDC42 binds to the partitioning defective 3 (PAR3)–PAR6–  
atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) complex, leading to activation of the kinase, and  
induces development of a polarized cell surface with a well-specified apical cell  
membrane (for example, a brush border membrane in intestinal and many other  
epithelial cells). b | Complexes involved in cell adhesion are signalling hubs that send  
and receive signals that guide cell behaviour, function and morphogenesis; extensive  
crosstalk exists between different adhesion complexes. For example, junctional adhesion  
molecules (JAMs) are recruited to forming adherens junctions through interactions  
mediated by the tight junction protein ZO1 and the nectin-binding protein ALL1-fused  
gene from chromosome 6 protein (AF6). This leads to the increased recruitment of other  
junctional proteins and the activation of two small GTPases, RAP1 and RAP2, which  
regulate the functions of integrin-based focal adhesions and of adherens junctions.  
Forming tight junctions also recruit activators of RHO GTPases, including guanine  
nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) such as GEFH1 and p114RHOGEF (p114RG).  
GEFH1 is inactive at junctions, and tight junction dissociation triggers its release, leading  
to RHOA activation along the base of the cells. This stimulates the induction of stress  
fibres and increased focal-adhesion formation through the recruitment of proteins that  
regulate focal adhesions, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK). p114RG is recruited to  
tight junctions by forming a complex with cingulin and junction-associated coiled-coil  
protein (JACOP), which themselves are recruited by ZO1. p114RG then drives junctional  
RHOA activation, which, at least in endothelia, then coordinates junctional actomyosin  
activity, leading to increased cell–cell tension and pulling on cadherin-based adherens  
junctions by means of a molecular bridge between the actomyosin cytoskeleton and  
the cadherin formed by α- and β-catenin, as well as vinculin. Vinculin can be recruited to  
both adherens junctions, by interaction with α-catenin, and focal adhesions, by  
interaction with talin and α-actinin (the latter interaction is regulated by cytoskeletal  
tension pulling on the integrin adhesion complex). Claudin 7 and claudin 11 have been  
reported to form complexes with integrins and regulate migration; however, it is not yet  
clear whether this indeed represents another example of crosstalk between tight  
junctions and focal adhesions, or whether claudins act independently of tight junctions  
in this context.

pathway, which then post-transcriptionally regulates the expression of a central regulator of cell proliferation and survival, p21 (REFS 142,155). In the context of stress, ZONAB is also activated by heat shock. In this case, the activation is mediated by APG2, which competes with ZO1 for ZONAB binding²⁴. In summary, tight junctions seem to function as sensors for various signals, including cell stress, and orchestrate cell behaviours and fate in response to these stimuli.

### Crosstalk with other adhesion complexes

Different adhesion complexes that mediate interactions with neighbouring cells and the cell matrix are often considered in isolation, but it is important to note that they influence each other strongly. As we discussed above for junction assembly, such crosstalk can involve the formation of complexes containing components of different adhesion complexes. However, it can also involve the regulation of signalling pathways (FIG. 4b; TABLE 1). For example, JAMA-mediated cell–cell adhesion signals through two related small GTPases of the RAS-related protein family: RAP1 and RAP2. JAMA-stimulated RAP2 activation promotes stabilization of adherens junctions, whereas activation of RAP1 affects adhesion to the extracellular matrix and cell migration by regulating integrin-β1 expression and recycling¹⁵⁶⁻¹⁵⁹. In endothelial cells, ZO1 regulates overall cell–cell tension as well as tensile forces acting on adherens junctions by regulating recruitment of a complex formed by p114RHOGEF and JACOP, which stimulates junctional activation of myosin through the RHOA–ROCK2 pathway¹¹⁶. Loss of ZO1 also promotes formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions, indicating that signalling at tight junctions has cell-wide consequences on the cytoskeleton and adhesion. Orchestration of cell–cell tension and focal-adhesion formation by ZO1 is functionally important for the regulation of cell migration and angiogenesis. Whereas a role for ZO1 in suppressing focal-adhesion formation has so far only been demonstrated in endothelial cells, disruption of tight junction formation and stress-fibre formation through depletion of p114RHOGEF has been shown for both endothelial and epithelial cells¹¹⁴,¹¹⁶. The importance of tight junctions for stress-fibre and focal-adhesion formation is further indicated by the fact that both of these processes depend on GEFH1, which stimulates RHOA activity along the basal membrane and drives focal-adhesion formation in various cell types. However, GEFH1 can be recruited to tight junctions by cingulin, which leads to inhibition of its GEF activity (similar to the inhibition of this GEF by binding to microtubules), thereby inhibiting RHOA activation and impairing extracellular-matrix adhesions¹⁶⁰⁻¹⁶⁵ (TABLE 1).

In a similar way to crosstalk with adherens junctions, crosstalk between focal adhesions and tight junctions is not likely to be limited to signalling: it may also involve the formation of complexes between focal-adhesion and tight junction proteins, which then influence the functions of these proteins. For example, some claudins and JAMA have been shown to associate with integrin complexes and/or to regulate cell migration¹⁶⁶⁻¹⁷⁰; however,

it is not known whether such observations reflect independent roles of these proteins in integrin-based adhesion modulation or whether this is yet another example of the complex regulatory links between tight junctions and focal adhesions.

#### Conclusions and perspectives

Our understanding of tight junctions has vastly increased over the recent years. Rather than comprising a simple barrier, it is now clear that tight junctions fulfil multiple functions from forming a selective and regulated paracellular diffusion barrier to functioning as a bidirectional signalling hub that coordinates junction assembly and cell polarization with regulation of gene expression and cell proliferation. Tight junctions are a vertebrate-specific adhesion complex, but many of their functions and components are evolutionarily conserved, suggesting that many junctional functions and components were reorganized during evolution.

Despite substantial recent progress in structural and functional analyses of tight junctions, many open questions still remain. First of all, the topology of the adhering plasma membranes remains to be determined. In addition, a structural model needs to be developed that explains how different junctional transmembrane proteins that have different dynamic properties can be incorporated in the same branched intramembrane strand network and at the same time form intercellular protein complexes that serve as paracellular ion-selective pores and a lipid diffusion fence. Another long-standing question is the identity of the molecular mechanism that enables size-selective macromolecular paracellular diffusion. The current data regarding different junctional components and their response to physiological stimuli are compatible with a model based on a dynamic, remodelling strand network, but methods to visualize strand dynamics still need to be developed to validate this model. Furthermore, despite the fact that a wealth of exciting data have been generated linking particular junctional proteins to a specific junctional barrier or junctional functions, we still have a poor understanding of how different proteins cooperate to regulate such functions, how the junctional protein network adapts to removal of specific components, and how such modified junctions respond to different physiological and pathological stimuli. Tight junction-associated signalling mechanisms have now been firmly linked to the regulation of cell proliferation, polarization and differentiation, and many of these mechanisms are evolutionarily conserved even if they might be associated with a different type of junction in different phyla. Nevertheless, we still need to establish how exactly signalling initiated at junctions integrates into complex signalling pathways driving diverse cellular processes. Finally, analysis of the mechanisms through which the different adhesion complexes that mediate cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions communicate and cooperate with each other is likely to lead to exciting insights into the processes that mediate epithelial and endothelial tissue development and function.
