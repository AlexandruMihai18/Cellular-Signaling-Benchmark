**ABSTRACT**

The TGF-$\beta$ superfamily consists of a large group of pleiotropic cytokines that are involved in the regulation of many developmental, physiological and pathological processes. Dendritic cells are antigen-presenting cells that play a key role in innate and adaptive immune responses. Dendritic cells have a complex relationship with the TGF-$\beta$ cytokine superfamily being both source and targets for many of these cytokines. Some TGF-$\beta$ family members are expressed by dendritic cells and modulate immune responses, for instance through the induction of T cell polarization. Others play a crucial role in the development and function of the different dendritic cell subsets. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of TGF-$\beta$ family cytokines in dendritic cell biology, focusing on TGF-$\beta$ as well as on other, less characterized, members of these important immune mediators.

1. The heterogeneous family of dendritic cells

Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen-presenting cells crucial in initiating and shaping the outcome of immune response [1]. As immature cells, DCs patrol surrounding tissues, sampling for foreign antigens and pathogens. They express a broad range of receptors for the recognition of bacterial and viral components, including Toll-like receptors (TLR), NOD-like receptors and C-type lectin receptors [2]. Upon microbial contact or following stimulation by inflammatory cytokines, DCs undergo a maturation process characterized by the expression of co-stimulatory molecules and by a change in the repertoire of chemokine receptor expression causing the migration of DCs from the periphery to the draining lymph nodes where they meet naïve T cells [3,4].

DCs represent a very heterogeneous population that includes different subsets, which can be classified by origin, anatomic location, or phenotype [5]. Four major classes of DCs can be recognized: myeloid/conventional DCs (mDCs), plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), Langerhans cells (LCs), and monocyte-related/inflammatory DCs (for review see [5–8]). In human, mDCs can be divided into CD1c⁺ and CD141⁺ DC subsets, whereas in mice, mDCs include the migratory CD103⁻CD11b⁺ and CD103⁺CD11b⁻ DC subsets, as well as the lymphoid-resident CD8α⁺ and CD8α⁻ DCs [9,10]. pDCs are characterized by an extraordinary capacity to produce type I IFN upon recognition of viral and self nucleic acid through the pattern recognition receptors TLR7 and TLR9 [11,12]. Indeed, IFN-α production by pDCs represents a pathogenic mechanism in autoimmune diseases, such as in lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis [13]. LCs represent a particular DC subset that resides in skin epidermis and other stratified epithelia (reviewed in [14,15]). They are characterized by very high levels of the C-type lectin langerin (CD207), a pattern recognition receptor that recognizes carbohydrate moieties expressed by pathogens. Finally, in inflamed tissues, DCs may arise from monocytes and are referred to as “inflammatory dendritic cells”, which predominantly drive Th1 immunity (reviewed in [10,16]). Several inflammatory DC populations have been described, including Tip-DCs and inflammatory dendritic epidermal cells (IDEC) both observed in psoriasis and atopic dermatitis [17,18].

DCs have long been recognized as cells that promote the generation of effector CD4⁺ T helper 1 (Th1) cells, Th2 cells and Th17 cells, in response to viral, bacterial, parasitic worm and fungal infections [13,19]. In addition to their central function in orchestrating immunity, DCs can be instructed to promote peripheral tolerance through several mechanisms, including the generation of regulatory T cells and the induction of T-cell anergy/deletion [20,21]. This process is crucial for the maintenance of immune homeostasis and to limit uncontrolled inflammation. The tolerogenic adeptness of DCs depends on several factors, including their maturation state, the nature of the microbial stimuli, and the exposure to anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive molecules [22–24]. Important features of tolerogenic DCs are the capacity to express high levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (such as IL-10 and TGF-β) and a variety of immunoregulatory enzymes (such as Raldh2, HO-1 and IDO), which induce a tolerogenic T cell response [20,25,26].

2. The TGF-β superfamily

Members of the TGF-β superfamily are involved in the regulation of numerous cellular processes, including differentiation, proliferation, cytoskeletal organization, adhesion, and apoptosis. The TGF-β superfamily comprises more than 30 molecules, including three TGF-β isoforms and multiple forms of activins/ inhibins, bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs), growth differentiation factors (GDFs), NODAL, and the anti-Müllerian hormone

(AMH). The mature cytokines are usually homo-or heterodimers linked by disulphide bonds [27].

In general, TGF-β superfamily members are expressed as precursor proteins comprising a larger pro-domain, which is cleaved from the carboxy-terminal active domain by pro-protein convertases such as furin [27,28]. The pro-domains are essential for protein expression as they are required for the correct folding, for the disulphide bond formation and for the export of the mature protein. Usually, the pro-domains remain non-covalently bound to the mature protein even after secretion and in some cases, as shown for TGF-β1, TGF-β2, TGF-β3, myostatin, GDF-11 and BMP-10, the affinity of this binding is high enough to suppress their biological activity [28]. The pro-domain of TGF-β, called latency-associated peptide (LAP), is often additionally interacting with the so-called Latent TGF-β-binding proteins (LTBPs), which are important for the localization of TGF-β within the extracellular matrix [29,30]. In consequence, some TGF-β ligands are secreted as latent protein complexes that need further processing to become functionally active [28].

The TGF-β family members signal through a serine/threonine kinase receptor system, which includes type-1 and type-2 receptors. Various combinations of type-1 and type-2 receptors are used by the different TGF-β ligands (Table 1). Upon

ligand-binding, the corresponding type-1 receptor becomes phosphorylated by the constitutively active type-2 receptor, and the phosphorylated serines and threonins provide a binding site for Receptor-regulated Smads (R-Smads) [27,30]. R-Smads (Smad2/3 and Smad1/5/8) and the Common-mediator Smad (Co-Smad) Smad4 form heterotrimeric complexes, which translocate into the nucleus where they regulate gene transcription by direct binding to the DNA or by interacting with other transcription factors [27,30]. Finally, Inhibitory Smads (I-Smads) Smad6 and Smad7 provide a third class of Smads that act as negative regulators of TGF-β signaling. The Smad-dependent signal transduction represents the best understood TGF-β signaling pathway and is usually referred to as the “canonical” TGF-β pathway. However, alternative signaling molecules, such as the Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3β (GSK3β), the cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) or the small GTPases as well as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), such as p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK), are known to interact with Smads or to be directly activated by the interaction with the receptors (reviewed in [30,31]).

The regulation of TGF-β signaling occurs at many levels. The binding of TGF-β ligands to the receptor complex is controlled by extracellular ligand-binding proteins, such as follistatin, noggin and chordin [30]. For instance, the ubiquitously expressed follistatin binds activin A with high affinity, thereby strongly limiting the amount of bioavailable circulating activin A [32]. Moreover, coreceptors such as β-glycan, endoglin and Cripto, as well as other transmembrane proteins, such as BAMBI (BMP and activin membrane-bound inhibitor), provide a further level of regulation (recently reviewed in [30]).

TGF-β family ligands have essential functions in the regulation of reproduction, early development and tissue homeostasis but are also importantly involved in many other biologic processes, including angiogenesis, wound healing, and the control of the immune response [27,33]. Perturbation of their physiological functions may be causative for the development of autoimmune diseases and cancer [27]. Mice lacking TGF-β1, the prototypic member of the TGF-β family ligands, die early in life from multi-organ inflammation, underlining its fundamental role in immunity [34–36].

### 3. Activation of TGF-β by dendritic cells

Given its fundamental and multifunctional role in immune regulation, together with the fact that a number of cell types release TGF-β in a constitutive manner to maintain immune homeostasis, it is not surprising that the activity of released TGF-β requires rigorous regulation. As mentioned before, all three TGF-β isoforms are released as a latent protein complex, which needs to be separated for activation. Different molecules are involved in TGF-β activation, including the extracellular matrix protein thrombospondin 1 or enzymes, such as cathepsin D, plasmin and matrix metalloproteinases (recently reviewed by [37]). DCs may play a crucial role in TGF-β activation. They are an important source of the matrix metalloproteinases MMP-9 and MMP-14, both implicated in TGF-β activation. In addition, thrombospondin 1 expression by DCs was proposed to promote TGF-β-driven Th17 cell polarization [38–40]. Recent work demonstrated that the integrins αvβ6 and αvβ8 play a fundamental role in TGF-β activation, with αvβ8+ DCs being particularly involved in this process. In agreement with the pleiotropic functions of TGF-β (see below), integrin αvβ8-mediated TGF-β activation by DCs is a key mechanism that controls both tolerogenic and inflammatory immune responses. Thus, mice lacking αvβ8 on CD11c+ DCs show a reduction in Foxp3+ T regulatory (Treg) cells in the colon paralleled by increased T cell activation and development of autoimmunity

and colitis [34,41]. Interestingly, the tolerogenic CD103+ DC intestinal subset expresses high levels of αvβ8 integrins and is therefore particularly competent in TGF-β activation and Foxp3+ Treg cell induction [42]. On the other hand, deletion of αvβ8 on DCs leads to reduced numbers of Th17 cells during autoimmune disease and consequently to protection from EAE and airway hyper-responsiveness [43–45].

### 4. Dendritic cells as targets of TGF-β family ligands

#### 4.1. Regulation of DC differentiation by TGF-β family ligands

DC development and differentiation are guided by growth factors and cytokines produced by the local microenvironment. For instance, Flt3, M-CSF and GM-CSF are essential growth factors during DC development from multipotent precursors into common DC progenitors (CDPs) and their further differentiation into various DC subsets [46,47].

An increasing number of evidence emphasizes the crucial role of TGF-β family ligands at different stages of DC differentiation. Accordingly, treatment of multipotent progenitor cells (MPPs) with TGF-β1 results in the upregulation of DC-associated genes, including Flt3, Irf8 and Irf4, suggesting that TGF-β1 induces DC commitment in MPPs [48]. Furthermore, TGF-β1 accelerates DC differentiation from CDPs directing their differentiation toward a mDC phenotype at the expense of pDC development [49,50].

The involvement of TGF-β in LC development was proposed almost 20 years ago, demonstrating that TGF-β null mice completely lack LCs [51]. The critical role for TGF-β1 in LC development was further sustained by a body of data obtained *in vitro* and *in vivo*. *In vitro*, TGF-β1 drives the differentiation of CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells toward an LC phenotype [52,53]. Similarly, TGF-β1 directs the differentiation of monocytes into LCs in the presence of GM-CSF and IL-4 [54]. The specific deletion of TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 in LCs results in reduced numbers of epidermal LCs [55–58]. Moreover, mice deficient for Id2 and Runx3, both components of the TGF-β signaling cascade, have an impaired LC development [59,60]. These observations allow the conclusion that TGF-β1 influence LC homeostasis. However, our understanding about the precise role of TGF-β during LC differentiation remains still incomplete. In fact, LCs are unique in their development. Unlike other DC populations, LCs derive from embryonic precursors that seed the skin prior to birth and self-renew under steady-state conditions. Curiously, LCs can be found in sites devoid of TGF-β1 such as basal keratinocyte layers and in the prenatal epidermis [61,62], suggesting that additional factors regulate LC ontogeny and homeostasis. In this regard it was found that BMP-7 promotes LC differentiation through the activation of BMPR1A, in the absence of the canonical TGF-β1/TGFBR1 signaling, and that BMP7-deficient mice exhibit substantially diminished LC numbers. BMP-7 is strongly expressed in the fetal epidermis at the time LCs are present and TGF-β1 is still undetectable. Moreover, in adult epidermis, BMP-7 shows an inverse expression pattern with respect to TGF-β1, being expressed in the basal keratinocyte layer, while TGF-β1 is detectable in the outer epidermal layers [63]. Thus, the two different TGF-β family members seem to have a complementary role in LC biology, with BMP-7 inducing the differentiation and proliferation of LCs, while TGF-β1 would ensure the maintenance of the LC network by hampering the migration of LCs to the draining lymph nodes (see below).

In an inflammatory condition alternative pathways might have a role in LC differentiation. During inflammation the increased turnover of LCs is sustained at least in part by circulating blood-derived precursors, such as monocytes or

CD1c⁺ DCs, which are recruited to the dermis and epidermis to repopulate the LC pool [64–66]. Activin A, which is abundantly expressed during certain inflammatory conditions, was proposed to have a role in LC differentiation in reactive conditions. A positive correlation between activin A expression and the number of LCs was found in lung small airways and in Lichen Planus skin biopsies, both in the epidermis and in the dermis [67,68]. Furthermore, injection of activin A in human skin explants induced a strong increase in the number of Langerin⁺/CD1a⁺ cells in both the epidermal and dermal compartments. Interestingly, *in vitro*, the induction of LC differentiation by activin A occurred independently from TGF-β1 [68]. In line with these observations, a significant increase in the numbers of LCs was found in the skin of activin A-overexpressing mice treated with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate and transgenic mice overexpressing follistatin, a binding molecule of activin A, presented a reduced number of LCs in the skin [69,70]. In conclusion, available data strongly suggest that different TGF-β family ligands are involved in DC development, in particular in the differentiation of LCs, and that each protein may have a complementary, rather than redundant, role in DC regulation (Fig. 1).

### 4.2. Regulation of DC activity by TGF-β family ligands

DCs express, at least at transcriptional level, type I receptors (ACVR1, ACVR1B, BMPR1A/B, TGFBR1) and type II receptors (TGFBR2, BMPR2, ACVR2A and ACVR2B). They also express all components of the principal signaling cascades, including the R-Smads Smad1/5/8 and Smad2/3, as well as the Co-Smad Smad4 [63,71,72]. As a consequence, DCs are equipped to respond to almost all the TGF-β family ligands, although so far main investigative efforts were concentrated on TGF-β1 (Fig. 2).

#### 4.2.1. Induction of a DC tolerogenic phenotype by TGF-β family ligands

Genetically modified mice with inactivated DC-specific TGF-β signaling components suffer of multi-organ autoimmune disease, have more severe experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), accelerated atherosclerosis and die early in life [73–75]. Generally, DCs acquire a regulatory phenotype in the presence of TGF-β, meaning a functional phenotype that favors the promotion of a tolerogenic immune response. In DCs, TGF-β downregulates the expression of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-12 and IFN-α, and promotes the release of regulatory cytokines, including TGF-β itself [74,76–78]. Although a certain degree of discrepancy exists among different studies [73], TGF-β was shown to inhibit the expression of DC maturation markers, such as CD83, CD80 and CD86, as well as MHCII molecules [53,58,79–81]. Indeed, TGF-β overexpression in the tumor microenvironment can suppress DC maturation and function, resulting in defects in the tumor-specific immune response [81,82]. Furthermore, in CD8⁻ DCs, TGF-β induces the upregulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that is associated with immunosuppressive functions [83]. IDO catalyzes the rate-limiting step of the primary tryptophan metabolism route leading to tryptophan deprivation and production of downstream tryptophan metabolites with suppressive activities [84,85]. In mouse pDCs, TGF-β was shown to induce the phosphorylation of IDO ITIM motifs, in addition to the upregulation of SHP-1 and SHP-2, thereby regulating IDO functions at a level independent from its catalytic activity [86]. Phosphorylation of IDO leads to amplification and long-term maintenance of a regulatory condition through the sustained production of TGF-β and the release of type I IFN, which promote IDO expression [85,86].

Other TGF-β ligands, such as activin A, were described to have regulatory effects on DCs. *In vitro*, the inhibition of endogenous

Fig. 2. Members of the TGF-$\beta$ family modulate DC functions. DCs express type-1 (ACVR1, ACVR1B, BMPR1A, BMPR1B, TGFBR1) and type-2 receptors (TGFBR2, BMPR2, ACVR2A, ACVR2B) to respond to different TGF-$\beta$ family ligands. Generally, DC maturation markers (e.g., CD80, CD83, CD86, MHC class II) and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines are inhibited by TGF-$\beta$ family ligands. Impairment of maturation affects DC-T cell interactions and priming of adaptive immunity. TGF-$\beta$ family ligands also affect DC motility through the regulation of the expression of chemokines and chemokine receptors.

activin A by follistatin upregulates cytokine expression (e.g., IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, TNF-$\alpha$, and IL-10) induced by CD40L stimulation [71]. Similarly, neutralization of activin A, produced by DCs during NK-DC interactions, increased the expression of cytokines, such as IL-6, IL8, and TNF-$\alpha$, and upregulated DC maturation [87]. Interestingly, although LPS is a powerful inducer of activin A in DCs, activin A does not seem to affect LPS-induced cytokine production or DC maturation [71,88].

Recently, GDF-15, a protein involved in various pathologies, including cancer, obesity, and inflammatory diseases, was found to bind to immature DCs [89,90]. GDF-15, similarly to activin A, downregulates DC maturation markers (e.g., CD83, CD86), inhibits the formation of membrane protrusions, and preserves the capacity to capture antigens upon DC activation [87–89,91].

Up to now, only little data is available concerning the effects of BMPs and GDFs on DCs. Inhibition of endogenous BMP signaling during DC maturation, utilizing the small compound Dorsomorphin, decreased the surface expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and PD-L2, while leaving the expression of the costimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 unaltered. Thus, also some BMPs may promote a regulatory DC phenotype [92]. On the other hand, exogenous BMP-4 was observed to promote DC maturation and the expression of proinflammatory cytokines [72].

### 4.2.2. Influence of TGF-$\beta$ family ligands on DC motility

TGF-$\beta$ family ligands also affect DC migration [57,58,93–95]. TGF-$\beta$ upregulates the expression of the chemokine receptors CCR1, CCR3, CCR5, CCR6, and CXCR4, thereby enhancing DC migration in response to the cognate ligands CCL3, CCL5, CCL11, CCL20, and CXCL12 [95]. On the other hand, TGF-$\beta$ inhibits the expression of CCR7 on DCs [57,58,93,95]. Accordingly, TGF-$\beta$1 is required for the maintenance of LCs in the epidermis during steady-state conditions as interruption of TGF-$\beta$ signaling in LCs leads to spontaneous migration of LCs from the epidermis into the skin-draining lymph nodes, probably due to the downregulation of E-cadherin and de novo expression of CCR7 [57,58]. The capacity of TGF-$\beta$ to hamper DC migration might also be important in tumor progression as TGF-$\beta$ expressed by tumor cells immobilizes DCs within the tumors and this action is associated with increased tumor dissemination in draining lymph nodes [96]. In contrast to these observations, overexpression of TGF-$\beta$1 in keratinocytes causes increased LC migration following skin application of dibutyl phthalate. In these mice, LCs, pDCs, and different subsets of dermal DCs were increased in skin-draining lymph nodes and dermis, suggesting a generally altered homeostasis of skin DCs in the presence of high levels of TGF-$\beta$1 [97].

Activin A downregulates the expression of a number of chemokines (e.g., CCL2, CCL5, CXCL8, and CXCL10) in CD40L-activated DCs [71]. On the other hand, increased expression of activin A correlates with augmented DC tissue infiltration and, in vitro, it promotes the migration of immature DCs inducing the polarized release of CXCL12 and CXCL14 [68,70,94,98]. Finally, activin A was shown to upregulate CCR10 and to downregulate CCR4 in allergen-stimulated CD1c$^+$ DCs obtained from atopic subjects, an effect that correlated with the increased number of CD1c$^+$ DCs infiltrating inflamed skin after allergen challenge [99].

### 5. Expression of TGF-$\beta$ family ligands by dendritic cells

DCs express a large spectrum of cytokines, and recently, several members of the TGF-$\beta$ family were added to their repertoire [71,88,92,100]. In fact, the expression of TGF-$\beta$ by DCs was observed in both homeostatic and pathological conditions and was recognized as a key regulatory mechanism of immune response. Successively, the production of other members of the family, including activin A and different BMPs, was described [71,87,88,92]. However, a complete characterization of the expression profile and function of TGF-$\beta$ family ligands in relation to DC pathophysiology is still missing. Moreover, most of the studies were conducted with in vitro-generated monocyte-derived

Fig. 3. TGF-β family ligands as mediators of DC functions. Panel A. In homeostatic conditions DCs constitutively produce TGF-β, while releasing only low amounts of activin A and BMPs. The expression of TGF-β is enhanced by TGF-β produced by other cells (e.g. Treg cells) or by TGF-β localized within the extracellular matrix. DCs usually release TGF-β in a latent membrane-bound form, complexed with its prodomain. DC-derived TGF-β modulates innate and adaptive immune cell functions. It inhibits Th1 and Th2 polarization and induces the differentiation of Foxp3+ Treg cells in combination with retinoic acid. TGF-β also downregulates major NK cell functions, such as proliferation, cytotoxic activity and IFN-γ expression. Moreover, DCs play a role in the activation of TGF-β via the integrin αvβ8 and the release of MMPs and thrombospondin 1. Panel B. In

TGF-$\beta$ is expressed by DCs mainly in its latent form, non-covalently associated with LAP (Fig. 3A). DCs may release TGF-$\beta$ into the environment or present it on the cell surface to other cells [100]. Generally, TGF-$\beta$ is expressed in a constitutive manner by immature DCs, and the expression decreases usually upon cell activation [57,82,101–104]. On the other hand, signals that sustain the immature DC phenotype, including inhibitory molecules, such as glucocorticosteroids, or phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, increase TGF-$\beta$ expression [101,105–108]. For example, in vivo uptake of apoptotic T cells or even apoptotic DCs upregulate TGF-$\beta$ expression by immature DCs [101,106,108].

In accordance with the particular requirement of maintaining tolerance in the presence of the intestinal microflora and dietary antigens, intestinal DCs from the lamina propria, the mesenteric lymph nodes or peyer's patches are better producers of TGF-$\beta$ than DCs from other organs, such as spleen or skin-draining LN [109,110]. In particular intestinal CD103$^+$ DCs express elevated levels of TGF-$\beta$ [109–111]. In spleen, TGF-$\beta$ is preferentially expressed by a subset of CD8$^+$CD205$^+$ DCs, whereas CD8-DCIR$^+$ DCs are only poor producers [102,107]. Also human pDCs express significant amounts of TGF-$\beta$, and human blood CD1c$^+$ DCs express higher TGF-$\beta$ levels compared to CD141$^+$ DCs [78,100,112].

In contrast to TGF-$\beta$, only few data are available concerning the expression of other TGF-$\beta$ family ligands by DCs (Fig. 3B). Activin A expression is upregulated upon exposure to inflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-$\alpha$), bacteria and TLR ligands, such as LPS and R-848 [71,88]. In the absence of pathogens, activin A may be induced by the interaction of DCs with other cell types, such as activated NK cells. The induction of activin A expression by NK cells requires cell-to-cell contact and is mainly mediated by the production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$ and GM-CSF [87]. CD40 stimulation was also shown to trigger the expression of activin A in DCs, suggesting that activin A may also be produced during interactions with other cell types expressing CD40L, such as activated T cells [71,88]. It can be concluded, that while TGF-$\beta$ and activin A share the same Smad2/3-dependent signal pathways and apparently possess overlapping functions, at least in DCs, activin A is regulated in an opposite way to TGF-$\beta$. Indeed, TGF-$\beta$ is mainly expressed in immune homeostatic conditions, whereas activin A requires a proinflammatory environment. Among human blood DC subsets, activin A is expressed exclusively by myeloid DCs, including CD1c$^+$ DCs, CD141$^+$ DCs, but not by pDCs [71,87,88]. Finally, similarly to activin A, BMP-2, BMP-4 and BMP-6 were reported to be upregulated during DC maturation in the presence of proinflammatory cytokines, LPS or upon CD40 activation [87,92].

#### 6.1. Effect of DC-derived TGF-$\beta$ family ligands on T cell activity

TGF-$\beta$ ligands play an important role during proliferation, survival, polarization and activation of T cells. TGF-$\beta$ down-regulates T cell activation at the level of TCR signaling [113]. TGF-$\beta$ also inhibits Th1 and Th2 polarization suppressing the expression of the transcriptional factors T-bet and GATA-3 in CD4$^+$ T cells, and downregulates CD8$^+$ T cell proliferation and cytotoxic activity [29,34,114,115]. The neutralization of TGF-$\beta$ expressed by DCs leads to increased Th1 polarization, whereas TGF-$\beta$ derived from CD8$^+$ spleen DCs was shown to downregulate Th2 cytokine expression in an asthma-like disease model [100,116].

Most importantly, TGF-$\beta$ induces T regulatory (Treg) cells [117]. The main function of Tregs is to suppress immune responses to self antigens and to control the response to pathogens of effector T cells, in order to limit infection-induced immunopathologies. At difference from “naturally” occurring Treg (nTreg) cells, which are generated in the thymus, induced Treg (iTreg) cells differentiate in peripheral tissues, or in the gut mucosa, where they maintain tolerance to self antigens, food antigens, and commensal bacteria [117]. To acquire and maintain a functional regulatory phenotype, CD4$^+$ T cells express the transcription factor Foxp3 [117,118]. In mice, the deletion of Foxp3 results in a fatal inflammatory disease similar to that observed following TGF-$\beta$1 deletion [118,119]. The expression of Foxp3 is controlled by several regulatory regions, including an important enhancer within the conserved non-coding sequence 1 (CNS1) that contains a critical Smad3 binding site [120,121]. As a consequence, the activation of the Smad3-dependent signaling pathway by TGF-$\beta$ represents a crucial mechanism in the induction of Treg cell differentiation. TGF-$\beta$1 and TGF-$\beta$2 convert CD4$^+$ T cells into Tregs, in particular in the presence of retinoic acid, which increases the expression and phosphorylation of Smad3 [109,110,122,123].

In addition to TGF-$\beta$ signaling, Treg cell induction depends on TCR triggering, and this indirectly implies a role for DCs, the most potent antigen-presenting cells, which can provide both signals to T cells [102]. Conversion of naïve CD4$^+$ T cells into Treg cells occurs primarily in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue following oral exposure to antigen [110]. In the intestine, in particular CD103$^+$ DCs are potent inducers of Foxp3 expression in CD4$^+$ T cells, whereas the capacity of CD103$^-$ DCs to induce differentiation of Treg cells is remarkably weaker and requires the presence of exogenous TGF-$\beta$ and retinoic acid [110,111]. The superior capacity of mucosal CD103$^+$ DCs in inducing Treg differentiation correlates with their higher endogenous expression of TGF-$\beta$ and an abundance of factors important for an increased TGF-$\beta$ activity (e.g. tissue plasminogen activator, the $\alpha$V$\beta$8 integrin and LTBP3) [42,109,111,124]. Specifically, CD103$^+$ DCs in MLN express high level of TGF-$\beta$2 promoted by the elevated constitutive MAP kinase p38$\alpha$ activity present in these cells. Moreover, p38$\alpha$ in CD103$^+$ is also required for the expression of retinal dehydrogenase an enzyme crucial for the conversion of the production of vitamin A into retinoic acid [109,111]. Similarly, CD103$^+$ lung DCs represent the main pulmonary DC subset responsible for the establishment of airway tolerance, and in spleen, CD8$^+$ DCs are the DC subset with a superior Treg cell inducing capacity [102,116,124,125].

Also activin A was shown to induce functional CD4$^+$ Treg cells in a model of allergic airway disease [126]. Activin A-induced Treg cells are CD4$^+$CD25$^-$Foxp3$^-$IL-10-expressing cells, which suggests that activin A induces a Tr1-like phenotype [126]. Hence, activin A and TGF-$\beta$ seem to induce the generation of different subsets of regulatory T cells. In this regard it may be of interest that in CD4$^+$CD25$^-$ naïve T cells, activin A was described to induce a fast activation of MAP kinases followed by a later activation of an inflammatory context, DCs upregulate the expression of activin A and BMPs (e.g. BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6). The expression of these cytokines is induced by TLR ligands, such as bacteria-derived LPS, by CD40-CD40L interaction, or by the action of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, GM-CSF), produced for instance during NK-DC interactions. Activin A favors T cell polarization into IL-10-expressing Tr1 cells. However, in combination with TGF-$\beta$, activin A and some BMPs induce the differentiation of Foxp3$^+$ Treg cells. Activin A also inhibits IFN-$\gamma$ production by NK cells, whereas other members of the family, such as BMPs, upregulate NK cell cytokine production, proliferation and cytotoxicity. Activated DCs also express TGF-$\beta$, which may induce Th17 polarization in the presence of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6, and IL-23.

Smad2, with no Smad3 activation. In contrast, TGF-$\beta$ also activates Smad3 signaling, which is known to be critical for Foxp3 expression [121,127]. Nevertheless, activin A was shown to promote TGF-$\beta$-dependent conversion of CD4${}^{+}$CD25${}^{-}$ T cells into CD4${}^{+}$CD25${}^{+}$Foxp3${}^{+}$ Treg cells, possibly through the increase of MAP kinase and Smad2/3 signaling [127]. The in vivo relevance of DC-derived activin A is not clear yet, it may however be hypothesized that the relatively high levels of activin A expressed by DCs contribute to the alteration of the T cell subset balance, favoring regulatory or type 2 T cell polarization. Finally, similarly to activin A, also BMP-2 and BMP-4 promote the differentiation of naïve T cells into Foxp3${}^{+}$ Treg cells in vivo and in vitro in synergy with TGF-$\beta$, but not alone. This synergistic effect is dependent on ERK and JNK MAP kinase signaling [128,129].

In conclusion TGF-$\beta$ ligands have important regulatory functions in immune responses. They downregulate T effector cell functions and induce Treg cells, thereby limiting dangerous hyperreactive responses. However, TGF-$\beta$ ligands are pleiotropic cytokines and the outcome of their signaling is dictated by the local tissue microenvironment [130]. For instance, using different experimental protocols, inhibition of activin A was found to reduce, rather than to promote, Th2 responses through the downregulation of Th2 cytokines and IgE production [131,132]. Importantly, TGF-$\beta$ has also a role in Th17 differentiation. Th17 cells, through the production of several cytokines (e.g. IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-22), play a key role in protective immune responses to fungal and bacterial pathogens, but are also importantly involved in many inflammatory disorders, such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis or inflammatory bowel disease [133]. A number of studies have identified TGF-$\beta$ in combination with IL-6 as the critical cytokines for Th17 differentiation of naïve T cells [134–138]. Both TGF-$\beta$ and IL-6 are released by DCs upon phagocytosis of apoptotic B cells thereby directing Th17 differentiation [139]. Also monocyte-derived Langerhans cells, which constitutively release TGF-$\beta$, promote Th17 polarization after TLR2 activation and release of IL-1$\beta$, IL-6 and IL-23 [103]. TGF-$\beta$ expressed by tumor-infiltrating pDCs induce Th17 cell differentiation in the presence of CpG oligonucleotides [140] and unexpectedly the treatment of pDCs with TGF-$\beta$ induced the release of both TGF-$\beta$ and IL-6, enabling pDCs for the polarization of naïve CD4${}^{+}$ T cells into Th17 cells [78].

### 6.2. DC-derived TGF-$\beta$ family ligands modulate NK cell activity

In accordance with the role of DCs as key components within the interactive network of immune cells, DCs serve as an important link between the adaptive and innate immune response. In this context, interactions between DCs and NK cells have been well described to reciprocally regulate their effector functions with consequences also for adaptive immune responses. Of note, the activity of NK cells is modulated by TGF-$\beta$ family ligands, such as activin A, BMPs and TGF-$\beta$ [141–146]. As mentioned before, high levels of activin A are directly induced in DCs through the interaction with activated NK cells. Within this context, activin A functions as a negative feedback mechanism for DCs, down-regulating DC maturation and cytokine production [87]. In the presence of proinflammatory cytokines and TLR ligands, the addition of the activin A-natural inhibitor follistatin to NK-DC cocultures resulted in higher production of IFN-$\gamma$ by NK cells, suggesting an additional inhibitory role of DC-derived activin A on NK cells [142]. On the contrary, the inhibition of the BMP signaling downregulated NK cytotoxicity, proliferation and cytokine production [141]. Finally, also TGF-$\beta$ exerts many effects on NK cells, including the inhibition of cytokine secretion, proliferation, cytotoxicity, and the downregulation of activating receptors, such as NKG2D and NKp30 [143–146]. Indeed, the neutralization of

TGF-$\beta$ in NK-DC cocultures augmented NK cell functions, including NK cell cytotoxicity [147].

## 7. Concluding remarks

The data so far available strongly emphasize the importance of TGF-$\beta$ family ligands in the regulation of DC functions. Production of cytokines of the TGF-$\beta$ family by DCs strongly impacts adaptive immunity, being involved in T cell polarization, and in the induction of Treg cells. On the other hand TGF-$\beta$ ligands act as important modulators of DC biology, influencing differentiation, maturation, cytokine production and migration. Many aspects of the impact of TGF-$\beta$ family ligands on DC functions remain insufficiently explored. For instance, most of the in vivo data are confined to the action of TGF-$\beta$, while knowledge for other members of the family are still scanty and based only on in vitro experiments. The lack of in vivo data is particularly relevant in relation to the fact that the members of the TGF-$\beta$ family are pleiotropic with a complex concentration- and context-dependent behavior, making in vitro predictions even less reliable. It is likely that future investigations on other members of this large family will reveal new and possibly unexpected regulatory and functional mechanisms of the human immune response.

Pascal Seeger graduated in Molecular Life Science (Master of Science) at the University of Lübeck (Germany) in 2007. During this period he performed prolonged internships at the University Louis Pasteur (Strasbourg, France), at the University of Turku (Finland) and at the G. Gaslini Institute (Genoa, Italy). In 2008, he joined the laboratory of Prof. Silvano Sozzani at the University of Brescia (Italy) where he obtained his PhD in 2013. He focused his interest on the molecular events during the crosstalk between natural killer cells and dendritic cells, including the role of TGF-β family ligands during these interactions. His current interests also include the study of the regulation and function of chemotactic receptors.

Silvano Sozzani is Professor in General Pathology and Chairman of the Department of Molecular and Translational Medicine at the University of Brescia, Italy. In 1983, he graduated from the School of Pharmacy of the University of Pavia, Italy. In 1988, during his post-doctoral stage at the Department of Biochemistry at Wake Forest University, NC, USA, he started to work on the signal transduction of chemotactic receptors. Since then his research interests have been focusing on the role chemokines and chemokine receptors in phagocyte and dendritic cell biology. These studies led to the description of the “chemokine receptor switch” during dendritic cell maturation and to the characterization of new chemokines and chemokine receptors. He is member of the Editorial board of several scientific journals. He is author of more than 250 original articles and reviews on peer-reviewed journals (H-index = 90).

Tiziana Musso obtained her PhD in Biology in 1986 at the University of Torino. From 1988 to 1995 she was a Researcher at the Biological Carcinogenesis and Developmental Program, National Cancer Institute, Frederick, USA and she mainly studied the IL-2 signaling pathway in human monocytes. She is Associate Professor at the School of Medicine, University of Torino. Her research is focused on the impact of the immune and inflammatory response in microbial infections with emphasis on the regulation of cytokines in dendritic cells.
