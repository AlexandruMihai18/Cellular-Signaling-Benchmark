**Abstract** Neurodegenerative diseases are featured by progressive dysfunction and death of cells in selected areas in the nervous system, determining clinical presentation. Neuronal loss is associated with conformational changes in proteins that result in extra- and intra-cellular accumulation of misfolded proteins, representing the hallmarks of many neurodegenerative disorders, summarized as proteinopathies. Intermediate forms such as oligomers and protofibrils are thought to have cytotoxic effects to neurons. Major basic processes, caused by genetic, environmental, and endogenous factors, in addition to abnormal protein dynamics with defective degradation due to deficiency of the ubiquitin-proteasomal-autophagy system, include oxidative stress and free radical formation, impaired bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of neuronal Golgi apparatus and transport, molecular chaperones, neurotrophins and “neuroinflammatory” processes. These mechanisms are interrelated in vicious circles finally leading to programmed cell death. A common feature of these conditions is a long run until sufficient protein accumulates, followed by a cascade of symptoms over many years with increasing disability leading to death. This provides a wide therapeutic window, especially in groups at risk identified early and preclinical diagnosis becomes feasible. Neurodegenerative disorders are classified according to known genetic mechanisms or to the major components of protein deposits. Although this has been a productive paradigm for the development of diagnostic consensus criteria, recent molecular biologic and genetic approaches have revealed that there are both overlap and intraindividual diversities between different phenotypes, related to synergistic mechanisms between major pathologic proteins (β-amyloid, tau, α-synuclein, TDP-43), suggesting common pathogenic mechanisms. The nature, time course, and molecular causes of cell degeneration and demise, and the role of various pathogenic factors are a matter of considerable debate, but recent studies have provided insight into the basic processes in neurodegeneration and the roles of cell death programs common to this complex group of disorders, offering new ways for future prevention and treatment strategies.

Basic processes common to neurodegeneration (ND)

Neurodegenerative disorders (NDD) are characterized by progressive dysfunction and loss of neurons and synapses in selected (vulnerable) areas of the nervous system, determining clinical presentation and course. The major basic processes inducing ND are considered multifactorial caused by genetic, environmental, and endogenous factors related to aging, but their pathogenic role and their basic molecular mechanisms are not fully understood (Forman et al. 2004; Jellinger 2003, 2007a; Ovadi and Orosz 2009; Selkoe 2004; Skovronsky et al. 2006). NDDs have traditionally been defined as clinico-pathologic entities; now they are classified according to known genetic mechanisms and/or to the major compounds of their protein deposits (Table 1; Fig. 1). Due to the involvement of critical conformational changes of proteins, these disorders are often denoted as “protein misfolding” diseases (Gregersen 2006; Winderickx et al. 2008) or proteinopathies (Forman et al. 2004, 2007). Over the last several decades there has been great progress with respect to the triggers of most NDDs. Converging lines of investigation have revealed potential common pathogenic mechanisms underlying many diverse NDDs. They include:

misfolded proteins with formation of high-ordered insoluble fibrils are common pathological hallmarks of many, albeit diverse, NDDs (see Herczenik and Gebbink 2008; Jellinger 2007a; Kovacs and Budka 2009; Woulfe 2007). If mutations in sequence or changes in environmental conditions lead to partial unfolding of the native state of a protein, it will often aggregate, sometimes into well-defined fibrillar structures (Morris et al. 2009; Ovádi and Orosz 2009). Because these aggregates display the ultrastructural and tinctorial properties of amyloid (i.e., ~10-nm-wide fibrils with crossed β-pleated sheet structures), these disorders can be grouped together as brain amyloidoses (see Forman et al. 2004; Skovronsky et al. 2006). A causative link between the formation of protein aggregates and ND has been established, which may occur as a result of the toxic action of substances produced during early phases, and soluble oligomers and protofibrillar derivatives of misfolded proteins may play a pathogenic role (Catalano et al. 2006; Csizmók and Tompa 2009; Gong et al. 2003; Haass and Selkoe 2007; Hu et al. 2008; Irvine et al. 2008; Israeli and Sharon 2009; Kokubo et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2006; Resende et al. 2008; Rowan et al. 2007; Salminen et al. 2008; Selkoe 2008; Simoneau et al. 2007; Skovronsky et al. 2006; Soto and Estrada 2008; Standridge 2006; Tomiyama et al. 2008). Oligomers and pre-aggregated proteins probably form intracellularly (Takashima 2008). The “toxic oligomer” hypothesis is supported by the finding that a single-domain antibody can recognize a common conformational epitope that is displayed by several disease-associated proteins, including β-amyloid (Aβ), α-synuclein (αSyn), tau protein, prions, and polyglutamine (polyQ) containing peptides (Hernandez and Avila 2008; Kayed et al. 2003; Lafaye et al. 2009; Moore et al. 2009; Truant et al. 2008; Williams and Paulson 2008) (Fig. 2).

αSyn assembles into highly soluble special oligomers that proceed to insoluble aggregates (Sharon et al. 2003); it is potentially prone to misfold (Uversky 2007) and may lead to neuronal death (Kazantsev and Kolchinsky 2008), but also other modes of toxicity have been proposed (Waxman and Giasson 2008). The lysosomal protease cathepsin D influences αSyn processing, aggregation, and toxicity in vivo (Cullen et al. 2009). Recently, elevated levels of soluble αSyn oligomers have been detected in postmortem brains of DLB patients (Paleologou et al. 2009) and methods to detect morphologically distinct oligomeric forms of αSyn have been described (Emadi et al. 2009).

Aβ oligomers are increased in AD in both brain tissue and plasma (Xia et al. 2009). There is a growing body of evidence that Aβ aggregates are ordered oligomers and the cause rather than a product of AD. The analysis of the assembly pathway of Aβ in vitro and biochemical

characterization of Aβ deposits isolated from AD brains indicate that Aβ oligomerization occurs via distinct intermediates, including oligomers of 3–50 Aβ monomers, annular oligomers, protofibrils, fibrils and plaques. Of these, the most toxic species appear to be small Aβ oligomers (Finder and Glockshuber 2007). They affect the postsynaptic region and hippocampal synaptic plasticity (Dinamarca et al. 2008), and their synaptic accumulation correlates with synaptic loss (Deshpande et al. 2009). Presynaptic injection of Aβ blocks synaptic transmission (Moreno et al. 2009), while postsynaptic APP has recently been shown to enhance N-methyl D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors (Hoe et al. 2009). Accumulation of caspase cleaved APP represents an early neurodegenerative event in aging and AD (Zhao et al. 2003). Increased Aβ production and/or aggregation may lead to abnormal activity of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) and likely contributes to progression of AD (Vintem et al. 2009), while suppression of Aβ deposition leads to long-term reduction of AD pathology in Tg2576 mice (Karlonski et al. 2009). ApoE4 and Aβ aggregates were found to act synergistically to induce neurodegeneration in the mouse brain (Belinson et al. 2008), whereas Aβ accumulation induced by mutant APP did not (Muller et al. 2008). Autoantibodies against Aβ are common in AD brain and help control the plaque burden (Kellner et al. 2009). The fraction of the soluble, mainly toxic Aβ pool is intracellular (Steinerman et al. 2008) and is recognized and targeted by conformation-sensitive antibodies (Meli et al. 2009). Lipid surfaces promote aggregation of Aβ proteins and the permeability changes that these aggregates induce on lipid membranes (Relini et al. 2009), but there is a dynamic relationship

between intra- and extracellular pools of Aβ (Oddo et al. 2006). Prion protein (PrP) is one of the main cellular receptors for oligomeric Aβ (Lauren et al. 2009). The structure of a soluble Aβ-peptide oligomer has recently been characterized (Yu et al. 2009a) and cell culture studies with recombinant-derived or chemically synthesized Aβ have contributed to a better understanding of Aβ oligomerization (Bharadwaj et al. 2009). Solid-state NMR data indicate that the predominant molecular structure of in brain seeded Aβ fibrils differs from that of purely synthetic Aβ-40 fibrils, which probably allows a new approach to detailed structural characterization of Aβ fibrils and their possible correlation with neurodegeneration in AD (Paravastu et al. 2009).

Oligomeric and pre-aggregated forms of tau protein have been shown to be toxic in vitro (Khlistunova et al. 2006), but the mechanisms underlying its structural changes leading to human tauopathies still remain elusive (Brunden et al. 2008; Sahara et al. 2008). Transgenic overexpression of ApoE4 in neurons but not in astrocytes increases tau phosphorylation in mice (Brech et al. 2004), suggesting a neuron-specific effect of ApoE4 on tau phosphorylation. The pathophysiologic significance of this pathway is not clear. The natively unfolded character of tau and its aggregation to Alzheimer-like paired helical filaments have been discussed (Jeganathan et al. 2008). Serum amyloid component P (SAP) is always present in CSF, in cerebrovascular and intracerebral Aβ plaques and NFTs, and, as a result of its binding to amyloid fibrils and to paired helical filaments, respectively, it may be directly neurocytotoxic. Its structure and its likely ligand on hyperphosphorylated tau have been solved recently, but the

effects of SAP depletion in AD and other NDDs need further elucidation (Kolstoe et al. 2009). In polyQ diseases, the protein context of expanded polyQ and its soluble mutant conformers are critical for the disease specificity (Truant et al. 2008). Structural and dynamic aspects related to oligomerization of SOD1 and its mutants have provided better insight into SOD1 pathway in relation to fALS (Banci et al. 2008, 2009).

The fact that the transient oligomers disappear at the same rate that fibrils appear suggests that these may be assembled directly from them via a longitudinal association of the oligomers (Fink 2006).

In general, the identity of the underlying protein determines which neurons are affected and, hence, the clinical manifestation of each disease (Kovacs and Budka 2009). However, the same process of ND and the same mutation in the genes encoding protein constituents of these aggregates may be associated with a variety of clinico-pathological phenotypes, whereas similar or identical phenotypes may be related to different genetic defects. Increasing evidence supports the notion that abnormal protein–protein interactions and/or the lesions that result from them trigger vicious circles leading to dysfunction and death of neuronal and glial cells with ensuing disintegration of neuronal networks (Palop et al. 2006; Seeley et al. 2009). Abnormal interaction between normal, highly soluble brain proteins alters their conformation, and misfolding gradually converts them into insoluble polymers with the aggregates adopting either highly ordered (characteristic cross-pleated β-sheet structures) or disordered (amorphous) forms. For example, self-propagating protein structures that can be transmitted between cells and

Protein folding and misfolding

Proteins are a heterogeneous population of different long-lived conformers which, due to their flexibility, are in a dynamic state between various conformational substrates maintained by synthesis and degradation (Schwartz and Ciechanover 2009). Folding is part of the normal process that converts newly synthesized proteins to physiologically functional molecules. This process is controlled by molecular chaperones that facilitate normal folding, prevent inappropriate interaction between non-native polypeptides, and promote the refolding of proteins that have become misfolded as a result of cellular stress (see Muchowski and Wacker 2005). The transformation of normal proteins into pathological conformers is predicted to result in losses of functions culminating in death of affected cells. The pathogenic pathways involve membrane permeabilization through a channel mechanism or hydrophobic interaction of prefibrillary oligomers with various cellular targets (Dimakopoulos 2005). Aberrant proteins, the result of production errors, inherited or acquired amino
acid substitutions or damage, especially oxidative modifications, often cannot fold correctly and will be trapped in misfolded conformations. To get rid of the cell of misfolded proteins, the living cell contains a large number of intracellular proteases, which, together with the chaperones, comprise the cellular protein quality-control systems in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Scheper and Hoozemans 2009). The two principal routes of intracellular protein catabolism are the ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS) and the autophagy–lysosome pathway (ALP) (autophagy). Both were implicated to play important roles in the pathogenesis of NDDs (McCray and Taylor 2008), but also to collaborate in neuroprotection (Nedelsky et al. 2008). Many inherited disorders due to amino acid substitutions exhibit loss-of-function (LOF) pathogenesis because the aberrant protein is eliminated by one of the control systems. However, not all aberrant proteins can be eliminated and the misfolded protein may accumulate and form toxic oligomeric and/or aggregated inclusions. In this case, the loss of function may be accompanied by a gain-of-function (GOF) pathogenesis, which in many cases determines the pathological and clinical features (Agnati et al. 2008; Winklhofer et al. 2008). In AD there is no consensus as yet whether the disease acts through a LOF or GOF mechanism. Although gain of toxic function by Aβ still remains a favorite hypothesis, AD occurring by an Aβ-independent LOF mechanism is gaining attention. One of the consequences of the LOF of (mutant) PSEN impacts amyloidosis by which total Aβ or abundantly secreted Aβ-40 isoform is reduced. This was shown in cellular models (Kumar-Singh et al. 2006) and in mouse models when increased levels of Aβ-40 in brain while keeping the Aβ-42 level decreased plaque burden (Kim et al. 2007). On the other hand, larger protein aggregates may be inactive or even represent an inherent protective or defensive mechanism by sequestering or inactivating toxic oligomers and protofibrils (Gispert-Sanchez and Auburger2006; Gregersen 2006). Thus, the “abnormal protein–protein interaction” or “fatal attractions” hypothesis describes plausible unifying mechanisms to account for the onset and progression of neurodegenerative proteinopathies.

Many diseases of protein homeostasis, or “proteostasis,” caused by the misregulation of protein maintenance, include LOF and gain-of-toxic-function diseases (AD, PD, HD). Proteostasis is maintained by the proteostasis network, which comprises pathways that control protein synthesis, folding, trafficking, aggregation, disaggregation, and degradation. The decreased ability of the proteostasis network to cope with inherited misfolding-prone proteins, aging, and/or metabolic/environmental stress appears to trigger or exacerbate proteostasis diseases. There is recent evidence supporting the principle that proteostasis is influenced both by an adjustable proteostasis network capacity and protein folding energetics, which together determine the balance between folding efficiency, misfolding, protein degradation, and aggregation. Small molecules can enhance proteostasis by binding to and stabilizing specific proteins (chaperones) or by increasing the proteostasis network capacity (proteostasis regulators) (Powers et al. 2009). The consequences of an imbalance in homeostasis on the flux of misfolded proteins, if unattended, can result in severe molecular damage to the cell. Adaptation and survival requires the ability to sense damaged proteins and to coordinate the activities of protective stress response pathways and chaperone networks. Yet, despite the abundance and apparent capacity of chaperones and other components of homeostasis to restore folding equilibrium, the cell appears poorly adapted for chronic proteotoxic stress when conformationally challenged aggregation-prone proteins are expressed in cancer, metabolic disease, and NDD. The decline in biosynthetic and repair activities that compromises the integrity of the proteome is influenced strongly by genes that control aging, thus linking stress and protein homeostasis with the health and life span of the organism (Morimoto 2008).

Many proteins associated with NDDs are intrinsically disordered under physiological conditions (Eliezer 2009b; Uversky 2009). Protein aggregation occurs in vivo as a result of improper folding or misfolding leading to a change in the secondary and/or tertiary structure of a normal, functional protein, inducing the formation of protein aggregates with various supramolecular organizations. The resulting aggregates are largely independent of the conformational properties of their soluble precursors (Calamai et al. 2005). The crucial feature of the amyloidogenic proteins is their structural instability induced either by mutations, posttranslational modifications, local conditions, environmental factors or other molecular mechanisms, such as changes in redox state or transglutaminase-mediated protein cross-linking. Progressive intracellular protein accumulation can result from various pathological processes: (a) abnormal synthesis and folding, (b) abnormal interaction with other proteins, (c) overproduction of protein constituents, (d) impaired degradation and turnover, (e) altered posttranslational modifications of newly synthesized proteins, (f) abnormal proteolytic cleavage, (g) improper expression or altered gene splicing, (h) insufficient molecular chaperone activity, (i) impaired intracellular transport of proteins, and (j) protein folding and misfolding may be modified on surfaces (Stefani 2008). The first mechanisms have been the subject of intense investigations, but less attention has been focused on the role of the axonal transport in NDDs (Chevalier-Larsen and Holzbaur 2006; De Vos et al. 2008; Roy et al. 2005). Causes are genetic deficits producing a single amino acid substantiation or expansion of a repeating amino acid tract, as
occurs in familial diseases. However, for most NDDs that occur sporadically or in non-Mendelian familial fashion, other factors may induce the pathogenic cascade.

### Protein misfolding and endoplasmic reticulum stress

The conformational change may promote diseases either by gain of toxic activity or by the lack of biological function of the natively folded protein under adverse conditions, including OS, protein misfolding during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and aging by accumulation of damaged proteins in the cell. Recent advances have provided insight into the detection and characterization of misfolded protein conformations and have identified critically involved intracellular nanomachines and/or multi-component complexes (Lee et al. 2006; Lyubchenko et al. 2006; Rubinsztein 2006). The ER response is characterized by changes in specific proteins, causing translational attenuation, induction of ER chaperones, and degradation of misfolded proteins, while in prolonged or aggravated ER stress, cellular signals leading to cell death are activated. ER stress has been suggested to be involved in some human neuronal diseases, such as AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), prion diseases, etc. (Malhotra and Kaufman 2007). The exact contributions to and causal effects of ER stress and the proteins involved, however, are poorly understood (Lindholm et al. 2006).

The mechanism by which αSyn, tau, and Aβ protein make fibrils is an example of conformational plasticity, because these polypeptides can visit a coil or helical structure, but otherwise they convert into a pathogenic β-sheet structure highly suitable for polymerization and fiber formation (Cairns et al. 2004; Cookson and van der Brug 2008; Giasson et al. 2003; Uversky 2007). Misfolding of αSyn, which is involved in vesicular turnover, synaptic function, neuronal plasticity response, regulation of certain enzymes, transporters and neurotransmitter vesicles, neuronal survival, and can act as molecular chaperone, may be a critical factor of synucleinopathies (Gentile et al. 2008; Uversky 2008). Both conformational folding of previously unfolded tau protein and cleavage causing aggregation lead to neuronal dysfunction by interference with axonal transport, neurotoxicity of early aggregated state (before fibril formation and after hyperphosphorylation), contributing to disruption of neuronal circuits due to synapse loss and eventual cell death (Chun and Johnson 2007; Mondragon-Rodriguez et al. 2009; Spires-Jones et al. 2009; Takashima 2008). Both extracellular tau and prion aggregates can transmit a misfolded state from the outside to the inside of a cell. The intracellular fibrils can seed fibril formation of recombinant tau monomers in vitro, indicating propagation of protein misfolding from the outside to the inside of cells (Frost et al. 2009).

The role that polyQ-induced aggregates, e.g., in HD, plays in disease is not yet fully determined (Hatters 2008). N-terminal mutant huntingtin (mhtt) proteins activate cellular pathways linked to ER stress, and that inhibition of ER stress by salubrinal increases cell survival. The data suggests that compounds targeting ER stress may be considered in designing novel approaches for treatment of HD and possibly other polyQ diseases (Reijonen et al. 2008).

In vivo, these changes develop insidiously over the lifetime of an individual, even though they usually do not manifest clinically until middle or late life. The causes of this prolonged process due to progressive damage of specific vulnerable brain regions or neuronal networks before clinical manifestation are poorly understood (Palop et al. 2006). Some factors may be unfavorable kinetics of protein misfolding, oligomerization, and fibrillation, that are linked to age-related metabolic impairments. A key unanswered question is whether these aggregates contribute to the onset and progression of ND are mere bystanders resulting from an alternative pathway, or even may be a neuroprotective response (Jellinger 2007b; Schulz 2008; Woulfe 2007). Although mutations in the genes encoding the fibrillizing proteins segregate familial forms of the corresponding diseases, the same brain lesions also can be formed by the corresponding wild-type protein in a sporadic form of the disease, and fibrils and inclusion bodies are not the only causal agents. Accumulating evidence suggests that fibrils or inclusions may not be toxic, but rather represent a nonfunctional state, albeit inseparable from the disease process or even reflect the presence of an inherent detoxifying mechanism that “entraps” potential injurious endogenous products into “quiescent” aggregates (Gregersen 2006). It becomes more apparent that the pathology of AD and other proteinopathies represents effect rather than cause, or at least a host response to injury equaling neuroprotection (Castellani et al. 2008; Castellani et al. 2009).

#### Unfolded protein response

Alterations in cellular homeostasis that affect protein folding in the ER trigger a signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR). Initially cytoprotective, it will trigger an apoptotic cascade if the cellular insult is not corrected. ER stress is caused by disturbances in its structure and function with accumulation of misfolded proteins and alterations in calcium homeostasis (Wojda et al. 2008). During aging and in NDDs, cellular Ca²⁺-regulating systems are compromised resulting in synaptic dysfunction, impaired plasticity and ND. OS, perturbed energy metabolism, and aggregation of disease-related proteins adversely affect Ca²⁺ homeostasis by mechanisms that have been elucidated recently (Marambaud et al. 2009;

Mattson 2007). Recent data show that the UPR is activated in pretangle neurons in AD hippocampus (Hoozemans et al. 2009) and increased levels of several molecular chaperones in cytologically normal appearing neurons suggest an early role for the UPR (Macario and Conway de Macario 2007). Although its initial participation in AD pathogenesis might be neuroprotective, its sustained activation might initiate or mediate ND (Hoozemans and Scheper 2009). There is no evidence of the UPR in neuropathic models of Gaucher disease (Farfel-Becker et al. 2009). Overexpression of ubiquilin 1 during ER stress exerts a protective effect during the UPR by attenuation induction of C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) and potentially increases cell viability (Lu et al. 2009).

Proteins that remain unfolded are degraded not only by the UPS, and the phagosome–lysosome system (Tai and Schuman 2008) or autophagy with three major pathways: chaperone-mediated autophagy (CMA), micro- and macro-autophagy (Todde et al. 2009) (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in some cases, protein aggregates are formed in otherwise healthy neurons, and their presence is not correlated with clinical symptoms. “Misfolding” may also result in altering the normal function of proteins, e.g., physiological proteins (Csizmák and Tompa 2009). Therefore, fibrils may be inactive endproducts of a common pathogenic cascade of an otherwise deleterious process, but, in general, detection of fibrillar assemblies indicates that neurons have been exposed to a wide array of noxious agents.

### Molecular composition of inclusions

Despite differences in the molecular composition of these filamentous lesions, the brain regions and cell types they affect, growing evidence supports the notion that they engage common downstream pathogenic targets. Although the different localizations of hallmark protein aggregations [extracellular Aβ deposits in AD, cytoplasmic Lewy bodies (LBs) in PD, TDP-43 intracytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusions in AD, FTLD, ALS, intranuclear inclusions in HD] may suggest that each protein strikes a single cellular domain. However, recent studies suggest the possibility of common pathogenesis. In addition to showing common morphological and chemical features, the inclusion bodies co-localize with several other proteins that are not structural elements of abnormal fibers, but are binding to them, including various hallmark chaperones and components of the UPS protein implicated in cellular responses, associated with signal transduction, cytoskeletal, cell cycle, and other proteins (Inoue et al. 2009; Sherman and Goldberg 2001). Proteomic analysis of cortical LBs revealed 296 proteins, related to multiple or unknown functions (Leverenz et al. 2007), while in brainstem LBs 90 proteins were identified, differing from Pick bodies and suggesting a complex

formation process (Burns et al. 2008). In vivo protein aggregation exhibits a remarkable specificity, suggesting that conserved mechanisms underlie it depending on selective interactions and result in the formation of fibrillary structures (Morell et al. 2008). This might reflect an irreversible sequestration and subsequent loss of functions and/or a failed attempt to refold and degrade aggregated proteins.

The cellular response to these aggregates includes (1) the recruitment of chaperones or proteins involved in the folding of nascent translational products and in the resolution of aggregated polypeptides, and (2) the ubiquitination of aggregates, suggesting cellular attempts to degrade deposits of these mutant proteins via the UPS (Tai and Schuman 2008). Ubiquitination of proteins in inclusions may also be part of a signal transduction mechanism in afflicted neurons and do not reflect abortive proteolysis (Layfield et al. 2003). It has been accepted that misfolding and deposition impairs a gain of function that ultimately leads to neuronal death (Hardy and Selkoe 2002), although there are opponents who challenge this dogma (Lee et al. 2004).

The frequent co-occurrence of both AD and PD and of inclusions characteristic of both disorders in several other NDDs suggests the involvement of a common underlying aberrant process. It can be surmised that oxidative/nitrative stress, which is cooperatively influenced by environmental factors, genetic predisposition, and senescence, may be a link between these disorders (Giasson et al. 2002). This collision of two processes may occur in the same brain region or even within single cells in the human brain, e.g., in LRRK2 mutations (Giasson et al. 2006), in tg mice, and in rare familial forms of DLB (Clarimon et al. 2009). A direct link between hyperphosphorylated tau and synaptic pathology is also supported by accumulation of abnormally phosphorylated tau and αSyn within synaptic terminals in AD brains and APP Swedish mutant tg mice (Muntane et al. 2008; Takahashi et al. 2008). Induction of hyperphosphorylation of tau by αSyn in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) model of parkinsonism (Duka et al. 2006), and the co-location of phospho-tau and αSyn in both NFTs and LBs (Ishizawa et al. 2003; Shao et al. 2006) and the co-occurrence of abnormal deposition of tau, αSyn and TDP-43 in AD, DLB and other NDDs, probably related to genetic factors (Arai et al. 2009; Higashi et al. 2007), highlight the interface between these two and other misfolded proteins (Soto and Estrada 2008). Others have suggested that amyloid rather than tau enhances αSyn pathology in human brain and tg mice (Pletnikova et al. 2005). Accumulation of Aβ and phospho-tau are thought to be coexistent, Aβ initiating hyperphosphorylation of tau (Huang and Jiang 2009). In a “dual pathway” of causality, Aβ and tau can be linked by
separate mechanisms driven by common upstream driver (Small and Duff 2008). The senile plaque, where Aβ and tau meet, could be an important site of interaction: the cytoplasmic domain of APP, phosphorylated on threonine 668, could be the intermediate, since it appears to be associated with both tau and Aβ (Shin et al. 2008). Interactions between Aβ, αSyn and tau may be a molecular mechanism in overlapping pathology of AD and PD/DLB (Mandal et al. 2006; Obi et al. 2008), probably generated by the same stimulus with the outcome possibly having an inverse relationship depending on genetic background or possibly environmental factors (Fujishiro et al. 2008; Jellinger 2007b). Although recent data further documented co-localization of Aβ and phospho-tau in synaptosomes (Fein et al. 2008), why tau and Aβ pathologies are so intimately associated, remains one of the major unresolved questions of AD pathophysiology. TDP-43 proteinopathies are distinct from most other NDDs because they are due to protein misfolding without amyloidosis, while TDP-43-positive inclusions show abnormal hyperphosphorylation, ubiquitination and C-terminal fragments (Kwong et al. 2008). It is unclear, whether there is a common underlying pathogenic mechanism inducing both ND and fibrillary protein aggregates that are typical for different disease processes (double or triple amyloidosis) or if they represent a common final pathology leading to ND.

The ubiquitin–proteasomal system (UPS)

All cellular components are subjected to continuous surveillance by intracellular control systems. The UPS, the major non-lysosomal system for regulating protein turnover, and the autophagy–lysosome pathway (ALP) are the two most important mechanisms for regulating protein handling (Layfield and Mayer 2008; Thompson et al. 2008; van Tijn et al. 2008). These protein quality control systems in the ER are important in the pathogenesis of NDDs (Scheper and Hoozemans 2009). The presence of ubiquitinated proteins within neuronal inclusions is one of the hallmarks of ND (Table 2). These inclusions contain various components of the UPS which operates as an intra-cellular protein-clearing system (Rubinsztein 2006; Schwartz and Ciechanover 2009; Tai and Schuman 2008). It consists of a multienzymatic pathway placed mainly in the ER which becomes activated during OS and works to process misfolded protein-mediating reactions that link abnormal proteins with multiple Ub molecules as a signal for degradation domains and may promote their degradation. Ubiquitination is a multi-step process (Fig. 4). Mono-Ub and Ub dimers may regulate the enzymatic functions of UB carboxy terminal hydrolase (UCH)-L1 and UCH-L3, two of the deubiquitinating enzymes expressed in the brain, in vivo (Setsuie et al. 2009). More recently, a family of

Ub-like modifiers known as SUMO 1-4 (small Ub-like modifier) have been described. Through a process similar to monoubiquitination termed sumoylation, SUMO monomers are conjugated to target proteins. In some cases monoubiquitination or sumoylation may act to protect proteins from Ub-dependent degradation (Kim et al. 2008) and in other cases they appear to trigger polyubiquitination. Sumoylation and monoubiquitination at one or two lysines within a target protein may also alter the subcellular location of the protein (Mosesson et al. 2003). Monoubiquitination of membrane proteins may trigger their cytoplasmic internalization. Monoubiquitination of the p53 tumor suppressor protein causes it to be transported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm by multifaceted effects of SUMO (Stehmeier and Muller 2009).

The UPS is active in distinct nuclear domains and plays a major role controlling the initial steps of gene expression, DNA repair, nuclear quality-control mechanisms, and cell cycle control (Reed 2006). A tuned balance of ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of nuclear proteins is instrumental in nuclear function and, when deregulated, leads to ND. It is essential for the nonlysosomal degradation and clearance of short-lived, mislocated, mutant, misfold, and damaged—e.g., by oxidative injury—proteins that have the potential to induce cellular damage (Pickart 2001; Voss and Grune 2007). Proteasome regulators (activators and inhibitors) have been reviewed recently (Huang and Chen 2009). Unconventional poly-Ub chains are critical for UPS function (Xu et al. 2009), and Ub plays an important role in the clearance of nonfunctional RNAs (Fujii et al. 2009). Proteasomal dysfunction may be caused by misexpression of one or more of its subunits. Aggregated proteins are relatively refractory to degradation, and are therefore transported to perinuclear microtubule-organizing centers (centrosomes), where they are encapsulated by intermediary filaments to form large structures called aggresomes, sites of enhanced proteolysis, serving to protect from exposure to cytotoxic effects of abnormal proteins (Hirsch et al. 2009). This protection depends on the Ub-binding domains and may promote degradation of ubiquitinated proteins (Hartmann-Petersen et al. 2003). The UPS becomes abnormally activated also during abnormal protein cleavage, and altered or inappropriate gene splicing. In these conditions, it may not be able to degrade damaged proteins producing their aggregation in the cell and ultimately causing neuronal dysfunction (Fig. 3). A reduction in its efficacy increases the storage of aggregation-prone proteins and could explain the accumulation of Ub and substrates in diseased neurons, which disrupt normal cell activity (Bedford et al. 2008b; Salomons et al. 2009; Tai and Schuman 2008). The accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER results in a highly specific UPS which, when activated, leads to either

a reduction in ER stress or apoptotic cell death. However, ubiquitination of protein substrates without proteolysis and proteasome-independent function of Ub in endocytosis and signaling (Mukhopadhyay and Riezman 2007), and Ub-independent degradation of proteins by the proteasome (Jariel-Encontre et al. 2008) have been described, unveiling potential new regulatory functions. Thus, derangements in the Ub could potentially lead to alterations in processes that are unrelated to protein degradation. The UPS appears to be at the intersection of whether a toxic protein is degraded or whether it is packed into an inclusion which may be one of the strategies of the cell to process damaged and/or mutated potentially toxic proteins and that, given a chance, the cell will recover from such stress. Ubiquitination has a central role in signal transduction to rival and complement protein phosphorylation (Welchman et al. 2005) and synaptic plasticity (Hegde 2004), while Ub-binding domains (UBD) are relevant to the DNA damage response, acting to restore normal transcription after DNA damage (Daulnyand Tansey 2009; Hofmann 2009). Transmembrane proteins at the ER can be degraded by the proteasome, which is assisted by multiple chaperones (Nakatsukasa et al. 2008), but Ub conjugation is not required for the degradation of oxidated proteins by the proteasome (Shringarpure et al. 2003). Under conditions of proteolytic stress, the cell may switch to a non-proteolytic form of ubiquitination to help divert misfolded proteins away from an overloaded proteasome. In this way, the cell could preserve its proteasomal functions over prolonged periods of stress and recover thereafter (Wong et al. 2009). However, various factors can result in the cell’s defense machinery becoming overwhelmed such that inspite of aggregates/inclusions cytotoxic species are formed, or cell stresses may have a direct effect on this protein-handling system (Gregersen 2006). These expanded proteins are resistant to proteolysis by the UPS, and the lack of its efficacy may be responsible for accumulating expanded proteins within affected cells, leading to neuronal inclusions. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates provide a nuclear center for the formation of inclusion bodies, but there are several differences that distinguish these inclusions, some being aggregated in the cytoplasm, others are prevalent in the nucleus (Bennett et al. 2005; Woulfe 2007). Differential activities of the UPS in neurons (lower) versus glia may account for the preferential accumulation of misfolded proteins (Tydlacka et al. 2008).

Autophagy and neurodegeneration (ND)

Another pathway for cytosolic protein clearance through lysosomes is CMA (Galluzzi et al. 2008), involved in the degradation of proteins and organelles, cellular remodeling, etc. Model systems in increasing numbers are now

Recent advances in our understanding of neurodegeneration

available to study the role of autophagy in the CNS and how it might be exploited to treat disease (Jaeger and Wyss-Coray 2009). Proteins are transferred to the lysosomal membrane and, through binding to a receptor lysosome-associated membrane protein (autophagosome), they are translocated into the lysosomal lumen and degraded (Eskelinen and Saftig 2009) (Fig. 5). The molecular mechanism involved in the three autophagic pathways: chaperone mediated autophagy (CMA), micro- and macro-autophagy, and their relevance in ND have been reviewed recently (Boland et al. 2008; Cherra and Chu 2008; Deretic 2008; Levine and Kroemer 2008; Shacka et al. 2008; Todde et al. 2009). Dysregulation of macroautophagy has been implicated in synaptic dysfunction, cellular stress, and neuronal cell death (Chu et al. 2009), while the process, known as microautophagy, is poorly understood (Rubinsztein 2006). Autophagy, a cytosolic, non-specific bulk degradation system, is an important clearance route for many cytosolic, aggregate-prone proteins, like mhtt and mutant αSyn. 1-Methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+) impairs autophagic clearance of αSyn by impeding the activity of dynein that is considered to play an important role in the autophagic clearance of aggregate-prone proteins (Cai et al. 2009). Induction of autophagy enhances the clearance of both soluble and aggregated forms of the mutant proteins, and protects against toxicity caused by these mutants (Ravikumar et al. 2008). Tissue-specific impairment of autophagy in CNS tissue causes massive loss of neurons resulting in ND (Uchiyama et al. 2008). Emerging evidence supports the view that induction of autophagy is a neuroprotective process and that inadequate or defective autophagy, rather than excessive autophagy, compromises degradation of UPS substrates and, thus, promotes cell death (Korolchuk et al. 2009; Nixon 2006). However, how autophagy protects cells from damage leading to ND is not yet clear (Tooze and Schiavo 2008).

UPS in neurodegenerative disorders

Aberrant UPS function has been reported in multiple neuropathologies, including ND and ischemia (Thompson et al. 2008). Both in vivo and in vitro experimental models are available to study NDDs which feature cellular inclusions allowing to make inferences on their pathogenesis (Fornai et al. 2005). Dysregulation of the UPS appears to be both a cause and a result of NDDs.

Ub immunohistochemistry is of particular interest in diagnostic neuropathology. This small stress-induced protein is found in various inclusions of NDDs, and the Ub-binding protein 62/sequestosome 1, a cytosolic 62-kd protein (p62) is also a common component of various inclusions (Kuusisto et al. 2008; Wooten et al. 2006). The formation of inclusions follows a certain kind of “maturation” pathway and involves ubiquitination only later (Bancher et al. 1989; Kuusisto et al. 2003).

While dysfunction of the UPS has already been implicated in the pathogenesis of PD (Lim 2007), the demonstration that αSyn is degraded by both proteasome and autophagy indicates a possible linkage between the UPS and ALP, and the fact that mutated αSyn inhibits ALP functioning by binding to the receptor on the lysosomal membrane for autophagy pathway further supports the

Fig. 5 Autophagy-lysosomal pathways via endocytosis and endoautophagic mechanisms. Lysosomes are organelles that contain acid hydrolases that break biomolecules. Endocytosed proteins first arrive early and later recycling endosomes, while hydrolases provide dual safeguards. Intracellular proteins can enter lysosomes through autophagic mechanisms, either micro- or macro-autophagy, or are unfolded in chaperone-mediated autophagy (modified from Tai and Schuman 2008)

assumption that the ALP may be related to the development of PD (Pan et al. 2008; Engelender 2008).

LBs, the morphological hallmark of PD and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), have a distinct central parkin and Ub-positive domain, with αSyn in the periphery (Olanow and McNaught 2006), but it is incorporated into LBs and dystrophic neurites before ubiquitination (Eliezer 2009a; Sampathu et al. 2003). Co-localization of αSyn and parkin within LBs suggests that parkin plays a role in ubiquitination and posttranslational modification of αSyn (Schlossmacher et al. 2002). The latter results in changes of protein size, structure or charge (Beyer 2006), e.g., phosphorylation and nitration, both enhancing fibrillation and formation of LBs (Hodara et al. 2004; Smith et al. 2005). There is conflicting evidence concerning the pathogenesis of αSyn aggregation. It is mono- and polyubiquitinated by E3 Ub ligase Siah-1, which reportedly promotes αSyn aggregation and its toxicity (Lee et al. 2008). A functional Ubi-3-ligase complex consisting of early-onset familial PD associated Parkin, PINK-1 (also known as PARK-6) and DJ-1 (PARK-7) mutations promotes degradation of un- or mis-folded proteins and may constitute a pathogenic mechanism for recessive forms of inherited PD (Li and Guo 2009; Xiong et al. 2009). Full-length leucine-rich repeat kinase 2 (LRRK2), that regulates synaptic vesicle endocytosis (Shin et al. 2008), is not a major component of LBs and of tau inclusions, but truncated forms may account for LRRK2 immunoreactivity in distinct intraneural inclusions (Santpere and Ferrer 2009a).

The presence of ubiquitinating and proteolytic enzymes and other cytoskeletal elements in LBs indicates that these inclusions could be specialized aggresome-related structures as a means of controlling excessive levels of abnormal proteins (Chen and Feany 2005). While the activities of proteasome peptides in striatum are preserved in PD, but reduced in multiple system atrophy (MSA) (Furukawa et al. 2002), proteasome activator PA 28 is low in substantia nigra (SN) of PD brain, suggesting that failure in the UPS to degrade unwanted proteins may underlie its degeneration (Maynard et al. 2005). In a genetic mouse model of PD, 26S proteasomal dysfunction in SN neurons triggers ND of the nigrostriatal pathway, and intraneuronal Lewy-like inclusions containing αSyn and Ub in surviving neurons show mitochondria similar to those in early forms of LBs (pale bodies) in PD patients. This demonstrates a direct link between dysfunction of the UPS and the neuropathology of PD and that 26S proteasome activity may maintain neuronal homeostasis (Bedford et al. 2008a). Elevated cytoplasmic dopamine is another main feature underlying the early stage of αSyn-mediated ND (Park et al. 2007).

In AD, Aβ inhibits the proteasome and enhances amyloid and tau accumulation (Oddo 2008; Tseng et al. 2008), while ionic liquids promote amyloid formation from αSyn (Hwang et al. 2009). ATPase subunit 6b (S6b) transcript upregulation may be related to tauopathies, while in synucleinopathies it appears not to be involved (Zouambia et al. 2008).

The importance of the UPS has been observed also in other NDDs, e.g., in HD characterized by striatal degeneration with nuclear inclusions of the truncated ubiquitinated protein huntingtin, chaperones, and proteasomes, where protein quality control regulates polyQ-induced toxicity (Finkbeiner and Mitra 2008; Gil and Rego 2008;
Wang et al. 2008; Williams and Paulson 2008). HD is linked to global changes in the UPS to a much greater extent than previously recognized, but the global status of the system in HD brain is not yet fully elucidated (Bennett et al. 2007; Ortega et al. 2007). In neuronal cells, polyglutamine protein inclusions are present predominantly in the nucleus, which is not accessible to autophagy. It remains unclear how the UP and autophagy pathways remove misfolded proteins in the different subcellular regions of neurons, where disease proteins become misfolded and aggregated in an age-dependent manner (Li et al. 2008). Intracellular degradation of polyQ aggregates by the UPS is triggered by some nuclear Ub ligases (Iwata et al. 2009), and in inclusion bodies are suggested to have a protective cellular response to mhtt mediated in part by improving intracellular protein degradation related to impairment of UPS dynamics (Mitra et al. 2009).

Dysfunction of the UPS is also important in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) showing skein-like inclusions in motor neurons rich in Ub proteasome and some chaperone proteins (Seilhean et al. 2004), in spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs), with neuronal intranuclear inclusions containing ataxin-1 and several chaperones (Davies et al. 2007), and neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease [for rev. see (Jellinger 2007a)]. However, despite the notion that inclusions might be protective, involved neurons ultimately fail to compensate for the abnormal and/or toxic protein accumulation and, finally, die. While inhibition of the UPS might be expected to worsen most NDDs, its augmentation possesses unique challenges, such as delivery of its components to the nervous system or identification of drugs that enhance the degradation of toxic proteins without compromising normal UPS function (Tai and Schuman 2008).

### Aggresomes

When the capacity of the proteasome system to degrade misfolded proteins is overwhelmed, aggregation occurs and proteins are moved to a Ub-rich structure termed the “aggresome” as a general response to discrepancies in protein turnover (Olzmann et al. 2008). It forms part of the cellular response to aggregated proteins and appears as inclusions in a number of proteinopathies. Aggresomes have been reported for superoxide dismutase (SOD) (Son et al. 2003), parkin (Muqit et al. 2004), αSyn (Eliezer 2009a), and prion proteins (Mishra et al. 2003), the formation of which has been associated with activation of caspases and apoptosis (Kristiansen et al. 2005). However, it is not clear whether aggresome formation is causative or protective, although data suggested that they serve a cytoprotective function, facilitating the degradation of toxic proteins (Taylor et al. 2003). The Ub ligase E6-AP is recruited to aggresomes in response to proteasome inhibition and may be involved in the ubiquitination of Hsp70-bound misfolded proteins (Mishra et al. 2009). Misregulation of degradation of misfolded proteins leads to their accumulation with inhibition of axonal transport, thus facilitating the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins in the cell body and cell dysfunction. This interaction may involve (1) a loss of function, (2) a gain of function, or (3) an inflammatory stimulus (Schwab and McGeer 2008). Nevertheless, there is still considerable debate as to whether the deposits are a cause or function of the disease (see Fornai et al. 2005).

#### Oxidative stress and formation of free radicals

Oxidative stress (OS) occurs when the production of free radicals or their products are in excess of antioxidant defense mechanisms (Sayre et al. 2008). Resulting from increased formation of hydrogen peroxide and oxygen-derived free radicals, it can damage biological molecules and initiate a cascade of events, including dysfunction of mitochondrial respiration, excitotoxicity, and a fatal rise in cytosolic calcium leading to cellular dysfunction together with nitric oxide (NO) and reactive nitrogen species (RNC). Thus, it is a major factor of the cytopathology of many diseases including NDDs and their models (see Calabrese et al. 2007; Fatokun et al. 2008; Gardiner et al. 2009; Halliwell 2006; Nunomura et al. 2009; Petrozzi et al. 2007). The generation of ROS during early-stage protein aggregation may be a common fundamental molecular mechanism underlying their pathogenesis. Recent studies suggest that generation of excessive NO and ROS, in part due to overactivity of the NMDA-subtype of glutamate receptors, can mediate protein misfolding in the absence of genetic predisposition (Nakamura and Lipton 2009).

Among the various free radicals generated in the living organism, hydroxyl radical and peroxynitrite are the most potent and can damage cells via non-selective oxidation of proteins, lipids, fatty acids, and nucleic acid (Barnham et al. 2004; Nunomura et al. 2009). They are formed via the Haber–Weiss and Fenton reaction between H₂O₂ and reduced transition metals (usually iron II or copper) (see Zatta 2003). Proteins are initial targets of ROS, and protein radicals generated by ROS can oxidize reduced glutathione (GSH), suggesting that radicals are important for OS, which triggers dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, reactive astrogliosis and other changes observed in ND (Bond and Greenfield 2007). Increases in oxidative damage do not necessitate that the cell is succumbing to OS, given that cells may have increased their defenses sufficiently to compensate for the increased flux of reactive oxygen responsible for the damage. This concept is criticallyoutlined by evidence suggesting that cells which fail to compensate for oxidative imbalance (stress) enter apoptosis with rapid cell death, while those with compensatory response to ROS (antioxidant enzymes, low molecular weight reductants, etc.) may show long-term survival. Many researches focus on the relationship between mitochondrial (mt) DNA damage, apoptosis, and OS (Yang et al. 2008b), but, there is no clear and defined mechanism showing how OS plays a key role in the regulation of cell survival and death through its interaction with cellular molecules and signal transduction pathways in NDDs (Trushina and McMurray 2007).

Increased levels of oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, and proteins have been detected in postmortem tissues from patients with PD, AD, ALS, PSP, and related disorders, and some of these changes may occur early in disease progression (Tabner et al. 2005). Lipid peroxidation is an early event in the brain in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (MCI) (Markesbery et al. 2005; Petersen et al. 2007; Sultana et al. 2009; Sun et al. 2008). Oxidative damage to nuclear and mtDNA occurs in the earliest detectable phase of AD, PD and HD (Browne and Beal 2006; Nunomura et al. 2001, 2009; Wang et al. 2006), but also in normal aging (Pratico and Sung 2004).

Although the precise sources of increased oxidative damage are not fully clear, increased localization of redox-active transition metals in brain regions most affected by ND is consistent with their contribution to OS. Free radical oxygen chemistry plays an important pathogenic role in all these conditions, though it is as yet undetermined what types of oxidative damage occur early in the pathogenic cascade and which ones are secondary manifestation of dying neurons (Emerit et al. 2004; Mancuso et al. 2006; Sayre et al. 2008).

Recent results suggest that hydrogen peroxide accumulates during the incubation of Aβ or αSyn and hyperphosphorylated tau that show a close interrelationship (Geddes 2005), synergistic action (Mamah et al. 2005; Wenning and Jellinger 2005), and induce a mutual fibrillation (Frasier and Wolozin 2004; Giasson et al. 2003; Kotzbauer et al. 2004). This is subsequently converted to hydroxyl radicals by the addition of Fe(II) by Fenton’s reaction, one of the fundamental mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative processes as a direct sequelae of H₂O₂ production during the formation of abnormal protein aggregates (Tabner et al. 2002).

Metals and oxidative stress

Alterations in metal homeostasis induce increased production of free radicals, primarily catalyzed by iron or copper, being directly involved in the neurodegenerative process in various disorders (Linert et al. 2006). This suggests a direct cause–effect relationship between disruption in metal homeostasis and the increased oxidative damage; brain ferritin iron being a risk factor for age at onset of NDDs (Bartzokis et al. 2004; Ward and Crichton 2006). In AD, aberrant metal homeostasis may contribute to the formation of ROS and toxic Aβ oligomers, thus, facilitating the formation of amyloid plaques (Maynard et al. 2005) and increased lipid peroxidation precedes Aβ plaque formation in an animal model of AD (Pratico et al. 2001). Another mechanism of lipid peroxidation has been attributed to increased formation of peroxynitrite from nitric oxide (NO) and superoxide.

Iron is a powerful promoter of free radical damage, able to catalyze generation of highly reactive radicals from H₂O₂ and lipid peroxides, generating OS. Although most iron in the brain is stored in ferritin, “catalytic” iron is readily mobilized from injured brain tissue. There is increasing evidence that iron misregulation is involved in the mechanisms that underlie many NDDs (Ke and Ming Qian 2003; Ward and Crichton 2006). Conditions such as neuroferritinopathy (Maciel et al. 2005; Mancuso et al. 2005) and Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) are associated with mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in iron metabolism, and as the brain ages, iron accumulates in regions that are affected by AD and PD (Altamura and Muckenthaler 2009; Gerlach et al. 2006; Linert et al. 2006; Zecca et al. 2004).

Toxic interactions between reactive transition metals and free radicals are regulated by GSH. Perturbations of its metabolism are documented in NDDs, associated with abnormalities in copper and calcium homeostasis and redox balance (Castellani et al. 2000; Wojda et al. 2008). High concentrations of reactive iron can increase OS-induced neuronal vulnerability, and iron accumulation might increase the toxicity of environmental or endogenous substances. Formation of Aβ oligomers in brain vascular smooth muscle cells is triggered by transient exposure to iron-induced OS (Frackowiak et al. 2009). The accumulation and precipitation of proteins may be aggravated by OS, and may, in turn, cause more oxidative damage by interfering with the function of the proteasome, that increases levels of OS not only to proteins but also to other biomolecules (Halliwell 2006).

Oxidative stress in Alzheimer disease

In both human AD and transgenic (tg) mouse models of AD, oxidative damage occurs preceding Aβ deposition that further contributes to OS and ND (Butterfield and Boyd-Kimball 2004; Pratico et al. 2001; Sonnen et al. 2008). OS induces macroautophagy of Aβ protein and ensuing apoptosis (Zheng et al. 2009). Mutant APP and its derivatives are involved in the generation of free radicals in
mitochondria and cause mitochondrial oxidative damage, linking Aβ, generation of free radicals, and oxidative damage in the pathogenesis of AD (Reddy 2006). Increasing evidence suggests that OS (Aβ, iron/hydrogen peroxide) or neurotoxic by-products of lipid peroxidation (4-hydroxy-2-nonenal, acrolein) damage DNA and lead to programmed cell death in AD (Lovell and Markesbery 2006). Major components are lipid and protein peroxidation, glycosidation with DNA oxidation and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs), protein-bound oxidation products of sugar (Montine and Morrow 2005; Reddy et al. 2002). In AD, PD, and other NDDs, the production of AGEs and their receptors has been observed (Wang et al. 2009b). Since they are both markers of transitional metal-induced OS and inducers of protein cross-linking and free radical formation, they may reflect early disease-specific changes rather than late epiphenomena (Shaikh and Nicholson 2008). AGEs co-localize with inducible NO synthase in AD, supporting an AGE-induced OS. AGE receptors (RAGE) may be a progression factor for Aβ-induced cell perturbations (Yan et al. 2009), and neuronal RAGE-mediated activation of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK) contributes to Aβ-mediated cortical synaptic dysfunction (Origlia et al. 2008). In AD, RAGE levels of the BBB are increased and low-density lipoprotein receptor related protein-1 (LRP1) levels at the BBB and the capacity of soluble LRP1 (sLRP1) to bind peripheral Aβ are reduced, forcing Aβ accumulation in the brain (Deane et al. 2009). ROS levels appear to be correlated with age, suggesting that oxidative imbalance observed in AD could be due to a decreased total antioxidant capacity (Guidi et al. 2006). Oxidative damage to DNA and RNA repair is particularly severe in the hippocampus, the earliest and most severely involved brain area. RNA is extensively modified in AD and, while clearly damaged, its rapid turnover may also serve a protective function (Nunomura et al. 2006, 2009). Stress-activated protein kinase pathways triggered by OS, are excessively activated in AD (Johnson and Bailey 2003; Petersen et al. 2007), even in early stages, deregulating cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), compromising the cellular antioxidant defense system and causing mitochondrial damage (Sun et al. 2008). S-nitrosylation of dynamin-related proetin 1 (Drp1) that is increased in AD brains, mediates Aβ-related mitochondrial fission and neuronal injury (Cho et al. 2009). Glutathionylation of the proapoptotic protein p53 may prevent the formation of tetramer, an aggregative form required for effective action of p53 and may be involved in OS conditions and ND in AD (Di Domenico et al. 2009). Tau phosphorylation is mediated by stress kinases (increased SAPK/JNK and p38) in dystrophic neurites of senile plaques (Ferrer et al. 2005). These and other data suggest that oxidative imbalance is

met by a series of complex reactions (mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired synaptic transmission, disruption of membrane integrity, impaired axonal transport, etc.) to establish a disease-related homeostasis balance (Crouch et al. 2008; Huber et al. 2007; Nunomura et al. 2006, 2009). Antioxidants may protect neurons in AD and PD, reducing the risk of ND (Head 2009; Zhao 2009).

Oxidative stress in Parkinson disease

In PD, many biochemical changes indicate compromised antioxidant systems suggested to underlie cellular vulnerability to progressive OS which generates excessive ROS or free radicals in SN with subsequent cell damage (see Jellinger 2007a; Linert et al. 2006; Miller et al. 2009; Olivares et al. 2009).

Significant increase of iron in the SNp with a shift of Fe(II):Fe(III) of 2:1 as compared to 1:2 in controls and loss of soluble αSyn, by its aggregation, can increase dopamine synthesis with accompanying increased generation of reactive metabolites, finally leading to degeneration (Gerlach et al. 2006; Götz et al. 2004). On the other hand, dopamine (DA) tends to stabilize the oligomeric forms and prevents aggregation of αSyn, which may be one of the reasons for the selective vulnerability of DAergic neurons (Conway et al. 2001). Sequestration of redox-active iron in LBs of PD SN substantiates the OS hypothesis (Castellani et al. 2000; Faucheux et al. 2003). Both reduced GSH, an important compound of antioxidative defense and protein repair, and GSH peroxidase activity are decreased in SN of PD and in incidental LB disease (preclinical PD), probably preceding both complex I and DA loss (Jha et al. 2000). SOD, an enzyme indicative of superoxide generation, shows increase of both isoenzymes (Cu–Zn–SOD and Mn–SOD) in PD SN, in AD and ALS suggesting increased superoxide generation (Choi et al. 2005). Increase of intracellular 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-HOG), produced by free radical damage in DNA in SN neurons corresponds to its degeneration pattern. Increased peripheral 8-HOG levels in MSA, AD, and ALS suggest that systemic DNA/RNA oxidation is common in these diseases (Kikuchi et al. 2002). Peroxynitrite, formed by reduced SOD, induces aggregation of αSyn in situ, and nitrated αSyn is found in the core of LBs indicating their in damaging structural proteins (Tsang and Chung 2008). Cross-linking of αSyn by AGEs in PD and in incidental LB disease, suggests that AGE-promoted LB formation may reflect early disease-specific changes, accelerating inclusion body formation (Shaikh and Nicholson 2008). Demonstration of hydroxynonenal (HNE) in LBs indicates that peroxidation may play a role in their formation and produce neuronal death due to OS (Qin et al. 2007). There is evidence of
OS in the neocortex already in incidental LB disease, a subclinicalform of early PD (Dalfo et al. 2005).

Genetic studies have implicated OS in PD pathogenesis (Kim et al. 2005; Martinat et al. 2004; Taira et al. 2004). Abnormal αSyn as found in LBs produces hydrogen peroxide and the neurons are capable of dissecting antioxidant enzymes to regions of OS, and that glutathione peroxidase (GP+1)-positive microglia are involved in neuroprotection in PD and DLB (Power and Blumbergs 2009). αSyn is upregulated in a subset of neurons in response to chronic OS and is associated with neuroprotection from relatively low levels of OS (Quilty et al. 2006). Formation of αSyn protofibrils is stimulated by translational modifications that occur under conditions of OS, while its aggregation is inhibited by antioxidants and various proteins with chaperone activity (Rochet and Liu 2009). Protein misfolding of sporadic PD has been associated with reactive oxygen species formed as products of O₂ reduction by combination of DA and Fe (Arreguin et al. 2009), but also triggers a cerebral tauopathy (Hoglinger et al. 2005). Chronic systemic treatment of rats with rotenone, a pesticide known to inhibit mitochondrial complex I, induces an increase in OS in DAergic neurons, which in turn may facilitate fibrillation of αSyn, does not cause a selective nigrostriatal dopaminergic damage, but rather a more generalized cell death (Hoglinger et al. 2006).

Many of the above factors may participate in the pathogenesis of experimental models of PD indicating a multicomponent process involving toxic-induced death, OS, defective mitochondrial complex I, protein aggregation, impairment of UPS, etc. (see Przedborski 2009).

### Oxidative stress in other neurodegenerative disorders

OS is also recognized as a major pathogenic factor in other NDDs, e.g., in HD, where in both human brain and in tg mouse models, increased indices of OS markers have been reported (Trushina and McMurray 2007). The crucial initiation mechanism induced by mutant huntingtin (mhtt) is still unclear, but a large body of evidence supports an early and critical involvement of defects in mitochondrial function and CNS energy metabolism in the disease trigger (Browne and Beal 2006). Proteomic and OS analyses in human brain samples of HD indicate that OS and damage to specific macromolecules would participate in disease progression (Sorolla et al. 2008).

Production of lipid peroxidation, e.g., HNE and malondialdehyde is increased in both AD and PSP and its occurrence is proportional to the extent of tau pathology (Odetti et al. 2000). In PSP, increased lipid peroxidation in cerebral cortex (Martinez et al. 2008), increased activity of antioxidant systems, e.g., SOD and GSH, in multiple brain areas (Cantuti-Castelvetri et al. 2002), and activated stress-related proteins, such as SKPK/JNK and p38 SAPK have been described (Ferrer et al. 2001). Abnormal processing of p53, the regulatory subunit of Cdk5, a kinase modulating the noxious effect of hyperperoxidation on tau protein through the overproduction of the kinase involved in tau hyperphosphorylation, in AD is a major source of phosphorylated tau aggregates. In PSP, total Cdk5 protein levels, in contrast to AD, are more than threefold increased and co-localized with tau immunoreactivity, indicating that in PSP this alteration is different from that in AD which may be due to the absence of Aβ protein deposition (Borghi et al. 2002). Recent studies showed that oxidative damage affects regions vulnerable to PSP and AGD (Santpere and Ferrer 2009b). Increased OS is important in both sporadic and familial (s, f) ALS. The two principal hypotheses on the pathogenesis of ALS are: (a) oxidative damage stemming from aberrant SOD1 redox chemistry, and (b) misfolding of the mutant protein (Kabashi and Durham 2006; Rakhit and Chakrabarty 2006). Enhanced basal oxidoradical products, lipid peroxide, perturbed calcium homeostasis, and increased nitrotyrosine in lower motoneurons of both tg mice and human ALS are present. Zn-deficient SOD induces apoptosis in motoneurons through a mechanism involving peroxynitrite, which could explain why mitochondrial damage is the earliest marker of injury in ALS–SOD mutant mice (Beckman et al. 2001). At the terminal stage of ALS, a disruption of GSH peroxidase PrxII/GPxI-overexpression mechanism was observed and motoneurons are particularly vulnerable to aggregation of mutant SOD1. These findings suggest that the residual ALS neurons showing redox system upregulation would be less susceptible, whereas the breakdown of this redox system at the advanced disease stage accelerates neuronal degeneration and/or death (Kato et al. 2005). Because only a subset of ALS cases can be attributed to one particular deficit, e.g., mutation of SOD1 of the gene encoding neurofilament H, ALS etiology is likely to be multifactorial, but the precise mechanisms by which SOD1 leads to ND have not been defined (Barber et al. 2006).

In summary, free radical-mediated damage to lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids is at least a part of the pathogenic events in the majority of NDDs. Oxidative damage should be considered a window to view both some of the basic pathogenic cascades leading to ND and the homeostatic compensations necessary for survival and as a means to design strategies to modify fundamental abnormalities, preventing or delaying the progress of these diseases.

### Impaired bioenergetics and mitochondrial dysfunction

By producing ATP and regulating intracellular calcium levels, mitochondria, the “energy powerhouse of the cell”,
Recent advances in our understanding of neurodegeneration

Fig. 6 Proposed cascade leading to neuronal death related to mitochondrial defects in disorders associated with aggregation of amyloidogenic proteins via activation of caspases

are vital for the function and survival of neurons. They provide energy from aerobic metabolism; oxidative phosphorylation via the oxidative phosphorylation system (OXPHOS) is the principal source of high-energy compounds (McBride et al. 2006; Yang et al. 2008b). These proteins link mitochondrial function and dynamics to the regulation of metabolism, cell-cycle control, development, and cell death, giving evidence that provides molecular definition to mitochondria as a central platform in the execution of diverse cellular events (McBride et al. 2006).

Mitochondria are both targets and important sources of ROS. Generation of reactive oxidants, including ROS, is increased in damaged mitochondria and in cells with compromised mitochondrial function. Acute exposure to high levels of oxidants can induce the mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), uncouple oxidative phosphorylation with catastrophic effects on mitochondrial energetics, and contribute to cytotoxicity via necrosis and/or apoptosis through release of cytochrome c, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) (Ribe et al. 2008). OS and damage to mitochondrial DNA during aging impair mitochondrial energy metabolism and ion homeostasis in neurons, thereby rendering them vulnerable to degeneration (Kwong et al. 2006; Lin and Beal 2006; Yang et al. 2008b). Impaired bioenergetics and dysfunction of mitochondrial energy metabolism lead to reduced ATP production, impaired calcium buffering, and generation of ROS, representing a “deadly triad in neurodegeneration” (Celsi et al. 2009; Knott et al. 2008).

In a variety of tissues, cumulative OS, disrupted mitochondrial respiration, and oxidative mitochondrial damage are associated with, and may promote cell death and degeneration (Halliwell 2006; Nunomura et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2008b). Perturbations in the physiological function of mitochondria disturb cell function, cause mtDNA damage, sensitize cells to neurotoxic insults and may initiate cell death, all significant phenomena in the pathogenesis of NDDs (Andersen 2004; Beal 2007; Mancuso et al. 2008a; Maracchioni et al. 2007; Schapira 2008; Weissman et al. 2007; Yang et al. 2008b). The mtDNA may play an essential role in the pathogenesis of the respiratory chain complex activities in NDDs such as HD, that shows multiple mtDNA deletions in over 60% of HD patients, probably caused by CAG repeats instability and mhtt (Banoei et al. 2007). OXPHOS disorders ranging from Leigh disease to PD and AD are caused by defects of mitochondrial energy metabolism, related to complex deficiency (Distelmaier et al. 2009).

Downregulation of Lon, an ATP-stimulated protease in mitochondria, leads to the accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, which aggregate, followed by apoptosis (Bota et al. 2005). There are several pathways by which both mitochondrial dysfunction and protein aggregation may interact (Fig. 6). Both aggregated SOD and Aβ in the mitochondrial matrix could contribute to cell death by triggering apoptosis, the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (PTP), being crucial in both necrotic and apoptotic cell death, is controlled by antiapoptotic members of the Bax/Bcl-2 family (Armstrong 2006). Its activation increases the inner mitochondrial membrane permeability to solubles and its membrane adenine nucleotide transporter, the voltage-dependent anion channel and the peripheral GABA receptor in the outer membrane. Mitochondrial Bax interacts with the voltage-dependent anion channel to accelerate opening of the PTP which is favored by Ca²⁺ and oxidizing
agents, contributing to cytochrome $c$ release. A consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction is increased generation of free radicals and oxidative damage. In both s- and f-PD, abnormal mitochondrial paradigms include impaired function of the electron transport chain, damage to mtDNA, impaired calcium buffering, and anomalies in mitochondrial morphology and dynamics (Banerjee et al. 2008).

A decrease in the DNA base excision repair (BER) activity in NDDs suggests that that the brain might be subjected to the double insult of increased DNA damage, as well as deficiencies of DNA repair pathways (Katyal and McKinnon 2007; Martin 2008). Recently, the importance of microRNAs (miRNAs), brain-enriched, small noncoding RNAs that participate in RNA translational and protein expression regulation, has been emphasized, suggesting their involvement in the emergence or progression of NDDs (Bushati and Cohen 2008; Nelson et al. 2008), including AD (Cogswell et al. 2008).

Mitochondrial dysfunction in Alzheimer and Parkinson disease

There is evidence of impaired DNA repair in both the aging brain and AD (Katyal and McKinnon 2008), suggesting that this may play a role in AD pathogenesis (Coppede and Migliore 2009). Although the molecular basis underlying the decline in mitochondrial function is not really understood, recent experimental evidence has shed some light on the pivotal role of mitochondrial morphology control and dysregulated mitochondrial fusion and fission events in the process of ND (Frank 2006; Lu 2009). Whether these change are a secondary consequence of other factors or whether they cause eventual cell death is unknown (Reeve et al. 2008).

In AD, there is a large body of evidence implicating impaired energy metabolism and oxidative damage (Bubber et al. 2005; Lin and Beal 2006). AD brains showed an average 50% reduction in mtRNA content that, together with other changes, is likely to reduce oxidative phosphorylation. However, spectroscopic enzyme analysis of respiratory complexes in brain homogenates did not support the primary contribution of mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction in AD (Casademont et al. 2005). Morphological, biochemical and genetic abnormalities of the mitochondria in several AD tissues have been reported, which often do not coexist with cytoskeletal pathology and accumulation of $A \beta$ deposits (Baloyannis 2006). Impaired mitochondrial respiration, particularly COX deficiency, has been observed in brain, platelets and fibroblasts of AD patients. The “mitochondrial cascade hypothesis” could explain many of the biochemical, genetic and pathological features of sporadic AD. Somatic mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could cause energy failure, increased oxidative stress and accumulation of $A \beta$, which in a vicious cycle reinforces the mtDNA damage and the oxidative stress. $A \beta$ peptide interacts with an $A \beta$-binding dehydrogenase (ABAD) in mitochondria of patients with AD and of tg mice, suggesting that ABAD is clearly related, as molecular link, to mitochondrial toxicity (Lustbader et al. 2004). Despite the evidence of mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, no causative mutations in the mtDNA have been detected so far. Indeed, results of studies on the role of mtDNA haplogroups in AD are controversial (Mancuso et al. 2008b). Mitochondrial dysfunction in AD is caused by phospholipase-2-mediated oligomeric $A \beta$, leading to impairment of ATP production and increase of OS in AD brain (Zhu et al. 2006). It may also be caused by impaired axonal transport that is accompanied by proximal collection of mitochondria which could contribute to loss of distal synapses (Stokin et al. 2005). Caspase-cleaved tau expression results in mitochondrial dysfunction in cortical neurons via increased calcineurin activity in AD brains (Quintanilla et al. 2009). An increase in the number of COX-deficient succinate dehydrogenase (SDH)-positive hippocampal pyramidal neurons provided evidence that a substantial mitochondrial enzyme activity defect occurs more frequently in AD than in normal aging. Both APP and $\gamma$-secretase, as well as an isoform of insulin-degrading enzyme, which regulates $A \beta$ levels, are present in mitochondria (Leissring et al. 2004). These and other data suggest a significant increase in oxidative damage to mtDNA in AD brain accompanied by increased levels of numerous other markers of OS (see Lin and Beal 2006), causing abnormal mitochondrial dynamics and dysfunction that ultimately damage AD neurons (Wang et al. 2009c).

Mitochondrial alterations and OS are important parts of the multifactorial pathogenic process of PD (Henchcliffe and Beal 2008; Muqit et al. 2006; Onyango 2008; Schapira 2008; Vila et al. 2008). Since the UPS requires ATP at several steps, impaired mitochondrial function may impair its activity. More importantly, increased production of ROS leads to damaged misfolded proteins requiring degradation by the UPS. Parkin plays a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis, improves mitochondrial dysfunction, regulates their remodeling, promotes their autophagy, promotes DNA repair, and protects against genotoxicity (Kao 2009; Mitsui et al. 2008; Narendra et al. 2008; Park et al. 2009; Poole et al. 2008; Van Laar and Berman 2009). On the other hand, proteasomal inhibition reduced mitochondrial complex I and II activities, increased mitochondrial ROS production, and the presence of damaged mitochondria in autophagosomes (Sullivan et al. 2004).
In PD, the association between ND, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative damage, or both, stems from studies in the MPTP model showing inhibition of complex I, leading to reduction in mitochondrial ATP production and increased generation of ROS. Both contribute to neuronal cell death via decreased protein pumping and reduced voltage differential across the inner mitochondrial membrane inducing not direct opening of the mitochondrial PTP, but rather leading to an increase of the “releasable” soluble pool of cytochrome c in the mitochondrial intermembrane space that can subsequently be released by activation of PDC pathways (Perier et al. 2005; Przedborski et al. 2004). Similar mitochondrial impairment is seen in human PD with decreased levels of the antioxidant compound GSH that is suggested to precede both complex I and DA loss. High levels of mtDNA deletions in SN neurons in aging and PD suggest that they are important in the selective neuronal loss in these conditions (Bender et al. 2006), as are decreases in ATP production and ATP-sensitive potassium channels (Liss et al. 2005; Moore et al. 2005). A specific protein–protein interaction of αSyn and COX, a key enzyme of the mitochondrial respiratory chain, suggests that αSyn aggregation may contribute to enhanced mitochondrial dysfunction (Gupta et al. 2008). αSyn is a central regulator of DA life cycle, and as an effector of DA-dependent OS may have a role in both neurodegeneration and neuroprotection (Sidhu et al. 2004).

Mitochondrial αSyn dose-dependently down-regulates complex I activity, in vitro impairs mitochondrial function and leads to increased OS (Hsu et al. 2000; Liu et al. 2009). Both rotenone and chronic MPTP result in oxidative damage and αSyn aggregates closely resembling LBs (Fornai et al. 2005), which were not reproduced by others (Alvarez-Fischer et al. 2008), while subacute rotenone treatment of SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells reproduced Lewy neurites but not LB inclusions, reduces mitochondrial movement and slowly killed neural cells (Borland et al. 2008). Mutations in parkin which causes recessive early-onset PD, is associated with marked mitochondrial abnormalities and less resistance to OS induced by paraquat (Greene et al. 2003). Several studies have implicated mtDNA abnormalities and mitochondrial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis, and a link between mitochondrial dysfunction, OS, protein misfolding, and abnormal autophagy is becoming increasingly prominent (Gupta et al. 2008; Lin and Beal 2006; Olanow et al. 2008).

Reduction of cerebral mitochondrial metabolism is seen in early PD (Powers et al. 2008), but whether mitochondrial dysfunction is a primary or secondary event, or part of a multifactorial pathogenic process remains to be elucidated (Przedborski 2009; Schapira 2009; Vila et al. 2008). Although most mitochondrial proteins are encoded by nuclear DNA (nDNA), mtDNA defects can cause

numerous diseases, many of which are associated with ND, which can be a consequence of either mtDNA or nDNA mutations which have effects on mitochondrial proteins (Lin and Beal 2006). However, recent studies indicated that pathogenic-inherited mtDNA mutations do not constitute a major etiological factor in sporadic AD or may even reduce the risk of AD (Elson et al. 2006). In PSP, significant decrease in aconitase activity, cellular ATP level, and oxygen consumption with reduced mitochondrial enzyme aKH-DNC in cybrids suggests a contributory role of impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism (Lin and Beal 2006). A classification of NDDs with genetic causes of bioenergetic deficits is given in Table 3.

### Nuclear DNA-encoded mitochondrial defects

FRDA, an autosomal recessive disease, resulting from mutation in the FRDA (PFRDA-1) gene on chromosome 9, which encodes frataxin, a mitochondrially targeted protein (Kaplan 2002). Trinucleotide repeat (GAG) expansion in the first intron or point mutations in the other allele, reduce frataxin expression and impairs iron incorporation into iron–sulfur clusters. This leads to iron accumulations in mitochondria and deficient activity of relevant enzymes, including complexes I and II of the electron transport chain. Accumulation of mitochondrial iron may lead to impaired oxidative phosphorylation, loss of mtDNA, increase in iron and OS (Bulteau et al. 2004). However, a tg mouse model showed no attenuation of the phenotype after the administration of antioxidants (Seznec et al. 2005).

The precise sequence of events in FRDA pathogenesis is uncertain. The impaired intramitochondrial metabolism with increased free iron levels and a defective mitochondrial respiratory chain, associated with increased free radical generation and oxidative damage, may be considered possible mechanisms that compromise cell viability. Recent evidence suggests that frataxin might detoxify ROS via activation of glutathione peroxidase and elevation of thiols, and in addition, that decreased expression of frataxin protein is associated with FRDA. Many approaches have been undertaken to understand FRDA, but the heterogeneity of the etiologic factors makes it difficult to define the clinically most important factor determining the onset and progression of the disease. However, increasing evidence indicates that factors such as OS and disturbed protein metabolism and their interaction in a vicious cycle are central to FRDA pathogenesis. Brains of FRDA patients undergo many changes, such as disruption of protein synthesis and degradation, classically associated with the heat shock response, which is one form of stress response.

encoding a copper transporting ATPase, results in the accumulation of copper in the liver and basal ganglia causing cirrhosis and progressive dystonia. Increase of mitochondrial copper concentrations results in oxidative damage similar to that seen in FRDA (Lin and Beal 2006). Leigh disease, producing dystonia, can be caused by mutations of SURF1 and other nuclear (NDUF) genes that regulate the assembly of COX. Some forms of dystonia have mutations in the mtDNA-encoded ND6 subunit of the electron transport chain, DYT-1 type at torsin A (TOR1A) locus (Warner and Hammans 2008). Paroxysmal non-kinesigenic dyskinesia (PNKD), an autosomal-dominant movement disorder, is due to a novel disease mechanism based on a deleterious action of the myofibrillogenesis regulator-1 (MR-1) gene (Ghezzi et al. 2009).

**Biochemical lesions include impaired complex II and III activity in basal ganglia, while ultrastructural studies of cortical biopsies of HD patients showed abnormal mitochondria (Lin and Beal 2006; Turner et al. 2007). Mutated htt is aggregated together with Ub in nuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions in human HD and mouse mutants leading to neuronal degeneration (Benchoua et al. 2006). Mitochondria in mutant cells are particularly vulnerable to stresses induced by Ca²⁺ and reactive oxygen species (Lim et al. 2008), and mhtt aggregates impair mitochondrial movement and intracellular vesicular trafficking in cortical neurons (Chang et al. 2006; Caviston and Holzbaur 2009). Irrespective of whether the principal toxic action of mhtt directly or secondarily impacts mitochondria, the repercussions of sufficient mitochondrial dysfunction are catastrophic to cells and may arguably underlie many of the other disruptions in cellular processes that evolve during HD pathogenesis (Browne 2008). The increase in cytotoxicity induced by Htt proteins containing expanded polyQ tracts is likely mediated, at least in part, by an alteration in normal mitochondrial dynamics, which results in increased mitochondrial fragmentation. Furthermore, it might be possible to reverse polyQ-induced cytotoxicity by preventing mitochondrial fragmentation (Wang et al. 2009a). In addition to mitochondrial dysfunction, excitotoxic neuronal death related to altered NMDA receptor**

Nuclear DNA mutations with secondary mitochondrial dysfunction

HD is an autosomal-dominant disorder, the gene mutation of which is an expansion of a trinucleotide repeat in the htt gene, the mutation length correlates with cell type-specific vulnerability in HD brain (Shelbourne et al. 2007). Its mutated form binds to the outer mitochondrial membrane and reduces its calcium uptake capacity, and upregulates p53 leading to mitochondrial membrane depolarization.

function induced by mhtt is an important factor in the pathogenesis of HD (Cowan and Raymond 2006; Estrada Sanchez et al. 2008; Fan and Raymond 2007).

In hereditary spinocerebellar degenerations (SCA), gene mutations causing an expansion in trinucleotide repeats in the coding region of ataxin and SCA1-19 leads to the deposition of TBP protein and neuronal degeneration that could be related, at least in part, to defects in energy metabolism demonstrated by reduction of both N-acetyl-aspartate (NAA) and creatinine as well as of complex II and III reflecting impaired mitochondrial energy production. Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA 1) results from polyglutamate-repeat expansion of the protein encoded by the gene ataxin-1 which is a substrate of the E3 ubiquitin ligase UBE3A and mutant ataxin-1 is resistant to Ub-dependent proteolysis. An ataxin-1 interacting protein known as ataxin-1 interacting Ub-like protein (A1Up) possesses N-terminal UBL and C-terminal UBA domains. It also contains heat shock protein chaperonin-binding motifs. The UBL is necessary for A1Up's association with the 19S proteasome and this association is inhibited by mutant polyglutamine repeat ataxin-1 (Riley et al. 2004). Thus, disruption of the delivery of ubiquitinated ataxin-1 to the proteasome may account for ubiquitin immunopositive nuclear inclusions observed in Purkinje, pontine and inferior olive neurons observed in SCA1.

Machado–Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is caused by a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion that is translated into an abnormally long polyQ tract in the protein ataxin-3-encoded chromosome 14, and aggregates containing this expanded protein are the major components of nuclear deposits in the brain. Decreased protein synthesis of Hsp27 caused by ataxin-3 is associated with cellular toxicity in a cell model of MJD (Chang et al. 2009). Ataxin-3 binds poly-Ub chains and acts as a deubiquitinating enzyme (Berke et al. 2005). Ataxin-3 itself is a target of ubiquitination which may enhance deubiquitinating activity (Todi et al. 2009) and increase mitochondrial DNA models of MJD (Yu et al. 2009b).

Mitochondrial DNA-encoded mitochondrial defects

This disease group includes Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON), caused by mutations of the OPA1 gene, encoding a dynamin-like mitochondrial GTPase (Amati-Bonneau et al. 2009). It encodes a dynamin-related protein localized to mitochondria. Its downregulation in vitro results in the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by release of cytochrome *c*, and activation of caspase and apoptosis (Olichon et al. 2003). Phosphorylated neurofilament heavy chain is a marker of ND in LHON (Guy et al. 2008). Kearns–Sayre syndrome (KSS/chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia), a spongiiform encephalopathy with ragged-red fibers due to paracrystalline mitochondria in skeletal muscle, is usually associated with mtRNA deletion in the muscle. Other related mitochondrial encephalopathies are MERFF (myoclonus epilepsy and ragged-red fibers) with mental deterioration and myopathy, due to the mutation of an A-to-C transition at nucleotide 8,344 in the mtRNA-Lys gene or rare mutations in tRNA-ser gene, or MELAS (mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and stroke-like episodes), caused by a mutation of nucleotide 3,243 in the mtRNA Leu/UUR gene (for review see (Mikol and Polivka 2005; Warner and Hammans 2008).

Possible mtDNA-encoded mitochondrial defects

In both s- and f-ALS, mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with SOD1 mutation (Gruzman et al. 2007). More recently, mutations of the RNA-metabolizing protein TDP-43 have been uncovered in rare autosomal-dominant familial cases (Sreedharan et al. 2008) and TDP-43 deposits are seen in most sALS cases. TDP-43 gene and protein may be more common than SOD1 mutations in both f- and s-ALS (Rothstein 2009). Expression of mutant SOD1 in cell cultures leads to mitochondrial dysfunction, and mice expressing the G9eA SOD1 mutation develop mitochondrial energy dysfunction in spinal cord and brain, with severely compromised ATP synthesis (Liu et al. 2004). SOD1 is present in the outer membrane, the intermembrane space, and the mitochondrial matrix, where it forms aggregates, which may contribute to mitochondrial dysfunction (Vijayvergiya et al. 2005). The intracellular co-occurrence of SOD1 and chromogranins, constituents of dense core vesicles, in motor neurons suggests a functional interaction between these proteins (Schrott-Fischer et al. 2009). Mutant, but not wild-type SOD1 binds to heat shock proteins, leading to the formation of aggregates preventing their entry into mitochondria and to Bcl-2 which may promote apoptosis. Current hypothesis for the underlying pathobiology of ALS include oxidative damage, accumulation of intracellular aggregates (SOD1, TDP-43), implying abnormal RNA metabolism, mitochondrial dysfunction, defects in axonal transport, growth factor deficiency, astroglial pathology, and glutamate excitotoxicity (Rothstein 2009), abnormal RNA metabolism probably representing a central pathway for motor neuron degeneration (Simpson et al. 2009).

The evidence in favor of energetic defects in major NDDs only in part has been proven by the identification of genetic defects that are causally linked to mitochondrial dysfunction. If this has a causative role to disease pathogenesis, then a number of therapeutic targets are implicated, including the PTP, cytochrome *c* release, free radical scavengers that could result in novel treatments.

Fragmentation of neuronal Golgi apparatus

Fragmentation of the neuronal Golgi apparatus (GA) was reported in ALS, corticobasal degeneration, AD, PD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) (Fan et al. 2008). In tg mice expressing the G93A mutant of Cu/Zn SOD1 of familial ALS (fALS), fragmentation of the GA of spinal motor neurons and aggregation of mutant protein were detected and cells expressing the G93A and G85R mutants of SOD1 showed fragmentation of the GA and decreased viability without apoptosis. Mechanisms involved in Golgi fragmentation include: (a) dysregulation by mutant SOD1 of the microtubule-destabilizing protein Stathmin, (b) disruption by mutant SOD1 of the neuronal cytoplasmic dynein, (c) coprecipitation of mutant SOD1 with Hsp25 and Hsp27, (d) reduction of detyrosinated microtubules by aggregated tau which resulted in non-apoptotic cell death, and (e) disruption by mutant growth hormone of the trafficking from the rough ER to the GA (Gonatas et al. 2006). These data indicate that neuronal Golgi fragmentation is an early and probably irreversible lesion in ND, e.g., in nigral neurons with αSyn-positive inclusions in PD (Fujita et al. 2006), caused by a variety of mechanisms including accumulation of misfolded proteins. αSyn has been shown to block ER Golgi traffic (Cooper et al. 2006). Golgi fragmentation is not secondary to apoptosis but it may “trigger” apoptosis (Fig. 7) (Fan et al. 2008). Htt has a role in protein trafficking between the Golgi and the extracellular space (Strehlow et al. 2007).

(De Vos et al. 2008; Roy et al. 2005). Most of the transport uses the microtubule system that is proposed to form a network of trafficking highways and also active proteins. Cargo is linked to the cytoskeleton by unidirectional motor proteins made of a motor domain that reversibly interacts with the cytoskeleton and converts chemical energy into motion. All axonal components are synthesized in the cell body and transported from there into the axonal processes (anterograde transport). A complementary mechanism transports cargo in the opposite direction, i.e., away from the axon into the cell body (retrograde transport). Similar mechanisms exist in the dendrites, regulated by synaptic plasticity, but little is known about these mechanisms. The retrograde transport is powered by members of the kinesin protein transport family, fast retrograde and slow anterograde transport, e.g., of neurofilament (NFL) proteins, by dynein (Morfini et al. 2006). Axonal transport of NFLs is regulated by NFL subunit head domain phosphorylation (Yates et al. 2009).

Three recent developments have highlighted the significance of disrupted cellular/axonal transport in human NDDs: (a) discovery of human motor protein mutations in these disorders, (b) axonal transport defects in animal and in vitro cellular models harboring human mutations, and (c) newly discovered roles for pathogenic proteins like APP, tau, presenilin, and synuclein, in the regulation of axonal transport (see Roy et al. 2005 for review). Mitochondrial transport in axons uses motors of kinesin families and cytoplasmic dynein, to translocate along microtubules, and bidirectional movement may be coordinated through interaction between dynein and kinesin-1. Many proteins identified to bind to kinesin-1 act as cargo, cargo receptors and regulators of kinesin-1 activity, and protein-protein interaction domains regulate kinesin-cargo interactions (Gindhart 2006). Translocation along actin filaments is probably driven by myosin V, but the protein(s) that

Disruption of cellular/axonal transport

There is growing evidence that defective neuronal and axonal transport play a mechanistic role in several NDDs
mediate docking with actin filaments remain(s) unknown (Hollenbeck and Saxton 2005). The axonal transport of tau occurs via a mechanism utilizing fast transport motors, including the kinesin family of proteins, and that αSyn transport in neurons may involve both kinesin and dynein motor proteins (Utton et al. 2005). Although motor protein defects in neurologic diseases point directly to defects in transport, it is possible that other disease proteins are directly or indirectly linked to axonal transport, defects of which could be reversed by specific interventions stabilizing microtubules and repair or protect axons (Inoue et al. 2009).

### Axonal transport in Alzheimer disease and tauopathies

Axonal transport is impaired in AD and other tauopathies (Roy et al. 2005; Schindowski et al. 2008a), probably early in their pathogenesis (Stokin et al. 2005). Proteolytic cleavage of APP occurs before its sorting into axonal transport vesicles (Muresan et al. 2009). It travels via fast axonal transport and in vesicular complexes containing presenilin and BACE and acts as a receptor for the anterograde motor kinesin. Misregulation of APP, either directly or from APP mutations, can transduce into misregulation of fast axonal transport (Gunawardena and Goldstein 2004). Disruption of fast axonal transport is a pathogenic mechanism for intraneuronal Aβ (Pigino et al. 2009). Tau, a microtubule-binding protein that, after its hyperphosphorylation and segregation into tangles, is unable to bind microtubuli, causing their destabilization and, thereby, disrupting axonal transport. Phosphorylation of neurofilament heavy chains (NFHs) also impairs neurofilament axonal transport due to increased pausing of neurofilament movement (Ackerley et al. 2003). Mice expressing the human tau mutation R406W, which is pathogenic for FTDP-17, show retarded transport leading to tau accumulation (Zhang et al. 2005a). Whether misregulation of axonal transport has a direct role in the pathogenesis of these disorders or is a secondary phenomenon remains to be elucidated.

### Axonal transport in synucleinopathies

αSyn is a highly conserved protein, strongly expressed in neurons and enriched in presynaptic terminals (Norris et al. 2004). It is mainly transported in the slow, but a part also in fast transport (Jensen et al. 1999). Significant age-related retardation in synuclein transport may lead to accumulation of αSyn over time and produces pathology in axons suggesting axonal transport abnormalities in synucleinopathies (Li et al. 2004). Recent studies in DLB and PD, using modern techniques to demonstrate small αSyn aggregates, showed heavy accumulation of these in presynaptic terminals associated with loss of dendritic spines. This suggests a severe pathologic impact on synaptic functions leading to ND, implicating PD as a synaptopathy (Kramer and Schulz-Schaeffer 2007).

Axonal transport in other neurodegenerative diseases

In SOD-1, tg models of ALS show retarded transport of neurofilament proteins and deficits in the delivery of mitochondria to the axon by fast transport, even before the onset of symptoms was seen implicated impaired axonal transport as an early defect in the onset and progress of ND, but, to date, no motor protein gene mutation in human ALS has been reported (Rothstein 2009).

HD shows striatal degeneration with aggregation of htt within vesicles and moves in the fast axonal transport component. In animal models, this was inhibited by infusion with pathological polyglutamine repeats and by disruption of the *Drosophila* htt gene (Gunawardena and Goldstein 2004). Huntingtin plays a role in protein trafficking, vesicle transport, postsynaptic signaling, transcriptional regulation, and apoptosis. Thus, a loss of function of the normal protein and a toxic gain of function of the mhtt contribute to the disruption of multiple intracellular pathways. Furthermore, excitotoxicity, DA toxicity, metabolic impairment, mitochondrial dysfunction, OS, apoptosis, and autophagy have been implicated in the progressive degeneration observed in HD (Gil and Rego 2008). A htt-binding protein HAP1 interacts with the dynactin complex, important for dynein and possibly kinesin fast movements, and accumulated vesicles and organelles in dystrophic axons from human HD patients suggest that aggregates of polyQ repeats disrupt fast axonal transport.

### Action and mutations of molecular chaperones

Molecular chaperones have essential roles in many cellular processes, including protein folding, targeting, transport, degradation, and signal transduction. Cellular molecular chaperones, which are ubiquitous, stress-induced proteins, and newly found chemical and pharmacological chaperones have been found to be effective in preventing misfolding of different disease-causing proteins, essentially reducing the severity of several NDDs and many other protein-misfolding diseases. The role of molecular, chemical and pharmacological chaperones in suppressing the effect of protein misfolding-induced consequences in humans has been explained (Chaudhuri and Paul 2006). Conditions of stress are characterized by a robust increase in the synthesis of heat shock proteins (HSPs) that are crucial for recovery from stress-induced protein damage (Calabrese et al. 2005). Almost all HSPs, classified into sixmain families on the basis of their molecular mass, function as molecular chaperones, and the number of diseases that are known to be caused by their mutations are increasing (Muchowski and Wacker 2005). Accumulation of aggregation-prone proteins activates signal transduction pathways that control cell death and cell viability in various models of PD and HD.

In AD, in vitro studies and animal models suggest direct interaction between chaperones (HSP 28, 70, 72, etc.) with Aβ, which might regulate the formation of toxic Aβ assemblies. Cross-talk between chaperones and the UPS might be pivotal in regulating the deposition and toxicity of tau. HSP 70 and others interact with hyperphosphorylated tau in human brain, facilitate tau ubiquitination, enhance the levels of insoluble tau, and in vitro suppresses tau-induced cell death (Dou et al. 2003). In an in vivo model of PD in *Drosophila*, HSP 70 decreased the number of cells containing inclusion bodies, although with no effect on cell viability. It decreased insoluble high-molecular synuclein and suppressed its toxicity, suggesting that HSP 70 and others may have protective roles (Klucken et al. 2004). αSyn selectively interacts with the chaperone 14-3-3 in SN leading to a decrease of its available levels to inhibit apoptosis (Xu et al. 2002), while tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) activity is stimulated by 14-3-3, and inhibited by αSyn (Perez et al. 2002). αSyn itself has chaperone functions, assisting in folding and misfolding of many synaptic proteins (Uversky 2007).

In fALS, HSP 70 and other chaperones reduce the toxicity of mutant SOD-1, decrease its aggregation, and enhance survival. Overexpression of HSP 70 and 40 in the presence of mutant SOD-1 in a cell model results in synergistic reduction of aggregate formation (Takeuchi et al. 2002).

In polyQ diseases, the effect of chaperones can inhibit or delay htt aggregates, thus modulating ND in various animal models (Hay et al. 2004; Kimura and Kakizuka 2003).

It is likely that molecular chaperones facilitate neuroprotection by functioning at various levels not linked exclusively to their direct effects on protein aggregation, but they also may interfere with OS and—like the small heat shock protein Hsp27—may block apoptotic signaling pathways, thus promoting survival. Several chaperone actions might be required to impede tissue pathogenesis in vivo, and molecular chaperones may increasingly become new targets for the therapy of NDDs (Muchowski and Wacker 2005).

(Bossers et al. 2009; Dawbarn and Allen 2003) and dementias (Arancio and Chao 2007). Neurotrophins (NTF) regulate development and the maintenance of the vertebrate nervous system. They affect neuronal survival; influence synaptic function and plasticity, and are central to many aspects of the nervous system function. NTFs bind to different receptors, to a common receptor, and each of them also binds to one of the family of Trk receptors. By dimerization of the Trk receptors, and subsequent phosphorylation of the intracellular kinase domain, signaling pathways are activated. Since NTFs in neurons are subject to retrograde and, in some cases, to anterograde transport from and to targeting neurons, their effects may be related to synthesis in local or remote sites or to changes in axonal transport. Neurotrophic support is inversely correlated with OS (Gardiner et al. 2009). In CNS disorders, such as AD, PD and HD, OS appears inextricably linked to the loss of neurotrophic support, since OS can cause down-regulation of NTFs which, in turn, can up-regulate antioxidant enzymes and promote the expression of antioxidant proteins.

AD brain shows increase in NTF and decrease in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in surviving neurons of hippocampus and neocortex, and decrease of TrkA in cortex and nucleus basalis (Schindowski et al. 2008a). Aβ may induce the TrkA pathway activation directly by itself or indirectly promotes NGF secretion (Bulbarelli et al. 2009). Inhibition of soluble TNF signaling in a mouse model of AD prevents/slows pre-plaque amyloid-associated neuropathology, and potentially the progressive neuron “loss” in AD (McAlpine et al. 2009). Decreased retrograde transport of NGF in human brain and mouse models leads to loss of neuronal markers and shrinkage of neurons in the cholinergic basal forebrain, rather than due to decreased synthesis (Salehi et al. 2004). The selective vulnerability is putatively caused by their expression of the cell death mediator p75(NTR) (the common NTF receptor), and its interaction with proapoptotic ligands and APP (Fombonne et al. 2009). Recent studies in rodent and primate models of AD showed that BDNF prevents lesion-induced death of entorhinal neurons, reverses neuronal atrophy and ameliorates age-related cognitive impairment. Thus, BDNF exerts protective effects on cortical neural circuitry involving AD, acting through amyloid-independent mechanisms (Nagahara et al. 2009), indicating a prominent role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in both the etiology and treatment of AD.

In PD, decreased neuronal content of NFTs and their receptors in SN give evidence for a reduction of neurotrophic support and alterations in axon guidance in early stages of cellular stress, ultimately leading to dopaminergic cell death (Bossers et al. 2009). In HD, the mhtt induces a downregulation of BDNF in the basal ganglia, leading to

# Dysfunction of neurotrophins

There is growing evidence that reduced neurotrophic support is a significant factor in the pathogenesis of NDDsneuronal loss, opening up the possibility of BDNF therapy. Analyses of the BDNF isoforms show that transcription from BDNF promoter II and IV is down-regulated in human HD cortex from an early symptomatic stage. TrkB mRNA levels are reduced in caudate tissue but not in the cortex, whereas the mRNA levels of T-Shc (a truncated TrkB isoform) and p75(NTR) are increased in the caudate. This indicates that, in addition to the reduction in BDNF mRNA, there is also unbalanced neurotrophic receptor signaling in HD (Zuccato and Cattaneo 2007; Zuccato et al. 2008). In ALS, NGF concentrations and BDNF were strongly upregulated in early stages of the disease, whereas the levels of other NGFs gradually increased during the course of the disorder. In ALS spinal cords, TrkA was upregulated, but the results of trials in both animal models and human patients were controversial (Dawbarn and Allen 2003). Thus, comparative in situ data for transcription levels and protein contents in NTFs and their receptors in both sites of neuronal origin and termination in human brain are needed to understand their potential role in finding new treatment strategies (see Gardiner et al. 2009).

### "Neuroinflammatory" processes

Chronic inflammatory reactions and signs of immune activation in the CNS, with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II expression, glial reaction, and T-cell infiltration, and blood–brain-barrier (BBB) dysfunction are prominent pathological features in the pathogenesis and progression of NDDs including AD (Appel 2009; Eikelenboom et al. 2006; McGee and McGee 2005; Rojo et al. 2008; Schwab and McGee 2008; Stolp and Dziegielewska 2009; Zilka et al. 2009). AD “inflammation” has been considered toxic or, on the contrary, useful (Boche and Nicoll 2008). However, a better knowledge about the interplay between the nervous system and the local and systemic immune system will be important for the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms of ND (Piehl and Olsson 2009) and the role of innate “protective autoimmunity” (Schwartz et al. 2009) and of reparative functions of autoimmunity in NDDs (Graber and Dhib-Jalbut 2009).

Components related to AD neuroinflammation include microglia and astrocytes, the classic and alternate pathways of the complement system, the pentraxins, acute-phase proteins, neuronal-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (AChRs), peroxisomal proliferation-activated receptors (PPARs), as well as “pro-inflammatory” cytokines and chemokine. In animal models and human brains, both the microglia and astrocytes may generate Aβ, one of the main components of senile plaques, which, itself may act as a pro-inflammatory agent inducing the activation of glia and many of the inflammatory components (Bonifati and

Kishore 2007; Farfara et al. 2008; Sondag et al. 2009). The patterns of cytokine involvement strengthen the inflammatory theory of AD and raise a pathophysiologic role for selective alteration of cytokine network (Reale et al. 2008). Footprints of radicals and peroxynitrite attack have been detected in postmortem AD brain, which, at least in part, are produced by activated microglia, and, together with anomalous release of cytokines, may be a progression factor in AD (Block et al. 2007; Maccioni et al. 2009; Weisman et al. 2006). Complement activation exacerbates the pathology of AD, and complement is already overactivated without phagocytosis being observed. In both aged and AD brain and in several animal models, deposition of Aβ is likely to trigger inflammatory cascades with increased production of interleukins (IL-1-α and -β, IL-6), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-qmRN, αβ-macroglobulin, and complement proteins, part of which are localized in the Aβ plaques and in the surrounding activated astrocytes and microglia (Block et al. 2007; Schwab and McGee 2008; Streit 2004). Genetic studies of ApoE4, cytokine polymorphism and overexpression of inflammatory genes suggest that chronic inflammation may have adverse effects in AD. Increased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels and activated microglia and macrophages may be a compensation for defective clearance of Aβ (Fiala et al. 2007). Pro-inflammatory cytokine such as TNF play a role in cognitive processes and aging (McAfoose et al. 2009). Recent data suggest that JNK-AP1 signaling pathway is responsible for Aβ-induced neuroinflammation in cultured human brain endothelial cells and AD brain and that this signaling pathway may serve as a therapeutic target for relieving Aβ-induced inflammation (Vukic et al. 2009). Inflammation potentially increases brain levels of Aβ by three mechanisms: increased influx, decreased efflux, and increased neuronal production (Jaeger et al. 2009).

It has been suggested that immune alterations may occur prior to amyloid deposition and neuronal degeneration. In PSEN-1 mutant knock-in mice, calcium regulation is altered in neurons which makes them more vulnerable to Aβ excitotoxicity and apoptosis. On the other hand, several cytokines may serve neuroprotective functions, e.g., TNF-α mediates anti-apoptotic and antiexcitatory pathways, e.g., Mg-SOD and Bcl-2 inducing increased resistance to cell death (McGeer and McGeer 2005). On the other hand, aberrant tau can trigger microglia activation before tangle formation, but its precise relationship with neuroinflammation remains unclear (Zilka et al. 2009). It has been discussed whether AD pathology could be the outcome of the innate immunity defense in the brain (Salminen et al. 2009).

In PD, SNp cell degeneration is accompanied by astroglial reaction and proliferation of MHC class II positivemicroglia releasing pro-inflammatory cytokines, NO, complements, other substances mediating inflammatory reactions, and OS that may be both inducing factors or sequelae of neuronal death (Hald et al. 2007; Hirsch and Hunot 2009; Schwab and McGeer 2008). Recent research revealed numerous novel proteins that may be important in ND-mediated microglia activation in PD (Zhou et al. 2005). The pattern of humoral immune reactivity is consistent with an immune activation of microglia leading to the targeting of DA nigral neurons for the destruction in both idiopathic and genetic cases of PD (Gao et al. 2008; Orr et al. 2005). Parkin deficiency increases vulnerability to inflammation-related nigral degeneration (Frank-Cannon et al. 2008), while human neuromelanin induces neuroinflammation and degeneration in the rat SN (Zecca et al. 2008) and aggregated αSyn activates microglia (Zhang et al. 2005b). DA cell death is probably influenced by the innate immune system, and in an MPTP mouse model of PD T cell-mediated DAergic toxicity is almost exclusively arbitrated by CD4+ T cells and requires the expression of Fas/FasL but not the IFNγ cytotoxic pathway (Brochard et al. 2009). Progression of ND is thought to be driven by uncontrolled inflammation (Gao and Hong 2008). Demonstration of microglial activation and corresponding DAergic terminal loss in the affected nigrostriatal pathway in early PD supports that neuroinflammatory responses by intrinsic microglia contribute to the progressive degeneration in PD and related diseases (Kim and Joh 2006; Ouchi et al. 2005; Wilms et al. 2007).

Activated microglia may be both neurotoxic and neuroprotective, depending on several factors including aging, but the causes for transformation between the two actions remains largely unknown (Block and Hong 2005; Sawada et al. 2008). Microglia are cells that form the brain’s innate immune cell type, but also are associated with constant phagocytic clearance of cell debris. This process following injury represents an essential link between degeneration and regeneration. Insufficient clearance by microglia, present in several NDDs and declining with aging, is associated with an inadequate regenerative response (Neumann et al. 2009a). The problems of AD and tg animal models treated by immunotherapy causing plaque removal and increase in severity of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) (Boche et al. 2008; Boche and Nicoll 2008; Holmes et al. 2008; Prada et al. 2007; Wilcock et al. 2004; Wisniewski and Konietzko 2008) are not discussed here (see Foster et al. 2009).

Microglia activation that may play a major role in the pathogenesis of HD has been shown to correlate with severity of the disease, with a close spatial and temporal relationship to neuronal dysfunction (Pavese et al. 2006; Tai et al. 2007a), and has already been detected in presymptomatic HD gene carriers (Tai et al. 2007b).

### Neuronal death: the final pathway

The nature, time course, and molecular causes of cell death in NDDs and their relations to basic processes are still a matter of discussion. Based on distinct morphologic criteria and biochemical features, three major mechanisms of neuronal demise are discussed: apoptosis, a specific form of gene-directed programmed cell death (PCD); (oncotic) necrosis, a passive killing of the cell; and autophagic degeneration [for rev. see (Bredesen et al. 2006; Bredesen 2008; Gorman 2008; Jellinger 2006, 2007a; Okouchi et al. 2007)]. Morphologically, apoptotic cell death is characterized by chromatin condensation (pyknosis), nuclear fragmentation, cell shrinkage, and plasma membrane blabbing. Eventually, the cell breaks into small membrane-surrounded fragments (apoptotic bodies), which are cleared by phagocytosis in vivo without inciting an inflammatory response (Wyllie 1997), phagocytic activity being balanced by positive and negative signals (de Almeida and Linden 2005). Apoptosis can occur locally, without damaging healthy adjacent cells (Elmore 2007). This is in contrast to necrotic cell death, an accidental and uncontrolled mode of cell death, which exhibits rapid cell swelling and subsequent rupture of the plasma membrane that, due to an inflammatory response, usually induces substantial secondary cell damage in the surrounding tissue (Golstein and Kroemer 2007; Henriquez et al. 2008). Central to apoptotic cell death is the caspase family of proteases that are grouped on the basis of their activities into effector and initiator caspases [for rev. see (Ribe et al. 2008; Ribe Garrido et al. 2009)], while common players in necrotic cell death, irrespective of the stimulus, are calcium and ROS (Vanlangenakker et al. 2008). Many of the morphological differences between apoptotic and necrotic processes are thought to be a consequence of the action of cysteine proteases, and recent studies suggest that caspase and calpain functions in cell death are bridging the gap between apoptosis and necrosis (Mattson and Bazan 2006; Nicotera and Melino 2004). However, caspase-independent cell death also exists (Vila and Przedborski 2003). Autophagic cell death, more correctly cell death with autophagy rather than by autophagy (Kroemer and Levine 2008; Levine and Kroemer 2008), a normal physiological process active in both homeostasis and atrophy, probably representing a failure of neuroprotective mechanisms, is characterized by the formation of numerous autophagic vacuoles, endocytosis, enlargement of the GA as a source of lysosomes providing hydrolytic enzymes for the vacuolization of the ER, and moderate condensation of nuclear chromatin that may ultimately leave the pyknotic nuclei and is destroyed by autophagosomes (Winslow and Rubinsztejn 2008). Neuronal cell death may exhibit morphologic features of autophagy or necrosis, which differ
from that of canonical apoptosis or autophagic vacuolation can precede apoptotic cell death; this argues against the clear distinction between apoptotic and autophagic cell death (ACD) (Gonzalez-Polo et al. 2005; Uchiyama et al. 2009). Due to increasing interest in nonapoptotic PCD forms and the development of mammalian genetic tools to study autophagy, autophagic cell death has achieved major prominence, and is recognized now as a legitimate alternative death pathway to apoptosis (Gozuacik and Kimchi 2007). Recent data point to the existence of multiple non-apoptotic, regulated cell death mechanisms, some of which overlap or are mutually exclusive with apoptosis (Degterev and Yuan 2008). Although markers for autophagy have been identified in different NDDs (Klionsky et al. 2008), it is not yet possible to be certain that these are indicative of the occurrence of ACD (Galluzzi et al. 2008). Another cell death process is excitotoxic ND that has been described either as a necrotic or apoptotic process. Increasing evidence suggests that the regulation of neuronal cell death is complex, utilizing multiple pathways that are dependent on the damaging insult, such as Ca and intracellular energy levels, mitochondrial dysfunction, withdrawal of neurotrophic support, glutamate receptor stimulation, OS, NO release, and environmental stressors (Franco et al. 2009), each demonstrating specificity of function, regulation and pathway involvement, influenced by subtle differences among cell phenotypes (Gorman 2008; Ribe et al. 2008).

Cellular energy reserves play a crucial role in the major forms of cell death, with apoptosis favored under conditions with mild insults and preserved ATP levels; necrosis induced by spontaneous insults, such as ischemia, trauma, or excitotoxicity, with depletion of ATP and depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane potential, opening of the PTP, and release of cytochrome c, followed by depletion of energy reserves. Mitochondria are essential in controlling specific apoptotic pathways including release of a number of AIFs or death receptors, activators of the caspase/calpain, Bcl-2 and p53 families, and the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway that finally induce proteolysis of specific cellular substructures and consequently amplify the death signal cascade (Gorman 2008; Ribe et al. 2008; Roth 2001).

There are myriads of reasons and ways for a neuron to die, among which apoptosis is a specific form that is processed in two major signaling pathways, the TNF-receptor mediated (extrinsic) and the mitochondria-based (intrinsic) cell pathways, with several avenues of cross-talk between them (Fig. 8) (Faherty and Smeyne 2005). A cellular signaling network regulates necroptosis with a molecular bifurcation that controls apoptosis and necroptosis. Stimulation of death receptors by agonists such as FasL and TNFalpha activates apoptotic cell death in apoptotic-competent conditions or a type of necrotic cell death

dependent on RIP1 kinase, termed necroptosis, in apoptotic-deficient conditions (Hitomi et al. 2008). Similar death signaling pathways might be activated in NDDs by abnormal subcellular protein structures, cytoplasmic or nuclear fibrillar inclusions, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy deficits, neurotrophin deficiencies, and other factors. The key molecular players of apoptosis, the importance of the caspase cascade via interaction with different death domains, and the role of effective caspase driving the execution of the cell death program are summarized in Fig. 9. It seems that several levels of regulation are required in order to control the apoptotic pathway and to prevent neurons from dying. Misregulation of this pathway at any level will activate the apoptotic machinery finally leading to neuronal death, the most critical hallmark of many NDDs.

Although the various molecular players in apoptotic cell death are becoming increasingly known, whether or not they are involved or may interact with one another in the neuronal cell death cascade in various neurodegenerative processes is a matter of discussion (Cotman et al. 2005; Gorman 2008; Jellinger 2007a, b; Newman et al. 2005; Ribe et al. 2008; Spires-Jones et al. 2009; Welchman et al. 2005). Unfortunately, we lack detailed understanding of neuronal death pathways in almost all NDDs.

Challenges of apoptosis in neurodegeneration

General aspects

Implication of apoptosis as a general mechanism in many NDDs has largely been supported by evidence from animal models and tissue cultures, while studies in the human postmortem brain have yielded contradictory results. This may be explained by the fact that cell death

Caspases cleave many proteins by the activation of effector caspases by initiator caspases, but there may be substrate cleavage changing by activation of the substrate, that is converting a pro-apoptotic protein into an anti-apoptotic one and vice versa. Such events serve to amplify the signaling pathways leading to death or survival (Ribe et al. 2008). The molecular mechanisms of the biochemical cascades of apoptosis involve upstream effectors such as Par-4, p53 (regulating the expression of APP (Cuesta et al. 2009), and pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 family members, which mediate mitochondrial dysfunction and subsequent release of pro-apoptotic proteins, such as cytochrome *c* or apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), and subsequent caspase-dependent and -independent pathways which finally result in degradation of proteins and nuclear DNA (Krantic et al. 2007). The regulation of apoptotic cascades is complex and involves transcriptional control as well as posttranscriptional protein modifications, such as protease-mediated cleavage, ubiquitination or poly(ADP)-ribosylation. Regulation of protein phosphorylation by kinases and phosphatases is a prerequisite mechanism in the control of the apoptotic cell death program (Guo et al. 2006). In many of these conditions, mitochondrial dysfunction and the resulting ATP depletion may preclude caspase activation, and consequently switch execution of cell death towards necrosis. Recent evidence suggests a non-apoptotic caspase-associated form of cell death occurring in tauopathy (Spires-Jones et al. 2009).

In human postmortem brain NDDs, dying neurons are present, some of which display the features of apoptosis and increased expression of both pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins indicating a disturbed balance between these death-related factors which may be associated with incomplete cell-cycle activation in neurons, but recent studies comparing AD and normal aging brain, found no significant differences in the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (ARPs) and apoptotic morphology in cerebral cortex (Jellinger 2006; Woodhouse et al. 2006). On the other hand, a block of partial inhibition of the typical apoptotic demise may have profound implications in vivo, as persistence within the nervous system of damaged or “undead” cell, followed by delayed lysis may favor neuroinflammatory reactions. Caspases, the major regulatory enzymes of apoptosis, may be involved in loss of neurons, but not in the loss of connectivity that seems to initiate degeneration processes in the nervous system. Caspase-1 (Csp-1) is an upstream positive regulator of Csp-6-mediated cell death in primary human neurons. Its activation must be accompanied by an apoptotic insult to induce Csp-6-mediated cell death (Guo et al. 2006). Moreover, caspases can also contribute to processes that do not culminate in cell demise, and inhibition of caspases has cytoprotective effects. In a number of different models, caspase

is executed within a few hours (Roth 2001), whereas in most of these diseases, the neurodegenerative process leading to cell dysfunction and demise is an eminent chronic one. Thus, synchronous detection of a substantial number of apoptotic neurons at any given time point is extremely difficult, although some authors, based on currently available methods for the detection of apoptosis, i.e., the presence of morphologic markers (TUNEL/ISL staining associated with the expression of apoptosis-related proteins (ARPs), oncogenes, and other detectable player involved in the cascade of PCD), have reported variable incidence of apoptotic cell death in NDDs (Fadeel and Orrenius 2005; Jellinger 2006, 2007a, b; Kermeter et al. 2004). Such studies are further complicated by the fact that both DNA fragmentation and chemical apoptotic morphology can occur independently of apoptosis (Woodhouse et al. 2006).
inhibition does not maintain cellular viability and instead shifts the morphology of death from apoptosis to non-apoptotic pathways (Kim et al. 2006). The contribution of caspases to cell death, either as upstream signals or as downstream effectors, as well as alternative strategies for cell death inhibition have recently been reviewed (Ribe et al. 2008). Caspase-independent excision of chromatin loop domains represents a separate cell death pathway, which appears either in parallel or independently from caspase-dependent DNA fragmentation (Solovyan 2007). GABAergic striatal neurons exhibit caspase-independent, mitochondrially mediated PCD, reflecting differential interplay between caspase cascade and alternative cell death pathways (Diwakarla et al. 2009).

Such alternative strategies may either target catabolic hydrolases or aimed at preventing mitochondrial membrane permeabilization and its upstream triggers (Kroemer and Martin 2005). Analysis of PCD in neuronal demise has led to the identification of several associated phenomena, such as re-initiation of the cell cycle and the key role of OS. In acute and chronic neurodegenerative processes newly emerging concepts concerning cell-cycle re-initiation are discussed (Krantic et al. 2005).

Much evidence regarding mechanisms of cell death in NDDs comes either from in vitro cell culture systems or in vivo models using acute toxin exposure and/or genetic mutations found in disease. However, models are limited since they tend to examine the effect of one toxin or one gene on cell death, and they generally involve acute exposure to insults, which may not be relevant to the protracted degeneration observed in patients. Nevertheless, they have greatly increased our knowledge of the biochemical mechanisms of neuronal cell death in NDDs (Gupta et al. 2006; Ribe et al. 2008).

### Programmed cell death in Alzheimer and Parkinson disease

Discussion of the nature of neuronal loss in AD remains controversial (see Jellinger 2006, 2007a). Despite demonstration of DNA fragmentation and upregulation of pro-apoptotic and cell death regulator proteins, it is still unclear, whether apoptotic or necrotic modes are responsible for cell death. It is preceded by the activation of caspases and altered expression of pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl-2 family and other ARPs. Multiple caspases and elevated mRNA of caspases 1–3 and 5–9 have been detected in postmortem tissue from AD brains (Louneva et al. 2008; Rohn et al. 2002; Stadelmann et al. 1999), see (Ribe et al. 2008). However, this has been disputed by others who reported no apoptotic morphology in AD (Woodhouse et al. 2006). Although several survival signals may converge in tau-containing neurons (Hamdane et al.

(2003), the altered degradation and pathological aggregation of mutated protein, with consecutive activation of the apoptotic machinery linked to specific caspases, seem to be crucial for neuronal death in AD. However, there are other molecules, e.g., the Bcl-2 protein family, involved in the progression of the apoptotic cascade that are relevant to AD (Rohn et al. 2008).

Human postmortem AD brain compared to age-matched controls, showed a 30- to 50-fold increase of DNA fragmentation in neurons and glial cells, microglia and oligodendroglia being the most affected. Most of the TUNEL-positive neurons were seen in the temporal allocortex; only about 30% are located in or near Aβ deposits, but these were almost fivefold more frequent than degenerating neurons without context to plaques. NFTs involved around 40% of all degenerating neurons, which means a threefold increased risk of degeneration compared to tangle-free neurons (Lassmann et al. 1995). Other authors found nuclei adjacent to Aβ plaques to be almost non-apoptotic, and reported a significant negative correlation between the average number of NFTs in neocortex and the percentage of apoptosis-like nuclei (Woodhouse et al. 2006). Whereas, these data suggest that both AD lesions are not necessarily associated with cell death, co-localization of activated caspase-3 with 30% of senile plaques suggested that apoptosis may contribute to cell death resulting from amyloidosis and plaque formation. Despite large numbers of cells with DNA fragmentation particularly in the severely damaged hippocampus, only 0.02–0.05% of neurons display the morphology of apoptosis and show expression of ARPs and of activated caspase 3, the key enzyme of the terminal part of the apoptosis cascade (Louneva et al. 2008; Stadelmann et al. 1999). On the other hand, activated caspase-3 was detected in more than 50% of hippocampal neurons showing granulovacuolar degeneration, often co-localized with tau, suggesting a “pretangle” stage (Bancher et al. 1989), and the demonstration of elevated casein kinase 1 (CK-1) in both granulovacuolar bodies and NFT-bearing neurons and the co-localization of a cleavage product of APP suggest a link between both these lesions (Su et al. 2002).

Recent studies suggest relationships between loss of CB, Fas-associated death domain (FADD) enzyme expression, and phosphorylation of tau within the basal forebrain cholinergic neurons in AD (Wu et al. 2005). Increased expression of pro-apoptotic proteins and gene products, but also of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 family proteins and repair enzymes have been observed in AD brain (see Jellinger 2006), but there is a disturbed balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins associated with incomplete cell-cycle activation that may lead to elimination via apoptosis. Frequent DNA fragmentation and the “proapoptotic” environment in AD brain indicate increased vulnerabilityof neurons to metabolic and other noxious factors. Recent data suggest that the interaction between APP and/or Aβ and the cell death mediates p75 (NTR) (the common neurotrophin receptor) and its interaction with proapoptotic ligands cause a selective vulnerability of neurons in the cholinergic forebrain in APP (Fombonne et al. 2009). In surviving neurons, it can be suggested that viability is, in part, maintained by the lack of distal transmission of the caspase-mediated apoptotic signals. This phenomenon of apoptotic avoidance termed *abortive apoptosis* or *abortion*, may represent an exit from the caspase-induced death program (Raina et al. 2002). That, given the robust survivals of neurons with NFTs (Morsch et al. 1999; Schwab et al. 2009) and recent evidence that NFTs in experimental models do not directly correlate with neuron loss (Andorfer et al. 2005; SantaCruz et al. 2005) suggests that affected neurons may be able to withhold NFT formation for a long time before they degenerate. Despite a lack of clear evidence linking tau aggregates to neuronal loss, the presence of a tangle in a neuron is likely to be harmful, leading to changes in axonal transport and loss of synapses (Katsuse et al. 2006). Associations between tangle bearing neurons with caspase activation suggests that tangles are at least markers of neuronal disease (Spires-Jones et al. 2009). Thus, in NDDs, there may occur forms of cell death that are neither classical necrosis nor apoptosis with occasional autophagic degeneration (Levine and Yuan 2005). Although autophagy has been linked to models of AD, there is no evidence that this is part of a cell death pathway (Yu et al. 2005). Such factors are found in cells with abundant intracellular filaments or insoluble protein filaments in the cytoplasm (NFTs, LBs, tau-inclusions, Pick bodies, etc.), suggesting that such filaments may contribute to dysfunction or increased vulnerability of the involved cell but not necessarily to immediate cell demise (Jellinger 2006).

Recent data indicating a link between the development of Aβ and NFT/tau pathologies may be due to caspase activation and cleavage of APP which facilitate production of Aβ and by cleavage of tau may initiate or accelerate the development of tangle pathology (Cotman et al. 2005; Rohn and Head 2009; Troy and Ribe 2008). In several tg tau models, an increased number of TUNEL-positive neurons and ultrastructural features of both apoptosis and necrosis, but no activated caspases were observed (Andorfer et al. 2005; Schindowski et al. 2008b), while in aging PS/APP mice a crosstalk between apoptosis and autophagy was identified, which influences neuronal survival in AD-related ND (Yang et al. 2008a). However, many questions remain open about how changes in tau lead to ND and the relationship of NFT neuropathology to neuronal death, which recently is proposed to be a non-apoptotic caspase-associated form of death (Spires-Jones

Fig. 10 New steps and targets in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer disease. NGF and BDNF signaling through neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinases (NTRKs) (a) prevents the cleavage of APP by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1) (b). BACE1 together with γ-secretase (c) converts APP into a toxic amyloid-forming Aβ fragment (d) and a soluble n-terminal fragment (N-APP) (e). Possibly in AD, N-APP engages tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily, member 21 (TNFRSF21; DR6) (f), which activates caspase-6 apoptosis-related cysteine peptidase (CASP6; MCH2) and a related enzyme, CASP3 (CPP32) (g) to promote neuronal death (h). Modified from (Osherovich 2009)

et al. 2009). PSEN1 mutations, among the major causes of early-onset FAD, have been shown to accelerate the activation of initiator caspases and promote apoptosis, which may be associated, at least in part, with Aβ production (Miyoshi et al. 2009).

Aβ can cause neuronal apoptosis via caspase-dependent and caspase-independent pathways through multiple mechanisms involving mitochondria and ER as the key organelles, disorders of conformational dynamics and DNA integrity (Gharibyan et al. 2007). Most recent studies have suggested new steps and targets in the pathogenesis of AD (Fig. 10): NGF and BDNF signaling through neurotrophic tyrosine kinase (NTRK) prevent the cleavage of APP by β-site APP-cleaving enzyme (BACE1), which, together with γ-secretase, converts APP into toxic forming Aβ fragments, and a soluble N-terminal fragment (N-APP). This extracellular fragment of APP, and death receptor G (DRG) activating a widespread caspase-dependent self-destructing process (via caspase-6), might be a major culprit behind AD (Nikolaev et al. 2009; Osherovich 2009). This proapoptotic pathway proposed by these data may be relevant for other NDDs, such as PD and HD, or other brain injuries. In HD and its mouse models, increase in Bax expression is suggested to be related to an apoptotic induction which contributes to the disease progression (Teles et al. 2008).

Cell death is a significant part of the pathology of PD. Although the process is mysterious, the prime suspect for a

toxic protein is αSyn and its aberrant forms, including increased expression of the normal gene (Cookson 2009). Whether PCD actually occurs within the human PD brain remains controversial, and this possibility has been neither confirmed by numerous studies nor definitely excluded (Jellinger 2006; Tatton et al. 2003). Apoptosis may be involved in PD, although the molecular mechanisms that initiate dopaminergic neuron loss are not known. These include JNK signaling, p53 activation, cell-cycle reactivation, and signaling through Bcl-2 proteins (Levy et al. 2009). Previous studies in both human postmortem PD brain and MPTP-treated mice suggest that activated Csp-3 and -8 represent both vulnerability factors and final effectors in apoptotic death of DAergic neurons (Hartmann et al. 2001a; Turmel et al. 2001), with Bax as a probable cofactor in Csp activation, but could not confirm a control role of Bax in apoptotic death of DA neurons in an experimental PD paradigm (Hartmann et al. 2001b). Postmortem analysis can bridge some but not all of our knowledge gaps; the results are still controversial, and we need a better understanding of the molecular basis and pathways that drive the yin-yang between neuronal survival and death.

### Conclusions

On the basis of currently available data, it has to be stated that, although many in vitro and in vivo studies favor apoptosis in AD, PD, and other NDDs, the majority of human brain tissue studies have yielded mixed or controversial results and there is increasing evidence for alternative mechanisms of neuronal demise. Despite increased sensitivity of specific neuronal populations due to a pro-apoptotic environment in the brain, the death cascade introduced by many noxious factors may be counteracted by other cellular mechanisms which limit the activation of various apoptotic triggers, suppress oxyradicals, and stabilize calcium homeostasis and mitochondrial function (Fig. 11). The role of various cellular processes, including abnormal protein degradation and aggregation, within the course of cellular dysfunction and neuronal death needs to be further elucidated. Despite considerable progress in the clarification of the molecular mechanisms of cell degeneration in NDDs, the intracellular cascade leading to cell dysfunction and, finally, to neuronal death in these chronic progressive disorders remains to be elucidated. Better understanding of the molecular pathology and causative mechanisms of ND may provide better insight into the pathogenesis of these diseases and lead to development of future protective strategies and novel approaches for the effective treatment of these hitherto deleterious disorders.

These include therapy with chaperones, small molecules that inhibit protein aggregation, and in enforcement of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway. Furthermore, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and inflammation can be addressed. MAP-kinases may prove to be a promising target. To interfere only with the execution of cell death (necrosis, apoptosis) may be too late to restore the function of neurons.
