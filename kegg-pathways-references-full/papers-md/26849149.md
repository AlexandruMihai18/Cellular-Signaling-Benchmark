Running title: Endocrine resistance in breast cancer

Abstract

In the majority of women, breast cancer progresses through increased transcriptional activity due to over-expressed estrogen receptor (ER). Therapeutic strategies include a) reduction of circulating ovarian estrogen or of peripherally produced estrogen (in postmenopausal women) with aromatase inhibitors and b) application of selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) for receptor blockade. Success of these interventions is limited by the variable but persistent onset of acquired resistance and by intrinsic refractiveness which manifests despite adequate levels of ER in about 50% of patients with advanced metastatic disease.

Loss of functional ER leads to endocrine insensitivity, loss of cellular adhesion and polarity, and increased migratory potential due to trans-differentiation of the epithelial cancer cells into a mesenchymal-like phenotype (EMT). Multiple mechanisms contributing to therapeutic failure have been proposed: a) loss or modification in ER expression including epigenetic mechanisms b) agonistic actions of SERMs that may be enhanced through increased expression of co-activators c) attenuation of tamoxifen metabolism through expression of genetic variants of P450 cytochromes that leads to more or less active metabolites d) increased growth factor signaling particularly through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR/erbB2) activation of pathways involving keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF/abl) and nuclear factor kB (NFkB). In addition, the small non-coding microRNAs, recently recognized as critical gene regulators, exhibit differential expression in tamoxifen sensitive vs resistant cell lines. Several studies suggest the potential of using these either as targets, or as

therapeutic agents, to modulate EMT regulators, as a means of reversing the
aggressive metastatic phenotype by reversal of EMT, with the added benefit of re-
sensitisation to anti-estrogens.

Introduction

Estrogen, acting through the estrogen receptor (ER), in conjunction with progesterone and other hormones, is responsible for the normal physiology of the female sex organs, but when a woman develops a neoplasm in her breast then it assumes an undesired role. Indeed, ER status is a major prognostic indicator and is considered to be the primary predictor of response to endocrine therapy [1-4].

Therapy of breast cancer, in women whose tumors over-express the ER, is based largely on reduction of circulating or locally synthesized estrogen, or on receptor blockade with selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) such as tamoxifen [5]. Unfortunately, in addition to the approximately 20-30% of women with clinically ER-ve tumors who will not respond to endocrine agents due to the lack of a target, a significant proportion of ER+ve patients also exhibit *de novo* resistance to anti-estrogens [6]. In, especially the latter case, encountering early ‘refractiveness’ may simply reflect the failure of the staging process to accurately determine the likelihood of success with endocrine intervention and should be clearly recognized as such. In order to improve the stratification process there is now the opportunity to perform additional phenotyping such as those afforded by the Oncotype DX and MapQuant DX screens [7]. These are claimed to indicate distinct groups with differential prognosis. The vast majority of initially responsive patients eventually acquire resistance [8]. Post-menopausal women, may benefit from brief periods of remission with aromatase inhibitors (to block peripheral estrogen production) or other alternative therapies given post-SERM therapy, but most patients experience a relapse and eventually die from metastatic disease [9, 10].

Much effort has been expended to understand the molecular mechanisms of this specific
mode of drug resistance, in order to find ways to overcome it. Early expectations that it could be explained solely by loss of ER expression [11] have not been borne out *per se*. Observations from studies utilizing cell lines that have been manipulated to lose estrogen sensitivity or acquire anti-estrogen resistance, have led to the detailed description of a number of cellular processes that could be responsible for the defense of the cancer cell [12, 13]. These are listed in table 1, either as associated with a metabolic response, or a structural or functional alteration of the receptor. It should be appreciated that resistance by the cancer cell, to therapies aimed at antagonizing the action of estrogen, is effected by making estrogen (and therefore anti-estrogens) irrelevant. This can be achieved either by abrogating the need for estrogen for receptor activation, leading to enhanced ER constitutive activity, or by activating estrogen/ER independent growth pathways. This review presents a brief overview of these mechanisms, which have been discussed in much detail elsewhere in the literature [1–4, 6, 10], and then propose two other processes (epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and miRNA dysregulation) whereby the cancer cell may escape from the confines of endocrine control. Addressing these, offers a promising new approach to combating endocrine resistance. All reference to ER in this review refers specifically to ERα unless indicated otherwise.

### Estrogen receptor mutations

The ER status is the primary predictor of response to hormonal therapy, with loss of expression accounting for *de novo* resistance [14]. Missense mutations in ER genes [15] have been found to result in constitutive ligand independent activation and hypersensitivity [16]. Several recent studies have shown that ER mutations in the ligand
binding domain may confer endocrine resistance [17, 18] and this may well be due to

clonal expansion of rare mutant clones [19] Acquisition of resistance during the course

of therapy can be attributed to epigenetic changes in the ER gene that modulate

transcription (e.g. aberrant methylation of the CpG islands of the ER promoter, as well as

histone deacetylation) [20, 21].

Treatment of ER-ve cells with inhibitors of histone deacetylase (HDAC) such as

trichostatin A (TSA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) was reported not only

to restore ER expression, but also to re-sensitize cells to endocrine therapy [22, 23].

Moreover, SAHA has been found to reduce EGFR expression and down-regulate the

activity of downstream effector molecules such as AKT and p38MAPK [24]. In addition,

both in vitro and in vivo studies have documented the role of HDAC inhibitors in up-

regulating aromatase expression, which can ultimately restore sensitivity to anti-estrogens

[25, 26].

### Growth factor stimulated pathways

Phosphorylation of sites within the transactivation and DNA binding domains of the ER

can occur without the binding of estrogen, thereby transforming the receptor into a

constitutively activated form [27] abrogating the requirement for estrogen. Evidence

from a variety of experimental settings shows that several growth factor receptors such as

EGFR, HER-2, IGF-1R and/or their downstream signaling molecules may be involved in

direct ER phosphorylation in the absence of estrogen binding, effectively rendering the

presence of tamoxifen irrelevant [14, 28] (fig. 1).

Mutations and amplifications in the HER family, resulting in un-regulated activation, are
found in a proportion of solid tumors, and have been implicated in cancer progression

[29]. The crosstalk between ER and HER-2 is mediated both through the PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway that is frequently de-regulated in breast cancer, as well as the Ras-Raf-MEK MAPK pathway [30, 31], leading to enhanced proliferation and survival of malignant cells that mediate resistance to endocrine therapy [32]. The PI3K-Akt pathway leads to ER phosphorylation at certain serine residues resulting in ligand-independent ER activation [33]. Additionally the Akt negative regulator phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN) is generally inactive in endocrine resistant breast cancer cells [13]. HER2 was also found to increase the expression of the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2, leading to enhanced cancer cell survival and estrogen-independent proliferation [34].

Crosstalk between ER and IGF-1R involves activation of the IGF-1R substrates IRS-1 and IGF-II by the ER and the reciprocal activation of ER through the ability of IGF-1R to phosphorylate ER at certain serine residues [35].

In many pre-clinical studies the use of specific growth factor receptor inhibitors as a beneficial strategy against endocrine resistance have been reported. For instance inhibition of EGFR re-sensitizes endocrine resistant cells to the inhibitory effect of tamoxifen [13]. The monoclonal antibody trastuzumab (Herceptin) that specifically binds HER-2 was found to attenuate endocrine resistant breast cancer proliferation [30]. The supplementation of such blockers to aromatase inhibitors or tamoxifen has been suggested to provide a better clinical outcome compared to single agent therapy [36]. The IGF-1R-specific inhibitors lower the basal phosphorylation levels of IGF-1R, EGFR and Akt, as well as hindering growth in resistant cells [14]. Moreover, combining PI3K pathway inhibitors with tamoxifen enhances its pro-apoptotic effect, with improvedclinical outcome as compared to application of either agent alone [37]. Other combinations that have proved effective are the aromatase inhibitor letrozole and the rapamycin analog, RAD001, or the PI3K and mTOR inhibitor, NVP-BEZ235, or the Akt inhibitor for patients that develop resistance to letrozole [37, 38].

Therefore, the use of combination therapy utilizing endocrine agents and inhibitors of specifically up-regulated molecules represents a potential therapeutic strategy by which endocrine resistance might be prevented or overcome.

Other signaling pathways involving NOTCH and NFkB also control the expression of genes implicated in endocrine resistance [39]. NFkB expression levels are elevated in ER-ve breast cancer cells, while markedly reduced in ER+ve cells [14] and it is known to engage in crosstalk with ER [40] and regulate its activity, thus interfering with the response of ER+ve cells to endocrine therapy [41]. NFkB has been reported by several groups to be over-expressed in endocrine resistant breast tumours [42-44]. This is interesting in view of its role in the inflammatory cascade [45]

### Pharmacologic tolerance of tamoxifen

Another mechanism of endocrine resistance is related to how the drug (e.g. tamoxifen) is distributed and metabolized within the patient's body. This is regulated through the action of various enzymes. Tamoxifen is metabolized by cytochrome P450 (CYP450) to several compounds. Some of these actually exhibit estrogen-like activity and would therefore accelerate onset of endocrine resistance. Others possess enhanced anti-estrogenic properties; endoxifen (4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl tamoxifen) is the most potent tamoxifen metabolite (with 100-fold higher affinity to ER than tamoxifen) [46, 47]. The generation of endoxifen is dependent on CYP2D6, for which several allelic variants havebeen reported [48]. Some of these variants have reduced activity, resulting in reduction  
of the formation of endoxifen, which lessens the antagonistic effect of tamoxifen, thereby  
allowing a greater degree of drug resistance in such women as compared with those with  
the wild-type alleles generating the most active CYP2D6 enzyme. Another reason for  
lower intra-tumoral endoxifen concentrations in women with acquired resistance is  
increased efflux mediated through the action of various membrane pumps, such as the P-  
glycoprotein [47]. Mechanisms by which such pumps are over-expressed include over-  
expression of the nuclear receptor PXR (in response to extended exposure to tamoxifen)  
that can enhance expression of P-glycoprotein, ultimately increasing endoxifen efflux  
from tumor cells. Ahmed et al. [49] suggested the administration of oral endoxifen to  
patients to counter drug efflux correlated with tamoxifen treatment.

### Expression of ERβ

The discovery of a second distinct receptor binding to estrogen (ERβ; [50]), has led to  
much speculation regarding the relationship between the two forms. However, there is  
still lack of clarity as to the precise role of ERβ. It is generally thought to be less  
expressed in malignant cells as compared to normal mammary cells [51], hence  
indicating a role for ERβ as a tumor suppressor, as it was shown to reduce the  
proliferation effect of ERα, leading to hormonal therapy resistance [52, 53]. It may  
influence ERα activity (thereby affecting clinical outcome) by forming heterodimers.  
Nonetheless, it has been suggested that ERβ could contribute to endocrine resistance  
through mediating an agonistic, rather than an antagonistic effect of tamoxifen if  
transcription of target genes is mediated through the AP-1 site, rather than an ER  
responsive element site [54]. Thus, the particular role that ERβ plays during endocrine  
resistance still needs further investigation.

**Altered ER co-regulatory recruitment**

The ER co-regulatory molecules are ER-associated proteins that regulate the transcriptional activity of the ER, and can be either co-activators or co-repressors. Changes in the level of these co-regulatory proteins can influence the relative balance of action of a mixed agonist/antagonist such as tamoxifen [55]. For instance, AIB-1 is among the most common co-activators found to be upregulated in over 50% of breast carcinomas. Webb et al. [56] showed that AIB-1 induces the agonistic, instead of the antagonistic activity of tamoxifen. On the other hand, the co-repressor N-CoR is correlated with tamoxifen sensitivity as it recruits histone deacetylase that leads to chromatin condensation, and the subsequent inhibition of gene transcription. Lavinsky et al. [57] reported a decrease in the transcriptional levels of N-CoR in breast cancer cells resistant to endocrine therapy. Thus, progressive loss of co-repressor activity during the course of endocrine therapy may be a predominant mechanism by which an acquired resistant phenotype might develop.

**Tumor microenvironment**

The progression of malignancy, which is characterized by the conversion of cells into more invasive, motile entities resistant to hormonal therapy, depends to a great extent on its interaction with the surrounding microenvironment [58]. Among other molecules, much attention has been focused on integrins [59] as their downstream mediators; particularly FAK, MAPK, and PI3K [60] are involved in endocrine resistance. Integrin-activated FAK was found to further facilitate signaling cross-talk between integrin and several growth factor receptors that have been implicated with enhancement of endocrine

resistance in breast cancer (e.g. c-erbB2) [61].

Stress is also known to enhance endocrine resistance through the up-regulation of stress-related mediators, such as heat shock proteins (Hsp) and p38 MAPK [62, 63]. During endocrine resistance, Hsp90, Hsp70 and Hsp27 play a role in chaperoning the mutated and over-expressed HER-2/neu, c-Src, and IGFR-1, aiding in the emergence of treatment-resistant tumor cells that are significantly dependent on these Hsp's for maintaining high levels of such oncogenes [64]. On the other hand, p38 stimulates endocrine resistance through its phosphorylation of ERα, which enhances interaction with co-activators, specifically increasing AIB-1 activity, which leads to the ER ligand-independent transactivation [65].

Clinical correlates

Assessment of factors responsible for resistance are difficult to evaluate in a clinical setting. Where the primary tumour has been excised there is no opportunity for post-treatment molecular analysis. Measuring treatment response also relies on monitoring survival and relapse which may be a consequence of inherent tumour aggressiveness as opposed to acquisition of therapy resistance [66, 67]. However, in the neoadjuvant setting, where the primary tumour remains in situ, there is opportunity to measure tumour growth with ultrasound or mammography and even the possibility of more than one biopsy to assess gene expression [68] pre and post treatment to relate to clinical response.

Several treatment strategies have employed either combination therapy with antiestrogen and aromatase inhibitor to overcome resistance [69, 70] or augmentation of endocrine agents with anti-human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) receptor monoclonal antibodies [71]. The mTOR inhibitor everolimus and EGFR inhibitor gefitinib [72, 73]

can overcome resistance mediated through the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway. Metastatic breast cancer patients have been reported to benefit from combinations of everolimus and fulvestrant following relapse on aromatase inhibitors [74].

### Epithelial to mesenchymal transition

Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) was first identified as a developmental process, in which cells of an epithelial phenotype converted into cells with mesenchymal characteristics, with significant reduction in cell adhesion points, as well as increased cell migration capacity [75]. EMT is now generally accepted as a prominent hallmark of cancer progression [76].

The EMT is driven by several regulatory networks (examples are illustrated in fig. 2), which include a number of nuclear transcription factors. Translational control of proteins involved in EMT is also regulated by the expression of various small non-coding RNA molecules (microRNA; miRNA). Proteins that have been linked to the transcriptional control of EMT are SNAIL, SLUG, TWIST, ZEB1, ZEB2, E47, FOXC2 and Krüppel-like factor 8 (KF8) [77]. They can mediate EMT through binding directly (e.g. SNAIL and ZEB), or indirectly (e.g. TWIST, FOXC2) to the promoter region of E-cadherin, repressing its expression [78]; this being one of the key characteristics of epithelial cells that is lost during EMT. They also modulate expression of other junction proteins such as claudins and desmosomes leading to trans-differentiation of epithelial cells into mesenchymal-like cells [79]. Several signaling pathways are linked to the activation of EMT transcription factors, particularly through RTK and integrin pathways, activating downstream signaling molecules such as Src, MAPK, PI3K, Akt and FAK, leading to enhanced SNAIL expression [80, 81].
Besides transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, general translational mechanisms have been found to regulate EMT. An example is the enhancement of ZEB and TWIST by the Y-Box binding protein 1 (YB-1) [82]. Moreover, GSK3β [83], is involved in the maintenance of epithelial differentiation through its ability to phosphorylate SNAIL, targeting it for degradation [84]. Conversely, its downregulation can lead to EMT. Additionally, a number of MMPs have been linked to the stabilization of EMT through their modulation of several signal transduction pathways [77]. In addition, inflammatory responses that are associated with most stages of tumour development [85] have also been implicated as a key inducer of EMT. SNAIL may also induce the expression of pro-inflammatory interleukins (IL-1, IL-6 and IL-8) [86].

A recent paper [87] describes studies with knock-in reporter mouse lines which show that normal gland-reconstituting mammary stem cells as well as tumour initiating cells can undergo distinct EMT programmes under the influence of SNAIL and SLUG.

### Epithelial to mesenchymal transition and endocrine resistance

Development of endocrine insensitivity has been observed in several studies on manipulated cancer cell lines with characteristics similar to those of cells undergoing EMT, indirectly indicating a link between the two processes [88, 89]. Moreover, several growth factor receptors (e.g., EGFR, IGF-1R and FGFR1), which are highly expressed in ER-ve cells, are involved in the EMT process, indicating another link between EMT and endocrine resistance. The c-erbB2 receptor is associated both with acquisition of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells [90], and with EMT [91]. Expression of E-cadherin is inhibited in cells over-expressing c-erbB2, resulting in reduction of cell adherence, and gradual loss of epithelial morphology and architecture. Moreover,EGFR/c-erbB 2 over-expression was observed to be localized to sites of membrane protrusion and shape change, leading to a motogenic phenotype, through engagement with a pathway linking it to the actin cytoskeleton of cancer cells [92].

The first evidence of a direct link between endocrine insensitivity and EMT came from in vitro studies performed in our laboratory on ER-depleted cells. The enforced loss of ER expression by shRNA transfection was found to convert the non-invasive epithelial MCF-7 cell line into a more mesenchymal-like phenotype displaying highly invasive characteristics [12, 93]. Independently derived ER-silenced lines, using different vectors, and variously designated as pII, YS2.5 and IM26, all display remarkably similar features; resembling basal-like metaplastic and claudin/occludin-low tumor subtypes, that have lost their luminal cell markers. Typically, they all exhibit ‘cadherin switching’: down-regulation of E-cadherin and up-regulation of mesenchymal N-cadherin (also described by Iseri et al. [89] for their drug resistant MCF7 lines), with enhanced MMP production and secretion. Conversion of the cell's structural intermediate filament system from a keratin-based into a vimentin-rich network is clearly reminiscent of cells undergoing EMT. pII cells show close similarity to the tumor-derived ER-ve MDA-MB-231 cell line, which is generally regarded as being mesenchymal-like. EMT mediates endocrine resistance through the action of the EMT-transcription mediators SNAIL and SLUG. Dhasarathy et al. [94] reported the direct repression of ERα expression by SNAIL. SLUG on the other hand, was reported to be over-expressed in a Src-dependent manner in malignant breast cancer cells, and was documented to enhance the anti-apoptotic behavior of cancer cells, aiding in resistance to anti-cancer therapy [95]. Furthermore, the collective consequence of the action of such transcription factors (i.e. E-cadherin

14
loss), leading to lower intracellular adhesion, enhanced invasion and motility, was

development of endocrine resistance [96].

Hence, EMT has emerged as a major mediator of endocrine resistance in breast cancer cells [97, 98]. Interestingly, several recent studies have attempted to reverse EMT as a therapeutic strategy to prevent the development of metastatic tumors. For example, in a preclinical study by Yoshida et al. [99] it was found that the anti-tumor effect of the microtubule inhibitor, eribulin, was facilitated by stimulating the reversal of EMT; a mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) in resistant breast cancer cells. Khan et al. [100] recently proposed an oral contraceptive (centchroman), as a candidate drug to prevent breast cancer metastasis, by virtue of its ability to reverse EMT. Administration of a TGF-β inhibitor together with doxorubicin was reported to produce a significantly better clinical outcome than seen with doxorubicin alone [101]. Thus, there is considerable interest in designing strategies for overcoming endocrine resistance that are based on the principle of reversing EMT as a means of re-sensitizing the tumor cells to anti-estrogens.

### MicroRNAs and epithelial to mesenchymal transition

#### miRNA and cancer progression

A particular mRNA can be targeted by one or several miRNAs, and a single miRNA can target several mRNAs [109] suggesting a highly integrated network of connections synchronizing the phenotype of a cell (some examples are illustrated in fig. 3).

Observations of dysregulation in the expression of miRNAs in cancer have been variously correlated with chromosomal instability, mutations and polymorphisms, epigenetic alterations in coding genes, promoter methylation, or modifications in

transcription factor activity [110, 111]. Although some miRNAs show increased expression (oncogenic) [112], it appears that the majority are downregulated in cancer cells and are regarded as tumor suppressors [113, 114]. The interesting point is that miRNAs can be viewed, both as prognostic or therapy markers (e.g., detection in blood; [115]), as well as therapeutic targets [116, 117]. Moreover, exogenous miRNA can be used as a therapeutic strategy (discussed further below).

Altered expression of several miRNAs has been implicated in endocrine resistance in breast cancer [118, 119]. Interestingly, a significant number of miRNAs have been particularly linked to EMT through modulation of target mRNAs that play an important role in this process, presenting a new mechanism by which EMT can be modulated.

### miRNAs regulate EMT and hence influence endocrine resistance

Several miRNAs (miRNA-9, -24, -29, -29a, -103/107, -16b-25, -155 and -221/222) have been reported to convert breast cancer cells from their epithelial morphology into a more mesenchymal phenotype [120]. For instance, miRNA-9, upregulated in cancer cells [118], induced a mesenchymal appearance coincident with reduction in E-cadherin and a parallel increase in vimentin [121]. miRNA-221/222, described in various reports as mediators of breast cancer progression, were found to be lower in HER2-ve/ER+ve vs HER2+ve/ER-ve cells, as well as inhibiting ER protein expression [122]. Several studies have observed an association between the development of endocrine resistance and overexpression of miRNA-221/222 [123-125]. Elevated miRNA-221/222 leads to downregulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27<sup>kip1</sup>, enhancement of β-catenin activation, and suppression of ER expression, which ultimately leads to endocrine resistance.

contrary report Pandey and Picard [126], whilst observing a repressive effect of miR-22, failed to find any repression of ER expression following miRNA-221/222 over-expression. Indeed, they observed a positive correlation with miRNA-221/22 and also miR-219 up-regulating the ER 3'UTR. They were unable to reconcile these differences with the earlier reports. Yet another study, by Zhao et al. [123], reported a suppression of ER protein expression but not mRNA following miRNA-221/222 transfection into MFC 7 cells, while the knockdown of such miRNAs partially restored ER protein expression in ER-ve cells. Clearly, further investigations are needed to determine the effect of miRNA-221/222 in ER mRNA and protein regulation, which will help to determine the functional role of such miRNAs and their usefulness in breast cancer therapy.

A number of other miRNAs have been implicated in EMT reversal. These include miR-7, -124, -145, -200 family and -205, -375, and -448 [120, 127].

In vivo studies have shown reduced invasion and lung metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells with elevated miR-124 expression [128]. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have attributed the anti-invasive capacity of miR-124 to its ability to target the 3' UTR region of SLUG reducing its expression [129], while also enhancing E-cadherin levels, or to the targeting of flotillin-1 (FLOT1), RhoG, or ROCK [130, 135].

Similarly, miR-145 over-expression also inhibits EMT by reducing ZEB1/2 and SNAIL expression levels while enhancing E-cadherin expression [136]. Direct links have been reported between negative regulators of EMT, SOX2 and KLF4, and miRNA-145 [137, 138]. miRNA-145 also enhanced EMT reversal through targeting of Oct4.

These and several preclinical studies clearly indicate that miRNA mediated reversal of EMT, utilizing an endogenous pathway, could be an effective therapeutic strategy for

breast cancer patients with metastatic disease.

miRNAs in cancer proliferation and invasion

Besides their role in EMT, several miRNAs (e.g. miR-10b, -21, -27a, -221/222, -301a, -495) have been linked to either enhancement [120, 135] or inhibition (e.g. miR-22, -31, -93, -145, -206, -335, -486-p, -769-3p) of cancer proliferation and metastasis [120].

Both miR-21 and -221/222 are involved with cancer progression through up-regulation of HER2 and MAPK [109], and inhibition of p27<sup>kip1</sup> and PTEN [120, 136, 137]. Conversely, miR-124 over-expression is also associated with reduced cancer proliferation as it causes cell cycle arrest at G<sub>0</sub> and G<sub>1</sub> [138]; its anti-proliferative effect being mediated by targeting the E26 transformation specific-1 gene (ETS). miRNA-145 has an anti-metastatic effect mediated through the reduced expression of JAM-A and fascin, both of which have been reported to enhance migration capacities of cancer cells [139, 140]. It also suppresses the mucin 1 gene leading to down-regulation of β-catenin and cadherin-11 [141].

Therapeutic utility of miRNAs

Several miRNAs have been described as markers for distant metastases in both ER+ve [1142], and in triple negative breast cells [143, 144], and some (miR-128a and -210) for disease-free survival [145, 146]. They are also potentially useful as markers for therapeutic response to tamoxifen in advanced ER+ve patients or to trastuzumab treatment in ER-ve patients [147, 148].

miRNA-based drugs could also be used either to target specific oncogenes (to suppress their expression) or replace down-regulated miRNAs that function as tumor suppressors.

The ability of some miRNAs to simultaneously target several different mRNA molecules
is also an attractive feature for treatment of multifactorial diseases [149]. Of course, on the flip side, the pleiotropic nature of these miRNAs means that greater care needs to be exercised to identify any undesired potential targets.

### miRNA mimics

With the increasingly rapid identification and sequencing of the miRNA population of many cell types, a large number of miRNA mimics are now commercially available. Thus miRNAs that are downregulated in breast tumors may be restored to normal levels by introduction of such constructs (i.e., replacement therapy). These mimics would have the same sequence as the absent naturally occurring miRNA. Typically, they may be introduced through viral or liposomal delivery [150] as with other nucleic acids.

### Antagomirs

Antagomirs are small oligonucleotides that inhibit the miRNA-target mRNA interaction by binding to the appropriate miRNA molecules [151-153]. For example, the anti-miR-21 oligonucleotide was found to suppress the growth and migration effects of miR-21 in both ER+ve and ER-ve cells *in vitro*, and also suppressed tumor growth in xenograft mouse models *in vivo* [1154, 155]. Moreover, this anti-miR-21 also restored breast cancer sensitivity to topotecan and taxol. Combination therapy with both anti-miR-21 and taxol achieved a 50% therapeutic reduction in cancer cell viability and invasion over taxol alone [155].

Prior to clinical usage, it is also important to determine the extent, if any, of interaction with conventional drugs. To date, the most developed miRNA-based agent is anti-miR-122 used for the treatment of hepatitis C infection [156].
miR masks

miR masks are a range of oligonucleotide compounds currently under development that are designed to bind to either a specific miRNA or to its target mRNA. The miR masks that bind to a target mRNA would potentially prevent the binding of a specific miRNA seed family, thus preventing only one miRNA from interacting with its target mRNA [94].

The different treatment strategies mentioned above are illustrated in fig. 4

Conclusion

Endocrine resistance presents as a highly complex network of events that requires multiple therapeutic interventions to combat it. In addition to the now well-trodden linear strategies of inhibiting growth factor receptors that appear to propagate resistance (with monoclonal antibodies and small molecule inhibitors), the increasing evidence linking resistance with EMT provides possibilities for a different approach. In this case, the aim is to reverse EMT and force the cell back to an epithelial phenotype, with reduced migratory capacity and possibly re-sensitised to anti-estrogens. This may be achieved either with the application of synthetic antagomiRs to block action of endogenous miRNAs that restrict expression of epithelial genes or miRs that can down-regulate specific EMT mediators to suppress or reverse the mesenchymal-like phenotype typical of metastasizing cells.

Mechanisms of endocrine resistance. Various molecules are integrated in a complex network each playing a role in the development of hormonal therapy resistance in breast cancer. RTKs, with their down-stream signaling molecules (e.g. FAK, Src, Akt, PI3K) promote membrane estrogen-independent ER phosphorylation leading to constitutive activation, to induce a more invasive and malignant phenotype. Loss/reduction of ERβ can also lead to increased ERα promoted activation. Other cell signaling receptors such as integrins contribute through synergizing the action of RTKs, and activation of FAK. Environmental stress leads to high expression of Hsp's and p38 which both enhance resistance by maintaining high levels of RTKs and over-expression of ER co-activator molecules which stimulate ER signaling. Endocrine resistance can also be due to loss/mutation of ER by promotion of EMT through mediators such as SNAIL. ERα can also be down regulated by specific miRNA. Tamoxifen metabolism to its more active metabolite endoxifen can be reduced by lower activity of CYP2D6 enzyme variants, as well as by increased efflux through an up-regulated P-glycoprotein pump. TAM: tamoxifen, ENDOX: Endoxifen, Co-A: co-activator.

Fig. 2.

EMT is determined by various molecular events; examples are illustrated. Most commonly, several groups of transcription factors can act to down regulate epithelial markers such as E-cadherin. Regulation of such transcription factors by molecules such as YB-1 can sustain EMT. Conversely, miRNAs can block EMT by targeting its mediators.
Fig. 3.

Integrated miRNA network. miRNAs can be involved in a complex network where they can target the same or different mRNAs affecting different processes. miRNA-221/222 can target and suppress the expression of PTEN and p27kip1, thus alleviating repression of MAPK and HER2, respectively, ultimately leading to high cell proliferation. miRNA-221/222 also directly targets ER, pushing cancer cells toward EMT and endocrine resistance. On the other hand, miRNAs-124 and -145 attenuate EMT and resistance to hormonal therapy by targeting EMT-related transcription factors (SLUG and SNAII) thus, preventing their inhibition of E-cadherin. miRNA-124 also targets and degrades ETS, which leads to lower cell proliferation. miRNA-145 represses migration capacities of cancer cells by targeting JAM-1 and fascin. miRNA-9 plays a crucial role in the induction of EMT through direct repression of E-cadherin and indirect up-regulation of vimentin.

Fig. 4.

miRNA manipulation as a treatment modality. miRNA binds to a specific target mRNA to facilitate the downregulation of target proteins. miRNA mimics are synthetic oligonucleotide duplexes that have the same sequence as the endogenous miRNA and function as replacements to the downregulated miRNAs (act as tumor suppressors). Antagomirs (also called anti-miRs) are oligonucleotides that have complementarity with the target miRNA, thereby binding and preventing them from interacting with the target mRNA, allowing normal translation. A miR mask is complementary to a sequence in the mRNA and binds to it without affecting the mRNA integrity or translation, yet prevents the endogenous miRNA from binding. A sponge miR mask differs from the miR mask in that it binds to any mRNA with a similar target sequence and is therefore miRNA seed specific and not gene specific.
