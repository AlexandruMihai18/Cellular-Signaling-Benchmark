ANGIOGENESIS  

Implications for Rheumatoid Arthritis  

ALISA E. KOCH  

Angiogenesis, or new blood vessel growth, is important in fibrovascular disorders, such as wound repair, tumor growth, psoriasis, and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). This review focuses on the new developments in the angiogenesis field and their relationship to RA.  

The role of endothelium in inflammation  

In the RA synovium, there are many leukocytes adjacent to blood vessels. The exuberant proliferation of new blood vessels is crucial to the development of the RA pannus. Without new blood vessel growth, leukocyte ingress could not occur. Until recently, the endothelium lining the blood vessels was thought to be a passive bystander in inflammatory processes such as RA. However, it is now recognized as playing an active and pivotal part in a variety of inflammatory and immunologic processes, including presentation of antigen to other immune cells, coagulation, cytokine production, angiogenesis, recruitment of leukocytes to an inflammatory focus, and cellular adhesion (1) (Figure 1).  

Angiogenesis and angiogenic mediators  

Angiogenesis is a dynamic process. Angiogenesis refers to the formation of new capillary blood vessels from the existing microvascular bed (1–4). Interestingly, the normal vasculature is quiescent in adult mammals, except in the highly ordered processes of the female reproductive cycle, such as ovulation (5). Physiologic angiogenesis is a tightly regulated, self-limited process. Endothelial cells are among the longest lived cells in the body outside the central nervous system. Remarkably, in a normal adult vessel, only 1 in 10,000 endothelial cells, or 0.01%, is in cell division at any given time, presumably reflecting a process of cell turnover to maintain tissue vitality. In contrast, 14% of normal intestinal epithelial cells are in cell division. While gut cells turn over in days, endothelial cells turn over in years. Yet, the vasculature is so adaptable that in response to an appropriate stimulus, quiescent vasculature can be activated to produce new capillaries. In contrast to physiologic angiogenesis, pathologic angiogenesis, such as one might see in the RA synovium, persists over a longer time. Pathologic angiogenesis is seen in a variety of disorders, such as diabetic retinopathy, solid tumor growth, psoriasis, scleroderma, and RA.  

Angiogenic mediators. Angiogenic mediators can be broadly divided into 2 groups: stimulators, or proangiogenic factors, and inhibitors, or angiostatic factors (Figure 2). The regulation of angiogenesis is likely to result from a delicate balance of angiogenesis inducers and angiostatic agents. These angiogenic mediators include cytokines and growth factors, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and platelet-derived en-

dothelial cell growth factor (PD-ECGF), both of which have been identified in the RA joint (6–10) (Table 1). Angiogenin, which is also found in the RA joint, as well as interleukin-2 (IL-2) can mediate angiogenesis, as can the colony-stimulating factors, which may activate synovial tissue macrophages to produce cytokines and perhaps angiogenic factors (11).

Other growth factors include epidermal growth factor (EGF), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF). Our group has shown a role for HGF in RA synovial fluid-induced migration of endothelial cells in culture, a component of the angiogenic response (12,13).

Among early identified mediators were the fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). In an elegant process, using the knowledge that mast cells, which secrete heparin,

are proangiogenic, Dr. Judah Folkman’s laboratory purified basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), the classic angiogenic factor, using heparin-affinity chromatography columns (14). In RA, acidic and basic FGFs have been immunolocalized in the synovial tissues of RA and osteoarthritis (OA) patients by several groups of investigators (15). We were, however, unable to detect this growth factor in synovial fluids obtained from RA patients. While it is possible that this growth factor contributes to the proliferation and aggressive synovial phenotype found in the RA pannus, and though FGF receptor 1 is expressed on a variety of RA synovial tissue cells, including endothelial cells, the notion that this prototypic growth factor mediates angiogenesis per se in the RA joints has not thus far been tested (16–20).

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) has

presumably due to the elevated intraarticular pressure in RA joints, which may at times exceed the pressure within synovial capillaries (21,30). This is thought to result in movement-induced synovial capillary occlusion and a period of relative hypoxia followed by reactive hyperemia. Several hypoxia-responsive transcription-activating elements are located in the 5′ flanking region of the VEGF gene. Perfusion insufficiency results in hypoxia, which often induces a compensatory neovascularization to satisfy the needs of the tissue and induction of VEGF production. Hence, VEGF is likely an important mediator of angiogenesis in the RA joint.

Transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) is another interesting angiogenic cytokine. TGFβ has been shown by Drs. Ron Wilder, Roy Fava, and Ravinder Maini’s groups, among others, to be present in the human RA synovial fluid and synovial tissue. In RA, of the TGFβ subtypes, TGFβ1 appears to have the most prominent role (17,31,32). TGFβ is an angiogenic mediator. However, it does not appear to act directly on the endothelial cell. Instead, it mediates angiogenesis by recruiting bystander macrophages, which in turn, secrete angiogenic factors, with subsequent influence on endothelial cells (31,33–37). It is therefore noteworthy that TGFβ receptors, like endoglin, are up-regulated on myeloid elements of RA compared with osteoarthritic synovium (38). Likewise, TGFβ receptor II is found in the lining layer of RA synovial tissue that is characterized by active cellular proliferation (39). In the chorioallantoic membrane in vivo bioassay for angiogenesis, at low concentrations, TGFβ causes an inflammatory reaction, which leads indirectly to an angiogenic response. At higher concentrations, TGFβ inhibits the angiogenic response to other growth factors; hence, TGFβ may be a bifunctional regulator of angiogenesis (40).

What is the mechanism of action of angiogenic mediators like VEGF, bFGF and TGFs? Evidence accumulated mainly in the laboratory of Dr. David Cheresh over the last 5 years has indicated that the invasion, migration, and proliferation of endothelial cells is regulated, at least in part, by the integrin family of cell adhesion molecules (41–45). The integrin family is composed of 15 α and 8 β subunits that are expressed in more than 20 different combinations on a variety of cells. Particularly important in mediating angiogenesis are the αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins.

The αvβ3 integrin is expressed minimally, if at all, on resting or normal blood vessels. In contrast, the RA synovium is rich in αvβ3. When we examined αvβ3 expression in synovial tissues from patients with RA compared with OA or normal synovia, the expression of

Figure 3. A proposed mechanism of action of some angiogenic cytokines. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF-$\alpha$) act via $\alpha v \beta 3$ integrin. In contrast, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and transforming growth factor $\alpha$ (TGF-$\alpha$) appear to act via increasing protein kinase C (PKC) and subsequent action upon $\alpha v \beta 5$ integrin.

$\beta 3$ integrin was markedly up-regulated in RA compared with OA or normal blood vessel endothelium or blood vessel smooth muscle cells (46). Hence, the up-regulation of this integrin on abnormal vasculature implied that it might be important in a vascular process such as angiogenesis.

A newly emerging paradigm was proposed by Dr. David Cheresh (42) (Figure 3). When those investigators applied bFGF along with anti-$\alpha v \beta 3$ integrin, the angiogenic response in the corneal angiogenesis model was inhibited. The same effect occurred when anti-$\alpha v \beta 3$ integrin was incubated with the angiogenic cytokine tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$ (TNF$\alpha$). Recently, this group also showed that angiogenesis could be inhibited by using $\alpha v \beta 3$ antagonists. These antagonists promote unscheduled programmed cell death (apoptosis) of endothelial cells.

In contrast to the situation involving $\alpha v \beta 3$, when Cheresh and coworkers incubated the angiogenic mediators VEGF or TGF$\alpha$ with anti-$\alpha v \beta 5$ integrin, angiogenesis was inhibited, indicating that these 2 cytokines were acting to mediate angiogenesis through $\alpha v \beta 5$ integrin (42). Moreover, when they incubated VEGF or TGF$\alpha$ with inhibitors of protein kinase C (PKC), angiogenesis was blocked, indicating that VEGF and TGF$\alpha$ act via a PKC-dependent mechanism. This may not be a main mode of action of VEGF in RA, since $\alpha v \beta 5$ integrin has been reported as being expressed in normal and OA synovial tissue, but not in RA synovial tissue (47). Nonetheless, the mechanisms by which some of these cytokines act to promote angiogenesis are rapidly becoming identified.

Using the techniques of molecular biology, some very exciting findings have been generated over the last year. The cloning of TIE1 and TIE2 receptors linked to tyrosine kinases on endothelial cells added another chapter to the vasculogenesis story. The phenotype of mice deficient for these receptors indicated that the receptors play a role in vasculogenesis subsequent to the action of VEGF. However, the absence of information about the ligand for either of these receptors hindered the understanding of the contribution to vascular development. Recently, knowing the structure of TIE2, Dr. George Yancopoulos and coworkers cloned angiopoietin 1, the ligand for the TIE2 receptor, which is expressed on endothelial cells (48). Unlike VEGF, angiopoietin 1 is not a mitogen for endothelium, nor does it induce endothelial tube formation in vitro. Instead, its pattern of expression in the vicinity of forming vessels suggests that it plays a role in regulating the assembly of nonendothelial vessel wall components like vascular smooth muscle (3,48). This finding is strengthened by the observation reported by Dr. Suri and coworkers, who showed that mice deficient in angiopoietin 1 exhibit abnormal vasculature, in which the principal defect is failure to recruit vascular smooth muscle cells (49). For instance, in the heart, this defect is manifested as poorly developed endocardium.

One of the most exciting findings described by Dr. Miikka Vikkula and coworkers was the discovery that venous malformations in 2 human families could be mapped to the TIE2 receptor on endothelial cells, where a missense mutation results in an arginine-to-tryptophan substitution (50). Patients carrying this mutation de-

velop vein-like structures that are deficient in the non-
endothelial cells of the vessel wall; mainly, they lack
vascular smooth muscle cells, which results in thin-
walled vessels. Thus, an apparent defect in vascular
remodeling can occur from an activating mutation of a
receptor, from the absence of the ligand, or from a
deficiency of the TIE2 receptor itself (3). Therefore, the
TIE2/angiopoietin system appears to govern maturation
and stabilization of blood vessels. Interestingly, just a
few months ago, a naturally occurring inhibitor of an-
giopoietin 1, termed angiopoietin 2, was also described
by Yancopoulos and coworkers (51). Angiopoietin 2 is
an antagonist for the TIE2 receptor tyrosine kinase.
Natural antagonists for vertebrate tyrosine kinases are
atypical; thus, the discovery of a negative regulator
acting on the TIE2 system emphasizes the need for the
exquisite regulation of this angiogenic system. Addition-
ally, these very important findings begin to reveal the
molecular basis for vascular remodeling. The role of
this cytokine receptor system has not as yet been ex-
plored in RA.

It is possible for cytokines to act by recruiting
macrophages to an inflammatory focus. These macro-
phages, in turn, can mediate angiogenesis. One might
wonder, what are the important macrophage-derived
angiogenic mediators in the inflamed joint (52–54)?
Several years ago we described the cytokine IL-8 as an
important macrophage-derived mediator of angiogene-
sis (55). IL-8 is the prototype of the C-X-C family of
chemokines. This family displays 4 highly conserved
cysteine amino acid residues, with the first 2 cysteines
separated by 1 nonconserved amino acid, hence, the
C-X-C designation. These chemokines are 20–50% ho-
mologous on the amino acid level. IL-8 had been
demonstrated to be a potent chemotactic factor for a
variety of cells.

Our group of investigators postulated a novel
role for IL-8 as a potent macrophage-derived mediator
of angiogenesis, for several reasons (55,56). Our labora-
tory, as well as others, found that IL-8 was present in
large quantities in the RA joint. One of the properties of
IL-8 is that it binds heparin, which was a key feature of
the purification of the first angiogenic factor, bFGF.
This suggested to us that perhaps IL-8 was one of the
unidentified macrophage-derived angiogenic factors
that might be important in the RA joint.

IL-8 is a member of the C-X-C chemokine super-
gene family. What are the attributes of IL-8 that confer
its angiogenic activity? Drs. Carolyn Hebert and Ian
Clark-Lewis had shown that a salient amino acid se-
quence immediately preceding the first cysteine amino
acid in the primary structure of the C-X-C supergene
chemokine family members appeared to mediate neu-
trophil recruitment (57,58). In an elegant series of
studies, Drs. Bob Strieter and Peter Polverini reasoned
that IL-8–like chemokines were angiogenic if they con-
tained the 3–amino acid sequence Glu-Leu-Arg, also
known as the “ELR” motif. Indeed, when assayed in the
rat corneal bioassay for angiogenesis, only chemokines
containing the ELR motif were angiogenic (59,60).
Muteins of IL-8 engineered to lack the ELR motif were
nonangiogenic, indicating that this region was indeed
critical for chemokine-mediated angiogenesis. Thus, as
few as 3 amino acids dictate the angiogenic nature of
chemokines.

Other angiogenic factors important in the RA
joint include soluble adhesion molecules. Adhesion mol-
ecules can be shed from the cell surface and secreted.
The function of these soluble adhesion molecules is
unclear. The prevailing paradigm has been that these
molecules might serve an antiinflammatory role by
binding leukocytes, thus preventing them from adhering
to endothelium and entering inflamed tissues. Recently,
we proposed the converse paradigm, that these mole-
cules may be proinflammatory in some cases (61,62). We
showed that the soluble adhesion molecules, soluble
E-selectin (sE-selectin) and soluble vascular cell adhe-
sion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1), were potent mediators of
angiogenesis: sE-selectin appeared to function via an
endothelial sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup>–dependent mechanism, while
sVCAM-1 acted via an endothelial very late activation
antigen 4 (VLA-4)–dependent mechanism (Figure 4).
When human RA synovial fluids were immunodepleted
of these soluble adhesion molecules, angiogenesis was
markedly attenuated, indicating that they might play an
important role in angiogenesis in the RA joint.

The balance of angiogenesis inducers and inhibitors

Normally, angiogenesis inhibitors outweigh an-
giogenesis inducers. However, in diseases such as in-
flammatory RA, in tumor growth, or in wound repair,
angiogenesis inducers predominate. This scenario can
result from an overabundance of angiogenesis inducers
as well as from a paucity of angiogenesis inhibitors.

Angiogenesis inhibitors

It is likely that the field of angiogenesis inhibitors
will have protein application for the treatment of fibro-
proliferative diseases like neoplasia and RA. Currently,
a number of angiostatic agents have been identified,

Figure 4. Hypothesized mechanism of action of soluble endothelial cell adhesion molecules as angiogenic mediators. Soluble E-selectin (sE-selectin) acts via the endothelial ligand sialyl-Le<sup>x</sup> and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (sVCAM-1) acts via the endothelial ligand very late activation antigen 4 (VLA-4).

some of which fit into emerging paradigms. As discussed above, C-X-C chemokines, like IL-8, which contain an ELR motif, are angiogenic. Interestingly, the converse situation, in which the C-X-C chemokine does not contain an ELR motif, results in an angiostatic chemokine (Table 2). For instance, platelet factor 4 (PF-4) is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis. Two other chemokines, interferon-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and monokine induced by interferon-γ (MIG), are also potent angiostatic chemokines. Hence, the ELR motif appears to be critical for chemokine mediation of angiogenesis.

There are a number of angiostatic cytokines that have been identified. Some of these include interferons (IFNs) α, β, and γ and IL-12 (Figure 5). Other inhibitors include placental ribonuclease inhibitor, prolamine, retinoic acid, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase (63).

The first clues to the existence of endogenous

angiostatic inhibitors came with the observations that IFNα and PF-4 could inhibit endothelial cell chemotaxis and proliferation, respectively. It is interesting that the cytokines IFNs α, β, and γ inhibit angiogenesis. They may do so by a direct effect on the vasculature as well as by inducing the expression of IP-10 and MIG, chemokine inhibitors of angiogenesis, in other cell types. While IFNs have not proven to be effective in combating tumor growth, a very interesting application of IFNα2a as a therapy for life-threatening hemangiomas of infancy was pioneered by Dr. Judah Folkman’s group (64). Most hemangiomas are small, harmless marks that appear soon after birth, proliferate for 8–18 months, and then regress over the next 5–8 years. In some cases, however, hemangiomas can endanger vital organs, with a mortality rate of up to 60%. About a third of these hemangiomas respond to corticosteroids (64). Eighteen of 20 patients who had failed corticosteroid therapy had hemangiomas which regressed by 50% or more an average of 8 months after daily subcutaneous therapy with IFNα. Normally, these tumors would not be expected to regress in the first year of life. The main side effects included fever, neutropenia, and skin necrosis. Hence, this member of the IFN family is a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis that can be applied clinically to life-threatening hemangiomas. Whether this cytokine could inhibit RA synovial angiogenesis has not yet been determined.

IL-12, formerly called natural killer cell stimulatory factor or cytotoxic lymphocyte maturation factor, has potent antitumor and antimetastatic activities. It is

ANGIOGENESIS IN ARTHRITIS

![Diagram](#)

Figure 5. Inhibitors of angiogenesis produced by normal mammalian cells can act via cytokine cascade regulation. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) results in an increase in interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which results in angiogenesis inhibition. Additionally, IFN-γ directly may decrease metalloproteinase production, resulting in angiogenesis inhibition. IP-10 = interferon-inducible protein 10; PF4 = platelet factor 4.

produced by a number of cell types, including macrophages and B cells. A new paradigm of cytokine-controlled regulation of angiogenesis is appearing here as well (Figure 5). IL-12 can completely inhibit corneal neovascularization induced by bFGF (65,66). If one adds anti-IFNγ to this system, the angiostatic effect of IL-12 is inhibited, indicating that IL-12 acts via an IFNγ-mediated mechanism to suppress angiogenesis. Similarly, if one inhibits IP-10 production via immunodepletion of IP-10 in this system, the angiostatic effect of IL-12 is again reversed, indicating that IL-12 acts by inducing IFNγ production, which in turn, up-regulates chemokines like IP-10, which lack the ELR motif, with a net result of inhibiting angiogenesis. IP-10 and PF-4 share a common receptor and may therefore act in tandem to inhibit angiogenesis. Although not examined in these studies, IFNγ may also down-regulate metalloproteinase production, augmenting angiogenesis inhibition. IL-12 has been detected in isolated RA synovial fluid and synovial fluid mononuclear cells (67,68). It is unclear at this point whether administration of IL-12 in animal arthritis models or, eventually, in patients with RA would have a beneficial effect, since the effects of IL-12 on endothelial cell angiogenesis inhibition may be offset by its effects on other cells of the immune system.

Yet another paradigm of angiogenesis inhibition is emerging: angiostatic activity often resides in portions of larger common proteins that may or may not themselves be angiostatic (5) (Table 2). Examples of this paradigm include thrombospondin, fibronectin, prolactin, angiostatin, fragments of type II collagen, PF-4, and fragments of EGF. The finding that endothelium is quiescent for long periods of time and yet can be induced to sprout new capillaries in a matter of hours in response to an angiogenic stimulus, suggested that angiogenesis regulators might be stored for expedient use. The first indication of this paradigm was described by Dr. Noel Bouck and coworkers, who found that a nontumorigenic hamster cell line became tumorigenic with a mutation that inactivated a tumor suppressor gene (69,70). Comparison of the cell lines containing or missing the suppressor gene revealed that the nontumorigenic line released high levels of an angiogenesis inhibitor. The inhibitory activity was found to be a fragment of the adhesive glycoprotein thrombospondin 1, whose expression was linked to the presence of a tumor suppressor gene. Our group and others have shown that thrombospondin is expressed in the joints of RA patients (5,71). It is unclear whether quantities of angiogenesis inhibitors like thrombospondin are much lower than those of proangiogenic mediators in the joint. Since that time, a number of angiostatic molecules have been identified which are cryptic parts of other molecules germane to the connective tissue diseases. For instance, a 29-kd fragment of fibronectin, but not fibronectin itself, inhibits angiogenesis (72). Similarly, a 16-kd fragment of prolactin has been shown to inhibit endothelial cell proliferation (5).

A new inhibitor of angiogenesis, angiostatin, has been identified in some very elegant studies by Dr. Judah Folkman’s group (73,74) (Figure 6). This molecule was discovered based on the clinical observation that often after a primary tumor, such as a lung tumor, is identified and removed, micrometastases become

Figure 6. A proposed model for the angiostatic action of angiostatin (73). The primary (1°) tumor releases angiogenic factors in excess of angiostatic factors. In contrast, the primary tumor releases angiostatin, a plasminogen fragment, which inhibits the growth of distal metastases due to its long half-life (T₁/₂) in the circulation. At sites of distal metastasis, angiostatic factors outweigh angiogenic factors. Hence, a primary tumor can “control” distal metastasis.

manifest. In other words, it appeared that a primary tumor in some way controlled its metastasis. Using this information, Folkman and coworkers purified an inhibitor from liters of urine obtained from mice that had lung tumors. The hypothesis he generated was that a primary tumor initiates its own neovascularization by generating angiogenic stimuli in excess of angiogenic inhibitors. However, the angiogenesis inhibitor, by virtue of its longer half-life in the circulation, reaches the site of metastasis in excess of the angiogenesis stimulator escaping from the primary tumor or being secreted by the metastatic lesions themselves. As a result, metastasis can be controlled by the primary tumor. Moreover, when this group instilled angiostatin into immunodeficient mice bearing human tumors such as breast, colon, and prostate, the tumor growth was inhibited by more than 97%, as determined by tumor size. Angiostatin has been shown to be a fragment of the clotting factor plasminogen. Plasminogen itself is not angiostatic.

Endostatin, an angiogenesis inhibitor produced by mouse hemangioendothelioma cells, is a fragment of type XVIII collagen. Thus, since abundant components of the circulatory system, such as fibronectin and plasminogen, can be converted to potent angiostatic factors, it is likely that there exists a new form of regulation by proteases, such as serine proteases, to specifically release these molecules from their parent molecules (75). One might envision that in the case of RA, these inhibitors might be present, but down-regulated. It is likely that inhibitors of angiogenesis are present in the RA synovium, but are outweighed, in effect, by angiogenesis inducers.

Can angiogenesis regulation help us in the treatment of patients with RA?

Some of the endogenous and exogenous mediators of angiogenesis that have been identified to date include a cartilage-derived factor, angiostatic corticosteroids, minocycline, fumagillin, chloroquine, sulfapyridine, methotrexate, penicillamine, and thiol-containing compounds, such as gold-containing compounds (Table 3).

Interestingly, cartilage is avascular as well as relatively tumor resistant. So, it is reasonable that among the earliest-described inhibitors of neovascularization were cartilage-derived inhibitors described by Drs. Marcia Moses, Judah Folkman, and Klaus Kuettner, among others (76–83). Inhibitors of angiogenesis have been purified from various types of cartilage. Shark cartilage contains a potent inhibitor of angiogenesis, accounting for its popularity as an unorthodox therapy for cancer. Dr. Marcia Moses has identified a cartilage-derived inhibitor from bovine scapula, which is also an inhibitor of collagenase. Regardless of the source, it is intriguing

that cartilage, which lies in juxtaposition to the inflamed RA synovium, may hold a key to understanding how one might go about inhibiting the angiogenic process in the joint.

Angiostatic steroids were described by Dr. Folkman's group as a new class of steroids that inhibit angiogenesis in the presence of heparin (84–86). Tetrahydrocortisol was the most potent of these. These steroids lack glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid activity and exert their angiostatic effect partly by increasing the dissolution of basement membrane components. Though these angiostatic steroids function best in the presence of heparin, the anticoagulant function of heparin is also not necessary for the inhibition of angiogenesis.

Minocycline is a semisynthetic tetracycline antimicrobial agent with anticollagenase properties that is also potently antiangiogenic (87). Minocycline has been used in several clinical trials in RA patients and was shown to be somewhat effective for patients with mild-to-moderate RA (86,88–90). The mechanism of action of minocycline in RA remains unknown, and it might be that it acts, at least in part, by inhibiting angiogenesis in the joint. Since many trials of antirheumatic therapies are short (≤6 months), this may not be a sufficient length of time to detect inhibition of angiogenesis clinically. Fumagillin is an angiostatic compound discovered by Dr. Judah Folkman and coworkers. Like the story of the famous discovery of penicillin, Dr. Folkman's laboratory was culturing endothelial cells when they noticed an area of the plate that appeared to be contaminated with fungus. While most people would have simply discarded the culture, Dr. Folkman examined it and noted that the endothelial cells were not growing in a zone that surrounded the fungus. He then went on to purify the material liberated by the fungus, which was termed “fumagillin” (91–93). A derivative of this material, AGM-1470, was found by Dr. Ernest Brahn and coworkers to be effective in inhibiting both angiogenesis and collagen-induced as well as adjuvant-induced arthritis in rats (94,95). This compound may be a potential antiangiogenic agent that may be used for treatment of rheumatic disease in the future.

Chloroquine has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis in vitro (96). Its mechanism of action is not clear. Sulfasalazine is commonly used in the treatment of a variety of diseases including RA. The active metabolite of sulfasalazine may be sulfapyridine. One study showed that while sulfapyridine inhibited endothelial proliferation, sulfasalazine and 5 aminosalicylic acid metabolites did not (97). Methotrexate, a current favorite for treatment of RA, was shown by Dr. Soichirou Hirata and coworkers to inhibit endothelial proliferation in vitro (98). D-penicillamine was shown by Drs. Matsubara and Ziff to inhibit endothelial proliferation (99).

We, as well as Dr. Ziff’s group, examined the ability of gold-containing compounds to inhibit angiogenesis (98,100–103). Our 2 studies had differing conclusions. While Dr. Ziff’s group noted a direct angiostatic effect of gold-containing compounds, we found that gold-containing compounds did not directly affect endothelial cells in vitro or in vivo. Surprisingly, they acted indirectly, by affecting the ability of macrophages to secrete angiogenic factors (Figure 7). Moreover, in addition to studying gold sodium thiomalate and auranoﬁn, we examined the thiol portion of gold sodium thiomalate. To our surprise, the thiol moiety itself inhibited macrophage production of angiogenic activity. We studied this effect further and found that thiol-

containing compounds, such as reduced glutathione, were all potent inhibitors of macrophage-derived angiogenic activity production. We later found that this effect may be due to inhibition of macrophage activation and the production of oxygen free radicals (101, 102, 104). Thus, many antirheumatic drugs, such as gold compounds or D-penicillamine, that contain thiol groups may suppress RA, due at least in part, to their ability to inhibit macrophage production of angiogenic and other mediators.

In conclusion, there are many exciting developments that have occurred recently in the field of angiogenesis. Studying angiogenesis may result in a better understanding of RA pathogenesis and will likely have an impact on the care we give to patients.
