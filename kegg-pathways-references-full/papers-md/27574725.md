Abstract

Cellular senescence was first described in 1961 in a seminal study by Hayflick and Moorhead as a limit to the replicative lifespan of somatic cells after serial cultivation. Since then, major advances in our understanding of senescence have been achieved suggesting that this mechanism is activated also by oncogenic stimuli, oxidative stress and DNA damage, giving rise to the concept of premature senescence. Regardless of the initial trigger, numerous experimental observations have been provided to support the notion that both replicative and premature senescence play pivotal roles in early stages of tumorigenesis and in response of tumor cells to anticancer treatments. Moreover, various studies have suggested that the induction of senescence by both chemo- and radiotherapy in a variety of cancer types correlates with treatment outcome. As it is widely accepted that cellular senescence may function as a fundamental barrier of tumor progression, the significance of senescence for clinical interventions that make use of novel molecular targeting-based modalities needs to be well defined. Interestingly, despite numerous studies evaluating efficacies of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) targeting strategies in both preclinical and clinical settings, the relevance of RTKs inhibition-associated senescence in tumors remains less characterized. Here we review the available literature that describes premature senescence as a major mechanism following targeting of RTKs in preclinical as well as in clinical settings. Additionally, we discuss the possible role of diverse RTKs in regulating the induction of senescence following cellular stress and possible implications of this crosstalk in identification of biomarkers of inhibitor-mediated chemo- and radiosensitization approaches.

# 1. Introduction

Cellular senescence, defined as a state of irreversible cell cycle arrest, was first described in a seminal study by Hayflick and Moorhead in 1961 as a limit to the replicative lifespan of somatic cells after serial cultivation *in vitro* [1]. Today, we know that this phenomenon reflects one type of senescence known as replicative senescence, which is caused by shortened and/or damaged chromosome telomeres generated through repeated rounds of DNA replication coupled to cell division [2]. In the last decades, major advances in our understanding of senescence have been achieved. This mechanism was also shown to occur prematurely in response to various types of stress, such as overexpression of oncogenes, chromatin perturbation, external DNA damage and oxidative stress, with the final goal of removing damaged cells from a proliferative state [3]. Regardless of the initial trigger, both replicative and premature-induced senescent cells share several characteristic features that are being used for their characterization and identification both *in vitro* and *in vivo* [4]. Growth arrest (usually at a stage with a DNA content typical for G1 but under certain circumstances or in the case of cancer cells also for G2- or S-phases of the cell cycle (reviewed in [5])) that cannot be reversed by growth factors stimulation is one of the key features of senescent cells. The inability of senescent cells to progress through the cell cycle is further accompanied by the acquisition of typical changes in cell morphology such as increase in volume, flat shape, vacuole-rich cytoplasm and increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-βGal) activity [4, 6, 7]. Cellular senescence is also characterized by the presence of alterations in the chromatin structure: most senescent cells present characteristic regions with condensed heterochromatin known as

senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF). SAHF are particularly enriched in histone 3 trimethylated on lysine 9 (H3K9me3), which act by repressing several E2F-regulated genes involved in cell cycle progression and are induced by mechanisms involving both p53 and p16 activation (Figure 1) [8, 9]. Notably, even though senescent cells are in a state of an irreversible cell cycle arrest, they can remain metabolically active for long periods of time and secret a wide range of cytokines, chemokines and proteases to communicate their compromised state to the surrounding tissue regardless of the cell cycle phase in which they are arrested [10, 11]. This complex network of secreted factors is known as senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) and it has been shown to have autocrine and paracrine effects on senescent cells and tissue microenvironment, respectively [12]. Lastly, both replicative and premature cellular senescence are characterized by a robust activation of the DNA damage response (DDR) required for initiation and maintenance of the senescence phenotype (Figure 2) [13]. In presence of DNA damage, Ser139-phosphorylated histone variant H2AX (γH2AX) accumulates at the site of the lesion and serves as a platform for the recruitment of DNA repair proteins, resulting in the formation of so-called DDR nuclear foci. Accordingly, senescent cells are usually characterized by the presence of DDR foci, also referred to as senescence-associated DNA damage foci (SDFs) [13, 14].

2. Molecular mechanisms in premature senescence

Over the past several years, the mechanisms responsible for the induction and the maintenance of premature senescence have attracted considerable interest as experimental evidence supports the notion that this type of senescence plays an

important role in early stages of tumorigenesis as well as in the response of tumor cells
to anticancer therapies. In the following subsections, we will review main molecular
mechanisms that were shown to induce premature senescence and discuss their
contribution to tumor cells response to both chemo- and radiotherapy.

2.1. Oncogene-induced senescence

Oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is a robust and sustained antiproliferative
response brought about by oncogenic signaling resulting from overexpression or
mutation of an oncogene or the inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. The pathways
mediating OIS are complex and incompletely elucidated but the proliferative arrest
involves activation of both the RB and p53 pathways (Figure 1) [15, 16]. Importantly,
OIS is one of the best-known examples where premature senescence serves as a
barrier to tumorigenesis. Indeed, expression of high levels of an oncogene in normal
cells often results in the induction of senescence rather than in cell transformation [17].
Ruth Sager and colleagues were among the first to show that normal human fibroblasts
are resistant to tumorigenesis induced by viral infection through senescence induction
[18]. Years later, it was reported that overexpression of an oncogenic version of HRAS
(HRASG12V) failed to transform normal cells grown in vitro but induced instead a
transient increase in cell proliferation followed by a stable cell cycle arrest [19]. Soon
after this observation, overexpression or expression of oncogenic versions of other
members of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/ERK pathway located
downstream of RTKs such as RAF, MEK and BRAF, was analogously shown to induce
senescence in vitro, highlighting a role for cellular senescence in the defense against
neoplastic transformation when this signaling cascade is inappropriately active [20-22].

Even though the molecular mechanisms of oncogene-induced senescence were mostly investigated in vitro, they were also validated in vivo scenarios using mouse models with inducible endogenous oncogenes. Collado and colleagues showed that premalignant lung adenomas induced by oncogenic KRAS (KRASG12V) are, unlike malignant adenocarcinomas, positive for markers of senescence, confirming the hypothesis of senescence induction during the early stages of tumorigenesis driven by an oncogene [23]. Similar observations were made in a subsequent study by Morton et al. in a model of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma driven by an endogenous oncogenic KRAS, where mutation of one of the most important mediators of the senescence program, the TP53 gene, led to an escape from KRAS-induced growth arrest [24]. In addition to the proximal downstream kinases of RAS, also distal effectors of the MAPK/ERK pathway such as the E2F family of transcription factors were shown to induce senescence. For instance, upon deregulation of the E2F3 activity, sustained abnormal proliferation and tumor formation was prevented by engagement of the senescence response in vivo [25]. Concerning the molecular mechanisms responsible for induction of senescence following oncogene activation, it has been suggested that multiple processes cooperate to promote and maintain this type of senescence response, including replicative stress and accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) that characterize the initial response of normal cells to oncogene activation. Elevated ROS levels subsequently lead to the accumulation of DNA damage, activation of the DDR and consequent induction of senescence [15].

2.2. DNA damage-induced senescence

9
Accumulating evidence supports the fact that the direct damaging of DNA anywhere in the genome, either by endogenous or exogenous insults, can stimulate cells to undergo senescence [26]. In this respect, many DNA-damaging agents (DDAs) including classical chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiation (IR) were also shown to induce senescence as an alternative to or possibly overlapping with other post-insult outcomes such as apoptosis, autophagy or mitotic catastrophe, that would occur following excessive DNA damage introduction or unsuccessful repair of stalled replication forks [27]. Similarly to senescence induction in response to oncogene activation, accumulation of DNA damage is also sensed by the DDR machinery, leading to the downstream activation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p16, which prevent inappropriate cell cycle progression due to unrepaired damage [13]. An early study using in vitro cultured normal human fibroblasts showed a prolonged and irreversible cell cycle arrest resembling senescence following induction of DNA damage by IR [28]. Later studies reported senescence-like growth arrest in response to IR in both normal human fibroblasts and cancer cells as a mechanism to eliminate cells harboring irreparable DNA damage for the maintenance of genome integrity [29-32]. Similarly to IR, many others DDAs have also been reported to induce senescence by causing severe DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo. The study by te Poele and colleagues was one of the first to show that senescence may be a normal cellular response to DNA damage in tumor cells by reporting induction of senescence in tumor cell cultures and tumor tissue upon the topoisomerase inhibitor SN-38 treatment [33]. Similarly, retinoids and camptothecin were found to cause permanent growth inhibition
in a panel of breast carcinoma cells and in human colon cancer cells, respectively [34, 35]. Consistent with these findings, mice deficient in DNA repair caused by inactivation of the XRCC4, LIG4 or BRCA1 genes exhibited premature senescence both in vivo and in vitro cultured mouse embryonic fibroblasts originating from the same animal [36-38]. Collectively, these data propose DNA damage-induced senescence as a critical component of cellular responses to various types of stress, including the one imposed by chemotherapeutic drugs and IR.

2.3. Additional inducers of premature senescence

In addition to a senescence phenotype instigated by oncogene activation or endo-and exogenous DNA damage, several reports from the last two decades identified other mechanisms that stimulate cells to undergo premature irreversible cell cycle arrest. Similarly to oncogene activation, an event of a loss of a tumor suppressor was also reported to induce premature senescence in various models. As shown by Chen and colleagues in 2005, inactivation of PTEN, a phosphatase that negatively regulates phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-dependent signaling, results in a senescence-like growth arrest in a mouse model of prostate cancer [39]. Few years later, Young and colleagues reported that deletion of the tumor suppressor gene von Hippel-Lindau (VHL), frequently mutated in renal cell carcinomas, leads to induction of senescence in vivo [40]. Premature senescence can also be triggered by cytokines that possess potent antiproliferative activity such as β-interferon. Sustained signaling of β-interferon was shown to promote premature senescence both in normal cells as well as in cells harboring premalignant changes, where its signaling was associated with high ROS

11
levels and activation of a ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM)/checkpoint kinase 2 (CHK2)-mediated DNA damage pathway [41]. Likewise, prolonged signaling by tumor growth factor β (TGFβ) was shown to induce senescence response in keratinocytes in vitro and to suppress malignant conversion in a mouse model of multistage skin carcinogenesis [42]. As aforementioned, oxidative stress and consequent accumulation of ROS is another important trigger of premature senescence. For instance, human fibroblasts were shown to undergo senescence when grown under higher oxygen tension (20%) and to extend their proliferative lifespan when cultured in lower oxygen concentrations (under 3%) [43]. Moreover, in a study by Blander and colleagues, increase in ROS levels by addition of hydrogen peroxide or via inhibition of the ROS scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase type 1 (SOD1), induced premature senescence in human fibroblasts [44]. Mechanistically, accumulation of intracellular ROS can damage various cellular components via oxidation of DNA, proteins and lipids [45, 46]. Furthermore, a recent systems biology study reported the existence of a positive feedback loop between ROS and the DDR in senescent cells: activation of the DDR triggered mitochondrial dysfunction leading to enhanced ROS activation, which in turn generated additional DNA damage [47]. Lastly, ROS have been reported to interfere, either directly or indirectly, with the two main pathways involved in both induction and maintenance of senescence, the p53 and the p16INK4A retinoblastoma (RB) signal transduction cascades [48, 49].

2.4. Premature senescence in cancer

As aforementioned, premature senescence has been shown to play a crucial role in tumorigenesis as well as in cancer progression and in tumor cells responses to particular anticancer therapies. The presence of senescent cells in pre-neoplastic lesions and their absence in malignant tumors suggest that senescence can act as a barrier to tumor development, most probably, by suppressing cell proliferation [50, 51]. However, cancer cells were shown to be able to bypass induction of cellular senescence in response to aberrant activation of oncogenes by deregulating important cell cycle checkpoint genes such as TP53, p16INK4a and Rb, leading to extended growth of the pre-malignant cells and eventually leading to cancer progression [52]. Indeed, mutations in the p53 and p16INK4A-RB signaling pathways are often found in tumors. In this respect, p53-deficient mice were shown to harbor cells that fail to undergo senescence in response to stress stimuli and to be cancer-prone [5, 39, 53]. Interestingly, despite the fact that cancer cells have partially lost their ability to become senescent, they seem to have retained some of the components of the senescence program of terminal cell cycle arrest such as signals that would activate p53 in tumors initiated by p53 loss [54, 55], and are able to undergo premature senescence in response to exogenous DDAs, including chemo- and radiotherapy [56]. The pioneer work of Schmitt and colleagues in 2002 provided direct evidence that cellular senescence can be induced following chemotherapy in vivo and thus can contribute to the treatment outcome. By using a model of primary murine lymphomas, the authors observed that mice bearing tumors capable of drug-induced senescence had a better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects [57]. Since then, several studies

have described senescence induced by the DNA damage in response to chemo- or
radiotherapy in a variety of cancer types, associated with treatment success (reviewed
in [50, 58]). However, the beneficial effect of senescence as a potential outcome in
response to anticancer treatments has generated also a long lasting debate as
senescent cells remain metabolically active for long periods of time and can secrete
SASP factors known to stimulate phenotypes associated with aggressiveness of cancer
cells [59, 60]. On the other hand, the acquisition of the SASP that enables senescent
cells to communicate with their environment by secreting various cytokines and growth
factors, was also shown to attract immune effectors such as natural killer (NK) and the
CD4+ T cells, and to promote clearance of both senescent and cancer cells, a
phenomenon commonly known as “senescence surveillance” [54, 61, 62]. In this
respect, the work from Xue and colleagues provides an elegant example of tumor
regression in vivo obtained through the induction of senescence and consequent
clearance of senescent cells by the immune system. By using a mouse model of liver
cancer development, they demonstrated that tumors initiated by the loss of p53 are
eliminated following reactivation of p53 through the induction of senescence and
concomitant activation of the innate immune system responsible for tumors clearance
[54]. Another interesting illustration of a possible interplay between senescence cells
and the immune system has been provided in a recent manuscript by Tasdemir and
colleagues, who report the role of the chromatin reader BRD4 in response of senescent
cells to immune surveillance [63].

Collectively, the available data suggest that cellular senescence is a critical component
of tumor cell response to various modes of stress and therefore could be a significant
factor determining treatment outcomes of routinely used chemo- and radiosensitizing  
treatment modalities but potentially also of those of targeted therapies. The promising  
notion that cellular senescence following anti-cancer therapeutic approaches might be a  
desirable treatment outcome is based on the assumption that senescence-linked growth  
arrest, in contrast to the reversible growth arrest typical for quiescent cells, has been  
denoted as essentially permanent: once arrested, senescent cells fail to initiate DNA  
replication despite adequate growth conditions [5, 64]. However, this concept is being  
challenged by studies reporting that tumor cells can potentially escape from their  
senescence state through various mechanisms such as the p53, p16(INK4A) and/or Rb  
inactivation, Cdc2/cdk1 overexpression, the development of polyploidy, the survival of  
cancer stem cells or restoration of the nuclear landscape [65-67]. In this case, therapy-  
induced senescence could, as opposed to treatment success, represent a means  
whereby tumor cells evade the potential toxicity of chemotherapy and radiation, allowing  
for the eventual tumor re-emergence by restoring their proliferative potential.

3. Senescence as a biologic endpoint following pharmacological targeting of  
RTKs in cancer  

Despite numerous experimental evidences supporting the notion that premature  
senescence plays an important role in the responses of tumor cells to both chemo- and  
radiotherapy, its relevance as a tumor cell outcome following molecular targeted  
therapies remains less characterized. Interestingly, a growing body of studies that aimed  
at evaluating the anticancer efficacies of RTKs targeting strategies have highlighted an  
important role of senescence as cellular response alternative to or possibly overlapping  with other treatment outcomes such as apoptosis (programmed cell death), necrosis (cell death by enzymatic degradation), autophagy (intracellular degradation) or mitotic catastrophe (destruction of a cell during mitosis). Here we review and discuss the therapeutic potential of cellular senescence following inhibition of various RTK systems of high therapeutic relevance, as a monotherapy or in combination with DNA-damaging agents.

### 3.1. Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) targeting and senescence

EGFR is probably the most extensively characterized RTK system whose inhibition was shown to exert its antitumor effect through induction of cellular senescence in various cancer models. The 2006 study from Hotta and collaborators provided the first indication that the EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor gefitinib (Iressa, ZD1839, AstraZeneca) can lead to pronounced cellular senescence instead of cell death in both in vitro and ex vivo models of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [68]. By using gefitinib-sensitive (PC-9 and EBC-2/R) and -resistant (RERF-LC-MS) NSCLC cells, they reported that clinically relevant concentrations of this EGFR inhibitor (0.1 and 1 μM) induced a marked growth inhibition in the two sensitive cell lines, yet without a significant induction of apoptosis. Notably, gefitinib-sensitive cells displayed clear features of cellular senescence following EGFR inhibition: arrest in the G1 phase of the cell-cycle, enlarged and flattened cell morphology and enhanced SA-βGal activity, which represents the most widely used senescence biomarker. Contrary, none of these features were induced by gefitinib in inhibitor-resistant RERF-LC-MS cells. The in vitro observations were further substantiated ex vivo by culturing tumor cells collected from a malignant pleural effusion

16in a 73-year-old man with locally advanced NSCLC. Treatment of these cells with gefitinib led to a significant increase of SA-βGal positive cells whereas an increase in apoptosis was not observed. A relevant aspect that has emerged from this study is that the number of senescent cells remarkably decreased while apoptotic cells became dominant by using higher concentration of gefitinib (10 μM). As supported by other studies where senescence was shown to contribute to the effect of various anticancer treatment modalities (reviewed in [50, 58]), the induction of senescence can be achieved by applying lower dosages of chemotherapeutic agents than those required to drive short-term proliferative arrest or cell death, thus offering an opportunity to reduce toxic side-effects inherent to many currently employed therapies [69]. In this respect, for example, Schmitt and colleagues reported that MYC-initiated lymphomas that responded to cyclophosphamide by inducing tumor cell senescence correlated with a better prognosis following chemotherapy than those harboring tumors with senescence defects [57] and, similarly, Han and colleagues showed that high doses of camptothecin produced massive apoptosis in HCT 116 colon cancer cells while low doses initiated senescence [34].

Few years after Hotta described gefitinib-induced senescence, the study by Wang and collaborators was the first to report the potential benefit of senescence induction for radiosensitization of NSCLC cells following EGFR inhibition in both in vitro as well as in vivo models [70]. Using either the small molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib or the monoclonal antibody cetuximab as EGFR targeting strategies, they showed that EGFR inhibition significantly decreased the clonogenic potential of irradiated A549 NSCLC cells and led to a pronounced induction of cellular senescence features including

17
accumulation of cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, increased levels of the CDK

inhibitor p21 as well as of the trimethylated histone H3K9, morphologic characteristics

indicating premature differentiation and SA-βGal expression. The in vitro observations

were also confirmed in xenograft models established by growing A549 cells in nude

mice, where irradiation led to an intense SA-βGal staining in the presence of erlotinib.

Study of 10 additional NSCLC cell lines revealed that senescence is a prominent

mechanism of radiosensitization and thus can potentially serve as a widespread

biological outcome following EGFR inhibition in irradiated cells. It is well accepted that

the senescence program is predominantly established and maintained by the p53 and

the p16-RB signal transduction cascades, which converge in the activation of the CDKs

inhibitors p21 and p16 with crucial functions in regulating the onset of cellular

senescence [5]. Importantly, the study of Wang et al. contributed to a better

understanding of the relative roles of these signal transduction cascades in the induction

of cellular senescence. Among the panel of NSCLC cell lines that were included, cells

harboring wild type p53 were shown to undergo senescence in a p53-dependent

manner as demonstrated by abrogation of erlotinib-mediated radiosensitization and

senescence upon expressing a p53-273L mutant in these cells. Contrary, in NSCLC

cells with a mutant p53, an induction of p16 expression consistent with the known role of

this protein in p53-independent senescence was observed upon erlotinib and radiation

treatment. Notably, these results, in line with data of other reports [71-73], indicate that

loss of p53 and/or p16 function, which often occurs in tumors, does not necessary

exclude the possibility of tumor cells to undergo senescence, thus providing a

senescence-associated radiosensitizing potential also in cells with compromised p53 or

p16 activity. Furthermore, in an attempt to elucidate a common mechanism of

radiosensitization in the panel of NSCLC cell lines included in the study, the authors observed that senescence and radiosensitization were both linked to an increase in residual radiation-induced DNA double-strand breaks regardless of the cellular p53/p16 status, indicating thus a common mechanism of radiosensitization by erlotinib or cetuximab across diverse genetic backgrounds. Interestingly, this mechanism was at least partially mediated by disruption of the MEK-ERK pathway, thus providing an evidence for a common role of MEK-ERK in modulating the levels of radiation-induced DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) in NSCLC cells.

In 2013, Dai and collaborators reported that simultaneous blocking of EGFR together with the insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xl protein triggered apoptosis and senescence in human nasopharyngeal carcinoma CNE2 cells [74]. By using vector-based RNAi technology, they could initially show that knockdown of EGFR, IGF1R and Bcl-xl mRNAs resulted in accumulation of CNE2 cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle. Further analysis demonstrated that this was accompanied by increased counts of apoptotic and senescent cells, accumulation of histone-bound DNA fragments and emergence of SA-βGal-positive CNE2 cells, thus providing an important example of a possible cooperation between a cell death mechanism and senescence to contribute to the completion of a particular anticancer therapeutic approach.

Further data supporting a link between EGFR targeting and senescence induction in cancer have been furnished by the work of Liu and collaborators, who recently reported the antitumor effect of the isoquinoline alkaloid berberine through induction of cellular senescence in glioblastoma cells both in vitro and in tumor xenografts [75]. Proliferation assays as well as flow cytometry analysis indicated that berberine potently inhibited the

proliferation of the U87, U251 and U118 glioblastoma cells and caused a G0-G1 cell
cycle arrest. Although previous studies showed that berberine primarily exerts its
anticancer effects by inducing cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis [76], when treated by
berberine, there was hardly any increase in the percentage of apoptotic glioblastoma
cells. Instead, berberine treatment led to a significant increase in the percentage of SA-
βGal positive cells, suggesting that induction of cellular senescence is the major
berberine-mediated antitumor mechanism occurring in this tumor entity. Mechanistically,
this onset of senescence was shown to be mediated by the berberine-dependent
downregulation of the EGFR and of the RAF-MEK-ERK pathway operating downstream
of the receptor [75]. Indeed, in berberine-treated cells, EGFR protein levels as well as
the activity of the RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway were greatly reduced and
pharmacologic inhibition or RNA interference of either EGFR or MEK similarly induced
cellular senescence in glioblastoma cells. Interestingly, berberine also potently inhibited
the growth of U87 tumor xenografts as confirmed by reduced tumor volume. This was
accompanied by downregulation of EGFR and induction of senescence, as confirmed by
a low presence of apoptotic but a widespread distribution of SA-βGal-positive cells. An
important aspect highlighted within this particular study is related to the reduced toxic
side effects inherent to many therapeutic modalities that are observed following
induction of senescence compared to other cellular biological outcomes such as cell
death. In this respect it has been shown that induction of senescence can be achieved
by applying lower dosages of DNA damaging agents or other anticancer treatments than
those required to drive short-term proliferative arrest or cell death [73]. Similarly, the
work by Liu et al. showed that berberine possesses a more potent antitumor effect on

glioblastoma cells than temozolomide, which represents the first-line of adjuvant treatment in combination with radiotherapy for this type of cancer and is known to cause serious side effects [77]. More specifically, berberine was reported to have an IC50 that is considerably lower than that of temozolomide in all the glioblastoma cells included in the study. In addition, senescence-dependent tumor growth inhibition by berberine in vivo was not accompanied by loss of body weight while temozolomide treatment, on the other hand, resulted in a great reduction in body mass and early death.

In a recently published study, the work by Zhu and collaborators elegantly demonstrated how induction of senescence can also cooperate with multiple cell death pathways (e.g. apoptosis and autophagy) in overcoming the resistance to EGFR inhibition [78]. By using gefitinib-sensitive (PC9) and gefitinib-resistant (PC9/G) NSCLC cells, they observed that co-treatment by gefitinib and the natural polyphenol compound resveratrol, reported to elicit DNA damage [79], partially restored gefitinib sensitivity in PC9/G cells. Mechanistically, the authors showed that the combined gefitinib/resveratrol treatment synergistically restored gefitinib sensitivity of PC9/G cells through concomitant induction of apoptosis, autophagy and senescence, as demonstrated by increased expression of cleaved caspase-3, LC3B-II and accumulation of SA-βGal positive cells, respectively. Interestingly, inhibition of apoptosis or autophagy by the specific caspase-3 inhibitor Ac-DEVD-CHO and the 3-methyladenine, respectively, revealed that autophagy antagonized apoptosis and triggered senescence during the combined treatment by gefitinib and resveratrol. These findings indicate that senescence rather than apoptosis may be the main cellular process responsible for overcoming gefitinib resistance in response to resveratrol treatment in NSCLC cells, being in line with other studies where

autophagy and senescence were shown to contribute to the outcome of radio- or chemotherapy in apoptosis-resistant cancer cells [80, 81]. One of the main highlights from this work is that apoptosis is not a sole determinant of the synergistic anticancer effects of receptor tyrosine kinase inhibition and DNA damaging agents. Indeed, multiple cell death pathways can be involved, and the complex interplay between them determines the final therapeutic effects of anticancer strategies involving receptor tyrosine kinase targeting.

3.2. Senescence induction upon targeting of the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)/VEGF receptor (VEGFR) system

Apart of EGFR targeting, inhibition of several other RTK systems was shown to successfully exert an antitumor effect via induction of cellular senescence in tumor cells. In this respect, two recent studies reported a novel antitumor activity of VEGFR targeting involving the induction of senescence in both mouse and human models of colorectal cancer [82, 83]. Based on the work of Watanabe and his collaborators from 1997, which provided the first indication of a role of the VEGF/VEGR axis in delaying the onset of cellular senescence in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells, Hasan and colleagues hypothesized that VEGF inhibition may directly influence cellular senescence in colorectal cancer cells where VEGFR is frequently upregulated [82, 84, 85]. Indeed, when using the anti-VEGF recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody bevacizumab as well as the VEGFR kinase inhibitor Ki8751 as two distinct targeting strategies of the VEGF/VEGFR signaling axis, no effect on cell viability was noted in a panel of VEGFR-positive colorectal cancer cells in comparison to untreated controls. However, inhibition
of either VEGF or VEGFR by bevacizumab and Ki8751, respectively, caused a significant increase in cellular senescence in the same settings as demonstrated by higher SA-βGal activity in vitro. For in vivo validation of these findings, tumor xenografts obtained by growing the VEGFR-positive colorectal cancer cell line MIP 101 in mice treated with 2.5 mg/kg of bevacizumab for 3 weeks, were stained for SA-βGal. Interestingly, while senescent cells were undetectable in tumors from saline and human IgG-treated control mice, positive SA-βGal staining was observed in 75% of tumors originating from bevacizumab-treated mice. As aforementioned, induction as well as maintenance of senescence is tightly regulated by the p53 and p16-RB signaling cascades, which act either separately or cooperate to achieve a stable proliferation arrest of cells that are irreversibly damaged. To understand the relative roles of these signal transduction cascades in VEGF or VEGFR inhibition-dependent induction of senescence, the authors examined the effect of bevacizumab on the expression of p53 and p16 in the panel of colorectal cancer cell lines included in their study. Upregulation of p16 protein levels following VEGF inhibition and abrogation of bevacizumab-induced cellular senescence after siRNA-mediated silencing of the p16 gene in MIP 101 cells suggested a p16-dependent mechanism of senescence induction. In line with this conclusion, silencing of p53 had no effect on senescence induction in colorectal cancer cells treated by bevacizumab. Notably, the in vitro and the in vivo observations reported in this work appear to be clinically relevant as colorectal cancer tissues obtained from patients treated with bevacizumab before surgical resection showed a higher proportion of senescent cells compared to tissues from untreated patients [82]. Moreover, in support of the p16-dependent mechanism of senescence induction observed in vitro, an

23
increase in p16 protein levels was also detected in positive senescent cells in colon
tumor tissues originating from bevacizumab-treated patients.

More recently, an interesting study from Foersch and collaborators provided additional
mechanistic insights into the role of VEGF/VEGFR targeting-associated senescence in
both human and mouse models of colorectal cancer [83]. Using conditional knockout
mice for VEGFR2 (VEGFR2ΔIEC), the authors were able to demonstrate that
VEGF/VEGFR2 signaling plays a crucial role in promoting tumor development and
progression of an experimental model of colitis-associated cancer by bypassing cellular
senescence in intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). This was shown by reporting significantly
lower cell proliferation, accumulation of cellular senescence markers such as γH2AX,
p16, p21, as well as SA-βGal positive cells in VEGFR2ΔIEC tumors when compared with
control VEGFR2fl/fl tumors. From a mechanistic perspective, both in vitro and in vivo data
demonstrated that inactivation of VEGFR2 signaling and subsequent induction of
senescence was mediated through downregulation of the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway
with subsequent activation and accumulation of p21, which was responsible for
induction as well as maintenance of the senescence phenotype. Remarkably, induction
of cellular senescence in tumor cells from VEGFR2ΔIEC mice was accompanied by
increased infiltration of tumor tissues with adaptive immune cells. As reported also by
others, an increased adaptive immune response to senescent tumor cells was shown to
promote clearance of both senescent and tumor cells, a phenomenon known as
“senescence surveillance” [54, 61]. In this respect, the work from Xue and colleagues
provided a compelling example of tumor regression in vivo that was accomplished
through the induction of senescence and consequent clearance of senescent cells by
the immune system [54]. Similarly, Foersch and collaborators could convincingly demonstrate that mice with either impaired induction of cellular senescence or impaired anti-tumor immune response (ATIR) showed a significantly higher tumor count, as well as a significantly higher tumor burden compared to control animals. Clinical importance of bevacizumab-mediated senescence induction following VEGF targeting could be underlined in the concluding part of the corresponding study by showing that VEGF targeting by bevacizumab is proficient to induce cellular senescence in colorectal cancer patients and that, most importantly, VEGF inhibition-dependent tumor cell senescence is associated with improved progression-free survival.

3.3. Ephrin (Eph) receptors as regulators of premature senescence

The role of the Eph RTKs and their cognate ephrin ligands in controlling cell-to-cell communication, cell adhesion and migration in normal physiology as well as in cancer progression is well documented [86]. Interestingly, in 2013, two independent studies reported a novel role of the Ephrin B3 and EPH Receptor A3 (EPHA3) ephrin family members in regulating the onset of cellular senescence in models of human lung adenocarcinomas [87, 88]. By using a high-content siRNA screening assay to identify regulators of premature senescence in the untransformed hTERT-immortalized retinal pigmented epithelial line hTERT-RPE1, Lahtela and collaborators identified 12 senescence-regulating kinases (encoded by the AURKA, CDK1, CSNK1A1, EPHA3, KSR2, LATS1, MAP2K3, MAP4K1, MYLK, NEK1, PIK3C2A and SMG1 genes) and determined their senescence marker signatures based on the ability of their knockdown to induce loss of the proliferation marker Ki67 and decreased nuclei counts, combined

25with an average increase in nuclear size of hTERT-RPE1 cells [88]. The hits that emerged from the siRNA screening were further validated in follow-up assays detecting SA-β-Gal senescence biomarker, γH2AX foci formation as well as p53 and/or p16 expression. One of the possible novel senescence regulators identified in this study was the EPHA3, encoded by a gene that is among the most frequently mutated genes in human lung adenocarcinomas and colorectal cancers [89, 90]. Consistent with this, and with recent data reporting a striking loss of the EPHA3 gene in 42% of primary lung adenocarcinomas [91], single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) data showed frequent loss of the chromosome 3 arm encoding EPHA3 in the lung cancer dataset in particular. From a mechanistic perspective, the senescence phenotype observed upon loss of EPHA3 seems to be regulated in a p16- and p53-dependent manner, as EPHA3 knockdown-induced senescence can be partially rescued by concomitant p16INK4a and p53 depletion [88]. Collectively, these data suggest that concomitant loss of EPHA3 and key senescence-inducing tumor suppressors such as p53 and p16 may act cooperatively to promote tumorigenesis by impairing induction of senescence.

In a study published in 2005, the group of Zhivotovsky reported that combination of IR and the staurosporine analog PKC412, but not Ro 31–8220, sensitized NSCLC cells to IR-induced apoptotic cell death [92]. Few years later, the same group carried out a total gene profiling of the NSCLC cell line U-1810 after IR alone or in combination with either PKC412 or Ro 31–8220, using the Affymetrix-based gene array to explore potential key signaling events conferring RT responsiveness or resistance in NSCLC cells [87]. The genes that showed altered expression in response to IR alone and to IR in combination

26with either PKC 412 or Ro 31-8220 were subsequently filtered for genes associated

with pathways regulated by IR and validated by real-time quantitative PCR. Interestingly,

among these genes, a robust downregulation of the Eph receptor ligand Ephrin B3 was

suggested as a potential cell death-inducing mechanism of combined treatment with IR

and PKC 412. Indeed, siRNA-mediated Ephrin B3 suppression demonstrated a role of

this protein in NSCLC proliferation and cell death in response to IR. More specifically,

Ephrin B3 knockdown reduced proliferation and increased cell death of irradiated U-

1810 cells. Interestingly, analysis of the cell cycle distribution of U-1810 cells post IR

revealed that Ephrin B3 suppression mitigated IR-induced G2 arrest and resulted in

higher percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase, known to represent one of the features

of senescent cells. In line with this observation, the authors further showed that Ephrin

B3 silencing alone and particularly in combination with IR caused cellular senescence as

demonstrated by accumulation of SA-βGal-positive cells with flattened cell shape and

increased cell size. Mechanistically, the radiosensitizing effect of Ephrin B3 knockdown

was shown to be mediated by downregulation of the MAPK and AKT signaling cascades

and a concomitant upregulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup>,

providing an alternative mechanism for the execution of cellular senescence in the p53-

negative U-1810 cells. Taken together, the data arising from this study contribute to a

better understanding of the relevance of both senescence and apoptosis to tumor cell

response to IR and further supported the existence of p53- and p16-independent

pathways involved in senescence execution.

In 2015, a study from Staquicini and collaborators further supported the involvement of

an ephrin family member in regulating the onset of cellular senescence in both *in vitro*and in vivo models of lung cancer [93]. More specifically, after confirming the expression  
of the EphA5 RTK in lung cancer cells and in a large cohort of patient-derived samples,  
the authors were able to demonstrate that shRNA-mediated EphA5 targeting sensitized  
lung cancer cells to IR-induced DNA damage by a simultaneous induction of cell death  
and senescence. Mechanistically, EphA5 was shown to interact with key players of the  
DDR machinery such as the serine-threonine kinase ATM in response to a genotoxic  
insult and to dictate the terminal fate of IR-exposed lung cancer cells to either  
senescence or cell death based on the presence or absence of p53, respectively. By  
using p53-deficient and p53-proficient human lung cancer cells, they observed that  
following EphA5 knockdown, p53-proficient cells became senescent while p53-deficient  
cells underwent cell death in response to IR. Furthermore, EphA5 targeting by the  
monoclonal antibody 11C12 in vivo was shown to improve the overall survival of  
irradiated mice bearing human lung cancer xenografts. Interestingly, while quantification  
of apoptotic cells in tumor specimens revealed low rates of apoptosis in tumors treated  
with a combination of 11C12 and IR, a remarkable, 40-fold increase in the number of  
senescent cells (as indicated by SA-βGal activity in tissue sections) was observed,  
suggesting that a combination of cell death and senescence mechanisms contributes to  
the therapeutic effect of EphA5 targeting.

The studies by Stahl, Lahtela and Staquicini propose involvement of Ephrin B3, EPHA3  
and EphA5, respectively, in the regulation of cellular senescence – by interfering with  
their activity, the authors report induction of senescence in the respective model  
systems. Interestingly, although the ephrin/Eph receptor signaling axis has been mostly  
associated with tumor growth, invasiveness, angiogenesis and metastasis both in vitro  
and in vivo [86, 94], studies on EPHA3 are classifying this gene as a tumor suppressor where its loss contributes to tumorigenesis [91, 95]. The apparent paradox that EPHA3 knockdown triggers senescence could be possibly evaluated in the view of existence of at least two groups of tumor suppressor genes with respect to their role in senescence: those that are functioning downstream of oncogenes and are inducing senescence in presence of excessive oncogenic signaling and those that act upstream of oncogenes, constantly preventing their excessive action [50]. In the first case scenario, a loss of a tumor suppressor impairs senescence and allows progression to malignancy whereas loss of tumor suppressors acting upstream of oncogenes results in activation of oncogene-induced senescence. As inferred from other studies implicating diverse roles of a particular gene depending on cellular context, further research is needed to complexly elucidate the role of genes such as EPHA3 in cancer progression and in regulation of cellular senescence.

3.4. Hepatocyte growth factor receptor (MET), fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFRs), AXL and cellular senescence

Alongside the well-established concept of targeting the MET RTK signaling in various types of cancer due to its growth factor receptor properties [96], a growing body of mechanistic evidence exists that supports a crosstalk between MET and DDR pathways, advocating thereby MET as a potential target for tumor sensitization towards IR and other DDAs commonly used as anticancer modalities (reviewed in [97]).
One of the tumor classes where MET signaling is frequently deregulated and its aberrant expression correlates with poor prognosis is gastric cancer [98, 99]. In a recent study that aimed at investigating the impact of MET inhibition on irradiated models of human gastric cancer driven by aberrant MET signaling, Francica and colleagues reported for the first time that MET targeting potentiates the antitumor effect of IR by promoting cellular senescence rather than cell death [73]. Interestingly, in a panel of MET-addicted human gastric cancer cell lines, MET inhibition by the small molecule inhibitor tepotinib (MSC 2156119, Merck) along with IR did not primarily promote cell death. Instead, irradiated cells pre-treated with tepotinib displayed clear features of cellular senescence, such as enhanced SA-βGal staining, enlarged and flattened cellular morphology, impaired cell proliferation and increased H3K9me3 and γH2AX levels. These in vitro observations were also substantiated by establishing xenograft tumor models where MET inhibition in combination with IR caused a significant decrease in tumor cell proliferation, as indicated by reduction in both Ki67 staining and tumor size, upregulation of γH2AX and enhanced SA-βGal staining. In their attempt to study the relevance of the p53 and the p16-RB signal transduction pathways to MET targeting-dependent senescence activation, the authors observed different expression profiles of the respective downstream CDK inhibitors p21 and p16 across the human gastric cell lines included in the study, indicating alternative pathways regulating the senescence program. Of note, the absence of p53 and/or p16, which often occurs in human cancer, did not exclude the possibility of irradiated gastric cancer cells to undergo senescence following MET inhibition, suggesting that in tumors that have mutated either of these genes, induction of senescence executed by an alternative pathway could still represent a potential outcome in response to anticancer strategies.
30
Notably, MET targeting-associated senescence phenotype was shown to link to blockade of the MAPK pathway and consequent downregulation of the Forkhead box protein M1 (FOXM1) transcription factor, a key promoter of DNA repair and at the same time a prime negative senescence program mediator. Indeed, ectopic expression of FOXM1 in gastric cancer cells abrogated MET inhibition-dependent induction of senescence following IR and conferred a significant growth advantage despite MET blockade (Figure 3). From a translational perspective, assessment of MET and FOXM1 protein levels in a cohort of gastric cancer tissue microarrays and analysis of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database showed that alterations of MET and FOXM1 co-occur in a substantial subset of patients with gastric cancer, thus underlining the potential relevance of cellular senescence for the clinical outcome upon future implementation of anti-MET targeted therapy.

Even though their role in regulating the onset of cellular senescence has still to be investigated in cancer models, inhibition of the FGFRs and the AXL RTK was reported to promote induction of senescence in various cellular models [100, 101]. In their attempt to elucidate the role of the FGFRs in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), Coutu and collaborators provided evidences that FGFR1/2 signaling through the PI3K/AKT pathway promotes the proliferation of MSCs mainly by inhibiting cellular senescence [100]. Indeed, MSCs expanded in vitro without FGF-2 stimulation and displayed distinct characteristics of cellular senescence such as decreased proliferation, increased cell diameter and SA-βGal activity. Further experiments that aimed at investigating the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed phenotype, showed that FGF-2 promoted hyperphosphorylation and consequent activation of the p53 negative regulator

MDM2 in a PI3K/AKT-dependent manner, therefore leading to the inhibition of the senescence program.

In a following study, Jin and collaborators reported a novel role for AXL and its ligand, the growth arrest-specific protein 6 (GAS 6), in delaying the onset of cellular senescence in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) [101]. By establishing cellular models of replicative and prematurely-induced senescence, they found that VSMCs cells stimulated with GAS 6 displayed decreased SA-βGal staining and decreased expression of the two CDK inhibitors p21 and p16 as compared to unstimulated control cells. Analogously, inhibition of AXL activity by the small molecule specific inhibitor R428 resulted in increased SA-βGal activity as well as in increased levels of p21 and p16 regardless of whether GAS 6 was added or not. Analysis of the signaling pathways downstream of GAS 6 and AXL revealed that the PI3K/Akt/FOXO3a signaling cascade regulates the onset of cellular senescence in VSMCs cells. Indeed, R428-treated cells displayed lower expression levels of PI3K, p-AKT and p-FOXO3a, whereas the levels of the CKD inhibitor p27 increased significantly.

Given the established role of FGFR and AXL aberrant signaling in driving the proliferation and invasion of various types of cancers, many different strategies have been successfully developed thus far to target their activity [102, 103]. However, as aforementioned, the contribution of cellular senescence to the reported antitumor effects of FGFR and AXL targeting remains to be further explored.

4. Conclusions / Future directions

Senescence, identified initially as a process that limits the number of cell divisions that human somatic cells undergo, was later on shown to occur also prematurely in response to various types of stress, such as overexpression of oncogenes, chromatin perturbation, DNA damage and oxidative stress, with the final goal of removing damaged cells from a proliferative state. As previously discussed, premature senescence has also been identified as a critical component of cellular response to anticancer therapies such as conventional chemotherapeutic drugs and IR following induction of DNA breaks or by stalling replication forks [27]. Similarly, numerous experimental evidences have recently highlighted the relevance of cellular senescence as a tumor cell response to inhibition of several RTKs systems in various cancer models (Figure 4). Importantly, some of the reported observations are still rather only correlative and the underlying molecular mechanisms need to be further investigated. At the same time it is necessary to state that the capacity of researchers to determine whether in these cases senescence is directly responsible for drug action is currently limited due to the absence of any direct specific approach to inhibit its onset.

Based on a growing body of studies supporting a protective role of certain RTK systems towards DDAs [97, 104, 105], it is not surprising that RTKs targeting strategies exert their antitumor effects via induction of cellular senescence. As well documented in the literature, a sustained activation of the DDR machinery in response to DNA damage can either results in repair of damaged DNA or, if the damage is too extensive, induction of cell death (in the form of apoptosis, necrosis or mitotic catastrophe), temporary cell cycle
arrest or premature senescence [106]. Even though it is not yet completely clear what determines whether cells undergo cell death or senescence in response to genotoxic insults, both biological processes were shown to be unique or concomitant critical components of the tumor cell response to various anticancer approaches, including RTKs targeting strategies, and to be associated with treatment success [33, 50, 70, 107]. However, the beneficial effect of senescence as a potential outcome in response to anticancer treatments has also generated a long debate featuring two critical points. First, the possibility that senescent cells could eventually re-enter cell cycle, for instance as a consequence of a loss of effectors involved in the maintenance of senescence, have raised concerns about its lasting therapeutic impact, even though reversal of senescence in mouse fibroblasts through lentiviral suppression of p53 was shown to lead only to few cell divisions before causing apoptosis [108]. Second, the complex signaling network triggered by SASP can be very diverse and has neither pro-nor antitumorigenic effects. In this respect it has been shown that either co-cultures with or growth in conditioned media originated from senescent fibroblasts promote proliferation and malignant transformation of premalignant epithelial cells [59, 60]. However, this concept is challenged by other studies reporting clearance of senescent cells by immune system cells such as NKs and CD4+ T cells [54, 61, 62]. In some cases, factors secreted by senescent cells such as Interleukin-6 and Interleukin-8 have been shown to activate a self-amplifying secretory mechanism that reinforces the growth arrest, or to stimulate the innate immune system, hence triggering tumor clearance in vivo [10, 54, 109]. In the context of RTKs inhibition-associated senescence the effects of the signaling network triggered by SASP have still to be investigated to better understand the long-term effects of senescent cells in response to RKTs targeting strategies.

34As aforementioned, induction as well as maintenance of the senescence program is tightly regulated by the p53 and p16-RB signaling cascades, which act either separately or in cooperation in order to integrate stress signals and to activate appropriate cellular responses [5]. The therapeutic potential of cellular senescence in response to RTK targeting strategies is highlighted by several studies indicating that the loss of p53 and/or p16 function often occurring in tumors, does not exclude the possibility of tumor cells to undergo senescence, thus providing an antitumor mechanism also in cells with compromised p53 or p16 activity [70-73, 82, 88].

The therapeutic outcome of currently used anticancer treatments such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy as well as RTKs targeting strategies is mostly determined by a complex interplay of different cellular mechanisms including apoptosis, mitotic catastrophe, autophagy and senescence. Even though it is not yet completely clear what determines a particular cell fate, it has been repeatedly reported that induction of cell death in comparison to senescence is generally most prominent using higher drug doses, hence highlighting a potential role of cellular senescence in reducing drug toxicity-related side effects. Accordingly, therapy-induced senescence could represent a potentially alternative treatment outcome that leads tumor growth control and allows patients to maintain a better quality of life during therapy. Given the importance of cellular senescence in determining the overall outcome of various anticancer strategies, future studies will be needed to elucidate its relative contribution in both in vitro and in vivo settings. To that end, important issues remain to be addressed, especially the ability to enable an efficient detection and measurement of the senescence response in

35
vivo, with the final aim of identifying suitable senescence biomarkers also for clinical applications.

Figure legends:

Figure 1. Regulation of senescence by the p53 and the p16-RB signaling pathways. The senescence program is predominantly established and maintained by the p53 and the p16-RB signal transduction cascades, which converge in the activation of the CDKs inhibitors p21 and p16 with crucial functions in regulating the onset of cellular senescence. Both p21 and p16 execute a stable cell cycle arrest by keeping RB in an active, hypophosphorylated form, thereby preventing E2F from transcribing genes that are required for cell cycle progression. As a consequence, high levels of p21 and/or p16 are typically found in senescence cells as a result of increased p53 stability and downregulation of the BMI-1 member of the polycomb family responsible for p16 suppression, respectively. (Figure composed using Motifolio Inc. diagrams.)

Figure 2. Schematic representation of different cellular responses following DNA damage. The presence of DNA lesions is sensed and transmitted by the DNA damage sensors to the numerous transducers and effectors of the DNA damage response machinery which coordinates checkpoint regulation and blocks cell cycle progression to allow sufficient time for DNA repair. If the damage is too severe and it cannot be repaired, damaged cells can be either eliminated by cell death or silenced by induction of an irreversible cell cycle arrest (senescence). (Figure composed using Motifolio Inc. diagrams.)

Figure 3. Schematic representation of MET targeting-dependent radiosensitization of MET-addicted gastric cancer cells via induction of DNA damage-induced

senescence. A) Activated MET signaling results in the activation of downstream pathways including the MAPK pathway, which leads to the phosphorylation and consequent translocation of FOXM1 to the nucleus. Here, the transcriptional activity of FOXM1 results in the expression of genes such as BRIP1 and Bmi-1 involved in DNA repair and inhibition of cellular senescence, respectively. B) Upon MET inhibition via tepotinib, FOXM1 is downregulated. As a consequence, since DNA damage repair is impaired and the major negative regulator of the senescence program is no longer activated, cancer cells are primarily undergoing senescence following genotoxic stress such as IR. (Figure composed using Motifolio Inc. diagrams.)

Figure 4. A model illustrating the proposed mechanisms of various RTK systems in regulating the onset of cellular senescence. The MAPK and the PI3K pathways function as a barrier to senescence by inhibiting the expression of several CDK inhibitors such as p16, p21 and p27. Inhibition of RTKs activity by antibodies, small molecule inhibitors or RNAi causes downregulation of the MAPK or the PI3K pathway, consequently leading to increased expression of the CDK inhibitors responsible for the senescence-associated irreversible cell cycle arrest. (Figure composed using Motifolio Inc. diagrams.)
