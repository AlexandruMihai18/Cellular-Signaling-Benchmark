## ABSTRACT  

Carcinogenesis is a multistep process involving mutation and the subsequent selective clonal expansion of the mutated cell. Chemical and physical agents including those that induce reactive oxygen species can induce and/or modulate this multistep process. Several modes of action by which carcinogens induce cancer have been identified, including through production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Oxidative damage to cellular macromolecules can arise through overproduction of ROS and faulty antioxidant and/or DNA repair mechanisms. In addition, ROS can stimulate signal transduction pathways and lead to activation of key transcription factors such as Nrf2 and NF-kB. The resultant altered gene expression patterns evoked by ROS contribute to the carcinogenesis process. Recent evidence demonstrates an association between a number of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in oxidative DNA repair genes and antioxidant genes with human cancer susceptibility. These aspects of ROS biology will be discussed in the context of their relationship to carcinogenesis.

## MULTISTEP CARCINOGENESIS  

The induction of cancer by chemicals involves a multistage, multistep process. While this process involves multiple molecular and cellular events that transform a normal cell to a malignant neoplastic cell, evidence in recent years has defined multiple stages or steps in the chemical carcinogenesis process. Two of the early steps in the process are of particular interest to our group: initiation and promotion. Initiation results when a normal cell sustains a DNA mutation that, when proceeded by a round of DNA synthesis, results in fixation of the mutation, producing an initiated cell. Production of the initiated mutated cell can occur through interaction with physical carcinogens such as UV light and radiation, as well as chemical carcinogens. The term *genotoxic agent* is thus applied to both physical and chemical carcinogens that directly damage DNA and possess mutagenic properties. In addition, recent evidence has suggested that during normal cell proliferation and DNA synthetic processes, mutations may be acquired through misrepair of damaged DNA resulting in spontaneous initiated mutated cells. Following formation of initiated cells, chemicals as well as endogenous physiological events can influence the subsequent selective clonal growth of initiated cell populations through the process of tumor promotion. Tumor promotion in the liver involves the expansion of initiated cells to histologically defined focal lesions. While the promotion process does not involve DNA reactivity or damage, a hallmark of this stage is the modulation of gene expression resulting in increased cell number either through cell division and/or decrease in apoptotic cell death (Klaunig and Kamendulis 2007). Following additional chemical insults or through multiple divisions and

## RODENT HEPATIC CANCER MODE OF ACTION  

The mechanisms by which carcinogens induce their effects have been studied extensively for over half a century. Using the rodent liver model as an example, the modes of action by which carcinogens induce hepatic cancer can be categorized based upon molecular targets and cellular effects that include genotoxic (DNA reactive) and nongenotoxic mechanisms (Table 1). Genotoxicity reflects the interaction of the agent or its metabolite with genomic DNA resulting in mutational events. Agents that act through genotoxicity usually function at the initiation or progression stage of the cancer process. Besides genotoxicity, a number of nongenotoxic modes of action have been ascribed to a variety of chemical agents that induce cancer following chronic exposure in rodents. Nongenotoxic agents can be cytotoxic or mitogenic and may act through specific receptor-mediated pathways. Cytotoxicity, in the case of the liver, is produced by compounds such as chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, which at relatively high doses will induce hepatocyte necrosis and damage resulting in a compensatory hyperplasia enabling the liver to replace damaged cells. Spontaneous mutations can be acquired as a result of enhanced cell proliferation or the clonal expansion of initiated cells, events that may ultimately lead to tumor formation. Compounds that work through cytotoxic mechanisms thus function at the promotion stage where they either enhance already formed spontaneous initiated cells and/or can induce new initiated cells through compensatory hyperplasia (Klaunig and Kamendulis 2007).

Receptor-mediated pathways stimulated by exposure to hepatic carcinogens have received increased attention in recent years. Four major receptors have been identified in the liver that appear to participate in hepatic carcinogenesis: constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα), aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and the estrogen receptor (ER). Agents that bind to and activate these receptors have all been shown to act through nongenotoxic mechanisms and function at the promotion stage of the cancer progress by stimulating cell proliferation. Examples of PPARα agonists include hypolipidemic drugs such as clofibrate, as well as the plasticizer Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Phenobarbital appears to function through activation of CAR. Agents that mimic estrogen, as well as those that modify estrogen metabolism, can bind and activate the ER leading to increased cell proliferation and cancer in rodent liver following chronic treatment. Similarly, agents that function through activation of AhR (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), stimulate dose-and threshold-dependent increases in cell proliferation, or inhibition of apoptosis. In addition, a number of chemical carcinogens produce mitogenic effects in the liver through mechanisms that cannot be ascribed to receptor binding or cytotoxicity. A prominent feature of these agents is the induction of oxidative stress by increasing the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), decreasing the antioxidant capacity and/or oxidative DNA repair capacity of the cell. These mechanisms are detailed further below.

REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES

Recent studies have shown an important role for reactive oxygen species in tumor development (Kumar et al. 2008; Ishikawa et al. 2008). ROS can be produced from endogenous sources, such as from mitochondria, peroxisomes, and inflammatory cell activation (Klaunig and Kamendulis 2004); and exogenous sources, including environmental agents, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals. Figure 1 illustrates the potential outcomes of reactive oxidative species when not counterbalanced by antioxidant defenses of the cell. This oxidative stress then, in turn, may cause DNA, protein, and/or lipid damage, leading to changes in chromosome instability, genetic mutation, and/or modulation of cell growth that may result in cancer.

FIGURE 1.—Reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their role in the development of human cancer.

CHEMISTRY OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES

During mitochondrial oxidative metabolism, the majority of oxygen consumed is reduced to water; however, an estimated 4% to 5% is converted to reactive oxygen species, primarily the superoxide anion (O₂⁻) (St-Pierre et al. 2002; Klaunig and Kamendulis 2004). The superoxide anion can also be produced enzymatically by NADPH oxidase, xanthine oxidase, lipoxygenases and cylooxygenases (Curtin, Donovan, and Cotter 2002). The pathways for intracellular ROS generation are shown in Figure 2A. Superoxide anion is considered the “primary” ROS because it can further interact with molecules in the cell and form “secondary” ROS via enzyme- or metal-catalyzed processes (Fridovich 1986; Valko et al. 2006). Dismutation by superoxide dismutase (SOD) reduces O₂⁻ to hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) generated in this reaction can be converted to hydroxyl free radicals via the Fenton reaction (Winterbourn 1995). Hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions can further react with other molecules in biological systems, leading to the formation of other free radicals (Huie and Neta 1999).

ENDOGENOUS CELLULAR GENERATION OF REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES

Complex I (NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex III (the ubiquinol-cytochrome c oxidoreductase) of the mitochondrial electron transport chain account for the majority of superoxide production in this organelle (St-Pierre et al. 2002). The ROS generated at the ubiquinone cycle of complex III also regulates hypoxic activation of hypoxia inducible factors (HIFs), a family of transcription factors that modulate a broad range of cellular functions including cell proliferation and angiogenesis, processes that are important in tumor development and progression (Bell et al. 2007). While recent work has examined the link between mitochondrial-induced ROS and tumor development (Gottlieb and Tomlinson 2005; Guzy

TOXICOLOGIC PATHOLOGY

### Generation of Reactive Oxygen Species via Reduction of Molecular Oxygen
- $ \mathrm{O}_{2} + \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-} $ (superoxide anion)
- $ \mathrm{O}_{2}^{-} + \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightarrow \mathrm{HO}_{2}^{*} $ (hydroperoxyl radical)
- $ \mathrm{HO}_{2}^{*} + \mathrm{e}^{-} + \mathrm{H} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} $ (hydrogen peroxide)
- $ \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} + \mathrm{e}^{-} \rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{-} + \cdot \mathrm{OH} $ (hydroxyl radical)

### Fenton Reaction
$$
\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} + \mathrm{Fe}^{2+} \rightarrow \mathrm{OH}^{-} + \cdot \mathrm{OH} + \mathrm{Fe}^{3+}
$$

Oxygen radicals are produced by the reduction of molecular oxygen. Of the radicals produced, the hydroxyl radical, hydroperoxyl radical and the superoxide anion are sufficiently reactive and may interact with biomolecules. The Fenton reaction produces hydroxyl radicals, and is catalyzed by transition metals such as Cu(2+), Cr(V) and Ni.

et al. 2008; Ishikawa et al. 2008), the role of mitochondrial-produced ROS in tumor development and progression remains unresolved. ROS production in mitochondria is species, tissue, and cell cycle specific (Ku et al. 1993; Sohal, Sohal, and Orr 1995). In addition, ROS generated from mitochondria of aged cells is higher compared to younger counterparts (Ku et al. 1993) and in general higher in cancer cells than normal cells (Trachootham et al. 2006).

Peroxisomes are organelles that consume oxygen and also contribute to cellular ROS generation. The production of ROS in the peroxisome involves peroxisomal oxidases including acyl-CoA oxidase and xanthine oxidase, which generate hydrogen peroxide and superoxide anions (Schrader and Fahimi 2006). In rat liver, peroxisomes produce approximately 35% of all $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ from normal oxygen consumption (Schrader and Fahimi 2006). Although peroxisomes contain antioxidants such as catalase, glutathione peroxidase, copper zinc superoxide dismutase, and peroxiredoxin I (Asayama et al. 1994; Dhaunsi et al. 1992; Immenschuh et al. 2003), ROS from peroxisomal β-oxidation exceeds that neutralized by antioxidant capacity. Compounds that increase peroxisome number and size such as hypolipidemic drugs, phthalate esters, and halogenated solvents all produce tumors in the liver (Reddy, Azarnoff, and Hignite 1980; Reddy et al. 1983; Moody et al. 1991), suggesting a causal link between peroxisome proliferation-induced ROS and liver tumorigenesis (Klaunig and Kamendulis 2004).

Inflammatory cells including neutrophils, eosinophils, and macrophages also contribute significantly to the cellular ROS burden. Phagocytes produce ROS through NADPH oxidase, a complex composed of two membrane-bound subunits gp91phox and p22phox and three regulatory cytosolic components p47phox, p67phox, and Rac (Babior 1999). Upon activation by a variety of endogenous and exogenous stimuli, phagocytes undergo a respiratory burst leading to transient increases in oxygen uptake and generation of ROS through NADPH oxidase, the enzyme that catalyzes the single electron reduction of oxygen (Griendling, Sorescu, and Ushio-Fukai 2000). The $\mathrm{O}_{2}^{-}$ generated in this reaction can be enzymatically converted to hydrogen peroxide by superoxide dismutase. The ROS produced by this mechanism play an important role in killing bacteria. Besides acting as a cellular defense mechanism, recent studies suggest that phagocyte-derived ROS may also be involved in the development of cancers.

### Exogenous Sources of Reactive Oxygen Species

#### Ionizing Radiation

Ionizing radiation is one of the few established human carcinogens. Ionizing radiation can function at all stages of carcinogenesis, that is, initiation, promotion, and progression, and has been shown to induce cancer in several species, in almost all organs examined (Heidenreich, Jacob, and Paretzke 1997; Heidenreich et al. 2002; Kaiser et al. 2004; Little et al.

2008). The spectrum of damage induced by ionizing radiation includes the induction of apoptosis, as well as DNA damage leading to gene mutation and cancer (Riley 1994). Most of the biological effects of ionizing radiation are mediated by ROS, which are generated rapidly through radiolysis of water molecules and also by secondary reactions, which can persist and diffuse within cells participating in delayed effects (Tulard et al. 2003; Riley 1994; Leach et al. 2001).

chemical that induces liver hemangiosarcomas in male mice (NTP 2000), increases the level of 8-hydroxyguanosine in mouse liver (Siesky, Kamendulis, and Klaunig 2002; Corthals, Kamendulis, and Klaunig 2006). It appears that ROS induced by 2-butoxyethanol may result from Kupffer cell activation secondary to 2-butoxyethanol-induced hemolysis and subsequent hepatic iron deposition (Siesky, Kamendulis, and Klaunig 2002; Corthals, Kamendulis, and Klaunig 2006).

**Environmental Agents**

Environmental agents including non-DNA reactive carcinogens can generate ROS in cells by metabolism to primary radical intermediates or by activating endogenous sources of reactive oxygen species (Rice-Evans and Burdon 1993; Klaunig et al. 1997). The induction of oxidative stress and damage has been observed following exposure to xenobiotics of varied structures and activities (Table 2). Chlorinated compounds, radiation, metal ions, barbiturates, phorbol esters, and some peroxisome-proliferating compounds are among the classes of compounds that induce oxidative stress and damage in vitro and in vivo (Klaunig et al. 1997). Acrylonitrile, which induces brain tumors in rats (Bigner et al. 1986; Johannsen and Levinskas 2002), has been demonstrated to induce oxidative stress in rat brain tissue and cultured rat astrocytes. The resultant oxidative damage includes lipid peroxidation, oxidative DNA damage, and the modulation of antioxidant defense (Jiang, Xu, and Klaunig 1998; Whysner et al. 1998; Kamendulis et al. 1999; Pu, Kamendulis, and Klaunig 2006). 2-Butoxyethanol, a

**Therapeutic Agents and ROS**

One of the common features associated with cancer cells is increased ROS generation. Although most cancer cells exhibit elevated oxidative stress with increased metabolic activity and production of ROS (Szatrowski and Nathan 1991; Trachootham et al. 2006), the mechanism of action for many cancer chemotherapeutic drugs involves ROS-mediated apoptosis. For example, the classic antitumor drugs cisplatin and adriamycin appear to produce ROS at excessive levels, resulting in DNA damage and cell death. Advances in our knowledge of oxidative stress regulation in cancer cells have led to the design of new therapeutic agents. As cancer cells are sensitive to oxidative stress, modulation of SOD has been exploited as a mechanism to selectively kill cancer cells (P. Huang et al. 2000). A number of natural compounds have also been demonstrated to provide promising treatment results. Tocopheryl succinate, a vitamin E analog, for example, is reported to induce ROS generation and kill cancer cells (Y. H. Kang et al. 2004).

C-phycocyanin, a major phycobiliprotein from blue-green algae, induces ROS in AK-5 cells and leads to apoptosis (Pardhasaradhi et al. 2003). A more recent study by Trachootham et al. (2006) demonstrated that β-phenylethyl isothiocyanate (PEITC), a natural compound found in consumable cruciferous vegetables, selectively kills transformed cells while it is less toxic to normal cells. Although these studies were conducted in specific tumor systems or cell lines, further studies on the molecular mechanism of endogenous and exogenous ROS may provide additional insights that would enable their use in cancer therapy.

### ROS IN CARCINOGENESIS

Mutation studies have suggested that chronic oxidative stress, particularly from chronic inflammation, is associated with carcinogenesis (Hwang and Bowen 2007). For example, ulcerative colitis has long been linked with high incidence of colorectal cancer; and chronic gastritis, such as from infection with H. pylori, has been associated with a high incidence of gastric cancer (Seril et al. 2003; Konturek, Konturek, and Brzozowski 2006). In addition to inducing DNA, lipid, and protein damage, oxidative damage to protein-coding or -noncoding RNA may potentially cause errors in protein synthesis or dysregulation of gene expression. This has been proposed as an underlying mechanism of several human diseases, especially chronic degeneration in neurons (Nunomura et al. 2007) Similarly, while protein oxidation has been implicated in a number of aging processes and diseases, most notably Alzheimer's disease (Levine et al. 1994; Aksenov et al. 2001; Balcz et al. 2001), a clear link between protein oxidation and carcinogenesis has not been established. Lipid peroxidation results in the formation of reactive aldehydes, including malondialdehyde (MDA) and 4-hydroxy-2-nonenal (4-HNE), which demonstrate high reactivity with protein and DNA (Tuma 2002; Kikugawa, Taguchi, and Maruyama 1987; Nicholls et al. 1992; Uchida and Stadtman 1993; Klaunig et al. 1998). While MDA and MDA-MDA dimers are mutagenic in bacterial assays (Spalding 1988; Klaunig and Kamendulis 2004), evidence for their contribution to mutational events in humans is lacking. In contrast, oxidative damage to DNA has been linked to aflatoxin B-induced p53 and ras gene mutations in hepatocarcinogenesis (Shen and Ong 1996) in UV-induced mouse and human skin cancers (Nishigori, Hattori, and Toyokuni 2004). In addition, $p15^{INK4B}$ and $p16^{INK4A}$ tumor suppressor genes appear to be targets of ROS-induced renal cell carcinoma in rats (T. Tanaka et al. 1999).

#### Oxidative DNA Damage

Oxidative DNA damage is a major source of the mutation load in living organisms, with more than one hundred oxidative DNA adducts (purine, pyrimidine, and the deoxyribose backbone) having been identified (Lu et al. 2001; von Sonntag 1987; Dizdaroglu 1992; Demple and Harrison 1994). The estimated frequency of oxidative DNA damage in human cells is $10^4$ lesions/cell/day (Fraga et al. 1990; Lu et al. 2001). Being highly reactive, the hydroxyl radical is the predominant ROS that targets DNA (Lu et al. 2001). Hydrogen peroxide, a precursor to hydroxyl radical, is less reactive and more readily diffusible and thus more likely to be involved in the formation of oxidized bases through Fenton and Haber-Weiss reactions (Guyton and Kensler 1993; Barber and Harris 1994). ROS-induced DNA damage can result in single- or double-strand breakage, base modifications, deoxyribose modification, and DNA cross-linking. Cell death, DNA mutation, replication errors, and genomic instability can occur if the oxidative DNA damage is not repaired prior to DNA replication (Marnett 2000; J. P. Cooke 2003; Klaunig and Kamendulis 2004; Valko et al. 2006).

The most extensively studied and most abundant oxidative DNA lesion produced is 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), which is mutagenic in bacterial and mammalian cells (Cheng et al. 1992; see Figure 2B). Numerous studies have demonstrated that 8-OHdG levels are elevated in various human cancers (Miyake et al. 2004; Weiss et al. 2005; Diakowska et al. 2007; H. Tanaka et al. 2008) and in animal models of tumors (Gottschling et al. 2001; Muguruma et al. 2007). 8-OHdG in its stable syn conformation can pair with both cytosine and adenine. If the A:G mismatch is not repaired, a G:C to T:A transversion will occur, commonly found in mutated oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (Shibutani, Takeshita, and Grollman 1991; Cheng et al. 1992; Grollman and Moriya 1993). During DNA replication, ROS can also react with dGTP in the nucleotide pool to form OH8dG. Therefore, in addition to the G:C to T:A caused by 8-OHdG in the DNA template, it is postulated that during DNA replication, OH8dG in the nucleotide pool can be incorporated into DNA opposite dC or dA on the template strand, resulting in A:T to C:G transversions (Cheng et al. 1992; Demple and Harrison 1994).

Based on this evidence, 8-OHdG has been widely used as a biomarker of oxidative DNA damage, and measurement of 8-OHdG level is applied to evaluate the load of oxidative stress (Gao et al. 2004; Hwang and Bowen 2007). In addition, RNS, produced during the process of chronic inflammation, can cause nitratived DNA damage to form 8-nitroguanine. The formation of 8-nitroguanine has been observed in various human samples, and experimental evidence has suggested that 8-nitroguanine is a mutagenic DNA lesion, which preferentially leads to G→T transversions (Kawanishi and Hiraku 2006). The assessment of oxidative DNA damage products in various biological matrices, such as serum and/or urinary 8-OHdG or 8-nitroguanine, could be important to understanding the role of oxidative stress in cancer development and disease intervention. Accurate and reliable measurement of oxidative damage to lipid, protein, and DNA are important in the evaluation of the extent and distribution of ROS-induced damage in the disease processes.

### ROS MODULATION OF GENE EXPRESSION

While much effort has been made on understanding the effects of ROS on DNA damage and induction of mutations, the role of ROS on epigenetic effects has also been studied (Evans, Dizdaroglu, and Cooke 2004). Upon exposure to oxidants or oxidative stress-inducing agents, a common adaptive

response induced in mammalian cells is the upregulation of stress-response genes, many of which encode antioxidant defense enzymes. While high levels of ROS production may lead to the induction of apoptosis or necrosis, increasing evidence demonstrates that low or transient ROS exposure increases cell proliferation, likely through altered expression of growth factors and proto-oncogenes (Frenkel 1992; Fiorani et al. 1995).

As previously described, it is clear that many xenobiotics increase cellular levels of ROS through varied mechanisms. ROS-induced alteration of gene expression can occur through a modulation of a host of signaling pathways including cAMP-mediated cascades, calcium-calmodulin pathways, and intracellular signal transducers such as nitric oxide (Shi, Shi, and Liu 2004; Bertin and Averbeck 2006). Studies have also shown that ROS can release calcium from intracellular stores, resulting in the activation of kinases, such as protein kinase C (PKC), which regulates a variety of cell functions including proliferation, cell cycle, differentiation, cytoskeletal organization, cell migration, and apoptosis (Wu 2006). While PKC can also be activated by ROS (Frank and Eguchi 2003), the activation of PKC is required to generate ROS to inhibit gap junction intercellular communication (Lin and Takemoto 2005). Interestingly, the activation of PKC seems to be differentially regulated by cellular oxidants: oxidation at the NH2-terminal regulatory domain activates PKC, whereas oxidation at the COOH terminal inactivates PKC (Gopalakrishna and Anderson 1989). Similarly, H₂O₂ activates protein kinases such as extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 (Zhou et al. 2007), phosphoinositide 3-kinase/serine-threonine kinase (P13K/Akt) (L. Z. Liu et al. 2006), protein kinase B (PKB) (Mehdi, Azar, and Srivastava 2007), and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) (Wu 2006). Because these pathways regulate cellular migration, proliferation, survival, and death responses, their aberrant activation has been suggested to be a potential mechanism of ROS-induced carcinogenesis.

The effects of cellular oxidants have also been related to activation of transcription factors. The most significant effects of oxidants on signaling pathways have been observed in the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NF-E2/rf2 or Nrf2) (Kensler, Wakabayashi, and Biswal 2007), mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase/AP-1 (Benhar, Engelberg, and Levitzki 2002), and NF-κB pathways (Pantano et al. 2006) as well as hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1α (HIF-1α; Rankin and Giaccia 2008). The cellular concentration of ROS appears to influence the selective activation of these transcription factors and therefore may help explain the observation that either cell death or cell proliferation may result from exposure to oxidative stress.

Nrf2

Nrf2 is a basic region-leucine zipper (b-Zip)-type transcription factor, which heterodimerizes with members of the small Maf family of transcription factors. Subsequent binding to antioxidant response elements (AREs) in gene promoters leads to the induction of ARE-regulated genes (Itoh et al.

1997). Under basal unstressed conditions, Keap1 (Kelch ECH associating protein 1), a cytosolic Nrf2 repressor protein, binds to Nrf2 and promotes its proteasomal degradation through Cullin 3 (Cul-3)-based E3 ligase (Cullinan et al. 2004). Upon exposure to environmental stressors such as ROS or electrophiles, Keap1 undergoes a conformational change, liberating Nrf2 from Keap1, resulting in translocation to the nucleus (Itoh et al. 1999). The Nrf2-Keap1 system has been observed in virtually all vertebrates, suggesting that Nrf2 is a highly conserved cellular defense mechanism (Kobayashi and Yamamoto 2006).

The mechanisms for activation of Nrf2 have been intensively investigated since its isolation in 1994 (Moi et al. 1994). A number of endogenous and exogenous stressors have been reported to activate Nrf2 (e.g., ROS, RNS, lipid aldehydes, 15-deoxy-D12,14-prostaglandin J2, electrophilic xenobiotics and their metabolites; Dinkova-Kostova, Holtzclaw, and Kensler 2005; Osburn and Kensler 2007). Two independent mechanisms have been identified for the dissociation of Nrf2 from Keap1 (reviewed by Osburn and Kensler 2007). Keap1 contains reactive cysteines (C273 and C288) that form protein-protein crosslinks through intermolecular disulfide bonds upon exposure to electrophiles or oxidant stress. The resulting conformational change leads to the disruption of the Keap1-Nrf2 interaction and liberation of Nrf2 (Wakabayashi et al. 2004). Secondly, activation of protein kinases, such as PKC, results in phosphorylation of Nrf2, which enhances the stability and/or release of Nrf2 from Keap1 (H. C. Huang, Nguyen, and Pickett 2002).

The activation of Nrf2 results in transcriptional expression of a broad spectrum of protective enzymes including those involved in xenobiotic detoxification, antioxidative response, and proteome maintenance (Kensler, Wakabayashi, and Biswal 2007). The major antioxidant enzymes induced include glutathione reductase, peroxiredoxin, thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase, catalase, copper/zinc superoxide dismutase, and glutathione peroxidase (Osburn and Kensler 2007). Low levels of Nrf2 or loss of Nrf2 activity appears to increase ROS production and DNA damage and predisposes cells to tumorigenesis. However, elevated activity of Nrf2 may also play a role in the evolution of cancer (Hayes and McMahon 2006). In two separate studies, mutations in Keap1 were shown to provide a growth advantage for lung cancer cells (Ohta et al. 2008) and breast cancer cells (Nioi and Nguyen 2007). Biallelic inactivation of Keap1 appears as a frequent genetic event in non-small-cell lung cancer. Loss of function of Keap1 led to constitutive activation of Nrf2-mediated gene expression, favoring the cancer cell survival against chemotherapeutic agents (Singh et al. 2006), suggesting a potential mechanism for chemoresistance in certain cancers.

AP-1

Activation protein-1 (AP-1) was first identified as a transcription factor that contributes both to basal gene expression (Lee, Mitchell, and Tjian 1987), as well as phorbol

ester- (TPA-) inducible gene expression (Angel et al. 1987). AP-1 is a collection of dimeric bZip proteins that belong to the Jun (c-Jun, JunB, JunD), Fos (FosB, Fra-1, Fra-2), Maf (musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma), and ATF (activating transcription factor) subfamilies, all of which can bind TPA or cAMP response elements (Chinenov and Kerppola 2001). AP-1 activity can be induced by H₂O₂, cytokines, and other physical and chemical stressors. In addition, in vitro transcriptional activity of AP-1 is regulated by the redox state of cysteine 64, which is located at the interface between the two c-Jun subunits, highlighting the importance of redox status on gene transcription (Klatt et al. 1999). The induction of AP-1 is mediated mainly by the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38MAP kinase cascades (Chang and Karin 2001). Once activated, JNK proteins translocate to the nucleus and phosphorylate c-Jun and ATF2, enhancing transcriptional activity (Gupta et al. 1995; Karin 1995). ROS can activate MAP kinases and thereby AP-1 through several mechanisms. First, oxidation of thioredoxin by H₂O₂ results in activation of apoptosis signal regulating kinase, or ASK1, which then leads to activation of JNK (H. Liu et al. 2000; Tobiume et al. 2001). Secondly, oxidants can elicit an inhibitory effect on MAP kinase phosphatases, leading to increased MAP kinase activation. In addition, ROS may activate MAP kinases via the PKC pathway (Wu 2006). One common effect of AP-1 activation is an increased cell proliferation due to increased expression of growth-stimulatory genes such as cyclin D1 (Brown et al. 1998) and suppression of p21waf, a protein that inhibits cell cycle progression (Bakiri et al. 2000). JunB, considered a negative regulator of c-jun-induced cell proliferation, represses c-jun-induced cyclin D1 activation by the transcription of p16INK4a (Passegue and Wagner 2000). Although JunD exhibits high sequence homology to c-Jun, its biological consequences of expression and activity are distinct from those of c-Jun (Castellazzi et al. 1991). While most reported functions of JunD are related to decreased cellular oxidative stress, recent reports show that JunD can inhibit cell proliferation through activation of p21 promoter and reduce tumor angiogenesis by protecting cells from oxidative stress (L. Li et al. 2002; Gerald et al. 2004).

NF-κB

NF-κB is a nuclear transcription factor that was first identified by Sen and Baltimore in 1986. It is ubiquitously expressed and participates in a wide range of biological processes involved in cell survival, differentiation, inflammation, and growth (Sethi, Sung, and Aggarwal 2008). This dimeric transcription factor is composed of different members of the Rel family, consisting of p50 (NF-κB1), p52 (NF-κB2), c-Rel, v-Rel, Rel A (p65), and Rel B (Baeuerle and Baltimore 1996). Normally, NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm in an inactive state through binding to inhibitory IkB proteins. Activation of NF-κB occurs in response to a wide spectrum of extracellular stimuli that promote the dissociation of IκBs by sequential phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation, a process that depends on the IκB kinase (IKK) complex. Degradation of IκB proteins allows the entry of NF-κB into the nucleus where it binds κB-regulatory elements (Hacker and Karin 2006). NF-κB is a direct target for oxidation, which can affect its ability to bind to DNA (Pantano et al. 2006). In addition, NF-κB activation has been linked to the carcinogenesis process through promotion of angiogenesis and tumor cell invasion and metastasis (Sethi, Sung, and Aggarwal 2008).

HIF-1

HIF-1 is a heterodimeric transcription factor that plays an important role in signaling the cellular oxygen levels. HIF-1 consists of two subunits, HIF-1α (120 kDa) and HIF-1β (91–94 kDa), which belong to the basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins of the PAS family. HIF-1β (also known as ARNT) is expressed constitutively in all cells and does not respond to changes in oxygen tension, and it is essential for hypoxia-induced transcriptional changes mediated by the HIF-1 heterodimer (G. L. Wang et al. 1995). The level of HIF-1α is tightly controlled by the cellular oxygen level. HIF-1α is produced continuously and accumulates in hypoxic cells but is rapidly degraded and nearly absent in normoxic cells. The oxygen-dependent degradation of HIF-1α is sensed by prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), and following hydroxylation, HIF-1α is recognized by the von Hippel-Lindau (pVHL, the E3 ubiquitin protein ligase) and undergoes proteasomal degradation (Ivan et al. 2001).

HIF-1 has been implicated in ROS-induced carcinogenesis in a variety of human tumors, including bladder, breast, colon, glial, hepatocellular, ovarian, pancreatic, prostate, and renal tumors (Talks et al. 2000). Elevated HIF-1 expression has been shown to correlate with poor outcome in patients with head and neck cancer; nasopharyngeal carcinoma; and colorectal, pancreatic, breast, cervical, osteosarcoma, endometrial, ovarian, bladder, glioblastoma, and gastric carcinomas (for review, see Rankin and Giaccia 2008). Taken together, these findings highlight that HIF-1 activation is a common event in cancer and suggest that HIF-1 may participate in tumorigenesis. Emerging evidence indicates that ROS generated by mitochondrial complex III are required for hypoxic activation of HIF-1 (Klimova and Chandel 2008). Thus, ROS are considered direct activators of HIF-1 in hypoxic tumors.

Activation of transcription factors is clearly stimulated by ROS-mediated signal transduction pathways activation. Through their ability to stimulate cell proliferation and either positive or negative regulation of apoptosis, transcription factors can mediate many of the documented effects of both physiological and pathological exposure ROS and/or conditions that favor increased cellular oxidants. Through regulation of gene transcription factors, and disruption of signal transduction pathways, ROS are intimately involved in the maintenance of concerted networks of gene expression that underlie neoplastic development.

POLYMORPHISMS IN OXIDATIVE STRESS-RELATED GENES AND  
CHEMICAL CARCINOGENESIS  

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) constitute the majority of genetic variation observed in the human population and are defined as a variation in a single nucleotide pair occurring at a population frequency of at least 1%. It is estimated that approximately 10 million SNPs exist in the human genome (Kruglyak and Nickerson 2001). While many of these variants are silent (or “neutral”) (Fay, Wyckoff, and Wu 2002), a small portion of these variants are in coding and regulatory regions of genes, which may contribute to phenotypic changes (Brookes 1999). The effects of genetic polymorphisms in oxidative stress-related genes on cancer susceptibility may be determined by studying functional polymorphisms in genes that control the levels of cellular ROS and oxidative damage, including SNPs for genes involved in carcinogen metabolism (detoxification and/or activation), antioxidants, and DNA repair pathways (Table 3).

**Polymorphisms in Carcinogen Metabolizing Genes and Their Role in Carcinogenesis**

The metabolism of carcinogens has been traditionally categorized into two major categories: phase I and phase II reactions. Following exposure to a carcinogen, phase I reactions, mediated by microsomal oxidases encoded by the cytochrome P450 (CYP) gene superfamily, predominate; however, other enzymes such as epoxide hydrolase 1 (EPHX1) are involved as well. The enzymes all use oxygen in some form, derived from water or molecular oxygen, and generate free chemical groups that can be detoxified through conjugation with phase II enzymes, such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and N-acetyltransferase-2 (NAT2), into water-soluble chemicals. Most carcinogen metabolizing genes are known to be polymorphic, which may alter the activity of the enzyme and, thus, modify the cancer risk of an individual.

CYP constitutes a superfamily of monooxygenases responsible for the phase I metabolism of many endogenous as well as exogenous compounds such as drugs and xenobiotics (Lewis 2001; Lewis, Lake, and Dickins 2004). The main CYPs in humans that metabolize carcinogens are CYP1A1, CYP2A6, CYP1B1, and CYP2E1 (Gonzalez, Aoyama, and Gelboin 1990; Gonzalez 1993). These enzymes have specificities for various classes of carcinogens, and genetic polymorphism has been identified for most (Guengerich, Kim, and Iwasaki 1991; Guengerich 1994; Ingelman-Sundberg 2004). Individual differences in expression may be due to the genetic polymorphisms or the extent of their induction. Numerous studies have investigated the associations of CYP polymorphisms and a variety of human cancers (Agundez 2004).

Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), a major superfamily of phase II metabolic enzymes, metabolize a variety of environmental carcinogens with a large overlap in substrate specificity. GSTs catalyze the conjugation of electrophilic molecules with glutathione and thereby protect cellular macromolecules against toxic foreign chemicals and oxidative stress (Hayes and

Strange 2000). Human GSTs are divided into three major families: the cytosolic, mitochondrial, and microsomal (now referred to as membrane-associated proteins in eicosanoid and glutathione, or MAPEG; Hayes, Flanagan, and Jowsey 2005). Cytosolic GSTs represent the largest family of transferases and are further divided into eight subclasses—Alpha, Pi, Mu, Omega, Sigma, Theta, Zeta, and Kappa—all of which are dimeric with subunits of 199 to 244 amino acids in length (Mannervik et al. 1992; Strange et al. 2001). The chromosomal localization of these genes are reviewed elsewhere (McIlwain, Townsend, and Tew 2006). Most of the cytosolic GSTs have been reported to be polymorphic, which may contribute to the interindividual difference in response to xenobiotics (Hayes, Flanagan, and Jowsey 2005).

**Polymorphisms in Antioxidant Genes**

Antioxidant enzymes constitute one of the major cellular protective mechanisms against oxidative stress in the human body. Many of the antioxidant genes are known to be polymorphic, which can lead to altered enzyme activity. Copper-zinc superoxide dismutase 1 (CuZnSOD or SOD1) occurs as a dimer of identical 16 kDa subunits. Mutations in *SOD1* have been known to cause 5% of all amyotrophic lateral sclerosis cases (Rosen 1993); however, several recent studies reported no correlation between SNPs in *SOD1* and increased breast or prostate cancer risk (Cebrian et al. 2006; Oestergaard et al. 2006; D. Kang et al. 2007; Udler et al. 2007). Manganese superoxide dismutase, MnSOD or SOD2, is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the formation of H₂O₂ from superoxide radicals. The variant allele of MnSOD has been associated with elevated risk of breast (Bewick et al. 2008), prostate (D. Kang et al. 2007), lung (G. Liu et al. 2004), and ovarian (Olson et al. 2004) cancers and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (S. S. Wang et al. 2006). Superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) is a major extracellular antioxidant enzyme expressed in the extracellular matrix of many tissues and especially blood vessels (Marklund 1984). A common genetic variant *SOD(R213G)* with a substitution

in the heparin-binding domain was recently reported to be associated with vascular disease (Chu et al. 2005). However, SNPs in SOD3 were not found to be associated with prostate cancer risk (D. Kang et al. 2007).

The glutathione peroxidases (GPX) are a family of selenium-dependent enzyme with at least four isoenzymes identified to date. GPXI, the first identified and the most abundant selenoprotein in mammals (Kiss et al. 1997), is ubiquitously expressed in humans, protecting cells against oxidative damage by reducing hydrogen peroxide and a wide range of organic peroxides (Arthur 2000). A SNP resulting in a proline-leucine substitution at codon 198 of human GPXI has been identified and has been associated with increased risk of breast (Ravn-Haren et al. 2006), prostate (Arsova-Sarafinovska et al. 2008), lung (Raaschou-Nielsen et al. 2007), and bladder cancer (Ichimura et al. 2004) but is not consistent in all populations (Ahn et al. 2005; Cebrian et al. 2006; Udler et al. 2007).

Catalase (CAT) is an endogenous antioxidant enzyme that neutralizes ROS by converting H₂O₂ into H₂O and O₂ and can be upregulated by oxidative stress (Hunt et al. 1998). A common catalase-262 C/T polymorphism has been identified in the promoter region of human CAT, and the variant of this gene affects transcriptional activity and catalase levels in red blood cells (Forsberg et al. 2001). Because of the importance of this enzyme in regulating ROS levels in human body and the clear role of ROS in tumorigenesis, genetic polymorphisms of this gene are believed to play a role in ROS-induced carcinogenesis. Several epidemiologic studies have investigated the relationship between SNPs of this gene and human cancer risks; however, results remain inconclusive. Polymorphisms of CAT were not associated with lung cancer risk in a Chinese population (Ho et al. 2006), non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in the United Kingdom (Lightfoot et al. 2006), or prostate cancer in the United States (Choi et al. 2007).

results. The variant allele of this SNP was shown to be associated with significantly increased risk of a number of human cancers, including lung (Hung et al. 2005; W. Li and Kong 2008), esophageal (Xing et al. 2001), prostate (Xu et al. 2002), and gastric (Farinati et al. 2008) cancer but not with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) (Zhang et al. 2004) or pancreatic cancer (McWilliams et al. 2008). A total of eighteen polymorphisms in APEI have been reported, among which Gln51His and Asp148Glu are the two most common SNPs. Associations between polymorphisms in APEI and increased risk of lung, colon, breast, SCCHN, prostate, and pancreatic cancer have been reported, but with mixed results (Goode, Ulrich, and Potter 2002; Zhang et al. 2004; Hung et al. 2005; Jiao et al. 2006).
