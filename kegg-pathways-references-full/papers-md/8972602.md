Sinapoylmalate is one of the major phenylpropanoid metabolites that is accumulated in the vegetative tissue of *Arabidopsis thaliana*. A thin-layer chromatography-based mutant screen identified two allelic mutant lines that accumulated sinapoylglucose in their leaves in place of sinapoylmalate. Both mutations were found to be recessive and segregated as single Mendelian genes. These mutants define a new locus called *SNG1* for sinapoylglucose accumulator. Plants that are homozygous for the *sng1* mutation accumulate normal levels of malate in their leaves but lack detectable levels of the final enzyme in sinapate ester biosynthesis, sinapoylglucose:malate sinapoyltransferase. A study of wild-type and *sng1* seedlings found that sinapic acid ester biosynthesis in *Arabidopsis* is developmentally regulated and that the accumulation of sinapate esters is delayed in *sng1* mutant seedlings.

The general phenylpropanoid pathway gives rise to a wide array of soluble metabolites in plants. In *Arabidopsis* these compounds include flavonoids and sinapic acid esters (Chapple et al., 1994). Flavonoid-deficient mutants have been identified based on the altered seed color of plants that are unable to make the flavonoid pigments that are found in the wild-type seed coat. Eleven of these *tt* (*transparent testa*) loci are known in *Arabidopsis*, and some of the genes that correspond to these loci have been cloned (Feinbaum and Ausubel, 1988; Shirley et al., 1992, 1995). In contrast, to date only one locus that affects sinapic acid ester biosynthesis has been identified. The *fah1* mutant is blocked at the step of the general phenylpropanoid pathway catalyzed by F5H (Chapple et al., 1992). Plants homozygous for the *fah1* mutation lack all sinapic acid esters. The identification of a T-DNA tagged allele of *fah1* has enabled the cloning of the gene encoding F5H, a Cyt P450-dependent monooxygenase (Meyer et al., 1996).

Sinapate esters play an important role in UV-B resistance in *Arabidopsis* (Landry et al., 1995); however, these metabolites are dispensable under laboratory conditions (Chapple et al., 1992). As a result, the sinapate ester biosynthetic pathway is an ideal candidate for genetic analysis. This

pathway has been examined in radish seedlings, in which sinapic acid is converted to sinapoylglucose by sinapic acid:UDPG sinapoyltransferase (Fig. 1; Strack, 1980). The product of this reaction is a 1-O-Glc ester that has a high free energy of hydrolysis (Mock and Strack, 1993), thus providing the necessary energy for the subsequent transacylation reaction. In this final reaction, sinapoylglucose acts as a sinapate donor in the reaction catalyzed by SMT (Strack, 1982), a vacuolar enzyme that generates sinapoylmalate (Sharma and Strack, 1985). The activity of these two enzymes establishes the sinapic acid ester profile seen in mature leaves. In developing seeds, sinapoylglucose is transesterified by sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase to form sinapoylcholine (Strack et al., 1983), which serves as a choline reserve in seeds. Following germination, hydrolysis of sinapoylcholine by sinapoylcholinesterase (Strack et al., 1980) provides choline for phospholipid biosynthesis (Strack, 1981) and sinapic acid for sinapoylmalate biosynthesis in the developing cotyledons (Strack, 1977). Despite the detailed biochemical understanding of this pathway, none of the genes involved has been cloned, and relatively little is known about how this pathway is regulated.

To examine phenylpropanoid metabolism in *Arabidopsis*, we have isolated *Arabidopsis* mutants that are defective in the synthesis of sinapoylmalate. Sinapate esters display a bright blue fluorescence under UV light, allowing the facile identification of these mutants by TLC of crude methanolic leaf extracts. In this paper we describe the characterization of a new *Arabidopsis* mutant that is named *sng1* for sinapoylglucose accumulator. Plants homozygous for the *sng1* mutation fail to accumulate sinapoylmalate but instead accumulate its precursor, sinapoylglucose.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

All experiments were performed using *Arabidopsis thaliana* L. Heynh. ecotype Columbia cultivated at a light intensity of 100 μmol m⁻² s⁻¹ at 23°C under a photoperiod of 16 h of light/8 h of dark. Homozygous *sng1-1* plants used in biochemical experiments had been backcrossed to wild type and reselected from segregating F₂ populations six times to remove unlinked background mutations. Segregation tests were performed using the Landsberg *erecta* ecotype.

Figure 1. Sinapate ester biosynthesis. The enzymatic steps required for the conversion of Phe to sinapic acid are Phe ammonia-lyase (PAL), cinnamate-4-hydroxylase (C4H), *p*-coumarate-3-hydroxylase (C3H), caffeic acid/5-hydroxyferulic acid O-methyltransferase (OMT), and F5H. The enzymes that are unique to sinapate ester biosynthesis are sinapic acid UDPG:sinapoyltransferase (SGT), SMT, sinapoylglucose:choline sinapoyltransferase (SCT), and sinapoylcholinesterase (SCE).

Plants for mutant screening and characterization were grown in soil-less potting mixture. For plant material to be used in the analysis of sinapate esters and SMT activity during early seedling development, seeds were surface-sterilized for 30 min in a 2:1 mixture of 0.1% Triton X-100 and household bleach. Seeds were rinsed thoroughly with sterile water and plated on Miracloth (Calbiochem) discs on modified MS medium (ammonia-free medium in which an additional 20.6 mM potassium nitrate was added in place of ammonium nitrate) (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) containing 1% Suc and 0.7% agar.

### Genetic Methods

For mutant screening, leaves of 7600 individual M₂ plants from ethyl methanesulfonate-mutagenized populations were extracted for 30 min in 50 μL of 50% methanol. Five microliters of the extract was analyzed by silica gel TLC using a mobile phase of *n*-butanol:ethanol:water (4:1:1, v/v). Putative mutants were retested by the same procedure in the next generation, and those that showed a heritable change in sinapate ester accumulation were back-crossed to wild type to remove unlinked background mutations. Homozygous *sng1* progeny were reselected from segregating populations by TLC analysis.

### Isolation and Identification of Sinapoylglucose

The isolation of the fluorescent compound that accumulated in the *sng1* mutant was accomplished by fractionation of extracts by reverse-phase chromatography, followed by crystallization of the putative sinapoylglucose. Briefly, 30 g of *sng1* leaf material was extracted for 20 min in 500 mL of 50% methanol. The extract was filtered through Miracloth and concentrated in vacuo to 10 mL. The residual aqueous phase was extracted twice with 5 mL of chloroform, and the aqueous phase was again reduced in vacuo to 2 mL. The aqueous residue was applied to two Fisher C₁₈ reverse-phase cartridges, which were then each eluted with 2 × 1 mL of water, and then 1 mL each of 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 50, and 100% methanol. Samples of each fraction were analyzed by silica gel TLC using *n*-butanol:ethanol:water (4:1:1, v/v) as a mobile phase. The putative sinapoylglucose eluted in the 10 to 20% methanol fractions, which were stored overnight at 4°C, during which time a white crystalline precipitate formed. These crystals were separated from the supernatant and recrystallized twice from methanol to give a final yield of 2.9 mg of colorless needles.

To identify the phenolic moiety of the crystallized compound, a sample of approximately 0.1 mg was subjected to base hydrolysis in 1 mL of 0.1 M NaOH at 37°C for 1 h. The mixture was then acidified with 3 mL of 1 M HCl and extracted with 4 mL of diethylether. The ether phase was dried and redissolved in methanol for analysis by silica gel TLC using a mobile phase of toluene:glacial acetic acid (2:1, v/v) saturated with water. The hydrolysis product was identified by comparison with authentic hydroxycinnamic acids (Sigma) visualized under UV light.

To determine whether the crystallized compound contained a sugar moiety, another 0.1-mg sample was hydrolyzed at 80°C for 3 h in 1 M H₂SO₄. The sample was then neutralized with 9 M NH₄OH, reduced (1 mL of 2% sodium borohydride in DMSO, for 90 min at 40°C), acetylated (4 mL of acetic anhydride plus 250 μL of 1-methylimidazole as a catalyst, for 10 min at room temperature), extracted into methylene chloride, and analyzed (Reiter et al., 1993) using a gas chromatograph (model 5890, Hewlett-Packard) equipped with a 30-m × 0.75-mm i.d. column (model SP-2330, Supelco, Bellefonte, PA) and flame ionization detection.

MS analysis of the crystallized compound was performed on the native compound or on its trimethylsilylated derivative following treatment with *N*,*O*-bis(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide at 80°C for 10 min. Plasma desorption MS, chemical ionization MS, and electron impact MS were performed at the Purdue University Campus-wide MS Center (West Lafayette, IN).

### Sinapic Acid Ester Analysis

Columbia wild-type or *sng1* plants that were grown in either potting medium or modified MS medium were harvested, weighed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at −70°C until use. Sinapic acid esters were extracted into 50% methanol at a tissue:solvent ratio of 100 mg mL⁻¹ by briefly grinding and refreezing the tissue at −70°C for 30 min in extraction solvent. Extracts were thawed and centrifuged briefly, and 20 μL of the supernatant was used for quantitation with HPLC.

### HPLC

For HPLC analysis of plant extracts, sinapic acid esters and free phenolic acids were separated on a Microsorb-MV C₁₈ column (Rainin, Woburn, MA), using a gradient from

12% acetonitrile in 1.5% phosphoric acid to 48% acetonitrile in 1.5% phosphoric acid. Eluted compounds were detected by their UV $A_{320}$. Quantitation of sinapoylmalate in SMT enzyme assays was performed by HPLC on the same column using an isocratic mobile phase of 20% acetonitrile in 1.5% phosphoric acid. Compound identity was determined by co-chromatography with authentic sinapate esters isolated from Arabidopsis (Chapple et al., 1992) or with authentic phenolic acids.

### Enzyme Assays

Columbia wild-type or *sng1* tissue that was grown on modified MS medium was extracted for 30 min in 5 volumes of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) containing 20% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone. The extracts were centrifuged for 5 min at 10,000g and the supernatant was used for determination of SMT activity. Each assay contained 25 μL of 2 mM sinapoylglucose, 15 μL of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), 5 μL of 1 M malic acid in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0), and 5 μL of the protein extract. Assays were incubated for 60 min at 30°C, stopped by the addition of 50 μL of methanol, and stored at −70°C until analyzed by HPLC. Protein content was determined according to the method of Bradford (1976) using bovine γ-globulin as a standard.

### Malic Acid Determination

For the determination of malic acid content, tissue was extracted for 30 min in distilled water (100 mg tissue mL⁻¹) in a boiling water bath. The samples were ground, re-extracted for a further 10 min, and centrifuged. Fifty microliters of the supernatant was transferred to a microfuge tube containing 730 μL of 100 mM 1-amino-isopropanol buffer (pH 10.0), 100 μL of 30 mM β-NAD, 100 μL of 0.5 M L-Glu, and 4 units of glutamate:oxaloacetate aminotransferase. Reactions were initiated by the addition of 30 units of malate dehydrogenase. The increase of absorption was measured spectrophotometrically at 365 nm, and the rates obtained were compared with a standard curve generated using known concentrations of malic acid (Moellering, 1974). All enzymes were purchased from Sigma or Boehringer Mannheim.

### RESULTS

#### Isolation of the *sng1* Mutant

A mutant screen of 7600 plants by TLC analysis of methanolic leaf extracts identified two mutants that lacked sinapoylmalate but accumulated a novel blue-fluorescent compound with a higher $R_F$ value in partition chromatography (Fig. 2A). In crosses to wild type, the mutant phenotypes segregated as single, recessive nuclear mutations (Table I). These two lines failed to complement one another, indicating that they are alleles of a novel locus that we have named the *SNG1* (sinapoylglucose accumulator). Quantitative HPLC analysis of wild-type and *sng1-1* leaf extracts confirmed that *sng1-1* plants completely lacked sinapoylmalate but contained an equivalent amount of a

UV-absorbent compound with a shorter retention time (Fig. 2B). Both the TLC $R_F$ value and the HPLC retention time of the unknown compound that accumulated in the *sng1* mutants indicated that the compound was sinapoylglucose.

### Identification of the Compound Accumulated in the *sng1* Mutant

The unidentified fluorescent compound that accumulated in the *sng1-1* mutant was purified by reverse-phase column chromatography, followed by crystallization from methanol. Analysis of the purified compound gave an $R_F$ value on TLC and a retention time on HPLC that were identical to those of an authentic sample of sinapoylglucose that was isolated from seeds of *Raphanus sativus*. Base hydrolysis of the compound, followed by TLC analysis of the hydrolysis products, yielded a single blue-fluorescent spot that co-chromatographed with authentic sinapic acid, indicating that the unknown compound was an ester of sinapic acid. Acid hydrolysis, followed by reduction and acetylation of the products, indicated the presence of Glc in stoichiometric amounts relative to the mass of the unknown compound that was hydrolyzed. Plasma desorption MS of the unknown compound gave a prominent $(M+H)^+$ parental ion at an m/z ratio of 387, the expected mass for sinapoylglucose.

mide gave prominent peaks at 746 and 747, corresponding to the expected M⁺ and (M+H)⁺ for the trimethylsilylated derivative of sinapoylglucose (Linscheid et al., 1980). Major ions were identified with m/z values of 674 and 602, corresponding to the loss of one or two trimethylsilyl groups from the parent compound. Electron impact MS of the trimethylsilylated compound gave major ions at 674, 368, 296, and 279 as expected, based on the characterization of sinapoylglucose from *R. sativus* (Linscheid et al., 1980). Taken together, these data clearly indicate that the *sng1* mutants accumulate sinapoylglucose.

### Comparison of Wild-Type and *sng1* Mutant Biochemical Profiles

An initial characterization of the *sng1* mutant was made using plants that were the same age as those used in the mutant screen. As shown in Table II, 3-week-old wild-type plants contain sinapoylmalate as their major hydroxycinnamic acid ester and a small pool of its precursor, sinapoylglucose. In contrast, the *sng1* mutant fails to accumulate sinapoylmalate, and accumulates an equivalent amount of sinapoylglucose in its place. When the malate pools of both genotypes were examined, no significant difference was found, suggesting that the lack of sinapoylmalate in the *sng1* mutant was not due to the absence of one of the substrates for the reaction catalyzed by SMT. Finally, SMT activity was measured directly in crude extracts of wild-type and *sng1* mutant leaf tissue. Whereas SMT activity was readily detectable in wild-type leaf extracts, it was undetectable in extracts of mutant leaf tissue. These data suggest that the defect in the *sng1* mutant is in the gene encoding SMT or in a gene the product of which is required for SMT expression.

The dry seeds of both wild type and the *sng1* mutant contain approximately 250 pmol of sinapoylcholine and 50 pmol of sinapoylglucose, indicating that the *sng1* mutation does not affect the accumulation of sinapate esters in seeds (Fig. 3A). In wild-type seeds, sinapoylcholine levels declined during the first 3 d after germination as the compound was hydrolyzed, presumably by an enzyme that is similar to the sinapoylcholinesterase previously described in radish (Strack et al., 1980). Two to 3 d after imbibition there was a transient increase in sinapoylglucose levels. This increase was followed by a decline in the sinapoylglucose content on d 4 through 8 and a dramatic increase in sinapoylmalate. The increase in sinapoylmalate was correlated with an increase in both seedling malate content (Fig. 3B) and SMT activity (Fig. 3C). This pattern of interconversions is very similar to the changes seen in radish cotyledons during germination (Strack 1977, 1982). In addition to sinapate ester interconversions, de novo synthesis of sinapic acid apparently occurs between d 5 and 8, since the levels of sinapic acid esters in 8-d-old seedlings (approximately 1000 pmol seedling⁻¹) are significantly higher than those seen in dry seeds (300 pmol seed⁻¹).

In the *sng1* mutant, as in wild type, sinapoylcholine hydrolysis begins within 1 d of imbibition and is complete between d 3 and 4 (Fig. 3). The decline in the sinapoylcholine content is matched by an increase in the sinapoylglucose pool, but transesterification of sinapoylglucose to form sinapoylmalate does not occur in the mutant. The failure of the mutant to accumulate sinapoylmalate does not appear to be due to an alteration in malate availability, since the *sng1* mutant seedlings show a time course of malate accumulation that is identical to that seen in wild type.

In contrast to wild type, the sinapoylglucose accumulated by the *sng1* seedlings remains at a near-constant level between d 2 and 6 and begins to increase toward the levels seen in mature plants (Table II) only after d 7. It is interesting that the altered kinetics of sinapate ester accumulation in the *sng1* mutant can be visualized in vivo under UV light. Like *fah1* mutants (Chapple et al., 1992), *sng1* mutant seedlings exhibit a red-fluorescent phenotype that is due to the suppression of sinapate ester accumulation in young seedlings. In contrast to *fah1* seedlings, this phenotype disappears in more mature plants once the level of sinapoylglucose increases.

### Developmentally Regulated Sinapate Ester Interconversion

Radish seedlings exhibit a developmentally regulated interconversion of sinapic acid ester pools (Strack, 1977). To evaluate whether the same interconversions occur in Arabidopsis and to determine how the *sng1* mutation impacts on phenylpropanoid metabolism during early seedling development, the levels of sinapic acid esters (Fig. 3A), free malic acid (Fig. 3B), and SMT activity (Fig. 3C) in wild-type and *sng1* Arabidopsis were measured during the first 8 d of seedling development. These experiments were conducted on seedlings grown on modified MS medium that contained nitrate as its sole nitrogen source because ammonia has previously been shown to inhibit sinapoylmalate accumulation and decrease SMT activity in radish seedlings (Dahlbender and Strack, 1984; Strack et al., 1986).

### DISCUSSION

Compared with the number of studies that have focused on the biosynthesis, molecular biology, and function of flavonoids in Arabidopsis (Feinbaum and Ausubel, 1988;

Sinapic Acid Ester Metabolism in Arabidopsis

Symbols and error bars represent mean values ± SE.

Shirley et al., 1992, 1995; Li et al., 1993; Lois, 1994; Lois and Buchanan, 1994), the biosynthesis of sinapic acid esters has received a minimal amount of attention (Chapple et al., 1992; Mock et al., 1992). The identification and characterization of the sinapic acid ester-deficient *fah1* mutant demonstrated the importance of sinapoylmalate in UV-B resistance (Landry et al., 1995) and led to the cloning of the gene encoding F5H (Meyer et al., 1996). Additional Arabidopsis mutants that are affected in sinapate ester biosynthesis will help to further elucidate the biosynthesis, regulation, and roles of these compounds. The *sng1* mutant identifies the second locus that is required for the accumulation of the wild-type profile of sinapic acid esters in Arabidopsis.

The nature of the defect in the *sng1* mutant can be inferred from several pieces of evidence. First, the mutant accumulates sinapoylglucose, the substrate for the reaction catalyzed by SMT, in place of the SMT reaction product sinapoylmalate. Second, malic acid is accumulated to normal levels in the mutant, suggesting that the second substrate for the SMT reaction does not limit the progress of this reaction. Third, SMT activity is below detectable levels in the *sng1* mutant. These data indicate that the *sng1* locus encodes SMT or a regulatory protein that is required for SMT expression.

Although it is likely that the *sng1* mutation affects the structural gene encoding SMT, it has previously been reported that growth of radish seedlings on ammonia-containing medium resulted in a drastic inhibition of leaf malate accumulation and a decrease in extractable SMT activity (Dahlbender and Strack, 1984; Strack et al., 1986). These data support the possibility that the defect in the *sng1* mutant is in a malate- or ammonia-responsive SMT regulatory gene. Growth of Arabidopsis seedlings on ammonia-containing medium resulted in a 20-fold reduction in malate content, a 50% reduction in SMT activity, and a reduction in sinapoylmalate content (M. Lorenzen and C. Chapple, unpublished results). The magnitude of these responses, however, is inconsistent with the phenotype of the *sng1* mutant, and it is more likely that the defect lies within the structural gene for SMT. It is interesting to note that protein extracts from *R. sativus* contain four SMT isoforms; the two major forms have pIs of 5.75 and 5.90. Extracts of Arabidopsis contain only one SMT with a pI of 5.15 (M. Lorenzen and D. Strack, unpublished results). The presence of a single SMT would be consistent with the hypothesis that SMT activity is eliminated in the *sng1* mutant of Arabidopsis by mutation of a single gene.

Germinating Arabidopsis seedlings exhibit a series of sinapate ester interconversions that are similar to those previously described in radish and *Brassica rapa* (Strack, 1977; Mock et al., 1992). These interconversions require a complex set of overlapping control mechanisms regulating the genes encoding sinapoylcholinesterase, sinapic acid UDPG:sinapoyltransferase, and SMT during the first 8 d of germination. Sinapate ester biosynthetic genes may also be regulated in concert with those encoding enzymes of the general phenylpropanoid pathway. The coordinate regulation of these genes may control the onset of de novo synthesis of sinapate esters approximately 6 d after germination (Fig. 3A), and a perturbation of this regulation may explain the slowed accumulation of sinapate esters in the *sng1* mutant. A more detailed understanding of this regulation will clearly require the cloning of the structural and regulatory genes that act in this pathway. The availability of the *sng1* mutant will permit the cloning of one of these genes, potentially that encoding SMT. SMT has previously been shown to be a vacuolar enzyme (Sharma and Strack, 1985). In concert with the *sng1* mutant, the cloning of the SMT gene will provide useful tools for investigating vacuolar protein targeting.
