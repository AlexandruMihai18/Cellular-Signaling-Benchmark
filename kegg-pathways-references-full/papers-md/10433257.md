## Introduction

Of the many slow-acting neurotransmitters utilized by the mammalian central nervous system, dopamine has received by far the most attention. There are major medical reasons for this interest in understanding the nature of dopaminergic neurotransmission. Parkinson’s disease is attributable to a selective degeneration of midbrain nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons. Huntington’s chorea is caused by a deterioration of dopaminoceptive projection neurons in the neostriatum. Virtually all antischizophrenic drugs in current use act as antagonists at a major subclass of dopamine receptors, supporting the conjecture that aberrations in dopaminergic neurotransmission contribute to the symptomatology of schizophrenia. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms are greatly alleviated by drugs that regulate dopaminergic transmission. Finally, drugs of abuse of the cocaine, amphetamine, and opiate classes, as well as nicotine and alcohol, achieve some of their addictive actions by modifying dopaminergic transmission.

Despite the widespread interest in, and clinical importance of, dopaminergic signaling, little was known until recently concerning the molecular and cellular basis for the actions of dopamine on its target cells. In this article, we review recent studies that demonstrate that a phosphoprotein, known by the acronym DARPP-32 (dopamine and cyclic adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate-regulated phosphoprotein, 32 kDa), plays a central role in the biology of dopaminoceptive neurons. Dopamine and numerous other neurotransmitters that have been found in the neostriatum and shown to have physiological effects on dopaminoceptive neurons alter the phosphorylation and/or dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Figure 1). In its phosphorylated but not dephosphorylated form, DARPP-32 is an extremely potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase-1 (PP-1), a major multifunctional serine/threonine protein phosphatase in the brain. PP-1, in turn, regulates the phosphorylation state and activity of many downstream physiological effectors, including various neurotransmitter receptors and voltage-gated ion channels. Studies of mice lacking the DARPP-32 gene have provided convincing evidence that this protein plays an essential role in mediating the actions and interactions of dopamine and other neurotransmitters that act on dopaminoceptive neurons (Figure 1 and Table 1). These studies have also shown that the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade is a major target for psychostimulants and antischizophrenic drugs.

### Dopamine and the Neostriatum

A major target for midbrain dopaminergic neurons is the neostriatum (Figure 2). Compared to other brain regions, the neostriatum is remarkably homogeneous. About 95% of all neostriatal neurons have a similar morphology and are referred to as medium-sized spiny neurons. They are the only known projection neurons in the neostriatum, and therefore function to integrate all input to this brain region. DARPP-32 is expressed in very high concentration (∼50 μM) in virtually all medium spiny neurons (Ouimet et al., 1984, 1998) (Figure 2). Medium spiny neurons contain both D1 class (D1, D5) and D2 class (D2, D3, D4) dopamine receptors (Sibley and Monsma, 1992). Analysis of dopamine action is complicated by the differential distribution of these receptors. While still controversial, the prevailing view is that D1 and D2 dopamine receptors are largely segregated in two subpopulations of medium spiny neurons (Gerfen et al., 1990; Hersch et al., 1995; Yung et al., 1995). The D1 class are expressed predominantly in striatonigral neurons (direct pathway) and are colocalized with the neuropeptides dynorphin and substance P. In contrast, the D2 class of receptors are found predominantly in striatopallidal neurons (indirect pathway) and are colocalized with enkephalin. However, based on physiological analysis of the actions of D1 and D2 agonists (see below), and analysis of mRNA expression, it appears likely that a significant subpopulation of medium spiny neurons express both D1 and D2 classes of receptors (Surmeier et al., 1996).

Medium spiny neurons contain both NMDA and non-NMDA classes of glutamate receptors and receive major excitatory inputs from glutamate-containing corticostriatal nerve terminals (reviewed by Gerfen, 1992; Smith et al., 1998). In addition to glutamate and dopamine, medium spiny neurons receive an inhibitory input from GABA-containing nerve terminals via recurrent collaterals (Gerfen, 1992; Smith et al., 1998). Adenosine A₂A receptors are expressed specifically on striatopallidal neurons (Svenningsson et al., 1997), where they are coexpressed with D2 receptors. Opiate receptors (Mansour et al., 1987), as well as receptors for neuropeptides such as cholecystokinin (CCK) and neurotensin (Fuxe et al., 1995; Ferraro et al., 1998), are also found in the striatum and have been shown to influence the activity of medium spiny neurons. The striatum also contains a small population of interneurons, including large aspiny neurons that release acetylcholine, and several types of medium aspiny neurons that contain somatostatin and neuropeptide Y (Figueredo-Cardenas et al., 1996).

Figure 1. Central Role of the DARPP-32/ PP-1 Pathway in Signal Transduction in Medium Spiny Neurons

The DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway integrates information from a variety of neurotransmitters and produces a coordinated response involving numerous downstream physiological effectors. Green arrows indicate activating steps and red arrows indicate inhibitory steps. DARPP-32 phosphorylation at Thr-34 by PKA is regulated by the actions of various neurotransmitters, principally dopamine acting at D1 receptors, but also adenosine acting at A₂A receptors and VIP acting at VIP receptors. PKG activated in response to NO also phosphorylates Thr-34 of DARPP-32. In medium spiny neurons that coexpress D1 and D2 classes of dopamine receptor, activation of D2 receptors acts to decrease cAMP levels. In medium spiny neurons that coexpress adenosine A₂A receptors and D2 receptors, activation of D2 receptors also acts to decrease cAMP levels (not shown). Opiates acting at either μ or δ receptors decrease cAMP levels in cells stimulated with D1 agonists or adenosine A₂A agonists, respectively. DARPP-32 phosphorylated at Thr-34 is dephosphorylated by PP-2B, a Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase. PP-2B activity is activated by a number of different neurotransmitter receptors, principally following Ca²⁺ influx mediated by glutamate acting at NMDA receptors. Glutamate acting at AMPA receptors also stimulates DARPP-32 dephosphorylation by PP-2B, by an indirect mechanism that involves depolarization of the neuron and influx of Ca²⁺. Activation of D2 receptors also leads to an increase in Ca²⁺ levels, via an unidentified mechanism, and increased activity of PP-2B. In contrast, GABA acting at GABAA receptors stimulates DARPP-32 phosphorylation by hyperpolarization of the neuron, decreased influx of Ca²⁺, and inactivation of PP-2B. Neurotensin acts to increase DARPP-32 phosphorylation by increasing the release of dopamine. CCK decreases DARPP-32 phosphorylation by increasing glutamatergic neurotransmission. The psychomotor stimulants cocaine and amphetamine increase DARPP-32 phosphorylation by increasing dopaminergic neurotransmission. All antipsychotic drugs achieve certain of their clinical effects via antagonism of the D2 class of dopamine receptors, an action leading to an increase in the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32. Phospho-DARPP-32, by inhibiting the activity of PP-1, acts in a synergistic manner with different protein kinases (primarily PKA and PKC; not shown) to increase the level of phosphorylation of various downstream effector proteins. The resulting increase in phosphorylation is associated with increased activity of NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors, L-, N-, and P-type Ca²⁺ channels, and CREB and with decreased activity of GABAA receptors, Na⁺ channels, and the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase.

cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Stoof and Ke-babian, 1981), and phosphorylate DARPP-32 at a single site, Thr-34 (Figure 1). Under basal conditions, the stoichiometry of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr-34 in neostriatal slice preparations is low, but this increases rapidly in the presence of a D1 agonist (Nishi et al., 1997). Adenosine, via A₂A receptors, also activates PKA and increases DARPP-32 phosphorylation (Svenningson et al., 1998). The effect of an A₂A receptor-specific agonist is similar in magnitude to that of a D1 receptor

Figure 2. DARPP-32 and Organization of the Neostriatum

Simplified depiction of neostriatal connectivity, superimposed on DARPP-32 immunostaining in a rat parasaggital section. The dark immunoperoxidase staining for DARPP-32 is due to the very high level of expression in dopaminoceptive neostriatal medium spiny neurons and their axonal projections. Medium spiny neurons receive their major excitatory input from glutamatergic cortical projections (and thalamus; not shown). Medium spiny GABAergic output is directed to substantia nigra via both direct and indirect pathways. Neurons of the direct striatonigral pathway preferentially express D1 dopamine receptors, while those of the indirect pathway project to globus pallidus and preferentially express D2 dopamine receptors. Activation of the trisynaptic (Nst/GP/STN/SNr) indirect pathway results in disinhibition of SNr GABAergic output neurons, in opposition to the inhibitory influence of input from the direct striatonigral pathway. GABAergic output from the SNr returns via a glutamatergic thalamic relay to cortex. Dopaminergic input into this synaptic network comes from neurons of the SNc that project to dorsal neostriatum. Dopaminergic neurons with cell bodies in the SNc and dendrites in the SNr receive axodendritic innervation from terminals of the striatonigral pathway. Dopaminergic input to ventral striatum from the ventral tegmentum is not depicted. Color scheme: green, glutamatergic neurons; red, GABAergic neurons; blue, dopaminergic neurons.

both PP-2A and the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase PP-2B (or calcineurin) (King et al., 1984). PP-2B is highly enriched in medium spiny neurons (Goto et al., 1986) and plays a prominent role in the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 in intact cells (Nishi et al., 1997). In addition, PP-2B acts synergistically with PP-2A to regulate the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Nishi et al., 1999). The ability of the cAMP/PKA pathway to increase DARPP-32 phosphorylation in medium spiny neurons is abolished by NMDA (Halpain et al., 1990). This effect of NMDA is reduced by cyclosporin A, a highly specific PP-2B inhibitor. Similar results have been obtained following stimulation of the AMPA class of glutamate receptors (Snyder et al., 1995, Soc. Neurosci., abstract). Thus, NMDA and AMPA receptors, which are present on all medium spiny neurons, participate in glutamate-mediated dephosphorylation of DARPP-32, probably through Ca²⁺-dependent activation of PP-2B.

Activation of D2 receptors also decreases the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Nishi et al., 1997; Lindskog et al., 1998). Quinpirole, a D2 receptor agonist, decreases D1 agonist-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32, an effect that is blocked by inhibition of PP-2B. This action of quinpirole may occur in a subpopulation of medium spiny neurons of the striatonigral projection, which contain both D1 and D2 receptors (Surmeier et al., 1996; Nishi et al., 1997). Alternatively, the D2 receptor-mediated effect on D1 receptor activation may occur via interactions between striatopallidal and striatonigral neurons (Gerfen et al., 1990; Harsing and Zigmond, 1997; Le Moine et al., 1997; Lindskog et al., 1998).

Quinpirole also strongly inhibits the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 induced by an adenosine A₂A receptor agonist (Lindskog et al., 1998), by a mechanism that does not appear to involve PP-2B. This effect is likely to take place in the striatopallidal neurons in which these two receptors are coexpressed, via a Gᵢ-mediated mechanism (Stoof and Kebabian, 1981; Huff et al., 1998). Importantly, the regulation of DARPP-32 phosphorylation may be responsible for mediating the antagonistic relationship of dopamine and adenosine in this subpopulation of medium spiny neurons (Ferre et al., 1997).

In addition to glutamate and dopamine, several other neurotransmitters and neurohormones regulate DARPP-32 dephosphorylation in medium spiny neurons (Figure 1). In striatal slices, GABA induces a rapid, transient increase in DARPP-32 phosphorylation that is abolished by blockade of GABAₐ, but not GABAₐ, receptors (Snyder et al., 1994). This increase in DARPP-32 phosphorylation is likely to be caused by a decrease in the activity of PP-2B. CCK, which is abundant in corticostriatal nerve terminals in neostriatum, also regulates the state of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Snyder et al., 1993). CCK, through activation of CCKₐ receptors, decreases forskolin-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32, an effect that is blocked by an NMDA receptor antagonist. These and other data suggest that CCK stimulates the release of excitatory amino acids from glutamate-containing corticostriatal nerve terminals and/or aspartate-containing interneurons, which in turn stimulate glutamate receptors on medium spiny neurons (Snyder et al., 1993).

Regulation of DARPP-32 Dephosphorylation

Dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 plays an equally important role in the modulation of the DARPP-32/PP-1 signaling cascade (Figure 1). In vitro, DARPP-32 phosphorylated at Thr-34 is efficiently dephosphorylated by

Interaction of PP-1 with Targeting Subunits

**Localization of PP-1 to Dendritic Spines**

In addition to its regulation by DARPP-32, PP-1 also interacts with a distinct group of proteins, termed targeting subunits, that serve to localize the catalytic subunit of PP-1 to specific subcellular compartments and also to modulate PP-1 activity toward protein substrates at the targeted sites (Hubbard and Cohen, 1993; Faux and Scott, 1996). Biochemical studies have shown that PP-1, though present in all subcellular fractions, is particularly abundant in the postsynaptic density fraction (Shields et al., 1985; Sim et al., 1994). Consistent with this, immunoelectron microscopy reveals a high degree of enrichment of PP-1 in dendritic spines (Ouimet et al., 1995), postsynaptic specializations that receive the majority of excitatory input in the brain (Gray, 1959). A yeast two-hybrid screen led to the isolation of a previously unidentified neuronal PP-1 targeting protein that is also highly enriched in dendritic spines. This protein, named spinophilin, colocalizes with PP-1 and accounts for at least a part of the enrichment of PP-1 in spines (Figure 3) (Allen et al., 1997).

A further contribution to PP-1 synaptic targeting is likely to come from a second PP-1 binding protein that is related in structure to spinophilin (Nakanishi et al., 1997). This protein was identified based on its ability to bind to F-actin and was named neurabin (neuronal actin binding protein). Subsequently, spinophilin was also shown to bind to F-actin (and based on its similarity to neurabin was referred to as neurabin-II/spinophilin) (Satoh et al., 1998). Both spinophilin and neurabin possess consensus sites for phosphorylation within the actin binding region, raising the possibility that the interaction with actin is modulated following synaptic stimulation. PP-1 has been implicated in the control of the actin-myosin cytoskeleton in nonneuronal cells (Fernandez et al., 1990; Kaibuchi, 1999). Therefore spinophilin, PP-1, and possibly neurabin are well situated to regulate the dense actin filament network found in dendritic spines, and may control spine morphology and dynamics and thus synaptic efficacy (Harris and Kater, 1994).

**PP-1 Targeting by PDZ Domain–Containing Proteins**

Spinophilin and neurabin-I have the potential to interact with additional synaptic proteins (Figure 3). Both contain COOH-terminal stretches of predicted coiled-coil tertiary structure that may mediate self-association and/

Figure 4. Interaction of PP-1 with DARPP-32 and Targeting Proteins

(A) Schematic diagram showing the interaction of the inhibitory and docking domains of DARPP-32 with PP-1. The inhibition of PP-1 by phospho-DARPP-32 occurs via a two-site interaction involving the binding of phospho-Thr-34 to the active site of the enzyme (active site interaction) and the interaction of residues 7–11 of DARPP-32 with a region of PP-1 removed from the active site (docking site interaction).

(B) A conserved docking motif is involved in the binding of DARPP-32 and targeting proteins to PP-1. The docking motif, highlighted in blue, contains a BBHXH motif (where B indicates a basic amino acid, H indicates a hydrophobic amino acid, and X indicates a variable amino acid). Ser-461 adjacent to the docking motif of neurabin (McAvoy et al., 1999) and Ser-67 within the docking motif of the glycogen binding subunit of PP-1 (G_M) (Hubbard and Cohen, 1993) are phosphorylated by PKA resulting in inhibition of binding to PP-1.

or heterologous interactions. In addition, both proteins contain single PDZ domains, structures that have attracted much attention due to their role in coupling to transmembrane proteins. For example, the PSD-95 family of PDZ domain-containing proteins have been shown to bind to NMDA receptors and to Shaker-type K⁺ channels, promoting clustering of these receptors (Sheng and Wyszynski, 1997; Craven and Bredt, 1998; O’Brien et al., 1998). By analogy, spinophilin and neurabin, via their PDZ domains, may bind directly to neurotransmitter receptors or ion channels present at the synapse and thus bring PP-1 into the vicinity of relevant substrates. However, recent studies have shown that p70 ribosomal S6 kinase binds to the PDZ domain of neurabin (Burnett et al., 1998) and spinophilin (P. B. A. and P. E. Burnett, unpublished data). To date, no role in the regulation of synaptic transmission has been ascribed to p70 ribosomal S6 kinase. An intriguing possibility is that this complex may be involved in the regulation of local protein synthesis in the dendritic spine, a phenomenon that is thought to be responsive to changes in synaptic activity and may underlie certain forms of plasticity (Steward, 1997; Tiedge et al., 1999).

Structural Basis for the Interaction of PP-1 with DARPP-32 and Targeting Subunits

Phosphorylation of Thr-34 in DARPP-32 by PKA converts the protein into a potent inhibitor of PP-1 with an IC₅₀ of ~10⁻⁹ M (Hemmings et al., 1984a). A variety of structure-function studies have indicated that two domains of DARPP-32 are involved in the inhibition of PP-1 (Figure 4A) (Hemmings et al., 1990; Desdouits et al., 1995a; Kwon et al., 1997; Huang et al., 1999). An inhibitory domain, consisting of phospho-Thr-34 and the surrounding residues, is likely to occupy, or bind close to, the active site of the enzyme in a manner in which access to phosphorylated substrate is prevented. A second domain of DARPP-32, consisting of residues 7–11 (KKIQF), interacts with PP-1 at a site removed from the active site but is critical for inhibition (Figure 4A).

Studies of a number of PP-1 targeting subunits, including spinophilin and neurabin (Egloff et al., 1997; Hsieh-Wilson et al., 1999; McAvoy et al., 1999), have revealed that they contain a common structural motif related to the KKIQF sequence that is critical for binding to PP-1. This “docking motif” consists of one or more basic amino acids, followed by two hydrophobic residues that are separated by a variable amino acid (Figure 4B). The presence of a conserved docking motif in DARPP-32 and many PP-1 targeting subunits predicts that there will be mutually exclusive binding of the inhibitor and the targeting proteins to the catalytic subunit of PP-1. This has significant functional implications for AMPA receptor regulation (see Figure 7).

The identification of the docking motif has allowed the development of peptides that can antagonize the interaction of phospho-DARPP-32 or targeting subunits with PP-1 (Egloff et al., 1997; Kwon et al., 1997; Hsieh-Wilson et al., 1999) (see below). This provides an approach to the development of novel nonpeptide molecules that could interact with the docking site without inhibiting PP-1 activity. The three-dimensional structure of the catalytic subunit of PP-1 has been determined (Egloff et al., 1995; Goldberg et al., 1995), and the molecular basis for the interaction of the docking motif of the glycogen binding subunit with PP-1 has been elucidated (Egloff et al., 1997). The determination of additional details of the interactions of PP-1 with phospho-DARPP-32, and with neuronal PP-1 targeting proteins, may prove useful in the development of novel compounds for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and other disorders of dopamine signaling pathways.

Regulation of a Protein Phosphatase Cascade by Multisite Phosphorylation of DARPP-32

A number of studies now indicate that, in addition to phosphorylation of Thr-34 by PKA, DARPP-32 is phosphorylated on serine residues, and that serine phosphorylation modulates inhibition of PP-1. In intact neurons, DARPP-32 is highly phosphorylated on Ser-102

(A) Phosphorylation sites in DARPP-32. DARPP-32 is phosphorylated at Thr-34 by PKA (and PKG; not shown), at Ser-102 by CK2, and at Ser-137 by CK1. Phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by CK2 increases the rate of phosphorylation of Thr-34 by PKA (green arrow indicates positive effect); phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by CK1 decreases the rate of dephosphorylation of Thr-34 by PP-2B (red arrow indicates negative effect). Phospho-Ser-137 is preferentially dephosphorylated by PP-2C. NH₂-terminal domains of DARPP-32 that bind to PP-1 are shown in color.

and Ser-137. Ser-102 is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK2 (casein kinase II) and Ser-137 is phosphorylated by protein kinase CK1 (casein kinase I) (Figure 5A). Phosphorylation of Ser-102 of DARPP-32 by CK2 increases the efficiency of phosphorylation of Thr-34 by PKA but not PKG (Girault et al., 1989). In vitro, phosphorylation of Ser-137 by CK1 decreases the rate of dephosphorylation of Thr-34 by PP-2B, and in striatal slices DARPP-32 phosphorylated at Ser-137 is phosphorylated to a higher level at Thr-34 (Desdouits et al., 1995b, 1995c). The overall consequence of phosphorylation of DARPP-32 by CK1 or CK2 in intact cells is to increase the state of phosphorylation of Thr-34. The physiological effect of these two phosphorylation events is therefore to potentiate signaling through the dopamine/D1/cAMP/PKA/DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway and to reduce signaling through the glutamate/Ca²⁺/PP-2B/DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway.

Studies in vitro, and in intact cells, indicate that Ser-137 is preferentially dephosphorylated by PP-2C (Desdouits et al., 1998). The finding that Ser-137 phosphorylation influences the ability of PP-2B to act on Thr-34 reveals a hierarchical relationship among PP-2C, PP-2B, and PP-1 (Figure 5B). Thus, PP-2C activity toward Ser-137 increases the ability of PP-2B to dephosphorylate phospho-Thr-34. In turn, dephosphorylation of Thr-34 by PP-2B leads to the generation of active PP-1. Several protein kinase cascades have been described that are critical for signal amplification or for the integration of multiple inputs from distinct extracellular messengers (Blumer and Johnson, 1994). The hierarchical relationship described here is mechanistically distinct from those kinase cascades, since it requires DARPP-32. However, the physiological relationship between PP-2C, PP-2B, and PP-1 that is mediated by DARPP-32 results in a functionally analogous protein phosphatase cascade.

Role of the DARPP-32/PP-1 Cascade in Mediating the Physiological Actions of Dopamine

Electrophysiological studies have revealed a complex role for dopamine in the modulation of excitatory glutamatergic transmission in medium spiny neurons (re-

viewed by Kotter, 1994; Lovinger and Tyler, 1996; Cepeda and Levine, 1998; Nicola et al., 1999). Dopamine can either enhance (Cepeda et al., 1993) or inhibit (Calabresi et al., 1987; Cepeda et al., 1993; but see also Nicola and Malenka, 1998) glutamate-evoked excitation, effects that are dependent on both the subtype of dopamine receptor and the subtype of glutamate receptor involved. The effect of dopamine on the excitability of medium spiny neurons is also dependent on the membrane potential in the target neuron (Wilson, 1993; Wilson and Kawaguchi, 1996; Hernandez-Lopez et al., 1997). D1 and D2 receptor agonists have an inhibitory effect on neurons in a hyperpolarized “down state,” most likely mediated by effects on Ca²⁺, Na⁺, and K⁺ currents (reviewed by Cepeda and Levine, 1998). In contrast, D1 receptor agonists have an excitatory effect on neurons in a depolarized “up state,” which may be mediated by enhancement of L-type Ca²⁺ currents (Hernandez-Lopez et al., 1997; Cepeda et al., 1998). Therefore, the neuromodulatory role of dopamine on glutamate transmission is contingent on the complex regulation of multiple ionic conductances.

A variety of biochemical and electrophysiological studies have indicated that the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade plays a key role in mediating the effects of dopamine on ionic conductances in these cells (Figure 1). Moreover, strong support for this conclusion has been obtained by the characterization of mice with targeted deletion of the DARPP-32 gene (Table 1). Various physiological targets for the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade have been identified, including ligand-gated ion channels, voltage-gated ion channels, and the electrogenic ion pump Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase. A few examples will be discussed.

NMDA-Type Glutamate Receptors

Dopamine and D1 agonists increase the phosphorylation of the NR1 glutamate receptor subunit in medium spiny neurons via a cAMP/PKA-dependent pathway (Fienberg et al., 1998; Snyder et al., 1998). This effect of dopamine is significantly attenuated in neurons from DARPP-32 knockout mice. The phosphorylation of the NR1 subunit is likely to occur through a synergistic

![Figure 6. Synergistic Regulation of Physiological Effects by a Mechanism Involving Increased Phosphorylation and Decreased Dephosphorylation](#)

In the examples shown, NMDA glutamate receptors and L-type Ca²⁺ channels are regulated by PKA and the DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway. Dopamine, by activation of D1 receptors, increases cAMP levels leading to increased activity of PKA. PKA directly phosphorylates NMDA receptors (the NR1 subunit is a likely substrate) and L-type Ca²⁺ channels (green arrows indicate activation). PKA also phosphorylates DARPP-32 at Thr-34 leading to inhibition of PP-1 (red arrows indicate inhibition). PP-1 dephosphorylates either NMDA receptors or L-type Ca²⁺ channels, leading to their inactivation. Inhibition of PP-1 by phospho-DARPP-32 acts in a synergistic manner with PKA to increase the state of phosphorylation and activity of NMDA receptors and L-type Ca²⁺ channels. NMDA receptors and L-type Ca²⁺ channels are both voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels and act in an interdependent manner to increase intracellular Ca²⁺ levels.

mechanism that involves increased phosphorylation of Ser-897 in the channel by PKA (Tingley et al., 1997) and decreased dephosphorylation of the channel by a mechanism involving PKA-dependent phosphorylation of DARPP-32 and inhibition of PP-1 (Figure 6).

D1 receptor agonists, through activation of PKA, enhance currents evoked by NMDA in medium spiny neurons (Cepeda et al., 1998). Studies in oocytes have indicated that the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade is likely to be involved in mediating the effect of dopamine on NMDA receptor currents (Blank et al., 1997). NMDA receptor currents are potentiated by PKA activation in oocytes injected with mRNA from neostriatum but not from hippocampus. Downregulation of DARPP-32 using antisense oligonucleotides in oocytes injected with striatal mRNA negates the PKA-dependent enhancement of NMDA receptor currents. In contrast, coinjection of DARPP-32 mRNA with hippocampal mRNA confers regulation of NMDA receptor currents by PKA. The simplest interpretation of these studies is that increased NR1 phosphorylation mediated by activation of PKA and inhibition of PP-1 directly contributes to the increase in NMDA receptor currents. However, the precise role of NR1 phosphorylation in regulating the properties of the NMDA receptor has not been elucidated. Other studies in medium spiny neurons have indicated that inhibitors of L-type Ca²⁺ channels markedly reduce (but do not eliminate) the ability of dopamine to regulate NMDA receptor currents (Cepeda et al., 1998). D1 agonists enhance L-type Ca²⁺ currents in medium spiny neurons, an effect that is likely to be mediated by direct phosphorylation of the channel by PKA and inhibition of PP-1 by DARPP-32 (Sümerier et al., 1995). Thus, activation of the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade by dopamine will lead to parallel increases in the phosphorylation of both NMDA NR1 subunits and L-type Ca²⁺ channels and, in an interdependent manner, to an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels (Figure 6). The increase in Ca²⁺ levels will, in turn, presumably activate PP-2B and dephosphorylate DARPP-32 as part of a negative feedback mechanism.

AMPA-Type Glutamate Receptors

The activity of the AMPA receptor is known to be potentiated by phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit on multiple sites at the COOH terminus by enzymes that include PKA (Roche et al., 1996). This may account for the PKA-induced potentiation of the glutamate response originally observed in hippocampal neurons (Greengard et al., 1991; Wang et al., 1991). In acutely dissociated striatal neurons, when AMPA currents are recorded in the whole-cell mode, a time-dependent reduction in current amplitude is observed (Yan et al., 1999). This current “rundown” is prevented by the application of a dopamine D1 receptor agonist. Elucidation of the postreceptor mechanisms that underlie this effect implicate DARPP-32, spinophilin, and PP-1. Infusion of a phosphorylated, active form of DARPP-32 mimics the effect of the D1 agonist. In addition, the effect of the D1 agonist on AMPA receptor current is greatly reduced in striatal neurons from DARPP-32 knockout mice. Dopamine, via activation of PKA and inhibition of PP-1, synergistically increases phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor. Together, these results suggest that decreased dephosphorylation of the AMPA receptor results in increased channel activity (Figure 7).

Disruption of the spinophilin/PP-1 targeting complex also resulted in modulation of AMPA channel currents. These experiments were enabled by the mapping of the docking motif for PP-1 on spinophilin (Figure 4B). A peptide was identified that mimics the docking motif and that antagonizes the interaction of PP-1 with full-length spinophilin in vitro without affecting the activity of PP-1 (Hsieh-Wilson et al., 1999). When this peptide is infused into medium spiny neurons, the rundown in AMPA channel current is prevented. In this case, the effect is not attributable to PP-1 inhibition but rather to the disruption of PP-1 targeting, i.e., the removal of PP-1 from a close interaction with AMPA channels. This prevents channel dephosphorylation and the associated loss of activity (Figure 7). In the neostriatum, cortex, and

Figure 7. Regulation of AMPA-Type Glutamate Receptors by DARPP-32 and Spinophilin

Model illustrates how regulation of PP-1 could account for the ability of DARPP-32 and spinophilin to control AMPA channels.

(Top) Spinophilin, by binding to an unidentified intermediate protein (not shown), localizes PP-1 in the vicinity of the AMPA channel. Under basal conditions, the PP-1/spinophilin complex maintains the AMPA channel (or an associated protein) in a dephosphorylated, low-activity state.

(Bottom left) Following D1 receptor stimulation, AMPA channel phosphorylation is increased due both to direct PKA phosphorylation and to PKA/phospho-DARPP-32-mediated inhibition of PP-1. This synergistic increase in phosphorylation stimulates AMPA channel activity. The kinase anchoring protein (AKAP) believed to localize PKA in the vicinity of the AMPA receptor (Rosenmund et al., 1994) is not shown.

(Bottom right) Activity of the AMPA channel can be increased by disrupting the spinophilin/PP-1 interaction using a peptide encompassing the high-affinity PP-1 docking motif of spinophilin.

hippocampus, immunoelectron microscopy has indicated that both dopamine D1 and D2 receptors can be found in dendritic spines (Bergson et al., 1995; Yung et al., 1995). Thus, PP-1 targeting may be particularly relevant with regard to the dopaminergic modulation of the postsynaptic glutamate response.

**Regulation of Voltage-Gated Ion Channels**

D1 and D2 receptor agonists reduce the amplitude of Na⁺ current in most striatal medium spiny neurons (Surmeier and Kitai, 1993; Schiffmann et al., 1995). The inhibitory effect of D1 receptor stimulation is observed at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and reduces the responsiveness of medium spiny neurons to excitatory input. Inhibition of Na⁺ current requires PKA, and injection of phospho-DARPP-32, but not dephospho-DARPP-32, into striatal neurons mimics the effect of dopamine acting at D1 receptors (Schiffmann et al., 1995, 1998). Moreover, the effect of D1 receptor stimulation on Na⁺ current is significantly attenuated in medium spiny neurons from DARPP-32 knockout mice (Fienberg et al., 1998). In vitro and in intact cells, PKA directly phosphorylates Na⁺ channels, and this leads to inhibition of channel activity (Li et al., 1992). It appears likely that phospho-DARPP-32, by inhibiting PP-1, contributes to the D1 receptor-mediated inhibition of Na⁺ channels by reducing their dephosphorylation (Schiffmann et al., 1998).

Phosphorylation of N- and P-type Ca²⁺ channels is also associated with altered activity. In contrast to the effect on L-type Ca²⁺ channels described above, D1 receptor agonists reduce N- and P-type Ca²⁺ currents (Surmeier et al., 1995). The effect of D1 agonists is attenuated in medium spiny neurons obtained from DARPP-32 knockout mice (Fienberg et al., 1998), suggesting a role for the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade in the regulation of N- and P-type Ca²⁺ channels. Paradoxically, the inhibitory effect of D1 receptor activation is blocked either by PKA inhibitors or PP-1 inhibitors, including phospho-DARPP-32 (Surmeier et al., 1995). These results suggest a model in which PP-1 activity is increased by PKA, perhaps through regulation of a PP-1-targeting subunit, as a consequence of which the dephosphorylation of N- and P-type Ca²⁺ channels is increased.

**Regulation of Synaptic Plasticity**

At glutamatergic corticostriatal synapses, the induction of long-term depression (LTD) requires endogenous dopamine. Moreover, in striatal slices prepared from dopamine-depleted animals, LTD is restored by the simultaneous activation of D1 and D2 receptors (Calabresi et al., 1992). Dopamine also regulates long-term potentiation (LTP) in hippocampus (Frey et al., 1991; Huang and Kandel, 1995; Otmakhova and Lisman, 1996; Kusuki et al., 1997). In this brain region, PP-1 has been identified as a downstream effector in NMDA receptor-dependent induction of LTD (Mulkey et al., 1994). Conversely, inhibition of PP-1 is required to permit LTP induction in hippocampal neurons (Blitzer et al., 1995, 1998). Substrates for PP-1 that are likely to be involved in regulation of

synaptic plasticity include Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Silva et al., 1992; Lledo et al., 1995; Mayford et al., 1996; Rotenberg et al., 1996), the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor (Barria et al., 1997), and the cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) (Bourchuladze et al., 1994; Bito et al., 1996). Thus, PP-1 may influence the induction and maintenance of LTP and LTD via several different mechanisms. Studies using DARPP-32 knockout mice indicate that plasticity at corticostriatal synapses is under the control of DARPP-32 (P. Calabresi, personal communication). Spinophilin may also regulate synaptic plasticity, since it appears to control AMPA channels (see above), which carry much of the increase in current following LTP induction (Kauer et al., 1988; Muller and Lynch, 1988).

Role of the DARPP-32/PP-1 Cascade in Mediating the Actions of Psychoactive Drugs

The dopaminergic neurotransmitter system is a major target for the reinforcing properties of drugs of abuse, including cocaine, amphetamine, and opiates. In accordance with this, lesioning of the dopamine system, or the administration of dopamine receptor ligands and second messengers, interferes with the normal course of drug self-administration in animals (Self and Nestler, 1995). All three classes of these drugs, through distinct mechanisms, induce an increase in dopaminergic neurotransmission at the receptive fields of midbrain dopamine neurons (Koob et al., 1998) and regulate the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Figure 1). In intact animals, both cocaine and amphetamine increase DARPP-32 phosphorylation in neostriatum. In neostriatal slices, a μ opioid receptor agonist inhibits DARPP-32 phosphorylation induced by D1, but not by adenosine A₂A receptor stimulation. Conversely, a δ receptor agonist inhibits DARPP-32 phosphorylation induced by activation of A₂A, but not D1, receptors (Lindsog et al., 1999). These results are consistent with a selective expression of μ and δ opioid receptors in striatonigral and striatopallidal neurons, respectively.

Results from the analysis of DARPP-32 knockout mice have also indicated an essential role for the DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway in the behavioral actions of drugs of abuse (Table 1). Acute administration of cocaine or D-amphetamine normally leads to increases in locomotor activity. These responses are severely attenuated in DARPP-32-deficient animals. In contrast, the sensitization of the locomotor response to repeated cocaine administration is heightened in the DARPP-32 knockout animals (Fienberg et al., 1998; Hiroi et al., 1999). These results emphasize the distinct molecular mechanisms involved in the acute versus chronic effects of these drugs. In addition, they further indicate that DARPP-32 may subserve either a positive or a negative feedback role, depending on the particular system being examined.

Biochemical responses to drugs of abuse are also altered in DARPP-32 knockout mice. Neostriatal induction of the immediate-early response gene, c-fos, is normally seen following acute amphetamine administration, but this induction is attenuated in the DARPP-32 mutant animals. The effect may be due to reduced phosphorylation and activation of CREB in response to amphetamine, since CREB drives c-fos expression and is negatively regulated by PP-1 (Hagiwara et al., 1992; Bito et al., 1996). In addition to these changes in acute response, the long-term induction of c-fos isoforms, normally seen in response to chronic cocaine administration, was not observed in knockout animals. These deficits in the biochemical responses to psychostimulants may be related to a reduced propensity of DARPP-32 knockout mice to develop an addiction to these drugs. Thus, both place preference associated with cocaine administration and cocaine self-administration are attenuated in the DARPP-32 mutant mice (V. Zachariou and M. Picciotto, personal communication; L. Gold and G. Koob, personal communication).

An additional insight into the biological function of the DARPP-32/PP-1 pathway was obtained from the above drug treatment paradigms. The response deficits that are seen in the mutant mice at low drug doses are partially overcome at higher doses. These results suggest that supraphysiological activation of the dopamine signaling pathway can stimulate changes in the phosphorylation state and activity of physiological effectors that are sufficiently large to eliminate the need for positive feedback amplification from the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade.

Antidepressant Drugs

Antidepressant drugs (including lithium, imipramine, and tranylcypromine), when administered to rats, all induce a robust increase in DARPP-32 levels selectively in frontal cortex but not in other brain regions. This commonality of effect suggests that the upregulation of DARPP-32 expression may contribute to the clinical efficacy of these drugs (Guitart and Nestler, 1992).

Antischizophrenic Drugs

Although the dopamine system is implicated in the action of drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia, neither the underlying biochemical basis for the condition nor the mechanism whereby dopamine receptor antagonists provide clinical benefit is understood (Andreasen, 1996). Drugs used in the treatment of schizophrenia induce catalepsy when administered to rodents. This behavioral response is severely attenuated in the DARPP-32 knockout mice in response to the neuroleptic raclopride, a D2 receptor antagonist (Fienberg et al., 1998). At the molecular level, both haloperidol, a “typical antipsychotic,” and clozapine, an “atypical antipsychotic,” increase phosphorylation of DARPP-32 in rats. Raclopride blocks the D2-mediated opposition to D1-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (Nishi et al., 1997). Raclopride has a similar effect on the phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor subunit NR1 (Snyder et al., 1998). Together, these results suggest that the clinical effects of antipsychotic drugs may involve modulation of the state of phosphorylation and activity of the NMDA receptor, through a mechanism involving DARPP-32 (see Figure 6).

Concluding Remarks

The DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade plays an obligatory role in mediating actions of dopamine, be they excitatory or inhibitory, at both D1 and D2 classes of receptor. Various biochemical, physiological, and behavioral effects of dopamine, antipsychotic drugs, and drugs of abuse are greatly reduced or abolished in mice with a targeted deletion of the DARPP-32 gene. In addition to dopamine, numerous other neurotransmitters that regulate the excitability of dopaminergic neurons also utilize the

DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade to achieve their biological effects.

The DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade regulates the state of phosphorylation and activity of all of the physiological effectors in dopaminoceptive neurons examined to date. These include a variety of neurotransmitter receptors, voltage-gated ion channels, transcription factors, and an electrogenic ion pump. The convergence of a large number of signal transduction pathways on the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade and the resulting coordinated regulation of a variety of effectors provide a molecular framework for understanding the ability of medium spiny neurons to integrate the vast amount of information entering the neostriatum and to respond in a physiologically coherent fashion. Undoubtedly, other components of the DARPP-32/PP-1 signaling cascade will be found in dopaminoceptive neurons, including additional neurotransmitters as well as physiological effectors. Several PP-1 targeting proteins have been identified, one of which appears to be responsible for targeting PP-1 to dendritic spines. These targeting proteins contain consensus sequences for regulation by phosphorylation, providing still further potential sites for regulation. Elucidation of the numerous biochemical steps that either regulate or are regulated by the DARPP-32/PP-1 cascade provides novel candidates for the etiology of illnesses associated with abnormalities of dopaminergic neurotransmission, including schizophrenia, ADHD, Parkinson's disease, and drug addiction. Moreover, the results reveal novel targets for the development of drugs for the treatment of these various illnesses. Finally, clarification of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the regulation by dopamine of biological responses in target neurons, and of the interactions of dopamine with other neurotransmitters in these dopaminoceptive cells, provide a template for studying the actions, interactions, and pathophysiology of signal transduction pathways in other regions of the brain.
