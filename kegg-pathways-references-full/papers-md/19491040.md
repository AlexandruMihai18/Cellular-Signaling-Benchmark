ABSTRACT

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a multifunctional organelle which co-ordinates protein folding, lipid biosynthesis, calcium storage and release. Perturbations that disrupt ER homeostasis lead to the misfolding of proteins, ER stress and up-regulation of a signaling pathway called the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR is characterized by the induction of chaperones, degradation of misfolded proteins and attenuation of protein translation. Age-related declines and activity in key molecular chaperones and folding enzymes compromise proper protein folding and the adaptive response of the UPR. This review will highlight age-related changes in the protein folding machinery and in the UPR.

1. Introduction

The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a sub-cellular organelle comprised of a reticular membranous network that extends throughout the cytoplasm and that can be contiguous with the nuclear envelope. It is the site where all secretory and integral membrane proteins are folded and post-translationally modified in ATP dependent chaperone mediated processes. The ER is also a site of calcium storage, and steroid, cholesterol and lipid biosynthesis. Protein folding in the oxidizing environment of the ER is an energy-requiring process (Braakman et al., 1992; Dorner et al., 1990). Proteins are correctly folded and assembled in the ER prior to transit to the cell surface or to intracellular organelles. Hence the ER contains myriad chaperones, foldases, lectins and carbohydrate processing enzymes to assist proper protein folding. The environment within the ER is very complex and highly concentrated and differs substantially from that of the cytosol. Several co-translational and post-translational modifications that do not occur in the cytosol take place in the ER—these include disulfide bond formation, glycosylation and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor addition. It is estimated that the protein concentration within the ER lumen approaches 100 mg/ml, a concentration at which aggregation is promoted (Stevens and Argon, 1999). In addition there are large numbers of proteins folding concurrently, thereby exacerbating the likelihood of co-aggregation. The fact that protein aggregates do not accumulate is due in part to the existence of ER “quality control” machinery. ER quality control suppresses the formation of aggregates by ensuring fidelity of transcription and translation, by chaperoning nascent or unfolded proteins, and by selectively degrading improperly folded polypeptides before they can aggregate (Ellgaard and Helenius, 2003). Perturbations that alter ER homeostasis consequently disrupt protein folding and lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and protein aggregates that can be injurious to the cell. ER stress can be provoked by a variety of physiological conditions, including perturbations in calcium homeostasis, glucose/energy deprivation, redox changes, ischemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, viral infections and mutations that impair client protein folding (Kaufman, 2002; Ron, 2002). As a consequence, the cell has evolved an adaptive coordinated response to limit accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. This signaling pathway is termed the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response (UPR) [for more detailed reviews see (Harding et al., 2002; Schroder and Kaufman, 2005a; Zhang and Kaufman, 2006)]. This review will cover protein folding and quality control within the ER, the key components of the ER stress response, the alterations that occur with age and the consequences of unresolved ER stress. Several recent studies that examined the effect of age on the ER stress response system will also be reviewed.

2. Protein folding and quality control

The ER is a membrane bound compartment and the ER lumen is topologically equivalent to the extracellular space. It is a highly oxidizing environment that is suitable for protein folding and

Fig. 1. Schematic of the ER showing BiP and other key chaperones involved in protein folding. (a) Proteins destined for synthesis and folding in the ER are recognized through signal peptides by the signal recognition particle (SRP) which associates with the ribosome. (b) Passage of the growing peptide through the translocon is coupled with the ATPase activity of BiP. (c) BiP functions as a chaperone to fold substrates, as do the lectins calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT). Disulfide-bond formation is regulated by the activity of Ero1 through the protein disulfide isomerase. The bonds that are formed are modified by the activity of ERp57, which gains access to its folding substrate through its association with CXN or CRT. (d) Properly folded proteins exit the ER through coat protein (COP) II-coated vesicles, which are formed using energy from GTP and ATP. (e) Misfolded proteins can associate with BiP, CNX and PDI for retrotranslocation, ATP-dependent ubiquitylation and digestion by the proteasome, another ATP-dependent process.

maturation. In mammalian cells, ER bound proteins are directed there through hydrophobic signal sequences. The proteins are translocated into the ER co-translationally and folding occurs in three phases. First, co-translational and co-translocational folding takes place as the protein traverses the ER membrane through the Sec61p translocon complex (Fig. 1). Second, post-translational folding takes place after the completed polypeptide has been released from the ribosome and finally oligomeric assembly occurs. Chaperones and folding enzymes participate in all three stages of folding. Key chaperones and folding sensors in the ER (see Table 1) include the glucose regulated proteins 78 (GRP78; also known as Immunoglobulin Binding protein – BiP) and 94 (GRP94), the lectins, calnexin and calreticulin, and the thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases, protein disulfide isomerase (PDI) and ERp57. They reside in the ER in high concentration and participate in all stages of folding and in quality control. Several of these critical chaperones and foldases are decreased with age (see Table 1). Strict quality control within the ER prevents the release of incompletely assembled or improperly folded proteins to the cytosol or to downstream organelles and terminal compartments. Exposure of hydrophobic regions, unpaired cysteines and the tendency to aggregate are some of the features of nascent proteins that are recognized by the chaperones and folding sensors that result in retention within the ER.

### 2.1. Key molecular chaperones

#### 2.1.1. BiP/GRP78
BiP/GRP78 is one of the molecular chaperones first encountered by most newly synthesized polypeptides. BiP, a member of the hsp70 family (Gething and Sambrook, 1992; Haas, 1991) is also known as GRP78 and under the most recent nomenclature is referred to as Hsp5A. In mammalian cells BiP is present at the translocon where it serves to maintain the permeability barrier of the ER during the early stages of targeting nascent chains into the

### 2.1.2. Changes in BiP with age

As described above BiP levels are critical for proper folding and protein quality control. Several studies indicate that BiP expression declines with age. There is a 50% reduction in BiP protein expression in aged (24 months) mouse livers compared with that in young (3 months) tissue (Rabek et al., 2003). BiP protein levels are also decreased in brain tissue with age; there is a 30% decrease in BiP in the cerebral cortex of aged (22–24-month old) C57/B6 mice compared with that in young 3-month old mice (Naidoo et al., 2008). Both BiP mRNA and protein expression are reduced in the hippocampus of aged (23–26-month old) Wistar rats compared to that in 4–6-month old rats (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006). A study of various aged Wistar rats, suckling (0–4 days old), young (1-month old), adult (6-month old), and aged (>18-month old) examined BiP protein expression in the cortex, cerebellum, lung, liver, kidney, heart and spleen of these animals and found that BiP levels were higher in the young tissue than in the aged tissue (Hussain and Ramaiah, 2007). An examination of ER chaperone expression at regular intervals in the liver of rats aged 21 days until death indicates that BiP declined about 40% in the oldest animals (Erickson et al., 2006). BiP protein concentration in the hepatic microsomal preparation dropped from a peak of 80 μg/mg protein at 84 days to 48.5 μg/mg at 874 days of age. There was some seasonal variation in chaperone expression with peaks occurring during midwinter and midsummer. The seasonal cyclic changes also decreased with age. In addition to the declines in basal expression of BiP, the ATPase activity of BiP also declines with age. There is a 20% decrease in BiP ATPase activity, as measured by [γ32P] phosphate release, in aged (20–24-month old) C57/BL6 mice livers when compared to that in young 3-month old mice (Nuss et al., 2008). The age-related decrements in BiP both at the transcript and protein levels certainly impact the efficiency of protein folding and ER homeostasis.

### 2.1.3. GRP94

GRP94, the ER resident member of the hsp90 family is among the most abundant ER proteins accounting for 5–10% of the ER content (Argon and Simen, 1999). This molecular chaperone is also known as endoplasmin, CaBP4, ERp99 and gp96. It is found in vertebrates, in a few invertebrates including *C. elegans*, and in plants. GRP94 is a high capacity calcium binding protein with about 15 calcium binding sites and is thought to function as a calcium carrier (Argon and Simen, 1999). Unlike BiP, GRP94 does not associate with nascent polypeptides or early folding intermediates; it appears to associate with more advanced folding intermediates or with incompletely assembled proteins (Argon and Simen, 1999). It binds substrates after they have been released from BiP (Melnick et al., 1994). GRP94 binds to and chaperones a limited number of proteins that include immunoglobulin heavy chains, toll-like receptors and integrins (Hebert and Molinari, 2007; Melnick et al., 1994).

### 2.2. Glycosylation and quality control by calnexin and calreticulin

Calnexin and calreticulin are lectin proteins responsible for glycoprotein quality control. Calnexin is a transmembrane protein and calreticulin is the soluble luminal homolog. Both proteins interact with monoglycosylated, trimmed intermediates of N-linked core glycans on nascent glycoproteins. Calnexin binds to glycans found in membrane proximal domains while the soluble calreticulin associates with glycans within the ER lumen (Hebert and Molinari, 2007).

N-linked oligosaccharides are synthesized in the ER beginning with a multistep formation of a lipid-linked precursor consisting of dolichol pyrophosphate bound to a common 14 residue core oligosaccharide. N-linked glycosylation is initiated by transfer of the core oligosaccharide from the dolichol phosphate anchor that is membrane bound to consensus asparagine-X-serine/threonine residues in the polypeptide chain (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985; Schrag et al., 2003; Schroder and Kaufman, 2005a). Glycosylation is a hydrophilic modification that can change the general properties of proteins as well as provide binding sites for carbohydrate-binding ligands. Processing of the glycoproteins begins in the ER by the enzymatic trimming of three glucose residues by glucosidases I and II and 1 mannose residue by α 1, 2 mannosidase. This sequential trimming of carbohydrate residues is monitored by calnexin and calreticulin as part of the quality control process (Fig. 2). Binding by calnexin/calreticulin retains the glycoprotein in the ER allowing foldases and disulfide isomerases to catalyze isomerization or exchange disulfide bonds that are required for the

Fig. 2. Glycosylation in the ER. Newly synthesized peptides enter the ER via the sec61 pore and are glycosylated by oligosaccharyltransferase. Terminal glucoses are removed by glucosidases I and II. Lectin chaperones calnexin (CNX) and/or calreticulin (CRT) interact with the monoglucosylated protein. If properly folded, the glycoprotein is deglucosylated and is sequestered into vesicles and exported out of the ER. Misfolded glycoproteins cycle between reglucosylation and deglucosylation while interacting with calnexin/calreticulin to achieve nearly native conformation. Glycoproteins that are terminally misfolded bind to BiP and are transported across the ER membrane for proteasome-mediated degradation.

correct tertiary structure of the molecule. ERp57, a thiol-disulfide oxidoreductase, is known to form transient disulfide bonds with calnexin/calreticulin-bound glycoproteins (Oliver et al., 1999). The immature glycoproteins, if correctly folded, are then transported in membrane-bound sacs to the Golgi for further processing. Improperly folded glycoproteins are reglucosylated by UGGT (uridine diphosphate glucose:glycoprotein glucosyl transferase), which recognizes the unfolded conformation. Reglucosylation by UGGT initiates interaction with calnexin and transfer to EDEM (ER degradation enhancing α-mannosidase like protein) that leads to retrotranslocation to the cytosol and degradation by the proteasome (Molinari et al., 2003; Oda et al., 2003). Glycoproteins released from calnexin and displaying major folding defects are ignored by UGGT. These extensively misfolded proteins are chaperoned by BiP.

### 2.2.1. Calnexin declines with age

Calnexin but not calreticulin has been shown to decline with age. There is a 29% decrease in calnexin in the aged rat liver (Erickson et al., 2006) and a 35% decrease in aged rat hippocampus (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006). Proteomic studies in an in vitro aging model system of human diploid fibroblasts indicate that there is a significant decrease in calnexin with aging (Choi and Kim, 2004). Loss of calnexin sensitizes cells to apoptosis through the activation of an apoptotic mediator ganglioside GD3 (Tomassini et al., 2004). GD3 activation and accumulation lead to its translocation to the mitochondria where it induces release of apoptotic factors, caspase activation, and collapse of mitochondrial membrane potential (Garcia-Ruiz et al., 2000; Tomassini et al., 2004). Calnexin prevents mitochondrial accumulation of GD3 by retaining GD3 synthase in the ER (Tomassini et al., 2004).

### 2.3. Disulfide bond formation and thiol-disulfide oxidoreductases

The formation of disulfide bonds is a critical step in the folding of a large number of proteins that traverse through the ER. Protein disulfide isomerase (PDI), also known as ERp58, is a member of the thioredoxin superfamily of proteins that mediate the redox-dependent folding and unfolding of proteins within the ER. PDI catalyzes native disulfide bond formation through thiol-disulfide oxidation, reduction, and isomerization (Ellgaard and Ruddock, 2005) and is therefore key to protein folding and quality control in the ER. Mammalian PDI is a multifunctional protein with both enzymatic oxidoreductase and chaperone properties (Hebert and Molinari, 2007). The cysteines at the active site CXXC motif of PDI can be present in both the oxidized and reduced state. For catalytic disulfide formation in a new polypeptide, the CXXC motif contains a disulfide bond that acts as an electron acceptor, while for the reduction of disulfide substrates, the CXXC motif is in a reduced state (Hebert and Molinari, 2007).

The redox state of the cysteine residues is controlled by the environment and by other proteins such as ERO1p that help to shuttle electrons in and out of the ER (Tu and Weissman, 2004). The major redox buffer in the ER is glutathione. The ER ratio of reduced glutathione (GSH) to oxidized glutathione (GSSG) ranges from 1:1 to 3:1, while the cytosolic ratio ranges from 30:1 to 100:1 (Hwang et al., 1992). It is known that GSH levels decline with age in brain in several species (Kim et al., 2003; Zhu et al., 2006). The mammalian PDI family consists of over a dozen members that include ERp57, Erp55, ERp44, ERp72, and ERdj. Erp57, also known as GRP58, interacts specifically with glycoproteins through association with calnexin/calreticulin (Oliver et al., 1999).

#### 2.3.1. Age-associated decline in PDI

A number of studies have demonstrated that PDI protein levels and PDI catalytic activity diminish with age. There is a 45% diminution in activity in the PDI enzyme in mouse liver isolated from aged (20–24-month-old) mice when compared to the activity in young mice 3–5 months of age (Nuss et al., 2008). There is a 49% decrease in PDI in the hippocampus of aged (24–26-month-old) rats compared to young (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006). Other members of the PDI family that also decrease with age include ERp57 and ERp55. There are 51% and 32% declines in ERp55 and ERp57, respectively, in the liver of aged male rats (Erickson et al., 2006). Both ERp55 and ERp57 catalyze glutathione reduction of protein disulfides and hence protect cells from oxidative injury.

Fig. 3. Schematic showing the three major components of the unfolded protein response. Misfolded or unfolded proteins titrate BiP away from the 3 transducers of ER stress: PERK, IRE-1 and ATF6. Activated PERK phosphorylates eIF2a to attenuate protein translation and phosphorylates NRF-2 to up-regulate the anti-oxidant response. Cleaved activated ATF6 leads to induction of molecular chaperones BiP, PDI, GRP94, etc. IRE-1 activation leads to XBP-1 splicing, transcriptional activation of chaperones and stimulation of protein degradation. The various ER chaperones, such as BiP and GRP94 are protective and control protein folding and components of the UPR. Modified with permission from Naidoo et al. (2008).

2.4. ER chaperones are more vulnerable to oxidative damage

Another important and perhaps critical change with age is that ER chaperones are progressively oxidized, thereby affecting their function. Oxidative metabolism leads to the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage proteins, lipids and nucleic acids (Berlett and Stadtman, 1997). The increased rate of generation of ROS roughly correlates with life span, and is thought to represent a major determinant in defining the rate of aging and development of numerous age-related diseases (Finkel and Holbrook, 2000). Studies where cellular levels of antioxidant enzymes have been up-regulated support strong correlations between the accumulation of oxidized proteins and life-span suggesting a causative role for ROS in the aging process (Finkel and Holbrook, 2000; Sohal and Weindruch, 1996). As a result, age-related accumulation of oxidatively modified proteins has been observed in mammals (Berlett and Stadtman, 1997; Rabek et al., 2003). Recently there have been specific reports of age-associated increases in oxidation of key ER resident proteins (see Table 1). BiP, PDI and calreticulin (for description of function, see above) are carbonylated in aged mouse liver indicating that protein folding, disulfide bond formation and glycosylation are all likely compromised in the aging mouse liver (Nuss et al., 2008; Rabek et al., 2003). These oxidative changes have also been associated with reduced enzyme activities of the chaperones tested (Nuss et al., 2008).

3. The ER stress response

Since the ER is a complex membranous network that extends throughout the cytoplasm and is contiguous with the nuclear envelope it can sense and transmit signals that originate in any cellular sub-compartment. Perturbations that alter ER homeostasis therefore disrupt folding and lead to the accumulation of unfolded proteins and protein aggregates, which are detrimental to cell survival. ER stress which can be provoked by a variety of physiological conditions, including perturbations in calcium homeostasis, glucose/energy deprivation, redox changes, ischemia, hyperhomocystinemia, viral infections and mutations is alleviated by the ER stress response or the unfolded protein response (Kaufman et al., 2002)

On a cellular level, the adaptive phase of the UPR triggers three kinds of protective cellular responses (see Fig. 3 schematic): (i) up-regulation of ER chaperones such as BiP/GRP78 to assist in the refolding of proteins (Kaufman, 1999); (ii) attenuation of protein translation which is mediated by the serine-threonine kinase PERK which phosphorylates the initiation factor—eIF2α thereby reducing translation (Prostko et al., 1993); and (iii) degradation of misfolded proteins by the proteasome by a process called ER associated degradation (ERAD) (Hampton, 2000). These three responses are protective measures to limit protein load and alleviate ER stress. When adaptation fails, ER-initiated pathways signal alarm by activating NF-κB, a transcription factor that induces expression of genes encoding mediators of host defense (Xu et al., 2005). Excessive and/prolonged stress leads to a maladaptive response and apoptosis (Szegezdi et al., 2006).

3.1. Transduction of the ER stress signal by three proximal sensors

ER stress signals are transduced across the ER membrane by three proximal sensors of the unfolded protein response, inositol requiring element-1 (IRE-1), PKR-like ER kinase (PERK) and activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6). All three of these sensors are maintained in an inactive state at the ER membrane by binding to BiP. Upon accumulation of unfolded proteins, bound BiP dissociates from ATF6, IRE-1 and PERK to chaperone the misfolded proteins thereby permitting the activation of one or more of these
transducers (Zhang and Kaufman, 2006). BiP therefore serves as the master regulator of the UPR.

### 3.1.1. PERK signaling and attenuation of protein translation

PERK is a type I transmembrane serine threonine kinase that appears to be present in most cells. Binding to BiP holds it in an inactive monomeric state. When this binding is disrupted, PERK homodimerizes and phosphorylates itself, thereby activating itself and initiating its eIF2α kinase activity. Phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor, eIF2α, results in the formation of a stalled 43S ternary complex that causes a general decrease in the translation of most proteins. However, some selected proteins with internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), such as ATF4, GRP94, and BiP, are translated more efficiently (Harding et al., 2000) and hence their protein levels actually increase.

### 3.1.2. IRE-1 signaling and selective mRNA splicing

Once activated, the cytoplasmic domain of IRE-1α gains endoribonuclease activity and cleaves 26 nucleotides from the mRNA encoding X-box binding protein (XBP) 1, generating a spliced variant (XBP-1s) that functions as a potent transcriptional transactivator of genes involved in ER expansion, protein maturation, folding, and export from the ER, as well as export and degradation of misfolded proteins (Calfon et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2003; Lee et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2001). IRE-1 may also degrade ER-targeted mRNAs, thus decreasing the production of new proteins in the organelle (Hollien and Weissman, 2006; Pirot et al., 2007)

### 3.1.3. ATF6 signaling and transcription of ER chaperones

ATF6 is a 90-kDa-bZIP protein that is activated by post-translational modifications. ATF6 activation as part of the UPR leads to its translocation to the Golgi and cleavage by site-1 protease (S1P) and S2P. The 50-kDa cleaved ATF6α translocates to the cell nucleus, where it binds to the ER stress response element CCAAT(N)9CCACG (Yoshida et al., 1998) in genes encoding ER chaperone proteins such as BiP and GRP94. This results in increases in the level of these proteins and hence increased protein folding activity in the ER (Okada et al., 2002; Yoshida et al., 1998). Other important targets regulated by ATF6 include XBP-1, CHOP, Herp (hyperhomocysteinemia-induced ER stress responsive protein), and PDI (Schroeder, 2006).

### 3.2. ER stress and apoptosis

Apoptosis in response to ER stress is specific to metazoan cells (Schroder and Kaufman, 2005a). When cell protective changes mediated by the UPR fail to restore folding capacity, a combination of both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways are activated ((Oyadomari and Mori, 2004; Schroder and Kaufman, 2005b). C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) also known as growth arrest and DNA damage 153 (GADD 153), together with Bcl-2 family members (Bak/Bax), caspase-12, and c-Jun NH₂ terminal kinase (JNK) are components of the ER stress mediated apoptotic pathway (Wu and Kaufman, 2006)—see schematic in Fig. 4.

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Fig. 4.** Sustained ER stress leads to pro-apoptotic signaling. Prolonged UPR activation leads ER calcium release and to cell death signaling. Activated IRE-1 acting on downstream factors activates JNK and caspases. ATF4 dependent transcription leads to increases in CHOP. CHOP is a pro-apoptotic transcription factor. CHOP inhibits BCl-2 leading to calcium release; higher calcium levels sensitize mitochondria to other insults inducing cell death. BCl-2 exerts an anti-apoptotic function in the ER. CHOP and JNK also promote the translocation of Bax to the mitochondria where it facilitates the release of cytochrome c required for caspase activation. ER specific caspases, such as the caspase-12, are thought to directly induce cell death through activation of caspases 9 and 3. Modified with permission from Naidoo et al. (2008).

3.2.1. The Bcl-2 family

Pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 members, Bak and Bax, undergo conformational changes in response to ER stress resulting in calcium release from the ER lumen. They also act on the mitochondrial membrane resulting in the release of cytochrome c and mitochondrial mediated caspase activation (Nechushtan et al., 1999; Wolter et al., 1997).

The JNK family represents a group of mitogen activated protein kinases (MAPKs) that are activated by cellular stress. Bax translocation to the mitochondria is also downstream of JNK (Lei and Davis, 2003; Tsuruta et al., 2004).

3.2.2. Caspases

The caspase family of cysteine proteases is a key mediator of programmed cell death (for reviews, see Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998 and Nunez et al., 1998). Murine caspase-12 which is a member of the interleukin-1β converting enzyme subfamily of caspases (Nakagawa et al., 2000) is an initiator caspase and the central player in ER induced apoptosis (Szegezdi et al., 2006). Once activated, caspase-12 translocates from the ER to the cytosol where it cleaves caspase-9, which induces the cleavage of the executioner caspase, caspase-3, in a cytochrome c-independent manner and activation of the rest of the apoptotic pathway (Szegezdi et al., 2003).

3.2.3. CHOP

CHOP is a transcription factor of the C/EBP family (Oyadomari and Mori, 2004). Under non-stress conditions the basal expression of CHOP is low. However CHOP levels have been shown to increase markedly when ER stress is not alleviated and persists (Zinszner et al., 1998). Some of the mechanisms by which CHOP mediates apoptosis include (i) the inhibition of protective anti-apoptotic factors like Bcl-2 and perturbation of cellular redox state by depletion of the anti-oxidant glutathione (McCullough et al., 2001); (ii) promotion of apoptotic caspase activity (McCullough et al., 2001) and (iii) the translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria (Gotoh and Mori, 2004). CHOP expression during ER stress is up-regulated by ATF6 and preferential synthesis of ATF4 following PERK dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α (Ma et al., 2002). CHOP expression leads to the induction of other pro-apoptotic factors such as DR5 (death receptor 5), GADD34 and TRB3 (Tribbles related protein 3).

3.2.4. GADD34

GADD34, a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-interacting protein, causes PP1 to dephosphorylate eIF2α, in the late stages of ER stress and relieve the translational block imposed by eIF2α phosphorylation (Brush et al., 2003; Szegezdi et al., 2006). Removal of the translational block in still stressed cells aggravates ER stress by increasing the protein folding load.

3.3. Impairment of the adaptive ER stress response and increase in pro-apoptotic signaling with age

Several recent studies examining the effect of age on the ER stress response indicate that there is a diminished protective response and more robust pro-apoptotic signaling (Hussain and Ramaiah, 2007; Naidoo et al., 2008; Paz Gavilan et al., 2006).

3.4. PERK dependent protein translation inhibition is reduced with age

The mRNA for PERK is significantly down-regulated by 27% in the hippocampus of 23–26-month old rats (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006). Induction of the UPR in young 3-month old mice using acute sleep deprivation as a stressor results in attenuation of protein translation as evidenced first by PERK phosphorylation followed by phosphorylation of eIF2α in the cerebral cortex (Naidoo et al., 2008). In contrast aged (22–24-month old) mice do not display the increase in P-PERK nor do they have an increase in P-eIF2α following sleep deprivation indicating that the protein translational block does not occur or is very weak. Hussain and Ramaiah (Hussain and Ramaiah, 2007) have found that the kinase activity of PKR (double stranded RNA-dependent kinase), an eIF2α kinase, isolated from aged rat brain tissue is less efficient than that from similar young tissue. They also demonstrate that phosphorylation of eIF2α is lower in various (brain cortex, cerebellum, lung, liver, kidney heart and spleen) aged rat tissues. Concomitant with this decline is an increase in GADD 34 in the same tissue with age. A similar increase in GADD34 expression occurs in the cortical tissue of the aged mice that further increases when the animals are subjected to ER stress during sleep deprivation (Naidoo et al., 2008). Removal of the translational block by GADD34 also facilitates the synthesis of pro-apoptotic proteins like CHOP.

3.5. Age-related increase in pro-apoptotic markers with ER stress

CHOP is a key marker of sustained ER stress. Our studies indicate that CHOP levels are elevated in aged mouse cortex (Naidoo et al., 2008) as others have shown in aged rat hippocampus (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006) and in aged rat cortex, cerebellum, lung, liver, kidney heart and spleen (Hussain and Ramaiah, 2007). We have shown in addition that CHOP is further increased in aged animals with sleep deprivation which causes ER stress. Young animals in contrast display lower levels of CHOP in the cortex and show no increase in this protein with sleep deprivation. Rather, in young animals there is dissipation of ER stress produced by the protective arm of the UPR (Naidoo et al., 2005). Similarly ER stress induced by the proteasomal inhibitor, lactacystin, did not result in CHOP transcript up-regulation in young rat hippocampus while there was a 49% increase in CHOP message in lactacystin treated aged rat hippocampus (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006). CHOP, which is controlled transcriptionally and translationally, is also regulated post-translationally by phosphorylation by p38 MAPK, which increases its activity (Szegezdi et al., 2006). These changes in CHOP with age and increases in CHOP with ER stress in old but not young animals will have important consequences. A role for CHOP in mediating apoptosis in response to ER stress is well established (Wang et al., 1996; Zinszner et al., 1998). Elevated CHOP also sensitizes cells to oxidative insults (Ikeyama et al., 2003) while ectopic expression of CHOP in rat fibroblasts leads to increased levels of ROS (McCullough et al., 2001).

Another change in the ER stress response with age is that in old animals, but not young, challenges such as sleep deprivation lead to activation of the caspase cascade. Activation of caspase-12, which is the central player in ER induced apoptosis, occurs during ER stress in aged animals but not in young animals. Lactacystin (a proteasomal inhibitor) induced ER stress leads to significant caspase-12 activation in aged rat hippocampus (Paz Gavilan et al., 2006), while sleep deprivation induced ER stress significantly increases caspase-12 cleavage in aged mouse cerebral cortex (Naidoo et al., 2008).

The c-jun NH₂ terminal kinases are also increased with age. They are signal transduction proteins that regulate gene expression through the phosphorylation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and ATF-2 (Davis, 2000; Urano et al., 2000). The JNK pathway is activated by exposure of cells to stress (Davis, 2000). Levels of activated phospho-JNK are elevated in the tissue (cortex, cerebellum, lung, liver, kidney heart and spleen) of aged rats consistent with the idea that cellular stress is increased with age (Hussain and Ramaiah, 2007). JNK appears to be required for the stress induced apoptosis mediated by the mitochondrial/caspase 9 pathway. Studies indicate that JNK acts on the Bcl-2 family of proteins by inhibiting the anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and activating the translocation of Bax to the mitochondrial membrane (Gao et al., 2005). The JNK family also plays a role in cell survival (Davis, 2000).

### 4. Conclusions

As outlined in this review the ER orchestrates a wide range of cellular processes and responses. This organelle, which is capable of both signal reception and transmission, is responsible for correct protein folding, modification, packaging, and transport, lipid and sterol synthesis, calcium storage and release. Perturbations to these processes are dealt with by a series of cell protective responses known collectively as the UPR. With age many of the key components of the UPR such as the chaperones and enzymes display reduced expression and activity resulting in a dysfunctional ER. Unresolved and prolonged ER stress leads to a more deleterious outcome with perturbed calcium homeostasis, increased protein accumulation, loss of ER function and activation of apoptotic cascades. ER stress has been implicated in the development of diabetes (Fonseca et al., 2007; Harding and Ron, 2002), atherosclerosis (Vasa-Nicotera, 2004; Zhao and Ackerman, 2006) and in many of the aging related neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Parkinson’s ([Lindholm et al., 2006; Yoshida, 2007] and Table 2). Whether or not the aged related changes in the ER stress response contribute to the initiation of some of these diseases remains to be determined and certainly warrants further study.
