Morphine has received intensive research interest for a long time. However, until recently, the protective versus destructive roles of morphine in the neuronal system have not been studied. There is evidence suggesting that morphine induces apoptotic cell death in neuronal and glial cells, whereas controversial studies support a neuroprotective role for morphine. The exact mechanisms for both protective and destructive pathways are not clear and are still under investigation. Improved understanding of morphine neuroprotection and neurotoxicity will be helpful to control morphine side effects in medical applications and to identify new targets for potential therapies and prevention strategies to opioid addiction.

Morphine is an alkaloid from the plant extracts of opium poppy. It has a long history as treatment for diarrhea and pain. Its potent analgesic and sedative nature makes morphine one of the best painkillers. On the other hand, unwanted side effects such as tolerance, physical dependence, respiratory suppression, and constipation greatly limit the clinical applications of morphine (Raehal and Bohn 2005). As one of the addictive drugs, morphine leads to increasing cause of death, morbidity, and lost productivity in society (Nestler 2004). Although used as a pain reliever for a long time, morphine and its cellular mechanisms were not well understood until the discovery of opioid receptors in the 1970s, which triggered an intensive search for endogenous opioid peptides (Zadina 2002). The presence of several types of opioid receptors to bind only to a plant extract, morphine, to which our system may or may not ever be exposed suggests that the existence of endogenous natural ligands for opioid receptors is plausible (Stefano and others 2000; Zadina 2002). Later on, the cloning of the opioid receptors and the availability of knockout animals of the opioid receptors significantly advanced our understanding of the molecular and cellular pathways regulated by opioid receptors, including neurotransmitter release inhibition, cyclic AMP (cAMP) regulation, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation, and G-protein-coupled action (Nestler 2004). More recently, the studies in opioid receptor trafficking, phosphorylation, and oligomerization have improved current knowledge of morphine tolerance and dependence (Bailey and Connor 2005).

Recent evidence suggests that morphine may play important roles other than analgesia, such as suppression of immune responses (Dinda and others 2005; Sacerdote 2006; Stefano and others 2005; Vallejo and others 2004) and modulation of tumor cell proliferation (Cadet and others 2004; Glasel 2000; Zagon and McLaughlin 2003). Morphine has been suggested to modulate cell death/survival in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS). Here, we review and discuss the recent progress on whether morphine is destructive or protective to neurons.

### Morphine and Opioid Peptides

It is difficult to trace when morphine was first extracted from opium poppy and used as a painkiller. The medical usage of opium to relieve anxiety and pain began around 200 B.C. In the 16th century, Paracelsus, a Swiss physician, named opium *Laudanum* because of its wide medical applications. Laudanum comes from the Latin word *laudare*, meaning “to praise.” English physician Thomas Sydenham, “the Shakespeare of medicine,” described in 1689 the popular use of morphine in pain treatments: “Among the remedies which it has pleased Almighty God to give to man to relieve his sufferings, none is so universal and so efficacious as opium.” In 1803, a German pharmacist, Derosne, described “salt of opium,” a precipitate obtained by the action of potassium carbonate on an

aqueous extract of opium. In 1817, another German pharmacist, Friedrich Wilhelm Adam Serturner, named the active compound extracted from opium as Morphia after Morpheus, the Greek god of dreams. The name morphine is now used instead of Morphia because of the standard that all alkaloids end in -ine. Morphine was the first product to be isolated from a natural substance. The name alkaloid, resembling an “alkali,” was adopted for this whole group of basic substances.

Morphine (C₁₇H₁₉O₃N) has a pentacyclic structure with a benzylisoquinoline nucleus supporting ether, hydroxyl, and olefinic functions (Calixto and others 2000). The related alkaloids such as codeine (morphine monomethyl ether) and thebaine can be also isolated from opium poppy (Calixto and others 2000) (Fig. 1). In 1898, Bayer registered diacetylmorphine (diamorphine) under the proprietary name Heroin in Germany as a cough medicine for children (Fig. 1). Several opium alkaloids and derivatives (codeine, thebaine, papverine, noscapine) were then studied for their chemical and pharmacological properties (Fig. 1). Morphine has been widely used in clinics because of its efficiency in pain relief. However, morphine also causes severe constipation, respiratory depression, drowsiness, vomiting, loss of appetite, confusion, blurred vision, dry mouth, and other adverse reactions. In addition, morphine is highly addictive, inducing tolerance and dependence after prolonged treatment (Raehal and Bohn 2005).

In contrast to the nearly accidental discovery of morphine, the isolation of opioid peptides was facilitated by the identification of opioid receptors. Major endogenous opioid peptides include enkephalin, dynorphin, endomorphin, dermorphin, casomorphin, and neoeンドルフィン (Bodnar 2007; Simon 1991). The endogenous opioid peptides bind with various affinities to 3 types of opioid receptors, named mu- (μ-) opioid receptors (MOR), delta- (δ-) opioid receptors (DOR), and kappa- (κ-) opioid receptors (KOR). Synthesized peptides have also been developed as specific agonists to these receptors, for example, [D-Ala²,N-Me-Phe⁴,Gly-ol⁵]enkephalin (DAMGO) to MOR and D-Pen²,D-Pen⁵-enkephalin (DPDPE) and Tyr-C-[D-Cys-Phe-D-Pen]-OH (JOM13) to DOR (Bodnar 2007).

### Opioid Receptors

The terms describing multiple opioid receptors were coined by Bill Martin and his colleagues in 1976 (Martin and others 1976). Different physiological profiles of respiration and blood pressure were reported in dog spinal preparations treated with morphine and nalorphin-like drugs. The authors concluded the existence of distinct subtypes of opioid receptors with different pharmacological preferences to various ligands: MOR for morphine, KOR for ketocyclazocine, and sigma (σ) for N-allylnormetazocine (SKF10047) (Martin and others 1976). Later on, with the study of reversal effects of

Fig. 2. Opioid receptor-mediated intracellular pathways. The downstream pathways of opioid receptors include cAMP, protein kinase C (PKC), phospholipase C (PLC), and protein kinase A (PKA). Opioid receptor also regulates neurotransmitter release and ion channels, such as potassium and calcium channels.

antagonists to agonists, another subtype of receptor, DOR, was proposed (Pasternak 2004). The sigma receptor was then found to respond to other psychoactive drugs, such as phencyclidine, and was removed from the opioid receptor list. Morphine is an agonist to MOR and a partial agonist to DOR with a nearly two orders of magnitude greater affinity to MOR than to DOR (Zadina 2002). The recent development of opioid receptor knockout animals has facilitated this field dramatically. For example, in MOR knockout mice, the spinal and supraspinal analgesia induced by morphine are completely blocked, suggesting that morphine antinociception is mediated by MOR activation (Matthes and others 1996).

In general, activation of opioid receptors leads to inhibition of neuronal excitability and neurotransmitter release through regulating the voltage-dependent calcium channels and the voltage-dependent inward rectifying potassium channels (von Zastrow and others 2003). By closing the N- and L-type calcium channels and opening the G-protein-coupled inward rectifying potassium channels (GIRKs), opioid receptor ligands decrease the membrane potential and alternate neurotransmitter release (Raehal and Bohn 2005). Opioid receptor activation also decreases cAMP by inhibiting adenylate cyclase, which is responsible for cAMP synthesis (von Zastrow and others 2003). MAPK is activated by opioid receptors (von Zastrow and others 2003). In addition, phospholipase C (PLC) and calcium-dependent protein kinase C (PKC) and protein kinase A (PKA) are regulated by opioid receptor activation (von Zastrow and others 2003) (Fig. 2). All opioid receptors belong to the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (Raehal and Bohn 2005). Activation of heterotrimeric G-protein is the major mechanism of multiple opioid receptors mediating the above cellular pathways. The binding of agonists to opioid receptors induces dissociation of guanine diphosphate (GDP) and

Downstream events

association of guanine triphosphate (GTP) with coupled G-proteins. G-proteins are then released from opioid receptors, and the α subunits and the βγ subunits dissociate, which induces downstream effector pathways. Hydrolysis of GTP-associated α subunits by GTPase triggers the reunion of 3 subunits and terminates the reactions (Fig. 3).

Phosphorylation and trafficking of opioid receptors are involved in many physiological processes such as desensitization, resensitization, tolerance, and dependence to agonists, including morphine (Bailey and Connor 2005; Johnson and others 2005; Raehal and Bohn 2005). Like many GPCR family members, opioid receptors can be desensitized and internalized after a prolonged exposure of agonists, which has been identified as a cellular mechanism of tolerance and dependence (Bailey and Connor 2005). For example, the commonly accepted hypothesis of MOR regulation is that after activation, receptors are phosphorylated by G-protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK), which triggers the association of arrestins to MOR. Arrestins then bind to AP-2/clathrin. Through the clathrin-coated pit, with the involvement of dynamin, MOR is endocytosed from the membrane into early endosomes. The endosome-located MOR can be either transported to lysosomes for degradation or dephosphorylated by phosphatase and then moved into a recycling endosome for the recycling pathway (von Zastrow and others 2003) (Fig. 4). Paradoxically, morphine is not as efficient in inducing MOR internalization as other agonists, such as DAMGO, in all the cell types that have been examined (Connor and others 2004). One explanation for this is that morphine does not induce phosphorylation adequately to trigger arrestin binding and further internalization of MOR. The supporting data come from the observation that overexpression of GRKs and arrestins can significantly promote morphine-induced MOR internalization (Connor and others 2004). However, it is still not clear whether morphine and other agonists such as DAMGO induce phosphorylation at the same or different residues of MOR and what the functional significances of these phosphorylations are. In addition, it is possible that different MOR ligands induce different downstream pathways, which may or may not involve receptor internalization. Also, various ligands may have distinct off rates to MOR. A fast off rate would promote more activation of receptors within a certain time span, whereas a slow off rate might be required for receptor trafficking (Connor and others 2004).

Morphine in the Antinociceptive Pathways

The general pain transmission ascending pathways begin from the primary sensory neurons in the skin or internal organs; these “first-order” nociceptors send signals to the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, which transfers the information to the thalamus. From the thalamus, the “third-order” neurons transmit the pain impulses to the cerebral cortex, where the signals are integrated and processed (Furst 1999). Morphine is recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for its potent antinociceptive effects to relieve moderate to severe cancer pain (Sakurada and others 2005). Other than cancer therapy, morphine has been used widely in acute and chronic pain treatments.

humans, the majority of morphine is metabolized into morphine-6-glucuronide and morphine-3-glucuronide, which contribute substantially to morphine antinociception at low doses and nociception at high doses (Sakurada and others 2005). At low concentrations (<50 mmol in mice and rats), morphine metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide binds to opioid receptors and spinally induces antinociception, which can be efficiently blocked by the

Fig. 5. Morphine antinociception pathways. Low doses of morphine metabolize into morphine-6-glucuronide and induce spinal antinociception. High doses of morphine turn into morphine-3-glucuronide, inducing increased release of glutamate and substance P (SP) at the presynaptic terminal. Glutamate and SP act on N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and NK1 receptors, respectively, at the postsynaptic site and increase calcium influx, which promotes the generation of nitric oxide (NO). NO diffuses back into the presynaptic terminal and triggers more glutamate and SP release. NOS, nitric oxide synthase.

opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (Benyhe 1994) (Fig. 5). At high doses (>30 nmol in mice and >100 nmol in rats), morphine triggers hyperalgesia (an increase of sensitivity to stimuli) and allodynia (a nociceptive response to an innocuous stimulation) instead of antinociception. In this pathway, morphine-3-glucuronide induces the release of nociceptive substance P (SP) and glutamate at the presynaptic sites, which activates NK1 and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors at the postsynaptic membrane. Activation of NMDA receptors, through an increase in calcium influx and calmodulin, mediates the increase of nitric oxide (NO), which can diffuse to the presynaptic sites and further trigger the release of SP and glutamate (Fig. 5). This positive feedback loop of morphine nociception is not sensitive to naloxone, suggesting that at high doses, in contrast to morphine antinociception, morphine nociception is not mediated through opioid receptors (Sakurada and others 2005).

Destructive Role of Morphine in Neurons

It has been shown that acute application of high doses of morphine may lead to neurotoxicity in animals (Hodgson and others 1999; Mao and others 2002). Chronic use of morphine has been reported to induce apoptosis in the parietal, frontal, temporal, occipital, entorhinal, pyriform, and hippocampal CA1, CA2, and CA3 regions of rat brains and the spinal cord (Atici and others 2004). Morphine causes increased neurotoxicity in human neuronal cultures with the apolipoprotein E (ApoE) 4 allele (Turchan-Cholewo and others 2006). A combination of morphine and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-1 Tat induces cell death in neurons, glial precursors, and astrocytes in mouse striatum (Khurdayan and others 2004; Mao and others 2002), which is especially interesting for studying the neuronal effects in morphine addicts with HIV infection. In rat primary cortical neuronal cultures, morphine is reported to increase amyloid β (Aβ)-induced lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and activate caspase-2 and -3 (Lin and others 2004). Knockout of MOR enhances the survival of hippocampal granule cell neurons (Harburg and others 2007).

It has been reported that some other addictive drugs, such as heroin, can induce apoptosis in several cultured cell lines. Heroin induces mitochondrial malfunction, caspase activation poly-ADP ribose polymerase (PARP)

cleavage, and DNA fragmentation in rat PC-12 cells (Cunha-Oliveira and others 2007). Neuroplasticity is impaired in the human hippocampus of heroin addicts (Weber and others 2006). This might provide a basis for the neurocognitive dysfunction that is observed in heroin-addicted human subjects (Fishbein and others 2007; Hill and others 2000; Tan and others 1994; Volkow and others 1988).

In addition to neuronal toxicity, morphine and its synthetic derivatives also have been reported to have anticancer activity, which is mediated through apoptosis (Gralow 2002; Ueda and others 2003). Morphine inhibits growth of various human cancer cell lines and suppresses release of two cachexia-inducing cytokines, tumor necrosis factor–α (TNF-α) and leukemia inhibitory factor, from cancer cells (Sueoka and others 1998). Some opioid receptors are found both in normal and tumor tissues, and others are found only in tumor tissues but not in normal ones, suggesting the possible roles of opioid receptors in mediating morphine toxicity in cancer cells (Ueda and others 2003). Although morphine, cannabinoid, and some opioid peptides have been shown to inhibit the growth of tumor cells, the exact mechanisms underlying the actions of opioids in relation to oncogenic events are unknown (Casanova and others 2003). Opioids such as cannabinoid are reported to inhibit tumor growth by receptor activation, but the observed tumor-suppressive effects of morphine are mostly not antagonized with naloxone (Casanova and others 2003). Opioids are demonstrated to influence the growth factor signaling pathways. Other evidence suggests the involvement of cytoskeletal elements in morphine-induced cell death, which blocks cells to the G2/M phase of the cell cycle (Eisch and Mandyam 2007). In addition, other indirect mechanisms suggest that hormones may be involved in morphine toxicity (Gralow 2002).

It has been suggested that immunosuppression occurs during chronic morphine use (Alexander and others 2005). Opioid-induced, altered immunomodulation may play a role in the increased incidence of bacterial infection associated with heroin addiction (Kovacic 2005; Liu and others 2007). Mice receiving morphine show enhanced bacteria infection and bacterial growth in samples of the peritoneal fluid, the liver, the spleen, the kidneys, the heart, and the lungs (Kovacic 2005). The immunosuppression has been attributed, at least partially, to a decrease of macrophage, which may be related to morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis. The apoptosis of macrophage has been shown to be mediated through the generation of transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β; Liu and others 2007). Morphine also affects the migration of monocytes/macrophages, a charge that might be mediated by the inhibition of chemotaxis. The decrease in macrophage migration is also reported to be related to the promoted expression of heme oxygenase-1 (Patel and others 2003b). Morphine-induced macrophage apoptosis might also contribute to morphine-induced inhibition of migration (Patel and others 2003b). Cotreating cells with morphine and simian immunodeficiency virus shows that the alteration in the balance of intracellular apoptotic and antiapoptotic

elements is one of the reasons for accelerated progression of AIDS by opioid abuse (Kovacic 2005; Liu and others 2007).

Morphine also modulates apoptosis of splenocytes. Splenocytes from morphine-treated mice show increased apoptosis and mRNA expression of cathepsin-B, a gene associated with programmed cell death (Singhal and others 1997). These results suggest that morphine may also modulate immune function by enhancing apoptosis of splenocytes (Singhal and others 1997). Furthermore, morphine induces apoptosis of thymocytes, which is mediated by hormones (Kim and others 1999; Sei and others 1991). Morphine enhances corticosterone levels, which in turn elevate a mode of cell death characterized with DNA fragmentation into 180 base pairs (Kim and others 1999). Panax ginseng blocks morphine-induced thymic apoptosis by lowering plasma corticosterone levels (Kim and others 1999).

Either high concentrations or repeated administration of low concentrations of morphine treatment induce hepatocyte apoptosis (Razaq and others 2007). Repeated treatment with morphine modulates the enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant defense of the liver. Moreover, coadministration of the opioid receptor antagonist, naltrexone, and administration of N-acetylcysteine, a potent antioxidant, prevents morphine-induced apoptosis. Fas (CD95)–induced hepatocyte apoptosis and cytotoxicity of neutrophils infiltrating the injured liver are two major events leading to hepatitis (Jaume and others 2004). Opioid receptor blockade improves the resistance of mice to Fas-induced hepatitis via a peripheral mechanism that does not involve a down-modulation of Fas mRNA in hepatocytes or a decrease in pro-inflammatory activity of neutrophils (Jaume and others 2004; Razaq and others 2007).

The mechanism of the apoptosis induced by morphine is unclear. Studies have shown that the growth-inhibitory or apoptosis-inducing effects of morphine in neurons are directly associated with morphine tolerance, suggesting a correlation of apoptosis with morphine desensitization (Mao and others 2002). Chronic treatment of rats with the MOR receptor agonist induced pharmacological tolerance associated with MOR desensitization and down-regulation (Mao and others 2002). MOR antagonist naloxone blocks morphine-induced apoptosis, suggesting involvement of opioid receptors (Mao and others 2002). NMDA receptors are suggested to play a critical role in morphine-induced apoptosis in the superficial spinal cord dorsal horn of tolerant rats (Mao and others 2002). Prolonged morphine administration also induces up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins caspase-3 and Bax as well as down-regulation of antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The general caspase inhibitor and caspase-3-specific inhibitor prevent morphine neurotoxicity (Mao and others 2002). The up-regulation of proapoptotic proteins FasL, Fas, and Bad and the active fragments of caspases-8 and -3 accompany the neurotoxicity of morphine (Yin and others 2006). After morphine, heroin, and cocaine administration, a key negative regulator of p53, murine double minute clone 2 (MDM2) gene expression, significantly increases (Jiang and others
2003). Chronic morphine application has been shown to increase c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) mRNA levels in the frontal cortex of rat brains (Fan and others 2003).

However, MOR antagonist naloxone has no effects on apoptosis-specific DNA fragmentation. The serine protease inhibitor *N*-tosyl-*L*-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) specifically inhibits apoptosis-specific DNA fragmentation induced by buprenorphine hydrochloride, a morphine alkaloid derivative (Kugawa and others 1998, 2000). Etorphine significantly inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in human neuroblastoma SK-N-SH cells, which is not blocked by naloxone, suggesting mediation by classical opioid receptor pathways (Yin and others 1997).

### Protective Role of Morphine in Neurons

Morphine has been found to be protective against microglia-mediated, lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, or 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium-induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity in rat primary mesencephalic neuron-glia cultures. Such inhibition of neurotoxicity does not require opioid receptors and is related to reduction of NADPH oxidase activity (Qian and others 2007). Although opioid receptor antagonists and brain slices from MOR-deficient mice show beneficial effects in a hippocampal hypoxia/hypoglycemia model, suggesting a destructive role of MOR in such an insult model, exogenous morphine preincubation improves the population spike amplitude of evoked field potentials, suggesting that preconditioning with morphine is neuroprotective (Ammon-Treiber and others 2005). In an earlier study reported by the same group, morphine was found to induce heat shock protein (Hsp)70 and Hsp27 mRNA in rat brains but not in HEK293 cells expressing MOR. Furthermore, the authors excluded the possibility of induction of Hsp70 triggered by increased body temperature by morphine and concluded that the enhancement of Hsp70 expression may be a mechanism of morphine protection (Ammon-Treiber and others 2004). Coadministration of morphine with dopaminergic agents decreases the severity of dyskinesias in Parkinsonian monkeys, whereas it does not affect the anti-parkinsonian efficacy of the treatment, suggesting that the increased production of opioids in the striatal pathway might have a protective role to compensate for the changes in synaptic transmissions (Berg and others 1999; Samadi and others 2003). Morphine preconditioning induces MOR-dependent neuroprotection against ischemia in rats and reduced ischemia-induced cell death in the CA1 regions of hippocampal slices (Zhao and others 2006). Furthermore, morphine preconditioning-induced ischemia tolerance has been shown to be mediated through a novel protein kinase C ε isoform (nPKCε) and NMDA receptors because morphine protection is greatly reduced by nPKCε and NMDA receptor-specific antagonists or by blockage of membrane translocations of nPKCε and NMDA receptors in mouse hippocampal slices (Fanjun and others 2006; Liu and others 2001). Morphine preconditioning-induced hypoxia and ischemia reperfusion tolerance and protection have been reviewed previously (Peart and others 2005).

The postconcussive syndrome refers to minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI)-induced long-term cognitive, emotional, and concentration difficulties; amnesia; depression; apathy; and anxiety, without clear morphological brain defects (Zohar and others 2006). An increase of endogenous opioid peptide release after brain injury suggests a neuroprotective role of opioids in mTBI (Lyeth and others 1993). It has been proposed that morphine-induced NO mediates neuroprotection in a human neuroblastoma cell line against intracellular oxidative stress and neuroinflammation (Rambhia and others 2005). Protection of morphine against peroxynitrite-induced apoptosis in primary rat neonatal astrocytes is mediated by phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) (Kim and others 2001). Morphine decreases β amyloid-cleaving enzyme (BACE)-1 mRNA but increases BACE-2 mRNA in human neuroblastoma HTB-11 cells. Down-regulation of BACE-1 and up-regulation of BACE-2 have been shown to decrease the Aβ level; therefore, morphine is suggested to be protective against Aβ toxicity (Pak and others 2005). The ubiquitin-proteasome complex is suggested to be involved in morphine neuroprotection. Morphine decreases 20S proteasome activity and increases free ubiquitin, suggesting that morphine neuroprotection is mediated through reducing the amount of oxidized proteins targeted for degradation (Rambhia and others 2005). In addition to morphine, anti-inflammation drugs called morphinans, a group of chemicals containing the basic morphine structure, are neuroprotective in several inflammatory disease models (Zhang and others 2004). In mouse dentate gyrus, acute cocaine treatment induces astrocyte proliferation and growth (Fatore and others 2002).

In addition to the protection in the neuronal system, morphine also promotes breast tumor and glomerular epithelial cell growth (Gupta and others 2002; Patel and others 2003a) as well as the survival of CEMx174 cells, a hybrid of human T and B lymphocyte cells, infected with simian immunodeficiency virus (Li and others 2004), probably by preventing p53 signaling (Suzuki and others 2003). It has been suggested that morphine promotes protection against metabolic inhibition in rat ventricular myocytes (Barrere-Lemaire and others 2005). Cardioprotection of morphine is mediated by glycogen synthase kinase β (GSKβ) inhibition (Gross and others 2004, 2007; Peart and Gross 2004). MOR activation by DAMGO induces three different effectors of PI3K survival and translational control pathways, including activation of Akt, phosphorylation of p70 S6 kinase, and 4E-BP1/4E-BP2, the repressors of mRNA translation (Polakiewicz and others 1998).

### Conclusions

With a long history of medical application and drug abuse, morphine and its action mechanism of antinociception have been studied for centuries. However, the protective/destructive roles of this ancient compound in neuronal systems have not been carefully examined until

the past 20 years. Therefore, there is only limited evidence supporting the two actions of morphine; in this regard, there are more reports on the destructive roles than for protective actions. High-throughput methods, such as genomics and proteomics, have begun to be used to explore new functions and mechanisms for morphine (Ammon and others 2003). The major challenge still remains to find how to handle and explain the huge amounts of data generated by high-throughput studies. Ultimately, our understanding of morphine action will be greatly improved with new technologies. On the other hand, accumulated knowledge of the molecular and cellular pathways of morphine action will lead to a definitive conclusion of morphine protective/destructive roles in neurons and other systems, which will be beneficial in limiting morphine side effects in the clinic and in the development of treatments, cures, and prevention for opioid addiction.
