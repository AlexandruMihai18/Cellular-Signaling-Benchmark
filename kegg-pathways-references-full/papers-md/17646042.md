Abstract

In mammals, an internal timekeeping mechanism located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) orchestrates a diverse array of neuroendocrine and physiological parameters to anticipate the cyclical environmental fluctuations that occur every solar day. Electrophysiological recording techniques have proved invaluable in shaping our understanding of how this endogenous clock becomes synchronized to salient environmental cues and appropriately coordinates the timing of a multitude of physiological rhythms in other areas of the brain and body. In this review we discuss the pioneering studies that have shaped our understanding of how this biological pacemaker functions, from input to output. Further, we highlight insights from new studies indicating that, more than just reflecting its oscillatory output, electrical activity within individual clock cells is a vital part of SCN clockwork itself.

Further, in an elegant series of psychophysical studies, Groos and coworkers determined that SCN neurons in various nocturnal species monotonically code changes in the intensity of photic retinal-stimulation (Groos and Mason, 1978, 1980; Meijer et al., 1986). A later study (Meijer et al., 1992) established that the magnitude of light-induced phase-shifts of hamster locomotor activity and changes in SCN cellular discharge rate were related, suggesting an initial step by which external stimuli influence the long-term activity of the circadian clock.

This psychophysical research demonstrates that the visual stimuli required to alter the activity of SCN neurons is considerably different from those which alter neural activity in other visual structures. Such studies suggest that visually responsive rodent SCN neurons are specialized for luminance coding in the range of light intensities typically encountered at dawn and dusk transitions (Meijer et al., 1986), implying that the non-image forming circadian visual system has evolved to selectively respond to low intensity photic stimuli. Interestingly, studies on diurnal species such as the ground squirrel (*Spermophilus tridecemlineatus*) or degu (*Octodon degus*) establish that, in contrast to findings in nocturnal animals, SCN cells are primarily suppressed by light (Meijer et al., 1989; Jiao et al., 1999), suggesting a neurophysiological substrate for species’ day/night preference.

### 2.2. SCN activity and behavior

A significant technical advance in our understanding of the SCN clock came through a series of neurophysiological studies made from freely moving rodents. These in vivo multi-unit recording studies conducted by Inouye and coworkers determined that the rodent SCN demonstrate a diurnal pattern of electrical activity, with a higher rate of spontaneous activity during the lights-on than that seen during the lights-off phase (Inouye and Kawamura, 1979, 1982). This pattern persists in animals maintained in constant environmental lighting levels, indicating that this circadian rhythm in the electrical activity of SCN cells is an active product of the clock and not a passive response to the external light-dark cycle. The autonomous nature of this SCN-generated circadian rhythm in electrical activity was demonstrated in rats in which synaptic inputs to the SCN region were surgically removed to leave an SCN-hypothalamic ‘island’. In such animals, SCN multi-unit activity continued to show a circadian rhythm, while other brain regions, which previously exhibited electrical activity rhythms in antiphase to the SCN, became arrhythmic.

Subsequent studies using multi-unit recording techniques have confirmed these findings and shown that the electrical activity of both chipmunk (*Eutamias sibiricus*) and Syrian hamster (*Mesocricetus auratus*) SCN also shows a pronounced circadian rhythm (Sato and Kawamura, 1984; Meijer et al., 1996; Yamazaki et al., 1998). Importantly, SCN multi-unit activity in the chipmunk, a diurnal animal, showed a similar profile to that determined previously in rats (i.e. neuronal discharge was higher during the light phase than during the night) as did activity outside the SCN. Similar results were obtained when animals were housed in constant darkness. These data suggest that a species’ day/night preference also reflects a differential effect of SCN output on downstream target sites (Fig. 1). It remains to be determined whether the results of these chipmunk multi-unit recordings are representative of other diurnal species. However, rhythms in clock gene expression in another diurnal rodent, the Nile grass rat (*Arvicanthis niloticus*), exhibit similar phasing to clock gene rhythms in the SCN of night-active animals (Novak et al., 2006; Ramanathan et al., 2006). Further, as seen in nocturnal rodents, light pulses during the night induce clock gene expression in SCN neurons of this species (Novak et al., 2006). Such findings are in marked contrast to the opposing effects of light on SCN neuronal discharge in diurnal and nocturnal rodents described above. In one of these studies discussed previously (Jiao et al., 1999) degu SCN neurons were recorded during both the day and night in vivo. In contrast to the chipmunk and grass rat data, degu SCN cells showed a (non-significant) trend towards higher nighttime firing rates. Thus, the circadian system of diurnal rodents may exhibit substantial species differences. It is also noteworthy that some degu and grass rats adopt nocturnal activity profiles when housed in cages with free-access to a running wheel (Kas and Edgar, 1999; Smale et al., 2001). While such animals may provide an important model for analyzing differences in the circadian system of day- and night-prefering individuals, such animals may not make the best model for studying the circadian system of diurnal animals in general.

Further, in vivo multi and single-unit recordings in rat show that behavioral activity feeds back to suppress SCN neuronal activity, with larger suppressions observed during the subjective nighttime. This behavioral feedback can be opposed to a certain extent by concurrent retinal illumination, indicating that the combined actions of these Zeitgebers are integrated at the level of individual SCN neuronal discharge (Schaap and Meijer, 2001). Collectively, these seminal studies established a neural output correlate of the endocrine and behavioral rhythm. Importantly, they suggested that the SCN clock might be composed of thousands of single cell oscillators with overt electrical rhythms being the product of their synchronous activity.

### 2.3. SCN activity in vitro

Another important evolution in the study of the mammalian circadian system came with the development of an in vitro brain slice preparation containing the SCN. Using extracellular recording techniques, Groos and Hendriks (1979) found that rat SCN neurons maintained in a coronal hypothalamic slice preparation were spontaneously active with a maximum discharge rate of 21.7 spikes/s. Based on the analysis of interspike intervals, they identified three patterns of SCN neuronal activity: regular firing (type I), irregular firing (type II), and bursty (type III). The relative preponderance of regularly firing type I cells in the rat SCN in vitro lead these researchers to speculate that such cells might form the elements of a neural clock. Shibata et al. (1982) also observed these patterns of SCN neuronal activity in vitro. A conundrum faced by these researchers was the dearth of type I cells encountered

receptors which might mediate such effects and the second messenger systems that underpin them (see Gillette, 1996; Gillette and Mitchell, 2002 for reviews).

### 3.1. Melatonin

The pineal hormone melatonin is one such chemical Zeitgeber whose action on the SCN has been extensively investigated with the in vitro clock model. In mammals, the SCN clock regulates the timing of melatonin synthesis and release from the pineal gland, via a polysynaptic pathway (Buijs et al., 2003; Stehle et al., 2003; Pevet et al., 2006). Circulating levels of melatonin are thought to communicate temporal information to a number of physiological systems and can also feedback to the SCN clock. In rat brain slices, perforated patch recordings indicate that melatonin activates an outward K⁺ current that hyperpolarizes SCN neurons (van den Top et al., 2001). This effect may underlie the predominantly inhibitory effects of melatonin on SCN neuronal discharge that is observed in extracellular single unit recordings in rat as well as Syrian hamster and Siberian hamster (*Phodopus sungorus*) slices (Mason and Brooks, 1988; Shibata et al., 1989; Mason and Rusak, 1990; Yu et al., 1993; Margraf and Lynch, 1993). These studies show a conserved rhythm in the responsiveness of SCN neurons to melatonin, with greatest sensitivity around the projected dusk. Early studies by McArthur et al. (1991) showed that melatonin could reset the electrical activity rhythm of rat SCN neurons in vitro when applied during this period of peak sensitivity, advancing the time of peak neuronal discharge on the days following drug application. However, subsequent studies in a number of rodent species demonstrate that the in vitro phase-resetting actions of melatonin are mediated by a different receptor to its acute inhibitory action on SCN neuronal discharge (Weaver et al., 1996; Liu et al., 1997a; Hunt et al., 2001). Further, an additional period of sensitivity to the phase shifting actions of melatonin has been observed in rat SCN slices (McArthur et al., 1997; Hunt et al., 2001). Thus, melatonin-induced inhibition of SCN neuronal discharge, mediated by the MT₁ receptor (Liu et al., 1997a), can be dissociated from its in vitro phase-shifting effects, which in rats and mice appears to involve an MT₂ receptor/protein kinase C dependent pathway (Liu et al., 1997a; McArthur et al., 1997; Hunt et al., 2001; Dubocovich et al., 2005). Other studies have also implicated nitric oxide in the phase-resetting actions of melatonin (Starkey et al., 1995; Starkey, 1996).

### 3.2. Glutamate

A considerable body of evidence indicates that the excitatory amino acid glutamate (see Colwell and Menaker, 1996; Ebling, 1996 for reviews) conveys photic information to the rodent SCN circadian clock; glutamate is present in terminals of the RHT (Castel et al., 1993; de Vries et al., 1993), ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists induce excitatory responses in SCN neurons in vitro (Bos and Mirmiran, 1993; Schmahl and Bohmer, 1997), optic nerve stimulation induces glutamate release from SCN slices (Liou et al., 1986a) and light or electrical stimulation of the RHT induces ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonist sensitive activations of SCN neuronal activity in vivo and in vitro (Cahill and Menaker, 1989; Kim and Dudek, 1991; Cui and Dyball, 1996). It is not surprising, therefore, that characteristic light pulse-induced alterations in the timing of rodent behavioral rhythms are blocked by antagonists of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptor (Colwell et al., 1990; Vindlacheruvu et al., 1993; Rea et al., 1993) and can be mimicked in the in vitro slice preparation by application of glutamate or NMDA (Ding et al., 1994; Shibata et al., 1994b; Shirakawa and Moore, 1994a). In these studies, NMDA receptor activation during the early or late projected night respectively delays or advances the occurrence of the SCN neuronal firing peak on subsequent days in vitro. In contrast, the same treatment does not alter the timing of neuronal rhythms when given during the projected day.

Using this in vitro preparation, a preliminary model of the intracellular signaling pathways involved in light-induced phase-shifting of the SCN clock has been developed. In this scheme, glutamate released from the RHT induces NMDA receptor-mediated increases in intracellular Ca²⁺. The phase-dependent sensitivity of SCN neurons to glutamate may be regulated by circadian variations in numerous inter- and intracellular signaling pathways; however, enhanced NMDA receptor mediated Ca²⁺-influx during the projected night (Cui and Dyball, 1996; Pennartz et al., 2001; Colwell, 2001) may be an important initial component of this gating mechanism. This critical first step initiates different cascades of events if it occurs during the early (Fig. 2) or late (Fig. 3) part of the night that appear to converge to reset the molecular clock. Calcium influx during the early projected night is augmented by influx through T-type voltage gated Ca²⁺ channels and release from intracellular stores through ryanodine receptors (Ding et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2005). In contrast, ryanodine receptor activity is not required for glutamate induced phase advances and L- rather that T-type channels appear more important sources of increased intracellular Ca²⁺. Different sources or levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ during the early and late projected night might then go on to modulate different signaling pathways. For example, glutamate-induced phase-delays involve cAMP/ protein kinase A (PKA) signaling whereas activation of this pathway opposes the phase-advancing effects of glutamate; instead PKG activity appears to have a prominent role in these late night actions of glutamate (Tischkau et al., 2000, 2003b). Recent studies on transgenic mice implicate the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Dexras 1 as a key component of the machinery controlling phase-gating of light responses by the rodent SCN (Cheng et al., 2004, 2006). During the early night Dexras 1 promotes phase delays via enhancing a Gᵢ/o-protein dependent activation of extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (ERK, a member of the mitogen activated protein kinase family) pathway and during the late night reduces phase advances via suppression of a Gβγ and cAMP-dependent activation of ERK.

These results provide initial indications that different intracellular signaling pathways underpin the phase-delaying

Fig. 2. Mechanisms underlying photic-type resetting in SCN neurons during the early subjective night. Glutamate released from the retinohypothalamic tract activates AMPA and NMDA receptors on SCN neurons, triggering Ca²⁺-influx through NMDA receptors and ‘T’ type channels. This Increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ is augmented by Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores through ryanodine receptors (RyR). Increased intracellular Ca²⁺ activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and Ca²⁺-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II (CamKII), which promotes extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (ERK) phosphorylation. Dexras 1 also enhances ERK phosphorylation at this phase. p-ERK in turn activates transcription factors which alter gene expression. Additionally, PACAP co-released with glutamate feeds back presynaptically to enhance glutamate release and acts postsynaptically activating the adenylyl cyclase (AC)-protein kinase A (PKA) signaling pathway. This activates cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB). In conjunction with ERK-regulated transcription, p-CREB alters the expression of genes including upregulation on the *Per1* gene. The resetting signal received by retino-recipient cells is then propagated to other cells by various neuromodulators including nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP).

Fig. 3. Mechanisms underlying photic-type resetting in SCN neurons during the late subjective night. Glutamate released from the retinohypothalamic tract activates AMPA and NMDA receptors on SCN neurons, triggering Ca²⁺-influx through NMDA receptors and ‘L’ type channels. Increased Ca²⁺ activates nitric oxide synthase (NOS) which promotes phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase1/2 (p-ERK) and cAMP response element binding protein (p-CREB) via protein kinase G (PKG). At this phase Dexras 1 reduces the ability of PACAP to enhance cAMP signaling, which through an unknown mechanism, opposes PKG-dependent activation of CREB. In conjunction with ERK-regulated transcription, p-CREB alters the expression of genes including upregulation on the *Per1* gene. The resetting signal received by retino-recipient cells is then propagated to other cells by various neuromodulators including nitric oxide (NO), vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and gastrin releasing peptide (GRP).
and advancing actions of glutamate in vitro. However, many of the steps involved in glutamate/NMDA induced phase-shifting appear common to both time-windows, such as NO generation and release from SCN neurons (Ding et al., 1994; Watanabe et al., 1994). Similarly, activation of ERK, phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) and induction of the Perl gene are components of the signaling pathways activated during both early and late night photic-type phase-resetting (Ginty et al., 1993; Ding et al., 1997; Obrietan et al., 1998; Coogan and Piggins, 2003; Tischkau et al., 2003a). Ca²⁺-calmodulin dependent protein kinase II is known to be important for the early night glutamate induced phase-delays, but its involvement in late night actions of glutamate have yet to be investigated in vitro (Fukushima et al., 1997). Biochemical assays do, however, support an involvement of this enzyme in both phase-delaying and advancing actions of light in the hamster SCN (Agostino et al., 2004). Recent findings also identify brain derived neurotrophic factor, acting via the tyrosine kinase B (TrkB) receptor, as an important regulator of ionotropic glutamate receptor signaling in the SCN (Kim et al., 2006; Michel et al., 2006a). Activation of this signaling pathway also appears to be involved in both glutamate-induced phase advances and delays.

In addition to actions on ionotropic excitatory amino acid receptors, metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) can also modulate SCN neuronal activity. Non-subtype selective mGluR agonists increase discharge rate in the majority of neurons recorded from the ventrolateral, and a minority in the dorsolateral, SCN of hamster hypothalamic slices (Scott and Rusak, 1996). No circadian variation in responsiveness to mGluR activation was observed. In self innervating cultured SCN neurons, mGluR agonists appear to inhibit GABA release and do not seem to exert any direct excitatory effects (Chen and van den Pol, 1998a), thus the authors suggest the excitatory effects described in hamster SCN slices may result indirectly from a decrease in gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic inhibition. More recently, Park et al. (2003) observed that mGluR agonists increased discharge rate in mouse (*Mus musculus*) SCN neurons around projected dawn, while antagonists of group I mGluRs (that couple to phospholipase C) increased firing rate when applied around midday. Thus, these data argue for a tonic excitatory effect of group I mGluR signaling during the projected day. This is in agreement with data demonstrating a decrease in the amplitude of firing rate rhythms in SCN slices from mice lacking a phospholipase C isoform that couples to group 1 mGluRs (Park et al., 2003). Unfortunately, despite these findings and the well-defined role of ionotropic glutamate receptors in regulating circadian timing, potential phase-shifting effects of mGluR activation have not yet been extensively investigated in vitro (but see Haak et al., 2006).

In sum, these studies implicate glutamatergic signaling as a key component of mechanism that conveys fluctuations in the environmental lighting conditions to the circadian clock. However, it has become clear from a number of electrophysiological studies that light-induced resetting of the SCN clock also involves the actions of a number of other endogenous SCN neurochemicals and signal transduction pathways (see below).

### 3.3. Pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide

Pituitary adenylyl cyclase activating peptide (PACAP) is present in SCN terminals of RHT neurons (Hannibal, 2002, 2006). PACAP alters neuronal firing rate in a subset of rat SCN cells in vitro, suppressing discharge in the majority of responding cells via an action on the VPAC₂ receptor and exciting a smaller group of cells, probably through an action on the PAC₁ receptor (Reed et al., 2002). This latter effect might arise through an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ which has been observed in many ventral SCN neurons following PACAP application to rat brain slices (Michel et al., 2006b).

High concentrations (1 μM) of PACAP are reported to phase-advance the rat and hamster SCN in vitro firing rate rhythm during the projected day but are without effect during the night (Hannibal et al., 1997; Harrington et al., 1999). These effects of PACAP are mediated by the PAC₁ receptor and require cAMP signaling. However, in the hamster, lower concentrations of PACAP are reported to produce a light-like phase-response curve (PRC) in vitro, effects which do not involve cAMP signaling but instead require NMDA receptor activation (Harrington et al., 1999). Such light-like phase-shifting effects of PACAP have not been observed in rat SCN slices; however, in this model, glutamate induced phase-delays require PAC₁ activation and are potentiated by PACAP whereas the converse is true for glutamate-induced advances (Chen et al., 1999; Reed et al., 2001). In support of this kind of modulatory role, PACAP is known to enhance glutamatergic signaling in ventral SCN neurons in a complex manner involving increased glutamate release and enhanced postsynaptic ionotropic glutamate receptor mediated currents (Harrington et al., 1999; Michel et al., 2006b). These findings tie in well with the observations that mice lacking PACAP exhibit reduced phase shifts and immediate early gene expression after an early night light-pulse (Kawaguchi et al., 2003; Colwell et al., 2004) and mice lacking the PAC₁ receptor exhibit reduced *c-fos* and *period* gene induction in response to similarly timed light pulses (Hannibal et al., 2001). In general these data support a scheme whereby PACAP facilitates light-induced phase-delays of the circadian clock by enhancing the actions of glutamate released from the RHT. However, the story can not be this simple: PAC₁ receptor knockout mice exhibit enhanced rather than reduced phase-delays (Hannibal et al., 2001). Further, PACAP knockout mice exhibit reduced phase-advances to late-night light while those lacking the PAC₁ receptor display delays in the timing of their behavioral rhythms (Hannibal et al., 2001; Kawaguchi et al., 2003; Colwell et al., 2004). These in vivo findings suggest further complexity in the actions of PACAP in the SCN (also see Piggins et al., 2001a) and may be partially explained by PACAPs actions (or lack of) on its other target within the SCN, the VPAC₂ receptor.

Although its exact functions remain to be established, in sum these data implicate PACAP in the complex set of inter- and intracellular signals mediating light induced phase-shifting of rodent circadian rhythms.

3.4. Substance P

Substance P (SP) is present in the rodent SCN and was originally believed to function as a neurotransmitter of the RHT in rat, although this now seems unlikely (Piggins et al., 2001b and see Hannibal, 2002). Anatomical studies demonstrate substantive species differences in the degree of SP-ergic innervation of the SCN and expression of one of its major receptor proteins NK₁ (Morin et al., 1992; Piggins et al., 2001b; Samuels et al., 2006). In the rat, an intense plexus of SP-immunoreactive axons and terminals is present in the retinally innervated ventral SCN, as is the NK₁ receptor (Larsen, 1992; Piggins et al., 2001b). In contrast, SP-positive fibers are sparse in mouse and hamster (*M. auratus* and *P. sungorus*) SCN and the NK₁ receptor is mainly expressed in hypothalamic areas bordering these nuclei. Intriguingly, results of in vitro electrophysiological investigations do not suggest substantive species differences in SP-NK₁ signaling in the rodent SCN. In rat and Syrian hamster SCN slices, SP, acting at least partially via NK₁ receptors, stimulates action potential discharge from a subset of ventrolateral SCN neurons in a circadian phase-independent manner (Shibata et al., 1992a; Shirakawa and Moore, 1994b; Piggins et al., 1995b). SP is also known to summate or potentiate responses to glutamate receptor agonists in the rat SCN and, conversely, an NK₁ receptor antagonist suppresses excitatory responses of SCN neurons to optic nerve stimulation in vitro (Kim et al., 1999). Therefore, regardless of whether it functions as an RHT transmitter, SP modulates responses of the SCN to photic stimuli. Accordingly, SP produces a photic-like PRC when applied to rat SCN slices (Shibata et al., 1992a, 1994c; Hamada et al., 1999; Kim et al., 2001). SP induced phase-shifts are blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists and are associated with an increase in glutamate release from the SCN (Hamada et al., 1998; Kim et al., 2001). In contrast, glutamate elicited phase shifts are not blocked by an NK₁ receptor antagonist. In aggregate these data suggest that, during photic-like phase-shifting, SP or NK₁ receptor activation facilitates glutamate release from the rat RHT. Since the pattern of SP innervation of the rodent SCN shows considerable species variation, and because the actions of SP in species other than rat and Syrian hamster are unknown, it is unclear if this putative role of SP-NK₁ signaling is conserved across rodents.

3.5. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide

Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is densely expressed in retinorecipient cells of the ventrolateral SCN (Ibata et al., 1989), which send diffuse projections to intra- and extra-SCN targets (for review see Piggins and Cutler, 2003), and a receptor for VIP, VPAC₂, is expressed throughout the SCN (Kallo et al., 2004). Despite being abundant in the SCN, an initial study by Albers et al. (1991) found that VIP alone had very little effect on the spontaneous discharge of Syrian hamster SCN neurons in vitro. However, more recent extracellular recording studies have indicated that VIP, acting via VPAC₂ receptors, primarily suppresses activity of SCN neurons during the projected night, with fewer cells responding during the projected day (Reed et al., 2002; Cutler et al., 2003). These effects appear to predominantly arise through inhibition of a number of membrane Na⁺ and K⁺ potassium channels (Pakhotin et al., 2006), although indirect actions on cellular discharge through a presynaptic inhibition of GABA release also contributes to the actions of VIP in the SCN (Reed et al., 2002; Itri and Colwell, 2003). In rat SCN slices, VIP phase-shifts the SCN firing rate rhythm in a manner similar to the effects of light or VIP microinjection on rodent behavioral rhythms (Piggins et al., 1995a), delaying or advancing the time of peak firing following VPAC₂ receptor activation during the early or late projected night respectively (Reed et al., 2001). Therefore, VIP is believed to act as one of the signaling molecules involved in photic resetting of the SCN clock. In agreement with this hypothesis, Per1 induction and increased electrical activity are observed in mouse VIPergic SCN neurons following a phase-shifting light pulse (Kuhlman et al., 2003) and, in vitro, a phase-delaying application of NMDA induces an increase in VIP release in the rat SCN (Shibata et al., 1994a). However, it appears that the signaling pathways by which VIP and glutamate reset the SCN clock in vitro diverge somewhat, since VIP-induced phase advances involve the PKA and ERK signaling pathways (Meyer-Spasche and Piggins, 2004), whereas glutamate induce phase advances are attenuated by inhibitors of MAP kinase but not PKA signaling (Tischkau et al., 2000). Nonetheless, like glutamate, exogenous VIP elicits significant increases in *perl* mRNA in the rat SCN in vitro when given during the late projected night phase (Nielsen et al., 2002).

Interestingly, VIP differs from many other neurotransmitters/neuromodulators believed to play a role in photic-resetting of the SCN clock, in that it produces mainly suppressive rather than excitatory effects on SCN neuronal discharge. However, VIP does appear to activate a subset of SCN cells (Reed et al., 2002; Kuhlman et al., 2003), and it may be these cells that are specifically involved in the phase-resetting actions of this peptide (Piggins et al., 1995a). The suppressive effects of VIP on SCN neuronal discharge may relate to other roles that VIP plays within the SCN such as the maintenance of cellular rhythmicity (see below).

3.6. Gastrin-releasing peptide

Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) is produced by cells in the ventrolateral SCN, where it partially co-localizes with VIP (Albers et al., 1991; Romijn et al., 1996, 1997, 1998). Activation of GRPs SCN target, the BB₂ receptor, produces mainly excitatory responses in approximately half of all rodent SCN neurons (Tang and Pan, 1993; Piggins and Rusak, 1993; Piggins et al., 1994; Pinnock et al., 1994; Reynolds and Pinnock, 1997; Cutler et al., 2003) and, at least in the Syrian hamster SCN, responsiveness varies with circadian phase such that more cells respond during the projected night compared to day phase (Piggins et al., 1994). These excitatory effects of GRP may in part result from inhibition of a resting potassium conductance and subsequent membrane depolarization (Reynolds and Pinnock, 1997).

Fig. 4. Phase dependent effects of exogenously applied receptor agonists and antagonists in the SCN. During the projected day endogenous AVP signaling stimulates SCN neuronal discharge and exogenous application of AVP produces no further increase in firing, whereas blocking AVP signaling with a V₁ receptor antagonist reduces firing rate. Conversely, the antagonist produces little effect on firing during the projected night since V₁ receptors are not being activated, while stimulation of these receptors with exogenously applied AVP increases action potential firing. Summarized from Mihai et al. (1994a,b); see text for further details.

In both rat and hamster SCN slices, BB₂ receptor activation phase-shifts firing rate rhythms with a photic-type PRC, similar to that reported for behavioral activity following GRP microinjection into the SCN (Piggins et al., 1995a; McArthur et al., 2000). Such GRP-induced alterations in the timing of hamster behavioral rhythms appear to require NMDA receptor activation (Kallingal and Mintz, 2006) and are associated with a relatively localized activation of ERK and expression of c-fos and Period genes in a subset of cells in the dorsal SCN (Antle et al., 2005; Piggins et al., 2005). This localization is in broad agreement with the distribution of BB₂ receptor expression and GRP binding in the mouse SCN (Aida et al., 2002; Karatsoreos et al., 2006). Interestingly, light appears to drive the expression of the BB₂ receptor such that it exhibits rhythmic expression under a light–dark cycle (peaking during early night), but not under constant darkness (Karatsoreos et al., 2006). Such a rhythm may help shape the PRC for GRP and underlie the reported circadian variation in acute SCN neuronal responses to GRP.

In sum, these data implicate GRP and the BB₂ receptor in the diverse set of intra- and intercellular signaling pathways through which light resets the SCN clock, consistent with the observation that mice lacking the BB₂ receptor exhibit reduced behavioral and cellular responses to nighttime light pulses (Aida et al., 2002).

### 3.7. Arginine vasopressin and somatostatin

Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is co-localized with somatostatin and GABA in cells of the dorsomedial SCN, and is thought to be one of the major output signals of the circadian clock (for review see Ingram et al., 1998). In hamster slices, AVP application produces circadian phase-dependent excitatory responses in the SCN mediated by V₁ receptors, with the majority of cells responding during the projected night and a minority during the projected day (Liou and Albers, 1989). Predominantly excitatory effects of AVP are also inferred from experiments in rat SCN slices, where V₁ receptor antagonist treatment reduced the firing rate of many cells, particularly during the projected day, suggesting that endogenous AVP stimulates action potential discharge at this circadian phase

1994b; Bergeron et al., 1999). Paradoxically, blockade of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, which increases neuronal discharge, is also reported to phase advance neuronal activity rhythms of the in vitro SCN (Mason et al., 1991; Gribkoff et al., 1999; Rangarajan et al., 1994; Gribkoff et al., 2003); however, this effect can be observed both during the projected day and night. Thus it appears likely that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists and antagonists phase-shift the clock through different mechanisms. Interestingly GABA is also known to synchronize SCN neurons in culture, inducing large phase delays when applied to clock cells ~6 h after peak firing (equivalent to projected dusk) and more modest phase advances when applied at a time point equivalent to projected dawn (Liu and Reppert, 2000). This PRC observed in cultured cells differs from that observed in brain slices, indicating that interactions between cells in a network such as the SCN slice are likely to exert important influences over how such cells respond to neurochemicals such as GABA.

GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor activation also reduces SCN neuronal activity; partly through presynaptic inhibition of RHT glutamate release but also through a direct hyperpolarizing action on a subset of cells (Liou et al., 1990; Jiang et al., 1995; Moldavan et al., 2006). Additionally, a GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated presynaptic inhibition of GABA release has also been demonstrated in cultured cells (Chen and van den Pol, 1998b). GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor agonists modestly phase-advance the in vitro SCN firing rate rhythm when applied during the projected day and cause small phase-delays during the projected night (Biggs and Prosser, 1998; Bergeron et al., 1999). Interestingly, unlike the effects of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor agonists, these effects are blocked by tetrodotoxin (TTX), indicating that action potential discharge is necessary for GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated phase shifting. Therefore, phase shifts induced by GABA<sub>B</sub> activation probably occur through modulation of the activity of SCN inputs and/or communication between individual clock cells.

### 3.9. Neurotensin

The hamster SCN is innervated by neurotensin containing fibers from the IGL (Abrahamson and Moore, 2001) and the rat SCN expresses mRNA for two receptor subtypes mediating the effects of this peptide, NTS1 and nts2 (Boudin et al., 1996; Alexander and Leeman, 1998; Walker et al., 1998). Single unit recordings in rat SCN slices indicate that the majority of cells respond to neurotensin application with an increase in firing rate, with a few cells showing a decreased spiking frequency (Coogan et al., 2001). This study showed no circadian variation in responsiveness to neurotensin, although a subsequent in vitro study demonstrated that neurotensin phase advanced the rat SCN firing rate rhythm during the projected day but not night (Meyer-Spasche et al., 2002). These long-term effects of neurotensin involved both NTS1 and nts2 receptors and a PLC-dependent mechanism. It remains to be determined whether these in vitro actions of neurotensin are paralleled by phase-shifting effects on rodent behavioral activity.

### 3.10. Serotonin

The SCN are densely innervated by 5-hydroxy tryptamine (5-HT) containing fibers arising from the raphe nuclei and contain a number of different subtypes of 5-HT receptors (for reviews see Pickard and Rea, 1997; Morin and Allen, 2006). Predominantly inhibitory effects of 5-HT on SCN neuronal discharge have been demonstrated in single unit recording studies, both in vivo and in vitro, from rat and hamster (Nishino and Koizumi, 1977; Shibata et al., 1983; Kow and Pfaff, 1984; Miller and Fuller, 1990; Huang and Pan, 1993; Ying and Rusak, 1994; Ying and Rusak, 1997). Rat SCN neurons in vivo reportedly exhibit increased sensitivity to 5-HT during the projected night (Mason, 1986). Agonists of 5-HT receptors also inhibit photic-induced activity in hamster SCN cells in vivo and optic nerve stimulation-evoked field potentials/excitatory postsynaptic currents in rat and hamster SCN in vitro (Rea et al., 1994; Ying and Rusak, 1994, 1997; Liou et al., 1986b; Pickard et al., 1999; Jiang et al., 2000; Smith et al., 2001). Further, 5-HT receptor agonists are known to directly activate a K<sup>+</sup> current in a subpopulation of SCN neurons, reduce postsynaptic responses to exogenously applied GABA and to presynaptically inhibit GABA release in the SCN (Kawahara et al., 1994; Jiang et al., 2000; Bramley et al., 2005). The pharmacology of 5-HT receptor mediated actions in the SCN is highly complicated; however, presynaptic effects on glutamate and GABA release involve 5-HT<sub>1B</sub> receptors. Modulation of glutamate release may also involve 5-HT<sub>7</sub> receptors, as may other actions of serotonergic agonists in the SCN.

Serotonin and 5-HT receptor agonists are also known to phase-shift rat and mouse SCN in vitro firing rate rhythms, inducing phase-advances when applied during the projected day (Prosser et al., 1990, 1992; Shibata et al., 1992b; Biello and Dafters, 2001; Prosser, 2003; Sprouse et al., 2004a,b, 2005). In rats these phase-shifting effects are believed to involve 5-HT<sub>7</sub> and/or 5-HT<sub>5A</sub> receptors, PKA activation, K<sup>+</sup> channel opening and nitric oxide (Prosser et al., 1994; Starkey, 1996; Sprouse et al., 2004a,b), and can be blocked by melatonin, NPY or glutamate receptor activation (Prosser, 1998, 1999, 2001). Interestingly, phase shifts of the mouse SCN in vitro are believed to involve 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> and/or 5-HT<sub>5A</sub> receptors (Sprouse et al., 2005). Further, an unidentified receptor mediates a modest phase delay of the firing rate rhythm in rat SCN slices following nighttime application of the non-subtype selective serotonergic agonist quipazine (Prosser et al., 1990, 1992).

It should be noted that the resetting actions of serotonin on the rodent SCN in vitro are somewhat contentious. Although some aspects of 5-HT effects in vitro are consistent across studies and species, investigations in vivo indicate that 5-HT receptor agonists such as 8-OH-DPAT do not reset Syrian hamster rhythms when given directly into the SCN (Antle et al., 2003). Further, confusion surrounds the early reported actions of quipazine on the SCN since subsequent in vivo studies have consistently shown that this compound has more photic-like actions in the rat (Kohler et al., 1999) and very little effect on behavioral rhythms in mouse or hamster (Antle et al., 2003). Factors such as duration of exposure to light and other variables
likely influence 5-HT’s actions in the SCN (e.g. Knoch et al., 2006), both in vivo and in vitro, and may explain these apparent discrepancies. Indeed, a recent study indicates that basal levels of 5-HT receptor stimulation are an important determinant of the ability of serotonergic agonists to induce phase shifts in vitro (Prosser et al., 2006). Pretreatment of SCN slices with agonists that enhance endogenous 5-HT receptor activation prevent phase shifts induced by 5-HT or 8-OH DPAT, presumably by promoting receptor internalization. These results suggest that a reduced level of endogenous 5-HT signaling in the SCN in vitro renders the preparation more sensitive to the phase-advancing actions of exogenous stimulation of serotonin receptors.

### 3.11. Neuropeptide Y

The SCN are innervated by neuropeptide Y (NPY) containing cells from the IGL (for review see Harrington, 1997). Single unit recordings from rat and hamster SCN neurons reveal circadian variation in cellular responsiveness to NPY with many more cells responding during the projected light phase (Mason et al., 1987; Albers et al., 1990; Liou and Albers, 1991). Interestingly, in experiments where it is bath applied, NPY most commonly elicits suppressions of SCN neuronal discharge (Albers et al., 1990; Liou and Albers, 1991; Cutler et al., 1998), whereas, when locally applied, only activations in firing are observed (Mason et al., 1987). One group suggests that NPY-induced excitatory effects represent direct actions on SCN neurons whereas inhibitions may occur through a transynaptic mechanism (Schmahl and Bohmer, 1997). However, NPY, acting via both Y1-like and Y2-like receptors, is known to mediate presynaptic inhibitory effects on glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling within SCN neurons as well as postsynaptic inhibitory effects on Ca²⁺ currents (van den Pol et al., 1996; Chen and van den Pol, 1996), thus mechanisms underlying the actions of this peptide on single unit discharge are likely to involve a complex mixture of direct and indirect effects. Further, one study demonstrated profound inhibitory actions of NPY on SCN multi-unit discharge in vitro that are mediated by Y5 receptors, while Y2 receptor activation produces no acute change in cellular discharge (Gribkoff et al., 1998).

In accordance with the general observation that SCN neurons are more responsive to NPY during the projected day, peptide application at this time induces large phase advances in rodent SCN firing rate rhythms in vitro (Shibata and Moore, 1993b; Medanic and Gillette, 1993; Biello et al., 1997; Prosser, 1998; Soscia and Harrington, 2005). One study reports an additional epoch, during the late projected night, when NPY also induces phase-advance of the rat SCN firing rate rhythm (Medanic and Gillette, 1993). NPY induced phase-advances appear to involve PKC, are blocked by depolarization (Biello et al., 1997) and are mediated by Y2 receptors (Harrington and Hoque, 1997; Gribkoff et al., 1998; Prosser, 1998; Soscia and Harrington, 2005). NPY also modulates the effects of other SCN signaling pathways, blocking in vitro phase-shifts induced by NMDA or light pulses (prior to slice preparation) during the projected night (Yannielli and Harrington, 2000, 2001; Soscia and Harrington,

2004) and PACAP, 5-HT or GABAB receptor activation during the projected day (Harrington and Hoque, 1997; Prosser, 1998; Biggs and Prosser, 1999). Interestingly, as with the acute effects of NPY on SCN neuronal discharge, these modulatory actions appear to be mediated by the Y5 receptor rather than the Y2 receptor which mediates phase-shifting effects.

#### 3.12. Summary

In general, chemically (or electrically)-induced phase-shifts in SCN firing rate rhythms measured from rodent brain slices in vitro approximate the effects of either photic or non-photic stimuli on rodent behavioral rhythms. Therefore, these in vitro models provide useful information about the types of SCN neurochemicals, receptors and signal transduction pathways that are activated by different stimuli to reset the SCN clock. The window of sensitivity of the SCN to phase-resetting by many of these neurochemicals in vitro often corresponds to periods of heightened sensitivity of individual cells to the acute effects of such compounds (e.g. GRP). Such periods of heightened sensitivity of SCN neurons could correspond to times when endogenous signaling by a particular substance or transduction pathway is low. Unfortunately, the acute or phase-shifting actions of receptor antagonists are often not investigated at circadian phases opposite to those where agonists exert maximal effects in order to test such a hypothesis. Further, there are clear exceptions to the generalizations made above and, in some instances, the receptors mediating the phase-shifting effects of a particular compound are different from those mediating its acute effects (e.g. melatonin, NPY). The functional relevance of such dichotomies remains to be determined.

Nevertheless, a general picture that emerges from electrical recordings of SCN neuronal activity is that stimuli that predominantly suppress cellular discharge (e.g. GABA) induce a non-photic pattern of phase-resetting (Mrosovsky, 1996) while those that excite cells (e.g. glutamate) produce photic-type PRCs (Meijer and Schwartz, 2003). Alterations in the timing of rodent behavioral rhythms following photic or non-photic stimuli may often reflect the interaction of multiple SCN signaling pathways, some which summate and others which oppose the resetting, possibly explaining why phase shifts measured in vitro are typically of larger amplitude than those seen in vivo. However, an additional possibility is that phase-shifts observed in vitro represent transient rather than stable resets, since assessment of such actions typically occurs 24–48 h following drug treatment. Further, these assessments are generally based on a relatively small number of neurons that are discharging at the time of recording. In these types of methodology, each cell is sampled only for a brief period of time and has to be firing in order to be detected, while studies using continuous single- and multi-unit recordings demonstrate unequivocally that many SCN neurons become quiescent during the circadian cycle (e.g. Gribkoff et al., 1998; Schaap et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2005, 2006, 2007). Therefore, phase-shifts assessed using such ‘discontinuous’ sampling-methods may not accurately represent alterations in the timing of
individual cellular rhythms or the population pattern of neuronal activity and should be interpreted with caution.

4. Ionic mechanisms

4.1. Basic electrical properties

The in vitro studies of SCN neurons maintained in hypothalamic brain slices or in primary cultures have also been important for characterizing the ionic mechanisms underlying both spontaneous activity and stimulation-induced changes in this activity. Early intracellular recording studies by Wheal and Thomson (1984) determined that rat SCN neurons recorded in a coronal brain slice preparation had a resting potential of ~-60 mV, a high input resistance ~147 MΩ, and action potentials of short duration (~0.8 ms) and low amplitude (~84 mV). Of note, these researchers observed that action potentials were followed by an afterhyperpolarization (AHP) of 10–20 mV in amplitude at membrane potentials around -60 mV. In subsequent in vitro intracellular recording investigations, Thomson and coworkers determined that only an early component of this AHP was calcium-dependent, indicating that unlike other pacemaker neurons, SCN neurons do not display a pronounced, long-lasting Ca²⁺-dependent AHP (Thomson and West, 1990). These authors suggested that at least one slowly inactivating inward current brings the cell to firing threshold and maintains tonic firing while both Ca²⁺-dependent and independent K⁺ channels maintain interspike interval. They concluded that in the absence of significant synaptic input, SCN neurons express a pacemaker activity that is sufficient to maintain regular firing patterns. The finding that regularity of firing pattern in SCN neurons involves Ca²⁺ was concordant with the results of an earlier extracellular recording study by this group which found that replacing Ca²⁺ with Ba²⁺ disrupted the regularity of the firing rate pattern of SCN neurons in vitro (Thomson, 1984). Another extracellular recording study by this group demonstrated that the firing rate of SCN cells is rate limited (i.e., SCN neurons fire spontaneously at around 5–20 spikes/s, but cannot be pushed to firing beyond this range). Further, when activated by glutamate, the firing rate of SCN neurons increases and becomes more regular in pattern (Thomson et al., 1984). Hence, regularity of firing rate in SCN neurons is a function of the basal firing rate. Building on these early observations, Pennartz et al. (1998) have described three populations of rat SCN neurons. Using whole-cell patch-clamping in current clamp mode, they made recordings from 109 SCN neurons in coronal brain slice preparations, and measured 16 biophysical characteristics, ranging from resting membrane potential to AHPs to evoked spike trains. When these measurements were assessed with cluster analysis, three populations of SCN neurons were distinguishable: neurons with irregular firing rate, small rebound depolarization, and monophasic AHP (Cluster I); neurons with biphasic AHP, small rebound depolarization, and regular firing (Cluster II); and low-frequent or regular firing with large rebound depolarization and biphasic AHP (Current III). Some of these 109 neurons were labeled with biocytin and

aspects of the cells' morphology noted. Although cluster III neurons appeared to have a larger number of axon collaterals than cluster I neurons, no clear link between these biophysical properties and cell morphology could be established. Another group (Jiang et al., 1997a) was able to demonstrate significant differences in the electrophysiological properties of SCN neurons, based on the four morphological classes described by van den Pol (1980). Principally, they found that monopolar neurons showed a lower mean holding current, conductance, and depolarization-activated cation current (Iₕ) than curly bipolar neurons. Unfortunately, it is still unclear how (or whether) either of the classification schemes described above relates to clock-like activities or neurochemical phenotype of SCN neurons.

4.2. Inputs to SCN neurons

Wheal and Thomson (1984) made the important observation that electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm (or contralateral SCN) evoked depolarizing potentials in the majority of cells recorded in the ventral SCN and altered their firing pattern. More recent studies in which intracellular recordings were made from rodent SCN neurons contained in a parasagittal hypothalamic slice preparation have confirmed many of the electrical properties of SCN cells as determined by Thomson and coworkers and described the nature of the optic nerve input to these cells, the basis of excitatory inputs to SCN cells, and the nature of inhibitory influences on SCN neurons in vitro (Kim and Dudek, 1991, 1992, 1993). These authors showed that optic nerve stimulation evoked an excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) from rodent SCN neurons and that both NMDA and non-NMDA receptors mediated these excitatory effects. Electrical stimulation at a site dorsocaudal to the SCN evoked an inhibitory postsynaptic potential (IPSP) which could be blocked by bicuculline, indicating that GABA_A receptors mediated this stimulation-induced inhibitory influence on rodent SCN neurons. In many neurons, spontaneous IPSPs could be recorded and these were eliminated by inclusion of bicuculline in the medium bathing the slice. Further studies indicated that optic nerve stimulation-evoked EPSPs of rodent SCN neurons involved time-dependent inward rectification. These important preliminary studies demonstrated that major excitatory inputs to SCN neurons came from glutamatergic sources whereas inhibitory inputs were modulated by GABA_A receptors.

4.3. Ionic basis of rhythmic firing

Experiments using the whole-cell patch-clamp technique have been invaluable in the determination of the ionic basis of the circadian rhythm of action potential firing in rodent SCN neurons. Building on the previous observation that an inward rectification may determine the level of excitability of an SCN neuron, Bouskila and Dudek (1995a) described calcium-independent depolarization-activated K⁺ currents in SCN neurons maintained in a coronal hypothalamic slice in vitro. They found both a rapidly activating and slowly inactivating

type of outward rectifier ($I_{\text{K(FR)}}$) and a transient A-current ($I_A$) in all SCN neurons tested in the SCN, and in all sites throughout the nucleus. The observation that a tetraethylammonium (TEA)-sensitive K⁺ current oscillates in the circadian pacemaker of the *Bulla gouldiana* (Michel et al., 1993) raised the possibility that $I_{\text{K(FR)}}$, a TEA-sensitive current present in SCN neurons, would provide the ionic basis for the circadian rhythm in the electrical activity of rodent SCN. However, no correlation between circadian time and the conductance of $I_{\text{K(FR)}}$ was detectable. They hypothesized that this current underlies the waveform shape rather than the timing of the action potentials. Since $I_A$ is known to have many modulatory roles it is possible that it might affect the circadian rhythm in spontaneous firing rate in the SCN by altering the duration of the interspike interval. Unfortunately, they did not test for a correlation between circadian time and the current of $I_A$. De Jeu et al. (2002) also describe an outwardly rectifying K⁺ current present in most SCN neurons that is sensitive to TEA and Ba²⁺. This Ba²⁺-sensitive potassium current acts to reduce SCN neuronal discharge and, unlike $I_{\text{K(FR)}}$, is active around resting membrane potential. However, this current also did not exhibit statistically significant circadian variation.

Another candidate current is the time and voltage-dependent mixed Na⁺/K⁺ inward current or ‘H’ current ($I_H$) that is activated by membrane depolarization (Akasu and Shoji, 1994). When activated, this current is thought to allow K⁺ to re-enter the cell and facilitate its restoration to membrane potential, hence enabling the cell to be excited again. This current was found to be present in about 90% of SCN neurons tested in a transverse hypothalamic slice preparation in vitro. However, $I_H$ was found to have no effect on spontaneous firing rate or resting membrane potential and did not appear to be modulated in a circadian manner (De Jeu and Pennartz, 1997).

A study by Allen and coworkers (Jiang et al., 1997a) also failed to find any evidence that $I_H$ varied in a circadian manner. Importantly, however, this group demonstrated a circadian variation in the mean input conductance and holding current required to maintain SCN membrane potential at –60 mV ($I$-60) in rat SCN neurons in a horizontal slice preparation. Mean input conductance was higher in neurons tested near the projected dawn (CT22–24) and lower near projected dusk (CT13–15). $I$-60 was lowest at the middle portion of the projected day (CT6.1) and highest during the middle of the projected night (CT18.1). These were unaffected by GABA or glutamate antagonists, indicating that they are a property of an intrinsic circadian oscillator.

Several other studies report similar day-night variations in membrane potential and input conductance that do not appear to depend on synaptic inputs (De Jeu et al., 1998; Pennartz et al., 2002). Schaap et al. (1999) made the important observation that rhythms in firing rate and input conductance were lost during prolonged whole cell recording of SCN neurons. These findings suggest that at least one of the mechanisms maintaining these rhythms in SCN neuronal activity is dependent on soluble cytoplasmic factors. The higher input conductance of SCN neurons during the projected night, coupled with a lower membrane potential, suggests that

hyperpolarizing (K⁺ or Cl⁻) channels are more active at this time than during the projected day. Further, comparing the initial firing rate of SCN neurons with that observed after prolonged recording during both day and night conditions suggests that the putative cytoplasmic factors driving this rhythm suppress the activity of these channels during the projected day (Fig. 5). Kuhlman and McMahon (2004) observed a similar rhythm in SCN neuronal physiology which they attribute to an enhanced TEA-sensitive K⁺ current during the projected night phase. Importantly this latter study was performed on mice maintained in constant darkness, ruling out any driving effects of a light-dark cycle. This TEA-sensitive current exhibits similar characteristics to the Ba²⁺-sensitive K⁺ current observed by De Jeu et al. (2002), with the lack of rhythm detected in this earlier study possibly resulting from intracellular dialysis during whole cell recordings.

In addition to fluctuations in this outward K⁺ current, Pennartz et al. (2002) provide evidence that L-type Ca²⁺ currents may be important for the circadian rhythm in SCN neuronal discharge. When action potentials are blocked, the membrane potential of SCN neurons oscillates at a similar frequency to the typical firing rate of these cells during the projected day. In contrast, such membrane potential oscillations were not observed in SCN neurons during the projected night, even following membrane depolarization. Daytime oscillations in SCN neurons required the activity of L-type Ca²⁺ channels and the current through such channels was found to be larger during the projected day than night. Although these oscillations probably play important roles in maintaining rhythmic activity within the SCN neuronal network, studies in dissociated dorsal SCN neurons suggest that the role of L-type Ca²⁺ currents in generating spontaneous firing is relatively minor (Jackson et al., 2004). In this model, a slowly inactivating TTX-sensitive Na⁺ current, which is present in nearly all SCN neurons, generates depolarizing ramps that provide the driving force for spontaneous discharge (Pennartz et al., 1997; Kononenko et al., 2004a; Jackson et al., 2004). It is currently unknown whether this Na⁺ current is subject to circadian modulation. Other studies suggest that depolarizing currents through TTX-insensitive cation channels that are open at resting membrane potential or additional voltage-activated Ca²⁺ channels, particularly R-type, may be important for promoting spontaneous SCN neuronal discharge (Cloues and Sather, 2003; Kononenko et al., 2004b; Pierson et al., 2005). Again, it is unclear whether any of these currents do indeed undergo circadian regulation or contribute to the expression of SCN neuronal firing rate rhythms.

In addition to the rhythms in membrane potential and conductance described above, Schaap et al. (1999) observed that cells recorded during the projected night maintain higher spiking frequencies in response to current injection than day cells and show less after-train hyperpolarization. These properties could result from a decreased nighttime Ca²⁺ current which would, in turn, reduce activity of various Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels involved in the AHP (KCa: Cloues and Sather, 2003; Teshima et al., 2003). This reduced spike rate adaptation may be important for gating of excitatory stimuli by SCN

T.M. Brown, H.D. Piggins / Progress in Neurobiology 82 (2007) 229–255

Fig. 5. Ionic mechanisms underlying action potential discharge rhythms in SCN neurons. Spontaneous firing in SCN neurons is dependent on the activity of a slowly inactivating Na⁺ channel (2) which opens at around –60 mV, depolarizing cells and activating fast Na⁺ channels (3) and high-voltage activated Ca²⁺ channels (4). Action potentials are then terminated by Ca²⁺-dependent (6 and 7) and independent K⁺ channels (5). During the subjective night (left), efflux through a tetrathylammonia (TEA)-sensitive K⁺ channel (1) hyperpolarizes SCN neurons, decreasing their chance of reaching firing threshold. During an action potential, reduced Ca²⁺ influx through L-type channels (4) and K⁺ efflux through fast-delayed rectifier channels, and enhanced activity of Iberiotoxin (IBTX)-sensitive Ca²⁺ activated K⁺ channels result in broader action potentials and slower repolarization. During the subjective day (right) soluble cytoplasmic factors suppress activity of hyperpolarizing TEA-sensitive K⁺ channels (1), promoting action potential discharge. Enhanced L-type Ca²⁺ currents (4) and K⁺ currents through fast delayed rectifier channels (5) promote rapid action potential upswing and repolarization. Additionally, a relatively greater activity of IBTX-insensitive Ca²⁺ activated K⁺ channels (7) during the projected day may also promote rapid repolarization, enabling SCN neurons to maintain higher firing rates than during the subjective night.

neurons so that they only induce phase shifts during the projected night. Conversely, during the day KCa channel might allow SCN neurons to sustain high firing rates by enabling faster repolarization. In support of this suggestion, Cloues and Sather observed that the magnitude of the AHP, which is largely determined by an apamin- and iberiotoxin-insensitive KCa channel, is correlated with spiking frequency while its duration is inversely correlated. Interestingly, however, Pitts et al. (2006) report that an iberiotoxin-sensitive large conductance KCa channel (BKCa) is expressed with a diurnal rhythm in the mouse SCN, peaking during the night phase. Blockade of this channel tends to increase spike frequency during the projected night, whereas blockade during the day decreases spike frequency. Further, mice that do not make BKCa channels (Kcnma1⁻/⁻) exhibit similarly elevated nighttime SCN firing frequency and moderately impaired physiological and behavioral rhythms (Meredith et al., 2006). However, there are differences in the circadian phenotype of Kcnma1⁻/⁻ mice depending on their genetic background (C57BL/6J or FVB/NJ), suggesting that the exact roles of different KCa channel subtypes may vary between species/strains of animals. Despite this, KCa channels are clearly important regulators of SCN neuronal excitability and interact with other ionic currents in a complex manner to help generate circadian rhythms in action potential frequency.

A diurnal rhythm in the activity of the Na⁺/K⁺ATPase has also been observed, in ventral rat SCN neurons (Wang and Huang, 2004, 2006). Activity of this pump, which hyperpolarizes cells by transporting 3Na⁺ ions out of the cell for 2K⁺

ions inside, is larger during the projected day than during the night. Counter-intuitively, blockade of Na⁺/K⁺ATPase activity increases SCN neuronal firing rate. Therefore, it seems unlikely that this rhythm drives oscillations in SCN neuronal discharge, as enhanced pump activity would oppose the previous reported rhythms in cell membrane potential and firing rate. However, Na⁺/K⁺ATPase may well be controlled by the clock in order to compensate for the enhanced electrical activity of SCN neurons during the subjective day.

Recently, Colwell’s group demonstrated that a fast delayed-rectifier K⁺ current is under circadian regulation in SCN neurons (Itri et al., 2005). In the mouse SCN this current peaks during the projected day and is believed to be important for neurons to sustain high firing frequencies by enabling rapid repolarization. The channels mediating these currents (Kv3.1 and Kv3.2) are expressed in the SCN with a diurnal rhythm and, further, the authors provide evidence that this K⁺ current is indeed important for expression of the SCN firing rate rhythm; when the current is blocked with 4-aminopyridine the SCN multi-unit activity shows little or no evidence of circadian variation over a 20 h recording epoch.

### 4.4. Summary

While the single and multi-unit recording studies described previously suggest means by which changes in the electrical activities of cells may (or may not) lead to alterations in the timing of molecular rhythms, these studies provide initial steps
in delineating how the molecular clock controls the firing rate rhythm of SCN neurons (Fig. 5). The neuronal firing rate rhythm seems to be driven by K⁺ currents that are most active during projected night and hyperpolarize cells preventing them from firing action potentials. Activity of the channels responsible for this current appears to be suppressed by soluble cytoplasmic factors present during the projected day, but could also be under direct transcriptional control by clock. Closure of these K⁺ channels during the projected day would then be expected to promote activity of the slowly inactivating Na⁺ current thought to provide the depolarizing drive for spontaneous firing in SCN neurons. Further, an array of additional channels are believed to promote high daytime firing by enabling rapid de- and repolarization, including Kv3.1 and Kv3.2, L-type Ca²⁺ channels and Kₐ channels. These first two are most active during the projected day as a result of their increased expression at this time. It is unclear what drives the reported rhythm in Ca²⁺ currents; however, it cannot be simply ascribed to the relatively depolarized resting membrane potential of SCN neurons during the day, suggesting that channel activity, number or expression patterns are regulated in some manner by the clock. Recent data indicate that activity of ibertoxin-sensitive BKₐ channels is down-regulated by the clock during the day; however, increased intracellular Ca²⁺ at this phase might drive rhythms in activity of other Kₐ channels which act in concert with the fast-delayed rectifier to expedite the AHP.

The studies discussed above have focused on understanding how rhythms in SCN neuronal activity are controlled, with the ultimate aim of relating this back to the molecular oscillator within the cell. While we are beginning to understand the types of ion channels that are involved in these kinds of processes it is still unclear whether all the mechanisms described above operate in all cells (as illustrated in Fig. 5), or whether different classes of SCN neurons regulate the expression or activity of different complements of ion channels to modulate their firing characteristics. Additionally, it is likely that other ion channels responsible for generating rhythms in SCN neuronal firing remain to be discovered and it is clear that we have only scratched the surface in attempts to understand how the activities of such channels are regulated.

### 5. SCN cellular and network properties

#### 5.1. Cellular elements

The development of SCN cell cultures has been instrumental in electrophysiologically determining a number of properties of the circadian clock and its cellular components. Pioneering studies by Bos and Mirmiran (1990) indicated that rat SCN neurons maintained in an organotypic slice preparation demonstrated circadian rhythmicity in the spontaneous electrical activity, whereas cortical neurons or neurons from the lateral hypothalamic area did not. The discharge patterns of these cultured SCN neurons were similar to those of adult SCN neurons maintained in slice preparations. Subsequent studies by this group showed that cultured SCN neurons respond to GABAergic and glutamatergic drugs in a manner similar to adult SCN neurons in brain slices, indicating that they expressed similar classes of neurochemical receptors (Bos and Mirmiran, 1993).

Other research groups have used SCN cultures to investigate electrophysiological properties of these neurons, to study the effects of neurochemicals on intracellular calcium levels, and to measure the rhythmicity of release of a number of neurochemicals into the culture medium (Murakami et al., 1991; van den Pol et al., 1992; Huang, 1993; Tominaga et al., 1994a; Walsh et al., 1992, 1995). These studies have determined that SCN cells maintain endocrine, as well as electrical rhythmicity.

The use of SCN cultures has enabled researchers to study the pacemaking properties of individual SCN neurons. An elegant study by Welsh et al. (1995) cultured rat SCN neurons onto multi-electrode array plates. On these arrays, spontaneous electrical activity of SCN neurons could be recorded. They found that about 53% of cells cultured in this way demonstrated circadian rhythmicity in electrical activity. Importantly, there was no evidence of coupling among the cells in the culture, with some neurons 180° out of phase with each other. The period of the spontaneous electrical activity was about 24.35 h, and ranged from 21.25 to 26.25 h. Blockade of action potential production by inclusion of TTX in the culture medium did not affect the phase of the activity once the toxin had washed out. This indicates that the maintenance of circadian phase in individual pacemaker cells does not depend on action potential generation and is consistent with results from in vivo behavioral investigations and neurophysiological data from SCN hypothalamic slices (Schwartz et al., 1987; Shibata and Moore, 1993a; however see below).

Other groups have replicated these extraordinary findings (e.g. Honma et al., 1998). Further studies by Reppert’s group have indicated that the average periodicity in electrical activity of SCN neurons cultured from tau mutant Syrian hamsters is about 20 h, which is concordant with the period of these animals behavioral rhythm (Liu et al., 1997b). In contrast, the mean period of electrical rhythms in SCN neurons from wildtype Syrian hamsters was around 24 h, as expected. These studies show that many individual SCN neurons can function as pacemakers and led to the initial suggestion that the periodicity in animals’ behavior reflects an averaging of the periods of many individual cellular oscillators. However, a number of theoretical and experimental demonstrations have thrown doubt on these ideas (Bouskila and Dudek, 1995b; Herzog et al., 1997, 2004). For example, rodent behavioral rhythms, or individual cells recorded from cultured SCN explants exhibit less variability in their free-running periods than observed in cultures of dissociated cells. Thus, it is now generally accepted that some property/properties of the intact SCN network synchronize the periods of individual cellular oscillators. In contrast, the phase differences among individual SCN cells observed in culture are partially preserved in explants or acute brain slices, i.e. some neurons express rhythms that peak ~12 h apart (Herzog et al., 1997; Quintero et al., 2003; Schaap et al., 2003; Fig. 6).

Dispersed SCN cell culture

Intact SCN

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yourimageurl.png)

Fig. 6. Network interactions regulate period and phase of SCN neuronal rhythms. In dispersed cell cultures SCN neurons are not strongly coupled to one-another. Under these conditions, some cells become arrhythmic while rhythmic cells express a wide range of free-running periods and adopt a random phase relationship with respect to other cells in the culture. In the intact SCN, cells are coupled by synaptic communication (e.g. VIP, AVP and GABA), as well as gap junctions and possibly other types of interactions (see Section 5.3). In addition, SCN cells receive synchronizing inputs, e.g. from the retina. Under these conditions, most SCN neurons are rhythmic with similar periods and adopt a defined phase relationship, with most cells in phase, but certain cells peaking early, late or in antiphase, allowing the SCN to produce differently timed output signals.

### 5.2. Network interactions

The studies discussed above indicate that many individual neurons can act as autonomous pacemakers in isolation, but are relatively inaccurate clocks. Additionally, in contrast to early evidence that electrical activity is not necessary for circadian rhythmicity, a recent study demonstrated that lengthy applications of TTX desynchronize molecular oscillations in individual neurons in SCN explants (Yamaguchi et al., 2003). In this investigation, as cells desynchronized, the amplitude of oscillations in clock gene expression dramatically decreased to near undetectable levels. These findings suggest that, in an SCN slice, intercellular communication is important for individual clock cells to sustain rhythms. Intriguingly, although the authors do not report whether this TTX treatment phase-shifts the rhythm (which could indicate that the clock had actually been ‘stopped’) they do show that after TTX washout individual cells resume their previous phase relationships so that ‘early’ cells show peak gene expression before ‘late’ cells. This important observation indicates that the phase relationships between SCN neurons in brain slices (and presumably in vivo) are a property of the network architecture.

Further studies have indicated that hyperpolarizing SCN neurons in culture or blocking Ca²⁺ channels dramatically attenuates/abolishes molecular oscillations (Lundkvist et al., 2005), indicating membrane potential and trans-membrane Ca²⁺-flux are essential components of the cellular clock. Severely attenuated molecular and behavioral rhythms have also been observed in transgenic fruit flies or mice with mutations that render clock cells hyperpolarized (Nitabach et al., 2002; Pakhotin et al., 2006). Therefore, in contrast to the traditional view of neuronal firing rate rhythms as an output or ‘hand’ of the clock, a more integral role for cellular electrical activity in the SCN pacemaking process has emerged.

An additional important observation of the Yamaguchi et al. study was that almost all SCN neurons (~99%) exhibited oscillations in Period gene expression. In contrast, firing rate rhythms are detected in only ~50% of neurons in dispersed cultures (Welsh et al., 1995; Liu et al., 1997b), ~70% of neurons in high density cultures (Aton et al., 2005) and ~90% of cells in acute brain slices (Brown et al., 2005). These data indicate that network interactions between SCN neurons may drive rhythms in some cells that are not be capable of acting as autonomous oscillators in isolation. An additional possibility is that some neurons may exhibit molecular oscillations but not rhythms in electrical activity or vice versa. It is currently unclear whether autonomous or ‘driven’ oscillating neurons or arrhythmic cells can be distinguished on the basis of their morphology or neurochemical phenotypes; however one study reports that calbindin containing cells in the hamster SCN (located in a region lacking rhythmic period gene expression: Hamada et al., 2001) do not express firing rate rhythms in vitro (Jobst and Allen, 2002).

### 5.3. Intercellular signaling and synchronization

An important role has emerged for communication between ‘autonomous’ SCN cellular oscillators to produce a coordinated circadian output. In recent years a number of studies have addressed which factors may synchronize rhythms in individual cells to achieve this aim. In this regard, traditional synaptic transmission has received the most attention with a number of studies now indicating its importance for cellular synchronization and circadian rhythmicity (Shirakawa et al., 2000; Honma et al., 2000; Yamaguchi et al., 2003; Noguchi and Watanabe, 2005).

Studies in cultured cells have demonstrated that rhythmic application of exogenous factors that are naturally abundant in the SCN, such as GABA, can synchronize the electrical
rhythms of individual clock cells (Liu and Reppert, 2000). Remarkably, GABA receptor antagonism does not appear to desynchronize SCN neurons in high density culture or organotypic slices and, in fact, increases firing rate rhythm amplitude in cultured cells (Aton et al., 2006). Despite these results, it seems likely that that many of the neurotransmitters and neuromodulators known to phase shift SCN rhythms (discussed above) play some role in synchronizing the activity of clock cells within these nuclei, possibly resulting in some level of redundancy.

One neuromodulator known to play an important role in synchronizing SCN cells is VIP (Fig. 6). Mice deficient in VIP or its VPAC₂ receptor exhibit impaired behavioral and SCN electrical rhythms, and individual cells from such animals in culture are less able to sustain rhythms and synchronize their activity patterns (Harmar et al., 2002; Colwell et al., 2003; Cutler et al., 2003; Aton et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2005, 2007; Maywood et al., 2006). In brain slices from animals that do not express the VPAC₂ receptor, cells are hyperpolarized (Pakhotin et al., 2006); however, depolarization or application of another endogenous SCN peptide, GRP, restores synchronous molecular and electrical oscillations to these neurons (Brown et al., 2005; Maywood et al., 2006). Further, studies on mice with deficient VIP-VPAC₂ receptor signaling provide evidence that endogenous GRP and PACAP transmission may partially compensate for the loss of VIP under certain circumstances (Brown et al., 2005, 2007). An additional pathway believed to be particularly important for synchrony and rhythmicity among SCN neurons involves Gi/o signaling (Aton et al., 2006). On the basis of their data, these authors propose a model whereby VIP-VPAC₂ signaling drives high daytime firing rates and an unknown Gi/o activator suppresses firing during the nighttime.

Neural inputs to the SCN are also certain to be important for synchronizing activity within the nuclei. For example, recordings from cells in the ventral SCN of rat brain slices demonstrate a TTX-sensitive rhythm in excitatory (glutamatergic) synaptic transmission that peaks during the day (Lundkvist et al., 2002). Such a rhythm could help synchronize SCN electrical oscillations to produce the characteristic midday firing rate peak. Further, this rhythm could indirectly drive or amplify the VIP-dependent, TTX-sensitive rhythm in inhibitory (GABAergic) activity that has been identified in the dorsal SCN, with a peak during the late projected day in vitro (Itri et al., 2004). GABAergic synapses in the SCN also exhibit rhythms in short-term plasticity, with 2 distinct forms of paired-pulse depression occurring at different times during the day but not at night (Gompf and Allen, 2004). Rhythms in synaptic activity such as these may thus enable the SCN cellular oscillators to maintain rhythms with synchronized periods but different phases based on the region of the SCN in which they are located. In support of this idea, physical proximity of SCN neurons is believed to at least partly predict phase-synchronization (Schaap et al., 2003; Aton et al., 2005; Brown et al., 2005, 2006).

In addition to classical synaptic transmission, a number of other forms of intercellular communication have been proposed to play important roles in cellular synchronization within the circadian clock which may explain the findings of Schwartz

et al. (1987) that TTX does not stop the SCN clock. One possibility is that in the presence of TTX, Ca²⁺ spikes allow some form of communication between SCN neurons. Such TTX-insensitive spikes have been observed previously in SCN cells (Thomson and West, 1990; Huang, 1993; Jackson et al., 2004). Another important method that SCN neurons may use to communicate in the absence of classical synaptic transmission is via gap junctions (Jiang et al., 1997b; Colwell, 2000; Jobst et al., 2004; Long et al., 2005). Gap junctions are present in many SCN neurons and appear to exhibit a functional rhythm such that cells are only coupled during the projected day when they exhibit synchronized electrical activity. Thus, gap junctions may help to synchronize SCN clock cells. Coordinated spiking in such coupled cells might then amplify other synchronizing signals (e.g. neurotransmitter release) that are output from such cells. Accordingly mice lacking the connexin36 protein that forms gap junctions in the SCN exhibit relatively disorganized circadian behavior in the absence of a synchronizing (light) input (Long et al., 2005).

Other non-synaptic forms of communication that could be important for intercellular communication include neuron–glia interactions (Tamada et al., 1998), changes in extracellular ion concentrations and ephaptic interactions between SCN neurons with apposing cell membranes (for review see van den Pol and Dudek, 1993).

Future work will need to determine the relative contributions of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and other forms of intercellular communication in the construction of a coordinated circadian output rhythm.

### 5.4. Phase heterogeneity

As alluded to above, while in the intact SCN individual cells must synchronize the periods of their free-running rhythms, it is clear that, with regard to the phase of such rhythms, these do not form a homogenous population. When large populations of SCN cells are recorded, such as in multiunit recordings (in vivo or in vitro) or discontinuous single-cell recordings in vitro (e.g. Inouye and Kawamura, 1979; Green and Gillette, 1982; Gribkoff et al., 1998) peak firing is consistently observed around the middle of the subjective day, in antiphase to the nocturnal animals behavioral activity. When progressively smaller populations of SCN cells are recorded for one or more circadian cycles in vitro the time of peak firing becomes more variable such that at the level of individual neurons SCN cells may peak ~12 h apart from one another (Schaap et al., 2003; Brown et al., 2006). These findings are similar to those obtained in studies monitoring the firing patterns or cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentrations of individual neurons in organotypic slices (Herzog et al., 1997; Ikeda et al., 2003). In the Ikeda et al. study, the Ca²⁺ concentrations recorded from neurons typically peaked ~4 h before the multiunit firing pattern of the slice and persisted in the presence of TTX and L-type Ca²⁺ channel blockers, indicating that the rhythms were not driven by cellular firing (Ikeda et al., 2003). Conversely, disruption of these rhythms, which appeared to result from Ca²⁺-release from ryanodine sensitive intracellular stores, reduced the amplitude
of multiunit firing rhythms suggesting that they may partially drive rhythms in action potential firing. The untested assumption of this study is that cells showing earlier peak calcium rhythms would also express earlier peak firing rhythms.

The phase-heterogeneity described above is also observed for the expression of *Per1* in SCN slices ([Quintero et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2003.08.045); [Yamaguchi et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2434994100)). Further, Quintero et al. demonstrate a positive correlation between *Per1* expression and firing frequency in SCN neurons during the projected day. These observations suggest that firing rate rhythms in SCN cells can be predictably related to the state of the molecular oscillator. However, since these authors do not measure spiking frequency in non-*Per1* expressing cells or across the whole circadian cycle, the predictive ability of this correlation is unclear. Indeed, it seems likely that the correlation reported by Quintero et al. relates only to a subset of SCN cells, since the most common peak time for *Per1* expression observed in this study was 8 h after lights on and numerous studies indicate that firing rate in SCN cells typically peaks ~6 h after lights on.

The significance of the widely-reported phase-heterogeneity exhibited by neurons in the SCN is only just beginning to be determined. However, one study suggests that the phase difference between SCN neurons may encode photoperiod in nocturnal rodents ([Vanderleest et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2007.03.016)), with SCN neurons in animals housed under long photoperiods presumably exhibiting a broader distribution of peak firing times than those housed under short photoperiods. In addition to encoding photoperiod, the phase-differences among SCN neurons likely relates to different functional groups within these nuclei. Indeed, based on their analysis of SCN outputs to neuroendocrine cells of the hypothalamus, [Kalsbeek et al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2006.02.008) postulate the existence of at least four phase groups of SCN neurons. Interestingly, Quintero et al. identify four groups of cells exhibiting differently timed peak *Per1* expression. Unfortunately, to date, reported sample sizes for single-cell firing rate recordings from SCN slices (a more direct measure of SCN output) are not large enough to ascertain whether similar phase groupings also exist in their electrical activity. The development of techniques that enable simultaneous, long-term, monitoring of firing and gene expression in individual neurons is, hence, a key goal in addressing how the electrical activity of SCN cells relates to the molecular oscillator.

### 6. SCN efferents and their possible influence on the neuroendocrine hypothalamus

Electrophysiological techniques have also been instrumental in characterizing the neural outputs of the SCN. Pioneering work by [Nishino et al. (1976)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0006-8993(76)80717-8) demonstrated that in the urethane anaesthetized rodent, visual stimulation or electrical stimulation of the SCN region reduced the electrical activity of cervical sympathetic nerves, whereas electrical stimulation of the ventromedial hypothalamus or lateral hypothalamus did not. This study provided evidence to support the contention that light acts on the SCN to influence the rate of pineal melatonin synthesis by modulating the level of excitability of cervical sympathetic nerves. At the time, the neuroanatomical connections of the SCN were poorly understood, and now it is known that the rodent SCN modulates the pineal via a polysynaptic pathway.

Electrical stimulation of the SCN has been used in vivo and in vitro to determine how SCN cellular activity might modulate the neuroendocrine hypothalamus. [Hermes and Renaud (1993)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(93)90466-8) demonstrated in the urethane anaesthetized rat that electrical stimulation of the SCN differentially alters the extracellularly recorded activity of parvocellular and magnocellular neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVNH). Specifically, they found that such stimulation antidromically suppressed the spontaneous activity of vasopressin/oxytocin magnocellular neurons projecting to the posterior pituitary, while parvocellular median eminence projecting neurons were mostly antidromically activated. Parvocellular neurons that project to the dorsal vagal complex were also mainly suppressed by electrical stimulation of the SCN. Neural tract tracing studies have failed to demonstrate a pronounced SCN innervation of the magnocellular neurons of the PVNH; however, the short latency of the inhibitions noted in this study suggests that a monosynaptic connection exists between these two structures.

Other investigations by [Hermes et al. (1996a,b)](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(95)02066-7) examined the electrophysiological and neurochemical connections between SCN and PVNH in vitro. Using intracellular and whole-cell patch-clamp recording techniques, they found that electrical stimulation of the SCN evoked short-latency inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) or a combination of IPSPs and excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in all PVNH neurons tested. The majority of type I magnocellular neurons demonstrated monosynaptic IPSPs which were blocked by the GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, bicuculline. The mixed IPSP/EPSP responses of type II and type III parvocellular neurons could be differentially modulated by GABA and ionotropic glutamate receptor antagonists. In the presence of bicuculline, the IPSP was blocked, and stimulating the SCN could evoke a monosynaptic dual-component EPSP. This dual component EPSP was blocked by a combination of NMDA and non-NMDA receptor antagonists. Chemical microstimulation of the SCN could also evoke increases in the frequency of transient EPSPs from these parvocellular PVNH neurons. These data suggest that SCN neurons projecting to the different regions of the PVNH modulate the activity of magnocellular and parvocellular neurons through GABAergic and glutamatergic mechanisms. Interestingly, a recent in vitro study demonstrated that unidentified neurons of the mouse PVNH expressed circadian rhythms in electrical activity that are dependent on the presence of the SCN ([Tousson and Meissl, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.peptides.2004.03.016)). When the SCN-containing regions of mouse brain slices were removed, the PVNH no longer expressed rhythmic electrical discharge. However, firing rate rhythms could be restored to PVNH neurons by placing SCN tissue in the same recording chamber and this rhythm promoting effect of the SCN could be blocked by an AVP receptor antagonist. These data suggest that AVP diffuses from SCN tissue grafts to promote rhythmic firing in the PVNH. However, in intact slices containing both the SCN and PVNH, AVP receptor antagonists do not prevent rhythms in the PVNH.

Thus, while the SCN can communicate temporal information by humoral signals, in the case of the PVNH, the neural connections from the clock have a more important influence on cellular activity in its target tissues.

Another recent study has used intact and cut SCN-containing slices to investigate the regulation of gonatotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons in the preoptic area ([Christian and Moenter, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yfrne.2007.03.004)). A surge in GnRH release is the trigger for ovulation and in nocturnal rodents this is timed to occur during the late day. Enhanced activity of the GnRH neurons is coincident with increased GABAergic input to these cells and this increase in GABAergic activity is attenuated in slices where a cut is placed between the SCN and preoptic area. Therefore, a GABAergic signal from the SCN may help time the enhanced activity of GnRH neurons, although VIP and AVP are also likely to play important roles in this mechanism (for review see [de la Iglesia and Schwartz, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2005.10.009)).

Antidromic mapping techniques have also been used to characterize the connections between the SCN and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SON). Dyball and coworkers demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the SCN in vivo altered the extracellularly recorded activity of the majority of SON neurons in the urethane anesthetized rat ([Cui et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(96)00826-8)). Most neurons showed a short latency suppression (58%) or activation (13%), while others showed a long latency response (24%). Vasopressin-containing neurons of the SON were mostly suppressed by SCN stimulation whereas oxytocin-containing neurons were either excited (20%) or suppressed (32%). Further studies indicated that the response of SON neurons to SCN stimulation varied with time of day so that the proportion of oxytocin cells showing excitatory responses and vasopressin cells showing inhibitory responses peaked around dusk ([Saeb-Parsy and Dyball, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.03.028)). When recorded in vitro using whole-cell patch-clamping techniques, currents evoked in SON cells following electrical stimulation of the SCN were blocked by bicuculline or non-NMDA antagonist, NBQX ([Cui et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(96)00826-8)). These data provide evidence to support the contention that a monosynaptic GABAergic and/or glutamatergic pathway from the SCN directly regulates the activity of SON neurons. Such a neural connection provides a mechanism by which the SCN clock can impose a circadian architecture on the synthesis and release of vasopressin and oxytocin from the SON ([Windle et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(92)90436-8)).

Further studies from Dyball’s group have characterized neural connections between the SCN and the ARC. Stimulation of the rat SCN in vivo induced responses in the majority of ARC neurons tested, with ~20% increasing firing rate, 20% decreasing firing rate and ~30% displaying complex responses with inhibitory and excitatory components ([Saeb-Parsy et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4522(00)00320-0)). Similar response profiles were observed both in neurosecretory cells and non-secretory cells, and suggest the existence of inhibitory and excitatory projections from the SCN to both types of ARC neurons. The existence of direct neural connections was confirmed by antidromic activation of SCN neurons by stimulating the ARC, suggesting a pathway by which the SCN may indirectly control growth hormone secretion via neurosecretory cells of the ARC. Of note, some ARC-projecting cells, which were most common in the peri-SCN region, also sent projections to the SON. Such SCN output neurons may, thus, be able to communicate temporal information to 2 (or more) brain nuclei simultaneously, perhaps enabling a finer degree of control over the temporal orchestration of a number of neuroendocrine and physiological parameters.

### 7. Summary

Electrophysiological recording techniques have had a profound impact on our understanding of SCN clock function. Such studies have been instrumental in determining the functional significance of SCN inputs and outputs and the neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, receptors and signal transduction mechanisms involved in such pathways (e.g. [Sun et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00369-3)). More recent research has begun to address cross-talk between the molecular oscillations within cells and ionic fluxes through the cell membrane, and has demonstrated an important role for SCN electrical activity, not only as an output, but as a component of the clock itself and as a vital mechanism that keeps individual cellular clocks in synchrony. The recent application of information theory to the study of SCN neurophysiology should yield further insight into how neuronal discharge conveys phase information to the rest of the brain (e.g. [Bhumbra and Dyball, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.03.028)). Future research on the circadian clock will need to further characterize the individual components of the multioscillator network and how they interact to keep time, through the coordinated activity of a diverse array of neurochemicals and other factors.
