**Alzheimer’s disease and Aβ toxicity: from top to bottom**

David H. Small, Su San Mok and Joel C. Bornstein

Evidence implicating the β-amyloid protein (Aβ) in the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease has steadily accumulated. However, the mechanism by which Aβ causes dementia is unknown. Here we argue that a more integrated, top-down approach to brain function is needed to assess the role of Aβ in Alzheimer's disease, and that more attention should be paid to the effects of Aβ on synaptic function rather than on cell death.

**Alzheimer’s disease** (AD) is a progressive neurological disorder that is characterized by memory loss and confusion. There is good evidence indicating that the accumulation of the β-amyloid protein (Aβ) is a primary event in the pathogenesis of AD. Aβ is a 4-kDa polypeptide derived by the proteolytic cleavage of the Aβ precursor protein (APP). The main form of Aβ contains 40 amino-acid residues. However, carboxy-terminally extended species that contain 42 or 43 residues ('long Aβ') are also produced. These long forms of Aβ aggregate more readily than the 40-amino-acid peptide. It is generally believed that aggregated Aβ is the agent that is responsible for disease progression, as the accumulation of aggregates is toxic to the brain. The fact that many familial AD mutations increase the production of long Aβ (REF.) provides strong support for this idea.

One of the central unanswered questions in AD is how Aβ accumulation in the brain causes cognitive decline. This question has generally been addressed by using the 'bottom-up' strategy. In other words, the direct biochemical effects of Aβ are examined *in vitro* with the hope that they will help us to elucidate the mechanism of neurotoxicity. This approach has led to the identification of numerous biochemical pathways and mechanisms that are modified by Aβ (FIG. 1). However, it has been difficult to determine which of these pathways are the most important in the onset of AD, and which should be targeted for the development of new therapeutic agents. It seems unlikely that all the biochemical effects of Aβ are associated with dementia and, in fact, it is not clear that cell death is the most relevant factor.

In this article, we argue that a more integrated approach to brain function is needed to assess the role of Aβ in AD. Specifically, we suggest that a 'top-down' approach derived from **computational neuroscience** can provide clues to identify biochemical pathways that are central to AD and worth targeting for therapy.

### A top-down approach

A key to understanding the actions of Aβ in AD is to determine how this protein affects the neuronal networks in which memories are stored, thereby causing dementia. This depends on an understanding of how stable memories form within a network, and how specific types of damage might lead to the amnesia that is typical of AD. This type of amnesia is characterized by difficulty in acquiring new memories, the sparing of established memories early in the disease, and the later, gradual loss of these memories.

The pioneering work of Hopfield showed that interconnected networks of model neurons can form associative memories if the strength of synaptic connections between these neurons changes as a result of prior activity. In these computational models, associative memories are coded by the strength of individual synaptic connections — the amplitudes of synaptic potentials — between different neurons, and are relatively insensitive to the loss of individual cells. Furthermore, individual neurons can be involved in several memories, a finding that has been confirmed in electrophysiological studies.

Networks of this type have been termed attractor neural networks. They learn because any given input pattern leads to a strengthening of specific synapses on some neurons in the network. If an input is repeated, the synaptic strengthening will ultimately impose a pattern of synaptic strengths onto the network, which ensures that inputs similar to the training input will produce the same output pattern. The network will be 'attracted' to a common output pattern for related inputs, so that part of a memory can be used to recall the whole, a characteristic of explicit memory that is specifically vulnerable in AD.

PERSPECTIVES

The properties of attractor neural networks can provide significant clues to potential sites of action for Aβ. For example, loss of both neurons and synapses are prominent features in post-mortem studies of AD. However, analyses of attractor networks that feature a loss of neurons and the consequent loss of synapses indicate that neuronal loss does not account, by itself, for the properties of the amnesia characteristic of AD. By contrast, a loss of synapses, without an associated loss of neurons, can account for all the features of AD, assuming that a mechanism that acts to keep the average firing of each neuron constant over time is also operating. Recent physiological studies have indicated that such a mechanism (synaptic scaling, see below) is widespread in the nervous system. The loss of synapses in AD is substantially greater than could be explained by the loss of neurons, which indicates that a deficit of synapses might be a primary problem in the early phases of AD. The implication of these studies is that the biochemical targets of Aβ leading to cell death (FIG. 1) could be less important for early treatment than those that produce selective toxic effects on synapses.

However, studies of attractor networks indicate that the dementia that is characteristic of AD might actually precede any overt loss of synapses or neurons. For example, studies of this sort indicate that synapse-specific changes in synaptic strength due to pre- or postsynaptic activity — such as long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) — cannot, by themselves, account for the formation of several stable memories within one network. This is because inputs that excite overlapping parts of the network will tend to be attracted to the 'strongest' pattern of synapses, strengthening it and swamping newer or weaker memories. Studies of attractor networks also indicate that synaptic scaling can compensate for this phenomenon, thereby allowing a network to store many stable memories. Synaptic scaling is a slower homeostatic mechanism by which the strength of all synaptic input to a neuron is regulated by the overall activity of that neuron over time. High levels of firing lead to all synapses on a neuron becoming weaker, whereas low levels of firing increase the strength of these synapses. These changes are independent of the synapse-specific mechanisms of LTP and LTD, and act by preventing already strong synapses from becoming even stronger. Synaptic scaling seems to result, at least in part, from the insertion and removal of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole

propionic acid (AMPA) subtype of glutamate receptor into subsynaptic membranes¹⁷⁻¹⁹. The expression of this class of receptor is indeed altered in AD²³, indicating that the mechanisms regulating synaptic scaling might be a target of Aβ in AD.

Computational studies have also pointed to a second mechanism by which the formation of memories within a network can be stabilized. This mechanism depends on the balance between LTP and LTD induced at different synapses on the same neuron by specific patterns of pre- and postsynaptic firing. Each time a neuron fires, there will be an increment of LTP at some synapses and LTD at others, keeping the overall strength of the inputs to the neuron relatively constant. However, computational studies indicate that, unless the ratio of these two processes is within a narrow range, the number of memories that can be stored within a network is severely limited and independent of the size of the network²⁰. So, these theoretical studies indicate that a selective change in either LTP or LTD, resulting from Aβ accumulation, would prevent the conversion of short-term memories into stable long-term memories—that is, anterograde amnesia. This would be seen, regardless of whether the process affected is enhanced or depressed by Aβ.

In addition to the biochemical pathways that mediate LTP and LTD²⁴⁻²⁶, the balance of LTP and LTD in neocortical and hippocampal pyramidal cells depends on two factors. First, the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity at individual synapses²⁷,²⁸, and second, the entry of Ca²⁺ during temporally associated dendritic action potentials and synaptic potentials. The timing of pre- and postsynaptic activity depends on dendritic action potentials evoked in the postsynaptic neuron by the generation of action potentials at the axon hillock²⁹. These have been identified in both *in vitro*²⁹ and *in vivo* studies³⁰. Electrophysiological analyses in neocortical slices indicate that, if a presynaptic action potential precedes a dendritic action potential by a few milliseconds, then LTP is induced at that synapse²⁷. If it trails a dendritic action potential by the same margin, then LTD is induced²⁷. This spike-timing-dependent plasticity can form a stable memory system²⁸,³¹, but anything that produces a change in dendritic length would upset this stability by altering timing. The Aβ deposits that are characteristic of AD

modify the shape and length of pyramidal cell dendrites<sup>32</sup>, and biophysically realistic simulations indicate that these changes are sufficient to modify the relative timing of pre- and postsynaptic action potentials<sup>32</sup>. So, computational studies indicate that the effects of Aβ on dendritic remodelling — a continuous process *in vivo*<sup>33</sup> — could be of considerable importance in AD.

The entry of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during temporally associated dendritic action potentials and synaptic potentials is a second key factor. This is crucial for the development of both LTP and LTD, and depends, in large part, on L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels<sup>29,34</sup>, which are presumed to be located on dendritic spines<sup>35</sup>. Aβ has been shown to stimulate this type of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel (FIGS 1 and 2), either by a direct action on the channel itself or through another receptor (such as the α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (*α7 nAChR*) — see below). So, disturbances in Ca<sup>2+</sup> handling in dendrites and spines could also be an important locus of Aβ action.

**How could Aβ influence plasticity?**

As discussed extensively by Arendt<sup>36</sup>, there is substantial evidence that Aβ has selective actions on synapses. Furthermore, Phinney *et al.*<sup>37</sup> have documented aberrant axonal sprouting and ectopic terminal formation in APP transgenic mice. Nevertheless, the mechanism by which Aβ affects synaptic plasticity remains a matter of conjecture. Neural computation studies indicate the type of physiological change that could cause AD-type amnesia, but they do not indicate which of these are most important *in vivo*. However, computational studies do point to a number of questions that can be tested experimentally. For example, what are the effects of Aβ on the balance between LTP and LTD in a single neuron? What effect does Aβ have on dendritic remodelling *in vivo*? What is the effect of Aβ on AMPA receptor recycling? These questions remain unanswered, and should be the focus of future research.

Not only do neural computation studies point to promising experiments, but they also indicate that certain known actions of Aβ might be important for the cognitive impairments in AD. For example, altering Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels on dendritic spines<sup>34,35</sup> would be expected to influence LTP<sup>29,34</sup> and dendritic remodelling<sup>38</sup> (FIG. 2). Several studies have shown that Aβ can promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type channels<sup>39–43</sup>, although the mechanism by which this occurs is still unknown. The extracellular-signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated pro-

β-Amyloid (Aβ) can alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in dendrites, either by binding directly to α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (α7 nAChRs), or by interacting directly or indirectly with L-type voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (L-VGCC). Increased intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> could influence long-term potentiation (LTP) or long-term depression (LTD) directly; alternatively, by activating extracellular-signal-regulated kinase/mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK/MAP kinase), it might affect LTP and LTD, and alter dendritic architecture through cytoskeletal remodelling. The numbers shown in the figure refer to the corresponding references in the bibliography. ACh, acetylcholine; AChE, acetylcholinesterase.

tein kinase (*ERK/MAP kinase*) cascade is also known to be an important signalling pathway for synaptic plasticity<sup>25</sup>, and increased ERK/MAP kinase is associated with tau phosphorylation and the cytoskeletal abnormalities found in dystrophic neurites in AD<sup>44</sup>. Recently, Aβ has been shown to activate the MAP kinase cascade in hippocampal neurons through the α7 nAChR<sup>45</sup>. Aβ binds very strongly to this receptor<sup>46–48</sup>, although the precise effect of the interaction between Aβ and α7 nAChRs might be complex<sup>49</sup>. For example, Aβ could partially block receptor activation, but it might also inhibit receptor desensitization<sup>49</sup> (FIG. 2). As nicotinic agonists protect neurons from Aβ-induced neurotoxicity<sup>50</sup>, the therapeutic effects of cholinesterase inhibitors in AD patients could be due to increased nicotinic receptor activation (FIG. 2).

**Testing the role of Aβ in AD**

Aβ undoubtedly has multiple effects on neurons. However, not all of these effects will contribute to the cognitive changes seen in

AD, and not all will be worthwhile targeting for therapy. The results of neural network studies provide insights into how memories can be stored, and give us important clues to the possible ways in which Aβ could act to deteriorate memory storage. Future studies should be aimed at testing the predictions generated by computational studies. Even though the discipline of computational neuroscience is still in its infancy, certain concepts are already clear. For example, theoretical studies show that the effects of Aβ on cognition are unlikely to be associated with cell loss. The theory also indicates that the best targets for therapeutic intervention are mechanisms that alter synaptic plasticity. Ultimately, however, the proof of any hypothesis concerning the role of Aβ in AD will rest on the therapeutic efficacy of drugs that specifically target the proposed mechanisms.
