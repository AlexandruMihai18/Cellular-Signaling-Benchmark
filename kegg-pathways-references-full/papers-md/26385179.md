**ABSTRACT**

Apelin-13, an adipokine, promotes cholesterol efflux in macrophages with antiatherosclerotic effect. Autophagy, an evolutionarily ancient response to cellular stress, has been involved in atherosclerosis. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate whether apelin-13 regulates macrophage foam cell cholesterol metabolism through autophagy, and also explore the underlying mechanisms. Here, we revealed that apelin-13 decreased lipid accumulation in THP-1 derived macrophages through markedly enhancing cholesterol efflux. Our study further demonstrated that apelin-13 induced autophagy via activation of Class III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and Beclin-1. Inhibition of Class III PI3K and Beclin-1 suppressed the stimulatory effects of apelin-13 on autophagy activity. The present study concluded that apelin-13 reduces lipid accumulation of foam cells by activating autophagy via Class III PI3K/Beclin-1 pathway. Therefore, our results provide brand new insight about apelin-13 inhibiting foam cell formation and highlight autophagy as a promising therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.

**1. Introduction**

Atherosclerosis is a chronic lipid metabolism disorder characterized by lipid accumulation within the arterial wall. Macrophages take up excessive modified lipoproteins, leading to the formation of foam cells, representing a hallmark of the atherosclerosis [1,2]. Therefore, to increase the clearance of arterial cholesterol deposits by macrophages is an attractive means to reverse plaque lipid buildup, especially enhancing macrophage reverse cholesterol transport (RCT). RCT involves the removal of cholesterol from peripheral macrophages and then transport to the liver for clearance into the bile and ultimately the feces, and has become a significant antiatherogenic strategy [3]. Our earlier studies have shown that cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells was increased by transforming growth factorβ1 (TGF-β1), growth differentiation factor-15 (GDF-15) and interleukin-27 (IL-27) increase, but

lysosomal acid lipase [15,16]. Thus, activation of autophagy can decrease, whereas inhibition of autophagy increases, the intracellular lipid deposits.

Apelin is an adipokine isolated from bovine stomach extracts, and has a protective effect against cardiovascular diseases including atherosclerosis [17,18]. Studies from our laboratory revealed that apelin-13, the predominant apelin isoform in circulatory system, inhibits macrophage foam cell formation by promoting the efflux of intracellular cholesterol [19]. In addition, emerging evidence suggests that autophagy participates in the protective effects of apelin in several cell types [20–22]. However, it remains unclear whether autophagy is involved in the atheroprotective effect of apelin on the foam cell formation. Therefore, the present study was designed to investigate whether apelin-13 promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells through activation of autophagy.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Reagents and antibodies

RPMI 1640 medium was obtained from Solarbio (Beijing, China). Fetal bovine serum (FBS) was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA). Cholesterol and phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate (PMA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St Louis, MO). Opti-MEM medium was from Gibco BRL (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Lipofectamine 2000 was from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). Rapamycin (10 nM) and 3-methyladenine (3-MA, 5 mM) were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). GFP-LC3-expressing plasmid (pEGFP-LC3) was from Cell Biolabs (San Diego, CA, USA). Antibodies against LC3, Beclin-1 and p62 were from Novus Biologicals (Littleton, CO, USA).

#### 2.2. Cell culture and foam cell formation evaluated by Oil red O staining

Human THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS, under a humidified atmosphere of 95% O₂ and 5% CO₂ at 37 °C. After 3–4 d, cells were treated with 160 nmol/L of PMA for 24 h to macrophage differentiation. The medium was then replaced with serum-free medium containing 50 μg/mL of ox-LDL for 48 h so that cells became fully differentiated foam cells for the subsequent experiments. Foam cells were stained with 0.5% Oil red O, and counterstained with hematoxylin, followed by photograph at × 400 magnification.

#### 2.3. Cellular cholesterol efflux determination

Cells were cultured as indicated above, followed by labeling with 0.2 μCi/mL of [³H] cholesterol. After 24 h, cells were washed with PBS and incubated with RPMI 1640 medium containing 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) overnight to allow equilibration of [³H] cholesterol in all cellular pools. The cells were then washed with PBS and incubated in 2 mL of efflux medium containing RPMI 1640 medium and 0.1% BSA. Medium- and cell-associated [³H] cholesterol was then measured by liquid scintillation counting. Percent efflux was calculated by the following equation: [total media counts/(total cellular counts + total media counts)] × 100%.

#### 2.4. Transfection of GFP-LC3 plasmid DNA and Beclin-1 siRNA

THP-1 cells were seeded on coverslips in 24-well plates overnight, and then 2 μg of purified recombinant plasmid, pEGFP-LC3, was transiently transfected into cells using Lipofectamine 2000 overnight in Opti-MEM medium following the manufacturer's instructions. Before cells were treated, THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% FBS. Coverslips were mounted on glass slides and all of the cellular images were obtained using fluorescence microscopy. For quantification of autophagic cells, GFP-LC3 punctate dots were determined from triplicates by counting a total of >60 cells at the end of the treatment. The siRNA transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 2000 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Silencing efficiency of Beclin-1 was measured by western blot analysis. The scrambled siRNA was used as negative control (con siRNA).

#### 2.5. Western blot analysis

Protein samples were obtained from the lysates of cultured cells, and the protein concentration was determined. Protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE, transferred to a PVDF membrane and blocked with TBS containing 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) and 5% nonfat milk powder for 2 h. The membranes were then incubated with appropriate primary antibodies overnight at 4 °C. After 3 washes with TBST, membranes were incubated with secondary antibodies for 2 h at room temperature. The protein samples were visualized using a chemiluminescence method (ECL Plus Western Blotting Detection System; Amersham Biosciences, Foster City, CA, USA).

#### 2.6. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assay

HPLC analysis was conducted as previously described [23,24]. Data were analyzed with Total Chrom software from PerkinElmer.

#### 2.7. Statistical analysis

Statistical analyses were conducted with the GraphPad Prism V.5.01 software. All data are presented as means ± S.D. Results were analyzed by using the One-way or two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). The significance level was defined as P < 0.05.

### 3. Results

#### 3.1. Apelin-13 promotes cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells

To examine the effect of apelin-13 on intracellular lipid accumulation, THP-1 macrophages were treated with ox-LDL for 24 h, and then incubated with apelin-13 in the presence or absence of pertussis toxin (PTX, which is an inhibitor for APJ of apelin receptor), followed by visualization of cholesterol accumulation in macrophages with Oil Red O staining. As shown in Fig. 1A, lipid droplets were significantly decreased in macrophages exposed to apelin-13, which effects were abolished by PTX.

To understand how apelin-13 decreased cellular cholesterol levels, the cholesterol efflux activities were assessed in the presence and absence of apelin-13. As shown in Fig. 1B, apelin-13 at the concentrations of 10 and 100 nM significantly increased the efflux of cholesterol. A time-course experiment revealed that 100 nM apelin-13 significantly increased cellular cholesterol efflux after 12 h incubation (Fig. 1C). Furthermore, PTX abolished the enhancement of cholesterol efflux induced by apelin-13 (Fig. 1D). Taken together, these results suggest that apelin-13 decreased cellular cholesterol levels through enhancing the cholesterol efflux.

#### 3.2. Apelin-13 induces autophagy in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells

To determine the effect of apelin-13 on autophagy activity, THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were incubated with apelin-13 for different time periods (0, 6, 12, or 24 h), or for 24 h with apelin-13 at different concentrations (0, 1, 10, 100 nM), followed by

Fig. 1. Apelin-13 ameliorates cholesterol accumulation through promotion of cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. (A) Effect of apelin-13 on intracellular lipid accumulation in macrophages. THP-1-derived macrophages were stained for lipids with Oil red O with and without the presence of ox-LDL (50 μg/ml), or ox-LDL with apelin-13 (100 nM) with and without PTX, respectively. Cells were viewed under a Nikon microscope (magnification × 400). (B) Concentration-dependent effects of apelin-13 on cholesterol efflux. THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells were incubated with different concentrations of apelin-13 for 24 h. Cholesterol efflux assay was then performed as described in Materials and Methods section. (C) Time-course effects of apelin-13 on cholesterol efflux. The experiment was performed as described in the legend to Fig. 1B except that the cells were incubated with 100 nM apelin-13 for different times as indicated. (D) Effects of apelin-13 on cholesterol efflux in case of PTX pretreatment. Foam cells were pretreated with PTX (100 ng/mL) for 12 h and incubated with 100 nM apelin-13 for 24 h. Cholesterol efflux assay was then performed as above. All the results are expressed as mean ± S.D. from three independent experiments, and each was performed in triplicate. *P < 0.05 vs. control, #P < 0.05 vs. apelin-13 group.

evaluating the changes of autophagy in apelin-treated THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells. As shown in Fig. 2, the exposure to apelin-13 increased the ratio of LC3II/LC3I in both time- and concentration-dependent manners. Moreover, a marked decrease in p62 was observed after treatment with apelin-13 (100 nM) for 24 h (Fig. 2A,B). Consistently, apelin-13 obviously enhanced autophagy, as manifested by the changes of LC3II/LC3I ratio and GFP-labeled autophagosomes (Fig. 2C,D). Taken together, these results show that apelin-13 induced autophagy in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells.

3.3. Apelin-13 enhances cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells via activating autophagy

Autophagic process may be related to cholesterol efflux from foam cells. We then assessed the relationship between autophagy and cholesterol efflux in the THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cell treated with and without apelin-13. The cholesterol efflux activities were assessed after manipulation of autophagic activities. As shown in Fig. 3, rapamycin, an inhibitor of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), induced autophagy as expected, enhanced apelin-13-induced autophagy. Whereas vinblazine, a microtubule depolymerizing agent that attenuated the effects of apelin-13, as manifested by the changes of LC3II/LC3I ratio and GFP-labeled autophagosomes (Fig. 5A,B). Consistently, both cholesterol efflux activity and total cholesterol quantification showed that rapamycin promoted cell cholesterol efflux apelin-13. Conversely, the inhibition of autophagy by vinblazine exerted the opposite effect (see Table 1). These results suggest that apelin-13 promotes cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells through autophagy pathway.

3.4. Activation of Class III PI3K/Beclin1 pathways is involved in apelin-13-induced autophagy in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells

To investigate the mechanism(s) underlying apelin-13-induced autophagy in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells, we examined the protein levels of the autophagy related signaling factors, such as Class III PI3K/Beclin-1, both of which are recognized as autophagic initiators that mediate nucleation of the pre-autophagosomal membrane. As shown in Fig. 4A, apelin-13 upregulated the expression of Beclin-1 and Class III PI3K. To further examine the role of autophagy in the protective effect of apelin-13 and confirm the role of autophagic machinery in the effect of apelin-13, siRNA was used to repress the expression of Beclin-1, which is essential for autophagosome generation. As shown in Fig. 4, silencing Beclin-1 markedly reduced the apelin-13-induced LC3-II accumulation and cholesterol efflux in THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells (Fig. 4C,D). Similarly, 3-MA, a Class III PI3K inhibitor, reversed the effect of apelin-13 (Fig. 4B,D). Taken together, these data demonstrate that the protective effect of apelin-13 against foam cell formation was via activating class III PI3K/Beclin-1-mediated autophagy.

been identified as an endogenous ligand for the orphaned G-protein-coupled receptor (APJ). Apelin and APJ constitute a ligand-receptor signaling pathway, which is widely present in various tissues, especially in the cardiovascular system. Increasing evidence suggests that the apelin/APJ pathway is a pivotal regulator of

cardiovascular functions [25–27]. Animal studies have demonstrated that apelin signaling can abrogate angiotensin II-induced atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E (apoE) knockout mice [17]. Epidemiological studies have clearly shown an inverse relationship of plasma apelin levels and the risk for coronary atherosclerotic

diseases [18,28,29]. Tasci et al. [30] found that plasma apelin levels were lower in patients with elevated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) compared with healthy controls. In addition, the decrease in LDL-cholesterol through statin treatment was accompanied with the increase of plasma apelin in dyslipidemia patients [31]. These findings suggest a potential antiatherogenic function of apelin, likely involving lipid metabolism. However, it is unclear how apelin exerts its effects. In the current study, we found that apelin-13 reduced cellular cholesterol levels via promoting cholesterol efflux in both time- and concentration-dependent manners. Moreover, these effects were abolished by PTX. These results indicate that apelin-13 decreased cellular cholesterol levels through enhancing the cholesterol efflux.

Many studies have shown that autophagy is activated in advanced (late stage) atherosclerotic plaques [32–34]. Moreover, it has recently been shown that autophagy is required for breaking down triglyceride into glycerol and free fatty acids in hepatocytes and adipocytes, and is also involved in cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam. Consistent with these findings, the present data from fluorescent and western blotting have confirmed that autophagy was induced in foam cells when treated with apelin-13 (Fig. 2). Furthermore, the activation of autophagy enhanced intracellular cholesterol efflux, while inhibition of autophagy blocked cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells (Fig. 3).

Autophagy, the conserved pathway that maintains cellular quality control, plays a potential role in regulating lipoprotein metabolism such as in obesity and atherosclerosis. Molecular mechanism studies of autophagy have revealed that autophagy is controlled and regulated by various molecules, such as ERK1/2, AMP kinase, Class I and Class III PI3K, Akt and mTOR [35]. Beclin-1 is a component of the Class III PI3K complex that is required for autophagy. Previous study showed that Beclin-1 functions by anchoring on trans-Golgi network (TGN) [36]. It has been reported that mitogen-activated protein kinase c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activate autophagy likely via increasing Beclin-1 expression [37].

To further determine the precise mechanism underlying apelin-regulated autophagy pathway during foam cell formation, we analyzed the expression levels of Class III PI3K and Beclin-1. As expected, apelin-13 remarkably increased Class III PI3K and Beclin-1 expression. Further analyses revealed that Beclin-1 silencing and treatment with 3-MA blocked autophagy pathway as shown by decreased levels of LC3II and increased p62 expression. Followed by

(D) The corresponding cholesterol efflux from lipid-loading macrophage foam cells was evaluated. (E) A model of the mechanism of apelin-induced autophagy and cellular cholesterol efflux. In THP-1 macrophage-derived foam cells apelin-13 could increase Class III PI3K and Beclin-1 expression, leading to autophagy. Consequently, cholesterol efflux is promoted.

the suppression of autophagy pathway, more lipid deposition was observed compared with those in control group, and accompanied by the reduced cholesterol efflux, suggesting that Class III PI3K/Beclin-1 was accounted for apelin-regulated autophagy and cholesterol efflux from foam cells. However, the accurate mechanism about how apelin-13 regulates Class III PI3K/Beclin-1-triggered autophagic pathway needs to be further investigated in the future.

In summary, our results suggest that apelin-13 promotes cholesterol efflux from macrophage foam cells by activating Class III PI3K/Beclin-1-mediated autophagic pathway, likely resulting in a delay in the pathological process of atherosclerosis. Accordingly, our results provide new insight about apelin-13 inhibition of foam cell formation and also highlight that autophagy may be a promising therapeutic target in atherosclerosis.
