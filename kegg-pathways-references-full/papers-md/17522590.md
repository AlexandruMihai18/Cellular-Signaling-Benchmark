Stressing the role of FoxO proteins in lifespan and disease

Armando van der Horst and Boudewijn M.T. Burgering

Abstract | Members of the class O of forkhead box transcription factors (FoxO) have important roles in metabolism, cellular proliferation, stress tolerance and probably lifespan. The activity of FoxOs is tightly regulated by post-translational modifications, including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation. Several of the enzymes that regulate the turnover of these post-translational modifications are shared between FoxO and p53. These regulatory enzymes affect FoxO and p53 function in an opposite manner. This shared yet opposing regulatory network between FoxOs and p53 may underlie a ‘trade-off’ between disease and lifespan.

14-3-3 proteins  
A family of ubiquitously expressed conserved regulatory molecules that can bind to functionally diverse signalling proteins, usually when they contain phosphorylated serine or threonine residues.

Acetylation  
Covalent binding of an acetyl moiety to the ε-amino groups of lysines and to the α-amino groups of N-terminal residues of proteins. Acetylation is catalysed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) such as CBP, p300 and P/CAF.

Ubiquitylation  
Covalent binding of the small protein ubiquitin to lysine or N-terminal residues of proteins, either as a tag for their rapid cellular degradation or to alter, for example, cellular localization. Ubiquitylation is catalysed by a series of enzymes: E1, E2 and E3 ligases.

The *Drosophila melanogaster* fork head (*fkh*) gene, the first identified member of the forkhead/winged helix class of transcription factors, was found to be essential for the proper formation of terminal structures of the embryo<sup>1</sup>. Until now, more than 100 members of this evolutionarily conserved transcription factor family have been identified, with roles in development, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, stress resistance and metabolism (reviewed in REF. 2). In mammals, the class O of forkhead box transcription factors (FoxO) consists of four members: FOXO1, FOXO3, FOXO4 and FOXO6. The DNA-binding domain of FoxO, in particular helix three, binds to the consensus motif 5′-TTGTTTAC-3′ (REF. 3). It seems that expression of FoxO-regulated genes can be controlled by any of the FoxO transcription factors, and that specificity is obtained either by their specific expression pattern or by isoform-specific regulation. Therefore, throughout this Review, we will use the general term FoxO, if not specified otherwise.

This conserved mechanism of signalling has led to the suggestion that FoxO, similar to DAF-16, may also affect lifespan in higher eukaryotes — some evidence for this has been obtained.

The activity of FoxOs is tightly controlled by post-translational modifications, including (besides AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation) non-AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation. Increased cellular oxidative stress regulates many of these FoxO post-translational modifications and, in turn, FoxO activity has been shown to regulate cellular oxidative-stress resistance. Hence, FoxO and oxidative stress appear to be intricately linked. This connection between oxidative stress and FoxOs is of particular interest with respect to a possible role for FoxOs in lifespan and disease, as ageing has been proposed to result from cumulative reactive oxygen-induced cellular and organismal damage<sup>14</sup>. Therefore, this Review focuses on the control of FoxO function by oxidative stress through post-translational modifications. Strikingly, it now becomes evident that oxidative-stress-induced post-translational modifications of FoxO are regulated by enzymes that also regulate the tumour suppressor p53. Consequently, we discuss the possible functional connection between FoxO and p53. Taken together, it is suggested that the functional connection between FoxO and p53 — and the shared regulation of FoxO and p53 — may underlie a trade-off between disease and lifespan.

The FoxO transcription factors are homologous to the *Caenorhabditis elegans* transcription factor DAF-16 (abnormal DAuer Formation-16), which regulates lifespan downstream of the C. *elegans* insulin receptor DAF-2 (REFS 4–6). Biochemical analysis in mammalian cells showed that FoxO transcriptional activity is also regulated by insulin and/or insulin-like growth factor (IGF) signalling through direct phosphorylation mediated by the serine–threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B (AKT/PKB)<sup>7–12</sup>. The AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO inhibits FoxO function by promoting its interaction with 14-3-3 proteins and its relocalization from the nucleus to the cytosol. Further studies in C. *elegans* and *D. melanogaster* revealed that the basic molecular pathway of insulin signalling to DAF-16/FoxO is identical among worms, flies and mammalian cells and, therefore, is conserved throughout evolution (BOX 1; reviewed in REF. 13).

Cellular functions of FoxO

Various cellular functions of insulin are mediated through insulin-mediated inhibition of FoxOs, which indicates that FoxOs constitute an important downstream target of the insulin-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT/PKB signalling pathway (BOX 1).

In mammalian cells, insulin binds to the insulin receptor (IR), which has intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. This binding results in activation of the IR and IR autophosphorylation on tyrosine residues. The activated IR then recruits adaptor proteins through its tyrosine phosphorylated residues (for example, the p46Shc and p52Shc proteins and the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1)). These adaptor proteins mediate the activation of downstream signalling events, such as the activation of the small GTPase Ras through the Shc proteins and the activation of the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) through IRS1. Activation of PI3K results in the formation of 3′-phosphorylated lipids (PI3Ps), which function as second messengers to activate downstream signalling. Through direct binding, these lipids participate in the activation of proteins that harbour PI3P lipid-binding domains.

Dephosphorylation of PI3P lipids is catalysed by several phosphatases, most importantly, the tumour-suppressor phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10 (PTEN). An important downstream component of PI3K signalling is the serine–threonine kinase AKT/protein kinase B (AKT/PKB). In addition to PI3P lipids, activation of AKT/PKB requires phosphorylation on a specific residue by the phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK1). AKT/PKB can phosphorylate a multitude of proteins with multiple cellular functions. Important substrates of AKT/PKB are the class O forkhead box transcription factors (FoxOs) and the tumour suppressor tuberous sclerosis-2 (TSC2). TSC2 functions in complex with TSC1, and the TSC1–TSC2 complex regulates p70S6 kinase activity through the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). Importantly, both FoxO and TSC2 are biochemically and genetically linked to PI3K–AKT/PKB signalling (see figure, right panel).

In model organisms, such as *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Caenorhabditis elegans*, insulin signalling has been deciphered genetically, which has revealed a common, evolutionarily conserved molecular outlay of signalling. In *C. elegans*, signalling to DAF-16 (the homologue of FoxO) proceeds through the same pathway (see figure, left panel), although the protein nomenclature is different to some extent: DAF-2 is the insulin/insulin growth factor-1 receptor homologue, AGE-1 is the homologue of PI3K and DAF-18 is the homologue of PTEN. Although not further elaborated on here, the pathway towards Ras–mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) and p70S6 kinase (at least in *D. melanogaster*) also appears to be conserved throughout evolution. GRB2, growth-factor-receptor bound-2; Rheb, Ras homologue enriched in brain; SOS, son-of-sevenless.

To scavenge the ensuing oxidative stress produced in peroxisomes and mitochondria, FoxOs upregulate several antioxidant enzymes such as catalase<sup>18</sup> and manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD)<sup>19</sup> (FIG. 1). This is further demonstrated by FoxO-mediated upregulation of the fatty acyl-CoA carriers sterol carrier protein-x (SCPx) and SCP2 (REF. 20), which probably protect unsaturated fatty acids from oxidative damage to ensure that they are properly processed. Besides the metabolic effects of insulin, FoxOs also oppose other insulin functions. Insulin–PI3K signalling stimulates cell-cycle progression and, in part, this relies on the loss of FoxO-induced cell-cycle inhibition through regulating factors such as p27<sup>Kip1</sup>, p130Rb2, cyclin D and cyclin G2 (REFS 21–24) (FIG. 1). Consequently, in the absence of insulin signalling, FoxOs induce cell-cycle arrest and entry into cellular quiescence<sup>21</sup>. Thus, FoxOs enable survival under fasting conditions by also inducing cell-cycle arrest and quiescence, which is reminiscent of the dauer switch that is induced by DAF-16 in *C. elegans*. In addition, FoxO increases insulin sensitivity by inducing expression of the insulin receptor and IRS2 (a member of the insulin receptor substrate family)<sup>25</sup>. This feedback control is likely to react rapidly to an increase in glucose levels or, in the case of *C. elegans*, to the availability of food.

AKT/PKB protects cells against apoptosis and, consequently, it was observed that enforced FoxO activity induces apoptosis through FoxO-mediated regulation of various pro-apoptotic genes, including Fas ligand, BIM and BCL-6 (REFS 8,26,27) (FIG. 1). This seems enigmatic given the possible role of FoxO in longevity. However, as discussed, FoxO adapts cells and organisms to food shortage and this adaptation should be timely. Hence, apoptosis by FoxO probably occurs only following inappropriately prolonged FoxO activation or in special cell types. In haematopoietic cells, cell-cycle inhibition by FoxOs is rapidly followed by apoptosis<sup>26</sup>. For haematopoietic cells within the periphery, this default apoptosis mechanism is essential because these cells are continuously replenished from the stem-cell compartment. Also, in cultured neuronal cells, forced FoxO expression induces apoptosis. However, neuronal cells are post-mitotic cells that consume vast amounts of oxygen and glucose. Studies on FoxO-induced apoptosis in neuronal cell culture systems therefore suggest that this energy consumption can only be sustained under conditions of insulin or growth factor signalling and cannot be supplied by FoxO activation.

Insulin functions as the prime regulator of glucose homeostasis by stimulating the uptake of glucose and its subsequent metabolism (glycolysis and glycogen synthesis). FoxOs regulate the gene expression of enzymes such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) and glucose-6-phosphatase, which are essential regulators of gluconeogenesis<sup>15,16</sup> (FIG. 1). In addition, FoxO can suppress the expression of genes that are involved in glycolysis, the pentose shunt and lipogenesis<sup>17</sup>. Therefore, FoxO activity induces a metabolic switch that is similar to low glucose and fasting conditions. To maintain sufficient ATP generation under these conditions, cells rely on fatty-acid breakdown and oxidative phosphorylation.

**Gluconeogenesis**
The process of making glucose from its own breakdown products or from the breakdown products of lipids or proteins.

**Catalase**
Haem-based enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide into oxygen and water.

**FoxOs in disease, lifespan and ageing**
Strikingly, under pathological conditions, FoxO activation often results in a phenotypically different outcome than under normal (disease-free) conditions. In diabetes, FoxOs decrease the levels of the homeodomain protein, pancreatic-duodenal homeobox factor-1 (PDX1), which results in decreased cellular insulin sensitivity<sup>28</sup>. This indicates that deregulation of FoxO activity could have a role in the development of diabetes. Indeed, deletion of one allele of *Foxo1* in diabetic mice reverses the diabetic phenotype of these animals, whereas hyperactive FOXO1 results in diabetes<sup>28</sup>.

these wild-type stem cells through increased proliferation in conjunction with high levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)³³. Taken together, these data can be summarized to suggest that normal stem cells require active FoxO to maintain ‘stemness’, and that ‘cancer stem cells’ need to inactivate FoxO to survive.

DAF-16 activity enhances stress resistance and prolongs lifespan in *C. elegans* and in *D. melanogaster* (reviewed in REF. 34). Lifespan and increased stress resistance are causally linked, and DAF-16-induced stress resistance depends on increased expression of MnSOD and catalase. In mammalian cells, FoxOs also regulate expression of MnSOD¹⁹ and catalase¹⁸. Although this evolutionary conservation does not by itself imply conserved function, accumulating evidence indicates that insulin and IGF signalling affects lifespan in mammals, probably including humans³⁴,³⁵. Consequently, because of the involvement of FoxOs in age-related diseases such as diabetes and cancer, and the possible role of FoxOs in enhancing lifespan, FoxOs may be involved in mediating a trade-off between lifespan and disease.

**Post-translational regulation of FoxO**

To better understand a possible role for FoxOs in lifespan and disease, it is important to understand the molecular details of FoxO regulation under various conditions. As mentioned earlier, FoxOs are subject to several post-translational modifications including phosphorylation, acetylation and ubiquitylation. These modifications regulate FoxO activity and have been reviewed extensively³⁶,³⁷ (FIG. 2). Here, we briefly discuss recent data on oxidative-stress-induced FoxO post-translational modifications and provide a model for FoxO regulation by oxidative stress that integrates the role of the different modifications.

**FoxO phosphorylation in response to cellular stress.** FoxO phosphorylation is induced by insulin signalling and increased cellular stress. In addition to AKT/PKB, the oxidative-stress-regulated mammalian sterile 20-like kinase-1 (MST1) was shown to bind and phosphorylate FoxO directly *in vitro* and *in vivo*³⁸ (FIG. 2a). MST1 phosphorylation activates FoxO *in vivo*, but how activation occurs is unclear. Surprisingly, MST1 phosphorylates FOXO3 directly on Ser207, which is located within the conserved third helix of the DNA-binding domain. This region contacts the bases that comprise the DNA recognition sequence for FoxOs — therefore, phosphorylation would be expected to weaken DNA binding because Ser207 faces the negatively charged phosphate backbone of the DNA.

MST1 also regulates the p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways³⁹ and, alternatively, MST1 regulation of FoxO might be mediated through JNK. Indeed, oxidative stress induces translocation of FoxO from the cytosol to the nucleus⁴⁰–⁴² and peroxide-activated JNK phosphorylates FOXO4 at sites that are important for FOXO4 activity⁴². Furthermore, in *C. elegans*⁴³ and *D. melanogaster*⁴⁴, JNK phosphorylates DAF-16 and dFOXO; JNK activity increases DAF-16-dependent and dFOXO-dependent stress resistance and, probably as a

Figure 1 | Transcriptional outputs of FoxO activity. Increased class O forkhead box transcription factor (FoxO) activity participates in several cellular processes, most notably inhibition of the cell cycle, regulation of cell death, protection from cellular (oxidative) stress and regulation of cellular metabolism (gluconeogenesis and fatty-acid oxidation). FoxO-regulated genes that are linked to these processes are indicated. The outcome of FoxO function is likely to be determined in conjunction with other genetic determinants, for example, the function of the tumour-suppressor protein p53.

Figure 2 | Summary of post-translational modifications on the various FoxO isoforms. The class O forkhead box transcription factor (FoxO) isoforms contain the following domains: forkhead domain (FKH — the DNA-binding domain), a nuclear localization signal (NLS), a nuclear export sequence (NES) and a transactivation domain (TA). Modified residues are indicated and amino-acid numbers are given for the individual isoforms. However, when a residue is conserved but no positive evidence for the modification has been obtained in other isoforms, the residue is not specified for those isoforms.

a | Phosphorylation events. The kinases that are responsible for the various phosphorylation events are shown above the schematic protein structure of FoxO. The hydrogen-peroxide-induced phosphorylation events as described by Brunet *et al.*<sup>41</sup> and the ERK- and p38-mediated phosphorylation events as described by Asada *et al.*<sup>127</sup> have been omitted for clarity.

b | Acetylation events. Acetylation of specific FoxO residues has only been studied for the cyclic-AMP responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and not for other histone acetyl transferases.

c | Ubiquitylation events. Two potential monoubiquitylation sites on FOXO4 are indicated. Unknown ubiquitylating or acetylating enzymes are indicated by question marks.

consequence, also increases the lifespan of these organisms in a DAF-16-dependent or dFOXO-dependent manner<sup>45</sup>. AKT/PKB-mediated phosphorylation of FoxO induces binding of 14-3-3 proteins and this correlates with inhibition of FoxO through nuclear exclusion. JNK-mediated MST1 regulation of FoxO would be consistent with the observed MST1-induced loss of 14-3-3 protein binding to FoxO because JNK has been shown to phosphorylate 14-3-3, which results in reduced 14-3-3 binding to partner proteins<sup>46</sup>.

The cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2) can also phosphorylate FoxO, but this modification seems to be FOXO1-specific (FIG. 2a). CDK2-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO1 inhibits FOXO1 activity and because CDK2 activity is inhibited by cellular stress (that is, DNA damage),

FOXO1 is transcriptionally activated after genotoxic stress<sup>47</sup>. Thus, both oxidative and genotoxic stress signalling seem to enhance FoxO activity.

Regulation of FoxO activity by acetylation. FoxOs can bind to several histone acetyltransferases (HATs) both *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>41,48</sup>. Oxidative stress enhances the HATs—FoxO interaction, which correlates with the observed increased acetylation of FoxO<sup>41,48,49</sup>. Acetylated residues within FoxOs have been determined by deletion mapping and mass-spectrometry approaches (FIG. 2b).

In *C. elegans*, increasing the dosage of the gene that encodes silent information regulator-2.1 (SIR-2.1), a histone and non-histone deacetylase, extends lifespan by 50% (REF. 50). A SIR-2.1-induced increase in lifespan is

inhibitor of HDACs) induces FoxO acetylation ${ }^{41,48,49,57,58}$ and affects FoxO localization ${ }^{57}$. In addition to this direct regulation, SIRT1 represses insulin secretion ${ }^{59}$ and the expression of IGF-binding protein-1 (IGFBP1), a negative regulator of FoxO activity ${ }^{60}$. Lifespan extension by SIR-2.1 also requires 14-3-3 proteins ${ }^{61,62}$. DAF-16 (FoxO) binds to 14-3-3, therefore SIR-2.1 (SIRT1) may physically bind to DAF-16 (FoxO) through 14-3-3. Consistent with this, heat-shock-induced SIR-2.1 binding to DAF-16 requires 14-3-3 (REF. 61).

The precise roles of acetylation and SIRT1 in FoxO regulation are unclear. Several studies suggest that acetylation inhibits and SIRT1 activates FoxO ${ }^{48,51,53,57,63}$, whereas others suggest that acetylation activates and SIRT1 inhibits FoxO ${ }^{49}$, or that acetylation and SIRT1 act on FoxO in a context-specific manner ${ }^{41}$. With respect to the latter, Brunet et al. ${ }^{41}$ proposed that SIRT1 inhibits the expression of FoxO-induced pro-apoptotic genes and stimulates the expression of FoxO-induced genes that are involved in cell-cycle regulation and stress resistance ${ }^{41}$. This model of differential FoxO gene regulation by SIRT1, and therefore acetylation, was named 'tipping the balance towards survival' ${ }^{64}$. The molecular mechanism that underlies this differential gene regulation is unknown and, because all studies on acetylation rely on gene regulation as a read-out of FoxO, these apparent discrepancies can also be due to the complex nature of gene regulation by acetylation (FIG. 3).

For example, in all studies, a direct effect of acetylation on FoxO has not been separated from the possibility that SIRT1 and HATs are recruited by FoxO to regions in which histone modifications occur to regulate transcription. Because histone acetylation usually results in gene activation, this will certainly obscure a possible inhibitory role of direct FoxO acetylation. In addition, the proposed differential effect of acetylation and SIRT1 in FoxO gene regulation may result from the differential reliance of target genes on the regulation of histone acetylation in order to be expressed, rather than acetylation of FoxO acting as a recruitment signal to specific promoters. Another confounding factor in assessing the direct role of acetylation on FoxO and SIRT1 is that acetylation also regulates FoxO cofactors. Notable examples are PGC-1α ${ }^{65,66}$, p300/CBP ${ }^{67}$ and possibly PPARγ ${ }^{68}$. Deacetylation of these cofactors also involves SIRT1 and the effect of SIRT1 on the activity of these cofactors appears to be context-dependent ${ }^{65-68}$. Thus, although at present most studies indicate that FoxO acetylation functions to repress FoxO activity, it is clear that more work is needed to elucidate conclusively the role of acetylation and SIRT1 on FoxO function.

Polyubiquitylation versus monoubiquitylation. Several studies have described polyubiquitylation and the subsequent proteasomal degradation of FoxOs ${ }^{69-71}$ (FIG. 2c). This polyubiquitylation can be induced by growth factors through PI3K-AKT/PKB signalling ${ }^{70,71}$ and possibly also through the IkB kinase (IKKβ) ${ }^{72}$. However, the kinetics of FoxO polyubiquitylation (detectable after ~12 h) as well as of protein degradation (half-life of ~8 h) ${ }^{70,71}$ were relatively slow compared with proteins such as p53

dependent on DAF-16 (REF. 50), which suggests that DAF-16 is regulated through acetylation either directly or indirectly. Mammalian FoxOs that are acetylated by HATs such as p300, the cyclic-AMP responsive element binding (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) and CBP-associated factor (P/CAF) are deacetylated *in vitro* and *in vivo* by the mammalian homologue of SIR-2.1, SIRT1 (REFS 41, 48, 49, 51–56). In addition to SIRT1, other histone deacetylases (HDACs) may regulate FoxO activity because the treatment of cells with TSA (trichostatin A, an

CBP can function as a co-activator of FoxO target genes through histone acetylation. **c** | Concomitantly, direct acetylation of FoxO by CBP can inhibit FoxO activity and therefore functions as a negative feedback signal. This negative feedback is counteracted by sirtuin (SIRT1), which deacetylates FoxO; this event results in prolonged promoter occupancy by FoxO. However, SIRT1 deacetylates histones and possibly also functions on CBP. The net effect of SIRT1 action is probably context-dependent and will be influenced by the kinetics of the various actions, the presence of other cofactors on the promoter region, and the role and relative importance of acetylation in the activation or repression of transcription through these cofactors. **d** | Acetylation of residues within the DNA-binding domain of FoxO weakens DNA binding and enhances negative regulatory phosphorylation (P) at the AKT/protein kinase B (PKB) site located within the nuclear localization signal (NLS).

Such acetylations may function as an additional inhibitory mark by preventing the binding of importins to the NLS and thereby preventing re-entry into the nucleus after FoxO has shuttled to the cytosol. **e** | FoxOs phosphorylated at the AKT/PKB residues bind to 14-3-3, which correlates with nuclear export of FoxO.

Figure 4 | An integrated model for FoxO activity control through stress-induced post-translational modifications. Following increased cellular oxidative stress (for example, by hydrogen peroxide treatment of cells) class O forkhead box transcription factors (FoxOs) translocate from the cytosol to the nucleus. This process correlates with c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)-mediated phosphorylation (residues Thr447 and Thr451 in FOXO4) and monoubiquitylation of FoxO. The cellular location at which these modifications occur is not known but two possibilities are indicated: in the cytosol (a) or in the nucleus (b). Monoubiquitylation might occur in either location but the identity of the E3 ligase is unknown. Phosphorylation of FoxOs by JNK probably mediates interaction with the basal transcription machinery and JNK phosphorylation may occur in the nucleus because active JNK relocalizes to the nucleus. Furthermore, monoubiquitylation might strengthen FoxO function at the promoter and prevent subsequent acetylation. Inhibition of FoxO can proceed through multiple pathways: polyubiquitylation and degradation (c); deubiquitylation and relocation (d); and deubiquitylation followed by acetylation (e). These modes of FoxO (in)activation allow adaptation to subsequent challenges of stress, for example, by stress-induced sirtuin (SIRT1)-mediated deacetylation within the nucleus — FoxO is then immediately available to increase gene transcription, whereas polyubiquitylation and degradation dampen a subsequent FoxO response.

and p27kip1 that are regulated primarily by degradation (half-lives of less than 1 h73,74). Therefore, polyubiquitylation of FoxO may be a constitutive, slow process. The F-box protein SKP2 has been identified as the putative E3 ubiquitin ligase that polyubiquitylates FoxOs69 (FIG. 2c). Platelet-derived growth factor treatment induced a strong reduction in FOXO1 half-life (<1 h) in chicken embryo fibroblasts that were transformed through overexpression of activated forms of PI3K or AKT/PKB75. This reduction is probably due to increased expression of SKP2 in these transformed cells because the loss of PTEN (and therefore activation of AKT/PKB) enhances the expression of SKP2 (REF. 76). This result also suggests that, in contrast to normal cells, cells transformed through increased PI3K signalling inhibit FoxO function through AKT/PKB activation and increased degradation.

Besides polyubiquitylation, FoxOs are also subject to monoubiquitylation (FIG. 4), which is induced shortly (~5 min) after exposure of cells to oxidative stress77. Monoubiquitylation of FoxO induces its nuclear localization and stimulates FoxO transcriptional activity; however, the mechanism that mediates this nuclear localization is unclear. Nuclear localization could result from monoubiquitylation stimulating FoxO nuclear import or, alternatively, from monoubiquitylation increasing cofactor

Monoubiquitylation strongly increases FoxO transcriptional activity and therefore monoubiquitylated FoxO might represent the fully active form of FoxO. Within the nucleus, FoxOs can be deubiquitylated by USP7. Further inhibition of FoxO activity can subsequently occur through relocalization to the cytosol, polyubiquitylation and/or acetylation. Acetylation inhibits FoxO function by interfering with DNA binding<sup>58</sup> and/or by preventing renewed monoubiquitylation. The kinetics of monoubiquitylation (fast and transient) and acetylation (slow) are compatible with a model in which acetylation competes with monoubiquitylation. In this model, SIRT1-mediated deacetylation makes FoxO available for renewed activation. Alternatively, acetylation and SIRT1 may determine the gene specificity of FoxO as previously proposed<sup>41</sup>.

Insulin signalling and oxidative-stress signalling towards FoxO intertwines in various ways. For example, insulin enhances p300-mediated acetylation of FOXO1<sup>55</sup>. The kinetics of insulin-induced and stress-induced acetylation appear to differ: insulin induces a fast (5 min) and transient increase, whereas stress-induced acetylation occurs relatively slowly (60 min). These kinetics are compatible with several other observations. For example, acetylation of Lys242, Lys245 and Lys262 of FOXO1 has been shown to weaken DNA binding *in vitro*, whereas these modifications result in increased insulin-induced Ser253 phosphorylation *in vivo*, which is involved in 14-3-3 binding and nuclear exclusion<sup>58</sup>. Consistent with regulation of DNA binding and, possibly, specific gene locations by acetylation, SIRT1 expression has been suggested to function as a nuclear trap for FOXO1 at certain chromosomal microdomains to promote the expression of glucogenic genes<sup>57</sup>. Thus, because acetylation and ubiquitylation target the same amino-acid residues, rapid insulin-induced acetylation may prevent or counteract the rapid induction of monoubiquitylation following oxidative stress. Indeed, in FOXO4, Lys199 and Lys211 can be acetylated and ubiquitylated<sup>77</sup>, which suggests that competition between different lysine modifications can occur.

JNK may regulate FoxO at multiple levels. JNK phosphorylation sites that have been identified for FOXO4 (Thr447 and Thr451) are located within the transactivation domain. Thus, JNK-mediated phosphorylation of these residues may contribute to FoxO interactions with the basal transcription machinery (for example, mediator–RNA polymerase II). JNK can also mediate the interaction between insulin and oxidative-stress signalling. AKT/PKB phosphorylation of FoxO induces FoxO binding to 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent nuclear export, whereas JNK has been shown to phosphorylate 14-3-3, thereby causing its release from binding partners such as FoxO<sup>46,79</sup>. JNK activation has also been shown to impair insulin-induced AKT/PKB activation through phosphorylation of IRS1 at Ser307 (REF. 80). Taken together, these findings suggest that JNK regulates FoxO activity at multiple levels and this underscores the importance of JNK in opposing insulin signalling towards FoxO. Thus, insulin and oxidative stress balance FoxO function probably through multiple mechanisms and the outcome of the opposing actions will be highly context-dependent.


FoxO and p53, brothers in arms

As outlined in the first part of this Review, FoxOs coordinate cell-cycle arrest, cell death and cellular oxidative stress to maintain metabolic stability. In general, lack of insulin, low glucose or increased cellular oxidative stress result in FoxO-mediated arrest in G1–G0, increased gluconeogenesis and protection against cellular oxidative stress. This enables mammalian cells or organisms such as *C. elegans* to survive periods of food shortage. The tumour suppressor p53 also coordinates cell-cycle arrest and cell death to enable DNA repair and to maintain genomic stability. Genotoxic stress activates p53 and enables p53-dependent cell-cycle arrest followed by DNA repair or, in the case of extensive damage, p53-induced cell death. Therefore, FoxO and p53 both function to coordinate cell-cycle progression and cell death to ensure metabolic and genomic stability, respectively. In addition, evidence reviewed below further strengthens the similarity between FoxO and p53, including a role in lifespan. Finally, as will be discussed here, mechanisms that regulate the post-translational modifications of FoxO and p53 are shared.

The cellular response to FoxO and p53 activation. The cellular responses to FoxO and p53 activation are highly similar: both induce either cell-cycle arrest or apoptosis depending on cell type and condition (that is, the level of cellular stress). Similar mechanism(s) mediate these cellular responses. Cell-cycle arrest by FoxO primarily occurs through the regulation of p27<sup>Kip1</sup> (REF. 23) and, in the case of p53, through p21<sup>Cip1</sup> (REF. 81). Both p27<sup>Kip1</sup> and p21<sup>Cip1</sup> are cell-cycle inhibitors that bind to and inhibit cyclin–CDK complexes, the activation of which is necessary for cell-cycle progression. Apoptosis by FoxO and p53 proceeds through multiple mechanisms but favours the upregulation of BH3-only proteins, such as BIM in the case of FoxO<sup>26</sup> and PUMA in the case of p53 (REFS 82,83).

Stress regulation. FoxO and p53 are both regulated by cellular stress, albeit probably by different types of stress. Because the primary role of DAF-16 and FoxO proteins is to ensure metabolic stability under conditions of food shortage, the main regulator of FoxO is probably metabolic or oxidative stress. By contrast, p53 is primarily regulated by genotoxic stress. This difference between FoxO and p53 will certainly not be absolute, but is probably relevant under endogenous (mild) stress conditions. Under more extreme conditions this difference may be lost; for example, exogenous DNA-damaging agents might increase sufficient levels of oxidative stress to regulate FoxOs. In addition, DNA damage at levels that cause cell death can abrogate the CDK2-mediated inhibitory phosphorylation of FOXO1<sup>47</sup> (see above). Also, hydrogen peroxide may inflict considerable DNA damage and thus directly or indirectly regulate p53. Finally, the nature of the oxidative stress may differ under different conditions. UV radiation, for example, induces oxidative stress that consists mostly of singlet oxygen<sup>84</sup>, whereas metabolic stress generates, at least initially, mostly superoxide and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, under endogenous stress conditions FoxO and p53 mediate a similar response, albeit induced by different stress signals.

Both FoxO and p53 decrease cellular oxidative stress; however, the mechanisms by which p53 functions are not fully understood<sup>85</sup>. Similar to FoxO, p53 has been shown to regulate MnSOD. Some reports show that p53 represses MnSOD expression and, accordingly, increased MnSOD expression has been observed in p53-deficient cells<sup>86,87</sup>. By contrast, upregulation of MnSOD by p53 has also been reported<sup>88</sup>. Furthermore, p53 has been shown to bind directly to MnSOD and thereby impair MnSOD function<sup>89</sup>. Although p53 appears to regulate MnSOD function, the overall effect of p53 on oxidative-stress resistance is unclear.

FoxO, p53 and glucose metabolism. The ability of both p53 and FoxO to resolve stress is highly dependent on their ability to regulate cellular metabolism. The ability of FoxO to enable resistance against glucose starvation (food shortage) requires a shift from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis and the use of fatty acids and/or oxidative phosphorylation. Recent results have also highlighted a role for p53 in controlling glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Wild-type p53 decreases glycolytic rate by transcriptional downregulation of phosphoglycerate mutase<sup>90</sup> and upregulation of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR)<sup>91</sup>, a protein with similarity to the phosphatase domain of the bifunctional enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase–fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase. Expression of TIGAR lowers fructose-2,6-bisphosphate levels in cells, which in turn lowers the glycolytic rate. p53 has also been shown to regulate the expression of SCO2 (REFS 92,93), a protein that is required for the assembly of cytochrome c oxidase, which is a multimeric protein complex that is required for oxidative phosphorylation. Therefore, p53 and FoxO both suppress glycolysis and differentially regulate mitochondrial function.

Strikingly, in tumorigenesis, both the loss of p53 and the inhibition of FoxO allows for compromised aerobic respiration and increased glycolytic rate. This metabolic shift probably contributes to the Warburg effect observed in tumours, but it may also contribute to the loss of p53-mediated escape of replicative senescence<sup>90</sup>. Taken together, it is clear that the ability of FoxO and p53 to enable cell survival under stress conditions relies on their ability to regulate cellular glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation.

The interplay between p53 and FoxO. There is accumulating evidence that regulators of FoxO function are controlled by p53. For example, p53 upregulates the expression of serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase (SGK), a negative regulator of FoxO<sup>94,95</sup> and PTEN<sup>96</sup>, whereas it represses expression of PIK3CA (which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K)<sup>97</sup>. Increased PTEN expression and reduced PI3K activity will both result in FoxO activation by p53. Although these observations are in apparent contrast, they do at least suggest that p53 can regulate FoxO function through gene expression. The outcome (inhibition or activation) is likely to be context-dependent.

Some reports suggest that FoxO and p53 function in concert. FoxO target genes (for example, Fas ligand<sup>98</sup>, p21<sup>cip1</sup> (REFS 81,99) and GADD45 (REFS 100,101)) can also

factors (FoxO) and tumour-suppressor protein p53 are

opposing functions (the deubiquitylating enzyme USP7

(JNK), which has an identical action on FoxO and p53.  
This scheme shows that following a change in the activity

be regulated by p53 and, following nutrient deprivation,  
FoxO regulates expression of SIRT1 in a p53-dependent  
manner<sup>102</sup>. Also, co-immunoprecipitation of p53 and  
FoxO after treatment of cells with hydrogen peroxide has  
been reported<sup>41</sup>. However, the interaction of FoxO with  
p53 might be cell-type-dependent and/or dependent  
on the type of stress stimulus. Furthermore, the sharing  
of target genes by FoxO and p53 does not necessarily  
imply co-regulation but might simply reflect the requirement  
of specific gene induction during a similar cellular  
response.

A new perspective on the interplay between FoxO  
and p53 is derived from recent studies, which indicate  
that FoxO and p53 use a similar, if not identical, set of  
modifying enzymes to regulate their function after stress  
(FIG. 5). JNK<sup>42,103</sup>, SIRT1 (REFS 41,48,49,104,105) and USP7  
(REFS 77,106) have been shown to regulate both p53 and  
FoxO. However, these modifying enzymes have, in part,  
opposing effects on p53 and FoxO function. USP7 binds  
to both p53 and FoxO. However, deubiquitylation of p53  
results in p53 stabilization and activation<sup>106</sup>, whereas  
deubiquitylation of FoxO by USP7 inhibits FoxO function<sup>77</sup>.  
Furthermore, monoubiquitylation of p53 has been suggested  
to increase nuclear export<sup>107</sup>, but monoubiquitylation  
of FoxO correlates with nuclear localization<sup>77</sup>. USP7  
regulates nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of FoxO and p53, but  
in opposing ways.

SIRT1 also binds to both FoxO and p53. Deacetylation  
by SIRT1 inhibits p53 function<sup>104,105</sup>, whereas it seems to  
activate FoxO activity (as discussed above). Finally, stress-  
induced JNK activation results in phosphorylation of p53  
at Thr81 and this results in p53 stabilization and activation<sup>108,109</sup>. JNK activation also results in activation of FoxO.  
Therefore, JNK appears to stimulate both FoxO and p53  
function in stressed cells.

FoxO, p53 and ageing. The similarities between FoxO  
and p53 may also extend to their role in regulating lifespan,  
although the contribution of FoxO and p53 is likely to be  
organism-dependent. Short-lived organisms, especially

organisms with limited mobility such as *C. elegans*, greatly rely on the regulation of metabolic stress to survive food shortage. Except for cells of the reproductive system, genotoxic stress will have a limited impact on short-lived animals because the soma consists of only post-mitotic cells or because the lifespan is too short to acquire diseases such as cancer. Consequently, FoxO functions as the main regulator of lifespan in these short-lived organisms. By contrast, organisms with a longer lifespan and a soma with considerable numbers of cells with proliferative capacity will require extensive genotoxic stress resistance for survival and the prevention of cancer. The relative importance of metabolic stress resistance, and hence FoxO, for survival and lifespan in long-lived organisms is therefore more dependent on secondary factors such as mobility or, for example, the ability to use multiple food resources.

Consequently, in longer-lived organisms, a clear effect of p53 on lifespan may be expected. Transgenic mice that carry a p53-mutant allele rendering p53 (hyper)active show accelerated ageing and shortened lifespan$^{110}$, whereas mice that carry supernumerary copies of wild-type p53, named ‘super p53’ mice or *Mdm2*-haploinsufficient mice, have enhanced tumour suppression but no signs of premature ageing$^{111}$. Perhaps even more strikingly, these mice have not been reported to have an extended lifespan. These results may, in fact, be similar to the paradoxical observations from genetic studies in humans. In humans, a codon 72 polymorphism of p53 exists (encoding Pro instead of Arg) and carriers of the *TP53* codon 72 Pro–Pro genotype have an increased cancer risk compared to Arg–Arg carriers. Surprisingly, in people aged >85 years, the Pro–Pro genotype is associated with increased survival, despite an increased proportional mortality from cancer$^{112}$. Taken together, these studies in mice and humans suggest that p53 protects against cancer but at a certain cost of longevity. This ‘cost of longevity’ is, at least in mice, apparently reduced if p53 remains under normal regulatory control.

### Ageing: the FoxO–p53 paradigm

The studies discussed above indicate the importance of the regulatory proteins that control p53 and FoxO function in a trade-off between lifespan and cancer. p53 and FoxO share several of these regulatory proteins, namely SIRT1, USP7 and JNK. The observation that the same post-translational modifications have opposite effects on FoxOs and p53 activity could indicate that an increase in lifespan caused by regulation of FoxO function (for example, through modulating USP7 activity) would always be counterbalanced by a concomitant reduction in p53 function and, therefore, an increased probability of developing cancer. Alternatively, increased p53 function through USP7 and improved protection against cancer would be balanced by a shorter lifespan because of reduced FoxO function. This opposing control of FoxO and p53 function by SIRT1 and USP7 might underlie an intricate trade-off between lifespan and cancer. This model is also supported by observations that SIRT1 can function as an oncogene$^{113-115}$, and USP7 has been proposed to be a tumour suppressor$^{116,117}$.

However, as indicated in FIG. 5 and discussed above, JNK activity enhances both FoxO and p53 function. Increasing JNK activity would enhance both lifespan and protection against cancer and would provide an opportunity to circumvent a FoxO–p53-mediated trade-off between lifespan and cancer. Unfortunately, enhanced JNK activity is strongly implicated at the onset of type II diabetes (reviewed in REFS 118,119). Although in this scheme JNK does not mediate a trade-off between lifespan and cancer, it is clear that JNK can function as a pivot that links lifespan and diabetes. Furthermore, JNK itself mediates the response to oxidative stress, whereas SIRT1 and USP7 function after oxidative stress. JNK might function as a ‘gatekeeper’ in funnelling stress towards either FoxO or p53 to influence survival or death. Indeed, although JNK is generally considered to be a pro-apoptotic signal, it can equally function as a survival signal$^{120}$.

At present, the only intervention that has consistently been shown to slow the rate of ageing and to increase mean and maximum lifespan in short-lived species is caloric restriction. Caloric restriction provides a multitude of health benefits, including a reduction in cancer incidence and, therefore, the mechanism that underlies caloric restriction may represent a means to circumvent the potential trade-off between lifespan and disease. SIR-2.1 (SIRT1 in mammals) is thought to be an important mediator of caloric restriction and, as such, this would be at odds with the model outlined above. In addition, several questions remain unanswered. What is the mechanism for SIR-2.1 (SIRT1)-mediated caloric restriction? Does this mechanism involve DAF-16 (FoxO) and/or p53 (REF. 121)? Will caloric restriction increase lifespan in humans to the same extent as it increases lifespan in short-lived species$^{122-124}$? Caloric restriction provides clear health benefits; however, there are also health concerns associated with it, including hypotension, lowered body temperature, infertility, osteoporosis and, especially in humans, mental depression$^{125}$. Similar to the observations made for p53, caloric restriction provides health benefits, but it may not result in a clear increase in lifespan in long-lived species such as humans.

The free-radical theory of ageing postulates a direct causal relationship between ageing and the accumulation of damage caused by reactive oxygen species$^{126}$. The role of DAF-16 and FoxO in lifespan regulation and the control of cellular oxidative stress apparently corroborates this theory. In addition, excessive oxidative stress through cellular damage can contribute or may even cause many age-related diseases such as cancer and diabetes. Our increasing knowledge regarding the regulation of important factors in lifespan and disease such as FoxO and p53 in the context of cellular oxidative stress may provide frameworks for understanding the intricate relationship between lifespan and disease. Key to this understanding may be the nature of the regulatory circuits that are shared by FoxO and p53, and their role in regulating FoxO and p53 activity. We propose that the post-translational modification regulating enzymes shared between FoxO and p53 underlie a FoxO–p53 mediated trade-off between lifespan and disease. In this respect, it will be of interest to learn whether this system of mutual dependence on

regulatory factors extends from FoxO and p53 to other important regulators of cell death and cell-cycle progression such as c-Myc.

Understanding the connections between the important determinants of lifespan and disease may help to find ways to postpone the onset of these diseases without adverse effects on lifespan. Finally, on this note, further studies into the role of these modifying enzymes and the possible identification of novel shared interactions between p53 and FoxO may aid in the search for a means to uncouple lifespan and disease. Whether this will result in any intervention that can promise the ‘fountain of youth’ is an open question, but then again, “who wants to live forever”?
