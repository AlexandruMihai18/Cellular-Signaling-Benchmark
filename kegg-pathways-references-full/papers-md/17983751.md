Salmonella enterica are facultative intracellular bacteria that cause intestinal and systemic diseases, and replicate within host cells in a membrane-bound compartment, the Salmonella-containing vacuole. Intravacuolar bacterial replication depends on spatiotemporal regulated interactions with host cell vesicular compartments. Recent studies have shown that type III secretion effector proteins control both the vacuolar membrane dynamics and intracellular positioning of bacterial vacuoles. The functions of these effectors, which are beginning to be understood, disclose a complex hijacking of host cell microtubule motors—kinesins and dynein—and regulators of their function, and suggest interactions with the Golgi complex. Here, we discuss current models describing the mode of action of Salmonella type III secretion effector proteins involved in these processes.

Vacuolated intracellular pathogens Several intracellular bacterial pathogens, such as Salmonella, Legionella, Mycobacterium, Chlamydia and Brucella, replicate within host cells in a membrane-bound vacuole. These vacuolated pathogens not only must avoid or resist antimicrobial mechanisms of the host cell, such as phago-lysosomal fusion, but also need to establish a replicative niche where they can acquire the nutrients and membrane needed to enclose replicative bacteria. The latter is achieved through interactions, modulated by bacterial virulence proteins, with specific host cell organelles and vesicular compartments, but the mechanisms involved are generally poorly understood. However, recent work on Salmonella has identified several bacterial effectors that are implicated in the regulation of membrane dynamics of Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs) and control of their spatial distribution. Here, we review current knowledge of their underlying molecular mechanisms, which reveal complex interactions between Salmonella virulence proteins and host molecules.

Salmonella infections Salmonella enterica serovars are a group of Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacteria that infect a wide variety of animals. Salmonella infections are common in humans, causing typhoid fever and gastrointestinal diseases, and are an important public health concern worldwide [1]. Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium), which is a leading cause of human gastroenteritis, has been extensively used to study the molecular and cellular mechanisms of Salmonella virulence, because of the availability of sophisticated genetic tools and of suitable animal models for human typhoid and intestinal inflammation [2,3].

Type III secretion systems The virulence traits of S. enterica include two type III secretion systems (T3SSs), encoded in distinct regions of the chromosome within Salmonella pathogenicity island-1 and -2 (SPI-1 and SPI-2, respectively) [4–6]. T3SSs are used by many Gram-negative bacteria to deliver effector proteins into the eukaryotic host cell cytosol or membranes [7]. The effectors often mimic eukaryotic proteins, acting on diverse host cell processes to benefit the bacterium. The SPI-1 T3SS is activated extracellularly and promotes invasion of gut epithelial cells and inflammation [3,8]. The SPI-2 T3SS is activated inside host cells, is essential for systemic infection of mice [9], and has a role in intestinal inflammation [3]. Furthermore, SPI-2 effectors translocated across the SCV membrane mediate intracellular replication of Salmonella in a variety of cell types, including macrophages and epithelial cells [5,6]. However, it has become increasingly clear that effectors involved in invasion also participate in the intracellular phase of infection: the SPI-1 effectors SopB and SipA persist inside the host cell for several hours after bacterial entry, contributing to bacterial proliferation [10–13]; SopB also modulates the early stages of SCV biogenesis [13,14].

SCV maturation and movement towards the microtubule-organizing center Following bacterial uptake by macrophages or SPI-1-triggered invasion of nonphagocytic cells, SCV maturation and bacterial adaptation to the new environment create the conditions that enable the subsequent SPI-2-dependent intracellular multiplication of bacteria. The process of SCV maturation has been extensively reviewed [15,16] (Figure 1). Briefly, SCV maturation is dependent on different endocytic regulators, such as the small GTPases Rab5, Rab11 and Rab7 [15–17], and the general consensus is that within the first hour post-invasion (p.i.) the majority of SCVs mature into a compartment that has some characteristics of late endosomes, such as enrichment in

**Figure 1. Maturation of SCVs and the function of SPI-1 and SPI-2 T3SSs.** Upon cell contact, the SPI-1 T3SS injects bacterial effectors that remodel the host actin cytoskeleton, triggering cell invasion. SPI-1 effectors also participate in the early stages of bacterial vacuole biogenesis and some persist in the host cell (and on the SCV membrane) long after bacterial uptake. SCV maturation is characterized by selective interactions with the endocytic system. Bacterial vacuoles transiently acquire early and recycling endosomal markers such as early endosomal antigen 1 (EEA1), transferrin receptor (TfnR), Rab5 and Rab11. These proteins are then rapidly replaced by late endosomal markers, such as vacuolar ATPase (vATPase), lysosomal glycoproteins (lgps) and Rab7, which are maintained throughout infection. However, the late endosomal marker mannose 6-phosphate receptor (Man-6PR) is absent from the SCV, and the bacterial vacuoles seem to be mostly devoid of lysosomal enzymes, such as cathepsin D. SCV maturation is accompanied by centripetal movement along host cell MTs towards the MTOC, apparently powered by the dynein motor after its recruitment to the bacterial vacuoles by a signaling cascade initiated by Rab7 on the SCV. The SPI-2 T3SS becomes active at 3–4 h post-invasion. SPI-2 effectors translocated across the SCV promote intravacuolar replication of *Salmonella*. In epithelial cells, SPI-2 phenotypes visible by light microscopy include the formation along MTs of tubular structures that extend from the SCV, called Sifs, and the appearance of microcolonies surrounded by Golgi membranes. SPI-2 effectors frequently localize to the SCV membrane and to Sifs.

lysosomal glycoproteins (lgps) and an acidic lumen, but that does not interact with lysosomes (Figure 1). However, this dogma has been challenged recently by live imaging observations indicating that in epithelial cells significant direct interactions between the SCV and lysosomes do occur within the first two hours p.i. [18]. It is therefore unclear to what extent the bacterial vacuoles might fuse with lysosomes, but in any event the SPI-2 T3SS does not seem to be involved in regulating SCV–lysosomal interactions [19,20].

The maturation of SCVs is accompanied by their physical displacement along microtubules (MTs) towards the MT-organizing center (MTOC) (Figure 1), and at ~2 h p.i. most vacuoles localize to within 5 μm of the MTOC [21]. This centripetal movement is dependent on the dynein–dynactin motor complex that is recruited to the bacterial vacuoles by active Rab7 on the SCV membrane through its effector Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), which binds dynactin [22] (Box 1).

### SPI-2 effectors and SCV membrane dynamics

To date, 19 SPI-2 effectors have been identified, but the biochemical functions of most of them remain unknown (Table 1) [5,6]. Because each intracellular bacterium frequently resides within its own vacuole, the capacity of *Salmonella* to acquire the nutrients and membrane required for intravacuolar replication probably depends not only on interactions with host cell vesicular compartments, but also on the coordinated expansion and partitioning of the SCV membrane as the bacteria divide. It is therefore not surprising that several SPI-2 effectors are involved with SCV membrane dynamics (Table 1). Furthermore, SPI-2 effectors have been shown to act on MTs and the MT-associated motors (Table 1) kinesin-1 (which drives cargo movement towards the cell periphery) and dynein (which propels transport in the direction of the MTOC) (Box 1).

Box 1. The microtubule motors, kinesins and dyneins

In mammalian cells, cargo transport occurs along cytoskeletal tracks and is driven by three types of molecular motors: myosins, which move on actin filaments, and kinesins and dyneins, which travel on microtubules (MTs) [52,61]. Although the role of myosins in intracellular replication of Salmonella has not been investigated, MT motors have been the focus of intense investigation in recent years [43–45,48,49].

MTs are long polar structures with distinct minus and plus ends. In nonpolarized epithelial cells, such as HeLa cells (commonly used to study the intracellular life of Salmonella) MTs radiate from the MT-organizing center (MTOC), where their minus ends are clustered, towards the cell periphery, where their plus ends are located. Most kinesins power transport to the plus ends, whereas dyneins are minus-end-directed motors. Nevertheless, cargo movement along MTs is normally bidirectional employing both minus-end and plus-end motors [52]. Kinesins and dyneins are grouped into large protein superfamilies [62,63], of which kinesin-1 (also known as conventional kinesin) and cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) are the most abundant and studied members.

Kinesin-1 and dynein are composed of different subunits that assemble into a structure including a ‘tail’, which binds cargo, and two globular ‘heads’, which bind MTs and include the motor domain. Movement is energized by ATP hydrolysis, which causes a conformational change in the motor domain that is transmitted to the MT-binding site [61].

Dynein function requires its binding to dynactin, a large protein complex that participates in binding to MTs, enhances dynein processivity and also mediates interaction with cargo [64]. Recruitment of the dynein-dynactin complex to membranes is regulated by small GTPases of the Rab family [52]. In particular, Rab6 mediates dynein-dynactin recruitment to Golgi membranes through its effectors Bicaudal D1 and Bicaudal D2 [65,66], whereas Rab7 activates dynein on endosomal membranes. Mechanistically, GTP-bound Rab7 initiates a signaling cascade involving its effectors RILP and ORP1L and a general receptor for dynactin on vesicles, βIII spectrin [67]. Among these regulators of dynein-dynactin function, only Rab7 and RILP have been analyzed with respect to Salmonella intracellular replication.

from 4–5 h p.i., and include the formation of tight bacterial clusters (microcolonies) within the MTOC and Golgi region (see below) [21,23], and Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs) [24] (Figure 1). Sifs are lgp-enriched tubular structures that extend from the SCV along MTs towards the cell periphery [25]. Although their physiological significance is unclear, Sifs are associated with rapidly replicating bacteria [26] and might be a symptom of SPI-2-controlled vesicular fusion, and possibly budding, with the SCV membrane.

Several translocated SPI-2 effectors localize onto the cytoplasmic side of the SCV membrane and to Sifs; these include PipB2 [27], SopD2 [28,29], SseF [30], SseG [30], SseJ [31] and SifA [25] (Figure 1 and Table 1). SifA is anchored to the SCV membrane by lipid modification at its C-terminus [32] mediated by host cell geranyl transferases [33], whereas SseF and SseG possess transmembrane domains [6,23,34]. It is unknown how the other SPI-2 effectors are attached to the bacterial vacuolar membrane. All these effectors affect SCV membrane dynamics: sopD2 [29], sifA [35], sseF [30,36], sseG [30,36] and pipB2 [37] mutants display various defects in Sif biogenesis, and SseJ seems to inhibit Sif formation [26,38]. Additional bacterial proteins implicated in Sif biogenesis are the SPI-1 effector SipA [12], and the secreted protein SpvB [26].

The roles of SifA and PipB2 on Sif formation will be discussed below in the broader context of SCV membrane dynamics. However, the molecular mechanisms by which SseG, SseF, SseJ, SopD2, SipA or SpvB control Sif biogenesis are unknown.

membrane dynamics, but a distinct and most insightful phenotype is displayed by a *sifA* mutant. SifA-deficient bacteria gradually lose their vacuole in a variety of cell types *in vitro* [39–41], and in macrophages *in vivo* [42]. Maintenance of a vacuolar membrane is a crucial aspect of *Salmonella* virulence because bacteria are rapidly killed when released in the cytosol of macrophages [41], which are the main cell type colonized by *S.* Typhimurium during systemic infection of mice [42]; a *sifA* mutant is therefore strongly attenuated for virulence in mice [35,40]. However, an *ssaV* mutant, deficient in type III secretion activity, and hence incapable of translocating any SPI-2 effector, does not lose its vacuolar membrane [40]. This indicates that the action of SPI-2 effector(s) other than SifA creates the need for bacterial control of SCV membrane dynamics. Yet, the *sifA* mutant phenotype is not simply explained by inability of the bacteria to acquire the membrane required for intravacuolar multiplication because an auxotrophic *sifA* mutant, which does not replicate intracellularly, also cannot sustain the SCV membrane [38].

A major breakthrough in understanding the function of SifA was the discovery that this protein binds directly to a previously uncharacterized mammalian protein, named SifA and kinesin-interacting protein (SKIP) [43]. In addition, in contrast to wild-type (wt) vacuoles, a *sifA* mutant accumulates kinesin-1 on its vacuolar membrane, and this phenotype can be mimicked after infection by wt bacteria of cells depleted of SKIP by RNA interference (RNAi) [43]. Strikingly, in the absence of SifA, kinesin-1 recruitment to the SCV is dependent on the SPI-2 effector PipB2 [44]. Evidently, SifA, through SKIP, downregulates the PipB2-dependent recruitment of kinesin-1 to bacterial vacuoles [43,44]. PipB2 and SifA therefore have antagonistic functions (Figure 2a), but it is unknown how their actions are coordinated.

Why does the *sifA* mutant lose its vacuolar membrane?

Analysis of the mechanism by which the *sifA* mutant loses its vacuolar membrane has highlighted the roles of MT motors in SCV membrane dynamics. Different lines of

---

**Figure 2. Functions of SifA and PipB2 on the membrane of SCVs.**

(a) SifA binds directly to the mammalian protein SKIP. The SifA-SKIP complex antagonizes the PipB2-dependent recruitment of kinesin-1 to the SCV membrane. SifA might also inhibit dynein recruitment to the SCV by blocking the interaction between activated small GTPase Rab7 and its effector RILP, and control activity of other centrifugal motors, presumably kinesins (see Box 1).

(b) In vacuoles containing wild-type bacteria, a regulated level of opposing MT motor activity evidently ensures membrane stability, controlled vesicle fusion and budding, and kinesin-dependent Sif formation along MTs. In a *sifA* mutant, an imbalance of MT motors on the SCV ultimately results in membrane disruption. This could be a consequence of an altered membrane flow resulting from uncontrolled vesicle fusion with, and budding from, the SCV, or because the alteration in MT motor forces on the bacterial vacuole itself drives membrane rupture.

evidence suggest a model in which the uncontrolled opposing motor activity of kinesin and dynein on the sifA mutant vacuole eventually leads to SCV membrane disruption, as a result of an imbalance in membrane flow or of disproportional motor forces on bacterial vacuoles [43–45] (Figure 2b). This model is supported by the observations that inhibition of kinesin and dynein activity preserves the integrity of sifA mutant vacuoles [43,45], and that SKIP depletion by RNAi also results in membrane disruption of most wt SCVs [43]. However, in an apparent contradiction to this model, the vacuolar membrane of a sifA pipB 2 double mutant, which seemingly does not recruit kinesin-1 [44], is as unstable as that of a sifA mutant [27,44]. Nevertheless, the Sifs that extend from pipB 2 mutant SCVs are shorter than those detected in cells infected by wt bacteria [37]. Because centrifugal extension of Sifs is believed to rely on kinesin activity [22,45], this suggests that in a pipB 2 mutant the activity of the motor on the SCV is reduced, but not completely impaired. Therefore, residual kinesin-1 activity or another centrifugal motor might lead to vacuole loss in the sifA pipB 2 double mutant. Because the membrane enclosing pipB 2 mutant bacteria is as stable as that surrounding wt Salmonella [27], this suggests that SifA would also control the activity of the hypothetical additional centrifugal motor (Figure 2a).

SifA might also regulate dynein by disengaging the Rab7–RILP association at later times p.i. through its ability to bind to Rab7 [22] (Figure 2a), thereby preventing recruitment of the centripetal motor and enabling centrifugal extension of Sifs. In agreement with the hypothesis that SifA controls dynein through Rab7, expression of a dominant-negative form of the GTPase, or an inactive form of RILP that can still bind Rab7, also prevents loss of vacuolar membrane around most sifA mutant bacteria [45]. Moreover, although active Rab7 can be detected on the SCV throughout infection [22,46], the Rab7–RILP connection is blocked by the bacteria in a SPI-2-dependent manner at late infection times [22,46].

The SPI-2 effector SseJ also contributes to destabilization of the sifA mutant vacuole, probably by interfering with the lipid composition of the SCV membrane. SseJ displays amino acid sequence similarity to acyltransferases [5,6], and has deacylase activity in vitro [47]. In a sifA sseJ double mutant, which nevertheless accumulates kinesin-1 on its vacuole [44], membrane disruption is inhibited compared with a single sifA mutant [38,47], and this is dependent on the deacylase activity of SseJ [47].

The complex role of kinesin and dynein in intravacuolar replication of Salmonella is further emphasized by the negative effects of disrupting the activity of either motor, or of RILP overexpression, on bacterial intracellular growth [45,46], on Sif biogenesis [22,45] and on SCV morphology [45]. Furthermore, Salmonella induces an accumulation of MTs around most bacterial microcolonies [45,48]. Although MT accumulation seems to be a SPI-2-independent phenomenon [45], SPI-2 translocated SseF and SseG further promote MT bundling in about one-third of the infected cells, and display some degree of colocalization with host cell MTs [48]. However, the relevance of reorganization of the MT network and possible

downstream effects on associated motors has not been investigated in detail.

Although the observations described above strongly implicate direct effects of MT motors and their regulators in bacterial replication, in most studies interference with kinesin-1, dynein, Rab7, RILP or SKIP activity using dominant-negative constructs, RNAi or drugs must be performed before SCV maturation or even before cell invasion. Therefore, interpretation of the outcome of these experiments is complicated because the observed effect could also be a consequence of abnormal early SCV maturation. In addition, there is conflicting evidence regarding the presence of kinesin and dynein on wt bacterial vacuoles when detected by immunolabeling of the motors and confocal microscopy [12,22,43,45,46,49]. It seems likely that following invasion both motors are recruited to SCVs and influence their dynamics. However, at later times p.i., neither immunolabeled kinesin nor dynein have been convincingly shown to surround wt bacteria, unless SKIP levels are depleted [43], or RILP or Rab7 are overexpressed [45,46]. Furthermore, it should be borne in mind that the resolution of light microscopy does not permit the conclusion that kinesin or dynein are located on the SCV membrane, even if they appear to surround bacteria.

### SPI-2 effectors and the spatial distribution of SCVs

As mentioned above, replication of Salmonella within epithelial cells leads to the formation of bacterial microcolonies localized in the region of the MTOC and Golgi complex [21,23,34], in the vicinity of the nucleus [49] (Figure 1). This often results in the rearrangement of the normally compact structure of the Golgi stacks so that they form an arc or fully surround the cluster of SCVs. However, there is no evidence for direct fusion between the SCV and Golgi membranes [23,50]. Migration of SCVs from the cell periphery to the MTOC–Golgi region does not require the activity of the SPI-2 T3SS [21,49], but retention of the SCVs in this region of the cell is dependent on SseF, SseG and SifA [21,23,34,43,49]. From ~6 h p.i., whereas the majority of wt SCVs are relatively immobile, most vacuoles containing sseG or sseF mutant bacteria show a fast and random MT-dependent movement [21], resulting in their scattering throughout infected cells [21,23,34,49]. Furthermore, the few sifA mutants that are still in a vacuole also localize away from the Golgi [34,43].

Intracellular positioning of Salmonella vacuoles is also dependent on the SPI-1 effector SipA [12]. However, because SipA is also involved in Salmonella invasion, this SPI-1 effector might be required for initial SCV migration to the MTOC–Golgi region.

### How do SseF and SseG work?

The molecular mechanism by which SseF and SseG determine SCV positioning is presently unknown. However, genetic and biochemical evidence indicates that these effectors function as a complex attached to the SCV membrane, and perhaps to other membranous structures [6,23,34].

Two models have been put forward to explain how an SseF–SseG complex and SifA determine the spatial distribution of SCVs (Figure 3). In one, the localization of SCVs

Figure 3. Models to explain how SCV intracellular positioning is determined. (a) Model of balanced activity of MT motors: positioning of vacuoles containing wild-type bacteria is determined by regulated recruitment of kinesin and dynein governed by the SPI-2 effectors SifA, PipB2 and an SseF-SseG complex; vacuoles containing *sifA*, *sseG* or *sseF* mutant bacteria move away from the MTOC-Golgi region because of an imbalance in MT motors. (b) Golgi-tethering model: an SseF-SseG complex on the SCV membrane tethers the bacterial vacuoles to the Golgi membranes by an interaction with Golgi-related protein(s); in this scenario, in a *sifA* mutant the SseF-SseG complex would not be functional, and in the absence of SifA, SseF or SseG, SCVs scatter away from the center of the cell because they are no longer linked to Golgi membranes. For clarity, the Golgi representation is scaled down compared with the SCVs.

results from a balanced activity of dynein and kinesin on the SCV membrane [49,51]; the other proposes that tethering between an SseF-SseG complex and Golgi-related molecules determines SCV positioning [21,23].

**Model of balanced activity of MT motors**

The intracellular positioning of many cellular organelles and vesicles is dependent on MT motors [52], which suggests that SCV localization could be determined in an analogous manner. Evidence in favor of this model includes the observations that infection of SKIP-depleted cells with wt *Salmonella* results in dispersion of SCVs away from the MTOC-Golgi, and that disruption of kinesin activity restores the perinuclear localization of *sifA* mutant bacteria [43]. Therefore, it seems clear that SifA controls positioning of wt vacuoles by modulating kinesin activity through SKIP. However, it is puzzling that *sifA pipB2* double mutant vacuoles are scattered throughout the cells [44], but as discussed above, this could be explained by PipB2-independent and SifA-controlled centrifugal motor activity.

Dynein has also been implicated in SCV positioning, because the extent of dynein immunolabeling in the vicinity of *Salmonella* microcolonies is significantly reduced after infection with *sseF* and *sseG* mutants [49]. This suggests that the SseF-SseG complex controls positioning of bacterial vacuoles by modulating dynein activity on the SCV. However, recruitment of this motor could reflect its involvement in vesicular trafficking [50], rather than physical attachment to the SCV. Moreover, the effect

of inhibition of dynein activity with o-vanadate on the intracellular distribution of SCVs is modest [49] and likely to have pleiotropic effects, and disruption of dynein function by expression of a dominant-negative construct before *Salmonella* infection affects the initial migration of SCVs to a perinuclear position [22]. Therefore, although the 'balanced MT motor' model is simple and attractive, the role of dynein in SCV positioning, and its possible relation to SseF and SseG, needs further experimental support.

**Golgi-tethering model**

Arguments in favor of the 'tethering model' are that (i) treatment of HeLa cells with brefeldin A (BFA; a drug that blocks the activation of the small GTPase Arf1 and consequently prevents the formation of coat protein complex I (COPI)-coated vesicles, leading to Golgi redistribution into the endoplasmic reticulum [53,54]) mimics the phenotype of *sseF* and *sseG* mutants with respect to SCV positioning [21]; and (ii) a comparative live cell imaging analysis between the intracellular position of fast-moving *sseG* vacuoles and of the small proportion of wt SCVs that are capable of rapid movement, suggests that SseG function is restricted to the proximity of the MTOC-Golgi [21]. This model implies that the motility of *sseF* and *sseG* mutant vacuoles is not a consequence of imbalanced motor activity, but rather that without tethering, the mutant SCVs are free to move throughout the cell. However, prolonged BFA treatment is likely to have pleiotropic effects, and no Golgi protein has been shown to interact with SseF or SseG. But the major caveat of this model is that it does not easily

explain the intracellular positioning phenotype of *sifA* mutant vacuoles. However, a detailed analysis of the spatial distribution and movement of *sifA* mutant vacuoles over time has not been reported. Perhaps kinesin-1 accumulation on the *sifA* mutant SCV precedes formation of an active SseF–SseG complex, or uncontrolled kinesin activity on the SCV disrupts the protein complex involving the two effectors. In summary, there is scant compelling evidence for either hypothesis and it is possible that positioning of SCVs is governed by mechanisms that involve both motor balance and tethering.

### Physiological significance of SCV positioning in the MTOC-Golgi region

Several observations suggest that interactions between *Salmonella* and the Golgi complex are important for bacterial replication. First, treatment of infected cells with BFA impairs *Salmonella* intracellular replication in epithelial cells and macrophages [23]. Second, effective intracellular replication in epithelial cells seems restricted to perinuclear bacteria [23]. Third, *sseF* and *sseG* mutants display replication defects in epithelial cells and macrophages [23, 30, 34, 49], and are moderately attenuated for virulence in mice [34, 55]. The MTOC-Golgi region is at the intersection of the endocytic and exocytic pathways and is rich in recycling endosomes, late endosomes and lysosomes. Therefore, SCV positioning in this region of the cell could facilitate the interception of vesicular traffic that would satisfy bacterial requirements for nutrients or membrane, or both. In support of this hypothesis, there is a sustained interaction between SCVs and late endocytic compartments [18], and *Salmonella* redirects post-Golgi traffic in an SseG-, SseF- and SifA-dependent manner [50]. However, it is unknown to what extent these effects are dependent on SCV positioning. Furthermore, direct interactions with exocytic compartments remain to be shown, because fusion of constitutive secretory vesicles with bacterial vacuoles has not been observed [50], and disruption of the Golgi by treatment with BFA has no noticeable effect on SCV morphology [23].

### Concluding remarks and future perspectives

Normal intravacuolar replication of *Salmonella* is dependent on the action of SPI-2 effectors (PipB2, SifA, SseF and SseG) that hijack MT motors, interfere with regulators of their function, and might mediate tethering to Golgi membranes. Other bacterial effectors (such as SseJ and SopD2) are also involved in SCV membrane dynamics, but less is known about their functions. Future research on membrane dynamics and the control of intracellular positioning of SCVs is likely to focus on understanding mechanisms of action of SifA, PipB2, SseG and SseF, and particularly on finding the physiological functions and host cell targets of the many SPI-2 effectors for which a function has not been assigned (*Table 1* and *Box 2*). In parallel, RNAi will certainly be a useful tool to test the involvement of specific host cell proteins. From a technical point of view, as suggested by recent reports [18, 21, 50], developments in live cell imaging techniques promise to boost our understanding, and even change our perception, of the interactions between *Salmonella* and host cells.

**Box 2. Outstanding questions**

- What is the molecular basis for the influence of SopD2 and SseJ on SCV membrane dynamics?
- Are there other SPI-2 type III secretion effectors involved in SCV membrane dynamics?
- How are the antagonistic functions of PipB2 and SifA coordinated?
- Is there more than one type of kinesin recruited to the SCV membrane? How is SifA involved?
- How is dynein recruitment to the SCV membrane regulated? Is it dependent on SseF and SseG?
- Does SifA act directly on Rab7?
- What other host cell molecules (such as small GTPases of the Rab and Arf families) are involved in controlled vesicular exchange on the SCV?
- What is the physiological significance of the localization of SCVs into the MTOC region in epithelial cells?
- What are the host cell targets of SseF and SseG?

Ongoing studies in other bacterial pathogens are revealing an equally complex relationship between bacterial effectors and the host cell MT cytoskeleton and membrane trafficking. *Legionella*, which subverts transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi, has led to the identification of bacterial effectors [RalF and SidM (equally well known as DrrA)] that manipulate vesicular transport by activating the GTPases Arf1 and Rab1 [56–58] and of other effectors for which a biochemical function has not been established. In addition, *Brucella* hijacks endoplasmic reticulum traffic and *Chlamydia* intercepts exocytic vesicles from the trans-Golgi network [56, 59], but the bacterial effectors involved are unknown. Besides SifA and PipB2, only the action of VirA (a T3SS effector from *Shigella*, a nonvacuolated intracellular pathogen) on MTs is well established [60].

The complex and sometimes conflicting evidence discussed in this review is probably indicative of a sophisticated series of interactions between SCVs and host cell molecules. Continuing efforts to understand the function of SPI-2 effectors, and of translocated virulence proteins of other pathogens, promises many future surprises, and will enable an increased understanding of mechanisms of virulence of vacuolated intracellular bacteria and host cell biology in general.

**Elsevier celebrates two anniversaries with a gift to university libraries in the developing world**

In 1580, the Elzevir family began their printing and bookselling business in the Netherlands, publishing works by scholars such as John Locke, Galileo Galilei and Hugo Grotius. On 4 March 1880, Jacobus George Robbers founded the modern Elsevier company intending, just like the original Elzevir family, to reproduce fine editions of literary classics for the edification of others who shared his passion, other 'Elzeviriens'. Robbers co-opted the Elzevir family printer's mark, stamping the new Elsevier products with a classic symbol of the symbiotic relationship between publisher and scholar. Elsevier has since become a leader in the dissemination of scientific, technical and medical (STM) information, building a reputation for excellence in publishing, new product innovation and commitment to its STM communities.

In celebration of the House of Elzevir’s 425th anniversary and the 125th anniversary of the modern Elsevier company, Elsevier donated books to ten university libraries in the developing world. Entitled 'A Book in Your Name', each of the 6700 Elsevier employees worldwide was invited to select one of the chosen libraries to receive a book donated by Elsevier. The core gift collection contains the company's most important and widely used STM publications, including *Gray's Anatomy*, *Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary*, *Essential Medical Physiology*, *Cecil Essentials of Medicine*, *Mosby's Medical, Nursing and Allied Health Dictionary*, *The Vaccine Book*, *Fundamentals of Neuroscience*, and *Myles Textbook for Midwives*.

The ten beneficiary libraries are located in Africa, South America and Asia. They include the Library of the Sciences of the University of Sierra Leone; the library of the Muhimbili University College of Health Sciences of the University of Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; the library of the College of Medicine of the University of Malawi; and the University of Zambia; Universite du Mali; Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, Mozambique; Makerere University, Uganda; Universidad San Francisco de Quito, Ecuador; Universidad Francisco Marroquin, Guatemala; and the National Centre for Scientific and Technological Information (NACESTI), Vietnam.

Through 'A Book in Your Name', these libraries received books with a total retail value of approximately one million US dollars.
