### Abstract

The mammalian multifunctional protein-2 (MFP-2, also called multifunctional enzyme 2, D-bifunctional enzyme or 17-$\beta$-estradiol dehydrogenase type IV) was identified by several groups about a decade ago. It plays a central role in peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation as it handles most, if not all, peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation substrates. Deficiency of this enzyme in man causes a severe developmental syndrome with abnormalities in several organs but in particular in the brain, leading to death within the first year of life. Accumulation of branched-long-chain fatty acids and very-long-chain fatty acids and a disturbed synthesis of bile acids were documented in these patients. A mouse model with MFP-2 deficiency only partly phenocopies the human disease. Although the expected metabolic abnormalities are present, no neurodevelopmental aberrations are observed. However, the survival of these mice into adulthood allowed to document the importance of this enzyme for the normal functioning of the brain, eyes and testis. In the present review, the identification and biochemical characteristics of MFP-2, and the consequences of MFP-2 dysfunction in humans and in mice will be discussed.

### 1. Introduction

Although the bulk of long chain fatty acids are $\beta$-oxidised in mitochondria, several lipophilic carboxylates are dependent on peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation for chain shortening [1]. These substrates include very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA), polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), prostanooids like prostaglandines and leukotrienes, pristanic acid, di- and trihydroxycholestanoic acid ($C_{27}$-bile acid intermediates), long chain dicarboxylic fatty acids and the carboxyl side chain of some xenobiotics (Fig. 1). An important feature of these substrates, as will be discussed later, is the presence/absence of a 2-methylbranch. It should be noted that peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation not only serves a catabolic role, since the synthesis of mature bile acids and some polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) like docosahexaenoic ($C_{22:6n-3}$) and docosapentaenoic ($C_{22:5n-6}$) acid depends on this pathway.

Peroxisomal $\beta$-oxidation occurs in four steps, starting with the desaturation/oxidation of an acyl-CoA. In mammals, three different acyl-CoA oxidases are present. The first enzyme identified, often called palmitoyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1p), acts only on straight chain acyl-CoAs. The other oxidases, named trihydroxycholestanyl-CoA oxidase/branched chain acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox2p) and pristanoyl-CoA oxidase (Acox3p), can desaturate straight and 2-methyl branched acyl-CoAs [2,3]. The generated $2E$-enoyl-CoAs are hydrated to either $3S$- or $3R$-

hydroxyacyl-CoAs, also referred to as L-3-, respectively, D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, which are subsequently dehydrogenated to 3-ketoacyl-CoAs. These reactions are both catalyzed by two distinct multifunctional proteins. The first multifunctional protein (MFP-1) or L-bifunctional enzyme forms and dehydrogenates 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoAs and also harbors Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase activity, an auxiliary activity necessary for the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids [4]. The second multifunctional protein-2 (MFP-2), or D-bifunctional enzyme, converts the 2E-enoyl-CoAs into the corresponding 3-keto compounds via a 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA intermediate. The two multifunctional proteins have no sequence similarity and are structurally different. Their substrate specificities will be discussed below.

The final step in peroxisomal β-oxidation is the thiolytic cleavage of 3-ketoacyl-CoAs into chain-shortened acyl-CoAs and acetyl-CoA, or propionyl-CoA when the β-oxidation substrate carries a 2-methylbranch. It can be catalyzed by two kinds of thiolases, 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase [5], which occurs as two isoforms in rodents, and sterol carrier protein x [6]. 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase acts on straight chain ketoacyl-CoAs, sterol carrier protein x catalyzes the cleavage of both straight chain and 2-methyl ketoacyl-CoAs such as the keto-intermediates in the breakdown of pristanic acid and cholestanic acid [7].

In addition to these enzymes, peroxisomes harbor other important proteins directly or indirectly linked to β-oxidation such as acyl-CoA synthetases and 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase. The latter enzyme is able to switch the configuration of the methyl branch of 2-methylacyl-CoAs. Since Acox2p and Acox3p recognize only 2S-methylacyl-CoAs, the racemase activity is necessary for the breakdown of C₂₇-bile acid intermediates, formed as 25R-compounds, and of 2R-pristanic acid, occurring naturally or formed via α-oxidation of its precursor, 3R-phytanic acid [2,3]. Peroxisomes also contain enzymes shifting or reducing double bonds in unsaturated acyl-CoAs, such as Δ3,5-Δ2,4-dienoyl-CoA isomerases, Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase and 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase, all accessory enzymes for breakdown of mono/poly unsaturated fatty acids. Also, 2-enoyl-CoA reductase, likely involved in fatty acid elongation, carnitine acyl-CoA transferases, bile acid conjugating enzymes and acyl-CoA thioesterases are present in this organel.

### 2. The enzyme multifunctional protein-2

#### 2.1. Identification

MFP-2 protein was identified at about the same time (between 1994 and 1998) by six different groups in five different vertebrates. Several approaches led to its discovery, explaining why alternative names are in use for the same enzyme (Table 1).

(1) During their study of 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases using the pig as a model, the group of Adamski isolated a 32-kDa protein from porcine endometrium in 1992 [8]. Further cloning revealed that this protein corresponds to an N-terminal fragment of a larger multidomain protein of 80 kDa with estradiol dehydrogenase activity, and it was called 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase [9]. Through library screening with the porcine cDNA, the human and mouse cDNA were identified [10,11] and the enzyme was named 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type IV, because three other 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases had already been described.

(2) In a study on the presence of enoyl-CoA hydratases in rat liver, the group of Hiltunen isolated a peroxisomal enzyme of 33.5 kDa from rat liver in 1993. This enzyme displayed reversible hydration/dehydration activity between 2E-enoyl-CoA and 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA, but 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoAs could not be dehydrated to 2E-enoyl-CoAs by this enzyme [12]. Further studies by this group resulted in the cloning and purification of MFP-2 from rat liver [13].

(3) The different peroxisomal β-oxidation steps, including the dehydrogenation of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs, were analyzed in a systematic study by the group of Van Veldhoven and Mannaerts in 1994 [14]. Besides MFP-1 (78 kDa monomeric), a 79-kDa protein displaying 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase and 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity was purified and the enzyme was named MFP-2 [15]. Furthermore, a dimer of the dehydrogenase domain of MFP-2 (89 kDa) [15] and a 45-kDa fragment containing the hydratase domain was isolated [16]. Cloning of rat MFP-2 [15] revealed that its sequence was very similar to that of the porcine estradiol 17β-dehydrogenase (type IV) [9]. Also human peroxisomes were shown to contain a D-specific MFP-2 [17].

(4) The group of Hashimoto and coworkers purified in 1996 medium-chain enoyl-CoA hydratases (a 77-kDa polypeptide and a homodimer consisting of 46 kDa polypeptides) from human liver. Activity measurements revealed that these enzymes catalyzed the dehydration of 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoAs [18,19]. At the same time, the 77-kDa polypeptide was purified from rat liver peroxisomes and shown to display both 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and dehydratase activity [20]. The 77-kDa protein is the full-length MFP-2, whereas the 46-kDa polypeptide is the hydratase domain of MFP-2. Cloning of the human 77 kDa protein revealed homology to 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase type IV.

(5) In an attempt to look for genes whose mRNA levels are modulated by peroxisome proliferators, the group of Gustafsson isolated in 1996 an upregulated cDNA from liver of treated rats, which showed high similarity with the porcine estradiol 17β-dehydrogenase type IV cDNA [9,21].

(6) By yet another approach, the chicken protein was identified by Kobayashi et al. in 1997 [22]. In order to identify proteins that are expressed specifically in retinal pigment epithelial cells, monoclonal antibodies were raised. One of these antibodies, which recognized a

<sup>a</sup> related to nucleotide sequence.  
<sup>b</sup> PTS1 is defined as a C-terminal tripeptide, however residues upstream do influence the strength of binding. In vertebrates, the -1 position is often occupied by a positively charged residue [151], in MFP2, however, a tyrosine residue is highly conserved.  
<sup>c</sup> Partly based on AB125175, but corrected by EST information.  
<sup>d</sup> Based on UnigeneCfal 4480, unpublished data.  
<sup>e</sup> Based on CAAE01015007, but with corrected exon prediction (unpublished data).

[13,33–35]. Ahead of this motif, a conserved serine residue (Ser151) is present, proposed to assist in the proper positioning of the hydroxyl group of the substrate [13,32,34,35] (see also Fig. 4).

### 2.3.1. The N-terminal dehydrogenase domain

Homology searches of the 32 kDa subunit of porcine estradiol 17β-dehydrogenase [8] revealed similarity to sequences of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase family [31] and delineated three conserved regions: (1) in the N-terminus conserved amino acids (Gly16, Gly18 and Gly22) are part of a Rossman (βαβ) fold. The liganded crystal structure of the dehydrogenase domain of rat MFP-2 shows that these glycines are in contact with the cofactor NAD⁺ [32] (Fig. 4); (2) the substrate binding site between amino acids 91–103; (3) the amino acids 164–168 containing the catalytic site with the highly conserved Tyr-X-X-Lys-motif which was suggested to interact with the hydroxyl group in the substrate

The N-terminal domain of MFP-2 displays less than 25% sequence identity with any of the other cloned 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (Table 3), except for type 8 and 10 which display 30–35% similarity [36,37]. Interesting to mention is that 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 10 is in fact a mitochondrial short chain 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (Table 3) [24] which is able to dehydrogenate 17β-hydroxysteroids besides 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoAs [38]. The N-terminal part of MFP-2 also shows a high degree of identity with two regions (both containing dehydrogenase activity) in the N-terminus of the peroxisomal multifunctional β-oxidation protein of fungi (FOX2): Saccharomyces cerevisiae (54%

Clustal-phylogram

Fig. 2. Evolutionary relationship between MFP-2 of different species. Amino acid sequences of MFP-2 proteins, compiled in Table 1 and 2, were aligned with Multalin [161] (parameters: comparison table blosum62; gap weight: 12; gap length weight: 2), followed by generation of phylogenetic tree presented as a phenogram. For the branch related to *O. sativa*, see footnote g of Table 2.

two hydratase activities, one associated with MFP-1 and the other associated with MFP-2, with different stereospecificities [13,49,50]. Both proteins hydrate straight chain 2E-enoyl-CoAs. MFP-1 is somewhat more active toward short chain enoyl-CoAs and generates 3S-hydroxyacyl-CoA, whereas MFP-2 forms 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA (Fig. 6). This stereoselectivity is also maintained for the reverse reaction [15,18,49,50]. Whether MFP-2 can hydrate 2Z-enoyl-CoA has not been investigated, but MFP-1 converts these into 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA (in vitro)¹. When the substrate contains a methyl branch in α-position of the carboxygroup (like in bile acid intermediates and pristanic acid), the situation is somewhat more complex as four possible 3-hydroxy-2-methylacyl-CoA stereoisomers can be generated from the 2-enoyl-CoAs. Rat and human MFP-2 or the isolated hydratase domain of rat MFP-2 convert 24E-trihydroxycholesteryl-CoA (the product of the first step in peroxisomal β-oxidation of trihydroxycholestanyl-CoA) only to 24R,25R-varanoyl-CoA² and not to one of the three other stereoisomers (Fig. 6). MFP-1 forms the 24S,25S-isomer of varanoyl-CoA. The stereochemistry of the products indicates that the hydration proceeds via a syn mechanism [15,17,50,55,56].

The stereospecific breakdown of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids was also investigated. In this case advantage was taken of the reversibility of the reaction and the dehydratase activity was studied. These experiments demonstrated that rat MFP-2 exclusively dehydrates the 3R-hydroxy-2R-methyl-branched-chain acyl-CoA isomer and MFP-1 exclusively the 3S,2S stereoisomer [16]. Because the reaction is reversible, the results indicate that the hydration of 2E-pristenyol-CoA by MFP-2 results in the production of the 3R,2R stereoisomer.

2.4.2. 3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase

MFP-2 only dehydrogenates the D-isomer of straight chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, or in the reversed reaction, produces the D-isomer when given 3-ketoacyl-CoAs. The dehydrogenation

---

¹ It is unlikely that this activity has a physiological consequence as the degradation of naturally occurring unsaturated fatty acids with a cis-bound at even position will yield 4-cis-2-trans-enoyl-CoA which are converted to 2-trans-enoyl-CoA via 2,4-dienoyl-CoA reductase and Δ3,Δ2-enoyl-CoA isomerase.

² Varanic acid is the 24-hydroxy derivative of trihydroxycholestanoic acid. The 24R,25R-isomer, proposed as the physiological intermediate [51] was originally described as the (24R,25S) isomer [15,52], but experimental evidence [53], and stereochemical synthesis of the different isomers [54] has resulted in the revised assignment of this isomer to (24R,25R) and of (24R,25R) to (24R,25S).

Fig. 5. The central domain of MFP-2. (A) Vertebrate MFP-2s were aligned as described in Fig. 4, and the region corresponding to the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase domains of the human protein and the consensus are shown, using the same color and symbol codes as in Fig. 4. Various protic residues are identical or conserved: Glu366 and Asp510 are involved in the catalysis; Lys435 forms a salt bridge with the 3′-phosphate group of the CoA-ester, while Arg562 is interacting with the adenine group of the substrate. (B) Ribbon presentation of the hydratase domain of human MFP-2. Reprinted from [43] with permission from Elsevier.

dehydrogenase activity of MFP-1 and MFP-2 towards branched chain substrates was examined. None was active towards the 24S,25S- and 24R,25S-stereoisomers whereas MFP-1 catalyzed the dehydrogenation of the 24S,25R-stereoisomer (L-stereo-specificity) and MFP-2 that of the 24R,25R-isomer (D-stereospecificity) (Fig. 6) [15,17,56,61,62]. Similar stereospecificities were observed by using the different stereoisomers of 3-hydroxy-2-methylhexadecanoyl-CoA, proving that the 3R,2R-isomer is dehydrogenated by MFP-2 [13,16,40].

Because MFP-1 cannot dehydrogenate its own formed stereoisomer, it was concluded that MFP-2, and not MFP-1, is involved in the synthesis of bile acids and in the degradation of 2-methyl-branched fatty acids. After the characterization of α-methylacyl-CoA racemase, it was proven that this enzyme is able to convert the 24S,25S-bile acid intermediate into the 24S,25R- stereoisomer in vitro [63]. Thus, chain shortening of cholesterol could potentially be executed by the combined action of MFP-1 and α-methylacyl-CoA racemase. Furthermore, MFP-1 could play a role in the breakdown of 24S-hydroxycholesterol released from brain [64].

### 2.4.3. 17β-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase

In sex steroid metabolism, 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases catalyze the last step in steroid synthesis or the first step in steroid breakdown. Potent sex steroids require the presence of a hydroxyl group at the 17β position on the steroid nucleus. Each 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase isozyme has preferentially either a reductive or oxidative activity (Table 3) resulting in the formation or inactivation of potent steroid hormones, respectively. Also, the tissue distribution differs for the different isotypes [65,66]. Since the end of the 1980s at least eleven isotypes have been described, of which isotypes 2, 4, 8, 9, 10 and 11 are preferentially oxidative and share the same steroid substrates (Table 3) [24,65].

MFP-2 dehydrogenates Δ5-androstene-3β,17β-diol and estradiol to their less active 17-oxo-forms. Only the 17β-hydroxyl group of steroid hormones and not the other hydroxyl groups, are dehydrogenated [10,15]. The reverse reduction of estrone and dehydroepiandrosterone is 400-fold slower than the oxidation reaction.

The dehydrogenase activity with estradiol as a substrate is several fold lower than that with 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs (approximately 300-fold lower compared to 24R,25R-varanoyl-CoA [15] and 370,000-fold lower compared to 3-hydroxydecanyl-CoA [13]). The \(K_m\) values are 100-fold lower for the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity (0.3–0.4 μM) than for the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase activity (31–35 μM) [67]. Both \(K_m\) values are compatible with the physiological concentrations of the substrates and close to those of other dehydrogenases active on these substrates [31]. Although the

Fig. 6. Stereospecificity of the different MFP activities. The configuration of the intermediates formed by the 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase (left) and 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (right) activities of MFP-1 and MFP-2 are shown, starting from either 2-enoyl-CoA (straight chain substrates) or 2-methyl-2-enoyl-CoA (2-methylbranched substrates). For the latter, the four 3-hydroxy-2-methylacyl-CoA isomers that can theoretically be formed are drawn with 3,2 nomenclature referring to pristanic acid derivatives and 24,25 nomenclature referring to cholestanoic derivatives. In fact, only two 3-hydroxy-2-methylacyl-CoA isomers are formed by the hydratases, of which the 3S,2S (designated as 24S,25S in case of a cholestanoic acid derivative) isomer can be converted into the 3S,2R-isomer via 2-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR).

high expression and regulation of MFP-2 in reproductive organs (see Sections 2.5 and 2.6) and the low \( K_{\text{m}} \) value may be indicative of a physiological steroid dehydrogenase function of MFP-2 to reduce circulating levels of estradiol, other arguments do not support such a role, e.g., its peroxisomal localisation, the association with the hydratase domain and its low activity with estradiol as a substrate. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that the enzyme is present in these reproductive organs with regard to its capacity to β-oxidise fatty acids.

### 2.4.4. Role of the Sterol carrier protein-2 domain in enzyme activities

The biological role of the C-terminal part of MFP-2, with strong sequence similarity to the lipid transfer protein SCP-2, is still uncertain. It has been suggested from in vitro studies that SCP-2 and SCP-x containing the SCP-2 domain might be involved in substrate transfer from one enzyme to the other in the peroxisomal β-oxidation sequence [68,69]. However, there is no experimental proof for such a role in vivo. In addition,

the transport of fatty acids does not seem to be facilitated by SCP-2 in vitro. The hydratase or dehydrogenase activities of MFP-2 towards steroids or fatty acyl-CoAs are not changed if the SCP-2 domain is deleted [67]. In our hands, oxidation of 2-methylhexadecanoate and lignocerate (\( C_{24:0} \)) was restored in MFP-2-deficient cells after expressing MFP-2 constructs lacking the SCP-2 domain (Van Veldhoven P.P. and Baes M., unpublished observations).

The crystal structure of the SCP-2 domain of MFP-2 revealed a hydrophobic tunnel that traverses the domain, large enough to accommodate straight- and branched-chain fatty acyl-CoAs and bile acid intermediates [46]. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the same study, as unpublished results, that among several fatty acyl-CoAs tested, long and very-long-chain acyl-CoA esters are the best ligands. Similar ligand specificities have been described for the SCP-2 domain of SCP-x [69]. MFP-2 and its isolated SCP-2 domain display high transfer activities for phospholipids and sterols in vitro [70], but it is not known whether this is necessary for bile acid

synthesis or inactivation of potent steroids. Furthermore, in fungi and some insects, MFP-2 protein lacks the SCP-2 domain (see Table 2). Overall, the data indicate that the SCP2 domain is dispensable for a proper functioning of peroxisomal β-oxidation.

### 2.5. Gene structure and regulation

In man, the MFP-2 gene is located on chromosome 5q2.3 at interval D5S471–D5S393 with a physical position of 484.22 cR<sub>3000</sub> [17,31,71]. It is more than 100 kb long [72] and consists of 24 exons varying in length between 22 to 425 bases<sup>3</sup> (Fig. 3). Although the N-terminal domain of MFP-2 shares functional and amino acid similarity with the family of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases and the central domain with several fatty acid hydratases, neither the sizes nor the exon/intron structures of the corresponding genes are similar. However, the organisation of the last three exons of the SCP-x/SCP-2 gene are similar to those of *MFP-2* [72], suggesting a common genetic origin. In mouse, rat and chimpanzee the MFP-2 gene is localised, respectively, to chromosome 18; chromosome 18q11, and chromosome 4. In both rodents, like in man and chimpanzee, the gene comprises 24 exons<sup>3</sup>.

The promoter region 1.6 kb upstream of the start codon of the human *MFP-2* gene has been sequenced, but no classical TATA box was found. It was shown that the first 400 bp upstream of the transcription start site are sufficient for basal promoter activity in vitro, although the activity increased when a longer 1200 bp fragment was used [72]. Putative regulatory regions in the 1.6-kb promoter region include consensus sequences for different transcription factors: PEA3, C/EBP, PPAR, AP2 and NFκB [72]. Recently, it was shown that the promoter also contains an Sp1/AP2 binding site within 197 bp upstream of the translation start site [73]. Peroxisome proliferators are a variety of substances that induce the expression of several peroxisomal and extra-peroxisomal proteins in rodents and in humans through a PPARα-dependent mechanism, although the peroxisome proliferation response is restricted to rodents [74,75].

Treatment of rats and mice with peroxisome proliferators, like di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, WY-14643, gemfibrozil and di-*n*-butyl phthalate, increased the expression of MFP-2 in liver (3- to 4-fold at the mRNA level and 4- to 95-fold at the protein level) and kidney (3- to 9-fold at the protein level) [20,21,76,77], but not in adrenals, brown fat, heart, testis and uterus [76]. Aoyama et al. [74] demonstrated that after treatment of mice with WY-14643, MFP-1 and MFP-2 protein levels were both increased 6- to 7-fold in liver. On the other hand

microarray analysis of rat hepatoma cell lines after treatment with the same proliferator documented a 27-fold increase in the mRNA levels of MFP-1, whereas the levels of MFP-2 were only 2.6 times elevated [78]. The induction of MFP-2 is PPARα-dependent since the increase in mRNA and protein levels was absent from liver and kidney of *PPARα* knockout mice treated with peroxisome proliferators [74,76].

Treatment with fibrates, another class of potent peroxisome proliferators, yielded conflicting results. No induction of MFP-2 was observed in rats treated with clofibrate [15]. In another study ciprofibrate evoked a 3- to 5-fold increase in protein levels of MFP-2, but a 120-fold increase of MFP-1 [13,79]. In mouse liver, MFP-2 and MFP-1 transcripts were induced by, respectively, 5-fold and 20-fold after treatment with ciprofibrate [60]. On the other hand, ciprofibrate down-regulated the expression of MFP-2 in guinea pigs [30]. All together, it seems that the induction of MFP-2 by peroxisome proliferators is much more variable than for MFP-1.

During the estrous cycle in the pig, immunoreactivity for MFP-2 increases and decreases in endometrial cells together with the progesterone levels [80]. One study describes the upregulation of MFP-2 by synthetic glucocorticoids in a human THP1 myeloid leukemia cell line [81]. In equine preovulatory follicles, MFP-2 mRNA and protein were shown to increase after treatment with hCG, primarily due to elevated expression in granulosa cells [82].

#### 2.6. Tissue distribution

##### 2.6.1. RNA Analysis

MFP-2 mRNA is widely found in different organs, although the expression levels vary depending on the tissues and species. In man, the highest mRNA levels are found in liver, heart, hippocampus, prostate and testis [10,83]. Moderate expression occurred in osteoblasts, mammary epithelial cells, cortex, the subcortical white matter of the temporal lobe, lung, skeletal muscle, kidney, pancreas, thymus, ovary, intestine and placenta [84–86]. In adult mouse, the highest mRNA levels were found in liver, kidney and adrenals but MFP-2 transcripts were also present in testis, heart, brain and skeletal muscle [11,87]. MFP-2 is highly expressed at very early stages of mouse embryonic development (from E9.5) [87,88]. mRNA is found also in the following tissues of different species (rat, chicken, monkey): hypophysis, retina, thymus, gizzard, brown fat, mammary gland, uterus and skin [13,15,22,76,89,90].

##### 2.6.2. Immunohistochemistry

In human brain MFP-2 immunoreactive neurons and glial cells are already present during gestational week 16 and even earlier in Purkinje cells [91]. In the adult cerebrum, neurons in all areas were found to be immunopositive for MFP-2. The somata as well as the dendrites displayed fine granular immunostaining whereas the axons were immunonegative. Glial cells in the white matter were immunoreactive. In the cerebellum no staining for MFP-2 was found in the granule cell layer, whereas Purkinje cells, neurons of the dentate nucleus and glial cells in the white matter were positive [92]. Purkinje cell positive staining was

also observed in murine and porcine brain [11,93]. Recently, strong expression of MFP-2 was found in ependymal cells, by identification of MFP-2 as the antigen of brain-reactive human antibodies isolated from peripheral blood of a patient with Stiffman syndrome [94]. This is a rare disorder of the central nervous system characterized by progressive muscle rigidity and superimposed painful spasms. Autoantibodies against MFP-2 are found in 12% of the patients [94]. In eyes of ten-day-old chick embryos abundant expression was found in the retinal pigment epithelial cells but not in the neural retina [22].

Since MFP-2 contains 17β-estradiol dehydrogenase activity, its expression in gonads was examined. Human ovarian surface epithelial cells were strongly immunoreactive whereas the stroma was only slightly stained with an MFP-2 antibody [95]. In mouse, as in pig, MFP-2 was observed in luminal and glandular uterine epithelium [11,80]. Furthermore, developing follicles of the murine and porcine ovary showed intense staining of granulosa cells, whereas theca interna and externa layers were not labeled. The highest expression was found in the corpus luteum [11,96]. In pig, strong MFP-2 staining was found in Leydig cells of the testis whereas Sertoli cells were stained to a lesser extent [96]. The epithelial cells of the prostate were also immunopositive [31]. In the mouse, Leydig cells stained positive but Sertoli cells were immunonegative according to Normand et al. [11]. However, our recent investigations documented MFP-2 immunoreactivity in cultured rat Sertoli cells [97].

Human, porcine and murine renal tubular cells displayed intense granular immunostaining, but the glomeruli were immunonegative [11,92]. The protein was also found in human hepatocytes and in porcine myocytes and bronchial epithelium [31,92,93].

### 2.7. Processing

In tissue homogenates, prepared in the presence of protease inhibitors, MFP-2 is not only present as a full length 79 kDa protein, but also in processed forms. Both the dehydrogenase domain of 32 kDa in pig [9,34] or 40 kDa in rat [13,14] and the other 45 kDa part of MFP-2, containing the hydratase and SCP-2 domain, can be demonstrated by Western blot analysis [13,15,18,49]. Similar proteolysis occurs in guinea pig liver (34 kDa and 45 kDa) [98] and in human fibroblasts (45 and 35 kDa) [98]. This indicates that MFP-2 is most probably cleaved in vivo in these species. However, this proteolytic processing is incomplete since also the 79-kDa band was detectable on immunoblots of tissue/cell extracts or isolated peroxisomes by using antibodies raised against the hydratase or dehydrogenase domain of MFP-2 [10,13,49]. There are no reports that the SCP-2 domain is cleaved off as is described for SCP-x/SCP-2 [44], but upon expression of rat MFP-2 in *Pichia pastoris*, a cleavage product of 66 kDa is formed which might lack this domain [13] (see also blots in [98]: faint band at 65 kDa in controls).

Cleavage is not necessary for the activity since in fibroblasts from patients with a defective PTS-1 import (Zellweger syndrome) MFP-2 is not processed and still normally active [98].

The extent of processing of MFP-2 varies among tissues and species. Immunoblot analyses of porcine organs demonstrated that steroid sensitive tissues like uterus and mammary glands display high levels of processing whereas in tissues with high peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism (liver and kidney) processing was low [99,100]. These differences in processing efficiency could suggest that processing activates or stimulates the steroid dehydrogenase capacity. However, human embryonic kidney cells (in which no processing occurs), expressing either MFP-2 or the 32 kDa N-terminal dehydrogenase domain of MFP-2, displayed no difference in 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity [67]. Processing of MFP-2 is absent in fibroblasts from Zellweger patients but not in Pex7p-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that the full length MFP-2 is processed after transport into peroxisomes, and that the processing enzyme which catalyzes the cleavage contains a PTS1 signal [98,101].

## 3. Multifunctional protein-2 deficiency

### 3.1. Historical background

In retrospect, the first patients with MFP-2 deficiency have been described by Goldfischer et al. [102] and Aubourg et al. [103] in 1986, well before the MFP-2 enzyme had been characterized. Because of the clinical similarity with Zellweger and adrenoleukodystrophy patients, they were, respectively, classified as “Pseudo-Zellweger syndrome” and “neonatal adrenoleukodystrophy” patients. Histological and metabolic investigations revealed that these patients had intact peroxisomes but very low peroxisomal β-oxidation activity and elevated levels of VLCFA and bile acid intermediates. It was believed for a long time that the “Goldfischer patient” carried a peroxisomal 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase deficiency [104], until recent reinvestigation identified both patients as MFP-2 deficient [105,106].

In 1989, Watkins et al. [107] described a patient which was proposed to suffer from “peroxisomal bifunctional enzyme deficiency”, referring to a deficiency of MFP-1. In this patient VLCFA and trihydroxycholestanoic acid levels were elevated in plasma, whereas pristanic acid was not quantified, and β-oxidation of lignoceric acid in cultured fibroblasts was significantly impaired. By using fibroblasts from the “Watkins patient”, additional patients with “bifunctional protein deficiency” were identified by complementation analysis [108–116]. After the purification, cloning and determination of the substrate specificity of MFP-2, it was discovered that not MFP-1 but MFP-2 is able to convert the CoA-ester of trihydroxycholestanoic acid [15,16,61] and it was suggested that the presumed MFP-1-deficient patients were in fact lacking MFP-2. After the first report on a patient with an established MFP-2 deficiency [117], the group of Wanders reinvestigated about 40 patients previously diagnosed as MFP-1 deficient, including the reference case identified by Watkins et al. [107], and demonstrated that all these patients had a defect in MFP-2 [35,101,118].
3.2. Three subgroups

In view of the distinct enzymatic activities that are executed by the MFP-2 enzyme, it was not surprising that three subgroups of patients could be identified [115, 116, 118–120]: (1) type I patients in which MFP-2 is completely absent including the patients reported by Goldfischer and Watkins [101, 105]; (2) type II patients in which the 2E-enoyl-CoA hydratase domain of MFP-2 is deficient [98]; (3) type III patients with mutations in the 3R-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase encoding part of the *MFP-2* gene [35].

In a recent extensive study on 110 patients, a genotype–phenotype correlation was found based on structural data of the protein, clinical observations and biochemical analyses [121]. Mutations that are most detrimental for the protein structure result in low residual MFP-2 activity in cultured fibroblasts and correlate with the most severe phenotype. In type I patients, major deletions or truncations are always found and these patients die before the age of 14 months. Point mutations in either the hydratase or dehydrogenase domain that cause amino acid changes in the residues necessary for substrate or cofactor binding, catalytic activity, folding or dimerization are also associated with severe phenotypes. In eight patients that survived beyond the age of 3 years, mutations were milder comprising changes in amino acids important for protein stabilization, replacements between amino acids of a similar kind or combinations of mutations in two different domains of the protein in compound heterozygotes [121]. A comprehensive overview of the distribution of clinical abnormalities over 126 patients was recently described [122]. We here present the most common pathologies that were observed in MFP-2-deficient patients. It should be noted that the clinical presentation of patients affected with MFP-2 deficiency strongly resembles that of patients with a severe peroxisome biogenesis disorder. An overview cataloguing all case studies on MFP-2-deficient patients is available in a supplementary table online.

3.3. Major pathologies in patients with MFP-2 deficiency

3.3.1. Phenotype at birth

By far the most penetrant hallmark of MFP-2-deficient patients is the profound neonatal hypotonia. Patients lay almost immobile with arms and legs abducted, most of them unable to suck. Tendon stretch reflexes are absent and they have an expressionless face [102, 103, 107–109, 111, 114, 122–127]. Supplementary tube feedings throughout life because of poor sucking and continuing profound hypotonia are common [102, 103, 107, 108, 123].

Dysmorphic features occur in two thirds of the patients although they may vary from subtle dysmorphia, like shallow supra-orbital ridges only up to macrocephaly with a typical Zellweger facies [98]. Dysmorphia can include: elongated head, elongated ears and long philtrum [128]; prominent or high forehead and frontal bossing [35, 123]; low-set ears and a large fontanel [35]; low/broad nasal bridge [127, 129]; slight hypertelorism, micrognathia, epicanthal folds, anteverted nostrils and a high arched palate [109, 126].

3.3.2. Liver

Fifty percent of the patients develop hepatomegaly [102, 103, 114, 122–124, 127, 129, 130]. Upon histological examinations, large fat droplets that stained with oil red O were found in hepatocytes of several patients. They were often birefringent in polarized light. At the periphery of these droplets, membranous lamellae were detected (cfr. adrenocortical cells in Zellweger and X- and neonatal ALD) [102, 123, 125, 131]. Other less common liver pathologies included fibrosis, proliferation of bile canaliculi and hemosiderosis [108]. In most patients, peroxisomes were larger and less abundant than in normal hepatocytes (1.0 μm in diameter vs. 0.5 μm)[102, 122, 123, 125], similar to those in acyl-CoA oxidase-deficient patients. Furthermore, elongated peroxisomes in direct contact with fat droplets [102, 131, 132] were noted. In a few patients, peroxisomes were absent from hepatocytes [122]. Also in fibroblast cultures of MFP-2-deficient patients peroxisomes appeared larger but less abundant than in control cells [35, 110, 117, 133].

3.3.3. Brain

Almost all patients develop seizures in the neonatal period [102, 103, 103, 107, 109, 122, 123, 126, 127], although they only occur after 2 months in others [35, 129, 134]. Developmental progress is very poor for all patients: failure to track objects or smile, to coo or to lift the head [102, 110, 123, 125].

Cytoarchitectonic changes were the most frequently observed brain abnormalities [122] and encompassed (1) areas of polymicrogyria and pachygyria; (2) heterotopic neurons in the cerebrum and cerebellum [102, 103, 111, 123, 125, 126, 129]; (3) dysplasia of the olive [111, 126] or pachygyric and fragmented olivary nuclei [125]; (4) loss of neurons in medullary olives and loss of olivocerebellar fibers [123]. In contrast with the above mentioned patients no significant abnormalities of cortical cytoarchitecture were found in others [103, 122, 125].

Examination of the white matter by histological analysis, computer tomography or MRI revealed abnormalities in some but not in all patients. Demyelinating lesions were seen in brain and spinal cord upon histological examination of several patients that were 6 months or older [102]. In addition, PAS-positive macrophages [123] in cerebral cortex and deep gray matter [107, 123] were present in some patients and many cells contained oil red O-positive tiny fat droplets [102, 103]. Findings with computer tomography ranged from decreased density of the white matter but no atrophy or gross anomaly [102], demyelination [103, 123], oedematous density of the white matter [103] to normal cerebral white matter [134]. MRI documented delayed myelination [126] and white matter abnormalities consistent with dysmyelination [35].

In several patients the cerebellum is more severely affected than the cerebrum. Gliosis [102, 123], demyelination centered around the dentate nucleus [102, 123] and demyelination of the cerebellar white matter and in the tegmentum of the brain stem [103] were described.

3.3.4. Peripheral nervous system

Nerve conduction velocity studies, performed during the neonatal period, yielded normal results [102, 103]. Neurophysiological
examinations in another case suggested initial dysmyelination followed by progressive demyelination and axonal degeneration in the brain stem and signs of peripheral neuropathy [134].

### 3.3.5. Other organs: bone, kidney, adrenal gland, eyes

Patellar calcifications, characteristic for Zellweger patients, occur in some [102,122,123,125,129] but not all patients [110]. A skeletal survey revealed generalized osteopenia and delayed bone maturation in two patients [107,124] and several presented with osteoporosis [111].

In contrast to Zellweger patients, renal cysts were present only in a few MFP-2-deficient patients [102,107,122,124,129]. Absence of MFP-2 caused adrenal gland atrophy [102,107, 123,124,126] or accumulation of oil red O positive clefts in the cytoplasm of adrenocortical cells [102,123,125,129]. Eye abnormalities including cataract [108,114,128] a flecked retina [108,123,128] atrophy of the optic nerve and the nerve fiber and ganglion cell layers of the retina [122,123] were present in some patients.

### 3.4. Biochemical abnormalities and diagnosis

The metabolic abnormalities in patients with MFP-2 deficiency directly reflect the physiological importance of this enzyme for the degradation of certain substrates. The elevated levels of bile acid intermediates, pristanic acid and its precursor phytanic acid in most patients confirm that these branched chain compounds are metabolised via MFP-2. Although it was originally assumed that MFP-1 would be involved in the degradation of straight chain compounds, the elevation of VLCFA and the depletion of C₂₂:₆n-3 in plasma of MFP-2-deficient patients proofed that also these substrates are handled by MFP-2 [35,57]. Furthermore, increased levels of LTB4 and LTE4 in urine of these patients indicate that leukotrienes require MFP-2 for their metabolic inactivation/ degradation [135].

Since all these metabolic alterations also occur in patients with peroxisome biogenesis disorders, they do not allow for a differential diagnosis. Only the normal content of plasmalogens in erythrocytes of MFP-2-deficient patients unequivocally distinguishes them from patients with a peroxisome biogenesis disorder, which display a marked depletion of these ether lipids [136]. Besides measurement of β-oxidation substrates in body fluids, β-oxidation studies with cultured fibroblasts of MFP-2-deficient patients are of great diagnostic value. Furthermore, they appear to be the best predictor for life expectancy [122].

#### 3.4.1. Bile acid intermediates

Theoretically, one expects increased levels of 24E-trihydroxycholestenoyl-CoA in patients with a complete deficiency of MFP-2 or with a deficiency of the hydratase domain whereas a deficiency in the dehydrogenase domain would cause an accumulation of 24R,25R-varanoyl-CoA (Fig. 6). However, analysis of the accumulating bile acid intermediates in different MFP-2-deficient patients revealed a more complicated picture [118,130]: (1) in two patients with complete MFP-2 deficiency almost exclusively 24S,25S-varanic acid accumulates in one patient [130], whereas normal bile acids were found in the other one [137]; (2) in two patients with a same mutation in the hydratase domain of MFP-2, the levels of di- and trihydroxycholostanoic acid were normal. In this case, it should be noted that a very low level of the full length protein was still detectable by Western blot analysis [98], 3) in patients with a dysfunction of the dehydrogenase domain not only 24R,25R- but also 24R,25S-varanic acid was present [130].

Most of these findings can be explained if the following conversions, which might not function optimally, are assumed: MFP-1 hydrates 24E-trihydroxycholestenoyl-CoA and the formed 24S,25S-varanoyl-CoA is converted into 24S,25R-varanoyl-CoA by α-methylacyl-CoA racemase. This stereoisomer can be further dehydrogenated by MFP-1, resulting in the formation of the mature bile acids, cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid [50,63]. The racemase enzyme may also act on 24R,25R-varanoyl-CoA explaining the formation of 24R,25S-varanic acid in patients with an isolated dehydrogenase defect (Fig. 6). In addition mature bile acids can be formed through MFP-1 by chain shortening of 24S-hydroxycholesterol released from brain and via a microsomal pathway that bypasses peroxisomal β-oxidation [138].

In order to distinguish between a complete MFP-2 deficiency and an isolated hydratase deficiency using a biochemical approach, a method was developed to measure the dehydrogenase activity independent of the hydratase activity [139]. In this assay, the human hydratase domain of MFP-2 expressed in yeast is added to fibroblast homogenates of patients. Dehydrogenase activity, measured using 24E-trihydroxycholestenoyl-CoA as a substrate, will not be observed in homogenates of patients with complete MFP-2 deficiency or isolated dehydrogenase deficiency, but will be present in patients with isolated hydratase deficiency.

### 4. MFP-2-deficient mice

MFP-2 knockout mice were generated by deleting the first three exons of the mouse MFP-2 gene [59]. Extensive analyses confirmed the absence of MFP-2 transcripts and protein, and the loss of both enzymatic activities (hydratase and dehydrogenase). In addition, a mouse line was generated with a complete block of peroxisomal β-oxidation [140,141], by inbreeding the MFP-2 mouse line with previously generated MFP-1 knockout mice [60]. In the latter knockout mice no major phenotypic changes have been documented thus far, except the blunting of the peroxisome proliferation response after administration of peroxisome proliferators [60].

#### 4.1. Phenotype at birth

At birth MFP-2⁻/⁻ mice were normal without signs of intrauterine growth retardation or hypotonia, which is in contrast to Pex5p-deficient mice, a mouse model for Zellweger syndrome. As in Pex5 knockout mice, macrocephaly or other dysmorphic
features were absent [142]. In contrast, $MFP-1^{-/-} MFP-2^{-/-}$ mice displayed a variable growth retardation at birth with body weights ranging between 66 and 90% of the $MFP-1^{-/-} MFP-2^{+/+}$ pups [140]. Approximately 50% of the double knockout pups were severely hypotonic, less active, did not feed and died within 24 h after birth.

No neocortical neuronal migration abnormalities were found in MFP-2 and MFP-1/MFP-2-deficient mice. This was unexpected in light of the reports on MFP-2-deficient patients (see above) and the cytoarchitectonic abnormalities that are observed in the cortex and olivary nucleus of Pex5p-deficient mice [142]. The similarity in clinical presentation of Zellweger and MFP-2-deficient patients contrasts with the difference in phenotype of Pex5 and MFP-2 knockout mice. Redundant activity by MFP-1 may partly explain the absence of hypotonia in MFP-2 knockout mice but does not account for the absence of cytoarchitectonic abnormalities in MFP-2-deficient mouse brain. Based on correlations between biochemical and morphological changes in patients with a deficiency of MFP-2 or with a peroxisome biogenesis disorder, a pathogenic role for the elevated VLCFA levels has been proposed [143–145]. However, since the levels of cerotic acid ($C_{26:0}$) were elevated to the same extent in brain phospholipids of newborn MFP-2 and MFP-1/MFP-2 knockout mice as in peroxisome-deficient Pex5 knockout mice, the mouse data do not support the hypothesis that increased levels of $C_{26:0}$ or the inactivity of peroxisomal β-oxidation on their own induce cytoarchitectonic abnormalities in brain.

Together, these results indicate that in the mouse the inactivity of peroxisomal β-oxidation during embryonic development is less harmful than in man. It is possible that other peroxisomal pathways in the mouse can dispose of substrates that depend on MFP-2 for their degradation in man. Alternatively, these substances might be less toxic to the mouse brain.

### 4.2. Phenotype of suckling mice

From postnatal day two on, MFP-2-deficient mice were markedly growth retarded. Weight gain was particularly low during the lactation period resulting in an average 50% reduction of body weight in comparison to wild-type littermates. Approximately 30–40% of $MFP-2^{-/-}$ mice grew only marginally and died between postnatal day 2 and 12 [59]. Again, the phenotype of the double MFP-1/MFP-2-deficient mice was clearly worse than that of the single MFP-2 knockout mice since almost none of them survived the first 3 weeks [140]. In light of the absence of a phenotype in MFP-1 knockout mice, these data suggest that certain substrates can redundantly be degraded by MFP-1 and MFP-2.

When the composition of bile acids was analysed in single and double MFP knockout mice [146], the expected increase of immature $C_{27}$ bile acids and depletion of $C_{24}$ bile acids was found in liver and bile, with a slightly higher $C_{27}/C_{24}$ ratio in double knockouts as compared to single MFP-2 knockouts. More surprisingly, the $C_{27}$ bile acids were not conjugated during the lactation period, leaving only a small pool of conjugated $C_{24}$ bile acids available to exert micellarizing functions in the intestine. In mice, this is of particular importance during the lactation period for digestion of the lipid-rich milk. Indeed, the colon content of suckling single and double knockouts was clearly different from the respective controls in that it was pale and bulky, had a more yellowish fluid appearance and contained more undigested residues. Administration of cholic acid to the pregnant dams and during lactation could not prevent the death of suckling MFP-2-deficient mice (Huyghe S., unpublished results). This is in contrast to cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase knockout mice, for which survival past the lactation period depended on the supplementation of cholic acid to the chow of the nursing mothers [147].

Intriguingly, double MFP-1/MFP-2 knockout mice lost peroxisomes from their hepatocytes in the postnatal period and developed steatotic livers and mitochondrial abnormalities [141]. Since this did neither occur in single MFP-1, nor in single MFP-2 knockouts, this again suggests some important redundant function of the two multifunctional proteins.

### 4.3. Phenotype in adulthood

The growth curve of MFP-2 knockout mice in the post-weaning period was normal but they did not catch up with the wild type mice [59]. From about 1 month on, the MFP-2 knockout mice developed cramping reflexes of the limbs upon lifting them by their tail [148], which further evolved in diminished motoric capacities leading to immobility and death before the age of 6 months. The major organs, including liver, appeared macroscopically and microscopically normal, except for testes, eyes and central nervous system where clear pathologies were seen. In plasma, the peroxisomal β-oxidation substrates, VLCFA and pristanic acid and its precursor phytanic acid were elevated 2- to 10-fold [148].

#### 4.3.1. Testis

Female MFP-2 knockouts showed a reduced fertility but male knockout mice were completely infertile [97]. Spermatogenesis was already severely affected at 5 weeks and germ cells gradually disappeared from the tubuli seminiferi whereas interstitial Leydig cells looked normal. Already at the age of 10 days, neutral lipid droplets were selectively accumulating in the Sertoli cells of the seminiferous tubules [97]. These neutral lipid inclusions became larger with age, reaching several μm of diameter (Fig. 7A, B). Testes of 5-month-old MFP-2 knockouts were characterized by a complete fatty degeneration and obliteration of the seminiferous tubules. According to histological analyses, the huge lipid droplets contained triglycerides and cholesterol esters, which was confirmed by increased levels of these compounds in testis as measured by biochemical techniques [97]. Peroxisomal β-oxidation substrates, like VLCFA and pristanic acid, doubled in these neutral lipids compared to the levels in heterozygous littermates. On the other hand a severe lack of the polyunsaturated fatty acid, C22:5n-6, known to be enriched in rodent testis, was found. C22:5n-6, like its counterpart C22:6n-3, depends on peroxisomal β-oxidation for its synthesis. It is not clear yet whether the early

Panels A, E, G are sections of wild type mice, all the other panels represent $MFP-2^{-/-}$ mice.

spermatogenesis defect is caused by the lipid excess in Sertoli cells or whether additional mechanisms, e.g., the depletion of the polyunsaturated fatty acids are involved.

### 4.3.2. Eyes

$MFP-2$ knockout mice showed degeneration and vacuolisation of the layer of outer receptor segments from the age of 6 weeks, and at 19 weeks the retina was atrophic (Huyghe S., unpublished data, Fig. 7C, E). Concomitantly, the pigment epithelium accumulated lipids, partly in the form of small, irregularly shaped and homogeneously osmiophilic bodies and partly in the form of typical phagolysosomal vacuoles. The nuclei of the receptor cells were still visible, even after the outer segments had vanished. Despite this atrophy, which seemingly
comprised all layers of the retina, the structure of the optic nerve and the number of its myelinated fibres were perfectly normal (Fig. 7D). This indicated that at least the ganglion cell layer was not affected. After 10 weeks, macroscopically visible cataracts developed in the lens of MFP-2 knockout mice (Fig. 7F).

### 4.3.3. Nervous system

Extensive investigations were performed to understand the origin of the fatal motoric abnormalities of MFP-2 knockout mice [148]. Since increased levels of branched chain fatty acids in Refsum disease and α-methylacyl-CoA racemase-deficient patients cause peripheral neuropathies, the neuromuscular system was analysed by light and electron microscopy and by nerve crushing and regeneration experiments, but no anomalies were found [148]. Also demyelination and loss of Purkinje cells, both neuropathologic features that are seen in patients with peroxisomal disorders, could account for the motor problems. However, no clearcut changes in myelin content or Purkinje cell numbers were detected in MFP-2 knockout mice.

Further histological examination of the brain revealed four different anomalies in MFP-2 knockout brain, i.e., accumulations of neutral lipids, overexpression of catalase and severe astro- and microgliosis [148].

The lipid inclusions were most abundant in Bergmann glia fibers of the cerebellar cortex, in fibrous astrocytes close to blood vessels, and in the ependymal lining of the cerebral ventricles (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th) (Fig. 7G, H) and of the central canal of the spinal cord. They were first visible at the age of 4 weeks and became larger and more abundant into adulthood. These inclusions differed from those in Sertoli cells in shape and osmiophilic staining. The lipid droplets most probably consisted of cholesterylesters since these compounds were about 5-fold increased in cerebellum of MFP-2 knockout mice [148]. A vast 20-fold increase of C₂₆:₀ levels was found, but these were present in the phospholipid fraction and could thus not account for the lipid storage. The incorporation of branched chain fatty acids in lipids of the central nervous system was only marginally increased as compared to wild type mice. Quite surprisingly, no differences in C₂₂:6n-3 concentration was found between wild type and MFP-2 knockout brain at the age of 5 months, although a decrease of this fatty acid was observed at birth. This was ascribed to small amounts of this fatty acid in the food and the economic way by which the brain conserves DHA levels when it senses a decrease in DHA availability or concentration [148].

Intense astrogliosis and microgliosis were observed in the grey matter of the brain and spinal cord [148]. Although these are very unspecific reactions of the central nervous system that can be triggered by numerous conditions, the activation of astro- and microglia in MFP-2 knockout mouse brain is a sign of lesions in specific brain regions. Astroglial degeneration was noted but this did not affect neuronal survival. Histological and biochemical experiments documented a strong increase of catalase protein expression in astrocytes of all brain areas, but this was not accompanied by increased levels of catalase transcripts.

These observations demonstrate that MFP-2 plays an indispensable role to maintain the lipid homeostasis and integrity of several tissues in adult mice. It is quite surprising that no anomalies were found in liver, the tissue with the most extensive peroxisomal metabolic activities. The liver phenotype of MFP-2 knockout mice is very different from acyl-CoA oxidase (Acox1) knockout mice in which microvesicular steatosis [149] and PPARα mediated gene inductions were reported [79]. Since both of these phenomena do occur in double MFP-1/MFP-2 knockout mice [141], it seems likely that the activity of MFP-1 protects the mouse liver in MFP-2-deficient mice from these events. The cell types that accumulate lipids seem to have some features in common despite their location in different organs. Sertoli cells, retinal pigment epithelium cells and astrocytes all have a metabolic supportive function for other cell types, i.e., respectively, the germ cells, the photoreceptors and neurons. In each case it was reported that the guardian cells synthesize essential lipid compounds or degrade bioactive lipids for their neighbouring cell type. The precise role of MFP-2 in these different cell types remains to be resolved.
