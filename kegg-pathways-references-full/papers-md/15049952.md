### Introduction

Autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD) is the most common organ-specific autoimmune disorder resulting in dysfunction (hyperfunction, hypofunction or both) of the thyroid gland. The presently accepted classification of AITD, listed in Table 1, includes chronic autoimmune thyroiditis or Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT) and its variants (painless postpartum and sporadic thyroiditis), autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis or primary myxoedema and Graves’ disease (GD). Investigation of the AITDs has focussed on determining their pathogenesis and origin in order to develop specific aetiologically based therapeutic measures. Genetic and environmental factors appear to interact leading to appearance of autoantigens and accumulation of professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the thyroid. Consequently, due to loss of immune tolerance, autoreactive immune cells activated by APCs, invade the thyroid gland interacting with thyroid cells in a battle for survival. The activation of apoptotic pathways through surface receptors and ligands is of great significance for the outcome of this battle and thus the clinical expression of AITD. The apoptotic pathways are regulated at several levels and normally remain inactive but blocking can be overcome after cell exposure to certain cytokines produced locally by the activated T lymphocytes. It is likely that the regulation of apoptosis during this interaction between the invading lymphocytes and the defending thyroid cells, may play an important role for the clinical expression of AITD.

In this article, current evidence regarding the mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of AITD is reviewed. Particular emphasis is given to the role of iodine in inducing thyroid autoimmunity and, more importantly, to the role of apoptosis in determining the diverse clinical outcome following the disturbance in immune tolerance and the inappropriate activation of the immune system against the thyroid gland.

### An overview of the immune regulation

#### Immune cell activation

The major role of the immune system is to discriminate between self- and foreign antigens. Under physiological conditions, self-antigens are tolerated and immune response is aimed at foreign antigens. On antigenic stimulation, CD4+ T helper precursor cells differentiate into two distinct subpopulations, Th1 and Th2. Th1 cells secrete IL-2, IFN-γ and TNF-α, which regulate the cell-mediated immune response and the induction of tissue damage through activation of cytolytic cells or other cytotoxic mechanisms (Mosmann & Sad, 1996; Blüher et al., 1999). Th2 cells on the other hand, mainly secrete IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10 and are activated to provide help to B lymphocytes for specific immunoglobulin production (Mosmann & Sad, 1996; Blüher et al., 1999).

T lymphocytes recognize antigenic molecules, presented to them by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) bearing APCs (dendritic cells and macrophage subtypes). Activation of T lymphocytes, through the interaction with APCs, requires two distinct signals. The first is provided by the T lymphocyte receptor (TCR) binding with its antigen presented on MHC and provides specificity. The additional or co-stimulatory signal is provided by cell-surface molecules expressed on APCs. Of the known co-stimulatory molecules, the family of proteins termed B7 appears to be the most potent (Matsuoka et al., 1996). At least two B7 proteins exist, B7·1 (CD80) and B7·2 (CD70). B7·1 co-stimulates and induces Th1 cell production, while B7·2 co-stimulates and induces Th2 cell production (Kuchroo et al., 1995; Battifora et al., 1998; Salmaso et al., 2002). B7·1 and B7·2 interact with their counter receptors CD28 and cytolytic T lymphocyte associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4; Azuma et al., 1993; Freeman et al., 1993). Interaction of B7·1 or B7·2 with CD28 molecules expressed on resting T lymphocytes delivers positive signals activating these cells. CTLA-4 expressed on activated T lymphocytes competes with CD28 for the co-stimulatory receptors B7·1 and B7·2. Preferential binding of B7 molecules to CTLA-4 conveys negative regulation, inducing anergy (Fig. 1; Krummel & Allison, 1995; Weetman, 2003).

A native soluble form of CTLA-4 (sCTLA-4), resulting from alternative gene splicing, was found to be present in human serum (Oaks et al., 2000). There is evidence suggesting that this truncated receptor is capable of binding B7 family molecules yet its functional role remains unknown.

Two newly identified pairs of ligand-receptors have also been implicated in the delivery of the stimulatory signal. The positive regulatory co-receptor inducible co-stimulator (ICOS) binds

(Schwartz, 1993; Weetman & McGregor, 1994). Clonal anergy on the other hand, may be achieved when mature immune cells bind antigen in the absence of co-stimulatory molecules, leading to functional inactivation or incomplete T lymphocyte activation and desensitization rather than deletion (Schwartz, 1993, 2003).

The importance of central tolerance as an autoimmunity control mechanism has been brought back into attention with the isolation of the novel AIRE gene, a transcription factor primarily expressed on thymic medullary epithelial cells and monocyte-dendritic cells in the thymus (Heino et al., 1999). Mutations of AIRE are considered responsible for the pathogenesis of autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 1 (APS-1) or APECED syndrome (Nagamine et al., 1997; Finnish–German APECED Consortium, 1997). APS-1 is a monogenic disorder characterized by the breakdown of tolerance to several organ-specific self-antigens probably due to thymic failure to delete autoreactive T lymphocytes (Liston et al., 2003). Studies on AIRE-deficient mice have shown that AIRE may regulate autoimmunity by promoting the ectopic expression of peripheral tissue-restricted antigens in thymic medullary epithelial cells (Anderson et al., 2002). These mice show almost complete failure to delete certain organ-specific cells in the thymus suggesting a role for AIRE protein thyroglobulin in the induction and maintenance of tolerance. Because thyroglobulin has been found to be expressed in the thymic medulla, AIRE’s contribution to tolerance of thyroid specific autoantigens may be important (Derbinski et al., 2001).

Peripheral tolerance could be achieved through the interaction of APCs with autoreactive CTLA-4-bearing T lymphocytes. sCTLA-4 may also regulate peripheral tolerance. Oaks et al. (2000) proposed that, on resting cells, sCTLA-4 is more prominent and may bind B7 expressed on APCs and block B7–CD28 interactions, interfering with T lymphocyte co-stimulation. On the other hand, inhibition of B7–CTLA-4 interactions by sCTLA-4 on activated T cells (where transmembrane CTLA-4 expression is induced) may block CTLA-4-mediated negative signal of T lymphocyte responses.

PD-1 could also be involved in the maintenance of peripheral tolerance. PD-L1 expression on APCs may regulate the organ-specific tolerance in normal tissue by vetoing the effects of potential autoreactive cells (Dong et al., 2002). PD-L1 and PD-L2 function to inhibit T cell activation and may further be responsible for differential contributions to cellular and humoral

Mechanisms of tolerance and tolerance escape

Prevention of self-reactivity depends on mechanisms controlling the autoreactive T lymphocytes. Such control mechanisms include those of adaptive (central and peripheral) tolerance induction and clonal anergy (Ramsdell & Fowlkes, 1990; Schwartz, 2003). Central and peripheral adaptive tolerance induction involve a similar mechanism, but the first occurs mainly in the thymus. Immature T and B lymphocytes bind antigens in the absence of co-stimulatory molecules or in the presence of co-inhibitory molecules, resulting in T lymphocyte deletion through apoptosis
immune responses (Brown *et al.*, 2003; Youngnak *et al.*, 2003)  
PD-1-deficient mice are characterized by a predisposition to  
autoimmunity suggesting a defect in peripheral tolerance  
(Nishimura *et al.*, 1999, 2001). PD-L1 and PD-L2 might also  
have different functions in regulating type 1 and type 2 responses.  
Th1 cells can upregulate PD-L1 on macrophage populations,  
whereas Th2 cells may enhance PD-L2 expression on inflammatory  
macrophages (Loke & Allison, 2003).  

On the other hand, ICOS contribution to self-tolerance also  
needs further investigation. ICOS is expressed on activated T  
lymphocytes and binding to its ligand stimulates both cellular and  
humoral immune responses (Guo *et al.*, 2001; Smith *et al.*,  
2003). Furthermore, it is thought that ICOS may sustain rather  
than initiate T lymphocyte responses. However, the exact role of  
these newly discovered co-stimulatory molecules in peripheral  
tolerance and/or activation of immune responses remains to be  
clarified.  

If, however, one or more of the above mechanisms of immune  
tolerance fails, immune cells may establish a self-directed immune  
reaction so intense and vigorous that it damages tissues. The  
result of this immune system reaction is the development of autoimmune diseases.  

## The phenotypic characteristics of AITDs  

An accepted classification of thyroid-specific autoimmune diseases is shown in Table 1 and includes the various types of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis and GD (Pearce *et al.*, 2003).  

Chronic autoimmune thyroiditis is divided into HT and atrophic thyroiditis, based on clinical findings. HT is characterized by the presence of goitre, thyroid autoantibodies against thyroid peroxidase (TPO) and thyroglobulin (Tg) in serum and varying degrees of thyroid dysfunction. It is considered to be the result of immune response which leads to aberrant infiltration of autoantigen-specific lymphoid cells and destruction of thyroid follicles. The intrathyroidal lymphocytes are both T and B lymphocytes, with Th-1 subtype predominating, although Th2 cells are also present (Roura-Mir *et al.*, 1997; Battifora *et al.*, 1998; Blüher *et al.*, 1999). Lymphocytes occasionally form germinal centres in and around the follicular cells. The final outcome is hypothyroidism as a result of thyroid cell destruction.  

On the other hand, atrophic thyroiditis is characterized by a small (atrophic) thyroid gland with lymphocytic infiltration and fibrous tissue replacing normal thyroid parenchyma and presents with clinical hypothyroidism. Antagonist antibodies to the TSH receptor are present in 20–50% of patients with atrophic thyroiditis, while such antibodies are also found in up to 10% of patients with goitrous thyroiditis and overt hypothyroidism (Orgiazzi, 2000). Another variant of autoimmune thyroiditis is painless (silent) thyroiditis with its sporadic and postpartum forms (Stagnaro-Green, 2002). These are usually transient but  

may recur, especially the postpartum form with subsequent pregnancies (Pearce *et al.*, 2003). Silent thyroiditis is described as painless goitrous lymphocytic thyroiditis with antithyroid antibodies and a triphasic course with mild thyrotoxicosis followed by hypothyroidism and return to euthyroid state.  

GD is characterized by follicular hyperplasia, patchy lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid, not as massive as in HT, and occasional formation of lymphoid germinal centres (Armengol *et al.*, 2001). The majority of thyroid infiltrating T lymphocytes act mainly as CD4+ Th2 cells although Th1 type cells are also present (Roura-Mir *et al.*, 1997). GD is due to antibodies to the TSH receptor, which stimulate thyroid growth and function (Rees Smith *et al.*, 1988; Rapoport *et al.*, 1998). In a recent study, isolation of thyroid-stimulating monoclonal antibodies produced by lymphocytes from a patient with GD was made possible, a discovery that may advance our understanding of GD (Sanders *et al.*, 2003).  

Both GD and HT can present with similar findings including lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid and anti-Tg and anti-TPO autoantibodies in the serum. The clinical course may also fluctuate between the two disorders. This observation can lead to the assumption that HT and GD may have a partially shared pathogenesis.  

### Pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity  

#### Genetic susceptibility  

Thyroid autoimmune diseases are regarded as polygenic disorders resulting from the combination of a genetic predisposition in conjunction with an environmental trigger. In animal models there are strong indications that genetically determined immune defects lead to intolerance toward presented self-antigens (Ruwhof & Drexhage, 2001). Genetic constitution, including both major MHC and non-MHC genes, determines how prone an individual is to autoimmune diseases. Genes may influence disease in two ways. They may be essential for disease development, or simply increase the susceptibility of the individual to develop the disease. The most important genes are those in the MHC region but other non-MHC genes with a role in regulation of the metabolism and susceptibility of the target tissue may also be involved. Such genes include inflammatory cytokine genes (Badenhoop *et al.*, 1992; Hunt *et al.*, 2001) and co-stimulatory molecule genes (CTLA-4; Yanagawa *et al.*, 1995; Kotsa *et al.*, 1997; Einarsdottir *et al.*, 2003), while TCR variable region genes and immunoglobulin genes do not seem to contribute to AITD susceptibility (Fakhfakh *et al.*, 1999; Pickerill *et al.*, 1993).  

The recently discovered AIRE gene may also harbour risk polymorphisms, although studies to date failed to correlate any of the two most frequent AIRE mutations with predisposition to isolated autoimmune endocrinopathies, including AITDs. Nevertheless, these studies were confined to two mutations of the many  so far identified, which were also so rare that any susceptibility effect to AITD could not be assessed (Meyer *et al.*, 2001; Nithiyananthan *et al.*, 2002). Therefore other AIRE mutants cannot be ruled out as candidates for genetic susceptibility to AITD.

A large number of studies have reported an increased frequency of different MHC gene alleles among HT and GD patients depending on their ethnic origin (Hunt *et al.*, 2001; Ban *et al.*, 2002; Vaidya *et al.*, 2002; Villanueva *et al.*, 2002). Polymorphisms of CTLA-4 or a closely linked gene (Yanagawa *et al.*, 1995; Kotsa *et al.*, 1997; Einarsdottir *et al.*, 2003) and the newly implicated Pendred syndrome (PDS) gene (Kacem *et al.*, 2003), have also been found in HT and GD patients. However, data from genome-wide scans searching for AITD susceptibility candidate genes indicate that the only real evidence is that for HLA (DR3) and CTLA-4 (Weetman, 2003). Thus, these two major contributors in antigen presentation processes appear to be associated with the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity.

### Environmental factors

Environmental factors postulated to induce autoimmune diseases include iodine, drugs (amiodarone, IFN-α) and infectious organisms. It has been suggested that antibodies produced in response to certain infectious agents (i.e. *Yersinia enterocolitica*) may also react with human cell proteins, due to their structural resemblance (mechanism of molecular mimicry; Baker, 1997; Corapcioglu *et al.*, 2002; Strieder *et al.*, 2003). However, other studies suggest that molecular mimicry does not play a role in the initiation or induction of autoimmune thyroid diseases (Tomer & Davies, 1993). Other precipitating or predisposing factors include stress (Kung, 1995; Matos-Santos *et al.*, 2001), which has also been demonstrated to affect the outcome of antithyroid drug treatment in GD (Fukao *et al.*, 2003), sex steroids, smoking (Prummel & Wiersinga, 1993) and trauma.

### The role of iodine

Iodine is considered to be an important environmental agent known to increase the risk of thyroid autoimmunity. Several studies support a role for iodine in the initiation and promotion of AITD. Thus, epidemiological studies have shown that appearance of thyroid autoantibodies has been associated with salt iodination in iodine-deficient regions (Tsatsoulis *et al.*, 1999; Premawardhana *et al.*, 2000; Lind *et al.*, 2002; Zois *et al.*, 2003). In addition, animal studies have confirmed that high iodine intake accelerates autoimmune thyroiditis in autoimmune-prone animal models (Mooij *et al.*, 1993; Bagchi *et al.*, 1995; Rasooly *et al.*, 1996).

Several mechanisms have been suggested for the induction of thyroid autoimmunity by excess iodine. Thyroglobulin (Tg) iodination can increase its immunogenicity by altering stereochemical structure and leading to the production of novel iodine-containing determinants and the loss of some and appearance of other cryptic epitopes (Rasooly *et al.*, 1998; Saboori *et al.*, 1998). All of these may enhance the Tg presentation by APCs and increase the affinity of the TCR for the Tg, leading to specific T lymphocyte activation.

Another mechanism is toxic destruction of thyroid cells possibly through the generation of oxygen radicals (Bagchi *et al.*, 1995). Excessive amounts of the iodide ion are oxidized by TPO producing large amounts of oxidative intermediates and these molecules are capable of oxidizing membrane lipids and proteins, thus damaging thyroid cell membranes (Burikhanov & Matsuzaki, 2000; Vitale *et al.*, 2000).

There is also evidence for direct stimulation effects of iodine on macrophages, DCs, B and T lymphocytes. Enhanced macrophage myeloperoxidase activity, augmentation of dendritic cell maturation, increase in the number of circulating T lymphocytes and stimulation of immunoglobulin production are some of the possible iodine effects on the immune system (Rose *et al.*, 2002).

### Mechanisms of thyroid autoimmunity

The pathogenetic mechanisms of thyroid autoimmunity have been studied in detail in animal models that spontaneously develop autoimmune thyroiditis. Such studies have shown that the pathogenesis of thyroid autoimmunity is a multistep process (Ruwhof & Drexhage, 2001). In the early phases, two immune processes take place. In the first stage an increased number of intrathyroidal APCs appears to be the most prominent sign of the initiation of an autoimmune reaction (Voorbij *et al.*, 1990). Induction of APC influx in the thyroid of susceptible individuals may result from inflammatory signals following damage or necrosis of target cells by toxins, viral or bacterial infection, or iodine excess. Alterations in the metabolism or the microenvironment of thyroid cells may also be an inducing factor for APC accumulation in the thyroid. During this early phase the APCs migrate and present thyroid autoantigens to T helper lymphocytes in the draining lymph nodes of the thyroid gland.

In the next stage, lymphocytes interact with the presented autoantigens. During this phase, peripheral tolerance mechanisms described above and their regulation by co-stimulatory molecules is important. If immune tolerance is lost, the outcome of this interaction is the activation of antigen-specific T helper lymphocytes. These in turn stimulate, through different cytokine production, the cellular immune response and/or the humoral immune response via B lymphocytes. Thus, instead of reinforcing tolerance, the APCs generate an autoimmune reaction. Initially, the production of autoreactive T lymphocytes and antibodies takes place in the draining lymph nodes, but later lymphoid tissue develops locally in the thyroid itself. Thyroid cells may also express MHC II molecules that are required for antigen presentation to CD4+ T lymphocytes and can also act as APCs

© 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, *Clinical Endocrinology*, **60**, 397–409(Bottazzo *et al.*, 1983; Sospedra *et al.*, 1995). This expression of MHC II molecules on thyrocytes may be the consequence of cytokine (IFN-γ) production by activated T lymphocytes infiltrating the thyroid gland (Todd *et al.*, 1985). Earlier studies indicated that thyroid cells were unable to express B7·1 or B7·2 molecules (Tandon *et al.*, 1994a; Matsuoka *et al.*, 1996). However, Battifora *et al.* (1998) found that B7·1 is frequently expressed on thyroid follicular cells in HT patients. CD28 expression by a large number of thyroid infiltrating lymphocytes could, through the interaction with B7·1 on thyroid cells, result in the induction of autoreactive T lymphocyte activation (Battifora *et al.*, 1998). Another role for thyroid cells may involve the recruitment of immune cells in the thyroid gland, through the expression of chemoattractant molecules (Weetman *et al.*, 1990). This expression was also found to be induced by cytokines (IL-1α and IFN-γ) in cultured thyroid cells (Kemp *et al.*, 2003). T lymphocytes can then be restimulated by MHC II expressed on thyrocytes, thus leading to the continuation of the autoimmune process.

Studies regarding sCTLA-4 expression in AITD patients have reported controversial results. Oaks & Hallett (2000) report that sCTLA-4 levels are elevated among patients with AITD, while Ueda *et al.* (2003) have found reduced mRNA levels of sCTLA-4 in subjects with a CTLA-4 allelic variant, associated with GD and HT disease susceptibility.

In a final phase, the generated autoreactive T and B lymphocytes accumulate in large numbers and infiltrate the thyroid parenchyma. The latter is then turned into a battlefield in which thyrocytes interact with infiltrating lymphocytes, in a struggle for survival. The outcome of this battle will determine the clinical phenotype of the disease. Apoptosis appears to play a major role in this final stage (Andrikoula & Tsatsoulis, 2001; Tsatsoulis, 2002).

### Role of apoptosis in the clinical expression of AITD

#### Apoptotic pathways in the thyroid and their regulation

Apoptosis or programmed cell death involves the sequential activation of a series of proteolytic enzymes known as caspases that progressively digest the cell and its genetic material. The caspase-cascade is activated by two pathways; the death receptor and the mitochondrial pathway. Specific signals such as ligands that bind to death receptors or withdrawal of growth factors and trophic hormones may activate the apoptotic machinery. The best studied receptor-mediated apoptotic pathway is the Fas/Fas Ligand (FasL) system. Fas is a type I transmembrane protein and belongs to the TNF receptor superfamily. FasL is a type II transmembrane protein that on ligation with the Fas receptor induces apoptosis on Fas-expressing target cells (Fig. 2; Suda *et al.*, 1993; Nagata & Golstein, 1995).

![Diagram](https://i.imgur.com/yourimage.png)

**Fig. 2** Components of the Fas and DR4/DR5 receptor-mediated apoptotic pathways. On ligation of FasL, Fas receptor trimerizes and recruits, via its death domain, an adapter protein known as Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD). FADD recruits and interacts with procaspase 8. Formation of the Fas-FADD-procaspase 8 complex facilitates the autocleavage and activation of procaspase 8. Caspase 8 cleaves and activates caspase 3 and other downstream effector caspases. This caspase-cascade activation finally leads to apoptosis. TRAIL ligates to its receptors DR4 and DR5, which recruit an unknown adapter. Procaspace 10 is also recruited and autoactivation of caspase 10 occurs. Consequently, caspase 10 cleaves and activates caspase 8, thus initiating the apoptotic caspase-cascade. Bcl-2 family members may act as regulators of apoptosis.

Soluble forms of Fas (sFas) and FasL (sFasL) have also been detected. sFas lacking the transmembrane domain of its receptor results from alternative splicing of Fas mRNA. sFas can inhibit Fas/FasL interaction and protect target cells from Fas-induced apoptosis (Cheng *et al.*, 1994). sFasL results from FasL cleavage by a metalloproteinase (Kayagaki *et al.*, 1995) and it is postulated to induce apoptosis on Fas-expressing cells *in vitro*. However, its *in vivo* role remains unclear. There are indications that sFasL production, through transmembrane FasL cleavage, may down-regulate FasL's killing activity and prevent suicidal death through Fas/FasL interaction among neighbouring cells (Suda *et al.*, 1997).

The TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a more recently characterized member of the TNF family of proteins that exists in both membrane-bound and soluble forms and has the closest resemblance to FasL. TRAIL induces apoptosis by engaging its receptors, TRAIL-R1 (DR4) and TRAIL-R2 (DR5), via a caspase-dependent pathway (Fig. 2; Pan *et al.*, 1997a, 1997b).

The Fas/FasL system plays an important role in normal immune regulation by removal of autoreactive T and B lymphocytes at the end of an immune response (Van Parijs *et al.*, 1998). These molecules can also be used by immune effector cells to kill targets. A variety of cell types, including the thyroid cell, constitutively express Fas (Hammond *et al.*, 1997; Mitsiades *et al.*, 1998, 1999; Hiromatsu *et al.*, 1999b). The Fas pathway is, however, inhibited under normal conditions possibly by labile protein inhibitors (Arscott *et al.*, 1997; Mitsiades *et al.*, 1998). This inhibition may

be reversed during inflammation by the action of inflammatory cytokines. The optimal conditions for the induction of Fas-mediated apoptosis in thyroid cells require the presence of IFN-γ in combination with IL-1β or TNF-α (Bretz et al., 1999a; Wang et al., 2002).

The expression of FasL on thyroid cells is controversial. Normally, the expression of FasL is restricted, occurring only on activated lymphocytes and ‘immune-privileged’ sites such as the cornea, the testis and the anterior chamber of the eye (Griffith et al., 1995). However, under certain pathological conditions the thyroid cell can be induced to express FasL and to use FasL to influence its environment (Hiromatsu et al., 1999b; Giordano et al., 2001; Sera et al., 2001).

In vitro studies have also shown that TSH was able to inhibit Fas-mediated apoptosis, whereas withdrawal of TSH (Kawakami et al., 1996) resulted in the induction of apoptosis.

TRAIL death receptors DR4 and DR5 appear to be constitutively expressed on normal thyrocytes but their molecules become in vitro functional only in the presence of a protein synthesis inhibitor, which reduces labile inhibitors’ activity (Bretz et al., 1999b). In addition, inflammatory cytokines can induce functional expression of TRAIL pathway in thyroid cells (Bretz et al., 1999a; Bretz & Baker, 2001).

There are also indications that expression of antiapoptotic molecules such as Bcl-2, could be regulated in either thyroid cells or lymphocytes in an attempt to avoid apoptotic death (Giordano et al., 1997, 2001; Mitsiades et al., 1998).


## Apoptosis and clinical expression of AITD

In HT, increased apoptosis has been proposed as the mechanism for the thyroid cell destruction characteristic of the disease (Arscott & Baker, 1998). Histologically, HT is characterized by massive infiltration of lymphoid cells in or around thyroid follicular cells (Baker, 1997). In areas where intact follicular cells are observed in proximity to the infiltrating immune cells, thyroid cells appear apoptotic, suggesting immune-mediated destruction of these cells (Kotani et al., 1995). In contrast, in GD, the degree of lymphocyte infiltration in the thyroid is less and the rate of apoptosis in thyrocytes is low (Tanimoto et al., 1995).

There is some controversy regarding the mechanism of thyroid cell apoptotic death seen in HT. The prevailing view is that Fas-mediated thyroid cell apoptosis is induced by the infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes expressing FasL and Bcl-2 (Fig. 3a; Arscott & Baker, 1998; Mitsiades et al., 1998; Kawakami et al., 2000; Giordano et al., 2001). According to recent evidence, activation of the Fas pathway normally inhibited in thyroid cells is induced by a certain combination of proinflammatory cytokines released locally by the infiltrating lymphocytes (Giordano et al., 1997; Hiromatsu et al., 1999b). Predominating Th1 inflammatory cytokines (IFN-γ, TNF-α, IL-1β), which are produced due to


Fig. 3 Potential models for the role of Fas-mediated apoptosis in AITD. (a) Cytokines produced by activated intrathyroidal T lymphocytes induce the activation of the Fas pathway on thyroid cells leading to their apoptosis after interaction with FasL-bearing T lymphocytes or sFasL deriving from activated T lymphocytes. (b) Simultaneous expression of Fas and FasL on thyroid cells leads to their fratricidal demise. (c) Binding of thyroid cell surface FasL with Fas expressed on intrathyroidal T lymphocytes results in T lymphocyte apoptosis.

B7·1 co-stimulation of infiltrating lymphocytes by ‘professional’ APCs, seem to have an important role, enhancing thyroid cell susceptibility to apoptosis. Thyroid cells may also be capable of B7·1 expression, thus providing a co-stimulatory signal to T lymphocytes for Th1 cytokine production (Battifora et al., 1998). A recent study has shown a Th1 cytokine production pattern, not only in intrathyroidal but also in peripheral CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in HT patients (Mazziotti et al., 2003). Furthermore, Fas-mediated cell death was induced when thyroid cells were pre-treated with IFN-γ in combination with IL-1β or TNF-α (Bretz et al., 1999a; Wang et al., 2002).

An alternative hypothesis has been put forward by Giordano et al. (1997, 2001) who suggested that the apoptosis observed in the thyroid of patients with HT is a consequence of simultaneous expression of Fas and FasL by thyrocytes, resulting in fratricide among neighbouring cells (Fig. 3b). This model is based on the observation that FasL is constitutively expressed on thyrocytes and that IL-1β produced by infiltrating immune cells induces Fas expression on thyrocytes. This hypothesis is, however, at odds with a growing number of reports suggesting that Fas, and not FasL is normally expressed on thyrocytes (Arscott et al., 1997; Mitsiades et al., 1998, 1999).

Soluble forms of Fas and FasL could also have a role in HT pathogenesis. sFasL shed off from activated lymphocytes may induce apoptosis on Fas-expressing target cells (Martinez-Lorenzo *et al.*, 1996). On the other hand, sFas is found to be decreased in HT, so that the increased full-length membrane Fas may promote thyroid cell apoptosis (Shimaoka *et al.*, 1998). The expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 is also downregulated in the thyroid cells of patients with HT, creating a proapoptotic potential for thyroid cells (Andrikoula *et al.*, 2001; Giordano *et al.*, 2001).

Recent evidence also suggests that other ligand receptor pairs may contribute to thyroid cell apoptosis. Activated immune cells could, through the release of TNF-α and IL-1β, sensitize thyroid cells to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, thus leading to their destruction (Bretz *et al.*, 1999a; Bretz & Baker, 2001).

Mechanisms implicated in thyrocyte elimination in HT, apart from apoptotic death, might include exocytic granules containing perforin and granzyme B (Wu *et al.*, 1994; Talanian *et al.*, 1997) and complement activation. Involvement of the complement system has been described in both GD and HT even though HT and GD thyrocytes are relatively resistant to lysis by the membrane attack complex due to the expression of inhibitory proteins (Chiovato *et al.*, 1993; Tandon *et al.*, 1994b). In this case, complement activation may not directly kill thyroid cells but it can exacerbate the autoimmune process thus suggesting a role for the disease maintenance in human AITD (Tandon *et al.*, 1994b). Although these mechanisms cannot be overlooked, the weight of evidence suggests that their impact may not be as important as that of apoptosis, at least as far as the clinical expression of AITDs is concerned (Okosieme *et al.*, 2002).

Finally, the reduction or loss of intracellular communication may also contribute to thyroid cell destruction leading to hypothyroidism. In animal models of thyroid autoimmunity, a decreased assembly of connexins into gap junctions has been found and this is accompanied by deficient cell-to-cell communication (Green *et al.*, 1996, 1997) and their demise by a type of apoptosis called anoikis (Di Matola *et al.*, 2000).

In contrast to HT, which is characterized by thyroid cell destruction and hypothyroidism, GD is manifested by thyroid cell hyperplasia and hyperthyroidism, despite clear evidence of autoimmunity. Histologically, in GD the lymphocytic infiltration of the thyroid is milder and the number of apoptotic thyroid cells is low. This observation suggests that mechanisms for thyroid cell survival and active killing of infiltrating lymphocytes may be operative in GD. This in turn may be due to the different profile of cytokines secreted in the local microenvironment by different subsets of infiltrating lymphocytes. In GD, there appears to be a predominant production of Th2 type inflammatory cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10), in contrast to Th1 prevalence in HT, probably as a result of B7·2 co-stimulation of infiltrating lymphocytes (Mosmann & Sad, 1996; Roura-Mir *et al.*, 1997; Bretz *et al.*, 1999a; Stassi *et al.*, 2000).

Th2 cytokine predominance favours humoral immunity instead of cellular immunity, enhancing autoantibody production by B lymphocytes. Indeed, patients with GD produce high titres of IgG antibodies specific for the TSH receptor. These antibodies function like TSH by activating the receptor, causing thyroid cell hyperplasia and hyperfunction. The TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies may also play an antiapoptotic role, protecting thyroid cells from apoptosis. Indeed, both TSH and IgG from patients with GD decrease Fas expression in normal thyrocytes (Kawakami *et al.*, 1997, 2000). In addition, Th2 type cytokines may upregulate antiapoptotic molecules, including Bcl-2 protein and protect thyrocytes from apoptotic cell death (Mitsiades *et al.*, 2001; Nagayama *et al.*, 2003).

On the other hand, thyroid cells may also be capable of fighting off T lymphocytes via induced expression of death ligands such as FasL or TRAIL, which may kill intrathyroidal lymphocytes (Fig. 3c; Giordano *et al.*, 1997; Bretz & Baker, 2001). Soluble Fas may also play a role in the inhibition of the Fas/FasL system in patients with GD. Serum concentration of sFas is found to be increased in patients with GD compared to control subjects. sFas was also detected in the supernatant of cultured thyrocytes from patients with GD (Shimaoka *et al.*, 1998; Hiromatsu *et al.*, 1999a; Feldkamp *et al.*, 2001).

It appears that differences in the local microenvironment are crucial to the development of either GD or HT. The most important of these differences are summarized in Table 2 and include the different subsets of T lymphocytes accumulating in the thyroid and the different profile of cytokines that are secreted and that in turn influence the expression of death receptors, ligands, antiapoptotic molecules, inhibitory molecules and soluble agents. It seems highly possible that in GD all these parameters are regulated in a manner that promotes thyrocyte survival and hypertrophy, while leading to lymphocyte apoptosis. In HT, the microenvironment favors thyroid cell destruction by apoptosis induced by the invading cytotoxic immune cells.

The crucial role of the balance between Th1 vs. Th2 response in the divergent phenotypic expression of AITD is also supported by a recent clinical observation (Coles *et al.*, 1999). According to this report a significant number (1/3) of patients with multiple sclerosis develop GD after treatment with the humanized anti-CD52 monoclonal antibody Campath 1-H, aiming to deplete T lymphocytes and suppress cellular immunity. A possible explanation for this outcome is that T lymphocytes which reemerge after depletion are biased away from a Th1 to a Th2 phenotype, leading to the development of antibody-mediated GD (Weetman, 2003).

The subset of autoimmune atrophic thyroiditis with blocking anti-TSH receptor antibodies may be regarded as the opposite end to that of GD. Here again, predominance of humoral immunity may enhance production of anti-TSH receptor antibodies. In contrast to GD, however, the prevailing antibodies are inhibitory of

the TSH receptor (Rees Smith *et al.*, 1988; Rapoport *et al.*, 1998). A study by Kawakami *et al.* (1997) using IgG from patients with idiopathic myxoedema showed that thyroid cells may undergo apoptosis, due to lack of TSH trophic effect, leading to thyroid atrophy and hypothyroidism. The pathogenic role of blocking anti-TSH receptor antibodies in causing hypothyroidism in autoimmune thyroiditis is also suggested by their capacity to induce neonatal transient hypothyroidism (Brown *et al.*, 1996).

Finally, the other forms of chronic autoimmune thyroiditis, silent (postpartum or sporadic) thyroiditis resemble that of HT but the degree of lymphocytic infiltration is milder (Pearce *et al.*, 2003). It appears that an initial phase with destruction of thyroid cells due to apoptosis and/or necrosis takes place leading to mild thyrotoxicosis, but this destructive phase is transient and not persistent as in HT. The destructive phase is usually followed by a recovery phase during which temporary hypothyroidism may occur. However, thyroid function eventually returns to normal in the majority of patients although a small number may go on to develop HT.

### Conclusions

It is generally accepted that AITD is a complex and polygenic organ-specific autoimmune disorder. Interaction of environmental, genetic and endogenous factors may play a role in the initiation, progression and clinical outcome of the disease. From the above analysis of current data, a unifying hypothesis for the pathogenesis of AITD may be formulated (Fig. 4).

Environmental factors, including iodine excess, may set the scene by causing thyroid cell damage and release of potential autoantigens. Professional APCs are called upon, take up and present the relevant autoantigens to immune cells in the draining the thyroid lymph nodes. Aberrant regulation of immune response determined by genetic or endogenous factors lead to inappropriate and excessive immune reaction instead of reinforcing immune tolerance towards self-antigens. Consequently, autoreactive T and B lymphocytes accumulate in large numbers, infiltrating the thyroid parenchyma. Thus the thyroid gland is converted into a battlefield with the invading lymphocytes on one

side and the defending thyroid cells on the other, fighting for survival. The outcome of this battle determines the phenotypic expression of the disease which is largely dependent on the balance between Th1 and Th2 response and the different profile of inflammatory cytokines released in the local microenvironment. A predominantly Th1 type of response favouring cellular immunity may facilitate a proapoptotic milieu for thyroid cells. Fas and/or TRAIL-dependent pathways are activated by Th1 type inflammatory cytokines and thyroid cells undergo apoptosis leading to HT or its variants (silent thyroiditis). A predominantly Th2

phenotype which favours humoral immunity may induce B lymphocytes to produce anti-TSH receptor antibodies and create an antiapoptotic potential for the thyroid cells and pro-apoptotic milieu for the intrathyroidal lymphocytes. If the prevailing type of anti-TSH antibodies is stimulatory for the TSH receptor, thyroid cell hyperplasia and hyperfunction ensue, leading to Graves' hyperthyroidism. Thus, the potential to produce TSH receptor-stimulating antibodies may be an important branch point towards the development of GD instead of HT. If, on the other hand, TSH receptor inhibitory antibodies predominate, then thyroid cell atrophy and hypofunction develop, leading to atrophic thyroiditis.

A better understanding of how an aberrant immune response against the thyroid gland is initiated and propagated through divergent pathways, leading to different phenotypic expression of AITD, is required. Knowledge of these mechanisms may allow the development of new aetiologically based therapeutic modalities for these common autoimmune disorders.
