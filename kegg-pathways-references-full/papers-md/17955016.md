# Genetics of adrenal tumors associated with Cushing’s syndrome: a new classification for bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasias

Constantine A Stratakis* and Sosipatros A Boikos

## SUMMARY

Adrenocortical causes of Cushing’s syndrome include the following: common cortisol-producing adenomas, which are usually isolated (without associated tumors) and sporadic (without a family history); rare, but often clinically devastating, adrenocortical carcinomas; and a spectrum of adrenocorticotropic-independent, and almost always bilateral, hyperplasias, which are not rare, and are the most recently recognized cause. The majority of benign lesions of the adrenal cortex seem to be linked to abnormalities of the cyclic AMP signaling pathway, whereas cancer is linked to aberrant expression of insulin-like growth factor II, tumor protein p53 and related molecules. In this article, we propose a new clinical classification and nomenclature for the various forms of adrenocorticotropic-independent adrenocortical hyperplasias that is based on their histologic and genetic features. We also review the molecular genetics of adrenocortical tumors, including recent discoveries relating to the role of phosphodiesterase 11A. This is a timely Review because of recent advances in the clinical and molecular understanding of these diseases.

KEYWORDS adrenal tumors, Cushing’s syndrome, phosphodiesterases, protein kinase A, tumor-suppressor genes

## INTRODUCTION

Adrenocortical tumors (ACTs) have been known to cause Cushing’s syndrome for almost 100 years. Until recently, however, most textbooks of endocrinology, medicine or surgery, as well as authoritative reviews on the subject, would venture little beyond the common adrenocortical adenoma (ADA) and the rare adrenocortical carcinoma (ACA). At most, the literature would mention primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) and adrenocorticotropic-independent macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (AIMAH)—also known as ‘massive macronodular adrenocortical disease’ (MMAD)—as two rare forms of bilateral tumor that cause Cushing’s syndrome.¹ These two disorders were only briefly mentioned in the most recent discussion of the clinical management of incidentally discovered adrenal masses (incidentalomas), published in 2003.²

NOMENCLATURE AND HISTOLOGY OF ADRENOCORTICAL LESIONS

The various types of adrenocortical lesions, their histology and other information are provided in Table 1. The common cortisol-producing ADA of the zona fasciculata needs little introduction, although histologic variants of this common lesion exist.⁴

Table 1 lists no less than six types of bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasia (BAH). These are all adrenocorticotropic-independent forms of BAH and, thus, by definition, disorders that bear no similarity to the various forms of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) that are all

Figure 1 Macroscopic features of various adrenocortical lesions. The upper panels (A and B) are representative cases of micronodular bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasias. (A) Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease due to a germline mutation in PRKAR1A (protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, regulatory, type I, α gene). (B) Isolated micronodular adrenocortical disease in a patient with no other tumors and no PRKAR1A mutations. The lower panels (C and D) are representative cases of adrenocorticotropic-independent macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia (AIMAH). (C) AIMAH with hyperplastic internodular cortex; the adrenal gland is symmetrically enlarged and distinct nodules were only seen when tissue was examined microscopically. (D) AIMAH with internodular atrophy. In (D), multiple nodules of various sizes are seen: they have distinct boundaries that are easily seen macroscopically, and the internodular cortex is atrophic.

There are two additional basic characteristics that are used in this classification of BAHs (Figures 1 and 2): the status—hyperplasia or atrophy—of the surrounding cortex; and the presence of pigment within the lesion or surrounding cortex. Hyperplasia or atrophy of the ‘normal’ cortex—the internodular cortex around the lesions in bilateral diseases—can assist in subgrouping both macronodular and micronodular forms of BAH.⁴ At present, there is no good explanation of this variability in the status of the internodular cortex in the various forms of BAH; it is conceivable that this feature depends on the presence of paracrine or genetic factors that act locally.

The pigment in the adrenocortical lesions is most often lipofuscin; demonstration of neuromelanin pigmentation requires pretreatment of tissue with potassium permanganate, followed by staining with hematoxylin and eosin.⁴ Lipofuscin is thought to be derived from secondary lysosomes and to represent lysosomal residual bodies containing end products of oxidative damage to lipids.⁵ It accumulates with age⁵ and, in the adrenal gland, appears macroscopically as light brown to, sometimes, dark brown or even black discoloration of the tumorous or hyperplastic lesion.⁴ Microscopically, lipofuscin can be seen as dark granular pigment, but electron microscopy provides the ultimate proof of its existence, if this is in question.⁶

ACA and its histology, clinical presentation and other features have recently been reviewed elsewhere.⁴,⁷,⁸ Cases of adenomas or BAH that became autonomously functioning (adrenocorticotropic-independent) after long-standing Cushing’s disease (adrenocorticotropic-dependent Cushing’s syndrome) are not discussed here. In at least some of these cases, pre-existing conditions have been found, for example a patient reported to have multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1), Cushing’s disease and BAH (CA Stratakis et al., unpublished data).

MOLECULAR PATHWAYS IN ADRENOCORTICAL EMBRYOLOGY AND TUMORS

The WNT signaling pathway

The development of the adrenal cortex is tightly linked to that of the gonads and other structures derived from the urogenital ridge. In human tumor genetics, knowledge of adrenocortical embryology is necessary to understand the genes and processes that are involved in the genesis of ACTs.

Figure 3 demonstrates several of the important molecular pathways that have been linked to formation of ACTs. Molecules that are important for normal adrenocortical formation include Wilms’ tumor 1 (encoded by WT1; mutations of WT1 are associated with Wilms’ tumor), a transcriptional regulator that is mutated in Denys–Drash and Frasier syndromes,^9^ and WNT4 (wingless-type MMTV integration site family member 4) and WNT11, both involved in signaling through the Frizzled receptor family. Mice that have knockouts of Wt1 and Wnt4 have hypoplastic adrenal glands.^10,11^ The WNT signaling pathway is considered to be essential for adrenocortical development and function.^12^ Today, most studies of gene expression in ACTs identify WNT signaling as, perhaps, the most important pathway involved (through its various members) in both benign and malignant ACT formation;^13-20^ furthermore, β-catenin mutations have been identified in sporadic (without a family history) adrenal adenomas and cancer (Figure 3 and Table 1).^18,21^

### Inhibin A

Inhibin A (INHA) participates in the normal transition and development of the adult adrenal cortex, at least in rodents.^22^ Homozygous *Inha* knockout mice develop gonadal tumors at 4–5 weeks of age and die at 12 weeks.^23^ Gonadectomy before formation of gonadal tumors postponed the wasting syndrome and enabled development of ACTs at a later age (21 weeks); death followed at 33–36 weeks.^23,24^ In another transgenic mouse model that expressed a 6 kb fragment of the *Inha* promoter fused with the simian virus 40 T-antigen (SV40-Tag), gonadal tumors were found in all animals at an age of 5–8 months.^25^ In these animals, gonadectomy at an age of 4 weeks was followed by development of ACTs at the same age that gonadal tumors would have appeared.^25^ INHA gene expression is altered in human pediatric ACTs^18^ and other tumors,^26^ and we have reported rare inhibitory mutations of the gene and loss of its locus in a similar population of patients who mostly had ADAs.^27^

### The role of transcription factors

The development of the adrenogonadal primordium from the urogenital ridge is dependent on nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1 (NR5A1; also known as ‘SF1’) and NR0B1 (also known as ‘DAX1’). *Nr5a1* knockout

Figure 3 Molecular pathways involved in adrenocortical hyperplasias and other adrenal tumors. (A) Ligand binding to the GPCR activates Gsα, which activates AC to generate cAMP. PKA catalytic subunits are released following cAMP binding to the PKA regulatory subunits. The active catalytic subunits phosphorylate targets in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus. Defects in this molecular pathway can lead to all forms of bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasias discussed in the text. Melanocortin 2 receptor, which is a GPCR that binds adrenocorticotropic hormone, has been implicated in adrenocortical tumorigenesis, albeit infrequently. (B) Inactivating germline mutations in the gene encoding PDE11A were first described in isolated micronodular adrenocortical disease but are probably related to all forms of bilateral adrenocortical hyperplasias and even sporadic adrenocortical adenomas. (C) Receptors for IGFII are present in adrenal tissues; IGFII overexpression is essential for the growth of monoclonal lesions, such as large adenomas and adrenal cancer. (D) Human adrenocortical cells produce dimeric activins and inhibins. It is not known whether inhibins display their effects by antagonizing activins or binding to specific signaling receptors. Inhibin, TGF-β or activin signaling through their type I and type II receptors (which are serine and threonine kinases) is an important pathway in the regulation of adrenocortical cell proliferation; activin binding to the type II receptor leads to activation of the type I receptor. Phosphorylation of both receptors leads to the recruitment of SARA, which promotes phosphorylation of SMAD2 and SMAD3. Phosphorylated SMAD2 and SMAD3 (in addition to SMAD4) are translocated to the nucleus, where they activate transcription of specific genes; menin binds to SMAD3. (E) Mitochondrial function seems to have a role in adrenal tumorigenesis; fumarate hydratase mutations are associated with the formation of adrenal tumors. (F) WNT signaling activates the Frizzled family receptors, which leads to phosphorylation of a member of the Dishevelled family of proteins, inactivation of GSK3β and stabilization of β-catenin and subsequent target-gene expression through TCF, LEF family transcription factors and, probably, SF1 (also known as NR5A1 [nuclear receptor subfamily 5 group A member 1]) in adrenal tissues. Germline APC-inactivating and somatic β-catenin-activating mutations are associated with adrenocortical tumors. (G) Cell-cycle arrest and cell death are controlled by p53 and p21; TP53 (tumor protein p53) mutations are frequent in sporadic adrenocortical cancer.

The cyclic AMP signaling pathway and ectopic receptor expression

For adrenocortical growth and differentiation, normal function of both adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and its receptor (termed the 'melanocortin 2 receptor' [MC2R]) is essential; elevated adrenocorticotropic levels lead to adrenocortical hyperplasia. Physiological regulation of the cyclic AMP (cAMP) signaling pathway that mediates adrenocorticotropic action is necessary, therefore, for normal adrenocortical anatomy and function.

Homozygote or compound heterozygote inactivating mutations of either the pro-opiomelanocortin gene (POMC)—which encodes the adrenocorticotropic precursor—or MC2R lead to adrenocortical insufficiency (albeit at a later age than that reported in association with NR5A1 or NR0B1 mutations). An activating mutation of the MC2R gene has been linked with macronodular hyperplasia in one patient with no apparent transmission of the disease, although the details of the case are unavailable. Similarly, patients with MAS can develop bilateral adrenocortical macronodules that contain an activating mutation in GNAS, which encodes the stimulatory G-protein α subunit. A few patients with AIMAH have also been described with somatic GNAS mutations in their adrenocortical nodules. Activation of the cAMP signaling pathway seems to be the cause of hyperplasia in most cases of AIMAH, in PPANAD due to mutations in PRKAR1A (protein kinase, cAMP-dependent, regulatory, type I, α gene) and in several sporadic ACTs associated with Cushing's syndrome.

There is, perhaps, no better example of the wide involvement of the cAMP signaling pathway in ACT development than that of the ectopic expression of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) in AIMAH and sporadic ADAs. Although in several situations the expression of ectopic GPCRs might be considered secondary or even tertiary to a primary, yet elusive, genetic defect, examples of both familial ectopic expression of GPCRs in AIMAH and animal models with transgenic expression of a GPCR, leading to development of a tumor or hyperplasia, have been reported.

Steroidogenic enzymes in the adrenal cortex and tumors

Deficiency of any of the enzymes that participate in steroid biosynthesis affects the early development of the adrenal cortex, interfering with both differentiation and zonation. Hyperplasia and abnormal zonation are evident in CAH-affected fetuses, as well as in their adult cortex that forms later; patients with CAH who develop cancer have also been reported. Adrenocorticotropic hormone regulates steroid biosynthesis, by stimulating cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA)-mediated phosphorylation of a cholesterol ester hydrolase (which, in turn, mobilizes cholesterol), and activates steroidogenic enzymes. Longer stimulation with adrenocorticotropic hormone results in augmented synthesis of steroidogenic enzymes, adrenodoxin and adrenodoxin reductase. In CAH, continuous stimulation of the adrenal cortex thus leads to hyperplasia and hypertrophy; progression of hyperplasia to monoclonal proliferation and subsequently to large adenomas, or even cancer, has long been postulated to be one of the processes leading to ACT formation.

Growth factors and the TP53 tumor-suppressor gene

The insulin-like growth factors type I and II (IGF-I and IGF-II) and their binding proteins (IGFBPs), IGFBP2 in particular, have been linked to abnormal adrenocortical cell growth and proliferation in both cancer and hyperplasia, especially PPANAD. There is no evidence for a clinically important role of the IGF system in essential adrenocortical functions: patients with growth hormone receptor defects (Laron’s syndrome) do not have adrenocortical insufficiency, and mice with IGF-I or IGF-II defects do not seem to have corticosterone deficiency. By contrast, a human genetic paradigm of IGF-II excess leading to ACTs is the association of Beckwith–Wiedemann syndrome with adrenal cancer.

Other tumor-suppressor genes and even mutations in enzymes of the mitochondrial oxidation pathway are also involved in the formation of cortisol-producing ACTs: patients with familial polyposis coli and germline mutations in APC (adenomatosis polyposis coli gene) develop both nonfunctioning and functioning adenomas and/or BAH. Similarly, patients with MEN1 and germline mutations in MEN1 (which encodes menin) often have BAH and, rarely, develop adrenocorticotropic-independent Cushing’s syndrome. The role of APC and MEN1 in normal adrenocortical physiology remains unknown. Patients with hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cancer who have germline mutations in the gene encoding fumarate hydratase can also have ACTs and/or AIMAH.

The physiological role of the p53 protein in adrenocortical cell development, differentiation and function is largely unknown. By contrast, patients with inactivating TP53 mutations develop ACTs: in Li–Fraumeni syndrome, germline TP53 mutations lead to the development of ACAs (albeit rarely, compared with the frequency of development of several other forms of tumor in patients with the syndrome).<sup>54</sup> A pH-dependent inactivation of the p53 protein leads to development of both ADAs and ACAs in association with the frequent (at least in Brazilian patients with ACTs) Arg337His mutation of the TP53.<sup>55,56</sup> Mutations of the cell-cycle-linked and TP53-associated gene CHEK2 (checkpoint 2; previously known as CHK2) are similarly linked to Li–Fraumeni syndrome and presumably ACA,<sup>57</sup> although there have been no studies of this gene in sporadic ACTs.

(PDE11A) could be found in a subgroup of patients with PPNAD and other forms of BAH.<sup>62</sup> PDE11A is a dual-specificity PDE catalyzing the hydrolysis of both cAMP and cyclic GMP; it is expressed in several endocrine tissues, including the adrenal cortex.<sup>63–65</sup> PDE11A was mapped to the 2q31–35 chromosomal region, and tumors from patients with PDE11A-inactivating mutations demonstrated 2q allelic losses.<sup>62</sup> The PDE11A locus, like that of other PDEs, has a complex genomic organization; of the four possible splice variants, only PDE11A4 seems to be expressed in the adrenal cortex, whereas PDE11A1 is ubiquitous, and PDE11A2 and PDE11A3 have a more limited pattern of expression. Other recent data show that PDE11A is expressed in adrenocortical tissue<sup>62–66</sup> and its expression seems to be modified in a variety of tumors beyond PPNAD and other forms of BAH.

### MOLECULAR GENETICS OF ADRENOCORTICAL HYPERPLASIAS

As mentioned above, aberrant cAMP signaling has been linked to genetic forms of cortisol excess that lead to Cushing’s syndrome, mostly in BAHs: macronodular adrenocortical hyperplasia can be due to GNAS mutations associated with either MAS or sporadic adrenal tumors.<sup>34,35</sup> Micronodular BAH and its more well-known variant, PPNAD, can be caused by germline-inactivating mutations of the PRKAR1A gene.<sup>37,38</sup> Most patients with PPNAD also have Carney complex, an autosomal dominant multiple neoplasia syndrome associated with skin lesions, cardiac myxomas and other nonendocrine and endocrine tumors; in most patients with Carney complex, the disease is caused by PRKAR1A mutations.<sup>58–61</sup>

During the past few years, it has become apparent that there are several forms of micronodular BAH that are not caused by germline-inactivating mutations of the PRKAR1A gene (Table 1). We described one such case associated with an atypical episodic form of Cushing’s syndrome in a young child.<sup>6</sup> Her adrenal histology showed moderate, diffuse cortical hyperplasia and massive circumscribed and infiltrating extra-adrenal cortical excrescences that, in many cases, formed micronodules that were nonpigmented. Synaptophysin, a marker for PPNAD, also stained the nodules, in addition to the surrounding cortex.

Recently, we reported that inactivating mutations of the phosphodiesterase (PDE) 11A gene

#### FREQUENCY OF PDE11A SEQUENCE VARIANTS IN THE POPULATION

Horvath *et al.*<sup>66</sup> searched for the five PDE11A sequence variants associated with BAH or adrenal tumors (Arg804His, Arg867Gly, c.171Tdel/fs41X, c.919C>T/p.R307X and c.1655_1657TCTdel/CCins) in DNA samples from 745 individuals included in the prospective cancer prevalence study of the New York area population (the New York Cancer Project): all PDE11A sequence variants were identified in this set of more than 2,000 alleles, including the c.1655_1657TCTdel/CCins complex defect that was previously identified *de novo* in a nonfamilial case of BAH. All PDE11A sequence variants were more frequent among patients with adrenocortical tumors; the lower CI of the odds ratio was above 1.0 for all sequence variants except the c.171Tdel/fs41X and c.1655_1657TCTdel/CCins mutations.<sup>66</sup>

#### ADRENAL HYPERPLASIAS: GENOTYPE-PHENOTYPE CORRELATIONS

The PDE11A data support the hypothesis that this gene is not necessarily causative of BAH but that it is associated with a low-penetrance predisposition to the development of BAH and possibly other ACTs, leading to Cushing’s syndrome and, perhaps, other conditions. In addition, two missense sequence changes (Arg804His and Arg867Gly) in PDE11A seem to be frequent in the general population. The odds ratio for the presence of Arg804His among patients with BAH or incidentally discovered adrenal tumors is 4.25 (95% CI, 0.95–19.13) and
its pathogenicity is supported by in vitro data;⁵⁵ the in vitro effects of Arg867Gly are less clear.⁶⁶

The previously identified PDE11A protein-truncating mutations were also found in the New York Cancer Project population. Currently, we do not have access to the patients who were found to be carriers of these genetic defects, which makes this finding of uncertain significance at present. Similarly, the fact that several patients had a family history of various types of cancer is interesting and suggests the intriguing possibility that a carrier state for these defects might be a predisposing factor to a variety of tumors. Indeed, significant expression of PDE11A in a number of endocrine tissues, and in the prostate in particular, was noted in several recent studies.⁶²⁻⁶⁴

Although the cause of all forms of BAH studied to date seems to be linked to increased cAMP signaling, the histopathological changes in the adrenal glands of patients with the various mutations or functional abnormalities of this pathway differ significantly. PRKAR1A mutations are associated with the pigmented micronodular variant of BAH that is known as PPANAD, whereas PDE11A mutations seem to predispose to a variety of lesions from isolated (without any other associated tumors) PPANAD to nonpigmented micronodular hyperplasia. GNAS mutations are associated with the macronodular and clearly nonpigmented form of BAH. Sporadic ACTs can be associated with somatic mutations in all three of these genes (Fragoso *et al.*,³⁵ Bertherat *et al.*,³⁸ Horvath *et al.*;⁶⁶ CA Stratakis *et al.*, unpublished data).

In all forms of BAH associated with increased cAMP signaling, there are patients with mutations in one of the three causative genes who do not present with overt Cushing’s syndrome. The frequency of ‘classic’ Cushing’s syndrome seems to be higher in PRKAR1A mutation carriers than in PDE11A-associated or GNAS-associated disease. There is, however, significant interindividual variability and no apparent genotype–phenotype correlation. The age at which Cushing’s syndrome presents in these disorders is almost exactly the reverse, with patients who have MAS (carriers of GNAS mutations) almost always presenting in infancy, whereas at least some of the patients with PDE11A mutations seem to present mostly in early childhood and carriers of PRKAR1A mutations present in late adolescence and young adulthood. In addition, almost all patients with PDE11A genetic defects and

Cushing’s syndrome are female,⁶²,⁶⁶ and the majority of patients with PRKAR1A defects and Cushing’s syndrome are also female (Stratakis *et al.*;⁵⁹ CA Stratakis *et al.*, unpublished data). A number of factors are thus likely to affect the expression of these mutations—developmental, hormonal and, perhaps, gender-related factors. Finally, the presence of allelic losses of the corresponding normal allele in adrenal tissues seems also to be a determining factor in the development of disease associated with PRKAR1A and PDE11A mutations, because both genes were identified using studies of the loss of heterozygosity.⁵⁸,⁶²,⁶⁶

PDE11A is the first PDE to be linked to an inherited condition associated with tumor formation, but it might not be the only enzyme of this large family of proteins that predisposes to tumors. Our genome-wide dataset⁶² suggests that other PDEs are likely to be involved in adrenal tumorigenesis in a similar manner: not by causing tumors *per se*, but by being a predisposing factor. Little is known about PDE11A or other PDEs in adrenocortical tissue; however, such tissue seems to exhibit significant PDE activity in an in vitro model.⁶⁷ Our preliminary data suggest that several PDEs are expressed in the cortex; PDE11A is expressed at levels that are higher than those of most other such enzymes, with the exception of PDE8B.⁶²

The high frequency of PDE11A-inactivating mutations in the population,⁶⁶ the possibility that other members of this large family of proteins are involved in ACT formation,⁶²,⁶⁷ and the identification of clinically silent carriers⁶²,⁶⁶ raise an interesting question: is it possible that PDE11A mutations (or mutations in a similar gene) underlie the high frequency of incidental-omas⁶⁸ in the general population? At the moment, this question cannot be answered and the idea remains speculative; larger and prospective studies must be performed to elucidate this interesting potential connection.

### CONCLUSIONS

This is an exciting time in the study of ACTs associated with Cushing’s syndrome: not only have a number of new disorders been described, but it is now also known that most of the benign adrenocortical lesions associated with Cushing’s syndrome are linked in one way or another to dysregulation of cAMP signaling. It is also known that cancer forms in the context of p53 mutations and/or IGFII upregulation. This new knowledge
has yet to lead to new therapies, however: it is our hope that pharmacological therapy of Cushing’s syndrome by molecular targeting will, in the future, replace adrenalectomy for benign lesions and lead to better outcomes in cancer. Finally, large genome-wide association and prospective studies will clarify the role of certain genetic variants in the formation of incidentalomas in the general population.

### KEY POINTS

- Hyperplasias cause Cushing’s syndrome more frequently than was previously thought, and they include an expanding list of diverse diseases
- The WNT (wingless-type MMTV integration site family) pathway is an important molecular pathway involved in both adrenocortical development and tumor formation
- Inhibin A and tumor protein p53 (the products of the INHA and TP53 genes, respectively) are involved in the formation of malignant adrenocortical tumors
- An overactive cyclic AMP signaling pathway is involved in most adrenocortical hyperplasias and occasionally in sporadic adenomas
- Insulin-like growth factor II mediates the most important signaling pathway in adrenal cancer
- Genetic defects of phosphodiesterases might be a frequent cause of adrenal and, possibly, other tumors
