**Abstract** Diabetic retinopathy is a major diabetic complication with a highly complex etiology. Although there are many pathways involved, it has become established that chronic exposure of the retina to hyperglycemia gives rise to accumulation of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) that play an important role in retinopathy. In addition, the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) is ubiquitously expressed in various retinal cells and is upregulated in the retinas of diabetic patients, resulting in activation of pro-oxidant and proinflammatory signaling pathways. This AGE-RAGE axis appears to play a central role in the sustained inflammation, neurodegeneration, and retinal microvascular dysfunction occurring during diabetic retinopathy. The nature of AGE formation and RAGE signaling bring forward possibilities for therapeutic intervention. The multiple components of the AGE-RAGE axis, including signal transduction, formation of ligands, and the end-point effectors, may be promising targets for strategies to treat diabetic retinopathy.

## Introduction

Advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), the nonenzymatic glycation adducts and hallmarks of sustained hyperglycemia during diabetes, are able to trigger inflammation including immune responses, oxidative stress, and neovascularization in various diabetic complications, including diabetic retinopathy due to the abundance of long-life matrix proteins. This is accomplished through several mechanisms, among which receptor for AGEs (RAGE) plays a central role to mediate AGE-induced proinflammatory signaling in many retinal cells [1]. Rapidly expanding knowledge about the mechanisms of signal transduction in AGE/RAGE-related pathogenesis in addition to the recent development of AGE- or RAGE-specific inhibitors has led to trials of AGEs and/or RAGE inhibition as treatment for diabetic retinopathy, which has shown some clear advantages over previously established interventions. Therefore, this review will focus on the recent proceedings of the investigation on AGE/RAGE-mediated proinflammatory signaling, and the application of AGE/RAGE-targeted therapies for diabetic retinopathy.

### Diabetic Retinopathy

Diabetes is a chronic disease that causes progressive damage to many organs and tissues. These so-called “complications” classically impact the heart, eyes, kidneys, and nerves, but it is now appreciated that virtually all organs are adversely affected by the diabetic milieu. Diabetic retinopathy is the most common diabetic complication and a leading cause of vision loss. Among US adults with diabetes, the estimated prevalence of diabetic retinopathy is 28.5% and progression to vision-threatening endpoints occurs in 4.4% [2]. According to the data from the World Health Organization, among the over 220 million people with diabetes worldwide, after 15 years of diabetes duration, approximately 2% of people become blind, and about 10% develop severe visual impairment underscoring the importance of this diabetic complication.

Diabetic retinopathy is characterized by microvascular lesions such as impaired blood flow regulation, increased vasopermeability, capillary basement membrane thickening, microaneurysm formation, capillary dropout, and eventually widespread nonperfusion and ischemia. Occurring in union with microvascular lesions, neural and glial abnormalities are also apparent in the retina and although these changes have not been widely used in clinical classification. They are now recognized to be an important component of the condition. The relationship between hyperglycemia and retinopathy has been revealed by the DCCT (Diabetes Control and Complications Trial) and UKPDS (United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study) in type 1 and type 2 diabetes mellitus, respectively [3]. In addition, other risk factors including hypertension and dyslipidemia play important roles in the pathogenesis.

### Advanced Glycation End Products

In 1912, a French food chemist called Louis Camille Maillard described that “brown products” were formed upon heating mixtures of amino acids and sugars. By this so-called “Maillard reaction,” post-translational protein modifications occur through nonenzymatic reactions between reducing sugars and free amino groups of proteins, forming AGEs.

#### Food-Derived AGEs

AGEs can also be generated by heating food containing high levels of fat, sugar, and proteins. AGE enrichment in food varies upon several factors including nutrient composition, temperature, humidity, pH, and duration of cooking. For example, among the 250 foods tested by Goldberg et al. [5], foods of the fat group had the highest amount of AGEs with a mean of 100±19 kU/g, whereas the meat and meat-substitute group also showed a high mean of 43±7 kU/g. Studies on both human and animal subjects show the direct association of dietary AGEs and circulating or tissue AGE levels [6]. In vitro studies indicate that food-derived AGEs also induce protein cross-linking and intracellular oxidant stress similar to the AGEs that are formed endogenously [7].

#### The Biochemical Nature of AGEs

The enhanced nonenzymatic glycation of proteins is a major consequence of sustained hyperglycemia. In the early stages of the Maillard reaction, Schiff’s bases are formed between reactive sugars and ε-amino groups, and then slowly rearrange intramolecularly to form relatively stable Amadori products. A well-known example of a physiologically relevant Amadori product is glycated hemoglobin A₁c, which has been used as a useful clinical indicator of glycemic control and used in two main landmark trials, the DCCT and the UKPDS [3]. Amadori products may further undergo rearrangement to form highly stable AGEs, the major forms of which in vivo include Nε-(carboxymethyl) lysine (CML), hydroimidazole, crossline, pentosidine, furoyl-furanyl imidazole (FFI), 1-alkyl-2-foryl-3,4-glycosyl-pyrrole, argpyrimidine, glyoxal lysine dimer (GOLD), and methylglyoxal lysine dimer (MOLD). The rate of AGE formation and accumulation depends on many factors such as the nature of the reducing sugar, availability of metal ions, redox balances, and longevity of the modified protein. AGE formation may lead to protein cross-linking, which may result in abnormal tertiary structure and alter enzymatic activity, receptor recognition, and normal protein turnover/clearance [1].

#### The Influence of AGEs on Biological Systems

As a consequence of chronic hyperglycemia, endogenous AGEs are capable of inducing a wide range of abnormal responses in vivo, such as aberrant expression and secretion of growth factors and proinflammatory cytokines, enhancement of pro-oxidant states, alteration of extracellular matrix, and cell apoptosis. It has been shown in animal models that dietary AGEs have important roles in the induction of type 1 diabetes mellitus in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice, insulin resistance in diabetes (db/db) mice, atherosclerosis in apolipoprotein E-deficient mice, diabetic nephropathy, and wound healing in NOD and db/db mice [8].

In the context of diabetic retinopathy, AGEs may affect retinal cells by receptor-dependent and/or receptor-independent pathways. Serum AGEs may bind to cells such as endothelium, pericytes, glia, and microglia through their receptors, the best characterized of which is RAGE, to induce intracellular signaling in a receptor-dependent manner. Intra-

cellular AGEs cause cell damage in a receptor-independent manner by activating mitochondrial superoxide and signaling intermediates such as protein kinase C [1]. Matrix AGEs are often formed on extracellular matrix proteins, especially surrounding the capillary basement membrane due to their slow turnover rate [9]. Matrix AGEs can influence cell function by both interacting with receptors and reducing basement membrane deformability, degradation, and matrix-cell interaction to induce oxidative stress and apoptosis [1].

### RAGE

AGES may bind to cell surface receptors to initiate cell signaling. The AGE receptors identified so far include AGE-R1, -R2, -R3, scavenger receptors ScR-II and CD-36, and RAGE [10]. RAGE is the best characterized receptor for AGEs and was originally isolated as an immunoglobulin-like AGE-binding protein from lung extracts [11]. However, unlike most of the immunoglobulin-like transmembrane receptors, this so-called pattern recognition receptor is capable of binding to multiple ligands, including S100 proteins/calgranulins, amphoterin/high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), amyloid-β (Aβ), and Mac-1 (alpha(M) beta(2), CD11b/CD18) [12•].

### RAGE Functional Domains

RAGE is composed of 404 amino acids with the calculated molecular mass of 35 kDa and an actual molecular mass of 45 to 55 kDa (depending on the precise nature of post-translational modifications such as glycosylation) [11]. Full-length RAGE is composed of an N-terminal signal peptide (aa 1–22), a V-type (aa 23–116) and two C-type immunoglobulin-like domains (aa 124–221 and aa 227–317), a transmembrane region (aa 340–361), and a short C-terminal intracellular tail (aa 362–404) [11]. The V domain is the region that mediates ligand-receptor binding. Among the endogenous AGE adducts, CML is the best characterized. This adduct is thought to be a specific and signal-inducing AGE ligand for RAGE, although the accumulation of CML is not always associated with RAGE and some data have demonstrated that CML-modified β-lactoglobulin or human serum albumin can neither bind to RAGE nor activate proinflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells [13].

Other extracellular domains of RAGE are also involved in ligand binding. For example, S100B binds to both the V and C1 domains whereas S100A6 binds to C1 and C2 domains, and these regions have been proposed as an integrated structural unit for ligand recognition [14]. It is established that the cytoplasmic tail is indispensable for RAGE signaling, as demonstrated by the fact that dominant-negative RAGE (lacking the cytosolic tail) can inhibit RAGE-mediated signaling, even in the presence of full-length RAGE [15].

### RAGE Isoforms and Srage

The human RAGE gene (also known as AGER) is located in the major histocompatibility complex class III region on 6p21.3. It contains 11 exons interlaced by 10 introns. To date, 19 naturally occurring RAGE splicing variants giving rise to either N-terminally or C-terminally truncated proteins have been identified, including hRAGEsec, sRAGE1, sRAGE2, sRAGE3, N-truncated and Secretory, Δ8-RAGE, RageΔ, NtRAGEΔ and sRAGEΔ, RAGE_v4 and RAGE_v13 [16]. Soluble RAGE (sRAGE) may be generated by proteolytic cleavage of full-length RAGE as well, as demonstrated by this isoform occurring in full-length RAGE-transfected HEK293 cells and PMA or HMGB1-treated HeLa cells, possibly via ADAM10 (dis-integrin and metalloproteinase) protease cleavage [12•]. The function of these truncated RAGE isoforms has yet to be completely elucidated, although it is known that soluble isoforms such as sRAGE and esRAGE (endogenous secretory RAGE) (which lack the intracellular region) may act as decoys for full-length receptor by competitive ligand binding.

Dysregulation of RAGE isoforms may have important impact on many important diseases. Abnormal expression of sRAGE or esRAGE has been shown in Alzheimer’s disease, atherosclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, vascular diseases, type 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus, and diabetic complications [12•].

### RAGE Signaling

Recent data using in-cell fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) has demonstrated that sRAGE forms tetramers that bind to hexamers of Ca²⁺-calgranulin C (S100A12) [17]. By nondenaturing gels and surface plasmon resonance, it has been shown that RAGE may be present at the plasma membrane as homodimers and heterodimers via its V domain as well as monomers [18]. In fact, RAGE ligands frequently function as oligomers/multimers. For example, besides S100A12, S100B protein is also known to be a noncovalently associated dimer at physiologically relevant concentrations (nanomolar) under reducing conditions. Aβ dimers can be isolated directly from Alzheimer’s brains [19].

Ligand binding enhances RAGE dimerization and triggers intracellular signaling [18], presumably via diaphanous-1 (mDia-1), which is a RAGE C-terminus-interacting protein [20]. mDia-1 is a member of the formin homology domain

protein family, and is required for RAGE ligand-stimulated cellular migration and activation of Rac-1 and Cdc42 in C6 glioma cells, and is also essential for hypoxia-stimulated RAGE-mediated regulation of early growth response-1 (Egr-1) in THP-1 macrophages, partially via protein kinase C βII, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) 1/2, and c-Jun NH2-terminal kinase [21].

So far, four major RAGE signaling pathways have been identified that mediate a range of cellular responses to different ligands: 1) Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT); 2) mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), including p44/42 (ERK1/2), p38, and c-Jun N-terminal kinases (JNK); 3) Ras-Rac-Cdc42; and 4) phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K)-Akt/PKB. Activation of these signaling pathways can evoke DNA-binding activity in a variety of nuclear transcription factors such as nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), STAT1/STAT3/STAT5, and activator protein 1 (AP-1). These pathways work either independently or synergistically under certain circumstances. For instance, Aβ activates p38 MAPK, but not SAPK/JNK, and stimulates intracellular uptake of the Aβ-RAGE complex [22]. Rac and Cdc42 but not Ras mediate HMGB1-RAGE-induced neurite outgrowth [23]. In contrast, S100B induces brain inflammatory disorders via RAGE-dependent activation of several inflammation-related signaling pathways, such as mDia-1/Rac1/JNK/AP-1, Ras/Rac1/NF-κB, and Src/Ras/PI3-K/RhoA/mDia-1 [24]. These findings suggest that RAGE-mediated cell responses are determined by a complex network of signaling pathways triggered by different ligands. In the future, different intracellular RAGE-interacting proteins in addition to mDia-1 may be further identified and this will add more to RAGE signaling complexity.

(CNS) tissue, consisting of many neurons, glia, retinal-pigmented epithelium (RPE), and hematopoietic-derived immune cells and blood vessels. AGEs and/or late Amadori products have been found to localize to many of these retinal cell types [1]. Many of the post-mitotic, differentiated cells of the eye have little or no regenerative capacity, which makes these cells particularly susceptible to systemic diseases that accelerate AGE modification of macromolecules [28].

RAGE is expressed in almost all of the retinal cells, although the highest expression levels seem to be in Müller cells [29, 30••]. RAGE expression in the retina has been predominantly localized to glia in the inner retina and is elevated in diabetic conditions [29]. RAGE is also induced by hyperglycemia in cultured human aortic endothelial cells and Müller glia in unison with its ligands [30••, 31•]. The activation of RAGE in retina by local or circulating ligands such as AGEs and S100B leads to changes in the activities of various retinal cells including Müller glia, retinal microglia, RPE, and retinal endothelial cells [1].

### RAGE and Müller Glia

Müller cells are the principal glial cells of the vertebrate retina and have a major role in maintaining the architecture and normal physiology of the retina. They are particularly susceptible to damage during diabetic retinopathy [32]. Retinal Müller glia can be activated by AGEs, leading to the induced production of VEGF, which may account for late-stage intraocular neovascularization in diabetic retinopathy [33]. Reactive changes in Müller glia such as the overexpression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) occur at the early stages and throughout the development of diabetic retinopathy [30••, 34]. AGE/ALE inhibition partially protects against diabetes-induced GFAP overexpression in Müller glia [35], indicating that AGE-mediated abnormalities may play an important role in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.

AGES may induce pathology in retinal Müller glia, at least in part, through binding to RAGE. In the nondiabetic retina, RAGE expression is constitutively expressed at low levels in Müller glia, whereas in diabetes there is significant upregulation of this receptor (where it colocalizes with GFAP and vimentin) [29, 30••]. It is noteworthy that in addition to AGEs, some of the other RAGE ligands are expressed in Müller glia and these may be capable of inducing proinflammatory signaling. For example, S100B, a member of a family of Ca²⁺-binding proteins of the EF-hand type is found in several retinal cell types including photoreceptors and Müller glia [36], where it may play a neurotrophic role at low levels. S100B upregulation was observed in the transretinal cytoplasmic processes of Müller glia in diabetic rat retina where it can induce inflammatory

### The AGE-RAGE Axis in Diabetic Retinopathy

Similar to reported findings in other diabetic complications, AGEs are elevated in the retina and in the serum of patients with diabetic retinopathy [1]. For example, through comparison of vitreous and serum levels of hydroimidazolone in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and nondiabetic controls it was demonstrated that increased vitreous hydroimidazolone is associated with severity of diabetic retinopathy [25]. An association between accumulation of CML and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in eyes with non-PDR and PDR has also been found [26].

Administration of AGE-modified albumin to rats resulted in retinal capillary basement membrane thickening, blood-retinal barrier dysfunction, and loss of pericytes [27]. However, the initiation and progression of diabetic retinopathy is not simply a function of AGE effects on the retinal vasculature. The retina is a complex central nervous system
cytokine expression [30••]. RAGE activation by ligand in Müller glia results in ERK1/2 activation and subsequently production of inflammatory cytokines such as VEGF and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), implicating the critical role of RAGE in neovascularization and recruitment of immune cells such as microglia into the deep retinal layers during diabetic retinopathy to induce inflammation [30••].

### Microglia

Microglia are the resident tissue macrophages of the CNS. These cells act as immunogenic sentinels and maintain homeostasis in a predominantly dendritic (resting) state. Microglial characterization has highlighted two types: M1 denoting an activated immunoreactive state, and M2 which is associated with inflammatory and proangiogenic properties [37]. During pathologic states, such as diabetes, Alzheimer’s disease, acute brain injury, and tumour outgrowth, aggregation of ligands such as S100B, Aβ, HMGB1, and AGEs may play a key role in microgliosis and activation, specifically of the M1 type. It is this aggregation, concurrent interaction with RAGE, and concomitant microglial response that may well drive the pathophysiologic effects highlighted during diabetic retinopathy, although considerably more research is required in this area.

### Retinal Endothelial Cells and the Microvasculature

Amadori-modified albumin is detectable in the capillaries of retinas of type 1 diabetic patients compared with healthy control subjects, implicating the early involvement of glycation reactions in diabetic retinopathy [38]. AGEs have been linked to loss of pericytes and blood-retinal barrier (BRB) breakdown [27], possibly through upregulation of intercellular adhesion molecule that mediates retinal capillary leukocyte adherence barrier dysfunction [39]. It is also well documented that oxidative stress is linked to AGE formation, and involved in retinal vascular dysfunction. AGEs, in turn, induce oxidative stress via activation of protein kinase C signaling pathways by RAGE, and, thus, to mediate retinal pericyte apoptosis, a histopathologic hallmark of diabetic retinopathy [40].

### Other Retinal Cells

The RPE are critical for maintaining retinal function via regulation of the visual cycle, forming the outer BRB and performing phagocytosis of spent tips of photoreceptor outer segments. It has been estimated that around 60% to 80% of retinal glucose is via the RPE’s high capacity transport system [41]. The RPE monolayer is exposed to Bruch’s membrane that is an extracellular matrix and a prime target for AGE modification due to its major component of collagen. AGEs increase VEGF mRNA and secreted protein from RPE in rat retina and in cultured human RPE [42]. Pigment epithelium–derived factor (PEDF), one of the anti-angiogenic factors secreted by RPE, shows an inverse association with proliferative retinopathy and its negative regulatory role in diabetic retinopathy can be downregulated by AGEs in endothelial cells, probably via oxidative stress generation [43]. In addition, PEDF inhibits AGE-induced retinal vascular permeability by targeting the PI3-K/Akt signaling pathway and suppressing NADPH oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and ZO-1 tight junction protein [44].

Activation of the AGE-RAGE axis can induce apoptosis of retinal neurons by activating nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which can be attenuated by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) [45]. The presence of RAGE and its upregulation on retinal ganglion cells make them susceptible to AGE-mediated proinflammatory signaling [46], which may also account for neurodegeneration during diabetic retinopathy, and warrants further investigation.

#### Targeting AGE-RAGE Axis for Diabetic Retinopathy

Regarding the central roles of AGE and RAGE in mediating proinflammatory signaling during diabetic retinopathy, several strategies can be used to target this axis and thereby prevent diabetic retinopathy (Fig. 1).

##### AGE Inhibitors

Many inhibitors have been developed to prevent advanced glycation or AGE cross-linking, such as aminoguanidine (or pimagedine), pyridoxamine (K-163, or Pyridorin [NephroGenex, Princeton, NJ]), OPB-9195, and LR-90, and they have shown variable levels of therapeutic efficacy in diabetic complications. Aminoguanidine, the first compound designed to inhibit AGE formation and cross-linking in vitro and in vivo, which is now known as an inducible NOS inhibitor as well, has shown efficacy for slowing the progression of overt nephropathy and retinopathy [47]. Pyridoxamine, a derivative of vitamin B₆, can prevent the accumulation of AGEs by trapping intermediates in the formation of Amadori products released from glycated proteins, and therefore prevent BRB dysfunction and inhibit development of retinopathy in experimental diabetes [48]. Combination of vitamins C and E and OPB-9195 markedly inhibits the increased apoptosis of retinal microvascular

Fig. 1 AGE/RAGE-mediated proinflammatory signaling and interventions. Chronic exposure of retinal matrix proteins gives rise to elevated AGE levels. Upon binding to RAGE, several intracellular signaling pathways are triggered, resulting in the upregulation of proinflammatory proteins including enzymes for ROS production and growth factors (eg, VEGF). Therapeutic interventions have been tested targeting different steps of the signaling cascade. AGE advanced glycation end products; AP-1 activator protein 1; DN-RAGE dominant-negative RAGE; ERK extracellular signal-regulated kinase; esRAGE endogenous secretory RAGE; iNOS inducible nitric oxide synthase; mDia-1 diaphanous-1; JAK Janus kinase; JNK c-Jun N-terminal kinase; NF-κB nuclear factor-κB; P phosphorylation; PI3-K phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RAGE receptor for AGEs; ROS reactive oxygen species; sRAGE soluble RAGE; STAT signal transducer and activator of transcription; VEGF vascular endothelial growth factor

cells in Goto-Kakizaki rats, a type 2 diabetic model [49]. LR-90 can reduce acellular capillary numbers and restore pericyte deficit in streptozotocin-induced diabetic Sprague-Dawley rats [50].

**RAGE Blockade**

sRAGE has long been used as an inhibitor of RAGE signaling by acting as a receptor decoy. Treatment of diabetic animals with sRAGE prevents Müller glia dysfunction [29] and BRB dysfunction during diabetes [51], and can also prevent retinal capillary leukostasis when normal animals are infused with AGE albumin [39].

Furthermore, several orally delivered small molecules of RAGE such as TTP488 and PF-04494700 have been tested in patients with Alzheimer's disease [52, 53].

RAGE expression can also be inhibited by antioxidant agents such as cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor etodolac [54], the naturally occurring polyphenolic compound grape seed proanthocyanidin extract, and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker olmesartan [55]. RAGE expression can also be reduced by some commonly used diabetes drugs including thiazolidinediones and calcium channel blockers, although their therapeutic effect has not been demonstrated yet [56, 57]. Further investigation of how these drugs may limit RAGE-induced deterioration may be warranted.

Anti-angiogenic Therapy

Angiogenic growth factors probably play a critical role in AGE/RAGE-mediated vascular impairment [58]. Pegaptanib is a nuclease-resistant RNA aptamer directed against VEGF-165, a predominant VEGF isoform that contributes to pathologic ocular neovascularization and vascular permeability [59]. Ranibizumab, a Fab antibody fragment against all isoforms of VEGF, prevents binding of VEGF to its receptors and inhibits angiogenesis in a dose-dependent manner [60]. Bevacizumab (avastin), which is a full-length humanized antibody against all VEGF isoforms and has been US Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of metastatic colorectal cancer [61], shows efficacy for PDR and macular edema [62], although this is not without adverse systemic effects [63]. KIOM-79, a mixture of ethanol extracts from can inhibit VEGF expression in RPE cells treated with high glucose, or RAGE ligands including AGEs and S100B, prevents methylglyoxal-induced retinal pericyte apoptosis through inhibition of oxidative stress in vitro and in vivo [64].

Antioxidant Therapy

Oxidative stress is not only a consequence of AGE-RAGE activation, but is also a potent inducer of RAGE expression. Thus, antioxidants can be used as a strategy for AGE-RAGE-related diseases such as diabetic retinopathy. For example, low-dose erythropoietin inhibits oxidative stress and early vascular changes in the experimental diabetic retina [65]. Olmesartan significantly inhibited AGE-RAGE-induced NF-kB promoter activity and RAGE gene expression in cultured microvascular endothelial cells, and subsequently inhibited autocrine production of VEGF and ROS to exert a protective role against PDR [55]. Minodronate, a newly developed nitrogen-containing bisphosphate, might be a promising remedy for treating patients with diabetic retinopathy by inhibiting the RAGE signaling pathways through suppression of ROS generation via inhibition of Rac prenylation [66]. It was demonstrated that age-related eye disease study-based micronutrients inhibit the development of diabetic retinopathy in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats by inhibiting oxidative and nitrative stress [67].

Conclusions

Diabetic retinopathy is a multifactorial disease involving a variety of pathogenic pathways, of which AGE-RAGE is only one. Nevertheless, over the past two decades, considerable process has been made to reveal the molecular mechanisms responsible for initiation and development diabetic retinopathy. AGE accumulation in retinal cells and RAGE pro-oxidant/proinflammatory signaling is undoubtedly important in diabetic retinopathy. This system could provide useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis predication. Furthermore, as progress in made in blocking RAGE in other neurodegenerative conditions, this axis could provide a useful focus for new therapeutic strategies to prevent diabetic retinopathy in patients.

Diabetologia 2010, 53:2656–2666. This paper demonstrated that RAGE interaction with its ligands plays an important role in retinal glial dysfunction during diabetic retinopathy. RAGE and its ligand S100B were induced by hyperglycemia in Müller glia, in vitro and in vivo. The early induction of S100B/RAGE expression

by hyperglycemia in Muller glia results in the elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines including VEGF and MCP-1, which are key mediators for diabetic retinopathy. This response can be attenuated by sRAGE or RAGE small interfering RNA, implicating the critical role of RAGE in the initiation of diabetic retinopathy.

This paper is important because it evaluated the induction of RAGE and its ligands, S100A8, S100A12, and HMGB1, in human aortic endothelial cells and indicated modulation by ROS. This suggests that ROS cannot only be induced as the end point of RAGE activation, but also act as a positive feedback of RAGE-mediated proinflammatory signaling.
