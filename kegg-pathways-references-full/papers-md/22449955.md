Do cannabinoids reduce brain power?

Bradley E Alger & Ai-Hui Tang

Extracts from the *Cannabis* plants, or cannabinoids, bind to the same receptors as do endogenous cannabinoids. Although usually found on nerve terminals, where their activation inhibits transmitter release, cannabinoid receptors are now reported to exist on mitochondria, where their activation by endocannabinoids regulates energy metabolism.

Like gas-guzzling cars, brains use much more energy than their size alone would seem to justify. Unlike gas guzzlers, however, brains use energy efficiently. The brain's energy, in the form of ATP, must be supplied by mitochondria. As a result, the brain is highly sensitive to mitochondrial dysfunction, and many neurological diseases or aging-related neurological disorders are associated with mitochondria¹. Although commonly called the cell's power plants, mitochondria are also involved in a variety of other metabolism-related functions, such as regulation of membrane potentials and Ca²⁺ signals that participate in synaptic plasticity. Recently, the endocannabinoid system (ECS) has emerged as a ubiquitous and potent overseer of neuronal synaptic communication. In this issue of *Nature Neuroscience*, Bénard *et al.*² find that its influence extends to the control of neuronal energy metabolism.

Endocannabinoids (eCBs), mainly 2-arachidonyl glycerol (2-AG) and anandamide, are endogenous agonists of the same receptors that bind the psychoactive ingredient in the *Cannabis* plant, Δ⁹-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The ECS comprises these eCB ligands, their synthetic and degradative enzymes and transporters³, and G protein-coupled cannabinoid receptors. The main cannabinoid receptors of the brain, CB1s, are neuronal plasma membrane receptors (pmCB1s) that are usually found on or near presynaptic axon terminals, where they encounter eCBs that are synthesized and released from postsynaptic neurons. Once activated, pmCB1s initiate signaling cascades that inhibit synaptic transmitter release. The typical ECS actions therefore represent a retrograde signaling process⁴.

When they were first detected in the membranes of intracellular organelles⁵, it was assumed that CB1s were simply in the process of being transported between the cell body and the distal processes (dendrites and axon). The internal CB1s were not initially observed in mitochondria, and their C termini were oriented toward the cytosol, as would be expected if they were destined for insertion into the plasma membrane through an exocytotic mechanism. In contrast, Bénard *et al.*² found that a large fraction (~15%) of all CB1s are present in mitochondrial outer membranes with their C termini facing the interior of the organelle, as if they serve a mitochondrial signaling function. Indeed, 30% of neuronal mitochondria carry CB1s (mtCB1s), and both THC and eCBs suppress electron transport complex I activity and respiration in isolated mitochondria (Fig. 1), probably by reducing cAMP levels and protein kinase A (PKA) activity.

Bénard *et al.*² teased apart the contributions of mtCB1s and pmCB1s using innovative methods, and tightly controlled all experiments by comparing tissues from normal and CB1-null mice. Classical CB1 agonists and antagonists are lipophilic compounds that have equal access to internal and external receptors. The experimental strategy compared the actions of the classical drugs with those of membrane-impermeant ligands that could only bind to pmCB1s; the difference should reflect the contribution of mtCB1s. Indeed, in intact cells, the impermeant CB1 peptide antagonist (inverse agonist) hemopressin⁶ fully blocked pmCB1 actions while leaving the depression of mitochondrial respiration by membrane-permeant CB1 agonists unimpaired. Parallel tests with a new membrane-impermeant CB1 agonist, HU-biot, which was made by attaching a biotin moiety to the membrane-permeant agonist HU210, revealed that, unlike HU210, HU-biot did not reduce cellular respiration. Hemopressin and HU-biot were fully effective in permeabilized cells, so the results reflected differences in intracellular access and not in efficacy.

Evidently, exogenous cannabinoids can activate mtCB1s and regulate mitochondrial function. Can eCBs do the same? There are two ways to elevate eCB levels: enhancing eCB synthesis or inhibiting eCB degradation. Although fatty acid amide hydrolase, the primary degradative enzyme for anandamide, is known to be densely present in the mitochondria, Bénard *et al.*² found that purified mitochondria also have substantial 2-AG-degrading activity that was attributable to monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL). When MAGL was inhibited in the purified mitochondrial preparation, the amount of mitochondrial 2-AG present was increased and respiration was suppressed; the higher the 2-AG, the lower the respiration. Thus, eCBs must be generated in, or in close association with, mitochondria and be capable of downregulating respiration by activating mtCB1s. Convincing evidence thus ties mtCB1s to the suppression of mitochondrial energy metabolism in isolated mitochondria.

What happens in intact neurons? Depolarization-induced suppression of inhibition (DSI) is produced when depolarization of a postsynaptic cell opens voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels and thereby triggers synthesis and release of eCBs in proportion to the strength of the depolarization. A brief (1 s) depolarization to 0 mV triggers a modest amount of Ca²⁺ influx and a short-lasting, weak DSI, whereas a longer (5 s) depolarization to 0 mV triggers greater Ca²⁺ influx and strong DSI having greater magnitude and longer duration. DSI reflects a CB1-mediated depression of GABA

Figure 1 Model of pmCB1s and mtCB1s in presynaptic nerve terminals. Stimulation is represented by solid arrows and inhibition by dotted lines. Postsynaptic depolarization induces Ca²⁺ influx and the subsequent activation of DGLα results in 2-AG synthesis and release. 2-AG is degraded by MAGL in mitochondria and other presynaptic intracellular compartments. Weak DSI produces only enough 2-AG for pmCB1 activation; strong DSI generates enough to also activate mtCB1s. Stimulation of pmCB1 reduces transmitter release mainly by inhibiting presynaptic, voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (not shown). Stimulation of mtCB1 inhibits the cAMP-PKA pathway and thereby inhibits the activity of complex I in the electron transport chain. The resulting reduction of mitochondrial respiration triggers further inhibition of transmitter release through an unknown mechanism. Complex I can also be inhibited by rotenone. Membrane permeant agonists such as HU210 or antagonists such as AM251 gain access to both pmCB1s and mtCB1s. However, hemopressin, a membrane-impermeant CB1 antagonist, prevents eCB effects only partially because it inhibits only pmCB1s. Similarly, the membrane-impermeant CB1 agonist HU-biot activates only pmCB1s and so cannot completely occlude eCB-mediated effects if mtCB1s are involved.

release and is a well-established bioassay of eCB effects³⁴. In hippocampal slices, HU210 completely occluded strong DSI, whereas HU-biot only partially occluded it. Similarly, hemopressin partially reduced strong DSI, whereas the membrane-permeant CB1 antagonist AM251 abolished it. Finally, rotenone, a synthetic mitochondrial complex I inhibitor, was ineffective on strong DSI, but enhanced weak DSI. These differences suggest that weak and strong DSI differ both qualitatively and quantitatively. Because rotenone suppresses mitochondrial function maximally, perhaps the component of strong DSI that is attributable to mtCB1s was occluded. Weak DSI does not, in this interpretation, involve mtCB1s, and it could be enhanced when rotenone reduced mitochondrial function. Thus, by suppressing mitochondrial complex I activity, mtCB1s potentiate the plasma membrane eCB actions, although the details of the potentiation mechanism remain to be determined. The predicted decrease in ATP could alter the energy supplies, Ca²⁺ levels or redox potentials conducive to neurotransmitter release. Nevertheless, the main results supported the hypothesis that mtCB1s depress mitochondrial respiration and somehow enhance physiological eCB-mediated responses.

Inevitably, findings as novel as these are accompanied by some loose ends. Perhaps the most startling result was that, in intact cells, direct pharmacological activation of mtCBs (that is, not involving eCBs generated during DSI) did not influence synaptic transmission at all. This can be inferred from the observation that the agonists HU210 and HU-biot were equally effective at suppressing basal synaptic transmission. If HU210 had stimulated both pmCB1s and mtCB1s, it should have had a more pronounced effect than HU-biot, which affects only pmCB1s. Similarly, hemopressin prevented the suppression of basal transmission by either HU210 or HU-biot, which apparently rules out a role for mtCB1s in this case. Finally, the finding that rotenone neither reduced basal GABA release nor potentiated the actions of HU-biot is most unexpected if the mtCB1-induced interference with mitochondrial function *per se* is the key step. Clearly, something is missing. Rotenone provides the only link between mtCB1s and eCBs, and the involvement of other internal GB1s, which could also have been affected by membrane-permeant ligands, has not been ruled out. Alternatively, as the authors hint, it might be that the strong DSI mechanism requires more than simply the action of released eCBs on presynaptic CB1s. The postsynaptic depolarization and Ca²⁺ influx that initiates eCB mobilization for DSI might do other things, perhaps release another factor having detectable actions only when mitochondrial function is simultaneously reduced (could nitric oxide³ re-emerge as a player?). These results provide a rough outline of things to come, rather than a detailed mechanistic diagram. Exogenously applying eCBs, or releasing them by postsynaptic uncaging of caged Ca²⁺, could help sort things out. Other tests could involve activation of metabotropic receptors for glutamate, acetylcholine, dopamine and a host of other G protein-coupled receptors that release eCBs by means of relatively Ca²⁺-insensitive (and depolarization independent) mechanisms³.

Assuming that these issues can be resolved, what are some implications of the regulation of neuronal energy supplies by mtCB1s? A tantalizing lead implies that mitochondria not only respond to eCBs, but can regulate or even produce them. Appreciable MAGL activity and amounts of 2-AG were detected² in purified mitochondria, and inhibiting the enzyme substantially increased 2-AG. Where does mitochondrial 2-AG come from, and what does it normally do? The primary synthetic enzyme for 2-AG, diacylglycerol lipase α (DGLα), has not been reported to exist in neuronal mitochondria, but this could change. In any case, ~20% of 2-AG in the brain is independent of DGLα⁷⁻⁹; thus, 2-AG in mitochondria could be accounted for by other synthetic activity. Whatever its source and whatever its other functions, however, mitochondrial 2-AG can activate mtCB1 and suppress cellular respiration, which could be an important factor in synaptic regulation and other physiological functions.

Quantitative differences in CB1 activation can give rise to qualitative differences in eCB-mediated responses. For example, eCBs regulate synaptic transmitter release on both short and long time scales. DSI and similar phenomena last for seconds to minutes, but eCB-mediated long-term depression of synaptic transmission is much more enduring. Although both short-term and long-term

forms of eCB-mediated synaptic plasticity are induced by CB1s, DSI can be initiated in less than 1 s, whereas induction of long-term depression requires CB1 activation persisting for several minutes<sup>10</sup>. PKA and cAMP are involved in the transition from short-term to long-term eCB-dependent plasticity, although what factors actually control the transition are still obscure. Exploration of the role of mtCB1s in this process might prove rewarding.

Cannabis derivatives and the ECS are being investigated for their physiological effects and therapeutic potential in a variety of phenomena. An important tactic is to enhance the levels of eCBs, which are physiologically produced when and where needed, by interfering with their degradation<sup>11</sup>. How will regulation of mitochondrial respiration by cannabinoids alter our interpretations of the problems and answers arising from these studies? It was recently shown that neurotoxic damage inflicted by kainic acid is greater in mice lacking CB1 than in wild-type mice<sup>12</sup>; evidently, kainic acid induces eCB synthesis and release, and the

resulting CB1 activation is neuroprotective. However, mitochondrial functional insufficiency contributes to the extent of stroke-induced neurological damage<sup>2</sup>. It seems that eCBs released during neurocytotoxic insult could also, by suppressing mitochondria, oppose the neuroprotective effect and exacerbate the lesion, with the ultimate outcome depending on a balance of the two tendencies. Therapeutic approaches that increase eCB availability by decreasing eCB degradation may not avoid such complexities.

Finally, certain diseases or other maladies are accompanied by upregulation of the ECS; examples include behavioral stress<sup>13</sup>, fragile X syndrome<sup>14,15</sup> and Parkinson's disease<sup>2</sup>. Mitochondrial dysfunction has been suspected as an etiopathological cofactor in many of these cases<sup>2</sup>. If upregulation of eCBs downregulates mitochondrial respiration, then eCBs and mtCB1s could link certain disease states with mitochondrial dysfunction. These and other implications of the work by Bénard *et al.* will surely energize future investigations of the ECS.

**Sensing the long and the short of it**

How do sensory systems encode prolonged stimuli? A study reveals molecular and circuit mechanisms by which *C. elegans* interprets oxygen concentration to produce both transient and long-lasting behaviors.

Sights, sounds and smells flood our senses. Whether punctual or persistent, most of these signals are rapidly ignored or cause us to react only briefly. We need to keep pace with new information in the environment rather than hold onto the old. Our sensory systems achieve this through adaptation mechanisms that turn off (or at least reduce) the activity of individual proteins, signaling pathways and neural networks.

Certain stimuli hold our attention, however, such as those causing us harm; consider the consequences of pain subsiding even as your hand remains on a hotplate. Internal sensory cues, such as body temperature, must also be constantly monitored. Neurons that exhibit sustained, or tonic, responses to sensory stimuli have been identified electrophysiologically throughout the nervous system; they include peripheral nociceptors and mechanoreceptors and internal, homeostatic temperature or pH sensors. How do these neurons generate constant activity over many minutes or hours? How can this prolonged activity produce meaningful behavioral responses?

In this issue of *Nature Neuroscience*, Busch *et al.*<sup>1</sup> answer these questions through their characterization of tonic receptors, the O<sub>2</sub>-sensing neurons in the nematode worm *Caenorhabditis elegans*. They identify the molecular components in sensory neurons that are required to generate tonic signals to downstream circuitry, and they characterize how these sustained signals are transformed in different types of interneurons to elicit both short- and long-term behavioral changes (*Fig.* 1).

Sliding through microbe-rich rotting fruit or hitchhiking on snails<sup>2,3</sup>, *C. elegans* is likely to be exposed to O<sub>2</sub> concentrations ranging from near-anoxia to atmospheric values (21%). In the laboratory, this tiny worm prefers 5–10% O<sub>2</sub> (ref. 4), probably because this range optimizes internal O<sub>2</sub> concentrations to be sufficient for cellular respiration while avoiding excess oxidative stress<sup>5</sup>. When exposed to higher or lower O<sub>2</sub> concentrations, *C. elegans* displays several behavioral responses, including changes in speed, turns and reversals, which together may help the worm to navigate through O<sub>2</sub> gradients<sup>4,6</sup>. High O<sub>2</sub> concentration also promotes aggregation, as worms can collectively reduce the concentration of O<sub>2</sub> when clustered<sup>4,7</sup>.

Although ambient conditions may vary markedly over short timescales, *C. elegans* probably often finds itself in fairly stable O<sub>2</sub> conditions. Busch *et al.*<sup>1</sup> began by asking whether the worms' behavior can be persistently set by the level of O<sub>2</sub> in their environment. Under optimal conditions (7% O<sub>2</sub>), worms moved slowly and dwelt locally, but when exposed to undesirably high concentrations (21% O<sub>2</sub>), they immediately started to move faster (perhaps in their vain attempt to seek more comfortable O<sub>2</sub> levels within the assay arena). Notably, the worms never slowed down in high O<sub>2</sub>, even after 2 h, and only decelerated once their preferred 7% O<sub>2</sub> was restored.

Two mechanisms might explain this behavior: O<sub>2</sub> sensors could be transiently activated but induce persistent physiological changes in downstream interneurons to cause long-lasting (but reversible) changes in locomotion, or the
