*Xylella fastidiosa* (*X.f.*) is a plant pathogen with high levels of genomic similarity to *Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris* (*X.c.c.*). It has been shown that *X. fastidiosa* synthesizes a putative diffusible signal factor (*X.f.-DSF*) that activates regulation of pathogenicity factor (*rpf*) genes in a *X.c.c.* reporter system, which might be involved in the regulation of pathogenesis-associated genes as in *X.c.c.*, as well as in quorum-sensing. The nature of the *X.f.-DSF* is not known, whereas the *X.c.c.-DSF* has been identified as cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid. In this work, the chemical nature of a putative *X.f.-DSF* molecule, able to restore endoglucanase activity in a *X.c.c. rpfF* mutant, was investigated as if it was a fatty acid derivative. Bioassays with *X.c.c.* reporter bacterium and *X.f.* culture extracts, based on endoglucanase restoration activity, were also carried out in order to confirm the DSFs molecules similarities. For this reason, a gas chromatography–mass spectrometry method was developed with standard fatty acids methyl esters mixtures. The retention time, as well as the fragmentation patterns, of each standard was used to identify the DSF molecule synthesized by *X.f.* in the culture medium. Typical ester fragmentation patterns (the derivatized analyte) were observed, such as: McLafferty rearrangement and migration of the Hδ followed by 1,4-hydrogen shift and cleavage of the bond Cβ–Cγ, confirming the nature of this molecule. This confirmation was corroborated by the common peaks in both spectra. Besides, the observed retention time reinforces our conclusion since it corresponds to a methyl ester with 15 carbons. Since the *X.f.-DSF* molecule was tentatively identified as 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid (by mass spectra library comparison), this standard compound was also analyzed, strongly suggesting that this is the identification of such a molecule. To our knowledge, this is the first time a DSF produced by *X.f.* has been characterized.

### INTRODUCTION

*Xylella fastidiosa* (*X.f.*) is a gram-negative xylem-limited bacterium that causes diseases in several crop plants, such as citrus (citrus variegated chlorosis, CVC), grapevines (Pierce’s disease),$^{3-5}$ coffee (Coffee leaf scorch),$^{6}$ peach (Phony disease of peach), plum (Plum leaf scald),$^{7}$ and others.$^{8}$ The genome of *X.f.* has been completely sequenced.$^{1,2}$ Several *X.f.* genes show high levels of similarity to several *X.c.c.* genes, including genes associated with the synthesis and perception of a signal molecule that regulates the expression of pathogenicity factors such as plant cell wall-degrading enzymes and extracellular polysaccharides (EPS).$^{1}$

It seems that a minimum *X.f.* cellular density in the host xylem needs to be reached so that CVC symptoms are observed. This fact strongly suggests that pathogenicity factors synthesis is dependent on a quorum-sensing mechanism.$^{9}$ The term quorum-sensing is used to describe a gene expression regulation mechanism according to cell population density fluctuation. Bacteria which present this mechanism produce and release signaling molecules called autoinducers or diffusible signal factors (DSF), which increase their concentration according to population density.$^{10,11}$ In general, DSF may be chemically classified according to Gram's stain. Thus, gram-positive bacteria generally use peptides or amino acids as signaling molecules while gram-negative ones usually produce fatty acid derivatives, such as N-acyl homoserine lactones derivatives.$^{12}$

*Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris* (*X.c.c.*), the causal agent of black rot disease, presents a quorum-sensing mechanism and the DSF synthesis is regulated by the regulation of pathogenicity factor (*rpf*) gene cluster.$^{13,14}$ Production of xanthan gum,$^{15}$ extracellular enzymes,$^{16}$ and cyclic glucones$^{17}$ are regulated by *X.c.c.* DSF and contribute to disease virulence. *X.c.c.* DSF chemical structure was

recently identified as cis-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid, an α-β unsaturated fatty acid, which constitutes a novel class of cell–cell communication signaling molecules.¹⁸

In X.f., the genes highly homologous to *rpf* genes, including *rpfB* and *rpfF*, have been identified: amino acid sequence similarities between all the genes which are represented in both chromosomes is very high: BLASTP E values comparisons were all less than 10⁻⁹⁹ and homologies exist throughout the length of the proteins.¹⁹ These genes have also been shown to be expressed *in vitro*, suggesting that this bacterium is able to synthesize a DSF similar to the X.c.c.-DSF.⁹,²⁰ In fact, using bioassays with a X.c.c. *rpfF* mutant responsive to exogenous DSF, it has been shown that ethyl acetate extracts of acellular X.f. culture medium are able to restore endoglucanase activity in the reporter system.⁹ In addition, the synthesis of X.f.-DSF in culture medium was higher at early stationary phase of growth, decreasing later, suggesting the accumulation of this signal molecule in the culture medium is cell density dependent. The data also showed that the ability of the X.f.-DSF to restore endoglucanase activity in the X.c.c. reporter system was approximately 14-fold lower than the X.c.c.-DSF, further suggesting that X.f. secretes lower amounts of the DSF in the culture medium, as compared to X.c.c., or that the activities of both signal molecules in the report system are distinct, owing to differences in chemical structure.²¹

Since the genes essential for the biosynthesis of X.c.c.-DSF, i.e. *rpfB* and *rpfF*, are also expressed in DSF producing X.f. cells grown in culture medium, and exogenous X.f.-DSF can, at least partially, complement the X.c.c. mutants unable to synthesize DSF, we can hypothesize that X.f.-DSF is a fatty acid derivative as is the case with X.c.c.-DSF. In this work, ethyl acetate extracts of acellular X.f. culture supernatants were derivatized and analyzed by high-resolution gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (HRGC-MS).

### EXPERIMENTAL

#### Materials and reagents
Hexane and ethyl acetate of HPLC grade were bought from Mallinckrodt (Paris, KY). 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid methyl ester, tridecanoic acid and BF₃ : CH₃OH (10% v/v) were acquired from Aldrich (St Louis, MO) and standard fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs) mixtures were from Supelco (Bellefonte, PA). Mixture 1 was composed of methyl esters from: myristic acid (C14:0–4%), palmitic acid (C16:0–10%), stearic acid (C18:0–6%), oleic acid (C18:1, cis-9–25%), elaidic acid (C18:1, trans-9–10%), linoleic acid (C18:2, cis-9,12–34%), linolenaidic acid (C18:2, trans-9,12–2%), linolenic acid (C18:3, cis-9,1,15–5%), arachidic acid (C20:0–2%) and behenic acid (C22:0–2%). Mixture 2 was composed of methyl esters from: caprilic acid (C8:0–8%), capric acid (C10:0–8%), lauric acid (C12:0–8%), myristic acid (C14:0–8%), palmitic acid (C16:0–11%), palmitoleic acid (C16:1, cis-9–5%), stearic acid (C18:0–8%), oleic acid (C18:1, cis-9–5%), linoleic acid (C18:2, cis-9,12–5%), linolenic acid (C18:3, cis-9,12,15–5%), arachidic acid (C20:0–8%), behenic acid (C22:0–8%), erucic acid (C22:1, cis-13–5%) and lignoceric acid (C24:0–8%).

Anhydrous sodium sulfate was from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany) and the water used for all experiments was purified in a Milli-Q system (Millipore, Bedford, MA).

#### X.f. culture and DSF extraction
X.f. strain 9a5c was grown in modified Periwinkle wilt (PW) liquid medium as described by Scarpari *et al.*⁹ DSF extraction was carried out by liquid–liquid extraction of 25 ml acellular culture supernatant and 0.3 volume of ethyl acetate. The organic phase was evaporated to dryness and dissolved in 100 μl of deionized water. This extract was used in both GC-MS experiments and bioassays, which were based on restoration of endoglucanase activity of a X.c.c. *rpf* mutant bacterium.¹³ A culture medium was also extracted and used as a control.

#### Instrumental apparatus
HRGC-MS analyses were carried out in a QP5050A gas chromatograph (Shimadzu, Kyoto–Japan) with a Croma-5-5% phenyl, 95% poly(dimethylsiloxane) capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.30 μm stationary phase film thickness) Nanoseparation Technology (NST), São Carlos, Brazil. Helium was used as the carrier gas. Mass spectrometry ionization was carried out by electron ionization (70 eV) and ions were analyzed by a quadrupole in a scan rate of 1 scan s⁻¹.

#### Standard and sample derivatization
Tridecanoic acid (5 mg l⁻¹), X.f. extract and control sample (100 μl) were dried in a sand bath (45 °C) in glass vials. The derivatization agent BF₃ : CH₃OH (500 μl) was added to the vials and the reaction was carried out at 45 °C for 15 min. The reaction was interrupted by addition of 500 μl of water and 500 μl of hexane. The organic layer was removed and this operation was carried out three times. Residual water from the combined organic layers was removed with anhydrous sodium sulfate. The obtained methyl esters were analyzed by HRGC-MS.

#### HRGC-MS analyses
The derivatized samples, the standard FAMEs mixtures and the 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid meyhyl ester (1 mg l⁻¹ in methanol) standard were analyzed by HRGC-MS. Sample injection was carried in splitless mode (1 μl⁻¹ 1 min) at 250 °C. A temperature gradient was applied during the analysis from 120 °C (2 min) to 270 °C at 6 °C min⁻¹. The interface temperature was held at 280 °C. The carrier gas flow was 1.3 ml min⁻¹. Ions obtained by electron ionization were monitored in both full scan mode (50–400 Da) and selected ion monitoring mode (*m/z* 74 and 87). NIST 62 library aided peaks identification.

### RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Firstly, production of DSF by the investigated X.f. strain was confirmed by bioassay in plates containing carboxymethyl-cellulose, as presented by Scarpari *et al.*⁹ The results showed that X.f. produced small halos around the X.c.c. bacterium reporter isolates, which indicates that it secreted a molecule

that was able to slightly restore endoglucanase activity in X.c.c. This fact suggests that *X.f.* synthesizes a DSF molecule similar but not equal to the X.c.c. one.

Both FAMEs mixtures were analyzed by HRGC-MS in order to optimize the best condition of analysis and to compare the standards' retention times with those of the sample. Figures 1 and 3 present the total ion chromatogram (TIC), extracted ion chromatograms (EICs) and a representative mass spectrum of mixtures 1 and 2, respectively.

Analysis of FAMEs standard mixture 1 presented eight peaks out of ten components in the mixture, which are better observed in the *m/z* 74 and 87 EICs (Fig. 1(B)). The structural similarity of the C18 isomers (linolelaidic and linolenic acids methyl esters) prevented a good chromatographic separation and they were not differentiated by mass spectrometry. Figure 1(C) presents the methyl tetradecanoate mass spectrum (*M*⁺• 242) which shows characteristic ions and respective abundances for the fragmentation of esters with an alkyl saturated chain. The ion [M-31]⁺, in *m/z* 211, is generated by the loss of a methoxyl group (CH₃O•) while the ion [M-43]⁺, in *m/z* 199, is due to the loss of a propyl radical (CH₃CH₂CH₂•) by a six-member ring transition rearrangement between carbons α and γ to the carbonyl group. Ions *m/z* 185, 171, 157, 143, 129, 115, 101 and 87 are produced by the carbon backbone fragmentation seen as 28 Da losses from the ester alkyl chain homologous series. Ion *m/z* 87 production mechanism is useful for Cβ functionality determination since it arises through initial migration of the Hδ followed by 1,4-hydrogen shift and cleavage of the bond Cβ–Cγ (Fig. 2(A)).²² Fragment ion *m/z* 74, which is the ultimate ion for the selective detection of most fatty acid derivatives, is produced by the McLafferty rearrangement

in which the Hγ migrates to the carbonyl group through a six-member transition state (Fig. 2(B)).²³

FAMEs standard mixture 2 was composed of 14 esters, of which 12 could be detected. The methyl octonoate peak was not observed because of the solvent delay (5 min) since the first detected peak (methyl decanoate) was eluted at 5.113 min. On the other hand, linolenic acid methyl ester was not detected probably due to coelution with the other peaks from C18 series, which was also observed for mixture 1. The selected ions for EICs were *m/z* 74 and 55 (Fig. 3(B)) since this mixture contains esters with unsaturated alkyl chain, which shows higher intensity towards these ions (alkenes homologous series). The mass spectrum of palmitoleic methyl ester (Fig. 3(C)) shows a molecular ion peak (*M*⁺• 268) with lower intensity than that of the respective saturated alkyl chain. A characteristic ion is [M-116]⁺• (*m/z* 152), which arises by a fragment loss, containing the carbonyl group, from the cleavage between C5–C6 and addition of a rearranged hydrogen atom. Ions *m/z* 141, 124, 110, 97, 83, 69, 55 e 41 refers to the alkene homologous series.

Initially, *X.f.* extracts were analyzed by HPLC (data not presented) in order to obtain pure compounds from the whole sample by collecting 1 ml fractions (injection of 100 µl of sample and mobile phase flow = 1 ml min⁻¹). Tridecanoic acid standard solution (100 mg l⁻¹) and the control sample were analyzed as well, and the latter presented a different chromatographic profile. However, fatty acids do not present chromophores, which would allow their UV-visible detection. For this reason, the collected fractions were derivatized (as presented in the experimental section) with addition of tridecanoic acid (final concentration of 5 mg l⁻¹) as an internal standard to the bacterium fractions and analyzed by HRGC-MS. This fatty acid was added to the fractions in

order to check the effect on sample manipulation and the effectiveness of the derivatization step. Only the tridecanoic acid methyl ester chromatographic peak could be observed in the X.f. and control samples; on the other hand, HRGC-MS analyses of tridecanoic acid derivatized HPLC fractions revealed that only fraction 45 (when the mobile phase contained 90% of organic solvent) presented the tridecanoic acid methyl ester peak ($t_r = 10.448$ min), by selected ion monitoring (SIM), which is more sensitive than the TIC (Fig. 4). Therefore, the HPLC and derivatization steps, as well as the sample manipulation, were resulting in losses and excessive sample dilution since the tridecanoic acid final concentration was 0.33 mg l⁻¹. Besides, bacteria synthesize extremely low amount of metabolites, such as DSF, which would probably not be detected under these conditions.

Analyses of derivatized unfractionated X.f. extract and its respective control were then carried out by HRGC-MS, without the HPLC step (Fig. 5). Tridecanoic acid internal standard was not added to these samples since a possible coelution with any sample compound could have occurred.

The sample chromatogram (Fig. 5(A)) shows a peak at 13.6 min, which is not observed in the control (Fig. 5(B)). This peak presents a retention time higher than methyl tridecanoate and methyl tetradecanoate ones ($t_r = 10.448$ min – Fig. 4(A) and $t_r = 12.308$ min – Fig. 1(B), respectively). Nevertheless methyl 9-cis-hexadecenoate ($t_r = 15.510$ min – Fig. 3(B)) presents a higher retention time, which means that the investigated peak must be a methyl ester with a C-15 alkyl chain. A peak at ca 15.2 min is also present

in the sample chromatogram, but not in the control. However this retention time is very close to an ester with a 16-carbons alkyl chain and for this reason was not considered as a possible X.f. DSF molecule.

The mass spectrum of the investigated peak (Fig. 6(A)) shows 85% similarity to 12-methyl-tetradecanoate methyl ester (Fig. 6(B)) according to NIST 62 MS library. The data was treated with subtraction of the baseline but, even then, the spectrum background presented a high signal-to-noise ratio due to the extremely low concentration of the analyte in the sample. The molecular ion intensity of methyl esters increases with the molecular mass and decreases with the alkyl chain branching.²² In esters with branched alkyl chain, two characteristic fragments are generated according to the side of the branching where the cleavage occurs, namely, ions 'a' and 'b'. Ion 'a' does not contain the branching and is closer to the carbonyl group while ion 'b' is obtained by cleavage before the branching and is more distant to the carbonyl group. Ions 'a' may also be observed as 'a + 1' and 'a + 2' and ions 'b' as the diagnostic ions [b-32]⁺ (after methanol loss) or [b-50]⁺ (for further loss of water).²⁴ The preferential cleavage of tertiary carbons in esters with branched alkyl chain results in higher abundance of the CH₃CO(CH₂)ₙ⁺ fragments series, such as: m/z 87, 143 e 199, for n = 1, 5 and 9, respectively. In the methyl tetradecanoate-methyl ester mass spectrum (Fig. 6(B)) inspection, ions 'a' and 'b' may be observed by the loss of 29 and 43 Da from the radical molecular ion (M⁺• 256), respectively. The diagnostic ion [b-50]⁺ is also observed at m/z 177. Ions produced by tertiary carbon cleavage are underlined as well as those of the McLafferty's rearrangement (m/z 74). The cleavage of the alkyl chain homologous series is indicated by the arrows (loss of 28 Da) and generates the ions: m/z 157, 143, 129, 115, 101 and 87. Ions m/z 43 (COCH₃⁺) and 57 (COCH₂CH₃⁺) are

among the most intense ones and are characteristic of methyl esters.

Hence, the standard compound of the probable analyte (12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid methyl ester) was analyzed under the same conditions. The retention time was within the window of ca 1% of standard deviation (13.4 min against 13.6 min–investigated peak in the sample), and the mass spectrum presented higher similarity to the sample than the one from NIST library (Fig. 6(C)). The authors hypothesize that the probability of a ramification in another carbon on the alkyl chain, such as C13, could lead to this lack of identicalness. Coincidentally, Urbina N.D. has identified many bacteria that produce this fatty acid, such as: *Bacillus brevis*, *Bacillus megaterium*, *Escherichia coli*, *Micrococcus luteus*, *Staphylococcus aureus*, and others.^[25]^

For this reason it is proposed herein that the DSF molecule produced *in vitro* by *X.f.* bacterium may be 12-methyl-tetradecanoic acid. This molecule differentiates from the one produced by *X.c.c.* bacterium by the alkyl chain length and the absence of a double bond, as shown in Fig. 7.

### CONCLUSIONS

Investigation of *X.f.* DSF molecule was based on the hypothesis that it is a fatty acid, since *X.c.c.* bacterium, which presents high genomic similarity, synthesizes *cis*-11-methyl-2-dodecenoic acid molecule as a signaling molecule for the quorum-sensing mechanism. For this reason, a HRGC-MS method was developed for FAMEs mixtures and methyl tridecanoate analysis in order to characterize the *X.f.* DSF molecule after culture extract derivatization. The chromatographic peak identified as the target analyte presented the
