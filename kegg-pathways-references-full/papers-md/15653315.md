**Antigen presentation and recognition in bacterial infections**

Stefan HE Kaufmann and Ulrich E Schaible

---

Antigen processing and recognition is a key feature of antibacterial immune responses to intracellular bacteria. In contrast to viruses, which are primarily controlled by conventional MHC II- and MHC I-restricted CD4⁺ or CD8⁺ T cells, respectively, unconventional T cells participate additionally in antibacterial protection. These unconventional T cells include glycolipid-specific CD1-restricted T cells and phospholigand-specific γδ T cells. We are just beginning to understand the broad spectrum of antigen recognition and stimulation of distinct T-cell populations by bacterial pathogens. From the host perspective, a broad spectrum of different T-cell populations that recognize proteins, lipids and carbohydrates strengthens protective immunity. From the perspective of the pathogen, antigen presentation represents a bottleneck that should be exploited for evasion from, or devastation of, acquired immunity. Although several such mechanisms have been described in viral systems, few have thus far been elucidated in bacterial infections.

**Introduction**

Microbial pathogens have devised two main strategies to promote their replication in the host [1,2]. The first strategy involves overwhelming the host by rapid replication, thereby devastating, or evading, innate immune responses so that the pathogen is transmitted to the next host before acquired immunity has been established in the original one. Agents of this type include *Corynebacterium diphtheriae* and *Bordetella pertussis*, the etiologic agents of diphtheria and pertussis, respectively, as well as other causative agents of bacterial infections in the upper respiratory and gastrointestinal tract. For these microorganisms, antigen presentation and recognition are of minor importance because their hit-and-run strategy allows them to be rapidly spread to the next host. If for some reason they still exist in the host after acquired immune responses are initiated, they are generally eradicated rapidly. Highly efficient vaccines against these acute infections provide an instructive example for this notion.

The second strategy concerns pathogens that cause chronic infections and have to spend a lot of energy on evading attack by the acquired immune response. These pathogens often persist in the host for long periods of time without causing active disease; illness is frequently the possible, but not essential, consequence of infection [1,3]. Some pathogens exploit immuno-privileged sites in the extracellular milieu, which allows their persistence, whereas others preferentially inhabit the inside of host cells. The group of extracellular pathogens includes *Helicobacter pylori*, which live in the stomach, and *Borrelia burgdorferi*, which hide within joints, muscles and the nervous system. The intracellular group includes *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the etiological agent of tuberculosis.

Of course, these different survival strategies are not mutually exclusive. First, some intracellular bacteria cause acute infectious diseases, such as *Legionella pneumophila* and *Listeria monocytogenes*, the etiological agents of Legionnaires’ disease and listeriosis, respectively. Second, the typhoid-causing *Salmonella enterica* lives mainly intracellularly within macrophages during infection and disease but persists extracellularly in the gall bladder of healthy individuals who are chronic excretors. Recently, the extracellular persistence of *L. monocytogenes* in the gall bladder of mice and the intracellular survival of *H. pylori* have been described [4,5]. Obviously, the intracellular habitat protects against antibodies, and therefore T lymphocytes are critical for defence. Accordingly, for intracellular bacteria, antigen presentation has a vital role in T-cell stimulation, and both host and pathogen have focused a large part of their survival strategies on this mechanism.

**The broad spectrum of T-cell populations in antibacterial immunity**

Classical MHC molecules, that is, class I and II, present antigenic peptides to T cells. The now classical segregation

tion of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells as critical for bacterial or viral infections, respectively, was derived from the notion that intracellular bacteria typically survive inside phagosomal compartments with access to the MHC II molecules, which are responsible for peptide presentation to CD4⁺ T cells. By contrast, viruses are newly generated by the protein-synthesis machinery within various host cells; that is, the cytoplasm and the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Hence, viral peptides can be readily loaded onto MHC I molecules, which present them to CD8⁺ T cells. Accordingly, the intracellular habitat of the pathogen dictates the type of T-cell population responsible for protection. We now know that not only CD4⁺ T cells but also CD8⁺ T cells participate in acquired immunity to numerous intracellular bacteria. These bacteria include not only those that egress from the phagosome into the cytosol and hence can be termed cytosolic pathogens, such as *L. monocytogenes*, but also the so-called phagosomal bacteria, which remain in the phagosome. In fact, studies in recent years have provided a deeper insight into how antigens from phagosomal bacteria can be presented to CD8⁺ T cells by cross-priming and cross-presentation pathways (Figure 1).

Moreover, it is well known that, in addition to the conventional CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, unconventional T cells participate in protection against intracellular bacteria. Antigen presentation for these T cells is achieved by

The two major pathways of MHC I antigen processing for CD8⁺ T cells in infections with phagosomal bacteria. Until recently, the way in which antigens from phagosomal bacteria enter the MHC I pathway was mysterious. Now, two not mutually exclusive pathways have been elucidated.

(a) Cross presentation describes how antigens from phagosomal bacteria are introduced to MHC I molecules in the same cell. ER membranes are recruited to the phagocytic cup; thereby the machinery for MHC class I processing and presentation, such as TAP, proteasomes and MHC I, is brought into close proximity to the intracellular bacterium. This allows peptide loading of MHC I molecules within the phagosome. Bacterial proteins shuttle to the cytoplasm through Sec 61 for processing by proteasomes and are transported back into the phagosome by TAP. It should be noted here that a recent study also showed other intracellular membranes such those from late endosomes to be recruited to the phagocytic cup [55], suggesting that the phagocyte uses different membrane sources for phagocytosis.

(b) Cross priming describes how antigens from infected macrophages are translocated to DCs in the vicinity. This pathway involves the apoptosis of infected macrophages, formation of apoptotic blebs containing bacterial antigens, uptake of these blebs and introduction of their antigenic cargo to MHC I molecules in DCs. Infection with salmonellae and mycobacteria induce apoptosis of macrophages. Apoptotic blebs are subsequently engulfed by DCs and shuttle to lysosomes where the antigenic cargo is further handled for binding to MHC I or CD1 molecules. This pathway is important for the following reasons: 1) Mycobacteria are firmly secluded from the cytoplasm; that is, the classical MHC I pathway; 2) macrophages lose their antigen presenting capacity quickly after infection; and 3) only DCs express CD1 molecules.
non-classical MHC Ib molecules, which are encoded within the MHC, and by MHC-I-like molecules encoded outside the MHC. In comparison to viral infection models, the vast array of different physicochemical entities that are recognized by T cells in the course of bacterial infections is astonishing and comprises all natural ingredients — fat, protein and carbohydrates. In addition, bacteria-unique peptides are presented during infections, including N-formylated peptides, which are presented by non-classical MHC Ib molecules, and have been studied using experimental listeriosis in mice [1]. More recently, conventional T cells have been reported to recognise methylated epitopes from the tubercle bacillus. Interestingly, a subunit vaccine composed of heparin-binding haemagglutinin expressed vaccine activity against tuberculosis only in the methylated natural form but not in the unmethylated recombinant form [6•]. Although the vital role of T cells in control of intracellular bacteria is well appreciated, the conditions for antigen-specific activation of the different T-cell subtypes in antibacterial protection are just beginning to be elucidated.

### Antigen-presenting cells

Although all nucleated cells can present antigens via MHC I, proper T-cell priming and activation requires professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which also express MHC II, CD1 and co-stimulatory molecules. The predominant APCs are the dendritic cells (DCs). However, activated macrophages and also B-cell blasts are additionally able to induce profound T-cell activation and are critical in maintaining immunity. Similar to macrophages, DCs fulfil antigen presentation and host defence tasks, and at the same time can be misused as habitat for intracellular bacteria. Thus, the role of DCs in infections with intracellular bacteria remains enigmatic. It is now well established that intracellular bacteria persist not only in mononuclear phagocytes but also in DCs. Some studies suggest that DCs primarily support intracellular persistence of bacteria [7–9], and hence are of benefit to the pathogen, whereas other studies provide evidence of higher antimicrobial capacities of DCs in addition to their antigen-presenting functions and to the benefit of the host [7–9]. On the basis of surface marker phenotype, tissue distribution, cytokine production and the capacity to stimulate T cells, distinct DC subpopulations can be distinguished. These subpopulations comprise the myeloid, lymphoid and plasmacytoid DCs, and the Langerhans cells of the epidermis [10]. In mice, differential cross-presentation of exogenous antigens has been demonstrated, and lymphoid CD8+ DCs are more effective in cross-presentation than myeloid CD8− DCs [11]. Recently, a role for the Toll-like receptors (TLRs) in the maturation of DCs and their capacity to stimulate T cells has been described [12]. As TLRs sense microbial products, this finding provides further support for the instructive role of innate immunity in the stimulation of acquired immunity in response to microbial invasion.

### MHC II presentation

MHC-II-restricted CD4+ T cells are necessary for protection against bacterial pathogens [1]. The binding of bacterial peptides to MHC II probably occurs in different compartments inside the APC. All bacterial pathogens pass through the endosomal system at least once in their lifetime independent of their preferred habitat — be it intracellular or extracellular. The antigen repertoire, however, is probably altered by the intracellular niche occupied by the bacterial pathogen and the type of antigen delivery (dead versus live bacteria, antibody-opsonized versus complement-opsonized bacteria, particulate versus soluble antigen).

*L. pneumophila* is a phagosomal pathogen that survives in macrophages because it redirects its phagosome into an ER-derived organelle. The modified phagosome seems to be a safe niche for the survival of the bacterium, and hence is generally considered to be a habitat of double value [13•]: first, it facilitates the replication of *L. pneumophila* in resting macrophages; and, second, it restricts MHC II presentation to CD4+ T cells. By contrast, growth of *L. pneumophila* and antigen presentation is observed in DCs. The legionella dotA system allows the injection of bacteria-derived proteins into the host cell cytoplasm. DotA mutants cannot redirect phagosome maturation and consequently end up in the lysosome. By comparing this mutant with wild-type legionellae residing in ER-derived vacuoles, evidence was obtained that the different intracellular compartments cause distinct antigenic repertoires that generate a superior T-cell response in wild-type *L. pneumophila*-infected mice [13•]. This could be caused by proteins that are synthesized by *L. pneumophila* exclusively during its residence in the ER vacuole and by the provision of unique antigenic peptides, which are probably created by different proteases in the ER vacuole compared to the lysosome.

Recent studies have revealed that zwitterionic polysaccharides can be presented by MHC II molecules to CD4+ T cells [14,15••]. Zwitterionic polysaccharides are the major components of the capsules of several bacteria including *Bacteroides fragilis* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae* type 1. Moreover, T cells have been implicated in abscess formation by such bacteria for a long time. Apparently, the processing of zwitterionic polysaccharides depends on reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates, which degrade these carbohydrate antigens into components of lower molecular weight that then act as T-cell epitopes in the context of MHC II. The elucidation of these mechanisms extends the realm of non-proteinaceous antigen processing from unconventional presentation by MHC-I-like molecules to the conventional MHC II system. Clearly there are similarities between the MHC II carbohydrate presentation pathway and the CD1 lipid presentation pathway, which are both initiated in late endosomal stages (see below).
MHC I presentation

With the exception of listeriae, shigellae and rickettsiae, most bacterial pathogens do not access, or escape into, the cytoplasm of host cells. Nevertheless, most bacterial infections induce MHC-I-restricted CD8⁺ T cells, which frequently participate in host protection. For cytoplasmic bacteria the classical MHC I pathway is probably applicable: protein degradation by proteasomes and other cytoplasmic proteases; transport of peptides into the lumen of the ER by transporter of antigen processing (TAP); peptide trimming by ER- and Golgi-resident proteases; and, chaperone-mediated binding to MHC I molecules [1,16]. However, the way in which antigens from phagosomal bacteria reach the MHC I pathway has only recently been elucidated, and two models for this have been established, and are described below.

Cross presentation

The ER is the compartment in which antigenic peptides are loaded onto MHC I molecules. An elegant ultrastructural study demonstrated ER membranes underneath the phagocytic cup formed during phagocytosis at the particle–phagocyte interface, which are probably a membrane source for the developing phagosome [17]. This model brings the MHC I processing machinery close to the engulfed microorganism [18]. Two follow-up studies then established that components of this machinery, including proteasomes, TAP, heat-shock protein (HSP)-70, calnexin and calreticulin are indeed present at the phagosomal membrane (Figure 2) [19**,20**]. Only when antigens are phagocytosed in the form of particles (e.g. coupled to beads) they activate CD8⁺ T cells. Pinocytosis (i.e. the uptake of soluble materials) fails to activate CD8⁺ T cells. This scenario now provides an explanation for older studies, which revealed that particulate antigens, including bacteria, induce CD8⁺ T cells by cross-presentation.

Cross-priming

Although *S. enterica* remains in the phagosomes within macrophages, they are controlled by both CD8⁺ T cells and CD4⁺ T cells. This is also true for *M. tuberculosis* — perhaps with an even higher contribution to control by the CD8⁺ T cells. Elegant work has now shown that stimulation of antigen-specific CD8⁺ T cells is provided by cross-priming. In both infections, the infection-mediated apoptosis of host cells thus represents an essential prerequisite for CD8⁺ T-cell stimulation [21,22*]. *M. tuberculosis*, although firmly secluded from the cytoplasm, induces apoptosis in macrophages, leading to the release of apoptotic blebs

Saposins act as chaperones that facilitate contact between lipid antigens and CD1 molecules. (a) Because of their high hydrophilic nature, glycolipid antigens are readily integrated into membranes and thus are not accessible for loading onto CD1 molecules. (b) In lysosomes, bacterial lipids are present within intralysosomal membranes consisting of endogenous lipids prone for degradation and recycling. (c) Saposins, by virtue of their capacity to disintegrate these membranes make endogenous as well as exogenous lipids accessible for lysosomal proteins, such as enzymes, but also, as described here, for CD1 molecules. (d) Through interaction with CD1 molecules, saposins perform chaperone-like functions, thus allowing CD1 loading with glycolipid antigens. Saposins and CD1 appear to interact directly on a molecular level to bridge the hydrophilic gap between the hydrophobic intralysosomal membranes and the hydrophilic antigen binding groove of the CD1 molecules. SAP, saposin.
(Figure 2). These blebs traffic to non-infected DCs, where they end up in lysosomes. Consequently, the processing of bleb-derived antigens primarily depends on lysosomal activities [22]. This alternative detour pathway targets bacterial antigens to DCs for the induction of CD8⁺ T cells both in salmonellosis and in tuberculosis. Cross-priming is also a vital scenario for other intracellular bacteria, especially those dwelling in non-phagocytic host cells, such as chlamydiae.

It should be emphasized that both models (cross presentation and cross-priming) are not mutually exclusive but rather complementary, as apoptosis is induced by certain bacterial pathogens but blocked by others. In both scenarios, however, chaperone-mediated peptide trafficking into the cytoplasm, as detailed for HSP70 and its receptor CD91, are involved [16]. Interestingly, this cytoplasmic transport seems to be exclusive for DCs and absent in macrophages [23].

### CD1 molecules present lipophilic antigens

In humans, CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells expressing a conventional αβ T-cell receptor (TCR) exist that recognize glycolipids in the context of the group I CD1 molecules (CD1a, CD1b and CD1c) [24]. The CD1c molecule also controls a subset of γδ T cells and is therefore the only antigen-presenting molecule known so far for such T cells (see below). Group I CD1 and lipid-specific T cells are primarily of the inflammatory phenotype and thus express IFN-γ and have cytolytic activity. The group II CD1 molecule CD1d controls NKT cells, which express an evolutionary conserved TCR (Vα14Jα281 in mice, Vα24JαQ in humans; combined with a skewed TCR Vβ chain repertoire). These NKT cells express both IFN-γ and IL-4, and have cytolytic activity, thereby linking innate with adaptive immunity [24].

#### The world of lipids as presented by CD1 molecules

The number of known lipid antigens presented by group I CD1 molecules has increased in the past couple of years, and most of them are of either mammalian or mycobacterial origin. This suggests that these molecules are specialized to bind to and present lipids specific for mycobacteria, thereby playing a particular role in immunity to tuberculosis and leprosy, which are characterized by persistent infection and disease. The mycobacterial lipids mannosylated lipoarabinomannan (LAM), lipomannan, free mycolic acids, glucose monomycolate (GMM) and phosphatidyl-myo-inositol mannosides (PIMs), as well as the capsular lipopolysaccharide of *H. influenzae*, are ligands for CD1b. Mycobacterial diacylated sulfoglycolipids (SGL), such as Ac₂SGL with two palmitic acid chains, have recently been added to this list [25]. CD1c presents mannophosphoisoprenoids of bacterial origin to T cells [26], and identified microbial ligands for CD1a belong to a class of mycobacterial lipopeptides — the dihydroxymycobactins [27]. The α galactosyl ceramide (α GalCer), a sponge lipid of unknown physiological relevance, binds CD1d and is a strong agonist for Vα14 NKT cells. Bacterial ligands, however, were not described until recently, when mycobacterial PIM was revealed as a natural ligand for CD1d, which activates human and murine NKT cells [28]. Future studies will probably reveal additional bacterial ligands for CD1 molecules.

#### The structures of CD1 molecules

Of the group I CD1 family, CD1a presents lipid antigen in a promiscuous manner, whereas CD1c cognates bind lipids with a single fatty acid chain, and CD1b and CD1d accommodate ligands with two acyl chains. Crystal structure analyses of CD1 molecules suggest that fatty acid chains of amphipathic lipids bind to the hydrophobic antigen-binding groove between the α1 and α2 domains, and the TCR recognizes the hydrophilic head group. Whereas CD1a and CD1d have two hydrophobic pockets to bind two acyl chains, in CD1b a series of four hydrophobic channels can accommodate long fatty acids as they exist in mycolates [29–32].

#### Processing of lipid antigens

CD1a is a residential protein of early/recycling endosomes and recycling involves the GTPase ARF6. Langerhans cells require CD1a and langerin, a C-type lectin located within the Birbeck granules, for capturing and engulfment of antigen [33]. Lipids presented by CD1b, CD1c and CD1d depend on trafficking of the CD1 molecules to late endosomes/lysosomes for presentation, which is facilitated by an endosomal sorting sequence (YXXΦ; Y, tyrosine; X, any amino acid; Φ, bulky hydrophobic residue) within the cytoplasmic tail. This sequence allows the binding of CD1b to the adaptor protein (AP)-3 for delivery to lysosomes. Whereas CD1c and CD1d do not bind AP-3, recycling of CD1b and CD1c from the plasma membrane depends on AP-2 [24]. Thereby, CD1 molecules can scavenge lipids from distinct intracellular compartments. Mycobacterial lipid antigens are released from bacteria and transported to lysosomes [34,35]. The low pH milieu and reducing conditions in lysosomes favour lipid binding to CD1 molecules. Lipid antigens can be processed by lysosomal enzymes such as lysosomal phospholipase A, which determines antigen binding to CD1d and subsequent recognition by NKT cells [28,36].

Recent studies revealed that lysosomal lipid transfer proteins (LTPs), such as saposins or ganglioside activator proteins, are required to bridge the lipid-water interface and efficiently load lipids into the CD1 antigen-binding groove in a hydrophilic milieu. Saposin C, which performs essential functions during degradation and metabolism of mammalian sphingolipids is, at the same time, critical for the presentation of LAM, GMM and mycolic acid through CD1b (Figure 2). The functional activities of
saposin C involve extraction of mycobacterial lipids from membranes and direct interaction with CD1b [37**]. Saposins and the endosomal G<sub>M2</sub> activator protein are involved in the loading of lipids onto CD1d [38**,39**]. In an elegant study, Zhou et al. [38**] showed that saposin-deficient mice lack Va14 NKT cells, suggesting that saposins promote the loading of self-lipids to CD1d. By contrast, Kang and Cresswell [39**] reported that lack of saposins only affects the recognition of exogenous, but not of endogenous, lipids by NKT cells. In the ER another LTP, the microsomal triglyceride transfer protein, obviously has a complementary function to that of saposins in lysosomes, ligand binding to CD1d. These LTPs load self-lipids or αGalCer onto CD1d, but their role in CD1d-presentation of bacterial lipids, such as PIM remain unknown.

A different hypothesis suggests that IL-12 produced by DCs, triggered by bacterial products such as LPS (probably via TLRs), indirectly activates self-reactive NKT cells, which then respond more vigorously to self-lipids presented by CD1d [40]. Note that due to the DC-restricted expression of CD1 molecules, the detour pathway, as outlined above, is critical for lipid presentation by CD1 molecules. Apoptotic blebs from infected macrophages that are devoid of surface-expressed group I CD1 molecules shuttle lipid antigens to DCs in the vicinity [22*]. Bacterial lipid antigens can probably activate innate immunity (through TLRs) and acquired immunity (through CD1) at the same time, thereby boosting inflammatory immune responses [1].

### γδ T cells

The role of γδ T cells in bacterial infections remains enigmatic. The recent finding that γδ T cells participate in protection against tuberculosis in non-human primates has emphasized their role in host defence against bacterial infections; however, this has yet to be demonstrated in humans [41]. The original evidence for a role of γδ T cells in bacterial infections stems from the finding that human γδ T cells recognize mycobacterial phospholigands (for further references, see [42]). More recent studies have elucidated the mechanisms underlying the production of microbial phospholigands [42]. The responsible isoprenoid biosynthesis pathway is not restricted to mycobacteria but exists in a large variety of microorganisms independent of their pathogenicity comprising obligate pathogens, commensal and environmental bacteria. It is likely that the phospholigands for γδ T cells are generated in the phagosome, the common habitat of most intracellular bacteria. Surprisingly, however, chloroquine treatment, which affects MHC II processing for presentation to CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, increases γδ T-cell stimulation. It is thought that inhibition of membrane trafficking by chloroquine increases processing and transport of phospholigands to the cell surface [43].

Phospholigands are recognized by Vγ9Vδ2 (Vγ2Vδ2 in the American nomenclature) T cells. Thus far, it remains unclear whether the γδ T cells expressing Vδ1 also participate in antibacterial immunity. The Vδ1-expressing T cells are known to recognize non-polymorphic MHC-like molecules, notably CD1c. During bacterial infections, DCs expressing CD1c are stimulated to express co-stimulatory molecules and IL-12. Rather than being activated by bacterial antigens, CD1c-reactive γδT cells are stimulated through this pathway [44]. Co-stimulation seems to be sufficient to stimulate these self-reactive γδ T cells. Thus, γδ T cells and NKT cells can apparently be stimulated by similar measures during bacterial infections independent of bacterial antigens (see above).

#### The undermining of antigen presentation by pathogenic bacteria

The phagocytosis of particles is a potent stimulus for antigen presentation. The mycobacterial phagosome contains the MHC II molecule HLA-H2-DM and it is capable of degrading antigens [45]. The increased activity of particle-containing phagosomes can be, at least partially, explained by an enhanced acquisition of MHC II molecules by this compartment. However, the arrest of phagosome maturation, as elicited by various intracellular bacteria, also impairs MHC II processing. Consequently, replication in phagosomes and impaired MHC II processing frequently seem to go hand in hand.

#### Mycobacteria interfere with antigen-presenting cell functions

The extent to which the intracellular survival strategies of bacteria affect antigen processing, and thus T-cell stimulation, is just beginning to be uncovered. Because of the enormous medical relevance and the persistent lifestyle of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, this microorganism has generated particular attention. *M. tuberculosis* and, to a lesser degree, the vaccine strain *Mycobacterium bovis* bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG), arrest phagosome maturation at an early stage [1]. Many mechanisms for this have been suggested, and neutralization of the phagosomal pH by ammonia was one of the first to be described. Ammonia production is catalyzed by urease, and mycobacteria deficient in urease fail to produce ammonia and hence to neutralize the acidic pH of the phagosome. This mechanism not only promotes mycobacterial survival in the phagosome but also impacts on the stimulation of acquired immune responses by inhibiting MHC II surface expression [46*]. Although not proven, it is conceivable that this mechanism impairs the stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup>T lymphocytes in tuberculosis and other mycobacterial diseases.

A 19 kDa lipoprotein (Rv3763) from *M. tuberculosis* has been found to impair MHC II processing. More recent studies provide evidence that lipoproteins impair IFN-γ
stimulation independently from the signalling molecule SOCS1 (suppressor of cytokine signalling) and Stat1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription) [47*,48,49]. The 19 kDa lipoprotein, however, inhibits IFN-γ-induced class II transactivator and interferon regulatory factor-1 signalling as well as MHC II expression. Although the underlying mechanisms are far from fully understood, these examples illustrate the marked impact of viable bacteria and their products on antigen processing. More recently, another gene product (Rv1411c) has also been found to impair MHC II processing [50].

### Anthrax toxins impair antigen presentation

Bioterrorist attacks in 2001 have re-emphasized the lethal threat of *Bacillus anthracis* and subsequently stimulated profound financial commitment from granting bodies, notably in the US, for research into this pathogen. This has increased interest in the mechanisms underlying the lethality of anthrax. *B. anthracis* produces three factors of major interest: lethal factor, which exerts its highly toxic activity by impairing the mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling pathways; edema factor, which causes edema; and protective antigen, which promotes entry of the two toxic factors (lethal factor and edema factor) into host cells [51]. Lethal toxin (i.e. protective antigen plus lethal factor) not only exerts general toxicity but specifically affects antigen-specific T-cell stimulation by DCs [52*]. Thus, anthrax not only poses a direct lethal threat but also interferes with antigen presentation, and thus can affect immune responses to unrelated pathogens.

### The search for new bacterial factors influencing antigen presentation

As antigen presentation is a critical bottle-neck for acquired immune defence it provides a natural target of microbial survival strategies in the host. Antibody-mediated defence depends on antigen recognition without previous processing. Hence, the evasion of antibody responses by antigenic variation is an efficacious and widely used stealth strategy. By contrast, antigen processing as a prerequisite of antigen recognition by T lymphocytes offers additional evasion strategies for intracellular microbes. Although several strategies and molecules capable of affecting antigen processing have been identified in viral infection systems, less is known about similar bacterial strategies [53]. Given that the genome of bacteria vastly exceeds that of viruses, it would be surprising if bacteria have not developed equally sophisticated mechanisms to manipulate antigen processing.

Using a global transposon mutagenesis approach, Qimron et al. [54*] have screened more than 3000 mutants for altered peptide presentation by infected macrophages. This approach resulted in the identification of a candidate gene capable of manipulating MHC I presentation.

Mutants in the *yej* operon (the *yej* operon is putatively involved in peptide transport, although its exact function is unknown) induce superior MHC I presentation, leading to elevated CD8⁺ T-cell responses. Consistent with a role of the *yej* operon in the manipulation of MHC I processing, *yej* knockout mutants were better vaccine carriers for heterologous antigens in a tumour model *in vivo* [54].

### Concluding remarks and outlook

As our knowledge about the multifaceted cross-talk between microbes and the antigen processing and presentation machinery increases, we can harness this knowledge for rational vaccine design. The creation of an improved recombinant (r)BCG vaccine strain against tuberculosis is an instructive example (L Gröde *et al.*, unpublished). The identification of listeriolysin (Hly) as an essential and sufficient molecule for egression of *L. monocytogenes* from the phagosome into the cytosol led to the construction of an rBCG strain expressing Hly. It was reasoned that this strain improves the stimulation of MHC-I-restricted CD8⁺ T cells and, in this way, increases protective efficacy of the new vaccine strain; indeed, this was the case (L Gröde *et al.*, unpublished). Hly is optimal at an acidic pH, however, and the knowledge that BCG neutralizes the phagosomal pH by means of urease led to the construction of a second-generation vaccine, rBCG expressing Hly but with urease removed (see above). This strain allowed phagosome acidification and, therefore, generation of an optimum pH for Hly. As a consequence, this improved rBCG strain possessed superior vaccine efficacy not only in comparison to wild-type BCG but also in comparison to rBCG expressing Hly. It was originally thought that this improvement was due to translocation of mycobacterial antigens to the cytosol, promoting MHC I processing and ultimately CD8⁺ T-cell stimulation. The finding that CD8⁺ T-cell stimulation in tuberculosis is primarily mediated through cross presentation (see above) stimulated additional experiments. Indeed, it could be confirmed that rBCG expressing Hly in the absence of urease induced apoptosis of infected cells, probably through perforation of the phagosomal membrane, resulting in the release of cathepsins into the cytosol, which then induce apoptosis. Thus, elucidation of the mechanisms underlying antigen presentation in microbial infections is not only of academic interest but also provides guidelines for novel intervention strategies against infectious diseases.
