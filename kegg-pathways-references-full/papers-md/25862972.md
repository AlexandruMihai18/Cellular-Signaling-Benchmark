### ABSTRACT

Apoptosis is a type of programmed cell death that produces changes in cell morphology and in biochemical intracellular processes without inflammatory reactions. The components of the apoptotic pathways are conserved throughout evolution. Caspases are key molecules involved in the transduction of the death signal and are responsible for many of the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis. Nowadays, it is known that caspases are activated through two major apoptotic pathways (the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway), but there are also evidences of at least other alternative pathway (the perforin/granzyme pathway). Apoptosis in mollusks seems to be similar in complexity to apoptosis in vertebrates but also has unique features maybe related to their recurrent exposure to environmental changes, pollutants, pathogens and also related to the sedentary nature of some stages in the life cycle of mollusks bivalves and gastropods. As in other animals, apoptotic process is involved in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis and also constitutes an important immune response that can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, hormones, toxic insults, viruses, and protozoan parasites. The main goal of this work is to present the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in mollusks and to highlight those steps that need further study.

### 1. Introduction

Apoptosis, a type of programmed cell death process, is widely distributed in nature, including plants, fungi, single cell eukaryotes and animals [49,104,115,117,130]. This process occurs during development and aging, playing a homeostatic role in both vertebrates and invertebrates. Apoptosis is also involved in immune reactions and in responses to cell damage caused by diseases or toxic agents [25,90].

Apoptotic cell death was classically investigated in vertebrates and model invertebrates such as *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster* [10,69,122], led to initial views suggesting that a simple ancestral apoptotic network in invertebrates was further expanded in vertebrates. Currently, the analysis of genomic information from invertebrates, including cnidarians, echinoderms, mollusks and amphioxus [54,62,96,106,119,127,152], suggests that this apoptotic network already existed in the ancestor of the entire animal kingdom (Metazoa) in a form more complex than expected [34,118,130]. The evolution of the apoptotic pathway does not seem to be a linear process of complexity increase but is inherently dynamic, including lineage-specific gene losses and expansions and the emergence/reemergence of similar proteins [151]. In this context, the apparent simplicity of apoptosis in nematodes and insects might not be the ancestral state but, most likely, a result of more recent simplifications [152]. High complexity levels have been described in the apoptotic network of Mollusca, in which certain key components (p53, Bcl-2 family proteins, BI-1 and PDRD proteins) are more related to those of vertebrates and others (initiator caspases and Dff-A protein) are more related to invertebrate components [28,54,109,119,147]. The complexity of the apoptotic pathway in mollusks is intermediate between that of ecdysozoa and deuterostomes [92,147] (Fig. 1).

The initial definition of apoptosis proposed by Kerr et al. [52] was based on changes in cell morphology. Dying cells exhibit cytoplasmic shrinkage, active membrane blebbing, chromatin condensation, and, typically, fragmentation into membrane-enclosed vesicles called apoptotic bodies [42] (Fig. 2). These morphological alterations are accompanied by various biochemical changes at the intracellular level, such as the degradation of chromosomal DNA into high-molecular-weight and oligonucleosomal fragments [91,140] and the cleavage and activation of a specialized family of cysteine-dependent aspartate-directed proteases

(caspases) [13,24]. At the cell surface, the externalization of phosphatidylserine [75] and other alterations promote the recognition and elimination of apoptotic bodies by phagocytes [100,112]. Essentially, there is no inflammatory reaction associated with the process of apoptosis or with the removal of apoptotic cells because apoptotic cells do not release their cellular constituents into the surrounding interstitial tissue, and the apoptotic bodies are rapidly engulfed by surrounding cells without the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines [59,113]. All these characteristic morphological hallmarks of apoptosis have been well described in a variety of mollusks, mainly in bivalves [120,123,1,109] but also in gastropods [8,80,111] and cephalopods [55,56].

The main goal of this work is to present the current knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of apoptosis in mollusks and to highlight those steps that need further study. Much of the information presented here is derived from bivalves although information from gastropods and cephalopods is also included.

## 2. The apoptotic machinery

As Elmore [25] stated, “the mechanisms of apoptosis are highly complex and sophisticated, involving an energy-dependent cascade of molecular events”. Key components of the apoptotic pathways remain remarkably conserved throughout evolution, although several differences between lower animals and vertebrates have been described [77,130]. Currently, it is clear that there are two major apoptotic pathways in mollusks: the extrinsic or death receptor pathway and the intrinsic or mitochondrial pathway [28,54,119,127,147]. In vertebrates, there is an additional pathway, the perforin/granzyme pathway, which involves T-cell mediated cytotoxicity and perforin-granzyme-dependent apoptotic killing of the cell [131]. The description of perforins in several bivalve mollusks [27,74,119] and the study of transplant rejection in terrestrial mollusks [35,36] suggest that this third pathway might also be functional in mollusks. Although all pathways can function independently, important interactions among them serve to amplify the apoptotic signal [30]. All the apoptotic pathways converge on an executory step that is initiated by the cleavage of caspase-3 and results in the cell death.

### 2.1. Caspases

Caspases are the key components of intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways. In mammals, caspases have proteolytic activity and are able to cleave proteins at aspartic acid residues, although different caspases have different specificities involving recognition of neighboring amino acids [18,24]. Caspases are categorized as initiators (caspase-2,-8,-9,-10), effectors or executioners (caspase-3,-6,-7) and inflammatory caspases (caspase-1,-4,-5) [105]. Initiator caspases mediate signal transduction and caspase activation by oligomerization. Once activated, they cleave and activate the executioner caspases that act upon cytoskeleton proteins, mitochondria, nuclear membrane or chromatin [4,18,46]. Caspases are involved in the transduction of the death signal and are responsible for many of the biochemical and morphological changes associated with apoptosis [43]. The executioner caspase-3 activates a heterodimeric protein, DNA fragmentation factor (DFF), which is responsible for the completion of DNA fragmentation [138]. Apoptotic fragmented DNA shows a laddering pattern when visualized in an agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide after separation by gel electrophoresis [16]. Caspases can also play important non-apoptotic roles, as found during development, cellular proliferation and differentiation in mammals and flies [114,126,132].

Initiator caspases have been identified in several mollusk species. The initiator caspase-2 has been described in the Mediterranean mussel, *Mytilus galloprovincialis* [109] and in *Crassostrea gigas* [147,148]. In *M. galloprovincialis*, this caspase lacks the conserved cysteine active site pentapeptide and the typical p20 domain, suggesting a regulatory function for this truncated form of caspase-2, similar to other truncated forms of caspase-2 described in humans [149]. Other initiator caspases such as caspase-8 have been identified in *M. galloprovincialis* [109], California mussel, *Mytilus californianus* (GenBank accession number ADB80147) and Hong Kong oyster, *Crassostrea hongkongensis* [141] and in a gastropod, the disk abalone (*Haliotis discus discus*) [47,63]. Expressed sequence tags (ESTs) with homology to caspase-8 have also been reported in the carpet shell clam (*Ruditapes decussatus*) [82] and the king scallop (*Pecten maximus*) [95] after *Vibrio* challenges. Molluscan caspase-8 showed a low identity with other invertebrate and vertebrate caspase-8s [63,109,141]. At the structural level, the typical mammalian caspase-8 domains (P20 and P10 subunits), and cysteine active sites were identified in most molluscan caspase-8s [47,63,109]. However, the two N-terminal DEDs essential for recruitment and activation in mammalian caspase-8 were identified in the disk abalone (*H. discus discus*) [63] but lacking in the colored abalone (*Haliotis diversicolor*) [47] and also in *M. galloprovincialis* [109]. The low identity values of caspase-8 sequence between Molluscan and other invertebrates and the differences observed at structural level in different Molluscan species suggest a specific evolution of this protein in this phylum.

Executioner caspases in mollusks show remarkable structural and functional adaptations. Two and four executioner caspases were characterized in *C. gigas* and *M. galloprovincialis*, respectively [109,147], highlighting the importance of the executor phase in the apoptotic process of mollusks. Caspase-3 activity has been reported in mussel mantle tissues exposed to a short acute stress [51] and in oyster hemocytes exposed to cadmium or noradrenaline [61,120]. In gastropods, caspase-3 activity has also been described in *Helix*’s salivary gland and during neuronogenesis [6,98].

General caspase inhibitors such as Z-VAD-FMK have been used to analyze the activity of caspases in the molluscan apoptotic pathway, with contradictory results. Although an inhibition of noradrenaline-induced apoptosis was described in Pacific oyster (*C. gigas*) hemocytes [61], no effect was observed in UV-induced apoptosis in mussel hemocytes [28], suggesting that different genotoxic stresses can trigger diverse apoptotic molecular mechanisms, even in phylogenetically close species such as bivalves.

#### 2.2. Caspase activation: the extrinsic pathway

In vertebrates, the extrinsic signaling pathway involves transmembrane receptor-mediated interactions. Extracellular ligands are recognized by death domain-containing transmembrane receptors (TNF receptor gene superfamily), resulting in the direct activation of the caspase cascade and/or induction of the mitochondrial permeability transition [7]. The death domain plays a critical role in transmitting the death signal from the cell surface to the intracellular signaling pathways. To date, the best-characterized ligands and corresponding death receptors include FasL/FasR, TNF-$\alpha$/TNFR1, Apo3L/DR3, Apo2L/DR4 and Apo2L/DR5 [25]. Adapter proteins such as TRADD, FADD and RIP associate with procaspase-8, resulting in the auto-catalytic activation of initiator caspases and triggering the executioner phase of apoptosis [4,53].

In mollusks, a gene homologous to human TNF-$\alpha$ was described in disk abalone [21] and in the flat oyster (*Ostrea edulis*) [76], and members of the TNFR family have been identified in *Chlamys farreri* [67] and *Mytilus edulis* [97]. Other ligands related to the apoptotic process, such as the TRAIL (Apo2-ligand) and the FasL ligand, have

been identified in Crassostrea ariakensis, C. gigas, O. edulis and H. discus discus [22,84,143,147,148]. Transmembrane receptors, such as TRAF and TTRAP proteins, were described in C. farreri [102,142], and adaptor proteins similar to human FADD were identified in C. gigas [147,148] (Fig. 1). Lipopolysaccharide-induced TNF-α factor (LITAF) is one of the most important transcription factors mediating TNF-α transcription. This gene has been identified in several species of bivalve mollusks such as C. farreri, Pinctada fucata, C. gigas, Mizuhopecten yessoensis, Meretrix meretrix and M. edulis [45,66,94,97,144,145].

NF-κB transcription factors are involved in the extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway in mollusks [127], and most of the key components of the NF-κB signaling pathway have been described in mollusks, although their precise role was not described [81,93,150]. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway in mollusks can also be triggered by the activation of surface receptors for hormones and integrins [127]. Integrins have been identified in C. gigas and the freshwater snail Biomphalaria glabrata at the gene and/or protein levels [20,129]. It has also been found that hemocytes from the Pacific oyster (C. gigas) undergo apoptosis following cell adhesion mediated by integrin-like molecules [128] by direct caspase-3 activation [9].

2.3. Caspase activation: the intrinsic mitochondrial pathway

In mollusks, the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway has been extensively analyzed in mussels and oysters [28,147]. The intrinsic signaling pathway is induced by a diverse set of non-receptor-mediated stimuli that produce the release of pro-apoptotic proteins from the mitochondria to the cytosol [2]. The absence of certain growth factors, hormones and cytokines and various stimuli, such as reactive oxygen species/reactive nitrogen species (ROS/RNS), mitochondrial DNA damage, stress in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), UV radiations, viral infections, genotoxics or

Please cite this article in press as: A. Romero, et al., The complexity of apoptotic cell death in mollusks: An update, Fish & Shellfish Immunology (2015), http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2015.03.038

environmental pollutants can initiate this pathway [14,28,33,50,109,137].

All of these stimuli can induce the permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOMP), the formation of a mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPT) and the release from the intermembrane space into the cytosol of pro-apoptotic proteins such as cytochrome c (cyt c), apoptosis inducing factor (AIF) or second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases/direct IAP binding protein with low pI (Smac/Diablo) [78,124]. However, it is not clear whether MOMP is absolutely required to induce apoptosis in bivalves. Estévez-Calvar et al. [28] studied the involvement of the MOMP in the apoptosis induced by UV light in mussel hemocytes using a treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), which blocks mitochondrial permeability transition pores and thereby inhibits apoptosis [135]. In mussel hemocytes, CsA treatment did not exert any substantial effect on UV light-induced apoptosis, suggesting that MOMP is not required for the liberation of proapoptotic factors into the cytosol as previously proposed for other invertebrate models [92,120,130].

Cyt c is considered the hallmark of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway in vertebrates and invertebrates. Within the cytosol, this molecule triggers caspase-dependent or caspase-independent signaling events [3,71]. Cyt c binds to the apoptotic protease-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) through a WD40 domain and forms the apoptosome to which procaspase-9 is recruited [65]. The ATP-dependent cleavage of procaspase-9 signals the downstream cleavage/activation of effector caspases, -3 and -6/7 [40,65,70]. Notably, apaf-1 and caspase-9 genes have not been formally described in bivalves, and only ESTs have been annotated in oysters (*C. gigas*) and Manila clams (*Ruditapes philippinarum*) [82,147].

Several sequences of mitochondrial factors released during the MOMP, such as SMAC/Diablo, and several AIF proteins have been described in oysters and mussels (*C. gigas*, *M. galloprovincialis* and *M. edulis*) [11,97,119,147]. Moreover, several ESTs of an APAF-1 interacting protein (APIP) have been identified in the clams *R. decussatus* and *R. philippinarum* [82] (Fig. 1).

The control and regulation of these apoptotic mitochondrial events occurs through members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins and the regulatory protein Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) [17,108]. The Bcl-2 family is composed of more than 30 proteins that belong to the Bcl-2 superfamily, namely, anti-apoptotic proteins, pro-apoptotic proteins and BH3-only proteins [46,137]. Thus, the apoptotic susceptibility of a cell is a function of the balance in the actions of anti- and pro-apoptotic proteins. Normally, the anti-apoptotic proteins, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, interact with pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins such as Bax/Bak or with the BH3-only proteins to prevent apoptogenic factor release. However, activation of cytosolic BH3-only proteins promotes Bax/Bak protein conformational change and

protein oligomerization, which induces large pore formation in the outer mitochondrial membrane [26,89]. Different members of the Bcl-2 family (Bcl-xL, Bcl-xS, Bag, Bcl2 and Bax) have been described in the bivalve mollusks *C. gigas* and *M. galloprovincialis* [11,28,147,148] (Fig. 1). Additionally, the regulatory protein Bax inhibitor-1 (BI-1) has been described in a mussel [28]. In vertebrates, the Bid gene, a BH3-only protein, associates the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and indirectly activates executioner caspases [116]. Interestingly, also high-throughput sequencing technologies have not detected homologs of the BH3-only proteins in bivalves, to date [82,97,147], suggesting that alternative associations between intrinsic and extrinsic pathways could exist in bivalves.

The tumor suppressor protein p53 also has a critical role in regulation of the Bcl-2 family [25]. This gene has been described in different mollusk species [134,28]; and presents structural features similar to those previously described in humans [44,121]. The mitochondrial pathway of p53-dependent apoptosis activation was demonstrated to be functional in mollusks [54]. The p53 gene is considered a major mediator of the UV-induced stress response [58]. The implications of the p53 gene for the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway were analyzed in mussel hemocytes after UV irradiation [28] using PFT-a, a chemical compound that selectively blocks the potential transactivation of p53 and p53 downstream genes in a variety of cell types [68]. This gene is highly expressed in mussel hemocytes and could act as a transcription factor after translocation to the nucleus to regulate the expression of downstream target genes such as PDRP [72]. The PFT-a treatment in mussel hemocytes reduced apoptotic levels over short time periods after UV exposure; however, no inhibitory effect was observed at 24 h, suggesting that transcriptional mechanisms are more significant at short times, whereas non-transcriptional mechanisms are relevant at long times [28].

The inhibitors of apoptosis (IAP) proteins regulate apoptotic cell death through the interaction with caspases [23,50]. An IAP gene has been described in the gastropod *Aplysia californica* [85] and in the bivalve *O. edulis* [84]. Additionally, several ESTs were found in the clam *R. philippinarum* [83]. IAP proteins contain baculoviral IAP Repeat (BIR) domains [139]. In the oyster *C. gigas*, a high number of proteins with the BIR domain were detected [146–148]. The expansion of BIR domains may illustrate a complex regulatory mechanism in the apoptotic process of bivalve mollusks. The evolutionary lineage of BIRs and caspase domains will represent an interesting area for further studies when more genomic sequence information is available.

Other important genes related to apoptotic mechanisms independent of caspases have been described in bivalves. For instance, several ESTs with homology to cathepsins were identified in

R. philippinarum and O. edulis [83,84]. The heat shock 70 protein family (Hsp70) has been extensively studied in bivalves [29]. A member of this family, called mortalin, is able to sequester cytoplasmic p53, preventing its translocation to the nucleus and inhibiting the expression of p53-dependent pro-apoptotic genes, thus decreasing the apoptotic levels in hemocytes from R. philippinarum as described in other invertebrates [5].

Lacoste et al. [61] reported that the protein-kinase A (PKA) was also implicated in the inhibition of apoptosis in mollusks. The Rho proteins are involved in the regulation of cell growth and apoptosis. Those small GTPases of the Ras family (Rho proteins) are involved in the activation of the MAP kinase cascade [60]. Although rho genes were first identified in A. californica [73], data are lacking concerning Rho signaling in mollusk bivalves. Moreira et al. [83] detected the presence of an EST with homology to PKC in R. philippinarum.

### 3. Physiological role of apoptosis in mollusks

#### 3.1. Maintenance of tissue homeostasis

As in all organisms, apoptosis in mollusks is involved in several biological processes and is essential throughout their life cycle in processes such as larval development and the maintenance of adult tissue homeostasis [38,54,79,119]. Qu et al. [103] studied the distribution of Cgcaspase-3 and Cgcaspase-1 in C. gigas in the developmental stages from D-shaped larvae, umbo larvae, and pediveliger larvae to settlement and metamorphosis. This indicates that cytoplasmic substrates cleaved by effector caspases at the settlement and metamorphosis stage occurred at an earlier time point than nuclear substrates. Apoptotic death has been observed during the development of the squid Euprymna scolopes, triggered by the luminous symbiotic bacterium Vibrio fischeri. The association of the bacterium with the squid triggers extensive apoptosis of the epithelium [32] and triggers the morphogenesis of the light organ [56]. It appears that the morphogenesis may be mediated by a p53 family member [41]. In gastropods, apoptosis is also involved in early neuronal development [19].

The involvement of the apoptotic process in the maintenance of tissue homeostasis, physiology and functionality of each organ in mollusks is well reflected by the analysis of the expression of certain apoptotic genes in different tissues [47,86,109]. In the mussel (M. galloprovincialis) [109], the apoptotic process in the different anatomical parts of the digestive gland appears to be quite important because it is the first entrance for potential pathogens such as the copepod Mytilicolaintestinalis [31,133]. Apoptosis could be related not only to the elimination of damaged cells to maintain the structural integrity of the digestive epithelium but also to the physiological activity of mussel digestive cells. The gills are also exposed to environmental conditions and pollutants and are also affected by parasites [31,133], which cause disorganization of the gill filaments such as the turbellarian Urastoma cyprinae [107], reducing the feeding capacity of the bivalves. The high level of expression of caspase genes reported in the gills suggests that caspases are most likely involved in immune or metabolic processes in oyster and mussels [103,109] because gills are a respiratory organ involved in material and energy exchange, where biotic and abiotic stresses are more severe than other tissues. Apoptosis has also been described in hemocytes [119,127], which is not surprising given that the hemocytes are the immune cells in bivalves and apoptosis has been described as a host defense mechanism against parasites, viral and bacterial pathogens [57,127]. Apoptosis enables the adequate clearance of damaged, senescent and infected cells without inflammation [8,120,123]. Motta et al. [86] analyzed the localization and possible function of the caspase-3 gene in various molluscan tissues. These authors found that caspase-3 is present in gut, gill lamellae and digestive gland during digestion but not in heart tissue or in resting digestive glands. The enzyme is also present in gonads of both sexes although, interestingly, significant differences between male and female germ cells were observed. Caspase-3 appears to be associated with degenerative processes in gut, digestive gland and early stage germ cells, while in gills, oocytes and mature spermatozoa it is primarily correlated with cell function and/or differentiation.

Saliva release is another well-studied area of molluscan apoptosis [54,98,99]. In several gastropod species, the cystic cells present in the salivary glands release saliva or mucus droplets through an apoptotic process called cell demolition [87].

#### 3.2. Influence of environmental pollutants on apoptosis

Apoptosis is also involved in adaptive responses to environmental stress [64] and may have facilitated the ecological success of mollusks. Many mollusks are highly influenced by their surrounding environment and are therefore used as bioindicators in ecotoxicological studies [153]. The sessile and filter-feeding behavior of bivalve mollusks facilitates the accumulation of toxic substances such as heavy metals, polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and pesticides, which have been reported to have immunosuppressive effects in bivalves [15,37,88,120]. High concentrations of PHAs, phenanthrene and PCBs, as well as UV radiation, induce apoptotic cell death in hemocytes in the Mediterranean mussel M. galloprovincialis [109]. Treatment with benzopyrene induced a downregulation of all caspase genes, reflecting an immunosuppressor effect; treatments with phenanthrene and PCBs appeared to induce the apoptotic process through the up-regulation of all caspase genes [109].

Environmental toxicants such as heavy metals trigger the intrinsic apoptotic pathway. For example, Cd2+ induced apoptosis in the gill cells of M. edulis [101] and also in oyster hemocytes in a dose-dependent manner through a mitochondria/caspase-independent pathway [120]. A sublethal dose of Cd also induced apoptosis in the cells of the hepatopancreas of the pulmonate snail Helix pomatia, suggesting that apoptosis is the principal mode of elimination of damaged cells from the hepatopancreas of the snail [12].

Apoptosis has also been described in hemocytes of the gastropod Lymnaea stagnalis in response to environmental pollutants such as herbicides, insecticides and pharmaceuticals [111]. In this animal, apoptosis is mediated by lectins and by the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS).

#### 3.3. Apoptosis and diseases

Apoptosis in mollusks constitutes an important immune response that can be triggered by a variety of stimuli, including cytokines, hormones, toxic insults, and parasites or pathogens [119,127]. However, certain pathogens can inhibit this response and prevent host cell death [119].

Bacterial infections can trigger apoptosis by modulating caspase expression. In those infections apoptosis serves to eliminate the intracellular/internalized pathogens. In bivalves, the stimulation of the Mediterranean mussel with Pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [109] or the infection with several species of Vibrio in the Pacific oyster [103,147], in the carpet shell clam (R. decussatus) [82] and in the king scallop (P. maximus) [95] induced the expression of initiator and executioner caspases. Symbiotic and phagocytized bacteria can also increase the level of apoptosis, as observed in hemocytes in C. gigas [125]. An up-

regulation of the abCaspase gene has also been described in
abalone after an experimental bacterial challenge [47,136].
Apoptosis as a defense mechanism against disease has been
studied in oysters infected by the protistan parasites Perkinsus
[123]. Apoptosis in hemocytes has been associated with the natural
resistance of C. gigas and the susceptibility of Crassostrea virginica to
in vivo and in vitro experimental infections with Perkinsus marinus
[39]. Apoptosis of infected cells without the induction of inflam-
mation could restrict the spread of the pathogen and protect the
integrity of nearby tissues [48,123].

The immune response against Perkinsus olseni has recently been
analyzed in experimentally infected Manila clam (Venerupis phil-
ippinarum) hemocytes using an immune-enriched oligo-micro-
array [110]. Microarray analyses revealed a significant increase in
the number of genes related to apoptotic cell death at the early
stages of the infection. Apoptosis was down-regulated at the mid-
dle stages of infection (between days 10 and 14) when the
expression of gene transcripts with GO terms “regulation of
endopeptidase activity involved in apoptosis” and “cellular disas-
sembly involved in execution phase of apoptosis” were down-
regulated. However, apoptosis rebounded at the end of the exper-
iment when the pathogen was potentially re-infecting healthy cells.
TUNEL assays were conducted in histological preparations of
infected Manila clam. TUNEL assay is a method for detecting DNA
fragmentation in apoptotic cells by labeling the terminal end of
nucleic acids with a fluorescently-modified dUTPs. Apoptotic cells
show green fluorescence when observed by UV-light microscopy.
This assay confirms the involvement of apoptosis during P. olseni
infection (Fig. 3). A high number of apoptotic cells (stained in
green) were detected in the mantle and gills (at day 5) as well as in
connective tissues between muscular fibers surrounding the
digestive gland (at days 14 and 31).

### 4. Concluding remarks

Apoptosis in mollusks is similar in complexity to apoptosis in
vertebrates but also has unique features that may be related to
specific requirements imposed by the sedentary nature of some
stages in their life cycle and their immunological response to
recurrent exposures to environmental changes, pollutants and
pathogens. The flexibility of the apoptotic system in mollusks could
be responsible for the ecological success of mollusks, reflecting the
ability to modify different physiological functions when the envi-
ronment imposes strict conditions.

The characterization of the mechanisms of apoptotic signaling
pathways in mollusks may help us to develop new tools for the
evaluation of genotoxic risk through the use of terrestrial and
aquatic mollusks exposed to environmental pollutants. Probably
with the different wide transcriptomics/genomic projects that are
