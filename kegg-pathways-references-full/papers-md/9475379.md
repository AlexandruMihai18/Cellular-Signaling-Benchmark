## ABSTRACT

The peptide hormone prolactin (PRL) is known to regulate numerous target tissues. Among the less well-known targets are cells of the immune system, including T cells, B cells, and macrophages. Our laboratory has cloned a panel of PRL-inducible T-cell activation genes for use in studies investigating how PRL modulates the biology of cells of the immune system. This article focuses on two such PRL-inducible genes. One is a transcription factor called interferon regulatory factor-1, whose expression is regulated by signaling molecules along the PRL-inducible JAK/Stat signaling pathway. These signaling molecules include Stat1 and CBP as positive mediators and, unexpectedly, Stat5b as a negative mediator. A second PRL-inducible gene is c15/RNUDC, a novel nuclear movement protein, which may provide a link between PRL signaling and signaling via the lipid second messenger, platelet activating factor.

## INTRODUCTION

Many studies support a role of prolactin (PRL) in modulating the immune response (see recent review [1] and references therein). Altered PRL levels often correlate with immune dysfunctions in animal models [2] as well as in certain autoimmune diseases [3]. In ex vivo and in vitro studies, PRL stimulates T- and B-cell proliferative responses, promotes T-helper 1 responses [4], and activates macrophage effector functions [5]. These actions of PRL are mediated via the PRL receptor (PRL-R), which is a member of the hematopoietin/cytokine receptor superfamily [6]. PRL-R appears to be ubiquitously expressed on hematopoietic cells. PRL-R levels are highest on B cells, followed by macrophages and then T cells, although the levels of PRL-R can be further increased during T cell activation [7]. Finally, certain T lymphocyte subsets can synthesize and secrete bioactive PRL, which can act as an autocrine or paracrine factor [8, 9]. Together, these studies provide a wide basis from which we can begin to understand PRL action on the immune system.

### JAK/Stat Signaling Pathway

Our understanding of how PRL delivers diverse signals to target cells was facilitated by the elucidation that the PRL-R is a cytokine receptor that signals through the JAK/Stat pathway, first described for the interferon (IFN) receptor system [6] (Fig. 1). In the general JAK/Stat signaling paradigm, receptors homodimerize or form larger multimeric complexes upon ligand binding. This brings together the associated protein tyrosine kinases of the JAK/Tyk family [10], which then transphosphorylate each other, leading to increased JAK kinase activity. Activated tyrosine kinases in turn phosphorylate tyrosine residues on the receptor cytoplasmic domain, which provide “docking sites” for the recruitment of SH2-containing signaling molecules [11]. These include a family of latent, pre-existing transcription factors, called “signal transducers and activators of transcription” (Stat) [6]. Stat factors are recruited to the receptor, become tyrosine-phosphorylated, presumably by JAK tyrosine kinase, form homodimers or hetero-complexes, translocate into the nucleus, bind to cognate DNA elements, and regulate gene transcription. Recent studies have also shown that the transcriptional activities of Stat factors are further modulated by interactions with other DNA binding proteins [12, 13] and non-DNA binding co-activator proteins [14–16].

We have analyzed PRL signaling through the study of multiple components of the JAK/Stat signaling pathway in T cells. These include PRL-R, lymphocyte-derived PRL, JAK and Stat signaling molecules, and a panel of PRL-inducible T cell activation genes [1]. As a model system for studying PRL-inducible growth response genes, the rat Nb2 T lymphoma cell line was employed, which was originally established from the lymph node of an estrogen-treated male rat [17]. These cells represent immature T lymphocytes that are phenotypically CD4⁻, CD8⁺, and TCR⁺ [18]. They express a high number of high-affinity PRL-Rs and are dependent on PRL for growth [19]. Nb2 T cells can be made quiescent by being cultured in PRL-deficient medium for 24 h and then stimulated to grow with 1–10 ng/ml of PRL. Using these conditions, we cloned 26 PRL-responsive genes by differential hybridization [20]. One of the most PRL-inducible genes was that for the IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1).

### IRF-1

IRF-1 was originally cloned as a transcription factor involved in IFNβ gene expression in virus-infected fibroblasts, as part of the anti-viral, anti-proliferative pathway [21]. IRF-1 is also a tumor-suppressor gene [22]. In myeloid cells, IRF-1 is induced by a number of cytokines as part of a myeloid differentiation pathway [23, 24]. In macrophages, IRF-1 regulates activation and effector functions [25]. In B lymphocytes, IRF-1 may be involved in differentiation and apoptosis of B-cell precursors in the bone marrow [26]. In T lymphocytes, IRF-1 is critical for Th1 development and responses [27] as well as for both proliferation and apoptosis of T cells. Thus, IRF-1 is a multifunctional transcription factor (see Fig. 7).

#### IRF-1 Transcription

In Nb2 T cells, PRL stimulates the biphasic transcription of the IRF-1 gene over a single cell cycle, as measured by nuclear run-on transcription assays [28]. The transcription rate of the IRF-1 gene is first rapidly induced within 15 min, reaches a peak of 20-fold at 1 h during early G1, and declines to basal levels by 4 h. This G1 peak is followed by a second rise in the rate of IRF-1 gene transcription

between 8 and 12 h during early S phase. Interestingly, the transcription rate of a 1.7-kilobase (kb) 5′ flanking IRF-1 promoter CAT reporter construct mimicked the biphasic transcription profile of the endogenous IRF-1 gene. This suggests that the 1.7-kb IRF-1 flanking DNA contains elements that mediate both G1 and S phase transcriptional responses (Fig. 2a). In contrast, the 0.2-kb IRF-1 promoter region can mediate G1 induction by PRL only at 1 h and is unable to promote S phase transcription at 10–12 h (Fig. 2b). These results show that the promoter proximal –200-base pair (bp) region contains primarily G1 PRL responsive elements (PRL-REs).

Further deletions coupled with transfection analyses of the 0.2-kb IRF-1 promoter localized a minimal PRL re-

FIG. 3. Impaired signaling of the PRL-R mutants. Three Nb2 PRL-R PRM mutants, FV, P1P2, and P2P3 [32] and two tyrosine mutants, Y309F and Y382F [59], were assessed in transient transfection into the COS transfection system [30]. The ability of these mutant PRL-Rs to mediate PRL stimulation of the 1.7-kb IRF-1-CAT reporter and Stat1 binding to the IRF-1 GAS, as assayed by EMSA, were measured.

responsive region, between –100 bp and –200 bp, in the IRF-1 promoter [28]. Within this region lies an IFN Gamma Activated Sequence, or GAS, which is known to mediate cytokine stimulation of the IRF-1 gene in many cell types [29]. GAS is a palindromic sequence made up of two GAAA inverted repeats, TTTC NNN GAAA. To further define GAS as a PRL-RE, the GAS element was mutated in the context of the 1.7-kb IRF-1 promoter, and the mutant 1.7-kb IRF-1-CAT construct was transiently cotransfected with the Nb2 PRL-R construct into COS cells (referred to as the COS transfection system). Mutations in the single GAS element not only reduced basal promoter activity but also abrogated PRL stimulation of the 1.7-kb IRF-1 promoter [30]. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSA) using the GAS oligo as a probe showed that Stat1 is a major component and Stat5 is a minor component of the G1 IRF-1 GAS complex [31]. These studies show that the GAS is a critical element in mediating PRL signaling to the IRF-1 promoter and can be used as a readout for PRL-R mediated signaling events.

PRL-R Mutations

To determine which region of the PRL-R cytoplasmic domain is important for mediating PRL signaling to the IRF-1 promoter, several mutations in the highly conserved proline-rich motif (PRM) [32] region of the PRL-R were generated, as this region is important for receptor interaction with the JAK2 tyrosine kinase (Fig. 3). We obtained two other receptor mutants, each containing a single tyrosine to phenylalanine mutation [33]. In our COS transfection system, all three PRM mutants failed to signal to the IRF-1 promoter, presumably because they can no longer engage JAK2 in signal transduction. Both PRL-R tyrosine mutants were also impaired in signaling to the IRF-1 promoter. This is in contrast to PRL signaling to another PRL-inducible promoter, the β-casein promoter, which is depen-

Data are summarized from six independent experiments, each assayed in triplicate.

activation of the IRF-1 promoter. This inhibition is specific, as Stat5b mediated PRL induction of the β-casein promoter in the same COS transfection system. These studies show that Stat5b can act as a transcriptional repressor or activator, depending on the target promoter. To determine which part of Stat5b might be involved in repression, two Stat5b mutants were examined. One is missing the first 46 amino acids at the N terminus (Stat5bΔ46N) [35], and the other is missing the last 40 amino acids of its C terminus transactivation domain (Stat5bΔ40C) [36]. Neither the N nor the C terminus Stat5b deletion mutant was able to function as the wild type Stat5b, that is, either inhibit the IRF-1 promoter or activate the β-casein promoter. Thus, both termini of the Stat5b molecule are involved in Stat5b inhibition of the IRF-1 promoter.

Stat5b DNA Binding Mutant  

Since Stat5b is a DNA binding protein, it is possible that Stat5b inhibits the IRF-1 promoter by competitive binding with Stat1 at the IRF-1 GAS. We generated a Stat5b mutant that contains mutations in the conserved VVVI residues in the DNA binding domain [35]. Gel shift assays showed that this Stat5b DNA binding mutant could no longer bind to the IRF-1 GAS, yet transfection studies showed that this Stat5b DNA binding mutant could still inhibit the IRF-1 promoter as effectively as the wild type Stat5b. On the other hand, this Stat5b DNA binding mutant could no longer activate the β-casein promoter. Therefore, although Stat5b can bind to the IRF-1 GAS in vitro, this DNA binding property is not required for Stat5b to inhibit the IRF-1 promoter in vivo. Our interpretation is that Stat5b does not compete for binding to the IRF-1 GAS, but instead, Stat5b competes for a factor that is necessary for PRL activation of the IRF-1 promoter.

Stat Regulation of the IRF-1 Promoter  

Our current working model of Stat regulation of the IRF-1 promoter is summarized in Figure 5. Stat1 is a positive regulator that mediates PRL signaling to the critical GAS element in the IRF-1 promoter. CBP, a co-activator, enhances Stat1 activation at the IRF-1 GAS. On the other hand, Stat5b is a negative regulator that inhibits PRL signaling to the IRF-1 promoter. We suggest that Stat5b binds or “squelches” a factor necessary for PRL activation of the IRF-1 promoter. Whether co-activators are involved in this inhibition is currently under investigation. We further suggest that the relative concentration and kinetics of nuclear translocation of Stat1 versus Stat5 can contribute to the

these genes along the $nud$ genetic pathway result in a nuclear movement defect in *A. nidulans*. Interestingly, the mammalian homologues of all of these $nud$ genes are involved in cellular as well as some form of intracellular movement.

### RnudC Complementation

To determine whether rat c15 can functionally complement or rescue the $nudC$ phenotype, we transformed c15 into the $nudC3$ mutant strain of *A. nidulans* for complementation assays. At the permissive temperature, nuclei of $nudC3$ mutants move out evenly into the elongated germ tube [45]. However, at the restrictive temperature, these nuclei failed to migrate, and the germlings appeared short and stubby. In the c15 transformants at the restrictive temperature, the nuclei recovered their normal movement into the germ tube, and the germlings regained their elongated morphology. Together, these results show that rat c15 can functionally complement the $nudC$ defects and can be considered a functional homologue of $nudC$. Thus, c15 has been renamed rat $nudC$ or $RnudC$.

### RNUDC Expression and Immunolocalization

By Western blot analysis using affinity-purified rabbit anti-RNUDC antibodies, RNUDC protein is found to be expressed abundantly in rat Nb2 T cells, mouse premyeloid and neuroblastoma cells, monkey kidney fibroblasts, and human adenocarcinoma cells [46]. This protein expression profile is consistent with RNUDC's being a highly conserved protein. Immunofluorescent staining of the large and flat human adenocarcinoma cells further localized RNUDC not only in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region of the cell, but also particularly concentrated to one side of the nucleus, where the centrosome or microtubule organizing center (MTOC) is localized [46]. Since the MTOC often co-localizes with the Golgi apparatus, the cells were double-stained with anti-tubulin to stain the MTOC, and with two Golgi markers, a 58-kDa protein [47] and wheat germ agglutinin to visualize the Golgi apparatus. These studies show that RNUDC is cytoplasmic and that a significant amount of RNUDC is concentrated in the perinuclear MTOC/Golgi region in these mammalian cells.

### RNUDC Interacts with LIS

One way to address potential function of the abundant RNUDC protein in mammalian cells is to ask whether RNUDC interacts with other cellular proteins. To do so, RNUDC was cloned into the Glutathione-S-Transferase (GST) bacterial expression system and used in an interactive assay to “pull down” associated proteins. Using [$^{35}$S]methionine-labeled Nb2 T cell extracts, a prominent band of about 50 kDa was specifically and reproducibly retained by the GST-fusion protein and not by the control GST matrix. With a combination of pure luck and good guess-work based on our understanding of the $nud$ genetic pathway, we determined, using anti-LIS antibodies provided by Dr. Orly Reiner, that the 50-kDa RNUDC interacting protein is related to the mammalian NUDF homologue, i.e., the 49-kDa LIS protein (Fig. 6). Details of these studies will be presented elsewhere (unpublished results). Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that in addition to a genetic association, there is also a biochemical interaction between RNUDC and LIS in vitro. Whether RNUDC and LIS interact in vivo is currently under investigation.

rapid up- and down-regulation of IRF-1 gene transcription during both G1 and S phase in PRL-stimulated Nb2 T cells. These studies illustrate the complexity of Stat regulation of gene transcription. Stat factors can act as transcriptional activators or transcriptional repressors, depending on the target promoter, its surrounding sequences, and the presence of co-activators and promoter-specific DNA binding proteins. These complex interactions may underlie the ability of PRL to activate different target genes, that is, growth-related genes such as IRF-1 versus differentiation-specific genes, such as β-casein in the mammary gland or α2-macroglobulin in the ovary.

#### CLONE 15

A second PRL-inducible gene cloned from Nb2 T cells is a novel nuclear movement protein gene, which we initially called clone 15 (c15). Clone 15 mRNA is induced by PRL as early as 2 h and peaks between 8 and 10 h, right at the G1/S transition, preceding the onset of DNA synthesis. Thereafter, c15 mRNA levels return to basal by 24 h. Clone 15 encodes a 45-kDa protein containing 332 amino acids [37]. The N terminus contains a basic lysine- and arginine-rich motif, and an acidic aspartic acid- and glutamic acid-rich motif. These motifs may be involved in protein/protein interactions. The last 94 amino acids of c15 show a striking sequence similarity with a nuclear movement protein found in the filamentous fungus *Aspergillus nidulans* called NUDC [38]. The high degree of amino acid identity between the rat and *A. nidulans* proteins suggests a tremendous evolutionary pressure to conserve this domain for an important structure and/or function.

#### NUDC

During asexual division in *A. nidulans*, the nucleus of the conidium undergoes several divisions, after which the daughter nuclei move into and are distributed evenly throughout the germ tube [39]. At the restrictive temperature, the temperature-sensitive $nud$, or **nuclear distribution**, mutants fail to move the daughter nuclei into the germ tube. Additional mutations along the $nud$ genetic pathway (Fig. 6) have been isolated. These include $nudF$ [40], whose gene product is regulated by NUDC and is 42% identical to the product of the human $LIS-1$ gene, which is involved in neuronal migration in the brain [41]. Genetic studies suggest that NUDF regulates $nudA$ [42]. Furthermore, $nudA$ and $nudG$ [43] encode the cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain and light chain, respectively, of the microtubule-associated dynein motor protein complex. These gene products lie upstream of $tubA$ [44], which encodes tubulin, the basic building block of microtubules. Thus, mutations in any one of

Interestingly, biochemically, LIS is a subunit of the intracellular platelet-activating factor (PAF) acetylhydrolase (PAFAH) enzyme complex, which deacetylates and thereby inactivates PAF, the lipid second messenger. PAF is involved in multiple functions in the central nervous system [48] and reproductive tissues [49]. It is thought that LIS can modulate the activity of PAFAH enzyme complex [50] and thereby be indirectly involved in regulating the levels of active PAF within the cell. How PAFAH and PAF activities affect neuronal migration in the brain and whether these activities are activated in PRL-stimulated target cells is currently unclear. At this point, it is interesting to speculate on possible links between PRL signaling and PAF signaling. Our studies show that PRL stimulates RNUDC expression [37, 46], and RNUDC can associate with, and perhaps regulate, the levels of LIS in analogy with the A. nidulans pathway. In mammalian cells, LIS regulates PAFAH enzyme activities, which in turn determine the level of PAF in the cell. Hence, PRL may regulate PAF levels via these regulatory cascades and interactions. Experiments are under way to test the significance of these interactions.

We propose that upon PRL or cytokine stimulation, RNUDC expression is induced over the cell cycle as part of the proliferation pathway. In activated T cells, RNUDC may be involved in the reorganization and polarization of intracellular organelles—including the nucleus, the MTOC, its associated microtubules, and the Golgi apparatus—that occurs when T cells contact antigen-presenting cells [51]. RNUDC may also play a role in vesicle trafficking during normal growth and proliferation. Our studies suggest that RNUDC may provide another marker for the analysis of PRL signaling and nuclear/vesicular movement in certain PRL target cells.

### PRL Signaling in T Cells

In summary, our studies clarify various aspects of PRL signaling via the JAK/Stat pathway (Fig. 1). The membrane proximal region of the PRL-R is involved in mitogenic signaling and IRF-1 promoter activation. The membrane distal region of the PRL-R is involved in signaling to both the IRF-1 promoter and the β-casein promoter. JAK2 engagement at the PRL-R PRM is important for signaling to genes involved in both cellular proliferation and differentiation. At the level of signaling molecules, although Stat1 and Stat5 are both activated by PRL stimulation, their functional activities at different promoters is quite different. Stat1 activates the IRF-1 promoter, and this Stat1 activity is further enhanced by the co-activator CBP. In contrast, Stat5 inhibits the IRF-1 promoter through a novel mechanism that does not require it to bind to the IRF-1 GAS, but instead involves the squelching of a factor by Stat5 that is needed for PRL activation of the IRF-1 promoter. Studies are under way to test various co-activators as well as other factors found in the promoter proximal region of the IRF-1 promoter, for possible targets of Stat5 inhibition. On the other hand, Stat5 mediates PRL stimulation of the β-casein promoter. Understanding PRL signaling through the JAK/Stat pathway to growth-related versus differentiation-specific genes will help in elucidating how PRL can stimulate proliferation and differentiation or even prevent apoptosis in different target tissues.

number of immune processes (Fig. 7; see references in [1]). IRF-1 is involved in regulating the expression of IFN, IFN-stimulated genes, and the apoptotic gene ICE [52, 53], as part of an anti-viral and anti-proliferation program. IRF-1 has also been shown to regulate the expression of genes involved in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I expression, and thus it is involved in regulating not only antigen presentation but also CD8⁺ T-cell development in the thymus. In B cells, IRF-1 stimulates interleukin (IL)-7Rα expression and may be important for B cell differentiation in the bone marrow. In macrophages, IRF-1 regulates the expression of inducible nitrous oxide (NO) synthase, a gene crucial for macrophage effector functions. Recent IRF-1 knock-out animal studies have also shown that IRF-1 regulates the expression of the T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine IL-12p40, a cytokine critical for the development of Th1 responses [27, 54]. In view of the central role played by IRF-1 in these immune functions, the presence of PRL-R on hematopoietic cells, coupled with the recent generation of both PRL [55] and PRL-R [56] knock-out animals, we are in a position to test and define PRL as an immunoregulatory cytokine.
