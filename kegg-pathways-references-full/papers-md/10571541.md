Recent Advances in Cardiac  
$\beta_{2}$-Adrenergic Signal Transduction  

Rui-Ping Xiao, Heping Cheng, Ying-Ying Zhou, Meike Kuschel, Edward G. Lakatta  

Abstract—Recent studies have added complexities to the conceptual framework of cardiac $\beta$-adrenergic receptor ($\beta$-AR) signal transduction. Whereas the classical linear $G_{s}$–adenylyl cyclase–cAMP–protein kinase A (PKA) signaling cascade has been corroborated for $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation, the $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling pathway bifurcates at the very first postreceptor step, the G protein level. In addition to $G_{s}$, $\beta_{2}$-AR couples to pertussis toxin–sensitive $G_{i}$ proteins, $G_{i2}$ and $G_{i3}$. The coupling of $\beta_{2}$-AR to $G_{i}$ proteins mediates, to a large extent, the differential actions of the $\beta$-AR subtypes on cardiac $Ca^{2+}$ handling, contractility, cAMP accumulation, and PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation. The extent of $G_{i}$ coupling in ventricular myocytes appears to be the basis of the substantial species-to-species diversity in $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated cardiac responses. There is an apparent dissociation of $\beta_{2}$-AR–induced augmentations of the intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ ($Ca_{i}$) transient and contractility from cAMP production and PKA-dependent cytoplasmic protein phosphorylation. This can be largely explained by $G_{i}$-dependent functional compartmentalization of the $\beta_{2}$-AR–directed cAMP/PKA signaling to the sarcolemmal microdomain. This compartmentalization allows the common second messenger, cAMP, to perform selective functions during $\beta$-AR subtype stimulation. Emerging evidence also points to distinctly different roles of these $\beta$-AR subtypes in modulating noncontractile cellular processes. These recent findings not only reveal the diversity and specificity of $\beta$-AR and G protein interactions but also provide new insights for understanding the differential regulation and functionality of $\beta$-AR subtypes in healthy and diseased hearts.

Overview: Myocardial $\beta$-Adrenergic Receptors  

Adrenergic receptor (AR) stimulation by catecholamines provides the most important regulatory mechanism for cardiovascular performance. The adrenergic receptors were classified as $\alpha$ (for excitatory) and $\beta$ (for inhibitory) by Ahlquist<sup>1</sup> in 1948 on the basis of their functional behavior in blood vessels, ie, vasoconstriction versus vasodilation. Ahlquist’s classification was expanded by Lands et al.<sup>2</sup> who recognized that both $\alpha$- and $\beta$-ARs could be further categorized into 2 distinct subtypes based on their relative potencies for the ligands available at that time. The cloning of a cDNA for the human $\beta_{2}$-AR and subsequent studies indicate that the $\beta$-ARs are members of the G protein–coupled receptor superfamily, which shares a common feature, the 7-transmembrane-spanning domains.<sup>3,4</sup>

A dogma of cardiac $\beta$-AR signal transduction is that the agonist-bound $\beta$-AR selectively interacts with the stimulatory G protein ($G_{s}$), which activates adenylyl cyclase, catalyzing cAMP formation. Subsequently, activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) leads to phosphorylation of regulatory proteins involved in cardiac excitation–contraction (EC) coupling and energy metabolism, including L-type $Ca^{2+}$ channels, the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane protein phospholamban (PLB), myofilament proteins,

and glycogen phosphorylase kinase. PKA also phosphorylates and thereby activates an endogenous protein phosphatase inhibitor I, which further ensures the PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation by inhibiting protein phosphatases.<sup>5,6</sup> In addition to these acute effects, chronic $\beta$-AR stimulation affects multiple cellular functions, including gene transcription, cell growth, and death. After its activation, $\beta$-AR signaling is modulated at both the receptor level and downstream of the cascade by the coordinated actions of at least 3 groups of enzymes: G protein–coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), which phosphorylate and thus desensitize the receptor; cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs), which hydrolyze cAMP; and phosphatases, which dephosphorylate phosphoproteins.

Although several $\beta$-AR subtypes have been cloned and pharmacologically characterized, those expressed in cardiomyocytes were initially thought to be exclusively the $\beta_{1}$-AR subtype.<sup>2</sup> However, the traditional notion that only $\beta_{1}$-AR modulates cardiac contractile function has been challenged by recent studies that provide compelling evidence that at least both $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR functionally coexist in cardiomyocytes of many mammalian species, including humans. Many investigators have struggled to understand whether the coexpression of $\beta$-AR subtypes represents functional redund-

dancy. An alternative, but equally appealing, concept is that these $\beta$-AR subtypes mobilize identical signal transduction pathways but fulfill distinct physiological and pathophysiological roles. Another possibility is that $\beta$-AR subtypes elicit distinct cardiac responses through different signaling pathways. Over the past decade, increasing evidence has demonstrated striking qualitative and quantitative differences in the functions and signaling mechanisms of the cardiac $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR subtypes. In the present review, we will highlight recent advances in cardiac $\beta$-AR subtypes (particularly $\beta_{2}$-AR signal transduction) that reveal a new level of diversity and specificity of cardiac $\beta$-AR subtype stimulation and provide a conceptual framework for our understanding of the physiological and pathophysiological significance of the coexistence of receptor subtypes.

### Distinct $\beta$-AR Subtype Actions in the Heart

Despite many similarities, $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR are genetically and pharmacologically distinct entities. The amino acid sequences of human $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR share only 71% identity in the 7-transmembrane-spanning domains and 54% identity overall. ${ }^{3,4}$ Thus, it is plausible that $\beta$-AR subtypes could couple to distinct signal transduction pathways and elicit different cellular responses. In this section, we will examine evidence for qualitative and quantitative differences between $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR with respect to G protein coupling, cAMP handling, target protein phosphorylation, and modulation of cardiac EC coupling.

### $\beta$-AR Subtypes Differentially Regulate Ca${}^{2+}$ Handling and Contractility

Cardiac EC coupling is initiated by a Ca${}^{2+}$ influx through voltage-dependent sarcolemmal L-type Ca${}^{2+}$ channels during an action potential. This Ca${}^{2+}$ influx per se is insufficient to produce a contraction, but it triggers a large Ca${}^{2+}$ release from the SR via ryanodine receptors through a Ca${}^{2+}$-induced Ca${}^{2+}$ release mechanism. ${ }^{7}$ The resultant intracellular Ca${}^{2+}$ (Ca${}_{i}$) transient activates contractile proteins, producing a contraction; Ca${}_{i}$ is subsequently removed from the cytoplasm by the SR Ca${}^{2+}$-ATPase (Ca${}^{2+}$ pump) and the sarcolemmal Na${}^{+}$-Ca${}^{2+}$ exchanger. $\beta$-AR stimulation modulates virtually all of these important components of the cardiac EC coupling cascade and therefore plays a prominent role in the regulation of cardiac performance.

There are several striking physiological differences between $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR subtypes. In rat ventricular myocytes, whereas stimulation of both $\beta$-AR subtypes increases L-type Ca${}^{2+}$ currents ($I_{\mathrm{ca}}$), Ca${}_{i}$ transients, and contraction amplitude (positive inotropic effect), only $\beta_{1}$-adrenergic stimulation markedly accelerates the Ca${}_{i}$ transient decay and contractile relaxation (positive lusitropic or relaxant effect). ${ }^{8}$ The absence of $\beta_{2}$-AR-mediated cardiac relaxation has been also observed in many other mammalian species (eg, cat and sheep), ${ }^{9,10}$ but human and canine hearts are exceptions. ${ }^{11-14}$ Since $\beta$-AR-induced cardiac relaxation is mainly mediated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of PLB, an SR membrane protein, ${ }^{15,16}$ the different relaxant effects of $\beta$-AR subtypes may largely be attributable to their distinct effects on PLB phosphorylation (see below). Additionally, $\beta_{1}$-AR

but not $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation reduces Ca${}_{i}$-myofilament interaction. ${ }^{8}$ The differential regulation of myofilament sensitivity to Ca${}^{2+}$ by $\beta$-AR subtypes may be also related to the $\beta_{1}$-AR-induced phosphorylation of myofilament proteins (see below), which inhibits the myofilament response to Ca${}^{2+}$. Thus, both an increased SR Ca${}^{2+}$ uptake and a decreased myofilament Ca${}^{2+}$ sensitivity contribute to the relaxant effect after stimulation of $\beta_{1}$-AR but not $\beta_{2}$-AR. Concomitant with the enhanced SR Ca${}^{2+}$ recycling, only $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation increases the resting cytosolic Ca${}^{2+}$ and the likelihood of spontaneous Ca${}^{2+}$ oscillations in several mammalian species. ${ }^{8,17,18}$ This observation suggests that $\beta_{1}$-ARs may be more prone than $\beta_{2}$-ARs to elicit Ca${}^{2+}$-dependent arrhythmias. These functional differences between $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation suggest that there may be substantial differences in their intracellular signal transduction pathways.

#### $\beta_{2}$-AR-Stimulated Ca${}_{i}$ and Contractile Responses Can Be Dissociated From Global Increases in cAMP and PKA-Mediated Phosphorylation of Cytoplasmic Proteins

In rat ventricular myocyte preparations, the dose-response curve of total cAMP accumulation induced by $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation with norepinephrine (NE) overlaps that induced by $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation with zinterol. ${ }^{19}$ However, the maximal increase in the particulate cAMP induced by zinterol is $\approx 50 \%$ of that caused by $\beta_{1}$-AR, ${ }^{19}$ suggesting differential compartmentalization of cAMP after $\beta$-AR subtype stimulation. Surprisingly, the $\beta_{2}$-AR-stimulated increases in the particulate and total cAMP levels are apparently dissociated from the positive inotropic effect or the increase in Ca${}_{i}$ transients in adult rat myocytes; in contrast, $\beta_{1}$-AR-stimulated increase in cAMP in either fraction is closely correlated with the cardiac functional changes. ${ }^{19}$ A more striking example of this dissociation has been observed in canine cardiomyocytes, in which the $\beta_{2}$-AR-mediated augmentation of the Ca${}_{i}$ transient or contraction occurs in the absence of a measurable elevation of cAMP production. ${ }^{13,14}$

To elucidate $\beta$-AR subtype signaling downstream from cAMP, the PKA activity in both soluble and particulate fractions and the phosphorylation state of major regulatory proteins involved in cardiac EC coupling or in energy metabolism have been systematically examined in canine hearts. Stimulation of $\beta_{2}$-AR fails to increase PKA activity in either fraction. ${ }^{14}$ In both rat and canine ventricular myocytes, $\beta_{2}$-AR activation has only a negligible effect on PLB phosphorylation, ${ }^{13,14,19}$ relative to that after $\beta_{1}$-AR activation. These results obtained from single isolated cardiomyocytes have been recently validated in intact animals. Anesthetized dogs exhibited positive chronotropic, inotropic, and lusitropic effects during $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation, and these effects occur without a detectable increase in PKA activation or PKA-dependent phosphorylation of nonsarcolemmal target proteins, such as glycogen phosphorylase kinase in the cytoplasm, troponin I and C proteins in myofilaments, and PLB in the SR membrane. ${ }^{14}$ In contrast, $\beta_{1}$-AR-stimulated cardiac effects are well correlated with an increase in phosphorylation of these key regulatory proteins. ${ }^{13,14,19,20}$ Thus, the lack of PKA-mediated protein phosphorylation during $\beta_{2}$-AR

Dual coupling of cardiac $\beta_{2}$-AR to Gs and Gi proteins. The $\beta_{2}$-AR-coupled Gi activation functionally localizes the Gs-mediated adenyl cyclase (AC)-cAMP/PKA signaling to the subsarcolemmal microdomain, perhaps by stimulating PDE or protein phosphatases (PP). In contrast, $\beta_{1}$-AR couples exclusively to Gs protein.

stimulation in rat and dog hearts clearly indicates that, unlike $\beta_{1}$-AR, $\beta_{2}$-AR does not transmit its signal to cytoplasmic regulatory proteins, at least in these species. The reason is unclear for the PLB and troponin I phosphorylation-independent lusitropic effect of $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation in canine myocytes.

### Localized cAMP Signaling During Cardiac $\beta_{2}$-AR Stimulation

The aforementioned observations demonstrate that $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling modulates $I_{\text{Ca}}$ but cannot phosphorylate regulatory proteins remote from the cell surface membrane, suggesting that $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling is tightly localized near the subsarcolemmal microdomain, in the vicinity of L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels (Figure). More direct evidence supporting localized $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling has emerged from on-cell patch-clamp single L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel recordings. Although the effect of $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation is rather diffusive, the effect of $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation is extremely localized: the L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channel responds only to local (agonist included in pipette solution) but not remote (agonist added in bathing solution) $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation. These results are in general agreement with the observation that in frog cardiomyocytes, in which the $\beta_{2}$-AR subtype predominates, a local $\beta$-AR stimulation by isoproterenol applied to one end of the cell has little stimulatory effect on remote L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels.

These results, particularly those in canine hearts, initially evoked doubts as to whether $\beta_{2}$-AR cardiac response is mediated by a cAMP-dependent signaling pathway. It has been proposed that the cardiac effects of $\beta$-AR (subtype not specified) might be, in part, mediated by a direct interaction between Gs $\alpha$ subunits and L-type Ca$^{2+}$ channels. However, accumulating evidence indicates that the effect of $\beta$-AR stimulation on cardiac $I_{\text{Ca}}$ is mediated exclusively by a cAMP-dependent mechanism. To delineate a role of cAMP-dependent PKA activation in $\beta$-AR subtype signaling, specific PKA inhibitors, including Rp-cAMP, H-89, and a peptide PKA inhibitor (PKI), have been used. Most studies, except one in adult rat myocytes, have demonstrated that PKA inhibitors (Rp-cAMP and H-89) not only block the effect of $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation but also completely reverse the effects of $\beta_{2}$-AR. Similarly, in human and frog cardiac myocytes, the $\beta_{2}$-AR-induced augmentation of $I_{\text{Ca}}$ is totally prevented by PKI. Taken together, several lines of evidence strongly support the idea that cAMP-dependent PKA activation is obligatory for $\beta_{2}$-AR-mediated cardiac responses, but this $\beta_{2}$-AR-stimulated cAMP/PKA signaling in some species is highly localized to the surface membrane and cannot transmit to nonsarcomal proteins (Figure).

#### Dual Coupling of $\beta_{2}$-AR to Gs and Gi Proteins

In many biological systems, Gs and Gi proteins engage in cross talk with each other. This cross talk is usually mediated through different receptor families. For example, activation of muscarinic or adenosine receptors, prototypic Gi-coupled receptors, markedly antagonizes the positive inotropic effect of $\beta$-ARs. Interestingly, early work in lipid vesicles had demonstrated a physical potential for a single receptor to couple promiscuously to more than one class of G proteins. $\beta$-AR, for instance, couples to both Gs and Gi proteins. Using a photoaffinity labeling technique, recent studies have demonstrated such promiscuous G protein coupling of $\beta_{2}$-AR in intact cardiomyocytes, as manifested by a $\beta_{2}$-AR-stimulated incorporation of a photoreactive GTP analogue, [32P]GTP-azidoanilide, into $\alpha$ subunits of Gi2 and Gi3 in addition to Gs. The maximal effect of $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation on Gi proteins is comparable to that of carbachol, a muscarinic receptor agonist. Pertussis toxin (PTX) pretreatment or the $\beta_{2}$-AR antagonist (ICI 118,551) prevents the $\beta_{2}$-AR-mediated Gi activation. Because $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation is not able to increase Gi activity, the coupling to Gi is specific for $\beta_{2}$-AR subtype. Thus, $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling exemplifies a unique mode of receptor-G protein interaction; ie, a given receptor simultaneously activates more than one class of G proteins routing to functionally opposing pathways. Furthermore, $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR exhibit subtype-selective coupling to Gsa. A more recent in vitro study has revealed that $\beta_{2}$-AR couples to different split variants of Gsa and that the $\beta_{2}$-AR coupled to the long splice variant displays ligand-independent constitutive activity.

Mechanisms underlying the differential coupling of $\beta$-AR subtypes to G proteins are not well understood. At the molecular level, studies on chimeric or mutated G protein-coupled receptors (including the major subtypes of adrenergic receptors) have shown that the third cytoplasmic loop that connects transmembrane domains V and VI of these receptors is an important determinant for G protein coupling. For example, replacement of the cytoplasmic loop of muscarinic receptor with that of $\beta_{2}$-AR can induce Gs activation in response to muscarinic agonists. It has also been shown that a proline-rich region of the third intracellular loop determines the different Gs coupling and sequestration of $\beta_{1}$-AR versus
$\beta_{2}$-AR. ${ }^{33}$ Thus, the differences between $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR in G protein coupling could be eventually ascribed to some critical differences in the sequences of the cytoplasmic loop of the receptors. Recent evidence also suggests a potential role of posttranslation receptor modification in the receptor/G protein coupling. In HEK293 cells, PKA-mediated phosphorylation of $\beta_{2}$-AR switches the receptor coupling preference from $G_{s}$ to $G_{i} .{ }^{38}$ At the cellular level, it has been suggested that $\beta$-AR subtypes are located in 2 distinct cellular fractions after agonist stimulation: $\beta_{1}$-AR in caveolae and $\beta_{2}$-AR in coated pits. ${ }^{39,40}$ The difference in the subcellular distribution of $\beta$-AR subtypes may also contribute to their distinct G protein coupling and differences in signaling. In other words, $\beta_{2}$-ARs but not $\beta_{1}$-ARs might be geometrically colocalized with the $G_{i}$ proteins.

### Involvement of $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{i}$ Coupling in Local Control of $\beta_{2}$-AR–Stimulated cAMP Signaling

Functional localization of cAMP/PKA signaling could be ascribed to compartmentalization of cAMP or PKA per se (because of a localized activation of adenylyl cyclase or PDE) ${ }^{23,41}$ or to specific anchoring proteins of PKA. ${ }^{42,43}$ A close spatial association of L-type Ca $^{2+}$ channels with adenylyl cyclase and PKA ${ }^{42,44,45}$ would provide a structural basis for the $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated cAMP-dependent local regulation of the channel. Nevertheless, in view of the fact that both cAMP and active PKA catalytic subunits are readily diffusible, additional constrictive mechanisms must be involved in the local control of the $\beta_{2}$-AR cAMP/PKA signaling. In principle, this local control could also arise from counter–signal transduction pathways that locally negate the cAMP/PKA signaling.

Involvement of $\beta_{2}$-AR–coupled $G_{i}$ signaling in the compartmentalization of the $G_{s}$-mediated cAMP/PKA signaling has been investigated by using PTX to inhibit $G_{i}$ functions. In rat ventricular myocytes, PTX treatment, which has no significant effect on baseline parameters, specifically potentiates the $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated positive inotropic effect. ${ }^{46,47}$ More remarkably, PTX treatment permits $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation to induce a robust dose-dependent increase in PLB phosphorylation, ${ }^{48}$ accompanied by a marked relaxant effect. ${ }^{46,48}$ Thus, inhibition of $G_{i}$ proteins by PTX causes $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling to closely resemble that of $\beta_{1}$-AR. In contrast, the $\beta_{1}$-AR–mediated effects on cardiac EC coupling in rat ventricular myocytes are insensitive to PTX pretreatment, ${ }^{46,48}$ consistent with the inability of $\beta_{1}$-AR to activate $G_{i}$ proteins. ${ }^{28}$ These studies indicate that at least in rat cardiomyocytes, $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{i}$ coupling underlies the functional compartmentalization of the $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{s}$–directed cAMP/PKA signaling, which may largely account for the qualitative and quantitative differences between $\beta_{1}$-AR– and $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated cardiac actions.

It has been noted that in rat ventricular myocytes, PTX treatment has no significant effect on the $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated global cAMP accumulation ${ }^{27}$ or PKA activation. ${ }^{48}$ The simplest explanation for these observations is that the cross talk of $\beta_{2}$-AR–coupled $G_{i}$ and $G_{s}$ signaling occurs downstream from PKA rather than at the G protein or adenylyl cyclase level (Figure). In this regard, some evidence suggests that typical $G_{i}$-coupled receptors, such as the muscarinic receptor

M $_{2}$ or adenosine receptor A $_{1}$, counteract the effect of PKA, in part, via activation of protein phosphatases. ${ }^{49,50}$ The role of protein phosphatases in $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{i}$ signaling has been recently suggested. ${ }^{48}$ Alternatively, other evidence indicates that PDE is involved in the compartmentalization of $\beta$-AR–mediated cAMP signaling in canine ${ }^{41}$ and frog ${ }^{23}$ cardiac myocytes. Whether $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{i}$ coupling activates protein phosphatases, PDE, or other unknown second messengers to functionally compartmentalize the $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{s}$–directed cAMP/PKA signaling awaits further study (Figure).

#### Possible Role of pH $_{i}$ in Mediating the $\beta_{2}$-AR Positive Inotropic Response

Recently, a G protein–independent mechanism underlying a $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated cellular response has been demonstrated. ${ }^{51}$ Specifically, $\beta$-AR agonists can induce a direct physical association of Na $^{+}$-H $^{+}$ exchange (NHE) regulatory factor (NHERF), an inhibitor of Na $^{+}$-H $^{+}$ exchanger type 3 (NHE3), to the C-terminus of $\beta_{2}$-AR, relieving the inhibitory effect of NHERF on NHE3. Thus, $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation can exert opposing effects on NHE3 activity: a stimulatory effect induced by the direct association of $\beta_{2}$-AR with NHERF and an inhibitory effect mediated by PKA-dependent phosphorylation of NHERF, thereby activating NHERF. The relevance of this phenomenon to $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling in cardiomyocytes, however, has not yet been explored. It has been proposed that $\beta_{2}$-AR activation in adult rat ventricular myocytes increases pH $_{i}$, in a PKA-independent and Na $^{+}$-H $^{+}$-independent manner, resulting in an enhanced contractile response. ${ }^{29}$ In contrast, most studies have found that the $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated positive inotropic effect is closely related to a proportional increase in Ca $_{i}$ transient or $I_{\text {Ca }}{ }^{8,13,14,19,27,28}$ and can be completely reversed by specific PKA inhibitors. ${ }^{14,27,28,48}$ Quantitative studies are required to determine the relative contributions of changes of pH $_{i}$ and Ca $_{i}$ to the $\beta_{2}$-AR contractile response.

#### Diversity of Cardiac $\beta_{2}$-AR Signaling Among Mammalian Species

In addition to the differences in the behavior of $\beta$-AR subtypes within species, there is also a great diversity in $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated cardiac responses among species. At one extreme, in murine and guinea pig cardiomyocytes, $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation normally elicits no significant contractile response. ${ }^{28,52}$ In mouse cardiomyocytes, PTX treatment unmasks a de novo $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated contractile response. ${ }^{28}$ At the other extreme, in the chronically failing human atrium and ventricle, $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation induces positive inotropic and lusitropic effects and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins. ${ }^{11,12}$ Between these extremes, in isolated rat and canine ventricular myocytes, $\beta_{2}$-AR–mediated $I_{\mathrm{Ca}}$, Ca $_{i}$ transient, and contractile responses are present but can be further enhanced by PTX treatment. ${ }^{46,48}$ It is possible that this species-dependent diversity of cardiac $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling may be largely accounted for by differences in the extent of $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{i}$ coupling among species. For example, the $\beta_{2}$-AR/$G_{i}$ coupling would be expected to be extremely robust in mouse heart, but it might be less efficient in human hearts compared with mouse and rat hearts. It should be cautioned that most human studies have been conducted in preparations from chronically
failing hearts, and to date, no data are available on the effect of PTX on $\beta_{2}$-AR responsiveness in normal human myocardial preparations. Thus, it is not clear whether these pathophysiological conditions, such as chronic heart failure, influence the $\beta_{2}$-AR coupling to G$_{s}$ versus to G$_{i}$ proteins.

It is noteworthy that avian species appear to use markedly different signal transduction pathways. For example, in embryonic chick ventricular myocytes, $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation by zinterol increases the Ca$^{2+}$ transient and contractility by increasing arachidonic acid, which is negatively regulated by cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.$^{53}$

### Developmental Changes in Cardiac $\beta$-AR Subtype Signaling

In contrast to adult rat myocytes, $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation by zinterol in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes leads to increased intracellular cAMP accumulation and enhanced phosphorylation of PLB and troponin I, associated with an increase in the amplitude and an acceleration of the kinetics of the contraction and Ca$_{i}$ transient.$^{54}$ All of these responses are similar to those elicited by $\beta_{1}$-AR stimulation in neonatal rat myocytes. Interestingly, the dose-response curve of contraction in response to $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation by zinterol is shifted $\approx$2 orders of magnitude leftward in neonatal myocytes compared with adult myocytes. Thus, $\beta_{2}$-ARs may play a more important role in mediating the response to catecholamines in the noninnervated neonatal (or transplanted) heart than in the innervated adult heart. This developmental change in cardiac $\beta_{2}$-AR responsiveness is not due to a higher proportion of $\beta_{2}$-ARs in the neonatal heart, because the ratio of $\beta_{2}$-ARs to $\beta_{1}$-ARs is similar in both preparations.$^{54}$ It is noteworthy that the contractile dose-response relation to the $\beta_{2}$-AR agonist zinterol in neonatal rat myocytes$^{54}$ is similar to that in PTX-treated adult rat myocytes.$^{46}$ Thus, it might be speculated that the $\beta_{2}$-AR coupling to G$_{i}$ proteins might be acquired or reinforced during development, and this could explain the greater sensitivity of neonatal $\beta_{2}$-AR stimulation in the absence of PTX. In other words, in neonatal rat myocytes, the $\beta_{2}$-AR/G$_{i}$ coupling is lacking or insufficient to negate the G$_{s}$-mediated relaxant effect and phosphorylation of regulatory proteins.

### $\beta_{2}$-AR Signal Transduction in Genetically Manipulated Murine Models

Rapid advances in mouse genetics have provided powerful tools to unravel the molecular secrets that govern cardiovascular structure and function in health and disease. Several transgenic mouse models have been developed to manipulate $\beta$-AR signal transduction pathways.$^{55–58}$ In addition, $\beta_{1}$-AR or $\beta_{2}$-AR and $\beta_{1}$-$\beta_{2}$-AR double-knockout mice have recently been generated.$^{59–61}$ In this section, we will briefly discuss some principles and lessons learned from these transgenic and gene-targeted mice. Discussion involving genetic manipulation and $\beta$-AR signaling in the setting of cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure will be deferred to “Implications of $\beta_{2}$-AR Signaling in Heart Failure.”

### Spontaneous $\beta_{2}$-AR Activation

In TG4 transgenic mice, cardiac-specific overexpression of $\beta_{2}$-AR by $\approx$200-fold leads to an agonist-independent enhancement in both the baseline adenylyl cyclase activity and myocardial contractility in vivo$^{55}$ and in isolated atria$^{57}$ or single cardiomyocytes.$^{28}$ This transgenic model opens a new avenue in the study of ligand-free $\beta$-AR signaling. According to the prevailing 2-state model, G protein-coupled receptors, like $\beta$-ARs, exist in an equilibrium between 2 functionally and conformationally distinct states: an inactive conformation (R) and an active conformation capable of activating G proteins (R*).$^{55,57,62}$ In the absence of a receptor ligand, the receptor can undergo a spontaneous transition to the activated state; the equilibrium between R and R* sets the level of basal receptor activation. Thus, an overexpression of a given receptor would be expected to proportionally increase the number of R* state receptors. Receptor agonists have a higher affinity for R*, thereby shifting the equilibrium to the active conformation R*. Neutral antagonists bind with equal affinity to R and R*, and therefore inhibit receptor signaling without altering the equilibrium between R and R*. A third class of receptor ligands known as inverse agonists preferentially binds to R, driving the equilibrium toward the inactive conformation R. As shown in TG4 mice, the enhanced basal cardiac adenylyl cyclase activity and contraction are reversed by a $\beta_{2}$-AR inverse agonist, ICI 118,551, both in vivo and in vitro.$^{28,55,57}$ At the moment, it is unclear whether $\beta_{1}$-AR and $\beta_{2}$-AR have similar abilities to undergo spontaneous activation.

#### Spontaneous and Agonist-Induced Active $\beta_{2}$-ARs Exhibit Different Signaling

Although a 2-state model for the adrenergic receptor is sufficient to explain many aspects of $\beta_{2}$-AR activation, multiple active functional states of the receptor have been demonstrated.$^{63–65}$ This idea is reinforced by several important differences between spontaneously activated $\beta_{2}$-ARs and agonist-stimulated $\beta_{2}$-ARs in TG4 cardiomyocytes. First, whereas spontaneously active $\beta_{2}$-ARs significantly increase the baseline contractility of the TG4 heart, $\beta_{2}$-AR agonists, at maximal concentrations, are unable to further increase contraction amplitude, even though the contractility is not yet saturated. Second, whereas $\beta_{2}$-AR agonists induce a marked increase in $I_{Ca}$, ligand-independent constitutive $\beta_{2}$-AR activation increases cardiac contractility but cannot modulate $I_{Ca}$. $^{66}$ Finally, spontaneously activated $\beta_{2}$-ARs and agonist-stimulated $\beta_{2}$-ARs may differentially couple to G$_{i}$ proteins, because PTX robustly enhances the $\beta_{2}$-AR agonist-mediated contractile response but only slightly enhances the effect of spontaneous $\beta_{2}$-AR signaling on basal contractility in TG4 heart cells.$^{28}$ These occurrences suggest that spontaneously active $\beta_{2}$-ARs and agonist-activated $\beta_{2}$-ARs may represent functionally distinct conformational states of the receptor.

### Compensatory Changes in Genetically Manipulated Animal Models

A peculiar feature of TG4 mice is that $\beta_{2}$-AR overexpression causes a marked reduction in PLB expression, which contributes to the accelerated basal cardiac relaxation.$^{67}$ Additionally, in transgenic mice overexpressing G$_{s\alpha}$, there is a significant upregulation of $\beta$-adrenergic receptor kinase ($\beta$ARK).$^{68}$ In fact, in many transgenic models, a specific or even a global
remodeling process such as hypertrophy is accompanied by the upregulation or downregulation of a gene or set of genes^{69,70} (for a review, see Reference 71). Although these compensatory changes might be beneficial for the animal’s survival, they introduce complications in understanding their phenotypes. Thus, caution should be exercised when drawing a direct mechanistic link between genetic manipulations and phenotypes.

# Implications of $\beta_2$-AR Signaling in Heart Failure

A large body of evidence has demonstrated that the cardiac response to $\beta$-AR stimulation decreases in chronically failing hearts in human and animal models, and that there is a positive correlation between increased plasma catecholamine levels and the degree of the diminution of the $\beta$-AR response.^{72–75} The demonstration of promiscuous $\beta_2$-AR coupling to $G_s$ and $G_i$ also provides new insights into the pathogenesis of heart failure.

## Distinct Phenotypes Induced by Chronic $\beta_1$-AR Versus $\beta_2$-AR Stimulation

The $\beta$-AR subtypes have markedly different chronic effects on cardiac hypertrophy, as manifested by the distinct phenotypes of transgenic mice overexpressing cardiac $\beta_1$-AR versus $\beta_2$-AR. For example, vast overexpression of cardiac $\beta_2$-AR by $\approx$200-fold does not induce detectable cellular hypertrophy or heart failure, at least in the short term.^{28,55,57} In contrast, low level (5- to 15-fold) overexpression of $\beta_1$-AR results in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure.^{58} This phenotype is similar to that obtained by transgenic overexpression of cardiac $G_{\alpha}$ in mice^76 or by chronic $\beta$-AR stimulation by agonist infusion.^{77,78} Furthermore, heart-specific overexpression of $\beta_2$-AR at $\approx$30-fold not only rescues ventricular function but also reverses cardiac hypertrophy induced by transgenic overexpression of $G_{\alpha}$.^79 Emerging evidence also indicates that these $\beta$-AR subtypes even have opposing effects on apoptosis in cultured rat cardiomyocytes: $\beta_1$-AR stimulation induces apoptosis,^{80,81} whereas $\beta_2$-AR stimulation inhibits apoptosis.^{81,82} These studies shed new light on whether long-term $\beta$-AR stimulation is beneficial. Answering this question may require discriminating $\beta$-AR subtypes, because $\beta_1$-AR and $\beta_2$-AR have distinct, even opposite, chronic effects.

## Differential Regulation of $\beta_1$-AR Versus $\beta_2$-AR in Failing Hearts

Except for mitral valve disorder-induced heart failure,^83 most studies involving end-stage human heart failure^{73–75,84} and some heart failure animal models^{72,85} have shown a selective decrease in $\beta_1$-AR number with little or no loss of $\beta_2$-AR. The selective reduction in $\beta_1$-AR density may be attributed to elevated plasma levels of NE, which has a higher affinity for $\beta_1$-AR.^2 In the line of the distinct phenotypes of transgenic overexpression of $\beta_1$-AR versus $\beta_2$-AR, the selective downregulation of $\beta_1$-AR may reflect a protective mechanism in the failing heart. However, the $\beta_2$-AR-mediated cardiac response, similar to that of $\beta_1$-AR, is also significantly diminished.^{73–75,84,85} Next, we will discuss possible role of

$\beta_2$-AR/$G_i$ coupling in the loss of $\beta_2$-AR contractile response in heart failure.

## Upregulation of $G_i$ Proteins in Heart Failure

Studies in rat and guinea pig have shown that chronic infusion of catecholamines increases the expression of $G_i$.^{86,87} In transgenic mice, in which the human $\beta_2$-AR is overexpressed, the $G_i$ protein abundance is also significantly enhanced.^28 These results suggest that chronic $\beta$-AR stimulation elevates $G_i$ expression. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that heart failure is associated with elevated plasma catecholamine levels, which could result in an increase in $G_i$ protein abundance or function. Indeed, in chronic heart failure in both humans^{88,89} and animal models,^72 marked increases in $G_i$ mRNA levels, PTX-induced ribosylation, and $G_i$ abundance have been reported. Because the coupling of $\beta_2$-AR to $G_i$ proteins negatively regulates the $G_s$-mediated contractile response in the heart of many mammalian species,^{27,28,46–48} the enhanced $G_i$ signaling might serve as a mechanism underlying the diminution of the $\beta_2$-AR-stimulated positive inotropic effect. In human chronic heart failure, some evidence suggests that $G_i$ proteins may be also involved in the diminution of $\beta_1$-AR contractile response.^90

## G Protein-Coupled Receptor Kinases in Failing Hearts

Agonist-dependent desensitization can be initiated by phosphorylation of activated receptors by members of the GRK family.^91 $\beta$ARK1 is a prototypic GRK that has been shown to phosphorylate activated $\beta_1$-AR and $\beta_2$-AR subtypes in vitro.^{92,93} Phosphorylated receptors become binding substrates for a class of inhibitor proteins, $\beta$-arrestins, which inhibit further $G$ protein coupling.^94 Recently, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of a second myocardial GRK, GRK5, in transgenic mice also leads to significant cardiac $\beta$-AR uncoupling.^95 In chronic human heart failure, the levels and enzymatic activity of $\beta$ARK1 are significantly elevated.^96 In heart failure animal models, $\beta$ARK1 activity is also correlated with $\beta$-AR responsiveness.^97 Transgenic mice with myocardial overexpression of $\beta$ARK1 (3- to 5-fold) have a blunted contractile response to $\beta$-AR stimulation by isoproterenol^{56,98} or NE.^99 More strikingly, a genetic model of murine heart failure (MLP$-$/$-$) can be largely reversed by an overexpression of $\beta$ARK1 inhibitor.^100 Taken together, chronic heart failure is associated with a marked increase in $G_i$ proteins, a selective downregulation of $\beta_1$-AR (higher $\beta_2/\beta_1$), and an increased expression and activity of GRK2 ($\beta$ARK1). The exaggerated $\beta_2$-AR/$G_i$ signaling and the enhanced $\beta$ARK1 activity may contribute to the heart failure-associated dysfunction of $\beta$-AR stimulation and play a critical role in the pathogenesis of heart failure.

## Summary and Perspectives

In summary, recent studies have demonstrated that the cardiac $\beta_1$-AR and $\beta_2$-AR are markedly different regarding to $G$ protein coupling, cAMP handling, target protein phosphorylation, and modulation of cardiac EC coupling. Many of these differences can be explained by the additional coupling of $\beta_2$-AR to $G_i$ proteins, which, in some species and dev-
opmental stages at least, functionally localizes the $\beta_{2}$-AR/G$_{s}$-mediated cAMP/PKA signaling to the subsarcolemmal microdomain. This $\beta_{2}$-AR/G$_{i}$ pathway may also contribute to the distinct phenotypes of overexpression of cardiac $\beta_{2}$-ARs versus $\beta_{1}$-ARs in transgenic mouse models. Thus, it is necessary and important to distinguish $\beta_{2}$-ARs from $\beta_{1}$-ARs with regard to their physiological and pathophysiological roles.

Many important questions remain to be answered. Further studies are required to determine the molecular, structural, and microarchitectural bases underlying the differential G protein coupling of $\beta_{2}$-AR versus $\beta_{1}$-AR. Information on downstream signaling of $\beta_{2}$-AR-coupled G$_{i}$ proteins only begins to emerge. In addition, studies of the chronic noncontractile effects of cardiac $\beta$-AR subtype stimulation, eg, on cardiac cell growth and death, will broaden and deepen our understanding of the differential regulation and functionality of $\beta$-AR subtypes in health and disease. Finally, the possible role of $\beta_{2}$-AR/G$_{i}$ coupling in the pathogenesis of chronic heart failure merits future investigation.
