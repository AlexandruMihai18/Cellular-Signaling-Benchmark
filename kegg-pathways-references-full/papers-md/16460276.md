Key Words MLC₂₀ phosphorylation, MLC phosphatase, Rho kinase, ZIP kinase, integrin-linked kinase

■ Abstract Phosphorylation of Ser¹⁹ on the 20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin II (MLC₂₀) by Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) is essential for initiation of smooth muscle contraction. The initial [Ca²⁺]i transient is rapidly dissipated and MLCK inactivated, whereas MLC₂₀ and muscle contraction are well maintained. Sustained contraction does not reflect Ca²⁺ sensitization because complete inhibition of MLC phosphatase activity in the absence of Ca²⁺ induces smooth muscle contraction. This contraction is suppressed by staurosporine, implying participation of a Ca²⁺-independent MLCK. Thus, sustained contraction, as with agonist-induced contraction at experimentally fixed Ca²⁺ concentrations, involves (a) G protein activation, (b) regulated inhibition of MLC phosphatase, and (c) MLC₂₀ phosphorylation via a Ca²⁺-independent MLCK. The pathways that lead to inhibition of MLC phosphatase by Gq/13-coupled receptors are initiated by sequential activation of Gαq/α₁₃, RhoGEF, and RhoA, and involve Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of MLC phosphatase (MYPT1) and/or PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17, an endogenous inhibitor of MLC phosphatase. Sustained MLC₂₀ phosphorylation is probably induced by the Ca²⁺-independent MLCK, ZIP kinase. The pathways initiated by Gi-coupled receptors involve sequential activation of Gβγi, PI 3-kinase, and the Ca²⁺-independent MLCK, integrin-linked kinase. The last phosphorylates MLC₂₀ directly and inhibits MLC phosphatase by phosphorylating CPI-17. PKA and PKG, which mediate relaxation, act upstream to desensitize the receptors (VPAC₂ and NPR-C), inhibit adenyl cyclase and guanylyl cyclase activities, and stimulate cAMP-specific PDE3 and PDE4 and cGMP-specific PDE5 activities. These kinases also act downstream to inhibit (a) initial contraction by inhibiting Ca²⁺ mobilization and (b) sustained contraction by inhibiting RhoA and targets downstream of RhoA. This increases MLC phosphatase activity and induces MLC₂₀ dephosphorylation and muscle relaxation.

INTRODUCTION

Smooth muscle of the gut possesses distinct regional and functional properties that distinguish it from other types of visceral and vascular smooth muscle. Smooth muscle of the proximal stomach, sphincters, and gall bladder exhibits sustained tone, whereas smooth muscle of the distal stomach, small intestine, and colon exhibits variable tone on which are superimposed rhythmic contractions driven by cycles of membrane depolarization and repolarization known as slow waves (1–5). These cycles originate in pacemaker cells located at the boundaries and in the substance of the inner, circular muscle layer, from which they spread to the outer, longitudinal muscle layer (4, 5). The depolarization phase primarily reflects activation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels, resulting in Ca²⁺ entry and contraction. Concurrent stimulation of rhythmic smooth muscle by excitatory neurotransmitters, chiefly acetylcholine and tachykinins, causes further depolarization and Ca²⁺ entry and activates signaling cascades that result in a transient Ca²⁺ release (1, 6–8). Stimulation of tonic smooth muscle by excitatory neurotransmitters causes transient Ca²⁺ release and contraction followed by a sustained Ca²⁺-independent contraction. The molecular mechanisms underlying these processes in tonic smooth muscle are the subject of this review.

SIGNALING FOR CONTRACTION IN SMOOTH MUSCLE OF THE GUT

Receptors and G Proteins

The apparatus of signal transduction in smooth muscle cells consists of three types of membrane-bound proteins: (a) a membrane-spanning receptor, (b) a GTP-binding protein that couples to the receptor, and (c) effector enzymes capable of generating cascades of intracellular regulatory signals. The ligands for these receptors in smooth muscle of the gut are derived mainly from enteric excitatory motor neurons (e.g., acetylcholine, tachykinins), from smooth muscle cells [e.g., sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), endocannabinoids], and to lesser extents from adventitious cells and via the circulation (6–10). A large variety of receptors and receptor subtypes have been identified as capable of mediating smooth muscle contraction. Among these are receptors for peptides (e.g., tachykinins, endothelin, motilin), amines (histamine, 5-hydroxytryptamine), pyrimidines/purines (UTP and ATP), and lipids (S1P, LPA) (11–18). Muscarinic m2 and m3 receptors are the predominant receptor types, although only m3 receptors mediate contraction (19, 20) (Table 1). All of these receptors are uniformly distributed in smooth muscle cells of the outer, longitudinal muscle layer and the densely innervated, inner circular muscle layer, with the exception of somatostatin, opioid, and neuropeptide Y (NPY) Y₂ and Y₄ receptors, which are absent from smooth muscle cells of the longitudinal muscle layer (21–23).

*The pattern of signaling by m3 receptors involving $G_{q}$ and $G_{13}$ is also seen with endothelin $ET_{A}$ and motilin receptors. G protein-coupling of serotonin 5-HT$_{2c}$, histamine H₁, and tachykinin NK₁/NK₂ receptors is probably similar to that of m3 receptors, although activation of $G_{13}$ has not yet been examined. $ET_{B}$ receptors are coupled to $G_{q}$, but not $G_{13}$, and do not activate RhoA. Sphingosine-1 phosphate (S1P₂) receptors and purine/pyrimidine ($P_{2Y2}$) receptors are coupled to $G_{q}/G_{13}$ and to various isoforms of $G_{i}$. $Y_{2}$ and $Y_{4}$ receptors are coupled to $G_{q}$ and $G_{i2}$ but do not signal via $G\beta\gamma_{i}$. Opioid $\mu,\delta,\kappa$; somatostatin sstr₃; and adenosine A₁ receptors are coupled to various isoforms of $G_{i}$ and signal in similar fashion via $G\alpha_{i}$ and $G\beta\gamma_{i}$. Muscarinic m2 receptors are coupled to the same G proteins as A₁ receptors, but they signal atypically, as detailed in the text. Cannabinoid $CB_{1}$ receptors are coupled to an atypical G protein complex ($G\alpha_{i2}-G\beta_{5}$-RGS6) and signal via $G\alpha_{i2}$ only.

## Effector Enzymes

PHOSPHOLIPASE C-$\beta$1 AND PLC-$\beta$3 Receptors mediating contraction in smooth muscle of the gut are coupled to $G_{q}$, $G_{i}$, or both. For example, m3, $ET_{A}$ and $ET_{B}$, and 5-HT₂ receptors are coupled to $G_{q}$, somatostatin sstr₃, opioid $\mu$, $\delta$, and $\kappa$; adenosine A₁ receptors are coupled to various isoforms of $G_{i}$; and S1P₂ and P2Y₂ receptors are coupled to both $G_{q}$ and $G_{i}$ (12, 15–17, 20–24). All of the receptors stimulate phosphoinositide (PI) hydrolysis by activating phospholipase C (PLC) - $\beta$1 via $G\alpha_{q}$ and/or PLC-$\beta$3 via $G\beta\gamma_{i}$. Although all four PLC-$\beta$ isozymes are expressed in smooth muscle cells of the gut, neither PLC-$\beta$2 nor PLC-$\beta$4 is activated

(Table 1). PLC-$\beta$1 is activated via binding of its COOH-terminal tail, a characteristic feature of PLC-$\beta$ isozymes, to G$\alpha_{q}$, whereas PLC-$\beta$3 is activated via binding of its NH$_{2}$-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain to G$\beta$$\gamma_{i}$ (25). In circular smooth muscle cells, as in most cell types, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP$_{2}$) is the predominant phosphoinositide substrate hydrolyzed by PLC-$\beta$1 or PLC-$\beta$3, resulting in generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and the diffusible Ca$^{2+}$-mobilizing messenger, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP$_{3}$) (26). In longitudinal smooth muscle cells, however, the predominant phosphoinositide substrate hydrolyzed by PLC-$\beta$1 or PLC-$\beta$3 is phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate, yielding inositol 1,4-bisphosphate (IP$_{2}$), an ineffective Ca$^{2+}$-mobilizing product, and DAG (26). In both cell types, activation of PLC-$\beta$ is transient (<2 min) and occurs mainly during the initial phase of contraction (26, 27).

PHOSPHOLIPASE D G$_{q}$/G$_{13}$-coupled receptors mediating contraction also activate phosphatidylcholine (PC)-specific PLC and phospholipase D (PLD). Activation of these enzymes occurs mainly, but not exclusively, during the sustained phase of contraction. In smooth muscle cells of the gut, m3, ET$_{A}$, and S1P$_{2}$ receptors activate PLD sequentially via G$_{13}$ and the monomeric G protein/GTPase RhoA (12, 17, 20, 28, 29). Phosphatidic acid, the primary product of PLD activity, is dephosphorylated to DAG, which causes sustained activation of protein kinase C (PKC). Formation of DAG and activation of PKC are biphasic, with an early peak coinciding with PI hydrolysis followed by a sustained increase reflecting PC-PLC and PLD activities (28).

PLC-$\delta$1 G$_{i}$-coupled receptors do not activate G$_{13}$, RhoA, or PLD in smooth muscle cells of the gut yet can cause transient PI hydrolysis by activating PLC-$\beta$3 via G$\beta$$\gamma_{i}$ as well as delayed PI hydrolysis by activating PLC-$\delta$1, the most widely expressed PLC-$\delta$ isozyme (30). Although the PH domain of PLC-$\delta$ binds G$\beta$$\gamma$, the binding is too weak to stimulate enzyme activity. PLC-$\delta$, which is highly sensitive to Ca$^{2+}$ and is typically activated by intracellular Ca$^{2+}$ concentrations in the range of 0.1–1 $\mu$M, appears to be preferentially activated by Ca$^{2+}$ influx via capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ channels (30, 31). PLC-$\delta$1 activity in smooth muscle of the gut is minimally inhibited by blockade of voltage-gated Ca$^{2+}$ channels but is strongly inhibited by blockade of store-operated Ca$^{2+}$ channels. Capacitative Ca$^{2+}$ influx induced by G$_{q}$-coupled receptors does not lead to activation of PLC-$\delta$1 because concurrent activation of RhoA blocks PLC-$\delta$1 activation. Inactivation of RhoA by the *Clostridium botulinum* C3 exoenzyme or by expression of a dominant-negative mutant of RhoA unmasks Ca$^{2+}$-stimulated PLC-$\delta$1 activity (30). The functional significance of PLC-$\delta$1 activity and resultant IP$_{3}$ formation in the context of depleted sarcoplasmic Ca$^{2+}$ stores is unclear. Furthermore, as noted below, the concurrent activation of PKC via PLC-$\delta$1 is not involved in the sustained contraction mediated by G$_{i}$-coupled receptors.

Figure 1 Signaling by muscarinic m3 and m2 receptors during the initial phase of contraction. Initial contraction and MLC₂₀ (20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin II) phosphorylation in circular smooth muscle are mediated exclusively by m3 receptors; m2 receptors do not cause contraction because they initiate a parallel pathway involving sequential activation of PI 3-kinase, Cdc42/Rac1, and PAK1, which results in PAK1-mediated inactivation of myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK). This inhibitory pathway is specific to m2 receptors and is not shared by other Gi-coupled receptors that cause initial contraction (e.g., δ-opioid, A₁, sstr₃). Both m3 and m2 receptors also activate cPLA₂ via distinct pathways involving ERK1/2 and p38 MAP kinase (p38 MAPK), respectively. A distinct mechanism for Ca²⁺ mobilization in longitudinal smooth muscle involving activation of cPLA₂ is described in the text. Signaling by other receptors is summarized in Table 1. CaM K II, calcium/calmodulin-activated kinase II; IP₃R-I, Type 1 IP₃ receptor; PI3K, PI 3-kinase; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.

CYTOPLASMIC PLA₂ Gq- and Gi-coupled receptors activate cytoplasmic PLA₂ (cPLA₂) via different mechanisms, as evidenced in the signaling cascades initiated by m3 and m2 receptors. Sustained stimulation of cPLA₂ activity via m3 receptors involves sequential activation of Gαq → PLC-β1 → PKC → ERK1/2 → cPLA₂, whereas sustained stimulation via m2 receptors involves sequential activation of Gβγᵢ → PI 3-kinase → Cdc42/Rac1 → PAK1 (p21-activated protein kinase 1) → p38 MAP kinase → cPLA₂. Both pathways result in phosphorylation of cPLA₂ at Ser⁵⁰⁵, and their effects are additive (32) (Figure 1).

CA²⁺ MOBILIZATION IN CIRCULAR AND LONGITUDINAL SMOOTH MUSCLE

The mechanisms of Ca²⁺ mobilization in smooth muscle cells of the circular and longitudinal muscle layers vary. In muscle cells from both layers, G protein– coupled agonists initiate contraction by increasing cytosolic Ca²⁺, or [Ca²⁺]i. Initial contraction of smooth muscle cells and the increase in [Ca²⁺]i are not affected by Ca²⁺ channel blockers or by withdrawal of extracellular Ca²⁺ in circular smooth muscle cells but are abolished in longitudinal smooth muscle cells. This implies that Ca²⁺ mobilization in longitudinal muscle is dependent upon an obligatory step involving Ca²⁺ influx (33–35).

### IP₃-Induced Ca²⁺ Release via IP₃R-I Receptors/Ca²⁺ Channels in Circular Smooth Muscle

Circular smooth muscle cells exhibit preferential PIP₂ hydrolysis and rapid IP₃ formation. Their sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ stores contain high-affinity IP₃ receptors/Ca²⁺ channels and release Ca²⁺ in response to low cytosolic concentrations of IP₃ (33). Two IP₃ receptors, IP₃R-I and IP₃R-III, are expressed in these cells, but only IP₃R-I mediates Ca²⁺ release (33, 36). Agonist-stimulated increase in [Ca²⁺]i is abolished by inhibitors of PI hydrolysis; upon depletion of sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ stores in intact muscle cells; and by treatment with Gαq antibodies, PLC-β antibodies, or IP₃ receptor inhibitors in permeabilized muscle cells (33, 36) (Figure 1).

### Ca²⁺- and Cyclic ADP Ribose–Induced Ca²⁺ Release via Ryanodine Receptors/Ca²⁺ Channels in Longitudinal Smooth Muscle

Longitudinal smooth muscle cells, which exhibit preferential hydrolysis of PIP, contain small amounts of PIP₂ and generate minimal amounts of IP₃. Their sarcoplasmic stores are devoid of high-affinity IP₃ receptors and exhibit minimal sensitivity to IP₃, but they possess high-affinity ryanodine receptors (Kd = 7 nM) and exhibit high sensitivity to Ca²⁺ (100–500 nM) and cyclic ADP ribose (EC₅₀ = 1 nM) (37, 38). Muscle cells from this layer possess membrane-bound ADP ribosyl cyclase, which can be activated in a concentration-dependent fashion to yield cyclic ADP ribose (38).

The search for a messenger that triggers Ca²⁺ influx and results in Ca²⁺- and cyclic ADP ribose–induced Ca²⁺ release led to arachidonic acid, a product of PC hydrolysis by cPLA₂ (39). An early transient peak in cPLA₂ activity, which precedes sustained cPLA₂ activity, is observed only in longitudinal smooth muscle cells. Blockade of peak activity with cPLA₂ inhibitors (or with GDPβS in reversibly permeabilized muscle cells) abolishes Ca²⁺ mobilization. Low concentrations of arachidonic acid applied exogenously induce membrane depolarization and the opening of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (39, 40). The entry of Ca²⁺

stimulates cyclic ADP ribose formation and induces synergistic Ca²⁺- and cyclic ADP ribose-induced Ca²⁺ release via ryanodine receptors/Ca²⁺ channels.

# INITIAL AND SUSTAINED MLC₂₀ PHOSPHORYLATION AND CONTRACTION

## Overview of Signaling Pathways Mediating Contraction

Phosphorylation of Ser¹⁹ on the 20-kDa regulatory light chain of myosin II (MLC₂₀) by Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent myosin light-chain kinase (MLCK) is essential for activation of actin-activated myosin ATPase and interaction of actin and myosin, which initiates smooth muscle contraction (41, 42) (Figure 1). The [Ca²⁺]i transient responsible for the initial contraction is rapidly and efficiently dissipated by Ca²⁺ extrusion from the cell and uptake into sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ stores. This causes an equally rapid decline in MLCK activity, which is intensified by phosphorylation of MLCK via Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and p21-activated protein kinase 1 (PAK1) (Figure 1) (20, 43, 44). The decline in Ca²⁺ mobilization reflects the transient natures of PLC-β activity in circular smooth muscle and of cPLA₂ activity in longitudinal smooth muscle. Despite the declines in [Ca²⁺]i and MLCK activity, MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and muscle contraction are relatively well maintained. This pattern led to a search for an alternative process that was postulated to sensitize a Ca²⁺-dependent contraction. It was soon demonstrated that an agonist-mediated, G protein-dependent process augments contractile activity at fixed Ca²⁺ concentrations (45, 46). Subsequent studies, however, showed that contraction does not reflect Ca²⁺ sensitization because complete inhibition of MLC phosphatase activity with microcystin-LR in the absence of Ca²⁺ induces smooth muscle contraction that staurosporine, a nonspecific kinase inhibitor, can suppress (47, 48). Agonist-induced contraction at experimentally fixed Ca²⁺ concentrations involves three elements: agonist-induced activation of a G protein, regulated inhibition of MLC phosphatase, and MLC₂₀ phosphorylation via a Ca²⁺-independent MLCK. The linkage between these elements is evident physiologically in the signaling pathways that regulate the sustained phase of agonist-induced MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and muscle contraction.

## Ca²⁺-Dependent Initial Contraction and MLC₂₀ Phosphorylation

Initial MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction induced by Gq-coupled receptor agonists in circular smooth muscle are mediated by Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent MLCK and are blocked by Gαq or PLC-β1 antibodies in permeabilized muscle cells and by expression of a Gαq C-terminal minigene in intact muscle cells. By contrast, MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction induced by Gi-coupled receptor agonists are blocked by Gβ or PLC-β3 antibodies in permeabilized muscle cells and by expression of the Gαi C-terminal minigene in intact muscle cells (13, 17,

20, 33). The pathways for all receptor types converge downstream, so that MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction are blocked by IP₃ receptor inhibitors, calmodulin antagonists, MLCK inhibitors, and depletion of sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺ stores (49).

Because of their obligatory dependence on an initial step involving arachidonic acid-mediated Ca²⁺ influx, MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction in longitudinal smooth muscle are blocked by voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channel blockers and inhibitors of cPLA₂, calmodulin, and MLCK (49).

# Ca²⁺-Independent Sustained Contraction and MLC₂₀ Phosphorylation

A critical difference between initial and sustained smooth muscle contraction is the balance between MLCK and MLC phosphatase activities. Although Ca²⁺-independent MLCK(s) are much less potent than Ca²⁺-activated MLCK(s), the former appear to derive their effectiveness from the concurrent inhibition of MLC phosphatase during the sustained phase of contraction (47, 48). The pathways that lead to inhibition of MLC phosphatase by Gq/13-coupled receptors are initiated by sequential activation of Gaq/α₁₃, RhoGEF, and RhoA and involve Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylation of the regulatory subunit of MLC phosphatase, MYPT1, and/or PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17, an endogenous inhibitor of MLC phosphatase (20, 41, 50–54). Sustained MLC₂₀ phosphorylation is induced by a Ca²⁺-independent kinase, most likely zipper-interacting protein (ZIP) kinase (47, 55–58) (Figure 2). The pathways initiated by Gi-coupled receptors involve sequential activation of Gβγᵢ, PI 3-kinase, and integrin-linked kinase (ILK); the last of these phosphorylates MLC₂₀ directly and indirectly inhibits MLC phosphatase by phosphorylating CPI-17 (PKC-potentiated 17-kDa protein) (59).

## G PROTEIN-MEDIATED ACTIVATION OF RHOA AND RHO KINASE

Agonists that activate Gq also activate G₁₃; both G proteins are capable of activating RhoA, but their involvement in smooth muscle of the gut is receptor-specific. Muscarinic m3 and CCK-A receptors activate RhoA via Ga₁₃ only, whereas S1P₂ and motilin receptors activate RhoA via both Gaq and Ga₁₃ (13, 17, 20, 29) (Table 1). RhoA, in contrast to other RhoA family G proteins such as Cdc42 and Rac1, is inactivated via ADP ribosylation by the *C. botulinum* C3 exoenzyme (60–61). The inactive form of RhoA (RhoA.GDP) is present in the cytosol bound to a guanine dissociation inhibitor (GDI). Activation of RhoA by Gaq and/or Ga₁₃ is mediated by various Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors (RhoGEFs), which promote the exchange of GDP for GTP. The RhoGEF family of proteins includes p115RhoGEF, PDZ-RhoGEF, and LARG (leukemia-associated RhoGEF). These proteins share common structural motifs that include RGS (regulator of G protein signaling), Dbl homology (DH), and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains (60–61). The DH domain is responsible for the exchange of GDP for GTP. In the GTP-bound conformation, RhoA interacts with and stimulates the activity of downstream effectors including Rho kinase and PLD (29, 62).

Sustained MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation and muscle contraction are initiated by G<sub>q/13</sub>-dependent activation of RhoA via RhoGEFs. Translocation of activated RhoA to the membrane initiates two pathways involving Rho kinase (ROCK) and PKC, respectively. PKC is activated by PLD via dephosphorylation of the primary product of PLD, phosphatidic acid (PA), to DAG. Both pathways result in inhibition of MLC phosphatase. ROCK phosphorylates the regulatory MYPT1 at Thr<sup>696</sup>, causing its dissociation from and inhibition of the catalytic subunit of MLC phosphatase (PPIcδ). PKC phosphorylates an endogenous inhibitor of MLC phosphatase, CPI-17, at Thr<sup>38</sup>, greatly enhancing its ability to inhibit MLC phosphatase activity. MLC<sub>20</sub> is phosphorylated by ZIP kinase (ZIPK), a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent MLCK associated with MYPT1. Sustained MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation reflects the activity of ZIPK and concurrent inhibition of MLC phosphatase. Some receptors (e.g., m3) are coupled to RhoA via G<sub>13</sub> only, whereas others (e.g., SIP<sub>2</sub>, motilin) are coupled to RhoA via both G<sub>q</sub> and G<sub>13</sub> (Table 1). G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors initiate a distinct pathway involving sequential activation of Gβγ<sub>1</sub>, PI 3-kinase, and ILK (not shown); the latter acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent MLCK and inhibits MLC phosphatase by phosphorylating CPI-17 at Thr<sup>38</sup>.

The Rho kinases, ROCK I and ROCK II, the latter of which is predominantly expressed in smooth muscle, belong to a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that includes myotonic dystrophy protein kinase (DMP kinase), Cdc42-binding kinase, and citron kinase (61). All of these kinases possess an NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase domain, a coiled-coil region, and other functional motifs at the COOH terminus. In the inactive form, the PH and Rho-binding domains of Rho kinase bind to the

catalytic NH₂-terminal region, forming an autoinhibitory loop. Activated RhoA (RhoA.GTP) binds to the Rho-binding domain, causing the enzyme to unfold and freeing its catalytic activity (61).

INHIBITION OF MLC PHOSPHATASE VIA RHO KINASE-MEDIATED PHOSPHORYLATION OF MYPT1 Rho kinase phosphorylates the regulatory subunit of MLC phosphatase and inhibits catalytic activity (50, 51). The holoenzyme is a heterotrimer with (a) a 110- to 130-kDa regulatory subunit [myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1)] that is widely expressed and is present in high concentrations in smooth muscle, (b) a 37-kDa catalytic subunit of type 1 phosphatase (PP1cδ), and (c) a 20-kDa subunit of unknown function (51). MYPT1 contains a PP1c-binding motif (K/R-I/V-X-F/W) adjacent to seven NH₂-terminal ankyrin repeats. Interaction of PP1cδ with MYPT1 alters substrate specificity and enhances catalytic activity. Phosphorylation of Thr⁶⁹⁶ in MYPT1 by Rho kinase or by ZIP kinase (which is bound to MYPT1 and is also known as MYPT1-associated kinase) fosters dissociation and inhibits activity of the catalytic subunit (Figure 2) (50, 51, 63–65). Phosphorylation of an adjacent Ser⁶⁹⁵ by cAMP- or cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA and PKG, respectively) blocks the ability of Rho kinase to phosphorylate Thr⁶⁹⁶ and is one of several mechanisms by which PKA and PKG restore MLC phosphatase activity (66). Phosphorylation of Thr⁸⁵³ by Rho kinase has also been reported, but its functional significance remains uncertain.

INHIBITION OF MLC PHOSPHATASE VIA PKC-MEDIATED PHOSPHORYLATION OF CPI-17 PLD, like Rho kinase, is activated downstream of RhoA. As noted above, dephosphorylation of phosphatidic acid, the primary product of phosphatidylcholine hydrolysis by PLD, yields DAG, leading to sustained activation of PKC (Figure 2). The involvement of PKC in sustained, but not initial, contraction and MLC₂₀ phosphorylation has been amply demonstrated and reflects inhibition of MLC phosphatase via a Rho-dependent, PKC-mediated pathway (i.e., CPI-17) distinct from that involving Rho kinase and MYPT1 (49, 52–54). Sustained contraction and MLC₂₀ phosphorylation are blocked by PKC inhibitors (e.g., bisindolylmaleimide or calphostin C) (20, 49). The involvement of PKC isoforms appears to be receptor-specific, with PKC-δ and PKC-ε mediating the effects of G protein-coupled receptor agonists and PKC-α mediating the effects of growth factors and phorbol esters (49, 67).

The target of PKC is CPI-17, an endogenous phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor of the catalytic PP1cδ subunit of MLC phosphatase. CPI-17 is preferentially expressed in vascular and visceral smooth muscle, whereas its orthologue, phosphatase holoenzyme inhibitor (PHI)-1, is more widely expressed (52–54, 68). CPI-17 and PHI-1 are the only endogenous PP1c inhibitors regulated by PKC. The mechanism of inhibition reflects a large increase (~1000-fold) in the binding affinities of CPI-17 and PHI-1 to PP1cδ following PKC-mediated phosphorylation of CPI-17 at Thr³⁸ or of PHI-1 at Thr⁵⁷ (52–54, 68). Several kinases, including Rho kinase, protein kinase N, PAK1, and ILK, phosphorylate CPI-17 at Thr³⁸

in vitro (64, 69, 70). Of these, only Rho kinase has been shown to participate in CPI-17 phosphorylation in vivo (20, 67, 71). For example, CPI-17 phosphorylation at Thr³⁸ in response to acetylcholine or histamine is abolished by PKC inhibitors and partially inhibited by Rho kinase inhibitors (20, 67). Phosphorylation of CPI-17 in response to contractile agonists is correlated with sustained MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and muscle contraction (52–54). Relaxant agonists inhibit CPI-17 phosphorylation at Thr³⁸; the mechanism has not been determined but may reflect suppression of sustained PKC activity via inhibitory phosphorylation of RhoA at Ser¹⁸⁸ by PKA or PKG (72–74). As noted below, CPI-17 can be dephosphorylated via PP2A and PP2C but is a poor substrate for dephosphorylation by PP1 (75).

RECEPTOR-SPECIFIC INVOLVEMENT OF CPI-17 AND MYPT1 IN INHIBITION OF MLC PHOSPHATASE Although both pathways (Rho kinase/MYPT1 and PKC/CPI-17) are downstream of RhoA, their relative involvements in inhibition of MLC phosphatase appear to be receptor-specific. Most Gq/13-coupled receptors (e.g., m3, S1P₂, motilin) engage both pathways, whereas ETA receptors engage only Rho kinase/MYPT1 and LPA₃ receptors engage only PKC/CPI-17 (12, 13, 17, 18). The initial response to endothelin is mediated by both ETA and ETB receptors, whereas the sustained response is mediated only by ETA receptors and reflects Rho kinase-mediated phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr⁶⁹⁶ (12). Although PKC is activated by endothelin, CPI-17 is not phosphorylated and thus does not contribute to inhibition of MLC phosphatase. The absence of CPI-17 phosphorylation by PKC reflects active dephosphorylation of CPI-17 by PP2A via a pathway involving ETB-dependent sequential activation of p38 MAP kinase and PP2A (12, 76). ETA-induced PKC-dependent phosphorylation of CPI-17 can be unmasked by blocking either p38 MAP kinase or PP2A activity.

MLC₂₀ Phosphorylation by Ca²⁺-Independent MLCKs

Agonist-mediated sustained MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction are not affected by inhibitors of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent MLCK, implying that MLC₂₀ phosphorylation during this phase may be mediated by a Ca²⁺-independent MLCK (20, 47, 48). The complete suppression of MLC phosphatase activity during this phase by itself cannot account for MLC₂₀ phosphorylation. As noted above, contraction of arterial smooth muscle induced by the phosphatase inhibitor microcystin-LR in Ca²⁺-free medium is abolished by the nonspecific kinase inhibitor staurosporine, implying the participation of a Ca²⁺-independent kinase (57). Diphosphorylation of MLC₂₀ at both Ser¹⁹ and Thr¹⁸ by a Ca²⁺-independent MLCK is a characteristic feature of MLC₂₀ phosphorylation during agonist-mediated sustained contraction and under conditions designed to elicit Ca²⁺ sensitization (41, 47, 48, 77–79).

ZIPPER-INTERACTING PROTEIN KINASE The search for a Ca²⁺-independent kinase led to the discovery of ZIP kinase. Addition of the purified form of this enzyme

to permeabilized arterial smooth muscle in the absence of Ca²⁺ or phosphatase inhibitors causes contraction and MLC₂₀ phosphorylation at both Ser¹⁹ and Thr¹⁸ (47, 55, 57). ZIP kinase, a serine/threonine kinase expressed in various tissues including smooth muscle, is a member of the death-associated protein (DAP) kinase family, which includes DAP kinase and DAP kinase–related protein 1 (80). ZIP kinase cloned from rat aorta is homologous (49%) to smooth muscle Ca²⁺-dependent MLCK, but unlike MLCK, it has neither an autoinhibitory nor a calmodulin-binding region (55). In intestinal smooth muscle, purified ZIP kinase phosphorylates MYPT1 at Thr⁶⁹⁶, and its potency in vitro (Kₘ = 3 μM) is greater than its potency in phosphorylating MLC₂₀ (Kₘ = 53 μM), suggesting that MYPT1 may be the preferred substrate (65). ZIP kinase is also more effective than Rho kinase in phosphorylating full-length MYPT1 and is insensitive to inhibition by the Rho kinase inhibitor Y27632 (57). Recent evidence suggests that ZIP kinase can also phosphorylate CPI-17 at Thr³⁸ in vitro (64).

The pattern of ZIP kinase activities suggests that in addition to its role in the ultimate phosphorylation of MLC₂₀, ZIP kinase may mediate Rho kinase–dependent phosphorylation of MYPT1 and inhibition of MLC phosphatase. That Rho kinase does not phosphorylate ZIP kinase in vitro suggests that phosphorylation of ZIP kinase by Rho kinase may be indirect via one or more kinases. ZIP kinase is activated by contractile agonists and is subject to both autophosphorylation and phosphorylation by DAP kinase at six COOH-terminal sites (57, 81). Activated plasma membrane-bound Rho kinase may be linked to MYPT1 via myofilament-bound ZIP kinase. The functional linkage between Rho kinase, ZIP kinase, and MYPT1 is supported by recent studies in HEK 293 cells in which expression of constitutively active RhoA increases the association of ZIP kinase and MYPT1 (55).

INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE A distinct Ca²⁺-independent MLCK mediates sustained MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction mediated by Gᵢ-coupled receptors (59). These receptors are not coupled to G₁₃ or RhoA and do not activate Rho kinase or PKC in smooth muscle of the gut (30). Instead, they activate PI 3-kinase via Gβγᵢ and various pathways downstream of PI 3-kinase. As noted above, one pathway involves sequential activation of Cdc42/Rac1, PAK1, and p38 MAP kinase; another involves activation of c-Src; and a third involves PIP₃-dependent activation of ILK (32, 59). ILK, a serine/threonine kinase, was first discovered as a protein bound to the cytoplasmic domain of integrin β subunits and involved in cytoskeletal regulation via interaction with actin-binding proteins. Walsh and coworkers (48, 78) recently isolated a cellular fraction of ILK bound to myofilaments and identified ILK as a Ca²⁺-independent MLCK.

In addition to phosphorylating MLC₂₀, ILK phosphorylates CPI-17 at Thr³⁸ and PHI-1 at Thr⁵⁷ (68). CPI-17 and PHI-1 thio-phosphorylated by ILK inhibit MLC phosphatase activity in vitro and induce contraction at subthreshold concentrations of Ca²⁺ upon being added to permeabilized rat arterial smooth muscle. Recent studies show that ILK is associated with the MLC phosphatase holoenzyme
and phosphorylates MYPT1 at three sites, including functionally active Thr<sup>695</sup>, in the chicken gizzard (82). Phosphorylation of MYPT1 by ILK in vitro produces only moderate inhibition of MLC phosphatase in comparison with phosphorylation by Rho kinase; the functional significance of ILK in this context is uncertain. Thus, ILK, like ZIP kinase, can induce smooth muscle contraction by direct phosphorylation of MLC<sub>20</sub> combined with CPI-17-dependent inhibition of MLC phosphatase.

Recent studies on intestinal smooth muscle cells have shown that three G<sub>i</sub>-coupled receptors (G<sub>i1</sub>-coupled sstr<sub>3</sub>, G<sub>i2</sub>-coupled δ-opioid, and G<sub>i3</sub>-coupled adenosine A<sub>1</sub> receptors) initiate contraction by activating PLC-β3 and induce sustained contraction and MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation via preferential activation of a PI 3-kinase/ILK pathway (59). Both MLC<sub>20</sub> and CPI-17 (but not MYPT1) are phosphorylated, and both phosphorylations are inhibited by the PI 3-kinase inhibitor, LY-294002, and by expression of dominant-negative ILK(R211A) or siRNA for ILK, providing a clear demonstration of the role of ILK as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent MLCK and inhibitor of MLC phosphatase in vivo.

In contrast to sstr<sub>3</sub>, δ-opioid, and A<sub>1</sub> receptors, G<sub>i3</sub>-coupled m2 receptors do not induce sustained contraction and preferentially activate Cdc42/Rac1, PAK1, and p38 MAP kinase (32). The last inhibits ILK activity and prevents ILK-induced sustained contraction and MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation; inhibition of p38 MAP kinase restores contraction and MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation (K.S. Murthy, unpublished observations). Thus, activation of PAK1 and p38 MAP kinase by m2 receptors prevents activation of MLCK and ILK during the initial and sustained phases of contraction, respectively.

# Distinctive Features of Sustained MLC<sub>20</sub> Phosphorylation

The temporal shift from Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MLCK to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent MLCK (ZIP kinase, ILK) is accompanied by a spatial shift of MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation from a central to a peripheral location in smooth muscle cells (83). Centrally located MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation monitored immunohistochemically with a Ser<sup>19</sup> antibody is susceptible to inhibition by ML-9. By contrast, the more sustained, peripherally located MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation is inhibited by Y27632 and upon expression of RhoA (T-19N) (83). As noted above, MLC<sub>20</sub> is predominantly monophosphorylated at Ser<sup>19</sup> by MLCK but diphosphorylated with equal affinity at Ser<sup>19</sup> and Thr<sup>18</sup> by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent MLCKs. In comparison with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent MLCK, both ZIP kinase and ILK are only moderately active, and their effectiveness in maintaining MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation appears to depend largely on RhoA-dependent mechanisms for concomitant inhibition of MLC phosphatase.

# Distinctive Signaling in Esophageal Smooth Muscle

Although the focus of this review is on gastric and intestinal smooth muscle, signaling for contraction in esophageal smooth muscle deserves mention because of its distinctive aspects (2, 84–87). Contraction and MLC<sub>20</sub> phosphorylation in
muscle cells of the lower esophageal sphincter by acetylcholine are mediated by m3 receptors and involve the same mechanisms described above for gastric and intestinal circular smooth muscle cells. By contrast, contraction by acetylcholine of smooth muscle cells derived from the normally relaxed esophageal body is mediated by Gi-coupled m2 receptors, is dependent upon Ca²⁺ influx and activation of PKC-ε, and is not affected by calmodulin antagonists or MLCK inhibitors. Recent studies suggest that two MAP kinase pathways downstream of PKC-ε, involving ZIP kinase and ILK, mediate contraction in these muscle cells (87).

# DESENSITIZATION OF RECEPTOR FUNCTION IN SMOOTH MUSCLE

G protein–coupled receptor signaling in smooth muscle of the gut is rapidly attenuated or terminated by mechanisms that target receptors, G proteins, or effector enzymes. The mechanisms include (a) receptor phosphorylation by G protein– coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) or second messenger–activated kinases (e.g., PKA or PKC), (b) inactivation of Ga.GTP via RGS proteins, and (c) phosphorylation of specific G proteins (i.e., Ga₁₁ and Ga₁₂) and transient sequestration of activated Ga proteins in caveolae.

## GRK-Mediated Receptor Desensitization

Homologous desensitization of agonist-occupied receptors is initiated by GRK-mediated phosphorylation of the receptors and binding of β-arrestin, which uncouples the receptors from the G protein as a prelude to receptor internalization (88–90). β-arrestin targets the phosphorylated receptor to clathrin-coated pits and acts as a scaffold for other proteins, including the terminal components of JNK/ERK/MAP kinase cascade and the cytosolic tyrosine kinase c-Src. The latter stimulates tyrosine phosphorylation of the large GTPase dynamin and promotes its ability to cleave the clathrin-coated vesicles from the cell surface. The vesicles fuse with endosomes, within which the receptors are dephosphorylated and either slowly or rapidly recycled to the surface (88). In smooth muscle of the gut, δ-opioid and m2 receptors are phosphorylated by Gβγ-dependent GRK2, and cannabinoid CB₁ receptors by Gβγ-independent GRK5 (91–92).

## G Protein Deactivation by RGS Proteins

RGS proteins contain a conserved 120-amino acid RGS domain that binds exclusively to activated Ga subunits (Ga.GTP) and terminates G protein signaling by accelerating intrinsic Ga.GTPase activity (~1000-fold), thereby fostering reassociation of the Gaβγ trimer (93). Several RGS categories have been identified on the basis of additional structures outside the RGS domain. Seven out of 25 known RGS proteins (RGS3, -4, -6, -8, -10, -12, and -16) have now been identified in smooth muscle cells of the gut (J. Huang & K.S. Murthy, unpublished)

observations). Gαq activated by m3 or motilin receptors is regulated by RGS4, whereas Gi2 activated by CB1 receptors is regulated by RGS6 (94, 95). RGS6, the only member of the R7 category of RGS proteins expressed in smooth muscle of the gut, contains a Gγ-like domain that binds to Gβ5 and Gαi2 to constitute an atypical G protein. Unlike classical Gβγ, the Gβ5.RGS6 complex is incapable of activating Gβγ-dependent downstream effectors, such as PLC-β3 (21, 22, 95).

**G Protein–Dependent Desensitization: Gαi1/2 Phosphorylation and Caveolar Sequestration**

Phosphorylation of Gαi1 and Gαi2 (but not Gαi3) by PKC limits the ability of these proteins to transduce signals. Phosphorylation appears to decrease the affinity of Gα for Gβγ, impeding reassociation of the subunits. In smooth muscle of the gut, activation of PKC with contractile agonists such as CCK induces phosphorylation of Gαi1 and Gαi2 and blocks inhibition of adenylyl cyclase V/VI (96). Blockade of PKC activity abolishes phosphorylation of Gαi1/2 and restores their ability to inhibit adenylyl cyclase (96). Thus, phosphorylation of Gαi1 and Gαi2 by PKC derived from activation of Gαq-coupled receptors contributes to heterologous desensitization.

Gα proteins contain caveolin-binding motifs consisting of 10–15-amino acid sequences with characteristically spaced aromatic residues (97). These sequences bind to caveolin-3 expressed in smooth muscle of the gut (98). Receptor activation results in the transient binding of activated Gα subunits by caveolin-3. This transient sequestration of Gα.GTP in caveolae hinders reassociation of Gα and Gβγ and impedes the response mediated by a different receptor coupled to the same G protein. G protein sequestration peaks in 5–10 min and disappears within 30 min (98). The binding of Gα subunits to caveolin-3 can be selectively blocked by caveolin-binding peptide fragments.

**SIGNALING FOR RELAXATION IN SMOOTH MUSCLE OF THE GUT**

Smooth muscle contraction is terminated spontaneously by mechanisms that target receptors or G proteins, or more directly by exposure to relaxant agonists. The mechanisms initiated by these agonists eventually converge to dephosphorylate MLC20 and thus may target one or more steps in the signaling pathways that mediate initial or sustained MLC20 phosphorylation. These targets are outlined below in more detail.

**Relaxant Neurotransmitters and their Messengers in the Gut**

Relaxation of smooth muscle in the gut reflects a unique interplay between neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) and the peptide neurotransmitters vasoactive intestinal

peptide (VIP) and its homologue, pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating peptide (PACAP), which possesses identical properties in smooth muscle (only VIP is referred to below). NO formed in nerve terminals by nNOS regulates VIP release; in turn, VIP stimulates smooth muscle eNOS (nitric oxide synthase III) to generate NO. NO derived from both nerves and smooth muscle cells stimulates soluble guanylyl cyclase activity and cGMP formation (99–104). In addition, VIP interacts with VPAC₂ receptors to stimulate adenylate cyclase activity and cAMP formation (103). Thus, concurrent generation of cAMP and cGMP and activation of PKA and PKG are the physiological norm. This fact has considerable bearing on the regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels, on cyclase and phosphodiesterase (PDE) activities, and on the activities of both PKA and PKG. PKA and/or PKG act upstream to induce feedback desensitization of the receptors, inhibition of adenylate and guanylate cyclase activities, and stimulation of cAMP-specific PDE3 and PDE4 and cGMP-specific PDE5 activities (105–107) (Figure 3). The kinases also act downstream to induce relaxation by inhibiting Ca²⁺ mobilization, MLC₂₀ phosphorylation, and various targets that lead to inhibition of MLC phosphatase and sustained phosphorylation of MLC₂₀ (Figure 4).

## Receptors and G Proteins Mediating Relaxation

Three types of G protein–coupled receptors for VIP and PACAP have been identified: VPAC₁ and VPAC₂ receptors, which possess equally high affinity for VIP and PACAP, and PAC₁ receptors, which possess high affinity for PACAP and very low affinity for VIP (108). A recently cloned VIP-specific receptor has been identified in smooth muscle cells of guinea pig tenia coli; it differs from VPAC₂ receptors in the guinea pig stomach by only two amino acid residues (Phe⁴⁰/Phe⁴¹ in lieu of Leu⁴⁰/Leu⁴¹) in the ligand-binding NH₂-terminal domain. Mutation of these two residues to Leu⁴⁰/Leu⁴¹ so as to mimic the gastric VPAC₂ receptor restores equal affinity for VIP and PACAP (109, 110).

Smooth muscle cells of the gut express predominantly VPAC₂ receptors (103). The receptors are coupled via Gₛ to activation of adenylate cyclase V/VI. In addition, VIP interacts with a single-transmembrane natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) coupled via Gαᵢ₁/Gαᵢ₂, sequentially resulting in stimulation of Ca²⁺ influx, activation of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent eNOS, NO formation, and NO-mediated activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase and PKG (111). Radioligand binding studies using [¹²⁵I]ANP and [¹²⁵I]VIP confirmed that VIP interacts with both VPAC₂ and NPR-C (Figure 3). Heterologous expression of NPR-C in COS-1 cells provided decisive evidence that VIP interacts with NPR-C (112).

Unlike NPR-A and NPR-B, the intracellular domain of NPR-C is devoid of guanylyl cyclase or kinase activity and consists of 37 amino acids. A 17-amino acid sequence in the middle region of this domain is capable of selectively activating Gᵢ₁ and Gᵢ₂ (113). The G protein–activating region was identified using synthetic peptide sequences corresponding to various regions of the intracellular domain, and the results were confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the cloned receptor

VIP/PACAP

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 3 Dual signaling pathways initiated by the relaxant neuropeptides VIP and PACAP and feedback inhibition by PKA and PKG. VIP and its homologue PACAP activate cognate seven-transmembrane VPAC₂ receptors coupled via Gₛ to adenylyl cyclase V/VI, leading to cAMP generation and PKA activation. They also activate a single-transmembrane natriuretic peptide receptor C (NPR-C) coupled via Gα₁₁ and Gα₁₂ to Ca²⁺ influx and Ca²⁺/calmodulin activation of NOS III expressed in smooth muscle cells. This leads to NO-dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) and cGMP-dependent activation of PKG. Activation of Gα₁₁/₁₂ is mediated by a 17-amino acid sequence in the middle region of NPR-C. In the presence of cGMP, PKG also becomes highly sensitive to cAMP stimulation. Both PKA and PKG act separately upstream to desensitize VPAC₂ and NPR-C receptors, inhibiting adenylyl cyclase and soluble guanylyl cyclase, and activating cAMP-specific PDE3A and PDE4 and cGMP-specific PDE5. Stimulation, (+); inhibition, (−).

(114, 115). The active sequence possessed two NH₂-terminal Arg-Arg residues and the COOH-terminal motif His-Arg-Glu-Leu-Arg. Similar sequences have been identified in other single- and seven-transmembrane receptors (e.g., IGF-II and adrenoceptors α₁b and α₂) (116, 117).

VPAC₂ receptors in smooth muscle are internalized and desensitized via GRK2. PKA accelerates this process via feedback phosphorylation of GRK2 (118). A single Thr⁴⁶⁶ residue in the intracellular domain of NPR-C, located outside the G protein-activating sequence, is selectively phosphorylated by PKG, resulting in feedback desensitization of NPR-C (119).

Figure 4 Molecular targets of PKA and PKG during relaxation of smooth muscle. PKG or both PKG and PKA induce relaxation by targeting components of the contractile signaling pathways and inducing dephosphorylation of MLC₂₀. Both kinases phosphorylate RGS4 and stimulate deactivation of Gαq, leading to inhibition of PLC-β1 activity and of IP₃ formation. In addition, PKG, but not PKA, phosphorylates IP₃R-I and the sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺/ATPase pump, thereby inhibiting Ca²⁺ release and stimulating Ca²⁺ reuptake. Both kinases inhibit Ca²⁺ mobilization in longitudinal muscle by inhibiting cPLA₂ activity and ryanodine receptors (not shown). All of these mechanisms act to reduce [Ca²⁺]i and thus inhibit MLCK activity and initial MLC₂₀ phosphorylation and contraction. Both PKA and PKG inactivate RhoA by phosphorylating activated RhoA at Ser¹⁸⁸ and translocating it to the cytosol. Further downstream, both kinases can phosphorylate Ser⁶⁹⁵ of MYPT1, thereby precluding phosphorylation of adjacent Thr⁶⁹⁶ by Rho kinase (ROCK). A PKG-specific mechanism reflecting interaction of leucine-zipper domains of PKG-Iα and MYPT1 has also been shown to stimulate dephosphorylation of MLC₂₀. A RhoA-independent mechanism involves stimulatory phosphorylation of telokin, an endogenous activator of MLC phosphatase, by both PKA and PKG. Stimulation, (+); inhibition, (-); red arrows, targets of both PKA and PKG; green arrows, targets of PKG only.

Regulation of cAMP and cGMP Levels

cAMP and cGMP depend on the rates of their synthesis by cyclases and degradation by PDEs (107, 120, 121). The activity of these enzymes is regulated via feedback by PKA and PKG. In smooth muscle of the gut, cAMP levels are regulated by PKA via stimulatory phosphorylation of PDE3A and PDE4D5, the predominant

PDE4 isozymes expressed in smooth muscle, and via inhibitory phosphorylation of adenyl cyclase V/VI (105, 106). cGMP levels are regulated via stimulatory phosphorylation of PDE5 by PKG and PKA and via inhibitory phosphorylation of soluble guanylyl cyclase by PKG only (105). cAMP degradation by PDE3A is attenuated in the presence of cGMP, whereas cGMP degradation is augmented in the presence of cAMP as a result of PKA-mediated activation of PDE5.

# Activation of Protein Kinases by cAMP and cGMP

cAMP is produced in ~10-fold greater amounts than cGMP (122). cGMP selectively activates PKG, whereas cAMP selectively activates PKA at low concentrations but can cross-activate PKG at higher concentrations (122–125). Autophosphorylation of PKG in the presence of cGMP greatly augments the affinity of cAMP for PKG (126). Because both cyclic nucleotides are generated concurrently, the greater abundance of cAMP and its higher affinity for PKG in the presence of cGMP render cAMP an important activator of both PKA and PKG.

# Molecular Targets of PKA and PKG

As noted above, PKA and PKG act on upstream targets to regulate cAMP and cGMP levels by desensitizing receptors, inhibiting cyclase activities, and stimulating PDE activities. In addition, both protein kinases act on several downstream targets in the cascades that mediate initial and sustained contraction, resulting in dephosphorylation of MLC₂₀ and relaxation of smooth muscle (Figure 4). Thus, PKG and/or PKA inhibit Ca²⁺ mobilization by (a) inhibiting IP₃ formation in circular smooth muscle and arachidonic acid formation in longitudinal smooth muscle (127–129), (b) inhibiting Ca²⁺ release via PKG-Iα-specific phosphorylation of IP₃ receptor/Ca²⁺ channels in circular muscle and ryanodine receptor/Ca²⁺ channels in longitudinal muscle (36, 130), (c) stimulating Ca²⁺ uptake via PKG-specific phosphorylation of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺/ATPase (SERCA), and stimulating Ca²⁺ efflux via phosphorylation of plasmalemmal Ca²⁺/ATPase (125, 131), and (d) inhibiting Ca²⁺ channel activity and stimulating K⁺ channel activity, thereby reducing Ca²⁺ influx (132). These effects on plasma membrane Ca²⁺ and K⁺ channels lead to membrane hyperpolarization and are relevant only to spontaneously depolarized smooth muscle (e.g., sphincter muscle) or to smooth muscle depolarized by electrical slow waves. All the mechanisms listed above influence Ca²⁺ mobilization and thus operate only during the initial phase of contraction. In addition, PKA and PKG influence sustained muscle contraction by acting directly on two major targets: RhoA and the regulatory subunit of MLC phosphatase (MYPT1) (66, 73, 74, 133, 134). A direct effect on CPI-17 has not been demonstrated.

# Relaxation of Initial Ca²⁺-Dependent Contraction

INHIBITION OF IP₃ FORMATION AND IP₃-DEPENDENT CA²⁺ RELEASE IN CIRCULAR SMOOTH MUSCLE Both PKA and PKG inhibit Gαq-dependent PLC-β1 activity
and IP₃ formation. However, PKA and PKG do not directly phosphorylate Gαq or PLC-β1. Rather, PLC-β1 activity indirectly is decreased via stimulatory phosphorylation of RGS4 by PKA and PKG (and of the RGS domain of GRK2 by PKA only) (129). This phosphorylation of RGS4 and GRK2 increases their binding to and rapidly inactivates Gαq, leading to inhibition of both PLC-β1 activity and IP₃ formation.

In addition, PKG-Iα, one of two PKG isoforms expressed in smooth muscle of the gut—but not PKA—phosphorylates IP₃R-I, the only IP₃ receptor type mediating Ca²⁺ release in smooth muscle of the gut, resulting in inhibition of Ca²⁺ release (36). In circular smooth muscle, agonists that activate only PKA inhibit Ca²⁺ release by inhibiting IP₃ formation, whereas agonists that activate only PKG inhibit Ca²⁺ release by both inhibiting IP₃ formation and inactivating IP₃ receptors/Ca²⁺ channels. When both PKA and PKG are activated concurrently (see above), Ca²⁺ release is inhibited via both mechanisms.

INHIBITION OF ARACHIDONIC ACID FORMATION AND CA²⁺/CADP RIBOSE–INDUCED CA²⁺ RELEASE IN LONGITUDINAL MUSCLE In longitudinal smooth muscle, both PKA and PKG phosphorylate cPLA₂ and inhibit arachidonic acid formation, leading to a decrease in Ca²⁺ influx (128). PKG selectively inhibits arachidonic acid–mediated Ca²⁺ influx. This inhibition of Ca²⁺ influx leads to a decrease in both cyclic ADP ribose formation and cyclic ADP ribose– and Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release via ryanodine receptors/Ca²⁺ channels.

Thus, during the initial phase of contraction, relaxation via PKA or PKG results from a decrease in [Ca²⁺]i, leading to inhibition of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent MLCK activity and MLC₂₀ phosphorylation. There is no evidence that either PKA or PKG inhibit MLCK activity directly in vivo.

# Relaxation of Sustained Ca²⁺-Independent Contraction

PKA and PKG can induce relaxation of sustained contraction by acting on one or more targets in the G₁₃/RhoA pathway, including G₁₃, p115RhoGEF, and RhoA, as well as targets downstream of RhoA such as Rho kinase, PKC, MYPT1, and CPI-17. PKA inhibits RhoA activity in platelets by phosphorylating Thr²⁰³ in Gα₁₃, but this effect has not been determined in smooth muscle (135, 136). Both PKA and PKG can phosphorylate activated membrane-bound RhoA at Ser¹⁸⁸ (73, 74). Phosphorylation of RhoA stimulates its translocation back to the cytosol and inhibits the activity of Rho-dependent, membrane-bound targets, such as Rho kinase and PLD (73). Inhibition of Rho kinase blocks phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr⁶⁹⁶, whereas inhibition of PLD leads to decrease in DAG formation and in PKC activity and PKC-mediated CPI-17 phosphorylation at Thr³⁸. Thus, RhoA phosphorylation by PKA and PKG blocks the two Rho-dependent pathways that mediate inhibition of MLC phosphatase. The resultant increase in MLC phosphatase activity leads to dephosphorylation of MLC₂₀ and relaxation of sustainedmuscle contraction (Figure 4). Although several potential mechanisms may mediate relaxation of sustained muscle contraction (as described below), the location of RhoA at the inception of the signaling pathway suggests that inactivation of RhoA via PKA and/or PKG-mediated phosphorylation is the predominant mechanism for relaxation.

MYPT1 has been identified in recent studies as a target of PKA and/or PKG. Both kinases directly phosphorylate MYPT1 in vitro at a site (Ser⁶⁹⁵) adjacent to the active site (Thr⁶⁹⁶) (66). Phosphorylation of Ser⁶⁹⁵ by PKA or PKG prevents MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr⁶⁹⁶ via Rho kinase, thereby blocking Rho kinase–dependent inhibition of MLC phosphatase activity (Figure 4). This mechanism has yet to be demonstrated in vivo. A distinct PKG-specific mechanism involves binding of the NH₂-terminal leucine-zipper domain of PKG-Iα to the COOH-terminal leucine-zipper domain of MYPT1. Blockade of this interaction in vascular smooth muscle prevents MLC₂₀ dephosphorylation, implying that PKG can activate MLC phosphatase by binding to MYPT1 (133, 134). Relaxation of vascular smooth muscle via this mechanism appears to depend upon expression of MYPT1 isoforms with leucine-zipper motifs (137). Expression of these isoforms, which is tissue-specific, has not been determined in smooth muscle of the gut.

A distinct mechanism for muscle relaxation that targets MLC phosphatase but is not downstream of RhoA signaling involves telokin, an endogenous 17-kDa activator of MLC phosphatase (138–140) (Figure 4). The sequence of telokin is identical to the COOH-terminal 155-amino acid residues of MLCK but is expressed independently of it. Its expression is low in tonic smooth muscle; it is about five times higher in phasic smooth muscle (e.g., intestinal longitudinal muscle). The ability of telokin to stimulate MLC phosphatase is moderately enhanced upon phosphorylation of Ser¹³ by PKA or PKG (139). Telokin may be viewed as a counterpart to CPI-17, whose ability to inhibit MLC phosphatase activity is low but is greatly enhanced upon phosphorylation by PKC. Re-addition of telokin to permeabilized ileal longitudinal muscle strips inhibits Ca²⁺-induced contraction and MLC₂₀ phosphorylation; this effect is enhanced by 8-Br-cGMP (138). Addition of a phosphorylation site–deficient mutant of telokin has equivalent potency as a relaxant agent, but its effect is not enhanced by 8-Br-cGMP (140). The functional contribution of telokin to relaxation of sustained Ca²⁺-independent contraction and MLC₂₀ dephosphorylation has not been determined.

In summary, mechanisms of relaxation involving PKA and PKG converge on dephosphorylation of MLC₂₀. Relaxation of the initial Ca²⁺-dependent contraction reflects inhibition of the Ca²⁺-mobilizing messengers, IP₃ in circular muscle and arachidonic acid in longitudinal muscle, by PKA or PKG, accentuated by PKG-specific inactivation of sarcoplasmic IP₃ or ryanodine Ca²⁺ channels. Relaxation of sustained Ca²⁺-independent contraction reflects inactivation of RhoA by PKA and PKG, which may be enhanced by mechanisms that target MLC phosphates, such as MYPT1 phosphorylation by PKA and PKG and PKG-specific MYPT1:PKG-Iα leucine-zipper interaction.
