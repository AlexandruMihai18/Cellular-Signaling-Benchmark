a, Schematic of the Sumatran subduction zones with the overlying plates removed. Calculated three-dimensional stresses, including contributions from both earthquakes resolved directly on to the structures of interest, have been projected on to a diagram of the structural geometry and geography of the region. Here we use a low-value coefficient of effective friction, 0.4, although the main results are robust to large ranges of this value. Grey-scale values on the rupture plane represent the amount of slip in metres experienced on the southernmost 450 km of the Sumatra–Andaman earthquake and on the Simeulue–Nias earthquake. Colour-scale values represent the co-seismic stress change on the Sunda-trench subduction zone and the Sumatra fault. Stress contours are in 2-bar intervals. Red dashed contours indicate zero co-seismic stress. Black star indicates the location of Banda Aceh. b, Locations of ruptures of recent and historical earthquakes on the Sunda trench. Dotted lines indicate approximate extents of historical ruptures (1833, 1861 and 1935); solid lines surrounding dark-blue areas indicate seismological inversions of recent earthquakes; red star, epicentre of December 2004 event; yellow star, epicentre of March 2005 event; black star, Banda Aceh. The rupture area of the 1797 event, which is not shown here, probably overlaps significantly with the 1833 event under Sipura and Pagai Islands and may extend under Siberut Island. The precise extent of this event strongly influences the estimated slip deficit on the megathrust.

submitted) show that the megathrust is slipping aseismically both above and below this narrow patch. The slippage occurs at the rate of plate convergence. Furthermore, the 1935 patch (Fig. 1b) has been slipping during the past century at about half the rate at which the plate is moving. Therefore, accumulated strains and hence stresses on the Batu patch are probably low. The Mentawai segment, on the other hand, presents a greater threat.

Our palaeoseismic investigations (manuscript submitted) show that the megathrust has not ruptured under the island of Siberut (0.7 to 2° S) since 1797. The latest ruptures farther south involved a few metres of slip in 1797 (magnitude > 8; 2.0–3.5° S) and a 10-metre rupture in 1833 (magnitude > 8.5; 2.0–5.5° S). Both of these events produced large tsunamis on the islands and mainland coast. Events similar to 1833 seem to occur every 230 years on average.

These observations, in conjunction with the stress changes mentioned, suggest that the greatest current seismic threat from the Sunda megathrust comes from the Mentawai section, between about 0.7 and 5.5° S. Slip on the northern part of this section could be greater than 10 metres, depending on the timing of the last rupture (based on a convergence rate of 5 cm yr⁻¹). Slip on the southern portion could be as great as in 1833: that is, up to 10 metres. The historical record and the experience of the Sumatra–Andaman and Simeulue–Nias events indicate that a tsunami could be a possibility. The threat of an earthquake of magnitude 7.0–7.5 on the Sumatra fault north of 4° N has not receded.

**PLANT BIOCHEMISTRY**

**Anthocyanin biosynthesis in roses**

Anthocyanin is the principal pigment in flowers, conferring intense red-to-blue cyanic colours on petals and helping to attract pollinators. Its biosynthesis involves glycosylation steps that are important for the stability of the pigment and for its aqueous solubility in vacuoles. Phylogenetic analysis also indicates that this previously unknown glucosyltransferase enzyme may be unique to roses, with glycosylation having apparently evolved into a single stabilizing step in other plants.

Figure 1 | A previously undiscovered rose anthocyanidin glucosyltransferase and its phylogeny. **a**, Comparison of the reaction pathways of anthocyanin glycosylation in the rose and in other plants: the rose glucosyltransferase RhGT1 catalyses two reactions instead of one. 3-GT, glucosyltransferase specific for the hydroxyl group at position 3 on the anthocyanidin molecule. **b**, Molecular phylogenetic tree based on the amino-acid sequences of members of the plant glucosyltransferase superfamily. Sequences were aligned by using the multiple alignment program Clustal W; the tree was constructed by the neighbour-joining method. Numbers indicate bootstrap values greater than 800.

More than 24,000 cultivars of roses have been registered³⁴. Although the flowers come in a wide variety of colours, rose pigments are composed mainly of the structurally simple anthocyanidin 3,5-O-diglucoside (anthocyanin)⁵. However, the process by which anthocyanidin is glycosylated in roses is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the role of glucosyltransferase activity in anthocyanin biosynthesis in rose petals (for methods, see supplementary information).

We isolated glucosyltransferase activity from rose petals and found that it could catalyse glycosylation at not just one but two different sites on the anthocyanidin molecule: glycosylation occurs first at the 5-OH and then at the 3-OH group (Fig. 1a). No new products were detected in reactions in which anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosides were used as glucosyl acceptors. These findings contradict the assumption²⁶⁻⁸ that the stabilization of anthocyanidin occurs by initial glycosylation of the 3-OH residue of anthocyanidin.

This dual glucosyltransferase activity of the crude enzyme fraction was compared with that of a recombinant enzyme produced by cloning its encoding complementary DNA (RhGT1; accession number AB201048; length 1,419 base pairs). The recombinant RhGT1 protein also sequentially catalyses two glycosylation steps at the 5-OH and 3-OH positions (Fig. 1a, top). Like the crude enzyme, RhGT1 can use either unglycosylated anthocyanidin or anthocyanidin 5-O-glucoside as a glucosyl acceptor, but not anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside.

Recombinant 3-glucosyltransferases that glycosylate flavonoids such as anthocyanidin in other plants (as, for example, in the carnation *Dianthus caryophyllus*) do not recognize anthocyanidin 5-O-glucoside as a glucosyl acceptor⁹, and recombinant 5-glucosyltransferases do not glycosylate anthocyanidin⁸,¹⁰. These enzymes evidently differ from the rose enzyme RhGT1, which is a single enzyme that can catalyse glycosylation at two different positions on anthocyanidin. We designate this novel glucosyltransferase as UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 5,3-O-glycosyltransferase, in which uridine diphosphate acts as the glucose carrier. We used northern blotting to test for the presence of RhGT1 RNA in different parts of the rose (see supplementary information) and found that it is temporally and spatially regulated during flower development (results not shown), depending on when and where anthocyanin biosynthesis is activated for cyanic coloration of rose flowers.

Molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1b) reveals that RhGT1 differs significantly from other anthocyanidin 3- and 5-glucosyltransferase subfamily members and that it probably evolved more closely with the glycosylation enzymes of pigments other than anthocyanin or of their secondary metabolites. It is a mystery why this particular glucosyltransferase evolved independently in roses. The novelty of the RhGT1 enzyme therefore lies not only in its ability to catalyse glycosylation at two different sites on the anthocyanidin molecule but also in its apparent absence from other species.

Like cyanidin, anthocyanidin 5-O-glucoside is unstable without the additional glycosylation at its 3-OH residue and so does not exist as a stoichiometric intermediate. In the rose pathway, anthocyanidin 3,5-O-diglucoside is therefore the first stable anthocyanin, whereas this is usually anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside in other plants (Fig. 1a)²,⁶⁻⁸. Anthocyanidin 3,5-O-diglucoside and anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside are therefore responsible for flower coloration in roses and in other plants, respectively. Although many angiosperms produce anthocyanin derivatives from anthocyanidin 3-O-glucoside as a precursor²,⁸, this is evolutionarily precluded in roses by their different glycosylation pattern, which may be unique to members of the Rosaceae.
