Ansamitocins are potent antitumor agents produced by *Actinosynnema pretiosum*. As deduced from their structures, an N-methylation on the amide bond is required among the various modifications. The protein encoded by *asm10* belongs to the SAM-dependent methyltransferase family. Through gene inactivation and complementation, *asm10* was proved to be responsible for the N-methylation of ansamitocins. Asm10 is a 33.0 kDa monomer, as determined by gel filtration. By using N-desmethyl-ansamitocin P-3 as substrate, the optimal temperature and pH for Asm10 catalysis were determined to be 32°C and 10.0, respectively. Asm10 also showed broad substrate flexibility toward other N-desmethyl-ansamycins and synthetic indolin-2-ones. Through site-directed mutagenesis, Asp154 and Leu155 of Asm10 were confirmed to be essential for its catalysis, possibly through the binding of SAM. The characterization of this unique N-methyltransferase has enriched the toolbox for engineering N-methylated derivatives from both natural and synthetic compounds; this will allow known potential drugs to be modified.

## Introduction

Ansamitocins (APs) are highly potent antitumor compounds of microbial origin, produced by *Actinosynnema pretiosum* spp. *auranticum* ATCC 31565. ${}^{[1,2]}$ They belong to the maytansine family and play an antimitotic role by inhibiting microtubule assembly at/or near the vinblastine binding site. ${}^{[3-5]}$ The severe side effects and poor efficacy of ansamitocin P-3 (Figure 1A) has prompted its use as a toxic “warhead” in immunotoxin conjugates; high-affinity binding of the conjugates was observed at microtubule ends and was responsible for the suppression of microtubule dynamic instability. ${}^{[6,7]}$ Several of these conjugates are currently in late-phase clinical trials as therapeutic agents against solid tumors, including HER2+ metastatic breast cancer, multiple myeloma, and prostate cancer. ${}^{[3,8-10]}$ Investigation of the structure–activity relationships revealed that the ester side chain at C-3 and the free hydroxyl group at C-9 play an important role in antitumor activity. Additionally, the epoxide functionality is thought to modify the activity, whereas N-methylation was not found to be essential for activity. ${}^{[11]}$

Analysis of the structures of ansamitocins implies that at least three methylation reactions (on C10, the hydroxyl group of C20, and the nitrogen of the amide bond) are required for their biosynthesis (Figure 1A). The ansamitocin biosynthetic gene clusters were cloned from a cosmid library of *A. pretiosum*, and most of the genes expected to be required for ansamitocin biosynthesis were identified (Figure 1B). ${}^{[12]}$ Gene functions and the order of post-PKS modifications were determined by in vivo gene inactivation, feeding experiments with accumulated compounds, and in vitro enzymatic analysis with purified enzymes. ${}^{[4]}$ Three methyltransferase genes were found in the cluster, *asm7*, *asm10*, and *asm17*. Gene *asm17* was proved to be responsible for the O-methylation in the biosynthesis of methoxymalonyl-ACP extender unit, ${}^{[13]}$ whereas *asm7* was putatively assigned for the O-methylation at the hydroxyl group of C20. ${}^{[4]}$ In silico analysis showed Asm7 belonged to the O-methyltransferase (O-MTs) family 2, and Asm17 belonged to O-MTs family 3. Notably, Asm10 showed very low homology with known N-methyltransferases (N-MTs), and was similar to some S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) dependent O-MTs. Asm10 was suggested to be involved in the methylation of the amide bond as the final step for ansamitocin biosynthesis.

Recently, we isolated a series of novel N-glycosylated ansamitocosides AGP-1, AGP-2, and AGP-3 ${}^{[14,15]}$ from cultures of *A. pretiosum* on solid ISP2 medium, and identified *asm25* as the N-glycosyltransferase gene responsible for the macrolactam N-glycosylation. ${}^{[16]}$ Therefore, both Asm10 and Asm25 are thought to modify the nitrogen of the amide bond, and catalyze the N-methylation and N-glycosylation of N-desmethyl-ansamitocins (PNDs), respectively.

Now, we have proved the involvement of *asm10* in the methylation of the amide bond through gene inactivation and complementation, and characterized the catalytic features of Asm10 with natural or synthetic lactams. Moreover, key amino acid residues of Asm10, possibly for SAM-binding and catalysis, were identified by site-directed mutagenesis.

### Results

#### Asm10 is involved in ansamitocin biosynthesis

To investigate whether Asm10 is involved in ansamitocin biosynthesis, gene *asm10* was inactivated through a KpnI site elimination from 674 to 679 bp (Figure 2A). The resulting mutant strain BLQ12 was confirmed by KpnI digestion of the *asm10* PCR products by using the total genomic DNA as template. On the electrophoretic gel, BLQ12 gave the expected 0.90 kb product, whereas as the wild-type showed two products, 0.20 and 0.70 kb (Figure 2B). LC-MS analysis revealed that the production of APs was abolished in BLQ12, and instead PNDs were accumulated in BLQ12 (Figure 2C).

Further support for the involvement of Asm10 in ansamitocin biosynthesis came from complementation of the mutant BLQ12. An intact copy of *asm10* under the control of the *PermE\** promoter was introduced into BLQ12 by conjugation, and the derivative was named KW2. LC-MS analysis of the extract of KW2 showed a nearly identical chromatogram to that of the wild-type, that is, the production of APs was fully restored by expression of the cloned *asm10* in the mutant (Figure 2C).

#### In vitro N-methylation of desmethyl-ansamitocin (PND) by Asm10

To verify that Asm10 indeed catalyzes the methylation at the macrolactam amide nitrogen of ansamitocins, the *asm10* gene was amplified by PCR from the *A. pretiosum* genome and cloned into plasmid pET28a. Asm10 was overexpressed in *E. coli* BL21(DE3)pLysE as an N-terminally His<sub>6</sub>-tagged fusion protein and purified with Ni-NTA agarose resin. The estimated molecular weight of His<sub>6</sub>-Asm10 is 33 kDa from SDS-PAGE (Figure 3A); this is consistent with its theoretical molecular weight of 32.97 kDa. The molecular weight of the purified Asm10 protein was further determined to be 33.0 kDa by gel filtration (Figure S4 in the Supporting Information), thus implying its presence as a monomer.

The enzymatic properties of Asm10 were examined by using PND-3 isolated from the *asm10* mutant grown on solid ISP2 medium as substrate. The reactions were performed with PND-3 (5 μL, 5 mM in DMSO), SAM (3.1 μL, 32 mM) in 0.1 mL basal reaction solution. The reaction product was identified as AP-3 by LC-MS compared with an authentic AP-3. Based on the reaction temperature profile from 0 to 50 °C, purified Asm10 was optimally active at 32 °C and exhibited more than 75% of its maximal activity between 30 and 35 °C (Figure 3B). The pH profile was determined at 32 °C in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 5.5 to 13.0), and the optimal pH is 10.0 with more than

a least-squares fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation resulted in a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of $36.7 \pm 8.98 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$, a $K_{\mathrm{cat}}$ of $168.0 \pm 12.95 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and a $K_{\mathrm{cat}} / K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of $4.46 \, \mu \mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ for PND-3. On the other hand, a $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of $66.08 \pm 8.04 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$, a $K_{\mathrm{cat}}$ of $111.8 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$, and a $K_{\mathrm{cat}} / K_{\mathrm{m}}$ of $1.69 \, \mu \mathrm{M}^{-1} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ were identified for SAM (Figure 4).

In vitro methylation of other ansamycins and synthetic lactams by Asm10

To evaluate the substrate flexibility of Asm10, two ansamycins, geldanamycin and rifamycin SV, and synthetic indolin-2-one derivatives HC-14 and HC-52 [16] were used as the methyl recipients at $250 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$ in standard assays with SAM. LC-MS analysis of these assays indicated that all these four substrates were converted to the corresponding methylated products. In the LC-MS spectra, quasimolecular ion peaks were seen for geldanamycin with an $m / z$ of 583.4 ([${M}_{\mathrm{s}}+\mathrm{Na}]^{+}$) and for the methylated product with an $m / z$ of 597.2 ([${M}_{\mathrm{p}}+\mathrm{Na}]^{+}$). Similarly for rifamycin SV with an $m / z$ of 720.4 ([${M}_{\mathrm{p}}+\mathrm{Na}]^{+}$), the methylated product was detected with an $m / z$ of 734.5 ([${M}_{\mathrm{p}}+\mathrm{Na}]^{+}$). Moreover, the corresponding methylated products of HC-14 ($m / z$ 226.2 [${M}_{\mathrm{s}}+\mathrm{Na}]^{+}$) and HC-52 ($m / z$ 399.4 [${M}_{\mathrm{s}}+\mathrm{H}]^{+}$) were observed with an $m / z$ of 240.3 ([${M}_{\mathrm{p}}+\mathrm{Na}]^{+}$) and $m / z$ of 413.3 ([${M}_{\mathrm{p}}+\mathrm{H}]^{+}$), respectively (Figure 5). However, although all the methylated products could be detected by mass spectrometry, no HPLC peak was found for any of these products; this made structure elucidation through NMR nearly impossible at this stage. Except for AP-3, the structures of all the products in Figure 5 were arbitrarily proposed with the methylation occurring on the nitrogen of the amide bond.

Asp154 and Leu155 are essential for the methylation by Asm10

Various studies have shown that the size of N-MT domains is typically 450 amino acids, while C-MT and O-MT are generally

Asm10 shared the highest similarity to ML2640c from *Mycobacterium leprae*, and two amino acid residues, Asp154 and Leu155, could be the SAM binding sites in Asm10 (http://swissmodel.expasy.org/). Multiple alignment of the LCM methyltransferase superfamily showed these two amino acids are conserved in all the sequences (Figure S3).

The involvement of Asp154 and Leu155 in the methylation of PND-3 was studied by site-directed mutagenesis. These mutated proteins were expressed and purified (Figure S5), and their specific activities were measured by using PND-3 as the substrate. Whereas the L155I mutated protein displayed a 40% reduction in methylation activity, the other mutated proteins (L155A, D154E or D154A) almost lost their methylation activity (Figure 6 A). The L155A mutant only retained 3.52% methylation activity, and D154E kept only 0.82% activity, as calculated from the HPLC peaks. Further kinetic analysis of the L155I mutant showed a $K_{\text{m}}$ of $45.2 \pm 5.34 \, \mu \text{M}$, a $K_{\text{cat}}$ of $111.3 \, \text{s}^{-1}$, and a $K_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$ of $2.46 \, \mu \text{M}^{-1} \text{s}^{-1}$ for PND-3, thus indicating a much reduced catalytic activity compared to the wild-type Asm10 (Figure 6 B). Therefore, the two residues, Asp154 and Leu155, are essential for methylation by Asm10, possibly for SAM binding.

### Discussion

Ansamitocins' biosynthesis includes various post-PKS modifications, such as N-methylation, that are essential for their bioactivities. Previously, Asm25-catalyzed N-glycosylation of the amide bond was proven to be the last modification step of the post-PKS modifications. In this work, a gene deletion experiment showed that the asm10 mutant accumulated the same product PNDs. Furthermore, in vitro experiments showed that Asm10 and Asm25 used the same substrates, PNDs, but produced different products: ansamitocins and ansamitocosides, respectively. Therefore, methylation of the same amide nitrogen by Asm10 is an alternative reaction to the glycosylation catalyzed by the N-glycosyltransferase Asm25. During fermentation in liquid or solid media, *A. pretiosum* produces more ansamitocins with an $N$-methyl group than ansamitocoside with an $N$-glucosyl group; this indicates that Asm10 could utilize the PNDs as substrate more effectively than Asm25 (Y. Li and L.B., unpublished results).

300 amino acids. However, as a putative N-MT in ansamitocin biosynthetic gene cluster, Asm10 contains only 295 amino acids. By further putative conserved domain prediction and phylogenetic analysis of the protein sequences, Asm10 was categorized to the LCM (leucine carboxyl MTs) superfamily in the O-MTs family (Figure S1). In silico analysis indicated that

hydrogen-bonding interactions with the side chain of Asp154 and the nitrogen of Leu155 (Figure S3). [18] Our results showed that mutation of these two residues drastically reduced or abolished the methylation activity of Asm10, thus suggesting Asp154 to be the general base for the methylation reaction.

Usually SAM-dependent MTs do not have additional domains at the core fold, but all of them have additional domains at the N terminus. [18] However, additional domains were found both at the N terminus and the core fold in Asm10 (Figure S2). The additional N-terminal α1–α3 domains might contain some residues attributed to SAM-binding by forming electrostatic interactions. On the other hand, the presence of additional α4–α5 domains (between β5 and αE) and α6–α7 (between β6 and β7) could probably enlarge the cavity for substrate binding; this indicates flexibility towards small or medium-size substrates. In our study, Asm10 did show substrate flexibility towards small substrates (HC-14 and HC-52) and large substrates including rifamycin, geldanamycin, and desmethyl-ansamitocin (Figure 5).

## Conclusions

We have shown that Asm10 is responsible for the N-methylation of the amide bond in ansamitocin biosynthesis, and identified it as a SAM-dependent methyltransferase in the LCM family. Asm10 is probably a basophilic N-methyltransferase that maintains good activity under basic conditions. For the first time, Asp154 and Leu155 were experimentally proven to be required for the methylation activity in LCM family.

## Experimental Section

### Bacterial strains and plasmids: Strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.

### Sequence analysis: DNA sequencing was performed at Shanghai Invitrogen Inc., and multiple sequence alignment was performed with BioEdit 7.0. The phylogenetic relationship was analyzed by MEGA 3.0 software. Open-reading frames (ORFs) and ribosome binding sites (RBS) were predicted by using Frameplot 3.0. [25] Similarity comparisons of nucleotide or amino acid sequences against a public database were done by using the BLAST program on the NCBI website (http://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast). [26]

### Inactivation of methyltransferase gene asm10 [16] and complementation of asm10 mutant BLQ12 with cloned asm10: The asm10 gene from the ansamitocin producer A. pretiosum was amplified by using the following primers: asm10-F (5′-AAA GGA TCC ATG AGC CTC CCA GCG GA-3′) with the engineered BamHI site underlined and the NdeI site in italics, and asm10-R (5′-AAA GAA TTC CTA CCC CAG CTC GGC CTC GAA CAG-3′) with the engineered EcoRI site underlined. PCR conditions were as follows: 5 min at 94 °C, 5 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 50 °C, 45 s at 68 °C, 25 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 30 s at 65 °C, 45 s at 68 °C, and 5 min at 68 °C with 1 U KOD plus (Toyobo (Shanghai) Biotech Co., Ltd.).

The PCR product was digested by NdeI and EcoRI, and cloned into plasmid pLB139 to obtain pJTU3237, which was introduced from E. coli into the asm10 mutant BLQ12 through conjugation. Confirmation was carried out through plasmid rescue from the possible exconjugants. An exconjugant carrying the correct plasmid was

Among the three MTs that were putatively assigned to the biosynthesis of ansamitocins, Asm7 and Asm17 are functionally assigned as O-MTs, whereas Asm10 was found to be similar to some S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)-dependent O-MTs but catalyzes N-methylation. More than 150 different MTs have been categorized by the Enzyme Commission, and the numbers are still rapidly increasing; [19] however, the SAM-dependent MTs share little sequence identity, and the residues that bind the common cofactor SAM are poorly conserved.

It has been shown that MTs can utilize various amino acid residues, including tyrosine, lysine, arginine, glutamate, and histidine, as a general base. [20–23] The starting point for the SAM-dependent catalytic reaction is the formation of a Michaelis complex, in which both SAM and the methyl acceptor substrate are bound to the enzyme. [24] For the LCM family, including Asm10, the adenine base of SAM might be stabilized by

chloramphenicol (25 μg mL⁻¹) at 37°C and 220 rpm for 12 h. The seed culture was then diluted at 1:50 (v/v) with fresh LBBS medium (1% tryptone, 0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl, 18.59% sorbitol, 0.03% betaine, pH 7.2, w/v). The diluted cultures were grown to OD₆₀₀ = 0.4~0.6, then induced with 0.2~1.0 mM IPTG, and incubated further for 20 h at 20°C, 220 rpm.

The cells from 200 mL culture were harvested by centrifugation (5000 rpm, Fiberlite F14-6×250LE fixed-angle rotor, 4°C, 15 min), resuspended in buffer A (20 mL, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl), and lysed by French Press (Thermo) with two passages. After centrifugation (12,000 rpm, Fiberlite F18-12×50 fixed-angle rotor, 4°C, 30 min), the protein supernatant was loaded onto Ni-NTA agarose resin (2.5 mL bed volume, Qiagen) equilibrated with lysis buffer. The column was washed with binding buffer (25 mL, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) and wash buffer (25 mL, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 60 mM imidazole). N-terminally His₆-tagged Asm10 (His₆-Asm10) was then eluted with buffer A (15 mL) supplemented with imidazole (200 mM) and concentrated by ultrafiltration with concomitant buffer exchange to Tris (50 mM, pH 8.0). The supernatant (ca. 200 μL) was collected and used for subsequent enzymatic assays. Protein purity and molecular mass were examined by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining of the gel. For SDS-PAGE, the protein solution was mixed with Laemmli sample buffer containing β-mercaptoethanol (5%) and incubated at 100°C for 10 min. The protein concentration was measured to be 100 μM against BSA concentration standards.

Gel filtration: The molecular mass of Asm10 was determined by gel filtration with a Superdex 200 HR 10/30 column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) equilibrated with Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) by using an AKTA fast protein liquid chromatography system (FPLC). Blue Dextran 2000 was applied to determine the void volume (V₀) and check the column packing first, then the column was calibrated with the following gel filtration molecular weight markers (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech): aldolase (158 kDa), albumin (67 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa). The molecular weight of Asm10 was calculated by the calibration curve.

Characterization of Asm10: The enzymatic reaction mixture contained SAM (1 mM, New England Biolabs), MgCl₂ (0.5 mM), dithiothreitol (DTT, 1 mM), PND-3 (250 μM), Asm10 (2 μM) and Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 7.0) in a total volume of 0.1 mL. The temperature optimum for Asm10 activity was examined by incubating the mixture for 1 h at 0, 10, 20, 30, 32, 35, 37, 40, 42, 45, or 50°C. The pH optimum was determined by incubating the mixture for 1 h at 32°C in Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM) at pH 5.5, 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, 8.0, 8.5, 9.0, 9.5, 10.0, 10.5, 11.0, 11.5, 12.0, 12.5, or 13.0. To detect the consumption of substrate at fixed pH, reactions were stopped after 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 45, 60, 90, or 120 min at pH 9, 10, or 11. All assays were performed in triplicate, and reactions with boiled Asm10 were used as the negative control. The reaction mixtures were extracted with n-butanol (50 μL), and the organic phase was collected by centrifugation and used directly for LC-MS analysis.

Kinetic analysis of Asm10: Enzymatic kinetics were determined at 32°C in basal reaction solution (0.1 mL; 1 mM SAM, 0.5 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM DTT, 2 μM Asm10 and 50 mM Tris-HCl [pH 10.0]) with various concentrations of PND-3. To determine the initial reaction rate, 10 min incubation time was chosen so that there was less than 30% conversion of the substrate PND-3 to product. The initial reaction rate profile was constructed with PND-3 at 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, and 250 μM. In addition, the enzymatic kinetics of Asm10

named as KW2, and the control exconjugant carrying only the pLB139 vector was named as KW1. The wild-type strains, KW1 and KW2 were characterized by fermentation and LC-MS analysis.

Construction of the Asm10 expression plasmid and site-directed mutagenesis of Asm10: The above PCR product was digested with BamHI and EcoRI, and ligated with pET28a (Invitrogen) digested with the same enzymes to generate pJ TU 3239. The sequence of the cloned asm10 was confirmed by sequencing.

Following the manufacturer's instruction for the QuickChange site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene), pJ TU 3239 was used as a template for site-directed mutagenesis to construct four mutants with individual amino acid alteration (D154A, D154E, L155I, L155A). Primers used for site-directed mutagenesis are shown in Table S1. A 50 μL reaction mixture contained pJ TU 3239 (50 ng), forward primer (25 ng), reverse primer (25 ng), dNTPs (0.8 mM), 5% (v/v) DMSO, MgCl₂ (4 mM), and 2.5 U Stratagene PFU Ultra. The amplification program used was 95°C for 1 min, 30 cycles of 95°C for 1 min, annealing temperature (see Table S1) for 1 min, and 68°C for 6.5 min, and a final step at 68°C for 7 min. The amplified products were digested with 10 U of DpnI for 1 h at 37°C and transformed into E. coli DH10B competent cells. Plasmids were analyzed by sequencing to ensure the desired mutations obtained.

Expression and purification of Asm10 and its mutated proteins: pJ TU 3239 and mutated plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3)pLysE, and transformants were grown as seed culture in LB liquid medium supplemented with kanamycin (50 μg mL⁻¹) and

were further determined with SAM at 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 200, and 250 μM in basal reaction solution (0.1 mL; 1 mM PND-3, 0.5 mM MgCl₂, 1 mM DTT, 2 μM Asm10, and 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 10.0). Each reaction mixture was extracted with *n*-butanol (50 μL), and the *n*-butanol phase was collected by centrifugation and used directly for LC-MS analysis. All reactions were performed in triplicate. The software Prism 5 was used for the calculation of \( K_{\mathrm{m}} \) and \( V_{\max } \).

Preparation and identification of PND-3, AP-3 and other substrates: Fermentation was carried out with 3 L solid ISP2 medium for eight days at 30 °C. The collected culture was extracted three times with ethyl acetate/methanol/acetate (80:15:5, v/v/v) to afford a crude extract (10.0 g). The extract was fractionated with Amberlite XAD-16 eluted with a gradient of 50, 70, and 100% ethanol. The fraction eluted with 70% ethanol (150 mg) was further separated, as previously described,[4] to afford PND-3 (15 mg). Similarly, AP-3 (10 mg) was isolated from the fermentation products of the strain *A. pretiosum* ATCC 31565. PND-3 was obtained as a white powder, C₃₁H₄₁ClN₂O₉, ESI-MS *m/z*: 621.3 [M+H]⁺, 643.3 [M+Na]⁺. AP-3 was obtained as a light yellow amorphous powder, C₃₂H₄₃ClN₂O₉, ESI-MS *m/z*: 635.5 [M+H]⁺, 657.3 [M+Na]⁺.

Substrate specificity of Asm10: Rifamycin SV (Shanghai Wee-Beyond Scientific & Trade Co., Ltd., China), geldanamycin (Beijing Rapidbio Co. Ltd., China), and two synthetic indolin-2-one compounds HC-14 and HC-52[16] were tested as substrates for His₆-Asm10 in reaction solution (0.1 mL), containing SAM (1 mM), MgCl₂ (0.5 mM), DTT (1 mM), substrate (250 μM), Asm10 (2 μM), and Tris-HCl (50 mM, pH 10.0). Control reactions were set up with boiled His₆-Asm10 added. All reactions were incubated at 32 °C for 1 h, stopped by adding *n*-butanol (50 μL), and centrifuged for 5 min at 12000 rpm (Fiberlite F18-12×50 fixed-angle rotor). Subsequent analysis of the supernatant was performed by using LC-MS. Each assay was carried out in triplicate.

Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis: LC-MS analysis was carried out on an Agilent 1100 HPLC system. The samples were separated on an Agilent RP18 column (2.1 mm × 150 mm, pore size 3.5 μm) by using gradient elution (0–10 min 10–55% buffer B, 10–20 min 55–75% buffer B, 20–35 min 75–95% buffer B, 35–45 min 95% buffer B, 45–50 min 95–10% buffer B, buffer A: H₂O with 0.5% formic acid; buffer B: methanol) at a flow rate of 0.1 mL·min⁻¹. UV detection was performed at 254 nm. HPLC quantitative analysis was performed on a Waters series HPLC 2690 instrument with a Waters 996 photodiode array detector, and the data were analyzed with a Waters Millennium Chromatography Manager. The samples were loaded onto a Waters Xterra RP18 column (3.9 mm × 150 mm, pore size 5 μm) and eluted with isocratic elution (methanol/H₂O 65:35, v/v) at a flow rate of 200 μL·min⁻¹. AP-3 was used as an external standard. The calibration curve was constructed based on peak areas of the calibrated standards within the range of 0.1~100 μg·μL⁻¹ for AP-3. Concentrations of all analytes were calculated from their peak areas against the calibration curve.
