# Asthma: new developments concerning immune mechanisms, diagnosis and treatment
Richard M. Effros<sup>a</sup> and Hari Nagaraj<sup>b</sup>

## Purpose of review
This brief review discusses how recent research may modify our understanding of the immunology of asthma. Consideration is given to the possible impact that these observations may have upon diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

## Recent findings
New studies indicate that current conceptions regarding the balance between Th1 and Th2 systems may need modification. The relationship between infection and the development of asthma in children has proven to be much more complex than originally suggested by the ‘hygiene hypothesis’. In addition, important genetic differences have been found in the response of asthmatic patients to therapeutic agents.

## Summary
Greater insight into the mechanisms responsible for asthma and the introduction of new drugs will depend in part upon the development of reliable and simple methods for detecting airway inflammation. As the immunologic aspects of asthma are dissected, we can expect that many more potential targets for treatment will be discovered, but treatment may have to be individualized for genetic differences between different individuals.

## Introduction
Much of the current excitement about asthma is related to our increasing understanding of the complex immunology of asthma. These insights have already led to the development of some of the first truly innovative therapies in the last few decades. To facilitate this presentation, a simplified outline of the Th1/Th2 scheme is provided [1**,2**]. A brief review of the current status of the ‘hygiene hypothesis’ is presented with some recent observations that bear upon the Th1/Th2 balance and airway remodeling. This is followed by a survey of new methods for monitoring airway inflammation and research regarding some older and newer treatments for this all too often frustrating and disabling disorder.

## Th1/Th2 balance and asthma
The abnormal response of airways in asthmatic patients is related in large part to the types of lymphocytes that are activated in this disorder. As indicated in Fig. 1, antigen constituents are processed by cells referred to as antigen presenting cells (APCs). Most of the APCs are either various populations of dendritic cells, many of which reside in the airway epithelium, or macrophages. Some foreign molecules (e.g., endotoxin and viral DNA) attach themselves to Toll like receptors (TLRs) on the surface of dendritic cells and macrophages. TLRs are an important part of the ‘innate immune system’, which is designed to interact with broad classes of proteins or carbohydrates that are shared by groups of invading organisms. Other antigens stimulate reactions to more specific responses (‘adaptive immune system’). The APCs interact with CD4 helper T lymphocytes, which are activated by cytokines released from the APCs and other cells to become either Th1 or Th2 cells. These two groups of T helper cells are distinguished by the cytokines that they release: Th1 cells are most precisely identified by production of interferon-γ whereas Th2 cells produce IL-4 and IL-5. Th1 cell proliferation is stimulated by intracellular bacteria such as tuberculosis and *Listeria*, which infect macrophages and promote the secretion of IL-12. IL-12 activates the transcription factors T-bet and STAT4, which in turn promote differentiation of T cells into Th1 cells. In contrast, exposures of tissues to helminthes and other antigens activate STAT6 and GATA-3 in the Th cells, which then mature into Th2 cells.

As noted in Fig. 1, a shift in the Th population to Th1 tends to discourage production of Th2 cells whereas

In this much simplified outline, naïve Th cells (also referred to as ThP cells) differentiate into either Th1 or Th2 subtypes. A wide variety of cytokines foster either subtype and once established, Th1 and Th2 cells suppress one another (broken arrows). Th1 activity is directed in large part against intracellular organisms. In contrast, Th2 reactions result in allergic responses, such as asthma, and target large extracellular pathogens such as helminthes. Th2 stimulate the formation of IgE by B-lymphocytes. IgE molecules bind to FcεR1 receptors located on mast cells. Antigens react with these IgE molecules bound to the cell membrane of the basophils and result in the secretion of multiple inflammatory mediators, including histamine, leukotrienes and cytokines. Th2 cells also stimulate eosinophils to release a variety of proteins, enzymes and cytokines. Not shown are T regulatory cells (T-regs), which suppress antigen-reactive T cells. Th1 reactions also activate natural killer cells (NK), which release proteins and peptidases that cause cells containing viruses to undergo apoptosis. Macrophages and polymorphonuclear cells are also activated by Th1 reactions.

increases in Th2 cells suppress Th1 cells. An increase in Th1 cell activity defends against intracellular microbes and can play a role in autoimmune reactions and granuloma formation (e.g., the tuberculin reaction). In contrast, increases in Th2 cells plays a critical role in immune reactions mediated by IgE, eosinophils and mast cells, and concentrations of Th2 cells and their cytokines are increased in asthmatic airways [3]. Recent evidence suggests that the abnormal shift to Th2 activity in asthmatics may be related to decreased function of another class of Th cells, referred to as regulatory T cells (Tregs) (not shown in Fig. 1). Treg cells appear to reduce Th2 activity in normal subjects. A population of natural killer T cells may also play a role in the pathogenesis of asthma [4*]. It had been hoped that increasing Th1 activity would be protective in asthma, but this has not yet been documented.

Following exposure of Th2 cells to APCs in a sensitized individual, the Th2 cells secrete IL-4, IL-5 and IL-13. Increases in IL-2, IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate the production of IgE by B cells (Fig. 1). IgE binds very tightly to receptors (FcεR1) on mast cells. When antigens bind to these IgE molecules, vasoactive amines and cytokines are released. IL-5 activates eosinophils, which bind to surfaces covered by IgE. Eosinophils then secrete major basic and major cationic proteins, which can disrupt the tough coat of helminthes or damage lung surfaces.

Asthma is characterized by type I ('immediate') hypersensitivity responses, which typically occur in two phases in sensitized subjects and autoimmune reactions. The immediate reaction occurs within a few minutes and is characterized by vasodilation, congestion and edema. This is associated with attachment of antigens to IgE bound to FcεR1 receptors on the surface of basophils. When these receptors are linked by multiple sites on the antigen, a signaling cascade is triggered which results in the release of a variety of inflammatory mediators indicated in Fig. 1. The first phase is followed some hours later by the late phase with an influx of neutrophils, eosinophils and Th2 lymphocytes into the airways.

## The hygiene hypothesis

The distinction between Th1 and Th2 activity in the lungs and other target tissues provided a rationale for what has been described as the 'hygiene hypothesis' of asthma. Strachan proposed [5] that when children are exposed to other children or a farm environment at an early age, they are less likely to develop bronchial asthma. This has been attributed to recurrent viral and bacterial infections in the exposed children, which tend to

promote Th1 and discourage Th2 activity. Unfortunately, interactions between early antigenic exposures and the subsequent development of asthma have proven extraordinarily complex. Among infections and other environmental challenges that have been studied are viruses (e.g., rhinovirus and respiratory syncitial virus) [6*,7*], bacterial infections (e.g., *Salmonella* and mycobacteria), bacterial constituents (e.g., endotoxin and muramic acid) [8*] and parasites [9*]. The likelihood that such exposures will have protective (Th1) or allergic (Th2) effects appears to be related to multiple factors such as the age and genetic susceptibility of the child, as well as the intensity and duration of the exposure [10*,11*]. Both bacterial infections (e.g., *Chlamydia*) [12**] and viral infections (e.g., respiratory syncitial virus) are very frequent in children and adults having asthmatic attacks and may actually induce an excessive Th2 profile [13*]. It was suggested that atopy with high Th2 activity would suppress autoimmune disease, which is associated with Th1 activity, but no relationship was found in patients with autoimmune disease [14].

### Recent observations regarding Th1/Th2 balance

Many recent observations can be understood in terms of the Th1/Th2 balance. Increases in airway Th2 cells and cytokines are found in asthma [3]. Furthermore, low dose steroids and β-agonists appear to shift the balance of Th1/Th2 toward Th1 [15]. Clara cells secrete abundant quantities of a 10kD protein (CC10) into the airways which also reduces the Th2 activity relative to Th1 [16].

Although it was thought that inhibition of IL-4 and 5 should be effective in treating asthma (see Fig. 1) and even though eosinophilia was suppressed this approach has not proven to be clinically useful [17,18*,19]. Nor has administration of IL-12 or IFN-γ, which should suppress Th2 activity (Fig. 1), been found effective [20].

Since TNF is generally associated with Th1 rather than Th2 hypersensitivity it was not anticipated that it would play a central role in asthma. TNF-α is the principal mediator involved in the response to Gram negative bacteria and other infections. As noted in Fig. 1, however, TNF-α is secreted by multiple cells including macrophages, stimulated T cells and mast cells, and recent evidence suggests that it may play a role in severe asthma. Increased expression of membrane bound TNF-α, TNF-α receptor 1, and TNF-α converting enzyme was found associated with peripheral blood monocytes in patients with moderate to severe asthma. After 10 weeks of treatment with etanercept, which inhibits TNF activity, methacholine sensitivity declined, quality of life score improved and post bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV₁) increased [21**,22**]. Subsequent

studies, however, suggested that the response may be relatively modest [23,24].

Among the many factors that help to regulate Th2 differentiation, attention has focused on the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4). This molecule plays an important role in suppressing Th2 differentiation. It is located on the surface of activated T cells, where it normally weakens the tendency of CD28 to promote Th2 activation. Several single nucleotide polymorphisms in the CTLA-4 gene appear to be associated with increased IgE levels, allergy, asthma, and FEV₁ predicted below 80% [25].

Evidence has been reported for the presence of a novel form of T-cell (CD4+ invariant T-cell-receptor+ natural killer T cells, NKTCs) in bronchoalveolar samples and blood of 14 patients with moderate to severe asthma [26**]. These cells respond to glycolipids rather than peptides on the surface of APCs. They produce both Th1 and Th2 cytokines and can have multiple effects on other cells in the lungs. The NKTCs reportedly accounted for 60% of the pulmonary CD4+ and CD3+ cells in the lungs of asthmatic patients. Comparable cells play an important role in mouse models of asthma, and the authors suggested they might also be important in human asthma [26**]. This remarkable observation, however, has since been challenged [27,28].

Concern that the Th1/Th2 balance cannot fully explain the cause or course of bronchial asthma has prompted studies of other cells in the lungs, including the airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells [29**,30**]. Of particular interest have been observations that seem to show that fluid obtained by bronchoalveolar lavage from asthmatic patients promotes proliferation of ASM cells, an effect which is augmented by major house dust mite allergen [29**,30**]. ASM cells from asthmatic patients appear to proliferate more rapidly than normal ASM cells and display other properties that may contribute to formation of abnormal fibrous tissue during remodeling, and produce less of the bronchodilator PGE2. Roth *et al.* [31] suggested that abnormalities in asthmatic cells may be due to the absence of an antiproliferative isoform of C/EBPα, an important regulator of cell proliferation and inflammation

### Airway remodeling

The role of airway remodeling in determining the course of bronchial asthma remains a key area of asthma research [32*–34*]. These histological changes, which are particularly pronounced in smaller airways, include smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyperplasia, goblet cell metaplasia, submucosal gland proliferation, increased vascularity, subepithelial fibrosis and thickening of the

lamina reticularis. Studies in mice suggest that these alterations are associated with increases in the concentrations of a wide variety of cytokines and other inflammatory mediators including IL-13. There is evidence for interactions between Th2 cells and the airway epithelium, which in turn secretes epithelial growth factor and other proteins that promote fibrosis and remodeling. These changes may lead to an irreversible component of increased airway resistance as well as the production of mucus plugs, which obstruct the airways. It is by no means clear whether remodeling can be suppressed with steroids or other conventional therapies, and it is difficult to distinguish between remodeling and reversible bronchoconstriction. Vascular proliferation is characteristic of remodeling in bronchial asthma. A recent report found increases in vascular endothelial growth factor in airway tissues and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid associated with angiogenic sprouts in subjects with asthma [35**].

### Monitoring airway inflammation

Considerable effort has been devoted to the development of noninvasive methods for collecting airway secretions that avoid the inevitable risks, expense and inconvenience of bronchoalveolar lavage. Collection of sputum from asthmatic patients has been facilitated by inhaling hypertonic saline. About half of asthmatics have increased eosinophils (>1%) in induced sputum samples [36*]. Asthmatic patients with noneosinophilic asthma are less likely to respond to inhaled steroids. Induced sputum has also been useful for detecting characteristic changes in mRNA for Th1 and Th2 cytokines in airway secretions [37*].

Smith [38*] published evidence that the fraction of nitric oxide in exhaled air can also be used to guide steroid therapy in chronic asthma without imperiling respiratory symptoms. Baseline values, however, are variable between subjects and it is not clear which cells are responsible for nitric oxide production.

Fluid can be condensed from the exhaled air by cooling. Increased cytokine concentrations were reported in exhaled breath condensates (EBCs) collected from asthmatic patients [39]. When dilutional indicators were included in these studies, however, it was possible to show that airway droplets represent about 1/10,000th of the EBC volume and increases in EBC cytokine concentrations can represent the production of more respiratory droplets rather than an increase in airway concentrations [40,41]. EBC concentrations of cytokines are frequently far below the sensitivity of current assays. Interpretation of EBC data requires inclusion of sensitive salivary markers to rule out oral contamination and dilutional indicators to estimate airway concentrations. Condensates should not generally be used to study volatile constituents in the exhaled air since the concentrations collected will be influenced by their distribution between water and air in the condensers and many of these substances may be produced in the mouth rather than the lungs.

Much excitement was generated by the observation that the EBC tends to be acidic in asthmatic patients, suggesting airway acidification [42,43]. Interpretation of EBC pH is complicated, however, by the fact that most of the buffer pairs in the EBC (NH₄⁺/NH₃, HCO₃⁻/CO₂ and acetic acid/acetate) are generated in the mouth and ambient air, and these extrapulmonary constituents must set the pH of the EBC [44**]. EBC acidification could also reflect acid reflux, which is common in asthmatic patients. A recent epidemiologic study of EBC pH was unable to distinguish between normal and asthmatic children [45*].

#### Perils and promise of therapy

Concern is rising that long-acting β-agonists (salmeterol and formoterol) may increase mortality in asthmatic patients [46*,47**,48*]. This problem may be related in part to polymorphisms in the structure of the β-agonist structure which reduce the response of these receptors [49*,50**,51*]. Restriction of the use of these widely used medications would have a major impact on current practice guidelines and alternatives may be much less effective in long-term maintenance, particularly in patients with severe disease.

Much variability is also found in the response of patients to steroids [52]. Some of these differences may be related to variation in the structure of an important transcription factor, TBX21 [53,54*], which plays an important role in Th1 cell commitment and secretion of IFN-γ. Loss of TBX21 function would tend to shift the balance of T cells to the Th2 cell line, thereby increasing resistance to glucocorticoids. Family studies suggest that this factor plays an important role in human as well as animal asthma.

Pooled data have confirmed the benefit of omalizumab significantly reduced the rate of asthma exacerbations by 38% (P < 0.0001 versus control) and the rate of total emergency visits by 47% (P < 0.0001 versus control). The patients who seem most likely to respond are those with perennial symptoms from aeroallergens and those who require high doses of corticosteroids, have frequent exacerbations requiring at least one emergency room visit during the last year and have an FEV₁ less than 65% predicted. IgE levels should be between 30 and 700 IU and patients should not weigh more than 150 kg [55*]. Dosage is adjusted to the initial IgE level. Expense of therapy varies between US$4000 and US$20,000 per year. Several weeks may be needed to document a response.

Complications appear infrequent, but there may be an increased incidence of cancer (0.5% versus 0.3% in controls). Omalizumab has been associated with upper respiratory infections and headaches. Although designed to avoid anaphylaxis by binding only to free rather than IgE bound to mast cells, a few cases of anaphylaxis have been described [56**,57*].

Johnston *et al.* [58**] provide evidence that telithromycin, a derivative of erythromycin, was clinically useful as an agent to treat bronchial asthma. They suggest that aside from any antibiotic effect, this drug may have a favorable effect on the immune system, but alternative explanations have been proposed: telithromycin is a strong inhibitor of cytochrome P-450 isoenzyme 3A4, which normally inactivates both steroids and β-agonists used in inhaled medications [59].

Other new therapies include roflumilast [60*] (a novel phosphodiesterase inhibitor), B-type natriuretic factor [61*], and bronchial thermoplasty [62**], a procedure in which a heat source at the end of a catheter is inserted into the proximal airways with a bronchoscope and airway surfaces are exposed briefly to temperatures of 65°C to reduce the thickness of the airway smooth muscle. A controlled study of helium/oxygen studies to improve airflow in acute childhood asthma proved ineffective [63*].

### Conclusion

As we learn more about the complexity and redundancy of the inflammatory events of asthma and the probable effects of genomic differences between patients, it is becoming clear why development of new treatments has been so difficult. Recent research into the underlying mechanisms of this disorder, however, and the development of new approaches for monitoring airway inflammation hold the promise of increasingly effective therapy.

There was an increased incidence of death.

49 Lima JJ, Holbrook JT, Wang J, *et al.* The C523A beta2 adrenergic receptor polymorphism associates with markers of asthma severity in African Americans. J Asthma 2006; 43:185–191.

This study suggested a link between asthma severity and race related to genome.

54 Raby BA, Hwang ES, Van Steen K, *et al.* T-bet polymorphisms are associated with asthma and airway hyperresponsiveness. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006; 173:64–70.

Knockout mice lacking T-bet (TBX21) are associated with airway hyperresponsiveness and histological changes consistent with asthma. Abnormalities in T-bet appeared to be associated with airway hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic patients.

Some guidelines for use of omalizumab.

58 Johnston SL, Blasi F, Black PN, *et al.* The effect of telithromycin in acute exacerbations of asthma. N Engl J Med 2006; 354:1589–1600.

This new class of antibiotics related to macrolides and are active against *Chlamydophila pneumoniae* and *Mycoplasma pneumoniae*. Although 61% of the patients had infections due to one or the other of these organisms, these infections did not appear to be related to the symptomatic improvement in these patients, leading the authors to conclude that the agent directly improved their asthma.

60 Karish SB, Gagnon JM. The potential role of roflumilast: the new phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. Ann Pharmacother 2006; 40:1096–1104.

This article summarizes experience with roflumilast asthma and COPD. Many of the problems with theophylline are related to its nonspecific effects on phosphodiesterase (PDE). This drug inhibits PDE-4, which is found in inflammatory cells and airway smooth muscle cells. The drug appears to be safe, but initial studies were conducted in young subjects.

61 Akerman MJ, Yaegashi M, Khiangte Z, *et al.* Bronchodilator effect of infused B-type natriuretic peptide in asthma. Chest 2006; 130:66–72.

Intravenous nisiritide resulted in improvement of FEV1 and FVC in patients with acute asthma.

62 Cox G, Miller JD, McWilliams A, *et al.* Bronchial thermoplasty for asthma. Am J Respir Crit Care Med 2006; 173:965–969.

- Improvement in airway responsiveness in mild to moderate asthma appeared to be sustained for 2 years. Procedure is invasive, relatively complex and would require training.
