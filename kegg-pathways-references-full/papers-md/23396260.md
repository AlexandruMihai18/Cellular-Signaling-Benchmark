**ARTICLE INFORMATION**

Abstract: The mammalian Hippo pathway comprises mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2). LATS1/2, which are activated by MST1/2, phosphorylate a transcriptional co-activator, yes-associated protein (YAP), and induce the recruitment of YAP by 14-3-3 to cytoplasm, so that the TEAD-dependent gene transcriptions are turned off. Although the core components of the Hippo pathway are well conserved in metazoans, it has been discussed that *Caenorhabditis elegans* lacks YAP ortholog, we found that F13E6.4 gene encodes a protein that shows sequence similarities to YAP in the N-terminal TEAD-binding domain and in the WW domain. We designated this gene as *yap-1*. YAP-1 is widely expressed in various cells such as epithelial cells, muscles, hypodermal cells, gonadal sheath cells, spermatheca, and hypodermal cells. YAP-1 is distributed in cytoplasm and nuclei. *wts-1* (LATS ortholog) and *ftt-2* (14-3-3 ortholog) knockdowns cause nuclear accumulation of YAP-1, supporting that the subcellular localization of YAP-1 is regulated in a similar way as that of YAP. Heat shock also causes the nuclear accumulation of YAP-1 but after heat shock, YAP-1 translocates to cytoplasm. Knockdowns of DAF-21 (HSP90 ortholog) and HSF-1 block the nuclear export of YAP-1 during this recovery. YAP-1 overexpression is beneficial for thermotolerance, whereas YAP-1 hyperactivity induced by *wts-1* and *ftt-2* knockdowns is deleterious on thermal response and *yap-1* deficiency promotes health aging. In short, YAP-1 partially shares basal characters with mammalian YAP and plays a role in thermal stress response and healthy aging.

PCR amplification of genomic sequence encompassing the deletions with specific primers (5′ GGGATGGGAAACGCCCTCCGAT3′ and 5′ GTTGCGGACTGTGACAAGT3′).

## Antibodies

Anti-YAP-1 and phospho-specific YAP-1 antibodies were raised against the synthetic peptides: CNNRGVGSMVHHYQ and CPIHTRQVp-SAPNLH (single letters represent amino acid residues; p-S means phosphorylated serine; cysteine is added for the conjugation with Keyhole Limpet Hemocyanin (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). Antibodies were purified through the peptide column for anti-YAP-1 antibody and through the unphosphorylated peptide column followed by the phosphorylated peptide column for phospho-specific YAP-1 antibody. The following antibodies were obtained from commercial sources: mouse anti-Myc (9E10) (American Type Culture Collection); mouse anti-FLAG M2 (F3165) and mouse anti-α-tubulin (Sigma-Aldrich); mouse anti-GFP (sc-9996) (Santa Cruz); rabbit anti-histone H3 (ab1791) (Abcam); and peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody (ICN Cappel).

## Transgenic animals and strain construction

Translational fusions *yap-1::GFP* was generated by cloning 5 kb of upstream regulatory sequence and 2.5 kb coding genomic sequence into the pPD95.75 vector, which contains the GFP coding sequence and the 3′ untranslated region of *unc-54*. This construct was injected into *lin-15(n765)* worms with *lin-15(+)* marker. Integration of *yap-1::GFP* extrachromosomal array was performed by the UV irradiation method [14]. To generate *yap-1(SA)::GFP*, the site direct mutagenesis was used for pPD95.75 bearing *yap-1::GFP*. This construct was injected into N2 worms with *Pmyo-2::mCherry*. A double-mutant strain containing *yap-1(tm1416)* and *zIs356[daf-16::GFP, rol-6(+)]* was obtained by constructing a *yap-1(tm1416)/zIs356* heterozygote, and then selecting *yap-1(tm1416)* deletion allele with GFP expression to obtain the *yap-1(tm1416)* homozygote with the *zIs356* transgene array.

## Microscopic observation

Animals were observed and photographed using a Leica DM6000B Microscope with a DFC310 FX Digital camera. Observations of fluorescence and DIC were recorded and images were taken from the documentation of results with Leica Application Suite V3 software. Young embryos freshly dissected from adult worms or post embryonic animals were washed in M9 buffer and gently placed on 2% agarose pads supplemented with 1 mM levamisole. For YAP-1::GFP translocation, the transgenic strain was treated with several stimuli and feeding RNAi as described below.

## Assay of thermotolerance

Synchronized young adult hermaphrodites were incubated at 35 °C. At the indicated times, worms were scored for motility, provoked movement, and pharyngeal pumping. Worms failing to display any of these traits were scored as dead. The unpaired t-test was used to determine statistical significance and calculate

## Introduction

The Hippo pathway is the tumor suppressor signaling that was first identified in *Drosophila* [1–4]. When the pathway is activated, Hippo kinase phosphorylates and activates Wts kinase, which phosphorylates and inactivates a transcriptional coactivator, Yorkie. As Yorkie interacts with a TEA domain (TEAD) family transcriptional factor, Scalloped, to induce cell cycle-promoting and anti-apoptotic gene transcriptions, the disorder of the Hippo pathway leads to organ overgrowth and oncogenesis [5,6]. The components of the Hippo pathway are well-conserved in mammals and some of them had been known as tumor suppressors before the emerging of the Hippo pathway. Yes-associated protein (YAP), mammalian Yorkie ortholog, is regulated by the mammalian Hippo pathway in largely the same manner as in *Drosophila*. In brief, Hippo orthologs, mammalian Ste20-like kinases (MST1/2), activate Wts orthologs, large tumor suppressor kinases (LATS1/2), which phosphorylate YAP and negatively regulate TEAD-mediated gene transcriptions. A recent study on the evolutionary roots of YAP and the Hippo pathway has revealed that the most basal YAP ortholog appears in the placozoan *Trichoplax adhaerens*, which lacks Salvador and LATS orthologs [7]. A whole set of the Hippo components including Salvador and LATS are detected in the cnidarian *Nematostella vectensis*. *Caenorhabditis elegans cst-1/2, wts-1*, and *egl-44* correspond to Hippo/MST, Wts/LATS, and Scalloped/TEAD, respectively. CST-1/2 phosphorylate DAF-16 to regulate life span [8]. WTS-1 is related to development [9–11]. EGL-44 is involved in mechanosensory neuron cell fate [12]. Apparently, these phenotypes are diverse and do not support that these components form a single signaling pathway. Moreover, Hilman and Gat discussed that *C. elegans* is diverged from the evolutionary tree and that it lacks YAP ortholog [7]. Therefore, it is not clear whether the Hippo pathway is conserved in *C. elegans*.

Despite the preceding argument that YAP ortholog is missing in *C. elegans*, F13E6.4 is registered as a gene that encodes a protein with one WW domain similar to those of YAP in the *C. elegans* genome database. In this study, we characterized this gene and the gene product and raised a question whether the gene product is regulated similarly to YAP and Yorkie. Our studies have demonstrated that F13E6.4 gene product is regulated by WTS-1, FTT-2, and DAF-21, and is involved in healthy aging and thermosensitivity.

## Materials and methods

### Strains and nematode growth

*C. elegans* were grown on nematode growth media (NGM) plates streaked with *Escherichia coli* (*E.coli*) OP50-1 (a streptomycin-resistant derivative of OP50) at 20 °C as described [13]. Strains used in this study include: *daf-16(mgDf50)*, *let-23(n1045)*, *ihEx33 [yap-1(SA):: green fluorescent protein (GFP), Pmyo-2::mCherry]*, *lin-15(n765)*; *ihls34[yap-1::GFP, lin-15(+)]*, *lin-15(n765)*; *ihls35[yap-1::GFP, lin-15(+)]*, *yap-1(tm1416)*, *yap-1(tm1416)*; *zIs356 [daf-16::GFP, rol-6(+)]*, *rol-6(su1006)*; *zIs356[daf-16::GFP, rol-6(+)]* and N2 wild type. We outcrossed *yap-1(tm1416)* six times with N2. The *yap-1(tm1416)* allele was tracked and/or sequenced by

P-values for the mean survival. The significance of differences between survival curves calculated using the log rank test.

### Lifespan analysis

Synchronous L1 animals were placed onto an NGM plate with OP50, and were incubated at 25°C. Animals were raised until the L4 molt and were subsequently transferred onto a new plate containing 40 μM 5-fluoro-2′-deoxyuridine to prevent self-fertilization. Animals that were lost, or exploded, or died from internal hatching of progeny were censored at the time of the event. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan Meier method on censored data, and the significance of differences between survival curves calculated using the log rank test. Maximum lifespan was determined by taking the mean age at death of the longest-lived 10% of a given test population [15]. The unpaired t-test was used to determine statistical significance and calculate P-values for the mean and maximum lifespan.

### Swimming analysis

The swimming assay was determined as described by Iwasa et al. [16]. Briefly, aged synchronous individual animals were transferred to M9 buffer on each experimental day. After a 10--30 s recovery period, the number of body bends was counted during a 30 s trial using a stereomicroscope for observation. A body bend was defined as a change in the reciprocating motion of bending at the mid-body. Only animals that could move away after a touch and could thrash were used for the swimming assay. The unpaired t-test was used to determine statistical significance and calculate P-values for the mean number of body bend.

### RNAi feeding

RNAi libraries were purchased by Geneservice and Open Biosystem. RNAi feeding was similar to as described in [17,18]. *E. coli* (HT115) producing dsRNA for individual genes was seeded onto RNAi plates containing 25 mg/ml carbenicillin with 0.2% lactose to induce the expression of the dsRNA for the gene of interest. The negative control was conducted by seeding the plates with HT115 containing empty vector pL4440. For observation of YAP-1::GFP and thermotolerance assay, animals were incubated with RNAi plates for 1 day at least before starting these experiments. For swimming assay, synchronous L4 stage animals were placed onto each plate. If *yap-1* RNAi treatment was started on L1 stage, animals induces severe protruding vulva phenotype, consequently explodes interior tissues and dies early distinct from aging. After growing to the young adult stage, animals were transferred away from their progeny to fresh HT115-seeded plates every 1–2 days until the end of the reproductive period.

### DNA constructions

cDNA of YAP-1, WTS-1, and EGL-44 were obtained by RT-PCR using the following primers; 5′-acgcgtatggcgctccaagagcattcat-3′/5′-ctcgagttattgataatggtgcaccat-3′ for YAP-1; 5′-acgcgtatgc-gacctgctccccctggt-3′/5′-ccgggaaatatgagacgatgaacttctt-3′ for WTS-1; and 5′-acgcgtatgaactcaatgttttgttcagag-3′/5′-gcggccgctcattcatcagaatcg-cctcct-3′ for EGL-44. YAP-1 S104A mutant was generated by PCR method to replace Serine104 with Alanine. YAP-1 WW and WTS-1 WBP harbor the amino acid residues, 192–251 of YAP-1 and 215–240 of WTS-1, respectively. PCR was performed on pGex4T-1 and pClneoFH with 5′-gctagcccccccacaatgtcccctatactaggtt-3′/5′-ttccggggatccacgcggaac-3′ and 5′-agatctgactacaaaagacgtgacgacaag-3′/5′-ctcgaggatccaagcgccgccgggtcgac-3′ as primers, respectively. PCR products were digested with NheI/BamHI and BglII/NotI, and ligated into NheI/NotI sites of pClneo to generate pClneoGST-FH vector. The mammalian expression constructs were generated using pClneoMyc, pClneoFH, pClneoEGFP, and pClneoGST-FH vectors.

### Cell cultures and transfection

HEK293 were cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 U/ml of penicillin, and 100 μg/ml of streptomycin under 5% CO₂ at 37°C. Transfection was performed with Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Invitrogen).

### Co-immunoprecipitation experiment

The co-immunoprecipitation was performed as described previously [19]. Briefly, HEK293 cells were transfected with various expression constructs. The cell lysates were prepared using 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 1 % (w/v) Triton X-100, 10 mg/l 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, 10 mg/l leupeptin, 10 mg/l pepstatin A, and 10 mg/l aprotinin, and then incubated with anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma-Aldrich). The gel was washed with 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH8.0) 33 mM NaCl, and 0.33 % (w/v) Triton X-100 three times, analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.

### Reporter assay

Reporter assay was performed as described previously [20]. HEK293 cells were plated at 4 × 10⁵ cells/12-well plate. Twenty-four hours later, cells were transfected with various combinations of 0.1 μg 8xGT-IIC-δ51LucII (TEAD reporter), 0.1 μg pCMV AP, 0.1 μg pClneoMyc EGL-44, and 0.1 μg pClneoMyc YAP-1 [21]. The total amount of DNA was adjusted by adding pClneoGFP (control). After 18 h incubation, cells were harvested and lysed in the buffer [25 mM Tris/HCl (pH 7.4), 2 mM EDTA (pH 8.0), 2 mM DTT, 1% (w/v) Triton X-100, 4 mM MgCl₂, 4 mM EGTA (pH 8.0), 1 μg/ml 4-amidinophenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride and 10% (v/v) glycerol]. Luciferase activity was measured using PicaGene (Toyo INK.). Alkaline phosphatase activity was measured using CDP-Star (Roche) in the assay buffer (98.4 mM glycine, pH 10.5, 1 mM MgCl₂ and 0.1 mM ZnCl₂).

### Quantitative RT-PCR

Quantitative RT-PCR analysis was performed using SYBR Green (Roche) and the DNA Engine Opticon system (Bio-Rad) as described previously [22]. The primers used are as follows; for wts-1, 5′-acacctggtggaaacacaaca-3′ and 5′-caacatcctcccgtgagat-3′; for *ftt-2*, 5′-tgagcagaagaccgaaggat-3′ and 5′-cctcagcgaggtaacgg-tag-3′; for *daf-21*, 5′-tctcgaaatcaacccagacc-3′ and 5′-ctccgatatc-gagaccaagc-3′; and for *eft-3*, 5′-cactccgtagcagccatggg-3′ and 5′-ctcctgagccttctctcg-3′. *eft-3* was used as control.

Subcellular fractionation of adult worms

Synchronized young adult nematodes were collected from 50 ml liquid culture in S-basal buffer (10 mM potassium citrate (pH 6.0), 3 mM CaCl₂, 3 mM MgSO₄, and trace metals solution) with OP-50-1. After washing with M9 buffer, the animals were resuspended in 0.5 volume of the extract buffer (10 mM HEPES(pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl₂, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, complete protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Inc.), and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Inc.). The suspension was dripped into liquid N2, and the resulting balls were ground in a mortar. The powder was thawed on ice and sheared using a Dounce homogenizer (30 strokes). Crude extracts were subsequently centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000 × g. The supernatant was designated as the cytosolic fraction. The pellet was washed three times with the extract buffer and resuspended in high-salt buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.9), 5 mM MgCl₂, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10% glycerol, protease inhibitor cocktail, and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail), incubated at 4 °C for 1 h with rocking, and centrifuged at (13,000 × g, 10 min). The supernatant was designated as the nuclear fraction.

Preparation of egg lysates

Eggs were collected from 50 ml liquid culture of synchronized young adult nematodes with bleaching solution (20% sodium hypochlorite and 0.7 N NaOH). The eggs were resuspended in 0.5 volumes of 1× SDS sample buffer and used for further analysis.

Results

Caenorhabditis elegans F13E6.4 encodes a putative homolog of mammalian YAP

Human YAP and its related transcriptional coactivator with PDZ-binding motif (TAZ) (also called WWTR1) are transcriptional coactivators that bind TEAD family member proteins and harbor one or two WW domains [6,23]. The C. elegans genome database (http://www.wormbase.org/) has registered a gene (F13E6.4) that encodes a protein with one WW domain. Our database search found that the WW domain of this protein shows sequence similarities with not only those of YAP but those of TAZ and Yorkie as well (Fig. 1A and Suppl. Fig. 1A). BLAST search with a whole amino acid sequence of F13E6.4 gene product picked the N-terminal region of YAP, which is the TEAD-binding domain (Suppl. Fig. 1B) [24]. This region shows 25% and 22% homologies at the amino acid level with the corresponding regions of YAP and Yorkie, respectively. We tested whether the TEAD-binding domain and the WW domain are functional. In the co-immunoprecipitation experiment using heterologous cells, the protein encoded by F13E6.4 interacted with EGL-44, a homolog of TEAD protein (Suppl. Fig. 2A). More importantly, the co-expression of F13E6.4 protein and EGL-44 activated TEAD reporter (Suppl. Fig. 2B). The WW domains of human YAP is the binding site of LATS1/2. Likewise, the putative WW domain of F13E6.4 protein interacted with the full-length WTS-1 and with the WW domain-binding motif derived from WTS-1 (Suppl. Fig. 2C). These findings support that F13E6.4 protein harbor functional TEAD-binding and WW domains. Therefore, we referred F13E6.4 to *yap-1* for Yes-Associated Protein homolog.

YAP-1 is expressed ubiquitously throughout all developmental stages

We first examined its expression and subcellular localization in postembryonic stage. YAP-1::GFP was widely localized in cytoplasm of several tissues in adult and larval stage (Fig. 1B and C). YAP-1::GFP was expressed in epithelial and muscular tissues including the seam cells (Fig. 1C, an arrowhead in larval animal), epithelial cells and pharynx muscles in a head region (Fig. 1D), the excretory tissue (Fig. 1E), hypodermal cells (Fig. 1F, arrowheads for nuclei of hypodermis), gonadal sheath cells (Fig. 1G), the spermatheca (Fig. 1H), the intestine (Fig. 1I), the vulva (Fig. 1J, an arrowhead for vulva cells), and hypodermal cells in a tail region (Fig. 1K). In mammalian embryos, nuclear YAP restricts in outer cells but not inner cells during early development stage [25]. Although we did not detect the expression of YAP-1::GFP during early/middle developmental stage (Fig. 2A), YAP-1::GFP appeared in cytoplasm of epithelial cells during/after active proliferation (Fig. 2B). YAP-1::GFP was transiently expressed in nuclei of the dorsal epidermal cells during the specific development stages, which are involved in dorsal intercalation and ventral enclosure (Fig. 2C, arrowheads in dorsal view; Fig. 2D, arrowheads in lateral view; and Fig. 2E, arrowheads in ventral view). YAP-1::GFP did not appear to be localized in nuclei of embryonic cells at the late development stage, when embryo undergoes elongation (Fig. 2F). Thus, YAP-1::GFP is likely to be temporarily localized in nuclei of embryonic epithelial cells, suggesting that the subcellular localization of YAP-1 may be regulated depending on developmental stage.

YAP-1 subcellular localization is independent of *cst-1/2*, but depends on *wts-1* and *ftt-2*

In mammals and fly, the Hippo pathway regulates the nuclear translocation of YAP, TAZ, and Yorkie [5,6,23,26]. C. elegans genome harbors putative Hippo pathway-related genes [7]. We raised a question whether these genes play roles in the regulation of YAP-1 localization. We focused on nine genes and performed food-delivered RNAi. In N2 wild type worm, YAP-1 was mainly localized in cytoplasm of hypodermis (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous reports that LATS1/2 and 14-3-3 are important to determine the cytoplasmic localization of YAP, knockdown of *wts-1* and *ftt-2* translocated YAP-1 into nuclei (Fig. 3B and C). Unexpectedly, RNAi knockdowns of the genes that may be the axis of the putative Hippo pathway, such as F09A5.4, *cst-1*, *cst-2*, *sav-1*, *rsf-1*, *frm-7*, and *nfm-1*, did not alter the localization of YAP-1 (Fig. 3D-I and Table 1). Akt kinases, angiominotin (AMOT), α-catenin, and actin also regulate YAP subcellular localization [27–33]. However, the knockdowns of AKT1 homolog (*akt-1*), AMOT homolog (F59C12.3), and actin-regulatory protein orthologs (*cas-1*, *cap-1*, *cap-2*, and *unc-60*) [34,35] did not change YAP-1 localization (Fig. 3J, K, and P-S). Transcriptional factors, SMAD proteins and Runx2, interact with YAP and are colocalized with YAP in nuclei [36–38]. However, the knockdowns of transcriptional factor orthologs (*mt-1*, *sma-2*, *sma-3*, and *sma-4*) had no effect, either (Fig. 3L-O).

S104-phosphorylated YAP-1 is localized in the cytosolic fraction but the single mutation of S104 of YAP-1 to alanine has no remarkable effect on YAP-1 subcellular localization

The above findings support that WTS-1 and FTT-2 regulate the subcellular localization of YAP-1 as LATS1/2 and 14-3-3 determine the cytoplasmic localization of YAP. In mammals, YAP has five putative LATS1/2 phosphorylation sites [39,40]. Among them, Serine127 (S127), which is overlapped by the optimal binding sequence for 14-3-3, is the most important and its mutation to alanine results in the nuclear accumulation of YAP. The sequence around S104 of YAP-1 (HTRQVSAP; single letters stand for amino acid residues) fits to the consensus for WTS-1 (HXRXXS/T; X stands for any amino acid residue) and to the putative 14-3-3 binding motif (RXXS/TXP) (Suppl. Fig. 1C). We hypothesized that WTS-1 phosphorylates S104 and regulates YAP-1 subcellular localization. To test this hypothesis, we raised phospho-specific YAP-1 antibody (Suppl. Fig. 3A). The antibody detected the wild type of YAP-1 expressed in HEK293 cells but not YAP-1 S104A mutant (Suppl. Fig. 3A, the left panel). The phosphorylated peptide abrogated the signal, whereas the unphosphorylated peptide did not (Suppl. Fig. 3A, the middle and the right panels). Although anti-phospho-specific YAP-1 antibody is not so sensitive as anit-YAP-1 antibody, these findings support that this antibody recognizes the phosphorylated YAP-1. We analyzed the subcellular fractions of young adult 5 days animals using this antibody. The phospho-specific YAP-1 antibody detected the signal in the cytosolic fraction, but not in the nuclear fraction (Suppl. Fig. 5A, the left panel, Pre HS). The YAP-1 antibody detected broad signals. The slowly migrating signals disappeared after λ protein phosphatase treatment and after the wts-1 RNA interference (Suppl. Fig. 3B and C). These findings support that YAP-1 is phosphorylated by WTS-1 and that S104-phosphorylated YAP-1 is recruited outside the nuclei and is detected as slowly migrating signals by YAP-1 antibody. We next substituted S104 of YAP-1::GFP to alanine (YAP-1(SA)::GFP) and expressed it in wild type animals. Contrary to our expectation, YAP-1(SA)::GFP remained in cytoplasm (Suppl. Fig. 4A). The knockdown of wts-1 or ftt-2 still induced the nuclear accumulation of YAP-1(SA)::GFP (Suppl. Fig. 4B and C). Given the ambiguous phosphorylation consensus sequence (HXH/R/KXXS/T) for WTS-1, in addition to S104, YAP-1 has three other putative phosphorylation sites (S136, S138, and S157) (Suppl. Fig. 1D). Therefore, YAP-1 may be phosphorylated by WTS-1 at these sites and their phosphorylations may trigger the interaction of YAP-1 with FTT-2.

Heat shock induces nuclear translocation of YAP-1

In mammals, the function of YAP is ambivalent. As YAP expression is high in many human cancers, YAP is principally regarded as oncogene. However, YAP also mediates apoptosis and functions as a tumor suppressor in some cells [41]. YAP S127A mutant, which is localized significantly in nuclei, has been widely used as an active form to analyze YAP function in mammals. As described above, YAP-1 S104A mutant is distributed in cytoplasm and is not suitable to analyze active roles of YAP-1. Alternatively, we tried to find out which stimuli induce

Subcellular localization of YAP-1::GFP in the hypodermis under normal condition, for which animals grow on the normal growth medium (NGM) at 20 °C. Either RNAi knockdown of *wts-1* or *ftt-2* specifically causes the nuclear translocation of YAP-1::GFP. YAP-1::GFP distribution was observed in *yap-1::GFP* animals grown at 20 °C on the RNAi medium for knockdown of interested genes. Arrow heads indicate hypodermal nuclei positions. Scale bars are 10 micrometer. Table 1 summarizes the genes that were knocked down.

the nuclear translocation of YAP-1. We first irradiated worms with 100 J m⁻² ultraviolet (UV) or 100 Gy X-ray, but could not detect any effect (Fig. 4A and B). 20 mM arsenite treatment, which generates oxidative stress, had no effect (Fig. 4C). Among tested stimuli, heat shock at 35 °C elevated levels of YAP-1::GFP in hypodermal nuclei (Fig. 4D). When animals were recovered at 20 °C after heat shock, YAP-1 remained in nuclei at 1 h post heat shock, but the subsequent redistribution to cytoplasm was observed at 6 h and at 12 h, which means that YAP-1 is exported from nuclei during the recovery post heat shock (Fig. 4E). We confirmed the effect of heat shock in the immunoblotting on the subcellular fractions and using the whole lysates of day 5 adult animals (Suppl. Fig. 5A). Heat shock abolished the slowly migrating bands in the immunoblotting with anti-YAP-1

mRNA expressions of *wts-1*, *ftt-2*, and *daf-21* are not changed by heat shock, these molecules may be regulated at the posttranslational level to export YAP-1 (Suppl. Fig. 7).

Extra amounts of YAP-1 have a beneficial effect on thermotolerance, while higher YAP-1 activity has a deleterious effect on heat response

To identify the physiological consequences of losing *yap-1* function, we analyzed the phenotype of *yap-1* mutant animals. The *yap-1(tm1416)* lacks the WW domain, which should be a loss-of-function mutation, if not a null mutation (Suppl. Fig. 8). The mutant did not exhibit any remarkable phenotype under the conventional growth condition at 20°C or at 25°C, except the protruding vulva phenotype. Given that YAP-1::GFP translocates in response to heat shock, we assessed the effect of *yap-1* mutation on thermosensitivity. In following experiments, worms of interest were grown at 35°C and were scored for touch-provoked movement and pharyngeal pumping. Worms failing to display either trait were scored as dead (Suppl. Table 1). *yap-1(tm1416)* mutants resulted in a significant increase in thermo-sensitivity (Fig. 6A). Using transgenic lines expressing YAP-1::GFP, we examined the effect of exogenous YAP-1 on thermotolerance. Two independent lines were capable to confer higher thermotolerance than the control line (Fig. 6B). These results suggest that YAP-1 has a beneficial effect on thermotolerance. *egl-44* (RNAi) partially cancels the effect of YAP-1::GFP (Suppl. Fig. 9). This result implies that EGL-44 functions downstream of YAP-1 to regulate thermotolerance. To test whether nuclear translocation of YAP-1 increases high thermotolerance, animals were treated with either *wts-1(RNAi)* or *ftt-2(RNAi)* bacteria at 20°C for 1 day, and were shifted at 35°C. Surprisingly, both RNAi treatments reduced thermotolerance, compared with control RNAi treatment (Fig. 6C). These results suggest that excessive YAP-1 activity has a deleterious effect on heat response or that the ratio of cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP-1 may be important. We next tested whether YAP-1 is required as a critical downstream executor for *wts-1(RNAi)* or *ftt-2(RNAi)* thermosensitive phenotype. Neither *wts-1 (RNAi)* nor *ftt-2 (RNAi)* altered an intrinsic thermotolerance in *yap-1(tm1416)* mutants, suggesting that *wts-1* and *ftt-2* knockdown effects are *yap-1*-dependent (Fig. 6D). To determine further which intervention of YAP-1 is dominant for thermal phenotype, we addressed the combinatorial analysis of exogenous YAP-1 expression with either *wts-1(RNAi)* or *ftt-2(RNAi)*. Both gene inactivations resulted in a decrease of intrinsic thermotolerance in the *yap-1::gfp* transgenic line (Fig. 6E). The data suggest that *wts-1(RNAi)* or *ftt-2(RNAi)*, which is expected to increase the nuclear YAP-1, impairs the thermotolerance caused by overexpression of YAP-1. All these findings imply that the appropriate amount and activity of YAP-1 is important for the thermotolerance.

HSF-1 and HSP-90 are required for efficient nuclear export of YAP-1 after heat shock

Heat shock proteins (HSPs) play important roles in the nuclear export of transcription factors such as DAF-16 [42]. We next examined whether and how heat shock proteins regulate the nuclear export of YAP-1. *C. elegans* genome has predicted more than twenty heat shock proteins (www.wormbase.org). The transcriptions of these genes are regulated by heat shock transcription factor, HSF-1 [43]. *hsf-1* inactivation by RNAi significantly suppressed the nuclear export of YAP-1 after transient temporal heat shock, while control RNAi did not (Fig. 5A and D). We subsequently tested which HSP(s) is herein important. We subjected RNAi to suppress HSPs, whose transcriptions are regulated by HSF-1. Among small HSPs (*hsp-16.1, hsp-16.41, hsp-16.48, hsp-25, sip-1*), Hsp70s (*hsp-1, C30C11.4, hsp-70*), and Hsp90 (*daf-21*), only *daf-21* depletion inhibited the nuclear export of YAP-1 during heat shock recovery (Fig. 5B, C, and E–K, and Table 2). None of RNAi treatments for HSF-1 and HSPs caused the nuclear accumulation of YAP-1::GFP under the conventional growth at 20°C (Suppl. Fig. 6). It makes sharp contrast to the nuclear localization of YAP-1 observed under either inactivation of *wts-1* or *ftt-2* (Fig. 3B and C). These results suggest that HSF-1 and DAF-21 are involved in the step of nuclear export but not import of YAP-1. Under the knockdown of *wts-1* or *ftt-2*, YAP-1 remained in nuclei after heat shock (data not shown). Therefore, WTS-1 and FTT-2 are necessary for the nuclear export of YAP-1 during the recovery post heat shock. As

Yap-1 deficiency promotes healthy aging in *Caenorhabditis elegans*

YAP-1::GFP distribution was observed in *yap-1::GFP* animals at 20 °C, immediately after heat shock at 35 °C for 3 h (0 h), and after recovery for 1 h, 6 h, and 12 h (E).

YAP-1::GFP distribution was observed at 20 °C after recovery for 12 h. All knockdowns of HSPs without heat shock had no effect on YAP-1::GFP distribution (Suppl. Fig. 3). Arrowheads indicate the position of nuclear YAP-1::GFP. Scale bars are 10 micrometer.

better in both *yap-1(tm1416)* mutation and *yap-1* RNAi at middle life (Fig. 7D).

Promotion of healthy aging by *yap-1* deficiency is independent of *daf-16* and the EGF pathway

Mammalian YAP potentiates both insulin receptor (InsR) and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signals [48,49]. In *C. elegans*, InsR and EGFR signals are involved in healthy aging [16,46,47]. In the final set of experiments, we investigated the genetic interaction of YAP-1 and both healthspan signaling pathways. As the longevity phenotype of InsR/*daf-2(rf)* mutants is suppressed by *daf-16* null mutation [47,50], we addressed whether *daf-16* mutation prevents the extension of healthspan in *yap-1* deficient animals. *yap-1* RNAi improved the healthspan expectancy in the null mutation of *daf-16(mgDF50)* as well as in the wild type animals (Fig. 7E). The knockdown of phosphoinositide-3-kinase ortholog (*age-1*) caused robust nuclear localization of DAF-16::GFP, but neither *yap-1(tm1416)* nor *yap-1RNAi* did (Suppl. Fig. 11). These findings support that *yap-1* knockdown effect is *daf-16*-independent. Likewise, *yap-1* RNAi exhibited beneficial effects on swimming healthspan in the

temperature-sensitive reduction-of-function of the EGFR mutant let-23(n1045), in which the EGF signaling is impaired at 20 °C (Fig. 7F). Therefore, beneficial *yap-1* knockdown effects do not require the upstream EGF signaling.

### Discussion

Mammalian YAP was originally identified as a protein interacting with yes tyrosine kinase, which has one or two WW domains and a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif. Mammalian genome harbors another YAP-related gene, TAZ/WWTR1, which has a similar molecular structure [6,23]. YAP and TAZ interact with the TEAD proteins via the N-terminal region, and with other transcriptional factors such as SMAD proteins via WW domains [24,36–38]. The N-terminal TEAD-binding domain of YAP is composed of two α helices (α1 and α2) and one β strand (β1), which form the interfaces between YAP and TEAD [51]. *C. elegans* genome seems to have only one YAP-related gene, F13E6.4. The interaction study using heterologous cells supports that F13E6.4 protein binds EGL-44, a TEAD homolog, and that the WW domain of F13E6.4 protein interacts with the WW-domain-interacting motif. These findings support that F13E6.4 protein has functional TEAD-binding and WW domains. Therefore, we designated F13E6.4 gene product as YAP-1. In the reporter assay using heterologous mammalian cells, EGL-44 alone or YAP-1 alone does not activate the TEAD-responsive reporter, whereas the co-expression of EGL-44 and YAP-1 does. High thermotolerance caused by expressing YAP-1::GFP is partially cancelled by silencing of *egl-44*. These findings suggest that the interaction between YAP-1 and EGL-44 is functional.

Mammalian YAP and Drosophila Yorkie are negatively regulated by the tumor suppressive Hippo pathway [5,6]. The pathway is composed of the upstream regulators (cell adhesion molecules and membrane-associated proteins) and the core kinase cascade [1–4]. In mammals, MST1/2 activate LATS1/2, which in turn phosphorylate YAP/TAZ at multiple sites. The phosphorylations trigger YAP/TAZ recruitment from nuclei to cytoplasm through the binding to 14-3-3 and turns off YAP/TAZ-dependent gene transcriptions. Thus, the suppression of the Hippo pathway components or 14-3-3 induces the nuclear accumulation of YAP/TAZ. We confirmed that *wts-1* and *ftt-2* knockdowns result in the nuclear localization of YAP-1, suggesting that the localization of YAP-1 is regulated in a similar manner to that shown for YAP/TAZ. In mammals, the phosphorylation at S127 of YAP is a major determinant of its subcellular localization. YAP has additional four LATS1/2-mediated phosphorylation sites,

but the single mutation at S127 can constitutively, even if not fully, activate YAP. In contrast, the replacement of S104 with alanine, which corresponds to S127 of YAP, failed to accumulate YAP-1 in nuclei. Intriguingly, under the suppression of *wts-1* or *ftt-2*, YAP-1 S104A was accumulated in nuclei. This finding that the nuclear accumulation of YAP-1 S104A depends on both of WTS-1 and FTT-2 suggests that YAP-1 is phosphorylated by WTS-1 at other site(s) than at S104, which generates additional FTT-2 binding site(s), and that the phosphorylated YAP-1 S104A is segregated by FTT-2 in cytoplasm. However, no canonical consensus sequence for 14-3-3 binding can be found in YAP-1 S104A, which implies that FTT-2 recognizes a different non-canonical sequence. In mammals, the phosphorylations by LATS1/2 facilitate not only the cytoplasmic localization but also the degradation of YAP/TAZ [52]. It is not clear whether YAP-1 degradation is regulated in a similar manner. Silencing of *wts-1* appears to slightly attenuate YAP-1 expression. Heat shock, which accumulates YAP-1 into the nucleus, also decreases the total expression of YAP-1. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the regulation of YAP-1 stability.

The components of the Hippo pathway such as MOB1, MST1/2, Sav1, RASSF1A, Expanded, and Merlin, are conserved in C. elegans as F09A5.4, cst-1, cst-2, sav-1, rsf-1, frm-7, and nfm-1, respectively. If these gene products form the Hippo pathway in C. elegans, their knockdowns should change YAP-1 localization. However, the knockdowns of these genes did not cause the nuclear accumulation of YAP-1. Although it is a matter of debate whether Akt kinases directly phosphorylate YAP, it is proposed that the Akt-dependent phosphorylation enables YAP to bind to 14-3-3 and eventually recruits it to cytoplasm [27]. Recent studies have revealed that actin cytoskeleton and AMOT proteins also regulate the subcellular localization of YAP in mammals [28–33]. We performed the knockdowns of the orthologs of these genes, which are potentially involved in the regulation of YAP-1, but could not observe any effect on YAP-1 localization. There remains the possibility that the genes were not completely suppressed in our experiments, but overall, these findings rather support that WTS-1 and FTT-2 regulate YAP-1, but that YAP-1 localization is independent of orthologs of other molecules that regulate mammalian YAP.

During this study, we found that heat shock causes the nuclear recruitment of YAP-1 in the hypodermis in adult animals. The immunoblottings of egg lysates suggest that heat shock also increases the unphosphorylated nuclear YAP-1 in eggs. The reason why heat shock-induced YAP-1 translocation is not remarkable in other adult tissues is not clear. It might be due to the tissue-dependent expressions of molecules that determine the subcellular localization of YAP-1. Temperature alteration activates not only the nuclear import but also the nuclear export of YAP-1. The nuclear export of YAP-1 requires heat shock transcription factor HSF-1 and DAF-21, a homolog of HSP90. The nuclear export of YAP-1 by HSF-1 and DAF-21 may need to prevent excessive response to the heat shock. Interestingly, In mammals, HSP90 inhibition reduces LATS1/2 and inactivates them [53]. Although we did not examine whether DAF-21 depletion affects WTS-1 expression and its activity, the regulation of YAP by HSP90 might be conserved in C. elegans.

The knockout mice of YAP are embryonic lethal [54]. The overexpression and the hyperactivity of YAP lead to oncogenesis [5,6]. In C. elegans, we did not observe remarkable phenotypes related to YAP-1 at conventional growth condition. However, we observed that the extra amount of YAP-1 has a beneficial effect on thermotolerance and yap-1 (tm1416) mutation enhances the susceptibility to thermal stress, whereas the higher YAP-1 activity induced by wts-1 or ftt-2 knockdown has a deleterious effect on heat response. As silencing of egl-44 suppresses high thermotolerance induced by overexpression of YAP-1::GFP and EGL-44 is localized in the nucleus, we speculated that the nuclear YAP-1 is important for thermotolerance [12]. Hence we expected that wts-1 (RNAi) and ftt-2 (RNAi) should enhance thermotolerance. Contrary to our expectation, silencing of wts-1 or ftt-2 impaired thermotolerance in wild animals and YAP-1::GFP-expressing animals. Silencing of wts-1 or ftt-2 did not show additional deleterious effect in animals with yap-1 (tm1416) mutation. These findings suggest that the proper activity of YAP-1 or the ratio of cytoplasmic and nuclear YAP-1 may be important. We also speculate that the translocation of YAP-1 at appropriate timing, which results in the transient activation followed by the shut off, is important.


Stress resistance is expected to be beneficial for health aging in animals. We hypothesized that YAP-1 overexpression results in extended life span. However, transgenic yap-1::GFP lines showed shorter life span, whereas yap-1 deficiency confers healthy aging independently of well-characterized aging pathways, Insulin/IGF and EGF signals, in C. elegans. Therefore, stress resistance mediated by YAP-1 does not confer benefits against aging. These phenotypes are at a glance inconsistent with each other. By analogy with YAP, YAP-1 is considered to interact with various transcriptional factors in a cell and tissue context-dependent manner. We speculate that YAP-1 bestows stress resistance in early life but may have deleterious effects on aging in later life and that YAP-1 may function as an antagonistic pleiotropic factor [55,56].

In conclusion, YAP-1 localization is regulated by WTS-1, FTT-2, and DAF-21, and is implicated in stress response and healthlife span. Although we could not find evidence that the Hippo pathway is conserved in C. elegans and the function of YAP-1 looks like to be different from that of YAP, YAP-1 partially shares the basal character with YAP and can be regarded as a candidate for C. elegans YAP ortholog.
