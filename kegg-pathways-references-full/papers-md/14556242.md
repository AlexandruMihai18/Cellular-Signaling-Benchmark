In the hedgehog signaling network, mutations result in various phenotypes, including, among others, holoprosencephaly, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, Pallister-Hall syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, isolated basal cell carcinoma, and medulloblastoma. Active Hedgehog ligand is double lipid modified with a C-terminal cholesterol moiety and an N-terminal palmitate. Transport active Hedgehog from the signaling cell to the responding cell occurs through three mechanisms: 1). formation of multimeric Hedgehog which makes it soluble; 2). function of Dispatched in releasing the lipid-anchored protein from the signaling cell; and 3). movement across the plasma membrane of the responding cell by Tout-velu-dependent synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycan. In the responding cell, active Hedgehog binds to its receptor Patched, a 12-pass transmembrane protein, which frees Smoothened, an adjacent 7-pass transmembrane protein, for downstream signaling. Patched and Smoothened may shuttle oppositely between the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles in response to active Hedgehog ligand. In downstream signaling, Cubitus interruptus (Gli proteins in vertebrates), Costal 2, Fused, and Suppressor of Fused form a tetrameric complex. Cubitus interruptus is a bifunctional transcription regulator. In the absence of active Hedgehog ligand, a truncated transcriptional repressor is generated that binds target genes and blocks their transcription. In the presence of active Hedgehog ligand, a full length transcriptional activator binds target genes and upregulates their transcription. Target genes include Wingless (Wnt gene family in vertebrates), Decapentaplegic

(Bone Morphogenetic Proteins in vertebrates), and Patched. The upregulation of Patched expression, resulting in Patched protein at the cell membrane, sequesters Hedgehog and limits its spread beyond the cells in which it is produced. Thus, a balance is created by the antagonism of Hedgehog and Patched, whose relative concentrations alternate with respect to each other. Many more factors that are essential for the hedgehog signaling network are also discussed: Megalin, Rab23, Hip, GAS1, PKA, GSK3, CK1, Slimb, SAP18, and CBP.

## INTRODUCTION

Members of the hedgehog family of secreted proteins act on intercellular signals in a host of different processes. Hedgehog (*Hh*; human homologues including *Sonic Hedgehog* or *SHH*) genes play a key role in embryonic patterning. Nüsslein-Volhard and Wieschaus [1980], in screening for mutations that disrupt the *Drosophila* larval body plan, identified several that resulted in duplication of the bristles; their projection from the

larval cuticle suggested the spines of a hedgehog to the authors.

The term “hedgehog signaling pathway” is most commonly used. However, the “pathway” is so complex, and such strikingly different phenotypes can result from various types of mutations (Table I), the term “hedgehog signaling network” seems more appropriate. Phenotypes include, among others, holoprosencephaly, nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, Greig cephalopolysyndactyly, Pallister-Hall syndrome, Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome, isolated basal cell carcinoma, and medulloblastoma [Cohen, 1999]. Additional phenotypes possibly include multiple exostoses and VACTERL. One target gene upregulates a pathway involved in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC).

The hedgehog signaling network has been reviewed by Hahn et al. [1999], Ingham and McMahon [2001], Ho and Scott [2002], Mullor et al. [2002], Nybakken and Perrimon [2002], Bale [2002], Ruiz i Altaba et al. [2002], and Roessler and Muenke [2003].

The hedgehog signaling network is illustrated in Figures 1, 2 (*Drosophila* genes; human homologues in parentheses), and 3. Table II lists some human genes in the network, their chromosome map locations, and their expression patterns.

A general description of the signaling network is presented first. An analysis of each component follows. The last section deals with mutations, gene overexpression, and teratogens that involve the hedgehog signaling network and cholesterol biosynthesis in animals.

## GENERAL DESCRIPTION OF THE SIGNALING NETWORK

Although great progress has been made in understanding the hedgehog signaling network, many uncertainties remain to be elucidated in the future. A speculative model of interactions within and between signaling and responding cells is shown in Figure 2.

Four features of the hedgehog signaling network are highly unusual. First, autoprocessing generates an active Hedgehog ligand with a C-terminal cholesterol moiety. Then palmitoylation results in an N-terminal palmitate. Thus, the active Hedgehog ligand becomes double lipid-modified (Fig. 4).

Second, most membrane-bound receptors activate downstream signaling on ligand binding. In contrast, patched is repressed by its Hedgehog ligand, freeing Smoothened for downstream signaling (Fig. 1).

Third, Patched (Fig. 5) and Smoothened may shuttle oppositely between the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles in response to Hedgehog ligand (Fig. 2). They may not interact physically, Patched acting catalytically rather than stoichiometrically [Denef et al., 2000; Ingham et al., 2000; Taipale et al., 2002]. In contrast, Incardona et al. [2002] suggested that Patched and Smoothened colocalize in the absence of Hedgehog and that both proteins endocytose on ligand binding after which Smoothened subsequently segregates from the Patched/Hedgehog complex.

Fourth, the network has a bifunctional transcription regulator, Cubitus interruptus (Fig. 6). In the absence of Hedgehog ligand, a truncated transcriptional repressor is generated that binds target genes and blocks their transcription (Fig. 3). In the presence of Hedgehog ligand, a full-length transcriptional activator binds target genes and upregulates their transcription (Fig. 3).

Hedgehog is capable of both short- and long-range signaling. It is highly regulated at many levels. Cholesterol-modified Hedgehog, which should be tethered to the cell membrane, can be further modified at the lipid rafts where it multimerizes and becomes soluble and diffusable [Zeng et al., 2001]. Dispatched functions to release multimeric Hedgehog, making it available for long-range signaling [Burke et al., 1999] (Fig. 2).

The movement of multimeric Hedgehog is also regulated by Tout-velu-dependent synthesis of heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) [Bellaiche et al., 1998]. One possibility is that HSPG presents multimeric Hedgehog to its Patched receptor in a fashion similar to HSPG in FGF signaling. Perhaps it targets multimeric Hedgehog specifically to endocytic vesicles. Another possibility is that HSPG allows Hedgehog to move from cell to cell (Fig. 2).

Besides Patched, Megalin can also bind Hedgehog with high affinity [McCarthy et al., 2002]. Perhaps Megalin-mediated endocytosis of multimeric Hedgehog may regulate its availability to Patched by competing with Patched to limit the levels of multimeric Hedgehog. Alternatively, Megalin may deliver multimeric Hedgehog to vesicular pools of Patched (Fig. 2).

Hedgehog Interacting Protein and Growth Arrest Specific 1 may both attenuate Hedgehog signaling [Chuang and McMahon, 1999; Lee et al., 2001] (Fig. 2).

Multimeric Hedgehog and Patched colocalize in subcellular vesicles [Incardona et al., 2000b] (Fig. 2). Whether Patched eventually separates from Hedgehog with Hedgehog being directed to lysosomes for degradation and with the Patched returning to the cell surface is unclear at present.

Patched is also a target gene in the hedgehog signaling network (Fig. 2). The upregulation of Patched expression, resulting in Patched protein at the cell membrane, sequesters Hedgehog and limits its spread beyond the cells in which it is produced [Chen and Struhl, 1996]. Thus, a balance is created by the antagonism of Hedgehog and Patched, whose relative concentrations alternate with respect to each other [Cohen, 1999].

# ANALYSIS OF COMPONENTS

## Hedgehog Genes

Unlike one Hedgehog gene found in *Drosophila* (*Hh*), three Hedgehog genes, first identified in the mouse, are found in vertebrates. These include Desert hedgehog (*Dhh*), Indian hedgehog (*Ihh*), and Sonic hedgehog (*Shh*).<sup>a</sup> *Dhh* is most closely related to *Hh*; *Ihh* and *Shh* are more closely related to each other and represent a more recent gene duplication. Further duplications

<sup>a</sup>The term is named after “Sonic, the Hedgehog,” a computer game played by children. Sonic has two closely-set eyes with a common scleral rim, suggesting holoprosencephaly. The murine null mutation (*Shh<sup>−/−</sup>*) demonstrates holoprosencephaly.

${}^{a}$ To date, the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome has not been reported with mutations in $PTCH2$, $SHH$, $SMO$, or $GLI1$, but there are reasons for believing that such mutations might rarely be possible in the syndrome [see Cohen, 1999]. $PTCH2$ has been reported with a mutation in a medulloblastoma by Smyth et al. [1999]. Medulloblastoma is a feature of the nevoid basal cell carcinoma in about 3–5% of cases. A mutation in $SHH$ has been found in one isolated basal cell carcinoma [Oro et al., 1997], although this association has been questioned [Wicking et al., 1998]. However, Oro et al. [1997] showed that basal cell carcinomas and skeletal malformations were found in hypersonic transgenic mice. Mutations in $SMO$ have been reported in isolated basal cell carcinomas [Reifenberger et al., 1998; Xie et al., 1998]. Dahmane et al. [1997] found unambiguous expression of $GLI1$ in almost all isolated basal cell carcinomas studied.

${}^{b}$ Mutations in $CBP$ have been found in Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome by Petrij et al. [1995] and Blough et al. [2000]. $CBP$ enhances transcription mediated by many other transcription factors. However, Akimaru et al. [1997] have shown that $Drosophila CBP (dCBP)$ functions as a co-activator of $cubitus interruptus$, which is part of the hedgehog network.

${}^{c}$ Goodrich et al. [1997] found that mice lacking a functional copy of the $Ptch$ gene developed medulloblastomas frequently.

${}^{d}$ Most reported meningiomas in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome are secondary to radiation treatment for medulloblastomas. However, a few examples of true meningioma have been observed. Xie et al. [1997] noted an isolated meningioma with a $PTCH$ mutation.

${}^{e}$ These tumors are rare in the nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome and no syndrome case to date with a $PTCH$ mutation has been recorded with them. However, in the $Ptch$ mouse model of the syndrome, rhabdomyosarcomas have been reported [Hahn et al., 1998].

HEDGEHOG ABSENT                      HEDGEHOG PRESENT

Sonic Hedgehog (Shh)

Sonic hedgehog (Shh) gene expression has been demonstrated in the floorplate of the neural tube. Targeted gene disruption in the mouse produces cyclopia with absence of ventral neural tube cells. The Shh mutation is recessive, resulting in a severe phenotype [Chiang et al., 1996]. In contrast to the mouse, human SHH mutations are heterozygous, and the holoprosencephalic phenotype is more variable [Belloni et al., 1996; Roessler et al., 1996, 1997; Nanni et al., 1999].

Autoprocessing Reaction. SHH has an N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (SHH-C) that causes autocleavage of the protein, producing an ester-linked cholesterol moiety at the carboxy-terminal end of SHH-N. The autocleavage of SHH proceeds via a thioester intermediate that undergoes a nucleophilic attack by cholesterol, resulting in a covalently-linked cholesterol adduct and activation of the SHH-N signaling portion. The SHH-C catalytic portion diffuses away [Porter et al., 1996] (Fig. 4).

Fig. 1. Classical model for regulation of Smo activity by Ptch and Hh. Both Ptch and Smo are membrane bound. Ptch inhibits Smo when Hedgehog is absent. Hedgehog modified by palmitate (PAL) and cholesterol (CHOL) binds to Ptch, inducing a conformational change, freeing Smo for downstream signaling. Hh-N, autoprocessed N-terminal signaling domain.

Phylogenetic relationships in the vertebrate Hedgehog gene family [Zardoya et al., 1996] are shown in Figure 7. Human hedgehog genes (SHH, IHH, and DHH), their chromosome map locations, and their expression patterns are summarized in Table II.


![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)


Fig. 2. Hedgehog signaling network; a speculative model of interactions within and between signaling and responding cells. *Drosophila* genes are shown with human homologues in parentheses. Signaling cell: Autoprocessing generates an N-terminal signaling domain Hh-N with a C-terminal cholesterol moiety (Hh-NC). Then palmitoylation results in an N-terminal palmitate (P-Hh-NC). Cholesterol-modified Hedgehog can be further modified at the lipid rafts where it multimerizes and becomes soluble and diffusible. Disp functions to release multimeric Hedgehog (M), making it available for long-range signaling. Responding cell: The movement of multimeric Hedgehog is regulated by Ttv-dependent synthesis of HSPG. One possibility is that HSPG presents multimeric Hedgehog to Ptch. Besides Ptch, Megalin can also bind multimeric Hedgehog. Without Hedgehog ligand binding, Ptch inhibits Smo from downstream signaling. Ptch and Smo shuttle oppositely between the plasma membrane and endocytic vesicles in response to Hedgehog binding to Ptch. Ptch and Smo do not interact physically. Ptch acts catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. Ci is a bifunctional transcription regulator. In the absence of Hedgehog ligand, a truncated transcriptional repressor (Rep-Ci) is generated that binds target genes (*Ptch*, *Wg*, *Dpp*) and blocks their transcription. In the presence of Hedgehog ligand, a full-length transcriptional activator (Act-Ci) binds target genes and upregulates their transcription. For further details about Ci's role as a transcriptional regulator, see Figure 3. For details about Megalin, Hip, GAS1, Rab23, Slimb, and SAP18, see text. In this diagram, the N-terminal signaling portion of Hedgehog is not truncated because it would be too small for use in the diagram. See Figure 4 for autoprocessing and palmitoylation of SHH.

Fig. 3. Left: In downstream signaling, Ci, Cos2, Fu, and Sufu form a tetrameric complex which results in the nuclear transcription and activity of Ci. In the absence of Hedgehog stimulation, the complex is tethered to the microtubules by Cos2. Both Cos2 and Sufu retain Ci in the cytoplasm, the former being bound to Ci's CORD domain and the latter being bound to its Sufu domain. Cos2 promotes proteolysis of Ci, generating the truncated 75 kDa repressor form of Ci (Rep-Ci). The process requires phosphorylation of Ci by dPKA, CK1, and Sgg, and also the activities of Slimb, Sufu, and SAP18. Translocation of Rep-Ci to the nucleus prevents transcription of target genes Ptch, Wg, and Dpp. Right: With intermediate levels of Hedgehog stimulation, the Ci, Cos2, Fu, Sufu complex dissociates from the microtubules, inhibiting the cleavage of Ci, possibly through dephosphorylation of Ci. The full length 155 kDa activator form of Ci (Act-Ci) binds to Sufu, an interaction that restricts its nuclear translocation. Sufu attenuates its transcriptional activity. Higher levels of Hedgehog stimulation promote dissociation of Sufu from Act-Ci, which together with cofactor dCBP upregulates target genes Ptch, Wg, and Dpp.

Fig. 4. Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) has an N-terminal signaling domain (SHH-N) and a C-terminal catalytic domain (SHH-C) that causes autocleavage of the protein, resulting in an ester-linked cholesterol moiety (CHOL) at the carboxy-terminal end of the signaling portion; the catalytic portion diffuses away. An amide-linked amino-terminal palmitate (PAL) is critical for signaling activity. Following the addition of the carboxy-terminal cholesterol adduct, palmitoylation requires the action of Skinny hedgehog (Ski) acyltransferase.

signaling. SIX3 [Wallis et al., 1999] has not been linked to any of these interrelated pathways to date.

### Mechanisms of Hedgehog Protein Transport

The ester-linked cholesterol moiety and the amide-linked palmitate should tether the Shh signaling portion to the plasma membrane of the producing cell. However, transport to responding cells can occur through three mechanisms: (1) formation of multimeric Hedgehog [Zeng et al., 2001]; (2) function of Dispatched (Disp) in releasing the lipid-anchored protein [Burke et al., 1999; Ma et al., 2002]; and (3) diffusion of the protein by Tousled (Ttv) [Bellaiche et al., 1998; The et al., 1999] (Fig. 2).

#### Multimeric Hedgehog (M-Hh-N, M-Shh-N)

Zeng et al. [2001] demonstrated a soluble and diffusable form of double lipid-modified Shh that is multimeric and biologically potent. They suggested that modified Shh might be formed at the lipid rafts where it multimerizes with its lipid attachments sequestered in the interior of the multimer. This soluble form could then diffuse from its producing cell, making it available for long-range signaling (Fig. 2). The multimeric form of Hedgehog will be abbreviated as either M-Hh-N or M-Shh-N.

#### Dispatched (Disp)

Burke et al. [1999] identified a 12-pass transmembrane protein, Dispatched (Disp), with sequence similarity to *Drosophila* and vertebrate Ptch. Disp has ubiquitous early embryonic expression with some tissue-specific variations in level. Human DISP maps to 1q42 [Ma et al., 2002]. Although both Disp and Ptch have sterol sensing domains, they play opposite roles (Fig. 5). Disp functions to release cholesterol-modified Hh from its tether to the plasma membrane, making it available for long-range signaling (Fig. 2). However, the precise mechanism by which this is accomplished remains unknown to date [Burke et al., 1999]. Zeng et al. [2001] speculated that Disp might be involved

#### Mutations in Sonic Hedgehog Signaling Network and Linked Pathways

Known human mutations for holoprosencephaly are summarized in Table III. Because various pathways are linked to the sonic hedgehog signaling network, the mutations are interrelated [Muenke and Beachy, 2001] (Fig. 8). *SHH* [Belloni et al., 1996; Roessler et al., 1996, 1997; Nanni et al., 1999], *PTCH* [Ming et al., 2002], and *GLI2* [Roessler et al., 2002] are within the sonic hedgehog signaling network itself. *DHCR7* [Wassif et al., 1998; Witsch-Baumgartner et al., 2000; Yu et al., 2000] involves 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase in cholesterol biosynthesis. *ZIC2* [Brown et al., 1998, 2001] and *GLI2* are related; Gli proteins are translocated to cell nuclei by coexpressed Zic proteins [Brewster et al., 1998; Koyabu et al., 2001]. *TDGF1* [de la Cruz et al., 2002], *TGIF* [Gripp et al., 2000], and *FAST1* [Ouspenskaia et al., 2002] involve Nodal/TGFβ

b Besides Skinny hedgehog (Ski), other terms for the same acyltransferase are known, such as rasp, sightless (sit), and central missing (cnn) [Amanai et al., 2001; Lee and Treisman, 2001].

in packaging multimeric and soluble Shh protein or targeting it to the lipid rafts.

Ma et al. [2002] noted that Disp showed sequence similarity to the prokaryotic RND permease superfamily. These superfamily proteins are known to function as proton-driven anterporters. They have a conserved GxxxD motif in the middle of TM4 and an aspartic acid residue within this motif, which is important as a proton-binding site. Disp has three aspartic acid residues, suggesting the possibility that Disp and bacterial proteins might act by a similar mechanism.

Tout-velu (Ttv). Bellaiche et al. [1998] characterized a 760 amino acid protein that mediates movement of M-Hh-N across responding cells. They identified mutants in the gene which they called Tout-velu (Ttv), meaning “all hair” because of their “hairy” appearance. Ttv is closely related to the EXT gene family involved in human multiple exostoses. It is more homologous to EXT2 with 44% protein identity than to EXT1 with 26% protein identity [The et al., 1999]. EXT proteins are implicated in heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) biosynthesis. EXT1 and EXT2 are glycosyltransferases required for the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate [Lind et al., 1998; McCormick et al., 1998]. For example, in EXT2, a GalNAc transferase determines a heparan sulfate chain (instead of a chondroitin sulfate chain) attached to the linker region of HSPG [Kitagawa et al., 1999; Simmons et al., 1999].

The movement of M-Hh-N is regulated by Ttv-dependent synthesis of HSPG. One possibility is that HSPG may present M-Hh-N to its receptor Ptch in a fashion similar to HSPG in FGF signaling; perhaps it targets M-Hh-N specifically to endocytotic vesicles

In an earlier paper by this group [Bellaiche et al., 1998], Ttv is said to be 56% identical to EXT1 and 25% identical to EXT2.

(Fig. 2). If so, “just a spoonful of sugar helps the signal go down.” Another possibility is that HSPG allows M-Hh-N to move from cell to cell.

### Patched (Ptch, Ptch1)

The symbols for Patched are Ptc and PTC. Recently, Ptch and PTCH have been used by some authors and there are compelling reasons for continuing this trend. The ability to taste phenylthiocarbamide is genetically controlled, and numerous articles, beginning as early as 1931, refer to this as PTC [OMIM 171200; Kim et al., 2003]; the genetic term PTC for this has been well known to human geneticists for years.

Patched (Ptch) encodes a transmembrane protein that acts as a negative regulator of hedgehog (Hh) signaling. The 1500 amino acid glycoprotein has 12 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, intracellular amino- and carboxy-terminal regions, and two large hydrophilic extracellular loops where Hh ligand binding occurs [Hooper and Scott, 1989; Marigo et al., 1996] (Fig. 5).

Ptch has dual roles in sequestering and transducing Hh [Chen and Struhl, 1996]. When the second large extracellular loop, essential for ligand binding, is deleted by a Ptch mutation, Hh binding to Ptch cannot occur, but Ptch’s repression of Smo is unaffected [Briscoe et al., 2001]. When a C-terminal truncation is caused by a Ptch mutation, Ptch can no longer repress Smo, but Hh binding to Ptch is unaffected [Johnson et al., 2000].

Helms et al. [1997] demonstrated that retinoic acid inhibited both Shh and Ptch expressions in the craniofacial primordia of chick embryos; the polarizing activity in these tissues was abolished. These findings are of particular interest because human mutations in both SHH [Roessler et al., 1996, 1997; Nanni et al., 1999] and PTCH [Ming et al., 2002] have been shown to cause holoprosencephaly.

four rare PTCH missense mutations have resulted in holoprosencephaly—two in the extracellular loops required for SHH binding and two in the intracellular loops that may be involved in PTCH-SMO interaction [Ming et al., 2002].

**Patched 2 (Ptch2).** A second gene, *Ptch2*, has been detected in the adult mouse eye. In humans, *PTCH2* maps to 1p32-p34 and encodes a 1204 amino acid protein. PTCH2 has a 54% overall identity to PTCH

Human *PTCH*, a tumor suppressor gene, maps to 9q22.3. Mutations in *PTCH* have been identified in patients with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, isolated basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, meningioma, neuroectodermal tumor, breast carcinoma, esophageal carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and trichoepithelioma [Cohen, 1999] (Table I). Most mutations have resulted in protein truncation. However,

The amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of Patched 2 are different from Patched 1, including the absence of 150 amino acid residues in the C-terminal domain of Patched 2. Two large extracellular loops are for Hedgehog ligand binding. Dispatched functions to release cholesterol modified Hedgehog from its tether to the plasma membrane, making it available for long range signaling. The sterol-sensing domain (SSD) is shown with hatched cylinders enclosed within a rectangle formed with dashed lines.

and a 90% identity to Ptch2 in mice [Carpenter et al., 1998]. The Ptch2 protein also contains 12 transmembrane domains and two large extracellular loops. However, both amino- and carboxy-terminal regions are different from Ptch (Ptch1), including the absence of 150 amino-acid residues in the C-terminal domain (Fig. 5).

Ptc and Ptc2 are differentially expressed during development of the epidermis, suggesting that the two proteins may have different functions [Motoyama et al., 1998; Smyth et al., 1999], although the function of Ptc2 remains unclear to date (see Table II for expression patterns of PTCH and PTCH2).

have been reported in medulloblastoma and basal cell carcinoma [Smyth et al., 1999].

**Translocation in Renal Cell Carcinoma 8 (TRC8).** Translocation in Renal Cell Carcinoma 8 (TRC8) is a 664 amino acid 10-pass transmembrane protein with some similarities to PTCH; it maps to 8q24. In a series of sporadic renal cell carcinomas, a TRC8 mutation was identified and Gemmill et al. [1998] suggested that TRC8 may define an additional pathway of mutations resulting in renal and thyroid carcinomas.

Amino acids 344–443 in TRC8 have a 60% identity to amino acids 883–979 in PTCH, which corresponds to the second large extracellular loop of PTCH involved in SHH binding. Another similarity, a sterol sensing domain between amino acids 22–179 in TRC8 has a 63% identity to the sterol sensing domain between amino acids 440–600 in PTCH. TRC8 transcripts are expressed in many tissues, including the testis, placenta, adrenal, kidney, and thyroid [Gemmill et al., 1998].

**Sterol Sensing Domain (SSD).** Ptch, Ptch2, and Disp each have a sterol-sensing domain (SSD) consisting of approximately 180 amino acids that make up five membrane-spanning domains (Fig. 5). SSD-containing proteins, such as HMGCR, SCAP, NPC1, and 7DHCR, play key roles in different aspects of cholesterol homeostasis or cholesterol-linked signaling. They share common properties such as rapid trafficking between organelles, cargo transport, and modification of their activity by sterol and/or lipoprotein concentrations [Kuwabara and Labouesse, 2002].

The SSD of Ptch is essential for its activity, but its role remains unclear to date. The hypothesis that the SSD of Ptch plays a role in targeting cholesterol-modified Hh is not supported because absence of the cholesterol adduct does not alter the affinity of Ptch for Hh [Pepinsky et al., 1998]. Mutations in the SSD of Ptch in *Drosophila* do not interfere with Hh binding [Martin et al., 2001; Strutt et al., 2001], but cholesterol does affect the potency and range of Hh movement, and the same is true for Shh movement in vertebrates [Chen and Struhl, 1996; Marigo et al., 1996; Stone et al., 1996; Lewis et al., 2001]. In *Drosophila*, Ptch cannot effectively sequester Hh without the cholesterol adduct, which results in an extended range of Hh signaling [Chen and Struhl, 1996; Burke et al., 1999]. In contrast, when Shh without a cholesterol adduct is used in mice, signaling activity is reduced [Lewis et al., 2001]. Such differences have not been easy to explain to date [Kuwabara and Labouesse, 2002].

Ptch, like NPC1, shuttles between the plasma membrane and endosomes by a dynamin-driven process [Martin et al., 2001; Strutt et al., 2001]. Experiments using neural tube explants in chicks demonstrate that Ptch mediates the endocytosis of Shh [Incardona et al., 2000b]. Because Ptch, like NPC1, shares sequence similarities to RND permeases, the question can be raised whether Ptch also has transport activity [Kuwabara and Labouesse, 2002].

A dominant-negative mutation in the SSD of Ptch—the same one that makes SCAP resistant to high levels of cholesterol—releases Smo from inhibition and increases its activity; the mutant retains the ability to sequester and endocytose Hh [Chen and Struhl, 1996; Martin et al., 2001; Strutt et al., 2001].

The genome of *C. elegans* contains 24 predicted proteins that have sequence similarities to Ptch (*Caenorhabditis elegans* Sequencing Consortium, 1998, Kuwabara et al., 2000). Deletion of the *Ce-ptch1* gene disrupts cytokinesis, suggesting that Ptch must have other functions besides inhibiting Smo and sequestering Hh [Kuwabara et al., 2000].

### Smoothened (Smo)

The symbols for Smoothened are Smo and SMO. Some authors have used slightly different symbols (Smoh, SMOH) [Reifenberger et al., 1998].

Smo encodes a 1024 amino acid transmembrane protein that acts as a transducer of the hedgehog (Hh) signal. Smo protein has 7 hydrophobic membrane-spanning domains, an extracellular amino-terminal region, and an intracellular carboxy-terminal region. Smo bears some similarity to G protein-coupled receptors and is most homologous to the Frizzled (Fz) family of serpentine proteins [Alcedo et al., 1996; van den Heuvel and Ingham, 1996].

In humans, *SMO* maps to 7q31-q32. In the absence of Hh, Ptch prevents Smo from signaling. When M-Hh-N binds to Ptch, however, Smo is free to upregulate downstream genes in the network. Activating mutations in *SMO* have been identified in sporadic basal cell carcinomas [Reifenberger et al., 1998; Xie et al., 1998].

### Relationship Between Patched (Ptch) and Smoothened (Smo)

The classical interpretation of the relationship between Ptch and Smo transmembrane proteins indicates that Ptch suppresses Smo from downstream signaling. Hedgehog binding to Ptch alleviates Ptch-mediated repression of Smo by a conformational change that frees Smo for downstream signaling [Stone et al., 1996; Alcedo et al., 2000; Chen and Struhl, 1998; Murone et al., 1999] (Fig. 1).

For more recent interpretation, see the reviews of Denef et al. [2000], Ingham et al. [2000], Kalderon [2000], Ingham and McMahon [2001], Ho and Scott [2002], Incardona et al. [2002], Mullor et al. [2002], Nybakken and Perrimon [2002], and Taipale et al. [2002]. Kalderon [2000] reviewed four models for the regulation of Smo by Ptch and Hh. The classical model has already been discussed. A second model postulates that Hh activates Smo by causing dissociation of the Ptch/Smo complex. In a third model, Ptch inhibits Smo through a diffusible intermediate and Hh binding to Ptch alters the activity of the intermediate, allowing Smo to become activated. In a fourth model, Ptch acts catalytically via a small molecule to suppress Smo, and on Hh binding to Ptch, Smo is activated by becoming dissociated from Ptch and the small molecule.

Intracellular localization of Ptch was demonstrated by Capdevila et al. [1994], who induced a mutation in *Shibire* that affects endocytosis. Incardona et al.

[2000b], noting that M-Shh-N and Ptch colocalize in subcellular vesicles, suggested that internalization of M-Shh-N is mediated by Ptch. Denef et al. [2000] suggested that Ptch and Smo shuttle oppositely between the plasma membrane and cytoplasmic vesicles in response to M-Hh-N ligand.

In the absence of M-Hh-N binding, Ptch may be found principally at the cell membrane. At the same time, Smo may occupy intracellular vesicles. The binding of M-Hh-N to Ptch triggers a dynamin-mediated internalization into endosomes [Capdevila et al., 1994; Incardona et al., 2000b; Martin et al., 2001; Strutt et al., 2001] and this results, indirectly, in the migration of vesicular Smo to the cell membrane (Fig. 2).

Caveolae and caveolin-1 protein, which coats caveolae, may play a role in M-Hh-N uptake by Ptch. Karpen et al. [2001] demonstrated both Ptch and Smo in caveolin-1 enriched lipid rafts. However, only Ptch interacts specifically with caveolin-1 while Smo does not (Fig. 2).

Ptch mediates the post-translational modification of the C-terminal domain of Smo [Ingham et al., 2000]. Modification may include potential enzymatic candidates such as a phosphatase, Protein Kinase A, or cyclin B1 that alter the phosphorylation status of Smo, affecting its stability, activity, and subcellular localization [Alcedo et al., 2000; Denef et al., 2000; Barnes et al., 2001]. When Smo moves to the cell surface, hyperphosphorylation takes place—a putative Smo kinase increasing its activity [Denef et al., 2000; Kalderon, 2000] (Fig. 2). How closely linked phosphorylation of Smo is to its transport to the cell surface is not known at present [Nybakken and Perrimon, 2002]. Unstimulated Ptch may promote dephosphorylation of Smo—a putative Smo phosphatase decreasing Smo’s activity [Denef et al., 2000; Kalderon, 2000].

Denef et al. [2000] provided some evidence that Ptch and Smo do not interact physically in transducing M-Hh-N signals. They suggested that the regulatory interaction between Ptch and Smo need not be stoichiometric. Taipale et al. [2002] indicated that Ptch acts catalytically rather than stoichiometrically. They found that Ptch and Smo are not significantly associated together within responding cells (Fig. 2). They demonstrated that Ptch, unbounded by M-Hh-N, acts substoichiometrically to suppress the activity of Smo. Extremely low levels of Ptch were sufficient to reduce the activity of Smo substantially. For example, a Ptch:Smo ratio of 1:45 suppressed nearly 80% of Smo activity. Taipale et al. [2002] suggested that in the absence of M-Hh-N, Ptch may translocate a small molecule across the lipid bilayer that regulates the activity state of Smo.

In contrast, Incardona et al. [2002] provided some evidence that supported a model in which colocalization of Ptch and Smo occurs in the absence of M-Shh-N. On M-Shh-N binding to Ptch, both Ptch and Smo may undergo simultaneous transport into the endocytic pathway where Smo is subsequently segregated from the Ptch/M-Shh-N complex, which is destined for lysosomal degradation. Possibly late endosomal sorting may control the generation of active Smo.

### Megalin

Megalin (also known as gp330) is a multiligand receptor belonging to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor family. It mediates endocytosis of ligands and targets them for lysosomal degradation or transcytosis [McCarthy et al., 2002]. A null mutation in megalin produces holoprosencephaly in mice [Willnow et al., 1996]. McCarthy et al. [2002] showed that M-Shh-N binds to megalin with high affinity. Direct signal transduction by megalin seems unlikely. Perhaps megalin-mediated endocytosis of M-Shh-N may regulate its availability to Ptch by competing with Ptch for limiting the levels of M-Shh-N. Alternatively, megalin may deliver M-Shh-N to vesicular pools of Ptch (Fig. 2).

The mechanism by which megalin ligands bypass lysosomal degradation is not known. Based on considerations of pH, McCarthy et al. [2002] suggested that M-Shh-N may traffic in complex with megalin and thus be recycled and/or transcytosed.

### Ras-Like in Rat Brain 23 (Rab23)

The Shh and Opb (*Open brain*) genes have opposite roles in neural patterning, Shh being required for ventral cell types and Opb being required for dorsal cell types. Shh mutants are holoprosencephalic [Chiang et al., 1996] and Opb mutants are exencephalic [Günther et al., 1994].

Eggenschwiler et al. [2001] cloned *Opb* and found that it encodes Rab23. Rab proteins make up the largest branch of the Ras superfamily of GTPases. The term Rab stands for “Ras-like in rat brain” [Martinez and Goud, 1998]. Rabs cycle between GDP-bound and GTP-bound conformation. They regulate specific transport steps along the biosynthetic/secretory and endocytic pathways [Chavrier and Goud, 1999].

The activity of Rab23 is downstream of Shh and upstream of Shh target genes. It could affect Shh signaling by regulating endocytosis of Shh/Ptch from the cell surface or by regulating endocytic vesicles containing Shh/Ptch or Shh/megalin [Eggenschwiler et al., 2001; Nybakken and Perrimon, 2002] (Fig. 2).

### Hedgehog-Interacting Protein (Hip)

Chuang and McMahon [1999] isolated Hedgehog-interacting protein (*Hip*), which is found in vertebrates but not in *Drosophila*. *Hip* encodes a membrane-bound glycoprotein that binds to Shh, Ihh, and Dhh. Hip attenuates M-Shh-N signaling (Fig. 2), thus reducing its effective range.

### Growth Arrest Specific 1 (GAS1)

Growth Arrest Specific 1 (GAS1) is a 45 kDa glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked protein originally identified for arresting the cell cycle when overexpressed [Del Sal et al., 1992, 1994, 1995; Stebel et al.,

2000]. Lee et al. [2001] suggested that GAS1 attenuated M-Shh-N signaling (Fig. 2), thus reducing its effective range.

### Downstream Signaling

Many factors are involved in downstream signaling. Costal 2 (Cos2), Fused (Fu), and Suppressor of fused (Sufu) regulate the nuclear transcription and activity of Cubitus interruptus (Ci) (Fig. 3). Other factors include Protein Kinase A (dPKA), Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), Casein Kinase 1 (CK1), Supernumerary limbs (Slimb), SAP18, and CREB-Bound Protein (dCBP) (Fig. 3). The three target genes are Patched (Ptch), Wingless (Wg), and Decapentaplegic (Dpp). Separate sections on these factors appear below, followed by a discussion about their interactions.

### Cubitus Interruptus (Ci) and Gli Gene Family

The segment polarity gene *Cubitus interruptus* (*Ci*), a zinc-finger gene in *Drosophila*, is the ortholog of the Gli gene family in vertebrates. The sequence similarity is striking with a 54.3% identity in a 278-amino acid overlap beginning 13 amino acids before the first zinc finger and extending approximately 100 amino acids beyond the last zinc finger. Between the twelfth amino acid residue of the second repeat and after the end of the fifth repeat, there are 108 amino acids with a 93% identity [Orenic et al., 1990].

Ci is a 155 kDa protein that contains five zinc fingers. It appears as a truncated 75 kDa target repressor or a full-length 155 kDa target activator [Orenic et al., 1990; Aza-Blanc et al., 1997; Ruiz i Altaba, 1997; Tabin and McMahon, 1997; Chen et al., 1999a]. A diagram of Ci appears in Figure 6. Motifs include a suppressor of fused (Sufu)-binding domain (SF), Zinc Finger (ZF) DNA-binding domain, Nuclear Localization Signal (NLS), cleavage site (↑), Nuclear Export Signal (NES), Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylation sites (P), Costal 2 (Cos2)-binding domain (CORD), and CREB-Binding Protein (CBP) domain [Wang et al., 2000b].

The Gli gene family was identified originally by the amplification of human GLI1 in glioblastoma [Kinzler et al., 1987, 1988; Kinzler and Vogelstein, 1990]. GLI1, GLI2, and GLI3 share five highly conserved tandem C2H2 zinc fingers and a conservative histidine-cysteine linker sequence between zinc fingers [Ruppert et al., 1988]. In humans, GLI1 has two isoforms; GLI2 has three alternatively spliced exons; and GLI3 has only one isoform. GLI1, encoding a 1106 amino acid protein, maps to 12q13; GLI2, encoding 812, 829, 1241, or 1258 amino acids, maps to 2q14; and GLI3, encoding 1595 amino acids, maps to 7p13 [Ruppert et al., 1988, 1990; Matsumoto et al., 1996; Reifenberger et al., 1996; Villavicencio et al., 2000].

Less is known about Gli family function in vertebrates than is known about Ci function in *Drosophila*. Gli1 is an activator of hedgehog target genes, but does not appear to require CBP as a coactivator. Apparently Gli1 does not undergo proteolytic cleavage and does not function as a repressor. Gli2 has both activator and repressor forms [Ingham and McMahon, 2001].

Gli3 can undergo proteolytic cleavage, resulting in a truncated 83 kDa repressor form [Wang et al., 2000a]. Although evidence for a Gli3 activator form is weak, some studies have suggested this possibility. Dai et al. [1999], in tissue culture, showed that Gli3 activates a Gli1 promoter in an Shh-dependent manner and is further potentiated by CBP. Gli3 has also been shown to interact with vertebrate Sufu and with human Fu [Pearse et al., 1999; Murone et al., 2000], which might be expected if Shh resulted in a Gli3 activator form that was translocated to the nucleus.

Ruiz i Altaba et al. [2002] showed that in mice Shh can induce Gli1 and Gli2 but Shh-Gli1 seems to have a mutually repressive interaction with Gli3. Gli2 may also induce Gli1. Fgf2 was found to induce the expression of Gli2 and Gli3. Target genes of Gli1, Gli2, and Gli3 include Wnt, Igf2, and Pdgfra (Fig. 9).

Three distinct Gli proteins in vertebrates instead of one Ci ortholog in *Drosophila* allow more complex responses within target fields. Thus, cellular response to hedgehog signaling might not simply depend on the level of ligand exposure, but also on the particular Gli genes expressed [Ingham and McMahon, 2001].

**Figure 9.** Shh induces Gli1 and Gli2 but Shh-Gli1 mutually repress interaction with Gli3. Gli2 may also induce Gli1. Fgf2 induces Gli2 and Gli3. Target genes upregulated include Wnt, Igf2, and Pdgfra. Modified after Ruiz i Altaba et al. [2002].

---

<sup>e</sup>Suppressor of fused has been commonly abbreviated as Su(fu). However, in discussing human mutations for medulloblastoma caused by Suppressor of Fused, Taylor et al. [2002] set the precedent of simplifying the term; they used SUFU rather than SU(FU).

<sup>f</sup>Unfortunately, Human Krüppel-Related Gene 4 (HKR4), which maps to 8q24.3, has been misclassified as a member of the GLI gene family and was called GLI4 by Kas et al. [1996]. Also, in *Drosophila*, the Gli gene is not an ortholog of Gli; it is an unrelated gene in which Gli stands for Gliotactin [Ruppert et al., 1988].

Vertebrate Gli genes may be tissue specific, may have unevenly partitioned activator and repressor functions, may be coexpressed, possibly being competitive or working synergistically, or may be partially redundant [Ruiz i Altiba, 1997, 1999; Aza-Blanc et al., 2000].

GLI1 is commonly expressed in almost all isolated basal cell carcinomas [Dahmane et al., 1997]. Nilsson et al. [2000] overexpressed Gli1 in transgenic mice, inducing basal cell carcinomas and trichoepitheliomas. GLI2 mutations in humans have been reported with holoprosencephaly [Roessler et al., 2002].

GLI3 mutations cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly [Biesecker, 1997; Wild et al., 1997] and Pallister-Hall syndrome [Biesecker, 1997; Kang et al., 1997]. Biesecker [1997] indicated that the syndromes do not overlap clinically to any significant extent. He further indicated that in Greig cephalopolysyndactyly, GLI3 mutations are of the translocation, deletion, missense, splicing, and frameshift types whereas in Pallister-Hall syndrome, only frameshift mutations occur. Biesecker hypothesized that syndrome differences could be explained by the effects that the two groups of mutations have on the balance of activator and repressor forms of GLI3.

Isolated medulloblastoma is found rarely, if ever, with GLI3 mutations, although two patients with Greig cephalopolysyndactyly and medulloblastoma have been reported with GLI3 mutations [Erez et al., 2002].

Mice with a null mutation for Gli2 or for Gli2 plus a heterozygous mutation in Gli3 mimic VACTERL association including vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, renal, and limb anomalies [Kim et al., 2001]. Pallister-Hall syndrome and VACTERL association share in common anal atresia, cardiac anomalies, renal abnormalities, and limb defects. Perhaps patients with VACTERL association might be worked up for digenic heterozygous mutations in Gli2 plus Gli3.

### Phosphorylation of Cubitus Interruptus (Ci), Protein Kinase A (PKA), Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3), and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1)

The proteolysis of Ci from the 155 kDa form to the repressive 75 kDa form requires phosphorylation of Ci (Figs. 3, 6). Chen et al. [1999b] found that Protein Kinase A (PKA) phosphorylates four consensus sites on Ci; three involve serine (Ser838, Ser856, and Ser892) and one involves threonine (Thr1006). The three phosphoserines are essential for Ci proteolysis and transcriptional activity. Phosphothreonine does not affect Ci function; Prorok and Lawrence [1989] demonstrated that phosphothreonine is a poor substrate for PKA activity.

Following PKA-primed phosphorylation of Ci, Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 (GSK3) and Casein Kinase 1 (CK1) further phosphorylate Ci on serines near PKA phosphorylation sites (Fig. 3). This is essential for proteolytic processing because alteration of GSK3 or CK1 sites prevents proteolysis [Jia et al., 2002; Price and Kalderon, 2002].

${}^{g}$Shaggy (Sgg), also known as Zest-white 3 (Zw3), is the Drosophila ortholog of vertebrate GSK3 [Jia et al., 2002].

Hedgehog signaling, resulting in the active 155 kDa form, probably reduces the Ci phosphorylation level by the action of a phosphatase [Aza-Blanc et al., 1997; Chen et al., 1999a; Wang and Holmgren, 1999].

### Costal 2 (Cos2)

Costal 2 (Cos2) is a microtubule-associated kinesin-like protein. Kinesins are motor proteins defined by their motor domain of approximately 320 amino acid residues that bind and hydrolyse ATP, and bind to microtubules. The motor domain is commonly coupled to additional structural or regulatory domains that can attach to other cofactors, adaptor proteins, or interaction modules [Kamal and Goldstein, 2002; Mandelkow and Mandelkow, 2002]. Woehlke et al. [1997] located the microtubule-binding site in three loops that cluster on the motor surface. The core of the microtubule-binding interface resides in a highly conserved loop and helix (L12/$\alpha$5). Critical residues are positively charged while microtubules are negatively charged.

Fused (*vide infra*) is known to phosphorylate Cos2 at two positions—one in the region between the motor domain and the heptad repeats at serine 572 and to a lesser extent in the C-terminal domain at serine 931 [Nybakken et al., 2002]. Cos2 binds to the microtubules, to the CORD domain of Ci, and to the C-terminal domain of Fused [Wang et al., 2000b; Ascano et al., 2002] (Figs. 3, 6). Monnier et al. [2002] found, in contrast to Wang et al. [2000b], that Cos2 can bind closer to the amino terminus of Ci between the Sufu binding domain and the zinc finger domain (Fig. 6).

### Fused (Fu)

Fused (*Fu*), a segment polarity gene, is a serine/threonine kinase. In *Drosophila*, the original weak *Fu* mutation has a maternal effect; females have tumorous ovaries [Préat et al., 1990]. Phosphorylation of Fu occurs in response to hedgehog signaling and involves an activation loop for Fu transcription [Fukumoto et al., 2001]. The carboxy-terminal domain then binds to Cos2 and phosphorylates it [Ascano et al., 2002; Nybakken et al., 2002]. Thérond et al. [1999] demonstrated that Fu is required to maintain Ptch and Wingless (Wg) expression (Fig. 3).

### Suppressor of Fused (Sufu)

Suppressor of fused (*Sufu*) has been identified in *Drosophila* [Préat, 1992], chicks, mice [Pearse et al., 1999], and humans (*SUFU*) [Stone et al., 1999]. Human SUFU exhibits a 37% sequence identity with *Drosophila* Sufu and a 97% sequence identity with mouse Sufu. Two alternately spliced protein isoforms include a 433 amino acid 48 kDa form and a 484 amino acid 54 kDa form. The protein differs only by the inclusion or exclusion of 52 amino acids at the carboxy terminus [Stone et al., 1999].

Human SUFU contains a PEST domain [Stone et al., 1999]. A PEST motif is an amino acid sequence rich in proline (P), glutamic acid (E), serine (S), and threonine (T). It is often found in proteins that undergo

rapid degradation. Serine/threonine residues are phosphorylated as part of or all of the signal to degrade the protein [Rechsteiner and Rogers, 1996].

In *Drosophila*, Sufu binds to the Sufu domain of Ci near the amino terminus and also binds to Fu. However, transcription of activator 155 kDa Ci is attenuated in the nucleus by Sufu, which stabilizes the latent form of Ci. With high levels of hedgehog signaling, Ci is converted into a labile and active form, possibly by dissociating it from Sufu [Wang et al., 2000b] (Fig. 3).

Stone et al. [1999] found that human SUFU interacts with GLI1, GLI2, GLI3, and Slimb, indicating that SUFU is a negative regulator of the hedgehog signaling network. They suggested that SUFU can inhibit GLI-mediated transactivation and also serve as an adaptor protein that links GLI to the Slimb-dependent proteasomal degradation pathway. Cheng and Bishop [2002] found that Sufu represses Gli-mediated transcription by recruiting SAP18, a component of the histone deacetylase complex Sin3.

Human SUFU is widely expressed in fetal and adult tissues; it maps to 10q24-q25, a region which is deleted in glioblastoma, prostate cancer, malignant melanoma, and endometrial cancer [Gray et al., 1995; Rasheed et al., 1995; Albarosa et al., 1996; Peiffer-Schneider et al., 1998; Stone et al., 1999]. Taylor et al. [2002] reported a subset of children with medulloblastoma and SUFU mutations, both germline and somatic, accompanied by loss of heterozygosity of the wildtype allele.

### Supernumerary Limbs (Slimb)

Supernumerary limbs (Slimb) is an F-box/WD40-repeat protein functioning in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway [Jiang and Struhl, 1998; Patton et al., 1998; Kipreos and Pagano, 2000] (Fig. 3). Slimb is the *Drosophila* ortholog of vertebrate βTrCP. Slimb is required for Ci proteolysis to the 75 kDa repressor form, although it remains unclear how Slimb recognizes phosphorylated Ci. Slimb (βTrCP) can recognize paired GSK3 phosphorylation sites on β-catenin; however, the sites occur in a specific consensus sequence DS(P)XXS(P) and the sites on Ci do not conform to this sequence. Perhaps Slimb recognizes more epitopes than are currently known or perhaps multiple weak binding sites on Ci collectively allow it to associate with Slimb [Price and Kalderon, 2002]. It is also possible that phosphorylation underlies the known isoforms of Slimb [Spenser et al., 1999]. Ko et al. [2002] suggested that the phosphorylation status of Slimb (βTrCP) might modulate its ability to interact with target proteins.

### Other Factors (Sil, COUP-TFII, Dyrk1, Twist)

Sil (SCL interrupting locus) encodes a 150 kDa cytosolic protein of unknown function. It is highly conserved in vertebrates, but has no homologous regions to any known protein. Sil is an essential component of the sonic hedgehog signaling network acting downstream to Ptc. Mouse null mutants $Sil^{-/-}$ are characterized by neural tube defects, left/right axis abnormalities, holoprosencephaly-like features, and early lethality. $Sil^{+/-}$ heterozygotes are normal [Israeli et al., 2001].

Human SIL, mapping to 1p32, encodes a protein of 1287 amino acid residues beginning at the third exon. Human SIL and murine Sil have a 73% overall identity. No human mutations for holoprosencephaly have been found [Karkera et al., 2002].

Krishnan et al. [1997] identified an Shh response element in chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factor II (COUP-TFII). They suggested that Shh signaling may result in dephosphorylation of a target factor required for activating COUP-TFII, Islet-1, and Gli response element-dependent gene expression.

Mao et al. [2002] investigated the cellular role of Dual specificity Yak1-related kinase 1 (Dyrk1), finding that it enhanced Gli1-dependent gene transcription. However, Shh failed to stimulate Dyrk1 activity, suggesting the possibility of a separate pathway mediated by Dyrk1 that may functionally interact with the sonic hedgehog signaling network.

Villavicencio et al. [2000] suggested that murine Twist protein can activate human GLI1 at the transcriptional level by interacting with E-boxes in the first intron. However, no published study to date has demonstrated this.

#### Cyclic AMP Response Element-Binding Protein (CPB)

The cAMP-regulated enhancer (CRE) binds many transcription factors including CRE-binding (CREB) protein (CPB), which is activated as a result of phosphorylation by PKA. CPB is a 2441 amino acid 265 kDa nuclear protein which is a coactivator for a number of transcription factors, including 155 kDa activator Ci (Chrivia et al., 1993; Akimaru et al., 1997) (Fig. 3). In humans, CBP maps to 16p13.3. Microdeletions resulting in haploinsufficiency of CBP cause Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome [Petrij et al., 1995; Blough et al., 2000].

#### Interactions of Ci, Cos2, Fu, and Sufu

In downstream signaling, Ci, Cos2, Fu, and Sufu form a tetrameric complex which results in the nuclear transcription and activity of Ci (Fig. 3). In the absence of hedgehog stimulation, the complex is tethered to the microtubules by Cos2. Both Cos2 and Sufu retain Ci in the cytoplasm, the former being bound to Ci’s CORD domain and the latter being bound to its Sufu domain (SF) (Fig. 6). Cos2 promotes proteolysis of Ci, generating the truncated 75 kDa repressor form of Ci (Rep-Ci). The process requires phosphorylation of Ci by dPKA, CK1, and Sgg, and also the activities of Slimb, Sufu, and SAP18. Translocation of Rep-Ci to the nucleus prevents transcription of target genes *Ptc*, *Wg*, and *Dpp* [Robbins et al., 1997; Ruiz i Altaba, 1997; Tabin and McMahon, 1997; Monnier et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2000b; Ingham and McMahon, 2001; Mullor et al., 2002; Nybakken and Perrimon, 2002].

With intermediate levels of hedgehog stimulation, the Ci, Cos2, Fu, Sufu complex dissociates from the microtubules, inhibiting the cleavage of Ci (Fig. 3), possibly
through dephosphorylation of Ci. The full length 155 kDa activator form of Ci (Act-Ci) binds to Sufu, an interaction that restricts its nuclear translocation. Sufu attenuates its transcriptional activity. Higher levels of hedgehog stimulation promote dissociation of Sufu from Act-Ci, which together with cofactor dCBP upregulate target genes *Ptch*, *Wg*, and *Dpp* [Robbins et al., 1997; Ruiz i Ataba, 1997; Tabin and McMahon, 1997; Monnier et al., 1998; Wang et al., 2000b; Ingham and McMahon, 2001; Mullor et al., 2002; Nybakken and Perrimon, 2002].

# Target Genes

Target genes in *Drosophila* include *Ptch*, *Wingless* (*Wg*), and *Decapentaplegic* (*Dpp*). These are the orthologs of the vertebrate target genes: *Ptch* (*PTCH*), the *Wnt* (*WNT*) family, and the bone morphogenetic proteins (*BMPs*) of the TGFβ superfamily; they are essential for normal embryonic development and differentiation of many adult tissues.

The upregulation of *Ptch* expression, resulting in *Ptch* protein at the cell membrane, sequesters hedgehog and limits its spread beyond the cells in which it is produced [Chen and Struhl, 1996]. Thus, a balance is created by the antagonism of Hedgehog and *Ptch*, whose relative concentrations alternate with respect to each other [Cohen, 1999].

*Wnt* genes encode a family of secreted glycoproteins that share overall sequence identity and a conserved pattern of 23-24 cysteine residues. The original ones defined were *Drosophila Wingless* (*Wg*) and murine *Wnt1*. *Drosophila* possesses 4 and the mouse at least 18 *Wnt* genes. They have been implicated in many developmental processes such as cell differentiation, cell polarity, cell migration, and cell proliferation. Misregulation of Wnt signaling is implicated in developmental defects and oncogenesis [Moon et al., 1997; Miller et al., 1999; Kühl et al., 2000; Taipale and Beachy, 2001].

There are two Wnt signaling pathways: Wnt/β-catenin and Wnt/Ca²⁺. Members of the Frizzled (*Fz*) family of 7-pass transmembrane proteins serve as receptors of Wnt signaling. They have an extracellular cysteine-rich domain (CRD) at the amino terminus that binds Wnt. An LDL receptor-related protein is a coreceptor for Wnt and binds to an Fz CRD in a Wnt-dependent manner. Sulfated glycosaminoglycans are also required for optimal *Wg* activity [Cumberledge and Reichsman, 1997; Miller et al., 1999; Kühl et al., 2000; Dann et al., 2001]. Dubois et al. [2001] demonstrated that regulated endocytic routing modulates *Wg* signaling in *Drosophila* embryos.

In the canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway, a Frizzled receptor with a Wnt ligand increases cytoplasmic β-catenin, which translocates to the nucleus and, together with LEF/TCF, upregulates target genes. Some components of the pathway—Wnt, Fz, and β-catenin—are positive, activated during signaling. Other components—GSK3 and TCF-Groucho-CBP—are negative, inhibited during signaling. Mutations in β-catenin have been identified in many human cancers, including, among others, colorectal cancer, endometrial cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma, and pilomatrixoma. In *APC*, a tumor suppressor gene that is part of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway, mutations are known to cause colorectal polyposis and adenocarcinoma [Miller et al., 1999; Nusse et al., 1999; Kühl et al., 2000].

Activation of the Wnt/Ca²⁺ pathway results in intracellular Ca²⁺ release and activation of Ca²⁺-sensitive enzymes: Ca²⁺-calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CamKII) and Protein Kinase C (PKC) [Miller et al., 1999; Kühl et al., 2000].

*Dpp*, most closely related to BMP2 and BMP4 [Massagué et al., 1994], acts at short range to provide dorsal-ventral positional information to the embryonic ectoderm. *Dpp* positional information in multiple target fields requires synergistic signaling between two different BMP receptor-ligand pairs [Podos and Ferguson, 1999]. The heteromeric receptor complex consists of two types of serine-threonine kinases [Cohen, 2002, 2003]. On *Dpp* ligand binding, the type II receptor (*Punt*, *Put*) phosphorylates the type I receptor (*Thick veins*, *Tkv*), which activates Mad and Med followed by transcription of target genes. A second type I receptor (*Saxophone*, *Sax*) and its ligand (either *Screw*, *Scw* or *Glassbottom boat*, *Gbb*) are also essential for normal patterning in each tissue [Podos and Ferguson, 1999].

Entchev et al. [2000] demonstrated that long range *Dpp* movement involves intracellular trafficking by dynamin-mediated endocytosis of *Dpp* and its type I receptor (*Tkv*). They suggested that a balance between recycling and degradation of *Dpp* ligand determines the shape of the gradient.

## MUTATIONS, GENE OVEREXPRESSION, AND TERATOGENS IN ANIMALS

Table IV summarizes mutations, gene overexpression, and teratogens involving the hedgehog signaling network and cholesterol biosynthesis in animals. The null mutation *Shh⁻/⁻* in mice produces a severe phenotype: holoprosencephaly and distal anteroposterior limb deficiencies [Chiang et al., 1996, 2001]. Overexpression of *Shh* (*Shh↑↑*) in mice results in basal cell carcinomas and skeletal anomalies [Oro et al., 1997].

Two teratogens, AY9944 and BM15.766, block sterol Δ⁷-reductase, resulting in the accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol and reduced serum cholesterol with the production of holoprosencephaly in rats [Barbu et al., 1984; Kolf-Clauw et al., 1996, 1997; Gofflot et al., 1999]. Lanoue et al. [1997] studied mice with a targeted modification of the *alipoprotein B* (*apoB*) gene; when treated with BM15.766, sterol Δ⁷-reductase was blocked, resulting in reduced serum cholesterol and the accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. Phenotypic findings were similar to those found in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome and included holoprosencephaly together with limb and genital defects. The specific block in cholesterol biosynthesis found in Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome is identical to that produced by the two teratogens, AY9944 and BM15.766, which result in holoprosencephaly in experimental animals (Fig. 10).

**Fig. 10.** Partial, simplified cholesterol biosynthesis pathway. Double arrows indicate multiple steps missing. Note sterol $\Delta^7$-reductase inhibitors: Smith-Lemli-Opitz (SLO) mutations ($DHCR7^{-/-}$) and teratogens AY9944 and BM15.766. They result in a reduced serum cholesterol and an accumulation of 7-dehydrocholesterol. Holoprosencephaly occurs in about 4% of Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome cases. AY9944 and BM15.766 induce holoprosencephaly in rats. BM15.766 and hypomorphic apolB cause holoprosencephaly in mice. Note the sterol $\Delta^{24}$-reductase inhibitors: teratogen triparanol and mutations in human desmosterolosis. Triparanol is associated with various malformations in rats, and holoprosencephaly has been described. The clinical phenotype of human desmosterolosis has not included holoprosencephaly to date, although a hypoplastic corpus callosum has been noted in one case. From Cohen and Shiota [2002].

Triparanol is a sterol $\Delta^{24}$-reductase inhibitor that results in an accumulation of desmosterol and reduced serum cholesterol (Fig. 10). Triparanol has been used experimentally in rats to produce a wide range of malformations, including holoprosencephaly [Roux, 1964]. In contrast to triparanol-treated rats with holoprosencephaly, no instances of frank holoprosencephaly have been reported in human desmosterolosis to date, although one instance of a hypoplastic corpus callosum has been noted. Other blocks in cholesterol biosynthesis are known that also do not result in holoprosencephaly [Kelley, 2000].

Cooper et al. [1998] found that when AY9944, triparanol, cyclopamine, or jervine were added to cells with a stably integrated construct for expressing Shh, the autoprocessed Shh-N was detected with the same mobility as cholesterol-modified Shh-N. The cholesterol adduct was efficiently replaced by 7-dehydrocholesterol in AY9944-treated cells and desmosterol in triparanol-treated cells. It is possible that other 27-carbon cholesterol precursors might also be able to serve as sterol adducts in the Shh autoprocessing reaction. However, neither cyclopamine nor jervine replace the sterol adduct [Cooper et al., 1998].

To examine the possibility that AY9944, triparanol, cyclopamine, and jervine caused their effects on target tissues, Cooper et al. [1998] used a neural plate explant, a target tissue that does not contain Shh but has the ability to respond to it. They found that these teratogens inhibited the response of target tissues to Shh-N. Thus, teratogens such as AY9944 and triparanol still permit Shh autoprocessing by using cholesterol precursors as sterol adducts of Shh-N, and even though Shh-N is active, the target tissues still fail to respond to Shh-N signaling.

Incardona et al. [1998] studied the effects of AY944 and cyclopamine on neural plate explants, also finding that both teratogens blocked the response of target tissues to Shh-N. When exogenous cholesterol supplementation was added to the explants, the response to Shh-N was restored in AY9944-treated explants but not in cyclopamine-treated explants, suggesting that cyclopamine-induced teratogenesis may produce a more direct antagonism to Shh signaling transduction. ${}^{h}$

Cooper et al. [1998] suggested that defects in intracellular cholesterol transport and homeostasis are the common basis for the induction of holoprosencephaly by cyclopamine and 7-dehydrocholesterol inhibitor AY9944. The study of Incardona et al. [2001a] did not support the hypothesis of Cooper et al. [1998]; they found that cyclopamine inhibition of sonic hedgehog signaling transduction is not mediated through effects on cholesterol transport.

Megalin is a receptor for apoB-containing lipoproteins and is expressed in the yolk sac endoderm and the embryonic neuroectoderm [Farese and Herz, 1998]. McCarthy et al. [2002] demonstrated that M-Shh-N binds to megalin with high affinity. With megalin deficiency, holoprosencephaly is observed in mouse embryos, suggesting a perturbation of the Shh signaling network [Willnow et al., 1996].

Holoprosencephaly in newborn lambs has been traced to the ingestion of the range plant *Veratrum californicum* by pregnant ewes [Binns et al., 1963]. Keeler and Binns [1968] identified steroidal alkaloids in the plant as the cause of holoprosencephaly; two of the isolated compounds were cyclopamine and jervine (Table IV), which have some similarities to cholesterol (Fig. 11). Beachy et al. [1997] tested jervine-treated cells

${}^{h}$ Presumably, the same would be true for the closely-related compound jervine (Fig. 11), although this possibility was not tested by Incardona et al. [1998].

when cyclopamine was given to mice with *Ptch*⁻/⁻ or *Smo*↑↑, the oncogenic mutational effects could be reversed.

In contrast, Ma et al. [2002] induced a null mutation in *Smo*, finding a neural plate defect in the region of the prospective forebrain consistent with later developing holoprosencephaly. However, further embryonic development permitting full-blown holoprosencephaly was precluded by concomitant cardiac defects.

Many mutations have been induced in *Gli1*, *Gli2*, and *Gli3*. In mice, several abnormal alleles in *Gli3* are subsumed under the category “extra toes” (*Gli3*<sup>Xt</sup>) [Johnson, 1967]. The original *Xt* allele contains a 5′ deletion [Schimmang et al., 1994]. The *XtJ* allele contains an 51.5 kb deletion (Maynard et al., 2002). Both homozygotes (*Gli3*<sup>Xt/Xt</sup> and *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/XtJ</sup>) lack *Gli3* expression, indicating that heterozygous dominant phenotypes in mice are due to haploinsufficiency. A zinc-finger deletion is symbolized as zfd, for example, *Gli2*<sup>zfd/+</sup> [Mo et al., 1997].

The null mutation *Gli1*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup> in mice has a surprisingly normal phenotype [Park et al., 2000]. Overexpression of *Gli1* (*Gli1*↑↑) in frogs produces skin tumors in tadpoles [Dahmane et al., 1997]. Overexpression of *Gli1* (*Gli1*↑↑) in mice produces basal cell carcinomas and trichoepitheliomas [Nilsson et al., 2000].

In the mouse, a *Gli2* heterozygote (*Gli2*<sup>zfd/+</sup>) has no detectable abnormalities, but in the null mutation (*Gli2*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup>), multiple anomalies are found: cleft palate; tooth defects; vertebral anomalies; short limbs; CNS floorplate abnormalities; and failure of notochordal regression [Mo et al., 1997; Matise et al., 1998]. In double null *Gli1*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup>; *Gli2*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup>, failure of spinal cord formation is similar to that observed with *Gli2*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup> [Matise et al., 1998].

Kim et al. [2001] found that the null mutation *Gli2*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup> in mice mimics human VACTERL association with vertebral, anal, cardiac, tracheoesophageal, and limb defects. They found that *Gli2*<sup>zfd/zfd</sup>; *Gli3*<sup>zfd/+</sup> also caused a VACTERL-like association with renal anomalies additionally.

In mice with heterozygous *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/+</sup>, the phenotype consists of limb defects and other anomalies: anterior and posterior digit duplications similar to those found in human Greig cephalopolysyndactyly; white belly spot; interfrontal bone (abnormal in mice); and an increased frequency of hydrocephalus [Johnson, 1967, 1969; Hui and Joyner, 1993; Schimmang et al., 1994; Mo et al., 1997; Maynard et al., 2002]. In the null mutation *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/XtJ</sup>, abnormalities include frequent stillborns; abnormal limbs with severe syndactyly; partial exencephaly; abnormal skull ossification; abnormal olfactory nerves; microphthalmia; absent semicircular canals; abnormal sternum; and fused neural arches [Johnson, 1967, 1969; Pohl et al., 1990; Hui and Joyner, 1993; Schimmang et al., 1994; Mo et al., 1997; Maynard et al., 2002]. In the double mutant *Gli2*<sup>zfd/+</sup>; *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/XtJ</sup>, the phenotype is more severe than with *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/XtJ</sup>, indicating some redundancy of *Gli2* and *Gli3* [Mo et al., 1997].

In the double null mutant *Shh*⁻/⁻; *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/XtJ</sup>, the limb phenotype is indistinguishable from that of *Gli3*<sup>XtJ/XtJ</sup>. Shh has no effect on skeletal patterning in the absence of Gli3. Thus, Gli3 is implicated as an obligate component of the zone of polarizing activity function required in responding cells for Shh to exert polarizing activity [Liftingtung et al., 2002].

An insertional mutation in *CBP*, resulting in CBP-deficient (*CBP*⁺/⁻) mice, produces a phenotype with some Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome-like features [Oike et al., 1999].
