[64] Enzymic Reduction of $d$-Biotin $d$-Sulfoxide  
to $d$-Biotin  

By ALICE DEL CAMPILLO-CAMPBELL, DANIEL DYKHUIZEN, and  
P. PATRICK CLEARY  

Biotin sulfoxides are ubiquitous in nature, present in culture filtrates  
of various microorganisms and in cows' milk, and the $d$-isomer is an oxidative product contaminating most preparations of authentic biotin. ${}^{1}$ In an aerobic environment biotin $d$-sulfoxide may be one of the major chemical forms of biotin and, therefore, an important source of biotin for organisms able to utilize this oxidized vitamer. One example is *Escherichia coli*, which has a biotin sulfoxide reduction system separate from the biotin biosynthetic pathway. ${}^{2}$ The natural function of sulfoxide reduction may be either to scavenge biotin sulfoxide from the environment or else to reduce bound intracellular biotin that happens to become oxidized. The reduction of biotin $d$-sulfoxide to biotin is a complex reaction. At least three proteins appear to be required for this conversion. *E. coli* strains with mutations in genes ABFCD located near 17 min in the *E. coli* chromosome ${}^{3}$ are unable to synthesize biotin, but (except for one mutant, bioC18) they are able to grow with biotin sulfoxide. Enzyme extracts from these mutants, except bioC18, catalyze the conversion of biotin sulfoxide to biotin. ${}^{2}$ Starting with a strain carrying the bioA24 mutation, four genes have been identified which are required for biotin sulfoxide utilization, bisA, bisB, bisC, and bisD. ${}^{4}$ Two of these genes map near the biotin gene cluster, and the other two are in other parts of the *E. coli* chromosome. BioC18 is a double mutant, $bio^{-} \, bis^{-}$. Enzyme extracts from the bis mutants do not catalyze the conversion of biotin sulfoxide to biotin. However, all the extracts contain a heat-stable protein, which is required for the reaction.

The reaction catalyzed by biotin sulfoxide reductase may be written as follows:

$$
\text{Biotin sulfoxide } + \text{ protein(SH)}_{2} \rightarrow \text{ biotin } + \text{ protein-S}_{2} + \text{ H}_{2}\text{O}
$$
(heat stable)

Protein-$\text{S}_{2}$ may be reduced either chemically with dithiothreitol (DTT) or enzymically in the presence of NADPH (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) and a heat-labile protein, which is stimulated by

FAD (flavin adenine dinucleotide). This latter enzyme is present in bioA24 and bioC18 extracts.

Protein-$S_2$ does not appear to be either thioredoxin${}^5$ or glutaredoxin. ${}^6$ Purified yeast thioredoxin kindly supplied by A. Holmgren has very little activity in the above reaction. Enzyme extracts from a thioredoxin-deficient mutant, *E. coli* B tsn C7004, ${}^7$ and a thioredoxin reductase-deficient mutant, *E. coli* KK1048 ${}^8$ catalyze the conversion of biotin sulfoxide to biotin. ${}^9$ Glutathione, glutathione reductase, and NADPH are required for glutaredoxin activity. ${}^6$ Enzyme extracts from the thioredoxin-deficient mutant and the partially purified protein-$S_2$ do not catalyze the conversion of biotin sulfoxide to biotin in the presence of the glutathione system. ${}^9$

Genetic studies have shown that the *bis* gene products are not needed for the reduction of methionine sulfoxide to methionine, ${}^4$ a reaction known to require thioredoxin. ${}^{10}$

### Assay

#### Principle
The assay depends on the formation of $d$-biotin from $d$-biotin $d$-sulfoxide in the presence of an enzyme extract from a wild-type (*bis* ${}^+$) strain, bioA-24, or in the presence of partially purified enzyme fractions from bioA24 and bioC18 *bis*A strains. The biotin formed is assayed by the disk microbiological method. ${}^{11}$ The assay organism, strain SA291, ${}^4$ is missing the entire biotin operon and therefore needs biotin for growth.

#### Reagents
$d$-Biotin $d$-sulfoxide (BDS) is synthesized and purified according to the methods described by D. B. Melville ${}^{12}$ and modified by H. Ruis *et al.* ${}^{13}$ Solutions of BDS contain less than 0.01% of biotin. No detectable biotin is observed in the assay plate with the biotin sulfoxide concentrations employed in the assay.

Other reagents are commercial preparations.

#### Procedure
The reaction mixture contains in 0.25 ml, 25 $\mu$mol of ammonium acetate, pH 9.5, 6 $\mu$mol of dithiothreitol (DTT), 4.8 nmol of $d$-biotin $d$-sulfoxide (BDS) and the enzyme solution, 0.1–10 mg of protein.

The reaction is started by adding BDS after preincubation of the other ingredients for 10 min at $37^{\circ}$. After 15 min at $37^{\circ}$, the reaction is stopped by adding 0.2 mmol of trichloroacetic acid. The acid precipitate is removed by centrifugation, and the supernatant, usually 20 $\mu$l, is assayed for biotin. The assay plate contains 300 ml of 1.4% agar in synthetic medium$^{14}$ supplemented with 0.01% 2,3,5-triphenyl-2$H$-tetrazolium chloride, 0.16% dextrose, 10 mg L-histidine, and 1 ml of a fresh culture of strain SA291.

NADPH (0.125 $\mu$mol) can be substituted for DTT in the assay, but only 10–20% of the activity is obtained. A NADPH-generating system composed of 0.06 $\mu$mol of NADP$^{+}$, 1 $\mu$mol of glucose 6-phosphate, and 0.02 unit of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase is as effective as DTT. With the purified biotin sulfoxide reductase and the heat-stable protein, NADPH and the NADPH-generating system are inactive.

Although the rate of biotin synthesis is nonlinear with crude extracts, linearity can be achieved employing low concentrations of purified biotin sulfoxide reductase (20–200 $\mu$g) and large amounts of crude or purified heat-stable protein (2–9 mg).

**Units and Specific Activity.** Enzyme units are defined as micrograms of biotin formed per 15 min. Specific activity is the number of units per milligram of protein.

## Preparation of Enzymes

### Growth of Cells

Cells are grown to stationary phase at $37^{\circ}$ with shaking in either tryptone broth or synthetic medium$^{14}$ containing 0.4% dextrose, $4 \times 10^{-2}$ mg/ml L-histidine, and $3 \times 10^{-3}$ $\mu$g/ml $d$-biotin. The cells are harvested in the cold at 6000 rpm (Sorvall, GSA rotor) and washed twice with cold 0.9% NaCl. The washed cells are usually frozen ($-20^{\circ}$) before extraction.

### Preparation of Extracts

All procedures are carried out at $0-4^{\circ}$ unless otherwise indicated. Phosphate buffer contains 50 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7.0) and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol.

The frozen cells are thawed and resuspended at 125 times the original concentration in cold phosphate buffer. The cell suspension is disrupted with a Bronson sonifier, Model W140. After centrifugation for 20 min at

$^{14}$ A. Campbell, Virology 14, 22 (1961).
14,000 rpm (Sorvall SS-34 rotor), the supernatant is dialyzed overnight against phosphate buffer. The protein concentration of the extract is determined by the method of Warburg and Christian.¹⁵ The extracts contain between 30 and 50 mg/ml.

### Purification of Biotin Sulfoxide Reductase

Extracts from *E. coli* K12 bioA24, strain R879 (16), are used to prepare biotin sulfoxide reductase.

#### Streptomycin Sulfate Treatment
A 20% solution of streptomycin sulfate is added to the dialyzed extract to precipitate nucleic acids. About 0.3 mg of streptomycin sulfate is added per milligram of protein. After stirring for 10 min, the precipitate is removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and discarded.

#### Ammonium Sulfate Fractionation
Solid ammonium sulfate is added to the streptomycin sulfate supernatant to 40% saturation. After stirring for 20 min, the precipitate is centrifuged down at 14,000 rpm, dissolved in phosphate buffer, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The buffer is changed in the morning, and the fraction is dialyzed for another 4 hr. This fraction contains between 30 and 50 mg of protein per milliliter.

#### $Ca_3(PO_4)_2$ Gel Adsorption
Aged $Ca_3(PO_4)_2$ gel (Nutritional Biochemicals Corporation) is added to the 0–40% dialyzed ammonium sulfate fraction so that 82–85% of the protein is adsorbed on the gel. The amount of gel required is determined for each batch of $Ca_3(PO_4)_2$ gel with small trial runs. The mixture is stirred for 10 min and centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant contains between 4 and 6 mg of protein per milliliter and most of the biotin sulfoxide reductase.

#### Sephadex G-50 Chromatography
The gel supernatant is applied to a Sephadex G-50 column (Pharmacia, Sweden, medium; 3 × 45 cm) in 10 mM ammonium acetate, pH 8.6, containing 1 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. The enzyme is eluted with

the same buffer at a flow rate of 20 ml/hr, 4 ml per tube. Tubes 15 to 23 and 24 to 40 are pooled, and the fractions are brought to 70% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. The precipitates are collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm after stirring for 20 min, dissolved in phosphate buffer, and dialyzed overnight against 1 liter of phosphate buffer. The activity of the two fractions is about the same and represents close to a 50-fold purification.

The purification procedure is summarized in Table I.

### Purification of Heat-Stable Protein-$S_2$

Extracts from *E. coli* K12 bioC18, strain R876${}^{16}$ are used. This strain is also $bis^{-}$.

The same steps used in the purification of the biotin sulfoxide reductase are followed up to the $\mathrm{Ca}_{3}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{2}$ gel step. The protein is eluted from the gel after washing the gel with cold water. The gel is eluted first with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7, containing 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After 0.5 hr, the mixture is centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The supernatant is saved. The gel is eluted again for another 0.5 hr with 0.1 M potassium phosphate, pH 7.7, containing 3 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. After centrifugation, the two eluates are combined and brought to 80% saturation with solid ammonium sulfate. The precipitate is collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm, dissolved in phosphate buffer, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. The purification at this stage is about 6-fold.

This fraction is heated in 4-ml batches in a $90^{\circ}-95^{\circ}$ bath for about 1 min, chilled, and centrifuged. The supernatant contains 30–50% of the protein and most of the activity, a 2- to 3-fold purification. Several batches of the heated fractions are combined, and 47 ml (202 mg) are filtered through a PM-10 Amicon ultrafilter. The filtrate contains 9% of the protein with a 5.5-fold purification, and this is concentrated by passing the filtrate through an UM${}_2$ Amicon ultrafilter. The overall purification is about 70-fold. The apparent molecular weight of the active protein is approximately 10,000, based on sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) acrylamide gel electrophoresis.

### Partial Separation of the Heat-Labile Protein-$S_2$ Reductase

Extracts from *E. coli* K12 bioC18, strain R876${}^{16}$ are the source of this enzyme.

Solid ammonium sulfate is added to a dialyzed extract to 40% saturation.

tion. After stirring for 15 min, the precipitate is collected by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm. The supernatant is brought to 80% saturation, and after stirring for 15 min the precipitate is collected by centrifugation. The precipitates, 0–40% and 40–80%, are dissolved in 50 mM Tris·HCl pH 7.6 [tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane chloride] containing 1 mM EDTA, and dialyzed overnight against the same buffer. Preliminary attempts at further purification of this enzyme have not been very successful. The results presented in Table II show that the 0–40% fraction contains the protein-$S_2$ reductase as indicated by the activity in the presence of the NADPH generating system.

Table II shows the requirement for biotin sulfoxide reductase, the heat-stable fraction, and the protein-$S_2$ reductase in the conversion of biotin sulfoxide to biotin.

${}^a$ Purified BDS reductase is the 50-fold purified Sephadex fraction, 16.5 $\mu$g added. Purified protein-$S_2$ is the 70-fold purified fraction, 0.19 mg added. Crude protein-$S_2$ reductase (R876, 0–40%) and (R876, 40–80%) are the fractions described in the text. 3.8 mg, 3.4 mg, and 0.8 mg (heated) added, respectively. Crude BDS reductase is the dialyzed extract, 0.24 mg added.

${}^b$ DTT-dithiothreitol; NADPH generating system. In experiments 1–6, 8 $\mu$M FAD is present; in 7–10, no FAD is present.

Properties

$pH$ Optimum and $K_{\mathrm{m}}$. The overall reaction has a pH optimum of 9.5 in ammonium acetate buffer. There is 31% activity at pH 10, 65% at pH 8.6, 18% at pH 7.0, and 4% at pH 6.0. The apparent $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ for $d$-biotin $d$-sulfoxide is 5.7 $\mu M$ at pH 9.5.

Specificity. NADH is only 34% as active as NADPH in the overall conversion of biotin sulfoxide to biotin.

Inhibitors and Cofactors. The reaction is strongly inhibited by thiol and vicinal thiol inhibitors. Sodium arsenite (1 mM) inhibits 76%; sodium iodoacetate (5 mM) inhibits 43%; manganous chloride (10 mM) and copper sulfate (10 mM) inhibit 79% and 89%, respectively; and EDTA (10 mM) inhibits 87% of the total activity.

Quinacrine, 0.8 mM, inhibits 88%. This inhibition is reversed by flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). FAD, 8 $\mu M$, enhances the activity 1.5- to 2-fold, while flavin mononucleotide (FMN), 0.8 mM, enhances the activity 1.5-fold.

Stability. Biotin sulfoxide reductase preparations lose about 60% of their activity after 1.5 min at $60^{\circ}$, and the activity is completely destroyed above $90^{\circ}$. The low-molecular-weight protein is stable at $60^{\circ}$, and it loses very little activity above $90^{\circ}$. The protein-$S_2$ reductase is inactivated above $90^{\circ}$. All the enzymes are stable frozen for long periods of time. They lose some activity on repeated freezing and thawing.
