### Abstract

Pathogens such as influenza A viruses (IAV) have to overcome a number of barriers defined and maintained by the host, to successfully establish an infection. One of the initial barriers is collectively characterized as the innate immune system. This is a broad anti-pathogen defense program that ranges from the action of natural killer cells to the induction of an antiviral cytokine response. In this article we will focus on new developments and discoveries concerning the interaction of IAV with the cellular innate immune signaling. We discuss new mechanisms of interference of IAV with the pathogen recognition receptor RIG-I and the type I IFN antagonist NS1 in the background of already known and established concepts. Further we summarize progress related to recently identified IFN induced proteins and the role of RNA interference in the context of IAV infection.

### 1. Introduction

Influenza A viruses (IAV), family members of the Orthomyxoviridae, are the causative agents for the influenza, a disease that occurs in seasonal epidemics and leads to enormous morbidity and economic losses. Besides its epidemic occurrence, IAV possess the potential to cause devastating pandemics as shown in the past by the outbreak of the 1918 “Spanish flu”. The current pandemic spread of a new variant of an H1N1 IAV subtype, now known as swine-origin influenza virus (S-OIV), again highlights that IAV is still a world-wide threat and underlines the necessity to learn more about this virus and its pathobiochemical interactions with the host.

In humans IAV infect epithelial cells of the upper and lower respiratory tract, as nasal mucosa, tonsils, trachea and lungs.

Infections with contemporary strains can proceed without symptoms or may be accompanied by fever, headaches, fatigue, chills, sore throat, nasal congestion and body aches. Besides these typical influenza symptoms, severe side effects, such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure may occur, which are not caused by the IAV itself, but by the strong induction of proinflammatory cytokines in the lungs of patients, which is known as “cytokine burst”. This phenomenon has been in particular reported for infections of humans with highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1 strains (reviewed in ref. [1]).

The innate immune response is the first unspecific defense of the host activated by pathogens like IAV. Once initiated, proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines are released as part of an inflammatory response, which attract immune cells such as macrophages or neutrophils to the source of infection. Among the cytokines, which are induced, the activated type I interferon (IFN) system represents the most powerful innate immune defense mechanism against IAV replication and spread. To establish productive infection, IAV have to cross

the cellular membrane to enter the cell, where they abuse the cellular machinery to support their own reproduction. In addition, IAV start to counteract the host immune response against viral infection that comprises not only the innate, but also the adaptive immune systems. In this article, we focus on the interplay between the potent innate immune response triggered by viral factors and the mechanisms employed by the virus to combat this cellular innate defense.

### 2. Induction of antiviral defense – activation of the innate type I IFN response system

As aforementioned, induction of type I IFN expression is one of the most potent defense mechanisms against IAV infection. Type I IFNs belong to a group of secreted antiviral cytokines, acting as intercellular communication signals. Several type I IFN family members (α, β, ω) were described in mammalian species, whereby especially IFNα/β are immediately expressed in response to IAV infection (reviewed in ref. [2]). The released IFNs not only induce transcription of a number of antiviral acting genes (see Section 3), but also activate dendritic and other immune cells, and prime the adaptive immune system (reviewed in ref. [3]).

#### 2.1. Recognition and defense of viral pathogens – signaling from pattern recognition receptors to IFN induction

Cellular immune responses are stimulated upon sensing of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), such as viral nucleic acids, by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). During IAV infection, genomic and antigenomic single stranded RNAs (ssRNAs) possessing 5′ triphosphate groups are present in infected cells [4–6]. Despite the long lasting belief that double strand RNA (dsRNA)-like structures are produced upon IAV infection it is discussed controversially lately whether double strand RNA products are generated throughout IAV replication [7,8].

Three classes of PRRs were reported to play an important role in sensing IAV infection, including the Toll-like receptors (TLR)-3, -7, and -8 [9], the retinoic acid inducible helicase RIG-I [10], and the nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich-repeat-containing proteins (NLRs) [11]. TLRs are characterized by hydrophobic leucine-rich-repeats, a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin 1 receptor (IL-1R) homology (TIR) domain. These PRRs are predominantly expressed in myeloid-derived antigen-presenting cells and are located on the cell surface or membranes of cytoplasmic vesicles, such as endosomes and the endoplasmic reticulum. TLR3 recognizes dsRNA, whereas TLR7 and TLR8 sense uridine-rich sequences of ssRNA [5]. Depending on the stimulus and the corresponding PRR, distinct signaling pathways are induced by specific adaptor molecules. Activated TLR3 induces the TIR domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFNβ (TRIF) signaling pathway, which branches into induction of TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK-1) and IKKε resulting in interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3)

phosphorylation, as well as activation of IkB kinase 2 (IKK2) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB). Activated TLR7 induces the adaptor protein MyD88 leading to the phosphorylation of IRF-7 via IL-1 receptor associated kinase 1 (IRAK-1) (reviewed in ref. [12]). The related RNA helicases retinoic acid inducible gene-I (RIG-I) and the melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MDA5) are cytoplasmic DEx(D/H) box helicases that signal through homotypic caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) with the mitochondrial IFNβ promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) protein [5,13]. While RIG-I has been reported to predominantly recognize negative-strand RNA viruses, MDA5 senses positive strand RNA viruses [13]. IPS-1 initiates the transcription factors IRF-3 and IRF-7 via TBK-1, IKKε, and also NF-κB [14]. Upon stimulation, constitutively expressed IRF-3 gets phosphorylated in the cytoplasm, dimerizes and translocates into the nucleus. Interaction with co-activators such as the CREB-binding protein (CBP) and p300 [15] promotes binding of the factor to the IRF-3-binding site within the IFNβ-enhanceosome and initiates induction of IFNβ gene expression upon IAV infection. Activation of the transcription factors NF-κB and activator protein-1 (AP-1), consisting of ATF-2/c-Jun heterodimers, possessing binding sites within the IFNβ-enhanceosome and are also required to induce IFNβ expression. IFNβ is secreted and binds to the type I interferon receptor to induce expression of IRF-7 that, in concert with other transcription factors such as IRF-9 and STATs, leads to induction of IFNα and other interferon induced genes in a secondary feedback [16].

Recently, the role of the NLR family as members of innate immunity effector molecules came into the focus of interest. NLR proteins are characterized by a hydrophobic leucine-rich motif, similar to TLRs and sense a wide range of PAMPs within the cytoplasm of infected cells (reviewed in ref. [17]). Although the exact regulating mechanism of NLRs in innate immunity is not fully understood, regulation and release of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18 have been reported. Another characteristic feature of NLRs is their ability to form central molecular platforms, such as inflammasomes that allow for example the activation of caspases [17]. NLRP3, also known as NALP3/cryopyrin/CIAS-1/PYPAF1 builds a caspase-1-activating inflammasome. Caspase-1 is able to process and activate pro-IL-1β, pro-IL-18 and pro-IL-33 and thereby regulates inflammatory response. Upon IAV infection the activated cryoporin inflammasome and caspase-1 induce IL-1β and IL-18 release preventing the extent of lung damage and epithelial necrosis [18]. Another study demonstrated that caspase-1 contributes to B-cell and T-cell responses upon IAV infection [19]. Lately, activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by IAV infection has been shown to trigger IL-1β release from human monocytes upon ssRNA or dsRNA stimulation [11].

### 3. Type I IFN stimulated gene products

Secreted IFNα/β bind to a ubiquitously expressed IFNα/β receptor (IFNAR) that upregulates the Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT)
pathway. The strong infection phenotype of IFNAR$^{-/-}$ mice demonstrated the efficacy of the type I IFN system, since these mice that are devoid of the central receptor are highly sensitive to viral infections [20]. JAK/STAT signaling induced formation of the trimeric transcription factor ISGF3, consisting of STAT1, STAT2 and IRF-9, which regulates the expression of several IFN stimulated genes, like MxA, p56, the $2'-5'$ oligoadenylate synthetases (OAS), and the protein kinase R (PKR) to name, but a few [21]. Further, IFN itself triggers expression of IFN-inducing proteins, such as RIG-I, IKKε and STATs via a positive feedback loop. IFN stimulated genes in general counteract IAV replication and spread by diverse mechanisms [2] and some of them are shortly described in the following Fig. 1.

### 3.1. The protein kinase R (PKR)

PKR is a dsRNA-dependent serine/threonine kinase that plays a key role in the antiviral response against IAV. PKR is constitutively expressed at a basal level that increases upon IFN treatment. Upon RNA binding to two dsRNA-binding domains, PKR dimerizes, which leads to its autophosphorylation and activation of enzymatic activity [3]. PKR inhibits the cellular translation-machinery by phosphorylation of the eukaryotic initiation factor $2\alpha$ (eIF2$\alpha$), which results in shutdown of cellular and viral *de novo* protein-synthesis [3]. In brief, phosphorylation of eIF2$\alpha$ impairs a GDP/GTP exchange, whereby less GTP-eIF2$\alpha$ is created to induce translation (reviewed in ref. [22]). Furthermore, PKR is able to regulate NF-$\kappa$B signaling and IFN stimulated genes, consequently amplifying IFN Fig. 1.

### 3.2. The $2'-5'$ oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)

The degradation of ssRNA by the IFN-inducible OAS/RNaseL-system is also a dsRNA-activated antiviral action [22]. OAS catalyses the synthesis of $2'-5'$ connected oligoadenylates commonly abbreviated as 2–5A. These 2–5A molecules bind the endoribonuclease RNaseL, which becomes activated and subsequently degrades viral and cellular RNA [22].

Taken together the interferon-inducible PKR and OAS/RNaseL-systems impair an efficient viral replication by creating an antiviral state within the cells.

### 3.3. The Mx proteins

Type I IFNs also induce the expression of the family of orthomyxovirus resistance gene (Mx) GTPases. The human MxA and B, and murine Mx2 are cytoplasmic proteins, whereas the murine Mx1 protein is localized within the nucleus (reviewed in ref. [23]). Mx proteins harbor a large N-terminal GTPase domain and a C-terminal leucine zipper (LZ) domain connected via a central interacting domain (CID). The LZ-domain and the CID-domain recognize viral structures [23]. Analysis of their antiviral action revealed that Mx1 interferes with primary transcription in the nucleus,

whereas MxA inhibits a posttranscriptional subsequent step that probably occurs in the cytoplasm of infected cells [24]. Both, Mx1 and MxA interact with subunits of the influenza virus polymerase-complex (PB2 and nucleocapsid protein (NP)), presumably leading to the blockade of efficient virus replication [23].

Recently, diverse sensitivity of IAV strains against antiviral action of Mx proteins was reported; avian IAV strains are more sensitive against Mx proteins than human IAV strains. In this context the viral NP was identified to be susceptible to Mx proteins, indicating that NP is a target of the Mx proteins [25].

#### 3.4. Viperin

Lately, the importance of other IFN induced gene products, such as Viperin (virus inhibitory protein, endoplasmic reticulum-associated, interferon-inducible) came into focus as antiviral agents within IAV infected cells [26,27]. Viperin expression leads to disruption of lipid raft microdomains at the plasma membrane by binding of farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPPS) and inhibits IAV replication at the final budding step [27].

## 4. Other cellular strategies to counteract IAV infection

Besides the powerful cytokine and chemokine expression countering IAV infection, the recognition of a mechanism termed RNA interference (RNAi) should also be mentioned. RNAi was discovered to control gene expression by degradation of the corresponding mRNA (reviewed in ref. [28]) and was considered as a protective mechanism in plants and nonvertebrate cells against virus infection (reviewed in ref. [29]). In context of IAV infection, RNAi was described to suppress replication [30], supporting the hypothesis that RNAi interferes with viral infection. However, little is known how IAV counteracts the antiviral function of RNAi. Lately, the role of Dicer, an RNase III type endonuclease, which is a key component of the RNAi machinery, was studied during IAV infection. Knock-down of Dicer resulted in increased IAV production and accelerated apoptosis in infected cells [31]. Nevertheless, the definite role of RNAi is still elusive and more efforts are required to clarify the role of RNAi in defense of mammalian hosts against IAV.

## 5. Viral strategies to counteract the innate immune signaling responses

Since IFN$\alpha/\beta$ expression is described as an early powerful response against IAV infection it is not surprising that these pathogens have coevolved gene products preventing IFN expression as well as IFN induced signaling [32], Fig. 1.

### 5.1. The non-structural protein NS1 — a viral antagonist of the innate immune response

To date the most extensively studied gene product of IAV that is known to interfere with the type IFN response is the

NS1 protein. The NS1 is encoded by the smallest of the eight gene segments of IAV together with the nuclear export protein NS2 (reviewed by ref. [33]).

Its IFN antagonistic effects became obvious in studies with an IAV mutant lacking the NS1 gene. This virus mutant was highly attenuated and only replicated efficiently in IFN-deficient systems [34]. Meanwhile, it is well accepted that the major activity of the NS1 protein is inhibition of IFN production and IFN induced effectors [33].

For a long time it was commonly accepted that the NS1 binds to and sequesters dsRNA from recognition by the PRRs [35,36]. However, recent data raises doubts whether dsRNA is really produced in influenza virus infected cells, since only small amounts are detectable [6]. The only factor that still is discussed to be inhibited by sequestration of dsRNA of NS1 is the IFN-inducible 2′–5′ OAS that in turn activates RNaseL [37]. Recently, it was shown that NS1 rather interferes with viral ssRNA harboring free 5′ triphosphate groups, a pattern that is recognized by PRRs [12].

Beside this action, NS1 proteins interact with cellular components that result in inhibition of antiviral, or stimulation of virus supportive mechanisms. One of the cellular NS1 interaction partners is RIG-I. Since the NS1 RIG-I interplay seemed to be independently of an RNA bridge, the molecular mechanism was enigmatic for a long time [12], until recently a new class of antiviral acting molecules, the tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins have been identified [38,39]. TRIM proteins are characterized by a conserved RBCC structure harboring an N-terminal RING domain, one or two B-box domains, a Coiled-coil domain and a variable C-terminus [38]. Within the increasing number of TRIM proteins, TRIM25 was shown to regulate RIG-I mediated antiviral activity via RING-finger E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [40]. In fact, human TRIM25 protein was recently identified as a NS1 binding protein, too [41]. Upon complex formation of NS1-TRIM25, the ubiquitination of RIG-I and its downstream signaling is inhibited [41].

Another cellular interaction partner of the NS1 protein is the phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K). Besides antiviral properties of PI3K resulting in the full phosphorylation and activation of the transcription factor IRF-3, also proviral functions have been described for this kinase. PI3K is induced in a biphasic manner upon IAV infection. The very early activation of PI3K is required for efficient virus uptake and probably induced by virus attachment to cellular receptors.
The late activation is induced by direct binding of NS1 to the regulatory subunit p85 of PI3K and responsible for the prevention of premature apoptosis (reviewed ref. [42]).

The adapter proteins CRK and CRKL were also identified as interaction partners for NS1 proteins harboring a specific class II SH3 domain binding motif located at aa 212–217 that are predominantly present in avian influenza virus strains [43]. Disruption of CRK/CRKL-NS1 interaction resulted in reduced PI3K activity. Based on these data the existence of a large “signalosome” of CRK/CRKL-p110/p85-NS1 was hypothesized [43], however, the precise role of this complex formation is still enigmatic.

Additionally, NS1 is able to inhibit type I IFN induction based on the interaction with components regulating mRNA transcription, processing and translation. Specifically, NS1 is able to bind to CPSF-30, the 30 kDa subunit of cleavage and polyadenylation specific factor, which inhibits polyadenylation of cellular mRNAs, but not viral mRNAs [44].

Besides the predominant inhibition of antiviral acting type I IFN response, NS1 is also able to interfere with other antiviral mediators. NS1 inhibited caspase-1 activation and therefore maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18, and caspase-1 dependent apoptosis in primary human macrophages [45]. In chicken macrophages, it was demonstrated that NS1 decreases Fas and Fas ligand (Fas/FasL) mediated apoptosis to increase infectivity upon avian IAV infection, probably mediated by PI3K signaling [46].

Another concept to counteract type I IFN response independent from the action of NS1 could be ascribed to the NF-κB signaling pathway. IAV induced NF-κB dependent SOCS3 gene expression suppressed type I IFN response on the level of JAK/STAT activation [47]. Further, inhibition of the NF-κB pathway results in a block of caspase-mediated nuclear export of viral RNPs and thereby suppresses IAV replication [48]. These findings lead to the intriguing implication that the NF-κB signaling pathway, which was earlier believed to mainly have an antiviral function, also has virus supportive effects.

### 5.2. The role of PB1-F2

The PB1-F2 protein is a second non-structural protein of IAV encoded by an alternative open reading frame of the PB1 segment. PB1-F2 was originally found during a search for alternative reading frame-peptides encoded by IAV, which are detected by CD8⁺T cells [49]. During the past years *in vivo* and *in vitro* studies identified several functions and effects of PB1-F2 in IAV infected cells [50]. PB1-F2 localizes at the inner and outer mitochondrial membrane and mediates higher susceptibility to apoptotic inducers, such as IAV infection [50]. Upon interaction of PB1-F2 with the mitochondrial membrane proteins ANT3 and VDAC1 cytochrome c is released via holes in the mitochondrial membrane [51]. Viruses with inactivated PB1-F2 reading frame had lower pathogenicity in mice by preventing viral clearance, probably due to its proviral function in immune cells [52]. Additionally, it has been reported that PB1-F2 contributes to the severity of secondary pneumonia infection with *Streptococcus pneumoniae* [53], which underlines its role as a potent pathogenicity determinant in mice. However, none of these results provides a molecular mechanism that would explain the dysregulation in the cytokine response caused by the action of PB1-F2 leading to the infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils into the infected lung in mice [50]. One possible explanation of increased cytokine levels in infected lungs is based on the observation that PB1-F2 directly interacts with the PB1, which leads to an enhanced viral polymerase activity and consequently to enhanced RNA accumulation [48].

Recently PKC mediated PB1-F2 phosphorylation was shown to enhance the induction of apoptosis in monocytes [54]. Since, this phosphorylation does not significantly influence the levels of IFNα/β induced MxA proteins, probably the cell-type specific pro-apoptotic effect acts virus supportive [54]. Taken together, PB1-F2 functions are still poorly understood. Although PB1-F2 exerts properties of a virulence factor until now it could not directly be linked to cell intrinsic factors of the innate immune system.

## 6. Interference of IAV with host cell signaling pathways — the MAPKs

So far, four mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades have been identified comprising two isoforms of the extracellular signal regulated kinase (ERK1/2), the Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK), p38, and ERK5. These cascades convert different extra- and intracellular signals into cellular responses, regulating proliferation, differentiation, cell activation, and immune responses. Activation of the MAPKs occurs through dual phosphorylation on threonine and tyrosine residues by upstream MAPK kinases (MKK). JNK and p38 predominantly react to stress conditions and proinflammatory cytokines, whereas ERK5 can be activated by both mitogens and stress inducers and ERK1/2 sense mitogenic stimuli. Additionally, it has been shown, that all four MAPK cascades are induced after IAV infection [16].

While JNK, p38 and ERK5 fulfill antiviral functions in IAV infected cells, ERK1/2 is essential for efficient virus replication. JNK phosphorylation is triggered upon IAV infection and leads to activation of the AP-1 transcription factors ATF2 and c-Jun, which are critical to regulate not only the expression of IFNβ- and RANTES but also apoptosis. IAV induced p38 activation results in chemokine-release, such as RANTES and IL-8. Moreover, cytokines like TNF are induced via p38 upon infection with highly pathogenic avian IAV. So far, the function of IAV induced ERK5 activation is still unclear, since it does not affect IAV replication [55].

JNK, p38, and ERK5 but not ERK1/2 can be induced by dsRNA-like structures and ssRNA harboring 5′ triphosphate ends. Taken into account, that the signaling pathways JNK, p38, and ERK5 can be induced by RNA-like structures it is not surprising that these pathways are overinduced by delNS1 viruses carrying a deletion of the complete NS1 coding region [55]. Activation of ERK1/2 correlates with expression of the viral HA and its accumulation in lipid raft-like structures [56]. Activation of ERK by HA containing lipid raft-like structures
was further dependent on the protein kinase C α (PKCα) and resulted in induction of viral RNP export. Therefore, the PKCα/Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is probably activated late during replication, when virus assembly and budding is prepared [56]. Consistent with the observation that ERK1/2 is not induced by RNA-like structures it is not hyper-activated by delNS1 infection [56].

Besides the already described virus supportive function of the Raf/MEK/ERK signaling cascade, latest results introduced a downstream target of this pathway, the ribosomal protein S6 kinase alpha 2 (RSK2), as antiviral effector [57]. Knock-down of RSK2 reduced viral polymerase activity and growth of IAV and antiviral responses through NF-κB, IFNβ and PKR [57], providing another example for pro- and antiviral function ascribed to one and the same signaling pathway.

Besides the above discussed strategies developed by the virus and the host to manipulate each other, a new class of molecules representing cellular inhibitors of the host defense (CIHD) came into focus.

P58<sup>IPK</sup> is a cellular inhibitor of PKR, which is activated during IAV infection to reduce IAV induced inflammation and apoptosis to prolong host survival [58]. P58<sup>IPK</sup> mediated PKR inhibition reduced caspase activation and eIF2α phosphorylation resulting in suppression of apoptotic responses. In addition, PKR-mediated NF-κB activation was decreased by p58 and prevented activation of IFN stimulated genes [58].

## 7. Conclusion and outlook

In recent years a number of findings helped to unravel some of the cellular recognition mechanisms and signaling responses to IAV infection as mechanisms to counteract viral replication. A plethora of studies has increased our knowledge on viral proteins interfering with cellular signaling cascades to support viral replication as it was demonstrated for HA and NS1, or to suppress antiviral immune response as known for NS1. However, more efforts may help to unravel the mechanisms that collectively regulate the delicate balance between replication enhancing and host cell defense programs. Elucidating viral escape mechanisms will provide possibilities to choose specific host cell functions as targets to develop new therapeutics against IAV infections. Furthermore, additional viral targets for antiviral intervention may also emerge. Recently, reverse genetic approaches suggested that live attenuated influenza viruses containing NS1 truncations can be used as vaccines against highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [59]. These recombinant viruses induced higher levels of IFN and therefore were more attenuated in mice [59]. Novel chemical inhibitors targeting NS1 were able to reverse the inhibition of IFN mRNA induction during infection and thus exhibited antiviral activity [60]. Future studies of promising antiviral acting attempts will certainly follow.
