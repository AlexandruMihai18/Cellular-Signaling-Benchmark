### 1. Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an idiopathic, fatal neurodegenerative disease affecting motor neurons. Approximately 2 people in 100,000 are affected by the disease in the US and in Europe and therefore it is considered to be a rare orphan disease.

ALS causes the death of cortical and spinal neurons that control the voluntary motions of muscles. The cause of ALS is not known in 90–95% of cases while familial inherited causes have been identified in 5–10% of cases. Numerous environmental factors have been considered as possibly contributing to the development of the neuropathological changes associated with ALS and other neurodegenerative disorders such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease or frontotemporal dementia [1,2]. The risk factors that are most commonly associated with these disorders include smoking, exposure to heavy metals or pesticides, radiation and certain types of physical activity. Physical activities linked with ALS involve sports with a high risk of head injuries [3]. It has also been suggested that calorie restriction may have a detrimental effect on motor neurons, contrary to the beneficial effects observed for neurons in the hippocampus [4]. Mattson et al. [4] hypothesized that motor neurons may not be able to respond adaptively to energetic stress due to reduced ability to upregulate stress-resistant proteins. Mutations of superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) have also been associated with familial ALS [3].

The clinical onset of the disease usually starts at around age 60 and the survival time is around 2–4 years. The age of onset for familial ALS is about a decade earlier than for sporadic cases [3].
It is very difficult to determine a specific date for the onset of the disease and the potentially long duration between onset of pathological changes and the manifestation of the clinical disease. This is probably due to the redundancy of motoneurons that can take over the function of the dying neurons without manifesting any symptoms and indicates the need for early diagnosis. There is an urgent need to understand the possible causes of the early degeneration and death of neurons as it can be related also to other serious and more frequent neuronal diseases such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

### 1.1 Clinical phenotypes and prognosis

ALS is caused by a selective and progressive loss of spinal, bulbar and cortical motor neurons that leads to irreversible paralysis, to speech, swallowing and respiratory malfunctions, and eventually to the death of affected individuals in a rapid disease course.

The neuron loss causes atrophy and eventually paralysis of skeletal muscles because of the lack of communication between the nervous system and voluntary muscles. Because of the inactivity of the muscles, significant weight loss occurs and eventually the muscles involved in breathing are paralysed, which is the common cause of death.

There are various symptoms of ALS and they differ in the development status of the disease progression. The identification of the specific phenotype has important implications for the patients as it determines the prognosis and their survival. The main phenotypes of ALS include: limb-onset ALS with a combination of upper and lower motor neuron (UMN and LMN) signs in the limbs; bulbar-onset ALS presenting itself with speech and swallowing difficulties with the limb features developing later; the less common primary lateral sclerosis with pure UMN involvement; and progressive muscular atrophy, with only LMN involvement.

A typical presentation of ALS is the presence of UMN and LMN features involving multiple spinal cord regions of innervation. Patients can have the bulbar-onset disease (about 25%) or limb-onset disease (about 70%) or can have an initial trunk or respiratory involvement (5%). Atypical modes of presentation can include weight loss, which is an indicator of a poor prognosis, cramps, emotional lability and frontal lobe-type cognitive dysfunction.

ALS is highly progressive—50% of patients die within 30 months of symptom onset and about 20% of patients survive between 5 and 10 years after the onset of symptoms. Some ALS subtypes tend to lead to a better
prognosis; for example, flail-limb variants of ALS and progressive muscular atrophy. Both are predominantly LMN forms of ALS characterized by slower progression.

The origin and causes of ALS are not clear. There are several hypotheses explaining the pathology and progression of ALS changes. The ‘dying-forward’ hypothesis proposes that ALS is mainly a disorder of corticomotoneurons, which connect monosynaptically with anterior horn cells mediating anterograde degeneration of anterior horn cells via glutamate excitotoxicity. The ‘dying-back’ hypothesis proposes that ALS begins within the muscle cells or at the neuromuscular junction. Specifically, there is a deficiency of motor neurotrophic hormone, which is normally released by postsynaptic cells and retrogradely transported up the presynaptic axon to the cell body where it exerts its effects. The third hypothesis proposes that the upper and lower motor neuron degeneration occur independently.

## 1.2 Molecular mechanisms of ALS

Multiple genetic and molecular pathways are possibly involved in the development and progression of neurodegenerative changes in ALS. Fig. 1 presents several selected cellular and molecular processes which are proposed to mediate neurodegeneration in ALS [3]. It is supposed that the mechanism is multifactorial involving interrelated molecular and genetic pathways, such as glutamate excitotoxicity, generation of free radicals, cytoplasmic protein aggregation, SOD1 enzymes, mitochondrial dysfunction and disruption of axonal transport processes. These processes are discussed in this review.

The neurodegeneration in ALS may result from the complex interaction of glutamate excitotoxicity, the generation of free radicals, cytoplasmic protein aggregates, SOD1 enzyme mutation in combination with mitochondrial dysfunction, and disruption of axonal transport processes through the accumulation of neurofilament intracellular aggregates. Cytoplasmic protein aggregation has been related to mutations in TARDBP and FUS genes. TDP-43 (transactive response DNA binding protein) mutations have also been found in patients with both sporadic and familial ALS [5].

The process by which motoneurons die is unclear. Mutation of the superoxide dismutase (SOD1) (see Fig. 2) gene has been observed in 5% of the ALS patients with familial ALS. Mutation in the gene encoding SOD1 has been described as the most common cause of ALS. SOD1 misfolding and aggregation of the misfolded protein can be observed which

eventually leads to neurodegenerative changes. Transgenic mice over-expressing human SOD1 enzyme are used as an animal disease model for investigational ALS drugs.

However, SOD1 mutations are not solely involved in the ALS pathogenesis and several inter-related mechanisms are suggested [6]. Transgenic mice, null for SOD1, do not develop motoneuron degeneration nor do those with overexpressed human wild-type SOD1, indicating that SOD1 is not necessary or sufficient to develop ALS [7].

Fig. 3 illustrates the multiple possible mechanisms that are involved in the development of ALS. Glutamate acts on several receptors and it is eliminated by the astrocytic excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT2). The activation of glutamate receptors leads to the influx of calcium. The calcium influx leads to activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and the subsequent production of NO free radicals. Superoxide and NO can generate peroxynitrite free radicals that nitrosylate proteins leading to damage. The neurofilaments are target to this damage. Therapeutics targeting these possible pathways could be valuable in stopping the development and/or progression of ALS.

Although numerous pathological mechanisms have been proposed, there is no proven target for medicinal chemists when designing new molecules to have an impact on the disease. Several molecules that target the above-mentioned potential pathways have failed so far in clinical trials and therefore efforts in this field have not provided any breakthrough in

developing new medicines [8]. It is very likely that multiple mechanisms are involved, and that potential new active molecules should probably target several pathways in order to successfully alter the motor neuron degeneration process. In this review, the potential pathways are discussed that lead to the development of motor neuron degeneration and that have been targeted to cure or at least slow down the development of the fatal form of the disease.

The only drug that has been approved by the FDA in the past 20 years is Riluzole, which can increase the ALS patients’ life by 2–3 months by blocking glutamatergic neurotransmission in the CNS. Riluzole inhibits the release of glutamic acid from cultured neurons in brain slices, and from corticostriatal neurons in vivo. A further 22 years elapsed before another drug was found to be effective in altering ALS progression: the antioxidant edaravone [9,10]. However, the mechanism of action of edaravone in ALS is not fully understood.

There is an obvious unmet medical need to slow down the disease progression, lengthen the life expectancy, and ultimately cure ALS patients. Another important achievement would be the development of prophylactic approaches preventing the development of ALS.

2. Potential cellular signalling pathways that could be targeted for the treatment of motoneuron diseases

As discussed, the pathogenesis of ALS is poorly understood and that has resulted in a lack of successful therapy options for patients suffering from this debilitating condition. There are several hypotheses describing the involvement of certain cellular signalling pathways in the development and progression of ALS. It has been proposed that the development of neurodegenerative disorders is associated with the dysfunction of adaptive stress response in several cellular signalling pathways [11]. The ‘stress response system’ involves various conserved cellular signalling pathways that have evolved to protect neurons from different forms of biological stresses (metabolic, proteotoxic, inflammatory and oxidative). Intermittent challenges, including fasting, vigorous exercise or certain phytochemicals, may stimulate some of these pathways that result in building cell resilience [12].

In the case of familial ALS, several new loci linked to the disease have come to light. A form of autosomal dominant juvenile ALS is characterized by slow progression, distal limb amyotrophy and pyramidal tract signs that have been linked to chromosome 9q34. This chromosomal region is likely to contain at least one gene concerned with the survival of motor neurons [13].

Autosomal recessive ALS usually has a juvenile onset and progresses slowly. Type 3 ALS, which has predominantly upper motor neuron (UMN) involvement and affects limb, face and tongue muscles, has been linked to chromosome 2q33. Type 1, which is a more common form, is characterized by lower motor neuron (LMN) involvement of the hands and feet spreading to the bulbar muscles, and has recently been linked to chromosome 15q15–q22 markers [14]. Candidate gene studies are an attractive way forward to understand the origin of the disease. Two percent of ALS cases have mutations in the SOD1 gene and approximately 1% have deletions in the gene of the heavy neurofilament subunit (NFH).

Mutations in the FUS (fused in sarcoma) gene, which are a major cause of juvenile forms of ALS, are linked to the loss of motor neurons. Sekic-Zahirovic et al. [15] have found that these mutations also affect other cell types in the brain. High levels of FUS, in either the normal or mutant forms, kill motor neurons, and certain mutations change the protein’s location, which might impair the normal functioning of neurons. Researchers were able to turn off mutant FUS in specific cell populations using genetic tools.
The expression of mutant FUS in motor neurons was turned off but left intact in other brain cells such as oligodendrocytes. These cells support and protect motor neurons by creating a myelin layer around them to ensure that electrical signals go through a motor neuron to a muscle cell. Turning off mutant FUS in motor neurons protected these cells from death, proving that this abnormal form of FUS is key to triggering motor neuron damage and death.

Mutations in TARDBP and FUS result in intracellular aggregation. The TARDBP gene provides instructions for making a 43kDa transactive response DNA binding protein. This protein, TDP-43, is found within the cell nucleus in most tissues and is involved in many of the steps of protein production. It binds to DNA and regulates transcription, as the first step in the production of proteins from genes through messenger RNA. TDP-43 mutations have been found in patients with both sporadic and familial ALS [16].

The exact process by which motor neurons die still remains unclear but several inter-related mechanisms are proposed which are discussed below.

### 2.1 Superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene mutation

Although ALS is mostly sporadic, with over 90% of cases occurring without a family history of the disease, it has become evident that in many sporadic cases alteration of proteins has been found that are similar to familial cases and therefore might increase the probability of developing ALS. As noted earlier in some familial cases, a dominant autosomal inheritance pattern is caused by mutations in superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1).

The SOD1 enzyme, which constitutes 1% of total brain protein in humans, is encoded by the SOD1 gene in the 21 chromosomes. The deleterious effects of the various mutations on SOD1 are probably mediated through the toxic function of the enzyme, rather than a loss of dismutase activity or a dominant negative effect. While as noted earlier, transgenic mice studies have indicated that under- or over-activity of SOD1 is not sufficient or necessary for an ALS phenotype in contrast, mice overexpressing the human mutant SOD1 develop motor system pathology, suggesting that another property of the enzyme is responsible. It is presumed that as all SOD1 mutations result in an autosomal dominant phenotype of ALS with similar pathological features, all must work through the same mechanism. This mechanism could be the enhancement of protein nitrosylation by mutant SOD1 or exposure to toxic copper at the active site, or accumulation and aggregation of altered or abnormal proteins including SOD1.
2.2 Protein nitrosylation

Peroxynitrite (ONOO⁻) is a toxic intermediate generated non-enzymatically by the reaction between superoxide anions (O₂⁻) and nitric oxide (NO) at a rate three times faster than the dismutation of the superoxide anion by SOD1. NO is generated by nitric oxide synthase (NOS), which is a calcium-dependent enzyme. Therefore, NOS is prone to activation by excitotoxic mechanisms such as the glutamate excess.

Patients with sporadic ALS have higher cerebrospinal fluid levels of 3-nitrotyrosine and the 3-nitrotyrosine to tyrosine ratio goes up sevenfold suggesting an increased level of oxidative stress and the nitrosylation of proteins. In the spinal cord of mice transgenic to human SOD1 with the G93A mutation, the expression of inducible and possibly of neuronal NOS is increased, which may lead to an increase in the local concentration of NO and therefore to motor neuron death [17]. It was also demonstrated that during the course of the disease, the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) increased. In both early symptomatic and end-stage transgenic mice expressing mutant human superoxide dismutase (mSOD1), numerous cells with the appearance of glial cells are strongly iNOS-immunoreactive. Neuronal nitric oxide synthase expression was only seen in neurons in the spinal cord of transgenic mSOD1 mice, regardless of the stage of the disease, when comparing age-matched transgenic mice expressing normal SOD1 and wild-type mice. The authors suggested that the observed alterations do not initiate the death of motor neurons but may contribute to the propagation of the neurodegenerative process. Furthermore, the upregulation of iNOS, which in turn may stimulate the production of nitric oxide, provides further support to the presumed deleterious role of nitric oxide in the pathogenesis of ALS. This observation also suggests that iNOS may represent a valuable target for the development of new therapeutic avenues for ALS treatments.

2.3 Peroxidase activity

Mutant SOD1 has greater peroxidase activity than wild-type SOD1 and this effect can be inhibited by copper chelators. Oxidative stress may be the result of the aberrant metal chemistry of the mutant enzyme [18].

2.4 Neurofilaments and relationship to SOD1

Neurofilaments are type IV intermediate filament heteropolymers composed of light, medium, and heavy chains (NFL, NFM, and NFH).
Neurofilaments compose the cell ‘exoskeleton’ functionally maintaining the neuronal calibre, and are part of the slow axonal transport system. They may also play a role in the accumulation of neurofilaments in the proximal cell body and perikaryon of motor neurons which can be observed in ALS. Transgenic mice expressing the human SOD1 mutants G37R and G85R show a slowing of axonal transport at least 6 months before the onset of the clinical features of the disease. Peripherin, another intermediate filament protein, interacts under normal circumstances with NFL and assembles with the neurofilament structure. In the absence of NFL, it interacts with the medium and high neurofilament subunit, creating and accumulating in a disorganized neurofilament network. Peripherin is expressed earlier than the other three neurofilaments and exhibits a distribution pattern identical to NFL, NFM, and NFH in sciatic axons [19]. Contrary to the widely held view that peripherin and the neurofilament triplet are separate, it has been demonstrated that despite the postnatal decline of peripherin expression, it is abundant and exists in a relatively fixed stoichiometry with these subunits [19]. Genetically deleting NFL in mice dramatically reduces the peripherin content of axons. Studies on transgenic mice show that this can occur when a relative increase in peripherin occurs in conjunction with a relative decrease in NFL (as might occur after nerve injury or in response to inflammatory cytokines), and that this can result in neurofilament aggregation, which leads to motor neuron death. These observations show that neuronal intermediate filaments may play a major role in ALS pathogenesis.

## 2.5 Phosphorylation sites and oxidative stress

Cyclin-dependent kinase-5 (cdk5) phosphorylates neurofilaments generating the same epitopes as those found in neurofilament accumulations in ALS. In addition, cdk5 is present in some of the accumulations and is found in affected motor neurons in ALS in association with lipofuscin, a protein associated with oxidative stress and ageing. Additional evidence for the theory that oxidative stress causes neurofilament damage, resulting in neurofilament accumulation and ALS, comes from the work on advanced glycosylation end-products (AGE). These are the result of the non-enzymatic reaction of reducing sugars with biological molecules leading to irreversible glycation. Neurofilaments are very susceptible to this process as they are long-lasting, and it is thought that AGE-mediated neurofilament crosslinking occurs at an early stage in ALS.Another recently emerging nuclear factor, the erythroid 2 (NFE2)-related factor 2 (Nrf2), is a member of the cap ‘n’ collar (CNC) subfamily of basic region leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factors. Nrf2 was cloned by virtue of its binding to the NFE2-binding motif, a *cis*-regulatory sequence in the β-globin locus control region necessary for erythropoiesis and platelet development. It was found to mediate induction of a set of drug-metabolizing enzymes (DMEs), such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and NAD(P)H: quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1), by antioxidants and electrophiles. A major emerging function of Nrf2 from studies over the past decade is its role in resistance to oxidative stress [20]. Several studies support a protective role of Nrf2 against neurodegenerative diseases. Crossing mice that overexpress Nrf2 with two ALS mouse models showed a significant delay in the onset of ALS and extended survival of the mice with ALS [21]. Nrf2 KO mice were significantly more sensitive to MPTP (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine) induced Parkinson disease (PD)-like lesions, which were alleviated by overexpression of Nrf2 in astrocytes [22].

### 2.6 Excitotoxicity

Cell death resulting from pathological stimulation by the excitatory amino acids aspartate and glutamate (see Fig. 3) has been proposed for many neurodegenerative conditions. Excitotoxic mechanisms are also implicated in ALS because cerebrospinal fluid levels of glutamate are increased up to threefold in 80% of patients when compared with controls. To prevent excitotoxicity caused by excessive extracellular glutamate, the excitatory amino acid transporters (EAAT) remove it.

AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) and NMDA (*N*-methyl-*D*-aspartate) receptors often coexist in the same synapse. At resting membrane potential, a weak synaptic stimulation only activates AMPA while NMDA does not respond. Intracellular Ca²⁺ accumulation results in glutamate-induced neurotoxicity and therefore NMDA has received less attention as a potential pathway to neurotoxicity, although its critical role in ALS has been emphasized by Spalloni et al. [23].

### 2.7 Glutamate transporter

EAAT2 is a glutamate transporter expressed solely on astrocytes. Levels are reported to be reduced in the cortex and spinal cord of patients with ALS compared with controls, and this is apparently because of aberrant mRNA
transcripts [24]. However, other studies [25] have shown increased cerebrospinal fluid glutamate in only 30% of patients and that aberrant transcript may also be found in normal controls. Oxidative reactions triggered by hydrogen peroxide and catalysed by mutant SOD1 in transgenic mice with the A4V and I113T mutations inactivate EAAT2. Wild-type SOD1 does not do this. The inactivation of EAAT2 results in neuronal death, suggesting that SOD1 mutants mediate toxicity through an excitotoxic mechanism. Further evidence for this theory comes from the spinal motor neurons of G93A transgenic mice, which exhibit increased sensitivity to glutamate toxicity, probably through increased levels of oxidative stress and enhanced calcium responses to glutamate.

## 2.8 Mitochondrial involvement

One marker of mitochondrial DNA damage is the demonstration of cytochrome *c* oxidase activity followed by succinate dehydrogenase activity. A study [26] of six patients with ALS and six controls, as well as a patient with known multiple mitochondrial DNA deletions, has shown that in ALS the spinal cord is cytochrome *c* oxidase deficient. This was not seen in controls but was seen in the patient with the known mitochondrial deletions and may have been caused by multiple mitochondrial DNA damage.

## 2.9 Protein aggregation

Protein misfolding and protein aggregation are known characteristics of various diseases, including major neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS, Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. While the mechanistic link between protein aggregation and cell degeneration remains unclear, approaches to halt or reverse the aggregation process are a focus of current drug discovery. Modifying the underlying disease processes by targeting protein aggregation is different from the currently available symptomatic treatments for Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases.

## 2.10 The involvement of the insulin receptor and IGF1 in motor neuronal disorders

Over the past 30 years, glucose intolerance has been reported in a significant percentage of ALS patients. A reduction in glucose receptor space has been postulated for a number of neuromuscular diseases [27]. The biological roles of insulin-like peptides (ILP) have been conserved since metazoans developed the first nervous system; however, their functions have expanded.
This is the result of an increased number of insulin receptors in higher species like rodents and humans. In mammals, there are three ILP receptors in the brain. The IGF1 receptor and the insulin receptor can form functional hybrids that have similar affinities to IGF1 and insulin, indicating a cooperation. The IGF2 receptor does not bind insulin. It is interesting to note that the adult brain in rodent has a reduced number of ILP receptors in comparison to the development stage. ILP receptors are produced at a high level in neurons, glia, epithelia and endothelia in the main brain areas in the developmental stage of rodents. It is interesting to understand the mechanism by which the insulin-like peptides can enter into the brain. Fernandez and Torres-Alemán [28] explained in their review the active transport processes that ensure that insulin-like peptides reach their receptors in the brain as shown in Fig. 4.

The signalling pathways of ILPs in mammals and their connections to regulate phosphorylation processes and control the energy allocation are shown in Fig. 5. It is postulated that the insulin receptor and the IGF1 receptor may form a hybrid receptor in the membrane that can bind IGF1 and which is modified allosterically by the presence of ILP. These membrane receptors then regulate the phosphorylation of various kinases such as PI3K, GSK2, mTOR SOD that affect protein translation, autophagy, apoptosis, oxidative stress, gene transcription and proliferation among others. Therefore, insulin-like peptides may play a role in various neurodegeneration processes through oxidative stress, gene transcription, apoptosis, autophagy and protein aggregation.

The structurally related peptides, insulin and insulin-like growth factors IGF1 and IGF2, have neurotrophic properties and potentially could have therapeutic values in human neurodegenerative disorders [29]. Dore et al. [30] compared the anatomical distribution of IGF1, IGF2 and insulin binding sites in the thoracic spinal cords from patients who had died of ALS and normal controls.

For these three ligands, the largest amounts of specific binding were located with the following distribution. They were highest in the deeper layers of the dorsal horn, which were greater than the intermediate zone, which was greater than lamina X, itself greater than in the ventral horn, in turn greater than superficial layers of the dorsal horn, which was finally greater than in the white matter of the spinal cord. Highly significant $(P < 0.001)$ increases in the density of IGF1 and IGF2 binding were apparent in various laminae of the cord of ALS patients, with increased binding being particularly evident in the ventral horn and the intermediate zone.

revealed significant increases in both IGF1 and IGF2 binding levels in the spinal cords of ALS patients. These findings may be of relevance for future therapeutic strategies aimed at slowing the progression of this chronic neurodegenerative disease, as recently suggested [30] by the beneficial therapeutic effects of an IGF1 treatment in ALS patients.

Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF1) receptors are present in the spinal cord. As members of the neurotrophin receptor family, IGF1 receptors mediate signal transduction via the tyrosine kinase domain. IGF1 was found to prevent the loss of choline acetyltransferase activity in embryonic spinal cord cultures, as well as to reduce the programmed cell death (PCD) of motor neurons in vivo during normal development or the following axotomy. IGF1 enhances motor neuronal sprouting in vivo. Subcutaneous administration of IGF1 increases muscle endplate size in rats. Doses of IGF1 that accelerated recovery from sciatic nerve crush in mice resulted in elevated serum levels of IGF1 which are similar to those obtained following subcutaneous injections of formulated human recombinant IGF1 (Myotrophin) in normal human subjects [30,31].

The insulin receptor is a transmembrane receptor that is activated by insulin, IGF1 and IGF2 and belongs to the large class of tyrosine kinase

receptors. The cytoplasmic domain of the human insulin receptor from a baculovirus expression system (BIRK) is a soluble, constitutively activated protein-tyrosine kinase. In a cell-free system, BIRK is phosphorylated on serine and threonine residues [30]. BIRK can therefore be used for in vitro screening of potential drug molecules to predict their binding to insulin receptors.

### 2.11 Neuron trophic growth factors and their potential therapeutic use in ALS

Fig. 6 shows the potential pathways that connect the insulin receptor and brain-derived neuron trophic factors to neurodegeneration.

Several studies in developmental neurobiology have identified signalling pathways that regulate the outgrowth of axons, promote synapse formation and encourage cell survival. In most cases, these pathways involve neurotrophic factors (NTFs) that can activate or downstream signalling pathways involving several kinases such as Akt, JNK and GSK. Several hormones have also shown neurotrophic actions, for example, insulin.

There are a number of well-characterized trophic factors for the CNS, such as the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), the insulin-like

growth factor (IGF1), the ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and the nerve growth factor (NGF). Several of these have been tested for neuro-protective potential [32]. These trophic factors play an important role in the development and the survival of motoneurons.

Nerve growth factor (NGF) was discovered by Levi-Montalcini and co-workers some 70 years ago [33] for which they later received the Nobel prize [34]. This supported the concept that secreted molecules produced by the target of a developing neuron are required for it to survive programmed cell death. The neurotrophic factor concept states that a neurotrophic molecule secreted by innervated tissue can be taken up by axon terminals. These molecules are available only in limited amount and enable only those neurons to survive that have successfully established synaptic contacts with their target cells. Those neurons that are lacking the trophic support die by apoptosis. The neurotrophic factor concept was built on the experimental evidence from studies of purified neurotrophic factors shown to have the capacity to increase the survival and neural growth of paravertebral sympathetic neurons. NGF is synthesized by the target cells of these neurons. These factors have been shown to act in vitro and in vivo.

Originally the neurotrophic factors were proposed for the peripheral nervous system, and later they have been extended to the central nervous system (CNS). The neurotrophic hypothesis provides the background for the identification of NTFs. A candidate NTF is added to or removed from a specific neuronal population exhibiting PCD. It was shown to affect the survival of neurons recorded by measuring the number of healthy and dying neurons. Studies in the field of intracellular cell death process led to the identification of many key molecules whose activity was required for the passage of a cell through apoptotic, programmed death states [35]. After focusing on the nature of NTFs as extracellular signalling to regulate PCD, subsequent studies established that neurons dying during the developmental PCD activate a programme of genes. NTFs rescue neurons from PCD by inhibiting this programme. The effects of NTFs and anti-PCD molecules on the survival of motor neurons during development soon led to the idea that they might ameliorate neurodegenerative disorders such as ALS and thereby be an aid in the treatment of those suffering from these diseases [36]. The neurotrophic factors were reviewed previously [37,38] reporting that the neurotrophic factors can be found in all types of neurons, whereas the receptors have a more limited distribution. The function of neurotrophic factors is to mediate adaptive responses of neurons to stress.

The presence of dying neurons in the developing nervous system was noted over a century ago but not appreciated until nearly half a century later,when Hamburger and Levi-Montalcini [33] noted that the number of neurons dying during development varied depending upon the size of the target field [39]. Further evidence of a relationship between peripheral factors produced and the number of dying neurons was provided by Hamburger [39], who observed a large increase in the number of dying sensory neurons and motoneurons several days after the surgical removal of their target limb.

These studies suggested that extracellular, target-derived molecules definitely regulate motoneuron survival during PCD. The discovery of NGF as such a sympathetic factor for a subset of sensory neurons provided more specific evidence that the neurotrophic hypothesis was valid. Moreover, it was demonstrated that NGF was produced by the target of these neurons [40], and was retrogradely transported from the target to their cell bodies [41,42]. The biochemical isolation and survival-promoting effects of a second trophic molecule structurally related to NGF and the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) also supported this idea [43]. The discovery of multiple NTFs in addition to the neurotrophins allowed this idea to be further tested in motor neurons. In contrast to the results obtained with neurotrophins and CNS granule cells, the removal of single NTFs resulted in the loss of subpopulations of motor neurons.

Genervon Biopharmaceutical LLC has discovered and patented [44–46] a motoneuron trophic factor (MNTF) and its analogues to treat several neurodegenerative diseases, such as AL, PD and AD. The MNTF and the analogue peptides have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic part of the tyrosine kinase insulin receptor (BIRK) which will be discussed later.

### 3. Current markers and animal models used to evaluate the effect of new therapeutics in ALS

#### 3.1 Immunoblot and immunohistochemistry

Analysis of spinal cord tissue lysates before and after treatment, and after treatment with control, has been carried out using western blot analysis. Various phosphorylation sites (for example P38) can be detected by applying polyclonal antibodies on the size-fractioned proteins protected by protease inhibitors. Fig.7 shows a western blot analysis illustrating the effect of caffeic acid phenyl ester in an ALS mouse model [47].

before and after treatment. The immunohistochemical staining can visualize the number of motor neurones that can be compared with wild-type and treated animals' spinal cord.

## 3.2 Potential biomarkers

A good diagnostic test that is characteristic of ALS would enhance the early detection of ALS so that disease-modifying treatments could be applied earlier providing more chance of survival. Neurofilament heavy chain proteins may provide a promising biomarker in ALS disease progression. They are present in large myelinated neurons and are composed of at least three poly-peptide subunits [48]. It has been observed that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) has an increased level of neurofilaments in ALS patients compared to patients with other neurodegenerative diseases and it is proposed that the phosphorylation of neurofilaments is indicative of ALS pathogenesis [48].

Transglutaminase enzymes activity in the CSF of ALS patients is elevated at early stages of the disease which can be a useful biomarker, though at terminal stages of the disease the activity decreases.

## 3.3 SOD1 mutagenic mouse model

Currently, male and female transgenic mice overexpressing the human SOD1-G93A gene are used as a mouse model for ALS. Usually beginning at 90 days of age, the onset of the motor neuron weakness can be observed using a rotarod apparatus. The disease onset can be determined when the animal becomes unable to remain on the apparatus. Then by grouping the animals to form control and treated groups with various doses of potentially active compound, their performance on the Rotarod device is evaluated for a period of time to detect efficacy. The survival days after the disease onset can also be recorded. Typical test results are shown in Fig. 8 from Ref. [47].

## 3.4 Improved preclinical screening and potential biomarkers

It has been observed that several investigational drugs that extended the life expectancy of SOD1 transgenic mice failed to show efficacy in human clinical trials even if they had excellent pharmacokinetic and toxicological characteristics [49,50]. These include riluzole, creatine, celebrex, thalidomide and dexpramipexole [50]. The ALS Therapy Development Institute (ALSTDI) has suggested a guideline for preclinical studies in order to reduce the false positive assessments based on animal models. The emphasis should be on the motor neurons and motor neuron survival should be investigated in patient-isolated fibroblasts in vitro [51]. Recent developments, which enable the visualization of diseased motor neurons, have the potential to bring novel insight. As the focus is changed from mice to motor neurons, it may be possible to introduce a new vision that translates into effective and long-term treatment strategies in ALS.

Another approach is to use model systems in which motor neurons mimic disease pathology at a cellular level. Mouse motor neurons can be used as they are almost identical to human motor neurons at a cellular level, and they also offer great versatility because of various transgenic approaches. Disease reporter lines with fluorescently labelled motor neurons can be generated that provide an invaluable investigative tool for the study of the survival of motor neurons [49].

There are numerous genetic developments revealing cellular mechanisms that affect motor neurons [52]. For example, patients with mutations
in KIFAP3, DCTN1, and NEFH genes would be most likely to suffer from axonal transport defects, whereas patients with mutations in VCP, VAPB and SQSTM1 will have increased endoplasmic reticulum-stress and protein accumulation defects.

From the developing insight of the pathophysiology of ALS it has become clear that even though the patients display similar pathological symptoms, the underlying molecular and cellular mechanisms may be very different. This shows a similarity to cancer and heart disease in that one drug may not provide the solution to all ALS patients. This should be taken into account in designing a clinical trial. The realization of the heterogeneity among patients should be included in the selection criteria together with gender, age and location of the disease onset.

### 4. Current medicinal chemistry approaches

The recent advances in drug discovery methods have not been found useful in the search for new ALS therapeutics. Structure-based design and high throughput screening approaches require a well-defined and validated target, preferably with a crystal structure to also enable virtual screening. The lack of a prominent target for ALS prevents the use of these advanced methodologies. Several mutations in certain genes are known to lead to protein aggregation and toxicity resulting in the manifestation of ALS. However, the causes of mutations and why these mutations result in protein aggregation are still not known. The identification of the root cause of the degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons would improve the chances of identifying new compounds that can be used as therapeutics in ALS. Keeping these limitations in mind, medicinal chemistry efforts have been categorized based on the mechanisms by which they are aiming to improve ALS, and these are summarized in the following section.

#### 4.1 Compounds acting on gene expression of SOD1

The most common cause of ALS is a mutation of the gene encoding the antioxidant enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD1). One of the most important proposed hypotheses includes glutamate excitotoxicity, structural and functional abnormalities of mitochondria, impaired axonal structure or transport defects and free radical mediated oxidative stress. Although they play a critical role in neurodegeneration, these are the secondary effects in the causes behind ALS onset.

Several compounds related to various mechanisms that can be associated with ALS have been tested in SOD1 transgenic mice. One compound,
1,3-diphenylurea, has been patented specifically for its ability to reduce the amount of SOD1 gene expression. This compound acts differently from bromocriptine and ceftriaxone discussed later but they arguably have a similarity in their structure.

![1,3-Diphenylurea](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

![Ceftriaxone](https://i.imgur.com/ABCDEFG.png)

![Bromocriptine](https://i.imgur.com/HJKLMNO.png)

The latter two drugs are heterocyclic and contain exocyclic amide groups. Ceftriaxone contains a beta-lactam ring while bromocriptine contains a gamma-lactam ring. These motifs may be associated with their neuroprotective properties.

Nimesulide is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and analgesic drug. It has been patented [53] as a potential ALS drug because it may provide a prophylaxis for patients that are at risk of developing ALS. It may be administered at other stages during the progression of the disease. It has a multifactorial mode of action and blocks prostaglandin synthesis. Another patent [54] claims that low doses of diazoxide improve the symptoms of

ALS and extend the survival rate by acting on the K<sub>ATP</sub> channel as an opener. It is a vasodilator which works by activating the potassium channel that causes the dilatation of muscles. It is also known as a positive allosteric modulator of AMPA. The chemical structure of nimesulide and diazoxide both contains bicyclic ring systems. Nimesulide contains a phenoxyphenyl group while diazoxide features a benzothiadiazine ring. They both have sulphonamide groups that might be involved in their potency against ALS.

### 4.2 Compounds affecting protein nitrosylation

Pathologically activated therapeutics have been described by Lipton [55] that can be related to S-nitrosylation and inhibition of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. The drugs used target neurological diseases that are mediated at least in part by excitotoxicity. Excitotoxicity is defined as excessive exposure to the neurotransmitter glutamate or overstimulation of its membrane receptors, leading to neuronal injury or death. Excitotoxic neuronal cell damage is mediated in part by overactivation of NMDA glutamate receptors, which results in excessive Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through the receptor-associated ion channel and subsequent free radical formation. Potential neuroprotective agents that block the NMDA receptor activity will probably have unacceptable clinical side effects. For this reason, many previous NMDA receptor antagonists have disappointingly failed advanced clinical trials for a number of neurodegenerative disorders. The adamantane derivative, memantine, preferentially blocks excessive NMDA receptor activity without disrupting normal activity. Memantine does this through its action as an uncompetitive, low-affinity, open-channel blocker.

Minocycline, a tetracycline antibiotic, has been reported to act positively in patients with schizophrenia [56]. The exact mechanism of action is not known; however, it exhibits indirect inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase and functionally exacerbates apoptotic neurodegeneration induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 in mouse model studies. Minocycline has been recently suggested to be a positive modulator of the GluA1 subunit receptors of AMPA, in addition to inhibiting microglial activation, decreasing nitric oxide synthase and having anti-apoptotic properties. Although it has been previously suggested that AMPA antagonists may offer neuroprotection, Black [57] stated that some positive AMPA modulators increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor production, which in turn has been reported to have neuroprotective effects. Furthermore, AMPA receptors are distinguished on the basis of subunit composition (GluA1–4) and isoform conformation. The subunit composition of the AMPA receptor shows striking discrepancy across the brain [57] and has different properties depending on the AMPA subunit or splice variant complement. Consequently, the clinical effect of an AMPA modulator may vary according to the action of different subunits [58].

## 4.3 Anti-oxidative compounds altering peroxidase activity

The oxidative stress-related cell death of motoneurons may also be related to ALS. A patent provides the use of an FDA approved drug, bromocriptine mesylate, to treat ALS [59]. Bromocriptine is a free radical scavenger that may inhibit oxidative stress-induced cell death. It is an ergoline derivative, a dopamine agonist that is used for the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, neu- roleptic malignant syndrome and type II diabetes. The patent indicates that bromocriptine delays the deterioration of motor function and prolongs the survival of ALS-SOD1 transgenic mice.

![Pramipexole](https://i.imgur.com/1234567.png)

![Edaravone](https://i.imgur.com/2345678.png)
![Creatine](https://i.imgur.com/3456789.png)
![Melatonin](https://i.imgur.com/4567890.png)

Cellular oxidative stress due to mitochondrial dysfunction is another proposed mechanism associated with motor neuron degeneration in ALS. Pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, which has free radical scavenging properties. In order to reduce the affinity for dopamine receptors, the optical enantiomer that has less dopaminergic activity (Dexpramipexole) was given at a high dose to ALS-SOD1 transgenic mice. It demonstrated a prolonged lifespan and it also met the safety and tolerability criteria in a clinical trial [60]. The drug failed to show efficacy in terms of function or survival of patients with ALS as reported by Biogen Inc.

Another compound, 3-methyl-1-phenyl-2-pyrazoline-5-on—edaravone, has been patented [61] for the treatment of motor neuron degeneration as it acts as a free-radical scavenger by suppressing lipid hyper-oxidation. As a result, the muscle weakness disappears, and the bicep muscle mass is increased. A first clinical trial was not successful, but a second trial was achieved by selecting the responding cohort of patients that showed significant improvement after 24 weeks of the treatment. The FDA approved this drug for ALS, but it remains unclear as how to select ALS patients that would positively respond to the treatment without proven biomarkers.

Creatine is a naturally occurring guanidine derived compound that is synthesized endogenously in humans in the liver and is found predominantly in muscle and brain. Additional doses of creatine may increase energy output in anaerobic activities and can also stimulate mitochondrial respiration and phosphocreatine synthesis [62]. These mechanisms may help explain the apparent neuroprotective properties of creatine seen in a transgenic mouse model of ALS, as well as some reports of increased energy in patients with ALS [63]. Beneficial effects of creatine on muscle fatigue have been demonstrated in patients with a variety of muscular dystrophies [64]. It was also shown that the neuroprotective effect of creatine was additive with COX2 inhibitors [63]. The survival increase in mouse models was reported as 146% as a single agent but 30% in combination. However, a clinical trial failed for creatine alone and the combination of creatine with COX2 inhibitors has not been tested clinically.

Melatonin is another endogenous compound that has been tested in an ALS mouse model. It was found that melatonin attenuates the glutamate-induced cell death of cultured motoneurons. In SOD1 transgenic mice, high-dose oral melatonin delayed disease progression and extended survival (7.4%). In a clinical safety study, chronic high-dose (300mg/day) rectal melatonin was well tolerated during an observation period of up to 2 years.
The circulating serum protein carbonyls, which are elevated in ALS patients and used as a marker for oxidative stress, were normalized to control values after melatonin treatment. Based on these positive preclinical findings and proven safety in humans it would appear that high dose melatonin is suitable for clinical trials aimed at neuroprotection through antioxidation in ALS [65]. Melatonin has also shown an anti-apoptotic effect demonstrating inhibition of the intrinsic apoptotic pathways in neurodegenerative diseases, including stroke, Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, Huntington’s disease, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis [66]. However, no clinical trial has yet been performed.

### 4.4 Potential for compounds affecting neurofilaments

C-terminal neurofilament phosphorylation mediates cation-dependent self-association leading to neurofilament incorporation into the stationary axonal cytoskeleton. Multiple kinases phosphorylate the C-terminal domains of the heavy neurofilament subunit (NF-H), including cyclin-dependent protein kinase 5 (CDK5), mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), casein kinase 1 and 2 (CK1 and CK2) and glycogen synthase kinase 3b (GSK3b). The respective contributions of these kinases are not clear because they phosphorylate multiple substrates [67]. The MAPK pathway and CDK5, but not CK1 and GSK3b, inhibited neurofilament proteolysis. These findings indicate that phosphorylation of neurofilaments by the proline directed MAPK pathway and CDK5 counterbalances the impact of phosphorylation of neurofilaments by the non-proline directed CK1 and GSK3b. Consequently certain kinase pathway modulators may provide a neuroprotective effect through this mechanism.

### 4.5 Compounds acting on phosphorylation (kinases)

A new therapeutic target, TAR DNA binding protein, TDP-43, was identified in 2008. This is a nuclear inclusion in the brains of patients with frontotemporal lobar degeneration with ubiquitinated inclusions (FTLD-U) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [68]. Previous studies reported that abnormal phosphorylation takes place in deposited TDP-43. The phosphorylation sites and responsible kinases that play the pathologically significant role in the phosphorylation of TDP-43 have been identified using antibody technology. Structurally, the antibodies labelled abnormal fibres of 15nm diameter, and on immunoblots, recognized hyperphosphorylatedTDP-43 at 45 kDa in sarkosyl-insoluble fractions from FTLD-U and ALS brains. The results suggest that phosphorylated TDP-43 plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of FTLD-U and ALS. Pathological TDP-43 phosphorylation seems to drive the progression of ALS and may result from the upregulation of protein kinase CK-1 in the affected neurons. Salado et al. [69] searched for brain penetrant specific CK-1 inhibitors as a potential new therapeutic target for ALS. They have identified compounds with IC₅₀s in the μM or lower range among N-Benzothiazole-2-phenylacetamides for which two example structures 1, 2 are shown.

It is essential for small molecules to cross the blood-brain barrier and the cell membrane to be active in the brain and inside the cell as kinase inhibitors. The blood-brain penetration of CK-1 inhibitors has been characterized using the PAMPA-BBB method. The efficacy of the compounds has been tested on Transgenic TDP-43 fruit flies and they showed a protective effect against neurotoxicity. As TDP-43 phosphorylation was observed in sporadic ALS, some 90% of cases, it opens up the possibility of helping the majority of patients by using orally active brain penetrant compounds.Tamoxifen is an important drug used in the treatment and prevention of breast cancer because it is a selective oestrogen-receptor modulator (SERM). Its effectiveness depends on the P450 2D6 enzyme creating the active metabolite endoxifen, 4-hydroxytamoxifen. It is also believed that tamoxifen affects the most important factor in the regulation of angiogenesis, the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Therefore, it is considered that the drug prevents tumour-induced angiogenesis. Its neuroprotective action is probably due to its ability to inhibit protein kinase C, which mediates inflammation in the spinal cords of patients with ALS. It has shown some positive effects in ALS patients [70,71]. The drug was well tolerated in clinical trials of both sexes, and data from an extended follow-up period suggested that patients receiving 20–40mg per day may have longer survival compared to patients receiving only 10mg per day [70].

### 4.6 Compounds affecting excitotoxicity (AMPA receptors)

Talampanel is an orally active non-competitive antagonist of the AMPA receptor that was shown to be related with glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. The AMPA receptors are a subtype of ionotropic glutamate receptors that are known to be involved in the pathogenesis of neuronal death in sporadic and partially familial ALS [72,73]. The chemical structure of Talampanel is shown above. In vivo studies of SOD1 mice models support the beneficial effects of AMPA antagonists such as talampanel. However, the neuroprotective effects of talampanel were only detected when it was applied in the early stages of the disease. Although the efficacy measurements did not show significant differences on the ALS functional rating scale, muscle strength and timed hand movements declined at a slower rate in talampanel-treated patients [74].

Talampanel has a similar structure to benzodiazepines that were used to reveal the three non-competitive binding sites of the AMPA receptor [75] as shown in Fig. 9.

The 2,3-benzodiazepines that are inhibitors of AMPA receptors showed no appreciable cross activity on either NMDA or kainate receptors. However, there exists a trend that if a compound is inhibitory on AMPA receptors, the potency is generally in the rank order of GluA2≈GluA1≫GluA3≈GluA425 [75]. Spinal motor neurons that undergo neurodegeneration in ALS actually express GluA3 and GluA4, in addition to GluA1 and GluA235. Thus, if the molecular properties of both the AMPA

receptors and talampanel are used for selecting a single inhibitor as a drug candidate for ALS clinical testing, talampanel is not ideal. It has been reported [76] that pairing a thiadiazole moiety with a 2,3-benzodiazepine scaffold via the N-3 position yields an inhibitor type with a 428-fold better potency and selectivity on AMPA receptors than either a 2,3-benzodiazepine scaffold alone or talampanel [76]. This result suggests that the ‘side pocket’ surrounding the ‘M’ site on the receptor is able to accommodate a larger size of the N-3 derivative such as a thiadiazole, such as in compounds 3 and 4. One such compound characterized was shown to inhibit GluA1, 2Q, 3 and 4 AMPA receptors with roughly a Kᵢ value of

about 0.5mmol/L. It also inhibited equally strongly both the closed-channel and the open-channel forms of these AMPA receptors. Solving the structure of the AMPA receptors would provide additional help for medicinal chemists to design selective inhibitors and to study the receptor involvement in ALS.

Penicillin Core

## 4.7 Compounds influencing glutamate transport

There is evidence that patients with ALS have reduced glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1), which might lead to the decreased elimination of glutamate from neuromuscular synapses. It has been shown that many beta-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin, its derivatives, and cephalosporins, upregulated the levels of GLT1 [77]. Ceftriaxone was also reported to have neuroprotective properties by reducing glutamate excitotoxicity via the stimulation of the promoter sequence for GLT1 [78].

This effect maintained muscle stability and weight for a longer period and moderately increased lifespan. Phase I and II clinical trials have indicated a good pharmacokinetic profile, safety, and tolerability. High and low doses of Ceftriaxone achieved the desired concentration in the CSF and it was tolerable up to a 4g dose per day.

Topiramate

SA4503 (Cutamesine)

Olesomime

Arimoclomol

Topiramate is an anticonvulsive drug approved by FDA in 2012 and used to treat epilepsy. It blocks the kainate and AMPA glutamate receptors and therefore it was expected to slow the progressive deterioration of motor function in subjects with ALS. Topiramate protected motor neurons in an in vitro model of chronic glutamate toxicity in a dose dependent fashion; therefore, it has been subjected to clinical trials in ALS patients. The primary outcome measure was the change in upper extremity motor function after 12 months of experimental therapy as tested with quantitative neuromuscular examination. Secondary outcome measures include grip strength, forced vital capacity, the ALS functional rating scale, and the safety and tolerability of topiramate. Unfortunately the clinical trials failed [79]. At the dose studied, topiramate did not have a beneficial effect for patients with ALS. High-dose topiramate treatment was associated with a faster rate of decline in muscle strength as measured by MVIC and with an increased risk for several adverse events in patients with ALS. Given the lack of efficacy and large number of adverse effects, further studies of topiramate at a dose of 800mg or maximum tolerated dose up to 800mg/day were not advised.

4.8 Compounds preventing mitochondrial dysfunction

SA4503 (cutamesine) acts on the sigma-1-receptor which is highly expressed in tissues including the central nervous system [80]. The main function of the receptor is the control of Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the mitochondria, which prevents mitochondrial dysfunction. Mutations in the gene of the sigma-1 receptor have been identified as a cause of familial juvenile ALS [81]. Oxidative stress and inflammation are also believed to make a contribution to the pathogenesis of ALS and are also attenuated by sigma-1 receptor agonists. The compound showed a positive effect in vitro and in vivo in SOD1 transgenic mouse and it has been shown to affect the PI3K pathways that play an important role in the proliferation and activation of factors that protect neuronal cells [82].

Olesoxime is a mitochondrial pore modulator originally developed by Trophos SA and then put in clinical trials by Roche for ALS as a neuroprotective compound. It is an experimental drug belonging to the cholesterol-oxime compound family [83]. It has a cholesterol-like structure and displays neuroprotective properties. It has been shown to be as effective as a cocktail of three neurotrophic factors in keeping motor neurons alive in culture [84]. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that the compound promotes the function and survival of neurons and other cell types under disease-relevant stress conditions through interactions with the mitochondrial permeability transition pore. It is presently in Phase III clinical trial for ALS as a mitochondrial pore modulator.

4.9 Compounds affecting protein aggregation

ALS is also characterized by abnormal protein aggregation. The heat shock proteins (HSPs) belong to the cellular defence mechanisms with neuroprotective effects against aggregates. Arimoclomol, a hydroxylamine derivative, acts as a heat shock response inducer [74]. Studies have demonstrated that this drug therapy improved muscle function on the SOD1 mouse model at both early and late stages of the disease [74, 85]. Therefore, arimoclomol might be a promising therapy at early stages, but the clinical efficacy in human would still need to be proved.

4.10 Compounds showing positive effects on potential new targets

Caffeic acid phenethyl ester (CAPE) extended the survival of ALS-SOD1 transgenic mice [47]. This compound has an anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative property protecting neurons.

AAD-2004 from GNT Pharma Co. Ltd. is also in a clinical trial for ALS, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease [86] where it behaves as a potent spin trapping molecule also acting as a microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 inhibitor.

Dextromethorphan is an opioid most commonly used as antitussive. In palliative care of ALS patients, it was observed that it had a positive effect on bulbar function and a clinical trial has been carried out [87].

The dextromethorphan is used in combination with quinidine to reduce demethylation by blocking the P450 CYP2D6 enzyme. The clinical study was unique, because it was driven by patient reports of improved speech and swallowing while taking a combination of dextromethorphan and quinidine for control of emotional lability. The study was conducted over a short duration (70 days), and a self-report scale was selected as the principle outcome measure. The combination therapy is narrowly indicated for treatment of pseudobulbar affect and bulbar symptoms in ALS.

Pentoxifylline is a xanthine derivative that is used in treating patients with peripheral artery disease and pain in the legs. The drug slowed down the disease progression and increased survival by 10% in a mouse model, but the clinical trials in ALS patients failed [88].

# 4.11 Anti-inflammatory compounds

Increasing evidence suggests that inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of motor neuron death in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Important mediators of inflammation such as the cytokine tumour necrosis factor (TNF) and its superfamily member fibroblast-associated cell-surface ligand have been involved in apoptosis. Therefore several anti-inflammatory drugs have been tested in the SOD1 mouse models such as thalidomide and lenalidomide [89]. Treatment with either thalidomide or lenalidomide attenuated weight loss, enhanced motor performance, decreased motor neuron cell death, and significantly increased the lifespan in SOD1 transgenic mice. Thalidomide has been subjected to human clinical trials [90] that eventually failed due to sinus bradycardia in ALS patients [91], while lenalidomide has not been subjected to clinical trials.

**Pioglitazone**

Pioglitazone is an antidiabetic drug that also shows anti-inflammatory properties as an agonist of PPAR-γ [92]. It belongs to the thiazolidinedione family used to treat type II diabetes. It modulates the transcription of the genes involved in the control of glucose and lipid metabolism in the muscle, adipose tissue, and the liver. In the ALS mouse model it delayed the disease onset and an 8–13% improved survival was observed; however, human clinical trials failed.

4.12 Motoneuron trophic compounds

The trophic factors as modulators have been recently reviewed by Tovar-y-Romo et al. [32]. The development of neurons and their survival depends on tightly regulated support from trophic factors. These trophic factors can regulate important physiological processes, such as neuronal differentiation, neuronal survival through inhibition of apoptosis, neurogenesis and axonal outgrowth. Trophic support is essential for neurons in the spinal cord and other cellular sources such as astrocytes, microglia, neurons and endothelial cells. Therefore, trophic support can be a potential therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.

There are several previously identified trophic factors for the CNS, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor, insulin-like growth factor 1, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), glial-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), nerve growth factor, growth hormone and vascular endothelial factor (VEGF). Many of these have been tested for neuroprotective potential in various experimental models of ALS. Viral vectors encoding growth factors are among the most effective ways to delay the progression of degenerative processes and extend the survival of ALS mice [93]. The different trophic factors alter the development of motor neurons in various ways. For example, the absence of GDNF alters the location of the developing motor neurons that innervate limbs in the spinal cord [94]. On the other hand, BDNF may not be as important for motor neurons [95], because motor neurons are able to develop without major alteration despite a lack of BDNF [38]. The absence of CNTF does not alter motor neuron development at the spinal and cranial levels. The absence of cardiotropic-1 has been reported to produce a significant loss of motor neurons [96]. The neurotrophic factors are also important during development, and they regulate motor neuron maintenance and survival even after the neuron is fully differentiated. Among all the trophic factors tested in ALS models, VEGF has been shown to be the most potent motor neuron protector. VEGF significantly slows down the progression of the disease and the loss of motor neurons in both familial and in sporadic experimental models. The activation of VEGF receptor 2 triggers the phosphorylation of the intracellular pathways driven by PI3K and MEK (mitogen-activated protein kinase). VEGF also mediates neuroprotection through the inhibition of stress-activated protein kinases like p38 [97].

Clinical trials administering trophic factors to ALS patients have not yet been successful. Subcutaneous administration of CNTF and BDNF did not

improve ALS patients' life expectancy though they showed favourable effects in mouse models. Two randomized double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trials administering recombinant human IGF showed little or no effect on disease progression, though IGF1 was found to be protective in a transgenic rodent model of ALS [31]. The lack of success of the trophic factors in clinical trials can be associated with the time of administration after symptom onset. Trophic factors have a short time frame for protection of motor neurons. This is supported by histological studies of human spinal cord that showed a large variability between the degree of motor neuron loss and muscle weakness. A similar result was obtained in rats subjected to spinal AMPA-induced excitotoxicity, in which a delayed administration of VEGF clearly protected the neurons but only when administered before the onset of motor neuron loss.

Although trophic factors are essential components of neuron survival there is also a need to understand the molecular pathways that cause growth factor shortage during the course of disease. Proper therapeutic regimens and treatment approaches are needed in order to translate the findings from the experimental models to useful clinical therapeutics.

The granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) showed neurotrophic properties and improved outcomes in ALS transgenic mice [98]. The protein is clinically well tolerated and crosses the intact BBB. This study examined the potential role of G-CSF in motoneuron diseases. The expression of the G-CSF receptor in motoneurons has been studied in a motoneuron cell line and in the SOD1(G93A) transgenic mouse model. The neurotrophic growth factor was applied by continuous subcutaneous delivery. This study showed that when given at the stage of the disease where muscle denervation is already evident, G-CSF leads to significant improvement in motor performance, delays the onset of severe motor impairment and prolongs overall survival of SOD1(G93A) transgenic mice. The G-CSF receptor is expressed by motoneurons and G-CSF protects cultured motoneuronal cells from apoptosis. In ALS mice, G-CSF increased the survival of motoneurons and decreased muscular denervation atrophy. The survival in the mouse model was increased by 7% [98] but G-CSF has not been progressed to clinical trial.

The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has also been shown to attenuate gliosis and motoneuronal degeneration in transgenic mouse models [99]. Histological and immunohistochemical analyses of tissues from G93A/HGF mice revealed a marked decrease in the number of microglia and reactive
astrocytes and an attenuation of motoneuron loss in facial and hypoglossal nuclei compared with G93A mice. The dose dependent survival in mouse models increased by 18% and clinical trials were ongoing in 2015 [100].

The effect of human Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) on the progression of ALS has been reported by Lai et al. [101]. The clinical trials unfortunately failed or were non-conclusive [102]. A splice variant of IGF1, the mechano-growth factor, has been shown to rescue motor neurons and to improve muscle function in the SOD1 mouse model [103]. However, no clinical trials have been performed.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was more successful in reducing astroglisis and preserved the neuromuscular junctions in ALS transgenic mice [103]. It was also shown to prevent paralysis and motoneuron death in a rat model of excitotoxic spinal cord neurodegeneration [104]. Clinical trials were carried out in 2015.

The motor neuron trophic factor (MNTF) is a 33-amino acid peptide, originally isolated by screening a retinoblastoma cDNA library with antibodies to extract it from the muscle of 3 week old rats [45]. MNTF peaks in expression during week 9 in human foetal gestation. Based on the expression of MNTF in the developing human and its tropic properties in vitro and in vivo, it was reasoned that MNTF may promote differentiation and/or survival of motor neurons from embryonic stem cells [105]. Addition of MNTF to embryonic stem cell cultures resulted in the expression of mature motor neuron transcription factors (e.g. HB9), expression of the mature motor neuron marker choline acetyl transferase (ChAT), and the generation of neurons capable of conducting action potentials [106]. It appears that MNTF acts via an Shh-independent pathway to induce differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells into motor neurons, although Shh or other hedgehog components (such as Dhh, Ihh) may still mediate some effects of MNTF in adult neurons [107].

Genervon Biopharmaceuticals LLC has patented novel peptides and compositions containing portions of the MNTF-molecule that are useful for modulating the viability and proliferation of neuronal cells [105]. These novel peptides are derived from a specific protein domain of general significance to the actions of motoneuron trophic factors. It has been shown that they are sufficient to modulate the viability and proliferation of neuronal cells. Moreover, truncated MNTF1 species encompassing these domains are themselves sufficient to stimulate the growth of motoneuron/neuroblastoma cell hybrids in cell proliferation assays. It was shown that these peptides,the subunits of the MNTF protein, are capable of modulating growth of neuronal cells in vitro or in vivo to individuals suffering from nerve injury or a neurodegenerative disorder. The explanation is based on the hypothesis that the master regulator for differentiation of the human nervous system must be endogenous in order to be able to bind to a specific receptor.

GM6, a 6 amino acid analogue of the MNTF active site, has been subjected to more detailed characterization. GM6 is a cationic linear peptide drug consisting of Phe-Ser-Arg-Tyr-Ala-Arg as an acetate salt [105]. This peptide acts on the beta-subunit Insulin Receptor Kinase which plays an important role in the pathways of the embryonic stage MNTF with an $IC_{50}$ of $9.2 \times 10^{-4} \mathrm{M}$. Competitive binding studies have shown that GM6 does not inhibit insulin binding to the insulin receptor, but it does have a positive allosteric binding, increasing the efficacy of the receptor towards insulin. The role of insulin and its receptor in the brain has been recently reviewed [108] and it has been suggested that the insulin receptor in the central nervous system plays a role in Alzheimer’s disease.

The potential of GM6 peptides as biopharmaceutical therapeutic agents has been investigated using biomimetic HPLC methodology [109]. GM6 has shown drug-like properties and is expected to partition into tissues and brain extensively [110]. In spite of the larger molecular weight, GM6 is not as hydrophilic as in silico calculations predict. Its CHIlogD value is $-0.016$ and it is bound reasonably well to proteins and phospholipids producing an estimated volume of distribution of $7.8 \mathrm{~L} / \mathrm{kg}$ [110,111]. This suggests that GM6 distributes to tissues extensively. The intracellular concentration of GM6 has been estimated as five times higher than the extracellular concentration in equilibrium [110]. These estimates have been confirmed using immunostaining techniques, which showed that GM6 partitions into the brain and inside the cell.

GM6 was tested in binding to the human insulin receptor (IR) which is a **transmembrane receptor** that is activated by **insulin**, IGF1, IGF2 and belongs to the large class of **tyrosine kinase receptors** [112] as discussed in Section 2.10. It has also been shown that GM6 does not act as a substrate for BIRK but as an inhibitor. In order to differentiate between the two, GM6 was biotinylated at one end and was used to replace the standard substrate showing that GM6 is not a substrate.

The hypothesis that GM6 is a multi-target motoneuron trophic molecule has been supported by immunoimaging and systems biology studies [107]. In contrast to existing ALS drug candidates, GM6 was not designedto selectively interact with a single receptor target, but rather appears to interact with multiple receptors linked to diverse pathways. Identified from RNA-seq expression profiling in SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cells, these receptors include Notch receptors 1–4, patched 1, and smoothened frizzled class receptor. Stimulation of these and other receptors by GM6 leads to induction of genes associated with Notch Intracellular domain and mitogen-activated protein kinase signalling [107]. These signal transduction pathways converge upon a core network of transcription factors such as HES family bHLH transcription factor 7 (HES7), GLI family zinc finger 1 (GLI1), homeobox D11 (HOXD11), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3). These transcription factors together modulate expression of thousands of genes. In neurons, GM6-regulated genes are associated with neurogenesis, nervous system development, neuron differentiation, axon development, extracellular matrix, leukocyte proliferation, and immune response. Gene expression responses to GM6 are thus linked to both neurogenesis and anti-inflammatory effects. It was further shown that GM6 alters the expression of 77 genes associated with ALS [107].

In vivo, GM6 has shown good drug-like properties and is expected to partition into tissues and brain extensively [110]. Effects of GM6 have therefore been investigated in more complex in vivo mouse models as well as humans. GM6 increased survival and conferred dose-dependent improvements in physical performance measures of disease progression and biomarkers in CSF and spinal cord sections. In humans, a Phase IIA randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot trial of GM6 in 12 ALS patients showed positive results with IV administration of the peptide [113]. Although findings from this study do not yet demonstrate efficacy, the study revealed several promising trends in GM6-treated patients, including slowed decline in forced vital capacity and in the ALS Functional Rating Scale, along with decreased plasma abundance of ALS biomarkers (e.g. TDP-43, Tau and SOD1). Taken together these findings have supported the hypothesis that GM6 favours neuron survival in ALS patients, slowing symptom progression and promoting a biomarker profile consistent with less severe disease. To date clinical trials with several other neuroprotective peptides, such as HGF, IGF1 and VEGF, have failed [102,104].

### 4.12.1 Potential of peptide therapeutics

There are several sets of experimental evidence that suggest peptides such as MNTF may provide a new modality for the development of therapeutic agents to improve ALS patients’ life expectancy. However, in developing
peptides as therapeutic agents, several hurdles would have to be overcome to produce a successful drug.

Biological peptides are found as selective and efficacious signalling molecules such as hormones, neurotransmitters, growth factors and ion channel ligands. There is an increased interest in synthetic and biological peptides in pharmaceutical research and over 140 peptide therapeutics are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. There are several issues with peptide therapeutics that have to be resolved. They are water soluble, but their oral absorption is compromised by hydrolysis occurring in the gastrointestinal tract. Proteolytic enzymes can decompose peptides quickly even when they are injected into the bloodstream, causing a short plasma half-life. Due to their polar nature, they often have limited cell permeability.

The rational design of peptide therapeutics can start with a crystal structure that provides both the secondary and tertiary structure. By replacing certain amino acids and using SAR, a small focused library can be easily built and developed. The other aspect of the rational design of peptide therapeutics is to improve their physicochemical properties, such as solubility and stability and to avoid aggregation. The stability of peptides can be improved by stabilizing α-helices, salt bridges or lactam bridges. Due to the low oral bioavailability of peptides, various formulation strategies have been developed such as liquid formulations for infusion. The search for non-conventional administration routes such as inhaled, topical and intravenous are potential options to improve bioavailability.

Another potential problem with peptide therapeutics is their limited cell permeability. There are potentially three mechanisms by which peptides can enter into the cell: The inverted micelle model; Direct penetration and Endocytic uptake [114]. When the target is intracellular it is important to design cell penetrating peptide therapeutics.

A short plasma half-life is typical of potential peptide therapeutics. Approaches to extend the plasma half-life include substitution of cleavage sites by other amino acids, or to change the folding through enhancement of the secondary structure of the peptide. It is common to use lactam bridges, cyclization and acylation. Another approach is to increase the serum albumin binding of peptide therapeutics and potentially increase the plasma half-life by esterification of long-chain fatty acids [115,116].

It is also possible that pharmacologically active peptide therapeutics do not necessarily have to have long plasma half-lives. Short peptides containing <10 amino acids primarily degrade in the plasma by blood and tissue proteases and therefore their metabolism does not depend on the liver

or kidney. This is an advantage as drug-drug interactions are less likely to take place. Studying the PD profile of potential peptide therapeutics showed potency between 8 and 76h after dosing. This data suggests that a persistent change in the cell, triggered by the treatment, resulted in an immune modulation effect.

However, the best delivery option would be the oral route and not the intravenous or sub-cutaneous route as is often used for peptide therapeutics. Various formulation technologies have been reviewed including PEGylation, reversible lipidation, hyper-glycosylation, and lipid drug delivery [117,118]. Fig. 10 shows some of the potential mechanisms for lipid drug delivery [118].
The key to the success of peptide drugs is their inherently good potency, selectivity and safety profile. Future research should focus on improving their bioavailability, plasma half-life, stability and cell permeability without compromising their safety.

### 4.13 Stem cells and immunotherapy

Stem cell therapy is a promising tool for the treatment of ALS as stem cells have the potential to grow to motor neuron cells. Mouse embryonic stem cells can generate spinal cord motor neurons and can receive and make synapses with muscle [119–122].

One of the factors that contributes to the development of ALS includes oxidative stress and the accumulation of free radicals as a consequence of the mutation of the SOD1 enzyme. Based on this pathogenic process, immunotherapy has been initiated using mouse monoclonal antibodies against misfolded forms of mutant SOD1. It was shown that the antibody D3H5 administered ICV for 42 days reduced the levels of toxic SOD1 in the spinal cord and the treated mice maintained weight for a longer period of time. The lifespan of ALS-SOD1 mice was also extended [123–125].

### 5. Summary of current approaches and future directions

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is caused by the selective and progressive loss of spinal, bulbar and cortical motoneurons and leads to irreversible paralysis, speech, swallowing and respiratory malfunctions with the eventual death of the affected individual in a rapid disease course.

Several suggested mechanisms have been reviewed such as SOD1 gene mutation, protein nitrosylation, phosphorylation and oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, glutamate transporter deprivation, mitochondrial involvement, protein aggregation and motor neuron trophic factors. The role of insulin and its receptor in the brain has been recently reviewed [108] and it has been suggested that the insulin receptor in the central nervous system plays a role for example in Alzheimer’s disease. It is very possible that in the 90% of ALS cases that are sporadic the cause of the motor neuron degeneration is different, or that multiple mechanisms are involved.

Several authors [71,126–128] have reviewed recent approaches and current perspectives of this field. Two drugs have been approved by the FDA for the treatment of ALS: riluzole, a neuroprotective drug that blocks glutamatergic neurotransmission, and most recently edaravone an anti-oxidant.Several marketed drugs have been selected for clinical trials. The results showed [70] that only three drugs had significant benefit in ALS: riluzole, talampanel and tamoxifen. Edaravone, a drug later approved by the FDA, was not included in this study. The results for the IGF1 neurotrophic factor were inconclusive. Some compounds have been discussed that showed a positive effect in the mouse model but failed in clinical trials. This is probably because the SOD1 mouse model may represent only the 10% of ALS cases that are of the familial type.

New approaches using new modalities such as peptides, proteins and stem cells are promising. However, there is a need for better bioavailability and the development of new formulations for administration to avoid regular i.v. injections for ALS patients. The invention of motor neuron trophic peptides and proteins may provide a new way of approaching the treatment of ALS and other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease. Investigating the endogenous factors in neuron death, protein aggregation and oxidative stress would enhance understanding of the potential pathways resulting in neurodegeneration and would enhance our ability to design better drugs.

It is also important to design the clinical studies more appropriately in ALS [129]. Novel biomarkers of diagnostic, predictive, prognostic, and pharmacodynamic value are undergoing development and validation for use in clinical trials. Novel designs aim to minimize patient risk, study duration, and sample size, while improving efficiency and promoting new statistical approaches.

There is a significant unmet medical need to find a cure for this rare disease. Table 1 provides an overall summary of the compounds that have been studied together with the supposed mechanism and the results of clinical trials with literature references.
