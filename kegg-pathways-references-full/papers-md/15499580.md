### Summary

Neurotrophins (NTs) are {AUTHOR} a family of structurally related, secreted proteins that regulate the survival, differentiation and maintenance of function of different populations of peripheral and central neurons. Among these, BDNF (brain-derived neurotrophic factor) has drawn considerable interest because both its synthesis and secretion are increased by physiological levels of activity, indicating a unique role of this neurotrophin in coupling neuronal activity to structural and functional properties of neuronal circuits. In addition to its classical neurotrophic effects, which are evident within hours or days and which usually result from changes in cellular gene expression, BDNF exerts acute effects on synaptic transmission and is involved in the induction of long-term potentiation. Many of these rapid effects of BDNF are mediated by its modulation of ion channel properties following TrkB-mediated activation of intracellular second messenger cascades and protein phosphorylation. However, recent reports have shown that BDNF not only acts as a modulator of ion channels, but can also directly and rapidly gate a Na⁺ channel, thereby assigning BDNF the properties of a classical excitatory transmitter. Thus, BDNF, in addition its role as a potent neuromodulator, emerges as an excitatory transmitter-like substance which acutely controls resting membrane potential, neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and participates in the induction of synaptic plasticity.

### Introduction

Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a protein that belongs to the family of neurotrophins that regulate the survival, growth and differentiation of neurons in the central nervous system. Other members of the neurotrophin family, characterized by their sequence homology, include nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5). All four genes encoding for these neurotrophins have been found in fish, amphibians, reptiles and mammals. The search for other sequence-related molecules has led to the identification of new neurotrophins in the bony fish and lamprey, whereas no neurotrophin homolog has been found in non-vertebrates. Neurotrophins are generated as pre-pro-neurotrophin precursors which are further processed until they are eventually secreted as mature homodimeric proteins into the extracellular space.

Originally, BDNF was purified from pig brain, based on its survival-promoting action on a subpopulation of dorsal root ganglion cells. Later on, it was demonstrated that BDNF and its receptors are also widely expressed in the central nervous system. A particularly high expression is found in areas of both developmental and adult synaptic plasticity such as the hippocampus and cerebral cortex. Another intriguing aspect of BDNF is that both its expression and its secretion are tightly regulated during development and by neuronal activity. Moreover, recent studies indicate that not only the mature protein, but also its precursor “proBDNF” is secreted in an activity-dependent manner. Despite experimental hints suggesting a constitutive release of BDNF, there is no clear evidence for a “true” constitutive release under physiological conditions at present. In contrast to BDNF, a clear correlation between neuronal activity and expression and secretion of NGF, NT-3 or NT-4/5 has not been established yet. Thus, BDNF emerges as a prime candidate for transmitting neuronal activity into morphological and functional remodeling and maintenance of neuronal circuits.

BDNF binds to two structurally unrelated plasma membrane receptor types, the p75 neurotrophin receptors and the tyrosine kinase receptors TrkB. Whereas TrkB receptors also bind NT-4/5 with a slightly lower affinity than BDNF, NGF and NT-3 preferentially activate the tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA and TrkC, respectively. The NT-induced tyrosine kinase activity of TrkB triggers intracellular signalling cascades, which can result in changes in cellular gene expression.

In addition to the classical neurotrophic effects of BDNF, which are evident within hours or days, a pioneering study by Lohof and coworkers showed that application of BDNF to

cultured neurons and muscle cells potentiates synaptic transmission at the developing neuromuscular junction within minutes by enhancing neurotransmitter release of from presynaptic terminals. (21) Subsequently, acute effects BDNF on synaptic transmission were reported from the central nervous system. It was shown that BDNF potentiates excitatory synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons, (22,23) and that it is involved in the induction of long-term potentiation, (6,13,24) a well-established cellular model for learning and memory. Many of the synaptic effects of BDNF could be accounted for by presynaptic modification of transmitter release. (22,25–28) In addition, rapid effects of BDNF on postsynaptic ion channels have been demonstrated. (24,25,29,30)

Ion channels are protein complexes in the plasma membrane that allow the regulated passage of ions and, therefore, mediate electrical and chemical signalling of neurons. The opening of ion channels is strictly regulated and their gating is triggered either by changes in membrane potential or by extracellular or intracellular ligands. In addition, activation of intracellular second messenger cascades and protein phosphorylation modify the properties of ion channels by influencing their open probability or conductance. Indeed, it was demonstrated by several laboratories that BDNF modulates ion channel properties by such mechanisms. Recently, a surprising new role of BDNF has emerged. Studies in our laboratory have revealed that BDNF not only acts as a modulator of ion channels that are otherwise gated by membrane voltage or ligands, but also can rapidly gate a Na⁺ channel, assigning BDNF the properties of a classical excitatory transmitter. (31,32) The aim of the present review is to present and discuss these findings that establish BDNF as a potent modulator and a direct mediator of postsynaptic ion channel conductance in the central nervous system. For a synopsis on the effects of BDNF on presynaptic function, the reader is referred to excellent earlier reviews. (25–28)

### TrkB receptor-mediated signalling

The cellular effects of BDNF are mediated through the receptor tyrosine kinase TrkB and/or the pan-neurotrophin receptor p75NTR. (14,15) Both receptors can act independently but also interact with each other. (16,17) In addition to BDNF, TrkB receptors bind NT-4/5 albeit with a slightly lower affinity. NT-4/5 can, therefore, induce similar effects as BDNF. (22,31,33) TrkB receptors are expressed in several splice variants. (17) Full-length receptors (TrkBFL) possess an intracellular tyrosine kinase domain and their enzymatic activity is considered to be critical for the effects of BDNF or NT-4/5. Truncated receptors (TrkB-T1; TrkB-T2), in contrast, lack tyrosine kinase activity. (14,18) Despite this lack of enzymatic activity, several studies suggest a role of truncated receptors in cellular signalling. Activation of TrkB-T1 and TrkB-T2 increased the release of acidic metabolites (34) and expression of TrkB-T1 induced outgrowth of filopodia and processes in neuroblastoma cells. (35) Moreover, TrkB-T1 receptors mediate rapid BDNF-induced activation of PLC and IP₃-induced calcium release from intracellular stores in glial cells. (33) The exact molecular mechanisms, by which cellular signalling through truncated TrkB receptors is achieved, are still unknown.

Binding of BDNF to TrkBFL dimers activates various intracellular signalling cascades. The first step after binding is the phosphorylation of several tyrosine residues in the cytoplasmic domain of each receptor. The autophosphorylation causes recruitment of a series of intracellular proteins and triggers signal transduction pathways (Fig. 1). (17,19,20,36) One is the phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) pathway, which results in the formation of the second messengers DAG and IP₃ and

![Figure 1](#fig1)

**Figure 1. Classical signal transduction pathways activated by binding of BDNF to TrkBFL.** The binding of a dimer of BDNF causes the dimerization and autophosphorylation of TrkBFL. Subsequently, three major signalling cascades are activated, which, at least partly, mediate the effects of BDNF on neuronal survival, axon growth, long-term potentiation and synaptic transmission. PLC, Phospholipase Cγ; IP₃, inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate; MAPK-1/2, mitogen-activated protein kinases 1 and 2; MEK, MAPK-kinase; PI-3-K, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase.

calcium release from intracellular stores. In primary cultures of embryonic rat brain cells, the stimulation of PLC-γ phosphorylation can occur within 20 seconds after addition of BDNF and lasts up to 30 minutes. (37) Interestingly, the amount of activation of PLC-γ seems to depend on the specific neurotrophin. BDNF stimulated much stronger interactions of PLC-γ with TrkBFL in TrkBFL-expressing PC12 cells than NGF and NT-3 in cultured cortical neurons, even though the three neurotrophins induced similar levels of tyrosine phosphorylation of Trk receptors. (38)

Trk-mediated activation of PLC-γ has been shown to be critical for hippocampal long-term potentiation (LTP) induced by a theta burst or tetanic stimulation (39) and to directly induce or modulate ion currents (see below). (40–43) In addition to PLC-γ activation, TrkBFL phosphorylation causes stimulation of the phospholipid kinase PI-3 kinase and the Akt-kinase, which are major survival-promoting proteins for neurons. Finally, the small GTP-binding protein Ras and the MEK-MAPK pathway are stimulated, which are involved in both promoting neuronal survival and axonal growth (Fig. 1). (17, 19, 20, 36)

Besides triggering these intracellular signalling pathways, which are responsible for the majority of modulatory effects of BDNF in the range of seconds to minutes, recent studies have demonstrated that TrkBFL activation by BDNF or NT-4/5 can rapidly mediate the gating of Na+ channels. (31, 32) The fast NT-evoked excitation occurs within about 10 milliseconds and is independent of the above described signalling cascades. The subsequent opening of voltage-gated calcium channels results in an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration, (44) and may cause activation of calcium-dependent signalling cascades (see below and Fig. 5).

### Modulation of postsynaptic ligand-gated ion channels by BDNF

BDNF exerts rapid effects on both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission by changing the properties of ionotropic receptors. A variety of studies have established that BDNF directly modulates postsynaptic glutamate-gated ion channels. In 1995, Levine et al. showed that bath application of BDNF increased the firing rate of cultured hippocampal neurons twofold within 2–3 minutes of application. (45) Moreover, the mean amplitude of evoked EPSCs increased by 60%. (45) This effect was omitted by injection of the tyrosine kinase blocker K-252a into the postsynaptic neuron, indicating an involvement of postsynaptic TrkBFL receptors. The activation of TrkBFL caused an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor subunit NR2B (46) that resulted in an increase in NMDA receptor open probability. (47) Subsequently it was shown that the Src-family tyrosine kinase Fyn is a key molecule linking TrkBFL with NMDA receptors. (48) The same study demonstrated that spatial learning induced phosphorylation of TrkBFL, Fyn and NR2B in the hippocampus, indicating an important role for the interaction between BDNF/TrkBFL signaling and NMDA receptors for spatial memory in the hippocampus.

An entirely different mechanism of action of neurotrophins on NMDA-receptor channels was reported by Jarvis et al. in cultured hippocampal and striatal neurons. (49) They observed an increase in NMDA receptor open probability following application of BDNF, NT-3, NT-4 or NGF that occurred within less than 1 second. Because the enhancement of NMDA currents was not blocked by K-252a, it was concluded that it was independent on tyrosine phosphorylation. Interestingly, the modulation of NMDA responses by BDNF was inversely dependent on the glycine concentration, indicating that neurotrophins might serve as glycine-like ligands for the NMDA receptor.

The acute effects of BDNF on AMPA-receptor mediated transmission are controversial. Whereas the aforesaid studies did not report an alteration in the properties of AMPA-receptor-mediated transmission, Song et al. found that BDNF, in addition to enhancing synaptic transmission through NMDA receptors, caused suppression of AMPA-receptor-mediated currents in cultured hippocampal neurons. (50) A subsequent study in dissociated brainstem neurons reported similar results. (51) There is evidence that the suppression of AMPA responses by BDNF was dependent on tyrosine kinase activity, suggesting the involvement of TrkBFL. In contrast, a study by Narisawa-Saito et al. showed that BDNF upregulates surface expression of AMPA receptors by inducing their rapid surface translocation, (52) pointing towards an increase in AMPA-receptor-mediated transmission by BDNF. In BDNF knockout mice, addition of BDNF together with electrical stimulation caused an upregulation of surface AMPA receptors, converting “silent” (NMDA-only-) synapses to AMPA-containing synapses. (53)

Besides modulating glutamatergic transmission, BDNF and activation of TrkBFL receptors, respectively, acutely affect GABAA-receptor-mediated responses. However, in contrast to the observed increase in NMDA receptor function in both developing and adult hippocampus, the effect of BDNF on GABAergic transmission changes dramatically during postnatal development in hippocampal neurons. These changes parallel the developmental switch of GABA from acting as an excitatory to an inhibitory transmitter. (54, 55) Early in development (around postnatal day 6) when GABA action is excitatory, BDNF potentiates postsynaptic GABAA-receptor-mediated responses. (43) This potentiation is caused by activation of TrkBFL and PLC-γ, and depends on an elevation of intracellular calcium. At postnatal day 14, when GABA is inhibitory, acute BDNF application reduces the amplitude of GABAergic currents within a few minutes. (40, 43, 56, 57) The long-lasting inhibition of GABAergic transmission is dependent on activation of TrkBFL and PLC-γ, and also on the elevation

of intracellular calcium. In between, around postnatal day 10, BDNF effects range from potentiating to inhibitory.^(43)^

The developmental shift of the actions of BDNF on inhibitory systems might be caused by changes in the intracellular signalling pathway of TrkB receptors. This was indicated by the study of Mizoguchi et al., who showed that calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 2 (CaMK-2) is necessary for the potentiation of GABA~A~-responses by BDNF, but not for their inhibition.^(43)^ Notably, GABA itself induces large calcium transients in neocortical neurons during the first postnatal week, but not beyond two weeks of postnatal development.^(58)^ In addition, a concomitant activation of other intracellular signalling pathways might influence the direction of modulation of GABAergic inhibitory synaptic transmission by BDNF. GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in Purkinje cells from rat cerebella at postnatal days 13–16 were enhanced by BDNF, when the BDNF application was coupled with activation of the non-receptor protein kinase Src or with pharmacological activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors.^(59)^

As proposed for ionotropic glutamate receptors, two basic mechanisms might contribute to the direct modulatory effect of BDNF on GABA~A~ receptors. First, GABA~A~-receptor-mediated currents might be modulated through direct changes of the channel conductance following increases in intracellular calcium. Alternatively, a rapid internalisation of GABA~A~ receptors could underlie the modulatory effect of BDNF.^(56,57)^ Recently, an indirect effect of BDNF on GABA-mediated currents was observed in GABAergic neurons. It was suggested that BDNF rapidly downregulates postsynaptic Cl^- transport in GABAergic neurons. The resulting positive shift in the reversal potential of GABAergic currents caused a reduction in the inhibitory action of IPSCs.^(60)^

### Modulation of potassium channels by tyrosine phosphorylation

Modulation of ion channels by protein kinases (and phosphatases) is a common mechanism by which the excitability of neurons is altered. It occurs for many classes of ion channels, including sodium, calcium and potassium channels.^(61–63)^ Several subtypes of potassium channels are subject to tyrosine phosphorylation after application of BDNF. This was demonstrated for K~v~1.3, a voltage-dependent potassium channel that determines the resting membrane potential of neurons and regulates their excitability. In cultured neurons from the olfactory bulb, acute BDNF-induced activation of TrkB^FL^ receptors increased tyrosine phosphorylation of K~v~1.3 within about 15 minutes.^(64)^ The tyrosine phosphorylation suppressed the whole-cell outward current, whereas no changes in the kinetics of inactivation or deactivation were observed. Interestingly, unilateral naris occlusion increased BDNF-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of K~v~1.3 in neurons lacking odour sensory experience. These results indicate that the sensory input to a neuron can influence the properties of a voltage-gated ion channel through alteration of its degree of phosphorylation through neurotrophins.

In addition to modulation of voltage-dependent potassium channels, BDNF alters the activity of G-protein-activated inward rectifying potassium channels (Kir3). Kir3 channels are widely expressed throughout the brain and mediate the actions of a wide range of pertussis toxin-sensitive, G-protein-coupled receptors. Treatment of oocytes expressing TrkB^FL^ and functional homomeric channels of either Kir3.1 or Kir3.4 with BDNF for 10–15 minutes produced tyrosine phosphorylation of the channels and a strong depression of the channel current.^(65)^ A subsequent study suggested that BDNF activation of TrkB^FL^ is likely to inhibit Kir3 by channel deactivation.^(66)^

#### Activation of currents through components of the PLC-γ signalling cascade

As mentioned above, binding of BDNF to TrkB^FL^ receptors activates PLC-γ, which leads to the production of DAG and IP~3~ and initiates release of calcium from intracellular stores (Fig. 1).^(67–69)^ PLC-dependent calcium elevations have been demonstrated to induce calcium-activated potassium currents. These currents are highly selective for potassium ions and require intracellular calcium for channel gating. They are expressed in most neuronal cells where they contribute to spike repolarisation and after-hyperpolarisation.^(70)^

It was shown in neurons from visual cortex that BDNF application for 1–2 minutes caused both a long-lasting increase in intracellular calcium and an outward current which was identified as calcium-activated potassium current.^(42)^ Pharmacological inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC) as well as chelation of intracellular calcium suppressed the BDNF-induced current, demonstrating its dependency on a PLC-induced calcium elevation. Activation of calcium-dependent potassium channels is, however, achieved not only by calcium elevations caused by BDNF and TrkB^FL^. Holm et al. demonstrated that NT-3 and NGF activate a sustained, calcium-dependent potassium current in cortical neurons.^(71)^ This current was blocked by inhibitors of PLC and omission of calcium from the extracellular medium. Because of its sensitivity to protein kinase inhibitors, the latter study also pointed to an involvement of TrkC and TrkA, high-affinity tyrosine kinase receptors for NT-3 and NGF, respectively.^(14,16,17)^

A BDNF-evoked, PLC-γ-dependent current was described in pontine neurons.^(41)^ A 30 second application of BDNF caused activation of a delayed (1 minute) non-selective cation conductance that lasted for about 30 minutes. This current was mainly carried by sodium ions and blocked by K-252a, indicating the involvement of TrkB^FL^. Furthermore the current was blocked by either a PLC inhibitor or an antagonist of IP~3~ receptors, demonstrating its dependence on the PLC-γ
signalling cascade. Based on a series of elegant experiments, it was concluded that the BDNF-evoked current was, at least partly, mediated by TRPC3 channels (see Fig. 5).<sup>(41)</sup> TRPC3 belong to the family of transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels that are non-voltage-gated, store-operated cation channels highly expressed in the brain. Furthermore, it was found that the temporal and spatial distribution of TRPC3 channels paralleled that of TrkB. Intriguingly, TRPC3 could be co-immunoprecipitated with TrkB in protein extracts from neonatal rat brain, suggesting that TrkB might bind, directly or indirectly, to this putative channel. These results suggested that neurotrophins might be directly coupled via TrkB receptors to non-selective cation influx pathways in central neurons (Fig. 5).

TRPC3 is not the only member of the TRP family that is coupled to a neurotrophin receptor. Recently, it was shown that the capsaicin receptor VR1 (TRPV1), a non-selective cation channel that is activated by heat and protons, directly interacts with TrkA and PLC-γ.<sup>(72)</sup> TrkA is a receptor tyrosine kinase that is activated by the neurotrophin NGF (nerve growth factor).<sup>(14)</sup> The interaction between TrkA, PLC-γ and TRPV1 results in an NGF-mediated potentiation of channel activity and is the basis for the sensitisation of nerve endings to noxious stimuli observed with NGF.

### Direct gating of Na<sup>+</sup> channels by TrkB<sup>FL</sup>

In addition to modulating or activating ion channels through intracellular signalling cascades within seconds to minutes,

NT-induced activation of TrkB<sup>FL</sup> can gate ion channels within milliseconds. This unexpected finding was first reported by Kafitz et al., who demonstrated that short puffs of BDNF or NT-4/5 cause membrane depolarisation of neurons from different brain regions within a few milliseconds.<sup>(31)</sup> Depending on the concentration and the length of the stimulus, the BDNF-induced depolarisation eventually resulted in the firing of action potentials (Fig. 2b). The extremely fast excitatory action of BDNF is comparable to neuronal excitation induced by the classical excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate, although much lower concentrations of BDNF (low nanomolar range) are required as compared to glutamate. This finding identified BDNF as the most potent excitatory substance in the central nervous system. The mechanism underlying the BDNF-induced excitation of neurons proved to be unusual and unexpected.<sup>(31)</sup>

Excitatory effects within the millisecond range were previously restricted to substances that bind to plasma membrane receptors that are also ion channels, such as the glutamate-gated NMDA or AMPA receptors. Upon binding of their ligand, these ionotropic receptors initiate the immediate opening of their intrinsic ion pore without requirement of additional (and time-consuming) intracellular signalling steps. The consecutive rapid ion fluxes across the plasma membrane are the basis for the fast signal transduction at chemical synapses. However, none of the neurotrophin receptors identified so far is a classical ionotropic receptor that includes an ion channel. Still, the study by Kafitz et al.<sup>(31)</sup> suggested that

BDNF caused the fast opening of Na<sup>+</sup> selective ion channels (Fig. 2c, d). Moreover, the BDNF effect was blocked by K252a, indicative of an involvement of TrkB<sup>FL</sup> receptors. The rapidity of the effect suggested that TrkB<sup>FL</sup> might interact either directly or indirectly through an adaptor molecule with the Na<sup>+</sup> selective channels and cause them to open without additional signalling steps (Fig. 3b). The blocking effect of K252a, which usually indicates involvement of tyrosine kinase activity, was attributed to steric hindrance, preventing TrkB<sup>FL</sup> from binding to either the Na<sup>+</sup> channel or to an adaptor of the response, or to a requirement of a basic level of already pre-phosphorylated TrkB<sup>FL</sup> receptors.<sup>(31)</sup>

The molecular mechanism underlying fast BDNF-evoked excitation of neurons was further elucidated by a recent study by Blum et al. (Fig. 3).<sup>(32)</sup> First, they established that BDNF induced a fast inward current in the neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY5Y and determined expression of different Na<sup>+</sup> channel isoforms in this system. Earlier experiments had shown that the BDNF-evoked excitation was blocked by low concentrations of the Na<sup>+</sup> channel blocker saxitoxin (STX), but required high concentrations of tetrodotoxin (TTX) for block.<sup>(73)</sup> Thus, the TTX-insensitive Na<sup>+</sup> channel Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 was identified as

a prime candidate for mediating the response to BDNF. Indeed, expression of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 antisense oligonucleotides abolished the expression of BDNF-induced currents in both SH-SY5Y and hippocampal neurons. Finally, the BDNF-evoked current was functionally reconstituted by co-expressing TrkB<sup>FL</sup> and Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 in HEK-cells (Fig. 3a). As in neurons and SH-SY5Y cells, the BDNF-evoked Na<sup>+</sup> current in reconstituted HEK cells was blocked by STX, but resistant to TTX. Expression of just Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 or TrkB<sup>FL</sup> failed to reconstitute the BDNF response (Fig. 3a), demonstrating that both components are sufficient and necessary constituents of the BDNF current. Moreover, this result indicated that, if at all, ubiquitously available cellular constituents may be additional elements of the BDNF-sensing receptor-channel complex.

Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 belongs to the family of voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels, which were previously thought to be exclusively gated by changes in membrane voltage.<sup>(74)</sup> Therefore, the gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 by TrkB<sup>FL</sup> was a new and surprising finding. Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 is especially known for its high expression in peripheral sensory neurons,<sup>(75)</sup> but it was also detected by in situ and northern blot hybridisation in virtually every region of the brain.<sup>(76)</sup> In peripheral sensory neurons, there is strong evidence that Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 mediates a slow, persistent, TTX-insensitive voltage-gated Na<sup>+</sup> current called NaN, which is involved in the control of resting potential and excitability.<sup>(75,77–79)</sup> Interestingly, Blum et al. reported that HEK-293 cells expressing only Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 did not show any current in response to depolarisation (Fig. 3a).<sup>(32)</sup> Opening of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels was only achieved through application of BDNF, when Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 channels were expressed together with TrkB.

How is gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 achieved? The sequence structure of this channel implies that it is likely to be gated by voltage. The channel carries all relevant protein motifs of voltage-gated sodium channels with four internally homologous domains (DI-DIV), each containing six putative α-helical transmembrane segments (S1-S6) and two pore-lining segments (SS1-SS2). The positively charged residues in the S4 domain, which are involved in voltage-sensing, as well as the inactivation gate IFM-residues (internal loop III-region), align perfectly with other voltage-gated sodium channel family members. In the absence of TrkB<sup>FL</sup> receptors, voltage-gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 may require the expression of additional subunits and/or regulatory factors, such as annexin II light chain.<sup>(80)</sup> The cell-specific expression of such factors in sensory neurons might enable its gating by voltage and be independent of TrkB<sup>FL</sup>. In central neurons, on the contrary, the lack of these factors might render voltage-gating of Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 dependent on TrkB<sup>FL</sup> function. Indeed, in the presence of BDNF (and TrkB<sup>FL</sup>), the current mediated by Na<sub>v</sub>1.9 in central neurons behaved like a voltage-dependent channel: it gradually decreased at membrane potentials below –65 mV and disappeared at –100 mV.<sup>(32)</sup> The reason for this rectification is

not clear and it was speculated that the receptor-mediated activation requires “voltage-priming” of the Naᵥ1.9 channel.

Due to the rapidity of TrkB-mediated opening of Naᵥ1.9, a very close association of channel and neurotrophin receptor is likely (Fig. 3b). Naᵥ1.9 shows no obvious protein domains in comparison to other sodium channels, which suggests that the site of interaction is TrkB. The gating mechanism of Naᵥ1.9 in central neurons is unprecedented and the search for the molecular elements that mediate its interaction with TrkBFL and its subsequent gating represents a challenging task for the next couple of years. (81,82) Of equal importance will be a thorough electrophysiological analysis of the current. The BDNF-evoked current probably desensitises rapidly, because BDNF must be applied quickly to detect the effect. (31) This desensitisation may be caused by an intrinsic inactivation mechanism of the channels or reflect their fast internalisation. Furthermore, it needs to be established, whether gating by a membrane-spanning receptor is restricted to Naᵥ1.9 or whether other Na⁺ channel isoforms are gated in a similar manner.

### Functional roles of BDNF-mediated gating of Na⁺ channels

The demonstrated interaction of TrkB and Naᵥ1.9 sheds new light on the role of neurotrophins in synaptic plasticity. It was demonstrated by several groups that BDNF plays a role in LTP induction. (1,2,13,83) A study by Kovalchuk and coworkers (44) identified dendritic spines as the primary sites of BDNF-evoked excitation in central neurons (Fig. 4). It demonstrated that BDNF increases the level of postsynaptic calcium by activating voltage-gated calcium channels through membrane depolarisation. Pairing weak afferent stimuli with brief BDNF pulses, applied specifically to the active synaptic input, evoked LTP in hippocampal dentate granule or in CA1 pyramidal cells (Fig. 4a). This LTP occluded with the conventional, tetanic stimulation-evoked LTP, indicating that the BDNF-evoked Na⁺ current is not responsible for a new form of LTP, but rather represents a powerful means of rapid amplification of the induction process in an input-specific manner. Thus, the discovery of the constituents of BDNF-evoked Na⁺ current provides a molecular basis for the proposed immediate and instructive role of the BDNF–TrkB system for LTP (Fig. 4b).

Another role of BDNF-evoked excitation was highlighted by a recent study investigating the mechanisms of neurite extension. It was found that BDNF-evoked neurite outgrowth in cultured hippocampal neurons was blocked with high affinity by STX, but not by TTX. (73) Instead, BDNF-independent neurite outgrowth was insensitive to STX, demonstrating that STX-sensitive Na⁺ channels are required for BDNF-induced neurite outgrowth. Thus, BDNF itself evoked both a powerful neuronal excitation and neurite extension, suggesting a new mode of activity-dependent control of neurite outgrowth, coming into play—as far as known—predominantly in the central nervous system.

Fig. 1), BDNF causes the direct opening of the Na+ channel Nav1.9 through an as-yet-unknown coupling mechanism. In addition, the activation of PLC mediates opening of TRPC3 channels. Both pathways result in the influx of Na+ and of Ca2+, which is involved in the modulation of synaptic transmission and in the induction of long-term potentiation.

signals are likely to lead to the activation of different CaM-CaM-kinase transduction pathways and CREB and, therefore, induce activity-dependent gene expression and neuronal plasticity. (84,85) In addition, molecules like the Ras-guanine-nucleotide-releasing factors (Ras-GRF), which are calcium-regulated Ras GDP/GTP exchange factors, (86) might act as integration molecules for spatiotemporal coordination of rapid neurotrophin-evoked calcium signals to the Ras-MAPK pathway (87) or even to the Ras-PI3-kinase pathway. Thus, rapid neurotrophin-evoked neuronal activity, which occurs within milliseconds, might regulate neurotrophin-evoked intracellular signalling cascades that occur on the time scale of seconds to minutes.

### Conclusions

In the last couple of years, knowledge about the cellular actions of neurotrophins, like BDNF in the central nervous system has, accumulated at a rapid rate. The new results on the rapid action of BDNF and NT-4/5 produced a marked change in our perspective of how neurotrophins work. It is now well established that activation of TrkBFL by BDNF triggers intracellular signalling cascades that effectively modulate ligand-gated, voltage-gated, and second-messenger-gated ion currents within seconds to minutes (Fig. 5). Moreover, activation of TrkBFL directly gates sodium channels within milliseconds (Fig. 5). Thus, BDNF emerges not only as a potent neuromodulator but also as a substance with fast excitatory action on neurons, which acutely controls resting membrane potential, neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and participates in the induction of synaptic and morphological plasticity (Fig. 5). Still, numerous questions remain. The cellular mechanisms and signalling cascades that cause modulation of the diverse ion channels by BDNF are largely unclear. Furthermore, exploration of the molecular mechanism of sodium channel gating by TrkBFL might reveal yet unknown modes of ion channel activation. Other unresolved questions that are directly linked to our understanding of BDNF action on ion channels, concern the subcellular location and the temporal profile of constitutive and activity-induced release of BDNF. The elucidation of these challenging questions will add exciting new insights to our understanding of the role of neurotrophins in brain function.
