Peptidoglycan (PG) is the major structural polymer of the bacterial cell wall. The PG layer of gram-positive bacterial pathogens such as *Staphylococcus aureus* (*S. aureus*) is permeated with anionic glycopolymers known as wall teichoic acids (WTAs) and lipoteichoic acids (LTAs). In *S. aureus*, the WTA backbone typically consists of repeating ribitol-5-phosphate units, which are modified by enzymes that introduce glycosylation as well as amino acids at different locations. These modifications are key determinants of phage adhesion, bacterial biofilm formation and virulence of *S. aureus*. In this review, we examine differences in WTA structures in gram-positive bacteria, focusing in particular on three enzymes, TarM, TarS, and TarP that glycosylate the WTA of *S. aureus* at different locations. Infections with *S. aureus* pose an increasing threat to human health, particularly through the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. Recently obtained structural information on TarM, TarS and TarP has helped to better understand the strategies used by *S. aureus* to establish resistance and to evade host defense mechanisms. Moreover, structures of complexes with poly-RboP and its analogs can serve as a platform for the development of new inhibitors that could form a basis for the development of antibiotic agents.

polysaccharide (CP) [1]. WTAs constitute the most abundant component of the *S. aureus* cell envelope, serving essential functions in cell wall integrity, susceptibility to bacteriophages, resistance to antimicrobial molecules, bacterial biofilm formation and host interaction [2–5]. To date, the best-characterized WTA structures are composed of repeating units of either glycerol-3-phosphate (GroP) or ribitol-5-phosphate (RboP) [6–8]. Most *S. aureus* variants synthesize RboP-WTA. The GroP or RboP backbone is covalently attached to the PG via a conserved linkage unit (Figure 1a). This unit includes one (for *B. subtilis*) or two (for *S. aureus*) GroP units followed by a disaccharide (*N*-acetylmannosamine (ManNAc) and *N*-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate (GlcNAc-1P)) linked to the C6 hydroxyl of *N*-acetylmuramic acid (MurNAc) via a phosphodiester bond [9–11]. The names for the enzymes that synthesize GroP-WTA and RboP-WTA contain the prefix Tag (teichoic acid glycerol) or Tar (teichoic acid ribitol) and these enzymes are encoded by the respective *tag/tar* genes [12]. With respect to the RboP-WTA in *S. aureus*, TarA, B, D and O are primarily responsible for the synthesis of the conserved linkage unit, and TarF adds one additional GroP unit to complete this process [4,13–16].

The poly-RboP backbone of *S. aureus* typically consists of up to 40 RboP repeating units, which are synthesized by TarI, TarJ and polymerized by TarL (Figure 1a) [10,17]. Final modifications of specific hydroxyl groups in these RboP units are introduced after the backbone is fully assembled [18,19**]. Three such functionalizations are known: attachment of GlcNAc in the α (α-O-GlcNAcylation) or β (β-O-GlcNAcylation) configuration, and the attachment of alanine (D-alanylation). These functionalizations are performed by several distinct sets of enzymes [20,21].

D-alanylation at C2 position occurs after the GlcNAcylated WTA is translocated to the cell surface, and is catalyzed by four enzymes (DltA, DltB, DltC and DltD) encoded by the *dltABCD* operon (Figure 1b). By attaching cationic D-alanine esters to the WTA backbone, the overall surface charge of the bacterial cell wall matrix can be modulated, which constitutes one important resistance mechanism against cationic antimicrobial peptides and glycopeptide antibiotics such as vancomycin and teicoplanin [22–29].

The attachment of glycans to WTA, which will be our main focus in this review, serves a more complex function. We examine and compare recently solved structures of three

Synthesis and functionalization of the RboP-WTA in *S. aureus*. (a) Synthesis of the RboP-WTA polymer. The conserved linkage unit is synthesized by enzymes TarA, TarB, TarD, TarF and TarO. The RboP-WTA backbone is synthesized by Tarl, TarJ and polymerized by TarL. $R_{1}$, D-Ala or H; $R_{2}$, $\beta$-1,3-GlcNAc or H; $R_{3}$, $\alpha$- or $\beta$-1,4-GlcNAc or H.

TarP catalyzes the attachment of GlcNAc in the $\beta$ configuration at C3 hydroxyl of RboP-WTA. D-alanylation at C2 position is catalyzed by the respective DltA-D enzymes. Abbreviations: GlcNAc, $N$-acetylglucosamine; ManNAc, $N$-acetylmannosamine; MurNAc, $N$-acetylmuramic acid.

WTA glycosyltransferases in *S. aureus*. All three enzymes use identical donor (UDP-GlcNAc) and acceptor (RboP-WTA) substrates but generate slightly different products, and these small differences have dramatic consequences for pathogen-host interactions. The available structural data suggest general strategies for interactions of WTA-processing enzymes with the repetitive WTA backbone, and these could serve as a framework for predicting such binding sites in related enzymes as well as the development of WTA-based inhibitors.

TarM catalyzes $\alpha$-O-GlcNAcylation of RboP-WTA backbone at the C4 position

TarM was the first enzyme found to catalyze the glycosylation of RboP-WTA in *S. aureus*. However, TarM is only present in about 35% of *S. aureus* isolates, always appearing together with TarS [30**]. It has been suggested that TarM is an ancestral glycosyltransferase (GT) that has been lost in certain strains and lineages, such as in many human-associated *S. aureus*, during evolution [31]. TarM attaches GlcNAc to the C4 position of the RboP units in an $\alpha$ configuration utilizing uridine diphosphate $N$-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc) as its donor substrate (Figure 1b) [32]. The presence of C4-linked $\alpha$-O-GlcNAc on the cell surface of *S. aureus* enables serogroup B phages adsorption and infection, such as phage 80, 52A and 11, thus facilitating horizontal gene transfer that allows *S. aureus* to acquire and spread new virulence and resistance factors [33,34]. In contrast, podophages, such as $\Phi$44AHJD, $\Phi$66 and $\Phi$P68, are not able to

infect *S. aureus* harboring *tarM*, indicating that the glycosylation introduced by TarM protects *S. aureus* from the lytic activity of podophages [31]. Of note, the C4-α-O-GlcNAc on WTA is a pivotal requirement for WTA-dependent attachment of methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* (MRSA) to human nasal epithelial cells, enabling nasal colonization and infection [35].

### TarS catalyzes β-O-GlcNAcylation of RboP-WTA backbone at the C4 position

The related TarS glycosyltransferase is highly conserved in *S. aureus* genomes and known as a housekeeping WTA glycosyltransferase [30**]. TarS attaches GlcNAc residues to the C4 hydroxyl of RboP via a β-O-linkage [36], and thus modifies the poly-RboP backbone of WTA at the same position as TarM, using the same substrates (UDP-GlcNAc and RboP-WTA), but with a different linkage (Figure 1b). Like C4-α-O-GlcNAc, the C4-β-O-GlcNAcylated RboP-WTA on the *S. aureus* cell surface enables serogroup B phage adsorption [36], and possesses similar capacities to mediate the attachment of *S. aureus* to human nasal epithelial cells [35]. However, TarS-mediated C4-β-O-GlcNAcylation is required for *S. aureus* susceptibility to podophages, indicating that TarS cannot protect *S. aureus* against the lytic activity of podophages [31]. A significant discovery was that C4-β-O-GlcNAc of WTA can confer resistance to methicillin onto *S. aureus*, resulting in methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* [36]. Of particular relevance, the glycan moiety of WTA is targeted by about 70% of all *S. aureus*-reactive IgG antibodies [30**,37], and anti-C4-β-O-GlcNAcylated-WTA IgG levels are approximately tenfold higher compared with anti-C4-α-O-GlcNAcylated-WTA IgG in serum, indicating that C4-β-O-GlcNAc of RboP-WTA functions as an essential epitope for human anti-*S. aureus* antibodies [38**]. In addition, the C4-β-O-GlcNAc group of WTA is a pivotal factor for the induction of anti-WTA IgG-mediated C3 deposition and subsequent opsonophagocytosis [39].

### TarP catalyzes β-O-GlcNAcylation of RboP-WTA backbone at the C3 position

Recently, TarP has been identified as a glycosyltransferase from German healthcare-associated MRSA (HA-MRSA) CC5 strain N315. Three *S. aureus* prophages that encode *tarP* have been found in 70–80% of HA-MRSA clones CC5 and in 40% of livestock-associated MRSA (LA-MRSA) clones CC398. Interestingly, all *tarP*-harboring *S. aureus* genomes also contain *tarS*. Like TarS, TarP catalyzes the attachment of GlcNAc to the poly-RboP backbone via a β-O-linkage. However, a critical difference between the two enzymes is their specificity, with TarP modifying the C3 rather than the C4 hydroxyl group of RboP (Figure 1b) [40**]. Like C4-α-O-GlcNAc and C4-β-O-GlcNAc, *S. aureus* bearing C3-β-O-GlcNAc-WTA is susceptible to serogroup B phages, although to a lower extent compared to the C4-β-O-GlcNAc-WTA modification introduced by TarS. Notably, the *tarP*-expressing *S. aureus* strain N315 is resistant to podophage infection, similar to the strains expressing *tarM*. When *tarP* is expressed in a WTA glycosylation-deficient mutant of community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) strain MW2 (CC1), it can restore full oxacillin resistance, indicating that TarP-mediated C3-β-O-GlcNAcylation of WTA, similar to the TarS-mediated C4-β-O-GlcNAcylation, is able to confer *S. aureus* with resistance to β-lactams. Of particular significance, mice immunized with TarS-modified WTA cannot be protected from infection with *tarP*-expressing MRSA, indicating that TarP allows *S. aureus* to evade host defenses. Similarly, *tarP* expression reduces deposition of IgG from human serum on N315 cells, reduces neutrophil phagocytosis of N315 strains and abolishes IgG response of mice towards WTA [40**]. While it is still unknown how *tarP* renders *S. aureus* able to subvert antibody recognition by attenuating immunogenicity of WTAs, the assembled data on TarP suggest that this enzyme constitutes a new and crucial component of the *S. aureus* virulence factor arsenal.

#### Comparison of the overall structures of TarM, TarS and TarP

The glycosyltransferases TarM, TarS and TarP all form stable homotrimers displaying a propeller-like structure (Figure 2a–c), with a central hub mediating trimerization and three protruding blades harboring the catalytic domains [40**,41,42]. However, the similarities end there, as the sizes and shapes of the propeller-like structures as well as the overall organizations of the domains are quite different. TarM exhibits a canonical GT-B fold comprising two Rossmann-like domains (Figure 2e) and belongs to the glycosyltransferase family GT4, while TarS and TarP possess a GT-A fold with two Rossmann-like domains forming a central β-sheet (Figure 2d), thus belonging to the GT2 family of glycosyltransferases [40**,43–45].

Moreover, the three enzymes are also using different strategies for trimerization. The TarM trimerization domain is inserted in the N-terminus of the GT domain. In contrast, the trimerization domains of TarS and TarP are located at their C-termini [40**,41,42,46]. The structural motifs that mediate trimer formation are also different. TarP utilizes four α-helices organized in two bundles crossing each other with an angle of almost 90 degrees for trimerization, whereas TarS and TarM accomplish trimer assembly almost exclusively via β-sheets. A closer comparison of the TarP and TarS structures reveals that a copy of the C-terminal trimerization domain (CTD) of TarP is also present in TarS but does not mediate trimerization there, suggesting that this domain might serve another function, for example in providing a scaffold for the acceptor substrate [46].

### Reaction mechanisms of TarM, TarS and TarP

So far, no structure of TarS bound to an acceptor molecule (or an analog) is available. However, the GT domain of TarS shows 53% sequence similarity to TarP, with key amino acids in the UDP-GlcNAc binding site either identical or conserved. The essential amino acids and the corresponding tandem main chain amide groups (see below) for poly-RboP binding are also conserved. Therefore, the general catalytic mechanism of TarS is likely similar to that of TarP [40**].

TarS and TarP are both metal-ion dependent enzymes, featuring a DXD motif (Asp91, Asp93 in TarS, and Asp92, Asp94 in TarP). Both TarS and TarP contain either a Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺ cation in their active sites, and this ion is coordinated by the carboxylate groups of the DXD motif and by the diphosphate leaving group of UDP-GlcNAc [40**,41]. The structural data and mutagenesis analyses of TarS and TarP support a Sₙ2-like direct displacement mechanism through an oxocarbenium ion-like transition state, with the assistance of a base. The base catalyst residue Asp178 (TarS) or Asp181 (TarP) initiates the reaction by activating the hydroxyl in C4 (TarS) or C3 (TarP) of RboP and the activated nucleophile attacks the anomeric C1 of the GlcNAc moiety in the UDP-GlcNAc on the β-face. As observed with other inverting GT-A enzymes [44], the departure of the phosphate is then facilitated by Mg²⁺ or Mn²⁺, which stabilize the negative charge of the leaving group, yielding a β-O-GlcNAcylated poly-RboP product (Figure 3a,d).

In the Sₙ2-like direct displacement mechanism, two key questions that need to be addressed are the identification of the general base catalyst and the strategy used for facilitating departure of the leaving group. In the ternary TarP complex structure [40**], a structural motif composed of β6, α5, α6, β7a and β7b in the poly-RboP binding domain harbors the base catalyst, Asp181, which is located at the N-terminal end of helix α6. Interestingly, such a structural motif was also found in TarS as well as five other GT-A fold inverting enzyme structures (Figure 4a), suggesting that the base catalyst motif is

structurally conserved, and this motif could ensure the base catalyst to occupy a position equivalent to Asp178 (in TarS) or Asp181 (in TarP) within the active site (Figure 3a,d) to activate the corresponding nucleophile [47–50].

TarM is a retaining enzyme with a GT-B fold. In the structure of the TarMG117R mutant bound to fondaparinux, α-GlcNAc-glycerol and UDP, five sulfate groups of fondaparinux interact with the enzyme, and two of them superimpose with the ordered sulfate ions in the homotrimeric, unliganded TarM structure [46]. One of these two sulfate ions contacts four main chain amide groups (Gly16, Gly17, Met18, Thr19) and is within hydrogen bonding distance to Arg326, which forms salt bridges with

the β-phosphate of UDP-GlcNAc (Figure 3b,e). On the basis of its proximity to the active site, we propose that this site (N) may be the binding site for the phosphate group of a RboP unit in the active site. The second ordered sulfate ion (N-1) binds to a main chain tandem amide group (Gly229, Ser230). The distance between the N and N-1 sites is 11.5 Å, and N-1 may therefore define another phosphate binding site of a second RboP unit (see below). The location and orientation of N and N-1 suggests that TarM binds poly-RboP in such a way that the reactive ribitol moiety is placed next to the α-face of GlcNAc (Figure 3c). Moreover, the β-phosphate O1B atom of the leaving UDP is close to the oxygen of α-O-GlcNAc-glycerol. Taken together, these observations support an internal nucleophilic substitution (S_Ni)-like

mechanism operating through a stepwise or concerted process. In this mechanism, the leaving phosphate group itself would serve as the base catalyst, activating the C4-hydroxyl in the RboP unit. The activated nucleophile could then attack the anomeric C1 of GlcNAc on the α-face, leading to retained stereochemistry. The leaving group phosphate could be stabilized by residues Lys331 and Arg326, (Figure 3b,e) [42,46].

### Prediction of specific binding modes for RboP-WTA

The UDP-GlcNAc binding sites in TarS and TarP are similar, and the general architecture of the sites is also conserved in other GT-A fold inverting enzymes [47–49]. The donor substrate binding site in TarM is also similar to other GT-B fold retaining enzymes [51,52]. For poly-RboP, the structure of TarP in complex with tri-RboP provided the first (and so far only) insights into the determinants of specificity for the acceptor substrate. The tri-RboP docks into a curved groove on the TarP

surface, and key contacts serve to anchor the RboP phosphate groups of the polymeric substrate into the groove. The first phosphate group of tri-RboP is fixed by interactions with Tyr152, Lys255, Arg262 and Thr302 (position N-2) [40**]. The second phosphate group (N-1) interacts with TarP through tandem main chain amide groups (Lys132 and Ala133), and the third phosphate (position N) interacts with another set of tandem backbone amide groups (Leu154 and Ser155) as well as with Arg259 (Figure 4b) [40**]. Thus, tandem amide groups appear to facilitate the binding of phosphate groups in tri-RboP. A search of the surface of TarP identifies three additional such tandem main chain amide groups that could be potential binding sites for additional phosphate moieties in the longer poly-RboP substrate, at positions N + 2 (Lys266 and Lys267), N + 3 (Lys273 and Met274) and N-3 (Gln303 and Ile304, Figure 4c). The distances between two tandem groups are comparable to the distances between the phosphate groups of tri-RboP in the ternary TarP structure. In agreement with this, the TarS₁-

349 structure bound to UDP-GlcNAc contains a trapped sulfate ion whose position corresponds to second phosphate position of tri-RboP in TarP. Additionally, the N and N-1 sites composed of one or two tandem backbone amide groups in TarM-fondaparinux-α-GlcNAc-glycerol-UDP structure also bind sulfate (Figure 3c). For ribitol binding, two C–H-bonds of the first and second ribitol moieties interact with two aromatic π-systems (Tyr152 and His263) in the TarP-tri-RboP structure (Figure 4b) and such aromatic residues are conserved in TarS (Tyr149 and Phe256). These observations suggest that the CH/π interaction may be specific for the ribitol moiety binding of RboP-WTA. We therefore think it is likely that these two specific binding modes for phosphate and ribitol moieties observed in TarP could be conserved in other enzymes that use RboP-WTA as their substrate.

### Concluding remarks

Structural and functional researches of the glycosyltransferases in *S. aureus* have seen significant advances in recent years. A key discovery was the identification of TarP and its influence on the immune evasion abilities of *S. aureus*. The high resolution structures of TarP can thus serve as a platform for the development of new inhibitors that might help to render MRSA susceptible to human defenses and β-lactams [40**]. Because of structural conservation in the acceptor binding site, the TarP structure moreover allows for modelling poly-RboP-binding to TarS [40**]. How poly-RboP binds to TarM remains an unsolved question. TarM functions similarly to TarP in several aspects. However, TarM-glycosylated WTA is much less immunogenic than its TarP-glycosylated counterpart, thus, *S. aureus* expressing *tarM* may possess an even stronger capacity to evade host defense than those expressing *tarP* [38**]. In contrast, TarS, as the standard enzyme, could be favorable for *S. aureus* survival during infection and colonization [19**,35].

In the binary and ternary TarP structures, synthesized tri-RboP and six-RboP with a linker are used to explore the binding site for RboP-WTA [40**]. This study demonstrates that synthetic WTA fragments offer a solution for the challenge of studying WTA due to its microheterogeneity in length and structure [53]. Synthetic WTA fragments have wide applications, for instance as WTA epitope, to identify recognition principle of antibodies [38**,54**], as probes to discover new interaction partners, and as a platform for structure-function studies. It is predictable that synthetic WTA fragments will be useful tools in the future to unravel the mode of interactions between WTA and biomolecules at the molecular level.

By virtue of their accessibility and abundance, WTAs are key targets for developing anti-*S. aureus* therapeutic strategies, including antibody-based therapy, phage therapy, protective vaccines and new antibiotic agents. The molecular structures of *S. aureus* WTA define how

*S. aureus* interacts with the human host as well as with bacteriophages. However, insights into how WTA interacts with staphylococcal (or any other bacterial) enzymes remain limited, in part due to the complex chemical structure of WTA. Recent examples include structures of enzymes that synthesize WTA [55*], or of enzymes that link WTA to PG [56*]. Several recent structure-function studies have furthermore examined the binding of WTA components to bacterial enzymes or human *S. aureus*-targeting antibodies [54**,57]. None of the cited structures contain a multi-repeat WTA backbone ligand, and so detailed information on the parameters that underlie WTA binding and reactivity remains limited. A recent cryo-electron microscopy analysis of an ABC Transporter that translocates WTA identifies a channel for WTA, but no detailed contacts with the substrate [58**]. Thus, the ternary complex structure of TarP with the tri-RboP and UDP-GlcNAc substrates provides the first detailed view of interactions with a short WTA-based polymer, hinting at the underlying specificity for the binding of larger WTA chains. In combination with a better understanding of the regulation of WTA glycosylation in *S. aureus*, this knowledge forms a solid basis for strategies to combat MRSA in the future.
