genetically validated as a drug target [19–22], the enzyme(s) involved in biosynthesis may also represent attractive targets for novel chemotherapeutic intervention.

In the insect parasite *Crithidia fasciculata*, trypanothione is synthesised in an ATP-dependent manner from spermidine and GSH via the intermediate glutathionylspermidine (GspdSH) by two
standards (Bio-Rad). Molecular mass was determined by MALDI-TOF in linear mode using sinapinic acid as a matrix on a Voyager-DE STR mass spectrometer (PerSeptive Biosystems). After SDS–PAGE and transfer onto a PVDF membrane, the N-terminal sequence was determined by pulsed-liquid Edman sequencing on a Procise 494 protein sequencer (Applied Biosystems

Even though trypanosomatids share a common evolutionary ancestor [37], a single trypanothione biosynthetic enzyme in *T. brucei* and *T. cruzi* appears to be evolutionary divergent from *C. fascicul
