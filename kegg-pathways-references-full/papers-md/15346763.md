Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 is a camphor-degrading Gram-positive organism originally isolated from activated sewage sludge. A 5.4 kbp portion of a proposed camphor degradation gene cluster from this organism was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Four open reading frames (ORFs) were identified encoding proteins possibly involved in camphor metabolism; sequence alignment of the translation products suggested that the ORFs encode for a ferredoxin reductase, acyl-CoA ligase, epimerase and an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The last three activities are thought to be involved in the poorly understood late stage of camphor degradation. Our findings are entirely consistent with the proposed formation of a branched 9-carbon acid intermediate (3,4,4-trimethyl-5-oxo-trans-2-hexenoic acid) which has been isolated from the fermentation broth of camphor-grown cells.

**INTRODUCTION**

Rhodococcus is a taxon of genetically poorly characterised soil bacteria with the ability to transform a wide range of both natural and xenobiotic compounds (Finnerty, 1992). As such this group of microorganisms play an important role in bioremediation. The degradation of the bicyclic monoterpene camphor by Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 (previously classified as Corynebacterium sp. T1) was originally studied by Gunsalus and co-workers (Chapman et al., 1966). The pathway is distinct from that found in Pseudomonas putida (ATCC 17453, NCIMB 10007) which has been the subject of intense research (Bradshaw et al., 1959; Ougham et al., 1983; Jones et al., 1993). Recently there has been renewed interest in the camphor degradation pathway, not only in terms of understanding bacterial metabolism but also with a view to exploiting the enzyme activities in synthetic organic chemistry (Gagnon et al., 1994; Grogan et al., 2001a).

Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 is able to utilise (1R)-(+) -camphor as a sole carbon source (see Fig. 1). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of crude cell extracts from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 grown in one instance on sodium pyruvate, and in the other on (1R)-(+) -camphor as sole carbon source, indicate that the level of at least four proteins are markedly up-regulated in the presence of camphor (Grogan et al., 2002). One of these proteins, 6-oxo camphor hydrolase which catalyses the desymmetrisation of 6-oxo camphor to yield (2R,4S)-α-campholic acid, has been purified from Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 (Grogan et al., 2001b). Amino acid sequence data derived from the N-terminus allowed the cloning of the corresponding gene (camK).

CAMPHOR-DEGRADING GENE CLUSTER

phosphatase were from New England Biolabs (Beverly, USA). [γ-³²P]ATP (3000 Ci/mmol) and DNA size markers were purchased from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech (Uppsala, Sweden).

Standard DNA Manipulations, Cloning Procedure, and Gene Probes

Standard DNA procedures were used throughout (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). Total DNA was prepared from *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784 as described previously (Grogan *et al.*, 2001b). An oligonucleotide probe (5'-GTTCTTCTGGACCGAG-CAGCACGG-3') was designed to the 5'-region of a 2.0 kbp *SmaI* clone which encodes a portion of *camK* encoding 6-oxo camphor hydrolase (Grogan *et al.*, 2001b). The oligonucleotide was radiolabeled by a kinase reaction under standard conditions (Sambrook and Russell, 2001) and purified using a NICK column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). An aliquot of genomic DNA from *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784 was digested to completion with a range of different restriction endonucleases (*Eco RI*, *Pst I*, and *Kpn I*), and the digests were resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Following denaturation with alkali the DNA was blotted onto Hybond N membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) using a standard protocol (Sambrook and Russell, 2001), and fixed using a UV-cross-linker (Stratagene). The blot was probed with the radiolabeled oligonucleotide at 56°C for 48 h. The blot was then washed twice at room temperature with 300 mM NaCl, 30 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at room temperature for 15 min, and then 60 mM NaCl, 6 mM sodium citrate, 0.1% (w/v) SDS at 55°C for 15 min. Following autoradiography, a single cross-reacting band was visible in each lane. The lane corresponding to the *Eco RI* digest gave a band of approximately 5.5 kbp. A digest of *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784 genomic DNA with *Eco RI* was repeated at preparative scale and resolved by agarose gel electrophoresis. Fragments of DNA corresponding to 5.0–6.0 kbp were gel eluted and shotgun cloned into pUC18. The DNA was transformed into *E. coli* XL1 Blue and positive clones subsequently isolated by a colony lift procedure. Putative positive clones were analysed by a dot blot procedure, using the same probe and hybridisation conditions as described earlier, prior to sequencing.

Nucleotide Sequence Determination and Sequence Analysis

Double stranded DNA sequencing (Sanger *et al.*, 1977) was performed throughout, and the reactions were resolved on an automated DNA sequencer (ABI PRISM 377; Perkin-Elmer Life Sciences).

FIGURE 1 The proposed degradation pathway of (1R)-(+-)-camphor in *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784. Structures shown are: 1, (1R)-(+-)-camphor; 2, 6-endo hydroxycamphor; 3, 6-oxo camphor; 4, (2R,4S)-α-campholic acid; 5, isohydroxy camphorolactone; 6, isohydroxy camphoric acid; 7, isoketo camphoric acid; 8, CoASH ester of isoketo camphoric acid; 9, 3,4,4-trimethyl-5-oxo-trans-2-hexenoic acid. Enzyme activity: a, cytochrome P450; b, dehydrogenase; c, 6-oxo camphor hydrolase; d, Baeyer-Villiger oxidation; e, esterase; f, dehydrogenase; g, acyl-CoA ligase; h, acyl CoA dehydrogenase/decarboxylase.

Analysis of ORFs close to *camK* indicate that their translation products are likely to be involved in the degradation pathway of camphor in this organism. Therefore at least some of the genes encoding enzymes involved in (1R)-(+-)-camphor metabolism appear to be clustered. In this paper we describe the cloning and analysis of a 5.4 kbp *Eco RI* fragment that lies just upstream of the *camK* gene.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Bacterial Strains, Plasmids, Chemicals, Media, and Culture Conditions

*Escherichia coli* XL1 Blue supercompetent cells were obtained from Stratagene (La Jolla, USA) and grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). Ampicillin was used at 100 μg/ml when required for selection of plasmid. *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784 was obtained from the National Culture of Industrial and Marine Bacteria (Aberdeen, United Kingdom). The strain was maintained on nutrient agar slopes at room temperature, grown in LB medium at 30°C. pUC18 (Vieira and Messing, 1982), and was used as a general cloning vector. All chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, United Kingdom). Restriction endonucleases, T4 DNA ligase, T4 polynucleotide kinase and calf intestinal alkaline

All sequencing was carried out on both strands. Contiguous nucleotide sequence was obtained by a primer-hopping strategy using synthetic oligonucleotide primers. Nucleotide sequence data were assembled using the MacVector and DNAstrider software packages. Database homology searches (SWISSPROT release 41 protein database) were carried out using the BLASTP (Altschul *et al.*, 1997) program. Multiple sequence alignments were generated with ClustalW, version 1.7 (Thompson *et al.*, 1994), using the default parameters. The PUSTELL program from the MacVector package was used for the pairwise graphical representation of polypeptide sequence identity.

Nucleotide Sequence Accession Number

The nucleotide sequence reported in this study has been deposited in the GenBank under the Accession No. AF323755.

RESULTS

Cloning DNA Downstream of *camK*

The gene encoding 6-oxo camphor hydrolase (*camK*) had been previously cloned from *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784 by designing a degenerate set of primers to the N-terminal sequence obtained from the purified enzyme (Grogan *et al.*, 2001b). Three separate partially overlapping fragments, covering 6.2 kbp of DNA were cloned (Fig. 2). In this study, an oligonucleotide probe was designed to the 5'-region of the cloned segment in order to isolate DNA flanking the *camK* gene. A 5.4 kbp Eco RI fragment, which cross-hybridised to the probe, was cloned from a plasmid sub-library and the nucleotide sequence determined.

Sequence Analysis

A sequence similarity search using the BLASTX program in the SwissProt database assisted in identifying four open reading frames on the 5.4 kbp Eco RI fragment (Fig. 2; ORFs 4–7). In all cases there was a strong bias toward G or C in the wobble position of the codon, which is typical of bacterial species with a high G + C content (Bibb *et al.*, 1984).

The site of hybridisation to the oligonucleotide probe was identified (Fig. 3). This forms part of an open reading frame (ORF 4) which has been reported previously to encode a putative ferredoxin reductase (Grogan *et al.*, 2001b). Two possible ATG start codons (at positions 4228 and 4234) were identified which are both preceded by plausible ribosome-binding sites (7 and 5 bp, respectively). For clarity we have assigned the first ATG (position 4228) as the start codon. The translation product displayed a high degree of sequence conservation to ferredoxin reductases in the SwissProt database including rhodocoxin reductase from *Rhodococcus* sp. strain NI86/21 (Table I).

ORF 5, encoding a polypeptide of 577 amino acids, was identified immediately upstream of ORF 4. The proposed ATG start codon (2498) is preceded by a plausible Shine-Dalgarno sequence (GGAGA) located 9 bp upstream. ORF 5 may be translationally coupled to ORF 4. If we assume that the true start codon for ORF 4 is positioned at 4228 (Fig. 3) then the two ORFs overlap by one nucleotide. Comparison of the translated sequence of ORF 5 with the SwissProt database indicated significant homology to enzymes with ligase activity such as long chain fatty acid CoA ligase (Fernandez-Valverde *et al.*, 1993).

FIGURE 4 Pustell alignment of the translation product of ORF7 with acyl CoA dehydrogenase (ACDS) from *Clostridium acetobutylicum* (accession number P52042). The settings used for the alignment: window size 8; minimum percentage score 55; hash value 2.

a dehydrogenase activity. This could potentially be involved in the formation of 3 or possibly isoketocamphoric acid [7]. ORF2 encodes a polypeptide with homology to several lipid transfer proteins. The function of this protein in terms of camphor degradation is not clear, although intriguingly under certain conditions this protein co-purifies with the camphor hydroxylating cytochrome P450 (G. Grogan, personal communication). Upstream of *camK* on the opposite strand is ORF3 which appears to encode a regulatory protein containing a putative DNA-binding motif (Grogan *et al.*, 2001b).

Further upstream, and transcribed in the same direction as *camK*, is ORF4 which encodes a polypeptide displaying striking similarity to a number of ferredoxin reductases. The initial step in the degradation of camphor involves cytochrome P450 catalysed 6-endo hydroxylation. We have recently purified the cytochrome P450 responsible for catalysing this stereospecific hydroxylation (Grogan *et al.*, 2002) and showed it to be a typical class I enzyme requiring both a ferredoxin and ferredoxin reductase for activity. However, the gene encoding the ferredoxin reductase is not clustered alongside the genes encoding its cognate cytochrome P450 and ferredoxin, as is the case with the inducible cytochrome P450 system responsible for the degradation of the thiocarbamate herbicide EPTC from *Rhodococcus erythropolis* NI86/21 (Nagy *et al.*, 1995).

Immediately upstream and possibly translationally coupled to ORF4 is ORF5 encoding a polypeptide with similarity to acyl-CoA ligases. We speculate that the translation product of ORF5 is responsible for transferring CoASH to either 7 or possibly isohydroxycamphoric acid [6]. This is presumably necessary in preparation for the α,β-dehydrogenation of 7 catalysed by the gene product of ORF7 which appears to encode an acyl CoA dehydrogenase activity. Concomitant decarboxylation carried out by a decarboxylase activity, which has yet to be cloned, will give 9.

The function of the putative racemase encoded by ORF6 is not clear, although it may be involved in the subsequent degradation of this 9-carbon acid. A functional analysis of this gene product requires enzymatic studies and we cannot definitively conclude from the available evidence that the putative ORF protein is involved in camphor degradation.

Interestingly, the unusual preference of GAA over the expected GAG codon for glutamic acid residues, which has been observed for *Rhodococcus* genes (Hart *et al.*, 1990), was not found in any of the ORFs described in this paper. This may indicate that the gene cluster had been acquired by a mechanism such as horizontal gene transfer in the recent evolutionary past. However, this conclusion must be treated with caution since at least two other genes cloned and sequenced from this strain (Roberts *et al.*, 2002) do not display the glutamic acid codon bias typical of *Rhodococcus* genes.

Growth of *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784 on camphor is known to cause induction of at least four enzymes (Grogan *et al.*, 2002). These include a cytochrome P450 which catalyses the hydroxylation of camphor, and 6-oxo camphor hydrolase which catalyses the retro-Claisen ring opening of the diketone metabolite 3 (Grogan *et al.*, 2001b). The identity of the other two proteins (15 and 52 kDa) is unknown, although the smaller band may be the cognate ferredoxin for the cytochrome P450. Northern blot analysis of cells grown in the absence or presence of camphor might allow us to detect transcriptional induction of at least some of the genes. Further work is required to establish the full extent of the camphor-degrading gene cluster.

In conclusion, we have presented the nucleotide sequence of a portion of the gene cluster we believe is

responsible for the degradation of (1R)-(+-)-camphor in *Rhodococcus* sp. NCIMB 9784. Comparison of the deduced ORFs with the SwissProt database has allowed assignment of possible functions. In most cases the array of enzymatic activities can be tentatively assigned to a specific reaction based on the isolation of intermediates from the degradation pathway.
