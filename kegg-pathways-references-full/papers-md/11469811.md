Two isoforms of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD) interconvert the active glucocorticoid, cortisol, and inactive cortisone. 11β-HSD1 is believed to act in vivo predominantly as an oxo-reductase using NADP(H) as a cofactor to generate cortisol. In contrast, 11β-HSD2 acts exclusively as an NAD-dependent dehydrogenase inactivating cortisol to cortisone, thereby protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor from occupation by cortisol. In peripheral tissues, both enzymes serve to control the availability of cortisol to bind to the corticosteroid receptors. Defective expression of 11β-HSD2 is implicated in patients with hypertension and intra-uterine growth retardation, while 11β-HSD1 appears to be intricately involved in the conditions of apparent cortisone reductase deficiency, insulin resistance and visceral obesity.

The ability of peripheral tissues to regulate corticosteroid concentrations through 11β-HSD isozymes is established as an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of diverse human diseases. Modulation of enzyme activity may offer a novel therapeutic approach to treating human disease while circumventing the consequences of systemic glucocorticoid excess or deficiency.

Key words: 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; apparent mineralocorticoid excess; apparent cortisone reductase deficiency; obesity; hypertension.

Glucocorticoids play a pivotal role in the control of metabolism in almost all tissues in the body. At a cellular level, they influence amino acid, fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism and systemically have functional roles within the central and peripheral nervous system, cardiovascular system, connective and lymphoid tissue and endocrine organs including adipose tissue. This is exemplified in conditions of cortisol deficiency and excess. In humans, the principal active glucocorticoid is cortisol. The control of cortisol concentrations that are available to bind to corticosteroid receptors (mineralocorticoid, MR, and glucocorticoid, GR) is critical in determining corticosteroid action and is clearly a balance between synthesis and metabolism. In the past, cortisol

metabolism has been considered to be predominantly effected in the liver and to result in the excretion of inactive metabolites. It is now established that cortisol metabolism can occur in many peripheral tissues and differential regulation within different target tissues may provide an explanation for many diverse disease processes.

# CORTISOL METABOLISM

Cortisol secretion and metabolism are intricately linked and tightly controlled in order to maintain circulating levels. With increasing metabolic clearance of cortisol there is an associated increase in adrenocorticoreceptor hormone (ACTH) secretion and cortisol production as a compensatory mechanism in order to maintain circulating levels. The metabolism of cortisol therefore plays a critical role in determining the activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis.

The metabolism of cortisol is both complex and tissue-dependent. Historically, the liver has been regarded as the major site of cortisol metabolism. However, it has become increasingly recognized that many tissues within the body are capable of metabolizing cortisol. The major steps in cortisol metabolism are shown in Figure I (see also Chapter I). Briefly, cortisol can be converted to the inactive glucocorticoid, cortisone, by the action of the enzyme 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11β-HSD). Both cortisone and cortisol can be acted upon by 5α and 5β-reductases and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, ultimately leading to the generation of tetrahydrocortisone (THE), 5β-tetrahydrocortisol (THF) and 5α-tetrahydrocortisol (allo-THF). Other metabolites of cortisol may also be generated, predominantly in hepatic tissue. Cortisol and cortisone may be hydroxylated at the 6-position to form 6β-hydroxycortisol. Further metabolism may occur via 20β-oxoreductase, leading to the generation of 20β-dihydrocortisol.

11β-HSD has a pivotal role in the metabolism of cortisol. By catalysing the interconversion of active glucocorticoid, cortisol and inactive cortisone, it is able to control the concentration of active glucocorticoid available to bind to GR. Furthermore, it is able to protect the MR from illicit occupation by cortisol. The activity of 11β-HSD in vivo is usually assayed through an assessment of urinary steroid metabolites. By comparing the ratio of tetrahydro-metabolites of cortisol and cortisone ([THF + allo-THF]:THE), an impression of the set-point of cortisol to cortisone conversion within the body can be achieved. While this is felt to reflect most accurately the activity of the hepatic isoform of 11β-HSD (11β-HSD1 – see below), the ratio of urinary free cortisol to cortisone ratio (UFF : UFE) most accurately reflects the activity of renal 11β-HSD (11β-HSD2). Further clinical assessments of 11β-HSD activity have been made using dexamethasone suppressed cortisol day profiles during which the conversion of an oral dose of cortisone acetate to cortisol by liver 11β-HSD can be observed via sequential serum sampling.

# 11β-HYDROXYSTEROID DEHYDROGENASES

11β-HSDs are members of the short-chain alcohol dehydrogenase superfamily. The mature protein consists of several highly conserved regions that include an anchoring site thought to be responsible for ensuring location within the microsome, cofactor binding and catalytic domains.

Figure 2. Two isoforms of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. Type 1, in vivo, functions almost exclusively as a reductase generating cortisol from inactive cortisone. Type 2 functions as a dehydrogenase inactivating cortisol and thus protecting the mineralocorticoid receptor.

To date, two isoforms of 11β-HSD have been extensively characterized. 11β-HSD1 was originally isolated from rat liver. The gene is located on chromosome 1q32.2 and includes six exons. The gene is over 30 kb in length, which is largely attributed to the length of intron 4 (25 kb), and it encodes a 34 kDa protein. The enzyme resides within the endoplasmic reticulum and activity is NADP(H)-dependent. The type 1 enzyme is bi-directional, possessing both dehydrogenase (cortisol to cortisone) and reductase (cortisone to cortisol) activity. While in tissue homogenates the dehydrogenase activity appears to predominate, in vivo the enzyme appears to function almost exclusively as a high-affinity reductase, generating active glucocorticoid, cortisol, from inactive cortisone. Affinity constants reflect the substrate specificity (cortisone K_m 270 nM cortisol K_m 1.8 μM).

The HSD11B2 gene is found on chromosome 16q22 and comprises five exons. The nucleotide-binding domain is located in exon 1 and 2 and the catalytic domain in exon 4. The gene is approximately 6.2 kb in length and encodes a 44 kDa protein that possesses only NAD-dependent dehydrogenase activity, inactivating cortisol to cortisone with an approximate K_m of 50 nM (Figure 2). The enzyme is located to the endoplasmic reticulum although perinuclear localization has been demonstrated. 11β-HSD1 and 11β-HSD2 share only 21% sequence homology.

## EXPRESSION AND REGULATION OF 11β-HSDs

Using a variety of techniques that include specific enzyme activity assays, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization and Western blotting, differential tissue-specific expression of these enzymes has been identified. 11β-HSD1 is widely distributed in many human tissues, including liver, adipose, gonad, bone, ocular tissues, vascular smooth muscle and skin. 11β-HSD2 is the predominant isoform in kidney, placenta, the developing fetus, GI tract, glandular tissue including salivary and sweat glands, and epithelial tissue, including the lung. A summary of existing human tissue expression data is presented in Table 1. Using primary cultures of human hepatocytes, the activity of 11β-HSD1 is almost exclusively oxo-reductase generating active glucocorticoid, cortisol. Results from tissue homogenates show a propensity for the type 1 enzyme to display dehydrogenase activity. The explanation for the difference in behaviour

between tissue homogenates and primary cultures remains unclear, although this may reflect unstable reductase activity in homogenates. 11β-HSD2 is principally, although not exclusively located in mineralocorticoid responsive tissues. Within the kidney, 11β-HSD2 is found in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting ducts.[22,23] There appears to be little or no expression of 11β-HSD1 in adult human kidney, although proximal tubular expression has been shown in both rat and mouse. 11β-HSD2 is expressed in large quantities in human placenta and dramatically reduces the concentration of cortisol within the umbilical circulation thus protecting the fetus from the relatively high concentrations of glucocorticoids seen in the adult. Within the feto-placental unit, 11β-HSD2 is expressed within the syncytiotrophoblasts[14,27] while 11β-HSD1 is expressed in the chorion and decidua.[24] During fetal development 11β-HSD expression appears tightly controlled and regulated. In both the mouse and human fetus there is initially widespread expression of 11β-HSD2. With subsequent fetal development, expression of 11β-HSD2 decreases and ultimately persists only in the kidney, colon and parts of the central nervous system.[28–30]

Studies have addressed the regulation of activity and expression of 11β-HSDs. Within the rat liver, 11β-HSD1 is expressed in a sexually dimorphic pattern, with lower activity in females compared to males.[31] This is explained by the pattern of growth hormone (GH) secretion; exposing hypophysectomized male rats to a female pattern of GH secretion decreases the level of 11β-HSD1 expression to that seen in females. Further evidence as to the regulation of 11β-HSD1 by GH in humans is derived from clinical studies on acromegalic patients and hypopituitary patients with and without GH replacement therapy. The urinary [THF + allo-THF]:THE ratio is elevated in patients with GH deficiency and returns to normal with replacement therapy.[32] Similarly, in patients with active acromegaly, there is a decrease in the ratio that corrects with suppression of GH levels.[33] In humans there is also evidence for sexual dimorphism of 11βHSD1 activity in hypopituitary adults,[34] but not in normal controls.[35] Growth hormone appears to have few direct effects upon activity and expression of 11β-HSDs in vitro[26,33], with the exception of a single study that demonstrated inhibition of 11β-HSD1 in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.[36] However, IGF-I appears specifically to inhibit 11β-HSD1 and not 11β-HSD2 and it is likely that many of the clinically observed effects of GH on 11β-HSD1 activity may be explained by the action of IGF-I.[33]

Many other factors have been found to regulate 11β-HSD activity and expression in vitro and in vivo. In many cases the functional significance of these observations remains to be elucidated. Pro-inflammatory cytokines appear to enhance universally the activity and expression of 11β-HSD1 in a variety of human primary cultures and cell lines[37–40] and it is exciting to speculate that regulation of 11β-HSD1, and hence local cortisol generation, may be involved in the acute inflammatory response. Glucocorticoids regulate both 11β-HSD1 and 2.[26,36,41–50] Although some conflicting data exist, dexamethasone appears to up-regulate activity and expression of both isoforms. Conversely, insulin either inhibits, or has no effect upon 11β-HSD1 activity in the majority of model systems analysed.[36,42,45,47,51] Gonadotrophins and sex steroids are potent regulators of 11β-HSD activity.[25,40,43,46,52–55] Both LH and FSH have been shown to increase the expression of 11β-HSD1 in rat cell models. The effect of progesterone is to inhibit activity and expression, while the data with respect to oestradiol are less clear. Increased and decreased activity and expression have been documented in a variety of in vivo and in vitro models, suggesting tissue and species specific regulation. Both in vivo and in vitro regulation of 11β-HSD by thyroid hormones has been demonstrated.[56–59] They appear to predominantly inhibit 11β-HSD1 with no effect on 11β-HSD2. Finally,

variety of pharmacological agents have also been shown to modulate 11β-HSD activity and expression. A summary of regulation data is presented in Table 2.

## 11β-HSDs AND HUMAN DISEASE

### 11β-HSD2

#### Apparent mineralocorticoid excess

Apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME) is a rare inherited form of hypertension; approximately 50 cases have been reported. The syndrome presents with low birth weight or, in infancy, the child may fail to thrive or have short stature. Hypertension and hypokalaemia may be severe and contribute to excess mortality. Hypokalaemia may

result in arrhythmias, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and rhabdomyolysis. Both plasma renin activity and aldosterone levels are suppressed in all cases of AME. The diagnosis, apart from clinical phenotype, is largely based upon characteristic findings on urinary steroid metabolite analysis. Patients excrete little if any of the tetrahydrometabolites of cortisol (THE) such that the ratio of [THF + allo-THF]:THE in patients with AME may range from 8 to 80 (normal range 0.7–1.3). Furthermore, there also appears to be an additional abnormality of 5β-reductase activity. In patients with AME the allo-THF:THF ratio is invariably elevated indicating a preference for the 5α reduced metabolites. In addition, the urinary free cortisol to cortisone ratio, which perhaps most accurately reflects the activity of renal 11β-HSD2, is dramatically elevated in patients with AME; indeed, the excretion of free cortisone may be undetectable. All of these measures indicate a profound defect in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone (conversion of cortisone to cortisol is normal). The half-life of cortisol is prolonged in AME as a consequence of the inhibition of cortisol to cortisone conversion. As a compensatory mechanism, the endogenous cortisol secretion rate is reduced so as to maintain normal circulating corticosteroid levels.

There is also a milder variant of AME, previously termed the type II variant. Clinically, patients present later in life, usually in adolescence, with hypertension and hypokalaemia, although much less severe than the type I variant. While the [THF + allo-THF]:THE ratio may be mildly abnormal (although far less marked than in classical AME), there is a dramatic elevation of the urinary UFF:UFE ratio, again suggesting a predominant defect in renal 11β-HSD2 activity.

Familial studies suggest an autosomal recessive form of inheritance and that the molecular basis for both type I and type II can be explained by defects in the HSD11B2 gene. Inactive or defective mutant enzymes fail to inactivate cortisol to cortisone. As a result, cortisol is able to compete with aldosterone, bind to, and activate the MR (Figure 3), causing sodium retention, suppression of the PRA/aldosterone axis and mineralocorticoid hypertension. More than 20 mutations have been identified in the

genes of patients with AME type I. A summary of their location within the HSD11B2 gene is shown in Figure 4. With the exception of four compound heterozygotes, all have been homozygous mutations. The resulting gene products have either no, or markedly reduced enzyme activity as would be predicted from their clinical phenotype. Heterozygotes appear clinically normal, although in vitro work has suggested that heteromeric 11β-HSD2 formation may compromise activity and, indeed, in one kindred both parents had evidence of mineralocorticoid-based hypertension and in another the father of an affected child was hypertensive and displayed an abnormal [THF + allo-THF]:THE ratio.

The molecular basis for the type II variant of AME is also explained by mutations in the HSD11B2 gene. One extensive Sardinian kindred has been studied in detail. All have an identical homozygous mutation which results in a minor decrease in enzyme activity of the gene product. Mutations in HSD11B2 have been expressed in mammalian cells, and this has allowed significant correlations to be made between genotype and clinical phenotype, notably, urinary cortisol:cortisone ratio, age at presentation and birth weight.

The treatment aims in the management of both type I and type II AME are to control hypertension and to correct life-threatening hypokalaemia. Triamterene and amiloride have both been used individually and in combination. Dexamethasone has been used successfully to suppress endogenous cortisol production. Control of hypertension can

be difficult and multiple anti-hypertensive agent classes are often needed in order to achieve therapeutic targets. Failure to thrive and growth retardation often respond to correction of hypokalaemia.

### Liquorice consumption and carbenoxolone therapy

Liquorice has been used as both a medication and a confectionery for hundreds of years. The active component of liquorice is glycyrrhetinic acid (GE), and the use of liquorice as an anti-indigestion remedy ultimately led to the use of a derivative of GE, 18β-glycyrrhetinic acid, in the development of the anti-ulcer drug, carbenoxolone. The mineralocorticoid side-effects of both liquorice and carbenoxolone are well documented and include oedema and hypertension and may occur at relatively low doses. At its most extreme, the effects of excess liquorice consumption can cause severe hypertension and potentially life-threatening hypokalaemia. It was initially postulated that the active components of liquorice acted through the MR; however, they have very low affinity for the MR and their side-effect profile depends upon an intact HPA axis. It is now established that the active components of both liquorice and carbenoxolone inhibit 11β-HSD2 to account for their mineralocorticoid effects. Treatment with spironolactone ameliorates these side-effects. The clinical picture is one of an acquired form of AME as a result of cortisol-induced mineralocorticoid excess. ${}^{71}$

### Essential hypertension

11β-HSD2 may be involved in the pathophysiology of essential hypertension. This is discussed in Chapter 7.

### Ectopic ACTH syndrome

Patients with Cushing’s syndrome secondary to ectopic ACTH production almost without exception develop hypertension with hypokalaemic alkalosis due to a state of mineralocorticoid excess. This is explained on the basis of exceedingly high concentrations of cortisol which saturate 11β-HSD2 such that it is unable to inactivate all available cortisol to cortisone. UFE is at a maximal level, but cortisol spills over to act on the MR. Both the UFF:UFE and [THF + allo-THF]:THE ratios are dramatically elevated, not reflecting a defect in the conversion of cortisol to cortisone but the vastly increased substrate concentration. ${}^{3,72}$ Hypertension is a common feature in other causes of Cushing’s syndrome, but its pathogenesis remains unclear. These patients do not develop a state of mineralocorticoid excess and their urinary steroid profiles show only minor elevations of the [THF + allo-THF]:THE and UFF:UFE ratios. ${}^{3}$ While their hypertension is likely to be multi-factorial, the abnormalities of urinary steroid ratios indicate that abnormalities of 11β-HSDs may play a role.

### 11β-HSD1

#### Apparent cortisone reductase deficiency and polycystic ovary syndrome

Apparent cortisone reductase deficiency (ACRD) is in many ways the exact opposite of AME. Patients display a defect in the conversion of cortisone to cortisol, suggesting inhibition of 11-oxo-reductase activity and therefore, by implication, inhibition of 11β-HSD1. Eight cases have been described; all with one exception are female. ${}^{73–78}$ A

summary of the clinical features and biochemical abnormalities of all the reported cases is presented in **Table 3**. Cortisol metabolism is increased and as a consequence ACTH secretion is elevated, increasing cortisol secretion and also adrenal androgen production. Circulating cortisol levels are normal. Urinary tetrahydro-metabolites show almost exclusively THE with little or no detectable THF or allo-THF ([THF + allo-THF]:THE ratio < 0.05). Further studies have also shown impaired cortisol generation following an oral dose of cortisone acetate.⁷⁹ This biochemical evidence would strongly implicate a defect in 11β-HSD1 as being causative in the syndrome of ACRD. To date, despite extensive investigations, no mutations have been identified in the *HSD11B1* gene; however, the genes from only four of these patients have been sequenced and further genetic studies are needed. Dexamethasone treatment to suppress ACTH has been used with some success to control the hyperandrogenism in these cases.

Patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) share many of the same clinical characteristics as those with ACRD. While there is evidence to support increased cortisol secretion rates in PCOS, perhaps indicative of a defect in cortisone to cortisol conversion, there remains to be a consensus with respect to [THF + allo-THF]:THE ratios. Both normal and decreased ratios have been reported in the published literature.⁸⁰–⁸²

### Other medical conditions

11β-HSD1, but not 11β-HSD2, is expressed within granulosa-lutein cells and has been implicated in determining the outcome of in vitro fertilization (IVF). Some studies have demonstrated the association of 11β-HSD1 with poor pregnancy rates following IVF.⁸³,⁸⁴ However, other studies have failed to correlate either activity or expression of 11β-HSD1 with successful pregnancy rates.⁹⁵

Although grossly phenotypically normal, 11β-HSD1 knockout mice resist stress-induced hyperglycaemia and have attenuated hepatic gluconeogenesis⁸⁶ thus implicating 11β-HSD1 as an important regulator of hepatic glucose flux. This together with the observation that healthy volunteers taking carbenoxolone (an inhibitor of 11β-HSDs) display improved insulin sensitivity⁸⁷ has strongly suggested that 11β-HSDs may be intricately involved in the pathology of insulin resistance. Further, 11βHSO1, in adipose tissue may be important in obesity.⁹⁹ These intriguing possibilities are discussed in Chapter 7.

The recent identification of 11β-HSD1 within bone has many implications, not least as a crucial role in the determination of the susceptibility to glucocorticoid induced osteoporosis.¹³ 11β-HSD1 may also have a role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory arthritides in the light of evidence to suggest modulation of activity by pro-inflammatory cytokines.

In the rodent central nervous system, inhibition of 11β-HSD1 reduces glucocorticoid potentiated hippocampal neuronal toxicity. It is therefore exciting to speculate that 11β-HSD1 may have a role in memory, and also perhaps in the pathology of conditions such as Alzheimer’s disease.⁸⁸

## SUMMARY

11β-HSDs play a pivotal role in the metabolism of cortisol, tightly controlling the exact concentration of cortisol that is available to bind to the GR (11β-HSD1) and protecting

Practice points
- in low-renin low-aldosterone mineralocorticoid excess, consider congenital or acquired (e.g. liquorice-induced) 11β-HSD2 deficiency
- 11HSD1 deficiency is a very rare cause of hirsutism in women, but might be detected more frequently by the use of urinary cortisol metabolite profiles as described in Chapter 1. These would reveal the characteristically low ratio cortisol to cortisone metabolites in urine

Research agenda
- to establish the relevance of 11βHSDs to common diseases, including refining the importance of genetic polymorphisms
- to establish the determinants of the directionality of 11βHSD1
- to identify selective inhibitors of each isozyme
- to measure tissue- and isozyme-specific changes in 11βHSD isozyme activities

the MR from illicit occupation by cortisol (11β-HSD2). The two isoforms identified to date interconvert cortisol and cortisone, type 1 acting principally as a reductase in vivo to generate cortisol and type 2 acting exclusively as a dehydrogenase to inactivate cortisol to cortisone. Inhibition of 11β-HSD2 underpins the mineralocorticoid hypertension induced by liquorice consumption and carbenoxolone therapy. Defects in the HSD11B2 gene are responsible for both variants of AME, the close relationship between genotype and phenotype in this condition raising the possibility that milder forms of AME or polymorphisms within the HSD11B2 gene may be implicated in the pathogenesis of essential hypertension. While the clinical syndrome of ACRD suggests a defect in 11β-HSD1, no causative mutations as yet have been identified in the HSD11B1 gene and further genetic evaluation is required. 11β-HSD1 appears intricately involved in the pathogenesis of central obesity in both normal and hypopituitary patients. The exact role of 11β-HSDs in other common medical conditions such as insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome remains to be clarified.
