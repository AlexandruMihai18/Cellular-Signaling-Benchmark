Colanic acid (CA) is an extracellular polysaccharide produced by most *Escherichia coli* strains as well as by other species of the family *Enterobacteriaceae*. We have determined the sequence of a 23-kb segment of the *E. coli* K-12 chromosome which includes the cluster of genes necessary for production of CA. The CA cluster comprises 19 genes. Two other sequenced genes (*orf1.3* and *galF*), which are situated between the CA cluster and the O-antigen cluster, were shown to be unnecessary for CA production. The CA cluster includes genes for synthesis of GDP-L-fucose, one of the precursors of CA, and the gene for one of the enzymes in this pathway (GDP-D-mannose 4,6-dehydratase) was identified by biochemical assay. Six of the inferred proteins show sequence similarity to glycosyl transferases, and two others have sequence similarity to acetyl transferases. Another gene (*wzx*) is predicted to encode a protein with multiple transmembrane segments and may function in export of the CA repeat unit from the cytoplasm into the periplasm in a process analogous to O-unit export. The first three genes of the cluster are predicted to encode an outer membrane lipoprotein, a phosphatase, and an inner membrane protein with an ATP-binding domain. Since homologs of these genes are found in other extracellular polysaccharide gene clusters, they may have a common function, such as export of polysaccharide from the cell.

Polysaccharides are important constituents of the surface of the bacterial cell, and they play a critical role in its interaction with the environment. Many bacteria produce extracellular polysaccharides (EPSs), which can remain attached to the cell in a capsular form or alternatively be released as a slime. Gram-negative bacteria also produce lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which forms part of the outer membrane and which has a polysaccharide component called the O antigen. These polysaccharides are prominent antigens and are structurally and serologically diverse. In *Escherichia coli* serological studies have so far found 173 O antigens and 80 capsular antigens (K antigens) (63, 89). The *E. coli* K antigens have been divided into four groups (IA, IB, II, and III) based on a variety of criteria (33, 34, 64, 66). Colanic acid (CA) or M antigen (Fig. 1) is an EPS which is widely found within *E. coli*, as well as within other species of the family *Enterobacteriaceae* (28). This is in contrast to the K antigens, each of which is found in only a small proportion of *E. coli* strains. It has been suggested that CA is important for survival of *E. coli* outside the host and perhaps has a role in resistance to desiccation (62).

CA resembles the group IA capsular polysaccharides in several respects: high molecular weight, sugar composition, and the chromosomal location near *his* of the responsible biosynthetic genes (83). Furthermore, it has also been shown that synthesis of type I capsular polysaccharides is under control of *rcs* (regulator of capsule synthesis) genes, *rcsA*, *rcsB*, and *rcsC* (38), previously described as a control system for CA (for reviews, see references 26 and 27). Over the years there has been considerable interest in the transcriptional control of CA expression. Despite this interest, little is known about the nature of the genes responsible for CA production. In *E. coli* K-12 these genes map to a region (formerly *cps*) (83), which is

upstream of the genes (formerly *rfb*) for production of O antigen. (In this paper we have renamed some genes and loci in accordance with a proposed new polysaccharide gene nomenclature (70) which it is hoped will do away with ambiguous and confusing gene names which have been accruing.) We have previously determined the DNA sequence of a ~6-kb segment of the K-12 CA gene cluster (4), and in this paper we report the completion of the sequencing of the entire gene cluster.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

Strains and plasmids. *E. coli* K-12 strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Cultures for general use were grown at 37°C in nutrient broth (NB) (peptone, 10 g/liter; yeast extract [Gibco], 5 g/liter; sodium chloride, 5 g/liter) or on nutrient agar plates (1.5% bacteriological agar in NB). Antibiotics were added (when appropriate) to the following concentrations: ampicillin, 25 μg/ml; kanamycin, 50 μg/ml; tetracycline, 16 μg/ml.

General DNA manipulations. DNA manipulations, including PCR, restriction digestion, and ligations, were performed by standard methods (76). PCR fragments were cloned in the plasmid vector pGEM5Zf(+) by using the pGEM-T A-T cloning system (ProMega Corp.).

DNA sequencing. Random subclones of pPR1653 (Table 1 and Fig. 2) were created by partial digestion of the insert with DNaseI and cloning of the resulting fragments in pGEM7Zf(+). Preparations of double-stranded DNA of these plasmids were used as templates in sequencing reactions. The templates for all other sequencing reactions were PCR products produced with oligonucleotides tagged with the forward or reverse M13 sequencing primers. Thermocycle sequencing reactions based on the dideoxy termination method (77) were run in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA Thermal Cycler using a procedure recommended by Perkin-Elmer Cetus. The reactions used primers labelled with the appropriate fluorescent dye and were run on an Applied Biosystems 373A automated DNA sequencer.

Sequence analysis. Computer programs for the editing and analysis of DNA were accessed through the Australian National Genomic Information Service (ANGIS) (71). Sequence data were assembled into contigs with the XDAP program (23). Sequence databases were searched with the National Center for Biotechnology Information BLAST network server (2). Analysis of open reading frames (ORFs) was carried out using the nucleotide interpretation program (80). Several Genetics Computer Group package (15) programs were used, including PILEUP for aligning multiple sequences and BESTFIT for pairwise sequence comparisons. The program RDF2 (67) was used to assess the statistical significance of pairwise alignments. The program ALOM (41) was used to identify potential transmembrane segments.

GMD assay. *gmd* was amplified with primers 471 (5′-AATCCCGCAGTGGT GATACGC-3′) and 472 (5′-CGCCTGATGGCGGAACCGACC-3′). The PCR

cia) was inserted into the EcoRI site. The primers used for PCR amplifications were as follows: 621 (5'-ATGCCATCTAAAAACTCTC-3') and 668 (5'-AAA GAATTCTCAGCATTGGCATCAACGG-3') for the left-hand end of the pPR1742 insert, 667 (5'-AAAGAATTCACTGGAACGTACTCAGCC-3') and 679 (5'-GGTGCATCACTGGCATCCG-3') for the right-hand end of the pPR1742 insert, 622 (5'-ATGAAGGTCGGCTTCTTTTAC-3') and 694 (5'-A AAGAATTCTCCC GCAAGGCCTATGCC-3') for the left-hand end of the pPR1743 insert, 693 (5'-AAAGAATTCTGACCATGTCATCGAGCG-3') and 679 for the right-hand end of the pPR1743 insert, 687 (5'-TGAAAGGGCAA CTGGCGC-3') and 720 (5'-AAAGAATTCTCCGGCCCCACAGATCGC-3') for the left-hand end of the pPR1744 insert, and 721 (5'-AAAGAATTCTCAG CAACTGTTTCGCGC-3') and 686 (5'-CCACGAAACGTCTTTGCGC-3') for the right-hand end of the pPR1744 insert.

The mutations were transferred into the *E. coli* chromosome by homologous recombination. The cloned DNA incorporating the kanamycin gene cassette was purified and the linear DNA fragment was then electroporated into the *E. coli* recD strain V355. Transformants were selected on kanamycin, and putative recombinants were screened for ampicillin sensitivity (i.e., original donor plasmid not present) and subsequently tested by PCR for the presence of the kanamycin resistance cassette at the expected site. In each of these confirmatory PCR reactions the primers used were on either side of the target site, and one was located outside of the segment of donor DNA. As expected, chromosomal DNA from mutants gave rise to amplification products of ~1.3 kb (i.e., the size of the inserted kanamycin resistance gene cassette) larger than was the case with a wild-type control. The ability of mutants to produce colanic acid was tested by introducing the plasmid pATC400 (which induces expression of colanic acid genes) and looking for the characteristic mucoid colonial morphology.

wcaL was amplified with primers 698 (5'-GGTTGCGGATCCCTTAGCCAG C-3') and 699 (5'-AGATGGCATGCGGTTCTCCTC-3'). The PCR product was cloned by using the pGEM-T system to give pPR1745 in which wcaL is in the opposite transcriptional orientation to lacZ. The pPR1745 insert was then subcloned in pACYC184 to give pPR1746 (Table 1), which was used to complement the mutation in P5340.

Nucleotide sequence accession number. The DNA sequence has been submitted to the GenBank and EMBL databases and assigned the accession number U38473.

## RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Size of the CA gene cluster. The promoter region of the CA gene cluster has recently been studied and sequenced (81a). We took this to be the 5' end of the cluster and extended the sequence from the promoter region through our previously published sequence (4) to the beginning of the O-antigen gene

Generation of kanamycin resistance insertions. Recombinant plasmids pPR1742, pPR1743, and pPR1744 (Table 1 and Fig. 2) have insertional mutations in the cloned genes wcaL, orf1.3, and galF, respectively, and were created as follows. In each case two PCR reactions were performed to give amplification products which contained a portion of the target gene together with some flanking DNA. The PCR primers within the target gene incorporate an EcoRI site and this was used in joining the two PCR fragments together: each pair of segments was cloned together in the plasmid vector pGEM5Zf(+) in such a way as to give a construct with a novel and unique EcoRI site within the reconstituted target gene. The GenBlock EcoRI kanamycin resistance gene cassette (Pharma-

FIG. 2. Genetic organization of the $w c a (c p s)$ region responsible for production of CA. The scale shows the location (in kilobases) on the Eco6 physical map of the $E$. coli K-12 chromosome (74). Horizontal lines represent the inserts of recombinant clones (Table 1). Triangles show the point of insertion of a kanamycin gene cassette used in mutagenesis. Arrows represent genes, which are transcribed in a rightward direction. $r m l B(r f b B)$ is the first gene of the O-antigen gene cluster (81), and $a s m A$ is a gene involved in assembly of outer membrane proteins (54); neither is involved in CA production. The DNA sequence of the region between $a s m A$ and $w z a$ is not known. The sequenced ORFs (1 to 21) under consideration are shown, together with the sizes of predicted translation products. Gene names have been assigned to ORFs in accordance with the proposal of Reeves et al. (70): $m a n B$, $m a n C$, and $g m d$ have established functions in the GDP-L-fucose biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 3); $w z a$, $w z b$, $w z c$, and $w z x$ appear to have a general role in EPS production; and other genes implicated in CA production have been given $w c a$ names (A to L). $o r f 1.3$ and $g a l F$ have no demonstrable role in CA production. Six of the CA genes ($g m d$, $w c a G H I$, and $m a n C B$) were previously sequenced (4) and were called (respectively) $o r f 0.0$, $o r f 0.9$, $o r f 1.9$, $o r f 2.4$, and $c p s B G . w c a L$, $o r f 1.3$, and $g a l F$ are equivalent to the $S$. enterica LT2 genes called $o r f 0.0$, $o r f 1.3$, and $o r f 2.8$ by Jiang et al. (35). The graph shows GC content of the $w c a$ cluster (mean value calculated for a window of 101 bases), and individual gene GC contents are also given.

cluster (81) (Fig. 2). This segment of DNA is 23 kb in length (Fig. 2). The promoter region is followed after about 60 bp by a JUMPstart sequence (81a), a highly conserved 39-bp element which is found upstream of many polysaccharide gene clusters (30). There are then 21 open reading frames all in the same transcriptional orientation (Fig. 2). The first of these begins 179 bp downstream of the JUMPstart sequence, and the last ends 373 bp upstream of $r m l B(r f b B)$, the first gene of the O-antigen gene cluster. There is only one obvious transcriptional termination sequence in the region sequenced which is a 25-bp inverted repeat sequence 41 bp downstream of $o r f 21$ ($g a l F$; see below), and 161 bp upstream of the JUMPstart sequence which precedes the O antigen gene cluster. This suggests that the 21 genes are part of a single large transcription unit, but this has not been tested experimentally. Also, $g a l F$ is preceded by a potential promoter sequence (35) and so may also be independently transcribed.

$o r f 19$, $o r f 20$, and $o r f 21$ of this study are equivalent to $o r f 0.0$, $o r f 1.3$, and $o r f 2.8$ of Salmonella enterica LT2 (35). It has been suggested (35, 86) that $S$. enterica $o r f 2.8$ could be the gene $g a l F$, identified by mutation and reported to have an effect on the chromatographic behavior of UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (57–59, 61). Recent work (83a) indicates that $o r f 2.8$ does indeed encode functions similar to those described for $g a l F$, confirming that it is the $g a l F$ gene described previously.

The 3′ end of the CA gene cluster was studied by making insertions in $o r f 19$, $o r f 20$, and $g a l F$ in strain V355. The effect of these mutations on CA synthesis was determined by adding the $r c s A$-containing plasmid pATC400. RcsA is a positive control protein for the CA cluster, and $r c s A$ on a multicopy plasmid confers mucoidy to a strain (75). After addition of pATC400 strains P5336 and P5338 (carrying insertions in $o r f 20$ or $g a l F$, respectively) were mucoid. In contrast, P5340 carrying an insertion in $o r f 19$ was nonmucoid. The defect in P5340 was corrected by introducing a second plasmid (pPR1746) carrying $o r f 19$, confirming that the only defect in P5340 was the insertion into $o r f 19$. We conclude that $o r f 19$ is required for CA synthesis and is part of the CA gene cluster and name it $w c a L$, and we also give $w c a$ gene names to all ORFs upstream of $w c a L$ where appropriate (Fig. 2).

$g a l F$ is clearly not necessary for synthesis of CA. $g a l F$ is a homolog of $g a l U$ (58% sequence identity at the amino acid level) but apparently cannot compensate for loss of $g a l U$ function since $g a l U$ mutants are defective in production of CA (86, 87). In $S$. enterica the effect of deletion of $g a l F$ is to change the kinetics of UDP-glucose synthase (57–59). While this may relate to regulation of synthesis of UDP-galactose for either LPS or CA synthesis, the loss of $g a l F$ was not expected to lead to loss of ability to synthesize CA, and the data confirm this. $o r f 20$ is also unnecessary for synthesis of CA, although it should be

Other abbreviations are as in Fig. 1.

noted that the CA repeat unit has a three-sugar side branch and it is possible that a mutation in one of the side branch transferases would not affect polymerization of the incomplete repeat unit. Thus, although it is not proven, it is still quite possible that *orf20* is part of the CA gene cluster, but demonstration of a role in CA synthesis must await future research. We have therefore not given this *orf* a *wca* gene name but rename it *orf1.3* to maintain consistent nomenclature with *S.* enterica.

The CA gene cluster then comprises 19 or 20 genes. On the basis of sequence characteristics we have been able to assign possible functions to most of the CA genes (Fig. 3).

Genes for synthesis of nucleotide sugar precursors of CA. Genes responsible for production of the nucleotide sugars used as building blocks in polysaccharide synthesis are often found at the polysaccharide gene loci. Of the four different nucleotide sugars necessary for production of the CA repeat unit (the E unit), two (UDP-d-glucose and UDP-d-galactose) are used by the cell for other purposes and housekeeping genes responsible for their production (*galU*, *galT*, *galK*, and *galE*; Fig. 3) are located elsewhere on the K-12 chromosome.

Synthesis of a third CA sugar (UDP-d-glucuronic acid) from

UDP-d-glucose is catalyzed by a single enzyme, UDP-glucose dehydrogenase (UGD). The *hasB* gene encoding UGD has been identified in *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (17). A very similar gene (*ugd*, with 55% amino acid identity to *hasB*) has been found in *E. coli* O111, *E. coli* Flexneri, and *S.* enterica LT2 in the region between *gnd* and *cld* (6, 56), and probably has the same function. Although this region has not yet been sequenced in K-12, it is very likely that *ugd* will also be found there. It is interesting to note that *ugd*, while not within *wca*, is nevertheless in the same vicinity of the chromosome (about 13 kb downstream of *wca*).

The fourth nucleotide sugar necessary for E-unit production is GDP-L-fucose, which is derived from mannose-6-phosphate (Fig. 2). Genes for production of this sugar reside within the CA gene cluster, and we have previously reported on likely candidates for some of the steps (4). The roles of the genes which act first in the pathway, *manB* and *manC* (*orf14* and *orf15*, formerly called *cpsG* and *cpsB*, respectively [4, 70]), are quite well established: they encode, respectively, phosphomannomutase and mannose-1-phosphate guanosyltransferase, which convert D-mannose-6-phosphate into GDP-d-mannose. The next enzyme in the pathway is GMD, which produces

GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose. Previously (4) we suggested that the gene most likely to encode GMD is *orf10* (which we partly sequenced and called then *orf0.0*) because it is very closely related to genes involved in other biochemical pathways in which we would also expect to find GMD (those for synthesis of colitose and perosamine [7, 82]). To test this assignment we looked for GMD activity in a *wca*-deleted strain (SØ874) harboring pPR1689, a plasmid in which *orf10* was cloned. When a crude extract of protein from this strain was assayed for GMD activity, it was found to produce 0.14 μmol of product per hour per milligram of protein, whereas control strains (P4052 alone and P4052 carrying the plasmid vector only) showed negligible amounts of GMD activity. These results show that *orf10* directs the expression of GMD, and so this gene was assigned the name *gmd*.

The final steps in the GDP-L-fucose pathway are epimerization of GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose at C3 and C5 and reduction at C4. In porcine liver only a single enzyme, an “epimerase-reductase,” is necessary for the final steps to GDP-L-fucose (10), but it is not known whether one or two genes will be required in the case of *E. coli*. Although we have not yet studied this part of the pathway experimentally, both *wcaG* and *wcaH* (*orf11* and *orf12*) are perhaps implicated in these steps because of their location between other fucose pathway genes (i.e., *gmd* and *manC*) and because similar genes (*orf6.7* and *orf3.4*, with 37 and 46% amino acid identity, respectively) are present in part of the *wba* (*rfb*) region of *E. coli* O111 believed to be responsible for the colitose pathway in which there are probably analogous reduction and epimerization steps (7). Indeed, the predicted WcaG protein is homologous to a number of other sugar pathway enzymes and has a NAD-binding sequence motif consistent with the fact that the C4 reduction step utilizes NADPH (22).

**Glycosyl transferase genes.** The E unit is synthesized at the cytoplasmic face of the inner membrane on a lipid carrier, probably undecaprenolpyrophosphate (Und-PP) (36). It is reasonable to expect that six of the *wca* genes encode specific glycosyl transferases which utilize nucleotidyated sugars to add the sugars in turn to the growing E unit. The first sugar added is glucose (36) which is attached by adding glucose-1-phosphate to Und-P. We propose that the initiating glucose-1-phosphate transferase is encoded by *wcaJ* because of its similarity to the initiating galactose-1-phosphate transferase WbaP (RfbP) used in O-unit synthesis in a group of related *S.* enterica serogroups (35, 69). The sequence similarity between WcaJ and WbaP is in the C-terminal region, which we have shown to encode the transferase activity (85), but interestingly the N-terminal portions show the same distribution of four hydrophobic segments which may traverse the inner membrane. WcaJ is similar over its entire length to ORF14 (62% identity) from the *Klebsiella pneumoniae* K2 *cps* cluster (5) and to GumD (36% identity) from the *Xanthomonas campestris gum* gene cluster responsible for production of the EPS xanthan (84). The three proteins may perform the same function since like CA the *K. pneumoniae* K2 capsule and xanthan gum both have glucose in their repeat units, and in the latter it has been shown that glucose-1-phosphate is the first residue to be transferred to a lipid carrier during xanthan synthesis (32).

WcaA, WcaC, WcaE, WcaL, and WcaI all show some sequence similarity to other glycosyl transferases (Fig. 4) and are therefore good candidates for the other five glycosyl transferases proposed to be necessary for E-unit synthesis. Of the five genes, only *wcaL* has a closely related gene in the database: it is very similar (52% amino acid identity) to an *Erwinia amylovora* gene (*amsK*) involved in the synthesis of the EPS amylovoran (8), indicating that the two genes share a similar

function. The resemblance of the E-unit side chain to part of the amylovoran structure suggests that possible roles for WcaL are either as the GlcA transferase or as the final Gal transferase. The location of *wcaI* within the set of fucose biosynthetic genes suggests the possibility that it may encode a fucosyl transferase.

**Acetyltransferase genes.** *wcaB* and *wcaF* (Fig. 2) both encode proteins which are clearly related to a large family of proteins that act as acetyltransferases. WcaB is most closely related to CysE, the serine acetyltransferase involved in cysteine biosynthesis (37% identity over 103 amino acids). WcaF is most closely related to NodL, an acetyltransferase involved in the O acetylation of *Rhizobium* Nod factors (30% sequence identity over 124 amino acids). Presumably either WcaB or WcaF is responsible for addition of the acetyl group that is attached through an O linkage to the first fucosyl residue of the E unit (Fig. 1). However, the precise role of the second O-acetyltransferase gene is not known.

**Polymerization and export genes.** The polysaccharide biosynthetic gene clusters studied thus far can be divided into two distinct classes depending upon whether an ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transporter gene pair is present. ABC transporters (16, 18, 72) are implicated in the export of group II capsules in *E. coli* (65, 79) and related capsules of *Neisseria meningitidis* (19) and *Haemophilus influenzae* (46), of the *S. enterica* Vi antigen (29), and of a class of O antigens which includes *E. coli* O9 (40), *Yersinia enterocolitica* O3 (91), and *Vibrio cholerae* O1 (52). A different mechanism of polysaccharide export is thought to operate in a second class of O antigens, of which the paradigm is the *S. enterica* group B O antigen (69, 88). Gene clusters for producing this second class of O antigen invariably have a gene (*wzx*, formerly *rfbX* [70]) encoding a predicted integral membrane protein with 12 transmembrane segments. *wzx* genes from different O-antigen gene clusters usually show little primary sequence similarity to one another (51, 69). It is thought that Wzx (RfbX) acts in O-unit export by flipping the Und-PP-O-unit from the cytoplasm into the periplasm (48), where polymerization occurs. The CA gene cluster does not have a pair of ABC transporter genes, and we suggest that CA may belong to a class of EPSs in which repeat unit assembly, export across the cytoplasmic membrane, and perhaps polymerization proceed in a manner analogous to that proposed for the Wzx-dependent class of O antigens. *orf17* (Fig. 2) is predicted to encode an integral inner membrane protein with 10 transmembrane segments and shows some sequence similarity (particularly in the amino-terminal region) to proteins encoded at other EPS gene clusters, as well as to Wzx (RfbX) proteins of O-antigen systems (Fig. 5). Although the degree of similarity between these proteins is very low (for example, Orf17 shows 22% identity and 51% similarity to RfbX of *Shigella flexneri* [51]), pairwise comparisons in which one of the sequences was randomly shuffled showed that this level of similarity is nevertheless higher than what is expected by chance alone. We propose that *orf17* fulfills a role analogous to that of the *wzx* genes of O-antigen systems; i.e., it is necessary for export of the E unit from the cytoplasm, and so we have called it *wzx*. By further analogy with Wzx-dependent O antigen biosynthetic systems, we expect the CA cluster to have a gene responsible for polymerization of the E units. The O antigen polymerases thus far identified are integral inner membrane proteins (14, 55), and it is reasonable to expect that the CA polymerase will have a similar form. We note that *wcaD*, one of the remaining unassigned *wca* ORFs, encodes a protein predicted to have nine transmembrane segments, and so a possible role for WcaD is CA polymerization. There is no sequence similarity between WcaD and any of the O antigen
