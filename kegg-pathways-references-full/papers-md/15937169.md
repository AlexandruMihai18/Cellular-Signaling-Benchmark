Bacteria exposed to transient host environments can elicit adaptive responses by triggering the differential expression of genes via two-component signal transduction systems. This study describes the *vicRK* signal transduction system in *Streptococcus mutans*. A *vicK* (putative histidine kinase) deletion mutant (*SmuvicK*) was isolated. However, a *vicR* (putative response regulator) null mutation was apparently lethal, since the only transformants isolated after attempted mutagenesis overexpressed all three genes in the *vicRKX* operon (*Smuvic*<sup>+</sup>). Compared with the wild-type UA159 strain, both mutants formed aberrant biofilms. Moreover, the *vicK* mutant biofilm formed in sucrose-supplemented medium was easily detachable relative to that of the parent. The rate of total dextran formation by this mutant was remarkably reduced compared to the wild type, whereas it was increased in *Smuvic*<sup>+</sup>. Based on real-time PCR, *Smuvic*<sup>+</sup> showed increased *gtfBCD*, *gbpB*, and *ftf* expression, while a recombinant VicR fusion protein was shown to bind the promoter regions of the *gtfB*, *gtfC*, and *ftf* genes. Also, transformation efficiency in the presence or absence of the *S. mutans* competence-stimulating peptide was altered for the *vic* mutants. In vivo studies conducted using *SmuvicK* in a specific-pathogen-free rat model resulted in significantly increased smooth-surface dental plaque (Pearson-Filon statistic [PF], <0.001). While the absence of *vicK* did not alter the incidence of caries, a significant reduction in *SmuvicK* CFU counts was observed in plaque samples relative to that of the parent (PF, <0.001). Taken together, these findings support involvement of the *vicRK* signal transduction system in regulating several important physiological processes in *S. mutans*.

Among the hundreds of bacterial species that colonize and persist in the oral cavity, *Streptococcus mutans* is among the few species that have been consistently linked with caries formation (31). Under the low-pH conditions that define the plaque environment, *S. mutans* induces an acid tolerance response that helps it survive (14, 15, 18). Hence, the ability to adapt to and generate acids at the tooth surface allows *S. mutans* to predominate within carious lesions by reducing the plaque pH to levels that are inhibitory to other oral microbes (34, 47). In addition, the ability of *S. mutans* to synthesize extracellular polysaccharides that promote formation of the plaque biofilm also contributes to its pathogenicity (35, 47). As a result, investigations to characterize virulence determinants of this oral pathogen have continued to dominate the caries microbiology field for decades.

Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSTS) are among the regulatory networks that are essential for bacterial adaptation, survival, and virulence. These systems function as “molecular switches” to modulate gene expression in response to changes in the external environment (44). Typically, signal transduction is accomplished via two regulatory elements consisting of a membrane-associated histidine kinase and a cytoplasmic response regulator. Upon exposure to an environmental cue, such as pH, osmolarity, or oxidation-reduction potential, the histidine kinase becomes autophosphorylated at a conserved histidine residue. Following the transfer of this phosphate group to a response regulator, the regulator can control the transcription of target genes by binding to their promoter regions. Diverse metabolic processes controlled by TCSTS include chemotaxis, sporulation, quorum sensing, and antibiotic/bacteriocin production in a wide variety of bacteria (3, 8, 30, 43, 45). Previous work conducted in one of our laboratories indicated that genetic competence, biofilm formation, and acid tolerance are mediated by detection of a signal peptide by the *comDE* TCSTS in *S. mutans* (27, 28). Genetic competence enables recipient bacteria to inherit heterologous genes that can contribute to the emergence of antibiotic resistance, as well as promote genetic variation that can drive overall fitness and evolution (7).

Analysis of the *S. mutans* UA159 genome database revealed 13 putative TCSTS and at least one independent response regulator (1, 21). The present study describes an investigation into the *S. mutans vicRK* signal transduction system that en-

codes a putative histidine kinase (VicK) and a response regulator (VicR) (Fig. 1A). This TCSTS in *S. mutans* was first described as *covRS* by Lee et al. (GenBank accession number AF393849), after its homolog in *Streptococcus pyogenes* (26). While this system does bear sequence similarity to the *covRS* system of *S. pyogenes*, it appears more closely related to the *vicRK* TCSTS of *S. pyogenes* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. To clarify this further, the *S. pyogenes covR* homolog in *S. mutans* was named *gcrR* by Sato et al. (40) and later renamed *tarC* following its characterization by Idone et al. (21). Figure 1B clarifies the relationship between various members of these TCSTS families. Based on these observations, it seems more appropriate to refer to this TCSTS as *vicRK* as previously named in the annotated *S. mutans* UA159 genome sequence available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) GenBank database (1). In this paper, we chose to henceforth refer to the TCSTS as *vicRK* in accordance with its designation by Ajdic et al. (1).

The *vicRK* TCSTS family is best characterized in *S. pneumoniae* and in *Bacillus subtilis* (10, 12, 20, 46). In a study conducted by Wagner et al., overexpression of the *vicK* gene in *S. pneumoniae* resulted in a mutant attenuated for virulence in a mouse model (46). Also, a *vicK* null mutant demonstrated a decrease in transformation efficiency (TE) relative to the wild type by approximately 3 orders of magnitude (46). Efforts to generate a deletion mutation in the *S. pneumoniae vicR* ho-

molog ($vicR$), however, proved unsuccessful. In contrast to the recent publication by Lee et al. (26), in this study we claim that $vicR$ inactivation in $S. mutans$ is also lethal. Herein we describe a link between $vicRK$ signal transduction and $S. mutans$ sucrose-dependent adhesion, biofilm formation, and competence development. We also report our assessment of the abilities of an $S. mutans$ $vicK$-deficient mutant to form plaque and generate caries in a specific-pathogen-free rat model.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Bacterial strains, plasmids, and media.** The bacterial strains, plasmids, and amplicons used in this study are listed in Table 1. The $S. mutans$ UA159 wild-type strain and its derivatives were routinely maintained on Todd-Hewitt yeast extract (THYE) agar (BBL Becton Dickinson, Cockeysville, MD) containing appropriate antibiotics when needed. Antibiotics used for the mutant strains were erythromycin (10 $\mu$g/ml), spectinomycin (1,200 $\mu$g/ml), kanamycin (500 $\mu$g/ml), and tetracycline (10 $\mu$g/ml). All $S. mutans$ cultures were routinely grown as standing cultures at 37°C in a 5% CO$_2$–95% air mixture.

**Construction of $S. mutans$ $vicRK$ mutants.** We searched the $S. mutans$ UA159 genome database (http://www.genome.ou.edu/smutans.html) for $vicR$ and $vicK$ homologs using the $S. pneumoniae$ RR02 and HK02 amino acid sequences as queries, respectively. To delete the $vicRK$ gene pair in $S. mutans$ UA159, we used a ligation-PCR mutagenesis strategy as previously described (25). The resulting putative histidine kinase mutant was termed SmuvicK, while repeated attempts to generate a $vicR$ null mutant in the NG8 and UA159 backgrounds proved to be futile. In the latter case, all recovered transformants overexpressed the $vicRKX$ genes and were hence designated Smuvic$^+$. The primers used for mutant construction and confirmation are listed in Table 2. Ligation constructs were introduced into $S. mutans$ by competence-stimulating peptide (CSP)-induced natural transformation (28), and transformants resistant to erythromycin were selected to confirm appropriate recombination into the chromosome by PCR, followed by nucleotide sequence analysis. The $vicRKX$ expression in the resulting mutants was monitored using quantitative real-time PCR (rtPCR) and compared with expression in the UA159 wild-type progenitor.

**Growth rates.** Growth kinetics were monitored using a Bioscreen microbiology reader (Bioscreen C Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland). Overnight cultures were diluted 20× in fresh THYE and grown to an optical density at 600 nm (OD$_{600}$) of approximately 0.4 to 0.5. Twenty microliters of mid-log-phase cells for the mutant and wild-type strains were inoculated in triplicate into microtiter plate wells containing 400 $\mu$l of THYE. Wells containing uninoculated THYE were used as controls. Using Biolink software (Labsystems), the Bioscreen reader was programmed to monitor OD$_{600}$s at 37°C every 20 min for 24 h, with moderate shaking every 3 min. OD$_{600}$ measurements were plotted against time to generate growth curves.

**$S. mutans$ biofilm formation.** A modified semidefined minimal medium (SDM) was prepared for biofilm growth experiments as described previously (29, 32). Biofilms were formed in 24-well polystyrene microtiter plates containing 2 ml of medium supplemented with 20 mM glucose or 10 mM sucrose. All wells were inoculated with 20 $\mu$l of an overnight cell suspension. In addition to SDM,

Competence assay. Overnight cultures of SmuvicK, Smuvic⁺, and their UA159 parent were diluted 20- or 40-fold in prewarmed THYE and incubated at 37°C until an OD₆₀₀ of approximately 0.3 was reached. Following the incubation period, 1 μg of closed circular plasmid DNA, pDL277, Specʳ (5), was added and the samples were divided into two aliquots, only one of which was supplemented with synthetic CSP (sCSP) (Hospital for Sick Children Biotechnology Services, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) at a final concentration of 750 ng/ml (28). To study genetic competence in the mutant and parent strains, we performed TE assays as described previously (28).

Examination of the *vicK* deficient strain, in vivo, for plaque formation and cariogenic potential. Specific-pathogen-free, caries-susceptible Osborne-Mendel rats (Center for Dental and Oral Medicine and Craniomaxillofacial Surgery, Zurich, Switzerland) were used to investigate in vivo effects of the *vicK* deletion on smooth-surface dental plaque and smooth and fissure caries, as well as on the establishment of *S. mutans* in the oral microbiota. Each experimental group consisted of 10 animals. Thirteen days after birth, the animals were transferred to stainless steel screen bottom cages without bedding and fed a finely ground stock diet (diet no. 3433; Provimi Kliba AG). Tap water and food were available ad libitum. On day 20 after birth, the dams were removed and the littermates distributed among the treatment groups (10 rats/group). On days 21 and 22, each rat was infected orally, twice daily, using 200 μl of a heavy bacterial suspension that comprised the parent UA159 strain or the *vicK* deletion mutant. To support the implantation of these bacteria, all rats received drinking water containing 2% sucrose and 2% glucose during days 20 to 22, as well as low-cariogenic diet 2000a (consisting of 28% skim milk, 15% powdered sucrose, 49% wheat flour, 5% brewer's yeast, 2% Gevral protein, and 1% sodium chloride). On day 23 following the association period, sterilization of the feeding and housing equipment was continued. Necessary precautions were taken to avoid cross-contamination and maintain a clean environment. Five days after association with the test strains, swabs were taken from the oral cavities of five rats per treatment group to confirm that the bacteria had become established. Shortly before the end of the study, oral swabs were taken from all 20 rats to obtain a final indication of the microbial status of the animals.

On day 51 (at the end of the 27-day experimental period), the animals were sacrificed. The upper and lower jaws were dissected and immersed in fixative (10% buffered formalin phosphate) for a minimum of 72 h. Erythrosin-stained maxillary molars were evaluated for plaque extent using a method described previously (39). Smooth-surface carious lesions were scored according to Keyes (22), and mandibular molars were sectioned and scored for fissure caries as specified by König et al. (24). The data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and least-significant-difference (LSD) tests using the analysis-of-variance statistics program.

Microbiological analyses of rat samples. The swabs taken from each animal were immersed in sterile test tubes containing phosphate-buffered saline and thoroughly shaken. An aliquot was used for culture analyses, and the remaining suspension was immediately frozen. Sample dilutions were plated onto Trypticase yeast Columbia blood (TYCB) agar using a spiral dilutor to obtain total floral counts. Dilutions were also plated onto Trypticase yeast agar supplemented with 20% sucrose and bacitracin to enumerate *S. mutans* bacteria. Both the parental and mutant strains were also plated onto TYCB agar containing 10 μg/ml erythromycin as a control for possible contamination.

**RESULTS**

Structural organization of the *S. mutans vicRKX* locus. The *S. mutans vicRKX* genes span a region of DNA from 1444056 to 1446908 bp (NCBI) on the minus strand of the *S. mutans* UA159 chromosome (Fig. 1A). The *vicK* coding sequence is 1,350 bp in size and encodes a putative histidine kinase sensor protein with a predicted mass of 51,686 Da (450 amino acids [aa]). A BlastP search revealed that VicK shares high similarity with the *S. pyogenes* VicK protein (NP_268803) and with a putative histidine kinase in *S. pneumoniae* (HK02, NP_358699). The *vicR* coding sequence is 705 bp in size and encodes a putative response regulator protein with a predicted molecular mass of 26,900 Da (235 aa). A BlastP search of VicR revealed that it shared high similarity with the *S. pyogenes* VicR protein (NP_268803.1) and with other response regulators in *S. agalactiae* (NP_687734) and *S. pneumoniae* (NP_606786.1). The *vicX* coding sequence is 801 bp

FIG. 2. *S. mutans* UA159 and Smuvic⁺ cDNAs were used to study expression of the *vicRKX* genes using quantitative rtPCR. For each strain, cDNA samples derived from three independent experiments were subjected to amplification using *vicRKX*-specific primers and *gyrA* primers (normalizing gene). For mutant and wild-type cDNAs, the n-fold increase in *vicRKX* expression was calculated relative to that of the UA159 parent, whose expression was set at user-defined value of 1.0.

in size and codes for a hypothetical protein with a predicted mass of 29,680 Da (267 aa). A BlastP search indicated that *S. mutans* VicX shares amino acid similarity with VicX in *S. pneumoniae* (NP_345691), VicX in *S. pyogenes* (NP_268804.1), and a metallo-β-lactamase superfamily protein in *S. agalactiae* (NP_687736).

Confirmation of the *S. mutans vic* mutants. To characterize the putative role of *vicR* and *vicK* in *S. mutans*, we constructed mutations within the *vicRK* coding sequences. The SmuvicK deletion mutation was confirmed by PCR analysis (results not shown). In contrast, we were unable to isolate a *vicR* null mutant. Sequence analysis of transformants revealed the presence of an intact *vicR* gene, as well as chromosomal integration of a VicR fragment that was used to mediate allelic exchange 5′ to the *vicRKX* operon (Table 1). Hence, instead of the expected double-crossover event, the presence of the intact *vicR* gene can be attributed to a Campbell-type crossover event mediated by the circularized a VicR fragment. To assess *vicRK*-specific expression in SmuvicK and Smuvic⁺ relative to the wild type, we performed rtPCR experiments, the results of which indicated no *vicK*-specific expression in the SmuvicK deletion mutant. rtPCR results for *vic* gene expression are shown in Fig. 2.

*vic* mutants have altered growth rates. Growth curve analysis of the SmuvicK and Smuvic⁺ strains revealed altered growth rates compared with that of the UA159 parent strain (Fig. 3). While an overnight culture of UA159 grew as a uniformly turbid cell suspension, SmuvicK and Smuvic⁺ cells aggregated and accumulated at the bottom of the glass tubes (Fig. 4). Notably, a denser cell aggregate was apparent for the SmuvicK mutant compared with that of Smuvic⁺. This observation was consistent with growth curves derived from each of three independent experiments that demonstrated a higher growth yield for SmuvicK during stationary phase compared with the wild-type and Smuvic⁺ strains (Fig. 3). While SmuvicK revealed little difference in the exponential-phase growth rate (mean [min/generation] ± standard error, 59.1 ± 2.6) relative to the wild type (50.1 ± 2), the doubling time of Smuvic⁺ was greatly increased (78.5 ± 1.5).

biofilms that were easily disrupted and only loosely adherent to polystyrene. As shown at the bottom of Fig. 5, relative to the wild-type strain, only a fraction of the SmuvicK cells attached to the surface. However, this easily dispersed phenotype was not apparent when SmuvicK biofilms were formed in glucose-supplemented medium (Fig. 5, top). Closer examination of the SmuvicK biofilm architecture derived from growth in SDM supplemented with glucose revealed areas of densely packed cells interspersed among “open” areas devoid of cells (Fig. 5, top). Notably, closer examination (×5,000 and ×50,000 magnifications) of SmuvicK biofilms derived from growth in diluted 0.25× THYE supplemented with sucrose revealed abnormally long chains of cells that were often detached at the cellular junctions. Compared with the wild type, these mutant cells were generally larger and seemingly associated with a rougher surface that we interpreted as thicker deposits of exopolymer (Fig. 5, bottom). In addition, the Smuvic⁺ biofilm also revealed aggregated cell clusters that were readily apparent at a magnification of ×1,000.

The *vic* genes affect *S. mutans gtfB*, *gtfC*, *gtfD*, *ftf*, and *gbpB* expression. Since SmuvicK biofilms grown in a sucrose-containing medium were altered in adherence compared with those grown in a medium supplemented with glucose, we hypothesized that the *vic* genes may influence *S. mutans* glucosyltransferase (*gtfB*, *gtfC*, and *gtfD*), fructosyltransferase (*ftf*), and/or *gbpB* expression. To test our hypothesis, we performed quantitative rtPCR using cDNAs derived from SmuvicK, Smuvic⁺, and UA159 and primers specific for the *gtfB*, *gtfC*, *gtfD*, *ftf*, and *gbpB* genes. Compared with the wild-type parent, the expression of all these genes was increased in the Smuvic⁺ mutant (Fig. 6). For example, the *gtf* genes were upregulated by more than fivefold in a medium supplemented with either glucose or sucrose (Fig. 6A), whereas *ftf* and *gbpB* expression was increased by nearly fourfold and twofold, respectively (Fig. 6B). In SmuvicK, relative to the wild type, expression of *gtfD* and *gbpB* was reduced, whereas *gtfC* expression remained unchanged (Fig. 6). Notably, in glucose-supplemented medium, expression of *gtfB* showed 3.7-fold more transcript relative to the parent strain.

VicR binds specifically to the promoter regions of *gtfB*, *gtfC*, and *ftf* in vitro. Overproduction of the VicR transcript in Smuvic⁺ and the concomitant upregulation of the *gtf* genes and *ftf* genes in this mutant suggested that VicR, like many response regulators, might act directly on the promoter regions for these genes. We therefore decided to examine VicR binding to the *gtfBC* and *ftf* promoter regions in vitro. We cloned the *vicR* coding sequence into an expression vector that allowed us to overexpress an amino-terminal MBP-VicR protein fusion. This construct was chosen since similar amino-terminal fusion constructs, like the CovR ortholog in *S. pyogenes*, were shown to bind indistinguishably from native CovR (11). The MBP-*S. mutans* VicR fusion was subsequently purified by >90% as revealed by Coomassie blue staining (data not shown) and used in electrophoretic mobility shift assays. As shown at the top of Fig. 7, MBP-VicR bound the DNA of the promoter regions of *gtfB*, *gtfC*, and *ftf* (MBP purified from the vector alone failed to shift the *gtfB* and *gtfC* promoter regions; data not shown). In electrophoretic mobility shift assay reaction mixtures containing MBP-VicR and *gtfC*, salmon sperm DNA was added in 100-fold excess by weight without diminu-

Although the apparent affinity of MBP-VicR was similar for the *ftf* and *gtfB* promoters, as judged by the proportion of DNA shifted, it was also clear that the shift of the *gtfB* promoter was more distinct and clearly visible, similar to the *ftf*

promoter-containing complex. This suggested a greater site specificity of binding. Although we have yet to ascertain the exact sequence that MBP-VicR recognizes, it is likely that there are conserved sequence determinants within the given regions of all three promoter elements.

The $ vic $ mutants affect extracellular polysaccharide formation. Since the biofilm architecture and adhesive properties are affected by mutagenesis of the $ vic $ genes, we sought to gain insight into the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides in SmuvicK, Smuvic$^+$, and their parent UA159 strain. Based on the results of three independent experiments, cell-free supernatants of SmuvicK cultures resulted in a negative value for the percentage increase in $^{14}$C incorporated into dextran, possibly the result of degradation or removal of the newly synthesized dextran during the methanol washes (Fig. 8). In contrast, the rate of extracellular polysaccharide formation by Smuvic$^+$ culture supernatants was increased relative to the wild type.

The $ vic $ mutants have altered transformation efficiencies. Genetic competence assays indicated that SmuvicK and Smuvic$^+$ have altered TE compared to the UA159 wild-type progenitor strain, thereby supporting a role for the $ vic $ gene products in competence development. In the absence of CSP, the TE of Smuvic$^+$ was reduced by approximately 100-fold compared with the wild type, whereas the SmuvicK TE was not remarkably different from that of the wild type (data not shown). While addition of sCSP markedly increased the transformability of the wild-type strain by nearly 1,000-fold, the TEs of SmuvicK and Smuvic$^+$ were only increased by approximately 20- and 88-fold, respectively (Fig. 9). In other words, the percent change in TE (with added CSP) decreased by 60-fold ($n = 5$) and 13-fold ($n = 3$) for SmuvicK and Smuvic$^+$, respectively.

SmuvicK is significantly increased in surface plaque formation and reduced in CFU count in vivo. Compared with the UA159 parent strain, SmuvicK was significantly increased in its ability to form smooth-surface plaque (PF, <0.001; Table 3) in a specific-pathogen-free rat model.

and smooth-surface caries lesions were not significantly altered in the $vicK$-deficient mutant compared with the parent (Table 3). Although growth of SmuvicK and UA159 in blood agar was significantly different at a confidence interval of 95%, there were no significant differences in the total number of CFU between these strains in samples derived from rats (Table 4). While there was no visible growth of the parent strain on TYCB plates supplemented with erythromycin, data collected from TYCB plates without erythromycin revealed a significant reduction in CFU counts for SmuvicK compared with the parent strain (PF, $<0.001$; Table 4).

## DISCUSSION

The aim of this study was to investigate the VicRK signal transduction system and its effects on various virulence attributes of $S$. mutans. Similar to its ortholog in $S$. pneumoniae, $S$. mutans VicR seems essential for the viability of this bacterium. Based on our findings, the $vic$ gene products appear to modulate adherence, biofilm formation, and genetic competence development in $S$. mutans. Notably, they regulate the expression of several virulence-associated genes affecting synthesis and adhesion to polysaccharides, including $gtfBCD$, $ftf$, and $gbpB$. Moreover, studies conducted utilizing the $vicK$-deficient mutant in specific-pathogen-free rats revealed a significant increase in smooth-surface plaque compared with the wild-type UA159 parent, whereas the incidence of dental caries was not affected.

The VicRK signal transduction system in $S$. mutans was recently mentioned in a study by Bhagwat et al. in which construction of a $vicR$ knockout mutant proved to be futile (4). We experienced the same outcome when repeated attempts to construct an $S$. mutans $vicR$ null mutation in the UA159 and NG8 wild-type strains resulted in loss of viability. Consistent with this finding is a report by Wagner et al. that indicated an inability to generate a deletion mutation in the $S$. pneumoniae $vicR$ ortholog (46). Yet, Lee et al. recently published a report claiming to have inactivated the $S$. mutans $vicR$ gene, called $covR$ in their paper (26). Upon obtaining this mutant and examining the cDNAs generated from its RNA pool using three different primer sets that flank the $vicR$ coding sequence, we noted transcription of the $vicR$ gene at levels that were comparable to that of the parent (results not shown). In fact, if one examines the predicted integration site in the report of Lee et al., it is evident that the map of the locus shows insertion of the mutagenic construct 5' proximal to the wild-type $covR$ ($vicR$) gene. During our attempted mutagenesis of $vicR$, we were unable to demonstrate that $vicR$ is absolutely required for viability. However, it is reasonable to assume that the $vicR$ gene plays a vital role that is essential for the survival of $S$. mutans under our laboratory conditions. Transformants obtained during the mutagenesis of $vicR$ showed overexpression of the $vicRKX$ genes likely resulting from a promoter duplication caused by a Campbell-type insertion of the circularized VicR fragment. In contrast, $S$. mutans viability was not affected when $vicK$ was disrupted. Hence, the phenotypic differences that we observed for SmuvicK and Smuvic$^+$, which include adherence, biofilm formation, and TE, can probably be attributed to their genotypic differences, although intercellular interactions involving cross talk between VicRKX and other signal transduction systems cannot be discounted.

The ability of $S$. mutans to colonize teeth is paramount to the initiation and progression of dental caries. Among the $S$. mutans surface-associated proteins that facilitate adherence and colonization are glucosyltransferases (GtfB, GtfC, and GtfD) and a fructosyltransferase (Ftf), which catalyze the cleavage of sucrose to synthesize extracellular glucan and fructan polymers, respectively (2, 16, 17, 19, 38, 41). GtfB and GtfC produce water-insoluble glucans, which function as adhesive molecules that anchor bacteria to the tooth pellicle (13, 36). Oral bacterial aggregation is also mediated by interactions between surface-associated glucan-binding proteins (Gbp) that adhere to glucans, thereby promoting plaque formation (33). Collectively, these enzymes serve an important role in the pathogenicity of $S$. mutans. For instance, rats harboring $S$. mutans $gtfBCD$- or $ftf$-deficient mutants proved to be hypocariogenic (6, 35, 41, 47). Also, systemic or mucosal immunization with GbpB was shown to induce protective immunity against dental

caries in rats, indicating that GbpB may be an important target for the development of caries vaccines (42). In this study, we analyzed biofilms formed by *vic* mutants using SEM and visual examination of biofilms grown in microtiter plates. In sucrose-supplemented medium, we noticed that biofilms formed using UA159 wild-type cells were thicker and firmly attached to the surface, in contrast to those developed in the presence of glucose. In contrast, SmuvicK biofilms that formed in the presence of sucrose as the sugar source were loosely attached to the abiotic surface and easily disrupted compared with those derived from a glucose-supplemented medium, as well as wild-type biofilms derived from glucose- or sucrose-containing medium. Therefore, our findings support *vicRK* as a regulator of sucrose-mediated adherence in *S. mutans*. We henceforth conducted quantitative rtPCR experiments to assess the expression of *gtfBCD*, *ftf*, and *gbpB* in SmuvicK and Smuvic<sup>+</sup> cells grown in glucose- and/or sucrose-containing medium. Our results indicated that *vicK* acts as a positive regulator of *ftf*, *gtfD*, and *gbpB* expression. In the presence of sucrose, increased expression of the *gtfBC* genes was observed only in the *vic*-overexpressing mutant. The down-regulation of the *ftf*, *gtfD*, and *gbpB* genes can possibly account for the easily detachable biofilm phenotype of the *vicK*-deficient mutant as a result of a reduction in its rate of total dextran formation. The EPS assay is indicative of the rate of formation of extracellular glucans and fructans produced by the activity of Gtf proteins and Ftf on sucrose but does not, however, differentiate between soluble and insoluble polymers. Repeated measurements of the rate of dextran formation in SmuvicK resulted in negative values. It is possible that the type of dextran formed by this mutant is degraded or easily disturbed and removed during the methanol washes in the EPS assay protocol. In their publication, Lee et al. reported that CovR (*VicR*) negatively regulated glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing carbohydrate production (26). Although the CovR (*VicR*) mutant described by Lee et al. produced a *covR* transcript, their complementation studies conducted by supplying the mutant with multiple copies of the gene on a plasmid affected the proportion of glucose- and glucuronic acid-containing EPS, suggesting a relationship between this TCSTS and the type and proportion of EPS produced by *S. mutans*.

Since studying oral bacteria in their natural mode of growth (biofilms) is of enormous significance to understanding pathogenic mechanisms, we sought to gain insight into the contribution of the *vic* genes in the formation of *S. mutans* biofilms. Relative to biofilms formed by the UA159 wild-type parent strain, the mutant biofilms showed altered architecture as judged by visual inspection of biofilms on microtiter plates and by SEM. Specifically, compared with wild-type biofilms that appeared smooth and composed of uniformly distributed streptococcal chains and intracellular spaces, mutant biofilms seemed to clump and to form cellular aggregates. SmuvicK biofilms demonstrated the highest variability, with cellular aggregates emerging from relatively large open areas devoid of cells. Some of the streptococcal chains appeared “curly” (Fig. 5, top), the likely result of aberrant cell division or abnormal carbohydrate polymer deposition at the cell surface. Its chains were unusually long and seemed disconnected at the cell junctions (Fig. 5, bottom), probably contributing to their easily disruptable biofilm phenotype. Similar to SmuvicK, Smuvic<sup>+</sup>

exhibited cell aggregates that projected outward in the shape of circular mounds from an otherwise evenly distributed biofilm architecture. Recently, Ng et al. demonstrated that the VicRK TCSTS in *S. pneumoniae* positively regulates expression of PcsB (37). PcsB acts as a cell wall hydrolase, and downregulation of PcsB results in defects in cell separation, synthesis, and morphology (37). Interestingly, the PcsB homolog in *S. mutans* is GbpB, which is positively regulated by the *vic* genes. Hence, if *gbpB* in *S. mutans* serves a similar function, the long streptococcal chains that seemed disconnected at cell junctions in the *vicK*-deficient mutant may be possibly caused by the down-regulation of *gbpB* in this mutant. Additional studies are warranted not only to understand the role of the *vicR* and *vicX* genes in regulating the expression of *gbpB* in *S. mutans* but also to define the role of *gbpB* as a cell wall hydrolase in *S. mutans*.

In reference to VicR, the results of the in vitro binding studies supported the interaction of MBP-VicR with the promoters of *gtfB*, *gtfC*, and *ftf*. While we were able to demonstrate VicR specificity for these regions, we have yet to identify the specific DNA sequences to which VicR binds. Dubrac and Msadek have described a consensus that accommodates our hierarchy of binding (9). In addition to providing a consensus consisting of a conserved hexamer separated by five nonspecific nucleotides, they demonstrated that at extremely high concentrations, the VicR homolog of *Staphylococcus aureus* can even bind to a single hexamer. According to our model, each conserved hexamer is recognized by a single VicR monomer and hence binding at a site with properly spaced hexamers, like *gtfC*, actually occurs as a homodimer. In the case of the *ftf* promoter sequence, we would argue that the active species is actually a dimer of dimers. Since the hexamers are in direct repeat with the first T’s 11 bp apart, it is possible to have cooperative interactions and hence oligomerization, which has been observed for NtrC (48). Since TCSTS response regulators are typically regulated by their cognate histidine kinase, future experiments will need to examine the role of the phosphorylation state of VicR in DNA binding. We do not know the state of phosphorylation of the MBP-VicR fusion protein, nor do we know the effects of the presence of the amino-terminal fusion protein. This leaves us with a conundrum, as the consensus sequences actually overlap the promoters themselves. Since we have seen stimulation of *gtfB*, *gtfC*, and *ftf* transcription in the VicR overproducer, it stands to reason that transcription is enhanced by VicR binding to these promoters. Although the mechanism is unclear, there is a precedent. Lantibiotics are often self-regulated through a TCSTS quorum-sensing system. According to the model, as the lantibiotic concentration increases extracellularly, it binds to its cognate histidine kinase, resulting in phosphorylation of its partnered response regulator. Similar to our observations, the putative response regulator binding sites overlap the promoter regions of select genes just upstream of the –10 region (23). The specifics of this mechanism are unknown but clearly common among bacteria. Future experiments will focus on finer biochemical analysis of the VicR DNA binding interactions, including footprinting experiments that should identify the binding site.

In accordance with SmuvicK aberrant biofilm formation is the variant smooth-surface dental plaque content and CFU count noted for this mutant in vivo relative to the wild type.

However, despite an increase in smooth-surface plaque, SmuvicK was not hypercariogenic in a specific-pathogen-free animal model relative to the wild type. One possibility is that the SmuvicK biofilm was easily disrupted, thereby reducing the virulence potential usually associated with increased smooth-surface plaque. Supporting this argument is the diminished SmuvicK viable count observed for this mutant on TYCB agar that was supplemented with bacitracin. Alternatively, one might speculate that the SmuvicK adherence defect was masked in vivo by the presence of other oral microbes that could have “nonspecifically” coaggregated with the mutant, anchoring it to the tooth surface. It is important to note that the main factors that affect cariogenicity include the microbial composition, the diet, and the nature of the polysaccharide matrix, which determines the diffusion properties of plaque. Hence, in reference to polymer production in SmuvicK, excess plaque extent or volume would not necessarily result in hypercariogenicity. Among other phenotypes observed for the vic mutants were alterations in genetic competence development in the presence or absence of CSP. The results of our experiments indicate that the efficiency with which S. mutans can take up foreign DNA is indeed affected by the products of the vic genes. In the absence of CSP, we observed that the TE for Smuvic⁺ was decreased by approximately 100-fold compared with the parent strain, whereas the TE was not necessarily altered in SmuvicK. The addition of CSP failed to increase the TE of either mutant to levels observed for the wild-type cells (Fig. 9). Previously, we described a comCDE quorum-sensing system in S. mutans that induces genetic competence (28). The comCDE genes encode the precursor CSP (ComC), its sensor protein (ComD), and a cognate response regulator (ComE). The absence of any one of these genes compromises TE. The reliance of the comCDE system on SmuvicK to restore the CSP-dependent wild-type TE levels suggests that the S. mutans vicK-initiated signal transduction system has a distinct regulatory effect on the competence development pathway. Although it is possible that VicK might act as a receptor for CSP in addition to ComD, this needs to be examined directly to test this assumption.

In summary, this work provides significant insight into important regulatory functions of the vicRK signal transduction system in S. mutans. However, more studies are warranted to define the downstream target genes that are regulated by this signaling pathway and the vicX gene. Deciphering the molecular mechanism(s) that underlies the vicRK signaling system in this oral pathogen can foster our understanding of virulence gene regulation in S. mutans and so reveal novel targets for therapeutics directed against S. mutans cariogenicity.
