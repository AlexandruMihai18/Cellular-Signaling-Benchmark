CONTROL OF GUT DIFFERENTIATION AND INTESTINAL-TYPE GASTRIC CARCINOGENESIS

Yasuhito Yuasa

Gastric cancer is one of the world's most common cancers. Its carcinogenic pathway is mainly associated with *Helicobacter pylori* infection, subsequent inflammation and tissue regeneration. During the regeneration process, cells deviate from the normal pathway of gastric differentiation to an 'intestinal phenotype', which is thought to be precancerous and associated with the intestinal type of gastric cancer. Inappropriate activation of intestine-specific transcription factors could contribute to the occurrence of the intestinal-type cancer of the stomach.

ENDODERM  
The endoderm becomes the innermost layer of the embryo and produces the gut tube and its associated organs, including the liver and lungs.

SPLANCHNIC MESODERM  
The mesoderm becomes sandwiched between the ectoderm and endoderm of the embryo. It generates the blood, heart, kidney, gonads, bones and connective tissues. The splanchnic mesoderm is the area of mesoderm closest to the endoderm.

Gastric cancer is the second most frequent cause of death from cancer in both sexes in the world¹. The precise mechanism that underlies gastric carcinogenesis is not yet fully understood. However, several environmental factors, such as *Helicobacter pylori* infection, excessive intake of salt, and low intake of vegetables and fruit, have been linked with gastric carcinogenesis²⁻⁴. Gastric carcinomas can be divided into two distinct histological groups — the intestinal and diffuse types⁵ (FIG. 1). 'Intestinal-type' carcinomas are thought to be derived from gastric mucosa cells. They are histologically differentiated — meaning that they are characterized by well-defined glandular structures — have an expanding growth pattern and develop through well-characterized sequential stages. These stages are chronic gastritis, atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and dysplasia — an atypical change in the epithelium that is considered to be precancerous⁶. On the other hand, the 'diffuse type' is histologically undifferentiated. These tumour cells proliferate as single cells or in small clumps, have a diffuse infiltrative growth pattern, and tumours develop through a shorter, less well-characterized sequence of events from gastric epithelial cells (BOX 1).

Research has indicated an association between developmental pathways and gastric carcinogenesis⁷. Inappropriate activation of specific developmental pathways is likely to be involved in the development of intestinal metaplasia and intestinal-type gastric carcinomas — that is, gastric epithelial cells also deviate from their normal differentiation pathways towards an intestinal phenotype.

Overview of gut development and related genes  
The gut consists of the epithelium, derived from the ENDODERM, and connective tissue and smooth muscle, derived from the SPANCHNIC MESODERM. The mechanisms that underlie the formation of the gut have been investigated using mouse, chick, frog and fish embryos. Development of the gut is well conserved in vertebrates and occurs in three stages: formation of the gut tube, regionalization of the gut tube, and morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation⁸.

In mouse and chicken embryos, the gut tube is formed from a crescent-shaped fold, the so-called anterior-intestinal portal, which appears in the endoderm at the anterior tip of the embryo when somitogenesis begins and then moves posteriorly. A similar fold, called the caudal-intestinal portal, arises later at the posterior end of the embryo and moves anteriorly. The two folds meet at the yolk stalk, resulting in formation of the gut tube. The transcription factor Gata4 and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) have been reported to be involved in this stage in mice⁹⁻¹¹, but the precise mechanism has not yet been clarified.

After formation of the gut tube, cross-talk between the endoderm and mesoderm specifies gut regions.

Summary

- Gastric cancer is histologically classified into two main types — intestinal and diffuse.
- The carcinogenic pathway of intestinal-type gastric carcinomas is believed to begin with *Helicobacter pylori* infection, followed by chronic gastritis, atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia.
- Much has been learned recently about the transcriptional control of gut differentiation. Inappropriate activation of the intestine-specific transcription factor CDX2 is one of the most likely contributing factors in the induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach.
- Intestinal metaplasia has been observed not only in the stomach, but also in other digestive organs such as the oesophagus, biliary tracts and gallbladder — possibly as a consequence of inflammatory lesions and regeneration.
- Several genetic changes have been identified in intestinal-type gastric cancer. These include APC mutations and defects in the MLH1/microsatellite instability pathway, although these defects are only rarely observed. Mutation and/or loss of TP53 have been detected in more than half of the intestinal-type gastric cancers. However, the mechanisms that underlie most cases of this type of cancer remain to be determined.

SOMITOGENESIS  
Formation of somites — paired blocks of mesoderm bracketing the neural tube that arise by segmentation of the paraxial mesoderm at all levels from the anterior hindbrain to the caudal (tail) region.

Regionalization of the endoderm depends on the character of the overlying mesoderm. Several *HOX GENES* are expressed in a collinear manner along the length of the lateral-plate mesodermal component of the gut during development (FIG. 2), although there are some differences in the expression patterns between the mouse and chick<sup>8,12,13</sup>. These *Hox* genes are logical candidates to control the endodermal pattern in vertebrates, as there is abundant evidence that they provide positional information along the anterior–posterior axis in other germ layers. It has been reported that sonic-hedgehog (*Shh*) expression in the hindgut endoderm of the chick induces *Bmp4* expression in the adjacent mesoderm, which induces posterior *Hoxd13* expression in the mesoderm, thereby moving the adjacent endoderm posteriorly<sup>14,15</sup>.

Another homeobox gene complex, the ParaHox cluster, contains *CDX1*, *CDX2* and *PDX1*, which are expressed in the gut endoderm and are involved in the anterior–posterior patterning<sup>16,17</sup> (FIG. 2). *CDX2* expression starts in the proximal intestine and decreases posteriorly, whereas *CDX1* expression starts in the distal intestine, and they overlap in the midgut. *Cdx2*<sup>-/-</sup> mouse embryos die at implantation and heterozygotes show an anterior homeotic shift involving the axial skeleton<sup>18</sup>. Importantly, *Cdx2*<sup>+/-</sup> mice have multiple polyp-like lesions in the intestine, which contain histologically normal gastric mucosa, indicating an anterior homeotic shift<sup>19</sup>. *CDX2* is expressed before expression of most *HOX* genes, and *CDX2* upregulates *HOXA9* in cultured human colon cancer cells<sup>20</sup>. Also, Cdx proteins transduce *Hoxb8* expression in mice<sup>21</sup>, indicating that *Cdx2* is a posterior determinant. On the other hand, *Cdx1*<sup>+/−</sup> mice are normal, whereas homozygotes show an anterior homeotic shift involving the axial skeleton but no gut abnormalities<sup>22</sup>. *PDX1* expression is seen in the GASTRIC ANTRUM and the proximal part of the small intestine — the duodenum — as well as in the pancreas<sup>17</sup>. *Pdx1*-null mice develop pancreatic and duodenal abnormalities<sup>17,23</sup>. So, *PDX1* might be important for the development of the pancreas and regions including the antrum and duodenum.

WNT signalling regulates cell-fate decisions and cell proliferation during development and in adult tissues, including the gut. Each of the WNT signalling components shows a characteristic and region-specific expression pattern along the anterior–posterior axis of the digestive tube during embryonic development<sup>24,25</sup>, indicating that WNT signalling is involved in patterning of the gut. Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) 4, which is expressed in the posterior region of the embryo, induces the expression of NeuroD1 and the hormone somatostatin in the mouse endoderm in a concentration-dependent manner, also implicating it as a posterior morphogen<sup>26</sup>.

Transcripts of *Sox2*, a Sry-like high-mobility group (HMG) gene, appear before the commencement of morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation in the chicken rostral-gut epithelium from the pharynx to the stomach<sup>27</sup>. In chicken and man, the caudal limit (towards the tail or posterior part of the body) of SOX2 expression coincides with the rostral limit (towards the beak or head part of the body) of CDX1/2 expression — that is to say, SOX2 expression ends at the posterior end of the stomach and CDX1/2 expression starts from the anterior end of the duodenum, and both these borders are in contact (FIG. 2) (REF. 27 and Y. Y. *et al.*, unpublished observations). The roles of SOX2 and other relevant factors in the mechanism that underlies regionalization of the anterior gut are still not clear.

Figure 1 | Models of the gastric carcinogenic pathway. Gastric cancer has been histologically classified into two main types: the intestinal and diffuse types. Defects in E-cadherin function are specifically associated with diffuse-type gastric cancer (BOX 1), which possibly develops through a shorter, unidentified sequence of events from gastric epithelial cells. On the other hand, the carcinogenic pathway of intestinal-type gastric carcinomas seems to be more complicated, but involves well-characterized sequential stages. *H. pylori* infection induces a transition from normal mucosa to chronic superficial gastritis, which then leads to atrophic gastritis. As a consequence of inflammation and regeneration, the gastric mucosa can undergo intestinal metaplasia. Inappropriate activation of intestine-specific *CDX2* is one of the most likely candidates linked with the induction of intestinal metaplasia. *APC/β-catenin* mutations can induce formation of gastric adenomas and the intestinal-type gastric cancers (adenoma–carcinoma sequence), although the frequency of this conversion is low. Another set of genetic changes, such as methylation of the *MLH1* promoter, microsatellite instability and *TGF-β* type II receptor (*TGF-βRII*) gene mutations, have been associated with a small subset of intestinal-type gastric cancers. *TP53* alterations could be involved in development of both intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancers. At present, the mechanisms that underlie most dysplasias and intestinal-type gastric cancers have not been clarified. (-) indicates no expression of protein; (+) indicates expression of protein; (- ~ +) indicates no or low expression of protein.

Box 1 | The carcinogenic pathway of diffuse-type gastric cancer

The diffuse type of gastric cancer has been specifically associated with defects in E-cadherin function. Somatic mutations, loss and methylation of the *E-cadherin* gene are frequently observed in diffuse-type gastric cancer cells ${ }^{95,96}$, and germline mutations of *E-cadherin* have been identified in patients with hereditary diffuse gastric carcinomas ${ }^{97}$. E-cadherin is a calcium-dependent cell-adhesion molecule that maintains the epithelial phenotype in adult epithelial tissues, as well as during embryonic development ${ }^{98}$. Through its $\beta$-catenin-binding site, E-cadherin is believed to regulate cell proliferation. Its expression is downregulated in a number of carcinomas, and has been associated with invasion and metastasis. As patients with a germline mutation in *E-cadherin* exclusively develop diffuse-type gastric carcinomas, E-cadherin might be specifically involved in gastric epithelial-cell differentiation.

After formation of the gut tube and regionalization, morphogenesis occurs, fixing the fate of the tissue. This complex stage involves variations in proliferation, cyto-differentiation, cell death, cell adhesion and mobility. As for proliferation of intestinal cells, *Cdx1* is expressed in the crypts of the mouse intestine ${ }^{16}$, where proliferating cells are located. Expression of the epidermal growth factor receptor (Egfr) is required for intestinal epithelial-cell proliferation ${ }^{28}$ and the mesenchymal transcription factor Nkx2.3 controls cell proliferation in the midgut epithelium ${ }^{29}$, indicating that Cdx1, Egfr and Nkx2.3 could be associated with intestinal-cell proliferation. Several transcription factors upregulate tissue-specific protein expression and are supposed to induce terminal differentiation. In the stomach, pepsinogen — a precursor of the acid protease pepsin — is upregulated by Gata5 but downregulated by Sox2 in the chicken embryo ${ }^{30}$. Gata4/6 transcriptionally activates the $H,K-ATPase$ gene in culture ${ }^{31}$. GENETIC MOSAIC ANALYSIS also reveals that Gata4 is required for normal differentiation of mouse gastric epithelium ${ }^{32}$. PDX1 is related to the expression of endocrine cell-specific hormones, such as gastrin ${ }^{33}$. CDX2 upregulates many intestine-specific factors, such as sucrase/isomaltase, lactase/phlorizin hydrolase, carbonic anhydrase I, intestine-specific mucin MUC2 and liver intestine-cadherin ${ }^{34-36}$. Downstream targets of Notch signalling, Hes1 and Math1, are essential for the function of intestinal secretory cells and the upregulation of intestine-specific hormones in the mouse ${ }^{37,38}$. However, more factors must be involved in the gut development, such as transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), hepatocyte nuclear factors (HNFs), PAX4/6 and FKH6, as the developing gut tube expresses a wide variety of transcriptional regulators that could contribute to the cellular complexity of the gut.

**Helicobacter pylori**

*H. pylori* colonizes the human stomach and persists for several decades. It is estimated to infect at least half of the world’s population, chronic infection causing gastric diseases such as chronic atrophic gastritis and peptic ulcers. Moreover, epidemiological and other studies have indicated that *H. pylori* is involved in the development of gastric adenocarcinomas and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas ${ }^{3}$. Although *H. pylori* infection seems to significantly increase the risk of developing both intestinal and diffuse gastric adenocarcinomas ${ }^{4}$, the mechanisms responsible for the development of intestinal-type cancer are better known. During the development of intestinal-type gastric cancer, *H. pylori* colonization leads to superficial gastritis, chronic atrophic gastritis and intestinal metaplasia and, finally, to dysplasia and adenocarcinomas ${ }^{3}$ (FIG. 1).

In developed countries, *H. pylori* probably increases the risk of developing gastric cancer by six fold ${ }^{39}$, but most *H. pylori* carriers never develop gastric cancer. Therefore, the cancer risk is thought to be associated with *H. pylori* strain differences, inflammatory responses governed by host genetics, and specific interactions between host and microbial determinants. Several genetic loci, such as the *cag* island, and the *vacA* and *babA2* genes, have been identified as bacterial factors ${ }^{3}$. The *cag* island is the most important virulence factor of *H. pylori* strains. Following *H. pylori* adherence to epithelial cells, the bacterial type-IV secretion system, encoded by the *cag* island genes, translocates the CagA protein from *H. pylori* into the cells, where it undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation. The phosphorylated CagA specifically binds cellular SHP2 phosphatase and triggers phosphatase activity, thereby inducing a morphological change of the cells ${ }^{40}$. As the treatment of cells with growth factors, such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), induces a similar morphological change, *cagA*-positive *H. pylori* seems to trigger a growth-factor-like response.

**HOX GENES**

Transcription factors that are characterized by a 60-aminoacid domain (the homeodomain) that binds to certain regions of DNA and controls regional specification along the anterior-posterior axis. Mouse and human genomes contain four copies (a–d) of the HOX complex located on four different chromosomes. The equivalent genes in each complex are called a paralogous group.

**GASTRIC ANTRUM**

The distal third of the stomach.

**GENETIC MOSAIC ANALYSIS**

To analyse spatial complexity of differentiation, chimeric mice are produced by injection of genetically manipulated embryonic stem cells (for example, Gata4 ${ }^{-/-}$) into ROSA26 blastocysts bearing a ubiquitously expressed $\beta$-galactosidase transgene.

Figure 2 | Regional expression of transcription factors in the developing gut. The transcription factors shown on the right have been mapped to specific regions of the endoderm, as shown on the left. There is a presumed rule of expression patterns of HOX genes in the developing gut. Each subdomain of the developing digestive tract (foregut, midgut and hindgut) seems to have a different HOX code ${ }^{8,12,13}$. CDX2 expression starts in the proximal intestine and decreases (lightening bar) posteriorly, whereas CDX1 expression starts in the distal intestine and decreases anteriorly ${ }^{16}$. PDX1 expression has been observed in the antrum and duodenum ${ }^{17}$. SOX2 is expressed from the pharynx to the stomach ${ }^{27}$.

The inflammatory response induced by *H. pylori* leads to the release of free radicals, such as reactive oxide species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen oxide species (RNOS). These free radicals can induce a number of alterations, including gene mutations and post-transcriptional modifications of key cancer-related proteins. These alterations can lead to the disruption of cellular processes such as DNA repair, cell-cycle checkpoints and apoptosis.

Several human DNA polymorphisms, as well as bacterial genetic elements, have also been associated with the gastric diseases that are induced by *H. pylori*. Most of these polymorphisms occur within immune-response genes. Expression of the cytokine interleukin (IL)-1β is increased within the gastric mucosa of individuals positive for *H. pylori*, and several polymorphisms affecting protein expression have been identified in the IL-1β gene-promoter region. Individuals who are colonized by *H. pylori*, and who possess promoter-region polymorphisms associated with higher-than-average expression levels of IL-1β, are at a significantly increased risk of developing HYPOCHLORHYDRIA, gastric atrophy and distal gastric adenocarcinomas than individuals with polymorphisms that are linked to lower expression levels of IL-1β.

Development of intestinal metaplasia  
Chronic atrophic gastritis and associated intestinal metaplasia are the most common precursor conditions for gastric carcinomas—particularly for cancers of the intestinal type. Intestinal metaplasia is characterized by the transdifferentiation of gastric epithelial cells to an intestinal phenotype, accompanied by the expression of intestine-specific genes, including MUC2, sucrase/isomaltase and carbonic anhydrase I. Intestinal metaplasia of the stomach is divided into two types: the complete and incomplete types. The complete type of intestinal metaplasia is characterized by the presence of absorptive cells, PANETH CELLS and GOBLET CELLS (corresponding to the small intestine phenotype), whereas the incomplete type is characterized by the presence of columnar and goblet cells but not Paneth cells (corresponding to the large intestine phenotype). Importantly, the incomplete type of intestinal metaplasia is more commonly associated with an increased risk of malignant transformation than is the complete type. Although the genetic events responsible for aberrations in differentiation have not been well clarified, several candidate genes, most of which are involved in gut development, have been found to be associated with intestinal metaplasia in humans and mice (TABLE 1).

The homeoprotein CDX2 is one of the most likely candidates to be involved in the induction of intestinal metaplasia of the stomach. CDX2 is a *Drosophila caudal*-related homeobox transcription factor that is important for the early differentiation and maintenance of intestinal epithelial cells. CDX2 activates transcription of intestine-specific proteins, such as MUC2, sucrase/isomaltase and carbonic anhydrase I (REFS 34,35) (FIG. 3). CDX2 also upregulates WAF1 (also known as p21 and

SHH is a polarizing signal protein that is involved in the morphogenesis of many organs, including the gut<sup>49</sup>. Shh-null mice develop intestinal transformation (metaplasia) of the stomach<sup>50</sup>. In humans, SHH is expressed in the FUNDIC GLAND of the stomach, but not in metaplastic intestinal cells<sup>51</sup>. Even though SHH cannot directly induce the intestinal phenotype, it might suppress intestine-specific transcription factors. So, loss of SHH expression could facilitate the development of intestinal metaplasia. It has, however, been reported that the developmental alterations observed in Shh-null mice do not correlate with changes in the expression of some genes that have been implicated in regulation of anterior-posterior patterning in the gut, including CDX2 (REF. 50).

**Neurogenin-3** is a basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor that is involved in the differentiation of enteroendocrine cells. Neurogenin-3-null mice have also been reported to develop intestinal metaplasia, as well as to have defects in the development of gastric endocrine cells<sup>52</sup>. Whether neurogenin-3 is associated with intestinal metaplasia formation in humans remains to be evaluated.

The trefoil-factor gene family, comprising pS2 (TFF1), spasmolytic polypeptide (SP or TFF2) and intestinal-trefoil factor (ITF or TFF3), encodes small, abundant, acid-stable secreted proteins of the gastrointestinal epithelium, which are strongly induced after mucosal injury<sup>53</sup>. Ulcers in the antrum can be induced in rats by application of serosal acetic acid, causing increased expression levels of ITF and SP in ulcer margins after 4 days. Seven months after injury, gastric atrophy, intestinal metaplasia and severe dysplasia with conserved ITF expression were seen. ITF was also induced in human intestinal metaplasia and conserved in gastric cancers, whereas expression of gastric peptide pS2 progressively decreased with progression from metaplasia to dysplasia<sup>53</sup>. Given that alterations in trefoil-factor expression were observed much earlier than the appearance of typical intestinal metaplasia in rats, these trefoil factors — particularly ITF — might be involved in the early stages of intestinal metaplasia formation<sup>53</sup>. However, it is necessary to determine whether or not CDX2 expression is also induced in the ulcer margins as early as the trefoil factors, and whether or not CDX2 can upregulate ITF expression.

### Development of intestinal-type gastric cancer

The mechanisms underlying intestinal-type gastric carcinomas seem to be complicated, but follow well-characterized sequential stages (FIG. 1). *H. pylori* infection induces a transition from normal mucosa to chronic-superficial gastritis, which then leads to atrophic gastritis. As a consequence of inflammation and regeneration, the gastric mucosa can develop intestinal metaplasia — possibly because the intestinal character is a developmental default state in the stomach. Ectopic CDX2 expression is one of the most likely contributing factors in the induction of intestinal metaplasia, as discussed above.

Micewith heterozygous disruption in Cdx2 develop many colonic polyps, indicating the tumour-suppressive activity of Cdx2 (REF. 18). Furthermore, CDX2 overexpression inhibits the growth and/or promotes the differentiation of colorectal cancer cells<sup>54</sup> or undifferentiated intestinal epithelial cells in culture<sup>55</sup>. CDX2 is expressed at higher levels in intestinal-type than diffuse-type cancers<sup>44</sup>. Therefore, CDX2 is important for the maintenance of differentiation as well as its tumour-suppressive activity. Cory Abate-Shen has proposed the term ‘tumour modulators’ for some homeobox genes, rather than tumour-suppressor genes or oncogenes<sup>7</sup>. This is because genes such as CDX2 are highly expressed in intestinal metaplastic cells of the stomach, as well as in normal colorectal epithelial cells, but can be downregulated in cancer cells<sup>44,56,57</sup>.

If CDX2-expressing cells become malignant, they become intestinal-type gastric adenocarcinomas. As cancer cells increase their expression of CDX2, the histology of the cancer becomes more differentiated. However, cancer cells inevitably become less differentiated during progression, resulting in the downregulation of CDX2. Methylation of the CDX2 gene promoter might be responsible for this reduction. Overall, even though the role of CDX2 in carcinogenesis has not been clarified, it is one of the key factors that is associated with intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis.

Unlike CDX2, CDX1 has pro-oncogenic potential. Cdx1-null mice do not seem to develop tumours<sup>22</sup>, indicating that its gene product does not have tumour-suppressive activity. Cdx1 overexpression stimulates the proliferation of cultured intestinal epithelial cells<sup>58</sup>, and Cdx1 is upregulated following oncogenic activation of the Ras and Wnt/β-catenin pathways in cultured cells<sup>59,60</sup>. These data indicate that there are differences between CDX2 and CDX1 in the regulation of cell growth as well as in transcriptional activity, as described above. However, there have been conflicting reports about the function of CDX1. It has been reported that CDX1 inhibits the proliferation of cultured intestinal epithelial cells through downregulation of D-type cyclin<sup>61</sup>. It is important to gain more insight into the role of CDX1 and the reasons that CDX1 expression is also decreased, like CDX2, in human intestinal-type gastric and colorectal cancers.

Several Hox genes are expressed in the gut and are important for its development (FIG. 2). There have been no reports, however, of altered Hox expression patterns during intestinal metaplasia or cancer of the stomach. One reason for this might be functional redundancy of the Hox genes. It has been reported that at least 30% of cases of the incomplete-type intestinal metaplasia show genetic alterations, such as TP53 mutations, microsatellite instability, promoter hypermethylation and reduced telomere length<sup>62</sup>. This supports the idea that intestinal metaplasia — particularly the incomplete type — might already include the precursor lesions that lead to gastric cancer.

APC mutations are frequently found in gastric adenomas<sup>63</sup>, and have been associated with intestinal-type gastric cancer (adenoma–carcinoma sequence) as well as colorectal carcinoma<sup>64</sup>. However, the frequency of APC mutations in gastric cancers is low, indicating that they might be associated with only a small subset of gastric cancers<sup>63,65,66</sup>. Mutational loss of APC function activates the WNT/TCF signalling pathway by stabilizing β-catenin, which activates oncogenic target genes<sup>67</sup>. Stabilization of β-catenin also results from mutations of β-catenin itself, although the mutation frequency of this gene is not high (0–16%) in gastric cancers<sup>63,68</sup>. The mutation frequency of the KRAS gene, which might be related to adenoma progression, is also low in gastric cancers<sup>63</sup>.

TGF-β is a multifunctional cytokine that has profound regulatory effects on many developmental and physiological processes<sup>69</sup>. In Tgfβ1-null mice, gastric epithelial proliferation is stimulated and epithelial hyperplasia occurs, indicating that TGF-β could regulate gut development<sup>70</sup>. Although named originally for its ability to induce a transformed phenotype in cultured cells, TGF-β and its signalling pathway are often involved in suppressing cell growth. Human gastric cancer cell lines frequently show resistance to the normal inhibitory effects of TGF-β, and the development of TGF-β resistance represents a significant step in the process of gastric carcinogenesis<sup>71</sup>. In these resistant cells, genetic changes in the TGF-β type II receptor (RII) gene have often been identified. The most frequent change is seen in the polydeoxyadenine tract of the gene<sup>72</sup>. Interestingly, this change is highly associated with microsatellite instability, which could be induced by decreased expression of the DNA mismatch-repair gene MLH1, caused by promoter methylation<sup>72</sup>. These changes have been associated with a small subset (about 10%) of gastric cancers<sup>73–75</sup> as well as colorectal cancers<sup>76,77</sup>.

RUNX3/PEBP2αC is a runt-domain transcription factor and is an important target of TGF-β superfamily signalling. Recently, it has been reported that Runx3-null mice commonly develop hyperplasia of the gastric mucosa, owing to stimulated proliferation and suppressed apoptosis in epithelial cells<sup>78</sup>. These cells are resistant to the growth-inhibitory and apoptosis-inducing actions of TGF-β, indicating that Runx3 is an important growth regulator of gastric epithelial cells. Between 45% and 60% of human gastric cancer cells do not significantly express RUNX3, owing to hemizygous deletion and hypermethylation of the RUNX3 promoter region<sup>78</sup>.

Mutations and/or loss of TP53 have been detected in more than half of the intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancers, and are likely to be an important factor in tumorigenesis<sup>79,80</sup>. Other genetic changes reported in intestinal-type gastric cancers include amplification of the ERBB2 and cyclin E genes, as well as increased telomerase activity<sup>62</sup>. It is generally thought that carcinogenesis occurs through a multistep process — this is also true for gastric cancer. Further analysis of gut development-related factors, including GATA factors, PDX1 and SOX2, are necessary to better understand intestinal-type gastric carcinogenesis.

Figure 4 | Causes of intestinal metaplasia and related cancers in digestive organs.  
Inflammation, intestinal metaplasia and adenocarcinomas arise in different digestive organs  
with various causes. In the biliary tract, cholangiocarcinoma has been associated with liver-  
fluke infection, hepatolithiasis and choedochal cyst formation. In the gallbladder, carcinomas  
arise due to cholelithiasis, cholecystitis and infections with various *Helicobacter* species.  
Oesophageal adenocarcinoma has been associated with gastro-oesophageal reflux  
disease (GERD), whereas gastric adenocarcinoma is associated with *H. pylori* infection and  
resulting gastritis.  

Intestinal metaplasia in other digestive organs  
The stomach is not the only organ that undergoes  
intestinal metaplasia (FIG. 4). Intestinal metaplasia is also  
frequently observed in patients with BARRETT'S OESOPHAGUS.  
Barrett’s oesophagus is usually induced by gastro-  
oesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and considered to be  
a precancerous state of oesophageal adenocarcinomas<sup>81</sup>.  
It is noteworthy that chronic acid exposure leads to acti-  
vation of the *Cdx2* gene in long-term cultures of mouse  
oesophageal keratinocytes<sup>82</sup>.  

The biliary tract shows signs of intestinal metaplasia  
after inflammatory events, such as liver-fluke infection,  
HEPATOLITHIASIS and choledochal cysts, often resulting in  
cholangiocarcinomas<sup>83</sup>. Liver-fluke (*Opisthorchis viverrini*) infection is endemic and cholangiocarcinomas are  
very common in northeastern Thailand<sup>84</sup>. CHOLELITHIASIS  
is also associated with intestinal metaplasia and carcino-  
mas of the gallbladder<sup>85</sup>. *Helicobacter* species such as  
*H. bilis* and *H. pullorum* have been proposed as possible  
causes of biliary-tract diseases, ranging from chronic  
cholecystitis to gallbladder carcinomas, acting in a simi-  
lar manner to *H. pylori* in the stomach<sup>86</sup>. So, intestinal  
metaplasia is not limited to the stomach, but rather is  
common in the digestive organs, as a consequence of  

BARRETT'S OESOPHAGUS  
The normal squamous  
oesophageal epithelium is  
replaced by columnar  
epithelium during the process of  
healing after repetitive injury to  
the oesophageal mucosa.  

HEPATOLITHIASIS  
Formation of calculi in the  
intrahepatic biliary tract. It  
frequently occurs in association  
with bacterial infection of the  
biliary tract or bile stasis. Most of  
these stones are made of calcium  
bilirubinate.

calculi are made of cholesterol.  

inflammatory lesions and regeneration, and exists as a  
precancerous state.  

As in the stomach, the reason for the appearance  
of intestinal metaplasia in several digestive organs  
could be that the intestinal character is a develop-  
mental default state in these organs. It will be impor-  
tant to determine if *CDX2* expression is altered in the  
intestinal metaplasia that develops in these organs.  
Recently, aberrant expression of *CDX2* was reported  
in Barrett’s oesophageal epithelium<sup>87</sup>.  

Future directions  
It is important to elucidate the upstream pathways that  
regulate developmental determinants such as *CDX2* and  
*CDX1*. Interestingly, *CDX2*, but not *CDX1*, is a target of  
PTEN/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase signalling and  
tumour necrosis factor-α signalling, via NF-κB-depen-  
dent pathways<sup>88</sup>. On the other hand, *CDX1*, but not  
*CDX2*, is targeted by WNT/β-catenin/TCF signalling<sup>60</sup>.  
Moreover, oncogenic RAS downregulates *CDX2* through  
activation of the protein kinase C pathway, whereas  
*CDX1* is upregulated by oncogenic RAS<sup>59</sup>. These results  
indicate that *CDX2* and *CDX1* specifically respond to  
distinct regulatory pathways. Moreover, *CDX2* is a  
potent inhibitor of the basal and β-catenin-stimulated  
activity of the *CDX1* promoter<sup>89</sup>. Further investigations  
are necessary to fully understand the regulatory mecha-  
nism of *CDX2/1* expression, and the potential cross-talk  
between these signalling pathways.  

Approaches for preventing gastric cancer have been  
proposed that involve elimination of *H. pylori* infec-  
tion, although there is still disagreement as to the  
reversibility of precancerous lesions such as intestinal  
metaplasia. Some investigators have found regression of  
cancer precursor lesions after eradication of *H. pylori*.  
For example, a randomized, controlled chemopreven-  
tion trial showed that effective anti-*H. pylori* treatment  
and dietary supplementation with antioxidant  
micronutrients can interfere with the precancerous  
process<sup>90</sup>. This approach induced regression of cancer  
precursor lesions, such as atrophy and/or intestinal  
metaplasia, and could be an effective strategy for pre-  
venting the development of gastric carcinomas in  
humans. On the other hand, some researchers have  
reported that curing of *H. pylori* infection does not  
effect the growth of cancer precursor lesions<sup>91</sup>.  
Interestingly, *CDX2* expression in intestinal metaplasia  
did not disappear after eradication of *H. pylori*<sup>91</sup>.  

Moreover, there are major drawbacks to eliminating  
*H. pylori* infections<sup>3</sup>. The falling incidences of *H. pylori*  
infection and gastric cancer in developed countries  
over the past century have been accompanied by a  
rapidly-increasing incidence of GERD. This disease is  
the strongest known risk factor for developing Barrett’s  
oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinomas. On the  
other hand, in geographical regions of the world where  
most people are colonized by *H. pylori* — and therefore  
have reduced acid production — GERD, Barrett’s  
oesophagus and oesophageal adenocarcinomas are  
uncommon. So, we are in a dilemma regarding the two  
types of disease.

Dietary factors are also important determinants of cancer risk, including gastric cancer². Certain dietary factors are associated with variations in DNA methylation, and these variations might underlie gastric carcinogenesis. For example, methylation of *CDKN2A* (which encodes p16) is associated with tobacco smoking and non-small-cell lung cancer⁹². Consequently, *CDKN2A* expression is silenced, resulting in the progression of carcinogenesis.

*CDX2* expression is lower in gastric cancers than in intestinal metaplasia cells, and its expression was found to be inhibited by promoter methylation in gastric cancer cell lines. A comparison of *CDX2* methylation status and the lifestyle of patients with gastric cancer indicated that the methylation frequency was inversely correlated with the intake of vegetables (*Y.Y. et al.*, unpublished observations). This is consistent with the epidemiological preventive effect of vegetables on gastric cancer. So, diet could be an important factor determining the methylation levels of genes such as *CDX2* and in the resultant aberrant differentiation of gastric epithelial cells.

Induction of differentiation is therefore one possible therapeutic approach for gastric cancer. For example, all-*trans* retinoic acid can induce complete remission in patients with acute promyelocytic leukaemia by inducing differentiation of leukaemic cells⁹³. If *CDX2* expression could be regained, intestinal-type gastric cancer cells might be able to differentiate and stop proliferating. This could be accomplished through treatment with demethylating agents, such as an aza-nucleotide analogue⁹⁴, which would retrigger the expression of genes such as *CDX2*.

Given that *CDX2* promoter methylation is affected by diet, cancer prevention might also be possible through increased vegetable intake. Naturally, the best end point of such therapeutic interventions would be restoration of a normal gastric mucosa. Further studies are therefore required to identify the factors that regulate normal gastric epithelial-cell differentiation — not only for clarification of the mechanisms that underlie normal gastric development, but also for the development of therapeutic interventions. The field of transcriptional control of gut differentiation and carcinogenesis is focused on both of these challenges.
