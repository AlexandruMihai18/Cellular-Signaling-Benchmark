# The different faces of Notch in T-helper-cell differentiation

**Derk Amsen**, **Andrey Antov** and **Richard A. Flavell**

**Abstract** | Interleukin-12 (IL-12) and IL-4 induce Thelper 1 ($\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1)- and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell differentiation, respectively, *in vitro*. However, not all $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-cell responses require IL-12 *in vivo*, and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses are remarkably independent of IL-4-receptor signalling, suggesting that other polarizing signals must exist. Accumulating evidence indicates that Notch is a candidate receptor that might mediate these signals. However, contrasting roles for Notch have been proposed: some evidence shows that Notch promotes $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-cell differentiation, whereas other evidence supports a prominent role for Notch in $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell differentiation. In this Review, we discuss recent findings that help to reconcile this discrepancy and highlight the accumulating evidence for the role of Notch in T-cell-mediated diseases.

### $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cell
A type of CD4+ T helper ($\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$) cell that produces interleukin-17 (IL-17) and that is thought to be important in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The generation of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells involves IL-6 and transforming growth factor-$\beta$, as well as the transcription factors ROR$\gamma$T (retinoic-acid-receptor-related orphan receptor-$\gamma$) and STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3).

Adaptive immune responses are directed by at least three different types of effector CD4+ Thelper ($\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$) cell, known as the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2- and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$17-cell lineages${}^{1}$, each of which orchestrates the immune response to particular classes of microorganisms through the production of distinct cytokines. For example, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1 cells produce interferon-$\gamma$ (IFN$\gamma$) to stimulate the clearance of intracellular infections${}^{2}$, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2 cells produce interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5 and IL-13 to promote the elimination of helminth infections${}^{2}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$17 cells produce IL-17, which leads to the recruitment of neutrophilic granulocytes and may promote the elimination of extracellular bacteria${}^{1}$. In addition to promoting immunity, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$-cell subsets can also mediate pathological responses: $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1- and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$17-cell responses can cause autoimmunity${}^{3}$, and excessive $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses are involved in allergic reactions${}^{2}$. The differentiation of the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$-cell subsets that are required to protect the host from an infectious agent is directed by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which translate their recognition of specific microbial features into signals that instruct the differentiation of naive CD4+ precursor T cells${}^{4}$.

The high efficiency with which $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1- and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell differentiation can be induced *in vitro* by IL-12 and IL-4, respectively, has led to the widespread belief that these cytokines are the main inducers of these $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$-cell subsets. However, many $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1- and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses *in vivo* are partially or completely independent of these cytokines. Although certain $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-cell responses *in vivo* are reduced in the absence of IL-12 or of components of the IL-12 receptor (IL-12R) signalling pathway, such responses are never completely abrogated${}^{5-8}$. It has been argued that the primary function of this cytokine is not to induce $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-cell differentiation, but instead to select cells that are already committed to the $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-cell lineage and enhance their effector function${}^{6,9,10}$. For example, the number of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1 cells that developed following immunization with soluble extract from *Toxoplasma gondii* tachyzoites was almost as high in the absence as in the presence of IL-12, although the production of IFN$\gamma$ was markedly reduced in the absence of IL-12 (REF. 9). Some $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1-cell responses are entirely independent of IL-12, including those that cause diabetes in non-obese diabetic mice${}^{11}$ and those that are generated in response to some viruses, such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus and mouse hepatitis virus${}^{12-14}$.

Similarly, although some $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses are decreased in mice that lack components of the IL-4R signalling pathway${}^{15,16}$, $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell differentiation *in vivo* is mostly independent of IL-4. For example, the absolute numbers of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2 cells that are generated following infection with helminths are similar in wild-type mice and mice that are deficient for signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6; an essential transcription factor for IL-4R signalling)${}^{9,17-20}$. IL-4-independent $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses are also mounted to other types of antigen${}^{17}$, with the most potent inducers of $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses being the least dependent on IL-4. IL-4 might function mainly to amplify $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses and might be necessary when other signals that drive $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell differentiation are limiting.

The finding that $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$1- and $\mathrm{T}_{\mathrm{H}}$2-cell responses can be generated in the absence of IL-12 and IL-4, respectively, suggests that there are other factors that can instruct

T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation. As APCs can only induce T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation in *cis*<sup>21</sup>, it is probable that such signals are membrane bound rather than secreted. In this Review, we discuss evidence suggesting that the Notch pathway can provide these signals. We review studies that have investigated how Notch instructs T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation during normal and pathological immune responses (focusing on T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses; for possible roles of Notch in other lineages see BOX 1) and highlight recent insights into the signalling mechanisms and transcriptional events that are involved in this process. In addition, we attempt to explain the paradoxical capacity of Notch to instruct both the T<sub>H</sub>1- and the opposing T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation programme.

### A short background on Notch

Notch is a heterodimeric cell-surface receptor that is involved in a broad range of differentiation processes<sup>22</sup>. It is composed of an extracellular ligand-binding domain that is non-covalently associated with a single-pass transmembrane domain. In the canonical signalling pathway (FIG. 1), binding of a ligand to Notch results in the cleavage of the receptor at a site in the transmembrane portion. This cleavage is mediated by a γ-secretase complex, of which the presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 proteins are crucial components; inhibitors of this complex are frequently used to experimentally inhibit Notch activation<sup>22</sup>. The cleavage of Notch results in the release of its intracellular domain from the plasma membrane and its subsequent translocation to the nucleus, where it associates with the DNA-binding factor recombination-signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin-κ J region (RBPJ; also known as CBF1 and CSL) and the co-activator Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1)<sup>22</sup>. This tri-molecular complex recruits additional co-activators, including chromatin-modifying enzymes, to activate the transcription of Notch target genes<sup>22</sup>. Constructs that only encode the intracellular Notch domain are constitutively active and have been used extensively to mimic Notch signalling<sup>23</sup>.

There are four mammalian Notch proteins (Notch1–Notch4), all of which are expressed by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>24,25</sup> and use the canonical signalling pathway that involves RBPJ<sup>26</sup>. However, as each Notch protein may have specific target gene preferences, their function may differ<sup>27</sup>. There are two distinct families of Notch ligands in mammals, known as the Delta-like ligands (consisting of DLL1, DLL3 and DLL4) and the Jagged ligands (Jagged1 and Jagged2); both DLL and Jagged proteins trigger the canonical Notch signalling pathway<sup>28</sup>. Although unique functions for each ligand have been described<sup>25,29–31</sup>, the underlying mechanisms for these differences are unclear. Regulation of Notch ligand function is complex and occurs at many levels<sup>32</sup>. One regulatory mechanism involves the Fringe family of glycosyl transferases, which mediate the glycosylation of the extracellular portion of Notch proteins and thereby inhibit binding to Jagged ligands and promote binding to DLL proteins. For a more extensive overview of the Notch pathway we refer the reader to REFS 22,32.

### Notch in T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation

DLL proteins. As mentioned above, Notch proteins are thought to have a role in the induction of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses; this is supported by the finding that the induction of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation by APCs correlates

**Box1 | An immunosuppressive role for Notch**

In addition to influencing T helper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1)- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation, there is evidence to suggest that Notch has immunosuppressive functions. Overexpression of the Notch ligand Jagged1 in a B-cell line induced the differentiation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with suppressive activity in vitro<sup>76,77</sup>. In addition, dendritic cells that overexpressed Jagged1 induced T-cell tolerance *in vivo* that could be transferred to wild-type mice when the T cells were adoptively transferred<sup>78</sup>. Moreover, endogenous expression of Jagged2 by haematopoietic progenitor cells favoured the expansion of regulatory T (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells *in vivo*<sup>79</sup>. Exposure of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to Delta-like ligand (DLL) proteins under strong T<sub>H</sub>1-cell-polarizing conditions led to high levels of interleukin-10 (IL-10) production<sup>80</sup>, which may serve to limit collateral tissue damage during inflammation<sup>81,82</sup>. The induction of IL-10 production by Notch probably also explains the means by which a transgene that encodes intracellular Notch3 could prevent the induction of experimental diabetes<sup>71</sup>.

Some studies indicate that Notch can directly inhibit T-cell proliferation<sup>83,84</sup>, although other studies found that Notch is necessary for optimal T-cell activation<sup>24,85</sup>. One factor that may be involved in determining the activating or inhibitory functions of Notch may be transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ). Intracellular Notch and SMAD3 (mothers against decapentaplegic homologue 3; a transcription factor that is activated by TGFβ) have been found to interact<sup>86</sup>, which might affect the target gene specificity of Notch. In addition, γ-secretase inhibitors diminished the inhibition of naive T-cell proliferation by T<sub>Reg</sub> cells that expressed membrane-bound TGFβ (REF. 84), and a blocking antibody specific for TGFβ impaired the ability of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells to prevent allergic airway responses<sup>84</sup>. In another study, the presence of soluble TGFβ promoted Notch-dependent expression of the T<sub>Reg</sub>-cell-specifying transcription factor forkhead box P3 (FOXP3), which is thought to result in the generation or maintenance of adaptive T<sub>Reg</sub> cells<sup>87</sup>.

The potential importance of Notch in immunosuppression is supported by the development of autoimmune symptoms in mice that have reduced expression of presenilin, an essential component of the γ-secretase complex, or in mice that are treated with γ-secretase inhibitors<sup>87,88</sup>. The reason why mice that lack combinations of Notch proteins or the DNA-binding factor recombination-signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin-κ J region (RBPJ) do not develop a similar autoimmune pathology is unclear. One possible explanation might be that Notch is required for both effector T-cell and T<sub>Reg</sub>-cell responses. Therefore, the complete absence of Notch signalling (for example, in knockout mice) may prevent both the immunosuppression and the autoreactive response, whereas partial inhibition (for example, in mice that have reduced expression of presenilin or in mice that have been treated with γ-secretase inhibitors) may prevent the immunosuppressive, but not the autoreactive function of Notch.
with APC expression of DLL proteins. The expression of DLL proteins by dendritic cells (DCs) is induced by several stimuli, including infection with respiratory syncytial virus, exposure to bacteria such as *Acinetobacter lwofii* and *Lactococcus lactis* and exposure to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands lipopolysaccharide and CpG-containing DNA. These stimuli have also been found to promote the DC-mediated induction of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>5,33–37</sup>. Furthermore, exposure to a combination of TLR ligands synergistically increases the expression of DLL4 by DCs as well as their capacity to induce T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>33</sup>. Deficiency for the adaptor protein myeloid differentiation primary-response gene 88 (MyD88)

precludes the induction of DLL expression by DCs and abrogates their ability to induce T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses (both IL-12 dependent and independent)<sup>9,25,35,36</sup>.

Most gain-of-function studies show that DLL proteins indeed promote the differentiation of naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into the T<sub>H</sub>1-cell lineage. More specifically, cross-linking of Notch with a DLL1–Fc fusion protein stimulated T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses *in vitro*<sup>38</sup> and *in vivo*<sup>38–40</sup>. In addition, ectopic expression of DLL1 or DLL4 by artificial APCs or bone-marrow-derived DCs promoted T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>25,34,36</sup>. Finally, several groups have reported that the expression of intracellular Notch1 or Notch3 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells resulted in T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>38,41,42</sup>.

Several studies in which the Notch pathway was inhibited confirmed that this pathway is essential for certain T<sub>H</sub>1-cell functions. T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses were reduced *in vivo* following the administration of blocking DLL–Fc fusion proteins<sup>34,38</sup> or of a neutralizing antibody that was specific for DLL1 (REF. 39). Furthermore, one study showed that γ-secretase inhibitors (which prevent the activation of the Notch signalling pathway) blocked IL-12-induced T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation *in vitro*<sup>41</sup>. By contrast, deficiency for RBPJ, for both Notch1 and Notch2 or for both presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 did not affect T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>25,42,43</sup>. This suggests that targets of γ-secretase inhibitors other than Notch<sup>44</sup> may control IL-12-induced T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation. Indeed, recent evidence indicates that Notch is mainly required for T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation in conditions in which IL-12 is absent or available at low levels. For example, one study showed that IL-12-dependent T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses to *Leishmania major* were not affected by the expression of a dominant-negative MAML1 transgene, which blocks RBPJ-dependent Notch signalling<sup>45</sup>. Furthermore, a blocking DLL4–Fc fusion protein could not inhibit IL-12-dependent T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>34</sup>. However, this fusion protein did block T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation that was induced by splenic CD8α<sup>−</sup> DCs, which express DLL4 and not IL-12, but not differentiation that was induced by CD8α<sup>+</sup> splenic DCs, which express IL-12 and not DLL4 (REF. 34).

So, the available evidence favours a role for DLL proteins in promoting some T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses. However, experiments using Notch knockout mice have not confirmed whether Notch is required for T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>25,42,45</sup>. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that the effect of DLL proteins might involve another receptor that has yet to be identified.

Notch-mediated activation of *Tbx21*. The molecular mechanisms by which Notch mediates T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation (FIG. 2) are not well understood. Indeed, it is unclear which Notch proteins mediate T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation and whether the canonical signalling pathway that involves RBPJ or a separate signalling pathway underlies this process. In support of an RBPJ-dependent mechanism of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation, one report showed that Notch may directly activate the transcription of *Tbx21* (REF. 41), the gene that encodes

Figure 1 | The canonical Notch signalling pathway. Notch is expressed on the cell surface as a heterodimer that consists of an extracellular ligand-binding domain that is non-covalently associated with a transmembrane polypeptide. Signalling is initiated by the interaction of Notch with Delta-like ligands (DLLs) or Jagged ligands on the surface of instructing cells. Following ligand binding, sequential cleavages occur in the transmembrane region of Notch, the first mediated by an ADAM (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase)-family protease and subsequently by a γ-secretase complex. This final cleavage results in the release of the Notch intracellular domain from the plasma membrane and its translocation to the nucleus, where it binds to recombination-signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin-κ J region (RBPJ) transcription factors that are bound to the promoters of Notch target genes. At these sites, intracellular Notch displaces co-repressors from RBPJ and recruits co-activators, including Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1), to activate the expression of target genes. The activity of intracellular Notch is terminated by its polyubiquitylation (Ub) and subsequent proteasomal degradation. Although degradation is depicted in the nucleus, the exact location where degradation occurs has not been established.

Figure 2 | The role of Notch in T-helper-1- and T-helper-2-cell differentiation. Thelper 1 (T<sub>H</sub>1)-cell-promoting microbial products induce the expression of Delta-like ligands (DLLs) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs), which in turn promote the capacity of the APCs to induce T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation (a). Intracellular Notch may cooperate with recombination-signal-binding protein for immunoglobulin-κ J region (RBPJ) and other cofactors, such as Mastermind-like 1 (MAML1), to induce T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation by activating the transcription of *Tbx21*, which encodes the T<sub>H</sub>1-cell-specifying transcription factor T-bet (b). In addition, intracellular Notch may promote the expression of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell-promoting genes in an RBPJ-independent manner through interaction with the nuclear factor-κB-family proteins p50 and p65 (c). Finally, DLL proteins inhibit interleukin-4 (IL-4)-induced T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation, thereby favouring T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation (d). T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-promoting microbial products, allergens and pro-inflammatory mediators induce the expression of Jagged ligands by APCs (e). The induction of T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation by Notch depends on RBPJ and involves the direct transactivation of the upstream Gata3 (GATA-binding protein 3) promoter (f) and of a 3′ enhancer in *Il4* known as HS5 (g).

the T<sub>H</sub>1-cell-specifying transcription factor T-bet. Retroviral expression of either intracellular Notch1 or Notch3 led to T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation in two studies and was associated with IL-12-independent expression of T-bet<sup>38,41</sup>. Although an effect of DLL on T-bet expression could not be documented, T-bet was found to be necessary for DLL-induced T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation<sup>36</sup>. Several potential RBPJ binding sites are present within 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site of the *Tbx21* gene, and both RBPJ and Notch1 could be immunoprecipitated with *Tbx21* chromatin regions that were isolated from a T-cell hybridoma<sup>41</sup>, although another group failed to detect such an association in primary T cells<sup>46</sup>. Whether *Tbx21* is indeed a direct target of Notch, and to what extent the initiation of *Tbx21* expression by Notch determines its ability to induce T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation, are questions that have yet to be fully addressed.

A connection between Notch and NF-κB. An additional mechanism by which Notch may promote T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation is through its connection with the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) pathway<sup>47</sup>. Notch proteins can activate the expression of NF-κB-family genes in various cell types<sup>48,49</sup> and can associate with and stimulate the IkB kinase complex, which activates NF-κB<sup>50–52</sup>. In addition, Notch can prolong the activity of NF-κB in T cells by promoting the nuclear retention of the NF-κB proteins p50 and p65 through direct protein–protein interactions<sup>53</sup>. Strikingly, despite the absence of consensus binding sites for RBPJ in the *Ifng* promoter, Notch was found to associate with this promoter, possibly by interacting with p50 and p65 (REF. 53). An interesting implication of this finding is that it indicates the possibility that Notch has an RBPJ-independent function, which is consistent with the finding that RBPJ was not required for T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation in some studies<sup>25,45</sup>. However,

it should be noted that the connection between NF-κB and T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation is tenuous<sup>54</sup>; some groups have shown that NF-κB promotes T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses, whereas others have found that it promotes T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses. This controversy may be due, in part, to the different strategies that were used to inhibit NF-κB in each study<sup>54</sup>. Interestingly, p50 was shown to be required for T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation and the induction of the expression of GATA-binding protein 3 (GATA3)<sup>55</sup>, which suggests that p50 may not have a decisive role in Notch-mediated T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation.

**Notch-mediated inhibition of T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation.** In contrast to evidence suggesting that Notch actively promotes T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation, it has also been proposed that Notch might achieve this indirectly by inhibiting T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>36</sup>. In one study, DLL1 or DLL4 were found to inhibit T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation that was induced by the administration of exogenous IL-4 *in vitro*. This inhibition did not depend on IFNγ or T-bet, although T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation that was induced by DLL1 or DLL4 did require these factors<sup>36</sup>. As the positive effect of DLL proteins on T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation was not greater than when blocking antibodies to IL-4 alone were added to the T-cell culture, it was concluded that DLL-induced Notch activation mainly inhibits IL-4R signalling, which allows the T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation programme to proceed in an IFNγ- and T-bet-dependent manner<sup>36</sup>.

**Jagged ligands.** The mechanism by which Notch is activated to promote T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses is not clear, although substantial evidence indicates that the expression of Jagged proteins by APCs may induce T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation. Members of the Jagged, but not the DLL, protein family are expressed by APCs under T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-inducing conditions. In particular, the expression of Jagged2 is induced in DCs in response to T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-promoting stimuli, including microbial products (such as Schistosoma mansoni egg antigen (SEA) and Vibrio cholerae toxin), allergens (such as dust-mite extract) or pro-inflammatory mediators (such as prostaglandin E2)<sup>25,59,60</sup>. T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-inducing immature human myeloid DCs constitutively express Jagged1, and this expression is reduced by signals that promote T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses<sup>61</sup>. Moreover, a TLR signalling pathway that is independent of the adaptor protein MyD88 (which is indispensable for the induction of T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses to soluble TLR ligands) increases the expression of mRNA encoding Jagged1 and promotes the capacity of DCs to induce T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>25,62,63</sup>.

In further support of a role for Jagged ligands in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation, ectopic expression of Jagged1 by artificial APCs resulted in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation *in vitro*<sup>25</sup>, and a stimulatory Jagged–Fc fusion protein promoted T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses in the mouse model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis<sup>39</sup>. The downregulation of Jagged1 expression by RNA interference diminished the induction of T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation by human immature myeloid DCs<sup>61</sup>, and Jagged2 deficiency reduced T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation by DCs that had been treated with SEA *in vitro*<sup>64</sup>. By contrast, downregulation of Jagged2 expression did not affect T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation in another study, and Jagged2-deficient T cells could still be induced to differentiate into T<sub>H</sub>2 cells by SEA-treated DCs *in vivo*<sup>59,64</sup>.

Despite these conflicting results, we still think that Jagged ligands can mediate the T<sub>H</sub>2-cell promoting function of Notch<sup>25,42,45,56</sup> as DLL proteins are not expressed by DCs under T<sub>H</sub>2-cell promoting conditions<sup>25,64</sup> and there is no evidence for physiological ligand-independent activation of Notch. Given that Jagged1 and Jagged2 might have a redundant function, the role of these Notch ligands in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation should be studied using mice that are deficient for both Jagged ligands in DCs. However, the issue is complicated by the possibility that other cell types which express Notch ligands might control T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation *in vivo*. Finally, it is possible that the induction of T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation is regulated by another, less well characterized family of Notch ligands, such as contactin 1 (also known as F3) and contactin 6 (also known as NB3)<sup>65,66</sup>.

**Notch in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation**

As discussed above, there is a substantial body of evidence that supports a role for Notch in T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation. However, there is arguably more persuasive evidence that supports a role for Notch in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation. Expression of any of the four intracellular Notch proteins in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells resulted in pronounced T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation in several studies<sup>25,42,46</sup>. Importantly, there is a lack of genetic evidence that supports the role of Notch in T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation, whereas its role in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation is strongly supported by such studies<sup>25,42,45,56</sup>. T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses to parasite antigens or to antigens adsorbed to aluminium hydroxide adjuvant were abrogated *in vivo* in the absence of RBPJ or in mice that expressed a dominant-negative form of the co-activator MAML1 (REFS 42,45,56). Although both RBPJ and MAML1 have functions that are independent of Notch<sup>57,58</sup>, T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses were also defective in the absence of both Notch1 and Notch2 (REF. 42) (but not either one alone), formally confirming the requirement for Notch in these responses. However, although Notch was required for T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses to parasite antigens, T cells that were deficient for both Notch1 and Notch2, for RBPJ or for both presenilin 1 and presenilin 2 differentiated normally into T<sub>H</sub>2 cells *in vitro* in the presence of high amounts of exogenous IL-4 (REFS 42,43,45). So, excess IL-4 can override the requirement of Notch ligation to generate T<sub>H</sub>2 cells *in vitro*. This discrepancy has been the root of some controversy regarding the requirement for Notch in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>41,43</sup>.

**Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis**

An experimental model for the human disease multiple sclerosis. Autoimmune disease is induced in experimental animals through immunization with peptides that are derived from myelin. The animals develop a paralytic disease owing to inflammation and demyelination in the brain and spinal cord.

**RNA interference**

A method of post-transcriptional control of gene expression, in which the introduction of small, sequence-specific, double-stranded RNAs into cells leads to the degradation of mRNAs that have a complementary sequence.

**Notch-mediated activation of IL-4 and GATA3 expression.**

The finding that T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses depend on RBPJ<sup>25,56</sup> suggests that Notch mediates this process by directly transactivating T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-promoting target genes. Two crucial genes, *Il4* and *Gata3*, have indeed been identified as Notch and RBPJ targets. A 3′enhancer of *Il4* (known as HS5 and CNS2) contains several RBPJ-binding sites, one of which is conserved between mice and humans; this suggests that it is functionally important<sup>25</sup>.

Chromatin immunoprecipitation studies showed that endogenous Notch1 and RBPJ bind to HS5 in CD4⁺ T cells⁴⁶, and responsiveness of this enhancer to Notch *in vivo* has been shown by two independent studies²⁵,⁶⁷. Furthermore, activation of HS5 by intracellular Notch was abrogated by the introduction of point mutations in the RBPJ-binding sites in HS5, thereby strongly suggesting that Notch directly transactivates this enhancer²⁵. Expression of a reporter transgene under the control of HS5 was inhibited in RBPJ-deficient mice⁶⁷, which indicates that endogenous Notch signalling is required for the regulation of IL-4 expression by this enhancer. The finding that IL-4 expression is downstream of Notch signalling explains, at least in part, why exogenous IL-4 can override the requirement for Notch in Tₕ₂-cell differentiation²⁵,⁴¹, which has been a matter of controversy²⁵,⁴¹⁻⁴³.

Notch-mediated regulation of Gata3 has also been investigated. Gata3 transcription is increased in response to IL-4R signalling⁶⁸. However, Notch can efficiently induce Tₕ₂-cell differentiation even in STAT6-deficient T cells (in which signalling pathways downstream of IL-4R are disabled) through a mechanism that depends on GATA3 (REFS 42,46). This suggests that GATA3 might be regulated by Notch in a STAT6-independent manner. Indeed, levels of Gata3 mRNA are markedly increased by intracellular Notch in STAT6-deficient T cells⁴²,⁴⁶. The two Gata3 promoters, which are positioned 10 kb apart, each drives the expression of a unique non-coding first exon, which becomes spliced to a common second exon⁶⁹. The most upstream Gata3 promoter contains an RBPJ-binding site (which is conserved between mice and humans) and strongly activates the expression of GATA3 in response to Notch signalling⁴²,⁴⁶. Endogenous RBPJ and Notch1 were shown to bind to this site in the upstream Gata3 promoter, which supports a physiological role for these molecules in the regulation of GATA3 expression⁴²,⁴⁶.

Interestingly, GATA3 and Notch synergize to promote Tₕ₂-cell differentiation⁴⁶. Given the proximity of potential GATA3- and RBPJ-binding sites in the regulatory regions of both Gata3 and Il4, Notch and GATA3 might be recruited to these binding sites in a cooperative manner by associating with each other. Alternatively, it is possible that these molecules cooperate in the recruitment of co-activators or that chromatin modifications carried out by one factor facilitate the function of the other. For example, chromatin remodelling of Il4 by GATA3 may be necessary for optimal transactivation of Il4 by Notch. Conversely, Notch may affect the chromatin structure of Gata3 (REF. 46), making it more responsive to other factors, including GATA3 itself⁶⁸.

The results of studies so far support a model in which the activation of Notch induces IL-4-independent Tₕ₂-cell responses, such as those that are elicited by helminth infections⁹,¹⁷⁻²⁰. This is mediated by Notch at least in part through the induction of GATA3 expression, which in turn facilitates the progression of the Tₕ₂-cell differentiation programme, partly by supporting remodelling of the Tₕ₂-cytokine locus (FIG. 2). Initial GATA3 expression then further increases its own transcription in a feed-forward mechanism, resulting in the stabilization of the Tₕ₂-cell phenotype⁶⁸. Autocrine and/or paracrine production of IL-4 in response to Notch may provide further signals that amplify differentiation into the Tₕ₂-cell lineage, which may be especially important when an exogenous source of IL-4 is not available. It is possible that there are additional targets of Notch that remain to be identified. Furthermore, Notch might also function at a later stage of Tₕ-cell differentiation, for example, by maintaining a stable Tₕ₂-cell phenotype or by promoting effector function. Consistent with this hypothesis, the Notch-responsive Il4 enhancer HS5 was found to be most active in memory T cells⁷⁰. Finally, Notch may promote Tₕ₂-cell responses by regulating the production of IL-4 by a poorly defined subset of CD4⁺ T cells that have a memory phenotype (and are presumably distinct from effector memory T cells) and natural killer T cells⁶⁷.

### How does Notch decide: Tₕ₁ or Tₕ₂ cells?

What determines whether Notch instructs Tₕ₁- or Tₕ₂-cell differentiation is currently unclear. One of the most puzzling aspects of this field is that, when similar experimental approaches were used to express intracellular Notch³⁸,⁴¹, some groups reported Tₕ₁-cell differentiation³⁸,⁴¹, whereas others reported Tₕ₂-cell differentiation²⁵,⁴²,⁴⁶,⁷¹. Variables such as the expression levels of intracellular Notch and the influence of (unidentified) co-signals may modify cellular responses to Notch signalling and lead to discrepant results. A key element that might determine the cellular response to Notch signalling may be whether GATA3 is expressed, as the absence of GATA3 caused Notch to induce Tₕ₁- rather than Tₕ₂-cell differentiation in one study⁴². Therefore, conditions that favour or prevent the expression of this crucial Tₕ₂-cell-promoting transcription factor might determine the outcome of Notch signalling on Tₕ-cell differentiation. The idea that co-signals that have yet to be identified are involved may explain why the ectopic expression of DLL or Jagged proteins by chinese hamster ovary cells failed to induce Tₕ-cell differentiation in one study⁴³, which is in contrast to several other studies in which these ligands were found to have a role in this process²⁵,³⁴,³⁶,³⁸⁻⁴⁰.

Another confusing issue is the ability of the different types of Notch ligand to induce distinct cellular responses through the same receptors. One possible explanation is that the different ligands might trigger qualitatively different signalling by Notch. Thus, although induction of Tₕ₂-cell differentiation depends on the canonical RBPJ-dependent Notch signalling pathway, the induction of Tₕ₁-cell differentiation by Notch may be mediated by a non-canonical pathway that does not involve RBPJ²⁵,⁴¹,⁴²,⁴⁵,⁵⁶. However, it should be noted that the requirement of RBPJ in Tₕ₁-cell differentiation has not yet been tested in experiments in which DLL proteins were used to induce Tₕ₁-cell differentiation. Furthermore, experimental evidence that supports the specific induction of different signalling pathways by the different Notch ligands is currently lacking. Aside from the possibility that different ligands might induce RBPJ-dependent or RBPJ-independent signalling, qualitatively different signalling could also depend on the activation of distinct Notch receptors by the different ligands. Indeed, one study showed that Notch3 induced Tₕ₁-cell differentiation,

Box 2 | Roles for Notch in T-helper-1- and T-helper-2-cell-mediated diseases

The involvement of Notch in T helper (T<sub>H</sub>)-cell differentiation has encouraged various groups to investigate how targeting this pathway might be exploited to treat T<sub>H</sub>1- or T<sub>H</sub>2-cell mediated diseases. Asthma is thought to be a T<sub>H</sub>2-cell mediated allergic disease. The exposure of lung dendritic cells to extract derived from house dust mites, a potent asthma-inducing allergen, resulted in the upregulation of Jagged2, which is in line with other data that support a role for Jagged proteins in promoting T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>60</sup>. In addition, the ability of Delta-like ligands (DLLs) to antagonize T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses has also been explored. Administration of a stimulatory DLL1–Fc fusion protein prevented airway responsiveness in sensitized mice, which was associated with decreased production of T<sub>H</sub>2-type cytokines and increased production of T<sub>H</sub>1-type cytokines<sup>40</sup>. Interestingly, a normally protective T<sub>H</sub>1-cell response to respiratory syncytial virus infection in the lungs was converted to a T<sub>H</sub>2-cell-mediated allergic response following antibody-mediated blockade of DLL4 (REF. 89), thereby revealing a role for DLL proteins in mediating the suppression of T<sub>H</sub>2-cell responses<sup>36</sup>.

Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a mouse model of multiple sclerosis that is mediated by T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cells. Treatment with a γ-secretase inhibitor reduced the severity of EAE and decreased T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses<sup>41,72</sup>. In addition, neutralizing antibodies that were specific for Notch3 (but not Notch1) inhibited the ability of myelin-primed T cells to transfer the disease<sup>72</sup>. In this case, both T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>17-cell responses were decreased<sup>72</sup>. In another study, antibodies that were specific for DLL1 attenuated EAE and reduced T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses, whereas an activating DLL1–Fc fusion protein exacerbated disease and enhanced T<sub>H</sub>1-cell responses<sup>39</sup>. Interestingly, targeting Jagged1 had the opposite effects to those observed with DLL-specific reagents: an antibody specific for Jagged1 exacerbated EAE, whereas the disease was ameliorated when Jagged1–Fc fusion proteins were administered to these mice. In the second study, the authors suggested that Jagged1 mediates protection against EAE by inducing the expression of interleukin-10 (REF. 39).

whereas Notch1 and Notch2 were reportedly involved in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation<sup>38,42</sup>. As the different Notch intracellular domains have different target gene preferences (as shown for different hairy and enhancer of split (HES) genes)<sup>27</sup>, this may allow them to induce the transcription of distinct genes during T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation.

Alternatively, quantitative rather than qualitative differences in signalling might determine the effect of Notch activation on T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation. For example, DLL proteins might bind Notch with greater avidity than Jagged ligands owing to Fringe-mediated glycosylation of Notch, which may result in stronger or weaker activation of the Notch signalling pathway. The concentration of intracellular Notch molecules may then determine which genes are activated, based on the ‘fit’ of Notch on different regulatory elements. Specifically, low concentrations of Notch might be required for its binding to genes in which other proteins that are bound to the surrounding chromatin create favourable binding conditions. By contrast, higher concentrations of Notch might be required for the expression of genes in which proteins that are bound to the surrounding chromatin do not allow Notch to bind so readily.

Finally, kinetic differences in Notch signalling might affect whether Notch instructs T<sub>H</sub>1- or T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation. The same Notch-mediated signal may lead to different outcomes depending on whether different Notch-responsive target genes are accessible during different stages of T<sub>H</sub>-cell activation. Again, activation of Notch by the different ligands might also be regulated by Fringe-mediated glycosylation, which in theory could differ between the early and late stages of T<sub>H</sub>-cell activation.

Conclusions

During the past few years, Notch has emerged as an important regulator of T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation, but its specific role has been controversial. We think that the evidence so far has been more convincing for a role for Notch in T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation than for a role in T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation. Although the evidence supporting a role for Notch in T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation cannot be discounted, we believe that the use of genetic approaches (that is, the study of DLL and Notch knockouts) to confirm this link is necessary to quell lingering scepticism. Such experiments should include IL-12-independent T<sub>H</sub>1-cell models, as current evidence suggests that the induction of DLL-mediated T<sub>H</sub>1-cell differentiation may be most important in the absence of IL-12. It will also be interesting to determine whether Notch has roles in the biology of any of the more recently described T<sub>H</sub>-cell subsets, such as T<sub>H</sub>17 cells, T follicular helper cells and IL-9-producing T cells<sup>1,72–75</sup>.

Although some of the mechanisms that are used by Notch to control T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation have been identified, many outstanding questions remain. First, the issue of whether the different Notch ligands — DLL and Jagged proteins — control the different types of T-cell response under physiological conditions requires confirmation by studies of mice that are deficient in each of these proteins. A second important question is to identify which unique components of the Notch signalling pathway determine whether Notch induces T<sub>H</sub>1- or T<sub>H</sub>2-cell differentiation. To address this, we first need to rigorously examine which known elements of the pathway (different Notch proteins and RBPJ) are involved in inducing each of the different T-cell responses. Information gained from such experiments will guide further theories surrounding this issue and direct future experiments to further probe the mechanisms that are involved in determining whether a T cell will become part of the T<sub>H</sub>1- or T<sub>H</sub>2-cell lineage. The identification of proteins that determine the outcome of Notch signalling on T<sub>H</sub>-cell differentiation will be essential to specifically target the Notch pathway for the treatment of T<sub>H</sub>1- and T<sub>H</sub>2-cell mediated diseases (BOX 2).
