Platinum-based drugs, and in particular *cis*-diammine-dichloroplatinum(II) (best known as cisplatin), are employed for the treatment of a wide array of solid malignancies, including testicular, ovarian, head and neck, colorectal, bladder and lung cancers. Cisplatin exerts anticancer effects via multiple mechanisms, yet its most prominent (and best understood) mode of action involves the generation of DNA lesions followed by the activation of the DNA damage response and the induction of mitochondrial apoptosis. Despite a consistent rate of initial responses, cisplatin treatment often results in the development of chemoresistance, leading to therapeutic failure. An intense research has been conducted during the past 30 years and several mechanisms that account for the cisplatin-resistant phenotype of tumor cells have been described. Here, we provide a systematic discussion of these mechanism by classifying them in alterations (1) that involve steps preceding the binding of cisplatin to DNA (pre-target resistance), (2) that directly relate to DNA-cisplatin adducts (on-target resistance), (3) concerning the lethal signaling pathway(s) elicited by cisplatin-mediated DNA damage (post-target resistance) and (4) affecting molecular circuits that do not present obvious links with cisplatin-elicited signals (off-target resistance). As in some clinical settings cisplatin constitutes the major therapeutic option, the development of chemosensitization strategies constitute a goal with important clinical implications.

## Introduction

First approved by FDA (Food and Drug Administration) in 1978 for the treatment of testicular and bladder cancer, *cis*-diamminedichloroplatinum(II) (best known as cisplatin or CDDP) is a largely employed platinum-based compound that exerts clinical activity against a wide spectrum of solid neoplasms, including testicular, bladder, ovarian, colorectal, lung and head and neck cancers (Prestayko *et al.*, 1979; Lebwohl and Canetta, 1998; Galanski, 2006). Cisplatin often leads to an initial therapeutic success associated with partial responses or disease stabilization. Still, many patients (in particular in the context of colorectal, lung and prostate cancers) are intrinsically resistant to cisplatin-based therapies. Moreover, an important fraction of originally sensitive tumors eventually develop chemoresistance (this is frequently observed in ovarian cancer patients) (Ozols, 1991; Giaccone, 2000; Koberle *et al.*, 2010). The cytotoxicity of cisplatin (which is given intravenously as short-term infusion in physiological saline) also affects kidneys (nephrotoxicity), peripheral nerves (neurotoxicity) and the inner ear (ototoxicity) (Cvitkovic *et al.*, 1977; Kelland, 2007). Still, the main limitation to the clinical usefulness of cisplatin as an anticancer drug is the high incidence of chemoresistance.

In the early 1980s, second-generation platinum compounds were developed with the specific aim of reducing the side effects of cisplatin while retaining its anticancer properties. These efforts led to the discovery of *cis*-diammine (cyclobutane-1,1-dicarboxylate-$O$,$O'$) platinum(II) (carboplatin), which essentially does not display nephro- and neurotoxicity, yet forms the same types of DNA adducts (see below) as cisplatin, although with a reduced potency (Harrap, 1985). Carboplatin, whose most prominent side effects concern the bone marrow, frequently leading to reversible thrombocytopenia, was approved by the FDA for the treatment of ovarian cancer in 1989. As the active form of carboplatin is identical to that of cisplatin (see below), it was not surprising to find out that most cisplatin-resistant tumors also fail to respond to carboplatin. These observations ignited another wave of drug development that in 2002 led to the introduction of [(1$R$,2$R$)-cyclohexane-1,2-diamine](ethanedioato-$O$,$O'$) platinum(II) (oxaliplatin) into clinical practice. Oxaliplatin exhibits distinct pharmacological and immunological properties than cisplatin and carboplatin, in line with the fact that it features the bidentate ligand 1,2-diaminocyclohexane in place of two monodentate ammine ligands (Kidani *et al.*, 1978). However, in spite of the fact that cisplatin-

refractory cancers are generally considered to be sensitive to oxaliplatin, clinical data suggest that there may be some degree of cross-resistance (Stordal *et al.*, 2007). Oxaliplatin is currently employed against colorectal cancer in association with 5-fluorouracil and folinic acid (the so-called FOLFOX protocol) (Giacchetti *et al.*, 2000; de Gramont *et al.*, 2000; Rothenberg *et al.*, 2003; Goldberg *et al.*, 2004), and may also be useful for the treatment of lung cancer (Raez *et al.*, 2010). Of note, other platinum derivatives that have recently entered clinical trials, such as amminedichloro(2-methylpyridine) platinum (picoplatin) and (OC-6-43)-bis(acetato) amminedichloro(cyclohexylamine)platinum (satraplatin), have not yet been shown to provide significant advantages over cisplatin, oxaliplatin and carboplatin (Choy, 2006; Eckardt *et al.*, 2009). Moreover, in specific clinical settings, cisplatin represents by far the most prominent, if not the sole, therapeutic option (Armstrong *et al.*, 2006).

Circumventing cisplatin resistance remains therefore a critical goal for anticancer therapy and considerable efforts have been undertaken to solve this problem throughout the past three decades. Here, we briefly introduce the modes of action of cisplatin and then systematically present the molecular mechanisms that can account for the cisplatin-resistant phenotype. Finally, we suggest combination strategies that might be exploited for reverting cisplatin resistance in tumors.

### Mode of action

The detailed description of the molecular mechanisms that underlie the anticancer potential of cisplatin goes largely beyond the scope of this review, and can be found elsewhere (Kelman and Peresie, 1979; Sanderson *et al.*, 1996; Siddik, 2003). Here, we will provide key facts that explain the molecular basis of cisplatin resistance.

Cisplatin exerts anticancer effects via an intertwined signaling pathway that might be separated into one nuclear and one cytoplasmic module. As such, cisplatin is inert and must be intracellularly activated by a series of aquation reactions that consist in the substitution of one or both cis-chloro groups with water molecules (el-Khateeb *et al.*, 1999; Kelland, 2000). This reaction occurs spontaneously in the cytoplasm, owing to the relatively low concentration of chloride ions (~2–10 mM when compared with ~100 mM in the extracellular milieu), and leads to the generation of highly reactive mono- and bi-aquated cisplatin forms (Eastman, 1987a; Michalke, 2010). These molecules are prone to interact with a wide number of cytoplasmic substrates, and in particular with endogenous nucleophiles such as reduced glutathione (GSH), methionine, metallothioneins and proteins (via their cysteines) (Timerbaev *et al.*, 2006). Thus, cytoplasmic cisplatin has the potential to deplete reduced equivalents and to tilt the redox balance toward oxidative stress (which facilitates DNA damage; see below), but is also susceptible to inactivation by a number of cytoprotective antioxidant systems (Koberle *et al.*, 2010).

Aquated cisplatin avidly binds DNA, with a predilection for nucleophilic N7-sites on purine bases. This leads to the generation of protein–DNA complexes as well as of DNA–DNA inter- and intra-strand adducts (Eastman, 1987b). Although the signaling pathways that are triggered by protein/cisplatin/DNA complexes have been largely ignored, great efforts have been spent to elucidate the molecular cascades that are activated by DNA–DNA inter- and intra-strand adducts. The latter—and notably 1,2-intrastrand ApG and CpG crosslinks—have been indicated as the most prominent cisplatin-induced DNA lesions and have been suggested to account for most, if not all, cisplatin cytotoxicity (Kelland *et al.*, 1993). This notion, which in the past has generated a vivid debate, nowadays appears as an oversimplification, especially in consideration of the fact that: (1) only ~1% of intracellular cisplatin binds to nuclear DNA (Gonzalez *et al.*, 2001) and (2) cisplatin (as well as oxaliplatin) has been shown to exert significant cytotoxicity in enucleated cells (cytoplasts) (Mandic *et al.*, 2003; Berndtsson *et al.*, 2007; Obeid *et al.*, 2007). Irrespective of this, the best-characterized mode of action of cisplatin involves the DNA-damage response and mitochondrial apoptosis (Jamieson and Lippard, 1999; Cohen and Lippard, 2001).

Cisplatin-induced lesions cause distortions in DNA that can be recognized by multiple repair pathways (Bellon *et al.*, 1991). Among these, the nucleotide excision repair (NER) reportedly constitutes the most prominent mechanism for the removal of cisplatin adducts (Chaney and Sancar, 1996; Furuta *et al.*, 2002). However, proteins belonging to the mismatch repair (MMR) system also participate in the recognition and resolution of cisplatin lesions (Kunkel and Erie, 2005). When the extent of damage is limited, cisplatin adducts induce an arrest in the S and G₂ phases of the cell cycle, a phenomenon that exerts cytoprotective effects by (1) allowing repair mechanisms to re-establish DNA integrity and (2) preventing potentially abortive or abnormal mitoses (Vitale *et al.*, 2011). Conversely, if DNA damage is beyond repair, cells become committed to (most often apoptotic) death.

The major signaling cascade that bridges cisplatin-induced DNA lesions to apoptosis involves the sequential activation of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM)- and RAD3-related protein (ATR, a sensor of DNA damage) and checkpoint kinase 1 (CHEK1, the most prominent substrate and downstream effector of ATR), which in turn phosphorylates the tumor suppression protein TP53 on serine 20, allowing for its stabilization (Shieh *et al.*, 2000; Appella and Anderson, 2001; Damia *et al.*, 2001; Zhao and Piwnica-Worms, 2001). Activated TP53 exerts lethal functions via nuclear and cytoplasmic mechanisms that eventually lead to mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization or increased signaling via death receptors followed by cell death (Kroemer *et al.*, 2007; Galluzzi *et al.*, 2011) In response to cisplatin, CHEK1 has also been shown to activate various branches of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) system, including those mediated by extracellular signal-regulated kinases, c-JUN

N-terminal kinases and stress-activated protein kinases (Persons *et al.*, 2000; Wang *et al.*, 2000; Dent and Grant, 2001; Yeh *et al.*, 2002). The relative contribution of these signaling modules to the cytotoxic effects of cisplatin remain to be deciphered, as contrasting reports can be found in literature (Dent and Grant, 2001). Intriguingly, although ATM (another important sensor of DNA damage) appears to participate in cisplatin-induced cell cycle arrest but not cell death (Sancar *et al.*, 2004; Wang *et al.*, 2006), its major downstream target, CHEK2, has been shown to convey lethal signals in response to cisplatin in an ATM-independent fashion (Damia *et al.*, 2001; Pabla *et al.*, 2008).

Thus, there appear to be multiple mechanisms that underlie the cytotoxic and antiproliferative potential of cisplatin (Figure 1). The cisplatin-resistant phenotype of cancer cells can derive from alterations in any of these molecular circuitries as well as from changes that affect the intracellular uptake of cisplatin or the execution of the apoptotic program.

## Mechanisms of pre-target resistance

There are at least two mechanisms by which cancer cells elude the cytotoxic potential of cisplatin before it binds to cytoplasmic targets and DNA: (1) a reduced intracellular accumulation of cisplatin and (2) an increased sequestration of cisplatin by GSH, metallothioneins and other cytoplasmic ‘scavengers’ with nucleophilic properties (Table 1).

A wide array of (mostly natural) anticancer agents is associated with the so-called multidrug resistance, a phenomenon whereby drugs are subjected to increased efflux via relatively nonselective members of the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) family of ATPases like the P-glycoprotein (Molnar *et al.*, 2010). This is not the case of cisplatin, whose limited intracellular accumulation most often (although not always; see below) derives from reduced uptake (Smith *et al.*, 1993; Wada *et al.*, 1999; Baekelandt *et al.*, 2000). Irrespective of the underlying mechanisms, several cisplatin-resistant cancer cells exhibit consistent reductions in the accumulation of cisplatin (Loh *et al.*, 1992; Mellish *et al.*, 1993).

For a long time, cisplatin was believed to enter cells prominently by passive diffusion across the plasma membrane, mainly because the uptake of cisplatin, which is highly polar, is relatively slow when compared with that of chemically similar anticancer agents that are actively transported (Yoshida *et al.*, 1994; Kelland, 2000). More recently, however, the copper transporter 1 (CTR1), a transmembrane protein involved in copper homeostasis, turned out to play an important role in the uptake of cisplatin. *Ctrl*⁻/⁻ mouse embryonic fibroblasts accumulate much less cisplatin than their wild-type counterparts, and are indeed two- to three-fold more resistant to its cytotoxic effects (Ishida *et al.*, 2002; Katano *et al.*, 2002; Holzer *et al.*, 2006). Accordingly, cells pre-treated with copper (the main CTR1 substrate) are protected from cisplatin cytotoxicity (More *et al.*, 2010), whereas copper chelators result in

Figure 1 Modes of action of cisplatin. Because of the relatively low (compared with the extracellular microenvironment) concentration of chloride ions, intracellular cisplatin quickly becomes aquated and hence highly reactive. Aquated cisplatin can indeed bind a plethora of nucleophilic species, including cysteine and methionine residues on proteins and DNA bases. In the nucleus, this leads to the generation of inter- and intra-strand adducts that are recognized by the DNA damage-sensing machinery. If the extent of damage is beyond repair, cisplatin adducts trigger the activation of a DNA damage response (DDR) that frequently involves the ATR kinase, CHEK1 and CHEK2 and the tumor-suppressor protein TP53. In turn, TP53 transactivates several genes whose products facilitate mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), thereby triggering intrinsic apoptosis, as well as genes that encode for components of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway. MOMP (alone or with the contribution of death receptor-ignited, BID-transduced signals) sets off the caspase cascade as well as multiple caspase-independent mechanisms that eventually seal the cell fate. Several other signaling pathways link cisplatin-induced DNA damage to MOMP and cell death (not shown, see the main text for further details). In the cytoplasm, the interaction between cisplatin and GSH, metallothioneins or mitochondrial proteins like the VDAC results in the depletion of reducing equivalents and/or directly sustains the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). ROS can directly trigger MOMP or exacerbate cisplatin-induced DNA damage, thereby playing a dual role in cisplatin cytotoxicity.

increased cisplatin accumulation and exacerbate cytotoxicity (Ishida *et al.*, 2010). Of note, clinically relevant concentrations of cisplatin reportedly downregulate CTR1, owing to internalization followed by proteasome-mediated degradation (Holzer and Howell, 2006). This mechanism may account (at least in part) for multiple instances of acquired cisplatin resistance. Early reports suggested that ABC ATPases like multidrug resistance protein (MRP) 1, MRP2, MRP3 and MRP5 would also mediate some extent of cisplatin resistance by increasing cisplatin export (Borst *et al.*, 2000). In particular, results from genetic manipulations (that is, overexpression, RNA interference) pointed to MRP2 as the major ATPase responsible for an increased efflux of cisplatin in resistant cells (Koike *et al.*, 1997; Cui *et al.*, 1999; Liedert *et al.*, 2003). Recent reports reinforced the notion that MRP2 expression levels might predict the responsiveness of tumors to platinum-based therapies (Korita *et al.*, 2010; Yamasaki *et al.*, 2011). Following the discovery of the role of CTR1 in cisplatin uptake, however, attention was attracted by two copper-extruding P-type ATPases, ATP7A and ATP7B. These proteins are upregulated in cisplatin-resistant cancer cell lines (Safaei *et al.*, 2004), and their transfection-enforced overexpression has been shown to drive the acquisition of the cisplatin-resistant phenotype (Samimi *et al.*, 2004). Importantly, clinical studies indicate that ATP7B

expression levels might predict the sensitivity of ovarian and endometrial cancers to cisplatin chemotherapy (Nakayama *et al.*, 2002, 2004; Aida *et al.*, 2005). Still, in line with the multifactorial nature of cisplatin efflux (and resistance; see below), small molecules that inhibit specific ABC transporters (for example, the P-glycoprotein-specific inhibitor 5-bromotetrandrine) appear to be unable *per se* to restore cisplatin accumulation and sensitivity (Jin *et al.*, 2005).

Aquated cisplatin avidly binds to cytoplasmic nucleophilic species, including GSH, methionine, metallothioneins and other cysteine-rich proteins. On one hand, this may underlie at least part of the cytoplasmic effects of cisplatin, resulting in the depletion of antioxidant reserves and in the establishment of oxidative stress (Slater *et al.*, 1995). On the other hand, nucleophilic species act as cytoplasmic scavengers, thereby limiting the amount of reactive cisplatin (Kasahara *et al.*, 1991; Sakamoto *et al.*, 2001). Thus, elevated levels of GSH, of the enzyme that catalyzes GSH synthesis (that is, γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase), or of the enzyme that mediates the conjugation between cisplatin and GSH (that is, glutathione S-transferase) have been observed in the context of cisplatin resistance, both *in vitro* and *ex vivo* (in cancer cell lines that were derived from one ovarian carcinoma patient before and after the development of resistance) (Lewis *et al.*, 1988). Of note,

glutathione S-conjugates are readily extruded by cells via MRP1 or MRP2, possibly explaining why the latter has been more robustly associated with cisplatin resistance than other ABC ATPases (Ishikawa, 1992). Genetic manipulations of human and murine cells have also linked increased levels of metallothioneins, a class of low-molecular-weight thiol-containing proteins that are involved in the binding and detoxification of heavy metal ions, to the cisplatin-resistant phenotype (Kelley *et al.*, 1988; Kasahara *et al.*, 1991). However, conclusive clinical data on this correlation are missing.

### Mechanisms of on-target resistance

The recognition of inter- and intra-strand DNA adducts and the consequent generation of an apoptotic signal is often impaired in cisplatin-resistant cancer cells because of a variety of defects. Alternatively, cisplatin-resistant cells acquire the ability to repair adducts at an increased pace, or become able to tolerate unrepaired DNA lesions, thanks to a particular class of DNA polymerases that mediate the so-called translesion synthesis (Table 2).

The majority of cisplatin lesions are removed from DNA by the NER system (Wood *et al.*, 2000; Shuck *et al.*, 2008). In this setting, damaged nucleotides are excised from DNA upon incision on both sides of the lesion, followed by DNA synthesis to reconstitute genetic integrity (Gillet and Scharer, 2006). At least 20 proteins participate in NER, including excision repair cross-complementing rodent repair deficiency, complementation group 1 (ERCC1), a single-strand DNA endonuclease that forms a tight heterodimer with ERCC4 (also known as xeroderma pigmentosum complementation group F (XPF)) and incises DNA on the 5′ side of bulky lesions such as cisplatin adducts (Biggerstaff and Wood, 1992; Sijbers *et al.*, 1996; Ahmad *et al.*, 2008). Early reports pointed to a correlation between NER proficiency and cisplatin resistance in multiple preclinical models (Li *et al.*, 1998, 2000; Metzger *et al.*, 1998), and subsequent studies supported this notion at the clinical level. Thus, ERCC1 expression (be it measured at the mRNA or protein level) has been negatively correlated with survival and/or responsiveness to cisplatin-based regimens in several human neoplasms including bladder (Bellmunt *et al.*, 2007), colorectal (Shirota *et al.*, 2001), gastric (Metzger *et al.*, 1998), esophageal (Kim *et al.*, 2008), head and neck (Handra-Luca *et al.*, 2007; Jun *et al.*, 2008) and ovarian cancers (Dabholkar *et al.*, 1992), as well as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Olaussen *et al.*, 2006). ERCC1 also participates in interstrand crosslink repair (ICR), and ICR proficiency appears to be reduced and augmented in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant tumor cells, respectively (Zhen *et al.*, 1992; Usanova *et al.*, 2010).

It should be noted that increased levels of ERCC1 does not necessarily (and have never been formally shown to) correspond to increased NER and ICR proficiency in patients (as methods that reliably measure

Chemoresistance to cisplatin  
L Galluzzi *et al*

NER and ICR activity in patient material are missing), although ERCC1 constitutes one of the rate-limiting factors for NER (Niedernhofer *et al.*, 2001, 2004; Ahmad *et al.*, 2008). Moreover, although the absence of ERCC1 consistently correlates with cisplatin responsiveness, both *in vitro* and *in vivo* (in patients), the same does not hold true for ERCC1 overexpression, which in some instances resulted in increased, rather than decreased, sensitivity (Bramson and Panasci, 1993). This might be because of *disequilibria* in the components of complex DNA repair pathways such as NER (Coquerelle *et al.*, 1995). However, it remains formally possible that ERCC1 levels affect cisplatin resistance via hitherto uncharacterized NER- and/or ICR-independent pathways. Irrespective of this issue, ERCC1 expression constitutes a very promising biomarker for the prediction of cisplatin responsiveness in patients (Olaussen, 2009), and has already begun to be exploited in this sense in clinical settings.

Cisplatin-induced DNA lesions can be detected (but not repaired) by the MMR system, which normally handles erroneous insertions, deletions and mis-incorporations of bases that can arise during DNA replication and recombination (Vaisman *et al.*, 1998; Kunkel and Erie, 2005). MMR-related proteins that participate in the recognition of GpG interstrand adducts include MSH2 and MLH1 (Mello *et al.*, 1996; Vaisman *et al.*, 1998). According to accepted viewpoints, MMR proteins would attempt to repair cisplatin adducts, fail, and hence transmit a proapoptotic signal (Vaisman *et al.*, 1998). In line with this model, *MSH2* and *MLH1* are often mutated or underexpressed in the context of acquired cisplatin resistance (Aebi *et al.*, 1996; Drummond *et al.*, 1996; Brown *et al.*, 1997; Fink *et al.*, 1998), although NSCLC patients with high MSH2 expression who do not undergo cisplatin treatment upon tumor resection have a better prognosis than patients with low MSH2 levels (Kamal *et al.*, 2010). This apparent discrepancy simply reflects the intrinsic difference between naive, previously untreated tumors (for which high MSH2 levels constitute a good prognostic indicator) and cancers that have acquired resistance upon cisplatin exposure (which are often associated with reduced MSH2 expression). Thus, at least in some clinical settings, a high DNA repair capacity appears to protect against tumor relapse (Kamal *et al.*, 2010) but may prevent patients to benefit from DNA-damaging agents. Of note, defects in MLH1 and MSH6 (another component of the MMR system) are associated with increased level of translesion synthesis, the phenomenon whereby DNA synthesis is not blocked but proceeds beyond cisplatin adducts (Bassett *et al.*, 2002). Translesion synthesis, which is also known as replicative bypass, is mediated by the concerted activity of a specific group of DNA polymerases including POLH, POLI, POLK, REV1, REV3 and REV7 (Shachar *et al.*, 2009). POLH and the REV3-REV7 heterodimer appear to be involved in the replicative bypass of GpG adducts (Alt *et al.*, 2007; Shachar *et al.*, 2009). Defects in POLH and REV3 have been linked to increased sensitivity to cisplatin in multiple tumor cell lines, *in vitro* (Wittschie-

ben et al., 2006; Roos et al., 2009), whereas REV3 together, these observations suggest that the expression levels of components of the MMR and translesion synthesis systems may constitute useful predictors of cisplatin responsiveness in clinical settings, although compelling data on this issue have not yet been reported. Cisplatin-induced inter-strand adducts can lead to the so-called double-strand breaks, DNA lesions that are normally repaired in the S phase of the cell cycle (or shortly after) by the machinery for homologous

recombination (HR) (Smith *et al.*, 2010). Two critical components of the HR system are encoded by *BRCA1* and *BRCA2*, two genes that are frequently mutated in familial breast and ovarian cancers (Venkitaraman, 2002; Narod and Foulkes, 2004). Notably, HR-deficient cancers have a different phenotype and are often more sensitive to crosslinking agents including cisplatin than their HR-proficient counterparts (Bryant *et al.*, 2005; Farmer *et al.*, 2005; Ratnam and Low, 2007). For instance, BRCA1/2-deficient ovarian cancers metastasize to viscera more frequently than sporadic epithelial ovarian cancers (which most often remain confined to the peritoneum), yet are generally more responsive to platinum compounds and associated with better prognosis (Ben David *et al.*, 2002; Chetrit *et al.*, 2008; Gourley *et al.*, 2010). Moreover, it has been shown that cisplatin resistance can develop in initially cisplatin-sensitive tumors because of secondary mutations that compensate for BRCA1/2 deficiency and re-establish HR (Edwards *et al.*, 2008; Sakai *et al.*, 2008). Altogether, these observations suggest that the HR status, at least in specific clinical settings, has an important prognostic and predictive value.

As the catalog of cisplatin interactors that may be implicated in its cytotoxicity has not yet been entirely elucidated, cytoplasmic proteins may also be responsible for (at least part of) the cisplatin-resistant phenotype. With regard to this, cisplatin has been shown to bind mitochondrial DNA as well as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC) (Yang *et al.*, 2006), a mitochondrial protein with vital and lethal functions (Kroemer *et al.*, 2007). Notably, VDAC-depleted cancer cells are highly resistant to CDDP treatment (Tajeddine *et al.*, 2008), yet it is not clear whether this constitutes an example of on-target resistance or whether in this context VDAC simply transduces upstream proapoptotic signals (and hence would be involved in a post-target resistance mechanism).

### Mechanism of post-target resistance

Post-target resistance to cisplatin can result from a plethora of alterations including defects in the signal transduction pathways that normally elicit apoptosis in response to DNA damage as well as problems with the cell death executioner machinery itself. Nonrepairable cisplatin-induced DNA damage leads to the activation of a multibranched signaling cascade with proapoptotic outcomes (see above). Genetic and epigenetic alterations in the components of this complex signaling network have been associated with variable levels of resistance to cisplatin, presumably reflecting the relative relevance of specific proteins (and the underlying pathways) in different cellular and experimental settings (Table 3).

One of the most predominant mechanisms of post-target resistance involves the inactivation of TP53 (Vousden and Lane, 2007), which occurs in approximately half of all human neoplasms (Kirsch and Kastan, 1998). This has been documented *in vitro*, by comparing the sensitivity to cisplatin of a wide panel of TP53- proficient and -deficient tumor cell lines (O'Connor *et al.*, 1997; Branch *et al.*, 2000), and also *in vivo*, in the clinical setting (Hengstler *et al.*, 2001). Thus, ovarian cancer patients harboring wild-type TP53 reportedly have a higher probability to benefit from cisplatin-based chemotherapy than patients with TP53 mutations (Gadducci *et al.*, 2002; Feldman *et al.*, 2008). Moreover, testicular germ cell tumors, which are particularly sensitive to cisplatin, are one of the few cancers in which TP53 is rarely, if ever, inactivated (Peng *et al.*, 1993). Other members of the TP53 protein family, notably the transactivation-incompetent TP63 variant ΔNp63α, have recently been shown to transduce prosurvival signals in response to cisplatin (Yuan *et al.*, 2010), but the putative clinical implications of these observations remain to be established.

Intriguingly enough, tetraploid cancer cells have been shown to endure DNA-damaging agents (including cisplatin and oxaliplatin) far better (>10-fold) than their diploid counterparts (Castedo *et al.*, 2006; Vitale *et al.*, 2007). This phenomenon can be reverted by the depletion/inhibition of TP53, its target ribonucleotide reductase M2 B (RRM2B) or CHEK1 (Castedo *et al.*, 2006; Vitale *et al.*, 2007), implying that the cisplatin-resistant phenotype of tetraploid cancer cells relies on complex mechanisms that go beyond a merely stoichiometric (on-target) process whereby the double amount of DNA entirely accounts for resistance. Altogether, these observations suggest that multiple factors, including ploidy, are likely to affect the molecular mechanisms that underlie cisplatin resistance.

Preclinical studies suggest that other proapoptotic signal transducers such as MAPK family members might contribute to the cisplatin-resistant phenotype (Mansouri *et al.*, 2003; Brozovic and Osmak, 2007). In particular, it has been proposed that cisplatin-resistant cells would fail to activate MAPK1 (also known as p38<sup>MAPK</sup>) and c-JUN N-terminal kinase in a sustained fashion in response to cisplatin (Mansouri *et al.*, 2003; Brozovic *et al.*, 2004). This would limit signaling through the FAS/FASL system (an inducer of extrinsic apoptosis) and hence confer cytoprotection (Spierings *et al.*, 2003). Contrarily to the case of TP53, so far no correlation has been found between the levels of MAPKs or MAPK-related proteins and cisplatin sensitivity in patients.

Alterations in any of the factors that regulate and execute apoptosis, be it triggered by DNA damage or oxidative stress via the mitochondrial pathway or be it mediated by the extrinsic route, have the potential to influence cisplatin sensitivity. Several dozens of proteins (including death receptors, cytoplasmic adaptors, pro- and antiapoptotic members of the BCL-2 protein family, caspases, calpains, mitochondrial intermembrane proteins and many others) participate in these lethal cascades and most of them have been shown to modulate the response to cisplatin (as well as to a plethora of other chemotherapeutic agents, drugs, toxins and stressors) *in vitro* (de La Motte Rouge *et al.*, 2007; Sakai *et al.*, 2008; Tajeddine *et al.*, 2008; Wang *et al.*, 2010; Janson *et al.*, 2011). However, only some of these proteins predict cisplatin responsiveness in the clinical setting.

For instance, conclusive clinical data on the association between the proapoptotic BCL-2 family members BAX and BAK and cisplatin sensitivity are missing, but elevated levels of their antiapoptotic counterparts including BCL-2, BCL-X<sub>L</sub> and MCL-1 (myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1) reportedly correlate with cisplatin resistance and tumor recurrence in multiple clinical scenarios, including head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer and NSCLC (Han et al., 2003; Erovic et al., 2005; Williams et al., 2005; Michaud et al., 2009). Moreover, ongoing clinical trials are evaluating the combination of cisplatin with small molecules that inhibit BCL-2-like proteins (for example, ABT-263, ABT-737) for the treatment of several neoplasms (Jain and Meyer-Hermann, 2011). Increased levels of survivin, a caspase-inhibitory protein that is frequently upregulated in response to cisplatin by phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT1-dependent mechanisms (Ikeguchi and Kaibara, 2001), inversely correlate with cisplatin responsiveness and favorable clinical outcome in gastric,

esophageal and ovarian cancer and NSCLC patients (Kato et al., 2001; Nakamura et al., 2004; Karczmarek-Borowska et al., 2005). Of note, survivin inhibitors (for example, YM155, LY2181308) are currently being evaluated as single agents or in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of several malignancies (Ryan et al., 2009) (http://clinicaltrials.gov). Along similar lines, high levels of XIAP-associated factor 1 (XAF1), a tumor-suppressor protein that antagonizes inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (Plenchette et al., 2007), are associated with improved progression-free survival in advanced bladder cancer patients (Pinho et al., 2009).

Mechanisms of off-target resistance

Accumulating evidence suggests that the cisplatin-resistant phenotype can also be sustained (if not entirely generated) by alterations in signaling pathways that are not directly engaged by cisplatin, yet compensate for

(and hence interrupt) cisplatin-induced lethal signals (Table 4).

The ERBB2 protooncogene (also known as HER-2 or NEU) codes for a member of the epidermal growth factor receptor family of tyrosine kinases and is amplified or overexpressed in multiple types of neoplasms, including breast and ovarian cancers (Slamon et al., 1989; Hengstler et al., 1999). ERBB2 signals are propagated via multiple downstream pathways, including the SHC/GRB2/SOS and the PI3K/AKT1 cascades (Citri and Yarden, 2006). Whereas baseline signaling via PI3K/AKT1 upregulates the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A, also known as p21<sup>Cip1</sup> or p21<sup>Waf1</sup>) (Mitsuuchi et al., 2000), ERBB2 overexpression leads to CDKN1A nuclear exclusion (although an AKT1-mediated, phosphorylation-dependent mechanism) (Zhou et al., 2001). This is intriguing, as both mechanisms might actually contribute to cisplatin resistance. Initially, a CDKN1A-mediated cell cycle arrest (as that promoted by basal PI3K/AKT1 activity) would exert antiapoptotic functions by providing cells with time for DNA repair and homeostasis re-establishment. Later on, however, cells would need to recover proliferation, and this might be favored by the nuclear exclusion of CDKN1A following increased PI3K/AKT1 activity, an alteration that often occurs upon cisplatin treatment (Ikeguchi and Kaibara, 2001). Of note, ERBB2 overexpression has been associated with a slightly significant trend toward cisplatin resistance in NSCLC patients (Fijolek et al., 2006). Dual-specificity Y-phosphorylation regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B, also known as MIRK) is upregulated in multiple solid tumors (Friedman, 2007) and exerts

prosurvival functions by increasing the expression of antioxidant enzymes such as ferrooxidase, superoxide dismutase 2 and superoxide dismutase 3 (Deng et al., 2009). In NSCLC and ovarian cancer cells, DYRK1B depletion has been shown to potentiate the effects of subapoptotic cisplatin concentrations by favoring the establishment of lethal oxidative stress (Gao et al., 2009; Hu and Friedman, 2010). With regard to this, it would be interesting to precisely determine to which extent cisplatin-induced reactive oxygen species directly trigger cell death (via cytoplasmic mechanisms) and to which extent they favor cell death by exacerbating cisplatin-induced DNA damage. From this perspective, GSH appears to mediate not only pre-target resistance (by binding cisplatin and preventing its interaction with DNA and other targets) but also post-target resistance (by quenching proapoptotic reactive oxygen species generated in response to cisplatin) and perhaps off-target resistance (by rendering cells globally less sensitive to cell death signals).

Other general stress response pathways or poorly characterized mechanisms have been linked to cisplatin resistance. The former include autophagy, an evolutionary conserved catabolic pathway that involves the sequestration and lysosomal degradation of organelles and portions of the cytoplasm (Kroemer et al., 2010), and the heat-shock response, the integrated reaction of cells to high temperatures as well as to a plethora of stressful conditions that affect protein folding (Yamamoto et al., 2001; Macleod et al., 2005; Donnelly and Blagg, 2008). Both ovarian and NSCLC cells have been shown to progressively acquire cisplatin resistance while upregulating components of the autophagic

pathway (Ren *et al.*, 2010; Yu *et al.*, 2011). Accordingly, autophagy inhibition reportedly can restore some extent of cisplatin sensitivity, at least *in vitro* (Ren *et al.*, 2010), although inhibitors of the mammalian target of rapamycin kinase like temsirolimus (which stimulates rather than inhibits autophagy) have been shown to synergize with cisplatin in the killing of human oropharyngeal carcinoma cells (Gaur *et al.*, 2011). Presumably, this apparent discrepancy reflects the existence of multiple, sometimes cell type-specific, mechanisms that lead to cisplatin resistance.

Molecular chaperones that are involved in the heat-shock and unfolded protein responses, such as several heat-shock proteins, have also been shown to promote cisplatin resistance via multiple, most often indirect, mechanisms (Yamamoto *et al.*, 2001; Zhang and Shen, 2007; Ren *et al.*, 2008). Heat-shock protein 27 expression levels can predict the response to cisplatin-based therapies in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma patients (Miyazaki *et al.*, 2005). Finally, one recent report demonstrates that the hypothetical membrane protein TMEM205 is associated with cisplatin resistance *in vitro* (Shen *et al.*, 2010); yet, the clinical relevance of this observation remains to be elucidated.

### Concluding remarks

Cisplatin is an important therapeutic tool in the combat against several solid neoplasms, including (but not limited to) head and neck, ovarian and lung cancers. Unfortunately, cancer cells either intrinsically are or relatively rapidly become resistant to cisplatin, leading to relapse and therapeutic failure. As discussed in this review, there are at least four distinct classes of mechanisms by which cancer cells become resistant to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. One major problem for overcoming this clinically relevant issue is that—frequently—more than one resistance mechanism is activated, that is, cisplatin resistance often exhibits a multifactorial nature. This notion is supported by a large amount of literature indicating that (1) a linear correlation between cisplatin-induced cellular alterations and responsiveness can be found in a very restricted number of settings and that (2) most often the inhibition of single pathways that sustain cisplatin resistance fails to restore sensitivity to normal levels (some extent of residual resistance remain). In addition, whereas oxaliplatin has recently been shown to induce a type of cell death that is immunogenic (that is, it stimulates a tumor-specific cognate immune response) (Tesniere *et al.*, 2010), cisplatin fails to do so (Obeid *et al.*, 2007; Kepp *et al.*, 2011).

In view of these considerations, it is tempting to speculate that the most successful strategies for circumventing resistance will have to target at least two distinct mechanisms (Figure 2). At present, it remains to be precisely determined which of these mechanisms should be preferentially modulated for optimal chemosensitization, and this is likely to depend (at least in part) on clinical variables (that is, type of cancer, intrinsic or acquired resistance). Nevertheless, combined interventions

**Figure 2** Strategies for reverting cisplatin resistance. Cisplatin resistance most often has a multifactorial nature, implying that targeting one mechanism of resistance at a time has very low chances to result in significant chemosensitization. Thus, combination strategies for blocking cisplatin resistance at multiple levels should be designed. With regard to this, detailed information on the patient genetic and epigenetic background might be critical for determining which specific mechanisms should be targeted to fully circumvent chemoresistance. EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; HSP, heat-shock protein; PTEN, phosphatase and tensin homolog; TLS, translesion synthesis.

that aim at simultaneously limiting pre-target resistance (for example, copper chelators or other agents that maximize intracellular accumulation) and interrupting post-, on- or off-target mechanisms (for example, MMR-activating agents, PI3K/AKT1 inhibitors, blockers of autophagy) may turn out to restore cisplatin sensitivity to therapeutically useful levels. In addition, chemicals that stimulate an endoplasmic reticulum stress may be useful to convert cisplatin into an inducer of immunogenic cell death (Martins *et al.*, 2011). Further investigation is required to see if and which one of the many possible strategies for overcoming cisplatin resistance will match the expectations. Of note, despite encouraging preclinical results, coordination complexes based on metals other than cisplatin (for example, palladium) that have been developed to circumvent cisplatin resistance have never been tested in the clinical setting (Serrano *et al.*, 2011). The elucidation of the mechanisms by which tumors become refractory to cisplatin will lead not only to optimal chemosensitization strategies, but also to the discovery of new prognostic and predictive biomarkers. Together with the tools that are currently available to clinicians, this new knowledge will allow for better patient stratification and will surely lead to the development of more efficient and less toxic anticancer therapies.
