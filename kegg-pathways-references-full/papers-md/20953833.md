**Abstract** The primary aim of this study was to elucidate the role of the estrogen receptor (ER), a transcription factor involved in the nicotine- and 17β-estradiol (E2)-mediated up-regulation of α9-nAChR gene expression. A real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to quantify the α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels of surgically isolated (*n* = 339) and laser-capture microdissected tissues (ER+ versus ER−, *n* = 6 per group). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and luciferase-promoter activity assays were used to investigate the ER-mediated transcriptional regulation of α9-nAChR gene expression. We observed that breast tumors with higher α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels (i.e., a mean fold ratio in the tumor/normal-paired samples of greater than tenfold) were associated with the lowest 5-year disease-specific survival rate (50%, dead/alive = 4/4, total = 8 patients, *P* = 0.006), in contrast to breast tumors with low levels (i.e., a mean fold ratio of less than onefold) of α9-nAChR expression (88%, dead/alive = 3/22, total = 25 patients). Furthermore, higher α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels were preferentially detected in ER+ tumor tissues in comparison to ER− tumor tissues (ER+ versus ER− patients: *n* = 160 vs. 72; mean fold ratios of α9-nAChR expression = 11 ± 3 vs. 6.7 ± 2.3 fold, respectively).

assays demonstrated that the ER is a major transcription factor that mediates nicotine- and E2-induced up-regulation of α9-nAChR gene expression in MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our data indicate that the ER plays a central role in mediating α9-nAChR gene up-regulation in response to either nicotine or E2 stimulation.

angiogenesis in tumors [10–12]. Such results imply that nicotinic alteration of normal breast epithelial cells may also contribute to breast cancer tumorigenesis.

Among all of the body tissues, human neuronal tissues have been reported to exhibit the most abundant expression of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) subunits. These receptors are composed either of heteropentamers that comprise a combination of α (α1–α6) and β (β2–β4) subunits or homopentamers consisting of α7–α10 subunits that are symmetrically arranged around a central ion pore [13, 14]. The physiological ligand of nAChRs is acetylcholine; however, some tobacco components, including nicotine and its active metabolites, such as the nitrosamines N'-nitrosonornicotine and NNK, are high-affinity agonists of nAChRs [15, 16]. Recent studies have shown that nAChRs can accelerate cell proliferation, tumor invasion, and angiogenesis in addition to conferring resistance against apoptosis [17–21].

The relationships among breast cancer formation, the estrogen receptor (ER) (which mediates both hormone-induced gene transcription and anti-estrogen action against breast cancer), and ER ligands (such as estrogen, E2) have been discussed in a recent article [22]. E2s, a group of steroid hormones, act primarily by regulating gene expression after binding to the ER, a nuclear ligand-activated transcription factor. The binding of an agonist (E2) induces a conformational change in the ER that enables it to homodimerize. This dimer is then translocated to the nucleus where it enhances gene transcription [23]. ER activity may modulate the rate of transcription initiation by interacting with the basal transcriptional machinery and by changing the chromatin arrangement at the promoters of its target genes via the recruitment of a variety of coactivators [24]. This ER/coactivator complex activates DNA transcription by stimulating E2-responsive elements [23]. Additional target molecules that are involved in ER-mediated signaling pathways in breast cancer formation, however, remain to be identified.

Smoking and hormones are two important etiological factors involved in breast cancer formation [25]. A recent study published by our lab demonstrated that α9-nAChR expression plays a decisive role in smoking-induced breast cancer formation [26]. In this study, we demonstrated that nicotine and E2 both induced α9-nAChR expression in human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells. Interestingly, we also showed that ERs were activated by treatment with either nicotine or E2. Promoter activity assays showed that ERs specifically bound to the α9-nAChR promoter at the activating protein 1 (AP1)-binding site [27]. These results indicate that ER-induced α9-nAChR up-regulation plays a central role in the response to endogenous (E2) or exogenous (nicotine) stimulation, which confers the carcinogenic effects observed in human breast tumor formation.

**Introduction**

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the USA [1]. Tobacco, a substance that contains human carcinogens, may contribute to the risk for breast cancer development in women [2]. Large cohort epidemiological studies that were performed in the USA and Japan indicate that the risk for breast cancer is associated with both active and passive smoking [3, 4]. Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of over 4,000 chemical constituents. On average, roughly 1.0 mg (range 0.3–2.0 mg) of nicotine is absorbed systemically while smoking a cigarette [5], and studies performed using ¹⁴C-nicotine have shown that 80–90% of the inhaled nicotine is absorbed by the body [6]. Nicotine concentrations in the plasma can reach levels of approximately 15 ng/ml immediately after smoking and even higher levels in the saliva and gastric juice (>1300 and >800 ng/ml, respectively) [7]. Previous studies using a soft agar transforming assay and a xenografted nude mouse animal model have shown that non-cancerous human breast epithelial (MCF-10A) cells are transformed by either a cigarette smoke condensate or the tobacco-specific carcinogen 4-(methyl-nitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) [8, 9]. In vivo studies have demonstrated that nicotine promotes the growth of solid tumors, which suggests that it might contribute to the progression of cell proliferation, invasion, and

Materials and methods

Cell culture and patient samples

All of the human breast tumor samples $(n = 339)$ analyzed in this study were obtained as anonymous specimens from the Taipei Medical University Hospital and Cathay General Hospital, Taipei, according to a protocol approved by the Institutional Review Board (P950012). A histological evaluation revealed that all of the patient samples comprised >80% tumor tissue. Immunohistochemical staining-analysis of $\alpha$9-nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and p-c-Jun (Ser${}^{73}$) was performed using frozen sections from human primary breast tumors. Human mammary gland epithelial adenocarcinomas (MCF-7, MDA-MB-231) were obtained from the American Type Culture collection (ATCC numbers HTB 22 and HTB 26, respectively). MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells were grown and routinely maintained in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)/F12 supplemented with 10% (v/v) fetal bovine serum (FBS, Biological Industries, Israel), 2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 mg/ml streptomycin. The cells were incubated in a 37°C incubator with 5.0% CO${}_{2}$. Cell growth, proliferation, and viability were determined using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium (MTT) assay. Nicotine and estrogen (E2) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). Aqueous stock solutions of 10 mM nicotine and 10 nM E2 were prepared in sterile water and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), respectively.

For the kinase competition assays, the cells were treated with either 10 μM Ly294002, 25 μM PD98059, or 25 μM SP600125 (all from Tocris Cookson Inc., Ellisville, USA) before the treatment with nicotine or E2. All of the cell lines were grown in phenol red-free DMEM for 7 days before the experiments [28]. The DMEM medium used for these experiments contained 10% FBS that had been pre-treated with dextran-coated charcoal (0.5% Norit A and 0.05% Dextran T-70) to avoid the effects of serum-derived estrogenic compounds.

Biotechnology (Santa Cruz, CA, USA); anti-GAPDH, anti-$\alpha$9-nAChR, and anti-phospho ER$\alpha$ (Ser${}^{167}$) antibodies were obtained from ABcam (Cambridge, UK); anti-phospho Akt (Ser${}^{473}$, Thr${}^{308}$), anti-phospho c-Jun (Ser${}^{73}$), anti-phospho ER$\alpha$ (Ser${}^{118}$), and anti-phospho ER$\alpha$ (Ser${}^{104/106}$) antibodies were purchased from Cell Signaling Technology (Danvers, MA). Immunodetection was performed by probing membranes with the appropriate dilutions of specific primary antibodies at room temperature for 2 h. The membranes were then incubated at room temperature for 1 h with either alkaline phosphatase-coupled anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies that were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology. The specific protein complexes were identified by incubating the membranes with colorigenic substrates (nitroblue tetrazolium and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate; KPL, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland, USA). In each experiment, the membranes were also probed with an anti-GAPDH antibody as a protein loading control.

Reverse-transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and real-time PCR analysis

Total RNA was isolated from the acquired human cell lines using TRIzol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufacturer’s suggested protocol. Primers specific for the $\alpha$9-nAChR subunit (forward: 5′-gtccagggctcttgttttgt-3′ and reverse: 5′-atccgctcttgctatgat-3′) were synthesized by MB Mission BioTech (Taipei, Taiwan). The PCR amplicons were analyzed in 1.2% agarose gels (Amresco, Inc, Solon, Ohio, USA) that were stained with ethidium bromide. Because real-time RT-PCR is a powerful tool for the analysis of gene expression, our data were analyzed using $\beta$-glucuronidase (GUS) (forward: 5′-agtgttccctgctagaata-gatg-3′ and reverse: 5′-aaacagcccgtttacttgag-3′), which has been reported to be an ideal control gene with low variability [30], as a control to normalize the expression of the $\alpha$9-nAChR gene. For the real-time PCR analysis, a LightCycler thermocycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Mannheim, Germany) was used. The $\alpha$9-nAChR mRNA fluorescence intensity was measured and normalized to GUS expression levels using the built-in Roche Light-Cycler software (version 4).

Protein extraction, immunoblotting, and antibodies

Plasmid construction

Cell extracts were prepared as previously described [29]. Fifty micrograms of protein from each sample was resolved by 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, transferred to PVDF and analyzed by western blotting. The antibodies employed for the western blotting analysis were purchased from the following vendors: anti-Akt, anti-JNK, anti-phospho JNK, anti-estrogen receptor $\alpha$ (anti-ER$\alpha$), anti-c-Fos, anti-ERK1/2, anti-phospho ERK1/2, and protein A/G agarose beads were purchased from Santa Cruz

All of the $\alpha$9-nAChR promoter-luciferase gene fusions were constructed using a pGL3-Basic vector (Promega), and suitable $\alpha$9 promoter fragments were introduced into the polylinker region of the vector, upstream of the luciferase gene. These constructs were defined as pGL3($\alpha$9-nAChR). The fragments were generated using restriction enzymes and were either cloned directly into a pGL3-Basic
vector or first subcloned in a pBluescript vector and then transferred into a pGL3-Basic vector. Deletion analysis of the most promoter-proximal region was performed by generating either the appropriate restriction enzyme fragments or PCR fragments using full-length α9-nAChR sense (−995) and antisense (−1) oligonucleotide primers (ctgattggtcagccttga and cttttcctgagcctctat, respectively) that were designed to anneal to the pGL3-Basic vector downstream of the transcription initiation site.

### Luciferase activity assay

MCF-7 cells were plated in six-well plates and incubated overnight. The following day, the cells were transiently co-transfected with 2 μg of pGL3 (α9-nAChR) promoter plasmid and 500 ng of RLTK plasmid (Promega, Madison, WI) using a MP-100 microporator (Digital Bio, Seoul, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. After a 24-h incubation, the medium was replaced with culture medium containing either 10 or 0.1% FBS with or without nicotine and E2. Twenty-four hours later, the cells were lysed with 1× Reporter Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI) and stored at −20°C overnight. Luciferase activity was then determined by mixing 50 μl of the cell lysate and 50 μl of the Luciferase Assay Reagent (Promega). The total luciferase light units were quantified using a HIDEX Chameleon Microplate Reader. The relative luciferase activity was normalized to that of renilla luciferase in the same cell lysates. Each luciferase assay experiment was performed three times. In this study, the luciferase activity observed in cells transfected with the empty vector was defined as a onefold change (i.e., basal level). The α9-nAChR promoter serial deletion plasmids were synthesized by PCR using the following primers: forward primers −995 (ctgattggtcagccttga), −536 (ctggagatcatagaaccgtg), −260 (acaacagcactgttgacct), −139 (atgcaatgcaagcctgagct), and −41 (gctgcctgactgagacttta); and reverse primers −1 (cttttcctgagcctctata), −241 (aggtccaacagtgcgttgtt), and −22 (taaagtctcagtcaaggcago).

### Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay

ChIP assays using the cultured cells were performed as described previously [31]. In brief, after treatment of the cells with various doses of nicotine or E2 for varying periods, the cells were fixed with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde by its direct addition to the cell culture media at 25°C for 15 min. The crosslinking reaction was stopped by the addition of 0.125 M glycine for 5 min, and then the cells were collected in a new Eppendorf tube. The cell lysate was sonicated three times using 10-s bursts to yield input DNA that was enriched for fragments of approximately 1000 bp in size. ChIP assays were also performed using clinical tissue samples as described previously [32]. In brief, the samples were thawed in 500 μl of PBS containing protease inhibitors and homogenized three times on ice using a PRO 200 homogenizer (PRO Scientific Inc., Monroe, CT) at setting 3 (18000 rpm). After a mild centrifugation (1200 rpm) for 10 min, the samples were fixed with a final concentration of 1% formaldehyde solution at 25°C for 15 min.

ERα and p-c-Jun (Ser<sup>73</sup>) antibodies were used for the immunoprecipitation reactions. The α9-nAChR promoter was detected by targeting three different regions from −260, −536 and −995 to −1 by PCR (the sequences of the primers used are listed above). The pS2 promoter region was amplified from the −7 to −426 positions by PCR using a forward primer (ctctctgctccaaaggcga) and a reverse primer (tgagccactgttgtcacg). The PCR products were then detected by agarose gel electrophoresis.

### Laser-capture microdissection (LCM)

Sections stained with hematoxylin/eosin (H.E.) were subjected to LCM using a PixCell IIe system (Arcturus Engineering, Mountain View, CA) [33]. The parameters used for LCM included a laser diameter of 7.5 μm and a laser power of 48–65 mW. For each specimen, 15,000 laser pulse discharges were used to capture 10,000 morphologically normal epithelial cells or malignant cells. Each population was analyzed visually using a microscope to ensure that the captured cells were homogeneous. After the cells were captured, total RNA was isolated according to the manufacturer’s protocols. From the patient cohort, 12 tumor cell samples were obtained (ER+ and ER−, *n* = 6 per group). The α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels in the laser-capture microdissected cells were assessed by real-time PCR. The data obtained in these experiments represent the mean fold ratios determined in tumor/normal-paired samples from LCM-dissected cells with different clinical ER status criteria. Comparisons between the ER+ and ER− tissues were performed, and the data were analyzed using the Student’s *t*-test. All of the presented *P*-values are two-sided.

### Statistical methods

According to the REMARK criteria for tumor marker studies described in previous reports [34, 35], all of the data are expressed as the mean ± SD, and a univariate analysis was used to compare the α9-nAchR mRNA expression fold ratios detected in tumor/normal-paired
samples from surgical-dissected cells, which were compared according to age, 5-year survival, ER status, PR status, Her2/Neu expression, tumor size, nodal status, disease stage, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, tamoxifen, and herceptin usage. Differences in the tumor cell luciferase activity assays were analyzed using the Kruskal–Wallis (nonparametric) test. Kaplan–Meier curves and the log-rank test were used to evaluate differences in the 5-year overall survival rates. All the statistical comparisons were performed using SigmaPlot graphing software (San Jose, CA) and the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences v. 11.0.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL). A *P*-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant, and all of the statistical tests were two-sided.

**Results**

Expression of α9-nAChR in human breast tumor tissues and 5-year disease-specific survival rate

In a previous study, the authors demonstrated that the α9-nAChR subunit is important for nicotine-induced breast cancer cell formation [26]. The α9-nAChR subunit expression levels in 339 tumor versus normal-paired tissue samples were determined by real-time PCR analysis and correlated with clinical parameters (Table 1). We found that higher α9-nAChR expression levels were associated with significant differences in the disease stage (overall, *P* = 0.031), ER status (ER+ versus ER−, *P* = 0.045), Her2/neu status (Her2/neu+ versus Her2/neu−, *P* = 0.023), and 5-year survival (overall, *P* = 0.05) of breast cancer patients. Next, we explored the relationship between α9-nAChR expression levels and survival time after the surgical treatments. Fifty-five patients were followed up for an average of 5.5 years after surgery (ranging from 5 to 6 years). Among this population, 16 of the 55 patients (29%) had died of breast cancer. The 5-year disease-specific survival rate for the entire patient cohort was 71%. As shown in Fig. 1a, there was a significant association between the clinical stage and outcome (through stage I–IV, overall *P* = 0.009). Patients with stage IV breast cancer demonstrated the lowest 5-year survival rate (25%, dead/alive = 3/1, total = 4 patients, *P* = 0.04) compared with patients with stage I breast cancer (100%). The overall 5-year survival rates of patients with stage II and III breast cancer were 81.25% (dead/alive = 6/26, total = 32 patients, *P* = 0.365) and 62.5% (dead/alive = 6/10, total = 16 patients, *P* = 0.23), respectively (Fig. 1a).

As shown in Table 1, an increase in the expression of α9-nAChR mRNA in tumor versus normal tissue was detected in samples obtained from patients with advanced stages of breast cancer (mean fold ratios of 10.3 and 25.2 for stages III and IV, respectively), whereas α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels in tissue samples collected from patients with stage I breast cancer were only 3.1-fold higher than those detected in normal tissue (overall, *P* = 0.031). Next, we evaluated the 5-year disease-specific survival rates according to the α9-nAChR expression levels (Fig. 1b). Our results revealed a significant association between the α9-nAChR expression levels (mean fold ratios of the tumor/normal pairs) in tumor tissue and the 5-year disease-specific survival rates (overall, *P* = 0.009). High levels (i.e., mean fold ratios >10) of α9-nAChR expression in breast tumors were associated with the lowest 5-year disease-specific survival rate (50%, dead/alive = 4/4, total = 8 patients, *P* = 0.006) compared to the low levels (i.e., expression levels less than onefold higher than normal tissue) of α9-nAChR mRNA expression (88%, dead/alive = 3/22, total = 25 patients). Breast cancer patients that exhibited moderate increases in α9-nAChR expression levels (i.e., mean fold ratios >1 to ≤10) also presented a better survival rate (59%, dead/alive = 9/13, total = 22 patients, *P* = 0.034) in comparison to those with low levels of α9-nAChR expression.

Increased mRNA expression levels of α9-nAChR in ER+ breast tumor tissue

As shown in Table 1, we further tested whether the higher α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels detected in tumor tissues were associated with clinical diagnosis markers (i.e., ER, PR, and HER-2). The α9-nAChR mRNA mean fold ratios detected in ER+ tumor tissues were higher than those detected in ER− tumors tissues (ER+ versus ER−; *n* = 160 vs. 72; fold = 11 ± 3 vs. 6.7 ± 2.3, *P* = 0.045). To further confirm these observations, microdissected tumor and normal cell clusters were individually harvested by LCM from 12 different tumor samples (Fig. 1c, d, ER+ versus ER−, *n* = 6 per group). In agreement with our initial findings, an increase in the expression of α9-nAChR was preferentially detected in LCM-dissected ER+ tumor cells in comparison to ER− tumor cells (Fig. 1d, bars 1 versus 2, *P* = 0.001).

Effects of nicotine and E2 on breast cancer cell growth

To determine whether the signaling of nicotine or E2 via activation of their cognate receptors (α9-nAChR and ERα, respectively) was involved in cancer cell proliferation, cell growth proliferation assays were performed using breast cancer cells with or without ER expression

To test whether nicotine treatment affected the proliferation of these cell lines, cell growth curves were generated. The nicotine-induced cell growth curves were similar for both cell lines (Fig. 2c, d).

Nicotine- and E2-induced cell proliferation occurs through activation of the Akt signaling pathway in MCF-7 cells

Akt is activated via phosphorylation of either its serine (Ser<sup>473</sup>) or threonine (Thr<sup>308</sup>) residues by various upstream stimulatory factors [36]. To determine whether Akt activation is involved in nicotine-induced cell proliferation, MCF-7 cells were treated with nicotine (10 μM) in a time-dependent manner for immunoblotting analysis. Our results demonstrated that nicotine application significantly increased p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) expression in MCF-7 cells within 10 min of the treatment and caused a persistent increase in p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) expression for the duration of the experiment (Fig. 3a, lanes 3–8). Similarly, increased p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) protein levels were also detected in MCF-7 cells after 15 min of treatment with 10 nM E2 (Fig. 3a, lane 4). However, the E2-induced increase in p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) expression was down-regulated 120 min later (Fig. 3a, lane 8). Subsequently, we performed an experiment to examine the dose-dependent effects of nicotine and E2 on p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) protein expression levels in MCF-7 cells. Our results showed that the minimum concentrations of nicotine and E2 required for p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) induction within 15 min were 5 μM and 5 nM, respectively (Fig. 3b, lane 3). Next, we examined the combined effects of nicotine and E2 on Akt activation in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were treated with either nicotine (5 μM) alone, E2 (5 nM) alone, or both reagents for 15 min, and p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) was then detected by immunoblotting analysis. We found that the combined treatment with nicotine enhanced E2-induced Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) phosphorylation (Fig. 3c, lane 4).

Fig. 2 Effects of nicotine and E2 on the growth of human breast cancer cells. a, c MCF-7 and b, d MDA-MB-231 cells were cultured as described in "Materials and methods" and incubated with different concentrations of nicotine or E2 for 24 h. The cells were then counted using the MTT assay at an OD of 550 nM. All of the MTT assays were performed in triplicate

Nicotine and E2 activate MAP kinase, which phosphorylates ERα in MCF-7 cells

Previous studies have demonstrated that the up-regulation of PI3K/Akt signaling by E2 occurs through the activation of ERα but not ERβ [37]. In response to E2 binding, Ser<sup>104/106</sup> and Ser<sup>118</sup> are the primary ERα sites [38] that are phosphorylated by the ERK1/2 MAP kinase [39, 40]. However, ERα (Ser<sup>167</sup>) is the primary site of phosphorylation via the PI3-kinase/Akt pathway [41]. A recent study has suggested that ERα phosphorylation at these different phosphorylation sites can affect the survival of ER-positive breast cancer patients who are undergoing endocrine therapy [42]. Accordingly, the induction of ERα phosphorylation at different sites by carcinogenic factors (such as hormones and smoking) may play an important role in breast cancer formation.

To test this hypothesis, MCF-7 cells were pretreated with the PI3K inhibitor Ly 294002 (10 μM) for 30 min before an additional 30-min incubation in the presence or absence of either E2 (10 nM) or nicotine (10 μM). The results revealed that the pretreatment of cells with Ly 294002 almost completely abolished the nicotine-induced increase in p-Akt (Ser<sup>473</sup>) protein levels (Fig. 4a, lanes 3). However, the nicotine-induced ERα (Ser<sup>167</sup>) phosphorylation was inhibited to a lesser degree (Fig. 4a, lanes 3). These results suggested that nicotine-induced ERα (Ser<sup>167</sup>) phosphorylation was only partially induced via the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway. Furthermore, we demonstrated that ERK1/2 and JNK kinases were also activated by E2 treatment in breast cancer cells (Fig. 4b, c, lanes 4). Pretreatment of the cells with the specific MAPK inhibitors PD98059 and SP600125 almost completely abolished the E2-induced increase in p-ERK1/2 and p-JNK protein levels, respectively (Fig. 4b, c, lanes 5). These results indicated that the E2-induced activation of ERK1/2 and JNK kinases was also involved in ERα (Ser<sup>118</sup>) phosphorylation. To determine the minimum concentration of nicotine and E2 required for affecting the specific sites of ERα phosphorylation in MCF-7 cells, an immunoblotting analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 4d, ERα phosphorylation at Ser residues was easily detected in MCF-7 cells treated with concentrations of nicotine as low as 1 μM or concentrations of E2 as low as 1 nM at 30 min after drug treatment.

Nicotine- and E2-induced ER activates α9-nAChR gene transcription

As described above, higher α9-nAChR mRNA expression levels were preferentially detected in ER+ breast tumor tissues (Table 1; Fig. 1d). To investigate whether α9-nAChR gene expression is transcriptionally regulated by the ER, α9-nAChR mRNA/protein levels were detected in MCF-7 cells that were exposed to nicotine or E2 in a time-dependent manner. The results revealed that α9-nAChR mRNA and protein expression levels were significantly induced at 6 h post-treatment with nicotine (10 μM) or E2 (10 nM) (Fig. 5a).

Fig. 4 Akt and MAPK signaling kinases mediate ERα phosphorylation induced by nicotine and E2 in MCF-7 cells. MCF-7 cells were pretreated for 30 min with or without inhibitors specific for Akt and MAPK kinases, including a PI3K (LY294002, 10 μM), b ERK1/2 (PD98059, 25 μM), and c JNK (SP600125, 25 μM), and then with nicotine (10 μM) or E2 (10 nM) for an additional 30 min. After treatment, the cells were harvested for immunoblotting analysis. The p-ERα, total ER-α, and MAPK kinase proteins levels were detected by immunoblotting analysis. d MCF-7 cells were treated with nicotine (1–100 μM) or E2 (1–100 nM) for 30 min and then harvested for immunoblotting analysis. p-ERα and total ER-α protein levels were then detected

promoter in response to E2 and nicotine treatment. ChIP assays were performed using MCF-7 cells that had been treated with either E2 or nicotine. Our results demonstrated that the ER was directly bound to the α9-nAChR promoter region at three different locations (−260, −536 and −995

Fig. 5 ERs confer α9-nAChR transcriptional regulation by nicotine and E2 in MCF-7 cells. **a** MCF-7 cells were treated with nicotine (10 μM) or E2 (10 nM) in a time-dependent manner. After treatment, the cells were harvested, and α9-nAChR mRNA and protein expression levels were determined by RT-PCR and immunoblotting analyses. **b** MCF-7 cells were treated with nicotine or E2 for 6 h. After treatment, the cell lysates were harvested, and ER-bound DNA was precipitated using an ER-specific antibody for ChIP. PCR analysis was performed using three independent primer pairs targeting different regions of the α9-nAChR promoters; they were designed to amplify the regions from −260, −536 and −995 to −1. To determine whether the E2-induced recruitment of ERs was functionally sufficient to activate down-stream gene promoters (such as PS2), ChIP was performed using MCF-7 cells. The data are representative of three independent experiments that provided similar results. Genomic DNA isolated from MCF-7 cells was used as a positive input control (PC) to evaluate the PCR conditions. NC negative control. **c** Left panel A schematic representation of the α9-nAChR promoter region (−996/−1) illustrating the putative AP1 and VDR transcription factor-binding sites. Right panel MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with pGL3(α9-nAChR) and pRL-TK plasmids for 24 h before treatment with nicotine (10 μM) or E2 (10 nM) for an additional 24 h. Cell lysates were harvested, and relative firefly luciferase activities were measured and normalized to renilla luciferase activities in the same cell lysates. The luciferase activity in the cells transfected with vehicle plasmid (0.1% DMSO for E2 and ddH₂O for nicotine) were defined as a onefold change. Data were analyzed using paired *t*-tests; all *P*-values are two-sided. **d** MCF-7 cells were transiently transfected with either pGL3(AP1)5 or pGL3(mAP1)5 plasmid for 24 h and then treated with nicotine (0.1–10 μM) for an additional 6 h. The luciferase activity was assayed and normalized to the pRL-TK expression as described above. Cells treated with nicotine were compared to vehicle-treated controls (*P* = 0.009). The data were analyzed using nonparametric tests (Kruskal–Wallis and Mann–Whitney tests); all *P*-values are two-sided

to −1) after treatment with nicotine (>5 μM) or E2 (>5 nM) for 6 h (Fig. 5b). To test whether the E2-induced ER recruitment was functionally involved in down-stream gene promoter activation (as previously observed for PS2 [43], and in this study for α9-nAChR), ChIP was performed using MCF-7 cells. The results showed that both α9-nAChR and PS2 could be transcriptionally up-regulated by the ER through the direct binding of the receptor to its promoter target in response to E2 treatment (Fig. 5b). ERs can also act indirectly by altering the activities of other transcription factors (e.g., Sp1, AP1, or NF-κB) at their cognate sites on DNA [44]. Figure 5c shows the potential transcription factor response elements in the promoter regions of α9-nAChR, including two AP1 sites and one vitamin D receptor (VDR) site, which are responsive to ER binding [45].

To more precisely define the regulatory elements that are required by the α9-nAChR promoter for ER-induced transcriptional activation, transient-transfection experiments were conducted using a series of 5′ promoter deletion constructs in pGL3 vectors that were transfected into MCF-7 cells. Specific response elements in the α9-nAChR promoter were eliminated in the shorter constructs (Fig. 5c). In these experiments, the luciferase activity

observed in the cells that were transfected with the empty vector was defined as a onefold change (i.e., basal level). Experiments using the full-length construct demonstrated that the α9-nAChR promoter activity was significantly induced (greater than fourfold) by E2 (10 nM) or nicotine (10 μM) treatment after 24 h in MCF-7 cells (Fig. 5c, *P* < 0.05). In addition, the E2- and nicotine-induced responsiveness was preserved when a region of the promoter spanning positions –995 to –260 was deleted (Fig. 5c). In contrast, E2-induced luciferase activity was abolished when a region of the α9-nAChR promoter spanning positions –260 to –139 was deleted (*P* = 0.01). These results suggested that the E2-induced ER-responsive element was located at the VDR site (–181 to –167, sequence, asaggggaggGAGGgca) [46]. We further demonstrated that nicotine-induced luciferase activity was abolished when a region of the α9-nAChR promoter spanning positions –41 to –1 was deleted (*P* = 0.01), and the nicotine-induced ER-responsive element was suggested to be located at the AP1 site (–37 to –27, sequence, ccTGACtgaga) [47]. We next determined whether the AP1 DNA-binding sites that appeared in the α9-nAChR promoter were important for nicotine stimulation in MCF-7 cells. To explore this hypothesis, cells were transfected with pGL3(AP1)5, a luciferase reporter plasmid, which contains five repetitive AP1 DNA-binding sites from the α9-nAChR gene promoter (–37 and –27). The results demonstrated that nicotine increased the AP1-linked luciferase activity in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 5d, lanes 2–4). Mutated AP1 DNA-binding sequences were cloned into the luciferase reporter construct pGL3(mAP1)5 and transfected into MCF-7 cells as negative controls for the nicotine treatment (Fig. 5d, lanes 5–8).

### Effect of AP1 activation on the over-expression of α9-nAchR in breast cancer tissues

To test whether the over-expression of α9-nAChR in human breast tumor tissue was regulated by AP1, an immunohistochemical staining analysis was performed. As shown in Fig. 6a, positively stained cells (indicated by brown color) were simultaneously detected in serial sections of breast tumor tissue and revealed α9-nAChR protein expression in the cytosol (indicated by the green arrowhead). In contrast, active AP1 (c-Jun-p, Ser<sup>73</sup>) was found in the nuclear region (indicated by the red arrowhead). To test whether AP1 plays an important role in the transcriptional regulation of α9-nAChR protein expression, ChIP analysis was performed using samples from breast tumor patients with different ER statuses (*n* = 2 per group). Tumor and normal tissue lysates were harvested, and AP1-bound DNA complexes were precipitated using an activated AP1 (p-c-Jun, Ser<sup>73</sup>)-specific antibody for ChIP. The results demonstrated significant AP1 binding to the α9-nAchR promoter in ER+ tumor tissues in comparison to normal tissue (Fig. 6b, upper, lanes 2 and 4 versus 1 and 3). In contrast, the levels of AP1 binding to the α9-nAchR promoter were less profound in ER– tumor tissues (Fig. 6b, upper, lanes 6 and 8 versus 5 and 7). The samples used for the ChIP assay were also analyzed by real-time PCR (lower panel) to quantify the fold changes in AP1/α9-nAchR promoter-binding activity in ER+ tumor tissues in comparison to ER– tumor tissues, and a change of more than a four- to eightfold was detected (Fig. 6b, lower panel). To ascertain whether the ERs were affected by direct binding to their relevant ER-binding sites located in the α9-nAchR promoter (such as the VDR site spanning positions –181 to –167) or whether the binding was indirectly associated with AP1 followed by binding to the α9-nAchR promoter (such as the AP1 site spanning positions –36 to –26), immunoprecipitation was performed using an AP1 (c-Fos)-specific antibody followed by detection of the ER protein levels by immunoblotting analysis (Fig. 6c). Four randomized ER+ patients were selected, and an increased level of ER/AP1 complex formation was detected in tumor tissues in comparison to normal tissues (Fig. 6c, lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8 versus 1, 3, 5, and 7, respectively). The c-Fos and GAPDH protein levels were detected by immunoblotting analysis to ensure equal levels of protein loading.

#### Discussion

Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related death among women in the USA. In 2005, approximately 215,000 women were diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, 50,000 women were diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ, and 40,000 women died of invasive breast cancer [1]. Worldwide, it is estimated that more than one million women are diagnosed with breast cancer every year and that more than 410,000 will die from the disease [48]. Over the past two decades, however, the link between smoking and hormones (such as E2) has remained elusive [49, 50]. Some studies have suggested that there is little or no relationship between smoking and the incidence of female breast cancer [51]; however, other cohort and case–control studies have reported a positive association between cancer and smoking [52, 53]. Recently, two large cohort studies in the USA [54] and Japan [55] have reported an association between the risk for breast cancer and smoking. Both studies demonstrated that tobacco smoking was associated with a significantly increased risk for female breast cancer. Many factors should be considered when investigating the causative effect of smoking on the initiation of breast cancer, such as whether the smoking is active or passive, the age at which the patient starts smoking, the number of

Fig. 6 ER and AP1 confer α9-nAChR transcriptional regulation in human breast cancer tissues. **a** Activated AP1 (p-c-Jun, Ser<sup>73</sup>) and α9-nAChR were detected in the same regions of human invasive ductal and lobular carcinoma breast tumor tissues. Serial tumor tissue sections (5–7-μm thick) were stained with specific antibodies against human α9-nAChR (*left*, green arrowhead) and activated AP1 (p-c-Jun, Ser<sup>73</sup>) (*middle*, red arrowhead). The sections were stained with H.E. Scale bar = 200 μm. **b** ER+ or ER− human breast cancer patients were randomly selected (*n* = 2 per group). Tumor and normal tissue lysates were harvested, and AP1-bound DNA complexes were precipitated using an activated AP1 (p-c-Jun, Ser<sup>73</sup>)-specific antibody for ChIP. The RT-PCR data (*upper*) are representative of three independent experiments that provided similar results. The samples used for ChIP were also assayed by real-time PCR (*lower*) to obtain a quantitative analysis. Genomic DNA isolated from MCF-7 cells was used as a positive input control (PC) to evaluate the PCR conditions.

NC negative control; *N*, *T* normal and tumor tissues, respectively. **c** Direct interaction of ER and AP1 in breast tumor tissues. ER+ human breast cancer patients were randomly selected (*n* = 4). The tumor and normal tissues were dissected separately, and protein was harvested for immunoprecipitation using an AP1 (c-Fos)-specific antibody. Subsequently, the protein level of ER was assessed by immunoblotting analysis. The expression levels of both total c-Fos and GAPDH were detected by immunoblotting as protein loading controls. **d** Schematic representation of the α9-nAChR promoter region illustrating the putative ERα and AP1 transcription factor-binding sites. Our data demonstrated that both PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling were activated in human breast cancer cells following treatment with nicotine or E2. ERα was then activated via phosphorylation at the specific Ser residues, which conferred a central role of ERα in the transcriptional up-regulation of α9-nAChR mRNA expression in response to smoking- and hormone-induced breast carcinogenesis

cigarettes smoked, the duration of smoking, whether the patient is at specific stages of pregnancy, and the ethnicity of the patient [49, 53, 56–58]. A study with the goal of examining the link between smoking and breast cancer risk among 112,844 women aged 25–42 years was initiated in 1989, and the women were followed for 10 years. The results of that study suggested that there was a positive correlation between smoking and the development of breast cancer in patients with ER+ tumors [59]. This association was consistent over several smoking variables.

biological processes that may underlie the aggressive clinical outcomes observed for patients with tobacco-related cancers who continue to smoke. This study adds to previous nicotine and E2 studies by identifying α9-nAChR as a key cellular target of these chemicals in established breast cancer cells. The tobacco components that activate Akt through nAChRs have been observed in many bronchial and small airway epithelial cell systems that are relevant to lung cancer [63]. The dose- and time-dependent activation of Akt by nicotine and MAPK by E2 in breast cancer cells is similar to that observed in human lung epithelial cells [63]. Likewise, Akt activation in response to nicotine or NNK has also been observed in human breast cells during intermediate stages of the transformation process. Whereas tobacco carcinogens or steroid hormones can initiate and promote tumorigenesis in breast cells, the results of this study raise the possibility that exposure to either nicotine or E2 supplements may confer a proliferative advantage to breast tumors that are already established. Moreover, this hypothesis is supported by previous studies that have found that nicotine or E2 can prevent apoptosis induced by various agents; thus, these compounds confer a survival advantage in addition to a proliferative advantage to cells [64–67]. Taken together, these data indicate that human breast cells activate PI3K/Akt and MAPK signaling pathways in response to stimulation with nicotine or E2 in vitro. We believe that α9-nAChR not only functions as a calcium channel but also as a nicotine receptor that may function like a growth factor receptor in human breast cells via the mediation of signal transduction pathways. Elucidation of the signaling events that are mediated by α9-nAChR present on non-neuronal cells may open new research avenues for targeted cancer therapy, with a focus specifically on agents that inhibit the nicotine-induced PI3K/Akt or MAPK signaling pathways.
