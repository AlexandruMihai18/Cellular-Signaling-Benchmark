## Summary

The antigen 85 complex of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* consists of three abundantly secreted proteins. The recent characterization of a mycolyltransferase activity associated *in vitro* with each of these antigens suggested that they are potentially important for the building of the unusual cell envelope of mycobacteria. To define the physiological role of these proteins, the gene coding for antigen 85C was inactivated by transposon mutagenesis. The resulting mutant was shown to transfer 40% fewer mycolates to the cell wall with no change in the types of mycolates esterifying arabinogalactan or in the composition of non-covalently linked mycolates. As a consequence, the diffusion of the hydrophobic chenodeoxycholate and the hydrophilic glycerol, but not that of isoniazid, was found to be much faster through the cell envelope of the mutant than that of the parent strain. Taken together, these data demonstrate that: (i) antigen 85C is involved directly or indirectly in the transfer of mycolates onto the cell wall of the whole bacterium; (ii) the enzyme is not specific for a given type of mycolate; and (iii) the cell wall-linked mycolate layer may represent a barrier for the diffusion of small hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

## Introduction

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis*, the aetiological agent of tuberculosis, is a facultative intracellular pathogen which has the ability to survive and multiply inside macrophages. This important pathogen is surrounded by a complex envelope of unusually low permeability which contributes to its resistance to host defence mechanisms (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994; Daffé and Draper, 1998). Schematically, going from the cytoplasmic to the external side of the bacterium, the cell envelope is composed of a plasma membrane, a complex wall consisting of a variety of covalently linked and non-covalently linked carbohydrates and lipids, and a capsule of polysaccharides and proteins with small amounts of lipids (Daffé and Draper, 1998). The mycobacterial cell wall and capsule are typified by the presence of unusual long-chain fatty acids, the so-called mycolic acids, which are believed to play an important role in the structure of the cell wall (Minnikin, 1982) and to contribute to the resistance of mycobacteria to many therapeutic agents (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994). Considering the importance of the cell envelope structure for bacterial survival (Banerjee *et al.*, 1994; Belanger *et al.*, 1996), many attempts have been made to identify the enzymes involved in the metabolism of such specific compounds which obviously represent attractive targets for the design of new antimycobacterial drugs.

Among the increasing number of enzymes recently identified as being involved in the cell envelope biogenesis, the three dominant secreted proteins of *M. tuberculosis*, antigens 85A, B and C, have recently been suggested to play a role in the final assembly of cell envelope components. In an *in vitro* enzymatic assay, all three purified antigens catalyse the transfer of mycolates on trehalose, leading to the formation of α,α′-trehalose monomycolate (TMM) and α,α′-trehalose dimycolate (TDM, cord factor) (Belisle *et al.*, 1997). However, the activity of each of these enzymes in *M. tuberculosis*, and the reason for the existence of three enzymes apparently sharing the same substrate specificities, remains to be elucidated. These closely related enzymes (they share 68–80% identity at the amino-acid level) also exhibit antigenic properties. They interact with the immune system at an early stage of the infectious process and induce both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in patients infected by *M. tuberculosis*

1574 M. Jackson et al.

(Wiker and Harboe, 1992). An antigen 85A-based DNA vaccine demonstrated a level of protective immunity equivalent to that of the vaccine strain *M. bovis* BCG in a mouse model of tuberculosis (Huygen et al., 1996). The fibronectin-binding activity exhibited by all three 85 complex antigens suggests that they might also be involved in pathogenicity (Abou-Zeid et al., 1988; 1991). By conferring on mycobacteria the ability to bind fibronectin, these antigens could facilitate their entry into host cells (Wright et al., 1983; Hetland and Wiker, 1994) and promote their adherence to mucosal surfaces. Therefore, the construction of mutants of *M. tuberculosis* deficient in the synthesis of each of the three antigens should help to define what is the contribution of these major secretion products to the cell envelope biogenesis and to mycobacteria–host interactions.

During the course of a deliberate search for mutants deficient in the production of these secreted proteins, we isolated an antigen 85C-deficient mutant of *M. tuberculosis* from an ordered transposon mutagenesis library. The consequences of the inactivation of the 85C gene on the cell envelope structure and permeability of this mutant and on its subsequent survival inside macrophages were investigated.

### Results

#### Isolation of an antigen 85C-deficient mutant from an ordered transposon mutagenesis library of *M. tuberculosis*

The 6912 mutants from the ordered transposition library described in Experimental procedures were assembled in 72 pools, each pool corresponding to the assembly of the 96 mutants from one masterplate. After the extraction of the chromosomal DNAs from each of these pools, a PCR technique was devised to screen the 72 DNA preparations for the presence of transposon insertions inside the 85C gene. Two primers, αC1 and OP, were designed. αC1 corresponds to nucleotides 1–30 of the *M. tuberculosis* sequence deposited by Content et al. (1991) under the accession number X57229, and is located 150 bp upstream of the ATG start codon of the 85C gene (Fig. 1). OP is specific for the inverted repeats (IR) of IS1096 (with the exception of the first six bases at the 5′ end of the oligonucleotide which do not hybridize to the IR) and is directed outward from the transposon. Reasoning that only the DNA of mutants in which a transposon had inserted within a few kb (maximum 5–6 kb) of the αC1 primer would give an amplification product, we used these two primers to perform PCR reactions on each of the 72 pools of chromosomal DNA, as described in Experimental procedures. Because the OP primer is within the IR regions of IS1096, the use of the set of primers αC1/OP allows the amplification of a DNA fragment located between αC1 and the transposon insertion site, whatever the orientation of the transposon inside the chromosome.

Using this strategy, a single amplification product 320 bp long (product A, see Fig. 1) was obtained with pool number 35 (data not shown). The size of this PCR product was consistent with an insertion within the 85C gene coding region. To confirm this result, a second 85C-specific primer, αC2, was designed (Fig. 1). The PCR reaction

PCR products A and B are shown on a 1% agarose gel (MW = molecular weight marker; 1 kb ladder, Gibco BRL). The sequence analysis of the product A shows primers αC1 and OP, the 150 bp region upstream the 85C gene start codon (white box), the 85C gene start codon (ATG), the signal sequence (SS) of this gene (lined box) and the next 30 nucleotides. G is the first base of the transposon (see the text). KpnI is the restriction site used to produce the 85C probe (see Fig. 2) from the amplification product A.

performed on pool 35 DNA with primers αC2 and OP led to the amplification of a unique DNA fragment of the expected size (product B, 520 bp). Sequencing of the product A confirmed that the amplified 320 bp DNA fragment corresponded to the region extending from αC1 to the first 168 bp of the 85C gene coding sequence. Thus, the precise site of insertion of Tn5367 was located 10 amino acids below the signal sequence of the 85C gene (Fig. 1). The guanine residue (indicated in capital letters at the edge of OP in Fig. 1) was the first base of the transposon and was not carried by the OP oligonucleotide. Its presence instead of a cytosine residue expected from the 85C sequence was a further indication that transposition had occurred at this site, and that the product A was not the result of a non-specific amplification between primer OP and αC1.

A replica of the masterplate number 35 was made, and the 96 mutant cultures were grown for 4 weeks at 37°C. When PCR reactions were performed on each culture sample using the set of primers αC1/OP, only one amplification product of the expected size (320 bp) was obtained (data not shown). This allowed us to identify which of the 96 mutants was responsible for the amplification of product A in pool 35. This mutant (strain MYC1554) was further studied by Southern blot in order to check for the insertion

of the transposon Tn5367 inside the 85C gene. *M.* tuberculosis 103 (WT) and MYC1554 DNA were digested by the restriction enzyme BamHI, which cuts once inside the transposon (Figs 1 and 2), and probed for hybridization with probe 85C (Fig. 1) or with the entire transposon. Hybridization with probe 85C (Fig. 2A) showed that the 3.6 kb wild-type BamHI fragment carrying the 85C gene was disrupted in MYC1554. Hybridization with the entire transposon revealed two hybridizing signals on MYC1554 DNA (Fig. 2B), one of which could be superimposed on the hybridizing signal obtained with probe 85C. Thus, the 85C gene of MYC1554 is disrupted by a transposon insertion. The 85C gene, ORF Rv0129c in the Sanger sequence, is located 138 bp from Rv0128 and 247 bp from Rv0130, two ORF encoding putative proteins of unknown function (Cole et al., 1998). Thus, it is likely that the insertion of the transposon in the 85C gene which has an isolated position on the chromosome of *M.* tuberculosis will only affect the expression of this gene, but not that of adjacent genes.

Mt103 and MYC1554 exhibited the same apparent growth rate in both the synthetic Sauton medium and Middlebrook 7H9 medium, and examination of the colony morphology of Mt103 and MYC1554 showed that the mutation

did not affect the typical rough texture of the strains (data not shown).

Analysis of the protein profile of M. tuberculosis Mt103 and its antigen 85C-deficient mutant MYC1554 by two-dimensional electrophoresis and immunoblotting

To further confirm the disruption of the 85C gene in MYC1554, the production of the gene product in the culture filtrates from Mt103 and MYC1554 was investigated by 2D gel electrophoresis. As shown in Fig. 3, a protein spot migrating in the acidic part of the gel and corresponding to a protein of 32 kDa in size was found in the protein filtrate of Mt103 but not in that of MYC1554. That this spot corresponds to that of a member of the antigen 85 complex was demonstrated by Western blot analysis using a rabbit antiserum raised against the 85 complex (data not shown). The position of this spot on the gel identified the corresponding protein as 85C antigen (Ohara *et al.*, 1995). The presence of two forms of the antigen 85A has previously been described (Ohara *et al.*, 1995) and might be the result of post-translational modifications other than the addition of carbohydrates and lipids (Harth *et al.*, 1996). No other qualitative differences in the overall protein composition of Mt103 and MYC1554 culture filtrate proteins were observed on silver stained 2D gels, even when higher quantities of protein material (30–45 μg) were loaded (data not shown). It follows then that the disruption of the 85C gene resulted, as expected, in the lack of production of the 85C protein. Furthermore, no obvious quantitative difference was seen by SDS–PAGE and Western blot analysis between the various polypeptides, including antigens

85A and B secreted by Mt103 and MYC1554 (data not shown). This observation is consistent with the comparable amounts of proteins secreted by the two strains into their culture medium (45 ± 2 μg ml⁻¹ of culture medium per gram of bacterial cell dry weight). In addition, the enzyme profiles of the culture filtrates (Raynaud *et al.*, 1998) were also identical.

Lipid composition of M. tuberculosis Mt103 and MYC1554

To address the question of the effects of the disruption of the antigen 85C gene on the cell envelope, we first compared the nature and the relative amounts of the different forms of mycolate-containing extractable lipids from Mt103 and its isogenic mutant. To easily quantify these lipids, bacterial cells were labelled with [¹⁴C]-methionine, a molecule known to be incorporated in methyl-branched and cyclopropanated lipids of mycobacteria, notably tuberculostearate (10-methyl octadecanoate) and mycolates. We analysed the lipid composition of the two strains using both the unfractionated crude extracts and the fractions resulting from either the differential precipitation with cold methanol or chromatography as well as their saponification products. Because the lipid content, including mycolates, is known to vary with growth phase of a given culture, the comparative lipid analyses were performed on cells from Mt103 and 1554 which were harvested in the same growth phase.

Lipids extracted by organic solvents from both Mt103 and MYC1554 represented 20 ± 4% of the bacterial dry weights (three independent experiments); comparable values were obtained for *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv (23 ± 2%) grown in the same experimental conditions. No significant difference was observed between the two isogenic strains in terms of nature and relative amounts of the different classes of major extractable lipids examined, notably the mycolate-containing lipids (Table 1). In addition, comparative radiolabelling of lipids from both strains demonstrated no drastic difference in terms of incorporation of the radiomarker (specific radioactivity) in the extractable lipids from Mt103 and MYC1554 (data not shown), suggesting that lipid synthesis was not primarily affected by the mutation. TDM and TMM from both strains exhibited the expected structures (data not shown). Glycerol mycolate was the major mycolate-containing extractable lipid in both young and old cultures (Table 1). No free mycolic acid was present in detectable amounts in the lipid extracts analysed.

Analysis of the saponification products of the crude lipid extracts to identify the various ester-linked fatty acid residues showed no difference between the two strains. The gas chromatographic profile of their fatty methyl esters was similar to that of H37Rv (Daffé *et al.*, 1983); TLC analysis of the mycolate profiles of extractable lipids demonstrated the occurrence in both strains of the three types

Because the relative percentages of the various classes of lipids and types of mycolates are known to vary according to the growth phases, the values shown correspond to a representative experiment of 5-week-grown bacteria.

of mycolates elaborated by *M. tuberculosis* and some other slow-growing mycobacterial species (Daffe et al., 1983), namely types I (α-mycolate), III (methoxymycolates) and IV (ketomycolates) as illustrated in Fig. 4. No obvious difference was observed between the relative percentages of the three types of mycolates from the two strains as determined by the incorporation of \[^{14}C\]-methionine (Table 1). Analysis of the mycolates by mass spectro- meter demonstrated that the molecules were essentially cyclopropanated and released C₂₆ by pyrolysis (Toubiana et al., 1978). These results suggest that the disruption of the antigen 85C gene does not induce major changes in the composition of bacterial extractable lipids. In addition, no accumulation of potential precursors or degradative products of mycolates was observed in the bacterial cells and no release of such compounds into the growth medium was found.

Analysis of the cell wall-linked mycolates of M. tuberculosis Mt103 and MYC1554

Because mycolates occur principally as esters covalently linked to the cell wall arabinogalactan (Daffe and Draper, 1998), the covalently linked cell wall lipids were analysed. Saponification of organic solvent-extracted cells from Mt103 and MYC1554, followed by the analysis of the resulting lipids by TLC showed that the latter consisted exclusively of the three types of mycolates previously found in the extractable lipids (Fig. 4); these mycolates occurred in relatively similar proportions in the cell walls of the two strains (Table 1). Interestingly, a difference of 40 ± 2% was invariably found between the mycolate content of the wild-type *M. tuberculosis* and its isogenic mutant (three replicates), independent of the age of the cultures (3–6 weeks); mycolates represented 10.3 ± 0.4% and 6.4 ± 1.0% (mean values of three replicates) of the cell wall dry weight of

Mt103 and MYC1554 respectively; the mycolate content of the cell walls of the H37Rv strain of *M. tuberculosis* was similar to that of Mt103. Taken together, the data obtained from the lipid analysis suggest that the 85C protein is, in the whole bacterium, directly or indirectly involved in the transfer of mycolates on arabinogalactan. As the antigen 85C deficiency of the MYC1554 strain affects the transfer on arabinogalactan of α-, methoxy- and ketomycolates in equal proportions (Table 1), it can be assumed that the transfer activity of the antigen 85C enzyme is not restricted to one particular type of mycolic acid.

**Cell wall permeability of M. tuberculosis Mt103 and MYC1554**

The intrinsic resistance of mycobacteria to most antibiotics and chemotherapeutic agents is believed to be a result of their unusual cell wall structure (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994). Although members of Gram-positive bacteria, they share with Gram-negative bacteria the property of forming in their envelopes a virtually impermeable outer layer that is distinct from the plasma membrane (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994; Daffé and Draper, 1998; Draper, 1998). Although this additional barrier in Gram-negative microorganisms is a typical bilayer of phospholipid and lipopolysaccharide, evidence that in mycobacteria the barrier consists of a monolayer of highly hydrophobic C-70 to -90 mycolyl residues covalently linked to the cell wall arabinogalactan and possibly other lipids has been published (George *et al.*, 1995; Liu *et al.*, 1995; 1996). This would result in the low diffusion of lipophilic molecules through the outer barrier which is of abnormal thickness and unusually low fluidity (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994). In addition, although mycobacteria presumably solved the problem of the existence of this outer barrier for obtaining a supply of small hydrophilic nutrients by producing protein with pore-forming ability (Trias *et al.*, 1992; Trias and Benz, 1994; Mukhopadhyay *et al.*, 1997; Senaratne *et al.*, 1998), their cell envelopes possess a very low permeability to polar molecules such as β-lactam antibiotics, 100–1000 times lower than that of *Escherichia coli* (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1990; Chambers *et al.*, 1995), thereby potentially causing a slow diffusion of hydrophilic compounds across the cell wall. We, thus, took advantage of having a mycobacterial mutant strain lacking 40% of cell wall mycolates, compared with the parent strain, to address the question of the permeability of the mycolate barrier of Mt103 and MYC1554 by studying the accumulation of the hydrophobic chenodeoxycholate, the hydrophilic glycerol commonly used as a substrate for mycobacterial growth, and the water-soluble anti-tuberculosis drug isoniazid (INH).

The uptake of chenodeoxycholate by the two isogenic strains of *M. tuberculosis* was first investigated. This molecule is a negatively charged hydrophobic probe that diffuses through lipid domains and has been previously used to evaluate the fluidity of the mycobacterial cell wall lipids (Liu *et al.*, 1996; Yuan *et al.*, 1997). As expected from the barrier property of the outer cell compartment of mycobacteria, the accumulation of the probe by the mycolate-deficient strain MYC1554 greatly differed from that of the parent strain Mt103 (Fig. 5A). The mutant showed significantly higher initial rate of uptake of the compound than Mt103. This result was consistent with the marked defect of MYC1554 in its cell wall mycolate content.

To evaluate the implication of cell wall mycolates in the permeability of hydrophilic molecules through the outer barrier, the uptake of glycerol by the two strains was compared. As shown in Fig. 5B, a profound difference was also observed between the two isogenic strains in terms of initial

![Figure 5](#fig5)

uptake of glycerol. The same differences were observed in the presence of arsenate, an inhibitor of the production of ATP (Prasad et al., 1976), demonstrating that the phenomenon was independent of the subsequent metabolism of the substrate (data not shown) and that the diffusion of glycerol through the outer envelope in the parent strain is a limiting step. As expected from the inhibition of the production of ATP, a reduction of the accumulation of glycerol by both strains was observed in arsenate-treated cells after 25 min, due to the inhibition of glycerol metabolism. Thus, at least portions of the glycerol molecules penetrate the mycobacterial cell wall through the lipid domains, a result consistent with the data obtained on liposomes used as a model for hydrophobic bilayers (Fig. 6B).

The mycobacterial cell envelope may also represent a permeability barrier for the transport of INH because the rate of transport of INH across the cell permeability barrier in both *M. tuberculosis* and *M. avium* has recently been reported (Mdluli et al., 1998) to be slightly lower than that observed in *M. tuberculosis* for the transport of β-lactam antibiotics (Chambers et al., 1995). To determine whether the cell wall-linked mycolates represent a barrier in the transport of this specific antituberculous drug through the mycobacterial cell envelope, the accumulation of \[^{14}C\]-INH by Mt103 and MYC1554 was investigated. As shown in Fig. 6A, no significant difference was observed between the uptake of the drug between the two isogenic strains, showing that the transport of INH was not affected by the mutation and that the diffusion of INH through the mycolate layer is not the limiting step of the drug entry in *M. tuberculosis*. It has been recently shown that INH enters *M. tuberculosis* cells through passive diffusion (Bardou et al., 1998). Thus, the observed lack of contribution of the mycolate layer in the transport of INH could be explained by either a diffusion of INH through the recently characterized porin-like OmpATb of *M. tuberculosis* (Senaratne et al., 1998) or, alternatively, by the potential intrinsic high diffusion of the molecule through membranes. INH is a small water-soluble molecule which is not ionized between pH 6 and pH 9 (Krüger-Thiemer, 1956), two properties that confer upon INH a good diffusibility through cell barriers. Thus, this possibility was tested by comparing the diffusion of INH and glycerol through liposomes made from phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylglycerol. As shown in Fig. 6B, liposomes were highly permeable to INH and the initial diffusion rate of the molecule was found to be significantly greater (fourfold) than that of glycerol. Interestingly, in the entire cells of Mt103, the same ratio was observed between the initial velocity of INH uptake (Fig. 6A) and that of glycerol (Fig. 5B) (0.4 and 0.1 pmol mg⁻¹ min⁻¹ respectively). Thus, these data indicate that INH may penetrate the mycolate layer in a manner similar to that of the phospholipid bilayer. As the presence of OmpATb in liposomes did not affect the diffusion of INH through liposomes (Draper,

![Figure 6](#fig-6)

A. The accumulation of \[^{14}C\]-NH (1.4 × 10⁻⁴ M, 0.48 GBq mmol⁻¹) was measured in Mt103 (filled symbols) and MYC1554 (open squares).

B. INH diffusion in multilayered liposomes: the liposome swelling assays was assayed in isotonic solutions (25 mM) of INH using sucrose as a negative control (negligible diffusion) and glycerol as a positive reference for diffusion (very hydrophilic small molecule). A decrease in OD at 450 nm corresponds to swelling of the vesicles. The slight irregularity in the plots is attributable to instrument noise.

1998), these data strongly suggest that the similar uptake of INH by the two strains of *M. tuberculosis* is the result of its high diffusion rate through the cell wall mycolate barrier. As expected, the complex mycobacterial cell envelope which includes a capsule of protein/carbohydrate matrix and the plasma membrane still hinders the diffusion of INH because the rate of conversion of INH in intact *M. tuberculosis* and *M. avium* was found to be significantly slower than the rate in cell homogenates (Mdluli et al., 1998).

**Effect of the inactivation of the antigen 85C gene on drug susceptibility**

To examine further the consequence of the defect in the

cell wall mycolate content, we investigated the sensitivity of MYC1554 and its parent to various antibiotics which presumably enter bacteria to achieve their inhibitory action. As expected from the comparable uptake of INH by the two isogenic strains (Fig. 6A), the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of INH (0.05 μg ml⁻¹) was unaltered by the inactivation of the antigen 85C gene, a phenomenon also observed with the other hydrophilic molecules tested: ethambutol (0.05 μg ml⁻¹) and pyrazinamide (16 μg ml⁻¹) and streptomycin (1.0 μg ml⁻¹). The MIC of the different relatively hydrophobic molecules examined was also unaffected by the mutation; these included rifampicin (0.25 μg ml⁻¹) and various quinolones: ciprofloxacin (1.0 μg ml⁻¹), norfloxacin (5.0 μg ml⁻¹) and ofloxacin (1.0 μg ml⁻¹). These data suggest that the diffusion of these antibiotics through the mycolate layer was not the limiting step for their activity.

**Survival of the M. tuberculosis Mt103 and MYC1554 inside macrophages**

Mt103 and MYC1554 exhibited the same apparent growth rate in both the synthetic Sauton medium and the Middlebrook 7H9 medium, suggesting that a 40% decrease in the cell wall mycolate content does not affect *M. tuberculosis* growth in these media. We further investigated whether the modification of cell envelope composition of the mutant affects its survival within macrophages. BALB/c bone marrow-derived mouse macrophages were infected for 18 h with MYC1554 or Mt103 at a multiplicity of infection of 1:1. Intracellular bacteria were recovered on days 1, 4, 7 and 11 after infection by lysing the macrophages and were plated onto agar plates to estimate the number of cfu. Acid-fast staining of bacilli showed that both Mt103- and MYC1554-infected macrophages started to undergo extensive lysis from day 11. Thus, the experiment was not carried out after this time point. Because no lysis was observed in non-infected macrophages, the lysis of infected cultures was certainly due to the bacterial intracellular growth. As shown in Fig. 7, no significant difference was observed between the intracellular growth of the MYC1554 mutant within macrophages and that of the wild-type Mt103. This result suggests that MYC1554, despite the profound modification of its cell envelope composition, is not affected in its intracellular replication and survival.

**Discussion**

Mycolic acids, the hallmark of mycobacteria and the class of mycobacterial substances that has stimulated the greatest amount of interest since their discovery some 50 years ago (Goren and Brennan, 1979), remain a major subject of active research in the context of the resurgence of tuberculosis and emergence of multidrug-resistant mycobacteria.

Fig. 7. Growth of Mt103 and MYC1554 in mouse bone marrow macrophages. Macrophages were infected (multiplicity of infection: 1:1) with Mt103 (filled symbols) and MYC1554 (open squares). At days 1, 4, 7 and 11, intracellular bacteria were recovered and plated on agar plates for bacterial counts. For both strains, the values indicated are the means of four cfu counts performed on four infected wells. Standard deviations (±) of the means are indicated.

These α-branched β-hydroxylated long-chain fatty acids play a central role in the cell envelope architecture of mycobacteria (Minnikin, 1982; Jarlier and Nikaido, 1994; Daffé and Draper, 1998;). Such emphasis is unquestionably related to the necessity of the development of new antituberculosis drugs. The full definition of the metabolic pathway leading to these substances may provide novel specific targets for chemotherapy. Despite the extensive literature on mycolic acids, precise information, especially in the field of the biogenesis and traffic of these molecules and on their relative importance in the cell envelope architecture and function, is still lacking.

Recently, the antigens 85 secreted by *M. tuberculosis* (85A, B and C) were associated with a mycoloyl transferase activity (Belisle et al., 1997). Although the three proteins have been shown to catalyse *in vitro* the transfer of mycolates onto trehalose, several fundamental questions remain to be addressed. For instance, it is not known whether or not antigens 85 have a mycoloyl transferase activity in the whole bacterium, or what is their natural mycolate donor or acceptor, i.e. trehalose, glycerol or/and arabinogalactan (for a review, see Daffé and Draper, 1998). Indeed, it has been shown that the use of a trehalose analogue which inhibits *in vitro* up to 60% of the antigen 85C mycoloyl transferase activity also suppresses the growth of *M. aurum* and inhibits to a certain extent the synthesis of trehalose mycolates and cell-bound mycolates in this bacterium (Belisle et al., 1997). However, the direct implication of antigens 85 in the observed inhibitions remained to be established. Similarly, the enzyme specificity for the

three types of mycolates synthesized by *M. tuberculosis* in the whole bacterium (Daffé *et al.*, 1983) was not known. Thanks to the recent development of insertional mutagenesis systems for mycobacteria of the *M. tuberculosis* complex (Pelicic *et al.*, 1997), we constructed an ordered transposition library of 6912 mutants from a clinical isolate of *M. tuberculosis* (Mt103). A deliberate search for antigen 85C-deficient mutants from this library by a PCR-based methodology led to the isolation of MYC1554. This antigen 85C-deficient mutant was used to address some of the questions related to the transfer of mycolates.

By analysing the non-covalently bound lipids, we were unable to find any difference between MYC1554 and its parental strain, both in terms of the nature and of the amount of the different major classes of the extracted lipids including trehalose mycolates which are the final products of the reaction catalysed by antigens 85 *in vitro* (Belisle *et al.*, 1997). This result is surprising and in apparent conflict with the *in vitro* assays. An obvious explanation of this discrepancy may reside in the fact that the antigen 85C enzyme esterifies *in vitro* a broad range of molecules, including trehalose, whereas in the whole bacterium its natural substrates may be different. A second possibility exists in the assumption that the remaining active antigens 85A and B compensate the lack of antigen 85C in MYC1554. To test these hypotheses, we further analysed the cell wall-bound mycolates. Examination of these lipids demonstrated that the antigen 85C-deficient mutant invariably contains 40% less cell wall-bound mycolates than its parent strain. Thus, our results confirm the mycolyl transferase activity described for antigen 85C *in vitro* and demonstrate that, in the whole bacterium, antigen 85C is one of the enzymes involved in the transfer of mycolyl residues on the cell wall arabinogalactan. Whether or not antigen 85C is directly involved in this reaction remains an open question. Based on the absence of accumulation of potential intermediates in MYC1554, including trehalose mycolates, and on the identical composition of mycolate-containing extractable lipids in MYC1554 and Mt103, we favour the direct participation of antigen 85C in the deposition of mycolyl residues on arabinogalactan but not on trehalose and glycerol.

The occurrence in mycobacteria of three different homologous genes coding for three mycolyl transferases of the antigen 85 family poses the question of the specificity of these enzymes for both the different types of mycolates and the mycolate acceptor. By analysing the mycolate profiles of cell wall-bound materials from Mt103 and MYC1554, it appeared that the mycolate profile of the antigen 85C-deficient mutant was superimposable on that of its parent, both in terms of type and proportion of mycolates present on arabinogalactan. Thus, the transfer activity of the antigens 85 does not seem to be restricted to one specific type of mycolic acid. This assumption is in accordance

with the work of Sathyamoorthy and Takayama (1987), who showed that *in vitro* the replacement of the mycoloyl group by a palmitoyl group in trehalose monomycolate did not affect the enzymatic activity of the purified trehalose mycoloyl transferase later shown to coincide with antigens 85 (Belisle *et al.*, 1997).

Regarding the mycoloyl acceptor, because 40% of the cell-bound mycolates are lacking in MYC1554, it appears that the 85A and 85B proteins are not able to compensate all of the 85C activity. Whether this lack of compensation is attributable to an amount of antigens 85A and B insufficient to transfer the remaining 40% mycolates or the result of a difference in the substrate specificity of the three enzymes cannot be concluded from our results. It should be mentioned that a differential expression of antigens 85A and 85C has been observed after the exposure of *M. tuberculosis* to both INH and ethionamide (Garbe *et al.*, 1996), two antituberculous drugs believed to affect mycolate synthesis in mycobacteria (Winder, 1982; Quémard *et al.*, 1992; Banerjee *et al.*, 1994). As no obvious upregulation of the production of the antigens 85A and 85B in the absence of 85C was observed, the upregulation of the production of the antigens 85A and 85C after the exposure of *M. tuberculosis* to INH and ethionamide was probably due to the inhibition of mycolate synthesis rather than the transfer of mycoloyl residues. As far as the mycoloyl transferase activity on arabinogalactan is concerned, however, our data suggest a non-redundance of the three enzymes. The observed 60% transfer of mycolates on arabinogalactan in MYC1554 could then be the result of other mycoloyl transferases activities, independent of those exhibited by the 85 complex enzymes. The extensive primary structure similarity of the MPT51 antigen to that of the antigens 85 (Ohara *et al.*, 1995) and the cross-reactivity of polyclonal anti85 complex antibodies with other proteins such as MPT51 and the 33 kDa antigen supports the existence of such antigens 85-resembling mycoloyl transferases. Studies of antigen 85A- and 85B-deficient mutants is warranted to gain more insights into the enzymatic specificities of the three 85 complex proteins.

Evidence that mycobacterial cell wall-linked mycolates and other lipids are arranged to form an impermeable outer bilayer that is distinct from the plasma membrane has been presented (George *et al.*, 1995; Liu *et al.*, 1995; 1996). The inner leaflet of this asymmetric bilayer would be composed of closely packed mycolate residues whereas the outer leaflet would contain extractable lipids (Minnikin, 1982). In agreement with this view, Nikaido *et al.* (1995) have pointed out that the amount of cell wall-linked mycolates from *M. bovis* (0.085 μmol of mycolic acids per 1 mg bacterial dry weight) is more than sufficient to form a monolayer which would cover the 230 cm² cell surface area. In the case of the two strains Mt103 and H37Rv of *M. tuberculosis* examined in the present study, the amounts

1582 M. Jackson et al.

of cell wall-bound mycolates are also enough to cover the 230 cm² cell surface area (for calculations, see Nikaido *et al.*, 1995 and the quoted references therein). The 10% (dry weight) cell wall-linked 1200 Da mycolates correspond to 0.086 μmol mycolic acids mg⁻¹ (dry weight) of cells, an amount which would cover about 243 cm² of cell surface and presumably form a monolayer of mycolate (see Nikaido *et al.*, 1995). In contrast, and because of the mutation, the amount of cell wall-linked mycolates of MYC1554 would cover only 146 cm² and, as shown herein, the 40% decrease in the MYC1554 cell wall mycolate content induces a profound effect on the outer cell envelope permeability of the mutant for the hydrophobic chenodeoxycholate, as expected. It should be noted, however, that this change in the cell wall-linked mycolate content has no visible effect on the growth rate of the mutant in synthetic media and within mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages.

The occurrence of an outer mycolate permeability barrier could hinder the access of hydrophilic molecules to the mycobacterial interior. Comparison of rates of permeation of the mycobacterial cell envelopes and those of Gram-negative organisms using various β-lactam drugs with a range of hydrophilicities led to the conclusion that mycobacteria are much less permeable (100–1000 times) than *E. coli* (Jarlier and Nikaido, 1990; Chambers *et al.*, 1995). Consistent with this observation is the subsequent characterization of porin-like proteins in mycobacteria, including *M. tuberculosis* (Trias *et al.*, 1992; Trias and Benz, 1994; Mukhopadhyay *et al.*, 1997; Senaratne *et al.*, 1998). Although the recently characterized OmpA-like protein of *M. tuberculosis*, OmpATb (Senaratne *et al.*, 1998), exhibits a low specific activity, as do other mycobacterial porin-like molecules, it would allow the diffusion of small hydrophilic compounds such as glycerol through the outer cell envelope barrier of *M. tuberculosis*. As demonstrated in the present study, the mycolate layer functions as a barrier for the diffusion of highly hydrophilic glycerol, indicating that at least portions of the glycerol molecules diffuse though the lipid barrier. This observation may be explained by (i) the demonstrated low activity of OmpATb (Senaratne *et al.*, 1998), (ii) the estimated small amount of the proteins in the cell walls of some mycobacteria (Trias *et al.*, 1992) or (iii) the combined phenomena.

This outer mycolate layer may not, however, represent an impermeable barrier for all small molecules. In addition to small compounds that enter the cells through OmpATb and possibly other porin-like proteins of *M. tuberculosis*, a route independent of the mycolate barrier, we showed that highly diffusible molecules such as INH are not concerned by the cell wall mycolate barrier and do not need the porin pathway to gain entry into the cells because no difference was found in the accumulation of this molecule by the two isogenic strains of *M. tuberculosis* and it is not possible to measure any difference in diffusion rate when OmpATb

was incorporated into liposomes (Draper, 1998). A similar high diffusion rate through lipid bilayers in liposomes was observed with another anti-tuberculosis drug, pyrazinamide (C. Raynaud, M.-A. Lanéelle, G. Lanéelle and M. Daffé, unpublished). It has to be noted that the altered cell envelope composition of the antigen 85C-deficient mutant of *M. tuberculosis* had no effect on the MIC of most hydrophobic and hydrophilic antibiotics tested.

In connection with the permeability barrier, mycolates have been suggested as representing a barrier to the export of secreted proteins in view of the overproduction of these proteins after the action of INH on *M. aurum* and *M. tuberculosis* (Bardou *et al.*, 1996), primarily because this overproduction was associated with a 20% decrease in the cell wall mycolate content. In the present study, no quantitative difference was found between the amount of proteins secreted by Mt103 and its isogenic mutant. Because the 40% decrease of the mycolate content of *M. tuberculosis* does not induce the oversecretion of proteins by MYC1554, it follows then that this previously observed phenomenon in the presence of INH was probably not due to the decrease of the mycolate content of the bacterial cell wall. The overproduction of secreted proteins may be explained either by a concomitant inhibition by the drug of the synthesis of non-covalently linked mycolate-containing lipids or, alternatively, by a mechanism other than that related to mycolate metabolism.

Finally, the use of a competitive inhibitor of trehalose, which partially inhibits the enzyme activity of antigen 85C in vitro and has a bacteriostatic action on *M. aurum*, has demonstrated the potential interest of the 85 complex proteins as possible targets for new anti-tuberculosis drugs (Belisle *et al.*, 1997). The fact that antigens 85 have been identified in the secreted products and the cell envelopes of all the mycobacterial species examined so far further supports the above assumption. However, as in the case of INH and mycolate biosynthesis, and from the data presented in this report, it is not clear whether the action of the trehalose analogue described above is directly linked to the inhibition of mycolates transfer or is the consequence of the inhibition of another important metabolism. Indeed, from the results presented here, it is established that a 40% decrease of the cell wall-bound mycolate content does not affect *M. tuberculosis* extra- and intracellular growth. Thus, our data point out the necessity for an antimycobacterial drug directed against the antigens 85 to target at least two of these proteins because the disruption of the only antigen 85C gene is not sufficient to affect *M. tuberculosis* survival.

## Experimental procedures

### Bacterial strains and culture conditions

*Mycobacterium tuberculosis* 103 (Mt103), the wild-type *M.*

© 1999 Blackwell Science Ltd, *Molecular Microbiology*, **31**, 1573–1587
tuberculosis strain used in this study, was isolated from a tuberculous patient. Wild-type Mt103 and the 85C antigen-deficient *M. tuberculosis* mutant (MYC1554) were grown on liquid Sauton medium (Sauton, 1912) as surface pellicles, Middlebrook 7H9 medium (Difco) supplemented with 0.05% Tween 80 and ADC (0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.0003% beef catalase), or on solid Middlebrook 7H10 medium (Difco) supplemented with OADC (0.005% oleic acid, 0.2% dextrose, 0.5% bovine serum albumin fraction V, 0.085% NaCl, 0.0003% beef catalase). Kanamycin (Km) was added when required at a concentration of $20 \mu\mathrm{g} \mathrm{ml}^{-1}$. *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv (ATCC 27294) was used as the reference strain. Strains were inoculated by loop (roughly 10 mg wet bacteria) into 100 ml Sauton medium in a 250 ml flask and incubated at $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ as surface pellicles for 3–6 weeks.

### Construction of an ordered *M. tuberculosis* transposon mutagenesis library

Two different IS1096 derivatives, Tn5367 and Tn5368 (McAdam et al., 1995), were cloned into the pPR27 delivery vector (Pelicic et al., 1997), giving a series of mutagenesis vectors which were introduced into Mt103 by electroporation. *M. tuberculosis* transformants selected at $32^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ on 7H10 plates containing Km were grown in 7H9-Km at $32^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ until saturation. Insertional mutants, in which Tn5367 or Tn5368 have transposed onto the chromosome, were selected at $39^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ on 7H10 plates containing Km and 2% sucrose as described by Pelicic et al. (1997). Six thousand nine hundred and twelve mutants were inoculated independently in $100 \mu\mathrm{l}$ of 7H9-Km in 96-well microplates (72 microplates in total) and incubated at $37^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in a $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ atmosphere for 3 weeks. Glycerol was then added to a final concentration of 15% in each well and the microplates were kept frozen at $-20^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ (masterplates).

### PCR amplifications

PCR amplifications were carried out in a GenAmp PCR system 9600 (Perkin-Elmer). Primers were $\alpha$C1 ($5^{\prime}$-AGGTGTCCGGGCCGACGCTGAATCGTTAGC-3′), $\alpha$C2 ($5^{\prime}$-CGGCATGCGTTGTAACCGCCCAGTCGTTC-3′) and OP ($5^{\prime}$-TTTGAGCTCTACACC GTCAAGTGC GAA GAGC-3′). All PCR reactions were performed in a final volume of $50 \mu\mathrm{l}$ and the PCR mix (GenAmp${ }^{\mathrm{R}}$ PCR core reagents, Perkin Elmer) was as recommended by the manufacturer with the following modifications: each dNTP final concentration was $100 \mu \mathrm{M}$, 1.5 units of AmpliTaq ${ }^{\mathrm{R}}$ DNA polymerase and $20 \mathrm{pmol}$ of each primer were used per reaction. PCR consisted of one cycle of denaturation ($95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}, 6 \mathrm{~min}$), followed by 40 cycles of amplification that included denaturation ($95^{\circ}\mathrm{C}, 1 \mathrm{~min}$), annealing ($68^{\circ}\mathrm{C}, 1 \mathrm{~min}$ when primers $\alpha$C1 and OP were used; $65^{\circ}\mathrm{C}, 1 \mathrm{~min}$ when using primers $\alpha$C2 and OP), primer extension ($72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}, 1 \mathrm{~min} 30 \mathrm{~s}$) and a $10 \mathrm{~min}$ final extension at $72^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$.

### DNA extraction and Southern blot analysis

DNA extraction and Southern blot analysis were performed as described previously (Pelicic et al., 1997). The probe specific for the 85C gene used in the Southern blot experiment corresponds to the first 255 bp of the PCR product A (region

between primer $\alpha$C1 and a KpnI restriction site; see Fig. 1). The probe corresponding to the entire Tn5367 transposon was isolated as a HindIII restriction fragment from pYUB285 (McAdam et al., 1995).

#### DNA sequencing and analysis

Approximately $1 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of PCR fragment was purified by using the Geneclean II kit (Bio 101). The sequence of the purified PCR fragment was directly determined by an automated DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems, model 373) with a dye deoxy terminator cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems). The oligonucleotide used to sequence the PCR product A was $\alpha$C1. The BLAST algorithm (Altschul et al., 1990) was used to search protein databases for similarities.

#### Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting

The pellicle growth conditions allowed an easy harvest of cells by permitting the medium to be collected while the pellicles remained attached to the flasks. The culture broths were collected, sterilized by filtration through a $0.2 \mu \mathrm{m}$ sterile Nalgene filter (Nalge), concentrated under vacuum to $1 / 10$ of the original volume and precipitated twice with six volumes of cold ethanol to eliminate most of the salts. The precipitates were collected after centrifugation at $14000 \mathrm{~g}$ for $1 \mathrm{~h}$, dissolved in distilled water, dialysed against distilled water and adjusted to $50 \mu \mathrm{g} \mathrm{ml}^{-1}$ by evaporation under vacuum at room temperature. Protein concentration was determined by the Coomassie blue reaction (Bio-Rad protein assay).

Protein extracts were resuspended in sample buffer containing $9.95 \mathrm{M}$ urea, $4 \%$ Nonidet P-40, $2 \%$ ampholytes, pH 5–7, and $100 \mathrm{mM}$ dithiothreitol. For two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, $15 \mu \mathrm{g}$ of proteins were loaded onto the isoelectric focusing (IEF) gel (pH range 4–8 ampholytes) and focused for $20000 \mathrm{Vh}^{-1}$. The second dimension was performed on $10 \%$ acrylamide slab gels according to our standardized procedure (Laurent-Winter et al., 1997). Detection of the resolved proteins was performed by silver staining according to Morrissey (1981). The relative molecular masses of the observed proteins were determined according to molecular mass markers applied to a slot on the same gel.

For Western blotting experiments, proteins carried on the 2D gels were transferred onto nitrocellulose membranes (Hybond C extra, Amersham) by using a Mini-Transblot apparatus according to the recommendations of the manufacturer (Bio-Rad). Membranes were incubated overnight at room temperature with a rabbit polyclonal antiserum raised against the antigen 85 complex of *M. bovis* BCG (De Bruyn et al., 1987) diluted 1:4000 and with a donkey anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G horseradish peroxidase-linked whole antibody (Amersham) diluted 1:2000 for $1 \mathrm{~h}$ at room temperature. Detection was performed using the ECL detection kit (Amersham).

#### Isolation, fractionation and analysis of lipids

Lipids were extracted from wet cells for 4 days with $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3} / \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}(1: 2, \mathrm{v} / \mathrm{v})$ at room temperature with continuous stirring; the bacterial residue was re-extracted five times with $\mathrm{CHCl}_{3}$/
CH₃OH (2:1, v/v) and the organic phases were pooled and concentrated. The crude lipid extracts were partitioned between the aqueous and the organic phases arising from a mixture of CHCl₃/CH₃OH/H₂O (8:4:2, v/v/v); the lower organic phases were collected, evaporated to dryness to yield the crude lipid extracts from each strain and comparatively examined by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) on silica gel-coated plates (G-60, 0.25 mm thickness, Merck) developed with petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1 or 7:3, v/v), CHCl₃/CH₃OH (9:1, v/v) or CHCl₃/CH₃OH/H₂O (30:8:1 or 65:25:4, v/v/v). In order to separate mycolate-containing lipids from other compounds, cold CH₃OH was added to the diethyl ether solution of crude lipids (10–50 mg ml⁻¹) and the mixture was left at 4°C for 1 h and then centrifuged (4000 g, 15 min). The pellets which consisted primarily of mycolate-containing molecules were recovered, dried under vacuum, dissolved in CHCl₃ and applied to a silica gel 60 column (particle size 0.063–0.200 mm, Merck) equilibrated in CHCl₃. The column was irrigated stepwise with increasing concentrations of CH₃OH in CHCl₃. Fractions were collected in bulk. Glycoconjugates were revealed by spraying plates with 0.2% anthrone in concentrated H₂SO₄, followed by heating at 110°C. The Dittmer-Lester reagent (Dittmer and Lester, 1964) was used for visualizing phosphorus-containing substances. Fractions were monitored by TLC on silica gel-coated plates as described above, and fractions containing the same lipid compounds were pooled and rechromatographed to yield purified substances (as judged from the absence of contaminant by TLC), which were analysed by infrared using a Perkin-Elmer FTIR 1600 spectrophotometer.

The various classes of extractable lipids were quantified by labelling (Daffé *et al.*, 1991). Forty microcuries of L-methyl-[¹⁴C]-methionine (Amersham, France) was added to 100 ml Sauton medium which was then inoculated by Mt103 and MYC1554; 5-week-old cells were harvested, extracted with organic solvents and the lipids were analysed as described above. Radioactivity was located and counted on plates using an automatic TLC linear analyser (Berthold LB 2832). Then, the lipids were visualized by spraying anthrone followed by charring.

Delipidated cells from 5-week-old bacilli, lipid extracts and the various fractions eluted from the silica gel 60 column were dried under vacuum before weighing and were saponified; the fatty acids were methylated and analysed as described previously (Daffé *et al.*, 1983). Quantification of mycolic acids resulted from the saponification of at least 300 mg (dry weight) of delipidated cells from Mt103 and MYC1554 in the same growth phase. Three sequential determinations from separate preparations of delipidated cells were performed. Mycolic methyl esters were analysed by TLC using petroleum ether/diethyl ether (9:1, v/v) for four runs, and dichloromethane as developing solvent (Daffé *et al.*, 1983). Mass spectrometry analysis of mycolates was carried out as described previously (Dubnau *et al.*, 1997).

or MYC1554. The inoculum was dispersed by rotating the plates, which were subsequently incubated at 37°C for 3–4 weeks. The susceptibility of the two strains for rifampicin was tested by the Bactec radiometric technique using a Bactec brand 460TB System instrument; Mt103 and MYC1554 were inoculated at the same concentration in Bactec 12B mycobacteria culture vials (Middlebrook 7H12) containing rifampicin. For all the drugs tested, 99% inhibition of the bacterial growth was determined as the MIC of the drug.

### Permeability assays

Exponentially grown cells from Mt103 and MYC1554 in the same growth phase were first labelled for 16 h with [5,6-³H]-uracil (2 × 10⁻⁵ M, 1.85 TBq mmol⁻¹) to quantify the biomass present in aliquots used in accumulation assays. Then, cells were collected by centrifugation and washed with 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.2). Aliquots of labelled cells were counted, dried and weighed in order to correlate ³H-labelling with cell dry weight.

Accumulation assays were performed under continuous agitation. [¹⁴C]-Glycerol (6.5 × 10⁻⁶ M, 5.66 GBq mmol⁻¹, purchased from Amersham), [¹⁴C]-chenodeoxycholate (2 × 10⁻⁵ M, 1.8 GBq mmol⁻¹, purchased from DuPont NEN) or [¹⁴C]-INH (1.4 × 10⁻⁴ M, 0.48 GBq mmol⁻¹, a generous gift from the NIH) was added to a 1 ml mixture of HEPES containing ≈40 mg of ³H-labelled 3-week-old Mt103 and MYC1554 cells. Aliquots (0.1 ml) were taken up at different time intervals and added on the top of an Eppendorf centrifuge tube containing 0.25 ml of oil (silicon oil/paraffin oil 1:0.2, v/v). Cells were separated from the accumulation medium by centrifugation (13 000 g, 1 min). Centrifuged tubes were frozen on dry ice and the pellets were dropped into counting flasks by cutting the cone tops. Then, the scintillation solution (Aqualuma) was added and the vials were sonicated for 30 min in a water bath to disperse cells. Counting was carried out using a Packard Tricarb 1900 TR equipped with a ³H/¹⁴C program. In parallel experiments, [¹⁴C]-glycerol was added to ³H-labelled cells and the mixture was first incubated with arsenate (50 mM) for 15 min; then, aliquots were taken up at different time intervals and treated as above.

Diffusions of defined compounds through liposomes were compared by the liposome swelling assay. Liposomes were prepared with 57 μmol of phosphatidylcholine and 2.3 μmol of phosphatidylglycerol. Optical density (OD) changes in liposome suspensions were measured with a spectrophotometer Uvikon UV 333; recorded data were converted to comma-separated value files. The liposome swelling assays in isotonic solutions (25 mM) of sucrose, glycerol and INH were followed over a 2 min period. A decrease in the OD corresponds to swelling of liposomes.

### Preparation and infection of mouse bone marrow macrophages

Bone marrow cells were flushed from the femurs of 7- to 8-week-old BALB/c mice and suspended in Dulbecco medium with low-glucose (1 g l⁻¹) and high-carbonate (3.7 g l⁻¹) concentrations (Gibco BRL) and enriched with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (Dominique Dutscher), 10% L-cell

### Drug sensitivity assays

Molten solid Middlebrook 7H11 medium containing ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin or streptomycin in dilution series were added to the wells of six-well plates. These media and Löwenstein-Jensen medium containing INH, ethambutol or pyrazinamide were inoculated with 10⁻⁶ mg of either Mt103

conditioned medium and 2 mM glutamine. For the infection assays, mice bone marrow macrophages were seeded in eight-well Lab-Tek chamber slides (Nalge Nunc International) ($5 \times 10^{4}$ cells per well in a volume of $400 \mu \mathrm{l}$) and allowed to differentiate for 6–8 days. An aliquot of the $M$. tuberculosis suspensions used to infect macrophages was plated onto Middlebrook 7H10 agar to establish the exact number of bacteria in the inoculum. Before macrophage infection, mycobacteria were washed twice in the cell culture medium described above, and sonicated in a sonicator bath (Branson 2200) for $15 \mathrm{~s}$. Bacterial aggregates were allowed to sediment for $10 \mathrm{~min}$. The top $500 \mu \mathrm{l}$ was recovered and bacterial concentrations were adjusted to $2 \times 10^{4}$ bacteria $\mathrm{ml}^{-1}$ with cell culture medium.

The infection assay was as follows: the culture medium of each Lab-Tek chamber slide well was removed and replenished with $500 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of the mycobacterial suspension described above in order to have a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1:1. Control wells containing non-infected macrophages were filled with $500 \mu \mathrm{l}$ fresh culture medium. Infected and non-infected cultures were incubated at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in a $5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ atmosphere for $18 \mathrm{~h}$. Then, infection was terminated by removing the overlaying medium and washing each well three times with $500 \mu \mathrm{l}$ Hank's buffered salt solution (HBSS) (Gibco BRL) before adding $400 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of fresh culture medium per well. At days 1 (18 h), 4, 7 and 11, the number of intracellular cfu was evaluated in four wells containing Mt103-infected macrophages and in four wells containing MYC1554-infected macrophages. For this purpose, macrophage monolayers were washed three times in HBSS buffer and then lysed in $100 \mu \mathrm{l}$ of cell culture lysis reagent (Promega). Different dilutions of this lysis solution were plated onto 7H10 or 7H10-Km plates to perform the count of Mt103 and MYC1554 cfu respectively. At each time point, a Lab-Tek chamber slide containing Mt103- and MYC1554-infected macrophages cultivated in the same conditions was subjected to acid-fast bacilli staining in order to check the macrophages viability. The infection experiment was carried out in duplicate.
