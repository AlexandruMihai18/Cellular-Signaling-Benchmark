**Non-Cell-Autonomous Regulation of Cellular Senescence in Cancer**

Diletta Di Mitri¹ and Andrea Alimonti¹,²,*


Cellular senescence is a permanent growth arrest that is broadly recognized to act as a barrier against tumorigenesis. Senescence is predominant in premalignant tumors, and senescence escape is thought to be required for tumor progression. Importantly, evidences indicate that cell-autonomous mechanisms, such as genetic alterations or therapeutic interventions targeting specific genetic pathways, can affect the senescence response in cancer. Nevertheless, new findings have emerged in the last few years that indicate a fundamental role for the tumor microenvironment in the regulation of cellular senescence. Indeed, cytokines belonging to the senescent secretome, as well as tumor-infiltrating immune subsets, have been described to modulate the senescence response in tumors. Such evidence demonstrates that senescence initiation also relies on non-cell-autonomous mechanisms, which are discussed in the present review.


### Hallmarks of Cellular Senescence

Cellular senescence is a stable state of cell cycle arrest that occurs in proliferating cells as a consequence of various triggers [1]. Similarly to apoptosis, senescence can oppose tumor formation in different contexts and tissues [2–4]. The progressive shortening of telomeres during cellular replication and the accumulation of DNA damage are at the basis of this biological phenomenon that causes a permanent arrest of cell proliferation as a strategy to prevent genomic instability [5,6]. Importantly, in addition to replicative senescence, which occurs following cell proliferation, diploid cells can also experience an accelerated senescence response, termed premature senescence, which can be triggered by sub-cytotoxic stress including oxidative stress and ionizing radiation [7,8]. Anticancer chemotherapy also induces premature senescence in primary and cancer cells, a type of senescence known as therapy-induced senescence (TIS) [9–11]. Furthermore, senescence can be induced by metabolic stress in primary cells or by overexpression of oncogenes and loss of tumor-suppressor genes [12,13] (Box 1).


Instead of a specific biomarker, senescent cells are characterized by the expression of a diversity of indicators that reveal irreversible proliferation arrest, including an increase in cell size and a more flattened shape, the expression of senescence associated β-galactosidase activity (SA-β-gal), and increased levels of p53 (tumor protein 53/TP53) and the cell cycle inhibitors p16INK4A (also known as cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A/CDLM2A), p21CIP1 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A/CDKN1A), and p27 (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B/CDKN1B). The DNA damage response (DDR) can also be considered to be a marker of senescence in some models; however, senescence can occur without detectable DDR signaling [e.g., ectopic expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors p21CIP1 and p16INK4A, loss of the tumor-suppressor PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog)], or


**Trends**

Cellular senescence acts as a barrier against tumorigenesis. Overexpression of oncogenes and loss of tumor-suppressor genes trigger senescence *in vivo* in several tumor models where senescence is thought to play a fundamental role in restraining tumor growth and progression.

The role of senescence in tumor development is controversial. The senescence-associated secretome provokes tumor-suppressive and tumor-promoting responses.

Cellular senescence is regulated by cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms. The senescence response can be triggered by genetic alterations, but recent evidence suggests that the tumor microenvironment modulates the senescence response in cancer.

Immune subsets infiltrating the tumor modulate the senescence response in cancer. Th-1 lymphocytes promote senescence induction in target tumor cells, while MDSCs support senescence escape in cancer.

**Box 1. Oncogene-Induced Senescence and Tumor-Suppressor Loss-Induced Senescence**

Overexpression of several oncogenes has been shown to induce senescence both *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Mutations in oncogenic RAS can be found in a wide variety of human cancers and in 30% of all tumors [59]. However, RAS requires the cooperation of another oncogene or inactivation of tumor-suppressor genes to cause transformation. Indeed, overexpression of oncogenic RAS in primary cells in the absence of additional mutations results in a permanent form of cell cycle arrest termed oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), and RAS mutations have been shown to be a barrier against tumorigenesis *in vivo* in several mouse models [2,4]. Mutations of BRAF can be found in 70% of the cases in human melanoma. Importantly, activated BRAF is thought to favor senescence induction in nevi, where it drives p16 upregulation, thus representing a barrier against progression towards melanoma [57]. Recent findings demonstrated that BRAF-induced senescence relies on the secreted protein IGFBP7 (insulin-like growth factor binding protein 7) and that loss of this protein is a crucial step for the development of melanoma [60]. Furthermore, OIS driven by HRAS G12 V or BRAF overexpression in human fibroblasts is associated with massive hyperproliferation and DNA hyper-replication, which results in the activation of an S phase-specific DDR (Figure I) [61].

In addition to the over expression of oncogenes, tumor-suppressor gene loss can trigger senescence both *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Complete loss of PTEN induces a senescence response termed PTEN loss-induced cellular senescence (PICS), which occurs in the absence of hyperproliferation and DNA damage. Importantly, PICS is triggered by p53 activation and is characterized by upregulation of p16 and activation of the PI3K pathway [11,21]. Similarly to PTEN loss, loss of function or mutations in *NF1*, the gene involved in type I neurofibromatosis, is also associated with senescence induction. Neurofibromatosis is a tumor disorder characterized by the development of benign tumor lesions in the nervous system, and these present hallmarks of senescence induction, such as SA-β-gal and p16 positivity [62,63]. An additional example of senescence induced by tumor-suppressor loss is represented by the inactivation of *VHL* (Von Hippel–Lindau tumor suppressor, E3 ubiquitin protein ligase). In the murine kidney, VHL loss causes the formation of benign renal tumor lesions characterized by a senescence phenotype [64]. Finally, RB1 loss in thyroid cells induces the formation of benign adenomas characterized by increased levels of senescence markers, mediated by E2F (E2F transcription factor 1/E2F1) activation. RB1 loss promotes elevated NRAS activity that in turn induces a DNA damage response and p130 (Rb-like 2/RBL2)-dependent cellular senescence [65] (Figure I).

overexpression of different phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) mutants] [8,14,15]. Importantly, senescent cells are characterized by specific metabolic requirements, and such metabolic changes are now considered to be fundamental in senescence induction [16]. Recent findings demonstrate that senescent cells are characterized by an increase in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and that the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex is a master regulator of this metabolic requirement [16]. Moreover, malic enzymes, which catalyze the oxidation of malic acid into pyruvate, are downregulated in senescent cells, thereby facilitating mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation [17]. Taken together, these studies demonstrate that, in contrast to cancer cells, senescent cells rely on maximal energy production driven by enhanced mitochondrial metabolism.

Until recently the induction of cellular senescence in cancer cells has been mainly ascribed to cell-autonomous mechanisms. Overexpression of oncogenes and loss of tumor-suppressor genes induce senescence in primary cells by upregulating different pathways that promote stable cell growth arrest (Box 1). Functional genetic screening has been also instrumental in identifying genes and pathways that contribute to senescence bypass in a cell-autonomous manner. Nevertheless, new evidence is emerging that supports a major role for cell-non-autonomous regulation of senescence in cancer. Senescent cells secrete a diversity of growth factors, cytokines, and proteases, known as the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) [18,19]. The SASP seems to be a common feature of different types of cellular senescence responses. The SASP in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) is regulated by persistent DDR [20]; however, other types of senescence responses present a SASP in the absence of DDR, suggesting that additional mechanisms can account for the regulation of the SASP [21,22]. Indeed, both C/EBPβ (CCAAT/enhancer binding protein β/CEBPB) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) transcription factors are involved in the regulation of the SASP of senescent cells [22–24], while STAT3 (signal transducer and activator of transcription 3) inhibition leads to the reprogramming of SASP in prostate tumors [22–24]. Furthermore, p38MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase 14/MAPK14) activation is central to SASP expression, even in the absence of a DDR [25].

Importantly, SASP has been also described to modulate the recruitment and activation of the immune response at the tumor bed. In this regard, recent findings have revealed that tumor-infiltrating immune cell subsets can both induce senescence in the tumor by releasing proinflammatory cytokines and clear senescent cancer cells [26,27]. By contrast, tumor-infiltrating myeloid cells have been described to oppose senescence *in vivo* [28].

In this review we focus on recent advances that demonstrate a role of the senescence-associated secretome and the tumor immune response in the cell-non-autonomous regulation of senescence.

## Senescence Modulation by the SASP

In contrast to apoptotic cells, senescent cells secrete a great diversity of growth factors, cytokines, and proteases, known as the SASP. SASP factors have been described to reinforce the senescence program in an autocrine manner, and to promote senescence induction in a paracrine mode (Figure 1). Importantly, SASP factors can also promote the immune surveillance of senescent cells, leading to their elimination from tumors and normal tissues [26,29,30]. Nevertheless, results describing the impact of SASP on cancer initiation and progression are still controversial, and several studies strongly suggest that, at least in some contexts, the SASP may fuel inflammation and exert pro-proliferative activity, thus contributing to tumorigenesis [18] (Figure 2). Therefore, cellular senescence constitutes a barrier against tumor progression but, if senescent cells are not removed quickly, they may become deleterious because the SASP can reinforce tumorigenesis.

Figure 1. **Senescence Induction in Cancer**. Senescence initiation in cancer relies on genetic alterations (OIS, oncogene-induced senescence; tumor-suppressor loss-induced senescence). In addition, therapeutic interventions such as chemotherapy can induce a senescence response in tumors (TIS, therapy-induced senescence). Senescence can spread through autocrine and paracrine mechanisms to neighboring tumor cells, thus restraining cancer cell proliferation. Its combination with immunotherapies may enhance tumor clearance of senescent cells, thus restraining tumorigenesis. Abbreviation: SASP, senescence-associated secretory phenotype.

### Interleukin 8 (IL-8)
IL-8 is a member of the CXC motif chemokine family that is frequently upregulated in the SASP of senescent tumor cells [31]. It has been described to be a fundamental activator of the innate immune response because it mediates cell migration and apoptosis in target cells. IL-8 is a potent agonist of the CXCR1 and CXCR2 receptors, which are mainly expressed by cells of granulocytic and monocytic origin. Several findings indicate elevated expression of CXCR2 in preneoplastic lesions, and tumor-associated mutation and loss of expression is seen in advanced cancers [32,33]. Nevertheless, numerous studies reveal that IL-8 is a potent pro-angiogenic factor, and many antagonists of its receptors have been developed as anticancer treatments [34].

Members of the CXC chemokine family, such as CXCL1 and CXCL2, are known to be key factors of the SASP in senescent murine fibroblasts. Indeed, senescent cells were found to activate a self-amplifying secretory program in which CXCR2 ligands reinforce cellular senescence by influencing the activation of the DNA damage checkpoint [33]. Senescence induction following CXCR2 engagement is mediated by p53 and Rb (retinoblastoma) activation because depletion of CXCR2 by shRNA delayed senescence in IMR-90 cells. Expression of G12 V mutant HRAS (Harvey rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) was also shown to induce the upregulation of CXCR2 in human fibroblasts. Therefore a model was proposed by which HRAS-G12 V cells secrete IL-8 that binds to CXCR2 in an autocrine manner, thereby stimulating senescence. Furthermore, in accordance with the pro-senescence activity of IL-8 in cancer, the expression of CXCR2 in prostate glands was upregulated in benign prostatic intraepithelial neoplastic (PIN) lesions and downregulated in prostatic adenocarcinoma. The expression of CXCR2 and its ligands was also significantly increased in papillomas [33].

### Interleukin 6
Another factor frequently found upregulated in the SASP of senescent cells is IL-6. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine implicated in a variety of cellular functions, including the immune response,

Figure 2. Senescence-Associated Secretory Phenotype (SASP) in Cancer. The SASP can exert both pro-tumorigenic and anti-tumorigenic effects. SASP has been described to promote the reinforcement of senescence in cancer by inducing senescence induction in both an autocrine and a paracrine manner. In addition, multiple factors of in the SASP can activate the immune response against the tumor, thus promoting tumor clearance. By contrast, the SASP has been described to promote cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition, thus inducing tumor progression and invasiveness.

inflammation, and hematopoiesis [35]. Many findings indicate strong interplay between IL-6 and cancer. IL-6 has been described to be a main regulator of the Janus kinase (JAK)/STAT pathway, thus promoting tumor cell proliferation, cancer invasion, and immunosuppression. Indeed, IL-6 is upregulated in almost all tumor types, and high levels of circulating IL-6 predict a poor outcome in cancer patients [36]. Unexpectedly, in specific circumstances IL-6 may act as a potent inducer of cell growth arrest and differentiation. IL-6 was shown to correlate with RAS V12-induced senescence in murine embryonic fibroblasts [37,38]. Further evidence showed that IL-6 is a major component of the senescent cell secretome because it is released from senescent fibroblasts *in vitro* and in senescence-positive pre-neoplastic and neoplastic lesions *in vivo* [39]. IL-6 was also found to be upregulated in senescent human diploid fibroblasts under oncogenic signaling by BRAF (B-Raf protooncogene, serine/threonine kinase) V600E [40]. Suppression of IL-6 or its cognate receptor IL-6R was sufficient to allow these cells to bypass OIS. In addition, cell surface-bound IL-1α is the main inducer of senescence-associated secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 in these settings [41]. IL-6 acts in concert with IL-8 to initiate senescence, thus confirming previous findings indicating strong cooperation between these two cytokines in the promotion of the inflammatory response [40].

Interleukin 1α
IL-1α is a main regulator of the immune response, as it elicits the release of several proinflammatory mediators such as IL-6 and IL-8. Recent findings demonstrate that IL-1α is capable of sustaining senescence and mediating paracrine senescence in normal neighboring cells. Using a co-culture system of senescence and normal IM90 fibroblasts, it was demonstrated that OIS can transmit senescence in a non-cell-autonomous manner [42]. Overexpression of HRAS in primary cells triggered senescence and induced a senescence response in HRAS⁻ cells. Factors secreted by senescent cells were responsible for this paracrine senescence as normal cells exposed to conditioned medium from HRAS⁺ cells accumulated senescence markers. In addition, several previously identified secreted factors present in the conditioned media of HRAS⁺ cells, including transforming growth factor (TGF)β1, mediated senescence induction [42]. Interestingly, IL-1α signaling was found to be the master regulator of the SASP of OIS [41]. Indeed, TGFβ1 induced some components of the SASP but it did not mimic the entire SASP. Conversely, ectopic IL-1α expression activated a SASP-like response that arrested IMR90 cells, causing a senescence response accompanied by increased oxidative stress and DNA damage,

and induction of both p53 and p21CIP1. Genetic and pharmacological inactivation of IL-1R or inflammasome components also prevented OIS. Treatment with an IL-1R inhibitor *in vivo* reduced overall senescence in a mouse liver model of OIS. Taken together, these data demonstrate that secreted factors can transmit senescence to normal cells and that IL-1 signaling controls the SASP in OIS [42].

Tumor-infiltrating Gr1⁺ (myeloid differentiation antigen) myeloid cells can also antagonize senescence driven by PTEN loss by secreting IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) into the tumor microenvironment. IL-1 signaling was found to be essential for triggering senescence in PTEN-null tumors *in vivo* and that IL-1RA released by immune cells can block senescence induction. Conditioned media from IL-1α-depleted senescent cells markedly reduced the pro-tumorigenic effect of the SASP, suggesting that once senescence is executed, for instance in tumors treated with TIS, IL-1RA could be used to counteract the negative and long-lasting effect of the SASP. These findings have a tremendous implication for cancer chemoprevention and therapy because they demonstrate that IL-1α could mediate paracrine senescence at distant sites and that treatments that enhance IL-1RA may be detrimental during chemotherapy [28].

### Senescence Modulation by the Immune Response

Recent studies demonstrate that there is tight interconnection between the tumor immune response and the senescence response in different tumor lesions. Senescent tumor cells can promote both the recruitment and activation of different subsets of the innate and adaptive immune responses. Similarly, components of the adaptive and innate immune systems can promote the clearance of senescent cells or antagonize senescence in tumor cells. Such interaction is largely dependent on the type of tumor-infiltrating immune cell subsets, which can vary according to the genetic background of the tumors and the SASP composition. Importantly, the recruitment and activation of proinflammatory immune populations, such as M1 macrophages, T-helper 1 (Th-1) lymphocytes, and natural killer (NK) cells, drives the clearance of senescent tumor cells, thus restraining tumorigenesis. By contrast, tumor-infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) have been described as negative regulators of senescence induced by tumor-suppressor loss and therapy-induced senescence (Figure 3).

### Type 1 T Helper Cells

T helper CD4⁺ lymphocytes cells orchestrate the immune response by triggering the activity of antigen-specific effector cells and recruiting and activating cells of the innate immune system. Th-1 cells are characterized by the secretion of interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, and are commonly considered to be essential in the response against tumor growth [43]. In a mouse model of liver cancer, senescence driven by NRAS [neuroblastoma RAS viral (v-Ras) oncogene homolog] G12V overexpression promotes a cellular senescence response in the absence of tumorigenesis. Notably, senescent cells induce the activation of Th-1 cells that in turn mediate the clearance of premalignant hepatocytes [26]. It was observed that CD4⁺ T cells are required to orchestrate such clearance. Indeed, overexpression of NRAS G12V in the liver of C.B-17 severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mice lacking T, B, and NK cells promotes the formation of tumors. In this setting, cells expressing NRAS G12V are not removed from the liver and escape senescence induction through an unidentified mechanism, thus promoting tumor formation. Importantly, and in contrast to previous evidence, NRAS-specific Th-1 lymphocytes could be detected in mice in which OIS was triggered by expression of NRAS G12V, thus demonstrating that immunosurveillance of premalignant senescent hepatocytes is orchestrated by antigen-specific CD4⁺ T cells. Nevertheless, adoptive transfer of memory CD4⁺ T cells, obtained from immunocompetent C.B-17 mice with hepatic NRAS G12V expression, was not capable of restoring senescence surveillance in C.B-17 SCID/beige mice (lacking a functional innate immune response), suggesting that CD4⁺ T cells require innate immune cells to kill

**Figure 3. Non-Cell-Autonomous Modulation of Senescence in Cancer.** The tumor immune microenvironment plays a fundamental role in the modulation of the senescence response in cancer. Type 1 T helper (Th-1) lymphocytes provoke senescence induction in target cells through interferon (IFN)γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α release, while M1 polarized macrophages induce a senescence response mediated by transforming growth factor (TGF)β signaling. Conversely, tumor infiltrating myeloid-derived suppressive cells (MDSCs) hinder senescence induction and spread through secretion of interleukin 1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) in the cancer microenvironment, thus interfering with the IL-1α signaling pathway. Finally, tumor-infiltrating immune subsets, such as natural killer (NK) cells, M1 macrophages, and Th-1 cells, contribute to tumor restraint by promoting the clearance of senescent cancer cells.

premalignant senescent cells. In accordance with these results, depletion of macrophages and monocytes dramatically reduced senescence surveillance in this setting [26].

In a recent study, Th-1 cells were shown to induce senescence in a pancreatic tumor model in which the simian virus 40 large T antigen (Tag), expressed under the control of the rat insulin promoter, attenuates both p53 and Rb expression [27]. When combined, IFNγ and TNFα drive Tag-expressing cancer cells into senescence by inducing permanent growth arrest, activation of p16INK4A, and downstream Rb hypophosphorylation. Further study determined that this cytokine-induced senescence strictly requires STAT1 and tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1) signaling in addition to p16INK4A. Indeed Tag-specific Th-1 cells induced a permanent arrest of Tag-expressing cancer cells *in vivo* by inducing an IFNγ and TNFR1-dependent senescence response. Taken together, these data demonstrate that Th-1 cells play an essential role as regulators of cellular senescence in premalignant and malignant tumor lesions (Figure 3).

**Myeloid-Derived Suppressive Cells**

MDSCs are a heterogeneous cell population of immune cells characterized by the coexpression of the Gr-1 and CD11b myeloid differentiation markers in mouse, and either or both of the common myeloid markers CD33 and CD11b in human [44]. Of note, MDSCs are considered to

be fundamental players in the orchestration of immunotolerance in tumors, and have been described to infiltrate most types of human cancers [45]. Importantly, multiple lines of evidence have shown that cancer formation promotes the migration of MDSCs from the bone marrow to the tumor bed through the release of specific cytokines and chemokines that induce myeloid cell trafficking, proliferation, and differentiation [46]. Increased levels of circulating myeloid cells are detected in a variety of cancers, and correlate with both poor prognosis and resistance to treatments such as chemotherapy and hormonal therapy [46]. Intriguingly, it has been recently demonstrated that tumor-infiltrating Gr1⁺ myeloid cells are implicated in senescence evasion *in vivo* in prostate tumors initiated by the conditional depletion of the tumor suppressor PTEN [28]. In this setting, MDSCs antagonize the senescence response driven by PTEN loss through the secretion of IL-1RA in the tumor microenvironment. The IL-1R antagonist can block IL-1R leading to the inactivation of the IL-1α signaling pathway, an essential regulator of OIS. Importantly, chemotherapy-induced senescence is antagonized by IL-1RA released in the tumor, demonstrating that senescence in cancer can be antagonized in a non-cell-autonomous manner by a subset of immune cells (Figure 3). In this regard, it has been shown that blocking MDSC trafficking to the tumor site by means of an antagonist of the CXCR2 receptor is able to hinder tumor progression, restore the senescence response, and revert chemotherapy resistance in prostate cancer. Of note, indirect evidence suggests that tumor-infiltrating MDSCs are also able to promote evasion of OIS in a model of lung cancer induced by KRAS (Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog) G12V overexpression. Finally, clinical evidence demonstrates that patients whose tumors were strongly infiltrated by CD33⁺ and IL1RA⁺ myeloid cells showed a decreased response to docetaxel treatment administered in an adjuvant setting [28]. Therefore, treatments that decrease the recruitment of myeloid cells in tumors could enhance the efficacy of TIS in different cancer patients. However, such an approach could be limited by the fact that these cells can be quickly mobilized from the bone marrow after cessation of specific treatments. Alternative approaches should be utilized to differentiate these cells in more mature cells, using for instance trans-retinoic acid or additional compounds that are currently under investigation.

### Natural Killer Cells

NK cells develop in the bone marrow from common lymphoid progenitor cells and distribute widely throughout lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues. Multiple findings support the notion that NK cells play a fundamental role in the early control of viral infection, and in hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation and reproduction (uterine spiral artery remodeling). Importantly, NK cells can be found in the tumor bed of most types of cancer, where they have been described to mediate immunosurveillance, and the presence of tumor-infiltrating NK cells has been associated with a favorable outcome in patients with colorectal carcinoma, gastric carcinoma, or squamous cell lung cancer [47]. It is now commonly accepted that the activation of NK cells depends on an intricate balance between activating and inhibitory signals, and that NK cell-mediated killing depends on the modulation of self-proteins expressed on the surface of target cells, rather than on recognition of foreign antigens. Indeed, tumor cells that downregulate the expression of type I major histocompatibility complex (MHC-I) are recognized and cleared by tumor-infiltrating NK cells, whereas their MHC-I-expressing counterparts escape NK cell-mediated immunosurveillance [48,49].

Notably, the activation of NK cells plays a crucial role in the clearance of senescent cells in cancer (Figure 3). Restoration of p53 in a model of liver cancer was able to induce a cellular senescence program that was associated with the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines. This program triggered an innate immune response mediated by tumor-infiltrating NK cells that targeted the tumor cells *in vivo*, thereby contributing to tumor clearance [26]. Senescence reactivation did not drive apoptosis, contrary to previous dogma, providing evidence of an innate immune clearance of senescent cells. Moreover, the elimination of senescent tumor cells in a similar tumor model

was dependent on the expression of the activatory receptor NKG2D (killer cell lectin-like receptor K1/KLRK1) on tumor-infiltrating NK cells. p53 restoration in this context caused tumor cells to secrete various chemokines such as CCL2 (chemokine C-C motif ligand 2), which promoted the recruitment of NK cells, thus resulting in NK cell activation and tumor clearance [50]. Interestingly, activation of an NK cell subset by senescent cells has been observed in a clinical context when multiple myeloma cells were treated with low doses of chemotherapy and genotoxic agents. In this setting, a DNA damage-mediated response, initiated by ATM (ataxia telangiectasia mutated) and ATR (ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related) engagement, was capable of inducing the upregulation of NKG2D and DNAM-1 (DNAX accessory molecule-1/CD226) ligands, thus resulting in the restoration of immunosurveillance against the tumor by circulating NK cells [51].

**Macrophages**

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are considered to be a crucial component of the tumor microenvironment because they can promote both tumor clearance and tumor progression, depending on their activation state. M1 polarized macrophages are involved in tumor clearance and are characterized by the release of proinflammatory cytokines and by strong phagocytic activity. By contrast, M2 polarized macrophages exert an immune-tolerant function that mainly relies on the secretion of anti-inflammatory factors, such as IL-10 and arginase, and are known to promote tumorigenesis through their immunosuppressive and pro-angiogenic functions [52].

Recent evidence demonstrates that macrophages can regulate senescence at multiple levels. Macrophages can induce senescence in a Eμ-MYC transgenic mouse lymphoma model [30]. Here, MYC (v-Myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog) overexpression in lymphoma induces apoptosis in some tumor cells and activates macrophages to secrete TGF-β that in turn induces senescence in lymphoma cells. Therefore, macrophages limit tumorigenesis by inducing senescence in the tumor microenvironment in a non-cell-autonomous manner. Intriguingly, TGF-β promoted cellular senescence in tumor cells without inducing DNA damage and in a p53-dependent manner. Adoptive transfer of phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-stimulated Ana-1 cell line macrophages into mice harboring MYC-driven lymphomas drove a strong senescence response. By contrast, depletion of macrophages by liposome-encapsulated clodronate lowered the number of TAMs and decreased senescence [30].

Recently, macrophages have been described as an essential immune cell subset that participates in the clearance of senescent cells in a model of liver fibrosis [53] (Figure 3). In the presence of chronic liver damage, ablation of p53 in hepatic stellate cells increased liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, thus provoking the formation of hepatocellular carcinoma. These phenotypes were associated with the presence of M2 polarized macrophages. Interestingly, the secretome of p53-null HSCs skewed the macrophages towards an M2 phenotype. By contrast, p53-expressing senescent stellate cells released factors that skewed macrophage polarization towards a tumor-inhibiting M1 state capable of removing senescent cells. This resulted in the promotion of an antitumor microenvironment.

**Sterile Inflammation and Senescence**

Inflammation as a result of trauma, ischemia-reperfusion injury, or chemically induced injury typically occurs in the absence of any microorganisms and has therefore been termed ‘sterile inflammation’. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that an inflammatory microenvironment promotes the development of cancer, thus playing a dual role in tumorigenesis. Indeed, mouse pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasias (mPanIN) and ductal adenocarcinomas (mPDAC) develop in acinar cells that harbor the KRAS oncogene upon exposure to non-acute pancreatitis induced by acreulin treatment. The inflammation contributed to tumor growth and progression by

hindering the senescence barrier characteristic of low-grade mPanINs, thus indicating that subsets or factors composing the innate or adaptive immune response, or factors released by damaged cells in the tumor bed, may drive senescence escape in mPDAC cancer in a non-cell-autonomous fashion and promote tumor development in this setting [54]. Furthermore, anti-inflammatory treatments reverted tissue damage and delayed progression of pancreatitis-induced mPanIN Lesions. Finally, in a limited cohort of patients affected by PanIN, it was demonstrated that these tumor lesions display senescence markers only when patients receive anti-inflammatory treatments. In addition, the senescence-associated inflammation positively correlated with the progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma mPDAC in a mouse model of pancreatic cancer. The study demonstrated that the histone deacetylase-associated protein SIN3B (SIN3 transcription regulator family member B) is required for KRAS OIS in this setting. Surprisingly, SIN3B inactivation abrogated the senescence response, impaired inflammation, and delayed mPDAC progression. Furthermore, evaluation of human pancreatic tissue and cancer cells revealed that SIN3B is decreased in control and PDAC samples, compared to samples from patients with pancreatic inflammation [55]. Another study found that dietary or genetic obesity induces alterations of the gut microbiota, thereby increasing the levels of deoxycholic acid (DCA), a bacterial metabolite that causes DNA damage. DCA was able to provoke senescence in hepatic stellate cells, which in turn secreted various inflammatory and tumor-promoting factors in the liver. When mice were treated with a chemical carcinogen, secreted factors released by senescent cells were able to increase tumorigenesis. However, blocking DCA production or reducing gut bacteria through antibiotic treatment efficiently prevented hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development in obese mice. Similar results were also observed in mice depleted of senescent HSCs. Therefore, a mixture of proinflammatory factors triggered by a chemical substance and DCA produced by the gut microbiota can be associated with a protumorigenic SASP [56]. Together, these findings suggest that the cooperation of senescence and inflammation may be deleterious in cancer and lead to tumor progression. Conversely, the cooperation of inflammation and senescence may also be effective in restraining tumorigenesis. Indeed, a model of hepatocellular carcinoma induced by chronic liver damage was found to be associated with fibrosis, inflammation, and strong recruitment of immune cell populations [53].

### Concluding Remarks

It is now clear that cellular senescence is a fundamental barrier against tumorigenesis, and that its induction plays a crucial role in the arrest of tumor growth and progression both in human and murine cancers (see Outstanding Questions). Indeed, senescence-associated markers can be found in several premalignant tumor lesions and in tumors treated with TIS, indicating that senescence induction may be fundamental in restraining tumor growth toward the malignant phase [12, 57]. Nevertheless, malignant human tumors lack the senescence-associated features, suggesting that such responses can be evaded. As discussed, both cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms can account for senescence evasion. In light of such evidence, treatments that can promote senescence induction in tumors or alter senescence evasion may be fundamental in attempting to limit tumor progression, and are currently under consideration in the clinic. Nevertheless, cellular senescence has been paradoxically associated with a tumor-promoting dark side, mainly mediated by the SASP and the tumor immune response [18]. In this regard, treatments that focus on the reprogramming of the cellular secretome should be taken into consideration. A recent study has demonstrated that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway leads to reprogramming of the senescence-associate secretome, thus reverting the immunosuppressive microenvironment induced by the SASP in this context [22]. Interestingly, it has been recently demonstrated that drug resistance observed in tumors treated with BRAF, ALK (anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase), or EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) kinase inhibitors is driven by the induction of a reactive secretome which promotes oncogenic signaling. The combination of

**Outstanding Questions**

- Tumor-infiltrating immune subsets modulate the senescence response in cancer. How does the tumor genetic background affect the recruitment of immune populations to the tumor bed?
- What strategies might be developed to induce the reprogramming of the secretome in cancer cells?
- What is the future direction for pro-senescence treatments in cancer?
- Combinatorial therapies seem to be promising in cancer therapy. What combinations would be effective in promoting senescence induction in cancer?

multiple inhibitors was capable of overcoming treatment resistance, suggesting that reprogramming of the cell secretome may be of fundamental interest in the development of future therapeutic strategies in cancer [58]. Therefore, such approaches could also work to reprogram the SASP of TIS. Additional promising strategies to overcome the dark side of the SASP may be the combination of pro-senescence compounds with different immunotherapies that aim either at promoting tumor immune clearance or at inhibiting the recruitment and activation of specific immune cell subsets infiltrating the tumor.
