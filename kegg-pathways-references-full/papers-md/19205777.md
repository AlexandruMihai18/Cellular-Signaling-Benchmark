### Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia: a not so rare “disease of the desmosome” with multiple clinical presentations

---

#### Abstract
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/dysplasia (ARVC/D) is a rare but increasingly recognized form of a cardiomyopathy, involving primarily the right ventricle. Mutations in seven candidate genes coding for five desmosomal proteins (plakoglobin, plakophilin-2, desmoplakin, desmoglein-2, desmocollin-2), for the cardiac ryanodine receptor-2, for the transforming growth factor beta-3, and for the transmembrane protein 43, respectively, are pathogenetically important. A typical feature of the disease is the replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by fibrofatty infiltrates, leading to electrical instability including ventricular arrhythmias in the early stages, and reduced contractility and heart failure later on. The left ventricle may also be involved. Unfortunately, the disease is often diagnosed post mortem only, especially in young adults dying suddenly during exercise. Since the disease is inherited in up to 50% of cases, the screening of relatives is important. The implantable cardioverter defibrillator is an important therapeutic tool. Nevertheless, the mortality of the disease remains to be 2%-4% per year. Several clinical, electrocardiographic, and imaging parameters were identified as risk predictors for an adverse outcome. In this paper, we describe distinct clinical presentations of ARVC/D, review the genetic background of the disease, and discuss its diagnosis and treatment.

#### Introduction
Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy/ dysplasia (ARVC/D) is an inheritable cardiomyopathy with typically autosomal dominant inheritance. The disease was first described by Fontaine in 1978 [43, 76] and was recognized as a distinct cardiomyopathy eighteen years later [80]. Pathologically, ARVC/D is characterized by progressive fibrofatty replacement predominantly of the right ventricular myocardium (Table 1, Fig. 1). The prevalence of ARVC/D is higher in men than in women (1.6:1) and the incidence is highest between 5 and 40 years. The prevalence is estimated to range from 2/10,000 in the general population to 44/10,000 in some areas in Northern Italy [103] and Germany [95]. It is inherited in 30%-50%. Clinically, patients with ARVC/D present with ventricular arrhythmias or heart failure. ARVC/D is recognized as a cause of sudden, exercise-related deaths in athletes under 35 years of age [31]. ARVC/D also accounts for a significant number of non-exercise-related sudden deaths in the young, i.e. up to 20% both in Europe and the United States [114].

Table 1 Proposed clinical criteria for the diagnosis of ARVC/D [81]

| Criteria | Major | Minor |

| Global and/or regional dysfunction and structural alterations of the RV<sup>a</sup> | Severe dilatation and reduction of RV ejection fraction with no or mild LV impairment<br>Localized RV aneurysms Severe segmental dilatation of RV | Mild global RV dilatation and/or ejection fraction reduction with normal LV function<br>Mild segmental dilatation of RV<br>Regional RV hypokinesia |
| Tissue characterization of walls | Fibrofatty replacement of myocardium on endomyocardial biopsy |  |
| Repolarization abnormalities |  | Inverted T waves in right precordial leads V2 and V3 (patient aged > 12 years, RBBB absent) |
| Depolarization/conduction abnormalities | Epsilon waves or localized prolongation (110 ms) of the QRS complex in precordial leads (V1 or V2 or V3) | Late potentials (signal averaged ECG) |
| Arrhythmias |  | LBBB type VT (sustained or non-sustained) (ECG, Holter, exercise testing)<br>Frequent ventricular extrasystoles with LBBB morphology (≥ 1,000 [> 200]/24 h) (Holter) |
| Family history | Familial disease confirmed at surgery or autopsy | Familial history of premature sudden death (age < 35 years) due to suspected RV dysplasia<br>Familial history (clinical diagnosis based on present criteria) |

For the diagnosis of ARVC/D 2 major, 1 major plus 2 minor, or 4 minor criteria are required, respectively.

To screen relatives for familial ARVC/D the following modification has been suggested: ARVC/D in first-degree relative plus one of the criteria listed above in italics [49]

RV right ventricle, LV left ventricle, VT ventricular tachycardia

ARVC/D seems to be responsible for a certain number of early and unexpected postoperative deaths [117]. If the disease is recognized at an early stage and if appropriate treatment is instituted, sudden cardiac death may be prevented.

### Pathology

Explanted hearts constitute the best source of histologic material with post-mortem examinations accounting for the remainder. Macroscopically, the dilated right ventricle is covered by fat tissue. There is a substantial (≥50%) fibrofatty infiltration starting from the subepicardial areas, with strands of normal or atrophied cardiomyocytes interspersed in-between (Fig. 1), and ultimately reaching the endocardial muscle layers. Degenerative changes of cardiomyocytes, interstitial fibrosis and fat infiltration are all required for the diagnosis of ARVC/D (in normal hearts, some intramyocardial fat can occasionally be seen in the anteroapical region [24], especially in older and overweight subjects). The thickness of the right myocardial free wall may be reduced or increased. The interventricular septum, lacking an epicardium, is often spared by the disease process [123]. Because biopsies are often taken from the interventricular septum to avoid free wall perforation, false negative results can be obtained, despite findings typical for ARVC/D by magnetic resonance imaging

Fig. 1 The myocardium of the right ventricle is partially replaced by fat and fibrous tissue. Strands of myocardium are visible within the fibrous-fatty tissue. These findings are consistent with ARVC/D

[121]. On the other hand, microscopically detected fibrofatty infiltration may not yet be discernible by cardiac imaging [110]. In up to 50%, the left ventricle may also be involved [98], especially in more advanced stages [33]. Three pathogenic mechanisms may explain the progressive replacement of the myocardium by fibrofatty tissue (Fig. 2):

lular apoptosis. Both were present in 75% of myocardial specimens from patients with ARVC/D [73]. Apoptosis may follow the disruption of the intercellular cohesion of cardiomyocytes, and abnormalities of the intercalated discs have been observed by electron microscopy [11].

2. Inflammation: Patchy inflammatory infiltrates are present in up to two thirds of patients with ARVC/D [12]. In other series, much less inflammation was noted, however [116]. The inflammation may occur as a response to the myocardial injury described above. There may be a possible causal link between chronic Bartonella henselae-induced (and possibly enteroviral or adenoviral [22]) myocarditis and ARVC/D, especially in its sporadic non-familial form [39]. Typically, both the right and left ventricle are affected by a myocarditis.

3. Transdifferentiation: Myocardial cells can change into fibrous or fat cells. As shown by immunohistochemistry, vacuolated myocardial cells not only express desmin, but also vimentin, a protein typically made by fibroblasts [36]. The histological findings described form the basis for the electrical reentrant phenomena and late potentials probably generated in the strands of cardiomyocytes within the fibrofatty tissue, which may trigger ventricular arrhythmias. Several animal models exist, including dogs, cats, minks, mice, and fish to study the disease.

### Genetics

In up to 50% of patients with ARVC/D a positive family history can be elicited [34]. Usually, the disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait with incomplete and age-related penetrance and variable forms of clinical expression. Autosomal-dominant forms of ARVC/D have been mapped to 12 different chromosomal loci by linkage analysis or direct sequencing of candidate genes. In addition, an autosomal recessive form of ARVC/D has been reported (Table 2).

The cardiomyocytes are held together at so-called intercalated discs, which are made up by gap junctions, fascia adherens junctions, and desmosomes (the latter two make up the area composita, as they share many proteins [44]). The gap junctions allow the electrical coupling and the transfer of molecules between cells. To secure intercellular mechanical coupling, the fascia adherens junctions connect actin filament bundles and desmosomes connect intermediate filaments (called desmines in cardiomyocytes) from cell to cell, respectively (Fig. 3). Several mutations in genes coding for desmosomal genes have been reported, which cause the phenotype of ARVC/D. Since mutations in desmosomal proteins seem to be important in the pathogenesis of ARVC/D, the disease has been named “a disease of the desmosome” [46, 112].

Fig. 3 Molecular model of the desmosome (modified after [48, 111, 127]). In desmosomes, the cytoskeletal intermediate filaments are linked to cadherins (desmocollin and desmoglein), which are transmembrane proteins and form zipper-like dimers with corresponding cadherins of the adjacent cell. Desmoplakin (DSP) binds to the intermediate filament desmin by its C-terminus and to the armadillo proteins plakoglobin (JUP) and plakophilin (PKP2) by its N-terminus. The armadillo proteins are linked to the cadherins.

Reported gene mutations in ARVC/D

The mutation of Naxos disease, which is inherited in an autosomal-recessive fashion, involves the plakoglobin gene (Table 2). The deletion of nucleotides 2157 and 2158 causes a frameshift and premature termination of translation [82]. The C-terminal domain of plakoglobin is shortened by 56 amino acid residues. The mutant plakoglobin fails to localize at intercellular junctions. Interestingly, expression of connexin-43, a typical gap junction protein, is also significantly reduced in patients with Naxos disease (to <5%), suggesting that the integrity of the desmosome may be a prerequisite for the normal functioning of the gap junction [60]. Perturbed gap junction function as well as loosened mechanical contacts and interspersed fibro-fatty tissue may slow electrical conduction. Phenotypically, Naxos disease is characterized by ARVC/D, palmoplantar keratoderma, and wooly hair. Recently, Kirchhof et al. showed that mice with heterozygous plakoglobin deficiency developed increased RV volume and reduced RV function associated with spontaneous ventricular ectopy. Endurance training had a negative effect on right ventricular function and provoked ventricular arrhythmias in this murine model [64].

Desmosomes also participate in intercellular signaling. In a mouse model, the expression of desmoplakin was blocked by short interfering RNA. This led to increased nuclear localization of plakoglobin and reduced canonical Wnt/β-catenin signaling. Phenotypically, increased expression of adipogenic and fibrinogenic genes provoked accumulation of fat droplets in cardiomyocytes [45]. In heterozygous desmoplakin-deficient mice, an ARVC/D phenotype developed.

Recently, several mutations in a gene encoding for plakophilin-2 protein (PKP2) were described in ARVC/D patients. Mutations in the PKP2 gene are found in up to 43% of ARVC/D patients, and affected family members carry mutations in the PKP2 gene in up to 70% [38, 46, 67, 131]. The described phenotype is typical for ARVC/D with predominant right ventricular involvement. The most recent desmosomal gene mutations discovered in patients with ARVC/D regard the cadherins desmoglein [9, 97] and desmocollin [53, 115], and the armadillo protein plakoglobin [6], respectively.

The most frequent mutations involve the “big 3” genes, i.e. desmoplakin, plakophilin-2, and desmoglein-2 [112].

In addition to the genes coding for the desmosomal proteins, gene mutations involving the transforming growth factor (TGF)-β3 [16], the human ryanodine receptor 2 [15, 124], and the transmembrane protein 43 [84] were found in patients with ARVC/D. TGF-β3 may modulate the expression of desmosomal genes. The familial catechoaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia is also caused by a mutated ryanodine receptor 2, and there is some overlap with ARVC/D 2. The gene coding for the transmembrane protein 43 contains a response element for PPARγ, an adipogenic transcription factor. Dysregulation of this adipogenic pathway may explain the fibrofatty replacement of the myocardium in some ARVC/D patients.

Clinical diagnosis

Unfortunately, the first manifestation of the disease may be a sudden cardiac death (7%–23% [100]). Approximately 75% of these deaths occur during daily activities at home or at work [116]. It may be heralded by palpitations, dizziness or even presyncope or syncope often related to physical exercise. These symptoms are due to ventricular arrhythmias and require further investigation. Very rarely, patients may complain of chest discomfort, which is not provoked by exertion. The patients are usually young (33 ± 14 years, range 13–73 [41]), with a male predominance. In other patients, symptoms and signs of heart failure [47] may be the first presentation. Sometimes it will be difficult to make a differentiation from other cardiomyopathies or myocarditis. Physical examination may be normal in about 50% of patients. A wide splitting of S2 due to delayed pulmonic closure secondary to RV dysfunction may be present [4]. A tricuspid regurgitation murmur is sometimes observed, as well as an S3 gallop due to right ventricular failure.

The still valid but currently re-evaluated major and minor criteria to diagnose ARVC/D are depicted in Table 1. Basically, global and/or regional dysfunction and structural alterations of the right ventricle should be documented by an imaging modality. ECG criteria include the presence of T-wave inversions in right precordial leads V2 and V3 with prolongation of the QRS complex (>110 ms), epsilon waves, and arrhythmias such as ventricular extrasystoles or ventricular tachycardias with LBBB morphology. The propensity for arrhythmias may be quantitated by documentation of late potentials in signal-averaged ECGs. An endomyocardial biopsy to show replacement of the right ventricular myocardium by fibrofatty tissue is selectively performed. A diagnosis of ARVC/D is made if either 2 major, 1 major and 2 minor, or 4 minor criteria are present, respectively. The diagnosis of ARVC/D based on these criteria will miss a substantial number of patients. It is therefore important to regularly follow-up patients who did not meet the Task force criteria initially. Diagnostic symptoms or signs of the disease may develop over time [62]. This concealed phase of the disease (Fig. 2) may not be the least dangerous one. Hulot et al. [57] showed in a retrospective analysis of 130 patients that the natural history of the disease may be diverse. The overall mortality rate was 18.5% during an 8 year follow-up and the annual mortality rate was 2.3%. Mean age at death was 54 ± 19 years. The most important cause of death in this study cohort was progressive heart failure (59%) with sudden death being less frequent (29%). The documentation of ventricular tachycardias and clinical signs of right

ventricular failure and/or left ventricular dysfunction were risk factors for cardiovascular death (Table 3).

Differential diagnosis

A very important differential diagnosis is idiopathic right ventricular outflow tract ventricular tachycardia (RVOT-VT) [85]. The disease is characterized by repetitive ventricular tachycardias of the left bundle branch block (LBBB) morphology with an inferior axis, suggesting an origin in the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). The same morphology can be found in patients with ARVC/D, but the duration of the QRS complex during the tachycardia is usually longer (≥120 ms [3]) than in RVOT-VT. RVOT-VT is not inherited, is more common in women, is not associated with structural heart disease, and has a benign course. RVOT-VT can be initiated by isoproterenol infusion [141]. These ventricular tachycardias respond well to betablockers or verapamil, and radiofrequency ablation is usually curative. The 12 lead ECG as well as the signal averaged ECG are normal. In the early stages of ARVC/D the differentiation from the benign RVOT-VT may not be possible.

Catecholaminergic ventricular tachycardia is characterized by effort-induced polymorphic or bidirectional ventricular tachycardias in patients with structurally normal hearts. The disease is caused by mutations of the ryanodine receptor 2 gene [101]. Patients with ARVC/D 2 have mutations in the same chromosomal locus (1q42-q43), but have the signs of cardiomyopathy of the right ventricle in addition to the effort-induced tachycardias. These patients die suddenly at a young age.

Myocarditis, which can manifest in an acute or chronic form (leading to dilated cardiomyopathy), as well as cardiac sarcoidosis [92] must be differentiated from ARVC/D.

In victims of sudden cardiac death, the main differential diagnosis is ischemic heart disease. The myocardial ischemia may not only be caused by coronary artery disease, but also by anomalous origin of the coronary arteries. Other heart diseases implicated in sudden death are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy [40, 90], the long QT syndrome, and the Brugada syndrome.

### Evaluation of relatives

Relatives of both deceased and living persons with a diagnosis of ARVC/D should be encouraged to undergo a cardiac evaluation. Hamid et al. proposed that the original Task force criteria should be modified, because the original criteria are highly specific but not sensitive enough to evaluate relatives who may have an early form of the disease (Table 1). When these modified criteria are used to screen relatives, 39% of them will have the disease, as opposed to 28% if the original criteria were used [49]. Screening of first-degree relatives of patients with ARVC/D should include a medical history, a physical examination, a standard 12-lead and a 24-h ECG, a signal-averaged ECG, a bicycle stress test, a transthoracic echocardiography, and a cardiac MRI. If high-risk features such as palpitations, syncope, nonsustained or sustained ventricular tachycardias are present, an electrophysiologic study may be performed to reproduce clinical ventricular tachycardias and to guide ablation [141]. Due to the progressive nature of the disease, a follow-up every 3–5 years (earlier, if symptoms develop) is recommended [135]. In the future, molecular genetic analysis may play a role in the screening of families [112]. This approach will allow earlier, pre-symptomatic diagnosis of the disease. However, genetic analysis does not currently contribute to risk stratification in ARVC/D [141].

program for athletes engaging in competitive sports in Italy [31]: The program includes a 12-lead ECG, which allows early diagnosis of cardiomyopathies. A preparticipation screening test, including a questionnaire and a clinical examination of competitive athletes is suggested by the American Heart Association [79]. The questions regarding effort-related (near)syncope, or a family history of premature death, are especially relevant for the potential diagnosis of ARVC/D. It remains controversial whether a 12-lead ECG should be part of a preparticipation screening test [27, 86]. With regard to ARVC/D, serial examinations of the 12-lead ECG are useful, since they may change over time [62]. Distinctly abnormal ECGs, i.e. T-wave inversions in V2-V6, can be found in 1% of trained athletes [93]. In about 40% of these individuals, a heart disease (including ARVC/D in 4%), will be diagnosed either initially or during follow-up. Heidbüchel et al. examined 46 high-level athletes, 80% of them cyclists. All had either symptoms attributable to ventricular arrhythmias or documented nonsustained VTs. In almost 60% of these athletes a diagnosis of ARVC/D was made during the follow-up period of 4.7 years. The authors speculate that endurance sports, which are associated with long-lasting volume overload of the right ventricle, may lead to early structural damage of the right ventricle. The study also suggests that in symptomatic persons a thorough work-up is mandated [52]. Interestingly, Kirchhof et al. showed that mice with heterozygous plakoglobin deficiency developed increased RV volume and reduced RV function associated with spontaneous ventricular ectopy. Endurance training had a negative effect on right ventricular function and provoked ventricular arrhythmias in this murine model [64].

A diagnosis of phenotypically overt ARVC/D precludes engagement in competitive sports [77], because physical exercise may trigger ventricular arrhythmias. Noncompetitive sports activities such as bowling, golf, and brisk walking are permitted [78], if the patient is arrhythmia- and symptom-free under therapy. Silent gene carriers are allowed to participate in sportive activities. Half-yearly to yearly follow-up examinations are recommended [51].

### Screening of athletes

Sudden deaths in young athletes occur with a frequency of 1:200,000 in the United States [79], and ARVC/D accounts for about 4% of these deaths. In Italy, this percentage is fivefold higher [32]. However, an analysis of the past 25 annual incidence rates of sudden cardiovascular deaths in the Veneto region of Italy showed a significant decrease by 89% in athletes aged 12–35 years. This decline is due to the screening

### ARVC/D and perioperative deaths

Tabib et al. reported a retrospective series of 50 patients who died postoperatively after low-risk surgery [117]. In 18 of these patients (36%, mean age 30 ± 16 years) an ARVC/D was diagnosed at autopsy. Four patients died during induction of anesthesia, nine during surgery and five within 2h postoperatively. In another series of 200 patients with ARVC/D
who died unexpectedly and suddenly, death occurred perioperatively in 10%, indicating that these patients may be difficult to resuscitate [116]. The authors speculate that the perioperative stress or drugs may trigger arrhythmias. Preoperative screening should include an ECG [125], and more extensive work-up for patients with a positive family history for sudden cardiac death.

### Electrocardiography

#### Standard 12-lead ECG

The 12 lead ECG is not normal in 85% of patients with ARVC/D [87]. Typically, negative T waves are present in leads V1-V3 (Fig. 4), sometimes extending to V5 or V6, especially in patients with left ventricular involvement. The duration of the QRS complex is often prolonged to ≥110 ms, which may be restricted to the right precordial leads V1-V3. In fact this differential prolongation of the QRS complex, also known as parietal block, defined as QRS duration in (V1 + V2 + V3)/(V4 + V5 + V6) ≥ 1.2, has a sensitivity of 98% and a specificity of 100% to diagnose ARVC/D [94]. In addition, the S-wave upstroke in leads V1 through V3, measured from the nadir of the S wave to the isoelectric baseline is prolonged to ≥55 ms in patients with ARVC/D without right bundle branch block (RBBB) [87]. This finding was the most prevalent ECG sign in patients with ARVC/D and also helped distinguish ARVC/D from benign forms of RVOT-VT. Moreover, in 25% of the ARVC/D

patients an epsilon wave can be found in the right precordial leads, which corresponds to the asynchronous depolarization of the right ventricle (Fig. 4). In up to 25% of patients with ARVC/D, the ST-segment in right precordial leads (V1-V3) is elevated [94]; the differential diagnosis includes Brugada syndrome [5].

Interestingly, dispersions of the QRS complex (≥40 ms) or the QT interval (>65 ms) are greater in sudden death victims of ARVC/D compared to healthy controls and patients with milder forms of the disease [130]. A prolonged PR-duration and the presence of a bundle branch block were shown to be additional parameters to predict an adverse outcome [68]. In advanced stages of the disease, the surface ECG may show low voltage QRS complexes due to massive dilatation of the right heart chambers encircling the left, since the latter usually make the most significant contribution to QRS forces [25].

#### 24-h Holter ECG and implantable loop recorders

The 24-h Holter ECG may reveal multiple ventricular premature beats or ventricular tachycardias with LBBB morphology. These findings are important minor criteria for the diagnosis of ARVC/D. Ventricular ectopic beats with a RBBB morphology suggest left ventricular involvement. Up to 25% of patients have supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, possibly due to atrial progression of the disease [126]. If no relevant ventricular arrhythmias are found in patients with palpitations or syncope using 24-h Holter ECGs, and if not an electrophysiologic study

A small epsilon- wave is seen in lead V1 (notch or slurring of small amplitude in the ST transition zone consistent with an after depolarization, vertical arrow).

was planned anyway, a loop recorder [109] may be implanted to monitor the heart rate and rhythm for a prolonged time period.

### Exercise testing

Ventricular arrhythmias may be triggered by exercise; therefore exercise testing is important in patients with suspected ARVC/D. The ventricular tachycardias with LBBB morphology should be differentiated from the more benign RVOT-VTs, which are found in patients without underlying cardiomyopathy. The RVOT-VTs typically show an inferior axis orientation in the extremity leads (positive QRS vector in II, III, avF and negative QRS vector in aVL). In patients with ARVC/D this same axis is observed if the VT originates in the pulmonary infundibulum (Fig. 5b). There is a left or superior axis deviation (Fig. 5a) if the VT arises from the inferior wall or near the apex in patients with

**Fig. 5** ECG’s showing two sustained ventricular tachycardias with left bundle branch morphology of the same patient. The frontal QRS axis was superior (a, –75°, f = 170 per min) and inferior (b, +75°, f = 160 per min), respectively. Patients with ARVC/D frequently have ventricular tachycardias of different morphologies

extensive ARVC/D [89]. For a reliable differentiation of RVOT-VTs from arrhythmias in patients with ARVC/D an electrophysiologic study may occasionally be necessary [91].

### Signal averaged ECG

The signal averaged ECG detects delayed afterdepolarizations (“late potentials”, corresponding to the epsilon-wave). They mirror the presence of slowed electrical propagation in the myocardium, resulting in delayed ventricular activation. The presence of slowed ventricular activation provides a substrate for reentrant arrhythmias [88]. Late potentials on signal-averaged ECG recordings are a minor criterion for the diagnosis of ARVC/D (Table 1). Consistent with other ECG abnormalities in ARVC/D, the abnormalities on signal-averaged ECG are more prominent in the right precordial leads than they are in the left precordial leads. More extensive forms of the disease usually have more late potentials. Between 50% and 80% of patients with ARVC/D and sustained VTs have an abnormal signal-averaged ECG. Nava et al. examined 138 patients with ARVC/D and found that the signal-averaged ECG was abnormal in 57% of patients and 4% in healthy controls, and calculated a sensitivity of 57%, a specificity of 95%, and a positive predictive value of 92% [89]. The signal-averaged ECG may be normal if the disease is localized to a small segment of the RV, but such patients are not immune to malignant arrhythmias. Abnormal signal-averaged ECG recordings are more common in patients with more severe myocardial fibrosis and reduced RV ejection fraction [129] and predict sustained VTs among ARVC/D patients with prior nonsustained VTs. A filtered QRS duration of >110 ms had the highest utility in identifying ARVC/D patients prone to

inducible monomorphic VTs on programmed electrical stimulation. Signal-averaged ECGs should not be used in patients with QRS duration ≥120 ms in the standard 12-lead ECG, as occurs in 20%-30% of patients with ARVC/D. The best sensitivity is obtained using a 25 Hz high-pass filter [63].

### Echocardiography

The right ventricle is more difficult to examine than the left. This is explained in part by its retrosternal location, and in part by its more complex geometry. Nevertheless, it must be examined in a systematic way [54], including the right ventricular inflow tract (RVIT), the right ventricular body (RVB), and the RVOT. The use of intravenous contrast may be of help. A protocol can be accessed at http://anpat.unipd.it/ARVC. The goal of the examination is to measure the right ventricular dimensions, to quantify the function of the right ventricle, and to visualize the typical hallmarks of the disease (Fig. 6). The left ventricle may be affected by the disease as well.

In an echocardiographic study of 15 patients with ARVC/D, cavity dimensions of RVOT, RVIT, and RVB were significantly larger compared with healthy controls [71]. Dilatation of the RVOT was the most common and consistent finding in a more recent study of 29 patients with established ARVC/D (Fig. 7). A RVOT diameter of >3.0 cm measured in the parasternal long axis view had a sensitivity of 89% and a specificity of 86% for the diagnosis of ARVC/D [139]. In ARVC/D patients, the right ventricular wall may be locally thickened or thinned (normal RV wall thickness: 2.4 ± 0.5 mm). Right ventricular wall motion abnormalities especially of the inferior wall are among the most frequent echocardiographic findings in ARVC/D patients, being present in over 70% [71].

**Fig. 6 Schematic drawing of a 45° right anterior oblique projection obtained during right ventricular (RV) cineventriculography. The diagnosis of ARVC/D is based on the presence of segmental morphologic abnormalities and wall motion abnormalities. The localized lesions are often present in the triangle of dysplasia, consisting of the pulmonary infundibulum, the anterior right ventricular wall including the apex, and the inferior wall including the subtricuspid area. The reduced contractility of the often dilated right ventricle with slow evacuation of contrast material is not shown. The hyperreflective moderator band is an echocardiographic finding.

quantitated [7]. The advantages are that CMR is non-invasive and does not require ionizing radiation. Therefore, the technique is suitable for the frequently young patients and the often required repeat examinations. CMR may not be used in ICD carriers, however. Due to the high negative predictive value CMR is a valid screening tool for ARVC/D in relatives of patients with the disease [118], even though a normal CMR study does not rule out ARVC/D. Protocols for an MRI examination of the heart in persons with suspected ARVC/D have been published [59, 119]. Quantitative analysis showed that RV enddiastolic diameter and outflow tract area were significantly higher, and RV ejection fraction lower in ARVC/D patients compared to controls [119]. In a retrospective analysis of 36 patients Keller et al. reported a sensitivity of 89%, a specificity of 82%, a positive predictive value of 84%, and a negative predictive value of 88% to diagnose ARVC/D by CMR examination. By univariate analysis, infiltration of the right ventricle with fat was predictive for the diagnosis [61]. However, the presence of fatty infiltration of the right ventricular myocardium may be difficult to detect [120]. Even in normal individuals epicardial fat may be present and tongues of epicardial fat may extend into the RV myocardium [18]. The inter-reader agreement to diagnose fat on CMR images is rather poor. CMR is clearly not the gold standard test to diagnose the disease [20]. The results of a CMR examination must be put into the clinical context and should be compared with the findings of other imaging modalities.

Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT)

In patients having multiple extrasystoles despite antiarrhythmic medication or being unable to hold their breath, the acquisition of high-quality CMR images is difficult. MDCT offers the advantage of a shorter scan time and is less operator dependent than CMR. In recent years, the technique of the CT scanners has improved, and machines with up to 64 detector rows are currently in use, with substantially better image quality. As with CMR, intramyocardial fat can be demonstrated, and the calculation of three-dimensional images is possible, although the images are acquired in only one plane [118]. Lead artifacts are a problem in MDCT: 7% of patients with ICD will have interpretable images [19].

Contrast ventriculography and endomyocardial biopsy

Right ventricular ventriculography used to be the imaging gold standard for the diagnosis of ARVC/D.

T. Herren et al.
ARVC/D

Fontaine et al. [41] suggested to obtain two orthogonal views of the RV (45° RAO, 45° LAO) and the use of digitized technique with 25 images/s to ensure optimal analysis and use of an angled 150° pigtail catheter. It should be noted that a normal RV angiogram does not rule out ARVC/D. Hebert et al. examined 85 patients with ARVC/D and reported that 68% had normal right ventricular function [50]. A recent quantitative examination showed abnormal motion of the RV wall at the tricuspid valve and inferiorly, and a significantly reduced RV ejection fraction in ARVC/D patients [58].

The sensitivity of endomyocardial biopsies was reported to be 67% with a specificity of 92% [41]. Therefore, a negative biopsy does not rule out ARVC/D. To lessen sampling errors, biopsy guidance by electroanatomic voltage mapping was recommended recently [8]. Biopsy of the diseased free wall of the RV carries some risk of perforation. If biopsies are taken from the RV side of the interventricular septum, major complications such as cardiac tamponade or complete AV-block occur in less than 1% [56]. RV biopsies may be of value to rule out other diseases, e.g. myocarditis or cardiac sarcoidosis.

### Electrophysiologic testing with programmed electrical stimulation

An intracardiac electrophysiologic study with programmed ventricular stimulation should be reserved for high-risk patients (Fig. 8, Table 3). Its goals are: (1) to quantify the potential to develop malignant arrhythmias, such as sustained VTs and ventricular fibrillation, (2) to measure the hemodynamic consequences of the former, (3) to evaluate the success of drug treatment on inducibility of arrhythmias and (4) to establish the susceptibility of VTs to be interrupted by antitachycardia stimulation before ICD implantation, (5) to establish the basis for a radiofrequency ablation of a potential arrhythmic focus, and (6) to differentiate automatic or triggered foci from reentrant circuits as the mechanism of the arrhythmia [42]. In patients with ARVC/D, the arrhythmias are usually inducible with critically timed extrastimuli, indicating a reentrant mechanism of the ventricular tachycardia. Moreover, the ventricular tachycardias often show more than one morphology (Fig. 5), and fragmented potentials are more likely to be present in ARVC/D patients. These features allow the differentiation from the benign RVOT-VT [91]. In addition, three-dimensional electroanatomic voltage mapping during electrophysiologic testing may increase accuracy of diagnosing ARVC/D [29]. According to current guidelines, electrophysiologic testing might be useful for risk assessment of sudden cardiac death in patients with ARVC/D (class IIb recommendation) [136, 141].

#### Therapy (Fig. 8)

##### Medical therapy

In the acute setting, treatment of a ventricular tachycardia should follow standard procedures [1]. Various drugs have been investigated to suppress the sometimes life-threatening arrhythmias of ARVC/D including betablockers, sotalol, and amiodarone [133]. The most efficacious drug seems to be sotalol with an overall efficiency rate of 68% and 83% to treat

both inducible and noninducible ventricular tachycardia in ARVC/D. However, due to the progressive nature of the disease, arrhythmias may recur despite initial success of drug therapy. Blomstrom-Lundqvist et al. reported on a follow-up of 15 patients treated medically for 9 years. The mortality was 20% [17]. These sobering numbers plus the observation that non-inducibility of VTs during electrophysiologic study does not completely rule out the occurrence of sudden death, suggested that ICD therapy in ARVC/D patients may be a preferred treatment option (see below). Nevertheless, amiodarone or sotalol are indicated when ICD implantation is not feasible (class IIa recommendation [141]). In patients suffering from symptoms and signs of heart failure, drug therapy including ACE-inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers, diuretics, and betablockers is adequate. Patients with a dilated right ventricle and severely compromised function will need anticoagulant therapy as well [137]. It is not known whether medical therapy reduces mortality in patients with ARVC/D [141].

### Radiofrequency catheter ablation (RFA)

In a study of 21 patients reported by Marchlinski et al., no recurrence of ventricular tachycardia was observed during a follow-up period of 27 months after the procedure [74]. This finding was recently confirmed by Satomi et al. using the electroanatomical mapping system CARTO [108]. During a follow-up period of 26 months, 13 of 17 patients did not have ventricular tachycardias after the catheter ablation procedure. Randomized trials comparing ICD therapy with catheter ablation do not exist, however. Radiofrequency ablation therapy cannot be recommended as an alternative to ICD implantation at the current time. Radiofrequency ablation should be tried in patients with frequent ventricular tachycardias or ICD shocks

despite optimal antiarrhythmic therapy (class IIa recommendation [141]). Late relapses after RFA therapy occur because of the progressive nature of the disease [66, 132]. The cumulative VT recurrence-free survival was 25% after 14 months in a recent study [37].

#### ICD

The experience with ICD therapy in patients with ARVC/D has been reported in nine series (Table 4). The implantation of an ICD device can effectively terminate life-threatening arrhythmias in patients with ARVC/D and should be considered standard therapy. Antitachycardia therapies are particularly effective in painless termination of VTs in patients with ARVC/D. However, several caveats need to be stated: Due to the progression of the disease, undersensing ultimately occurred in 13% of patients in the series by Wichter et al. requiring surgical revision or implantation of additional leads [134]. The risk of perforation of the thinned right ventricular wall may increase over time. Other lead problems included insulation failure, fracture, dislodgment, thrombosis, or infection. It is not surprising, therefore, that late complications occur frequently in ICD carriers (Table 4). In addition, inadequate ICD therapies are not uncommon. To diminish the frequency of both appropriate and inappropriate ICD shocks, there is a need for concomitant antiarrhythmic therapy including betablockers.

Accepted indications for ICD therapy are prevention of sudden cardiac death in ARVC/D patients (1) with documented sustained VT or ventricular fibrillation (class I recommendation) and (2) with high-risk features such as extensive disease, positive family history, or undiagnosed syncope (class IIa recommendation [141] (Fig. 8 and Table 3). Moreover, the results of the electrophysiologic study may suggest an

ICD implantation. Piccini et al. reported that 39% of their 11 patients, who received their ICD for primary prevention, received an appropriate therapy during follow-up. In that same study, there was no difference in the incidence of life-threatening arrhythmias in the primary vs. secondary prevention groups. One third of the patients with only probable ARVC/D (i.e. not completely meeting the Task Force criteria) as an indication for ICD placement received appropriate shocks. On the other hand, patients with probable ARVC/D who had normal results in the electrophysiologic study probably constitute a low risk group and do not require ICD intervention [96]. In the future, genetic testing may have a role in identifying patients at risk for sudden death. According to Hodgkinson et al., patients with a high-risk DNA haplotype (ARVC/D 5, 3p25), and/or obligate carrier status by pedigree analysis, had a 28% reduction in mortality compared to a matched historical control group if an

ICD was implanted for primary prophylaxis [55]. Physicians are encouraged to register their patients in the European or the North American Registries (http://www.arvd.com or http://www.arvd.org [75] or http://anpat.unipd.it/ARVC [13]).

### Surgical therapeutic options

Heart transplantation should be considered in patients with refractory congestive heart failure or otherwise intractable ventricular arrhythmias [138]. For patients with predominant right ventricular heart failure, right ventricular cardiomyoplasty may be an option, in which the RV free wall is wrapped with a latissimus dorsi flap [26]. In patients with refractory ventricular tachycardias, RV disarticulation [140] or beating heart cryoablation through sternotomy [10] have been proposed.
