### Transduction of mechanical and cytoskeletal cues by YAP and TAZ

#### Georg Halder, Sirio Dupont and Stefano Piccolo

**Abstract |** The physical and mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment regulate cell shape and can strongly influence cell fate. How mechanical cues are sensed and transduced to regulate gene expression has long remained elusive. Recently, cues from the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion sites, cell shape and the actomyosin cytoskeleton were found to converge on the regulation of the downstream effectors of the Hippo pathway YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) in vertebrates and Yorkie in flies. This convergence may explain how mechanical signals can direct normal and pathological cell behaviour.

In the past 20 years, the study of signal transduction pathways has been a focus of intense research. The main growth factor pathways are now well characterized, and signalling networks of protein–protein interactions and gene expression programmes that control cell behaviour are starting to be delineated. However, cell behaviour is not only governed by chemical signals. Tissue architecture and mechanical forces are also overarching signals that inform cell decisions. Key elements of such architectural signals are cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) and cell–cell adhesions, the organization of the cytoskeleton and tensile forces that keep individual cells and whole tissues in a certain shape. These elements control cell proliferation, cell migration, stem cell identity, differentiation and cell death. Thus, such geometrical and mechanical signals add an additional dimension to cell signalling that may convey information about global tissue properties, such as tissue size, into the behaviour of individual cells¹⁻⁷.

The activity of YAP (Yes-associated protein), TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif; also known as WWTR1) and their fly homologue Yorkie has recently been linked to the nuclear transduction of mechanical and cytoskeletal signals⁸⁻¹². YAP, TAZ and Yorkie are transcriptional cofactors that shuttle between the cytoplasm and the nucleus where they associate with several promoter-specific transcription factors. TEA domain family member (TEAD) transcription factors emerged as the main partners of YAP and TAZ on DNA, although RUNX2, T-box 5 (TBX5) and p73 have also been reported to interact with YAP and TAZ to regulate gene expression¹³⁻¹⁵. YAP, TAZ and Yorkie have key roles in cell proliferation, survival, differentiation, tissue regeneration and organ size determination. Beside these physiological roles, growing evidence links the activity of YAP and TAZ to tumorigenesis, induction of cancer stem cells and chemoresistance¹³⁻¹⁶. Genetic data in mammals indicate that YAP and TAZ perform largely overlapping functions; yet, these closely related proteins may also display specificities in their activity or interacting partners¹⁷.

intense research. The best characterized regulators of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie are the components of the Hippo pathway (BOX 1). The Hippo pathway entails the inhibitory activity of mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1) and MST2 (also known as STK4 and STK3, respectively; which are the mammalian homologues of Hippo in *Drosophila melanogaster*) as well as Large tumour suppressor homologue 1 (LATS1) and LATS2 (which are the mammalian homologues of *D. melanogaster* Warts). LATS1 and LATS2 phosphorylate YAP and TAZ (or Yorkie in flies), thereby promoting their cytoplasmic relocalization or degradation¹³⁻¹⁵.

This Opinion article focuses on the links between YAP and TAZ (or Yorkie) activity and mechanical signals. Following a brief overview of some of the seminal findings that contributed to the early development of the field of mechanobiology (the field that studies the effect of physical forces such as stretching, compression and shear stress on living systems), we examine how the actomyosin cytoskeleton may be involved in the translation of such mechanical cues into biochemical signals. Next, we compare the mechanisms that are involved in the regulation of YAP and TAZ (or Yorkie) activity by the Hippo pathway and cytoskeletal dynamics. We propose that crosstalk between these parallel inputs integrates signalling, architectural and structural cues at the tissue level. Finally, we discuss examples of how such integration may advance our understanding of physiology and disease.

**Mechanical signals control cell fate**

Mechanical signals are highly pervasive in biology. Every cell responds to the mechanical properties of its environment, such as the elasticity (or stiffness) of the ECM and traction or compression forces exerted by neighbouring cells¹⁻⁷. Thus, forces are constantly transmitted across cell–ECM and cell–cell adhesion sites. The cell balances these external forces by adjusting the stiffness of its cytoskeleton¹⁸⁻²⁰. Reciprocally, forces generated inside the cell by the contraction of the actomyosin cytoskeleton are transmitted across adhesion sites to surrounding structures. Thus, the cytoskeleton

Because of their potent biological relevance in various contexts, the identification of the upstream inputs that regulate YAP, TAZ and Yorkie is the focus of

“Tissue architecture and mechanical forces are overarching signals that inform cell decisions.”

PERSPECTIVES

Box 1 | The Hippo pathway in organ growth control

The core components of the Hippo pathway are mammalian STE20-like protein kinase 1 (MST1) and MST2 (known as Hippo in *Drosophila melanogaster*), their cofactor Salvador (SAV; also known as WW45) and Large tumour suppressor homologue 1 (LATS1) and LATS2 (known as Warts in *D. melanogaster*) (see the figure). The Hippo pathway becomes activated when MST kinases (or Hippo) phosphorylate (P) LATS proteins (or Warts), which then phosphorylate YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) (or Yorkie in *D. melanogaster*) on multiple sites. Phosphorylated YAP and TAZ are excluded from the nucleus and accumulate in the cytoplasm, where they are degraded by the proteasome. When the Hippo pathway is inactivated, YAP and TAZ are dephosphorylated, accumulate in the nucleus and regulate gene transcription together with DNA-binding transcription factors such as TEADs (TEA domain family members).

In *D. melanogaster*, mutations in most of the Hippo pathway components result in overgrown adult structures. Similarly, mice with conditionally ablated MST1 and MST2 function exhibit overgrowth of organs, including the liver and the heart, and hyperproliferation of the intestinal epithelium as a result of YAP hyperactivation.

The core components of the Hippo pathway are regulated by several inputs, including cell–cell adhesions and apicobasal polarity complexes. Neurofibromin 2 (NF2; also known as Merlin) binds to multiple upstream components of the pathway (including MST1, MST2 and SAV) to promote phosphorylation of LATS1 and LATS2 (see the figure). NF2 deficiency leads to increased YAP activity in the eye lens epithelium and in the liver, which overgrows. Yorkie-dependent overgrowth phenotypes are also observed in *D. melanogaster* mutants of the Discs-large basolateral polarity complex (comprising the proteins Scribble, Discs-large and Lethal giant larvae; not shown in the figure). In mammals, scribble associates with TAZ, LATS1 and MST2 and promotes LATS protein activation, TAZ phosphorylation, TAZ association with the ubiquitin ligase β-TRCP1 and its degradation (not shown in the figure). Proteins of the crumbs apical-polarity complex (comprising crumbs, PALS1 (protein associated with Lin-7 1) and PATJ (PALS1-associated tight junction protein)) interact with YAP and TAZ and regulate the Hippo pathway in both mammals and flies. Finally, RASSF (RAS association domain-containing family) interacts with MST1 and MST2 and negatively regulates the Hippo pathway.

that well-spread cells proliferate, whereas cells confined to small adhesive areas do not proliferate and instead undergo apoptosis. To prove that this effect was due to changes in cell shape per se, rather than due to the extent of cell–ECM contact areas, cells were seeded on top of arrays of ECM microdots, so that cells could spread from dot to dot over non-adhesive surfaces, thus developing limited contact with the ECM. Notably, cells that spread across these dots still displayed high levels of proliferation, indicating that cell shape and not the extent of cell–ECM contacts is a determining factor for the control of cell proliferation. Similarly, cell shape has been reported to strongly influence cell fate. For example, cell shape affects the balance between keratinocyte self-renewal and differentiation and the differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). Indeed, human MSCs differentiate into osteoblasts when allowed to spread, whereas they differentiate into adipocytes when they are confined to a round shape. Thus, these studies show that cell shape per se is a key determinant of cellular behaviour.

Control by ECM elasticity. Each organ of the human body has a distinct rigidity pattern, which is dictated by ECM elasticity and by the three-dimensional shape of the tissue. In addition to highlighting the crucial role of cell shape, studies of MSC differentiation provided a striking example of how cells respond to the stiffness of their surroundings (FIG. 1b). It was shown that in vitro MSCs display a ‘chameleon-like’ behaviour when confronted with ECM substrates of different elasticity. For example, MSCs differentiate into osteoblasts when seeded on a synthetic matrix engineered to have a bone-like stiffness, into myoblasts when grown on ECMs with intermediate stiffness or into neurons and adipocytes when cultured on a soft ECM. Similarly, skeletal muscle stem cells require an ECM substrate that mimics the stiffness of the adult muscle in order to preserve high regenerative capacity when engrafted back into mice. Moreover, ECM elasticity exerts effects that are comparable to cell shape in controlling cell proliferation. Thus, the varying elastic properties of the different tissues seem to influence tissue regeneration. Taken together, the evidence indicates that, similar to soluble growth factors, cell morphology and the mechanical properties of the cellular microenvironment can affect both cell growth and cell differentiation.

rapidly senses and adapts to changes in the mechanical properties of the microenvironment. It is thought that this dynamic ‘I pull you, you pull me’ interplay results in a state of isometric tension within the cytoskeleton that stabilizes the cell shape and enables cells to sense external forces and to respond by regulating their behaviour.

The spatiotemporal context in which mechanical cues function to control cell fate in vivo and the molecular components that sense and transduce such signals are still poorly understood. However, in recent years, the field of mechanobiology has witnessed a surge of interest, mainly because of two reasons: first, the increasing appreciation that cell shape, ECM elasticity and cytoskeletal tension have pivotal roles in development, physiology and in the aetiology of many diseases (BOX 2); second, the development of new technologies that allow mechanical cues to be investigated as independent experimental variables.

Control by cell shape. The first indication that cell shape is an important regulator of cell behaviour dates back 30 years ago, when it was shown that gradual changes in substrate adhesiveness regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. This was followed by the observation that the degree of cell-shape distortion is itself a fundamental and dose-dependent signal for proliferation control. In these studies, microprinted ECM islands of different sizes were engineered to control the extent of cell spreading of a single endothelial cell (FIG. 1a). Strikingly, it was observed

Mechanical forces in multicellular contexts. The role of mechanical cues ultimately needs to be understood in the context of the multicellular organization that characterizes natural tissues. The mammary gland was one of the first model systems in which this was addressed ${ }^{33,34}$. Mammary epithelial cells (MECs) embedded in a soft matrix, such as a recombinant basement membrane or soft collagen gels, grow into spheric epithelial monolayers (called acini) with a central lumen. In these cultures, MECs undergo growth arrest, polarization and, eventually, differentiation ${ }^{35,36}$. Intriguingly, changes in the elasticity of the ECM have profound effects on the development of acinar structures. A stiff ECM causes disruption of the spheric architecture as a result of reduced cell–cell junctions, defective cell polarization, impaired lumen formation, increased MEC proliferation and even cell invasiveness into the surrounding matrix ${ }^{37,38}$ (FIG. 1c). These results show that the physical properties of the ECM are essential for the structural integrity and proliferative homeostasis of epithelial tissues.

In vertebrates, cells are mechanically coupled in multicellular aggregates (for example, epithelial sheets) through different cell–cell junctions, including adherens junctions and desmosomes. These intercellular junctions contribute to the overall three-dimensional shape of the multicellular structure and enable the transmission of forces between cells. Thus, intercellular junctions contribute to the generation of tension gradients and compression forces within epithelia that may translate into patterning events. For example, when sheets of endothelial cells are grown on substrates that form different geometrical shapes (for example, squares and annular rings), cells that are located at the centre stop proliferating when reaching a high cell density, whereas more stretched cells at the outer border of the colony and at the tips of edges (that is, at points of higher mechanical stress) continue to proliferate ${ }^{39}$. Similarly, the differentiation of MSC aggregates can be guided by manipulating the distribution of tensile and compressional forces ${ }^{40}$.

**Box 2 | A brief overview of mechanobiology**

**Role in early development**

Following fertilization, the first event that limits totipotency of mammalian blastomeres is the morphological process of compaction, whereby cells increase contact with their neighbouring cells and start to stretch. This influences the mitotic spindle positioning in outer cells (which are then committed to the extra-embryonic trophectoderm lineage) and in inner cells (which remain pluripotent). Loss of cell–extracellular matrix (ECM) contact, of cell–cell adhesion or of the mechanosensitive filamentous actin (F-actin) adaptor protein termed talin lead to very early developmental arrest ${ }^{119-122}$. In vertebrates, the three germ layers display different surface tension properties, and this prevents random cell–cell mixing ${ }^{123}$. Gastrulation is a subsequent developmental step that leads to the generation of the body plan and is characterized by an ordered succession of mechanically driven morphogenetic events ${ }^{124,125,133}$. Understanding how these long-range mechanical events concatenate and crosstalk with soluble morphogens remains the holy grail in developmental biology ${ }^{126}$.

**Role in epithelial–mesenchymal interactions**

Organogenesis is often the product of reciprocal interactions between epithelial sheets and their underlying mesenchyme. Mammo et al. recently provided the proof of principle that this crosstalk entails a fundamental mechanical control. In tooth development, the epithelium secretes a combination of soluble attractant and repulsive factors, leading to tight packing of mesenchymal cells. The subsequent change in cell shape (which is cell rounding) drives initial tooth-specific differentiation ${ }^{127}$.

**Role in the cardiovascular system**

Heart morphology and physiology are profoundly influenced by mechanical forces. In zebrafish embryos, interference with shear forces causes heart disorders ${ }^{128,129}$, and shear stress associated with the first heart beat has a causal role in the generation of the first haematopoietic progenitors ${ }^{130,131}$. In the vasculature, disturbance of the laminar blood flow can have profound effects on the homeostasis of endothelial cells, as turbulent flow can predispose to atherosclerosis. Excessive haemodynamic stress on the heart ventricular wall causes a vicious cycle of aberrant ECM remodelling, loss of mechanical compliance and myocyte apoptosis, ultimately leading to heart failure ${ }^{6}$.

**Role in the musculoskeletal system**

In the bone, physical load keeps interstitial fluid flowing through the canicular network, an essential mechanical signal for osteocyte survival ${ }^{1}$. In muscle, alterations in force generation and transmission due to mutations in the ECM or cytoskeletal proteins typically characterizes muscle dystrophies ${ }^{1}$.

By contrast, the role of cell–cell adhesion in mechanosensing has not been investigated in as much detail ${ }^{41,42}$. Here, we briefly introduce the main components of cell–ECM adhesion and how they respond to mechanical cues.

At the molecular level, cell–ECM adhesion is mediated by integrins, which are the main substrate adhesion receptors ${ }^{19,21}$. Integrins, clustered into multiprotein complexes called focal adhesions, provide a direct physical link between the ECM and cytoskeletal adaptors, thereby connecting the ECM with the actin cytoskeleton. The relationship between filamentous actin (F-actin) and the ECM is reciprocal: integrins promote bundling of actin filaments to generate tension within a cell; and, at the same time, the activity of actin regulatory molecules, the rate of actin polymerization and actin spatial organization affect integrin function and thereby the adhesive state of a cell ${ }^{19,21,43}$.

Although cell shape is sustained by the organization of the entire cytoskeleton, major emphasis in the mechanotransduction field has been placed on the dynamics

of actin microfilaments ${ }^{19,21}$, as the contractile forces exerted by F-actin cables and their associated myosin motors are responsible for generating mechanical tension in cells ${ }^{19,21}$. The structure and dynamics of the actomyosin cytoskeleton are regulated by the RHO family of GTPases ${ }^{1-3}$. Inhibition of RHO, myosin, the myosin activity regulating kinases ROCK (RHO-associated kinase) and MLCK (myosin light chain kinase; also known as MYLK) or F-actin polymerization itself, all convert cells into a state of low tensile forces ${ }^{1-3}$. A similar effect is caused by a soft environment or by reducing the area over which a cell can spread ${ }^{21}$. There is indeed a close relationship between the degree of cell spreading and tensile forces, as the actomyosin cytoskeleton exerts higher traction in spread cells than in rounded cells attached to a smaller ECM area ${ }^{19,21}$. However, it is not known whether the ultimate signal that regulates cellular behaviour in response to mechanical cues is the contractility machinery per se or whether contractility is just a means to attain a specific cell shape and cytoskeletal organization ${ }^{44-46}$.

**Mechanical forces and the cytoskeleton**

How do cells sense and transduce mechanical cues? The major structures that are involved in mechanosensing are the sites of cell–ECM and cell–cell adhesion. The molecular machineries by which cells attach to the ECM and sense mechanical cues have been studied in depth and are summarized in several excellent reviews ${ }^{18,19}$.

In endothelial cells, cell geometry is sufficient to change the response to growth factors from apoptosis to proliferation.

By recapitulating these different ECM elasticities *in vitro*, it was found that MSCs differentiate optimally into neurons, adipocytes, skeletal muscle cells or osteoblasts at elasticities that match the physiological ECM stiffness of their corresponding natural niche (shown as coloured lines, with peaks indicating maximal differentiation).

Figure 2 | YAP and TAZ as sensors and mediators of mechanical inputs from the ECM. **a** | The transcriptional regulators YAP (Yes-associated protein) and TAZ (transcriptional co-activator with PDZ-binding motif) are localized in the nucleus and active under experimental mechanical conditions that favour the development of high intracellular resisting forces, such as an unlimited adhesive area and the subsequent adoption of a spread cell shape, a stiff extracellular matrix (ECM) or stretching between stiff micropillars (left). An immunofluorescence image of an endothelial cell plated on a large, square microprinted fibronectin island (middle panel) is shown. Cells were stained for filamentous actin (F-actin) with phalloidin (green) and for YAP and TAZ (red). In these conditions, YAP and TAZ are required for cells to proliferate (in the endothelium and epithelial cells) or differentiate towards osteoblasts (in mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs)). **b** | In mechanical conditions in which cells develop low contractile forces (for example, when they are grown on small adhesive areas favouring a small cell size, on soft ECM or on top of bendable micropillars), YAP and TAZ are inactivated and relocalize to the cytoplasm.

Reduced YAP and TAZ activity shifts the cell responses towards apoptosis and growth arrest or diverts differentiation towards cell fates that would be specified on a soft matrix, for example, adipocytes.

activity. Importantly, Yorkie was found to be required for the F-actin-induced overgrowth of imaginal discs<sup>10,11</sup>.

Thus, the regulation of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie by F-actin is an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon that is relevant for the control of organ growth *in vivo*.

Control of YAP and TAZ by actomyosin

Although the above discussed studies provide compelling evidence for the relevance of YAP, TAZ and possibly Yorkie as downstream mediators of mechanical cues, these discoveries raise several new questions of how mechanical forces and the F-actin cytoskeleton can regulate these transcriptional effectors.

Integrins are central transducers of mechanical cues from the ECM. As such, integrin signalling clearly occurs upstream of YAP and TAZ activity in physiological settings. However, artificial induction of a spread cell shape in a manner that does not engage integrins, for example, by using poly-Lys-coated substrates, can sustain YAP nuclear localization<sup>12</sup>. Moreover, interfering with key components of focal adhesions, such as focal adhesion kinase (FAK; also known as PTK2) or SRC, does not affect YAP and TAZ responses<sup>12</sup>. Thus, it seems more likely that cell spreading per se and the related changes in F-actin structures downstream of integrin signalling are the most crucial mediators that keep YAP and TAZ active.

Are YAP, TAZ and Yorkie regulated by the levels of G-actin versus F-actin? A well-known example of regulation of a transcriptional cofactor by F-actin is the case of megakaryocytic acute leukaemia protein (MAL; also known as MKL1), which is a transcriptional partner of serum response factor (SRF)<sup>47</sup>. Monomeric G-actin binds to MAL and causes its nuclear exclusion and functional inhibition. After serum stimulation and RHO activation, increased actin polymerization reduces the amount of free G-actin; this condition unleashes MAL, leading to its nuclear uptake and activation of SRF-dependent transcription<sup>48</sup>.

However, despite some analogies, current evidence suggests that YAP, TAZ and Yorkie are regulated by a different mechanism. First, cells plated on small ECM islands display increased SRF activity<sup>49</sup> but lower YAP and TAZ activity<sup>8,9</sup>. Second, expression of non-polymerizable G-actin is sufficient to inhibit MAL activity but has no effect on the activity of YAP, TAZ or Yorkie activity *in vitro* or *in vivo*<sup>8</sup> (and G. Halder, unpublished observations). Third, a global increase in F-actin levels, as found in fly mutants for the actin severing protein Cofilin (also known as Twinstar), does not increase Yorkie activity<sup>11</sup>. Altogether these data indicate that YAP, TAZ and Yorkie are not simply regulated by the levels of G-actin. Rather, it is possible that the activity of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie depends on a particular F-actin structure, such as stress fibres or a yet-to-be defined contractile actin network, which is enriched in cells with a spread shape (see below).

Figure 3 | A model for the mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ. When cells are allowed to spread freely on the extracellular matrix (ECM), or when cells are grown on a stiff ECM, extracellular forces promote cell–ECM adhesions via integrins and the development of intracellular contractile filamentous actin (F-actin) structures containing myosin molecules. This is regulated by bidirectional signalling between RHO, ROCK (RHO-associated kinase), integrins and myosin activity. Contractile F-actin structures in turn sustain YAP and TAZ nuclear localization and activity through unidentified molecular effectors. In addition, F-actin also opposes YAP and TAZ phosphorylation through inhibition of the kinases LATS1 (Large tumour suppressor homologue 1) and LATS2. G-actin, globular actin.

Notably, F-actin destabilization or RHO inhibition also activate LATS<sup>9,12</sup>, thus contributing to complete nuclear exclusion of YAP and TAZ (FIG. 3). Indeed, preventing YAP phosphorylation by depletion of LATS partially limits the relocalization of YAP to the cytoplasm following mild inhibition of F-actin<sup>9,12</sup>. This suggests that the opposite regulation of YAP and TAZ by the Hippo kinases and the cytoskeleton can rebalance each other (FIG. 3) but only up to a given extent. In fact, the integrity of the actomyosin cytoskeleton is vital for YAP and TAZ activity. As such, an effective F-actin disruption that causes quantitative cytoplasmic retention of YAP or overt TAZ degradation cannot be compensated by LATS knockdown<sup>8</sup>. The same applies to other attempts aiming to revive YAP and TAZ from the Hippo inhibitory signalling branch (S. Dupont, unpublished observation). Indeed, a more complete latrunculin A treatment still leads to YAP nuclear exit and cytoplasmic relocalization, even in LATS-depleted cells (S. Dupont, unpublished observation).

Further evidence supports a model in which mechanical cues initiate both LATS-dependent and LATS-independent signalling. In mammalian cells, a soft substrate enhances the effects of high cell density (which is thought to induce LATS activity<sup>50</sup>) to inhibit YAP and TAZ target gene expression<sup>8</sup>. Moreover, cells placed in suspension (that is, in absence of any cell–ECM contact) deactivate YAP and promote cell death via anoikis, but LATS knockdown only partially rescues cells from this cell death<sup>12</sup>. In *D. melanogaster*, knockdown of capping proteins enhances the overgrowth phenotypes of mutations in Hippo or Warts on cell proliferation<sup>11</sup>, again suggesting the existence of a Warts-independent Yorkie inhibitor, whose activity is suppressed following F-actin polymerization. Altogether, these data indicate that mechanical forces regulate the activity of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie through both LATS (or Warts)-dependent and -independent pathways.

Dual regulation of YAP and TAZ and Yorkie activity by F-actin and Hippo. Current data point to a multilayered and perhaps complex interaction between F-actin polymerization and activation of the Hippo pathway that regulates YAP and TAZ activity (FIG. 3). Most intriguingly, one set of data suggests that mechanical signals regulate YAP and TAZ through an unknown pathway that acts in parallel to the classic kinase cascade of the Hippo pathway. Knockdown of LATS1 and LATS2 was not sufficient to restore YAP and TAZ activity in the presence of the actin polymerization inhibitor latrunculin A or in cells cultured in soft ECM hydrogels<sup>8</sup>. Consistently, the activity of a TAZ mutant that is LATS-insensitive was still inhibited under the same conditions<sup>8</sup>. We thus envision that, in spread cells, F-actin opposes unknown YAP and TAZ inhibitory molecules, in a manner largely independent of LATS1 and LATS2. For example, we can speculate that a specific F-actin structure might either physically sequester this inhibitory factor, or serve as a platform to promote its post-translational modification, in any case preventing it from interacting with YAP and TAZ. Conversely, when cells are seeded on soft substrates or are confined to small areas, this inhibitory factor may be released (or activated) by the remodelling of the actin cytoskeleton. A related possibility is that protein stretching associated with actin contractility<sup>19</sup> may expose, or mask, cryptic protein–protein binding sites in regulators of YAP and TAZ, controlling their competence to interact with other partners of YAP or TAZ or with YAP or TAZ proteins directly. Alternatively, F-actin reorganization and the resulting formation of a spread cell shape may promote activation of a positive cofactor that mediates YAP and TAZ nuclear localization and activity.

It is important to note that mechanical regulation of YAP and TAZ can occur in isolated cells, indicating that this regulatory network can operate cell autonomously and independently of cell–cell contacts. However, in multicellular epithelia the actin cytoskeleton is connected to adherens junctions and tight junctions, and transmission of mechanical forces through these sites is inherent to junctional maturation and function<sup>42,51,132</sup>. Cell–cell junctions are now considered as important sites to regulate the Hippo pathway<sup>13,15,52,53</sup>. Indeed, multiple

positive and negative regulators of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie are associated with adherens junctions or tight junctions, such as crumbs, scribble, PALS1 (protein associated with Lin-7 1), PATJ (PALS1-associated tight junction protein; also known as INADL and MPP5)), NF2 (neurofibromin 2; also known as merlin), kibra, zonula occludens 2 (ZO2), ajuba, zyxin, angiomotin and α-catenin¹⁵. Some of these molecules bind YAP and TAZ or are associated with LATS kinases⁵²,⁵⁴. However, many of these molecules also display actin-binding or actin-regulatory functions and may thus regulate, or be regulated by, the cytoskeleton. Moreover, contractile F-actin structures can form in response to cadherin engagement⁵¹. These data raise the possibility that YAP and TAZ regulation by the cytoskeletal pathway also occurs downstream of cell–cell contacts.

**Perspectives**

The identification of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie as sensors and effectors of mechanical cues may shed light on several biological processes, such as contact inhibition, skin homeostasis, organ size control and cancer, in which the activity of YAP and TAZ or Yorkie is involved.

**Cell geometry in contact inhibition of cell proliferation.** Cultured cells stop dividing when they reach high cell density, even in the presence of unlimited amounts of growth factors and nutrients. This behaviour is referred to as contact inhibition of cell proliferation and is associated with inactivation and phosphorylation of YAP and TAZ, indicating the involvement of the kinases of the Hippo pathway⁵⁰,⁵⁵. However, the regulation of YAP and TAZ by contact inhibition may be complex and may involve other pathways besides the known Hippo cascade. Genetic data in mouse embryonic fibroblasts show that the mammalian Hippo kinase homologues MST1 and MST2 are not required for contact inhibition⁵⁶. Furthermore, LATS1 and LATS2 seem to be largely dispensable for YAP inactivation in contact-inhibited keratinocytes³⁷,⁵⁸.

Clues about additional regulators of YAP and TAZ may come from the observation that cells reduce their contact area with the substrate as cell density increases. Indeed, contact inhibition entails progressive reduction of the cell area as a consequence of cell crowding, and it was shown that a cell arrests its growth only when its size falls below a crucial threshold⁵⁹. Interestingly, increasing the stiffness of the ECM lowers the sensitivity of a cell to contact inhibition⁶⁰,

and reduced RHO activity and cytoskeletal rearrangements are remarkably similar between contact inhibited cells and isolated cells seeded on a small ECM island and not allowed to spread²⁷. Thus, contact inhibition may be a consequence of reduced cell shape and reduced mechanical forces due to the reduced cell–ECM contact rather than a direct effect of cell–cell contacts.

> mechanical forces regulate the activity of YAP, TAZ

**Homeostasis in the skin.** Mechanical signals have profound effects on skin homeostasis. Decreased expression of integrin⁶¹, reduced cell spreading²⁶ or culture in suspension⁶² cause reduced proliferation and increased keratinocyte differentiation. Consistently, disturbance of mechanical homeostasis has a role in skin tumorigenesis: first, ROCK is activated downstream of oncogenic transformation and contributes to the development of squamous cell carcinomas⁶³; second, increased ROCK activity facilitates skin tumour development in mouse models⁶⁴.

Notably, the process of epidermal stratification itself can be interpreted as a differentiation process induced by loss of cell–ECM contacts⁶⁵. Interestingly, in proliferating cells of the basal layer YAP is localized in the nuclei, whereas it is excluded to the cytoplasm in differentiating suprabasal cells. Increased levels of nuclear YAP enhance proliferation and cause defective differentiation. By contrast, inactivation of YAP leads to impaired growth and precocious differentiation⁵⁸,⁶⁶,⁶⁷. Thus, the pattern of YAP activation in the skin can be correlated with the pattern of cell–ECM interactions.

Skin homeostasis also depends on cell–cell contacts. For example, deletion of α-catenin in the skin leads to increased YAP activation. Yet, such activation remains spatially restricted to the basal layer⁵⁷,⁵⁸, indicating that other signals are essential to locally sustain YAP activation, even when cell–cell adhesions are impaired. Such signals may be cell–ECM contacts and the corresponding cytoskeletal dynamics.

**Organ size control.** How organ size is regulated has been a long-standing question in developmental biology. How do organs achieve uniform proliferation rates despite the presence of localized sources of growth factors? And how do organs ‘sense’ when they should stop growing? The regulation of YAP, TAZ and Yorkie by mechanical cues may provide an interesting solution to these riddles. For example, in *D. melanogaster*, many of the adult structures develop from imaginal discs, which grow by cell proliferation to reach their ultimate size. The process of disc growth depends on Yorkie expression¹³,¹⁵. Interestingly, imaginal discs can compensate for experimentally ablated cells⁶⁸, indicating that cells in this tissue can somehow sense the size of the entire imaginal disc and adjust their proliferation rate accordingly. Gradients of morphogen signalling molecules, such as those of Decapentaplegic (DPP) and Wingless, are essential for the growth of imaginal discs; however, these morphogen gradients insufficiently explain how imaginal discs stop growing when they reach their proper size⁶⁹. Computational models that integrate mechanical control with secreted morphogens explain imaginal disc growth better than models based on morphogen gradients alone⁷⁰⁻⁷². The morphogens DPP and Wingless drive cell proliferation mainly in the centre of the imaginal disc where their concentration is highest. As cells in the centre are stimulated to proliferate, the expansion of the centre stretches cells that are located more towards the periphery of the imaginal disc⁷¹. We speculate that such stretching would compensate for low local morphogen concentration, leading to Yorkie activation and sustained Yorkie-dependent cell proliferation. On the other hand, compression of the centre region would favour Yorkie inactivation. Growth is inhibited when the stretching and compression forces are at equilibrium. We propose that in flies carrying mutations in the F-actin inhibitors capping proteins and CAP, this equilibrium is unbalanced, thereby sensitizing cells to Yorkie activation by mechanical forces. The validation of this hypothesis will be an important aim for the field.

**Breast cancer as a ‘mechanodisease’.** Cancer is a disease characterized by loss of spatial control over cell proliferation. Although this has been classically viewed as a consequence of transformation, new evidence suggests that tissue remodelling is intrinsic to cancer progression and even precedes overt disease⁴,⁵. Thus, disturbed architectural features of tissues, a hallmark of cancer, may have a causal and perhaps initiating role in tumorigenesis. Aggressive breast lumps are detected because of their stiffness, which is due to extensive deposition of collagen and the recruitment of stromal cells and inflammation⁴,⁷³. Several inputs (for example, genetic and environmental factors) then converge to upregulate the expression of lysyloxydases, which increase

collagen crosslinking (an ECM modification that has also been associated with tumour progression and invasion)⁷⁴. By contrast, ‘softening’ the tumour microenvironment slows tumour growth and progression³⁸.

Notably, disturbed tumour rheology correlates well with the effects of TAZ during breast cancer progression. TAZ is stabilized and thus constitutively active in more advanced tumours and is essential and sufficient to endow cancer cells with self-renewal capacity, chemoresistance and tumour-initiating capabilities¹⁶. Thus, we speculate that the mechanism by which ECM stiffness is linked to tumour progression may be intimately coupled to TAZ, and probably YAP, activity. In addition, matrix stiffness regulates cell polarity³⁷,⁷⁵, which is a key factor regulating TAZ stability in breast cancer. TAZ forms a complex with the cell-polarity determinant scribble, and loss of scribble disrupts the inhibitory association of TAZ with the core kinases of the Hippo pathway MST2 and LATS1 (REF. 16). In turn, sustaining YAP and TAZ levels can induce epithelial–mesenchymal transition in epithelial cells⁷⁶,⁷⁷, generating a feed-forward loop in which tissue stiffness, loss of polarity and TAZ itself conspire to sustain TAZ levels and advance tumour progression. Although intriguing, the connection between increased ECM stiffness, TAZ and cancer progression awaits experimental validation.

### Conclusions

Mechanical cues may provide a largely unexplored form of positional information, whereby individual cells constantly sense the development of the whole organ or body. YAP, TAZ and Yorkie represent a cellular hub where several pathways and signals converge, including canonical Hippo signalling, cell polarity, EMT and crowd control. Their mechanical regulation could thus set the tone for the responsiveness of a cell to these signals. In turn, YAP and TAZ crosstalk with other signal transduction pathways, including the WNT, transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) pathways⁷⁸⁻⁸². As such, spatial and temporal regulation of YAP and TAZ by mechanical cues may be regarded as a mechanism that controls the magnitude and duration of growth factor signalling. This may ensure that certain structural and architectural checkpoints are met before further developmental or homeostatic events can occur.

It will be interesting to investigate the relevance of YAP and TAZ in various cell-biological assays that are routinely performed only in specific, and perhaps extreme, mechanical conditions. Indeed, most of our knowledge of cell behaviour stems from growing cells on YAP- and TAZ-activating stiff tissue culture substrates (such as plastic or glass) or, at the other extreme, on YAP- and TAZ-inactivating soft and non-adhesive substrates. For example, culturing cells in soft agar, a classic assay to monitor oncogene-mediated transformation, may entail the bypassing of anchorage-dependent activation of YAP and TAZ for survival and proliferation. Furthermore, the manipulation of mechanical parameters to control YAP and TAZ activity may be crucial for exploiting the full regenerative potential of current stem cell-based therapies.

Despite substantial progress, we still lack answers to fundamental questions in the field of mechanotransduction. Future work is needed to understand the distribution of forces in living tissues and embryos and to develop genetic and experimental approaches to manipulate tissue mechanics. YAP and TAZ may represent a starting point to address these issues: on the one hand, mapping their activity *in vivo* may serve as a direct read-out to visualize the effect of architectural constraints; on the other hand, the identification of the mechanisms linking YAP and TAZ regulation to the cytoskeleton would not only fill a major gap in cell biology but also provide tools to tackle the biological relevance of mechanical forces *in vivo*.
