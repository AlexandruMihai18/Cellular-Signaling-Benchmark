# The Role of Innate Immunity in Alcoholic Liver Disease

**Laura E. Nagy, Ph.D.**

The innate immune system represents the first-line response to invading microbes, tissue damage, or aberrant cell growth. Many of the proteins and cells involved in innate immunity are produced by, and reside in, the liver. This abundance in immune cells and proteins reflects the liver’s adaptation to various immune challenges but also makes the organ particularly vulnerable to alcohol’s effects. Heavy alcohol consumption may produce leakage of microbes and microbial products from the gastrointestinal tract, which quickly reach the liver via the portal vein. Exposure to these immune challenges and to alcohol and its breakdown products dysregulates the liver’s normally fine-tuned immune signaling pathways, leading to activation of various cellular sensors of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns. The ensuing expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], interleukin [IL]-8, and IL-1β) results in cellular dysfunction that contributes to alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Investigations into the roles of the various components of liver innate immunity in ALD have begun to uncover the molecular basis of this disease. Further progress in this area may help inform the development of interventions targeting the innate system to augment current treatments of ALD. These treatments could include antibodies against pro-inflammatory cytokines, use of anti-inflammatory cytokines, or suppression of alcohol-induced epigenetic regulators of innate immunity.

Heavy consumption of alcohol poses a well-known health risk worldwide. Alcohol’s effects on health and well-being are numerous and include injuries and fatalities resulting from alcohol-induced incapacitation. Moreover, chronic and heavy alcohol consumption affects the integrity and function of vital tissues and organs, causing slow but significant structural and functional damage over time. One of alcohol’s principal actions is damage to the liver, the primary organ for its metabolism. As a result, some 90 percent of heavy drinkers (i.e., those drinking 60 g or more of alcohol per day)—and even some who drink less—develop fatty liver (i.e., steatosis) (O’Shea et al. 2009). Up to one-third of heavy drinkers may incur more extensive liver injury, including alcoholic hepatitis, scarring (i.e., fibrosis), cirrhosis, or liver cancer (Gao et al. 2011). Moreover, about 70 percent of individuals who develop alcoholic hepatitis will progress to cirrhosis (Schwartz and Reinus 2012). The spectrum of alcohol-induced liver injuries ranging from steatosis to cirrhosis, defined here as alcoholic liver disease (ALD), is therefore a major cause of liver impairment worldwide (Gao et al. 2011).

A major contributor to ALD is alcohol-induced activation of liver innate immunity, precipitating disorders ranging from localized and transient inflammation to widespread hepato-cellular injury and tissue damage (Cohen and Nagy 2011; Gao et al. 2011; Orman et al. 2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012; Wang et al. 2012). Given the pivotal role of the innate immune system in protecting the liver against foreign agents, it may seem surprising that some of the worst outcomes of alcohol-induced liver disease are the result of activation of innate immune cells. But, in fact, recent studies have revealed that alcohol induces immune activation, which drives the progression of ALD.

Innate immunity comprises chemical-physical barriers (e.g., epidermal cells, mucous membranes, and pH), as well as cellular defenses against any invading microbe or agent the immune system perceives as dangerous to the body’s cells and tissues (Gao et al. 2011). These cellular defenses, which

include both immune cells (e.g., macrophages and dendritic cells) and proteins (e.g., cytokines), normally are well balanced to sense and respond to harmful agents while avoiding unnecessary immune activation. Alcohol disrupts this balance, triggering immune responses that result in inflammation (Gao et al. 2011; Seki and Schnabl 2012; Szabo et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012). Continued high alcohol intake fuels a multistage process in which alcohol-induced liver damage advances along a continuum of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis, to the final stage, cirrhosis, marked by widespread tissue deformation and damage (Gao et al. 2011; Orman et al. 2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012; Wang et al. 2012).

It has been known for some time that alcohol consumption triggers inflammation of the liver, but how alcohol brings about this disease state has long remained unclear. More recently, researchers have uncovered key roles of Toll-like receptors (TLRs), whose activation during alcohol exposure results in upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα] and interleukin [IL]-1β) and chemokines (e.g., monocyte chemoattractant protein [MCP]-1). Moreover, these immune responses result in production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), epigenetic changes, and infiltration of tissues with circulating monocytes and neutrophils (Gao et al. 2011; Petrasek et al. 2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012; Szabo et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2012).

Although the exact molecular mechanisms through which alcohol activates innate immune cells are not entirely understood, there is increasing evidence for the close relationship between the effects of alcohol on the gastrointestinal (GI) tract and injury to the liver. Heavy alcohol consumption changes the composition of microbial communities in the GI system, tipping the balance toward more pathogenic species. Recent observations in animal models suggest that these changes are involved in promoting ALD (Yan and Schnabl 2012). Alcohol also seems to

disrupt the structural integrity of the gut, causing release of bacteria and bacterial products into the circulation, which activates innate immune responses (Rao 2009; Seki and Schnabl 2012; Yan and Schnabl 2012). Because the GI tract is closely connected to the liver via the portal vein, the liver is a focal point for these alcohol-induced, gut-derived immune challenges.

Receptors located on resident immune cells in the liver (i.e., Kupffer cells; see sidebar, “Liver Cell Types and Their Roles in ALD”) sense and transmit these immune challenges. These receptors are specifically adapted to the high-challenge environment of the liver, and this adaptation contributes to the decreased responsiveness to immune challenges (i.e., liver tolerance) in healthy individuals (Petrasek et al. 2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012). However, alcohol’s effects on the gut and on immune cells, such as Kupffer cells, reduce liver tolerance and thus increase the potential for persistent inflammation. For example, microbial metabolites and cellular products released in response to the damage caused by alcohol and its metabolites activate cell surface (e.g., TLR4) and intracellular (e.g., nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain [NOD]-like) receptors (Cohen et al. 2011; Petrasek et al. 2013). This activation triggers the expression of pro-inflammatory genes, secretion of cytokines, and recruitment of various immune cells.

Additional findings suggest that alcohol exposure leads to heritable changes in how genes are expressed (e.g., epigenetic regulation) (Curtis et al. 2013). These long-lasting changes in gene expression may shift production of immune cells from anti- to pro-inflammatory cells and may induce other cellular changes that promote inflammation and ALD. Alcohol consumption also destabilizes reduction and oxidation processes (i.e., the redox balance) in the liver (Cohen et al. 2011), leading to increased production of destructive ROS that damage tissues and thus activate innate immune cells in the organ.

The goal of this review is to highlight recent advances in efforts to unravel the role of innate immunity in ALD. The following sections will focus on knowledge gleaned from recent studies of the roles of innate immune cells, proteins, and pathways in the development and progression of ALD. Although ALD is a human disease, much of the current knowledge of the role of innate immunity in ALD has been inferred from animal and in vitro cellular models of alcohol exposure. The significant degree of conservation in innate immune pathways from mouse to human bolsters the idea that many, if not most, findings in these animal and cellular models can be extrapolated to people. However, most of the information from the animal and cellular models discussed in this review awaits confirmation in studies with human subjects. The article will also explore how this knowledge may be used for treating and managing this disease.

## The Natural History of ALD

Approximately 30 percent of people who regularly consume large amounts of alcohol have a significantly increased risk for developing ALD (Lucey et al. 2009; O’Shea et al. 2010), which becomes chronic and progressively worse if alcohol consumption continues unchecked (Gao et al. 2011). The disease typically commences with the development of fatty liver (i.e., hepatic steatosis); with continued heavy alcohol consumption, steatosis may transition to inflammation, resulting in tissue damage and fibrosis (see figure 1). Ultimately, chronic ALD results in extensive organ damage and disease characterized by necrosis (i.e., cirrhosis), and in about 2 percent of cases, cancer (i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma) may develop (Orman et al. 2013; Schwartz and Reinus 2012). Alcoholic hepatitis—an acute manifestation of ALD that may coincide with clinical signs of fatty liver (in which case it is termed

alcoholic steatohepatitis) (Lucey et al. 2009)—may occur at any stage of the disease process and significantly predisposes patients to developing cirrhosis.

The first stage in ALD, hepatic steatosis, involves several processes. Alcohol’s metabolism generates an overabundance of the metabolic intermediate nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in its reduced form (NADH), which stimulates the synthesis of excess fatty acids in the liver (Lieber 2004). In addition, recent evidence has shown significant involvement of innate immune pathways in steatosis (Mandrekar et al. 2011). This evidence points to substantial crosstalk between metabolic and immune pathways and highlights the multifactorial nature of this initial stage. Steatosis typically resolves with abstinence from alcohol in people who have no other conditions (e.g., obesity) that promote steatosis.

However, continued alcohol use may lead to alcoholic hepatitis, a moderate to severe disorder arising from acute alcohol-induced inflammation for which no highly effective treatment currently is available.

Chronic alcohol use may also lead to the development of fibrosis (Hernandez-Gea and Friedman 2011), characterized by the generation of scar tissue composed of extracellular matrix proteins, such as collagens. As

# Liver Cell Types and Their Roles in ALD

## Kupffer Cells

Kupffer cells are macrophages located in the liver sinusoids. They usually are among the first cells exposed to alcohol-induced, microbe-derived immunogenic challenges originating from the gut, including lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and peptidoglycans. Kupffer cells have a dual role in mediating pro-inflammatory responses and moderating these responses through expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines. They express Toll-like receptors (TLRs), including TLR4, TLR2, TLR3, and TLR9, which, on contact with LPS, lipoteichoic acid (a component of the cell walls in Gram-positive bacteria), viral RNA, and CpG-island DNA, respectively, trigger pro-inflammatory response pathways. For example, in response to LPS stimulation, Kupffer cells produce inflammatory cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα], interleukin [IL]-1β, IL-6, and IL-10) and several chemokines through the central regulator of inflammation, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB). Secretion of IL-12 and IL-18 activates production of interferon γ (IFN-γ) in natural killer cells, and production of transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1) and ROS contribute to alcohol-induced fibrogenesis in liver tissues. Kupffer cells contribute to liver tolerance by expressing anti-inflammatory IL-10 on exposure to LPS.

representing the major producers of extracellular matrix, which contributes to fibrosis.

## Hepatocytes

Hepatocytes are epithelial cells and the major cell type of the liver. They significantly contribute to elimination of inflammation-inducing LPS from circulating blood. LPS uptake by hepatocytes requires activity of the TLR4–CD14–MD-2 complex. Hepatocytes are the target for TNFα released by Kupffer cells in response to alcohol and LPS exposure and may undergo apoptosis or necrosis in response to TNFα receptor activation.

## Hepatic Dendritic Cells

Activation of TLR9 and TLR7 on or in specialized plasmacytoid dendritic cells results in production of IFN-α. Conventional dendritic cells of the liver respond to LPS or lipoteichoic acid via activation of TLR4 or TLR2 by producing TNFα, IL-12, or IL-6.

## Biliary Epithelial Cells

Biliary epithelial cells express TLRs 1 through 10 and exhibit activation of NF-κB expression and TNFα expression after stimulation with high doses of alcohol-induced LPS.

## Hepatic Stellate Cells

Hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) are activated by liver damage and express TLR2, TLR4, and TLR9, which respond to lipoteichoic acid, LPS, and CpG DNA, respectively. TLR stimulation in HSCs results in expression of IL-6, TGF-β1, and monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1). On activation, HSCs differentiate into myofibroblasts,

## Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells

Sinusoidal endothelial cells (SECs) line the hepatic sinusoids and express TLR4-CD14 along with TLR9. Exposing SECs to LPS downregulates NF-κB activation, CD54 expression, and leukocyte adhesion. In these cells, LPS tolerance is not controlled via TLR4 expression, and the role of SECs in uptake of LPS in the liver is unclear.
in steatosis, both aberrant metabolic processes and activation of immune responses play roles in the development and progression of fibrosis. Acetaldehyde generated during the oxidative breakdown of alcohol inhibits certain immune cells (i.e., natural killer cells) that normally moderate fibrosis by inducing apoptosis in activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) (Hernandez-Gea and Friedman 2011; Orman et al. 2013). In addition, cytokines secreted by Kupffer cells, as well as inflammatory scar–associated macrophages recruited from the periphery (Ramachandran and Iredale 2012), activate quiescent HSCs, resulting in the development and proliferation of extracellular matrix–producing myofibroblasts, whose activity precipitates fibrosis.

About 10 to 20 percent of patients with fibrosis who continue to heavily consume alcohol progress to the final stage of ALD, cirrhosis (Orman et al. 2013). This disease stage is characterized by widespread damage to the liver, including fibrotic deformation of tissues and blood vessels, as well as necrosis of cells. The main features of cirrhosis are the formation of nodules of varying sizes, which signify localized regeneration of lost tissues, and the obstruction of blood vessels, which causes portal hypertension. Release of immunogenic cellular debris from necrotic liver cells and the loss of the liver’s ability to clear microbial and other pro-inflammatory metabolites from the circulation results in unremitting stimulation of innate immune pathways. As a result, cirrhosis generally is associated with a poor prognosis, with a median survival time of about 10 years. Further, liver cancer (i.e., hepatocellular carcinoma) is seen in about 2 percent of patients with cirrhosis (Orman et al. 2013).

### Innate Immunity and ALD

As mentioned above, various innate immune cells and their actions play prominent and complex roles in the

initiation and progression of ALD. The oxidative breakdown of alcohol by dedicated alcohol dehydrogenases and by cytochrome P450 monooxygenases generates ROS that may damage proteins, lipids, and other cellular structures. In addition, alcohol’s breakdown metabolite, acetaldehyde, exerts toxic effects on cellular structures and DNA (Wang et al. 2012). The ROS- and acetaldehyde-induced cell damage activates innate immune cells, triggering an inflammatory reaction even in the absence of invading pathogens (i.e., sterile inflammation)

(Kubes and Mehal 2012). Sterile inflammation results from activation of pro-inflammatory pathways in immune and other cells carrying receptors for detecting damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs; also called alarmins). These molecules are released by stressed or necrotic cells, such as hepatocytes damaged by alcohol or its breakdown products. These immune pathways are essential for clearing damaged cells and cellular debris from tissues; however, their persistent activation by alcohol leads to repeated cycles of cell damage and

Figure 1 The role of innate immunity in the natural history of alcoholic liver disease (ALD). Heavy alcohol consumption causes release of bacterial products (i.e., lipopolysaccharides [LPSs]) from the gut into the bloodstream. These LPSs lead to activation of liver innate immunity by stimulating Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) signaling on Kupffer cells and hepatocytes. The damaging effects of alcohol and its metabolism on cells trigger additional immune responses. Steatosis and inflammation in hepatocytes represent the early stages of ALD; continued alcohol-induced inflammation leads to apoptosis/necrosis in hepatocytes. Downregulation of BMP and activin membrane–bound inhibitor (BAMBI) and increased transforming growth factor β (TGF-β) signaling activate hepatic stellate cells, which differentiate into myofibroblasts causing fibrosis. About 10 to 20 percent of patients with ALD (about 70 percent of patients with alcoholic hepatitis) progress to cirrhosis. Differentiation and proliferation of precancerous liver cells present in cirrhosis lead to cancer in about 10 percent of cirrhosis patients. Acute alcohol-induced inflammation (i.e., alcoholic hepatitis), characterized by high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin [IL]-17 and IL-8), may occur at any stage of ALD and, in severe cases, may cause death in about 50 percent of patients.

240 | Vol. 37, No. 2 Alcohol Research: Current Reviewsresultant stimulation of innate immune  
cells, causing chronic inflammation of  
the liver.  

Chronic alcohol intake also has  
more indirect effects that play a major  
role in ALD. Excessive alcohol consumption  
changes the composition of  
microbes found in the gut (i.e., the  
gut microbiome) and seems to contribute  
to loss of tight cellular connections  
in the small intestine (Rao 2009).  
This alcohol-induced breach of the gut  
barrier causes release of immunogenic  
compounds, primarily bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS, also known as  
endotoxin) (Bode et al. 1987) and  
other cell-wall constituents like peptidoglycans and microbial DNA, into  
the circulation. LPS is a major trigger  
of pro-inflammatory pathways, and its  
role in inflammation of the liver and  
stimulation of innate immunity is  
well established (Petrasek et al. 2013;  
Rao 2009; Seki and Schnabl 2012).  
Unmethylated CpG-containing  
DNAs released from bacterial cells have  
also emerged as a significant activator  
of liver innate immunity (Petrasek et  
al. 2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012).  

In addition, alcohol depletes the  
levels of S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)  
(Lieber 2000) a universal methyl  
donor important for epigenetic regulation  
of transcription. Intragastric feeding  
of SAM in rats diminished the activity  
of alcohol-activated innate immune  
pathways (Oliva et al. 2011), highlighting  
the potential role of SAM in moderating innate immune responses.  

### Effects on Kupffer Cells and the Complement System  

Kupffer cells are the resident macrophages of the liver and have key functions in innate immunity. Because of  
the crucial role Kupffer cells play in  
defending the liver against pathogens,  
they are among the first immune cells  
to respond to alcohol-induced surges  
of microbial metabolites, such as LPS.  
These bacterial products engage with  
the TLR4 receptors on the Kupffer  
cells. LPS-induced TLR4 activation  
stimulates the production of cytokines,  
including TNFα, IL-6, and IL-1β, and  
of chemokines, such as KC (CXCL1),  
MIP-2 (CXCL2), MCP-1 (CCL2),  
and RANTES (Gao et al. 2011;  
Mandrekar and Szabo 2009; Petrasek  
et al. 2013; Szabo et al. 2011). Secretion  
of these molecules from Kupffer cells,  
in turn, activates a pro-inflammatory  
cascade affecting processes in other  
liver cells. For example, tumor necrosis  
factor α (TNFα) secreted by activated  
Kupffer cells interacts with TNFα  
receptors on hepatocytes (see figures 2  
and 3). TNFα receptor activation, in  
turn, contributes to steatosis and, ultimately, to necrosis and apoptosis of the  
hepatocytes that normally clear LPS  
and other xenobiotic compounds from  
the liver (Gao et al. 2011). Alcohol also  
affects macrophage plasticity—the  
environmentally determined activation  
to either classical pro-inflammatory  
(i.e., M1) or alternative anti-inflammatory  
(i.e., M2) macrophages. Alcohol represses  
activation to the M2 phenotype and  
thus skews macrophage distributions  
toward the pro-inflammatory M1 state  
(Louvet et al. 2011; Mandal et al. 2011).  

The complement system is a major  
antimicrobial defense pathway that  
straddles both innate and adaptive  
immunity. Most of the proteins in  
this system are produced in the liver.  
Alcohol activates complement pathways (Cohen et al. 2010) and, in  
heavy drinkers, can also compromise  
complement action by impairing liver  
function. Complement activation  
results in the production of C3a and  
C5a anaphylatoxins—short peptides  
of the complement system. Through  
interactions with C3a and C5a receptors, these anaphylatoxins trigger the  
production of pro-inflammatory  
innate immune proteins, such as  
cytokines, in leukocytes and thus  
contribute to inflammation (Cohen  
et al. 2011) (see figures 2 and 4).  

### Expression and Activation of TLRs  

TLRs are expressed on many cells  
of the liver, including Kupffer cells,  
endothelial cells, dendritic cells, biliary  
epithelial cells, HSCs, and hepatocytes. The expression of the TLRs and  
their level of responsiveness on these  
different cells normally are adjusted  
to promote appropriate reactions  
to immune challenges and prevent  
misplaced and potentially damaging  
responses (Petrasek et al. 2013).  
Alcohol exposure turns up the dial  
of this finely tuned TLR network,  
heightening TLR responses to external  
and internal triggers, such as pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)  
and DAMPs, respectively (Petrasek et  
al. 2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012).  

TLR4 plays a very prominent role  
in alcohol-induced inflammation,  
activating two distinct signaling  
pathways—the myeloid differentiation  
primary response gene 88 (MyD88)-dependent pathway and the MyD88-independent pathway (Petrasek et al.  
2013; Seki and Schnabl 2012; Wang  
et al. 2012). Engagement of the  
MyD88-dependent TLR pathway  
triggers expression of nuclear factor  
kappa B (NF-κB), a central transcriptional regulator of immune responses  
and pro-inflammatory pathways.  
TLR4-mediated, MyD88-dependent  
signaling also promotes mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-induced production of cytokines,  
including TNFα. The MyD88-independent pathway proceeds via a different major adaptor protein, TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF), and results in production of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), type I interferons (IFNs), and pro-inflammatory cytokines.  

Experiments in rodent models of  
ALD have demonstrated that TLR4-TRIF signaling plays an essential role  
in alcohol-induced activation of TLR4  
in Kupffer cells (Hritz et al. 2008;  
Mandal et al. 2010b) (see figure 2).  
Moreover, TLR4 signaling in both  
immune cells (i.e., Kupffer cells) and  
nonimmune cells involved in tissue  
repair (i.e., HSCs) is required for the  
development of alcoholic hepatitis  
and fibrosis (Inokuchi et al. 2011).  
Co-receptor proteins (e.g., cluster of  
differentiation [CD] 14 and myeloid  
differentiation [MD] 2) influence the  
responsiveness of TLR4 to receptor ligands, such as LPS.

**Cytokines and Chemokines in ALD**

Cytokines are relatively small proteins (i.e., less than 30 kDa in size), many of which are produced by various cells in response to injury or contact with pathogens. Patients with ALD often have elevated levels of various cytokines (see sidebar, “Key Cytokines and Hormonal Peptides in ALD”) (Szabo et al. 2011). The cytokines are key components of the innate immune system, facilitating cell-to-cell communication and regulating proliferation and maturation of cell populations in response to immune challenges and environmental changes. Cytokines engage with cells via specific receptors on the cellular surfaces, sometimes triggering their own (i.e., autocrine) production in the cells or amplifying or inhibiting the activities of other cytokines. These interactive cytokine networks play an indispensable role in mediating innate immune responses, and their relative contributions define the different types and outcomes of these responses. A subset of cytokines, the chemokines, recruit immune cells, such as neutrophils and lymphocytes, to sites of injury or infection; thus, chemokines are often involved in pro-inflammatory signaling pathways.

As can be expected from alcohol’s effect on the innate immune cells of the liver, such as Kupffer cells, and on LPS-activated TLR signaling, heavy alcohol consumption stimulates the production of many cytokines. One of the major cytokines in ALD and one of the first to be associated with the condition is TNFα (McClain and Cohen 1989). TNFα is expressed early in response to alcohol exposure, and its production coincides with liver damage; moreover, abolishing its expression in animal models of ALD mitigates liver injury (Gao 2012; Wang et al. 2012). These observations underscore that TNFα’s prominent pro-inflammatory role in ALD and its

activity significantly contributes to alcohol-induced liver damage.

Interleukins are also among the pro-inflammatory cytokines implicated in ALD. For example, TNFα, along with other NF-κB–induced agents, stimulates the expression of IL-8, whose levels are greatly increased in alcoholic hepatitis (Sheron et al. 1993). IL-17 is also upregulated in ALD, and although its activity is lower than that of TNFα, it seems to play a role in both inflammation and fibrosis of the liver (Lemmers et al. 2009).

Alcohol exposure also induces expression of anti-inflammatory cytok-

![Figure 2](image.png)

**Figure 2** Alcohol’s effects on pro-inflammatory pathways in liver macrophages (i.e., Kupffer cells). Excessive alcohol consumption increases the permeability of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, exposing Kupffer cells to bacterial endotoxin (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). LPS is bound by LPS-binding protein (LBP), enabling engagement with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR 4) and activating the myeloid differentiation primary response (MyD) 88-independent signaling pathway involving interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and TIR domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-β (TRIF). IRF3–TRIF signaling induces production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases and activates nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and histone acetylation, which trigger transcription of genes for several pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., tumor necrosis factor α [TNFα] and interleukin [IL]-17). Alcohol’s breakdown to acetaldehyde and acetate also stimulates ROS signaling and cytokine production. In addition, IRF3–TRIF signaling and detection of damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs or alarmins) released from hepatocytes after alcohol exposure stimulate the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex containing caspase 1, which cleaves and thus activates another pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β. Alcohol activates complement, generating anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, which dock with their cognate receptor on Kupffer cells, further stimulating cytokine production.

kines. For example, three interleukins—IL-6, IL-10, and IL-22—activate signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), a transcriptional regulator of an array of genes involved in immunity and cellular defenses and differentiation (Gao 2012; Wang et al. 2012). IL-22 binds to specific receptors on epithelial cells and on hepatocytes and triggers the expression of anti-apoptotic and anti-oxidative stress genes while repressing genes involved

in lipid production (Gao 2012; Wang et al. 2012). It often remains unclear whether the expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines reflects a compensatory response of the immune system to the alcohol-induced upregulation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines or to the cell damage alcohol produces.

Interestingly, although IL-6, IL-10, and IL-22 all stimulate STAT3, only IL-22 seems to have solely anti-inflammatory effects

protecting against acute and chronic liver damage (Park et al. 2011). IL-6 and IL-10, in contrast, have dual roles as both pro- and anti-inflammatory proteins in ALD (Gao 2012; Wang et al. 2012). Their specific effects seem to be determined by the cell type affected and the stage of ALD. For example, IL-6 increases the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in Kupffer cells (Gao 2012), but its activity also protects hepatocytes. Recent findings suggest that alcohol-induced oxidative stress stimulates the expression of IL-6, promoting senescence in hepatocytes, which, in turn, makes cells more resistant to steatosis and apoptosis (Wan et al. 2014). IL-10 blocks the activation of TNFα and complement, thus reducing expression of pro-inflammatory pathways; but it also checks expression of IL-6, thus limiting liver regeneration afforded by IL-6–induced upregulation of expression of liver-protective genes (Gao 2012).

Chemokines also play critical roles in alcohol-induced inflammation. For example, the levels of MCP-1 (also known as CCL2) are elevated in patients with ALD, and upregulated MCP-1 expression is also observed in Kupffer cells and hepatocytes of alcohol-fed mice (Mandrekar et al. 2011). Feeding alcohol to MCP-1–deficient mice results in less steatosis, lower expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., of TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6), and lower levels of oxidative stress than in wild-type mice (Mandrekar et al. 2011). Moreover, MCP-1 is required for activating cytokine expression in response to LPS (Mandrekar et al. 2011). In patients with ALD, increased MCP-1 expression is associated with increased disease severity and elevated levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 (Dégre et al. 2012). One major role of MCP-1 in ALD is to recruit neutrophils to inflamed liver tissues. However, because circulating neutrophils in the ALD patients lack MCP-1 receptors (Dégre et al. 2012), the exact mechanisms by which MCP-1 exerts its control over neutrophil movement remain to be elucidated.


Figure 3 Alcohol’s direct effects on activity and viability of parenchymal liver cells (i.e., hepatocytes) and on immune-cell signaling to hepatocytes. Excessive alcohol consumption increases the permeability of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, exposing hepatocytes to bacterial endotoxin (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]). LPS is bound by LPS-binding protein (LBP), enabling engagement with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and activation of pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. TLR4 signaling activates expression of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which, along with reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated in mitochondria (as a result of exposure to the toxic alcohol-breakdown product acetaldehyde) and Kupffer cells, activates transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-8). Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) produced by activated Kupffer cells stimulates sterol regulatory element–binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c), which triggers expression of genes in lipid synthesis, in turn initiating the development of abnormal fat deposition (i.e., steatosis). The combined action of lipid synthesis and upregulated expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines may spur programmed cell death (i.e., apoptosis) and necrosis, resulting in alcohol-induced loss of hepatocytes from tissues

Nevertheless, these results connect chemokines to lipid metabolism in the liver and suggest that MCP-1 plays a major role in alcohol-induced liver inflammation by activating several pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to common triggers of ALD and by promoting neutrophil infiltration into liver tissues.

Barnes and colleagues (2013) recently demonstrated that macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF)—a multifunctional pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine, which also has some hormonal features—has a critical role in both the early and chronic stages of liver injury in a mouse model of ALD. MIF-deficient mice are protected against several of alcohol’s effects on the innate immune system, including inflammation, and also against hepatocyte damage and apoptosis. Similar to MCP-1, MIF plays a role in alcohol-induced lipid accumulation in liver cells (Barnes et al. 2013), suggesting a role for both chemokines in regulating lipid metabolism directly or indirectly. The findings lend further support to existing evidence that links innate immune pathways and proteins to the regulation of fundamental metabolic processes.

The effect of the hormonal peptide adiponectin on innate immunity, specifically on anti-inflammatory cytokine production and activity, is also worth noting. Adiponectin is secreted by fat cells (i.e., adipocytes) and has been shown to alleviate steatosis, inflammation, and liver damage in animal models (Xu et al. 2003). Recent evidence suggests that adiponectin moderates alcohol-induced production of pro-inflammatory TNFα and promotes expression of IL-10 (Mandal et al. 2010a). Because IL-10 activates STAT3, its activation by adiponectin lowers inflammation by stimulating STAT3-induced expression of anti-inflammatory genes in myeloid cells, such as Kupffer cells. In addition, adiponectin stimulates heme oxygenase 1 (HO-1), which suppresses the pro-inflammatory TLR4-dependent/

### Key Cytokines and Hormonal Peptides in ALD

#### Tumor Necrosis Factor α
Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) is a major pro-inflammatory cytokine whose levels are increased in the blood and liver of individuals with alcoholic liver disease (ALD). TNFα expression is regulated by the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB). It is upregulated in macrophages (i.e., Kupffer cells) as well as in circulating monocytes in response to Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) activation by bacterial endotoxin (i.e., lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) and by the breakdown products of alcohol, acetaldehyde and acetic acid. TNFα induces necrosis and apoptosis in hepatocytes, thus contributing to inflammation in ALD. TNFα repression by the phosphodiester-inhibitor pentoxifylline and by treatment with TNFα antibody alleviates TNFα-induced liver damage in mice and improves the short-term survival of ALD patients, respectively, but increases the risk for infections in ALD patients.

#### Interleukin 1β
Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) along with type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), and IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra), is an important regulator of the IL-1 signaling complex. This complex plays a critical role in alcohol-induced hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and damage. IL-1β activation is mediated through the inflammasome, a multiprotein complex in macrophages that senses and transduces endogenous danger signals via IL-1β cleavage by caspase-1.

#### IL-6
IL-6 has both pro- and anti-inflammatory activities. It increases expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages and decreases necrosis-associated inflammation in hepatocytes, which aids recovery from injury and facilitates tissue regeneration. Along with IL-10 and IL-22, IL-6 activates signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), which controls expression of a set of genes involved in innate immunity and in cell survival and differentiation. IL-6 release from M2 macrophages induces senescence and blocks apoptosis and steatosis in hepatocytes in the early stage of alcohol-induced liver injury in mice. IL-6 activates STAT3 in sinusoidal endothelial cells of the liver, thereby increasing cell survival. IL-6 levels, along with those of IL-8 and IL-10, are increased in patients with ALD who have no clinical signs of liver disease.

#### IL-8
IL-8 is released from injured hepatocytes and has important pro-inflammatory roles as a chemokine that recruits neutrophils to sites of inflammation. Its expression is
MyD88-independent pathway in  
Kupffer cells (Mandal et al. 2010b).  
Alcohol-induced oxidative stress  
decreases secretion of adiponectin by  
adipocytes (Tang et al. 2012), which  
links oxidative stress to decreased levels  
of liver-protective, anti-inflammatory  
hormones, representing yet another  
mechanism by which alcohol perturbs  
liver innate immunity.  

Another small peptide, ghrelin,  
which is produced mainly in the gut  
but also in the liver, has been shown  
to promote antifibrotic and hepato-  
protective effects in both animals and  
humans with hepatic fibrosis (Moreno  
et al. 2010). Ghrelin decreases activa-  
tion of NF-κB in hepatocytes, which  
attenuates apoptotic signaling in these  

cells. It also limits expression of collagen-  
α1 and TGF-β1 but not of NF-κB  
and IL-8 in HSCs, indicating that  
ghrelin protects liver tissues mainly by  
suppressing fibrogenic activities in  
liver cells (Moreno et al. 2010).  

### Activation of the Inflammasome  
and IL-1β Expression  

Recent observations by Petrasek and  
colleagues (2012) in a mouse model  
of alcoholic hepatitis support significant  
involvement of another important  
cytokine, IL-1β—which has  
roles in rheumatoid arthritis and  
autoimmune disorders—in alcohol-  
induced inflammation. The researchers show that the IL-1β signaling  

complex is essential for the initiation  
of alcohol-induced inflammation and  
progression to liver fibrosis. IL-1β is  
activated through the inflammasome,  
a large protein assembly composed of  
NOD-like receptor proteins that sense  
alarmins, the caspase-1 (Casp-1)  
protein (an enzyme that cleaves other  
proteins to activate them), and an  
apoptosis-associated speck-like  
CARD-domain-containing (ASC)  
protein (Szabo and Csak 2012) (see  
figures 2 and 3). The inflammasome  
is activated in Kupffer cells of alcohol-  
fed mice (Petrasek et al. 2012) as well  
as in hepatocytes exposed to LPS and  
fatty acids (Csak et al. 2011). It is  
stimulated by intracellular signals  
such as alarmins, which engage with  

induced by TNFα via activation through NF-κB. IL-8  
levels are greatly increased in people with acute alcoholic  
hepatitis but are only moderately upregulated in those  
with cirrhosis. IL-8 levels, along with those for IL-6 and  
IL-10, are elevated in individuals with alcoholism who  
have no signs of liver disease.  

### IL-10  

IL-10 is a strong suppressor of inflammation by preventing  
production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines  
TNFα, IL-1β, and IL-6 in macrophages. However, its  
anti-inflammatory, hepatoprotective effects are contingent  
on the expression of other cytokines, and its inhibitory  
effect on IL-6 expression can delay liver regeneration and  
increase steatosis. IL-10 expression is moderately to highly  
increased in ALD and, along with that of IL-6 and IL-8,  
is also upregulated in alcoholic patients without signs of  
liver disease. IL-10 acts only on immune cells expressing  
its cognate receptors and facilitates sustained activation  
of the transcription factor STAT3 in Kupffer cells, thus  
inhibiting inflammation. IL-10 also inhibits fibrosis.  

### IL-17  

IL-17 is a recently discovered, pro-inflammatory chemo-  
kine whose levels are increased in people with ALD. It is  
produced by monocytes and T cells and plays an impor-  
tant role in recruiting neutrophils to inflamed liver tissues.  
It may act in concert with TNFα to activate NF-κB,  

thereby inducing expression of other pro-inflammatory  
cytokines. IL-17’s main targets are hepatic stellate cells  
(HSCs), in which it induces production of pro-inflammatory  
IL-8. IL-17 is also thought to be involved in the develop-  
ment of fibrosis.  

### IL-22  

IL-22 is an anti-inflammatory cytokine whose expression  
limits steatosis and liver damage. The IL-22 targets are  
hepatocytes in which it activates the transcription factor  
STAT3. The antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and antisteatotic  
actions of IL-22 make it a promising target of interven-  
tions for treating ALD with minimal side effects because  
of the restricted distribution of IL-22 receptors.  

### Adiponectin  

Adiponectin is an adipokine, a peptide hormone, whose  
secretion from fat cells (i.e., adipocytes) is inhibited by  
alcohol. Adiponectin increases fatty acid oxidation and  
thus suppresses steatosis. It also decreases expression of the  
pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-α in macrophages (i.e.,  
Kupffer cells) by inducing expression of heme oxygenase  
1 (HO-1), which decreases TLR4/MyD88-independent  
signaling, and by increasing polarization to anti-  
inflammatory M2 macrophages. In addition, adiponectin  
upregulates expression of anti-inflammatory IL-10.  pattern-recognition domains of the  
NOD-like receptors.  

Inflammasome activity in Kupffer  
cells promotes Casp-1–mediated  
cleavage, and thus activation, of IL-1β  
(Petrasek et al. 2012). Blocking IL-1β  
activity strongly decreases liver inflam-  
mation and damage (Petrasek et al.  
2012). These findings further amplify  
the view that IL-1β acts as a pro-  
inflammatory cytokine in immune  
cells in ALD and that IL-1β signaling  
through the inflammasome is required  
for alcohol-induced liver injury.  
Coupled with the observations of  
Mandrekar and colleagues (2011) on  
MCP-1, these findings also establish  
a link between innate immune activity  
and steatosis. This association is further  
supported by the observation that  
steatosis can be prevented when innate  
immune responses are experimentally  
abrogated by checking IL-1β or MCP-1  
activity. Additional investigations into  
pro-inflammatory signaling in the  
methyl-choline deficiency model of  
non-alcoholic steatohepatitis have  
indicated that activation of the inflam-  
masome and generation of IL-1β are  
independent of TLR4 but contingent  
on the MyD88-dependent pathway  
(Csak et al. 2014).  

Cytokine Effects on Hepatocytes  
and HSCs  

Alcohol-induced increases in LPS  
stimulate TNFα production and its  
release primarily from Kupffer cells  
(McClain and Cohen 1989; Wang et  
al. 2012). In addition, alcohol sensi-  
tizes other liver cells to TNFα’s  
actions (An et al. 2012). One distinct  
role of TNFα is to induce programmed  
cell-death pathways (i.e., apoptosis  
and necroptosis) by binding to and  
activating death receptors on cells.  
Activation of these receptors results  
in the expression of pro-apoptotic or  
necroptotic mediators (e.g., caspases  
and receptor-interacting proteins).  
Alcohol thus has profound effects on  
cell viability by activating the expres-  
sion of cytotoxic cytokines and increas-  
ing cell sensitivity to the actions of  

these cytokines. For instance, whereas  
hepatocytes in healthy people are not  
highly sensitive to TNFα activation of  
death receptor pathways, alcohol primes  
cells for the TNFα-mediated stimula-  
tion of cell-death pathways (Pastorino  
and Hoek 2000).  

TNFα binds to and activates two  
receptors—TNF-R1 and TNF-R2—  
and the outcome of their activation  
hinges on the relative levels of stimula-  
tion of three main pathways: a pro-  
apoptotic pathway, a pro-necroptotic  
pathway, and a cell-survival pathway  
(Vanden Berghe et al. 2014). Binding  
to TNF-R1 activates apoptotic and  
necrotic pathways through a signaling  
cascade involving multiple proteins,  
including TNF-R1–associated death  
domain protein (TRADD); TNF  
receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2);  
and caspases 8, 3, and 7. TNF-R1  
activation also may result in the stim-  
ulation of a cell-survival pathway  
involving NF-κB. In contrast, activa-  
tion of TNF-R2 stimulates only cell  
survival (Malhi et al. 2010).  

Apoptosis is an important regula-  
tory mechanism for controlling the  
size of cell populations (e.g., neutro-  
phils) or to avoid unchecked prolifera-  
tion of abnormal cells. However,  
apoptosis triggered via the action of  
alcohol-induced TNFα on, for exam-  
ple, hepatocytes can severely impair  
liver function. Recent evidence also  
indicates that chronic ethanol feeding  
can activate necroptotic cell-death  
pathways in hepatocytes. Mice in  
which an important necroptotic  
regulator—receptor-interacting  
protein kinase (RIP)-3—is inactivated  
are protected from alcohol-induced  
liver injury (Roychowdhury et al.  
2013). Hepatocytes are the major  
cell type in the liver and, along with  
Kupffer cells, eliminate most of the  
LPS from circulation. Widespread  
apoptosis and necrosis of hepatocytes  
therefore increase levels of circulating  
LPS, which in turn fuels further  
inflammation through activation of  
TLR4 on Kupffer cells and ultimately  
escalates the release of pro-apoptotic  
TNFα. This helps explain why  

patients with severe liver disease (i.e.,  
cirrhosis) often show high levels of  
LPS in the blood (i.e., endotoxemia),  
resulting in sepsis (Bode et al. 1987).  
Persistent alcohol-induced activa-  
tion of cytokines in immune cells such  
as Kupffer cells also promotes fibrosis.  
Production and secretion of trans-  
forming growth factor (TGF)-β and  
of platelet-derived growth factor  
(PDGF) from Kupffer cells or from  
inflammatory scar–associated macro-  
phages activates HSCs (see figure 4),  
triggering them to develop into myofi-  
broblasts. Moreover, HSCs may be  
further activated by engulfing apop-  
totic hepatocytes. HSCs express a  
number of receptors involved in  
innate immunity, including the C5a  
receptor, whose ligand, C5a, is a  
potent mitogen that may stimulate  
HSC migration (Das et al. 2014).  
HSCs also express TLR4, which  
senses LPS. Although LPS alone  
cannot activate HSCs, its action via  
TLR4 downregulates expression of  
BMP and activin membrane-bound  
inhibitor (BAMBI), thereby sensitiz-  
ing the cells to activation by TGF-β  
(Liu et al. 2014; Seki et al. 2007).  
BAMBI is a pseudoreceptor, which in  
quiescent HSCs diminishes TGF-β’s  
activity by binding to it without trig-  
gering intracellular TGF-β signaling.  
As shown by Seki and colleagues  
(2007), decreased BAMBI expression  
sensitizes HSCs to TGF-β activation,  
and LPS-induced TLR4 activation  
stimulates chemokine secretion along  
with recruitment and activation of  
Kupffer cells. Moreover, LPS activates  
TLR4 signaling in HSCs through the  
MyD88-dependent NF-κB pathway,  
demonstrating involvement of this key  
innate immune pathway in fibrosis  
and recruitment of immune cells.  
NF-κB directly binds the BAMBI  
promoter, along with histone deacetyl-  
ase (HDAC) 1, thus repressing  
BAMBI expression and promoting  
TGF-β activation (Liu et al. 2014).  
Activated HSCs produce and secrete  
extracellular matrix proteins (i.e., colla-  
gens), resulting in fibrogenesis  
(Hernandez-Gea and Friedman 2011;  
Seki and Schnabl 2012). Although fibrogenesis is essential for normal tissue repair, its dysregulation by recurrent activation of cytokines acting on HSCs precipitates inflammatory fibrosis. This stage of ALD involves the formation of scar tissue,

which interferes with normal tissue function and often results in portal hypertension (Hernandez-Gea and Friedman 2011). Another cytokine pathway involving HSCs and leading to fibrosis in ALD patients involves IL-17. This cytokine, which is produced

by peripheral blood cells (i.e., Th17 lymphocytes) in patients with alcoholic hepatitis and cirrhosis, stimulates its cognate receptors on HSCs (Lemmers et al. 2009). In response, the cells secrete IL-8 and growth-related oncogene (GRO)-α, recruiting neutrophils to their tissue, resulting in localized pro-inflammatory immune-cell infiltrates and fibrosis scores closely correlated with IL-17 levels.

Together, these findings indicate that cytokines produced by immune cells, such as TNFα produced by Kupffer cells and IL-17 produced by Th-17 lymphocytes, play a major role in ALD by affecting the viability and function of hepatocytes and by activating quiescent HSCs to produce excess extracellular proteins. These observations thus provide critical insight into the molecular processes and mechanisms that produce liver damage and fibrosis in ALD.

### Epigenetic Effects

Alcohol exerts additional effects on the innate immune system, for example, by producing epigenetic changes in the expression of genes for pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways (Curtis et al. 2013). Epigenetic changes affect the activity at gene promoters or entire gene regions and can have long-term and even heritable effects on gene expression without altering the underlying DNA sequence. Three main mechanisms operate in epigenetics:

- **DNA methyltransferases**, using SAM as methyl donor, methylate a cytosine nucleotide at CpG-rich regions (i.e., CpG islands) in the DNA of gene promoters, which decreases expression of the downstream genes.
- **Methylation, acetylation, phosphorylation, ubiquitination, or sumoylation** of the proteins around which DNA is coiled (i.e., histones) alters accessibility

NOTES: C5aR = C5a receptor; CD14 = cluster of differentiation 14 protein; MD-2 = myeloid differentiation 2 protein; TNFαR = TNFα receptor.
of the transcriptional proteins to  
the DNA.

- Some investigators are now extending  
  the concept of epigenetics to  
  include transcriptional regulation  
  by microRNAs (miRNAs). These  
  molecules regulate the expression  
  of mRNAs with which they share  
  similar sequences (Curtis et al. 2013).

The study of alcohol's effects on  
epigenetic regulation and of the mechanisms by which alcohol exerts these  
effects has been a rapidly emerging  
field over the past decade. Insight  
gleaned from initial studies has shown  
that alcohol can interfere with the  
fundamental processes of epigenetic  
regulation in people with ALD as well  
as in animal models of the disease or  
in cultured human cells exposed to  
alcohol or its metabolic byproducts  
(reviewed by Kruman and Fowler  
2014; Mandrekar 2011; Shukla and  
Lim 2013).

Studies in animals and in human  
cells lines have demonstrated that  
alcohol and LPS increase the expression  
of microRNA-34a, which helps  
alleviate alcohol-induced apoptosis in  
hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells  
by targeting caspase 2 and sirtuin 1.  
The elevated expression of miRNA-  
34a is the result of an alcohol-  
induced decrease in methylation  
(i.e., hypomethylation) at a CpG  
island in the miRNA-34a promoter  
(Meng et al. 2012).

Alcohol also alters the cellular levels  
of SAM and of histone acetyltransferases  
(HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs),  
whose activities make DNA more or  
less accessible, respectively, to gene  
transcription. For example, the  
histone deacetylase HDAC1 has been  
shown to play a critical role in the  
silenced expression in HSCs of the  
fibrosis-attenuating protein BAMBI  
(see figure 4) (Liu et al. 2014). In  
addition, chemical inhibition of HDAC  
activity seems to reduce inflammation  
by reversing an alcohol-induced  
perturbation in macrophage polarization  
that results in a greater proportion of  

pro-inflammatory (M1) macrophages  
(Curtis et al. 2013). Oxidative stress  
caused by alcohol metabolism also  
triggers epigenetic changes, and alcohol-  
induced release of LPS and activation  
of TLR4 affects both HAT and  
HDAC activities, resulting in epigenetic  
changes in DNA regions containing  
genes for pro-inflammatory cytokines  
(Curtis et al. 2013).

### Approaches for Resolving  
#### Alcohol-Induced Liver  
##### Inflammation

Standard interventions for treating  
ALD depend on the stage and severity  
of the disease and typically include  
counseling abstinence from alcohol  
use; administration of corticosteroids  
(to inhibit alcohol-induced, pro-  
inflammatory pathways) and nutritional support for alcoholic hepatitis;  
and, in advanced cases, liver transplantation  
(Gao and Bataller 2011; Orman  
et al. 2013). Although rates of disability  
and death caused by ALD remain  
high despite these interventions, such  
treatments can significantly improve  
quality of life and avert early death  
caused by ALD. Overturning earlier  
assumptions about the persistence of  
alcohol-induced liver damage, recent  
studies have reported that some of  
the tissue injuries present even in the  
advanced stages of ALD, such as fibrosis, are reversible (Hernandez-Gea and  
Friedman 2011). This makes the discovery of new treatments that can augment  
existing ones even more urgent.

Recognition of the central role of  
innate immunity in ALD has spurred  
research into modulating the activity  
of key immune cells and cytokines. To  
this end, the discovery of the central  
role of TNFα in promoting inflammation in ALD prompted studies in  
which antibodies against TNFα were  
used to alleviate alcohol-induced  
inflammation. TNFα antibodies indeed  
significantly dampen liver inflammation (Gao 2012), but because TNFα is  
critical to fighting microbial pathogens,  

this approach often increases the risk  
for serious infections in ALD patients.  
The limitations of the above approach  
highlight that cytokine-based interventions will need to be carefully calibrated according to the activity profile  
and radius of action of each cytokine  
to minimize or prevent adverse effects.  
For instance, exploitation of the hepatoprotective properties of IL-6 is  
limited by the abundance of IL-6  
receptors in many tissues, potentially  
resulting in off-target effects. However,  
as proposed by Gao (2012), using  
IL-6 in ex vivo treatment of donor  
livers to reverse minor organ damage  
(e.g., steatosis) before transplantation  
into ALD patients could have some  
utility.

Current approaches for interventions in vivo focus on those immune  
regulators that target only a few cells  
or tissues. As discussed previously,  
IL-22 has an array of hepatoprotective  
activities, including antioxidant, antimicrobial, and antiapoptotic effects.  
Moreover, expression of the IL-22  
receptor, IL-22R, is confined to  
epithelial cells, such as hepatocytes.  
This has led to the proposition that  
combining the use of IL-22 with  
anti-inflammatory corticosteroids  
and TNFα inhibitors could offset the  
immunosuppressing effects of these  
two agents and promote recovery of  
liver tissues (Gao 2012). However,  
because evidence from animal models  
suggests that IL-22 may play a role in  
the development of hepatic carcinoma  
(Park et al. 2011), such use would be  
restricted to ALD patients who do  
not have cirrhosis (which may contain  
precancerous cells) or liver cancer  
(Gao 2012).

The discovery of the role of epigenetic factors in the development of ALD  
and their effects on immune cells and  
responses opens the way to possible  
interventions that target key epigenetic regulators and processes in ALD.  
For example, because HDAC1 seems  
to make HSCs more receptive to the  
fibrosis-inducing action of TGFβ (Liu  
et al. 2014), inactivation of HDAC1  
via antibodies or chemical agents may  
augment current treatments for halting or reversing fibrosis in patients with ALD. In addition, chemical inactivation of HDACs involved in alcohol's effects on macrophage polarization to pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages may help reduce inflammation, steatosis, and fibrosis in tissues. Thus, HDAC inhibitors or activators of HATs that prevent or reverse the effects of HDACs may someday prove useful in the treatment of ALD.

Finally, technological advances to sequence and analyze DNA of patients has helped identify key genetic variants such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes involved in liver diseases (Guo et al. 2009; Singal et al. 2014). Although in its early stages and not yet fully extended to the specific etiology of ALD, genetic profiling of ALD patients for SNP variants in genes involved in innate immune pathways could help identify patients vulnerable to advanced stages of ALD (e.g., cirrhosis) (Guo et al. 2009). Such personalized-medicine approaches could significantly improve the success and cost-effectiveness of current treatments and spur development of new interventions for ALD.

### Conclusions

Innate immunity plays a central role in ALD, and recent studies have uncovered several pivotal molecular mechanisms underlying alcohol's effects on the immune system of the liver. Excessive consumption of alcohol alters the characteristics and composition of the microbiome in the GI tract and increases translocation of bacteria and bacterial products, such as LPS and peptidoglycans, from the gut via the portal system to the liver. This increased influx of LPS, along with the direct effects of alcohol on immune cells and liver tissues, activates innate immune pathways. This activation occurs via stimulation of TLRs and through sensors of cell damage on or in the immune cells of the liver, such as Kupffer cells. These processes lead to the production of several pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., of TNFα, IL-1β, IL-8, and IL-17), triggering steatosis in hepatocytes and inducing fibrogenic pathways in HSCs. Moreover, production of chemokines, such as MCP-1 and MIF, leads to the infiltration of liver tissues by monocytes, neutrophils, and dendritic cells whose activities can further increase inflammation and impede recovery. Alcohol and its metabolic breakdown products acetaldehyde and acetate, along with ROS produced during alcohol metabolism, generate oxidative stress and affect epigenetic regulation that trigger activation of pro-inflammatory pathways such as polarization to M1 macrophages.

The insight gleaned from these complex interactions and pathways may provide the impetus for devising treatments using pro- or anti-inflammatory cytokines that act on defined cell types or employing agents that control epigenetic regulators to expand currently available interventions for treating ALD.
