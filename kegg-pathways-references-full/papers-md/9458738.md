Freeman, Ernest J., Mary L. Ruehr, and Robert V. Dorman. ANG II-induced translocation of cytosolic PLA₂ to the nucleus in vascular smooth muscle cells. *Am. J. Physiol.* 274 (Cell Physiol. 43): C282–C288, 1998.—The accumulation of radiolabeled arachidonic acid (AA), immunoblot analysis of subcellular fractions, and immunofluorescence tagging of proteins in intact cells were used to examine the coupling of ANG II receptors with the activity and location of a cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (cPLA₂) in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC). ANG II induced the accumulation of AA, which peaked by 10 min and was downregulated by 20 min. A large proportion of the AA released in response to ANG II was due to the activation of a Ca²⁺-dependent lipase coupled to an AT₁ receptor. However, regulation of Ca²⁺ availability failed to completely block AA release, and a small but significant reduction in ANG II-mediated AA release was observed in the presence of an AT₂ antagonist. These findings, coupled with a 25% reduction in the ANG II-induced AA release by an inhibitor specific for a Ca²⁺-independent PLA₂, are consistent with the presence and activation of a Ca²⁺-independent PLA₂. In contrast, immunoblot analysis and immunofluorescence detection showed that the ANG II-mediated translocation of cPLA₂ to a membrane fraction was exclusively AT₁ dependent and regulated by Ca²⁺ availability. Furthermore, the nucleus was the membrane target. We conclude that ANG II regulates the Ca²⁺-dependent activation and translocation of cPLA₂ through an AT₁ receptor and that this event is targeted at the nucleus in VSMC.

ANGIOTENSIN (ANG) II is a potent vasoconstrictor that stimulates the growth of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) (12, 38). There is interest in the proliferative effects of this hormone in VSMC, since growth of these cells within the arterial intima plays a role in vascular occlusive disorders, such as atherosclerosis and restenosis. Involvement of ANG II in these processes has been documented using ANG-converting enzyme inhibitors and selective antagonists of the AT₁ receptor subtype (11, 31). Although the signal transduction system that couples ANG II receptors with proliferative responses is uncertain, a variety of biochemical pathways respond to ANG II in these cells. For example, ANG II stimulates phospholipase C (PLC), which results in the formation of diacylglycerols (DAG) and inositol trisphosphates (16). The production of these lipid metabolites appears to be coupled to the ANG II-dependent activation of protein kinase C (PKC) (17) and the mobilization of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores (13, 36). Consistent with its actions as a growth factor, ANG II also increases mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activity and stimulates transcriptional processes (34, 37).

ANG II also stimulates the release of the second messenger arachidonic acid (AA) from phospholipid substrates in many cell types, including pituitary cells (1), renal epithelial cells (19), and VSMC (10). Although some of this AA may be derived from the deacylation of DAG (28) or from the activation of a Ca²⁺-independent phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂) (19, 23), there is substantial evidence that the receptor-dependent accumulation of AA depends on the activation of a cytosolic form of PLA₂ (cPLA₂) (3), which has been identified in a variety of cell types, including VSMC (32). In general, cPLA₂ is characterized by a high molecular mass (80–160 kDa), activation by micromolar concentrations of Ca²⁺, selectivity for AA at the sn-2 position of the glycerolipid (2, 6), and potent inhibition by arachidonyl trifluoromethyl ketone (AACOCF₃) (4, 15). Phosphorylation of cPLA₂ by PKC (32, 33) or MAP kinase (25, 26) may be required for full activation of this enzyme (35), but effective activation involves translocation of the enzyme from the cytosol to its substrates located in a target membrane (8).

A variety of agonists have been shown to stimulate cPLA₂, including platelet-derived growth factor and other mitogens in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells (25, 26), thrombin in platelets (21), acetylcholine in astrocytoma cells (5), and ANG II in vascular endothelial cells (30). To date, this has not been shown for ANG II in VSMC. In addition, ANG II-dependent translocation of cPLA₂ to a membrane target has not been shown in VSMC, but the target has been demonstrated to be the nucleus in vascular endothelial cells (30).

The purpose of the work described here was to link the activity and location of cPLA₂ with the activation of ANG II receptors in VSMC. The activity of the enzyme was measured as the release of [³H]AA from prelabeled cells, and localization of the enzyme was determined using both immunoblot analysis of isolated proteins and immunofluorescence detection of cPLA₂ in intact cells. ANG II stimulated the activity of the enzyme and its translocation to the nucleus. Both of these effects depended on the activation of the AT₁ receptor and the presence of Ca²⁺, while [³H]AA release was blocked by AACOCF₃. These results are consistent with a role for cPLA₂ in the transduction of the ANG II signal in VSMC.

### METHODS

**VSMC culture.** VSMC were isolated from rat thoracic aorta by explant culture, as previously described (14). Cells were identified as VSMC by their characteristic morphology, as well as with antibodies to VSMC-specific actin. Cells were routinely used between passages 3 and 10.

[³H]AA release. VSMC were grown in six-well culture dishes in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium-Ham's F-12 (DMEM-F12) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Subconfluent monolayers were growth arrested for 24 h in DMEM-F12 without FBS. Cells were labeled using 0.25 μCi/ml [³H]AA (100 Ci/mmol; DuPont NEN) for 24 h in serum-free medium. The cells were washed three times in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.5% bovine serum albumin (BSA) to remove unincorporated label. Cells were stimulated in serum-free medium also containing 0.5% BSA to trap released fatty acids. The cells were placed on ice, and the medium was removed and extracted using chloroform-methanol-water (2:2:1 vol/vol/vol) after exposure to various treatments. The organic phase was evaporated under a stream of N₂, reconstituted in 30 μl of chloroform-methanol (1:1 vol/vol), and spotted on Whatman LK6D silica gel thin-layer plates. The plates were developed in ethyl acetate-hexane-acetic acid-water (17:7:3:18 vol/vol/vol/vol). The fatty acids were visualized using iodine vapor, and the bands corresponding to authentic AA standard were scraped into scintillation vials and counted in 5 ml of Ecolite (ICN Biomedicals). Data are expressed as means ± SE in counts per minute per well.

Cytosolic, membrane, and nuclear fractions were analyzed for cPLA₂. Samples (5 μg protein/lane) were subjected to sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) at 30 mA, at constant current, for ~105 min using an 8.5% running gel. Proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose filters (pore size, 0.20 μm) at 100 V for 150 min using a Bio-Rad minitransblot apparatus. Nonspecific binding was blocked by incubation in PBS containing 5% (wt/vol) Carnation nonfat dry milk for 120 min at room temperature on a rotating platform. Filters were incubated with antibody (0.2 μg/ml mouse anti-human monoclonal PLA₂; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) in blocking buffer for 12 h at 4°C. The nitrocellulose filters were washed five times [10 min with Tris-buffered saline (TBS), twice for 10 min with TBS containing 0.5% Tween 20 (vol/vol), 10 min with TBS, and 5 min with TBS]. The blots were then exposed for 1 h to goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibody diluted to 0.4 μg/ml in blocking buffer. Finally, each blot was washed as described previously and exposed to chemiluminescent solution (pH 8.5; 0.1 mM Tris, 0.68 mM coumaric acid, 3% H₂O₂, and 100 mg/ml luminol) in the dark for 1 min. The blot was exposed to X-ray film (Kodak MR-1) for 15 min, the immunoreactive bands on the developed film were scanned, and the data were analyzed using the OS-Scan Lite densitometric software program (Oberlin Scientific). The optical density data for each treatment are expressed as percent of experiment-matched time 0 controls (means ± SE).

Immunoblot analysis of cPLA₂. Subconfluent monolayers of VSMC grown in 100-mm dishes were washed twice with PBS before exposure to various treatments. Cells were incubated at 37°C in Krebs-Ringer buffer [in mM: 128 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1.2 MgSO₄, 1 Na₂HPO₄, 10 glucose, 1 CaCl₂ and 20 N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES); pH 7.4] in the presence of various treatments. The treatment buffer was removed, and the cells were scraped in ice-cold PBS [containing 1 mM ethylene glycol-bis(β-aminoethyl ether)-N,N,N′,N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA)] and pelleted by centrifugation. The pellet was resuspended in PBS with protease inhibitors (50 μg/ml phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 0.1 mg/ml aprotinin, 0.1 mg/ml leupeptin, and 0.1 mg/ml ovalbumin, as well as 1 mM EGTA) and resedimented. The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was immediately frozen in liquid N₂.

The pellet was thawed and sonicated for 20 s in 100 μl of ice-cold homogenization buffer [in mM: 20 tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), 10 EDTA, 2 EGTA, and 100 glycero-phosphate] containing the protease inhibitors listed above. The cytosolic (supernatant) and membrane fractions were separated by centrifugation at 78,000 g for 25 min. The supernatant was removed and underwent an additional centrifugation (78,000 g for 25 min) to sediment any remaining particulate matter. The pellet from the first centrifugation (membrane fraction) was washed twice with ~150 μl homogenization buffer. Next, depending on the size of the pellet, 100–200 μl of membrane buffer with protease inhibitors were added to the pellet, and this fraction was solubilized by sonication. The cytosolic and membrane fractions were separated into 15-μl aliquots and stored at –70°C, and aliquots were taken for protein determination for the membrane fraction (22), whereas cytosolic protein was determined using the Pierce dye-binding assay kit. The purities of both cytosolic and particulate fractions were estimated using Western blot analysis as described below. We observed that 99% of the cytosolic marker glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase was located in the cytosolic fraction, whereas 92% of the membrane marker Ca²⁺-ATPase was identified in the particulate fraction.

The nuclear fraction was isolated according to Mizutani et al. (27). Briefly, VSMC were treated, scraped into PBS and pelleted. The supernatant was removed, and cells were exposed to cold hypotonic lysis buffer (in mM: 25 HEPES, 1

CaCl₂, and 3 MgCl₂; pH 7.4). The cells were gently homogenized using 10 up-and-down passes in a cold, tightly fitting glass homogenizer. The homogenate was centrifuged at 1,000 g for 10 min to separate the nuclei. The supernatant was centrifuged, as previously described, to isolate cytosolic and nonnuclear membrane fractions.

Immunofluorescence staining of cPLA₂. VSMC were passed into 25-mm² glass-bottom culture dishes and allowed to adhere overnight. The cells were washed twice with PBS before application of treatments. Cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 1 min, washed twice with PBS, and incubated in blocking buffer (3% BSA in PBS) at 37°C for 40 min. The cells were exposed to a polyclonal cPLA₂ antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) diluted in blocking buffer (1 μg/ml). The cells were incubated for 2 h at 37°C before four washes with blocking buffer and incubation for 45 min at 37°C with Texas red-conjugated anti-rabbit immunoglobulin G (Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories) diluted in blocking buffer (7.5 μg/ml). Finally, the cells were washed four times with blocking buffer and twice with PBS and viewed using a Nikon inverted fluorescent microscope (×100, oil immersion). Cells were observed under white light or with a Texas red filter (XF43; excitation 580 nm, emission 630 nm). Images were acquired from experiments done on 3 separate days using the same camera settings (brightness = 0, contrast = +4, gamma = 0.45, shutter speed = 1), and pictures were saved using Image-Pro software. The relative intensity of cPLA₂ immunofluorescence was estimated for 10 × 30-pixel blocks for the cytoplasm, whereas 7 × 10-pixel blocks were used for the nuclear envelope, to narrow the field of view at the surface of that organelle. The relative fluorescence intensities for cytoplasmic and nuclear sites from each cell were summed, and percent distribution at each site was determined. The data are expressed as means ± SE from six different cells for each treatment.

Statistical analyses. Statistical differences between experimental groups were determined using analysis of variance and the Newman-Keuls pairwise comparison test. Differences were considered significant at \( P < 0.05 \).

ANG II-MEDIATED TRANSLOCATION OF cPLA₂

RESULTS

**Effects of ANG II on PLA₂ activity in VSMC.** The effects of ANG II on PLA₂ activities in VSMC were determined by measuring the release of [³H]AA from prelabeled cells. Exposure of the ³H-labeled cells to 100 nM ANG II stimulated the time-dependent release of [³H]AA, which was marked by 30 s and peaked at 10 min as a 218% increase in unesterified AA compared with untreated cells (Fig. 1). The rate of [³H]AA release in ANG II-treated cells was reduced to control levels by 20 or 30 min of exposure. This decline in the rate of AA release is shown in Fig. 1, inset, in which accumulated [³H]AA is reported as the difference between treated and untreated cells.

Partial characterization of the ANG II-evoked accumulation of unesterified AA is shown in Fig. 2. The nonselective receptor antagonist [Sar¹,Thr⁸]ANG II blocked 98% of the [³H]AA accumulation induced by exposure to 100 nM ANG II. Examination of receptor subtypes showed that the AT₁ receptor antagonist EXP-3174 (1 μM) also eliminated ANG II-evoked AA release, whereas another AT₁ receptor antagonist, losartan (1 μM), reduced AA accumulation by 74%. In contrast, the AT₂ receptor antagonist PD-123319 (1 μM) attenuated ANG II-induced AA release by only 16%. Furthermore, removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ with EGTA reduced the effects of ANG II by 66%, whereas the PLC inhibitor U-73122 (10 μM) attenuated the receptor-dependent accumulation of [³H]AA by 52%. Consistent with a role for Ca²⁺ in the activation of PLA₂, the Ca²⁺ ionophore ionomycin (10 μM) stimulated a 47% increase in AA accumulation in the absence of the agonist. Finally, the nonspecific PLA₂ inhibitor 4-bromophenacyl bromide (0.1 μM) reduced ANG II-dependent [³H]AA accumulation by 87%, and the cPLA₂ inhibitor AACOCF₃ (0.1 μM) blocked 97% of the agonist-induced AA release. In contrast, haloenol lactone suicide substrate (HELSS; 5 μM), which is an inhibitor of Ca²⁺-independent PLA₂, reduced ANG II-evoked AA release by only 25%.

ANG II-induced translocation of cPLA₂. Membrane and cytosolic fractions were prepared from control and ANG II-treated VSMC, to examine cPLA₂ translocation. Proteins from both fractions were separated by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-cPLA₂. In both fractions, the monoclonal antibody against the lipase detected a protein with an apparent molecular mass of 160 kDa. That this band was authentic cPLA₂ was verified using other cell types, in which both the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies detected a single band at 85 kDa in CHO or at ~120 kDa in rat liver, brain, or kidney cells. In VSMC, the relative distributions of cPLA₂ between the two fractions in untreated cells were 80% cytosolic to 20% particulate, when equal amounts of protein were separated from each fraction. The immunoblot data for the membrane fraction are shown in Fig. 3. Exposure of the cells to 1 μM ANG II stimulated a time-dependent increase of cPLA₂ in the particulate fraction, since at 2.5 or 7 min the membrane-associated cPLA₂ increased to 117 or 125% of the time 0 control value, respectively. However, this protein declined to 77% of control at 15 min of treatment. The receptor dependence of the ANG II-induced translocation is also shown in Fig. 3. The cPLA₂ content in the membrane fraction was reduced to 93% of the control value when the cells were incubated with the AT₁ antagonist losartan for 2 min before exposure to ANG II for 7 min.

The effects of ANG II on the translocation of cPLA₂ to the nucleus are shown in Fig. 4. Due to the enrichment of the lipase in this fraction compared with the total membrane fraction, cPLA₂ was detected as a doublet on immunoblot analysis of the nuclear fraction. A 7-min exposure to ANG II increased the amount of cPLA₂ in the nuclear fraction to 136% of control. Concomitantly, the amount of cPLA₂ in the cytoplasmic fraction was

**Fig. 3. ANG II-dependent translocation of cytosolic phospholipase A₂ (cPLA₂) to a membrane fraction. VSMC were treated with ANG II (1 μM) in absence or presence of losartan (10 μM) for times indicated. cPLA₂ in membrane-particulate fraction was detected by immunoblotting with a monoclonal antibody as described in METHODS. A: typical blot is shown, with positions of molecular mass markers (kDa) indicated at left. A 7-min exposure to ANG II in presence of losartan (7L) is also shown. B: averaged densitometric readings from at least 4 membrane fractions are shown as percent of time 0 controls (means ± SE) taken from matching preparations and blots. Again, effects of losartan on distribution of cPLA₂ to membrane fraction in VSMC exposed to ANG II for 7 min are shown (7L). *Significantly different from 7-min ANG II.*

**Immunofluorescence detection of cPLA₂ in intact VSMC.** Immunofluorescence was used to localize cPLA₂ in intact VSMC. In nonstimulated cells, the fluorescence appeared as a diffuse signal throughout the cell. However, treatment with ANG II caused the movement of the cPLA₂ from the cytoplasm to the nuclear membrane, where antibody staining revealed a bright halo around the nucleus. Through pixel analysis, increases in fluorescence intensity were detected at the surface of the nuclei, which corresponded to a 24% increase over control by 7 min of exposure. This ANG II-induced fluorescent labeling of the nuclei returned to near baseline at 15 min of stimulation. These data and the effects of removing extracellular Ca²⁺ are expressed as percent of total immunofluorescence, to show the reduced by 89% under the same conditions. In the presence of losartan, ANG II increased the amount of cPLA₂ in the nuclear fraction by only 10%, and the amount remaining in the cytosol was found to be 33% of the untreated time 0 control. Ionomycin mimicked these effects of ANG II, since it increased the cPLA₂ in the nucleus by 31% while reducing that in the cytoplasm by 57%.

**Fig. 4. ANG II-dependent translocation of cPLA₂ to nuclear fraction. VSMC were treated with 1.0 μM ionomycin or with 1 μM ANG II in absence or presence of 10 μM losartan for 7 min. Nuclear fraction (nucleus) was separated from cytosol, and immunoblotting was used to identify cPLA₂ as described. Top: typical blot is shown, with control (Cntl) and experimental blots from both cytosol and nuclear fractions. Bottom: densitometric quantitations of at least 4 blots from cytosol (A) and nucleus (B) are shown as percent of control (means ± SE). *Significantly different from 7-min ANG II value.*

changes in the relative distribution of the cPLA₂ between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Fig. 5). The baseline distributions of cPLA₂ in cells maintained in the presence of 1 mM Ca²⁺ were 60% associated with the nucleus and 40% in the cytosol. ANG II increased the distributions of cPLA₂ at the nucleus to 67 or 72% at 2.5 or 7 min of treatment, respectively. In contrast, the cPLA₂ associated with the nucleus declined to 58% by 15 min of exposure to the peptide. The amount of cPLA₂ in the cytoplasm reflected this translocation, since the

VSMC were treated with 1 μM ANG II in absence (○) or presence (●) of extracellular Ca²⁺ for times indicated. Quantitative analysis of immunofluorescence was performed as described in METHODS; 6 fluorescence readings from nucleus (A) and cytosol (B) were taken under each condition and averaged. Results for each fraction are presented as percent of total cellular fluorescence (means ± SE) for at least 4 cells. *Significantly different from fraction- and time-matched values in presence of extracellular Ca²⁺.**

distributions were reduced to 33 or 28% at 2.5 or 7 min of treatment, respectively. This value increased to 42% when the cells were incubated with ANG II for 15 min in the presence of Ca²⁺.

The effects of removing extracellular Ca²⁺ on PLA₂ translocation are also shown in Fig. 5. The baseline values for cells incubated in Ca²⁺-free Krebs-Ringer buffer showed nearly even distributions of PLA₂, since 48% of the immunofluorescence was associated with the nucleus and 52% remained cytosolic. These values represented a significant decline in cPLA₂ associated with the nuclei of unstimulated cells incubated in the absence of Ca²⁺. Treatment with ANG II for 2.5 or 7 min increased nuclear cPLA₂ to 53 or 61% of the total, respectively. Nuclear cPLA₂ content was reduced to 58% by 15 min of treatment. The ANG II-induced alterations in cPLA₂ in the cytosol were also affected in Ca²⁺-free media, since the distributions were 47, 39, or 42% at 2.5, 7, or 15 min of exposure, respectively.

Further characterizations of the immunofluorescence-dependent detection of cPLA₂ translocation are given in Fig. 6. Again, exposure of the VSMC to ANG II for 7 min caused a shift in relative fluorescence, since that associated with the nucleus increased from 60% at time 0 to 72%, while that detected in the cytoplasm decreased from 40 to 28%. The distributions to the nucleus in the presence of ANG II for 7 min were 53, 55, and 66% in the presence of [Sar¹, Thr⁸]ANG II, losartan, or PD-123319, respectively. Also, the cytoplasmic contents of cPLA₂ were 47, 45, and 34% in the presence of [Sar¹, Thr⁸]ANG II, losartan, or PD-123319, respectively. The Ca²⁺ ionophore also induced detectable translocation, since the distribution of the fluorescence associated with the nucleus increased to 82% of the total in the presence of ionomycin, while that in the cytoplasm decreased to 18%.

**DISCUSSION**

AA acts as a second messenger and is released from membrane phospholipids in response to the activation of receptors by a variety of agonists. Such receptor-coupled accumulation of unesterified AA may involve the activation of cPLA₂. This enzyme requires micromolar concentrations of Ca²⁺, has a high molecular mass, translocates from the cytosol to a membrane target on exposure to Ca²⁺, and specifically removes AA from its substrates (6, 7). The activation and/or translocation of this cPLA₂ is stimulated by numerous agonists, including ATP in CHO cells (9), phenylephrine in VSMC (29), and ANG II in vascular endothelial cells (30). However, the translocation and/or activation of cPLA₂ has not been demonstrated in VSMC exposed to ANG II. Here, we show that the peptide hormone acts through the AT₁ receptor to induce the Ca²⁺-dependent accumulation of AA and the movement of cPLA₂ from the cytosol to the nuclear membrane.

ANG II stimulates the proliferation of VSMC, and this effect is mediated through the AT₁ receptor (12). AA may be involved in this response, since it regulates DNA synthesis and gene transcription in other cell types (18, 20, 24). Consistent with this suggestion, the ANG II-induced accumulation of [³H]AA was attenuated by the AT₁ receptor antagonist. However, the AT₂ antagonist PD-123319 also mediated a minor reduction in AA release. In contrast, the translocation of cPLA₂ to a membrane target appeared to be coupled exclusively to an AT₁ receptor, since the ANG II-dependent translocation of cPLA₂ to the nucleus was blocked by losartan. This effect was shown using both immunoblot analysis of separated proteins and immunofluorescence in intact cells. In addition, AACOCF₃, which is an inhibitor of cPLA₂, eliminated the ANG II-dependent [³H]AA release. Thus ANG II induced the activation and translocation of cPLA₂ via the AT₁ receptor subtype.

ANG II induces an increase in Ca²⁺ in VSMC through a combination of influx and mobilization from intracellular stores (13), and this response may be involved in the regulation of cPLA₂. The ANG II-induced accumulation of [³H]AA was reduced by two-thirds when EGTA was used to remove extracellular Ca²⁺. In addition, attenuation of ANG II-dependent Ca²⁺ mobilization via inhibition of PLC with U-73122 (13) resulted in a 52% reduction in AA accumulation, whereas ionomycin-induced Ca²⁺ influx stimulated a 47% increase in unesterified [³H]AA. This apparent dependence of ANG II-induced cPLA₂ activation on both the influx and mobilization of Ca²⁺ was consistent with observations for ANG II stimulation of phospholipase D in VSMC (13). However, the persistent release of AA in the presence of treatments that attenuate the accumulation of Ca²⁺ raises the possibility that some fraction of the ANG II-mediated AA release involved a Ca²⁺-independent PLA₂. Consistent with this suggestion, inhibition of Ca²⁺-independent PLA₂ with HELSS reduced ANG II-mediated AA release by 25%.

The translocation of cPLA₂ from cytosol to the nucleus was also affected by available Ca²⁺, since ionomycin

Intact VSMC were treated with control buffer, ionomycin (1 μM), or 1 μM ANG II in absence or presence of [Sar¹, Thr⁸]ANG II (10 μM), losartan (10 μM), or PD-123319 (10 μM). Immunofluorescence readings of nucleus (A) and cytosol (B) were averaged from 6 readings from at least 4 cells. Cytosol and nucleus values were summed for each condition, and data are presented as percent total fluorescence (means ± SE). *Significantly different from matched controls.
induced this movement, whereas removal of extracellular Ca²⁺ reduced the ANG II-dependent movement of cPLA₂ to the nucleus by about one-half. Furthermore, incubation of unstimulated, intact cells in the absence of Ca²⁺ for 2 min was sufficient to reduce the amount of cPLA₂ associated with the nucleus (Fig. 5). It appeared, therefore, that resting levels of intracellular Ca²⁺ are sufficient to maintain a constitutive localization of cPLA₂ at the nucleus and that the ANG II-dependent increase in available Ca²⁺ is needed for the activation and translocation of the enzyme.

The time courses for ANG II-induced activation and translocation of cPLA₂ were similar. Both showed rapid initiations following exposure of the VSMC to the agonist, and both appeared to be downregulated within 15–20 min of stimulation. Immunoblot analysis of cPLA₂ associated with the nuclear fraction showed the translocation of a protein doublet with apparent molecular masses near 160 kDa. This value is likely to be higher than the actual mass, since cPLA₂ generally migrates slowly when separated by SDS-PAGE (6, 7). That the translocated lipase separates as a doublet is consistent with the suggestion that kinase-dependent phosphorylation is required for full activation of the enzyme (35). Although this has not yet been shown in ANG II-stimulated VSMC, it may explain the observation that ANG II was a more potent effector of [³H]AA release than was ionomycin, since ANG II stimulates the phosphorylation of cPLA₂ (32) and Ca²⁺ accumulation (13), whereas ionomycin directly affects the availability of Ca²⁺.

In sum, a cPLA₂ was identified in VSMC. It had a high molecular mass and separated on gels as a protein doublet, which may represent its phosphorylation state. This protein doublet rapidly migrated from the cytosolic compartment to the nucleus on exposure of the cells to ANG II. The time course for this movement was chronologically consistent with the activation of the enzyme and the consequent release of [³H]AA from prelabeled glycerolipids, which was eliminated by the cPLA₂ inhibitor AACOCF₃. Both the stimulation of the lipase and its translocation to the nuclear target required activation of the AT₁ receptor subtype, and both depended on available Ca²⁺. It is possible that this AT₁-coupled, Ca²⁺-dependent production of unesterified AA plays a central role in the proliferation of VSMC induced by ANG II. However, further work is needed to localize the production of unesterified AA to specific subcellular compartments and to show the coupling of this second messenger with VSMC growth.
