### Abstract  
Investigation into arthritis as well as the numerous bone phenotypes found in mice lacking immune-related genes has highlighted the importance of the dynamic interplay between the bone and immune systems. It has recently led to both the emergence and subsequent rapid evolution of the field of osteoimmunology. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) stimulates osteoclastogenesis through the nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), which is well known as a crucial regulator of immunity. Studies on RANKL signaling revealed various immune-related genes which are involved in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the enhanced activity of osteoclasts resulting from the activation of T cells. Here we describe our efforts to address the challenging question as to how abnormal T-cell activation mechanistically induces bone destruction. The scope of osteoimmunology has been extended to encompass a wide range of molecular and cellular interactions, the elucidation of which will provide a scientific basis for future therapeutic approaches to diseases related to both the bone and immune systems.

### Introduction  
The bony skeleton enables locomotive activity, the storage of calcium, and the harboring of the hematopoietic stem cells from which blood and immune cells are derived. Although bone appears to be metabolically inert, it is actually a dynamic organ under the active control of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Excessive activity of osteoclasts leads to pathological bone resorption, as seen in a variety of local or generalized osteopenic conditions. Therefore, elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms involved in osteoclastogenesis is critical for understanding the skeletal system in health and disease [1–3].

Traditionally, the endocrine system has been understood to be in the mainstream of the regulatory systems of osteoclast lineage; however, accumulating evidence has suggested osteoclasts and immune cells share a number of regulatory molecules, including cytokines, receptors, signaling molecules and transcription factors, which mutually influence each other. Furthermore, immune cells are derived from bone marrow, and thus develop in the same microenvironment as osteoclasts [1, 4]. In fact, patients with excessive activation of the immune system, as in the case of arthritis, are also at higher risk of experiencing concomitant osteoporosis as well as localized bone destruction. In addition, mice deficient in immunomodulatory molecules have been found to frequently develop an abnormal osteoclast phenotype [1], and have afforded profound insight into osteoclast biology (Fig. 1). Here, we summarize recent progress in the understanding of osteoclast development in the context of the newly

Fig. 1 Molecules essential for osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclastogenesis is dependent on two major cytokines, M-CSF and RANKL. Hematopoietic stem cells undergo differentiation into macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-M), which are the common precursor cells of macrophages and osteoclasts. The differentiation step from CFU-M to multinucleated osteoclasts is characterized by cell-cell fusion, which is mainly induced by RANKL. Mature osteoclasts acquire bone resorbing activity, which is also dependent on M-CSF and RANKL. Molecules are depicted at the stage in which they are predominantly involved.

The essential role of RANKL in bone metabolism

Evidence for a relationship between the immune and skeletal systems has long been recognized. More than three decades ago, antigen-stimulated immune cells were shown to produce soluble factors that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption [5]. In the 1980s, interleukin (IL)-1 was identified to be one of these factors [6]. In the late 1980s, an in vitro coculture system for osteoclast formation was established. This system revealed the importance of the cell-to-cell contact of osteoblasts/stromal cells and hematopoietic cells for osteoclast differentiation [7, 8]. Based on this insight, it was proposed that osteoclastogenesis-supporting mesenchymal cells express osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF) as a membrane-associated protein [9].

In 1997, the potential inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis osteoprotegerin (OPG) was cloned [10, 11]. In 1998, OPG was found to associate with a transmembrane protein of the TNF superfamily and to function as a decoy receptor [12, 13]. Interestingly, immunologists cloned the same molecule as a stimulator of dendritic cells expressed by T cells, and called it receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) or TNF-related activation-induced cytokine (TRANCE) [14, 15]. This transmembrane protein RANKL is, in fact, the long-sought ODF. The receptor for RANKL is RANK, a type I transmembrane protein, which, similar
to other members of the TNF receptor family, assembles into a functional trimer [14, 16]. Mice with a disruption of Rank or Rankl exhibit severe osteopetrosis, accompanied by a defect in tooth eruption caused by a complete lack of osteoclasts. These genetic findings clearly demonstrated that RANK and RANKL are essential for osteoclastogenesis in vivo [17, 18]. In contrast, mice lacking OPG exhibit severe osteoporosis, resulting from both an increased number and enhanced activity of osteoclasts [19, 20]. In humans, mutations in RANK, RANKL and OPG have been identified in patients with bone disorders such as familial expansile osteolysis, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis and juvenile Paget’s disease of bone, respectively [21–24].

RANKL functions as a membrane-anchored molecule, and is released from the cell surface as a soluble molecule following proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-14 [25, 26]. Both soluble and membrane-bound RANKL function as agonistic ligands for RANK. However, we and other researchers have suggested that membrane-bound RANKL is more efficient than soluble RANKL [25, 27, 28]. In addition, previous studies have indicated that RANKL serves as both a chemotactic and survival factor for osteoclasts [29, 30]. RANKL is mainly expressed in mesenchymal cells such as osteoblast/ stromal and synovial cells. RANKL expression can be upregulated by osteoclastogenic factors such as vitamin D₃, prostaglandin E₂, parathyroid hormone, IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17 and TNF-α [2, 25].

### Immunological function of RANKL

Intriguingly, in addition to a defect in osteoclasts, RANKL-deficient mice have a defect in the development and organization of secondary lymphoid tissue [17]. Severe immunodeficiency is not observed in RANKL-deficient mice, nor have obvious adverse effects in the immune system been reported to result from the administration of anti-RANKL antibody in humans [31]. The loss of RANKL in T cells seems to be compensated by CD40L in mice [32]. These observations initially suggested that the immunological function of RANKL is of lesser importance, but recent studies have revealed a crucial role for RANKL in the immune system. RANKL has been shown to play a role in a pathological model of inflammatory bowel disease by stimulating dendritic cells [33, 34], suggesting that RANKL is distinctly involved in the activation of dendritic cells under certain autoimmune conditions. On the other hand, keratinocytes express RANKL in response to ultraviolet stimulation of the skin, which may activate Langerhans cells and trigger the expansion of regulatory T cells in draining lymph nodes [35]. This suggests an unexpected role for RANKL in immunosuppression. In addition, recent studies have shown that cooperation between RANK and CD40 promotes medullary thymic epithelial cell development, thereby establishing self-tolerance [36, 37]. Although the functions of RANKL in the immune system need to be elucidated in greater detail, the discovery and subsequent functional analysis of RANKL have become the driving force for the understanding of the osteoimmune axis.

#### Intracellular signal transduction of RANKL

RANK is a transmembrane molecule expressed on osteoclast precursor cells and mature osteoclasts. Ligation of RANK with RANKL results in the commitment of monocyte/macrophage precursor cells to the osteoclast lineage and the activation of mature osteoclasts. RANK lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity in its intracellular domain, and transduces signals by recruiting adaptor molecules such as the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins [1]. Genetic approaches followed by intensive molecular analyses have identified TRAF6 as the main adaptor molecule that links RANK to the differentiation and function of osteoclasts [38–40]. By an as yet unknown mechanism, RANKL binding to RANK induces trimerization of RANK and TRAF6, which leads to the activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), including Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 [41]. The spatiotemporal control of the RANK signaling cascades during osteoclastogenesis is summarized in Fig. 2.

The essential role of NF-κB in osteoclastogenesis has been demonstrated genetically [42, 43]. NF-κB p50 and p52 double-deficient mice develop severe osteopetrosis because of a defect in osteoclastogenesis. The upstream kinase complex that mediates inhibitor of NF-κB (IκB) phosphorylation and degradation, comprising the catalytic subunits IκB kinase α (IKKα), IKKβ and the non-catalytic subunit IKKγ (also known as NEMO), are also important for RANK signaling and osteoclastogenesis. In mice, IKKβ is required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis both in vitro and in vivo, whereas IKKα appears to be required only in vitro, not in vivo [41]. Importantly, patients with X-linked osteopetrosis, lymphedema, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency (OL-EDA-ID syndrome) carry a X420W point mutation in IKKγ [44]. It remains to be determined how RANK alone, among the TRAF6-binding receptors, is able to stimulate osteoclastogenesis so potently. Additional RANK-specific adaptor molecules might exist and enhance TRAF6 signaling [45]. For example, the molecular scaffold Grb2-associated binding protein 2 (Gab2) and/or four-and-a-half LIM domain 2 (FHL2) have been shown to be associated with RANK and
Fig. 2 Signaling cascades during osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclastogenesis is cooperatively induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) and its costimulatory factor, immunoglobulin-like receptor (IgLR). **a** Precursor-cell stage. The binding of M-CSF to its receptor, c-Fms, activates the proliferation and survival of osteoclast precursor cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and induces RANK expression. The costimulatory receptors might be stimulated at early stages, although the ligands of the costimulatory receptors have yet to be identified. **b** Proximal RANK signals. RANKL binding to RANK results in the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and, at the same time, the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and Fc receptor common γ subunit (FcRγ), both of which are adaptor proteins associating with distinct IgLRs. **c** Initial induction of NFATc1 (nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1). NFATc1, a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, is initially induced by the TRAF6-activated

NF-κB and NFATc2 that are present in the cell before RANKL stimulation. RANK and ITAM signals cooperate to phosphorylate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and activate calcium signaling, which is critical for the activation of NFATc1. The tyrosine kinases Btk and Tec are activated by RANK and are important for the phosphorylation of PLCγ, thus linking the two pathways. **d** Autoamplification of NFATc1. Calcium signal-mediated persistent activation of NFATc1, as well as cooperation with activator protein 1 (AP-1), is a prerequisite for the robust induction of NFATc1. AP-1 activation is mediated by the induction and activation of c-Fos by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV)-stimulated cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Fms. The NFATc1 promoter is epigenetically activated through histone acetylation and NFATc1 binds to an NFAT-binding site on its own promoter. **e** In the nucleus, NFATc1 works together with other transcription factors, such as AP-1, PU.1, CREB and microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) to induce various osteoclast-specific genes

to have an important role in its signal transduction [46, 47]. On the other hand, recent investigation has revealed the deubiquitinating enzyme CYLD negatively regulates RANK signaling by inhibiting TRAF6 ubiquitination and activation of downstream signaling events [48].

The activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcription factor complex is also essential for osteoclastogenesis [49]. RANK activates AP-1 through induction of the component c-Fos. We showed Fos induction is dependent on the activation of calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase

peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\gamma$ coactivator 1$\beta$ (PGC-1$\beta$) is induced during osteoclast differentiation by CREB by reactive oxygen species, and that orchestrated mitochondrial biogenesis is a fundamental pathway linked to osteoclastogenesis [54].

### Osteoclastogenic transcription factor NFATc1

Importantly, RANKL specifically and strongly induces nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), the master regulator of osteoclast differentiation, and this induction is dependent on both the TRAF6-NF-$\kappa$B and c-Fos pathways [55]. The NFAT family of transcription factors was originally discovered in T cells, but they are involved in the regulation of various biological systems [56, 57]. Activation of NFAT is mediated by a specific phosphatase, calcineurin, which is activated by calcium-calmodulin signaling. The essential and sufficient role of the *Nfatcl* gene in osteoclastogenesis has been shown both in vitro and in vivo [55, 58, 59]. The *Nfatcl* promoter contains NFAT binding sites and NFATc1 specifically autoregulates its own promoter during osteoclastogenesis, thus enabling the robust induction of NFATc1 [58]. AP-1 containing c-Fos, together with continuous activation of calcium signaling, is crucial for this autoamplification [55, 60]. NFATc1 regulates a number of osteoclast-specific genes in cooperation with other transcription factors such as AP-1, PU.1 and MITF [1]. A recent study indicated that CREB, activated by CaMKIV, also cooperates with NFATc1 in the activation of osteoclast-specific genes (Fig. 2). However, compared with the wealth of information on RANK signaling in osteoclasts, it is less well understood whether RANK uses the same signaling mechanisms in the immune system. Although regulation of NFATc1 by calcium-calcineurin is well documented, it is interesting to note that NFATc1 is also regulated by other factors, such as pH [61].

#### Calcium signaling and immunoreceptors in osteoclastogenesis

Phospholipase C$\gamma$ (PLC$\gamma$), which mediates $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from intracellular stores, is crucial for the activation of the key transcription factor NFATc1 via calcineurin [55]. However, despite the evident importance of the calcium-NFAT pathway, it has remained unclear how RANKL activates calcium signals. RANK belongs to the TNF receptor family which has yet to be directly connected to calcium signaling. The activation of PLC$\gamma$ by RANK requires the protein tyrosine kinase Syk, along with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing molecules, such as DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and the Fc receptor common gamma chain (FcR$\gamma$) [62]. In the osteoclast lineage, immunoglobulin-like receptors associated with DAP12 include triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) and signal-regulatory protein $\beta$1 (SIRP$\beta$1); those associated with FcR$\gamma$ include osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor A (PIR-A). As ITAM signals are essential for osteoclastogenesis, but by themselves cannot induce osteoclastogenesis, these signals should properly be considered costimulatory signals for RANK. The binding of M-CSF to its receptor c-Fms also generates a signaling complex comprising phosphorylated DAP12 and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk [63]. Thus, RANKL and M-CSF signals may converge on the ITAM signaling pathway.

It is also conceivable that RANK activates an as yet unknown pathway that specifically synergizes with or upregulates ITAM signaling. Recent studies have shown that RGS10 is activated by RANK and mediates calcium oscillation [64]. Furthermore, we have shown that Tec family tyrosine kinases such as Btk and Tec are activated by RANK and are involved in the phosphorylation of PLC$\gamma$ [65]. An osteopetrotic phenotype in Tec and Btk double-deficient mice revealed that these two kinases play an essential role in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Tec and Btk had been known to play a key role in proximal BCR signaling, but this study established their crucial role in linking the RANK and ITAM signals. This study also identified an osteoclastogenic signaling complex, composed of Tec kinases and scaffold proteins, which charts a new paradigm for the signal transduction mechanism of osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 2).

Based on the phenotype exhibited by knockout mice, PLC$\gamma$2 was shown to be required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis by regulating calcium signaling. PLC$\gamma$2 forms a complex with Gab2 and modulates Gab2 recruitment to RANK in osteoclasts [66], suggesting an additional role for PLC$\gamma$ in RANK signaling. In addition, recent investigation has revealed mice deficient in TRPV4, a $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable channel of the transient receptor potential family, have increased bone mass caused by impaired bone resorption. These results suggest that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ oscillations and TRPV4-mediated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx are sequentially required to sustain NFATc1-dependent gene expression throughout osteoclastogenesis [67].

#### The crucial role of osteoclasts in bone destruction in arthritis

Activation of the immune system is essential for host defense against pathogens, but aberrant and/or prolonged
activation under pathological conditions results in tissue damage owing to the activation of effector cells. In rheumatoid arthritis (RA), a long standing question is how abnormal T-cell activation (characterized by the infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells) mechanistically induces bone damage [1]. In the early 1980s, researchers observed osteoclast-like cells at the bone destruction site [68], but it was not until RANKL was cloned that the importance of osteoclasts became generally accepted. We demonstrated efficient osteoclastogenesis in primary synovial cell cultures obtained from RA patients [69]. Moreover, high RANKL expression has been detected, specifically in the synovium of RA patients [70]. Additionally, osteoclast-deficient mice are protected from bone erosion in arthritis models [71, 72]. In the absence of osteoclasts, bone destruction did not occur despite a similar level of inflammation, indicating that RANKL and osteoclasts are indispensable for the bone loss associated with inflammation. Blocking RANKL through OPG treatment significantly prevented bone destruction in adjuvant arthritis [73]. Consistent with this, anti-RANKL and anti-osteoclast therapies have been shown to be beneficial in the treatment of RA in human trials [73–75].

### Regulation of osteoclastogenesis by T cells

As RANKL is expressed in activated T cells, T cells might have the capacity to induce osteoclast differentiation by directly acting on osteoclast precursor cells under pathological conditions [73, 76]. However, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which is produced by T cells, potently suppresses RANKL signaling through a rapid degradation of TRAF6 [77]. To fully understand the effects of T cells on osteoclastogenesis, it is absolutely necessary to elucidate the effects of the various cytokines which T cells produce. The effects of T cells on osteoclastogenesis would be expected to be dependent on the balance between positive and negative factors expressed by the T cells. As the CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (T<sub>H</sub>)-cell subsets T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 produce IFN-γ and IL-4, respectively, both of which are anti-osteoclastogenic, it has been a paradox how the activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in arthritis enhances osteoclastogenesis in the presence of these cytokines. In this context, it is worthwhile to characterize what we believe to be a very rare but pathologically important T-cell subset responsible for abnormal bone resorption, osteoclastogenic T<sub>H</sub> cells (T<sub>H</sub>Oc cells) [1]. Previous investigations from our laboratory and others on synovial T cells in rheumatoid arthritis have determined the characteristics of T<sub>H</sub>Oc cells. First, T<sub>H</sub>Oc cells do not produce a large amount of IFN-γ. Second, they trigger local inflammation and the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, which induce RANKL expression on synovial fibroblasts. Third, T<sub>H</sub>Oc cells express RANKL and might directly participate in accelerated osteoclastogenesis. Based on these osteoclastogenic characteristics, these cells can tip the balance in favor of osteoclastogenesis in various respects. Although autoimmune arthritis has been traditionally classified as a T<sub>H</sub>1-type disease, T<sub>H</sub>1 cells do not have the requisite characteristics to fulfill this role, indicating that the T<sub>H</sub>Oc cells might belong to an as yet unknown subset.

T<sub>H</sub>17 cells exclusively function as an osteoclastogenic T cell subset

Recent data from our laboratory indicate that an IL-17 producing T<sub>H</sub>-cell subset (T<sub>H</sub>17 cells) represents the long-sought-after T<sub>H</sub>Oc cell subset among the known CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lineages, whereas T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells have anti-osteoclastogenic effects [78]. It has already been reported that IL-17 expression is increased in RA joints [79]. IL-17 is well known to induce local inflammation in autoimmune diseases through inflammatory cytokine production [80–82]. Moreover, IL-17 induces RANKL on mesenchymal cells [79]. We have also shown that T<sub>H</sub>17 cells express higher levels of RANKL than T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 cells [78]. Therefore, the infiltration of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells into the inflammatory lesion links the abnormal T-cell response to bone damage in arthritis, and the pathogenesis of RA should be reconsidered in the context of a T<sub>H</sub>17-type disease (Fig. 3). Clearly, this subset is an auspicious target for future therapeutic investigation, and cytokines related to T<sub>H</sub>17-cell differentiation and expansion, such as IL-6, TGF-β and IL-23, are of potentially great clinical importance [83, 84].

### Clinical implications

A detailed osteoimmunological understanding of the pathogenesis of bone destruction will give rise to novel strategies for the treatment of various diseases, including, but not limited to, RA, periodontal disease, Paget’s disease, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, multiple myeloma, and metastatic bone tumors [1, 2, 4]. The action of TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines is not limited to the induction of local inflammation, but is both directly and indirectly involved in the activation of osteoclasts [85]. A recent report showed that TNF-α induces Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, and that neutralization of DKK-1 leads to an increase in bone formation as well as a decrease in bone resorption [86]. Such osteoimmunological pleiotropy might explain the dramatic efficacy of biological agents that inhibit cytokines so as to ameliorate or even prevent bone destruction. In addition, the efficacy of a

Fig. 3 Mechanisms of bone destruction in arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory synovium invades and destroys bone, which is mediated by osteoclasts. Cells in the synovium include synovial macrophages and fibroblasts in addition to infiltrating CD4⁺ T cells. Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-secreting T helper cells (T_H17 cells) are the only osteoclastogenic T_H-cell subset (T_HOc cells) characterized thus far. T_H17 cells do not produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which suppresses RANKL signaling, but do secrete relatively large amounts of IL-17, which induces RANKL on synovial fibroblasts. IL-17 also stimulates local inflammation and activates synovial macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-6. These cytokines activate osteoclastogenesis by either directly acting on osteoclast precursor cells or by inducing RANKL on synovial fibroblasts. T_H17 cells also express RANKL on the cell membrane, which partly contributes to the enhanced osteoclastogenesis (the dotted line)

RANKL-specific antibody for postmenopausal osteoporosis and RA in clinical trials has been reported [31, 87], and its apparent preventative effect on bone metastasis is enormously promising [29, 88]. Interestingly, another recent study has provided evidence that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) induces chemotaxis and regulates the migration of osteoclast precursors, and treatment with the S1P receptor agonist (FTY720; Fingolimod) ameliorated bone loss in postmenopausal osteoporosis by reducing the number of mature osteoclasts attached to the bone surface [89]. It is still unclear why FTY720 treatment inhibits the egress of lymphocytes into the peripheral blood (as a functional antagonist), but increases that of osteoclast precursors (as a functional agonist). The clinical relevance of newly recognized cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-23 is being tested in human trials, and IL-6 inhibition, for which a drug has been approved for the treatment of structural joint damage in rheumatoid arthritis in Japan in advance of the anticipated worldwide approval, might have a dual impact on T_H17-mediated immune and bone responses [90]. Although it is difficult to specifically target transcription factors and signaling molecules in drug treatment, NF-κB inhibitors are also under development [91]. Based on recent findings, NFATc1 is another important research target for future therapy against excessive osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, some currently prescribed anti-rheumatic drugs have been shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the induction of NFATc1 [92, 93]. Therefore, the osteoimmunological perspective, together with the spate of emerging findings, has enabled the acquisition of profound insights into the mode of action of therapeutic drugs as well as novel strategies for drug design.

Conclusion

The bone and immune systems share an abundance of molecules and regulatory mechanisms. Despite recent

advances in the field of osteoimmunology, a number of significant questions persist. It remains unclear, for example, how distinct functions are achieved through similar mechanisms. It should also be investigated how the immune response is regulated by bone cells. In fact, the bone and immune systems are so closely intermingled that all factors which regulate immune cells should be investigated for their effect on bone, and vice versa. Such a complementary approach will be greatly facilitated by the increasing availability of genetically modified mice, and will lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular basis for cell lineage specification. Most importantly, cell type-specific treatments, despite the similarity and indeed, overlap of the two systems, may thus become a realistic therapeutic option. The novel functions of bone cells in the regulation of cells outside the bone will therefore have an impact on many areas of biomedical investigation. For example, the crucial function of bone cells in the control of haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) might provide new methods to modulate HSC mobilization [94]. In the end, both clinical and non-clinical researchers are expected to derive benefit from the emerging insights obtained in osteoimmunology.
