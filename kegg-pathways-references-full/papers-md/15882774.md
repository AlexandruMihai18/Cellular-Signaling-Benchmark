### Abstract

Dendritic spines are small protrusions that cover the surface of dendrites and bear the postsynaptic component of excitatory synapses. Having an enlarged head connected to the dendrite by a narrow neck, dendritic spines provide a postsynaptic biochemical compartment that separates the synaptic space from the dendritic shaft and allows each spine to function as a partially independent unit. Spines develop around the time of synaptogenesis and are dynamic structures that continue to undergo remodeling over time. Changes in spine morphology and density influence the properties of neural circuits. Our knowledge of the structure and function of dendritic spines has progressed significantly since their discovery over a century ago, but many uncertainties still remain. For example, several different models have been put forth outlining the sequence of events that lead to the genesis of a spine. Although spines are small and apparently simple organelles with a cytoskeleton mainly composed of actin filaments, regulation of their morphology and physiology appears to be quite sophisticated. A multitude of molecules have been implicated in dendritic spine development and remodeling, suggesting that intricate networks of interconnected signaling pathways converge to regulate actin dynamics in spines. This complexity is not surprising, given the likely importance of dendritic spines in higher brain functions. In this review, we discuss the molecules that are currently known to mediate the exquisite sensitivity of spines to perturbations in their environment and we outline how these molecules interface with each other to mediate cascades of signals flowing from the spine surface to the actin cytoskeleton.

(Fig. 1). Furthermore, dendritic spines are dynamic structures that can probably “twitch” (Crick, 1982) and change shape—sometimes rapidly—during their lifetime.

The spine head contains the postsynaptic density, an electron-dense structure juxtaposed to the active zone of the presynaptic terminal, which is the presynaptic region where neurotransmitters are released into the synaptic cleft (Li and Sheng, 2003; Scannevin and Huganir, 2000). The postsynaptic density can be continuous or perforated and can have variable sizes that correlate with the size of the spine head (Geinisman, 1993; Harris et al., 1992; Hering and Sheng, 2001; Schikorski and Stevens, 1997; Sorra and Harris, 2000; Tashiro and Yuste, 2003). The postsynaptic density consists of densely packed ion channels and cell surface receptors in complex with cytoplasmic scaffolding and signaling proteins. Some of the proteins in the postsynaptic density provide a link to actin filaments, which represent the main cytoskeletal component of the spines. Microtubules, on the other hand, are abundant in the dendritic shaft and generally do not branch into the spines (Bernhardt and Matus, 1984; Kaech et al., 1997), although some components of microtubules have been detected in spines (Caceres et al., 1983; van Rossum and Hanisch, 1999; Westrum et al., 1980). Neurofilament proteins have also been detected in dendritic spines (Walsh and Kuruc, 1992), but the presence of neurofilaments in spines remains poorly characterized.

Some dendritic spines also contain elements of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, which in the larger spines assemble in a structure called the spine apparatus. Possible functions of the spine apparatus are to serve as a Ca²⁺ store and as a reservoir of receptors and ion channels readily

available for trafficking to the postsynaptic density during synaptic plasticity (Tarrant and Routtenberg, 1979). Polyribosomes and the elements of the endosomal-lysosomal pathway are also present in some dendritic spines, or near their base, suggesting that local protein synthesis from dendritic mRNAs, as well as protein degradation, can occur in the spines (Steward and Schuman, 2001). Interestingly, local protein synthesis may support the structural changes observed in spines that undergo synaptic plasticity, into which polyribosome tend to move (Ostroff et al., 2002). The endocytic machinery is also present in dendritic spines, where it is preferentially localized in the lateral domains of the spine, some distance away from the synapse (Racz et al., 2004). Mitochondria, although they are rarely seen within spines in mature neurons, also redistribute to dendritic spines during periods of active synapse formation or remodeling (Li et al., 2004). The functional significance of mitochondrial localization within spines is unknown, but dendritic mitochondria have been recently shown to be essential for the formation and/or maintenance of dendritic spines and synapses (Li et al., 2004).

Because spines protrude from the dendrite, they allow farther-reaching connections with axon terminals as well as higher synaptic densities (Sorra and Harris, 2000). In addition, dendritic spines play an important role in synaptic transmission between neurons. Ion channels in the postsynaptic density convert the chemical signal of neurotransmitters released by the presynaptic terminal into transmembrane ion fluxes, which generate electrical signals and other postsynaptic responses. The geometry of the spine facilitates signal transduction by providing a degree of biochemical compartmentalization. For example, the narrow neck can prevent increases in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ within a spine from rapidly dissipating into the dendritic shaft and spreading to other nearby spines (Koch and Zador, 1993; Svoboda et al., 1996). Spines may also function as electrical compartments (Nimchinsky et al., 2002; Segev and Rall, 1998; Svoboda et al., 1996). Although the passive electrical resistance of the spine neck seems unlikely to modulate synaptic currents, opening of voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ channels in the spine head could contribute to local regenerative electrical currents with a threshold that depends strongly on spine morphology. Furthermore, the size of a dendritic spine correlates with the size of the synapse and with the presence of functional α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type neurotransmitter-gated ion channels (Harris and Stevens, 1988, 1989; Matsuzaki et al., 2001).

Initial observations on dendritic spine structure were made through serial electron microscopy studies and three-dimensional reconstruction (Harris and Kater, 1994). These techniques provided a high-resolution but static view of dendritic spine structure. Today, high-resolution multiphoton laser scanning microscopy allows live imaging of dendritic spines even in deep brain tissue in vivo (Dunaevsky

et al., 1999; Lendvai et al., 2000; Levene et al., 2004; Mizrahi et al., 2004; Trachtenberg et al., 2002). Changes in dendritic spine shape can be monitored by labeling neurons with lipophilic fluorescent dyes or ectopically expressed fluorescent proteins, such as green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1A and B). Furthermore, localization and trafficking of specific components of the spines can be visualized by engineering a protein of interest fused to a fluorescent protein moiety. For example, actin dynamics in spines have been studied using actin fused to a green fluorescent protein (GFP-actin) (Fischer et al., 1998; Star et al., 2002) (Fig. 1C) and assembly of postsynaptic proteins has been studied using fluorescently tagged cell surface and scaffolding proteins (Bresler et al., 2004; Marrs et al., 2001). Even ion channels can be fluorescently tagged without noticeably affecting their functional properties (Crump et al., 2001; Luo et al., 2002; Marshall et al., 1995; Shi et al., 1999). Multiphoton microscopy combined with fluorescent proteins has provided in recent years new insight into spine development and function. As new fluorescently tagged molecules become available, their real-time dynamic behavior will provide information on how changes in spine form connect with the reorganization of actin-binding proteins and with changes in the molecular composition of the synapse.

In most regions of the developing brain, the formation of dendritic spines coincides with the main period of synaptogenesis in the first few weeks after birth (Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004). Developmental changes in the shape of dendritic protrusions reflect the progressive replacement of the thin, elongated, and highly motile filopodia characteristic of immature neurons with more stable dendritic spines, which acquire a mature morphology with a distinct head (Fig. 1E) and reach higher densities on the dendrite. Interestingly, the development of dendritic spines is impaired in neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by mental retardation (Fiala et al., 2002b; Kaufmann and Moser, 2000; Purpura, 1974; Ramakers, 2002) (Section 6). Patients with these disorders have abnormally long and thin dendritic spines with irregular shapes and increased or decreased densities.

Dendritic spines and synapses remain plastic in the adult brain. Spine formation, pruning, and remodeling in mature neurons can be induced by many factors, such as certain patterns of synaptic activity, learning and memory formation, hormonal fluctuations and changes in temperature (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999; Fifkova et al., 1982; Hosokawa et al., 1995; Kirov and Harris, 1999; Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999; Roelandse and Matus, 2004; Woolley et al., 1990; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). Most likely, some of the molecules that regulate spine formation and morphogenesis are the same that later control spine remodeling. Although much remains to be learned about the structure and function of dendritic spines, our knowledge has progressed substantially in recent years. In this review, we will highlight the current understanding

of the molecular mechanisms that regulate dendritic spines.

## 2. Spinogenesis: different views of dendritic spine origin

There are several different views on the origin of dendritic spines. One model is that dendritic spines originate from the dendritic filopodia that are predominant in younger neurons once these filopodia establish synaptic contact (Marrs et al., 2001; Vaughn, 1989; Ziv and Smith, 1996). Another model is that dendritic spines arise from synapses that initially form on the dendritic shaft (Harris, 1999; Miller and Peters, 1981). A third model is that spines can form even without synaptic contact (Sotelo, 1990). These views may not be mutually exclusive, as we discuss in the next sections.

### 2.1. Filopodia as spine precursors

During the early stages of synaptogenesis dendrites are bristling with many filopodia that rapidly protrude and retract with a lifetime of minutes (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Dunaevsky et al., 1999; Lendvai et al., 2000; Ziv and Smith, 1996). As synapses form, the number of filopodia declines and the number of stable spine-like structures increases, suggesting that filopodia are the precursors of dendritic spines. Ziv and Smith (1996) first succeeded in visualizing in real-time the formation of contacts between dendritic filopodia and nearby axons in cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons. They simultaneously labeled dendrites with the green fluorescent dye DiO and functional presynaptic terminals with the red fluorescent dye FM4-64. Based on these observations, a sequence of events was proposed in which filopodia encounter axons, engage in synaptic contact, and undergo a “filopodia to spine” transformation. This transformation involves a decrease in motility, substantial shortening, and localized enlargement of the distal portion of the filopodium to yield a mature-shaped spine, which typically contains a head and a neck (Figs. 1 and 2). More recently, live imaging of developing neurons in hippocampal tissue slices as well as in the neocortex in vivo has supported the hypothesis that synapse formation triggers the transformation of filopodia into spines (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999; Marrs et al., 2001; Okabe et al., 2001; Trachtenberg et al., 2002). According to this model, the function of the highly motile filopodium is to probe the space around the dendrite for an appropriate contact site on an axon. Interestingly, the release of the neurotransmitter glutamate promotes filopodial extension (Portera-Cailliau et al., 2003), suggesting that this may be a mechanism that guides filopodia to sites of presynaptic vesicle release. The axon guidance and cell adhesion molecules that are present on developing dendrites and axons may also contribute to direct the movements of filopodia and their subsequent selective adhesion to a compatible axonal partner.

### 2.2. Spine formation from the dendritic shaft

Spines have also been proposed to arise from synapses located on the dendritic shaft (Miller and Peters, 1981) (Fig. 2). This view originates from the observation that the majority of synapses in young pyramidal neurons are located on the dendritic shaft rather than on filopodia (Harris et al., 1992). As neuronal networks mature, the number of spine synapses increases and the number of shaft synapses decreases. In this model, axonal filopodia (and not dendritic filopodia) may be involved in finding an appropriate region for synaptic contact on the dendritic shaft. Although the movement of axonal filopodia in pyramidal neurons remains to be examined by live imaging, electron microscopy images have captured axonal filopodia in synaptic contact with the dendritic shaft (Fiala et al., 1998). Furthermore, live imaging of pyramidal neurons in hippocampal slices has documented the emergence of mature spines from shaft synapses (Dailey and Smith, 1996; Marrs et al., 2001). Therefore, it appears that spines can both emerge from the dendritic shaft and derive from filopodial precursors.

A combination of these two models has also been proposed based on three-dimensional reconstruction from electron micrographs (Fiala et al., 1998). In this case, filopodia that have established a synaptic contact retract, thereby pulling the synapse towards the dendritic shaft and transforming it into a shaft synapse that later gives rise to a dendritic spine. This sequence of events has also been
confirmed by live imaging experiments (Marrs et al., 2001). Transformation of the shape of a dendritic filopodium into that of a mature spine according to the first model described above also involves a retraction, which results in drastic shortening of the filopodium. Therefore, the timing of retraction versus enlargement of the spine head may determine whether a filopodium directly transforms into a spine or retracts into the dendritic shaft before the spine head emerges and develops a neck.

Time-lapse experiments have also shown that postsynaptic sites (marked by the presence of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein PSD-95 fused to green fluorescent protein) exhibit short-range lateral movements on the surface of filopodia and spines (Marrs et al., 2001). For example, these postsynaptic regions can move from the tip of a filopodium to its base. This may enable another mechanism whereby the filopodium establishes a synaptic contact near its tip, which subsequently translocates toward the dendritic shaft together with the axonal process attached to it giving rise to a shaft synapse from which a spine will emerge (Fiala et al., 1998).

In summary, the experimental evidence suggests that dendritic spine morphogenesis in hippocampal and cortical pyramidal neurons can occur through a combination of multiple mechanisms. However, we do not know if a particular mechanism prevails in vivo.

### 2.3. Spine formation without synaptic contact

In both models above, which are based on studies of pyramidal neurons, the formation of synaptic contacts induces the development of dendritic spines. Indeed, in the hippocampus and the neocortex synaptogenesis precedes spine formation. Furthermore, live imaging experiments have shown that loss of synaptic protein markers correlates with the disappearance of mature dendritic spines (Okabe et al., 1999), suggesting that signals generated by molecules localized at the newly formed synaptic junctions are required for spine stabilization. However, it seems that the presynaptic terminal is not absolutely required for the genesis of all spines (Fig. 2). In cerebellar Purkinje neurons protrusions shaped like spines seem to be able to form through intrinsic mechanisms that do not depend on axonal contact (Sotelo, 1990; Takacs et al., 1997). Indeed, the spines of the distal dendritic branches of Purkinje cells form before the establishment of synaptic contact with the presynaptic parallel fibers. Furthermore, mice with mutations causing the absence of parallel fibers still develop morphologically normal dendritic spines in Purkinje cells. Therefore, dendritic spines may emerge through different mechanisms in different types of neurons, perhaps owing to distinctive molecular compositions (Carlin et al., 1980; Mundel et al., 1997; Rao et al., 1998; Sekerkova et al., 2003; Wyszynski et al., 1998).

#### 2.4. Molecular implications of the different models

The different models outlined above are likely to imply different molecular mechanisms of spine origin. For example, if synaptic contact is required, intercellular signaling complexes assembling at sites of axon-dendrite contact are likely to be responsible for triggering spine formation, perhaps through bidirectional communication between the forming presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals. Several protein families have been proposed to trigger the genesis of dendritic spines through bidirectional signaling mechanisms. Intriguing evidence has implicated cell-cell communication mediated by cadherins and neuroligin-neurexin cell adhesion molecules as well as the EphB receptor tyrosine kinases and their transmembrane ephrin-B ligands (Section 4). However, many questions remain unanswered as to how these proteins participate in spine development. On the other hand, in the cases where the presence of a presynaptic terminal is not necessary for spine formation, entirely different mechanisms must be at play. These mechanisms, which would not depend on cell contact, are currently unknown. Perhaps a soluble secreted protein could induce the initial clustering of molecules that induces spine formation in Purkinje cells (Baloyannis et al., 1992; Seil, 1998; Shimada et al., 1998). Alternatively, unknown intrinsic signals could cause clustering of molecules at the sites where spines will form (O’Brien et al., 1998).

Several recent reviews have described in detail the phenomenology of dendritic spine development and plasticity (Sorra and Harris, 2000; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004). Here, we will focus on the molecular signals that drive these processes. This area of research is rapidly progressing, with new findings emerging at a rapid pace. Many proteins have been implicated in spine formation and remodeling and others likely remain to be identified, implying that complex networks of signaling interactions regulate dendritic spines. Further work, particularly through live imaging of developing spines and the analysis of knockout and transgenic mice, will be required to understand in detail how spine shape and function are regulated and to define the signaling cascades that link cell surface receptors to spine structural changes, which ultimately are orchestrated by actin.

### 3. Actin dynamics control dendritic spine development and remodeling

Actin is highly concentrated in spines compared to the dendritic shaft (Cohen et al., 1985; Kaech et al., 1997; Matus et al., 1982; Wyszynski et al., 1997) and the β- and γ-isoforms of actin, which are the isoforms expressed in neurons, are selectively targeted to spines (Fig. 1D). Within spines, actin is present as a soluble pool of monomeric G-actin and as polymerized F-actin filaments that confer the characteristic spine morphology (Halpain, 2000; Rao and
Craig, 2000). The actin filaments in the spine neck and in the core of the spine head form longitudinal bundles, whereas those at the periphery of the spine head are organized into a fine meshwork (Fifkova and Delay, 1982; Landis and Reese, 1983; Matus et al., 1982).

Actin organization in dendritic spines is dynamic and subject to regulation (Fischer et al., 2000; Matus et al., 2000; Smart and Halpain, 2000; Star et al., 2002). Recent measurements of GFP-actin fluorescence recovery after photobleaching in cultured hippocampal neurons showed that only approximately 5% of the total actin in spines is stable, while most of the actin almost completely turns over in a 2 min period (Star et al., 2002). Accumulating evidence suggests that actin rearrangements drive the formation and loss of dendritic filopodia and spines as well as their morphological plasticity. For example, actin stabilizing agents can prevent spine loss due to glutamate excitotoxicity in cell culture (Halpain et al., 1998). In addition, analysis of cultured neurons transfected with fluorescent GFP-actin showed that the actin cytoskeleton at the periphery of the spines undergoes continuous rapid rearrangements (Fischer et al., 1998). The rearrangements do not alter the dimensions of the spines, but involve extension and retraction of small filopodia-like processes from the surface of the spine head occurring with a time course of seconds. These ‘wiggling’ movements of the spine head are inhibited by treating cultured neurons with low concentrations of actin polymerization inhibitors, such as latrunculins and cytochalasins (Allison et al., 1998; Fischer et al., 1998), confirming that they are dependent on actin. In addition, latrunculin A transforms spines into filopodia-like processes (Zhang and Benson, 2001), implying that actin dynamics are essential for shaping the dendritic spine head. Pharmacological manipulation with latrunculins and cytochalasins may act by complex mechanisms that are not well understood and their effects could involve differential stabilization of different classes of actin filaments in the spines (Halpain, 2000; Rao and Craig, 2000; Star et al., 2002). Nevertheless, these and other experiments indicate that actin dynamics regulate dendritic spine morphology and motility in cultured neurons (Zito et al., 2004). The changes in spine morphology that have been observed in cultured hippocampal slices as well as in vivo over periods of minutes to days are also presumably driven by actin dynamics (Dunaevsky et al., 1999; Fischer et al., 2000; Lendvai et al., 2000; Trachtenberg et al., 2002).

The constant turnover of actin filaments in dendritic spines most likely involves the treadmilling of existing filaments, with polymerization occurring at the fast growing “barbed” ends, which are predominantly oriented towards the surface of the spine, and depolymerization occurring at the “pointed” ends (Pantaloni et al., 2001; Pollard, 2003). Branching and severing of filaments and nucleation of new filaments presumably also contribute to actin rearrangements within spines. A variety of actin-binding proteins regulate the assembly, stability, and disassembly of actin filaments. Some of these proteins, whose activities have

Fig. 3. The signaling cascades that regulate dendritic spine shape and motility involve cell surface receptors and ion channels, which activate signaling cascades controlling the activity of Rho GTPases and the Ca²⁺ concentration within the spine. Ca²⁺ permeable ion channels include neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, as shown, and voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels (not shown). Cell surface receptors include receptor tyrosine kinases and cell adhesion and recognition molecules. These receptors can bind soluble ligands, as shown, or ligands anchored to adjacent cell surfaces or to the extracellular matrix (not shown).

been extensively characterized in non-neuronal cells, have also been shown to impact actin dynamics in dendritic spines. A number of signaling cascades that regulate dendritic spine shape and motility originate at the cell surface and converge on these actin regulatory proteins (Fig. 3). Two major pathways involve the small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) of the Rho family and changes in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration.

### 3.1. Rho family GTPases

The GTPases of the Rho family—which include RhoA, Rac1, Cdc42, and many others that are not as well characterized—are key regulators of the actin cytoskeleton (Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2002; Ridley, 2001). The Rho family GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between an inactive (GDP-bound) form and an active (GTP-bound) form capable of binding to downstream effectors (Ridley, 2001; Van Aelst and D’Souza-Schorey, 1997). Guanine nucleotide exchange factors activate Rho GTPases by facilitating the release of bound guanosine diphosphate (GDP) and its replacement by guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTPase-activating proteins inactivate Rho GTPases by stimulating the hydrolysis of bound GTP to GDP.

3.1.1. RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42

RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 have distinct effects on actin organization in non-neuronal cells, as determined a decade ago by microinjecting DNA encoding these proteins into cultured fibroblasts. RhoA promotes stress fiber formation and increases cell contractility (Ridley and Hall, 1992); Rac1 induces lamellipodia formation and membrane ruffling (Ridley et al., 1992); Cdc42 induces filopodia formation (Nobes and Hall, 1995). RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 are ubiquitously expressed but present at high levels in neurons (Nakayama et al., 2000; Olenik et al., 1997). Rac1 and Cdc42 elicit the formation of cellular protrusions in neurons, and therefore promote neurite extension and attractive guidance (Luo, 2000). In contrast, RhoA causes growth cone collapse and neurite retraction, and therefore plays a negative role in neurite outgrowth and mediates repulsive guidance. Recent evidence indicates that the combined effects of different Rho GTPases also regulate the formation and remodeling of dendritic filopodia and spines. However, it is not known whether Rho GTPases are enriched in spines compared to the dendritic shaft and whether their localization in spines is regulated by external signals or synaptic transmission.

The first study to demonstrate that Rho GTPases can influence dendritic spine morphology examined transgenic mice expressing a mutant form of Rac1 with impaired ability to hydrolyze GTP in cerebellar Purkinje cells (Luo et al., 1996). This constitutively active form of Rac1 causes a dramatic reduction in the size of the dendritic spines but increases their density, in parallel with increasing the number of synapses. Consistent with these in vivo data, overexpression of constitutively active Rac1 in cultured hippocampal and cortical slices induces the formation of irregularly shaped protrusions resembling membrane ruffles and lamellipodia-like ‘veils’, which may consist of densely packed very small and thin protrusions (Govek et al., 2004; Nakayama et al., 2000; Tashiro et al., 2000). Furthermore, constitutively active Rac1 causes the formation of long and fine processes on the cell body and proximal dendrites of pyramidal neurons. In cultures of dissociated hippocampal neurons, constitutively active Rac1 also promotes the formation of lamellipodia-like protrusions, but disrupts synapse formation (Zhang et al., 2003) in contrast with its in vivo effects (Luo et al., 1996). On the other hand, overexpression of a mutant form of Rac1 that blocks exchange factors, and therefore acts as a dominant-negative, drastically decreases the number of both spines and synapses in cultured hippocampal slices and dissociated hippocampal neurons (Nakayama et al., 2000; Penzes et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003). Taken together, these data suggest that Rac1 promotes the development of new spines and that an optimal level of Rac1 activity is required for proper spine morphogenesis and the maintenance of normal spine morphology.

Overexpression of constitutively active and dominant-negative Cdc42 in hippocampal slices does not noticeably affect dendritic spines (Govek et al., 2004; Tashiro et al., 2000). However, in dissociated cultures of hippocampal neurons dominant-negative Cdc42 inhibits spine morphogenesis (Irie and Yamaguchi, 2002). This is in agreement with the finding that loss of Cdc42 function in neurons of the *Drosophila* visual system causes a reduction in the density of spine-like structures (Scott et al., 2003). These findings provide evidence for an involvement of Cdc42 in spine morphogenesis.

Other data support a role for RhoA in regulating spine morphology. Overexpression of constitutively active RhoA in hippocampal slices promotes spine retraction and elimination, thus reducing overall spine density (Govek et al., 2004; Tashiro et al., 2000). Consistent with this, inhibition of RhoA activity by expressing the C3 transferase exoenzyme results in more spines in some neurons and spines with long necks and resembling filopodia in other neurons.

It is clear that the GTPases of the Rho family play an important role in dendritic spine morphogenesis and remodeling and that different GTPases have distinct effects on the actin organization of spines (Fig. 4). For example, the extension of filopodia requires actin filament polymerization and elongation, which could be mediated by increased Cdc42 activity and/or decreased RhoA activity. Shaping a rounded spine head likely requires the assembly of branched actin networks, which is likely promoted by both Rac and Cdc42 (Irie and Yamaguchi, 2002; Penzes et al., 2003). Spine retraction is likely mediated by RhoA through an increased contractility of the actin filaments. Therefore, a temporal and spatial coordination among the activities of RhoA, Rac1, and Cdc42 seems to be critical for dendritic spine development and remodeling. However, some of the effects attributed to RhoA, Rac1, or Cdc42 by overexpressing constitutively active and dominant-negative mutants of these GTPases may be mediated by other members of the Rho family that share the same downstream effectors or exchange factors. Therefore, it will be important to investigate other members of the Rho family, particularly those with restricted expression in neurons and preferential localization in dendritic spines. Experiments using siRNA and knockout approaches will more selectively inhibit the function of specific GTPases and provide a more accurate view of how each Rho GTPase regulates actin organization in dendritic spines.

3.1.2. Other Rho Family GTPases

At least one other member of the Rho family, Rnd1, has been recently reported to regulate dendritic spines in cultured rat hippocampal neurons (Ishikawa et al., 2003). Rnd1 is highly expressed in neurons that bear dendritic spines, such as hippocampal pyramidal neurons, and its expression in the brain dramatically increases during the period of spinogenesis. Furthermore, Rnd1 was detected in brain synaptosomal fractions and in cultured neurons it is localized in or near dendritic spines. Unlike other members

Fig. 4. Signaling pathways downstream of Rho GTPases that regulate actin dynamics in dendritic spines.

of the Rho family, Rnd1 is always in its active form and membrane-bound (Foster et al., 1996). Overexpression of wild-type Rnd1 causes spine elongation, whereas reduction of Rnd1 expression by antisense treatment results in shorter dendritic protrusions that also retain an immature morphology. Although Rnd1 overexpression does not promote the formation of new spines, inhibiting Rnd1 expression slightly decreases spine density. A possible model is that Rnd1 promotes elongation of dendritic filopodia by inhibiting RhoA signaling (Nobes et al., 1998).

### 3.1.3. Regulators of Rho GTPase activation

The molecular mechanisms that lead to cytoskeletal changes in dendritic spines by regulating the activity of different Rho family GTPases are beginning to be defined. Some of the signals impact Rho regulatory proteins. Several exchange factors of the Dbl family, which activate Rho

contrast, expression of catalytically inactive kalirin-7 does not promote spine morphogenesis and decreases the number of dendritic protrusions. Moreover, reduced expression of kalirin using antisense approaches dramatically reduces the density of spines and synapses and causes the formation of thinner elongated spines (Ma et al., 2003). These data indicate that kalirin expression is necessary for spine maintenance and suggest that kalirin regulates dendritic spine morphology through Rac1 signaling to the actin cytoskeleton. It remains to be determined whether kalirin acts primarily by promoting Rac1 activation or by targeting activated Rac1 to dendritic spines (Penzes et al., 2003).

Intersectin is a multidomain protein that has been implicated in endocytosis (Guipponi et al., 1998; Hussain et al., 1999; Yamabhai et al., 1998). The long isoform of intersectin, intersectin-1, contains an exchange factor domain for Cdc42 and is preferentially expressed in the brain. Stimulation of Cdc42 by intersectin-1 in non-neuronal cells accelerates actin assembly via neural-Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP) and the actin-related 2/3 (Arp2/3) complex (Hussain et al., 2001). In cultured hippocampal neurons, dominant-negative forms of intersectin-1 or N-WASP inhibit spine morphogenesis in a way similar to dominant-negative Cdc42, suggesting that Cdc42-mediated actin polymerization in dendritic spines is regulated by intersectin-1 and N-WASP (Irie and Yamaguchi, 2002).

Another Rac1 and Cdc42 exchange factor that has recently been implicated in dendritic spine morphogenesis is the βPak-interacting exchange factor (βPIX), also known as Cool-1 (Zhang et al., 2003). This exchange factor binds the Rac1 and Cdc42 downstream effector p21-activated kinase (Pak1), thus facilitating the interaction of Pak1 with the activated GTPases. βPIX is ubiquitously expressed and is recruited to synaptic regions of hippocampal pyramidal neurons by binding to the adaptor G protein-coupled receptor kinase-interacting protein 1 (GIT1) (Manser et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 2003). Disrupting the synaptic localization of βPIX by mutating its GIT1 binding site causes an increase in dendritic protrusions but a decrease in mature dendritic spines and synapses. In contrast, disrupting the catalytic activity of βPIX inhibits the formation of both dendritic protrusions and spines with synapses. Thus, recruitment of βPIX to synapses and its catalytic activity are necessary for the formation and stabilization of synapse-bearing spines in cultured hippocampal neurons.

It is not known whether certain stimuli influencing Dbl exchange factors cause relocation of Rho, Rac1, and Cdc42 to dendritic spines, thus enabling access to effectors that regulate the spine cytoskeleton. It will be interesting to determine whether the recruitment of activated Rho family GTPases to spines by an exchange factor, rather than their activation, plays a role in regulating spine morphology (Penzes et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003).

Inhibitors of Rho family proteins are also expected to affect dendritic spines. Oligophrenin-1, a Rho GTPase-activating protein that is preferentially expressed in the brain, is present in the dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons and is required for dendritic spine morphogenesis (Govek et al., 2004). Knockdown of oligophrenin levels using RNA interference and antisense RNA approaches decreases the length of dendritic spines in hippocampal slices. Thus, although oligophrenin-1 can inhibit RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42, the physiological role of oligophrenin-1 may be to maintain physiological spine lengths by repressing RhoA and its downstream effector, Rho-associated kinase (ROCK). It remains to be determined whether the localization of oligophrenin-1 in spines depends on its interaction with the postsynaptic protein Homer and whether the changes in dendritic spine morphology induced by Homer and the associated scaffolding Src homology 3 domain and ankyrin repeat-containing (Shank) protein could be mediated by oligophrenin-1 (Govek et al., 2004; Sala et al., 2001). Although substantial information has been gathered in recent years on the effects of several regulators of Rho GTPases on dendritic spine morphogenesis and remodeling, much more remains to be learned.

### 3.1.4. Signaling pathways connecting Rho GTPases to the actin cytoskeleton

Extensive studies in non-neuronal cells have delineated the downstream regulatory mechanisms through which the Rho GTPases regulate actin dynamics (Fig. 4). Many of these mechanisms also operate in neurons. A major pathway by which Cdc42 likely promotes actin nucleation and branching in the dendritic spine head is by binding to N-WASP, a member of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome family of proteins that is highly expressed in neurons (Irie and Yamaguchi, 2002; Miki et al., 1996). The interaction of N-WASP with Cdc42, the acidic phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂), and other regulatory molecules activates N-WASP by relieving intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions (Fig. 4B) (Prehoda et al., 2000; Rohatgi et al., 1999). This promotes the ability of N-WASP to recruit G-actin and form a complex with the Arp2/3 complex. The activated Arp2/3 complex then nucleates actin polymerization and branching, which may be the mechanism leading to spine head enlargement (Higgs and Pollard, 2001) (Section 3.3.1). Cdc42 can also promote actin polymerization by binding to the adaptor insulin receptor substrate p53 (IRS p53) (Fig. 4B), which is localized in spines and known to regulate the actin cytoskeleton in non-neuronal cells (Abbott et al., 1999; Govind et al., 2001; Miki et al., 2000). By interacting with IRS p53, Cdc42 allows the recruitment of the postsynaptic scaffolding protein Shank and the enabled/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein (Ena/VASP) family member mammalian enabled (Mena) to the SH3 domain of IRS p53 (Krugmann et al., 2001; Soltau et al., 2002). Shank is a known regulator of dendritic spine morphology (Section 5.1). The IRS p53–Mena complex initiates actin filament assembly and bundling to form filopodia of non-neuronal cells (Mejillano et al., 2004). It is
not known whether this pathway also contributes to the formation of dendritic filopodia. An intriguing possibility is that the availability of certain effectors shifts the outcome of Cdc42 signaling from inducing filopodia formation to promoting spine morphogenesis (Mejillano et al., 2004).

Rac1 likely influences actin dynamics in dendritic spines by activating the Arp2/3 complex through WASP family verprolin-homologous protein (WAVE)/Scar family proteins, which are related to N-WASP but lack a binding domain for Rho family GTPases (Fig. 4A) (Miki et al., 1998). The adaptor IRSp53 seems to be the link between Rac1 and WAVE/Scar family proteins by mediating the formation of a trimeric complex (Miki and Takenawa, 2002; Miki et al., 2000). The binding of WAVE/Scar proteins to the SH3 domain of IRSp53 relieves intramolecular inhibitory interactions exposing the Rac1 binding site. Another protein that can bind to the SH3 domain of IRSp53 and favor Rac1 binding is espin, a recently discovered actin-bundling protein enriched in the dendritic spines of Purkinje cells (Sekerkova et al., 2003) (Section 3.3.10). Rac1 also promotes translocation to the cell periphery of cortactin, another scaffolding protein that has been recently shown to regulate actin dynamics in dendritic spines (Head et al., 2003; Hering and Sheng, 2003) (Section 3.3.6).

Both Rac1 and Cdc42 also activate Pak1, a serine–threonine kinase that phosphorylates and activates LIM kinases 1 and 2 (Fig. 4A and B) (Edwards et al., 1999; Yang et al., 1998). The LIM kinases, which are also serine–threonine kinases, in turn phosphorylate and inhibit the actin depolymerizing proteins ADF and cofilin to reduce actin filament turnover and cell motility (Section 3.3.3). On the other hand, RhoA promotes activation of LIM kinases through another serine–threonine kinase: ROCK (Fig. 4C) (Maekawa et al., 1999; Sumi et al., 2001). Pak1 and LIM kinase 1 have been implicated in regulating dendritic spine shape, although their effects are not identical (Meng et al., 2002; Penzes et al., 2003). This may be because in addition to LIM kinase, Pak1 can also affect the phosphorylation of the myosin light chain regulatory subunit of myosin II and thus influence actomyosin contractility (Fig. 4A and B). Opposite effects of Pak1 on myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation have been reported in various non-neuronal cells (Bokoch, 2003). Pak1 can directly phosphorylate myosin regulatory light chain and thus activate actomyosin contractility (Kiosses et al., 1999; Sells et al., 1999). On the other hand, Pak1 can also phosphorylate and inactivate myosin light chain kinase, a serine–threonine kinase that targets myosin regulatory light chain (Fig. 4A and B) (Sanders et al., 1999). The overall effect in this case is a decrease in myosin regulatory light chain phosphorylation and thus reduced actomyosin contractility. Recent analysis of mice in which the catalytic activities of Pak1 and the related family members Pak2 and Pak3 are inhibited in the postnatal forebrain confirms previous evidence of the importance of Pak activity in dendritic spine morphogenesis (Hayashi et al., 2004; Penzes et al., 2003). Cortical neurons

in the mutant mice have fewer and shorter spines, which however have an enlarged head correlating with a higher mean synaptic strength.

ROCK seems to be a major RhoA effector in neurons (Luo, 2002). In addition to LIM kinases, it phosphorylates myosin regulatory light chain—activating it—and myosin light chain phosphatase—inactivating it (Fig. 4C). These combined effects leading to myosin regulation are critical for the biological activities of RhoA and in dendritic spines should lead to increased contractility and spine shortening. Recent evidence suggests a role for ROCK in regulating dendritic spines downstream of RhoA because a ROCK inhibitor blocks the effects of activated RhoA in the dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons (Govek et al., 2004; Nakayama et al., 2000). Rho family GTPases also promote the synthesis of the acidic phospholipid PIP₂, which binds to N-WASP as well as several actin regulatory proteins and influences their activities (Chong et al., 1994; Weernink et al., 2004; Yamamoto et al., 2001; Yamazaki et al., 2002).

In summary, several pathways function cooperatively and interactively downstream of Rho family GTPases to regulate actin dynamics in spines. These pathways are also influenced by the concentration of cytoplasmic Ca²⁺.

### 3.2. Calcium

In dendritic spines, Ca²⁺ functions both as a charge carrier and as a signaling molecule that influences the activities of many proteins, including several actin regulatory proteins (Nimchinsky et al., 2002; Yuste et al., 2000) (Section 3.3) (Fig. 3). Therefore, changes in Ca²⁺ concentration affect the organization of the actin cytoskeleton with consequences on spine shape and synaptic strength. Ca²⁺ can enter spines from the extracellular space through neurotransmitter-gated ion channels—such as the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, Ca²⁺-permeable subtypes of AMPA receptors, and voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels. In addition, Ca²⁺ can be released from intracellular stores—such as the endoplasmic reticulum and the spine apparatus—in response to signals originating from cell surface receptors. The release of Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum is regulated by ryanodine receptors in the spines of hippocampal pyramidal neurons and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃)-gated receptors in the spines of Purkinje cells (Rose and Konnerth, 2001; Svoboda and Mainen, 1999). Ryanodine receptors are activated by Ca²⁺, such as the Ca²⁺ entering the spines through NMDA receptors (Emptage et al., 1999). IP₃ receptors are activated by IP₃ generated upon stimulation of metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are G protein-coupled receptors. Activation of receptor tyrosine kinases on the surface of spines may also lead to the generation of IP₃ (Jayaraman et al., 1996), although the contribution of receptor tyrosine kinase signaling pathways to Ca²⁺ release in spines
remains to be further explored. The presence of the endoplasmic reticulum, and thus the ability to release Ca²⁺ from internal stores within the spine, varies depending on spine morphology. The majority of mushroom-like spines contain endoplasmic reticulum, in contrast to only about 20% of the thin spines (Spacek and Harris, 1997).

Increases in Ca²⁺ concentration can have opposite effects on spine morphology depending on their magnitude and duration (Segal et al., 2000). Moderate and transient elevations in intraspine Ca²⁺ induce spine elongation (Korkotian and Segal, 1998, 1999a, 1999b). For example, caffeine-induced Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores through ryanodine receptors in spines of cultured hippocampal neurons causes significant spine elongation and the formation of new spines over a period of a few hours. Small increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ levels due to influx through NMDA receptors activated by low concentrations of glutamate also cause spine elongation and the formation of new spines. In contrast, large and sustained increases in Ca²⁺ levels due to high concentrations of glutamate cause spine shortening and in some cases collapse (Halpain et al., 1998; Segal, 1995). In turn, the geometry of dendritic spines has implications for Ca²⁺ handling (Korkotian and Segal, 1999a; Segal et al., 2000; Yuste et al., 2000). The thin spine neck, which is also sometimes occupied by the spine apparatus, hinders Ca²⁺ exchange between the interior of the spine head and the dendritic shaft. Therefore, spines with a thin neck and a large head are more efficient in confining Ca²⁺ transients compared to spines with a thick neck and a small head. This ability of dendritic spines to compartmentalize Ca²⁺ from the dendritic shaft and other spines may be a key feature of their function and also enable synapse-specific plasticity. It allows spines to operate as partially independent compartments where changes in Ca²⁺ concentration can be more or less pronounced and have different kinetics depending on spine morphology (Majewska et al., 2000).

### 3.3. Actin-binding proteins in dendritic spines

Numerous actin-binding proteins that function downstream of the GTPases of the Rho family and/or are regulated by Ca²⁺ have been shown to control the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines (Table 1). Other proteins that are known to regulate actin organization in non-neuronal cells are enriched in dendritic spines, but their role in influencing dendritic spine structure and motility remains to be conclusively demonstrated. In Section 3.3.10, we also briefly discuss this second class of actin-binding proteins. Given the modular nature of many of the actin-binding proteins, they can also serve as scaffolds mediating the assembly of multimolecular complexes. These complexes can receive and integrate inputs from diverse upstream pathways originating at the cell surface and convert them into changes in dendritic spine structure (Fig. 3).

#### 3.3.1. The Arp2/3 complex regulates actin nucleation and branching

The actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3) complex is the final target of many signaling pathways affecting cell shape and motility (Higgs and Pollard, 2001). For example, it is a major effector of Rho family signals and Ca²⁺-regulated actin-binding proteins (Fig. 4). The Arp2/3 complex consists of Arp2 and Arp3, which are related to actin monomers, and five other subunits. When activated by upstream signals involving WASP/Scar family proteins and cortactin, the Arp2/3 complex binds to the sides of actin filaments and initiates polymerization of branched filaments (Mullins et al., 1998; Svitkina and Borisy, 1999). The WASP/Scar family proteins bind both Arp2/3 and an actin monomer and promote the association of Arp2/3 with the side of the actin filament. The actin-binding protein cortactin (Section 3.3.2) also binds the Arp2/3 complex and activates its nucleation activity but less efficiently than WASP/Scar family proteins, perhaps because cortactin cannot bind monomeric actin. The Arp2/3 complex nucleates the formation of a new actin filament by mimicking the filament pointed end. The presence of an actin meshwork in the spine head and evidence that Rac1 and Cdc42–N-WASP pathways regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis (Irie and Yamaguchi, 2002; Penzes et al., 2003) suggest that the Arp2/3 complex plays an active role in shaping the enlarged spine head characteristic of mature spines. It will be interesting to determine if the Arp2/3 complex is enriched in the spine head, where filaments have a branched organization, compared to the spine neck and the body of filopodia, where filaments have an axial organization. It is also not known whether synaptic transmission regulates the activity or localization of the Arp2/3 complex to drive spine remodeling (Svitkina et al., 2003; Vignjevic et al., 2003).

#### 3.3.2. Cortactin promotes Arp2/3-mediated nucleation of actin filaments

Cortactin is an F-actin-binding protein that binds and activates the Arp2/3 actin nucleation machinery (Urano et al., 2001; Weaver et al., 2001). Through these interactions, cortactin plays a role in the stabilization, branching, and polymerization of actin filaments in concert with N-WASP and WASP-interacting protein (WIP) (Kinley et al., 2003; Urano et al., 2003; Weaver et al., 2002). The regions of cortactin that bind actin and Arp2/3 also mediate its preferential localization to dendritic spines (Hering and Sheng, 2003). Consistent with a localization dependent on actin filaments, synaptic stimulation and NMDA receptor activation causing the reorganization of actin filaments also induce a redistribution of cortactin from the spines to the dendritic shaft (Hering and Sheng, 2003). A possible model is that this redistribution of cortactin, and the opposite redistribution of profilin II (Section 3.3.4), Abpl (Section 3.3.10) and other proteins, play a role in the activity-dependent stabilization of the spine cytoskeleton (Ackermann and

Gain- and loss-of-function experiments also indicate a role for cortactin in spine morphogenesis. Overexpression of cortactin promotes spine elongation, whereas siRNA-mediated knock down of cortactin results in a drastic reduction in spine density. Remarkably, types of neurons that do not normally have spines develop dendritic protrusions when their low levels of cortactin expression are artificially increased (Hering and Sheng, 2003). The amino-terminal portion of cortactin, which contains the Arp2/3- and actin-binding domains, is sufficient for the spine-elongating activity, consistent with the ability of this region to promote actin polymerization and stabilize the actin cytoskeleton. In contrast, the carboxy-terminal portion of cortactin appears to mediate signals promoting spine morphogenesis, and particularly the enlargement of the spine head, because cortactin mutants lacking the carboxy-terminal region induce the formation of immature, filopodial-like dendritic protrusions. Although the signaling pathways involved have not been identified, the carboxy-terminal SH3 domain of cortactin binds Shank, a scaffolding protein in the postsynaptic density that also promotes dendritic spine morphogenesis (Du et al., 1998; Sala et al., 2001) (Section 5.1). It will be interesting to determine whether cortactin regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis in concert with Shank or dynamin, another protein known to interact with the SH3 domain of cortactin and to regulate actin dynamics near the plasma membrane (Orth and McNiven, 2003).

### 3.3.3. ADF/cofilin controls actin filament dynamics in spines

Cofilin and the related actin depolymerizing factor (ADF) are small proteins that bind cooperatively to the sides of actin filaments causing structural changes that promote depolymerization and severing of actin filaments (Bamburg, 1999; McGough and Chiu, 1999; McGough et al., 1997). ADF and cofilin are the main molecules responsible for actin filament turnover in vivo and can also bind to the monomeric G-actin (Ressad et al., 1998). Binding of ADF/cofilin to actin filaments is inhibited by tropomyosin, an F-actin stabilizing protein, and by PIP₂ phosphoinositides (Bamburg, 1999; Bernstein and Bamburg, 1982; Cooper, 2002). ADF is an abundant protein in neurons and cofilin is also found in the nervous system (Bamburg and Bray, 1987; Meng et al., 2002). The inactivation of ADF/cofilin has been implicated in the long-lasting increase in filamentous actin induced in dendritic spines by long-term potentiation (LTP), which is a lasting increase in synaptic effectiveness caused by certain patterns of high frequency electrical stimulation (Fukazawa et al., 2003).

ADF/cofilin are the only known targets of LIM kinases 1 and 2, which inactivate these actin depolymerizing proteins by increasing phosphorylation at Serine 3 (Arber et al., 1998; Sumi et al., 1999; Yang et al., 1998) (Fig. 4). Indeed, mice lacking LIM kinase 1 have decreased ADF/cofilin phosphorylation accompanied by significant abnormalities in dendritic spine morphology (Meng et al., 2002). LIM kinase 1-deficient dendritic spines appear to contain less polymerized actin and have thick necks and smaller heads with smaller postsynaptic densities compared to wild-type spines. In addition, abnormal deposits of actin and ADF/cofilin are observed along the LIM kinase-deficient dendrites, similar to those previously seen under conditions of ADF/cofilin hyperactivation (Minamide et al., 2000). These effects on actin dynamics may contribute to the defects in synaptic plasticity that characterize the LIM kinase 1 knockout mice.

It will be interesting to determine whether spine motility is also affected because ADF/cofilin are known to regulate cell motility in non-neuronal cells (Dawe et al., 2003; Ghosh et al., 2004). In particular, the availability of actin monomers generated by ADF/cofilin-mediated depolymerization at the pointed ends of actin filaments in dendritic spines seems to be necessary for polymerization at the barbed ends at sites of membrane protrusion (Carlier et al., 1997; Didry et al., 1998; Theriot, 1997). Another issue that needs to be clarified is whether LIM kinase 2 knockout mice (Takahashi et al., 2002) have similar dendritic spine abnormalities as the LIM kinase 1 knockout mice, which would imply that both LIM kinases contribute to regulating actin cytoskeleton organization in spines. The available data do suggest that ADF/cofilin are critical mediators of the cytoskeletal changes induced by Rho family GTPases and their downstream LIM kinases in dendritic spines (Fig. 4) (Arber et al., 1998; Edwards et al., 1999; Maekawa et al., 1999; Sumi et al., 1999, 2001; Yang et al., 1998).

#### 3.3.4. Profilin II contributes to activity-dependent stabilization of actin filaments

A dramatic example of a protein whose localization in dendritic spines is regulated by the concentration of Ca²⁺ is profilin II, the main profilin isoform in neurons (Witke et al., 2001). Profilin is a small protein that promotes actin polymerization near the cell surface by binding and positioning actin monomers at sites of actin polymerization and efficiently transferring them to the barbed ends of a growing actin filament (Carlsson et al., 1977; Dickinson et al., 2002). Multiple profilin–actin–ATP complexes are concentrated near growing actin filaments by preassembly on poly-proline membrane-associated proteins of the Ena/VASP and WASP families (Carlier et al., 1997; Gertler et al., 1996; Reinhard et al., 1995; Yang et al., 2000). Recruitment of profilin–actin complexes to this scaffold allows the efficient transfer of actin monomers to the barbed ends of actin filaments. Profilin also enhances actin filament nucleation by the activated Arp2/3 complex downstream of Cdc42 (Yang et al., 2000) and stabilizes actin filaments (Finkel et al., 1994; Rothkegel et al., 1996).

In cultured hippocampal neurons, GFP-tagged profilin II is recruited to the dendritic spine head when NMDA receptors are activated either pharmacologically or bypatterns of electrical activity that induce LTP and long-term depression (LTD, a lasting decrease in synaptic effectiveness caused by certain patterns of low frequency electrical stimulation) (Ackermann and Matus, 2003). This activity-induced accumulation of profilin II in dendritic spines, which persists for hours beyond the initiating stimulus, depends on sustained elevation of postsynaptic Ca²⁺ levels and on the association of profilin II with Ena/VASP family proteins. Although a major known effect of profilin in non-neuronal cells is to increase actin filament treadmilling and turnover in concert with ADF/cofilin, accumulation of profilin II in dendritic spines instead stabilizes a mature spine morphology and suppresses dendritic spine motility by reducing actin dynamics (Ackermann and Matus, 2003). Thus, profilin II seems to link activation of postsynaptic neurotransmitter receptors with the actin-based stabilization of synaptic morphology that may be important for subsequent synapse consolidation (Frey and Morris, 1998; Martin and Kosik, 2002).

### 3.3.5. Gelsolin can have opposite effects on actin filament stability depending on Ca²⁺ levels

Gelsolin is a widely expressed Ca²⁺-dependent actin-binding protein that severs actin filaments by inserting between two longitudinally associated actin subunits (Furukawa et al., 1997; Kinosian et al., 1998; Yin and Stossel, 1979). Gelsolin can also cap the barbed ends of actin filaments. While Ca²⁺ promotes binding of gelsolin to actin, PIP₂ phosphoinositides bind to gelsolin and cause its release from the ends of actin filaments, allowing filament elongation. Furthermore, in at least some cell types gelsolin plays a critical role in regulating actin dynamics downstream of Rac1 (Arcaro, 1998; Azuma et al., 1998). The effects of gelsolin on actin assembly in vivo appear to be complex. Despite its ability to sever actin filaments, in dendritic spines gelsolin may normally serve to stabilize actin filaments during synaptic plasticity (Star et al., 2002). This is suggested by the finding that in mice lacking gelsolin the activity-dependent decrease in actin turnover in the spines is impaired. This stabilizing effect may be due to the capping activity of gelsolin, which should occur efficiently at the Ca²⁺ concentrations reached in the spines after synaptic stimulation (Kinosian et al., 1998).

Higher Ca²⁺ concentrations are necessary to promote the actin severing activity of gelsolin (McGough et al., 2003). Gelsolin indeed appears to mediate the Ca²⁺-dependent depolymerization of actin filaments that is caused by toxic concentrations of glutamate in dendritic spines (Furukawa et al., 1997). In fact, hippocampal neurons lacking gelsolin retain polymerized actin and dendritic protrusions when they are exposed to high glutamate levels that normally cause actin depolymerization in wild-type neurons. This actin filament stability occurs even though the Ca²⁺ influx that occurs in the absence of gelsolin is even higher than that in wild-type neurons. Although actin dynamics in dendritic spines lacking gelsolin appear normal under basal conditions, short-term cultures of hippocampal neurons have many more filopodia extending from their neurites due to impaired retraction (Lu et al., 1997). These findings suggest a role for the severing activity of gelsolin in the degradation of actin filaments during filopodial retraction and during loss of dendritic spines caused by intense NMDA receptor activity. Although mice lacking gelsolin do not have overt structural alterations in the nervous system, quantitative analyses of spine morphology and motility in these mice have not been reported.

#### 3.3.6. Drebrin promotes actin bundling and inhibits association with myosin

Drebrin is an F-actin-binding protein mainly expressed in neurons (Ishikawa et al., 1994; Shirao et al., 1988). Drebrin A is the isoform of drebrin expressed in the adult brain and is highly concentrated in dendritic spines, where it associates with actin filaments (Allison et al., 2000; Hayashi et al., 1996; Hayashi and Shirao, 1999). Drebrin causes the formation of thick and curving actin bundles and changes in the shape of transfected fibroblasts (Shirao et al., 1994) and in cortical neurons it increases dendritic spine length (Hayashi and Shirao, 1999). The molecular pathways underlying these effects have not yet been defined. Drebrin may promote spine elongation by inhibiting the association of actin with myosin, thereby reducing the contractility of actin filaments and therefore spine retraction (Hayashi et al., 1996). It may also recruit profilin to dendritic spines, thus stimulating actin polymerization into filaments and spine elongation (Section 3.3.4) (Mammoto et al., 1998). Furthermore, drebrin may destabilize actin filaments and enable them to grow by dissociating α-actinin, tropomyosin, and gelsolin from the filaments (Ishikawa et al., 1994). This would inhibit the actin-bundling activity of α-actinin (Section 3.3.10) and the actin filament stabilizing activity tropomyosin and gelsolin (Section 3.3.5).

Recent data with cultured hippocampal neurons suggest that a physiological role of drebrin clustered at postsynaptic sites is to promote actin assembly and the synaptic clustering of PSD-95 (Takahashi et al., 2003). In these studies, drebrin clustering was found to precede PSD-95 clustering and suppression of endogenous drebrin A expression by antisense treatment disrupted synaptic clustering of PSD-95 (Takahashi et al., 2003). Thus, through interactions with actin and several actin-regulatory proteins, drebrin A may regulate spine morphogenesis and initiate clustering of actin filaments and postsynaptic components. An intriguing hypothesis is that drebrin confers distinctive properties to the actin filaments to which it binds (Shirao and Sekino, 2001). For example, in spines it may contribute to the stabilization of actin filaments against depolymerization by cytochalasin D (Allison et al., 1998; Asada et al., 1994) as well as contribute to the increased actin filament content in spines during synaptic transmission and plasticity (Fukazawa et al., 2003). Indeed, drebrin A undergoes a redistribution to spines after induction of LTP in the dentate
gyrus, concomitant with an increase in F-actin content (Fukazawa et al., 2003).

### 3.3.7. Spinophilin and neurabin I target protein phosphatase 1 to spines

Spinophilin (also known as neurabin II) and neurabin I are two related F-actin-binding proteins with similar domain structure that bundle actin filaments in vitro and modulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in dendritic spines (Feng et al., 2000; Nakanishi et al., 1997). Both proteins also contain a PDZ domain and form homo- and hetero-dimers through a coiled-coil domain. Spinophilin was named based on its prominent localization in the heads of dendritic spines observed in electron microscopy photographs (Allen et al., 1997). It predominantly localizes via its actin-binding domain to the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons, but not those of cerebellar Purkinje cells (Grossman et al., 2002; Satoh et al., 1998). Spinophilin appears to be required for the regulation of the properties of dendritic spines because spinophilin knockout mice have more filopodia and spines early in development, in addition to altered glutamatergic transmission (Feng et al., 2000). Thus, a physiological function of spinophilin may be to suppress the outgrowth of filopodia from the dendritic shaft or to promote their retraction. Multiple mechanisms could be involved. Spinophilin binds protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a phosphatase that regulates dendritic spine physiology, and targets this phosphatase to the postsynaptic element. In addition, spinophilin promotes the phosphatase activity of PP1 (Allen et al., 1997; Hsieh-Wilson et al., 1999). Thus, spinophilin may influence the activity of PP1 towards physiological substrates in dendritic spines, such as AMPA and NMDA glutamate receptors and myosin regulatory light chain (Fernandez et al., 1990; Yan et al., 1999). Spinophilin could also regulate dendritic spine morphology by promoting dephosphorylation of myosin light chain by PP1, and consequently inhibiting the assembly and contractility of actin filaments. Alternatively, spinophilin could modulate the stability of the actin cytoskeleton in spines by modulating ion currents through effects of PP1 on the phosphorylation of glutamate receptors.

Phosphorylation of spinophilin by protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) inhibits its binding to actin and, therefore, modulates the localization of the spinophilin–PP1 complex with respect to dendritic spines (Grossman et al., 2004; Hsieh-Wilson et al., 2003). Furthermore, spinophilin can form a complex with the Rac exchange factor Tiam1 and has been implicated in Rac1-mediated actin reorganization, at least in non-neuronal cells (Buchsbaum et al., 2003; Oliver et al., 2002; Stephens and Banting, 2000). Through its interaction with p70 S6 kinase, spinophilin may also regulate local protein synthesis in spines (Fukazawa et al., 2003). Despite the effects of spinophilin deficiency on the density of dendritic spines, the absence of spinophilin does not detectably affect spine size and shape (Feng et al., 2000).

Interestingly, the related protein neurabin I also affects dendritic spine density, but apparently in the opposite way (Oliver et al., 2002). Overexpression of neurabin I induces the formation of dendritic filopodia in immature cultured hippocampal neurons. It also promotes the enlargement of dendritic spines in older neurons. In hippocampal slice cultures, expression of a neurabin I amino-terminal fragment containing the actin-binding domain increases the density and length of dendritic spines with synapses concomitant with increases in actin polymerization and spine motility (Zito et al., 2004). This suggests a negative regulatory role of the neurabin I carboxy-terminal portion. Why neurabin I, which is also enriched in dendritic spines and binds a number of the same proteins as spinophilin (Nakanishi et al., 1997), may have opposite effects on the spines compared to spinophilin remains to be determined. Perhaps spinophilin inhibits the activity of neurabin.

### 3.3.8. SPAR, a Rap GTPase-activating protein

Another F-actin-binding protein that regulates spine morphology is spine-associated Rap GTPase-activating protein (SPAR) (Pak et al., 2001). SPAR contains two independent F-actin-binding domains (Act1 and Act2), a guanylate kinase (GK)-binding domain that binds the postsynaptic component PSD-95 and can link PSD-95 to actin filaments, and a GTPase-activating domain for the Ras family GTPases Rap1 and Rap2. SPAR is enriched in the larger dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons and this localization is mediated by the Act1 actin-binding domain. Overexpressed SPAR induces actin reorganization, leading to enlargement and irregular shape of the spine head and the appearance of spines that seem to bear multiple synapses. The ability of SPAR to promote spine head growth requires the spine localization mediated by Act1 as well as the Act2 actin-binding domain, the GK-binding domain, and the catalytic domain. Indeed, SPAR mutants lacking the Act2 domain cause shrinkage of spine heads and shortening of spine length, suggesting that this domain is important for the actin reorganization underlying spine enlargement. SPAR mutants lacking the GK-binding domain also fail to induce spine enlargement, suggesting that the interaction of SPAR with PSD-95 is essential for linking SPAR to its molecular targets in spines. Finally, SPAR mutants lacking the GTPase-activating domain cause the formation of longer and thinner spines and an increased number of filopodial protrusions, suggesting that SPAR mediates spine morphogenesis through inactivation of Rap proteins. Indeed, Rap2 has been detected in protein complexes associated with the NMDA receptor (Husi et al., 2000) and can directly bind to actin (Torti et al., 1999). However, the effects of Rap1 and Rap2 on spine morphology and the mechanisms by which these GTPases may influence the spine cytoskeleton remain to be investigated.

Interestingly, the levels of SPAR in the dendritic spines of a neuron are regulated by global levels of synaptic activity, which upregulate the expression of the polo family serine–

threonine kinase, serum-inducible kinase (SNK) (Pak and Sheng, 2003). SNK is produced in the cell body and targeted to spines, where it binds to the Act2 domain of SPAR and phosphorylates SPAR, causing its ubiquitination and degradation. Decreased levels of SPAR downstream of SNK may contribute to global synapse destabilization in response to elevated neuronal activity as part of a negative feedback mechanism. In contrast, the specific synapses that were activated would be stabilized through other overriding signaling pathways (Section 4.1.1).

### 3.3.9. Myosin II enhances actomyosin contractility in spines

Myosin, the major motor protein involved in cell motility, is present at high levels in dendritic spines where it associates with actin filaments, the spine plasma membrane, and membranes of the spine apparatus (Drenckhahn and Kaiser, 1983; Morales and Fifkova, 1989). Nonmuscle myosin II likely contributes to sculpt spine shape and regulate spine motility (Cheng et al., 2000). Myosin II enhances actomyosin contractility downstream of Rho family GTPases (Section 3.1.4) and when the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration increases. The effect of Ca²⁺ is mediated by Ca²⁺/calmodulin, which binds and activates myosin light chain kinase leading to phosphorylation of the myosin regulatory light chain (Means and George, 1988).

### 3.3.10. α-Actinin-2, a link between ion channel receptors and the actin cytoskeleton

α-Actinin-2, one of the α-actinin isoforms, is a member of the spectrin/dystrophin family of actin-binding proteins, which crosslink and bundle actin filaments (Shirao and Sekino, 2001). α-Actinin-2 is enriched in dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons (Rao et al., 1998; Wyszynski et al., 1998) and its overexpression increases the length and density of dendritic protrusions in cultured hippocampal neurons (Nakagawa et al., 2004). In spines, α-actinin-2 associates with the NR1 and NR2B subunits of the NMDA receptor and also with the spine apparatus (Rao et al., 1998; Wyszynski et al., 1998). Thus, α-actinin-2 may anchor NMDA receptors to actin filaments and together with actin (and possibly synaptopodin, Section 3.3.11) may provide a cytoskeletal bridge between NMDA receptors and the spine apparatus (Wyszynski et al., 1998). However, α-actinin-2 can be competitively displaced from the NR1 subunit by drebrin or Ca²⁺/calmodulin and thus may dissociate from the NMDA receptor as a result of Ca²⁺ influx in the postsynaptic terminal (Ishikawa et al., 1994; Wyszynski et al., 1997). Ca²⁺ also inhibits the association of α-actinin-2 with actin (Duhaiman and Bamburg, 1984). These effects of Ca²⁺ on α-actinin-2 may contribute to Ca²⁺-dependent inactivation of NMDA receptors (Ehlers et al., 1996; Krupp et al., 1999). Furthermore, α-actinin-2 may regulate the redistribution of NMDA receptors that occurs during synaptic activity. α-Actinin is also linked to AMPA receptors via the reversion-induced LIM protein RIL and participates in the regulation

of AMPA receptor trafficking within spines (Schulz et al., 2004).

#### 3.3.11. Other actin-binding proteins enriched in dendritic spines

A number of other actin-binding proteins are enriched in dendritic spines. Although concrete evidence for their role in spine physiology is not yet available, future experiments will likely reveal that many of these proteins contribute to regulate dendritic spine structure and motility.

Synaptopodin is a proline-rich actin-binding protein localized in a subset of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons of the postnatal and adult telencephalon but not in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum (Mundel et al., 1997). Interestingly, synaptopodin is sorted to the spine neck, where it associates with the spine apparatus and the smooth endoplasmic reticulum (Deller et al., 2000a). The expression of synaptopodin is upregulated following induction of LTP, suggesting a possible role in synaptic plasticity (Yamazaki et al., 2001). Indeed, synaptopodin-deficient mice completely lack a spine apparatus and have defects in LTP (Deller et al., 2003). It has been proposed that synaptopodin could affect spine motility by bundling actin filaments in the spine neck and perhaps influence Ca²⁺ release by linking the actin cytoskeleton to the intracellular Ca²⁺ stores of the endoplasmic reticulum (Deller et al., 2000b). However, the density and morphology of dendritic spines appear normal in synaptopodin knockout mice (Deller et al., 2003). Spine remodeling defects caused by lack of synaptopodin await examination.

Fodrin, also known as brain α-spectrin, is a component of the submembrane cytoskeleton that binds to actin filaments and crosslinks them (Glenney et al., 1983). It is a major component of the postsynaptic density and is enriched in dendritic spines where it can associate with calmodulin, the scaffolding protein Shank (Section 5.1), and NMDA receptors (Bockers et al., 2001; Carlin et al., 1983; van Rossum and Hanisch, 1999). In some dendritic spines of cultured hippocampal neurons, fodrin has been localized to dendritic spine necks whereas β-spectrin, which is a related protein that normally associates with fodrin, is instead enriched in the dendritic spine head (Ursitti et al., 2001). Whether fodrin and β-spectrin play a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis and remodeling remains to be established. Nevertheless, a role for fodrin in synaptic plasticity is suggested by the fact that fodrin is cleaved by the calcium-dependent protease calpain 1 in response to synaptic activity and as a result it can no longer bind actin (Harris and Morrow, 1990).

Actin-binding protein 1 (Abp1) is another component of the cortical actin cytoskeleton enriched in dendritic spines and associated with the scaffolding protein Shank (Qualmann et al., 2004). Given the several similarities in structure and function between Abp1 and cortactin (Section 3.3.2) (Olazabal and Machesky, 2001), it would be interesting to investigate whether Abp1 also regulates actin dynamics in
dendritic spines. Interestingly, however, prolonged synaptic transmission promotes the accumulation of Abpl in dendritic spines while cortactin moves in an opposite direction from the spines to the dendritic shaft (Hering and Sheng, 2003).

Several isoforms of the espin actin-bundling protein are enriched in the dendritic spines of cerebellar Purkinje cells, but not those of pyramidal neurons (Sekerkova et al., 2003). This is in contrast to spinophilin, synaptopodin, and α-actinin, which are instead enriched in the dendritic spines of pyramidal neurons but not those of Purkinje cells. This preferential expression of espin in Purkinje cells, its ability to promote actin filament crosslinking and increase the length of actin filament bundles, and its ability to function independently of Ca²⁺ suggest the intriguing possibility that espin may play a role in the distinctive ability of Purkinje cell dendritic spines to develop and persist in the absence of afferents (Loomis et al., 2003; Sekerkova et al., 2003) (Section 2.3). The ability of espin to bind IRSp53, a protein implicated in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton downstream of Rac1 and Cdc42 (Sekerkova et al., 2003) (Section 3.1.4), also supports a role in the regulation of dendritic spine structure. Despite these very suggestive findings, whether espin influences dendritic spine development, morphology, and dynamics remains to be demonstrated. It will be particularly informative to analyze dendritic spines in the available jerker mouse, which lacks espin (Zheng et al., 2000).

Another F-actin-binding protein that has been localized to dendritic spines and could play a role in spine remodeling following synaptic activity is inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 3-kinase A (IP3kinA) (Go et al., 1993; Schell et al., 2001; Yamada et al., 1993). Upon activation by CaMKII, IP3kinA phosphorylates IP₃ forming IP₄, which can no longer gate IP₃-dependent Ca²⁺ channels in the endoplasmic reticulum. This turns off Ca²⁺ release from internal stores following signals that stimulate IP₃ production. IP3kinA would be expected to affect dendritic spine morphology through these Ca²⁺ regulatory effects and perhaps also by binding to actin filaments and stabilizing them (Schell et al., 2001). Abnormalities in hippocampal synaptic plasticity have been reported in IP3kinA knockout mice but dendritic spine morphology remains to be carefully examined (Jun et al., 1998).

A challenge for the future will be to catalog the repertoire of actin regulatory proteins present in different types of dendritic spines and elucidate how their interplay fine tunes actin dynamics in order to regulate spine size, shape, and motility—and, therefore, the properties of neuronal circuits—in different parts of the brain.

cytoskeleton to support their structure, Ca²⁺ stores to regulate their activity, and in some cases even a protein synthesis machinery that locally regulates their pool of synaptic proteins. Furthermore, dendritic spines contain a variety of cell surface molecules that influence spine properties in response to external signals by mediating cell adhesion and by impacting Rho GTPases and Ca²⁺ fluxes to ultimately control actin dynamics (Fig. 3). Some of these cell surface molecules are located on the juxtaposed surfaces of the synaptic cleft and mediate communication between the presynaptic and postsynaptic terminals (Fig. 5). For example, they may be involved in trans-synaptic communication that mediates the development, maintenance, and/or modification of spines. Yet other molecules on the surface of spines are located outside synaptic regions and may be involved in communication with glial cells. Many mature spines are enwrapped by astrocytes that shield synapses from each other and possibly limit the extension of new dendritic protrusions and enhance the stability of existing dendritic spines (Araque et al., 1999; Haydon, 2000, 2001; Rusakov and Lehre, 2002; Ventura and Harris, 1999). Other cell surface receptors influence synaptic function by interacting with extracellular matrix molecules (Dityatev and Schachner, 2003; Pappas et al., 2001; Seil, 1998). In this section, we review our current understanding of the cell surface molecules that dictate the development, maintenance, and plasticity of dendritic spines through both adhesive and signaling functions.

### 4.1. Trans-synaptic signaling

Cell surface proteins that are involved in the interplay between presynaptic and postsynaptic elements are likely to be instrumental in triggering the initial formation of dendritic spines as well as modulating mature spine properties (Kossel et al., 1997). These cell surface proteins include the postsynaptic ion channels that are regulated by neurotransmitters secreted by the presynaptic terminal, the EphB receptor tyrosine kinases and their ephrin-B ligands, neuroligins and neurexins, and a number of other cell recognition and adhesion molecules that bridge the presynaptic and the postsynaptic terminal (Fig. 5).

#### 4.1.1. Neurotransmitter receptors

Neurotransmitters are small soluble molecules released from the stimulated presynaptic terminal. They diffuse across the synaptic cleft and bind to their receptors on dendritic spines. An important function of the neurotransmitter receptors, many of which are ion channels, is to elicit electrical signals that propagate in the postsynaptic cell. However, they also regulate actin dynamics and signal transduction in dendritic spines by increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ levels (Section 3.2). In this manner, activation of neurotransmitter receptors can induce the formation and remodeling of dendritic spines and influence their stability (McKinney et al., 1999; Portera-Cailliau et al., 2003; Yuste

and Bonhoeffer, 2001). Activity-dependent changes in spine numbers and morphology are believed to contribute to synaptic plasticity underlying learning and the formation of long-term memories (see Section 1).

Most excitatory synapses located on dendritic spines use glutamate as the neurotransmitter. The two major classes of glutamate receptors in spines are the ionotropic glutamate receptors—which include NMDA, AMPA, and kainate receptors—and metabotropic glutamate receptors. The different types of receptors are differentially expressed and regulated, but all of them can raise intracellular Ca²⁺ levels, at least transiently. NMDA receptors and some AMPA receptor subtypes mediate Ca²⁺ influx from the extracellular space. In addition, depolarization following AMPA receptor stimulation can cause Ca²⁺ influx through the activation of voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels. Metabotropic glutamate receptors initiate second-messenger signaling cascades that activate ion channels in the endoplasmic reticulum to induce the release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores.

The formation and fate of dendritic spines depends on the assembly of functional glutamate receptors at their synapses and requires sustained flow of signals from afferent neurons (Butler et al., 1998; Matus et al., 2000; McKinney et al., 1999). Currents mediated by AMPA receptors are required for spine stabilization and maintenance because complete inhibition of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices induces spine loss and atrophy, but low levels of AMPA receptor activation are sufficient to maintain spines (Matus et al., 2000; McKinney et al., 1999). Furthermore, AMPA receptor activation—which moderately increases Ca²⁺ concentration through voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels—also rapidly transforms the irregular profile characteristic of motile spines into a more regular shape with a rounded spine head, concomitant with decreased dendritic spine motility and stabilization of the spines (Fischer et al., 2000). Interestingly, the GluR2 subunit of AMPA receptors can also promote dendritic spine formation and morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons independently of its ion channel properties and likely through interactions mediated by the extracellular domain (Passafaro et al., 2003).

The NMDA receptors have also been implicated in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology. NMDA receptor stimulation leading to LTP in hippocampal slices results in the outgrowth of filopodia and spines with a time course of minutes to hours (Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999; Hosokawa et al., 1995; Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999; Toni et al., 1999). Prolonged changes in synaptic efficacy, such as those occurring during LTP, are also accompanied by increased numbers of synapses and structural remodeling of existing dendritic spines, including increased size of the spine and perforation of the postsynaptic density (Chang and Greenough, 1984; Desmond and Levy, 1988; Fiala et al., 2002a; Fifkova and Van Harreveld, 1977; Toni et al., 1999).

Consistent with the spine morphological changes, hippocampal LTP is accompanied by a long-lasting increase in F-actin content within dendritic spines (Colicos et al., 2001; Fukazawa et al., 2003; Geinisman, 1993; Kim and Lisman, 1999; Krucker et al., 2000). This is essential for LTP maintenance in vivo because drugs that inhibit actin polymerization suppress LTP. Remarkably, physiological levels of NMDA applied to cultured hippocampal neurons increase the stable pool of actin filaments in spines from 5% to approximately 60% (Star et al., 2002). Induction of LTD also increases the stable F-actin pool. These findings support the hypothesis that Ca²⁺ entry through NMDA receptors leads to a slower turnover of actin filaments, likely through Ca²⁺-sensitive actin regulatory proteins such as gelsolin, profilin, and possibly CaMKII (Ackermann and Matus, 2003; Jourdain et al., 2003; Shen and Meyer, 1999; Star et al., 2002). Other data support the importance of NMDA receptors in regulating dendritic spines. Mice lacking the NR3A subunit of the NMDA receptor have increased densities of dendritic spines in pyramidal neurons (Das et al., 1998). In addition, spine heads appear enlarged and spine necks elongated in the NR3A knock out mice. These data suggest that the presence of the NR3A receptor subunit lowers spine density in pyramidal neurons, likely because of the attenuating effects of this subunit on NMDA receptor-mediated Ca²⁺ fluxes (Das et al., 1998).

NMDA receptor activity is also required for the effects of estrogen on dendritic spines (Gould et al., 1990; Murphy and Segal, 1996). For example, the increase in spine size and density caused by estrogen in rat hippocampal pyramidal neurons occurs at least in part by a mechanism involving increased NMDA receptor activity as a result of decreased inhibition by gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA)ergic interneurons (Murphy et al., 1998; Rudick and Woolley, 2001; Woolley and McEwen, 1994; Woolley et al., 1997). The estrogen-dependent formation of new spines requires phosphorylation of the cyclic AMP response element binding protein (CREB) downstream of NMDA receptor activation (Murphy and Segal, 1997). These data suggest that increased NMDA receptor activation causes the generation of new spines through a mechanism involving CREB activation.

Thus, current evidence obtained using selective activators and inhibitors of different glutamate receptors suggests that stimulation of NMDA receptor activity leading to changes in synaptic efficacy, such as LTP and LTD, promotes dendritic spine development and morphogenesis while AMPA receptor activity stabilizes established synapses (Fischer et al., 2000). Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors has also been shown to cause morphological changes in dendritic spines, with a shift towards a more immature morphology (Vanderklish and Edelman, 2002). In summary, all of these findings indicate that spine morphology and stability reflect the history of prior synaptic activity.

Despite the positive effects of NMDA receptors on spine formation described above, NMDA receptors have also been reported to promote the pruning of spines, which is important for refining neural circuits (Bock and Braun, 1999; Lau et al., 1992). NMDA or glutamate application that results in a large and prolonged increases in intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration can cause spine shrinkage and collapse (Halpain et al., 1998; Segal, 1995). This is more likely to be a pathological than a physiological response, however.

New findings have also begun to uncover sophisticated mechanisms by which neurotransmitter receptors can stabilize certain spines while destabilizing others. Several recently discovered signaling pathways mediate a global destabilization of synapses, which is superimposed to the local stabilizing effects of Ca²⁺ in the activated synapses. These combined effects help to shape overall patterns of neuronal connectivity (Ehlers, 2003; Meyer and Brose, 2003; Pak and Sheng, 2003). Following elevated neuronal activity, for example, production of mRNA encoding the SNK kinase increases in the cell body of cultured hippocampal pyramidal neurons. SNK protein is then widely targeted to dendritic spines where it causes degradation of the actin regulatory protein SPAR (Section 3.3.8) concomitant with a decrease in mature spines and an increase of immature filopodia. Therefore, SNK could be an important contributor to NMDA receptor-mediated pruning of unstimulated spines. Two other proteins that cause destabilization of non-activated spines in a stimulated neuron are Homer 1a and CaMKII, which will be discussed in Sections 5.1 and 5.2, respectively. Therefore, pruning of unstimulated synapses following neural activity at other synapses in the same neuron may serve to strengthen active neural circuits and weaken inactive ones. The same mechanisms may also explain why prolonged pharmacological blockage of NMDA receptors in hippocampal slices increases the overall number of dendritic protrusions and promotes the appearance of filopodial-like structures (Kirov and Harris, 1999; McKinney et al., 1999; Portera-Cailliau et al., 2003). Additional proteins mediating global negative feedback mechanisms in stimulated neurons likely remain to be identified.

### 4.1.2. EphB receptors and ephrin-B ligands

The EphB receptors represent one of the two subgroups (EphA and EphB) of the large Eph receptor tyrosine kinase family (Kullander and Klein, 2002; Murai and Pasquale, 2003; Wilkinson, 2001). The binding of ephrin-B ligands stimulates the kinase activity of the Eph receptors, and typically the EphB–ephrin-B interaction involves a cell–cell contact because both the receptor and the ligand are transmembrane proteins. During nervous system development, Eph receptors and ephrins play important roles in the guidance of axons to their postsynaptic targets. In the adult brain several EphB receptors, including EphB1, EphB2, and EphB3, are expressed in dendritic spines (Buchert et al., 1999; Grunwald et al., 2001; Henderson et al., 2001; Torres et al., 1998). Therefore, it is conceivable that the EphB receptors may also participate in guiding the selection of

appropriate contact sites between dendritic filopodia and axons (Section 2.1). While this role remains hypothetical for now, the importance of the EphB receptors in the assembly of postsynaptic specializations and in dendritic spine morphogenesis has been recently demonstrated. Treatment of immature hippocampal and cortical neurons in culture with multimerized soluble ephrin-B1 ligand induces clustering of EphB2 receptors together with NMDA receptors and other postsynaptic components (Dalva et al., 2000; Penzes et al., 2003). Although EphB2 contains a PDZ domain-binding site at its intracellular carboxy-terminal end, the association with the NR1 subunit of the NMDA receptor is direct and mediated by the extracellular domain of EphB2. The PDZ domain-binding motif of the EphB receptors may instead contribute to the localization of several PDZ domain-containing components to the postsynaptic density. Proteins whose postsynaptic localization may be regulated by Eph receptors include the glutamate receptor-binding protein 1 (GRIP1), the protein interacting with C kinase 1 (Pick1), and the Ras-binding protein AF6 (Hock et al., 1998; Torres et al., 1998). Thus, EphB receptors may promote the assembly of postsynaptic proteins following interaction with a presynaptically localized ephrin-B ligand. Interestingly, the ephrin-B molecules may be either presynaptically or postsynaptically localized depending on the brain region (Contractor et al., 2002; Grunwald et al., 2004).

The EphB receptors trigger intracellular signaling cascades through interaction with cytoplasmic signaling proteins and tyrosine phosphorylation of target proteins. An intriguing possibility is that EphB receptor-mediated signaling pathways similar to those that cause the retraction of other cellular processes (Elowe et al., 2001) could be involved in the shortening of filopodia and their transformation into spines (Section 2.1). Treatment of cultured pyramidal neurons with ephrin-B ligands to stimulate EphB receptor signaling indeed rapidly transforms thin immature dendritic spines into mature ones, which are shorter and have enlarged spine heads (Henkemeyer et al., 2003; Penzes et al., 2003). On the other hand, inhibition of EphB receptor signaling by the expression of a kinase-inactive, dominant-negative form of EphB2 in cultured hippocampal neurons interferes with dendritic spine maturation, as judged by the persistence of filopodia and the decreased number of presynaptic and postsynaptic specializations (Ethell et al., 2001). Further supporting a physiological role for multiple EphB receptors in dendritic spine morphogenesis, dendritic spines have immature morphologies and reduced numbers in the hippocampus of EphB1, EphB2, and EphB3 triple knockout mice but not those of single or double knockout mice (Henkemeyer et al., 2003).

The downstream signaling pathways that link EphB receptors to changes in spine morphology are beginning to be elucidated. Two signaling pathways target the Rho GTPases, Cdc42 and Rac1, which may explain the actin cytoskeleton reorganization that accompanies EphB2-dependent spine morphogenesis. Stimulation of EphB receptors with ephrin-B2 in cultured hippocampal neurons upregulates Cdc42 activity through a pathway that involves the Cdc42 exchange factor intersectin and the Cdc42 effector N-WASP (Section 3.1.4) (Fig. 6A) (Irie and Yamaguchi, 2002). A Rac exchange factor, kalirin, has also been implicated in dendritic spine development and morphogenesis downstream of EphB receptors (Penzes et al., 2003). Treatment of immature pyramidal neurons in culture with multimerized soluble ephrin-B1 recruits kalirin to the clustered EphB2 receptor and causes rapid spine maturation through a pathway involving activated Rac1 and its effector Pak1 (Section 3.1.4). Ephrin-B-mediated activation of EphB receptors also induces tyrosine phosphorylation and recruitment to dendritic spines of a Rac1 exchange factor that binds spinophilin: Tiam1 (Section 3.3.7) (Fig. 6A) (Tanaka et al., 2004; Tolias et al., 2004). Furthermore, blocking Tiam1 function with dominant-negative mutants or by RNA interference causes a marked reduction in dendritic spine numbers, suggesting a role for Tiam1 in dendritic spine development. Other exchange factors for Rac1 and Cdc42 that are activated downstream of Eph receptors may also play a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis. These exchange factors could include the Pak1-interacting exchange factor αPIX, which is related to βPIX (Section 3.1.3) (Yoshii et al., 1999).

Another pathway that may play a role in spine development and morphogenesis involves potentiation of NMDA receptor-mediated Ca²⁺ currents by EphB receptors (Sections 3.2 and 4.1.1) (Takasu et al., 2002). EphB receptors activate the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases (Grunwald et al., 2001; Zisch et al., 1998), which in turn phosphorylate NMDA receptors on tyrosine residues and increase channel gating (Fig. 6A) (Salter and Kalia, 2004). Phosphorylation of NMDA receptors by Src family kinases may also increase Ca²⁺ currents by stabilizing NMDA receptors on the cell surface. Finally, tyrosine phosphorylation of the proteoglycan syndecan-2 has also been implicated in the regulation of spine morphogenesis downstream of EphB receptors (Fig. 6A) (Section 4.2.2) (Ethell et al., 2001).

The EphB receptor–ephrin-B interaction also generates “reverse” signals in the ephrin-B-expressing cells. These signals, which are mediated by the cytoplasmic domain of the ephrin-B molecules, likely also contribute to trans-synaptic communication (Contractor et al., 2002; Grunwald et al., 2004). Interestingly, in area CA1 of the hippocampus ephrin-B ligands have been detected in dendritic spines, where they are required for synaptic plasticity (Grunwald et al., 2004). All three ephrin-B ligands have a PDZ domain-binding motif at their carboxy terminus, which binds various PDZ domain-containing components of the postsynaptic density, including GRIP1 and GRIP2, Pick1, and syntenin (Bruckner et al., 1999; Lin et al., 1999; Torres et al., 1998). However, the effects of ephrin-B signaling on spine development and remodeling are not yet known. It will

be interesting to examine whether the trans-synaptic communication mediated by EphB receptors and ephrin-B molecules may be responsible for trans-endocytosis via double-membrane invaginations called spinules (Marston et al., 2003; Spacek and Harris, 2004; Zimmer et al., 2003). Trans-endocytosis of spinules containing juxtaposed presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes into the presynaptic terminal has been proposed to mediate retrograde signals and the coordinated remodeling of dendritic spines and their presynaptic terminals (Spacek and Harris, 2004).

### 4.1.3. Neuroligins and neurexins

Another family of proteins that mediate recognition between dendrites and axons and the specification of excitatory synapses are the neuroligins (Fig. 5). Neuroligins 1, 2, 3, and 4 are transmembrane brain-specific proteins enriched in the postsynaptic density (Bolliger et al., 2001; Ichtchenko et al., 1995, 1996; Song et al., 1999). Their extracellular domain is homologous to serine esterases, but catalytically inactive, and their short cytoplasmic tail contains a PDZ domain-binding motif (Irie et al., 1997; Kornau et al., 1997). Neuroligins bind to certain splice variants of β-neurexins, which are a family of brain-specific cell surface proteins located in the presynaptic terminal (Dean et al., 2003; Ullrich et al., 1995; Ushkaryov et al., 1992). The Ca²⁺-dependent interaction between postsynaptic neuroligins and presynaptic β-neurexins mediates cell–cell adhesion and contributes to the initiation of synaptic contacts (Dean et al., 2003; Nguyen and Sudhof, 1997; Scheiffele et al., 2000). Remarkably, neuroligin 1 and neuroligin 2 can trigger the formation of functional presynaptic specializations through β-neurexins even when the neuroligins are expressed in non-neuronal cells (Scheiffele et al., 2000). Intracellularly, neuroligins bind a PDZ domain of the postsynaptic scaffold protein PSD-95 (Bolliger et al., 2001; Irie et al., 1997), which may link neuroligins to NMDA receptors. Recently, neuroligin 1 was indeed found to recruit postsynaptic glutamate receptors and induce the formation of dendritic spines (Chih et al., 2004b). Thus, it appears that neuroligins and β-neurexins function in concert to drive the differentiation of both presynaptic and postsynaptic structures in excitatory synapses. The signaling pathways activated downstream of the neuroligins in dendritic spines are unknown. Possible cooperative effects of neuroligins/neurexins with Eph receptors/ephrins and other trans-synaptic signaling factors in the regulation of dendritic spine morphogenesis also remain to be elucidated.

### 4.1.4. Cadherins

Besides neuroligins and neurexins, several other families of cell adhesion and recognition molecules have been shown to regulate synapses and dendritic spines. The cadherins are a large class of mostly homophilic cell–cell adhesion molecules present in synapses (Fig. 5) (Bruses, 2000; Fannon and Colman, 1996; Shapiro and Colman, 1999; Takai et al., 2003; Uchida et al., 1996; Uemura, 1998; Yagi and Takeichi, 2000). They are symmetrically localized in the puncta adherentia, which are adhesive junctions that surround the active zone in the presynaptic terminal and the postsynaptic density in the postsynaptic terminal.

Ultrastructurally, the puncta adherentia resemble the adherens junctions of epithelial cells. The cadherins comprise the classical cadherins and the protocadherins, which include the three distinct gene clusters of the protocadherin-α family (also known as cadherin-related neuronal receptors) and the protocadherin-β and -γ families, in addition to several other genes (Kohmura et al., 1998; Uemura, 1998; Wu and Maniatis, 1999; Yagi and Takeichi, 2000; Yamagata et al., 1999, 2003). Both classical cadherins and protocadherins are single-pass transmembrane proteins that contain five or more “cadherin repeats” in their extracellular domains. The most amino-terminal cadherin repeat mediates Ca²⁺-dependent homophilic adhesion. The cytoplasmic domains are divergent between different cadherin families and mediate distinctive protein interactions important for linkage to the actin cytoskeleton and for signal transduction.

Given their extremely large numbers, individual adhesive specificities and differential expression patterns, the cadherins are good candidates for determining the specificity of synaptic connections. Several protocadherins are indeed expressed in different combinations in subpopulations of neurons of the same type, thus creating a cadherin “code” that may help match synaptic partners (Kohmura et al., 1998; Redies, 2000). In addition, N-cadherin—a classical cadherin—is expressed in all early synapses in cultured hippocampal neurons but during synapse maturation becomes restricted to a subpopulation of excitatory synapses and is lost from inhibitory synapses (Benson and Tanaka, 1998). Furthermore, several classical cadherins are present in the brain and selectively expressed in specific neuronal pathways (Arndt and Redies, 1998; Colman, 1997; Fannon and Colman, 1996; Manabe et al., 2000).

Recent evidence supports the idea that cadherins regulate dendritic spine morphogenesis. For example, inhibition of classical cadherins by overexpression of a truncated, dominant-negative form of N-cadherin lacking part of the extracellular domain delays spine morphogenesis in cultured hippocampal neurons (Togashi et al., 2002). The spines in neurons overexpressing the dominant-negative N-cadherin are elongated and have small heads. Although they resemble immature filopodia and have irregular and sometimes bifurcated shapes, these spines retain their synaptic contacts. The distribution of postsynaptic proteins and presynaptic vesicle recycling are also disrupted by inhibition of cadherin function. The effects on dendritic spines are more pronounced at early stages of synaptogenesis, suggesting that cadherins play a more important role during synapse formation whereas other adhesive molecules may substantially contribute to stabilize mature synapses. While dominant-negative N-cadherin presumably inhibits the activities of multiple cadherins, mice expressing a nonfunctional truncated form of cadherin 11 do not have obvious structural defects in their synapses, suggesting functional redundancies with other cadherins in the regulation of dendritic spine morphology (Manabe et al.,

2000). The cadherin 11-deficient mice exhibit enhanced LTP in the hippocampus, however, perhaps because slightly decreased cell–cell adhesion more readily enables synaptic remodeling and structural plasticity (Manabe et al., 2000). Further studies are needed to explain why disrupting adhesion mediated by other classical cadherins with antibodies or peptides has an opposite effect compared to cadherin 11 gene inactivation and impairs LTP (Bozdagi et al., 2000; Tanaka et al., 2000; Tang et al., 1998).

The adhesive activity of classical cadherins is regulated by a complex of α-catenin and β-catenin, which provide an intracellular link between cadherins and the actin cytoskeleton and may also have a signaling function (Fig. 6B) (Ozawa et al., 1990). β-catenin directly associates with the cytoplasmic domain of cadherins as well as with α-catenin, which in turn mediates interactions with F-actin (Hirano et al., 1992; Nagafuchi et al., 1994). Cultured hippocampal neurons deficient in αN-catenin, a subtype of α-catenin that is specifically expressed in the nervous system and associates with multiple cadherins (Uchida et al., 1994), develop elongated dendritic spines (Togashi et al., 2002). However, the morphological defects are less pronounced compared to neurons that overexpress dominant-negative N-cadherin because the spine heads are not reduced in size and the localization of synaptic proteins does not appear disrupted. This may be explained by the fact that lack of αN-catenin reduces but does not abolish the cadherin adhesive properties, which may be required for the maintenance of the spine head while a cytoplasmic link to the actin cytoskeleton may be required for the shortening of spine length. Alternatively, the presence of other catenins may compensate for the loss of αN-catenin. Interestingly, a major effect of αN-catenin was revealed by time-lapse microscopy observation (Abe et al., 2004). In the absence of αN-catenin dendritic spines are more motile, with filopodia rapidly protruding and retracting from the spine heads, suggesting that synaptic contacts are not stable. Conversely, overexpression of αN-catenin accelerates dendritic spine maturation and decreases spine motility, suggesting that αN-catenin promotes spine morphogenesis and stabilization. Since αN-catenin appears to accumulate in activated synapses, this protein may mediate neural-activity-dependent signals that stabilize synapses by suppressing motility and turnover.

Depolarization and synaptic activity also induce the relocation of β-catenin from the dendritic shaft into spines and promote β-catenin association with cadherin in hippocampal neurons (Abe et al., 2004; Murase et al., 2002). Interestingly, the spine recruitment of β-catenin and its affinity for cadherins is enhanced by inhibiting its tyrosine phosphorylation (Murase et al., 2002). Furthermore, enhanced recruitment of a phosphorylation-deficient β-catenin mutant to dendritic spines correlates with the enlargement of synapses and with increased synaptic transmission. These findings suggest that neural activity negatively regulates tyrosine phosphorylation of β-catenin,
thus promoting association of β-catenin with the cadherins present in dendritic spines and an increase in synaptic strength.

It will be interesting to determine whether Rho family GTPases activated downstream of the cadherin–catenin complex play a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis (Chauvet et al., 2003; Nakagawa et al., 2001; Noren et al., 2001; Okabe et al., 2003). On the other hand, cadherins of the protocadherin-α family may also signal through the tyrosine kinase Fyn, which binds to their cytoplasmic domain (Kohmura et al., 1998). However, more work is needed to determine which aspects of dendritic spine development are influenced by the three protocadherin families and identify the cytoplasmic proteins that associate with the protocadherins of the β- and γ-families.

### 4.1.5. Synaptic cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily

The nectins are a novel family of Ca²⁺-independent cell adhesion molecules that function in concert with cadherins in various types of adherens junctions, including the puncta adherentia junctions of neuronal synapses (Fig. 5) (Mizoguchi et al., 2002; Takai and Nakanishi, 2003; Takai et al., 2003). Four nectins are known, which contain three immunoglobulin-like domains in their extracellular region. The nectins also have a PDZ domain-binding motif at the carboxy-terminal end of their cytoplasmic region, which binds the PDZ domain of afadin. Afadin is an F-actin-binding protein that connects the nectins to the actin cytoskeleton. The nectins are likely to play both an adhesive and a signaling role in dendritic spines. Given their ability to activate Rac1 and Cdc42 (Fig. 6C) (Kawakatsu et al., 2002), they would be expected to promote dendritic spine morphogenesis. However, this effect remains to be investigated. It has been shown, however, that inhibiting nectin 1 causes an abnormal distribution of synaptic proteins and a decrease in the size of synapses with a concomitant increase in synapse numbers (Mizoguchi et al., 2002). Although the molecular basis is not yet known, these effects suggest that nectins play an important role in determining the position and size of nascent synapses. Impairment of the function of nectin 1 in synapses due to mutations may be a cause of mental retardation (Sozen et al., 2001; Suzuki et al., 2000).

Another recently identified cell adhesion molecule of the immunoglobulin superfamily localized in synapses is SynCAM1 (Biederer et al., 2002). SynCAM1 belongs to a family of five proteins that have a domain structure similar to the nectins (Shingai et al., 2003). The carboxy-terminal PDZ domain-binding motif of SynCAM1 binds several synaptic PDZ domain-containing proteins, but not afadin. Consistent with these binding interactions, SynCAM1 is present in both the presynaptic and postsynaptic compartments and mediates Ca²⁺-independent homophilic interactions, but can also bind SynCAM3 and nectin-3 on apposing cell surfaces. Overexpression of SynCAM1 in cultured neurons increases spontaneous synaptic activity while the isolated cytoplasmic tail of SynCAM1 inhibits synapse formation and function, possibly by acting as a dominant-negative (Biederer et al., 2002). Consistent with an important role in synaptogenesis, co-expression of SynCAM1 and GluR2 glutamate receptors in non-neuronal cells induces the formation of functional presynaptic terminals in nearby hippocampal neurons. Remarkably, these presynaptic terminals are juxtaposed to functional glutamate receptor clusters in the non-neuronal cells, suggesting that SynCAM1 is sufficient to drive synapse assembly. However, its effects on dendritic spine morphology remain to be determined.

Two other Ca²⁺-independent cell adhesion molecules of the immunoglobulin superfamily, L1 and neuronal-cell adhesion molecule (N-CAM), are also present in synapses (Fig. 5) (Fields and Itoh, 1996; Luthl et al., 1994; Persohn et al., 1989; Persohn and Schachner, 1990; Schuster et al., 2001). Both proteins contain fibronectin type III repeats in the extracellular domain and their short cytoplasmic domains anchor them to the cytoskeleton and links them to intracellular signaling pathways (Rougon and Hobert, 2003; Schachner, 1997). N-CAM is believed to be involved in the initial assembly of synaptic components (Sytnyk et al., 2002). Although it does not appear to be absolutely required for the establishment of synapses, studies using mixed cultures of hippocampal neurons from N-CAM knockout and wild-type mice revealed that postsynaptic N-CAM promotes the formation and increases the strength of excitatory synapses in concert with NMDA receptor activity (Dityatev et al., 2000). Many studies on L1 and N-CAM have focused on synaptic plasticity, demonstrating that interfering with the function of either of these proteins impairs LTP in hippocampal neurons (Cotman et al., 1998; Cremer et al., 1998; Fields and Itoh, 1996; Kiss and Muller, 2001; Luthl et al., 1994; Muller et al., 1996; Murase and Schuman, 1999; Ronn et al., 1995; Schachner, 1997). However, studies with L1 knockout mice show that L1 is not absolutely required for the establishment and maintenance of LTP (Bliss et al., 2000). Interestingly, a synthetic peptide mimicking N-CAM function has been recently shown to promote synaptogenesis and enhance synaptic efficacy in hippocampal neurons, and to facilitate memory consolidation (Cambon et al., 2004). Neural stimulation that induces synaptic plasticity upregulates N-CAM expression, suggesting that N-CAM may contribute to the changes in synapse geometry occurring in activated synapses. However, the effects of L1 and N-CAM on dendritic spine morphology and motility have not been investigated directly.

The number of cell adhesion proteins of the immunoglobulin superfamily found to be localized in synapses continues to increase and includes a number of newly discovered proteins (Yamagata et al., 2003). Given the importance of adhesion complexes in regulating synaptic size and strength, future studies will likely demonstrate that some of the immunoglobulin superfamily proteins found in synapses play a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis and
plasticity. Clarifying the contribution of the structural versus signaling roles of trans-synaptic cell adhesion molecules is another challenge for future investigations.

### 4.1.6. Neurotrophin and growth factor receptors

Several families of receptor tyrosine kinases, in addition to the Eph receptors (Section 4.1.2), are present in neuronal synapses and have been implicated in synaptic plasticity. They include the receptors for insulin and insulin-like growth factors (Abbott et al., 1999; Ahmadian et al., 2004; Nieto-Bona et al., 1997; Skeberdis et al., 2001), the fibroblast growth factor receptor family, which is known to cooperate with the cell adhesion molecule N-CAM (Section 4.1.5) (Cambon et al., 2004; Ishikawa et al., 1994; Kiryushko et al., 2003; Terlau and Seifert, 1990), and the Trk family of neurotrophin receptors (Fig. 5) (Ikegaya et al., 2002; Kang et al., 1997; Kovalchuk et al., 2002; McAllister et al., 1999; Poo, 2001; Purcell et al., 2003; Vicario-Abejon et al., 2002; Wu et al., 1996). Neurotrophins and growth factors are molecules that can be secreted from the presynaptic or postsynaptic terminal and transported trans-synaptically, although in some cases they can also be derived from glial cells surrounding the synapse (McAllister et al., 1999; Nieto-Bona et al., 1997; Poo, 2001; Vicario-Abejon et al., 2002). Interestingly, the expression and secretion of neurotrophins are regulated by synaptic and electrical activity.

Activation of neurotrophin and growth factor receptors in turn affects LTP and LTD and it is conceivable that this may occur through downstream signaling pathways that influence the structure of dendritic spines (Poo, 2001). Indeed, insulin-like growth factor 1 has been implicated in maintaining the size of Purkinje cell dendritic spines (Nieto-Bona et al., 1997). Furthermore, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), a neurotrophin ligand for the TrkB receptor, has been shown to increase dendritic spine density in cultures of cerebellar Purkinje neurons while sequestering BDNF causes elongation of the spine neck (Shimada et al., 1998). BDNF also decreases the diameter of dendritic protrusions when acutely applied to main olfactory bulb slices (Matsutani and Yamamoto, 2004) and destabilizes dendrites and spines when overexpressed in cortical slices, resulting in fewer spines that rapidly undergo remodeling (Horch et al., 1999).

### 4.2. Receptors for extracellular matrix proteins

The extracellular space in the adult central nervous system is occupied by extracellular matrix molecules forming a “perineuronal net” that surrounds neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (Bruckner et al., 1993; Celio, 1999; Ruoslahti, 1996; Yamaguchi, 2000). Extracellular matrix molecules have been detected around synapses and dendritic spines (Dityatev and Schachner, 2003; Pappas et al., 2001; Rodriguez et al., 2000; Tian et al., 1997). Furthermore, synaptic plasticity is affected by perturbing the expression and activity of chondroitin sulphate proteoglycans such as brevican and neurocan and of extracellular matrix glycoproteins such as laminin, reelin, tenascin-R, tenascin-C, and heparin-binding growth-associated molecule (HB-GAM) (reviewed in Dityatev and Schachner, 2003). These extracellular matrix molecules have positive effects on LTP, except for HB-GAM, which inhibits LTP. Furthermore, extracellular matrix degradation by tissue plasminogen activator has been recently implicated in the spine loss that occurs in the visual cortex during experience-dependent pruning (Mataga et al., 2004; Oray et al., 2004).

The effects of the extracellular matrix on synaptic efficacy are mediated by cell surface receptors that regulate cell adhesion and activate intracellular signaling cascades. These receptors include integrins, apolipoprotein E, the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, cell surface-associated heparan sulfate proteoglycans, N-CAM and L1, and even ion channels (Bandtlow and Zimmermann, 2000; Dityatev and Schachner, 2003; Rice and Curran, 2001). Although the molecular mechanisms by which the extracellular matrix affects synaptic efficacy are not completely understood, activity-dependent remodeling of the matrix may lead to changes in the structure of synapses and effects on the volume and geometry of the extracellular space thus influencing neurotransmitter diffusion. In addition, integrins and cell surface-anchored proteoglycans have been shown to affect dendritic spine morphology.

#### 4.2.1. Integrins

The integrins are a large family of heterodimeric membrane-spanning receptors for various extracellular matrix ligands and comprise an α and a β subunit (Fig. 5) (Fields and Itoh, 1996; Geiger et al., 2001; Schwartz, 2001). Each integrin subunit has a single transmembrane domain connecting the extracellular ligand-binding domain to a cytoplasmic domain. The cytoplasmic domains mediate the assembly of intracellular signaling complexes and link integrins to the actin cytoskeleton. For example, the β subunits of several integrins associate with the actin-binding protein α-actinin (Liu et al., 2000) (Section 3.3.10). Several integrin α- and β-subunits are expressed in the adult brain and present in neuronal synapses (Einheber et al., 1996; Pinkstaff et al., 1999; Schuster et al., 2001). Antibodies, disintegrins, and peptides that block integrin binding to their extracellular matrix ligands have been used to implicate integrin signaling in the stabilization of LTP (Bahr et al., 1997; Chun et al., 2001; Kramar et al., 2002; Staubli et al., 1990, 1998; Xiao et al., 1991) and in the functional maturation of hippocampal synapses (Chavis and Westbrook, 2001). Although neuronal synapses do not contain a basal lamina, integrin ligands such as laminin and reelin have been detected around dendritic spines and also in the synaptic cleft (Indyk et al., 2003; Pappas et al., 2001; Tian et al., 1997). By binding to extracellular matrix ligands within the synaptic cleft or at its borders, integrins localized on both sides of the synapse may participate in a form of trans-synaptic signaling (Einheber

et al., 1996). In addition, integrins may mediate intercellular adhesion at synapses by binding other cell surface proteins. For example, L1 and certain protocadherins contain in their extracellular domain an RGD (arginine–glycine–aspartate) motif, which is recognized by several integrins (Blaess et al., 1998; Kohmura et al., 1998; Shapiro and Colman, 1998).

Two of the integrin ligands have been found so far to affect dendritic spines. Laminin increases dendritic spine density in cultured Purkinje cell neurons (Seil, 1998) while its proteolytic degradation in the hippocampus impairs LTP maintenance (Nakagami et al., 2000). In addition, the large extracellular matrix glycoprotein reelin promotes dendritic spine morphogenesis and/or maintenance and enhances LTP in area CA1 of the hippocampus (Costa et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2001; Weeber et al., 2002). Reelin is secreted by various neuronal populations in the brain and binds to several transmembrane receptors on adjacent neurons, including the α₃β₁ integrin, apolipoprotein E, the very-low-density lipoprotein receptor, and the protocadherin-α family (Costa et al., 2001; Rice and Curran, 2001). In the reelin haploinsufficient heterozygous reeler mouse, which expresses half of the normal levels of reelin, dendritic spines are fewer, smaller, and have shorter necks (Liu et al., 2001). A possible model is that reelin surrounding dendritic spines activates integrin signaling pathways involving the cytoplasmic adaptor Dab1 to stimulate the local synthesis of proteins that regulate dendritic spine dynamics (Dong et al., 2003).

### 4.2.2. Syndecans

Syndecan 1 through 4 are family of transmembrane proteoglycans containing heparan sulfate chains attached to a protein core through O-linked glycosylation sites (Fig. 5) (Bandtlow and Zimmermann, 2000; Yamaguchi, 2002). Other families of proteoglycans contain chondroitin or dermatan sulfate chains and include either secreted proteoglycans, which are part of the extracellular matrix as described in the previous section, or proteoglycans attached to the cell surface through a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) linkage. Syndecans have been detected in the adult brain, where they are present in synapses and regulate synaptic plasticity (Bandtlow and Zimmermann, 2000; Lauri et al., 1999; Yamaguchi, 2002). The syndecan core proteins consist of structurally diverse extracellular domains and highly conserved transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. The extracellular domain carries several heparan sulfate chains, which bind a number of extracellular matrix molecules.

Syndecan-2 and syndecan-3 are the two members of the syndecan family predominantly expressed in the mature forebrain (Yamaguchi, 2002). Syndecan-3 and its ligand HB-GAM play a role in LTP, possibly through intracellular signaling pathways involving the tyrosine kinase Fyn and the scaffolding protein cortactin (Section 3.3.2) (Kaksonen et al., 2002; Kinnunen et al., 1998; Lauri et al., 1998, 1999; Pavlov et al., 2002). Syndecan-2 is the predominant syndecan enriched in dendritic spines of hippocampal neurons, and its synaptic localization correlates with the maturation of spines (Fig. 5) (Ethell and Yamaguchi, 1999; Hsueh et al., 1998). Overexpression of syndecan-2 in immature cultured hippocampal neurons induces early transformation of filopodial protrusions into mature mushroom-shaped spines, suggesting that this proteoglycan plays a role in dendritic spine morphogenesis (Ethell et al., 2001). The cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2 contains a carboxy terminal motif that can bind several PDZ domain-containing proteins, including syntenin, CASK, and synbindin (Cohen et al., 1998; Ethell et al., 2000; Grootjans et al., 1997; Hsueh et al., 1998). This PDZ domain-binding motif is required for the spine-inducing activity of syndecan-2. Phosphorylation of two tyrosines in the cytoplasmic domain of syndecan-2, which occurs downstream of EphB receptor tyrosine kinases (Section 4.1.2), is also important for the effects of syndecan-2 on dendritic spine morphogenesis (Ethell et al., 2001). Tyrosine phosphorylation mediates targeting to dendritic spines and clustering of syndecan-2. The syndecan-2 clusters provide sites of high heparan sulfate accumulation, which may modulate the spine-inducing activity of syndecan-2 through extracellular interactions with heparin-binding extracellular matrix molecules that are present in the synaptic cleft.

#### 4.3. Neuron-glia communication

Communication between glial cells and neurons plays a critical role in neurogenesis, synaptogenesis, neural transmission, and synaptic plasticity (Araque et al., 1999; Fields, 2004; Fields and Stevens-Graham, 2002; Haydon, 2001; Rusakov and Lehre, 2002; Song et al., 2002a, 2002b; Ullian et al., 2001; Ventura and Harris, 1999). Astrocytes are known to extend processes that envelop many synapses in the central nervous system, but the signals they exchange with neurons are not completely understood. The molecules involved in the reciprocal communication between glial cells and neurons include neurotransmitters and other soluble factors as well as cell adhesion molecules and other cell surface proteins that become engaged at the sites where the neuronal and glial cell surfaces come in close proximity. For example, neurotrophins secreted by astrocytes may contribute to the cross-talk between neurons and glia during synaptogenesis and synaptic plasticity (Alderson et al., 2000). Glial cells also secrete extracellular matrix molecules that interact with receptors located on dendritic spines (Seil, 1998) and contribute to the formation of perineuronal nets (Bruckner et al., 1993) (Section 4.2.2). Interestingly, the extracellular matrix glycoprotein thrombospondin, which is secreted by glial cells, seems to be an important factor in promoting synaptogenesis (Ullian et al., 2004). The α₃β₁ integrin has also been reported to play a special role in neuron-glia recognition. Dissociated embryonic cortical neurons and glial cells tend to form mixed aggregates when incubated together, unless they lack the α₃ integrin subunit
or the function of $\alpha_{3}\beta_{1}$ is blocked with antibodies (Anton et al., 1999). If $\alpha_{3}\beta_{1}$ is not functional, neurons preferentially aggregate with other neurons and glial cells with other glial cells. Whether these adhesive effects between neurons and glia are mediated through the interaction of $\alpha_{3}\beta_{1}$ with other transmembrane proteins or with secreted molecules associated with the surface of glial cells remains to be determined. However, it is interesting that $\beta_{1}$ integrin-mediated signals have been recently implicated in the stimulation of excitatory synaptogenesis that is triggered in cultured hippocampal neurons by local contact with astrocytes (Hama et al., 2004). Further demonstrating the ability of cell adhesion and recognition molecules on the surface of glial cells to influence synaptic function, transgenic mice ectopically expressing L1 in astrocytes exhibit a reduction in the magnitude of LTP (Luthi et al., 2001).

### 4.3.1. EphA receptors and ephrin-A ligands

Another form of contact-dependent neuron-glial communication involves the EphA subgroup of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases (Kullander and Klein, 2002; Murai and Pasquale, 2003; Wilkinson, 2001). Like the EphB receptors (discussed in Section 4.1.2), the EphA receptors cause morphological changes in dendritic spines when their kinase activity is stimulated by ephrin ligands (Murai et al., 2003). The ligands for the EphA receptors are the ephrin-A molecules, which are associated to the cell surface through a GPI-linkage. The EphA4 receptor, which is expressed on the dendritic spines of adult hippocampal pyramidal neurons, regulates dendritic spine morphology and organization by interacting with the ephrin-A3 ligand, which is expressed on the surface of astrocytes (Murai et al., 2003). The signaling activity of the EphA4 receptor, which can be stimulated by ephrin-A3, causes the retraction and even the collapse of dendritic spines in hippocampal slices. In contrast, inhibiting EphA4 signaling causes distortion and disorganization of the spines, suggesting that EphA4 kinase activity is required to maintain normal spine morphology. Indeed, EphA4 knockout mice have distorted spines in the hippocampus, confirming the importance of this receptor in vivo. This evidence suggests that ephrin-A3 and EphA4 mediate a form of repulsive communication between astrocytes and neurons that counteracts signals promoting the enlargement of spines. This may enable spine remodeling and synaptic plasticity while preserving the overall organization of neuronal circuits. Importantly, the communication may be bidirectional, with ephrin-A3 also initiating signals that affect the properties of astrocytes coming in contact with EphA4-positive dendrites. It will be interesting to determine whether the interplay between EphA4 and ephrin-A3 also plays a role in the transendocytosis of double-membrane invaginations containing juxtaposed synaptic and glial cell membranes (Spacek and Harris, 2004; Zimmer et al., 2003). Notably, the endocytic machinery of dendritic spines has been recently localized

to the extrasynaptic lateral regions of the spine (Racz et al., 2004). Internalization of these structures, called spinules, into astrocytic processes may represent a form of direct communication between thin dendritic spines and perisynaptic glia.

### 4.3.2. Cholesterol

Cholesterol is a component of lipid rafts and is required for the formation of dendritic spines and of functional presynaptic terminals (Hering et al., 2003; Mauch et al., 2001). It has been recently suggested that neurons do not produce sufficient cholesterol to support extensive synaptogenesis and that cholesterol produced by glial cells and released in complex with apolipoprotein-E regulates synapse formation and maintenance (Mauch et al., 2001; Pfrieger, 2003; Slezak and Pfrieger, 2003). Depletion of lipid rafts by interfering with the metabolic synthesis of cholesterol and sphingolipids in cultured hippocampal neurons leads to loss of dendritic spines and synapses, suggesting that lipid rafts are required for the assembly of proteins at the postsynaptic density (Hering et al., 2003). Indeed, glutamate receptors, ephrin-B molecules, and scaffolding proteins such as PSD-95 and GRIP, are found in lipid raft fractions from brain (Bruckner et al., 1999; Hering et al., 2003; Perez and Bredt, 1998; Suzuki et al., 2001). A number of cytoplasmic proteins in the postsynaptic density are palmitoylated and this lipid modification directs their localization to lipid rafts (El-Husseini and Bredt, 2002). Another important function of lipid rafts in dendritic spines may be to link the postsynaptic density to the actin cytoskeleton (Hering et al., 2003). Further work is needed to determine if the exchange of cholesterol is an important aspect of neuron-glial communication in vivo and if different populations of neurons have different requirements for glial-derived cholesterol.

## 5. Other morphogenetic proteins of dendritic spines

Besides the proteins involved in Rho signaling pathways and the actin-binding proteins discussed in Section 3, additional cytoplasmic proteins have been found to regulate dendritic spines downstream of cell surface receptors. These include enzymes that participate in signaling cascades and scaffolding proteins that orchestrate the assembly of the postsynaptic density and of other multiprotein complexes in the spine interior.

### 5.1. Scaffolding proteins of the postsynaptic density

The integrity of the postsynaptic density is important for normal spine morphology, in part because the actin filaments that shape dendritic spines are attached to it and in part because a number of proteins in the postsynaptic density regulate spine morphogenesis. Dispersal of postsynaptic density proteins by disruption of lipid rafts indeed causes thedisappearance of dendritic spines (Hering et al., 2003) (Section 4.3.2). Perturbing the function of scaffolding proteins in dendritic spines also affects spine morphology. Scaffolding proteins contribute to the clustering and stabilization of glutamate receptors and the other densely packed components of the postsynaptic density (Garner et al., 2000; Kim and Sheng, 2004). Many of the scaffolding proteins contain multiple PDZ domains that recognize short amino acid sequences at the carboxy terminus of other proteins. They also bind to each other, thus contributing to the formation of diverse multiprotein complexes.

PSD-95, a member of the membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) protein family, is a major constituent of the postsynaptic density (Cho et al., 1992). It binds the NR2 subunit of the NMDA receptor and interconnects the postsynaptic density with the actin cytoskeleton and intracellular Ca²⁺ stores. Interestingly, in cultured hippocampal neurons PSD-95 is recruited to new postsynaptic sites before NMDA receptors and may thus serve to anchor NMDA receptor clusters to an already assembled postsynaptic scaffold (Friedman et al., 2000; Rao et al., 1998). However, PSD-95 knockout mice do not show overt abnormalities in NMDA receptor localization and postsynaptic structure, suggesting a non-essential role of PSD-95 in the localization of NMDA receptors and possible compensatory roles of other PDZ domain-containing proteins (Migaud et al., 1998). Mice lacking the related PSD-93 protein also do not have structural or functional abnormalities in synapses of cerebellar Purkinje cells, where PSD-93 is expressed (McGee et al., 2001). However, lack of PSD-95 causes abnormalities in synaptic plasticity and learning and overexpression of PSD-95 increases the number of dendritic spines and promotes spine enlargement and AMPA receptor content (El-Husseini et al., 2000; Migaud et al., 1998). AMPA glutamate receptors may be recruited to PSD-95 through stargazin, a transmembrane protein with weak homology to the γ-1 subunit of the calcium channel (Chen et al., 2000; Schnell et al., 2002).

Through a chain of protein–protein interactions, PSD-95 also connects the NMDA receptors to cell surface metabotropic glutamate receptors and their downstream IP₃ receptors, which orchestrate Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores. PSD-95 binds the guanylate kinase-associated protein (GKAP), which in turn binds Shank, a family of scaffolding proteins (Naisbitt et al., 1999; Tu et al., 1999). The PSD95–GKAP complex regulates Shank stability and targeting to synapses (Romorini et al., 2004). Shank associates with Homer proteins (Naisbitt et al., 1999; Tu et al., 1999), which are another family of scaffolding proteins that interact with both the cell surface metabotropic glutamate receptors and the intracellular ryanodine and IP3 receptors (Xiao et al., 2000). As with PSD-95, overexpression of Shank and Homer accelerates the maturation of immature spines and promotes the enlargement of mature spines (Sala et al., 2001). Shank and Homer cooperate to promote the accumulation of IP₃ receptors and

postsynaptic density proteins in dendritic spines and an enhancement of presynaptic function. They may also affect the F-actin content of spines through Homer's interaction with the Rho GTPase-activating protein oligophrenin-1 (Govek et al., 2004) and through Shank's interaction with the actin-binding proteins cortactin (Naisbitt et al., 1999) and Abpl (Qualmann et al., 2004), the cytoskeletal protein fodrin (Bockers et al., 2001), the Rac1 and Cdc42 exchange factor βPIX (Park et al., 2003), and the Cdc42-binding protein IRSp53 (Bockers et al., 2001). The ability of Shank and Homer to promote spine morphogenesis depends on their ability to form a complex with each other and correlates with their accumulation in spines (Sala et al., 2001, 2003).

Interestingly, a naturally occurring short splice variant of Homer that lacks dimerization capacity (Homer 1a) is upregulated throughout a neuron following synaptic activity. Homer 1a disrupts the interaction between full-length Homer isoforms and Shank and inhibits synaptic targeting of both proteins (Sala et al., 2003). In addition, Homer 1a may interfere with intracellular Ca²⁺ responses mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors, which are coupled to IP₃ receptors through the full-length Homer isoforms. As could be expected, expression of Homer 1a destabilizes synapses and decreases dendritic spine numbers and dimensions. These activities may contribute to the global activity-dependent loss of spines in a neuron and the negative regulation of unstimulated synapses (Sala et al., 2003) (Section 4.1.1).

### 5.2. Cytoplasmic signaling proteins

Many signaling proteins are found in the postsynaptic density and regulate synaptic plasticity and dendritic spine morphology through interconnected pathways. For example, a number of protein kinases and phosphatases have been implicated in dendritic spine remodeling following LTP induction. Among them, CaMKII is a highly prevalent serine/threonine kinase in the postsynaptic density of glutamatergic synapses (Colbran and Brown, 2004; Kennedy, 2000). Activity-dependent activation of CaMKII is triggered by Ca²⁺ entry and is critical for LTP induction and experience-dependent plasticity (Lledo et al., 1995; Pettit et al., 1994). A number of CaMKII substrates have been identified in the postsynaptic density, including AMPA and NMDA receptors and scaffolding proteins of the PSD-95 family (Colbran and Brown, 2004; Mauceri et al., 2004; Shen et al., 1998; Yoshimura et al., 2000). Given its abundance, CaMKII may have structural in addition to enzymatic functions in dendritic spines. It binds to actin filaments and to a number of postsynaptic proteins and promotes the formation of dendritic filopodia and spines as well as synapses in hippocampal slice cultures (Jourdain et al., 2003; Pratt et al., 2003; Shen et al., 1998). The two major isoforms expressed in the brain are CaMKIIα and CaMKIIβ, which assemble in stochastic combinations into dodecameric heterooligomers. Only CaMKIIβ binds toF-actin and localizes CaMKIIα/β heterooligomers to dendritic spines. NMDA receptor-dependent Ca²⁺ fluxes cause the reversible translocation of CaMKII from F-actin to the postsynaptic density, where binding to the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor prolongs CaMKII kinase activity (Bayer et al., 2001; Shen and Meyer, 1999; Shen et al., 2000). On the other hand, CaMKII inhibitors block both LTP induction and the activity-dependent formation of dendritic filopodia and spines, suggesting that CaMKII contributes to the structural plasticity induced by synaptic activity (Jourdain et al., 2003). Remarkably, CaMKII may also contribute to the stabilization of activated synapses while at the same time destabilizing inactive synaptic partners (Pratt et al., 2003) (Section 4.1.1). Concomitant activation of CaMKII and NMDA receptors has been shown to enhance synaptic contacts, whereas CaMKII activation without NMDA receptor activation destabilizes synaptic contacts (Pratt et al., 2003).

Another protein kinase that is abundant in the brain and localized in dendritic spines is protein kinase C (PKC) (Kose et al., 1990). PKC has long been associated with synaptic modifications underlying learning and memory (Chen et al., 1997). More recent data show that activation of PKC in mature cultured hippocampal neurons is involved in the formation of dendritic spines associated with synaptic plasticity, and in particular those with a large head (Goldin and Segal, 2003). Activation of PKC by treatment with phorbol esters also leads to the formation of new spines with large heads (Goldin and Segal, 2003) and induces the accumulation of CaMKII and filamentous actin in dendritic spines but the dispersal of synaptic NMDA receptors away from synaptic sites (Fong et al., 2002). Interestingly, PKC activation downstream of β1 integrin engaged at localized sites of neuron-glia contact mediates a global enhancement of synaptogenesis in immature cultured hippocampal neurons (Section 4.3) (Hama et al., 2004).

The mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases, Erk1 and Erk2, are serine/threonine kinases that have also been shown to play a role in the formation of new dendritic protrusions in hippocampal neurons and their stabilization following neural activity (Goldin and Segal, 2003; Wu et al., 2001). Spaced depolarizing pulses generate prolonged MAP kinase activation and lead to MAP kinase-dependent formation of dendritic protrusions in hippocampal neurons. An initial phase of MAP kinase activation, which is dependent on Ca²⁺ influx through L-type voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels and CaMKII signaling, does not cause morphological changes. However, prolonged activation of MAP kinases, which requires activation of the cyclic AMP-dependent PKA, is responsible for the extension of new protrusions.

PKC-induced formation of dendritic spines also involves Erk activation (Goldin and Segal, 2003). In addition, many of the cell surface receptors that regulate dendritic spine morphology described in Section 4 positively or negatively regulate MAP kinases. For example, Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptors activated during the onset of LTP causes

activation of the small GTPase Ras, which in turn activates Erk1 and Erk2 through a cascade of other intermediate MAP kinases (Sweatt, 2001, 2004; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). Ca²⁺ promotes Ras activation by several mechanisms (Cullen and Lockyer, 2002; Sweatt, 2001; Thomas and Huganir, 2004). For example, Ca²⁺ positively regulates RasGRF, a Ras exchange factor that is highly expressed in the postsynaptic density and binds to the NR2B subunit of the NMDA receptor (Krapivinsky et al., 2003). In addition, Ca²⁺ negatively regulates SynGAP, a Ras GTPase activating protein that is abundant in the postsynaptic density, binds PSD-95, and is inhibited by CaMKII phosphorylation (Chen et al., 1998). This CaMKII–Ras–MAP kinase pathway promotes insertions of AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic site and is required for LTP (Zhu et al., 2002). Furthermore, SynGAP null hippocampal neurons in culture form longer spines than wild-type neurons, with a faster time course (Vazquez et al., 2004). Neurofibromin is another GTPase activating protein for Ras that is highly expressed in the brain and whose mutations have been associated with mental retardation and learning deficits (Costa et al., 2002; Weeber and Sweatt, 2002). Therefore, neurofibromin could contribute to the regulation of the Ras–MAP kinase pathway in dendritic spines.

Another pathway required for LTD involves activation of the Ras family GTPase, Rap1, and its downstream p38MAP kinase and leads to removal of AMPA receptors from the postsynaptic density (Zhu et al., 2002). Two Rap1 GTPase activating proteins that could regulate Rap1 activity in the postsynaptic density are SPAR, which binds to actin filaments (Section 3.3.8) (Pak et al., 2001), and SPAL, which binds to PSD-95 (Roy et al., 2002). Positive regulation may be provided by Rap exchange factors expressed in the brain and regulated by Ca²⁺ and diacylglycerol or cAMP (Bos et al., 2001). The Trk receptors and other families of receptor tyrosine kinases (Section 4.1.6) also activate the MAP kinases, while the Eph receptors (Section 4.1.2) have been shown to inhibit MAP kinase activation in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons (Gottschalk et al., 1998; Grunwald et al., 2001; Pozzo-Miller et al., 1999; Sweatt, 2004). Thus, MAP kinases can integrate many diverse cellular responses in dendritic spines leading to changes in synaptic plasticity and remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton.

The Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, which in the brain includes Src, Fyn, Yes, Lck, and Lyn, has also been implicated in the regulation of learning and memory. Src family kinases are present in dendritic spines and modulate NMDA receptor function (Boxall and Lancaster, 1998; Salter and Kalia, 2004). Phosphorylation of the NMDA receptor by Src family kinases plays a role in the induction of LTP (Rostas et al., 1996), suggesting that Src kinases could be involved in the LTP-induced formation of new spines. Another family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that has been implicated in synaptic plasticity is the Abl family, including Abl and Arg (Moresco and Koleske, 2003; Moresco et al., 2003). Abl family kinases are present in the
postsynaptic density, bind to actin filaments, and regulate the organization of the actin cytoskeleton in non-neuronal cells. It will therefore be interesting to examine the spine morphogenetic effects of the tyrosine kinases of the Src and Abl families.

## 6. Neuropathologies associated with abnormalities in dendritic spines

Given the importance of dendritic spines in excitatory synaptic physiology, it is not surprising that abnormalities in dendritic spines have been associated with synaptic dysfunction and pronounced deficits in cognitive function. As we have discussed in the previous sections, perturbation of a variety of different molecules results in dendritic spine abnormalities. Therefore, it would be expected that a variety of different gene mutations affect dendritic spine function. Indeed, dendritic spines are irregularly shaped and have abnormal densities in a number of neurodevelopmental disorders characterized by mental retardation, such as nonspecific X-linked mental retardation, Fragile X syndrome, William’s syndrome, Rett syndrome, Down’s syndrome, Angelman syndrome, and autism (Barnes and Milgram, 2002; Ferrer and Gullotta, 1990; Fiala et al., 2002b; Irwin et al., 2000; Kaufmann and Moser, 2000; Rudelli et al., 1985).

Fragile X syndrome is another X-linked mental retardation disorder caused by mutation of a single gene: FMR1 (O’Donnell and Warren, 2002; Willemsen et al., 2004; Zalfa and Bagni, 2004). In most cases, amplification of CGC repeats in the 5′ region of the FMR1 gene leads to its silencing and the absence of the FMR1 protein. Individuals affected by Fragile X syndrome exhibit abnormally long and thin dendritic spines with immature morphological features and increased densities (Hinton et al., 1991; Irwin et al., 2000, 2001; Kaufmann and Moser, 2000; Rudelli et al., 1985). FMR1 knockout mice show similar (but transient) dendritic spine abnormalities during brain development, confirming the link between the FMR1 mutation and the spine phenotype (Comery et al., 1997; Irwin et al., 2000; Nimchinsky et al., 2001). The FMR1 gene product is an mRNA-binding protein associated with polyribosomes and located at synapses. Due to its ability to localize mRNAs to specific sites within the cell and regulate protein translation (Khandjian, 1999; Zhang et al., 2001), the FMR1 protein has been proposed to regulate translation of key postsynaptic molecules in dendritic spines (Feng et al., 1997; Greenough et al., 2001; Weiler et al., 1997; Willemsen et al., 2004; Zalfa and Bagni, 2004). Interestingly, recent data have linked FMR1 to Rac1 signaling pathways (Kobayashi et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2003; Schenck et al., 2001, 2003).

Other X-linked mutations associated with mental retardation that could affect the function of proteins in synapses and dendritic spines are mutations in the cell adhesion molecule L1 (Section 4.1.5) (Rosenthal et al., 1992) and in a β1 integrin-associated tetraspanin gene (Section 4.2.1) (Kopczynski et al., 1996; Maecker et al., 1997; Rohrbough et al., 2000; Zemni et al., 2000). In other cases of mental retardation, such as Rett syndrome and Angelman syndrome, the mutated gene has been identified but it remains unclear how the dendritic spine abnormalities arise (Amir et al., 1999; Clayton-Smith and Laan, 2003). However, a mouse model for Angelman syndrome—generated by a maternal null mutation in the Ube3a ubiquitin ligase gene—implicates misregulation of CaMKII localization and function in the disease (Weeber et al., 2003). In yet other cases, such as Down’s syndrome, the chromosomal region mutated is known but it comprises many genes and the gene(s) directly responsible for mental retardation and the reduction in the number of dendritic spines have not been conclusively identified (Ferrer and Gullotta, 1990).

Remarkably, several genes that are mutated in families with mental retardation encode components of Rho family signaling pathways, which underlies the importance of these GTPases in regulating dendritic spine morphology and function (Section 3.1) (Ramakers, 2002). X-linked mutated genes include the Rac1 and Cdc42 exchange factor αPIX (which is closely related to βPIX and is also known as ArhGEF6 and Cool-2) (Govek et al., 2004; Kutsche et al., 2000), the Cdc42 exchange factor faciogenital dysplasia gene 1 (FDG1), which has been linked to Aarskog–Scott syndrome (Pasteris et al., 1994; Zheng et al., 1996), the RhoA GTPase activating protein oligophrenin-1 (Billuart et al., 1998), and the Rac1 and Cdc42 downstream effector Pak3 (Allen et al., 1998). In addition, mutations of the Rho family downstream effector LIM kinase 1 on chromosome 7q11 have been linked to William’s syndrome, a mental disorder also characterized by dendritic spines with abnormal morphology (Bamburg, 1999; Bellugi et al., 1999; Frangiskakis et al., 1996; Kaufmann and Moser, 2000). Finally, haploinsufficiency of a novel Rac1 and Cdc42 GTPase-activating protein gene on chromosome 3p25 has been linked to severe mental retardation (Endris et al., 2002). The abnormal function of the mutated proteins is likely to contribute to mental retardation by causing abnormalities in the neuronal actin cytoskeleton, including dendritic spine dysgenesis (Fiala et al., 2002b; Govek et al., 2004; Meng et al., 2002; Ramakers, 2002). Probably mutations in other Rho family regulatory genes will be linked to mental retardation and dendritic spine abnormalities.

The wide phenotypic variability of autism likely reflects the involvement of multiple genes as well as the effects of epigenetic factors and environmental modifiers. However, autism is more prevalent in males than females, suggesting that some susceptibility loci for autism may be X-linked and perhaps involve some of the same genes that give rise to X-linked mental retardation syndromes (Castermans et al., 2004; Smalley et al., 1988). Indeed, autism can be associated with Fragile X syndrome, but this accounts for only a small minority of the cases of autism. Interestingly, point
mutations in the neuroligin 3 and neuroligin 4 synaptic adhesion molecules (Section 4.1.3), which are X-linked genes, have been recently associated with autism-spectrum disorders and mental retardation (Jamain et al., 2003; Laumonnier et al., 2004). Consistent with a causative role in mental retardation, in cultured hippocampal neurons the disease-associated mutations impair the synapse-promoting activity of the two neuroligins (Chih et al., 2004a). Neuroligin 1 also maps to a locus (3q26) that has been associated with autism, but mutations of this neuroligin remain to be identified in autistic patients (Chih et al., 2004b).

Abnormal dendritic spines are associated with a number of other neurological conditions, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder with psychosis, and epilepsy (Garey et al., 1998; Glantz and Lewis, 2000; Rosoklija et al., 2000). Abnormally low levels of the extracellular matrix protein reelin (Section 4.2.1) have been detected in postmortem brains of schizophrenia patients and mice with reelin haploinsufficiency replicate dendritic spine deficiencies and other brain abnormalities observed in schizophrenic patients, supporting the notion that mutations in the reelin gene may be involved in schizophrenia (Costa et al., 2001). Dendritic spine degeneration has been observed in the hippocampus of epileptic patients and in animal models of epilepsy (Isokawa, 1996, 1998; Jiang et al., 1998; Olney et al., 1983; Phelps et al., 1991). Significant loss of dendritic spines occurs as a direct outcome of an initial acute epileptic insult, which produces elevation of extracellular glutamate and triggers excitotoxic events. In addition, chronic changes in the morphology and density of dendrites and dendritic spines persist long after the initial insult.

The number of neuropathologies known to be associated with changes in dendritic spine morphology and density continues to grow, but in some cases the effects may be indirect or reflect a general neuronal pathology. For example, fetal alcohol syndrome and malnutrition are known to cause dendritic spine abnormalities (Fiala et al., 2002b). Indeed, the presence of normally shaped spines is a good indicator of the health of a neuron. Furthermore, dendritic spines are extremely sensitive to outside stimuli and many normal physiological conditions, such as hibernation and hormonal changes during the estrous cycle, also cause changes in dendritic spines (Fiala et al., 2002b; Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2001). Interestingly, clinically used inhalational anesthetics block dendritic spine motility (Kaech et al., 1999), raising the interesting possibility that the effects of these anesthetics on dendritic spines contribute to their mechanism of action.

incomplete. In addition, the molecular composition of dendritic spines is different in pyramidal neurons and Purkinje cells. The activity of the molecular components of the spines is regulated by external stimuli that induce protein conformational changes, phosphorylation, proteolysis, and protein relocation within a spine. Furthermore, the molecular composition of a given spine is not constant over time but changes in response to neural activity and other triggers. Rapid changes can occur through protein relocation between spines and dendritic shaft. This is probably a wider phenomenon than currently recognized and additional proteins that shuttle to and from dendritic spines in response to synaptic activity likely remain to be identified. It will also be interesting to further investigate the mechanisms of targeting and removal of specific proteins from spines. Changes in spine molecular composition can also occur through regulation of mRNA localization and stability in conjunction with local protein synthesis within the spines or in their vicinity (Martin and Kosik, 2002).

Proteomics and bioinformatics approaches will be needed to comprehensively identify the molecular components of dendritic spines and model their organization into networks. A challenge for the future is to dissect the interrelationships between individual molecules and establish how they are modified in response to different types of stimuli. The ultimate goal will be to model the molecular machinery operating in dendritic spines accurately enough to predict the outcome of specific perturbations. For example, it will be important to determine whether rearrangements and endocytosis of cell surface receptors play a role in the small irregular movements occurring during spine morphing as well as the more prominent movements underlying changes in spine dimensions, and identify the actin-regulatory proteins that are essential for these different types of spine movements. Dendritic spines are indeed emerging as an excellent model to study the molecular pathways involved in actin-based cytoskeletal reorganization and motility. This knowledge will also be useful to guide efforts to interfere with dendritic spine abnormalities and improve cognitive function in individuals affected by mental disabilities.

Systematic proteomics approaches have identified a very large collection of signaling and structural molecules that are present in dendritic spines (Husi et al., 2000; Peng et al., 2004; Walikonis et al., 2000). However, this list remains
