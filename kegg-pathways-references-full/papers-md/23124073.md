The role of the IAP E3 ubiquitin ligases in regulating pattern-recognition receptor signalling

**Peter Vandenabeele**${}^{1,2}$ **and Mathieu J. M. Bertrand**${}^{1,2}$

Abstract | An inflammatory response is initiated when innate immune pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) expressed by different cell types detect constituents of invading microorganisms and endogenous intracellular molecules released by dying cells. The intracellular cascades activated by PRRs induce the expression and maturation of inflammatory molecules that coordinate the removal of the infectious agents and of the infected or damaged cells. In this Review, we discuss the findings implicating members of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) family in the ubiquitylation-dependent regulation of PRR signalling. Understanding the role of IAPs in innate immunity may open new therapeutic perspectives for the treatment of PRR-dependent inflammatory diseases.

The selective sensing of danger signals by the innate immune system is achieved through the expression of an array of germline-encoded pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs) by haematopoietic cells (including macrophages, dendritic cells and neutrophils) and non-haematopoietic cells (such as epithelial cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts)${}^{1-3}$. PRRs detect the presence of conserved microbial components, called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and endogenous intracellular molecules that are modified, released or exposed by dying cells, called danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs). PRRs have been classified into different families according to their subcellular localization, molecular structure and ligand repertoire. The membrane-bound Toll-like receptors (TLRs), interleukin-1 receptors (IL-1Rs) and C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) survey the extracellular environment and the endosomal compartments, whereas the cytosolic NOD-like receptors (NLRs), the RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs) and the DNA sensors DNA-dependent activator of IRFs (DAI; also known as DLM1 and ZBP1) and absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) function as intracellular sentinels${}^{1-3}$.

The functional outcome of PRR activation varies depending on the receptor, the responding cell and the nature of the stimulating PAMP or DAMP. For many PRRs, sensing the respective agonist induces activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling pathways, which drive transcriptional upregulation of genes encoding pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as antimicrobial proteins${}^{1,4,5}$. Signal transduction from those PRRs can also activate transcription factors of the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family, which are responsible for the type I interferon (IFN)-dependent antiviral responses. Other PRRs, such as some members of the NLR family, do not regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines at the transcriptional level but instead lead to the assembly of caspase 1-activating platforms, called inflammasomes, which are responsible for the proteolytic maturation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 (REFS 2,3). The pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines induced by these pathways regulate the permeability of the vascular endothelium, the recruitment to the endangered area of immune-regulatory blood cells and the eventual death of the inflammatory cells, such as neutrophils.

Recent studies have revealed crucial roles for ubiquitylation cascades in the regulation of the innate immune responses activated downstream of PRR activation${}^{4,6}$. Ubiquitylation is a post-translational modification of proteins involving the covalent attachment of ubiquitin, a 76-amino-acid polypeptide, to a target protein by a three-step enzymatic reaction catalysed by three types of proteins: a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), a ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2) and a ubiquitin ligase (E3)${}^{7}$ (FIG. 1). Ubiquitylation can result in the conjugation of one ubiquitin molecule to the substrate (monoubiquitylation) or in the addition of one of eight possible ubiquitin chains (polyubiquitylation). The type of ubiquitylation determines its effect through the recruitment

downstream of various members of the TNFR family²⁰⁻²⁴ (FIG. 2b). Third, and more recently characterized, they function as direct regulators of signal transduction downstream of several PRRs²⁵⁻²⁹ (FIG. 2c). Finally, very recent studies have reported their contribution to pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 maturation by regulating inflammasome activation³⁰,³¹ (FIG. 2d).

This Review focuses on the recent findings implicating the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of *Drosophila* IAP2 (DIAP2) in the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway, and of mammalian XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 in the regulation of nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) and NOD2, TLR2 and TLR4 and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) signalling pathways and in inflammasome activation. The other aspects of IAP functions in cell death regulation and TNFR signalling have recently been reviewed elsewhere¹⁰,¹¹,³²,³³. This Review also tackles the problem of understanding the precise regulatory function of IAPs in PRR signalling for the potential use of IAP antagonists as a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of PRR-dependent inflammatory diseases.

## The domain architecture of IAPs

The IAP family consists of genetically conserved proteins, and its first member was identified in baculovirus as a protein contributing to efficient viral replication by inhibiting the apoptotic machinery of the infected insect host cells³⁴. Since then, IAP homologues have been identified in various organisms, including insects and vertebrates. The defining structural characteristic of IAPs is the presence of one to three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) motifs in their amino-terminal portion, which are zinc-binding structures of approximately 70 amino acid residues that mediate protein–protein interactions (FIG. 2e).

The human genome encodes eight different IAPs (NAIP (also known as BIRC1), cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, SURVIVIN (also known as BIRC5), BRUCE (also known as BIRC6), ML-IAP (also known as BIRC7) and ILP2 (also known as BIRC8)). XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 are potent inhibitors of cell death and harbour three BIR domains. The BIR2 and BIR3 domains of XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 contain a deep peptide-binding groove that can interact with N-terminal tetrapeptides, called IAP-binding motifs (IBMs)¹¹. Notably, IBMs are found in activated pro-apoptotic caspases as well as in mature endogenous IAP antagonists, such as OMI (also known as HTRA2) and SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; also known as DIABLO).

Unexpectedly, XIAP has recently been reported to be the only IAP capable of direct inhibition of the proteolytic activity of caspases³⁵,³⁶. The anti-apoptotic potential of cIAP1 and cIAP2 was shown to depend on their E3 ubiquitin ligase activities¹⁸⁻²⁰,³⁷. The E3 ligase activity of XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 is exerted by the presence of a carboxy-terminal RING domain¹². These IAPs also contain a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, allowing them to interact with polyubiquitylated proteins³⁸,³⁹. Finally, cIAP1 and cIAP2 carry an additional caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), which was recently reported, in the case of cIAP1, to contribute to the

OMI  
(Also known as HTRA2). An endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist released from the intermembrane space of the mitochondria during apoptosis. It binds to X-linked IAP (XIAP), cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2 via an N-terminal tetrapeptide IAP-binding motif (IBM) and induces the proteolytic inactivation of IAPs, as well as of receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), leading to increased caspase activation.

SMAC  
(Second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase; also known as DIABLO). An endogenous inhibitor of apoptosis protein (IAP) antagonist released from the intermembrane mitochondrial space following a wide range of death stimuli. Its cleavage releases an N-terminal tetrapeptide IAP-binding motif (IBM), allowing it to bind and inhibit X-linked IAP (XIAP), cellular IAP1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2, causing an increase in the activation of caspases.

regulation of its E3 ubiquitin ligase activity by mediating intramolecular inhibition 40. Most of the recently characterized roles of XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 can be attributed to the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of their RING domains. IAP-mediated ubiquitylation has a central role in the regulation of the innate immune response emerging from several PRRs. Importantly, the BIR1–BIR2–BIR3–UBA–RING domain architecture of mammalian XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 is phylogenetically and functionally conserved in the fly DIAP2 (FIG. 2e), studies of which provided the first hint of the role of IAPs in PRR signalling, as discussed in the next section.

Role of DIAP2 in the fly IMD signalling pathway

The first evidence for a role of an IAP in PRR-mediated innate immune responses emerged from studies in *Drosophila melanogaster*. In contrast to vertebrates, flies do not have an adaptive immune system, and therefore entirely rely on their innate immune responses to combat microbial challenges. Immunity against Gram-negative bacteria is provided by peptidoglycan recognition protein receptor-LC (PGRP-LC) and PGRP-LE, two PRRs that sense the bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan (PGN) constituent diaminopimelic acid (DAP) and activate MAPK and NF-κB signalling pathways, leading to antimicrobial peptide production 41,42 (FIG. 3).

The PGRP-LC pathway, also known as the IMD pathway, resembles the mammalian TNFR1 pathway. Flies express two RING-containing IAPs, DIAP1 and DIAP2, and the requirement of DIAP2 for innate immunity against Gram-negative bacteria is now supported both *in vitro* and *in vivo* 43–49. Upon sensing its agonist, PGRP-LC oligomerizes and induces recruitment of IMD, which is an adaptor protein that is similar to the mammalian receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1; also known as RIP1), but it lacks a kinase domain 50,51.

IMD subsequently recruits FAS-associated death domain-containing protein (FADD; also known as BG4), which in turn binds Death related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein (DREDD), the fly orthologue of caspase 8 (REFS 52–54). DIAP2 then associates its BIR2 and BIR3 domains with the death effector domain (DED) of DREDD and promotes DREDD activation by conjugating it with K63-linked ubiquitin chains 49. Activated DREDD next cleaves IMD at its N terminus, and this cleavage reveals an IBM motif on IMD that associates with the BIR2 and BIR3 domains of DIAP2 (REFS 48,55). Together with Effete and UEV1A–Bendless, which are the fly E2 orthologues of the mammalian UBC5 (also known as UBE2D2) and UEV1A–UBC13 (also known as UBE2N), respectively, DIAP2 then targets cleaved IMD for K63-linked polyubiquitylation 48,56. The ubiquitin chains added onto IMD, and potentially onto DREDD or other proteins within the complex, serve as signalling platforms for the recruitment and activation of the *Drosophila* MAPK complex TAK1–TAB2 (TGFβ-activated kinase 1–TAK1-binding protein 2) and of the Immune response deficient 5 (IRD5)–Kenny complex (with IRD5 and Kenny being orthologues of the IKKβ and NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) components of the mammalian IkB kinase (IKK) complex) 46,57–62.

Figure 2 | IAPs in the regulation of the innate immune response. **a** | X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2 regulate the innate immune response at many levels. First, by acting as inhibitors of cell death (apoptotic and necroptotic) downstream of tumour necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) family members, as well as in other death pathways, they limit the potential release and exposition of danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) by the dying cells. XIAP interferes with the proteolytic activities of caspase 3, caspase 7 and caspase 9, whereas cIAP1 and cIAP2 regulate cell death in part by binding and ubiquitylating caspase 3, caspase 7 and receptor interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1). **b** | Second, they control mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling pathways downstream of various TNFR family members — cIAP1 and cIAP2 positively regulate the canonical NF-κB pathway but function as negative regulators for the non-canonical NF-κB pathway. **c** | Third, and more recently characterized, they regulate the signalling pathways activated downstream of several pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), such as Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4, nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) and NOD2, and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). **d** | Finally, they contribute to pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 maturation by regulating inflammasome activity. **e** | IAPs form a family of genetically conserved proteins. The domain architectures of mammalian XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 and of *Drosophila melanogaster* DIAP2 are depicted schematically. The defining structure of IAPs is the presence of one to three baculovirus IAP repeat (BIR) domains that enable protein–protein interactions. In addition, XIAP, cIAP1, cIAP2 and DIAP2 possess a RING domain that provides them with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. These IAPs also contain a ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain, allowing them to interact with ubiquitin (Ub) chains. Finally, cIAP1 and cIAP2 harbour a caspase-recruitment domain (CARD), which is reported to regulate their enzymatic E3 activities.

Figure 3 | Model of DIAP2-dependent regulation of the IMD pathway. The addition of lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains to Death related ced-3/Nedd2-like protein (DREDD) by Drosophila inhibitor of apoptosis protein 2 (DIAP2) activates its proteolytic activity (indicated by a red star) and results in DREDD-mediated cleavage of immune deficiency protein (IMD), which reveals an IAP-binding motif (IBM) at the neo-amino terminus of cleaved IMD. DIAP2 then associates and K63-ubiquitylates cleaved IMD. These ubiquitin chains serve as scaffolds for the recruitment and activation of the TAK1-binding protein 2–TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAB2 –TAK1) complex and of the Kenny–Immune response deficient 5 (IRD5)–Relish complex. Activated TAK1 phosphorylates MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7 and IRD5, resulting in the respective subsequent phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and Relish. DREDD-mediated cleavage of phosphorylated Relish then allows translocation of its phosphorylated DNA-binding portion to the nucleus, where it induces expression of antimicrobial genes. JNK activates the transcription factor AP1, which drives expression of another set of immune genes. AP1, activator protein 1; DAP-PGN, diaminopimelic acid containing peptidoglycan; FADD, FAS-associated death domain-containing protein; PGRP-LC, peptidoglycan recognition protein receptor-LC.

By analogy with their mammalian orthologues, it is believed that TAB2 and Kenny function as ubiquitin receptors to recruit the two kinase complexes to the K63-linked ubiquitin chains^{63,64}. Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates and activates MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4), MKK7 and IRD5–Kenny^{58,65}; subsequently, activation of MKK4 and MKK7 leads to the phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), and activation of IRD5–Kenny leads to the phosphorylation of the NF-κB family member Relish.

Relish is a dual domain protein that contains both a DNA-binding domain (the Rel homology domain) and an inhibitor of NF-κB (IkB)-like domain with six ankyrin repeats. In addition to IRD5–Kenny-mediated phosphorylation, activation of Relish further requires DREDD-mediated proteolytic removal of the inhibitory domain, which then allows translocation of the DNA-binding portion to the nucleus, where it induces expression of antimicrobial genes^{60,66–68}. As mentioned above, DIAP2-mediated K63-linked ubiquitylation of DREDD and IMD has a crucial role in the activation of the pathway. To ensure a transient immune response, negative regulatory mechanisms must exist. This is in part provided by ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase 36 (USP36) and CYLD, two DUBs that dismantle the ubiquitin chains and thereby limit the strength and duration of the immune response^{69,70}.

The pioneering work implicating DIAP2 in the IMD pathway paved the way for similar findings in mammals. Regulatory functions of mammalian IAPs (mouse and human) in PRR signalling were later chronologically identified downstream of NOD1 and NOD2, TLR2 and TLR4, RIG-I and finally at the level of the inflammasome.

### Role of IAPs in NOD1 and NOD2 signalling

NOD1 and NOD2 are mammalian cytosolic PGN-sensing PRRs of the NLR family that provide immune defences against intracellular bacterial infection^{3,5}. Interestingly, the signalling events downstream of NOD1 and NOD2 share similarities with the fly IMD pathway and with the mammalian TNFR1 pathway, and recent studies have provided *in vitro* and *in vivo* evidence for non-redundant roles of cIAP1, cIAP2 and XIAP in controlling NOD1 and NOD2-mediated immunity^{25–27,71}. Macrophages derived from mice deficient in cIAP1 (REF. 72), cIAP2 (REF. 73) or XIAP^{74} and human colonocytes in which cIAP1 or cIAP2 have been silenced by RNA interference fail to activate NF-κB and MAPKs and display sharp attenuation in cytokine induction following NOD1 and NOD2 stimulation^{25–27}. This blunted response is also observed *in vivo* when cIAP1-, cIAP2- or XIAP-deficient mice are challenged with the purified NOD agonists, or when XIAP-null mice are infected with the intracellular bacterium *Listeria monocytogenes*^{25,26,71}.

Figure 4 | Model of IAP-dependent regulation of NOD1 and NOD2 immunity. Following stimulation, receptor interacting protein kinase 2 (RIPK2) associates with nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain-containing protein 1 (NOD1) and NOD2 and recruits X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2 to the receptor-signalling complex. Each of the recruited IAPs then conjugates RIPK2 with ubiquitin (Ub) chains. cIAP1 and cIAP2 directly mediate lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitylation of RIPK2, but the type of ubiquitin chains conjugated to RIPK2 by XIAP remains to be determined. The addition of these ubiquitin chains facilitates binding and activation of the TAK1-binding protein 2 (TAB2)--TAB3--TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complex. The recruitment of the IκB kinase (IKK) complex (IKKα--IKKβ--NF-κB essential modifier (NEMO)) to RIPK2 occurs independently of RIPK2 K209 ubiquitylation. Activated TAK1 then phosphorylates IKKβ and the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38 and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK). The E3 activity of XIAP is also required for the recruitment of the E3 complex linear chain ubiquitin assembly complex (LUBAC), the enzymatic activity of which facilitates activation of the IKK complex. Activated IKKβ phosphorylates inhibitor of NF-κB-α (IκBa), a signal for its K48 ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. This permits translocation of the nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) dimer p65--p50 into the nucleus, where it transactivates pro-inflammatory genes. AP1, activator protein 1; TRAF, TNFR-associated factor.

Whereas cIAP1 and cIAP2 directly conjugate RIPK2 with K63-linked ubiquitin chains, XIAP promotes, directly or indirectly, another, still undefined type of ubiquitylation of RIPK2 (REFS 25,26,81). The addition of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to K209 of RIPK2 facilitates binding of the TAB2 and TAB3 adaptor proteins and allows recruitment and activation of TAK1 (REF. 78), which in turn phosphorylates IKKβ and the MAPKs p38 and JNK82. Activation of the TAB2--TAB3--TAK1 subcomplex might, however, not be restricted to the conjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to RIPK2, as XIAP-deficient cells also have a defect in MAPK activation26. In contrast to the JNK and NF-κB pathways, regulation of p38 activation downstream of NOD1 and NOD2 involves CARD9 and MKK4 (REF. 83), and is differentially regulated by cIAP1 and cIAP2 in human colonocytes25.

The mechanism by which the IKK complex (IKKα--IKKβ--NEMO) is recruited to the RIPK2 signalling platform is not fully understood, but it is reported to occur independently of RIPK2 ubiquitylation at K209 (REF. 78). Interestingly, the E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of XIAP is involved in the recruitment of linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC)26, a tripartite E3 ubiquitin ligase complex that mediates linear ubiquitylation84. The enzymatic activity of LUBAC is required for NOD2-induced NF-κB activation26, potentially by generating linear ubiquitin chains that facilitate recruitment and full activation of the IKK complex85–87. Once activated, IKKβ phosphorylates IκBa, thereby marking it as a substrate for K48-linked ubiquitylation and subsequent proteasomal degradation. The release of the inhibitory effect of IκBa then permits the NF-κB p65--p50 dimers to translocate into the nucleus and transactivate pro-inflammatory genes. NF-κB-mediated induction of A20, a DUB that represses RIPK2 poly-ubiquitylation, serves as a negative feedback mechanism to limit the amplitude and duration of the response78,79.

Together, studies in the fly IMD pathway and in the mammalian NOD1 and NOD2 pathways have identified a conserved regulatory function of IAPs in the innate immune response to bacterial PGN that consists, at least in part, of the ubiquitylation of RIPK-like proteins. This conserved function of IAPs goes beyond these PRR signalling pathways, as cIAP1 and cIAP2 also regulate TNFR1-mediated responses by modulating the RIPK1 ubiquitylation status11. Intriguingly, the recruitment of LUBAC to the TNFR1 signalling complex was shown to rely on the E3 ligase activity of cIAP1 and cIAP2, whereas in the NOD2 signalling pathway the RING domain of XIAP, but not of cIAP1 or cIAP2, was reported to mediate this function26,88,89. However, the molecular explanation for the differential recruitment of LUBAC to these two signalling complexes is not yet understood. So far, linear ubiquitylation has not been reported in the fly IMD pathway, which may correlate with the absence of true orthologues of the LUBAC complex components in the *D. melanogaster* genome. Although a role for DIAP2 in the other arm of the fly innate immune response — the Toll signalling pathway — has been excluded44,45,47, later studies demonstrated ubiquitylation-dependent regulatory functions of cIAP1 and cIAP2 downstream of mammalian TLRs28.

NOD1 binds DAP, whereas NOD2 detects the PGN derivative muramyldipeptide (MDP). Following stimulation, both sensors oligomerize and recruit the adaptor and effector protein RIPK2 (also known as RIP2), another member of the RIPK family (FIG. 4). cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP and TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), TRAF5 or TRAF6 are then recruited to the complex25–27,75–78. Each of the recruited IAPs contributes to the polyubiquitylation of RIPK2, which is a crucial step for the downstream activation of the pathway25,26,78–80. However, in some cell lines, XIAP seems to be the main IAP acting as an E3 ubiquitin ligase for RIPK2, as depletion of cIAP1 and cIAP2 by the use of the SMAC mimetic LBW242 apparently does not affect RIPK2 polyubiquitylation in these cells26. The identity of the TRAF proteins recruited to the complex, and whether they also act as direct E3s for RIPK2 or only as adaptor proteins facilitating IAP recruitment, remain an area of contention that will require further studies for clarification25,78,80.

with MYD88 independently of TRAF3 or TRAF6 (REF. 28). Within this complex, TRAF6 is activated, which leads to its K63-linked autoubiquitylation and to the TRAF6-dependent conjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to cIAP1 and cIAP2. The K63-linked ubiquitin chains conjugated to TRAF6 are thought to serve as scaffolds for the recruitment of the TAB2–TAB3–TAK1 and IKKα–IKKβ–NEMO complexes<sup>63,64</sup>, whereas the K63-linked ubiquitin chains on cIAP1 and cIAP2 probably activate their E3 ligase activities. Interestingly, activation of TAK1 and of its downstream MAPKs still requires translocation of the MYD88-associated complex to the cytosol, a process inhibited by TRAF3. This second step of the mechanism is achieved by cIAP1 and cIAP2, which decorate TRAF3 with K48-linked ubiquitin chains, resulting in proteasomal degradation of TRAF3 and the release of TRAF3 inhibition<sup>28,92</sup>.

In contrast to the MYD88 response, in which TRAF3 has an inhibitory function, the TRIF-dependent pathway downstream of TLR4 activation is not affected by cIAP1 and cIAP2 and relies on the K63-linked ubiquitylation of endosomal TRAF3 (REF. 4) (FIG. 5b). Consistently, depletion of cIAP1 and cIAP2 by use of the SMAC mimetic BV6 (REF. 19) in bone marrow-derived macrophages blocks LPS-induced activation of MAPKs and reduces the induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines without affecting the induction of type I IFNs or IFN-related genes<sup>28</sup>.

TLR2 senses lipoproteins at the plasma membrane, whereas TLR3 detects viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the endosomal compartment<sup>1</sup>. Interestingly, BV6-mediated depletion of cIAP1 and cIAP2 similarly affects the TLR2 pathway but has no impact on the TLR3 immune response<sup>28</sup>. Nevertheless, the absence of cIAP1 and cIAP2 was shown to sensitize cells to TLR3-induced death, which indicates that these IAPs still control some aspects of the TLR3 response<sup>17,93,94</sup>. Intriguingly, the early NF-κB activation following TLR2 and TLR4 stimulation was reported to be normal in cIAP1- and cIAP2-deficient macrophages, indicating that activation of the IKK complex does not rely on the translocation of the MYD88-associated complex to the cytosol; however, translocation of the MYD88-associated complex to the cytosol was shown to be required for the activation of TAK1 (REF. 28). Further studies are therefore needed to clearly identify the kinase that activates the IKK complex downstream of TLR2 and TLR4.

Studies in both NOD1 and NOD2 and TLR2 and TLR4 signalling pathways demonstrate a positive role of mammalian IAPs in the ubiquitylation-dependent regulation of the innate immune responses downstream of these receptors. However, the effects of IAP ubiquitin ligase activity fundamentally differ in these pathways. In the NOD1 and NOD2 signalling pathways, cIAP1 and cIAP2 generate K63-linked ubiquitin chains that function as signalling platforms, whereas in the TLR2 and TLR4 pathways, these IAPs produce K48-linked ubiquitin chains that promote the degradation of an inhibitor of the signalling platform through the proteasomal pathway.


Role of cIAP1 and cIAP2 in RIG-I signalling

RLRs are cytosolic PRRs that contribute to the antiviral innate immune response by inducing a type I IFN response and by activating NF-κB<sup>1</sup>. RIG-I, the founder member of the family, senses short dsRNA (up to 1 kb) via a DExD/H box RNA helicase domain at its C terminus. Upon recognition of viral RNA, RIG-I is conjugated with K63-linked polyubiquitin chains by the E3 ubiquitin ligases tripartite motif-containing protein 25 (TRIM25) and RING finger protein 135 (RNF135; also known as Riplet). RIG-I polyubiquitylation allows its association with IFNβ promoter stimulator 1 (IPS1; also known as MAVS, VISA or CARDIF), an adaptor protein localized on the mitochondrial membrane<sup>1,4</sup> (FIG. 6). IPS1 has a central role in the assembly of a multiprotein complex that activates distinct signalling pathways leading to both IRF3 and IRF7 and NF-κB activation. The interaction of TRAF3 with IPS1 activates TRAF3, which in turn leads to the K63-linked autoubiquitylation of TRAF3 and the subsequent activation of the IKK-related kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKε<sup>8,95–97</sup>. Next, these kinases activate IRF3 and IRF7 by phosphorylation. Phosphorylated IRF3 and IRF7 form dimers and translocate into the nucleus, where they drive expression of type I IFN and IFN-related genes<sup>98,99</sup>. TRAF3-mediated type I IFN production is negatively regulated by DUBA, a DUB that promotes removal of the K63-linked ubiquitin chains from TRAF3 (REF. 8). In addition, RIG-I-dependent NF-κB activation is thought to occur through the recruitment of TRAF2 and TRAF6 to the IPS1 complex<sup>100</sup>.

cIAP1 and cIAP2 silencing by RNA interference has recently been reported to attenuate activation of both IRF3 and NF-κB following viral infection or after cellular transfection of the synthetic dsRNA poly(I:C)<sup>29</sup>. Following RIG-I activation, cIAP1 and cIAP2 were found to associate with TRAF3 and TRAF6, and the authors of the study proposed that cIAP1 and cIAP2 positively regulate the activation of the IRF3 and NF-κB pathways by direct conjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to TRAF3 and TRAF6, respectively (FIG. 6). However, this hypothesis is not fully supported by the data provided in the study. Indeed, the authors observed that following viral infection, TRAF3 is decorated firstly with the K48-linked ubiquitin chains, which promote proteasomal degradation, and later with the K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which promote protein stability, and they provide evidence for reduced ubiquitylation of TRAF3 upon cIAP1 and cIAP2 silencing only at the earlier stage, when TRAF3 is mostly conjugated with K48-linked ubiquitin chains<sup>29</sup>. So, by analogy with the dual role of TRAF3 in TLR4 signalling, an alternative model could be that downstream of RIG-I, cIAP1 and cIAP2 promote the proteasomal degradation of a pool of TRAF3 that inhibits the NF-κB pathway and activate the type I IFN response through another mechanism<sup>28,92</sup>. Interestingly, RIPK1, a known substrate of cIAP1- and cIAP2-mediated K63-linked polyubiquitylation<sup>20,81</sup>, is recruited to the RIG-I complex upon viral infection, and its K63-linked ubiquitylation was shown to facilitate IRF3 activation<sup>101</sup>. Additional studies are required to better characterize the precise role of cIAP1 and cIAP2 in the RIG-I signalling pathways.

Role of IAPs in inflammasome activation

The pro-inflammatory IL-1 family members IL-1β and IL-18, which have a crucial role in orchestrating the host innate immune responses to infection or injury, require a two-step mechanism in order to attain their biological activity. The first step, referred to as the ‘priming’ signal, consists of the induction of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 precursor cytokines by the activation of various receptor-signalling pathways, such as the ones downstream of TLRs, NOD1 and NOD2, RIG-I, TNFR and IL-1R. The maturation and secretion of inactive pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 into bioactive inflammatory mediators then further requires proteolytic removal of their pro-domains, which is accomplished by caspase 1-mediated cleavage in the context of the inflammasome. In a similar way to other caspase family members, caspase 1 is synthesized as an inactive zymogen, procaspase 1, that gains proteolytic activity following proximity-induced activation by the inflammasome complex, which is assembled upon sensing of cellular infection or stress²³. So far, certain members of the NLR family (NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRP6, NLRP12 and NLRC4), as well as the double-stranded DNA sensor AIM2, have been reported to exhibit inflammasome activity, but the precise molecular mechanisms regulating activation of these inflammasomes remain poorly understood.

Understanding the regulatory functions of IAPs in caspase 1 activation. Recently, two independent studies have reported contrasting functions of IAPs in the regulation of procaspase 1 activation and pro-IL-1β maturation³⁰,³¹ (FIG. 7). In the first study, Labbé et al.³⁰ used a cell-free system in which the inflammasome is spontaneously activated and found that depletion of cIAP1, cIAP2 or TRAF2 results in impaired caspase 1 activation and reduced pro-IL-1β processing (FIG. 7a). Consistent with these observations, the authors report that bone marrow-derived macrophages isolated from cIAP2-deficient mice exhibit impaired caspase 1 activation and reduced IL-1β secretion in response to LPS priming followed by stimulation with different NLRP3 and NLRC4 inflammasome agonists. This effect was not attributed to differences in the LPS-dependent induction of pro-IL-1β or inflammasome components. This blunted inflammatory response was also observed *in vivo* when cIAP1- or cIAP2-deficient mice were challenged with NLRP3 inflammasome agonists. The authors suggested that the molecular mechanism accounting for this phenotype comes from the ability of cIAP1, cIAP2 and TRAF2 to associate with procaspase 1 and to promote its K63-linked polyubiquitylation, which would, directly or indirectly, facilitate assembly of the inflammasome or regulate its activity³⁰. Intriguingly, the authors observed that only short (1 h) but not long (6 h) treatment of bone marrow-derived macrophages with the SMAC mimetic BV6 (REF. 19) dampens caspase 1 activation and IL-1β secretion upon LPS priming and NLRP3 stimulation (FIG. 7a).

In marked contrast to these results, Vince et al.³¹ showed that prolonged treatment (3–6 h) of bone marrow-derived macrophages with the SMAC mimetic Compound A¹⁸ induced caspase 1 processing in the

Figure 6 | cIAP1 and cIAP2 in the regulation of RIG-I-mediated antiviral response. Upon viral double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) sensing, retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) is decorated with lysine 63 (K63)-linked ubiquitin (Ub) chains by the E3s tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25) and RING finger protein 135 (RNF135), and this allows its association with the mitochondria-localized adaptor protein interferon-β promoter stimulator 1 (IPS1). The recruitment of TNFR-associated factor 3 (TRAF3) to IPS1 then induces TRAF3 autoubiquitylation. The K63-linked ubiquitin chains generated on TRAF3 facilitate activation of the IkB kinase (IKK)-related kinases TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKKε, leading to the subsequent phosphorylation and translocation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 to the nucleus, where they drive expression of type I interferon genes. Moreover, RIG-I-dependent nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) activation is thought to involve conjugation of K63-linked ubiquitin chains to TRAF2 and TRAF6, as this would be required in order to activate the IKK complex. In a recent study, Mao et al. suggested a model (indicated by question marks in the figure) in which cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1) and cIAP2 would positively regulate both the NF-κB and type I interferon responses by acting as direct E3s conjugating K63-linked ubiquitin chains to both TRAF3 and TRAF6 (REF. 29). However, as discussed in the main text, alternative models may exist. DUBA, de-ubiquitylating enzyme A; NEMO, NF-κB essential modifier; PRR, pattern-recognition receptor.

Downstream of all the PRR pathways described so far is the transcriptional upregulation of pro-inflammatory mediators. Other PRRs contribute to the inflammatory response by assembling into caspase 1-activating platforms, called inflammasomes, which are responsible for the proteolytic maturation of pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18. The next section discusses the role of IAPs in pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 maturation.

Figure 7 | The apparently discrepant roles of IAPs in inflammasome regulation. Two recent studies have reported positive and negative regulatory roles of inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) in pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) processing. **a** | Using cells isolated from cellular IAP2 (cIAP2)-deficient mice or cells depleted of cIAP1 and cIAP2 by the use of the SMAC mimetic BV6 (1 h treatment), Labbé et al.³⁰ demonstrated that cIAP1 and cIAP2 positively regulate caspase 1 activation and pro-IL-1β processing, possibly by promoting lysine 63 (K63) ubiquitylation of caspase 1, which would allow it to be more efficiently recruited in complexes with the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and NLR family, CARD-containing 4 (NLRC4) inflammasomes. **b** | Using the SMAC mimetic Compound A (3–6 h treatment), Vince et al.³¹ demonstrated a negative regulatory function of X-linked IAP (XIAP), cIAP1 and cIAP2 in caspase 1 activation and pro-IL-1β maturation. Genetic depletion of all three IAPs, or their simultaneous inhibition by Compound A, results in receptor interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3)-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and is sufficient to activate both the NLRP3 inflammasome and caspase 8. Following priming of the cells with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), activation of caspase 1 and caspase 8 in turn results in pro-IL-1β processing. MSU, monosodium urate crystals; Ub, ubiquitin.

partially dependent on caspase 1 and NLRP3, and identified caspase 8 as responsible for caspase 1-independent processing of pro-IL-1β. These findings support previous studies that have reported processing of pro-IL-1β via a non-canonical caspase 8 inflammasome¹⁰³,¹⁰⁴. Interestingly, the authors show that in LPS-primed cells, IAP inhibition by Compound A causes RIPK3-dependent reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which is required for full pro-IL-1β maturation³¹. Importantly, the role of RIPK3 in regulating NLRP3 inflammasome activation was shown to be specific to the SMAC mimetic conditions. The role of ROS in facilitating NLRP3 inflammasome activation has previously been reported²,³,¹⁰⁵, but how RIPK3-mediated ROS generation regulates caspase 8 activity remains unclear. RIPK3-deficient bone marrow-derived macrophages treated with LPS and Compound A exhibit attenuated caspase 8 activity, which could, as suggested by the authors, result from its reduced ubiquitilation status³¹,⁴⁹,¹⁰⁶. The precise molecular link between RIPK3-mediated ROS generation and the activation of caspase 8 remains to be discovered. Taken together, the studies by Labbé et al. and Vince et al. demonstrate both positive and negative regulatory functions of IAPs in caspase 1 activation (FIG. 7). In order to reconcile or exclude some aspects of these two apparently discrepant functions of IAPs, additional studies are required.

Relation between cIAP1 and cIAP2 and mouse caspase 11. Caspase 11, the mouse orthologue of human caspase 4, has an important role in the regulation of the inflammatory response by acting upstream of caspase 1 as well as by mediating caspase 1-independent functions¹⁰⁷,¹⁰⁸. Recently, it was reported that embryonic stem cells derived from the 129 mouse strain harbour a caspase 11-inactivating mutation¹⁰⁸. As a consequence, mouse knockout lines obtained by targeting genes closely linked to the caspase 11 locus in 129 embryonic stem cells might also be mutated for caspase 11, despite extensive backcrossing of these animals to other genetic backgrounds. This is the case for the caspase 1-deficient mouse line, and phenotypes initially attributed to caspase 1 deficiency, such as resistance to sepsis, were in fact recently demonstrated to be due to the passenger caspase 11 mutation¹⁰⁸. Kenneth et al. revealed that the stable cIAP1-deficient mouse line (in which *Birc2* is constitutively knocked out)⁷², but not the stable cIAP2-deficient mouse line (in which *Birc3* is constitutively knocked out)⁷³, also carries the caspase 11 mutation owing to the proximity of *Birc2* to the caspase 11 locus⁹¹. In line with the reported role of caspase 11 in inflammation, it might therefore be important to re-evaluate the results obtained using these cIAP1-deficient mice, or cells isolated from them, in the context of caspase 1 activity. Fortunately, a *Birc2* and *Birc3* double conditional knockout mouse line generated using the C57BL/6 embryonic stem line Bruce4 carrying the wild-type allele for caspase 11 has recently been reported⁹¹,¹⁰². These mice will help us to decipher the complex relationship between cIAP1 and cIAP2 and the functions of caspase 1 and caspase 11 downstream of inflammasome activation.

**IAP antagonists in PRR-mediated diseases**

Inflammation and its physiological consequences provide the organism with a rapid, broad-spectrum way to confine the danger (infection or trauma) to the reacting area in the body, keep the challenge in check, start the healing process and return to homeostasis. Nevertheless, inflammation can also be detrimental and is linked to various severe diseases when activated chronically or in excess^{1-3}. For instance, it is well established that septic shock mainly originates from systemic activation of TLR4. Similarly, the pathogenesis of cerebral and myocardial ischaemia–reperfusion injuries involves TLR4- and TLR2-mediated inflammation^1. In addition, defects in NOD1 and NOD2 signalling are associated with inflammatory bowel diseases, in some cases through the enhancement of TLR signalling^{3,5}. So far, XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 have been reported to positively regulate the immune responses activated by TLR2 and TLR4, NOD1 and NOD2, and RIG-I. They therefore represent attractive targets for the treatment of inflammatory diseases originating from chronic or exacerbated activation of the signalling pathways downstream of these PRRs.

IPs were first investigated for their ability to inhibit apoptotic cell death, and because resistance to death is recognized as a key element in cancer progression, efforts have been made to develop antagonists of IAPs in the hope of sensitizing cancer cells to death triggers. SMAC mimetics were initially designed to interfere with the inhibitory action of XIAP on pro-apoptotic caspases, and five SMAC mimetics are currently in Phase I clinical trials for cancer^11. Unexpectedly, it was later found that SMAC mimetics not only inhibit XIAP function but also deplete cIAP1 and cIAP2 by causing them to undergo autoubiquitylation and proteasomal degradation^{18-20}. As a consequence, these compounds were found to sensitize cells to both RIPK1-dependent apoptosis and necroptosis^{13,14,16-20,109}.

The recent findings implicating XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 in PRR signalling highlight the potential use of SMAC mimetics as a promising approach for the treatment of inflammatory diseases mediated by IAP-dependent PRR signalling. IAP inhibition would limit the production of pro-inflammatory mediators induced by activation of these PRRs and consequently improve the pathological inflammatory conditions of the patients. However, as SMAC mimetics sensitize cells to death, their use might as well induce DAMPs that would worsen the inflammatory conditions of the patients. Similar detrimental consequences can also be expected in the case of negative regulation of inflammation by IAPs. Finally, the findings that IAPs regulate innate immune responses should also be taken into account when treating cancer patients with SMAC mimetics. Indeed, inhibiting IAPs may simultaneously diminish the ability of the patients to fight infections, which could result in additional clinical complications. So, tumour-targeted use of SMAC mimetics should probably be preferred to their systemic administration; however, this idea might not be true in conditions of chronic inflammation-induced tumorigenesis.

### Future directions

So far, studies have reported important ubiquitin-dependent regulatory functions of XIAP, cIAP1 and cIAP2 in the innate immune responses emerging from four classes of PRRs. It is now time to extend those studies to other PRRs and to precisely define the respective molecular contribution of each of these IAPs to the different PRR signalling pathways. Indeed, initial reports seem to indicate non-redundant functions of these IAPs, but their specific contributions remain unclear. This knowledge will probably be of great importance for the development of IAP antagonist-based therapies against PRR-mediated inflammatory diseases. Current SMAC mimetics target all IAPs together, but it might be more promising to specifically inhibit certain PRR signalling pathways, or part of them, by targeting these IAPs separately. In line with this, it might also be of importance to study the role (or roles) of the other human IAPs in innate immune responses.

Future reports on the *in vivo* effects of IAP antagonist administration in mouse models of inflammatory diseases are therefore greatly needed in order to evaluate the potential benefit of this potential therapeutic approach. As IL-1β antagonists have demonstrated their effectiveness in the treatment of human inflammatory diseases^2, it is also of primary importance to further dissect the upstream signalling pathways and to clarify whether and how IAPs modulate inflammasome activation and IL-1β secretion.
