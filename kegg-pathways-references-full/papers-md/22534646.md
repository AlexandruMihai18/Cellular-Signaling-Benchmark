Human hands and feet contain bones of a particular size and shape arranged in a precise pattern. The secreted factor sonic hedgehog (SHH) acts through the conserved hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway to regulate the digital pattern in the limbs of tetrapods (i.e. land-based vertebrates). Genetic analysis is now uncovering a remarkable set of pathogenic mutations that alter the Hh pathway, thus compromising both digit number and identity. Several of these are regulatory mutations that have the surprising attribute of misdirecting expression of Hh ligands to ectopic sites in the developing limb buds. In addition, other mutations affect a fundamental structural property of the embryonic cell that is essential to Hh signaling. In this review, we focus on the role that the Hh pathway plays in limb development, and how the many human genetic defects in this pathway are providing clues to the mechanisms that regulate limb development.

**Human limb abnormalities that affect digit number**

Structural abnormalities of the hands and feet are frequent birth defects, several of which have known genetic causes. These defects may affect just the limbs or may be part of a complex syndrome affecting several organs. Mammalian limb-bud development is based on a highly conserved pentadactyl pattern for the digits in the hands and feet [1], and deviation from five digits can be informative for clinicians and developmental biologists. Too many digits, or polydactyly (Glossary), is the most frequently observed congenital hand malformation, with a prevalence of approximately two per 1000 live births [2]. Depending on the anatomical location of the extra digits, polydactyly is classified as preaxial (on the side of the thumb and big toe) or postaxial (the opposite side). The genetic contribution to polydactyly was recently surveyed [3] and a remarkable number of individual clinical classifications (80) that include polydactyly have been assigned to 99 different genes.

**Mechanism that polarizes the limb**

During development, digit number and identity is regulated by a mechanism that initially polarizes the limb bud and then specifies digit identity and regulates growth. The complementary expression of the transcription factors GLI3, a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding protein, in the anterior half and HAND2, a member of the basic helix–loop–helix family of DNA-binding proteins, in the posterior half of the limb [4] are the first molecular indications that the early limb is polarized (Figure 1). This then predisposes the posterior margin of the limb bud to express the Shh gene, which is the crucial step in regulating spatial variation along the anteroposterior (A–P) axis of the early limb bud. The Shh gene is expressed at the posterior margin of the limb in a region that was defined in transplantation experiments during the 1960s as the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA) [5]. These experiments showed that chick embryonic limb tissue transplanted from the posterior to the anterior limb-bud margin secreted a factor, now known to be SHH, that induced the generation of extra digits.

SHH acts via the Hh signaling pathway, which is remarkably conserved from flies to mammals [6]. Much of what is known about the pathway initially came from analysis in *Drosophila*, which has only a single *Hh* gene; in mice, three homologs exist [desert hedgehog (*Dhh*), Indian hedgehog (*Ihh*) and *Shh*] (Box 1 and Figure 2).

**Glossary**

- **Acheiropia**: an autosomal recessive disorder that results in severe truncations of the arms and legs, such that there is lack of the distal extremities.
- **Acrocapitofemoral dysplasia**: a rare recessive condition characterized mainly by short limbs, dwarfism and cone-shaped epiphyses at the joints, mainly in the hands and hips.
- **Apical ectodermal ridge (AER)**: a specialized ectodermal structure that forms along the distal edge of the limb bud and acts as a major signaling center through the FGFs.
- **Brachydactyly**: a condition that affects the length of the digits, making the fingers and toes appear shorter.
- **Craniosynostosis Philadelphia type**: craniosynostosis is a condition in which one or more of the bony primordia of the infant skull prematurely ossifies, thus changing the growth pattern of the skull. Philadelphia type has associated syndactyly of the hands and feet.
- **Preaxial and postaxial polydactyly**: polydactyly means additional digits and pre-and postaxial refer to the side of the hand or foot that the extra digit appears. Preaxial is the thumb and big toe side; whereas postaxial is the opposite side.
- **Syndactyly**: a condition in which two or more digits are fused together.
- **Syndromic**: a syndromic condition is characterized by having several recognizable clinical features that occur together and are associated for diagnosis. A nonsyndromic condition has a single clinical feature.
- **Triphalangeal thumb**: whereas each finger has three phalanges (the small bones of the digits), the thumb only has two. In this condition, the thumb has an extra phalanx and often has the appearance of a finger.
- **Zone of polarizing activity (ZPA)**: an area of mesenchymal cells located along the posterior margin of the limb bud that produces SHH. SHH patterns the early limb bud along the A–P axis, specifying digit identity and the number of digits that will form.
- **ZPA regulatory sequence (ZRS)**: an approximately 800-bp *cis*-regulatory sequence that is necessary and sufficient for the limb specific expression of the *Shh* gene.

Figure 1. Expression of genes that polarize the limb and regulate sonic hedgehog (*Shh*) expression in the zone of polarizing activity (ZPA). The earliest limb bud (a) is polarized by the expression of *GLI3* in the anterior (A) and by *HAND2* (which downregulates *GLI3*) in the posterior (P). The expression of the *5'Hoxd* and *Shh* genes follow *Hand2* expression and *Shh* is upregulated by *HAND2* in the ZPA. Once *SHH* is produced (b), it maintains the expression of *Hand2* and the *5'Hoxd* genes in a regulatory loop. The gradient of *GLI3A* is shown below. (c) Distal production of *ETV4/ETV5* and *ETS1/GABPα* in overlapping patterns. *ETV4/ETV5* ensures that ectopic expression does not occur in the wild-type limb, whereas *ETS1/GABPα* determines the position of the *Shh* expression boundary.

SHH signaling regulates the proteolytic processing of members of the GLI (after glioma) family of proteins, one of which, *GLI3*, is of particular interest early in limb development (Figure 1). *GLI3* is expressed across the limb bud; however, in the posterior of the limb bud, where *SHH* concentrations are high, *GLI3* is present in the full-length activator form, *Gli3A*; by contrast, in the anterior, where *SHH* is low or undetectable, *GLI3* is proteolytically processed into the repressor form, *GLI3R* [7]. The relative concentration of *GLI3A:GLI3R* across the developing limb bud specifies the differences between the fingers. The most distinctive digit, the thumb, develops from a region of the limb bud that has the highest concentration of *GLI3R* and no detectable *SHH* activity. In addition, *SHH* and *GLI3* function together to constrain the number of digits produced, thus ensuring pentadactyly [8,9]. In mice, the absence of both *SHH* and *GLI3* (*Shh⁻/⁻;Gli3⁻/⁻*), gives rise to multiple, unspecified digits forming a polydactylous paw with as many as six to 11 unspecified digits. This indicates that limb buds have an intrinsic capacity to produce digit primordia and that this process is unregulated in the absence of both *SHH* and *GLI3*.

Several models have been produced to explain *SHH* activity [10]; a recent model suggests that *SHH* [11,12] integrates two different activities to regulate early limb-bud development. *SHH* initially acts as a morphogen to specify digit identity at the earliest stages of limb development. Subsequently, it exhibits mitogenic activity that ensures the production of a sufficient number of cells to promote the normal complement of digits. Together, these two activities of *SHH* are responsible for specifying the identity of each digit and, as the limb bud expands, the position within the limb bud in which each forms. This is observed as a progressive formation of the digits, such that there is a stereotypical order in which each digit appears. For example, in the mouse, digit 4 appears first in the limb bud followed in order and rapid succession by digits 2, 5 and then 3 (digit 1 appears to be the last to form). If cellular expansion in the limb bud is reduced by attenuating *SHH* activity, the digits are lost in the reverse order, with digit 3 being the first to disappear.

**Box 1. Conservation of the Hh pathway**

The *Hh* gene and much of the *Hh* signaling pathway is conserved from flies to mice [6] (Figure 2, main text). In *Drosophila*, one *Hh* gene has been identified, whereas in mice three homologs exist: *Dhh*, *Ihh* and *Shh*. In signaling cells, *Hh* is synthesized, cleaved and lipid modified before being secreted [73]. In responding cells, *Hh* binds to the Patched (*Ptc*) coreceptor, alleviating *Ptc* inhibition of the seven-pass transmembrane protein Smoothened (*Smo*) and activating the downstream pathway [74].

In *Drosophila*, the transcriptional effector of *Hh* signaling is called Cubitus interruptus (*Ci*) and exists in two forms; a full-length activator protein, and a truncated repressor protein generated by proteolytic processing [75]. The processing of *Ci* is blocked by *Hh*, which also serves to increase activity of the activator form [76]. In mammals, members of the GLI protein family are homologs of *Ci*. There are three members of the Gli family in vertebrates. *Gli1* acts as a transcriptional activator, whereas *Gli2* and *Gli3* exist in two forms: a full-length activator form and a truncated transcriptional repressor [6].

Phosphorylation of *Ci* or *Gli* allows binding of the ubiquitin ligase Slimb (*Drosophila*) or B-TrCP (mammals) and subsequent polyubiquitination and proteasome-mediated processing to their activator forms [77]. Meanwhile, the activity of both *CiA* and *GliA* can be inhibited by Suppressor of fused [SUFU (mouse) or Su(Fu) (flies)] [78].

The proteins Fused (*Fu*) and Costal 2 (*Cos2*) play an important role in the *Hh* signaling in *Drosophila* [79,80]. Knockdown of *Fu* in mouse cells does not disrupt *Gli* signaling. The *Cos2* homologs in mammals, Kif7 and Kif27, as well as *Cos2* from *Drosophila* itself, have been shown to regulate *GLI* in mammalian cells, suggesting a conserved regulatory interaction [81].

### Limb polarity and digit specification

Attempts to understand the genetic basis of preaxial polydactyly led to the identification of the *cis*-regulatory element responsible for controlling expression of *Shh* in the posterior part of the limb [13]. This 750–800-bp enhancer sequence is both necessary and sufficient for regulating the spatial and temporal activity of *Shh*, which in turn defines the ZPA; therefore, it was called the ZPA regulatory sequence (ZRS) (Figure 3). The ZRS is highly conserved in all

Figure 2. Conservation of the Hh signaling pathway. (a) Schematic representation of key components of the Drosophila HH signaling pathway in the absence (top) or presence (bottom) of HH. In the absence of ligand, Patched (PTC) inhibits Smoothened (SMO), which is held in intracellular vesicles (yellow ovals). A complex of proteins, including cubitus interruptus (Ci), Costal2 (COS2) and several kinases, is established. Phosphorylation of Ci establishes recognition signals for SLIMB leading to partial degradation of Ci by the proteasome and formation of the repressor form (CI-R). CI-R then translocates to the nucleus, where it represses transcription of HH targets. Binding of secreted HH to PTC, blocks PTC activity and releases SMO from inhibition. SMO moves to the plasma membrane, where phosphorylation allows interaction with COS2. Subsequent phosphorylation of COS2 by FU leads to release of unphosphorylated, full-length Ci, which can translocate to the nucleus where it promotes transcriptional activation. (b) Schematic representation of key conserved components of the vertebrate HH signaling pathway. The cilium (which is absent in Drosophila) is represented by the central axoneme and the centrosome and basal bodies (gray). In the absence of SHH ligand, PTCH1 inhibits SMO, which is held in intracellular vesicles. GLI3 is kept in the primary cilium in a complex with KIF7 and SUFU. Phosphorylation of GLI3 by kinases allows its recognition by β-TRCP and leads to partial degradation by the proteasome, resulting in the formation of the repressor molecule. Activation by SHH relieves the inhibition of SMO by PTCH1. SMO becomes phosphorylated by GRK2, binds to β-ARRESTIN and KIF3A, and is trafficked to the cilium. This relieves the inhibitory effect of SUFU and allows the full-length GLI3 to translocate to the nucleus and activate target genes. Homologous genes in Drosophila and vertebrates are colored similarly.

vertebrates with opposing appendages, including fish. In addition, the ZRS is located inside an intron of the limb region 1 homolog (Lmbr1) gene, which has no known role in limb development and operates over a long distance to activate the Shh promoter (800 kb–1 Mb away) in mice and humans.

It is still an open question how the ZRS directs Shh expression to the ZPA. It is known that the expression of Shh depends on the initial establishment of A–P polarity, and targeted mutations of the Hand2 gene show a role for this gene in the early determinative process that functions upstream of Shh expression [14]. However, a low basal level of Shh expression is established in the absence of HAND2 [14]. Therefore, initiation of Shh expression may rely on additional signals, and one of these may emanate from a specialized ectoderm that resides at the proximal border of the apical ectodermal ridge (AER; Figure 1), operating through the T box-containing transcription factor TBX2 [15]. As the limb bud emerges, the Hoxd gene cluster is activated and becomes confined to the posterior mesenchyme. Genetic analysis has shown that the 5′HOXD factors

are essential for activation of Shh expression in the ZPA [16] and, in agreement with this, the 5′HOXD proteins (specifically HOXD10 and 13) may bind to the ZRS [17]. In addition, the regulatory function of HAND2 is mediated by direct binding near or at the ZRS and may bind as an activating protein complex with HOXD13 (and other 5′HOXD proteins) [14]. Given that the ZRS is located a long distance from its target gene, it is crucial to convert transcription factor binding to the ZRS into expression of Shh. In accord, chromosome architecture changes specifically in the expressing cells within the limb bud and two events are observed to occur. First, a chromosomal looping mechanism brings the ZRS close to the Shh promoter where they interact. Second, the Shh locus moves out of its chromosomal territory; further genetic analysis suggests that this is the event that relates directly to Shh activation [18].

Once Shh expression is initiated, members of the ETS transcription factor family act to establish the boundary of expression (Figure 1). Five ETS binding sites have been identified in the ZRS (Figure 3), at which two ETS factors, ETS1 and GABPα, were shown to bind [19]. Occupancy by

Figure 3. Mutations and chromosomal lesions in the Shh locus responsible for limb abnormalities. (a) Shh gene and the upstream regulatory region (including enhancers shown as pink boxes). The ZRS cis-activator is shown as a gray box inside the Lmbr1 gene, enlarged above to show the number and position of the point mutations that cause preaxial polydactyly. Some of the other Shh enhancers are shown in pink. The position [30] of the human (black), mouse (red), cat (green) and chicken (gray) mutations are shown above the enlarged ZRS. The position of the ETS (ETS1/GABPa) (green ovals) and ETV (ETV4/ETV5) (blue ovals) binding sites identified by biochemical and chromatin immunoprecipitation methods [17] are shown below the ZRS. The position of the Werner mesomelic syndrome mutations [29] are highlighted in blue. Below the wild-type Shh locus is a representative intrachromosomal duplication that results in triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly (TPTPS). These duplications can be of various sizes, such that the duplicated ZRSs can reside at various distances from the other. (b) Approximate position of the breakpoints of the intrachromosomal inversion on human chromosome 7. Below the chromosome is a representation of the position of the Shh gene before and after the inversion, showing that Shh is now regulated by another limb enhancer, a process called (enhancer adoption) [41].

these factors at multiple sites within the ZRS is required to set the appropriate boundary of expression in the posterior mesenchyme. Two other ETS factors, the closely related ETV4 and ETV5, act redundantly to oppose ETS1/GABPα activation. Limb buds that are deficient in both ETV4 and ETV5 ectopically express Shh in a domain in mesenchyme at the anterior margin of the limb [20,21], indicating that

their normal role is to restrict Shh expression to the posterior region of the limb. Although ETV4/5 bind to two sites within the ZRS, the binding at one of these sites is sufficient to regulate Shh negatively in the anterior domain [19]. In addition to this regulatory role, ETV4 and ETV5 were shown to modulate the activity of two other transcription factors, TWIST1 and HAND2, which

regulate Shh expression. A fine balance is proposed for TWIST1, an inhibitor of Shh expression, in the anterior of the limb and the positive regulator HAND2. An ETV4/5–TWIST1 complex is important in promoting the TWIST1 inhibitory activity in the ectopic domain, perhaps by inhibiting dimerization of TWIST1–HAND2 [22], which acts as an activator.

Finally, fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling is central to Shh expression, both as a positive and a negative regulator (Figure 1). The FGFs 4, 8, 9 and 17 are expressed in the AER [23] (Figure 1) and mediate limb bud outgrowth and maintenance of Shh expression in the ZPA. In addition, FGFs regulate the production of ETV4 and ETV5 and so are responsible for repression of Shh expression ectopically at the anterior margin [20,21,23].

**Limb deformities due to aberrant Shh expression**

Regulatory mutations in the ZRS cause misexpression of Shh and are associated with limb malformations [24]. The limb defects that result from a mutant ZRS fall into different clinical classifications that show a robust genotype–phenotype correlation but comprise an overlapping spectrum of digit abnormalities. These are preaxial polydactyly type II (PPD2, MIM# 174500), which includes isolated triphalangeal thumb, triphalangeal thumb-polysyndactyly syndrome (TPTPS), syndactyly type IV (SD4, MIM# 186200) and Werner mesomelic syndrome (WMS) [13,25–32] (Figure 4). It has been suggested that this group of limb defects should be collectively referred to as ‘ZRS-associated syndromes’ [29].

PPD2 is characterized by a triphalangeal thumb (Figure 4) sometimes leading to the appearance of a five-fingered hand and, in some cases, may be accompanied by additional digits. Fifteen single-point mutations in the human ZRS have been identified that are associated with this limb abnormality (Figure 3). Extra toes have also been frequently observed in other species, including mice [13,33,34], cats [35] and chickens [36–38], and these abnormalities are associated with seven more point mutations in the ZRS. A mutation in polydactylous dogs was

Bones are represented along the top, and each digit is numbered, the triphalangeal thumb is labeled 'T' and digits that cannot be accurately identified are labeled with an asterisk. Below are pictures of hands of patients with the various disorders [26,28,87,88]. Werner mesomelic syndrome [29] in (b) is associated with short-limb dwarfism.

found in a conserved domain upstream of the ZRS, called  
the pre-ZRS; however, it is not clear how this domain  
regulates Shh expression [39]. Much of the understanding  
of the molecular mechanism underlying PPD2 comes from  
studies in mice. A single nucleotide change in the sequence  
of the ZRS is sufficient to generate ectopic production of  
Shh such that it is anomalously expressed at the opposite,  
anterior margin of the limb bud [30, 35, 40]. Ectopic Shh  
expression presumably produces an additional ZPA and,  
consequently, affects the GLI3R:GLI3A ratio, leading to  
respecification of the developing anterior digits. The phe-  
notypic outcome is seen in some cases as the transforma-  
tion of the thumb to a fifth finger, often accompanied by the  
production of additional digits.

Mechanisms that give rise to anomalous expression of  
Shh are being investigated. The two ETS factors that  
regulate the SHH expression boundary play a central role  
in generating polydactyly in two different families [19]. In  
these families, ZRS point mutations were shown to give  
rise to new, additional ETS1/GABPα binding sites, leading  
to the upregulation of the ZRS in the posterior margin of  
the limb bud, setting a wider boundary of expression and  
causing ectopic expression at the anterior margin. Because  
both *Ets1* and *Gabpa* genes are expressed at the anterior  
margin (in mice) and the ZRS is primed for expression in  
this ectopic region [18], the additional binding sites are  
sufficient to override the inhibition of Shh expression and  
cause ectopic expression. Another point mutation that  
changes transcription factor binding to the ZRS was  
reported for a polydactylous mouse designated DZ [34].  
In this case, the point mutation introduced a higher affinity  
binding site in the ZRS recognized by the nuclear factor  
HnRNP U, which was postulated to mediate the interac-  
tion between the cis-regulator and the 5′ end of the Shh  
gene.

WMS (Figure 4) is an autosomal dominant disorder with  
preaxial polydactyly of the hands and feet that also shows  
the additional, distinctive characteristic of associated  
dwarfism [13, 29]. This condition appears to be at the severe  
end of the phenotypic spectrum of ZRS mutations. The  
short stature is the result of tibial hypoplasia (i.e. very  
small or absent tibia). The molecular basis for this disorder  
is also a point mutation, but at a specific position, nucleo-  
tide 404 (either a G>A or G>C change) (Figure 3), of the  
ZRS. Again, this mutation is likely to have an effect on  
transcription factor binding that is causative of the pheno-  
type. Analysis of ZRS activity carrying the G>A mutation  
by mouse transgenesis suggests that expression in the  
ectopic domain occurs at a high level and extends broadly  
along the anterior limb-bud margin [35]. This level of  
ectopic SHH production may disrupt specification of the  
tibia and affect chondrogenesis.

Recently, the genetic basis of a severe form of polysyn-  
dactyly (extra digits with fusions of digits, particularly of  
the hands) was reported. Haas type (syndactyly type IV)  
polysyndactyly and TPTPS [27–29] (Figure 4) show a  
consistent association with intrachromosomal duplica-  
tions involving the genomic region that contains the  
ZRS, leading to a tandem duplication of the ZRS (or  
triplication in one patient) (Figure 3). The molecular  
mechanism that gives rise to this limb phenotype is not  
known; however, it is reasonable to speculate that ectopic  
expression of SHH in the anterior margin of the limb bud is  
responsible for the polydactyly. The role that SHH expres-  
sion plays in the syndactyly phenotype in patients with  
either Haas-type polysyndactyly or TPTPS is less clear;  
however, an isolated case of a patient with a distinct form  
of syndactyly was recently reported that may shed some  
light on this process. This patient had fusions of all fingers  
and toes along the entire length of each digit, which was  
shown to involve misregulation of the SHH gene in the  
limb but did not involve the ZRS [41]. Chromosomal  
analysis revealed that this patient had an intrachromo-  
somal inversion (Figure 3) with one breakpoint upstream  
of the SHH gene such that it ended up under the influence  
of a different enhancer at the other end of the breakpoint,  
freeing it from the influence of the ZRS and other regula-  
tors. This event was termed ‘enhancer adoption’. In mouse  
transgenics, this new enhancer was shown to drive ex-  
pression broadly in the limb, extending to later develop-  
mental stages and persisting in the interdigital  
mesenchyme. Further transgenic studies showed that,  
by placing this enhancer upstream of the mouse Shh gene,  
expression was directed to the interdigital cells at a later  
than normal stage in development. Syndactyly is probably  
the result of the rescue of the interdigital tissue from cell  
death due to this abnormal expression of Shh. This also  
suggests that the ZRS duplications that cause TPTPS  
similarly affect the temporal expression of SHH in the  
interdigital regions of the limb.

Another chromosomal inversion with a breakpoint be-  
tween Shh and the ZRS was previously reported in mice for  
the *Dsh* (short digits) mutation [42]. Shh is ectopically  
activated in the cartilage of early digit primordia of the  
*Dsh* heterozygous embryo, representing another example  
of spatial and temporal misregulation due to a chromo-  
somal rearrangement. However, in this case, it was postu-  
lated that the misexpression of Shh was the result of the  
removal of a repressor that enabled additional expression  
to occur in the early developing digits.

One other potential regulatory mutation of the SHH  
gene was uncovered in the genetic analysis of a condition  
called acheiropia (MIM# 200500), a rare, recessive con-  
dition in which the hands and feet are lacking. This  
phenotype is similar to that seen in mice lacking ZRS  
activity [43]. However, the genetic lesion reported for these  
families [44] is a 4–6 kb deletion upstream (approximately  
30 kb) of the ZRS. These genetic data suggest that a second,  
limb-specific regulatory component exists within the de-  
leted DNA, the role of which may be to modify ZRS activity.  
Taken together, these examples illustrate several dif-  
ferent mechanisms that can alter the regulation of Shh,  
with a significant impact on the developing embryo. These  
range from simple nucleotide changes in the ZRS that  
cause ectopic expression to duplications that, more sur-  
prisingly, appear to affect both spatial and temporal ex-  
pression. These mutational mechanisms only appear to  
affect Shh limb expression, as there is no evidence that the  
expression is misdirected outside the limb bud. Finally,  
acheiropia deletions appear to result in a lack of Shh  
limb expression due to removal of an element that modifies  
ZRS activity.

Review

Ihh misregulation also causes limb abnormalities Another Hh signaling factor, Ihh, is expressed in the cartilage of the developing long bones in the limb. Here, Ihh is expressed within the growth plate, where it is responsible for regulation of chondrocyte proliferation and differentiation [45]. Ihh is not expressed at early limb-bud stages when Shh is expressed in the posterior mesenchyme, suggesting that Ihh has a role distinct from Shh. Despite this, IHH and Shh operate along similar signaling pathways, including regulation of the conserved target GLI [46].

In humans, loss-of-function mutations in the IHH gene result in the autosomal recessive condition acrocapitofe- moral dysplasia (MIM# 607778) [47], while gain-of- function mutations of IHH result in brachydactyly type A1 (MIM# 112500) [48,49]. Evidence suggests that the Ihh gene has a similar regulatory landscape as Shh and that Ihh is also under long-range regulatory control. This has been highlighted through analysis of three families with syndactyly type 1 (including some family members with polydactyly) and craniosynostosis Philadelphia type (MIM# 601222). This condition was found to map to a single locus at 2q35. Further analysis revealed that all three families contained distinct microduplications, but all shared the same 9-kb region located within the intron of a gene 40 kb upstream of IHH. This shared region contains a putative distant regulator of IHH and represents a similar situation to the duplication of the ZRS in the cases of TPTPS [50].

Disruption of the long-range regulation of Ihh is also considered to be the cause of the polydactyly phenotype seen in the Doublefoot (Dbf) mouse mutant. Dbf is an autosomal dominant mutation that results in extreme polydactyly of all four limbs, containing six to nine digits on each paw that are triphalangeal and arise preaxially [51,52]. Ihh is expressed ectopically within the mutant limb bud across the A-P axis, disrupting normal SHH activity and overriding Shh expression usually driven by the ZRS. A 600-kb deletion starting approximately 50 kb upstream of Ihh underlies the Dbf phenotype. This region is expected to contain a cis-acting regulatory element, which could be a repressor of Ihh expression that is removed by the deletion or, alternatively, a cryptic enhancer that may normally be located beyond the deleted region and moves into an activating position [53].

Gli3 mutants affect Hh signaling The zinc finger-containing transcription factor GLI3 is the ultimate target for Shh signaling in the early limb bud [54]. Heterozygous mutations in the GLI3 gene cause Greig cephalopolysyndactyly syndrome (GCPS: MIM# 175700) and Pallister-Hall syndrome (PHS MIM# 146510), both of which include polydactyly in the spectrum of disorders [55,56]. In addition, in rare cases, GLI3 mutations cause nonsyndromic polydactyly (MIM# 174700). The PHS and GCPS phenotypes are clinically distinct and, as with the Shh regulatory mutants, there is a robust genotype-phenotype correlation [57]. The polydactyly phenotype in PHS has a central or insertional polydactyly; whereas GCPS exhibits pre-or postaxial polydactyly (most commonly preaxial of the feet and postaxial of the hands) with variable syndactyly

[58]. Truncating mutations in the middle third of the Gli3 gene cause PHS, whereas large deletions or truncation mutations in the amino or carboxy terminal third of the gene cause GCPS. PHS mutations are predicted to be dominant mutations in which the truncated protein ends near the proteolytic cleavage site to constitutively produce a repressor protein with a similar activity to GLI3R. This would skew the balance of the activator and the repressor forms of GLI3, resulting in an anteriorizing affect on the limb bud. GCPS mutations are predicted to be null mutations, and the phenotype results from a haploinsufficiency, suggesting that absolute amounts of GLI3R and GLI3A are required for development. Mouse mutations that represent Gli3 loss of function (Gli3xt and Gli3pdn) and a mutation (Gli3Δ699) that causes a PHS-like truncation of the protein near the proteolytic cleavage site support the notion that GCPS and PHS are clinically distinct [59,60]. Mouse studies suggest that GLI3 has a Shh-independent activity in early limb-bud stages [60], acting to restrict HAND2 expression (Figure 1); however, it is not clear what role this independent activity plays in heterozygous human GLI3 mutations.

Cilia, the Hh pathway and limb patterning Transduction of the Hh signal to the GLI protein is a multistep process (Box 2 and Figure 2) and, over the past decade, it has become clear that there is a connection between the complex steps of the Hh pathway and a unique structural component of the cell, the cilia (reviewed in [61– 63]). Although the cilia have several signaling roles, it has been suggested [64] that, in early development, primary cilia in vertebrates are dedicated to Hh signal transduction. The phenotypes caused by loss of cilia-associated proteins are syndromic, and not all patients show limb abnormalities, which suggests that cilia play an active role in mediating Hh signaling and do not simply serve as a compartment in which pathway components are concentrated.

The primary cilium is a small organelle that projects from the surface of the cell. It comprises a central structure of microtubules, called the axoneme, that functions to maintain the cilium and extends the structure by transport of particles along its length. This intraflagellar transport (IFT) mechanism transports molecules from the base to the tip of the cilium. Evidence suggests that components of the IFT machinery are involved in the Hh signaling pathway. The GLI proteins (Gli2 and Gli3) are localized at the cilia tip and trafficked along the axoneme in response to Hh signaling [65]. Thus, mutations in those proteins involved in the trafficking process often have phenotypes reminiscent of Hh signaling defects (Figure 2).

Several congenital human disorders, called ciliopathies, result from recessive mutations in genes that have a role in the cilia or the basal body [66]. Ciliopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases presenting with a broad spectrum of clinical phenotypes, including pre-and postaxial polydactyly. For example, Joubert syndrome (MIM# 213300), Meckel-Gruber syndrome (MIM# 249000), and Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS, MIM# 209900) are all associated with polydactyly. Joubert syndrome can result from mutations in at least ten genes and is characterized by a specific brain malformation with additional pathologies.

Box 2. Vertebrate Hh signaling in the cilium

The main difference between mammalian and *Drosophila* Hh signaling is the central role played by cilia in mammals but not in flies [6] (Figure 2, main text). *Drosophila* lacking cilia develop almost normally, indicating that cilia are not required for *Drosophila* Hh signaling [82]. In vertebrates, several steps from recognition of SHH to the processing of GLI1-3 (here referred to as GLI) in the limb involve the cilium and IFT [83]. The cilium is maintained and extended by transport of particles along the axoneme (reviewed in [60–62]). The transport of molecules toward the cilium tip, via IFT, is called 'anterograde trafficking' (kinesin motor driven) and down the axoneme toward the base of the cilium is referred to as 'retrograde trafficking' (dynein driven) [62,63].

Signal transduction takes place in the cilium, where PTCH1 is located in the absence of the ligand and represses the function of smoothened (SMO), which resides in the repressed state in cytoplasmic vesicles [84]. Upon activation by SHH, PTCH1 is internalized and SMO is phosphorylated by a G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK2). This phosphorylation promotes SMO binding to β-arrestin and Kif3a, a requirement for the trafficking of SMO into the cilium, where it activates GLI.

Full-length GLIs are present in the cilium in a complex with the anterograde IFT kinesin motor KIF7 [68]. SUFU promotes the truncation of GLI into the repressor form (GLIR) and the retrograde IFT-dynein motor enables GLIR to reach the nucleus. Activation of SMO relieves the inhibition that SUFU exerts and promotes the activator form of GLI (GLIA) [85,86]. This process is promoted by KIF7, which may also block the function of SUFU. GLIA reaches the nucleus and activates the transcription of Hh targets genes, which include PTCH.

In the absence of SHH signaling, the processing of GLIs requires regulated proteolysis by the large multiprotein proteasome complex. The GLIs are sequentially phosphorylated by kinases producing a phosphopeptide domain that is recognized by β-TrCP, which recruits an SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Ubiquitination targets Gli3 to the proteosome and initiates a limited degradation process, allowing GLIR to be transported to the nucleus, where it inhibits transcription [6].

thus inhibiting the signaling process [72]. Both routes would disrupt GLI3 processing, affecting the GLI3R:GLI3A ratio and creating digit abnormalities, some phenocopying GCPS or PHS.

### Concluding remarks

Several mutational mechanisms alter Hh signaling at different points in the pathway often impacting on the developing limb bud. Regulatory mutations affecting Shh expression play a central role in generating preaxial polydactyly. In some cases, regulatory mutations affecting expression of the closely related molecule, IHH, override normal developmental processes to affect adversely the developing limb. It appears that these and an increasingly large number of other mutations ultimately disrupt proteolytic processing of GLI3, the prime target for Hh signaling. These other mutations include those that directly affect the structure of GLI3 and those that affect the cilia, a complex cellular structure that has a significant investment in Hh signaling. The large number of different clinical manifestations, that includes the polydactyly phenotype (at least 80 have been described) [3], is a hallmark of the hundreds of genes, especially those that affect ciliogenesis, involved in Hh signaling, presenting a considerable overall target for pathogenic mutations. It is clear that further genetic analysis of limb patterning will be informative in generating insights into not only developmental biology, but also the basic biology of the cell.
