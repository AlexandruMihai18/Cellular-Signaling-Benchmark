# PRIMATE DEFENSINS

**Robert I. Lehrer**

Abstract | Defensins are endogenous, cysteine-rich antimicrobial peptides that contribute to host defence against bacterial, fungal and viral infections. There are three subfamilies of defensins in primates: α-defensins are most common in neutrophils and Paneth cells of the small intestine; β-defensins protect the skin and the mucous membranes of the respiratory, genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts; and θ-defensins, which are expressed only in Old World monkeys, lesser apes and orangutans, are lectins with broad-spectrum antiviral efficacy. Here, their discovery and recent advances in understanding their properties and functions are described.

Although microorganisms surround and vastly outnumber us, very few succeed in causing illness. To cause systemic infection, microorganisms must first enter and then resist counterattacks from the host. The credit for the felicitous state of our ‘homeland security’ goes largely to the innate immune system, which reinforces the physical barriers to entry — the skin and mucous membranes — by producing chemical deterrents such as antimicrobial peptides. Microorganisms that cross this chemo-mechanical obstacle then face close encounters with resident macrophages and ‘identity checks’ by various humoral protectants, including lectins and complement. If these measures are inadequate to identify and remove the threat, chemokines and other alarm signals summon circulating polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) (FIG. 1) to the scene.

The PMNs form a highly mobile ‘strike force’, equipped with multiple ‘weapons of microbial destruction’ (WMDs). In mammals, antimicrobial peptides that belong to the defensin¹² or cathelicidin³⁴ families comprise a significant part of the PMN armamentarium. Human PMNs contain four α-defensins (HNP-1– HNP-4), and one cathelicidin. The α-defensins are stored in primary (azurophil) granules and they constitute 30–50% of the total protein of these organelles⁵. The cathelicidin, **hCAP-18/LL-37**, is stored as an inactive precursor in the secondary (specific) granules of the PMNs. Unlike the fully processed and ‘battle-ready’ defensins, hCAP-18/LL-37 requires activation by proteinase-3 to acquire antimicrobial potency⁶⁷. The contents of the azurophil granules are preferentially delivered to phagocytic vacuoles, whereas those of the specific granules are mainly delivered to the extracellular milieu⁸⁹. The storage of defensins and cathelicidins in different subcellular compartments has implications for their respective theatres of operation.

The type and number of antimicrobial peptides in mammalian PMNs vary from species to species. Bovine PMNs lack α-defensins, but have numerous β-defensins¹⁰ and many cathelicidins⁴. Rabbit PMNs contain one cathelicidin (CAP-18)¹¹ and six different α-defensins¹²; their total defensin content greatly exceeds that of human PMNs. Porcine and ovine PMNs lack defensins, but each contains many cathelicidins⁴,¹³,¹⁴. Rat¹⁵ and mouse¹⁶ PMNs contain one cathelicidin, but whereas rat PMNs also contain several α-defensins¹⁷,¹⁸, mouse PMNs completely lack defensins¹⁹. Finally, in addition to their α-defensins²² and a cathelicidin (RL-37)²¹, the PMNs of rhesus monkeys contain θ-defensins — circular octadecapeptides with potent antiviral properties²²⁻²⁴.

The antimicrobial mechanisms of PMNs are not limited to the presence of antimicrobial peptides. PMNs can also subject microbial invaders to a barrage of toxic oxidants that are formed by reactions between the superoxide anions produced by NADPH oxidase and myeloperoxidase, which is another component of the azurophil granules. In some species²⁵, PMNs also contain products that are derived from a type 2 inducible nitric oxide synthase (**iNOS**). So, PMNs can potentially generate a dynamic mixture of hydrogen peroxide, hydroxyl radicals, singlet oxygen, ozone²⁶, hypochlorite and chloramines, nitric oxide and peroxynitrite²²,²⁷.

leukin/phagocytin/CAP molecules were reported in 1985 (REFS 12,38), when they were renamed defensins¹ and recognized as natural peptide antibiotics.

As well as being expressed in PMNs, α-defensins are also expressed by Paneth cells in humans (HD-5 and HD-6) and mice (cryptdins)³⁹⁻⁴³. These granule-containing secretory cells are found in the basal regions of the Lieberkuhn crypts in the small intestine, and release their granules in response to autonomic or chemical stimuli that signal the entry of food or bacteria into the small intestine⁴⁴. Paneth cells contain and secrete many other molecules that are involved in antimicrobial defence, including lysozyme, secretory phospholipase A₂, tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and immunoglobulin A (IgA)⁴⁵. In rats, Paneth cells also express xanthine dehydrogenase/xanthine oxidase⁴⁶,⁴⁷, which can generate reactive oxygen intermediates. Although the Paneth cells of an inbred laboratory mouse express up to 20 different α-defensins, the PMNs of these mice express none¹⁹. By contrast, rat PMNs and Paneth cells each express a few α-defensins, similar to human PMNs and Paneth cells¹⁷,¹⁸.

β-defensins were described in bovine tracheal epithelial cells in 1991 (REF.48) and in bovine granulocytes in 1993 (REF.10). So far, four human β-defensins (HBD-1–HBD-4) have been described in some detail⁴⁹⁻⁵³, but many additional human β-defensin genes exist and their functions remain to be explored⁵⁴⁻⁵⁶. α-defensin genes and many β-defensin genes occupy adjacent loci on human chromosome 8p22-p23, which is consistent with evolution from a common ancestral gene⁵⁶⁻⁵⁸. As β-defensins also exist in reptiles and birds, whereas α-defensins have been identified only in mammals, β-defensins arose before α-defensins⁵⁹.

FIGURE 2 shows four human α-defensins and four human β-defensins. The conserved cysteines and the pattern of pairing between them are characteristic of both defensin subfamilies. In both subfamilies, cysteine 1 is located near the amino terminus and cysteines 5 and 6 are near the carboxyl terminus. Consequently, the bonding between cysteines 1 and 6 in α-defensins and of cysteines 1 and 5 in β-defensins renders the peptides macro-cyclic. Few other residues are invariantly conserved. In HNP-3, there is a stabilizing salt-bridge between two conserved residues, an arginine residue and a glutamate residue, and the more distal of two conserved glycine residues is involved in the β-turn between the second and third β-strands⁶⁰.

The large number of α- and β-defensin genes has been attributed to several gene reduplication events, and their diverse sequences are thought to be due to positive selection of random mutations by different infectious challenges⁶¹⁻⁶⁵. Collectively, the four human β-defensins shown in FIG. 2 contain 17 lysines and 19 arginines; this distribution is typical for β-defensins from other animals. By contrast, lysine residues are relatively rare in the α-defensins. The selection factors that have skewed the arginine:lysine ratio of PMN α-defensins are not yet known, but analysis of the two α-defensins expressed in the rabbit kidney (RK-1 and RK-2)⁶⁶ might provide a clue as together they contain 4 arginines and 7 lysines.

PMNs, polymorphonuclear leukocytes.

Could the arginine-rich nature of myeloid defensins enhance their function in the chemical maelstrom of the PMN phagosome? It has been shown that arginine is superior to lysine in capturing and retaining active chlorine moieties generated by myeloperoxidase (R.I.L., unpublished observations). However, to paraphrase Fermat, the margins of this review do not allow presentation of these data here.

FIGURE 3 shows the three-dimensional structures of the α- and β-defensins and also highlights the marked cationic nature of HBD-3 — which has a net charge of +9 due to the presence of 8 arginine and 5 lysine residues, offset by only four acidic residues. The six human α-defensins (HNP-1–4 in PMNs and HD-5 and -6 in Paneth cells) have net charges between +2 (HNP-3) and +5 (HD-5). Indeed, it was their less-cationic nature compared with the α-defensins of rabbit PMNs that allowed human α-defensins to escape detection in the early days of phagocytin/CAP research.

θ-defensins are the most recently identified defensin subfamily and were discovered in rhesus monkey PMNs. The genes encoding these molecules (DEFT genes) are mutated α-defensin (DEFA) genes that contain a premature stop codon, which stops translation after only 12 residues of the α-defensin domain have been generated. One of the bovine cathelicidins is a dodecapeptide called bacitracin (FIG. 4a); it is therefore feasible that a defensin dodecapeptide could be produced by the usual steps of α-defensin processing. Remarkably however, in monkey PMNs this dodecapeptide is used as a building block. Although the intermediate processing steps are unknown, two of these building blocks are trimmed and spliced to form a cyclic octadecapeptide that contains nine residues (including 3 cysteine residues) from each precursor (FIG. 4b,c). The antimicrobial properties of the θ-defensins are similar to those of the α-defensins, but their antiviral properties are greatly enhanced, as discussed below.

### Bacteria fight back

Bacteria have sparred with defensins and other endogenous antimicrobial peptides for more than 100 million years, so it is not surprising that some bacteria have become successful in resisting one or more of these compounds. Microbial resistance to antimicrobial peptides was initially investigated with the mouse pathogen *Salmonella enterica* serovar Typhimurium (*S. typhimurium*). Given the absence of defensins in mouse PMNs and macrophages, this could have been a whimsical choice; but it is one that turned out well because it contributed to identification of the PhoP–PhoQ regulon. This two-component ‘master regulatory’ system controls the ability of *S. typhimurium* to cause lethal infection in mice. It also regulates the adaptation of *S. typhimurium* to low Mg²⁺ concentrations and its resistance to various antimicrobial peptides, including α-defensins from rabbit PMNs and the Paneth cells of mice and rats. PhoP and PhoQ activate the transcription of genes that enhance *S. typhimurium* resistance to cationic antimicrobial peptides in macrophage phagosomes. One such gene, *pagB*, forms an operon with *pmrAB*, the gene products of which promote resistance to several antimicrobial polypeptides including polymyxin, azurocidin (CAP37), BPI/CAP57, protamine and polylysine. However, expression of PmrA or PmrB is not responsible for the increased sensitivity of PhoP-null mutants to the NP-1 defensin, which is present in rabbit alveolar macrophages.

Peschel and associates have identified several factors that contribute to *Staphylococcus aureus* resistance to α-defensins and other antimicrobial peptides. The net positive charge of defensins enhances their ability to bind to bacterial membranes, which typically have a net negative charge due to a high phosphatidylglycerol and cardiolipin content. An *mprF* mutant of *S. aureus* was shown to be killed more rapidly by human neutrophils and had attenuated virulence in mice compared with wild-type *S. aureus*. Subsequent studies identified

Both of these factors could contribute to the resistance of *N. gonorrhoeae* to killing by PMNs. This might explain why gonococci that appear intact are frequently found inside neutrophils in the urethral smears of subjects with gonococcal urethritis⁹⁹. In addition, gonococcal susceptibility to the cathelicidin hCAP-18/LL-37 is modulated by the energy-dependent Mtr efflux system⁹⁰, providing yet another way that gonococci survive the antimicrobial effects of PMNs.

### Human β-defensins

HBD-1 is present at nanomolar concentrations in human plasma, and was first isolated from the blood filtrates of patients undergoing haemodialysis for renal failure⁴⁹. It is constitutively expressed by many epithelial cells, particularly those of the pancreas and kidney⁹¹. In the kidney, its expression is restricted to the collecting ducts and loops of Henle⁹², which are sites that often contain low concentrations of salt. Relatively large concentrations of renal HBD-1 (up to 100 μg L⁻¹) are released into the tubular lumen as pro-HBD-1 peptides of 47 amino acids. These peptides undergo additional proteolytic processing into multiple shorter forms⁵³,⁹³. Recombinant and natural forms of HBD-1 that contain 36, 39 or 42 amino acids have been shown to have antimicrobial activity against laboratory and clinical strains of *Escherichia coli* at micromolar concentrations⁶⁷. This activity was not significantly altered by low-pH conditions, but was inhibited by high salt concentrations. Pancreatic HBD-1 is expressed in the acini, rather than in the ducts⁹², and is therefore likely to be present in pancreatic secretions. The presence of a potent, low-molecular-weight antimicrobial peptide was reported in canine pancreatic secretions, but its identity was not established⁹⁴. The closely related mouse homologue of HBD-1, mBD-1, is also expressed at high levels in the mouse kidney and at lower levels in many other tissues⁹⁵.

HBD-2 was initially purified from shed skin⁵²,⁹⁶ of patients with psoriasis, a cutaneous disorder in which staphylococcal infection is rare. HBD-2 expression is induced when epithelial cells come into contact with microorganisms or with proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1β. The acute and chronic skin lesions of patients with atopic dermatitis have reduced concentrations of HBD-2 and hCAP-18 (REF. 97), as well as reduced expression of HBD-3, IL-8 and iNOS⁹⁸. These deficiencies might result from a local cytokine imbalance — a predominance of T₂ cytokines and a deficiency of TNF-α and interferon-γ (IFN-γ)⁸⁸ — that could explain the frequency of *S. aureus* skin infections in patients with atopic dermatitis.

HBD-3 was also isolated from shed human psoriatic skin⁵¹ and is the product of a gene that is located 13-kb upstream of the *HBD-2* gene⁹⁹. Considerable amounts of HBD-3 mRNA are also expressed in the tonsils¹⁰⁰. HBD-3 has broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity — it is active against many Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, including multidrug-resistant *S. aureus*, vancomycin-resistant *Enterococcus faecium* and fungi⁵¹,¹⁰¹. However, *Burkholderia cepacia* is resistant to HBD-3.

duration of a cold, or prevents subsequent super-  
infection by opportunistic bacteria is unknown. As  
HIV-1 markedly enhances the expression of HBD-2 and  
HBD-3 mRNA by normal human oral epithelial cells  
in vitro and in vivo<sup>106,107</sup>, this might be a general response  
to viral infection.

Many other human β-defensins have been discovered  
by database mining, but as yet little is known about their  
functions. HBD-4 is expressed by cells of the testis,  
stomach, uterus, thyroid, lung, kidneys and neutrophils.  
HBD-5 and -6 are only expressed by epididymis cells.  
The human EP2 gene codes for at least nine message  
variants, all of which are specifically expressed in the  
epididymis<sup>108</sup>. This gene has two promoters, eight exons  
and seven introns. Exons 3 and 6 encode peptide  
sequences with homology to β-defensins. This homol-  
ogy and the arrangement of the gene indicate that the  
EP2 gene evolved from tandem ancestral β-defensin  
genes that each contributed one promoter and two  
exons, one exon of which encodes a leader sequence and  
the other a β-defensin. In support of this hypothesis, the  
EP2 gene is located adjacent to the defensin gene cluster  
on chromosome 8p23, within 100 kb of the HBD-2  
gene. In addition to β-defensin mRNA, EP2 transcripts  
encode other peptides, indicating that the EP2 gene  
product acquired new functions, perhaps related to  
sperm maturation or storage<sup>108</sup>.

Rodriguez-Jimenez *et al.* recently described five  
human β-defensin genes (DEFB25–DEFB29) clustered  
on chromosome 20p13 (REF. 109). The transcripts were  
expressed in few organs, with the highest abundance  
observed in the male genital tract. Real-time RT-PCR  
revealed that these defensins are expressed in function-  
ally different segments of the epididymal duct. *In situ*  
hybridization for one cDNA showed that it is restricted  
to the epithelial cell layer, which secretes factors that are  
responsible for sperm maturation. While spermatozoa  
traverse the proximal regions of the epididymis, they  
bind various proteins and acquire motility and fertiliz-  
ing ability. Human β-defensin 118 (DEFB118) is a  
potent antimicrobial peptide that binds to sperm, and  
might provide protection from microorganisms in the  
sperm ducts<sup>110</sup>.

The mouse genome contains nine clustered  
β-defensin genes, the expression of which is restricted  
to distinct regions of the epididymis<sup>111</sup>. Both α- and  
β-defensins are found in the rat testis or epididymis<sup>112,113</sup>.  
The rat epididymis also expresses a 28-kDa protein that  
contains a lectin domain and a β-defensin domain<sup>114</sup>, as  
well as a potent antimicrobial β-defensin called Bin1b,  
which can bind to immature sperm and induce motility  
and maturation<sup>115</sup>. These unexpected but important  
functions of Bin1b provide an appropriate transition to  
the next subject — the many properties of defensins.

### More than antimicrobial

Although their antimicrobial properties are the focus of  
much research on defensins, additional activities have  
also been ascribed to these molecules (FIG.5). α-defensins  
are not usually expressed by mammalian mononuclear  
phagocytes, yet rabbit alveolar macrophages contain

cysteine residues (CC) are shown in orange. Regions of the

amine and a marker of mast-cell degranulation. The granules of human and mouse mast cells also contain β-defensins and cathelicidins<sup>134</sup>, as well as an array of serine proteases<sup>135,136</sup>, some of which are chemotactic for neutrophils<sup>137</sup>.

Human α-defensins interact with complement<sup>138</sup>, although the effects of this interaction are unclear. Prohaszka *et al.* purified HNP-1–3 from human neutrophils and used a solid-phase immunoassay to assess their ability to activate complement<sup>139</sup>. They reported that the immobilized defensins bound Clq and triggered the classical pathway of complement activation. Reduced and alkylated defensins had markedly reduced Clq binding ability but still activated complement<sup>139</sup>. These investigators concluded that immobilized defensins interact with complement via both Clq-dependent and Clq-independent mechanisms.

van den Berg *et al.* also studied this interaction, and confirmed that HNP-1 could bind Clq<sup>140</sup>. However, fluid-phase HNP-1 inhibited activation of the classical complement pathway, as shown by its inhibition of Clq-dependent haemolytic activity. Could fluid-phase and immobilized HNPs react differently with complement? This remains to be investigated, as does the possibility that defensins (especially those that are lectins<sup>24,141</sup>) can trigger the lectin-mediated pathway of complement activation<sup>142,143</sup>.

α-defensins can exert cytotoxic<sup>144–147</sup> or growth-promoting<sup>148–152</sup> effects. Cytotoxic effects typically occur only at high ratios of defensin:target cell and under serum-free conditions. The inhibitory effect of serum is attributable to the fact that it contains many defensin-binding molecules<sup>153,154</sup>. Using mannitol permeability as a sensitive marker of epithelial barrier integrity, human (HNP-1–3) and rabbit (NP-1) α-defensins were shown to slowly disrupt the permeability barrier that is formed by confluent Madin–Darby canine kidney-cell epithelial monolayers without inducing measurable cytotoxicity<sup>155</sup>. Neither dextran sulphate nor heparin were found to inhibit this effect, but the presence of fetal bovine serum did. It has recently been shown that HNP-1–3 can bind fetuin, which is the main glycoprotein in fetal calf serum, with high affinity<sup>141</sup>, which can explain one of these findings, and it has also been observed that neither heparin nor dextran sulphate is effective in binding HNP-1–3 (R.I.L., unpublished observations), which might explain the other.

In airway epithelial cell cultures, HNP-1–3 caused a dose- and time-dependent increase in the rate of wound closure and increased levels of cell migration. This enhanced wound repair seemed to require activation of the epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream signalling pathways that are associated with various kinases<sup>149</sup>.

HNP-1 and -2 were shown to be chemotactic *in vitro* for human monocytes 15 years ago<sup>156</sup>. The magnitude of the peak response obtained with 5 nM HNP-1 was approximately half that obtained with 10 nM FMLP (formylmethionyl-leucine-proline). More recently, human α-defensins were reported to induce migration by certain human T lymphocytes, including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells

and naive (CD45RA⁺) CD4⁺ T cells. Memory (CD45RO⁺) CD4⁺ T cells did not respond to these defensins. Human α-defensins also recruited immature human dendritic cells (DCs) derived from CD34⁺ progenitors or peripheral blood monocytes¹⁵⁷,¹⁵⁸. The chemotactic effects of human α-defensins were sensitive to pertussis toxin, implicating a G-protein-coupled receptor in the response. Their ability to mobilize T cells and immature DCs could allow these defensins to accelerate and magnify the induction of adaptive immune responses.

HBD-2 is chemotactic for DCs¹⁵⁹ and T cells¹⁵⁹ and for neutrophils that are treated with TNF-α¹⁶⁰. In each case, HBD-2 acts by binding to CCR6, a pertussis-toxin-sensitive G-protein-coupled receptor for which the normal ligand is the chemokine MIP-3α. Mouse β-defensin 2 acts like an endogenous ligand for Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) on immature DCs, and induces DC maturation¹⁶¹. HBD-2 also induces mast-cell migration through a G protein-phospholipase C signalling pathway, apparently by a receptor other than CCR6 (REF. 162).

The ability of α- and β-defensins to mobilize monocytes, mast cells, immature DCs, lymphocytes and cytokine-activated neutrophils provides many mechanisms by which they can influence and amplify antimicrobial immunity. The same is true of the ability of defensins to enhance production of IL-8 (REFS 163–165) and leukotriene B4 (REF. 165), and to cause mast-cell degranulation. Cryptdins 2 and 3 (mouse intestinal α-defensins) form anion-conductive pores in eukaryotic cell membranes and induce mouse intestinal cells to secrete IL-8 by activating NF-κB and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner¹⁶⁶.

Although HBD-2 and MIP-3α are both cationic peptides with intramolecular disulphide bonds, their sequences and three-dimensional structures differ markedly. Does HBD-2 bind CCR6 because it is a lectin and CCR6 is a glycoprotein? Is MIP-3α also a lectin, with carbohydrate preferences that overlap those of HBD-2? Given the increasing convergence of the properties of defensins and certain chemokines³¹,¹⁶⁷,¹⁶⁸, such possibilities deserve consideration. Defensins have immuno-enhancing properties¹⁵⁸,¹⁶⁹–¹⁷². The combined administration of defensins with antigens can enhance cellular and humoral immune responses and increase cytokine production. In addition, linking defensins to weak tumour antigens increased the magnitude of the resulting immune response¹⁷³. It is also interesting, considering the widespread use of mycobacterial antigens as immunoadjuvants, that mycobacterial components stimulate production of HBD-1 by pulmonary epithelial cells¹⁷⁴.

### Antiviral properties and glycan binding

Several antiviral effects of α-defensins were described in 1985 (for rabbit NP-1 and -2)¹⁷⁵ and in 1986 (for HNP-1–3)¹⁷⁶. The latter report showed that herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2, cytomegalovirus, vesicular stomatitis virus and influenza A virus that were preincubated with HNP-1–3 lost their ability to infect target cells. However, two non-enveloped viruses, echovirus type 11 and reovirus type 3, that were treated in the same way retained their infectivity. The activity of HNP-1 against HSV-1 could be abrogated by eliminating the intramolecular disulphide bonds of the peptide, or by adding serum to the incubation mixtures.
The mechanism of action of NP-1 against HSV-2 was recently studied in detail<sup>177</sup>. NP-1 does not prevent viral envelope glycoproteins from binding to the heparan sulphate receptors of the host cell; however, it does prevent viral entry, virus-mediated fusion events and cell-to-cell spread. Experiments with human α-defensins and HSV-2 provided further insights<sup>24</sup>. Temperature-shift experiments indicated that retrocyclin 2 (which is a θ-defensin, discussed below) and HNP-1–3 protected human cells from infection with HSV-2 by different mechanisms. Glycoprotein B2 (gB2) of HSV-2 has an essential role, analogous to that of gp120 in HIV-1, in allowing HSV-2 to attach to and then enter a target cell<sup>178</sup>. We found that HNP-1–3 bound immobilized gB2 with relatively high affinity ($K_{d} = 30–60$ nM). Although these α-defensins did not prevent HSV-2 from binding to heparan sulphate-like cell-surface receptors<sup>179</sup>, they nevertheless prevented early viral post-entry events. By contrast, the θ-defensin was shown to bind gB2 ($K_{d} = 13.3$ nM) and block virus attachment to the cell. Even when retrocyclin was added late — during the binding or penetration phases of HSV-2 infection — it markedly reduced the amount of virus that entered the host cell<sup>177</sup>.

Removing the O-linked glycans of immobilized gB2 reduced the amount of bound θ- and α-defensins by at least 50%, removing the sialic acids decreased binding by two-thirds and removing the O-linked and N-linked glycans virtually abolished binding. The ability of defensins to bind the glycans of gB2 was not only due to their positive charge, because several analogues of retrocyclin that have the same net charge but which are composed exclusively of D-amino acids are neither protective nor able to bind gB2 effectively. These findings (and much additional data) show that many α- and θ-defensins are lectins<sup>24,141,180</sup> — molecules that can bind carbohydrates. Recent data indicate that HBD-2 and -3 are also lectins, indicating that carbohydrate recognition and binding could be fundamental properties of defensins (R.I.L., unpublished observations).

The ability to recognize and bind carbohydrates is not unique to mammalian defensins. Ac-AMP1 and Ac-AMP2 are antimicrobial peptides isolated from seeds of the amaranth plant (*Amaranthus caudatus*)<sup>181</sup>. Other than the presence of one additional residue at the carboxyl terminus of Ac-AMP2 (30 residues), the amino acid sequences of these peptides are identical. Both sequences contain a cysteine- and glycine-rich chitin-binding domain and bind reversibly to chitin, which is a structural polysaccharide found in fungal cell walls and the exoskeleton of insects. Both peptides also inhibit the growth of plant pathogenic fungi, and have some activity against Gram-positive bacteria. Many other antifungal peptides with chitin-binding (hevein-like<sup>182</sup>) domains are produced by other plants<sup>183,184</sup>.

Horseshoe crabs are marine invertebrates that are closely related to terrestrial spiders. Their leukocytes (haemocytes) morphologically resemble PMNs, and contain two types of cytoplasmic granules. The smaller granules contain numerous antimicrobial polypeptides, including tachyplesins<sup>185</sup> (protegrin-like peptides<sup>83</sup>), a ‘big defensin’<sup>186</sup> and tachycitin<sup>187</sup>, an antimicrobial peptide that inhibits Gram-negative bacteria, Gram-positive bacteria and fungi. Tachycitin also agglutinates bacteria and synergizes with big defensin. Tachycitin contains 73 residues and five disulphide bonds. The 28 residues at the N-terminus have sequence homology to antifungal chitin-binding peptides from plants. Tachycitin binds reversibly to chitin, a polymer of N-acetylglucosamine, but does not bind cellulose, mannan, xylan or laminarin.

‘Big defensin’ comprises 79 residues in two distinct functional domains<sup>186</sup>. It strongly inhibits Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, as well as *Candida albicans*. The 37-residue carboxy-terminal domain has sequence identity to mammalian α-defensins (especially of rats), but its disulphide connectivity is identical to that found in β-defensins. Its 35-residue amino-terminal domain is hydrophobic, and it displays potent activity against Gram-positive bacteria after separation from the defensin domain. By contrast, the defensin domain is more potent against Gram-negative bacteria. Like primate β-defensins, ‘big defensin’ is expressed in many tissues of the horseshoe crab<sup>188</sup>.

Horseshoe crab haemocytes also contain at least five lectins<sup>187</sup>. Tachylectin-1 binds to polysaccharides with broad specificity. Tachylectin-2 recognizes staphylococcal lipoteichoic acids and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) from several Gram-negative bacteria. This 236-amino-acid protein specifically binds N-acetylglucosamine and contains five almost identical carbohydrate-binding sites, one in each β-sheet<sup>189</sup>. Tachylectins-3 and -4 specifically bind to S-type LPS from several Gram-negative bacteria. Tachylectin-5 is a potent bacterial agglutinin that recognizes molecules containing acetyl groups<sup>187</sup>. Multivalency, such as that of tachylectin-2, facilitates the ability to recognize pathogens, because the surface ligands are typically present at high density. A smaller antimicrobial peptide, such as a mammalian defensin, could achieve multivalency by forming dimers or higher-order oligomers — an intrinsic property of at least some α-defensins<sup>190</sup> and β-defensins<sup>191</sup>.

Is the ability of defensins to recognize carbohydrates important for their antimicrobial properties? Although this remains to be explored in detail, readers of this journal will appreciate that capsular polysaccharides, or S-layers, contribute to the pathogenicity of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria such as *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *K. pneumoniae*, and of fungi such as *Cryptococcus neoformans*. Polymerized carbohydrates such as mannans, chitins and peptidoglycans are integral components of fungal and bacterial cell walls, and lipid A (a complex glycolipid) is an invariant component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria. An ability to reversibly bind microbial glycolipids or glycoproteins should allow defensins to achieve high local concentrations close to their preferred target — the microbial membrane. As rabbit NP-1 and NP-2 are potent lectins (R.I.L., unpublished observations), this property could contribute to their ability to opsonize *K. pneumoniae* for ingestion by rabbit alveolar macrophages<sup>116</sup>.The antiviral properties of defensins were included in this review mainly to illustrate that many defensins have lectin-like properties. Before leaving this topic, I will also discuss the potential role of defensins in host defence against HIV-1. Human α-defensins were reported to protect cells from infection by HIV-1 in 1993 (REF. 192), but this observation attracted little attention until a report entitled ‘Contribution of human α-defensin 1, 2, and 3 to the anti-HIV-1 activity of CD8 antiviral factor’ was published in 2000 (REF. 193). Zhang and co-authors had been attempting to identify CAF, a factor secreted by the CD8⁺ T cells of untreated HIV-infected patients whose HIV-1 infection remains stable without antiretroviral therapy for long periods of time¹⁹⁴. These patients (known as long-term non-progressors, LTNPs) can be contrasted to HIV-exposed seronegative (ESN) patients who are highly exposed to HIV-1 but remain seronegative and presumably uninfected. ESNs and LTNPs are of considerable interest because they might provide insights into how the immune system can prevent HIV-1 infection (ESNs) or control it once it occurs (LTNPs). CAF was defined operationally as a soluble non-lytic factor, derived from CD8⁺ T cells, that can inhibit HIV replication in cultured CD4⁺ T cells by a non-MHC-restricted mechanism¹⁹⁴. A common view is that CAF might be a mixture of molecules, including β-chemokines, that compete with gp120 for binding to its co-receptors on CD4⁺ T cells.

Zhang *et al.* cultured the CD8⁺ T cells of several LTNPs and found three peptides in the supernatant that seemed to fit the canonical description of CAF¹⁹³. When they identified these peptides as the α-defensins HNP-1–3 and suggested that they accounted for ‘much of the anti-HIV-1 activity of CAF that was not attributable to β-chemokines’, much controversy ensued¹⁹⁵. Eventually the authors issued a ‘retraction of interpretation’¹⁹⁶ in which they reiterated that cultured CD8⁺ T cells contained α-defensins and that α-defensins are active against HIV-1, but conceded that their cultured CD8⁺ cells did not contain any defensin mRNA. Evidently, the defensin-containing CD8⁺ cells obtained ‘second-hand’ defensins that had been synthesized by cells in their feeder layers. To some, this might seem an exciting and potentially important discovery, rather than a finding to be clothed in the sackcloth of retraction. Leaving aside the possibility that CAF may or may not actually exist¹⁹⁷, what remains undisputed is that α-defensins exist in CD8⁺ T cells, and that these α-defensins are active against HIV-1. The activity of HNPs against HIV-1 has been confirmed by work in other laboratories¹⁴¹,¹⁹⁸.

The mechanism of action of HNP was recently compared to a putative CAF produced by herpesvirus saimiri-transformed CD8⁺ T cells. This putative CAF inhibited HIV-1 RNA transcription, particularly at the stage of long terminal repeat (LTR)-driven gene expression, and mediated this inhibitory effect through STAT1 activation. Its antiviral properties differed in many respects from those of HNP-1, and for this, and other reasons, the authors concluded that α-defensins were not CAF.

What about the role of defensins in ESNs? Trabattoni *et al.*¹⁹⁹ examined α-defensin expression in peripheral blood and cervicovaginal mononuclear cells, and in cervical biopsies taken from three groups of women: 9 ESNs, 10 HIV-infected patients and 13 low-risk healthy controls (HCs). This paper is worth reading, even though a few of the results were obtained after 72 h of culture in the presence of an irradiated feeder layer. Freshly isolated CD8⁺ T cells from peripheral blood mononuclear cells were obtained at 99% purity, as measured by flow cytometry. Both fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and quantitative enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) indicated that the rate of constitutive production of HNP-1–3 by CD8⁺ T cells was >10-fold higher in ESNs than in the low-risk HCs. The CD8⁺ T cells of ESNs contained about twice as much α-defensin mRNA as did the same cells from low-risk HCs. The authors commented that ‘It is tempting to speculate that the increased concentration of these molecules seen in exposed seronegative individuals could contribute to their apparent resistance to infection.’ With respect to the 10-fold difference found between ESNs and HCs, they commented that ‘This finding may be due to the fact that ESNs are repeatedly exposed to HIV, and may therefore be an index of immune activation, or it could be genetically predetermined (that is, a genetically determined potent production of α-defensin is associated with ESN status)’.

As it happens, there is evidence that the number of defensin genes can vary markedly between individuals. Copy number polymorphism has been reported for the genes that encode HNP-1–3 (REF. 200) and for the genes that encode at least three HBDs — *DEFB4*, *DEFB103* and *DEFB104* (REF. 201). HBD-4 (the product of *DEFB104*) and HBD-1–3 are most highly expressed in the testis⁵⁰ but are also expressed in the uterine endometrium (REFS 202,203). HBD-3 mRNA expression is highest during the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle, and HBD-4 mRNA concentrations are highest in the proliferative phase²⁰². Somatic-cell hybrid mapping has shown that individuals inherit versions of chromosome 8 that have different numbers of HNP gene copies²⁰⁰ and that contain 1–8 copies of the repeated unit that contains the gene for HBD-4. Analysis of RNA from different individuals showed a significant correlation between the genomic copy number of *DEFB4* and the levels of its mRNA transcript²⁰¹, so such copy number polymorphisms could have important consequences for immune system function. The same could be said about defensin gene sequence polymorphisms, which have only been studied recently²⁰⁴,²⁰⁵. On the basis of these considerations, it would be premature to exclude defensins as contributors to HIV-1 resistance in the male or female genitourinary tracts.

I conclude this review with a short discussion of θ-defensins, the only circular peptides of mammalian origin that are currently known. These peptides were described five years ago by Selsted and associates, who purified a rhesus θ-defensin (RTD-1) from the leukocytes of rhesus monkeys⁶⁹. Subsequently, RTD-2 and -3 were
purified from rhesus leukocytes<sup>70</sup> and bone marrow<sup>68</sup>. As described above, rhesus leukocytes create these peptides by splicing two nonapeptide segments, each of which is derived from a separate propeptide<sup>69</sup>. DEFT genes are mutated α-defensin genes that evidently arose in an Old World monkey because DNA from several prosimians and New World monkeys lacks rhesus DEFT homologues<sup>206</sup>. Although rhesus θ-defensins have modest antimicrobial properties<sup>68–70</sup>, some can protect cells from infection by viruses, including HIV-1 (REFS 22,23,29,141), HSV-1 (REF. 24) and HSV-2 (REF. 24), as described above. The solution structure of RTD-1 has been reported<sup>207</sup>, and the molecule proved to be surprisingly flexible, especially given its three intramolecular disulphide bonds. The interactions of RTD-1 with model lipid bilayers have also been examined, and showed a remarkable predilection for the peptide to remain on the bilayer surface without inserting into its apolar acyl chain domain<sup>208</sup>. This property might explain the unusually low cytotoxicity of many θ-defensins and their modest antimicrobial properties.

Humans, chimpanzees and gorillas do not express θ-defensins because their DEFT genes acquired a mutation that introduced a premature stop codon into the signal sequence<sup>206</sup>. However, at least one of the human DEFT genes is still transcribed, because its mRNA transcripts are present in bone marrow, spleen, thymus, testis and skeletal muscle<sup>22</sup>. Retrocyclins-1–3 are chemically produced θ-defensins with sequences that are based on those found in human DEFT mRNA and pseudogenes; retrocyclin-2 is the most active of these peptides against HSV-2 (REF. 24) and HIV-1 (REFS 141,180).

The human lineage lost the ability to produce θ-defensins between 7.5 and 10 million years ago, when it diverged from the orangutans<sup>206</sup>. Consequently, it is unlikely, but not impossible, that humans have retained or regained the ability to express these unusual peptides. Even so, the elegantly simple structure of θ-defensins and the ability to synthesize them could allow them to be reintroduced in the future as topical or systemic antiviral therapeutics.
