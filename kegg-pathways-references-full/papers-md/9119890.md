Arg<sup>8</sup>-vasopressin (AVP) is a potent inducer of myogenic differentiation stimulating the expression of myogenic regulatory factors. To understand the mechanism of its effect on myogenesis, we investigated the early signals induced by AVP in myogenic target cells. In the rat skeletal muscle cell line L6, AVP selectively stimulates phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) and phosphatidylcholine (PtdCho) breakdown, through the activation of phospholipases C and D (PLC, PLD), as shown by the generation of Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> and phosphatidylethanol (PtdEtOH), respectively. AVP induces the biphasic increase of sn-1,2-diacylglycerol (DAG) consisting in a rapid peak followed by a sustained phase, and the monophasic generation of phosphatidic acid (PA). Propranolol (a PA phosphatase inhibitor) and Zn<sup>2+</sup> (a PLD inhibitor), abolish the sustained phase of DAG generation. Our data indicate that PtdIns-PLC activity is mainly responsible for the rapid phase of AVP-dependent DAG generation, whereas the sustained phase is dependent upon PtdCho-PLD activity and PA dephosphorylation, ruling out any significant role of DAG kinase. Modifications of PA level correlate with parallel changes of PLC activity, indicating a possible cross-talk between the two signal transduction pathways in the intact cell. PLD activation is elicited at AVP concentrations two orders of magnitude lower than those required for PLC activation. The differentiation of L6 myoblasts into multinucleated fibers is stimulated significantly by AVP at concentrations at which PLD, but not PLC, is activated. These data provide the first evidence for an important role of PLD in the mechanism of AVP-induced muscle differentiation. J. Cell. Physiol. 171:34–42, 1997. © 1997 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

The neurohypophyseal hormone AVP induces various biological effects in target cells by activating different signal transduction pathways (Bocckino et al., 1987; Welsh et al., 1990; Vinggaard and Hansen, 1992). AVP recently was shown in this laboratory to be a potent inducer of myogenic differentiation stimulating the expression of myogenic regulatory factors such as myogenin and myf-5 (Nervi et al., 1995b). Skeletal myogenic cells possess V<sub>1</sub> AVP receptors (Wakelam et al., 1987), and we have shown that their occupancy leads to the rapid production of Ins(1,4,5)P<sub>3</sub> followed by a biphasic increase of intracellular calcium concentration and changes of intracellular pH (Teti et al., 1993).

The PtdIns breakdown response is generally [and specifically in AVP-stimulated myogenic cells (Teti et al., 1993)] very fast but transient. The possibility that long-term responses, such as proliferation and differentiation, are mediated only by such transient intracellular signals has been questioned (Exton, 1994). Conversely, PtdCho-PLD activity generates PA and is likely to produce DAG to a greater extent and for longer time periods than accounted for by PLC-dependent PtdIns turnover (Cockcroft, 1992; Exton, 1994). AVP, like other calcium mobilising agonists, induces

PLD dependent PtdCho hydrolysis in Leydig cells, smooth muscle cells, and hepatocytes (Bocckino et al., 1987; Welsh et al., 1990; Vinggaard and Hansen, 1992). We and other authors recently reported that AVP induces, in skeletal myogenic cells, PtdCho-hydrolysis exclusively by activation of PLD without the intervention of phospholipases A or C (Thompson et al., 1994; Nervi et al., 1995a).

The relative role of PtdIns-PLC and PtdCho-PLD signal transduction pathways to the induction of myogenesis by AVP (Nervi et al., 1995b), as well as the interaction between the two pathways, is still unknown. In the present study, we show a remarkably higher sensitivity to AVP of PtdCho-PLD than PtdIns-PLC to AVP stimulation, a biphasic production of DAG, and the interactions between PLC-dependent PtdIns turnover and PLD-dependent PtdCho turnover. Furthermore AVP dose response studies indicate a close correlation between induction of differentiation and activation of PLD.

PHOSPHOLIPASE D AND MYOGENESIS

MATERIALS AND METHODS

**Materials**

Sources for materials were: Hi-Clone Europe (Cramlington, England) provided Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Dulbecco and Freeman, 1959) and fetal bovine serum (FBS); Du Pont de Nemours (Milano, Italy) supplied D-myo-[³H]inositol (spec. act. 500 GBq/mmol), [³H]choline chloride (spec. act. 3 Tbq/mmol), and Ins(1,4,5)P₃ radioreceptor assay; and Amer sham Italia (Milano, Italy) provided [9,10(n)-[³H]- myristic acid (spec. act. 2 Tbq/mmol), [1-¹⁴C] arachidonic acid (spec. act. 2 Gbq/mmol), and DAG assay system. Tissue culture grade BSA was obtained from Boehringer Mannheim (Milano, Italy). DL-propranolol, phospholipid and lipid standards, and chromatography resins came from Sigma Aldrich (Milano, Italy). TLC silica gel plates were from Merck (Darmstadt, Germany).

**Cell cultures**

Rat myogenic L6 cells (Yaffe, 1968) clone C5 (L6-C5) (Teti et al., 1993), were used routinely throughout this study. The cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 μg/ml streptomycin, 20 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N′-2-ethanesulfonic acid (HEPES), pH 7.4, and 10% FBS (culture medium). All experiments were conducted on subconfluent (70–85% confluence), undifferentiated cultures, between the 6th and the 15th passage. To induce L6-C5 differentiation, 24 h after plating, the culture medium was substituted with DMEM + 1% BSA (Ewton et al., 1994), the cells were treated with different concentrations of AVP and cultured for further 72 h. The percentage of fusion was assessed as reported (Nervi et al., 1995b).

**Radiolabelling and stimulation**

[³H]Ins and [³H]choline labelling. L6-C5 cells were seeded at 2.5–5 × 10⁴ cells/well into 12-well tissue culture plates. On the third day of culture, the medium was substituted with fresh medium containing either 185 kBq/ml [³H]Ins or 74 kBq/ml [³H]choline chloride, and the cells were cultured for further 48 h.

Fatty acid labelling. The cells were seeded into 6-cm tissue culture dishes at the initial density of 0.5–1 × 10⁴ cells/cm² and cultured as described. Subconfluent monolayers (~2 × 10⁶ cells/dish) were incubated for 3 h with 9.25 kBq/ml [³H]myristic acid and 4.6 kBq/ml [¹⁴C]arachidonic acid. After any of the described labelling protocols, the monolayers were washed repeatedly with Hank’s balanced salt solution (Ham, 1965) supplemented with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 0.1% BSA (HHB buffer), and the same buffer was used for agonist stimulation. The incubations were terminated by rapidly aspirating the incubation medium and by adding ice-cold methanol [or 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) for InsP determination]. For those experiments in which total (intracellular plus extracellular) [³H]- choline release was measured, the incubations were quenched by direct addition of 1 vol of ice-cold methanol to the incubation medium (Cook and Wakelam, 1989).

**Analysis of water-soluble choline metabolites**

The cells, scraped and transferred to polypropylene tubes, were extracted for 1 h at 4°C before chloroform and water were added to a final ratio of CHCl₃:MeOH:H₂O = 1:1:0.9 (v/v) (Cook and Wakelam, 1989). The upper aqueous-methanolic phase was subjected to chromatography on Dowex 50-WH⁺ as described by Cook and Wakelam (1989) to achieve separation of labelled glycerophosphocholine, phosphocholine, and choline (Nervi et al., 1995a).

**Measurement of InsP production**

[³H]Ins-labelled InsP were extracted, separated by ion exchange chromatography and counted as previously described (Teti et al., 1993). Alternatively, quantitative determination of Ins(1,4,5)P₃ mass was performed according to Challiss et al. (1988), using a specific commercial radioreceptor assay kit. Briefly, the cells were seeded and grown in 9-cm dishes and subconfluent monolayers were equilibrated for 30 min at 37°C in HHB buffer and stimulated for 5 s with different concentrations of AVP. The incubations were arrested by rapidly aspirating the medium and delivering ice-cold 15% TCA. The samples were scraped and centrifuged for 10 min at 2,500 g, and TCA was extracted with 1 vol of trichlorotrifluoroethane:tri-n-octylamine (3:1 v/v) (Teti et al., 1993). The extracts were employed in the radioreceptor assay as directed by the manufacturer.

**Phospholipid and lipid analysis**

Cells were scraped from the culture dishes in ice-cold methanol, and lipids were extracted by the method of Bligh and Dyer (1959): after addition of 1 vol of chloroform and 1 vol of 0.1 M KCl, the resulting aqueous and organic phases were separated by brief centrifugation in a clinical centrifuge. The lower phase was washed with synthetic upper phase (Bligh and Dyer, 1959), dried down under a stream of N₂, and analysed by TLC.

**Phospholipid analysis.** Samples, along with appropriate standards, were applied to silica gel 60 plates, preactivated for 60 min at 110°C. TLC plates were developed as reported (Baldini et al., 1992), obtaining complete separation of phospholipids.

**Lipid analysis.** DAG was separated by chromatography on 20 × 20 cm silica gel 60 plates, preactivated at 110°C. The solvent system was petroleum ether:diethyl ether:acetic acid (80:20:1, v/v) (Baldini et al., 1992) (DAG R<sub>F</sub> = 0.15–0.20). PA and PtdEtOH were separated as reported (Baldini et al., 1992). After development, the plates were air dried and exposed to iodine vapour. Under the conditions employed, PA had a R<sub>F</sub> = 0.3. The areas of interest were scraped off the plates, eluted with 200 μl of methanol, and counted after addition of 8 ml of scintillant.

**Transphosphatidylation reaction**

For determination of PLD activity, L6 cells, prelabelled with the radioactive fatty acid as described above, were incubated in the presence of 1% ethanol for 15 min at 37°C before hormone addition. PtdEtOH was separated as described above and identified as reported (Baldini et al., 1992).

**Quantification of DAG mass**

sn-1,2-DAG content of control and AVP-stimulated L6 cells was measured by incubating aliquots of cell lipid extracts with Escherichia coli DAG kinase as described (Preiss et al., 1986; Baldini et al., 1992).

Phospholipid labelling and metabolism

To investigate the AVP-dependent activation of PLC and PLD at the level of their lipid substrates and products, L6 cells were double labelled with \[^{14}C\]-arachidonic acid and \[^3H\]myristic acid. It is well known that the different classes of phospholipids contain characteristic ratios of these fatty acids. Therefore the \[^{14}C/\]^3H^ labelling ratio, indicative of the different distribution of fatty acyl chains among different phospholipids, allowed us to identify the parental molecule of the transient lipid second messengers (Horwitz, 1990; van Blitterswijk et al., 1991). Both labelled fatty acids were incorporated into the major classes of phospholipids (Table 1). PtdCho appears to be relatively enriched in \[^3H\]myristic acid (\[^{14}C/\]^3H^ ratio = 0.5, n = 18), compared with PtdIns, which is esterified prevalently with \[^{14}C\]-arachidonic acid (\[^{14}C/\]^3H^ ratio = 1.7, n = 19). No significant effect on other major phospholipids, namely phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine, or sphingomyelin was measurable after AVP treatment. PtdIns was reduced significantly in cells stimulated with AVP concentrations as high as 0.1 mM whereas a significant reduction of PtdCho occurred at AVP concentrations as low as 1 nM (Table 1). These data indicate that only PtdCho and PtdIns are modified after AVP stimulation and confirm the higher sensitivity to AVP of PtdCho breakdown compared with that of PtdIns.

AVP-dependent generation of PA and DAG

The production of PA, one of the two direct products of PtdCho-PLD activity, was investigated in \[^{14}C\]-arachidonic acid, \[^3H\]myristic acid double-labelled L6 cells stimulated with 0.1 μM AVP, a concentration that maximally induces L6 cell differentiation (Nervi et al., 1995a,b). Double-labelled PA, measured in this condition, (Fig. 2A) shows a kinetic pattern consisting of a rapid increase ≤1 min, followed by a slow decrease (compare with the continuing increase of PtdEtOH). Double labelled PA displays a \[^{14}C/\]^3H^ ratio (0.6 at 1 min) similar to that of PtdCho.

Time course analysis of DAG generation under the same experimental conditions employed for PA shows a very rapid peak occurring within a few seconds of AVP treatment, followed by a slower accumulation reaching a maximum at ~2 min of stimulation (Fig. 2B). The \[^{14}C/\]^3H^ labelling ratio of DAG produced in the two phases is different: the first peak shows a \[^{14}C/\]^3H^ labelling ratio of 1.0, intermediate between those of PtdIns and PtdCho, suggesting that PLC significantly contributes to this phase of DAG generation. Conversely, DAG produced during the second phase shows a label ratio close to 0.5, indicative of its origin from PtdCho. To investigate the contribution of PLC and PLD to the first phase of DAG generation, L6 cells, labelled with \[^3H\]myristic acid, were stimulated with increasing concentrations of AVP. The data reported in Fig. 2C indicate that stimulation of the production of “early” DAG (5 s of stimulation) requires higher AVP concentrations than those necessary for the stimulation of the generation of \[^3H\]PA (1 min of stimulation). These experiments suggest that “early” DAG derives from both PLC and PLD activities, whereas second phase DAG is entirely PtdCho-derived.

To confirm the origin of second phase DAG, proprano-

Fig. 2. AVP-dependent generation of PA, PtdEtOH, and DAG. L6 cells (~2 × 10⁶ cells/dish) were incubated for 3 h with 9.25 kBq/ml [9,10(n)-³H] myristic acid and 4.6 kBq/ml [1-¹⁴C] arachidonic acid, extensively washed and incubated for the times indicated in the absence (○, △) or in the presence (●, ▲, ■) of 0.1 μM AVP. The samples were analysed for: (A) PA, ³H cpm (○, ●) and ¹⁴C cpm (△, ▲). The generation of PtdEtOH is also shown, ³H cpm (■). B: DAG, ³H cpm (○, ●) and ¹⁴C cpm (△, ▲). C: L6 cells were incubated at 37°C with the indicated concentrations of AVP, and the incubations arrested after 5 s (for DAG analysis) or after 1 min (for PA analysis); ³H cpm (●). (D) L6 cells were incubated for 15 min with 0.1 mM propranolol, incubated for the times indicated in the absence (○, △) or in the presence (●, ▲) of 0.1 μM AVP, and the samples analysed for DAG; ³H cpm (○, ●) and ¹⁴C cpm (△, ▲).

lol, a specific inhibitor of PA phosphatase not affecting PLC and PLD activities (Billah et al., 1989; Jamal et al., 1991), was employed. [¹⁴C]arachidonic acid, [³H]-myristic acid double-labelled L6 cells were incubated with 0.1 mM propranolol 15 min before 0.1 μM AVP stimulation. Analysis of PA and DAG production under these conditions (Fig. 2D) reveals that, in the presence of propranolol: the first DAG peak shows a ¹⁴C/³H ratio (1.7 at 5 s) corresponding to that of PtdIns and the second peak is abolished completely despite the continuing accumulation of PA (not shown), indicating that it derives from PtdCho via PA.

It is presumable that, due to the abundance of PtdCho compared with PtdIns, the amount of DAG generated during the second phase should be conspicuous compared with PtdIns-PLC produced DAG. To clarify this point, the mass of DAG was measured in L6 cells at different times of AVP stimulation. Figure 3 shows

stimulated cells (Table 2), an effect likely due to the inhibition of the conversion of PA into DAG. The propranolol-induced increase of PA level in AVP-stimulated cells correlates with an increase of the level of “early” DAG enriched in arachidonic acid (compare Fig. 2, D with B) and a 20% increase of \[^3H\)Ins labelled inositol phosphate production (Table 2), suggesting that products of PLD modulate PLC activity. Therefore, to investigate the cross-talk between PtdIns and PtdCho turnover in intact cells, PLD activity was inhibited selectively using ZnCl₂. Zinc, at millimolar concentration, has been shown to be a specific inhibitor of PLD without affecting PtdIns-PLC activity (Welsh et al., 1990; Qian and Drewes, 1991). Metabolically labelled L6 cells were preincubated with 1 mM ZnCl₂ (or NiCl₂ as control), challenged with 0.1 μM AVP, and the generation of \[^3H\)InsP, \[^3H\)choline, and double-labelled DAG and PA was measured (Fig. 4, Table 3). The incubation of the cells with 1 mM NiCl₂ does not induce any modification of the AVP-dependent signal transduction pathways (not shown). Conversely, the presence of ZnCl₂ modifies the first peak of DAG increasing the \[^{14}C/\^3H\) ratio from 1 to 1.4 (very close to the PtdIns labelling ratio), whereas it almost abolishes the second phase of AVP-dependent DAG generation (Fig 4A) as well as PA production (Fig 4B). Analysis of water-soluble metabolites confirms zinc-dependent inhibition of PLD by the virtual lack of \[^3H\)choline increase after AVP stimulation (Table 3). In addition,

### AVP concentration dependency of L6 differentiation

The AVP concentration dependency of L6 myoblast fusion into myotubes, an important parameter of myogenic differentiation, was investigated under culture conditions similar to those employed for the analysis of the activation of signal transduction events, e.g., in the absence of interfering factors such as those supplied by FBS (Ewton et al., 1994). L6 cells, prepared as described under the Materials and Methods section, were incubated in the absence or in the presence of AVP (10 pM - 0.1 μM) for 72 h, then fixed and stained as reported (Nervi et al., 1995b). The data reported in Fig. 5 indicate that AVP induces L6 differentiation with an EC₅₀ ≈ 0.3 nM, very close to that of the induction of

PLD activation. Comparison of this curve with those reported in Fig. 1 indicates that L6 fusion into myotubes is significantly stimulated by AVP at concentrations not sufficient to activate PLC: these results strongly support the hypothesis that PLD mediates the AVP-dependent stimulation of myogenic differentiation.

---

### DISCUSSION

AVP induces in L6 cells, at the concentrations used to maximally stimulate myogenic differentiation in culture (Nervi et al., 1995a,b), the activation of two different signal transduction pathways, both capable of contributing to an increase of the intracellular level of DAG. DAG generation consists of two phases (Fig 2B): the first, rapid and transient, is kinetically coincident with the peak of Ins(1,4,5)P₃ measured with two different methods (Teti et al., 1993; Nervi et al., 1995a), suggesting that it derives from PtdIns-PLC activity. However, a contribution of PtdCho-PLD in “early” DAG generation is indicated by its ¹⁴C/³H labelling ratio, intermediate between those of PtdIns and of PtdCho. Moreover the kinetics of intracellular choline release (Nervi et al., 1995a), and the time course of PA and PtdEtOH production (Fig. 2A), indicate rapid PtdCho-PLD activation. The hypothesis that PtdCho-PLD contributes (via PA) to the first phase of DAG generation is further supported by the observations that inhibition of PA generation by Zn²⁺ (Fig. 4) and inhibition of PA conversion into DAG by propranolol (Fig. 2D) result in a modified ¹⁴C/³H labelling ratio. Conversely, the second phase of DAG generation appears to be entirely dependent on PtdCho-PLD activity (via PA-phosphatase). In fact, its labelling ratio corresponds to that of PtdCho;

Twenty-four hours after plating, this medium was replaced with DMEM supplemented with 1% BSA and the cells were incubated with the indicated concentrations of AVP for 72 h. The cultures were Wright's stained, and the percentage of fusion was measured. A: Control; B: 10 pM AVP; C: 100 pM AVP; D: 0.1 μM AVP; E: Percentage of fusion, expressed as percent of maximal response, for direct comparison with Fig. 1.

furthermore, this phase is abolished by either propranolol or Zn²⁺ treatment of the cells prior to AVP stimulation.

Experiments performed with propranolol demonstrate that PtdCho-PLD is responsible for the sustained production of PA, converted into DAG by a specific PA-phosphatase (Bocckino et al., 1987; Baldini et al., 1992) and argue against the hypothesis that, in our system, AVP-dependent PA generation is due to DAG conversion into PA by DAG kinase. Although PA accumulation precedes that of second phase DAG, PA could be derived from a rapidly phosphorylated pool of DAG. Experimental results show that PA has a labelling ratio equal to that of PtdCho, ruling out the possibility of a functional DAG-kinase, in agreement with what reported for AVP induction of PA in hepatocytes (Bocckino et al., 1987).

A specific role for PA as a second messenger has been proposed on the basis of several reports (reviewed by Exton 1994). It is worth mentioning that Wakelam (1983) reported a positive correlation between chick embryo myoblast differentiation and PA generation. In agreement with the hypothesis of other authors, our data show that endogenous PA modulates PtdIns-PLC activity (Welsh et al., 1990; Qian and Drewes, 1991; Jones and Carpenter, 1993), indicating a relationship between these two signal transduction pathways and a possible modulatory role for this molecule in the response of L6 cells to AVP. A mechanism for such interaction has been suggested by Jones and Carpenter (1993), who reported that PA activates PLC-γ1 acting as an allosteric modifier, possibly by lowering the Km of the enzyme for its substrate Ptd-Ins(4,5)P₂. This hypothesis is supported by the experiments performed using propranolol, where enhanced PA accumulation increases PLC activity. Furthermore, zinc-dependent inhibition of PtdIns-PLC activity (Fig. 4, Table 3) coincides with reduced generation of PA. These data, generated for the first time in intact cells, confirm those obtained in membranes prepared from cerebral cortex tissue and support the hypothesis that PtdCho-PLD products modulate the activity of PtdIns-PLC (Welsh et al., 1990; Qian and Drewes, 1991).

The mechanism by which AVP induces myogenic differentiation is not clear, although it appears that myogenin gene induction plays an important role in this process (Nervi et al., 1995b). To approach the problem of the relative contribution of PtdCho-PLD and PtdIns-PLC signalling pathways to the induction of myogenic differentiation, we have compared the AVP dose dependency and sensitivity of PLD activation closely correlate with those of the induction of L6 differentiation. DAG mass measurements, indicating that PtdCho-derived DAG is quantitatively predominant and generated for a prolonged time compared to PtdIns-derived DAG, support the hypothesis attributing to AVP-dependent PtdCho-PLD activity an important role in the ensuing long-term effect of AVP on myogenic differentiation. This hypothesis also is supported by the observation that significant stimulation of the expression of the myogenic regulatory factor myogenin is induced, in L6 cells, by 0.1 nM AVP (Nervi et al., 1995b), a concentration that significantly activates PLD-dependent PtdCho hydrolysis but not PLC-dependent PtdIns turnover. Induction of myogenic differentiation may be, at least in part, dependent upon activation of protein kinase C (PKC), a kinase that plays an important role in myogenesis (Adamo et al., 1989; Li et al., 1992; Osada et al., 1992). Ha and Exton (1993) have shown differential activation of PKC isoforms selectively induced by PLC and PLD activities. It is not possible to exclude that products of PLD activity could activate a “novel” or an “atypical” PKC isoform, which in turn could be responsible for the stimulation of myogenic differentiation.

The different sensitivity of the two phospholipases to AVP stimulation and the cross-talk between the two signal transduction pathways in intact cells represent novel findings, whose interest may be not limited to the myogenic cell model. In addition, our data argue for a role of products of PLD activation in AVP-induced myogenic differentiation possibly mediated by the activation of PKC isoforms not dependent upon PtdIns-PLC-derived second messengers.
