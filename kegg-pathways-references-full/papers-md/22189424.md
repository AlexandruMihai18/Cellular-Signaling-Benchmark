**Regulating the regulator: post-translational modification of RAS**

*Ian M. Ahearn*¹, *Kevin Haigis*², *Dafna Bar-Sagi*¹ and *Mark R. Philips*¹

Abstract | RAS proteins are monomeric GTPases that act as binary molecular switches to regulate a wide range of cellular processes. The exchange of GTP for GDP on RAS is regulated by guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which regulate the activation state of RAS without covalently modifying it. By contrast, post-translational modifications (PTMs) of RAS proteins direct them to various cellular membranes and, in some cases, modulate GTP–GDP exchange. Important RAS PTMs include the constitutive and irreversible remodelling of its carboxy-terminal CAAX motif by farnesylation, proteolysis and methylation, reversible palmitoylation, and conditional modifications, including phosphorylation, peptidyl-prolyl isomerisation, monoubiquitylation, diubiquitylation, nitrosylation, ADP ribosylation and glucosylation.

Costello syndrome  
A rare genetic disorder, similar  
to Noonan syndrome and  
cardio-facial-cutaneous  
syndrome, that is caused by  
an activating mutation in the  
gene encoding HRAS.

Noonan syndrome  
An autosomal-dominant  
congenital disease that results  
in various developmental  
defects, including, but not  
limited to, dwarfism, pulmonary  
valve stenosis and learning  
disabilities. More than half  
of the cases are caused by  
mutations in the gene encoding  
SHP2 and the others include  
gain-of-function mutations in  
the genes for KRAS or Son of  
sevenless homologue 1, placing  
Noonan syndrome in the  
RASopathy category.

The intense interest in the actions and regulation of  
RAS among cancer researchers and cell biologists can  
be traced to the recognition of v-ras genes as the trans-  
forming principle of tumour viruses¹ and the identi-  
fication of HRAS as the first oncogene isolated from a  
human tumour²⁻⁴. Recent analyses of cancer genomes  
have reconfirmed the central role of RAS as a driver of  
oncogenesis in several human tumours⁵. In addition,  
germline mutations in RAS genes have recently been  
recognized as the underlying cause of three develop-  
mental disorders, Costello syndrome⁶, Noonan syndrome⁷  
and cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome⁸, providing further  
links between RAS mutation and disease.

To cell biologists, RAS serves as the paradigm of a  
monomeric GTPase switch, a protein that exists in two  
states depending on the guanine nucleotide that it binds.  
As a binary switch, RAS regulates the flow of inform-  
ation down several signalling pathways (FIG. 1). Cell  
biologists have also devoted attention to RAS because  
it represents the archetypal CAAX protein. This class  
of protein terminates in a CAAX sequence, in which  
C is Cys, A is usually, but not always, an aliphatic amino  
acid and X is any amino acid. The CAAX sequence  
directs the post-translational modification (PTM) of  
the carboxyl terminus of the protein with a polyiso-  
prenoid lipid which, in the case of RAS, is a farnesyl  
moiety. This modification converts an otherwise globu-  
lar, hydrophilic protein to one that associates with the  
cytoplasmic leaflet of cellular membranes, a process that  
is required for RAS activation and signalling.

The first two decades of research into the cell biol-  
ogy of RAS were marked by an exponential growth  
in the understanding of how the exchange of GTP for  
GDP on this protein is regulated by guanine nucleotide  
exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase-activating proteins  
(GAPs) (FIG. 1a). We now know that GEFs activate RAS by  
inducing the release of GDP and permitting GTP bind-  
ing, whereas GAPs inactivate small GTPases like RAS  
by increasing their intrinsic rate of GTP hydrolysis to  
return the protein to the GDP-bound state. The effectors  
and downstream pathways regulated by RAS, as well as  
the enzymes that modify the C-terminal hypervariable  
region (HVR), which targets RAS to membranes, were  
also characterized⁹. More recent insights into RAS biol-  
ogy have been gained from experiments carried out  
in vivo and in cultured cells. For example, the generation  
of transgenic mice has confirmed what cell biologists and  
cancer geneticists already suspected: that there are sig-  
nificant biological differences between RAS isoforms¹⁰.  
Furthermore, although RAS was initially thought to be  
expressed on, and to signal exclusively from, the plasma  
membrane, live-cell imaging of fluorescently labelled  
RAS proteins has revealed that RAS traffics between  
various subcellular compartments, including the Golgi  
apparatus and endosomes, and that it is capable of signal-  
ling from multiple locations¹¹⁻¹⁴. It has become clear that  
PTMs control the localization of RAS proteins (BOX 1).  
These include both the modifications of the C-terminal  
HVRs of RAS, which have been studied for two decades,  
and the more recently appreciated RAS modifications,

Figure 1 | RAS signalling. **a** | The GDP–GTP cycle of RAS is shown. Inactive, GDP-bound RAS is activated by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), which induces the release of GDP and thereby permits GTP to bind. GTP loading induces a marked conformational change in RAS that allows it to bind effectors via their RAS-binding domains (RBDs). The ‘on’ state of RAS is limited by its slow intrinsic GTPase activity, which is accelerated up to 10<sup>5</sup>-fold by the binding of a GTPase-activating protein (GAP), allowing RAS to return to its inactive, GDP-bound state. **b** | The RAS–RAF1-extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway. This pathway is engaged by protein Tyr kinase receptors (PTKRs), which are activated by growth factor binding. The adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2) binds to activated (that is, phosphorylated) RTKs. GRB2 also binds the GEF Son of sevenless (SOS) and brings it to the membrane, where it can activate RAS. RAS initiates downstream signalling by bringing RAF1 to the membrane and activating its kinase activity. This is the best-characterized RAS-regulated pathway and it is frequently dysregulated in cancer. **c** | Multiplex regulation of, and signalling from, RAS. The various families of GEFs, GAPs and effectors that have been reported to regulate RAS or transmit signals from RAS·GTP are shown. CAPRI, calcium-promoted RAS inactivator; GAP1<sup>P4BP</sup>, GAP1 InsP<sub>4</sub>-binding protein; MEK, MAPK/ERK kinase; NF1, neurofibromin 1; PLCε, phospholipase Cε; PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; RALGDS, RAL guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator; RASAL, RASGAP-activating-like; RASGRF, RAS-specific guanyl-nucleotide-releasing factor; RASGRP, RAS-specific guanine-nucleotide-releasing protein; RASSF, RAS association domain-containing family; RIN1, RAS and RAB interactor 1; SYNGAP, synaptic RASGAP; TIAM1, T lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing 1.

Cardio-facio-cutaneous syndrome
A rare genetic disorder that is characterized by a distinctive facial appearance, congenital cardiac malformations and learning difficulties. Like Noonan syndrome, it is a RASopathy caused by gain-of-function mutations, but in this case in the genes encoding KRAS, BRAF or MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK).

Nitrosylation
The modification of a Cys side chain sulphhydryl group with a nitrosyl group derived from nitric oxide.

G domain
The first 169 amino acids of RAS proteins, which fold into a globular, hydrophilic protein that contains a guanine-nucleotide (G)-binding site.

Heterotrimeric G proteins
Members of the large subfamily of guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins that signal downstream of receptors that span the plasma membrane seven times. Composed of three subunits designated α, β and γ, of which the α-subunit binds nucleotide.

Each RAS protein is a 21 kDa guanine nucleotide binding protein with intrinsic GTPase activity and is therefore designated a small, or monomeric, GTPase, distinguishing RAS proteins from the α-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins. The conformation of one surface of RAS proteins, consisting of the switch I and switch II regions, changes radically when GTP is substituted for GDP in the guanine-nucleotide-binding pocket<sup>17</sup>. This is the physical basis for the molecular switch that is at the core of RAS as a regulatory machine. RAS proteins transduce signals by interacting with effectors only when in the GTP-bound conformation. Thus, on–off signalling through RAS is ultimately determined by the factors that initiate GTP–GDP exchange and those that affect its GTPase activity.

RAS proteins are activated by GEFs, eight of which are encoded in mammalian genomes<sup>15</sup>. These include two isoforms each of Son of sevenless (SOS) and RAS-specific guanyl-nucleotide-releasing factor (RASGRF), and four isoforms of RAS-specific guanine-nucleotide-releasing protein (RASGRP) (FIG. 1c). Each GEF contains a CDC25 homology region, which is the catalytic domain

RAS as a molecular switch
There are three RAS genes in mammalian genomes: HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS<sup>16</sup>. Because the transcript from the KRAS locus can be alternatively spliced, the three genes give rise to four protein isoforms: HRAS, NRAS, KRAS4A and KRAS4B. These proteins are >90% identical in the first 168–169 amino acids (known as the G domain) but differ in the C-terminal 20 amino acids, which are known as the HVR (FIG. 2a).

Box 1 | PTMs of RAS

Post-translational modification (PTM) of proteins is exceedingly common, according to Princeton’s Proteome-Wide PTM Statistics Curator. The purpose of PTM is to extend the complexity and function of proteins, which are constructed from only 20 amino acids. PTMs have numerous roles, ranging from allowing proper folding and localization, to signalling for protein senescence and degradation. Readily reversible PTMs, such as phosphorylation, are used extensively in signalling pathways as the ‘molecular currency’ that transmits information. It is therefore not surprising that a signalling molecule as important as RAS can be modified post-translationally in multiple ways, including by farnesylation, palmitoylation, methylation, peptidyl-prolyl isomerization, phosphorylation, nitrosylation, monoubiquitylation and diubiquitylation, as well as by proteolytic removal of a carboxy-terminal pro-peptide (FIG. 6).

The mechanism and function of each RAS PTM has been fairly well characterized. Farnesylpyrophosphate is a lipid intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and it is added to the CAAX Cys of RAS⁴⁴ by farnesyltransferase⁴⁵ via a stable thioether linkage. Palmitate, which is an abundant saturated (acyl) fatty acid that is used to modify many proteins, is added to one or two Cys residues immediately upstream of the RAS CAAX sequence⁵⁹ by one or more palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs)⁶² via a labile thioester bond. The reversal of this modification is catalysed by one or more thioesterases, such as acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1)⁷⁷. The AAX amino acids of the CAAX sequence are substrates for an endoprotease designated RAS-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1)⁵¹. Following RCE1-mediated proteolysis, the α-carboxyl group of the now C-terminal prenylcysteine of RAS is methylesterified by isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT)⁵². The Gly-Pro peptidyl-prolyl bond of HRAS at position 178–179 undergoes cis–trans isomerization catalysed by 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12)⁷⁹. Protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylates KRAS4B on Ser181 (REF. 82). Cys118, which is conserved in all RAS isoforms, functions as a redox indicator that can be nitrosylated⁹¹. Finally, HRAS and KRAS can be monoubiquitylated and diubiquitylated on several Lys residues⁸⁷,⁸⁸ by the E3 ligase rabaptin 5-associated exchange factor for RAB5 (RABEX5)⁸⁹. In addition to these endogenous PTMs, two pathogenic bacteria, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* and *Clostridium sordelli*, produce toxins that can ADP-ribosylate⁹⁶ or glucosylate⁹⁷ RAS.

RASGAP-activating-like (RASAL)²¹. RASGAPs function by stabilizing the transition state of the nucleophilic attack of water on GTP. They accomplish this by inserting an ‘Arg finger’ into the active site of the GTPase²². Oncogenic mutations of RAS, such as the prevalent Gly12Val mutation, prevent GAP proteins from increasing the catalytic rate of the GTPase and thereby lock RAS in the GTP-bound state²³.

### Molecular and cellular effects of RAS

RAS regulates many cellular functions, including gene expression, proliferation, survival, differentiation, cell cycle entry and cytoskeletal dynamics. Dysregulation of these cellular functions is a hallmark of cancer²⁴. The biological effects of RAS proteins are specified by the pathways that they regulate, which, in turn, are determined by the effectors with which they interact. Genetic studies in *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Caenorhabditis elegans*, which were validated by concurrent biochemical studies, established RAF1 as the first known RAS effector²⁵⁻³⁰. RAF1 is the first kinase in the MAPK cascade, which proceeds through the activation of MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK; also known as MAPKK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) (FIG. 1b). Numerous studies have implicated this pathway in biological processes as diverse as the negative selection of T lymphocytes in the thymus³¹ and the proliferation of epithelial cells¹⁰. The central role of the RAS–MAPK pathway in many cancers is substantiated by the fact that multiple nodes in this cascade have been identified as naturally occurring oncogenes, including mutant forms of the genes encoding epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), RAS, RAF and ETS.

Besides RAF1, at least six other families of proteins have been shown to interact with RAS in a GTP-dependent fashion and are therefore also considered to be effector proteins⁹ (FIG. 1c). Of these, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and a family of RAL-specific GEFs, which includes RAL guanine nucleotide dissociation stimulator (RALGDS), have been the most extensively studied. The ability of these effectors to contribute to oncogenesis is established, in part, by the fact that mutant forms of these proteins are themselves oncoproteins³²,³³. In addition, their ability to promote oncogenesis has been established in animal models. For example, mice deficient in RALGDS are protected from RAS-driven skin cancer³⁴. Knock-in mice homozygous for a PI3K p110α allele lacking a RAS-binding domain were protected from lung tumours induced by oncogenic KRAS4B³⁵. Another important RAS effector is T lymphoma invasion and metastasis-inducing 1 (TIAM1), a RAC-specific GEF that links RAS signalling to RAC³⁶, which is a RHO family GTPase that regulates the actin cytoskeleton and activates p21-activated kinases (PAKs) and JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK). Finally, phospholipase Cε (PLCε) is a RAS effector that enables RAS to directly stimulate the production of the second messengers diacylglycerol and calcium³⁷. Although TIAM1 and PLCε are not proto-oncoproteins, silencing the gene that encodes either of these effectors ameliorates HRAS-driven oncogenesis in a murine skin tumour model³⁸,³⁹.

that stimulates the release of GDP. GDP release promotes GTP-binding because GTP is ten times more abundant than GDP in the cytosol. SOS is the best-characterized RAS-specific GEF (RASGEF), owing to the fact that its role in the RAS–mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is firmly established. SOS binds constitutively to the adaptor protein growth factor receptor-bound 2 (GRB2), and this complex is brought, via the SH2 domain of the adaptor, to protein Tyr kinase receptors (PTKRs) at the plasma membrane, which have been activated by the phosphorylation of specific Tyr residues in their cytosolic domains (FIG. 1b). The translocation of the GRB2–SOS complex from the cytosol to the membrane-associated PTKR is aided by the pleckstrin homology (PH) and histone homology domains of SOS, both of which bind to negatively charged phospholipids¹⁸,¹⁹.

The intrinsic GTPase activity of RAS is very weak ($k_{\text{cat}} \approx 2 \times 10^{-4}$ s⁻¹)²⁰. The rate of catalysis can be increased by a factor of up to 10⁵ by the action of GAPs, and it is this class of protein that negatively regulates RAS and limits signalling. Mammalian genomes encode seven RAS-specific GAPs (RASGAPs), the best studied of which are p120 RASGAP (also known as RASA1) and neurofibromin¹⁵. The others are synaptic RASGAP (SYNGAP), GAP1ᵐ (also known as RASA2), GAP1 InsP₄-binding protein (GAP1ᴵᴾ⁴ᴮᴾ; also known as RASA3) and two calcium-regulated GAPs, calcium-promoted RAS inactivator (CAPRI; also known as RASA4) and

Figure 2 | PTM of the C-terminal membrane-targeting region of RAS. a | The hypervariable regions (HVRs) of the four RAS isoforms are shown. These sequences contain all of the information required to target the different RAS proteins to various subcellular membrane compartments, as demonstrated by the fact that they can be used in isolation to target unrelated proteins in the same way. The CAAX motif is often considered the ‘first signal’ because a ‘second signal’ immediately upstream of that sequence is also required for plasma membrane targeting. For HRAS, NRAS and KRAS4A, the second signal consists of Cys residues that are palmitoylated. For KRAS4B, the second signal consists of a polybasic region with a net positive charge of eight. The Cys residues of the CAAX motifs that are farnesylated are shown in yellow. The Cys residues in the second signal region that are modified by palmitate are shown in green. The Lys residues of the polybasic region of KRAS4B are shown in pink, and Ser181, which is the principal site of phosphorylation, is show in blue. b | CAAX processing is catalysed by three enzymes that work sequentially: farnesyltransferase (FTase), RAS-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1) and isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT). FTase is a cytosolic enzyme that catalyses the first, and rate-limiting, reaction in the sequence. RCE1 is an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-localized endoprotease that removes the AAX amino acids, rendering the farnesylcysteine the new carboxyl terminus. ICMT, which is also localized in ER membranes, methylesterifies the α-carboxyl group of the farnesylcysteine. S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) is used as the methyl donor in this reaction, generating S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) as a product. The end result of these modifications is to convert the C terminus of RAS proteins from a hydrophilic domain to a lipidated, hydrophobic domain in which the charge of the C-terminal carboxylate is negated by methylation. The reactions catalysed by FTase and RCE1 are irreversible, whereas prenylcysteine carboxyl methylation catalysed by ICMT is readily reversible at physiological pH, although a specific esterase that catalyses the reverse reaction has not been identified.

Regulation of RAS by constitutive PTMs

In addition to GTP binding, RAS proteins must associate with cellular membranes in order to transduce signals. Membrane association constrains RAS in two dimensions and thereby greatly facilitates its interaction with GEFs and GAPs. Indeed, RASGEFs are primarily regulated through their translocation to membranes via domains that bind membrane proteins (for example, SH2) or membrane phospholipids (for example, PH). Activated RAS, in turn, recruits its effectors to membranes. In the case of RAF1, the membrane itself participates in its activation via a poorly understood mechanism⁴⁰. Thus, RAS is not only an allosteric regulator of the RAF1 kinase but also a membrane tether for the protein⁴¹,⁴².

Nascent RAS is a globular, hydrophilic protein, and its association with cellular membranes is mediated by a series of PTMs, some of which are constitutive and occur immediately after translation, and some of which are conditional. Constitutive PTMs are discussed here, and conditional PTMs are discussed in the next section.

CAAX processing: prenylation, proteolysis and methylation. RAS is a member of a large class of proteins known as the CAAX proteins. The CAAX sequence is modified by three enzymes that work sequentially⁴³. First, unmodified CAAX sequences serve as substrates for prenylation by one of two cytosolic prenyltransferases⁴⁴,⁴⁵. If the amino acid in the X position is Leu⁴⁶, as is the case for most RHO family GTPases and the γ-subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins, then geranylgeranyltransferase type I (GGTase I) adds a 20-carbon polyisoprene lipid to the CAAX Cys via a stable thioether bond. Geranylgeranylation of RHO proteins not only allows them to associate with membranes, upon which they exert their biological effects, but also promotes their association with a cytosolic chaperone, RHO-specific GDP dissociation inhibitor (RHOGDI). Because RHOGDI possesses a hydrophobic pocket into which the geranylgeranyl lipid is sequestered, it can regulate the trafficking of RHO proteins on and off membranes⁴⁷. If the amino acid in the X position of CAAX is not Leu⁴⁶, as is the case for all RAS proteins, then farnesyltransferase (FTase) modifies the CAAX Cys with a 15-carbon farnesyl lipid (FIG. 2b). Farnesylation affords RAS proteins relatively weak affinity for cellular membranes⁴⁸. Several farnesyl binding proteins that are analogous to RHOGDI, such as phosphodiesterase δ (PDEδ)⁴⁹, have been described that may facilitate the trafficking of farnesylated proteins⁵⁰.

Proteins such as RAS that are modified only with a farnesyl lipid accumulate on the cytoplasmic face of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)¹¹, where they encounter the next CAAX-processing enzyme, RAS-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1). RAS prenylation is a prerequisite for the action of RCE1, not only because it is required for the colocalization of RAS and RCE1 on the ER, but also because of the substrate specificity of this protease. RCE1 is an endoprotease that removes the AAX amino acids so that the farnesylcysteine is the new C terminus⁵¹. RAS is then modified by another ER-resident

From this brief overview, it should be apparent that RAS is a prolific signalling molecule that is involved both in normal cellular homeostasis and in pathologic conditions. Accordingly, the PTMs that regulate RAS proteins have great significance both in normal physiology and in disease.
enzyme, isoprenylcysteine carboxylmethyltransferase (ICMT), which catalyses the methyl esterification of the α-carboxyl group of the farnesylcysteine<sup>52</sup>. Of these three modifications, only the one catalysed by ICMT is reversible (FIG. 2b). The end result of these three modifications is the remodelling of the C terminus of RAS proteins from a hydrophilic region to a hydrophobic one, which is capable of insertion into cellular membranes and is a requirement for the biological activity of RAS proteins.

There is no evidence that CAAX processing is regulated with respect to cell activation, metabolic status or cell cycle, suggesting that it is a ‘housekeeping’ process. One caveat is the recent description of the binding of a splice variant of SMGGDS, a GEF that is active against a wide range of small GTPases, to unprenylated RAS, which thereby retards its prenylation, suggesting a mode of regulation<sup>53</sup>. Two classes of drugs can block the prenylation of RAS and other proteins: statins, which inhibit 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) and therefore limit the availability of farnesyl pyrophosphate (an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway initiated by HMG-CoA reductase), and FTase inhibitors (FTIs), which directly inhibit farnesylation. A pool of unprocessed, endogenous RAS in the absence of prenylation-inhibiting drugs has not been described. RAS processed by the three sequential PTMs of the CAAX sequence can be distinguished from unprocessed RAS by SDS–PAGE because the processed form has a slightly faster electrophoretic mobility. The unprocessed form of endogenous RAS can be observed in SDS–PAGE only after treatment with statins or FTIs<sup>54,55</sup>. Concordant with these results, whereas endogenous RAS is readily detected in the cytosolic fraction of cells treated with statin or FTI, the vast majority of RAS is in the membrane fraction of untreated cells (M. Zhou and M.R.P, unpublished observations). These findings argue strongly against the existence a pool of unprocessed RAS that is awaiting processing and suggest that CAAX processing follows translation immediately in an efficient and constitutive manner. Nevertheless, the CAAX processing pathway can be saturated: when RAS is overexpressed, a significant pool is unprocessed, based on the results of electrophoretic mobility and subcellular fractionation (M. Zhou and M.R.P, unpublished observations).

Although CAAX processing is necessary for the delivery of RAS proteins to, and their stable association with, the plasma membrane, it is not sufficient for these events. Elements within the HVR that are upstream of the CAAX sequence<sup>56</sup> are also required. These elements have been called ‘second signals’ for plasma membrane targeting. There are two types of second signal: one consists of Cys residues that serve as acceptor sites for palmitoylation (as found in HRAS, NRAS and KRAS4A) and the other consists of polybasic regions rich in Lys residues (as found in KRAS4B) (FIG. 2a).

**Palmitoylation as a second signal.** The covalent attachment of the acyl chain of a fatty acid to a protein is known as protein acylation<sup>57</sup>. Although acyl chains of a variety of lengths have been shown to be incorporated into proteins, the 14-carbon myristoyl chain and the 16-carbon palmitoyl chain are the most commonly used. Myristoylation is largely restricted to the amino termini of proteins, whereas palmitoylation of Cys residues occurs throughout the polypeptide chain. The palmitoylation of RAS was first described 25 years ago<sup>58</sup>, and it was later appreciated that this PTM is isoform specific<sup>59</sup>. HRAS has two Cys residues that can accept palmitate (Cys181 and Cys184), whereas NRAS has only one (Cys181). Although the best studied splice variant of KRAS, KRAS4B, does not undergo palmitoylation, the other splice form, KRAS4A, is palmitoylated at Cys180 (REF. 60). Palmitate is linked to RAS via a labile thioester bond, and the modification is readily reversible<sup>61</sup>.

A palmitoyl acyltransferase (PAT) capable of modifying RAS was recently identified as the DHHC9–GPC16 (DHHC domain-containing 9–Golgi complex-associated protein of 16 kDa) complex<sup>62</sup>, which is an orthologue of the yeast Erf4–Erf2 complex<sup>63</sup>. DHHC9–GPC16 is a member of a family of 25 PATs, which all contain a DHHC motif but differ in their subcellular localization and substrate specificity<sup>64</sup>. Whereas all members of this family have a DHHC motif, most do not have binding partners that are analogous to GPC16. Knockdown studies suggest that DHHC9–GPC16 is not the only PAT with activity toward RAS<sup>65</sup>. DHHC9 and other DHHC motif-containing members of this family of enzymes are transmembrane proteins. Thus, CAAX processing of RAS, which affords the protein some affinity for membranes, would appear to be a prerequisite for palmitoylation. However, RAS mutants in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* that lack the CAAX Cys can still be palmitoylated, demonstrating that prenylation is not absolutely required for palmitoylation, at least in yeast<sup>66</sup>.

Palmitoylation is required for the trafficking of NRAS and HRAS from the endomembrane system to the plasma membrane<sup>11,67</sup> (FIG. 3). Palmitoylation of RAS takes place on the cytosolic face of the Golgi apparatus, where DHHC9–GPC16 resides. Farnesylated RAS has only modest affinity for membranes, but RAS that is both farnesylated and palmitoylated has more than 100-fold higher affinity<sup>68,69</sup> and therefore palmitoylation of RAS at the Golgi serves as an affinity trap for the protein. The high-affinity binding to membranes of dually lipidated proteins promotes their subcellular trafficking through vesicular transport.

**The polybasic region as a second signal for KRAS4B.** KRAS4B is unique among RAS proteins, in that it cannot be palmitoylated. Nevertheless, as is the case for all CAAX proteins, it still requires a second signal for trafficking to the plasma membrane<sup>56</sup>. The KRAS4B second signal consists of a Lys-rich domain in the HVR that has a net positive charge of eight. Thus, although no PTM is required to create this second signal, the motif is considered here because it complements farnesylation and can itself be modified by a PTM (see below). The polybasic region forms an electrostatic interaction with the negatively charged headgroups of the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. Neither this electrostatic interaction alone nor the insertion of the farnesyl group on RAS into the phospholipid bilayer provides sufficient affinity for

and proceeds via vesicular transport^{11,67}. The localization of DHHC9–GPC16 on the Golgi and the fact that dually lipidated proteins are affinity trapped by membranes supports this model. Photobleaching^{71,72} and photoactivation^{71} studies have revealed that retrograde trafficking of RAS from the plasma membrane to the Golgi requires depalmitoylation and is too rapid to occur via vesicular trafficking. These observations support the current model, in which NRAS and HRAS are palmitoylated on the Golgi apparatus and thereby affinity trapped in a membrane compartment, transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles and, after a certain period of time, depalmitoylated there and released back into the cytosol (FIG. 4). From the cytosol, RAS proteins can diffuse back to the Golgi for another round of palmitoylation and a return to the plasma membrane. Evidence that RAS signalling from the Golgi apparatus differs from RAS signalling from the plasma membrane in terms of relative downstream pathway use^{12,13,73–75} and, in the case of T lymphocytes, in biological outcome^{31}, supports the idea that the acylation-deacylation cycle is a way to modulate signalling.

There is no evidence that palmitoylation of RAS by DHHC9–GPC16 or any other PAT is regulated, suggesting that, like farnesylation, palmitoylation is an immediately post-translational housekeeping modification, although this is an under-investigated area. By contrast, there is evidence that depalmitoylation is regulated by GTP-loading of HRAS^{76}. Thus, elucidation of the mode of regulation of depalmitoylation rests, to some extent, on identifying the mechanism of palmitate removal. The thioester linkage between palmitate and its substrates is quite labile, and one school of thought holds that depalmitoylation may not be enzymatic. Another school holds that there are one or more RAS-specific palmitoyl thioesterases that catalyse the hydrolysis reaction. One candidate is acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1)^{77}. However, this protein has many other substrates and is found in the cytosol, raising the question of how it could have access to the palmitate modifications of membrane-bound RAS^{78}. A recent, highly innovative study used semisynthetic RAS proteins with cleavable or non-cleavable acyl modifications and came to the conclusion that, although RAS can be palmitoylated only on the Golgi, depalmitoylation can occur anywhere in the cell^{65}. This suggests a model whereby the entropy that would otherwise distribute RAS over all intracellular membranes is overcome by the restricted localization of palmitoylation on the Golgi and unidirectional vectorial vesicular transport^{65}.

**Palmitoylation-depalmitoylation cycling.** Unlike farnesylation, palmitoylation is readily reversible under physiological conditions. Indeed, it was shown more than 25 years ago that the half-life of palmitate on RAS was considerably shorter than the half-life of the protein^{61}. More recently, it was found that NRAS and HRAS undergo an acylation-deacylation cycle that is linked to RAS trafficking to and from the Golgi apparatus^{71,72}(FIG. 3). Anterograde trafficking from the Golgi to the plasma membrane requires palmitoylation

**Regulation of RAS by conditional PTMs**

As discussed above, farnesyl and palmitoyl lipidation of the C-terminal membrane-targeting domain of RAS are constitutive modifications that follow translation rapidly and efficiently. RAS proteins can also be modified in several other ways that are conditional upon cell activation, redox state or microbial pathogenesis. The conditions upon which these modifications occur, and their physiological relevance, are only beginning to be elucidated. These modifications are discussed below.

Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization. A recent study has implicated 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), a cis–trans prolyl isomerase, in the regulation of RAS depalmitoylation79 (FIG. 4). The extent of HRAS palmitoylation was shown to depend on the presence or absence of a Pro at position 179 in the HVR. FK506 and other chemical inhibitors of the prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12, including cycloheximide and rapamycin, inhibited HRAS depalmitoylation and this effect was recapitulated by silencing FKBP12. In addition, HRAS bound to FKBP12 in a palmitoylation-dependent fashion. Together, these observations suggest that isomerization of the Gly–Pro peptidyl-prolyl bond at position 178–179 of HRAS regulates depalmitoylation and thereby constitutes a molecular timer for acylation. Cis–trans isomerization about this bond, which accelerates RAS depalmitoylation, is catalysed by FKBP12. Thus, peptidyl-prolyl isomerization is the most recently recognized RAS PTM. Although originally thought to only play a part in the proper folding of nascent proteins, cis–trans isomerization of peptidyl-prolyl bonds is increasingly recognized as a mechanism for signalling, particularly when a molecular timer is required80.

Phosphorylation and the farnesyl-electrostatic switch. KRAS4B was first shown to be phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC) at its C terminus in 1987, although no biochemical effect of this modification was reported81. Recently, the PKC phosphorylation site was mapped to Ser181, which is positioned within the polybasic region82. Phosphorylation is stimulated by a calcium ionophore, implicating a conventional PKC as the relevant kinase, although which member (or members) of this class of kinase is involved in regulating KRAS4B has not been determined. The physiological stimulus that induces KRAS4B phosphorylation also remains to be elucidated. Phosphorylation of Ser181 reduces the net charge of the polybasic region, causing KRAS4B to lose affinity for the plasma membrane and to accumulate on endomembranes. This mechanism is reminiscent of the myristoyl–electrostatic switch, which regulates the membrane association of the myristoylated Ala-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS)83, and therefore it has been called the farnesyl–electrostatic switch (FIG. 5).

KRAS4B is not the only small GTPase that has a farnesyl–electrostatic switch; the RHO family GTPase RND3 is also regulated in this fashion84. Furthermore, RALA, a RAS family GTPase, is phosphorylated on Ser194 in its HVR by Aurora A kinase, and this causes it to translocate to mitochondria where it regulates mitochondrial fission85. Interestingly, when KRAS4B has an activating mutation, relocation to endomembranes as a consequence of the farnesyl–electrostatic switch is associated with cell death82. The mechanism for the cell toxicity is unclear but, paradoxically, the anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma-extra large (BCL-XL) is required82. In recent work, we found that the mechanism of diminished cell survival involves the capacity of phosphorylated KRAS4B to interfere with the ability of BCL-XL to sensitize inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate

Figure 4 | The acylation–deacylation cycle of HRAS. During acylation, the acyl chain of a fatty acid is covalently attached to a Cys residue of a protein via a labile thioester linkage. The most common fatty acid used for this purpose is palmitate, which contributes its 16 carbon saturated acyl chain to the protein. The enzymes that catalyse this lipidation reaction are known as palmitoyl acyltransferases (PATs). HRAS is palmitoylated on the Golgi apparatus by the PAT DHHC9–GCP16 (DHHC domain-containing 9–Golgi complex-associated protein of 16 kDa) (step 1) and sent to the plasma membrane through vesicular transport (step 2). Once on the membrane, HRAS is susceptible to depalmitoylation by a thioesterase, such as acyl-protein thioesterase 1 (APT1). Palmitoylated HRAS binds to 12 kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12), which catalyses cis–trans isomerization of the peptidyl-prolyl bond immediately adjacent to the palmitoylated Cys (step 3). This isomerization constitutes a molecular timer that promotes depalmitoylation, which allows HRAS to leave the plasma membrane (step 4) and diffuse back to the Golgi (step 5) for another round of acylation. FK506, rapamycin, cycloheximide (CHX) and other drugs that inhibit the prolyl isomerase activity of FKBP12 augment HRAS palmitoylation by inhibiting depalmitoylation.

receptors in a way that promotes the transfer of calcium from the ER to mitochondria, which is required for efficient respiration (P. Sung and M.R.P., unpublished observations). The farnesyl–electrostatic switch of oncogenic KRAS4B might be exploited in the development of anticancer drugs. Dissociation of KRAS4B from the plasma membrane was also observed in neurons stimulated with glutamate, and a mechanism involving calcium and calmodulin binding to the KRAS polybasic region was proposed86. Because calmodulin binds the polybasic region of KRAS4B and other proteins through a calcium-regulated electrostatic interaction, phosphorylation of Ser181 would be expected to diminish calmodulin binding. Thus, under conditions in which the farnesyl–electrostatic switch is engaged by the phosphorylation of KRAS4B on Ser181, calmodulin is unlikely to play a part in causing the dissociation of KRAS4B from the plasma membrane.

Figure 5 | The farnesyl-electrostatic switch of KRAS4B. The myristoylated Ala-rich C-kinase substrate (MARCKS) protein depicted above KRAS4B is known to associate conditionally with the plasma membrane by virtue of a myristoylated amino terminus and a nearby polybasic region. Protein kinase C (PKC)-induced phosphorylation of Ser residues (shown in pink) within the polybasic region of MARCKS partially neutralizes its positive charge and allows MARCKS to fall off the membrane in a process known as a myristoyl-electrostatic switch. The carboxy-terminal farnesyl modification of KRAS4B and the nearby polybasic region are similarly regulated by a farnesyl-electrostatic switch, which is activated by PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser181. Ser171 is also a phosphate acceptor that may contribute to, but is not required for, the operation of the farnesyl-electrostatic switch, which is primarily regulated by phosphorylation of Ser181. Specifically, phosphorylation of Ser181 in KRAS4B promotes the dissociation of RAS from membranes. The inset shows that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-bound KRAS4B dissociates from the membrane and is internalized in live Jurkat T cells upon exposure to the PKC agonist phorbol myristate acetate (PMA).

endosomal restriction of HRAS was also associated with a reduction in MAPK signalling, demonstrating that ubiquitylation is yet another PTM that regulates RAS compartmentalization and the spatial control of its signalling output. KRAS4B was recently found to be monoubiquitylated on Lys104 and Lys147 (REF. 88). This modification led to enhanced GTP loading and, in the setting of an oncogenic Val12 mutation, increased the affinity of KRAS4B for the downstream effectors RAF1 and PI3K.

**S-nitrosylation.** Cys118 is highly conserved among RAS isoforms and orthologues, and it is the most surface-exposed Cys on these GTPases. This residue was shown to be a redox switch more than 15 years ago<sup>90</sup>, and subsequent studies revealed that Cys118 could be nitrosylated when exposed to nitric oxide (NO)<sup>91</sup>. The mechanism of nitrosylation was later shown to be a direct interaction of the thiol of Cys118 either with a nitrogen dioxide radical (NO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>), formed when NO interacts with O<sub>2</sub>, or with a glutathionyl radical (GS<sup>•</sup>)<sup>92</sup>. S-nitrosylation does not alter the structure of RAS but leads to enhanced guanine nucleotide exchange<sup>93,94</sup>, which promotes more efficient RAS activation. This has led to the speculation that RAS signalling can be modulated by redox reactions, although the physiological relevance of RAS S-nitrosylation remains to be determined.

**Bacterial toxins and exoenzymes.** The RAS superfamily of small GTPases is a favourite target of bacterial virulence factors that evolved as enzymes which modify eukaryotic signalling molecules. Most such toxins and exoenzymes target the RHO family of small GTPases, which regulate the actin cytoskeleton<sup>95</sup>. However, there are also bacterial enzymes that are active against RAS. Exoenzyme S (ExoS) of *Pseudomonas aeruginosa* is an ADP-ribosyl transferase that modifies RAS. ExoS adds ADP-ribose to Arg41 and Arg128 of RAS, leading to inefficient guanine nucleotide exchange<sup>96</sup>. Lethal toxin of *Clostridium sordelli* is a monoglucosyltransferase that uses UDP-glucose as a substrate and glucosylates RAS on Thr35. Toxin B of *Clostridium difficile* has a similar activity towards RHO proteins<sup>97</sup>. Glucosylation of RAS inhibits signalling to MAPK<sup>98</sup>.

Whereas nascent RAS requires stoichiometric CAAX processing for maturation as a membrane protein, it is now clear that the mature protein can be modified in ways that modulate subcellular trafficking and signalling (FIG. 6). Although these modifications are conditional, in the sense that pools of RAS exist in both the modified and unmodified forms, the conditions in which these PTMs are stimulated, the stoichiometry of the modifications and their biological significance remain to be elucidated.

**Consequences of RAS PTMs**

The primary function of most of the PTMs of RAS is to deliver the molecule to the right place within the cell. In this section, we describe how the PTMs discussed above influence RAS trafficking to the plasma membrane and its partitioning into membrane microdomains.

RAS trafficking. CAAX processing and palmitoylation of RAS were originally thought to be a way to convert a globular hydrophilic protein into one with a hydrophobic C terminus that has generalized affinity for cell membranes. The discovery that two of the CAAX processing enzymes, ICMT and RCE1, are polytopic membrane proteins restricted to the ER revealed that RAS trafficking is more complex than originally believed [52,99,100].

Our current understanding of RAS trafficking begins in the cytosol, where nascent RAS is synthesized on free polysomes (FIG. 3). FTase, the first, and rate-limiting, of the CAAX processing enzymes, is cytosolic [101]. Once farnesylated, RAS gains modest affinity for membranes, particularly those of the ER. How farnesylated RAS is transferred from the cytosolic FTase to membranes is a matter of speculation. Are there chaperones involved? If so, does a single chaperone or family of chaperones both deliver farnesylated RAS to RCE1 and ICMT at the ER and also retrieve the fully CAAX-processed product? The existence, and physiological role, of RHOGDI, a geranylgeranyl-binding chaperone for RHO family GTPases [47], has led RAS biologists to speculate that an analogous chaperone may exist for farnesylated proteins. Several proteins have been identified in yeast two-hybrid screens as farnesyl-binding proteins, including PDE6δ [102], prenylated RAB acceptor 1 (PRA1) [103] and galectin [104]. Among these proteins, PDE6δ is particularly intriguing because its farnesyl-binding domain bears structural similarity to RHOGDI and because it was recently reported that its capacity to bind RAS and other farnesylated proteins is regulated by its interaction with the non-prenylated small GTPases ADP-ribosylation factor-like 1 (ARL1) and ARL2 (REF. 49). Moreover, a recent study reported that PDE6δ is required for proper trafficking of RAS and other farnesylated proteins, as well as for efficient RAS signalling [50]. Another intriguing possibility is that FTase itself might serve as the chaperone, as it was found to have an unusual mode of catalysis: it has the ability to retain its product in a secondary exit surface near the active site [101].

Whether or not chaperones play a role in RAS trafficking, the first membrane compartment visited by nascent RAS is the ER. The basis for the particular affinity of RAS for ER membranes is not universally accepted or understood, but it may relate to the biophysical properties of this compartment and the branched, unsaturated nature of the polyisoprene lipid that is added by farnesylation. Some investigators have argued that green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged prenylated proteins appear on the ER simply because the ER constitutes by far the greatest reservoir of membrane in the cell [65]. However, without a second signal, GFP-tagged RAS and other CAAX proteins appear neither on the plasma membrane nor on other abundant membrane-bound organelles, such as mitochondria [11], calling into question the notion of nonspecific membrane association. The particular affinity of RAS for the ER makes teleological sense, as it is here that the next two enzymes in the CAAX-processing cascade (RCE1 and ICMT') reside. Indeed, it is conceivable that RCE1 helps attract proteins with farnesylated CAAX sequences to the ER and thereby accounts for the observed membrane localization.

Once CAAX processing is complete, RAS isoforms diverge in their subsequent trafficking [43]. Palmitoylated isoforms visit the cytoplasmic face of the Golgi, where they are acylated and thereby affinity trapped in Golgi membranes, from which they can be incorporated into transport vesicles and enter the secretory pathway. KRAS4B cannot be trapped on the Golgi and proceeds to the plasma membrane either by passive diffusion or by an as yet uncharacterized delivery system that could involve cytosolic chaperones. Recent observations have revealed that the plasma membrane is not the end of the road for palmitoylated RAS or KRAS4B. Palmitoylated RAS undergoes retrograde trafficking, which is mediated by the acylation cycle described above [71,72], and KRAS4B undergoes retrograde trafficking from the plasma membrane to endomembranes upon phosphorylation and engagement of the farnesyl-electrostatic switch [82].

RAS is also trafficked to endosomes by two routes, one from the plasma membrane and one from the Golgi. RAS that is associated with clathrin-coated regions of the plasma membrane is internalized into primary endosomes during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. As clathrin-coated membrane domains also contain the activated PTKRs that signal through RAS and RAF1, all of these elements are present on these ‘signalling endosomes’ and signalling can persist [105]. Indeed, in some contexts,

Polytopic membrane proteins

endocytosis is absolutely required for RAS–MAPK signalling<sup>106</sup>. Recently, signalling endosomes were differentiated from their non-signalling counterparts by expression of APPL1 (adaptor protein containing PH domain, PTB domain and Leu zipper motif 1)<sup>107</sup>. APPL1 directly binds RAB5, PTKRs and the phospholipid bilayer, thus serving as a scaffold for signalling complexes that include RAS. The association of APPL1 with endosome membranes was dependent on low phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>) levels, suggesting that phosphoinositide remodelling interconverts signalling and non-signalling endosomes<sup>107</sup>. A second route to endosomes, which is taken by palmitoylated RAS, was recently described, in which NRAS and HRAS traffic from the Golgi to recycling endosomes and then on to the plasma membrane<sup>108</sup>.

There remains some disagreement as to whether KRAS4B associates with, and signals from, endosomes like its palmitoylated cousins. Several groups reported that, whereas NRAS and HRAS were associated with endosomes, KRAS4B was not<sup>87,109,110</sup>. These data are consistent with the observation that diubiquitylation promotes the association of RAS with endosomes but, although all three RAS isoforms examined can be monoubiquitylated, only NRAS and HRAS are diubiquitylated<sup>87</sup>. More recently, KRAS4B was reported to associate with early endosomes in a clathrin-dependent fashion and then to traffic to late endosomes, leaving HRAS behind<sup>111</sup>. Moreover, KRAS4B was found to reside on, signal from, and undergo degradation in, late endosomes, lysosomes and multivesicular bodies<sup>111</sup>. Clearly, we have more to learn about RAS trafficking through the endosomal compartment.

GDP for GTP causes HRAS to lose affinity for the lipid raft domains and to migrate laterally into adjacent regions of disordered plasma membrane<sup>117,118</sup>. Coincident with this migration is its interaction with a scaffolding protein, galectin 1, which acts to enrich GTP-bound HRAS in non-ordered microdomains<sup>119,120</sup>. Surprisingly, although the final ten amino acids of HRAS, which encompass the CAAX sequence and both palmitoylation sites, are sufficient to direct plasma membrane localization, they cannot fully recapitulate the dynamic behaviour of full-length HRAS with regard to plasma membrane nanoclusters and microdomains<sup>115,121</sup>. Instead, additional elements within the HVR and even the G domain help stabilize the membrane orientation and microdomain preference of full length HRAS at the plasma membrane and thereby contribute to differential effector engagement<sup>121–123</sup>.

Interestingly, the GTP binding status of NRAS also affects microdomain partitioning, but for this isoform it is the GTP-bound form that favours partitioning into cholesterol-dependent nanoclusters<sup>124</sup>, which in turn controls signal output. Thus, with regard to plasma membrane microdomains, monopalmitoylation versus dipalmitoylation appears to differentially control localization. Moreover, whereas HRAS that is monopalmitoylated on Cys181 behaves like NRAS, HRAS that is monopalmitoylated at Cys184 does not traffic efficiently to the plasma membrane<sup>124</sup>. Thus, it appears that the spacing between the prenyl and acyl modifications is also critical for proper trafficking and microdomain partitioning. The linker region comprising amino acids 170–179 within the HRAS HVR has also been shown to specifically contribute to the association of HRAS within non-raft microdomains<sup>121</sup>.

KRAS4B partitions into cholesterol-independent microdomains that do not overlap with those into which GTP-bound HRAS partitions<sup>115,125</sup>. Interaction with the galectin 3 scaffold enhances KRAS4B nanocluster formation<sup>126</sup>. Phosphorylation of GTP-bound KRAS4B on Ser181 reduces nanoclustering<sup>127</sup>. Thus, like palmitoylation, phosphorylation plays a part in nanocluster formation.

Generating a comprehensive model for how the C terminus of RAS proteins interacts with phospholipid bilayers is confounded by the inability to produce crystals of RAS that include its C terminus. All of the RAS structures that have been solved are from crystals of RAS proteins that lacked a C terminus, which is thought to be disordered<sup>128</sup>. However, recent molecular dynamic simulations and NMR data collected from full-length farnesylated HRAS in a 1,2-dimyristoylglycero-3-phosphocholine bilayer have provided computational models of membrane insertion and have revealed putative contributions of both the HVR and G domains in this process<sup>129–131</sup>. In these models, the GDP-bound conformation of HRAS favours electrostatic interactions between basic residues within its HVR and the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane. By contrast, residues within the α4 helix of the G domain facilitate the membrane association of GTP-bound, active, HRAS, control its orientation with respect to the membrane and thereby contribute directly to effector binding specificity<sup>132,133</sup>. Moreover, in these models,

Microdomain affinity and nanoclusters. RAS trafficking does not end at the plasma membrane because this organelle is not homogeneous but rather is composed of several types of microdomains<sup>112</sup>. Like its trafficking between organelles, the partitioning of RAS into membrane microdomains is regulated by PTMs. The best-characterized microdomain is a cholesterol-dependent, liquid-ordered domain often referred to as a ‘lipid raft’. Once thought to encompass relatively large patches of membrane analogous to the liquid-ordered domains observed in artificial bilayers<sup>113</sup>, cholesterol-dependent domains are now known to exist on a nanoscale, to be highly dynamic and to incorporate on the order of ten or fewer signalling molecules, such as RAS<sup>114,115</sup>. In addition to lipid rafts, at least two cholesterol-independent microdomains have been detected, and these are also thought to be highly dynamic and to exist on a nanoscale level<sup>112</sup>. Microdomains serve to bring together multiple signalling components. In addition, nanoclusters have been shown to convert analogue RAS–MAPK signalling into a digital signal that improves fidelity<sup>116</sup>.

Palmitoylation appears to be one of the strongest determinants of protein association with lipid rafts. Therefore, it is not surprising that HRAS, NRAS, and KRAS4B occupy distinct plasma membrane microdomains<sup>115</sup>. Inactive, GDP-bound HRAS has been found to group in nano-clusters of approximately six molecules within ordered, cholesterol-rich microdomains. Interestingly, exchange of

the depth of membrane insertion of palmitates was greater when HRAS was GTP-loaded, perhaps explaining the activation-specific association of HRAS with galectin 1 (REF. 130).

# Exploiting RAS PTMs for therapy

Oncogenic mutations of RAS block the ability of GAPs to accelerate GTP hydrolysis. Thus, the most direct approach to therapies targeting RAS would be to develop drugs that relieve this block. Unfortunately, efforts along these lines in academic laboratories have all failed. In addition to GTP loading, CAAX processing is required for oncogenic RAS to transform cells<sup>134</sup>. Accordingly, many have looked to RAS post-translational processing as an alternative approach to RAS-targeted drug discovery<sup>135,136</sup>. Two decades ago, several pharmaceutical companies successfully targeted FTase and developed orally available FTIs that were surprisingly well tolerated<sup>137</sup>. This effort was among the first successful applications of rational drug design. Unfortunately, FTIs lacked efficacy in clinical trials designed to treat tumours driven by mutant NRAS or KRAS, the two RAS isoforms that are associated with human cancer. The lack of efficacy proved to result from alternative prenylation, whereby NRAS and KRAS, which are normally not substrates for geranylgeranylation, could be modified by GGTase I in the presence of FTI<sup>138</sup>. This monumental failure has dampened enthusiasm in the biopharmaceutical industry for targeting the RAS trafficking pathway. Nevertheless, the approach retains its scientific logic and remains among the most viable. Indeed, both GGTase I inhibitors (GGTI) and ICMT inhibitors have shown promise in preclinical testing<sup>139,140</sup>. Furthermore, as a protease, RCE1 is considered ‘drugable’, and efforts at developing inhibitors against it have been reported<sup>141</sup>. Curiously, whereas genetic ablation of *Icmt* in mice has confirmed it to be a good target for anticancer drug discovery<sup>142</sup>, conditional knockout of *Rce1* exacerbates KRAS4B-driven myeloproliferative disease<sup>143</sup>, suggesting that this enzyme may not be a good target for anticancer drug discovery. The biological basis for the differences between targeted disruption of ICMT and RCE1 in tumour models remains elusive and probably reflects the fact that RAS is but one of many substrates for these enzymes.

## Conclusions

The GTP binding, GTP hydrolysis and switching functions of RAS require no PTMs, although some PTMs affect exchange rates. However, PTMs are required for the proper trafficking and localization of RAS within the cell, which, in turn, are essential for RAS function. CAAX modification by FTase, RCE1 and ICMT remodels the C terminus of the protein and creates a hydrophobic domain with affinity for membranes. Palmitoylation affinity traps NRAS and HRAS in Golgi membranes and initiates a cycle of traffic to and from the plasma membrane. Peptidyl-prolyl isomerization of HRAS at Pro179 by FKBP12 regulates depalmitoylation and thereby acts as a molecular timer for plasma membrane association. Diubiquitylation of NRAS and HRAS leads to their enrichment on endosomes. Phosphorylation of KRAS4B in its polybasic region engages a farnesyl–electrostatic switch that repositions the protein on endomembranes, a process that is associated with cell death when KRAS4B is activated. S-nitrosylation, ADP-ribosylation and glucosylation are modifications that do not affect the localization of RAS but do affect guanine nucleotide exchange rates. Thus, the location and function of RAS is determined by PTMs, making the enzymes that catalyse these modifications interesting targets for drug discovery.

Although much has been learned over the past two decades with regard to the PTM of RAS (FIG. 6), many questions remain. Will recently developed GGTIs, alone or in common with FTIs, block RAS function without undue toxicity? What is the basis for the biological differences observed with ICMT versus RCE1 inhibition? Can substrates of these enzymes other than RAS explain the differences? Is there a RAS-specific cytosolic chaperone, and could farnesyl-peptide mimetics be developed to block its activity? Is there a specific PAT and thioesterase pair that palmitoylates and depalmitoylates RAS, and would these serve as good drug targets? Does inhibition of cis–trans prolyl isomerization by FK506 and rapamycin explain any of the activities of these widely used drugs? Further basic investigation into the network of PTMs that affect RAS trafficking and signalling will be required before these questions are answered.
