Sequence analysis of a 5.323 kb chromosomal DNA fragment from *Acetobacter xylinum* involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharide acetan, revealed the presence of four *ace* genes designated *aceB*, *aceC*, *aceD* and *aceE*. Comparison of translated gene sequences to the databanks was used to assign putative gene functions. AceB displayed strong homology to a glucose-diphosphoprenyl β,D-glucose transferase from *Xanthomonas campestris*, while AceC was homologous to a cellobiosyl-diphosphoprenyl α,D-mannose transferase from the same organism. Thus these genes encode enzymes catalyzing the second and third steps of the acetan biosynthetic pathway. AceD and AceE were homologous to ExoP and ExoT respectively from *Rhizobium meliloti* and are likely to be involved in acetan polymerization and export.

## INTRODUCTION

Many microorganisms have the ability to synthesize extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and excrete them from the cell, either as soluble or insoluble polymers. Such polymers confer selective advantages to the host; for example, allowing adherence to inert surfaces, protection from desiccation and other environmental stresses, antigenic variation of pathogenic strains, and masking immune recognition. Consequently bacterial EPS provide important model systems for the study of molecular assembly and secretion, gene regulation, cell-cell interactions, symbiosis, pathogenesis, and the relationship between polysaccharide structure and function (Leigh and Coplin, 1992; Colquhoun et al., 1995). In addition, microbial polymers, such as xanthan, are widely used in the food and other industries as gelling, thickening, texturizing, suspending and encapsulating agents (Sutherland, 1990). In recent years there has been considerable interest in developing novel microbial polysaccharides for use in industry and one of the long-term aims of these studies is to genetically engineer new polymers with altered structures that confer improved and novel properties.

*Acetobacter xylinum* is used in the production of a sweet confectionery (Nata) enjoyed in many areas around the world (Brown, 1989). It is also associated with the industrial production of vinegar. Two different extracellular polysaccharides are produced by this organism. The first is cellulose, a linear homopolymer composed of β,D-glucose (1 → 4) sugar units. The second polymer is acetan, an acidic heteropolysaccharide consisting of a cellulose backbone with side-chains attached to alternate glucose units. It has a heptasaccharide repeat unit with the following structure: α,L-rha-(1 → 6)-β,D-glc-(1 → 6)-α,D glc-(1 → 4)-β,D-glcA-(1 → 2)-α,D-man-(1 → 3)-β,D-glc-(1 → 4)-β,D-glc (Colquhoun et al., 1995). Acetan is structurally related to the industrially important polymer, xanthan (Jansson et al., 1975) which is produced by *Xanthomonas campestris*.

In order to engineer novel acetan based polysaccharides it is essential to genetically characterize the pathway for biosynthesis. Although the biochemical pathway for acetan biosynthesis has been elucidated (de lannino *et al.*, 1988) (Figure 1), little is known of the genetics of this process. We have previously reported the cloning and sequencing of the aceA gene which encodes a phospho-prenyl glucose-1-phosphate likely to catalyze the first step in acetan biosynthesis (Griffin *et al.*, 1996). This paper describes the nucleotide sequencing and analysis of the A.xylanum aceB, aceC, aceD and aceE genes.

### RESULTS

The complete DNA sequence of a 5323 bp region of pAG1 (Griffin *et al.*, 1994, 1996) containing genes involved in acetan biosynthesis was determined. Computer analysis revealed the presence of four open reading frames (ORF) that showed strong conformity with the Acetobacter codon usage table (not shown). These were designated aceB, aceC, aceD and aceE (Figure 2) and encoded proteins of 230, 384, 638 and 383 amino acids respectively. The protein coding sequence of aceE extended beyond the region sequenced. No potential ORF's were detected on the complementary strand. Putative ribosome binding sites (rbs) with homology to the 3' end of Acetobacter 16S rRNA sequences (Sievers *et al.*, 1994) were identified upstream of all 4 genes. AceB was separated from aceD by a long intergenic region (304 bp), while aceD and aceC were 18 bp apart. The initiation codon for aceE overlapped the termination codon for aceC suggestive of translational coupling within a polycistronic message (Kozak, 1983). No consensus sequences for Escherichia coli promoters (Harley and Reynolds, 1987) could be identified preceding any of the genes.

#### Predicted proteins encoded in this 5.32 Kb fragment and their homology to described amino acid sequences

The Sugar Transferases, aceB and aceC Comparison of predicted amino acid sequence of aceB to the translated (all six frames) DNA sequences in the EMBL and GenBank databanks using the program TFASTA (Pearson, 1994) and BLAST (Altschul *et al.*, 1990) revealed closest similarity (57.89% similarity; 29.67% identity) to the translated gumM gene from X.campestris (Capage *et al.*, 1987)(Figure 3A). This gene encodes a glucose-diphosphoprenyl β,D-glucose transferase catalyzing the second step in

**Figure 1** The pathway for acetan biosynthesis in A. xylanum involves the stepwise assembly of the heptasaccharide repeat unit on a diphosphate prenol or lipid carrier. The first seven steps are catalyzed by sugar transferases. Glc, glucose; Man, mannose; GlcA, glucuronic acid; Rha, rhamnose; O-Ac, acetyl group.

xanthan biosynthesis (Vanderslice et al., 1990). Thus it is likely that aceB encodes the enzyme transferring a β, D-glucose (1 → 4) to a lipid-linked glucose in the acetan pathway (Figure 1; step 2). Comparison of the amino acid sequence of AceB to the DataBanks using the program BEAUTY (Worley et al., 1995) revealed homology to the 4 members of a family of probable techoic kda UDP-N-Acetyl-D-Mannosaminouronic acid (UDP-ManNAc) transferases. These were RffM from Escherichia coli and Salmonella thphimurium (Daniels et al., 1992; Lu, 1992) TagA from Bacillus subtilis (Mauel et al., 1991) and CpsF from Streptococcus pneumoniae (Guidolin et al., 1994). Analysis of the evolutionary relationship of AceB to members of the UDP-ManNAc transferase family and to other β, D-glucose (1 → 4) transferases from Rhizobium meliloti (Becker et al., 1993A, 1993B) and A.xylinum (Standal et al., 1994) is presented in Figure 4. It is interesting to note that the  

AceB and GumM appear more closely related to the UPD-ManNAc transferases (RffM, TagA and CpsF) than to the other glucosyl transferases (ExoM, Exol and BcsA).

Strong homology (67% similarity and 44.8% identity) was found between AceC and GumH from X.campestris (Capage et al., 1987)(Figure 3C). Analysis of lipid-linked intermediates generated in vitro from strains containing mutations in gumH demonstrated that gumH encodes a cellobiosyl-diphosphoprenyl α, D-Mannose transferase (Vanderslice et al., 1990). The amino acid sequences of aceC was also homologous to RfbU (Jiang et al., 1991; Liu et al., 1993) from S.typhimurium (50% similarity and 23.4% identity). RfbU is involved in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and is thought to provide an mannosyl transferase activity (Liu et al., 1993). Therefore AceC probably catalyses the transfer of α, D-Mannose to the growing lipid-

These proteins are involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis in their respective hosts.

program MOTIFS, an ATP-GTP binding motif A (P-Loop) (Saraste et al., 1990) with the consensus sequence [AG]-X4-G-K-[ST] was detected between position 442–451 in AceD (Figure 2). Both ExoP and AmsA also contain this motif in their C-terminal domains (Becker et al., 1993B; Glucksmann et al., 1993). The N-terminal region of AceD, between residues 328 to 361 matched well with a motif, PX₂PX₄SPKX₁₁GXMXG, present in the N-terminal domain of ExoP and other proteins involved in polysaccharide polymerization and export (Figure 5) (Becker et al., 1995). The hydrophatic profiles (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) of AceD, ExoP and AmsA were similar (data not shown) and resembled those of membrane associated proteins (Becker et al., 1993B, 1995; Bugert and Geider, 1995).

Comparison of the (incomplete) amino acid sequence of AceE to the DataBanks using the program BEAUTY revealed homology to the 3 (of 5) members of a family of putative O-antigen transporters. These were RfbE from Shigella flexneri

(Morona et al., 1994) with 58.7% similarity and 26% identity (see Figure 3D); RfbX from E. coli (Stevenson et al., 1994) with 49.3% similarity and 19.7% identity; and RfbX from S.typhimurium (Jiang et al., 1991) with 50% similarity and 18% identity. A BLAST search and other analyses identified homology with ExoT from R.meliloti (Becker et al., 1993A), GumJ from X.campestris (Capage et al., 1987), TrgA from Yersinia enterocolitica (Skurnik et al., 1992) and RfbX from Shigella dysenteriae (Klena and Schnaitman, 1993). ExoT, GumJ and RfbX are involved in polysaccharide export in their respective hosts (Glucksmann et al., 1993; Schnaitman and Klena, 1993; Vanderslice et al., 1990), so it is very likely that AceE plays a similar role in A.xylanum. An analysis of the evolutionary relationships between these proteins is presented in Figure 6. This tree splits these export proteins broadly into two groups. AceE is depicted as having closest homology to RfbE from S. flexneri and is only distantly related to GumJ from X.campestris. Analysis of the hydrophaticity confirmed that AceE is

DISCUSSION

Four ace genes have been identified on a 5.32 Kb chromosomal DNA fragment from *A.xylanum*. Gene functions were assigned on the basis of homology to genes in the databanks; two appear to encode sugar transferases while the other two are likely to be involved in polysaccharide export. The initiation codon is ATG for all but the *aceC* gene, where a TTG is likely to be used. Although ATG is the most commonly used initiation codon, it is well known that other codons can also be used, though the efficiency of initiation is reduced. A study of 300 ribosome binding sites in *E.coli* revealed that the initiation codons were 91% AUG, 8% GUG and 1% UUG (Gold and Stormo, 1987). Recently an *A.xylanum* gene with a GTG start codon has been reported (Standal et al., 1994). Thus it is very possible that TTG is the start codon of *aceC*, however further experimental data will be required to prove this. *E. coli* promoter consensus sequences were not identified in this fragment indicating that this fragment is probably part of an operon structure. Genes involved in polysaccharide biosynthesis are clustered in operon structures in the majority of organisms studied to date (Leigh and Coplin, 1992; Griffin et al., 1995; Schnaitman and Klena, 1993). In the case of the acetan operon, the promoter identified upstream of *aceA* is likely to be utilized (Griffin et al., 1996).

It is intriguing that *A.xylanum* which produces two very similar polysaccharides, cellulose and acetan should have two very different enzymes catalyzing

the transfer of β, D-glucose (1 → 4). An examination of the evolutionary relationship between BcsA (from the cellulose pathway) and AceB showed that AceB is in fact more closely related to UDP-ManNAc trans-

ferases. That these sugar transferases apparently are divided into two different families has important implications for creation of novel polysaccharides using heterologous gene expression.

AceD is homologous to ExoP from *R. meliloti* and is likely to be involved in polymerization and export of polysaccharide. Like ExoP, it contains two different domains, the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains. Recently, (Becker et al., 1995) have reported that analysis of *lacZ* and *phoA* translational fusions to the *exoP* gene indicated that the N-terminal domain is located in the periplasmic space and the C-terminal is located in the cytoplasm. Hydrophobic profiles reveal the presence of two transmembrane region. These transmembrane regions were similarly located in AceD. A motif common to several proteins involved in polysaccharide polymerization and export, and found in the N-terminal domain of ExoP and AmsA, was also present in AceD. Among the proteins containing this motif are a family of proteins involved in determining O-antigen chain length in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis. These are termed the CLD or Rol proteins (Bastin et al., 1993; Batchelor et al., 1992; Morona et al., 1995). Although, the role of the motif is unknown, it has been postulated to be involved in an interaction with the polymerase (Bastin et al., 1993; Becker et al., 1995). In the case of CDL and Rol, this interaction could promote a change of conformation; from one promoting polymerization of O-antigen subunits and one promoting termination of this polymerization and transfer of the O-antigen chain to the lipidA core. It has recently been suggested that ExoP might be involved in determining polysaccharide chain length by a similar mechanism (Becker et al., 1995). The C-terminal domain of AceD contains an ATP/GTP binding motif. This motif is homologous to several prokaryotic ATPases but not to the ATP-binding domain of the ABC transporters (Becker et al., 1995). It has recently been demonstrated that the C-terminal domain is not essential for some EPS polymerization and export leading to the speculation that this domain may have a regulatory role (Becker et al., 1995). They postulate that ATP or GTP binding and hydrolysis could cause a conformational change of the N-terminal domain. However, it is also possible that the C-terminal plays a role in an energy dependent translocation across the inner membrane (Leigh and Walker, 1994).

RfbE was homologous to proteins involved in polysaccharide export in other organisms. Analysis of the evolutionary relationship between RfbE and its

homologues revealed that it is only distantly related to GumJ from *X. campestris*. This was a little surprising since both AceE and GumJ are involved in the export of structurally the related polymers i.e. acetan and xanthan.

This report details the analysis of a 5.32 kb fragment of *A. xylinum* genomic DNA containing genes involved in acetan biosynthesis. In further experiments we will confirm the functions of selected *ace* gene functions by gene inactivation and biochemical methods.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

### Media and bacterial strains

The *E. coli* strain TG1 (Sambrook et al., 1989) was grown in L-broth or on L-agar (Miller, 1972) at 37°C. Ampicillin was added to a concentration of 100 μg ml⁻¹ when required.

### DNA manipulations

DNA, from plasmid pAG1 (Griffin et al., 1994, 1996) was prepared by centrifugation through Cesium Chloride-Ethidium Bromide gradients as described previously (Sambrook et al., 1989). Restriction enzymes and DNA modifying enzymes were purchased from Gibco BRL, Paisley, U.K. and were used according to the manufacturers instructions. Standard molecular cloning, transformation and electrophoresis techniques were used as described (Sambrook et al., 1989). Double stranded DNA sequencing was performed on plasmid DNA with the ABI 373A automated sequencer. Sequence data were analyzed on a VAX 4600 using the computer analysis package GCG version 8.0 (Devereux et al., 1984), CLUSTAL (Higgins, 1994), FASTA, TFASTA (Pearson, 1994), BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) and BEAUTY (Worley et al., 1995).
