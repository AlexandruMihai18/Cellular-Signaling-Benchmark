There are two types of adipose tissue with distinct functions—white adipose tissue stores chemical energy as triglycerides, whereas brown adipose tissue consumes energy and releases heat (thermogenesis) in response to sympathetic nerve activity. In humans, treatments that promote greater brown adipose tissue deposition and/or activity would be highly beneficial in regimes aimed at reducing obesity. Adult humans have restricted populations of prototypical brown adipocytes in the neck and chest areas, but recent advances have established that adipocytes with similar properties, termed “brite” adipocytes, can be recruited in subcutaneous depots thought to be primarily white adipose tissue. These brite adipocytes express the protein machinery required for thermogenesis, but to assess brite adipocytes as viable therapeutic targets we need to understand how to promote conversion of white adipocytes to brite adipocytes and ways to increase optimal energy consumption and thermogenesis in these brite adipocytes. This can be accomplished by pharmacological and nutritional therapies to differing degrees, as reviewed in detail here.

### 1 Introduction

The high prevalence of obesity and type 2 diabetes worldwide has provoked continuing debate about the optimal balance between lifestyle interventions, namely, reduced intake of energy-rich foods coupled with increased physical activity, and medical interventions, including pharmacological treatment and invasive procedures exemplified by bariatric surgery. There are many individual factors contributing to obesity, so a “one size fits all” approach is unlikely to benefit the entire target population, highlighting the WAT, retroperitoneal WAT; SVF, stromal vascular fraction; sWAT, subcutaneous WAT; Tbx1, T-box transcription factor-1; TCPTP, tyrosine-protein phosphatase nonreceptor type 2; TRPM8, transient receptor potential melastatin 8; TRPV1, transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1; T3, triiodothyronine; UCP1, uncoupling protein 1; WAT, white adipose tissue; Zic1, zinc finger of the cerebellum protein family 1

Figure 1. β₃-AR-mediated thermogenesis in brown adipocytes. NA released from sympathetic nerves acting at β₃-ARs elevates intracellular cAMP levels, which activates PKA to phosphorylate lipases that liberate free fatty acids from lipolysis that activates UCP1. PKA can also phosphorylate p38 MAPK, leading to activation of an array of transcriptional proteins leading to upregulation of the UCP1 gene.

need for additional pharmacological and/or nutritional approaches to weight loss. Such therapies must be safe—for example, ephedrine effectively promotes weight loss but has unacceptable effects on the cardiovascular system, while orlistat promotes modest weight loss but has significant gastrointestinal side effects. Since the progression of obesity is driven by a positive imbalance between energy intake and energy expenditure, with excess energy stored as fat, novel therapies aimed directly at adipose tissue are highly attractive. As an alternative or complementary approach to therapies that reduce appetite or nutrient absorption, adipose-based approaches would shift the ledger away from energy storage and toward dissipation of energy as heat.

### 1.1 Adipose tissue type, structure, and function

Brown adipose tissue (BAT) governs sympathetically mediated nonshivering thermogenesis in mammals [1]. BAT depots are rich in mitochondria, highly innervated, and activated by centers in the brain responsive to cold exposure or food intake, leading to the release of noradrenaline (NA) from sympathetic nerves. Binding of NA to BAT β-ARs (where AR is adrenoceptor) activates intracellular signaling cascades leading to increased expression of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), and breakdown of triglycerides to free fatty acids that activate UCP1 in the inner mitochondrial membrane. Activated UCP1 collapses the proton gradient that would otherwise drive adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis and energy storage, thereby establishing a futile metabolic cycle that increases oxygen consumption and generates heat [1] (Fig. 1).

BAT was thought to be present only in rodents and other small mammals, with larger mammals (including humans) losing their BAT after infancy. However, unexpected

evidence from positron emission tomography (PET) scans of ¹⁸fluorodeoxyglucose uptake revealed that adult humans possess active BAT, which is highest in the supraclavicular and neck regions. Prototypical BAT has been identified in the intrascapular region of human infants, and in deep regions of adult neck [2, 3]. Human BAT is activated upon cold exposure [4–7], with activity dependent upon age, sex, and the presence of obesity. Importantly, human adipose depots from the neck region contain UCP1 [8, 9].

Unlike brown adipocytes, the white adipocyte is dominated by the presence of a single large vacuole providing triglyceride storage, but is still vascularized and innervated by the sympathetic nervous system (reviewed extensively in [10]). After excess dietary nutrient uptake (or decreased energy expenditure), WAT can take up both glucose and free fatty acids from blood plasma to be converted to triglycerides; however in humans reesterification of fatty acids occurs preferentially compared with de novo lipogenesis from glucose [11]. WAT is in turn able to alter nutritional status by the release of adipokines into the vasculature and lymphatic systems, including leptin, adiponectin, resistin, and the inflammatory mediators Tumor necrosis factor-α [12, 13]. In the context of obesity, these play both local (adipocyte proliferation and differentiation) and central roles (controlling satiety and energy catabolism). WAT is also highly innervated with both afferent and efferent sympathetic nerves [14], facilitating central control over white adipocyte proliferation and adaptation.

### 1.2 The brite adipocyte

While the existence of brown adipocytes in depots thought to be primarily WAT was first documented several decades ago [15–17], it has only been recently that other groups [18–20]

have sought to clarify whether these cells are true brown adipocytes or not. These cells differ from prototypical BAT found in rodents or human infants, and have been termed brite (brown in white), beige, or inducible brown adipocytes (Fig. 2). It was originally assumed that brown and white adipocytes shared a common developmental origin as they have similar lipid metabolism and gene expression patterns [21]. Recent studies have shown that brown preadipocytes have a transcriptional profile similar to skeletal muscle cells, and that both derive from the myogenic factor 5 (Myf-5) muscle cell lineage [18, 22, 23]. In contrast, brite adipocytes are not derived from an Myf-5 lineage but express the WAT marker homeobox protein C9 (Hoxc9). Cell lineage studies indicate that in subcutaneous inguinal WAT (iWAT) from cold-exposed mice, brite adipocytes are derived directly from preexisting unilocular white adipocytes [24] and smooth muscle cells [25].

The transcriptional regulator PRDM16 (PR domain containing 16) plays a central role in determining classical brown adipocyte differentiation from embryonic Myf-5+ precursor cells [23], and the appearance of brite adipocytes in subcutaneous WAT (sWAT) [26]. Ectopic expression of PRDM16 in WAT protects mice from diet-induced obesity and metabolic dysfunction, while mice with adipocyte-specific, postembryonic deletion of PRDM16 fail to undergo “browning” of sWAT and are prone to diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and fatty liver disease [27].

Brite adipocytes have been identified in human supraclavicular fat depots and from neck biopsies [3, 28]. At both sites, adipocytes from nearby subcutaneous biopsies have the hallmarks of classical WAT. Based on a consensus between human and mouse studies, UCP1 is the key marker for both brown and brite adipocytes, while the transcription factor Zic1 (zinc finger of the cerebellum protein family 1) is highly selective for brown adipocytes compared with brite adipocytes [18, 22, 29]. Tbx1 (T-box transcription factor 1) is the most selective marker for brite adipocytes [28]. Both brown and brite adipocytes also highly express peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor γ (PPAR-γ) coactivator 1α (PGC-1α), a master regulator of energy metabolism. Hoxc9 is expressed in WAT and in mouse brite adipocytes derived from subcutaneous adipose tissue, though expression is lower in human supraclavicular samples.

### 1.3 White Adipose Depots and Brite Recruitment

The major sites of fat accumulation in humans are differentially associated with susceptibility to the metabolic syndrome, insulin resistance, and other related diseases—visceral fat is more harmful than subcutaneous fat [21, 30]. Omental (and to some extent mesenteric) visceral fat is the main site of fat accumulation during obesity, particularly for men; however under pathological conditions lipids can also accumulate in other tissues, such as skeletal muscle, liver, and the cardiovascular system. The relationship between adipose tissue distribution and individual risk of metabolic disease is further highlighted in several highly relevant papers [31, 32]. Closer analysis of human WAT depots shows that white adipocytes can be loosely apportioned into two subtypes—smaller, proliferative adipocytes with a greater differentiation potential and larger, slower proliferating cells capable of higher lipid accumulation [33–35]. sWAT depots are dominated by the smaller subtype, while visceral depots are dominated by the larger subtype [35].

In mice, induction of thermogenic gene expression occurs to a much greater extent in subcutaneous iWAT depots compared with visceral mesenteric or epididymal depots (eWAT) [26, 27, 36]. This is also strain dependent as both 129 and A/J mice show a greater browning and thermogenic capacity than more obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice [37–39] within corresponding WAT depots. Recruitment of brite adipocytes in humans can therefore be expected to be variable, given the inherent plasticity of these cells and immense genetic variation in humans compared with inbred mouse strains. Nevertheless, while detection of brite adipocytes in vivo is problematic

due to their punctate expression within WAT, induction of a  
brite phenotype from human subcutaneous white adipocyte  
derived progenitors has recently been demonstrated in vitro  
[40]. In healthy human subjects, cold-activated BAT, as deter-  
mined by positron emission tomography-CT scans, has been  
measured to weigh between 9 and 90 g [41] or 30–300 g [42].  
Based on a human subject having 63 g of supraclavicular BAT,  
it was calculated that its full activation would burn the equiva-  
lent of 4.1 kg of WAT a year [7]. Energy expenditure would be  
increased substantially by the recruitment of brite adipocytes  
in additional fat depots. For example, mildly obese humans  
(BMI 31) are estimated to have up to 27 kg of sWAT [43]. Even  
if rates of brite conversion and thermogenesis are low com-  
pared with classical BAT, a moderate and sustained ability  
of brite adipocytes to be uncoupled could lead to substan-  
tial metabolic benefits, as seen in mice ectopically expressing  
PRDM16 or UCP1 in sWAT [26, 44].

### 1.4 Experimental limitations in the identification of  
brite adipocyte inducing agents

There are clear methodological points that can affect the ap-  
parent efficacy of browning agents in vivo or in cultured  
adipocytes. First, UCP1 mRNA does not equate to UCP1  
protein or enhanced function [45]. A majority of studies on  
browning performed to date have defined browning as an  
increase in UCP1 mRNA, with none or limited investigation  
of whether this leads to an enhanced functional response in  
vivo, ex vivo, or in vitro. This is a major limitation in the field.  
Second, in whole-animal experiments initial levels of UCP1  
expression in WAT are dependent on additional variables in-  
cluding housing temperature [46], mouse strain [37–39], and  
diet [47, 48]. Mouse studies of browning agents are there-  
fore ideally performed under thermoneutrality (~30°C) with  
matched diets. Third, mouse or other whole-animal studies  
are complicated by the possibility that administered agents  
will have confounding effects via the central nervous system  
(CNS) or other tissues. The thyroid hormone triiodothyronine  
(T3) is an example of this. While it may have some brown-  
ing effect in vitro [49, 50], T3 administered to whole mice  
acts through the hypothalamus to drive sympathetic release  
onto BAT depots [51]. Furthermore, mutation of the thyroid  
hormone receptor TRα1 (R384C) increases BAT UCP1 levels  
despite reducing T3 potency for the receptor [52]. It was found  
that this shift in potency reduced tail artery responsiveness,  
increasing heat dissipation, and thereby driving sympathetic  
flow to maintain body temperature [52, 53]. This highlights  
not only the need for careful interpretation of in vivo stud-  
ies but also shows the interplay of sympathetic flow and the  
cardiovascular system.

In vivo studies should be accompanied by a demon-  
stration that the test agent has browning capacity in cul-  
tured adipocytes. While this circumvents the issues of  
mouse environment and CNS or cardiovascular activity, the  
choice of cell preparation and culture conditions may still  

compromise experimental validity. Older studies commonly  
utilized fibroblastic cell lines (such as 3T3-L1 cells) to study  
adipocyte function. These cells are typically cultured and  
differentiated into mature adipocytes with adipogenic cock-  
tails that include 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (a phosphodi-  
esterase (PDE) inhibitor), T3 (a thyroid hormone), insulin or  
insulin-like growth factor-1 (typically at μM concentrations),  
corticosterone/dexamethasone, and rosiglitazone (PPAR-γ  
agonist), many of which display inherent browning potential.  
More recent studies have used preadipocytes isolated from  
the stromal vascular fraction (SVF) of BAT and WAT depots  
[1, 18]. While some groups allow SVF-derived adipocytes to  
proliferate and differentiate with minimal adipogenic factors  
(e.g., 10% serum plus 2.4 nM insulin; [16]), others have still  
used the 3T3-L1 cocktail approach in primary adipocyte cul-  
tures, including agents such as rosiglitazone for the first 2–4  
days of culture [28, 54].

Beyond UCP1 content, expending energy via thermogen-  
esis requires UCP1 activation—that is, the emergence of brite  
adipocytes itself is insufficient to promote increased energy  
expenditure, as these cells must also be activated by environ-  
mental, hormonal, nutritional, or pharmacological stimuli.  
Many of the browning agents listed below act directly on white  
adipocytes to promote transcriptional changes in these cells;  
however, these will have negligible effects on total energy  
expenditure without changes to sympathetic outflow. This  
highlights the need for an additional agent capable of activ-  
ating brite adipocytes. In addition, a recent study has shown  
that brite adipocyte induction in vivo is transient, with re-  
moval from cold exposure resulting in the cessation of UCP1  
mRNA transcription and transdifferentiation back to a white  
adipocyte [20]. This interconversional plasticity indicates that  
any therapy targeting increased brite thermogenesis may re-  
quire a permanent brite-inducing agent to maintain adequate  
brite expression.

## 2 Agents that increase browning of white  
adipose tissue

There are a wide variety of agents reported to increase the  
browning of white adipose tissue (WAT), from the “classi-  
cal” activation of the sympathetic nervous system to exercise,  
myokines, adipokines, cytokines, and nutritional and dietary  
factors. We have provided a summary of the findings for each  
of the reported agents, with detailed information in Support-  
ing Information Table 1 and summarised briefly in Table 1.

### 2.1 Cold exposure, activation of the sympathetic  
nervous system, and β₃-AR agonists

As outlined above, cold exposure and activation of the symp-  
 pathetic nervous system represent the classical paradigm of  
whole-animal brite adipocyte appearance. Sympathetic inner-  
vation of BAT has long been established [55], and recent

advances in viral tracking techniques have uncovered more-complex sympathetic innervation to both subcutaneous and visceral WAT depots than originally thought [14, 56, 57]. This innervation is important as cold exposure promotes sympathetic drive to both BAT and WAT [58], resulting in increased NA release from nerve terminals within these depots. The role of the sympathetic nervous system in energy balance is complex and relevant reviews on this subject are available [59, 60].

Cold exposure is a key regulator of BAT, as it increases UCP1 presence and function in BAT from a wide array of small mammals (as reviewed extensively by [1]), and mice lacking UCP1 are cold intolerant due to a reduced ability to perform nonshivering thermogenesis [61–63]. Long-term cold exposure has an additional effect on BAT function by increasing the proliferation and differentiation of brown preadipocytes to fully mature brown adipocytes [64]. Cold exposure also increases UCP1 content in depots considered to be “white” [16, 17, 37, 38], and these UCP1-positive adipocytes from cold-acclimatized mice display functional mitochondrial uncoupling [65].

NA released from sympathetic nerve terminals acts at the AR family of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). There are nine subtypes, of which the β₃-AR has the primary role in BAT function, playing a well-established role in mediating lipolysis and mitochondrial biogenesis (Fig. 1). The β₃-AR was a focus of drug development with early studies showing agonists as potential antiobesity and antidiabetic agents in rodent models (reviewed in [66]). When tested in humans, the prototypical β₃-AR agonists CL316243 and BRL37344 displayed low efficacy due to differences between the human and mouse β₃-AR ligand binding pockets, poor pharmacokinetic properties, oral bioavailability, and off-target effects (BRL37344 caused significant muscle tremor through agonist actions at β₂-ARs). In rodents, chronic β₃-AR agonist treatment results in ectopic expression of UCP1 in WAT depots [16, 38, 67, 68], and the

appearance of multilocular lipid droplets in WAT [69]. While studies have investigated the consequence of β₃-AR gene deletion in BAT function [70–73] and shown compensatory mechanisms due to increased β₁-AR expression and function, the same cannot be said for WAT. Jimenez et al. showed a vital role of β₃-ARs as knockout mice exposed to the cold had blunted UCP1 mRNA/protein levels in WAT compared with wild-type mice [71]. In triple β-AR knockout mice, there is compromised thermogenesis and these mice are prone to developing obesity and type 2 diabetes [74]. This suggests that the β₃-AR is critical for WAT browning in response to cold, but in BAT other compensatory mechanisms exist.

In humans, only two acute treatments have been shown to promote increased BAT activity based on ¹⁸fluorodeoxyglucose uptake: cold exposure [75, 76] and administration of adrenergic agonists (ephedrine [77] or mirabegron, a new class of β₃-AR agonist [78]). Whether these agents increase human brite adipocyte emergence is still unknown.

### 2.2 GPCRs, ion channels, and signaling pathway modulators

#### 2.2.1 Adenosine receptor agonists

Adenosine receptors are GPCRs with diverse roles in adipocyte function that are receptor subtype, tissue, and species dependent [79–81]. Adenosine inhibits lipolysis in BAT from hamsters and rats via the Gαi/o-coupled A₁ receptor, concomitant with a reduced sensitivity to catecholamines [82–85]. Gnad et al. clearly demonstrated, on the other hand, that activation of the Gαs-coupled A₂A receptor promotes increased basal and NA-stimulated lipolysis in cultured human and mouse brown adipocytes and at lower potency in

white adipocytes [81]. In whole-animal studies, treatment of mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) with the A₂A agonist CGS21680 reduced body weight and fat mass, and increased basal and NA-stimulated oxygen consumption without causing changes in food intake or physical activity. Importantly, treatment of mice with CGS21680 for 10 days caused substantial increases in PGC-1α and UCP1 mRNA, and the appearance of small, multilocular brite adipocytes expressing UCP1 protein in iWAT depots [81]. Overall, this recent study demonstrated an unexpected role of A₂A receptor activation on BAT activity, the conversion of white to brite adipocytes, and protection of mice from diet-induced obesity.

### 2.2.2 Cannabinoid CB1 receptors

Rimonabant, an inverse agonist at the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor, had clear efficacy in the treatment of obesity through suppression of appetite but was withdrawn due to adverse psychiatric problems. While CB1 receptors are predominantly located in the CNS where they increase sympathetic tone to the periphery [86], peripheral CB1 receptors are expressed on human WAT; and their expression is increased during adipogenesis [87, 88]. While rimonabant has no effect on the capability of mouse white adipocytes to undergo differentiation, it increases both UCP1 mRNA and protein levels, associated with increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxygen consumption rates (OCR) [89]. iWAT adipocytes derived from CB1 knockout mice [90] have increased UCP1 and PGC-1α expression and cellular respiration. This may indicate that the beneficial role of rimonabant included direct actions on WAT function, as well as its well-known central action.

### 2.2.3 Melatonin

The neurohormone melatonin acts at the GPCRs’ melatonin receptor 1 and 2. It has long been implicated in the control of energy balance, with administration reducing weight and obesity in rodents [91–94] and having antidiabetic effects [95, 96]. Reductions in body weight occur without a reduction in food intake [93, 95] and have therefore been attributed to increases in energy expenditure by BAT [97]. Despite these effects on energy expenditure, it was only recently that the browning effect of melatonin was investigated. Melatonin treatment leads to increased UCP1 and PGC-1α mRNA expression in iWAT of Zucker lean rats, with an observable temperature increase in thermal scans in inguinal regions, increased appearance of multilocular fat droplets, and increased mitochondrial activity in iWAT [98, 99]. The browning effects of melatonin were still present in Zucker diabetic fatty rats, although to a much lesser degree [98, 99]. The precise mechanism of the melatonin effect on browning remains poorly understood, but it has been linked to the endogenous expression of other browning agents, such as irisin [98] and inhibition of estrogen receptor α expression [100].

### 2.2.4 Natriuretic peptides

The natriuretic peptides atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), and C-type natriuretic peptide act at natriuretic peptide receptor (NPR), NPR-A, NPR-B, and NPR-C. Originally thought to be hormones that solely regulate salt excretion and the renin–angiotensin system to modulate blood pressure, ANP and BNP are released during exercise and cold exposure and appear to play a role in exercise-induced lipolysis [101, 102]. ANP and BNP both act at NPR-A in WAT to activate lipolysis through a non-PKA-dependent mechanism (where PKA is protein kinase A) via protein kinase G (PKG) [103–105] and activate lipolysis in human adipocytes [106]. Both ANP and BNP increase UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in cultured human adipocytes independent of, but additive to, catecholamine stimulation through a p38 MAPK-mediated mechanism, which results in increased mitochondrial biogenesis and increased uncoupled and total respiration [101]. Mice treated with BNP have increased respiration and energy expenditure, associated with an increase in UCP1 and PGC1-α expression in WAT [101]. The authors suggest that the heart is a central regulator of adipose tissue biology. While there is evidence of low-level lipolysis mediated by NPs in rat adipocytes [107], there has been no in vitro evidence of NPs browning rodent WAT, which may be due to the relatively high expression of the inhibitory NPR-C receptor that targets natriuretic peptides for internalization in nonprimate species [108].

---

### 2.2.5 Nicotine

Nicotine regulates whole-body energy homeostasis by decreasing weight gain and food intake, while increasing energy metabolism, lipolysis, and physical activity (reviewed in [109]). This includes actions on BAT thermogenesis [109] and glucose uptake [110], and perhaps a role in WAT lipolysis [109]. These effects of nicotine can generally be replicated with smoking [109]. One study to date has investigated the role of nicotine on browning capacity in WAT. Yoshida et al. showed that chronic nicotine treatment of obese yellow KK mice decreases whole-body weights that are associated with decreased WAT weights and increased UCP1 mRNA and protein in WAT depots, with increased multilocular adipocytes in WAT [111]. This contrasts to mice exposed to cigarette smoke, where a reduction in eWAT and retroperitoneal WAT (rpWAT) weights is associated with decreased UCP1 mRNA in WAT [112]. Hence, nicotine may have browning potential but this effect is negated through smoking.

---

### 2.2.6 Phosphodiesterase inhibitors

PDEs are key regulatory enzymes that inactivate the second messengers cAMP and cGMP. Knockout of a cAMP-specific PDE (PDE3B) increases the appearance of brite adipocytes

within eWAT depots [113]. More recently, browning of white adipocytes has also been observed via cGMP production [114]. cGMP drives activation of PKG, which can increase mitochondrial biogenesis and UCP1 upregulation in mouse BAT [115], and expression of a constitutively active PKG mutant protects mice from diet-induced obesity [116]. Thus, inhibition of PDEs promotes the browning process.

PDE inhibitors include natural products such as caffeine (a nonselective PDE inhibitor) and clinical drugs such as sildenafil (Viagra) that inhibits the cGMP-selective PDE5. Acute caffeine administration in obese mice (up to 24 h) increased UCP1 mRNA expression in BAT, but UCP1 levels in WAT were not measured [117]. Sildenafil treatment of mice for 7 days increased UCP1 and PGC-1α protein expression in iWAT, although in this timeframe no changes to body weight or fat mass were observed [114]. The mechanism by which cGMP/PKG acts is still unclear, but it may involve insulin receptor substrate 1 dependent phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt activity [115] and p38 MAPK activation [101, 115].

### 2.2.7 Transient receptor potential melastatin 8

Transient receptor potential melastatin 8 (TRPM8) is a Na⁺/Ca²⁺ ion channel expressed in sensory neurons, which is activated by cold and menthol stimuli [118]. It provides skin and mucosal sensitivity to innocuous cold temperatures. TRPM8 is also expressed in BAT and visceral WAT depots, and its expression is significantly increased in mouse mature adipocytes [119]. Treatment with menthol increases UCP1 expression and activation in brown adipocytes from mice in a Ca²⁺/PKA-dependent mechanism and prevents diet-induced obesity by increasing thermogenesis in mice [120], although this does not involve upregulation of conventional browning regulators such as PGC-1α. Human white adipocytes also express TRPM8 channels, with menthol treatment increasing TRPM8 and UCP1 expression in a dose-dependent manner [121], with no significant change in the expression of the key brown adipocyte gene PRDM16. However, TRPM8 activation in human white adipocytes by either menthol or icilin altered mitochondrial morphology and increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to increased heat production in vitro [121]. These results suggest that TRPM8 plays a role in both WAT and BAT metabolism and function that appears to be independent of changes in the transcription of genes involved in adipose tissue regulation such as PGC-1α and PRDM16.

## 2.3 Exercise and associated factors

Exercise increases UCP1 mRNA/protein levels and multilocular fat droplets in iWAT but to a much lesser (or no) degree in eWAT depots in both rats [47] and mice [122], with no effects on BAT UCP1 levels [123, 124]. Exercise training in humans may increase the release of β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA) and irisin that act as browning agents in WAT [125, 126]. In contrast, another paper examining 12-wk exercise training in human subjects found no significant increase in plasma irisin, or UCP1 mRNA levels in sWAT [127]. A recent study found more profound effects in mice after 11-day freely available wheel training, increasing iWAT UCP1 mRNA and protein expression, with negligible changes in visceral WAT [128]. Furthermore, transplantation of exercise-browned iWAT (but not visceral WAT) from trained mice into a sedentary recipient on an HFD improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity in the recipient [128]. The potential of exercise as a browning stimulus may partially explain the benefits of exercise in weight loss therapies, but the mechanism whereby this occurs needs further study, although PGC-1α [122] and IL-6 [129] have been shown to be required for exercise-mediated regulation of UCP1 expression in iWAT.

### 2.3.1 BAIBA

BAIBA is a compound identified by metabolic profiling of serum-free media derived from skeletal myocytes overexpressing PGC-1α, a model system mimicking the effect of exercise [125]. BAIBA increases UCP1 mRNA by 5.3-fold in adipocytes cultured from the SVF of mouse iWAT, though it should be noted that cells were differentiated in the presence of 1 μM rosiglitazone. BAIBA also increases UCP1 mRNA as well as basal and uncoupled oxygen consumption in human IPSC-derived adipocytes. In vivo administration of BAIBA prevents diet-induced obesity [130] and improves glucose tolerance in mice [125]. In human subjects, fasting plasma levels of BAIBA are inversely correlated with indicators of insulin resistance and metabolic disease, and display significant increases following 20 wk of endurance exercise training [125]. With only one study published on the browning role of BAIBA to date, more work is needed to confirm this finding and strengthen the potential role of BAIBA in adipose tissue remodeling.

### 2.3.2 Irisin

Irisin is a purported myokine that was identified from transgenic mice overexpressing PGC-1α in skeletal muscle [54]. It is derived from the FNDC5 gene that displays increased muscle expression following exercise. Posttranslational cleavage of the FNDC5 precursor protein generates free circulating irisin. Several studies have shown that irisin can brown iWAT in vivo [54, 131] and in vitro [28, 54], based on increased UCP1 mRNA or protein levels, increased mitochondrial size, and increased OCR (although [132] showed increased UCP1 mRNA expression in 3T3-L1 adipocytes without any effect on lipolysis). Irisin acts synergistically with fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) to increase oxygen consumption in human adipocytes [133], although [134] did not observe any effects of irisin on UCP1, Zic1, or PPAR-γ mRNA levels in human adipocytes. There is much controversy over irisin as a browning agent. One study [126] could only detect increased FNDC5

expression in elderly people who exercise, and not in any other groups examined. A second paper in rats showed that exercise did not affect FNDC5 expression in skeletal muscle or circulating levels of irisin, but it did increase FNDC5 content in iWAT [47]. The authors suggested that FNDC5 produced in iWAT, rather than circulating irisin, mediated the effect of exercise on white fat browning. A commentary [135] and two papers [134, 136] have highlighted several critical inadequacies in the irisin/FNDC5 field. Raschke et al. [134] showed first that the start codon of the FNDC5 gene is mutated in humans, not allowing translation of the gene to protein, and second that the gene is not regulated by contraction in human skeletal muscle. The study by Albrecht et al. [136] highlighted the technical issues in the field, namely, the nonspecificity of the antibodies available. Therefore, the links among irisin and obesity, skeletal muscle, and metabolic status remain controversial.

### 2.3.3 Lactate

L-Lactate is produced from pyruvate by the enzyme lactate dehydrogenase, and levels are increased during metabolism and exercise. A recent study showed an additional role of lactate as a potential browning agent. Lactate increases UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in human and mouse white adipocytes in vitro, and in vivo in mice [137]. This is independent of effects on HIF1-α and PPAR-α, but requires PPAR-γ, and the effect of lactate on UCP1 mRNA expression in vivo is potentiated if rosiglitazone is coadministered. While lactate can act at the GPCR GPR81, its actions as a browning agent are independent of GPR81 but instead via monocarboxylate transporters [137]. There are no studies showing a functional impact of lactate on adipose tissue remodeling or increased thermogenic capacity of WAT to date, therefore the significance of lactate as a browning agent remains unknown.

## 2.4 Growth factors and cytokines

### 2.4.1 BMP-7 and BMP-4

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) act at heterooligomeric type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors. Different BMPs have roles in adipocyte function: BMP-2 and BMP-4 increase white adipogenesis in some [138, 139] but not all 3T3-L1 cells [140], while BMP-2, BMP-4, BMP-6, and BMP-7 increase lipid accumulation in brown preadipocytes, with BMP-7 the most efficacious [140]. BMP-7 increases UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in brown preadipocytes, associated with an increase in mitochondrial density [140]. While this study by Tseng et al. [140] failed to show a browning effect of BMP-7 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, their second study [141] showed that BMP-7 increases UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in mouse BAT and iWAT adipocyte cultures (but not eWAT cultures), with the effect more pronounced in adipocytes derived from obesity-resistant 129-S1 mice compared with the obesity-prone C57BL/6 mice. The browning effect of BMP-7 can be observed when administered to mice placed on an HFD, with a synergistic effect on UCP1 mRNA levels when coadministered with the β₃-AR agonist CL316243 [141]. In white adipocyte cultures derived from human sWAT, both BMP-4 and BMP-7 increased UCP1 mRNA levels and cellular respiration [141, 142].

#### 2.4.2 FGF21

FGF21 has a major role in metabolism through actions at the tyrosine kinase FGF receptors in complex with β-klotho. While circulating FGF21 is produced mainly by the liver, it can be synthesized in BAT and iWAT following cold exposure and β-AR activation [133, 143, 144]. FGF21 treatment of mice decreases body fat mass, increases oxygen consumption in eWAT isolated from these mice [145, 146], and acts synergistically with irisin to increase adipocyte oxygen consumption [133]. It is possible that FGF21 acts in an autocrine/paracrine function. Production in iWAT promotes browning of the tissue as evidenced by increased UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in vivo and in vitro, requiring PGC-1α [144]. Alternatively, the action of FGF21 may be through central activation of the sympathetic nervous system [145]. Other studies have shown a role for FGF21 in browning of WAT [146, 147] without elucidation of a central or peripheral action.

#### 2.4.3 Folllistatin

Follistatin is an extracellular protein that functions as an activin- and myostatin-binding protein and inhibits signaling through TGF-β superfamily members that regulate diverse processes such as cell growth and differentiation. A role for this pathway in BAT function comes from studies showing inhibition of brown adipocyte differentiation by myostatin [148]. Inactivating myostatin decreases BAT UCP1 mRNA content in vivo and in vitro and protects against diet-induced obesity through inhibition of the TGFβ/myostatin/Smad3 cascade [149, 150]. In follistatin knockout mice, adipocyte-derived mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) have decreased lipid droplets, decreased UCP1 mRNA and protein levels, and a decrease in oxygen consumption, and conversely treatment of MEF-derived adipocytes with follistatin increases UCP1 mRNA and protein levels [151]. However, as this is the only study to report a browning action of follistatin, more research is required.

#### 2.4.4 IL-6

The cytokine IL-6 is secreted from contracting skeletal muscle. Its role in adipocyte function comes from studies performed in IL-6 knockout mice that have decreased whole-body

oxygen consumption and increased respiratory exchange ratio [152], indicating reduced whole-body energy expenditure and fat oxidation. Exercise-trained IL-6 knockout mice have increased PPAR-γ mRNA levels in iWAT [153] and chronic IL-6 treatment increases UCP1 mRNA, but not protein levels in iWAT [129]. This mismatch between UCP1 mRNA and protein levels was also observed when mice were cold exposed: while cold exposure increased UCP1 mRNA levels similarly in wild-type and IL-6 knockout mice, UCP1 protein levels were blunted in cold-exposed IL-6 knockout mice [129]. Although exercise increases UCP1 content in iWAT, this effect was absent or lower in IL-6 knockout mice at the mRNA and protein levels [129]. Hence it appears that IL-6 has a role in the browning of iWAT due to cold exposure and exercise. This effect is not due to increases of conventional BAT genes in WAT, including Elovl3, Cidea, or PGC-1α whose expression is not affected by IL-6 administration [129].

### 2.5 Insulin and leptin

Insulin is released from pancreatic β-islet cells following increases in blood glucose levels after feeding, and acts at the tyrosine kinase linked insulin receptor. Activation increases a well-characterized signaling pathway that results in increased glucose transporter translocation to the cell surface of target cells (muscle, adipose tissue) to decrease blood glucose levels. Insulin significantly affects both lipid and glucose metabolism in WAT and BAT [154, 155], and presumably brite adipocytes, although there are no reports of this as yet. There is no evidence that insulin alone can induce browning of WAT, and in BAT, insulin does not increase UCP1 mRNA or protein levels in most studies performed [156, 157]. Leptin is produced by white adipocytes, where it acts predominately at leptin receptors in the brain to control appetite and energy expenditure. The latter effect in rodents is due to leptin promoting sympathetic nervous activity to BAT, resulting in increased UCP1 expression and BAT activity [158–160]. The effect of leptin on browning of WAT is unclear, as one study [158] showed no evidence that leptin increases UCP1 mRNA in a range of WAT depots, whereas a second study [161] showed ectopic increases in UCP1 expression in WAT following chronic leptin treatment. This discrepancy may be due to findings in a recent study showing that leptin and insulin act synergistically to promote WAT browning (and BAT thermogenesis) via a centrally mediated mechanism [162], utilizing mice that lacked both tyrosine-protein phosphatase nonreceptor type 2 (TCPTP) and protein-tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) only in POMC neurons (PTP1B suppresses leptin signaling in hypothalamic POMC neurons, whereas TCPTP dephosphorylates STAT3 in the hypothalamus). These mice had increased UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in iWAT depots (associated with an increase in other thermogenic markers including Prdm16), and these depots had a greater abundance of smaller adipocytes with multilocular lipid droplets. The TCPTP/PTP1B double-knockout

mice were protected from diet-induced obesity through an increase in WAT browning and increased energy expenditure through an increase in sympathetic nervous activity [162]. This study again highlights how peripheral signals can induce browning of WAT through a centrally mediated mechanism.

#### 2.6 Nutritional and dietary factors

##### 2.6.1 Bile acids

Bile acids (BAs) are a diverse range of amphipathic molecules, synthesized mainly in the liver (termed primary BAs) and modified by gut microbiota (secondary BAs). BAs are secreted into the intestine after eating where their primary role is to act as a detergent to assist in the solubilization of lipids. However, BAs also display activity at two recognized target receptors: the cell surface expressed GPCR TGR5 receptor (or G protein coupled BA receptor 1), and the nuclear farnesoid X receptor (FXR). Due to the nuclear location of FXR, activation by BAs requires the presence of dedicated BA transporters in these cells, and therefore restricts the majority of BA-mediated FXR activation to intestine and liver, where these transporters are predominantly expressed.

BAs were initially suggested to regulate whole-body glucose homeostasis via hepatic FXR activation to repress gluconeogenesis [163, 164]. However, FXR also plays a key role in adipocyte function as adipogenic differentiation of MEFs from FXR-KO mice is significantly inhibited [165, 166]. Studies of BAT found that the BA chenodeoxycholic acid or the BA-binding resin colestimide (which indirectly promotes endogenous BA synthesis) increased BAT UCP-1 and PGC-1α mRNA expression and energy expenditure via thyroid hormone activation [167, 168]; however, this response was not replicated by the FXR-α agonist GW4064 [167]. Both BAT and WAT also express TGR5 (summarized in [169]), and thyroid hormone activation in BAT was replicated by a TGR5 agonist [167]. It was not until recently that it was suggested BAs might also affect UCP1 expression in WAT [170, 171]. Chenodeoxycholic acid treatment induced a small increase in sWAT UCP1 mRNA and protein expression, but this did not coincide with any increases in PRDM16 mRNA levels [170]. The FXR-selective agonist fexaramine also increased UCP1 mRNA expression in both BAT and iWAT (and protein in iWAT) and resulted in increased energy expenditure [171]. While Fang et al. noted increased glucose tolerance via TGR5 activation, TGR5-KO mice also exhibited increased energy expenditure [171], suggesting that UCP1 upregulation by fexaramine is not via TGR5. It is clear further studies are required to determine the exact mechanism of BA effects on UCP1.

##### 2.6.2 Plant extracts

Berberine is a plant alkaloid present in several plants including traditional Chinese medicinal herbs. It can prevent

olanzapine-induced weight gain in vivo in rats [172] and can increase energy expenditure and BAT activity in obese $db/db$ mice [173]. It can induce browning of iWAT, but not eWAT, via an AMPK-PGC-1α-mediated mechanism [173].

Capsaicin and capsaicin analogs have been suggested to have potential roles as antiobesity drugs, as they can activate BAT via either TRPV1 (transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1) activation or increased sympathetic nervous activity to BAT [174, 175]. Activation of TRPV1 channels by capsaicin or other TRPV1 agonists increases UCP1 mRNA in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, and also in iWAT of mice chronically administered with TRPV1 agonists [176]. Capsaicin treatment in vivo also further enhances iWAT UCP1 expression and protein levels in rats placed on an HFD [177]. The browning ability of capsaicin is solely based on UCP1 mRNA/protein levels without any measurement of a functional consequence.

Fucoxanthin is a carotenoid found in edible seaweed with purported beneficial roles in obesity, diabetes, and cancer (reviewed in [178]). Fucoxanthin itself, or fucoxanthin-rich seaweed extracts, decreases body weight and WAT mass in rats and mice [179], an effect associated with a significant increase in UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in WAT [179]. This may be due to enhanced adrenergic activation since fucoxanthin increases β₃-AR mRNA levels in WAT [180, 181]. In humans, the effect of fucoxanthin or fucoxanthin-rich seaweed extracts on WAT browning is unknown but a recent double-blinded placebo-controlled human study (obese females) showed a significant reduction in body weight of nearly 5 kg over a 16-wk period [182].

Black soybean (*Glycine max*) and soybean seed coat extracts are rich in polyphenols and are used as a traditional remedy for diabetes, liver and renal function, and diuretic actions. Soybean extracts also attenuate the progression of streptozotocin-induced type 1 diabetes in rats [183]. Dietary administration of soybean extract to HFD-fed mice prevents weight gain and reduces WAT mass without reducing energy intake [184]. Subsequently, it was found that UCP1 expression is increased in both BAT and iWAT (although the effect in WAT was somewhat blunted by HFD) resulting in improved glucose tolerance and reduced insulin resistance [184]. The mechanism by which polyphenols may increase UCP1 levels remains unknown.

Resveratrol is a plant phytoalexin and its beneficial role in metabolism is due to improved mitochondrial function via a Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) and PGC-1α-mediated mechanism [185]. Resveratrol treatment increases BAT UCP1 protein in animals [186], and may inhibit adipogenesis in proliferating 3T3-L1 adipocytes and increase apoptosis in mature 3T3-L1 adipocytes [187]. It also decreases lipogenesis and increases lipolysis in isolated adipocytes and WAT [188, 189]. A review on the antiobesity potential of resveratrol can be found elsewhere [190]. With respect to browning capability, resveratrol increases UCP1 expression in MEF-derived adipocytes [191] and in proliferating but not fully differentiated 3T3-L1 adipocytes [187]. In MEF-derived adipocytes, this is correlated

with increased expression of other thermogenic genes, increased mitochondrial DNA content and palmitate oxidation [191]. A recent study [192] showed resveratrol increased UCP1 expression and OCR in iWAT cultures in vitro and following in vivo administration, through an AMPK-mediated mechanism, suggesting that resveratrol increases the formation of brite adipocytes *in vivo* to produce its beneficial metabolic effects.

### 2.6.3 Amino acids and metabolites

Methionine is an essential amino acid and its restriction in diets mimics the effect of chronic dietary restriction, decreasing body weight without alterations in food intake [193] and potentially increasing lifespan in mice [194]. Dietary methionine restriction results in decreased rpWAT and eWAT weights that are accompanied by increased UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in eWAT, iWAT, rpWAT, and BAT in mice [193, 195]. These effects are associated with an increase in energy expenditure rates, an increase in uncoupled respiration, and alterations in leptin and adiponectin plasma concentrations [193]. These effects are presumably due to activation of the sympathetic nervous system as the increased UCP1 mRNA levels are abolished in BAT (but not iWAT) of β₃-AR knockout mice [196], and are associated with an increase in FGF21 levels [195] that has also been shown to induce browning of adipose tissue.

The metabolic effect of another essential amino acid, leucine, is unclear. One study found a beneficial role of leucine supplementation on adiposity in HFD animals [197]; another study showed no effect in mice placed on a high protein diet [198], while a third study showed restriction of leucine decreased adiposity in animals [199, 200]. In that study, there was an increase in UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in BAT, and while UCP1 mRNA levels were not measured in WAT, there was increased lipolysis, fatty acid synthase activity, an increase in expression of β-oxidation genes, and a decrease in lipogenic genes [199]. These effects were due to leptin signaling [200] as effects were abolished in $db/db$ mice.

Dietary deficiency in utero can sensitize offspring to an array of later metabolic disorders including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Only a handful of studies have indicated adaptations in adipose tissue browning due to maternal dietary restrictions, with several groups advocating the hypothalamic-fat axis and WAT itself as potential key targets of adult adiposity due to maternal undernutrition [201–203]. In a study by Delahaye et al. [204], restriction of the maternal diet to 50% of calories resulted in smaller male offspring (females were not investigated). At 3 wk of age, these offspring had smaller WAT and unchanged BAT depots (expressed as percentage body weight) but, surprisingly, a 400% increase in UCP1 mRNA levels in eWAT that correlated with increased UCP1 protein levels. This was associated with an increase in genes involved in energy metabolism in eWAT but not in the hypothalamus, suggesting a noncentral role in the

browning observed. This increased browning of eWAT was plastic, with little browning observed in these rats 4 wk after birth. The results seem counterintuitive, however these mice have elevated levels of NA, and in combination with little WAT for insulation, they may compensate for maintenance of heat through thermogenesis until adequate WAT mass occurs (these mice are hyperphagic which supports this notion). Another study showed that a 20% caloric restriction of the maternal diet results in decreased BAT UCP1 mRNA levels in male and female offspring that result in lower BAT function [205]. It is clear that further studies are warranted to characterize the effect of maternal undernutrition on the development of the offspring, especially if these offspring are subsequently subjected to an HFD.

In adult rodents, fasting (while increasing metabolic efficiency) decreases UCP1 expression and activity in BAT [46, 206, 207]. The effect of fasting on WAT UCP1 expression is unknown but is warranted for further studies as this may have implications in chronic fasting conditions such as anorexia.

L-arginine is a semiessential α-amino acid, with a lack of L-arginine in the diet impairing growth and development (reviewed in [208]). Increased dietary L-arginine prevents WAT mass growth in rodents and humans [209–212]. L-arginine is implicated in BAT development [213], increasing BAT mass (and reducing WAT fat pad mass), mitochondrial biogenesis, and fuel utilization [214, 215]. L-arginine is implicated as a WAT browning agent due to its potential mechanisms of action: it is used by endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase to synthesise NO, which is capable of stimulating cGMP-PKG-dependent UCP1 transcription [115]. NO upregulation (by induction of endothelial NO synthase expression through calorie restriction) upregulates PGC-1α and other brown adipocyte genes, activates mitochondrial biogenesis, and increases respiration in mouse eWAT [216]. L-arginine supplementation increases cAMP production in both BAT and rpWAT [217] and an L-arginine-rich diet increases energy expenditure in rats and reduces energy intake efficiency, general indicators of increased expenditure through mitochondrial uncoupling; however no changes to UCP1 could be detected in WAT or BAT [218]. Alternatively, acute administration of L-ornithine, the metabolite of L-arginine, increases sympathetic flow to both BAT and eWAT [219], resulting in increased UCP1 protein expression in BAT (eWAT was not measured).

### 2.6.4 Ketone bodies

Ketone bodies (acetone, acetoacetic acid, and β-hydroxybutyrate) are produced in the liver from fatty acids during periods of carbohydrate restriction, for use in the body as a fuel when glucose levels are low. β-Hydroxybutyrate, but not acetoacetate or pyruvate, increases UCP1 expression in mouse white adipocytes [137]. In mice fed a diet in which carbohydrates were substituted with β-hydroxybutyrate, food

intake was reduced, BAT function and UCP1 protein levels increased [220], and eWAT UCP1 protein increased [221]. Further work is required to examine the role of ketone bodies in adipocyte browning.

#### 2.6.5 Nitrates

Inorganic nitrate (NO₃⁻) is found at high levels in leafy green vegetables and its presence is thought to be responsible for the cardioprotective effects of these foods, as well as potential antiobesity and antidiabetic properties. For example, in endothelial NOS knockout mice that are prone to developing the metabolic syndrome, nitrate administration reduces body weight and fat mass, reverses lipodystrophy, and improves glucose and insulin homeostasis [222]. In rats treated with nitrate in their drinking water, UCP1 mRNA levels are increased in iWAT depots, associated with an increase in multilocular lipid droplets and a reduction in body weight and visceral fat independent of effects on food intake [223]. Primary iWAT cultures treated chronically (but not acutely) with nitrate also show increased UCP1 mRNA levels, associated with increased basal and maximal respiration rates, fatty acid uptake, and β-oxidation [223]. The effect of nitrate is via conversion to nitrite and NO by xanthine oxidoreductase, and subsequent increases in cGMP levels leading to PKG activation [223]. The role of nitrate in human adiposity has not been evaluated but dietary nitrate has been shown to improve skeletal muscle mitochondrial efficiency in humans [224].

#### 2.6.6 Lipids

##### 2.6.6.1 Olive oil

Olive oil contains saturated (palmitic acid, stearic acid), monounsaturated (oleic acid, palmitoleic acid), and polyunsaturated (linoleic acid, α-linolenic acid) fats, as well as more than 30 phenolics including esters of tyrosol, hydroxytyrosol, oleocanthal, oleuropein, and elenolic acid. Oral administration of extra virgin olive oil or oleuropein increases BAT UCP1 mRNA levels in rats [225, 226], although the elevations in UCP1 mRNA are not associated with increased UCP1 protein levels and do not alter BAT oxygen consumption [226]. Despite this, whole-body oxygen consumption levels are elevated following olive oil consumption [226]. The olive oil component oleic acid has no effect on BAT or WAT UCP1 mRNA levels, but the synthetic derivative 2-hydroxyoleic acid decreases body weight and fat levels and increases WAT (but not BAT) UCP1 mRNA levels [227].

##### 2.6.6.2 Polyunsaturated fatty acids

Polyunsaturated fatty acids have been implicated in metabolic control, in particular ω-3 fatty acids. α-Linolenic acid is an essential ω-3 fatty acid that can be converted to additional ω-3

fatty acids, the most commonly studied being eicosapentanoic acid and docosahexanoic acid. ω-3 fatty acid intake has been implicated in the prevention of obesity, and in glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity [228]; however, human studies generally find that ω-3 fatty acids have some effect reducing adiposity but only improve weight loss in combination with dietary change [229–231].

ω-3 fatty acids increase UCP1 mRNA/protein expression and PPAR-γ, PGC-1α, and β₃-AR mRNA expression in mouse BAT, resulting in increased energy expenditure [232, 233]. In vitro stimulation of adipocytes derived from mouse iWAT with eicosapentanoic acid increased UCP1 and PGC-1α mRNA and mitochondrial content, although another common brown/brite marker, PRDM16, was unchanged [234]. The mechanism by which eicosapentanoic acid acts is poorly understood, but it does appear to involve activation of PPAR-α/γ [235, 236].

ω-6 fatty acids are also capable of binding to PPAR-α/γ [236]. Treatment with conjugated linoleic acid (an isomeric mix of ω-6 linoleic acid) reduces iWAT UCP1 mRNA in hamster [237] and UCP1 mRNA and protein in mice, but not rats [238], and reduces UCP1 mRNA content of brown adipocytes in vitro [226]. However, conjugated linoleic acid within a standard diet increases UCP1 mRNA and protein in mouse iWAT and eWAT, along with increased expression of brite adipocyte markers TMEM26 and CIDEA in both depots [239]; however, it was noted this effect was lost at a higher fatty acid content in food. Another ω-6 fatty acid, arachidonic acid, inhibits both rosiglitazone-induced UCP1 expression in human adipose-derived stem cell cultures and β₃-AR-induced browning in mouse iWAT [240]. The role of fatty acids, irrespective of saturation state, in the control of cellular metabolism has been reviewed extensively elsewhere [241], although the ability of other fatty acids to promote browning of WAT has yet to be investigated.

### 2.6.6.3 Retinoids

Retinoids are a family of compounds comprising β-carotene, vitamin A (otherwise known as retinol) and its metabolites, including retinoic acid. Retinoids specifically bind retinoic acid receptors (RARs); however, retinoid X receptors (RXRs) were also identified as targets, forming 1:1 heterodimers with RARs (reviewed in [242]). Upon ligand binding, RAR and RXR recruit coactivators to target transcription of a range of genes including many encoding proteins related to glucose and lipid metabolism [243–245]. Treatment with retinoids improves insulin resistance and hyperglycemia, and has antiobesity and antidiabetic effects [246–248]. The role of retinoids in adipose tissue has been recently reviewed elsewhere [249].

Retinoic acid administration in vivo increases UCP1 mRNA and protein expression in WAT depots in mice [250, 251], which is associated with antiobesity and antidiabetic effects in vivo [251]. Retinoic acid administration to cultured adipocytes (3T3-L1 adipocytes, C3H10T1/2 adipocytes, or MEFs) during differentiation also increases UCP1 mRNA

expression [250, 251], through a p38 MAPK-mediated mechanism [252] that is independent of PGC-1α [253]. While both of these studies agree that activation of RAR is involved, as the increase in UCP1 mRNA can be achieved with the RAR agonist TTNPB [250, 251], Mercader et al. were also able to increase UCP1 mRNA expression with the RXR agonist methoprene [252], although Berry et al. found no effect with the RXR-specific agonist 9cis-retinoic acid [251]. The functional significance of retinoic acid browning of WAT has recently been demonstrated [254]. As well as increasing expression of genes linked to mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription, mitochondrial biogenesis, and oxidative phosphorylation in 3T3-L1 adipocytes and mice, OCR were also increased, suggesting that retinoic acid increases mitochondrial content and function [254]. The role of retinoic acid in human adipocytes is not as convincing, with negligible effects observed [253].

#### 2.7 PPAR agonists

PPARs are nuclear receptors functioning as transcription factors. PPARs are divided into three classes, namely, PPAR-α, PPAR-β/δ, and PPAR-γ. All PPARs heterodimerize with RXRs and bind to peroxisome proliferator hormone response elements on the promoter region of many target genes. Endogenous ligands for PPARs include free fatty acids and eicosanoids.

PPAR-α regulates lipid metabolism and is mainly expressed in tissues that oxidize fatty acids at a fast rate, including the liver and BAT, and is therefore implicated in obesity and diabetes. Polymorphisms in the human PPAR-α gene are linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease [255, 256]. It is activated under conditions of energy deprivation/fasting, where it promotes uptake, utilization, and catabolism of fatty acids via a plethora of effects on gene transcription. It is activated by several pharmacological activators including bezafibrate, clofibrate, WY14623, and GW7647. Activation of PPAR-α in human and rodent WAT can lead to the upregulation of classical brown fat genes including UCP1 via a PGC-1α- and PRDM16-mediated mechanism [257–261] and induce mitochondrial biogenesis and fatty acid oxidation [261, 262]. Responses to the β₃-AR agonist CL316243 to increase UCP1 mRNA in white adipocytes are abolished in adipocytes from PPAR-α knockout mice [263].

PPAR-γ regulates fatty acid storage and glucose metabolism and is implicated in diseases such as obesity, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and cancer. It is activated by thiazolidinediones including rosiglitazone, pioglitazone, lobeglitazone, troglitazone, and ciglitazone. PPAR-γ is absolutely required for adipogenesis [264], and PPAR-γ agonists increase UCP1 mRNA and protein levels in mouse white adipocytes with increased norepinephrine induced thermogenesis [18, 265], increase UCP1 content and/or multilocularization in WAT in vivo [265–271], and increase UCP1 mRNA in human adipocytes [19, 262, 272]. This occurs through a

SIRT1-, PRDM16-, C/EBP-α-, and PGC-1α-mediated mechanism [265, 266, 273, 274]. PPAR-γ agonists have been used to successfully treat type 2 diabetes but their use recently has decreased due to reported adverse side effects. While rosiglitazone was thought to increase the risk of myocardial infarction [275], this finding has been reviewed and the FDA has concluded that rosiglitazone does not increase the risk of myocardial infarction compared with metformin and sulfonylurea [276]. Similarly, pioglitazone is no longer thought to increase the risk of bladder cancer [277].

### 2.8 Prostaglandins

Prostaglandins are fatty acid derivatives synthesized from diacylglycerol or phospholipids by phospholipases (phospholipase-C and phospholipase-A2) and COX1 or COX2 (COX is cyclooxygenase). They are ubiquitously expressed and act via GPCR prostaglandin receptors as autocrine or paracrine mediators. They are known to have a wide range of physiological functions regulating inflammation, immune response, tissue injury, and repair. Through COX2, thromboxane; prostacyclin; and prostaglandin D, I, E, and F are synthesized from arachidonic acid.

There is limited knowledge on prostaglandin roles in BAT function but COX2 appears to modulate the ability of BMP-6 to differentiate BAT [278]. More strikingly, prostaglandins have been shown to drive the development of brite adipocytes via an autocrine mechanism. Cold or β₃-AR agonists promote increased expression of COX2 in white adipocytes, leading to prostaglandin production and increasing UCP1 expression in white adipocytes; conversely, PGE2 and PGI2 themselves can increase UCP1 mRNA levels in iWAT but not in BAT [279, 280] and prostaglandins have a proposed role in white adipocyte differentiation by acting as PPAR-γ modulators [281]. A therapeutic role for COX2 comes from transgenic mice overexpressing the COX2 gene under the control of the promoter for the keratin 5 gene [279]. These mice have excess COX2 activity in WAT that results in increased UCP1, CIDEA, DIO2, and CPT1B expression; increased lipolysis; and increased multilocular lipid droplets in WAT [279]. These mice are also protected from diet-induced obesity, have improved glucose tolerance tests, and have reduced body weights and fat mass compared with their controls [279]. However, a recent study [240] showed that arachidonic acid, a precursor to PGE2 and PGI2, inhibits brite adipocyte formation in human multipotent adipose-derived stem cells and in mice whose diets were supplemented with arachidonic acid. More research is warranted to determine the role of prostaglandins on brite adipogenesis.

### 2.9 Thyroid hormone

The thyroid hormones, T3 and its prohormone, thyroxine (T4), are produced by the thyroid gland. They act at nuclear thyroid hormone receptors THR-α and THR-β to regulate gene expression, binding to hormone response elements in DNA as either monomers or heterodimers with the RXR. While T3 has a role in elevating UCP1 mRNA/protein levels in BAT, it has also been reported that treatment in vivo activates hypothalamic AMPK to promote sympathetic drive to BAT, thereby increasing UCP1 expression indirectly [51]. A recent review is available that covers the role of thyroid hormones in adipose tissue [282]. Its actions on browning of WAT are understudied but come from in vitro studies, avoiding this potential mechanism. T3 increases UCP1 mRNA levels in 3T3-L1 adipocytes via an AMPK-mediated mechanism [49]; and in human multipotent WAT cells, T3 increases UCP1 mRNA and protein levels, mitochondrial biogenesis, and OCR [50].

## 3 Agents that decrease browning of WAT

### 3.1 High-fat diet

Like exercise, the benefit of healthy diet on obesity and metabolic disease is indisputable. Often the correlation between obesity and thermogenesis or UCP1 expression has been made based on the effect of UCP1 deficiency on weight gain [62, 63]. However, the reciprocal relationship (the effect of weight gain on UCP1 expression) obviously bears interest in the context of diet-induced obesity and its treatment, as UCP1 expression in humans is negatively correlated with BMI [6] and primary cultures of sWAT from obese patients express less UCP1 [283].

HFD can lead to what is commonly termed diet-induced thermogenesis (DIT). This is distinct from acute thermogenic activation of BAT, where, through a spike in blood glucose or hormonal signaling to the brain, the bolus intake of energy within a single meal increases sympathetic outflow to BAT. After repeated meals, this may lead to some sustained upregulation of UCP1 expression [1]. DIT instead describes the apparent upregulation of UCP1 expression under obesogenic conditions. DIT remains a controversial topic and more information can be read elsewhere [284]. The effect of an HFD on UCP1 expression has been reviewed thoroughly [48], with the general finding that HFD induces an increase in UCP1 expression in rodent BAT, or alternatively induces a general increase in BAT mass, and with it total UCP1 content. Within these studies, HFD has variable effects (although no clear trend) between mouse strains with differences between obesity-prone and obesity-resistant mice [285–287]. There are also gender differences showing a greater UCP1 increase in BAT of male mice [288] and rats [289], and a potential role for leptin in HFD-induced UCP1 expression [290, 291], although the duration of HFD does not appear to be a factor as increased UCP1 is observed in as little as 48 h [292]. These studies are also generally performed at mean ambient temperatures of 20–23°C, which as outlined above would stimulate mild non-shivering adaptive thermogenesis; hence, true HFD-induced

effects may be obscured by ongoing temperature adaptations. Indeed, Rippe et al. observed an HFD-induced increase in BAT UCP1 mRNA at 23°C, but a decrease at 29°C [293].

There has been less reporting of the effects of HFD on UCP1 expression in WAT. Nevertheless, the clear consensus is reduced UCP1 in sWAT, and perhaps mesenteric WAT, but no change in other visceral WAT depots [48]. The results would appear to indicate an increase in adiposity within WAT in response to the increased availability of energy. Indeed, Wu et al. [47], investigating HFD and exercise training in Wistar rats, found that 8 wk on HFD without exercise increases iWAT, rpWAT, and eWAT mass that was associated with increased adipocyte size and a reduction in brite-associated UCP1 and PGC-1α mRNA content in iWAT and rpWAT. Furthermore, comparisons of obesity-prone (AKR/J) and obesity-resistant (SWR/J) mice showed no effects on UCP1 mRNA expression in SWR/J mice fed an HFD (despite an increase in BAT UCP1 mRNA), while AKR/J mice exhibited decreased UCP1 mRNA content in BAT, iWAT, and rpWAT [287]. In both cases eWAT fat pad mass was increased, but there was a lack of UCP1 expression even in control mice. A UCP1 mRNA decrease in iWAT in response to HFD has been widely observed [294–296]. No studies to date have directly measured the effect of HFD on UCP1 protein in WAT.

A significant factor in interpreting these results is the variability in the content of the HFD used. It has been suggested that the inconsistent increase in UCP1 in BAT may be due to the fatty acid content; however, there is clear agreement that brite adipocyte appearance is not increased but rather prevented in iWAT by HFD. Although a clear mechanism cannot be determined, increased adiposity is likely an adaptation to the increased availability of fatty acids and triglycerides.

### 3.2 TRPV4

Administration of the transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) Na⁺/Ca²⁺ channel agonist monoacylglycerol in vivo increases BAT UCP1 content and suppresses WAT accumulation in mice fed an HFD [297]. In contrast, TRPV4 plays a very different role, negatively regulating the expression of PGC-1α [298]. TRPV4 activation by the small molecule agonist GSK1016790A [299] inhibits UCP1 expression in 3T3-F442A adipocytes, and fails to activate p38 MAPK, but does activate ERK1/2 [298], likely indicating a proliferative effect opposing brite differentiation. Interestingly, antagonism of the TRPV4 channel (or shRNA knockdown) was capable of promoting UCP1 transcription [298].

## 4 Concluding remarks and future considerations

We have identified several considerations for ongoing research into brite adipocytes.

What is the ideal way to measure brite adipocytes (UCP1 mRNA ≠ protein/function)? Brite adipocytes are defined primarily by the emergence or increased expression of UCP1, but it has been strongly advocated that increases in UCP1 mRNA do not mean increased UCP1 protein or function: the cells still need to be activated [45]. Confirmation of browning should be based on examination of the level and distribution of UCP1 protein in conjunction with a functional output such as increased uncoupling of respiration.

Are the drug effects via a central or peripheral mechanism? We have tried to identify peripheral versus central actions of drugs administered in the in vivo studies. This limitation is answered in part by conducting studies using whole-animal models in conjunction with cultured adipocyte preparations.

Which mouse strain should be used? Several papers have highlighted the effect of HFD on multiple mouse strains [285–287, 291, 300–302], some strains being resistant to developing obesity on a HFD, while other mouse strains are highly sensitive to developing obesity on such a diet. This has implications in adipose tissue function, with obesogenic mouse strains having a lower thermogenic potential than obesity-resistant strains [65]. Additionally, many studies utilizing transgenic or knockout mice are predominately on a C57Bl/6J background, a less than optimal choice as these mice are particularly prone to diet-induced obesity [300, 301] and metabolic dysfunction [303].

Which WAT depot should we be investigating? A study by Walden et al. [29] concluded that “it is not realistic to think of adipose tissues as being either brown or white or even brown, brite, or white. Rather, each depot displays gene expression patterns that characterize that particular depot and probably determine its functional character as well.” Hence determining which WAT depot is to be investigated is of high importance, with the browning capability of iWAT greater than eWAT [26, 36].

At what temperature should we perform in vivo experiments? Keeping mice at thermoneutrality is imperative as mice housed at “room temperature” will show increased thermogenesis/metabolism and increased BAT activity, be protected from diet-induced obesity, show activated brite/beige adipocytes, and have altered insulin sensitivity in peripheral tissues [63, 304]. Only a handful of the in vivo studies reported in this review were performed at 30°C.

What adipogenic agents should be included in the cell culture media? The protocols used for generating primary brite adipocytes have predominately come from derivations of the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell culture protocol. That is to say, an adipogenic “cocktail” of drugs is used for brite adipocyte induction, but as listed above, most of these agents have been reported to be browning agents in their own right. This is of particular concern for studies on human derived adipocytes, as they require prolonged culture in adipogenic cocktail for lipid droplets to accumulate.

In conclusion, there are several potential pharmacological and nutritional approaches that promote the browning of WAT in vivo and in vitro in animal studies These cells

are an attractive target for pharmacotherapy of obesity and type 2 diabetes, and there is no doubt that the field will continue to expand rapidly. In many cases, the mechanism whereby a browning agent has its effect is unknown or ill-defined. We have highlighted limitations that researchers should consider when implementing experimental designs that test the capacity of agents to promote browning and subsequent activation of brite adipocytes.
