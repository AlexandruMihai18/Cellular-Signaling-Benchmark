# Mechanisms of aromatase inhibitor resistance

**Cynthia X. Ma¹, Tomás Reinert², Izabela Chmielewska³ and Matthew J. Ellis⁴**

Abstract | Oestrogen receptor-positive (ER⁺) breast cancer is a major cause of cancer death in women. Although aromatase inhibitors suppress the function of ER and reduce the risk of recurrence, therapeutic resistance is common and essentially inevitable in advanced disease. This Review considers both genomic and cell biological explanations as to why ER⁺ breast cancer cells persist, progress and cause an incurable, lethal, systemic disease. The design and outcomes of clinical trials are considered with the perspective that resistance mechanisms are heterogeneous, and therefore biomarker and somatic mutation-based stratification and eligibility will be essential for improvements in patient outcomes.

### Aromatase inhibitors (AIs). A class of drugs, including non-steroidal AIs (for example, anastrozole and letrozole), and steroidal AIs (for example, exemestane), that lower oestrogen levels by inhibiting the enzyme aromatase.

Ever since Beatson’s historic observation that breast tumours can regress following oophorectomy¹, oestrogen deprivation has been an important treatment for oestrogen receptor-positive (ER⁺) breast cancer. For postmenopausal women aromatase inhibitors (AIs; such as anastrozole, letrozole and exemestane) are the current standard-of-care for preventing relapse (which is referred to as adjuvant therapy) (FIG. 1), because several trials over the past two decades have demonstrated the superiority of AIs compared with tamoxifen². Recent studies have also indicated modestly increased efficacy for exemestane compared with tamoxifen as adjuvant treatment for premenopausal women when combined with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist (to reduce ovarian oestrogen synthesis)³. In advanced disease, AI therapy is the standard initial treatment but recent data on treatment with higher doses of the selective oestrogen receptor downregulator (SERD) fulvestrant have indicated that it is a promising alternative, with evidence for improved disease control and an emerging survival advantage against anastrozole⁴,⁵. Unfortunately, despite the potency of AI therapy, over 20% of patients with early-stage disease suffer a relapse, which can occur years or decades after diagnosis⁶. In patients with advanced or metastatic disease, although the majority derive benefit from initial endocrine approaches of any type, subsequent disease progression invariably occurs⁷.

Two general patterns of endocrine therapy resistance are recognized clinically: intrinsic resistance, whereby ER⁺ cancers never adequately respond to endocrine treatment, and acquired resistance, which develops following an initial response⁸. These clinical distinctions are not precise, however, and the underlying mechanisms between intrinsic and acquired resistance are likely to overlap. In addition, resistance to endocrine therapy may be agent-selective. For example, after failure of AI therapy, tumours can respond to other endocrine therapy approaches such as another AI of a different class (steroidal versus non-steroidal), oestrogen receptor modulators (tamoxifen) or SERDs (fulvestrant) and even physiological doses of oestradiol⁹.

Biological insights into the causes of AI resistance in ER⁺ breast cancer have developed fairly slowly and the aetiological events that drive the prolonged natural history of ER⁺ breast cancer, whereby the risk of recurrence persists for several decades, remain unclear. Although multi-gene assays provide an approach for the identification of low-risk, early-stage AI or tamoxifen-sensitive disease that is treatable with these agents alone (or in sequence), current expression profiling assays do not provide individualized treatment information for high-risk tumours beyond a recommendation for generic and only partially effective chemotherapy¹⁰. The use of gene expression profiling to assess the risk of developing AI-resistant breast cancer has been reviewed elsewhere¹¹. Genetically determined differences in endocrine drug metabolism, particularly of tamoxifen, are not considered in this Review, as these studies have yet to translate into clinical action or to improved patient outcomes and are not currently a major focus in the use of AI therapy¹². Improvements in therapeutic approaches for AI-resistant disease are therefore the focus of this Review, as success will directly stem from the rich database of biological and genomic insights into the pathogenesis of ER⁺ breast

cancer and the biological consequences of targeting oestrogen-dependent transcription by oestrogen deprivation.

**AI resistance in early-stage disease**  
Although endocrine therapy resistance in advanced disease is clinically obvious and is associated with incurability, the detection (or prediction) of AI resistance in primary tumours before relapse remains a crucial research endeavour because early-stage disease is still within the ‘curability window’. Therapeutically addressing AI-resistance mechanisms early in the course of disease is inherently more likely to improve the cure rate because treatment when the disease burden is lower has a reduced probability of a pre-existing AI resistance mutation or subclone that could drive relapse^{13–15}.

A direct but investigational approach to the diagnosis of endocrine therapy resistance in primary tumours is to assess the Ki67 proliferation index as early as 2–4 weeks, or any time afterwards, following the initiation of neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (typically an AI^{16,17} (BOX 1)). Continued Ki67 expression despite AI treatment identifies oestrogen-independent proliferation that is clearly associated with an increased risk of disease recurrence and death^{16,18–20}. A cut-off point of 10% Ki67 expression on-treatment has been used to define sensitive versus intrinsically resistant patient populations for the purposes of genomic discovery and clinical trial design^{20,21}. Clearly, other definitions could also be valid, such as the fall in Ki67 expression from baseline, although the measurement of Ki67 expression at two time points rather than one increases assay variability, which remains a problem with Ki67 immunohistochemistry (IHC)^{18,19}. The ACOSOG Z1031 Cohort B trial successfully pioneered a tailored treatment strategy based on real-time central Ki67 assessment on tumour biopsies taken at 2–4 weeks following neoadjuvant AI therapy to triage patients to neoadjuvant chemotherapy if the proportion of cells in the biopsy sample that were Ki67+ remained above 10%. Preliminary data from this trial indicated that about 20% of patients are in this intrinsic AI-resistance category and the feasibility of using on-treatment Ki67 to identify endocrine-resistant disease in the neoadjuvant setting for triage to alternative therapy is underway^{10,22}.

Ki67 expression at surgery following neoadjuvant AI therapy, in addition to three other independent prognostic factors, pathological tumour size, lymph node status and ER level, has also been incorporated into a prognostic tool: the preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI)^{17} (BOX 1), which further distinguishes endocrine therapy-sensitive from therapy-resistant tumours to guide systemic adjuvant therapy. In the P024 and IMPACT neoadjuvant endocrine therapy trials the early relapse rate was very low in patients with a PEPI score of 0 (pathological stage 1 or 2A, tumour Ki67<2.7%, ER+)^{17}. The 2.7% cut-off point was derived from the finding that each natural logarithm increase in the proportion of cells in a biopsy sample with Ki67 expression was associated

**Figure 1 | Mechanism of action of Als.** In premenopausal women, the ovaries are the major source of oestrogen, and oestrogen biosynthesis is regulated by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland via the actions of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). In postmenopausal women, oestrogen is synthesized in peripheral tissues such as adipose tissue, breasts and skin through the action of aromatase, which converts androstenedione and testosterone released from ovaries and adrenal glands to oestrone and oestradiol, respectively. In addition, oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer cells could express aromatase, leading to intratumoural oestrogen production. In postmenopausal women, aromatase inhibitors (Als) effectively reduce oestrogen production. In premenopausal women, however, the reduced oestrogen levels by Als induce feedback stimulation of the hypothalamus–pituitary–ovary axis; therefore, ovarian function suppression by GnRH agonists or ovarian ablation such as oophorectomy is required for Als to be used in premenopausal women.

**Box 1 | Diagnosis of AI resistance in early-stage breast cancer**

Intrinsic resistance can be diagnosed at 2–4 weeks following the initiation of neoadjuvant aromatase inhibitor (AI) therapy if tumour Ki67 levels are over 10%. This strategy (see the figure) is being used in clinical trials of neoadjuvant AI therapies to identify patients with resistant tumours for whom treatment with chemotherapy or participation in clinical trials of novel therapies is recommended.

The preoperative endocrine prognostic index (PEPI) score following 4–6 months of neoadjuvant AI or other endocrine therapy provides another strategy to identify endocrine-sensitive versus endocrine-resistant tumours in the early-stage setting. A PEPI score of 0 (pT1/2, node-negative (N0), Ki67<2.7%, oestrogen receptor-positive (ER+)) is being investigated prospectively as a surrogate of endocrine therapy-sensitive disease that does not need chemotherapy, and a PEPI of >0 identifies patients with an increased risk of relapse. The hazard ratio (HR) of each surgical factor for relapse-free survival (RFS) and assigned PEPI points based on the data from the P024 trial are shown in the table.

| Surgical factors | RFS HR | PEPI score |

with a significantly increased risk of relapse, with the lowest risk associated with a natural logarithm of the Ki67 value of 1 (2.7%) or less, or in the rare patient with a pathological complete response (pCR). However, PEPI scores above zero (either because of a high disease burden at surgery, or high Ki67 levels, or both) were associated with an incrementally higher risk of relapse. The occurrence rate of PEPI-0 tumours in neoadjuvant AI therapy trials ranges from 17% to 37%. Patients with PEPI-0 tumours represent a low-risk population that could be potentially treated with endocrine monotherapy; that is, no chemotherapy [17,23].

The ongoing Alliance A011106 trial (also known as the ALTERNATE trial) is testing this concept, and this investigation will prospectively validate the hypothesis that PEPI-0 status is associated with a 5-year relapse risk of less than 5% without the administration of chemotherapy (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01953588). The Alliance A011106 trial will also identify more effective neoadjuvant endocrine therapy regimens by randomizing patient treatment between fulvestrant, anastrozole or a combination of both for 24 weeks before surgery and by assessing the PEPI-0 rate on each arm. An important aspect of the trial is the identification of

patients with intrinsically resistant tumours, defined by Ki67 levels of above 10% in tumour biopsy samples at 4 or 12 weeks or by a PEPI score of above 0 at surgery for chemotherapy or an investigational approach. The genomic analysis of fulvestrant or AI-resistant tumours and targeting them on the basis of their mutational profile is clearly the next step in this therapeutic strategy.

Ongoing genomic analyses are also underway for endocrine therapy-resistant tumours in the advanced disease setting to identify progression or resistance mutations and therapeutic targets. Research to produce a cure for advanced disease is much more daunting and the acquisition of tumour samples for analysis is more difficult. Nonetheless, survival improvement for patients with advanced disease could translate into better cure rates in adjuvant trials and new technologies such as circulating tumour DNA analysis may circumvent the need for a tissue biopsy for somatic mutation diagnosis [24].

### Somatic mutation patterns

To uncover relationships between somatic mutation patterns and the effectiveness of AI treatment of primary luminal breast cancer, massively parallel sequencing of 77 pretreatment tumour biopsy samples from patients treated with neoadjuvant AI therapy was conducted [21]. This study identified 18 significantly mutated genes (SMGs), including PI3K catalytic subunit-α (PIK3CA), TP53 (which encodes p53), GATA3, E-cadherin (CDH1), retinoblastoma (RB1), mixed lineage leukaemia 3 (MLL3; also known as KMT2C), MAP3K1, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B; which encodes p27), T-box 3 (TBX3), runt-related transcription factor 1 (RUNX1), low-density lipoprotein receptor adaptor protein 1 (LDLRAP1), stathmin 2 (STMN2), myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9), angiotensin II receptor type 2 (AGTR2), splicing factor 3b, subunit 1 (SF3B1) and core-binding factor-β subunit (CBFB) [21]. In addition, a variety of structural variations including copy number alterations, deletions, translocations and inversions were identified. The number of SMGs in ER+ breast cancer was further extended to more than 30 by the work of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA; see Further information) [25]. The complexity of the genomic data presents serious challenges for biostatistical analysis. The biological insights into the remarkable functional diversity of the luminal breast cancer-associated SMGs are only slowly emerging because many of these genes have never previously been linked to the development of breast cancer.

An important follow-on approach for unravelling the importance of luminal breast cancer-associated SMGs is to conduct targeted sequencing studies in a larger number of samples in which treatment is controlled and long-term clinical outcomes are well documented. Although these studies are mostly pending, within the context of neoadjuvant AI trials, this approach has produced some preliminary data on the clinical importance of three of the highest frequency SMGs: TP53, MAP3K1 and GATA3. TP53 mutations were correlated with the luminal B subtype and high Ki67 levels before and after treatment, whereas mutations in MAP3K1 associated with the

luminal A subtype and low levels of Ki67 throughout the treatment course²¹. Interestingly, GATA3 mutation correlated with greater Ki67 suppression after AI treatment but not with baseline Ki67 levels, suggesting that GATA3 mutation is a predictive marker for AI response²¹. Further verification of these results will require the analysis of samples with long-term follow-up to confirm the hypothesis that patients carrying tumours with MAP3K1 or GATA3 mutations will have a favourable outcome, whereas those with TP53 mutation will have worse outcomes. Using an informatics tool to dissect pathway activation events (PARADIGM), MAP2K4 mutations were also found to be potentially associated with favourable features (such as luminal A and low PEPI scores), which is logical as MAP2K4 is a substrate for MAP3K1. In addition, TP53, BIRC6, CDKN1B, RUNX1 and the long non-coding RNA MALAT1 were connected to high Ki67 values and luminal B status through pathway informatics²⁶ (FIG. 2). Various pathway analyses were also conducted to gain additional insights into the AI-resistance process. PathScan analysis indicated that these somatic mutations affected the caspase cascade and apoptosis, ERBB2, AKT-PI3K-mTOR, p53-RB and MAPK-JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways²¹ (FIGS 3,4). Further PARADIGM analysis for pathway signature identification indicated that p53, MYC, FYN, MAPK, JUN,

histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), SHC1 and the hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α)-aryl hydrocarbon receptor nuclear translocator (ARNT; also known as HIF1β) complex were associated with high on-treatment Ki67 expression levels. These findings are consistent with earlier work on the relationship between proliferation and a hypoxia metagene in AI-treated ER⁺ breast cancer²⁷.

In general, these data support the hypothesis that AI resistance is encoded by the mutation patterns present in individual tumour genomes, but detailed and validated information is yet to emerge. Overall, the mutational maps developed from neoadjuvant AI studies emphasize the genomic heterogeneity that underlies the clinical heterogeneity of the disease (FIGS 3,4). The next phase of this research is to screen a much larger number of samples to determine the endocrine phenotype of recurrent somatic mutations in luminal-type breast cancer and to understand how their interactions promote prognosis, patterns of metastasis and drug response. Drug targets and biological investigations are expected to be prioritized in these studies on the basis of somatic events that lead to poor outcome. It is also possible that clinically useful AI resistance and sensitivity classifications based on somatic mutation patterns may emerge.

ESR1 alterations

ESR1 point mutation. Oestrogen receptor 1 (ESR1; which encodes ERα) mutation in the region corresponding to the carboxy-terminal ligand-binding domain of the protein (FIG. 5a) is an acquired AI-resistance mechanism. These mutations were identified through the analysis of ER⁺ advanced disease samples obtained from patients whose disease had progressed despite long-term endocrine therapy and also from patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) derived from this patient population²⁸⁻³¹,³⁴⁻³⁷. ESR1 mutation has been hypothesized to be a mechanism of AI resistance since the 1990s³². This hypothesis was initially overlooked because mutations in ESR1 are rare in treatment-naive primary breast cancer. In a study of eight ESR1 protein-coding exons from 118 ER⁺ and 70 ER⁻ primary breast cancers, only two missense mutations (encoding N69K and M396V) were identified, both in the same ER⁻ breast tumour³³. Similarly, no mutations in ESR1 were identified from the sequencing of 390 ER⁺ primary breast cancers by TCGA²⁵. However, a high frequency (ranging from 11% to 55%) of ESR1 mutation was identified in metastatic disease samples, especially in studies of tumours that have progressed on serial endocrine therapy that includes an AI³¹,³⁴⁻³⁷.

Most patients with tumours harbouring ESR1 mutations experienced a protracted clinical course before sample collection for sequencing. Importantly, the ESR1 mutations were absent in the matched primary tumours at diagnosis, supporting the idea that ESR1 mutation is generally an acquired resistance mechanism that emerges after long-term treatment with endocrine therapy. The mutations cluster in the ligand-binding domain (LBD) with Y537S, C or N and D538G being the most common. These mutations confer ligand (oestrogen)-independent target gene activation and

cell proliferation in preclinical studies ${ }^{31,34-36}$. Structural modelling of the mutant ERs demonstrates a constitutive agonist conformation through the formation of hydrogen bonds between S537 or G538 and N351 in helix 12 (REF. 34). In preclinical studies, treatment with tamoxifen and fulvestrant was effective, but higher drug concentrations were required. This suggests that clinical studies of anti-oestrogen dose escalation or potent ER downregulators should be considered for patients with $ESR1$-mutant tumours.

**ESR1 translocation.** An additional, recently uncovered genetic endocrine therapy resistance mechanism is $ESR1$ chromosomal translocation (FIG. 5b). Several in-frame fusion genes preserving the first six or seven exons of $ESR1$ (e6 or e7), including the DNA-binding domain and hinge region, spliced in-frame into the C terminus of another gene, have been identified to date. Examples of these other genes include Yes-associated protein 1 ($ESR1^{e6}$-$YAP1$), DNA polymerase-η ($ESR1^{e7}$-$POLH$),

and A kinase anchor protein 12 ($ESR1^{e6}$-$AKAP12$) ${ }^{31,38}$. The $ESR1^{e6}$-$YAP1$ fusion gene is best documented, as the corresponding fusion gene was identified in an endocrine therapy-resistant PDX model derived from the breast tumour of a patient presenting with primary endocrine therapy-resistant stage IV breast cancer. In transfection studies, $ESR1^{e6}$-$YAP1$ induced strong hormone-independent growth and activation of classic oestradiol-regulated genes (such as trefoil factor 1 ($TFF1$) and progesterone receptor ($PGRG$)) ${ }^{31}$. Thus, the YAP1 sequences effectively mimic the ligand-activated transactivation domain in the C terminus of ERα.

Another class of translocation involving $ESR1$ involves localized gene rearrangements on chromosome 6 between $ESR1$ and coiled-coil domain containing 170 (CCDC170). CCDC170 resides immediately centromeric to $ESR1$. These fusions join the 5' untranslated region and promoter of $ESR1$ to the coding region of CCDC170, generating the overexpression of amino-terminally truncated ΔCCDC170 proteins. These gene fusion events were

inhibitor in experimental models with the subsequent restoration of oestradiol-induced growth³⁹. The hypothesis provoked by this observation is that a SRC inhibitor could be used to restore endocrine therapy sensitivity, and this idea is supported by a Phase II clinical trial of the SRC inhibitor dasatinib⁴⁰ (TABLE 1).

The prevalence of *ESR1* amplification in breast cancer has been the subject of controversy, as it has been reported to occur either rarely or at rates of up to 20% in different studies⁴¹⁻⁵¹. The variability of the data could be a result of non-standardized detection methodologies, which have inconsistent sensitivity, specificity and cutoff point⁴⁷,⁵². Similar to the *ESR1* mutation story, *ESR1* amplification may be more common in AI-resistant metastatic tumours, and this should be investigated.

Overall, *ESR1* alteration, whether point mutation, translocation or amplification, is likely to drive acquired resistance to AI treatment, less commonly intrinsic resistance, and represents an opportunity for clinical trials specific to this population. Unlike ERα, the role of ERβ in endocrine responsiveness is much less well understood. Some researchers have proposed that ERβ is associated with responsiveness to endocrine therapy⁵³,⁵⁴, whereas others have found that ERβ expression led to endocrine treatment resistance⁵⁵. Thus, the role of ERβ in AI resistance remains an unresolved issue.

### Crosstalk between GFR signalling and ER

The aberrant activation of growth factor receptors (GFRs), including ERBB family receptors⁵⁶,⁵⁷, fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1)⁵⁸ and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R)⁵⁹,⁶⁰, and their downstream signalling components, including MAPKs⁶¹,⁶² and the PI3K-AKT pathway⁶³,⁶⁴, has been associated with acquired endocrine therapy resistance⁶⁵ (FIG. 6). The dynamic interplay between GFR signalling and ER expression has long been the subject of study⁶⁶. Several investigations have demonstrated that overexpression of GFR signalling through epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or HER2 (also known as ERBB2) activates MAPK in ER⁺ breast cancer, leading to the loss of ERα expression⁶⁶⁻⁶⁸, and inhibition of MAPK can reactivate ER expression and tumour responsiveness to endocrine therapy⁶⁹. In addition, activation of GFR drives downstream kinases to phosphorylate ERα at key positions, including S118, S167 and T311, to promote interactions with major co-activators, including amplified in breast cancer 1 (AIB1; also known as SRC3 and NCOA3), and to recruit CREB-binding protein (CBP; also known as CREBBP) and p300 to the ER complex to activate transcription⁷⁰,⁷¹. There are several additional ways that these phosphorylation-enhanced co-activator interactions could drive hormone-independent and/or AI-resistant growth, including enhancement of the non-genomic functions of ERα, whereby ERα has growth-promoting functions in the plasma membrane in association with EGFR⁷² and IGF1R⁷³.

Another emerging field concerns the modulation of the unstructured nature of the activation function 1 (AF1) transactivation domain in the N terminus of ERα.

Synthetic lethality
The simultaneous perturbation of two genes or processes that results in cellular or organism death, whereas loss of either alone does not.

Phosphorylation of S118 by MAPK and CDK7 (REF. 74) is thought to be crucial for promoting an active AF1 conformation, with recent data showing recruitment of peptidyl prolyl cis–trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (PIN1) at this phosphorylation site. PIN1 expression is correlated with the proliferative status of experimental tumours and promotes ligand-independent activity. These emerging data suggest that pathogenic AF1 activation mechanisms continue to be an important area of investigation<sup>75</sup>. Indeed, dual inhibition of both the ligand-dependent (AF2) domain of ERα and the AF1 domain, is thought to be a key advantage of the use of SERDs, such as fulvestrant<sup>76</sup>. This could explain why fulvestrant can have therapeutic activity after the development of AI-resistant disease.

In preclinical studies, combined targeting of ER and the aberrantly activated GFR signalling pathway is often required to maximize treatment efficacy<sup>63,77</sup>. Interestingly, the activation of GFR signalling influences genome-wide ER DNA-binding patterns — the ‘ER cistrome’ (REF. 78) — which is distinct from the classical oestrogen-induced ER-binding sites<sup>79–81</sup>. This is likely to be important because these alterations in the ER-binding programme have been predictive of poor clinical outcome<sup>82</sup>. Furthermore, membrane-bound ER can promote the phosphorylation of signal transduction components (for example, SRC), leading to a debate regarding the relative importance of the genomic, that is, transcriptional, role of ER versus the non-genomic signalling role of ER in the biology of endocrine therapy resistance<sup>83</sup>. Clinical investigations of GFR pathway inhibitors in combination with endocrine therapy in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer are ongoing, with evidence of a positive benefit when HER2-targeted agents and endocrine therapies are combined in ER<sup>+</sup> HER2<sup>+</sup> breast cancer, as shown in several clinical trials<sup>65,84–87</sup>. Unfortunately, these HER2-targeted agents have not been as successful when HER2 has not been overexpressed or amplified<sup>88</sup>, and inhibitors against other GFRs, including EGFR and IGF1R, have been disappointing in early phase clinical trials<sup>65,89,90</sup>. The limited ability to dissect the complex mechanisms that lead to endocrine resistance in clinical samples and the lack of predictors of response are among the barriers to progress. From the pharmacological standpoint, feedback mechanisms that are activated in the presence of tyrosine kinase inhibitors may reduce efficacy<sup>91</sup>. An alternative strategy is to target HER2 mutations that, although rare, occur more commonly in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer than in ER<sup>-</sup> breast cancer. A trial with neratinib in HER2-mutant disease is ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01670877), and a combination study of an endocrine agent with neratinib is a logical proposition<sup>92</sup>.

PI3K pathway in ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer
Components of the PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway are frequently altered in breast cancer<sup>93</sup> and mutation in the α-catalytic subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA; which encodes p110α) is the most frequent genetic abnormality in luminal-type breast cancer (occurring at a frequency of 30%–40%)<sup>21,25</sup>. There is a relationship between favourable prognosis and PIK3CA mutation, but the correlation is modest and does not diminish the importance of this eminently druggable target<sup>94,95</sup>. ER<sup>+</sup> breast cancer cells with PIK3CA mutation are highly dependent on the PIK3CA-encoded protein p110α for cell survival *in vitro*, as genetically ablating p110α expression or the use of p110α inhibitors can induce apoptosis, particularly when combined with an ER-targeting approach<sup>63,77</sup>. Activation of the PI3K pathway has been shown to regulate ER expression<sup>96</sup>. Activated PI3K phosphorylates the transcription factor forkhead box O3A (FOXO3A), preventing the nuclear localization of FOXO3A and binding to the ESR1 promoter. Thus, inhibition of PI3K induces ER expression through FOXO3A<sup>97–99</sup>. This might explain the synthetic lethality of combined PI3K and ER inhibition<sup>77</sup>. In addition, studies of long-term oestrogen-deprived (LTED) breast cancer cell lines have documented the activation of the PI3K pathway in the development of acquired endocrine resistance<sup>63,64,100</sup>.

Targeting mTOR has been one of the few clinical success stories in the treatment of AI resistance (TABLE 1). For patients with resistance to non-steroidal AIs (anastrozole or letrozole), the addition of the rapamycin analogue everolimus to the steroidal AI exemestane (BOLERO-2 trial)<sup>101</sup>

Figure 5 | **ESR1 mutation and ESR1-YAP1 translocation.** A schematic diagram (part **a**) of oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) mutations and their frequencies in ER<sup>+</sup> metastatic breast cancer after therapy with aromatase inhibitors (AIs) and other endocrine agents (combined data from five studies<sup>34,35,37,179,180</sup>). The structural domains of ERα are shown, including the transcription activation function 1 (AF1) domain, the DNA-binding domain (DBD), the receptor dimerization and nuclear localization (hinge) domain, and the ligand-binding domain (LBD) and AF2 domain. The WW protein–protein interaction domains in Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) are also shown in part **b**. Mutations in the LBD cause oestrogen-independent activation of ERα and therefore resistance to oestrogen deprivation therapy such as aromatase inhibition. Mutations at Y537 were not always enumerated as to whether they were S, Y or N and therefore the data were compiled together for the figure. A balanced translocation (part **b**) between 6q and 11q was observed in a patient-derived xenograft model of an AI- and a fulvestrant-resistant tumour that created a transcript encoding the 5′ six exons of ESR1 (which encodes amino acids 1–365 of ERα) that preserved the AF1, DBD and hinge domain, fused to the carboxyl terminus of YAP1 (amino acids 230–504). The substitution of the LBD of ERα by YAP1 sequences leads to oestrogen-independent signalling and AI and anti-oestrogen resistance.

or to tamoxifen (TAMRAD)¹⁰² demonstrated improvements in progression-free survival. However, feedback activation of AKT as a result of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) inhibition probably limits the efficacy of everolimus, and patients in the BOLERO-2 trial did not experience improved overall survival¹²³⁻¹⁰⁵. More potent approaches to PI3K–AKT–mTOR pathway inhibition are available, and several other inhibitors of AKT or PI3K, including the pan-PI3K isoform inhibitors, dual PI3K and mTOR inhibitors, and PI3K-isoform-specific inhibitors are under investigation¹⁰⁶. The identification of predictive biomarkers for mTOR inhibition remains an unmet need, as targeted sequencing efforts in the BOLERO-2 trial failed to show a relationship between somatic mutation patterns and clinical outcomes¹⁰⁷. The relationship between PIK3CA and other mutations and the efficacy of the next generation of PI3K pathway-targeting agents will probably have to be addressed prospectively. Trials in which PIK3CA mutation status is an eligibility criterion are currently underway.

### Targeting cell cycle regulation

Analyses by TCGA demonstrated a significant association between deregulated cyclin D–CDK4 or CDK6–RB pathway and luminal B breast cancer²⁵. These higher risk breast cancers are enriched for cyclin D1 (CCND1) amplification (58% in luminal B versus 29% in luminal A), gain of CDK4 (25% in luminal B versus 14% in luminal A), and loss of negative regulators such as CDKN2A (which encodes p16) and CDKN2C (which encodes p18)²⁵, all of which could lead to oestrogen-independent cell cycle progression. In addition, various mitogenic or growth factor receptor signalling pathways converge on the cyclin D–CDK4 or CDK6–RB axis, and the activation of CDK4 or CDK6, which leads to RB phosphorylation, was associated with resistance to endocrine therapy¹⁰⁸. As a result, CDK4–CDK6 inhibitors have the potential to improve the efficacy of endocrine therapy¹⁰⁹. Improvement in progression-free survival has been observed in a clinical trial of palbociclib, a selective inhibitor of the CDK4–CDK6 kinases, in combination with letrozole versus letrozole alone¹¹⁰,¹¹¹. As this was a first-line trial, many of the tumours in this study would have had relatively endocrine therapy-sensitive disease, and so these agents could be delaying the onset of resistance rather than reversing established resistance. The letrozole palbociclib combination recently received conditional approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Another potential approach to achieve cell cycle control in endocrine-resistant ER+ breast cancer is to therapeutically increase the function of p53. This approach takes advantage of the fact that mutations in TP53 are relatively infrequent in ER+ breast cancer (TP53 mutations occur in 30% of luminal B and 12% of luminal A tumours) compared with basal-like breast cancer (at least 80% of which have TP53 mutations). However, the expression of p53 may be reduced at the protein level owing to amplification of E3 ligases that degrade the p53 protein. An excellent example is MDM2, for which gene copy gain was shown to occur in 30% of luminal B tumours and in 14% of luminal A tumours in TCGA analyses²⁵. Inhibitors of MDM2 increase the expression of the CDK inhibitor p21 and induce cell cycle arrest in experimental systems. At least one example of an MDM2 inhibitor (MI-773) is currently in early-stage clinical trials¹¹².

### Epigenetic regulators of ESR1

Sequencing analysis, functional studies and clinical trial results all point to a role for aberrant histone and DNA modifications in endocrine therapy resistance and ER+ breast cancer pathogenesis. Mutations in MLL3, a gene encoding a DNA-binding protein that methylates histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4), occur at a frequency of 7% in luminal breast cancer²⁵. In addition, an array of coding mutations and structural variations occur in other methyltransferase-encoding genes, MLL2 (also known as KMT2B), MLL4 (also known as KMT2D) and MLL5 (also known as KMT2E), as well as demethylases (KDM6A, KDM4A, KDM5B and KDM5C), acetyltransferases (MYST1 (also known as KAT8), MYST3 (also known as KAT6A) and MYST4 (also known as KAT6B)) and several AT-rich interactive domain-containing protein genes: ARID1A, ARID2, ARID3B and ARID4B²⁵. The accumulation of these mutations in luminal-type breast cancer implies that they may alter the function of ER in a way that promotes carcinogenesis. It also seems likely that the pattern of these mutations could be an

Oestrogen-bound oestrogen receptor (ER), in association with a variety of co-activators (CoAs) (part a) and co-repressors (CoRs) (part b), exerts its classical genomic action as a transcription factor through the oestrogen response element (ERE) of target genes. ER can also mediate an ERE-independent genomic effect via interaction with other transcription factors, such as AP1, through AP1-binding sites of target genes (part c). In addition, ER can be activated via plasma membrane crosstalk with other growth factor receptor (GFR) pathways that phosphorylate (P) ER or its co-regulators. GFRs—for example, HER2, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) and fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)—undergo phosphorylation and dimerization upon ligand activation, which triggers their intracellular association with the regulatory subunit (p85) of PI3K, either directly or indirectly via an intermediate adaptor molecule such as insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1). This releases the inhibitory effect of p85 on the catalytic subunit p110 of PI3K. PI3K converts phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate (PIP3), which allows the activation of AKT and downstream signalling components of the PI3K pathway to promote cell growth, proliferation and survival. PTEN and inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) are two phosphatases that negatively regulate the PI3K pathway by dephosphorylating PIP3 and PIP2, respectively. In addition, activation of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) also activates the MAPK pathway. PI3K and MAPK pathway activation leads to phosphorylation of ER and ER coregulators. Cyclin D1 is a direct transcription target of ER or other GFR signalling pathways. Cyclin D1 activates cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6, which phosphorylates RB, which releases the E2F transcription factors and activates the expression of genes required for the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle. CDK4 and CDK6 are negatively regulated by specific and universal inhibitors including p16, p18, p21 and p27. p53 negatively regulates the cell cycle through the activation of p21. MDM2 inhibits p53 function. RB and p53 are important mediators of apoptosis and/or senescence with intrinsic or extrinsic signals such as genotoxic stress. The crosstalk between ER and GFR signalling, as well as constitutive activation of their downstream effectors, are potential mechanisms of oestrogen-independent cell growth of ER+ breast cancer, leading to aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance. 4EBP1, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1; AMPK, AMP-activated protein kinase; ASK1, apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1; BAD, BCL-2-associated agonist of cell death; elF4, eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4; FOXO, forkhead box protein O; GRB2, growth factor receptor-bound protein 2; GSK3, glycogen synthase kinase 3; JNK, JUN N-terminal kinase; LKB1, liver kinase B1; mTORC, mTOR complex; PDK1, 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase 1; RHEB, RAS homologue enriched in brain; SHIP, SH2 domain-containing inositol 5′ phosphatase.

important determinant in endocrine therapy responsiveness, as well as targets for epigenetic therapy (as discussed below). However, this remains a mostly unexplored area of research.

At the level of DNA methylation, it is well established that epigenetic transcriptional silencing of *ESR1* occurs as a result of closed or compact nucleosome structure due to the methylation of CpG islands in the *ESR1* promoter ${ }^{113,114}$. However, histone deacetylation can also contribute to the loss of *ESR1* expression ${ }^{113-117}$. Treatment of ER${}^{-}$ human breast cancer cell lines with an HDAC inhibitor or a DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) inhibitor leads to the re-expression of *ESR1* mRNA ${ }^{114,116,118-121}$, with synergism observed for these two classes of agents when combined in cell culture studies ${ }^{116,119}$. HDAC inhibitors were also capable of restoring endocrine sensitivity in resistant ER${}^{+}$ breast cancer cells ${ }^{122}$. However, the mechanisms of action of HDAC inhibition are complex ${ }^{123}$. For example, HDAC inhibitors have been shown to deplete EGFR expression and downstream signalling ${ }^{121}$, to induce the expression of p21 (also known as WAF), an important inhibitor of CDKs, and to inhibit p21-activated kinase 1 (PAK1), a Ser/Thr kinase that functions downstream of RAS ${ }^{122,124}$. Initial success of HDAC inhibitors has been reported in Phase II clinical trials in patients with metastatic ER${}^{+}$ breast cancers progressing despite endocrine therapies, and larger studies are ongoing ${ }^{125,126}$.

### Resistance to cell death

Pharmacological interventions to activate cell death to enhance the efficacy of endocrine therapy are of great interest, as acquired resistance to AIs would be circumvented if ER${}^{+}$ cells could be induced to die rather than simply to stop proliferating pending a reactivation event (such as a rise in oestradiol owing to the termination of AI therapy or a mutation in the ER$\alpha$ LBD). Increased expression of BCL-2 and/or BCL-W (also known as BCL2L2) has been shown to correlate with endocrine therapy resistance ${ }^{127}$. Inhibitors of BCL-2 induced both apoptosis and autophagy in endocrine therapy-resistant breast cancer cells in preclinical models ${ }^{128}$.

Other small-molecule inhibitors targeting nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B), which have been implicated in apoptosis evasion, and inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs), which are key negative regulators of the terminal effectors caspase 3 and caspase 7, are also being developed ${ }^{129,130}$. Interestingly, cIAP1 (also known as BIRC2) may be pharmacologically engaged for the degradation of ER therapeutically ${ }^{131}$. In addition, the activation of cIAP2 (also known as BIRC3) by inflammatory cytokines from immune cells in the stroma could help to explain the resistance of ER${}^{+}$ breast cancer cells to apoptosis, and suggests a possible therapeutic use for IAP inhibition ${ }^{132}$. Bortezomib is a nonspecific proteasome inhibitor that blocks the NF-$\kappa$B pathway, among others, and its combination with fulvestrant in AI-resistant disease is under investigation ${ }^{104}$ (TABLE 1).

#### Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT)

A process by which epithelial cells lose their cell polarity and cell–cell adhesion, and gain migratory and invasive properties.

#### Induction of stem cell-like features

Cancer stem cell-like properties have also been reported in ER${}^{+}$ disease and there is clearly a potential role for this pathway to be involved in adaptive or acquired resistance. Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are intrinsically resistant to treatment because they are characterized by certain biological features, such as induction of a G0 state ${ }^{133}$; overexpression of proteins associated with drug efflux and metabolism ${ }^{134,135}$; high levels of anti-apoptotic proteins such as survivin and the BCL-2 family ${ }^{136}$; deregulation of signalling pathways including Notch ${ }^{137}$, Hedgehog (HH) ${ }^{138}$, WNT, PI3K–AKT and others ${ }^{129,139}$; and enhanced DNA damage responses ${ }^{140,141}$. The existence of CSCs in breast cancer is supported by the identification of a CD44${}^{+}$CD24${}^{-}$ subpopulation of tumour cells that are capable of self-renewal and tumour initiation ${ }^{142,143}$. In ER${}^{+}$ breast cancers, these CD44${}^{+}$CD24${}^{-}$ CSCs show low or absent ER expression and increased PI3K pathway signalling ${ }^{144,145}$, both of which are associated with AI resistance. Gene expression analysis of residual tumours following neoadjuvant letrozole treatment indicated a significant increase in the CD44${}^{+}$CD22${}^{-/low}$ mammosphere signature and an elevated expression of mesenchymal-associated genes ${ }^{146}$. Similarly, prolonged oestrogen deprivation, which mimicked AI treatment, expanded the subpopulation of ER${}^{-}$ progesterone receptor (PR)${}^{-}$ cytokeratin 5 (CK5)${}^{+}$ luminal basal-like and claudin-low subtype signatures in an ER${}^{+}$PR${}^{+}$ luminal breast cancer xenograft ${ }^{147}$. These cells were sensitive to Notch inhibition with $\gamma$-secretase inhibitors ${ }^{147}$.

### Heterotypic cellular interactions

In addition to cancer cell-autonomous factors, the host microenvironment, including the extracellular matrix (ECM) and various stromal and immune cells, can contribute to drug resistance ${ }^{148}$ (FIG. 7). These are complex interactions to dissect and can be considered on the basis of each cell type that is potentially involved ${ }^{148}$.

#### Cancer-associated fibroblasts

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) express high levels of $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin ($\alpha$SMA), which is a marker of myofibroblasts, and they secrete a number of soluble factors that promote tumour growth and angiogenesis, including transforming growth factor-$\beta$ (TGF$\beta$), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF1; also known as CXCL12) ${ }^{149-151}$. CAF-secreted HGF was associated with fulvestrant resistance *in vitro* owing to activation of MET (the HGF receptor) ${ }^{152}$, whereas SDF1 caused ER${}^{+}$ breast cancers to become resistant to fulvestrant through binding to CXCR4 and subsequent activation of ERK1, ERK2 and p38 MAPK ${ }^{153}$. In addition, CAF-derived TGF$\beta$ induced epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) of ER${}^{+}$ breast cancer cells ${ }^{148}$, a phenotype that was shown to drive resistance to tamoxifen ${ }^{154}$. Additionally, endocrine-resistant ER${}^{+}$ breast cancer cells are reported to gain a more basal phenotype, which is associated with a reduction in E-cadherin expression ${ }^{155}$, as well as enhanced motility and invasion, through the upregulation of SRC kinase, NF-$\kappa$B, CD4, TGF$\beta$ and receptor tyrosine kinase ligands that trigger changes in gene expression via complex signalling networks ${ }^{156,157}$.

REVIEW

shown to promote oestrogen-independent growth of ER+ breast cancer in mouse xenograft models<sup>160</sup>. The protective effect of MSCs on cancer cells is thought to be mediated both by direct cell–cell interaction and by secreted proteins that include HGF, TGFβ, SDF1, hyaluronan, interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8, CCL5 and CCL10 (REF. 148).

Inflammatory and immune cells. Another aspect of tumour stromal biology is the chronic inflammation that is often present in breast cancer. In the setting of persistent chronic inflammation, dynamic interactions between the host and breast cancer cells can promote disease progression and metastasis<sup>161</sup>. In preclinical breast cancer models, IL-4-expressing CD4+ T cells indirectly promote invasion and metastasis by regulating tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs)<sup>162</sup>. These TAMs are capable of enhancing metastasis through the activation of EGFR signalling. In addition, TAMs stimulate breast cancer metastasis by activating NF-κB<sup>163</sup>. Furthermore, intratumoural inflammation results in high levels of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and an inhibitory environment for dendritic cell (DC) and T cell function. PGE2 can induce FOXP3 expression in T regulatory (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells within the tumour microenvironment, thereby altering the phenotype of incoming effector T cells to that of T<sub>Reg</sub> cells that suppress intra-tumoural immune responses<sup>164</sup>. Consistent with a role in inducing an immune-suppressive effect, tumour infiltration by T<sub>Reg</sub> cells has been associated with an increased risk of relapse in patients with ER+ breast cancer<sup>165</sup>. In addition, in the neoadjuvant setting, treatment with letrozole has been shown to reduce intratumoural FOXP3+ T<sub>Reg</sub> cells, with a greater decrease in FOXP3+ T cells observed in responding patients after 6 months of neoadjuvant letrozole therapy<sup>166</sup>

In clinical studies, the presence of tumour-infiltrating T lymphocytes (TILs) and mature DCs correlates with lymph node involvement and tumour grade, and the presence of plasmacytoid DCs in primary breast tumours has been correlated with an adverse outcome, suggesting their contribution to the progression of the disease and possibly to endocrine therapy resistance<sup>167</sup>. Furthermore, in an analysis of gene expression data from 81 paired tumour samples taken at baseline and after 2 weeks of treatment with neoadjuvant anastrozole, higher expression of immune-associated genes such as SLAM family member 8 (SLAMF8) and tumour necrosis factor (TNF), as well as lymphocytic infiltration by histological examination, was associated with poor response<sup>168</sup>. Further analysis of the gene expression data identified the profile most closely aligned to that of DCs<sup>169</sup>, which have been associated with an adverse outcome in AI-treated patients<sup>168</sup>. These data suggest a possible avenue for immunotherapy to overcome endocrine resistance. Studies are ongoing to evaluate vaccines that target HER2 or carbohydrate antigens such as mucin 1 (MUC1), as well as immune checkpoint modulators such as those antagonizing cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death protein 1 (PD1; also known as PDCD1)<sup>170</sup>.

Figure 7 | The tumour microenvironment and AI resistance. The extracellular matrix molecules fibronectin and laminin 5 activate cancer cell growth and survival signalling via integrin receptors. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) secrete a number of soluble factors that promote tumour growth and angiogenesis, including transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ), which promotes epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA), which promotes angiogenesis, and factors that activate epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), MET and CXCR chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4), leading to activation of PI3K–AKT and MAPK pathways and endocrine resistance. In addition, hypoxia-induced lactate and ketone in the tumour microenvironment upregulates TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR) to inhibit apoptosis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) protect cancer cells through direct cell–cell interaction and by secreted proteins. In addition, tumour-associated macrophages (TAMs) and immune cells contribute to local inflammation and immune suppression. There is emerging evidence implicating the contribution of these tumour cell-protective mechanisms from the tumour microenvironment in aromatase inhibitor (AI) resistance.

Mesenchymal stem cells. These pluripotent stem cells are capable of differentiating into connective tissue, osteoblasts, adipocytes and chondrocytes. Although mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) predominantly reside in the bone marrow, they are found in many other tissues and cancers, including breast cancer, and they promote breast cancer metastasis<sup>159</sup>.

growth could be due to cancer cell-intrinsic mechanisms such as the acquisition of resistance mutations; however, the cell biological mechanisms that are responsible for the loss of tumour dormancy and cancer reactivation are poorly understood. Evidence suggests that the bone marrow is a potential sanctuary site where cancer cells reside in the haematopoietic stem cell niche, protected from treatment by the biologically active molecules that are produced there<sup>173</sup>. It has long been recognized that disseminated tumour cells (DTCs) are present in the bone marrow in 30% of patients with localized or early-stage breast cancer<sup>174</sup>, and these patients are at a higher risk of both skeletal and extraskeletal metastasis<sup>175</sup>. These DTCs can persist in the bone marrow for years in a quiescent state and are resistant to cancer therapies<sup>176</sup>. Some DTCs have CSC features with high expression of SNAIL, a transcription factor involved in EMT induction<sup>177</sup>. Interventions that alter bone physiology, such as bisphosphonates, clearly have the potential to favourably alter the natural history of DTCs in the bone marrow, at least in postmenopausal women<sup>178</sup>.

## Conclusions

The FDA approvals for the delay in tumour progression achieved by everolimus and the CDK4 and CDK6 inhibitor palbociclib in combination with an AI promote optimism that considerable improvements in the treatment of AI therapy-resistant ER+ breast cancer are a near-term possibility. However, there is currently no evidence to date that these dual-targeting approaches improve overall survival or are active adjuvant treatments. Improvements in the fidelity of preclinical models are therefore essential, and PDX models clearly have a role in moving the endocrine resistance field beyond the restricted discovery space afforded by the few ER+ cell lines available<sup>31</sup>. However, the value of PDX models for the study of tumour dormancy, stem cell-like behaviour and stromal–epithelial interactions is unclear. Nonetheless, PDX studies, paired with data from the omics analysis of clinical samples, should instruct the design of trials of more effective multi-agent combinations, individually tailored to resistance mechanisms diagnosed through sequencing or other omics techniques (FIG. 8).
