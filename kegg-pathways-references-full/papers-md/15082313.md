Developmental and physiological cues, as well as signals in response to cell damage, initiate a cell suicide program that is often referred to as apoptosis or programmed cell death (PCD). PCD is mediated by the core cell-death machinery consisting of proteins that mediate and control the activation of caspases—enzymes that dismantle cellular architecture during apoptosis. Because components of the caspase-activation apparatus are constitutively present in most cells, most studies during the last decade have focused on the posttranslational regulation of this preexisting machinery. However, accumulating evidence suggests that, in many contexts, transcriptional regulation also plays a crucial role in the activation of the physiological cell-death program.

Programmed cell death (PCD) is an essential process required to delete harmful or superfluous cells and maintain homeostasis [1]. The process of PCD is executed by caspases, cysteine proteases that cleave several hundred proteins in dying cells [2]. The evolutionarily conserved protein-signaling network that causes caspase activation and its regulation is termed the core cell-death machinery. The prototypic apoptotic machinery was first defined in the nematode *Caenorhabditis elegans*, where it consists of four main proteins [3]. Three of these, EGL-1, CED-3 and CED-4, are required for PCD execution, whereas the fourth, CED-9, is essential for cell survival by preventing CED-4-dependent activation of the caspase CED-3 [3]. All these proteins are conserved in mammals, and the homologs CED-3, CED-4 and CED-9 have also been identified in *Drosophila melanogaster* (Figure 1). The mammalian homologs of CED-9 include both death antagonists (e.g. Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Bcl-w) and death agonists (e.g. Bax, Bak and Bok) [2,3]. EGL-1 is similar to proteins that contain a single Bcl-2 homology (BH) domain, BH3 [2–5]. These proteins (e.g. Bid, Bim, Noxa, Puma and Bmf) are commonly known as the BH3-only proteins [4]. Caspases are CED-3 homologs and have 13 members in mammals [2,3]. The only CED-4-like protein identified in mammals is Apaf-1, which is required for caspase-9 activation [6]. In addition to the four conserved proteins that are involved in most stress-mediated apoptotic pathways, mammals also have caspase-activation machinery initiated either by the ligation of death receptors or at the level of endoplasmic reticulum [2,7]. Although the initial activation of caspases can occur in several cellular compartments, there is substantial crosstalk between various

pathways. The inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family of proteins keep caspases in check, whereas several proteins, such as Smac and Diablo in mammals and Reaper (Rpr), Hid and Grim in *Drosophila*, antagonize the functions of IAPs, thus promoting caspase activation [2,3,8]. Although much of the control of caspase activation is mediated by the preexisting cellular machinery, transcription also plays a substantial role in this process. This article focuses on what is currently known about this emerging concept of transcriptional control of the cell-death machinery.

### Activation of caspases

Caspase activation is fundamental to the execution of apoptosis [2,3]. The initial activation of caspases requires the recruitment of the upstream caspases, such as caspase-8 and -9, to specific death complexes through adaptors such as FADD (Fas-associated death domain-containing protein) and Apaf-1 [2,3]. Similarly, the initiator caspases in *C. elegans* (CED-3) and *Drosophila* (DRONC) bind to their adaptors CED-4 and DARK, respectively [2,3,9]. The homophilic interactions between initiator caspases and their respective adaptors are mediated by the protein–protein interaction motifs found in caspases and adaptors. In the death-receptor pathways that are mediated by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of cell surface receptors, ligation of the receptors leads to the recruitment of FADD through death domains [3,7]. FADD, in turn, recruits caspase-8 through death-effector domains (DEDs), forming the death-inducing signaling complex (Figure 1). The stress-induced death pathway involves the recruitment of caspase-9 to an Apaf-1 apoptosome (a caspase-activating complex) through caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), although, in some cell types, apoptosis can occur in the absence of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 [10]. In both cases, the recruitment of initiator caspases results in their activation by a proximity-induced dimerization mechanism [11,12]. Once active, caspase-8 and -9 activate downstream effector caspases that lack DEDs or CARDs (e.g. caspase-3 and -7) by processing the effector caspase precursors into two subunits that form a tetrameric enzyme. Activated effector caspases then mediate the cleavage of over 300 substrates to cause the characteristic changes that occur in apoptotic cells [13].

### Regulation of apoptotic initiation

Activation of the cell-death machinery can occur in many ways. For example, removal or sequestration of antiapoptotic molecules, upregulation or activation of proapoptotic

Figure 1. Conserved components of the cell-death machinery. The Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila and mammalian proteins that constitute the core caspase activation and regulation arm of the apoptotic pathways are illustrated. Analogous colors represent homologs. For Drosophila and mammals, only the representative examples of the family members are shown. In Drosophila and mammals, the two main pathways of caspase activation are induced by cellular stress or damage and the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) family of receptors (TNFRs), also called the death receptors. Although, in C. elegans, CED-9 directly binds to CED-4 to prevent CED-3 activation, there is no evidence for Bcl-2 family members directly interacting with the CED-4 homologs in Drosophila and in mammals. Nevertheless, in Drosophila and mammals, Bcl-2 homologs act upstream of caspase activation. Until now, an EGL-1 homolog (BH3-only protein) has not been reported in Drosophila. The death-receptor pathway in Drosophila consists of a TNF-like molecule (Eiger) and its receptor (Wengen). Induction of apoptosis by this pathway depends on the activation of the JNK pathway, DARK and DRONC [74]. In mammals, the TNFR-mediated cell death proceeds through a distinct adaptor (FADD) and caspase (caspase-8) complex. Many of the components of cell-death machinery shown here are regulated at the level of transcription.

molecules or translocation of a proapoptotic molecule to a specific cellular compartment can all result in caspase activation. Thus, although most cells constitutively contain both prosurvival and proapoptotic components of the core cell-death machinery, an alteration in the balance between pro and antideath factors is crucial in the regulation of apoptosis. Various signals, such as cytotoxic insults, hormones and growth factors, regulate the activation of the death program by controlling the balance between pro and antideath factors. Recent evidence suggests that BH3-only proteins play a key role in the activation of cell-death machinery by interfering with the prosurvival Bcl-2 family members [2,4]. The members of the BH3-only proteins can be regulated by different means such as sequestration to the cytoskeleton, posttranslational modification by phosphorylation or cleavage and transcriptional upregulation [4]. However, besides these proteins, much less is known about the transcriptional regulation of other factors that control PCD in various ways. Although rapid activation of a preexisting cell-death machinery is important for the removal of a cell damaged by cytotoxic insults, the coordinated removal of specific cells in a tissue, or synchronous removal of a large number of cells during development, metamorphosis or tissue remodeling, is also regulated at the level of transcription of the key components of the cell-death machinery. Emerging data, some summarized here, suggest that regulation of the expression of genes involved in the cell-death 'execution' machinery plays a direct role in various cell survival and apoptotic signaling pathways. Figure 2 shows various

cell-survival and -death genes that are transcriptionally regulated in response to different signaling pathways.

Transcriptional regulation of developmental PCD Most knowledge of transcriptional control of developmental cell death is derived from nonmammalian models such as C. elegans and Drosophila. The BH3-only proteins, which link apoptotic signaling to the execution machinery, are often transcriptionally controlled. One example is the apoptosis of neurosecretory motor neurons (NSM) 'sister' cells in C. elegans. During embryogenesis, the NSM cells differentiate into neurons, whereas their sister cells undergo EGL-1-dependent PCD [14]. Mutation of the genes encoding CES-1, a snail family of zinc-finger transcription factors, and CES-2, a βZIP transcription factor, interferes with the death of the NSM sister cells [15]. The egl-1 promoter contains a snail binding-site, which overlaps with the binding site of the βHLH transcription factors HLH-2 and 3. These factors transcriptionally activate egl-1, whereas CES-1 competes for the binding site of egl-1, repressing transcription and promoting survival [15]. In the ventral cord PAG-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor, similar to CES-1, determines neuroblast fate in C. elegans by regulating differentiation and PCD [16]. Interestingly, the mammalian homolog of PAG-3, Gfi1, controls cell survival by directly repressing transcription of the proapoptotic Bcl-2 family member Bax in cultured lymphocytes [17].

In Drosophila, the apoptotic activators Rpr and Hid are transcriptionally controlled to orchestrate temporal and spatial PCD during development. These proteins act by

Figure 2. Transcriptional control of cell-death genes occurs in various different pathways. Some examples of cell-survival and -death pathways that are regulated at the level of transcription are shown. These pathways use different groups of transcription factors to regulate apoptotic (red) or antiapoptotic (green) genes, altering the balance between death versus survival signalling. Many hormones and cytokines primarily act as survival factors and their removal could activate the expression of apoptotic genes and/or repress the genes that are required for keeping the death machinery inactive.

neutralizing Diap1, allowing caspase activation [18]. Diverse apoptotic signals converge on Rpr, Hid and Grim and are relayed to the core cell-death machinery (Figure 3). The survival of a subset of midline glia cells in *Drosophila* depends upon suppression of Hid through the EGF-receptor-RAS-MAPK pathway [19,20]. The Hox gene *deformed (Dfd)*, expressed in the maxillary and mandibular segments, is necessary for the morphological features of the head segments, and *Dfd*-null mutants show abnormalities of the mandibular and maxillary lobes because of an excess of cell populations in these regions [21]. *Dfd* is a direct transcriptional activator of *rpr* gene and Rpr-mediated apoptosis is necessary to maintain the maxillary-mandibular boundary [22]. The Hox family member Abdominal B also induces cell death at the boundaries between abdominal segments through the activation of *rpr* [22]. Abdominal A was recently found to control proliferation of neuroblasts by determining the timing of PCD and therefore the amount of progeny produced by each neuroblast [23].

Hox-dependent regulation of apoptosis seems to be a conserved mechanism during animal development. Although some Hox genes are necessary for PCD, others are required for cell survival. In amniotes, for example, limb formation is accompanied by cell death in the interdigital mesenchymal tissue, eliminating cells located between the differentiating cartilages and thereby ‘sculpting’ the limb shape [24]. In *Hoxa13* heterozygous mice, reduced apoptosis in the interdigital regions leads to the fusion of digits II and III [25]. In addition, DLX-7, a divergent homeobox gene expressed in normal bone marrow, is required for cell survival [26]. Although many Hox genes are implicated in the control of PCD, their relevant targets remain largely unknown.

Figure 3. Transcriptional control of pro- and anti-death factors regulates caspase activation in *Drosophila*. This diagram provides an example of how transcription regulates the balance between apoptotic and antiapoptotic (survival) genes to control caspase activation in *Drosophila* cells. The caspase inhibitor Diap1 is essential for survival of most *Drosophila* cells and its removal is sufficient to induce the activation of the initiator caspase DRONC. Death inducers Rpr and Hid bind to and promote Diap1 degradation that allows DRONC activation through binding to its adaptor DARK. In cells destined to die, Rpr and Hid are upregulated in response to various death signals by transcription factors such as Dfd and Dmp53, whereas in healthy cells, Hid is kept in check. The expression of *dronc* and *dark* is also upregulated in response to specific death signals, presumably to overcome effects of Diap1 inhibition.

(TH) as individual tissues undergo distinct changes at different stages of development [28, 29]. These changes include formation of the limb, tail resorption and drastic remodeling events in the brain and the intestine. The TH target-genes include transcription factors, signaling molecules, caspases and matrix metalloproteases [29]. Although many steroid hormones, including estrogen, androgen and progesteron, are known to regulate cell survival [30], the best-studied models of steroid-regulated PCD are glucocorticoid-mediated thymocyte apoptosis in mammals and ecdysone-mediated PCD during larval-pupal metamorphosis in *Drosophila* [31, 32]. Glucocorticoids repress the activity of prosurvival transcription factors such as NFκB, and AP-1 [31]; however, recent microarray data suggest that *bim* is upregulated by glucocorticoids, thereby linking the effects of glucocorticoids to the activation of the apoptosis effector machinery [33]. The upregulation of *bim* by glucocorticoids is probably indirect and might involve forkhead (FOXO) transcription factor (FKHRL1) [33].

In *Drosophila*, the steroid hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone (commonly known as ecdysone) regulates differentiation, morphogenesis and PCD to remove obsolete larval tissues [1, 34–36]. An increase in ecdysone titer at the end of the third larval instar triggers metamorphosis and the destruction of the larval midgut and anterior muscles. Twelve hours following puparium formation, a second rise in ecdysone triggers salivary glands to undergo PCD [34–36]. Ecdysone binds to its heterodimeric receptor EcR-Usp, directly activating a set of early genes many of which encode transcription factors including Broad-Complex (BR-C), E74A and E93 (Figure 4). Studies involving the salivary gland and *in vitro* PCD models indicate that these transcription factors upregulate key cell-death genes, including *rpr*, *hid*, *dark* and *dronc*, and downregulate death inhibitors *diap1* and *diap2* (Figures 3 and 4) [34–37]. EcR-Usp and ecdysone-induced transcription factors could also play a role in the temporal and spatial regulation of gene expression associated with PCD. For example, BR-C and E93 regulate temporal expression of the caspase *dronc*, whereas direct binding of EcR-Usp to the *dronc* promoter is important for spatial expression of this caspase [36–38]. Numerous other genetic, cellular and biochemical studies have clearly established the fundamental role of hormone-mediated transcription in directly activating the core cell-death machinery [1, 30, 31, 34].

### Transcriptional control of stress-induced apoptosis

Cellular stress, caused by DNA-damaging agents, cytokine withdrawal or UV irradiation, triggers the apoptotic response as a safeguard to remove harmful cells from the organism. Cytokine withdrawal also plays a key role in deleting unwanted cells during embryonic and adult development. Increasing evidence in various model systems indicates that, in many cases, the regulation of stress-induced PCD occurs through transcriptional control of proteins of the core cell-death machinery, especially BH3-only proteins and Bcl-2 family members. The BH3-only protein Bim is required for both cytokine-withdrawal-induced cell death and homeostasis in the

**Figure 4.** An ecdysone-induced hierarchy of genes controls programmed cell death (PCD) in the salivary glands of *Drosophila*. During larval-pupal metamorphosis, a prepupal pulse of ecdysone initiates PCD. The timing of the ecdysone pulse in relation of the prepupal-pupal development is crucial for temporal regulation of PCD. The blue line shows the separation of the prepupal and pupal stages. Ecdysone binds to its heterodimeric receptor consisting of EcR and Usp proteins and promotes the expression of various transcription factors including E74A, BR-C and E93. These factors then upregulate transcription of several genes of the core cell-death machinery. EcR-Usp can also directly activates *rpr* and *dronc* promoters, which probably contributes to temporal and spatial control of gene expression. EcR-Usp represses the nuclear receptor βFTZ-F1, which acts as a competence factor to facilitate the expression of ecdysone-induced transcription factors, presumably to provide temporal control of ecdysone action.

immune and haemopoietic compartments [39, 40]. In pro B and T cells, deprivation of the survival cytokine IL-3 results in the dephosphorylation of FKHRL1, which translocates to the nucleus and activates *Bim* expression [41]. IL-2-mediated T-cell survival pathway involves the activation of serine/threonine kinase PKB and/or Akt, which inhibits transcriptional activation of FOXO3 [42]. IL-2 withdrawal results in rapid dephosphorylation of FOXO3 and upregulation of *Bim*, suggesting that IL-2-mediated T-cell survival occurs through FOXO3 inactivation and hence the suppression of *Bim* expression. GM-CSF and IL-3 are key survival cytokines for haemopoietic cells and their effects are mediated by the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PtdIns 3-kinase) pathway [43]. Mcl-1, a member of Bcl-2 family, is induced early in many myeloid leukemia cells and its overexpression delays apoptosis induced by the withdrawal of growth factor [44]. In IL-3-stimulated cells, the transcription factor CREB binds to a CRE-2-binding site in the *Mcl-1* promoter and mediates *Mcl-1* expression [45].

Recent findings suggest that *Bim* regulation is also crucial for neuronal survival and apoptosis [46–49]. For example, in sympathetic neurons, the survival of which depends on nerve growth factor (NGF), NGF withdrawal results in upregulation of *Bim* through FKHRL1 [48]. The insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) exerts its neuroprotective effects through the PtdIns 3-kinase pathway [49]. Interestingly, when NGF is withdrawn IGF-1 completely blocks FKHRL1 dephosphorylation and *Bim*

transcriptional upregulation in neurons [49], emphasizing that cell-death signals converge on FOXO activation of Bim. In PC12 cells, the withdrawal of NGF upregulates antiapoptotic isoform of Bcl-x (Bcl-xs) and Bax [50]; however, how these proteins are regulated at the levels of transcription is unknown.

DNA-damage-induced apoptosis involves two main transcription factors, p53 and E2F-1, which have been implicated in various apoptotic pathways and play a crucial role in cancer development [51]. These transcription factors control the expression of several cell-death and -survival genes (Figure 5). In *Drosophila* embryos, UV induces expression of *dark* and *rpr* (Figure 3) [52,53]. An E2F-binding site in the *dark* promoter appears to regulate its UV-induced transcription [52]. In addition, the binding of p53 directly regulates *rpr* promoter [53]. Similar to *Drosophila dark*, E2F-1 can directly bind to and regulate *Apaf-1* promoter in mammals [54]. In neurons, p53 also directly induces Apaf-1 [55]. Although E2F-1 partly mediates apoptosis through p53, in cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can induce apoptosis through the transcription of p73, a member of p53 family that shares some of its targets with p53 [56]. Retinoblastoma (Rb) restrains proliferation partly by suppressing E2F-1-mediated transcription [57]. In quiescent cells, Rb interacts with E2F-1, and as cells progress into the cell cycle, phosphorylation of Rb by cyclin-dependent kinases frees E2F-1, allowing it to activate genes required for the entry into the S phase [57]. Consequently, loss of Rb or enforced E2F expression can result in apoptosis. Recent data show that, indeed, deregulation of E2F-1 by adenovirus E1A, loss of Rb or forced E2F-1 expression results in direct transcriptional upregulation of several caspases [58]. Transcriptional repression by E2F-1 is also equally important for initiating apoptosis as seen with Mcl-1, which is repressed in response to E2F-1 expression [59]. Although Rb represses E2F-1, it can also act as an activator of transcription in some cell types. In epithelial cells, for example, inactivation of Rb by the large T antigen of SV40 induces

massive apoptosis [60]. This could simply be because of either increased caspase expression by E2F-1 or Bcl-2 downregulation in the absence of Rb, because Rb regulates Bcl-2 through the epithelial transcription factor AP-2 [61].

The BH3-only proteins Noxa and PUMA are directly regulated by p53, and according to recent knockout data, are both important for p53-mediated cell death [62–66]. PUMA loss causes a partial resistance to apoptosis induced by cytokine withdrawal, PMA and glucocorticoids [64,65]. PUMA can also be induced by signals that mediate p53-independent cell death, and antiapoptotic growth factors, such as IGF-1 or epidermal growth factor, strongly inhibit PUMA expression [67]. Dexamethasone and serum deprivation potently upregulate PUMA [67]; however, the transcription factors involved in these responses have not been identified.

Transcriptional regulation of death receptor pathways

Apoptosis induced by TNF family of death receptors (TNFRs) proceeds through the recruitment of the FADD adaptor and caspase-8 to the activated receptor complex (Figure 1) [7,68]. Several components of the death receptor pathways are also regulated by transcription to control apoptosis. One of these regulators is FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP), a caspase-8-like protein that lacks catalytic activity [69]. PKB promotes FLIP expression and cell survival in endothelial and tumor cells through FOXO3a [70]. NFκB also regulates FLIP expression during B-cell survival [71]. An additional target for NFκB is A1, which is a member of Bcl-2 family [72]. The TNF family member Fas-ligand–CD95L acts through its receptor Fas–CD95 to induce apoptosis in many cell types [68]. In the immune system, CD95L–CD95-mediated apoptosis is crucial for homeostasis. Several signaling pathways regulate CD95L expression. These include: antigen stimulation of T cells by crosslinking of TCR and/or CD3, engagement of CD28 on the T cells by the B7 family of receptors expressed on the antigen-presenting cells, cytotoxic drug-induced stress and IFN-γ-receptor-mediated signaling involving

Figure 5. Regulation of the core cell-death machinery by E2F-1 and the p53 family. E2F-1 can regulate apoptosis in many ways. It can induce cell death by stabilizing the levels of p53 through activating the ARF tumor suppressor, which suppresses Mdm2, a negative regulator of p53. The p53 protein regulates the transcription of several cell-death genes including BH3-only proteins, proapoptotic Bcl-2 protein Bax and the caspase-9 adaptor Apaf-1. In cells lacking p53, E2F-1 can act through p73, a member of p53 family that activates some of the same target genes as p53. E2F-1 can also directly regulate the transcription of several different caspases and suppress cell survival pathways by suppressing Mcl-1 expression or by inhibiting NFκB-mediated antiapoptotic signaling.

phosphorylation of STAT1 through the activation of the JAK1 and JAK2 [68]. The promoter of the gene encoding CD95L is highly complex and is directly or indirectly regulated by a large number of transcription factors, such as NF-AT, Egr, NFkB, HIV-1 Tat, AP-1, cMyc, Nur77, IFN-regulatory factors (IRFs), viral IRFs, SP-1, ALG-4 and CIITA [68]. Caspase-8, which is the initiator caspase for all TNFR-mediated death pathways, is also transcriptionally induced in some cases and its promoter contains a p53-responsive element [73].

### Concluding remarks – future perspectives

This article summarizes some recent developments in the field of transcriptional regulation of apoptotic genes in response to specific death signals. Despite the intense effort to identify and study the basic cell-death machinery in the past decade, little attention has been paid to the fact that varying concentrations of the core components of the death machinery can mediate apoptosis. The emerging concept that, the survival–death switch is turned on or off by transcription factors through either upregulating proapoptotic genes or downregulating antiapoptotic genes, is well established in various contexts of PCD, including cytotoxic stress, nuclear hormones, death ligands and developmental cues. Importantly, studies from nonmammalian systems indicate that the temporal and spatial regulation of PCD during development is primarily regulated by controlling the expression of cell-death execution machinery, and many transcription factors that regulate PCD are also involved in other pathways. One key question that is to be addressed is whether temporal and spatial control of PCD during mammalian development is also orchestrated at the transcriptional level. For instance, temporally and spatially controlled upregulation of specific BH3-only proteins might play a key role in deleting specific cells or tissues during tissue and organ modelling, and this might, in turn, be regulated by specific hormones, cytokines and retinoids. The scene is now set for more detailed mechanistic studies to understand and exploit the transcriptional machinery involved in various PCD pathways. As aberrant expression of cell death and survival regulators can result in human pathologies, the transcription factors that specifically control apoptotic execution machinery are potentially novel targets for therapeutic intervention.
