Protein aggregation and neurodegenerative disease

Christopher A Ross & Michelle A Poirier

Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD), Parkinson’s disease (PD), Huntington’s disease (HD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and prion diseases are increasingly being realized to have common cellular and molecular mechanisms including protein aggregation and inclusion body formation. The aggregates usually consist of fibers containing misfolded protein with a β-sheet conformation, termed amyloid. There is partial but not perfect overlap among the cells in which abnormal proteins are deposited and the cells that degenerate. The most likely explanation is that inclusions and other visible protein aggregates represent an end stage of a molecular cascade of several steps, and that earlier steps in the cascade may be more directly tied to pathogenesis than the inclusions themselves. For several diseases, genetic variants assist in explaining the pathogenesis of the more common sporadic forms and developing mouse and other models. There is now increased understanding of the pathways involved in protein aggregation, and some recent clues have emerged as to the molecular mechanisms of cellular toxicity. These are leading to approaches toward rational therapeutics.

### Neurodegenerative diseases and pathology

All of the diseases discussed here involve selective neuronal vulnerability with degeneration in specific brain regions, and deposits of abnormal proteins in neurons and other cells or extracellularly [1–9] (see Table 1 and Figure 1). This review will consider mechanisms of protein misfolding and aggregation in relation to disease pathogenesis, along with therapeutic implications.

#### Huntington’s disease

HD is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a CAG repeat coding for polyglutamine in the N terminus of the huntingtin protein. Because it is caused by a mutation in a single gene, HD has emerged as a model for studying neurodegenerative disease pathogenesis. There is a remarkable threshold effect, in that polyglutamine stretches of ≥36 in huntingtin cause disease, whereas ≤35 do not. Within the expanded range, longer repeats cause earlier onset. There is a striking correlation between the threshold for aggregation *in vitro* and the threshold for disease in humans, consistent with the idea that aggregation is related to pathogenesis [10,11]. Inclusions containing huntingtin are present in regions of the brain that degenerate. However, the neurons with inclusions do not correspond exactly to the neurons that degenerate. For instance, inclusions are present in the striatum, which is most affected [12], but they are more enriched in populations of large interneurons, which are spared, than in medium spiny projection neurons, which are selectively lost [13]. There is a good correlation, however, between the length of the CAG repeat and the density of inclusions [12–16].

Huntingtin aggregates can be labeled with antibodies to the N terminus of huntingtin or antibodies to ubiquitin, a marker for misfolded proteins, and a signal for degradation by the proteasome. Proteasomes may have difficulty digesting them, however, leading to their accumulation [17]. The aggregates contain fibers and appear to have β-sheet structure characteristic of amyloid [10], although there is controversy about whether they bind dyes that intercalate into β-sheets, as is a characteristic of amyloid. Other proteins, such as Creb binding protein (CBP; discussed later) containing polyglutamine may be recruited into huntingtin aggregates [18,19].

#### Other polyglutamine diseases

Other polyglutamine diseases, including dentato-rubral and pallido-luysian atrophy (DRPLA) and several forms of spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA), also have intranuclear inclusions in regions roughly corresponding to the regions of neuronal degeneration [20,21]. Analysis of the mutations present in individuals with SCA1 and of unaffected individuals supports the relevance of protein aggregation to degeneration. Some individuals have been found with histidine interruptions in an expanded polyglutamine repeat in ataxin-1, the SCA1 gene product. These histidine interruptions result in the absence of the disease and strikingly less propensity to aggregation [22].

#### Alzheimer’s disease and tauopathies

AD is a late-onset dementing illness, with progressive loss of memory, task performance, speech, and recognition of people and objects. There is degeneration of neurons (particularly in the basal forebrain and hippocampus), but at least as important for pathogenesis may be synaptic pathology and altered neu-

disease is a prototypical protein conformation disease, in that highly sophisticated studies have shown that it is caused by abnormal protein structure and not an infective viral agent. Mechanisms of prion disease have been illuminated by the discovery of prionlike protein conformational changes in yeast^{37,38}. In all cases, disease is caused by abnormally folded prion proteins. Prion aggregation can take place both extracellularly and intracellularly^{39,40}.

### Commonalities of amyloid structure

Amyloid fibrils are filamentous structures with a width of ~10 nm and a length of 0.1–10 μm. A defining feature, originally revealed by X-RAY FIBER DIFFRACTION analysis^{41,42}, is the presence of cross-β structure. In this structural motif, ribbonlike β-sheets are formed by β-strands running nearly perpendicular to the long axis of the fibril and hydrogen bonds that run nearly parallel to the long axis.

The most extensively characterized amyloid fibril is that formed from the β-amyloid (Aβ) peptide implicated in AD. Using SOLID-STATE NUCLEAR MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY, the in-register, parallel β-sheet organization of fibrils formed by Aβ_{10–35}, a fragment of the full-length 42-residue Aβ peptide, was first described^{43}. It was subsequently found that full-length Aβ_{1–42} forms β-sheets with the same registry and orientation^{44}. Using ELECTRON PARAMAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY, a similar structural model was obtained for Aβ peptide and Aβ_{40} (ref. 45).

A similar analysis of fibrils formed by α-synuclein found an in-register, parallel β-sheet organization^{46}. The core structure of Aβ, α-synuclein and polyglutamine aggregates appears to involve both β-strands and β-turns^{47–50}. Recent data suggest that the structure of polyglutamine aggregates may involve a compact β-sheet with interspersed β-turns every nine glutamines^{50–52}. Thus a β-sheet plus β-turn structure may be a common form of neurodegenerative disease-related amyloid (see Fig. 2)

Consistent with a common structure, conformation-specific antibodies can bind to the amyloid fibril state of the Aβ peptide but not to its soluble monomeric state. They also bind to amyloid fibrils and amyloid-like aggregates derived from other proteins of unrelated sequence including polyglutamine, but not to non-native globular protein aggregates such as collagen, gelatin or elastin^{53}. Thus, whereas there are still many unknowns regarding the detailed structure of amyloid and particularly regarding its assembly, there seem to be considerable similarities among the structures of different kinds of disease-related amyloid.

#### Initiation of aggregation

Neurodegenerative disease proteins often appear to be natively unfolded^{54}. There may be several kinds of aggregates, including disordered or ‘amorphous’ aggregates, but amyloid fibrils are most characteristic. What might initiate the aggregation process?

The initiation of misfolding in a particular cell may be a stochastic event, with a constant risk over the life of the individual^{55}. Amyloid formation may proceed via a process of ‘seeded polymerization’^{56–59}. The likelihood of aggregation could be increased by increasing protein concentration. This can be caused by genetic dosage alterations. For instance, familial PD can be caused by triplication at the α-synuclein locus^{60}. Early deposition of Aβ plaques occurs in individuals with Down’s syndrome, who carry an extra copy of the APP locus on chromosome 21. Polymorphisms in promoter sites of disease-associated genes may increase transcription and thus protein amounts, increasing the risk for neurodegenerative disease^{61}. In the case of protein-coding mutations, the altered primary structure presumably makes the protein more prone to aggregate. For polyglutamine proteins, there is a very clear correlation between the expansion of the polyglutamine stretch and the aggregation of polyglutamine itself.

Covalent modifications of proteins may facilitate aggregation. Sporadic neurodegenerative diseases are generally associated with aging, which is accompanied by oxidative modifications of proteins. Oxidative modification of α-synuclein via dopamine adducts may facilitate aggregation^{62}. Aging may also decrease the ability of the cell to clear misfolded

containing the expanded polyglutamine repeat are substantially more toxic, in most cell and mouse models, than longer or full-length huntingtin<sup>71–73</sup>. Huntingtin can be cleaved by several proteases, including caspases and calpains<sup>74,75</sup>, and an unidentified aspartyl protease<sup>76</sup>. The N-terminal fragment of huntingtin can undergo a conformational change and form polyglutamine aggregates<sup>77</sup>. Cleavage of atrophin-1, the DRPLA gene product, may be involved in DRPLA pathogenesis<sup>78</sup>. Proteolytic cleavage has also been proposed for other polyglutamine disorders.

A role for proteolytic cleavage in PD pathogenesis is less well established. Lewy bodies contain both N-terminal and C-terminal epitopes of α-synuclein, indicating the presence of full-length protein. There may be also be truncated species, however. Recent observations of a transgenic mouse model of PD suggest the existence of several truncated species of α-synuclein protein, enriched in the insoluble fraction<sup>79</sup>. It is conceivable that these could initiate or facilitate the aggregation process.

### Intermediates in the aggregation process

It is becoming increasingly clear that protein aggregation is a complex process, involving several kinds of intermediates and resulting in different kinds of fibers or amorphous aggregates. Many of the studies to date have been done *in vitro* and may not mimic the situation in human diseases, so there is much to be learned<sup>80,81</sup>.

#### Aβ aggregation intermediates and toxicity

Several soluble oligomeric intermediates (larger than dimers) of Aβ peptide variants have been described independently by several different groups. One researcher proposed that Aβ<sub>42</sub> and the shorter 1–40 fragment form a ‘micelle’ structure in solution<sup>82</sup>. Another group identified spheroidal structures by ATOMIC FORCE MICROSCOPY (AFM) and referred to them as Aβ ‘protofibrils’ (ref. 83). Finally, a third group described a globular intermediate for Aβ<sub>42</sub> and gave it the name ADDL, for Aβ-derived diffusible ligand<sup>84</sup>. For simplicity, all of these species may be termed globular or oligomeric intermediates.

Chainlike fibrils have also been detected by AFM<sup>85,86</sup> and electron microscopy (EM)<sup>87</sup> for Aβ variants. These species, referred to as protofibrils, often have a curvilinear morphology, are 4 nm in height by AFM and range between 6 and 10 nm in diameter by EM. Protofibrils are shorter than mature fibers, with a length range between 5 and 160 nm. Although the pathway of assembly is not certain, it seems that globular intermediates may polymerize further to form protofibrils<sup>88</sup>. The term protofibril may best be reserved for small species with an early fibril-like morphology. Protofibrils then may assemble into protofilaments and finally mature fibers (Fig. 3).

Although neuritic plaques are a hallmark of AD, there is a poor correlation between plaque density in human postmortem material and antemortem cognitive deficits<sup>89</sup>. Soluble Aβ intermediates have been observed in human postmortem material<sup>90,91</sup>. Toxicity *in vitro* has been described for both globular and protofibrillar intermediates.

mediates<sup>84,88</sup>. Injection of purified Aβ monomers and spheroids into rat hippocampus<sup>92</sup> *in vivo* caused a block in long-term potentiation, substantiating a role for Aβ aggregation intermediates in AD neurotoxicity.

Intermediates in α-synuclein aggregation. Several different aggregation intermediates with size and morphology similar to those for Aβ have been described for α-synuclein. The pathway of assembly for intermediate forms of α-synuclein may be complex, with globular and ringlike forms in addition to curvilinear protofibrils<sup>93</sup>. Polyunsaturated fatty acids were reported to promote oligomerization, suggesting that α-synuclein may aggregate via an interaction with cell membranes<sup>94</sup>. One proposed mechanism of toxicity is the formation of pores by ringlike intermediates<sup>93</sup>, although this idea is based on *in vitro* studies with recombinant protein.

Polyglutamine aggregation and toxic mechanisms. Fibers and amorphous aggregates with varying morphologies can be generated *in vitro* for polyglutamine-containing peptides and proteins, suggesting that the pathway of fibrillation may be complex<sup>95</sup>. Recent studies suggest that globular and protofibrillar intermediates form before mature huntingtin fibers, and that these might be crucial for toxicity<sup>77,96</sup>. An alternative possibility might involve toxicity associated with linear addition of monomers to a nascent fibril (ref. 50). Using recombinant mutant huntingtin exon-1 N-terminal fragment, one group of researchers have found that Congo red, an amyloid-binding dye, enriched the population of protofibrils, suggesting that the dye may block the aggregation pathway at an early stage<sup>77</sup>. Congo red administration to transgenic HD mice led to an improvement of the behavioral phenotype and prolonged survival<sup>96</sup>. Taken together, these data are consistent with studies suggesting a role for huntingtin intermediates in aggregate formation and toxicity, although which form might be toxic is unclear.

Polyglutamine toxicity may involve recruitment into nascent polyglutamine aggregates of other proteins containing short polyglutamine stretches. Many proteins in the cell have such regions, including transcription factors and other transcriptional regulators. CBP, a key transcriptional co-activator important for the survival of many neurons, can form aberrant interactions with huntingtin *in vitro*<sup>97</sup>. One potential mechanism of toxicity is that a structural change in CBP, induced by its interaction with mutant huntingtin, leads to its degradation of CBP by the proteasome<sup>98</sup>.

A different mechanism of polyglutamine toxicity proposed by another team of researchers is through interference with the proteasome. They have shown that mutant huntingtin can inhibit the proteasome, presumably by becoming engaged with it but not cleaved<sup>99</sup>. In these studies, cells with visible aggregates were positive for proteasome inhibition, although one cannot rule out that microaggregates not visible by microscopy were responsible for cell toxicity.

Commonalities among soluble oligomeric intermediate species. As described earlier, aggregation intermediates have been widely observed in many of the neurodegenerative diseases. Recently, an antibody has been generated that reacts with oligomeric, but not with monomeric or fibrillar forms of polyglutamine, Aβ, α-synuclein and prion protein<sup>100</sup>. This antibody recognized material in postmortem AD brain tissue that was distinct from plaques, and that blocked cell toxicity by Aβ, α-synuclein and polyglutamine. The actual mechanism for this block in toxicity is uncertain, because polyglutamine and α-synuclein interact intracellularly whereas Aβ interacts extracellularly. Nevertheless, it is tempting to speculate that a common structure of soluble nonfibrillar intermediates exists for all of these molecules, and that there may be common mechanisms of pathogenesis.

**Therapeutic strategies**

The cell has developed mechanisms to defend against misfolded and aggregated proteins. The first line of defense involves the many molecular chaperones that aid in normal folding and also in refolding of

Figure 3 Flowchart for therapeutic intervention in a hypothetical several-step pathway of protein aggregation. An initiating event in aggregation may be covalent modification of the disease protein, for example by cleavage or phosphorylation, facilitating conversion of the protein to an abnormal conformation. Oligomeric (globular) intermediates may form, and then protofibrillar structures are assembled. Amyloid fibers can then form, possibly through association of protofibrillar intermediates, resulting in aggregates or inclusions visible in the light microscope. The intermediate species are hypothesized to be more toxic than either the precursor protein or the aggresomes and inclusions. Inhibition early in the pathway would be beneficial to the cell, because it may prevent the formation of potentially toxic oligomeric or other intermediates. (In a model with linear addition and no oligomeric intermediates, the process of polymerization itself would be presumed to be toxic.) By contrast, inhibition at later stages could be detrimental, because it may result in accumulation of toxic intermediates. If inhibitors could be developed that would act at the intermediate steps, they could help identify which intermediate is the toxic species. This model is based on a very hypothetical pathway for polyglutamine aggregation<sup>51,57</sup>, and the details are subject to change; however, the concept may be generally applicable.

GLOSSARY

**β-sheets** A type of repetitive secondary structure that is commonly found in folded proteins. β-Sheets are formed of alternating pleated strands linked by hydrogen bonding between the amino and carboxyl groups of the peptide bond. Formation of β-sheets can be stabilized by protein oligomerization or aggregation.

**X-ray fiber diffraction** Technique that involves the use of X-rays to determine the quasi-atomic structure of a protein fiber. Although the wavelength of X-rays is close to the size of atoms, images are not reconstructed directly from the scattered X-rays, but from diffraction patterns. Diffraction results from the constructive and destructive interference of X-rays as they are reflected off electrons.

**Solid-state NMR spectroscopy** Structural method that depends on obtaining a measure of the magnetic moment of atomic nuclei, which is obtained applying an external magnetic field to a substance of interest in a constant radio frequency field. By contrast to solution-state NMR, solid-state NMR is performed on material in the solid state.

**Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy** When an atom with an unpaired electron is placed in a magnetic field, the spin of the unpaired electron can align, either in the same direction as the field or in the opposite direction. Electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy is used to measure the absorption of microwave radiation that accompanies the transition between these two states.

**Atomic force microscopy** A form of microscopy in which a probe is mechanically tracked over a surface of interest in a series of x-y scans. The force found at each coordinate is measured with piezoelectric sensors, providing information about the chemical nature of a surface.

**Autophagy** Vacuolation of a portion of the cell’s own cytoplasm within a membrane and its subsequent digestion after fusion with a lysosome.

Other therapeutic interventions might directly reduce the level of abnormal protein within the cell, for instance using RNA interference<sup>111</sup>, although its delivery would have to overcome formidable barriers of entry across the blood-brain barrier and access to neurons in the relevant region of the brain. For a disease such as PD (because the substantia nigra is relatively small), viral vectors could be directly injected. In patients with the dominant familial diseases, such as PD, ALS and AD, in which there are point mutations, it may be feasible to inactivate the mutant allele selectively<sup>112</sup>. Another approach, at least for diseases involving extracellular aggregates, is to use antibodies. Immunization approaches to Aβ have been tried with considerable success in animal models, but with side effects including encephalitis in humans<sup>113–115</sup>.

Small molecules, which could be developed as drugs, may be able to target the protein misfolding pathway. Congo red binds to proteins with β-sheet structure and may alter the protein misfolding pathway<sup>77,80</sup> and reduce toxicity *in vivo*<sup>96</sup>. Chemical chaperones may be developed for blocking protein aggregation. The disaccharide trehalose<sup>116</sup> has recently had some success for polyglutamine disease, although at high concentration.

Small-molecule agents are being developed to inhibit aggregation of Aβ<sup>117–119</sup>, α-synuclein<sup>79</sup> and prions<sup>120,121</sup>. Small molecules can inhibit polyglutamine aggregation *in vitro*<sup>122,123</sup>. This has led to the development of an automated small-molecule screen for *in vitro* inhibitors of polyglutamine aggregation.

One potential danger with inhibiting one step in a several-step aggregation pathway is that accumulation of a toxic intermediate could make toxicity worse (see Fig. 3). Nevertheless, even if all compounds do not have beneficial effects, they may prove to be powerful probes for understanding of the protein misfolding pathway. These approaches could, in principle, be applied to all the diseases. Thus, a great hope in this area is that the development of understanding and therapy for one of the diseases may have implications for the others.

Another approach involves identifying specific pathogenic mechanisms for individual diseases and developing targeted therapy. Proteolytic cleavage is an especially attractive therapeutic target, because proteolytic enzymes may be amenable to the development of high-potency small-molecule inhibitors. This is a major strategy for AD, targeting both γ-secretase and β-secretase<sup>27,124</sup>. There is great hope that better understanding of the pathogenic pathways will lead to rational therapeutics.
