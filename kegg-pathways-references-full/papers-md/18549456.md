### Summary

*Legionella pneumophila enhC⁻* mutants were originally identified as being defective for uptake into host cells. In this work, we found that the absence of EnhC resulted in defective intracellular growth when dissemination of intracellular bacteria to neighbouring cells was expected to occur. No such defect was observed during growth within the amoeba *Dictyostelium discoideum*. Culture supernatants containing the secreted products of infected macrophages restricted the growth of the ΔenhC strain, while tumour necrosis factor α (TNF-α), at concentrations similar to those found in macrophage culture supernatants, could reproduce the growth restriction exerted by culture supernatants on *L. pneumophila ΔenhC*. The absence of EnhC also caused defective trafficking of the *Legionella*-containing vacuole in TNF-α-treated macrophages. EnhC was shown to be an envelope-associated protein largely localized to the periplasm, with its expression induced in post-exponential phase, as is true for many virulence-associated proteins. Furthermore, the absence of EnhC appeared to affect survival under stress conditions, as the ΔenhC mutant was more susceptible to H₂O₂ treatment than the wild-type strain. EnhC therefore is a unique virulence factor that is required for growth specifically when macrophages have heightened potential to restrict microbial replication.

### Introduction

*Legionella pneumophila* is a Gram-negative intracellular pathogen that is the causative agent of Legionnaires' pneumonia (McDade et al., 1977; Burnsed et al., 2007). The major natural reservoir for *L. pneumophila* is freshwater amoebae (Fields et al., 1984; Wadowsky et al., 1988). The disease in humans is initiated by inhalation of contaminated water sources, and progresses as a result of intracellular replication of *L. pneumophila* in alveolar macrophages (McDade et al., 1977; Horwitz and Silverstein, 1980). Replication of the microorganism during the disease process can be reproduced in culture, as the microorganism can replicate in a wide array of both phagocytic and normally non-phagocytic mammalian cells (Horwitz and Silverstein, 1980; Daisy et al., 1981; Yamamoto et al., 1988).

The cellular events required for the intracellular growth of *L. pneumophila* have been characterized in detail at the microscopic level (Horwitz and Silverstein, 1981; Horwitz, 1984; Nash et al., 1984; Payne and Horwitz, 1987). After *L. pneumophila* entry into host cells, bacteria reside in a membrane-bound compartment, called the *Legionella*-containing vacuole (LCV) (Horwitz, 1983a). The LCV acquires mitochondria, ribosomes and small vesicles derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) until it transforms into a rough ER-like compartment in which *L. pneumophila* initiates replication (Horwitz, 1983a; Tilney et al., 2001). During this process, the LCV avoids association with the endocytic network, as observed by the lack of association of this compartment with the late endosomal/lysosomal protein marker LAMP-1 (Horwitz, 1983b; Roy et al., 1998; Clemens et al., 2000). The ability of the LCV to evade fusion with the lysosome is crucial for the replication of *L. pneumophila* in the hostile host cell. The first round of replication in the LCV is completed 16–24 h after initial uptake, resulting in release of bacteria into the culture medium and initiation of a second round of infection in neighbouring cells. Most of the characterized mutants of *L. pneumophila* altered in intracellular growth rates exhibit their defects within a few hours of the initiation of replication (Berger and Isberg, 1993; Andrews et al., 1998; Segal et al., 1998; Sexton et al., 2004a; VanRheenen et al.,

EnhC is required for replication in TNF-α-stimulated macrophages 1907

2004; Bardill et al., 2005; Ninio et al., 2005; Laguna et al., 2006; Vincent and Vogel, 2006).

The *L. pneumophila* Dot/Icm proteins, which form a Type IVB protein translocation system, are required for biogenesis of the replication vacuole and intracellular replication (Berger and Isberg, 1993; Vogel et al., 1996; 1998; Segal and Shuman, 1997; Andrews et al., 1998; Segal et al., 1998; VanRheenen et al., 2004). An impressive array of bacterial protein substrates of the Dot/Icm system have been characterized, and there may be over 100 such proteins translocated to host cells (Nagai et al., 2002; Conover et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004; Luo and Isberg, 2004; Derre and Isberg, 2005; Machner and Isberg, 2006; Murata et al., 2006; Weber et al., 2006; L. Huang and R.R. Isberg, unpubl. data). Although Dot/Icm is absolutely required for intracellular replication, most of the substrates appear dispensable for intracellular growth.

A genetic screen for *L. pneumophila* proteins that enhance uptake into normally non-phagocytic cells identified a number of genes that may modulate this process (Cirillo et al., 2000). One of these ‘enhanced entry’ (*enh*) loci was *enhC* (lpg2639; Chien et al., 2004). An in-frame deletion of this gene in the *L. pneumophila* AA100 strain results in decreased entry into a pair of cell lines (Cirillo et al., 2000). A second screen also identified *enhC* based on an independent phenotype, in which insertion mutations were isolated that resulted in *L. pneumophila* mutants having low plating efficiency in the presence of overproduced Dot/Icm protein DotA (Conover et al., 2003). This second screen, which resulted in the identification of several genes encoding proteins involved in membrane integrity, suggested that EnhC may be involved in biogenesis of some components of the cell envelope rather than being a ligand for host cell recognition.

In response to *Legionella* infections in either cell cultures or animals, host cells will produce pro-inflammatory factors including tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interferon-γ (IFN-γ), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-12 (IL-12) (Blanchard et al., 1987; Matsiota-Bernard et al., 1993; Brieland et al., 1995; 1998; Skerrett and Martin, 1996; Susa et al., 1998; McHugh et al., 2000a; Losick and Isberg, 2006). Among these cytokines, TNF-α appears to be pivotal for the activation of phagocytes and the resolution of pneumonic infection (Blanchard et al., 1988; 1989; Skerrett et al., 1997). Treating genetically susceptible A/J mouse macrophages *in vitro* with TNF-α makes the macrophages more resistant to *Legionella* infection (McHugh et al., 2000b). Furthermore, the inhibitory effects of other cytokines, such as IL-12 and IFN-γ, on the replication of *L. pneumophila* are at least partially dependent on TNF-α (Matsiota-Bernard et al., 1993; Skerrett and Martin, 1996; Brieland et al., 1998). Given the capacity of TNF-α to restrict intracellular growth of the microorganism, *L. pneumophila* may have proteins that allow it to tolerate this aspect of host defence. Here we report that EnhC is one such protein, as mutants lacking this protein show specific defects in intracellular replication when there is enhanced TNF-α production by macrophages.

### Results

#### The absence of EnhC results in a delayed defect in intracellular growth

The *enhC* mutant was isolated in a screen for *L. pneumophila* mutants that showed low viability in the presence of overproduced DotA (Conover et al., 2003). An in-frame deletion of *enhC* in LP02 (a derivative of the Philadelphia-1 isolate) that expresses wild-type levels of DotA, however, showed levels of viability indistinguishable from the parental strain LP02, so this Δ*enhC* strain was directly tested for uptake by primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) from A/J mice (Fig. 1). Using our standard low multiplicity of infection (moi) conditions and the gentamicin protection assay, there was no uptake defect observed for Δ*enhC* at 2 h post infection (hpi) (Fig. 1; Experimental procedures). As the previous published uptake assays of *enhC* mutant used immortalized HEP-2 cells (Cirillo et al., 2000), uptake into the HEP-2 cell line was analysed at a variety of moi, as well. Once again, no defect was observed for Δ*enhC*, at moi ranging from 5 to 100 bacteria per cell (Fig. 1). We conclude that the absence of EnhC has no consequence on uptake of *L. pneumophila* Philadelphia-1 under our infection conditions.

To determine if loss of EnhC alters infection kinetics at later time points, *L. pneumophila* Δ*enhC* was introduced

onto BMDM monolayers for 72 h and its replication efficiency was monitored relative to the wild-type LP02 strain. The \( \Delta enhC \) strain grew at a similar rate compared with wild type during the first 24 h incubation (Fig. 2A). During the next 24 h period, however, there was a fivefold reduction in the replication rate of the \( \Delta enhC \) strain relative to wild type. This later period corresponded to the time at which bacteria released after an initial round of intracellular replication are predicted to disseminate to neighbouring cells and undergo a second round of intracellular growth. Plasmid-encoded EnhC could complement the growth defect of the mutant, although there was lower uptake by both this plasmid-harbouring strain as well as a vector control strain relative to plasmid-free strains (Fig. 2B).

The restriction of intracellular growth that occurs during the second day of growth was not observed when the amoeba Dictyostelium discoideum was challenged with the \( \Delta enhC \) mutant (Fig. 2C). Within amoebae, the growth of the mutant was indistinguishable from the parental strain throughout 72 h incubation. Therefore, there may be restrictive conditions that arise within macrophages after a 24 h replication period that are not apparent during growth within this amoebal species.

### EnhC is required for efficient growth in restrictive macrophages

To determine the reason for the defective intracellular growth of the \( \Delta enhC \) mutant in BMDM, a number of models were tested. Presumably, the defective replication during the second day of growth could be due to (i) delayed lysis after the first round of intracellular replication, (ii) reduced replication potential of the \( \Delta enhC \) strain after it is released from the first round of intracellular replication, or (iii) changes in the macrophage monolayers as a result of L. pneumophila infection that make the macrophages selectively restrictive to the mutant.

To test the delayed lysis model, \( \Delta enhC \) and wild-type LP02 were incubated with macrophage monolayers for 24 h to allow one round of intracellular growth and liberation from macrophages. Bacteria that remained macrophage-associated or found in the culture supernatant were then assessed for colony-forming units (cfu). The absence of EnhC had no effect on liberation of bacteria from macrophages, as the fraction of bacteria that remained macrophage-associated was unaffected in the \( \Delta enhC \) mutant (Fig. 3A).

We next determined if a round of intracellular growth rendered the \( \Delta enhC \) strain less competent than wild type at establishing further rounds of growth within macrophages. To this end, the bacterial progeny released after the first round of intracellular replication were collected from the culture supernatant of the infected monolayers at 24 hpi and applied to freshly prepared macrophage monolayers that never encountered bacteria. Intracellular growth was then monitored over the next 72 h to test if the \( \Delta enhC \) progeny from the first round were defective relative to the wild-type progeny in initiating and maintaining a new round of replication. The result of this re-infection assay (Fig. 3B) indicated that the \( \Delta enhC \) progeny liberated by macrophages had the same potential as wild type in terms of establishing a new round of growth during the first 24 h (Fig. 3B). On the other

Fig. 3. EnhC is required for growth in macrophages that have been previously exposed to *L. pneumophila*.

A. The absence of EnhC has no effect on the liberation of bacteria during replication within macrophages. At 24 h post infection, the culture supernatant from the infected macrophage monolayer was collected and plated out for cfu released into the supernatant (left column). After the supernatant was collected, the remaining monolayer was lysed (*Experimental procedures*) and plated out for cfu associated with macrophages (right column).

B. The ΔenhC progeny from 24 h intracellular growth are able to initiate a new round of replication after introduction onto a naïve macrophage monolayer. Bacterial progeny resulting from 24 h infection of BMDM with either LP02 or MLL101 (ΔenhC) were removed from macrophages, introduced onto naïve macrophages, and growth was followed over the noted time periods by monitoring cfu. Forty-eight hours post infection: \( P < 0.007 \), based on Student’s t-test. Data from (A) and (B) are mean ± standard deviation from triplicate samples of cfu determinations.

C. EnhC is required for efficient replication of super-infecting bacteria introduced onto macrophages previously exposed to *L. pneumophila*. Monolayers were incubated with either LP02 or MLL101 (ΔenhC) for 24 h at moi = 0.05 (noted as ‘pre-infection’). At this time point, MLL401 (GFP-LP02) or MLL501 (GFP-ΔenhC) was used to challenge each monolayer (‘super-infection’) at moi = 1. Fourteen hours later, the monolayers were fixed, and GFP-bacteria were counted in individual phagosomes (*Experimental procedures*). Pre-infection with LP02 and super-infection with GFP-ΔenhC, \(*P < 0.0007\); pre-infection with ΔenhC and super-infection with GFP-ΔenhC, \(*P < 0.003\). Both are based on Student’s t-test.

D. EnhC is dispensable for initial growth of bacteria introduced onto naïve macrophages. LP02 or ΔenhC was used to challenge naïve macrophage monolayers at moi = 1. Fourteen hours later, the monolayers were fixed and intracellular bacteria were counted in individual phagosomes. For (C) and (D), the number of bacteria per phagosome was recorded for 100 phagosomes in triplicate samples. Data represent mean ± standard deviation from observations of triplicate coverslips. All data shown in this figure represent typical experiment, repeated three times.

hand, after 24 h, a strong block in replication was observed again for the ΔenhC strain. This suggests that changes in the nature of the infected monolayer over time may attenuate intracellular growth of the mutant, and it is unlikely that one round of intracellular growth makes the mutant less competent than wild type at establishing new growth. Therefore, the monolayer appears to be restrictive for the mutant after 24 h of replication.

The intracellular growth curves showed apparent resumption of replication of the ΔenhC mutant after 48 h of incubation with macrophages (Figs 2 and 3B). This could be explained by a restriction at 24 h that results in a pause in replication of the mutant. Alternatively, there may exist a fraction of the population of the ΔenhC mutant that is incapable of initiating replication when the monolayer becomes restrictive, with the replication-competent frac-

tion growing at kinetics that are nearly identical to the wild-type strain. The following experiments are consistent with the latter explanation, as restriction appears to result in replicating and non-replicating populations of the ΔenhC mutant.

To provide evidence that macrophage monolayers become selectively restrictive for the ΔenhC strain after 24 h of infection, a super-infection assay was performed. BMDM were incubated with either the wild type or the mutant first (called ‘pre-infection’). Twenty-four hours later, the monolayers were challenged with green fluorescence protein (GFP)-expressing strains that harbour either wild-type or ΔenhC alleles (called ‘super-infection’). The super-infections were allowed to proceed for 14 h, fixed and the number of GFP-expressing bacteria in individual LCV was determined by microscopic observation (Fig. 3C). In macrophage monolayers pre-infected with *L. pneumophila*, the percentage of vacuoles containing single GFPΔenhC bacterium was increased twofold compared with vacuoles containing single GFP LP02 bacterium (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, the percentages of medium-sized (5–10 bacteria) and large-sized vacuoles (11–20 bacteria) harbouring the GFPΔenhC bacteria were correspondingly decreased. These results were independent of the strain used in the pre-infection, as monolayers pre-infected with either LP02 or ΔenhC were equally effective at restricting GFPΔenhC (Fig. 3C). The defective replication of the strain lacking EnhC observed in the monolayers pre-infected with *L. pneumophila* did not occur in the freshly prepared monolayers that had never encountered bacteria (Fig. 3D). This difference indicates that loss of EnhC results in enhanced sensitivity to the restrictive macrophage monolayers generated by prior exposure to *L. pneumophila*, with a fraction of the population unable to initiate replication in the presence of restrictive conditions.

Soluble factors from infected monolayers contribute to restriction of intracellular growth by ΔenhC

The restriction generated by pre-infection did not seem to require that the newly introduced bacteria and bacteria from pre-infection enter into identical macrophages, as many of the small vacuoles containing single GFP-bacterium were present in macrophages without bacteria from pre-infection (data not shown). The restriction conferred by infected monolayers might be due to some transmissible factors.

To test whether the restriction observed in infected monolayers was transmissible, macrophage culture supernatants from infected monolayers were tested for their ability to compromise intracellular growth of ΔenhC in freshly prepared macrophages that never encountered bacteria (called ‘naïve’ macrophages). Culture supern-

tants were collected from infected monolayers (moi = 0.05 for 24 h) and then subjected to filtration to remove bacteria in the supernatants. Culture supernatants generated in this fashion were called ‘conditioned media’. Naïve macrophages pre-treated with media conditioned by infections with either LP02 or the ΔenhC mutant strain were able to selectively restrict growth of the ΔenhC strain but not LP02 (Fig. 4A). Conditioned media from macrophages infected with either the ΔenhC strain or LP02 were equally effective at restriction (Fig. 4A). To confirm that conditioned medium decreased the growth rate in the absence of EnhC, the spectrum of LCV sizes was determined in monolayers pre-treated with conditioned medium (Fig. 4B). Compared with wild-type LP02, the distribution of vacuoles containing the mutant was skewed away from large vacuoles (>20 bacteria) (Fig. 4B). Once again, the source of the conditioned medium was not important, as culture supernatants from macrophages infected with either wild-type or the ΔenhC strain were equally competent at blocking intracellular growth of the mutant (Fig. 4B).

As conditioned medium was generated after filtration (Experimental procedures), it implied that soluble factors, such as soluble cytokines, might play a role in transmitting the restriction from infected monolayers to naïve monolayers. It should be pointed out that the conditioned medium did not restrict the growth of the mutant to the same extent as was observed in standard growth curves (compare Fig. 4 with Fig. 2), suggesting that additional cell-associated, matrix or unstable factors may contribute to the growth restriction.

EnhC is associated with resistance of *L. pneumophila* to restriction conferred by TNF-α treatment of macrophages

As pro-inflammatory cytokines including TNF-α, IL-6 and IL-1β have been reported to be secreted by macrophages challenged by *L. pneumophila* (Blanchard *et al.*, 1987; Arata *et al.*, 1993; McHugh *et al.*, 2000a), cytokine concentrations were determined in the conditioned media. As most of the growth restriction experiments (Figs 2 and 4) were performed under low-moi conditions to avoid the cytotoxicity effect of *L. pneumophila* (moi = 0.05), cytokine levels were determined under similar conditions. Detectable signals for TNF-α and macrophage chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) were observed in the conditioned media from macrophages infected with either LP02 or the ΔenhC strain for 24 h (Fig. 5A). Levels of these cytokines were almost identical for media from macrophages challenged by these two strains (Fig. 5A), as expected from the previous restriction experiments (Figs 3D and 4). The levels of four other cytokines, interleukin-12 p70 (IL-12p70), IL-10, IL-6 and IFN-γ, were not above the background levels (Fig. 5A, dashed line). In addition, there

was no detectable IL-1β in the conditioned media (data not shown). Although IL-6 and IL-1β have been reported in macrophage culture supernatants in response to *L. pneumophila* infections (Blanchard et al., 1987; Arata et al., 1993; Skerrett and Martin, 1996; McHugh et al., 2000b,c), such responses were observed using moi that are 20–200 times higher than used in our experiments.

As MCP-1 and TNF-α were detected in conditioned medium, each was added to naïve macrophage monolayers to determine if they caused enhanced restriction of the ΔenhC mutant relative to LP02. The addition of recombinant mouse MCP-1 to BMDM at a variety of concentrations ranging from 0 ng ml⁻¹ to 700 ng ml⁻¹ resulted in no restriction of either *L. pneumophila* strain during intracellular replication (data not shown). In contrast, at low concentrations recombinant mouse TNF-α interfered with growth of the ΔenhC strain (Fig. 5B). The defect observed in the mutant could be rescued completely by a plasmid-encoded EnhC (Fig. 5C). As the effective concentration of TNF-α was very close to the concentration of TNF-α detected in the conditioned media (70 pg ml⁻¹), and the extent of restriction of the mutant was similar to that observed with conditioned media (Fig. 4A), much of the restriction observed with conditioned media may be due to the presence of TNF-α secreted in response to *L. pneumophila* (Skerrett and Martin, 1996; McHugh et al., 2000a,b).

### EnhC is required for efficient avoidance of the endocytic pathway in TNF-α-treated macrophages

Formation of the *L. pneumophila* replication vacuole (LCV) requires bypass of entry into the endocytic pathway, as assayed by lack of colocalization of the LCV with the late endosome/lysosome protein LAMP-1 (Roy et al., 1998). To determine if loss of EnhC affects formation of the LCV in the presence of TNF-α, macrophages incubated in the presence or absence of TNF-α were challenged with *L. pneumophila* for 1 h and colocalization with LAMP-1 was detected by immunofluorescence (IF) microscopy. In untreated naïve macrophages, the absence of EnhC had no effect on colocalization of LAMP-1 with the LCV (Fig. 6A and B). In contrast, the addition of TNF-α to naïve macrophages resulted in a three- to fourfold increase in the percentage of vacuoles containing the ΔenhC strain that colocalized with LAMP-1 (Fig. 6B). TNF-α caused no such increase in colocalization with LAMP-1 for vacuoles bearing LP02 (Fig. 6B). The results obtained for the addition of conditioned medium were almost identical to those observed for TNF-α treatment of macrophages (Fig. 6B and C). These results are consistent with the model that the presence of TNF-α in conditioned medium restricts the replication vacuole formation by bacteria lacking EnhC.

Fig. 4. EnhC is required for intracellular growth in the presence of conditioned medium from infected macrophage monolayers.
A. Naïve macrophages were incubated with the culture supernatants from the uninfected monolayer (Mock medium), or the culture supernatants from monolayers infected by wild-type-LP02 or MLL101 (ΔenhC) (conditioned medium). After 16 h incubation, LP02 or MLL101 (ΔenhC) were introduced onto macrophages and infection was allowed to proceed for 24 h. The amount of intracellular growth was calculated from determining cfu at 2 h and 24 h post infection. Conditioned medium from monolayers infected by LP02, *P < 0.007*; conditioned medium from monolayers infected by ΔenhC, *P < 0.0004*. Both are based on Student’s t-test. Data are mean ± standard deviation from triplicate samples of a typical experiment. Experiment was repeated three times.
B. The same experimental procedure was performed as in (A), except that intracellular growth was monitored by scoring number of bacteria per phagosome at 17 h post infection, following procedure in Fig. 3D. The number of bacteria per phagosome was recorded for 100 phagosomes in triplicate samples for each strain. Student’s t-test on the category of large vacuoles (> 20 bacteria) containing ΔenhC, *P < 0.0003*, if the source of conditioned medium was the infection by LP02; *P < 0.005*, if the source of conditioned medium was the infection by ΔenhC. Data represent mean ± standard deviation from observations of triplicate coverslips of a representative experiment, repeated three times.

A. MCP-1 and TNF-$\alpha$ accumulate in conditioned medium. The concentrations of six cytokines or chemokines in conditioned medium were measured by ELISA (Experimental procedures).

B. TNF-$\alpha$ selectively restricts intracellular growth of MLL101 ($\Delta enhC$). Cytokine was added at the noted concentrations for 3 h prior to introduction of $L$. pneumophila (Experimental procedures). Colony-forming unit (cfu) was determined at 2 h and 24 h post infection. Data represent mean $\pm$ standard deviation from triplicate samples of a representative experiment. Experiment was repeated three times. *P < 0.003 (Student’s t-test).

C. The growth defect of MLL101 ($\Delta enhC$) in TNF-$\alpha$-treated macrophages can be complemented by introducing intact enhC on a plasmid. *P < 0.001 (Student’s t-test). Results are determined as in (B). Experiment was repeated three times.

As the $L$. pneumophila Dot/Icm protein translocation system is required for LCV formation (Roy et al., 1998), it is possible that the absence of EnhC reduces the translocation efficiency of Dot/Icm system. This was not the case, at least for naive macrophages, as the translocation efficiencies of several known substrates (SidC, LidA and SidM) were not affected by loss of EnhC (data not shown). Furthermore, loss of EnhC did not affect the translocation efficiency of SidC in macrophages treated with TNF-$\alpha$ (data not shown). Although it is possible that EnhC is required for the translocations of specific substrates in restrictive macrophages, the absence of EnhC does not appear to cause wholesale defects on Dot/Icm system. Alternatively, EnhC may be a Dot/Icm substrate, and its absence could cause the TNF-$\alpha$-specific effects. If staining of infected macrophages and purified phagosomes showed no evidence for translocation of EnhC by Dot/Icm system (data not shown) and, as will be shown below, the localization of EnhC in $L$. pneumophila is inconsistent with this latter model.

Post-exponentially induced and envelope-associated EnhC localizes primarily in the periplasmic space

A number of $L$. pneumophila proteins associated with intracellular growth are upregulated in post-exponential phase (VanRheenen et al., 2006; Vincent and Vogel,

A. TNF-α increases defective trafficking of vacuoles harbouring a mutant lacking EnhC. Displayed are immunofluorescence images of macrophages incubated with MLL101 (ΔenhC) for 1 h in the presence or absence of TNF-α (Experimental procedures). The position of vacuole is indicated by anti-Legionella staining (left), the localization of LAMP-1 is revealed by anti-LAMP-1 staining (middle) and the merged images are in the right panel.

B. EnhC is required for efficient bypass of the endocytic pathway in the presence of TNF-α. The percentage of vacuoles associated with LAMP-1 was determined in macrophages incubated with 70 pg ml⁻¹ TNF-α or in its absence. P < 0.00001 (Student’s t-test).

C. EnhC is required for efficient bypass of the endocytic pathway in the presence of conditioned medium. The percentage of vacuoles associated with LAMP-1 was determined in macrophages incubated with medium conditioned by previous infection with *L. pneumophila* or in its absence. P < 0.0006 (Student’s t-test).

portion of EnhC was found in the supernatants (Fig. 7B, LP02, lane S), indicating that there may be a small amount of the protein in the cytoplasm, or a fraction is present in the periplasm that could not be released by lysozyme treatment. The remainder of EnhC was found in the Triton X-100-insoluble membrane fraction, so a portion of EnhC may associate with the outer membrane or be assembled into a Triton X-100-resistant protein complex in the periplasmic space (Fig. 7B, LP02, lane O). Although the fractionation assay could not demonstrate a single fraction containing EnhC, the results indicated that the majority of EnhC was probably localized in the bacterial envelope and, in particular, the periplasmic space.

To further confirm the association of EnhC with the envelope, intact LP02 grown to post-exponential phase was probed by using a membrane-impermeant amino-reactive biotinylation reagent (Sulfo-NHS-LC-biotin) to label bacterial proteins (Experimental procedures). This reagent is small enough to penetrate the outer membrane porins of intact *L. pneumophila*, so proteins having amino

groups exposed in the outer membrane, periplasm or periplasmic face of the inner membrane will be covalently modified with biotin. After biotinylation, bacteria were lysed and biotin-modified proteins were pelleted using streptavidin-linked beads (Experimental procedures). EnhC could be labelled by the biotinylation reagent and pulled down by the streptavidin beads as could DotG, an inner membrane protein thought to have a large periplasmically localized domain (Fig. 7C) (Vincent et al., 2006). In contrast, the cytoplasmic protein ICDH was not pelleted by the streptavidin beads (Fig. 7C). The results from this assay further confirmed the association of EnhC with the bacterial envelope.

The absence of EnhC results in increased sensitivity to stress conditions

Fractionation of the ΔenhC strain resulted in some leakage of the cytoplasmic ICDH after lysozyme treatment in hyperosmotic buffer, consistent with a dysfunction

The presence of NaCl in bacteriological medium reduces the viability of *L. pneumophila* harbouring an intact Dot/Icm system, presumably because the Dot/Icm translocator disrupts Na⁺ homeostasis (Sadosky et al., 1993). In some strain backgrounds, mutations in the *dotL* gene result in enhanced sensitivity to this cation, perhaps due to misregulation of envelope proteins (Buscher et al., 2005). The absence of EnhC similarly resulted in enhanced sensitivity to NaCl, with more than 10-fold lower viability in the presence of 0.65% NaCl relative to the wild-type LP02 strain (Fig. S1). To further pursue this result, sensitivity to H₂O₂ in culture medium was analysed, as resistance to this reagent is a better-defined and more specific measure of the bacterial stress response (Gonzalez-Flecha and Demple, 2000). Post-exponential bacteria were incubated at 25°C in culture medium containing increasing amounts of H₂O₂ (*Experimental procedures*), and bacterial viability was determined by cfu. The mutant lacking EnhC was three to four times more sensitive to 5 mM H₂O₂ relative to wild type and about 10 times more sensitive to 15 mM H₂O₂ than wild type (Fig. 8A and B). This defect could be complemented by the presence of a plasmid-encoded *enhC* gene (Fig. 8B), indicating that EnhC contributes to the resistance of post-exponential

A. EnhC is upregulated in post-exponential phase. Bacteria grown to the noted A₆₀₀ were harvested and fractionated by SDS-PAGE and immunoprobed with anti-EnhC or anti-isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH) (*Experimental procedures*).

B. EnhC is localized to the periplasm and the Triton X-100-insoluble fraction. Subcellular fractionation assays were performed to localize EnhC in *L. pneumophila* (*Experimental procedures*). Lysozyme-treated bacteria were sonicated and extracts were separated into membrane-associated and soluble fractions by centrifugation. Membrane pellets were then divided into Triton X-100-soluble and -insoluble fractions. Fractions were then gel separated and probed with antibody against EnhC or ICDH.

S: cytosolic proteins, supernatant after pelleting sonicate in ultracentrifuge. I: Triton X-100-soluble fraction of membrane pellets. O: Triton X-100-insoluble fraction of membrane pellets.

C. EnhC is accessible to membrane-impermeant biotinylation reagent. The biotinylation reagent was added to intact bacteria to label proteins, then the reagent was blocked, cells were lysed, biotinylated proteins were precipitated with streptavidin-agarose beads, and samples were gel fractionated prior to probing with the noted antibody (*Experimental procedures*). T: total protein. B: fraction precipitated by streptavidin beads. S: fraction in the supernatant after streptavidin-agarose treatment. DotG was probed as a positive control for proteins localized to the periplasmic face of the inner membrane.

functional envelope in post-exponential phase (Fig. 7B, Δ*enhC*, lane P). Such a defect could result in enhanced sensitivity of post-exponential bacteria to a variety of stress conditions, at least partially explaining the lowered replication potential of the Δ*enhC* mutant in the presence of enhanced restriction during the second day of intracellular growth. Therefore, the Δ*enhC* mutant was grown in the absence of host cells and was tested for its resistance to a pair of stress conditions.

Post-exponential bacteria were incubated in AYE medium containing different concentrations of H₂O₂ for 16 h at room temperature. The efficiency of survival was calculated by determining cfu before and after 16 h incubation with H₂O₂ (*Experimental procedures*).

Fig. 9. Growth phase regulation and punctate localization of EnhC in *L. pneumophila*.

A. Immunofluorescence (IF) staining for EnhC in post-exponential-phase *L. pneumophila* reveals a punctate pattern. Bacteria (*A*<sub>600</sub> = 3.7) were probed by DAPI for bacterial DNA (left) and anti-EnhC (middle).

B. Increased EnhC expression during post-exponential phase as detected by IF. Probing for EnhC was performed on bacteria from either exponential (*A*<sub>600</sub> = 1.8) or post-exponential phase (*A*<sub>600</sub> = 3.7). The histograms showing bacterial counts at different IF intensity levels were generated after image analysis of cover slips containing stained bacterial preparations (*Experimental procedures*). Data represent typical results. Experiment was repeated three times.

L. pneumophila to H₂O₂ stress. Therefore, by a pair of measures, the mutant appeared to have enhanced stress sensitivity, perhaps due to a partially defective bacterial envelope. This may potentiate the sensitivity of the mutant to the increased restriction that occurs during the second day of growth in macrophage culture.

EnhC is associated with the bacterial envelope in a punctate pattern

Using anti-EnhC antibody, IF staining was performed on *L. pneumophila* grown to exponential phase (*A*<sub>600</sub> = 1.8) and post-exponential phase (*A*<sub>600</sub> = 3.7), to visualize the localization of EnhC in bacteria. We were unable to detect EnhC on the surface of bacteria by IF staining in the absence of fixation (data not shown). The localization of EnhC in fixed post-exponential-phase bacteria revealed pronounced staining of EnhC around the periphery of bacteria (Fig. 9A). The staining for EnhC appeared to be punctate in many bacteria (Fig. 9A, enlarged images). When IF images were analyzed (*Experimental procedures*), 82 ± 11% of post-exponential-phase bacteria gave a positive signal above the threshold, whereas 42 ± 11% of exponential-phase bacteria were stained positively.

As the percentage of exponential-phase bacteria that stained positively for EnhC was slightly higher than expected from the results of Western analysis (Fig. 7A), the IF intensity in each positively stained bacterium was determined individually and the data were plotted as a histogram (Fig. 9B, *Experimental procedures*). The IF intensity of EnhC in exponential-phase bacteria ranged from 8 units of pixel intensity per pixel (PIPP) to 18 PIPP. In contrast, the intensity of EnhC in post-exponential-phase bacteria ranged from 63 PIPP to 120 PIPP. The higher intensity of EnhC in post-exponential-phase bacteria was also verified by the fact that the mean intensity of EnhC for post-exponential-phase bacteria (85 ± 5 PIPP) was about sixfold higher than that for exponential-phase bacteria (15 ± 5 PIPP). The quantification results for IF staining combined with the results of Western analysis (Fig. 7A) suggested that the association of EnhC with the bacterial envelope was greatly enhanced during post-exponential phase.

Discussion

Here we show that *L. pneumophila* EnhC is required for persistent intracellular growth in macrophages. The delayed growth defect observed in a ΔenhC mutant (Fig. 2) is easily distinguishable from the previously observed phenotype of most *L. pneumophila* intracellular growth mutants, which show lowered growth rates relative to wild type beginning at the earliest time points of the replication cycle (Berger and Isberg, 1993; Segal and Shuman, 1997; Andrews et al., 1998; Sexton et al., 2004b; VanRheenen et al., 2004; Bardill et al., 2005; Ninio et al., 2005; Laguna et al., 2006; Vincent and Vogel, 2006). Loss of EnhC did not result in altered intracellular growth if macrophages had not been previously exposed to bacteria, but only appeared when macrophage cultures had started to accumulate cytokines (Figs 3 and 4). Consistent with a defect dependent on the production of cytokine, no such depression in intracellular growth was observed when bacteria were grown within *D. discoideum* amoebae (Fig. 2C). Previous work (Blanchard et al., 1987; Arata et al., 1993; McHugh et al., 2000a) indicated that cytokines, especially TNF-α, could restrict the replication of *L. pneumophila*. At the moi conditions used here (moi = 0.05), TNF-α only accumulates to a low concentration, but this level of cytokine was sufficient to selectively interfere with the replication of ΔenhC (Fig. 5). Although it may be argued that any protection conferred by EnhC is limited to rather low levels of TNF-α, it should be emphasized that in the absence of external macrophage activation, the level of TNF-α in macrophage cultures never reaches the concentrations sufficient to interfere with the intracellular growth of wild-type *L. pneumophila*. This supports the model that EnhC is required for *L. pneumophila* to resist the restriction conferred by TNF-α found in macrophage cultures after 24 h exposure to bacteria.

The observed trafficking defect of vacuoles containing the ΔenhC mutant in restrictive macrophages (Fig. 6), combined with the observation that the presence of conditioned medium (Fig. 4) or TNF-α (Fig. 5) caused selective inhibition of intracellular growth by the mutant, is consistent with the model that the delayed growth defect of the mutant is at least partially due to improper targeting of the vacuole to the late endosome. Improper trafficking does not appear to be caused by a general defect in Dot/Icm translocation, as lack of EnhC did not affect the translocation efficiency of SidC (a known substrate of Dot/Icm) in both naïve macrophages and macrophages treated with TNF-α (data not shown). However, these results do not exclude the possibility that a specific set of unknown substrates required for LCV formation are inefficiently translocated in the ΔenhC mutant.

It is unclear how TNF-α stimulation leads to selective restriction of bacteria lacking EnhC, nor why this treatment leads to improper trafficking of the LCV. TNF-α is a pleiotropic pro-inflammatory cytokine important for a wide range of host responses, including cell apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation, activation of NF-κB as well as stimulating production of a number of additional cytokines (Aggarwal, 2003). Furthermore, it has the ability to induce the productions of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (Bubici et al., 2006; Dutta et al., 2006). Among the responses predicted from these divergent signalling pathways activated by TNF-α, ROS and RNS have been suggested to be involved in the inhibition of *L. pneumophila* (Brieland et al., 1995; Skerrett and Martin, 1996). In fact, we observed that the ΔenhC mutant showed increased sensitivity to H₂O₂ relative to the wild-type strain (Fig. 8), suggesting that ROS produced downstream of TNF-α signalling may be partially responsible for the reduced growth rates occurring in macrophages starting at the 24 h time point. Attack by these species on the ΔenhC mutant after contact with TNF-α-stimulated macrophages may cause increased targeting of the more susceptible mutant to the endocytic compartment. The observation that production of spheroplasts from ΔenhC resulted in release of the cytoplasmic protein ICDH (Fig. 7B), as well as the increased sensitivity of the ΔenhC mutant to NaCl in bacteriological medium (Fig. S1), indicates that the ΔenhC strain has a fragile bacterial envelope that may contribute to this susceptibility. These clues about the mutant combined with the observation that EnhC is associated with the bacterial envelope (Figs 7 and 9) suggest that EnhC may be involved in stability of the bacterial envelope. *L. pneumophila* lacking EnhC may sensitize the bacterium to antimicrobial tactics used by restrictive macrophages, such as ROS-dependent killing.

Although *enhC* was originally identified as a gene required for maximal uptake of *L. pneumophila* into cell lines (Cirillo et al., 2000), our studies indicated there was no defect in uptake of a ΔenhC mutant (Figs 1 and 2). The inability to reproduce the published defect does not fully eliminate the possibility that EnhC plays a role in bacterial uptake, as the growth conditions and the parental bacterial strain analysed in this study differ from the previous work. Conflicting results on uptake of *L. pneumophila* have been observed previously (Hilbi et al., 2001; Watarai et al., 2001). However, our studies do argue that EnhC primarily localizes in the periplasm (Fig. 7B), making it unlikely that it is a ligand for a mammalian cell surface receptor. We were also unable to detect EnhC on the surface of bacteria by IF staining in the absence of fixation (data not shown), which is inconsistent with the protein being a surface-exposed adhesin.

Although EnhC allows resistance to low levels of TNF-α as well as to conditioned media (Figs 4 and 5),

neither treatment generates the level of restriction observed during a standard growth curve (Fig. 2), so soluble mediators cannot fully explain the phenotype of the ΔenhC mutant. Restriction of the mutant may also include cell-associated responses that cannot be transferred by conditioned media, or which synergize with TNF-α to inhibit replication of the microorganism. Further analysis of the role of EnhC in supporting intracellular growth will require identifying the cell-associated factors involved in restriction, as well as understanding how the response to TNF-α results in restriction in the absence of EnhC.

The observation that the mutant lacking enhC exhibited a defect in intracellular growth only after accumulation of cytokine in the culture raises a problem for determining the source of the selective pressures that maintain this gene. As there is no evidence for transmission of L. pneumophila between animal hosts, intracellular growth in the presence of low levels of cytokines is an unlikely source of selection for maintenance of the enhC gene. Rather, selective pressures probably result from passage between amoebae or survival of the bacterium in water supplies. Although the replication efficiencies of the mutant and wild-type L. pneumophila strains were indistinguishable in the amoebal species D. discoideum (Fig. 2C), this result does not exclude the model that there are unicellular hosts that can mimic the restrictive properties observed in a macrophage culture. Furthermore, the fact that the absence of enhC results in sensitivity of the bacterium to a variety of chemical treatments (Fig. 8 and Fig. S1) raises the possibility that selection outside of a host could cause retention of a gene that is only important when a macrophage has increased potential to restrict survival of microorganisms. Identification of the molecular target of EnhC should provide a key to understanding how this protein supports survival of the microorganism in a variety of environments.


### Experimental procedures

#### Bacterial strains, plasmids, reagents and cell culture

All bacterial strains and plasmids used in this work were listed in Table 1. All PCR primers used in this work were listed in Table S1. Charcoal Yeast Extract agar (CYE) or Charcoal Yeast Extract Thymidine agar (CYET) plates and ACES-buffered Yeast Extract (AYE) broth were used to cultivate *L. pneumophila* in vitro as described (Feeley et al., 1979; Berger and Isberg, 1993). Thymidine was added at a concentration of 100 μg ml⁻¹ when needed. *L. pneumophila* strain LP02 (*thyA⁻ hsdR rpsL*) (Berger et al., 1994), a thymine-auxotrophic derivative of the Philadelphia-1 isolate, was used as wild type in all experiments. The ΔenhC strain (MLL101), an in-frame deletion of enhC, was constructed in the LP02 background as described previously (Rankin et al., 2002). Briefly, suicide vector pSR47s (pML101) containing genomic regions flanking enhC was integrated into the chromosome via homologous recombination and integration events were selected by kanamycin resistance followed by selecting for a second cross-over using sucrose resistance. Recombinants were screened for the presence of the deletion by PCR and Western analysis. The EnhC⁺ complementation plasmid (pML201) was constructed by introducing enhC into the vector pJB908 (Table 1). Bacterial strains (MLL401, MLL501) expressing GFP were constructed by introducing GFP-expressing plasmid pAM239 (Table 1) into bacteria.

Mouse BMDM were prepared from the femurs of female A/J mice (Jackson Laboratories) (Swanson and Isberg, 1995) and cultivated in RPMI 1640 (Invitrogen-Gibco) with 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Gibco). HEP-2 cells (ATCC CCL23) were passaged in DMEM media (Invitrogen-Gibco) containing 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco). The chemical reagents used in this article were from Sigma (St Louis, MO) if not stated otherwise.

#### Gentamicin protection assay to measure bacterial internalization

BMDM and HEP-2 cells were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) at a density of 4 × 10⁵ cells per well and 2.5 × 10⁵ cells per well respectively. Post-exponential-phase (*A*₆₀₀ = 3.7–3.9) motile bacteria cultures were diluted and added

into cell monolayers at desired moi. SpectraMax A5 model (Molecular Devices) spectrophotometer was used for all $A_{600}$ readings of bacteria in this article. The HEP-2/BMDM cultures were placed in a plate carrier in the Hermile Z 360 K model (National Labnet) centrifuge and spun at 1000 r.p.m. for 5 min. The plates were moved to $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C} 5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for 2 h before washing three times with PBS. The cells were incubated in culture medium containing $100 \mu \mathrm{g} \mathrm{ml}^{-1}$ gentamicin for 2 h to kill the extracellular bacteria. After gentamicin treatment, the cells were washed with PBS again before they were lysed in the presence of 0.02% saponin. After lysis, the internalized bacteria were measured by plating for cfu on CYET plates. Uptake percentage was determined by the percentage of the inoculum that survived gentamicin killing.

### Intracellular growth assays

The intracellular growth of *L. pneumophila* in BMDM was measured by change in cfu (Berger et al., 1994). For all studies monitoring the intracellular growth of *L. pneumophila* in BMDM by following cfu, BMDM were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) at $4 \times 10^{5}$ cells per well. Motile bacteria grown to post-exponential phase ($A_{600}=3.7-3.9$) in AYE broth were diluted in RPMI and added to BMDM at an moi = 0.05. After 2 h, all wells were washed with RPMI 1640 to synchronize the infection. Some wells were then lysed with 0.02% saponin and incubated on CYET or CYE plates for the initial cell-associated cfu. The remaining wells were lysed at 24 hpi, 48 hpi and 72 hpi sequentially to monitor the bacterial intracellular growth over 3 days. Standard deviations were calculated based on cfu from triplicate infected wells.

The intracellular growth of *L. pneumophila* in *D. discoideum* was measured by change in cfu as described previously (Li et al., 2005). *D. discoideum* were seeded in 24-well tissue culture plates (Falcon) at $5 \times 10^{5}$ cells per well. The cells were equilibrated at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ for 3 h and then infected by post-exponential-phase *L. pneumophila* at moi = 0.05. After 2 h, all wells were washed to synchronize the infection. Some wells were lysed with 0.02% saponin and plated for the initial cell-associated cfu. The remaining wells were lysed at 24 hpi, 48 hpi and 72 hpi sequentially to monitor the bacterial intracellular growth over 3 days in *D. discoideum*.

For all studies in this article requiring IF assay to visualize *L. pneumophila* in macrophages, BMDM were seeded onto circular glass coverslips (Fisher) in 24-well Falcon dishes at $2 \times 10^{5}$ cells per coverslip. For super-infection, the BMDM monolayer was first infected at moi = 0.05 for 24 h by LP02 or MLL101 ($\Delta enhC$), followed by super-infection by MLL401 (GFP-LP02) or MLL501 (GFP-$\Delta enhC$) at moi = 1 for 14 h. After super-infection, the cells were fixed and blocked in goat serum (Roy et al., 1998). Before permeabilization of BMDM, extracellular bacteria were stained by anti-*L. pneumophila* rabbit serum (1:10 000) (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory) and secondary anti-rabbit Cascade blue (1:500) (Invitrogen). After permeabilizing BMDM with cold methanol, total bacteria were stained by anti-*L. pneumophila* rabbit serum and secondary anti-rabbit Texas red (1:500) (Invitrogen). When observed under microscope, only phagosomes containing GFP-bacteria stained by Texas red but not Cascade blue were scored. For IF experiments without performing super-infection, moi of 1 was used. The intracellular bacteria were scored at 14 hpi.

### Re-infection assay on BMDM

BMDM were incubated with *L. pneumophila* (moi 0.05) for 24 h at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The bacterial progeny released from macrophages and present in the macrophage culture supernatant were collected and applied to freshly prepared macrophages to initiate new infections with an moi approximately equal to 0.05. Subsequent growth was followed by determining cfu over time. If the lysis efficiency of bacteria at 24 hpi in primary infection was measured, the macrophage culture supernatant was collected at 24 hpi and plated out for the cfu released into the supernatant. The remaining macrophage monolayer was lysed by 0.02% saponin and plated out for the cfu associated with macrophages.

### Assay for growth of *L. pneumophila* in BMDM monolayers treated with conditioned medium

BMDM were incubated with LP02 or MLL101 ($\Delta enhC$) at moi = 0.05 for 24 h. The culture media for the infected monolayers were collected and passed through Steri-flip filters (0.22 $\mu$m) (Millipore) to remove bacteria and generate bacteria-free 'conditioned media'. Freshly prepared BMDM were incubated with LP02 infection-conditioned media or MLL101 infection-conditioned media for ~16 h at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$. The treated BMDM were then incubated with LP02 or MLL101 for 2 h at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ before washing with RPMI and addition of fresh RPMI containing 10% FBS to BMDM. To determine cfu, moi = 0.05 was used; for microscopic assay to determine the distribution of phagosome sizes, moi = 1 was used. To determine cfu, BMDM were lysed at 2 hpi and 24 hpi. To determine phagosome size, BMDM were fixed at 17 hpi.

### Measurement of the concentrations of cytokines in the conditioned medium

The concentrations for IL-12p70, TNF-$\alpha$, IFN-$\gamma$, MCP-1, IL-10 and IL-6 were determined by ELISA-based cytometric bead array kit (BD Biosciences). A slightly modified protocol based on the manufacturer’s instructions was used (Auerbuch and Isberg, 2007). The concentration for IL-1$\beta$ in the conditioned medium was determined by mouse IL-1$\beta$ ELISA kit (eBioscience).

### Determination of the intracellular growth of *L. pneumophila* in BMDM treated by TNF-$\alpha$ or MCP-1

Freshly prepared BMDM were treated by either *Escherichia coli*-expressed recombinant mouse TNF-$\alpha$ (R&D Systems) or mouse MCP-1 (R&D Systems) in RPMI + 10% FBS at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}, 5 \% \mathrm{CO}_{2}$ for at least 3 h. The ED$_{50}$ of TNF-$\alpha$ determined by TNF-mediated cytotoxicity in the mouse L-929 cell line in the presence of the metabolic inhibitor actinomycin D is about $50 \mathrm{pg} \mathrm{ml}^{-1}$ (R&D Systems). The ED$_{50}$ of MCP-1 determined by its ability to chemotact hCCR2A-transfected mouse BaF/3 cells is about $4 \mathrm{ng} \mathrm{ml}^{-1}$ (R&D Systems). Post-exponential-phase *L. pneumophila* cultures were appropriately diluted and added to macrophages at an moi = 0.05. Two hours later, macrophages were washed by RPMI to synchronize the infection and then fresh RPMI containing 10% FBS was added to BMDM. At 2 hpi
and 24 hpi, two sets of macrophages were lysed by 0.02% saponin and incubated on CYE or CYET plates to determine initial cfu associated with macrophages and the cfu obtained after 24 h of intracellular growth. The cfu obtained at 24 hpi was divided by the cfu at 2 hpi to determine fold growth of *L. pneumophila* after 24 h of intracellular growth.

### Assay for colocalization of LAMP-1 with the LCV

Freshly prepared BMDM were treated by *E. coli*-expressed recombinant mouse TNF-α (R&D Systems) in RPMI + 10% FBS at 37°C, 5% CO₂ for 3 h. Untreated BMDM or TNF-treated macrophages were then incubated with post-exponential-phase bacteria at moi = 1. After 1 h of infection, macrophages were fixed and blocked (Roy *et al.*, 1998). Extracellular bacteria and intracellular bacteria were distinguished as described in intracellular growth assays (above). LAMP-1 protein was detected by rat anti-LAMP-1 (1D4B) primary monoclonal antibody (Hybridoma Bank at the University of Iowa) using a dilution of 1:100 and secondary anti-rat FITC (Invitrogen).

### Anti-EnhC antibody production

The amino-terminal signal sequence of EnhC was replaced by six histidines to generate a His₆-tagged version of EnhC that could be purified by using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid chromatography (Qiagen). The purified His₆-EnhC was injected into rabbits to raise anti-EnhC serum (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory). Rabbit anti-EnhC polyclonal antibody was purified by affinity purification (Laguna *et al.*, 2006). Briefly, Affigel-10 beads (Bio-Rad) were linked with purified His₆-EnhC. Serum was added to an equal volume of beads, incubated overnight at 4°C, and anti-EnhC antibody was eluted using Glycine/HCl buffer (pH = 2.5). Purified anti-EnhC antibody recognized a single protein with predicted size from LP02 (wild-type) extracts, but did not recognize any protein from ΔenhC extracts.

### Assays for translocations of Dot/Icm substrates in the strain lacking EnhC or wild-type bacteria

BMDM were seeded onto glass coverslips in 24-well Falcon dishes at 2 × 10⁵ cells per coverslip and incubated with motile post-exponential-phase bacteria (*A*₆₀₀ = 3.7–3.9) for 2 h or 14 h at moi = 1. If TNF-α treatment was analysed, macrophages were treated for 3 h before infection. After infection, macrophages were fixed and blocked (Roy *et al.*, 1998). Using rat anti-*Legionella* serum (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory), extracellular bacteria and intracellular bacteria were distinguished as described in intracellular growth assays (above). The translocation of SidC or EnhC was detected by rabbit anti-SidC antibody (Luo and Isberg, 2004) or rabbit anti-EnhC antibody (Pocono Rabbit Farm and Laboratory), using a dilution of 1:500, followed by probing with anti-rabbit FITC (Invitrogen). If the digitonin extraction procedure was used on bulk cultures to assess translocations of SidC, SidM or LidA, published procedures were used (Luo and Isberg, 2004; Derre and Isberg, 2005; Machner and Isberg, 2006). IF staining on purified phagosomes to test the translocation of EnhC was as described (Conover *et al.*, 2003).

### Bacterial fractionation

The protocol for subcellular fractionation of *L. pneumophila* was slightly modified from previous protocols (Roy and Isberg, 1997). About 20 ml of post-exponential *L. pneumophila* grown in AYE medium (*A*₆₀₀ = 3.7–3.9) was pelleted at 5000 g for 20 min. The bacterial pellet was re-suspended in 0.5 ml of 200 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) and 0.5 ml of sucrose buffer [1 M sucrose, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0)] was then added. Then 10 μl of 0.5 M EDTA (pH = 8.0), 10 μl of 10 mg ml⁻¹ lysozyme and 1 ml of H₂O were sequentially added to the bacterial suspension. The suspension was then incubated on ice for 30 min to form spheroplasts. MgCl₂ was added to a final concentration = 20 mM and spheroplasts were pelleted for 20 min at 5000 g. The supernatant after centrifugation was collected as Periplasmic (P) fraction (~2 ml). The spheroplasts were re-suspended in 5 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) and lysed on ice by sonication with three sonic bursts at 40% intensity. Cell disruptor 200 (Branson) was used for sonication. Unlysed spheroplasts were pelleted at 5000 g for 20 min. Fifty per cent of the supernatant (~2.5 ml) was saved as fraction T, representing both soluble and membrane-associated proteins. The other half of the supernatant was subjected to ultracentrifugation at 100 000 g for 1 h. The supernatant (~2.5 ml) was saved as fraction S, representing soluble cytoplasmic proteins. The pellet (membrane fraction) was re-suspended in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) before 10% Triton X-100 was added to a final concentration of 1%. The membrane fraction was extracted on ice for 30 min before another ultracentrifugation step (100 000 g, 30 min). The supernatant was saved as Triton X-100-soluble proteins (fraction I ~ 1 ml). The pellet containing Triton X-100-insoluble proteins was re-suspended in 1 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) (fraction O). Fractions were analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (Roy and Isberg, 1997). The gel loading volumes for different fractions were equivalent to the samples extracted from 3 × 10⁸ bacteria. EnhC was detected by probing with rabbit anti-EnhC diluted 1:10 000. ICDH was detected by using rabbit anti-ICDH at 1:30 000 dilution (gift from Dr L. Sonenshein, Department of Microbiology, Tufts University).

### Bacterial surface labelling assay

A total of 2 × 10⁹ post-exponential-phase *L. pneumophila* bacteria were pelleted at 8000 g for 15 min. The bacteria were washed once with cold PBS and then re-suspended in 1 ml of cold PBS. Freshly made Sulfo-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce Chemical) stock solution (6.5 mg ml⁻¹ in PBS) was added to the bacterial suspension to a final concentration = 370 μg ml⁻¹ to label free amino groups on the proteins exported across face of bacterial inner membrane. The bacterial suspension was left on ice for 30 min. The labelling process was stopped by addition of NH₄Cl to final concentration = 50 mM and incubating the suspension on ice for 15 min. Bacterial cells were washed three times in cold PBS then lysed in 100 μl of 1% SDS, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0), 1 mM EDTA. Bacterial cells were boiled for 2 min and then cooled down to room temperature prior to the addition of 900 μl of ice-cold buffer containing 2% Triton X-100, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH = 8.0) 1 mM EDTA and 150 mM NaCl. The diluted lysate was cleared by centrifugation (15 000 g for 10 min, 4°C). The supernatant after centrifugation was split into two halves. One half was saved and subjected to methanol-chloroform precipitation (Derre and

Isberg, 2005) and labelled as T (Total input for pull-down). The other half was incubated with 50 μl gel bed volume of streptavidin-agarose beads (Pierce Chemical) overnight on rolling drum at 4°C. After overnight adsorption, the beads were pelleted and the supernatant was subjected to methanol-chloroform precipitation and labelled as S (Supernatant after pull-down). The agarose beads were washed at least three times with cold PBS before SDS sample buffer was added to the beads. The sample was labelled as B (beads) after the beads were boiled in sample buffer for 5 min. Samples were then fractionated on SDS-PAGE and revealed by immunoblotting. DotG was detected by anti-DotG at dilution = 1:12 000 (Vincent et al., 2006).

### Assay for the resistance of L. pneumophila to H₂O₂ stress

Motile, post-exponential-phase bacteria (A₆₀₀ = 3.7–3.9) were pelleted at 8000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was re-suspended in fresh AYE broth containing varying concentrations of H₂O₂ (0 mM, 2 mM, 5 mM and 15 mM). A small portion of the re-suspended culture was diluted and plated for input cfu before exposing to H₂O₂. The remaining culture was slowly shaken on a platform shaker (Model: Innova 2000, New Brunswick Scientific) at 28 r.p.m., room temperature, for 16 h. After 16 h, the culture was diluted and plated for output cfu surviving H₂O₂-containing medium. The percentage of surviving bacteria was determined by dividing the output cfu by the input cfu.

### Assay for the resistance of L. pneumophila to NaCl stress

Post-exponential-phase (A₆₀₀ = 3.7–3.9) motile bacteria were diluted and incubated on CYET plates for input cfu and on CYET plates with 0.65% NaCl for cfu resistant to NaCl. The percentage of survivors in the presence of NaCl was determined by determining the fraction of cfu resistant to NaCl relative to input cfu.

### IF localization of EnhC in L. pneumophila

The fixative was freshly prepared by mixing 0.2 μl of 25% gluteraldehyde to 100 μl of 16% paraformaldehyde on ice. Forty microlitres of 0.5 M NaH₂PO₄ was then added to the fixative prior to slow addition of 0.5 ml of post-exponential-phase *L. pneumophila* broth culture. Then the mixture was left at room temperature for at least 15 min without aeration before it was incubated on ice for at least 30 min. After the fixation step, the bacterial cells were washed three times with PBS. The bacterial cells were re-suspended in 0.5 ml of GTE buffer (50 mM glucose, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH = 8.0, 10 mM EDTA). The fixed bacteria were either spotted onto the coverslips immediately or stored at 4°C for up to 3 days prior to spotting on coverslips, using the following protocol.

As the fixation process was taking place, the coverslips (Fisher) were coated with 1 mg ml⁻¹ poly-L-lysine for 20–30 min at room temperature. Then the coverslips were washed with water three times. Twenty microlitres of fixed bacteria in GTE buffer were diluted in 400 μl of GTE buffer and added to the poly-L-lysine-coated coverslip. The bacteria were allowed to settle on the coverslip by 1000 r.p.m. centrifugation using Hermle Z 360 K model (National Labnet) for 5 min. Then the coverslips coated with the fixed bacteria were left at 37°C for at least 15 min before it was allowed to sit at room temperature for an additional 15 min. The coverslips were then washed three times with PBS before proceeding to IF staining or alternatively, the coverslips were stored in PBS at 4°C until probing. Before IF staining, fixed bacteria were permeabilized by 0.5 μg ml⁻¹ lysozyme in GTE buffer at room temperature for 5 min. EnhC in *L. pneumophila* was detected by rabbit anti-EnhC using a dilution of 1:500 and secondary anti-rabbit IgG-Texas red (Invitrogen) with dilution 1:500. Bacterial DNA was stained by DAPI to localize bacteria on the coverslips (Swanson and Isberg, 1996).

Image analysis was performed using IPLab Spectrum® software (BD Biosciences-Scanalytics). To generate the mean fluorescence intensity value (PIPP) for a bacterial population, the total pixel intensity for all bacterial images in a region of interest (ROI) of the picture was divided by the total number of the pixels for all bacterial images in the ROI. The distribution histogram showing bacterial counts at different signal intensity levels was performed by measuring the intensity (PIPP) of IF signal on every single bacterium for the bacterial population in the ROI. Based on these measurements, a histogram was generated by graphing the number of bacteria as a function of different intensities of IF signals on bacteria.

Supplementary materials

The following supplementary material is available for this article online:

Fig. S1. EnhC is required for enhanced resistance of *L. pneumophila* to NaCl. The lack of EnhC causes enhanced sensitivity to NaCl relative to the wild-type LP02 strain, with more than 10 times lower viability on CYET solid medium containing 0.65% NaCl relative to the wild type. The values shown on y-axis are negative, so the larger bars represent the lower values. LP03 (*dotA⁻*) served as a positive control for the strain resistant to NaCl (Experimental procedures). Student’s t-test analysis on LP02 and ΔenhC: *P* < 0.007. Strains used are described in Table 1. Mean ± standard deviation from triplicate samples are shown. Data represent typical experiment, repeated three times.
