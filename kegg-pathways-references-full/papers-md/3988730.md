Radioactive- and stable isotope-containing substrates were used to identify the biosynthetic precursors of the β-lactam antibiotic, thienamycin, in *Streptomyces cattleya*. Acetate is utilized by the organism to form C(6) and C(7) of the β-lactam ring. The two carbons of the hydroxyethyl group attached to C(6) are both derived from the methyl of methionine. The cysteaminyl side chain attached to C(2) is derived from cysteine. Selective inhibition of thienamycin and cephamycin C biosynthesis has been achieved either through the addition of metabolic inhibitors or through manipulation of the growth medium. These results suggest that the two β-lactam antibiotics, thienamycin and cephamycin C, are formed by different biosynthetic pathways.

one of the terminal steps in the biosynthetic pathway. In addition, it seems pertinent to note that wild type *S. cattleya* also produces northienamycin (7, Table I) which contains a single carbon side chain at C(6) instead of the two-carbon side chain found in thienamycin (21). Two reports have appeared on the production of carbapenams by a number of species of carbapenem-producing bacteria (19, 22). These 2,3-saturated compounds (e.g. 5, Table I) do not have antibacterial activity. However, compound 5 can be converted enzymatically to the corresponding carbapenem (19). Finally, it has been found that the OA-6129 family of carbapenems, which contain a C(2) pantetheinyl side chain (e.g. 10, Table I), are produced by a mutant strain of a *Streptomyces* sp. that lacks an acylase found in the parental strain and *S. cattleya*. This acylase catalyzes the hydrolysis of pantothenate from the C(2) pantetheinyl side chain of these compounds. It has been suggested that this route may represent the normal pathway of biosynthesis of the cysteaminyl side chain of thienamycin (22).

The penicillins, cephalosporins, and cephamycins are the β-lactam antibiotics whose biosynthesis has been the most well studied. A number of laboratories have demonstrated that all of these compounds are derived from a common precursor, δ-(ε-amino adipyl)-cysteinyl-valine, in both prokaryotic and eukaryotic producers of these antibiotics (23). The speculation has been advanced that there might exist a general biochemical mechanism for the formation of the β-lactam bond common to all antibiotics containing this structural grouping (24). Thienamycin, however, is distinguished from the penicillins and cephalosporins by three novel structural features (Fig. 1): 1) the sulfur atom of the molecule is adjacent to the bicyclic ring system rather than within it; 2) the β-lactam protons on carbons 5 and 6 have a trans relationship to one another; and 3) the side chain of the β-lactam ring does not contain an amide bond. Thus, on a structural basis, it is not clear which, if any, biosynthetic steps thienamycin might share with the penicillins and cephalosporins. Of the two known producers of thienamycin, only *S. cattleya* also synthesizes penicillin N and cephamycin C (4, 25).

Previous work in this laboratory has established that the pyrrolidine ring of thienamycin is derived from glutamic acid (26). We report here on the identification of the rest of the precursors used in the biosynthesis of thienamycin by *S. cattleya*. Based on these results and information in the literature, we propose a hypothetical scheme to account for the biosynthesis of the known carbapenems. In addition, we present data on the selective inhibition of thienamycin and cephamycin C synthesis in *S. cattleya* which suggest that the biosynthetic pathways for these β-lactam antibiotics are independent.

MATERIALS AND METHODS ${ }^{3}$

RESULTS

Origin of the $\beta$-Lactam Carbons (C(6)—C(7))—Preliminary experiments with ${ }^{[14} \mathrm{C}]$ acetate indicated that acetate is efficiently incorporated into thienamycin by $S$. cattleya (26). Fig. 3 shows the ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-NMR spectrum of thienamycin produced by $S$. cattleya in the presence of [1-${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}]$ acetate. A strong signal at the spectral position of the $\beta$-lactam carbonyl is evident along with a lower amount of incorporation at C(5). Complementary results were obtained when thienamycin produced from [2-${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}]$ acetate was examined (Fig. 4). Considerable incorporation of ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ at C(6) and/or C(8) was evident along with a smaller amount of incorporation at C(1). The fact that C(5) showed a reduced intensity is explicable if most of the ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ is present at C(6) and not C(8). In that case, a large fraction of the C(5) signal normally present as a singlet would occur in a doublet due to C(5)-C(6) spin-spin splitting. A smaller fraction should be split whenever C(1) is present as ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ as well which will further contribute to diminution of the C(5) signal. The low signal/noise ratio of the spectrum, however, did not permit observation of the expected doublet for C(5).

The position of acetate incorporation in thienamycin was clarified by an analysis of the antibiotic produced by $S$. cattleya from [1,2-${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}]$- and [2-${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$ acetate (Fig. 5A). The specific radioactivity of the isolated thienamycin indicated an incorporation of 0.56 mol of acetate/mol of thienamycin. The ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-NMR spectrum clearly identifies the positions of incorporation to be predominantly C(6)-C(7). Lesser enrichment of the C(1)-C(5) signals is also observed. Characteristic doublet signals indicating the incorporation of intact acetate units appear in pairs bracketing the chemical shift positions of all these carbons with both C(6) and C(7) exhibiting a carbon-carbon splitting of 38.1 Hz while C(1) and C(5) showed separations of 35.0 and 35.1 Hz, respectively (Fig. 5B).

Origin of the Hydroxyethyl Side Chain of Thienamycin—The fact that $S$. cattleya also synthesizes northienamycin (7, Table I), which contains a single carbon C(6) side chain, suggested the possibility that the hydroxyethyl side chain of thienamycin might be formed by two single carbon transfers. Two compounds, formate and methionine, known to contribute to single carbon metabolism were therefore tested as precursors of thienamycin. The data presented in Table II show that ${ }^{[14} \mathrm{C}]$ formate is very poorly incorporated into thienamycin; subsequent experiments have shown that this is due, at least in part, to the presence of a large amount of formate dehydrogenase in $S$. cattleya. ${ }^{4}$ L-[methyl-${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$ Methionine is very efficiently utilized in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic.

In order to establish which of the carbons of thienamycin are derived from the methyl of methionine, an experiment similar to those of Table II was carried out with [methyl-${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}]$ methionine, and the purified thienamycin was examined by ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-NMR. The ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$-NMR spectrum of this material is shown in Fig. 6. A large amount of incorporation of ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ is seen at C(8) and C(9) with no evidence for incorporation at any other site. Incorporation at both positions is so high that $\sim 30 \%$ of the sample contains ${ }^{13} \mathrm{C}$ at both C(8) and C(9). As a result, spin-split doublets with coupling constants of 38.0 Hz centered about the usual singlets are observed. Relative intensities of the peaks indicate that the methyl of methionine is equally incorporated into C(8) and C(9).

An experiment similar to those already described was next done with a mixture of [methyl-${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}]$- and [methyl-${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$ methionine in order to determine if the hydrogens of the methyl groups are incorporated into thienamycin along with the carbon. The molar specific incorporation of ${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}$ into thienamycin purified from the double isotope reaction mixture was 1.03 or 0.52/carbon. The maximum theoretical value of the ${ }^{3} \mathrm{H}$ molar specific incorporation (complete retention of all possible hydrogens during the conversion to thienamycin) is: $0.52+\frac{1}{3}(0.52)=0.69$. The value obtained experimentally was 0.60 or 87% of the theoretical maximum.

Incorporation of [methyl-${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$ Methionine into Northienamycin—In order to establish northienamycin as a possible intermediate in thienamycin biosynthesis, an experiment was performed to show that [methyl-${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$ methionine is incorporated into northienamycin as well as thienamycin. Northienamycin copurifies with thienamycin through the first two steps of the purification procedure (21). Northienamycin is separated from thienamycin in the final purification step, chromatography on HP-20 resin (Fig. 7A). The northienamycin-rich fraction was not, however, chemically pure. It was therefore necessary to analyze the northienamycin-rich fraction by combined HPLC-flow scintillation counting to determine its specific radioactivity. These results are shown in Fig. 7, B and C. Purified thienamycin of known specific radioactivity was used to determine the efficiency of the flow scintillation counter. In this experiment, the specific radioactivity of northienamycin was calculated to be 46.6 $\mu \mathrm{Ci} / \mathrm{mmol}$; that of thienamycin, 86.5 $\mu \mathrm{Ci} / \mathrm{mmol}$. Thus, the ratio of incorporation of [methyl-${ }^{14} \mathrm{C}]$ methionine into northienamycin and thienamycin was found to be 0.54:1. This experiment was

Biosynthesis of Thienamycin

FIG. 5. ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectrum of thienamycin produced from [1,2-${}^{13}$C]acetate. Resting cells were prepared as described under "Materials and Methods." Incubation was carried out in 28 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27 °C for 23 h. Each flask contained (in a total volume of 40 ml): cells (0.6 g of dry cell weight), 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and sodium [1,2-${}^{13}$C]acetate (90 atom % ${}^{13}$C; with a trace amount of sodium [2-${}^{14}$C]acetate; 1.90 μCi/mmol; 6.9 mM). Half of the sodium acetate was added initially; the other half was added after 11 h of incubation. After incubation, the contents of the flasks were pooled. Thienamycin was isolated in 73% yield as described under "Materials and Methods," affording 4.4 mg of purified antibiotic with a specific radioactivity of 1.07 μCi/mmol. The ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectrum of thienamycin was determined as described under "Materials and Methods." The complete ${}^{13}$C-NMR spectrum of this material is shown in A. An expanded version of the same spectrum is shown in B.

repeated with another batch of cells and the ratio of the specific radioactivities of northienamycin to thienamycin found was 0.45:1. Therefore, northienamycin, which contains a hydroxymethyl side chain at C(6), has one-half the specific radioactivity of thienamycin when [methyl-${}^{14}$C]methionine is used as precursor.

Origin of the Cysteamyl Side Chain—Cysteine is the most obvious candidate for precursor of the cysteamyl side chain of thienamycin as cysteamine can be synthesized directly by α-decarboxylation of cysteine. As discussed in the Introduction, however, pantetheine has also been proposed as a precursor of this side chain. The data presented in Table III summarize the results of experiments in which resting cells of *S. cattleya* were incubated with either [${}^{14}$C]- or [${}^{35}$S]cystine or [${}^{35}$S]pantethine, the thienamycin made by the cells was purified, and its specific radioactivity was determined. Cystine is very efficiently incorporated into thienamycin; the molar specific incorporations observed in the experiments with either [U-${}^{14}$C]- or [${}^{35}$S]cysteine are >70% of the theoretical maximum. In contrast, [${}^{35}$S]pantethine is very poorly incorporated into the antibiotic even though the cells appear to be able to utilize the added pantethine to a limited extent. In addition, when [${}^{35}$S]cystine was fed to the cells in the presence of a 2-fold excess of nonradioactive pantethine, no diminution in the incorporation of [${}^{35}$S]cystine into thienamycin was observed. ${}^{4}$ As expected, [1-${}^{14}$C]cystine is not significantly incorporated into thienamycin because C(1) is released as CO₂ during conversion to cysteamine.

In order to determine that the radioactivity from [U-${}^{14}$C] cystine was incorporated specifically into the cysteamyl side

Incubation was carried out in 28 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27 °C for 21.5 h. Each flask contained (in a total volume of 40 ml): cells (0.6 g of dry cell weight), 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and L-[methyl-$^{13}$C] and L-[methyl-$^{14}$C]methionine (90 atom % $^{13}$C; 4.2 μCi/mmol; 0.7 mM). After incubation, the contents of the flasks were pooled. Thienamycin was isolated in 60% yield as described under "Materials and Methods" affording 4.2 mg of purified antibiotic with a specific radioactivity of 5.33 μCi/mmol. The $^{13}$C-NMR spectrum of thienamycin was determined as described under "Materials and Methods."

Precursors of the cysteamyl side chain of thienamycin

Resting cells were prepared as described under "Materials and Methods." Incubation (18–22 h) was carried out in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks (15–26 flasks/experiment) on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27 °C. Each flask contained (in a total volume of 40 ml): cells (0.6 g of dry cell weight), 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5, and disulfide precursors. Disulfide precursor was added in two equal portions; the first was added initially and the second after 6–8 h of incubation. The final concentrations and specific radioactivities (calculated on the basis of sulfhydryl equivalents) of the disulfides used were as follows: DL-[1-$^{14}$C]cystine (0.6 mM; 47.5 μCi/mmol); L-[U-$^{14}$C]cystine (0.6 mM; 21.1 μCi/mmol); L-[${}^{35}$S]cystine (0.6 mM; 39.5 μCi/mmol); [${}^{35}$S]cystamine (0.4 mM; 60.7 μCi/mmol); and [${}^{35}$S] pantethine (0.7 mM; 15.8 μCi/mmol). After incubation, the contents of the flasks were pooled, and the cells were removed by centrifugation. Thienamycin was purified from the supernatant solution as described under "Materials and Methods," and its specific radioactivity was determined. Molar specific incorporation is the specific radioactivity of the purified thienamycin divided by the specific radioactivity of the precursor used.

chain, the purified [$^{14}$C]thienamycin from this experiment was oxidized with performic acid according to the procedure of Moore (30). This treatment results in the conversion of the cysteamyl side chain of thienamycin to taurine (1). After performic acid oxidation and workup, 83% of the radioactivity initially present as thienamycin was recovered. This radioactive material was identified as taurine by thin layer chromatography on silica gel plates in the following solvent systems (31): 1-butanol/acetic acid/H₂O (2:1:1, by volume), $R_F = 0.24$; chloroform/methanol/17% NH₄OH (2:2:1, by volume), $R_F = 0.76$; methyl ethyl ketone/pyridine/H₂O/acetic acid (70:15:15:2, by volume), $R_F = 0.043$. In all cases, 100% of the radioactivity migrated with o-phthalaldehyde-positive material that had an $R_F$ identical to that of authentic taurine.

Cysteamine itself could be an intermediate in thienamycin synthesis if decarboxylation of cysteine precedes addition to the antibiotic nucleus. As the data in Table III show, however, [${}^{35}$S]cystine is incorporated into thienamycin about 10 times more efficiently than [${}^{35}$S]cystamine. This result is not due to the inability of S. cattleya to take up and reduce cystamine to cysteamine. S. cattleya contains enzymes capable of reducing a number of disulfide compounds to their sulfhydryl forms. When incubated with cystamine, S. cattleya excretes cysteamine.⁴

One of the minor carbapenems produced by S. cattleya is N-acetyldehydrothienamycin (4, Table I) which contains a double bond in the cysteamyl side chain as well as an N-acetyl group. In order to determine if the cysteamyl side chain of thienamycin is unsaturated at any time during its biosynthesis, an experiment was performed in which resting cells of S. cattleya were incubated with a mixture of [3,3′-${}^{3}$H]- and [${}^{35}$S]cystine (for procedure, see the legend to Table III and “Materials and Methods”). The thienamycin synthesized under these conditions contained the same ${}^{3}$H/${}^{14}$C ratio as the input substrate.

Inhibition of Thienamycin and Cephamycin C Synthesis—In order to probe the relationship between thienamycin and cephamycin C biosynthesis in S. cattleya, the experiments summarized in Table IV were carried out. It can be seen that Co²⁺ is essential for thienamycin synthesis but not for cephamycin C synthesis. The requirement for Co²⁺ can be partially replaced by vitamin B₁₂ if the vitamin is added during the

growth phase of the cells.⁴ Thiaiso leucine, the sulfur analog of isoleucine (32), also inhibits thienamycin synthesis but not cephamycin C synthesis. This inhibition cannot be reversed by isoleucine even when isoleucine is added at 10 times the concentration of thiaiso leucine.⁴ On the other hand, amino hydroxycaproic acid, an analog of lysine which interferes with the production of cephamycin C in *Nocardia lactamdurans* by blocking the conversion of lysine to α-aminoadipic acid (33),⁵ inhibits cephamycin C synthesis but not thienamycin synthesis. Finally both methionine, which is a precursor of thienamycin and cephamycin C (Ref. 23 and present work), and cycloleucine, which inhibits AdoMet synthetase (34), inhibit the production of both antibiotics by *S. cattleya*.

The effect of methionine and the methionine analogs norleucine and ethionine on the synthesis of thienamycin and northienamycin by resting cells of *S. cattleya* was also analyzed. These data are shown in Fig. 8. In unsupplemented resting cells, northienamycin represents about 6% of the total carbapenem synthesized. Methionine and its analogs, norleucine and ethionine, all produced about ~90% inhibition of total carbapenem synthesis at high concentration (2 mg/ml). These compounds, however, appeared to have different effects if thienamycin and northienamycin were analyzed separately. Both methionine and norleucine stimulated northienamycin synthesis at low concentrations (<0.5 mg/ml). Addition of increasing amounts of methionine appeared to channel what carbapenem synthesis remained into northienamycin. Thus, at the highest concentration of methionine added, the proportion of total carbapenem present as northienamycin had increased from 6 to 32%. Norleucine, on the other hand, gave coordinate inhibition of northienamycin and thienamycin synthesis at increased concentration. Ethionine gave a third pattern of inhibition; thienamycin and northienamycin syntheses were both inhibited at all concentrations tested. In fact, the addition of ethionine appeared to decrease the proportion of total carbapenem represented by northienamycin.

**DISCUSSION**

The studies reported here on incorporation of \[^{13}C\]acetate establish that C(6) and C(7) of the β-lactam ring of thienamycin are derived from acetate. The incorporation of an acetate unit at C(1)-C(5) is also consistent with the previously reported identification of glutamate as the precursor of the pyrroline ring (26). A single turn of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with \[1,2-\^{13}C\]acetate as substrate will ultimately yield \[4,5-\^{13}C\]glutamate in which C(5) of glutamate is derived from C(1) of acetate.

The results on incorporation of \[methyl-\^{13}C\]methionine clearly establish that both carbons of the hydroxyethyl side chain are derived from methionine. The quantitative incorporation of radioactivity from \[methyl-\^{3}H\]methionine suggests that all of the hydrogens attached to C(8) and C(9) also come from methionine. This formation of an ethyl group from two methyl groups is unusual but not unique. For example, it was shown several years ago that the C(24) ethyl group of certain plant sterols is synthesized from the methyl of methionine (35, 36). More recently, Rinehart and his colleagues (37, 38) have demonstrated that both carbons and all of the hydrogens of the hydroxyethyl group of pactamycin come from the methyl of methionine. Incorporation of radioactivity from \[methyl-\^{14}C\]methionine into northienamycin suggests that methionine is also the precursor of the hydroxymethyl group of northienamycin.

The efficient incorporation of cystine into the cysteaminy

side chain of thienamycin, coupled with both the lack of incorporation of pantethine and the inability of pantethine to reduce the incorporation of cystine, supports a direct role for cysteine in the formation of the cysteaminy side chain in *S. cattleya*, rather than pantetheine as has been suggested (22). The fact that cystamine is not itself a precursor of thienamycin suggests that decarboxylation of cysteine occurs after its addition to the antibiotic nucleus. Finally, the results of the experiment with \[^{3}H\]- and \[^{35}S\]cystine show that the cysteaminy side chain is not unsaturated during its synthesis and thus rule out a dehydrothienamycin species (4, Table I) as a precursor of thienamycin.

On the basis of precursor data alone it seems likely that the biosynthetic pathways for thienamycin and cephamycin C are independent. In actinomycetes, lysine, valine, methionine, cysteine, and carbamylphosphate are used to form cephamycin C (23, 39).⁵ Thus, although thienamycin and cephamycin C share two precursors in common, cysteine and methionine, these compounds form completely different portions of the carbon skeletons of the two antibiotics (23). Moreover, selective inhibition of thienamycin and cephamycin C synthesis has been achieved either through the use of inhibitors or through manipulation of the growth medium. Thienamycin synthesis alone can be substantially reduced either by elimination of Co²⁺ from the growth medium or by addition of thiaiso leucine. It seems likely that Co²⁺ is required for vitamin B₁₂ biosynthesis and that this coenzyme participates in the biosynthetic pathway. The mode of inhibition of thiaiso leucine is unknown. Cephamycin C synthesis alone can be inhibited by the addition of aminohydroxycaproic acid, an analog of lysine. This compound interferes with cephamycin C synthesis in *N. lactamdurans*, the organism used for commercial production of cephamycin C, by blocking the production of α-aminoadipic acid from lysine, a step at the very beginning of the biosynthetic pathway (33).⁵ These results clearly show that thienamycin is not derived from some intermediate in the penicillin-cephamycin C biosynthetic pathway. They do not, however, rule out the possibility that the two pathways share some enzyme in common.

Inhibition of thienamycin and cephamycin C synthesis by cycloleucine, an inhibitor of AdoMet synthetase (34), suggests that AdoMet is the actual precursor of thienamycin as has been demonstrated for cephamycin C in cell-free extracts (40). Interestingly, methionine itself is an inhibitor of the synthesis of both antibiotics by *S. cattleya* even though it is required as a precursor. Thus, it appears that methionine acts to limit in some fashion the amount of AdoMet that is available for antibiotic synthesis. Methionine is known to be a repressor of the formation of AdoMet synthetase in *Escherichia coli* (41). Its analogs, norleucine and ethionine, are, however, neither repressors nor substrates for *E. coli* AdoMet synthetase (40–42). There is as yet no direct experimental evidence to suggest that such a regulatory mechanism operates in *S. cattleya*. However, stimulation of northienamycin synthesis by the addition of small amounts of methionine and norleucine could be explained if these compounds act to limit the supply of AdoMet; since northienamycin synthesis requires only one methyl group, it should accumulate under conditions of AdoMet limitation. The effect of ethionine on thienamycin and northienamycin synthesis could be explained if ethionine is a poor substrate for *S. cattleya* AdoMet synthetase; S-adenosylethionine might substitute for AdoMet in the thienamycin biosynthetic pathway and allow limited synthesis of thienamycin but not northienamycin. Consistent with this hypothesis is the observation that radioactivity from \[ethyl-\^{14}C\]ethionine is incorporated by *S. cattleya* into thien-

amycin at a low level, but the positions of incorporation have not been identified.⁴

Fig. 9 shows a hypothetical scheme for carbapenem biosynthesis which is based partly on the present studies and partly on data from the literature. The initial reaction is postulated to involve the condensation of acetyl-S-CoA with (presumably enzyme-bound) γ-glutamylphosphate (43) or some other γ-activated form of glutamate to yield a compound which would be likely to cyclize spontaneously to yield I. Tautomerization of I followed by ring closure, driven by the hydrolysis of the thioester bond, would yield carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylic acid, the simplest carbapenem. Alternatively, I could be used to start the β-lactam side chain as the hydrogens of the methylene group adjacent to both the carboxyl carbon of the thioester and the imine should be quite acidic. Since the PS-series carbapenems have been reported to have the opposite stereochemistry to that of thienamycin at C(6) (10), methyl addition to I has been shown without any designation of chirality. Ring closure of 2 then would give the 6-methyl derivative of carbapenem carboxylic acid, 3. Since no naturally occurring carbapenem has yet been reported that has the C(6) side chain without the cysteaminyl side chain, it seems reasonable to postulate the addition of cysteine across the double bond of 3 at this point. Alternatively, the sulfhydryl compound used could be pantetheine in which case, with further transformations, the OA-6129 series of carbapenems would result. Decarboxylation of the cysteinyl side chain of 4 would yield 5, with the completed cysteaminyl side chain. It is now necessary to postulate a mechanism for the C-methylation reactions which result in the synthesis of the hydroxyethyl side chain of thienamycin and the isopropyl side chains of the asparenomycins and the PS-series carbapenems. The transfer of a methyl group from methionine to an unsaturated carbon was first postulated and shown experimentally by Birch et al. (44, 45), and there is evidence in other systems that this type of reaction does occur (46). Oxidation of 5 at C(8) would give the methylidene derivative, 6. This compound could be converted to northienamycin in a series of steps. Thus, in this view of the pathway, northienamycin is a shunt product rather than an intermediate in thienamycin biosynthesis. Addition of another methyl group to 6 at the expense of AdoMet would give the ethylidene derivative, 7. In the producers of carbapenems with an isopropyl side chain, an additional methyl group could be added to 7 to give the isopropylidene derivative, 8. A series of steps would be required to convert 8 either to the asparenomycins or the PS-series carbapenems. In the thienamycin and epithienamycin pathway, 7 would be reduced to give 9. Introduction of a 2,3 double bond into 9 would give NS-5, a compound known to be produced by a mutant strain of *S. cattleya* (see Introduction). Hydroxylation at C(8) would yield thienamycin. The introduction of this hydroxyl group is not absolutely stereospecific since *S. cattleya* also produces 8-epithienamycin in small amounts (21). Alternatively, hydroxylation and oxidation could be carried out in reverse order yielding 2,3-dihydrothienamycin as an intermediate. This compound, in its N-acetylated form, is known to be made by an epithienamycin producer (see Introduction). Among the predictions to be derived from this scheme are the following: (a) all of the carbons in the isopropyl side chains of the asparenomycins and the PS-series carbapenems should be derived from the methyl of methionine, and (b) the hydroxyl group on C(8) of thienamycin should come from O₂. These predictions are experimentally testable.

### Materials and Methods

#### Materials

The strain of S. cattleya used in these studies was MA5617, a derivative of MA4297 (NRRL 8057), the original soil isolate (3). Thienamycin and imipenem (N-formimidoylthienamycin; MK-787) are products of Merck Sharp and Dohme Research Laboratories. Chromatographic media were obtained from the following sources: Dowex AG1X2 (50–100 mesh; chloride form) and Dowex AG50WX2 (50–100 mesh; hydrogen form) from Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.; Diaion HP-20 from Mitsubishi Chemical Industries, Ltd.; and, cellulose and silica gel thin layer plates from Eastman Kodak Co. Dowex 1X2 (chloride form) was converted to the bicarbonate form by the procedure of Treiber et al. (27). O-Phthalaldehyde spray reagent, l-hydroxy-benzotriazole monohydrate, and N,N′dicyclohexyl-carbodiimide were from Pierce Chemical Co. Radiochemicals were obtained from the following sources:

- L-[U-¹⁴C]cystine (318 mCi/mmol), L-[methyl-¹⁴C]methionine (57.5 mCi/mmol),

Ingredients for the culture media were obtained from the following sources: corn gluten meal and corn steep liquor from Corn Products Co.; solulac from Grain Processing Corp.; ardamine YEP from Yeast Products Co.; proflo from Trader's Protein Division, Fort Worth, Texas; Polyethyleneglycol-2000 from Dow Chemical Co.; isoleucine, MES, and MOPS from Sigma Chemical Co.; and, monosodium glutamate monohydrate from Fisher Scientific. DL-Thiaiso-leucine, cysteine, calcium pantothenate, DL-ethionine, L-methionine, cystine, cycloleucine, and L-norleucine were obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. Pantethine was obtained from Calbiochem. DL-α-amino-γ-hydroxycaproic acid was prepared by Dr. William H. Jones of MSDRL from 5-(4-hydroxybutyl)hydantoin (obtained from Eastman Kodak) according to the procedure of Gaudry (28). Sodium acetate, sodium formate, and hydroxylamine hydrochloride were obtained from Fisher Scientific.

#### Culture Media

The complex seed medium contained (per liter): sucrose (30.0 g), solulac (15.0 g), ardamine YEP (5.0 g) and corn gluten meal (5.0 g). The pH was adjusted to 7.5 by the addition of NaOH prior to sterilization. The semi-synthetic seed medium contained (per liter): monosodium glutamate monohydrate (5.0 g), NH₄Cl (1.5 g), K₂HPO₄ (2.0 g), inositol (0.4 g), NaCl (0.5 g), MgSO₄·7H₂O (0.5 g), FeSO₄·7H₂O (0.025 g), ZnSO₄·7H₂O (0.01 g), p-aminobenzoic acid (0.1 mg), CoCl₂·6H₂O (0.01 g), ardamine YEP (10.0 g), glycerol (10.0 g) and CaCO₃ (0.25 g).

The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NaOH prior to sterilization. The complex production medium contained (per liter): glycerol (30.0 g), glycine (1.3 g), corn steep liquor (25.0 g), solulac (10.0 g), proflo (5.0 g), CoCl₂·6H₂O (0.01 g), Polyethyleneglycol-2000 (1.25 ml), and MOPS buffer (10.5 g)

The pH was adjusted to 6.8 by the addition of NaOH prior to sterilization. Two types of synthetic production media were used. The first, synthetic medium A, contained (per liter): monosodium glutamate monohydrate (3.75 g), L-isoleucine (2.4 g), NH₄Cl (0.75 g), K₂HPO₄ (1.0 g), CoCl₂·6H₂O (0.01 g), MgSO₄·7H₂O (0.5 g), FeSO₄·7H₂O (0.025 g), glycerol (10.0 g), and MES buffer (14.6 g). The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NaOH prior to sterilization. Synthetic medium B contained (per liter): monosodium glutamate monohydrate (5.0 g), NH₄Cl (0.75 g), K₂HPO₄ (2.0 g), NaCl (0.5 g), MgSO₄·7H₂O (0.5 g), FeSO₄·7H₂O (0.025 g), CaCO₃ (0.25 g), CoCl₂·6H₂O (0.01 g) and glycerol (10.0 g). The pH was adjusted to 7.0 by the addition of NaOH prior to sterilization.

#### Preparation of Resting Cells

Seed cultures were first grown in complex seed medium (40 ml medium in 250 ml, three-baffle flasks) on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27°C for 24 hrs. The culture grown in complex seed medium was used to inoculate semi-synthetic seed medium (40 ml medium in 250 ml, three-baffle flask). The second stage seed culture was incubated as previously described and used to inoculate synthetic production medium A (20 ml medium in 250 ml erlenmeyer flask). The production cultures were grown under the same conditions as the seed cultures for 48–72 hrs. The cells were isolated by centrifugation and washed three times with either 50 mM sodium MES buffer or 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5. The volume of buffer used for each wash was equivalent to the initial volume of the culture. Phosphate buffer was used when the thienamycin synthesized by the cells was to be purified. For other types of experiments MES buffer was used. The washed cells were resuspended in the appropriate buffer in one-fourth of their original volume (~24–30 mg dry cell weight/ml). The cell suspension was stored at 4°C until use. The cells can be stored up to 36 hrs without any loss of synthetic activity.

When the fermentation was carried out in complex production medium (e.g., experiments described in Table IV), the procedure for the growth of the cultures was the same as described for preparation of resting cells except that complex seed medium was used for the development of both stages of the seed cultures and complex production medium was substituted for synthetic production medium.

#### HPLC Methods

Thienamycin: A Varian Model 5000 Liquid Chromatograph equipped with a Vista 401 Automatic Data Station was used. Conditions for chromatography were as follows: C reverse phase column, MCH-10 (300 X 4 mm; Varian); mobile phase, 10 mM KH₂PO₄; injection volume, 10 μl; column temperature, 38°C; flow rate, 2.0 ml/min; detection by absorbance at 297 nm. When analysis of the radiochemical purity of the product was done, a Flo-One liquid scintillation flow counter (Model HS; Radiomatic Instruments) was used in series with the spectrophotometer. The flow rate was reduced to 0.8 ml/min and the injection volume was increased to 50 μl. The scintillant was either Flo-Scint III (Radiomatic Instruments) or Scintiverse I (Fisher Scientific). HPLC conditions for the determination of northienamycin were the same as described for thienamycin except that an injection volume of 50 μl and a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min were used.

### Cephamycin C¹: Conditions for chromatography were as follows: column, Lichrosorb reverse phase (C₁₈; 10 μm; 300 x 4.6 mm; E. Merck); mobile phase, 1 mM 1-decanesulfonic acid sodium salt in 13 mM H₃PO₄, pH 2.5/methanol (79:21); injection volume, 10 μl; column temperature, 25°C; detection by absorbance at 254 nm.

### Purification of Thienamycin

Thienamycin was purified by the method of Treiber et al. (27) which involves chromatography on Dowex 1X2 (bicarbonate form; column size, 2.5 X 30 cm), Dowex 1X2 (chloride form; column size 1.5 X 24 cm), and Diaion HP-20 resin (column size, 1.4 X 46 cm). CO₂-Saturated water, used to elute thienamycin from Dowex 1X2 (bicarbonate form), was formed by placing dry ice pellets in distilled water. The purification of thienamycin was monitored by HPLC. Between chromatographic steps, the partially purified thienamycin was concentrated by rotary evaporation. After chromatography on HP-20, purified thienamycin was lyophilized and stored at -70°C until analyzed by C-NMR. In experiments with radioactive compounds, chromatography on Dowex 1X2 (chloride form) was eliminated from the purification procedure and a long column (1.5 x 115 cm) of HP-20 used. This modified purification procedure gave thienamycin of >95% radiochemical purity (e.g., Fig. 7C).

### Determination of ¹³C-NMR Spectra of Thienamycin

A Varian XL-100A spectrometer with broad band proton decoupling was used at 25.2 MHz. A typical analysis used thienamycin (~3 mg) in 2 mM phosphate buffer/D₂O (3 ml) at pH 6.8–7.0. The sample was held at ~5°C during overnight accumulations of the spectrum. Long-term accumulations were used in order to visualize as many of the ¹³C-signals as possible. The spectra were referenced to internal dioxane at δ = 67.4 ppm. Fig. 2 shows the natural abundance ¹³C-NMR spectrum of thienamycin. Two instances of close signal spacing complicate the interpretation of C-incorporation. The aminomethylene carbon (8) of the cysteaminyl side chain falls within 0.5 ppm of C(1). This presents no difficulty for low level incorporation at C(1) but creates interference in the spectrum of the sample produced from [1,2-¹³C]-acetate (see Fig. 5). A severe case of overlap occurs for C(6) and C(8), such that these two carbon signals may be unresolved. Careful observations reveal a small shift between C(6) and C(8) of somewhat less than 0.1 ppm and a single frequency, off-resonance decoupling experiment, coupled with the knowledge of the proton chemical shifts of thienamycin, allowed assignment of C(6) (65.9 ppm) at slightly lower field than C(8) (65.8 ppm). The signal from the carboxyl group of thienamycin was not observed in these studies; spectra of imipenem have yielded a chemical shift for this group of 169.1 ppm.

The C-chemical shifts for C(7) (180.3 ppm) and the carboxyl group (169.1 ppm) of thienamycin have been reassigned since the original publication of the structure of thienamycin (1).

#### Miscellaneous Methods

[³⁵S]Pantethine was synthesized from calcium pantothenate and [³⁵S]-cysteamine as described (29). The concentration of pantethine was determined by measurement of the absorbance at 245 nm (ε = 287 M⁻¹). Radioactivity was determined with a Packard Tri-Carb Liquid Scintillation Spectrometer. Scintiverse I (Fisher Scientific) was the scintillant used. The concentration of the thienamycin standard used to calibrate the integrator of the HPLC was determined by the hydroxylamine extinction method (3). Thienamycin was dissolved in 100 mM sodium MOPS buffer, pH 7.0. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride was added to a final concentration of 4 mM; a control to which water was added in place of hydroxylamine was also included. After 25 min. at room temperature, the absorbance at 297 nm of both samples was determined. The concentration of thienamycin was calculated from the difference in the absorbance of the control and the sample treated with hydroxylamine, and the extinction coefficient of thienamycin (9,583 M⁻¹). The same procedure was used to determine the sensitivity of an unknown to treatment with hydroxylamine except that the hydroxylamine hydrochloride was neutralized with sodium hydroxide before use. Dry cell weight was determined by drying a portion (10 ml) of the cell suspension for 16 hrs at 50°C under vacuum.

**Notes:**
a) Studies carried out in synthetic production medium A.
b) Seed medium also had Co²⁺ removed.
c) Studies carried out in complex production medium.

Additions of the analogs at the concentrations indicated were made at the time of inoculation of the production medium. The production flasks (20 ml medium/250 ml Erlenmeyer flask) were incubated on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27°C for four days. The cells were then removed by centrifugation and the supernatant solutions analyzed by HPLC for thienamycin and cephamycin C as described under Methods. The growth of the cells was not affected under any of the conditions tested. The compositions of the production media used are given under Methods. The control for each experiment contained CoCl₂ and no analog.

**Notes:**
a) Percent of total radioactivity recovered in the supernatant solution after incubation.
b) Mean ± S.D. (5 experiments).

Resting cells were prepared as described under Methods. Incubation (20-23.5 h) was carried out in 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks (15-28 flasks/experiment) on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27°C. Each flask contained (in a total volume of 40 ml): cells (0.6 g dry cell weight), 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6.5 and either sodium [¹⁴C]formate (41.6 μCi/mmol; 5 mM; pH 6.4) or L-[methyl-¹⁴C]methionine (79.5 μCi/mmol; 0.7 mM). Sodium formate was added in four equal portions at 4 h intervals. Methionine was added in two equal portions, one initially and the second after 8 h of incubation. After incubation the contents of the flasks were pooled, and the cells were removed by centrifugation. Thienamycin was purified from the supernatant solution as described under Methods and its specific radioactivity determined. Molar specific incorporation is the ratio of the specific radioactivity of the purified thienamycin to the specific radioactivity of the precursor used.

### Figure 3 – ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Thienamycin Produced From [1-¹³C]Acetate

Semisynthetic seed medium was used to develop both stages of the seed culture (24 h/stage) as described under Methods. The second stage seed culture was used to inoculate synthetic production medium B (46 flasks; 40 ml medium/250 ml Erlenmeyer flask). The flasks containing production medium were incubated on a gyratory shaker at 220 rpm and 27°C for 40 h. After 40 h of incubation, a sterile solution containing sodium [1-¹³C]acetate (40 mg, 90 atom % ¹³C) was added to each of the flasks. Incubation was continued for 24 h after the addition of acetate. The contents of the flasks were combined to yield a solution containing 7.9 mg of thienamycin. Isolation (see Methods) afforded 3.5 mg of purified antibiotic. The ¹³C NMR spectrum of thienamycin was determined as described under Methods.

### Figure 4 – ¹³C-NMR Spectrum of Thienamycin Produced from [2-¹³C]Acetate

Resting cells were prepared as described under Methods. Incubation was carried out in culture tubes (250; 25 x 150 mm) on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27°C for 23 h. Each tube contained (in a total volume of 4.0 ml): cells (0.06 g dry cell weight), 20 mM sodium MES buffer, pH = 6.5, and sodium [2-¹³C]acetate (90 atom % ¹³C; 6.9 mM). Half of the sodium acetate was added initially; the other half was added after 11.5 h incubation. After incubation, the contents of the tubes were pooled. Thienamycin was isolated in 60% yield as described in Methods to give 3.5 mg of purified antibiotic. The ¹³C-NMR spectrum of thienamycin was determined as described under Methods.

Biosynthesis of Thienamycin

**Figure 7A, B&C - Incorporation of [Methyl-¹⁴C]Methionine Into Northienamycin and Thienamycin**

A) Chromatography on HP-20. *S. cattleya* was used to synthesize [¹⁴C]-thienamycin and northienamycin from L-[methyl-¹⁴C]methionine as described in the legend of Table II. The supernatant solution was purified on Dowex 1 (HCO₃⁻) as described under Methods. The concentrated solution from Dowex 1 (HCO₃⁻) was loaded onto a column (1.5 x 115 cm) of HP-20 equilibrated and eluted with H₂O. Fractions (12 ml) were collected and analyzed for absorbance at 297 nm (---•---) and radioactivity (---o---). Fractions (24–31) were pooled and concentrated by rotary evaporation to 2.5 ml; this pool (#1) contained northienamycin (NorTHM). Fractions (37–73) were pooled and concentrated by rotary evaporation to 115 ml; this pool (#2) contained thienamycin (THM) and 8-epithienamycin (8-epiTHM).

B) HPLC Analysis of Pool #1. HPLC conditions were as described under Methods. The conditions for flow scintillation counting were as follows: flow cell, 7.5 ml; flow rate of scintillant, 3 ml/min; program #25 (peak integration, C); efficiency of counting, 56.2%. There was a 1 min difference in retention time between the output of the flow counter and the spectrophotometer; the retention times of the radioactive peaks in the figure have been corrected for this difference. Background radioactivity (<25 cpm/peak) has been subtracted to simplify the appearance of the figure. The material injected was concentrated Pool #1; it contained (in 50 μl): northienamycin (3.7 µg) and thienamycin (0.4 µg) and 2,200 dpm C. If the sample was treated with hydroxylamine as described under Methods prior to analysis, no peaks of absorbance or radioactivity corresponding to either northienamycin or thienamycin were observed in the resulting chromatogram.

C) HPLC Analysis of Pool #2. Conditions for HPLC and flow counting were as in (B). The material injected was concentrated Pool #2; it contained (in 50 μl): thienamycin (1.6 µg) and 900 dpm C.

**Figure 8 - Effect of Methionine and Methionine Analogs on the Synthesis of Thienamycin and Northienamycin**  
Resting cells of *S. cattleya* were prepared as described under Methods. Incubations were carried out in culture tubes (25 x 150 mm) on a gyratory shaker (220 rpm; 5.1 cm throw) at 27°C for 24 h. Each tube contained (in a total volume of 4.0 ml): cells (0.06 g dry cell weight), 40 mM sodium MES buffer, pH 6.5 and methionine or methionine analog (0.05 – 2.0 mg/ml). In the experiment of Panel (A), the concentration of L-methionine was varied; in that of Panel (B), L-norleucine; in that of Panel (C), DL-ethionine. After incubation, the cells were removed by centrifugation and the supernatant solutions analyzed for thienamycin (THM; ---•---) and northienamycin (NorTHM; ---o---) by HPLC as described under Methods. When no addition was made (control), NorTHM made up 6% of the total carbapenem synthesized ([THM] + [NorTHM]) by the resting cells. The numbers in parentheses by the NorTHM data points are the percentage of the total carbapenem synthesized by the resting cells at that concentration of methionine or methionine analog represented by NorTHM and were calculated from the equation: [NorTHM]/([NorTHM] + [THM]) x 100. The lines for variation of total carbapenem synthesized ([THM] + [NorTHM]) as a function of the concentrations of methionine, norleucine, or ethionine added were approximately the same as those for [THM] and are omitted.
