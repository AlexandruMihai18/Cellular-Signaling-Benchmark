Ras and its GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) are among the crucial regulators of extracellular ligands. Information about these regulators has been elucidated during the course of studies in signal transduction over the last two decades. RasGAPs such as p120GAP and neurofibromin have been studied extensively for their roles as either “negative” regulators or effectors of Ras. Accumulating evidence suggests that these molecules are crucial regulators of extracellular stimuli that serve to maintain the homeostasis of cellular functions. This compendium highlights cellular functions of RasGAPs and their signaling characteristics from the viewpoint of homeostasis, including our recent finding of the phenotype of R-RasGAP mutant mice whose GAP activity is down-regulated.

### I. Introduction

Small guanine nucleotide-binding GTPases (small G proteins) comprise a superfamily (including Ras, Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran), and play roles as “molecular switches” in a vast variety of cellular processes including cell movement, cytoskeletal reorganization, vesicle trafficking, and intracellular and nucleocytoplasmic transport. They are commonly monomeric and allosteric proteins, regulated by guanine nucleotide triphosphate (GTP) and guanine nucleotide diphosphate (GDP) as in the case of the heterotrimeric G proteins. Only the GTP-forms of G proteins interact with effectors that trigger cellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli. They have intrinsic GTPase activity to convert from the GTP-form (active) to the GDP-form (inactive), constituting a cycle (Fig. 1). Among the regulators of this cycle, guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GRF; also referred to as guanine nucleotide releasing protein (GRP) or guanine nucleotide exchange factor GEF) and GTPase activating protein (GAP) are two major molecules (Fig. 1). GRFs release GDP from small G proteins, resulting in the formation of GTP-bound GTPase due to the much higher concentration of GTP than GDP in the cells. On the other hand, GAPs promote the intrinsic GTPase activity of the small G proteins, resulting in the conversion of Ras-GTP to Ras-GDP. Whereas four families of small G proteins (Rho, Rab, Arf, and Ran) and their GAPs have evolved in both plants and animals, only Ras and its GAP family members are missing in plants, which have their own specific RhoGAPs. Ras family members act as regulators between receptors at the plasma membrane and effectors in the cytosol, such as in epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor-mediated signaling, where the receptor-associated intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity plays an essential role in coupling reactions associated with the plasma membrane. The lack of Ras in plants is in accordance with the fact that plants lack tyrosine kinase receptors. Over the last two decades, comprehensive genome-wide and phylogenetic approaches undertaken in the course of studies on signal transduction have confirmed the position of the Ras-RasGAP signaling system as a regulator of extracellular ligands. As a consequence, the function of RasGAPs as either “negative” regulators or effectors of Ras has been established. Among RasGAPs, p120GAP and neurofibromin have been extensively studied. p120GAP was the first to be identified and neurofibromin is the product of the gene responsible for neurofibromatosis type I (NF1), or von Recklinghausen's disease. Accumulating evidence suggests that these molecules are crucial regulators of extracellular stimuli in the homeostasis of cellular functions. From this viewpoint, this compendium refers to the potential functions of RasGAPs and their signaling characteristics. We also survey the literature of RasGAP studies in the early

Dr Shintaro Iwashita received his PhD for studying of the mechanism of Salmonella phage infection. He has worked on plasma membrane-mediated signal transductions such as that of p60src and epidermal growth factor receptor in several institutes including the UCLA Molecular Biology Institute. He began studies on RasGAP at the Mitsubishi Kagaku Institute of Life Sciences in Tokyo. During the process of preparing monoclonal antibodies against a RasGAP, he found a novel type protein containing the endonuclease domain of a retrotransposon (called p97Bcnt after Bucentaur). Dr Iwashita moved to the Faculty of Pharmacy, Iwaki Meisei University (Iwaki, Japan) in 2007, as a professor of Biochemistry, and works on the relationship between cellular homeostasis and gene duplication.

has been asked for a long time and remains an open question even now. One of the major reasons for this question is the fact that a genetic approach to RasGAP homologs in yeast<sup>13</sup> and *Drosophila*<sup>14</sup> revealed their effective roles only as a “negative” regulator of Ras. Furthermore, later findings in the study of neurofibromin boosted the understanding of RasGAP as a mere “negative” regulator. Neurofibromin is a member of the RasGAP family and tumor cell lines derived from NF1 patients show reductions in cellular GAP activity and elevations in Ras-GTP *in vivo*.<sup>15</sup> The combination of the facts that NF1 is one of the most frequent human genetic diseases (a prevalence of 1:3000 worldwide) and that the Ras mutation is closely related to human cancer established a simple scenario in which a decrease in RasGAP followed by the activation of Ras results in tumorigenesis, thus suggesting RasGAP to be a mere “negative” regulator of Ras.

p120RasGAP is recruited to activated receptor tyrosine kinases via its N-terminal region that contains two SH2 domains and modulates Ras signaling to ensure proper regulation of the receptor signaling. Several growth factor receptors have intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity, and the ligand-induced autophosphorylation of these receptors triggers intracellular signaling cascades driven by the recruitment of SH2 domain-containing molecules.<sup>5</sup> These molecules associate with specific phosphorylated residues for each receptor via the SH2 domain. p120GAP is a typical example of these molecules, and others include protein-tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), and Src kinase. In addition, adaptor and docking proteins such as Dok-1, -2, Grb-2 and its associated protein, Gab1 (Grb2-associated binder-1), are also recruited to the vicinity of the activated receptors.<sup>16</sup> It should be noted that most of these molecules are simultaneously phosphorylated by the Src family of kinases during coupling reactions involving the receptor machinery. The interactions of these molecules with different parts of the receptor machinery commonly control the amplitude and timing of signaling downstream of receptor activation. For example, based on results in

Fig. 1 RasGAP in Ras cycle and cellular signaling cascades (Upper panel): Signaling systems responding to extracellular stimuli consist basically of a ligand (L), receptor (R), and effector (E). The regulatory reactions between the receptor and effector, or the so-called coupling reactions including interactions of adaptor proteins by tyrosine phosphorylation, provide an opportunity for interaction with intracellular events to maintain cellular homeostasis.<sup>5</sup> Ras-RasGAP is one such coupling reaction. (Lower panel): Ras is a guanine nucleotide-binding protein that is regulated mainly by two regulators, guanine nucleotide releasing factor (GRF; also called GEF) and GAP.<sup>1,2</sup> Ras-GTP binds several effectors including Raf and PI3K, to trigger several biochemical reactions.

stages, which is suggestive for future work in the field.

II. Progress in RasGAP studies and the role of p120GAP in receptor signaling

The identification of RasGAP is a hallmark in the study of signal transduction, because the existence of this “negative” regulator had been strongly expected based on voluminous experimental work on the small G proteins. One of the most highlighted facts among the huge amount of accumulated data is that amino-acid substitutions in Ras are closely linked to the development of human cancers. More than 90% of human pancreatic cancers are associated with this type of oncogenic mutations of K-ras.<sup>9</sup> Therefore, the resulted small intrinsic GTPase activity of oncogenic Ras was suggested to be responsible for malignant transformation. However, the intrinsic GTPase activity of normal Ras is also unexpectedly much lower as in the oncogenic form. Thus some molecules

myeloid cells derived from dok KO mice,¹⁷,¹⁸ an association between p120GAP and p62 (Dok-1) is suggested to be useful for fine-tuning the attenuation of the Ras-pathway. In EGF receptor-mediated signaling, SHP2 dephosphorylates Gab1 tyrosine binding sites on both p120GAP and PI3K, and disengages p120GAP from the plasma membrane only where it interacts with Ras.¹⁶ This signaling cascade leads to the sustained activation of Ras. In the platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) β receptor,¹⁹ phosphorylated p120GAP binds to Src to prevent tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ1, thereby reducing the catalytic efficiency of PLC-γ1. Experiments following a genetic approach demonstrated a strong interaction between RasGAP and PLC-γ in Drosophila.²⁰ p120GAP binds to p190RhoGAP and this complex leads to the translocation of p190 from the cytosol to the plasma membrane, where p190 inhibits Rho activity.²¹,²² A complex of p120GAP, p190, and focal adhesion kinase is also formed and recruited to the cytoskeleton during integrin-mediated cell-substrate interaction.²³ All these interactions are linked to the association/dissociation of GAPs with/from the plasma membrane only where target Ras-GTP or Rho-GTP hydrolysis is stimulated.

(FLR) region, and an α7/variable loop.²⁴ An arginine situated in the finger loop, called the arginine finger, is essential for the transition state of GTP hydrolysis.²⁴ A defect in the finger loop of R-RasGAP mutant mice is embryonically lethal as described below.²⁵ It is noteworthy to point out a distinct difference in the GRDs of p120GAP and neurofibromin; neurofibromin has much higher affinity,²⁶,²⁷ but less stringent requirements,²⁶ for interaction with the H-Ras effector loop than p120GAP.

The following is a summary of the biological functions of RasGAPs with an emphasis on the regulation of homeostasis of cellular functions.

p120GAP

p120GAP contains SH, PH and C2 domains in addition to the GRD (Fig. 2), and is expressed ubiquitously. p120GAP is proposed to be a product of the gene responsible for a disease associated with variable phenotypes including capillary and arteriovenous malformations.²⁸ Mice with defects targeted at this gene are embryonic lethal²⁹ and their fibroblasts (p120GAP⁻/⁻) show no activation of Akt or anti-apoptotic activity in response to mild stress.³⁰ p120GAP plays a role in cell polarization rather than cell motility through a constitutive association with p190RhoGAP.³¹ Whereas p120GAP is a regulator of ligand-activated receptor signaling as described above, it may also contribute to precise intracellular events such as the progression of mitosis by controlling several binding proteins in a Ras-dependent fashion. G3BP (RasGAP Src homology 3 binding protein), a protein that binds p120GAP via its SH3 domain, is a heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein, and functions as a phosphorylation-dependent endoribonuclease.³² Interactions between p120GAP and less phosphorylated G3BP can be detected in the particulate fraction of dividing cells, but not that of quiescent cells.³³ Furthermore, arsenite-induced oxidative stress causes the dephosphorylation of G3BP, which facilitates the assembly of stress granules in which mRNA is stored in an abortive translation initiation complex.³⁴ The SH3 domain of p120GAP also binds two Aurora family members, homologues of prototypic yeast IPII and *Drosophila* aurora serine/threonine kinase.³⁵ Their kinase activities are highest in the G₂/M transition of the cell cycle progression, and p120GAP binds to the kinase domain, resulting in the inhibition of kinase activity. Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis, 68 kDa) is an RNA-binding protein and a member of the KH (the pre-mRNA-binding K protein homology) family.³⁶ p120GAP associates with Sam68 during the G₂/M transition in both normal and src-transformed cells,³⁷ and the association might be stronger in cells infected with an enterovirus.³⁸ Sam68 is a functional homologue of Rev, a protein in HIV that functions as an adaptor between the viral RNA and export machinery.³⁹ The complex of Sam68, p120GAP, PLCγ, and PI3K exists in mature T cells.⁴⁰

In cardiac myocytes, p120GAP was proposed to associate directly with Akt,⁴¹ one of the major kinases relevant to the apoptotic pathway. The N-terminal region of p120GAP, but not its C-terminal region, is required for the association to activate Akt in response to serum. The cleavage of p120GAP was first found during screening for signaling molecules involved in the turn-off process for anti-apoptotic signals.⁴² Widmann and co-workers revealed that the N-terminal fragment of p120GAP functions as a sensor of caspase activity, and that the cleavage of p120GAP contributes to anti-apoptosis under mild stress conditions.³⁰ This phenomenon was also found in human lung cancer cell lines, and examined from the viewpoint of cancer therapy.⁴³ p120GAP is also cleaved in GRD in the late stage of virus infection by a virus-derived protease(s) rather than a cellular caspase(s), resulting in Ras-MAPK activation, probably

III. The biological functions of RasGAPs

GRDs, domains responsible for GAP activity, were compared between p120GAP and neurofibromin. The GRDs of all RasGAPs comprise of three prominent regions: an arginine-finger loop, a phenylalanine-leucine-arginine

for both virus replication and virus-
mediated changes in host cells.⁴⁴ It is
noteworthy that p100GAP, an isoform
produced by alternative splicing with
deletion of the N-terminal Gly-Ala-Pro-
rich stretch of p120GAP (Fig. 2), exists
in the placenta at an exceptionally high
level (~0.1% of the total protein con-
tent), up to 10 times more abundant than
p120GAP.⁴⁵ The splicing of p100GAP
occurs only in primates, and its encoded
protein is expressed strongly in placental
trophoblasts, but not in other adult tis-
sues.⁴⁶ p100GAP is also expressed in
human leukemia cells during the process
of myelomonocytic differentiation in-
duced by PKC activator.⁴⁷ There is an
inverse correlation between the expres-
sion levels of both p100GAP and
p120GAP and trophoblastic tumorigen-
esis.⁴⁸ But the details of the function of
p100GAP remain to be resolved.

Neurofibromin

The NF1 gene product, neurofibromin, is
a RasGAP, whereas the gene responsible
for neurofibromatosis type 2 encodes
merlin, structurally unrelated to GAP,
which mediates the contact inhibition of
proliferating cells.⁴⁹ NF1KO mice are
embryonic lethal.⁵⁰ The degradation of
neurofibromin is rapidly triggered by
various growth factors via the ubiqui-
tin-proteasome pathway, and its protein
level is restored rapidly.⁵¹ These data
suggest that neurofibromin plays roles
as an intracellular sensor/mediator
against extracellular stimuli. Recently,
Drosophila neurofibromin has been
shown to regulate longevity and stress
resistance through adenylate cyclase but
not a Ras-dependent pathway.⁵² The
GAP activity of neurofibromin is de-
creased by the PKA (cAMP-dependent
kinase)-dependent binding of 14-3-3,⁵³ a
highly conserved member of a family of
regulatory proteins involved in intracel-
lular signal transduction. The expression
of the NF1 gene is strictly regulated by
transcription factors that have been iden-
tified as tumor suppressors or related
components for self-defense, such as in-
terferon consensus sequence-binding
proteins.⁵⁴ These facts are consistent
with the observation that NF1 gene ex-
pression is induced by injury (wound
healing), PDGF, and transforming
growth factor-β in cell cultures.⁵⁵

GAP1 family

The GAP1 family comprises four mem-
bers as described below, and has a com-
mon domain architecture of two tandem
C2 domains, GRD, a PH domain and
the adjacent Bruton's tyrosine kinase
(Btk) motif (Fig. 2).⁵⁶

GAP1m. GAP1m was identified and
named after a mammalian homologue
of Drosophila Gap1, and is expressed
ubiquitously.⁵⁷ It is notable that there is
a direct interaction between GAP1m and
the heterotrimeric G protein Gα12 via
the PH/Btk region.⁵⁸

R-RasGAP (GAP1IP4BP). Among
GAP1 family members, R-RasGAP is
characteristic in that it is constitutively
membrane-associated via a distinct PH
domain,⁵⁹ and involved in the continu-
ous regulation of extracellular stimuli. It
is preferentially expressed in the brain
and spleen²⁵ and has a stronger GAP
activity against R-Ras than H-Ras.⁶⁰
Because R-Ras is an activator of integ-
rins, cell-surface receptors for cell adhe-
sion and/or the extracellular matrix,⁶¹ it
is intriguing to examine the function of
R-RasGAP in the cell architecture. An
R-RasGAP mutation that results in the
lack of the arginine finger loop respon-
sible for GAP catalytic activity is embry-
onically lethal in homozygous mice,
whereas heterozygous mice are normal.²⁵
Impaired R-RasGAP may lead to the
constitutive activation of R-Ras, prob-
ably causing an imbalance in the signal-
ing pathways between R-Ras and H-Ras
in the blood barrier⁶² as shown in Fig. 3.
In fact, R-RasGAP mutant mice show
underdeveloped adherens junctions be-
tween capillary endothelial cells.²⁵

RASAL and CAPRI. Two Ca²⁺-de-
pendent RasGAPs, RASAL and CA-
PRI, are members of the GAP1 family
and commonly stimulate GTP hydrolysis
of Ras-GTP only during their associa-
tion with the plasma membrane, mainly
via their C2 domain, but their expression
and inhibition patterns are distinctly dif-
ferent.⁶³ RASAL is highly expressed in
the follicular cells of the thyroid and the
adrenal medulla.⁶⁴ It senses receptor-
mediated repetitive Ca²⁺ spikes and
shuttles between the cytoplasm and pla-
ma membrane during Ca²⁺ oscillation.⁶⁵
Thus, RASAL regulates Ras activity in

an off-and-on fashion throughout the
process. On the other hand, CAPRI is
preferentially expressed in the spleen and
lymph node,⁶⁶ and stays longer on the
plasma membrane without oscillation.⁶³
This difference is due to its distinct PH
domain,⁶⁵ which associates with phos-
phoinositides produced by extracellular
stimuli. ΔCAPRI, a spliced variant of
CAPRI that lacks one exon containing
an FLR-motif in GRD, plays a signifi-
cant role in osteoclastogenesis working
in a dominant negative fashion.⁶⁷
CAPRI also functions as an adaptor
for Cdc42 and Rac1, but not GAP
activity toward Ras, during FcR-
mediated phagocytosis, and CAPRI-
deficient mice have an impaired innate
immune response to bacterial infection.⁶⁶

SynGAP

SynGAP was identified as a neuron-spe-
cific RasGAP in the postsynaptic density
fraction (PSD)⁶⁸ or a scaffold PSD-95-
associated protein.⁶⁹ Homozygous mu-
tant mice lacking SynGAP die within
the first several days after birth.⁷⁰ Syn-
GAP is phosphorylated by Ca²⁺/calmo-
dulin-dependent protein kinase II, which
increases its GAP activity.⁷¹ SynGAP
forms a complex with Rab5 (a small
GTPase) indirectly via Unc51.1 (a ser-
ine/threonine kinase) and Syntenin
(a PDZ domain-containing scaffolding
protein).⁷² SynGAP has GAP activity
toward Rab5 in addition to H-Ras, and
the overexpression of SynGAP inhibits
the neurite outgrowth of cerebellar gran-
ule cells, which is rescued by Rab5
co-expression.⁷² Therefore SynGAP
may play a role in the Rab5-mediated
endocytic pathway in developing axons.
Analysis of conditional mutant mice has
demonstrated that a reduction in Syn-
GAP induces neuronal apoptosis.⁷³ In
this experiment, a gradual decrease in
SynGAP rescues mice from postnatal
lethality, but induces apoptosis of an
abnormally high number of neurons in
the hippocampus and cerebral cortex.
The effect is cell autonomous, occurring
only in neuronal types from which the
SynGAP gene is eliminated.⁷³

DIP1/2 (AIP1)

DIP1/2 (AIP1) was identified as a pro-
tein that interacts with the tumor sup-
pressor DOC/DAB2⁷⁴ or the apoptosis

Fig. 3 Schematic representation of the vascular endothelial barrier of R-Ras gap mutant mice with knocked-down RasGAP activity (hypothesis). We generated mutant mice lacking two exons of R-Ras gap²⁵ including the arginine finger loop, an essential domain for R-RasGAP activity.²⁴ Homozygous mice die at E12.5–E13.5 of massive subcutaneous and intraparenchymal bleeding, probably due to underdeveloped adherens junctions between capillary endothelial cells.²⁵ R-Ras activation by oxidized phospholipids enhances the interaction between monocytes and endothelial cells, whereas H-Ras activation inhibits the interaction.⁶² This interaction may facilitate the transmigration of monocytes across endothelial cells, which differentiate to macrophages migrating toward the site of inflammation⁹⁸,⁹⁹ (A). In R-Ras gap mutant mice, R-Ras may be constitutively activated, which would probably cause an imbalance between R-Ras and H-Ras activation. Massive hemorrhaging seems to be closely related to the fact that the vascular endothelial barrier of the mutant mice may not endure the increased blood pressure when cardiac ventricular pressure increases significantly in mouse embryos around E12.5²⁵ (C). No significant changes in phenotype were observed in either wild or heterozygous mice²⁵ (B). Endothelial cells at steady state (grey square boxes) and in an activated state (grey ovals) are represented. Black and open circles denote monocytes and red blood cells, respectively. Arrows indicate leakiness of blood components; the open oval denotes a differentiated macrophage.

signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) in tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated JNK/p38 MAPK pathways.⁷⁵ The protein has a domain architecture similar to that of SynGAP with two additional regions of proline repeats and a leucine zipper in the C-terminal region. TNF induces the serine phosphorylation of DIP1/2 at the 14-3-3-binding site, which is critical for the activation of ASK1-JNK/p38 apoptotic signaling.⁷⁶ Interactions between DIP1/2 and DOC/DAB2 are detected in normal tissue, but the altered expression of these proteins is often detected in prostate and breast cancer, due to decreased expression of the DIP1/2 gene.⁷⁴ The exposure of organisms to inflammation or virus infection often forces cells to follow the course of necrosis or apoptosis. Therefore, studies on the role of DIP1/2 in such situations will contribute greatly to the understanding of cellular homeostasis under various stresses.

IV. Signal transduction networks for homeostasis and a “negative” regulator

One of the goals of signal transduction research is to clarify not only signaling pathways, but also how their connections regulate the overall input-output balance for maintaining cell homeostasis, including the basal activation levels of signaling constituents. On this point, feedback regulation of activated signaling pathway(s) is a fundamental mechanism. Findings of regulators of heterotrimeric G protein signaling (RGS),³ GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins, in the G-protein-coupling receptor (GPCR) system have led to the discovery of signaling networks. These molecules involved in the feedback process have been identified as “negative” regulators but they regulate the corresponding signaling precisely,⁷⁷ not only acting as negative regulators. The results of signaling research will certainly be applied in clinical areas more frequently in the future than at present. In the case of tumor cells, their specific homeostasis is governed by highly diverse quantitative and/or qualitative changes in signaling molecules: for example, the overexpression of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors⁷⁹ and the constitutive activation of Akt.⁸⁰ The brain tumor astrocytes induced by the loss of neurofibromin show K-Ras- and PI3K-dependent hyperactivation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway.⁸¹ The cells are highly sensitive to rapamycin and show increased protein synthesis of nucleolar ribosome components (e.g. nucleophosmin) relevant to the promotion of cell growth.⁸² Therefore, these astrocytes with a defect in neurofibromin may survive by changing the pattern of basal energy metabolism. Nfl-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts respond to subthreshold levels of extracellular stimuli to induce biochemical reactions,⁵¹ reflecting one aspect of the functionally null cells for maintaining homeostasis. This lowering of the threshold is caused by a general up-regulation of basal levels of signaling pathways. For example, the RhoA signaling pathway is up-regulated in the human myometrium during pregnancy.⁸³ This is probably driven together with lysosphosphatidic acid (LPA) produced by the gradually increasing lysophospholipase D in the body fluid.⁸⁴ LPA is well known to induce a variety of cell functions through GPCR and in co-operation with Ras, Rho, and Rac.⁸⁵ It is intriguing that up to 50% of neurofibromas under follow-up examination enlarge, and that as many as 60% of new neurofibromas

appear during pregnancy. 86 Schwann membrane via annexin A6, a Ca²⁺-regulated and membrane targeting protein. 88 The formation of a constitutive complex of p120GAP with annexin A6 in the cytoplasm, and the formation of a Ca²⁺-dependent complex with Ras and PKC on the plasma membrane have been proposed. 88 The phorbol ester, a PKC activator, dependent down-regulation of RasGAP activity leading to Ras activation has been reported in several cells. 89 The interpretation of Ras activation due to down-regulation of p120GAP is mainly based on the results of the in vitro modulation of p120GAP and a dominant negative Ras, an inhibitor of GRF, which does not block Ras-dependent ERK activation. But this mechanism remains to be confirmed, because phorbol ester-mediated Ras activation was induced via another class of GRF stimulation. 89

In addition to the involvement of relatively short-term signaling of such as Ras activation via PKC-mediated down-regulation of p120GAP, p120GAP also plays critical roles in mitosis and virus-infected cells in a Ras-dependent manner as described above. It possesses anti-apoptosis activity, which is mediated by its partial N-terminal cleavage by caspase 3 under mild stress conditions. 30 Mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p120GAP show no anti-apoptosis activity in response to mild stress. This phenomenon is essential because the transient activation of caspase has been suggested to be critical in the process of terminal erythroid differentiation. 90 Another stress-responsive cellular process. The N-terminal region without GRD protects cells from apoptosis by activating Akt through the Ras/PI3K pathway, 30 and its mechanism of Ras activation remains to be resolved. In the neurite formation process, NGF-treatment of rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells decreases the amount of R-RasGAP, but not p120GAP. 25 In collaboration with NGF receptor tyrosine kinase signaling, the NGF-mediated downregulation of R-RasGAP may gradually lower the threshold of R-Ras and other related small G protein signaling pathways, and these series of changes may finally prepare cellular conditions to lower the threshold for neurite formation. In order for intracellular events such as mitosis and differentiation to proceed, cells need proper physiological conditions to maintain basal level activation by subthreshold stimuli. It has been proposed that EGF receptor transactivation by heterologous extra cellular agonists may contribute to the activation of Ras-GTP basal level in a variety of cells, including growth-arrested cells. 89 Of course, RasGAP should play an essential role in the homeostasis of cellular function for maintaining these basal levels.

V. Perspectives

It should be pointed out that a superfamily of RGS was identified in 1996, 3 and basic studies on G proteins were almost saturated by this time, nearly a decade after the identification of p120GAP in 1987. The discovery of RGS resolved a contradiction between the rapid signal transduction observed in the GPCR system in vivo and the slow rates of GTP hydrolysis of the Gα subunit in an in vitro reconstitution experiment. 3 The only possible explanation for such discrepancy is the identification of p120GAP as a required “negative” regulator for cellular homeostasis to inhibit active Ras, beyond the difficulty of understanding the function(s) of “negative” regulators in signaling systems. Once p120GAP and neurofibromin were identified as expected, it has not been easy to escape a simple concept of a “negative” regulator. This tendency has been caused by the strong impression made by the early discovery of functional roles for Ras and neurofibromin in carcinogenesis, and the later discovery of RGSs in relatively short-term signaling of the GPCR system. 3 However, it is now clear that a certain RGS plays a role distinct from that of a “negative” regulator in homeostasis of cellular function. For example, patients with a defect in RGS9, a GAP for transducin (a heterotrimeric G protein) in the phototransduction cascade, suffer transient blindness due to difficulty in adapting to changes in luminance. 77 One missense mutation in the RGS9 gene causes a substantial reduction in the GTP hydrolysis of transducin, resulting in a slow GTP-GDP cycle, which is responsible for the poor adaptation to the second light response. 77 Signal-ing systems such as coupling reactions in receptor machinery have been developed to form more refined regulatory
mechanisms in response to extracellular stimuli. From this viewpoint, RGS9 is a “proper” regulator, but not a “negative” regulator in phototransduction.

Comprehensive genomic and phylogenetic analysis<sup>4</sup> showed that in *Homo sapiens* the ratio of Ras families/RasGAP families is 3, whereas the ratio of Rho families/RhoGAP families is 0.3. Given the limited number of RhoGT-Pase and the estimated many RhoGAPs, it would be expected that the RhoGAPs may exhibit distinct specificities for various cell types, for example, the restricted expression of p73RhoGAP in vascular endothelial cells.<sup>91</sup> The data suggest that mammalian cells produce various signals, but with a relatively similar pattern on the plasma membrane in response to extracellular stimuli, and then strictly regulate each signal *via* cytoskeletal elements depending on cell type. Of course the critical point is not a simple number of signaling molecules, but the numbers of signaling networks as a system. It has been suggested that p120GAP also plays a role in particular endosomal compartments.<sup>92</sup> In mice with null mutation of H-ras<sup>93</sup> or N-ras gene,<sup>94</sup> both of which are non-lethal, total Ras (Pan Ras) protein levels are maintained as in wild-type mice, implicating a compensation mechanism to maintain total Ras levels through connections with highly strict network of distinct Ras family members. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the connections among signaling networks further, and obtain an understanding of the total picture. For this it is necessary to pay attention to the following points in further studies.

(1) In order to be free from the narrow view that GAPs are mere “negative” regulators, it should be understood that they can participate in the regulation of proper signaling from various aspects. It is true that RasGAP is a negative regulator in the Ras cycle; however, it may be a proper regulator in blood barrier homeostasis.<sup>25</sup> When using terms such as “positive” and “negative”, care should be taken to define clearly the range of signaling cascade, considering the time axis, to which these terms should be applied.

(2) It is noteworthy that p120GAP prevents the nucleotide exchange of an active form of H-Ras by GRF (GEF), suggesting a role in the protection of H-Ras-GTP against unproductive ex-

changes to prevent the Ras-GTP/GDP cycle from decay.<sup>95</sup> However, the specificity of GAPs toward target small G proteins seems not to be so strict when examined using their GRDs. For examples, p120GAP has stronger GAP activity toward R-Ras than H-Ras;<sup>27</sup> GAP1 family members have GAP activity for Rap in addition to a proper target Ras,<sup>59</sup> and p120GAP and SynGAP have a GAP activity toward Rab5 in addition to H-Ras.<sup>72,92</sup> Furthermore, it has recently been shown that K-Ras rather than H-Ras is a target molecule of neurofibromin.<sup>81,96</sup> Although it is difficult to evaluate the specificity of RasGAPs toward small G proteins, such knowledge is absolutely necessary for gaining an understanding of the connections between the small G protein cycles where each RasGAP is involved.

(3) To clarify the overall picture of signaling networks, genetic experimental systems such as *Drosophila* should be more heavily employed. A genetic approach is a powerful way to identify molecules in complicated signaling cascades, to examine cause-and-effect relationships, and to propose new potential functions. For example, the interaction between SHP2 and Gab1 in activated tyrosine kinase-associated receptors described above was found based on a genetic analysis of the Gab1 *Drosophila* homologue, Dos, as a substrate of the SHP2 homolog Csw.<sup>16</sup> Of course there are evolutionary differences between mammalian and *Drosophila* cells with respect to blood and other body fluids where various ligands function and evoke the response of Ras-GAP signaling. But species differences are not a mere demerit, but a hint for understanding the functional role of a signaling molecule, such as the SH domain-containing adaptor protein Crk.<sup>97</sup>
