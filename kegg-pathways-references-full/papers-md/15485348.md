■ **Abstract** Atherosclerosis, the primary cause of coronary artery disease (CAD) and stroke, is a disorder with multiple genetic and environmental contributions. Genetic-epidemiologic studies have identified a surprisingly long list of genetic and nongenetic risk factors for CAD. However, such studies indicate that family history is the most significant independent risk factor (15, 52, 77). Many Mendelian disorders associated with atherosclerosis, such as familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), have been characterized, but they explain only a small percentage of disease susceptibility (although a substantial fraction of early CAD). Most cases of myocardial infarction (MI) and stroke result from the interactions of multiple genetic and environmental factors, none of which can cause disease by itself. Successful discovery of these genetic factors will require using complementary approaches with animal models, large-scale human genetic studies, and functional experiments. This review emphasizes the common, complex forms of CAD.

## PATHOLOGY

Atherosclerosis is a progressive disease characterized by the accumulation of lipids and fibrous elements in the large arteries (Figure 1). The earliest lesions of atherosclerosis consist of subendothelial accumulations of cholesterol-engorged macrophages called foam cells. Such “fatty streak” lesions are not clinically significant, but they are the precursors of more advanced lesions characterized by the accumulation of lipid-rich necrotic debris and smooth muscle cells (SMCs). Such early atheromas typically have a “fibrous cap” consisting of SMCs and an extracellular matrix that encloses a lipid-rich necrotic core. Atheromatous plaques can become increasingly complex with calcification, ulceration at the luminal surface, and hemorrhage from small vessels that grow into the lesion from the media of the blood vessel wall. Although advanced lesions can grow sufficiently large to block blood flow, the most important clinical complication is an acute occlusion due to the formation of a thrombus or blood clot, resulting in a myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke. Usually, thrombosis is associated with rupture or erosion of a vulnerable plaque that has a thin fibrous cap.

Human pathological studies and experimental studies in animal models have elucidated the events of atherosclerosis. Mice deficient in apolipoprotein E (apoE) or the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor develop advanced atherosclerotic lesions and are the models most used in genetic studies. The first observable event is the accumulation of lipoprotein particles and their aggregates in the intima at sites of lesion predilection. Subsequently, monocytes and lymphocytes adhere to the surface of the endothelium and then transmigrate across the endothelial monolayer into the intima. The monocytes proliferate, differentiate into macrophages, and take up the lipoproteins, forming cholesterol-engorged “foam cells.” With time, the foam cells die, contributing their lipid-filled contents to a growing necrotic core. As lesions increase in size, smooth muscle cells migrate to the intima from the medial layer and secrete collagen to form a fibrous cap. Initially, such atheromatous lesions grow out toward the adventitia, but subsequently they encroach on the lumen. The lesions continue to grow by the migration of new mononuclear cells from the blood, which enter at the shoulder of the vessel, accompanied by the accumulation of extracellular lipid and fibrous elements. The factors involved in the development of advanced, complex lesions, frequently involving calcification and neovascularization, are less well understood. Of particular clinical relevance are the factors contributing to the development of “vulnerable” plaques that can rupture and trigger thrombosis.

## Cellular and Molecular Interactions

Figure 2A, B summarizes some molecular and cellular interactions important in early and late stages of atherosclerosis. The endothelium, with its intercellular tight junctional complexes, acts as a selectively permeable barrier between blood and tissues, and it can regulate thrombosis, inflammation, vascular tone, and vascular remodeling. Among the important physical forces acting on endothelial cells (ECs) is fluid shear stress, which affects EC morphology. Cells in regions of arterial branching or curvature, where flow is disturbed, show increased permeability to macromolecules such as LDL, and are preferential sites for lesion formation (Figure 2A).

A primary initiating event in atherosclerosis is LDL accumulation in the subendothelial matrix. Accumulation is greater when levels of circulating LDL are elevated, and both the transport and retention of LDL are increased in the preferred sites for lesion formation. LDL diffuses passively through EC junctions, and its retention in the vessel wall involves interactions between the LDL constituent apolipoprotein B (ApoB) and matrix proteoglycans. In addition to LDL, other ApoB-containing lipoproteins, namely lipoprotein(a) and remnants, can accumulate in the intima and promote atherosclerosis (Figure 2A).

The trapped LDL undergoes modification, including oxidation, lipolysis, proteolysis, and aggregation. Enzymes involved in such modification include 12, 15-lipoxygenase (15-LO), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), myeloperoxidase (MPO), and various lipases. One of the modifications most significant for early
lesion formation is lipid oxidation, resulting from exposure to the oxidative waste of vascular cells. Such modifications initially give rise to minimally oxidized LDL (mmLDL) species that have pro-inflammatory activity but may not be sufficiently modified to be recognized by macrophage scavenger receptors. Mice lacking 15-LO have considerably diminished atherosclerosis, which suggests that this enzyme may be an important source of reactive oxygen species in LDL oxidation (Figure 2A).

High-density lipoprotein (HDL) protects against atherosclerosis. An important mechanism underlying this protective effect is HDL’s role in removing excess cholesterol from peripheral tissues, but HDL also protects by inhibiting lipoprotein oxidation. The antioxidant properties of HDL are due in part to serum paraoxonase (PON1), an esterase carried on HDL that can degrade certain biologically active oxidized phospholipids. Platelet activating factor acetyl hydrolase (PAF-AH) and apolipoprotein A-I (Apo-A1) also have antioxidant properties (Figure 2A).

Atherosclerosis is characterized by its recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes to the artery wall. A triggering event for this process is the accumulation of minimally oxidized LDL, which stimulates the overlying ECs to produce numerous proinflammatory molecules, including adhesion molecules and growth factors such as the macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF). The biological activity of minimally oxidized LDL occurs primarily in its phospholipid fraction, and scientists have identified active oxidation products resulting from the scission or rearrangement of unsaturated fatty acids. In addition to oxidized LDL, many other factors likely modulate inflammation, including homocysteine levels, sex hormones, and infection. Diabetes may promote inflammation in part by forming advanced glycation endproducts (AGEs) that interact with endothelial receptors (Figure 2A).

Adhesion molecules and chemotactic factors mediate the entry of particular types of leukocytes into the artery wall. The firm adhesion of monocytes and T cells to endothelium can be mediated by the integrin VLA-4 on these cells, which interacts with VCAM-1 on the endothelium and the CS-1 splice variant of fibronectin. Other molecules important in adhesion and migration include E-selectin and P-selectin (monocytes) and CXCR3, IP-10, I-TAC, and Mig (lymphocytes). Mice deficient in monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1) or its receptor CCR2 have significantly reduced atherosclerotic lesions, which suggests that MCP-1/CCR2 interaction has a role in monocyte recruitment in atherosclerosis. A variety of chemokines induced by interferon gamma (IFNγ) may contribute to lymphocyte recruitment (Figure 2A).

The cytokine M-CSF stimulates the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of macrophages and influences various macrophage functions such as expression of scavenger receptors. Mice with a spontaneous null mutation of M-CSF have dramatically reduced lesions, which suggests an obligatory role for macrophages in lesion formation (67).

LDL must be extensively modified before it can be taken up sufficiently rapidly by macrophages to form foam cells. A group of receptors that recognize a wide
array of ligands mediates the rapid uptake of highly oxidized (and otherwise modified) LDL particles by macrophages, which leads to foam-cell formation. Two such “scavenger” receptors, SR-A and CD36, are of primary importance, and mice lacking either receptor show a modest reduction in atherosclerotic lesions. Secretion of cholesterol by macrophages, mediated by ABCA-1 and apolipoproteins such as apoE, may protect against atherosclerosis. Mice deficient in acyl-cholesterol acyl transferase (ACAT) cannot store cholesterol and have reduced lesions (Figure 2A).

The cholesterol-loaded macrophages undergo necrosis or apoptosis, donating their contents to a growing lipid-rich necrotic core. FAS and p53 partially mediate apoptosis (Figure 2A).

Fibrous plaques are characterized by a growing mass of extracellular lipid, mostly cholesterol and its ester, and by the accumulation of SMCs and SMC-derived extracellular matrix. Cytokines and growth factors secreted by macrophages and T cells are important for SMC migration and proliferation and extracellular matrix production. Recent studies show that the interaction of CD40 with its ligand CD40L (CD154) makes an important contribution to the development of advanced lesions. The engagement of CD40 and CD40L results in the production of inflammatory cytokines, matrix-degrading proteases, and adhesion molecules. Although studies with immunodeficient mice originally indicated that lymphocytes were not required for atherogenesis, it is now clear that lymphocytes play a modulating role. For example, antibodies to oxidized LDL (oxLDL) epitopes and heat shock protein (HSP) influence disease progression. Also, studies of T-lymphocyte products, such as IFN-$\gamma$, IL-4, IL-10, and IL-13, are consistent with an important influence in lesion development (Figure 2B).

Several risk factors contribute to the development of fibrous lesions, including elevated homocysteine, hypertension, and hormones. Elevated homocysteine injures ECs and stimulates proliferation of vascular SMC. Some effects of high blood pressure on atherosclerosis are mediated by components of the renin-angiotensin pathway. For example, angiotensin II directly stimulates SMC growth and extracellular matrix production. Studies with spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) indicate that raised blood pressure stimulates expression of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), a potent mitogen for SMCs. Estrogen has multiple anti-atherogenic properties, including effects on plasma lipoprotein levels and stimulation of prostacyclin and nitric oxide (NO) production (Figure 2B).

Pathological studies suggest that the development of thrombus-mediated acute coronary events depends principally on the composition and vulnerability of a plaque rather than the severity of stenosis. Vulnerable plaques generally have thin fibrous caps and increased numbers of inflammatory cells. Maintenance of the fibrous cap reflects matrix production and degradation, and products of inflammatory cells likely influence both processes. For example, T cells produce INF-$\gamma$, which inhibits the production of matrix by SMCs, and macrophages produce various proteases, particularly matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), that degrade extracellular matrix. Rupture frequently occurs at the lesion edges, which are rich in foam
cells, which suggests that factors contributing to inflammation may also influence thrombosis (Figure 2B).

The stability of atherosclerotic lesions may also be influenced by calcification and neovascularization, common features of advanced lesions. Intimal calcification is an active process in which pericyte-like cells secrete a matrix scaffold, which becomes calcified, akin to bone formation. Oxysterols and cytokines regulate the process (Figure 2B).

The thrombogenicity of the lesion core likely depends on the presence of a tissue factor, a key protein in the initiation of the coagulation cascade. Production of the tissue factor by ECs and macrophages is enhanced by oxidized LDL, infection, or ligation of CD40onECs to CD40L on inflammatory cells (Figure 2B).

## Etiology

In the past 50 years, epidemiological studies have revealed numerous risk factors for atherosclerosis (Table 1). These can be grouped into factors with an important genetic component and those that are largely environmental. The relative

abundance of the different plasma lipoproteins is particularly important because raised levels of atherogenic lipoproteins are a prerequisite for most forms of the disease.

Atherosclerosis is probably one of the most complex diseases. Although we know only a small fraction of the genes involved in CAD, we can estimate a lower limit of the total number of genes by considering the genetics of the known genetic risk factors for CAD (Table 1). With the exception of Lp(a) levels and gender, all involve multiple genetic factors and some, such as blood pressure, HDL levels, and total cholesterol levels, exhibit smooth population distributions characteristic of polygenic traits. Large genome scans for various risk factors, including diabetes, obesity, and hypertension, have failed to reveal loci accounting for a large fraction of the population variation, suggesting the involvement of many genes. Thus, hundreds of genes, at least, are involved in susceptibility to CAD. Supporting this conclusion are genetic studies of traits such as diabetes, body fat, plasma lipoprotein levels, blood pressure, and atherosclerotic lesions in mice and rats, which together suggest that at least dozens of loci contribute to each of these traits when considering various crosses (50, 102). Another level of complexity involves the interactions between risk factors. Frequently, these are not simply additive; for example, the effects of hypertension are considerably amplified if cholesterol levels are high.

Many family and twin studies (reviewed in 52, 60, 87) have examined the importance of genetics and environment in human CAD. Within a population, the heritability of atherosclerosis (the fraction of disease explained by genetics) has been high in most studies, frequently exceeding 50%. Table 1 lists heritability estimates and various risk factors for MI. Because the assumptions required for estimating heritability are not entirely correct, the calculated heritabilities must be considered approximate. In some cases, modeling the mode of inheritance has produced better estimates, but important assumptions remain. Heritability also depends on the age of the individuals under study (heritability is much higher for early MI), the ethnic groups studied, and the state of the environment. Another measure of the importance of genetics is the increased risk to a relative of an affected individual compared to the general population. Because CAD is so common after 55 years of age, such calculations are usually presented for “premature CAD.” For example, one study observed that the relative risk of CAD for women under 65 years and for men under 55 years was five- to sevenfold increased if they had a first-degree relative with premature CAD (88). Animal models of atherosclerosis also provide dramatic evidence for the importance of genetic contributions. For example, inbred strains of mice, each with a unique genetic background, differ widely in the development of atherosclerosis (2).

Population migration studies, on the other hand, show that the environment explains much of the variation in disease incidence between populations. For example, Japanese have a much lower incidence of CAD than Americans, but Japanese-Americans who have adopted a Western lifestyle have about the same incidence as other Americans (61). Also, the Seven Countries Study, which examined

plasma lipid levels and CAD in seven different populations, revealed striking differences that are not likely due to genetic differences (43). A dramatic example of a stationary population that has undergone an environment change are the Pima Indians of Arizona. Prior to adapting a Western lifestyle, these Indians had a modest incidence of obesity and diabetes, but now obesity and diabetes are rampant (62). From these and other studies, it appears that the difference in CAD incidence between populations is due primarily to environmental factors. However, this is not to say that populations do not differ in genetic susceptibility; for example, the Pima Indians have a surprisingly low incidence of CAD given the high frequency of diabetes.

## Mendelian Forms

Identification of the genes underlying Mendelian disorders that cause atherosclerosis or affect risk factors for the disease has provided important insights into the fundamental biology (Table 2). For example, studies of two rare genetic lipid disorders, Tangier disease and sitosterolemia, have revolutionized our understanding of sterol transport (8, 12, 75). In addition to enhancing our understanding of the biology of disease, the study of monogenic disorders can lead to successful drug therapies for common disease. For example, studies of FH have helped to unravel the molecular pathways that regulate cholesterol metabolism, knowledge which was important for developing cholesterol-lowering drugs (28). Mendelian diseases also provide a logical basis for candidate gene study for the more common forms of disease. Five of the six causative genes in maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY) are transcription factors, which likely have pleiotropic effects (57). Although it is unlikely that the severe mutations that underlie MODY are responsible for the more common forms of diabetes, less severe variations in these genes may predispose to insulin resistance. For example, a missense mutation in TCF1, the gene mutated in MODY3, is significantly associated with type 2 diabetes (33).

A recent study of a single large family with dominant inheritance of CAD and MI provides evidence for the involvement of MEF2A, a member of the myocyte enhancing factor-2 family. A rare mutation of the gene segregated with the disease in the family and MEF2A is strongly expressed in vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. The gene is not involved in several other families with familial CAD/MI (100).

## CAD and Myocardial Infarction

Whole-genome scans of families enriched for CAD have revealed several loci linked to CAD or MI (Table 3), but so far none of the underlying genes have been identified. Although the lod scores are significant, no replication of loci has been observed in the various studies. This could be due in part to the different populations tested and to the design of the studies. It is also possible, even likely,

that contains an allele for high levels of apoAII exhibited increased atherosclerosis. Subsequent transgenic studies with both mouse and human apoAII indicated that AII-rich HDL promotes atherogenesis (103). This might be due to the reduced antioxidant potential that apoAII-enriched HDL exhibits. These observations also extend to humans, in whom increased apoAII levels are associated with metabolic disorders. The second gene identified encodes 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), an enzyme involved in leukotriene production. It is a positional candidate in a cross between the strains CAST and B6, and its role in atherosclerosis was confirmed by examining lesion formation in 5-LO targeted mice (56). 5-LO is expressed in leukocytes and has been studied mainly in the context of acute inflammation. Presumably, it influences the functions of macrophages or lymphocytes. In subsequent studies of a human population, genetic variation in the 5-LO gene was associated with carotid intimal-medial thickness, a measure of atherosclerosis (21).

There have been hundreds of association studies for CAD and MI, but most have been underpowered and probably represent type 1 errors. A few have been convincingly confirmed (Table 5). Some large-scale association studies have been performed with many candidate genes. For example, a study of patients from the Cleveland Clinic Foundation examined 62 vascular biology candidate genes and observed significant associations with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of three unlinked genes, all members of the thrombospondin family (94). There has been some confirmatory evidence, but further functional and genetic studies are required. Also, Ozaki et al. (63) carried out a large case-control study of 92,788 SNPs and found two functional SNPs of the lymphotoxin A (LTA) gene that were associated with MI. LeBoeuf and colleagues (78) had previously studied the LTA gene in mice and found that a null mutation modestly influences lesion development.

## Stroke

Stroke has two main clinical phenotypes: ischemic stroke, responsible for 80% to 90% of events, and hemorrhagic stroke, responsible for the remainder. Ischemic stroke can be subdivided into forms due either to atherosclerosis of vessels in the brain or to a clot that travels from a diseased heart to occlude a cerebral artery. Atherosclerosis and hypertension are common denominators of all of these forms. Stroke, like MI, has a strong genetic component, as evidenced by family and twin studies and Mendelian forms (95).

Recently, the gene encoding phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) was implicated in ischemic stroke. Gretarsdottir et al. (29) mapped a stroke susceptibility locus to chromosome 5q21 using linkage analysis of pedigrees in Iceland, a genetic isolate. They then saturated the region with microsatellite and SNP markers to test for association. The strongest association was with PDE4D, and the authors provided some evidence that the associated polymorphisms exhibit altered regulation of PDE4D splice isoforms. Although quite convincing, it will be important to carry out functional studies of the gene in rodent models of stroke (19, 40).

## Lipoprotein Metabolism

The most significant risk factors for CAD and stroke are related to lipoprotein metabolism. Figure 3 presents an overview of lipoprotein metabolism. Lipids are transported through the circulation as complexes with proteins, termed lipoproteins. In general, lipoproteins consist of a core of hydrophobic lipids (triglycerides and cholesteryl esters) surrounded by a monolayer of amphipathic lipids (phospholipids and free cholesterol) and various apolipoproteins. Apolipoproteins function in the packaging and secretion of lipids from cells, in the processing of circulating
lipoproteins, and as ligands for cellular receptors. The plasma apolipoproteins include apo(a), AI, AII, AIV, AV, B48, B100, CI, CII, CIII, and E. Lipids can be transferred between lipoprotein particles by enzymes such as cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP).

Dietary lipids are packaged in intestinal mucosal cells and secreted into the lymph as large triglyceride-rich particles called chylomicrons. Cholesterol absorption is mediated in part by the ABCG5 and ABCG8 transporters. Upon entering the circulation, lipoprotein lipase (LPL) rapidly lipolyzes the chylomicrons, thereby delivering free fatty acids (FFAs) to tissues such as muscle and adipose. The LDL (apoB/E) receptor and the LDL receptor-related protein (LRP) mediate the rapid uptake of the resulting remnant particles by liver (Figure 3).

The liver actively synthesizes triglycerides and cholesterol, which, along with intestinally derived lipids, are packaged and secreted as very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs). Like chylomicrons, VLDL particles are large and triglyceride-rich, but they have a different metabolic fate. VLDLs undergo lipolysis in the circulation and give rise to intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDL). Hepatic receptors remove a significant fraction (about half) of IDLs from the circulation, and the remainder undergo further lipolysis by LPL and hepatic lipase (HL) to produce LDLs. LDLs have a long half-life in the circulation and, in most individuals, are the predominant cholesterol-carrying particles. The LDL (apoB/E) receptor, which is present in both liver and peripheral tissues, largely mediates the removal of LDL from the circulation (Figure 3).

HDLs are formed in the circulation from precursors secreted by liver and intestine, and from chylomicron and VLDL surface remnants. HDLs facilitate the removal of cholesterol from cells, a process mediated in part by ABCA1. The cholesterol is then esterified by lecithin cholesterol acyl transferase (LCAT) and transported to the liver, the only tissue capable of metabolizing and excreting excess cholesterol. The liver's uptake of HDL cholesterol is mediated partially by the scavenger receptor class BI (SR-BI). Hepatocytes can oxidize cholesterol to bile acids by a pathway involving cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (7-α-hydroxylase) (Figure 3).

Most common forms of hyperlipidemia or low HDL levels are due to a combination of multiple genetic and environmental factors. Many of the genes for apolipoproteins, lipoprotein receptors, and enzymes in plasma lipoprotein metabolism have been examined as “candidate” genes to test for possible associations or linkages with levels of plasma lipoproteins and lipids. Most of the observed effects on lipoprotein metabolism are small and require confirmation, although some associations are convincing (Table 5). For example, three common variations of apoE exhibit marked effects on plasma cholesterol levels and contribute to type III hyperlipidemia and, in Western populations, explain 4% or more of total plasma cholesterol levels (86). Also, in several population studies, polymorphisms of the hepatic lipase gene were associated with HDL levels (85).

Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCH) is the most common discrete hyperlipidemia (1% to 2% of European populations but also common in other populations) and is characterized by elevations of VLDL, IDL, and LDL.
Although it exhibits a vertical transmission pattern, resembling a dominant mode of inheritance, it is complex. Among survivors of premature MI (less than 60 years old), FCH is the most common familial lipid disorder, with a frequency of about 10% to 20%. The primary defect in FCH involves an increased production of apoB and VLDL. Population association and family linkage studies suggest that certain alleles of the apoAI-CIII-AIV-AV gene cluster contribute to elevated triglyceride levels (92), and this cluster is also associated with FCH (16). Heterozygosity for null mutations of LPL may also contribute to certain forms of FCH. None of the candidate genes studied thus far is likely the primary cause of FCH. Several genome scans for FCH have been reported and suggest that a major gene for FCH resides on human chromosome 1q21-22 (65). Recently, the upstream transcription factor 1 (USF1) gene on 1q21 was shown to be associated with FCH (64a). USF1 provides a promising candidate for FCH because it regulates several genes of glucose and lipid metabolism.

FH is a dominant Mendelian lipid disorder with a high frequency, about 1/500 in the U.S. population. Most forms are caused by mutations of the LDL receptor gene that affect receptor function. FH is extremely heterogeneous at the molecular level, and scientists have characterized dozens of mutations of the LDL receptor gene with variable effects on plasma cholesterol levels. Because of the heterogeneity of LDL receptor mutations, molecular diagnosis of the disorder is difficult. Certain founder populations, including French Canadians, Afrikaners, and Lebanese, exhibit a high frequency of specific mutations in each population (28).

Familial defective apoB 100 (FDB) is another common Mendelian hyperlipidemia (with a frequency of about 1 in 500–1000 in European populations). In most cases, it is due to a mutation in the coding sequence of apoB 100 that substitutes glutamine for arginine at amino acid 3500 of the polypeptide. This region serves as the ligand for binding to the LDL receptor, and the mutant form exhibits only a few percent of normal receptor binding activity. Heterozygous FDB individuals exhibit cholesterol levels of about 300 mg/dl due to defective LDL clearance (52).

Lipoprotein(a), or Lp(a), is a variant of LDL. Like LDL, it contains a cholesteryl-ester-rich core surrounded by a single molecule of apoB 100, but it contains an additional polypeptide, termed apo(a), that is disulfide-bridged to apoB. The levels of Lp(a) differ greatly among individuals, ranging from undetectable to about 200 mg/dl. Numerous epidemiologic studies indicate an association between high Lp(a) levels and CAD (7, 97). Analysis of Lp(a) levels using the sib-pair method indicates that more than 90% of the variance of Lp(a) levels is determined by multiple alleles of the apo(a) gene (9, 18).

## Metabolic Syndrome and Diabetes

Metabolic syndrome, also called the insulin resistance syndrome, is characterized by hyperinsulinemia, obesity, decreased HDL cholesterol levels, small dense LDL particles, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension, all of which contribute to an increased risk of heart disease (23, 36, 70). The strong clustering of insulin resistance,

hyperlipidemia, and hypertension in the metabolic syndrome suggests that there are common genetic factors for these traits, but genes that are specific to each component most likely exist as well. A subset of insulin-resistant individuals develop noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), characterized by insufficient insulin secretory capacity to maintain normal glucose levels. Hyperglycemia causes increased nonenzymatic glycation of proteins, resulting in the production of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and the formation of reactive oxygen species (54). Such AGEs may damage the artery wall, perhaps contributing to the accelerated atherosclerosis observed in diabetics. Among candidate genes that have shown significant associations to NIDDM or glucose and insulin levels are the insulin and insulin receptor genes, the glycogen synthase gene, the glucokinase gene, the b3-adrenergic receptor gene, and the PPARgamma gene (3). A genome scan in a Mexican-American population with a high rate of diabetes identified a major NIDDM susceptibility locus, designated NIDDM1, on chromosome 2q. Using linkage disequilibrium mapping, scientists showed that an intronic polymorphism in the calpain-10 gene was strongly associated with the disease (35). A second locus for diabetes was identified on chromosome 1q in the Pima Indians of Arizona (32), in three independent sets of Caucasian pedigrees from Utah, France, and the United Kingdom, and in an Amish study sample (22, 98, 104). It is interesting to note that the chromosome 1 locus was originally linked to the FCH phenotype in a set of Finnish families, and FCHL overlaps with diabetes (65). Obesity also exhibits considerable metabolic overlap with the abnormalities present in diabetes and is associated with hypertension. A variety of candidate genes have shown associations with various measures of obesity in human populations (47). These include the sodium-potassium-ATPase genes on chromosome 1, the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor on chromosome 10, the beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase gene on chromosome 1, and the brown adipose tissue-uncoupling protein gene on chromosome 4. Genetic studies in mutant mouse strains have led to the identification of several genes contributing to obesity (47, 90).

## Hypertension

Numerous studies have revealed associations between elevated blood pressure, hyperlipidemia, insulin resistance, and CAD (34). There has been substantial progress in elucidating the genetic basis for certain Mendelian forms of hypertension (Table 2), but the genetic factors contributing to common forms of hypertension are largely unknown. Numerous candidate genes, particularly members of the renin-angiotensin system, have been investigated in humans and animal models. Both linkage and association studies have provided strong evidence for the role of the angiotensinogen gene in hypertension in Caucasian and African-Caribbean populations as well as in pregnancy-induced hypertension (14). The angiotensin-converting enzyme gene is associated with coronary heart disease, but this appears to involve a mechanism independent of the effects on blood pressure (91). In addition to candidate gene studies, there have been several genome scans for essential hypertension and blood pressure in various populations (45, 46).

Homocysteine Levels

Total plasma homocysteine is an independent and significant risk factor for CAD. A common polymorphism in the methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene is the underlying cause of moderate hyperhomocysteinemia in about half the cases (41, 55). The most important known factor in determining whether the presence of the polymorphisms will result in elevated homocysteine levels is the intake and availability of folic acid. When plasma levels of folate are above 4 uM, homocysteine levels in individuals with the polymorphism are no different, on average, than those of unaffected individuals. At lower concentrations of folate, the likelihood of having high-basal homocysteine increases in all persons, but much more in individuals with the polymorphism (Figure 4).

![Figure 4](#)

Figure 4 Effect of methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) alleles and folate intake on homocysteine levels. Alleles 1 and 2 indicate the thermostable and thermolabile forms of MTHFR, respectively. Folate levels, separated according to tertile, are determined largely by dietary intake. Homocysteine is indicated by “Hcy.” (From 51.)

# Hemostatic Factors

Thrombosis triggered by atherosclerotic plaque rupture is the proximate cause of most morbidity and mortality associated with atherosclerotic vascular disease. Nonocclusive thrombosis with organization of the thrombus also contributes to plaque enlargement. Among studied blood hemostatic factors, plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and Factor VII (FVII) show significant independent associations with arterial vascular disease (30), and there is strong evidence that common polymorphisms in each gene contribute moderately to the overall interindividual variability in their levels. A common theme, shared with the thermolabile mutation of MTHFR affecting homocysteine levels, is that these polymorphisms influence the response to environmental factors (fibrinogen and smoking, PAI-1 and triglycerides, MTHFR and folate) (37, 93).

# Cellular Factors in Lesion Initiation and Progression

Because atherosclerosis involves an interaction of arterial cells with blood elements, genetic factors acting at the level of the artery wall or blood cells are likely to play an important role in genetic control of susceptibility to CAD and stroke. Evidence for the existence of such factors is based in part on the finding that the known risk factors do not fully account for the familial clustering of CAD (27, 59). A study bearing on this point showed that intimal thickening of coronary arteries in infants who had died prior to 1 year of age was significantly associated with a family history of CAD (42). Recently, mutations of the MEF2A gene were shown to contribute to a rare, dominant form of familial CAD/MI (100). Many candidate genes for processes such as cellular growth, inflammation, and oxidative stress have been identified, but the genetic complexity of atherosclerosis makes it difficult to test the role of these genes directly. The difficulty of quantitating lesions in humans presents a problem for human genetic studies, and the endpoints most often used, such as MI, are relatively crude. For these reasons, studies in animal models are particularly informative. Recent animal studies provide conclusive evidence that genetic variations in vascular cell functions can dramatically influence susceptibility to atherosclerosis (80, 81).

Vascular permeability is increased at anatomical sites of atherosclerosis predilection, and the composition of the intimal matrix can influence LDL binding and retention. These processes suggest various candidate genes that could be examined in genetic studies, such as matrix proteins, but no definitive reports have been published.

There is abundant evidence that oxidation within the vessel wall is central to at least the early stages of atherogenesis, and molecular studies and studies with transgenic mice have suggested various processes and candidate proteins that could contribute to lipoprotein oxidation (Figure 2). These include the levels of metal ions, thiols, superoxide, lipoxygenase, glucose, nitric oxide, myeloperoxidase, antioxidants, and HDL-associated enzymes protecting against oxidation. Polymorphisms of some genes likely to influence oxidative stress or lipoprotein

oxidation, including serum paraoxonase, nitric oxide synthase, and the hemachromatosis associated gene, are associated with CAD in population studies. The evidence that serum paraoxonase (PON1), a protein carried on HDL that inhibits the accumulation of oxidized lipids, plays an important role in genetic susceptibility to atherosclerosis is particularly convincing (reviewed in 83). Stimulated by observations that PON1 could inhibit the oxidation of LDL in vitro, many association studies of PON1 gene polymorphisms have been conducted. Two common missense polymorphisms, a leucine to methionine substitution at amino acid 55 and a glutamine to arginine substitution at amino acid 192, have been extensively studied. Currently, more than 50 PON1 associations studies have been conducted with many different populations, including many European groups, Japanese, Chinese, Asian Indians, and American Indians. As expected for a trait as complex as CAD, results differ between studies. However, taken together, the data are impressive because more than half of the studies yielded significant results, and studies involving the glutamine to arginine polymorphism, which affects the activity of the enzyme, consistently show that the arginine allele is associated with increased risk. Supporting the human data are studies in PON1 knockout and transgenic mice, which conclusively show that the enzyme can inhibit the development of atherosclerotic lesions (96).

In response to lipoprotein oxidation or other influences, monocytes are recruited to the artery wall. This involves the expression of adhesion molecules, chemotactic proteins, and growth factors for monocyte-macrophages (67). Among the many potential candidate genes that could contribute to vascular inflammation, several have been examined in human association studies. Results with some, including TGF-β1, interleukin-1 receptor antagonist, and 5-lipoxygenase, are at least suggestive. A key process in foam-cell formation is the uptake of oxidized lipoproteins, mediated by cell surface receptors, which recognize oxidatively modified LDL. Null mutations of CD36, an important receptor for uptake of oxidized lipoproteins, commonly occur in the Japanese population, and these may influence CAD (1).

Factors influencing vascular smooth muscle cell growth and death are likely contributing factors in atherosclerosis (5). Polymorphisms of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II and also degrades the vasodilator bradykinin, have been associated with plasma levels of ACE and CAD in several populations (13, 74). Angiotensin II promotes smooth muscle cell proliferation, whereas bradykinin is a growth inhibitor. One possible explanation for the proliferation of smooth muscle cells in atherogenesis is a nonmalignant transformation of the cells, resulting from mutations of genes involved in growth control. Benditt & Benditt (4) provided evidence for monoclonal proliferation, but recent studies indicate that this results from normal development (79).

Arterial calcification commonly occurs in advanced human atherosclerotic lesions, and such calcification may contribute to lesion rupture. Cell biology studies indicate that arterial calcification is an active process akin to bone formation, which suggests potential candidate genes. Studies with mice reveal the existence of
distinct genetic factors contributing to arterial calcification (68) and to myocardial cell calcification (38).

# Cellular Factors in Lesion Rupture and Thrombosis

Advanced lesions can grow sufficiently large to block the flow of blood, but most clinical symptoms are the consequence of rupture and thrombus formation, as Figure 1 depicts. It is likely that genetic factors, distinct from those contributing to lesion growth, influence rupture and thrombosis. In support of this, some linkage studies reveal distinct genetic loci contributing to a quantitative variation of CAD rather than MI. Advanced stable plaques are characterized by a thick fibrous cap consisting of smooth muscle cells and collagen, whereas unstable plaques have a thin fibrous cap and are rich in inflammatory cells and lipids (Figure 1). Potential mechanisms leading to vulnerable plaques were recently reviewed (24). The MMPs that contribute to extracellular matrix turnover are promising candidate genes. Many members of the family (MMP-1, -2, -3, -7, -8, -9, -12, -13, and -14) are expressed in atherosclerotic lesions, and the expression of MMP-1, -3, and -9 increases in vulnerable shoulder regions. The activities of the MMPs are counterbalanced by their natural tissue inhibitors (TIMPs). Consistent with this concept are studies showing that genetic or pharmacologic inhibition of certain MMPs can reduce aneurysms in animal models. The stability of the fibrous cap could also be influenced by matrix synthesis and by molecules that stabilize matrix, such as transglutaminase, which crosslinks collagen. Inhibiting a potential regulator of matrix turnover, transforming growth factor β, resulted in a more vulnerable plaque phenotype (53).

Other mechanisms that could contribute to plaque stability are cellular growth, apoptosis, and lipid metabolism in the vessel wall (5). Because SMC secretes the extracellular matrix, the growth and death of SMC could influence plaque stability. A large lipid core could also mechanically weaken the plaque. There is also evidence that polymorphisms of genes for some proteins involved in host defense (such as CD14) may influence plaque stability (84).

As discussed in the section on hemostasis, association studies show that levels of various proteins involved in hemostasis, such as fibrinogen, are associated with polymorphisms of genes encoding the proteins. In turn, epidemiologic studies have correlated the levels of some such proteins with CAD and MI. Thus, it appears that common variations of certain genes for hemostasis contribute to the genetic component in CAD. This correlation is likely due in part to thrombosis following plaque rupture.

# Common and Rare Variations

Two extreme models of allelic structure have been envisaged for common diseases such as CAD. One states that common alleles at numerous loci interact to cause disease. This is called the common variation/common disease (CV/CD) hypothesis. The second model explains that rare alleles at numerous loci cause the disease.
either single-handedly or together with other genetic or environmental contributions. This is called a genetic heterogeneity model (71, 89). Most likely, CAD involves a mix of the two models, but which model proves most correct will be significant for diagnosis and risk assessment. If many different alleles underlie genetic susceptibility (for example, as in the case of the breast cancer gene BRCA1), DNA-based testing may be prohibitively expensive. Currently, there are too few known genetic alterations underlying atherosclerosis and its risk factors to allow strong conclusions, but most of the variations identified thus far consist of a few relatively common alleles (Table 5).

If the alleles that cause CAD are mostly of ancient origin, there must be a reason that they have not been removed by natural selection. One plausible explanation is that late-onset forms of CAD reflect the accumulation of late-acting lethal alleles in the gene pool and are ignored by natural selection because of their limited impact on reproduction (most victims of CAD are past their reproductive years). Although this explanation sounds reasonable, death from early-onset forms of CAD is substantial. A second possible explanation deals with the proatherogenic environment of modern humans. If the alleles for CAD were lethal only when given an environment that did not previously exist, these alleles would not have been subjected to natural selection. Third, there may be some CAD-promoting alleles that are under positive selective pressure for unknown reasons (for example, some lipoproteins appear to play a role in host defense). Finally, if many different genes contribute to atherosclerosis susceptibility, as is likely, the negative selective pressure on each may be slight (51).

## Gene-Gene and Gene-Environment Interactions

Little is known of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions in CAD, but it would be surprising if they were not important (87). One striking example involves alleles of apolipoprotein E (ApoE) and type III hyperlipidemia. ApoE has three major alleles, with frequencies in the U.S. population of about 30% (E4), 60% (E3), and 10% (E2). In the population, the E2 allele is associated with significantly reduced cholesterol levels and the E4 allele with elevated cholesterol levels. Altogether these alleles explain about 4% of the genetic variance of cholesterol levels in the population. However, a subset of individuals homozygous for the E2 allele have a very severe hyperlipidemia termed type III (frequency 1 in several thousand). This is presumably the result of gene-gene interactions, although gene-environment interactions could be involved (60). Another example is the interaction of folate intake and MTHFR alleles in controlling homocysteine levels (Figure 4). This polymorphism provides a potential paradigm for genetic screening and risk assessment for CAD.

Berg distinguishes between “level genes,” which set the basal level of gene expression, and “variability genes,” which determine the change in gene expression in response to environmental change (6). He attempted to identify such genes by

examining pairs of identical twins exhibiting various alleles of candidate genes; for example, certain alleles of apoB correlated with a larger difference within twin pairs than other alleles, suggesting that certain alleles were more responsive to environmental factors. Unfortunately, no detailed follow-up studies have been reported, and the results are only suggestive at this point.

Both gene-gene and gene-environment interactions are best examined in animal models and there are many known examples in mice. The striking effect of genetic background on atherosclerosis in apoE null mice (e.g., Figure 1A) is a clear example of a gene-gene interaction (2). Also, although bone marrow transplantation of apoE null marrow into some strains of mice promotes atherogenesis, such transplantation inhibits atherogenesis in other strains (82). Presumably, apoE has anti-atherogenic effects (such as promoting cholesterol efflux from macrophages) as well as proatherogenic effects (such as increasing the binding of lipoproteins to intimal proteoglycans).

## Strategies to Identify Genes Underlying CAD

Presently, one can map a monogenic disease and identify the underlying gene if enough families are available. However, success in mapping genes for complex diseases, such as CAD, has been modest. The slow process of gene identification in complex traits is most likely caused by several factors, such as locus and allelic heterogeneity, epistasis, difficulties in assessing the complex phenotypes, unknown modes of inheritance, phenocopies, reduced penetrance, and a high frequency of disease-predisposing alleles.

Until recently, the genetic component of CAD was investigated either by candidate gene studies of known genes, mainly using case-control study samples, or genome-wide scans identifying novel chromosomal loci, mainly using families or affected sib-pairs. However, the Human Genome Project should increase our ability to map genes involved in complex traits, including CAD, by providing the basic tools for the analyses, i.e., the sequence of the human genome and millions of variants. Currently, the greatest challenge is to meaningfully analyze the enormous amount of data the Human Genome Project has produced, including millions of SNPs available for association tests. Association tests are much more powerful than linkage analysis for detecting alleles of complex traits with only modest effects (73). To aid in this process, novel approaches identifying the causal variants among those in an associated haplotype are currently under study (17, 26, 66, 71, 72, 105). These studies suggest that most of the human genome consists of blocks of variable length over which only a few common haplotypes are observed, punctuated by sites of recombination hot spots. In European populations, the mean size of blocks is 22 kb and ~80% of the genome in blocks >10 kb, whereas in African Americans, the mean size of blocks is 11 kb and ~60% of the genome in blocks >10 kb (26).

The HapMap project is currently building these haplotype blocks in the human genome. The project began in 2002 and is expected to take three years. The aim

is to clarify how the human genome is organized into haplotype blocks by analyzing the block patterns in blood samples taken from people in Japan, Nigeria, and China, as well as from people of northern and western European ancestry in the United States. The HapMap project is largely based on the theory of common variants underlying common disorders. The biggest advantage of this approach is that if common haplotypes capture most of the genetic variation across sizable regions, these common haplotypes (and the undiscovered variants they contain) can be tested with the use of a few tag SNPs (26), potentially providing a powerful shortcut to identifying genes for complex traits, including CAD. The study samples originating from different populations will likely provide at least partially different disease-associated allelic variants and their haplotypes with varying lengths of LD, which will help identify the actual causative variant(s). The haplotype-block strategy detects mostly high-frequency variants and is agnostic about the types and physical locations of SNPs that are functional. However, there are currently several open questions regarding the block theory. Most recent studies of large data sets indicate that some genomic regions fit better to the block theory than others, implying that the usefulness of this analysis method will be uneven and will depend on the specific patterns of LD in the region of interest (99). In most Mendelian single-gene disorders, the causative variants are coding variants (10). Therefore, a sequence-based approach focused on identifying and testing for association of SNPs in coding and regulatory regions has also been suggested for association testing (10).

# Genomics and CAD

DNA microarrays have the potential to relate gene expression to genetic variation, to subdivide complex phenotypes on the basis of distinct expression patterns, and to identify genes and pathways that contribute to disease.

In a recent study, Schadt et al. genetically linked changes in gene expression to specific chromosomal locations by utilizing gene expression as a quantitative trait in an F2 cross of two inbred mouse strains (76). Thousands of loci, termed expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs), were identified, providing candidate genes for complex traits segregating in the cross. Perhaps more important, the multiple genetic perturbations segregating in such crosses may allow identification of key pathways contributing to complex traits.

Gene expression data can also be used to subdivide complex traits that otherwise would be indistinguishable. In the study by Schadt and colleagues (76), mice were divided into groups with high- and low-fat pad mass. Analyzing the gene expression data for these two groups of mice revealed that not only did they exhibit different expression signatures, but also that the high-fat pad mass group could be subdivided into two groups with distinct expression signatures. Subsequent genetic analysis revealed that these two groups were under the control of different loci.

Although considerable information can be gained from expression studies in animals, expression studies in humans are difficult to analyze because relevant target tissues are often unavailable and sample sizes are too small to observe.
statistically significant expression differences between cases and controls. In a recent study of type 2 diabetic males, Mootha and colleagues (58) hypothesized that analysis of gene sets rather than individual genes would identify metabolic pathways that are altered in diabetic individuals. Gene sets were assigned based on prior knowledge of gene function in a pathway. Of 149 gene sets, a single set comprised of PGC-1alpha-responsive genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) was subtly, but consistently, downregulated (~20%) in the muscle of diabetic individuals (58).

Emerging expression studies in atherosclerosis are shedding light on the biological processes that contribute to its development. In a recent study, atherosclerotic plaques of patients with stable and unstable angina were examined for differential gene expression (69). Genes known to be involved in hemostasis, such as the protein S (PROS1) gene, the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 gene, the interleukin (IL)-7 gene, and the MCP-1 and -2 genes, were expressed at significantly lower levels in samples from unstable angina patients, suggesting that these factors may be important for plaque rupture and thrombosis. Another example comes from expression studies in peritoneal macrophages from atherosclerosis-resistant versus-susceptible strains of mice. Expression profiling revealed that HspA12A, a gene encoding a novel member of the heat shock protein (Hsp) 70 family, was expressed at higher levels in macrophages obtained from the resistant strain (31). Subsequent analysis revealed that both HspA12A and its closely related homologue HspA12B were expressed at higher levels in lesions than in nonlesional aortic tissue. These two genes represent novel candidates for atherosclerosis susceptibility.

As we move beyond the sequence of the human genome and use it to probe further into the function it encodes, whole-genome approaches to biology will be essential to deepening our understanding of complex disease. Disorders predisposing to CAD, such as insulin resistance, obesity, and hypertension, will likely involve small, quantitative differences in many genes, rather than major expression changes in a few genes, as exemplified by the PGC-1alpha study described above. To better tackle this complexity of biological systems, more sophisticated analytic approaches combining biological, statistical, mathematical, and engineering techniques are needed.

## Clinical Implications

It has been suggested that a deeper understanding of the genetics of atherosclerosis would revolutionize diagnosis and treatment (6). Such predictions have failed to materialize. This is partially due to the lack of progress in identifying genes for common forms of the disease. But even when such genes are identified, it may be difficult to apply the knowledge to risk assessment and diagnosis, given the enormous complexity of the disease and the important role played by environmental factors.

It is likely that the identification of genes and pathways contributing to atherosclerosis will translate into useful new forms of pharmacological intervention.
Molecular-genetic studies of Mendelian disorders, such as FH, have contributed greatly to our understanding of disease processes, and the resulting knowledge has been important to the development of therapeutic strategies. For example, the knowledge of pathways for cholesterol homeostasis from studies of FH has contributed to the development of drugs such as bile acid chelators and statins (28). Although excellent pharmacological interventions for hypercholesterolemia and hypertension are available, no effective treatments for any of the other risk factors have been developed. Of particular interest is intervention at the artery wall level, perhaps complementing interventions directed at systemic factors such as cholesterol levels. Although not discussed here, genetic approaches may also be useful in dissecting pathways contributing to restenosis, atherosclerosis following heart transplantation, plaque formation in coronary artery bypass grafts, calcification of bioprosthetic valves, and the development of dilated cardiomyopathy. In addition to traditional drug intervention, gene therapy efforts for atherosclerosis have already been initiated, and several promising strategies have been developed.

The most important consequence of understanding the genetics of atherosclerosis in more detail will likely be the ability to distinguish different forms of the disease to target pharmacological intervention. Atherosclerosis is heterogeneous, with respect to both genetics and environment. In a sense, different patients have different diseases, and the most appropriate therapy will differ depending on the particular variety of disease. Such classification is already utilized clinically because patients are grouped according to the variety of risk factors they display. Understanding the genetics of atherosclerosis, and the development of protein- or gene-based diagnostic tests, may greatly expand the possible subdivision of disease. Recent studies of 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) and atherosclerosis illustrate the concept. The 5LO gene (ALOX5) has common promoter polymorphisms that influence enzyme expression. These variants were originally found to be associated with asthma, and inhibitors of the 5LO pathway for leukotriene synthesis were deemed effective for treating asthma in some patients but not others. Drazen and colleagues (20) then showed that the clinical response to the inhibitors depended on the 5LO polymorphisms. Recently, Mehrabian and colleagues (56) provided evidence that 5LO gene variations underlie differences in susceptibility to atherosclerosis between certain strains of mice. Based on these findings, they extended their studies to a human population and observed a significant relationship between the human ALOX5 gene polymorphisms and intimal medial thickness, a measure of atherosclerosis (21). This raises the possibility that 5LO inhibitors may protect against atherosclerosis as well as asthma. But what if only a subset of atherosclerosis patients benefit from such treatment, as was the case for asthma? The polymorphism may, then, provide a means to determine which patients to treat with the inhibitors.

A potential long-term benefit of genetic approaches is susceptibility testing for CAD and stroke, complementing phenotype-based tests such as cholesterol levels and blood pressure. Once the genes contributing to common forms of the disease are identified, along with the specific nucleotide changes involved, DNA-based tests

may greatly add to our ability to assess risk. If the alleles involved in common forms of CAD are common, such tests will be inexpensive. Once genotype-based tests are widely implemented in the clinic, polymorphisms with even slight impact on risk may be significant in diagnosis and risk assessment.
