Abstract

Activating mutations of Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) are the most common genetic lesions in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and are present in approximately one third of AML patients. The 2 classes of Flt3 mutations are internal tandem duplications in the juxtamembrane domain and point mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain. In normal hematopoietic progenitor cells, Flt3 ligand induces the activation of several downstream signal-transduction mediators, including phosphoinositide 3-kinases, Src kinases, mitogen-activated protein kinases, and the phosphorylation of several adaptor proteins. Oncogenic mutations in Flt3 result in ligand-independent constitutive and deregulated activation of these signaling pathways. In addition, however, oncogenic mutations of Flt3 also result in the activation of aberrant signaling pathways, including strong activation of STAT5, induction of STAT target genes, and repression of myeloid transcription factors c/EBP-α and Pu.1. Aberrant activation of these signaling pathways by oncogenic Flt3 may play a critical role in mutant Flt3-mediated leukemic transformation.

1. Architecture and Expression of Flt3

Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) (also designated as fetal liver kinase 2 [Flk-2] and stem cell tyrosine kinase 1 [STK-1]) is a receptor tyrosine kinase of the subclass III family, which comprises membrane-bound receptors with 5 immunoglobulin-like extracellular domains, a transmembrane domain, and a kinase domain split by a so-called kinase insert with a regulatory function [1,2].

Human Flt3 maps to chromosome 13 (13q12) and comprises 24 exons [3]. Flt3 is expressed in 2 forms: a 160-kd membrane-bound, fully N-glycosylated mature form and a 130-kd incompletely glycosylated, mannose-rich immature form [4,5]. Flt3 is expressed on early hematopoietic progenitors and on B-cell and macrophage precursors [2,6,7]. Flt3 has been shown to serve important functions in early hematopoietic progenitor proliferation and survival as well as in macrophage and dendritic cell differentiation.

[1,2,8]. Flt3 expression analyses have revealed aberrant Flt3 expression on the surface of leukemic blasts in human acute leukemias, including most cases of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (greater than 90% of cases) and nearly all cases of B-lineage acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Flt3 expression can also be found in a considerable proportion of cases of chronic myeloid leukemia in blast crisis [9-11].

In contrast, the ligand for Flt3 (Flt3 ligand or FL) is almost ubiquitously expressed [12-14]. Therefore, the function of FL is likely to be specified by the restricted expression of its cognate receptor, Flt3.

2. Flt3 Mutations in Human Leukemias

Flt3 mutations, which were originally described in 1996 by Nakao et al [15], are present in approximately one third of AML cases, making Flt3 the most frequently mutated gene found in AML [1,2,15,16]. Flt3 mutations are also found in a small number of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome or acute lymphoblastic leukemia [17-19].

Two classes of Flt3 mutations have been described. The first class, consisting of internal tandem duplications (Flt3-ITDs) in exons 14 and/or 15 of the receptor, occur in approximately 25% of AML patients and lead to the insertion of several amino acid residues in the juxtamembrane domain

[1,15,16,20]. The second class, small deletions or insertions in the activation loop of the tyrosine kinase domain (Flt3-TKDs), occur in 7% of AML patients [16,21,22]. Most commonly, Flt3-TKD mutations involve the substitution of the aspartic acid residue at position 835 (D835) with other residues [16]. Deletion of I836, substitutions of N841 or Y842, and insertions of single amino acid residues in the activation loop have also been found [16,23-25].

## 3. Biological Consequences of Mutationally Activated Flt3

Activating Flt3-ITD mutations induce growth factor-independent proliferation and radiologic resistance of factor-dependent myeloid cell lines [26,27]. Furthermore, the expression of Flt3-ITD mutants enhances their leukemogenicity in vivo [27]. Flt3-ITD mutations also induce a myeloproliferative disease if they are retrovirally transduced into donor bone marrow in transplantation experiments [28]. In experiments with PML-RARα transgenic bone marrow, Flt3-ITDs strongly increased the penetrance and decreased the latency period for the development of acute promyelocytic leukemia in transplant-recipient mice [29,30]. Similarly to Flt3-ITD mutations, Flt3-TKD mutations induce factor-independent proliferation of hematopoietic cells [21]. However, recent data from our group and Grundler et al show that Flt3-TKD mutations fail to fully transform 32D cells in vitro and that these mutations induce a phenotypically different disease in recipients of retrovirally transduced murine bone marrow [31,32]. Thus, Flt3-ITD and Flt3-TKD mutations show differences in signal transduction and transforming potential.

## 4. Clinical Implications of Flt3 Mutations

Large patient series have been characterized with respect to the clinical differences among patients expressing Flt3-ITDs, wild-type Flt3 (Flt3-WT), and Flt3-TKDs [16]. Cytogenetic analyses have revealed that the highest prevalence of Flt3 mutations occurs particularly in patients with a normal karyotype. Flt3-ITD mutations are rarely present in core binding factor leukemias, which feature mutations in Kit, a closely related receptor tyrosine kinase, at high frequency [16,33-35]. Flt3-ITD mutations are now well documented to be associated with a poor prognosis, especially if the wild-type allele is lost in the majority of a patient’s blasts [1,16,33,36-38]. In contrast, Flt3-TKD mutations so far have not been shown to be of similar prognostic relevance, despite several studies with large patient series [16,21,22,37]. In addition, investigators have also described differences in the clinical presentation of AML patients with Flt3-ITD and Flt3-TKD mutations (ie, a higher white blood cell count in patients harboring Flt3-ITD mutations [16,21,39-41]). In a detailed clinical study by Thiede et al, some chromosomal aberrations, eg, -7/7q, +11/+13/+22/+22, inv(16), and t(16;16), were almost absent in patients with ITD mutations, but such cytogenetic aberrations were present at a frequency close to that in the overall population in samples that harbored Flt3-TKD mutations [16].

## 5. Activation Mechanisms of Oncogenic Flt3

Most wild-type Flt3 receptors are expressed on the cell surface as inactive monomers [42]. Binding of FL induces dimerization, which in turn leads to the autophosphorylation of the receptors in *trans* and to their activation [42]. Ligand-induced receptor dimerization is thought to expose tyrosine autophosphorylation sites and to stabilize the active conformational state, further enhancing receptor activation [42,43]. Recently, the structural basis for Flt3 and Kit receptor activation was elucidated [44-46]. The normal juxtamembrane domain adopts a well-organized β-sheet structure, which interacts with the kinase domain, buries the catalytic center of the kinase, and thus stabilizes the inactive kinase conformation. Ligand-induced dimerization and conformational changes lead to the phosphorylation of 2 key juxtamembrane tyrosine residues. This event destabilizes the conformation of the juxtamembrane domain and allows it to move away from the active center of the kinase, leading to its activation.

ITD mutations in the Flt3 juxtamembrane domain destroy the conformational integrity of this domain. This disruption makes the juxtamembrane domain incapable of inhibiting the kinase, allowing ligand-independent activation of the receptor [44]. The mechanisms by which TKD mutations activate Flt3 are not fully understood. However, the activation loop in the inactive state of the kinase is thought to fall into the active pocket of the kinase, thus blocking the access of ATP and substrate to the kinase domain [42]. Ligand-induced activation of the receptor leads to the phosphorylation of Y842 in the activation loop, bringing the activation loop into an open conformation and finally causing activation of the kinase. Mutations in the TKD are believed to mimic this effect in the absence of extracellular ligand.

## 6. Flt3 Signal Transduction

### 6.1. Autophosphorylation of Flt3

Activation of the Flt3 receptor by FL leads to rapid receptor autophosphorylation and activation of a large number of signaling intermediates [1,2]. The mature 160-kd Flt3 receptor isoform is expressed on the cell surface and becomes activated in response to FL [5,47]. However, in Flt3-ITD, both the mature 160-kd receptor isoform and the immature 130-kd receptor isoform are highly phosphorylated independently of ligand [27,47]. We recently observed that Flt3-TKD mutations mainly result in the phosphorylation of the mature 160-kd receptor isoform [31]. Although Flt3 activation has long been known to result in the autophosphorylation of its tyrosine residues, the pace of the mapping of Flt3 phosphorylation sites has unfortunately been quite slow; thus far, only 2 Flt3 tyrosine-phosphorylation sites (Y589 and Y591) are known. Furthermore, very little is known about the contribution of individual tyrosine residues to Flt3 signal transduction, and whether the ligand-activated wild-type receptor and mutationally activated receptors use similar tyrosine residues for signal transduction remains unknown. Also unknown is whether the stoichiometries of tyrosine phosphorylation are similar. Recently, Schmidt-Arras et al showed that premature phosphorylation of receptor tyrosine

kinases leads to a block in receptor maturation and to their retention in the endoplasmic reticulum [47]. Several previous studies reported that Flt3-ITD receptors (but not the Flt3-WT receptor) are associated with a chaperone, heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), in the endoplasmic reticulum [48-50]. Furthermore, Flt3-ITD-expressing cells but not Flt3-WT–expressing cells are sensitive to Hsp90 inhibitors alone or in combination therapy [48,50,51]. A more detailed knowledge about the differences in the details of Flt3 receptor autophosphorylation are likely to result in an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in mutational Flt3 activation and may open the way toward finding new drugs that target the molecular differences between physiological and oncogenic Flt3 activation.

### 6.2. The Shc/Ras/Erk Pathway

Activation of the Flt3-WT receptor by FL results in the rapid phosphorylation of several components of the Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [26,27]. The Ras-MAPK pathway is initiated via the recruitment of adaptor proteins such as Grb2 or Shc to tyrosine-phosphorylated residues on activated receptors. Relocation of a preformed Grb2/Sos complex to the plasma membrane by receptor binding facilitates the interaction of membrane-associated Ras with Sos, resulting in the exchange of Ras-bound guanosine diphosphate for guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and hence in Ras activation. Ras proteins are small GTPases that are present at the plasma membrane. Activated Ras in turn activates the serine/threonine kinase Raf-1 [52,53]. Raf-1 activation leads, through further activation of intermediate kinases, to the phosphorylation, activation, and nuclear translocation of Erk-1 and Erk-2, which catalyze the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of transcription factors [54]. Erk-1, Erk-2, and Shc are constitutively phosphorylated in cells with Flt3-ITD or Flt3-TKD mutant receptors [26,27,55,56]. The activation of Ras plays an important role in Flt3-ITD–mediated transformation of 32D cells [27].

### 6.3. Phosphoinositol 3-Kinase

Type IA phosphoinositol 3-kinases (PI3-Ks), a family of lipid kinases that catalyze the phosphorylation of phosphoinositol phosphates at the 3′ position, play an important role in intracellular signal transduction. They are composed of 2 subunits—p110, the catalytic subunit, and p85, the regulatory subunit. Murine Flt3 directly associates with p85 via its C terminus [57]. However, the mechanism of PI3-K activation by human Flt3 remains unknown because human Flt3 lacks the analogous PI3-K–binding consensus site and thus lacks the capacity to directly associate with PI3-K [58]. Therefore, the activation of PI3-K by human Flt3 may be mediated by adaptor proteins such as Gab-1, Gab-2, or SHP-2, which have been shown to be phosphorylated in response to FL and to associate with the p85 subunit of PI3-K [58]. Protein kinase B (PKB or Akt) is a serine/threonine kinase that is directly and indirectly activated by the lipid products of the PI3-K reaction. Akt plays a central role PI3-K signaling [59], and it is involved in multiple downstream biological functions, such as cell survival, proliferation, regulation of translation,

and cell growth [59]. Akt is activated by Flt3-WT in a ligand-dependent manner. Flt3 mutations result in constitutive activation of Akt [27,31,60]. Jonsson et al have reported that FOXO3a, a member of the Forkhead family of transcription factors and a downstream target of Akt, is phosphorylated and inactivated by the ligand-activated wild-type receptor [60]. Recently, Scheijen et al have shown Foxo3a to be constitutively phosphorylated and inactivated by Flt3-ITDs [61]. Constitutive phosphorylation of FOXO3a led to the translocation of FOXO3a from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and prevented the up-regulation of p27kip and Bcl-2 family member Bim, which are proteins involved in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis induction, respectively [61]. Akt-mediated inactivation of Foxo3a plays an important role in survival/anti-apoptosis pathways downstream of PI3-K [61]. Inhibitor studies have shown that rapamycin, an inhibitor of mTOR (a downstream target of Akt), together with the Flt3 inhibitor PKC412 synergistically inhibits the proliferation of myeloid cells that carry oncogenic Flt3 mutants [62].

### 6.4. The Jak/STAT Pathway

The Janus-activated kinases (Jaks) are cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases that play an important role in diverse signal transduction pathways governing cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. Activated Jaks often exert their biological functions by phosphorylating and thus activating STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) proteins. STAT proteins are members of a family of cytoplasmic transcription factors that are involved in signal transduction by cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. Jaks have occasionally been found to be constitutively activated in leukemias by chromosomal translocations such as Tel-Jak2 [63]. Very recently, a novel activating mutation in Jak-2 was found at a very high incidence among patients with various myeloproliferative disorders, such as polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and myeloid metaplasia with myelofibrosis [64-66]. Deregulated activation of STAT3 and STAT5 proteins have also been observed in human leukemias [67,68].

We and others have reported the constitutive activation of STAT5 by ITD-mutated Flt3 receptors, but not by ligand-stimulated Flt3-WT receptors, in myeloid and lymphoid cell lines and in primary murine bone marrow [26,27,32]. Furthermore, we and others recently have shown that, in contrast to Flt3-ITD, STAT5 is very weakly activated by Flt3-TKD mutant receptors and that this weak activation is followed by a weak induction of STAT target genes [31,32]. Only limited data are available for STAT5 activation in AML blasts, but these data demonstrate that STAT5 is indeed a target of Flt3-ITDs in AML and that the phosphorylation of STAT5 in Flt3-ITD–positive AML blasts can be diminished in response to Flt3-specific inhibitors [24,31,69].

Although there is general agreement that the aberrant activation of STAT5 by Flt3-ITDs occurs in AML, conflicting results exist about the role of STAT5 in mediating Flt3-WT signaling [26,27,70]. Zhang et al observed the activation of STAT5a but not STAT5b in FL-stimulated mouse bone marrow, and this activation resulted in a synergistic increase in the proliferation of myeloid progenitors [70]. However,

Laouar et al observed an important, FL-dependent role for STAT3, but not for STAT5, in the generation of dendritic cells from myeloid progenitors [71]. These results may be explained by different signaling requirements in different cell types, a hypothesis that raises the interesting question about whether oncogenic Flt3 signaling mimics physiological signals, albeit in the wrong target cells. More sophisticated model systems that tightly control for the cellular background of Flt3-ITD expression are needed to solve this problem.

The mechanisms of STAT protein activation by Flt3 are poorly understood, and the role of Jaks in Flt3 signaling remains controversial [70, 72, 73]. For instance, Tse et al found that Flt3-ITD activated Jak2 (but not other Jaks) in BAF/3 cells, whereas Murata et al found that Flt3-ITD activated Tyk2 but no other Jak [72, 73].

The results of 2 microarray experiments demonstrated that the aberrant activation of STAT proteins by Flt3-ITDs resulted in the up-regulation of several STAT5-responsive genes, such as Pim-1, Pim-2, and members of the SOCS (suppressor of cytokine signaling) protein family [74, 75]. These results are particularly interesting because recent data point to an important role of Pim kinases in the anti-apoptosis of hematopoietic cells [76–78]. The expression of both Pim-1 and Pim-2 was also found to be up-regulated in Flt3-ITD-positive AML cases [74, 75]. The role of STAT5 in Flt3-ITD-mediated cell growth is further emphasized by the result that the expression of a dominant-negative STAT5 or a dominant-negative form of Pim-1 or Pim-2 resulted in growth inhibition of Flt3-ITD-expressing cell lines [73–75].

Recent studies using an artificially generated constitutively active mutant of STAT5 have shed some important light on the role of STAT5 in the regulation of proliferation, survival, and the leukemic transformation of hematopoietic progenitors. For example, expression of a constitutively active STAT5 (caSTAT5) in human CD34+ cells led to the self-renewal of early stem cells and to the formation of cobblestone areas in long-term bone marrow cultures, a good surrogate parameter of early progenitor cell expansion [79]. Moreover, transplantation of murine bone marrow-expressing caSTAT5 resulted in a myeloproliferative disease in recipient animals [80].

An interesting observation is that the enforced expression of Flt3-ITDs in human CD34+ cells also resulted in increased self-renewal, the early formation of cobblestone areas, and an enhanced erythropoiesis of these cells, reportedly in a STAT5-dependent manner; this phenomenon was not supported by the ligand-activated Flt3-WT receptor [81]. Although such a conclusion would be premature, it is tempting to speculate that Flt3-ITD mutations may result in the initiation and maintenance of leukemic stem cells in a STAT5-dependent manner. At least, the recent data by Levis et al show that a Flt3-ITD is indeed expressed in blast subpopulations of AML patients and that these blasts retain the ability to induce AML in nonobese diabetic/severe combined immunodeficient recipient mice.

In conclusion, although a role for STAT5 in AML transformation has begun to be described, much more work needs to be performed to determine the exact role of STAT5 in leukemic progenitor cells. An elucidation of the molecular mechanisms linking STAT5 activation with Flt3-ITDs in these cells may teach us many general lessons about the disturbance in the balance of proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell self-renewal in leukemic stem cells. Furthermore, STAT5 may be an interesting new drug target in AML.

### 6.5. Src Family Kinases

Although src had been shown to directly associate with Flt3-WT in a ligand-dependent manner [82], the involvement of Src kinase activity in mediating the signal transduction of mutated Flt3 remained unknown. In a recent report, however, the activation of the Src family kinase (SFK) Lyn was analyzed in Flt3-WT– and Flt3-ITD–expressing cells [83]. Lyn kinase activity was found to be induced by Flt3-WT in an FL-dependent manner. In contrast, Lyn was constitutively phosphorylated by Flt3-ITDs, and this phosphorylation could be inhibited by selectively inhibiting Flt3 kinase activity [83]. The role of Lyn in Flt3 signaling was further corroborated with data that showed that the incubation of both FL-stimulated Flt3-WT and Flt3-ITD–positive cell lines with the SFK-specific inhibitors PP1 or PP2 resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of Lyn phosphorylation. The inhibition of SFKs also reduced the Flt3-ITD–mediated proliferation/viability of BAF/3 and MV4-11 cells [83].

### 6.6. Adaptor Proteins

Several adaptor proteins, such as Gab1, Gab2, c-Cbl, SHP-2, VAV, GAP, PLCγ, and SHIP, are reported to be involved in Flt3 signaling [56–58, 72, 82, 84–87]. However, the direct involvement of these adaptor proteins and their precise role in cells with mutated Flt3 receptors have not been studied in detail, and their contribution to mutant Flt3–mediated oncogenesis remains largely unknown.

### 6.7. Transcription Factors

The myeloid transcription factors Pu.1 and c/EBP-α play an important role in the differentiation of myeloid progenitors [88]. Both genes are found to be mutated in a significant proportion of AML patients [89, 90]. Imbalanced expression or impairments in the function of these transcription factors by mutations result in a block of differentiation [91, 92]. Therefore, the alteration of the expression of these transcription factors may have important implications in the development of AML [92]. Recent data from our laboratory and other laboratories show that both transcription factors are selectively repressed in myeloid cell lines by Flt3-ITDs but not by Flt3-WT or by Flt3-TKD mutations [74, 93, 94]. Expression of Flt3-ITDs, but not Flt3-WT, inhibited granulocyte colony-stimulating factor–mediated granulocytic differentiation of 32D cells, and this inhibition could be overcome by an inhibition of the Flt3-ITD mutant or by the overexpression of c/EBP-α [93, 94].

## 7. Conclusions

Oncogenic Flt3-ITD mutations induce aberrant signaling pathways in myeloid progenitor cells. In particular, Flt3-ITDs
induce (1) differential activation of STAT5 and its downstream targets, (2) differential activation of antiapoptotic pathways, (3) a different pattern of receptor autophosphorylation, (4) differential transcription factor regulation and differential block of myeloid cell differentiation, (5) self-renewal and the formation of early cobblestone areas in CD34+ cells, and (6) differential receptor maturation, Hsp90 association, and sensitivity to Hsp90 inhibitors. These examples are a few of the differences in the activation of signaling pathways by the physiologically normal Flt3-WT versus the oncogenic Flt3 receptors. Detailed analyses of these different signaling pathways in their proper cellular and subcellular organizations, as well as in their temporal contexts, will undoubtedly help us understand the general principles involved in leukemic transformation. Because leukemia models provide a unique opportunity to study cancer stem cells, elucidation of the role of Flt3-ITDs in these cells may also provide more general paradigms regarding the regulation of cancer stem cells by tyrosine kinases—a prerequisite for specifically targeting these cells in patients.
