Abstract: It has been known for a long time that cytomegalovirus (CMV) has evolved mechanisms that allow the escape from the host immune surveillance. In the past, many efforts have been done to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying this virus-mediated immune escape and thus virus persistence. However, it is unknown, whether CMV may also impair immune responses directed against tumor cells. This might have severe consequences on tumor progression and may explain the growing evidence for CMV-mediated oncomodulation. This review summarizes recent work on CMV-mediated immune escape mechanisms of tumor cells and oncomodulation and proposes novel aspects that may be important for understanding the CMV-associated tumor progression.

### 1. INTRODUCTION

Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) belongs to the β subgroup of herpes viruses (Herpesviridae) and has strict species specificity. Its double-stranded DNA genome (>230 kb) appears to contain approximately 192 unique open reading frames (ORFs) with the potential to encode a protein.¹ In fully permissive cells, viral replication occurs according to a cascade of three consecutive phases: immediate-early (IE), early (E), and late (L). The IE gene products, the major transcripts of which map to the major IE72 and IE86 families of proteins, play a pivotal role in regulating the expression of

E and L viral genes as well as regulating cellular gene expression. E and L viral gene products include viral functions associated with viral DNA replication and virus packing. It has been demonstrated that only part of HCMV ORFs (45 in fibroblasts) are essential for virus replication. Some genes were found to be required for viral replication in retinal pigment epithelial cells and microvascular endothelial cells, but not in fibroblasts, indicating their role in tropism.²

HCMV, like all herpesviruses, can establish lifelong persistence after primary infection.³ In contrast to primary infection that is generally asymptomatic, reactivation of the virus, particularly in the immunocompromised individual, often results in life-threatening disease. Moreover, HCMV infection has been associated with long-term illness, such as atherosclerosis, chronic rejection following solid organ transplantation and malignancies. Recent investigations have revealed high frequencies of HCMV in tumor tissues of malignancies such as colon cancer,⁴ malignant glioma,⁵ Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) negative Hodgkin’s disease,⁶ and prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia and prostatic carcinoma.⁷ In malignant cells HCMV DNA and proteins including IE72 protein, p52/76kD delayed early protein and pp65 tegument protein were detected.⁴,⁵,⁷ HCMV DNA and proteins (including those synthesized during productive infection) were detected in tumor tissues but not in normal adjacent tissue suggesting that HCMV is sustained in tumors because of persistent infection. Nevertheless, it should be also mentioned that at least in the mouse CMV model MCMV may also exert antitumoral effects as shown for B cell lymphoma.⁸

## 2. ONCOMODULATION BY HUMAN CYTOMEGALOVIRUS

Because past studies have failed to show that HCMV can transform normal human cells, HCMV has not been regarded as an oncogenic tumor virus. Recently, we proposed the term oncomodulation to express the ability of HCMV to modify tumor cell biology, a phenomenon that is independent from transformation.⁹ Oncomudulation was defined as the ability of the virus to catalyze an oncogenic process in which tumor cells provide an appropriate genetic environment (with disturbed function of signaling pathways, transcription factors, and tumor suppressor proteins) to facilitate the oncomodulatory potential of HCMV that cannot be manifested in normal cells. Data from experiments with HCMV-infected tumor cell lines implicate how HCMV infection might interfere with several key cellular pathways leading to enhanced survival, angiogenesis, cell motility, and adhesion.⁴,¹⁰–¹⁴

We established persistently and productively HCMV-infected neuroblastoma and rhabdomyosarcoma cell lines¹⁵. In addition, other persistently productively HCMV-infected tumor cell lines were derived from osteosarcoma¹⁶ and glioma¹⁷. Although numerous cell lines derived from different tumor entities were shown to be permissive to HCMV infection and the feasibility to establish long-term productive infections has been proved¹⁵–¹⁸ persistently HCMV-infected tumor cells to date gained little attention. It is probable that unlike acutely infected tumor cells, persistently infected tumor cells provide models that more closely resemble persistent infection of patient's tumor tissues and allow to study the long-term consequences of infection-mediated cellular changes such as resistance against apoptosis or increased tumor invasiveness.¹¹,¹⁹ These models in concert with pathological findings demonstrate that persistent infection of tumor cells is essential for oncomodulation by HCMV.¹⁰,¹¹ This means that HCMV persistence is based on the balance between HCMV-infected and non-infected tumor cells, that is, between virus replication and proliferation of non-infected cells. This balance may be because of cellular mechanisms that restrict viral replication in rapidly proliferating tumor cells of cancer tissues contrasting vigorous virus replication in quiescent cells of normal tissues.²⁰ Moreover, persistent infection of tumor cells may be because of establishment of slowly growing virus strains with mutations in coding sequences for virus regulatory proteins.¹⁰,¹⁶,¹⁷,²¹ The delicate relationship between HCMV and tumors has been demonstrated by the loss of HCMV after subculturing resected HCMV containing tumor tissues.¹⁵The ability of HCMV to prevent or delay cell death may enable infected cells to influence malignant properties of neighboring non-infected tumor cells, for example, by production of virus-induced soluble factors. ${}^{9,11}$

In addition to mechanisms outlined above, sustaining of persistent productive infection in tumor tissues requires prevention of host-derived immune responses which would eliminate virus-infected cells. The replication of HCMV in tumor cells but not in normal adjacent tissue suggests that the tumor itself may be an immune-privileged site in immune competent patients. The absence of HCMV specific cellular immune responses in these immune-privileged tumor sites would favor HCMV replication.

Cancer cells by themselves can escape from immune responses by diverse mechanisms including interference with recognition and effector functions of immune effector cells. In addition, HCMV developed a number of immune evasion strategies which may suppress both innate and adaptive arms of the immune system. Thus, the combination of intrinsic cellular with viral immune escape mechanisms in tumor cells may provide an elective environment for HCMV replication and enhance the ability of tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance.

Based on the current knowledge regarding the association between CMV and tumor progression as well as CMV-mediated immune escape mechanisms, in the following sections we outline potential scenarios in CMV-mediated tumor cell immune escape, a phenomenon largely neglected yet.

## 3. CMV-MEDIATED IMPAIRMENT OF THE TUMOR CELL-DIRECTED IMMUNE RESPONSE

Escape from tumor cell-mediated immune responses, in particular cytotoxic CD8+ T lymphocyte (CTL), may play a major role in tumor progression. Studies in animal models indicated that CMV specific CTL that are able to eliminate CMV-infected cells play a central, although not exclusive role in protection from CMV disease and survival. ${}^{22}$ In HCMV-infected individuals, CTLs directed against virus-infected cells have been shown to provide protective immunity and mediate clearance of virus in the host as well as enable recovery from HCMV infections. HCMV specific CD4+ T-cells play a key role in the early activation of CD8+ T-cells and for B-cell development, as well as for direct inhibition of virus replication by the release of antiviral cytokines. Moreover, NK cells which play an important role in the innate immune response are generally believed to particularly take part in the combat of HCMV infected cells. ${}^{23}$

Although molecular mechanisms of CMV interference with CTL or immune responses are relatively well understood, there is little evidence for their role *in vivo*. This may be because of the fact that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) *in vivo* express high level of major histocompatibility (MHC) proteins but low levels of viral gene products. Moreover, only a small fraction of APCs is infected and thus it is not clear whether the uptake of HCMV antigens by uninfected APCs may be sufficient to effectively prime or initiate immune responses. ${}^{24}$ Therefore, we here focus on CMV-mediated effects on the direct interaction between infected tumor cells and effector cells.

### A. CMV-Mediated Tumor Cell Immune Escape by Impairing HLA Class I and II Molecule Expression

Tumor cells may escape from immune surveillance by several strategies ${}^{25}$ resulting in immune ignorance, induction of clonal anergy of tumor-specific T-cells, downregulation of antigen presentation, and loss of expression of tumor antigens. Recently, tumor cells were shown to escape from immune recognition via antigenic drift, ${}^{26}$ that is, by mutations developed in tumor antigenic epitopes, a mechanism that is well established for viral escape variants *in vivo*. These mutations severely diminish T-cell recognition of the tumor antigen by a variety of mechanisms, including

![Figure 1](#fig1)

**Figure 1.** Tumor cells may escape from CTL-mediated lysis (**A**), for example, by downregulation of MHC Class I surface expression and thus efficient presentation of tumor specific antigens (**B**). Similar mechanisms are known as for HCMV immune escape (**C**). It is conceivable that infection of tumor cells with HCMV may not only lead to immune escape from virus specific immunity but may also further impair tumor antigen specific immune responses (**D**). [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.]

modulation of MHC:peptide interaction and T-cell receptor (TCR) binding to MHC:peptide complex.²⁶ Because it is well known that CMV impairs important antigen presentation properties of the host cell, the combination of viral and cellular mechanisms may amplify the “immune escape phenotype” of infected tumor cells (Fig. 1).

### B. CMV-Mediated Tumor Cell Immune Escape by Impairing HLA Class I Molecule Expression

HCMV infected tumor cells may escape CTL activity similarly to normal cells as suggested in models using astroglia cells infected with HCMV or expressing HCMV proteins.²⁷ Although most of the CMV-mediated effects on the escape from CTL activity were studied in the context of viral peptide presentation, it is conceivable that HCMV immune-evasion proteins may also interfere with the presentation of tumor specific antigens on the surface of infected cells.

Data obtained in the mouse model suggest that direct presentation or cross-presentation of MCMV antigenic peptides by professional APCs can efficiently prime CD8+ T-cells. However, these cells fail to protect from MCMV organ disease,²⁸ probably because of the MCMV protein gp40 (coded by the m152 gene) that blocks transportation of MHC Class I molecules from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi compartments.²⁹

As for the human virus, HCMV was shown to encode at least four immunomodulatory proteins—glycoproteins (gp) designated unique short 2 (US2), gpUS3, gpUS6, and gpUS11—which decrease cell surface expression of MHC Class I proteins. These are single transmembrane (TM)-spanning

proteins, belonging to the immunoglobulin (Ig) domain family.³⁰ Each of the four functional genes encodes a protein that is dispensable for viral replication but may impede CTL immune surveillance by reducing the levels of MHC Class I proteins on the surface of infected cells,²²,³⁰ by targeting different steps in the HLA Class I antigen presentation pathway (Fig. 1, Table I). The diverse number of viral HCMV proteins interfering with HLA Class I molecules possibly ensure that HCMV can interfere with a wide variety of HLA Class I alleles and thereby provide protection against CTL attack as shown in Figure 1. The US3 gene product, gpUS3, is an IE gene product that prevents egress of MHC Class I proteins from the ER to Golgi apparatus³¹,³² by anchoring of the ER-lumenal Ig-like

fold of the US3 protein to the membrane of ER.³³ Interestingly, HCMV US3 affects only Class I alleles that are dependent on tapasin for peptide loading and surface expression.³⁴ Similar allele specific differences have been described for US2 and US11 gene products resulting in selective degradation of HLA Class I heavy chains.³⁵ In the early phase of infection, gpUS2 and gpUS11, independently bind to newly synthesized HLA Class I molecules in the ER and redirect the Class I heavy chain to the cytosol, via the Sec61 translocon, where the heavy chain is deglycosylated and degraded by the proteasome.³⁶⁻³⁸ The product of US6, gpUS6, complexes with the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) in the lumen of ER, locking the conformation of TAP to prevent ATP-dependent peptide loading.³⁹,⁴⁰

HCMV encodes proteins that are evolutionary related to host MHC Class I proteins and some that mimic the behavior of non-classical MHC proteins. Like host MHC class I molecules, the HCMV MHC Class I homolog (gpUL18) binds β2 microglobulin and peptide.⁴¹ Similar to a broad range of classical and non-classical MHC Class I molecules, gpUL18 binds with leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor 1 (LIR1), an inhibitory receptor prominently displayed on monocytes, dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and a subset of NK cells.⁴² gpUL18 binds with LIR-1 with a thousand-fold higher affinity than classic Class I proteins.⁴¹ Since LIR-1 signaling inhibits cellular functions such as cytotoxicity, cytokine production, and antigen presenting cell activation, it is conceivable that gpUL18 might be important for inducing immune tolerance and thereby escape immune surveillance. Interestingly, LIR-1 expression on peripheral blood lymphocytes of lung-transplant recipients increased in the patients who developed HCMV disease.⁴³

### C. CMV-Mediated Tumor Cell Immune Escape by Impairing HLA Class II Molecule Expression

HLA Class II molecules, designated HLA-DR, -DP, and -DQ in humans, show restricted cell distribution, being expressed constitutively in professional antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells, B-lymphocytes, and macrophages. Many cell types without constitutive HLA Class II expression may express these molecules upon stimulation, for example, with cytokines. In some malignancies, strong expression of HLA Class II molecules in tumor cells was associated with lymphocyte infiltration and a better prognosis, whereas downregulation of HLA Class II played a significant role in metastatic progression.⁴⁴,⁴⁵ HCMV may affect the constitutive or induced HLA Class I/II molecule expression in infected cells (Fig. 1).⁴⁶⁻⁴⁸ In addition to effects on MHC Class I proteins, gpUS2 has been shown to impede the translocation of MHC Class II proteins (mediating degradation of the HLA-DR and HLA-DM α chains in HLA-DR-stable transfected cells) and could afford HCMV the capacity to evade CD4+ T-cell effector functions as measured by IFN-γ production (Table I).²⁷,⁴⁸ The viral protein US3 was suggested to collaborate with US2, to reduce HLA Class II molecule expression, by an interference with the transportation of the HLA Class II complex from the ER to the Class II compartment (Table I).⁴⁹

Moreover, HCMV modulates the inducible HLA Class II molecule expression on infected cells. The IFN-γ-induced HLA Class II molecule expression on endothelial cells was shown to be blocked by a disruption of the Jak/Stat signaling pathway, through the degradation of the Jak-1 protein, which prevented the activation of the Class II transactivator (CIITA).⁴⁶,⁵⁰ The HCMV gene(s) mediating this

transcriptional effect on HLA Class II molecule expression is still unknown. Recent investigations demonstrated that HCMV UL83 coded pp65 virion protein suppresses the upregulation of IFN-responsive genes.¹¹ Moreover, pp65 was shown to induce decreased expression of HLA-DR, by mediating and accumulation of HLA Class II molecules in lysosomes that results in degradation of the HLA-DR α chain.⁵²

### D. CMV-Related Tumor Cell Evasion From NK Cell-Mediated Cytotoxicity

The expression of MHC I class antigens on normal cells at levels that allow sufficient binding of NK inhibitory receptor may enable cells to escape NK lysis. NK cells represent a natural defense to sense and selectively eliminate tumor cells that exert a decrease or loss of MHC Class I expression. Therefore expression of virus-encoded Class I homolog could be one of the most important immune escape mechanisms for infected tumor cells (Table I, Fig. 2). HCMV developed several strategies to escape from recognition by NK cells. HCMV US2-US11 family of ORFs predictable render infected cells vulnerable to NK cells because of downmodulation of normal MHC Class I expression which serve as inhibitors of NK lysis; hence, HCMV presumably uses other mechanisms to escape from NK cell control. Most studies so far published have focused on the receptor-ligand hypothesis, that is, that HCMV-infected cells inhibit NK lysis by delivering inhibitory signals to the NK cells (Fig. 2). HLA Class I-related genes, HLA-A, -B, -C, or -G participate in delivering such inhibitory signals by binding to killer inhibitory receptors on NK cells including isoforms of the killer cell


**Figure 2.** In contrast to non-transformed cells (**A**), tumor cells may be lysed by NK cells because of the reduced expression of MHC Class I molecules on tumor cells (**B**) which are important for providing signals via the killer inhibitory receptor on NK cells. In HCMV-infected tumor cells, viral proteins, known as “MHC Class I homologs,” may substitute for the lack of natural MHC Class I and inhibit NK cell-mediated lysis (**C**). In addition, viral proteins may bind to and block tumor cell proteins, which are important for stimulating the killer activity receptor on NK cells. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at www.interscience.wiley.com.]

immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) and immunoglobulin-like transcript/leukocyte immunoglobulin like receptors (ILT/LIR). A heterodimer formed by the C-type lectin CD94/NKG2A represents inhibitory receptor on NK cells that binds to the non-classical Class I molecule HLA-E. The leader sequence of human HCMV gpUL 40 contains an HLA-E-binding peptide. Adenoviral expression of UL40 in cell lines induced TAP-independent upregulation of HLA-E cell surface expression and elicited protection against lysis by NK cells by binding to CD94/NKG2A. Kinetic analysis revealed that HCMV infection protected against CD94/NKG2A killing during productive infection but not during early times post infection.

An important role for gpUL 40 in the protection against NK lysis was demonstrated by using UL40 knockout HCMV strains that mediated an increased susceptibility to NK lysis as compared to cells infected with wild HCMV strains. The second example of HCMV protein that has also been suggested to mediate increased resistance to NK lysis is gpUL 16, which binds to the non-classical MHC proteins MHC Class I chain-related gene B (MICB), and UL16-binding proteins (ULBP) 1 and ULBP 2, but not to MICA or ULBP 3 (Table I). These host proteins are normally responsible for binding to the activating NKG2D receptor. Therefore, gpUL 16 binding to ULBP or MICB would be expected to prevent activation of NK cells. Soluble UL16 can block binding of NKG2D to ULBP 1 and 2 and to MICB. Moreover, an ectodomain of UL16 was shown to participate in downregulation of MICB and ULBPs by their intracellular sequestration resulting in protection against NK cell cytotoxicity. Importance of UL16 for immune escape was shown by experiments demonstrating that fibroblasts infected with the UL16 knockout HCMV strain exhibited an increased susceptibility to NK lysis as compared to HCMV-infected cells and uninfected cells.

Although HCMV gpUL 18 binds with high affinity to inhibitory receptor LIR1 on NK cells, its role in NK escape is questionable since the cells infected with a deletion mutant of HCMV lacking the UL18 gene also demonstrated an increased resistance to NK lysis. In contrast, the MHC Class I homolog m144 encoded by MCMV appears to be of importance for protection of MCMV-infected cells against NK killing. To address whether MCMV Class I homolog m144 (Table I) could directly inhibit NK cell effector function and/or NK cell activation in a syngeneic model m144 was transfected into a mouse Class I-deficient lymphoma. These experiments demonstrated that at least tenfold less lymphoma cells expressing m144 were required to establish tumors when compared with control lymphoma cells. The accumulation of NK cells in the peritoneum was reduced in mice challenged with m144-transfected lymphoma cells, as was the lytic activity of NK cells recovered from peritoneum. Moreover, surviving of mice inoculated with m144 transfected tumor cells was significantly decreased when compared with animals inoculated with control tumor cells. The finding that m144 can confer protection to syngeneic lymphoma cells from activated NK cell-mediated lysis in vivo, is the first evidence that CMV evasion proteins may enable tumor cells to escape from immune surveillance which promotes tumor growth. A summary of the CMV-mediated impairment of NK cell function is provided in Figure 2.

E. CMV-Mediated Tumor Cell Immune Escape by Stimulation of Immunosuppressive Cytokines

One of the major immunosuppressive cytokines is IL-10, known to inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine synthesis. HCMV encodes a viral IL-10 homolog (UL111a) which is suggested to bind to the cellular human IL-10 receptor, through which it mediates its activity. Although HCMV IL-10 possesses relatively low level (25%) of amino acid sequence identity with human IL-10, it exerts potent immunosuppressive properties such as the ability to inhibit proliferation of and cytokine synthesis by mitogen-stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes similar to human IL-10 (Fig. 3). HCMV IL-10 was observed to decrease cell surface expression of both MHC Class I and Class II complexes, while increasing non-classical MHC allele HLA-G. It has been shown that a low-passage clinical isolate of HCMV may stimulate production of human IL-10 in macrophages probably

**Figure 3.** The major effector mechanisms for tumor cell killing may be the induction of tumor cell apoptosis via specific death receptor-mediated signaling and/or secretion of cytotoxic molecules such as granzyme B or perforin (A). Several HCMV-induced escape mechanisms can be assumed in this regard. HCMV encodes or stimulates cellular antiapoptotic proteins that protect the infected tumor cells from cytotoxic agents and/or from apoptosis (B). HCMV infection leads to enhanced expression of death receptor ligands that may induce apoptosis in immune effector cells (C). HCMV-infected tumor cells secrete, for example, immune suppressive cytokines that may inhibit effector cells (D).

indirectly through TNF-$\alpha$ activity. ${ }^{62}$ However, these effects may be virus strain dependent, since other authors did not find IL-10 production in macrophages infected with laboratory strain AD169. ${ }^{63}$ On the other hand, in murine CMV-infected cells, a decreased expression of MHC Class II molecules and a reduced T-cell response have been shown to be mediated by an autocrine induction of cellular IL-10. ${ }^{64}$

Transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$) was not produced from HCMV-infected macrophages but it was stimulated by HCMV in different types of permissive cell lines. ${ }^{63}$ The examination of brain tissue from patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome who had HCMV encephalitis showed colocalization of HCMV inclusions and TGF-$\beta$ in cells that contained astrocyte-specific glial filaments. ${ }^{65}$ Moreover, cultures of primary murine astrocytes inoculated with MCMV expressed, over time, increasing amounts of infectious MCMV in parallel with increasing levels of TGF-$\beta$. ${ }^{65}$ These findings suggest that MCMV infection of astrocytes induces the production of TGF-$\beta$, which in turn enhances productive MCMV infection. Although the significance of these findings for immune response is not clear, it may be speculated that HCMV-induced TGF-$\beta$ represents one of the mechanisms that downregulates lymphocyte function. Interestingly, HCMV was shown to increase TGF-$\beta$ production in glioblastoma cells. ${ }^{66}$ The virus-induced enhancement of TGF-$\beta$ production may decrease immune reactivity of gliomas as TGF-$\beta$ is known to impair tumor cell-directed CTL and NK responses (Fig. 3). ${ }^{67}$

HCMV encodes four G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homologs, UL33, UL78, US27, and US28. US28 appears to be functional in many different aspects. US28 is expressed early after infection and shows highest homology (33%) to the CC chemokine receptor CCR1.68 US28 is capable of binding the CC chemokines RANTES/CCL5, MCP-1/CCL2, MIP-1α/CCL3, and MIP-1β/CCL4, as well as the membrane-associated CX3C chemokine fractalkine/CX3CL1.69,70 US28 may play an important role in immune evasion by sequestering chemokines to limit the recruitment of immune effector cells and thus may enable HCMV-infected tumor cells to evade immune surveillance. Expression of US28 leads to internalization of RANTES and MCP-1 in fibroblasts and endothelial cells, which suggests that the receptor functions as a CC-chemokine sink.71,72 On the other hand, US28 signaling enhanced by sequestered chemokines (e.g., fractalkine) on HCMV-infected tumor cells may result in tumor progression and metastasis formation as demonstrated for GPCR signaling of cellular chemokine receptors.73

HCMV has the ability to influence distinct molecular pathways, leading to activation of cellular transcription factors without the requirement for viral gene expression. HCMV initiates infection and intracellular signaling by binding to its cellular cognate receptors and by activating several signaling pathways, including those mediating by PI3K,74 mitogen-activated protein kinases,75,76 and G proteins.77 The cellular signaling pathways activate multiple transcription factors, including nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), activator protein 1 (AP1), SP-1, and Elk-1, which bind to promoters of cellular genes. Recent findings indicated that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a necessary component for HCMV-triggered signaling and viral entry.78 Interaction of HCMV with Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and CD14 was shown to activate cytokine responses through NF-κB.79

Several HCMV gene products may influence cellular signaling. For example, UL122 and UL123 HCMV proteins can individually activate the PI3K pathway.80 HCMV US28, despite its effects on chemokine sequestration as outlined above may also play an important role in signal transduction. However, although US28 has a rather broad-spectrum ligand repertoire (see above), US28 signals independently from any ligand in a highly constitutive manner. US28 stimulates the G protein Gq/phospholipase C pathway and upregulates cellular transcription factors including NF-κB and the cAMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB), in the absence of any ligand. To date, fractalkine/CX3CL1 represents the only one chemokine ligand modulating the constitutive signaling activity of US28.81,82 In addition to US28, other HCMV-encoded proteins, such as UL33, may activate G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling in a ligand-independent manner.83 HCMV-induced GPCR signaling was shown to induce expression and activity of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (PLA2) in different cell types,77,84 which is one of the major metabolic pathways leading to formation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA).85 Recently, it has been demonstrated that formation of LPA may similar to chemokines induce chemotaxis of NK cells. However, in contrast to chemokines, which enhance the cytotoxicity of NK cells, LPA and other lysolipids inhibit this function.86 These findings show that HCMV developed multiple ways how to influence the homeostasis of infected cells and thus key cellular processes which may be relevant for immune effector functions directed against tumor cells.

HCMV has been shown to protect host cells from apoptosis by reduction of different cellular (Bcl-2, p73ΔN, and PI3K/AKT) and viral (IE1, IE2, vMIA, and vCIA) mechanisms (Table II).

viral UL36 gene has been identified. vICA binds to the prodomain of caspase-8 thus inhibiting Fas-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, the IE antiapoptotic UL37×1 gene product, viral mitochondrion-localized inhibitor of apoptosis (vMIA) is able to inhibit apoptosis by blocking permeabilization of the mitochondrial outer membrane. HCMV IE1 and IE2 were also shown to inhibit apoptosis induced by different stimuli.

mechanism inhibiting granzyme activity. For example, tumor cells may overexpress serin protease inhibitor (serpin) PI-9 which irreversibly inactivates granzyme B and prevents CTL-induced killing by perforin pathway. ${ }^{100}$ As discussed above, HCMV interferes with CD95-dependent effector mechanisms primarily by vICA encoded by the viral UL36. This viral protein that exhibit behavior similar to cellular FLICE-ligand inhibitory proteins (FLIPs) inhibited CD95-dependent apoptosis in human tumor cell lines. ${ }^{87}$ Moreover, HCMV was shown to interfere with mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in tumor cells by viral UL37×1 (vMIA) protein ${ }^{88}$ and by its ability to upregulate Bcl-2. ${ }^{4,11}$ In HeLa cells and neuroblastoma cells, both vMIA and viral-induced Bcl-2 were shown to protect against apoptosis induced by chemotherapeutic drugs. ${ }^{11,88}$ Recent findings demonstrated that tumor cells transfected with Bcl-2 are resistant to granzyme B because of inhibition of caspase 3 processing and prevention of mitochondrial disruption. ${ }^{101}$ These findings suggest that HCMV infection of tumor cells may be a very powerful mechanism promoting immune evasion, since the virus has ability to interfere with apoptotic pathways induced by different effector mechanisms (Fig. 3).

It is not clear whether HCMV-induced death receptor ligands in tumor cells would interfere with activity of immune effector cells. However, HCMV-induced FasL expression in retinal pigment epithelial cells resulted in the induction of apoptosis of Fas positive neutrophils ${ }^{93}$, whereas FasL and TRAIL expression enabled HCMV-infected dendritic cells to delete activated T lymphocytes. ${ }^{95}$ TNF-$\alpha$ expression was found to be induced in cultures of HCMV-infected glioblastoma cells. ${ }^{92}$ The production of TNF-$\alpha$ could result in induction of lymphocyte apoptosis, whereas infected tumor cells would not be influenced by TNF-$\alpha$ since HCMV prevents TNF-$\alpha$ signaling in the host cell by impairing TNFRI surface-membrane expression. ${ }^{92}$

### 4. CONCLUDING REMARKS

HCMV immune evasion proteins and virus-induced cellular factors could contribute to the ability of tumor cells to evade immune responses by CTLs and NK cells. These effects may be because of the HCMV-mediated interference with cellular immune recognition and effector functions. In normal tissues, decreased potential of CTLs and NK cells to recognize infected target cells, and to become activated, leads to latent or persistent infection (with low levels of viral protein expression), whereas the residual immune response is sufficient to control productive viral infection. In contrast, amplification of intrinsic immune evasion mechanisms in tumor cells by HCMV may enable them to further escape immune surveillance and contribute to sustaining persistent infection. These immune escape mechanisms may explain recent pathological findings demonstrating persistent productive HCMV infection in tumors but not in normal adjacent tissues of patients with different solid malignancies.

Infection with MCMV provided insights in mechanisms which may also play a role in host immune responses during infection with HCMV. ${ }^{22}$ Therefore, this animal model may be important to study interactions between the immune system and virus-infected tumors. It is of interest to establish mouse tumor cell lines persistently infected with MCMV for the in vivo evaluation of immune responses to viral and tumor antigens. Moreover, tumors expressing mouse CMV immune evasion proteins should be tested in vivo. For example, MCMV m152-encoded gp40 both retains peptide-loaded MHC-I complexes in a cis-Golgi compartment ${ }^{29}$ and diminishes the ligand for the activating NK cell receptor NKG2D on the surface of infected cells. ${ }^{102}$ Recent findings demonstrate that m152/gp40 prevents presentation of MCMV peptide in pathologically relevant tissues and activity of efficiently primed CD8T-cells to protect against MCMV organ disease. ${ }^{28}$ Moreover, it has been demonstrated that expression of MCMV Class I homolog m144 in lymphoma cells increased tumor growth and decreased surviving after inoculation in syngeneic model by protection from NK cell-mediated lysis. ${ }^{59}$ Such in vivo observations justify experiments with tumor tissues expressing m152/
gp40 or other MCMV immune evasion proteins (Table I) as well as proteins which interfere with effector functions of immune cells in mouse model. Availability of transgenic mice that develop tumors with high frequency enable to introduce viral genes coding for evasion proteins in genome of animals and observe whether this may influence tumor development. Future pathological examinations should be focused on comparison of immune responses between HCMV-infected and non-infected tumor tissues. Given a requirement for persistent productive infection for HCMV oncomodulatory effects, there is a hope that the treatment with antiviral agents eliminating virus from tumor tissues would improve patient's immune responses. This may be important to suppress tumor progression and to improve outcome of immune therapies.
