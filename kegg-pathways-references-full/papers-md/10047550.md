# Biochemistry of type IV secretion
Drusilla L Burns

In the past year, our knowledge of type IV transporters of Gram-negative bacteria has further expanded. Advances include the discovery of additional members of this family of proteins, increased knowledge of the morphologies of type IV transporters, and a better understanding of the mechanisms by which macromolecules are exported by these systems.

Alignment of genes encoding type IV transporter systems. These systems include the VirB system of A. tumefaciens, the Ptl system of B.
Extensive work has been done to elucidate interactions between VirB proteins. VirB7, which is known to be a lipoprotein [22, 30*], appears to be critical for the structural integrity of the VirB apparatus in that in-frame deletions in *virB7* result in destabilization of many of the VirB proteins including VirB4, VirB5, VirB8, VirB9, VirB10, and VirB11 [31]. Direct interactions between VirB proteins have been visualized for VirB7–VirB7 [32], VirB7–Vir
is transported across the outer membrane. Finally, in the absence of an intact Ptl system, biologically active pertussis toxin accumulates in the cell [14]. These findings are most consistent with a two-step model in which the toxin subunits first individually cross the cytoplasmic membrane followed by assembly of the holotoxin in the periplasmic space and finally transport of the holotoxin via the Ptl apparatus across the final bacterial membrane barrier.

### Evolution of type IV transporters

The striking homologies between members of type IV transporters that carry out vastly different functions are intriguing and bring up the question of how this family
