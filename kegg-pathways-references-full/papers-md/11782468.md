Biochemical and clinical evidence indicates that monomethylated selenium compounds are crucial for the tumor preventive effects of the trace element selenium and that methylselenol (CH₃SeH) is a key metabolite. As suggested by Ganther (Ganther, H. E. (1999) Carcinogenesis 20, 1657–1666), methylselenol and its precursor methylseleninate might exert their effects by inhibition of the selenoenzyme thioredoxin reductase via the irreversible formation of a diselenide bridge. Here we report that methylseleninate does not act as an inhibitor of mammalian thioredoxin reductase but is in fact an excellent substrate (*K*~m~ of 18 μM, *k*~cat~ of 23 s⁻¹), which is reduced by the enzyme according to the equation 2 NADPH + 2 H⁺ + CH₃SeO₂H → 2 NADP⁺ + 2 H₂O + CH₃SeH. The selenium-containing product of this reaction was identified by mass spectrometry. Nascent methylselenol was found to efficiently reduce both H₂O₂ and glutathione disulfide. The implications of these findings for the antitumor activity of selenium are discussed. Methylseleninate was a poor substrate not only for human glutathione reductase but also for the non-selenium thioredoxin reductases enzymes from *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Plasmodium falciparum*. This suggests that the catalytic selenocysteine residue of mammalian thioredoxin reductase is essential for methylseleninate reduction.

tase (TrxR,¹ EC 1.6.4.5, thioredoxin-S₂ + NADPH + H⁺ ⇌ thioredoxin-(SH)₂ + NADP⁺) and its genuine substrate thioredoxin (Trx) are involved in a multitude of cellular metabolic and regulatory pathways, many thereof known to be of importance or (like the reduction of ribonucleotides by ribonucleotide reductase) even essential for the propagation of neoplastic and other diseases. However, due to the involvement of the thioredoxin system in the defense against oxidative stress, the inhibition of TrxR may not be solely beneficial (10–13).

To test the above hypothesis, mice were fed with methylseleninic acid (CH₃SeO₂H), a precursor of methylselenol (14). The rodents showed no alteration in TrxR levels and activities. In an *in vitro* approach, the compound appeared to be a weak competitive inhibitor of TrxR. The concentrations required for inhibition were too high to be of physiological importance. Due to the lack of highly purified enzyme, experiments using quasi-physiologic concentrations of enzyme, NADPH, and methylseleninate were not conducted (14). As reported here, we were also unable to find any inhibition in typical incubation experiments using pure enzyme. However, we noticed an unpleasant smell in the sample containing TrxR, methylseleninate, and NADPH that was absent in NADPH-free samples. This indicated the presence of volatile methylselenol as a product of a TrxR-catalyzed reaction (2 NADPH + 2 H⁺ + CH₃SeO₂H → 2 NADP⁺ + CH₃SeH + 2 H₂O).

Methylseleninate, a New Substrate of Human TrxR

(5–1000 μM) consisting of T buffer, 100 μM NADPH, and enzyme in a total volume of 1 ml. After the addition of enzyme, the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored (ε₃₄₀ nm 6.22 mM⁻¹ cm⁻¹).

Reaction of Thioredoxin with CH₃SeO₂⁻—The effects of thioredoxin on the reduction of CH₃SeO₂⁻ were determined by enzymatic reduction of varying concentrations of hTrxS₂ (0–200 μM) prior to the addition of methylseleninate ad 200 μM. The initial NADPH concentration was adjusted for each concentration of hTrxS₂ to yield a final concentration of 100 μM after the reduction of the hTrxS₂.

Peroxidase Assays in the Presence of CH₃SeO₂⁻—Hydroperoxides were studied as substrates using H₂O₂ and *t*-butyl-hydroperoxide. The peroxidase activity of hTrxR was determined by observing the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm (ε₃₄₀ nm 6.22 mM⁻¹ cm⁻¹) in an assay containing hTrxR, 100 μM NADPH in the absence and presence of 40 μM hydroperoxide (final concentrations). After 5 min, methylseleninate was added ad 10 μM. In a modification of this experiment, 100 nM of the TrxR inhibitor auranofin was added thereafter.

Protective effects against auranofin-mediated inhibition of TrxR by the nascent methylselenolate were investigated in an assay containing 3 nM hTrxR subunit, 10 μM methylseleninate, and 100 μM NADPH. When reduction of the methylseleninate was complete, the hTrxR inhibitor auranofin was added ad 500 nM (ratio [CH₃Se⁻]:[auranofin] = (20:1)). After 1 min, methylseleninate was added to determine remaining enzymatic activity.

Preincubation Study—1 μM hTrxR-subunit was incubated with and without 200 μM NADPH either in the presence or in the absence of 1 μM methylseleninate. After 15 min, 1-μl samples were withdrawn, and the activity was determined in the DTNB reduction assay (assay volume, 1 ml). The remaining solutions were dialyzed exhaustively against T buffer and assayed for oxidase activity.

Methylselenol Production and Identification—To verify the formation of the presumed product (methylselenol), we made use of the fact that selenols precipitate as silver-colored selenolates when passing through an aqueous AgNO₃ solution. An apparatus essentially as described in Ref. 25 was used. The experiment was carried out in a hood since volatile selenium compounds are toxic. 100 mg of NADPH was dissolved in 500 μl of T buffer in a gas-tight vial with a rubber septum and made anaerobic by flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen. 1.5 nmol of hTrxR subunit and 32 μmol of methylseleninate (from neutralized stock solution) were dissolved in a total of 1700 μl of degassed T buffer. The solution was made anaerobic by flushing with oxygen-free nitrogen (70 ml min⁻¹) under continuous stirring for 20 min. Then the anaerobic NADPH was added rapidly under uninterrupted nitrogen flow. A few minutes later, a yellow brownish precipitate was formed in the 0.1 M AgNO₃ trapping solution. After 30 min, 1 ml of 50% H₃PO₄ was added to the enzyme solution to volatilize remaining CH₃Se anions. The pKₐ of selenols is ~5.7. Thus at pH 7.4 (T buffer), the majority of the produced methylselenol is present as the deprotonated methylselenolate (for comparison, pKₐ (of thiols ≥ 8.5), see Ref. 9). Nitrogen flushing was continued for another 15 min. The trapping vial containing the precipitate was centrifuged. If the precipitate was adhering to the vial surface, the closed vial was put into an ultrasonic bath for a few minutes. To remove remaining AgNO₃, the dark yellow precipitate was resuspended twice in distilled water and centrifuged. A sample of the precipitate was then spread on a chromium-coated sample target and subjected to laser desorption/ionization (LDI) mass spectrometry. A Bruker-Biflex time-of-flight (TOF) instrument in positive-ion reflector mode with pulsed ion extraction was used for this purpose. As a positive control, synthetic methylselenol was produced (26): in an anaerobic solution, 30 μmol of methylseleninic acid was reduced using zinc as the reductant. The reaction was initiated by adding an equal volume of anaerobic 50% (w/v) H₃PO₄. The formed methylselenol was trapped as described above.

Glutathione Disulfide as a Substrate of Methylselenol—The reactivity of the nascent methylselenol with glutathione disulfide was studied in a modified GHOST assay using varying concentrations of GSSG as a final substrate. GSSG was added to an assay also containing hTrxR and NADPH (200 μM) after the reduction of methylseleninate was complete. The formed GSH (in an assay containing 1 μM methylselenolate and 50 μM GSSG) was confirmed using DTNB ad 1 mM, which yields 1 TNB per thiol/selenol group. Prior to the addition of the DTNB, 2 μM of auranofin was added to eliminate the reduction of DTNB by TrxR (15, 27). The change in absorbance at 412 nm (ε₄₁₂ nm TNB 13.6 mM⁻¹ cm⁻¹) was determined and compared with a GSSG-free control sample treated alike. Relevant glutathione reductase contaminations were ruled out.

Methylseleninate, a New Substrate of Human TrxR

FIG. 3. Incubation of hTrxR with methylseleninate and NADPH under aerobic and anaerobic conditions. The solid lines represent the absorbance at 340 nm obtained under anaerobic conditions with 23 and 47 μM methylseleninate. The dash-dotted lines resulted from the incubation under aerobic conditions using 23, 47, and 68 μM methylseleninate (top to bottom). Methylseleninate was added at time = 0. The drawn parallel lines indicate the continuous NADPH consumption under aerobic conditions, which is independent of the methylseleninate concentration in the concentration range used. The 1:2 (methylseleninate:NADPH) stoichiometry can be calculated from the ΔA under anaerobic conditions.

![Figure 4](#fig4)
FIG. 4. Kinetic trace of the methylselenol-mediated reduction of glutathione disulfide. In a cuvette (total assay volume, 1 ml) containing 100 μM NADPH in T buffer, 9 nM human thioredoxin reductase subunit was added. In the first experiment (dash-dotted line), GSSG (50 μl) was then added ad 1 mM. The lack of a significant NADPH consumption indicates the absence of a relevant amount of glutathione reductase in the thioredoxin reductase enzyme sample. After a few minutes, methylseleninate was added ad 2.5 μM. This initiated the reduction of GSSG by the formed methylselenol. If methylseleninate was added prior to the GSSG (solid line), only a stoichiometric NADPH consumption for the reduction to methylselenol can be detected. The addition of GSSG ad 1 mM led again to a stoichiometric consumption of NADPH. The assays were carried out under aerobic conditions.

result in the expected consumption of NADPH due to the reduction of the substrate. The above continuous reaction was slightly enhanced if the experiment was started with very low concentrations of methylseleninate. This indicated that a compound with a low concentration was rate-limiting. As judged from the absorbance at 340 nm, the reaction stopped immediately if auranofin ad 100 nM was added. Neither catalase nor superoxide dismutase did alter the reaction. Human TrxR treated with 200 μM NADPH and 5 mM methylseleninate did not exhibit increased NADPH oxidase activity (e.g. NADPH + H⁺ + O₂ → NADP⁺ + H₂O₂) after extensive dialysis if compared with enzyme treated alike but in the absence of methylseleninate. We therefore concluded that the product methylselenol reacted with oxygen (e.g. CH₃Se⁻ + O₂ → CH₃SeO₂⁻), giving rise to an oxidation product, which again is a substrate of TrxR. In an anaerobic assay, we confirmed that NADPH consumption was equal to methylseleninate-free control after the calculated consumption of NADPH required for the full reduction of methylseleninate had taken place (Fig. 3).

The TrxR/Methylselenolate System Efficiently Reduces Glutathione Disulfide—It is noteworthy that methylseleninate, in the absence of reduced glutathione, is virtually not a substrate for glutathione reductase (less than 0.05% of GSSG reduction activity). We found that in the presence of GSSG, which in turn is not a substrate of hTrxR (35), there was a continuous consumption of NADPH after the complete reduction of methylselenolate (Fig. 4), which was stoichiometric to the amount of GSSG added. For the reduction of GSSG by CH₃SeH under steady-state conditions, a rate-constant k₂ of ~400 M⁻¹ s⁻¹ was calculated (19). In a separate experiment, we determined the concentration of thiols formed with DTNB relative to a control without GSSG addition. As determined by the formation of 2-nitro-5-thio-benzoate (TNB), 95% of the 50 μM GSSG added had been reduced to GSH by 1 μM methylselenolate whose concentration was kept constant by hTrxR. (In this experiment, it is of importance to completely inhibit hTrxR with auranofin prior to the addition of 5,5′-dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoate) (DTNB) since it is a substrate of the enzyme under these conditions.) These results are in accordance with the proposed overall reaction shown in Eq. 7,

NADPH + H⁺ + GSSG ⇌ 2 GSH + NADP⁺ (Eq. 7)

Eq. 7 is the sum of the theoretical Eqs. 8 and 9, shown below.

CH₃Se⁻ + GSSG + H⁺ ⇌ GSH + GS-SeCH₃ (Eq. 8)

GS-SeCH₃ + NADPH ⇌ GSH + CH₃Se⁻ + NADP⁺ (Eq. 9)

Eq. 8 is a spontaneous reaction. The reduction of GS-SeCH₃ (Eq. 9) is supposedly enzyme-dependent as the addition of further TrxR increased the rate of NADPH consumption indicative for an enzyme being involved. To rule out that the intermediate GS-SeCH₃ could also be cleaved by another molecule of methylselenol as depicted in Eq. 10, we tested dimethyldiselenide (CH₃Se-Se-CH₃) as a substrate of TrxR.

CH₃Se-SG + CH₃Se⁻ + H⁺ ⇌ GSH + CH₃Se-Se-CH₃ (Eq. 10)

Methylseleninate, a New Substrate of Human TrxR

If this reaction (Eq. 10) was of quantitative importance, the reduction of dimethyldiselenide by TrxR would be a prerequisite for a continuous GSSG reduction as the reaction would otherwise come to an early halt. Dimethyldiselenide did not serve as a substrate of hTrxR under our assay conditions, most likely due to the unfavorable ΔE°' of the diselenide bridge.

Reduced glutathione reduces methylseleninate quickly (29). The attempt to quantify the effects of different c(GSH)/c(GSSG) ratios failed since the reaction was too rapid to give reproducible results with higher GSH concentrations.

**Inhibitory Effects of Methylseleninate May Be Assay Artifacts—** The weak competitive inhibition found for methylseleninic acid in an earlier study (14) may be partly due to the used assay system. The \( K_m \) values of human TrxR for thioredoxin and methylseleninate are very similar (Table 1 and Refs. 22 and 35). Thus in the presence of thioredoxin and methylseleninate, the concentrations of either substrate determines the rate of reduction of the individual compounds. Methylselenol, however, reduces insulin less efficiently (~12% at equal concentration, data not shown). Because the formation of free thiols via the recycling of Trx is the principle of the insulin reduction assay, increasing methylseleninate concentrations leads to an apparent inhibition if the incubation time is short. For the DTNB reduction assay, similar considerations apply: the DTNB concentration is at least 5–20 times higher than is the \( K_m \) of 18 μM for methylseleninate (22, 35). Because the formation of TNB is recorded in the DTNB reduction assay, it is obvious that the NADPH consumption due to the reduction of methylseleninate is not monitored directly. The nascent methylselenolate, however, does react with DTNB but forms only one TNB-thiolate anion in contrast to the two produced by the enzymatic DTNB reduction. From the theoretical point of view, methylseleninate might be viewed a competitive inhibitor if DTNB is regarded as the substrate. This does not reflect a physiological situation, however.

CH₃SeO₂⁻ → 2 NADP⁺ + CH₃Se⁻ + 2 H₂O). The data obtained by LDI-TOF mass spectrometry of a silver precipitate provided clear evidence for methylselenolate as a product.

As mammalian TrxR reacts with only one NADPH per catalytic cycle (15, 22, 28), it must be concluded that the above overall reaction is the net result of two reactions as depicted in Eqs. 2 and 3. In the course of the reactions, methylseleninate, methylselenenate, and methylselenolate are present at one time or another. Since we do not observe any inhibition of TrxR activity in the concentration range used, we conclude that simple monomethylated selenium derivatives do not exert their chemopreventive effect by inhibition of TrxR. The lack of effect *in vivo* is not due to an unexpected pathway preventing the reaction. It may be argued that the TrxR-catalyzed reduction of methylseleninate and consecutive reactions are of negligible importance in the cell since GSH is present in abundance. However, similar theoretical assumptions had formerly been made for the reduction of selenite in which it has recently been shown that the depletion of reduced glutathione hardly alters the rate of selenite reduction *in vivo*, whereas NADPH is required (38). The concentration of 25 μM 1,3-bis-(2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea used in Ref. 38 was too low for a complete inhibition of TrxR (16, 22). This substantiates the finding that selenite can be efficiently reduced by TrxR to yield selenide (39).

Many studies indicate that selenium is most preventive in the early stages of a neoplastic transformation (1, 40). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered important contributors on the cellular way to tumor formation. Therefore the finding that methylselenolate is readily oxidized by H₂O₂ and to a lesser extent by other hydroperoxides such as *t*-butyl-hydroperoxide and thereby detoxifies these reactive compounds is of interest. The product of these reactions is methylseleninate (or methylselenenate), which will then be recycled to methylselenol (Eq. 1), resulting in the overall reaction identical to the reaction sequence performed by glutathione peroxidase and reductase.

Similar findings have been reported by Björnstedt *et al.* (41) with catalytically generated selenols from selenocysteine. However, the intracellular concentration of selenocysteine is considered to be low (30), and the cellular levels of selenocysteine and selenomethionine are regulated. Indeed, if the concentrations are increasing above a certain level, the selenoamino acids are metabolized to methylselenol (Fig. 1). The physicochemical properties of methylselenol are advantageous for many functions: it is a small molecule that in its protonated form (~8% at pH 6.9 using a pKₐ of 5.7) can easily pass through and act within membranes without any transport system. This is not the case for many other antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione. In the absence of oxidative stress and in the presence of a functional glutathione system, the involvement of TrxR in the maintenance of the methylselenol level may be negligible. However, under certain (patho)physiological conditions and in some compartments, TrxR-catalyzed methylselenol formation is likely to be of importance.

As the pKₐ increases in hydrophobic environments, methylselenol will further concentrate in membranes. There it may, apart from the cleavage of hydroperoxides, be capable of reducing other reactive oxygen species (CH₃SeH + "ROS" → CH₃SeO₂⁻ + H⁺ + "Non-ROS") and thereby prevent alkylhydroperoxides from being formed in the first place.²

As it can be calculated from the Michaelis-Menten equation, the CH₃SeO₂⁻ turnover is more important than the actual methylselenol concentration. The formed methylseleninate can

be assumed to exhibit a much lower pK<sub>a</sub> than methylselenol and should therefore be “expelled” from the membrane to the cytosol. It is tempting to speculate that this might explain the mutual saving effect of selenium and the lipid-protective vitamin E (42).

The antioxidative point of view is further substantiated if we take into account that our data indicate that methylselenol and TrxR are capable of functionally replacing glutathione reductase (Eqs. 7–9). Since many important pathways in the cellular metabolism, such as the detoxification of alkylhydroperoxides and the GSH conjugation of xenobiotics, are dependent on a constant flow of reduced glutathione, it is tempting to speculate that TrxR via methylselenol is capable of partially maintaining these GSH fluxes under conditions in which glutathione reductase activity is impaired. Reduced thioredoxin has already been found to exhibit an efficient glutathione reductase-like activity (20); however, Trx is very bulky in comparison to methylselenol. Thus methylselenol may perform the GSSG reduction task in environments inaccessible to Trx. The effects of TrxR and methylselenol depicted here are not solely responsible for the chemopreventive effects of selenium. Nevertheless, they provide further insight into the chemical basis of the mechanisms mediating the positive effects of selenium.
