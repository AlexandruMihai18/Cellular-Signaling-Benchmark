classical and molecular genetics. Flies and other insects grow by a series of molts in which a new and larger exoskeleton (cuticle) is synthesized by epidermal cells and the old cuticle is digested away and shed (ecdysis). Basically, the same process occurs in the metamorphosis of the larva (maggot) to the pupa and then to the adult fly. The
cholesterol directly. It is of course cholesterol that is the ultimate precursor for steroid hormone biosynthesis including ecdysone. The plant-eating insects must dealkylate the sitosterol to cholesterol (Fig. 5), which in addition to its function as a hormone precursor is an important constituent of cell membranes. This inability to synthesize the basic ringed structure of sterols is a major difference between the

After incubation of the transfected cells with the \[^3H\]ketotriol, the resulting material was analyzed by RIA, RP-HPLC as well as normal phase TLC, and found to be 2-deoxyecdysone (82.

We are currently using the above described paradigms to elucidate earlier steps in the biosynthetic pathway (e.g. C25 hydroxylation), but were also most interested in the final step in molting hormone biosynthesis i.e. the conversion of ecdysone to 20-hydroxyecdysone. That leads to the third Halloween gene whose function we have elucidated, *shade*
we have demonstrated that three of the eight mitochondrial P450s of the fruit fly are involved in steroid hormone synthesis. Fig. 5 summarizes our knowledge of ecdysteroidogenesis and denotes the reactions mediated by the products of the Halloween genes. Using the experimental paradigm described here we are confident that all the genes involved in this biosynthetic pathway will be identified in the next several years.
