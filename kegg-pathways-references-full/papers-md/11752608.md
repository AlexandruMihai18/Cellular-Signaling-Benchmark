Control of T Helper Cell Differentiation—  
in Search of Master Genes

(Published 12 September 2000)  

Naïve T helper (T_H0) cells exist in our peripheral lymphoid organs as immunocompetent precursors that, upon activation, can differentiate into one of two functional subsets that are distinguished by their cytokine production profiles and their roles in immune regulation (Fig. 1). T_H1 cells produce proinflammatory cytokines such as interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and lymphotoxin-α; effector T_H2 cells, in contrast, produce cytokines [interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-9, IL-10, IL-13, and so forth] that together instruct antiparasite and, to some extent, humoral immune responses. T helper (T_H) cell differentiation can be observed not only during in vivo immune reactions, but also can be recapitulated in vitro, when T_H cells are activated through their T cell receptors (TCRs) and costimulatory receptors (i.e., provided by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) stimulation or by anti-CD28 cross-linking). Under these conditions, addition of IL-12, normally produced by activated APCs in vivo, can strongly induce T_H1-polarized differentiation, whereas addition of IL-4 skews T_H cells to become T_H2 effectors. Facilitated by this culture system and powerful molecular cloning and mouse genetics techniques, several key transcription factors and signaling molecules that govern the T_H differentiation program have been identified over the past years.

### IL-4 Transcription Regulation

IL-4 is produced by differentiating T_H2 cells and by fully differentiated, bipotential T_H0 cells into the T_H2 pathway. IL-4 gene transcription has been extensively studied by a number of groups. The 800-base pair (bp) proximal promoter of the IL-4 gene was shown to confer T_H2 specificity in transgenic mice despite a substantially lower expression level than the endogenous gene (1). Furthermore, reporter vectors containing an IL-2 or IL-4 minimal promoter into which the NFAT-AP1 composite DNA element from the 800-bp proximal promoter has been inserted (1–3) were expressed in a T_H2-specific fashion, indicating that the NFAT and AP1 transcription factor families can regulate IL-4 gene expression. NFATc and NFATp bind to the NFAT-AP1 composite DNA site in the IL-4 promoter and activate IL-4 transcription in vitro

(4, 5). However, analysis of mice deficient in NFATc and NFATp distinguished the roles of these genes in IL-4 regulation: Mice deficient for NFATp or for both NFATp and NFAT4 have an exaggerated T_H2 response (6–8), whereas NFATc-deficient mice displayed impaired T_H2 differentiation (9, 10). Thus, NFATp and NFATc seem to play opposite regulatory roles in IL-4 regulation. Precisely why this is so remains a puzzle.

Fig. 1. Transcription factors and T_H cell differentiation. Upon activation by APC, naïve T_H cells produce IL-2, undergo clonal expansion, and become T_H0 cells, which can then differentiate into T_H1 or T_H2 effector cells. T_H1 and T_H2 cells differ in the cytokines that they produce and in the immune regulation performed. T_H1 and T_H2 differentiation is determined by several key cytokines: IL-12, produced by APC, potentiates T_H1 differentiation; IL-4, on the other hand, drives T_H2 development. Polarized T_H cell differentiation is also characterized and mediated by transcription factors expressed or by function in lineage-specific fashion. These factors include STAT4 and T-bet for T_H1 and STAT6, GATA-3, c-Maf, JunB, and NFATc for T_H2 differentiation.

GATA-3 was identified as a lineage-specific factor selectively expressed in the T_H2 pathway (11, 12). GATA-3 is present at low levels in naïve and newly activated CD4⁺ T cells. However, in differentiated T_H2 cells, GATA-3 levels are elevated (11, 12), whereas T_H1 cells have undetectable levels of GATA-3 mRNA and IL-4 gene expression. Ouyang et al. (13) found that the reduced GATA-3 expression during T_H1 differentiation is dependent on IL-12. Within the past 3 years, several studies have demonstrated that GATA-3 is the critical regulatory transcription factor involved in T_H2 differentiation. T cells isolated from transgenic mice overexpressing GATA-3 produced IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, and IL-10 mRNA when cultured under T_H1 conditions in the complete

absence of exogenous IL-4 (12). Zhang *et al.* also found that GATA-3 could activate the IL-5 promoter in vitro (11). Moreover, GATA-3 was also reported to inhibit IL-12–mediated IFN-γ production in T cells (13). On the other hand, reduction of GATA-3 function by antisense expression in cloned T<sub>H</sub>2 cells led to the extinction of IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, and IL-13 T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine gene mRNA expression and protein secretion (12). This result was recently confirmed by expression of a dominant-negative GATA-3 mutant in murine T cells, which resulted in reduced expression of the T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokines IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 (14). Arai and colleagues showed recently that retrovirally expressed GATA-3 could cause differentiated cloned T<sub>H</sub>1 cells to produce IL-4 and IL-5 (15), and Ouyang *et al.* (16), using a similar approach, found that GATA-3 overexpression in signal transducer and activator of transcription protein 6 (STAT6)–deficient cells resulted in T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine expression and the establishment of T<sub>H</sub>2-specific deoxyribonuclease I (DNase I)–hypersensitive sites in the IL-4 gene locus. Together, these experiments show that GATA-3 is the master T<sub>H</sub>2 regulatory factor both necessary and sufficient to generate T<sub>H</sub>2 responses. However, how GATA-3 works is still not understood. The proximal promoter of the IL-4 gene lacks a strongly functional GATA-3 binding site; therefore, its major role is likely to be at a T<sub>H</sub>2-specific enhancer(s) or even perhaps a locus control region outside of the minimal IL-4 gene promoter.

In addition to GATA-3, two bZIP transcription factors, c-Maf and JunB, are also expressed in a T<sub>H</sub>2-specific manner and bind to the proximal IL-4 promoter (2, 17, 18). Overexpression of c-Maf strongly induced IL-4 expression in non-T cells (18). Transgenic mice in which c-Maf overexpression was driven by the CD4 promoter exhibited enhanced T<sub>H</sub>2 responses dependent on IL-4 (19). The importance of c-Maf in controlling IL-4 expression is further strengthened by a report that *c-maf*<sup>−/−</sup> T<sub>H</sub> and natural killer T cells exhibit impaired IL-4 production (20). However, T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation and cytokine production appear normal in the absence of c-Maf, probably because of compensation by normal levels of IL-13. On the other hand, overexpression of the AP1 family member JunB in transgenic mice caused developing T<sub>H</sub>1 cells to overproduce IL-4 and IL-5 and, to a lesser extent, IL-6 and IL-10 (all T<sub>H</sub>2 products) through a synergistic mechanism involving c-Maf (17). This synergy was specific for JunB because neither c-Jun nor JunD is capable of synergizing with c-Maf.

The IL-4 gene is located on chromosome 11 in a locus containing the other T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine genes, IL-5 and IL-13, which suggests that the expression of these genes is coordinated. Two groups have identified several DNase I–hypersensitive sites in the IL-4 and IL-13 gene locus that are selectively associated with T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation (21, 22), indicating that chromatin may be remodeled during T<sub>H</sub>2 commitment, making the locus more accessible for transcription. In addition, remodeling of the IL-4 gene locus is accompanied by DNA demethylation and was shown to require both TCR and IL-4 receptor signaling (21). Loots *et al.* examined 1 megabase of human and murine DNA containing T<sub>H</sub>2-regulated genes and found several homologous noncoding sequences shared between them. Some of these sequences are conserved across several mammalian species (23). These regions could serve as candidate enhancer/locus control sequences for T<sub>H</sub>2 genes. Indeed, these investigators generated a transgenic mouse strain carrying a yeast artificial chromosome encoding the human IL-4 locus and showed that the human T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine genes could be expressed properly in these mice. Deletion of one of the conserved noncoding regions greatly reduced

the efficiency but not the T<sub>H</sub>2 specificity of gene expression, indicating that the DNA region between the IL-4 and IL-13 genes could act as an important enhancer sequence that regulates T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine expression. Agarwal *et al.* identified another putative enhancer: a DNase I–hypersensitive site located downstream of the IL-4 gene (24). In this study, they found that GATA-3 but not c-Maf bound to this enhancer; in response to TCR signaling, NFATp also bound to the site, in a cyclosporin A–inhibitable manner. Although this element is likely to support GATA-3–dependent IL-4 gene transcription, it is possible that additional GATA-3 targets exist in the locus.

Recently, two reports demonstrated that IL-4 is expressed in a monoallelic fashion. Bix and Locksley established T<sub>H</sub>2 cell clones from BALB/c × CaST/Ei F<sub>1</sub> mice and analyzed the IL-4 genes for evidence of allelic expression (25). They found that most clones expressed IL-4 in a monoallelic fashion and that the allelic pattern was transmitted as a stable epigenetic trait. In another study, Riviere *et al.* generated a mouse strain in which one allele of the IL-4 gene was replaced by the human CD2 gene (26). Using this model, they demonstrated that most T<sub>H</sub>2 cells expressed only the functional IL-4 allele or only the targeted allele. The frequency of monoallelic versus biallelic expression in this model suggests that allelic activation is a stochastic process whereby the chance of activating each cytokine gene allele can result in the generation of diverse profiles of cytokine expression and subsequent effector cell populations. In addition, Reiner and colleagues also found that IL-4 expression in T cells requires passage through more cell cycles than are required for IFN-γ expression, suggesting that rounds of cell division in concert with changing profiles of polarizing cytokines may relieve epigenetic repression (27). In contrast to differentiating T<sub>H</sub> cells, fully differentiated T<sub>H</sub> effector cells exhibit stable epigenetic modification and cell cycle–independent gene expression.

The above studies point out an interesting new direction for understanding T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine gene regulation. TCR signaling, possibly through NFATc, initiates the clonal expansion and low-level IL-4 expression by T<sub>H</sub> cells. At this stage, IL-4, produced by other regulatory cell types during immune reactions or by proliferating T<sub>H</sub>0 cells through a STAT6-dependent mechanism, increases and sustains GATA-3 expression. It is possible that GATA-3, with other lineage nonspecific nuclear factors, mediates chromatin remodeling to render the T<sub>H</sub>2 locus on one chromosome accessible to other lineage- and gene-specific factors, such as c-Maf and JunB. Increased production of IL-4 would enhance T cell proliferation and, on the other hand, might provide stronger signals to open up the additional allele.

### Regulation of IFN-γ Expression

The prototypic cytokine for T<sub>H</sub>1 cells is IFN-γ. However, in comparison to the IL-4 gene, less is known about how IFN-γ gene transcription is regulated. Agarwal *et al.* showed that, during T<sub>H</sub>1 differentiation, chromatin remodeling of the IFN-γ locus occurs (21). Penix *et al.* identified c-Jun/ATF2 sites and a series of other ATF binding sites within two functionally active elements called the proximal and distal IFN-γ elements (28, 29). Transgenic mice were generated whereby these two elements were linked to luciferase reporter constructs, demonstrating that the proximal element showed T<sub>H</sub>1 specificity, whereas the distal element did not (30, 31). In addition, Young and colleagues found an intronic enhancer in the IFN-γ gene (32). Interestingly, c-Rel was found to bind to this enhancer but not to a

similar sequence from the IL-2 promoter.

A T<sub>H</sub>1-restricted transcription factor has recently been described (33). T-bet is a T-box protein that is expressed in T<sub>H</sub>1 clones and differentiating T<sub>H</sub>1 cells. Overexpression of T-bet activates IFN-γ expression in cell lines or primary activated T cells. Even more striking, T-bet expression by retroviral transduction induced IFN-γ expression and suppressed IL-2, IL-4, and IL-5 production in differentiating and differentiated T<sub>H</sub>2 cells. Thus, T-bet appears to be a candidate T<sub>H</sub>1 master gene. The mechanism of its action and regulation remains to be solved and will no doubt provide a better understanding of T<sub>H</sub> differentiation regulation.

### Signaling Regulation and Cross-Regulation

T<sub>H</sub> cell differentiation is largely determined by the cytokine environment. Cytokine-induced receptor dimerization activates the Janus family of tyrosine kinases, which then phosphorylate and initiate the nuclear transport of STAT transcription factors. STAT6, which acts downstream of IL-4, is required for T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation (34–36). Bcl-6 was reported to compete with STAT6 for the same binding site and thus was considered to be a negative regulator of T<sub>H</sub>2 responses (37). This conclusion is supported by studies in Bcl-6-deficient mice that exhibited T<sub>H</sub>2-specific autoimmune diseases (37). Although the function of STAT6 in T<sub>H</sub> differentiation has been well established, the mechanism of its action still remains unclear. For instance, the proximal IL-4 promoter lacks a STAT binding site. One study reported that STAT6 may bind to a site in an intronic repressor and release the inhibition (38); however, whether this is the physiological function for STAT6 remains to be determined. Alternatively, STAT6 may function to regulate expression of other transcription factors involved in T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation by binding to sites in genes such as *GATA-3* and *c-maf* and by functioning to regulate their expression. Indeed, Kurata and colleagues found that retroviral expression of STAT6 can result in GATA-3 and c-Maf expression and T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine production in differentiated T<sub>H</sub>1 cells (39). On the other hand, STAT4 is activated by IL-12, and STAT4-deficient mice are profoundly deficient in T<sub>H</sub>1 cells (40, 41). How STAT4 regulates T<sub>H</sub>1 differentiation is very unclear. STAT4 may induce T-bet expression, bind to a T<sub>H</sub>1-specific enhancer to mediate chromatin remodeling, or simply antagonize STAT6 function. IFN-γ induces the expression of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II transactivator (CIITA) (42). Recently, CIITA-deficient T cells were found to have increased T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine production and exhibited differentiation skewed toward the T<sub>H</sub>2 phenotype (43), suggesting that CIITA serves as a negative regulator of the T<sub>H</sub>2 program. Thus, CIITA may provide another mechanism for T<sub>H</sub>1/2 cross-inhibition.

There are three major mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in mammals: the extracellularly regulated kinase (ERK), p38, and Jun NH<sub>2</sub>-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways. The Ras-ERK pathway has an important role in early thymocyte differentiation and selection; however, its role in peripheral T<sub>H</sub> cell differentiation was not studied until recently. Yamashita et al. used dominant-negative *Ha-ras* transgenic mice (in which ERK activation by the TCR was severely compromised) and showed that this pathway is required for T<sub>H</sub>2 differentiation (44). Similar results were found using wild-type cells treated with inhibitors against MEKs, the upstream kinases that activate ERKs. Yamashita et al. also demonstrated that the function of the ERK pathway was to enhance IL-4–induced phosphorylation of STAT6 and IL-4R, suggesting a mechanism of IL-4 signaling regulation by ERK (44).

The p38 MAPK pathway is selectively activated in mouse T<sub>H</sub>1 effector cells. Studies using imidazole inhibitors of the p38 kinases, transgenic mice expressing a dominant-negative p38α molecule (45), or mice deficient in the p38 upstream kinase MAPK kinase kinase 3 (MKK3) (46) all demonstrated that IFN-γ production by T<sub>H</sub>1 cells required p38 signaling. Consistent with these results, primary T cells expressing constitutively active MKK6, one of the upstream MEKs that activates p38 kinase, had higher levels of IFN-γ than control cells (45). Candidate downstream targets of p38 regulation are likely to include transcription factors of the ATF family.

JNK phosphorylates c-Jun and increases AP1 transcriptional activity (47). JNK activation in Jurkat tumor cells has been shown to require both TCR and CD28 ligation, and it has been suggested that JNK integrates signals from both sets of receptors to induce IL-2 expression (48). Unlike Jurkat cells, however, naive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells express only very low levels of JNK proteins and mRNA (49). Induction of JNK follows activation of primary mouse T cells, but this process is slow and peaks at ~2 or 3 days after T cell activation; over this period, there is substantial de novo synthesis of JNK protein. Thus, JNK activity correlates well with the expression of effector cytokines in both the T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 pathways but correlates poorly with the expression of the growth factor IL-2. Indeed, mice deficient for either *Jnk1* (50) or *Jnk2* (51) expression, *Jnk1<sup>−/−</sup>Jnk2<sup>−/−</sup>* mice (52), and mice lacking the MKK7 gene (whose protein product activates JNKs) (52) all exhibited defective phenotypes associated with T<sub>H</sub> differentiation but not with T<sub>H</sub> activation. JNK2-deficient mice showed impaired T<sub>H</sub>1 immune responses (51), and reduced levels of IFN-γ in *Jnk2<sup>−/−</sup>* mice appear to derive from a reduced production of the IL-12 receptor β chain (IL-12Rβ2). On the other hand, mice deficient for JNK1, both JNK1 and JNK2, or MKK7 showed an exaggerated T<sub>H</sub>2 response (50, 52). Consistent with this exaggerated T<sub>H</sub>2 response, infection of JNK1-deficient mice with *Leishmania* leads to greatly exacerbated disease with failure to heal skin lesions (53); the disease advances to ulceration in a manner similarly observed in BALB/c mice, which have a genetically determined strong T<sub>H</sub>2 response. This indicates that JNK is required in vivo and in vitro to restrict T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine expression and to maintain polarized T<sub>H</sub>1 responses. Examination of expression of T<sub>H</sub>2 transcription factors at this stage shows that JNK1-deficient mice have elevated NFATc in the nucleus (50). The mechanism whereby NFATc accumulates has now been elucidated (54). Specifically, JNK serves as an NFATc kinase, phosphorylating NFATc on two serine residues, one of which lies in the calcineurin binding site. JNK inhibits the targeting of the phosphatase calcineurin to NFATc and thus opposes NFATc nuclear translocation. In the absence of JNK signaling, NFATc is inefficiently removed from the nucleus, which results in nuclear accumulation of NFATc and excessive production of T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokines.

The p38 and JNK MAPKs are both selectively activated in T<sub>H</sub>1 cells; however, the mechanism that underlies this selectivity was not understood until recently. Li et al. found that the expression of the small guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase) Rac2 is enhanced in T<sub>H</sub>1 cells (55). Because MAPK pathways can be activated by small GTPases, we tested the hypothesis that elevated Rac2 was responsible for mediating this selective activation. Indeed, Rac2 activation increases IFN-γ transcription in vitro and in vivo in Rac2 transgenic mice through several signaling pathways, including p38. Blocking the Rac2 pathway led to the inhibition of IFN-γ production and gene transcription.

way, gene transcription patterns are established and might be transmitted epigenetically. Cells are programmed to become effector cells that use lineage-restricted transcription factors (c-Maf and JunB) and specific signaling pathways (p38, JNK, and NF-κB) and produce high levels of cytokines to orchestrate immune responses.

Real-life immune responses and mechanisms of T<sub>H</sub> cell differentiation, however, are probably much more complicated than this. In vitro culture systems have allowed the rapid identification and characterization of factors involved in T<sub>H</sub> differentiation, many of which still await “trials” of real-life immune challenges. Genetic manipulations in mice will greatly facilitate these in vivo experiments, which are compounded by numerous factors, including the nature of antigen presentation, the presence of different costimulatory factors, the physical sites of immune reactions, the production of inflammation cytokines and chemokines, feedbacks from effector cells, hormonal regulation, and so forth. Some of the in vitro findings will hold as time passes, and some will not. These types of studies will likely reveal still greater complexities of immune regulation and will ultimately provide useful therapeutics for treating immune diseases.

Rac2-deficient T cells also had reduced levels of IFN-γ.

Rac2 also mediates IFN-γ transcription by activating the inhibitor of κB (IκB) kinase–nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) pathway (55). IκB, a suppressor of NF-κB nuclear translocation, blocks Rac2-activated IFN-γ transcription in vitro, consistent with an earlier study on the human IFN-γ promoter (32). In support of this mechanism, Aronica *et al.* used transgenic mice expressing a similar IκB mutant that cannot be phosphorylated and recently demonstrated that the NF-κB pathway is required for T<sub>H</sub>1-dependent delayed-type hypersensitivity responses but not for the T<sub>H</sub>2-characterized airway hypersensitivity response (56).

### Future Perspective—Is Everything Known Yet?

Much knowledge and insight has been gained from the past 10 years of intensive study. It appears that after T cell activation, there is chromosomal remodeling of cytokine gene loci that is likely mediated by transcription factors, including the NFAT and AP1 family, which results in low levels of cytokine expression and leads to the so-called T<sub>H</sub>0 stage. At this stage, different environmental factors and cytokines activate signaling pathways culminating in the activation or suppression of transcription factors such as T-bet and GATA-3 that regulate the development of T<sub>H</sub>1 or T<sub>H</sub>2 cells, respectively (summarized in Fig. 2).
