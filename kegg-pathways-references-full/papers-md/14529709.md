### Abstract

Phosphorylation of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit GluR1 at Ser${}^{845}$ enhances AMPA channel activity. This study demonstrates that Ser${}^{845}$ is rapidly dephosphorylated upon AMPA receptor activation in nucleus accumbens slices. AMPA-induced dephosphorylation at Ser${}^{845}$ was blocked by CNQX, an AMPA receptor antagonist, by nifedipine, an L-type Ca${}^{2+}$ channel antagonist, or by cyclosporin A, a calcineurin inhibitor. N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) treatment also decreased phosphorylation of Ser${}^{845}$, an effect that was blocked by MK-801, an NMDA receptor antagonist, but not by nifedipine. Accumbens neurons are enriched for dopamine- and cyclic AMP (cAMP)-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32), a potent inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1) when phosphorylated by PKA (at Thr${}^{34}$). We tested the hypothesis that the AMPA/KA or NMDA-stimulated dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 via calcineurin, leading to increased PP1 activity and dephosphorylation of GluR1. AMPA or NMDA treatment decreased phospho-Thr${}^{34}$-DARPP-32 levels, effects that were blocked by receptor antagonists, or cyclosporin A. However, dephosphorylation of Ser${}^{845}$ mediated by AMPA or NMDA receptors was unaffected in DARPP-32/inhibitor-1 knockout mice. These data suggest that AMPA- or NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser${}^{845}$ occurs by a mechanism that is independent of DARPP-32 and PP1, but involves activation of calcineurin. Thus, Ca${}^{2+}$-dependent dephosphorylation of GluR1 may serve as a negative feedback mechanism for the regulation of AMPA receptor activity in neurons.

### 1. Introduction

The neostriatum, including the dorsal striatum and the nucleus accumbens, plays a critical role in regulating functions as diverse as the control of motor activity (Albin et al., 1989) and the development of drug addiction (Nestler,

2001). Ascending dopamine (DA)-containing neurons from the midbrain innervate the predominant cell type of the striatum and nucleus accumbens, the medium spiny-type neuron (Kemp and Powell, 1971). DA, released from these neurons, modulates the excitability of medium spiny neurons in response to glutamate, released from afferents from the cortex and other brain regions.

Three subtypes of ligand-gated ion channels, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), (±)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), and kainate subclasses, mediate actions of glutamate in the brain (Hollamnn and Heinemann, 1994). Each of these receptor subtypes is expressed in medium spiny neurons of the striatum and nucleus accumbens (Petralia and Wenthold, 1992; Martin et al., 1993; Tallaksen-Greene and Albin, 1994; Ghasemzadeh et al., 1996; Bernard et al., 1997).

AMPA receptors, in particular, are believed to mediate a large proportion of glutamatergic excitation of medium spiny neurons (Cepeda et al., 1993). Phosphorylation of the GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor at Ser845 by cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) (Roche et al., 1996) and at Ser831 by protein kinase C (PKC) or Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) (Barria et al., 1997) enhances the activity of AMPA channels. Moreover, the increased phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 (Snyder et al., 2000) in response to D1-type DA receptor activation has been implicated in the enhancement of AMPA receptor currents in medium spiny neurons (Yan et al., 1999). The ability of DA to regulate both GluR1 phosphorylation and AMPA channel activity requires the inhibition of protein phosphatase 1 (PP1), a major protein serine/threonine phosphatase in the brain. Inhibition of PP1 activity is mediated via a biochemical cascade involving the phosphorylation by PKA of dopamine- and cyclic AMP (c-AMP)-regulated phosphoprotein, Mr 32,000 (DARPP-32), a protein that is highly enriched in medium-sized spiny neurons (Ouimet et al., 1984). DARPP-32, when phosphorylated by PKA on a single threonine residue (Thr34), is converted into a potent inhibitor of PP1 (Hemmings et al., 1984). As a result, DARPP-32 plays a critical role in regulating the excitability of medium spiny neostriatal neurons through its functional regulation of a number of cellular effectors. In addition to AMPA receptors, these include voltage-dependent Ca2+ and Na+ channels, the electrogenic ion pump Na+, K+-ATPase, and NMDA and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (Fienberg et al., 1998; Greengard et al., 1999; Snyder et al., 2000; Flores-Hernandez et al., 2000).

It has been shown that activation of NMDA receptors in a model of hippocampal long-term depression (LTD) results in a marked dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 (Lee et al., 1998) suggesting that glutamate-induced dephosphorylation of GluR1 may be a critical mechanism for regulating the functional activity of AMPA receptors. Activation of NMDA receptors on striatal neurons has been shown to increase Ca2+ influx into neurons (MacDermott et al., 1986), leading to the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 by calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase (Halpain et al., 1990). The aim of the present study was to determine whether glutamate, via activation of NMDA and/or non-NMDA subclasses of glutamate receptors, might also regulate the dephosphorylation of GluR1 in neostriatal neurons and whether this might involve DARPP-32 and PP1.

2. Methods

2.1. Materials

(±)-α-Amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid hydrobromide (AMPA hydrobromide), 6-cyano-7-
nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione, disodium salt (CNQX), N-methyl-D-aspartate, D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP-5), and MK-801 hydrogen maleate were obtained from Research Biochemicals, Inc. (Natick, MA) and Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO). Nifedipine and cyclosporin A were purchased from Alexis Biochemicals (San Diego, CA). Goat anti-mouse IgG was purchased from Pierce, nitrocellulose membrane (0.2 μm pore size) from Schleicher & Schuell, ECL reagent from Amersham, and X-ray film from DuPont. Experiments involving animals were conducted in accordance with the IACUC guidelines.

2.2. Tissue preparation and drug treatment

In most experiments, male Sprague-Dawley rats (150–250 g) were used. In some experiments, male mice (C57B1/6mix with 129SvJ, 8–12 weeks in age) bearing targeted disruptions of the genes for both DARPP-32 and protein phosphatase inhibitor 1 (and their wild-type littermates) were used (Fienberg et al., 1998; Allen et al., 2000). The animals were killed by decapitation and the brain was rapidly removed to an ice-cold surface. The brain was blocked and mounted with adhesive to the cutting base of a vibratome (TPI, Inc.) and submerged in ice-cold (4°C), oxygenated Mg2+-free Krebs bicarbonate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 124 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 26 mM NaHCO₃, 1.25 mM CaCl₂, 1.25 mM KH₂PO₄, and 10 mM D-glucose. Coronal slices of the brain (400 μm in thickness) were cut and pooled in cold Krebs buffer. Sections of nucleus accumbens (containing core and shell regions) were dissected from the surrounding tissue (Pellegrino et al., 1979) under a dissecting light microscope, pooled in fresh buffer, then transferred individually to ice-cold 4-ml polypropylene tubes containing 2 ml of fresh oxygenated Krebs buffer. The buffer was then replaced with a fresh solution and the tubes transferred to a 30°C water bath and connected to a manifold providing constant aeration with a 95% O₂/5% CO₂ mixture. After 30 min, the buffer was replaced with fresh solution and the tissue slices incubated for an additional 1–30 min in the absence (control) or presence of test substances. At the end of this incubation period, the solution was rapidly aspirated from each tube and the remaining tissue slice was immediately frozen on dry ice. Tissue sections were stored at –80°C until analyzed.

2.3. Analysis of phospho-Ser845 GluR1 and phospho-Thr34 DARPP-32

Frozen tissue slices were homogenized by sonication in boiling 1% SDS, then boiled for an additional 10 min at 100°C. The protein concentration of each sample was determined (Lowry et al., 1951). One hundred fifty microgram of total protein of each sample were diluted

with an SDS-polyacrylamide (PAGE) sample buffer containing (final concentration) 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 6.7, 10% glycerol, 2% SDS, 10% 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.01% bromophenol blue. The proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE on 12% polyacrylamide gels (Laemmli, 1970), then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes (Towbin et al., 1979).

Nitrocellulose membranes were immunoblotted for the detection of specific phosphorylated forms and total levels of GluR1 and DARPP-32. Antibodies used to detect the phospho-Ser845 form of GluR1 (1/500 dilution) and total levels of GluR1 (1/5000 dilution) have been characterized previously (Kameyama et al., 1998). A monoclonal antibody (mAB-23) (1/750 dilution) generated against the phosphorylated form of rat DARPP-32 phosphorylated on Thr34 has also been described previously (Snyder et al., 1992). The level of total DARPP-32 protein was analyzed using a monoclonal antibody (C246a) (1/10,000 dilution), raised against DARPP-32, which does not differentiate between phospho- and dephospho-forms of the protein (Hemmings and Greengard, 1986).

For immunoblotting, the nitrocellulose membranes were blocked for 30–60 min in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, 124 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 10 mM Na₂HPO₄, and KH₂PO₄, pH 7.2) containing 5% non-fat dry milk and 0.2% Tween-20 (Blotto). The membranes were then incubated for 2 h in Blotto with primary antibody, then rinsed three times (10 min each) with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20. The final rinse solution was replaced with Blotto containing goat anti-mouse HRP-linked IgG (1/6000 dilution) and the membranes were incubated for an additional 30 min. They were then rinsed several times (10 min/rinse) with PBS containing 0.2% Tween-20 and antibody binding was detected using ECL followed by exposure to X-ray film. Phospho-GluR1 and phospho-DARPP-32 immunoreactivity was quantitated by analysis of scanned films using NIH 1.52 Image software. Levels of phospho-GluR1 and phospho-DARPP-32 were normalized for the total amount of GluR1 or DARPP-32, respectively, in each sample prior to further statistical analysis.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845: calcineurin-dependence

The regulation of phosphorylation of Ser845, a site that controls channel open time probability (Roche et al., 1996), was examined in nucleus accumbens slices. The GluR1 subunit of the AMPA receptor was detected as a band of Mr~106 kDa in homogenates of rat nucleus accumbens (Fig. 1A). A basal level of phosphorylation was detected in untreated slices. Treatment of slices with

Fig. 1. Effect of AMPA on the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845. (A) Rat nucleus accumbens slices were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of a Mg²⁺-free buffer containing AMPA (100 μM) for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with phospho-Ser845 of GluR1 and total GluR1 (C-terminal) being detected using specific antibodies. The blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the data shown in the bar graph are expressed as a percentage of the level detected in control slices. The data are expressed as means ± SEM for three experiments (*p < 0.05 compared with control, Mann-Whitney U-test). It should be noted that cross-reactive bands (~120 kDa) are detected by the phospho-Ser845 antibody in nucleus accumbens homogenates. These bands are well resolved from that corresponding to phospho-Ser845 GluR1 and did not interfere with quantitation of phospho-GluR1 levels. (B) Rat nucleus accumbens slices were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A (5 μM) (Cyc A), at time 0. After 55 min of incubation, either normal Mg²⁺-free buffer or buffer containing AMPA (100 μM) was added for 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above using antibodies specific for phospho-GluR1 and total GluR1. The blots were analyzed by densitometry and the data shown in the bar graph expressed as a percentage of the level detected in control slices. The data are expressed as means ± SEM for three experiments (*p < 0.05 compared with control, Mann-Whitney U-test).

AMPA, an agonist at AMPA and kainate subclasses of glutamate receptors, promoted a rapid dephosphorylation of Ser845 without affecting the level of GluR1 protein (Fig. 1A). The effect of AMPA on the basal level of Ser845 phosphorylation was fully blocked by preincubation of slices with CNQX, an AMPA/kainate-type

receptor antagonist (Table 1), indicating that GluR1 dephosphorylation was mediated by selective ligand-dependent activation of AMPA and/or kainate-type receptors.

The possible role of the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase, calcineurin, in AMPA-induced GluR1 dephosphorylation was tested by preincubating nucleus accumbens slices with the calcineurin inhibitor, cyclosporin A. Pretreatment of accumbens slices with cyclosporin (5 μM) blocked AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of Ser⁸⁴⁵ (Fig. 1B). Cyclosporin A treatment alone did not significantly increase the basal phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser⁸⁴⁵ suggesting that under the conditions used in these experiments there is little basal calcineurin activity. These data are consistent with previous results (Snyder et al., 2000).

### 3.2. AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser⁸⁴⁵: absence of role of NMDA receptors

AMPA-induced depolarization of neurons might be expected to release NMDA receptors from Mg²⁺ block and result in increased Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptor channels leading to activation of calcineurin. To assess whether Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptors is necessary for AMPA-induced regulation of Ser⁸⁴⁵, the ability of an NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801, to block AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of GluR1 was evaluated. Pretreatment of accumbens slices with MK-801 did not significantly affect the basal phosphorylation of GluR1. MK-801, at a concentration that blocked

NMDA responses in this system (see below), failed to prevent AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of Ser⁸⁴⁵ (Table 1).

### 3.3. L-type Ca²⁺ channel blockade: effect on AMPA receptor phosphorylation

We next evaluated the possibility that Ca²⁺ influx through L-type Ca²⁺ channels mediated the dephosphorylation of GluR1 in response to AMPA treatment. Incubation of slices with nifedipine, a blocker of L-type Ca²⁺ channels, increased the basal phosphorylation of Ser⁸⁴⁵ by about twofold (untreated slices: 49 ± 12% of Nifedipine alone) (Fig. 2). Treatment of slices with AMPA resulted in dephosphorylation at Ser⁸⁴⁵ (100 μM AMPA: 15 ± 5% of nifedipine alone) without altering total levels of GluR1 protein. In addition, nifedipine pretreatment fully blocked the dephosphorylation at Ser⁸⁴⁵ in response to AMPA (100 μM nifedipine + 100 μM AMPA: 106 ± 38% of nifedipine alone).

### 3.4. Effect of AMPA/KA receptor activation on dopamine-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32

Previous studies demonstrated that the phosphorylation and activity of AMPA receptors is regulated in part

Rat nucleus accumbens slices were preincubated in normal Krebs' buffer (Control) or in a buffer containing MK-801 (100 μM) or CNQX (20 μM) for 10 min, then incubated for an additional 5 min in the absence or presence of AMPA (100 μM). For each sample, the level of phospho-Ser⁸⁴⁵ GluR1 was analyzed by densitometry, and normalized for the total amount of GluR1. The results, means ± SEM, are expressed as percentage of the level in the control slices for four experiments.

Rat nucleus accumbens slices were preincubated in the absence (control) or presence of nifedipine (Nifed, 100 μM) for 10 min. Slices were then incubated in the absence or presence of AMPA (100 μM) for an additional 5 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Phospho-Ser⁸⁴⁵ levels were analyzed and normalized for total GluR1. Data are expressed as a percentage of the level detected in control slices.

by the DARPP-32/PP1 cascade (Yan et al., 1999; Snyder et al., 2000). The present results further indicate that the decrease in GluR1 phosphorylation caused by AMPA is due to activation of calcineurin. Since activation of calcineurin would catalyze the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴, resulting in deinhibition of PP1, it seemed possible that dephosphorylation of Ser⁸⁴⁵ of GluR1 might be mediated via regulation of the DARPP-32/PP1 cascade.

Dopamine (100 μM) induces a rapid and transient increase in the phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴ in accumbens slices. Pretreatment with AMPA (100 μM) completely blocked DA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴ (23 ± 8% of DA alone; Fig. 3). Lower concentrations of AMPA (1–10 μM) also blocked DA-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴ (data not shown). The decrease in the phosphorylation of Thr³⁴ was not due to any change in the level of DARPP-32 protein (Fig. 3). Pretreatment of slices for 60 min with CNQX (100 μM) alone (or in concentrations ranging from 10 to 100 μM, data not shown) had no significant effect on the basal levels of phospho-Thr³⁴-DARPP-32 in nucleus accumbens slices (untreated control: 13 ± 1% of DA alone; CNQX: 9 ± 3% of DA alone, Fig. 3 and data not shown). Although, CNQX pretreatment alone produced an apparent reduction in DA-stimulated phosphorylation at Thr³⁴, this effect was not statistically significant (CNQX + DA: 73 ± 30% of DA alone, Fig. 3). CNQX did, however, block the ability of AMPA (100 μM) to decrease DA-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 (DA + AMPA + CNQX: 54 ± 10% of DA alone; CNQX + DA: 73 ± 30% of DA alone).

One explanation for the effect of AMPA on DA-mediated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 is that AMPA activates calcineurin. Preincubation with cyclosporin A did not significantly affect the basal phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴ (control: 11 ± 4% of DA alone; cyclosporin A: 20 ± 6% of DA alone, Fig. 4). Cyclosporin A treatment did not significantly affect DA-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr³⁴ (5 μM cyclosporin A + DA: 135 ± 20% of DA alone). Incubation of slices with cyclosporin A prevented the decrease in Thr³⁴-phosphorylation induced by AMPA (5 μM cyclosporin A + DA + AMPA: 102 ± 12% of DA alone; DA + AMPA: 34 ± 5% of DA alone, Fig. 4), suggesting that AMPA-mediated dephosphorylation at Thr³⁴ is mediated by activation of calcineurin.

### 3.5. Absence of effect of NMDA receptor antagonists on the AMPA-induced reduction in dopamine-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32

As shown above, AMPA treatment blocked the dopamine-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴ and this action was prevented by CNQX (Fig. 4). In con-

**Fig. 3.** CNQX, an AMPA receptor antagonist, blocks AMPA-induced inhibition of DA-stimulated DARPP-32 phosphorylation. Rat nucleus accumbens slices were preincubated without or with CNQX (100 μM) for 60 min, then incubated for 1 min with DA alone (100 μM) or DA in the presence of AMPA (100 μM) for 1 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. (A) Phospho-Thr³⁴ of DARPP-32 (top panel) and total DARPP-32 (lower panel) were detected with specific antibodies. (B) Data are expressed as a percentage of the level detected in slices treated with DA alone, and are shown as means ± SEM for three experiments (*p < 0.05 compared with DA alone, Student's *t*-test). Total GluR1 levels were not significantly affected by AMPA treatment (*p* = 0.15, Student's *t*-test).

Contrast, AMPA's ability to block dopamine-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 was unaffected by the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 (100 μM; Table 2A). AP-5 also failed to prevent the AMPA-induced reduction in dopamine-stimulated phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr³⁴ (100 μM AP-5; Table 2B). Neither MK-801 nor AP-5 affected DA-stimulated phosphorylation of Thr³⁴-DARPP-32 (Table 2).

Rat nucleus accumbens slices were preincubated with or without MK-801 (100 μM) (A) or AP-5 (100 μM) (B) for 10 min, then incubated for 1 min with DA alone (100 μM) or DA in the presence of AMPA (100 μM) or NMDA (100 μM). In each sample, the amount of phosphorylated DARPP-32 was analyzed by densitometry, and normalized to the total amount of DARPP-32 in the tissue slice. The data were then normalized to the level of phospho-Thr³⁴ DARPP-32 measured in slices treated with DA alone. Data represent means ± SEM for six (A) or three (B) experiments.

Rat nucleus accumbens slices were preincubated in normal Krebs buffer (control) or in a buffer containing MK-801 (100 μM). for 10 min, then incubated for an additional 5 min in the absence or presence of NMDA (100 μM). For each sample, the level of phosphor-Ser845 GluR1 was analyzed by densitometry, and normalized for the total amount of GluR1. The results, means ± SEM, are expressed as a percentage of the level in the control slices for four experiments.

Slices were then incubated with DA (100 μM) alone or with DA in the presence of AMPA (100 μM) for 1 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. Phospho- and total DARPP-32 levels were detected with specific antibodies (upper panels). These data were normalized to values obtained for slices incubated with DA alone. Data represent means ± SEM for five experiments and are expressed as a percentage of DA alone (\( *p < 0.01 \) compared to DA alone; \( ^{+}p < 0.05 \) compared to DA + AMPA, Student's t-test).

### 3.8. Effect of NMDA on Ser845 GluR1 and Thr34 DARPP-32 phosphorylation

Treatment of slices with NMDA also resulted in dephosphorylation of Ser845 (Fig. 7), an effect mediated by calcineurin (data not shown). NMDA treatment had no effect on the level of GluR1 protein in neostriatal homogenates (Fig. 7A). The NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801 (Table 3) or AP-5 (data not shown), each blocked NMDA-induced dephosphorylation of Ser845 but failed to block the effects of AMPA (Table 1). Nifedipine failed to block NMDA-induced dephosphorylation at Ser845 (100 μM nifedipine ± 100 μM NMDA: 19 ± 9% of nifedipine alone) (data not shown) suggesting that Ca2+ entry via NMDA receptors is sufficient to mediate the effect of NMDA.

As previously reported (Halpain et al., 1990; Nishi et al., 1997), NMDA treatment prevented dopamine-induced phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr34. This action of NMDA was reversed by the NMDA antagonists MK-801 (100 μM MK-801 + DA + NMDA: 98 ± 6% of DA alone; DA + NMDA: 22 ± 8% of DA alone) and AP-5 (data not shown; see also Halpain et al., 1990). NMDA-mediated dephosphorylation at Thr34 was not significantly reduced by nifedipine pretreatment (100 μM nifedipine + DA + NMDA: 18 ± 6% of nifedipine

### 4. Discussion

The present study demonstrates that the activation of AMPA/kainate subclass of glutamate receptor, an expected result of D1-mediated phosphorylation of GluR1, induces a rapid dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser845 and of DARPP-32 at Thr34. However, dephosphorylation of GluR1 in response to AMPA did not appear to require regulation of PP1 activity. This conclusion is based on the inability of calyculin A, at concentrations that are known to block most PP1 activity in slices, to prevent AMPA-induced dephosphorylation. More importantly, AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of Ser845 of GluR1 was unaffected in nucleus accumbens slices from mice bearing a double knockout of the genes for the two known PP1 inhibitors in this brain region, DARPP-32 and I1.

The selective activation of NMDA-type glutamate receptors also led to dephosphorylation of DARPP-32, an effect previously reported in neostriatal neurons (Halpain et al., 1990), and to GluR1 dephosphorylation. NMDA-dependent GluR1 dephosphorylation at Ser845 in neostriatal slices was also fully blocked by cyclosporin A, and was unaffected by knockout of DARPP-32 and I1. These data are consistent with those of a previous study (Ehlers, 2000) showing that GluR1 dephosphorylation at Ser845 occurs in response to NMDA in cortical neurons.

Fig. 6. Effect of DARPP-32/I1 double gene knockout or pharmacological inhibition of PP1 on the AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser<sup>845</sup>. (A) Mouse nucleus accumbens slices were prepared from normal wild-type C57Bl/6 mice or mice bearing a knockout of the genes for DARPP-32 and I1 (D-32/I1 KO). Slices were incubated in the absence (C) or presence of AMPA (100 μM) for 1–15 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above using an antibody specific for Ser<sup>845</sup> phospho-GluR1 (top panel). The blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the data shown in the bar graph represents means ± SEM for five experiments and is expressed as a percentage of control (lower panel) (*p < 0.05, compared with control, Student's *t*-test). (B) Mouse nucleus accumbens slices prepared from normal C57Bl/6 mice were preincubated with calyculin A (Calyc) under conditions (0.5 μM for 60 min) that have been shown to block about 75% of all PP1 and PP2A activity in slices (see Nishi et al., 1999). At the end of preincubation, the drug solution was replaced with a fresh one containing calyculin A and AMPA (100 μM) for an additional 1–15 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above. The blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the data shown in the bar graph represent means ± SEM for six experiments and are expressed as a percentage of control (*p < 0.05 compared with control, Student's *t*-test; †*p < 0.05 compared with calyculin A alone, Student's *t*-test). Note that calyculin A treatment also increased the immunoreactivity of an unknown cross-reactive band at ~120 kDa.

receptors and mediates a calcineurin-dependent down-regulation of GluR1 receptor currents (Tavalin et al., 2002). Whereas, our present data and the results from Tavalin et al. support a prominent role for calcineurin in glutamate receptor-coupled dephosphorylation, they do not preclude a significant additional contribution of PP1 to the dephosphorylation of Ser<sup>845</sup>. Previous work by Ehlers (2000) supports the idea that both calcineurin and PP1 participate in NMDA-mediated regulation of Ser<sup>845</sup> phosphorylation in cortical neurons. In the present study, treatment of slices with calyculin A resulted in an increase in phosphorylation of Ser<sup>845</sup>, reflecting most likely the action of basally active PP1. Moreover, D1-receptor-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser<sup>845</sup> is attenuated in neostriatal slices from DARPP-32 knockout mice (Snyder et al., 2000). A role for PP1 in the regulation of AMPA receptors during synaptic plasticity is also supported by a study demonstrating that PP1 blocking peptides inhibit LTD in hippocampal neurons, but fail to affect basal synaptic currents mediated by either AMPA or NMDA receptors (Morashita et al., 2001). Taken together, these and other data (Yan et al., 1999) suggest that, at least in neostriatum (and probably in other types of neuron), regulation of PP1-mediated dephosphorylation plays a critical role in facilitating enhancement of AMPA receptor phosphorylation and activity, whereas calcineurin exerts a significant role in mediating AMPA receptor dephosphorylation and inactivation in response to glutamate.

AMPA-type and NMDA-type glutamate receptors appear to mediate GluR1 dephosphorylation, in part, via distinct pathways. AMPA-type glutamate receptor channels are permeable to Na<sup>+</sup> ions, but relatively imper-

Fig. 7. Effect of NMDA on the phosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser<sup>845</sup> and DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>34</sup>. Mouse nucleus accumbens slices were prepared from normal wild-type C57B1/6 mice (A–C) or D32/I1 double knockout mice (C). (A) Slices were incubated in the absence (control) or presence of NMDA (100 μM) for 1 min. Samples were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting as described above using antibodies specific for Ser<sup>845</sup> phospho-GluR1 and total C-terminal GluR1. (B) Slices from wild-type mice were incubated in the absence (C) or presence of nifedipine (Nifed, 50 μM) for 10 min, then for an additional 1 min with NMDA (100 μM) and/or DA (100 μM). Samples were analyzed by immunoblotting using antibodies specific for Thr<sup>34</sup> DARPP-32 and total DARPP-32 (upper panels). The blots were analyzed by densitometry, and the data shown in the bar graph represent means ± SEM for five experiments and are expressed as a percentage of DA alone (*p < 0.05, compared with DA alone, Student's t-test). (C) Slices prepared from wild-type and D32/I1 knockout mice were incubated in the absence or presence of NMDA (100 μM) for 1–15 min.

meant to Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions (Hollmann et al., 1991), in contrast to NMDA-type receptor channels which are highly permeable to Ca<sup>2+</sup> (MacDermott et al., 1986). The ability of cyclosporin A to prevent dephosphorylation of GluR1 at Ser<sup>845</sup> and DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>34</sup> induced by either AMPA (present study) or NMDA (Nishi et al., 1997) indicates that both classes of ionotropic glutamate receptors are coupled to activation of calcineurin. However, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> necessary for dephosphorylation of GluR1 and DARPP-32 in neostriatum is apparently recruited via different mechanisms by AMPA/kainate and NMDA receptors. AMPA-induced dephosphorylation of Ser<sup>845</sup> of GluR1 or Thr<sup>34</sup> of DARPP-32 is blocked by nifedipine, but not by NMDA receptor antagonists. Thus, Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx responsible for AMPA-induced dephosphorylation occurs through L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels. This conclusion is consistent with the report that in striatal neurons, AMPA-dependent phosphorylation of the nuclear transcription factor, CREB, requires L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Rajadhyalsha et al., 1999). In contrast, AMPA-dependent CREB phosphorylation is also blocked by NMDA receptor antagonists (Rajadhyalsha et al., 1999), whereas the AMPA-dependent dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 is not. The basis for this differential involvement of NMDA receptors in the regulation of CREB and DARPP-32 phosphorylation by AMPA is not known. However, there are several major differences in the two studies that could contribute to this. These include differences in the phosphoprotein studied (a nuclear transcription factor vs. a cytosolic inhibitor), the effector molecule (a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent kinase vs. calcineurin), and the tissue preparation (cultured striatal neurons vs. nucleus accumbens slices).

The phosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>75</sup> by cdk5, a cyclin-dependent kinase family member, converts the protein into an inhibitor of PKA in vitro and in vivo (Bibb et al., 1999). Treatment of striatal slices with AMPA or NMDA has recently been shown to catalyze the dephosphorylation of DARPP-32 at Thr<sup>75</sup>. This effect, in contrast to the calcineurin-dependent regulation of Ser<sup>845</sup> on GluR1 and Thr<sup>34</sup> on DARPP-32, is fully abolished by blockade of PP2A (Nishi et al., 2002). Thus, AMPA/KA and NMDA receptors regulate multiple phosphorylation sites on DARPP-32 through multiple protein phosphatases. Taken together, these data suggest that the stimulation of AMPA/KA receptors can control two distinct (and often opposing) functions of DARPP-32: stimulating PP1 activity, by dephosphorylating Thr<sup>34</sup>, and increasing PKA activity, by dephosphorylating Thr<sup>75</sup>. These diverse actions of glutamate receptors, mediated by regulating the effects of distinct protein phosphatases on DARPP-32, may contribute to explaining the fact that DA and glutamate can have either opposing or synergistic actions on a variety of different functions of medium spiny neurons (Halpain et al., 1990; Rajadhyalsha et al., 1999).

In conclusion, the present results suggest that AMPA receptor-stimulated, calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of GluR1 represents a negative feedback mechanism for the regulation of AMPA receptor activity in neostriatal neurons. This effect is independent of both DARPP-32 and I1 and of Ca²⁺ influx through NMDA receptor channels. These data posit that AMPA receptors, stimulated by glutamate, mediate a calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation of GluR1, whereas D1-type receptors, stimulated by DA, stimulate GluR1 phosphorylation via regulation of the DARPP-32/PP1 signaling cascade (Greengard et al., 1999). This hypothesis is supported by a recent study showing that calcineurin-mediated effects on GluR1 serve as a biochemical mechanism for the down-regulation of GluR1 currents in hippocampal neurons (Tavalin et al., 2002). In addition, another report has shown that Ca²⁺ influx, an expected result of Ser⁸⁴⁵ phosphorylation of GluR1, stimulates the accumulation of AMPA receptors at the neuronal membrane of hippocampal neurons (Borgdorff and Choquet, 2002). Thus, it is possible that the ability of AMPA receptor stimulation to regulate GluR1 phosphorylation via Ca²⁺-dependent dephosphorylation may also be involved in the regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking.
