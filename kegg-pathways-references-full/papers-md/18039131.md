**Abstract**

Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation and injury of the myocardium. Several viruses have been associated with myocarditis in humans. However, coxsackievirus B3 is still considered the dominant etiological agent. The observed pathology in viral myocarditis is a result of cooperation or teamwork between viral processes and host immune responses at various stages of disease. Both innate and adaptive immune responses are crucial determinants of the severity of myocardial damage, and contribute to the development of chronic myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy following acute viral myocarditis. Advances in genomics and proteomics, and in the use of informatics and biostatistics, are allowing unbiased initial evaluations that can be the basis for testable hypotheses about virus pathogenesis and new therapies.

INTRODUCTION

Myocarditis is clinically defined as cardiac disease associated with inflammation of the myocardium and necrosis and/or degeneration of adjacent myocytes in the absence of an ischemic event (1, 2). Infectious agents are the most common cause of myocarditis worldwide. In Central and South America, myocarditis is highly associated with Chagas disease caused by *Trypanosoma cruzi*, whereas viruses are the primary infectious agents in North American and other developed countries (3). More than 20 common viruses, including coxsackieviruses, adenoviruses, influenza viruses, cytomegaloviruses, and human immunodeficiency virus, have been associated with myocarditis in humans (4). However, coxsackieviruses are considered the dominant cause of myocarditis, particularly in neonates and young children (5–8).

The true incidence of myocarditis is not clear, largely because of its insidious nature and the consequent asymptomatic, subclinical, and misdiagnosed cases. Early knowledge of the epidemiology of myocarditis came from postmortem studies. In the late 1970s, introduction of endomyocardial biopsy provided clinicians and scientists with a useful diagnostic tool to assess the possibility of myocarditis in living patients (9). Thereafter, the Dallas histological criteria were introduced to address the problem of discrepancies in diagnostic evaluation of endomyocardial biopsies for myocarditis in the context of a large clinical trial (1, 10). The Dallas criteria for histopathological diagnosis of myocarditis have been accepted for quite some time (10, 11). These criteria include categories of acute (inflammation with myocyte damage), borderline (inflammation without damage), and persistent (repeatedly observed inflammation and damage on serial biopsies), as well as healing and healed processes (2, 8).

Examination of endomyocardial biopsy samples from patients with new-onset congestive heart failure has revealed a wide-ranging incidence of 0% to 67% for myocarditis (12–14). The inconsistencies are most likely due to differences in host ethnic and genetic backgrounds, susceptibility to infection, virus epidemiology, sampling errors, variable application of the standardized histological criteria, and the lack of unanimity among pathologists as to what constitutes myocarditis (15). However, despite the low sensitivity of detection, endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of myocarditis.

Analysis of studies between 1968 and 1975 has concluded that almost 52% of myocarditis occurs in children and young adults (under 40 years), 14% in those aged 40 to 59 years, and only 5% in patients over 60, indicating that susceptibility to viral myocarditis is likely age related (16). Other factors including sex, nutritional status, and pregnancy may also contribute to susceptibility to viral myocarditis (17–19). Young children, particularly infants under six months of age, are extremely sensitive to enteroviral infections. Myocarditis is the cause of approximately 20% of sudden unexpected deaths among young children (20, 21).

Common clinical presentations of viral myocarditis vary from febrile illness with flu-like symptoms and/or gastrointestinal illness to ventricular dysfunction and congestive heart failure with a poor prognosis. The acute form with multi-organ dysfunction is more common in neonates and young children, whereas adult patients usually present with a smoldering form of disease, and only a few present with acute myocarditis (22). Almost one-third of patients with viral myocarditis develop a chronic form of disease, at times associated with viral persistence and progressing to end-stage dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and heart failure (Figure 1).

Clinicopathological classification suggested for viral myocarditis includes the following:

1. Fulminant myocarditis, with the symptoms of left ventricular dysfunction and

unexpected heart failure within 2–3 weeks of the onset of viral infection. Those who survive may have complete resolution of myocarditis and left ventricular abnormalities.

2. Subacute myocarditis, with moderate left ventricular dysfunction and less distinct symptoms that are considered a predisposing condition for DCM.

3. Chronic active myocarditis, with moderate left ventricular dysfunction and indistinct symptoms that are typically a precursor to more restrictive cardiomyopathy. Endomyocardial biopsy may reveal ongoing inflammation, myocardial damage, and active scar tissue (active or borderline myocarditis).

4. Chronic persistent myocarditis, with normal left ventricular function and frequent palpitation or atypical chest pain as frequent symptoms. The persistence of inflammation is noticeable in biopsy examinations. On occasion, a viral genome can be detected in biopsy samples using in situ hybridization and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (23, 24).

Therapy for myocarditis is aimed mostly at symptoms and signs of heart dysfunction, and

www.annualreviews.org • Pathogenesis of Viral Myocarditis 129

is dependent upon the etiology and presenting symptoms. When a patient presents symptoms and signs of end-stage DCM, supportive therapy and/or heart transplantation must be considered. Myocarditis and DCM typically have rather dismal outcomes. The five-year survival in biopsy-proven myocarditis/DCM is approximately 50%. Specific antiviral drugs for viral myocarditis have been developed and evaluated. Antiviral drugs such as Isoxazoles (WIN54954) and Pleconaril (VP63843) are broad-spectrum capsid function inhibitors that block enterovirus uncoating and have been shown anecdotally to have beneficial effects (25, 26). Pleconaril, an experimental drug, which was available on a compassionate case basis, binds the hydrophobic pocket in viral capsid protein 1 (VP1), inhibiting enteroviral attachment and entry. A few clinical trials using Pleconaril in children and adults were reported to decrease severity and duration of symptoms in patients with enteroviral meningitis and upper respiratory tract infections (27).

Thus far, attempts to design a fully effective vaccine for enteroviral infections have not been completely successful. An ideal vaccine must provide maximum immunogenicity (high production of immunogenic viral epitopes) while minimizing vaccine-related pathogenesis (very limited virus replication). To achieve such goals, scientists have explored different strategies including the use of several live attenuated viruses, DNA and RNA vaccines, and inactivated virus particles, all of which, so far, have provided only partial protection against the disease (28–33). The existence of six serotypes of coxsackievirus B (CVB), three of which (CVB1, CVB3, CVB5) are particularly cardiovirulent, makes the development of effective vaccines more challenging. A multivalent chimeric vaccine incorporating these three strains may increase the efficacy of the potential vaccine, especially in extremely susceptible groups including neonates, infants, and young children.

**EXPERIMENTAL MURINE MODELS OF VIRAL MYOCARDITIS**

Much of our understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms contributing to the onset and progression of human viral myocarditis is based on studies of experimental murine models. The mouse has become an excellent and well-defined model for viral myocarditis owing to various characteristics such as the genetic similarity to humans, easy and cost-efficient handling/breeding, availability of transgenic strains, and sensitivity to cardiotropic viruses. Susceptible mouse strains (*A.BY/Snj* & *SWR/j*) develop ongoing myocarditis as represented by the sustained presence of viral RNA within the myocardium, whereas more resistant strains (*C57BL/6j* & *DBA/1j*) eliminate the virus after the early acute phase. Comparison of disease progression and prognosis among various mouse strains has shed light on the importance of host genetic background and the extent of immune responses in the severity of disease. When inoculated into suckling, weaning, and adolescent mice, CVB3 replicates in the heart, pancreas, spleen, and brain, causing clinical symptoms that resemble human diseases (Figure 2) (34–36). In susceptible mice, following intraperitoneal injection of CVB3, three distinct immunovirological and pathological phases of disease have been characterized (Figure 3).

During the acute viremic stage, a high titer of virus is present in the blood, spleen, pancreas, and myocardium. Prominent virus replication within three to four days postinfection leads to early virus-induced cardiomyocyte injury, focal dying myofibers (both necrotic and apoptotic), multivesicular vacuolation, and calcification in the absence of myocardial inflammatory infiltrates (37). The myocardial expression of cytokines interleukin-1α (IL-1α), IL-1β, IL-6, IL-18, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), TNF-β, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) is elevated prior to immune cell infiltration (up to day 5

postinfection), indicating that these cytokines are likely released by cells intrinsic to the myocardium, such as cardiomyocytes, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and dendritic cells, in response to the virus (38, 39). Neutralizing antibodies also appear around day 4 postinfection and play critical roles in limiting viral replication in the heart and other organs (40).

The subacute phase of disease evolves with the release of progeny virus into the interstitium, which stimulates the migration of natural killer (NK) cells and macrophages to the sites of injury, followed by a considerable increase in proinflammatory cytokines and a second wave of infiltration of immune cells, including antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes. At this stage, extensive virus

Three distinct phases of murine viral myocarditis. In the experimental mouse model, three distinct phases of viral myocarditis have been characterized. The acute viremic stage is characterized by prominent virus replication in blood and infected tissues. Within the myocardium, acute myocyte damage and tissue calcification are detectable in the absence of inflammatory infiltrates. Initial release of cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-α, interferon-γ, interleukin-1β, and interleukin-2 in infected heart attracts macrophages and natural killer cells to the sites of injury. During the subacute stage, progeny virus released into the interstitium stimulates a considerable increase in lymphocytic infiltration and inflammatory cytokine release within the infected heart. The beginning of tissue clearance of viral particles and multifocal inflammatory lesions are the highlights of this stage of myocarditis. In the chronic phase of myocarditis, viral particles are typically absent in blood and peripheral tissues. Alternatively, persistent viral genome and immune infiltrates may contribute to long-term tissue degeneration and progression of viral myocarditis to dilated cardiomyopathy and congestive heart failure.

Infection is associated with the development of multifocal inflammatory lesions. In both DBA/2 and BALB/c mice, the virus is cleared by day 14 postinfection, whereas the neutralizing antibody titer reaches the highest level. The importance of neutralizing antibodies and the role of B-cell-mediated immunity have been established by observations that prednisolone-induced suppression of neutralizing antibodies in encephalomyocarditis-virus-infected BALB/c mouse can delay virus clearance in infected tissues and increase damages (41).

NK cells, likely activated by IL-2, kill virus-infected cardiomyocytes in an attempt to limit virus dissemination (42). The protective role of NK cells has been investigated in studies using NK-deficient mice, wherein increased viral titers and myocardial injury were observed in comparison with the control group (43). However, overactivation and/or long-term presence of NK cells may exacerbate myocardial damage owing to excessive release of cytotoxic molecules such as perforin within the myocardium. Perforin heterozygous (+/-) and homozygous (-/-) knockout mice infected with encephalomyocarditis virus or CVB3 have a lower level of myocardial necrosis and lymphocyte infiltration on day 12 after viral inoculation (44). Expression of proinflammatory cytokines in the heart and plasma is associated with a

major infiltration of antigen-specific T lymphocytes (39, 45). The cytotoxic T lymphocytes target viral antigens presented on the surface of infected cardiomyocytes in association with major histocompatibility complex I antigens (46). IFN-γ and TNF-α participate in the process by (a) upregulation of major histocompatibility complex I antigens on the surface of infected cardiomyocytes, and by (b) providing the proper cell-cell contact between T lymphocytes and infected myocytes via the upregulation of intracellular adhesion molecule-1 on the surface of infected myocytes (47). The involvement of T cell subsets differs among various strains of mice and appears to be an important determinant of host susceptibility to viral myocarditis. In a series of experiments using experimental models, Huber and colleagues (48) reported a correlation between host susceptibility and increased T cell responses, particularly those expressing the γδ T cell receptor.

The chronic phase of myocarditis (days 15–90 postinfection) usually begins in immunocompetent hosts with a complete clearance of progeny viruses from the blood and peripheral tissues. However, viral RNA and capsid protein VP1 may persist in the heart, spleen, and lymph nodes as reported in both humans and experimental mouse models (49, 50). As the inflammatory response subsides, increased healing, interstitial fibrosis and calcification, ventricular dilation, and cardiac hypertrophy become evident (36, 51). Alternatively, continual viral replication and immune cell infiltration within the heart may be responsible for the long-term tissue obliteration and more rapid progression of viral myocarditis to DCM and congestive heart failure. Persistently infected cells are localized mainly within chronic inflammatory lesions. Sustained expression of various cytokines has been reported during the chronic stage of viral myocarditis in humans and murine models (52, 53). Expression of the regulatory cytokine IL-18, proinflammatory cytokine TNF-α, and immunosuppressive/fibrogenic cytokine tumor growth factor-β in mouse

heart on days 28 and 98 postinfection are indications of chronic inflammatory infiltrates and an ongoing wound-healing process within the myocardium (54).

**MOLECULAR BIOLOGY OF CVB3 INFECTION**

Coxsackieviruses are nonenveloped human-pathogenic enteroviruses in the family of Picornaviridae. They are omnipresent, transmitted by the fecal-oral route, and frequently cause small seasonal epidemics around the world (55). There are two serogroups, A and B, with 23 known Coxsackie A serotypes causing mainly enteric diseases, and six known Coxsackie B serotypes (1–6) associated with severe diseases of the heart, pancreas, and central nervous system (56). All six serotypes of CVB (CVB1–6) cause a wide range of ailments, including febrile illness, aseptic meningitis, myocarditis, pancreatitis, and possibly insulin-dependent (type 1) diabetes mellitus (16). The serotype CVB3 has been consistently reported as the predominant cause of myocarditis and has been implicated in approximately 20%–40% of sporadic cases of acute onset heart disease or DCM (55, 57, 58). More recently, CVB2 and CVB4 sequences were also isolated from the hearts of patients with heart muscle disease (Keshan syndrome) in a selenium-deficient area in China (59). In infants, all Coxsackie B serotypes can cause severe systemic disease, which is typically fatal.

**CVB3 Entry and Tissue Tropism**

To initiate a productive infectious cycle, CVB3 binds to the membrane protein decay-accelerating factor (DAF) as a primary attachment protein (coreceptor) and the coxsackievirus and adenovirus receptor (CAR) as an internalization receptor. DAF (CD55), a 70-kDa membrane glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein, is widely expressed in human tissues (60). DAF has four contiguous short consensus repeats (SCR1–4) linked to a GPI-anchored C-terminal domain.
Through the GPI anchor, DAF interacts with the Src-family protein tyrosine kinase, p56<sup>lck</sup> kinase, which reportedly plays a critical role in CVB3 infection in T lymphocytes and in virus-induced myocardial injury (61, 62).

CAR is a transmembrane protein associated with tight junctions in human epithelial cells and comprises an extracellular domain composed of two immunoglobulin-like motifs, D1 and D2, a transmembrane α-helical domain, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic tail (63). The cytoplasmic and transmembrane domains of CAR are not required for virus binding, whereas the extracellular domain is necessary and sufficient for a productive coxsackievirus and adenovirus infection (64). In an experimental model of CVB3 myocarditis (*A/f* mouse), administration of soluble recombinant CAR and/or DAF (as an Fc fusion protein) attenuates CVB3-induced myocarditis and virus replication if given early in the infectious period (65–67).

As noted, in polarized intestinal epithelial cells, CAR is localized to tight junctions and is not accessible to virus approaching from the apical surface. CVB3 uses a highly sophisticated strategy to open the tight junctional barrier and gain access to the hidden receptor (CAR). Apparently, the virus hijacks the GPI-anchored DAF-mediated tyrosine signaling and actin cytoskeleton remodeling mechanism to move along the apical membrane of epithelial cells, pushing the virus/DAF complex toward the tight junctions. An elegant study by Coyne & Bergelson (68) revealed that DAF and lipid raft clustering by CVB3 results in activation of the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Abl and Src-family kinase Fyn. The former is responsible for actin polymerization and remodeling required for virus movement, whereas the latter phosphorylates caveolin-1, which promotes virus internalization into endocytic vesicles at the tight junctions.

Northern blot analyses of human tissue extracts have confirmed CAR mRNA expression in the heart, brain, pancreas, prostate, and testis, and a lower expression in liver, lung, and intestine, which is generally consistent with the pattern of tissue susceptibility and clinical presentations in CVB3 myocarditis (69, 70). A significant decrease in CAR expression in mouse heart and brain with increasing age indicates an age-related pattern of tissue tropism and host susceptibility for CVB3 (71). However, the expression pattern of CAR may not sufficiently explain CVB3 tissue tropism in experimental mouse models. For example, in the *A/f* mouse model, despite high levels of CAR mRNA expression in liver, lung, and kidney, at least the latter two organs appear resistant to CVB3 infection. These observations clearly point to the existence of secondary determinants of tissue tropism, and suggest that intracellular proteins may also play critical roles in regulating viral entry and replication. Specific interactions of some mouse cellular proteins with the 5′-untranslated region of CVB3 have already been reported (72).

### CVB3 Life Cycle

CVB3 encompasses a 7.4-kb single-strand positive-sense RNA genome. The single-strand RNA comprises a large open reading frame flanked on both 3′ and 5′ termini by untranslated regions. At the 5′ end, a small virus-encoded protein, VPg (3B), replaces the usual eukaryotic 7-methyl guanosine cap structure (73). Viral VPg protein is crucial for the initiation of postentry RNA and protein synthesis.

Following the attachment to the CAR/DAF complex and virus uncoating, viral positive-sense RNA enters the cytoplasm and serves as a template for the translation of a large viral polyprotein via a cap-independent mechanism, utilizing the internal ribosomal entry site (Figure 4) (74). The newly synthesized polyprotein is subsequently cleaved into three primary precursor molecules, P1, P2, and P3, by virus-encoded proteases 2A<sup>pro</sup> and 3C<sup>pro</sup>. The P1 portion will be further cleaved by 3CD<sup>pro</sup> to make the structural capsid proteins VP1, VP2, VP3, and VP4, while the P2 and P3 segments will make nonstructural viral proteases and polymerases (2A<sup>pro</sup>, 2B, 2C,

Following the attachment, internalization, and virus uncoating, viral positive-sense RNA enters the cytoplasm and serves as a template for translation of a large viral polyprotein via a cap-independent mechanism. The newly synthesized polyprotein is subsequently cleaved into several functional and structural proteins with various functions. Among them, viral 3Dpol, a virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, utilizes the positive-sense RNA as a template to generate negative-sense RNA strand intermediates that are subsequently used as secondary templates for the synthesis of multiple copies of positive RNA strands. The positive RNA strands are packed and released as progeny viruses to initiate new rounds of infection.

protein, two crucial components of host cell mRNA translation and protein synthesis machinery (79, 80). Viral 2A<sup>Pro</sup> also induces apoptosis by activating both extrinsic (caspase-8-mediated caspase-3 cleavage) and intrinsic (Bid-cleavage-mediated mitochondrial cytochrome c release) apoptotic pathways (81). Protease 2A further contributes to virus-induced myocardial injury through cleavage and disruption of cytoskeletal proteins dystrophin and dystrophin-associated glycoproteins α-sarcoglycan and β-dystroglycan in both in vitro and in vivo models (82).

Viral protease 3C reportedly cleaves and inactivates numerous transcription factors, including cAMP response element binding protein, octamer-binding transcription factor, cellular TATA-binding protein, and the histone protein H3, leading to profound shutdown of the host cell transcriptional and translational machinery (83–85). It also induces apoptosis through upregulation of Bax

and cleavage of Bid, resulting in the release  
of cytochrome c from mitochondria into the  
cytoplasm of infected cells (81). Viral 3D<sup>pol</sup>, a  
virally encoded RNA-dependent RNA poly-  
merase, utilizes the positive-sense RNA as  
a template to generate negative-sense RNA  
strand intermediates that are subsequently  
used for synthesis of multiple copies of pos-  
itive RNA strands (86). Viral 3D<sup>pol</sup> initi-  
ates RNA synthesis by generating the protein  
primer VPg-pU-pU (uridylylation), which is  
required for the initiation of RNA synthesis  
at the 3′ poly(A) region of a viral genome  
(87). A single negative-sense RNA can pro-  
duce several copies of positive stands. Hence,  
at any given time, the ratio of positive to neg-  
ative RNA strands is between 30:1 and 50:1  
(88). The positive RNAs are packed and even-  
tually released as progeny viruses to initiate  
new rounds of infection. The actual mecha-  
nism underlying virus release is not well un-  
derstood. There is evidence that viral pro-  
tein 2B may increase the permeability of the  
plasma membrane and facilitate the release of  
progeny viruses (89, 90). Polioviruses carrying  
a 2B mutation exhibit defects in RNA ampli-  
fication and viral release in cell culture (91).

**PROPOSED MECHANISMS FOR**  
**VIRUS-INDUCED MYOCARDIAL**  
**INJURY**

Despite the availability of a well-characterized  
experimental model and common acceptance  
of the fact that CVB3 causes myocarditis, the  
actual mechanisms underlying pathogenesis  
remain controversial. Three suggested mech-  
anisms include the following:

1. excessive immune-mediated destruc-  
tion of the myocardium by infiltrating  
immune cells targeting virus-infected  
cardiomyocytes, which frequently ex-  
tends to the remote uninfected region,  
2. autoimmune-mediated destruction of  
cardiac cells by circulating autoantibod-  
ies and/or autoreactive immune cells  
or by immune-mediated obliteration  
of cardiomyocytes due to molecular  

mimicry between viral and host anti-  
genic epitopes, and  
3. direct virus-induced cardiomyocyte  
injury.

**Immune-Response-Mediated**  
**Myocardial Injury**

During the early course of infection, tran-  
sient and self-limited release of cytokines ini-  
tiates a protective and healing process within  
the heart. However, sustained expression of  
proinflammatory cytokines in addition to per-  
sistent infiltration of sensitized immune cells  
into the heart may have detrimental effects,  
even in remote uninfected areas of the my-  
ocardium, contributing to injury and re-  
modeling of the heart. Thus, both innate  
and acquired immune responses, initiated as  
host mechanisms to eradicate the insulting  
virus while maintaining normal cardiac struc-  
ture and function, may coincidentally con-  
tribute to DCM and congestive heart failure  
(Figure 6).

Woodruff & Woodruff (92) provided the  
first evidence of inappropriate and destructive  
cellular immune responses by demonstrating  
that depletion of T lymphocytes using irradi-  
ation or antithymocyte globulin significantly  
decreased immune infiltrates and mortality  
rate in an experimental model of CVB3 in-  
fection. The elimination of both CD4<sup>+</sup> and  
CD8<sup>+</sup>T cell populations in *A/f* mice has been  
shown to markedly reduce inflammatory infil-  
trates and mortality. Interestingly, the absence  
of either CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> cells alone had no  
significant effect on disease progression in this  
model (93).

Following a few promising reports on the  
use of the immunosuppressive drug pred-  
nisolone to treat viral myocarditis, several  
studies have evaluated the value of immuno-  
suppressive therapy in human myocarditis  
(94, 95). However, two large randomized con-  
trolled trials, Myocarditis Treatment Trials  
(96–98) and the European Study of Epidemi-  
ology and Treatment of Cardiac Inflamma-  
tory Disease (99, 100), failed to show any

Immune-mediated myocardial injury in viral myocarditis. During the course of viral myocarditis, antigen-specific immune responses, preceded by innate immune activation, contribute to the progression of virus-induced myocardial injury. In the initial stage of infection and following virus release into the interstitium, viral particles are recognized by the Toll-like receptors on the surface of antigen presenting cells, in turn triggering the production of several proinflammatory cytokines through the activation of the nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) transcription factor. The proinflammatory cytokines also play an important role in recruiting immune cells into the sites of injury and amplifying the chronic inflammatory response within the myocardium. Within the first week of virus infection, antigen-specific T cells (CD8⁺ and CD4⁺) and B cells infiltrate the infected heart. T cells become fully activated by viral antigens presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II and costimulatory molecules on the surface of antigen presenting cells. Cytotoxic T cells (CD8⁺) eventually recognize fragmented viral antigens presented by MHC class I on the surface of infected cardiomyocytes. The cellular adhesion molecules on the surface of infected myocytes allow cell-to-cell contact. Activated CD8⁺ cells can lyse infected myocytes, contributing to the destruction of myocardial tissue organization and constituency. It has been suggested that cardiac myocyte destruction may result in the exposure of cardiac antigens, leading to the initiation of autoimmune responses in the infected host.

significant beneficial effects of immunosuppressive drugs on primary end points, such as heart transplantation or death (101). Furthermore, a meta-analysis of studies published from 1984 to 2003 based on a systematic review of the impact of immunosuppressive therapy in children with acute myocarditis reported that such therapy does not significantly improve the outcome of disease (102).

However, immunomodulation strategies—enhancing antiviral immune responses or targeting destructive effects of proinflammatory cytokines during the course of myocarditis—have proven more promising. Administration of IL-10, a cytokine that decreases the production of proinflammatory cytokines, had protective effects in viral myocarditis (103). Recently, a single center phase II clinical trial revealed that administration of IFN-β in patients with enteroviral and adenoviral myocarditis or DCM, for a period of 24 weeks, significantly improved cardiac function in almost 60% of the study population (104). The mechanism of action of IFN in the disease is not known.

### Autoimmune-Mediated Myocardial Injury

Myocardial injury may originate from an adverse immune response against self-antigens. Virus-mediated injury of infected cardiomyocytes probably leads to modification, exposure, or release of antigenic epitopes usually secluded from the immune system (105, 106). Early evidence for such deleterious effects was provided by the detection of autoantibodies against cardiac myosin heavy chain, β-adrenergic receptor, laminin, and mitochondrial adenine nucleotide translocator in the sera of patients with myocarditis and DCM (107–110). Furthermore, transfer of myocardial antigen-specific T cells isolated from the peripheral blood of myocarditis patients induced heart disease in SCID mice (111). In SWR/Ola mice, CVB3 infection increases expression of IgG autoantibodies against cardiac myosin heavy chain, tropomyosin, actin,

desmin, heat shock protein 60 (HSP60), and HSP70 on day 7 postinfection (112, 113). Recently, using immunoelectron microscopy, Takata et al. (114) showed that IgM autoantibodies against cardiac actin and HSP60 are localized on the cardiomyocyte membrane after repetitive CVB3 infection.

There is also evidence, albeit limited, to support the hypothesis of antigenic mimicry in viral myocarditis (115). Antigenic mimicry between epitopes on cardiac muscle cells and virus particles may perpetuate a strong immune response from sensitized B and T lymphocytes. Antibodies against cardiac α-myosin and the cardiomyocyte sarcolemma have been detected in the heart and sera of myocarditis patients and have been shown to cross-react with Coxsackie B viruses (116). Very recently, an experimental model of autoimmune myocarditis was established in which intraperitoneal inoculation in BALB/c mouse with heart-passaged CVB3-containing virus and cardiac myosin causes inflammatory heart disease very similar to autoimmune myocarditis (117). Note that almost 5% of patients with ischemic heart disease are also positive for autoantibodies against cardiac tissue (107–110). Thus, the relation between the autoantibodies and pathophysiology of viral myocarditis has proven elusive.

### Direct Virus-Induced Myocardial Injury

The hypothesis of direct virus-induced injury has been supported by numerous studies demonstrating that virus replication results in myocardial cell death during the early phase of myocarditis both in vitro and in vivo (37, 118–123). Microscopic evaluation of tissues from mice shortly following infection (3–5 days postinfection) clearly indicates that cardiomyocytes are injured prior to immune cell infiltration of tissue (37). In SCID mice, which lack mature T and B lymphocytes, CVB3 infection induces extensive myocardial injury (124). Transgenic mice with cardiac-specific

expression of the replication-restricted
full-length CVB3 cDNA (CVB3ΔVP0)
present with left and right atrial enlargement,
cardiomyocyte hypertrophy, and abnormal
excitation-contraction coupling comparable
to that observed in a pressure-overload
model of cardiomyopathy (125, 126). Loss
of cardiac myocytes and excessive scar for-
mation are the major foundations for tissue
remodeling, which contributes to ventricular
dysfunction and heart failure. CVB3-induced
cardiomyocyte apoptosis is present in various
murine models of viral myocarditis (123, 127,
128). Using biopsy tissues, cardiomyocyte
apoptosis has also been reported in human
myocarditis and in DCM associated with
viral infection (129–131).

In tissue culture, virus replication results
in cellular shrinkage and rounding, as well as
detachment of adherent cells from the cul-
ture dish. Following postentry viral trans-
lation, several proteases are released within
the cytosol that target structural and func-
tional proteins necessary for cellular home-
ostasis. Cleavage of cellular proteins results
in a rapid and complete shutdown of host
RNA transcription and protein translation,
events thought to be responsible for observed
cytopathic effects, myofibrillar disarray, and
atrophic phenotype in viral myocarditis
(Figure 7). Viral proteases further contribute
to morphological changes and cytopathic phe-
notype through cleavage of cytoskeletal pro-
teins such as dystrophin and the dystrophin-
associated glycoproteins α-sarcoglycan and
β-dystroglycan in both experimental and hu-
man myocarditis (82, 132–134).

CVB3-induced cytopathic effects precede
apoptotic events characterized by cleavage
of multiple members of the caspase fam-
ily including caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8,
and -9 (120, 135). Activated caspase-3, in
turn, cleaves downstream substrates poly
(ADP-ribose) polymerase and DNA frag-
mentation factor, resulting in inhibition
of DNA repair and initiation of oligonu-
cleosomal DNA fragmentation, two major
late events in virus-induced apoptosis (120).


Caspase-3 cleavage may occur through ei-
ther extrinsic (receptor-mediated) or intrin-
sic (mitochondria-mediated) pathways. The
release of mitochondrial cytochrome c has
been demonstrated during CVB3 infection
and it is considered the major upstream ac-
tivator of caspase-9 and -3 in CVB3-infected
cells (Figure 8) (135). Note that inhibition
of virus-induced cytochrome c release and
caspase cleavage causes no measurable al-
teration in virus-induced cytopathic effects
while significantly blocking apoptotic mor-
phology and virus progeny release, suggesting
that apoptotic phenotypes and virus-induced
cytopathic effects are probably two distinct
phenomena (135).

**HOST SIGNALING**
**DETERMINANTS OF CVB3**
**PATHOGENESIS**

Intracellular signal transduction is the foun-
dation of cellular homeostasis that allows cells
to monitor and detect intracellular and extra-
cellular changes and mount an appropriate re-
sponse. Defects in or overreaction of such reg-
ulatory systems are thought to be the cause or
effect of various human diseases.

Alterations in protein phosphorylation in
CVB3-infected cells were first documented by
Kandolf and colleagues in 1997 (136). CVB3
infection in HeLa cells resulted in tyrosine
phosphorylation of two distinct proteins of 48
and 200 kDa around 4–5 hours postinfection.
Pretreatment of infected cells with a specific
inhibitor of Src-like protein tyrosine kinases
blocked CVB3-induced tyrosine phosphory-
lation and significantly reduced viral replica-
tion, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation
events were necessary for effective virus repli-
cation (136). Later, it was shown that CVB3-
induced cleavage of p21<sup>ras</sup> GTPase-activating
protein RasGAP resulted in phosphoryla-
tion of the mitogen-activated protein kinase
(MAPK) Erk-1/2 through a Raf-1/MEK-1-
dependent pathway (137). Early transient and
late sustained activation of Erk1/2 in CVB3
infection have been shown by numerous

Figure 7

Direct virus-induced cellular injury. In a cell culture model of coxsackievirus infection, newly synthesized viral RNA (both positive and negative strands) is detectable at 1–2 h postinfection using in situ hybridization. Following viral RNA translation, viral proteases target host cell proteins such as eukaryote initiation factor 4γ, resulting in a rapid shutdown of host RNA translation. Viral proteases further contribute to morphological changes and a cytopathic phenotype through cleavage of host transcriptional and cytoskeletal proteins. Viral protein expression is followed by the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Cytochrome c release precedes apoptotic events, which are characterized by cleavage of multiple members of the caspase family and subsequent cytoplasmic and nuclear damage. At 9 h postinfection, apoptotic bodies are detectable and progeny viruses are released into the surrounding environment.

studies both in vitro and in vivo (138–140). Evidence indicates that the early phosphorylation of Erk1/2 is a response to virus-receptor binding, whereas the late phosphorylation is dependent upon viral replication (138, 140). Inhibition of Erk1/2 by specific inhibitors significantly blocked virus replication (138, 140). However, the actual mechanism underlying such regulatory effects remains obscure. Very recently, phosphorylation of the stress-activated protein kinases JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK has also been shown to increase

in CVB3-infected HeLa cells (141). Although inhibition of these protein kinases did not affect CVB3 viral protein synthesis, inhibition of p38 MAPK, but not of JNK1/2, resulted in significant reduction of viral progeny release, caspase-3 cleavage, and host cell death (141).

Another important protein kinase involved in the regulation of cell survival and cellular homeostasis is protein kinase B, or Akt. Activated Akt is involved in various cellular processes including proliferation, metabolism, and survival. CVB3 infection results in

phosphorylation (on both threonine and ser-
ine sites) and activation of Akt in both car-
diomyocytes and HeLa cell cultures (142). In
vitro studies have shown that virus-induced
Akt activation is through a phosphatidylinos-
itol 3-kinase (PI3K)/integrin-linked-kinase-
dependent pathway (143). More importantly,

inhibition of each component of this pathway
dramatically reduces viral RNA synthesis and
replication, indicating a crucial role for this
pathway in the virus life cycle.

The potential roles of downstream ef-
fectors of the PI3K/Akt pathway have also
been at the center of attention. Akt negatively

regulates glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) through phosphorylation at the serine 9 site. GSK3-β is a serine/threonine protein kinase that was initially identified as an enzyme that inhibits glycogen synthesis through phosphorylation of glycogen synthase. Phosphorylation of GSK3-β at serine 9 inactivates the kinase, whereas phosphorylation of the kinase at tyrosine 216 increases its activity. CVB3 increases GSK3-β phosphorylation at tyrosine 216 in the early hours of infection, resulting in a significant increase in GSK3-β kinase activity. Activated GSK3-β in turn phosphorylates cytoplasmic β-catenin, targeting this protein for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome pathway. Cytoplasmic β-catenin has a critical role in regulating host cell survival by interacting with, and subsequently increasing, the transcriptional activity of the T cell factor/lymphoid enhancer factor transcription factor. Interestingly, GSK3-β tyrosine phosphorylation returns to basal level around the time that GSK3-β phosphorylation at serine 9 is augmented owing to virus-induced Akt activation (144).

CVB3 infection also induces cell-growth arrest via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of cyclin D1 in infected cells. Further study using specific proteasome inhibitors in murine cardiomyocytes revealed that the ubiquitination process had an important role in the virus

life cycle, reflected in the observation that inhibition of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway significantly reduced viral transcription and protein translation (145).

The progression of viral myocarditis to DCM is associated with a profound alteration of extracellular matrix structure within the infected heart. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), in the family of zinc endopeptidases, have an important role in maintaining the normal structure of the extracellular matrix by regulating the degradation of all constituents of the extracellular matrix, especially collagen and the integrity of heart matrix and cardiomyocyte alignment. Increased expression and activation of MMPs, particularly MMP2 and MMP9, have been shown in experimental mouse models of CVB3 myocarditis (146, 147). Inhibition of MMP activity protects the mouse against myocardial injury, cardiac dilation, and heart failure, owing apparently to the significant reduction of inflammatory response and subsequent cardiac fibrosis (148).

All the recent findings highlight the importance of host signaling events in the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis and most importantly in the severity of infection and the fate of injured cardiomyocytes. Like other viruses, CVB3 has evolved various strategies to hijack or manipulate host cell signaling in an attempt to optimize the conditions for its own

Virus-induced cell death pathways. Coxsackievirus infection triggers various death-inducing pathways that collectively contribute to an apoptotic phenotype and virus-induced myocardial injury. Viral proteases cleave various structural, cytoskeletal, and translational proteins in the host cell. One example is viral protease 2A, which cleaves eukaryote initiation factor 4γ (eIF4G) and the dystrophin protein, resulting in a complete shutdown of cap-dependent RNA translation and cytoskeletal destruction in infected cardiomyocytes, respectively. CVB3 also cleaves the proapoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family Bid, leading to a dramatic change in mitochondrial membrane transition and the release of cytochrome c into the cytoplasm of infected cells. Cytochrome c release precedes apoptotic events, which are characterized by the cleavage of multiple members of the caspase family including caspases-2, -3, -6, -7, -8, and -9. Caspase-3 activation leads to the cleavage of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and DNA fragmentation factor proteins that, along with mitochondrial endonuclease G, contribute to the inhibition of DNA repair and initiation of oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation. CVB3 infection also induces the cleavage of cyclin D protein through a proteasome-dependent pathway, leading to the host cell-growth arrest. Furthermore, in infected heart, the release of several matrix metalloproteinases contributes to a profound alteration of extracellular matrix structure and affects cardiac remodeling.

benefit. Virus-conducted repertoire includes the activation of prosurvival signaling pathways during the early phase of infection to provide a short-term favorable condition for highly efficient viral RNA translation and virus replication (Figure 9). However, as the number of progeny virions increases, the virus initiates a range of antisurvival or proapoptotic mechanisms in an attempt to facilitate progeny release. Eventually, the outcome of disease is highly dependent upon the delicate balance between virus- and host-driven forces.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

Without doubt, scientists have paved a long and difficult path in their efforts to uncover mechanisms underlying the initiation and progression of viral myocarditis. Recent advances in cell and molecular biology have shed light on different aspects of pathogenesis of enteroviral myocarditis. Both direct virus-and immune-mediated injuries are believed to contribute to the development of destructive morphology in the infected heart. Successful viral replication relies on strategies that

amend host cell signaling, particularly those controlling apoptosis and survival. In addition, both innate and adaptive immune responses are crucial determinants of the severity of myocardial damage and contribute to the development of chronic myocarditis and DCM, transitioning from acute enteroviral myocarditis.

Use of differential mRNA displays (149) and cDNA microarrays (150) has provided us with the opportunity to investigate host gene responses and determine gene alterations during each distinct phase of enteroviral myocarditis. One remarkable observation is the observed global decrease in metabolic and mitochondrial gene expression in CVB3-infected mouse heart as the disease progresses from day 3 to day 9 postinfection. Considering that contractile function of cardiomyocytes depends highly upon mitochondrial energy production, this is likely one of the most sophisticated and effective strategies used by the virus to compromise ventricular function.

If utilized very carefully, and with concurrent delineation of posttranscriptional and posttranslational events, both of which are highly deregulated in virus-infected cells, high-performance techniques and bioinformatics tools can offer an unbiased initial

A multidirectional approach to solving a multifactorial entity. Virus and host genetic determinants, in addition to environmental factors, have proven important in defining host susceptibility and disease progression. Host- and virus-regulated signaling events have major roles in rebalancing cellular homeostasis or during the development of apoptotic phenotype and virus-induced cytopathic effects. Both innate and antigen-specific immune responses and possible autoimmune reactions contribute to myocardial injury and heart failure. Yet, given the complexity of factors involved in the susceptibility, initiation, progression, and ultimate prognosis of viral myocarditis, we still face a challenging puzzle. Nevertheless, advances in cell and molecular biology and functional “omics” tools, and the pursuit of a vaccine strategy for neonates, may bring further understanding and resolution of the burden this condition imposes.

Host cellular signaling determinants of viral pathogenesis. CVB3 orchestrates the simultaneous activation of a wide range of cellular signaling that contributes to the development and progression of disease. Activation of protein kinase B/Akt has been reported in a cell culture model of CVB3 infection. CVB3 activates Akt through a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/integrin-linked kinase (PI3K/ILK)-dependent pathway. The activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway [extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK1/2), p38] and a stress-activated protein kinase, c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), has also been reported. Both the MAPK and Akt pathways are crucial for virus replication, such that the inhibition of the components of these pathways markedly blocks virus replication and virus-induced cytopathic effects within infected cells. CVB3 has been shown to regulate the ERK1/2 pathway partially through the regulation of the ubiquitin/proteasome pathway. The transcriptional activity of the members of the MAPK family during CVB3 infection is not very well understood. In the early hours postinfection, CVB3 activates glycogen synthase kinase 3-beta (GSK3-β) via upstream tyrosine kinases. Early activation of GSK3-β results in the stabilization of β-catenin within the cytoplasm, targeting this protein for ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome pathway, thereby contributing to apoptotic cell death. In CVB3-infected cells, GSK3-β activation can be controlled directly by Akt and ILK. The activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) transcription factor on both in vivo and in vitro models of CVB3 infection has been reported. Yet, the mechanisms underlying, and the outcome of this activation, are not fully understood.

approach to investigating various potential metabolic, contractile, cytoskeletal, and signaling genes critical for virus pathogenesis or host defense. However, powerful mathematical and computational modeling and methods are required to simulate a comprehensive model of global gene expression and protein interactions during the course of enteroviral myocarditis. Systems biology and computational power enable the generation of hypotheses that can be experimentally evaluated.

Careful analyses of transcriptional, translational, and posttranslational alterations following virus infection may lead to the discovery of useful disease biomarkers that can be utilized to develop rapid-diagnostic tools for viral myocarditis. Such work may also identify some novel and effective therapeutic targets for antiviral therapy. Given the complexity of factors involved in the susceptibility, initiation, progression, and prognosis of viral myocarditis, we still face a challenging puzzle (Figure 10).

### SUMMARY POINTS

1. Myocarditis is a cardiac disease associated with inflammation of the myocardium and apoptotic degeneration and/or necrosis of adjacent myocytes in the absence of a localized ischemic event.
2. CVB3 is the most common etiological agent of viral myocarditis.
3. The observation that a reactive immune system may be involved in the severity of viral myocarditis highlights the importance of the balance between the protective and deleterious effects of the immune and inflammatory responses.
4. Both direct virus- and immune-mediated injuries contribute to the development of a destructive morphology in the heart.
5. If utilized cautiously, high-performance “omics” and bioinformatics/statistical tools can offer an unbiased initial viewpoint from which one can investigate various potential genes and proteins that are imperative to virus pathogenesis or host defense.

### FUTURE ISSUES

1. A high-performance experimental approach will provide us with a comprehensive model of global gene and protein expression and interactions during the course of enteroviral myocarditis.
2. Powerful mathematical and computational modeling and methods are required for simulating highly complex signaling networks and gene regulatory events.
3. Further understanding of virus-host interactions and determinants of host susceptibility will provide new insights into the development of novel preventative and therapeutic approaches.
