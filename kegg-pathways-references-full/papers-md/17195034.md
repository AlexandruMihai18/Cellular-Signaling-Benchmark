**Biologic therapies in rheumatology: lessons learned, future directions**

Vibeke Strand*, Robert Kimberly† and John D. Isaacs§

Abstract | During the past decade biologic therapies such as monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins have revolutionized the management of rheumatic disease. By targeting key cytokines and immune cells biologics have provided more specific therapeutic interventions with less immunosuppression. Clinical use, however, has revealed that their theoretical simplicity hides a more complex reality. Efficacy, toxicity and even pharmacodynamic effects can deviate from those predicted, as poignantly illustrated by the catastrophic effects witnessed during the first-into-human administration of TGN1412. This review summarizes lessons gleaned from practical experience and discusses how these can inform future discovery and development of new biologic therapies for rheumatology.

**Rheumatoid arthritis** (RA) is a chronic, destructive, inflammatory disease of the synovial membrane that lines the non-weight-bearing surface of joints, where it produces lubricating and nourishing synovial fluid. In health it comprises two cell types, macrophage-like and fibroblast-like synoviocytes, which sit on a loose, fatty, connective tissue sub-intima. In RA the synovial membrane is invaded by T and B cells — sometimes arranged into lymphoid follicles — and chronic inflammatory cells. The synoviocytes proliferate and, as disease progresses, the hyperplastic synovial tissue becomes invasive, destroying articular cartilage and underlying bone (FIG. 1)¹.

The aetiology and pathogenesis of RA remain unsolved. There is strong genetic linkage to the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region on chromosome 6 and association with the non-MHC gene **PTPN22**, a phosphatase that regulates T-cell activation². The sole environmental factor consistently associated with RA is cigarette smoking³. In some patients there are circulating autoantibodies, such as rheumatoid factor (against the Fc region of other antibodies) and anti-CCP (against citrullinated epitopes on post-translationally modified proteins), whose presence is associated with a worse prognosis⁴.

The final common pathway of joint destruction involves pro-inflammatory cytokines and tissue-destructive enzymes (matrix metalloproteinases) produced by T cells, macrophages, type B synoviocytes and bone-destructive osteoclasts. Pro-inflammatory cytokines include tumour-necrosis factor-α (**TNFα**), interleukin-1β (**IL-1β**), **IL-6**, **IL-15** and **IL-17**.

A number of cell types have been proposed to orchestrate the pathology of RA (FIG. 2). T cells provide stimulation to B cells and macrophages (FIG. 2a). In addition to soluble mediators, cell–cell contact is also important: T cell–macrophage contact is important for TNFα secretion (FIG. 2b). Conventionally, T cells are activated by dendritic cells (FIG. 2a) although it is now appreciated that B cells also secrete cytokines and chemokines, and are effective antigen-presenting cells that can maintain T-cell activation in the synovium (FIG. 2c).

**Box 1 | Lessons learned**

This review is organized into a series of four lessons, and suggests how each of these can inform future discovery and development of new biologic therapies for rheumatology.
- Lesson 1: in humans, mechanisms of action of biologic therapies can differ from those predicted. Limited insight might be provided by in vitro/ex vivo assays or preclinical studies (see page 76).
- Lesson 2: Fc regions of monoclonal antibodies and immunoglobulin fusion proteins confer multifunctionality on biologic agents; Fc–Fcγ receptor interactions can explain first-dose reactions, modulation of cell-surface antigen, clearance mechanisms and cell depletion (see page 84).
- Lesson 3: immunogenicity is a feature of all biologic agents; antiglobulins can have important clinical consequences (see page 85).
- Lesson 4: as with efficacy, observed adverse effects of biologic therapies might not be entirely predictable (see page 87).

REVIEW S

From the development and use of biologics during the past decade, several lessons have been learned: the predicted mechanisms of action of biologic therapies are difficult to confirm in *in vivo* animal models and can, in fact, be wrong; Fc regions of monoclonal antibodies and fusion proteins can have important influences on their clinical effects; immunogenicity must be anticipated with all biologic agents, although often without observable clinical consequences; and clinical benefits and adverse effects might not be entirely explicable on the basis of expected mechanisms of action. This review is organised into a series of four lessons (BOX 1), with bulleted points summarizing key lessons from basic and clinical research.

Lesson one: in humans, mechanisms of action of biologic therapies can differ from those predicted. Limited insight might be provided by *in vitro/ex vivo* assays or preclinical studies.

**Targeting T-cell-surface antigens**

Monoclonal antibodies (BOX 2) targeting T-cell-surface antigens were the first to be systematically tested in RA. Such agents were consistently tolerogenic in animal models and capable of reversing autoimmunity and transplant rejection⁶. In clinical trials in humans, however, anti-CD4, anti-CD5 and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab (CAMPATH-1H/CamPath; Berlex Oncology)) mAbs failed to provide consistent or sustained clinical benefit. Although this might have reflected a lack of T-cell involvement in the underlying disease pathogenesis, the efficacy of the recently approved co-stimulatory signal inhibitor cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4–immunoglobulin (CTLA4Ig; abatacept (Orencia; Bristol-Myers Squibb)) in RA underscores a potential role for T cells⁷,⁸. However, biologics targeting T cells raised important issues in the translation of preclinical and *ex vivo* studies to humans. Clinical trials additionally highlighted our poor understanding of immune tolerance and the need for biomarkers with which to guide therapy, topics that remain salient today.

Anti-CD4 mAbs. Murine, chimeric, humanized and ‘fully’ human mAbs to at least three different epitopes on the CD4 cell-surface antigen (ligand for MHC class II) failed to provide consistent efficacy in RA (TABLE 1). These trials demonstrated that, even when targeting the same molecule, mAbs can have distinct biological effects depending on the epitope bound, their binding affinity, and other properties attributable to both variable (V) and constant (C) regions of the mAb. Potential biological actions include downregulation of cell function via molecular blockade (‘coating’), modulation of target antigen from the cell surface, and cell depletion via clearance from the circulation (sequestration), complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) or induction of apoptosis. *In vitro* immune assays were useful for identifying some of these mechanisms of action and differentiating between specific agents, but no *in vitro* or *ex vivo* assays, or preclinical models, reliably predicted efficacy *in vivo*. Results also

Figure 1 | Cartoon of a normal joint and rheumatoid arthritis joint. In the healthy joint (a) the thin synovial membrane lines the non-weight-bearing aspects of the joint. In rheumatoid arthritis (b) the synovial membrane becomes hyperplastic and infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells. Ultimately it develops into ‘pannus’, which migrates onto and into the articular cartilage and underlying bone.

Osteoclast activation is mediated via cell membrane RANK (receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB) binding to RANK ligand (RANKL) on synovial fibroblasts and T cells, and IL-17 production by the latter cell type. Type B fibroblasts in the RA synovium have several characteristics of malignant cells, including upregulation of oncogenes and loss of contact inhibition in culture. It has been suggested that this ‘quasi-malignant’ transformation provides the primary pathogenic insult in RA (FIG. 2d).

Biologic therapies have brought new promise and opportunity to the practice of rheumatology. During the past decade, a number of novel treatments for RA have been developed, some of which have reached the clinic. They target many of the key players illustrated in FIG. 2, such as T and B lymphocytes, as well as cytokines including TNFα, IL-1β, IL-6 and IL-15. As these biologics have become broadly used, it has become clear that, despite their potential specificity and apparent simplicity, the clinical reality is more complicated. Efficacy, toxicity and even pharmacodynamic effects can deviate from those predicted. Nothing has highlighted this more poignantly than the catastrophic effects associated with a first-into-human study of the activating ‘superagonist’ anti-CD28 monoclonal antibody (mAb) TGN1412 (CD28 SuperMAB; TeGenero Immuno). When administered to healthy human volunteers TGN1412 caused multi-organ failure that was not predicted by *in vitro* or preclinical work in animal models, which suggested beneficial effects on autoimmunity⁵.

differed between non-human primate species, and failed to inform clinical responsiveness⁹. The similarity of the targeted antigen might have been insufficient to provide relevant modelling, or differing cell-surface antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells due to gender, age and environmental exposures might have altered pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic effects. In addition, changes in manufacturing processes were shown to profoundly alter the pharmacodynamics of a biologic therapy, emphasizing the subtleties of predicting *in vivo* effects (see Supplementary information S1 (box))¹⁰. It is therefore challenging to rationally predict mAb pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic measures in humans, a recurrent theme in this review¹¹.

The need for placebo-controlled trials is now well understood when testing any novel therapy in RA. In particular, parenterally administered (biologic) therapies can be associated with high expectation bias, and positive findings reported in uncontrolled trials of anti-CD4 mAbs were not usually confirmed by double-blind, randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In these latter trials, even apparent biological effects were sometimes observed in placebo groups, such as T-cell depletion in approximately 25% of patients receiving placebo in a trial of an immunoconjugate of ricin A chain and anti-CD5 mAb¹².

The lack of efficacy of anti-CD4 mAbs in RA cannot necessarily be attributed to the foregoing reasons. In animal models, tolerance induction often requires weeks to develop following prolonged administration of anti-CD4 mAbs with or without anti-CD8 (ligand for MHC class I), which is perhaps related to the size of the autoreactive T-cell population⁶. However, suitable biomarkers for the induction of immune tolerance have not been identified as a guide for translation to human studies. It was therefore not clear that any particular biological effect (depletion, coating, modulation and so on) was either necessary, sufficient or even relevant. In the absence of proven biomarkers for monitoring therapy, clinical trials might have used treatment regimens of insufficient dose or duration, and could have missed important clinical effects¹³. It is also possible that the CD4 target was too broad and included beneficial regulatory cell subsets¹⁴.

Not only did anti-CD4 mAbs fail to provide hoped-for benefits to RA patients, but unanticipated adverse effects were also observed. Administration of anti-CD4 mAbs was sometimes associated with infusion reactions, comprising low-grade fever and flu-like symptoms (TABLE 1). These were usually mild, varied between agents and were not readily predictable by *in vitro* or *ex vivo* measures. More problematic, but similarly unpredictable and unexplained, was the occurrence of skin rash and/or vasculitis with some anti-CD4 mAbs, particularly when used in high doses¹⁵. In preclinical studies anti-CD4 mAbs were particularly non-immunogenic and induced specific immune tolerance to their administration, yet immunogenicity was demonstrated in several clinical trials¹⁶.

Figure 2 | Current ideas on the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis. During the development of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) synoviocytes (particularly type B) become hyperplastic, and there is an influx of inflammatory cells. A number of micro-environments develop. **a** | Conventional antigen presentation of putative autoantigens occurs in the regional lymph nodes, but myeloid-type antigen-presenting cells (APC) are also present in the inflamed synovium. Co-stimulation is provided by B7.1 and B7.2 on the APC interacting with CD28 on the T cell, and by CD40 ligand (CD40L) on the APC interacting with T-cell CD40. CTLA4–Ig (abatacept) inhibits the former interaction. The type of immune response generated also depends on the cytokine micro-environment. Secretion IL-12 by APC favours a T~H~1 immune response with production of interferon-γ (IFNγ) and tumour-necrosis factor-α (TNFα). Recently, the combination of IL-6 and transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) has been implicated in the differentiation of pro-inflammatory T~H~17 cells that contribute to autoimmune disease²¹⁰. **b** | Macrophages interacting with activated T cells secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β. Membrane–membrane interactions are important in this cellular cross-talk, which is enhanced by T-cell stimulation with macrophage-derived IL-15²¹¹. **c** | B cells are also present in large numbers and in distinct patterns. In follicular synovitis, germinal centres develop similar to those present in lymph nodes, with B and T cells surrounding follicular dendritic cells (FDC). In aggregate synovitis, FDC are absent but T and B cells remain grouped in clusters. In diffuse synovitis, the cell types are more loosely mixed. The significance of these patterns is unclear but, supported by growth factors such as B-lymphocyte stimulator (BlyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), B cells can perform a number of roles: autoantibody production; as APC for T cells; and chemokine and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion⁵⁴,⁵⁵. **d** | One model of RA suggests that type B synoviocytes are the primary pathogenic cell and that immune mechanisms have a lesser role. Even in immune models, however, synoviocytes seem to have an active role. In part stimulated by lymphotoxin-β (LT-β, produced by B cells and other cells), they upregulate surface adhesion molecules and secrete pro-inflammatory mediators, matrix-degrading enzymes and chemokines. In this way they attract inflammatory cells into the joint and provide the niches to support the above micro-environments, while synergizing with inflammatory and destructive mechanisms²¹²,²¹³.

Box 2 | Monoclonal antibodies

Antibodies are produced by plasma cells and some memory B cells. They are complex, multi-domain adapter molecules, used by the immune system to neutralize and/or destroy invading microorganisms and their products (antigens) by uniting the antigen with various effector molecules such as complement and leukocytes bearing fragment crystallizable-γ(Fcγ) receptors. An antibody comprises two heavy and two light chains (a). At one end of the Y-shaped antibody molecule, two identical variable (V) regions have a molecular structure that is highly complementary to the target antigen. The single constant (C) region at the other end determines the fate of the bound antigen. Within the V regions, three short polypeptide segments on the heavy chain and three on the light chain form the hypervariable or complementarity-determining regions (CDRs), which dictate the precise antigen-binding characteristics of the antibody. In the three-dimensional structure of an antibody molecule, the three heavy- and three light-chain CDRs lie close together and form the antigen-binding site.

A technique for producing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) was first published by Kohler and Milstein in 1975. Antibody-producing B cells from an immunized animal were ‘fused’ to a cancer cell line, resulting in ‘hybridomas’: immortal cells that secreted antibodies of a single specificity (that is, mAbs). It therefore became possible to produce and manufacture unlimited quantities of a mAb against a desired target antigen. Subsequent application of genetic engineering techniques to genes encoding antibody V and C regions have overcome many limitations associated with traditional hybridoma technology, yielding chimeric and, subsequently, humanized and fully human mAbs. Genetic engineering has also led to the development of Fc fusion proteins in which the extracellular domain of a non-antibody ligand-binding moiety (for example, a cell-surface receptor) is fused to the hinge, CH2 and CH3 domains of an immunoglobulin C region (b).

Of most concern following alemtuzumab administration to RA patients was persistent and profound CD4 T-cell lymphopaenia²⁶. Although alemtuzumab was recognized as potently lymphocytoxic, investigators had predicted full immune reconstitution following therapy. Subsequent studies have suggested potential explanations for the prolonged lymphopaenia, such as diminished thymic function in RA and, potentially, dysregulated IL-7 production²⁷,²⁸. Similar long-term lymphopaenia has been reported following administration of depleting anti-CD4 mAbs²⁹. Impairment of innate immunity in the early alemtuzumab post-treatment period, when monocytes and NK cells were additionally depleted, was associated with two fatal opportunistic infections¹⁹–²¹. Fortunately, and surprisingly, the prolonged (and persisting) lymphopaenia has been without apparent increased mortality over 10 years of follow-up and opportunistic infections are rare in these patients³⁰,³¹. Disappointingly, synovitis returned during the period of profound peripheral blood lymphopaenia. T cells were present within the synovium at the time of relapse, however³², and oligoclonal expansions were found in peripheral blood following therapy³³. Current models suggest that antigen-driven expansion of naive and memory T cells might have compensated for mAb-induced lymphopaenia³⁴. It has been suggested that such ‘immune homeostasis’ has the potential to override peripheral tolerance mechanisms, and it is notable that up to one-third of multiple sclerosis patients developed secondary autoimmunity following therapy with alemtuzumab, most commonly of the thyroid gland³⁵. The rarity of similar phenomena in alemtuzumab-treated RA patients might reflect disordered immune homeostasis, although the reported incidence is also significantly lower in recent multiple sclerosis cohorts, and alemtuzumab continues to be developed for this indication²⁷,²⁸,³⁶.

Even administration of an IgG4 alemtuzumab mAb, unable to mediate CDC or ADCC, resulted in persistent CD4 T-cell depletion — illustrating that *in vitro* activity does not necessarily predict *in vivo* effector function³⁷. An IgG4 anti-CD4 mAb was non-depleting, reinforcing the importance of target antigen specificity for *in vivo* effects³⁸,³⁹. The subsequent recognition that IgG4 can bind the high-affinity FcγRIIIa allele of CD16 provides a potential explanation for *in vivo* depletion, and inter-individual variability of *in vitro* lytic potency⁴⁰,⁴¹.

Despite ‘humanization’, alemtuzumab retained immunogenicity, albeit less than that observed with the parent rat mAb. Recurrent administration was associated with tachyphylaxis secondary to anti-idiotypic responses capable of neutralizing mAb activity¹⁸–²⁰,⁴²,⁴³. Of interest, in some patients with haematological malignancies treated with alemtuzumab, clones of alemtuzumab-resistant, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-deficient lymphocytes arose, in a manner similar to ‘tumour escape’, resulting in a distinct and unusual form of tachyphylaxis⁴⁴.

in a selective expansion of regulatory T cells, with beneficial effects on autoimmunity and without apparent side effects^{45,46}. Even administration of the human IgG4 isotype therapeutic mAb to primates did not provide any danger signals^5. When administered to healthy human volunteers, however, TGN1412 resulted in multi-organ failure and cytokine storm — an extreme first-dose reaction. The clinical picture was highly reminiscent of that reported previously with muromonab-CD3 (OKT3/Orthoclone; Ortho Biotech), a murine mAb that recognizes the ε-chain of CD3 on human T cells, and which was used to treat episodes of allograft rejection^47. In that situation, cytokine storm was a consequence of massive T-cell activation, induced by the FcγR-mediated crosslinking of CD3^48. All six recipients of TGN1412 developed pulmonary infiltrates, renal failure and disseminated intravascular coagulation, in association with transient lymphopenia and monocytopenia^49.

It remains unclear whether this response to TGN1412, presumably also the consequence of massive T-cell activation, could have been predicted by ex vivo tests. In animal models, higher mAb doses also activated non-regulatory T cells, although without apparent detrimental effects^50. It seems likely that the extreme contrast in outcomes when TGN1412 was administered to primates and to humans reflected differences not only in binding of the mAb V region to CD28 but also different degrees of mAb crosslinking, dictated by FcγR interactions with the mAb Fc region. As a consequence of this incident, the UK Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency has stated that it will not approve any more ‘first-in-human’ tests of antibodies without first consulting ‘additional expert opinion’^51.

The six main points learned from targeting T-cell surface antigens are:
- Animal models might not predict biological effects, such as depletion (or absence thereof), efficacy or adverse events.
- Depletion of relevant cell populations can occur even with IgG4 and/or Fc-modified mAbs.
- Depletion of CD4 T cells can be long-standing, although not apparently associated with clinical immunosuppression.
- Anti-T-cell mAbs can be associated with a clinically significant first-dose reaction.
- Immunogenicity can arise with murine, humanized and ‘fully human’ mAbs.
- Manufacturing changes can have profound effects on pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic properties *in vivo*.

More than with any other type of biologic therapy, first-into-human studies of T-cell-targeted therapies are unique experiments — crucial studies that should be undertaken with care and with intense data acquisition. Neither benefit nor risk can be predicted with certainty, and pharmacodynamic effects cannot be modelled with confidence based on *ex vivo* or preclinical models. There are still no biomarkers to confirm tolerance induction, compounding the uncertainty when this is the therapeutic goal.


B-cell-targeted therapies

In contrast to T-cell-targeted therapies, promising clinical data have emerged using mAbs and fusion proteins targeting B-cell-surface antigens and the TNF family of B-cell-survival factors. These include anti-*CD20* (rituximab (Rituxan; Genentech)), anti-*CD22* (epratuzumab (LymphoCide; Immunomedics/UCB Pharma)), anti-B-lymphocyte stimulator/B-cell-activating factor of the TNF family (anti-*BLyS*/BAFF) (belimumab (LymphoStat-B; Human Genome Sciences)), and immunoglobulin-fusion proteins of cell-surface receptors for BLyS/BAFF, including *TACI* (transmembrane activator and calcium modulator and cyclophilin ligand activator): TACI-Ig (Serono/Xymogenetics) and BAFFR-Fc/BR3-Fc (Biogen Idec/Genentech).

The use of rituximab in RA was based in part on observations in lymphoma patients with co-existing arthritis. B-cell depletion from peripheral blood can be rapid but the maximum therapeutic effect in RA and systemic lupus erythematosus (*SLE*) occurs at or after 12 weeks^52–54. Crucial pharmacodynamic actions remain uncertain: correlations between depletion of peripheral B cells, autoantibody levels and efficacy (and relapse) remain difficult to identify. Phase IIB and Phase III studies in RA, however, suggested efficacy in both sero-positive and sero-negative patients^55,56. Aside from autoantibody and rheumatoid factor production, the role of B cells in antigen presentation to T cells, cytokine and chemokine production and lymphoid architecture provide additional potential explanations for the efficacy of B-cell depletion^57,58. In randomized controlled trials in RA, B-cell reconstitution occurred at differing rates in individual patients^52,55,56,59. IgG and IgA levels did not fall in parallel with modest reductions in IgM and rheumatoid factor. IgM levels reduce further with repeated therapy cycles, which remain effective with no suggestion of increased toxicity^60. This distinction between antibody subclasses, and even between different autoantibodies (only some of which decrease in SLE patients treated with rituximab) currently remains unexplained, but is associated with retained antimicrobial antibody levels^61. In RA and SLE, repopulation of peripheral B cells following rituximab administration follows a characteristic pattern, with delayed recovery of CD27⁺ memory cells but with inter-individual variability^53,54,62,63. Flow cytometric, renal and synovial biopsy data from SLE and RA patients who have received rituximab also demonstrate significant downstream effects on other cell types^64–66. Pilot data suggest that, in RA, there is variable depletion of synovial B cells, which weakly correlates with clinical responses^66. Randomized controlled trials of rituximab are underway in SLE and in vasculitis. To date, small open-label series have generally shown clinical responses in those patients with peripheral B-cell depletion and decreases in autoantibodies^53,54,67,68. As with alemtuzumab, rituximab is associated with a first-dose reaction that is less severe in RA than in lymphoma patients (presumably reflecting a smaller B-cell ‘load’), and which can be minimized with corticosteroid pre-medication^55.

Peripheral B-cell depletion following administration of belimumab occurs later and is of less magnitude,

with associated decreases in circulating autoantibody, IgG, IgE and IgM levels<sup>69</sup>. Although efficacy in RA was limited, a subpopulation analysis in sero-positive SLE patients (antineuclear antibody (ANA) and/or anti-double-stranded DNA autoantibodies at baseline and screening, representing 72% of trial cohort), showed evidence of clinical benefit<sup>70</sup>. Phase III, randomized controlled trials are now underway in SLE. Two small, open-label pilot studies with the anti-CD22 mAb epratuzumab in SLE and primary **Sjögren’s syndrome** suggested efficacy, with associated peripheral B-cell depletion of 35–50%, little immunogenicity and no significant changes in circulating autoantibody, immunoglobulin or T-cell levels<sup>71,72</sup>. Infusion reactions with both agents were generally mild. When rituximab was administered to patients with Sjögren’s syndrome, 4 out of 15 patients developed a serum sickness-like reaction in association with the formation of human antichimeric antibodies<sup>73</sup>.

Little is known about the effects of B-cell-targeted therapies on central lymphoid tissues in humans. Elegant studies in a human CD20 transgenic mouse have shown differing patterns and mechanisms for

mAbs, and/or increased risk of infection. Lymphopaenia-induced B-cell proliferation also occurs. Clinical trials have not suggested the occurrence of secondary autoimmunity in RA but this remains a possibility as rituximab and other B-cell-targeted therapies are utilized in additional autoimmune diseases.

A recent publication, utilizing severe combined immunodeficient mice transplanted with human RA synovium, suggests that TACI–Fc might improve one histological sub-type of synovitis but actually lead to worsening in other subtypes of RA^{77}. This seems to be a consequence of the presence of ‘B-cell growth factor’ receptors on T cells, and reinforces a second recurring theme: biologic therapies might have variable treatment effects across individuals. This probably reflects the genetic and mechanistic heterogeneity of the underlying disease, and underscores the importance of a clear understanding of relevant pathophysiological mechanisms (FIG. 2). It again suggests that biologic therapies might be less specifically targeted than initially anticipated, albeit extrapolating from an artificial system.

The six main points learned from anti-B-cell therapies are:
- B-cell depletion is associated with therapeutic benefit in RA.
- There are different kinetic effects on peripheral B cells based on epitope specificity (CD20 versus CD22) and whether targeting the B cell itself or its growth factors.
- B-cell depletion varies between distinct micro-environments, in which differing effector mechanisms predominate.
- Mechanisms underlying the efficacy of B-cell-targeted therapies remain unclear. Possibilities include reduction in autoantibody production, antigen presentation and cytokine/chemokine production by B cells.
- Reconstitution of peripheral B cells varies between individuals.
- Despite peripheral B-cell depletion, biomarkers of response and relapse are elusive.

B-cell-targeted therapy has provided a new treatment paradigm for RA. Animal models again provide limited information, but might explain differing effects on B-cell populations. Mechanism of benefit remains uncertain and a ‘class effect’ cannot be assumed at this stage. As with T-cell therapies, targeting different epitopes or growth factors might result in differing benefit:risk profiles. Similarly, Phase I/II studies should incorporate intense biomarker collection, including study of target tissues.

specificity — distinct effects have been reported in other murine strains and with other anti-CD20 mAbs^{75,76}. Murine models have also indicated that repletion of B-cell populations is in part dependent on the size of these compartments.

Further studies will be necessary to confirm whether the CD20 transgenic mouse model truly reflects in vivo effects in humans. It will also be important to learn whether B-cell depletion associated with use of rituximab and other B-cell-targeted therapies will result in long-term cytopenias reminiscent of T-cell-targeted

Cytokine inhibitors: mAbs and soluble receptors

The application of TNFα blockade to treat RA is one of the major success stories of biologic therapies and translational research: in vitro modelling predicted TNFα as a therapeutic target, which was confirmed in animal models of disease. Three biologic therapies designed to inhibit TNFα are licensed. These include two mAbs: infliximab (Remicade; Centocor), a chimeric human/murine mAb and adalimumab (Humira; Abbott), a humanized mAb derived through phage-display technology. By contrast,

REVIEW S

etanercept (Enbrel; Amgen/Wyeth) is a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of the p75TNFα receptor with the hinge CH2 and CH3 domains of human IgG1. Certolizumab pegol (Cimzia; UCB Pharma), a F(ab') PEGylated mAb construct, remains in Phase III development but provides an interesting comparison. These products have resulted in significant clinical benefit in patients with inflammatory diseases, including both long-standing and early RA, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis and **psoriatic arthritis**, and inflammatory bowel diseases such as Crohn’s disease and **ulcerative colitis**. By contrast, the use of etanercept to treat sepsis provided an early lesson in the use of biologics, resulting in effects opposite to those predicted and leading to increased mortality<sup>78</sup>. Whether this reflected complex effects of TNFα in sepsis, or unanticipated consequences of the biologic agent used, remains uncertain. Of interest, however, an IgG1 anti-TNF mAb worsened endotoxin shock in mice, whereas a chimeric IgG4 version reduced it, suggesting a potential influence of the mAb Fc region (see lesson two of this review on page 84)<sup>79</sup>.

Regulation of TNFα secretion and activity is complex and occurs at multiple levels, which complicates the prediction of antagonist effects. TNFα occurs as a biologically active transmembrane molecule on a number of cell types. Cleavage by TNFα-converting enzyme (TACE) produces soluble TNFα, which is detectable in the circulation in picogram quantities. Naturally occurring p55 and p75 soluble TNFα receptors (sTNFα-RI and RII) are also shed from the cell surface by TACE and are detectable in the circulation in nanogram amounts. Although predominantly neutralizing, they have also been shown to stabilize the activity of the bound cytokine<sup>80</sup>. Anticytokine antibodies are also produced in some patients with autoimmune disease<sup>81</sup>.

The clinical use of TNFα blockers has also emphasized the heterogeneity of RA, reflecting a polygenic aetiology with several potential superimposed environmental influences. Indeed the TNFα inhibitors might provide the tools to dissect disease subsets: in some patients anti-TNFα therapy induces disease remission, whereas in others there is no response despite the presence of synovial TNFα expression in the vast majority of RA patients<sup>82</sup>. Research efforts have yet to identify reliable means of determining responsiveness, although genetic analyses of TNFα and TNFαR polymorphisms have demonstrated some associations with clinical responses to TNFα inhibitors in RA and **Crohn’s disease**<sup>83–87</sup>. Preliminary data have also demonstrated the association of polymorphisms in genes encoding FcyR with responsiveness to TNFα inhibitors in RA and psoriatic arthritis<sup>88</sup>, as well as responses in lymphoma and SLE to rituximab<sup>53,89</sup>.

pharmacokinetic parameters (C<sub>max</sub>, C<sub>min</sub> or area under the curve (AUC) levels) correlate with observed measures of safety and/or efficacy. By contrast, cytokine therapy of chronic hepatitis C infection using interferon-α (IFNα) and derivatives demonstrates a clear influence of pharmacokinetic parameters on therapeutic index (see Supplementary information S2 (box)). In general, dose and dosing regimens selected for RCTs of anti-TNFα agents were designed to maximize clinical benefit, and it is unclear whether lower doses or less frequent administration could offer similar efficacy and a broader therapeutic index. Recommended doses and dosing intervals frequently exceed estimates based on serum half-life (t<sub>½</sub>) in humans and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic observations in preclinical animal and *ex vivo* models of disease. In some cases, dosing regimes can have profound effects on tolerability (see Supplementary information S3 (box)).

TNFα inhibitors provide an excellent example of biologic agents with demonstrable clinical benefit despite limited knowledge regarding their *in vivo* mechanisms of action. Even using sophisticated *in vitro* and *ex vivo* techniques, it has been difficult to confirm whether presumed mechanisms of action occur *in vivo*. Possibilities include neutralization of soluble and/or transmembrane TNFα; crosslinking of transmembrane TNFα, leading to reverse signal transduction and caspase-induced apoptosis; lysis of membrane-TNFα-expressing cells; and apoptosis of monocyte/macrophages and/or T cells via mAb-mediated signals or cytokine deprivation, illustrated in FIG. 3<sup>90,91</sup>. Recent data also demonstrate direct and indirect effects of TNFα on regulatory T-cell function<sup>92,93</sup>. Etanercept neutralizes lymphotoxin in addition to TNFα but clinical consequences in humans have not been identified. TABLES 2,3 summarize *in vitro* and clinical differences between currently available antagonists.

As illustrated in TABLE 3, etanercept is ineffective in inflammatory bowel disease, unlike the anti-TNFα mAbs. TNFα mAbs can crosslink transmembrane TNFα and mediate apoptosis of non-TNFαR-positive cells through ‘reverse signalling’<sup>94–96</sup>. In this way, TNFα mAbs can mediate caspase-dependent apoptosis of RA synovial and peripheral blood monocytes more effectively than etanercept, although not all studies support this mode of action<sup>97</sup>. Apoptosis of TNFαR-bearing cells might also occur via neutralization of both soluble and transmembrane TNFα and consequent cytokine deprivation. Certolizumab does not mediate CDC, ADCC or apoptosis, yet is effective in RA and Crohn’s disease<sup>98,99</sup>. As both the IgG4 anti-TNFα mAb CDP 571 and certolizumab have shown efficacy in patients with Crohn’s disease and RA, these mechanistic explanations for the inefficacy of etanercept remain controversial<sup>100,101</sup>.

Both etanercept and infliximab are effective in **ankylosing spondylitis**, despite opposite observed effects on circulating T cells. The percentage of circulating CD4 and CD8 T cells expressing TNFα or IFNγ were statistically reduced 6 and 12 weeks after two consecutive infusions of infliximab<sup>102</sup>. By contrast, 12 weeks after biweekly treatment with etanercept, the percentage of CD4 and

CD8 T cells expressing TNFα and IFNγ were statistically increased compared with placebo<sup>103</sup>. A recent publication has demonstrated contrasting effects of etanercept and anti-TNF mAbs on T-cell responses to *in vitro* stimulation by *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*<sup>104</sup>. Such data reinforce the concept that TNFα inhibitors are not exclusively anti-inflammatory agents but can also exert immunomodulatory effects that can differ in important ways from agent to agent. In some patients, treatment is associated with the emergence of autoantibodies<sup>105,106</sup>.

An intriguing and paradoxical observation is that failure of one anti-TNFα therapy might not predict lack of efficacy of a second, even if both are mAbs<sup>107–110</sup>. Similarly, adverse effects can occur with one TNFα antagonist but not another. No unifying hypothesis helps us to understand or predict these observations; possibilities include distinct mechanisms of action against the same targets, subtly different epitope specificities and/or non-crossreactive neutralizing antiglobulins. Differences in pharmacokinetics, dosing routes and regimens are also potential explanations. In some patients ‘primary’ non-response — that is, complete lack of response from the start of therapy — can predict subsequent non-response to alternative anti-TNF agents<sup>111</sup>.

In some circumstances, mAbs can even potentiate the effects of the targeted cytokine. So rather than providing neutralization, some cytokine and chemokine antagonists have unexpectedly potentiated the effects of their target molecule by sequestration in a mAb–target complex. This was originally reported with an anti-IL-6 mAb<sup>112</sup> and subsequently with an anti-monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP1) mAb<sup>113</sup>. Elegant studies in mice have recently demonstrated an unanticipated mechanism underlying potentiation of IL-2 by an anti-IL-2 mAb, and the influence of epitope specificity in this regard. Different anti-IL-2 mAbs potentiated distinct aspects of cytokine function because their precise binding site on the IL-2 molecule dictated which epitopes on the sequestered IL-2 molecule remained free to bind different components of the IL-2 receptor (IL-2R). Sequestration was crucially dependent on an interaction between mAb Fc and FcγR-expressing cells, essentially converting soluble to surface-bound cytokine<sup>114</sup>. This example not only illustrates the potential and unpredictable complexity of mAb effects *in vivo*, but also the crucial role of FcγR in modulating these effects. It is important to appreciate that there were no unusual features in the structure of these incriminated mAbs, indicating that similar phenomena could occur with other therapeutic mAbs (FIG. 3d).

A major outstanding question is whether targeting IL-1β in RA can be as effective as targeting TNFα. Available evidence cannot distinguish whether the target — IL-1β — or the means of inhibition — using the short half-life IL-1 receptor antagonist IL-1ra (anakinra (Kineret; Amgen)) — explain the modest clinical and radiological benefits of anakinra compared with synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or TNFα antagonists<sup>115</sup>. Dramatic responses to anakinra administration in patients with Muckle–Wells syndrome and Stills disease, however, suggest that inhibiting IL-1β, even with a ‘less efficient’ receptor antagonist, is more than sufficient to ameliorate some inflammatory diseases<sup>116,117</sup>. This raises the possibility that IL-1β has a less ‘central’ role in RA pathogenesis than TNFα, which will require controlled trials of alternative IL-1β antagonists to provide an answer. An unanticipated finding was confirmation in an RCT that combining the TNFα inhibitor etanercept with anakinra resulted in more serious infections and less efficacy in patients with active RA than etanercept monotherapy<sup>118</sup>. By contrast, preliminary data from a 6-month RCT comparing anakinra alone or with a PEGylated p55 sTNFR construct (Pegsunercept; Amgen) showed improved efficacy with the combination, without apparent increased toxicity (J.-M. Dayer, personal communication). These data again emphasize that agents with apparently similar mechanisms of action can have different pharmacodynamic effects.

The five main points learned from using cytokine inhibitors are:

- TNFα blockade is effective in RA; one of the major success stories of biologic therapies and translational research. The efficacy of IL-1 inhibition remains less well defined.
- *In vivo* mechanisms of action in humans, underlying disease-specific differences in efficacy between mAbs and soluble receptor inhibitors, remain uncertain.
- Dose and dosing regimens selected for RCTs of anti-TNFα agents were designed to maximize clinical benefit and it is not known whether pharmacokinetic parameters (*C*<sub>max</sub>, *C*<sub>min</sub> or AUC levels) correlate with observed measures of safety and/or efficacy.
- Failure of one anti-TNFα therapy might not predict lack of efficacy of a second.

- mAbs designed to neutralize can, under some circumstances, potentiate cytokine effects.
- When designing cytokine inhibitors it is necessary to ‘think outside of the box’. The most obvious mechanism of action might not be the most relevant. Redundancy in cytokine circuitry and regulation must be considered in detail when considering potential targets, including differences between acute and chronic exposure. Animal models can be useful, but are also limited by species differences in cytokine targets. As with anti-lymphocyte mAbs, RCTs should be designed to collect appropriate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic parameters to support or refute predicted mechanisms of action.

Lesson two: Fc regions of mAbs and Ig fusion proteins confer multi-functionality on biologic agents; Fc–FcγR interactions can explain first-dose reactions, modulation of cell-surface antigen, clearance mechanisms and cell depletion.

### Fc–FcγR interactions

Substantial attention has been paid to the V regions of therapeutic mAbs in order to produce high-affinity mAbs with appropriate target specificity and epitope selectivity. To reduce immunogenicity, humanization, phage-display libraries and fully human strategies utilizing ‘human Ig transgenic mice’ have been used to eliminate non-human epitopes. Increasingly, attention has turned to the mAb Fc region, which can influence both adverse reactions and effector functions, including clearance pathways, CDC and ADCC. Intentional modulation of FcγR interactions has been pursued by varying the class and subclass of the Fc, designing mAbs with mutated Fc regions, altering the glycosylation state of the Fc, as well as creating bi-specific agents incorporating antireceptor antigen binding moieties¹¹⁹,¹²⁰.

The Fc region of mAb and Ig fusion proteins enhances serum half-life through binding to FcRn (also known as the Brambell receptor or the neonatal FcγR), which in turn facilitates mAb recycling and decreases catabolism¹²¹. The Fc region additionally mediates binding to the classical FcγR and engages receptor-dependent cell programs characteristic of the specific receptor(s) bound. Such binding also facilitates target antigen clustering that in turn can trigger intrinsic cell programs, such as apoptosis, or receptor-mediated programs in the FcγR-bearing cell. Alongside complement activation, each intrinsic cell programme can contribute to target cell lysis and death. Each can also be modified by mAb design and/or production processes, resulting in ‘designer’ mAbs ideally suited to a particular therapeutic situation¹²²⁻¹²⁴. Such specific protein engineering requires understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) of disease, including the cell types involved, their portfolio of FcγR expression (which can be influenced by cytokine environment), and the effects of human FcγR polymorphisms⁴⁰,⁴¹. Some circumstances — for example, tumour therapy — can dictate optimal cell lysis, whereas mAbs without Fc effector function will suit other scenarios. For example, an aglycosylated anti-CD3 mAb that cannot activate complement or bind FcγRs, is under investigation as a non-lytic, minimally toxic therapy for autoimmune disease¹²⁵,¹²⁶. In this case, as with another Fc-mutated anti-CD3 mAb, infusion-related adverse effects were much reduced compared with the well known mAb OKT3¹²⁷,¹²⁸.

Despite a wealth of in vitro data, rules governing mAb Fc effector function in vivo are complex and not well defined. For example, activation of specific complement factors by the Fc region of a mAb does not necessarily result in activation of downstream components¹²⁹. Furthermore, mechanisms underlying in vivo cytotoxicity vary between mAbs and, as exemplified by anti-CD20, for the same mAb in distinct micro-environments⁷⁴. Murine models have been of limited utility in predicting in vivo effects of specific mAbs in individual patients¹³⁰⁻¹³². As demonstrated by anti-CD4 and anti-CD52 (alemtuzumab) mAbs, studies in humans remain the only certain way to identify treatment-associated consequences. Ultimately, the target antigen is crucially important in determining the consequences of mAb binding. Antigen density is relevant but specific features of the target antigen and bound epitope seem to determine cytotoxicity. This might reflect the ease with which mAb Fc domains are presented in configuration for complement and/or FcγR binding and activation¹³³. The alemtuzumab antigen (CD52) provides an example of an exceptionally potent target for mAb-mediated cytotoxicity — heavily glycosylated but very small. The epitope or mAb-binding site lies close to the glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol membrane anchor, which might provide efficient access to the target cell membrane for reactive complement intermediates and/or factors released from effector cells¹⁷,¹³⁴.

All therapeutics with IgG1 constructs share an Fc constant region that is common to anti-CD4, anti-TNFα mAbs, alemtuzumab, rituximab and etanercept, and which is theoretically capable of mediating ADCC and CDC¹³⁵,¹³⁶. As emphasized above, distinct features of the target antigen govern ultimate cytotoxicity but even administration of the same mAb to different individuals can result in variable cell depletion. This reflects individual FcγR genotypes and consequent differences in affinity for the IgG1 constant region. For example, polymorphisms of FcγRIIIA (CD16) influence clinical responses following administration of rituximab in lymphoma and SLE and of infliximab

in Crohn’s disease<sup>53,89,137</sup>. In the case of rituximab, this clinical effect reflects the impact of receptor genotype on both the kinetics and degree of B-cell depletion, and illustrates how known genetic polymorphisms of FcγR with defined biological functions can serve as probes to help elucidate the mechanisms of action of therapeutic mAbs. The same CD16 polymorphism has also been associated with responsiveness of RA patients to TNFα blockade, where the high-affinity variant segregates with reduced responsiveness<sup>88</sup>. Whether this represents a direct interaction of the anti-TNFα agent with the receptor or association of the high-affinity CD16 allele with more severe RA has not been established<sup>138,139</sup>. The latter possibility is supported by evidence that FcγRIIIA genotype influences synovial expression of TNFα in a manner that is distinct from its effects on immune complex clearance in SLE<sup>41,140</sup>.

The important influences of FcγR genotype on outcomes following biologic therapy suggest that, ultimately, treatment and/or dosing schedule could be adjusted based on genotype. Additionally, FcγR genotypes might be predictive of disease-specific unwanted effects of mAb therapy. The first-dose ‘cytokine-release syndrome’ was initially described following administration of OKT3, a mitogenic mAb that crosslinks cell-surface CD3 molecules and activates T lymphocytes<sup>141,142</sup>. A similar syndrome associated with infusions of alemtuzumab was described earlier and has been attributed to sequential release of TNFα, interferon-γ and IL-6<sup>23</sup>. Hypotension, fever, gastrointestinal upset and/or rigors occur following crosslinking of cell-surface mAb by FcγR, with subsequent activation of either T cells (with OKT3) or FcγR-bearing cells (with alemtuzumab)<sup>25</sup>. The consequences of administration of TGN1412 to healthy volunteers serve to remind us that even mAbs with the human IgG4 isotype can interact with human FcγR, despite limited activity in *in vitro* assays<sup>49,135</sup>.

The four main points learned from studying Fc–FcγR interactions are:

- Inter-individual differences in beneficial and adverse effects of mAb therapy can be expected, based on FcγR polymorphisms.
- Substituted and aglycosylated Fc constructs, with reduced affinity for FcγR, have successfully reduced first-dose reactions and increased tolerability.
- Specific FcγR polymorphisms are associated with disease and also infectious susceptibility, which might impact benefit:risk profiles of therapies<sup>143</sup>.
- The precise consequences of mAb binding are influenced by Fc design, but target antigen specificity has a major influence.

When developing a novel mAb, the likely disease indications should inform Fc design. Is a lytic or a blocking mAb desirable? Are there specific FcγR polymorphisms associated with the underlying disease that might impact the benefit:risk profile? Is a first-dose reaction anticipated, which might be influenced by FcγR genotype? Consideration should be given to stratifying Phase I/II clinical trials by FcγR genotype or, at minimum, collecting information on subject FcγR genotype.

Lesson three: immunogenicity is a feature of all biologic agents; antiglobulins can have important clinical consequences.

### Immunogenicity

All biologics can be immunogenic, regardless of efforts to minimize immunogenicity<sup>144–146</sup>. Recombinant insulin and erythropoietin are both immunogenic, and administration of adalimumab, a ‘fully human’ mAb, is associated with immunogenicity in approximately 12% of patients (2% if co-administered with methotrexate)<sup>147</sup>. Factors that can influence the immunogenicity of biologic agents are listed in BOX 3. Many of these are fixed for a particular patient in a specific clinical situation. Therefore no biologic agent will prove invisible to all human recipients, although increasingly sophisticated methods designed to induce tolerance continue to be developed<sup>148</sup>. As with biologic effects, immunogenicity is also unpredictably influenced by aspects of the manufacturing process (see Supplementary information S4 (box)).

The consequences of immunogenicity vary. Anti-V region responses can be directed towards the binding site of the mAb (anti-idiotypes), in which case they are usually neutralizing<sup>149</sup>. This can be confirmed by flow cytometry or specific bioassays<sup>145,150</sup>. Immune responses to the Fc region (anti-isotype) can enhance mAb clearance, requiring more frequent or higher doses. Anti-isotype (or anti-allotype) responses can also underpin a ‘serum sickness’ syndrome observed in some patients. This was reported in patients receiving intermittent courses of infliximab for Crohn’s disease, and can also occur in patients who have previously received a mAb of different specificity but with a shared FcIgG1 portion, or multiple courses of intravenous Ig<sup>151</sup>. Anaphylactic responses are fortunately rare<sup>152</sup>. As mentioned above, administration of humanized, soluble receptor constructs and even ‘fully human’ mAbs (produced by homologous recombination in transgenic mice) can result in measurable immune responses<sup>153</sup>. These are difficult to predict in preclinical animal models and are typically hard to correlate with presence or absence of adverse effects. Under some circumstances, antiglobulin responses are potentially beneficial<sup>154</sup>.

Measurements of immunogenicity, as well as bioassays for neutralizing antiglobulin, require a great deal of sophistication. Although ‘sandwich’ or ‘double capture’ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) assays are designed to detect specific immune responses to the administered mAb or soluble receptor, they preferentially detect high-affinity responses<sup>155</sup>. Importantly, rheumatoid factors can produce high pretreatment ‘background’ signals in some assays, behaving as anti-Igs; however, they have not been reported to provoke an IgG-specific immune response nor are they predictive of the development of neutralizing antibodies. As an illustrative example of the subtleties of anti-Ig responses, repeated administration of lenacept (Tenercept; Roche), a p55 sTNFαR–IgG1 fusion protein, resulted in sensitization: anti-Igs bound to the Fc but not the TNFα-binding site itself and were not neutralizing, and also did not affect observed efficacy

Box 3 | Factors that influence immunogenicity

### Product dependent
- Presence of non-human sequences, including neo-antigens derived from joining sequences on fusion proteins. The fact that ‘humanized’ monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) retain immunogenicity reflects the uniqueness of idiotypes and demonstrates that this region of the recombinant molecule remains foreign to the recipient’s immune system.
- Glycosylation patterns, which are influenced by the production process (see Supplementary information S1 (box)).
- Immunoglobulin (Ig) allotype. Variability in variable (V) and constant (C) region allotypes ultimately indicates that similarity to germ-line immunoglobulin sequences might be no better than for certain rodent mAbs<sup>194</sup>. Notably, human IgG4 is non-allotypic, and therefore potentially advantageous in terms of immunogenicity<sup>195</sup>.
- Conjugation with polyethylene glycol (PEG). Conjugation with PEG can either decrease or increase immunogenicity, determined in part by in vivo metabolism of the PEG portion of the molecule<sup>196</sup>.
- Target antigen
  - **Cell-surface antigen binding.** Idiotypic regions of mAbs that bind to cell-surface antigens are particularly immunogenic, perhaps because of enhanced presentation to antigen-presenting cells<sup>197</sup>. This includes mAbs that rapidly result in cytotoxicity, as demonstrated by alemtuzumab, which provokes an antiglobulin response despite potently depleting recipient B and T lymphocytes<sup>198</sup>.
  - **Associated cytokine-release syndrome.** Cytokine-release syndromes can enhance immunogenicity via an adjuvant effect<sup>141,199,200</sup>.
- Formulation and packaging. Impurities leached from packaging materials (for example, rubber bungs) can influence immunogenicity.
- Presence of impurities or aggregates, which can reflect the production process<sup>201</sup>.

### Patient dependent
- Underlying immunocompetence.
- Genetic differences.
- Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype. A patient’s MHC haplotype determines whether or not potentially immunogenic epitopes can be efficiently presented to the immune system, a sine qua non for immunogenicity<sup>202</sup>.
- Immunoglobulin allotype.
- **FcγR polymorphisms.** FcγR polymorphisms, which can influence cytotoxicity and cytokine-release syndromes.
- Epigenetic phenomena. Exposure to maternal immunoglobulins during gestation and perinatally could, in theory, induce tolerance to non-inherited maternal allotypes.
- Disease under treatment. Antiglobulins are uncommon in patients receiving biologic therapy for lymphoma. Rheumatoid arthritis is also associated with intrinsic immunosuppression
- Concomitant administration of immunosuppressive agents.
  - Azathioprine or methotrexate decreased measured immune responses to a murine anti-CD5 immunoconjugate and to infliximab in patients with rheumatoid arthritis<sup>162,203</sup>.
  - Synergy between methotrexate and other biologics might reflect effects on immunogenicity as well as other mechanisms.

### Treatment schedule
- Subcutaneous versus intravenous administration. Intravenous administration seems to be the least, and subcutaneous the most, immunogenic route for biologic therapies. Factors accounting for this include differences in antigen processing and presentation in peripheral lymph nodes versus spleen.
- Intermittent treatment versus maintenance regimen. When tolerance is induced to a foreign protein, it is maintained as long as the protein remains accessible to the tolerant immune system<sup>197</sup>. This might in part explain why immunogenicity and infusion reactions are reported more commonly when mAbs are administered on an intermittent basis.
- High versus low doses. Immunogenicity is less common with higher biologic doses, possibly a manifestation of ‘high zone’ tolerance.

Box 4 | Immunogenicity to infliximab: a case study

Early studies in rheumatoid arthritis suggested that administration of low-dose (1 mg per kg) infliximab (Remicade; Centocor) without co-administration of methotrexate (MTX) was associated with an antiglobulin (anti-lg) response in 53% of patients, whereas addition of MTX reduced it to 15%<sup>162</sup>. Results following treatment with 3 mg per kg (21% versus 7%) and 10 mg per kg (7% versus 0%) infliximab not only confirmed that MTX reduced sensitization but also suggested that higher doses of monoclonal antibody (mAb) might be less immunogenic, possibly a manifestation of ‘high zone’ tolerance. An alternative explanation suggests potential masking of anti-lgs by persisting circulating mAb with higher dosing regimes. Although the clinical consequences of an anti-lg response remain to be fully elucidated, a recent study in Crohn’s disease clearly illustrates a relationship with infusion reactions, reduced circulating infliximab levels and curtailed efficacy<sup>204</sup>. In this study, anti-lgs were present overall in 61% of infliximab recipients (5 mg per kg as a single infusion or as a course of 3 infusions over 6 weeks), and were seen in 75% of patients not receiving concomitant immunosuppressives compared with 43% with background therapy. In the 27% of patients with infusion reactions, anti-lgs at the time of dosing were, on average, six times higher than in patients without reactions. The half-life of infliximab was reduced by 50% in patients with clinically relevant anti-lg levels. Regular maintenance administration might, in part, account for the lower incidence (6–27%) of anti-lgs reported in other randomized controlled trials in Crohn’s disease, although this is unlikely to be the sole explanation<sup>205–208</sup>. Recent data suggest an incidence of anti-lgs to infliximab in rheumatoid arthritis patients of approximately 43%, which again are associated with infusion reactions and reduced efficacy<sup>209</sup>.

- The sequelae of sensitization vary from anaphylaxis (rare) and infusion reactions to reduced circulating half-life. In many cases, there is no obvious impact of immunogenicity on safety or efficacy.
- Standardized assays for anti-Igs are required, as are international standards for inter-laboratory comparisons.

In general, a humanized mAb is likely to be less immunogenic than a conventional murine mAb. If Fc engineering is undertaken for other reasons, allotypic influences on immunogenicity should be considered. The potential consequences of production processes and formulation should not be overlooked. If different treatment regimens are feasible, immunogenicity considerations can influence the ultimate choice. Background therapy with methotrexate has a synergistic effect with TNFα inhibitors and rituximab<sup>162–164</sup>. Although this might partly reflect its impact on immunogenicity, methotrexate prolongs the half-life of adalimumab, certolizumab and infliximab, but not rituximab<sup>147,165,166</sup>. There are no published data with regard to etanercept.

Lesson four: as with efficacy, observed adverse effects of biologic therapies might not be entirely predictable.

### Adverse effects

The use of TNFα inhibitors might best illustrate the difficulty of predicting *in vivo* adverse responses based on *in vitro* or *ex vivo* assays. The increased incidence of tuberculosis and other intracellular infections in recipients of TNFα blockade reflects the crucial importance of this cytokine for granuloma formation and maintenance<sup>167–169</sup>. Transgenic murine models have shown that transmembrane TNFα is crucial for the control of mycobacterium infections and that, in the absence of soluble TNFα, it is sufficient to mount host defence against acute infection<sup>170,171</sup>. Consistent with these findings, other models suggest that elevated levels of soluble TNFα mediate pro-inflammatory effects, whereas the transmembrane form is essential for juxtacrine apoptotic effects, granuloma formation and maintenance of immune surveillance<sup>172</sup>. Both are required to maintain long-term granuloma integrity, however<sup>173</sup>. As mAb and soluble receptor inhibitors both bind soluble and transmembrane TNFα, it remains unclear whether the incidence of tuberculosis varies across products because of differences inherent in the agents and/or the underlying risk factors in the populations exposed<sup>174,175</sup>. Distinct effects of the three licensed products on T-cell responsiveness and IFNγ production in response to exposure to *M. tuberculosis in vitro* might, however, be relevant<sup>104</sup>. It is important to recognize that TNFα blockade might actually improve immune competence in RA, especially in patients with long-standing active disease, via improved efficiency of T-cell signalling<sup>176,177</sup>.

The paradoxical effect of TNFα blockade on the CNS remains unexplained. TNFα levels correlate with symptomatology in multiple sclerosis, yet blocking this cytokine not only worsens disease but seems to invoke *de novo* demyelination<sup>178,179</sup>. In the cuprizone-induced demyelination model, remyelination did not occur in TNFα-knockout mice<sup>180</sup>. Gene-array analysis indicated oligodendrocyte regeneration to be dependent on a TNFα-induced inflammatory response, suggesting that demyelination syndromes associated with TNFα blockade might actually reflect disordered myelin repair. The effect of TNFα blockade on cardiovascular function is similarly enigmatic — the failing heart contains high levels of TNFα, but TNFα blockade can exacerbate pre-existing congestive heart failure, or precipitate *de novo* disease<sup>181–183</sup>. Of course, the association of RA with underlying arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease is now well recognized, and patients most at risk for the development of cardiac complications are those with long-standing, active disease, who are also most likely to receive biologic therapies. In fact, treatment with infliximab improved vascular endothelial function in 11 patients with long-standing RA<sup>184</sup>, and Wolfe *et al.* reported a lower incidence of new-onset congestive heart failure in patients receiving TNFα inhibitors in the National Databank of Rheumatic Diseases<sup>185</sup>. Similarly, the incidence of lymphoma is well recognized to be higher in patients with long-standing, active RA, which complicates assessments of lymphoma risk in relation to biologic therapies<sup>186,187</sup>.

Not all mechanistically associated adverse effects can be predicted from conventional animal models because of differences in immune physiology or target molecule expression. CD40 ligand (CD40L) forms, with CD40, one half of an important co-stimulatory molecule pair. Blockade of this interaction with anti-CD40L mAb provided benefit in animal models of SLE, with preliminary evidence for efficacy in Phase I human studies<sup>188,189</sup>. Trials were terminated, however, because of unpredicted thromboembolic complications — potentially reflecting the presence of CD40L on activated human platelets. Biologic therapies are in their infancy and, as with all new drug classes, it is essential to remain alert to the possibility of both expected and unpredicted adverse effects.

REVIEWS

Box 5 | Recommendations for development of future biologic therapies
- Phase I and II studies should capture maximal pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic information, in addition to efficacy biomarkers. First-into-disease studies should focus on events at the site of disease (for example, via arthroscopic synovial biopsy), and perhaps at other relevant sites such as lymph nodes. Analyses should attempt to correlate pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data as far as possible.
- Polymorphisms in fragment crystallizable-γ receptors (FcγR) might underlie inter-individual differences in efficacy or adverse effects, and consideration should be given to stratifying Phase I and II studies according to FcγR genotype.
- Glycosylation of the Fc has a significant impact on biological activities, and changes in production processes should be assessed from this perspective.
- Immunogenicity is likely to be seen with all biologic agents, and is influenced by trial design, the disease under treatment and concurrent therapy. Consequences vary but assays and international standards are needed to enable comparison between trials, laboratories and agents themselves.
- All patients receiving biologic agents should be entered into registries. Registries should incorporate ‘control’ groups of disease patients receiving non-biologic therapies for comparison.
- Combination therapy with biologic agents should be evaluated with caution in randomized controlled trials prior to empiric use.

Conclusions

There is no doubt that biologic therapies provide a potent and unique addition to our therapeutic armamentarium for rheumatic diseases. We have focused on unpredicted and unanticipated aspects of therapy but it is important to distinguish those that are inherent to the agents themselves from those that reflect underlying immune dysregulation and gaps in our own knowledge. RA is a tremendously heterogeneous disease and no single intervention should be expected to provide a panacea for all patients. Similarly, the anticipated beauty and simplicity of biologic therapies reflects a naive approach to the prediction of clinical outcomes. The immune system is intricate and functions in a micro-environment of cell–cell interactions, with multiple negative and positive regulatory influences, some of which seem to be redundant, others difficult to predict, and none entirely understood. It is important not to underestimate these subtleties when considering the development of novel therapies. Certain *in vivo* consequences of biologic therapy could have been anticipated only via access to a model immune system comprising all of the appropriate human cell types within their various complex micro-environments — which are not currently available, nor will they be in the foreseeable future. *Ex vivo* and whole-blood assays provide an overly simplistic and poor substitute.

A number of important features of biologic agents make them a novel therapeutic class over and above their production processes. Specificity contributes to their uniqueness but also complicates the preclinical assessment of efficacy and safety. Animal testing is frequently poorly informative and can be misleading. Even in situations in which antigen is bound identically, as in a transgenic animal model, FcγR interactions probably differ from those in humans. Antigen expression levels are also important, and transgenic studies are therefore unlikely to provide appropriate answers. Polymorphism across FcγRs further complicates the prediction of *in vivo* effects in humans, as do disease- and inflammation-associated changes in FcγR (or target antigen) expression. Immunogenicity adds a further dimension of complexity once chronic dosing is considered. In consideration of these factors, Phase I studies of biologic agents in humans must be recognized for what they are — unique experiments for which *in vitro* or preclinical animal data can provide only limited guidance.

Recent experience with TGN1412 has only served to highlight this situation^{5,49}. Whether or not the catastrophic consequences of administering TGN1412 to healthy volunteers could have been predicted remains subject to conjecture. Preclinical studies provided no safety signals, however, and it would not be surprising if an *ex vivo* correlate that warned of the magnitude of the ensuing biological reaction was difficult or impossible to identify. Hopefully, this tragic incident will not prevent future testing of potentially beneficial mAbs, although it is clear that Phase I protocols will now be subject to closer scrutiny and, arguably, could be stratified according to FcγR genotype^{51}. But it must be recognized that potent and clinically unique drugs, biologic or otherwise,

From the perspective of immunosuppression, biologic agents should be safer than conventional pharmaceuticals targeting the immune system. This reflects their specificity, as well as redundancy within the immune system. The association of TNFα blockade with reactivation of tuberculosis provides an example in which there is limited redundancy. Combining biologic therapies might heighten the risk of infectious and malignant complications, by targeting parallel ‘redundant’ pathways, illustrated by one combination of TNFα and IL-1β blockade and TNFα inhibition with abatacept. In the latter study, there was a high reported incidence of serious infections and malignancies^{118,190}. This was also observed with combination etanercept and cyclophosphamide therapy in **Wegener’s granulomatosis**^{191}. True synergy between biologic agents could permit their efficacious combination in sub-therapeutic doses, but it is clear that further studies to demonstrate this must be designed with great care.

The three main points learned from studying adverse effects are:
- As with efficacy, adverse effects of biologic therapy might not be predictable from existing knowledge of immune physiology, *in vitro* or *ex vivo* testing.
- Combination use of biologic agents should be approached with caution.
- Patients currently receiving biologic therapies are frequently those with most severe disease, who are most likely to develop adverse effects.

Serious adverse effects are, fortunately, uncommon. Consequently, however, they are rarely detected in pre-licensing trials. Post-marketing surveillance and the establishment of national registries for patients receiving biologic agents are the appropriate way to identify and study ‘signals’ of rare adverse events. Registries, in particular, provide a means to capture adverse effects of therapy while accounting for the peculiarities of the disease under treatment^{175,187,192}.

might have narrow therapeutic indices. It is worth noting that preclinical and *in vitro* studies of the mAb in question have contributed substantially to our knowledge of the mechanisms underlying T-cell activation<sup>193</sup>.

With three anti-TNFα drugs as well as anakinra, rituximab and abatacept now licensed for the treatment of RA, biologic therapy for autoimmune diseases has

come of age. Even 15 years ago it would have been difficult to predict the impact these therapies have had on such a common disease as RA. It is now essential that we build on the lessons learned during the development of these agents in our quest for ever better therapeutics.
