## ABSTRACT

In B lymphocytes, a signaling complex that contributes to cell fate decisions is the B cell antigen receptor (BCR). Data from knockout experiments in cell lines and mice have revealed distinct functions for the intracellular protein tyrosine kinases (Lyn, Syk, Btk) in BCR signaling and B cell development. Combinations of intracellular signaling pathways downstream of these PTKs determine the quality and quantity of BCR signaling. For example, concerted actions of the PLC-γ2 and PI3-K pathways are required for proper calcium responses. Similarly, the regulation of ERK and JNK responses involves both PLC-γ2 and GTPases pathways. Since the immune response in vivo is regulated by alteration of these signaling outcomes, achieving a precise understanding of intracellular molecular events leading to B lymphocyte proliferation, deletion, anergy, receptor editing, and survival still remains a challenge for the future.

## INTRODUCTION

The B cell antigen receptor (BCR) mediates the response of B lymphocytes to foreign antigen. The existence of the BCR was a central prediction of the clonal selection hypothesis of Burnet (1) and Talmage (2) that the diversity in the immune response is due to the selection and expansion of genetically committed antibody-producing cells (B lymphocytes). Although originally invoked to account for the proposed antigen-specific activation of B cell clones, it has become clear that the BCR plays a central role in determining the fate of B cells even before it encounters antigen (3). For instance, progression through

the pre-B cell stage of differentiation (during which antigen receptors are being assembled) depends on the presence of the pre-BCR, which is composed of functional heavy chains and surrogate light chains with their signaling subunits, Igα and Igβ.

The outcomes of these developmental responses as well as antigen-specific responses are mediated by signal transduction through the BCR. Transmembrane signaling is further regulated or fine-tuned by an array of cytoplasmic signal transduction molecules that amplify or dampen signals during B cell development. Key cytoplasmic regulators include kinases, phosphatases, lipid metabolizing enzymes, and adaptor molecules that greatly influence the strength and quality of transmembrane signaling events. Cell surface regulators such as CD19, CD22, PIR-B, and FcγRIIB also inform B cells of their extracellular microenvironment, thereby defining signaling thresholds within B cells. The purpose of this review is to summarize the major advances made in defining the functions of cytoplasmic and cell surface regulatory proteins and to discuss the mechanisms by which the BCR induces such heterogeneous cellular responses as cell survival, death, and receptor editing.

# FUNCTION OF THE BCR COMPONENT

The BCR is characterized by a complex hetero-oligomeric structure in which ligand binding and signal transduction are compartmentalized into distinct receptor subunits. The ligand-binding portion of this receptor is membrane immunoglobulin (mIg), which is a tetrameric complex of Ig heavy (H) and light (L) chains; the signal transduction component comprises a disulfide-bonded heterodimer of the Igα (CD79α) and Igβ (CD79β) molecules. In developing B cells, rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain (H) locus variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) segment occurs before light chain rearrangement. In this transitional stage, membrane-bound Igμ (mIgμ) associates with surrogate light chains (λ5 and VpreB) and with the Igα-Igβ to form a preBCR complex, the presence of which allows cell lineage progression to the pre-B cell stage as well as allelic exclusion (Figure 1). Indeed, targeted disruption of the mIgμ transmembrane domain (mIgμT⁻/⁻) results in loss of H chain allelic exclusion as well as a specific developmental block at the pro-B cell stage (4, 5), whereas λ5 mutant (λ5⁻/⁻) mice showed impaired, but not completely blocked, B cell development (6, 7) (Figure 1).

Perhaps the most critical insights of the past decade in the study of BCR signal transduction have been the discovery of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) within the Igα and Igβ subunits of the BCR (8), and recognition of the activation of protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). The ITAMs in

GENETICS OF B CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING 557

Figure 1 Function of BCR components and signaling molecules in B cell development.

the cytoplasmic regions of Igα and Igβ are characterized by six conserved amino acids (D/Ex<sub>7</sub>D/Ex<sub>2</sub>Yx<sub>2</sub>L/Ix<sub>7</sub>Yx<sub>2</sub>L/I). The function of the ITAMs was revealed in experiments in which chimeric receptors containing ITAMs were constructed and expressed in cultured lymphocytes. Clustering of these chimeric receptors using anti-receptor antibodies induced signaling events including PTK activation and calcium mobilization. This signaling function was abolished by mutations that changed either of the two conserved tyrosine residues of the ITAM to phenylalanine, indicating the importance of phosphorylation on these tyrosines (9, 10).

Introducing similar chimeric receptors in recombination activating (RAG)<sup>−/−</sup> (11) or mIgμT<sup>−/−</sup> (12) mice provided the compelling evidence that signaling through a preBCR complex mediates the activation of B cell development. A mIgμ mutant (mIgμm) that is unable to associate with endogenous Igα/Igβ fails to signal for allelic exclusion and developmental progression to the pre-B cell stage. Chimeric molecules composed of mIgμm and the cytoplasmic domain of Igβ or Igα are sufficient to overcome this developmental block; more importantly, functional reconstitution is dependent on tyrosine residues within the ITAM (11).

The effects of Igα and Igβ on B cell development were more directly examined by in vivo targeting experiments. Although Igβ<sup>−/−</sup> mice still have endogenous Igα, because of the inability of Igα to form a homodimeric signaling complex, this Igβ defect eventually results in the functional knockout of both Igβ and Igα. Mice deficient in Igβ exhibit a complete impairment in B cell development. Moreover, this block occurs before variable (V<sub>H</sub>) to diversity joining (DJ<sub>H</sub>) recombination (13). There are at least two potential explanations for the Igβ<sup>−/−</sup> phenotype. The first is that Igα and Igβ may also perform signaling functions as part of a surrogate BCR (as proposed for Igα/Igβ-calnexin) and that signaling through this surrogate BCR would be required to make cells competent to undergo V-DJ rearrangement. Supporting this concept, cross-linking Igβ in vivo in Rag-2-deficient mice induced progression from the pro-B to pre-B cell stages (14). The second explanation is that, although V-DJ rearrangement occurs in Igβ<sup>−/−</sup> mice, albeit at low levels, selection and amplification of productive rearrangements require Igα/Igβ. In addition to a requirement for Igβ in the efficient completion of V-DJ recombination, Igβ is also essential for negative selection of B cells that carry antibody genes encoding truncated Ig heavy chains (Dμ). Dμ is the truncated form of mIgμ, which is encoded by DJ<sub>H</sub> rearrangements in reading frame 2 (RF2). In wild-type mice, this Dμ complex produces allelic exclusion, yet such cells cannot develop to any further differentiated stage because they are selected against. The readout of this negative selection is an under-representation of Igs with variable regions encoded in RF2 (Figure 1). Based on the observation of no bias against RF2 in either DJ or VDJ

sequences from sorted Ig$\beta^{-/-}$ pro-B cells (15), Nussenzweig and co-workers proposed that signals through Ig$\beta$ are required for deleting the D$\mu$ complex.

The signaling capacity of Ig$\alpha$ was examined by deleting its cytoplasmic domain. In the cytoplasmic Ig$\alpha^{-/-}$ mice, the BCR was properly assembled and was composed of mIg$\mu$ associated with complete Ig$\beta$ and truncated Ig$\alpha$. These mice showed apparently normal pre-B cell development, whereas the number of peripheral B cells was decreased tenfold (16). This may be due to decreased persistent signals delivered by BCR. The requirement of maintained BCR expression in order for a mature B cell to persist has been demonstrated by using the technique of inducible gene targeting to delete the rearranged $V_{H}$ gene in mature B cells (17). This persistent signal differs from the activation signal in that it does not lead to entry into the cell cycle or to an upregulation of the costimulatory molecules-changes that occur when the BCR is cross-linked with high-affinity antigen or anti-immunoglobulin. Hence, two distinct signals are thought to be delivered by the BCR: a persistence signal and an activation signal. Presumably this distinction lies in the nature and extent of BCR cross-linking and/or in the developmental stages of B cells. Thus, the simplest explanation for the decreased number of peripheral B cells in cytoplasmic Ig$\alpha^{-/-}$ mice is that the persistence signal through BCR requires both Ig$\alpha$ and Ig$\beta$ while Ig$\beta$ alone is sufficient for pre-B cell development. Whether this differential requirement for B cell development reflects quantitative or qualitative differences of signaling activity between Ig$\alpha$/Ig$\beta$ and Ig$\beta$ alone remains to be determined. Collectively, these series of elegant experiments show that the strength and quality of signals transmitted by the surrogate BCR, pre-BCR, and BCR affect the fate of B cells in many different ways, depending on the maturation stages of B cells.

## FUNCTION OF PTKs AND PTPases

As the BCR has no intrinsic PTK activity, this receptor utilizes several distinct families of cytoplasmic PTKs and PTPases. Indeed, three distinct types of PTKs have been found to be activated upon BCR engagement: the Src-PTKs (Lyn, Blk, and Fyn), Syk, and Btk. Recent gene-targeting experiments have dissected the functions of these PTKs and PTPases in BCR signaling as well as in B cell development.

### Lyn

Lyn$^{-/-}$ mice exhibit apparently normal B cell development in the bone marrow, whereas the number of peripheral B cells is decreased with an increased proportion of immature B cells (18, 19). Enhanced ERK activation and a subsequent hyperproliferative response upon BCR engagement was observed in these mice (20). Furthermore, Lyn$^{-/-}$ mice carrying transgenic BCRs (anti-HEL)

exhibited exaggerated negative selection responses to self-antigen, as expected  
from the enhanced signaling properties of Lyn$^{-/-}$ mice (21). Thus, the pro-  
duction of auto-antibodies in Lyn$^{-/-}$ mice is somewhat surprising. Since the  
antigen-independent formation of plasma cells is greatly exaggerated in the  
absence of Lyn, this may reflect an elevation of spontaneous plasma cell  
differentiation.  

An explanation for enhanced activation of B cells in vivo in the absence of  
Lyn has been envisaged by an analysis of CD22 knockout mice. CD22 is known  
to inhibit BCR-induced responses; indeed, CD22 knockout mice exhibit hyper-  
responsiveness to BCR stimulation (22–25). The inhibitory signal is mediated  
through the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based inhibitory  
motif (ITIM) located in the cytoplasmic domains of CD22 (26). Assuming that  
Lyn is the PTK responsible for the phosphorylation of CD22 ITIMs, loss of Lyn  
decreases both its phosphorylation and subsequent SHP-1 recruitment, resulting  
in a dampening of the inhibitory signals of CD22 and a subsequent hyper-  
responsiveness. In fact, tyrosine phosphorylation of CD22 and its subsequent  
association with SHP-1 were inhibited in Lyn$^{-/-}$ mice (27, 28). Moreover, using  
BCR transgenic system (anti-HEL), genetic interactions among Lyn, CD22, and  
SHP-1 have been examined by intercrossing heterozygotes for the mutation of  
these genes, demonstrating that negative selection in the presence of sHEL is  
exaggerated in a cumulative manner by 50% loss of these three gene products  
(21). Therefore, these data indicate that Lyn, CD22, and SHP-1 operate in  
a single pathway and that each of three elements is a limiting component.  
Collectively, these experiments indicate that BCR-activated Lyn subserves both  
a negative regulatory role (by phosphorylating inhibitory receptors such as  
CD22, which dampens BCR signaling) and positive regulatory roles.  

**Syk**

In contrast to Lyn$^{-/-}$ mice, in Syk$^{-/-}$ mice bone marrow B cells accumulate  
at the late pro-B stage, suggesting a block in B cell development at the pro-B  
to pre-B cell transition (29, 30). Although Rag2$^{-/-}$ mice show a similar B cell  
developmental arrest, Syk$^{-/-}$ mice exhibit the presence of rearrangements in  
the Ig H chain. These data indicate that Syk is required for signaling through the  
pre-BCR and thus for the clonal expansion of pre-B cells that have productively  
rearranged the Ig H chain genes. Moreover, like the Ig$\beta^{-/-}$ mice discussed  
above, Syk$^{-/-}$ mice show no bias against RF2 in DJ rearrangements (30). Thus,  
Syk participates in negative selection of the D$\mu$ complex as well as positive  
selection for clonal expansion of pre-B cells expressing successfully rearranged  
Ig H chains (Figure 1). Hence, Syk appears to be more critically involved in  
B cell development, independent of Lyn. However, the argument has not been  
formally excluded that a complete knockout of Src-family PTKs (for example,

the triple knockout of Lyn, Fyn, and Blk) leads to a phenotype similar to that  
of the Syk knockout.

In addition to the role of Syk in antigen-independent processes, Syk is es-  
sential for progression of immature B cells into the recirculating pool of B cells  
(31) (Figure 1). This is not due to the short life span of immature B cells by loss  
of Syk. Instead, Tybulewicz et al proposed the hypothesis that Syk might be  
involved in the expression of the chemokine receptor BLR1, based on the fact  
that BLR1${}^{-/-}$ B cells, like Syk${}^{-/-}$ B cells (32), are also unable to enter splenic  
follicles.

**Btk**

Btk was isolated as the gene responsible for X-linked agammaglobulinemia  
(XLA) (33, 34). Peripheral B cells from XLA patients are rare and exhibit an  
immature phenotype, but the number of pre-B cells in the bone marrow is not  
significantly reduced, suggesting impaired cellular proliferation or increased  
cell death at the pre-B to B cell transition. In contrast, a point mutation in the  
Btk pleckstrin homology (PH) domain in mice causes a mild X-linked immun-  
odeficiency (xid) phenotype (35). Peripheral B cells in xid mice are present,  
albeit somewhat reduced in number, and are skewed toward an immature pheno-  
type, with an over-representation of IgM${}^{\text{high}}$IgD${}^{\text{low}}$ cells and a deficiency in the  
IgM${}^{\text{low}}$IgD${}^{\text{high}}$ class (Figure 1). Strikingly, the peritoneal B-1 B cell population  
is absent in xid mice. IgM${}^{\text{high}}$IgD${}^{\text{low}}$ peripheral xid B cells are refractory to BCR-  
mediated activation in vitro and fail to respond to thymus-independent type II  
(TI-II) antigens, indicating the involvement of Btk in BCR signaling (36, 37).  
The difference in phenotype between XLA and xid initially suggested the pos-  
sibility that the murine xid mutation may not be a complete loss-of-function  
allele. Analyses of null mutations in the mouse Btk (38, 39), however, proved  
that lack of Btk function indeed results in the xid phenotype, further confirming a  
selective disadvantage for Btk-deficient mice B cells during antigen-dependent  
development, but not during the pro-B to pre-B transition (40).

**CD45**

Protein tyrosine phosphorylation is controlled by the balance between activity  
of PTKs and that of protein tyrosine phosphatases. Particularly important in  
BCR signaling is the transmembrane tyrosine phosphatase CD45 and the SH2-  
containing protein SHP-1. CD45${}^{-/-}$ mice generate mature B cells but have  
perturbed B cell development, exhibiting a marked increase in IgM${}^{\text{high}}$IgD${}^{\text{low}}$  
(most normal mature B cells are IgM${}^{\text{low}}$IgD${}^{\text{high}}$) (41, 42). These findings led  
to the prevailing view that CD45 plays a positive role in B cell development.  
Supporting this view, the calcium influx from extracellular sources as well as  
BCR-induced proliferation is decreased in CD45${}^{-/-}$ mice (43). Mice carrying

transgenic BCRs (anti-HEL) were bred with CD45$^{-/-}$ mice, and B cell fates in the presence or absence of soluble antigen (HEL) were evaluated. Circulating HEL autoantigen mediated negative selection of mature CD45$^{+/+}$ HEL-binding B cells, whereas, in striking contrast, the autoantigen positively selected CD45$^{-/-}$ HEL-binding B cells, promoting their accumulation as long-lived IgM${}^{\text{low}}$IgD${}^{\text{high}}$ cells (44). The simple explanation for these results is that, even in the absence of CD45, a weak signal is induced by antigen, thereby promoting the maturation and/or survival of B cells. According to this model, mutations or genetic changes that reduce BCR signal strength, such as CD45$^{-/-}$, result in autoantibody production because they inhibit negative selection. It is also possible that the BCR couples to a qualitatively different signaling pathway in the absence of CD45, leading to increased maturation and survival of B cells.

**SHP**

In contrast to CD45$^{-/-}$ mice, B cell development and function are markedly abnormal in $me/me$ mice (SHP-1 null), resulting in hyper gammaglobulinemia and auto-antibody production. Motheaten viable ($me^{v}/me^{v}$) mice express a mutant SHP-1 that exhibits markedly decreased PTPase activity. Both strains exhibit the same spectrum of abnormalities, although $me/me$ mice have a more severe phenotype. In $me/me$ mice, B cell progenitors are depleted, and activated B cell and plasma cell populations are increased. In addition, there is a large increase in B1 cell numbers. Since SHP-1 is expressed in almost all hematopoietic cells, the abnormality of B cells in SHP-1$^{-/-}$ mice is presumably due to a mixture of both intrinsic defects within B cells and extrinsic effects of other hematopoietic cells on B cells (45–47). To circumvent these trans-effects on B cells, Cyster and Goodnow reconstituted irradiated mice by using a mixture of bone marrow cells (20% from $me^{v}/me^{v}$ cells and 80% from wild-type cells). This approach reduces trans effects from the overproduced $me^{v}/me^{v}$ mutant myeloid cells in irradiated mice (48). While SHP-1-deficient HEL-specific B cells developed normally in the bone marrow in the absence of HEL, the peripheral $me^{v}/me^{v}$ B cells were unusual, mimicking those of anergic wild-type B cells. However, in contrast to a profound desensitization of BCR signaling in anergic B cells, HEL antigen elicited a larger elevation of cytosolic calcium in SHP-1-deficient B cells, indicating that SHP-1 is a negative regulator of BCR signaling. More efficient elimination of self-reactive B cells (augmentation of negative selection) is due to this exaggerated signaling in SHP-1-deficient B cells. Thus, the production of auto-antibodies in $me^{v}/me^{v}$ mice is somewhat paradoxical. Given the evidence that the predominant source of auto-antibodies in $melme$ mice is the pool of B1-type B cells (45–47), this can be explained by a favored production of B1 cells through loss of SHP-1. The concept that SHP-1 and CD45 play a negative or positive role, respectively, for BCR signaling has been

further verified by analysis of CD45⁻/SHP-1⁻ mice. In these mice, defects of BCR signaling and development due to loss of CD45 were largely, but not completely, restored by the motheaten mutations (49).

# MODES OF PROTEIN-PROTEIN AND PROTEIN-LIPID INTERACTIONS

As mentioned above, one outcome of BCR signaling is to alter the phosphorylation state of tyrosine, serine, or threonine residues of target proteins. However, many protein kinases and protein phosphatases have relatively broad substrate specificities. Thus, mechanisms for ensuring the speed and precision of BCR signal transduction must exist to organize the correct repertoires of enzymes into the correct sites of action. This function can be achieved either by recruitment of active signaling molecules into signaling networks or activation of dormant enzymes already positioned close to their substrates (Figure 2). The recent discovery of protein modules that participate in protein-protein interactions has provided critical insights into these aspects of receptor-mediated signal transduction (50). The SH2 domain and PTB domain recognize phosphotyrosine (pTyr) followed by three to five C-terminal residues and pTyr preceded by

residues that form a $\beta$ turn, respectively (Figure 2). The importance of the SH2 domain is typified by the association of autophosphorylated receptor tyrosine kinases with cytoplasmic proteins that contain the SH2 domains. Once the receptor tyrosine kinase is autophosphorylated by ligand binding, proteins containing an SH2 domain are recruited to the phosphorylated receptor, leading to the assembly of complexes of signaling proteins around the activated receptor. Similarly, subcellular organization of serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases occurs through interactions with the targeting subunits or anchoring proteins that localize these enzymes. In addition, proteins such as AKAP79 (51) serve as signaling scaffolds of several kinases and phosphatases (Figure 2).

The SH3 domain contributes to protein-protein interactions by binding to proline-rich peptide sequences with the consensus PXXP, whereas the PH (pleckstrin homology) domain is involved in protein-lipid interactions. The PH domains bind the charged headgroups of specific polyphosphoinositides and thereby regulate the subcellular targeting of signaling proteins to specific regions of the plasma membrane (Figure 2). In this way, PH domains can couple the actions of phosphatidylinositol (PI) kinases, inositol phosphatases, and phospholipases to the regulation of intracellular signaling. Examples of these modular proteins involved in B cell function are depicted in Figure 3.

GENETICS OF B CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING 565

advances in our understanding of BCR signal transduction (discussed below) suggest how these protein–protein and protein–lipid interactions integrate trans- membrane events into B cell biological responses.

In addition to these signaling modules, specialized membrane fractions, called the DIG fraction or detergent-resistant membrane rafts, appear to be important for the integrity of signaling molecules around antigen receptors and their subsequent activity. The functional importance of this specialized membrane compartment in TCR signaling has been recently shown by using filipin and nystatin, compounds that disrupt the DIG fraction (52).

# ACTIVATION MECHANISMS OF PTKs

Kinetic experiments in B cells have shown that the increased activity of the Src-PTKs Blk, Lyn, and Fyn following BCR activation occurs before the increased activity of Btk and Syk (53), suggesting that it is the Src-PTKs that are initially activated through BCR signaling. In vitro binding studies showed that Lyn and Fyn, not Src, interact with the resting BCR (54). This differential association between Lyn/Fyn and Src might reflect binding to a membrane fraction through palmitoylation rather than protein–protein interactions, since Lyn and Fyn, but not Src, are palmitoylated at one or two Cys residues (position 3 or 5 from N-terminal) in addition to being myristoylated at their N termini. Indeed, the functional importance of palmitoylation of Lck has been demonstrated in the context of TCR signaling (55).

Targeted gene disruption of Lyn in the chicken B cell line DT40 results in a profound decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins upon BCR engagement. Since this particular cell line predominantly expresses Lyn among the Src family PTKs, this residual receptor-induced phosphorylation of cellular proteins is presumably attributable to Syk. In fact, the complementary pattern of the receptor-induced phosphorylation observed with the loss of Syk supports this contention (56). Lyn/Syk doubly deficient DT40 cells exhibit no tyrosine phosphorylation induced by BCR cross-linking (57). Hence, two important conclusions can be drawn from these data; Lyn and Syk are the PTKs initially activated by BCR signaling, and these PTKs can be activated independently of each other, at least to some extent. That Syk is activated independently of Lyn is in marked contrast to TCR signaling in which the Syk homologue Zap-70 is activated downstream of Src-PTKs such as Lck, implicating distinct activating modes by Syk and Zap-70 (discussed below).

The activities of Src-PTKs are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation; autophosphorylation of Tyr416 within the Src catalytic domain is stimulatory, and carboxy-terminal phosphorylation of Tyr527 is inhibitory (58). Phosphorylation of Tyr527 mediates an intramolecular association with the kinase’s own SH2 domain, leading to a conformation that represses its kinase activity.

The phosphorylation of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine is regulated by Csk and CD45. This concept is verified by the observations that the C-terminal tyrosine of Lyn is hyperphosphorylated in CD45-deficient DT40 cells (59) and CD45− J558 plasmacytoma (60), while this tyrosine is hypophosphorylated in Csk-deficient DT40 cells (61). As the extent of receptor-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates is significantly increased by loss of Csk (61) and decreased by loss of CD45 (59, 62, 63), it appears that the strength of BCR signaling is regulated through the balance between Csk and CD45 activities by determining the phosphorylation state of the carboxy-terminal tyrosine of the Src-PTKs. However, even in the absence of CD45, a weak signal such as a low level of calcium mobilization can be observed (43, 59), suggesting that Syk is still activated despite the downregulation of Src-PTKs.

Although many studies indicate that CD45 plays a positive role in BCR signaling, negative effects of CD45 were also observed. CD45-negative variants of WEHI-231 cells show increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins at the resting level and an augmented calcium response upon BCR stimulation (64). These discrepancies suggest that CD45 has both positive and negative roles in BCR signaling and that the balance of these opposite effects varies depending upon the distinct developmental stage of B cells and/or distinct CD45 isoforms and/or level of expression of CD45.

Crystal structure analyses of Src-family PTKs reveal that the SH3 domain recognizes the linker region between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain (65, 66). Thus, two interactions, between the SH2 domain and phosphorylated Tyr527, and between the SH3 domain and the SH2-kinase linker region, are thought to be involved in keeping Src kinase in the inactive state. Activation of the kinase would presumably lead to the sequential dissociation of the SH2 and SH3 domains from their intramolecular ligands, removing these constraints. Thus, in addition to dephosphorylation of Tyr527, which is likely to be the key regulatory switch, more potent exogenous ligands for the SH2 or SH3 domain may compete for endogenous binding, thereby disrupting the inactive structure. Thus, in the case of BCR signaling, although the initial activation mechanism of Lyn is still unclear, the initially phosphorylated substrate would then bind the SH2 domain of Lyn, which could stimulate enzyme activity, thereby promoting processive phosphorylation.

The mechanism of Syk activation has been extensively examined. Weiss and Littman initially proposed a sequential activation model, based on the cooperativity between Lck and Zap-70 in T cells (67). Most of the observations to date in B cells support that this mechanism also operates in B cells. According to this model, BCR engagement leads to phosphorylation of the Igα/Igβ ITAMs by Src-PTKs. Then Syk is recruited to the doubly-phosphorylated ITAM and is activated by Src-PTK phosphorylation (Figure 4). Detailed biochemical (68)

and genetic studies (69, 70), however, have underscored the existence of an additional activating mode of Syk that is independent of Src-PTKs.

What are the underlying mechanisms that explain Src-PTK independent activation of Syk? Since association of Syk with the BCR complex is observed before receptor stimulation (71), receptor aggregation might directly stimulate the activity of the pre-associated Syk. An important mechanism of Syk activation is phosphorylation of the tyrosine located in the kinase activation loop, and the failure of Syk mutant (Tyr519 to Phe) to activate BCR signaling (72). This phosphorylation is probably mediated by autophosphorylation as well as Src-PTKs. Consistent with this notion, the kinase activity of Syk, but not Zap-70, is reported to be activated when bound to doubly-phosphorylated (dp)-ITAMs of Igα-Igβ (73). Thus, binding of Syk to the dp-ITAM may bring Syk into a state that is more susceptible to autophosphorylation, resulting in an increase in Syk specific activity. The existence of the coiled-coiled loop between the two SH2 domains, revealed by crystallographic analysis (74), might provide the structural basis for this concept. Syk binding to dp-ITAM may induce a conformational change of this coiled-coiled region, allowing its interaction with the kinase domain to alter enzymatic activity. The binding affinity of two SH2 domains to dp-ITAMs of Igα/Igβ, partially mediated by the region between the C-terminal SH2 domain and the kinase domain (75), also appears to be involved in the enzymatic activation of Syk.

Although Syk is activated in the absence of Src-PTKs, the positive effects of Src-PTKs on Syk are clear. In fact, BCR-induced activation of Syk is dramatically inhibited by loss of Lyn in DT40B cells (76). Hence, under physiological conditions, BCR ligation activates Src-PTKs as well as a pre-associated Syk, leading to phosphorylation of ITAMs in Igα-Igβ, and the subsequent recruitment of Syk. Then recruited Syk is activated by Src-PTK-dependent transphosphorylation and by autophosphorylation.

The Tyr130 residue of Syk is autophosphorylated by activated Syk, and this phosphorylation may, in turn, lead to termination of Syk activation in BCR signaling (77). Tyr130 is located between the N-terminal and C-terminal Syk SH2 domains, the phosphorylation of which is important in mediating release of Syk from the BCR complex. Phosphorylation of Tyr130 may induce conformational changes of the Syk SH2 domains, leading to a low-affinity state of Syk with (dp)-ITAMs of Igα-Igβ. Another possibility is that a protein containing SH2 domain binds to the phosphorylated tyrosine, sequestering Syk from the receptor complex. In the mast cell system, overexpression of Cbl blocks Syk assembly from the activated FcεRI and blocks the enzymatic activity of Syk (78). Recent analysis of Cbl⁻/⁻ mice also supports the negative role of Cbl in Syk/Zap-70 function (79). There seem to exist two additional mechanisms that allow Syk to be turned off. One potential mechanism is that tyrosine

phosphatases such as SHP-1 mediate dephosphorylation of the Tyr519 residue. Another mechanism may be analogous to the JAK kinase inhibitor CIS (80– 82). SH2 containing proteins like CIS may bind to phosphorylated Syk after BCR stimulation, leading to inhibition of Syk enzymatic activity by inducing conformational changes of Syk.

As increased activity of Btk follows the increased activity of Src-PTKs upon receptor cross-linking, it has been proposed that Btk is activated by Src-PTK- mediated phosphorylation (53). In COS cells and fibroblasts, Btk is phosphorylated and activated by cotransfection with Src-PTKs (83, 84). The requirement for Src-PTKs in BTK activation was reexamined in the context of BCR signaling. In Lyn-deficient DT40B cells, the BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk still occurred despite delayed time kinetics. In contrast, sustained Btk phosphorylation was clearly inhibited in Syk-deficient DT40 cells (85). A simple explanation of these results is the existence of two phases of tyrosine phosphorylation of Btk in BCR signaling: the initial phase and the sustained phase, mediated by Lyn and Syk, respectively. Supporting this conclusion, BCR-mediated phosphorylation of Btk in Blk/Lyn double-deficient splenic B cells was comparable to that in wild-type cells (86).

In fibroblasts, Btk is activated through Src-PTK-dependent transphosphorylation of Tyr551, which is in the activation loop of the catalytic domain of Btk (83, 84). This results in a five- to tenfold increase in Btk enzymatic activity, subsequently leading to autophosphorylation at Tyr223 in the SH3 domain (87) (Figure 4). In B cells, Tyr551 and Tyr223 are also phosphorylated in response to BCR stimulation. Although it still remains unresolved which PTK(s) phosphorylates Tyr551 in B cells, transphosphorylation of Tyr551 is essential for participation of Btk in BCR signal transduction (85). Recent crystallographic analysis of Itk (a Btk/Tec family PTK expressed in T cells) shows the existence of an intramolecular interaction between the proline-rich region and the SH3 domain of Itk (88). Based on this structure, Schreiber et al proposed the existence of an equilibrium between an intramolecular, “closed”

**Figure 4** Model for PLC-$\gamma$2 activation upon BCR engagement. (A) BCR ligation activates Lyn, leading to tyrosine phosphorylation of ITAMs within the Ig$\alpha$-Ig$\beta$ subunits of the BCR. Then, Syk is recruited to phosphorylated ITAMs. PI-3,4,5-P$_3$, a product of activated PI3-K, recruits Btk to membrane fraction by its binding to Btk PH domain. (B) Activated Lyn phosphorylates the tyrosine in the activation loop of Syk and Btk (Tyr519 of Syk and Tyr551 of Btk), so leading to their activation. (C) Activated Syk phosphorylates BLNK and thereby brings BLNK to the membrane fraction, eventually leading to co-localization of Syk, BLNK, and Btk. The membrane-associated Btk might be further recruited to phosphorylated BLNK by using the Btk SH2 domain.

complex and intermolecular, “open” complex in which Itk SH3 and SH2 domains are occupied by bidentate cellular ligands. Indeed, a novel protein, Sab, which preferentially associates with the Btk SH3 domain, has been recently cloned (89), and this molecule is able to inhibit Btk enzymatic activity upon its binding to Btk. This suggests that Sab functions as a trans-inhibitor for Btk (T Yamadori, Y Baba, T Kurosaki, M Matsushita, S Hashimoto, T Kishimoto, S Tsukada, submitted). Interestingly, Tyr223 of Btk is located within the interface of the interaction between the SH3 domain and the proline-rich region. Thus, an intriguing possibility is that phosphorylation of Tyr223 may disrupt this intramolecular interaction, thereby exposing binding sites for association with other signaling molecules.

In addition to regulation by phosphorylation, other mechanisms of Btk regulation have been identified. Btk interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate through its PH domain, an interaction that is required for recruitment of Btk to membrane fractions (90–92). Since phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI-3,4,5-P₃) is generated by PI3-K, Btk is targeted to the plasma membrane after PI3-K activation, thereby rendering Btk susceptible to transphosphorylation at Tyr551 by Lyn and Syk (Figure 4).

## EFFECTOR SYSTEMS

### Lipid Metabolizing Enzymes

One of the critical downstream events following PTK activation is activation of lipid-metabolizing enzymes such as PLC-γ and PI3-K. In the case of the receptor PTKs, such as the PDGF receptor, receptor autophosphorylation sites direct the binding of PLC-γ1 to the activated receptor, whereupon PLC-γ1 becomes tyrosine phosphorylated and activated. Similar to this mechanism, PLC-γ1 is tyrosine phosphorylated after recruitment through its SH2 domains to phosphorylated Tyr341 and Tyr345 of Syk in COS cells (93). However, the Syk mutant (Tyr341/345 to Phe) was still able to activate PLC-γ2 in Syk-deficient DT40 cells (H Adachi, M Kurosaki, T Kurosaki, unpublished data). Since the SH2 domains of PLC-γ2 are essential for its activation (94), these data raise a question about the phosphorylated target molecule of the PLC-γ2 SH2 domains in B cells. Candidate molecules include BLNK (alternatively named SLP-65) (95, 96) and/or a B cell homologue of LAT (97, 98), as PLC-γ2 and PLC-γ1 are recruited to phosphorylated BLNK in B cells and to phosphorylated LAT in T cells, respectively.

BCR-induced BLNK phosphorylation is apparently mediated by Syk, since BLNK phosphorylation is lost in Syk-deficient DT40 cells (95). BLNK has a structural domain similar to SLP-76 (99), in that it contains an N-terminal basic region with several tyrosine phosphorylation sites and a C-terminal SH2

domain (Figure 3). SLP-76 is expressed in T cells, NK cells, and mast cells, whereas BLNK is expressed only in B cells. BLNK associates with PLC-$\gamma$1/2, Grb2, Vav, and Nck by SH2-phosphotyrosine interactions, suggesting the possibility that BLNK is a central linker molecule in bridging Syk with downstream effector functions including PLC-$\gamma$2 activation (95). In fact, BCR-induced PLC-$\gamma$2 activation was abrogated in BLNK-deficient DT40 cells, and this defect was bypassed by expression of PLC-$\gamma$2 as a membrane-associated form (M Ishiai, M Kurosaki, R Pappu, K Ohkawa, I Ronko, C Fu, A Iwamatsu, AC Chan, T Kurosaki, *Immunity*, in press) (Figure 4). LAT, a recently cloned adaptor molecule in T cells, consists of 223 amino acids with a putative transmembrane domain at the N-terminus. Although LAT contains no regions homologous to SH2, SH3, and PH domains, it contains several tyrosines predicted to mediate interactions with the SH2 domains of Grb2 and PLC-$\gamma$1 (97, 98). Northern analysis demonstrates that LAT is expressed predominantly in T cells, NK cells, and mast cells but not in B cells, which correlates well with the expression pattern of SLP-76. It is possible that a homologue of LAT may exist in B cells. Thus, a complex of this LAT homologue and BLNK may participate in targeting PLC-$\gamma$2 to the plasma membrane.

Genetic analysis reveals a more complicated story for PLC-$\gamma$2 activation upon BCR stimulation. Deletion of Btk in DT40 cells eliminates PLC-$\gamma$2 activation through inhibition of phosphorylation of PLC-$\gamma$2 (57), indicating that Btk, as well as Syk, is required for tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of PLC-$\gamma$2. Supporting the importance of the Btk/Tec family in PLC-$\gamma$ activation, B cells from XLA patients (100) and Itk$^{-/-}$ T cells (101) showed a profound reduction in IP$_3$ production upon BCR and TCR engagement, respectively. Although the precise mechanism for the requirement for Syk and Btk is still unclear, these two PTKs could be required to phosphorylate PLC-$\gamma$2 on distinct sites that are collectively required for activation. Alternatively, one kinase may be responsible for the phosphorylation that activates PLC-$\gamma$2 and the other may be responsible for directing PLC-$\gamma$2 to the plasma membrane. The former possibility appears more likely because both Syk- and Btk-deficient DT40 cells show inhibition of PLC-$\gamma$2 tyrosine phosphorylation upon BCR engagement (Figure 4).

An effect of the PI3-K pathway on PLC-$\gamma$2 activation via two distinct mechanisms has been envisaged by recent reports. One mechanism is that PI-3,4,5-P$_3$ is indirectly involved in PLC-$\gamma$2 activation through its binding to the Btk PH domain and subsequent Btk activation (Figure 4). Indeed, cotransfection of the PI3-K p110 subunit and Btk increased PLC-$\gamma$2 tyrosine phosphorylation and its activation (100). The second possibility is that the PLC-$\gamma$2 PH domain binds to PI-3,4,5-P$_3$ thereby being recruited to the plasma membrane, since the PLC-$\gamma$1 PH domain binds preferentially to PI-3,4,5-P$_3$ (102).

572 KUROSAKI

Not only PI3-K, but also phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PIP-5K) has been proposed to contribute to PLC-$\gamma$2 activation because PIP-5K synthesizes the available substrate PI-4,5-P$_2$ for PLC-$\gamma$2. Since Vav1-activated Rac has been shown to interact with PIP-5K in other cell systems, Vav1 may participate in BCR signaling by generating PI-4,5-P$_2$ through PIP-5K activation (103).

PLC-$\gamma$2 activation leads to hydrolysis of phospholipid, yielding IP$_3$ and DAG. IP$_3$ binds IP$_3$ receptors (IP$_3$Rs) located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), leading to calcium release from internal stores (94). Triple knockout of three IP$_3$R isoforms abolishes BCR-induced calcium mobilization both from internal stores and from extracellular sources, whereas this overall calcium mobilization is still observed by single knockouts of these receptors (104). Thus, three IP$_3$R isoforms are essential and functionally redundant mediators for overall BCR-induced calcium mobilization. These data support the capacitative model for calcium entry in which calcium influx across the plasma membrane is coupled to depletion of intracellular calcium stores (Figure 5). Although expression of only one isoform does not abolish calcium mobilization upon BCR ligation, detailed calcium signaling patterns differ significantly among these three IP$_3$R isoforms. For instance, DT40B cells expressing only type 2 IP$_3$R showed regular and robust Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations upon receptor ligation, whereas monophasic Ca$^{2+}$ transient or rapidly damped Ca$^{2+}$ oscillations were observed in mutant cells expressing either type 3 or type 1 alone, respectively (T Miyakawa, A Maeda, T Yamazawa, K Hirose, T Kurosaki, M Iino, submitted). Thus, differential and combinatorial expression of three IP$_3$R isoforms appears to be one of the critical determinants for spatiotemporal Ca$^{2+}$ signals, which in turn regulate the selectivity of transcription factors in B cells (105–107).

IP$_3$R channel activity may be modulated by phosphorylation. In fact, IP$_3$R has been suggested to be a substrate of Src-PTKs in antigen receptor signaling, since TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of the IP$_3$R is reduced in Fyn$^{-/-}$ mice. Moreover, IP$_3$R channel activity is increased by addition of Src-PTKs in vitro (108).

BCR engagement generates the PI3,4,5-P$_3$ product (109), indicating that the activation of PI3-K occurs in BCR signaling. The PI-3K inhibitor wortmannin blocks anti-Ig-induced growth inhibition of a human B cell line (110). As this growth arrest and/or BCR-induced apoptosis are thought to mimic one mechanism of BCR-induced tolerance of B cells, these data suggest that the PI-3K pathway modulates B cell tolerance.

BCR stimulation induces tyrosine phosphorylation of the BCR-associated CD19 molecule. This phosphorylation occurs on sites that interact with the p85 regulatory subunit of PI-3K via its SH2 domains (111). Phosphorylation

of CD19 is greatly enhanced when the antigen is decorated with C3d fragments resulting from activation of the complement cascade. The resulting coligation of the BCR with CD19 promotes the ability of CD19 to recruit PI3-K, thereby leading to activation of PI3-K kinase activity. In addition to this mechanism, a proline-rich region of the p85 subunit binds to the SH3 domains of Lyn and Fyn, leading to an increase in PI3-K activity. Indeed, the BCR-induced activation of PI3-K is blocked by a peptide containing this proline-rich region (112). Thus, one hypothesis is that multimeric protein complexes are formed upon BCR ligation in which PI3-K is simultaneously bound to CD19 and to Fyn or Lyn, resulting in maximal PI3-K activation.

Various PH domain-containing molecules including Vav, Btk, and PLC-γ 1 selectively bind PI3,4,5-P₃, a product of PI3-K activity. This binding appears to contribute to conformational modification of these signaling molecules as well as their recruitment to the plasma membrane. After PI3,4,5-P₃ generation by activated PI3-K, a rapid and prolonged elevation of PI3,4-P₂ occurs following BCR cross-linking (109). This PI3,4-P₂ could be the result of phosphorylation of PI4-P by PI3-K, or alternatively it could result from the removal of the 5′ phosphate of PI3,4,5-P₃. The importance of the latter mechanism is suggested by the fact that SHIP, an enzyme capable of catalyzing this reaction, is a prominent substrate of BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation. This SH2 domain-containing inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase (SHIP) was initially identified by virtue of its association with Shc upon stimulation of antigen receptors and cytokine receptors (113). SHIP is thought to exert two effects on the PI-3K pathway; it acts to decrease the amount of PI3,4,5-P₃ and to increase its conversion to PI3,4-P₂. This prediction was directly examined by studying SHIP-deficient DT40 B cells. These cells demonstrated enhanced PI3,4,5-P₃ production upon BCR ligation. Furthermore, SHIP-deficient B cells exhibited sustained Ca²⁺ increase or long lasting Ca²⁺ oscillations upon receptor stimulation (181). Hyperactivation of the ITAM-bearing receptor FcεRI was also observed in SHIP⁻/⁻ mice (114). These mice exhibit increased numbers of granulocyte-macrophage progenitors, due to hyper-responsiveness to stimulation via cytokine receptors such as macrophage-colony stimulating factor and IL3 receptors. In contrast, the number of B220 positive B cells in the bone marrow was significantly decreased, presumably due to trans-effects from overproduced SHIP⁻/⁻ myeloid cells. This phenotype is similar to that of *me*/*me* mice, raising the intriguing question of whether SHP-1 and SHIP function independently within the same pathway or in an overlapping manner.

In contrast to hyper-calcium responses in SHIP-deficient B cells, wortmannin treatment blocks BCR-induced calcium influx (115). Thus, following calcium mobilization from the ER by PLC-γ 2-evoked IP₃, a capacitative process is regulated by the PI3-K pathway, leading to calcium influx from extracellular

Figure 5 Two models for BCR-induced calcium influx. (A) Level of IP₃ generation, regulated by Btk and Syk, influences the state of emptiness of intracellular calcium stores such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stores. Sustained elevation of IP₃ results in progressive depletion of ER stores, efficiently coupling ER store to opening of calcium channels on the plasma membrane (CRAC channels). This model was proposed by Scharenberg and Kinet (180), based on the observations that Btk-deficient B cells generate less IP₃ than wild-type cells and thereby not allowing ER stores to be fully depleted, leading to inefficient coupling to CRAC channels. (B) In addition to the effect of Btk on sustained IP₃ generation, Btk participates in the process to opening of CRAC channels.

sources. Moreover, based on the evidence that wortmannin-mediated inhibition of calcium influx can be restored by active Btk (116), it has been proposed that PI-3,4,5-P₃-activated Btk participates in calcium influx by regulating depletion of intracellular calcium stores and/or calcium influx channels (Figure 5B). Uncovering the molecular mechanisms and identification of calcium channels in the plasma membrane will be important, since the amplitude and duration of BCR-induced Ca²⁺ control the differential activation of transcription factors (105).

### GTP-Binding Proteins

Ras is maximally stimulated within one to two minutes after receptor ligation, as indicated by its transition from the RasGDP to the RasGTP state. A dominant-negative transgene (Ras N17) expressed in B cells under the control of the Eμ enhancer arrests B cell development before the pre-BCR dependent stage (117). This phenotype is similar to that of mice lacking the high affinity IL-7 receptor α chain, suggesting that Ras is required for IL-7 to drive B cell development. Nevertheless, some leaky mature B cells emerge in transgenic

mice expressing Ras N17, and these cells exhibit inhibition of BCR-induced proliferation. Thus, one explanation is that a Ras-dependent signal is required at various B cell developmental stages, presumably reflecting its requirement in various receptor systems including the IL-7 receptor and the BCR.

Sos, a nucleotide exchange factor for Ras, is present in the cytosol in the resting state, where it does not efficiently activate the membrane-bound Ras molecule. Since forced localization of Sos to the plasma membrane is sufficient to activate Ras (118), it is thought that Ras is activated by inducing the translocation of Sos to the membrane fraction. Several coupling molecules, including Shc, Grb2, and Cbl, have been implicated in Sos translocation. Shc-deficient DT40B cells exhibited normal ERK activation, whereas this ERK activation was inhibited by loss of Grb2 or expression of dominant-negative Ras, suggesting the dispensability of Shc for Ras activation (119). Grb2 consists of one SH2 domain and two SH3 domains (Figure 3). The former domain can bind to tyrosine phosphorylated molecules such as the B cell LAT homologue, leading to Grb2 recruitment to the membrane fraction, while the SH3 domains can interact with the proline-rich regions in Sos. Since ERK activation was completely abrogated in Syk-deficient B cells (120), phosphorylation of the Grb2-associated molecule is presumably mediated by Syk.

In contrast to the positive role of Grb2 in the Ras pathway, a negative role of Cbl through two distinct mechanisms has been proposed. Cbl is a 120-kDa protein with a variety of protein motifs, including multiple proline-rich SH3-binding sites and multiple tyrosines (Figure 3), the phosphorylation of which could promote binding to several SH2-containing proteins including CrkL. The first mechanism for involvement of Cbl in the Ras pathway is via Rap1. CrkL constitutively associates with the Rap1-specific exchange factor C3G by an interaction mediated by the SH3 domain of C3G. This CrkL-C3G complex is linked to BCR signaling by binding of CrkL via an SH2 domain to tyrosine phosphorylated Cbl (121, 122). Thus, BCR stimulation could promote formation of the Cbl-CrkL-C3G complex, thereby allowing Rap1 activation. Rap1 appears to negatively regulate Ras signaling pathways by competing for binding to Ras effectors such as Raf, thereby preventing their activation by GTP-bound Ras (123). The second mechanism is via competition for binding to Sos. The binding of Sos and Cbl to Grb2 is mutually exclusive, as the proline-rich regions of these proteins compete for the same binding site in the Grb2 SH3 domain (124). Thus, Cbl may negatively regulate the Ras pathway by inhibition of Sos recruitment to the membrane fraction. BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl is abrogated in Lyn-deficient DT40 cells (125), suggesting that Cbl is a substrate of Lyn. In contrast to this report, Syk was shown to mediate tyrosine phosphorylation of Cbl upon FcεRI cross-linking (126), indicating that Cbl may be a substrate for both Src-PTK and

Syk with the relative contribution of each kinase varying in different cellular systems.

Ras is downregulated following interaction with the Ras-GTPase activating protein, RasGAP. BCR stimulation results in tyrosine phosphorylation of RasGAP, and the GTPase activating activity of RasGAP appears to be decreased by tyrosine phosphorylation (127, 128). In addition, BCR stimulation leads to tyrosine phosphorylation of two proteins, of 190 kDa and 62 kDa, which then associate with RasGAP. The p190 protein turns out to be a GAP for the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, and thus its association with RasGAP may reflect a coordinated regulation of Ras and Rho GTP-binding families (129). The p62<sup>dok</sup> protein was recently cloned, and this protein contains a PH domain (130, 131). Current models for the involvement of p62<sup>dok</sup> in the regulation of Rho family GTPases are based on the assumption that tyrosine phosphorylation of p62<sup>dok</sup> will modulate the cellular distribution of associated RasGAP and RhoGAP and sequester these negative regulators away from active Ras and Rac, thereby prolonging the activation of Rac and Rho effector pathways.

Vav1 is a 95-kDa guanine nucleotide exchange protein with selectivity for Rac. Vav1<sup>-/-</sup> mice display normal numbers and differentiation of B cells in the bone marrow and normal B cell populations in peripheral lymph nodes, but reduced number of B1 B cells in the peritoneal cavity. BCR-induced proliferation and calcium mobilization of peripheral Vav1-deficient B cells are compromised (132–136). Thus, even in the absence of Vav1, a sufficient signal for conventional (B2) B cell growth is provided, but the signal strength is below the threshold necessary for proliferation of B1 B cells. Since several reports have shown that Rac regulates JNK activation (137), the apparently normal JNK activation upon BCR engagement in Vav1<sup>-/-</sup> mice was somewhat surprising. The simple explanation is that the physiological function of Vav1 in lymphocytes is related not to JNK activation but rather to cytoskeletal regulation and calcium mobilization. Supporting this view, treatment of T cells with cytochalasin D, which blocks actin polymerization, produced defects in TCR signaling nearly identical to those observed in Vav1<sup>-/-</sup> mice (136). Another possibility is that the Vav1<sup>-/-</sup> phenotype could be accounted for by a functional redundancy of Vav1 and Vav2.

Similar to recruitment of Vav1 to Zap-70 in T cells (138), Vav1 is recruited to the phosphorylated Tyr341 and Tyr345 of Syk through its SH2 domain and is subsequently phosphorylated in B cells (139). Bustelo and co-workers have presented evidence that tyrosine phosphorylated Vav1, not the nonphosphorylated form, catalyzes GDP/GTP exchange on Rac-1 (137). In addition to regulation of Vav1 by tyrosine phosphorylation, PI-3,4,5,-P<sub>3</sub>, a product of PI3-K activity, might be involved in Vav1 recruitment to the membrane fraction, since the PH domain of Vav1 selectively binds PI-3,4,5-P<sub>3</sub>. Interestingly, this lipid product

GENETICS OF B CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING 577

contributes to allosteric modification of GDP/GTP exchange activity of Vav1, thereby potentiating tyrosine-dependent enhancement of GDP/GTP exchange activity (140). Apart from these mechanisms, coligation of BCR and CD19 recruits Vav1 to the phosphorylated Tyr391 of CD19, leading eventually to membrane localization of Vav1.

In fibroblasts, Rho GTPases including Rho, Rac, and Cdc42 coordinate the dynamic organization of the actin cytoskeleton and the assembly of focal adhesions. Cdc42 can regulate T cell polarization toward APCs, a process critical for efficient APC-T cell contact and subsequent cytokine release. The importance of Cdc42 has been highlighted by the observation that the genetic defect in patients with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) maps to an effector protein for Cdc42, termed WASP. WAS is an X-linked hereditary immunodeficiency, characterized by thrombocytopenia and abnormal humoral- and cell-mediated immunity; defects include cytoskeletal and cell-activation abnormalities in lymphocytes (141). WASP can interact not only with Cdc42 (142), but also with PI-4,5-P₂ and several SH3-containing proteins through its N-terminal PH domain and central proline-rich domain, respectively (141). One of these SH3-containing proteins is Btk, which is able to phosphorylate WASP in vitro, suggesting that WASP may be a potential substrate of Btk in B cells (Y Baba, S Nonoyama, M Matsushita, T Yamadori, S Hashimoto, K Imai, S Arai, T Kunikata, M Kurimoto, T Kurosaki, H Ochs, J Yata, T Kishimoto, S Tsukada, submitted).

## Serine-Threonine Kinases and Phosphatases

One event downstream of the activation of lipid metabolizing enzymes and GTP binding proteins is activation of serine-threonine kinases and phosphatases. IP₃ and DAG, generated by PLC-γ2 activation, evoke calcium mobilization and PKC activation, respectively. Calcium elevation leads to the activation of both calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II and the calmodulin-activated serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, the latter of which is the target of cyclosporin A and FK506 (143). One of the targets regulated by calcium elevation is the transcription factor NF-AT whose nuclear translocation is facilitated through its dephosphorylation by calcineurin (144, 145). The BCR-induced apoptosis of WEHI-231 cells and proliferation of splenic B cells are inhibited by cyclosporin A, indicating the importance of calcineurin for these responses (146, 147). Both phosphatases, and kinases that regulate cytoplasmic-nuclear localization of NF-AT have been identified. Cytoplasmic NF-AT is phosphorylated on the serine proline (SP) repeats and serine-rich region (SRR) by the coordinated activity of casein kinase Iα and MEKK1-mediated kinase (148), thereby masking the activity of nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). Dephosphorylation of NF-AT by calcineurin leads to an alteration

in an intramolecular interaction, exposing NLSs to the nuclear import machinery (149). Moreover, glycogen synthase-3 (GSK-3) has been shown to phosphorylate serine residues necessary for nuclear export, promoting nuclear exit of NF-AT (150).

Tyrosine phosphorylation as well as serine phosphorylation may affect cytoplasmic-nuclear localization of transcription factors. HS1 possesses features that are characteristic of a transcription factor, namely, a putative nuclear localization signal and a motif composed of basic amino acids that resembles a DNA-binding protein. A variant WEHI B lymphoma line that is resistant to BCR-induced apoptosis exhibits a low level of HS1 expression, and transfection of HS1 into this variant B cell line restores apoptosis (151). BCR stimulation evokes HS1 phosphorylation on several Tyr residues, among which Tyr378 and Tyr397 are critical for inducing apoptosis as well as for HS1 translocation to the nucleus (152). Thus, it is speculated that phosphorylation at these tyrosines allows HS1 to be transported to the nucleus, where HS1 participates in the transcriptional regulation of target genes involved in apoptosis.

Protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms expressed in B cells include $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, $\varepsilon$, $\eta$, and $\theta$, of which $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\delta$, $\varepsilon$ and $\theta$ are regulated by DAG, a product of PLC-$\gamma 2$ activity. Similar to xid mice, PKC$\beta$/II-deficient mice have a reduced number of mature B cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, barely detectable B-1 cells, and they are unable to mount a humoral immune response to thymus-independent type II (TI-II) antigens. Furthermore, BCR-mediated proliferation of PKC$\beta^{-/-}$ B cell is significantly reduced, again similar to xid mice, placing PKC$\beta$ and Btk along the same signaling pathway (153). No significant change in BCR-induced Btk activation between PKC$\beta^{-/-}$ and wild-type mice was noted. This finding, together with the evidence that PLC-$\gamma 2$ activation is inhibited by loss of Btk (57), suggests that Btk is upstream of PKC$\beta$ in BCR signaling. Another PKC isoform, PKC$\mu$, is reported to associate with the BCR. Furthermore, BCR stimulation leads to markedly increased PKC$\mu$ activity, which is a downstream event of PLC-$\gamma 2$ activation (154). Phosphorylation of Syk by PKC$\mu$ decreases the ability of Syk to phosphorylate PLC-$\gamma 1$ in vitro, implying that PKC$\mu$ may play a negative feedback role in the PLC-$\gamma$ pathway.

A link between the PI3-K pathway and Akt activation is emerging. PI3,4-P$_2$ activates the serine/threonine protein kinase Akt, through binding to the PH domain of Akt (PKB) (155, 156), so SHIP may stimulate Akt activation by generating this lipid product. However, recent identification of the serine/threonine kinase PDK1 that acts upstream of Akt has made this scenario more complicated. PDK1 is stimulated by PI3,4,5-P$_3$, not by PI3,4,-P$_2$, and this activated PDK1 phosphorylates Akt on Thr 308, leading to Akt activation (157). Thus, it appears that both binding to PI3,4-P$_2$ and phosphorylation by PI3,4,5-P$_3$-triggered PDK1 are required for Akt activation. One of the targets

of Akt is glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3); activated Akt phosphorylates GSK3, leading to inactivation of GSK3 kinase activity (158). NF-AT nuclear translocation is regulated by inhibiting its export through inactivation of GSK3. Thus, Akt activation could eventually lead to enhancing NF-AT nuclear localization by inactivation of GSK3 activity (150).

In more recent studies, Bad has been identified as a potential target of Akt, linking the PI3K pathway directly to the apoptotic machinery. The Bcl-2 family of related proteins contains protein–protein interaction domains that facilitate homo- and heterodimerization. Overexpression of some members (Bcl-2, Bcl-X<sub>L</sub>) in some systems promotes cell survival, whereas others (Bax and Bad) promote cell death. Bad dimerizes with Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> and Bcl-2 through interaction of the BH3 domain of Bad. Phosphorylation of Bad, mediated by Akt, promotes association with the 14-3-3 family proteins, which may promote survival by allowing heterodimerization of Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> with Bax, thereby preventing the pro-apoptotic function of Bax (159, 160). According to this model, PI-3K pathway transmits the anti-apoptotic signal through phosphorylation of Bad, and this signaling model could account for the fact that wortmannin blocks anti-Ig-induced growth inhibition, as discussed above.

The MAPK cascades constitute a group of signal transduction pathways characterized by successive phosphorylation of coupled serine/threonine or dual specificity kinases. The conserved signaling modules consist of a mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), a MAPK kinase (MAPKK), normally a dual-specificity kinase that phosphorylates MAPK on threonine and tyrosine residues, and a MAPKK kinase (MAPKKK), which phosphorylates MAPKK on serine and activates it. The best characterized MAPK pathway is the ERK pathway. This pathway receives a primary signal from Ras-GTP, which binds directly to Raf-1, the MAPKKK in this cascade. Activated Raf phosphorylates and activates MEK-1 and MEK-2 (the MAPKK), which both in turn phosphorylate ERK-1 and ERK-2. Phosphorylated ERKs form dimers, a step required for nuclear translocation and the subsequent phosphorylation of transcriptional regulatory proteins, including Fos, Jun, and members of the Ets family (161). Supporting the notion that Raf acts downstream of Ras, transgenic mice harboring a B cell–specific dominant-negative Ras were rescued by introducing constitutively active Raf.

Although Ras appears to be critical for ERK activation in BCR signaling, stimulation of PKC with phorbol esters can also promote ERK activation. This pharmacological evidence was further strengthened by the genetic data that BCR-induced ERK activation was significantly inhibited in PLC-γ2-deficient DT40 B cells (119) (Figure 6).

Unlike the ERK pathway, the JNK (SAPK) pathway is regulated by the small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42. The JNK cascade elements

are positioned in a conventional signaling cascade involving MKK1 (the MAPKKK), SEK1 (the MAPKK) and JNK. Among the targets of this cascade are the transcriptional factors c-Jun and ATF-2. JNK activation is inhibited by cyclosporine and loss of IP3 receptors, suggesting that this cascade requires calcium-sensitive calcineurin activity (119, 162). Furthermore, in addition to calcium, a particular PKC isoform, PKCθ (163), has been recently shown to participate in JNK activation (Figure 6).

Regulation of the p38 kinase is also achieved through a serine kinase cascade and the small GTP-binding proteins Rac1 and Cdc42. Unlike the requirement for both PKC and calcium in JNK activation, maximum p38 activation appears to require only PKC, not calcium (119) (Figure 6). Although the precise physiological substrates of this cascade are unknown, p38 can phosphorylate ATF-2 and another kinase, MAPK-activated protein kinase 2, and its activation has been correlated with BCR-induced apoptosis.

GENETICS OF B CELL ANTIGEN RECEPTOR SIGNALING 581

# MODULATION OF BCR SIGNALING BY CELL-SURFACE CO-RECEPTORS

An area of intense investigation in the last three years has been the involvement of multiple transmembrane proteins in regulating the strength and quality of the BCR signal. B cell activation by the BCR is modified by co-receptors such as CD19, CD22, PIR-B, and FcγRII. Since phosphorylation of these co-receptors by ITAM-associated PTKs, such as Lyn, is critical to modulation of BCR signaling pathways, these co-receptors can be considered to act like adaptor proteins. Coligation of co-receptors and BCR brings Lyn into the close proximity with the cytoplasmic domains of co-receptors, thereby leading to their phosphorylation. Thus, information about the nature of each antigen as well as the microenvironment is recognized by co-receptors, is translated into the strength of phosphorylation and phosphorylation site(s) in the cytoplasmic domains of these co-receptors. For instance, tyrosine residues within the ITIM of the cytoplasmic domain of FcγRII is phosphorylated by coligation of FcγRII and BCR through antigen-antibody complexes, leading to recruitment of SHIP by phosphotyrosine-SH2 interaction (164). Recruitment of SHIP to the phosphorylated ITIM in FcγRII brings this enzyme into close proximity to its substrate, PI3,4,5-P₃, inducing its breakdown (165, 166). As discussed above, since this lipid product, generated by PI-3K activation, is thought to increase calcium influx, the breakdown of PI3,4,5-P₃ by SHIP results in a decrease in calcium influx. Because SHIP inhibits the BCR signal alone (181), SHIP conveys signals from the BCR as well as from FcγRII. Thus, SHIP is required for inhibiting calcium mobilization, and the FcγRII cytoplasmic domain acts to amplify this inhibition.

In contrast to a requirement for SHIP in FcγRII-mediated inhibitory signal, protein tyrosine phosphatases SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 participate in CD22- (167) and PIR-B-mediated inhibition (168, 169). SHP-1 and/or SHP-2 are recruited to the phosphorylated ITIMs in CD22 and PIR-B, whereupon they become activated, resulting in the inhibition of tyrosine phosphorylation of PLC-γ2 by dephosphorylating Syk and Btk (182).

# DIFFERENTIAL SIGNALING BY THE BCR

Signaling from the BCR provokes several different cellular responses, depending on the stage of differentiation of the B cell and on extracellular inputs. The best examples that opposite responses to antigen occur at different B cell stages are immature versus mature B cells. Cross-linking BCR on immature B cells aborts B cell development in vivo and transmits a signal that preferentially inactivates immature B cells in vitro, whereas stimulation of mature B cells

with anti-IgM antibodies triggers a mitogenic response. What is the underlying mechanism leading to distinct biological responses? Although BCR-induced calcium mobilization was comparable in mature versus immature B cells, induction of the Ras/ERK responsive *egr-1* and *c-fos* genes was only detectable in mature B cells (170). Failure to activate *egr-1* in immature B cells may reflect developmentally regulated methylation of this gene (171). Thus, one possibility is that developmental changes in transcription factor expression, chromatin structure, or covalent modification of genes could allow the same BCR-induced cytosolic signals to regulate different sets of genes in immature versus mature B cells.

Arrested development of immature B cells followed by deletion or receptor editing (secondary light chain gene rearrangements) is triggered by a variety of high avidity self-antigens such as membrane bound H-2K<sup>b</sup> (172), membrane bound HEL (173), erythrocyte surface antigens (174), and double-stranded DNA (175). It had been previously thought that a single cell type (IgM<sup>+</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>) is capable of either antigen-induced receptor editing or apoptosis depending on the nature of the antigen. However, Nemazee and co-workers proposed an alternative model: that antigen-induced apoptosis arises relatively late in the immature B cell stage (IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> corresponding to transitional stage) and is preceded by a functionally distinct developmental stage capable of receptor editing (IgM<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup>) (Figure 1). Indeed, upon BCR ligation, IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> cells were more sensitive to apoptosis, and conversely IgM<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> B cells were more competent to undergo upregulation of Rag2 mRNA than IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> cells. Moreover, both apoptosis and upregulation of Rag2 were induced by treatment with ionomycin on IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> and IgM<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>-</sup> B cells, respectively, demonstrating that calcium mobilization is likely responsible for both receptor editing and apoptosis, depending on the developmental stage (176). Identification of downstream targets of calcium mobilization that could explain these distinct responses certainly deserves future study.

Transgenic mice expressing a well-defined HEL-specific receptor on most B cells (*Ig<sup>HEL</sup>* transgenic mice) in combination with mice expressing HEL as a self-antigen (HEL-transgenic mice) provide a well-controlled model to analyze positive versus negative signaling at the same maturation stage of B cells. In *Ig<sup>HEL</sup>* transgenic mice, the transgenic BCR has not been exposed to HEL in the bone marrow. Acute ligation of the BCR on these naive cells with foreign HEL rapidly induces a large biphasic calcium response. NF-AT and NF-κB are translocated to the nucleus, the *c-myc* gene is induced within 30 min, and JNK and ERK are activated. By contrast to single *Ig<sup>HEL</sup>* transgenic mice, in HEL/*Ig<sup>HEL</sup>* double-transgenic mice, which express soluble HEL as a circulating self-antigen, the concentration and avidity of antigen and the maturation stage of the cells are the same, but the timing of B cell encounter

with HEL and costimulation are different. In these double-transgenic mice, binding of soluble HEL begins as soon as BCRs are expressed on immature B cells in the bone marrow. During the initial encounter in the bone marrow and during chronic exposure in the periphery, no positive responses occur in the double-transgenic mice. These tolerant B cells exhibit chronic calcium oscillations, continuous shuttling of NF-AT to the nucleus and activation of ERK, whereas neither NFκB nor JNK is activated, nor is c-myc, B7.2, or CD69 induced (177). Thus, the negative response to chronic self-antigen triggers only a subset of the signals that are active in the acute positive response made by naive B cells. These distinct signals are likely to reflect differential defects in the activity of proximal signaling molecules in tolerant B cells. HEL-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Syk in tolerant cells is dramatically inhibited compared with that in naive cells. HEL also induces very little increase in tyrosine phosphorylation of Igα and Igβ in tolerant cells. In contrast to downregulation of Syk in tolerant cells, the Src-family PTKs appear to be still active in tolerant cells (178). Thus, one potential explanation is that expression of Syk kinase inhibitors might be induced during chronic exposure to HEL.

Apart from activation signals through the BCR, what is the molecular basis for the persistent signal by the BCR? Although little information is currently available regarding molecules involved in this persistent signal, some hints might be gleaned from experiments using pervanadate/H₂O₂ to stimulate J558L myeloma cell lines. Treatment of cells with this chemical inhibits PTPases, activates PTKs, and increases phosphorylation of substrates. Most PTK substrates are phosphorylated only in BCR-positive transfectants of J558L, but not in the BCR-negative parental cells (179). These data suggest that, once BCR is expressed on the cell surface, the BCR organizes PTKs and substrate proteins. Thus, assuming that components such as scaffold proteins are required for this organization of PTKs and their substrates, this scaffold protein molecule might be involved in generating the persistent signal.

# FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Just over a decade has passed since the first description of the ITAM within the Igα/Igβ subunits of the BCR. Remarkable progress has occurred in enumerating the signal transduction elements that link the BCR to the cell interior. However, as the signaling components become more and more detailed, we are in danger of losing an overview of the organization scheme that determines the function of different signaling pathways. Proper dissection of the signal transduction circuitry controlling B cell responsiveness will require the development of novel analytical techniques to measure biochemical changes in single cells.

Deletion or activation of genes under regulated conditions, as well as the use of fluorescent proteins whose location and expression can be followed inside living cells, will be critical for these efforts. Deciphering the regulatory pathways that select anergy, apoptosis, editing, or activation from a menu of alternative signaling pathways will provide a means to develop novel immunomodulatory drugs.
