ABSTRACT

Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) regulates inflammation, aging (life span and health span), calorie restriction/energetics, mitochondrial biogenesis, stress resistance, cellular senescence, endothelial functions, apoptosis/autophagy, and circadian rhythms through deacetylation of transcription factors and histones. SIRT1 level and activity are decreased in chronic inflammatory conditions and aging, in which oxidative stress occurs. SIRT1 is regulated by a NAD⁺-dependent DNA repair enzyme, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1), and subsequent NAD⁺ depletion by oxidative stress may have consequent effects on inflammatory and stress responses as well as cellular senescence. SIRT1 has been shown to undergo covalent oxidative modifications by cigarette smoke-derived oxidants/aldehydes, leading to posttranslational modifications, inactivation, and protein degradation. Furthermore, oxidant/carbonyl stress-mediated reduction of SIRT1 leads to the loss of its control of acetylation of target proteins including p53, RelA/p65, and FOXO3, thereby enhancing the inflammatory, prosenescent, and apoptotic responses, as well as endothelial dysfunction. In this review, the mechanisms of cigarette smoke/oxidant-mediated redox posttranslational modifications of SIRT1 and its roles in PARP1 and NF-kB activation, and FOXO3 and eNOS regulation, as well as chromatin remodeling/histone modifications during inflamming, are discussed. Furthermore, we also discuss various novel ways to activate SIRT1 either directly or indirectly, which may have therapeutic potential in attenuating inflammation and premature senescence involved in chronic lung diseases.

Oxidative stress and posttranslational modifications of SIRT1

Mammalian SIRT1 comprises 747 amino acids and consists of three regions: the central core, possessing the deacetylase domain (amino acids 273–517), and the N- and C-terminal regions flanking the enzymatic core [14] (Fig. 1). The catalytic domain comprises 250 amino acids and is highly conserved among species. The catalytic domain is composed of a substrate binding pocket and a NAD⁺ binding pocket, consisting of a structural Zn²⁺ complexed to 4 cysteine residues, a Rossmann fold domain, a classical NAD-binding motif, and other serine residues [14]. The N- and C-termini contain regulatory elements and binding domains for SIRT1 coactivators/corepressors and substrates.

To date, SIRT1 has been shown to contain 15 phosphorylation sites [36–39], one SUMOylation residue [40], and two S-nitrosylation residues [41]. The putative sites of the other posttranslational modifications, such as carbonylation and S-glutathionylation, remain to be characterized [31,42]. Oxidative stress-mediated posttranslational modifications of SIRT1 may be due to the adaptive response to environmental stress under acute conditions. However, under a chronic oxidative/environmental stress, these modifications can be deleterious. The effects of posttranslational modifications on SIRT1 are summarized in Fig. 2.

SIRT1 undergoes serine phosphorylation, and the phosphorylation/dephosphorylation affects its activity and protein levels through proteasome-dependent or -independent degradation [28,31,36,43]. SIRT1 contains several posttranslational modification sites for phosphorylation, of which seven are localized within the N-terminus and eight within the C-terminus. Serine phosphorylation sites on SIRT1 (Ser27, Ser47, Ser659, and Ser661) are identified, and these are regulated by various protein kinases under basal physiological conditions [36–38,43,44]. Phosphorylation of SIRT1 on Ser27 by JNK2 kinase increases the stability of SIRT1 in cancer cell lines [45]. Similarly, mIGF-1/JNK1 regulation of SIRT1 protects against oxidative stress in the heart [46]. The separate studies have demonstrated that JNK1-dependent SIRT1 phosphorylation promotes its enzymatic activity, but leads to proteasome-mediated degradation [44,47], suggesting the dual effects of JNK1-dependent phosphorylation on SIRT1. Phosphorylation on Thr530 and Ser540 by cyclinB/Cdk1 is required for normal cell cycle progression [36]. SIRT1 is phosphorylated on Ser154, Ser649, Ser651, and Ser683 by casein kinase 2 (CK2) in response to ionizing radiation-induced DNA damage, which increases SIRT1 deacetylase activity and substrate binding affinity [43]. We have shown that oxidants/aldehydes derived from cigarette smoke caused SIRT1 phosphorylation in macrophages and epithelial cells, as well as in mouse lungs [31]. Proteasome inhibitors block cigarette smoke-induced reduction of SIRT1, suggesting that phosphorylation, in addition to covalent oxidative/nitrosative modifications, of SIRT1 leads to its irreversible modification and subsequent proteasomal degradation [27,31].

SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like protein that has the opposite effect of ubiquitin. Ubiquitination has classically been shown to increase protein degradation, whereas SUMOylation has been shown to increase protein stability [48]. Both SUMOylation and ubiquitination can occur under oxidative stress conditions, and these effects are regulated by the intracellular thiol levels. SUMOylation of SIRT1 has also been reported [40]. When SIRT1 is SUMOylated at Lys734, its deacetylase activity is increased. In response to oxidative stress and DNA damage induced by UV radiation, SIRT1 associates with sentrin-specific protease 1 (SENP1) and becomes deSUMOylated and less active [40].

Oxidants/electrophiles covalently modify SIRT1 posttranslationally, decreasing its enzymatic activity and marking the protein for proteasomal degradation [31]. SIRT1 is a redox-sensitive molecule, and intracellular thiols regulate SIRT1 level and activity. Treatment with buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) biosynthesis, further decreased SIRT1 levels in response to oxidative/carbonyl stress, whereas elevation of intracellular thiol pools by GSH monoethyl ester rescued cigarette smoke extract-induced reduction of SIRT1 abundance in epithelial cells. Further study is required to investigate whether treatments with buthionine sulfoximine and GSH monoethyl ester influence SIRT1 glutathionylation. Zee et al. [42] have shown that SIRT1 is also subject to S-glutathionylation of specific cysteine residues (e.g., Cys67, Cys268, and Cys623), leading to inhibition of resveratrol-induced SIRT1 activation. It remains elusive how SIRT1 glutathionylation differentially affects its enzymatic activity and abundance. Aldehydes caused formation of carbonyl adducts on SIRT1 cysteine residues, which was reversed by increasing the intracellular thiols and N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC) [31]. SIRT1 was also carbonylated and glutathionylated in vivo in mice exposed to cigarette smoke. These modifications were attenuated by increasing intracellular thiols by NAC in vitro and in vivo in mice overexpressing glutaredoxin 1, an enzyme that repairs glutathionylated proteins.

S-nitrosylation is a covalent attachment of a nitric oxide group to a cysteine thiol/sulfhydryl, which leads to formation of an S-nitrosothiol derivative [49]. Kornberg et al. [41] showed that nitrosylated glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was transported to the nucleus and physiologically transnitrosylated SIRT1 and HDAC2. Because nitric oxide is a major mediator in inflammation, the S-nitrosylation of SIRT1 by GAPDH via nitric oxide synthase (NOS) may have clinical relevance in chronic inflammation and type 2 diabetes. Though this study showed that SIRT1 is nitrosylated at cysteine 387 and 390 residues by residue-specific mutation and the biotin switch assay, further confirmation by proteomics is required to affirm these S-nitrosylation sites.

A recent study highlighted that a 25-amino-acid sequence in the C-terminal domain is essential for SIRT1 deacetylase activity [50]. The endogenous SIRT1 inhibitor deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1) inhibits SIRT1 by inhibiting this domain. This is mediated by protein kinase A and AMP-activated protein kinase [51]. Similarly, SIRT1 activity was shown to be negatively regulated by DBC1 through direct binding, and

Fig. 2. Posttranslational modifications of SIRT1. In response to oxidative stress, SIRT1 undergoes posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation (P), S-nitrosylation (SNO), S-glutathionylation (GSH), carbonylation (CO), and SUMOylation (SUMO). SIRT1 deacetylase activity and subsequent cellular responses are affected by these posttranslational modifications. Alterations in the intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio by oxidative stress can also affect these modifications.

this SIRT1-DBC1 interaction was increased after DNA damage and oxidative stress [52]. These data suggest a multiple mode of biochemical regulation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity.

Taken together, these studies suggest that SIRT1 is a redox-
sensitive protein, subject to posttranslational modifications, such
as phosphorylation, SUMOylation, S-nitrosylation, S-glutathiony-
lation, and carbonylation, leading to alteration of SIRT1 level and
activity [27,28,31]. Oxidant/carbonyl stress-induced reduction of
SIRT1 through posttranslational modifications may have implica-
tions in the pathogenesis of chronic inflammatory diseases in
which oxidative stress occurs.

Biology of SIRT1 in response to oxidative stress

Deacetylase function of SIRT1

Acetylation is a common posttranslational modification, and
many biological functions ranging from altering protein function
to opening DNA for transcription are regulated by this modifica-
tion. Acetylation occurs on the N-terminus of proteins or on the ε-
amino group of lysines by histone acetyltransferases, such as p300,
CREB-binding protein (CBP), and p300/CBP-associated factor. Acet-
ylation is a reversible modification, as acetyl groups are removed
from proteins by deacetylases, such as HDACs. SIRT1 reverses
acetylation of lysine residues on their target proteins by hydro-
lyzing one NAD⁺ and generating nicotinamide and a unique
metabolite called 2'-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. Nicotinamide is an inhi-
bitor of SIRT1 and a precursor for NAD⁺ synthesis through the
NAD⁺ salvage pathway. Because this mechanism utilizes a NAD⁺-
dependent reaction, deacetylation by SIRT1 may be affected by the
NAD⁺/NADH ratio toward higher NAD⁺ levels, thereby increasing
SIRT1 deacetylase activity [15,53]. Canto et al. [54] supported this
concept showing that AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)

nonhistone proteins, which are summarized in Table 1.
In terms of redox response, evidence has indicated that
oxidative stress plays a significant role in the regulation of SIRT1
deacetylase activity [55]. Earlier studies indicated that SIRT1
promotes cell survival under oxidative stress by inhibiting p53-
dependent apoptosis, via inhibition of p53 transactivation through
its deacetylation [56]. Since then, Brunet et al. [57] have shown
that SIRT1 and FOXO3 bind together in response to oxidative
stress, and SIRT1 deacetylates FOXO3, which also occurs with
FOXO4 in response to peroxide stress [58]. Cigarette smoke-
induced oxidative stress augments acetylation of FOXO3 in lungs
of both mice and human smokers, which is attenuated by SIRT1
overexpression and pharmacological activator [13,59]. Similarly,
both SIRT1 overexpression and a specific pharmacological activa-
tor (SRT1720) decrease acetylation of RelA/p65 and NF-κB-
dependent inflammation in mouse lungs by oxidative stress
imposed by cigarette smoke [13,29,30]. Hence, both reduced SIRT1

abundance and reduced activity under oxidative stress conditions can lead to increased acetylation of NF-κB and FOXO3. Though numerous studies regarding the tight relations between oxidative stress and the NAD⁺ salvage pathway have been reported, the plausible mechanism in which oxidative stress regulates SIRT1 is not well characterized. Recently, however, several compelling studies regarding the regulation of circadian rhythm have provided a hint for this mechanism. NAMPT-mediated NAD⁺ biosynthesis and intracellular NAD⁺ levels display circadian oscillations that are regulated by a negative feedback loop involving NAMPT/NAD⁺ and CLOCK/SIRT1 [60,61]. SIRT1 regulates the circadian clock oscillatory mechanisms via deacetylation of circadian clock components [62,63]. Various organisms are subjected to endogenous circadian and exogenously driven daily rhythms. Substantial oscillation of antioxidant enzyme activity has been detected [64], suggesting the significance of circadian rhythmicity in avoiding excessive oxidative stress. Furthermore, it is reported that disruption of circadian rhythms by jet lag and working a night shift predisposes to inflammation [65]. Taken together, physiological and chronobiological relevance of SIRT1 activity in response to oxidative stress may provide new research directions regarding inflammation and its therapeutic strategies based on SIRT1 activation.

### Transcriptional regulation of SIRT1

Oxidative stress-mediated posttranslational modifications of SIRT1 can affect its stability and enzymatic activity, but little is known about the regulation of SIRT1 gene expression at the transcriptional level. Transcription of SIRT1 is controlled by the p53 and FOXO3 transcription factors. When p53 is activated, p53 is phosphorylated and then acetylated by CBP/p300 acetyltransferases on Lys370, Lys372, Lys373, Lys381, and Lys382 residues, which exposes its DNA binding domain [66]. Activated p53 has been shown to bind to two p53-response elements on the SIRT1 promoter [67]. Under conditions of nutrient withdrawal and short-term starvation, activated FOXO3 is translocated into the nucleus of pheochromocytoma neuronal cancer cells, in which it binds and removes p53 from two p53-binding sites on the SIRT1 promoter [67]. As p53 represses SIRT1 gene expression, its removal by FOXO3 activates SIRT1 transcription. The repression of SIRT1 transcription by p53 may be attenuated by activation of endothelial NOS (eNOS) in endothelial cells. The eNOS produces NO•, which activates guanylate cyclase to produce cGMP from GTP, thereby decreasing p53 stability [68]. SIRT1 is also able to deacetylate and activate eNOS [69]. Additionally, SIRT1 is capable

of directly deacetylating p53 (p53 binds to the promoter region of SIRT1), which destabilizes and inactivates the transcription factor [56], providing another twist to the mechanism by which SIRT1 can regulate its own transcription (Fig. 3). However, during DNA damage by etoposide, the regulation of SIRT1 is not controlled by p53 [70]. Furthermore, SIRT1 activity and transcription are increased during acute hypoxia in a HIF-dependent manner [71]. SIRT1 deacetylates both HIF-1α on Lys674 and HIF-2α on Lys385, Lys685, and Lys741, changing their activities in opposing directions. Deacetylation by SIRT1 suppresses HIF-1α transactivation, whereas HIF-2α-mediated transcription of target genes is activated [16,72]. Hence, a SIRT1–HIF-2α/SIRT1–HIF-1α feedback loop, which is active during hypoxia [73,74], may affect SIRT1 stability on the transcriptional level and have implications in other environmental stress-related chronic inflammatory diseases.

Under conditions of oxidative stress, two other transcription factors, tumor suppressor hypermethylated in cancer 1 (HIC1) and the cell cycle regulator E2F1, have been identified to modulate SIRT1 transcription (Fig. 3). The HIC1 transcriptional repressor has been shown to inhibit SIRT1 transcription in response to the DNA damage response, leading to downregulation of prosurvival activities of p53 [70]. Despite its inactivating function under oxidative stress, HIC1 is also able to induce SIRT1 transcription upon calorie restriction. Conversely, SIRT1 transcription and its protein levels have also been shown to increase through activation of the E2F1 transcription factor in response to DNA damage [75]. Elevated SIRT1 deacetylates E2F1 and shuts down its own transcription as a feedback inhibitory mechanism, which may inhibit the proapoptotic activities of E2F1 [75]. Thus, SIRT1 plays a major role in its own gene transcription. However, the cells may not be able to replenish SIRT1 levels if a significant amount of SIRT1 is lost. In posttranscriptional SIRT1 regulation, the Hu antigen R (HuR), which is a member of the embryonic lethal abnormal-vision family of mRNA-binding proteins, plays a critical role in the stability of SIRT1 mRNA. HuR binds with the SIRT1 mRNA and maintains its steady-state levels. Abdelmohsen et al. [76] reported that the HuR–SIRT1 mRNA complex is rapidly dissociated in response to oxidative stress, leading to the destabilization of SIRT1 mRNA and reduction of SIRT1 protein levels (Fig. 4).

#### SIRT1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling

SIRT1 is a nuclear protein and was first described in HeLa cells and human fibroblasts [77,78]. However, its presence in the nucleus has been doubted because of several other experimental observations in different cell lines and organisms studied.

Fig. 3. Transcriptional regulation of SIRT1 in response to oxidative stress. Transcription of SIRT1 is repressed by activation of p53, HIC1, and E2F1 in response to oxidative stress. FOXO3 removes p53 from two p53-binding sites on the SIRT1 promoter. Repression of SIRT1 transcription by p53 may reduce the activation of endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) through eNOS acetylation. SIRT1 also deacetylates p53 and FOXO3 and in turn modulates their transcriptional activity.

Fig. 5. Regulation of SIRT1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling by oxidative stress. Oxidative stress causes oxidative and carbonyl modifications as well as nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1 to the cytoplasm. This will decrease SIRT1 protein levels through proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm. At the same time, the transcription of NF-κB-dependent proinflammatory genes is increased once SIRT1 is reduced. Intracellular redox status (i.e., GSH/GSSG ratio) can also affect nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1. NES, nuclear export sequences.

For example, in *Drosophila*, the SIRT1 homologue Sir2 was initially localized to the cytoplasm, but it shuttles to the nucleus during the blastoderm of embryonic development [79]. In mammalian cells, SIRT1 is present in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm (nucleo-cytoplasm) in neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, mouse striatum, ependymal cells of the testes in mouse, and human pancreatic β cells [80, 81]. Furthermore, two independent studies have confirmed that murine SIRT1 is indeed subjected to nucleocytoplasmic shuttling upon oxidative stress [81, 82].

Mammalian (mouse) SIRT1 possesses two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs; amino acid residues 31–38 and 223–230) and two nuclear export sequences (NESs; amino acid residues 138–145, 425–431) [81]. The two NLSs are N-terminal to the central catalytic domain, whereas one NES is N-terminal to the catalytic domain and the second resides in the catalytic domain. Hence, the catalytic domain is the key in recognizing the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1. In humans, SIRT1 has both NLSs and NESs, but their exact residues are not fully characterized [82]. Both of these sequences can be the targets of oxidative stress. It has been reported that oxidative stress regulates the NLS and NES of many proteins, such as yeast transcription factor Pap1, and yAP-1, as well as the human pancreatic transcription factor PDX-1 [83–85]. It remains unknown whether the imbalance of the GSH/GSSG ratio in the nucleus also has a profound effect on the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1.

The nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1 has been described in both physiological and pathological conditions in which oxidative stress occurs (Fig. 5). Inhibition of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) with LY 294002 resulted in cytoplasmic localization of SIRT1, although the amino acid residue phosphorylated by this kinase is not known [81]. It has been shown that in *Caenorhabditis elegans* the homologue of SIRT1, Sir-2.1, binds to the 14-3-3 protein, which is a phosphoserine-binding protein that can enhance nucleocytoplasmic shuttling [86–88]. However, it remains to be determined whether human SIRT1 can also bind to 14-3-3 protein. In contrast, SIRT1 has been shown to shuttle from the cytoplasm to the nucleus during the differentiation of neural progenitor cells to neurons [89]. SIRT1 has been shown to be localized in the nucleus, resulting in increased histone deacetylation and apoptosis in response to oxidative stress [81, 82, 90]. This suggests that SIRT1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling and localization determine its function under oxidative stress. The activity of SIRT1 deacetylase can be present in the cytoplasm owing to the presence of many known SIRT1 substrates, including p53, FOXO proteins, and NF-κB. These molecules can also shuttle between both compartments. Recently a few cytoplasmic targets of SIRT1 deacetylation have been identified; these include Atg proteins (Atg5, 7, and 8) involved in autophagy, the process of degrading cellular organelles and proteins [91]. Other cytoplasmic targets of SIRT1 remain to be identified. These targets may also be under the regulation of the redox status of the cells.

Fig. 6. SIRT1 in regulating inflammation and cellular senescence under oxidative stress. Oxidants derived from cigarette smoke inhibit SIRT1 activity and reduce its levels by posttranslational modifications. SIRT1 reduction leads to RelA/p65 and FOXO3 acetylation, as well as modification of histones H3 and H4. The acetylation of these molecules by SIRT1 reduction causes the abnormal transcription of proinflammatory, antioxidant, prosenescent, and proapoptotic genes involved in oxidative stress, inflammation, and premature cellular senescence.

Cigarette smoke extract induced a time- and dose-dependent shuttling of SIRT1 from the nucleus in human bronchial epithelial cells and other cell types [31]. H₂O₂ treatment also resulted in the cytoplasmic localization of SIRT1 [31,82]. Because cigarette smoke extract induces the loss of SIRT1, it is possible that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1 may facilitate proteasomal degradation in the cytoplasm, although H₂O₂ does not lead to SIRT1 protein loss [31,82]. Recent studies have highlighted that cytoplasmic localization of SIRT1 occurs during apoptosis [82]; however, no cell death was seen in response to cigarette smoke extract and H₂O₂ treatments in lung epithelial cells [31]. This suggests that carbonyl stress rather than oxidative stress causes degradation of SIRT1, though both stresses cause the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1.

Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1 in response to oxidative stress could be reduced by pretreatment of cells with NAC (increasing the intracellular thiol pools) [31], suggesting that nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is mediated by a redox-sensitive mechanism. This observation suggested that the redox status of the cells also affects NES/NLS and other proteins involved in nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1. Oxidative stress activates redox-sensitive kinases, such as IkB kinase, PI3K, and extracellular signal-related kinase 1/2 [92,93]. PI3K has been shown to be involved in the nuclear localization of SIRT1, because inhibition of PI3K resulted in cytoplasmic localization of SIRT1 [81]. The phosphorylation by CK2 increases SIRT1 activity [37,43], suggesting that a kinase-dependent redox mechanism is involved in SIRT1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Cellular signaling, particularly the kinase-dependent phosphorylation, is a key determinant of cellular localization for several proteins, which include FOXO3 transcription factor [94,95]. Cigarette smoke/oxidative stress-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of SIRT1 can affect the SIRT1-FOXO3 pathway, resulting in a loss of certain antioxidant defense mechanisms as FOXO3 regulates MnSOD and catalase (Fig. 6).

SIRT1 signaling in the regulation of inflammation and cellular senescence

In the ensuing sections, the signaling pathway in which SIRT1 is involved in the regulation of inflammation and cellular senescence via several signaling molecules is discussed.

SIRT1 and RelA/p65

NF-κB is a key redox-sensitive transcription factor responsible for proinflammatory gene transcription [96]. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukin-8 (IL-8), and IL-6, play an important role in activating cells of the immune system and thus aid in the initiation of the inflammatory response. One of the major sources of these proinflammatory mediators is the macrophages at the site of injury. In these cells, the regulation of transcription of these cytokines is mediated by NF-κB. Under physiological and pathological conditions, NF-κB must undergo a variety of posttranslational modifications, including phosphorylation and acetylation [97]. Acetylation (along with phosphorylation) plays a prominent role in regulating the nuclear action of NF-κB. It has been reported that both p300 and CBP acetyltransferases acetylate the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB at Lys218, Lys221, and Lys310 [98]. Acetylation of discrete lysine residues in RelA/p65 modulates distinct functions of NF-κB, including transcriptional activation, DNA binding, and assembly with its inhibitor IκBα [99]. Upon acetylation by the master coactivator CBP/p300, the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB is unable to

bind to IkBα and thus remains bound to DNA and able to stimulate gene expression. Deacetylation allows NF-κB/IkBα interaction and suppression of NF-κB activity. The amplitude and duration of the cycles of NF-κB/IkB association and dissociation seem to be critical for the induction of proinflammatory genes, particularly in response to oxidative stress.

SIRT1 can interact with RelA/p65 protein in the NF-κB complex and specifically deacetylates lysine 310 and potentiates the trans-activation capacity of the NF-κB complex [100]. A similar function is seen in response to other stresses including cigarette smoke. Cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress induces reduction of SIRT1 associated with increased acetylation and activation of RelA/p65 NF-κB [13,29]. Depletion of SIRT1 by siRNA leads to augmentation of cigarette smoke-mediated acetylation of RelA/p65 NF-κB [29]. Oxidant/cigarette smoke-mediated proinflammatory cytokine release is regulated by SIRT1 via its interaction with NF-κB in a monocyte-macrophage cell line (MonoMac6), in mouse lung tissue, and in smokers and patients with COPD [13,29,30]. Cigarette smoke extract caused a dose- and time-dependent decrease in SIRT1 levels and activity concomitant with increased NF-κB-dependent release of proinflammatory mediators in MonoMac6 cells and in mouse lungs [29,30]. Sirtinol (an inhibitor of SIRT1) augmented, whereas SRT1720 (a specific and potent SIRT1 activator) inhibited, cigarette smoke-mediated proinflammatory cytokine release [13,29]. Furthermore, SIRT1 interacts with the RelA/p65 subunit of NF-κB, and this interaction is disrupted by cigarette smoke, leading to increased acetylation of RelA/p65 in MonoMac6 cells [29]. A recent study has demonstrated the functional regulation of SIRT1 through NF-κB-dependent STAT3 expression in mitochondria [101]. Genetic ablation of SIRT1 contributes to heightened cellular respiration through the induction and activation of STAT3, via phosphorylation (Ser727) and subcellular localization of STAT3, in mitochondria, implicating the interplay between STAT3 and SIRT1 in proinflammatory conditions [101]. In addition to regulating the proinflammatory response, NF-κB also regulates prosurvival pathways mainly in transformed cells [102,103]. However, it remains to discover what forms of RelA/p65 (phosphorylated and/or acetylated) impart these effects in nontransformed versus transformed cells, whether one or both of these aspects are regulated by oxidants/redox status of the cells. Yao and co-workers [13] have recently shown that genetic ablation of SIRT1 in mice leads to increased NF-κB activation and proinflammatory cytokine release in response to cigarette smoke, implying a key role for SIRT1 in the regulation of NF-κB-regulated genes. SIRT1 has also been shown to play an important role in IL-2-mediated reversal of T cell tolerance [104]. Hence, downregulation of SIRT1 would have dual effects leading to increased lung inflammation and decreased cytoprotective effects of lung cells. This may be a vicious cycle leading to increased oxidative stress.

SIRT1 and FOXOs

FOXO transcription factor, which contains forkhead DNA-binding domains, is the mammalian homologue of the C.elegans longevity gene Daf-16. FOXOs are involved in mediating the response to oxidative stress, and enhanced oxidative stress resistance has been frequently correlated with increased lifespan [105]. Furthermore, FOXO3 protects quiescent cells from oxidative stress by directly increasing MnSOD mRNA transcription and protein levels [22]. Oxidative stress can also regulate FOXOs through the small GTPase/JNK-dependent mechanism [106]. In addition to oxidative stress, accumulating studies suggest that FOXOs participate in the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory diseases. FOXO3 deficiency leads to spontaneous lymphocyte proliferation associated with inflammation due to the loss of

NF-κB inhibition [107]. FOXO1 deficiency induces inflammatory bowel disease [108], which is also shown in FOXO4-deficient mice [109]. However, in neutrophilic inflammation, such as rheumatoid arthritis and peritonitis, FOXO3 levels are elevated and required to suppress proapoptotic responses in neutrophils [110,111]. Such observations indicate that FOXOs play a critical role in the pathogenesis of inflammation, but the mechanism underlying both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects of FOXOs remains elusive.

Transcriptional activity of FOXOs is generally regulated by their posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation. Several studies have shown that FOXO1, FOXO3, and FOXO4 are acetylated in response to cellular stress by the acetyltransferase of CBP/p300, and FOXOs physically associate with SIRT1 [57,58,112]. These studies noted that FOXOs were deacetylated and their transcriptional activity was repressed by SIRT1 [112]. Interestingly, SIRT1 can also stimulate FOXO activity. For example, this is the case for FOXO1, after deacetylation of Lys242, Lys245, and Lys262 [113], or for a subset of FOXO3 and FOXO4 genes controlling resistance to oxidative stress [57,58]. Recent studies have shown that cigarette smoke and oxidative stress induce a significant reduction in protein abundance of SIRT1 and FOXO3, leading to excessive and persistent inflammation and emphysema/COPD by increased acetylation of FOXO3 [59]. Cigarette smoke-induced acetylation of FOXO3 due to the loss of SIRT1 enhances the transcription of antioxidant genes to counteract oxidative stress. In other inflammatory diseases, such as myocardial infarction, tyrosol activates FOXO3 and SIRT1, resulting in cardioprotection [114]. The NAD-NAMPT pathway has been shown to be involved in the FOXO3-mediated regulation of the growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 45A [115], implicating the role of this pathway in cigarette smoke-induced cellular senescence. A recent study has shown the role of the SIRT1-FOXO3 axis in cellular adaptation to hypoxia-associated oxidative stress. Kume et al. [116] have shown that hypoxia inhibited SIRT1 activity and failed to enhance nuclear translocation of FOXO3, subsequent autophagy, and cell cycle arrest, which increased mitochondrial oxidative damage in kidneys of aged mice. It has recently been shown that SIRT1 is also required for AMPK activation and the beneficial effects of resveratrol on mitochondrial function [117]. Studies have shown that FOXO3 plays an important role in endothelial function as well [118,119]. Despite the knowledge of SIRT1-mediated regulation of FOXOs, the roles of SIRT1 and FOXOs on cellular metabolism and disease pathogenesis are still controversial. There seem to be contradictory effects of deacetylation on FOXO function that cannot easily be reconciled. Further studies are required to understand the role of oxidative stress or redox status of the cells in the regulation of SIRT1-FOXOs in various inflammatory conditions and also in cell differentiation, senescence, and metabolism.

SIRT1 and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP1)

PARP1 is the key member of the PARP family and is known as a DNA-bound enzyme that protects the genome stability by repairing DNA and regulates chromatin structure, transcription, cell proliferation, and apoptosis. Several studies have shown that PARP1 is rapidly activated in diverse inflammatory conditions and in response to oxidant and genotoxic stress. PARP1 suppression by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibitors reduces the extent of inflammatory responses. The role of PARP1 in inflammation is demonstrated by the observations that PARP1 facilitates the inflammatory responses by promoting gene expression of inflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2, IL-1β, IL-6, TNF-α, and monocyte chemotactic protein-1, although PARP1 has an anti-inflammatory effect [120,121].

Oxidative or genotoxic stress and abnormal redox status activate PARP1, leading to the depletion of NAD⁺ and subsequent inactivation of SIRT1 deacetylase activity. PARP1 activation is also regulated by intracellular levels of GSH/GSSG. Furthermore, SIRT1 regulates PARP1 activity by deacetylating PARP1 in response to oxidative stress. NMN, nicotinamide mononucleotide; NAMPT, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase; NMNAT, nicotinamide/nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase; PARP1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1.

PARP1 is involved in the regulation of poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation using NAD⁺ as a donor of ADP-ribose units. Poly(ADP-ribose) is negatively charged and noncovalently binds to nuclear proteins, such as histones and other transcription factors. Because of this function, poly(ADP-ribose) can act as a scaffolding to allow for chromatin remodeling and DNA repair processes. In response to oxidative and genotoxic stresses, PARP1 is activated, converting NAD⁺ into poly(ADP-ribose) chains, which noncovalently modify nuclear proteins (Fig. 7). Because PARP1 and SIRT1 both require NAD⁺ as a substrate, it is expected that PARP1 could have profound effects on SIRT1 activity. This is true because PARP1 and SIRT1 interact and are involved in apoptosis-inducing factor 1-mediated apoptosis [122]. The inhibition of SIRT1 by PARP1 activation and subsequent NAD⁺ depletion has been shown in response to H₂O₂-induced cell senescence [32], but the effect of oxidative/genotoxic stimuli on PARP1 activation and SIRT1 activity still remains to be studied. Cigarette smoke induces PARP1 and reduces the levels of SIRT1 perhaps owing to depletion of the intracellular NAD⁺ pool. A methylxanthine derivative (a component of tea polyphenols), theophylline, an anti-inflammatory agent, protects against intracellular NAD⁺ depletion via PARP1 inhibition and associated sparing of SIRT1 activity in macrophages and lung cells of patients with COPD [123–125]. Furthermore, PARP1 was activated in response to cigarette smoke and oxidative stress, as evidenced by increased formation of poly(ADP-ribose), which is due to depletion of NAD⁺ and subsequent reduction of SIRT1 activity (Fig. 7) [126]. Interestingly, a PARP1 pharmacological inhibitor, 3-aminobenzimidazole, attenuated cigarette smoke-and oxidative stress-induced autophagy. This phenomenon occurs through a partial increase in SIRT1 activity, implicating the role of PARP1 in pulmonary inflammation and senescence [126]. Interestingly, inhibition of PARP1 did not fully restore cigarette smoke-induced decrease in SIRT1 activity in lung epithelial cells even in the presence of the SIRT1 activator resveratrol. This may be due to SIRT1 posttranslational modifications, such as carbonylation/alkylation, thereby impairing (because of covalent modifications) the restoration of SIRT1 activity even when the level of NAD⁺ is elevated after PARP1 inhibition [27]. These studies show that a functional link exists between PARP1 and SIRT1 through NAD⁺ cofactor availability in inflammatory conditions in which oxidative stress occurs. Any changes in the levels of intracellular

Fig. 8. SIRT1-mediated regulation of eNOS. Oxidant/carbonyl stress downregulates the SIRT1 activity and level. This will regulate PARP1 and cause acetylation of Cav-1 and eNOS, which influences several cellular processes, such as apoptosis, angiogenesis, and vascular homeostasis in endothelial cells. PARP-1, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1; Cav-1, caveolin-1; eNOS, endothelial nitric oxide synthase; Ac, acetylation.

The emerging role of SIRT1 in cardioprotection [46,134,135]. Cigarette smoke-induced apoptosis of coronary arterial endothelial cells and inflammatory response were attenuated by SIRT1 overexpression [136]. One plausible mechanism for SIRT1's regulation of endothelial function involves a reduction in the activity of eNOS and caveolin-1. This may be due to endogenous or exogenous inhibition or reduction in the availability of its substrate L-arginine and/or decreased bioavailability of NO. Nisoli et al. [137] have shown that the levels of cGMP and eNOS are elevated in tissues of calorie-restricted mice, and the production of NO increases SIRT1 expression, which was blunted in eNOS-deficient mice. SIRT1 has been shown to bind to eNOS and to deacetylate lysines K496 and K506 in the calmodulin-binding domain of eNOS leading to enhanced production of NO (Fig. 8). This binding is essential for endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation, endothelial cell survival, migration, and postnatal neovascularization, whereas SIRT1 knockdown resulted in decreased NO production and impaired endothelial-dependent vasodilatation [69]. Interestingly, NO has been shown to activate the SIRT1 promoter leading to an increase in SIRT1 mRNA and protein, indicating that a positive feedback mechanism exists between SIRT1 and eNOS (Fig. 3). SIRT1 activation through small molecules may help to reset the activity of eNOS by keeping the Lys496 and Lys506 deacetylated during conditions of endothelial dysfunction in which NO availability is limited, particularly in susceptible chronic smokers.

Activation of SIRT1 by resveratrol protects endothelial cells against cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress [136]. Furthermore, cigarette smoke extract and H₂O₂ treatments caused dose-and time-dependent decreases in SIRT1 level and its deacetylase activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells [28] and in mice exposed to cigarette smoke [13,138]. These findings are in agreement with the recent reports showing that cigarette smoke-mediated oxidative stress decreased SIRT1 levels and its deacetylase activity associated with increased acetylation of eNOS, which was associated with increased proinflammatory gene expression [28,31]. This observation is further substantiated by the fact that cigarette smoke extract-induced oxidative stress resulted in increased eNOS acetylation in endothelial cells (acetylation leads to inactivation of eNOS activity) [28]. This study also showed that SIRT1 activation by a nonspecific SIRT1 activator, resveratrol, attenuated cigarette smoke-induced eNOS acetylation, whereas

SIRT1 inhibition by splitomicin further increased eNOS acetylation. These observations support the concept that activation of SIRT1 pharmacologically or by dietary polyphenol resveratrol may protect against deleterious effects of cigarette smoke/oxidants/carbonyls on endothelial dysfunction (presumably via deacetylation of eNOS resulting in availability of NO). This may be one of the possible mechanisms of resveratrol in maintaining or improving endothelial function. Furthermore, the levels and activity of SIRT1 are significantly decreased in lungs of atherosclerosis-prone ApoE⁻/⁻ mice with further reduction in response to cigarette smoke. This leads to increased acetylation and inactivation of eNOS in the lungs of ApoE⁻/⁻ mice exposed to cigarette smoke, resulting in endothelial dysfunction [138]. Further studies are required to determine whether oxidative stress or change in redox status of the cells can influence eNOS acetylation via SIRT1 and hence the NO bioavailability in endothelial cells. This will have implications in endothelial dysfunction and alterations in proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis in smokers and other inflammatory conditions in which oxidative/carbonyl stress occurs.

### SIRT1 and histone modifications

Posttranslational modifications on the complex structure of histone tails are a central mechanism for regulation of gene expression and are known as epigenetic chromatin remodeling [139]. These posttranslational modifications may facilitate the activation or repression of chromatin-mediated gene expression for inflammatory mediators, cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, senescence, antioxidants, growth factors, and tumor suppressor genes. Generally, acetylation of the histone tails correlates with activation of gene expression, whereas deacetylation is associated with gene silencing. The possible link to specific epigenetic modifications (e.g., acetylation of histones) on proinflammatory genes in various disease phenotypes might be due to the environment and alterations in patterns of gene expression.

SIRT1 is a histone/protein deacetylase and has been shown to be involved in deacetylation of histone proteins. In yeast, the SIRT1 homologue Sir2 associates with inactive telomeric chromatin and silences the transcription of ribosomal DNA and of mating-type loci [140]. It has also been reported that oxidative stress leads to redistribution of Sir2 on chromatin and increases cellular aging

[141]. In mammals, only SIRT1, SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT5 have a conserved deacetylase domain [140,142], and deacetylase activity seems to be restricted to SIRT1-SIRT3. SIRT1 can affect the acetylation of the four core histones in vitro, but seems to preferentially deacetylate histone H3 on Lys9 and Lys14 (H3K9 and H3K14) and histone H4 on Lys16 (H4K16) [143,144]. Recently, SIRT1 was reported to form a complex with RelA/p65 and p300 at the Bcl2-associated factor 1 (Bclaf1) promoter region to regulate Bclaf1 expression by suppressing H3K56 acetylation, thereby reducing T cell activation, but has no effect on B cell activation, demonstrating the cell-type-specific effect. Nevertheless, these findings suggest that SIRT1 via H3K56 deacetylation may have significant impact on innate and adaptive immune responses [145].

Histone H3K4 trimethylation opens chromatin for active gene transcription, whereas histone H3K9 and H3K27 trimethylation silences/represses gene transcription by closing the active chromatin [146]. The direct histone deacetylation activity of SIRT1 synergizes with facilitated trimethylation of H3K9 [143]. Trimethylation of H3 is a well-established mark of facultative heterochromatin and transcriptional repression and can occur under oxidative stress conditions. The mechanistic basis of the positive action of SIRT1 on H3K9 methylation to further repress transcription involves the activation of the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1 by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation [147]. SUV39H1 is regulated under oxidative stress conditions when SIRT1 is depleted in inflammation. Hence, in addition to histone acetylation, SIRT1 also indirectly regulates the methylation of histone by deacetylation of histone methyltransferase. SIRT1 interacts directly with, recruits, and deacetylates SUV39H1, which is the principal enzyme responsible for the accumulation of histone H3 containing a trimethyl group at its Lys9 position (H3K9me3). Elevated levels of SUV39H1 activity by SIRT1 result in increased levels of the H3K9me3 modifications [147]. Recently, it has been reported that SIRT1 physically associates and deacetylates the DNA methyltransferase 1 protein and alters its activities [148]. SIRT1 also deacetylates methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 [149], further highlighting the role of SIRT1 in genomic stability and epigenetic regulation. SIRT1 has been shown to dynamically interact with and regulate hMOF and Tip60 through deacetylation, implicating the regulatory role of SIRT1 in DNA damage response [150]. Any alterations of SIRT1 under oxidative stress may cause genomic instability leading to inflammatory response and cellular senescence.

The roles of other sirtuins (e.g., SIRT2, SIRT3, and SIRT6) in the regulation of histone acetylation are ascribed. SIRT2, despite its cytoplasmic localization, can deacetylate H4K16 and, to a lesser extent, H3K9, during mitosis when the nuclear envelope disassembles [151]. This suggests that SIRT2 could promote cell cycle progression by favoring the condensation of chromatin before chromosome segregation during mitosis. SIRT3 also exhibits histone deacetylase activity directed toward H3K9 and H4K16 in vitro [152]. Similarly, SIRT6 deacetylates H3K56 and has a deacetylase-independent poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation function during oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage [153–155]. However, the functional relevance of these modifications by SIRT2, SIRT3, or SIRT6 in maintaining genomic stability (deacetylation at the genome-wide level) under oxidative stress is not known. Recent studies have shown that SIRT6 regulates lifespan in male mice [156] and rescues the decline of homologous recombination repair during replicative senescence [157]. However, the role of SIRT6 in premature senescence is not known. SIRT1 is regulated by several microRNAs, such as miR-34a and miR-22, which are involved in cellular senescence via histone modifications [158]. Altogether, these studies have demonstrated that histones are the targets of sirtuin-mediated deacetylation facilitating heterochromatin formation as senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Further work is required to understand how the promoter-specific deacetylation of histones by sirtuins, particularly by SIRT1, can regulate histone acetylation/methylation during inflammatory response and cellular senescence.

SIRT1 and cellular senescence

Oxidative stress causes cellular senescence, and SIRT1 protects against premature aging/cellular senescence by regulating FOXOs, p53, and p21 as well as molecules involved in DNA damage and repair [12,32,159,160]. This is corroborated by a recent study showing that SIRT1 protects against cigarette smoke/oxidative stress-induced lung cellular senescence by regulating FOXO3 and prosenescence gene p21 [13]. In addition to FOXO3 and p21, SIRT1 prevented cellular senescence by deacetylation and repression of p53 [161]. Furukawa et al. [32] also reported that SIRT1 deficiency caused accumulation of p53 acetylation, thereby enhancing oxidative stress-induced cellular senescence. In stem and progenitor cells, SIRT1 also has an ability to regulate senescence and aging. Proteases, such as cathepsin, can cleave SIRT1 in endothelial progenitor cells, leading to stress-induced premature senescence [162]. The involvement of SIRT1 in maintaining the stem cell homeostasis is supported by a study showing requirement of SIRT1 for long-term growth of human mesenchymal stem cells without undergoing cellular senescence [163]. Also, SIRT1 is shown to play an essential role in the maintenance of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells [164]. Similarly, Homma et al. [165] have shown that SIRT1 plays an important role in mediating greater functionality of human embryonic stem (ES)/induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-derived vascular endothelial cells. This highlights a novel avenue for ES- and iPS-derived vascular endothelial cells as the cell source for regenerative medicine in inflamming and cellular senescence [166], particularly in response to oxidative and shear stresses [167]. SIRT1 also prevents replicative senescence of normal human umbilical cord fibroblasts by potentiating the transcription of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase gene [168]. Another study has reported the maintenance of telomeres by SIRT1 and the DNA repair enzyme XRCC6 [169]. These findings suggest a pivotal role for SIRT1 in regulating both replicative and premature senescence in stem and differentiated cells under conditions of oxidative stress. Therefore, the activation of SIRT1 in stem/progenitor cells or iPS-endothelial progenitor cells would be a promising therapeutic way to intervene in chronic inflammatory diseases associated with aging.

Dietary and pharmacological activation of SIRT1

Dietary phytochemicals

SIRT1 activators are emerging as key regulators in many diseases involved in inflammation, including type 2 diabetes, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and COPD [11–13,140,170–173]. SIRT1 is responsible for the beneficial effects of caloric restriction, and resveratrol mimics the effects of caloric restriction. Resveratrol was identified as the first natural chemical activator of SIRT1. Resveratrol (3,4′,5-trihydroxystilbene), a phytoalexin found in the skin and seeds of grapes, other plants, and plant-derived products (such as red wine), increases SIRT1 activity up to 8-fold (EC<sub>1.5</sub> = 46.2 μM, and maximum activation of SIRT1 of 201%), lowering the K<sub>m</sub> value for acetylated substrate by 35-fold and NAD<sup>+</sup> by 5-fold [174]. However, resveratrol is a nonselective and nonspecific compound that can regulate other pathways, such as Nrf2 and NF-κB [175,176]. Thus, doubt has been cast on whether resveratrol is an actual activator of SIRT1. One study has shown that increased SIRT1 deacetylation by resveratrol occurs only when the deacetylated protein substrate had a fluorophore attached, substrates

lacking the fluorophore did not show increased deacetylation by resveratrol, suggesting that resveratrol may not be a direct activator of SIRT1 [177]. Recent studies have highlighted that resveratrol may regulate the aging phenotype by an indirect mechanism independent of SIRT1 activation. For example, resveratrol ameliorates aging-related metabolic phenotypes by inhibiting cAMP phosphodiesterases leading to elevation of cAMP level, which then indirectly increases NAD⁺ and SIRT1 activity [178]. Similarly, another study reported that the cAMP/PKA pathway controls SIRT1 enzymatic activity independent of changes in NAD⁺ levels [179]. This may have implications in the treatment of patients with COPD, as PDE4 inhibition is known to play an important role in inhibiting inflammation in these patients. Resveratrol reduces vascular cell senescence through attenuation of oxidative stress by SIRT1/NADPH oxidase-dependent mechanisms [180]. Furthermore, red wine extract protects against oxidative stress-induced endothelial senescence via NO and cyclooxygenase-2-dependent mechanisms [181]. Calorie restriction-like effects of resveratrol supplementation on energy metabolism and metabolic profile have been shown in obese humans [182]. SIRT1 activation by resveratrol is also known to modulate matrix metalloproteinase (MMP1, MMP3, MMP9) activity in fibroblasts [183–186]. MMPs play an important role in inducing cellular senescence, and hence inhibition of MMPs will delay senescence-associated secretory phenotype. Other polyphenolic plant-derived compounds, such as butein, quercetin, piceatannol, and myricetin, have also been shown to activate SIRT1 [10, 12, 73]. These compounds have a modest ability to activate SIRT1, ranging from 3.19- to 8.53-fold, especially under oxidative stress conditions. Other dietary compounds may have also beneficial effects on the activation of SIRT1 and are yet to be explored. One notable example is sulforaphane, an activator of Nrf2, which may indirectly restore SIRT1 activity by reversing oxidative/carbonyl modifications of SIRT1 via activation of phase II detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes (carbonyl reductases, thioredoxin reductases), and hence possibly will reverse steroid resistance in patients with COPD and severe asthma. However, studies are required to test this functional activity of SIRT1 by dietary natural products.

### Pharmacological compounds

Recently, several selective SIRT1 activators were commercially developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which was acquired by GlaxoSmithKline [187–189]. These activators are analogues of resveratrol and include SRT1720, SRT2183, SRT501, SRT2104, SRT2379, and SRT1460, resVida, Longevinex [190], and a related compound, pyrroloquinoline. The most potent of the compounds was SRT1720 (EC₅₀ = 0.16 μM and maximum activation of SIRT1 of 781%), which improved glucose homeostasis and insulin sensitivity in three different animal models of type 2 diabetes and obesity [9, 188]. Furthermore, the efficacy and bioavailability of these compounds in humans are not known. A recent study by Hoffmann et al. [191] showed the pharmacokinetics and tolerability of SRT2104 for activation of SIRT1 after single and repeated oral administration in humans. Yao and colleagues [13] have recently shown that SRT1720 protects against cigarette smoke-mediated premature senescence and pulmonary emphysema in mice independent of inflammation. However, the effectiveness of these drugs for the treatment of diseases caused by oxidative/carbonyl stress, in which SIRT1 levels are decreased, remains to be determined.

### Conclusions

SIRT1 regulates inflammation, aging, calorie restriction/energetics, stress resistance, senescence, endothelial functions, apoptosis/autophagy, and other cellular functions through deacetylation of transcription factors and histones. SIRT1 undergoes reversible/irreversible covalent oxidative modification by cigarette smoke-derived oxidants and aldehydes, leading to inactivation and degradation. The carbonylation, S-nitrosylation, and S-glutathionylation of SIRT1 are attenuated by increasing intracellular thiols by NAC and glutaredoxin 1. Hence, SIRT1 is a redox-sensitive molecule. SIRT1 is regulated by PARP1 activation and subsequent NAD⁺ depletion in response to environmental/oxidative stresses, which may have subsequent effects on inflammatory and stress responses, as well as cellular senescence by regulating RelA/p65, FOXO3, p21, and p53. SIRT1 is also known to deacetylate eNOS and hence restore NO-mediated endothelial function. Overall, cigarette smoke/oxidant-mediated redox posttranslational modifications of SIRT1, via the loss of its function on its interacting molecules, such as PARP1, NF-κB, FOXO3 and eNOS, as well as chromatin remodeling/histone modifications, play a crucial role in inflammatory response and cellular senescence. SIRT1 activation by pharmacological agents is important, but it must be kept in mind that SIRT1 is a redox-sensitive protein and that a simple pharmacological activation of SIRT1 may not be effective. SIRT1 is covalently modified under oxidative/inflammatory conditions, hence a redox regulating agent to stabilize SIRT1 (e.g., reversal of carbonylation of SIRT1) may be an avenue before effective therapeutic strategies (pharmacological activation of SIRT1 along with stabilization of SIRT1) can be designed for chronic inflammatory diseases in which oxidative/carbonyl stress occurs. Furthermore, understanding the oxidant/carbonyl-mediated reduction and redox regulation/modifications of SIRT1 will have widespread implications for the understanding of the mechanisms of premature cellular senescence and the pathogenesis of various chronic inflammatory diseases in which oxidative/carbonyl stress occur.
