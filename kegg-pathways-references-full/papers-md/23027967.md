*Staphylococcus aureus* peptidoglycan (PG) is densely functionalized with anionic polymers called wall teichoic acids (WTAs). These polymers contain three tailoring modifications: D-alanylation, α-O-GlcNAcylation, and β-O-GlcNAcylation. Here we describe the discovery and biochemical characterization of a unique glycosyltransferase, TarS, that attaches β-O-GlcNAc (β-O-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine) residues to *S*. *aureus* WTAs. We report that methicillin-resistant *S*. *aureus* (MRSA) is sensitized to β-lactams upon *tarS* deletion. Unlike strains completely lacking WTAs, which are also sensitive to β-lactams, Δ*tarS* strains have no growth or cell division defects. Because neither α-O-GlcNAc nor β-O-Glucose modifications can confer resistance, the resistance phenotype requires a highly specific chemical modification of the WTA backbone, β-O-GlcNAc residues. These data suggest β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs scaffold factors required for MRSA resistance. The β-O-GlcNAc transferase identified here, TarS, is a unique target for antimicrobials that sensitize MRSA to β-lactams.

PBP2A | antibiotic resistance | beta lactam potentiation | murein | WTA glycosylation

Peptidoglycan (PG), a cross-linked polymeric matrix that surrounds bacterial cells, is essential for survival (1). It is a major target for clinically used antibiotics, including the β-lactams (2). Methicillin-resistant *Staphylococcus aureus* (MRSA) is responsible for a large percentage of β-lactam–resistant infections and there is an ongoing need for new strategies to treat these infections (3). Resistance in MRSA involves the acquired gene, *mecA*, which encodes PBP2a, a transpeptidase that functions to cross-link peptidoglycan strands when native transpeptidases are inactivated by β-lactams (4–6). Many other genes native to *S*. *aureus* must be present for *mecA*-mediated resistance to operate (7–10). Understanding how different factors participate in β-lactam resistance is of paramount importance for developing new approaches to combat MRSA.

Preventing wall teichoic acid (WTA) synthesis by blocking TarO, which catalyzes the first step in the WTA pathway, sensitizes MRSA to β-lactams (11, 12). *S*. *aureus* WTAs are covalently attached to PG and consist of a poly(ribitol phosphate) [poly(RboP)] backbone containing three tailoring modifications: D-alanylation, α-O-GlcNAcylation, and β-O-GlcNAcylation (Fig. 1) (13, 14). WTAs have been implicated in cell shape, cell division, biofilm formation, phage infectivity, and pathogenesis, and evidence suggests that the tailoring modifications contribute to these functions (13, 14). For example, D-alanylation promotes biofilm formation, increases resistance to cationic antibiotics, and plays a role in virulence, whereas O-GlcNAcylation is required for infection by serogroups A, B, and F phages of *S*. *aureus* (13–18).

We sought to determine whether the WTA polymer itself or a backbone modification regulates various WTA functions in *S*. *aureus*. Our studies required knowing the genes that encode the tailoring enzymes. The genes involved in D-alanylation and α-O-GlcNAcylation were previously identified, but the gene encoding the transferase that attaches β-O-GlcNAc residues to WTAs was not (19–23). Here we report the identification of this unique gene, *tarS*, and we profile the substrate preferences of the encoded β-O-GlcNAc transferase. We show that the WTA backbone is required for proper cell division, whereas β-O-GlcNAcylation is required to maintain β-lactam resistance in MRSA. Unlike Δ*tarO* MRSA strains, which are also β-lactam sensitive, Δ*tarS* strains have no morphological or cell division defects. Hence, the β-lactam susceptibility is not coupled to the global defects in cell division that occur in the absence of WTAs. Through genetic manipulations of WTA tailoring enzymes, we demonstrate that the proper stereochemical linkage of the sugar to the WTA backbone and the C2 N-acetyl substituent are required for the resistant phenotype. Because the structural features required are specific, we speculate that β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs interact with cell surface factors necessary for β-lactam resistance. We conclude that TarS is a unique possible target for inhibitors to be used in combination with β-lactams to overcome MRSA infections.

## Results

### Identification of a β-O-GlcNAc Transferase in *S*. *aureus*

We recently identified a phage-resistant *S*. *aureus* strain, K6, which produces nonglycosylated WTAs (21). This strain carried a transposon in the *tarM* gene, and the encoded TarM protein was identified as a WTA α-O-GlcNAc transferase. We subsequently found that a targeted *tarM* deletion strain, RN4220Δ*tarM*, is still susceptible to *S*. *aureus* serogroup B phages φ11, φ52A, and φ80 (Fig. 2A). Because phage infection depends on WTA glycopeptides (18), these data suggested that WTAs are glycosylated in the RN4220Δ*tarM* strain. NMR analysis of WTAs from the Δ*tarM* strain showed a WTA structure consistent with β-O-GlcNAcylated ribitol phosphate (Fig. 2B and C) (24). Thus, *S*. *aureus* strain RN4220 contains a β-O-GlcNAc transferase in addition to the previously identified α-O-GlcNAc transferase.

Two putative glycosyltransferase-encoding genes, designated SAOUHSC_00644 and SAOUHSC_00228, were identified in WTA operons of *S*. *aureus* NCTC8325 (Fig. S1). We used an in vitro reconstitution approach to test their function as WTA β-O-GlcNAc transferases. Each gene was overexpressed as an N-terminal 10-His fusion protein in *Escherichia coli* and purified by Ni${}^{2+}$-affinity chromatography. The poly(RboP)-WTA substrate was synthesized in vitro using a combined chemical and enzymatic approach (Fig. 3A), and the purified proteins were incubated with this polymer substrate and UDP-[${}^{14}$C]-GlcNAc. Reaction mixtures were separated by PAGE and analyzed using phosphorimaging. No reaction was detectable under any conditions in incubation mixtures containing protein encoded by SAOUHSC_00644, and

Fig. 1. Wall teichoic acids in S. aureus contain three different types of tailoring modifications. S. aureus WTAs are composed of ribitol-phosphate repeats (two repeats are shown in red) tailored with D-alanines, α-O-GlcNACs, and β-O-GlcNACs. Enzymes responsible for α-O-GlcNAcylation and D-alanylation were previously identified. The enzyme (blue arrow) that attaches β-O-GlcNACs to poly(RboP)-WTA was unidentified before this work.

the function of this protein remains unknown. However, in reactions containing protein encoded by gene SAOUHSC_00228, the radiolabeled sugar starting material disappeared and radio-labeled products having similar mobility to [14C]-WTA polymers appeared (Fig. 3B). We conclude that SAOUHSC_00228 encodes a WTA glycosyltransferase, which we designated TarS.

TarS Prefers UDP-GlcNAc as a Donor Substrate and Is Specific for Poly (Ribitol Phosphate) WTAs. Most S. aureus strains attach O-GlcNAc to their WTAs, whereas other bacterial strains attach glucose, GalNAc, or other carbohydrates (15). To examine the donor specificity of TarS, we tested its ability to use four other UDP sugars as donors for glycosylation of poly(RboP)-WTA (Fig. 3B). The results showed that TarS can use UDP-Glc and UDP-GalNAc as alternative donor substrates, but not UDP-galactose or UDP-glucuronic acid. Thus, structural changes at either the C2 or C4 positions of the sugar donor are tolerated, although UDP-GalNAc is a far less efficient substrate than UDP-GlcNAc or UDP-Glc. In TarS reactions incubated with poly(RboP)-WTA and equimolar amounts of UDP-GlcNAc and UDP-Glc, the UDP-GlcNAc peak disappeared, whereas the UDP-Glc peak area was largely unchanged, indicating that UDP-GlcNAc is the preferred donor (Fig. 3C).

We tested the ability of TarS to transfer GlcNAc to possible alternate acceptors. Using different combinations of previously characterized WTA biosynthetic enzymes (25–27) we prepared a WTA pathway intermediate for acceptor testing. CDP ribitol, ribitol phosphate, lipoteichoic acid (LTA), and poly(GroP)-WTA were also tested as acceptor substrates. No glycosylation of any of these substrates was observed (Fig. 3D and Fig. S2), showing that TarS is specific for substrates containing multiple RboP units. These data support the prediction that WTA glycosylation in S. aureus, as in Bacillus subtilis (28), occurs after polymer synthesis is complete.

TarS β-O-GlcNAcylates WTAs in S. aureus Cells. To investigate the function of TarS in cells, we deleted tarS from wild-type RN4220 and the RN4220ΔtarM strain and checked susceptibility of the mutants to phages φ11, φ52A, and φ80. The ΔtarS strain was as susceptible to the test phage as the parental and ΔtarM strains, but the ΔtarMΔtarS double mutant was phage resistant (Fig. 2A). To establish the anomeric stereochemistry of the TarS product, we extracted WTAs (25) from the deletion strains and analyzed NMR spectra of their monomer units. β-O-GlcNAcylated ribitol phosphates have an anomeric β-O-GlcNAc ¹H resonance at 4.73 ppm and a ¹³C resonance at 101.6 ppm (24). This peak is absent in WTAs extracted from the ΔtarMΔtarS strain, but is present in WTAs from the ΔtarM strain and the ΔtarMΔtarS strain expressing TarS from a plasmid (Fig. 2 B and C and Fig. S3). Thus, TarS β-O-GlcNAcylates WTAs in S. aureus.

The WTA Polymer Backbone, but Not Its Tailoring Modifications, Is Essential for Properly Regulated Cell Division. WTA null (ΔtarO) strains have several phenotypes. They are temperature sensitive,

wall–active antibiotics. Complementation of MW2ΔtarMΔtarS with a plasmid expressing catalytically active TarS restored wild-type resistance levels, whereas complementation with a plasmid expressing TarM or a catalytically inactive variant of TarS did not (Figs. S4B and S7 B and C). These results established that the sensitized phenotype of the tarS deletion strains is not due to polar effects, but to the lack of a functional WTA β-O-GlcNAc transferase. Consistent with the importance of tarS in mediating resistance, its expression was fourfold up-regulated in the presence of β-lactams, whereas the expression of tarM was unchanged (Fig. S8A). QRT-PCR analysis showed that expression of the gene encoding the β-lactam resistant transpeptidase PBP2a, mecA, was unaffected by tarS deletion, indicating that sensitivity is not due to down-regulation of the resistance determinant. Expression levels of several other genes implicated in β-lactam resistance, including pbp4 and fmtA, were also unaffected (Fig. S8B). Taken together, these results are consistent with a direct role for β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs in maintaining β-lactam resistance.

To obtain further information on the structural requirements of the WTA sugar residue in resistance, we sought to replace β-O-GlcNAc with another β-linked sugar. B. subtilis W23 makes poly(RboP)-WTAs containing β-O-glucose WTA modifications (31), but the tailoring enzyme had not been identified. There are four predicted glycosyltransferases, tarEMNQ, in the W23 WTA gene cluster. Since TarQ has the highest homology to TarS, we constructed two B. subtilis W23 strains, one containing a marked deletion of tarQ (W23ΔtarQ) and the other containing an additional deletion of genes tarEMN (W23ΔQΔtarEMN). Quadrupole (Q)TOF-MS analysis of extracted WTAs showed that glucosylation was absent in both mutant strains (Fig. S9A). Because deletion of tarQ was sufficient to abolish glucosylation, we concluded that TarQ is the primary WTA β-O-glucosyl transferase in B. subtilis W23. The tarQ gene was therefore expressed from a plasmid in MW2ΔtarMΔtarS, and this tarQ expression strain was shown to produce WTAs modified with glucose (Fig. S9B). However, unlike strains expressing tarS from a plasmid, this strain was not resistant to β-lactams (Fig. S7C). The resistance phenotype thus depends not only on the β-anomeric configuration of the WTA sugar modification, but also on the presence of a C2 N-acetyl moiety (Fig. 4C). Hence, the structural features required for resistance are specific, suggesting that β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs establish selective interactions with other cell surface factors required for resistance.

To determine whether β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs play a role in β-lactam resistance in other MRSA strains, we deleted tarS from four additional community- and hospital-acquired MRSA strains and measured their β-lactam MICs. These tarS deletion strains were also sensitized to β-lactams (Fig. S7D), implying that β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs are a general resistance factor in MRSA strains. Accordingly, TarS is a possible target for small molecules that sensitize MRSA to β-lactams.

Arrow points to the H-1 proton of the β-O-GlcNAc residue on ribitol phosphate. Peak corresponding to the amide of the C2 N-acetyl group attached to the sugar is identified as NHAc. Both the single knockout and the tarS-complemented strain produce β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs, but the double knockout does not. (Fig. S3) (C) Heteronuclear ¹³C,¹H single quantum correlation (HSQC) of the WTA monomer from the RN4220 ΔtarM strain. The H-1 proton of the β-O-GlcNAc residue is indicated by the arrow and confirms the signal at δ4.73 is indicative of a β-O-GlcNAc-ribitol-phosphate WTA monomer. These NMR data correlate with previous NMR analyses of β-O-GlcNAc-ribitol-phosphate WTA monomers (21, 24).

The double mutant, ΔtarMΔtarS, leads to resistance to serogroup B phages φ52A, φ11, and φ80. Mutation 201A, leading to a truncated tarS gene, was identified in the previously reported strain K6. This explains previous findings (21) that this strain, which contains a transposon insertion in tarM, is completely phage

The only tolerated acceptor substrate is poly(RboP)-WTA.

TarS Is Required for Oxacillin Resistance in a Caenorhabditis elegans Model. The bacterivorous nematode C. elegans dies upon ingestion of pathogenic S. aureus, and is commonly used as a simple model host to evaluate the virulence of different bacterial strains in the presence and absence of antibiotics (32, 33). Using this host, we evaluated the virulence of MW2ΔtarS compared with wild type, and determined bacterial susceptibility to treatment with oxacillin in vivo by evaluating nematode survival over time (Fig. S10). In the absence of antibiotic, the MW2ΔtarS strain was slightly attenuated compared with wild type, suggesting a modest role for the β-O-GlcNAc WTA moieties in pathogenesis in this system. At the highest tested dose, oxacillin partially rescued nematodes infected with wild-type MW2. In contrast, at the lowest dose tested, the antibiotic completely rescued animals infected with MW2ΔtarS. We conclude that β-O-GlcNAcylation of WTAs plays an important role in β-lactam resistance in vivo as it does in vitro.

Discussion

WTAs play an important role in regulating cell division in S. aureus and are also involved in maintaining resistance to β-lactams in MRSA strains (11). In this paper, we used biochemical and genetic approaches to examine the roles of the WTA polymer backbone and three tailoring modifications in these important phenotypes. We showed that the polymer backbone alone is required for properly regulated cell division because deletion of all three tailoring genes did not affect septal placement or cell separation. We also showed that a single WTA tailoring modification, β-O-GlcNAcylation, mediated by a newly discovered glycosyltransferase named TarS, is required to maintain wild-type levels of β-lactam resistance.

The mechanism by which β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs confer resistance to β-lactams in MRSA is not yet known. TarS deletion does not cause apparent growth or cell division defects and its deletion does not down-regulate expression of *mecA* or other tested genes implicated in β-lactam resistance. MRSA β-lactam resistance cannot be suppressed by expressing glycosyltransferases that incorporate either α-O-GlcNAs or β-O-glucose residues into WTAs. Because the susceptibility phenotype seems directly attributable to the absence of the β-O-GlcNAc modifications on WTAs, we propose a scaffolding role for β-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs in methicillin resistance. Consistent with this hypothesis, it has been previously speculated that WTAs can scaffold PG synthesis and degradation proteins (11, 34–36). Moreover, a recent paper has shown that both PBP2a and FmtA directly bind WTAs in vitro.

Fig. 4. The anionic WTA polymer backbone, but not any tailoring modifications, is required for proper cell division. $\beta$-O-GlcNAc WTA modifications are required for $\beta$-lactam resistance in MRSA. (A) TEM images of MW2 wild type, a WTA null strain ($\Delta tarO$), and two strains containing deletions in genes responsible for WTA tailoring modifications show that deleting WTAs leads to dysregulated cell division. No obvious morphological abnormalities are observed in cells lacking WTA decorations. (Scale bars, 500 nm.) (Fig. S6) (B) MIC values ($\mu$g/mL) of tested antibiotics against *S. aureus* strains. Data representative of at least six experiments. Highlighted values differ from wild type by at least fourfold. $\beta$, $\beta$-lactams; C, cationic antibiotics. $\Delta tarS$, like $\Delta tarO$, is susceptible to all tested $\beta$-lactams. Consistent with previous results, the $\Delta dltA$ strain is more susceptible to cationic antibiotics than wild type. (Fig. S7 A and D) (C) Graphic table of results showing only MRSA strains that contain $\beta$-O-GlcNAc WTA modifications are able to maintain $\beta$-lactam resistance. MRSA strains containing $\beta$-O-glucose or $\alpha$-O-GlcNAc WTA substituents are sensitive to $\beta$-lactams. MICs are tabulated in Fig. S7C.

(37). Polyvalent scaffolding by glycopolymers (glycolipids and glycoproteins) is a known mechanism for organizing proteins in a variety of biological processes (38, 39). Whereas there are no genes of high homology to $tarS$ in *Staphylococcus sciuri*, the organism from which PBP2a was speculated to derive (40, 41), all deposited *S. aureus* strain sequences in the National Center for Biotechnology Information contain $tarS$. It is possible that PBP2a may exploit $\beta$-O-GlcNAcylated WTAs by binding to them directly or by interacting with other cellular factors that are scaffolded by these polymers. There are many genes native to *S. aureus* that have been shown to play a role in maintaining $\beta$-lactam resistance (7–10), including genes encoding proteins with extracellular domains that could interact with $\beta$-O-GlcNAc WTA tailoring modifications.

In closing, we note that there is considerable interest in compounds that restore $\beta$-lactam sensitivity to resistant microorganisms (42). Because $\beta$-lactam resistance in MRSA involves a resistant transpeptidase that depends on the function of other cellular factors for activity (4–6), compound combinations that target the activity of these other factors could be useful for overcoming MRSA infections. $\beta$-lactamase inhibitors have been highly successful as components of compound combinations to treat many $\beta$-lactam-resistant infections (2, 3). Because deletion of the $tarS$ gene sensitizes MRSA to

$\beta$-lactams, we propose that TarS is a unique target for compounds used in combination with $\beta$-lactams to treat MRSA infections.

The bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers for PCR amplification are listed in Table S1. More detailed methods can be found in [SI Materials and Methods](http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2300000110).

#### Cloning, Overexpression, and Purification of SAOUHSC_00228 and SAOUHSC_00644

Genes were PCR amplified from RN4220 DNA ligated into a pET-47b(+) vector (Novagen), which had been modified to a cleavable N-terminal His-tag with 10-His residues transformed into Rosetta2(DE3)pLysS cells for overexpression by isopropyl-$\beta$-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 °C. The cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM Tris·HCl pH 8, 200 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, and 25% (vol/vol) glycerol, benzonase, and rLysozyme (Novagen) was added and the cells sonicated. The clarified lysate was purified using nickel resin. Purified protein was stored as 50% (vol/vol) glycerol stocks at either –20 °C or –80 °C. The yield is ~5 mg/L for SAOUHSC_00228 and 33 mg/L for SAOUHSC_00644.

#### SAOUHSC_00228 and SAOUHSC_00644 Substrate Testing Reactions

Three-microliter reactions containing 15 $\mu$M 228 or 130 $\mu$M 644, 20 mM Tris pH 8, 5 mM MgCl₂, 63 $\mu$M UDP-sugar, 7 $\mu$M UDP-[¹⁴C]-sugar, and 7 $\mu$M purified neryl-polyRboP-polymer or 5 $\mu$M UDP-[¹⁴C]-GlcNAc and 15 $\mu$M ribitol-5-phosphate, CDP-ribitol, or farnesyl-PP-GlcNAc-ManNAc-GroP-RboP were constructed. Three-microliter reactions contained 7 $\mu$M neryl-PP-GlcNAc-ManNac-GroP,
700 μM CDP-glycerol, 20 mM Tris pH 8, 5 mM MgCl2, 500 nM TagF, 10 μM 228 or 130 μM 644, 7 μM [14C]-UDP-GlcNAc, and 63 μM UDP sugar. As a control to ensure TagF activity, the reaction was also set up in the same manner except with the addition of 21 μM CDP-[14C]-glycerol and cold UDP-GlcNAc. Reactions testing LTA (Sigma) were set up in a similar manner except TagF and CDP-glycerol were omitted. As a negative control, identical reactions were set up using heat-treated enzyme. After 2 h at room temperature the reactions were quenched with an equal volume of dimethylformamide and analyzed by gel electrophoresis and phosphorimaging.

were made using the pMAD plasmid. The ΔdltA strain is identical to that which was published previously (16). For MW2 deletions, the plasmid was first passaged through RN4220. The *tarS/tarM* deletion strains were back complemented with TarS by cloning the gene into the pLI50-PcadC shuttle expression vector under the control of a cadmium-inducible promoter. The D92A, D94A inactive TarS point mutant was made using the QuikChange Lightning (Agilent) kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
