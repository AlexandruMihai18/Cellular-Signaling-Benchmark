### Abstract

Synthesis of tri-iodothyronine (T₃) and thyroxine (T₄) follows a metabolic pathway that depends on the integrity of the thyroglobulin structure. This large glycoprotein is a homodimer of 660 kDa synthesized and secreted by the thyroid cells into the lumen of thyroid follicle. In humans it is coded by a single copy gene, 270 kb long, that maps on chromosome 8q24 and contains an 8.5 kb coding sequence divided into 48 exons. The preprotein monomer is composed of a 19-amino acid signal peptide followed by a 2749-amino acid polypeptide.

In the last decade, several mutations in the thyroglobulin gene were reported. In animals, four of them have been observed in Afrikander cattle (p.R697X), Dutch goats (p.Y296X), cog/cog mouse (p.L2263P) and rdw rats (p.G2300R). Mutations in the human thyroglobulin gene are associated with congenital goiter or endemic and nonendemic simple goiter. Thirty-five inactivating mutations have been identified and characterized in the human thyroglobulin gene: 20 missense mutations (p.C175G, p.Q310P, p.Q851H, p.S971I, p.R989C, p.P993L, p.C1058R, p.C1245R, p.S1447N, p.C1588F, p.C1878Y, p.I1912V, p.C1977S, p.C1987Y, p.C2135Y, p.R2223H, p.G2300D, p.R2317Q, p.G2355V, p.G2356R), 8 splice site mutations (g.IVS3–3C>G, g.IVS5+1G>A, g.IVS10–1G>A, g.IVS24+1G>C, g.IVS30+1G>T, g.IVS30+1G>A, g.IVS34–1G>C, g.IVS45+2T>A) 5 nonsense mutations (p.R277X, p.Q692X, p.W1418X, p.R1511X, p.Q2638X) and 2 single nucleotide deletions (p.G362fsX382, p.D1494fsX1547).

The thyroglobulin gene has been also identified as the major susceptibility gene for familial autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD) by linkage analysis using highly informative polymorphic markers. In conclusion the identification of mutations in the thyroglobulin gene has provided important insights into structure–function relationships.

1. Introduction

Normal biosynthesis of thyroid hormones requires the integrity of a complex protein system and several sequential steps [1–5]. The most abundant expressed protein in the thyroid gland is thyroglobulin (Tg), which functions as the matrix for thyroid hormone synthesis and in the storage of the inactive form of thyroid hormone and of the iodine. Iodine enters the thyroid follicular cell as inorganic iodide and is transformed in organic form by the iodination of specific iodotyrosyl residues of Tg [5]. The iodide transport consists of two steps and involves transporters located either in the basal or apical membranes (Fig. 1). Iodide is accumulated from the blood into the thyroidal cell through the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) localized in the basolateral membrane [6]. On the other hand, the pendrin, located in the apical membrane, is responsible for the iodide transport from epithelial cell to follicular lumen [7,8]. Rodriguez et al. identified a new putative iodide transport in the apical membrane, named hAIT for human Apical Iodide Transporter [9].

The step preliminary to thyroid hormone formation is the oxidation of iodide, then, the attachment of iodine to tyrosyl residues in Tg is produced to generate MIT and DIT [5]. The final step is the coupling of two iodotyrosyl residues to form iodothyronine, two DIT form T₄, one DIT and one MIT form T₃ (Fig. 1). TPO is the key enzyme in the thyroid hormones formation; it catalyzes both the iodination and coupling of hormonogenic tyrosyl residues of Tg with an absolute requirement of hydrogen peroxide, which acts as an electron acceptor [10–12]. H₂O₂ is generated on the apical plasma membrane of the thyroid follicular cell by a metabolic pathway, involving two members of the NADPH oxidase family (Duox1 and Duox2) [13,14]. Recently, a thioredoxin-related protein named EFP1 (EF-hand binding protein 1) was identified as a novel partner in the assembly of the multiprotein complex constituting the thyroid H₂O₂ generating system [15]. Afterwards, the hormones are released from Tg by proteolysis (Fig. 1). The action of thyroid hormones is mediated by T₃, by binding to the nuclear receptor [2,5]. Thyroid hormone receptors regulate the transcription of target genes by binding to

thyroid hormone response elements (TREs) in their promoter regions. Thyroid hormone receptors bind to TREs as homodimers or heterodimers with retinoid X receptors.

The general organization of the Tg gene and its mRNA has been studied in detail by several groups [16–45]. Deeper function–structure relation features remain unresolved because of our lack of knowledge about the three-dimensional structure of the protein.

Inactivating mutations of the Tg gene have been identified in humans in the last decade, resulting in structural defects and endoplasmic reticulum retention of Tg proteins, and have been linked to subsequent thyroid hormone-impaired and primary congenital goiter with hypothyroidism or euthyroidism [46–65]. Mutations in Tg gene also have been reported associated with endemic [66] and nonendemic goiter [67,68]. Congenital hypothyroidism occurs with a prevalence of approximately 1 in 4000 newborns [69,70]. Patients with this syndrome can be divided into two groups: nongoitrous (dysembryogenesis) and goitrous (dyshormonogenesis) congenital hypothyroidism. The dysembryogenesis or dysgenesis group, which accounts for 85% of the cases, results from ectopy thyroid tissue at the base of the tongue or in any position along the thyroglossal tract, agenesis and hypoplasia. In a minority of these patients, the congenital hypothyroidism is associated with mutations in genes responsible for the development or growth of thyroid follicular cells: thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1, also known as TITF1, NKX2-1 or T/EBP) [71–73], thyroid transcription factor 2 (TTF-2, also known as TITF2, FOXE1 or FKHL15) [74], paired box transcription factor 8 (PAX-8) [75–78], thyrotrophin (TSH) [79,80] and TSH receptor genes [81–83]. The presence of congenital goiter (which accounts for the remaining 15% of the cases) has been linked to mutations in the NIS [84–86], Tg [46–65], TPO [87–93], DUOX 2 [94–96] and PDS genes [97,98]. These mutations originate a heterogeneous spectrum of congenital goitrous, transmitted in an autosomal recessive mode. The patients with Tg synthesis defects present a congenital goiter, hypothyroidism or euthyroidism, high iodide ${}^{131}$I uptake, normal organification of iodide, elevated serum TSH with simultaneous low or normal serum $T_{4}$ and $T_{3}$ levels, and low serum Tg concentration in relation to the degree of TSH stimulation [69,70]. Neonatal thyroid screening programs have been largely successful in diagnosis and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism. The early identification and treatment of congenital hypothyroidism are effective in preventing mental retardation and the other long-term consequences of hypothyroidism in most cases.

The Tg gene has been identified as the major susceptibility gene for familial autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), by linkage analysis using highly informative polymorphic markers [99–105].

This paper reviews the recently advances in our knowledge of Tg disorders, in man and animals, their pattern of inheritance, genetic markers, mutational processes and pathogenesis mechanism, with special emphasis on the genetic mechanism responsible for congenital goiter.

### 2. The nucleotide and amino acid nomenclatures

The nucleotide position in human Tg mRNA is designated according to reference sequences (GenBank accession number NM_003235). The A of the ATG of the initiator methionine codon is denoted nucleotide +1. The amino acid positions are numbered after subtracting the 19-amino acid signal peptide. Intronic nucleotides located upstream have negative numbering, while those located downstream have positive numbering.

### 3. The thyroglobulin gene: structure, expression and regulation

Tg is a homodimeric glycoprotein of 660 kDa synthesized and secreted by the thyroid cells into the follicular lumen. Tg is synthesized as a 12 S molecule, but forms 19 S homodimers and even 27 S tetramers. In human, it is coded by a single copy gene, 270 kb long (Table 1) [36,38–40], that maps on chromosome 8q24.2–8q24.3 [41–45] and contains an 8.5 kb coding sequences divided into 48 exons, separated by introns varying in size up to 64 kb (GenBank accession number NT_008046) [36,38–40]. The 64 kb intron (intron 41) of the Tg gene is an example of a large intron containing a small gene [106]. This gene codes for the human Src-like adaptor protein and appears to be transcribed in the opposite direction to Tg.

Tg gene expression is controlled positively by TSH through the modulation of the intracellular level of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) via its receptor (TSHr) located at the basal membrane of the cell [107–117]. Transcription of the Tg gene is regulated by thyroid-specific transcription factors TTF-1 [118,119], TTF-2 [120–122] and PAX-8 [123]. It is mediated by binding to the Tg promoter on their consensus sequences [124–126].

The human Tg mRNA is 8449–8468 kb long [127–131]. The general organization of the sequence showed a 41-nucleotide 5′-untranslated segment, followed by a single open reading frame of 8307 bases and a 3′-untranslated segment ranging from 101 up to 120 bp. Tg mRNA in human thyroid tissues is very heterogeneous due to 21 nucleotide polymorphisms [56,65,130–132], 11 alternatively spliced transcripts [130,133–137] and 4 polyadenylation cleavage site variants [132]. The preprotein monomer is composed of a 19-amino acid signal peptide followed by a 2749 residues polypeptide [129,132] (Fig. 2). The 80% of the monomer primary structure is characterized by the presence of three types of repetitive units [129,132]. The remaining 20%, that constitutes the carboxy-terminal domain of the molecule, is not repetitive and shows a striking homology with acetylcholinesterase (ACHE) [138,139]. This suggests a probable convergent origin of the Tg gene from different ancestral DNA sequences. The relation between the three families of cysteine-rich repetitive units and the intron–exon junctions organization was analyzed [40]. The monomer contains eleven Type 1, three Type 2 and five Type 3 repeat motifs (Fig. 2). The analysis in detail of the repeats showed the following distribution: (i) Repeats Type 1, 2, 4, 7, 10 and 11 are each encoded by a single exon (exon 4, 8, 10, 16 and 22, respectively), repeats 1 and 9 by two exons (exon 2 and 3, and 14 and 15, respectively), repeats 3 and 8 by three exons (exon 5, 6 and 7 and 11, 12 and 13, respectively) and repeats 5 and 6 are a fraction of exon 9. (ii) The three Type 2 repetitive elements map between exons 20 and 21. (iii) The Type 3 domain includes two subtypes, 3a and 3b, and map between exons 23 and 37 (3a-1: between exons 23 and 26, 3b-1: between exons 26 and 30, 3a-2:

[52,150,151] and may serve to prevent the exportation of improperly folded Tg proteins. This process is known as ER quality control machinery [152].

On the other hand, Tg interacts with several proteins of the apical membrane in the exocytosis and endocytosis pathways of thyrocytes, such as Apical Membrane Asialoglycoprotein Receptor (ASGPR) [153], Megalin [154–157] and Protein Disulfide Isomerase (PDI) [158,159] (Fig. 1). The ASGPR transports new synthesized Tg to the follicular lumen. It is hypothesized that the ASGPR is also indirectly involved in the endocytosis and proteolytic cleavage of highly iodinated Tg. The region of the Tg that interacts with the receptor is unknown. The Tg regulates the thyroid gene expression mediating the ASGPR [153]. It is interesting to note that the follicular Tg acts as a feedback sup-

pressor of the thyroid function [160,161], by inhibiting expression of TTF-1, TTF-2 and PAX-8 and consequently, decreasing expression of the Tg, TPO, NIS and TSHr genes. These findings support the idea that the Tg is not only the substrate for the biosynthesis of the thyroid hormones but also a regulator of the thyroid function, playing a role in transcriptional signaling or being related with some unknown mechanisms that remain to be determined.

Highly iodinated Tg is removed from the follicular lumen by internalization via pseudopod ingestion and micropinocytosis, followed by fusion of the endosome with a lysosome and its proteolytic cleavage. It has been reported that Megalin, a member of the low density lipoprotein receptor family, participates in the internalization of mature Tg as a high affinity receptor for Tg [155].

Megalin interacts with a heparin-binding region (SRRLKRP) in the carboxyl-terminal portion of rat Tg [155]. However, this domain was not detected in human Tg when we searched the complete Tg protein for heparin-binding consensus sequences, using the computer program. Megalin plays a role in intact Tg transcytosis from apical to the basolateral surface of the thyrocyte [156,157] (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the endocytosis for proteolytic cleavage in the lysosomal pathway occurs via other mechanisms, such as fluid phase uptake or uptake by other affinity receptors.

In addition, it has been suggested that at the apical surface of the thyroid cell a quality control mechanism exists, that prevents premature lysosomal transfer and degradation of immature Tg [158]. The immature molecules are internalized and recycled through the trans-Golgi compartments [162]. PDI is thought to be the candidate receptor that mediates the internalization [159] (Fig. 1). However, there are no further reports to substantiate that observation.

To complete the complex profile of the Tg protein, the 11 most prominent antigenic regions were characterized using monoclonal antibodies [163,164]. These antigenic regions likely play a role in the correct positioning of hormonogenic tyrosines so as optimize iodination-coupling reactions [164].

### 4. Thyroglobulin gene molecular markers

Highly informative Tg DNA polymorphic markers were identified and can be used in linkage studies in families with congenital hypothyroidism or autoimmunity thyroid diseases. The Tg DNA polymorphisms proved to be interesting and informative genetic markers which also investigate whether a common ancestral chromosome or a mutational hot spot accounted for the occurrence of the same mutation in the all affected individuals. The term DNA polymorphism refers to a wide range of variations in nucleotide base composition, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), insertion and deletion sequences (Indel), or length of nucleotide repeats. This later group includes two categories of multiallelic tandemly repeated DNA sequences. Loci with repeated motifs of a few base pairs are often referred to as short tandem repeats (STR) or microsatellites, while those with longer repeated motifs are referred to as variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) or minisatellites.

21 SNPs were identified and characterized in the coding sequence of the Tg gene, 14 of them resulting in amino acid polymorphisms: p.G58S, p.S715A, p.S715L, p.G796R, p.Q811E, p.R969P, p.M1009V, p.G1293D, p.T1479M, p.N1819D, p.R1980W, p.P2213L, p.W2482R, p.R2511Q [56,65,130–132] (Fig. 3, Table 2). There are no data on a putative functional role for these Tg changes.

A large insertion/deletion (Indel) polymorphism of 1464 bp localized in intron 18 of the human Tg gene was characterized [165]. Data from sequence showed a high A+T content (62%), a 17 bp-long motif (AAGAATTTTGGAGACA) was found repeated two times, located at 791 and 849 bp downstream from exon 18 and three different types of 10bp long palindromic sequences, ATTAGCTAAT, TTTTATAAAA and CAAA-TATTTG, were also found at positions 288, 870 and 1214,

respectively. In addition, three short (A)n repeat traits along the sequence were identified. A Long PCR method was used to amplify the genomic DNA region containing intron 17/exon 18/ intron 18/exon 19/intron 19 by primers situated in the introns 17 and 19. The amplification generates two fragments of 3.5 and 5.0 kb that correspond to the exclusion or inclusion of a 1464bp segment, respectively. Both variants are thus widely represented in the human population; giving allele frequencies of 0.56 (insertion) and 0.44 (deletion). The Indel polymorphism was analyzed also by multiplex PCR. The amplification generates two fragments of 374 bp (between 18 exonic forward primer and 18 intronic reverse primer) and 541 bp (between 18 intronic forward primer and 18 intronic reverse primer, indicating the exclusion or inclusion of the Indel polymorphic region, respectively. Genetic evidence indicates that the small additions and deletions can occur spontaneously during replication. Deletion and insertion also result from recombination events or activities of the transposable elements. GenBank database search showed that the 1464bp Indel polymorphism does not correspond to any known interspersed repetitive human sequence. However, it is not possible to exclude that some ancient transposable element, not identified in the intron 18, might have been involved in the development of this polymorphism.

STRs proved to be the most suitable markers in linkage analysis between a disease locus and a molecular marker, due to their diversity levels, high degree of resolution, relatively low mutation rates, high informativeness and rapid typing. Four STRs were identified and characterized within introns 10 (Tgms1), 27 (Tgms2), 29 (TGrI29) and 30 (TGrI30) of the Tg gene [100,166]. Tgms1 and Tgm2 consist of CA repeats and present 5 and 16 alleles, respectively. TGrI29 exhibited clearly 4 distinguishable alleles ranging from 197 to 203bp in length and TGrI30 showed 8 alleles ranging from 502 to 542bp. The heterozygosities (HET) observed of TGrI29 and TGrI30 were 0.859 and 0.522, respectively. The polymorphism information contents (PIC) were 0.471 and 0.434, respectively. No significant differences from Hardy-Weinberg values were found for these two systems. Sequencing analysis indicated that both loci are complex repeats, TGrI29 containing 2 types of variable motifs (TC)n and (TG)n, and TGrI30 a tetra-nucleotide tandem units (ATCC)n [166]. In two TGrI29 alleles and one TGrI30 allele were found two different subtypes in each one, with the same molecular weights but different distribution of the tandem repeats.

The availability of highly informative polymorphic markers will allow indirect disease diagnosis by genetic linkage studies, such as in cases with no identified mutations and for rapid identification of affected newborns or gene carriers in families with Tg mutations.

mutations (g.IVS3–3C>G, g.IVS5+1G>A, g.IVS10–1G>A, g. IVS24+1G>C, g.IVS30+1G>T, g.IVS30+1G>A, g.IVS34 –1G>C, g.IVS45+2T>A) 5 nonsense mutations (p.R277X, p. Q692X, p.W1418X, p.R1511X, p.Q2638X) and two single nucleotide deletions (p.G362fsX382, p.D1494fsX1547) [46– 65]. Fig. 3 and Table 3 summarize the reported inactivating mutations indicating the location of the mutation within the coding sequence or in the introns, and the amino acid alterations in the mature polypeptide.

In one such patient there was a defective synthesis of Tg due to the absence of exon 4 from the major Tg transcript because of a cytosine to guanine transversion at position minus 3 in the acceptor splice site of intron 3 (g.IVS3–3C>G) [46]. Removal of exon 4 does not modify the reading frame of Tg mRNA, producing an abnormal Tg devoid of the 68 residues. Exon 4 encodes tyrosine 130 which has been proposed as an important donor tyrosine involved in the synthesis of thyroxine, after coupling with the major acceptor tyrosine at position 5 [142– 144]. The deletion is localized in the Tg Type 1 repeat domain.

An aberrant splicing due to a guanine to thymine transversion at position +1 in the donor splice site of intron 30 (g.IVS30+ 1G>T) was identified in two members of a family with a history of congenital goiter [51,57]. Both affected patients are homozygous for the mutation. The elimination of 138 nt corresponding to exon 30 does not affect the reading frame of the resulting mRNA and is potentially fully translatable into a Tg polypeptide chain that is shortened by 46 residues. The functional consequences of the deletion are related to structural changes in the protein molecule that either could modify the normal routing of the translation product through the membrane system of the cell [52] or could impair the coupling reaction. However, small amounts of functionally active Tg could be iodinated, and immediately hydrolyzed, yielding mostly T3, because of the intense tissue stimulation by TSH. The deletion is localized in the TG type III repeat domain, causing the loss of 1 putative N-linked glycosylation site.

A non-consanguineous Brazilian family with two affected siblings and a nephew presenting congenital goiter, hypothyroidism, and marked impairment of Tg synthesis was extensively studied by Targovnik et al. [47,49,53,69,61]. Molecular studies indicated that the affected individuals are either compound heterozygous for p.R277X/g.IVS34–1G>C or p.R277X/p. R1511X [59]. The p.R277X mutation (c.886C>T) in exon 7 is the most frequently reported mutation in the Tg gene [55,59,60]. Recently, a new case of congenital goiter with hypothyroidism caused by a homozygous p.R277X was reported [48,60].

References: [56, 65, 130–132]. The nucleotide position is designated according to Tg mRNA reference sequences (GenBank accession number: NM_003235).

comparison of the Tg polymorphic markers identified in this patient with a member of the Brazilian family, who also carry the mutation as a compound heterozygous mutation [59], revealed that the two affected individuals do not share a common Tg allele, supporting that a mutational hotspot mechanism is responsible of the p.R277X mutation [60]. The truncated p.R277X form of Tg still harbors both the acceptor tyrosine 5 and the donor tyrosine 130 [143, 144]. Consequently, a 26 kDa aminotermminus Tg peptide retained its ability for T4 synthesis. In agreement with this observation it should be considered that the small p.R277X pep- tide is sufficient for the synthesis of T4 in the N-terminal domain. However, the premature stop codon eliminates the carboxy- terminal hormonogenic domain, resulting in the loss of thyroid hormone formation. The glycosylation of the Tg is an essential process that permits the migration from the ER to the Golgi. In vitro expression of the truncated p.R277X Tg cDNA showed that the mutated Tg protein can be glycosylated [55], indicating their possible exportation to apical surface of thyrocytes. The RT-PCR analysis [49, 55, 60] excluded an alternative splicing mechanism, by exon skipping, in order to restore the normal reading frame disrupted by the nonsense mutation and eliminate the stop codon which would truncate the protein.

The c.4588C>T transition in exon 22 is also characterized by a predicted premature stop codon which results in a truncated protein of 1510 amino acids, p.R1511X [49, 53, 59, 61]. However, the nonsense mutation is, thus, removed from the transcripts by exon skipping and there is a preferential accumulation in the goiter of a Tg mRNA lacking exon 22 [49, 59]. Interestingly, skipping of mutated exon 22 in the pre-mRNA restores the reading frame allowing translation to reach the normal stop codon. This alter-

native splicing is also present in mRNA from normal thyroid tissue, but it represents a minor fraction of the total Tg transcripts [135]. The excision of exon 22 in the Tg mRNA results in an in-frame deletion of 57-amino acid residues, which is localized in the TG Type 1 repeat motif. The alternative TG transcript lacking exon 22 constitutes a new case of nonsense-associated alternative splicing [61]. The construction and expression of the minigenes showed that the c.4588C>T mutation itself does not interfere with exon definition and processing in vitro [61]. The nonsense mutations in exon 7 and 22 occur in a CpG dinucleotide sequence and could be caused by deamination of a methylated cytosine resulting in a thymine. The CGA arginine codon is considered a “hotspot” for mutations in mammalian DNA. The functional consequences of the deletion of exon 22 could be structural changes in the protein molecule that alter the normal protein folding and assembly, leading to a marked reduction in the ability to export the protein from the ER. Alternatively, it is possible that the elimination of exons containing repeat motifs by alternative splicing results in an altered ability to transfer an iodophenoxyl

group from the donor site to the acceptor iodotyrosine in the coupling machinery [59]. Cysteines are thought to play an important role in the tertiary structure of Tg, being five residues localized in exon 22. Exon 22 contains a tyrosine residue, at position 1510, that might be involved in hormonogenesis. The c.4588C>T mutation eliminates a restriction site for Taq I.

A third mutation was identified in the familiar group described above consisting of a guanine to cytosine transversion at position-1 in the acceptor site of intron 34 (g.IVS34–1G>C) [59]. This discovery infers the possibility that this splice site mutation might generate a total elimination of exon 35 of the Tg gene, since removal of 63 nucleotides maintains the reading frame. Exon 35 is the smallest exon of the TG gene and is flanked by two large introns (intron 34: 10,608 bp, intron 35: 28,488 bp). It is conceivable that intron size could affect the splicing. Gutnisky et al. [59] used an *in vitro* exon-trapping system to evaluate if the g.IVS34–1G>C mutation produces an abnormal transcript, by a defect in exon splicing. Minigenes were constructed using the pSPL3 vector which has a minimal gene organization: the SV40 promoter followed by an exon–intron–exon structure with a multiple cloning site (MCS) located inside the intron. When a fragment cloned in the MCS contains functional exons with their corresponding splicing sites, they are included in the mature mRNA. *In vitro* transcription showed that the mutation in the acceptor splice site causes the skipping of the exon 35. The excision of exon 35 in the Tg mRNA results in an in-frame deletion of 21-amino acid residues, which are located in the Tg Type 3 repeat motif [59].

A compound heterozygous mutation in the Tg gene was identified in a family with two affected siblings with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism [58]. The paternal mutation consists of a cytosine deletion at nucleotide position 1143 in exon 9 (c.1143delC), resulting in a frameshift at amino acid 362 which generates a stop codon at position 382 in the same exon (p.362fsX382). The maternal mutation is a guanine to adenine substitution at position 6725 in exon 38 (c.6725G>A), creating the p.R2223H missense mutation in the ACHE-homology domain of Tg. The c.6725G>A mutation eliminates a restriction site for Hae II. The wild-type arginine residue at position 2223 is strictly conserved in all species for which suitable Tg and ACHE sequences have been reported [58]. Computer analysis of the protein’s secondary structure showed that the p.R2223H mutation causes an extended stretch of the helix structure. Consequently, the arginine residue in this position plays a critical structural role in the Tg protein and the p.R2223H mutation may cause structural instability leading to deficient Tg exportation [58].

Important insights into the consequences of Tg alterations have been obtained from studies of various missense mutations. Two substitutions that replace cysteine by either arginine or serine (p.C1245R and p.C1977S) in exons 17 and 33, cause an abnormal three-dimensional structure of Tg resulting in defective intracellular transport of Tg and retention in the endoplasmic reticulum [56]. Kitanaka et al. [63] identified a patient with congenital goitrous hypothyroidism, who has high serum triiodothyronine levels instead of low T4 and high TSH levels, due to a compound heterozygous mutation in the Tg gene. One of the mutations was a guanine to adenine transition at position 5690 in exon 31 (c.5690G>A), resulting in the substitution of cysteine by tyrosine in codon 1878

(p.C1878Y). The other was a guanine to adenine transition at position 7007 in exon 40 (c.7007G>A), resulting in the substitution of arginine by glutamine in codon 2317 (p.R2317Q).

Recent studies have shown that Tg gene mutations are associated with thyroid cancer development. Hishinuma et al. [62] reported patients with homozygous mutations (p.C1245R, p.C1977S and p.C1058R) or heterozygous compound (p.C1245R/p.G2356R). That alterations were missense mutations and were identified in papillary and follicular carcinoma, reflecting the fact that the incidence rate in patients with TG mutations was significantly higher. Subsequently, genomic sequencing of exon 15 of the BRAF gene, in cancerous tissue, revealed two heterozygous activating mutations (p.V599E and p.K600E) in two of these patients. On the other hand, Alzahrani et al. [64] identified a homozygous guanine to adenine point mutation at position +1 of the splice donor site of intron 5 (g.IVS5+1G>A) in Tg gene in a patient with recurrent goiter and a metastatic follicular thyroid carcinoma.

Recently, Hishinuma et al. [65] have reported 26 different inactivating mutations in the Tg gene in euthyroid to mildly hypothyroid, within the Japanese population, 20 are novel mutations: 12 missense mutations (p.C175G, p.Q310P, p.S971I, p.R989C, p.P993L, p.S1447N, p.C1588F, p.I1912V, p.C1987Y p.C2135Y, p.G2300D, p.G2355V), 4 splice mutations (g.IVS10-1G>A, g.IVS24+1G>C, g.IVS30+1G>A, g.IVS45+2T>A), 3 nonsense mutations (p.Q692X, p.W1418X, p.Q2638X) and one single nucleotide deletion (p.D1494fsX1547) (Fig. 3, Table 3). The patients harboring the frequent mutations p.C1058R and p.C1977S showed the same combinations of the SNPs in the coding region of the Tg gene [65]. Consequently, this finding suggests that the occurrence of these mutations is due to a founder effect.

## 6. Animal thyroglobulin gene mutations

Tg synthesis defects have been described not only in men, but also in cattle [167–173], goats [174–177], sheep [178–183], mouse [184–186], rats [187–190] and Bongo antelopes [191]. Hypothyroidism linked to Tg mutations have been reported in Afrikander cattle (p.R697X) [192–195], Dutch goats (p.Y296X) [196–198], cog/cog mouse (p.L2263P) [199] and rdw rats (p.G2300R) [200–202] (Table 4).

The congenital goiter of Afrikander cattle is an autosomal recessive disease characterized by Tg synthesis defect. Translation of goiter Tg mRNA produced no normal Tg protein [192,193], products of 250 and 75 kDa antigenically related to Tg were identified. The full-length bovine Tg mRNA contained an open reading frame of 8307 nt, which consists of a signal peptide of 19 residues and a mature protein of 2750 residues [31]. RNA analysis from affected animals revealed both a shorter (7300 nt) and normal sized TG mRNAs (8431) [193,194]. This shorter mRNA exists in low abundance in normal thyroid tissue, suggesting that it is normally produced by alternative splicing [194]. The 7300 nt mRNA encodes the 250 kDa peptide, whether the presence of the 75 kDa peptide was caused for an in-frame stop codon in the full-length mRNA. The mutation responsible for the diseases is a cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide position 2146 in exon 9 (c.2146C>T) that generates a stop codon at amino acid position

697 (p.R697X) [195,203]. The nonsense mutation is thus removed from the transcripts by exon skipping, and there is a preferential accumulation in the goiter of a 7300 nt mRNA lacking exon 9. The original reading frame is maintained in the shorter mRNA, which, as it lacks the mutated exon, is translatable into a potentially functional protein [195]. As was observed in human congenital goiter due to the p.R1511X mutation in the Tg gene, the nonsense mutation at codon 697 is expected to cause a dramatic destabilization of the full-length mRNA as a consequence of its limited translatability [195]. The 7300 nt mRNA preexisting as a minor mRNA species in normal animals, is actively translated into a 250 kDa Tg protein and escapes from the destabilization as it does not contain the stop mutation.

An inbred Dutch goat strain with hereditary congenital hypothyroidism and goiter was studied by de Vijlder et al. [174–177,196–198]. Tg antigens are found at 0.01% of the normal amount, sedimenting in a region corresponding to 200 kDa [176]. The goitrous Tg mRNA is present in reduced amounts, 2.5–10%. About 1% of the full-length Tg mRNA amount is found in the endoplasmic reticulum [176]. Translation of TG mRNA isolated from goiter in a cell-free system resulted in a 35 kDa Tg polypeptide [196]. The hereditary Tg synthesis defect in Dutch goats is caused by a cytosine to guanine mutation at position 945 (c.945C>G) that changes a triplet TAC coding for tyrosine (amino acid 296) in exon 8 into a triplet TAG giving a termination signal (p.Y296X) [198].

The cog/cog trait originally appeared as a spontaneous autosomal recessive phenotype in the inbred AKR/J strain of mouse [184 185]. A severe congenital hypothyroidism with colloid deficient goiter along with abnormal growth and central nervous system development was observed in cog/cog mouse, suggesting a defect of the Tg synthesis [186]. Tg mRNA was abundant and showed a normal size, but the reduced level of Tg protein exhibited enhanced susceptibility to proteolysis. The full-length mouse Tg mRNA contained an open reading frame of 8298 nt, which consisted of a signal peptide of 20 residues and a mature protein of 2746 residues [199]. Kim et al. [199] identified a missense mutation, contained within the ACHE-like domain of the Tg coding sequence, as the molecular basis for congenital hypothyroid goiter in cog/cog mouse. The thymine at nucleotide 6848 was substituted by cytosine (g.6848T>C), generating the p.L2263P mutation in the mature cog Tg protein [199]. The wild-type leucine residue in this position is conserved in all species for which suitable Tg sequence has been reported. Expression studies indicated that cog Tg exhibits a severe defect in the exit from the ER, whether the correction of this missense mutation restores the normal Tg secretion [199].

The rdw rat is a hereditary hypothyroid variant derived from the Wistar-Imamichi strain [187,188]. In contrast to human patients and animal models of congenital hypothyroidism, the rdw rat presents a hypoplastic thyroid gland that was smaller than the normal control, despite of the elevated circulating levels of TSH and the reduced level of T₃ and T₄. The immunohistochemical analysis showed that Tg was detected at very low levels in the colloid lumen with a substantial quantity in the dilated ER, suggesting an impaired intracellular transport of Tg [189]. Protein analysis revealed markedly elevated expression of molecular chaperones, GRP94, GRP78 and hsp70 [190]. The full-length rat Tg mRNA contained an open reading frame of 8304 nt, which consists of a signal peptide of 20 residues and a mature protein of 2748 residues [200,201,204–209]. The homology of the rat Tg with the mouse, bovine, and human TG is 90%, 76%, and 78%, respectively, at the nucleotide level; and 90%, 71%, and 74%, respectively, at the amino acid level. The complete sequencing of the rdw rat Tg cDNA revealed a single nucleotide change, the guanine at nucleotide 6958 was substituted with cytosine (g.6958G>C) [200,201]. The corresponding amino acid substitution was glycine with arginine (p.G2300R) at a position in the ACHE-like domain which is highly conserved in other mammalian species. As in cog/cog mouse models of defective Tg trafficking, the rdw Tg was retained inside the ER in cells that were transfected with the rdw Tg cDNA. The functional consequences of the missense substitution from a smaller neutral amino acid, glycine, to a larger basically charged amino acid, arginine, may have caused a conformational change in the C terminal region of Tg protein.

Baryshev et al. [202] demonstrated that the p.G2300R mutation in the rdw rat, as well as the p.C1245R and p.C1977S mutations in the human [56] induces the unfolded protein response (UPR). UPR is an adaptive cellular reaction that regulates the protein folding capacity of the ER perturbed by the excessive accumulation of the mutant secretory proteins. The UPR includes a transcriptional induction of molecular chaperones, via enhanced splicing of X-box binding protein (XBP1) or activated processing of activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) and general translational attenuation by PERKR-like ER kinase (PERK). In normal conditions, these sensors are silenced by interaction with a major ER chaperone, BiP. The processing of ATF6 was observed in both human and rat tissues with Tg mutations, whereas XBP1 splicing was detected only in the p.C1245R mutant [202].

cog/cog mouse and rdw rat models showed many similarities, both are associated with normal sizes and amounts of the Tg gene

transcripts, increased susceptibility to proteolysis of the mutant full-length Tg proteins, decreased synthesis and impairment of intracellular transport and marked accumulation of the chaperones, causing the named thyroidal ER storage diseases (ERSD) [199]. The only one important difference between the two models is the size of their thyroid glands. In the cog/cog mouse, the constant TSH stimulation leads to the development of a goiter, whether the rdw mutation is associated with a hypoplastic thyroid gland.

7. Thyroglobulin gene mutations in patients with nonendemic and endemic goiter

Nonendemic goiter is defined as an enlargement of the thyroid gland that is not the result of an inflammatory or neoplastic process, and is not associated with hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism, in most cases the cause is unknown. In contrast, the iodine deficient is the most relevant etiologic factor in endemic goiter.

Corral et al. [67] described three unrelated families with nonendemic goiter, transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode. Analysis by direct sequencing showed a guanine to thymine transversion at position 2610 in exon 10 (c.2610G>T), which replaces the wild-type glutamine at codon 851 by an histidine (p.Q851H) (Fig. 3, Table 3). The missense mutation was identified in heterozygous state in 25 of 56 members of the three families, 14 of the carriers had developed the disease. However, the putative function of this mutation in the goiter development is not yet clear. The p.Q851H mutation was not detected in the general population, suggesting that this change is not a polymorphism. Consequently, it is not possible to exclude that this substitution affects the protein expression, intracellular transport, or hormonogenesis. The p.Q851H mutation was also described in one case with endemic goiter [66].

A large heterozygous deletion that involves the promoter region and the 11 first exons of the Tg gene has been reported, linked to a nonendemic goiter [68].

8. Risk of non-medullary thyroid cancer associated to the p.R2511Q thyroglobulin gene polymorphism

Non-medullary thyroid cancer accounts 90% of all thyroid cancers. Matakidou et al. observed that the frequency of the R allele of p.R2511Q [131,132] was over-represented in non-medullary thyroid cancer cases, in two studied populations, compared with controls [210]. The odd ratios associated with heterozygosity and homozygosity for the R allele were 1.6 (95% confidence interval, 1.1–2.5) and 2.0 (95% confidence interval, 1.2–3.3), respectively. This substitution resides within the ACHE homologous domain of Tg [132]. However, the precise role of the Tg protein variants in non-medullary thyroid cancer remains to be established.

9. Thyroglobulin gene is an important susceptibility gene for autoimmune thyroid disease

The AITD are the most common human autoimmune diseases. There are two forms of AITD, Graves’ diseases, in which the production of TSHr stimulates antibodies causing hyperthyroidism, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, leading to hypothyroidism. Hashimoto’s thyroiditis is an organ specific disorder, in which the thyroid cells are selectively destroyed. Both forms are characterized by infiltration of the thyroid by T cells and production of antiTg and antiTPO antibodies. AITD are complex diseases caused by an interaction between immunomodulatory genes, thyroid autoantigen specific gene and environmental factors. Three immunomodulatory genes have been identified as susceptible markers of the disease: cytotoxic T lymphocyte-antigen 4 (CTLA4) [211], the HLA [212] and the CD40 genes [213,214]. The CTL4 is considered a down regulator of T cell function, playing a key role in autoimmunity.

Several predisposing loci have been mapped through the entire human genome in AITD [99,101]. The most important locus is the 8q24, which contains the Tg gene. The microsatellite inside intron 27 (Tgms2), was informative and it showed a significative association with AITD, suggesting that the Tg gene was the AITD susceptibility gene on 8q24 [100,102,105]. No significant association between AITD and the Indel Tg polymorphism was observed [103]. Moreover, genotyping studies in Caucasian subjects, using Tg SNPs, demonstrated that the exon 10–12 SNP cluster and the exon 33 SNP were significantly associated with AITD [103]. The analysis demonstrated also that the combination of these two SNP groups was more significantly associated with AITD. In addition, the exon 33 SNP showed strong evidence for interaction with HLA-DR3 in conferring susceptibility to Graves’ disease [215]. Interestingly, there is a significant association between the exon 10 SNP haplotype and murine experimental autoimmune thyroiditis. Fifty percent of the mouse strains susceptible to thyroiditis had the haplotype Ser–Met–Thr for exon 10, whereas all of the mouse strains that were resistant to thyroiditis had the haplotype Asn–Val–Ile [103]. These observations confirm that the Tg gene is an important susceptibility gene for AITD and demonstrated that the Tg is directly involved in the genetic etiology of AITD, both in human and in mouse. In this sense, it is interesting to hypothesize that the variations of the Tg protein structure may predispose to AITD by changing its antigenicity or its interaction with HLA molecules [103]. However, no evidence for association of exons 10, 12 and 33 SNPs with AITD was observed in Caucasian subjects by Collins et al. [104].

10. Conclusions and perspectives

The Tg is not only the substrate for the biosynthesis of thyroid hormones but also a regulator of thyroid function, playing a role in transcriptional signaling or being involved in some unknown mechanisms that remain to be explored. The identification, in the near future, of additional mutations in the Tg gene may provide important insights into structure–function relationships and may expand our knowledge of the molecular basis of familial hypothyroid or euthyroid goiter, resulting in a rapid prenatal diagnosis, and prevention of fetal hypothyroidism. Because the p.R277X, p.C1058R, p.C1245R and p.C1977S mutations are the most frequently reported mutations in the Tg gene, it would be helpful to investigate further cases with familial hypothyroid or euthyroid goiter, regarding these mutations. The identification of the Tg as an AITD susceptibility gene will enhance the prediction of individuals that are at high risk of developing the

diseases, as well as to understand the pathogenesis in order to establish the prevention and the best treatment of the disease. Further studies in the field of gene expression, molecular evolution and population genetics are necessary for elucidating the additional biological roles of the Tg.
