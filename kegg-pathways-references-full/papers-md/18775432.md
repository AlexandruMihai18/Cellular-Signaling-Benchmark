## ABSTRACT

*Toxoplasma gondii* is a unique intracellular parasite. It can infect a variety of cells in virtually all warm-blooded animals. It has a worldwide distribution and, overall, around one-third of people are seropositive for the parasite, with essentially the entire human population being at risk of infection. For most people, *T. gondii* causes asymptomatic infection but the parasite can cause serious disease in the immunocompromised and, if contracted for the first time during pregnancy, can cause spontaneous abortion or congenital defects, which have a substantial emotional, social and economic impact. *Toxoplasma gondii* provokes one of the most potent innate, pro-inflammatory responses of all infectious disease agents. It is also a supreme manipulator of the immune response so that innate immunity to *T. gondii* is a delicate balance between the parasite and its host involving a coordinated series of cellular interactions involving enterocytes, neutrophils, dendritic cells, macrophages and natural killer cells. Underpinning these interactions is the regulation of complex molecular reactions involving Toll-like receptors, activation of signalling pathways, cytokine production and activation of anti-microbial effector mechanisms including generation of reactive nitrogen and oxygen intermediates.

## 1. Introduction

*Toxoplasma gondii* is a ubiquitous coccidian parasite of the Phylum Apicomplexa, the largest and most important group of obligate parasites. It is unusual within this group in its capacity to parasitise a diverse array of cell types and infect virtually any warm-blooded animal. It is also unusual in the diversity of ways that it can be transmitted; these have been thoroughly reviewed recently ([Dubey, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijpara.2007.04.005)) and will be reiterated only briefly here.

*Toxoplasma gondii* has both asexual and sexual phases in its life-cycle but the sexual stages of the parasite only occur in the intestine of the definitive host, the cat and result in the excretion of oocysts in the faeces. Thus, one way that humans and other warm-blooded animals can be infected is by swallowing oocysts that contaminate food, water or the environment generally. Once ingested, sporozoites are released from the oocysts, penetrate the intestine, invade a range of different cell types and multiply asexually, and rapidly, as tachyzoites. The parasite disseminates to effectively all organs of the body via its ability to survive in macrophages and dendritic cells. Ultimately, immune pressure on the parasites results in the formation of cysts, containing slow growing bradyzoites. These cysts form particularly in the muscles, brain and CNS and can be harboured, asymptomatically, for life. Hence, a second means of transmission of *T. gondii* to humans is by the consumption of undercooked meat from a variety of animals that are susceptible to infection including sheep, pigs, cattle and poultry. Ingestion of the cysts releases the bradyzoites in the intestine and, like the sporozoites from oocysts they invade the intestine and revert to tachyzoites. Finally, *T. gondii* can also be transmitted from mother to developing foetus.

*Toxoplasma gondii* is a remarkably successful organism; around one-third of the world’s population is seropositive for this parasite. Seroprevalence increases with age and varies around the world ([Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2004.06.006)). Thus, in the USA, the overall seroprevalence is around 20–25% but in El Salvador, France or Brazil, for example, it may be as high as 75–80%. In the immunocompetent adult host, the acute phase of infection is normally asymptomatic and, as already mentioned cysts containing bradyzoites in tissues can be harboured, asymptomatically, for life. However, *T. gondii* can cause clinical disease, toxoplasmosis, with diverse manifestations, as thoroughly reviewed by Petersen and Liesenfeld recently ([Petersen and Liesenfeld, 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jaci.2007.04.041)). Pathology is very rare in healthy immunocompetent people, although there are significant numbers of cases of lymphadenopathy or ocular problems around the world every year. However, immunocompromised patients (e.g., AIDS patients or those undergoing immunosuppressive drug therapy for cancer or for organ transplantation) infected with *T. gondii* are at a high risk of developing fatal encephalitis due to the bradyzoites encysted in the brain reverting to tachyzoites and provoking a strong inflammatory response; it is well documented that up to 40% of AIDS patients are affected by toxoplasmic encephalitis, a disease with a high mortality rate if left untreated ([Kasper and Buzoni-Gatel, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0166-432X(98)00003-5)). Furthermore, if a primary infection with *T. gondii* occurs during pregnancy, it can lead to severe complications such as spontaneous abortion or congenital defects.

occurs during pregnancy, particularly during the first trimester, this may result in abortion, stillbirth or foetal abnormalities. The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis ranges from country to country; for example the incidence in France is possibly as high as 10 per 1000 (Desmonts and Couvreur, 1974) but only five per 10,000 in the UK (Williams et al., 1981) and one to 10 per 10,000 in the USA (Lopez et al., 2000). Furthermore, of congenitally infected babies without symptoms at birth, three-quarters will later develop severe mental retardation and/or hearing defects and as many as 90% will suffer eye problems as they grow older, which results in a huge drain on the public health system. A study of the economic burden caused by toxoplasmosis to individuals, families, the education and health systems has been done in the USA (Buzby and Roberts, 1996, 1997) and the estimated total cost of toxoplasmosis is around US$7 billion per year in the USA, covering costs associated with spontaneous abortion, birth defects (especially mental retardation, hearing defects and blindness), economic loss to families and individuals, special healthcare and education costs. Finally, it has also been estimated that *T. gondii* is the third leading cause of death due to food-borne pathogens in the USA (Mead et al., 1999). There is, therefore, a very strong case for believing that a vaccine against *T. gondii* for the entire population, but most particularly for females before they reach childbearing age, would be a valuable public health investment worldwide. Understanding the immunobiology of the innate immune response to this parasite is just one step on the road to such a vaccine.

## 2. Overview of the innate immune response to *T. gondii*

Underscoring the success of *T. gondii* is a delicate balance between the host immune response, which tries to clear the parasite, and the immune evasion strategies or immunomodulation elicited by the parasite, which enables the ultimate survival of both the parasite and the host. A tip of the balance in either direction is deleterious, as exemplified in AIDS patients, whereby the loss or decrease of a functioning immune system results in the uncontrolled replication of recrudesced parasites and the death of the host due to toxoplasmic encephalitis if not treated appropriately. A primary infection with *T. gondii* stimulates production of high levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ by cells of the innate immune system. The combined efforts of these two cytokines are central to resistance to *T. gondii* and ultimately elicit a very strong adaptive Th1-biased CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell-mediated immune response, which is also characterised by high levels of IL-12 and IFN-γ. The pro-inflammatory effects of these cytokines, including production of the microbicidal molecule, nitric oxide (NO) amongst others, are eventually dampened down by the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10, transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and IL-27.

### 2.1. IL-12 and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

IL-12 is a heterodimeric cytokine consisting of a heavy chain (p40) subunit that is shared with IL-23 and a covalently linked light chain (p35) subunit. It is produced by phagocytic cells such as monocytes, macrophages and neutrophils as well as antigen-presenting cells such as dendritic cells (DCs) in response to microbial stimuli and, in the case of phagocytes, other cytokines such as IFN-γ and granulocyte-macrophage-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) (Trinchieri and Gerosa, 1996). During *T. gondii* infection production of IL-12 is induced through the interactions of *T. gondii* antigens with CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) or Toll-like receptors (TLRs) triggering signalling pathways through the adaptor molecule MyD88 (myeloid differentiation primary-response protein 88) pathway (Aliberti, 2005) with both CCR5⁻/⁻ and MyD88⁻/⁻ mice displaying significant reductions in IL-12 production and increased susceptibility to infection (Aliberti et al., 2000; Scanga et al., 2002).

IL-12 is crucially important in the activation of natural killer (NK) cells to produce IFN-γ as well as driving the proliferation of type 1 CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells, which also produce IFN-γ (Reis e Sousa et al., 1997). Neutralisation of IL-12 in *T. gondii*-infected mice results in reduced production of IFN-γ and increased susceptibility to acute infection with mice succumbing due to overwhelming parasite proliferation (Gazzinelli et al., 1994). The IL-12p40 subunit appears to be the one that is critical for proper development of the Th1 immune response. IL-12p40⁻/⁻ mice are more susceptible to toxoplasmosis than IL-12p35⁻/⁻ mice although both are more susceptible than wild-type mice (Lieberman et al., 2004a). Although the p40 subunit is the subunit shared with IL-23, IL-12 rather than IL-23 is the cytokine required for resistance to *T. gondii*. IL-23p19⁻/⁻ mice infected with *T. gondii* developed normal T cell responses and were able to control parasite replication (Lieberman et al., 2004a). Macrophages, neutrophils and DCs all secrete IL-12 during acute *T. gondii* infection, though DCs seem to be the most important source (Reis e Sousa et al., 1997; Liu et al., 2006).

### 2.2. IFN-γ and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

Continuous IFN-γ production is necessary for control of both acute and chronic infection with *T. gondii* (Aliberti, 2005). NK and T cells, and antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and DCs have all been found to secrete IFN-γ (Suzue et al., 2003). IFN-γ plays a role in driving stage conversion from the rapidly dividing tachyzoite form found in acute infection to the bradyzoite stage found in chronic infection (Bohne et al., 1993) and suppresses conversion from bradyzoites to tachyzoites during chronic infection (Jones et al., 1986). IFN-γ knockout mice quickly succumb to infection despite an unimpaired IL-12 response, and mortality is associated with uncontrolled tachyzoite replication (Scharton-Kersten et al., 1996). Conversely, administration of anti-IFN-γ antibodies to chronically infected mice results in rapid reactivation of infection and subsequent mortality of infected hosts (Yap and Sher, 1999). The production of IFN-γ also activates macrophages to produce TNF which synergises with IFN-γ to initiate production of the microbicidal molecule, NO. There are a number of other effector mechanisms under the control of IFN-γ that have been reported to have roles in the control of *T. gondii*, including generation of reactive oxygen intermediates (ROI), iron deprivation, tryptophan starvation and activation of the p47 GTPases, as discussed below.

### 2.3. NO and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

NO is produced during the metabolism of L-arginine to citrulline by NO synthases (NOS) and is synthesised by many cells involved in the immune response such as macrophages, T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells, neutrophils and NK cells (Coleman, 2001). It is produced constitutively at low concentrations by NOS-1 and NOS-3 and has an important role in physiological processes acting as a vascular relaxing agent, a neurotransmitter and an inhibitor of platelet aggregation (Coleman, 2001). A third isoenzyme, inducible NOS (iNOS or NOS-2) is activated in response to cytokines such as IFN-γ, TNF and IL-1β to produce high concentrations of NO and this is the form commonly associated with the response to parasitic infection (Brunet, 2001). NO can directly kill tachyzoites of *T. gondii* by inhibiting essential mitochondrial and nuclear enzymes (Brunet, 2001).

NO production can be detrimental or beneficial to the host depending on the stage of *T. gondii* infection. In acute infection, excessive NO production contributes to increased pathology associated with inflammatory cytokines. Thus, mice treated with the

iNOS inhibitor, aminoguanidine or iNOS${}^{-/-}$ mice, which lack the capacity to produce NO, have increased parasite burdens but decreased intestinal and liver pathology and improved survival during acute infection. However, in the long-term, these mice develop severe necrotising lesions and uncontrolled tachyzoite replication in the CNS during chronic infection (Khan et al., 1997; Scharton-Kersten et al., 1997). NO is also known to be a factor in the stage conversion of *T. gondii* from the rapidly dividing tachyzoites stage to slowly dividing bradyzoites (Bohne et al., 1994) which “hide” within cysts inside various cells (including neuronal and muscle cells). Thus, it is possible that NO may also play an important part in holding the parasite in its dormant, chronic form.

The role of NO in controlling infection with *T. gondii* is not simple or clear-cut. Thus, there are significant differences in the requirement for NO between different strains of mice, C57BL/6, a highly susceptible mouse strain, requires NO to help combat the disease whereas BALB/c, a more resistant strain, do not (Schlüter et al., 1999). Kang et al. (2004) sought to dissect the basis behind this difference by examining the immune responses and parasite burden in these different strains following treatment with aminoguanidine. They showed that C57BL/6 mice infected with avirulent *T. gondii* and treated with aminoguanidine displayed even greater susceptibility than normal, correlating with decreased IFN-$\gamma$ and NO levels and increased brain parasite burdens. In contrast, BALB/c mice treated with aminoguanidine showed no difference in their susceptibility, cytokine production or parasite load compared with untreated animals. Apoptosis of splenocytes during the acute infection was not affected in either group indicating that, in this study, NO was not involved in inducing apoptosis (Kang et al., 2004). It is well known that susceptible strains of mice produce significantly more IFN-$\gamma$ than resistant mice (Lee and Kasper, 2004) and that this is associated with increased pathology associated with disease (Mordue et al., 2001). Why aminoguanidine treatment should cause a decrease in IFN-$\gamma$ production in these mice is unknown, but it implies that NO modulates IFN-$\gamma$ production.

### 2.4. Reactive oxygen intermediates and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

IFN-$\gamma$-activated production of ROI by macrophages has been recognised for many years as an important anti-microbial effector mechanism of the innate immune system. ROIs include the superoxide radical, hydrogen peroxide and the hydroxyl radical, unstable molecules that can react with, and damage, a range of crucial cell constituents. Superoxide anions can also react with NO to form the potent oxidising agent, peroxynitrite, leading to lipid peroxidation of cell membranes (Brunet, 2001). The importance of ROI in resistance to *T. gondii* has been the subject of some conjecture because, whilst ROI-mediated toxoplasmacidal activity has been demonstrated in human macrophages (Murray et al., 1985), the parasite has been reported to be quite resistant to ROI produced by murine macrophages (Chang and Pechere, 1989) and mice that lack an oxidative burst appear perfectly capable of controlling *T. gondii* in both the acute and chronic phases of infection (Scharton-Kersten et al., 1997).

### 2.5. Iron deprivation and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

Iron is a crucial cofactor in many metabolic processes in eukaryotic cells, with *T. gondii* being no exception. IFN-$\gamma$ has been demonstrated to limit the availability of iron within enterocytes infected with *T. gondii* and thereby inhibits replication of the parasite within these cells (Dimier and Bout, 1998; Bout et al., 1999). The mechanism for this is not well understood and it appears to be peculiar to enterocytes. Thus, it may be a

first line, innate protective response to intestinal infection with *T. gondii* (Suzuki et al., 2007).

### 2.6. Tryptophan starvation and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

Tryptophan is an essential amino acid for *T. gondii*, which it scavenges from host cells. IFN-$\gamma$-mediated induction of the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase pathway, which degrades tryptophan, effectively starves *T. gondii* of this amino acid, inhibiting its growth in a variety of cells in vitro, such as foetal fibroblasts, epithelial cells and endothelial cells of several species, including humans, mice and rats (Pfefferkorn, 1984; Pfefferkorn and Guyre, 1984; Pfefferkorn et al., 1986; Nagineni et al., 1996; Daubener and MacKenzie, 1999). Furthermore, the lungs and brains of mice infected with *T. gondii* show evidence of induction of the indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase pathway, with consequently low levels of tryptophan (Gazzinelli et al., 1993; Silva et al., 2002). Suzuki et al. (2007) speculate that tryptophan starvation may be a particularly important mechanism for limiting growth of *T. gondii* in the intestines during the early stages of infection and may also be important in limiting migration of the parasite across the placenta and into the foetus.

### 2.7. p47 GTPases and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

The p47 GTPases are a family of IFN-$\gamma$-inducible proteins of 47–48 kDa in size that possess GTPase activity and bind to subcellular membranes such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi bodies (Butcher et al., 2005a). There are at least six members in mice although only IGTP and LRG-47 are crucial for resistance to acute *T. gondii* infections in vivo. Thus, mice deficient in either IGTP or LRG-47 succumb to acute infection in a similar manner to IFN-$\gamma$-deficient mice (Collazo et al., 2001; Butcher et al., 2005a). Moreover, IFN-$\gamma$-dependent inhibition of *T. gondii* by macrophages is IGTP- and LRG-47-dependent (Butcher et al., 2005a). How these GTPases exert their protective effects is still poorly understood but it appears that membrane-bound forms mediate disruption and vesiculation of the parasitophorous vacuole leaving the ‘denuded’ parasite exposed in the cytosol. The parasite is subsequently surrounded by autophagosomes and lysed (Yap et al., 2006). In contrast to IGTP and LRG-47, IGP-47 (a third member of the family) is not important in resistance to acute infection with *T. gondii* and is not required in macrophage-mediated inhibition of the parasite but does play a role in control of the chronic phase of infection (Collazo et al., 2001; Butcher et al., 2005a).

### 2.8. Anti-inflammatory cytokines and innate resistance to *T. gondii*

A variety of IFN-$\gamma$-dependent pathways that can be called upon to limit acute infection with *T. gondii* underscore the importance of this cytokine in resistance to this highly successful parasite. However, although IFN-$\gamma$-dependent pro-inflammatory reactions are essential for resistance to *T. gondii* infection, an uncontrolled response leads to pathology. The host needs to balance the response to maximise pathogen clearance while minimising damage to itself (Shaw et al., 2006). The anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 plays a critical role in dampening down inflammatory responses to *T. gondii* infection. Thus, IL-10${}^{-/-}$ mice are unable to counteract the inflammatory effects of IFN-$\gamma$ and succumb during the acute stage of the disease with overwhelming pathology (Gazzinelli et al., 1996). Other anti-inflammatory cytokines involved in the regulation of immunopathology are TGF-$\beta$ and IL-27. TGF-$\beta$ secreted by intestinal epithelial lymphocytes is involved in the control of intestinal pathology following oral *T. gondii* infection (Mennechet et al., 2004) while IL-27 can suppress the production of cytokines from Th17 cells that promote immunopathology (Villarino et al., 2006).

## 3. Innate cellular defences against *T. gondii*

A number of different host cells and compartments are involved in the innate response to *T. gondii* and the interplay between these cells, particularly with regard to production of IL-12, IFN-γ, TNF, NO and other factors discussed above, is crucial to resistance to this parasite. *Toxoplasma gondii* is most commonly naturally acquired via oral ingestion of tissue cysts containing bradyzoites or oocysts harbouring sporozoites. Thus, the epithelial cells of the intestine provide the first line of defence against the parasite. However, despite the mechanisms in place in the intestine to control *T. gondii*, a number of parasites are still able to migrate across the epithelium via complex processes and disseminate to other cells, tissues and organs. *Toxoplasma gondii* can invade and survive quite well inside cells such as DCs and macrophages, and takes advantage of their migratory properties to disseminate around the body (Buzoni-Gatel et al., 2006). The migration of cells of the immune system from blood into the site of infection in peripheral tissues follows a tightly controlled series of events mediated by diffusible chemotactic factors and cell surface adhesion molecules. The acute inflammatory cellular infiltrate consists of cells such as neutrophils, DCs, macrophages, NK cells and NKT cells (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004), and all of these play a role in innate resistance to *T. gondii*.

### 3.1. The first line of defence against *T. gondii* is the intestinal epithelia

Following ingestion of tissue cysts or oocysts of *T. gondii*, bradyzoites or sporozoites are released in the small intestine and actively invade enterocytes. The infected cells then secrete cytotoxic molecules such as NO and also chemokines, in particular monocyte chemotactic protein (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1α (MIP-1a; CCL3) and MIP-1β (CCL4), which attract immune cells such as neutrophils, DCs, macrophages, monocytes and T cells (Mennechet et al., 2002). These cells, in turn, secrete cytokines such as IL-12, which stimulates the adaptive CD4 immune response. DCs in the lamina propria are responsible for capturing the parasite antigens and processing them for presentation to stimulate the T cells. CD4⁺ T cells in the lamina propria, in turn, synergise with infected enterocytes to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and TNF. IFN-γ activates macrophages, DCs and enterocytes to produce microbicidal molecules such as NO and clear the parasite (Buzoni-Gatel et al., 2006).

Enterocytes infected with *T. gondii* also produce IL-15, which initiates the immune response but, if left unregulated, results in pathogenesis. IL-15 targets NK and NKT cells, resulting in production of IFN-γ (Buzoni-Gatel et al., 2006). IL-15⁻/⁻ mice exhibit a milder inflammatory reaction to oral *T. gondii* and increased survival due to reduced gut pathology, despite increased parasite burden (Combe et al., 2006). Adoptive transfer of normal immune CD4⁺ T cells to IL-15⁻/⁻ mice results in an increased inflammatory response in recipient mice that leads to their death. The reduced CD4⁺ response seen in IL-15⁻/⁻ mice is due to a reduced ability of DCs to produce IL-12 and, subsequently, prime CD4⁺ cells (Combe et al., 2006). Furthermore, CD8⁺ T cell responses are abrogated, indicating that IL-15 also plays a role in the development of *T. gondii* antigen-specific memory CD8⁺ T cell response (Khan et al., 2002). This response is limited to oral infection however, as IL-15⁻/⁻ mice infected i.p. show similar mortality to *T. gondii* infection as wild-type mice (Lieberman et al., 2004b).

In susceptible mice such as C57BL/6J, peroral infection results in severe inflammation of the intestine, leading to ileitis and death of the host (Liesenfeld et al., 1999; Liesenfeld, 2002). This is associated with a dysregulation of the immune response including excessive IFN-γ and TNF production, hyper-activation of iNOS to produce large amounts of NO and production of CD4⁺αβ T cells (Liesenfeld, 2002). Both IL-12 and IL-18 play a role in the development of intestinal immunopathology following oral infection with *T. gondii* although IL-12 has the dominant role (Vossenkämper et al., 2004). Reduced expression of down-regulatory cytokines such as IL-10 and TGF-β also contribute to necrosis. Thus, IL-10⁻/⁻ mice on a resistant BALB/c background develop intestinal necrosis following *T. gondii* infection (Suzuki et al., 2000) as do resistant CBA mice treated with anti-TGF-β (Buzoni-Gatel et al., 2001).

Intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) also play important roles in both resistance to, and immunopathology of, intestinal toxoplasmosis. Secretion of MIP-1α and MIP-1β by enterocytes stimulates expression of the chemokine receptor CCR5, which results in migration of IEL. IEL are mainly CD8⁺ T cells and, in a *T. gondii* infection, antigen-primed IELs are cytotoxic for infected enterocytes. IELs are also capable of restricting the inflammatory response by producing the anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 and TGF-β (Kasper et al., 2004). Of these, TGF-β is vital in protection against ileitis, protection being afforded by TGF-β-mediated inhibition of IFN-γ production by intestinal CD4⁺ T cells. Primed IELs produce large amounts of TGF-β and inhibition of this abrogates the protective effect, causing the development of intestinal disease in resistant mouse strains (Kasper et al., 2004). Adoptive transfer of primed CD8⁺ IEL to naïve mice can provide long-term protection against orally acquired *T. gondii* infection, as shown by reduced mortality and brain cyst burden, which is dependent on endogenous IFN-γ (Lepage et al., 1998; Buzoni-Gatel et al., 1997). Furthermore, susceptible mouse strains can be protected against developing ileitis by administration of adenovirus expressing TGF-β (Buzoni-Gatel et al., 2001). In addition, mice deficient in γδ IELs exhibit accelerated onset of ileitis (Egan et al., 2005).

### 3.2. Neutrophils are recruited rapidly to the site of infection with *T. gondii*

Neutrophils are normally present in the bloodstream where they only survive for a few hours after being released from the bone marrow. They are the earliest phagocytic cells recruited and flood to the site of infection where they phagocytose and kill pathogens by the release of anti-microbial compounds from their granules and production of ROI and NO (van Gisbergen et al., 2005). As well as anti-microbial functions, neutrophils have an immunoregulatory function mediated by the release of a number of pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines that attract and stimulate other immune cells.

Following i.p. inoculation of tachyzoites, there is local recruitment of a large population of IL-12-positive neutrophils, whose influx is dependent on the chemokine receptors CXCR2 (Del Rio et al., 2001) and CCR1 (Khan et al., 2001). Thus, CCR1⁻/⁻ mice have defective neutrophil trafficking and proliferation and are more susceptible to *T. gondii* infection. This is associated with an increased tissue parasite burden and is independent of an effective T cell-mediated immune response being generated (Khan et al., 2001). In humans, CXCR2 together with CXCR1 are high affinity receptors for IL-8 that, along with growth-related oncogene-α (GRO-α), are important for recruitment of neutrophils. This leads to an influx of large numbers of cells to the site within 2–3 h where they secrete IL-12. The IL-12 can come from preformed stores or can be produced de novo (Bliss et al., 2000; Sukhumavasi et al., 2007).

Depletion of neutrophils early in infection results in increased susceptibility and exacerbation of toxoplasmosis, exemplified by a reversal of the Th1 response into a predominant Th2 response, whereas there is no effect if neutrophils are removed at later stages of infection, indicating a major role for those in the initial response to *T. gondii* (Bliss et al., 2001; van Gisbergen et al., 2005). Secretion of chemokines such as MIP-1α, MIP-1β, TNF, monokine induced by

IFN-γ (MIG), IFN-inducible protein-10 (IP-10) and IFN-inducible T cell α chemoattractant (I-TAC), which act on the cell surface receptors CCR5 and CXCR3 of Th1 cells but not chemokine receptors on Th2 cells, enables the neutrophils to support the immune response through the attraction of Th1 cells to the infection site (van Gisbergen et al., 2005).

Secretion of MIP-1α and MIP-1β, in addition to attracting T cells, also attracts monocytes, macrophages and immature DCs to the site of infection. Furthermore, neutrophils play an important role in DC maturation through direct cell contact and glycosylation-dependent interactions between neutrophil MAC-1 and DC-specific-ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN) expressed specifically on immature DCs. During these interactions, TNF produced by the neutrophil is passed along to the DC, triggering maturation of the DC (van Gisbergen et al., 2005; Sukhumavasi et al., 2007).

Further evidence for the importance of neutrophils in resistance to *T. gondii* comes from studies with mice that are deficient in the cytokine IL-17. IL-17 is the major cytokine responsible for neutrophil development and recruitment, and animals without the IL-17 gene are more susceptible to oral infection with *T. gondii* than parental C57BL/6J mice (Kelly et al., 2005). IL-17⁻/⁻ mice have approximately 100 times more parasites in the spleen, liver, gut and brain compared with wild-type mice, and tachyzoites are observed in the lamina propria of IL-17⁻/⁻ mice but not wild-type mice. Despite this, the wild-type animals exhibit more severe liver and gut pathology due to excessive IFN-γ production. IL-17⁻/⁻ animals develop a normal antigen-specific T cell immunity and NK cell response, but neutrophil and polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) recruitment to the peritoneal cavity following i.p. injection of *T. gondii* is significantly reduced. This is accompanied by a reduced level of macrophage inhibitory protein 2 (MIP-2) in IL-17⁻/⁻ mice, especially early on in infection (i.e., prior to day 4). Thus, during *T. gondii* infection, early neutrophil induction is dependent on IL-17 signalling, and the neutrophils eliminate a high proportion of the parasites during the initial stages. The result of defective IL-17 signalling is that the early burst of anti-*T. gondii* activity is absent, leading to the inability of the adaptive immune response to control the subsequent parasite burden it is faced with, resulting in increased mortality (Kelly et al., 2005).

### 3.3. Dendritic cells are crucial for early production of IL-12 in response to *T. gondii*

Maturation and activation of DCs in response to infection plays a major role in the initiation of innate immunity and the subsequent development of adaptive immunity. Maturation is described as the up-regulation of expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) and other co-stimulatory molecules that enhance the proliferation of naïve T cells, while activation is described as the production of inflammatory cytokines that regulate T cell differentiation (Kobayashi et al., 2003). In response to local signals, DCs bearing microbial antigens migrate from the site of infection to the spleen where they accumulate in the T cell areas and are responsible for much of the antigen-presenting activity in that organ, driving the polarisation of the Th response towards Th1 through the production of IL-12 (Reis e Sousa et al., 1997; Gubbels et al., 2005).

DCs are a major – probably the major – source of IL-12 produced in response to *T. gondii* and are vital for resistance against infection in vivo (Scott and Hunter, 2002). Depletion of DCs suppresses IL-12 production and increases susceptibility of mice to acute infection, while transfer of DCs from wild-type mice into DC-depleted mice prior to infection restores IL-12 and IFN-γ production, and increases resistance to infection (Liu et al., 2006). IL-12 production by DCs is rapid. Within a few hours of infection, most CD11⁺DCs present in the spleen have migrated from the red pulp and marginal zone to the T cell areas and are producing IL-12p40 (Aliberti et al., 2004). This IL-12 response exceeds that seen with other microbial-derived molecules that stimulate pro-inflammatory cytokine production, such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS), suggesting the use of a novel signalling pathway or multiple pathways stimulated by multiple ligands (discussed in more detail below).

One receptor that has been shown to be involved in DC mobilisation and IL-12 production following *T. gondii* infection is the chemokine receptor CCR5. During an infection, dendritic cells migrate into inflammatory sites in response to chemokines such as CCR5 ligands (CCL3, 4 and 5), secreted by neutrophils. Spleens from CCR5⁻/⁻ mice and mice treated with a CCR5 antagonist (Met-RANTES), showed an altered pattern of splenic DC mobilisation whereby DCs failed to congregate in T cell areas as they would normally do. CCR5⁻/⁻ animals also have greatly reduced DC IL-12 production in response to *T. gondii* compared with wild-type mice. These animals have higher parasite cyst numbers that correlate well with the lower levels of serum IL-12 and IFN-γ (Aliberti et al., 2000).

TLRs signalling through the adaptor protein MyD88 play an equally important role in the production of IL-12. DCs from MyD88⁻/⁻ mice show a significant reduction in IL-12 production in response to *T. gondii* tachyzoites or soluble tachyzoite antigen compared with DCs from wild-type mice (Scanga et al., 2002). This pathway is activated by the binding of a *T. gondii* profilin-like molecule to TLR11 (Yarovinsky et al., 2005). Both pathways seem to act in concert as treatment of MyD88⁻/⁻ mice with an agent that uncouples the G-protein signalling pathway utilised by CCR5 completely abolishes the residual IL-12 response seen in MyD88⁻/⁻ mice (Scanga et al., 2002).

Signals from the TNFR superfamily members such as CD40 also contribute to the regulation of DC activation (Kobayashi et al., 2003). CD40–CD40L interaction, in addition to microbial priming, is required by some human DCs to produce *T. gondii*-induced IL-12 (Subauste and Wessendarp, 2000) and this requirement for two signals is thought to guard against inappropriate IL-12 release (Denkers et al., 2004a). *Toxoplasma gondii* can also elicit DC IL-12 production in the absence of CD40 ligation. Thus, CD40L knockout mice are able to produce IL-12, albeit at a lower level than wild-type mice, and this is still sufficient to promote the IFN-γ required to survive the acute infection (Reichmann et al., 2000).

### 3.4. Macrophages play several roles in innate resistance to *T. gondii*

Macrophages are the most important phagocytic cells in the vertebrate body and play a pivotal role in the detection and elimination of pathogens. Together with DCs, they provide the first line of cell-mediated defence and are crucial in limiting the initial dissemination and/or growth of infectious organisms and in modulating the resulting immunological reactions (Stafford et al., 2002). Macrophage functions include production of cytokines, such as IL-12, and presentation of antigen to T cells through the MHC and co-stimulatory molecules that help trigger adaptive immune responses, as well as microbicidal effector mechanisms such as phagocytosis and phagolysosomal degradation, and production of ROI and NO (Butcher and Denkers, 2002; Stafford et al., 2002).

*Toxoplasma*-infected macrophages are, with DCs and neutrophils, an important source of IL-12 early in infection (Aliberti, 2005). This IL-12 acts on NK cells and, later, T cells, promoting production of IFN-γ, creating a positive feedback loop whereby IFN-γ promotes classical activation of macrophages. This classical activation plays a key role in the control of intracellular *T. gondii* infection, resulting in production of inflammatory cytokines and NO as part of a Th1 immune response. Two signals are required for this. First, IFN-γ, secreted by NK and/or T cells, primes the macrophage, then endogenous TNF, produced by the macrophage in response to pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs)

binding to pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) on the surface of
the macrophage, completes activation. Activated macrophages
then flood to the site of infection where they phagocytose and
destroy the microorganisms by release of lysosomal enzymes,
ROI and NO, as well as nutrient deprivation mechanisms (Stafford
et al., 2002; Mosser, 2003).

Apart from the production of inflammatory cytokines and NO,
exposure to IFN-γ and TNF also activates macrophage-mediated
mechanisms that restrict intracellular replication and promote
parasite clearance (Zhao et al., 2007). This is believed to be through
the process of autophagy where autophagosomes surround parts of
the cytosol or organelles. They then fuse with lysosomes to form
autolysosomes and their contents are subsequently degraded
(Andrade et al., 2006). *Toxoplasma gondii* resides within a parasit-
ophorous vacuole that ordinarily resists fusion with the lysosomal
compartment of the cell, however, entry of the parasite into an
activated macrophage can result in disruption of the parasitopho-
rous vacuole membrane and autophagolysosomal elimination of the
parasite (Yap et al., 2007). This is mediated through two separate
pathways, one involving IFN-γ-dependent activation of p47 GTPases
(described above) and the other, an IFN-γ-independent pathway,
involving CD40 ligation and autocrine TNF signalling (Yap
et al., 2007). CD40 ligation recruits the signalling molecule, TRAF6
(discussed in more detail below), and enhances TNF production. It
also signals downstream of this to recruit autophagosomes to the
parasitophorous vacuole in a process dependent on the autophago-
some proteins, Beclin 1 and class III P13 kinase. The lysosomal pro-
tein, Rab7, controls the subsequent fusion of autophagosomes and
lysosomes (Subauste et al., 2007). Thus, although IFN-γ is central
for resistance to *T. gondii*, it appears that this CD40-dependent
pathway provides an additional mechanism of host protection
(Andrade et al., 2006).

Over-production of inflammatory cytokines and NO can result
in serious immunopathology and so the activity of these cells
needs to be tightly regulated. Signals from the macrophages them-
selves or surrounding cells down-regulate macrophage activation
and result in the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines such
as IL-10 and TGF-β (Mosser, 2003). Knockout mice lacking either
of these two cytokines are more susceptible to inflammatory
pathologies than wild-type mice (Mosser, 2003). The stem cell-de-
rived tyrosine kinase/recepteur d’origine (STK/RON) receptor is
also involved in the inhibition of classical activation (Mosser,
2003). Binding of its ligand, macrophage-stimulating protein
(MSP), triggers a sequence of events that results in down-regula-
tion of IL-12 production and inhibition of NO production (Morrison
and Correll, 2002; Morrison et al., 2004). The removal of infected or
inflammatory cells undergoing apoptosis by macrophage phagocy-
tosis also plays an important role in the resolution of inflammation
as well as promoting TGF-β production (Zhang and Mosser, 2008).

### 3.5. Natural Killer cells are the early source of IFN-γ in response to *T. gondii*

NK cells are lymphocytes of the innate immune response that
contribute to early resistance to *T. gondii* (French et al., 2006;
Goldszmid et al., 2007). NK cells recognise and kill infected cells
and, most importantly, are the major source of IFN-γ early in infec-
tion (French et al., 2006). NK cell activity is increased in *T. gondii-*
infected mice (Hunter et al., 1994). NK cell cytotoxicity is up-regu-
lated by IL-18 from macrophages and DCs, and proliferation in-
creases through the combined actions of IL-18 and IL-15 (French
et al., 2006). The cells are produced in bone marrow and circulate
in the blood. After infection they traffic to the lymph node and then
into the site of infection where they release IFN-γ to classically
activate macrophages and increase MHC Class II expression (Khan
et al., 2006). NK cells possess a number of chemokine receptors
that facilitate this process, the most important of which seems to
be CCR5. Decreased NK cell trafficking to the site of infection is
seen in *T. gondii*-infected CCR5⁻/⁻ mice. Although this leads to a de-
creased inflammatory response in response to infection, the CCR5⁻/
⁻ mice eventually succumb due to increased parasitaemia (Khan
et al., 2006).

IFN-γ production by NK cells is stimulated by IL-12 produced by
neutrophils, macrophages and DCs (French et al., 2006). In partic-
ular, direct interactions between DCs and NK cells augment pro-
duction of IFN-γ by NK cells as well as increasing IL-12
production by DCs (Guan et al., 2007). This is mediated through
the NKG2D receptor on the NK cell binding to ligands on the sur-
face of the DC. These ligands are poorly expressed by normal cells
but are up-regulated in infected cells. Neutralising the NKG2D
receptor with antibodies results in decreased IFN-γ production
(Guan et al., 2007). NK cells also have an important role in priming
the adaptive immune response. Thus, neutralising the NKG2D
receptor or depleting NK cells results in reductions in both the
CD4⁺ T cell and CD8⁺ T cell responses (Combe et al., 2005; Guan
et al., 2007).

## 4. Initiation of the innate immune response to *T. gondii* through
signalling pathways

Activation of the various cells of the innate immune system is
initiated through recognition of specific structures or ligands on
the surface of the infecting parasite (Kawai and Akira, 2005). These
PAMPs have three key features: (i) they are not expressed by host
cells; (ii) they are highly conserved and (iii) their expression is
essential for microbial survival (Gazzinelli and Denkers, 2006).
Binding of the PAMPs by PRRs on the surface of immune cells trig-
gers intracellular signalling pathways that result in the induction
of the immune response (Kawai and Akira, 2005). Receptors
include TLRs, scavenger receptors and C-type lectins, with TLRs
playing a central role (Yarovinsky and Sher, 2006), especially with
regard to the critical initiation of IL-12 production, upon which
subsequent production of IFN-γ and classical activation of macro-
phages rests.

### 4.1. Toll-like receptors, MyD88 and innate immune responses to *T. gondii*

TLRs are crucial for the recognition of intracellular pathogens.
All TLRs have amino-terminal leucine-rich repeats that recognise
PAMPs, and a carboxy-terminal Toll-interleukin 1 receptor (TIR)
domain that initiates intracellular signalling (Kawai and Akira,
2005). Most species have 10–15 TLRs that differ in ligand specific-
ity, expression patterns and the signal transduction pathways acti-
vated (Iwasaki and Medzhitov, 2004). Different immune cells and
different subsets of cells express different repertoires of TLRs that
can result in different outcomes even with the same ligand (Iwasa-
ki and Medzhitov, 2004).

Binding of a ligand to its TLR typically stimulates pro-inflamma-
tory activity, which protects the host from pathogen invasion. A
typical example of this is the activation of TLR4 by LPS from
Gram-negative bacteria, resulting in the rapid induction of an in-
tense inflammatory response (Beutler, 2000). Following binding
to PAMPs, the TLR associates with an adaptor protein. All TLRs,
with the exception of TLR3, associate with the adaptor protein,
myeloid differentiation primary-response protein (MyD88). TLR3
associates with TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing
IFN-β (TRIF or TICAM-1). TLR4, in addition to its association with
MyD88, can also associate with TRIF, TRIF-related adaptor mole-
cule (TRAM or TICAM-2) and TIR domain-containing adaptor pro-
tein (TIRAP or MAL). TLRs 1, 2 and 6 can also associate with
TIRAP (Fig. 1; Akira and Takeda, 2004).

Transcription of inflammatory cytokines  

Fig. 1. Toll-like receptor (TLR) signalling pathways. After binding a pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) the TLR associates with adaptor proteins containing a Toll/IL-1 receptor (TIR) domain such as TIR-associated protein (TIRAP), myeloid differentiation marker 88 (MyD88), TIR-domain-containing adaptor protein inducing IFN-β (TRIF) and TRIF-related adaptor molecule (TRAM). Different TLRs associate with different combinations of adaptor proteins giving them distinctive responses. The TLR/MyD88 complex recruits members of the IL-1 receptor-associated (IRAK) family, IRAK4 and IRAK1. All signals then converge on TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6). TRAF6 then associates with transforming growth factor (TGF)-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) and TAB2. Activated TAK1 initiates NFκB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. In the NFκB pathway inhibitor of kappa kinases (IKKs) phosphorylate IκB releasing NFκB, which translocates to the nucleus and induces the expression of its target genes. The MAPK pathway results in the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK which in turn leads to the activation of transcription factors such as c-Jun and ultimately leads to the expression of inflammatory cytokines.

Once formed, the TLR/adaptor complex recruits members of the IL-1-receptor-associated kinase (IRAK) family. Phosphorylation of the IRAKs leads to association with TRAF6 followed by dissociation from the TLR/adaptor protein complex and association with TGF-β-activated kinase 1 (TAK1), TAK1 binding protein 1 (TAB1) and TAB2 (Akira and Takeda, 2004). The TRAF6/TAK1/TAB1/TAB2 complex subsequently translocates to the cytoplasm where activated TAK1 initiates NF-κB and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways (discussed in more detail below). Activation of both of these pathways results in the production of the inflammatory cytokines and chemokines associated with the response to infection with an intracellular pathogen (Fig. 1).

The most compelling reason to believe that TLRs are important in innate resistance to *T. gondii* is the fact that MyD88⁻/⁻ mice are as acutely susceptible as IL-12⁻/⁻ mice to infection with avirulent strains of the parasite (Scanga et al., 2002). Multiple TLRs seem to be simultaneously involved in resistance rather than a single TLR as studies using TLR1⁻/⁻, TLR2⁻/⁻, TLR4⁻/⁻, TLR2/4⁻/⁻, TLR6⁻/⁻, TLR9⁻/⁻ and TLR11⁻/⁻ mice generally found no increase in susceptibility to *T. gondii* compared with wild-type mice (Scanga et al., 2002; Mun et al., 2003; Hitziger et al., 2005; Yarovinsky et al., 2005; Minns et al., 2006; Debierre-Grockiego et al., 2007). Mun et al. (2003) did find increased susceptibility of TLR2⁻/⁻ mice to *T. gondii* infection but only with a high dose. An increase in parasite burden was noted for TLR2/4⁻/⁻, TLR9⁻/⁻ and TLR11⁻/⁻ mice but only TLR9⁻/⁻ and TLR11⁻/⁻ mice displayed a deficiency in IFN-γ production. TLR11⁻/⁻ mice were also deficient in IL-12 but this was not examined in TLR9⁻/⁻ mice (Yarovinsky et al., 2005; Minns et al., 2006; Debierre-Grockiego et al., 2007). The only other signalling pathways that are dependent on MyD88 are those mediated through the IL-1 and IL-18 receptors, neither of which can be confidently assigned a critical role in innate resistance to *T. gondii* (Vossenkämper et al., 2004; Hitziger et al., 2005; Roberts et al., 2007). In addition to increased parasitaemia, MyD88⁻/⁻ mice showed starkly reduced IL-12 production by macrophages, neutrophils and dendritic cells (Scanga et al., 2002). Intriguingly, the reduction in IL-12 production seen in MyD88⁻/⁻ DCs, although significant, was not as great as the reduction seen in MyD88⁻/⁻ macrophages and neutrophils, indicating the involvement of another pathway in IL-12 production by DCs (Scanga et al., 2004). Thus, signalling through TLRs is clearly important in innate resistance to *T. gondii* but it appears that more than one TLR is involved in the response, implying that more than one PAMP from *T. gondii* is responsible for activating the innate immune response.

conjecture is in keeping with the fact that the IL-12 response to *T.* gondii exceeds that seen in response to many other microbial pathogens.

To date, only a few *T.* gondii molecules that bind to TLRs have been identified and studied: profilin, which is thought to bind to actin and be involved in parasite motility and host cell invasion (Plattner et al., 2008) and has been shown to bind to TLR11 in mice (Yarovinsky et al., 2005); glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored proteins (GPIs) located on the surface of the parasite have been shown to be TLR2 and TLR4 ligands (Debierre-Grockiego et al., 2007); and *T.* gondii heat shock protein 70 (TgHSP70), which induces NF-κB promoter activity through a MyD88-dependent pathway transduced via TLR2 and TLR4 (Aosai et al., 2002). Interestingly, TgHSP70 induces proliferation of splenic B cells from TLR2 knockout mice and MyD88 knockout mice but not from TLR4 knockout mice, indicating that TLR4 is involved in the TgHSP70-induced proliferation of B cells (Aosai et al., 2002). TgHSP70 also induces tolerance to NO production upon subsequent exposure in peripheral monocytes, and this is mediated via TLR4. It is postulated that TgHSP70-induced release of NO is mediated via the TLR2/MyD88 signal transduction pathway, which also stimulates the expression and activation of SOCS-1, and that prior exposure to TgHSP70 induces a tolerance to NO production via TLR4 (Mun et al., 2005).

### 4.2. MAPK signalling and innate immune responses to *T.* gondii

MAPKs are a family of protein kinases that include extracellular signal-related kinases (Erks), p38 MAPK and stress-activated protein kinase/c-Jun N-terminal kinase (SAPK/JNK). Activation of the MAPK signalling pathway is initiated via binding of TLRs to a microbial pathogen, with resultant activation of TAK1, as described above (Denkers et al., 2004b). MAPKs, in turn, cause activation of transcription factors such as NF-IL-6, Elk-1, activating transcription factor-2 (ATF-2), cyclic adenosine monophosphate-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Jun, ultimately resulting in the production of IL-12 and TNF (Denkers et al., 2004b).

IL-12 production in macrophages in response to *T.* gondii is dependent on the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK (Mason et al., 2004a). Phosphorylation can be through TRAF6 (Mason et al., 2004a) or can be as a result of *T.* gondii directly inducing autophosphorylation through an association with TAB1 (Kim et al., 2005). Intriguingly, the signalling pathways utilised for p38 activation are influenced by the genotype of the infecting *T.* gondii with avirulent strains such as Me49 activating both MyD88-dependent and independent pathways whereas virulent strains such as RH stimulate only MyD88-independent pathways (Kim et al., 2006). That avirulent strains induce production of much more IL-12 than do virulent strains of *T.* gondii has been known for several years (e.g., Robben et al., 2004), and the stimulation of two separate pathways leading to IL-12 production by avirulent strains versus a single pathway stimulated by virulent *T.* gondii could, at least partly, explain this. The components of the MyD88-independent pathway are yet to be elucidated.

The MAPK pathway is also important in neutrophil responses to *T.* gondii. Thus, IL-12 and MCP-1 production in neutrophils is dependent on the expression of the MAPK family member, JNK2 (Sukhumavasi et al., 2007). MCP-1 production is dependent on TLR2 signalling through the MyD88 pathway whereas neutrophil IL-12 is triggered through an as yet unidentified MyD88-dependent TLR (Del Rio et al., 2004).

### 4.3. NFκB signalling and innate immune responses to *T.* gondii

NFκB proteins, or Rel proteins as they are alternatively known, are composed of a family of molecules named NFκB1 (p50), NFκB2 (p52), RelA (p65), RelB and c-Rel (Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000; Mason et al., 2002). These molecules form homo- and heterodimers but only RelA and c-Rel contain transcriptional activation domains. Various cytokines and anti-apoptotic genes are regulated by NF-κB including IL-12, TNF, iNOS, cFLIP, Bcl-2 and Bcl-xl. NF-κB is constitutively expressed and maintained in an inactive state in the cytoplasm of macrophages in association with the IκB, an inhibitor that blocks the nuclear translocation sequence. Upon appropriate stimulation, activation of TAK1 leads to the activation of Iκ kinase-α (IKKα) and IKK-β, which results in phosphorylation and subsequent targeted ubiquitin-dependent degradation of IκB. This reveals the NFκB nuclear localisation sequences that then direct NFκB for nuclear translocation and subsequent transcription of several innate immune system genes.

Gene knockout studies have revealed important roles for various members of the NFκB family, indicating their importance in innate and acquired immunity to *T.* gondii. Thus, RelB knockout mice succumb during early infection, whereas c-Rel knockout and p52 knockout animals succumb later in infection due to toxoplasmic encephalitis (Caamaño et al., 1999, 2000; Mason et al., 2004b). Surprisingly however, these mice are able to produce normal levels of IL-12, indicating that these hosts also have NFκB-independent pathways of IL-12 production that may represent a back-up mechanism in response to infections with pathogens like *T.* gondii, which actively inhibit NFκB activation as described below (Caamaño et al., 1999; Mason et al., 2002).

### 4.4. Other signalling pathways and the innate immune response to *T.* gondii

There is evidence that other signalling pathways also have a role in innate resistance to *T.* gondii. One hint that MyD88- and NFκB-independent pathways may be important stems from the observation that IL-12 production by DCs is not totally abrogated in MyD88⁻/⁻ mice but treatment of these mice with pertussis toxin, an uncoupler of G-protein signalling, completely abolishes IL-12 production by DCs, indicating that a G-protein coupled pathway also plays a role in the IL-12 response (Scanga et al., 2002). A likely scenario is that, following infection, parasite antigens bind to CCR5 triggering IL-12 production through a G-protein signalling pathway. The *T.* gondii molecule, cyclophilin 18 (C-18), has been identified as a CCR5 ligand. Dendritic cells from CCR5⁻/⁻ mice do not respond to purified C-18, whilst MyD88⁻/⁻ dendritic cells produce appreciable amounts of IL-12 in response to C-18. However, purified C-18 is also less potent in stimulating IL-12 production than whole parasite extracts so it is unlikely to be the only parasite molecule involved in stimulating a response (Aliberti et al., 2003). Precisely how the MyD88-dependent and independent pathways interact is still being elucidated but Aliberti et al. (2004) have proposed a model whereby *T.* gondii C-18-TLR ligand complexes induce TLR-CCR5 membrane clustering in DCs. This enhances IL-12 production by either providing a physical platform for the accumulation of enough TLRs to generate enough signal strength to allow gene transcription or by providing a G-protein coupled signal that intersects with the MyD88 pathway and subsequently enhances IL-12 production (Aliberti et al., 2004).

The Janus kinase (JAK)/signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) signalling pathway may also play a part in the induction of innate immune responses to *T.* gondii. Many of the effects of IFN-γ on macrophages are mediated through STAT-1, which is activated when IFN-γ binds to its receptor, triggering a series of phosphorylations that activate JAKs and IFN-γ receptor 1 and, ultimately, STAT-1 (Gavrilescu et al., 2004). Activated STAT-1 dimerises and translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the promoter regions of IFN-γ-inducible genes such as iNOS and p47 GTPases. STAT-1⁻/⁻ mice fail to up-regulate these genes
in response to *T. gondii* infection and show increased susceptibility (Gavrilescu et al., 2004).

### 5. Immunomodulation: the balancing act between *T. gondii* and its host for mutually assured survival

Toxoplasma is a master at infiltrating into deep tissues and crossing biological barriers and can therefore enter into immunoprivileged sites such as the brain, placenta and retina (Hunter and Remington, 1994). Whilst *T. gondii* induces the increased expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) on trophoblasts and endothelial cells to aid invasion, it has also been shown that the parasite can down-regulate adhesion molecule expression on macrophages during the first 24 h following infection but this returns to normal after 48 h. This causes the infected cells to remain in circulation for longer than normal and it is hypothesised that this allows the parasite to utilise infected macrophages and dendritic cells to deliver them to distal sites, where they can then access such immunoprivileged sites (Da Gama et al., 2004). Importantly, the most severe forms of the disease occur as a result of the parasite accessing these sites, including congenital toxoplasmosis, ocular problems (Klaren and Kijlstra, 2002), severe neurological complications and encephalitis in immunocompromised individuals (Luft et al., 1993).

Over and above the occupation of immunoprivileged sites, *T. gondii* interferes with many arms of the innate immune system to ensure an environment suitable for sustained parasite growth in the absence of severe pathology. *Toxoplasma gondii* is remarkably able to control its own fate via modulation of many of the intricate pathways described above that the host uses to try to kill it.

#### 5.1. Toxoplasma gondii-mediated dendritic cell paralysis

Priming of DCs in vivo with soluble tachyzoite antigen (STAg) renders them completely unresponsive to subsequent exposure to *T. gondii* – a phenomenon termed dendritic cell paralysis (Reis e Sousa et al., 1999). IL-10⁻/⁻ animals whose DCs are paralysed in this manner are protected against immunopathology upon subsequent infection with tachyzoites, and it is thought that this is an immune control mechanism instigated by *T. gondii* to avoid overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

The DC paralysis lasts for about a week and the basis for it has been shown to be parasite-induced production of an eicosanoid known as lipoxin A₄ (LXA₄;) (Aliberti, 2005). During *T. gondii* infection, serum levels of LXA₄ increase progressively during the acute phase of the disease and remain elevated throughout the chronic phase (Aliberti et al., 2002). Lipoxins exhibit potent anti-inflammatory properties in a range of diseases and are produced as a result of many metabolic pathways catalysed by lipoxygenases (including 5-LO and 15-LO). They exert their activity by binding to a variety of G-protein-coupled receptors including FPRL-1. In vivo injection of STAg results in the up-regulation of LXA₄ secretion in mouse spleens within 6 h and this response is not seen in 5-LO⁻/⁻ mice. In addition, DC paralysis is not induced in 5-LO knockout animals. Furthermore, addition of LXA₄ to DC cultures inhibits STAg-induced DC migration and IL-12 production (Aliberti et al., 2002).

Mice that are 5-LO-deficient succumb to *T. gondii* infection during the early stages of chronic disease due to an excessive inflammatory response. Thus, 5-LO⁻/⁻ mice, although harbouring greatly reduced brain cyst burdens, experience extensive tissue pathology and massive cerebral infiltration leading to atypical meningitis (Aliberti et al., 2002). Treatment of 5-LO⁻/⁻ mice with lipoxin analogues results in resistance to tissue pathology, reduced inflammatory responses and no mortality, indicating that lipoxins, in particular LXA₄, are involved in inhibiting the onset of tissue infiltration. LXA₄ has a different mode of action to IL-10, as administration of IL-10 to 5-LO⁻/⁻ mice failed to protect these animals (Aliberti, 2005). Hence, the anti-inflammatory actions of IL-10 and LXA₄ provide independent strategies for controlling pro-inflammatory activity.

STAg-induced paralysis of DCs is associated with CCR5 levels and is linked to the production of LXA₄. It has been hypothesised that parasite infection induces endogenous production of LXA₄, which binds to FRPL-1 on DCs and this subsequently down-regulates CCR5 and other chemokine receptors, resulting in reduced IL-12 production (Aliberti and Sher, 2002). The molecular mechanism behind the lipoxin-mediated anti-inflammatory responses is believed to involve suppressors of cytokine signalling (SOCS) molecules. This family of protein includes SOCS-1 to SOCS-7 and cytokine inducible Src homology 2 domain-containing protein (CIS). They mediate their actions by binding to the intracellular domains of cytokine receptors, thereby functioning as intracellular, inducible feedback inhibitors of cytokine receptor signalling (Alexander and Hilton, 2004). They can also mediate the ubiquitination and degradation of the bound molecules through the association of a motif found in all SOCS proteins, termed the SOCS box, with Elongin B and C, cullin-2 and Rbx1, (Dalpe et al., 2008). Binding of LXA₄ to FRPL-1 and another DC receptor, AhR, triggers expression of SOCS-2. SOCS-2 helps to control responses to microbial stimuli as SOCS-2-deficient mice infected with *T. gondii* show increased mortality associated with an excessive pro-inflammatory response (Machado et al., 2006). SOCS-2 interacts with the intracellular signalling molecules, TRAF2 and TRAF6, mediating their ubiquitinylation and proteasome-dependent degradation. This disrupts activation of the JNK and NFκB signalling pathways leading to inhibition of pro-inflammatory cytokine production (Machado et al., 2008).

Parasite regulation of this lipoxin-dependent regulatory pathway would be beneficial to the organism as it would dampen down the inflammatory immune response, enabling the host to control but not eliminate parasite proliferation, whilst reducing the devastating effects of excessive inflammation or tissue destruction. Recent evidence indicates that *T. gondii* itself possesses 15-LO activity (Bannenberg et al., 2004). The synthesis of leukotriene A₄ from arachidonic acid is catalysed by 5-LO and this is subsequently rapidly converted to LXA₄ by 15-lipoxygenase. The gene for 15-LO has not been formally identified in *T. gondii* but proteomic analysis of tachyzoite lysates revealed peptides homologous to plant-derived type I lipoxygenases and 15-LO enzymatic activity has been observed in tachyzoites exposed to a calcium ionophore (Bannenberg et al., 2004). In the host, expression of 5-LO is up-regulated in splenic macrophages in response to *T. gondii* infection, although the trigger remains unknown. Interestingly, *T. gondii* does not possess lipids that could serve as a substrate for 15-LO, further implicating this enzyme in immune modulation rather than normal parasite metabolism (Aliberti and Bafica, 2005).

#### 5.2. Toxoplasma gondii subverts the NFκB signalling cascade and interferes with MAPK activation

There is plenty of evidence that suggests that *T. gondii* subverts the NFκB signalling cascade, particularly early in infection. Macrophages infected with the virulent RH strain of *Toxoplasma* show no nuclear translocation of either RelA or c-Rel, even when subsequently triggered by LPS (Butcher et al., 2001; Shapira et al., 2002). This results in a transient block in IL-12 production in these cells and an almost complete, sustained block in TNF production (Butcher and Denkers, 2002). It appears as though the parasite directly blocks the NFκB signalling pathway, as these responses
are only seen in infected cells in the presence of live parasites. Interestingly, *T. gondii* itself triggers the phosphorylative degradation of cytoplasmic IkB, but this does not result in nuclear translocation of NFκB (Butcher et al., 2001).

One candidate parasite molecule for modulation of NFκB activity is TgHSP70, which has been implicated in blocking NFκB function/translocation (Dobbin et al., 2002). Mammalian HSP70 is able to block NFκB activation. It does this by either interacting with the NFκB:IκB complex after the initial dissociation of NFκB in its role as a molecular chaperone or could inhibit the activity of the 20s proteasome responsible for degrading IκB. HSP70 possesses a nuclear translocation signal and may therefore compete with NFκB for access to nucleopore complexes (Feinstein et al., 1997). Importantly, in its role in immunosuppression of host Th1 immune responses and putative up-regulation of Th2 responses, TgHSP70 has been shown to increase susceptibility to infection with *T. gondii* (Ahmed et al., 2004). Additionally, *T. gondii* infection leads to reduced phosphorylation of p65 resulting in the inability of NFκB to translocate to the nucleus (Shapira et al., 2005). The transient nature of the blockade of this signalling pathway, which lasts for approximately 6 h p.i. (Kim et al., 2004), is likely to be yet another way in which the parasite enables itself to establish an infection within macrophages without overwhelming the host.

Studies undertaken in other cell types have shown that the inhibition of NFκB translocation is not a universal response to infection with *T. gondii*. Thus murine embryonic fibroblasts do undergo p50 and p65 nuclear translocation during infection, and activation of NFκB is associated with induction of anti-apoptotic genes (Payne et al., 2003; Molestina et al., 2003). Furthermore, host IκB was found to be concentrated around the parasitophorous vacuole in these infected cells, prompting the investigators to propose that *T. gondii* may actively hijack the NFκB signalling pathway, although this has subsequently been disproved (Molestina and Sinai, 2005). Instead, a parasite IκB kinase was discovered in extracellular parasite extracts and parasitophorous vacuole membrane (PVM) fractions, indicating that *T. gondii* manipulates the NFκB pathway via a novel method. Thus, it appears that *T. gondii* is able to subvert the NFκB signalling pathway in a number of ways, all of which results in a delay of the host immune response in order to promote initiation and propagation of the disease.

The blockade of NFκB translocation in macrophages during early infection does not account for all the *T. gondii*-mediated effects seen and does not entirely abrogate IL-12 production. It is now apparent that this parasite also interferes with the MAPK signalling pathway. As mentioned above, this pathway is triggered by TAK1 and is vital in varied aspects of the immune response. Live tachyzoite infection of macrophages results in rapid activation of Erk1/2, SAPK/JNK and p38 MAPK, followed immediately by deactivation of each (Valère et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2004). When cells are subsequently restimulated via TLR4 with LPS, there is defective MAPK activation, resembling that seen in endotoxin tolerance although the mechanisms are distinct (Kim et al., 2004). In addition, TRAF6 knockout mice and macrophages stimulated with STAg fail to produce IL-12, whereas wild-type mice and macrophages undergo rapid TRAF6-dependent phosphorylation of p38 and Erk1/2, which differentially regulates the production of IL-12 in response to STAg (Mason et al., 2004b). In short, present data indicates that *T. gondii* targets p38 MAPK for inactivation via currently unknown mechanisms, but possibly via hijacking the regulatory action of host phosphatases (Denkers and Butcher, 2005).

### 5.3. Toxoplasma gondii disrupts IFN-γ signalling

The production of IFN-γ during the innate immune response is critical for resistance to the parasite. It exerts its effects by binding to the IFN-γ receptor present on the surface of many cells and activating, via the JAK/STAT pathway, the transcription of genes involved in a range of processes including anti-microbial activity and the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines (Kim et al., 2007). A number of studies have shown that *T. gondii* is able to disrupt the expression of a number of genes induced by IFN-γ by interfering with the transcriptional activity of STAT-1 (Lang et al., 2006; Zimmermann et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2007), however, there are conflicting reports as to how the parasite achieves this. SOCS-1 is one of the proteins induced by the binding of IFN-γ and is known to negatively regulate JAK/STAT signal transduction to help prevent the over-production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Zimmermann et al. (2006) found an over-expression of SOCS-1 in response to infection although SOCS-1 induction was only seen in infected cells and relied on direct contact with live parasites. They also found infection inhibited IFN-γ-induced STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation as well as IFN-γ-mediated activation of iNOS (Zimmermann et al., 2006). Conversely, Kim et al. (2007) found no induction of SOCS-1 following infection of cells nor any inhibition of STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and trafficking to the nucleus. However, the expression of IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1), a process normally under the control of STAT-1, was inhibited in infected cells indicating that, in this study, the parasite may be interfering with STAT-1 transcriptional activity in the nucleus (Kim et al., 2007). Lang et al. (2006) also observed normal STAT-1 tyrosine phosphorylation and translocation to the nucleus but down-regulation of IRF-1 in infected cells. Different parasite strains were used in these studies and that may help to explain the differences seen. Saeij et al. (2007) have shown that one of the rhoptry proteins (ROP16) released by *T. gondii* as it invades is a putative protein kinase that seems to affect STAT-1 signalling pathways. The protein is polymorphic and strain-specific differences in the modulation of host cell transcription were observed (Saeij et al., 2007).

#### 5.4. Toxoplasma gondii hijacks STAT3 signalling

The IL-10/STAT3 signalling cascade is a crucial pathway involved in controlling pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-12 and TNF. Recruitment and phosphorylation of STAT3 occurs following activation of Jak1 or Tyk2 by ligation with IL-10R and is an essential event for the immunosuppressive activity of IL-10 (Williams et al., 2004a,b). Infection of mouse macrophages by live *T. gondii* is accompanied by rapid activation of STAT3, by an as yet unknown mechanism that is MyD88-independent (Dunn et al., 2007); thus, the parasite effectively hijacks the pathway that mediates the anti-inflammatory effects of IL-10 (Butcher et al., 2005b). STAT3 is also known to be important in *T. gondii*-induced suppression of LPS-triggered cytokine responses, indicating yet another way in which the parasite exerts its dominance over the host immune response.

### 6. Toxoplasma gondii affects the outcome of other infections

Given the immunomodulatory abilities of *T. gondii*, coupled with the extremely potent Th1 response provoked by this parasite, it is perhaps not surprising that it has the capacity to modulate the immune response to several other pathogens of diverse phylogeny. For example, *T. gondii* is able to down-regulate responses to the nematode parasite, *Nippostrongylus brasiliensis*, even after the worm infection is well established (Liesenfeld et al., 2004). *Toxoplasma gondii* also alters the course of *Helicobacter felis* infection, converting a normally resistant host to a susceptible one. *Toxoplasma gondii* infection increases *H. felis*-specific Th1 responses and decreases *H. felis*-specific Th2 responses (Stoicov et al.,
2004); gastric mucosal IFN-γ and IL-12 are increased and IL-10 decreased in co-infected mice, leading to severe gastric mucosal inflammation. Acute *T. gondii* infection also converts a *Leishmania major*-susceptible host to a resistant one. IFN-γ production is increased and IL-4 production suppressed, resulting in the suppression of lesion formation and reduced parasite burden in co-infected mice (Santiago et al., 1999). Such immunomodulation may well alter the outcome of infection; as noted by Liesenfeld et al. (2004), earlier co-infection studies with *T. gondii* established this parasite’s ability to alter the outcome of bacterial (Ruskin and Remington, 1968), viral (Remington and Merigan, 1969), fungal (Gentry and Remington, 1971), protozoal (Mengs and Pelster, 1982) and helminth infections (Mahmoud et al., 1976; Wing and Remington, 1978).

Conversely, there are only a few compelling examples of the immune response to, or course of infection with, *T. gondii* being affected significantly. Thus, for example, infection with the gastrointestinal nematode worm, *Heligmosomoides polygyrus*, prior to infection with *T. gondii*, can alter the immune response to *T. gondii* so that co-infected mice have reduced IFN-γ production accompanied by reduced inflammation in the liver and ileum compared with *T. gondii*-only infected mice (Khan et al., 2008). The co-infected mice also have higher parasite burdens than singly infected mice and ultimately fail to develop *T. gondii*-specific CD8⁺ T cell immunity (Khan et al., 2008). Similarly, chronic (but not acute) infection with *H. felis* can alter the course of *T. gondii* infection in BALB/c mice – serum IFN-γ levels are lower in co-infected mice leading to uncontrolled tachyzoite replication, tissue damage and increased mortality compared with *T. gondii*-only infected mice (Stoicov et al., 2004). Chronic infection with the mite *Myocoptes musculinus* for 1 month prior to infection with *T. gondii* also alters the outcome of infection. Co-infected mice have reduced IFN-γ and increased IL-4 production leading to increased parasite burdens and increased mortality compared with singly infected animals (Welter et al., 2007).

On the other hand, there are numerous examples of *T. gondii* infection being largely unaffected by infectious agents that would normally be expected to stimulate production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, underscoring the unusual potency of the Th1 response provoked by *T. gondii*. Co-infection with the trematode worm *Fasciola hepatica* is one example. Infection of mice with *F. hepatica* ordinarily results in an early, and particularly potent, polarisation of the immune system towards a Th2 phenotype characterised by the production of high levels of the cytokines IL-4, IL-5 and IL-10. The parasite is also able to suppress production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ and IL-2 (O’Neill et al., 2000). Although infection with *F. hepatica* has been shown to affect the outcome of vaccination and infection with *Bordetella pertussis* (a bacterial pathogen controlled via a Th1 immune response; Brady et al., 1999), it has virtually no impact on the development of the Th1 response stimulated by *T. gondii* (Miller, C.M.D., Smith, N.C., Ikin, R.J., Boulter, N.R., Dalton, J.P., Donnelly, S., unpublished observations). Similarly, Th2 responses induced by infection with the intestinal nematode, *N. brasiliensis*, are not able to alter the course of infection with *T. gondii* cysts in co-infected C57BL/6 mice (Liesenfeld et al., 2004). Finally, infection with *Schistosoma mansoni* is able to suppress systemic production of IFN-γ and NO in response to *T. gondii* infection, resulting in severe liver pathology and death of co-infected mice, but does not affect the number of protozoans that become encysted in the brains of infected mice (Marshall et al., 1999). This indicates that a specific, perhaps localised, Th1 response still manages to develop and successfully control *T. gondii*, an idea given further credence by the fact that similar experiments in IL-12⁻/⁻ mice saw a relatively uncontrolled replication of *T. gondii* tachyzoites (Araujo et al., 2001).

### 7. The influence of pregnancy on infection with *T. gondii*

All the host responses outlined above are valid in normal immunocompetent individuals. However, the situation that arises during pregnancy is a little different because a number of immunological alterations occur, which are designed to favour maternal tolerance to paternal alloantigens, aid the successful implantation of a placenta and, subsequently, ensure the survival of the developing foetus. A number of hormones increase in circulating concentration during pregnancy including oestrogen, testosterone and, most significantly, progesterone (Roberts et al., 1996, 2001, 2007). It is now well established that progesterone inhibits IL-12, TNF and NO production by macrophages (Miller and Hunt, 1996; Miller et al., 1996; Jones et al., 2008), increases production of IL-10 by DCs (Huck et al., 2005), reduces NK cell activity (Roberts et al., 2001; Barakonyi et al., 1999; Faust et al., 1999; Polgar et al., 1999, 2003), inhibits development of Th1 T cell responses (Miyaura and Iwata, 2002) and encourages development of a Th2 response (Lin et al., 1993; Piccinni et al., 1995, 2000a,b). These alterations occur because, generally, a pro-inflammatory TH1-type immune response is incompatible with successful pregnancy (Raghupathy, 1997). This, of course, can compromise the ability of the host to control intracellular infections and, indeed, the severity of several infectious diseases can be greater during pregnancy including those caused by *Plasmodium chabaudi*, *L. major*, *Leishmania donovani* and *T. gondii*, to name a few (Luft and Remington, 1982; Akingbade, 1992; Shirahata et al., 1992; Engelen et al., 1996; Krishnan et al., 1996a; Pagliano et al., 2005). Conversely, the success of pregnancies can be affected by the same infectious diseases as pro-inflammatory responses compromise the health of the foeto-placental unit, causing spontaneous abortions, foetal resorptions and stillbirths (Raghupathy, 1997; Krishnan et al., 1996b).

#### 7.1. Pregnancy increases susceptibility to *T. gondii*

Pregnant mice are more susceptible to infection with *T. gondii* and this is associated with a reduction in IFN-γ production (Luft and Remington, 1982; Shirahata et al., 1992). This susceptibility includes an increased mortality rate that, predictably, can be reversed by administration of IFN-γ and IL-2 (Shirahata et al., 1993). Pregnant IL-4⁻/⁻ mice also show a decrease in susceptibility to toxoplasmosis, similarly indicating the importance of IFN-γ and associated Th1-type responses in resistance during pregnancy (Thouvenin et al., 1997).

Whilst susceptibility to an acute primary infection with *T. gondii* is widely accepted to be enhanced by pregnancy, it has been long believed that reactivation of a chronic infection during pregnancy is an extremely rare event. However, a recent study calls that belief into doubt as, by following 18 females with chronic *T. gondii* infection, Garweg et al. (2005) found that seven (i.e., nearly 40%) of the women suffered reactivation of ocular infection. Roberts et al. (2007) believe that the real incidence of reactivation of chronic infection during pregnancy may, therefore, be much higher as it may go undetected if it occurs in less obvious sites than the eye.

#### 7.2. Toxoplasma gondii is transmitted congenitally

As a general rule, *T. gondii* infections that arise prior to pregnancy pose little or no risk to the developing foetus, however there have been recent reports indicating that congenital transmission from a chronic *T. gondii* infection is possible in humans (Kodjikian et al., 2004) and sheep (Williams et al., 2004a,b; Morley et al., 2005). Primary infections contracted during pregnancy are another matter; congenital transmission of primary *T. gondii* infection in mice has been recognised for nearly half a century (Beverley,
1959). In both mice and humans, the transmissibility of the parasite increases with increasing period of gestation, so that a pregnant female infected in the first trimester is less likely to pass on the parasite to her baby than someone infected in the third trimester (McCabe et al., 1987; Roberts and Alexander, 1992; Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004). This may simply reflect the fact that the maternal–foetal interface increases as pregnancy progresses. However, the relative balance of pro-inflammatory versus anti-inflammatory immune responses probably also plays a role in this (discussed further below).

Studies using RAG2$^{-/-}$ mice have been informative in understanding the immunological barriers to congenital transmission of *T. gondii*. RAG2$^{-/-}$ mice lack T and B cells, and can therefore be used to dissect the relative importance of innate immune responses in protection against congenital toxoplasmosis. Thus, RAG2$^{-/-}$ mice have significantly less foetal transmission of *T. gondii* compared with wild-type BALB/c mice, correlated with an increased number of NK cells, increased IFN-$\gamma$ secretion by spleen cells and decreased maternal parasitaemia (Abou-Bacar et al., 2004). Furthermore, NK cell depletion in RAG2$^{-/-}$ mice results in increased parasite load and also increased foetal transmission. Increased NK cell numbers in humans are also associated with increased foetal protection (Nigro et al., 1999). Neutralisation of IFN-$\gamma$ in both RAG2$^{-/-}$ mice and BALB/c mice exacerbates the disease in the mother but congenital transmission is actually decreased in the same mice, indicating that IFN-$\gamma$ plays a part in the actual transplacental transmission of *T. gondii*. Subsequent work has discovered that increased IFN-$\gamma$ levels facilitate binding of infected monocytes to trophoblast cells in the placenta via increased expression of ICAM-1 (Pfaff et al., 2005). *Toxoplasma gondii* has also been shown to use ICAM-1 to enhance invasion into endothelial cells (Barragan et al., 2005) and this may be a universal method employed by the parasite to improve its invasive abilities in non-immune cells.

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 2. Sequence of events following oral infection with *Toxoplasma gondii*. Following ingestion of *T. gondii* cysts, bradyzoites are released in the intestine. They convert to tachyzoites and move through the gut epithelium by infecting enterocytes. Infected enterocytes secrete chemokines and cytokines that attract neutrophils, macrophages and dendritic cells (DCs). Neutrophils quickly flood to the site of infection where they can phagocytose parasites and also release chemokines and cytokines such as IL-12, CCL3 and CCL4 that attract immature DCs (iDCs), macrophages and T cells. Neutrophils help in DC maturation by binding to iDCs and passing along endogenously produced TNF. Although neutrophils, macrophages and DCs all secrete IL-12, DCs are the most significant source in *T. gondii* infection. DCs also have a central role in the presentation of antigen to T cells and direct polarisation towards a Th1 adaptive response and the production of IFN-$\gamma$. Macrophages are the most important phagocytic cell and crucial in limiting initial dissemination of the parasite. Binding of antigen to their surface results in the production of endogenous TNF that, along with IFN-$\gamma$ produced by natural killer (NK) cells and T cells, classically activates them to secrete toxic reactive oxygen (ROI) and nitrogen (RNI) intermediates that kill the parasite. IL-12 and IL-18 from macrophages stimulate NK cells to produce IFN-$\gamma$ and up-regulate their cytotoxicity, respectively, while IL-18 together with IL-15 from enterocytes increases their proliferation. Secretion of CCL3 and CCL4 by enterocytes also attracts intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) that become cytotoxic for infected enterocytes and produce the anti-inflammatory cytokines TGF-$\beta$ and IL-10. These two cytokines are ultimately responsible for dampening the classical Th1 response and limiting inflammatory damage to the host following infection with *T. gondii*.

7.3. Infection with T. gondii can adversely affect pregnancy

As discussed above, if primary *T. gondii* infection is acquired during gestation then congenital infection may occur. However, foetal infection is much more severe if contracted early in the pregnancy and often leads to death of the foetus in utero and spontaneous abortion (Montoya and Liesenfeld, 2004). This is true in mice too which, understandably, have been studied in more depth than humans. Thus, Roberts and Alexander (1992) have shown that most infections in the first trimester result in abortion or foetal resorption. The intriguing counterbalance of severity of effects early in pregnancy versus higher congenital transmission of *T. gondii* later in pregnancy prompted Roberts et al. (2007) to speculate that the ability of *T. gondii* to provoke a potent pro-inflammatory response causes foetal loss in the first trimester of pregnancy but later, when the anti-inflammatory hormonal and immunological alterations that characterise pregnancy have been firmly established, the foetus is protected from damaging immunological reactions but, at the same time, is consequently more likely to be exposed to, and infected by, the parasites.

8. Conclusions and perspectives

The innate immune response to *T. gondii* involves a carefully balanced and coordinated series of interactions between a variety of cell types including enterocytes, neutrophils, DCs and macrophages (Fig. 2). Underpinning these interactions are a complex set of molecular signalling pathways resulting in the activation and regulation of cytokine responses and production of effector molecules. The ability of *T. gondii* to manipulate these responses is remarkable and, seemingly, not just devoted to maximising its own reproduction but also crucial in minimising host immunopathology. Understanding how the host initiates its innate control over *T. gondii* and, conversely, how *T. gondii* controls its own fate in the face of one of the most potent pro-inflammatory responses known, may be of enormous benefit in designing vaccines and/or immunotherapies against this significant pathogen. There is increasing recognition that innate immune factors and/or their regulation are outstanding targets for use as adjuvants or immunostimulants. TLR agonists such as poly I:C, lipid A, flagellin and CpG DNA are already being tested in this regard (reviewed by Gazzinelli and Denkers, 2006) and agents such as monophosphoryl lipid A and CpG-containing oligodeoxynucleotides have been proposed and used in vaccine formulations for *Toxoplasma*, *Leishmania* and the malaria parasite (Gazzinelli and Denkers, 2006). Molecules from *T. gondii* itself may find application in a similar way. Thus, cyclophilin 18, TgHSP70 and *T. gondii* profilin could all legitimately be regarded as “endogenous adjuvants” for this, and maybe other, parasitic infections (Schaap et al., 2007). Furthermore, given the apparent multiplicity of TLRs activated by *T. gondii*, not to mention its affects on the SOCS and STAT pathways, there may be a substantial number of immunotherapeutic or immunomodulating molecules remaining to be discovered in this remarkable parasite. It will be crucial to dissociate the beneficial immunological effects from the potential deleterious immunopathological effects of these chemical agents.
