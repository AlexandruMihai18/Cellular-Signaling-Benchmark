**Epigenetic control of MHC-II: interplay between CIITA and histone-modifying enzymes**

Eleni Zika and Jenny P-Y Ting

Recent advances have shown the crucial role of histone-modifying enzymes in controlling gene activation and repression. This led to the ‘histone code’ hypothesis, which proposes that combinations of histone modifications work in concert to affect specific gene expression. Mounting evidence suggests that the class II transactivator modulates promoter accessibility by coordinating the recruitment of chromatin modifiers in a time-dependent fashion. *MHC-II* expression is exquisitely controlled by these highly specific, coordinated and dynamic interactions at the promoter.

Introduction  
MHC class II (*MHC-II*) molecules play a fundamental part in the development of specific immune responses through their ability to present peptides derived from extracellular pathogens to CD4⁺ T lymphocytes. Given their crucial role in numerous aspects of immunity, including antigen presentation and T-cell selection and activation, it is essential that the expression of *MHC-II* is tightly regulated to ensure a vigorous response to foreign pathogens while minimizing the damage to host tissues. Such control is predominantly implemented at the transcriptional level by the master regulator, the class II transactivator (CIITA), and includes mechanisms involving the epigenetic modification and remodeling of chromatin [1–3].

Constitutive expression of *MHC-II* proteins is tissue specific and is restricted to antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages, dendritic cells and B cells, but can also be induced on other cell types following stimulation with cytokines such as IFN-γ. Cell-specific and cytokine-induced expression of *MHC-II* relies on CIITA, which was initially identified because of its ability to rescue *MHC-II* expression in the RJ 2.2.5 B-cell lymphoma cell line. Although CIITA does not bind DNA, it regulates the transcription of *MHC-II* and related genes by way of its highly dynamic interactions with specific transcription factors and cofactors, particularly modifiers of chromatin. Several reviews, including those cited above, have extensively discussed DNA-binding proteins that exert a profound effect on *MHC-II* expression, thus this topic will not be emphasized here. Several papers and reviews have also described epigenetic events that result in the repression of the *MHCIITA* gene (encoding the MHC-II transactivator) in trophoblasts or transformed cancer/leukemia cells or the induction of this gene upon cytokine treatment [4,5]. These events include DNA methylation [4] and histone deacetylation [5]. Because of space constraints, this topic will also not be emphasized, and the readers are referred to the above-mentioned reviews [4,5]. Instead, the current review will emphasize mounting evidence that has unveiled a protagonist role for CIITA in coordinating the recruitment of chromatin modifiers to the promoter.

### Overview of the MHC-II promoters  
*MHC-II* promoters share a common set of *cis*-acting elements that includes the W/S, X1, X2 and Y boxes, termed the S–X–Y module [3,6]. The sequence and stereospecific alignment of the S–X–Y module are highly conserved and necessary for optimal constitutive and cytokine-induced expression of *MHC-II* genes. The transcription factors that interact with this module are well characterized. The Y box binds the heterotrimeric transcription factor nuclear factor Y (NF-Y), which consists of A, B and C subunits [7,8]. The X1 region is recognized by the regulatory factor X (RFX) complex, which comprises RFX5, RFXANK (RFX-B) and RFXAP [9–11], whereas the downstream X2 box is bound by the cyclic AMP response element

MHC-II enhanceosome on the HLA-DRα promoter. MHC-II promoters share a common set of cis-acting elements including the W/S, X1, X2 and Y boxes (S–X–Y module). The Y element binds the heterotrimeric transcription factor NF-Y. The X1 region is recognized by the RFX complex, whereas X2 is bound by CREB. Although these transcription factors are ubiquitous and expressed constitutively, they fail to induce MHC-II transcription on their own. Instead they form a multiprotein complex known as the MHC-II enhanceosome that binds the S–X–Y module in a stereospecific and cooperative manner, and provides the appropriate interaction surface for the recruitment of CIITA, which is absolutely required for MHC-II expression. Upstream of the proximal promoter, a locus control region consisting of an inverted S–X–Y module has also recently been shown to associate with RFX and CIITA. CIITA also interacts with an array of TAFs and elongation factors such as pTEFb. Finally, CIITA was recently shown to interact with the kinases CDK7 and CDK9, which phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain tail of RNA polymerase II (Pol II). More interestingly, CIITA enhances the ability of CDKs to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II leading to initiation of mRNA synthesis. The IFN-γ response illustrated in the figure indicates events that occur in IFN-γ responsive cells. In the absence of IFN-γ, the association of transcription factors with the MHC-II promoter is weak or non-existent. Upon IFN-γ induction, CIITA is produced and induces or enhances the association of transcription factors with the promoter. However, not shown in this figure is that in B cells, transcription factor association with the MHC-II promoter occurs even in the absence of CIITA. The basis for the difference described during IFN-γ induction and in B cells is unknown.

the $MHC-II$ promoter, several groups have now demonstrated that CIITA controls $MHC-II$ transcription through multiple and synergistic interactions with the requisite transcription factors: RFX5, RFXANK, NF-YB, NF-YC and CREB (Figure 1) [3,6,12,14,15]. In addition to the specific players described above, CIITA also interacts with numerous cofactors, including chromatin-modifying enzymes and components of the basal transcription machinery, such as the histone acetyltransferases (HATs), CREB binding protein (CBP)/p300, p300/CBP associated factor (pCAF) and steroid receptor coactivator 1 (SRC-1), the TATA-binding protein (TBP), TATA-associated factors (TAFs) and transcription elongation factors. Importantly, CIITA also associates and cooperates with the ATP-dependent remodeling factor Brahma-related gene 1 (BRG-1), which plays a central role in modifying chromatin structure [18]. These interactions are crucial for the formation of a dynamic enhan- ceosome on the proximal S–X–Y module of the $MHC-II$ promoter, and occur in a stepwise manner that will be discussed in detail below.

### Histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases in CIITA-mediated transcription

In eukaryotes, DNA is tightly wrapped around histone octamers (nucleosomes), forming a highly compact—and yet very dynamic—structure, known as chromatin. The degree of DNA folding greatly affects transcription and therefore it is controlled by multiple protein complexes, which modify the histone tails. These modifications, which include acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination, modulate DNA accessibility and are therefore crucial for transcriptional regulation (Figure 2). Earlier data using the genomic footprinting assay have indicated a unique role for CIITA in modifying previously closed chromatin of silent $MHC-II$ and its related promoters to an open configuration, so that DNA-binding proteins can associate with these promoters [19]. The molecular mechanism(s) by which CIITA activates and regulates the transcription of $MHC-II$ genes has been an area of intense interest and is now known to involve the recruitment of HATs to the promoter. Several groups relied on the co-immunoprecipitation of either bacterially expressed or exogenously introduced mammalian proteins to demonstrate that CIITA interacts and cooperates with HATs, namely CBP/p300 [20–22] and pCAF [23], in the activation of $MHC-II$. This interaction was presumed to lead to enhanced histone acetylation; however, CIITA also appears to be a substrate of HATs. For example, one study showed that recombinant fusion CIITA can be acetylated by CBP and pCAF in cell-free and whole-cell systems [23]. Amino acids that are targets of acetylation are also required for nuclear accumulation of CIITA [23,24].

More recent studies show that CIITA can also interact with another HAT, SRC-1, during $MHC-II$ transcription [25]. SRC-1 normally interacts with hormone-bound nuclear receptors and recruits acetylases and methylases. SRC-1 is recruited to the $MHC-II$ promoter upon IFN-$\gamma$ induction and can mediate the relief of $MHC-II$ inhibition by estrogens. These findings provide an important link between the steroid and IFN-$\gamma$ pathways, indicating cross-talk between major gene regulatory pathways.

The endogenous assessment of chromatin modification has been made possible by the advent of ChIP analysis, which detects proteins that are bound to endogenous promoters in real time. Further evidence for the crucial role of histone acetylation in $MHC-II$ transcription was produced using this technique and showed that the presence of CIITA correlates with increased histone H3 and H4 acetylation at the endogenous $MHC-II$ promoter in both B cells and in an IFN-$\gamma$ inducible cell line [26]. This H3 acetylation is dependent upon an intact transactivation domain within the CIITA protein, although the HAT responsible for this change is not known. Another report has shown that CIITA contains intrinsic HAT activity that resides within the transactivation domain and can substitute for TAF$_{II}$250 in the activation of $MHC-I$ [27].

In eukaryotes, DNA is wrapped around histone octamers, known as nucleosomes (green cylinders). These structures are the fundamental repeat unit of chromatin, which may exist in either a ‘closed’ or an ‘open’ conformation (in the ‘closed’ chromatin state DNA is inaccessible and transcription does not occur, whereas in the ‘open’ state DNA is exposed). The degree of chromatin folding is dynamic and greatly influences DNA accessibility and transcription. Consequently, it is tightly regulated through the modification of the histone tails. Such modifications include histone acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation and ubiquitination.

On the basis of these observations, Beresford and Boss [26] proposed that either CIITA recruits other HATs to cause appropriate histone acetylation or that the HAT activity intrinsic within CIITA might be responsible for histone acetylation. Interestingly, CBP with defective histone acetyltransferase activity cooperated well with CIITA [24], indicating that the HAT activity of CBP might not be required for MHC-II expression, thus favoring the possibility of other proteins, including CIITA, as potential sources of HAT activity.

Whereas HATs cooperate with CIITA in MHC-II gene activation, histone deacetylases (HDACs) provide the opposing force to decrease gene expression. Several reports relied on inhibitors of HDAC, such as trichostatin (TSA), to show that HDAC causes MHC-II gene suppression in diverse cell types including several tumors [28–30]. This raised the interesting possibility that HDAC inhibitors might be used to enhance tumor immunity [31]. The use of TSA also showed that HDAC controls histone acetylation at the MHC-II promoter, and this might be dependent upon the protein YY1 and a its cognate binding site within the MHC-II gene [28]. More recently, we showed that HDAC activity can cause the disassembly of the MHC-II enhanceosome, including the dissociation of CIITA, RFX and NF-Y from the MHC-II promoter, and we identified at least two HDACs that are involved in this process, HDAC1 and HDAC2 [32]. These two HDACs specifically repress IFN-γ activation

of MHC-II genes by inhibiting the transactivation function of CIITA. In addition, this repression relies on mSin3A (a corepressor of HDAC1 and HDAC2) but not NcoR (a corepressor of HDAC3). These results suggest a model in which HDAC1 and HDAC2, assisted by mSin3A, affect the function of CIITA by disrupting MHC-II enhanceosome formation. This inhibition also correlates with the direct interference of a novel modification of the CIITA protein—ubiquitination [33**]. Although ubiquitination has been conventionally thought to mark proteins for proteosome-mediated lysis, more recent data from multiple groups indicate that ubiquitination, particularly mono-ubiquitination, enhances the transactivation function of several transcription factors, including CIITA [33**, 34, 35]. The association of HDACs with CIITA and the effect of HATs on the modification of CIITA suggest that CIITA might be an enzymatic target of both the HDACs and the HATs described above and, thus, might act as a molecular switch by coordinating the functions of HATs and HDACs (Figure 3).

Although of less direct relevance to the expression of MHC-II, several groups have documented that CIITA can also reduce the expression of other genes through the sequestration of HATs from these other promoters (i.e. collagen and IL-4 promoters) [22, 36]. We first proposed that the well-described repressive effect of IFN-γ on gene expression might be mediated by the sequestration of CBP by CIITA, and concluded that the repressive

CIITA forms a network of multiple interactions with transcriptional cofactors. CIITA interacts with multiple chromatin modifying proteins including HATs (CBP/p300, pCAF and SRC-1), HMTs (CARM1), ATP-dependent remodeling enzymes (BRG-1) and HDACs (HDAC1, weakly with HDAC2). In addition, CIITA recruits multiple components of the basal transcription machinery including TBP, TAFII32, and the kinases CDK7 and CDK9 (not shown). Through these highly specific and dynamic interactions at the promoter, CIITA plays the protagonist role both in modulating chromatin structure and, therefore, in the activation and repression of MHC-II transcription. The CIITA-interacting components that are linked to chromatin remodeling (HATs, HMTs and SWI-SNF) with a green arrow have a positive effect, whereas HDACs (red arrow) have a negative effect.

domain was within a 36 residue region that binds CBP [22]. This is confirmed in later studies of other genes that are suppressed upon IFN-γ treatment [37*,38*].

# The role of arginine methylation in MHC-II gene regulation

The best characterized modification to date is acetylation—a modification primarily linked to transcriptional activation. Recent studies have, however, demonstrated that arginine-specific methylation mediated by histone methyltransferases (HMTs) is another important modification involved in modulating chromatin structure and gene transcription [39–43]. E Zika *et al.* (unpublished) show that CIITA specifically interacts with and recruits the coactivator-associated arginine-methyltransferase 1 (CARM1) to the *MHC-II* promoter, leading to methylation of Arg17 of histone H3. More intriguingly, CARM1 also leads to the methylation of CBP, a scenario found in two other studies of other transcription systems [42,43]. This modification stabilizes the association of CBP with the endogenous promoter and promotes *MHC-II* gene expression. These findings provide novel evidence for the crucial contribution of CARM1 and arginine methylation to the regulation of IFN-γ-mediated *MHC-II* gene expression.

## CIITA coordinates transcription initiation and elongation

The findings discussed above highlight the central role of CIITA in *MHC-II* transcription through the coordination of enhanceosome complex assembly. There is also evidence that CIITA directs transcription initiation, through its interaction with basal transcription factors including TBP and components of the TFIID complex such as TAFII32, TAFII70 and TFIIB [44,45]. Another study has shown that CIITA can substitute for the function of the coactivator TAFII250, strongly implicating CIITA in the initiation of transcription [46]. Finally, other studies have also implicated CIITA in promoter clearance and transcription elongation. One study showed that CIITA interacts with the cyclin T1 component of the positive transcription elongation factor b (p-TEFb) [47]. Another study showed the interaction of CIITA with the cyclin-dependent kinase 7 (CDK7) and CDK9 that phosphorylate the carboxy-terminal domain of RNA polymerase II and thereby control the transition from transcriptional initiation to elongation (Figure 1) [48**]. Interestingly, CIITA enhances the ability of CDK7 to phosphorylate RNA polymerase II at Ser5 leading to promoter clearance and initiation of mRNA synthesis. These findings support the hypothesis that CIITA might play a novel role in *MHC-II* transcription through the control of transcriptional initiation and elongation.

# Concluding remarks

The multiple interactions between CIITA and the HATs (CBP/p300, pCAF, SRC-1), HMTs (CARM1), HDACs (HDAC1), the RNA polymerase II machinery and DNA-binding proteins (RFX, NFY, CREB) give rise to the hypothesis that the alternative and/or combinatorial utilization of transcription cofactors is required for fine-tuning *MHC-II* gene expression. The recent findings discussed here indicate that CIITA is the central molecule in modulating chromatin structure, *MHC-II* enhanceosome assembly, and transcription initiation and elongation. Therefore, it controls the transcription of *MHC-II* genes by coordinating the temporal recruitment of distinct cofactors in response to cytokines (including IFN-γ) and other stimuli. Through highly specific and dynamic interactions between CIITA and various chromatin modifiers at the promoter, *MHC-II* and related genes are exquisitely controlled to ensure an effective response to pathogens while limiting reactions against self-antigens. Future endeavors to extend this knowledge to the regulation of CIITA target genes to modulate immune function should be of tremendous therapeutic potential.

The authors demonstrate the association of CIITA with kinases CDK7 and CDK9 during transcriptional activation. CIITA facilitates the phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II by CDK7, thereby enabling promoter clearance and elongation. Therefore, CIITA controls both transcription initiation and elongation.
