**Host-Pathogen Interaction in Amebiasis and Progress in Vaccine Development**

C.D. Huston, W.A. Petri Jr.

**Abstract** *Entamoeba histolytica*, the causative organism of invasive intestinal and extraintestinal amebiasis, infects approximately 50 million people each year, causing an estimated 40 to 100 thousand deaths annually. Because amebae only infect humans and some higher non-human primates, an anti-amebic vaccine could theoretically eradicate the organism. Uncontrolled epidemiologic studies indicate that acquired immunity to amebic infection probably occurs and that such a vaccine might be feasible. Application of molecular biologic techniques has led to rapid progress towards understanding how *Entamoeba histolytica* causes disease, and to the identification of several amebic proteins associated with virulence. These proteins are now being evaluated as potential vaccine components. Parenteral and oral vaccine preparations containing recombinant amebic proteins have been effective in preventing disease in a gerbil model of amebic liver abscess. Although systemic and mucosal cellular and humoral immunity both appear to play a role in protection against *Entamoeba histolytica*, the relative importance of each in the human immune response remains unknown. No animal model of intestinal amebiasis currently exists, moreover, so it has been impossible to evaluate protection against colonization and colitis. Further investigation of the fundamental mechanisms by which *Entamoeba histolytica* causes disease and of the human immune response to amebic infection is necessary to assess the true feasibility of an anti-amebic vaccine.

**Introduction**

Amebiasis, defined as invasive intestinal or extraintestinal disease due to *Entamoeba histolytica* infection, ranks second only to malaria as a protozoan cause of death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 50 million people worldwide suffer from invasive amebic infection each year, with a resultant 40 to 100 thousand deaths annually [1]. Infection with *Entamoeba histolytica* occurs worldwide, but people living in Central and South America, Africa, and India suffer from the majority of morbidity and mortality [2–4]. Carefully conducted serologic studies in Mexico, where amebiasis is endemic, demonstrated antibody to *Entamoeba histolytica* in 8.4% of the population [5]. In the urban slums of Fortaleza, Brazil, 25% of the people tested carried antibody to *Entamoeba histolytica*; the prevalence in children aged six to fourteen years was 40% [6].

In recent years, important advances have been made towards understanding amebiasis. On the basis of cumulative biochemical, immunological, and genetic data, Diamond and Clark [3] published a redescription of *Entamoeba histolytica* in 1993, which reclassified it as two morphologically identical but genetically distinct organisms: *Entamoeba histolytica*, the causative agent of invasive intestinal and extraintestinal amebiasis, and the nonpathogenic intestinal parasite *Entamoeba dispar*. The World Health Organization, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), and United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) officially accepted this reclassification in

1997 [1]. In addition, several amebic proteins associated with virulence have recently been identified as vaccine candidates [7–10]. Very little is known, however, about the human immune response to amebic infection, and about the feasibility of a vaccine. In a 1997 Weekly Epidemiological Record, the WHO stressed the importance of further research for the understanding of the host and parasite factors responsible for the invasiveness of *Entamoeba histolytica* and for fundamental studies on the immunology of human amebiasis [1]. This review summarizes our current knowledge of how *Entamoeba histolytica* causes invasive disease, our knowledge of the host immune response to amebic infection, and recent progress in development of a vaccine for amebiasis.

### Pathogenesis

It is generally accepted that *Entamoeba histolytica* invades tissue and causes clinical disease through a well-defined sequence of events [11–14]. The amebic trophozoite first adheres to the colonic mucus and epithelial cells through interaction of a Gal/GalNac inhibitable lectin with host glycoconjugates [7, 15]. It next secretes proteolytic enzymes that disrupt the intestinal mucus and epithelial barrier, and facilitate tissue penetration [8]. The trophozoite then kills host epithelial and immune cells, causing the characteristic flask-shaped colonic ulcers for which it is known. Finally, *Entamoeba histolytica* resists the host's immune response and survives to cause prolonged extraintestinal infection such as amebic liver abscesses.

### Adherence

Several investigators have observed adherence of *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites to the colonic mucosal surface prior to tissue penetration or cytotoxicity [12–14]. In vitro adherence assays using carbohydrate inhibitors have proven the pivotal role of glycoprotein binding proteins (lectins) in amebic adherence to target tissues [reviewed in reference 7]. In rosetting assays, adherence of *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites to human erythrocytes and Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells is inhibited approximately 90% by millimole concentrations of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and D-galactose, but not by other sugars [16]. Importantly, the Gal/GalNac inhibitable lectin also mediates adherence to human neutrophils, colonic mucins, and epithelial cells, the in vivo targets of *Entamoeba histolytica* [17–19]. The virulence of different *Entamoeba histolytica* strains, moreover, correlates with lectin-mediated adherence [17].

The Gal/GalNac inhibitable lectin of *Entamoeba histolytica* is a 260-kDa heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of a single 170-kDa heavy subunit and a light subunit weighing either 35 or 31 kDa [20, 21]. The 170-kDa subunit contains a carboxyl-terminal cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain adjacent to a cysteine-rich extracellular domain [22]. Five distinct genes (termed hgl1 to hgl5) encoding the lectin’s heavy subunit have been identified and at least partially sequenced. Ramakrishnan et al. [23] demonstrated simultaneous expression of three different heavy subunit genes. At least 89% sequence homology exists within this gene family, and the number and location of every cysteine residue is conserved within the regions sequenced to date [22, 23]. Anti-lectin monoclonal antibodies directed against the cysteine-rich extracellular domain inhibit adhesion of *Entamoeba histolytica* in vitro [20, 24, 25].

The function of the 35- and 31-kDa subunits remains unclear. Their amino acid composition is similar, with differences in size apparently accounted for by carbohydrate and lipid modifications. Both proteins contain conserved transmembrane regions and putative glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor cleavage/addition sites 15 amino acids from the carboxyl terminus [21]. Six to seven gene loci and at least three unique genes coding for the light subunit exist and are simultaneously expressed. The multiplicity of genes encoding the heavy and light subunits of the Gal/GalNac lectin and their complex pattern of expression may reflect distinct, as yet unknown, functions for the individual gene products [23].

### Invasion

After amebic trophozoites successfully adhere to the colonic mucosa, the host may remain asymptomatic [26, 27]; alternatively, the trophozoite may spontaneously penetrate the colonic mucus and epithelial barrier in a first step towards invasive disease. Penetration to the lamina propria can occur in the absence of local inflammation [12, 13]. Early studies on pathogenicity suggest that a secreted protease facilitates tissue penetration. CHO cell monolayers suffer a cytopathic effect characterized by loss of adhesion to culture plates upon exposure to sonicated trophozoite, but the protease inhibitor alpha II macroglobulin completely blocks cytopathicity [28].

Two classes of amebic proteinases believed to play a role in pathogenesis have been isolated: thiol (cysteine) proteinases which are secreted as well as located on the amebic cell surface, and a surface-bound metallocollagenase [reviewed in reference 8]. Several investigators have independently purified amebic cysteine proteinases, and confirmed their ability to degrade relevant tissue proteins in vitro including type I collagen and the anchoring proteins fibronectin and laminin [29–31].
The cysteine proteinases also degrade IgA, IgG, and the complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a [32–35].

A total of six distinct *Entamoeba histolytica* genes (termed EhCP1 through EhCP6) encoding typical precursors of cysteine proteinases have been identified and partially sequenced. Cysteine proteinase activity in lysates from various *Entamoeba histolytica* isolates can be almost completely attributed to expression of three of these genes: EhCP1, EhCP2, and EhCP5. *Entamoeba dispar* carries genes homologous to four of the six genes carried by *Entamoeba histolytica* (termed EdCP2, EdCP3, EdCP4, and EdCP6), but appears to lack genes similar to EhCP1 and EhCP5 [36]. In *Entamoeba dispar*, the most abundant RNA encoding a cysteine proteinase corresponds to the EdCP3 gene, which contributes very little to the proteinase activity of *Entamoeba histolytica* [37]. Differences in the genes encoding cysteine proteinases and in their expression may partially explain the differences in pathogenicity between *Entamoeba histolytica* and *Entamoeba dispar*.

Expression of the cysteine proteinases by *Entamoeba histolytica* is spontaneous [38], and the in vitro ability of trophozoites to degrade collagen correlates with virulence [29, 39, 40]. Reduction in the size of amebic liver abscesses in animals treated with proteinase inhibitors following intrahepatic injection of virulent trophozoites confirms the role of cysteine proteinases in pathogenicity [41]. The metallocollagenase of *Entamoeba histolytica* degrades type I and type III collagen [42]. Although this protein is surface bound and expressed in lesser amounts than the thiol proteinase, its expression also correlates with pathogenicity [8, 42].

### Cytolytic Activity

The cause of the remarkable cytolytic activity for which *Entamoeba histolytica* is named has been the subject of intense investigation. In vitro, amebic trophozoites incubated with human neutrophils at ratios of 1:200 remain 100% viable at three hours while more than 75% of the neutrophils are killed [17]. Moments after contacting the trophozoite, target cells undergo membrane blebbing, and loss of cytoplasmic granules and membrane integrity followed within five to fifteen minutes by cell death [4]. Studies using cinemicrography show that blebbing and cell death of CHO cell monolayers occurs only upon direct contact between amebae and their target cell [28]. The calcium channel blockers verapamil and bepridil significantly inhibit amebic cytotoxicity, as do the calcium chelator ethylene-diaminetetraacetate (EDTA) and the putative blocker of intracellular calcium flux 8-(N,N-diethylamino)octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8) [43,44]. As determined by studies utilizing the fluorescent calcium probe Fura-2 AM, there is a marked irreversible rise in the target cell’s intracellular calcium concentration within 30 seconds of contact with a trophozoite. The addition of D-galactose completely blocks both this calcium flux [45] and cytolysis [16]. Since abutment of trophozoites and target cells via centrifugation in the presence of galactose is not adequate to promote killing, the Gal/GalNac lectin appears to participate actively in the cytolytic process rather than simply bringing host cells and amebae together [16]. Upon incubation of CHO cells with purified Gal/GalNac lectin at sublethal concentrations, a reversible rise in intracellular calcium concentration of magnitude and speed comparable to that observed with whole amebae occurs [45]. Minimal chromium release from CHO cells incubated with affinity-purified lectin, however, suggests that the lectin alone is not cytotoxic; the possibility that the lectin is directly cytotoxic remains, because the purification process may alter it in ways important to cytotoxicity without altering its adherence properties [46].

The ultimate cause of target cell lysis induced by *Entamoeba histolytica* remains unclear, and morphologic evidence suggesting both programmed cell death and/or necrosis exists. Compaction of nuclear chromatin, cytoplasmic condensation, and membrane blebbing, as well as DNA fragmentation characteristic of apoptotic cell death has been observed in a murine myeloid cell line incubated with *Entamoeba histolytica*. Overexpression of the Bcl-2 gene, a protein that prevents apoptosis triggered by some stimuli, did not rescue exposed cells. It is possible that *Entamoeba histolytica* activates a step beyond Bcl-2’s blockade of apoptosis to cause programmed cell death [47]. Using leukemic cells, Jurkat T cells, and human neutrophils, other investigators have observed changes more consistent with necrosis including cytoplasmic swelling, and compromised membrane integrity as judged by failure to exclude trypan blue stain. The terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling technique (TUNEL assay), moreover, failed to show the internucleosomal degradation of DNA characteristic of programmed cell death [48].

Several laboratories have reported the isolation of amebic pore-forming proteins similar in function to the pore-forming proteins of the immune system [49–52]. A 5-kDa polypeptide with pore-forming activity in liposomes has been described which may be the major effector molecule mediating the extraordinary cytolytic activity of *Entamoeba histolytica* [51]. The amoebapore [reviewed in reference 9] is a 77 amino acid polypeptide. Computer aided analysis of secondary structure predicts four adjacent α-helices with tertiary structure maintained by three disulfide bonds [53]. Synthetic peptides based on the amino acid sequence of the amoebapore possess cytolytic activity against bacteria and eukaryotic cells [54]. Unlike the cysteine protease, the amoebapore is not spontaneously released by intact trophozoites. Instead, release likely occurs onlyafter direct contact of the ameba with its target cell [38].

# Evasion of Host Defenses

*Entamoeba histolytica* utilizes multiple non-specific and specific means to evade host defenses and survive within the gut and at extraintestinal sites of infection. The cyst form of *Entamoeba histolytica* is resistant to gastric acidity, chlorination, and desiccation, and can survive in a moist environment for several weeks [4]. The cysteine-rich makeup of surface antigens on the intestinal parasite *Giardia lamblia* has been postulated to play a role in protease resistance. Similarly, the cysteine-rich composition of the amebapore and the Gal/GalNac lectin may be important for survival of amebae in the harsh environment of the gut [22].

During hematogenous spread to distant sites, trophozoites are continually exposed to serum complement. Both *Entamoeba dispar* and *Entamoeba histolytica* activate serum complement, and can resist complement mediated lysis [55–58]. Complement activation itself might induce complement resistance. Complement-sensitive *Entamoeba histolytica* clones develop resistance to complement-mediated lysis when cultivated in increasing concentrations of normal human serum, but clones grown in heat-inactivated serum do not develop resistance [58]. Monoclonal antibodies directed against an extracellular domain of the Gal/GalNac adherence lectin completely eliminate resistance to complement-mediated lysis. The lectin shares sequence similarities and antigenic cross-reactivity with CD59, a human leukocyte antigen with the capacity to prevent assembly of the C5b-9 complement membrane attack complex [24, 59]. Moreover, the cysteine proteinases activate complement by cleaving C3 and C5 to produce C3b and the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a; both C3a and C5a are also rapidly degraded. In this way, cysteine proteinases may protect *Entamoeba histolytica* from the inflammatory reaction that activation of complement generates [35].

Amebae are also resistant to opsonization. The cysteine proteinases degrade secretory IgA [32] and serum IgG [33, 34]. Cysteine proteinase mediated cleavage of IgG reduces antibody binding to amebic trophozoites by approximately 84% [33]. Motile trophozoites also appear to resist the humoral immune response by shedding opsonized surface antigens. During locomotion, *Entamoeba histolytica* forms a large frontal pseudopod and a posterior appendix referred to as a uroid [reviewed in reference 60]. Accumulation of amebic surface antigens within the uroid, so-called capping, followed by spontaneous release of the cap without damage to the trophozoite occurs following agglutination by immune globulins in vitro. New surface proteins are made continually during this process [61]. RacG, a small guanosine triphosphate (GTP) binding protein analogous to the human protein Rac1, regulates uroid formation [62, 63]. The aggregation of myosin II within the uroid and blockade of capping with the inhibitor of actin polymerization, cytochalasin D, indicates that the amebic cytoskeleton probably mediates capping. Two major amebic antigens, a 96-kDa surface antigen and the Gal/GalNac lectin have been found to accumulate within caps. When *Entamoeba histolytica* releases caps coated with antibodies, it may enhance survival of the organism [64].

During acute invasive amebiasis, antigen-specific cell-mediated immune responses are suppressed as indicated by anergy to skin testing [65]. While anergy is frequently associated with severe acute infections, *Entamoeba histolytica* may actively delay the development of effective cell-mediated immunity [reviewed in reference 66]. Macrophages activated by gamma interferon (IFN-γ) effectively kill virulent amebae indicating that production of cytokines by TH1-type lymphocytes may be essential to an effective immune response [67–71]. Selective activation of TH2-type cells and inhibition of TH1 cells, however, has been demonstrated in response to immunization of mice with one amebic antigen [72]. Sera from patients with amebic liver abscesses, moreover, suppress T cell proliferation in response to *Entamoeba histolytica* sonicate [73]. Patients treated for amebic liver abscess have lower CD4 to CD8 T cell ratios and less T cell proliferation following exposure to amebic antigen than age- and sex-matched controls [74].

*Entamoeba histolytica* directly suppresses macrophage and monocyte activation. In gerbils, macrophages taken from granulomatous tissue surrounding amebic liver abscesses have decreased ability to respond to lymphokine activation with a respiratory burst, while macrophages taken from distant sites in the same animal respond normally. These findings suggest that integral and/or secreted amebic products actively interfere with macrophage activation [75]. *Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites also alter antigen presentation. Macrophages exposed to *Entamoeba histolytica* sonicate produce prostaglandin E₂, which interferes with expression of the class II major histocompatibility complex immune-associated (Ia) antigen [76].

## Immunity and Vaccine Feasibility

In the wild, *Entamoeba histolytica* only infects humans and some higher non-human primates [2, 4]. The absence of a large animal reservoir makes it theoretically possible to eliminate amebiasis from the world with a vaccine protective against colonization. Historically, successful vaccines have been possible for diseases such as smallpox and mumps in which infection results in resistance to reinfection [10].
Limited data suggesting acquired immunity to invasive amebiasis exists. Clinicians in endemic areas have made anecdotal observations that liver abscess infrequently recurs [77]. In addition, the hospital charts of 1021 patients cured of amebic liver abscess in Mexico City between 1963 and 1968 were reviewed to see if patients had been readmitted to the study hospital with recurrent hepatic amebiasis. Only three patients were readmitted during this time with a diagnosis of amebic liver abscess, substantially less than predicted in the study population. There was no knowledge, however, of the patients' current whereabouts or of admission to other hospitals [78]. Controlled trials are needed to establish whether protective immunity to invasive disease truly develops.

Data also suggest that immunity to colonization develops [79–81]. In a South African study, 20 asymptomatic subjects carrying *Entamoeba histolytica* were prospectively followed. Colonization resolved spontaneously in 90% (18/20) at 12 months; the remaining two people were not tested [79]. Although colonization following invasive infection occurs, individuals with serum anti-amebic antibodies indicating previous infection are less likely to become colonized than seronegative controls [80]. Measured antibodies in these studies may not mediate resistance to colonization. Effective protection from *Entamoeba histolytica* probably requires coordination of both the mucosal and systemic humoral and cell-mediated immune responses.

The Mucosal Immune Response

The interaction between *Entamoeba histolytica* and the colonic epithelium is dynamic. Binding of colonic mucins to the Gal/GalNac lectin facilitates colonization, but serves as the host's first line of defense against amebic cytolytic activity by inhibiting adherence to epithelial cells [19]. Goblet cells increase production of intestinal mucus soon after infection [82, reviewed in reference 83]. It is unclear whether increased mucus production ultimately depletes intestinal mucus and facilitates invasive disease, or facilitates expulsion of *Entamoeba histolytica* from the gut, as has been demonstrated in several nematode infections [83]. Prematurely secreted mucus may contain incompletely synthesized glycoproteins unable to inhibit adherence of trophozoites to the epithelium [82].

Anti-amebic secretory IgA has been identified in intestinal secretions and in breast milk [84–88, reviewed in reference 89]. Del Muro et al. [85] found salivary IgA in 85% of asymptomatic cyst passers, but follow-up studies suggest IgA may only be produced in response to invasive disease [86]. Patients with amebic liver abscess have salivary IgA to the Gal/GalNac adherence lectin [87]. While the role of secretory humoral immunity remains uncertain, anti-lectin IgA antibodies might effectively prevent adherence to epithelial cells and trap trophozoites within the intestinal mucus layer where they can be swept out by peristalsis.

In animal models, acute amebic lesions are characterized by extensive inflammatory infiltrates, predominantly neutrophils [12–14]. This local inflammation may be initiated through the actions of proinflammatory cytokines released by colonic epithelial cells. In vitro, human epithelial and stromal cell lines cocultured with amebic trophozoites express and secrete high levels of interleukin(IL)-8, IL-6, IL-1α, GROα, and granulocyte monocyte/macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Paracrine action of cytolytically released IL-1α appears to stimulate release of other cytokines, as does contact of trophozoites with epithelial cells via the Gal/GalNac adherence lectin [90].

The Systemic Immune Response

The specific contributions of systemic humoral and cell-mediated immunity in defense against *Entamoeba histolytica* are not firmly established. Amebic infection elicits a humoral immune response in nearly everyone suffering from invasive amebiasis [65, 79–81, 91]. Protection afforded by the humoral immune response, however, is likely to be incomplete. While most asymptomatic cyst passers eventually become parasite free, many remain infected for months after developing anti-amebic antibodies [79–81]. The minority who develop liver abscess, moreover, typically suffer from progressive disease despite a brisk humoral immune response [73, 92, 93]. This does not necessarily mean that preexisting humoral immunity cannot prevent disease. Studies utilizing severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice lacking functional B and T lymphocytes demonstrate the importance of humoral immunity. SCID mice have increased risk of developing amebic liver abscesses following intrahepatic injection of virulent trophozoites, but passive immunization with anti-amebic antibodies protects against infection in this system [94].

Reports of fulminant invasive amebiasis in patients receiving corticosteroids imply an important role for cellular immunity in protection against *Entamoeba histolytica* [95]. Expected increases in amebic liver abscess in the setting of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), however, have not occurred [10]. In animal models, depression of cell-mediated immunity via splenectomy, corticosteroids, and neonatal thymectomy increases susceptibility to liver abscess following intrahepatic challenge with amebic trophozoites [96–98]. Human patients successfully cured of amebic liver abscess develop cell-mediated resistance to *Entamoeba histolytica* characterized in vitro by enhanced T cell proliferation and generation of T cells capable of killing trophozoites following incubation with whole

amebic antigen [74]. Nitric oxide (NO) mediated amebicidal activity of lymphokine (e.g. IFN-γ and TNF-α) activated macrophages and neutrophils suggests an important role for the TH1 subset of lymphocytes [67–71]. Early amebic liver abscess in gerbils, however, is associated with a TH0 or mixed TH1 and TH2 response characterized by production of both IL-2 and IL-4. An early TH2-type response may facilitate amebic survival within the developing liver abscess. Chronically infected gerbils eventually mount a TH1-like response, and gerbils cured of amebic liver abscess with drugs are resistant to reinfection and manifest a TH1-type response [99].

Responses to individual amebic antigens may vary. Although some amebic proteins appear to elicit a predominantly TH2-type response [72], serum lymphocytes from gerbils previously immunized with the Gal/GalNac lectin and from patients carrying antibody to the lectin proliferate and produce IL-2 and IFN-γ characteristic of the TH1 response when incubated with the lectin’s heavy subunit [100, 101]. The Gal/GalNac lectin can activate IFN-γ primed macrophages for amebicidal activity mediated by nitric oxide [102]. Incubation of primed macrophages with the lectin’s heavy subunit results in increased expression of TNFα and NO in a dose-dependent manner. Antibodies to the lectin’s cysteine-rich extracellular domain can block macrophage activation as well as adherence to mammalian cells, suggesting that the same regions of the lectin are responsible for both adherence and macrophage activation [103, 104].

Neutrophils are the first inflammatory cells found surrounding amebic abscesses in animal models [105]. Two days after intrahepatic challenge, neutrophil-depleted SCID mice have significantly larger abscesses than control SCID mice. By seven days, abscess size in

control and neutrophil depleted mice is no longer significantly different. Neutrophils appear to be important for early control of amebiasis, therefore, while macrophages and/or natural killer cells may be recruited during chronic infection [106]. In the presence of preexisting cell-mediated immunity, primed neutrophils and macrophages might successfully limit invasive amebic infections.

## Vaccine Candidates

Although whole *Entamoeba histolytica* protein elicits a protective immune response indicating that an effective anti-amebic vaccine is possible, vaccines using native antigens are expensive and impractical to produce. This has driven an aggressive search for antigens that might form the basis of a cheap, recombinant vaccine [reviewed in reference 10]. Candidate proteins (see Table 1) should be conserved, highly immunogenic surface antigens. Amebic proteins critical to pathogenesis including the Gal/GalNac lectin, the cysteine proteinases, and the amoebapore are obvious possibilities. The use of cDNA libraries has resulted in isolation of two additional candidates: the serine-rich *Entamoeba histolytica* protein (SREHP), and the 29-kDa cysteine-rich *Entamoeba histolytica* antigen [107, 108].

## Parenteral Vaccines

The Gal/GalNac lectin meets all of the basic requirements for a vaccine candidate. As previously discussed, the lectin plays an essential role in adherence and cytotoxicity, as well as in resistance to serum complement [7, 16–19, 24, 59]. In addition, the lectin’s cysteine-rich extracellular domain is highly conserved [22, 23]. The 170-kDa heavy subunit is the predominant amebic

protein recognized by immune sera of individuals cured  
of invasive amebiasis from geographically diverse areas  
including the United States, Mexico, Africa, India, and  
Jordan [109]. More than 90% of sera from individuals  
with amebic liver abscess or asymptomatic colonization  
with *Entamoeba histolytica* contain anti-lectin anti-  
bodies [110, 111], and *Entamoeba histolytica* can be  
distinguished from *Entamoeba dispar* using an enzyme  
immunoassay directed against the lectin [6, 110].  
Humoral and mucosal IgA against a recombinant  
portion of the lectin’s cysteine-rich extracellular  
domain (termed LC3) are found in approximately 84%  
of patients with amebic colitis [88], and serum anti-  
bodies to this region are found in approximately 95%  
of patients with amebic liver abscess [112].

In one study, 100% of gerbils immunized with purified  
native Gal/GalNac lectin in complete Freund’s adju-  
vant developed high titer serum antibodies to the heavy  
subunit. Immune sera completely blocked amebic  
adherence to CHO cells at 1/10 dilutions, and 67% of  
gerbils were completely protected from liver abscess  
following intrahepatic injection of trophozoites.  
Surprisingly, the remaining animals developed larger  
abscesses [113]. Antibodies to different epitopes on the  
lectin’s 170-kDa heavy subunit variably enhance or  
inhibit amebic adherence to CHO cells and to human  
colonic mucins [24, 25], but no differences in the deve-  
lopment of anti-lectin antibodies or their adherence-  
inhibitory properties were observed in the immunized  
gerbils [113].

Parenteral immunization with two different recombi-  
nant peptides based on the cysteine-rich extracellular  
portion of the lectin’s heavy subunit has been protec-  
tive in the gerbil model of amebic liver abscess. In one  
study, immunization of gerbils with the recombinant  
LC3 region and Titermax adjuvant elicited a high titer  
serum IgG response capable of inhibiting amebic  
adherence to CHO cells. There was a 71% reduction in  
the number of animals with liver abscesses following  
intrahepatic challenge and, in contrast to abscesses  
following immunization with the native lectin,  
abscesses in the immunized gerbils that developed  
them were no larger than in controls [112]. Similarly,  
Lotter et al. [114] immunized gerbils with several  
recombinant peptides based on the carboxyl-terminal  
portion of the lectin’s cysteine-rich extracellular  
domain. Immunization with a 115 amino acid peptide  
(termed 170CR2) completely prevented abscess devel-  
opment in 62.5% of animals and the remaining animals  
in this study developed significantly smaller abscesses  
than unimmunized controls. Antibody production to a  
25 amino acid sequence within 170CR2 correlated  
strongly with development of protective immunity.  
Successful passive immunization of SCID mice with  
rabbit serum raised against the peptide reconfirmed the  
importance of humoral immunity in prevention of  
amebic liver abscess [114].

Stanley et al. [107] identified the serine-rich *Entamoeba*  
*histolytica* protein (SREHP) by screening cDNA  
libraries. This protein, which shows great promise as a  
potential vaccine component, contains multiple tandem  
dodecapeptide repeats reminiscent of the repetitive  
circumsporozoite antigens of malarial species. Anti-  
bodies directed against a SREHP fusion protein reduce  
binding of amebic trophozoites to CHO cells up to  
approximately 30% of control levels, indicating that the  
native protein may play a role in adherence [107]. Indi-  
rect immunofluorescent staining localizes the native  
SREHP to the cell surface and to focal areas within the  
cytoplasm [115]. Southern and Northern blot analyses  
show that the SREHP is conserved and expressed in  
four strains of *Entamoeba histolytica*, while *Entamoeba*  
*dispar*, *Entamoeba invadens*, and *Entamoeba mosh-  
kovskii* lack DNA encoding the protein [107]. Different  
*Entamoeba histolytica* isolates have different numbers  
of dodecapeptide repeats encoded within their SREHP  
genes [116]. Western blots performed to detect anti-  
SREHP antibodies in patients from diverse geogra-  
phical regions with acute invasive amebiasis were posi-  
tive in 82%. Seropositivity ranged from 65% in  
Durban, South Africa, to 91% in Mexico City [117].  
Differences in the observed rates of anti-SREHP anti-  
body production may have been due to differences in  
the timing of serum sampling during the course of acute  
illness. They also raise the possibility that local popula-  
tions have differing abilities to produce anti-SREHP  
antibodies [117] or that differences in the number of  
SREHP repeats in different *Entamoeba histolytica*  
isolates affect immunogenicity [116].

Zhang et al. [118] tested the ability of recombinant  
SREHP to elicit a protective immune response against  
amebic liver abscess in gerbils. Gerbils were immunized  
either subcutaneously in a single shot, or intraperiton-  
eally in a series of three shots with a recombinant  
SREHP/maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion protein  
combined with complete Freund’s adjuvant. Immuniza-  
tion completely prevented amebic liver abscess  
following intrahepatic challenge in 64% of gerbils  
immunized intraperitoneally and 100% of gerbils  
immunized with a single subcutaneous shot. All of the  
immunized animals developed delayed-type hypersen-  
sitivity reactions [118]. African green monkeys immu-  
nized with three doses of the SREHP/MBP fusion  
protein developed serum anti-amebic antibodies ten  
days after the first booster. Unfortunately, the control  
monkeys in this trial did not develop liver abscesses  
following intrahepatic challenge, so that vaccine effi-  
cacy could not be assessed [119].

Screening of cDNA libraries also identified the 29-kDa  
cysteine-rich *Entamoeba histolytica* antigen, another  
immunogenic protein that may be suitable for inclusion  
in a vaccine [108]. The 29-kDa antigen appears to be a  
thiol-dependent peroxidase, since it possesses hydrogen  
peroxide-removing capacity in the presence of reducing  
agents such as thioredoxin [120, 121]. It may, therefore, protect *Entamoeba histolytica* from oxidative attack by activated neutrophils and macrophages. The location of the 29-kDa antigen within the ameba remains controversial. Immunofluorescent staining of formalin-fixed cells with monoclonal antibodies shows the protein within both the nucleus [122] and cytoplasm [121, 122]. The protein has been localized to the cell surface using indirect immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy [108, 123]. Southern and Northern blot analyses utilizing a partial cDNA probe showed that the protein's genetic code is conserved and translated in *Entamoeba histolytica*, as well as in *Entamoeba dispar*. Immunoblots against whole amebic protein, however, have only confirmed expression by *Entamoeba histolytica*. Epitope differences between *Entamoeba histolytica* and *Entamoeba dispar* may explain this apparent discrepancy [123]. An ELISA using purified native and recombinant 29-kDa protein demonstrated the presence of anti-29-kDa antibodies in 79% of people with amebic liver abscess, but failed to show significant antibody production in patients suffering from amebic colitis and in asymptomatic carriers [124]. Intraperitoneal immunization of gerbils with a recombinant fusion protein based on the 29-kDa protein and Titermax adjuvant elicited production of antigen-specific IgG and was partially protective (54% vaccine efficacy) against amebic liver abscess following intrahepatic challenge with virulent trophozoites [125].

The cysteine proteinases and the amoebapore are additional amebic proteins associated with virulence that must be considered. Each has yet to be evaluated as a potential vaccine component. Numerous studies document the central role of amebic cysteine proteinases in penetration of host tissues and in evasion of host defenses via degradation of IgA, IgG, C3a, and C5a [29–35, 39, 40]. Patients with amebic liver abscess, moreover, develop antibodies to histolsain (EhCP2) [126], and the use of protease inhibitors in SCID mice reduces the size of liver abscesses following intrahepatic injection of trophozoites [41]. The recombinant amoebapore’s cytotoxicity towards eukaryotic cells prohibits its use in a vaccine [54]. Identification of antigenic regions within this peptide, however, should yield other possible vaccinogens.

### Oral Vaccines

Two major oral vaccine strategies have been used: the incorporation of amebic antigens into attenuated bacterial strains, and the creation of fusion proteins composed of amebic antigens and cholera toxin or its subunits. An effective oral vaccine against *Entamoeba histolytica* could have several advantages over parenteral preparations. Direct stimulation of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) might stimulate production of secretory IgA more effectively than parenteral immunization, and prevent both colonization and invasive disease [127–129, reviewed in reference 130]. By establishing a limited invasive infection in the host, moreover, an oral vaccine carried by an attenuated bacterial strain might provide more prolonged immunity than parenteral vaccines based on the same antigens. Combination vaccines providing protection against multiple organisms may also be possible [130]. For example, immunization with attenuated *Salmonella typhi* strains engineered to express amebic antigens might protect against both amebiasis and typhoid fever. Finally, the lower cost and ease of administering an oral vaccine would increase acceptance in developing nations.

An oral attenuated vaccine for typhoid fever is currently in use in humans. Foreign antigens expressed in attenuated *Salmonella* species can effectively stimulate both cell-mediated immunity and production of secretory IgA [128]. Oral immunization of mice and gerbils with an attenuated strain of *Salmonella typhimurium* that expresses the SREHP/MBP fusion protein at high levels resulted in production of secretory IgA and serum IgG. Anti-lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies also developed in both sham-immunized and immunized animals, suggesting that the amebic antigen did not impair the immune response to the *Salmonella* infection. A vaccine protective against both, therefore, might be possible. Following intrahepatic injection with amebic trophozoites, 100% of control gerbils and only 22% of immunized gerbils developed abscesses in this study [131]. The SREHP/MBP fusion protein has now been expressed successfully in an attenuated strain of *Salmonella typhi*, without altering the strain’s attenuation. Mice parenterally immunized with this strain develop both serum anti-amebic and anti-LPS antibodies [132]. In another study, oral immunization of gerbils with *Salmonella dublin* expressing a fragment of the Gal/GalNac lectin resulted in significant reduction in mean abscess weight, but no significant difference in the number of animals developing abscesses. No serum anti-amebic antibody production was observed in this study, suggesting that the observed protection may have been cell-mediated. The plasmid carrying the lectin fragment, however, was somewhat unstable in vitro; higher or more prolonged expression of the antigen may have resulted in antibody production and in greater vaccine efficacy [128].

Cholera toxin has two subunits, a 28-kDa A subunit with ADP-ribosylating activity, and an 11.5-kDa B or binding subunit. The A subunit contains A₁, the active toxin domain, and A₂, which non-covalently links subunit A to five B subunits. A pentamer of B subunits binds the intestinal epithelium. Whole cholera toxin stimulates production of serum IgG and secretory IgA when orally administered, and also stimulates immunity to co-administered antigens. In humans, the B subunit

retains some of whole cholera toxin's oral adjuvant properties, and is unable to cause diarrhea [reviewed in reference 133].

Parenteral immunization of rats with native Gal/GalNac lectin in complete Freund's adjuvant followed by intra-Peyer's patch injection of lectin with the cholera toxin B subunit stimulates production of anti-lectin secretory IgA [134]. Oral immunization of mice with the recombinant LC3 portion of the lectin and whole cholera toxin induced production of secretory IgA capable of inhibiting adherence of amebic trophozoites to CHO cells. Interestingly, there was a negative correlation between intestinal IgA production, and serum IgA and IgG titers in this study [135]. High dose oral immunization with streptococcal antigens by other investigators has resulted similarly in a strong mucosal immune response with no systemic antibody production, while lower doses led both to mucosal and systemic antibody production [136]. The SREHP dodecapeptide repeat fused to cholera toxin's B subunit induced both mucosal and systemic anti-amebic antibodies in mice when coadministered orally with nontoxic doses of whole cholera toxin [137]. An attenuated El Tor strain of *Vibrio cholerae* has been engineered that expresses the SREHP dodecapeptide/cholera toxin B subunit fusion protein. Oral immunization of germ-free mice with this strain led to systemic and mucosal immune responses directed against both the SREHP and *Vibrio cholerae* [129].

A potential limitation of strategies combining recombinant peptides with cholera toxin's B subunit is that large attached molecules might prevent pentamerization of the B subunit and reduce its adjuvant properties by changing its ability to bind to intestinal epithelium. Coupling of antigens to the B subunit via A₂ to create holotoxin-like molecules could potentially increase their immunogenicity as well as facilitate the use of larger recombinant antigens [138]. A holotoxin-like molecule containing the SREHP fused to the A₂ domain of cholera toxin (SREHP-H) has been created. Oral immunization of mice with SREHP-H coexpressed with the cholera toxin B subunit in *Escherichia coli* resulted in production of mucosal IgA and serum IgG anti-amebic antibodies [139].

nization can develop [77–81]. Controlled prospective studies addressing the true feasibility of a vaccine, however, need to be done.

Amebic proteins that mediate adherence, tissue penetration, and cytotoxicity (the steps in development of invasive amebiasis) have recently been identified and are currently being evaluated as potential components of an anti-amebic vaccine [7–10]. Screening of cDNA libraries has identified several additional conserved antigenic proteins associated with virulence [107, 108]. Stable transfection and expression of recombinant proteins in *Entamoeba histolytica* has recently been achieved, and should facilitate in vivo investigation of the role of each of these proteins in causing disease [140–143].

Although progress towards an anti-amebic vaccine has been substantial, numerous problems need to be overcome before human trials can be conducted. The duration of acquired immunity in animal models and in humans remains completely unknown [10]. In the oral vaccine studies performed to date, protection has correlated with the level of antigen expression [128–131]. Methods to achieve more stable transfection and higher levels of expression of recombinant amebic antigens in attenuated bacterial strains need to be developed. In addition, all of the vaccine efficacy studies to date have been performed in the gerbil model for amebic liver abscess. Substantial interspecies differences in the immune response to *Entamoeba histolytica* infection, however, may exist. The lack of a primate model of infection is also a potential hindrance. While parenteral immunization of African green monkeys with the SREHP/MBP fusion protein resulted in a seemingly appropriate humoral immune response, attempts to establish amebic liver disease in these animals failed [119]. Additional animal models of extraintestinal amebiasis may need to be developed to establish whether the observations made thus far in gerbils apply to other species. Because no animal model for intestinal amebiasis exists, moreover, it is currently impossible to determine the relative roles of the mucosal and systemic immune responses in preventing initiation of amebic infection in the intestine, and the ability of current parenteral and oral vaccines to prevent intestinal disease [10].

An oral vaccine protective against several enteric infections may be the most cost-effective approach towards reducing morbidity and mortality from infectious diseases in the developing world [10]. In recent years, the major steps taken towards development of an effective vaccine for amebiasis have given reason to hope that such a vaccine might become available in the near future. An aggressive ongoing effort to understand the fundamentals of the host-parasite interaction in human amebiasis will be essential to accomplishing this goal [1].

### Conclusions and Areas for Further Investigation

Amebiasis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the tropical and subtropical world, with an estimated annual mortality in the range of 40,000 to 100,000 people [1, 2, 4]. Because *Entamoeba histolytica* naturally infects only humans and some higher non-human primates, an effective vaccine could theoretically eliminate it altogether [10]. Current data suggest that effective immunity to invasive disease and to colo-
