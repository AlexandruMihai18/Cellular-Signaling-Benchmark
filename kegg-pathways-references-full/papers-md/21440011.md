ABSTRACT

Forkhead box O (FoxO) transcription factors are downstream targets of the serine/threonine protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt. The Akt kinase regulates processes of cellular proliferation and survival. Phosphorylation of FoxOs by Akt inhibits transcriptional functions of FoxOs and contributes to cell survival, growth and proliferation. Emerging evidence suggests involvement of FoxOs in diverse intracellular signaling pathways with critical roles in a number of physiological as well as pathological conditions including cancer. The FoxO signaling is regulated by their interactions with other intracellular proteins as well as their post-translational modifications such as phosphorylation. FoxOs promote cell growth inhibitory and/or apoptosis signaling by either inducing expression of multiple pro-apoptotic members of the Bcl2-family of mitochondria-targeting proteins, stimulating expression of death receptor ligands such as Fas ligand and tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), or enhancing levels of various cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (CDKIs). Coupled with their ability to cross-talk with p53, FoxOs represent an important class of tumor suppressors in a variety of cancers. This review summarizes our current understanding of mechanisms by which Akt and FoxOs regulate cell growth and survival that in turn offers opportunities for development of novel strategies to combat cancer.

1. Introduction

Forkhead box transcription factors were named after the Drosophila forkhead gene, and this superfamily consists of 19 subclasses of Fox genes, FoxA–FoxS [1,2]. The members of this superfamily share a highly conserved DNA-binding FOX domain. Although some of the FOX genes are ubiquitously expressed, many members are expressed in a spatial and temporal manner. The FOX transcription factors that belong to the other (O) subfamily (FoxO) include only one member each in Caenorhabditis elegans (dauer formation-16) and Drosophila (dFoxO), and four members (FoxO1, 3, 4, 6) in mammals [1]. The FoxO transcription factors regulate cellular differentiation, growth, survival, cell cycle, metabolism, stress and tumor suppression pathways. FoxO1 (aka FKHR), FoxO3 (aka FKHRL1), and FoxO4 (aka AFX) are all expressed ubiquitously in mammals. The FoxO1 and FoxO4 transcripts however are highly expressed in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, respectively, while FoxO3 is abundant in various tissues including brain, heart, kidney, and spleen. FoxO6 mRNA on the other hand is expressed predominantly in the developing and adult brain, suggesting a role in nervous system [3]. FoxO proteins activate or repress transcription of target genes through their DNA-binding FOX

domain in the nucleus, and their nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is regulated by their specific nuclear export and import signal sequences. Subcellular localization and transcriptional functions of FoxOs are often regulated by their post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination [3].

Protein kinase B (PKB)/Akt pathway is an essential pathway for cell survival and growth during development and carcinogenesis. Akt is a serine-threonine kinase that is regulated mainly following activation of the second messenger phospholipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K). In mammals three closely related isoforms of Akt are encoded by distinct loci, and functional redundancy among Akt isoforms exists as suggested by lack of developmental defects in animals having targeted deletion of a specific isoform [4]. However, in spite of the functional redundancy, only Akt 2 and 3 isoforms are often pathologically amplified in human cancers. The PI3K/Akt signaling regulates cell proliferation and survival in part by phosphorylating FoxOs to promote their interaction with 14-3-3 protein that results in nuclear exclusion and eventual ubiquitin proteasome pathway (UPP)-dependent degradation of FoxOs [5].

2. AKT-FoxO signaling axis

The Akt kinase remains a subject of diverse investigations due mainly to its critical roles in a variety of pathways and cellular processes. Although the Akt signaling pathways are activated by receptor tyrosine

kinases, cytokine receptors, G-protein coupled receptors, B and T cell receptors, and integrins, two major cellular processes, insulin metabolism and cancer progression, are critically regulated by this kinase. Akt plays an important role in metabolism by targeting glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) to regulate glycogen synthesis. Akt regulates cell cycle and proliferation by directly targeting CDKIs p21<sup>WAF1/CLIP1</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, and indirectly by modulating levels of cyclin D1 and p53. Akt regulation of cell survival however involves direct inhibition (phosphorylation) of pro-apoptotic signals such as Bad and FoxOs. In the discussion below we summarize information on the roles of Akt in insulin metabolism and cell growth and survival pathways associated with carcinogenesis.

Signaling through the insulin and insulin-like growth factor (IGF) pathways is essential for nutrient homeostasis as well as for growth and development. In mammals the IGF signaling system includes three peptide hormones, insulin, IGF1 and IGF2, that are ligands for a series of receptor isoforms that includes two insulin receptors (IRa and IRb), the IGF1r receptor (IGF1r) and two receptor hybrids consisting of an IGF1r monomer and either an IRa or IRb monomer. There is also an IGF2 receptor (the mannose-6-phosphate receptor) that acts as a signaling antagonist. IRb predominates in insulin sensitive target tissues such as muscle, fat and liver and binds insulin with high affinity. IRa binds both insulin and IGF-2 with moderate affinity and is the predominant insulin receptor isoform in fetal tissues [6]. Upon ligand binding, the insulin or IGF receptors undergo tyrosine autophosphorylation, enhancing tyrosine kinase activity of the receptor and propagate signals through common pathways that include the insulin receptor substrate (IRS)/phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway [reviewed in 7]. The IRSs are recruited to the phosphorylated receptor by their phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) and pleckstrin homology (PH) domains. Receptor-bound IRS proteins that are phosphorylated by action of the intrinsic receptor tyrosine kinase bind several proteins via their SH2 domains. Among these is the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K. Recent work by Lim et al. [8] uncovered an important role for the Connector Enhancer of KSR 1 (CNK1) scaffold protein in recruitment of IRS1 to the membrane and downstream activation of the PI3K/Akt pathway. It was shown that CNK1 accumulates at the cell surface in insulin-treated cells and participates in localization of cytohesins at the cell surface. The cytohesins facilitate changes in the lipid environment of the cell membrane, resulting in generation of a phosphoinositide(4,5) bisphosphate (PIP2)-rich environment, essential for recruitment of IRS1 and signaling through PI3K [9]. Interaction between the IRS and both SH2 domains of p85 activates the catalytic (p110) subunit of PI3K. Activated PI3K phosphorylates its lipid substrate PIP2 to produce phosphoinositide (3,4,5)trisphosphate (PIP3), an important intracellular messenger. PIP3 recruits phosphatidylinositol-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and Akt, both Ser/Thr kinases, to the plasma membrane, wherein Akt is activated by PDK1-mediated phosphorylation. Signaling through the IRS/PI3K pathway can be modulated by phospholipid phosphatases, such as SHIP2 and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted from chromosome ten), which mediate dephosphorylation of PIP3. It is noteworthy that recent work has shown that CNK1 interacts with Akt, promoting cell proliferation through activation of the Akt/FoxO signaling cascade [10].

FoxOs also mediate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair and apoptosis [11]. Phosphorylation by Akt inactivates FoxOs resulting in their accumulation in the cytoplasm. Thus, signaling through the IRS/PI3K/Akt cascade, by inactivating FoxOs, results in decreased expression of negative cell-cycle regulators, such as retinoblastoma-related protein p130 and CDKI p27<sup>KIP1</sup>. Akt phosphorylation of FoxOs promotes cell survival since the FoxOs regulate the pro-apoptotic protein TRAIL. Cell survival is also promoted by Akt phosphorylation of BAD, a component of the BAD/Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> complex, resulting in dissociation of the complex [12]. Moreover, Akt also has the capacity to phosphorylate and activate IKKα a component of the upstream kinase that regulates NF-κB activation [13]. Activated IKKα phosphorylates IkB, targeting it for proteasomal degradation. As a result, NF-κB is activated and translocated into the nucleus, where it activates transcription of pro-survival genes. Activation of an alternative branch of the NF-κB pathway and consequent expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 in a CNK1-dependent fashion is thought to promote invasiveness of breast and cervical cancer cells [14].

Signaling through the insulin-like pathway thus results in activation of Akt, which, in turn, activates expression of pro-survival and anti-apoptotic genes. Situations may arise that will promote an increase in the strength or duration of Akt-activating signals. For example, mutations in PTEN may decrease dephosphorylation of PIP3; mutant forms of PI3K catalytic subunit may also result in increased abundance of PIP3. Mutations such as these are commonly encountered in a variety of cancers and not only highlight the importance of the PI3K/Akt signaling cascade but relevance of the Akt activation as a potential therapeutic target in cancer [15,16].

## 3. FOXO and suppression signaling

### 3.1. FoxO transcription factors—bona fide tumor suppressors

Increasing evidence shows that members of the FoxO subfamily are pivotal for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in organs and are frequently dysregulated in cancer. The role of FoxOs in tumorigenesis was initially discovered by their involvement in chromosomal translocations in human cancers [17–19]. For example, FoxO1, FoxO3A, and FoxO4 genes were found at chromosomal breakpoints in some forms of leukemia such as myeloid/lymphoid or mixed lineage leukemia (MLL) and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma. The FoxO1 gene was identified in the studies of t(2, 13)(q35;q14) and t(1, 13)(p36;q14) chromosomal translocations found in rhabdomyosarcomas. The FoxO3 gene was found at t(6;11)(q21;q23) chromosomal translocation from an acute myeloid leukemia patient, while FoxO4 was present at t(x;11)(q13;q23) translocation in acute lymphoblastic leukemia [20]. Further observation indicated that the MLL-FoxO4 fusion resulted in transdominant repression of wild-type FoxO expressed from the remaining intact allele [21]. These initial findings suggest that loss-of-function of FoxOs due to gene translocations may play important roles in tumor development, even though a single allele of FoxO genes may be sufficient to prevent tumorigenesis [22].

Overexpression of FoxO inhibits tumor growth *in vitro* and tumor size *in vivo* in breast cancer, and cytoplasmic localization of FoxO correlated with poorer survival in breast cancer patients [23,24]. In contrast, nuclear localization of FoxOs suspends cell cycle progression [25], promotes apoptosis [26], and negatively regulates angiogenesis [27]. The significance of FoxO antitumoral activity is also underscored by studies conducted in leukemia [28], prostate cancer [29–31], and glioblastoma [32]. Furthermore, triple knockout mouse models proved the tumor suppressor properties of FoxOs, as mice simultaneously lacking the principal members of the mammalian FoxO subfamily, FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoxO4, are prone to develop hemangiomas and lymphoproliferative diseases [21]. Although implicated as tumor suppressors, genetic inactivation of FOXOs is rarely encountered in human cancers. Recent studies found that FoxO3 was deleted in carcinogen-induced human lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) of mice and in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines, suggesting that FoxO3 loss contributes to NSCLC pathogenesis [33,34]. FoxO3 gene was also identified as a novel target of deletion in human lung adenocarcinoma. Biallelic or homozygous deletion of FoxO3 was detected in 8 of 33 (24.2%) mostly early-stage LAC of smokers [35]. FoxOs are inactivated in the majority of human cancers, owing to the overactivation of the PI3K/Akt pathway and the latter is due to mutations in RAS, PTEN or PI3K [36]. These observations strongly define FoxOs as bona fide tumor suppressors that may be useful as therapeutic targets, although one early investigation of FoxO3 in clinical breast cancer suggested that activation of FoxO3a was intriguingly associated with lymph nodal metastasis and a poor prognosis [37].

## 3.2. FoxO-mediated suppression signaling in cell cycle

### 3.2.1. FoxO-mediated regulation of CIP/KIP family

Timely cell cycle regulation is accomplished by sequential activation of a family of serine-threonine kinases called cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs). Tight CDK regulation involves CDKIs which ensure the correct timing of CDK activation in different phases of the cell cycle [38]. Disruption of cell cycle control is a hallmark of cancer [39]. In particular, the reduced expression of the CDKI p27<sup>KIP1</sup> has been extensively observed in human cancers, and its low levels are often associated with a worse prognosis [40,41]. In quiescent cells, FoxOs are located within the nucleus in which they bind to the p27<sup>KIP1</sup> promoter and initiate transcription [25]. In response to growth factors or oncogenic signals, FoxOs are phosphorylated by Akt, resulting in their nuclear export and cytoplasmic sequestration that interferes with their nuclear transcriptional functions including p27<sup>KIP1</sup> transcription and thus promotes cell proliferation [42]. As Akt is active in many tumors, this may represent an additional mechanism to reduce p27<sup>KIP1</sup> during tumor growth. A wealth of studies to date have revealed that FoxOs target a range of genes involved in multiple cellular processes including metabolism, cell cycle, apoptosis, stress resistance, DNA repair, and immune system (Fig. 1). One of the main effects of FoxOs is to promote cell cycle arrest at the G1/S boundary by up-regulating multiple cell cycle suppressor genes such as CDKI p27<sup>KIP1</sup> [42]. In fact activation of FoxO3 is sufficient to elevate p27<sup>KIP1</sup> mRNA and protein levels, as well as to induce apoptosis [25]. FoxOs also induce cells to exit the cell cycle and enter a state of quiescence in part by upregulating levels of the retinoblastoma family member p130 [43]. Consistent with a role in driving or promoting cell cycle arrest, FoxOs were found to be incapable of inducing G1 arrest in p27<sup>KIP1</sup>/p130-deficient fibroblasts, suggesting that p27<sup>KIP1</sup> and p130 are both critical mediators of FoxO-dependent G1 arrest. Thus, p27<sup>KIP1</sup> plays a crucial role in the control of cell proliferation by inhibiting the activities of complexes of G1 cyclins and Cdks and, as such, is an important candidate for therapeutic tumor suppression.

Another FoxO target gene is CDKI p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>. Seoane et al. [32] demonstrated that the p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> promoter contains both a Smad binding region as well as a consensus forkhead binding element {FBHE; T (G/A) TT (T/G) (G/A) (T/C)} immediately upstream of the first Smad binding element (SBE) and that these features are conserved in the human and mouse genes. Further experiments showed that in response to TGFβ, FoxO1, FoxO3a, and FoxO4 bind specifically and directly to Smad3 and Smad4, and this complex targets the p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> promoter containing the FBHE and SBE to induce cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition [44]. In fact, FoxOs act as Smad partners to induce CDKIs p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p15 as part of the cytostatic response of epithelial cells [45]. More recent studies also demonstrate that CDKI p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> is an important mediator of FoxO-induced G1 arrest and subsequent quiescence. FoxO3a inhibited acute myeloid leukemia cell proliferation in part by activating transcription of the Fas-L and p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> genes, whereas IKK activity maintains FoxO3a in the cytoplasm and thus establish an important role of FoxO3a inactivation/nuclear exclusion in the proliferation and survival of AML cells [46]. Furthermore, siRNA knockdown of endogenous Sam68 (Src-associated in mitosis, 68 kDa), a nuclear RNA-binding protein that plays a role in cell growth, inhibited cell proliferation and tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells in vitro through blocking the G1 to S phase transition. However, the anti-proliferative effect of silencing Sam68 on breast cancer cells was associated with up-regulation of CDKIs p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup>, enhanced transactivation of FoxOs, and attenuation of Akt/GSK-3β signaling [47]. Thus, FoxOs play a major role in G1 arrest by upregulating cell cycle inhibitors (p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup>) and consequent attenuation of cell cycle promoting CDKs.

### 3.2.2. FoxO-mediated regulation of INK family and cyclins

FoxOs not only control cell cycle through transcription of p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>/p27<sup>KIP1</sup> genes, but also upregulate INK4 family of CDKIs such as p15 and p19. The CDKIs of INK4 family (p16, p15, p18 and p19) specifically bind to and inhibit cyclin D–CDK4/6 complexes, while the CIP/KIP family (p21, p27 and p57) of CDKIs bind to and inhibit the cyclin E–CDK2 as well as other cyclin–CDK complexes operating throughout the cell cycle [48]. Katayama et al. [49] have reported that p15 and p19 transcription was associated with FoxO-mediated G1 cell-cycle arrest. Inhibition of Akt signaling by PI3K inhibitors increased expression of CDKIs p15 and p19 but not p16 or p18. Conversely, Akt suppresses p15 and p19 expression by Akt-dependent phosphorylation and inactivation of FoxOs. Intriguingly, FoxOs can also promote cell cycle arrest by repressing cyclin D1 and D2.

the two positive regulators of cell cycle [50,51]. Additionally, forced expression of FoxO1 causes a delay in the transition from G2 to M phase, which is abrogated by overexpression of CDK1 and cyclin B1 [52]. shRNA-mediated downregulation of cathepsin B and uPAR results in G0/G1 arrest, prominent increase of p27<sup>KIP1</sup> levels and inhibition of p-Rb. This increased expression of CDKI p27<sup>KIP1</sup> correlates with decreased expression of p-PI3K, p-Akt, cyclin E, cyclin D1, cyclin D2 and increased expression of FoxO3a protein [53]. Furthermore, FoxOs also regulate expression of mitotic genes such as cyclin B and polo-like kinase (Plk) [54]. Since Plk functions in mitosis and maintenance of DNA integrity, its regulation by FoxO further highlights an important role of FoxOs in the control of mammalian cell cycle. Cyclin G2 is a newly identified homologue of cyclin G1, and in contrast to conventional cyclins, is known to induce cell cycle arrest and is up-regulated when the cells undergo cell cycle arrest or apoptosis. Cyclin G2 down-regulation has been reported in papillary carcinomas of the thyroid [55], breast [56], oral [57], and gastric cancers [58]. Modur et al. [59] found that FoxO overexpression stimulated expression of several genes including cyclin G2. FoxO-dependent upregulation of cyclin G2 is associated with PTEN-mediated transcription in an Akt-dependent as well as an Akt-independent manner [60]. Taken together, FoxOs mediate cell cycle arrest at the G1/S and G2/M transitions, two checkpoints that are critical in the cellular response to stress, by regulation of multiple cell cycle regulators [61]. FoxO-induced cell cycle arrest may allow time for repair of damaged DNA as well as for detoxification of cells.

### 3.3. FoxO/p53 crosstalk

As outlined here and in previous reviews [36,62], there are many parallels in the functions and modes of regulation of FoxOs and p53 [36]. FoxOs mediate cell cycle arrest, cell death and cellular oxidative stress to maintain metabolic stability by activating transcription of their target genes. The tumor suppressor p53 performs similar functions to enable DNA repair and to maintain genomic stability [36]. Cell-cycle arrest by FoxO and p53 occurs through inducing their target genes such as p16, p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> and p27<sup>KIP1</sup> [63]. FoxO and p53 orchestrate apoptosis through multiple mechanisms but favor the upregulation of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins. FoxOs are known to upregulate Bim and PUMA while PUMA is also transcriptionally upregulated by p53. The fact that FOXOs target a number of genes including p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup>, GADD45, WIP1 and PA26 that are also regulated by p53, suggests that FoxOs and p53 likely coordinate tumor suppression signaling [3]. Indeed available data support that FoxO and p53 function together to mediate the effects of cellular stress. In response to nutrient deprivation, FoxOs release p53-dependent repression of the Sirt1 gene, allowing the upregulation of Sirt1 expression. This repression of Sirt1 seems to be mediated by direct interaction between FoxO and p53 proteins and is independent of the presence of FoxO binding site in the Sirt1 promoter [64]. FoxO3 has also been found to interact with p53 in vitro in response to stress stimuli or to nutrient deprivation [65]. Intriguing examples that further show the overlapping functions of FoxO and p53 are derived from studies in transgenic mice. Mice that lack p53 develop normally, but are remarkably predisposed to developing broad spectrum of cancers including thymic lymphoma and hemangioma, and usually die from these malignancies within 3–6 months of birth [66,67]. Similarly, conditional triple knockout mice lacking FOXOs (FoxO1, 3a, and 4) are prone to develop hemangiomas and thymic lymphoma. On the other hand, the individual or paired inactivation of FoxO1, FoxO3a or FoxO4 was found to cause a less severe phenotype [22]. These observations suggest that FoxO and p53 play similar roles at least in suppressing tumorigenesis by overlapping modes of target gene regulation. Overall, FoxO3 together with partners including p53 provide a strong tumor suppressor network to protect cells from damage to the DNA and thus play an important role in maintaining genomic stability to prevent clonal emergence and expansion.

## 4. FoxO and apoptosis

According to Yin Yang theory, all matter consists of two sides. Yin is the negative side, and Yang is the positive side. The coexistence of the two sides in equilibrium and/or harmony is considered a key for the overall health of a biological system. Consistent with this theory, gain-and loss-of-function models of genes in the core apoptotic pathway suggest that perturbation of cellular homeostasis can be a primary pathogenic event that results in disease. Indeed, there is now compelling evidence that insufficient apoptosis can manifest as cancer or autoimmunity, whereas accelerated cell death contributes to acute and chronic degenerative diseases [68].

Factors regulating the expression levels of survival proteins are likely to play a crucial role in tumor formation. For example, aberrant overactivation of PI3K/Akt signaling is a hallmark of many human cancers. One major way by which PI3K/Akt promotes cell survival is through sequestering FoxOs away from the promoters of apoptotic genes. FoxOs therefore have emerged as an important effector arm of PI3K/Akt signaling by driving multiple apoptotic gene expression [3].

### 4.1. FoxO-upregulated BH3-only proteins

Conventionally, apoptosis occurs via two main pathways: the intrinsic pathway mediated by mitochondria, resulting in the activation of caspase 9 while the extrinsic pathway is mediated by the activation of death receptors (Fas and TNFR) and involves the activation of caspase 8 [69,70]. The BCL-2 family of proteins are well-characterized regulators of apoptosis and are grouped into three subfamilies based on the number of BH (BCL-2 homology) domains they share [71]. The BH3-only group consists of pro-apoptotic proteins including BIK, EGL-1, Bim, BMF, NOXA, BID, BAD, BNIP3, PUMA and Beclin-1. Initial investigations indicate that the expression of constitutively nuclear forms of FoxOs trigger cell death in different types of cells which involves transactivation of at least two members of pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins (Bim and BNIP3) [72–75]. FoxOs induce Bim expression in hematopoietic cells deprived of growth factors [74,75]. Overexpression of a FoxO3a mutant that cannot be phosphorylated by Akt results in apoptosis of BCR-ABL-transformed cells [76]. Treatment with proteasome inhibitor, bortezomib, also reduces the burden of BCR-ABL-induced leukemic disease by restoration of normal FoxO3a expression, and prolonged survival of BCR-ABL-transduced mice [77]. SYUNZ-16, a new derivative of alkannin that induces apoptosis is associated with an increase in the nuclear accumulation of exogenous FoxO protein, and upregulation of the mRNA expression of Bim and TRADD in liver cancer cells [78]. In paclitaxel-sensitive breast cancer, upregulation of FoxO3a induced by paclitaxel causes increased levels of Bim mRNA and protein, leading to apoptosis and thus contribute to tumor suppression by paclitaxel [79]. PUMA is a potent regulator of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, attributing to two distinct mechanisms which both rely on PUMA binding to the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 proteins: derepression and sensitization [80]. FOXO3a is responsible for the transcriptional upregulation of Puma in response to cytokine or growth factor deprivation [81], indicating that FoxO-induced transcription of PUMA may play a role in regulation of apoptosis and stress response [82]. Furthermore, FoxO4 indirectly suppresses the expression of the pro-survival Bcl-2 family member Bcl-XL by regulating expression of the transcriptional repressor Bcl-6 [83]. Thus, FoxOs can induce cell death through the intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by mitochondria.

### 4.2. FoxO-mediated extrinsic apoptotic pathway

As described in Fig. 1, FoxO directly regulates the extrinsic apoptotic pathway through enhancing the transcription of proapoptotic factors such as FasL and TRAIL. The FasL promoter contains three FBHEs, and Foxo3a-induced apoptosis of cerebellar neurons is decreased when Fas/FasL interaction is blocked by the decoy fusion1982

protein Fas-Fc. Overexpression of a constitutively active form of FoxO3 triggers apoptosis in cerebellar granule neurons through the Fas signaling cascade [84]. IKK-insensitive FoxO3a protein mutated at S644 translocated into the nucleus and activated the transcription of the Fas-L and CDKI p21<sup>WAF1/CIP1</sup> genes. This in turn inhibited leukemic cell proliferation and induced apoptosis [46]. In addition, over-expression of FoxO1 and FoxO3 in the prostate cancer cells results in apoptosis and increased expression of TRAIL. FoxO3 DNA-binding elements exist in the TRAIL promoter, indicating that TRAIL is a direct target of FoxO3 [59]. Exposure of human hepatic stellate cells to TRAIL led to dephosphorylation and nuclear accumulation of FoxO1 and FoxO3a. Activation of FoxOs consequently promoted TRAIL-induced apoptosis in LX-2 cells [85]. Active FoxO4 antagonized deregulated proliferation and induced apoptosis in chronic myelogenous leukemia-derived cell lines. Imatinib-resistant cells underwent apoptosis after transfection with full-length TRAIL cDNA. These results suggest that active FoxO4 can overcome imatinib resistance in CML cells via TRAIL production [86]. It is worth noting that highly selective expression of FoxO target genes has been observed in different cell lines and treatment, suggesting that transcriptional targets of FoxOs are tissue- and stimulus-specific. For example, HIV infection of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to induction of FoxO3a, which modulates multiple target genes that are critical to the G<sub>0</sub> cell cycle entry observed in the infected cells and are active players in both the extrinsic and the intrinsic pathways of apoptosis [87]. However, the precise mechanisms are unclear. Taken together, FoxO proteins regulate cell death by modulating the expression of BH3-only proteins (Bim and BNIP3) and death receptor ligands (FasL and TRAIL) that function in autocrine and paracrine pathways.

### 4.3. PTEN/FoxO axis in apoptosis

The PTEN tumor suppressor was discovered by its homozygous deletion and other mutations following mapping of the human chromosome 10q23 in cancer [88]. Sequencing of the PTEN gene in tumors found it to be one of the most commonly mutated tumor suppressors in human malignancies. Thus PTEN signaling is almost universally altered in cancer [88]. Analysis of PTEN deficient hematopoietic system revealed that conditional ablation of PTEN drives exit from quiescence through PI3K/Akt hyperactivation, and leads to exhaustion of normal hematopoietic stem cells while at the same time initiating acute leukemia [89]. Interestingly, mice with FoxO deletions never develop AML, suggesting that the repression of FoxO activity by Akt is not sufficient for leukemogenesis, although other types of malignancies develop in these mice [22,90]. This suggests that alternative or additional downstream targets of Akt are required for leukemic transformation. PTEN is a major negative regulator of the PI3K-Akt pathway. In cells that carry the PTEN mutation, the PI3K pathway is often constitutively active, leading to inactivation of endogenous FoxOs and possible initiation and progression of tumors [91]. Phosphorylation-dependent nuclear/cytoplasmic shuttling of FoxOs is mainly regulated by Akt and PTEN. FoxO phosphorylation by Akt results in sequestration of FoxOs in the cytoplasm and inhibition of target gene transcription. FoxO dephosphorylation leads to nuclear translocation and target gene activation [92]. Since PTEN is a FoxO target gene, FoxOs can enhance transcription of PTEN to positively reinforce their biological function of tumor suppression. Therefore, restoring nuclear expression of FoxOs and their target genes may provide an important therapeutic approach for targeted cancer therapy.

## 5. Targeting AKT-FoxO signaling axis

Based on tumor suppressor properties of FoxOs, their reactivation is considered an attractive anti-cancer strategy. In contrast to other tumor suppressors such as p53 or PTEN, the functions of which are abrogated by genetic or epigenetic changes, inactivation of FoxOs occurs mostly because of the overactivation of their inhibitory signaling [36]. This offers a wide range of possibilities for rescuing FoxO activity with two major strategies: 1) reactivation of FoxO and its regulators; 2) targeting PI3K/ Akt/mTOR axis.

### 5.1. Reactivation of FoxO and its regulators

#### 5.1.1. Restoration of FoxO gene expression

Since a hallmark of most cancers is the inactivation of FoxO by PI3K-dependent phosphorylation and hyperactivation of PI3K/Akt pathway that controls many biological functions such as cell proliferation, survival, and insulin response, reactivation of FoxO may be an invaluable therapeutic approach. Kau et al. [93] have employed a cell-based, chemical genetics approach to search for compounds that trap FoxO1 in the nucleus by modulating FoxO's dynamic nucleocytoplasmic shuttling. Two classes of compounds that inhibit FoxO1a nuclear export were identified: (1) compounds that target the general nuclear transport machinery and (2) compounds specific to targeting the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1a signaling pathway. They have shown that 19 of the compounds that promoted retention of FoxO1a in the nucleus were novel general protein export inhibitors. All 19 compounds blocked the nuclear export of RevGFP and FoxO1a by targeting CRM1, and not by inhibition of other factors in the nuclear transport machinery [93]. There were 23 small molecule inhibitors of FoxO1a that acted in the PI3K/Akt/FoxO1a signaling pathway. Importantly, some of these inhibitors were able to suppress cellular proliferation of PTEN-deficient 786-0 cells, even though they displayed IC50 values in the micromolar range [93]. Analyzing these FoxO1 nuclear export inhibitors may not only yield a new class of anti-cancer therapies, but may also provide novel regulators of the PI3-K, Akt and FoxO pathways.

Phosphorylation of FoxO factors by Akt triggers the rapid relocalization of FoxOs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Akt phosphorylates FoxOs at three key regulatory sites (Thr32, Ser253, and Ser315 in the FoxO3 sequence) that are conserved from Caenorhabditis elegans to mammals and are part of a perfect consensus sequence for Akt phosphorylation [91]. Based on this feature of FoxOs, another strategy could be to mutate the three well-characterized Akt phosphorylation sites on FoxOs to alanine. This AAA FoxO mutant can no longer undergo phosphorylation and will accumulate in the nucleus, allowing reconstitution of FoxO activity in the PTEN null cells. Indeed, overexpression of Foxo1 or Foxo3a triple AAA mutant by adenovirus-mediated gene transfer inhibited cell growth by inducing cell cycle arrest in sub-G1 phase, and subsequently apoptotic cell death, as evident by typical apoptotic morphologic changes, annexin V-PE analysis, and caspase cascade activation in melanoma [94] and endometrial cancer [95]. These data suggest that adenovirus expressing a FoxO triple mutant could be a useful vector for gene therapy of cancers resistant to chemotherapy and radiotherapy induced by hyperactivity of PI3K/Akt.

It has been shown that the some cancer therapeutic drugs activate FoxOs by attenuating Akt activity. In paclitaxel-sensitive MCF-7 breast cancer cells, up-regulation of FoxO3a by paclitaxel can cause increased levels of Bim mRNA and protein, resulting in apoptosis. Silencing of FoxO3a by small interfering RNA greatly reduces the induction of apoptosis caused by paclitaxel [79]. Furthermore, paclitaxel not only induces FoxO3a expression but also enhances its nuclear relocation through JNK-dependent inhibition of the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, suggesting a crosstalk between the PI3K-Akt-FoxO3a and JNK signaling pathways [96]. Phosphorylation of FoxO3a by JNK reduces the interaction between FoxO3a with 14-3-3 protein, leading to impaired nuclear export of FoxO3a, and thereby stimulating FoxO3a activity [96]. KP372-1 (a multiple kinase inhibitor) also inhibits pathways critical for acute myeloid leukemia survival, including PDK1/Akt and FLT3 through activation of FoxO activity [97]. In addition, selenium (a chemopreventive agent), which significantly reduces the incidence of prostate cancer, upregulatesFoxO1 expression when compared to gene expression profile of a control group [98]. Further analysis demonstrates that FoxO1 activation is critical for the anticancer effects of methylseleninic acid in prostate cancer cells [99]. Since androgens provide an Akt-independent cell survival signal in prostate cancer cells, FoxO transcription factors therefore are important nuclear targets for both Akt-dependent and -independent survival signals in prostate cancer cells [100]. Thus restoring FoxO activity by different approaches can be beneficial for cancer treatment and cancer prevention.

### 5.1.2. Restoration of PTEN gene expression by targeting miRNA

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short non-protein-coding RNAs (~22 nucleotide) that are known to alter gene expression at a post-transcriptional level [101,102]. Over 1200 validated human miRNAs have been discovered to date ([http://www.mirbase.org](http://www.mirbase.org)), and they are predicted to regulate one third of the human genome with involvement in development and progression of many diseases [103–105]. miRNA overexpression has been shown to be indicative of invasion and chemoresistance through two mechanisms. The first is by increased cell proliferation and decreased expression of programmed cell death 4 (PDCD4). The second mechanism is by repression of the tumor suppressor PTEN in non-small cell lung cancer, which is involved in regulation of cell growth and invasion [106]. Several miRNAs have been shown to function as oncogenic miRNAs (onco-Mirs) due to the fact that they target transcripts encoding key regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis such as PTEN and PDCD4 [107,108]. The PTEN mRNA has an unusual, about 3.3 kb long 3′ untranslated region (UTR) that is suggestive of tight post-transcriptional control of PTEN expression. Adding to the complexity of PTEN regulation, recent evidence further indicated that the PTEN mRNA undergoes post-transcriptional repression/degradation by specific miRNAs. Within the PTEN 3′UTR are several conserved miRNA target sites, and PTEN has been shown to be repressed by a variety of miRNAs derived from miRNA precursors containing a single hairpin structure such as miR-19a, 21, 22, 26a, 214, 216a, 217, 221, 222, and 494, as well as those with a polycistronic structure, such as mir-17–92, mir-106b-25, mir-367-302b, and mir-221-222 [107,109–116]. Emerging evidence also indicates that aberrant expression of miRNAs is highly linked to chemoresistance to cancer therapeutic drugs such as Her2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab and the anti-estrogen tamoxifen [106]. Therefore, antisense oligonucleotides targeted to oncoMirs represents a potential new approach for cancer therapy as well as a solution for chemoresistance via restoration of depressed intracellular PTEN levels [115,117–120].

#### 5.2. Targeting PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis

Given the central role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway in tumorigenesis, its inhibition seems a powerful approach to induce anti-tumor activity. Akt is a core player in PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis activated through phosphorylation of Ser–473/474 and Thr-308/309 [94]. Targeting the upstream regulators or downstream effectors of Akt is one strategy to identify new targets for drug discovery. More than 100 lead compounds targeting multiple nodes of PI3K signaling, including PI3K, Akt, mTOR, etc., are in the preclinical drug-development pipeline so far [121,122], and a growing number of promising agents continually enter intensive phase I, II, and III clinical trials ([http://www.clinicaltrials.gov](http://www.clinicaltrials.gov)). PTEN is the key antagonist of the PI3K/Akt pathway. Loss of PTEN in many types of cancer is associated not only with tumor development but also with clinical resistance to many anticancer drugs. Thus, targeting key components of PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis is a desirable means to overcome PTEN functional loss and consequent restoration of FoxO function.

Wortmannin and LY294002 are well-known PI3K inhibitors that have been widely used as research tools to elucidate the role of PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling in various tumor cells. Unfortunately, high cytotoxicity of both inhibitors precluded their clinical application. Nonetheless, several inhibitors of PI3K have moved through preclinical studies and into

phase I and II clinical trials [123]. These range from inhibitors reported to act on a single class I PI3K such CAL-101, to inhibitors of multiple class I PI3K isoforms such as PX-866, XL-147, and GDC-0941, and to inhibitors acting on multiple class I isoforms and other PIK family members such as BEZ235 and XL765 [123]. Overall, there is limited clinical benefit with inhibitors of PI3K. The development of such inhibitors raises issues as to what specific member or members in the PI3K family should be inhibited to achieve maximal therapeutic benefit, and can specific inhibitors be developed with the necessary pharmacologic properties to allow them to proceed to clinical trials? The question also remains to be answered whether greater therapeutic efficacy will be obtained through the use of inhibitors with increased specificity, or through inhibitors that act on a spectrum of targets within the pathway [124].

To date, several types of Akt inhibitors have been investigated, including phosphatidylinositol analog inhibitors, allosteric Akt kinase inhibitors, ATP-competitive inhibitors, and alkylphospholipids [125,126]. However, the use of these inhibitors is limited either by high toxicity or by low bioavailability and stability in vivo, even though several agents (e.g., perifosine, MK-2206, RX-0201, PBI-05204, GSK2141795) have been in various stages of clinical testing [127]. Severe side effects of Akt inhibitors may be due to the critical role of Akt in multiple intracellular processes [128].

The most studied target in PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway is mTOR. Four drugs that target mTOR have been explored for clinical use: rapamycin, temsirolimus, everolimus and deforolimus [129,130]. In patients with advanced breast cancer, these inhibitors have modest anticancer activity in the range of around 10% because of collateral effect of these inhibitors on feed-back activation of Akt and PI3K [131,132]. To date, with the exception of kidney cancer, mTOR inhibitors have failed to inhibit tumor progression in a variety of cancers [133,134]. Since there is a crosstalk between the estrogen receptor and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, clinical trials have explored the combination of mTOR inhibitors and aromatase inhibitors. Recent data show that everolimus in combination of letrozole proved to be superior over letrozole alone with a significant response rate (68% vs. 59%) in the patients with ER positive breast cancers [130]. Although molecular targeting of tumor-specific signal transduction pathways is a promising strategy for discovering and developing novel and potent anticancer drugs, evolution of our knowledge of the PI3K/Akt/FoxO pathway will serve as an important guide in design of future anti-cancer agents with maximal efficacy and minimal side effects.

### 6. Conclusions

FoxO transcription factors are emerging as key regulators of cell growth. Their ability to limit cell proliferation by promoting quiescence, apoptosis, or both plays a critical role in a variety of physiological and pathological processes including tumor suppression. FoxOs are one of the major targets of the PI3K/Akt signaling in the presence of growth factors and nutrients. Activation of the PI3K pathway promotes phosphorylation, and consequent nuclear exclusion of the FoxOs results in blockage of their growth inhibitory transcriptional functions. Since growth inhibitory functions of FoxOs involve activation of several proteins that include inhibitors of cell cycle, retinoblastoma protein, inducers of extrinsic as well as intrinsic apoptosis, and interactions with tumor suppressors such as p53, restoring activities of FoxOs therefore is an excellent anti-cancer strategy. Indeed, over-expression of phosphorylation-deficient FoxO mutants has provided a proof-of-principle approach for suppression of cell growth. Although FoxOs are known to function in a tissue and context-dependent manner, and functional redundancy exists among the FoxOs, identification of small molecule compounds that selectively target one or multiple FoxOs and promote their nuclear retention or inhibit their nuclear export nevertheless offer excellent opportunities for cancer-related drug design. Furthermore, as Akt-dependent
phosphorylation promotes nuclear exclusion and degradation of FoxOs, pharmacologic targeting of the PI3K-Akt pathway in combination with strategies that promote nuclear retention of FoxOs have the potential to be superior in targeting a range of inflammation-associated pathologies including cancer.
