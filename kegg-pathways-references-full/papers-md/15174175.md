The carbapenem subfamily of β-lactam antibiotics are medically useful as they possess a broad spectrum of activity and display resistance to inactivation by “serine” β-lactamases.[1] Unusually for β-lactam antibiotics they are produced by total synthesis and, consequently, their production costs are relatively high compared to those antibiotics produced by fermentation. Gene clusters encoding the enzymes involved in carbapenem production have now been identified,[2–4] and their manipulation may enable an efficient route to carbapenems or useful intermediates. More than ten genes are proposed to be involved in the biosynthesis of the C2- and C6-functionalised carbapenems, such as thienamycin;[3] however, only three proteins, encoded by the carA, carB and carC genes, are directly responsible for the biosynthesis of the simplest carbapenem, (5R)-1-carbapen-2-em-3-carboxylate ((5R)-carbapenem, 1, Scheme 1).[2,5]

Carbapenem synthase (CarC) is a ferrous and 2-oxoglutarate-dependent enzyme that catalyses the highly unusual epimerisation and desaturation of the (3S,5S)-carbapenam 2 to give the (3S,5R)-carbapenam 3 and the (5R)-carbapenem 1.[6] The conversion of 2 to 1 via 3 is reminiscent of the sequential oxidation and desaturation reactions catalysed by clavaminic acid synthase (another 2-oxoglutarate (20G) oxygenase) in the biosynthesis of clavulanic acid.[7,8] However in the latter case, each of the reactions encompasses a two-electron oxidation, while with CarC only a single two-electron oxidation is required to go directly from 2 to 1 (Scheme 1). The epimerisation reaction, proposed to be mediated by an FeIV=O species,[9] has little or no precedent in synthetic chemistry. Furthermore, loss of label from the C5 position[10] in the conversion of 2 to 3 appears to support a direct abstraction process.

The stereochemistry of the antibiotic 1 and the (3S,5R)-carbapenam 3 from *Pectobacterium carotovora* and *Serratia marcescens* have been unequivocally established.[11] After some confusion, the assignment for the natural carbapenam substrate [(3S,5S)-carbapenam 2] has been confirmed.[10,12,13] Studies with CarC have employed either the synthetic (3S,5S)-carbapenam 2, or the same stereoisomer produced in situ from a monocyclic (5-carboxymethyl)-proline (CMP, 4) precursor by coupling of the CarA (carbapenam synthetase) and CarC reactions.[9,10,14] In order to further investigate the mechanism of the unusual transformation of 2 to 1 (Scheme 1), we report here the results of incubating all four possible carbapenam stereoisomers with CarC.

The trans-carbapenam (3S,5S)-2 and its enantiomer (3R,5R)-5 were prepared as reported, by following a route in which the construction of the pyrrolidine ring was achieved by a thermodynamically controlled intramolecular Michael reaction step (Scheme 2a).[12] This route was optimised for the preparation of the trans-stereoisomers with a trans/cis ratio of about 11:1, but is not convenient for the preparation of the cis stereoisomers. An alternative route was therefore developed for the cis stereoisomers and exemplified for the (3R,5S) stereoisomer 6 (Scheme 2 b). Following preparation of keto-diester 10 from pyroglutamate, the key step was a one-pot Z deprotection followed by intramolecular reductive amination[15] (trans/cis, ca. 1:3).

Optical-rotation measurements of the carbapenam methyl esters were consistent with the production of all four carbapenam stereoisomers: (3S,5S)-2, [α]D25 = −194.0° (c = 0.30 in CHCl₃), lit. [α]D24 = −198.5° (c = 0.50 in CHCl₃); (3R,5R)-5, [α]D21 = +203.0° (c = 0.25 in CHCl₃), lit. [α]D25 = +198.0° (c = 0.64 in CHCl₃); (3S,5R)-3, [α]D25 = +123.0° (c = 0.25 in CHCl₃), lit. [α]D24 = +87.0° (c = 0.41 in CHCl₃); (3R,5S)-6, [α]D21 = −92.4° (c = 0.30 in CHCl₃), lit. [α]D24 = −87.7° (c = 0.28 in CHCl₃).[13,16] The observed [α]D21 value for 3 was higher than expected; this suggested contamination of 3 by 5. ¹H NMR analysis indeed revealed the presence of <5% of 5; however, since 5 is a poorer substrate than 3, the order of reactivity should not be significantly affected.

Each of the four stereoisomers was incubated separately with CarC in the presence of FeII and 20G. The formation of carbapenem product was assayed for by HPLC/MS (carbapenam 152 Da [M−H]⁻, carbapenam 154 Da [M−H]⁻) and bioassay. It was assumed that the production of a zone of antibiosis reflected production of the (5R)-carbapenem 1; precedent suggests it is unlikely that the (5S)-carbapenem is bioactive,[17] but this cannot be entirely ruled out.

Care must be taken in comparing results from the stopped assays (the instability and scarcity of the bicyclic β-lactams coupled with the poor activity of CarC rendered continuous assays difficult and precluded analysis of the optical purity of the products). However, the same trend was observed upon repeat analyses and was observed by HPLC monitoring of carbapenem production (λmax = 261 nm in the absence of ascorbate). The following trends were observed in the presence of ascorbate (1 mM): 2 > 3 > 5 > 6 and in the absence of ascorbate 3 > 5 > 6 > 2 (Table 1). The results for the assigned natural substrate of CarC, (3S,5S) stereoisomer 2 in the presence of ascorbate, were supportive of previous reports that it is a substrate for CarC. However, the (3S,5R)-carbapenam 3 was clearly a better in vitro substrate in the absence of ascorbate. Since this stereoisomer is also produced in vivo (Scheme 1), it is pos-

cycles) one role for it has been proposed to be rescuing the enzyme from potential oxidation damage due to an “inadvertently” produced FeIV=O intermediate.[18] Another possible role for ascorbate (or a bacterial equivalent) with CarC is mediating the supply of the hydrogen (possibly from water) to the C5 position of 1 during the epimerisation process. Since the conversion of (3S,5S)-carbapenam 2 to (5R)-carbapenem 1 requires only a single two-electron oxidation, it would seem most efficient for CarC to catalyse epimerisation/desaturation in a single coupled process. Crystallographic analysis of CarC complexed with FeII and 2OG has indicated that different active-site orientations are required for the desaturation/epimerisation steps.[9] Thus, subsequent to or during epimerisation, it may be that during some catalytic cycles the (3S,5R) stereoisomer 3, or an intermediate can “leak” from the active site as a shunt metabolite leaving a reactive FeIV=O intermediate (Scheme 3). Ascorbate can then serve to reduce this reactive intermediate to FeII, as proposed for other 2OG oxygenases, and desaturation of the (3S,5R) stereoisomer 3 can then occur in a new reaction cycle. Ascorbate did not stimulate turnover of the (3S,5R)-3 or (3R,5R)-5 stereoisomers; perhaps this reflects the fact that they do not need to be epimerised. Under the assay conditions, ascorbate appeared to be a weak inhibitor of the (3R,5R)-5 and (3R,5S)-6 stereoisomers, possibly due to competition with these unnatural substrates, although some inhibition of the (3S,5R) stereoisomer 3 was also observed. There is no evidence for ascorbate production in bacteria, but other small-molecule reducing agents have been identified (e.g. mycothiol[19]), and it is reasonable to suppose that bacteria possess a mechanism for reducing protein-bound FeIV/III to FeII.

Interestingly CarA, the enzyme prior to CarC in the pathway, has been shown to convert three of the four monocyclic pyrro-

Labelling studies show that the hydrogen that is abstracted from C5 is not returned.[10] In the Scheme, the source of the C5 hydrogen of 1 is shown as coming from the enzyme though its origin and the fate of the hydrogen removed are not known (see text).

lidine carboxylate stereoisomers to carbapenams (the (2R,5S) stereoisomer 8 was not tested) in the following order of preference ($k_{\text{cat}}/K_{\text{m}}$ (mm⁻¹s⁻¹) in parentheses); (2S,5S)-CMP 4 (1.2 ± 0.1), (2S,5R)-CMP 7 (0.027 ± 0.003), (2R,5R)-CMP 9 (0.026 ± 0.001). [14] This order of preference approximately echoes that seen for CarC in the presence of ascorbate. Assuming that the (3R,5R)- and (3R,5S)-carbapenams (5 and 6), which have not been isolated, do not occur in bacteria (at least in the species so far studied), these observations combined with the present study mean that the stereochemical course of the pathway is ultimately directed by the selectivity of CarB, that is, it is predicted that CarB uses an L(S) rather than a D(R) amino acid as its preferred substrate.

The observation that the (3S,5S) stereoisomer 2 is not the only carbapenam substrate for CarC, coupled to the lack of selectivity of CarA, means that it might be possible to construct a carbapenem biosynthesis pathway that does not involve C5 epimerisation via modification of CarB to produce a product with the (5R) stereochemistry (corresponding to 5R at C5 in the carbapenam).

### Experimental Section

CarC was purified as reported previously.[9] Solutions (100 mM) of free carbapenams were prepared from their methyl esters by enzymatic hydrolysis in phosphate buffer (pH 8) by using pig-liver esterase (PLE) on Eupergit® resin.[20]

**Bioassay:** Assay mixtures were transferred into holed (11 mm diameter) bioassay plates (*E. coli* X580) and incubated at 28°C overnight. A typical assay mixture consisted of KPi, pH 7.6 (20 mM), 2-oxoglutarate (5 mM), carbapenam (2 mM), CarC (1.6 mg mL⁻¹) and FeSO₄ (1 mM). Where L-ascorbate was present, it was at 1 mM. The assay mixture was incubated at 23°C for 30 min.

**HPLC/MS:** HPLC/MS was performed by using a Waters high-performance liquid chromatography system connected to a Micro-Mass ZMD mass spectrometer in the negative ion mode. Additional detection with a Waters 966 PDA at 261 nm was employed for assays without ascorbate. Assay mixtures as for the bioassays were mixed with CH₃CN (equal volume), chilled on ice for 5 min and then separated in a centrifuge (17800 g) for 5 min before analysis. Controls were carried out under identical conditions, but with CarC omitted. The assay mixture (100 μL) was injected onto a Synergy Polar-RP column (250 × 4.6 mm, Phenomenex) equilibrated in 5% CH₃CN at 1 mL min⁻¹. After 15 min, a gradient to 90% CH₃CN was run over 5 min. These conditions were maintained for 5 min before returning to 5% CH₃CN over 5 min and re-equilibration for 10 min.

**Notes added in proof:** i) Since submission of this manuscript, an article has been published also describing turnover of (3S,5R)-carbapenam-3-carboxylic acid by CarC.[21]

ii) Malonyl CoA rather than acetyl CoA has been reported to be a substrate for CarB.[22]
