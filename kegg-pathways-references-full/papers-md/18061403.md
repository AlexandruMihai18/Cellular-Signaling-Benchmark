### Abstract

Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) is a central second messenger controlling a plethora of vital functions. Studies of cAMP dynamics in living cells have revealed markedly inhomogeneous concentrations of the second messenger in different compartments. Moreover, cAMP effectors such as cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) and cAMP-activated GTP-exchange factors (Epacs) are tethered to specific cellular sites. Both the tailoring of cAMP concentrations, and the activities of cAMP-dependent signalling systems at specific cellular locations are prerequisites for most, if not all, cAMP-dependent processes. This review focuses on the role of compartmentalized cAMP signalling in exocytic processes in non-neuronal cells. Particularly, the insertion of aquaporin-2 into the plasma membrane of renal principal cells as an example for a cAMP-dependent exocytic process in a non-secretory cell type, renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells as a cAMP-triggered exocytosis from an endocrine cell, insulin release from pancreatic β-cells as a Ca²⁺-mediated and cAMP-potentiated exocytic processes in an endocrine cell, and cAMP- or Ca²⁺-triggered H⁺ secretion from gastric parietal cells as an exocytic process in an exocrine cell are discussed. The selected examples of cAMP-regulated exocytic pathways are reviewed with regard to key proteins involved: adenylyl cyclases, phosphodiesterases, PKA, A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) and Epacs.

### 1. Introduction

Exocytic events involve multiple steps, including the trafficking of exocytic vesicles along cytoskeletal elements, docking to secretory sites, priming of docked vesicles and eventually fusion with the plasma membrane [1,2]. Two types of exocytosis are distinguishable. Constitutive exocytosis, occurring in all cell types, facilitates continuous incorporation of newly synthesized proteins and lipids into the plasma membrane and secretion of vesicular contents. Regulated exocytosis on the other hand is based on the presence of intracellular vesicles, which fuse with the plasma membrane in response to a stimulus. The molecular mechanisms underlying regulated exocytosis have been mostly elucidated from studies of neuronal exocytosis but regulated exocytic events occur also in a variety of non-neuronal cell types (Table 1). Regulated exocytic events control numerous vital functions. For example, the release of transmitters from neurons upon plasma membrane depolarisation permits transmission of information through the nervous system; insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells in response to elevation of blood glucose regulates glucose uptake from the blood into target cells; secretion of H⁺ from gastric parietal cells, stimulated by histamine and other stimuli such as acetylcholine and gastrin, aids digestion; renin, secreted from renal juxtaglomerular cells in response to a decrease in blood pressure increases blood pressure; the vasopressin (AVP)-mediated redistribution of the water channel aquaporin-2 (AQP2) from intracellular vesicles into the plasma membrane of renal principal cells dramatically increases water reabsorption of the renal collecting duct and thereby fine tunes body water homeostasis. The functional implications of regulated exocytic processes are underpinned by the diseases their dysregulation may cause: mental disorders such as schizophrenia, cardiovascular disease such as hypertension, diabetes mellitus, gastric ulcers or diabetes insipidus [3–8].

All stimuli of regulated exocytic events induce the formation of second messengers such as cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), or their release from intracellular stores as in the case of Ca²⁺ release from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol (Table 1). Ca²⁺ may also enter the cells through other routes, for example via voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels or Ca²⁺ release-activated Ca²⁺ channels (CRACs) located in the plasma membrane [9]. Whereas Ca²⁺ is the principal trigger of neurotransmitter release, both Ca²⁺ and cAMP may stimulate exocytic processes in non-neuronal cells [2]. Generally, cAMP and Ca²⁺ influence each others actions [10], whereby cAMP seems to almost always enhance Ca²⁺-triggered exocytic processes as in the case of insulin secretion (Table 1) [11]. A classical example of a solely cAMP-triggered exocytosis is renin secretion. It is inhibited by Ca²⁺ [12]. A second example of a cAMP-stimulated exocytic event is the redistribution of AQP2 into the plasma membrane of renal principal cells [13]. An example for an exocytosis where the two second messengers may act as alternative triggers and either one may enhance the secretion stimulated by the other is H⁺ secretion in gastric parietal cells [14].

Independent of the trigger (Ca²⁺ or cAMP), all cells utilize similar vesicle transport and fusion machineries at all stages of vesicular trafficking. For example, various isoforms of SNAREs induce fusion of membranes in all types of cells [1,15]. Differences between Ca²⁺ and cAMP-triggered exocytic events arise from the different types of their respective primary effectors. Ca²⁺ promotes vesicle-plasma membrane fusion by binding to the catalytically inactive synaptotagmin. Complexin interacts with the SNARE complex, and thereby forms a clamp preventing fusion of insulin-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane under resting conditions. The binding of Ca²⁺ to synaptotagmin releases the clamp by dissociating complexin [16]. Cyclic AMP

activates mainly PKA and Epacs, which consequently modulate activities of their effectors [17–19] (see below).

Ca²⁺ and cAMP are readily diffusible. Taking into account the numerous processes they control, often at the same time in the same cell, specificity in their action is only conceivable, if their diffusion is limited. Indeed, the levels of both Ca²⁺ and cAMP are under dynamic temporal and spatial control [10,20].

Cyclic AMP is generated by adenylyl cyclases in response to stimulation of seven transmembrane receptors coupled to the stimulatory G-protein, Gₛ. It is degraded by phosphodiesterases (PDEs), warranting termination of signalling. The localization and regulated activities of the different isoforms of adenylyl cyclases and PDEs in defined cellular compartments establishes cAMP gradients [5,21–23].

The major effectors of cAMP in regulated exocytic processes are PKA and Epac [24]. PKA consists of a dimer of regulatory (R) subunits each of which is associated with a catalytic subunit. Binding of two molecules of cAMP to each R subunit releases the catalytic subunits, which in the free form phosphorylate their substrates at consensus sites [19,25]. PKA is anchored to cellular locations such as the cytoskeleton, plasma membranes and exocytic vesicles through direct interaction of its R subunit dimer with A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) [26–28]. AKAPs contain a structurally conserved binding domain for R subunits of PKA, an amphipathic helix, and a targeting domain that is unique to each AKAP [29,30]. Currently, approximately 70 proteins are classified as AKAPs by virtue of their R subunit binding ability. It is estimated that cells express at least 13 different AKAPs simultaneously. AKAPs tether PKA in close proximity to its substrates. Some AKAPs directly interact with substrates of the AKAP-bound PKA. AKAPs are not simple PKA anchors facilitating spatially and temporally regulated cAMP/PKA signalling. They also may act as scaffolds by binding PDEs and protein phosphatases terminating PKA signalling, the former by hydrolysis of cAMP and the latter by dephosphorylating PKA substrates. In addition, AKAPs may interact with adenylyl cyclases, Epacs, and further scaffolding proteins [31–33]. Furthermore, AKAPs bind proteins involved in signalling pathways, which are activated by second messengers other than cAMP (e.g. Ca²⁺) such as protein kinase C (PKC) [34,35]. Therefore, AKAPs play a key role in compartmentalization of cAMP-dependent signalling and in integrating signals arising from other pathways.

Epacs exist in two isoforms, Epac1 and Epac2 [36,37]. They are multidomain, monomeric guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2, and are activated by cAMP. Both isoforms contain a Dishevelled, Egl-10, pleckstrin homology (DEP) membrane targeting domain. By virtue of the membrane targeting and their ability to interact with other signalling proteins Epacs direct cAMP signalling to specific cellular sites in pancreatic β-cells and play a central role in cAMP signalling in insulin secretion [37]. Epac may also play a role in other exocytic processes [38].

This review focuses on the role of compartmentalization of cAMP-dependent signalling pathways in exocytic processes in non-neuronal cells. In particular, the AQP2 redistribution as an example of an exocytic mechanism in non-secretory cells, renin

and insulin secretion as examples for exocytoses from endocrine cells, and H⁺ release as an example for a mechanism taking place in exocrine cells are discussed.

## 2. cAMP-dependent exocytic processes

### 2.1. Insertion of AQP2 into the plasma membrane of renal principal cells

A major task of principal cells lining renal collecting ducts is the fine-tuning of body water homeostasis by controlling water reabsorption. In order to accomplish this, they express water-permeable channel proteins in their plasma membranes, the aquaporins (AQP) [39]. While AQP3 and AQP4 are constitutively expressed in the basolateral plasma membrane, the localization of AQP2 is subject to regulation by AVP [13]. AVP adjusts the amount of AQP2 in the plasma membrane by triggering the redistribution of AQP2 from intracellular storage vesicles into the plasma membrane (Fig. 1). This permits adaptation to the changing water demand of the organism. Defects of this mechanism, caused for instance by mutations of the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) or AQP2 genes, lead to nephrogenic diabetes insipidus (NDI), a disease characterised by a massive production of hypoosmotic urine [40].

The translocation of AQP2 is initiated by an increase of cAMP following V2R activation through AVP [13]. V2R activation presumably stimulates adenylyl cyclase VI as its expression has been detected in renal principal cells [41–43]. Adenylyl cyclases II, III, IV and IX are also expressed along the collecting duct, but it is not known whether any of these is expressed in principal cells. The AVP-induced raise in cAMP activates PKA, which in turn phosphorylates AQP2. This phosphorylation triggers the AQP2 translocation from the vesicles to the plasma membrane [44,45]. Cyclic AMP elicits the AQP2 redistribution in primary cultured rat inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells without an increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ ([46]; Fig. 1B). In other cellular models a stimulatory role of Ca²⁺ in the AQP2 translocation was suggested [38,47]. However, inhibition of PKA by H89 or disruption of its interaction with AKAPs abolishes the AVP-induced redistribution of AQP2 in cellular models such as IMCD or AQP2-expressing rabbit CD8 and porcine LLC-PK1 cortical collecting duct cells [48–50]. In addition, H89 inhibits an AVP-induced increase in water permeability in rabbit cortical collecting ducts by 90% suggesting that PKA is the principal cAMP effector in this system [51].

Several lines of evidence indicate that the cAMP signalling in renal principal cells is compartmentalized [3,52,53]. In IMCD cells, forskolin, a direct activator of adenylyl cyclase, increases cAMP levels and PKA activity twofold higher than AVP, while both agents induce the AQP2 translocation to a similar extent. AVP induces perinuclear PKA activation, while forskolin leads to PKA activation throughout the cell, indicating that activation of a pool of PKA in a defined region of the cells has a similar effect on the localization of AQP2 as activation of PKA throughout the cell [53]. Moreover, displacement of PKA from AKAPs with the PKA anchoring disruptor peptide Ht31

Fig. 1. The vasopressin (AVP)-triggered redistribution of AQP2 from intracellular vesicles into the plasma membrane depends on the anchoring of PKA by AKAPs. A. Model of the insertion of AQP2 into the plasma membrane. Activation of the vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) in the basolateral plasma membrane of renal principal cells by binding of AVP leads to increased intracellular cAMP levels activating perinuclear PKA. AKAP18δ tethers PKA to AQP2-containing vesicles and thereby presumably facilitates the phosphorylation of AQP2, which triggers the AQP2 translocation to the plasma membrane and thus water reabsorption from primary urine. At least three AQP2 molecules within a tetramer must be phosphorylated for the translocation to occur [147]. PDE4D3/9 located on the AQP2 containing vesicles decreases local concentrations of cAMP, thereby limiting local PKA activity. B. Detection of AQP2 in resting and AVP-treated primary cultured inner medullary collecting duct (IMCD) cells. AQP2 is located on intracellular vesicles in resting cells and at the plasma membrane of AVP-treated cells. The stearate-coupled and thus membrane-permeable PKA anchoring disruptor peptide S-AKAP18δ-L314E [54] prevents the AVP-induced redistribution of AQP2. The inactive control peptide S-AKAP18δ-PP does not interfere with the redistribution.

prevents the AVP-induced AQP2 redistribution, indicating that compartmentalization of PKA is achieved by AKAPs ([49]; Fig. 1B). AKAP18δ is likely to be involved in this process. Besides other AKAPs, it tethers PKA to AQP2-bearing vesicles, thereby presumably facilitating AQP2 phosphorylation [53–55].

Local degradation of cAMP by PDEs also participates in controlling the insertion of AQP2 into the plasma membrane [53]. There are 11 families of PDEs (PDE1–11) of which PDE1, 3, 4 and 5 are expressed in renal principal cells. Amongst these, the PDE4 family members are the most abundant ones [56]. All PDEs are sensitive to inhibition by 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), while only the PDE4 family is selectively inhibited by rolipram. In IMCD cells, neither IBMX nor rolipram affect basal cAMP levels but both enhance cAMP generation in response to AVP or forskolin. IBMX increases AVP- or forskolin-induced cAMP raises fivefold each, and rolipram two-threefold each. Together with rolipram, forskolin leads to a fivefold higher cAMP level than the combination of rolipram and AVP. Despite the different effects of IBMX and rolipram on the AVP-induced accumulation of cAMP, both PDE inhibitors enhance the AVP-induced AQP2 translocation by approximately 20%. The data indicate that PDE4 family members play a major role in the AQP2 redistribution [53].
The PDE4 family comprises PDE4A, B, C and D isoforms [5]. Renal principal cells express PDE4A, C and D. PDE4D is the only one located on AQP2-bearing vesicles, and in response to AVP accumulates together with AQP2 at the plasma membrane. Of the nine splice variants of PDE4D [57], PDE4D3 and/or PDE4D9 (PDE4D3/9) are located on AQP2-bearing vesicles. Vesicular PDE4D was suggested to prevent activation of vesicular PKA in resting principal cells and thus inappropriate translocation of AQP2, presumably by local hydrolysis of cAMP [53]. The activities of all long isoforms of PDE4A-D are increased by PKA phosphorylation. PDE4D3 is PKA phosphorylated at serine 54 [58,59]. AVP causes the accumulation of phosphorylated PDE4D3/9 at the plasma membrane of IMCD cells. The phosphorylation accelerates local hydrolysis of cAMP, thereby lowering PKA activity in close proximity to AQP2. This limits further AQP2 phosphorylation and integration into the plasma membrane [53].

PDE4D and AKAP18δ interact directly, and both proteins reside on the same intracellular vesicles as AQP2 and PKA, suggesting that a local signal transduction module comprising AKAP18δ-anchored PDE4D3/9 and PKA plays a crucial role in the regulation of the phosphorylation of AQP2, and thereby of its cellular localization [3,52,53] (Fig. 1A). Another signalling module located on AQP2-bearing vesicles is also likely to participate in the control of the AQP2 phosphorylation status. Jo et al. recovered a protein complex from rat inner medullary collecting duct endosomes consisting of a yet unidentified 90 kDa AKAP, RII subunits of PKA, and protein phosphatase 2B (PP2B), which dephosphorylates AQP2 [60].

### 2.2. Renin secretion from juxtaglomerular cells

Renin is synthesized in juxtaglomerular (JG) cells of the kidney. Its secretion into the blood increases arterial blood pressure through the renin–angiotensin system. Renin converts angiotensinogen into angiotensin I, which in turn is cleaved by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) into angiotensin II. Angiotensin II activates angiotensin AT₁ receptors on several cell types. For example, activation of the receptors on endothelial smooth muscle cells induces vasoconstriction. Renin secretion is elicited by cAMP-elevating agonists such as noradrenaline or prostaglandin E₂ through stimulation of Gₛ-coupled seven transmembrane receptors. The involvement of Gₛ is underlined by the finding that mouse JG cells deficient in the alpha subunit of Gₛ display a >90% decreased basal renin secretion, and do not respond to isoprotenerol or prostaglandin E₂ with increased renin secretion [61] (Fig. 2).

Renin release is inhibited by Ca²⁺-elevating hormones including angiotensin II and endothelin-1 [12]. JG cells express adenyl cyclases I, IV, V, VI and IX [12]. While adenyl cyclases I is stimulated by Ca²⁺, Ca²⁺ has no effect on IV and IX, and inhibits adenyl cyclases V and VI [62]. Expression of adenyl cyclases V and VI suggests that they play a key role in renin secretion because they are the potential targets for the inhibitory action of Ca²⁺. In primary JG cells, the selective adenyl cyclase V inhibitor, NKY80, blocks both the Ca²⁺ chelator BAPTA-AM-induced cAMP formation and renin release [63]. In addition, the Ca²⁺-elevating agonists endothelin-1 and thapsigargin abolish isoproterenol-stimulated renin release by preventing the elevation of intracellular cAMP levels [12,64]. Of note, this effect is attenuated if all adenyl cyclase isoforms are non-selectively activated with forskolin. In this case the Ca²⁺-elevating agents inhibit renin release and elevation of the intracellular cAMP level by only 40%. Similarly, the knock down of adenyl cyclase V or VI by RNAi in the renin-secreting As4.1 cells does not affect basal intracellular cAMP levels and renin secretion, but lowers the isoproterenol- or forskolin-stimulated increases in cAMP levels and renin exocytosis.

![Figure 2](attachment://image.png)

Fig. 2. Regulation of renin secretion. Ligands such as noradrenalin (NA) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂) bind to their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors activating the Gₛ/adenylate cyclase system and increasing intracellular cAMP levels. Cyclic AMP activates PKA, eventually leading to secretion of renin. Cyclic AMP is degraded mainly by phosphodiesterase PDE3 and 4 isoforms. Ligands including angiotensin II (AngII) and endothelins I and II (ET) increase cytosolic Ca²⁺ by binding to their cognate receptors coupled to the G-protein Gq. Ca²⁺ inhibits adenylate cyclases V and VI (ACV and VI), thereby decreasing cAMP production and preventing renin exocytosis.release to similar degrees as Ca²⁺-elevating agents [12]. Double knock down of adenylyl cyclase V and VI prevents β-adrenoceptor-mediated increases in cAMP levels and renin secretion [12]. Thus β-adrenoreceptors mainly mediate activation of the Ca²⁺-inhibited adenylyl cyclases V and VI. In cardiac myocytes, a Ca²⁺-sensitive adenylyl cyclase, presumably adenylyl cyclase VI, interacts with β₂-adrenoceptors and the complex is located in caveolin-rich membrane domains [65]. In JG cells adenylyl cyclases V and VI may also be compartmentalized together with β-adrenoceptors to facilitate their selective activation.

Intriguingly, adenylyl cyclases V and VI are not only found at the plasma membrane of JG cells but also colocalize with renin in cytoplasmic granules [64]. The role of intracellular adenylyl cyclases is not clear but it is conceivable that they elevate local cAMP, and thereby activate a cAMP-dependent signalling pathway on renin granules, which elicits secretion. However, the mode of activation of the intracellular adenylyl cyclases in JG cells is unknown.

As expected, PDEs are involved in controlling the cellular cAMP level in JG cells. Renin secreting As4.1 cells express PDE3A, 3B, 4B and 4D [66]. Their non-selective inhibition with IBMX increases cAMP levels tenfold and renin secretion twofold in the absence of other cAMP-elevating agents [12]. A central role of the cAMP-specific, cGMP-inhibited PDE3 has been revealed in studies using primary JG cells, perfused kidneys and whole animals, showing that cGMP is likely to increase renin secretion through inhibition of this PDE [67–71]. Further studies are required to elucidate the localization of PDE activity in JG cells in order to understand their contribution to compartmentalized cAMP signalling.

The major cAMP effector in JG cells is PKA since its inhibition by the cAMP analogue Rp-cAMPS prevents renin release [72]. However, where PKA activity is located and whether PKA–AKAP interactions are required for renin secretion is currently unknown.

Epac activation. PKA phosphorylates L-type Ca²⁺ channels, thereby increasing their open probability and facilitating enhanced Ca²⁺ influx. PKA modulates ATP-sensitive K⁺-channel and IP₃ receptor activities, and may thereby promote elevation of cytosolic Ca²⁺. Epac may participate by increasing Ca²⁺ entry into the cytosol from the ER through RyR receptors (see below) (Fig. 3). Ca²⁺ may then inhibit the Ca²⁺-sensitive adenylyl cyclases V and VI (see below). Thus a loop of cAMP synthesis, Ca²⁺ entry and Ca²⁺ inhibition of cAMP synthesis may account for the oscillations [74]. Both the amplitude and the frequency of the oscillations seem to transmit information determining cAMP effector activity. For example, low and high amplitudes may activate PKA and Epac, respectively. PKA is activated at nanomolar cAMP concentrations of (K_D < 1 μM) and Epac at micromolar concentrations (K_D = 4 μM). Oscillatory cAMP signalling does not induce the nuclear accumulation of catalytic PKA subunits. Sustained elevation of cAMP also leads to Ca²⁺ oscillations and increased insulin secretion, but does induce the translocation of catalytic PKA subunits into the nucleus [73], indicating that this mode of cAMP signalling influences PKA-dependent transcription.

The Ca²⁺-inhibited adenylyl cyclases V and VI are the major adenylyl cyclases in rat and human β-cells [75]. Rat β-cells also express Ca²⁺-stimulated adenylyl cyclases I and VIII at low level [76]. In addition, rat β-cells and various β-cell models express further adenylyl cyclases including II, III, IV, VII [75,77]. The Ca²⁺ sensitivity of the major β-cell adenylyl cyclases suggests that they synchronize cAMP and Ca²⁺ signalling.

β-cells express PDE1C, PDE3B, PDE4, and PDE10A [78–80]. The Ca²⁺-activated PDE1C may integrate cAMP and Ca²⁺ signals by shaping the cAMP and thus Ca²⁺ oscillations by degradation of cAMP [77]. The functionally most important isoform is PDE3B. It is located on insulin granules [81], its inhibition by milrinone augments insulin secretion *in vivo* [82], and transgenic mice overexpressing PDE3B in pancreatic β-cells display a decreased insulin secretion [83].

The GLP-1-induced potentiation of insulin secretion involves anchoring of PKA by AKAPs since disruption of AKAP–PKA interactions with the PKA anchoring disruptor peptide Ht31 inhibits the GLP-1-induced potentiation of insulin secretion in primary islets and RINm5F cells, cAMP-responsive insulin-secreting clonal β-cells [84]. Consistently, disrupting PKA anchoring inhibits GLP-1-mediated increases in cytosolic Ca²⁺ while it has no effect on cAMP-independent Ca²⁺ currents evoked by membrane depolarisation [84]. The L-type Ca²⁺ channel agonist BAYK8644 partially restores both the Ht31-inhibited GLP-1-mediated enhancement of insulin secretion, and the Ht31-inhibited cytosolic Ca²⁺ elevation underscoring L-type Ca²⁺ channels as sites for (anchored) PKA action [84]. AKAP18α, also termed AKAP15 or AKAP7α, tethers PKA to L-type Ca²⁺ channels. The AKAP18α–PKA interaction is direct and facilitates channel phosphorylation by PKA [85]. AKAP18α is expressed in the pancreas. Overexpressed AKAP18α localizes to the plasma membrane in RINm5F cells [86], recruits PKA, and increases the GLP-1-induced enhancement of L-type Ca²⁺ channel currents and insulin secretion [86]. Thus AKAP18α-dependent PKA phosphorylation of L-type Ca²⁺ channels is

### 2.3. Insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells

The primary stimulus for insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells is the elevation of the blood glucose level. Glucose is taken up by GLUT-2 glucose transporters and eventually increases ATP. ATP blocks ATP-sensitive K⁺-channels and causes depolarisation of the plasma membrane. This in turn opens voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels, allows Ca²⁺ entry and facilitates insulin exocytosis. A variety of stimuli including glucagon and incretins such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) potentiate the glucose-mediated Ca²⁺-dependent insulin secretion by stimulating the production of cAMP through activation of the Gₛ/adenylyl cyclase system. An increase of cAMP in the absence of Ca²⁺ elevation is not sufficient to trigger insulin exocytosis, suggesting a coordinated interplay between Ca²⁺ and cAMP signalling. Indeed, GLP-1 elicits an initial cAMP raise followed by elevation of cytosolic Ca²⁺. Subsequently, cAMP and Ca²⁺ oscillate synchronously [73]. How cAMP gives rise to Ca²⁺ oscillations in β-cells is unclear. Several pathways are conceivable: the mechanism is likely to involve PKA and

Fig. 3. Model of cAMP signalling compartments maintained by AKAPs and Epac in insulin-secreting pancreatic β-cells. Glucose is transported into the β-cells by the type 2 glucose transporter (GLUT2). The subsequent metabolism of glucose increases ATP. This induces closure of ATP-sensitive K⁺-channels, leading to plasma membrane depolarisation, which in turn opens voltage-gated L-type Ca²⁺ channels and facilitates Ca²⁺ influx. Ligands including GLP-1 increase intracellular cAMP levels through activation of the Gₛ/adenylyl cyclase system. Cyclic AMP activates PKA, which is tethered to cellular compartments by AKAPs. AKAP18α anchors PKA to L-type Ca²⁺ channel and facilitates channel phosphorylation by PKA. The phosphorylation increases the open probability of the channel. The consequent increased Ca²⁺ entry enhances insulin secretion. AKAP79 binds PKA and protein phosphatase PP2B and regulates the phosphorylation of synapsin-1, a key regulator of neuronal exocytosis. Cyclic AMP also activates Epac2, which directs cAMP signalling to different compartments. Epac2 associates with the SUR-1 subunit of the ATP-sensitive K⁺-channels at the plasma membrane (and also on intracellular vesicles) and with insulin-containing vesicles through the interaction with Rim2 and Piccolo. The latter two are associated with the vesicles through the small GTPase Rab3, a marker for exocytic vesicles. In addition, Epac participates in the control of ryanodine receptors (RyR) and thereby in the regulation of Ca²⁺ influx from the ER into the cytosol. Epac-dependent enhancement of Ca²⁺ entry into the cytosol is thought to increase insulin secretion. Cyclic AMP is degraded predominantly by PDE3 and 4 isoforms. PDE3B resides on insulin granules where it locally degrades cAMP.

Fig. 4. Model of cAMP- and Ca²⁺-mediated H⁺ secretion in gastric parietal cells. An increase of either intracellular cAMP (e.g. through stimulation of Gₛ-coupled H₂ receptors) or Ca²⁺ (e.g. through stimulation of Gq-coupled M3 receptors) triggers the fusion H⁺/K⁺-ATPase-containing tubulovesicular structures with the plasma membrane and thereby H⁺ secretion. Amongst other functions ezrin directs PKA to cellular compartments. Ezrin is phosphorylated by PKA at serin 66 in response to histamine challenge. The phosphorylation is necessary for the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase redistribution and H⁺ secretion. PDE4 is the functionally most relevant PDE in parietal cells. Ach, acetylcholine.
likely to play a role in the cAMP-dependent enhancement of insulin secretion. AKAP79 targets PKA to L-type Ca²⁺ channels in neurons [87] but is unlikely to participate in L-type Ca²⁺ channel regulation in β-cells because its overexpression in RINm5F decreases insulin secretion. However, AKAP79 forms complexes with other interacting partners in β-cells. A complex comprising AKAP79, PKA and protein phosphatase-2B (PP-2B) may coordinate the phosphorylation of PKA substrates that participate in regulating insulin exocytosis [88]. AKAP79 also interacts with IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1 (IQGAP1) in RINm5F cells and colocalizes with it in human β-cells. IQGAP1 interacts with G-actin and a variety of proteins regulating the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton. By recruiting PKA into the IQGAP1 complex AKAP79 may participate in cAMP-dependent regulation of cytoskeletal elements involved in the trafficking of insulin-bearing vesicles [89].

GLP-1- and also glucose-induced increases in cAMP levels activate not only PKA but also Epac2. Antisense oligonucleotides directed against Epac2 partially inhibit cAMP-induced Ca²⁺-dependent increases in insulin secretion from MIN-6 cells and pancreatic islets [90]. The Epac activator 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP enhances cytosolic Ca²⁺- and glucose-dependent insulin secretion [91]. It is unclear whether Epac exerts its stimulatory effect by activation of its well established effectors Rap1 and Rap2. Epac interacts with several β-cell proteins and thereby directs the action of cAMP to multiprotein complexes regulating different steps of insulin secretion. Epac2 interacts with the sulphonylurea receptor-1 (SUR1) subunit of the ATP-sensitive K⁺-channel and thereby inhibits the channel causing plasma membrane depolarisation [92,93]. Activation of Epac with 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP increases the influx of Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol through RyR receptors. This appears to involve indirect interaction of Epac with RyR receptors [91]. By its interaction with two other proteins, Rim2 and Piccolo, Epac2 participates in the regulation of docking and fusion of insulin-containing vesicles with the plasma membrane. Rim2 localizes both to the plasma membrane and to insulin granules and thus directs Epac2 to both compartments. Rim2 lacking its zinc-finger and C2 Ca²⁺-binding domains but not the Epac2 binding domain inhibits the 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP-induced enhancement of insulin secretion whereas Rim2 lacking the Epac2 binding site does not affect insulin secretion from MIN-6 cells [90]. Thus the stimulatory effect of Epac2 on insulin secretion is dependent on its interaction with Rim2. Picollo, a Rim2-interacting protein on insulin granules, also interacts with Epac2. Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides against Piccolo inhibit 8-pCPT-2′OMe-cAMP- and glucose-induced insulin secretion [94]. Taken together, by engaging in protein–protein interactions Epac2 targets cAMP signalling to specific sites in β-cells where insulin exocytosis is controlled.

### 2.4. Acid secretion from gastric parietal cells

Parietal cells are epithelial cells with distinct morphological characteristics. The apical plasma membrane forms invaginations (canaliculi) and the cytoplasm contains abundant tubulovesicular structures enriched in H⁺/K⁺-ATPase. An increase of either intracellular cAMP or Ca²⁺ triggers the fusion of the tubulovesicular structures with the plasma membrane and thereby H⁺ secretion into the stomach lumen [14]. The major physiological stimuli of the fusion and thus H⁺ secretion include histamine, acetylcholine, and gastrin. They activate their cognate G-protein-coupled receptors located in the basolateral plasma membrane. Histamine H₂ receptors trigger elevation of cAMP, and acetylcholine muscarinic M3 receptors signal through elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺. Gastrin acts predominantly indirectly by stimulating histamine release from enterochromaffin-like cells in the fundic mucosa. In addition, gastrin activates parietal cell CCK2 receptors and thereby increases intracellular Ca²⁺.

The principal effector of cAMP in parietal cells is PKA. Several substrates or potential substrates for PKA phosphorylation including the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase and ezrin were identified [95,96]. The functional consequence of H⁺/K⁺-ATPase phosphorylation is unclear (Fig. 4). Ezrin functions as an AKAP [97]. It binds RII subunits of PKA with low affinity (K_D for binding of RII ~ 50 μM) compared with other AKAPs (e.g. K_D for binding of RIIβ to AKAP18δ=20 nM) [55]. Ezrin belongs to the ezrin–radixin–moesin (ERM) protein family. The ERM proteins connect the cytoskeleton with plasma membrane proteins. Consistently, in parietal cells, ezrin colocalizes with F-actin [97,98]. In addition, it is found on apical membrane canaliculi and to a lesser extent at the basolateral plasma membrane [96]. PKA phosphorylates ezrin on serine 66 in response to histamine. The phosphorylation is necessary for the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase translocation and H⁺ secretion, since the substitution of serine 66 with alanine inhibits the redistribution of the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase [99]. The phosphorylation mimicking S66D mutant of ezrin is also located at the apical membrane and mimics the apical membrane remodelling induced by histamine [99]. It is not known whether phosphorylation of ezrin at serine 66 is mediated by the ezrin-anchored pool of PKA. The relevance of ezrin for H⁺ secretion is underlined by animal studies. Ezrin knock down mice suffer of severe achlorhydria and defects in the formation of canaliculi [100].

Another AKAP identified in parietal cells is AKAP350. In most cells, AKAP350 is located at centrosomes but in parietal cells it additionally localizes to intracellular foci presumably representing microtubules. AKAP350 is necessary for maintaining the Golgi integrity and remodelling of microtubules in HeLa cells [101]. As microtubules are involved in protein and vesicle transport, AKAP350 may link the cytoskeleton with the redistribution of the H⁺/K⁺-ATPase.

The few identified potential substrates of PKA in parietal cells include debrin E2 and LASP-1. Overexpression of debrin E2 leads to the formation of microspikes and cytosolic F-actin-rich ring-like structures in cultured parietal cells and suppresses cAMP-dependent H⁺ secretion by preventing cAMP-dependent F-actin rearrangements [102]. Cyclic AMP-dependent phosphorylation induces the partial translocation of LASP-1 to the apical F-actin-rich canalicular membrane, the site of active H⁺ secretion [103]. The influence of LASP-1 on H⁺ secretion is not known. Although further analyses of the role of debrin E2,
LASP-1 and AKAP350 in H⁺ secretion are lacking, the available studies indicate that PKA is tethered to specific compartments where it phosphorylates its substrates.

PDE3, 4, and 5 are expressed in parietal cells. Selective inhibition of the PDE4 family with rolipram does not affect basal H⁺ secretion but potentiates histamine-induced H⁺ secretion. Inhibition of PDE3 and PDE5 has no effect on histamine-mediated H⁺ secretion [104], indicating that PDE4 is the functionally most relevant PDE in parietal cells. Where PDE4 acts and which isoforms are involved remains to be determined.

### 3. Molecular tools to investigate compartmentalized cAMP signalling

Traditional biochemical approaches (e.g., radioimmunoassay) to measure cellular cAMP levels do not take local concentration changes into account. In order to study the dynamics of cAMP locally in living cells, several fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based probes utilizing PKA, PKA substrate peptides (e.g., AKAR1-3), Epac, and cAMP-gated ion channels have been generated, and in addition, caged cAMP, activated by localized photolysis, has become available [46, 105–111]. Cyclic AMP analogues for selective activation of either PKA or Epac have been synthesized, allowing to study the separate cAMP signalling pathways involving these two cAMP effectors [92, 112, 113]. PKA anchoring disruptor peptides have been developed to elucidate the role of AKAP-dependent compartmentalization of PKA signalling. Such peptides, mostly derived from the RII-binding domains of selected AKAPs (e.g., AKAP-Lbc or AKAP18δ), prevent the tethering but not the activation of PKA [54, 114–117].

### 4. Summary

Cyclic AMP is the principal trigger of regulated exocytic processes in various non-neuronal cells. They include: JG cells releasing renin, parietal cells secreting H⁺, and renal principal cells, responding to elevation of cAMP with the insertion of AQP2 into the plasma membrane. In addition, cAMP enhances Ca²⁺-triggered exocytic events such as insulin release.

It is emerging that the Ca²⁺-inhibited adenylyl cyclase V and VI are the predominant adenylyl cyclases isoforms expressed in cells undergoing regulated exocytic processes. They are the major isoforms in JG and renal principal cells. Expression of these isoforms allows for synchronizing cAMP and Ca²⁺ signalling. It is likely that they play a major role in establishing the cAMP oscillations in pancreatic β-cells, which regulate insulin secretion. However, β-cells also express the Ca²⁺-stimulated adenylyl cyclases I and VIII. Their role in insulin secretion is unclear. PDEs are the sole means of degrading cAMP and are involved in locally terminating cAMP signalling. Mostly PDE3 and PDE4 isoforms are involved in cAMP-dependent control of exocytic events. They are located at specific cellular compartments such as exocytic vesicles (e.g., PDE4D on AQP2-bearing vesicles and PDE3B on insulin granules) and the plasma membrane, where they establish microenvironments with differing local concentrations of cAMP. The compartmentalized cAMP synthesis and degradation is accompanied by compartmentalization of cAMP effectors. PKA is tethered to defined cellular sites by AKAPs and thereby directed to its substrates. So far only a few AKAPs have been detected in exocytic cells and none has been unequivocally defined to be functionally involved in a particular process. Likewise, only a few PKA substrates have been identified, and their functional role remains to be elucidated. However, it is emerging that the compartmentalization of PKA by AKAPs is a major requirement for cAMP-dependent control of exocytic processes (e.g., GLP-1-enhanced insulin secretion). The PKA substrates and AKAPs identified so far differ between the different exocytic cell types. Thus it appears that cAMP synthesis and degradation is controlled by a limited set of adenylyl cyclase and PDE isoforms in all exocytic cell types, and that cell-type-specific differences are due to different sets of PKA substrates and AKAPs. The molecular mechanisms underlying the involvement of Epac in compartmentalized cAMP signalling in regulated exocytosis are only beginning to emerge. Mainly studies of insulin secretion indicate that Epac is tethered to different compartments where it regulates various steps of insulin exocytosis.

Proteins regulating a particular exocytic event are part of signal transduction complexes formed on the basis of direct protein-protein interactions. For example, complexes consisting of AKAP18δ-PKA-PDE4D and of a 90 kDa AKAP, PKA and PP2B on AQP2-bearing vesicles in principal cells control the phosphorylation status of AQP2, which in turn defines its cellular location [53, 60].

### 5. Conclusions and perspectives

The currently available data suggest that cAMP signalling that regulates exocytic events occurs in defined compartments. Nevertheless, the current dearth of information on the players of compartmentalized cAMP signalling in exocytic cells demand their identification in order to comprehensively understand the role of compartmentalization of cAMP signalling in exocytic processes on the molecular level. In particular, the identification of PKA substrates, AKAPs and Epac interaction partners and substrates is necessary as they provide a basis of cell-type specificity of each process. In addition, the functional consequences of the phosphorylations of the few identified substrates must be elucidated. For example, PKA apparently phosphorylates LASP-1 in gastric parietal cell [103], but the consequence of the phosphorylation is not known. LASP-1 may participate in cAMP-induced rearrangements of F-actin. The picture on the involvement of adenylyl cyclases and PDEs is incomplete. It is likely that cAMP synthesis in exocytic cells is intricately regulated by a negative feedback loop similar to the one regulating cAMP synthesis in rat brain. Here AKAP79 tethers PKA to adenylyl cyclases V and VI and facilitates their PKA phosphorylation, which down-regulates their activities [31]. In most exocytic cells the cellular locations at which PDE3 and PDE4 isoforms act are not known, and the expression patterns of other cAMP hydrolysing PDEs (PDE1, 2, 7, 8, 10 and 11) have not been systematically examined.
The use of fluorescent cAMP-, PKA- and Epac activity reporters will allow to trace signalling events from the site of signal generation to the site where it elicits a particular reaction. This is of interest in all exocytic cells but particularly relevant in renal principal cells. In these cells it is unclear how the AVP-induced activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent raise of cAMP at the plasma membrane translates into the predominant activation of perinuclear PKA and subsequent redistribution of AQP2-bearing vesicles to the plasma membrane [53]. Consistent with the long distance the cAMP signal travels to the vesicles and the long distance the vesicles travel from their main storage site around the nucleus to the plasma membrane, the fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane upon AVP challenge occurs after a lag phase (~20 s), indicating that a pool of readily releasable vesicles is missing [46]. In other exocytic cells a readily releasable pool of vesicles is docked to the plasma membrane and fuses with it in response to an appropriate stimulus, accounting for the fast response that occurs within milliseconds. Tracing the signalling events and identifying the key players regulating the redistribution of AQP2 into the plasma membrane will help to explain this fundamental difference between slow and fast exocytic events, triggered by cAMP and Ca²⁺, respectively.

Understanding the compartmentalized cAMP signalling processes governing exocytic processes on the molecular level requires dissection of protein–protein interactions within identified signalling complexes. Roles of selected protein–protein interactions in cellular processes may be for example studied by disruption of the interactions with membrane-permeable peptides derived from the binding sites [148]. However, studies of protein function within a signal transduction complex by this approach is not appropriate in all cases because different signalling proteins may bind to overlapping sites on scaffolding proteins. For example, PKA and PDE4D3 bind to overlapping sites in the C terminus of AKAP18δ, and the scaffolding proteins RACK1 and β-arrestin bind to overlapping regions of PDE4D5 [53,118]. Recently, small molecules for the disruption of selected protein–protein interactions have been identified [119,120]. For example, G-protein βγ subunits interact through the same surface with G-protein α subunits, as PLCβ2, PLCβ3 and PI3Kγ. One small molecule binds G-protein βγ subunits and attenuates Gβ₁γ₂-dependent activation of PLCβ2, PLCβ3 and PI3Kγ. Another small molecule also binds G-protein βγ subunits but does not affect Gβ₁γ₂-dependent activation of PLCβ2 but potentiates Gβ₁γ₂-dependent PLCβ3 and PI3Kγ activation [121]. Such inhibitors of protein–protein interactions will in the future contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the cAMP control of exocytic processes.
