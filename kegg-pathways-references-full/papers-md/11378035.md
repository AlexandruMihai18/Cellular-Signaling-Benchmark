# Pathophysiology of amoebiasis

## Samuel L. Stanley, Jr


Few organisms are more aptly named than *Entamoeba histolytica*, an intestinal protozoan parasite that can lyse and destroy human tissue. Within the past four years, new models of *E. histolytica* infection have begun to illuminate how amoebic trophozoites cause intestinal disease and liver abscess, and have expanded our understanding of the remarkable killing ability of this parasite. Here, I summarize recent work on the interactions between *E. histolytica* and human intestine, and between *E. histolytica* and hepatocytes, and discuss what these studies tell us about the role of inflammation and programmed cell death in the pathogenesis of amoebiasis.

The major clinical manifestations of *Entamoeba histolytica* infection are amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscesses. Amoebic colitis is characterized by ulceration and inflammation of the colon. The gut inflammation can be so severe that amoebic colitis can be confused with inflammatory bowel disease¹,². Neutrophils are the prominent host inflammatory cell early in infection. As disease progresses, with *E. histolytica* trophozoites spreading through the submucosal layers to form the classic ‘flask’-shaped ulcers, neutrophils and other inflammatory cells can be seen in the lamina propria and submucosal layers, but are seen infrequently with amoebic trophozoites in the exudate overlying the ulcer³.

The prominent inflammatory component of amoebic colitis contrasts with the pathology of amoebic infection of the liver. Amoeba do not cause hepatitis but instead create amoebic liver abscesses, which are circumscribed regions of dead hepatocytes, liquefied cells and cellular debris surrounded by a rim of connective tissue, some inflammatory cells and few amoebic trophozoites⁴. The adjacent liver parenchyma is usually completely normal. The differences in pathology between amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscess indicate that either *E. histolytica* varies its virulence repertoire in the two organs or the responses of human intestine and human liver to amoebic infection are fundamentally different. Any viable model of amoebic pathogenesis must address these issues.

### Bind, lyse and eat

We know from *in vitro* studies that amoebae bind host cells via a galactose-binding lectin on the surface of *E. histolytica*⁵,⁶. Once contact is made, amoebae can lyse the target cell, using pore-forming molecules called amoebapores, and possibly phospholipases⁷,⁸. Cell lysis might be followed by amoebic phagocytosis of the dead cell⁹. The molecular basis for these events remains a vital area of research in amoebiasis. However, the model arising from these studies – *E. histolytica* causing tissue damage by simply lysing those cells that they contact, with host cells portrayed as passive victims of the parasite – is incomplete. The prominence of inflammation in amoebic colitis raises questions about the role of the host inflammatory response in the tissue damage seen in intestinal amoebiasis. The extensive hepatocyte death and apparent paucity of *E. histolytica* trophozoites in amoebic liver abscess is also difficult to reconcile with the bind-lyse-eat formulation.

TRENDS in Parasitology Vol.17 No.6 June 2001

Models of amoeba infection

To approach these questions, models are needed that allow us to study the cellular, immunological and molecular processes that occur at the organ level when *E. histolytica* contact intestine or liver. A first step was the development of a murine model of amoebic liver abscess<sup>10</sup>. Direct hepatic inoculation of amoeba into the livers of mice causes lesions that share some features with amoebic liver abscesses in humans. As in human abscesses, a thin ring of fibroblasts and connective tissue, few inflammatory cells, and few amoebic trophozoites surround a central area of dead hepatocytes and, in some cases, cellular debris and liquefied cells. Neutrophils are present early in infection and appear to play a role in controlling abscess spread, but prominent neutrophil influx and marked hepatitis are not usual components of amoebic liver abscess in the mouse model<sup>11,12</sup>.

*Entamoeba histolytica* is a human-specific pathogen and reproducible animal models of intestinal amoebiasis have proved elusive. To surmount this problem, a model of amoebic colitis was developed using severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice and human intestinal xenografts (SCID-HU-INT)<sup>13</sup>. Human intestinal xenografts are implanted into the subscapular region of SCID mice, allowed to mature into morphologically normal, mucin-secreting segments of human intestine and then infected with *E. histolytica*. Within 12 h of amoebic inoculation into the lumen of the intestinal xenograft, human intestines infected with *E. histolytica* develop focal ulcerations, with invasion into submucosal tissues that is indistinguishable from that seen in humans with amoebic colitis. In addition, by 24 h after infection, there can be a pronounced inflammatory response within the intestinal xenograft, with neutrophils influxing into the lamina propria and submucosal regions<sup>13</sup>. Although there are differences between the human intestinal xenografts and human intestine (e.g. a lack of normal flora, the absence of peristalsis and a closed loop), amoebic infection in the SCID-HU-INT model mimics a number of aspects of human amoebic colitis and provides a system that allows us to model the interactions between *E. histolytica* and human intestine *in vivo*.

Inflammatory response to amoebic infection

Gut inflammation is seen in individuals with amoebic colitis and is reproduced in the SCID-HU-INT model of disease, but how do amoebae induce gut inflammation? The first cell–cell contact takes place between *E. histolytica* trophozoites and human intestinal epithelial cells. Intestinal epithelial cells are important sensors of microbial infection<sup>14</sup>. Intestinally derived transformed cell lines produce a variety of pro-inflammatory mediators in response to intracellular infection with bacteria<sup>14</sup>, including interleukins 1 and 8 (IL-1 and IL-8), cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase. Several of these mediators can attract and activate neutrophils and macrophages, providing a mechanism by which intestinal epithelial cells could bring these cells to the site of pathogen invasion.

*Entamoeba histolytica*, an extracellular pathogen, can also induce the production of cytokines and chemokines from intestinally derived cell lines<sup>15-17</sup>. Incubation of amoebic trophozoites with cultured human cell lines caused secretion of IL-8, growth-related antigen α (GROα), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, IL-1α and IL-6 (Ref. 15). The induction of IL-8 production in HeLa cells by *E. histolytica* was mediated primarily through the effects of IL-1α, released from epithelial cells that were lysed by *E. histolytica* trophozoites<sup>15</sup>. These studies<sup>15-17</sup> definitively established the ability of amoebae to induce inflammatory cytokine production from epithelial cell lines. However, two critical questions remained. Did human intestinal epithelial cells produce cytokines in response to infection *in vivo*? And, if so, was *E. histolytica*-induced cytokine production from intestinal epithelial cells physiologically important in the pathogenesis of amoebic colitis?

One of the problems in approaching both these questions is the fact that intestinal epithelial cells are not the only cells capable of producing inflammatory mediators in infected gut. Within the intestine, influxing macrophages, monocytes and neutrophils, as well as resident intraepithelial lymphocytes, are all potential sources of cytokines and chemokines. It is here that an important advantage of the SCID-HU-INT mouse came to the fore: the SCID-HU-INT mouse is a chimera. Within the human intestinal xenograft, the intestinally derived cells are of human origin but the inflammatory cells, such as macrophages and neutrophils, are of murine origin<sup>18</sup>. Thus, by using assays specific for human cytokines and chemokines that do not detect their murine counterparts, one can dissect out the contribution of intestinal epithelial cells to the production of inflammatory mediators.

In amoebic colitis in SCID-HU-INT mice, specific assays for human cytokines demonstrated that human intestinal xenografts infected with *E. histolytica* produced 50-fold more human IL-1β and sixfold more IL-8 than uninfected human intestinal xenografts<sup>13</sup>. Immunofluorescence studies confirmed that intestinal epithelial cells in villi and crypts were the major source of IL-8 in *E. histolytica*-infected human intestine. Strikingly, IL-8 is produced not only in areas where amoebae are in direct contact with intestinal epithelial cells but also in intestinal epithelial cells far from the site of trophozoite contact and invasion<sup>13</sup> (Fig. 1). Thus, one mechanism by which amoebic trophozoites can cause human gut inflammation is by stimulating intestinal epithelial cells to produce inflammatory mediators.

Role of NF-κB in gut inflammation and tissue damage

Finding that *E. histolytica* can induce human intestine to produce inflammatory mediators *in vivo* brings us back to two important questions. Is the production of inflammatory mediators by human intestine

Fig. 1. Human intestinal epithelial cells in both crypts and villi produce interleukin 8 (IL-8) after xenograft infection with *Entamoeba histolytica*. Sections of an intestinal xenograft were obtained 24 h after infection with *E. histolytica* trophozoites and stained for IL-8 with the anti-human-IL-8 monoclonal antibody DM/C7 and donkey anti-mouse IgG conjugated to Cy3 as the secondary antibody. Immunofluorescent staining is found only in the *E. histolytica*-infected graft and is limited to epithelial cells in villi and crypts. No amoebae were visible in this section, indicating that staining occurs in regions far from amoebic contact. No IL-8 staining was detectable in an uninfected graft. Scale bar = 80 μm.

*E. histolytica*, this permeability barrier is lost<sup>21</sup>. However, grafts pretreated with the antisense oligonucleotide to inhibit NF-κB p65 subunit synthesis and then infected with *E. histolytica* maintained their permeability barrier<sup>21</sup>. Thus, blocking the inflammatory response to *E. histolytica* infection decreases the tissue damage seen in amoebic colitis in the SCID-HU-INT model of disease.

Which components of the inflammatory response are important in the tissue damage seen in amoebiasis? The most prominent inflammatory cell type seen early in amoebic infection is the neutrophil<sup>3</sup>. *E. histolytica* trophozoites can lyse neutrophils *in vitro*, causing them to release toxic substances such as superoxides, collagenases, elastases and cathepsins<sup>22,23</sup>. In a study of the interaction between amoebic trophozoites and an epithelial cell monolayer, the addition of neutrophils to amoebic trophozoites significantly increased damage to the monolayer<sup>24</sup>. This is consistent with an 'innocent bystander' effect in which the products of neutrophils lysed by *E. histolytica* trophozoites contribute to epithelial cell damage. To determine whether neutrophils are important effector cells in the intestinal damage caused by *E. histolytica in vivo*, neutrophils were depleted from SCID-HU-INT mice before infection of human intestinal xenografts with *E. histolytica*<sup>21</sup>. As would be expected, inflammation (as measured by tissue myeloperoxidase levels) was markedly reduced in amoeba-infected human intestines in neutrophil-depleted mice. However, there was also a significant reduction in damage to the intestinal permeability barrier in amoeba-infected neutrophil-depleted SCID-HU-INT mice, which is consistent with a role for neutrophils in the tissue damage seen in amoebic colitis.

Cysteine proteinases and amoebic colitis Which *E. histolytica* virulence factors are required to activate the inflammatory response in human intestine? There are several molecular families that have been implicated in amoebic pathogenesis but among the most prominent have been *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases<sup>25,26</sup>. The cysteine proteinases are secreted in large quantities by the parasite and can cleave extracellular matrix proteins, which might facilitate amoebic invasion<sup>27,28</sup>. They are established virulence factors in animal models of amoebic liver abscess<sup>29,30</sup>. A family of six genes encodes *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases (*ehcp1–6*) but ~90% of the proteinase activity is due to three of the enzymes, EhCP1, EhCP2 and EhCP5 (Ref. 25). Although targeted disruption of selected *E. histolytica* genes has not yet been achieved, stable episomal expression of foreign DNA is possible in amoebae by maintaining continuous selective pressure<sup>31,32</sup>. This has enabled investigators to target specific molecules in *E. histolytica* by the episomal expression of antisense mRNA or of genes encoding dominant negative mutants<sup>6,33</sup>. The antisense approach has been applied to *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases and episomal

An approach came from studies of the transcription factor NF-κB in gut inflammation. Mice treated with 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) develop a transmural colitis that mimics some characteristics of Crohn's disease and is associated with a marked activation of NF-κB (Ref. 19). NF-κB controls the expression of a number of genes involved in inflammation, including IL-1, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)<sup>20</sup>. It was found that direct intraluminal administration of an antisense oligonucleotide to the p65 subunit of NF-κB blocked p65 synthesis and thus NF-κB activation, and was highly effective in treating TNBS-induced colitis in mice<sup>19</sup>. These data suggest an approach to inhibiting intestinal epithelial cell cytokine production by treating human intestinal xenografts with antisense oligonucleotides that would inhibit the synthesis of the human, but not the murine, p65 subunit of NF-κB.

Human intestinal xenografts treated with intraluminal inoculation of an antisense oligonucleotide to the p65 subunit of human NF-κB and then infected with *E. histolytica* showed significantly lower levels of human IL-1β and IL-8 than *E. histolytica*-infected human intestinal xenografts that had been treated with a nonsense oligonucleotide<sup>21</sup>. Gut inflammation, as measured by the intestinal tissue levels of myeloperoxidase (a neutrophil and early-monocyte-specific enzyme), was also significantly lower in *E. histolytica*-infected human intestinal xenografts pretreated with the antisense oligonucleotide to the p65 subunit of NF-κB. These findings established that activation of NF-κB in human intestinal cells is required for initiating the inflammatory response to amoebic infection, but is this inflammatory response responsible for some of the tissue damage seen in amoebiasis?

To quantify intestinal damage, the permeability of the human intestinal xenograft to macromolecules was measured. Human intestinal xenografts normally maintain a permeability barrier to macromolecules but, 24 h after infection with

Fig. 2. Model for amoebic colitis. In this model amoebic trophozoites attach to intestinal epithelial cells via the galactose-binding lectin⁵. Binding might signal cellular changes in *Entamoeba histolytica* -a 'pathogenesis program', which might include secretion of amoebic cysteine proteinases and release of amoebapore at the site of epithelial cell contact⁶,⁴². This results in epithelial cell damage or death, with release of mediators including precursors of interleukin 1β (IL-1β), which might be cleaved by extracellular *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases to form the active cytokine¹³,³⁴. IL-1β, along with IL-1α released from cells, binds to adjacent intestinal epithelial cells and activates NF-κB (Ref. 21). Activation of NF-κB in intestinal epithelial cells results in synthesis of IL-1β, IL-8 and other mediators including cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (Ref. 13; W. Stenson *et al.*, unpublished). These mediators are released by the cells and attract host inflammatory cells, especially neutrophils, to the mucosal and submucosal regions. Neutrophils that contact amoebae are lysed and release mediators that can damage or kill intestinal epithelial cells. The migration of neutrophils between intestinal epithelial cells to the mucosal surface might further damage the intestinal permeability barrier. *E. histolytica* trophozoites then invade into the submucosal layers, using cysteine proteinases to cleave extracellular matrix proteins, and migrating between damaged cells.

expression of an antisense RNA to *ehcp5* could reduce total amoebic proteinase activity by 80–90% (Ref. 33).

To assess the role of *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases in amoebic colitis, the human intestinal xenografts in SCID-HU-INT mice were infected with amoebic trophozoites expressing the *ehcp5* antisense RNA (proteinase-deficient amoebae) or amoebic trophozoites containing the same plasmid without the antisense insert (the control group)³⁴. No obvious defect was apparent in the ability of cysteine-proteinase-deficient amoebae to attach to and survive within the colonic lumen. However, 24 h after infection, cysteine-proteinase-deficient amoeba had, in contrast to the control group, failed to induce significant amounts of human IL-1β or IL-8 from infected intestine. Gut inflammation was also reduced in human intestine infected with cysteine-proteinase-deficient

A cleavage site between Ser121 and Leu122 was found, five amino acids downstream of the caspase-1 site and consistent with the specificity of *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinase for an arginine in the P₂ position. More importantly, the product of the incubation of *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinase and pIL-1β displayed IL-1 activity in a specific bioassay³⁴. These findings provide another potential role for amoebic cysteine proteinases in the pathogenesis of amoebic colitis: activating pIL-1β. A model of amoebic colitis that incorporates a number of these findings is outlined in Fig. 2.

A number of points remain to be tested. A direct role of IL-1 in amoebic colitis in this model, and in humans with amoebiasis, has yet to be established. In addition, it has not been shown that conversion of pIL-1β to mature IL-1β by *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases occurs in vivo. Other inflammatory mediators, including TNFα, cyclooxygenase-2 and inducible nitric oxide synthase, might play significant roles in *E. histolytica*-induced gut inflammation and merit study. Finally, it needs to be emphasized that the inflammatory response to *E. histolytica*, although it contributes to tissue damage early in disease, might be crucial for controlling and limiting infection. There is ample clinical evidence that reducing inflammation in amoebic colitis without specific antiamoebic therapy can lead to progressive, persistent disease¹ (from patients with amoebic colitis who were given an erroneous diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease and treated with corticosteroids).

### Entamoeba histolytica and programmed cell death

When *E. histolytica* trophozoites are incubated with most types of mammalian cells, they will kill those cells in a contact-dependent manner²²,²³,³⁷. Some clearly die by lytic necrosis³⁸ but others might undergo apoptosis³⁹. Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an ordered system of cell death with an initiator or signaling phase followed by an effector stage that causes cell

Section of liver stained for apoptotic cells with the TUNEL method from an amoebic liver abscess in a C57Bl/6 MRL-lpr/lpr mouse. Amoebic trophozoites (long arrow) are adjacent to a cluster of inflammatory cells (short arrow), which show marked TUNEL staining. TUNEL staining in nuclei and cytoplasm is also evident in a band of dead hepatocytes and inflammatory cells (D). TUNEL-positive nuclei (brown staining) are also visible in hepatocytes in regions (H) flanking the dead cells. Scale bar = 60 μm. Reproduced, with permission, from Ref. 31.

death by degrading various cellular components. The effector stage involves the activation of caspases, cysteine proteinases with specificity for aspartate residues that form a cascade, converging on caspase 3. A key biochemical marker of apoptosis is endonuclease cleavage of chromatin between histone bodies, which can be seen as a DNA ladder on separating gels. Detection of DNA fragmentation *in situ* by the end-labeling of single- or double-stranded DNA breaks with terminal deoxyribonucleotidyl transferase (TUNEL assay) has also been used as a marker for apoptosis, although caution must be used in interpreting results from these assays⁴⁰.

The finding that *E. histolytica* could induce apoptosis *in vitro* raised the question of whether apoptosis is a component of the cell death seen in amoebic liver abscess. To test this, amoebae were inoculated into the livers of SCID mice and evidence for apoptosis was sought by gel separation of DNA from infected livers and TUNEL staining of amoebic liver abscesses⁴¹. DNA ladder formation could be detected in samples obtained from SCID mice by 1 h after amoebic inoculation. TUNEL staining revealed significant areas of apoptosis within amoebic liver abscesses, which were most pronounced in inflammatory cells and hepatocytes close to amoebic trophozoites⁴¹. However, some distant cells also were TUNEL positive. Thus, in the murine model of amoebic liver abscess, *E. histolytica*-induced cellular apoptosis appears to be a significant component of cell death (Fig. 3).

Interestingly, *E. histolytica*-induced apoptosis cannot be blocked by Bcl-2 (Ref. 39) and does not appear to involve either of the two of the major pathways for the induction of apoptosis: ligation of the Fas receptor and ligation of TNFα receptor 1 (TNFR1). In both C57Bl/6 MRL-lpr/lpr mice, which lack Fas receptor, and C57Bl/6.C3H-gld/gld mice, which lack Fas ligand, apoptosis was detected in amoebic liver abscesses by DNA ladder formation and TUNEL staining⁴¹. Apoptosis was also present in hepatocytes in amoebic liver abscesses from both TNFR1 knockout mice and the heterozygote controls⁴¹. These data indicate that *E. histolytica* causes apoptosis in mouse liver by a mechanism that is independent of Fas–Fas-ligand interactions and TNFR1.

#### Outlook

Nascent genetic approaches and new models of amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscesses have provided some fresh perspectives on the complex interactions between *E. histolytica* and the host. To the well-known abilities of *E. histolytica* to lyse cells and to digest extracellular matrix proteins, we can now add the capability to induce apoptosis in hepatocytes and inflammatory cells, and to stimulate, and perhaps enhance, an NF-κB-mediated human intestinal inflammatory response that contributes to tissue damage. These new pathways might offer an explanation for some of the clinical and pathological differences between amoebic colitis and amoebic liver

abscess, with colitis featuring an intestinal epithelial cell initiated inflammatory response, whereas hepatocyte apoptosis would predominate in amoebic liver abscesses. If these mechanisms prove to be important in human disease, they will provide new targets in both the host and the parasite for interventions designed to ameliorate or inhibit amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscesses.

### Corrigendum

In the Review article by A. Schwartz and J.C. Koella entitled 'Trade-offs, conflicts of interest and manipulation in *Plasmodium*-mosquito interactions' (*Trends Parasitol.* 17, 189–194, 2001), on p 192, 2nd column, 14 lines down, the sentence ending ‘… and *An. Stephensi* might deactivate sporozoites by synthesizing nitric acid³⁸.’ This should have read ‘… nitric oxide³⁸.’

We apologise to readers for any confusion caused by this error.
