Testicular cancer is the most frequent solid malignant tumour type in men 20–40 years of age. At the time of diagnosis up to 50% of the patients suffer from metastatic disease. In contrast to most other metastatic solid tumours, the majority of metastatic testicular cancer patients can be cured with highly effective cisplatin-based chemotherapy. This review aims to summarise the current knowledge on response to chemotherapy and the biological basis of cisplatin-induced apoptosis in testicular cancer. The frequent presence of wild-type TP53 and the low levels of p53 in complex with the p53 negative feed-back regulator MDM2 contribute to cisplatin sensitivity. Moreover, the high levels of the pluripotency regulator Oct4 and as a consequence of Oct4 expression high levels of miR-17/106b seed family and pro-apoptotic Noxa and the low levels of cytoplasmic p21 (WAF1/Cip1) appear to be causative for the exquisite sensitivity to cisplatin-based therapy of testicular cancer. However, resistance of testicular cancer to cisplatin-based therapy does occur and can be mediated through aberrant levels of the above mentioned key players. Drugs targeting these key players showed, at least pre-clinically, a sensitising effect to cisplatin treatment. Further clinical development of such treatment strategies will lead to new treatment options for platinum-resistant testicular cancers.

Testicular cancers represent the most frequent solid malignant tumours in men 20–40 years of age and the most frequent cause of death from tumours in this age group. In addition, the incidence of testicular cancer is still rising world-wide (Ref. 1). Based on histological, biochemical and clinical features, these tumours can be divided into seminomatous and non-seminomatous testicular cancer. Non-seminomas metastasise more widely and are less sensitive to radiotherapy than seminomatous testicular cancer, which has consequences for prognosis and treatment strategies. Non-seminomas display various stages of differentiation, ranging from the undifferentiated embryonal carcinoma (EC), the more differentiated extra-embryonic components such as yolk sac carcinomas (YS) and choriocarcinomas (ChC), to the highly differentiated teratoma (T) component (Refs 2, 3). It is noteworthy that most human cancer cell lines used as models for testicular cancer are of EC origin.

Platinum-based chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment of many cancers and is used as first-line therapy for testicular, bladder, lung and ovarian cancers. In case of bladder, lung and ovarian cancer there is often initial responsiveness to platinum-based chemotherapy. Nonetheless, the majority of these cancer patients will eventually relapse with platinum-resistant disease. In contrast, introduction of cisplatin-based therapy for testicular cancer patients in the mid-1970s has resulted in an enormous survival improvement, also in cases with extensive metastatic disease (Refs 4, 5).

Unfortunately, not all patients diagnosed with testicular cancer have a favourable outcome; a subset of patients with extensive metastatic spread belonging to the intermediate or poor risk group will not achieve a durable complete remission after initial treatment and will eventually die from their disease (Ref. 6). In depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms explaining why most but not all testicular cancer patients are curable with chemotherapy could lead to the development of more effective treatment of refractory testicular cancers and potentially other solid tumour types resistant to platinum-based chemotherapy.

Presence of wild-type TP53 in testicular cancer

TP53 is a tumour suppressor gene, which encodes a transcription factor with a dual role in the cellular stress response. Besides regulating its own negative feed-back regulators, MDM2 and MDM4, p53 transactivates a number of other genes that can either promote cell cycle arrest and DNA-repair, such as CDKN1A (encoding p21cip1/waf1 [p21]) and GADD45, or apoptosis via genes belonging to the extrinsic (or death receptor) apoptosis pathway, such as TNFRSF10B (KILLER/DR5), TNFRSF6 (FAS) or the intrinsic (or mitochondrial) apoptosis pathway, via genes such as BBC3 (Puma) and PMAIP1 (Noxa) (Refs 7, 8, 9). Activation of these p53-dependent pathways is crucial in the response to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin and a major role for p53 in determining treatment response has been described for several tumour types including testicular cancer (Refs 10, 11, 12, 13, 14).

A relatively unique feature of testicular cancers is the high percentage of tumours that retain wild-type TP53 (Refs 15, 16, 17). Although many other tumour types (ranging from 10 to 70% of the tumours) harbour mutations in TP53 that compromise p53 function, less than 1% of human testicular cancers show TP53 mutations (Refs 9, 18, 19, 20, 21). Lack of TP53 mutations in TCs has been explained by latent transcriptional activity of p53 at basal levels, which is reversed in response to DNA damage signals (Refs 22, 23). Other studies, however, suggested that p53 is functional in TC, since wild-type p53 levels correlate with expression levels of MDM2 in vitro and in vivo (Refs 24, 25, 26, 27). The p53 pathway is crucial for effective tumour suppression (Refs 10, 11, 28), and it was therefore argued that TCs have defects in the p53 pathway, outside a direct TP53 mutation (Fig. 1).

One typical downstream effect of p53 signalling is the activation of a cell cycle arrest at the G1/S transition. TCs are reported to have a deregulated G1/S checkpoint (Refs 29, 30, 31, 32), in line with almost undetectable p21 and pRb levels in seminomas and embryonal carcinomas, whereas p27, cyclin D2 and cyclin E are overexpressed due to gene amplification (Refs 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34). The presence of isochromosome 12 (i12p) in the majority of TC can explain the amplification of the p27 and cyclin D2 encoding genes CDKN1B and CNND2 (for further review on deregulated G1/S checkpoint in TC see (Refs 35, 36)). P27 is mainly cytoplasmically localised in TC cell lines

Figure 1. Presence of wild-type p53 in testicular cancer. The p53 pathway is crucial for effective tumour suppression, mainly by activation of a cell cycle arrest at the G₁/S transition. TCs are reported to have a deregulated G₁/S checkpoint, here we show a schematic overview of connected pathways, which are causative for the presence of wild-type p53 in testicular cancer. Solid black lines represent active, whereas solid grey lines represent in-active signalling. Note that if TC cells express high levels of p21 growth arrest will not occur, since p21 will be phosphorylated and therefore cytoplasmically localised.

due to PI3K/Akt-dependent phosphorylation of the nuclear localisation signal (NLS) domain of p27 (Ref. 37). Cytoplasmically localised p27 has lost the ability to inhibit cell cycle progression, but has gained altered tumour progression functions. In addition, p27 is associated with inhibition of apoptosis and interestingly, might actually promote G₁/S cell cycle progression in that case (Refs 38, 39). A reason for the high PI3K/Akt activity in TC might be the lack of PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue), a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Ref. 37).

In a recent study, a possible mechanism in TCs explaining the low p21 expression despite the presence of wild-type TP53 in these tumours was identified (Ref. 40). ECs share many similarities with embryonic stem cells (ES) (Refs 3, 41), including their miRNA expression profile (Ref. 41) and expression of a cassette of pluripotency genes, such as OCT4 (POU5F1), NANOG and STELLAR (DPPA3P2) (Refs 3, 41, 42). In murine ES cells, it was recently described that Oct4 regulates transcription of the miR-17/106b seed family members, including miR-17-5p, miR-106a and miR-20a (Ref. 43). The miR-

106b seed family has been implied in embryonal stem cell maintenance, control of differentiation (Ref. 44) and fine-tuning of p21 expression, via inhibition of p21 translation by binding to the p21 3′-UTR (Refs 40, 45, 46, 47, 48). In cisplatin-sensitive TC cell lines and the EC component of chemo-sensitive tumours, low levels of cytoplasmic p21 similarly correlated with high expression of Oct4 and of miRs belonging to the miR-17/106b seed family (Ref. 40).

P53 activity can be influenced by MDM2. By binding to the transactivation domain of p53, MDM2 negatively regulates p53 activity and stability via several mechanisms such as stimulating p53 nuclear export and promoting p53 degradation through ubiquitination, (Ref. 49). MDM2 is a nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling protein (Ref. 50), mainly present in the nucleus of untreated TC cells, whereas p53 was found predominantly localised to the cytoplasm of TC cells (Ref. 51). In addition, the functionality of MDM2 is known to be strongly dependent on the expression levels of p14/Arf (p14) and MDM4 (Ref. 52). The p14 protein directly binds and inactivates MDM2 (Refs 53, 54, 55) thus segregating MDM2 from p53 (Ref. 56). However, p14 could not be detected in TC cells (Ref. 57), suggesting that p53 activity is controlled by MDM2 in untreated TC cells.

Furthermore, high expression of the miR-371–373 cluster was observed in TC, which mimics mutated TP53 by targeting the tumour suppressor gene protein LATS-2, involved in the regulation of G₁–S transition in the cell cycle (Ref. 58). Moreover, in TC, in contrast to other solid tumour types, the DNA-damage response (DDR) machinery is rarely activated spontaneously (Refs 59, 60). Therefore, no selective pressure on aberrations of the DDR genes, such as TP53, ATM / ATR and CHK2 is required for survival (Refs 59, 60).

cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair and/or apoptosis (Refs 61, 62, 63). Repair of cisplatin-DNA adducts is mainly performed through nucleotide excision repair (NER). When cisplatin-induced DNA crosslinks are not repaired using NER, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) may accumulate during replication. Such DNA DSBs activate the upstream DDR kinases ATM and DNA-PK (and indirectly also ATR), which in turn activate many down-stream targets, including p53, to mediate cell cycle arrest, initiate DNA repair and/or induce apoptosis (Ref. 64). In response to DNA damage, a variety of post-translational modifications of p53 are induced (Refs 65, 66, 67). However, conflicting data about the importance of these p53 modifications have been published (Refs 68, 69). Phosphorylation of MDM2 and MDM4 by ATM results in decreased activity and stability of the two proteins and the loss of a negative feedback on p53 (Refs 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75). The activation of the p53 pathway, in turn, leads to cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair, or apoptosis through the p53-dependent intrinsic and/or extrinsic apoptosis pathway (Refs 7, 8, 9, 61, 62, 63).

### Cisplatin-induced DDR in wild-type p53 expressing testicular cancer

Sensitivity of TC to cisplatin might be determined by efficient influx, activation and/or accessibility of the DNA to cisplatin. In turn, resistance to cisplatin could be due to the unsuccessful achievement of adequate intracellular levels of cisplatin, by a reduction in drug uptake, an increase in drug export or an increase in intracellular detoxification (Ref. 76). However, in TC, not much difference was observed in access of cisplatin to DNA, comparing cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant TC cell lines to other tumour cell types (Refs 2, 35, 36, 76, 77, 78).

Testicular cancers, in contrast to other more resistant tumour types (Refs 79, 80) are known to express very low levels of the essential NER components ERCC1, XPF and XPA (Refs 81, 82, 83, 84, 85). Low levels of ERCC1 and XPF are rate-limiting for the repair of especially interstrand crosslinks in TC cells, which could explain their cisplatin sensitivity (Ref. 86). In addition, a recent paper reported that TC cell lines have reduced homologous recombination activity, which correlated with their high cisplatin sensitivity (Ref. 87). It is interesting that all TC cell lines could be further sensitised by a

### Cisplatin sensitivity of testicular cancer

Canonical cisplatin-induced DDR in wild-type p53 expressing cells

Intracellular, cisplatin becomes biologically active by the aquation of one or both of the two chloride groups, so that it can covalently bind to DNA, thereby forming DNA adducts (Ref. 61). These adducts cause inter- and intrastrand DNA cross-links and distortions in DNA, including unwinding and bending (Refs 61, 62). This process activates various signal-transduction pathways involved in the DDR leading to

combination of cisplatin with a clinically applicable PARP inhibitor (AZD2281, olaparib) (Ref. 87). A third DNA repair system involved in cisplatin-induced DNA lesions, is the mismatch repair system (MMR). Losses or defects in MMR, as reflected in reduced microsatellite stability, can confer resistance to cisplatin. In several studies, however, TCs were found to be microsatellite stable, suggesting that the mismatch repair system (MMR) system is functional in most TCs (Refs 88, 89).

### Cisplatin-induced apoptosis in testicular cancer

Treatment with cisplatin leads to rapid induction of apoptosis in TC cell lines (Fig. 2a) (Refs 35, 90, 91, 92). A major role for p53 has been described in the response to chemotherapeutic drugs, such as cisplatin (Refs 10, 11, 12, 13, 14). Several studies have shown that cisplatin can activate, via p53, the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway in parallel in cancer cells from various tumour types, (Refs 93, 94, 95, 96). Cisplatin causes enhanced Fas death receptor expression and activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway via the Fas/Fas ligand interaction in TC cells (Ref. 97). Activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway following cisplatin treatment was also observed in these cells (Refs 97, 98, 99). Cross-talk between the extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis pathway amplifies apoptotic signalling, since Fas signalling leads to caspase-8 induced cleavage of Bid and in turn, cleaved Bid can activate the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Refs 100, 101). Blocking the Fas apoptosis pathway reduced apoptosis to a large extent in TC cells at low cisplatin doses, but was less effective at higher cisplatin doses, suggesting a difference in cisplatin-concentration-dependent activation between the two apoptosis pathways in TC cells (Ref. 97). In contrast to other wild-type p53 expressing tumour cell types, cisplatin-sensitive TC cells display cisplatin-induced up-regulation of p53, MDM2 and the pro-apoptotic proteins Fas, and Noxa, while levels of p21 are much less affected (Refs 16, 40, 47, 51, 57, 97, 102, 103, 104). The important role of wild-type TP53 in the response to cisplatin was demonstrated in cisplatin-sensitive Tera cells. Suppression of p53 resulted in down-regulation of p53-transactivated genes implicated in the extrinsic apoptosis pathway (FAS, LRDD and PHLDA3) and the intrinsic

apoptosis pathway (Puma, Noxa) (Refs 57, 98, 103, 104) and caused a concomitant reduction in cisplatin sensitivity (Refs 57, 98, 103). The low expression levels of cytoplasmic p21 are causative in the sensitivity of TC cells to cisplatin and Fas-mediated apoptosis (Refs 16, 40, 57). Several possible anti-apoptotic functions of high cytoplasmic p21 levels have been described in other tumour types that are strongly related to Fas-induced apoptosis. Upon Fas activation, Fas is trimerised followed by Daxx recruitment to the receptor. Daxx then interacts with ASK1, which results in the activation of JNK/SAPK and p38, and concomitantly apoptosis induction. This process is blocked by cytoplasmic p21 binding to ASK1 (Refs 105, 106, 107). In addition, following activation of Fas, CDK2 activity is induced in a caspase-dependent way leading to cross-activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway (Refs 108, 109, 110). Functional interaction of CDK2 with FOXO1 after DNA damage was found to be an important mechanism to induce, among others, Fas ligand expression and thus promote activation of the Fas pathway (Ref. 111). Since p21 binds to ASK1 and CDK2 in cisplatin-resistant TC cells (Ref. 40), it can be hypothesised that both play a role in Fas-mediated apoptosis in TC cells. Interestingly, evidence for a pro-apoptotic role of CDK2 in TC cell lines was recently demonstrated. Thus, it will be interesting to further unravel how ASK1 and CDK2 interact with the apoptosis pathways in TC cells. Two recent studies showed that the pro-apoptotic p53 target gene Noxa (signalling in the intrinsic apoptosis pathway) plays a prominent role in cisplatin-induced apoptosis in TC cells (Refs 98, 112). High levels of Oct4 strongly correlated with high expression of Noxa, while Oct4 suppression led to a strong reduction in Noxa expression (Ref. 113). Interestingly, Noxa was found to be significantly higher expressed in tumours of TC patients with blood markers predicting a good clinical prognosis (Ref. 112).

As discussed before, Oct4 is instrumental in regulating p21 expression levels and p21 was correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin in vivo and in vitro (Refs 16, 40, 114). Taken together, these results indicate that TC cells are primed to the pro-apoptotic functions of p53 due to high Oct4 levels and concomitantly elevated Noxa and reduced p21 protein levels (Fig. 2a).

Cisplatin resistance in testicular cancer

Resistance to cisplatin in TC cells could not be explained by differences in uptake or cisplatin access to DNA comparing cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant cells (Refs 2, 35, 36, 76, 77, 78). Alternatively, cisplatin resistance might be due to testis-specific expression of high mobility group (HMG)-box proteins, which can mask DNA adducts and prevent damage detection by NER factors, as found in murine TC cell lines (Ref. 115). The base excision repair (BER) system, which eliminates small base alterations without distorting the DNA helix, seems to be important for the repair of irradiation- or bleomycin-induced DNA damage in TC cells, but its role in cisplatin resistance is still not clear (Refs 116, 117). A recent study described high MSI levels in refractory and late-relapsing TCs that were partially overlapping with the presence of activating mutations within the BRAF (V600E) oncogene (Refs 118, 119, 120). To date, unfortunately, no TC cell lines are described with high MSI and/or BRAF V600E mutation, limiting functional studies.

Resistance to cisplatin has been attributed to inactivation of p53 at the genetic or protein level in many tumour types (Ref. 121). In contrast, only in a subset of refractory TC, resistance to cisplatin was directly linked to TP53 mutations (Ref. 26), indicating that aberrances in the components that regulate the p53 pathway play a more important role in the cisplatin resistance of TC. Intrinsic cisplatin-resistant TC cells were found to have higher expression of p53, MDM2 and p21 and lower expression of Oct4 and Noxa prior to cisplatin treatment (Refs 16, 40, 57, 98, 102, 112, 113, 114, 122). Despite an almost similar increase in cisplatin-induced p53 levels, MDM2 and p21 increased significantly more in

cisplatin-treated intrinsic resistant TC cells, when compared with cisplatin-treated sensitive TC cells (Refs 40, 57, 102, 122). In contrast to the pro-apoptotic role of p53 in cisplatin-sensitive Tera cells, p53 protected intrinsic cisplatin-resistant TC cells against cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Ref. 57). The anti-apoptotic role of p53 in the cisplatin-resistant model may be due to its role as transcriptional activator of p21, a protein that was predominantly expressed in the intrinsic cisplatin-resistant TC cells (Refs 40, 57, 102, 122) and shown to be important in inhibiting apoptosis when cytoplasmically localised (Refs 38, 39, 105, 106, 107, 123). In addition, MDM2 as an important negative feedback regulator of p53 (Refs 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75) might influence cisplatin responses in TC. Moreover, loss of pluripotency/Oct4 is associated with a decreased cisplatin response. The importance of the p53/MDM2 axis, Noxa, loss of pluripotency/Oct4 and p21 in cisplatin-resistance of TC cells is discussed hereafter (Fig. 2b).

The p53/MDM2 axis

MDM2 is an important negative feedback regulator of p53, and MDM2 activity towards p53 is regulated by phosphorylation of MDM2. ATM-mediated phosphorylation of MDM2 inhibits its ability to poly-ubiquitinate p53, and is likely to be the key step in causing p53 stabilisation following DNA-damage. Alternatively, Akt can bind and phosphorylate MDM2, leading to its nuclear localisation and consequently enhanced MDM2-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of p53 (Refs 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75). Therefore, tight regulation of p53 by MDM2, fine-tuned through phosphorylation by ATM and Akt, may be of importance for the response to cisplatin in TC. Of interest, intrinsic cisplatin-

Figure 2. The role of wild-type p53, Oct4, Noxa, MDM2, p21 and Fas in cisplatin sensitivity and resistance of testicular cancer. (Legend; see previous page for figure.) Cisplatin-induced DNA damage activates p53, which in turn transcribes MDM2, Noxa, Fas and p21, and activates the Fas apoptosis pathway and the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. MDM2 is important for regulating p53 transcriptional activity, Akt is important for dynamic shuttling of p21 from the nucleus towards the cytoplasm, while cytoplasmic p21 can block apoptosis. Oct4 regulates Noxa and miR-17/106b seed family members (miR-17/106b) that are involved in regulating p21 expression levels. (a) Cisplatin-sensitive cells are characterised by low levels of MDM2 and p21, while expressing high levels of Oct4 and consequently high levels of Noxa and miR-17/106b seed family members. The low levels of p21 and MDM2 and high levels of Noxa result in efficient induction of apoptosis, after treatment with cisplatin. (b) Cisplatin-resistant cells have lower levels of Oct4, Noxa and miR-17/106b seed family members and high amounts of MDM2 and cytoplasmic p21, resulting in moderate levels of cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Solid black lines represent active signalling after cisplatin treatment and grey lines represent less active signalling.

resistant TC cells showed higher expression of MDM2, both untreated and after induction with cisplatin, compared with cisplatin-sensitive TC cells (Refs 51, 57, 102). In addition, p53 function was found impeded by the interaction with MDM2 and the subsequent sequestration of p53 in the cytoplasm of cisplatin-resistant TC cells (Ref. 51). In acquired cisplatin-resistant TC cells, a higher expression of PIK3R1 and GIGYF2 was observed compared with their parental cisplatin-sensitive TC cells (Ref. 124). Both PIK3R1 and GIGYF2 are involved in regulating PI3K/Akt activity (Refs 125, 126, 127, 128). These results indicate that enhanced activity of Akt, as seen in cisplatin-resistant cells, may stimulate the inhibitory effect of MDM2 on p53, leading to a higher threshold for the ATM to activate p53. Indeed, higher cisplatin concentrations were necessary to disturb p53/MDM2 complex formation in cisplatin-resistant cells (Ref. 51). Inhibition of MDM2, using siRNA or an MDM2/MDM4 blocking peptide led to up-regulation of p53, Fas and Puma and sensitised TC cell to cisplatin, while the increase in p21 levels was much less pronounced (Refs 51, 102). Taken together these observations show an important role for the p53/MDM2 axis in regulating cellular responses to cisplatin in TC.

### Differentiation and cisplatin resistance in testicular cancer

Expression profiling of TC tumour subtypes showed differential expression of core stem cell genes, such as Oct4, NANOG and STELLAR, comparing EC and seminoma to the other subtypes (Refs 129, 130, 131, 132, 133). Several of these pluripotency genes were higher expressed in untreated versus cisplatin-treated tumours. Moreover, the gene expression signature predicting outcome of cisplatin-treated TC also suggested that good outcome genes are associated with immune-related functions and pathways responsible for repression of differentiation (Ref. 132). High expression levels of Oct4 in xenografts TC models, cell lines and tumours were also highly correlated with cisplatin response (Refs 40, 47, 113, 114, 134, 135).

### Onset of differentiation and cisplatin resistance, a major role for Oct4, Noxa and p21

Genes and pathways associated with active development and differentiation, most notably neural development, were significantly enriched in tumours from poor-outcome patients (Ref. 132). At the molecular level, loss of Oct4 has been associated with cisplatin-resistance in TC, both in vitro and in vivo and strongly correlated with lower pro-apoptotic Noxa and higher anti-apoptotic p21 expression levels (Refs 40, 47, 112, 113, 114). High levels of cytoplasmically localized p21 are detectable in the EC component of the majority of tumours from refractory testicular cancer patients, including two tumours consisting of the EC component only. This is in contrast with the low p21 levels present in the EC component of tumours from cisplatin-sensitive TC patients. (Refs 40, 47). Moreover, in chemo-refractory TC patients almost no Oct4, miR-17-5p and miR-106a were detected in the EC components, while high levels of these miRs and Oct4 were detected in the EC component of chemo-sensitive TC patients (Ref. 40). Suppression of Oct4 (or miR-17-5p in the context of p21) in the cisplatin-sensitive Tera cells resulted in up-regulation of cytoplasmic p21, down-regulation of Noxa and resistance to cisplatin (Refs 40, 47, 113). Hypoxia resulted in reduced stability of Oct4 protein and therefore lower levels of Oct4, subsequent elevation of cytoplasmic p21 levels and decreased sensitivity to cisplatin and bleomycin in a TC model both in vitro and in vivo (Ref. 114). Mimicking in vitro differentiation with retinoic acid also led to repression of Oct4, miR-17/106b seed family members and Noxa, an up-regulation of p21 and concomitantly higher resistance to cisplatin (Refs 42, 92, 98, 134, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140). The role of the miR-17/106b seed family members in the p21 expression in TC cells was further strengthened, since the overexpression of miR-17-5p led to reduced p21 expression levels and abolished cisplatin resistance in TC cells (Ref. 40). Other clinical observations indirectly point at Oct4, Noxa and p21 involvement in controlling cisplatin sensitivity. Residual vital mature teratoma is found in 30–40% of the patients after treatment with cisplatin-based chemotherapy, implying a selection for more differentiated components that are less chemo-sensitive (Refs 34, 141). Several studies have demonstrated that especially more differentiated TCs, such as teratomas abundantly express p21 and lack expression of Oct4 (Refs 24, 30, 31, 33, 40, 129). In addition, Noxa was significantly less
expressed in teratomas compared with seminomas and EC (using oncomine on the dataset of Korokola et al. (Ref. 131)). Teratomas, however, predominantly show a nuclear localisation of p21. These tumours are not proliferating, possibly due to a p21-mediated cell cycle arrest, and therefore not responsive to treatment with cisplatin (Refs 3, 17, 34, 129). However, occasionally an enlarging mature teratoma arises during or after chemotherapy, called the growing teratoma syndrome (Refs 34, 142), indicating an escape from cell cycle arrest. These growing teratomas appeared to be responsive to a selective CDK4/6 inhibitor, PD0332991 (Ref. 34). It is tempting to speculate about a possible redistribution of p21 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm in this syndrome allowing progression through the cell cycle, but so far no data are available. Together these observations show a direct connection between Noxa and cytoplasmic p21 expression, regulated by Oct4 and resistance of testicular cancers to cisplatin.

### Other molecular events associated with differentiation and cisplatin resistance

TCs originate from the carcinoma in situ cells (CIS), which are derived from primordial germ cells (PGCs) (Refs 143, 144, 145, 146). During normal embryogenesis, germ cells arise as pluripotent PGCs that differentiate ultimately into the cells and tissues of an adult gonad (Refs 147, 148). During differentiation from PGC to adult gonad the expression of most of the pluripotency genes is lost. Differentiation from embryonal carcinomas to either choriocarcinomas, YS tumours or teratomas is a highly similar process. Within these differentiated TC subtypes, many genes have been identified that are associated with the specific histology relating to their normal cellular counterparts. The ChC subtype highly expresses several pregnancy-associated and placenta-associated genes, such as both subunits for hCG (Refs 131, 132, 149). The presence of metastatic choriocarcinoma indicates a poor prognosis independent from any form of treatment (Refs 4, 150, 151) and hCG is a biochemical marker of poor prognosis/worse outcome for TC (Ref. 152). It is tempting to speculate that high p21 expression levels observed in ChC (Refs 153, 154) are related to these clinical observations. The YS subtype is characterised by the expression of markers of extra-embryonic endoderm,

including AFP, normally expressed in the YS of developing embryos (Refs 129, 131, 132, 149). AFP is a biochemical marker of poor prognosis / worse outcome in TC (Ref. 152) and many late relapses of TC show pure YS histology (Ref. 120). Another top-scoring gene in the YS signature is PTPN13 (Ref. 129), also known as Fas-associated phosphatase-1 (FAP-1), which was found to interact with the Fas receptor and inhibits Fas-mediated programmed cell death (Refs 155, 156). In addition, molecular profiling showed that lost expression of pro-apoptotic ASK-1 (MAP3K5) and gained expression of anti-apoptotic C-FLIP (CFLAR) correlated with poor prognosis of TC (Ref. 132). Both ASK-1 and C-FLIP are involved in Fas-induced apoptosis and viral expression of C-FLIP in Tera cells inhibited cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Ref. 97). Pro-apoptotic functioning of ASK-1 is blocked by cytoplasmic p21 binding to ASK-1 (Refs 105, 106, 107), which was actually observed in TC cells (Ref. 40).

Once normal embryonal cells are committed to somatic differentiation, Oct4 is rapidly and permanently silenced by DNA methylation (Refs 157, 158) and such epigenetic changes are necessary for normal development and maturation of germ cells (Ref. 159). Foetal germ cells, CIS and seminomas generally have hypomethylated DNA, embryonal carcinomas show an intermediate pattern, while more differentiated TCs (YS tumours, choriocarcinomas and teratomas) show a higher degree of DNA methylation (Refs 159, 160, 161, 162, 163). DNA methylation is conducted by the DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) family of enzymes, and family members DNMT3A and DNMT3B are primarily responsible for establishing de novo methylation (Ref. 164). The shift of methylation status may be associated with the DNMT3B and DNMT3L genes that are specifically highly expressed in EC (Refs 130, 131, 133, 149, 165). Not only methylation of Oct4 but also of NANOG correlated with the differentiation status. Demethylation resulted in re-expression of Oct4 and NANOG (Refs 158, 162, 166) arguing that both are under the influence of differentiation-induced DNA methylation in TC. DNA methylation in TC was found associated with resistance to therapy and may regulate sensitivity to chemotherapy in a gene-specific manner (Refs 162, 163, 167).

and ChC cell lines using 5-azacytidine (5-aza) resulted in (re)expression of the pluripotency markers NANOG and Oct4 (Refs 158, 162). In contrast, low dose 5-aza treatment in a cisplatin-sensitive EC cell line down-regulated genes associated with pluripotency, including NANOG (Ref. 168). The contrasting results of 5-aza treatment in EC cells compared with seminomas and ChC cells might be explained by the explicitly high expression levels of DNMT3B in EC cells (Refs 168, 169).

### How to translate this knowledge into better therapeutic strategies

Further understanding of chemo-sensitivity and -resistance of TC tumours will contribute to the design of new rational combination treatments. Most newly tested drugs showed disappointing results in this subgroup of refractory testicular cancer patients. Very recent data in testicular cancer patients who responded poorly on first line chemotherapy showed that adapting the chemotherapy with other active drugs can improve outcome (Ref. 170). This illustrates that adding active drugs to standard treatment may improve the outcome of poor risk testicular cancer. The most striking differences between cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant TC cells are the significantly lower levels of Oct4, miR-17/106b seed family and Noxa, elevated p53/MDM2 complexes and higher levels of cytoplasmic p21 in the latter. Therefore, influencing the p53/MDM2 axis, cytoplasmically localised p21 or Oct4 expression may sensitise TC cells to cisplatin, which is discussed in the next paragraph (Fig. 3a and b).

#### Targeting the p53/MDM2 axis

In cisplatin-resistant TC cells, the p53 function was shown to be impeded through enhanced interaction with MDM2 (Ref. 51). Therefore, interfering in the p53–MDM2 interaction with small molecules, like Nutlin-3a, provides an attractive strategy for (re)activating wild-type p53 in a non-genotoxic way. Nutlin-3a inhibits the interaction between MDM2 and p53 by binding MDM2 in the p53-binding pocket leading to the stabilisation of p53 (Ref. 73). At minimally cytotoxic concentrations, Nutlin-3a sensitised wild-type p53 expressing TC cells to cisplatin (Fig. 3a) (Refs 51, 102, 171). Nutlin-3a treatment, as single agent, caused a high induction of p53 and Puma protein expression and Fas membrane expression and strongly reduced survival in both cisplatin-resistant and -sensitive TC cell lines, by inducing massive apoptosis (Refs 51, 98, 102). Combining non-toxic concentrations of Nutlin-3a with cisplatin led to a further activation of the p53 pathway and the Fas/FasL death receptor pathway and sensitised both intrinsic as well as acquired cisplatin-resistant TC cells to very low concentrations of cisplatin (Refs 51). Blocking of the Fas/FasL death receptor pathway impaired apoptosis induction of Nutlin-3a as well as Nutlin-3a combined with cisplatin in TC cells (Refs 51). After Nutlin-3a treatment or cisplatin treatment, p21 mRNA and protein levels remained relatively low in TC cells (Refs 16, 40, 51, 57, 97, 102), especially compared with other tumour cell lines (Refs 16, 102), although, the occupancy of p53 on the CDKN1A (p21) promoter in TC cells showed similar levels (Ref. 102). Different co-factors of p53 might differentially influence the balance by facilitating and activating pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic promoters (Refs 49, 70, 72, 172, 173, 174, 175). NFX is such a co-factor and was shown to inhibit CDKN1A (p21) promoter activity, whereas at the TNFRSF6 promoter it enhances

(a) Interfering in the p53-MDM2 interaction with small molecules, like Nutlin-3a, or suppression of MDM2 substantially induced Fas and Puma expression, resulting in apoptosis of both cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant TC cells. Cisplatin in combination with Nutlin-3a further enhanced Fas expression and sensitised cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant TC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis. Thick black lines represent hyper-activated pro-apoptotic signalling, due to treatment. (b) Deactivation of Akt with LY294002, Triciribine or siRNA against Akt sensitises cisplatin-resistant cells. Deactivation of Akt leads to nuclear localisation of p21, which in turn is no longer capable of blocking cisplatin-induced apoptosis. In other tumour types deactivation of Akt interferes with the inhibitory effect of MDM2 on p53, leading to a higher activity of p53. In addition, 5-aza treatment results in sensitisation to cisplatin and (re)expression of Oct4. In turn, Oct4 regulates expression of miR-17/106b seed family members that are involved in regulating p21 expression levels, and Noxa expression. Dotted grey lines represent inactivated signalling, due to treatment.**

transcription (Ref. 172, 173), indicating that inhibition of the negative feedback on p53 in TC turns the balance in favour of transcription of pro-apoptotic genes, such as TNFRSF6, encoding Fas and BBC3 (Puma). This needs to be further elucidated, especially since, in contrast to TC, in most other solid tumour cells MDM2 inhibitors, as single agents, mainly induce cell cycle arrest (Refs 176, 177), probably through p21. Of interest, stapled peptides targeting MDM2 are in pre-clinical development and can target both the p53-MDM2 and p53-MDM4 interaction (Refs 178, 179). In melanoma, for instance, it was shown that inhibition of the p53-MDM2 interaction only had minimal apoptotic effects. In contrast, inhibiting the p53-MDM4 interaction, using a stapled peptide, restored the wild-type p53 activity in melanoma cells resulting in increased sensitivity to chemotherapy and BRAF inhibitors (Ref. 180). In testicular cancer cell lines, however, the negative feedback of MDM4 on p53 appeared to be moderate and cell line-dependent (Ref. 102).

The results discussed here suggest that the activation of the complex DNA damage-induced p53 pathway, with MDM2 as feedback mechanism fine-tuning the p53 response, seems to play a crucial role in balancing the chemotherapy response of TC. Moreover, efficient activation of the p53-induced pro-apoptotic pathway by antagonising MDM2 overrules the anti-apoptotic effect of p21 in response to cisplatin-induced DNA damage in TC. Currently, three MDM2 inhibitors, i.e. RG7112, a Nutlin-3a based molecule (RO5045337 – Roche), another MDM2 inhibitor (RO5503781 – Roche) and Kevetrin (Cellectix Pharmaceuticals), have entered phase I clinical trials in haematological malignancies and (advanced) solid tumours.

Disrupting the p53–MDM2 interaction, especially, in combination with cisplatin, enhanced Fas death receptor-mediated apoptosis in TC cells (Ref. 51). Interestingly, apoptosis induction, after combining Nutlin-3a and cisplatin, was not only most pronounced in cisplatin-resistant TC cells but also in cisplatin-resistant cells from other tumour types (Refs 51, 181). Hence, targeting the p53-MDM2 interaction in combination with standard cisplatin-based treatment is a therapeutic strategy warranted to pursue. Since Fas expression is strongly induced by this combination, additional activation of the extrinsic apoptosis pathway by administration

of FasL might be an interesting approach. But apart from a hexameric form of FasL (APO010) (Ref. 182) that had entered a phase 1 clinical trial in 2007, no Fas targeting drugs are available. Moreover, combining cisplatin with agents targeting inhibitors of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway, such as Obatoclax, ABT-199 or ABT-263 (Navitoclax), might be favourable for treatment of cisplatin-resistant/refractory TCs.

In addition, these non-genotoxic strategies might be beneficial for all metastatic TCs leading to a reduction of the standard of care chemotherapy doses, since many who are cured using cisplatin-based chemotherapy will develop serious late toxicities (Refs 183, 184).

Strategies to target cytoplasmic p21 and/or (re)express Oct4

Increased levels of cytoplasmically localised p21 are a key determinant of cisplatin-resistance in TC cells (Ref. 40). Cytoplasmic localisation of p21 is caused by PI3K/Akt-mediated phosphorylation of p21 in TC (Ref. 40) and other cancers, such as ovarian, breast and kidney cancer (Refs 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190). Cytoplasmically localised p21 can be re-localised towards the nucleus by dephosphorylation of p21, using triciribine, an Akt inhibitor currently in phase 1/2 trials, depletion of Akt using RNA interference or application of the pan PI3 K inhibitor LY294002. Relocalisation of p21 caused a loss of complex formation of p21 with pro-apoptotic CDK2 and sensitised cisplatin-resistant TC cells to cisplatin-induced apoptosis (Fig. 3b) (Ref. 40). In other tumour types for which cisplatin is used as first-line therapy, cytoplasmic p21 levels were found to be strongly associated with poor treatment outcome (Refs 186, 187, 190, 191), arguing that in these cancers inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway in combination with cisplatin might be beneficial as well. Therefore, the use of PI3K/Akt inhibitors (Ref. 192) seems to be a therapeutically interesting approach. Whether inhibitors currently in clinical trial, such as the Akt inhibitors triciribine, perifosine and MK-2206, the PI3 K inhibitors SF1126, PX-866, BKM120 or GDC-0941 are effective, especially when combined with cisplatin, needs to be elucidated.

In addition, PI3K/Akt might be inhibited by targeting upstream tyrosine kinase membrane receptors such as KIT, ERBB2, PDGFR and

VEGFRs that have been implicated in TC (Refs 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199, 200, 201, 202). Of interest, sunitinib, as single agent, inhibited tumour growth in an orthotopic cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant patient-derived ChC model of TC and inhibited cell growth of cisplatin-sensitive and -resistant TC cell lines (Refs 203, 204). Disappointingly, only modest activity of sunitinib was observed in heavily pretreated TC patients (Ref. 204). Sunitinib, however, synergised with cisplatin in the patient derived cisplatin-resistant ChC orthotopic model (Refs 203), arguing that PI3K/Akt inhibition might be especially effective when combined with cisplatin.

In addition, treatment with 5-aza sensitised an intrinsic cisplatin-resistant seminoma cell line to cisplatin, while restoring cisplatin sensitivity of acquired cisplatin-resistant EC cells (Refs 162, 169). In contrast, a clinical trial with 5-aza, as single agent, did not show any activity in cisplatin pretreated TC patients (Ref. 205). This might be due to treatment with 5-aza only, since the combination with carboplatin has shown activity in other platinum-resistant solid tumours such as ovarian cancer (Ref. 206). Besides sensitising cisplatin-resistant TC cells to cisplatin, 5-aza treatment resulted in (re)expression of Oct4. As discussed before, Oct4 is correlated with sensitivity to cisplatin and was shown to be instrumental in lowering anti-apoptotic p21 and enhancing pro-apoptotic Noxa expression levels in TC. Therefore, we hypothesise that 5-aza-mediated (re)expression of Oct4 primes the TC cells for cisplatin-induced apoptosis among others by influencing p21 and Noxa levels.

### Conclusions

Based on our own studies and the literature presented, we conclude that the low levels and/or deficiency of proteins involved in DNA-repair are important in determining the sensitivity of TC to cisplatin. In addition, the presence of wild-type p53 protein and high levels of Oct4 and consequently high cellular levels of pro-apoptotic Noxa protein and miR-17/106b seed family members and low cytoplasmic levels of anti-apoptotic p21 protein are important parameters for the exquisite sensitivity of TC cells to cisplatin. The data reviewed here imply that p53 can either have a pro-apoptotic or an anti-apoptotic role in the response to cisplatin depending on the cellular context. The low Oct4 and Noxa levels and high p53-dependent

expression of MDM2 and cytoplasmic p21 largely defines the cisplatin-resistance context, although other factors cannot be excluded. To overcome cisplatin resistance or enhance cisplatin sensitivity of TC cells three pro-apoptotic strategies targeting MDM2, Oct4, Noxa and/or p21 have been identified; firstly, antagonising the MDM2-mediated negative feed-back of p53 with MDM2 inhibitors such as Nutlin-3a; secondly, relocalisation of cytoplasmic p21 to the nucleus and/or enhancing activity of p53 using inhibitors of the PI3K/Akt pathway; and thirdly, DNA demethylation using 5-aza to (re)express Oct4. Further validation of these strategies in vivo TC models has to be performed.

A limitation of TC cell lines might be the EC origin of most cell line models. The relevance of these models, however, has been demonstrated in EC samples from cisplatin-sensitive TC patients, showing the expression of wild-type p53 protein, Oct4 and Noxa, low levels of p21 protein and a deregulated G1/S checkpoint. In addition, high levels of cytoplasmic p21 and low levels of Oct4, Noxa and miR-17/106b seed family members were features of EC tumours of refractory TC patients similar to the observations in TC cell line models. Since loss of Oct4 expression is closely related to a higher differentiation status and a feature of poor-outcome TC patients, additional models should also take into account the other subtypes of TC, i.e. choriocarcinomas, YS tumours and teratomas, when studying cisplatin-sensitivity and -resistance of TC. Some EC cell line models are well known for the capacity to differentiate in vivo (Ref. 207) and are therefore useful in vivo models, but the number of TC cell lines with this ability is limited. Other in vivo TC models, even more closely reflecting the clinical situation, are the orthotopic and subcutaneous patient-derived testicular cancer xenografts in mice, as described previously (Refs 203, 208). The patient derived TC xenografts, displaying the various components or mixed components, will enable investigation of cisplatin sensitivity and -resistance and testing of novel therapeutic drugs, preferably in combination with cisplatin-based chemotherapy.

In conclusion, the unique sensitivity of TC has revealed several mechanistic insights. Further understanding of chemo-sensitivity and -resistance of TC tumours will contribute to the

design of new rational combination treatments
to overcome cisplatin resistance of refractory
testicular cancers. Validation of these combinations
in TC patients as proof of concept may stimulate
the development of novel treatment strategies for
other tumour types as well.
