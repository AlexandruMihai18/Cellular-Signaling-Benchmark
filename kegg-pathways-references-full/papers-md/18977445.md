ABSTRACT

Upon primary infection, EBV establishes a latent infection in B cells, characterized by maintenance of the viral genome in the absence of viral replication. The Epstein-Barr Nuclear Antigen 1 (EBNA1) plays a crucial role in maintenance of the viral DNA episome and is consistently expressed in all EBV-associated malignancies. Compared to other EBV latent gene products, EBNA1 is poorly recognized by CD8⁺ T lymphocytes. Recent studies are discussed that shed new light on the mechanisms that underlie this unusual lack of CD8⁺ T cell activation.

Whereas the latent phase is characterized by the expression of a limited subset of viral gene products, the full repertoire of over 80 EBV lytic gene products is expressed during the replicative phase. Despite this abundance of potential T cell antigens, which indeed give rise to a strong response of CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T lymphocytes, the virus can replicate successfully. Evidence is accumulating that this paradoxical situation is the result of actions of multiple viral gene products, inhibiting discrete stages of the MHC class I and class II antigen presentation pathways.

Immediately after initiation of the lytic cycle, BNLF2a prevents peptide-loading of MHC class I molecules through inhibition of the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing, TAP. This will reduce presentation of viral antigens by the large ER-resident pool of MHC class I molecules. Synthesis of new MHC class I molecules is blocked by BGLF5. Viral-IL10 causes a reduction in mRNA levels of TAP1 and bli/LMP2, a subunit of the immunoproteasome. MHC class I molecules present at the cell surface are downregulated by BILF1. Also the antigen presenting capacity of MHC class II molecules is severely compromised by multiple EBV lytic gene products, including gp42/gH/gL, BGLF5, and vIL-10. In this review, we discuss how concerted actions of these EBV lytic proteins result in highly effective interference with CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T cell surveillance, thereby providing the virus with a window for undisturbed generation of viral progeny.

## 1. Introduction

CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic T cells (CTL) play an important role in the control of viral infections by their ability to recognize viral peptides presented by MHC class I molecules (Fig. 1). Peptides are generated by proteasomal degradation of proteins or protein fragments (e.g., defective ribosomal products, DRiPs). The resulting peptides are transported into the ER lumen by the Transporter associated with Antigen Processing (TAP). Peptides are loaded onto newly synthesized MHC class I molecules, which are transported to the cell surface where they can be recognized by CTL's. CD4<sup>+</sup> T-helper cells are crucial as well for effective antiviral immunity: they are essential for the induction and maintenance of cytotoxic T cell responses, can exert cytolytic activity themselves, and provide help for humoral immune responses. Generally, peptides recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are derived from exogenous antigens, taken up by cells via the endocytic pathway (Fig. 2). Peptide-loading of newly synthesized MHC class II molecules in the ER is prevented by the invariant chain, which occludes the peptide binding site of the class II complex via its Class II Invariant Chain Peptide (CLIP)-domain. MHC class IIαβ-invariant chain complexes are directed to the MHC class II-loading Compartment (MIIC) via a targeting signal within the cytoplasmic tail of the invariant chain. In the MIIC, the invariant chain is degraded by proteolytic enzymes. CLIP is removed as well and peptides, delivered into the MIIC via the endocytic pathway, are loaded onto the liberated peptide binding site of the MHC class II complexes via a reaction that is regulated by two accessory molecules, DM and DO. Properly loaded MHC class II IIαβ-peptide complexes migrate to the cell surface, where their content will be sampled by T cell receptors carried by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. As will be discussed.

**Fig. 2. EBV interference with MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation.** The BZLF2-encoded gp42 associates with MHC class II molecules in the ER and accompanies the MHC class II complexes to the cell surface. Gp42 does not interfere with peptide-loading of the MHC class II molecules. At the cell surface, the presence of gp42 within the MHC class II complex blocks proper interaction with T cell receptors of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Proteolytic cleavage of gp42 in the ER results in a soluble form that is capable of associating with MHC class II molecules intracellularly. The soluble gp42 is secreted and may inhibit antigen presentation via MHC class II molecules *in trans*. At present, it is unclear how non-MHC class II-associated soluble gp42 reaches the cell surface. BGLF5 blocks MHC class II synthesis through its virion host-shutoff function.

**Fig. 1. EBV interference with MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation.** EBNA1 inhibits the generation of peptides *in cis* by reducing its own translation and by interfering with its proteasomal degradation through an internal glycine-alanine repeat. BNLF2a prevents the import of peptides into the ER by TAP by blocking the binding of both peptides and ATP to the transporter complex. BGLF5 inhibits the synthesis of host cell proteins, including MHC class I molecules, through its virus host-shutoff function. vIL-10 downregulates MHC class I expression at the cell surface by targeting MHC class I molecules for lysosomal degradation. vIL-10, the product of the lytic phase BCRF-1 gene, decreases the mRNA and, consequently, the protein levels of TAP1 and b1i/LMP2, a subunit of the immunoproteasome that shares a bidirectional promoter with the TAP1 gene. BZLF1 inhibits the LMP1-induced upregulation of MHC class I mRNA levels.

cussed below, EBV effectively interferes with antigen presentation via both the MHC class I and class II antigen presentation pathways. Each EBV immune evasion protein employs a unique strategy to achieve its goal.

B cells latently infected with EBV express a limited subset of up to 11 genes with concomitant cell proliferation [1]. The pathogenicity of EBV-transformed B cells *in vivo* is counteracted by potent T-cell responses directed towards several latent antigens [2]. Indeed such EBV-specific T cells can be used to successfully treat EBV-associated lymphomas that arise in immunosuppressed patients [3,4]. During latency, downregulated expression of EBV antigens by the infected cell is a major mechanism contributing to effective avoidance of elimination by T cells [1,5,6]. In addition, some of the EBV latent gene products have been found to employ highly effective strategies to prevent recognition by CD8⁺ T cells *in cis*. EBNA1 is a typical example of this, as it inhibits its own processing into antigenic peptides through post-transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms (discussed in more detail below). Other latent gene products, such as the *Epstein-Barr virus*-encoded small RNAs (EBERs), have a more general anti-inflammatory effect. These non-coding double-stranded RNA-like molecules, existing abundantly in EBV-infected cells, have recently been found to induce the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 [7].

Transmission of EBV to another host requires production of infectious virus as occurs in the lytic phase. The chances for successful viral spread increase with the amount of progeny released and this depends on the lifespan of the EBV-producing cell. In general, lytically infected cells remain viable for at least 5 days [8]. During this period, more than 80 EBV-encoded proteins are synthesized, creating a wide variety of targets for detection and destruction by the immune system. Abundant memory T cells are generated following primary infection [2] and these will respond within a few hours after reactivation to eliminate cells harboring replicating virus, unless counteracted by EBV-encoded immunoevasins.

Interference with antiviral immunity during productive EBV infection has long remained underexplored due to the absence of an *in vitro* model to study EBV-producing cells. The development of an *in vitro* system for productive EBV infection [8] has permitted investigations into the strategies employed by EBV to counteract host immunity and has facilitated the identification of a number of specific EBV-encoded immune evasion molecules. Gradually, a more complete picture of EBV immune evasion strategies is emerging, revealing a plethora of mechanisms acting together. Here, the cooperative action of BNLF2a, BILF1, BGLF5, BCRF1, and BZLF2 in evasion of both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cell immunity during EBV lytic infection will be reviewed.

### 2. EBNA1, master of disguise

Expression of the Epstein-Barr virus nuclear protein, EBNA1, is widespread in all forms of EBV infection, accentuating its central role in the maintenance of the viral DNA episome [9,10], a process essential for viral persistence and associated oncogenic potential. EBNA1 achieves this by initiating DNA replication from the latent origin of replication (OriP), promoting stable segregation of latent EBV genomes during cell division and through transcriptional trans-activation of other EBV latent genes [11–13].

A wide range of studies have demonstrated that EBV latently infected B cells are able to escape immune recognition, due in part to an internal glycine-alanine repeat (GAr) domain within EBNA1, which prevents/limits MHC class I-restricted presentation of EBNA1 epitopes linked *in cis* [14–20]. Removal of this repeat sequence restores normal recognition of EBV-infected B cells and their subsequent destruction by virus-specific T cells (Fig. 3A). In order to avoid immune surveillance, EBNA1 expression must remain at low but sustainable levels to avoid immune detection but still at levels sufficient to maintain a presence within the infected cell.

Several groups examining the molecular basis by which the GAr suppresses immune recognition have proposed that the presence of the GAr domain within the EBNA1 protein may inhibit its proteasomal processing resulting in suppression of presentation of EBNA1-derived antigenic peptides through the MHC class I pathway [15]. Indeed, this hypothesis was confirmed by subsequent studies demonstrating that the GAr domain can directly interfere with the proteasomal degradation of EBNA1 and other reporter proteins to which it is fused [16,21–25]. Although a recent study has cast some doubt on the participation of the GAr in the proteasomal degradation of native EBNA1 [26], the balance of experimental data at present favors the involvement of the GAr in such a role. Caution is required when assessing conflicting reports of EBNA1 stability, as it has been reported that EBNA1 expression and function may be influenced by the nature of the epithelial cell background [27]. Jones and colleagues demonstrated that EBNA1 is toxic in specific epithelial cell environments and that this effect involves EBNA1 degradation, cell growth inhibition, induction of apoptosis and processing of EBNA1 for MHC class I presentation [27]. Further support for inhibition of proteasomal processing as an important EBNA1 immune evasion strategy, has been provided by the recent identification of a functionally related homologue of EBNA1, Latency Associated Nuclear Antigen 1 (LANA-1), from Kaposi Sarcoma Herpes-virus, which was also shown to block proteasomal degradation and inhibit presentation of linked epitopes through the MHC class I pathway [28]. It should be noted that the LANA-1 repeat does not share sequence similarity with EBNA1, but rather contains a long and strongly acidic domain. Interestingly, an engineered 40.7 kDa acidic protein, pGZr, encoded by a nested open reading frame of EBNA1 mRNA and displaying 65% amino acid sequence identity to the acidic repeat of LANA-1, also inhibited presentation of a linked antigen, prompting Ossevoort and colleagues to propose a potential ‘immuno-stealth’ role of GZr in gene therapy [29,30].

The other major protein degradation machinery present in eukaryotic cells besides the proteasome is the lysosomal protease system, which generates peptides for presentation on MHC class II products [31]. Studies carried out by Paludan and colleagues have shown that in contrast to MHC class I-restricted presentation of EBNA1 epitopes, the GAr domain shows very minimal interference with the endogenous presentation of EBNA1 epitopes through the class II pathway [32]. Endogenous processing of these EBNA1 epitopes occurs via macroautophagy, where the resulting presentation can be blocked by siRNA for Atg12 [32]. However, a number of other groups have shown that MHC class II-restricted epitopes from EBNA1 are poorly presented by EBV-infected B cells [33,34]. It is now well established that MHC class II-restricted presentation of the full-length EBNA1 protein, predominantly occurs through the exogenous pathway [35], while endogenous presentation may have a minimal contribution. It is feasible that the EBNA1 protein from dying virus-infected B cells is captured by live EBV-infected B cells and then loaded onto the class II molecules and this loading may access the autophagy-associated pathway. Indeed, Taylor and colleagues have reported that a number of class II epitopes from other EBNA proteins (e.g. EBNA3 and EBNA6) are loaded through this pathway [34]. A more detailed and careful analysis should be carried out to clearly delineate the mechanism by which EBNA1 avoids endogenous loading through the class II pathway.

In addition to the GAr’s putative role in inhibiting proteolysis, a study carried out by Yin et al. has reported that the GAr domain also inhibits EBNA1 self-synthesis and that this effect can be distinguished from its effect on proteasomal degradation [20]. The Khanna group [36] confirmed that the GAr does indeed

Fig. 3. Immune evasion strategies of EBNA1. (A) A GAr domain within the EBNA1 protein limits proteasomal processing resulting in suppression of MHC class I-restricted presentation of EBNA1 epitopes linked *in cis*. Removal of the GAr restores normal recognition of EBV-infected cells. Co-translational ubiquitination combined with N-end rule targeting enhances the intracellular degradation of full-length EBNA1. (B) The GAr domain also inhibits EBNA1 self-synthesis due to a strong purine bias within the GAr. Removal of the GAr (EBNA1ΔGA) leads to increased translation and enhanced MHC class I presentation. In vitro and in vivo translation assays demonstrated that reduction of purine bias within the GAr – (EBNA1 with 400 nucleotides of native GAr sequence, EBNA1-GAr(400N) engineered to EBNA1 with 400 nucleotides of modified GAr sequence, EBNA1-GAr(400M)) dramatically altered the predicted mRNA secondary structure resulting in increased synthesis of EBNA1 and T cell recognition.

inhibit EBNA1 protein synthesis and as a consequence, MHC class I-restricted presentation on the cell surface. Recent investigations have focused on elucidating the molecular basis for this inhibitory effect on EBNA1 synthesis. Tellam et al. have reported the discovery of an unexpected mechanism involving viral mRNAs and their role in enabling EBNA1 to escape the normally very efficient immune surveillance system [36]. Examination of the EBNA1 mRNA sequence demonstrated biased codon usage encoding the GAr sequence (an extreme purine bias at odds with “normal” mammalian codon usage for glycine and alanine), suggesting a novel immune evasion strategy [36,37]. Predicted mRNA secondary structure analysis (MFOLD) showed that substitution of the codon bias of purines with pyrimidines dramatically altered EBNA1 mRNA stability. In vitro and in vivo translation assays using EBNA1 constructs expressing codon-modified sequences, while maintaining the same encoded protein sequence, demonstrated a significantly increased efficiency and amount of EBNA1 synthesis as the purine bias of the GAr was reduced (Fig. 3B). This resulted in a notable enhancement of MHC-peptide complexes detected on the surface of EBNA1 expressing cells, suggesting that the GAr mRNA sequence plays a major role in limiting the amount of EBNA1 antigen produced by virus-infected cells, via inhibition of the rate of translation of the EBNA1 mRNA [36]. The data suggest that this effect is most likely at the level of inhibition of elongation rate, due to the unique secondary structure likely to result from the purine biased RNA sequence. However, further research is required to elucidate the specific molecular lesion(s) caused by the purine-rich content of the GAr resulting in reduced translation of the EBNA1 mRNA and whether this occurs primarily at the level of initiation, elongation or termination of EBNA1 synthesis. Another piece of the EBV immune evasion puzzle comes from recent studies carried out by the Sample group [38] who propose autorepression of EBNA1 expression through the inhibition of pre-mRNA processing. Yoshioka et al. demonstrated that EBNA1 acts post- or co-transcriptionally to block processing of primary transcripts and that this autoregulation is likely to contribute to immune evasion by preventing unnecessary new synthesis, which in turn would limit the generation of EBNA1 antigenic epitopes derived from defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) believed to be the primary source of EBNA1 peptides presented through the MHC class I pathway.

Avoidance of immune surveillance for EBV-infected cells is critical to latent infection by the virus. It is clear that EBV has evolved an effective mechanism to allow persistent latent infection by the addition of a unique “masking” glycine–alanine repeat sequence to the EBNA1 protein. The GAr effect on antigenic epitope generation may well represent a more general immune-evasive mechanism as hundreds of eukaryotic viral mRNAs have evolved with a purine bias [37]. This sequence seems to act at both the protein and mRNA levels to ensure that only an “invisible” low level of EBNA1 antigenic peptides are present in each infected cell and presented to
the immune system. Elucidation of the detailed molecular basis by which EBNA1 subverts the normal protein synthesis and antigen presentation processes of the host cell will suggest novel strategies to overcome latent EBV infections. Such future therapies may well include approaches based on specific “antisense” vaccines aimed at the purine-rich GAr RNA sequence, thus increasing the amount of EBNA1 protein in latently infected cells and facilitating immune recognition and subsequent targeting by the immune system.

3. BNLF2a, a powerful inhibitor of TAP-mediated peptide transport

Initiation of the lytic cycle of EBV is accompanied by a marked reduction of MHC class I and MHC class II expression at the cell surface [8,39]. One of the EBV-encoded proteins contributing to downregulation of MHC class I at the cell surface is BNLF2a. This protein is expressed during the lytic phase of EBV infection and blocks TAP-mediated peptide transport, resulting in a diminished peptide supply into the ER lumen [40]. Identification of the EBV-encoded TAP inhibitor was hampered by the lack of homology to other viral TAP inhibitors identified to date (discussed in more detail below). As most viral immune evasion molecules are virus-specific proteins, γ₁ herpesvirus-specific gene products were screened for their ability to interfere with CTL cytotoxicity. This resulted in the identification of BNLF2a as an EBV-encoded protein preventing CTL-mediated cell lysis. Subsequent experiments demonstrated that cells stably expressing BNLF2a have reduced levels of MHC class I at their surface and an almost complete block of TAP-mediated peptide transport into the ER lumen [40].

TAP is a heterodimer composed of two subunits, TAP1 and TAP2. Both subunits are multimembrane-spanning proteins that have a C-terminal domain mediating ATP binding. ATP hydrolysis is required for the translocation of peptides across the ER membrane by TAP [41]. Both peptide and ATP binding to TAP are affected by BNLF2a, resulting in the inability of TAP to transport peptides [40].

Inhibition of TAP-mediated peptide transport is observed for several other members of the herpesvirus family. Although the TAP-inhibiting proteins encoded by these viruses have a similar function, there is no significant homology in structure and mechanism among these proteins. BNLF2a is a small membrane-associated protein that lacks an obvious signal sequence, but carries a hydrophobic C terminus that may serve as a membrane anchor. BNLF2a interferes with both ATP and peptide binding to TAP [40]. In contrast, the human cytomegalovirus-encoded TAP inhibitor, US6, is a type I membrane protein that interferes with ATP binding to TAP, without affecting the binding of peptides to TAP. This blockage of ATP binding is caused by an indirect effect of US6, as the ER luminal domain of US6 is necessary and sufficient for interference with ATP binding to the cytosolic domain of TAP [42–45]. This apparent discrepancy can be explained by the ability of US6 to alter the conformation of the TAP complex, thereby precluding ATP binding and hydrolysis [46]. Another herpesvirus-encoded TAP inhibitor disrupting ATP binding to TAP is expressed by equine herpesvirus-1 and -4, namely UL49.5 [47]. Functional homologues of UL49.5 are found in bovine herpesvirus-1 and pseudorabies virus [47,48]. However, while all TAP-inhibiting UL49.5 proteins arrest TAP in a translocation-incompetent state, interference with ATP binding is only observed for the equine herpesvirus 1 and 4-encoded TAP inhibitors [47]. In contrast, bovine herpesvirus-encoded UL49.5 targets TAP1 and TAP2 for degradation [48]. Another strategy to prevent TAP-mediated peptide transport is used by herpes simplex virus-1 and -2. These viruses encode a cytosolic protein, ICP47, that competes with peptides for the cytosolic peptide binding site of TAP [49–52]. Although BNLF2a shares its ability to interfere with ATP binding with US6

and the equine herpesvirus 1- and 4-encoded UL49.5 proteins, and its ability to prevent peptide binding to TAP with ICP47, these proteins have a completely different sequence and structure.

One feature these different viral TAP inhibitors have in common is their expression during the viral life cycle. BNLF2a [55; our unpublished observations] US6 [43], UL49.5 [53] and ICP47 [54] are expressed (immediate) early in lytic infection. Early expression of the viral TAP inhibitors will aid in their function to prevent CTL recognition of viral peptides presented by MHC class I molecules. As soon as the virus reactivates, antigenic viral peptides will be generated by the destruction of newly synthesized viral proteins by proteasomes [46]. Early blockage of TAP-mediated peptide transport into the ER lumen will prevent loading of viral peptides, derived from early and late proteins, onto MHC class I molecules and their subsequent display at the cell surface.

Homologues of BNLF2a are found in Old World primate γ₁ herpesviruses. These BNLF2a proteins demonstrate between 53 and 63% overall identity with their counterpart in EBV [40]. Like EBV-encoded BNLF2a, the homologues encoded by rhesus, chimpanzee, orang-utan, and gorilla γ₁ herpesviruses downregulate MHC class I expression at the cell surface, which is indicative of TAP-inhibition [40]. Interestingly, the New World primate γ₁ herpesviruses sequenced so far lack a BNLF2a homologue, which suggests that this viral TAP inhibitor was acquired after branching of the Old World and New World primates during evolution [56].

In conclusion, EBV and related Old World γ₁ herpesviruses encode an immune evasion molecule, BNLF2a, that specifically blocks TAP-mediated peptide transport. The resulting downregulation of MHC class I-peptide complexes at the cell surface protects cells harboring replicating EBV against recognition and lysis by EBV-specific CTLs.

4. BILF1, a novel EBV immune evasion molecule

Most recently, the BILF1 gene product was shown to downregulate cell surface expression of MHC class I, but not MHC class II, and abrogate recognition of endogenous antigen by EBV-specific CD8⁺ T cells [57]. Pulse-labeling and immunoprecipitation experiments with BILF1-transduced cells demonstrated that BILF1 associates with MHC class I molecules within 15 min of their biosynthesis. The MHC class I molecules can mature to the Endo H-resistant glycosylated form as normal, but are more rapidly internalized from the cell surface and are degraded in lysosomes [57].

Many other viral gene products have been shown to target MHC class I molecules for degradation. Some, such as the US3, US10, US2 and US11 proteins of HCMV, target MHC molecules before they reach the cell surface, either by interfering with the maturation of MHC class I molecules and their egress from the ER [58–61] or by inducing retrograde transport from the ER to the cytosol with subsequent degradation by proteasomes [62–64]. Other viral proteins, such as the KSHV K3 and K5 proteins [65–67], induce endocytosis and lysosomal degradation of cell surface MHC class I complexes. Likewise, the HIV Nef protein was one of the first viral proteins reported to induce endocytosis and degradation of MHC class I molecules from the cell surface [68]. However, it is now unclear to what extent endocytosis of MHC class I accounts for its downregulation by Nef, and an alternative but non mutually exclusive explanation is that Nef acts predominantly by diverting intracellular MHC class I complexes to endosomes and lysosomes before they can reach the plasma-membrane [69–71]. Whilst the BILF1 protein is structurally unrelated to these other immune evasion proteins, its mechanism of action shares more similarities with HIV-Nef and the KSHV-K3 and -K5 proteins than with the US3, US10, US2 and US11 proteins of HCMV.
BILF1 is a seven transmembrane segment G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) which, like many vGPCRs encoded by herpesviruses, shares structural and functional characteristics with chemokine receptors [72–74]. The role of vGPCRs is thought to be to contribute to efficient lytic replication cycle by reprogramming the host cell through multiple signaling pathways, often in a ligand-independent manner [74]. One of the first demonstrations that vGPCRs might modulate immune-recognition processes was reported by Bodaghi and colleagues who showed that the US28 vGPCR can modify the chemokine environment of infected cells by binding and internalizing MCP-1 (monocyte chemoattractant protein) and RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted) to efficiently sequester these chemokines [75]. Numerous other examples of the immune-modulating potential of vGPCRs have since been reported, but BILF1 is the first vGPCR shown to specifically target MHC class molecules for degradation. This property of BILF1 is, however, shared by its homolog encoded by the Rhesus γ₁-herpesvirus (CeHV15), which has 80% amino acid identity with EBV BILF1 [57]. In contrast, the ORF74 protein of KSHV, which has 15% amino acid sequence identity with EBV BILF1 and is the most closely related human herpesvirus vGPCR, does not affect MHC class I [57].

It is noteworthy that a cellular chemokine receptor, CXCR4, has also been shown to cause downregulation of expression of MHC class I at the cell surface [76]. Mechanistically, this process involves physical association of CXCR4 with the β2-microglobulin component of mature MHC class I complexes, ubiquitination of the MHC class I heavy chain, and endocytosis of MHC complexes into a late endosomal/lysosomal compartment where degradation presumably occurs. Superficially, this process is similar to the effect of BILF1 on MHC class I. However, while the effect of CXCR4 is triggered by binding of its ligand [76], BILF1 signaling functions are ligand-independent [72,73]. Furthermore, a K122A mutation of BILF1 that abolishes its signaling retains the ability to downregulate MHC class I at the cell surface [57]. In addition, CXCR4 was shown to complex with MHC class I through binding to the β₂-microglobulin subunit [76] whereas BILF1 is unable to bind β₂-microglobulin itself [57]. Finally, activation of CXCR4 was shown to initiate ubiquitination of MHC class I heavy chain molecules [76], whereas there is no evidence that BILF1 acts through ubiquitination of MHC class 1 [57]. Nevertheless, it is interesting that when co-expressed in the same cell, BILF1 and CXCR4 show almost complete co-localization and are both predominantly located in the plasma-membrane, whereas the KSHV-ORF74 and HCMV US28 vGPCRs exhibit mainly intracellular localization [73].

While there remain unanswered questions about the precise mechanisms used by BILF1 to target MHC class I complexes for degradation, the evidence to date clearly points to a role for this viral protein in protecting lytically infected cells from CD8⁺ T cell responses. It is interesting that the immune-evasive properties of BILF1 are genetically separable from its previously identified signaling function [57]. Taken together with the genetically separable exonuclease and immune evasion-related host shut-off functions of BGLF5 [77], this raises the question of whether EBV has evolved a strategy of utilizing multifunctional proteins to evade immune responses.

### 5. BGLF5: the viral DNase, carries a host-shutoff function

The BGLF5 gene product was originally identified as an alkaline exonuclease (DNase) enzyme [78], which is highly conserved amongst all herpesviruses [79–81]. Subsequently, it was shown, first for the KSHV ORF37 [82,83] and then for EBV BGLF5 [77,80], that the exonuclease proteins of γ-herpesviruses possess an additional and genetically separable function which inhibits cellular protein synthesis. The inhibition of *de novo* protein synthesis by BGLF5 (and KSHV ORF37) leads to a loss of MHC class I molecules from the cell surface [80], and a marked impairment of recognition of endogenously processed antigen by EBV-specific CD8⁺ T cells [77]. Mutational analysis of BGLF5 showed that the impairment of immune recognition correlated with host-shutoff function and not with alkaline exonuclease function [77,80]. A similar loss of MHC class II from the cell surface is also observed following expression of BGLF5, and it is likely that immune recognition by CD4⁺ T cells are similarly impaired.

In model experiments involving transient transfection of 293 epithelial cells or MelJuSo melanoma cells, >90% inhibition of recognition by EBV-specific T cell was observed following expression of BGLF5 [77]. This is remarkably efficient considering that the levels of MHC class I were reduced by less than 75% and the amount of EBV target protein was reduced by only 50%. However, the steady-state level of intact target protein may not be the critical factor determining the availability of antigenic peptides for presentation via MHC class I. Rather, if one accepts the hypothesis that peptides presented by MHC class I molecules arise mainly from proteasomal degradation of defective ribosomal products [84], then it is the rate of *de novo* synthesis that will predominantly determine the amount of target peptide available for binding to MHC class I molecules. In the experimental model studied, *de novo* protein synthesis was inhibited by >95% [77,80]. It is also worth noting that the effect of BGLF5 on antigen presentation and T cell recognition is dose-dependent, and that the amount of BGLF5 expressed during lytic cycle in B cells may be sub-optimal. Nevertheless, during lytic cycle in B cells, protein synthesis is inhibited by >95%. Furthermore, BGLF5 does not work in isolation but instead it can cooperate with other immune evasion proteins to enhance the ability of EBV to escape T cell responses.

In α-herpesviruses, the virion host shutoff (vhs) function is mediated by a separate gene, UL41 [85,86] which can also interfere with recognition by CD8⁺ T cells [87]. UL41 mediates protein synthesis shutoff by initiating degradation of RNA transcripts [85,88,89]. Inhibition of protein synthesis by BGLF5 is likewise achieved by an overall increase of mRNA turnover [80], similarly to KSHV ORF37 [82,90], although there is no evidence that BGLF5 or KSHV ORF37 have intrinsic RNase enzyme activities. The precise mechanism of host shutoff by γ-herpesviruses therefore remains to be determined. Furthermore, the nature of the supposed host-specific shutoff is unclear. It is possible that BGLF5 is actually not host-mRNA specific, but that the burst of synthesis of new viral mRNAs during lytic cycle is simply substantially higher than the steady-state synthesis of cellular mRNAs. In addition, the EB2 protein encoded by EBV BMLF1 might work in concert with BGLF5 to selectively promote the cytosolic accumulation of intronless viral mRNAs and inhibit the expression of cellular intron-containing mRNAs [91–93].

BGLF5 protein is expressed with early antigen kinetics, being first detected at around 3–6 h after lytic cycle induction, and independently of phosphonoacetic acid treatment [77]. Both BNLF2a and BGLF5 transcripts peak at around 8–24 h after induction of lytic cycle and decline thereafter [55]. This late decline in BNLF2a and BGLF5 transcripts might be due to expression of BGLF5 itself since the shutoff function appears to affect its own mRNA as well as other viral and cellular RNAs [77]. It is likely that an equilibrium is established between BGLF5 protein turnover and mRNA synthesis so that a constant low level of BGLF5 protein is established that does not completely inhibit viral mRNA expression. In this way, BGLF5 can contribute to immune evasion through late lytic cycle.

6. EBV interference with cytokine-mediated intercellular communication

Cytokine-mediated intercellular communication represents a fundamental component of the host immune response through which antiviral immunity can be coordinated. Viruses can subvert this part of the immune response at several levels, interfering with the intracellular signaling pathways responsible for inducing cytokine expression, producing soluble decoy receptors to bind host cytokines, and secreting cytokine homologs, or “virokines” to mimic the immunosuppressive action of certain host proteins. As an example of the latter strategy, EBV encodes an IL-10 homolog (vIL-10), the product of the lytic phase BCRF-1 gene [94]. Human IL-10 is a pleiotropic cytokine, which appears to exert both immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive actions depending on the target cell and local cytokine microenvironment at a given stage of the immune response [95]. Despite a high degree of conservation, with 84% identity at the amino acid level, vIL-10 displays only a subset of the effects of the human cytokine, showing a substantially reduced ability to enhance mouse thymocyte and mast cell proliferation, while retaining certain immunosuppressive functions [96]. Treatment of primary B lymphocytes with recombinant vIL-10 has been shown to cause a decrease in TAP1 mRNA and protein levels [97]. Furthermore, vIL-10 causes a reduction in mRNA levels of b1i/LMP2, a subunit of the immunoproteasome that shares a bidirectional promoter with the TAP1 gene. This deficit in levels of antigen processing pathway components leads to a reduction in the capacity of B cells to translocate peptides into the ER and a downregulation of MHC class I surface expression.

EBV can also infect and replicate in monocytes and macrophages [98,99]. vIL-10 can inhibit the activation of antigen-specific CD4⁺ T cells when antigens are presented by monocytes [100]. This arises partly from the ability of vIL-10 to inhibit both basal levels and IFN-γ-induced upregulation of MHC class II molecule expression on monocytes [101]. Such a function is shared by human IL-10, which prevents newly synthesized mature MHC class II molecules from traveling to the cell surface, and also impedes their recycling after internalization [102]. vIL-10 can further reduce the capacity of monocytes to stimulate T cells by inhibiting basal and IFN-γ-induced expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and the co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86, which are required to induce T cell IL-2 production and proliferation [101]. Inhibition of IFN-γ-induced MHC class I expression can also be achieved if monocytes are treated with vIL-10 prior to IFN-γ, suggesting that the virokine can inhibit monocyte/macrophage-directed CD8⁺ T cell activation. Aside from inhibiting the ability of monocytes to induce T cell activation, vIL-10 can also attenuate monocyte/macrophage production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α, IL-1β, TNFα, and IL-6 [103]. In this way, it can hinder the ability of uninfected monocytes/macrophages to contribute to the inflammatory response during the productive phase of EBV infection.

The molecular basis for the retention of the immunosuppressive, but not immunostimulatory, functions of hL-10 by the EBV homolog lies in a single amino acid difference at position 87 of the human protein [104]. Altering the isoleucine at this position to an alanine, as possessed by vIL-10, markedly reduces the ability of the cytokine to stimulate thymocyte and mast cell proliferation, without modifying its immunosuppressive activities. Conversely, replacing the corresponding alanine from vIL-10 with an isoleucine provides the recombinant with immunostimulatory properties. vIL-10 binds to the IL-10 receptor complex with approximately 1000-fold less affinity than hIL-10, though this does not necessarily correlate with the specific activity of the protein. Thus, it appears that amino acid position 87 is involved in a key interaction with the IL-10 receptor complex, with the identity of that amino acid dictating the nature of the downstream biological responses.

In addition to expressing an IL-10 homolog, EBV can induce the expression of hIL-10 through LMP1 and through the action of EBERs, small non-polyadenylated, non-coding viral dsRNA molecules [105,106]. Recently, it has been shown that the cytosolic pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) RIG-I and its downstream effector, IRF-3 are required for EBER-mediated IL-10 production [7]. hIL-10 produced during latency can function as an autocrine growth factor for Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL). Furthermore, the production of hIL-10, with its combined immunostimulatory and immunosuppressive properties may play a role in controlling the delicate balance between immune escape and T cell and natural killer cell-mediated immune surveillance that underpins the latent stage of infection. When cells enter the lytic phase of the viral life cycle, production of vIL-10, with its exclusively immunosuppressive functions, could then extend the window of time available for production of new virions.

The observation that vIL-10 can inhibit IFN-γ-mediated stimulation of T cell activity, coupled with the fact that it can hamper IFN-γ production [107] implies that a primary function of vIL-10 is to combat the actions of IFN-γ expressed in response to EBV infection. Indeed, EBV dedicates other immunoevasive mechanisms to the same cause. The product of the immediate early gene BZLF1 is a transcription factor responsible for launching the lytic phase of the viral life cycle. It can also inhibit IFN-γ signaling by reducing mRNA levels of the IFN-γ receptor α chain [108]. The ensuing inhibition of IFN-γ signal transduction manifests as decreased *Jak1, Jak2 and STAT1 tyrosine phosphorylation, and a reduction in downstream IRF1 and CIITA gene induction. As the latter is a key regulator of MHC class II gene expression, BZLF1 also blocks IFN-γ-induced surface expression of MHC class II molecules. BZLF1 can further subvert the host immune response in a variety of ways, including an inhibition of LMP-1-induced upregulation of MHC class I expression [39]. Interestingly, it can also bind to the hIL-10 promoter to induce transcription of the human cytokine [109]. Finally, it interacts with and inhibits the transactivating ability of IRF-7 and the NFκB subunit p65, two central players in the innate immune response to viral infection [110–112].

NFκB and IRFs are activated in response to signaling by a wide range of virus-detecting PRRs. Type I interferons, chemokines, immunologically relevant cell adhesion molecules, and cytokines of a pro-inflammatory and Th1 T cell-polarizing nature are counted amongst their target genes. Attenuating the activity of such central players in the innate antiviral immune response could provide a clear advantage to EBV. Interference with components of the innate immune response has also been demonstrated for EBERs, which can bind to and inhibit the function of dsRNA-activated protein kinase R, thereby blocking IFNα-mediated apoptosis of BL cells [113]. In addition, exposure of B cells to UV-inactivated EBV increases TLR7 expression, appropriating the pro-proliferative effects of TLR7 signaling to induce B-cell growth, while simultaneously altering the profile of activated IRFs to eliminate the antiviral outcome of TLR7 signaling [114].

EBV therefore adopts a multi-faceted approach to disrupting the host cytokine network in an attempt to thwart the antiviral actions of the innate immune response and the stimulation and function of adaptive immune mechanisms.

7. BZLF2/gp42 uses a Trojan horse strategy to block detection by CD4⁺ T cells

Compared to the information currently available on viral inhibitors of MHC class I antigen presentation, much less is known about interference with MHC class II-restricted immune responses.
In view of the importance of MHC class II-restricted T cells, viruses are anticipated to also corrupt this part of the immune system. Indeed, the first examples of MHC class II immunoevasins have been described, a.o. those encoded by human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and HIV [115–120].

During productive EBV infection of B cells, surface expression of MHC class II is downregulated [8,39]. This observation supports the concept that EBV, using MHC class II⁺ B cells as a reservoir, also dedicates specific gene products to interference with detection by MHC class II-restricted antiviral T cells. Host shutoff could contribute to this phenotype through blocking *de novo* synthesis of components essential in the route to antigen presentation by MHC class II molecules. As described earlier, expression of BGLF5 occurs in lytically infected AKBM cells that lose MHC class II alpha and beta chain synthesis as well as surface MHC class II expression [80]. Besides host shutoff, additional, more specific mechanism(s) of MHC class II evasion are likely to be exerted by EBV lytic-cycle gene products.

Strikingly, MHC class II molecules serve as co-receptors for EBV infection of B cells [121–124]: viral entry is mediated by binding of the EBV envelope protein gp42 to MHC class II. This interaction contributes to the B-cell tropism of EBV, illustrating the refined adaptation of the virus to infection of B lymphocytes, mediated by envelope glycoproteins binding to cellular receptors with restricted distribution. Attachment of EBV particles to B cells occurs through the main envelope protein, gp350/220, binding to complement receptor type 2 (CD21) [125,126]. Subsequent fusion events critical to EBV entry of B cells involve gB [127,128] as well as gH/gL/gp42 complexes, in which gp42 binds to MHC class II molecules on the B cell [124,129]. Apart from B cells, EBV infects cells of epithelial origin. The gp42 protein appears to be a molecular switch for this cellular tropism. Whereas the presence of gp42 in the viral envelope is essential to the infection of B lymphocytes, virions that predominantly carry gH/gL dimers (gp42-low) are better suited for infection of (class II-negative) epithelial cells [121]. EBV shed in saliva is highly B-cell tropic (gp42-high) [130]. Interestingly, this cellular tropism of EBV is reflected by its association with malignancies that originate from lymphoid cells (e.g. Burkitt’s lymphoma, Hodgkin’s lymphoma) and epithelial cells (e.g. nasopharyngeal carcinoma).

A special case of gp42/gHgL complexes influencing EBV tropism concerns viral entry into the dendritic cell (DC). DC play a critical role in the induction of primary antiviral T-cell responses and in the case of EBV this was substantiated by earlier observations of monocyte-derived DC efficiently crosspresenting EBV antigens from apoptotic or necrotic EBV-transformed B cells to activate specific T cells [131]. However, EBV appears to have evolved countermeasures to corrupt efficient T-cell induction by inhibiting the development of monocytes into DC. Addition of EBV particles to monocyte precursors at early stages of DC differentiation (in the presence of GM-CSF and IL4) rendered the cells susceptible to virus-induced apoptosis. As a result, the numbers of DC recovered were drastically reduced, although their functionality was not affected by co-culture with EBV [132]. The pro-apoptotic activity of EBV on monocytes was independent of *de novo* viral gene expression, since it was also induced by UV-inactivated virions. Rather, interactions of the trimolecular gp42/gHgL complex in the viral envelope with the monocyte membrane appeared essential for inhibition of DC development. In subsequent studies, EBV virions containing different ratios of the gp42 and gH glycoproteins in their envelopes were derived from MHC class II⁺ B cells or class II⁻ epithelial cells. EBV virions produced in B cells (gp42-low) did not induce apoptosis nor did they enter monocytes. In contrast, epithelial cell-derived EBV (gp42-high) entered monocytes and inhibited their development into DC [133]. Entry of

(recombinant) EBV particles into monocytes was demonstrated by detection of GFP expression. It remains to be established whether these monocyte-derived DC were truly infected with EBV, since viral gene expression was not detectable. Taken together, EBV appears to exploit a new strategy for interference with the function of DC during the initiation and maintenance of virus-specific immune responses: during EBV entry or shortly thereafter, virion components inhibit development of monocytes into DC in the presence of GM-CSF and IL4. Furthermore, a decrease in gp42 content in the viral envelope increases the efficiency of this inhibition.

To investigate whether expression of EBV gp42 in cells – as occurring during productive infection – results in interference with MHC class II-restricted T-cell activation, an MHC class II⁺ cell line stably expressing gp42 (MJS/gp42 cells) was generated through retroviral transduction. The cells were found to express EBV gp42 at the cell surface. Moreover, MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation to T-helper cells was hampered by the expression of gp42 [134]. This interference with T-cell activation involved association of gp42 with class II peptide complexes. Using HLA-DR tetramers, a block in T cell receptor (TCR)-class II interactions imposed by gp42 was identified as the underlying mechanism. EBV gp42 sterically clashes with TCR Valpha-domains as visualized by superimposing the crystal structures of gp42–HLA-DR1 and TCR–MHC class II complexes [134].

Further analysis of the biosynthesis and maturation of gp42 in MJS/gp42 cells revealed that gp42 occurs in two forms: a full-length type II membrane protein and a truncated soluble form. The soluble form, s-gp42, is generated by proteolytic cleavage in the ER and is secreted [135]. Both forms are capable of associating with MHC class II molecules intracellularly. In addition, both the transmembrane and a soluble form of gp42 were observed in lytically infected EBV⁺ B cells, indicating that s-gp42 is generated during productive EBV infection [135]. It is tempting to speculate that the soluble form of gp42 could also act *in trans*, shielding neighboring cells from CD4⁺ T-cell attack. Still, the contribution of either form of gp42 to MHC class II immune evasion during natural EBV infection is unclear at present.

Cumulative data thus show that gp42 functions as an immunoevasin specific for MHC class II-restricted antigen presentation *in vitro*. Yet, cellular expression of gp42 alone did not induce downregulation of surface MHC class II [134] and can, therefore, not account for the reduced MHC class II levels observed at the surface of productively EBV-infected B cells [8]. Since gp42 occurs in the EBV envelope in a complex with gH and gL, one could hypothesize that these interaction partners might play an additional role. Preliminary data show a marked reduction of mature MHC class II complexes detected at the surface of cells stably expressing gH and gL, in addition to gp42 (our unpublished results). Ongoing experiments aim at identifying the mechanism exerted by the trimolecular cluster gp42/gHgL to affect MHC class II surface display, as well as determining its contribution to the MHC class II downregulation observed on B cells supporting EBV lytic cycle.

In summary, cellular expression of EBV gp42 interferes with CD4⁺ T-cell recognition in an unprecedented fashion: gp42 sterically blocks the interaction of T-cell receptors with MHC class II/peptide complexes. This mechanism of viral immune evasion is different from those exerted by two HCMV gene products: US2, which targets MHC class II molecules for degradation by proteasomes [118], and US3, which prevents peptide-loading of class II complexes through inefficient intracellular sorting [115]. Yet another strategy is employed by HIV-1 Nef to inhibit MHC class II-restricted peptide presentation to specific T cells. Expression of Nef reduces the surface level of mature (i.e. peptide-loaded) MHC class II, while increasing levels of immature MHC class II, which
are functionality incompetent because of their association with the invariant chain [116]. The latter probably results from reduced internalization of invariant chains from the cell surface via impairment of AP-2-dependent endocytosis [117,119]. Thus, analogous to viral interference with MHC class I-restricted antigen presentation, different viruses appear to have acquired unrelated immune evasion molecules to thwart CD4⁺ T-cell detection through various mechanisms.

### 8. Concluding remarks

Modulation of T-cell recognition is of crucial importance for EBV, as this herpesvirus resides intracellularly for most of its life cycle and, following primary infection, abundant virus-specific memory T cells are induced that will immediately respond to viral reactivation. In this review, we have shown that EBV encodes an array of unique immune evasion molecules that cooperatively prevent detection of cells harboring latent and lytic EBV infection. During the latent phase, this is exemplified by EBNA1, but also LMP1 [141], and the EBERs [7]. A novel class of molecules that may promote survival of cells harboring EBV infection is formed by virus-encoded micro-RNAs (miRs) [136–138]. Recent studies indicate that miRs encoded within the EBV BHRF1 region possess immunomodulatory capacities [139], whereas a miR encoded within the BALF region exerts anti-apoptotic activity [140].

Also during the lytic phase of EBV infection, multiple evasion strategies are operational that function in a concerted action. Immediately after initiation of the lytic cycle, BNLF2a is produced. This gene product shuts down TAP-mediated import of antigenic peptides into the ER, thereby preventing peptide-loading of MHC class I molecules. This will not only affect newly synthesized MHC class I molecules, but also the large pool of pre-existing MHC class I complexes present within the ER, thus serving as a first line of defense in the ER. Shortly after that, BGLF5 comes into play. Inhibition of cellular protein synthesis by BGLF5 ensures a block in supply of new MHC class I molecules, thereby acting synergistically with BNLF2a. An EBV-encoded IL-10 homolog further compromises antigen presentation via the class I pathway by blocking the synthesis of TAP1 and the immunoproteasome subunit b1i/LMP2. MHC class I complexes that have reached the cell surface are down-modulated by BILF1. EBV also affects antiviral activity of the host immune system through more general mechanisms, including interference with the action of the important antiviral cytokine IFN-γ. Thus, various steps in the MHC class I antigen presentation pathway appear targeted by viral gene products, ensuring effective interference with the presentation of virus-encoded antigens by MHC class I molecules at the cell surface.

CD4⁺ T cell activation is subverted by EBV through the obstruction of MHC class II/peptide-TCR interactions via the BZLF2 product gp42. Host shutoff by BGLF5 and vIL-10 also affects MHC class II expression. At the surface of EBV⁺ B cells in lytic cycle, levels of MHC class II molecules are downregulated through additional, yet unknown mechanism(s).

In conclusion, multiple EBV gene products act in concert to block antigen presentation via MHC class I and class II molecules, thereby preventing the detection of cells harboring latent and replicating EBV by CD8⁺ and CD4⁺ T lymphocytes. These immune-evasive maneuvers are combined with other mechanisms preventing the induction of programmed cell death. Thus, the survival of latently and lytically EBV-infected cells involves a synergistic interplay of multiple viral gene products that is of great complexity. A profound understanding of these processes is essential for successful development of drugs and vaccines against EBV, an oncogenic herpesvirus.
