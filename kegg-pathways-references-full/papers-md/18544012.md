The human complement system plays an important role in the control of *Staphylococcus aureus* infection. For instance, we previously demonstrated that the central complement component deposited on the organism’s surface, C3b, can be cleaved by the host complement control protein, factor I, resulting in diminished phagocytosis of *S. aureus*. In the present study, we have identified clumping factor A (ClfA) from cell wall proteins of *S. aureus* as a specific protein bound by factor I. Recombinant ClfA (rClfA) containing the full-length A region (peptides 40–559) also bound factor I. We identified an ~50-kDa fragment of ClfA that is shed by *S. aureus* into growth medium. The shed ClfA fragment was derived from the A region of ClfA and bound factor I. rClfA and the shed ClfA fragment increased factor I cleavage of C3b into inactive C3b. Our findings describe a new *S. aureus* mechanism for modification of host complement activities.

*Staphylococcus aureus* is a highly successful pathogen, a common cause of community-associated infection, and the most common cause of severe nosocomial infection [1–3]. *S. aureus* infections cause considerable morbidity, mortality, and medical expense [4, 5]. Antibiotic resistance continues to increase for *S. aureus* isolates, and the rapid worldwide spread of community-associated methicillin-resistant *S. aureus* infection is particularly disconcerting [6–8]. New approaches to prevent and treat *S. aureus* infection are needed, and immune-directed strategies appear to have great potential for the development of novel therapeutics against this pathogen.

Evasion of host defenses is necessary for pathogens to replicate, establish infection, and produce disease. Complement-mediated opsonization is a critical host defense against many pathogenic bacteria, and C3, the central complement component, plays an important role in host defense against *S. aureus* infection in humans and animal models [9, 10]. Activation of complement pathways leads to the conversion of C3 to C3b, which binds to *S. aureus* as a highly potent opsonin [11, 12]. In vitro and in vivo data suggest that surface-bound C3b is important for immunologic control of *S. aureus* [13, 14]. We have shown elsewhere that much of the C3b bound to the surface of *S. aureus* is rapidly cleaved into inactive C3b (iC3b) and that this cleavage is mediated by complement regulatory protein factor I [15]. Known properties of C3b cleavage into iC3b include diminishment of binding to complement receptor 1 (CD35) on phagocytes, prevention of activation of the alternative complement pathway, and prevention of activation of the terminal complement cascade [16]. Binding to CD11b/18 (CR1) is increased for iC3b [17]. We have shown previously that factor I cleavage of *S. aureus*-bound C3b diminished phagocytosis by neutrophils [18]. Taken together, these data suggest that factor I affects immunologic control of *S. aureus* by cleaving C3b.

Complement Factor I and *S. aureus* ClfA • JID 2008:198 (1 July) • 125

Pathogen utilization of host complement-regulatory proteins has been described for several agents [19]. *Streptococcus pyogenes* and *Streptococcus pneumoniae*, which, like *S*. *aureus*, are gram-positive cocci, express surface proteins that bind complement factor H, a cofactor for factor I [20–23]. We hypothesized that *S*. *aureus* may enhance the activity of factor I, specifically by localizing factor I to its surface and providing a staphylococcal cofactor to facilitate efficient cleavage of bound C3b. We have shown elsewhere, using Western blotting and SDS-PAGE, that purified factor I will bind to a well-characterized laboratory strain of *S*. *aureus* [15]. In the present study, we extend our support of this hypothesis by identifying a *S*. *aureus* cell wall component that binds factor I and a shed staphylococcal protein with cofactor activity for factor I.

**METHODS**

**Bacteria.** *S*. *aureus* strain Reynolds or Newman was grown to midlogarithmic phase, as described elsewhere [11]. *S*. *aureus* strain Reynolds in midlogarithmic phase produces undetectable amounts of capsule, as shown by rocket immunoelectrophoresis [11].

**Buffers, serum, and factor I.** Normal human serum (NHS) was diluted in 60% dextrose-gelatin veronal-buffered saline (DGVBS)^{2+}^ buffer [11], unless otherwise stated. NHS was obtained from the blood of healthy human volunteers (Eastern Virginia Medical School Institutional Review Board 02-06-EX-0216) and pooled. Purified factor I was purchased commercially (CompTech) and tested for purity by SDS-PAGE with SYPRO Ruby staining (Invitrogen) [15] and Western blot analysis with anti-factor H antibody detection.

**S. aureus cell wall lysate and supernatant from growth medium.** Midlogarithmic-phase *S*. *aureus* were washed with PBS, and cell wall preparations were generated as described elsewhere [24]. *S*. *aureus* growth medium supernatant was generated from bacterial culture grown overnight via sedimentation and supernatant recovery.

**Recombinant ClfA (rClfA).** rClfA was expressed as a His-tagged protein containing the A region (peptides 40–559) of ClfA in an *Escherichia coli* expression system, as described elsewhere [25].

**Factor I binding to and release from S. aureus.** Washed midlogarithmic-phase *S*. *aureus* (1 × 10^9^ cfu/mL) were incubated with 10% NHS in 60% DGVBS^{2+} buffer for 5 min, unless otherwise noted. Washed bacteria were boiled in 30 μL of 2% SDS (0.5 mol/L Tris) for 5 min to remove surface-bound proteins and then sedimented, and the supernatant was recovered for analysis by factor I ELISA.

*S. aureus* (5 × 10^8^ cfu/mL) were incubated with purified factor I (0–40 μg/mL) in 250 μL, washed, and incubated in 25 μL of PBS for 16 h. Bacteria were sedimented and the supernatants recovered. Sedimented bacteria were boiled in 25 μL of 2% SDS

for 5 min, and supernatants containing surface proteins were recovered. Both samples were analyzed by Western blotting for factor I.

**Factor I ELISA.** Flat-bottom Immulon 2 plates (Thermo Labsystems) were coated with 50 μL (1.0 μg/mL) of monoclonal anti-human factor I antibody (Quidel) in carbonate buffer (overnight at 4°C). Washed wells were blocked with 3% bovine serum albumin (BSA; overnight at 4°C), washed, incubated with samples (1 h at room temperature), and washed again. The primary probe was goat anti-human factor I antibody (1:500 in 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature), and the secondary probe was rabbit anti-goat horseradish peroxidase (HRP) antibody (1:4000 in 3% BSA for 1 h at room temperature), developed with tetramethylbenzidine, stopped with 1N H₂SO₄, and read at 450 nm. Purified factor I was used for standard curves.

**SDS-PAGE and C3 Western blotting.** SDS-PAGE, total protein staining, and Western blotting for C3 fragments were performed as described elsewhere [18].

**Chromatography.** A HiPrep 16/60 Sephacryl column (GE Healthcare) was used for size-exclusion column chromatography. The column was equilibrated with distilled water and then 60% VBS^{2+}; 5.0-mL fractions were collected at a rate of 1.0 mL/min. A 5-mL HiTrap Q HP column (GE Healthcare) was used for ion-exchange column chromatography. The column was equilibrated with 20 mmol/L Tris buffer (pH 8.6), and the sample was loaded and washed. The column was eluted with a salt gradient, using 20 mmol/L Tris and 20 mmol/L Tris plus 1 mol/L NaCl buffers.

**Dot blot detection of factor I binding.** Column fractions (400 μL) were added to dot blot wells and drained through a polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane. The washed membrane was incubated in 20% heat-inactivated human serum/Tris-buffered saline (TBS; overnight at 4°C). The primary probe was goat anti-human factor I (1:4000 in 5% heat-inactivated serum), and the secondary probe was rabbit anti-goat HRP antibody (1:4000 in 5% heat-inactivated serum), developed by enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL). Quantitation was done by optical densitometry (Quantity One; Bio-Rad).

**Western blot detection of factor I and factor I overlay blot.** PVDF was blocked in 3% BSA/TBS-Tween (TBST; overnight at 4°C). The primary probe was anti-factor I monoclonal antibody (1:2000 in 3% BSA), and the secondary probe was goat anti-mouse HRP antibody (1:1000 in 3% BSA), developed by ECL. Purified factor I was used as a control in these assays.

PVDF for factor I overlay blot was incubated in 20% heat-inactivated human serum/TBST (overnight at 4°C). The membrane was probed with anti-factor I monoclonal antibody (1:2000 in 5% heat-inactivated serum) and then with goat anti-mouse HRP antibody (5% heat-inactivated serum) and was developed by ECL.

**Western blot detection of ClfA and rClfA overlay blot.** The PVDF membrane for Western blot detection of ClfA was blocked in

3% BSA/TBST (overnight at 4°C). The primary probe was rabbit anti-ClfA antibody (1:5000 in blocking solution), and the secondary probe was goat anti-rabbit HRP antibody (1:5000 in 3% BSA), developed by ECL. The PVDF membrane for the rClfA overlay blot was blocked with 3% BSA/TBST, and then 60 μg of rClfA was added (overnight at 4°C). The primary probe was rabbit anti-ClfA antibody (1:5000 in 3% BSA), the secondary probe was goat anti-rabbit HRP antibody (1:4000 in 3% BSA), and development was done by ECL.

**Staphylococcal supernatant overlay blot.** One microliter of NHS and 0.01 mg of factor I were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel (nondenaturing) and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The membrane was blocked with 3% BSA/TBS/Tween and then incubated with 75 μL of *S. aureus* growth medium supernatant (overnight at 4°C). The primary probe was rabbit anti-ClfA antibody (1:5000 in 3% BSA), the secondary probe was goat anti-rabbit HRP antibody (1:4000 in 3% BSA), and development was done by ECL.

**Factor I–binding rClfA.** For a modified ELISA, wells of an ELISA plate were coated with rClfA at 1–10 μg/mL in carbonate buffer (overnight at 4°C). Washed wells were blocked with 3% BSA/PBS/Tween, washed again, and incubated with NHS in 3% BSA for 1 h. Washed wells were incubated with 0.1 mL of anti-factor I monoclonal antibody (1:1000 in 3% BSA for 1 h) and then 0.1 mL of anti-mouse HRP antibody (1:500 in 3% BSA for 1 h), washed, and developed as described above. Half-maximal binding was calculated as described elsewhere [26]. Similar to the rClfA-coated microtiter plate assay described below, biotinylated (EZ-Link; Pierce) purified factor I (50 nmol/L) was incubated with increasing amounts of unlabeled purified factor I in the presence of C3b; residual binding was measured using streptavidin-HRP and developed as described above.

**Factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b.** In 100 μL of 60% DGVBS²⁺, purified C3b (1 μg) and purified factor I (1 μg, unless otherwise noted) were combined with concentrated *S. aureus* growth medium supernatant, column fractions, column-purified secreted ClfA (sClfA; ~50-kDa fragment), or rClfA (16 h at 37°C) and then measured for C3b cleavage by iC3b ELISA, as described elsewhere [18]. A C3b plus factor H plus factor I control was used for these experiments. Where noted, microtiter plate wells were coated with rClfA (5 μg) and then incubated with 10 μg of purified C3b and 0.25 μg of purified factor I; supernatants were analyzed by Western blot for C3 fragments.

**Mass spectrometry (MS) identification.** Protein bands were excised from 1-dimensional PAGE gels. Gel slices were cut into 1–2-mm cubes, washed 3 times with 500 μL of ultrapure water, and incubated in 100% acetonitrile for 45 min. Samples were reduced with 50 mmol/L dithiothreitol at 56°C for 45 min and then alkylated with 55 mmol/L iodoacetamide for 1 h at room temperature. The material was dried in a SpeedVac (Savant), rehydrated in 12.5 ng/μL modified sequencing-grade trypsin solution (Promega), and incubated in an ice bath for 40–45 min. The excess trypsin solution was then removed and replaced with 40–50 μL of 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate and 10% acetonitrile (pH 8.0), and the mixture was incubated overnight at 37°C.

Elastase digests were performed as described for trypsin at an enzyme concentration of 15 ng/μL without acetonitrile in the reaction buffer. Peptides were extracted twice with 25 μL of 50% acetonitrile and 5% formic acid and dried in a SpeedVac. Digests were resuspended in 20 μL of buffer A (5% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid), and 3–6 μL was loaded onto a 12-cm by 0.075-mm fused silica capillary column packed with 5-μm-diameter carbon 18 beads (The Nest Group), using a nitrogen pressure vessel at 1100 psi. Peptides were eluted over 55 min by applying a 0%–80% linear gradient of buffer B (95% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid, and 0.005% heptafluorobutyric acid) at a flow rate of 150 μL/min with a precolumn flow splitter, resulting in a final flow rate of ~200 nL/min directly into the source. In some cases, the gradient was extended to 150 min, to acquire more tandem MS (MS/MS) spectra.

An LTQ Linear Ion Trap (ThermoFinnigan) was used in an automated collection mode with an instrument method composed of a single segment and 5 data-dependent scan events with a full MS scan, followed by 4 MS/MS scans of the highest-intensity ions. The normalized collision energy was set at 35 and the activation Q was 0.250, with minimum full-scan signal intensity at 1 × 10⁵ and no minimum MS/MS intensity specified. Dynamic exclusion was turned on, with a 3-min repeat count of 2 and the mass width set at a mass to charge ratio of 1.0. Sequence analysis was performed with Mascot (Matrix Sciences), using an indexed bacterial subset database of the nonredundant protein database from the National Center for Biotechnology Information Web site (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

**Statistical analysis.** Results of independent replicate experiments were averaged, and SEs were calculated. Statistical comparisons were made using Student’s *t* test.

## RESULTS

**Serum factor I binding to S. aureus.** To test the rapidity of factor I binding to *S. aureus*, a time course using midlogarithmic-phase bacteria incubated in 10% serum was analyzed (figure 1A). Maximal factor I binding was observed by 1 min, with no increase in binding observed at subsequent time points. Increased factor I binding to *S. aureus* was observed with increasing serum concentration up to 10% NHS (figure 1B). Persistence of factor I binding to *S. aureus* was tested using bacteria incubated in purified factor I, washed, and then incubated in PBS for 16 h. The amount of factor I released into the buffer was minimal, whereas *S. aureus*-associated factor I signal remained strong in the Western blot analysis (figure 1C).

Figure 1. Serum factor I binding to *Staphylococcus aureus* in normal human serum (NHS), as measured by ELISA, for increasing time in 10% NHS (A) and for increasing serum concentration (B). Panel C shows a Western blot analysis of *S. aureus*-bound factor I shed into surrounding PBS or remaining on the bacterial surface over 16 h. Data are mean ± SE results of ≥3 independent experiments.

### Identification of factor I binding to a cell wall protein.
To identify cell wall components that bind to factor I, *S. aureus* cell wall proteins were prepared using 30% raffinose to stabilize the protoplasts and lysostaphin to digest the cell wall. Cell wall proteins were then fractionated by alternating size-exclusion chromatography on sepharose columns and ion-exchange column chromatography. Fractions were then dot blotted and tested by factor I overlay for factor I binding (figure 2A). Fractions demonstrating maximal binding were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and factor I overlay Western blot identified a band of ~130 kDa. Sizes were estimated using molecular weight markers (MWMs).

onstrating high factor I binding were separated by SDS-PAGE, and a band of ~130 kDa was identified that bound to factor I by overlay Western blot (figure 2B). The band was cut from the gel and digested for MS analysis. Two independent cell wall protein preparations led to MS identification of the ~130-kDa band as ClfA (figure 2C and table 1).

**Factor I interaction with ClfA.** To test the binding of ClfA and factor I, a solubilized cell wall preparation was separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a membrane. The band at ~130

kDa bound to serum factor I by overlay Western blot analysis and was detected with anti-ClfA antibody (figure 3A). A modified ELISA was then performed using rClfA (peptides 40–559) bound to the bottom of the ELISA plate to capture serum factor I, with detection by use of anti-factor I monoclonal antibody (figure 3B). A dose response was noted for increasing amounts of rClfA and increasing amounts of factor I. Half-maximal binding for factor I was observed at 50 nmol/L, where rClfA was coated at 10 $\mu$g/mL. NHS was then analyzed by rClfA overlay Western

BSA, bovine serum albumin.

blotting (figure 3C). rClfA bound to an ~88-kDa band that was consistent with factor I by Western blot analysis. Binding of soluble biotinylated purified factor I to rClfA-coated microtiter plates was inhibited by increasing amounts of soluble unlabeled purified factor I (figure 3D).

Given that ClfA appeared to bind to factor I, it was of interest to determine whether ClfA could act as a “cofactor” for factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b, a phenomenon noted to occur on the surface of *S. aureus* in the absence of a known cofactor for factor I [15]. rClfA (3 μg) was incubated with purified C3b and purified factor I, and the increased iC3b was measured by ELISA (*P* < .05) and compared with control values (figure 3E). C3b incubated with rClfA in the absence of factor I generated no measurable iC3b. rClfA was used to coat microtiter plates and incubated with purified C3b and purified factor I (ratio, 40:1). C3 fragments were analyzed by Western blot (figure 3F). Optical densitometry measurements, normalized for the β-chain, showed that rClfA plus factor I decreased C3b (α'-chain) by 60% and increased iC3b (α'₂-chain) by 287%, compared with control values. These findings suggest that human factor I binds to the *S. aureus* surface protein ClfA and can increase factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b.

**Identification of a shed protein with cofactor activity for factor I.** To test whether shed or secreted staphylococcal components could act as a cofactor for factor I, *S. aureus* growth medium supernatants were prepared from overnight growth in liquid medium to recover secreted and shed proteins. The growth medium supernatant was incubated with purified factor I and purified C3b and was found to increase factor I cleavage of C3b into iC3b, as detected by ELISA (figure 4A). A dose response was noted for increasing amounts of supernatant used. Staphylococcal growth medium incubated with purified C3b without factor I did not result in iC3b generation (data not shown). Generation of iC3b was also tested for growth medium supernatants at different ratios of C3b to factor I, including 40:1, the ratio in serum (figure 4C). Growth medium supernatants were then fractionated by alternating size-exclusion column chromatography and ion-exchange column chromatography. Fractions were incubated with purified C3b and purified factor I to detect iC3b generation or cofactor activity for factor I (figure 4B). Fractions with cofactor activity were consistently found to contain a 50–55-kDa band that could be highly purified, as determined by SDS-PAGE with total protein staining (figure 4D). From this fraction, peptides from the A region of ClfA were identified by MS (figure 4E and table 2). This suggests that an ~50-kDa fragment containing part of the A region of ClfA is shed from the *S. aureus* surface into the surrounding environment.

pernatant, and anti-ClfA antibody also detected an ~50-kDa band (figure 5A). NHS and purified factor I were separated by SDS-PAGE, blotted to a membrane, and probed with staphylococcal growth medium supernatant and then anti-ClfA antibody (figure 5B). An ~88-kDa band was detected for both conditions, consistent with factor I. These findings suggest that S. aureus sheds a fragment of ClfA (sClfA) that binds to factor I.

sClfA purified by column chromatography of growth medium supernatants was incubated with purified C3b and purified factor I, resulting in C3b cleavage into iC3b, as determined by ELISA (figure 5C). sClfA (2 μg) increased factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b 9-fold, compared with control values ($P < .01$). The sClfA cofactor activity for factor I increased in a dose-dependent manner (data not shown). sClfA alone did not cleave C3b (data not shown). These samples were then subjected to Western blot analysis to identify all C3 fragments present (figure 5D). The 42-kDa fragment of iC3b was clearly increased for sClfA, compared with control values. These samples were also analyzed by SDS-PAGE to quantify cleavage of the $\alpha'$-chain of C3b (figure 5E). Optical densitometric measurements of the $\alpha'$-chain, normalized for the $\beta$-chain, showed a 38% decrease in C3b for sClfA, compared with control values. These findings

suggest that an ~50-kDa fragment of ClfA is shed from S. aureus, binds to factor I, and increases factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b. Factor I binding to the S. aureus surface was also tested in the presence of overnight growth medium supernatant containing sClfA, which showed diminished factor I binding (P < .03) to the bacterium (figure 5F).

# DISCUSSION

ClfA is a 933-aa, cell wall, surface-expressed protein that is composed of a distal A region (peptides 40–559) and a proximal SD–repeat R region, relative to the cell wall [27]. The A region binds to fibrinogen and contributes to the ability of S. aureus to clump when incubated in serum [28]. Interestingly, ClfA has been shown to contribute to platelet aggregation by a fibrinogen-mediated as well as a complement-mediated mechanism [29]. Also of interest is the observation that ClfA has been found to have an antiphagocytic effect, only part of which can be attributed to interaction with fibrinogen [30].

We believe that this is the first description of a fragment of ClfA being shed from S. aureus. The full-length ClfA is attached to the cell wall by the LPXTG motif and is ~130 kDa by SDS-PAGE [27]. The fragment of sClfA present in staphylococcal growth medium supernatant appears to be ~50 kDa. The peptide sequences identified by MS are all present in the A region. sClfA appears to bind to factor I, similar to both the full-length ClfA and rClfA (peptides 40–559). rClfA contains the entire A region of ClfA (~80 kDa), thus encompassing much, if not all, of the sClfA fragment. These findings suggest that factor I binds in the A region of the molecule and that this binding domain is also present in the sClfA fragment.

We believe that this is the first description of a bacterial protein that binds to factor I and has cofactor activity for factor I, enhancing cleavage of C3b into iC3b. Pox and herpes family viruses express viral cofactors for factor I, suggesting that enhancing factor I activity is important in the pathogenesis of the disease produced by these viruses in humans [31–34]. We have shown elsewhere that factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b on the surface of S. aureus results in diminished efficiency of phagocytosis [18], Thus, it is plausible that the ability of ClfA to localize factor I to the S. aureus surface and increase factor I–mediated cleavage of C3b into iC3b contributes to immune evasion and pathogenesis.

S. aureus appears to employ multiple strategies that modify complement activities, such as that of capsule, which has antiopsonophagocytic activities for solid medium–grown organisms [11, 13]. Chemotaxis inhibitory protein of S. aureus (CHIPS), a secreted protein, inhibits C5a-mediated chemotaxis by phagocytes [35]. Extracellular fibrinogen-binding (Efb) protein is a secreted protein reported to inhibit C3 activation [36, 37]. Staphylococcal complement inhibitor (SCIN) is a secreted S. aureus protein that adversely affects C3 convertases [38, 39].

The interaction between ClfA and factor I appears to be a new mechanism whereby S. aureus modifies complement activity.
