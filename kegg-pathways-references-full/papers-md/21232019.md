## Introduction

Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-$\alpha$) was discovered ~30 years ago as a product of immune activation. In the last three decades, an impressive amount of knowledge has been obtained regarding the biological functions of TNF, as well as the signaling mechanisms engaged by its receptors. TNF primarily occurs as a type II transmembrane protein of 26 kDa, which can be cleaved by the metalloprotease TNF-$\alpha$-converting enzyme to a 17 kDa TNF protein that is biologically active in a soluble homo-trimeric molecule of 51 kDa [1,2].

TNF exerts a broad range of biological effects via two known transmembrane receptors that were discovered ~30 years ago [3]: the 55 kDa TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), which is expressed ubiquitously on almost all cell types; and the larger 75 kDa TNF receptor 2 (TNFR2), which under normal physiological conditions is expressed typically at low levels in cells of the immune system [4–8]. TNFR1 serves as the major mediator of TNF-induced signaling pathways. TNFR1 signaling has pleiotropic functions such as activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-$\kappa$B) and induction of apoptosis, both of which depend on the cellular environment. The expression of TNFR2, however, is much more limited to specific cell types compared with

TNFR1. TNFR2 expression is restricted to specific neuronal subtypes, and to oligodendrocytes, microglia and astrocytes in the brain, to endothelial cells, and certain T-cell subpopulations, including lymphocytes (CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells), cardiac myocytes, thymocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells [9,10]. A large body of research has shown that TNF possesses the capacity for a great number of highly different biological functions via its two receptors. Some aspects regarding cross-talk between TNF receptors and signaling cascades have been discussed in previous review articles [11–13].

### TNF signaling in immunity

The significant role of TNFR1 in immunity has been shown in several studies *in vivo*. Flynn, *et al.* [14] showed that TNFR1 is essential to protect mice against tuberculosis infection, reactive nitrogen production by macrophages and also proper granuloma functioning. TNFR1- and TNF-deficient mice die from a fulminant necrotizing encephalitis when orally infected with a low-virulent strain of *Toxoplasma gondii*, whereas TNFR2-deficient mice were unaffected [15]. Furthermore, it has been shown that TNFR1 is the TNF receptor primarily responsible for initiating inflammatory responses [16,17]. Kim *et al.* [18] published evidence that CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells depend on TNFR2 for survival during clonal expansion in response to intracellular bacterial pathogens, thus allowing larger accumulation of effector cells and thereby optimizing protection from apoptosis by inducing a substantial generation of the antigen-specific memory T-cell population. In an another study, it was found that TNFR2- and TNF-knockout mice have delayed clearance of hepatic replication-deficient adenovirus and also decreased adenovirus-specific cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activity of intrahepatic lymphocytes. TNFR1 knockout mice did not display such effects, allowing the conclusion that TNFR2 facilitates the generation of antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes for antiviral immune responses [19]. Also, TNFR2 knockout mice had no CD8⁺ T-cell-mediated lung injury associated with clearance of experimental influenza virus, indicating that TNFR2 is important for the occurrence of immunopathology in alveolar tissue [20]. However, in another study, it was shown that TNFR2 activation by insulin selectively killed autoreactive T cells derived from the blood of type 1 diabetes patients, which did not have an effect on other activated and memory T-cell populations [21]. In summary, TNFR2 can play a vital role in the maintenance of the delicate and complex processes involved in immune system functioning.

### TNF receptor cross-talk

#### TNF signaling in cellular survival

TNF in the nervous system exerts opposing effects via TNFR1 and TNFR2 with respect to cell survival in neuronal tissue exposed to traumatic insults (for further details see Van Herreweghe *et al.* regarding TNFR1-mediated cell death and survival signaling mechanisms [22]). In a retinal ischemia mouse model, both TNFR1 and TNFR2 were upregulated in neural retinal cell layers a few hours after ischemia-reperfusion-induced retinal damage. Interestingly, TNFR1 aggravated neuronal death, whereas TNFR2 protected against ischemic tissue destruction [23]. TNFR2 is also necessary for TNF-α-induced regeneration of myelin-forming oligodendrocyte precursor cells [24]. Specific stimulation of TNFR1 in baboons caused local skin necrosis, whereas TNFR2-specific stimulation had no effect on skin necrosis [25]. Furthermore, in a large human clinical trial it became clear that a TNF-neutralizing antibody exacerbated symptoms when administered to patients with multiple sclerosis [26,27]. It has also been shown in an *in vivo* heart failure model in mice that TNFR1 has damaging effects on chamber remodeling, systolic dysfunction and hypertrophy, whereas TNFR2 proved to be cardioprotective in this regard [28]. Although most of our knowledge with respect to TNF signaling has been obtained in models using TNFR1- and TNFR2 knockout mouse models, as well as agonistic antibodies specifically stimulating either one of the receptors, the coexistence and costimulation of both receptors in an unaltered biological system should be taken into consideration. It is possible that genetic modification to the animals might have an influence on many different aspects of TNF signaling. Deletion of the TNF might lead to alterations in the balance of intricate signaling cascades, epigenetic modifications and decreased soluble TNF receptors, which also function as TNF inhibitors. Recently, research has shown that cross-talk between TNFR1 and TNFR2 may take place which is controlled or influenced by many factors, including cell type, intracellular or extracellular environment, age, response to injury, inflammation and the occurrence of NF-κB activation [10].

#### TNFR1 signaling pathway

TNFR1 is activated via both membrane-bound and soluble TNF [29]. The extracellular domain of TNFR1 contains three well-ordered cysteine-rich domains (CRD1, -2 and -3) that characterize the TNF receptor superfamily and a fourth membrane-proximal cysteine-rich division [30]. The N-terminal cysteine-rich domain,

known as the preligand binding assembly domain, favors preassembly of TNFR1 into trimeric complexes. The preligand binding assembly domain functions to prevent spontaneous receptor autoactivation and is also a prerequisite for ligand binding [31]. The intracellular part of TNFR1 contains a protein-protein interaction region called the death domain [32]. After ligand binding to the TNFR1, silencer of death domain dissociates from the intracellular death domain of TNFR1 and upon which the adapter protein TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD) is recruited that binds to the exposed death domain [33] (Fig. 1). TRADD subsequently recruits other proteins that are involved in downstream signaling, for example, TNF receptor associate factor-2 (TRAF2). It was believed that the death domain kinase, receptor-interacting protein (RIP) can also interact with the death domain of TNFR1 [34–36], however, recent research has shown that RIP can be recruited to TNFR1 independent of TRADD [37]. This membrane-bound

TNFR1 signaling complex (complex 1) rapidly initiates signaling cascades leading to NF-kB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/SAPK activation [35,38].

Upon NF-kB activation via TNFR1, TRAF2 or TRAF5 and cellular inhibitor of apoptosis-1/2 (c-IAP1/2), together with E2, ubiquitin-conjugated protein Ubc13 is associated with TRADD and RIP1 (Fig. 1). c-IAPs and both TRAF2 and TRAF5 contribute to the ubiquitination of RIP1 upon TNFR1 stimulation via ubiquitin chains linked through lysine 63 (K63) [39–41] (for more details see Wajant and Scheurich [42]). Polyubiquitinated RIP1 can act through signaling of MEKK3 and the TAK1/TAB 2 complex to activate the catalytic IkB kinase (IKK) complex, which is composed of three proteins, IKKa (IKK1), IKKβ (IKK2) and IKKγ (NF-kB essential modulator), leading to phosphorylation of inhibitor of kappaB-alpha (IkBa), the NF-kB inhibitory protein. Phospho-IkBa is then degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, allowing NF-kB to translocate

to the nucleus and initiate transcription [43,44]. Poly-ubiquitinated RIP1 can alternatively activate the IKK complex via interaction of the TAK1 complex, consisting of the TAK1 kinase and its associated proteins TAK1-binding protein 1/2/3 (TAB 1, TAB 2 and TAB 3). TAB 1–3 serve as the regulatory ubiquitin-binding subunits and trigger the allosteric activation of TAK1 [43,45], which in turn phosphorylates and activates IKK [46]. Activation of NF-κB allows it to translocate to the nucleus and initiate transcription of anti-apoptotic target genes, such as c-IAP1, c-IAP2, caspase 8 homolog FLICE-inhibitory protein, TRAF1 and TRAF2 [47] (Fig. 1). Upon release from the TNFR1 signaling complex, TRADD and RIP can also associate with Fas-associated death domain protein and caspase 8 forming a cytoplasmic complex (complex II) which was not believed to be associated with TNFR1, however, it was demonstrated by Schneider-Brachert et al. [48] that TNR1 endocytosis and death-inducing signaling complex formation are inseparable events, which can then lead to caspase cascade activation, resulting in apoptosis [35,38,49]. Activation of the classical NF-κB pathway (see Wajant and Scheurich [42]) and RIP1 ubiquitination (see O’Donnell and Ting [50]), which favorably occur during normal cellular functioning, prevent TNF-induced apoptosis [51]. However, in circumstances of deficient accessibility of c-IAP and FLICE-inhibitory protein, complex II triggers caspase 8 activation and apoptotic cell death [52].

## TNFR2 signaling pathway

Unlike TNFR1, TNFR2 does not possess a death domain and induces a long-lasting NF-κB activation [53], (Fig. 2). It has been shown that TNFR2 activation of NF-κB occurs independent of the TNFR1 signaling pathway [54]. Indeed, it has been observed in several cell lines that TNFR2 stimulation via membrane-integrated TNF-α can activate the noncanonical NF-κB pathway [55] as well as the canonical NF-κB pathway [56]. TNFR2 is preferentially activated by membrane-integrated TNF, whereas soluble TNF binds TNFR2 but fails to properly stimulate TNFR2 signaling [29]. Trimerization of TNFR2 takes place upon binding of TNF, which leads to the recruitment of TRAF2 to the intracellular TRAF-binding motif and consequently to indirect recruitment of the TRAF2-associated proteins TRAF1, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, which already interact with TRAF2 in unstimulated cells [53,57]. It has been shown that a dominant-negative mutant of TRAF2 blocks TNFR2-mediated NF-κB activation, whereas overexpression of TRAF2 causes activation of NF-κB, suggesting that

TRAF2 plays a pivotal role in TNFR2-mediated NF-κB activation [58]. In unstimulated cells, the TRAF2-c-IAP1/2 complex interacts with a complex of TRAF3 and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) resulting in c-IAP1/2-mediated ubiquitination of NIK and the subsequent proteosomal degradation of NIK. Recently, it was demonstrated in several cell lines, including primary immune cells, that only membrane-bound TNF, and not soluble TNF trimers, stimulates the noncanonical NF-κB pathway via TNFR2 stimulation by deviation of the NIK degradation-inducing TRAF2-c-IAP1/2 complex from the cytosol [55]. Thus, it was reported that TNFR2 activation results in an accumulation of NIK. NIK is then able to

stimulate IKKα. The NIK-activated IKKα in turn phosphorylates the NF-κB precursor protein p100, thus triggering its limited proteasomal proteolysis to p52, which results in activation of p52-containing NF-κBs. The noncanonical NF-κB activation is independent of NF-κB essential modulator and IKKβ [59]. TNFR2 can signal via the activation of Akt [60]. Upon exclusive stimulation of TNFR2 in neurons lacking the TNFR1, NF-κB was activated via the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/serine-threonine kinase pathway, whereas selective stimulation of TNFR1 in TNFR2−/− neurons had no influence on this pathway [56]. It has also been demonstrated that IKKα is the prime target of this pathway, which then leads to IKKβ activation and subsequent IkBα phosphorylation [61] and activation of cRel and p50/p65, indicating that NF-κB is activated via the canonical NF-κB pathway [56]. In addition, coincubation of TNF with a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, LY294002, in wild-type as well as in TNFR1−/− neurons (selective TNFR2 activation) reduced IkBα phosphorylation[56], thus indicating that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase-protein kinase B/serine-threonine kinase pathway may play a major role in TNFR2-mediated activation of NF-κB. Furthermore, NF-κB activation via TNF leads to a downregulation of the phosphatase and tensin homolog deleted on chromosome ten protein, which is a strong inhibitor of the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Thereby, this cascade may lead to an autoregulatory loop, which could lead to a persistent protein kinase B/serine-threonine kinase phosphorylation and sequentially NF-κB activation [62].

prestimulation of TNFR2 with a TNFR2 agonist causes depletion of endogenous TRAF2 [66]. c-IAP1 and c-IAP2, which were initially identified as components of the TNFR2 signaling complex are also recruited via TRAF2 into the TNFR1 signaling complex. There is evidence that the TRAF2-c-IAP1/2 complex interferes with TNFR1-associated caspase 8 activation and apoptosis induction [47,67]. Stimulation of TNFR2 leads to the recruitment of TRAF2 into a Triton X-100-insoluble compartment, and subsequent ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation via the TRAF2 associated c-IAP1 [66,68–70]. However, an important finding in that respect was that TRAF1 interferes with this process and reduces TNFR2-induced TRAF2 depletion by preserving TRAF2 in the Triton X-100-soluble fraction. Furthermore, TRAF1 rescued TNFR1-induced NF-κB and JNK activation of TNFR2-prestimulated TRAF1 transfected cells [71]. The important role of TRAF1 to induce NF-κB activation is possibly due to the preservation of cytoplasmic TRAF2.

Contradictory results regarding the regulatory effects of TRAF1 on NF-κB signaling have been reported by in vitro studies, in which overexpression of TRAF1 caused an increase [72] but also an inhibition of NF-κB activation [73]. In vivo, T cells from TRAF1-deficient mice showed enhanced NF-κB activity and increased IKKβ activity [74], but dendritic cells from TRAF1-deficient mice showed attenuated NF-κB signaling [75]. TRAF molecules form homo- or heteromeric complexes. TRAF1 strongly interacts with TRAF2 and the resulting complex plays important roles in signaling function [2]. It has been shown that the interaction of TRAF1 with TRAF2 represses TNF-induced caspase 8 activation [47]. Transgenic mice overexpressing TRAF1, for example, presented reduced antigen-induced apoptosis of CD8+ T cells [76]. Conflicting results relating to TRAF1 might, at least to some extent, be explained by the competence of this molecule to manipulate the interaction of TRAF2 with TRAF2-interacting receptors [66]. Interestingly, in a study in which TRAF1-transfected cell lines were used, it was shown that TRAF1 is corecruited together with TRAF2 to TNFR1 signaling complex without affecting RIP modification or IKKα recruitment [71]. Under these conditions, the amount of TRAF2 recruitment to the TNFR1 complex was relatively reduced. Thus, TRAF1 can act as a substitute for TRAF2 in TNFR1 signaling as long as it is part of a heteromeric complex with TRAF2 [71]. In addition, TRAF2 recruitment to TNFR2 was also partially reduced in these TRAF1-transfected cells. Moreover, it can be speculated that heteromeric TRAF1-TRAF2

Involvement of TRAF1 and TRAF2 in the cross-talk of TNFR1 and TNFR2

Contrary to the general belief that TNFR1 signaling can cause apoptosis and that TNFR2 signaling pathway primarily induces pro-survival, there is convincing evidence that exclusive TNFR2 stimulation can trigger some cells to undergo apoptosis despite the fact that TNFR2 does not contain a death domain [63,64]. For this reason, it was speculated that some form of receptor cross-talk might take place between TNFR1 and TNFR2, especially via the involvement of TRAFs, which has been confirmed by more recent research. TRAFs are pivotal to TNF-α signaling and are recruited to both TNFR1 and TNFR2 complexes to commence cellular signaling [65]. TRAF2 plays a crucial role in TNFR1-mediated activation of c-Jun as well as NF-κB, which is essential for cellular survival. These pathways can be inhibited by TNFR2-mediated depletion of TRAF2 [66].

complexes are more efficient to activate NF-κB than homomeric TRAF2 complexes in TNFR2 signaling [53,71]. This suggests that TRAF1 can substitute for TRAF2 in TNFR1 as well as TNFR2 signaling complex formation (Fig. 3).

Of note, TRAF1 is transcriptionally upregulated by NF-κB [65,72], and degradation of TRAF2 is triggered by TNFR2 signaling [65,77]. It can therefore be expected that the duration of NF-κB activation can shift the balance of the TRAF1/TRAF2 ratio. There might possibly be an alteration in the ratio of TRAF1 to TRAF2 that differs from normal cellular conditions to inflammatory conditions. Costimulation of TNFR1 and TNFR2 can occur in the presence of cells expressing membrane TNF. In a study, it was observed that although specific stimulation of either TNFR1 or TNFR2 initially increased NF-κB, only TNFR2 induced cell proliferation of murine fibroblasts [78].

This can be explained by the signaling kinetics in the activation of NF-κB differs considerably between TNFR1 and TNFR2 upon stimulation via TNF-α. After stimulation via TNFR1, NF-κB is activated for ~1–3 h, whereas TNFR2-mediated NF-κB activation lasts for up to 24 h after stimulation [56]. Thus, in the initial phase of TNF stimulation via its two receptors, NF-κB activation via TNFR1 will take place before TNFR2-induced depletion of TRAF2 has occurred. TNFR1 is internalized rapidly into the cell and further TNFR1 signaling will primarily depend on the activation of new receptor molecules emerging on the plasma membrane. During stimulation of the newly formed TNFR1, an environment in which TRAF2 has already been degraded via TNFR2 stimulation will be present. TNFR1–TNFR2 co-signaling becomes even more complex because TNFR2-induced TRAF2 degradation occurs only momentarily, which is then hampered by

the upregulation of TRAF1 via earlier TNFR1 activation, thus diminishing cytoplasmic TRAF2 downregulation. Moreover, induction of endogenous membrane TNF might further promote TRAF1 to upregulate its own production by enhancing TNFR2-induced NF-κB signaling. This regulatory mechanism during long-term TNF stimulation in TNFR1 and TNFR2 coexpressing cells might explain the interaction between these two receptors to prevent apoptosis by sustained NF-κB activation [71].

### Receptor cross-talk via regulation of ASK1

Apoptosis signal-regulating kinase-1 (ASK1), a member of the MAPK kinase kinase family, associates with TRAF2 to induce the p38 and JNK activation upon TNF stimulation [51, 79]. During TNFR2 stimulation, c-IAP1 and c-IAP2 are recruited to the receptor complex. The c-IAP1 protein, in particular, induces TRAF2 degradation via ubiquitin protein ligase E3 activity [69]. This then can lead to an early termination of the TNF-induced JNK pathway upon TNFR2 stimulation. Interestingly, Zhao *et al.* showed that ASK1 is ubiquitinated in TNFR2 expressing cell lines as well as in resting B cells via E3 activity of c-IAP1, and that c-IAP1⁻/⁻ B cells did not succeed to hinder TNF-induced MAP kinase signaling [80]. In addition, it has also been suggested that TNFR2, which is upregulated during inflammatory conditions, may control TNFR1 activation via a feedback mechanism by reducing JNK activation.

### Conclusion

The physiological and mechanistic involvement of TNFR2 in the functioning of TNF has long been underestimated for several reasons. Soluble TNF has been used to study the effects of TNF, which predominantly stimulates TNFR1 and poorly activates TNFR2. In addition, it was shown that only soluble and not membrane-bound TNF triggers the expression of alveolar monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 via TNFR2 in alveolar epithelial cells, which append more complexity to the signaling of TNFR2 [20]. TNFR2 also has restricted expression in specific cell types. It is also sometimes difficult to measure detectable receptor expression under normal physiological conditions. Cross-talk between TNFR1 and TNFR2 occurs on multiple levels. First, signaling kinetics differ significantly between the two receptors. TNFR1-induced NF-κB activation can occur in a matter of minutes and normalize in a few hours, whereas TNFR2 can take a few hours to promote NF-κB activation and

then can stay active for longer. Second, cross-talk between the receptors can contribute to antagonistic as well as agonistic effects of the two receptors on each other’s signaling pathways. Third, the amount of receptor expression can contribute to the complexity of the cross-talk between receptors. This was shown by Fontaine *et al.* [23], where receptor expression of TNFR1 and TNFR2 were only detectable in neuronal tissue after it was subjected to a stressful environment.

Cross-talk of the receptors can play a pivotal role in physiological processes of many entirely different aspects in the living organism. It has been shown that TNFR1 is required for hepatocyte DNA synthesis and liver regeneration [81], however, in an acute hepatocyte toxicity model TNFR1 plays a detrimental role in liver destruction [82], possibly due to upregulation of TNFR1. Fascinatingly, transgenic mice expressing noncleavable transmembrane TNF in endothelial cells were protected against Concanavalin A-induced liver failure [83]. This protective effect can be attributed to the increased binding affinity of membrane-bound TNF to TNFR2. The same effect on tissue destruction and protection was observed in brain tissue [23]. Furthermore, it has been reported that TNFR1 and TNFR2 in concert are involved in cognitive behaviors under normal physiological conditions [84].

TNF has a diversity of functions which is not solely restricted to either TNFR1 or TNFR2 signaling, but rather is dependent on the temporal dynamics of cross-talk between TNFR1 and TNFR2 according to the physiological conditions in which it occurs.
