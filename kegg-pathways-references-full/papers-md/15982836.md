### Abstract

Advances in our understanding of the complexity of GnRH actions at the pituitary and the various mechanisms involved in mediating differential LH and FSH biosynthesis and secretion at the gonadotrope, are continually emerging. In this review, we summarise recent studies pertaining to GnRH and GnRH receptor phylogeny, the divergent signalling and trafficking pathways initiated and utilised by GnRH and its receptor, and the pathways that mediate gonadotropin secretion from the gonadotrope.

### 1. Introduction

In other papers in this volume, the pattern of GnRH secretion, and the regulation of GnRH receptor expression will be discussed. Thus, in this paper we will concentrate on the signalling events following the activation of the GnRH receptor subtypes which have been analysed in a large number of different species. Exciting information is accumulating in several fields of investigation, including ligand and receptor structure and phylogeny.

receptor signal transduction pathways, and trafficking, and the pathways leading to the synthesis and secretion of LH and FSH. Recent advances are summarised in the following sections. While the main focus of this review is on the GnRH system in domestic animals, we do occasionally call attention to studies based on other vertebrate species in order to highlight the divergent nature of GnRH receptor-mediated processes.

2. Phylogeny of GnRHs and GnRH receptors

2.1. GnRH structural variants

There are currently 23 identified naturally occurring GnRH structural variants across the vertebrate species (Millar et al., 2004; Morgan and Millar, 2004) and most vertebrates studied possess at least two forms of GnRH. The hypothalamic form of GnRH is designated GnRH-I, and is variable in structure (Sealfon et al., 1997). In contrast, GnRH-II (chicken GnRH-II) is ubiquitously expressed and its ligand structure has been conserved from bony fish to man, suggesting that it has critical and specific functions. The diverse roles of GnRH-II in reproductive biology have recently been reviewed (Millar, 2003; Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c; Millar et al., 2004; Morgan and Millar, 2004). In many vertebrate species a third conserved form of GnRH occurs and is designated GnRH-III (salmon GnRH) and occurs only in teleosts (White et al., 1998). The presence of three GnRH forms in many vertebrate species suggested the existence of three cognate GnRH receptor subtypes and when the primary amino acid structures of all the cloned GnRH receptors are aligned and subjected to phylogenetic analysis, it becomes apparent that the receptors can indeed be grouped into three distinct subtypes: types I, II and III (Millar et al., 2004; Morgan and Millar, 2004).

2.2. Type I and II GnRH receptor system in domestic animal reproduction

While the type I GnRH receptor is accepted as the classic pituitary GnRH receptor, the type II GnRH receptor is more widely distributed. It is expressed throughout the brain, including areas associated with reproductive behaviour, and in some species is thought to be co-expressed in pituitary gonadotropes with the type I GnRH receptor, suggesting that it may have a distinct role in gonadotrope function. The extensive tissue distribution of the type II GnRH receptor, including non-neural and many reproductive organs in certain species, suggests that it may have a variety of functions (Millar, 2003). Type II GnRH receptors display high ligand selectivity for GnRH-II and bind GnRH-I poorly (Millar et al., 2001). Nevertheless, despite the conservation of the GnRH-II ligand throughout evolution, the expression of the type II GnRH receptor has been silenced in the human and chimp (Morgan et al., 2003), bovine (Millar et al., 2004), ovine (Gault et al., 2004), and rat (Millar et al., 2004; Morgan and Millar, 2004) genomes. In contrast, the marmoset (Millar et al., 2001), African green and rhesus monkeys (Neill et al., 2001), and pig (Morgan et al., 2003) have all retained the presence of a functional type II GnRH receptor. Given that the type I GnRH receptor is capable of binding both GnRH-I and GnRH-II with high affinity, it is conceivable that it may have adopted a role as the cognate receptor for GnRH-II in those animals that have apparently lost a functional type II GnRH receptor.

Two recent studies performed on primary monkey pituitary cultures and in vivo on Rhesus monkeys (Densmore and Urbanski, 2003; Okada et al., 2003) have demonstrated that both GnRH-I and GnRH-II are capable of acting via the type I GnRH receptor to stimulate LH and FSH release, and that GnRH-II-induced LH release is completely blocked by combined treatment with a type I GnRH receptor-specific antagonist. The monkey type II GnRH receptors (Millar et al., 2001; Neill et al., 2001) are highly selective for GnRH-II and bind GnRH-I poorly, questioning the physiological role of the type II GnRH receptor. Its cognate ligand GnRH-II may play a role in stimulating gonadotropin release in vivo through the type I GnRH receptor, even though type II GnRH receptors are co-expressed with type I GnRH receptors in the majority of marmoset gonadotropes (Millar et al., 2001). Certainly, it has been well established that GnRH-I is sufficient to regulate the biosynthesis and secretion of LH and FSH (Millar et al., 2001 and references therein), and that the differential secretion of LH and FSH during the mammalian ovarian cycle may be adequately accounted for by changes in the frequency of GnRH-I pulses from the hypothalamus, GnRH receptor density at the gonadotrope cell surface, and the modulatory effects of gonadal steroids (androgen, estrogen, and progesterone) and peptides (activin, inhibin, and follistatin) (Padmanabhan and McNeilly, 2001). Furthermore, an additional mechanism for differential gonadotropin synthesis and secretion is now being proposed, in which GnRH activates different signalling cascades to regulate differential gonadotropin subunit gene expression (see below). It now seems more plausible that the type II GnRH receptor, and its cognate ligand GnRH-II, have a unique function in the monkey brain, other than regulating gonadotropin secretion, perhaps as a neuromodulator, or in neural development, or in stimulating reproductive behaviour (Millar et al., 2001; Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c). Since sheep apparently do not possess a functional type II GnRH receptor (Gault et al., 2004), both GnRH-I and GnRH-II must interact via the type I GnRH receptor. A recent series of studies in the ram suggested that GnRH-II is not the physiological regulator of gonadotropin release in mammals since administration of two type I GnRH receptor-specific antagonists blocked GnRH-II-induced gonadotropin release while simultaneous administration of GnRH-II failed to alter GnRH-I-induced LH release (Gault et al., 2003). Thus, the loss of the type II GnRH receptor in certain species suggests that gonadotropin biosynthesis and secretion at the pituitary gonadotrope is mediated by GnRH interactions via the type I GnRH receptor.

## Divergent signalling of the GnRH receptor

The receptor for GnRH is a member of the rhodopsin-like G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family and predominantly couples the Gq/11 family of G proteins in various cellular environments (Stojilkovic et al., 1994). GPCRs are characterised structurally as seven transmembrane-spanning helices, linked by consecutive extracellular and intracellular loops, and bearing an extracellular amino-terminal domain, which may be glycosylated, and a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail, which may be palmitoylated. In general, the extracellular domains and/or transmembrane regions are involved in the formation of the ligand-binding pocket, whereas the cytoplasmic regions present sites for interactions with G proteins and other intracellular regulatory proteins (Stojilkovic et al., 1994; Sealfon et

A.J. Pawson, A.S. McNeilly / Animal Reproduction Science 88 (2005) 75–94

It is now widely accepted that GnRH can mediate the activation of multiple signal transduction pathways in different cell types. In gonadotropes, GnRH activates phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ) via Gq/11α, resulting in the hydrolysis of membrane-bound phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol, which mobilise intracellular calcium and activate protein kinase C (PKC), respectively. These in turn stimulate the biosynthesis and secretion of LH and FSH. In many GPCRs, the cytoplasmic tail region has been demonstrated to play a crucial regulatory role in agonist-induced receptor signalling, desensitisation, and intracellular trafficking (Ferguson, 2001). Interestingly, the mammalian type I GnRH receptors are unique among the rhodopsin-like GPCR superfamily, because they completely lack a cytoplasmic carboxyl-terminal tail (Sealfon et al., 1997), and do not show rapid desensitisation (Davidson et al., 1994). In contrast to this, but in common with other GPCRs, all the mammalian type II GnRH receptors and all the non-mammalian GnRH receptors have a carboxyl-terminal tail (Sealfon et al., 1997; Millar et al., 2004). The implications of this unique feature of the mammalian type I GnRH receptors are highlighted in the following sections relating to GnRH receptor signalling and intracellular trafficking. Additionally, we consider the concept of the coordinated co-localisation or scaffolding of signalling molecules and structural proteins in relation to the GnRH receptor system.

In addition to coupling to Gq/11, a number of studies have demonstrated that other G proteins can mediate the actions of GnRH receptors. The intracellular loops and carboxyl-terminal tail have been implicated in the coupling of GPCRs to G proteins. Since all the mammalian GnRH receptors lack a carboxyl-terminal tail, effective receptor-G protein interactions must occur via the intracellular loops. A number of studies have shown that the GnRH receptor is capable of coupling to several G proteins and activate a number of effectors (Millar et al., 2004; Millar and Pawson, 2004) via different elements of the three intracellular loops, and it appears that coupling to Gq/11 occurs through intracellular loops-2 and -3, and to Gs through intracellular loop-1 (reviewed in Cheng and Leung, 2000; Millar et al., 2004). In certain tissues it is suggested that the GnRH receptor couples to Gi signalling pathways (Grundker et al., 2000; Everest et al., 2001; Maudsley et al., 2004; Millar and Pawson, 2004). However, the intracellular loop elements for Gi coupling have not been delineated.

The carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs have also been implicated in the regulation of signalling via receptor-coupled G proteins. Many studies have established the importance of this region for coupling (Vrecl et al., 1998; Blomenrohr et al., 1999; Heding et al., 2000; Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c), desensitisation (reviewed in McArdle et al., 1999) and receptor internalisation of GnRH receptors (see below). Although mammalian type I GnRH receptors lack the cytoplasmic tail, the carboxyl-terminal residues of TM7 are important for Gq/11 effector coupling (Brothers et al., 2002). Since the carboxyl-terminal four residues (YFSL) are conserved in all mammalian type I GnRH receptors, they may be important for effective mammalian GnRH receptor signal transduction processes particularly through interactions with members of the PDZ domain-containing membrane ‘scaffold’ protein family (Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c). Multi-molecular complexes of receptors, signalling molecules, and structural proteins are thought to be pre-assembled at the cell surface and PDZ domain-containing proteins are the scaffolding proteins at the centre of these complexes, enhancing the rate and fidelity of signal transduction processes. PDZ (PSD-95, Dlg, ZO-1; after the first three

family members cloned) domains are ~90 residue domains present in multiple repeats that interact with the carboxyl-terminal 4–5 residues (the PDZ domain-binding motif) of the target protein ([Sheng and Sala, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm761)). There are three classes of PDZ domain-binding motifs at the carboxyl-terminus of the target protein (classes I–III) ([Sheng and Sala, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm761)) and the potential for internal motif recognition, but only when presented in the context of a β-hairpin ([Harris et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M101484200)). The carboxyl-terminal YFSL sequence in the type I GnRH receptor is a putative class II PDZ domain-binding motif, while the carboxyl-terminal residues of the marmoset type II GnRH receptor (ITSI) conforms to a classical class I PDZ domain-binding motif ([Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm1170)).

Through coupling to G<sub>q/11</sub> and PKC activation, GnRH receptor occupancy may lead to the activation of the four key mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) subfamilies, which includes the extracellular signal regulated protein kinase (ERK), the c-Jun N-terminal protein kinase (JNK), the p38 MAPK, and the big MAPK (BMK) cascades and has been the subject of recent comprehensive reviews ([Naor et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4603(00)00010-2); [Kraus et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0306-4603(01)00125-9)). In more recent studies, it has been demonstrated in LβT2 cells that ERK activation induces c-fos and LHβ gene expression, and that this signalling process occurs by GnRH receptor activation of both G<sub>q/11</sub> and G<sub>s</sub> ([Harris et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200); [Liu et al., 2002a,b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200)), further implicating coupling of the GnRH receptor to multiple G proteins and the activation of different MAPK signalling cascades to regulate selective gonadotropin subunit expression. Activation of ERK in LβT2 cells may regulate basal and GnRH-induced α-subunit and LHβ-subunit expression, while JNK activation regulates basal and GnRH-stimulated LHβ-subunit expression, both ERK and JNK involving c-Src participation ([Harris et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200) and references therein). Differential regulation of LH and FSH secretion in the tilapia is also achieved through divergent signalling via the GnRH receptor, with expression of α-subunit and LHβ-subunit mRNAs being increased by activation of the ERK cascade, while induction FSHβ transcript expression is ERK-independent and is regulated by the cAMP-PKA signalling cascades ([Gur et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200)). While it has been demonstrated that two activator protein-1 (AP-1) elements located in the proximal FSHβ promoter are not involved in GnRH regulation of FSHβ gene expression, GnRH activation of the ERK cascade in LβT2 cells is reported to regulate FSHβ gene expression ([Vasilyev et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200)). GnRH activation of MAPK cascades not only regulates gonadotropin subunit gene expression, but also regulation of the GnRH receptor gene. GnRH activation of the JNK pathway regulates the activation of AP-1 that acts via the AP-1 element in the GnRH receptor promoter to drive endogenous GnRH receptor gene expression in αT3-1 cells ([Ellsworth et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200)).

## Calcium signalling

GnRH receptor occupancy leads to a rise in intracellular calcium levels derived in part from IP3-activated intracellular storage pools and from the influx of calcium from extracellular fluid through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels ([Stojilkovic et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200)). The importance of calcium, in addition to the ERK pathway, in the regulation of LHβ subunit expression is further supported by a recent study in LβT2 cells showing that GnRH induces the activation of Calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinase type II (Ca/CaMK II), which is mediated by the elevation of intracellular calcium levels ([Haisenleder et al.,](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109870200))

A.J. Pawson, A.S. McNeilly / Animal Reproduction Science 88 (2005) 75–94

2003). Ca/CaMK II probably acts at one or more GnRH-sensitive transcription factors at the LHβ subunit promoter to regulate LH expression.

## Organisation of GnRH receptor signalling complexes by scaffolding proteins and localisation to distinct membrane microdomains

The roles of both heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins in divergent GnRH receptor signalling have recently been described (Davidson et al., 2004). GnRH receptor occupancy leads to dramatic changes in cell adhesion and superstructural morphology, in the form of actin cytoskeleton remodelling, and that these effects are mediated by FAK/c-Src/ERK activation at focal adhesion complexes, and are not dependent on PKC and intracellular calcium mobilisation (Davidson et al., 2004). In relation to this, the importance of the focal adhesion complex, and in particular the focal adhesion kinase Pyk2, in signalling via the ERK pathway to LHβ gene transcription in the gonadotrope (LβT2), has now been established (Maudsley et al., 2001). Clearly, the elucidation of all the components of focal adhesions sites will provide further important insights into the regulation of gonadotrope function.

In addition to heterotrimeric and monomeric G proteins, the involvement in GnRH receptor-mediated signalling of regulators of G protein signalling (RGS) proteins has also been shown. RGS proteins interact directly with active Gα-subunits to accelerate their intrinsic GTPase activity and limit their half-life (Koelle, 1997). RGS3 and RGS10 have been implicated in the regulation of GnRH receptor coupling (Neill et al., 1997; Castro-Fernandez and Conn, 2002; Castro-Fernandez et al., 2002), and there is evidence that the carboxyl-terminal tail of non-mammalian GnRH receptors may contain elements for interactions with RGS10, although the nature of this interaction is unclear (Castro-Fernandez and Conn, 2002).

Endogenous GnRH receptors in αT3-1 cells have been demonstrated to be constitutively localised to low density membrane microdomains known as lipid-rafts, and require this localisation for GnRH signalling to ERK activation (Navratil et al., 2003). In relation to this, caveolae, flask-shaped membrane microdomains, have been reported to be essential for certain receptor signalling and internalisation events (Anderson, 1998). It has been demonstrated that β2-adrenergic receptors are initially localised within caveolae in neonatal myocytes prior to their internalisation via a β-arrestin-dependent clathrin-mediated pathway, and that this localisation is essential for efficient signalling (Xiang et al., 2002). In relation to this, the chicken GnRH receptor has been reported to localise to caveolae, and undergo rapid agonist-induced internalisation via these membrane microdomains (Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c)(see below). Caveolae are thought to promote the initial formation of ligand-receptor-G-protein complexes and subsequent second messenger production for certain GPCRs, by concentrating and increasing the proximity of the various components involved. Certainly, many species of G proteins, including Gq/11, are known to be enriched in caveolae compartments (Sargiacomo et al., 1993; Lisanti et al., 1994). The finding that lipid-raft/caveolae microdomains are present in gonadotropes and are essential for GnRH receptor signalling provides a further level to the complexity of signalling pathway organisation required for gonadotropin secretion. Perhaps differential LH and FSH synthesis and

secretion is achieved through the activation of GnRH receptors coupled to distinct signalling pathways that are scaffolded and initiated in distinct membrane microdomains or compartments?

The sequence structural motifs within the GnRH receptors required to promote interactions with the various components involved in GnRH receptor-mediated signalling have not yet been properly identified. The organisation of GnRH receptor signalling pathways will become even more clear as we begin to identify the molecular composition of GnRH receptors complexed with scaffolding proteins, signalling molecules, and the structural proteins that form part of the various membrane microdomains and compartments, and focal adhesion sites (Millar et al., 2004; Millar and Pawson, 2004).

## 6. Recent insights into the mechanism for pituitary gonadotrope desensitisation in response to GnRH

As discussed earlier, the carboxyl-terminal tail of GPCRs has been implicated in the processes of rapid desensitisation and internalisation of GPCRs. Following GPCR activation, G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs) are targeted to the receptor by the generation of free βγ-subunits. Activated GRKs phosphorylate the receptor at specific serine and threonine residues, often within the carboxyl-terminal tail. Receptor phosphorylation enhances the binding of β-arrestin, which leads to G protein uncoupling and also serves to target the desensitised receptors for internalisation, after which they may be either proteolytically degraded or resensitised and recycled back to the cell surface.

The absence of a carboxyl-terminal tail in mammalian type I GnRH receptors is correlated with a lack of rapid desensitisation (Davidson et al., 1994), in contrast to non-mammalian type I and all type II and III tailed GnRH receptors which exhibit rapid desensitisation. Despite there being no short-term rapid desensitisation of mammalian GnRH receptors, there is a marked suppression of GnRH-mediated calcium response and uncoupling of IP3 production in αT3-1 cells in response to chronic GnRH receptor activation by GnRH (McArdle et al., 1995; Willars et al., 1996). This is due to down-regulation of IP3 receptors at intracellular calcium storage pools (Willars et al., 2001), by a GnRH-induced rapid increase in IP3 receptor polyubiquitination, thereby targeting them for degradation via the ubiquitin/proteosome pathway (Wojcikiewicz et al., 2003). Chronic GnRH treatment has also been demonstrated to rapidly down-regulate PLA₂ and PLD activity, suggesting that a host of second messenger activities are affected (Poulin et al., 1998). Indeed, the desensitising effect of sustained GnRH treatment on more distal downstream signalling pathways, including the ERK and p38 MAPK cascades which are coupled to GnRH receptor activation in LβT2 cells, has now been shown (Liu et al., 2003).

## 7. Divergent intracellular trafficking of GnRH receptors

At least four pathways for agonist-induced internalisation of GPCRs exist (Claing et al., 2000). The classical GPCR internalisation pathway, as typified by the β₂-adrenergic receptor, proceeds via clathrin-coated pits, and involves G protein-coupled receptor kinases

(GRKs), β-arrestin, and the GTPase dynamin (Ferguson, 2001). Dynamin is thought to be necessary for the scission of clathrin-coated vesicles from the plasma membrane (De Camilli et al., 1995). GPCRs have also been reported to internalise independently of both β-arrestin and dynamin, implying that GPCRs are able to undergo internalisation via pathways that are distinct from clathrin-coated pits (Claing et al., 2000; Ferguson, 2001). As discussed above, caveolae membrane microdomains have been implicated in the internalisation of certain GPCRs (Anderson, 1998). Dynamin has been implicated in caveolae function, although its exact functional role is not known (Henley et al., 1998; Oh et al., 1998).

The internalisation pathways utilised by GnRH receptors differ between receptor subtypes (Table 1). The lack of a carboxyl-terminal domain in the mammalian type I GnRH receptors probably accounts for their β-arrestin-independency for internalisation (Table 1). This region has been extensively reported to mediate receptor interactions with β-arrestin (Ferguson, 2001). Murine GnRH receptors undergo a slow rate of internalisation in αT3-1 and LβT2 cells (Pawson, A.J., unpublished observations), and the internalisation of human type I GnRH receptor after expression in αT4 pituitary cells proceeds at a slow rate and is β-arrestin-independent (Hislop et al., 2000). This is in contrast to the xenopus type I GnRH receptor, which possesses a carboxyl-terminal tail and internalises more rapidly in a β-arrestin-dependent manner when expressed in αT4 cells (Hislop et al., 2000). It appears that both mammalian and non-mammalian GnRH receptors can both be targeted for clathrin-mediated internalisation, regardless of their β-arrestin-dependence (Table 1). The catfish and chicken GnRH receptors both exhibit rapid internalisation kinetics and were shown to be dependent on their carboxyl-terminal tail domains for this process (Blomenrohr et al., 1997; Pawson et al., 1998; Blomenrohr et al., 1999). A threonine-doublet located at the distal end of the chicken GnRH receptor cytoplasmic tail was shown to be critical, as was a membrane proximal cysteine residue (Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c). The chicken GnRH receptor

was shown to preferentially undergo rapid agonist-induced internalisation in a dynamin- and caveolae-dependent manner, and palmitoylation of the membrane proximal cysteine residue may serve to target the chicken GnRH receptor to caveolae microdomains for signalling and internalisation (Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c). The internalisation pathways of the three bullfrog GnRH receptor subtypes have been partially characterised (Acharjee et al., 2002). The bullfrog type I GnRH receptor was shown to internalise via a β-arrestin and dynamin-dependent pathway, whereas the bullfrog type II and III GnRH receptors internalise via a pathway that is β-arrestin-independent, but dynamin-dependent, similar to the pathway utilised by the chicken GnRH receptor (Acharjee et al., 2002; Pawson et al., 2003a,b,c). The above studies thus suggest that the carboxyl-terminal tail of the non-mammalian GnRH receptors plays a pivotal role in their function and subcellular trafficking to divergent internalisation pathways. It has now become evident that the internalisation pathway utilised by a particular receptor may not necessarily be dictated by the primary G protein species to which the receptor couples. While bullfrog types I and III GnRH receptors are able to couple to both Gq/11 and Gs with similar efficiencies, the bullfrog type II GnRH receptor preferentially couples to Gs (Oh da et al., 2003). The sequence motifs and structural elements within the carboxyl-terminal domains of the tailed GnRH receptors that determine which internalisation pathway will be utilised have yet to be properly elucidated. In general, the lack of the carboxyl-terminal tail in the mammalian type I GnRH receptors has led to their poor internalisation, whereas those GnRH receptors with carboxyl-terminal tails display relatively rapid rates of agonist-induced internalisation (Fig. 1).

Further downstream of the initial signalling and trafficking events that are initiated by GnRH receptor occupancy at the gonadotrope cell surface, are the processes directly

involved in the biosynthesis and secretion of LH and FSH. Recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms that drive these processes are highlighted in the following sections (Fig. 2).

# GnRH and the secretion of LH and FSH

## Direct association

Although during the preovulatory LH surge in the oestrous cycle there is coincidental release of both LH and a small amount of FSH (Baird et al., 1981) during the rest of the estrous cycle and testis growth cycle in rams (McNeilly et al., 2002), there is a clear difference in the patterns of FSH and LH secretion with FSH levels often increasing before LH and declining when LH release is increasing. Furthermore, while measurement of FSH and LH in the peripheral circulation show that there is a basal release of FSH and LH, only LH appears to be released in a clear pulsatile manner with no close relationship to the release patterns of FSH. This could relate to the differences in the clearance from plasma of LH (t₁/₂ 20 min) and FSH (t₁/₂ 150 min) (Padmanabhan and Sharma, 2001) since GnRH can evoke a similar pattern of FSH and LH release when GnRH is pulsed into primary ovine pituitary cells during perfusion (McIntosh and McIntosh, 1986). However, in longer term primary ovine pituitary cell cultures FSH secretion increases in the absence of GnRH while LH secretion declines (Tsonis et al., 1986; Farnworth, 1995). Thus, it appears that while both LH and FSH are released from the gonadotrope in a basal manner independent of GnRH and the associated changes in intracellular calcium (Kile and Nett, 1994), only the release of pulses of LH is totally dependent on pulsatile GnRH input.

Recent studies in which the release patterns of FSH and LH were examined in hypophysial portal (Padmanabhan et al., 1997) or cavernous sinus (Clarke et al., 2002) blood samples thus collected very close to pituitary in vivo have shown that while there is a high degree of synchrony between the pulsatile release of GnRH and LH, FSH release is only associated with a small proportion of the GnRH pulses. Furthermore, the episodic secretion of FSH continues when GnRH input is blocked by GnRH antagonist treatment (Padmanabhan et al., 2003). Since LH and FSH are present in the same gonadotrope (Taragnat et al., 1998; Crawford and McNeilly, 2002) this asynchrony between the release of FSH and LH supports the concept that LH and FSH are released by separate mechanisms from the cell (McNeilly, 1988; Farnworth, 1995; McNeilly et al., 2003), and while GnRH is crucial for pulsatile release of LH, basal secretion of LH and the majority of FSH secretion occurs independently of signals arising from the GnRH receptor to the release mechanisms.

Although there is no close association between pulsatile GnRH stimulation and the release of FSH it is clear that GnRH pulse frequency does influence gonadotrophin secretion independently of pulsatile secretion. A complete absence of GnRH input, e.g. after GnRH agonist results reduced plasma concentrations of both LH and FSH associated with reduced levels of mRNA for LHβ and FSHβ subunits (McNeilly et al., 1991). Slow GnRH pulse input preferentially increases FSH secretion while fast frequency pulses, e.g. hourly, favour LH secretion (see Padmanabhan and McNeilly, 2001). Thus, GnRH is crucial for the activation

Fig. 2. Schematic summary of pituitary gonadotrope signalling and trafficking pathways leading from GnRH receptor agonist occupancy to LH and FSH secretion. Cell surface GnRH receptors and components of the GnRH signalling pathways may be pre-assembled in signalling complexes, which are organised by PDZ domain-containing scaffold proteins. Agonist occupancy of the GnRH receptor initiates signalling towards the MAPK cascades, which drive the biosynthesis of LHβ, FSHβ and αGSU gonadotropin subunits. After synthesis and transport through the Golgi, FSH and some LH and free αGSU exits the gonadotrope via a GnRH-independent constitutive pathway. In contrast most LH associates with secretogranin II (SgII) into electron-dense storage granules which are released in response to local increases in Ca²⁺ at the cell membrane, induced by GnRH.

of both the LHβ and FSHβ genes, but only directly controls the pulsatile secretion of LH, and a minimal number of co-incident FSH episodes of secretion.

### 8.2. Indirect association

GnRH could affect the secretion of both LH and FSH indirectly by altering the production of either or both LH and FSH, affecting the amount available for release from the gonadotrope, but not actually causing the release directly. As described earlier in this review, activation of the GnRH receptor leads to a cascade of signalling events that affects the transcription of the LHβ, FSHβ and αGSU genes. However, during the estrous cycle in non-rodent species there is little evidence for any significant change in levels of LHβ mRNA in spite of large changes in the secretion pattern of LH even just before or during the preovulatory LH surge when over 80% of the pituitary LH content is released and GnRH release is maximal (Currie and McNeilly, 1995; Crawford et al., 2000, 2004; Crawford and McNeilly, 2002). Indeed during the follicular phase in the sheep cycle there is a decrease in LHβ transcription (Brown and McNeilly, 1997) but an increase in polyadenylation of the LHβ mRNA that would enhance stability (Crawford and McNeilly, 2002). Thus, it appears that the changes in the release of LH occurs almost independently of any acute effect of GnRH on LHβ gene expression, the GnRH action being to activate then maintain expression, while releasing preformed stores of LH (McNeilly et al., 2003). This is a classic regulated pathway of release.

In contrast, the release and subsequent plasma concentrations of FSH appear to much more closely related to the amount of FSH being produced within the gonadotrope, and hence to the levels of transcription and FSHβ mRNA (McNeilly et al., 2003). In sheep (McNeilly et al., 1991) and cows (Vizcarra et al., 1997) pituitary levels of FSH are 10- to 50-fold lower than LH suggesting a very small gonadotrope storage component in FSH secretion (McNeilly, 1988). As described above, transcription of the FSHβ gene is activated by GnRH signalling, but of equal or more importance is the action of intra-gonadotrope activin in stimulating FSHβ transcription, an effect greatly amplified through a synergistic interaction with GnRH (see Miller et al., 2002; Nicol et al., 2004). Activin appears to stabilise FSHβ mRNA (Attardi and Winters, 1993) and stimulates FSH secretion and FSHβ promoter activation (Miller et al., 2002; Vasilyev et al., 2002) through the Smad-2 pathway (Dupont et al., 2003) although other activin-activated pathways may interact with GnRH to cause enhancement of FSHβ gene expression (see Miller et al., 2002; Miller et al., 2002). The actions of activin are modulated by both follistatin produced by the pituitary (Farnworth, 1995) which acts as an activin binding protein and, of particular importance, inhibin, produced by the testes and ovary, which initially binds to the activin type II receptor, thus blocking activin binding to its receptors (Bernard et al., 2002). The putative inhibin A receptor beta-glycan (Lewis et al., 2000), present on sheep gonadotropes (AS McNeilly and M Millar, unpublished observations), was first identified as TGFβ type III receptor and also binds TGFβs which may then modulate the binding of inhibin (Ethier et al., 2002). The putative inhibin B receptor P120 or InhBP was initially cloned from bovine pituitaries (Bernard et al., 2002). These putative inhibin receptors, which appear to comprise either a combination of activin II receptor and beta-glycan, or the P120 receptor do not apparently activate a second messenger signalling pathway, but neutralise the positive action

of activin in stimulating FSHβ expression ([Bernard et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M203586200)). Immuneutralisation of inhibin during the estrous cycle increases FSH levels in plasma ([Mann et al., 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(89)90004-8)) while treatment with inhibin suppresses FSH secretion associated with a decrease in FSHβ mRNA levels (e.g. [Brooks et al., 1992](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(92)90004-8); [Clarke et al., 1993](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(93)90004-8)). However, this decrease in FSHβ mRNA levels is greater than the effect on FSHβ rate of transcription suggesting that the withdrawal of activin signalling is not only reducing transcription rates, but also removing the stabilising effect of activin on FSHβ mRNA. The mechanism through which this stabilising effect occurs is unknown. However, the long 3′-UTR of the FSHβ mRNA is intrinsically unstable, and replacement with a short 3′-UTR increases the stability of the ovine FSHβ mRNA in vitro ([Mountford et al., 1989](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(89)90004-8)) and in vivo in mice ([Brown et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00200-8)). More recently an inhibitory effect of BMPs on the secretion of FSH in sheep pituitary gonadotropes in vitro has been identified and BMPs will prevent activin induction of FSH mRNA and secretion, and is additive to the negative effects of estradiol on FSH secretion ([Faure et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2005.01.001)). All components of the BMP pathways including the BMP receptors II and IA, but not IB are present in gonadotropes, but how the inhibitory BMP system interacts with activins, GnRH and inhibin in vivo to regulate FSH secretion is still to be determined.

Estradiol in females ([Clarke, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00004-8); in vivo: [Mann et al., 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(90)90004-8); in vitro: see [Miller et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00004-8)), and testosterone in males ([Tilbrook et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00004-8)) suppress FSH secretion by a direct action at the pituitary, overriding any GnRH input. Estrogen acts through ERα receptors present in gonadotropes ([Sheng et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(98)00004-8); [Tobin et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00004-8)) though suppression of FSHβ mRNA transcription (see [Miller et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00004-8)), an effect that is enhanced by inhibin in vivo (ram: [Tilbrook et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(01)00004-8); ewe: [Martin et al., 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(88)90004-8)). Thus inhibin, by blocking activin action, and estradiol and testosterone by direct effects suppressing FSH production and secretion through alterations in FSHβ gene regulate FSH secretion by direct actions at the pituitary gonadotrope, effects that cannot be overcome by GnRH.

### 8.3. GnRH and the pathways of LH and FSH secretion

The close association between the level of FSHβ mRNA, and the low amounts of FSH stored in the pituitary and the plasma concentrations of FSH are classic of a hormone released through a constitutive pathway where release is dependent on rate of synthesis ([McNeilly, 1988](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(88)90004-8); [Farnworth, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(95)90004-8); [McNeilly et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00004-8)). In contrast the major pathway for LH release is GnRH-induced release of stored hormone, with little relationship between the amount of LH stored, LHβ mRNA levels, and plasma concentrations of LH. While LH and FSH are present within the same gonadotropes, only a small percent of gonadotropes (around 20%) express large amounts of GnRH receptor or release LH in response to GnRH ([Neill et al., 1987](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(87)90004-8); [McNeilly et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(03)00004-8)). How many cells release FSH is unknown. Furthermore, recent studies in sheep have confirmed that LH is stored in electron-dense granules within the gonadotrope ([Currie and McNeilly, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(95)90004-8)) associated with the storage protein secretogranin II ([Crawford and McNeilly, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00004-8); [Crawford et al., 2002, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(02)00004-8)), and the presence of these granules is essential for GnRH-induced pulsatile secretion of LH ([Crawford et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0378-7753(00)00004-8)). LH granules appear to polarise to the cell membrane abutting a capillary in approximately 20% of gondotropes during the oestrous cycle, with the number increasing dramatically during the preovulatory LH surge ([Currie and McNeilly](https://doi.org/10.1016/0378-7753(95)90004-8)).

1995), an effect probably induced by increased estradiol levels (Thomas and Clarke, 1997). It is presumed that the polarisation of granules occurs in gonadotropes actively secreting LH since granules in the process of exocytosis have been observed at TEM level (Currie and McNeilly, 1995; Crawford et al., 2000). Other than this movement of granules to a more releasable position in the gonadotrope, there does not appear to be any specific priming of gonadotropes to GnRH before the LH surge (Crawford et al., 2004), and no role for progesterone in amplifying the LH surge (McNeilly et al., 2003) at least in sheep. In a mouse model granules being released in response to GnRH appear to be those electron dense granule containing LH and secretogranin II, while less electron dense granules containing only LH appear to be released via a GnRH-independent constitutive pathway (Crawford et al., 2002). The cellular machinery associated with granule release, e.g. the SNAP/SNARE, and Rab3 family of proteins are all expressed in gonadotropes (Tasaka et al., 1998; Thomas et al., 1998) and should play a major role in controlling the exocytosis of LH/secretogranin II granules. What role they play, if any, in the constitutive release of LH and FSH is unclear.

In contrast FSH is not present in the LH/secretogranin II-containing electron dense granules and there is no evidence for polarisation of FSH within the gonadotrope (Thomas and Clarke, 1997; Crawford and McNeilly, 2002). Indeed after the preovulatory LH/FSH surge when there is an almost complete absence of LH granules, and no pulsatile secretion of LH, FSH secretion is increased and FSH appears in electron light dense granules, possibly associated with chromogranin A another member of the granin family of packaging proteins (Thomas and Clarke, 1997; Crawford and McNeilly, 2002; Crawford et al., 2002). Exactly why LH is directed mainly to a storage granule in association with secretogranin II, while FSH is sorted mainly to a constitutive pathway is unclear. However, since both proteins are 50% identical through sharing the common α subunit (αGSU) it is probable that the mechanism lies within the β subunit of LH, but is at present unknown. Certainly, free αGSU does not enter storage granules and is released through a constitutive pathway from bovine pituitary cells in culture (Blomquist and Baenziger, 1992). However, since both LH and FSH associate readily with granins in conditions of low pH and high calcium similar to that within the Golgi where assembly into granules occurs (Colomer et al., 1996), more work is required to establish exactly how some LH molecules form storage granules with secretogranin II while other LH molecules mimic FSH in not associating with secretogranin II and being released through the constitutive pathway. Whether GnRH plays any specific role in this delineating these pathways directly appears unlikely, only acting indirectly to affect the levels of gene expression of the LHβ, FSHβ and αGSU subunits, with minimal effects on granin expression (Nicol et al., 2002, 2004).
