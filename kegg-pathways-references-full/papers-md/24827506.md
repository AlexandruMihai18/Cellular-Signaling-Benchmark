Connections of nicotine to cancer

Sergei A. Grando

Abstract | This Opinion article discusses emerging evidence of direct contributions of nicotine to cancer onset and growth. The list of cancers reportedly connected to nicotine is expanding and presently includes small-cell and non-small-cell lung carcinomas, as well as head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, liver, colon, breast, cervical, urinary bladder and kidney cancers. The mutagenic and tumour-promoting activities of nicotine may result from its ability to damage the genome, disrupt cellular metabolic processes, and facilitate growth and spreading of transformed cells. The nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs), which are activated by nicotine, can activate several signalling pathways that can have tumorigenic effects, and these receptors might be able to be targeted for cancer therapy or prevention. There is also growing evidence that the unique genetic makeup of an individual, such as polymorphisms in genes encoding nAChR subunits, might influence the susceptibility of that individual to the pathobiological effects of nicotine. The emerging knowledge about the carcinogenic mechanisms of nicotine action should be considered during the evaluation of regulations on nicotine product manufacturing, distribution and marketing.

Along with increased consumption of products containing tobacco or nicotine, we have come to realize that nicotine itself can be genotoxic and tumour-promoting. Carcinogenesis is a continuous process that is thought to be initiated by a factor that induces a mutation, followed by other factors that stimulate the growth of the mutated cell. Tobacco smoke contains approximately 5,000 different molecules, and more than 60 of them are known carcinogens^{1,2}. In addition to nicotine, its tissue metabolite cotinine and two tobacco nitrosamines, *N*-nitrosonornicotine (NNN) and 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butane (NNK), can also have carcinogenic effects owing to binding to nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) on non-neuronal cells. NNN is formed from a reaction between nicotine and related tobacco alkaloids by nitrosation in mammals^3. Classic studies indicated that unlike NNN, NNK does not derive from tissue metabolism of nicotine^{4,5}.

The alkaloid nicotine was first isolated from the tobacco plant *Nicotiana tabacum* (*Solanaceae*) in 1828 by German chemists

Posselt and Riemann. Nowadays, nicotine-containing products are used for both recreational and medical (BOX 1) needs. One of the key trends is creating novel smokeless products using modern technologies of nicotine delivery, and some of these deliver higher doses of nicotine than cigarettes. Electronic cigarettes (eCigs) are rapidly gaining acceptance in helping people to quit smoking, reducing cigarette consumption, relieving tobacco withdrawal symptoms (for example, because of smoking restrictions) and allowing people to continue having a ‘smoking’ experience but with reduced health risks^6. However, there is uncertainty about the place of eCigs in tobacco control, and more research is needed to clearly establish their overall benefits and harms^7. Because eCigs do not burn tobacco, they do not emit smoke. Rather, the user inhales and exhales nicotine vapour. This substantially lowers environmental concentrations of tobacco carcinogens^8. However, there is no standard definition of eCigs, and different manufacturers incorporate a range of ingredients. For instance, the total level of nicotine in the inhaled vapour generated by 20 series of 15 puffs can vary from 0.5 mg to 15.4 mg. There is also very limited published data regarding the potential toxic effects of non-nicotine chemicals incorporated in eCigs, which can also include hazardous substances, as well as the known carcinogens NNN and NNK^9. As will be discussed in this Opinion article, current research provides reasons to be concerned about the safety of nicotine, be it in tobacco products, eCigs or medicines. Of particular concern are eCigs in which nicotine is heated with various undocumented ingredients, thereby increasing the potential for the generation of carcinogens.

ACh is a ubiquitous chemical in life, and it is best known for its role in neurotransmission. Increasingly, a wider role for ACh in other aspects of cell functions is being recognized. It has become evident that ACh that is locally released by non-neuronal cells can regulate tissue homeostasis in autocrine and paracrine manners through many biological effects on different cell types (reviewed in REF. 10). Knowledge is rapidly growing about non-neuronal functions of ACh that is mediated by the muscarinic and the nicotinic classes of cholinergic receptors outside of the neural system. When nAChRs were discovered on epithelial cells lining the mucocutaneous and aerodigestive epithelia, as well as on many other types of non-neuronal cells (reviewed in REF. 10), it became apparent that on its way to the ‘pleasure’ centres of the central nervous system (CNS), nicotine hits and potentially damages multiple non-neuronal targets (BOX 2). Activation of the nAChRs in non-neuronal cells can affect cell proliferation, growth arrest and apoptosis. ACh can differentially activate specific subtypes of nAChRs that are uniquely expressed by different cell types or the same cell at different stages of its differentiation, and this differential activation can lead to both growth-promoting and growth-inhibiting signals (reviewed in REF. 11). The overall cellular response to stimulation with ACh is determined by the delicate balance between these signals. A switch of the predominant nAChR subtype that is expressed on the cell membrane occurs during malignant

transformation (reviewed in REFS 12,13), which indicates that the effects of autocrine or paracrine ACh on cancer cells might differ from its effects on non-malignant cells, even if they are situated next to each other in the same tissue. This is also true for the pharmacological action of nicotine, which has a higher nAChR-binding affinity than ACh and can therefore displace ACh from nAChRs. By interfering with ACh signaling in non-neuronal tissues, nicotine produces a plethora of pathobiological effects, some of which might contribute to health problems such as cancer. For instance, it has been shown that nicotine is selectively concentrated in malignant gallbladder tissue compared with normal gallbladder tissue, which suggests an association with gallbladder cancer¹⁴. The list of cancers that may be initiated and/or promoted by nicotine is expanding and presently includes small-cell and non-small-cell lung carcinomas, as well as head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, gallbladder, liver, colon, breast, cervical, urinary bladder and kidney cancers (see REFS 14–19). Furthermore, recent data provide cumulative evidence that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes encoding nAChR subunits influence the susceptibility of individuals to lung (reviewed in REF. 18), oesophageal²⁰, gastric²¹ and cervical¹⁶ cancers (BOX 3).

This Opinion article discusses numerous mechanisms by which nicotine might contribute to the onset and expansion of cancer. The data accumulated in the literature indicate that nicotine has the ability to damage the genome, disrupt cellular metabolic processes, amplify oncogenes, inactivate tumour suppressor genes and promote a cancer-supporting microenvironment. It should be clarified that although one meta-analysis²² did not find an increased risk of oropharyngeal cancer in users of Scandinavian snus — a smokeless tobacco product that is not heated or inhaled — there are more studies showing an increased risk than those showing no risk (reviewed in REF. 23). There is also risk for cancer of the oesophagus, stomach and pancreas in snus users²³.

### Mutagenic effects of nicotine

#### The carcinogenic tissue metabolites of nicotine.
Nicotine is metabolized in the liver, primarily by the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2A6 and CYP2B6, and 70–80% of the nicotine that is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract is converted into cotinine. Cotinine shows tumour-promoting effects, as evidenced by abnormal cell proliferation, reactivation of telomerase, suppression of apoptosis, facilitated tumour growth in the Lewis lung cancer mouse model and accelerated development of lung adenomas induced by NNK in the A/J mouse strain²⁴,²⁵. Other primary metabolites include nicotine N'-oxide, nornicotine, nicotine isomethonium ion, 2-hydroxynicotine and nicotine glucuronide that apparently are not carcinogenic per se²⁶. NNN is a strong carcinogen that can induce tumours both locally and systemically (reviewed in REF. 27). It increases the proliferative potential of cells, is anti-apoptotic and promotes anchorage-independent growth and the production of tumours in nude mice, which can be abolished by nAChR antagonists²⁸,²⁹. This effect of nAChR antagonists is consistent with the ability of NNN to bind to nAChRs (reviewed in REF. 30).

#### Nicotine-induced mutagenesis.
For a very long time, it had been in doubt whether or not nicotine can induce cancer per se (reviewed in REF. 31). However, results of the recent studies demonstrating the genotoxic effect of nicotine on cultured epithelial cells³²⁻³⁴ and its tumorigenic action in A/J mice³⁵ indicate that it may. The genotoxic effects of physiological doses of nicotine were documented by the chromosome aberration test and the sister chromatid exchange assay with isolated human epithelial cells and lymphocytes³²⁻³⁴. In these studies, the genotoxic effects were triggered by the activation of cell surface nAChRs, which led to increased levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition to activating cell surface nAChRs, nicotine can also freely permeate epithelial cells and elicit its pathobiological effects owing to DNA damage by ROS that are activated through intracellular pathways³⁴,³⁶⁻⁴². However, in contrast to tobacco nitrosamines that cause KRAS and TP53 mutation⁴³, the targets of nicotine genotoxicity remain unidentified.

Despite a large number of *in vitro* studies, the tumorigenic potential of long-term systemic administration of nicotine has not been fully evaluated. In an initial proof-of-concept study, we injected A/J mice subcutaneously with the dose of nicotine lethal to 50% of animals tested (LD₅₀), 3 mg per kg, five times per week for 24 months, yielding an average dose of 2.1 mg per kg per day³⁵. This dose is approximately equal to the dose of nicotine consumed by a regular Scandinavian snus user, who usually receives from 60 mg to 150 mg of nicotine per day²³. Of note, an eCig cartridge filled with the ‘XXX-High Density’ nicotine solution contains 48 mg nicotine¹⁹² (on average, one eCig cartridge is consumed per day by a user). The nicotine LD₅₀ dose in humans is 6.5–13 mg per kg⁴⁴. We observed that 78.6% of experimental, but not control, A/J mice developed leiomyosarcoma or

**Box 1 | Medical use of nicotine**

Nicotine-containing products are predominantly used for smoking cessation to replace nicotine and alleviate dependence and withdrawal symptoms. Nicotine products include vaporized nicotine, nicotine gum, delayed release oral forms, nasal spray, liquid rectal enemas, transdermal patches and topical cream. Nicotine is absorbed through the skin and mucous membranes in a dose-dependent manner and has a half-life of about 2 hours¹⁶⁴. In recent years, however, the medical use of nicotine has been expanded; new uses exploit its anti-inflammatory and wound-healing-promoting effects (reviewed in REF. 165). The therapeutic effects of nicotine-containing products are best characterized in ulcerative colitis and recurrent aphthous stomatitis, both of which are epidemiologically related to smoking. It is well documented that the incidence of these diseases is lower in tobacco users and that the negative association with smoking is dose- and time-dependent¹⁶⁶⁻¹⁶⁹. Furthermore, cessation of smoking is associated with disease recurrence, which can, however, be relieved by returning to smoking. Nicotine seems to be the key mediator of these responses, because its administration inhibits the inflammation that is associated with these diseases¹⁷⁰,¹⁷¹. A similar situation is observed in patients with Behçet’s disease¹⁷²,¹⁷³ — an immune-mediated small-vessel vasculitis that manifests as mucocutaneous ulcerations — and uveitis. The anti-inflammatory effects of nicotine-containing products have been well documented in various clinical and experimental settings. For example, nicotine facilitates healing of both cutaneous¹⁷⁴⁻¹⁷⁶ and oral¹⁷¹,¹⁷³,¹⁷⁷ ulcers in humans, as well as skin blisters in rats¹⁷⁸ and excisional skin wounds in mice¹⁰⁰. Interestingly, systemic use of nicotine facilitates healing of foot ulcers in Buerger’s disease¹⁷⁴, which is common in smokers. It was therefore concluded that Buerger’s disease may be caused by something other than nicotine present in tobacco smoke and that nicotine on its own has the opposite (healing) effect. There are also anecdotal reports of the successful use of systemic or topical nicotine to treat some other mucocutaneous ulcerative diseases (for example, pyoderma gangrenosum) and inflammatory diseases of blood vessels (for example, malignant atrophic papulosis (also known as Degos disease) and erythema nodosum), subcutaneous lymph nodes (that is, Kimura’s disease) and hair follicles (eosinophilic pustular folliculitis), as well as an immune-mediated oral inflammatory disease such as lichen planus that is resistant to other treatments (reviewed in REF. 165).

rhabdomyosarcoma. Rhabdomyosarcoma can spontaneously develop in A/J mice, but leiomyosarcoma does not^{45,46}, which indicates that the leiomyosarcoma development was specific to experimental treatment. It could result from the nAChR-mediated and/or non-receptor actions of nicotine, as well as from its endogenously produced metabolites. As these mice were not treated with tobacco but were treated with pure nicotine, it is presumed that NNK could not have been present^{4,5}. Although NNN could derive from tissue metabolism of nicotine, its contribution to leiomyosarcoma development seems unlikely because although it has been documented that A/J mice exposed to NNN have more than 80% lung tumour incidence^{47}, no lung malignancy was seen in A/J mice treated with nicotine^{35}. Thus, it can be concluded that neither NNN nor NNK caused sarcomas in A/J mice treated with nicotine and that the tumorigenic action was implemented by nicotine per se. Perhaps the A/J mice developed tumours in soft tissue instead of the lung because the subcutaneous route of administration and the rapid metabolism of nicotine (~2 hours) prevented it from reaching the respiratory epithelium. Although the subcutaneous route is not used by recreational nicotine-containing products, the above results have salient implications, because they provide the first evidence for a carcinogenic potential of nicotine *in vivo*. Through its genotoxic action, nicotine could trigger malignant transformation and then facilitate growth of transformed cells via its tumour-promoting activities.

These initial studies showing nicotine-dependent chromosome aberration *in vitro* and leiomyosarcoma development in A/J mice justify further investigations of the direct mutagenic and tumorigenic actions of nicotine.

### nAChR-mediated nicotine actions

nAChRs. The nAChRs are classical representatives of a large superfamily of ligand-gated ion channel proteins. Channel opening is regulated by the binding of ACh or nicotinic agonists, such as nicotine. Nicotine-containing products can amplify signalling through nAChRs, because nicotine binds to these receptors with a higher affinity than ACh. Furthermore, the upregulation of nAChR expression by nicotine^{48} can also amplify the physiological stimulation of cells with autocrine or paracrine ACh. As cancer cells both produce ACh and express nAChRs^{49}, these receptors may be involved in tumorigenesis, even without stimulation with nicotine. The ACh-gated channels are pentamers that comprise different combinations of α1–α10, β1–β4, γ, δ and ε subunits (FIG. 1a), wherein each subunit has four putative transmembrane-spanning domains and a similar topological structure (FIG. 1b). The nAChRs are composed of ACh-binding α-subunits and ‘structural’ subunits. Each of the α7, α8 (not found in humans) and α9 subunits can form homomeric nAChR channels (hereafter referred to as α7 nAChRs or α9 nAChRs). As depicted in FIG. 1a, the heteromeric pentameric protein channels can be composed of various combinations of α1, α2, α3, α4, α5, α6, β1, β2, β3 and β4 subunits, for example, α3(β2/β4)+α5 and α9 can form a heteromeric channel with α10. The ‘muscle’-type nAChR is composed of two α1 subunits, β1, γ and δ in developing muscle, and the γ-subunit is replaced by the ε-subunit in mature muscle^{50}. Other nAChR types are also called ‘neuronal’ nAChRs because they were originally thought to be expressed exclusively by neurons. The differences in subunit composition determine the functional and pharmacological characteristics of the ion channels that are formed. For instance, the addition of α5 — an auxiliary subunit that forms functional ion channels only when it is co-expressed with both other α-subunits and β-subunits — to a doublet of α3 and either β2 or β4 modifies the pharmacological and biophysical properties of nAChR and increases Ca²⁺ permeability^{51}. Non-neuronal cells can express almost all known nAChR subunits and form functional nAChRs. Cotinine, like nicotine, can bind to and activate cellular nAChRs, such as those containing α4 and β2, α3 and β2, or α6 and β2 (REFS 52,53).

**Box 2 | The non-neuronal cholinergic system**

Acetylcholine (ACh) has emerged as a candidate regulatory molecule (‘cytotransmitter’) in numerous biological processes that are intimately connected to each other, including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, adhesion and migration of non-neuronal cells (reviewed in REF. 90). ACh is present in bacteria, blue-green algae, yeast, fungi, protozoa and primitive plants^{179}, which indicates that ACh has been functioning as a signalling molecule in non-neuronal cells for about 3 billion years, whereas its neuronal function spans only a relatively short period of about 0.5 billion years. Indeed, free ACh is found in almost all types of mammalian non-neuronal tissues at the levels equivalent to or even exceeding those in the neural system^{180}. The concentration of free ACh is a result of its synthesis by choline acetyltransferase and hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase, both of which are present in non-neuronal cells. The extracellular pool of ACh is replenished by the secretion of ACh-containing vesicles that fuse with plasma membrane and thus release free ACh, whereas the intracellular pool primarily contains free cytoplasmic ACh. The environmental, neural, endocrine and paracrine stimuli affect ACh metabolism and signalling in non-neuronal cells, which helps to adjust tissue homeostasis to a new environmental condition and sends signals back to the central nervous system and endocrine organs. It is therefore well-accepted that the non-neuronal ACh axis is an example of the more general neuroendocrine-like mechanisms that mediate peripheral responses to environmental factors and of evolutionary conservation of neuroendocrine systems in the periphery. Appreciation of these facts indicates that ACh does not operate exclusively in the neural system, as implied by the term ‘neurotransmitter’, and sets a stage for exciting discoveries of new functions of non-neuronal ACh in the physiological control of homeostasis and in human diseases.

The receptor subtypes and downstream signalling pathways vary between normal and malignant cells and depend on the cell type, current cell cycle state and environmental exposures (for example, to tobacco smoke)^{54,55}. For instance, different types of non-small-cell lung carcinoma cell lines feature unique nAChR repertoires, with some adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma lines expressing the muscle-type nAChR composed of α1, β1, δ and ε subunits and other cell lines expressing the neuronal-type α3-, α7- and α9-containing nAChRs^{56,57}. Chronic exposure of cultured human cutaneous and oral keratinocytes to either pure nicotine or tobacco extract alters the expression of nAChR subunits^{54,58–60}, which often leads to the acquisition of receptors that are characteristic of cancer cells^{55,56,61}. The number of nAChRs also has an important role, since it has been shown that cancer progression is associated with overexpression of nAChRs. In particular, nicotine upregulates expression of the α7 subunit, which leads to more α7 nAChRs; these are known to mediate many pathobiological effects of nicotine and tobacco nitrosamines (reviewed in REF. 62). Some nAChR subtypes are selectively overexpressed in various cancers, regardless of the smoking status of the person from which the sample was derived (for example, α7 nAChRs in lung cancer and α9 nAChRs in breast cancer), and inhibition of the expression of nAChR subunits (for example, α9) attenuates nicotine- or tobacco nitrosamine-induced cell proliferation *in vitro* and/or *in vivo* (reviewed in REFS 13,15).

PERSPECTIVES

Ionic signalling events triggered by opening of the nAChR channels. The ligand-gated nAChR channels mediate the influx of Na⁺ and Ca²⁺, and the efflux of K⁺. In neurons, activation of nAChRs leads to cell membrane depolarization that allows influx of Ca²⁺ through voltage-sensitive calcium channels. Although voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels also occur in non-neuronal cells such as keratinocytes⁶³, Ca²⁺ entry following nicotinergic stimulation occurs through nAChR channels, and the magnitude of Ca²⁺ influx varies among different receptor subtypes. The homomeric channels composed of α7 or α9 subunits, as well as the heteromeric nAChRs containing α9 and α10, have the greatest Ca²⁺ permeability⁶⁴,⁶⁵. The Ca²⁺ ions that enter cells through nAChRs raise the concentration of intracellular free Ca²⁺ (REF. 66). However, experiments with several types of non-neuronal cells showed that nicotinergic effects can also be elicited in the absence of Na⁺ or Ca²⁺ entry⁶⁷,⁶⁸. Therefore, the downstream signalling from nAChR expressed in non-neuronal cells apparently proceeds via both ionic and non-ionic pathways, and each type of signalling may be required to elicit specific biological responses to stimulation of the cellular nicotinergic signalling network.

Non-ionic signalling events triggered by the nAChR-coupled protein kinases. Activation of nAChRs in non-neuronal cells elicits the non-ionic signalling events that regulate protein phosphorylation and dephosphorylation, which is a novel function of nAChR subunit proteins in non-excitable cells. Experimental results revealed substantial variations of the enzymatic cascades that can be triggered owing to binding of nicotine to nAChRs expressed in non-neuronal cells. The mode of interaction of nAChRs with the signal transduction molecules varies depending on both the type of non-neuronal cell targeted by nicotine and the type of nAChR subunit involved. The nAChR-coupled signalling kinases may be activated (through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation) owing to conformational changes of nAChR subunits and/or associated proteins (FIG. 1c). The downstream signalling from nAChRs can activate phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, PI3K, AKT, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK), SRC, Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), RAC, RHO, p38 MAPK and the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway⁵⁷⁻⁶⁰,⁶⁹⁻⁷⁷. Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) may be activated owing to both ionic (that is, Ca²⁺ influx) and non-ionic (that is, liberation of intracellular Ca²⁺) signalling events. For example, activation of the α3-containing nAChR in keratinocytes can result in activation of PKC; activation of nAChR containing both α3 and α5 subunits leads to CaMKII and p38 MAPK activation; activation of α7 nAChR can activate p38 MAPK, AKT, RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and JAK2; and activation of α9-containing nAChR leads to the activation of PLC, SRC, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), PKC, RAC and RHO. Indeed, these effectors participate in signal transduction pathways downstream of other types of cell surface receptors, such as EGFR, and can therefore mediate intracellular signal crosstalk.

The nAChR proteins can physically associate with both protein kinases and protein tyrosine phosphatases in large multimeric complexes⁷⁸. For example, JAK2 binds to α7 upon stimulation of nAChR with nicotine, which leads to phosphorylation and activation of JAK2 and subsequent activation of PI3K¹⁵,⁷⁹,⁸⁰. The α7 subunit can also physically and functionally associate with SRC-family kinases⁸¹ (SFKs), whereas the subunits α3, α4, α5 and β2 show a positive interaction with the G protein subunits Gα and Gβγ⁸². Associated proteins can modulate the amplitude of nicotinergic signalling (FIG. 1c). SFKs and putative SRC-associated phosphotyrosine phosphatases (PPTPs) regulate the activity of AChRs, with SRC eliciting signalling events that emanate from nAChR and with PPTPs counteracting this effect⁸¹. Of particular interest is an observation that nicotinergic upregulation of mitogenesis through α7 nAChR involves β-arrestin-mediated activation of the SRC and RB–RAF1 pathways⁸³. However, pharmacological activation of α7 nAChRs stimulates a tyrosine phosphatase that can inactivate SRC⁸⁴, thereby leading to negative-feedback regulation. There are many other targets of nAChR-coupled signalling cascades, including transcription factors controlling gene expression (see FIG. 1d for an example), metabolic pathway components and structural components of the cytoskeleton (reviewed in REF. 85), but the exact receptor-mediated mechanisms of signal induction in each particular situation remain to be elucidated.

A study of nicotinergic regulation of α2 integrin expression in keratinocytes⁷⁷ has established a novel paradigm of α7 nAChR-mediated coordination of ionic and non-ionic signalling events. In this case, nicotine was able to simultaneously alter gene expression and induce changes in the cytoskeleton that were required for execution of a particular step in cell migration. The RAF–MEK–ERK cascade upregulating the α2 integrin was activated owing to both Ca²⁺-dependent recruitment of CaMKII and PKC, as well as Ca²⁺-independent activation of RAS. In turn, the PI3K-mediated activation of RHO-associated protein kinase (ROCK) was elicited owing to both Ca²⁺

Box 3 | Genetic predisposition to aberrant signalling through nAChRs

It has been shown that although smoking is associated with lung carcinoma in the general population, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) give an additional increased risk of lung cancer after adjustment for smoking status¹⁸¹. Classic genome-wide association (GWA) studies had shown that SNPs in the CHRNA5–CHRNA3–CHRNB4 gene cluster on the chromosome 15q25 encoding α5, α3 and β4 nAChR subunits are associated with both nicotine dependence and lung cancer¹⁸². The major limitation of the GWA studies was their focus on the SNP that is associated with nicotine addiction, which initially dampened enthusiasm for pursuing this relationship, because it was assumed that higher nicotine addiction would correlate with higher cancer rates. Later on, however, it was shown that the association of nAChR SNPs with lung cancer can be independent of smoking status¹⁸³. Furthermore, CHRNA3 SNPs were found to be associated not only with an increased risk for lung cancer but also with a poor prognosis and a larger tumour size, especially in smokers¹⁸⁴,¹⁸⁵. However, negative sex- and race- or ethnicity-dependent association with risk for lung cancer was found for certain variants in the 15q25 region, which contains CHRNA5, and in the 8p11 region, which contains the CHRNB3 and CHRNA6 genes, encoding β3 and α6 nAChR subunits, respectively¹⁸⁶,¹⁸⁷. Our case–control study revealed both positive and negative associations of CHRNA9 SNPs with the risk for lung cancer¹⁸⁸. Although the N442 α9 variant both decreased transformation of bronchial cells and was negatively associated with risk for lung cancer, the S442 α9 variant both facilitated cell transformation and was associated with an increased risk for lung cancer¹⁸⁸. The structural differences between the N442 and S442 α9 subunit variants might alter the ligand-binding abilities of the assembled of nAChR channels and influence cell response. Thus, it became apparent that some nAChR subtypes (for example, the N442 α9 variant and possibly α5-containing nAChRs¹⁸⁹) might function as tumour suppressors, whereas the others (for example, the S442 α9 variant and possibly α7 nAChR⁶²) might function as tumour promoters. The molecular mechanism affecting the susceptibility of individuals to cancer due to specific genetic variations of nAChR remains to be elucidated.

Current research indicates coupling of nAChRs to anchoring (stabilizing) and adaptor (scaffolding) proteins, as well as to protein kinases or phosphatases. The downstream signalling that regulates the phosphorylation status of signalling and structural proteins and can alter gene expression is triggered by conformational changes of nAChR subunit proteins upon binding of a ligand, such as ACh, nicotine or its congener. The upstream signalling that can alter stoichiometry, cell-membrane number, or topology, and function of nAChRs is mediated by the aforementioned nAChR-associated proteins in response to various inside-out signals. These binary systems can mediate crosstalk of nAChR with other types of cell surface receptors. d | Cooperation of the RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK and Janus kinase 2 (JAK2)–signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) pathways downstream of α7 nAChR. Stimulation of α7 nAChRs by either ACh or nicotine leads to alterations in gene expression owing to transactivation of STAT3, which occurs through two complementary downstream signalling pathways. Activation of RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK increases levels of STAT3 protein by upregulating STAT3 gene transcription, and activation of JAK2 leads to phosphorylation of STAT3, which allows subsequent translocation of STAT3 dimers to the nucleus to alter expression of other genes.

entry-dependent involvement of CaMKII and  
Ca²⁺-independent activation of JAK2. Thus,  
different signals emanating from activated  
α7 nAChRs can activate common effector  
molecules and end points. The biological  
importance of the cooperative signalling from  
α7 nAChRs that simultaneously upregulates  
α2 integrin and activates ROCK stems from  
the fact that both of these effector systems  
are crucial for the initiation of cell migration,  
which may have a role in cancer cell invasion  
of surrounding tissues and metastasis.

Regulation of gene expression through  
nAChRs. Both ionic events and non-ionic  
signalling cascades triggered by nAChRs  
can lead to changes in gene expression⁸⁶,⁸⁷.  
Classic studies with the neuron-like  
SH-SY5Y neuroblastoma cell line showed  
that the activation of nAChRs modulates  
the expression of a diverse set of genes  
that may be broadly categorized into four  
groups: transcription factors, protein processing factors, RNA-binding proteins and  
plasma membrane-associated proteins⁸⁸.

Subsequent studies with non-neuronal cells  
gave similar results, indicating that regulation  
of gene expression is a general biological  
function of nAChRs. For instance, 118 genes  
were upregulated and 97 were downregulated  
by nicotine in the human macrophage-like  
cell line U937 (REF. 89). In keratinocytes,  
the activation of nAChRs altered the expression  
of the genes encoding proteins involved  
in signal transduction, cell cycle regulation,  
apoptosis, and cell–cell and cell–substrate  
adhesion (reviewed in REFS 11, 90). The genes

that were upregulated by nicotine through α3-containing nAChRs in keratinocytes included signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1)⁵⁸, whereas those that were upregulated through α7 nAChR included STAT3 and GATA2 (REF. 60). Nicotine also upregulated the expression levels of the cell cycle and cell differentiation markers Ki67, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), p21, cyclin D1, p53, filaggrin and loricrin, which can alter the dynamic equilibrium between cell growth and maturation towards an early and excessive squamatization⁹¹.

Recent analysis of the effects of nicotine on the transcriptome of non-malignant breast epithelial cells revealed altered expression of a large number of genes involved in cellular and metabolic processes, including many genes linked to cancer⁹². In human malignant MDA-MB-231 breast cells, nicotine increased the expression of BCL-2, which is anti-apoptotic, and increased long-term cell survival via the SRC–AKT signalling pathway, revealing a regulatory network governed by the interaction of nicotine and nAChR that may integrate mitogenic signals for breast cancer development⁷⁵. In a rat model of bladder cancer, nicotine upregulated the expression of mutant p53 that was deprived of its tumour-suppressor ability⁹³. In the human colorectal cancer cell lines Caco-2 and HCT-8, nicotine increased AKT phosphorylation and the expression of PI3K, PKC, ERK1, ERK2, survivin, and BCL-2, which was mediated by activation of α7 nAChRs and associated with an increase in cell proliferation and a decrease in apoptosis⁹⁴. Intraperitoneal administration of nicotine to A/J mice with NNK-initiated lung cancer decreased survival probability and reduced the overall expression of sirtuin 1 — a tumour suppressor — in the lung⁹⁵.

Taking into consideration the tumour-promoting potential of autocrine or paracrine ACh (reviewed in REF. 96), the nicotine-induced genomic events that lead to the upregulation of nicotinic signalling pathway components are of particular interest. In human bronchioalveolar carcinoma cells, nicotine upregulated choline acetyltransferase and vesicular ACh transporter, thereby increasing production and secretion of ACh⁹⁷. These genomic effects of nicotine were mediated by α7-, α3- and β2-, and β3-containing nAChRs. In human squamous cell lung and nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, nicotine upregulated the expression of α7 (REFS 74, 98). These recent observations are in keeping with earlier reports of the nicotine-dependent modulation of nAChR expression in epithelial cells, wherein the α3-containing nAChRs are replaced by α7 nAChRs⁶⁶,⁹¹. This is not surprising, because although most cellular receptors are downregulated by agonists, chronic stimulation of nAChRs results in a paradoxical upregulation of α7, and also α5-containing nAChR channels that also contain α3 and β2 (REFS 58, 99). In keratinocytes, the transition from nAChR containing α3 and either β2 or β4 to nAChR also containing α5 predominantly involves PKC; a further transition from nAChR containing α3, β2 or β4 and α5 to the α7 nAChR involves CaMKII and p38 MAPK; and the self-upregulation of α7 nAChRs involves the p38 MAPK–AKT pathway and JAK2 (REF. 60). The transcription factor GATA2 has a key role in mediating positive-feedback-mediated upregulation of the α7 subunit. This change in nAChR subtypes progressively increases Ca²⁺ influx, which is associated with changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins that regulate cell state and function⁵⁸,⁹¹. Therefore, nicotine-dependent changes in the nAChR repertoire may be a novel pathophysiological mechanism of nicotine toxicity in non-neuronal cells.

Synergy of nicotine signalling with that of growth factors and hormones. It is well established that nicotine can accelerate wound healing by synergizing with and mimicking the effects of various growth factors¹⁰⁰–¹⁰². Nicotine can upregulate the expression of fibroblast growth factor 1 (FGF1), FGF1 receptor, FGF2 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)⁷⁴,¹⁰³–¹⁰⁸, which may help to explain some of its tumorigenic actions. Stimulation of nAChR activates the bovine FGF2 gene via signalling to induce tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, including promoter-binding factors¹⁰⁸. Accordingly, nAChR inhibition reduces FGF2 upregulation¹⁰⁹. In turn, FGF2 and insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) can alter the nAChR expression level and clustering¹¹⁰,¹¹¹, which can modify biological effects of nicotine. However, nicotine has been shown to inhibit the production and release of transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ) — in some but not all cell types¹¹²,¹¹³ — which can help tumour cells to escape from the anti-proliferative effect of this growth factor¹¹⁴. In human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells, nicotine upregulated the expression of VEGF but suppressed that of pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) — a multifunctional secreted protein that has anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and neurotrophic functions — and this led to a substantial increase of the ratio of VEGF/PEDF⁷⁴. Several studies also showed that the downstream signalling from nAChRs activated by nicotine involves phosphorylation and activation of EGFR⁷⁵,¹¹⁵, and this pathway might be involved in breast cancer development⁷⁵. However, growth factor signalling pathways can alter the composition and expression of nAChRs in a cell. For example, signalling by FGF2, insulin and IGF-I, as well as oestrogen–oestrogen receptors, alters the nAChR expression level and clustering, thereby modifying the biological effects of autocrine or paracrine ACh, as well as nicotine¹¹⁰,¹¹¹,¹¹⁶. Nicotine also upregulates the production of adrenaline, which can stimulate growth of tumour cells through its G protein-coupled receptors¹¹⁷. Taken together, these observations provide strong evidence of the synergistic action between growth factor receptors and nAChRs, which might be required to elicit the biological and tumorigenic effects of nicotine and its metabolites following their activation of nAChRs.

Tumour promotion and spreading Cancer cell survival and protection from apoptosis. It has been shown that nicotine increases the survival of cancer cells, which may depend on the p53 status of cancer cells⁹⁴,¹¹⁸,¹¹⁹. Nicotine can also increase telomerase activity via the PI3K–AKT pathway downstream of nAChRs, thereby inhibiting cell senescence and death¹²⁰. It has been documented that nicotine abolishes cancer cell apoptosis that is induced by chemotherapy and radiotherapy, which can decrease sensitivity and facilitate resistance to these therapies¹²¹–¹²⁵.

Recent research indicates that the nicotinic regulation of cell survival and death is more complex than originally thought and involves anti-apoptotic activities of nicotine that permeates cells. Functional nAChRs of both α7 and non-α7 subtypes are expressed on the mitochondrial outer membrane in non-neuronal cells, and activation of mitochondrial α7 nAChR prevents cytochrome c release, thereby blocking the initial step of intrinsic apoptosis¹²⁶,¹²⁷. The recent demonstration that the intracellular nAChRs inhibit the opening of mitochondrial permeability transition pores¹²⁸ is in keeping with earlier reports about anti-apoptotic effects of nicotine in mitochondria¹²⁹,¹³⁰. In the cytosol, nicotine is insensitive to the regulatory action of intracellular acetylcholinesterase, which functions to hydrolyse ACh in the cytosol¹³¹, and nicotine can thereby shift the equilibrium to favour the anti-apoptotic activities of mitochondrial nAChRs. Elucidation of the molecular events following activation of mitochondrial nAChRs should shed light on the mechanisms facilitating the survival of transformed cells that are exposed to nicotine.

Proliferation. It has been documented that nAChRs, particularly those of the α7 subtype, can mediate nicotine-dependent upregulation of proliferative and survival genes that contribute to the growth and progression of lung cancer cells *in vitro* and *in vivo* [74,83,132,133]. Even a short-term exposure to nicotine activates mitogenic signalling pathways involving PKC, ERK and AKT [118]. In the chick chorioallantoic membrane tumour implant model, nicotine doubled the growth rate of breast, colon and lung cancers [104]. It also increased both the numbers and the size of tobacco nitrosamine-initiated lung tumours in A/J mice [95,118]. Interestingly, exposure to NNK upregulates α7 nAChR in the lung of cancer-susceptible A/J mice, but not the C3H mouse strain, which is resistant to NNK-induced tumours [134]. An increase of nAChR numbers may allow malignant cells to bind to higher than normal amounts of autocrine or paracrine ACh (or nicotine) to facilitate their rapid growth.

Metastasis. Pharmacological stimulation of nAChRs correlates with metastatic dissemination of primary tumour cells (reviewed in REF. 13). In particular, nicotine promoted the metastasis to the liver of human pancreatic adenocarcinoma cells that were orthotopically implanted into severe-combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice [135], as well as two head and neck squamous cell carcinoma cell lines subcutaneously injected into nude mice [136]. In A/J mice, nicotine increased the growth and metastasis of NNK-induced lung tumours [61], which indicates that it can contribute to cancer progression by facilitating the outgrowth of cells with genetic damage. The pro-invasive action of nicotine may require stabilization and activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) — an oxygen-sensitive transcriptional activator — as well as synergistic cooperation of AKT and MAPK pathways [137]. Notably, *in vivo* studies showing substantially more metastasis to various distant organs in mice with orthotopically implanted pancreatic cancer cells and exposed to cigarette smoke (versus sham controls) demonstrated that metastatic cells abundantly express α7 nAChR [138]. Indeed, nicotine-dependent migration of pancreatic cancer cells *in vitro* can be regulated through α7 nAChRs [138].

The pro-metastatic activity of nicotine on cancer cells may stem from its ability to elicit the epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) — a mechanism by which cells lose their epithelial characteristics and acquire more migratory mesenchymal properties — and stimulate migration and invasion of tumour cells. In various human cancer cell lines, nicotine induced changes in gene expression that were consistent with EMT, such as reduction of the epithelial markers E-cadherin and zona occludens 1 (ZO1), and a concomitant increase in levels of the mesenchymal proteins vimentin and fibronectin [139]. Indeed, nicotine enhanced *in vitro* migration of the colon cancer cells DLD-1 and SW480 in a dose-dependent manner [140]. Overall, pro-invasive activities of nicotine in cancer are in keeping with its well-established ability to stimulate cell migration and the epithelialization stage of wound healing [100,101], which thereby provides a model of nAChR-facilitated metastasis.

The data accumulated in the literature indicate that nicotine has the ability to damage the genome, disrupt cellular metabolic processes, amplify oncogenes, inactivate tumour suppressor genes and promote a cancer-supporting microenvironment.

The process of cell migration starts with detachment of a migratory cell from neighbouring cells (scattering) followed by directional (chemotaxis) or random migration. Experiments with epidermal keratinocytes showed that the physiological control of distinct phases of cell migration is predominantly mediated by particular subtypes of nAChRs [69–71]. Signalling through α9-containing nAChRs is crucial for the initiation of cell migration [71]. Stimulation of α9-containing nAChR upregulates phosphorylation of the focal adhesion proteins focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and paxillin, as well as phosphorylation of the intercellular junction proteins β-catenin and desmoglein 3, thereby disengaging cell–cell attachment units, whereas the inhibition of α9 nAChRs interferes with phosphorylation of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins and colony scattering [71]. In *in vitro* migration assays, the stimulation of α9 nAChRs was associated with the activation of PLC, SRC, EGFR, PKC, RAC and RHO, whereas inhibition of this receptor interfered with the phosphorylation of adhesion and cytoskeletal proteins [71]. In turn, α7 nAChR directs cell chemotaxis towards the concentration gradient of an agonist such as ACh or nicotine, and this process is associated with increased expression of α2 integrin [59,69,70]. The signalling pathway of α7-dependent chemotaxis includes intracellular Ca²⁺, CaMKII, conventional isoforms of PKC, PI3K, RAC and cell division control protein 42 (CDC42) [70]. The α3β2-containing nAChR regulates random cell migration via the PKCδ and RHOA-dependent signalling cascades [70].

**Tumour-supporting environment**

Angiogenesis or neovascularization. There is overwhelming evidence that nicotine induces pathological angiogenesis that facilitates tumour survival and spreading (reviewed in REFS 141, 142). In both the Lewis lung cancer model and colon cancer xenografts in mice, nicotine enhanced tumour growth in association with an increase in tumour vascularity [143,144]. Accordingly, the α7 nAChR antagonist MG624 inhibited angiogenesis of human small-cell lung cancer cells in two *in vivo* models — the chick chorioallantoic membrane model and the nude mouse model [109]. In the chick chorioallantoic membrane model of angiogenesis, nicotine induced endothelial cell tube formation in a concentration-dependent manner, and this was blocked by an inhibitor of ERK1 and ERK2 and by antibodies to αVβ3 integrin [104]. Taken together, these observations indicate that nicotine promotes endothelial cell proliferation and migration, thereby mimicking the effect of traditional angiogenic growth factors (such as VEGF), which suggests that blockade of autocrine or paracrine nicotinic pathways could be helpful for arresting excessive tumour angiogenesis [142].

**Tissue (stromal) remodelling.** Nicotine can contribute to the tumour-promoting environment by facilitating stromal matrix reorganization and/or degradation, as well as secretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Fibroblasts are the primary cellular component of the connective tissue and seem to be a major target of nicotine, enabling nicotine to promote a pro-tumorigenic environment. Factors that are secreted by tobacco-exposed fibroblasts increased proliferation and invasiveness of immortalized but not malignant epithelial cells [145]. These effects might be mediated, at least in part, by nicotine or its metabolites activating fibroblast nAChRs, because mecamylamine — an antagonist of nAChRs — abolished nicotine-dependent upregulation of the dermal matrix proteins collagen type Ia1 and elastin, as well as matrix metalloproteinase 1 in fibroblasts [146]. Taken together, the results of experiments with cells exposed to ether whole tobacco or pure nicotine [146] suggest that nicotine can not only initiate tumour-promoting changes in epithelial cells but also promote the growth and invasion of mutant cells by creating a pro-tumorigenic stromal environment.

PERSPECTIVES

**Protection from cancer immunosurveillance.** Nicotine might allow tumour cells to overcome immunosurveillance, which might reduce cancer formation via immune-mediated clearance of transformed cells. Nicotine can inhibit antitumour immunity through various mechanisms. It has been reported that exposure to nicotine adversely affects dendritic cells, a cell type that has an important role in anticancer immunosurveillance (reviewed in REF. 147), and that this compromises host response to a foreign agent<sup>148</sup>. A general immunosuppressive effect of nicotine was shown by decreased interleukin-2 (IL-2) production in mitogen-stimulated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells<sup>149</sup>. Nicotine also increases the number of regulatory T (T<sub>Reg</sub>) cells, reduces that of T helper 17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) cells and inhibits IL-17 production in mice<sup>150,151</sup>; these changes might reduce anticancer immunosurveillance<sup>152</sup>. Most importantly, nicotine inhibits cytotoxic activity of natural killer (NK) cells<sup>153,154</sup> — the effectors of innate immunity, which are directly involved in cancer immunosurveillance (reviewed in REF. 155). For example, the NK cell-mediated lysis of Yac-1 lymphoma cells in an *in vitro* co-culture was reduced by nicotine<sup>156</sup>. The inhibitory effect of nicotine on NK cells can be abrogated by the deficiency of β2-containing nAChR<sup>154</sup>.

**Conclusions and perspectives** Nicotine can contribute to cancer in various ways through its genotoxic effects, as well as by facilitating tumour cell survival, growth, metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and creating a tumour-supporting environment, which might promote tumours that are initiated by other factors. The multiple mechanisms of nicotine carcinogenicity can result from both its nAChR-mediated and non-receptor effects. The tumour-promoting effects are apparently mediated by the nAChRs expressed on the cell membrane and mitochondria, whereas the genotoxic effects probably result from elevation of ROS levels (FIG. 2a). The receptor-mediated effects of nicotine are implemented through the synergistic ionic and non-ionic signalling events (FIG. 2b). The genotoxic effects of nicotine synergize with those of other tobacco carcinogens, and certain hormones and growth factors synergize with nicotine to induce other tumour-promoting effects. Future research should identify relative contributions of different mutagenic and tumour-promoting pathways that are activated by nicotine in various types of cancers. Therapeutic strategies that target nAChRs may restore normal physiological functions and reactivate apoptosis in malignant cells. Elucidation of the nicotinic pathways of tumorigenesis that are activated in an individual cancer patient may therefore shift the current clinical research paradigm towards the use of pharmacological inhibitors of the pathway operating in a particular individual. Pharmacological inhibition of nicotinic signalling may have applications in anticancer therapy, as silencing of the expression of nAChR subunits and treatment with nAChR antagonists produce antitumour effects both *in vitro* and *in vivo*<sup>97,157–163</sup>. Therefore, it is currently believed that nAChRs might be a novel drug target for the prevention and treatment of cancer<sup>12,13,15,62</sup>. The translational importance, however, goes beyond tobacco-related cancers, because nAChRs are also activated

**Figure 2 | Hypothetical schemes of several carcinogenic mechanisms of nicotine action.**  
*a* | The synergy of distinct carcinogenic pathways of nicotine action. The mechanism of action of nicotine comprises combined and synergistic growth-promoting and anti-apoptotic effects mediated by the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) expressed on the cell membrane and mitochondria, respectively, as well as the genotoxic action of reactive oxygen species (ROS).  
*b* | The principle pathways of downstream signalling from major nAChR subtypes that can mediate pathobiological effects of nicotine. Although components and ordering of the signalling cascades shown have been identified in a series of mechanistic studies involving human keratinocytes<sup>58,59,69–71,77,84</sup>, the same pathways are known to operate in tobacco- or nicotine-related cancers (reviewed in REFS 17, 85, 87, 191). CaMKII, Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent protein-kinase II; EGFR, epidermal growth factor receptor; JAK2, Janus kinase 2; mPTP, mitochondrial permeability transition pore; NF-κB, nuclear factor-κB; PKC, protein kinase C; PLC, phospholipase C; ROCK, RHO-associated protein kinase; STAT, signal transducer and activator of transcription.
by autocrine or paracrine ACh and thereby control the delicate balance of cell proliferation and death that separates the normal state of cells from neoplasia. The pharmacological modulation of nAChRs can affect both ion flow through the channels and activation of various kinases or signalling pathways.

Individuals who carry certain nAChR variants are at a higher risk of developing cancer. The results that show opposite effects of nAChR variants on cell growth and resistance to oncogenic transformation (BOX 3) indicate that certain SNPs in nAChRs modify the response of an individual to nicotine. The mutated receptors are constantly stimulated by physiological concentrations of autocrine or paracrine ACh, but nicotine and other chemicals that can activate nAChRs, including the tobacco carcinogen NNK, can increase aberrant signalling from these receptors, thereby facilitating neoplastic transformation. Hence, nicotine may represent a ‘second hit’ that increases the risk for survival and propagation of the transformed cells. Therefore, nicotine-containing products should be avoided by not only cancer survivors and cancer patients currently receiving chemotherapy or radiotherapy but also healthy individuals carrying these nAChR subunit SNPs. Elucidation of the specific mechanisms by which individual genetic variations of nAChRs modify predisposition to cancer development could guide personalized approaches to cancer prevention.

The emerging knowledge about a direct connection of nicotine to cancer should be considered in the development and evaluation of regulations on nicotine product manufacturing, distribution and marketing. Future studies should determine the dose- and time-dependent effects and establish whether the route of administration of nicotine (that is, skin patch versus inhalation versus oral versus enema) affects its possible carcinogenic activity. Development of sensitive *in vitro* and *in vivo* assays of mutagenic and tumour-promoting activities of nicotine should help to standardize the evaluation of different nicotine-containing products.
