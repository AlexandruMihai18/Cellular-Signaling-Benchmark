The secretion of cortisol and other steroids from adrenal tumors can be regulated by hormones other than corticotropin following the aberrant expression of several G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). To date, ectopic receptors for gastric inhibitory polypeptide, β-adrenergic receptor agonists, vasopressin (V₂ and V₃ receptors), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT₇ receptor) and, probably, angiotensin II (AT₁ receptor) have been identified. Either increased expression or altered activity of eutopic receptors for vasopressin (V₁), luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin, 5-HT (5-HT₄ receptor) and leptin might also be involved. One or more aberrant receptors can be present in unilateral tumors and bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia, at either the early subclinical or overt stages of hormone secretion. The identification of aberrant adrenal GPCRs offers the potential for novel pharmacological therapies that either suppress the endogenous ligands or block the receptor with specific antagonists.

Alteration in the activity of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been identified in several human diseases (Table 1) [1]. Often, gain-of-function disorders are secondary to dominantly transmitted missense mutations that disrupt normal inhibitory mechanisms; the receptor becomes constitutively activated in the absence of its ligand. Other GPCR mutations alter the binding-domain specificity, allowing activation by illicit ligands [2–4]. In Grave’s disease, the non-mutant thyrotropin receptor is activated by thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins. Recent studies of adrenal Cushing’s syndrome (CS) have identified a novel gain-of-function mechanism that results from aberrant adrenal expression of several GPCRs that can couple to steroidogenesis [5]. In this review, we focus on studies that examine the diversity, prevalence, potential molecular mechanisms and new pharmacotherapy of aberrant CGRPs in this disease.

Cushing’s syndrome

CS results from chronic exposure to excess glucocorticoids and other adrenocortical steroids [6]. Primary adrenal etiologies account for 15–20% of endogenous CS in adults, and are most commonly secondary to unilateral adenomas and carcinomas. Bilateral adrenal lesions occur in 10–15% of adrenal CS and include corticotropin (ACTH)-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) and primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) [6,7]. Excess production of cortisol leads to progressive feedback inhibition of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and ACTH. Several mechanisms by which cortisol is produced, despite ACTH suppression, have been identified recently. In rare cases of AIMAH, either with or without McCune-Albright syndrome, a somatic gsp mutation of Gₛα induces the constitutive activation of adenylate cyclase leading to formation of adrenocortical nodules and CS [8]. Mutations of the gene that encodes the protein kinase A (PKA) regulatory-subunit type I-A (PRKAR1A) occur in most patients with Carney complex (CNC), which leads to abnormal PKA signaling in the PPNAD and other affected tissues [7,9].

The prevalence of adrenal lesions found incidentally during abdominal imaging is ~2% in the general population, and they are most often adrenocortical adenomas secondary to adrenocortical adenomas secreting low amounts of cortisol (subclinical CS) [6,10]. Approximately 10–15% of adrenal incidentalomas are bilateral (frequently AIMAH with subclinical CS). Steroidogenesis is relatively inefficient in AIMAH, where the expression of steroidogenic enzymes is relatively decreased and heterogeneous [6,7].

Aberrant expression of GPCRs in CS

Recent work by several groups reveals that some cortisol-producing AIMAH and unilateral adenomas are regulated by the aberrant adrenal expression of either ectopic or overactive eutopic GPCRs [5,11] (Figure 1). In such cases, cortisol secretion becomes driven by a hormone that escapes cortisol-mediated feedback. Studies of the second messengers involved indicate that aberrant GPCRs regulate steroidogenesis by mimicking the cellular events that are triggered normally by the ACTH receptor [5].

Gastric inhibitory polypeptide-dependent CS

The adrenal expression of the gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GLP) receptor causes 'food-dependent' cortisol production, in which plasma cortisol levels are relatively low during fasting and increase transiently following meals [5, 12–14]. GLP-dependent CS has been identified in several countries in at least 17 patients with AIMA [5, 13–20] and in seven patients with unilateral adenoma [5, 12, 21–24]. The GLP receptor is expressed in GLP-dependent adrenal adenomas and AIMA, but not in the adrenal cortex of normal adults and fetuses, and in non-GLP-dependent adrenal CS tissues [15, 16, 22, 23, 25]. Sequence analysis of the full-length cDNA of GLP-dependent adrenals revealed no mutation in the GLP receptor [22, 25]. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the GLP receptor was found in the early stages of adrenal hyperplasia [16] and GLP stimulates cAMP production and DNA synthesis in GLP-dependent cortisol-secreting adenoma cells in primary culture [22]. The latter two findings indicate a role for ectopic GLP receptors in steroid secretion and proliferation of adrenal cells. GLP-dependent androgen secretion and hirsutism was found in an adrenal adenoma, probably resulting from the GLP-dependent clonal proliferation of a zona reticularis cell (Figure 2) [24].

Vasopressin-responsive CS

Vasopressin-responsive CS has been reported in several patients with either unilateral adenoma or AIMA who increase their secretion of cortisol with upright posture and other physiological stimuli of endogenous vasopressin [5, 26–37]. In most patients, cortisol secretion is regulated by the V₁ vasopressin receptor, which is expressed at either higher or similar levels in the adrenal tissues of vasopressin-responsive CS patients compared to normal individuals [33–37]. No mutations in V₁ receptor cDNA and promoter were found in two patients with AIMA and CS who had increased responsiveness to vasopressin [34]. In a retrospective study of 26 patients with unilateral cortisol-secreting tumors, plasma cortisol increased after testing with lysine-vasopressin in 27% of cases (five adenomas and two carcinomas) [35]. Because the V₁ receptor is normally present in the adrenal cortex and modulates modest effects on steroidogenesis in vitro, the

Luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin-dependent, serotonin-responsive CS

The luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin (LH/hCG) receptor is expressed normally in the human zona reticularis, and hCG stimulates the secretion of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) from fetal but not adult adrenal cells [41,42]. The aberrant adrenal function of the LH/hCG receptor was first identified in a French-Canadian woman with transient CS during pregnancies; persistent CS and AIMAH developed only after the post-menopausal, long-term increase of LH [43]. Administration of the long-acting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analog leuprolide acetate led to suppression of endogenous LH and normalization of cortisol production. In the same patient, cisapride and metoclopramide, which are agonists at the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT₄) receptor, also stimulated plasma cortisol but the had no effect in several other patients with AIMAH, unilateral adenoma or carcinoma and CS [32,43]. 5-HT₄ agonists are potent stimulators of aldosterone secretion in humans; they weakly increase cortisol secretion by human adrenocortical cells *in vitro*, but do not cause an increase in plasma cortisol levels in normal subjects [44].

Two Dutch women with AIMAH and CS had combined aberrant responses to GnRH, LH, hCG, cisapride and metoclopramide [45]. Although mRNA encoding the LH/hCG receptor was slightly higher in AIMAH than in normal adrenals, the 5-HT₄ receptor was not studied. A woman with CS and aberrant adrenal LH/hCG receptor was also found to have a *gsp* mutation of Gₛα in her unilateral adenoma [46]. In another woman with AIMAH and CS with aberrant responses to GnRH, hCG and LH, suppression of endogenous LH with leuprolide acetate only partially improved hypercortisolism. This indicates the presence of either other, unidentified, aberrant receptors or another mechanism that regulates cortisol secretion [47]; the LH/hCG receptor was expressed in the adrenal but there was no mutation in Gₛα.

The 5-HT₄ receptor was overexpressed in four out of six patients with CS and aberrant responses to either cisapride or metoclopramide; in the two patients with normal levels of 5-HT₄ receptors, there were no differences in either splice variants or in the cDNA sequence of the receptor [48]. An Italian group also found increased adrenal expression of 5-HT₄ receptor transcripts in a patient with AIMAH and cisapride-responsive CS [49]. A female AIMAH patient had predominant hyperaldosteronism and cyclical CS with an aberrant cortisol response to 5-HT₄ agonists [50]. A 59-year-old virilized woman with androgen-secreting AIMAH regulated by hCG expressed the LH/hCGR in one resected adrenal; suppressing endogenous LH with leuprolide acetate normalized androgen secretion from the contralateral adrenal and avoided bilateral adrenalectomy [51]. In these cases, the exaggerated cortisol responses to either LH/hCG or cisapride/metoclopramide appears to be secondary to either the increased expression of LH/hCG and 5-HT₄ receptors in the zona fasciculata or abnormal function of these ‘ectopic’ receptor-effector systems (Figure 1). More recently, ectopic expression of the 5-HT₇ receptor was identified in patients with 5-HT-responsive AIMAH and CS [36].

Figure 1. Regulation of steroidogenesis by aberrant hormone receptors in fasciculata cells of adrenal Cushing’s syndrome (CS). ACTH (corticotropic) is the physiological modulator of steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex. Binding to its receptor (ACTHR) activates adenyl cyclase (AC) and leads to cAMP production with cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) activation and phosphorylation of specific transcription factors, which regulate free cholesterol availability and steroidogenic enzymes expression. The ectopic expression of GPCR functionally coupled to steroidogenesis confers inappropriate sensitivity of adrenocortical cells either to GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide), to catecholamines (E, NE) or to other hormones (angiotensin-II, glucagon, serotonin 5HT₇, thyrotropin, V₂-vasopressin, etc.). These ectopic receptors probably regulate steroidogenesis in adrenal CS by mimicking the cellular events triggered by ACTH receptor activation. In other cases, increased expression or activity of eutopic receptors, such as those for vasopressin (V₁-vasopressin or V₁R), for luteinizing hormone and human chorionic gonadotropin (LH/hCG), or for serotonin (5-HT₄) induces steroidogenesis through cAMP or other signaling mechanisms.

exaggerated steroidogenic responses to vasopressin is secondary to the increased activity and/or expression of a ‘eutopic’ receptor-effector system [5,27,33–35]. Recently, ectopic expression of V₂ and V₃ receptors has been reported *in vitro* in some cases of AIMAH, but the effect of dDAVP, a preferential agonist of V₂ receptors, has not been studied *in vivo* [33,36,37].

Catecholamine-dependent CS

The aberrant adrenal expression of β-adrenergic receptors has been identified in four patients with AIMAH and CS who increased their plasma cortisol and aldosterone levels when endogenous catecholamines increased (upright posture, insulin-induced hypoglycemia and exercise) [32,38–40]. Isoproterenol infusion stimulated cortisol and aldosterone secretion in these patients, but not in normal subjects. High-affinity binding sites compatible with either β₁- or β₂-adrenergic receptors were coupled efficiently to steroidogenesis in the adrenal tissues of such patients, but not in controls, which indicates the ectopic nature of this receptor [5,38]. The presence of both β-adrenergic receptors and V₁ receptors was identified in the adrenals of two women with AIMAH [32,39]; it was shown that fluctuations in endogenous, physiological levels of vasopressin (water and hypertonic Na⁺ loading) resulted in parallel changes in plasma cortisol levels.

Figure 2. Phenotypic adrenocortical expression of an ectopic GIP receptor. The ectopic expression of the GIP receptor following a somatic mutation in a zona fasciculata cell in the post-natal adrenal cortex will induce its clonal expansion; this will result in GIP-dependent cortisol-secreting adrenal adenoma and food-dependent Cushing's syndrome. When the initial somatic mutation occurs in a cell from the zona reticularis, the phenotype becomes a GIP-dependent adrenal androgen-secreting adenoma. Finally, if the mutation developed in a zona glomerulosa cell, a GIP-dependent aldosteronoma would develop. If the mutation occurred during early embryogenesis in adrenal stem cells or from germline genetic transmission, bilateral macronodular adrenal hyperplasia with variable secretion of cortisol and other adrenal steroids would be present.

### Angiotensin-responsive CS

Vasopressin had no effect on steroidogenesis in a patient with CS, AIMAH and a large increase in plasma aldosterone and cortisol levels during upright posture [52]. Short-term, oral administration of the angiotensin (AT₁) receptor antagonist candesartan completely inhibited the elevation in cortisol and aldosterone. Chronic treatment of the patient with AT₁ receptor antagonists was not attempted and no demonstration *in vitro* of the presence of the AT₁ receptor has been provided. *In vitro* stimulation of cortisol secretion by angiotensin II also occurred in patients with AIMAH and CS who had increases in cortisol levels with upright posture [53].

### Systematic screening for the presence of aberrant hormone receptors

Investigation protocols have been developed to systematically evaluate patients with adrenal CS for the presence of aberrant adrenal-hormone receptors [5, 32, 54–56, 58]. The strategy is to modulate the levels of ligands for the potential aberrant receptors using physiological (upright posture and mixed meals) and pharmacological (gonadotropin-releasing hormone, thyrotropin-releasing hormone, vasopressin, glucagon and metoclopramide) tests, and to examine whether cortisol and other steroids levels are modified. In a systematic clinical screening of 20 consecutive patients with adrenal CS, all six patients with AIMAH had at least one aberrant receptor (two patients with abnormal GIP receptors, one with abnormal LH/hCG and 5-HT₄ receptors, one with an abnormal β-adrenergic receptors, one with an abnormal V₁-vasopressin receptor, and one with abnormal β-adrenergic receptors and V₁ receptors) [32]; only three out of 13 patients with unilateral adenoma had aberrant responses, and responses were normal in the one patient with adrenal carcinoma. The French multicentre group COMEt also studied 11 patients with AIMAH and two with bilateral adenomas [55]. No aberrant responses were found in the latter. However, all 11 AIMAH patients had aberrant cortisol responses to at least one, frequently to several, stimuli (eight to upright posture, two out of four to lysine-vasopressin, four out of ten to combined GnRH/thyrotropin-releasing hormone, six out of ten to either cisapride or metoclopramide, and two to food combined with LH/hCG response). In a French multicentre *in vitro* study, the GIP receptor was detected in one out of 16 unilateral

adenomas, none of 14 carcinomas, and four out of eight AIMAH [20].

The expression of aberrant receptors also occurred in all four patients with incidentally found AIMAH and subclinical CS: two had combined V₁ receptor, LH/hCG receptor and 5-HT₄ receptor abnormalities; one had combined V₁ receptor and 5-HT₄ receptor abnormalities; and one had an aberrant V₁ receptor [56]. Similarly, a Japanese group found aberrant responses to vasopressin *in vivo* and increased V₁ receptor expression in adrenal tissues of five patients with AIMAH and subclinical CS [57]. In a prospective, multicentre, French study of 21 patients with unilateral adrenal adenoma and either subclinical or mild CS, all had at least one aberrant cortisol response and 86% had subclinical CS and multiple aberrant responses. The most frequent of these were to terlipressin (V₁ receptor, 90%) and cisapride (5-HT₄ receptor, 81%). Interestingly, four out of 21 had a response to exogenous glucagon (first report), four out of 21 to a mixed meal, and three out of eight to infusion of angiotensin II [58].

Based on current studies, we recommend that all patients with AIMAH and clinical CS undergo screening for aberrant receptors because this might change the therapeutic strategy (see later). For patients with unilateral lesions and CS, and for those with subclinical diseases, the screening for aberrant receptors should be conducted in the context of clinical-research projects.

### Familial AIMAH

Initially, most cases of AIMAH appeared to be sporadic, but systematic family screening was not performed [7]. There are now six reports of familial cases of AIMAH that indicate autosomal-dominant transmission [37,59–63]. Aberrant V₁ receptors and β-adrenergic receptors were identified in one family [61], β-adrenergic receptors in another [63], and V₁, V₂, and V₃ receptors in a third family [37]. Aberrant receptors have not been studied in other families.

### Other aberrant hormone receptors

Several studies *in vitro* further support the expression of GPCRs in benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors in humans; these include receptors for thyrotropin, follicle stimulating hormone and interleukin 1, in addition to those confirmed *in vivo* [5,64]. In a woman with GIP-dependent AIMAH, leptin was also found to stimulate cortisol secretion *in vitro* [17]. In a patient with AIMAH and CS without aberrant hormone responses, there was an increase in the adrenal expression of pro-opiomelanocortin/ACTH [65]. In PPNAD, either with or without CNC, the paradoxically increased secretion of cortisol following administration of dexamethasone is not associated with aberrant GPCRs, but with overexpression of glucocorticoid receptors in the micronodules [66].

### Molecular mechanisms of aberrant hormone receptors

The hormonal regulation of the development and function of the adrenal cortex requires tissue-specific expression of the appropriate hormone receptors. This implies the existence of regulatory mechanisms that involve cis-acting regulatory elements (promoters) and trans-acting factors (transcription factors, co-activators and corepressors) for these receptors. The GIP receptor is the best characterized ectopic receptor in adrenal CS so we first examined whether mutations in its promoter might explain aberrant tissue expression. No mutations and polymorphisms in the regulatory region of the gene that encodes the GIP receptor were identified in GIP-dependent CS [67]. Because several aberrant receptors can be present in the same adrenal, mutations in trans-acting factors that are common to these receptors might be more likely. Analysis of the 5′ flanking region of the human GIP receptor gene revealed several GC-rich boxes without either TATA or CAAT boxes; members of the Sp family of transcription factors were shown to bind to several of these sites and to regulate the expression of this receptor [68]. Further studies are necessary to identify other tissue-specific transcription factors that are involved in regulating the expression of the gene that encodes the GIP receptor in humans, and mutations that might result in ectopic adrenal expression of GIP receptors in GIP-dependent CS.

Using large-scale, cDNA-microarray analysis, the gene-expression profile of eight AIMAH tissues (including three GIP-dependent) was compared to normal adrenal glands. 82 and 31 genes were found to be upregulated and downregulated, respectively. The former included regulators of transcription, cell cycle and cell adhesion [69]. Sequences that were downregulated include genes that encode enzymes involved in adrenal steroidogenesis. This study has revealed potential new mediators of adrenocortical hyperplasia and/or aberrant expression of hormone receptors that require further investigation.

Another interesting hypothesis emerges from the study of transgenic mice that express a chimeric protein that consists of fragments of the β-subunit of bovine LH and hCG (bLHB-CTP) in their pituitary. These mice develop adrenal CS, polycystic ovaries and ovarian tumors following chronic elevations in serum LH levels [70], which results from ectopic expression of LH/CG receptors in the adrenal cortex. Because this induction is abolished by gonadectomy, it is proposed that elevated estrogen and prolactin levels are responsible for inducing the illicit adrenal expression of the LH/CG receptor.

The presence of aberrant receptors in unilateral lesions might arise from a monoclonal somatic mutation. To involve the whole adrenal cortex in patients with AIMAH, the mutation must occur either in the germline or somatically at an early stage of embryogenesis. One can postulate that the primary event is a mutation that results in aberrant adrenal expression of aberrant receptors, leading to increased proliferation and, eventually, increased hormone production. Alternatively, the primary event might be an unknown, proliferative event that leads to cell dedifferentiation and the resultant expression of either one or several genes that encode hormone receptors. Our hypothesis is that the aberrant adrenocortical expression of a receptor is a primary phenomenon that initiates bilateral diffuse hyperplasias and CS.

Figure 3. Hypothesis of sequential genetic events leading to AIMAH. The initial event is the aberrant expression of the luteinizing hormone/human chorionic gonadotropin receptor (LH/hCGR) in the adrenal cortex during early embryonic life. Upon stimulation of this receptor, as during pregnancy (activation by hCG), diffuse adrenal hyperplasia (polyclonal) and transient CS occurs; but this is still reversible when hCG and LH levels are reduced following delivery. After menopause, the constant elevation of LH causes diffuse hyperplasia and CS. Other unidentified (second, third) somatic events occur progressively with time in a small number of cells; the monoclonal proliferation of these cells leads to appearance of several nodules which have maintained the expression of aberrant LH/hCG receptor. The inhibition of LH levels is able to control the excess production of steroids; this might be able to induce regression of adrenal growth at the stage of hyperplasia, but it might become insufficient to cause tumor regression when other oncogenic events have provided additional growth advantage to these cells.

chronic elevation of LH at the menopause supports this hypothesis. In addition to the aberrant receptor, which initiates hyperplasia, other somatic, genetic events occur later, as demonstrated by microarray data [69], which generates diverse, monoclonal nodule formation and the AIMAH phenotype (Figure 3).

An opportunity for new pharmacological therapies

The identification of aberrant adrenal hormone receptors in cortisol-secreting hyperplasias and tumors provides new opportunities for specific pharmacological therapies as alternatives to adrenalectomy. Pharmacological blockade of the postprandial release of GIP with octreotide leads to the clinical and biological improvement of CS. However, this does not persist in the long-term, probably because of the desensitization of somatostatin receptors in GIP-secreting duodenal K cells [5,14,21]. In catecholamine-dependent CS and AIMAH, β-adrenergic receptor antagonists are efficient in the long-term control of hypercortisolism [38,40]. This does not result in hyperplasia regression, but only partial receptor blockade was maintained because more complete blockade caused cortisol deficiency. In LH/hCG-dependent AIMAH and CS, the suppression of endogenous LH levels with long-acting leuprolide acetate controls steroid secretion and avoids bilateral adrenalectomy [43,51]. It is possible that tumor regression might not occur, despite complete blockade of aberrant receptors, because other genetic events that induce proliferative (in addition to the aberrant receptors) might accumulate over time (Figure 3).

Conclusions

In recent years, it has become recognized that evaluation in vivo of patients with either ACTH-independent unilateral tumors or AIMAH can identify one or several

aberrant GPCRs that regulate steroid hormone secretion in CS. Further studies are likely to identify more hormone receptor abnormalities and should, eventually, allow the use of pharmacological tools that either inhibit the production of endogenous ligands or specifically antagonize the aberrant receptors. Because the presence of aberrant hormone receptors can be detected at the stage of subclinical steroid hormone production [56–58] and in the context of familial AIMAH screening [37,59–63], it will be interesting to investigate whether the evolution of adrenal tumors and hyperplasias is modified by these new pharmacological approaches. The molecular mechanisms that lead to the aberrant expression of CGRPs and their role in tumor growth remain to be elucidated. Further studies will probably identify more aberrant GPCRs in adrenal tumors, and in other endocrine and non-endocrine tissues.

**AGORA initiative provides free agriculture journals to developing countries**

The Health Internetwork Access to Research Initiative (HINARI) of the WHO has launched a new community scheme with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization.

As part of this enterprise, Elsevier has given 185 journals to Access to Global Online Research in Agriculture (AGORA). More than 100 institutions are now registered for the scheme, which aims to provide developing countries with free access to vital research that will ultimately help increase crop yields and encourage agricultural self-sufficiency.

According to the Africa University in Zimbabwe, AGORA has been welcomed by both students and staff. ‘It has brought a wealth of information to our fingertips’ says Vimbai Hungwe. ‘The information made available goes a long way in helping the learning, teaching and research activities within the University. Given the economic hardships we are going through, it couldn’t have come at a better time.’
