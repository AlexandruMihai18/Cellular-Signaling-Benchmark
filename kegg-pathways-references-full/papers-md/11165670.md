Rho–Rho-kinase pathway in smooth muscle contraction and cytoskeletal reorganization of non-muscle cells

Yuko Fukata, Mutsuki Amano and Kozo Kaibuchi

Hypercontraction or abnormal contraction of vascular smooth muscle is a major cause of diseases such as hypertension and vasospasm of the coronary and cerebral arteries. A better understanding of the mechanism of regulation of smooth muscle contraction should lead to improved treatments for such diseases. Recent studies have revealed important roles for the small GTPase Rho and its effector, Rho-associated kinase (Rho kinase) in Ca²⁺-independent regulation of smooth muscle contraction. The Rho–Rho-kinase pathway modulates the level of phosphorylation of the myosin light chain of myosin II, mainly through inhibition of myosin phosphatase, and contributes to agonist-induced Ca²⁺-sensitization in smooth muscle contraction. Rho–Rho-kinase mechanisms also participate in a variety of the cellular functions of non-muscle cells, such as stress-fibre formation, cytokinesis and cell migration. This review summarizes the role of the Rho–Rho-kinase pathway in contractile processes of smooth muscle and in non-muscle cell functions, and the pathophysiological implications of this pathway.

A rise in the concentration of cytoplasmic free Ca²⁺ is the major trigger for contraction in both smooth muscle and striated muscle¹. However, contraction in smooth muscle, unlike that in striated muscle, is regulated to a large extent by a membrane-potential-independent mechanism, in which agonists induce contraction without depolarizing the membrane² (Fig. 1). Agonists such as 5-HT and phenylephrine activate the phosphatidylinositol cascade to cause an increase in Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The resultant increase in intracellular Ca²⁺{[Ca²⁺]i} enhances the binding of Ca²⁺ to calmodulin (CaM). A Ca²⁺–CaM complex activates myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) to phosphorylate the myosin light chain (MLC) of myosin II (Refs 3–5). It is widely accepted that the degree of MLC phosphorylation is the essential factor that determines the extent to which smooth muscle contracts: MLC phosphorylation promotes smooth muscle contraction whereas MLC dephosphorylation, following a reduction in [Ca²⁺]i, results in muscle relaxation (Fig. 1).

However, using Ca²⁺ indicators to measure [Ca²⁺]i, it has been revealed that the Ca²⁺ concentration does not always parallel the degree of MLC phosphorylation and contraction. The extent of MLC phosphorylation or force of contraction induced by agonist stimulation is higher than that caused by a depolarization-induced increase in the Ca²⁺ concentration, the so-called Ca²⁺-sensitization². Thus, an additional important mechanism of regulation that can modify the levels of MLC phosphorylation and degree of contraction independently of Ca²⁺ concentration has been proposed (Fig. 1). Subsequent studies have revealed that a GTP-binding protein is involved in agonist-mediated Ca²⁺-sensitization²,⁶. More importantly, it is understood that the increased MLC phosphorylation via a GTP-binding protein is due to the inhibition of myosin phosphatase, rather than activation of MLCK (Refs 2,7) (Fig. 1).

The small GTPase Rho, a member of the Rho subfamily of the Ras superfamily of monomeric GTPases, is responsible for the Ca²⁺-sensitization induced by agonist stimulation⁸,⁹ and is thought to act by inhibiting myosin phosphatase activity¹⁰. Until recently, the molecular mechanism by which Rho regulates smooth muscle contraction was largely unknown. However, the signalling pathway that involves the downstream effector of Rho, Rho-associated kinase (Rho-kinase), has been shown to play a crucial role in the Ca²⁺-sensitization of smooth muscle contraction. Further analyses using inhibitory probes specific for Rho-kinase have revealed that Rho-kinase-mediated Ca²⁺-sensitization is involved in diseases such as hypertension and coronary artery spasm, which suggests that Rho-kinase could be a therapeutic target for these diseases¹¹⁻¹³.

Regulation of Rho activity

At least ten members of the Rho family of GTPases are present in mammals: Rho (isoforms A–E, and G), Rac (isoforms 1 and 2), Cdc42 and TC10. Rho, Rac1 and Cdc42 have been the most intensively characterized¹⁴. The effector domains of RhoA, RhoB and RhoC (collectively referred to here as Rho) have the same amino acid sequence, and these GTPases appear to have similar cellular functions. Most of the functions of Rho described below are based on studies of RhoA. Like other GTP-binding proteins, Rho exhibits both GDP/GTP-binding activity and GTPase activity, and functions as a molecular switch, cycling between a GDP-bound inactive state (GDP–Rho) and a GTP-bound active state (GTP–Rho)¹⁴. The activity of Rho is cyclically regulated. Thus, in resting cells, RhoGDP dissociation inhibitor (Rho GDI) binds to GDP–Rho and extracts GDP–Rho from the

Rho-kinase and the myosin-binding subunit: specific effectors of Rho

Rho is involved in the regulation of stress-fibre and focal-adhesion formation, cell morphology, cell aggregation, cadherin-mediated cell-cell adhesion, cell motility, cytokinesis, membrane ruffling, neurite retraction, microvilli formation and smooth muscle contraction^{18-20}. Several proteins have been identified as effectors of Rho, including protein kinase N [PKN (PRK1)], Rho-kinase, the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase, rhophilin, rhotekin, citron, p140mDia and citron kinase^{18-20}. Rho-kinase and MBS are involved in smooth muscle contraction downstream of Rho, and their details are summarized below. (More information about other Rho effectors can be found elsewhere^{18,20}.)

### Rho-kinase

Rho-kinase is a Ser/Thr protein kinase that was identified as a GTP-Rho-binding protein from bovine brain by affinity column chromatography on matrix-bound GTP-Rho (Ref. 21). Rho-kinase was also identified as ROKα (Ref. 22) and ROCK2 (Ref. 23). ROKβ (also known as ROCK1)^{22,24} is an isoform of Rho-kinase (ROKα/ROCK2). Hereafter, both Rho-kinase/ROKα/ROCK2 and ROKβ/ROCK1 are referred to as Rho-kinase. Rho-kinase has a kinase domain in its N-terminal domain, a coiled-coil domain in its middle portion, and a putative pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain in its C-terminal domain that is split by the insertion of a Cys-rich region. The kinase domain of Rho-kinase has 72% amino acid sequence homology with the kinase domain of myotonic dystrophy kinase^{21}. The Rho-binding (RB) domain of Rho-kinase is localized in the C-terminal portion of the coiled-coil domain^{21}, and Rho-kinase activity is enhanced by binding GTP-Rho. The lack of the C-terminal portion in Rho-kinase, either PH or PH and coiled-coil domains, makes Rho-kinase constitutively active^{25-27}. By contrast, the kinase-activity-deficient form or the C-terminal fragments that lack the kinase domain serve as the dominant-negative form of Rho-kinase in cells^{25-30}. The C-terminal fragment of Rho-kinase that contains the RB domain, deficient in Rho-binding activity following point mutations, and the PH domain [here referred to as RB/PH (TT)] serves as the dominant-negative form that specifically inhibits Rho-kinase^{27,28}. In addition to these dominant-negative fragments of Rho-kinase, several compounds such as Y27632 and fasudil have been developed and reported to inhibit the kinase activity of Rho-kinase specifically in a manner competitive with ATP. These inhibitory probes for Rho-kinase are very useful for evaluating Rho-kinase functions in cells.

### Myosin-binding subunit of myosin phosphatase

Myosin phosphatase, which is physiologically responsible for the dephosphorylation of the MLC of myosin II, comprises three subunits: a 37-kDa type 1

http://tips.trends.com

phosphatase catalytic subunit, a 130-kDa MBS, also  
called myosin phosphatase target subunit (MYPT),  
and a 20-kDa subunit, whose function is not yet  
known<sup>31</sup>. Myosin phosphatase binds to the  
phosphorylated MLC via MBS and dephosphorylates  
MLC. The C-terminal domain of MBS interacts with  
GTP-bound Rho (Ref. 32). The interaction of  
GTP-Rho with MBS was found to have no effect on  
the myosin phosphatase activity<sup>32</sup>, so the exact  
relevance of the interaction remains to be clarified.  
MBS was also identified as a substrate of Rho-kinase<sup>21</sup>;  
activated Rho-kinase phosphorylates MBS and  
thereby inhibits the myosin phosphatase activity  
in vitro<sup>32</sup>. Rho-kinase and MBS are therefore believed  
to regulate the level of MLC phosphorylation  
cooperatively, and this regulatory mechanism plays  
important roles in a variety of cellular functions,  
particularly in smooth muscle contraction.

Rho-Rho-kinase pathway in smooth muscle  
Rho and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization  
The role of Rho in agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization  
in smooth muscle has been elucidated. Thus, the  
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitizing effect of agonists or GTPγS (a non-  
hydrolysable GTP analogue) are blocked completely  
by inhibitory toxins specific for Rho, such as  
Clostridium botulinum C3 and Staphylococcal  
toxin EDIN (epidermal differentiation inhibitor)<sup>8,9</sup>,  
and the introduction of GTPγS-Rho or the  
constitutively active form of Rho into permeabilized  
smooth muscle cells induces Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization<sup>8,9</sup>.  
Furthermore, the increase in the MLC  
phosphorylation by the activated Rho at a constant  
Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is thought to result from a  
reduction in the dephosphorylation rate and not an  
increase in the phosphorylation rate<sup>10</sup>. Thus, Rho  
supposedly regulates the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitivity via the  
regulation of myosin phosphatase activity (Fig. 2).

Regulation of smooth muscle contraction by  
Rho-Rho-kinase pathway  
How does Rho mediate the inhibition of myosin  
phosphatase activity during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization of  
smooth muscle? The identification and functional  
analyses of Rho effectors shed light on the signalling  
pathway that links Rho to the regulation of the  
myosin phosphatase activity, namely, of the MLC  
phosphorylation level (Fig. 2). Agonists activate Rho  
through the activation of certain heterotrimeric  
G-protein-coupled receptors, and the activated Rho  
interacts with Rho-kinase, leading to its activation.  
The activated Rho-kinase subsequently  
phosphorylates MBS and inhibits the activity of  
myosin phosphatase<sup>32</sup>. Concomitantly, Rho-kinase  
phosphorylates MLC directly at the same site that is  
phosphorylated by MLCK (Ref. 33). The addition of  
the constitutively active Rho-kinase to extensively  
permeabilized smooth muscle cells evokes muscle  
contraction through MLC phosphorylation, which is  
insensitive to the MLCK inhibitor wortmannin<sup>34</sup>.

Thus, Rho-kinase could regulate the phosphorylation  
of MLC and contraction via the two processes  
(i.e. inactivation of myosin phosphatase and direct  
MLC phosphorylation). However, recent studies have  
shown that it is the Rho-kinase-mediated inactivation  
of myosin phosphatase, rather than the direct  
phosphorylation of MLC by Rho-kinase, that could be  
responsible for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization of smooth muscle<sup>35</sup>.  
Elucidation of the precise physiological contribution  
of the two processes to in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization could  
have important therapeutic implications.

The availability of specific Rho-kinase inhibitors,  
such as Y27632 and fasudil, has enabled the  
evaluation of the physiological roles of Rho-kinase in  
intact smooth muscle. Y27632 contains a pyridine  
moiety and was originally developed as a relaxant of  
vascular smooth muscle<sup>11</sup>. This compound completely  
inhibits agonist-induced contraction of vascular and  
bronchial smooth muscle by selectively inhibiting the  
Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitizing mechanism<sup>11</sup>. These results clearly  
indicate that Rho-kinase is a major effector involved  
in agonist-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization in smooth  
muscle cells (Fig. 2).

As described above, the major mechanism  
underlying Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization of smooth muscle is  
phosphorylation of MBS and consequent inhibition of  
myosin phosphatase activity by Rho-kinase. Recently,  
the mechanism of the inhibition has been  
investigated. The major sites of phosphorylation of  
MBS by Rho-kinase have been identified as  
Thr695/697, Ser849/854 and Thr850/855 (in chicken  
M133 MBS isoform / rat3 MBS isoform)<sup>36,37</sup>. Because  
the substitution of Thr695/697 by Ala completely  
abolishes the inhibitory effect of Rho-kinase on the  
myosin phosphatase activity in vitro, the major site  
involved in inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity  
is thought to be Thr695/697 (Ref. 36). It had been  
previously reported that an endogenous kinase  
co-purified with MBS from chicken gizzard  
phosphorylated MBS at Thr695/697 and thereby  
inactivated the myosin phosphatase activity<sup>31,36</sup>.  
However, this endogenous kinase is supposedly  
distinct from Rho-kinase, judging from data reported  
independently<sup>28,33,38</sup>; different sensitivities to kinase  
inhibitors such as H7 and different sites of  
phosphorylation in MLC by each kinase, and its  
physiological contribution to in vivo Ca<sup>2+</sup>-  
sensitization, remain to be elucidated. The relevance  
of the phosphorylation at Ser849/854 and Thr850/855  
on myosin phosphatase activity has not been  
evaluated. However, site Ser849/854 is specifically  
phosphorylated by Rho-kinase. By using an antibody  
that specifically recognizes the phosphorylation state  
of Ser849/854 in MBS, the Rho-Rho-kinase activation  
and the possible implication of the inhibition of  
myosin phosphatase could be evaluated directly in  
cells<sup>37</sup> (see below).

In addition to GTP-binding proteins, arachidonic  
acid and protein kinase C (PKC) might also be  
mediators of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitization in smooth muscle

Fig. 2. Established and proposed models for the regulation of smooth muscle contraction. The mechanisms by which contraction of smooth muscle is modulated independently of Ca²⁺ are shown. Agonists that lead to the Gq-coupled increase in the Ca²⁺ concentration and sequential activation of myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (indicated by thin arrows) also activate Rho, presumably through the simultaneous coupling of the receptors to G12/13 and activation of GEFs. The activated Rho (Rho-GTP) activates Rho-kinase, which then phosphorylates the myosin-binding subunit (MBS) of myosin phosphatase and so inhibits the myosin phosphatase (MP) activity (indicated by thick arrows). Rho-kinase also phosphorylates myosin light chain (MLC) directly. As a result, the increased phosphorylation of MLC (red arrow) causes more contraction. The activation of Rho-kinase is also mediated by arachidonic acid (AA) under the stimulation of agonists. Furthermore, Rho-kinase phosphorylates and activates CPI-17, a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitor of myosin phosphatase. These ancillary pathways together mediate the inhibition of the myosin phosphatase activity and could be involved in an increase in MLC phosphorylation. Y27632 is shown as a representative of inhibitory probes that specifically inhibit Rho-kinase. Abbreviations: CaM, calmodulin; cat, catalytic subunit of myosin phosphatase; GEFs, guanine nucleotide exchange factors; Ins(1,4,5)P₃, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate; M20, 20-kDa subunit; PLC, phospholipase C; SR, sarcoplasmic reticulum.

specifically inhibited by Y27632 (Refs 40, 41). These results suggest that agonists use at least the two signalling pathways to activate Rho-kinase, and then induce Ca²⁺-sensitization (Fig. 2).

PKC phosphorylates and activates CPI-17, a phosphorylation-dependent inhibitory protein of myosin phosphatase, which could be the mechanism that underlies PKC-mediated Ca²⁺-sensitization⁴². Recent evidence has shown that CPI-17 is also phosphorylated and activated by Rho-kinase, resulting in the inhibition of the myosin phosphatase activity⁴³ (Fig. 2). Further analysis is necessary to elucidate which signalling pathway is physiologically significant in agonist-induced Ca²⁺-sensitization.

In addition to MBS, MLC and CPI-17, several putative substrates of Rho-kinase have been identified²⁰,⁴⁴. Recently, calponin was shown to be a putative substrate of Rho-kinase⁴⁵. Calponin was originally discovered in smooth muscle as an actin filament-associated protein. The binding of calponin to actin filaments has an inhibitory effect on the actin-activated myosin ATPase activity, which is reversed by phosphorylation of calponin by kinases such as PKC and CaM-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II). Furthermore, Rho-kinase phosphorylates calponin to reduce the binding activity of calponin to actin filaments⁴⁵. It is tempting to speculate that the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway contributes to the regulation of smooth muscle contraction through the phosphorylation of calponin in parallel with that of MLC.

Upstream regulation of the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway  
in smooth muscle  

Recent observations have shown that many  
contraction-inducing agonists (e.g. 5-HT,  
phenylephrine, acetylcholine, U44619, endothelin,  
histamine and thromboxane A₂) mediate contraction  
of smooth muscle not only by the Ca²⁺-dependent  
activation of MLCK but also by the Ca²⁺-independent  
Rho-Rho-kinase pathway⁶,¹¹. These agonists are  
thought to couple their receptors to the Gq family  
of heterotrimeric G proteins, which links to the  
elevation of the concentration of Ca²⁺ via the  
phosphatidylinositol cascade and activation of MLCK  
(Fig. 2). However, how Rho is activated downstream of  
these agonists in smooth muscle has only recently  
been clarified. As described above, it has been  
speculated that in certain non-muscle cells Rho  
activation is linked to several heterotrimeric  
G proteins, such as G₁₂/₁₃ (Ref. 15). A more recent  
study has shown that receptors of the vasoconstrictive  
agonists angiotensin II, endothelin and vasopressin  
are coupled to G₁₂/₁₃ as well as to Gq (Ref. 46; Fig. 2).  
G₁₂/₁₃ evokes smooth muscle contraction in a  
Rho-Rho-kinase-dependent manner⁴⁶. Further  
studies are necessary to clarify which GEFs are linked  
to G₁₂/₁₃ and activate Rho in smooth muscle (Fig. 2).  
Moreover, the detailed mechanism by which agonists  
activate the multiple heterotrimeric G proteins,  
Gq and G₁₂/₁₃ needs to be determined.  

As already described, Rho activated via the  
agonist-G-protein complex is thought to be associated  
with the plasma membrane, presumably through its  
geranyl-geranylated tail. This might also be true for  
smooth muscle contraction given that the  
Ca²⁺-sensitizing activity of Rho is correlated with its  
association with the plasma membrane, and the activity  
of Rho is abolished by treatment of smooth muscle with  
Triton X-100 (Refs 47, 48). But myosin phosphatase  
that is inhibited downstream of Rho is associated with  
myosin filaments and so Rho-kinase might serve as a  
messenger between the membrane and contractile  
apparatus. Consistently, the stress fibres (non-muscle  
contractile apparatus) isolated from cultured cells by  
extensive extraction with Triton X-100, which were  
associated neither with Rho or Rho-kinase, showed  
only Ca²⁺-dependent contraction (K. Katoh et al.,  
unpublished). By contrast, however, in the stress fibres  
isolated with glycerol instead of Triton X-100, Rho,  
Rho-kinase and MBS were shown to be colocalized on  
the stress fibres. Following the addition of ATP, the  
latter isolated stress fibres contracted in a Rho-kinase-  
dependent manner in the absence of Ca²⁺, which was  
accompanied by the enhanced phosphorylation of MLC  
and MBS (K. Katoh et al., unpublished). These results  
suggest that some membrane fractions that contain  
activated Rho and Rho-kinase, or activated Rho or  
Rho-kinase by themselves are closely associated with  
the contractile apparatus. Further work is needed to  
determine how activated Rho and Rho-kinase are  
associated with the contractile apparatus.  

Pathological roles of the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway  
in various diseases  

Pathological as well as physiological roles of  
Rho-kinase have been evaluated using specific  
Rho-kinase inhibitors such as Y27632. Y27632  
reduces the high blood pressure of hypertensive rats  
in a dose-dependent manner, whereas at comparable  
doses it has no effect on normal blood pressure¹¹. This  
finding revealed that the Rho-Rho-kinase-mediated  
Ca²⁺-sensitization of smooth muscle contraction can  
cause hypertension. Such inhibitors are likely to lead  
to improved treatment for hypertension.  

The physiological role of the Rho-Rho-kinase  
pathway has been investigated in more detail with a  
spastic model of porcine coronary artery. In this  
model, the adventitia of the artery is treated locally  
with an inflammatory cytokine, interleukin 1β  
(IL-1β), which induces the adventitial inflammatory  
lesion and sequential arteriosclerotic remodelling⁴⁹.  
Histamine, 5-HT and platelet-activating factor cause  
coronary hyperconstriction (i.e. coronary artery  
spasm) locally at the segment treated with IL-1β  
(Ref. 49). In the 5-HT-induced spastic site, the  
phosphorylation of MLC is enhanced and there is a  
positive correlation between the extent of  
vasoconstriction and that of MLC phosphorylation⁴⁹.  
Hydroxyfasudil, a metabolite of fasudil, has a specific  
inhibitory effect on Rho-kinase¹². Hydroxyfasudil  
inhibits the 5-HT-induced coronary hypercontraction  
in a dose-dependent manner¹². This inhibition of  
spasm is accompanied by the inhibition of the 5-HT-  
induced MLC phosphorylation¹². These results  
indicate that the enhanced MLC phosphorylation via  
the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway plays a crucial role in  
pathogenesis of coronary artery spasm. Furthermore,  
a study using an antibody that specifically detects the  
Ser849/854-phosphorylation of MBS by Rho-kinase  
has shown that the phosphorylation of MBS is  
significantly greater in the spastic lesion than in the  
control site. In addition, the extent of the  
phosphorylation is significantly correlated with the  
severity of the contraction¹³. The enhanced  
phosphorylation of MBS is inhibited by Y27632  
(Ref. 13). Interestingly, in the spastic site the  
expression of ROKβ mRNA is significantly increased¹³.  
It is suggested that Rho-kinase is upregulated at the  
spastic site and causes hypercontraction by the  
inhibition of myosin phosphatase activity through the  
phosphorylation of MBS. The mechanism for the  
increased expression of ROKβ mRNA in coronary  
spasm remains to be evaluated. In the canine cerebral  
vasospasm following experimental subarachnoid  
haemorrhage, the hypercontraction and enhanced  
MLC phosphorylation in artery are inhibited by  
Y27632 (Ref. 50). If these findings can be extrapolated  
to human patients, Rho-kinase could be a therapeutic  
target for many diseases that stem from abnormal  
smooth muscle contraction.  

Arteriosclerosis could be a common cause of  
vasospasm and hypertension. The pathogenesis of

arteriosclerosis involves the chronic proliferation, migration and invasion of macrophages, smooth muscle cells, or endothelial cells, or all three, which then establish histological alterations such as a neointimal formation and pathological vascular remodelling. Recent evidence has revealed that the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway plays a role in establishing arteriosclerotic lesions. The inhibition of Rho-kinase by specific inhibitors inhibits neointimal formation as observed following angioplasty⁵¹⁻⁵⁴. Rho-kinase appears to be involved in neointimal formation by regulating the migration and invasion of macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells from adventitia to the media or intima of arteries⁵¹, ⁵³, ⁵⁴. Furthermore, the long-term inhibition of Rho-kinase by fasudil or adenovirus-mediated transfer of the dominant-negative Rho-kinase [RB/PH(TT)] induced marked regression of the arteriosclerosis lesion as well as reduction of vasospasm in the above porcine model⁴⁹ (H. Shimokawa et al., unpublished). The Rho-Rho-kinase pathway also plays an important role in various cellular functions, including the formation of stress fibres and focal adhesions, cytokinesis, cell motility and cell migration (as described below). Rho-kinase is involved in the pathogenesis of arteriosclerosis through the regulation not only of smooth muscle contraction but also of the various non-muscle cell functions. Taken together, these observations suggest that the modulation of Rho-kinase activity could be a novel treatment for arteriosclerosis in addition to hypertension and spasm.

Phosphorylation of MBS by Rho-kinase also occurs in most instances²⁰, ³⁷, ⁵⁶, ⁵⁷. The regulatory mechanism of the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway, analogous to that in smooth muscle, could play crucial roles in non-muscle-cell functions.  
In addition to MBS and MLC, Rho-kinase also phosphorylates several other proteins (Refs 20, 44; Table 1), and regulates: (1) the formation of microvilli through the phosphorylation of the ERM (ezrin, radixin, moesin) family proteins; (2) membrane ruffling and cell migration through adducin; (3) cytokinesis through glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP); and (4) collapse of neuronal growth cone by LPA through collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) 2 (Ref. 59). Rho-kinase also phosphorylates the Na⁺-H⁺ exchanger to cause its activation⁶⁰. LIM-kinase, which phosphorylates cofilin, thereby inhibiting the ability of the latter to depolymerize actin filaments, is phosphorylated and activated by Rho-kinase⁶¹. Rho-kinase regulates the reorganization of actin cytoskeletons through the activation of LIM-kinase, which leads to the phosphorylation and inactivation of cofilin.  
The Rho-Rho-kinase pathway might thus contribute widely to various physiological and pathological states in cells by regulating the phosphorylation state of the various proteins as well as that of MLC.

Rho-Rho-kinase pathway in non-muscle cell functions  
Activity of non-muscle myosin II is also regulated by the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of MLC, and mediates a variety of cellular events. It is likely that the contractile regulatory mechanism described above is important in the regulation of non-muscle cell functions mediated by myosin II. Indeed, several studies have revealed that the Rho-Rho-kinase pathway plays a crucial role in various non-muscle cell functions via the MLC phosphorylation, including

# Airway goblet-cell mucus secretion

## Alan D. Jackson

A mucus hypersecretory phenotype is a dominant characteristic of chronic airways diseases such as chronic bronchitis and asthma. This phenotype develops following chronic exposure of the respiratory tract to particulate matter, allergens, irritants and/or pathogens. The associated increase in the mucus-producing potential of the respiratory epithelium represents an innate host response that can be modulated by elements of the adaptive host response. Although elevation of mucus production is designed to protect the airways, increasing evidence suggests that in excess it can be detrimental to health. Considerable progress has been made over the past five years in understanding the mechanisms involved in the development and regulation of the hypersecretory phenotype. This progress has set the stage for the development of successful dedicated mucomodulatory strategies to counter the negative impact of excess mucus production in respiratory disease.

Chronic mucus hypersecretion is an important symptomatic and pathological feature of chronic respiratory diseases including chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. In asthma such hypersecretion contributes to the development of viscous mucus plugs that can occlude even the large airways and in chronic bronchitis it contributes to early morning coughing, sputum

production and airways obstruction¹,². Other symptoms of mucus hypersecretion include an increase in the frequency and duration of respiratory infections and an excessive decline in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV₁). Mucus hypersecretion has also been shown to have prognostic value with respect to hospitalization, morbidity and mortality³,⁴.

### Mucins

The major macromolecular component of respiratory mucus appears to be the product of two mucin genes, *MUC5AC* and *MUC5B* (Refs 5,6). These genes encode mucin apoproteins, which become heavily glycosylated following translation to form mature glycoproteins, or mucins, which give mucus its characteristic gel-like properties. Unlike the membrane-bound mucins (e.g. MUC1), the gel-forming mucins are packaged into the secretory granules of specific dedicated mucus-producing cells (goblet cells) ready for rapid expulsion to protect the surface epithelium from xenobiotics⁷. The regulation of goblet-cell production of gel-forming mucins in the respiratory tract forms the basis for this review.
