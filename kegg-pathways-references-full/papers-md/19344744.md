### ABSTRACT

Oxygenated fatty acids such as ricinoleic acid and vernolic acid can serve in the industry as synths for the synthesis of a wide range of chemicals and polymers traditionally produced by chemical conversion of petroleum derivatives. Oxygenated fatty acids can also be useful to synthesize specialty chemicals such as cosmetics and aromas. There is thus a strong interest in producing these fatty acids in seed oils (triacylglycerols) of crop species. In the last 15 years or so, much effort has been devoted to isolate key genes encoding proteins involved in the synthesis of oxygenated fatty acids and to express them in the seeds of the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* or crop species. An often overlooked but rich source of enzymes catalyzing the synthesis of oxygenated fatty acids and their esterification to glycerol is the biosynthetic pathways of the plant lipid polyesters cutin and suberin. These protective polymers found in specific tissues of all higher plants are composed of a wide variety of oxygenated fatty acids, many of which have not been reported in seed oils (e.g. saturated $\omega$-hydroxy fatty acids and $\alpha,\omega$-diacids). The purpose of this mini-review is to give an overview of the recent advances in the biosynthesis of cutin and suberin and discuss their potential utility in producing specific oxygenated fatty acids for specialty chemicals. Special emphasis is given to the role played by specific acyltransferases and P450 fatty acid oxidases. The use of plant surfaces as possible sinks for the accumulation of high value-added lipids is also highlighted.

### 1. Introduction

Oils highly enriched in a single fatty acid with double bonds or functional groups in specific positions are used in a variety of commercial products such as lubricants, cosmetics polymers and paints [1,2]. A well known example of fatty acid of industrial interest is ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxy-oleic acid). Castor oil (>90% ricinoleic acid) is currently the only economically viable source of hydroxy fatty acids. It is used for the synthesis of a range of products including resins, coatings, dyes, nylons, plastics, soaps, inks and biofuel.

Current oilseed crops such as soybean, rapeseed, and sunflower do not produce hydroxy fatty acids or any other oxygenated fatty acid naturally. Moreover, the native species synthesizing these fatty acids have poor agronomic traits, prohibiting traditional farming for the large-scale production of industrial oils. There is therefore a strong interest in having a cost-effective system producing oxygenated fatty acids (and other unusual fatty acids) in oilseed crops.

Many efforts from both industrial and academic labs have been directed toward producing oxygenated fatty acids in oilseed crops via biotechnological means. This typically involves identifying the plant species that store the desired fatty acids, cloning the structural gene responsible for its synthesis, and introducing it into the model plant *Arabidopsis thaliana* and then a crop species such as *Brassica napus*. Although these attempts have generally been proven in principle, they have failed to produce oxygenated fatty acids to an amount which is economically viable, i.e. low amounts were obtained compared to native species [2]. This failure highlights the gaps in our understanding of the biosynthesis and metabolism of oxygenated fatty acids. Various issues related to the low yield in transgenic production of oxygenated (or other unusual) fatty acids in model or crop species have been addressed in several reviews [1–4].

While only a limited number of plant species synthesize oxygenated fatty acids in their seed oils, all higher plants produce a large variety of oxygenated fatty acids and their derivatives for the synthesis of surface lipids. Possible biotechnological applications of genes related to the biosynthesis of soluble surface lipids (waxes)

have been recently reviewed [5]. In this mini-review, we limit our scope to the biosynthetic pathway of the major polymeric surface lipids (cutin and suberin) and in particular to the enzymes that are potentially interesting for the production of oxygenated fatty acids.

2. A rich source of enzymes synthesizing oxygenated fatty acids

Plants can synthesize a variety of oxygenated fatty acids. They are either signaling molecules (jasmonates and other oxylipins), or part of membrane lipids (long-chain saturated 2-hydroxy fatty acids of sphingolipids), or present as components of storage lipids in a limited number of species (e.g. ricinoleic acid of castor oil). In addition, all higher plants have the ability to synthesize various oxygenated fatty acids which are basic elements of the protective lipid polyesters cutin and suberin [6–11]. Cutin is the structural backbone of the waxy cuticle, which covers and seals the epidermis of aerial parts of plants. Suberin is the other major type of plant lipid polyester. Unlike cutin, suberin possesses substantial amounts of aromatics in addition to its aliphatic content. Suberin is deposited constitutively in specific tissues such as root endodermis and periderm but it is also synthesized upon wounding or pathogen attacks, including in aerial plant parts.

Chemical depolymerization of cutin in different plant species and organs has revealed that the aliphatic monomer composition can vary substantially between organs of the same species and between similar organs of various species [11,12]. This is also observed for suberin [10,11]. Overall, a wide diversity of fatty acids of chain length ranging from C8 to C34, with hydroxyl, epoxy and carboxyl groups at various positions, of different degrees of unsaturation is found. Not considering oxylipins, it is clear that cutin and suberin account for much of the diversity of the major oxygenated

fatty acids found in plants (Table 1). Most importantly, several oxygenated fatty acids of industrial interest such as ω-hydroxy fatty acids and α,ω-diacids are common components in suberin and/or cutin but have rarely been found in seed oils.

It is thus clear that tissues synthesizing lipid polyesters are good sources for the isolation of a variety of enzymes synthesizing oxygenated fatty acids (Fig. 1). Most of those that have been identified so far belong to the superfamily of cytochrome P450s, which is found in all domains of life [13]. The most common reaction catalyzed by a cytochrome P450 is a monooxygenase reaction, i.e. the insertion of one atom of a molecule of oxygen into an organic substrate while the other oxygen atom is reduced to water. P450s can be used in a variety of biotechnological applications [14]. In plants, cytochrome P450 monooxygenase is one of the largest family of enzymatic proteins (for example, >250 genes and 72 families in Arabidopsis). They catalyze a wide range of biosynthetic reactions, leading to various fatty acid conjugates, plant hormones or defensive compounds [15].

2.1. Fatty acyl ω-hydroxylases

Fatty acids with hydroxyl groups on the terminal carbon (ω-hydroxy fatty acids) could be used in a variety of industrial applications similar to those of ricinoleic acid. Fatty acids with ω-hydroxyl groups are also logical synthons for synthetic polyesters. In addition, some ω-hydroxy fatty acid have pharmaceutical properties. For example, ω-hydroxypalmitic acid and its ethyl ester derivative have been found to have carcinostatic activity on Ehrlich ascites tumor cells and ω-hydroxystearic acid has been shown to have strong growth-inhibiting and cytotoxic activity on a human melanoma cell line [16,17].

To our knowledge, the only species reported to accumulate in their seed oils fatty acids with ω-hydroxyl groups are the Kamala tree (*Mallotus philippensis* Muell.), which has >50% 18-hydroxy-9,11,13-octadecatrienoic acid [18,19], and the Grecian thistle *Chamaepeuce afra* (syn. *Ptilostemon af er* (Jacq.) Greuter), which contains 14% of *threo*-9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadec-*cis*-12-enoic acid and 9% of its saturated analog [20].

The fatty acid ω-hydroxylases of the seed oils of the Kamala tree and the Grecian thistle have not been cloned but several ω-hydroxylases essential for the synthesis of ω-hydroxylated fatty acid, monomers of cutin or suberin have been identified in the model plant *A. thaliana*. They have been shown to belong to CYP86A, a subfamily of five P450 monoxygenases [21,22]. Evidences come from activities of recombinant proteins expressed in yeast and analysis of *Arabidopsis* mutants [23–29]. One of the CYP86A members (CYP86A1), a long-chain ω-hydroxylase required for suberin synthesis [26,29], has been proposed to be localized to the endoplasmic reticulum using a protein-GFP fusion [29].

### 2.2. Mid-chain hydroxylases

Mid-chain hydroxy fatty acids could be useful to modify the physical properties of some industrial products based on ricinoleic acid. Besides, fatty acids of particular chain lengths with in-chain hydroxyl groups at a specific position could also be synthons for the production of various specialty chemicals such as macrocyclic musk perfumes and aromas.

The hydroxylase that produces the ricinoleic acid (12-hydroxy-oleic acid) of castor seed oil has been shown to be a homolog of the Δ12 oleic acid desaturase present in the vast majority of higher plants [30,31]. The castor oil hydroxylase is therefore completely unrelated to cytochrome P450s. However, several proteins catalyzing the in-chain hydroxylation of carbon chains have been identified in various plant P450 subfamilies of P450s: CYP81B, CYP709C, CYP703 and CYP96A [32–35]. Regarding lipid polyesters, biochemical studies on microsomal fractions from the shoots of germinating *Vicia faba* showed that 10,16-dihydroxypalmitate, a major C16 cutin monomer in many organs and plant species, is synthesized from palmitate by the sequential action of an ω-hydroxylase and mid-chain hydroxylase [36,37] (Fig. 1). Requirement of O₂ and NADPH and photoreversible inhibition by CO strongly suggested that the mid-chain hydroxylase was a P450.

The P450 nature of the terminal hydroxylase was in doubt. We have recently obtained genetic evidence in *Arabidopsis* that a ω-hydroxylase of dihydroxypalmitate synthesis is encoded by a member of the CYP86 family but that the mid-chain hydroxylase belongs to another family of P450s (Li, Pollard, Ohlrogge and Beisson, unpublished results).

Given the wide variety of fatty acids with mid-chain hydroxyl groups that is found in cutin and suberin (Table 1), it is clear that the tissues producing these polymers are a rich source of hydroxylases with different chain length and positional specificities. These enzymes are expected to be P450s [11]. One known example of mid-chain hydroxylase involved in surface lipid synthesis is the recently identified mid-chain alkane hydroxylase CYP96A15 [35].

#### 2.3. Epoxgenases and epoxide hydrolases

Seed oils enriched in epoxy fatty acids are used in the fabrication of paints, adhesives, plasticizers and some nylons. A major epoxy fatty acid of seed oil is vernolic acid (12-epoxy-oleic acid). In the seeds of the Asteraceae *Crepis palaestina*, the epoxy group of vernolic acid is synthesized by a homolog of the FAD2 oleate desaturase [38,39], while in the seeds of the Euphorbiaceae *Euphorbia lagascae*, it is synthesized by a cytochrome P450 [40]. The epoxy group of vernolic acid can thus be generated in different plant species by structurally unrelated enzymes.

Concerning cutin and suberin, early biochemical studies in spinach, a plant with a leaf cutin rich in C18 epoxy fatty acid, have indicated that an epoxgenase activity present in a particulate fraction of young leaves was able to catalyze the epoxidation of 18-hydroxy-oleic acid to 18-hydroxy-*cis*-9,10-epoxystearic acid [41] (Fig. 1). Characterization of the activity suggested that the epoxgenase was a cytochrome P450-type enzyme. Using skin slices of rapidly growing apple fruits, it was further demonstrated that the aliphatic epoxide 18-hydroxy-*cis*-9,10-epoxystearic acid could be converted by hydrolysis to *threo*-9,10,18-trihydroxystearate, a major component of cutin in apple fruits and many other plants [42]. A soluble epoxide hydrolase activity acting on 9,10-epoxystearate has also been found in soybean seedlings [43]. An alternative pathway of synthesis of epoxylated C18 monomers involving lipoxygenases and peroxidases instead of P450 epoxgenase has been proposed in maize and soybean [44,45]. None of the enzymes involved in the synthesis of epoxylated cutin monomers have been

identified yet. Recently, an Arabidopsis cytochrome P450 (CYP77A4) has been shown to catalyze in vitro the formation of vernolic acid and 9,10-epoxystearic acid from linoleic acid and oleic acid respectively [46]. Whether CYP77A4 is involved in cutin biosynthesis remains to be determined.

### 2.4. Oxidases forming aliphatic $\alpha,\omega$-oxoacids and $\alpha,\omega$-diacids

Aliphatic $\alpha,\omega$-dicarboxylic acids (diacids) are produced in large quantities from non-renewable petrochemical feedstocks to make a wide variety of chemical applications such as plastics, plasticizers, lubricants, fibers, films, resins, adhesives and nylons [47]. In addition, diacids have applications in cosmetics and medicine [48,49]. Diacids with carbon numbers greater than 13 are difficult to synthesize chemically. It is worth noting that sebacic acid (C10 dioic acid) is produced from ricinoleic acid and a few diacids are produced using microbial P450 enzymes.

Long-chain and very-long-chain diacids have not been found in seed oils but they are common components of suberin (Table 1). In cutins, saturated diacids are almost always present. Long-chain unsaturated diacids, which were previously considered typical of suberins, have been found to accumulate in cutins of some Brassicaceae species [50,51].

Enzymology studies from the seventies using extracts of leaf epidermis or suberized periderm have shown that diacids are produced from $\omega$-hydroxy fatty acids by two sequential NADP-dependent oxidoreductases [52–54], the first of which would give rise to an $\omega$-oxo fatty acid intermediate (Fig. 1). More recently, an Arabidopsis protein encoded by *HOTHEAD* which belongs to a family of glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductases [55] has been shown to be essential for diacid accumulation in cutin and was thus proposed to catalyze the conversion of $\omega$-hydroxy fatty acids to $\omega$-oxo fatty acids [56]. The biochemical characterization of HOTHEAD will be necessary to confirm this hypothesis. The identification in cutin or suberin metabolism of plant oxidases that can produce long-chain diacids would increase the range of the enzymatic tools available to produce diacids by biotechnological means.

### 3. A set of specific acyltransferases

The products of the complete chemical depolymerization of the suberin polyester contain a substantial proportion of glycerol in addition to aliphatic and aromatic components [57,58]. Partial chemical depolymerizations of suberins from various sources have yielded fragments which include monoacylglycerols (MAGs) of $\alpha,\omega$-dicarboxylic acids, $\omega$-hydroxy fatty acids and fatty acids, as well as diglycerol esters of $\alpha,\omega$-dicarboxylic acids [59–62]. MAGs containing $\omega$-hydroxy fatty acids have also been found in the fragments resulting from partial depolymerization of cutin [63]. It is therefore clear that both cutin and suberin contain glycerol in their structure and that some enzymes esterifying fatty acids or their derivatives to glycerol must exist in cutin and suberin biosyntheses.

#### 3.1. Production of monoacylglycerols in plant epidermis and their secretion to the surface

Using Arabidopsis insertional mutants, it has been demonstrated that 3 members of an Arabidopsis family of 8 membrane-bound acyl-CoA:glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferases (GPAT), which was initially identified based on conserved protein motifs and activity of recombinant proteins expressed in yeast [64] were required for the synthesis of lipid polyesters but not for surface waxes or membrane lipids. GPAT5 was found to be essential for suberin synthesis in roots and seeds [65] and GPAT4 and GPAT8 were shown to both contribute to the synthesis of cutin in leaves and stems [26]. Recent

data show that GPAT6 is also important for cutin synthesis (Li, Pollard, Ohlrogge, Beisson, unpublished results).

The ectopic overexpression of GPAT5 in Arabidopsis under the CaMV35S promoter resulted in accumulation of novel lipid components in the cuticular wax fraction of aerial organs, namely very-long-chain $\alpha$-MAGs and $\beta$-MAGs as well as its corresponding free fatty acids [66]. This appearance of new products was concomitant to a 2-fold decrease in standard waxes but the total amount of surface lipids (including novel components) was increased 2-fold. These results provided evidence that: (i) GPAT5 was indeed able to transfer acyl chains to a glycerol backbone (glycerol or a derivative), (ii) GPAT5 had access to the same pool of acyl intermediates as wax synthesis, (iii) the products of GPAT5 could enter a pathway of export into the apoplast (more precisely the outer cell wall of the epidermis, where waxes are also secreted) (Fig. 2).

The production of MAGs with acyl chains in internal or external position of the glycerol and of free fatty acids could be due to the action of a lipase and a phosphatase of the epidermis on a regular 2-lysophosphatidic acid product resulting from a classical glycerol-3-phosphate activity. Alternatively, this result raises several interesting possibilities such as the use of glycerol as acyl acceptor or a preference for the internal position on the glycerol backbone. The detailed characterization of the in vitro activity of GPATs using a battery of acyl acceptors and acyl donors will help to determine their actual specificity.

#### 3.2. Synergy with a P450 fatty acyl $\omega$-hydroxylase

The activity of several plant cytochrome P450 fatty acid hydroxylases has been measured in vitro using radioactive substrates and recombinant proteins expressed in yeast [21,22]. However, no successful production of hydroxy fatty acids in plants by overexpression of a cytochrome P450 enzyme was reported until a study showing that co-overexpression in Arabidopsis under the CaMV35S promoter of GPAT5 and a fatty acyl oxidase (CYP86A1) resulted in the incorporation of suberin-like monomers (i.e. very-long-chain hydroxy fatty acids and dicarboxylic acids) in leaf and stem polyesters [26]. This work opened the way to genetic engineering of cutin. It also suggested that GPAT acyltransferases were

a critical factor for the *in planta* activity of P450 fatty acid oxidases, either by providing them with the right substrate (e.g. acylglycerols) or by esterifying their products (e.g. hydroxyacyl-CoAs) or by stabilizing them in an enzymatic complex. Interestingly, a similar gene co-overexpression approach has also been proven useful in increasing the transgenic production of ricinoleic acid. Co-overexpression in *Arabidopsis* of the castor desaturase-like fatty acid hydroxylase with the castor DGAT2 acyl-CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase resulted in an increase of ricinoleic content from 17% (with hydroxylase only) to 30% of the seed’s total fatty acids for the double transgenic plants [67].

### 4. Major unknowns in the biosynthesis of polyesters

Although fast advances have been made in the last 5 years on cutin/suberin biosynthesis, we are still far from being able to draw a complete pathway. Many key enzymes of the pathway are yet to be identified, for example, the polyester synthetase(s) which catalyze the esterification of hydroxyacids to each other or to diacids remain elusive. It is also important to note that it is not even known if this key step of polyester assembly is intracellular or occurs in the apoplast. Understanding how a hydrophobic polymer or its precursors can be efficiently transported through aqueous compartments (cytosol, cell wall) and to be secreted to the epidermal surface is another major unknown. This path represents a major carbon flux at the level of epidermal cells because it has been estimated that the flux of acyl chains exported to the cell wall (cutin and waxes) can represent up to 60% of the total flux of fatty acid synthesis in epidermal cells or rapidly elongating stems [68]. Uncovering the machinery responsible for this high flux of lipid export will likely be of interest from a biotechnological perspective.

### 5. Perspectives and conclusions

#### 5.1. Increasing enzymatic tools

Genetic tools are often not available in plant species accumulating hydroxy or epoxy fatty acids in their seed oils. In addition, while EST sequencing by new high-throughput technologies will be very important to discover genes suspected to be involved in the accumulation of oxygenated fatty acids, it will be less useful to uncover proteins of novel function or proteins belonging to classes with many members involved in various cellular functions (e.g. lipases). New enzymes uncovered in plant polyester metabolism should at least increase the range of enzymatic tools available for biotechnological applications, either directly by being useful for expression in microbial systems for example, or indirectly by helping gene discoveries in other organisms.

#### 5.2. Production of oxygenated fatty acids in seed oils

It is possible that enzymes of polyester synthesis could be adapted to produce oxygenated fatty acids in seed oils by targeting them to appropriate ER subdomains [69] using for example a protein chimera approach. In any case, studying cutin and suberin metabolism in *Arabidopsis* may help circumvent some of the current bottlenecks in the production of oxygenated fatty acids in transgenic seeds because it is an alternative strategy to gain a deeper understanding of how plant cells synthesize, transfer and esterify oxygenated acyl chains. The interest of this strategy could be reinforced by the fact that many similarities and connections may exist between the syntheses of epidermal polyesters and seed oils enriched in unusual fatty acids. First, it is clear that several enzymes of unusual fatty acid synthesis are divergent forms of enzymes of normal fatty acid synthesis [2] and it might be the same

for polyesters. Second, oxygenated acylglycerols appear to be basic building blocks of lipid polyesters [8] and it is possible that oil-body-like structures are involved in lipid polyester synthesis [70]. Third, polyesters and TAGs might be two extreme forms in a continuum of polyacylglycerol structures including the glycerol estolides found in oils of *Lesquerella* [71] and thistle species [20] as well as in the lipid exudates of Solanaceous plants [72,73]. Finally, some unusual fatty acids such as the cyclopropanes [74,75] and 9,10,18-trihydroxyoctadec-*cis*-12-enoic acid and its saturated analog [20] are known to occur in both surface lipids and seed oils. The presence of C18 trihydroxy fatty acids in both cutins and some seed oils is particularly noteworthy because it raises the intriguing possibility that some activities originally involved in polyester synthesis (hydroxylases, epoxidase and epoxide hydrolase) were moved from epidermal to seed expression in some species during the course of plant evolution.

Although TAGs, estolides or large polymers are the most obvious forms to produce and store high amounts of ω-hydroxy fatty acids in seeds, other possibilities exist. For example, lactones such as the ambrettolide (oxacyclononadec-10-en-2-one) present in outer layers of ambrette (*Hibiscus abelmoschus*) seeds [76] could represent an attractive form of storage and may be an ideal form for purification and use in polymerization.

#### 5.3. Plant surfaces as a sink for lipid accumulation?

The production of monoacylglycerols by GPAT5 expressed alone and the synergy observed between GPAT5 and CYP86A1 to produce oxygenated fatty acid polyesters, suggests that other combinations of GPATs and P450 fatty acid oxidases could be used to produce different soluble oxygenated fatty acids on plant surfaces. Cork and carnauba wax are just two examples of current commercial products that are obtained by taking advantage of plant extracellular lipid accumulation. In general, the secretion mechanism associated with GPAT products could make these acyltransferases attractive enzymes to secrete other high value-added lipid materials onto the surface of plants or in secretory tissues.
