**Abstract**

A growing body of evidence suggests that highly correlated, spontaneous neural activity plays an important role in shaping connections in the developing nervous system prior to the maturation of sensory afferents. In this article we discuss the mechanisms involved in the generation and the regulation of spontaneous activity patterns in the developing retina and the developing neocortex. Spontaneous activity in the developing retina propagates across the ganglion cell layer as waves of action potentials and drives rhythmic increases in intracellular calcium in retinal neurons. Retinal waves are mediated by a combination of chemical synaptic transmission and gap junctions, and the circuitry responsible for generating retinal waves changes with age and between species. In the developing cortex, spontaneous calcium elevations propagate across clusters of cortical neurons called domains. Cortical domains are generated by a regenerative mechanism involving second messenger diffusion through gap junctions and subsequent calcium release from internal stores. The neocortical gap junction system is regulated by glutamate-triggered second messenger systems as well as neuromodulatory transmitters, suggesting extensive interactions between synaptic transmission and information flow through gap junctions. The interaction between gap junctions and chemical synaptic transmission observed in these developing networks represent a powerful mechanism by which activity across large groups of neurons can be correlated. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

1. Introduction

The adult vertebrate central nervous system (CNS) is characterized by highly organized neuronal circuits (complexity emerges). The developmental mechanisms that are responsible for the formation of these complex networks are classified in two categories: activity-dependent and activity-independent [55]. Traditionally, the earliest stages of circuit development (including establishment of cell phenotype, target selection, and the distribution of initial synaptic connections) are thought to depend solely on the genetic program of the cell — that is, independent of neural activity. The subsequent stages of development, namely synaptic refinement, are guided by neuronal activity driven by sensory inputs, and therefore is termed activity-dependent.

There is growing evidence, however, that prior to the maturation of afferent inputs, central structures rely on the spontaneous generation of neural activity to drive the early steps of circuit formation. Infusion of agents that block action potentials at the retinogeniculate synapse prevents the normal patterning of retinal ganglion cell axon arbors, indicating that before vision, neural activity profoundly influences the development of early circuits [124, 149]. Action-potential based activity is also required for thalamic axons to select their appropriate targets in cortex [24].

Spontaneous activity has been observed in a wide variety of circuits within the developing CNS [177]. This activity can be measured in cells as spontaneous firing of action potentials and/or spontaneous transient increases in intracellular calcium concentration. In many of these circuits, such as the developing spinal cord, hippocampus, retina, and neocortex, the spontaneous activity is correlated over tens to hundreds of neurons (reviewed in Ref. [46]). The coupling responsible for these correlations can be extracellular, e.g., through neurotransmitter release, or intracellular via gap junctions. Here, we review the roles of synaptic activity and gap junctional communication in generating structured activity patterns in two spontaneously active circuits, the developing retina and the developing neocortex.

[47, 170] have revealed that these spontaneous bursts propagate from one cell to the next in a wavelike manner. Recent experiments demonstrate that blockade of spontaneous retinal activity disrupts the normal pattern of retinal ganglion cell axons in its primary target, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus [124], indicating that spontaneous activity from the retina plays a critical role in the normal development of the adult visual system.

Retinal “waves” are an extremely robust phenomenon, observed in a large variety of vertebrate species, including chick, turtle, mouse, rabbit, rat, ferret and cat [169]. Though wave periodicity and velocity in all species at all ages studied are comparable, the circuitry underlying the propagation may be substantially different. In postnatal ferrets, calcium imaging shows that amacrine cells, nonspiking interneurons of the retina, undergo periodic increases in intracellular calcium simultaneously with ganglion cells [170], while in chick, many cell types in addition to amacrine and ganglion cells also undergo correlated periodic increases in intracellular calcium [25]. These results indicate that early synaptic circuits are involved in generating waves. The nature of these connections, whether they be gap junctions, fast chemical synapses, or diffusion of an excitatory substance, is the subject of intense research efforts.

In this section, we first describe the propagation properties of retinal waves observed in ferret and chick retinas and postulate their role in shaping the distribution of retinal ganglion cell arbors in their primary targets. Next, we review what is known about the functional circuitry underlying waves at different stages of development in the immature retina in both the chick and ferret, including the relative role of gap junctions and chemical synapses. Last, we will describe a biophysical model of the retina based solely on the existence of excitatory connections (but independent of the details of these connections) which is able to reproduce accurately the rhythmic and large-scale correlations characteristic of retinal waves (Table 1).

2. Neurotransmitters and gap junctions in the developing retina: retinal waves

Prior to photoreceptor maturation and eye opening, retinal ganglion cells (RGC), the projecting neurons on the retina, periodically fire bursts of action potentials. This spontaneous rhythmic activity was first measured in fetal rat pups and found to be highly correlated among neighboring ganglion cells [53]. Both extracellular recording using a multielectrode array [103] and imaging of calcium transients associated with bursts of action potentials

2.1. Spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves

The spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves have been well-characterized by fluorescence imaging of calcium indicators, a reliable marker of cell depolarizations [47]. Waves initiate in randomly distributed locations and then propagate over spatially restricted areas of the retina. The fluorescence transients are uniform over the region of tissue covered by a wave, allowing for an unambiguous definition of wave boundaries (Fig. 1A). We call the total area of retina covered by a single wave a “domain.”

A tremendous amount of information regarding the propagation properties of waves can be derived from looking at the spatial patterns of sequential domains. A summary of all the domains generated over a 2-minute period time series is shown in Fig. 1B (starting from left to right, with the first wave shown in the top left corner — note the wave shown in Fig. 1A is the second wave in the time series). Each frame contains a new domain, shown in red, with all previous domains in gray. Regions where the new domains overlap with pre-existing domains are colored black. A detailed analysis of patterns like this have led to the following conclusions. First, waves eventually tile the entire retina, as can be seen by the extensive gray areas. Second, waves initiating at intervals less than one minute respect the boundaries of pre-existing waves. This can best be seen by looking at the first wave, which is shown in blue. It is not until the tenth frame that a new wave significantly invades the boundaries defined by the first domain. By examining the intervals between neighboring waves that significantly invade each other’s territory, we have computed a “refractory period” — a finite time following activation of an area of the retina during which that area cannot participate in a subsequent wave — of 40–50 s. In other words, if a wave is initiated within 40 s of a neighboring wave, it will respect the boundaries of the domain defined by the wave. If it is initiated more than 40 s after the first wave, it will not respect the boundary. Third, no two waves look alike, meaning there are no repeating patterns of activation.

In summary, initiation sites and wave boundaries are distributed randomly across a given retina, indicating that the global patterns of waves are not determined by fixed structures such as pacemaker cells or repeated activation of the same clusters of neurons. Instead, wave boundaries arise in part from a refractory period. These observations led to the hypothesis that every region of the retina is equally likely to initiate or propagate a wave, and therefore

the global spatial patterns of waves are determined by the local history of retinal activity [47].

Two recent papers have characterized retinal waves in developing chick retina [25,173]. At all the ages studied in chick (E8–E11 [25]; E13–E18 [173]), retinal waves exhibit spatiotemporal properties similar to those in mammals. They are periodic, occurring roughly every 2 min (similar to ferret), propagate over regions of the retina containing hundreds to thousands of cells, and have random initiation locations. However, in contrast to waves seen in ferret, the waves propagate approximately twice as quickly in older chick (0.5–1.5 mm/s in E15 chick compared to 0.2–0.6 mm/s in ferret). Whether the boundaries of chick retinal waves are determined by a refractory period is not yet known.

Though the spatiotemporal properties of waves are well-characterized, the cellular mechanisms underlying initiation, propagation, and the refractory period remain to be determined. Below, we review experiments that discuss the relative role of gap junctions and early chemical synapses in mediating waves. But first, we discuss the role of this spontaneous correlated activity in the visual system development.

2.2. Retinal waves influence patterns of retinal ganglion cell axons in subcortical structures

Activity-dependent remodeling of axonal arbors has been extensively studied in the developing visual system, where correlated firing driven by early sensory experience can influence the development of adult circuits [81]. Connections within the adult visual system that are responsible for the early stages of visual processing have highly stereotypical patterns, which allow for a straightforward assessment of how altering the activity coming into the system can affect the distribution of connections (Fig. 2A). For instance, in the chick, the retinal ganglion cell axon projections to their primary target, the tectum, are refined from an initially diffuse topographic projection to the highly precise adult map [111]. This refinement is thought to be activity dependent because intraocular injections of TTX between E13 and E15 (the period of time when the spontaneous firing of chick RGC are highly correlated by waves [173]) will prevent this refinement from occurring [84]. Abolishing retinal activity also prevents the elimination of a transient ipsilateral projection from the retina to the isthmo-optic nucleus [126].

Amacrine cells can make heterologous and homologous gap junction connections and well as conventional synaptic connections with other amacrine cells and they make conventional synaptic connections with ganglion cells. Ganglion cells are tracer coupled to amacrine cells. (B) Schematic of synaptic connections between the retina and optic tectum (superior colliculus in mammals) and the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.

In mammals, the retinal ganglion cell axon arbors projecting to the LGN of the thalamus are organized both topographically as well as being segregated into eye-specific layers where the axons from one eye are spatially distinct from the inputs of the other eye (Fig. 2A). The formation of eye specific layers emerge from an initial distribution where the inputs from the two eyes are extensively intermingled. The segregation of RGC axons into eye specific layers are known to be activity dependent since intracranial infusion of TTX, a blocker of voltage-activated sodium channels, prevents the segregation from occurring [149]. Recent experiments have revealed that the action-potential-based activity that drives this segregation comes from the retina since prolonged blockade of spontaneous retinal activity also prevents the layers from emerging [124]. Blockade of spontaneous activity in a single eye also significantly alters the distribution of RGC axons, indicating that competition from the two eyes is critical for the formation of these layers. The role of spontaneous retinal activity in the refinement of retinotopic projections in the mammalian LGN has not yet been fully explored.

The experiments described above demonstrate a clear role for spontaneous retinal activity in the patterning of connections. However, they do not address what aspects of the complex spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves might play a role in driving these development processes. For example, refinement of the retinotectal projections in chick requires that spontaneous retinal activity must preserve topographic information. Propagating activity, as generated by the waves, synchronizes the activity of subsets of cells, thereby encoding their relative positions. For instance, a single retinal wave will synchronize firing of cells along a wavefront with a particular orientation on the retina. Activity patterns averaged over a large number of waves would lose orientation information, but would maintain highly correlated firing among neighboring neurons, information that might be used in the establishment of topographic projections.

The spontaneous activity must also be able to first distinguish between right vs. left eye origin. The firing pattern of the spontaneous activity, namely cells firing for a few seconds every couple minutes, ensures that RGC from the same eye are more likely to be correlated with each other than correlated with RGC from the other eye. However, this firing patterns does not provide any information that allows the target tissue to know whether the

axons have come from an ipsi- or contralateral projecting retina. This is an extremely important distinction for the target tissue to make since only the ipsilateral isthmi-optic projection is eliminated, not the contralateral one in chick, and the eye-specific layers in the LGN have a characteristic pattern that is unvarying from animal to animal. One possibility as to how activity might mediate this affect is again through the slow periodicity of waves. Periodic burst of action potentials lead to substantial increases in intracellular calcium concentration in the participating neurons. There is growing evidence that periodic changes in intracellular calcium occurring on the order of minutes can influence profoundly a variety of intracellular processes [10], including gene expression [38,41] and the establishment of cell phenotype [61]. Hence, the periodicity of circuit activation may be tuned to the periodicity of intracellular signaling required to express some yet unknown gene that acts as the substrate for activity-dependent competition to occur.

Retinal waves might also provide the activity requisite for the establishment of maps in primary visual cortex. Using an in-vitro eye-attached LGN preparation, Mooney et al. [109] demonstrated that retinal waves are propagated to the thalamus, driving LGN neurons to fire periodic bursts action potentials. These results indicate that long before eye opening, rhythmic correlated activity is likely to be propagated to primary visual cortex. Two examples of patterns that might be established by waves are ocular dominance columns [68,148] and orientation columns [28], both of which are established before there is any visual stimulation and both of which can be manipulated by altered sensory inputs [27,157]. Assuming that the spatiotemporal relations are maintained in the LGN, then the orientation information contained in individual waves, as well as the eye-specific correlations guaranteed by the slow periodicity of waves, might be used to establish these structures.

glycine, though some co-release ACh or a variety of neuropeptides. Altogether, there are more than 50 subclasses of amacrine cells, each characterized by a unique set of biochemical markers, morphology, and physiology [99,156]. Amacrine cells can make either gap junctional or conventional synaptic connections with other amacrine cells and primarily make conventional synaptic connections with ganglion cells [2,33,88]. Gap junctions can occur between amacrine cells of the same subtype (homologous) or between amacrine cells of different subtype (heterologous). Ganglion cells make no conventional synaptic connections with other ganglion cells, and they are connected via homologous gap junctions [14,102,125] (Fig. 3). Recent evidence indicates that ganglion cells are also tracer coupled to amacrine cells, in a rectifying manner [125,174]. In developing chick retina, homologous gap junctions exists between ganglion cells and heterologous junctions exist between ganglion cells and variety of other cell classes [13].

Here, we review physiological and pharmacological experiments that reveal the nature of the connections that underlie retinal waves in both chick and ferret. Though it is difficult to compare directly the relative development of the two species, the inner retinas are similar at the ages studied, and waves are seen a few days before morphologically mature conventional synapses emerge (P3 in ferret, E11 in chick).

In postnatal ferrets and mice, chemical synaptic transmission is a prerequisite for wave propagation, as indicated by several experimental results. First, simultaneous whole cell voltage clamp recordings from ganglion cells demonstrate that increases in \([Ca^{2+}]\) correlated across cells are driven by compound synaptic inputs [48] (Fig. 4). Second, the compound postsynaptic currents measured from ganglion cells are blocked by bath application of \(Cd^{2+}\), a blocker of calcium channels associated with transmitter release [48]. Third, the periodic \(Ca^{2+}\) increases, action potential, and compound postsynaptic currents associated

## 2.3. The role of chemical synaptic transmission in retinal wave generation

Waves are first seen around the same time that neurons residing in the inner retina are starting to form circuits while the outer retinal neurons have not made synaptic connections and photoreceptors are not yet functional [57,104]. A schematic of inner retinal circuitry connectivity shown in Fig. 2B. At this stage of development, ganglion cells have migrated into the ganglion cell layer and their axons have begun to make connections with their primary targets, the LGN in mammals, and the tectum in chick (Fig. 2A). Amacrine cells, which are the horizontally projecting interneurons of the inner retina, make connections with other amacrine cells as well as ganglion cells. The primary transmitter of amacrine cells are GABA and

Black somata are cell bodies within the ganglion cell layer; white somata are cell bodies in the amacrine cell layer. There was no evidence of beta ganglion cells coupling to any other cells [125].

Extracellular recordings from ganglion cells show that they fire bursts of action potentials (upper trace) coincident with fractional changes in fura-2 fluorescence (bottom trace) corresponding to waves propagating through the local area of tissue.

with waves can all be blocked by a variety of nAChRs antagonists [48,125]. Note, in the adult retina, acetylcholine acts as a modulator of ganglion cell firing, while glutamate is the primary excitatory transmitter. However, at the earliest ages studied, glutamatergic blockers do not affect wave generation [170].

Is acetylcholine involved only in the initiation of waves or is it also involved in the propagation of activity from area of the retina to another? To address this question, a large number of cells within the ganglion cell layer can be depolarized directly by pressure ejection of potassium from a pipette [48]. Such a large-scale depolarization reliably initiates waves. However, in the presence of nAChR antagonists, pressure ejection of potassium still causes a large depolarization of cells around the pipette, waves cannot be generated. These experiments indicate that cholinergic synaptic transmission is required for propagation of the activity away from a local area of depolarization.

The sole source of the ACh in the retina is a subclass of amacrine cells, called starburst amacrine cells. Immunohistochemical stains for choline acetyltransferase reveal that this population of cells exist early in the developing ferret retina. Zhou [180] simultaneously recorded from rabbit starburst amacrine and ganglion cells and found that starburst cells undergo spontaneous depolarizations that are correlated with the depolarizations of neighboring ganglion cells. These experiments also show that, like ganglion cells, starburst amacrine cells are excited via synaptic input during waves. Though starburst cells have the ability to fire action potentials early in development [181], they do not reach action potential threshold during waves [180], indicating that they release ACh in a action-potential independent, graded fashion, characteristic of adult amacrine cells. Though the source of synaptic input to starburst amacrine cells during waves is unknown, these results indicate that a complex network of amacrine and ganglion cells connected via excitatory chemical synapses mediates retinal waves.

The synaptic circuitry that drives retinal waves changes postnatally. Though cholinergic neurotransmission is required and GABA contributes to the depolarization of cells during retinal waves early in development in the ferret, recent studies in older ferrets indicate that waves are insensitive to cholinergic antagonists and can be blocked by glutamate receptor antagonists [169]. This switch in the requisite transmitter occurs at the age that bipolar cells are making their initial synaptic connections with ganglion

cells and while conventional synapses between amacrine and ganglion cells become morphologically mature and numerous. This leads to the hypothesis that perhaps waves are mediated by neurotransmitters only when the synapses are first forming. A similar switch in excitatory mechanisms occurs in the developing cortex as gap junctions are replaced by conventional synapses, described below.

GABA has a modulatory role in retinal waves. Imaging of the spontaneous increases in Ca²⁺ associated with waves has shown that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonists can alter dramatically the amount of wave-induced depolarization [50]. GABA is the primary transmitter of most amacrine cells in the retina, and, at the youngest ages studied, it provides excitatory input for ganglion cells [50]. Unlike ACh, however, GABA does not influence wave periodicity since GABA blockers do not alter either the frequency of the cholinergic barrages that are associated with waves measured in ganglion cells [48] or other properties of wave propagation at ages less than P10 [50].

Waves persist after GABA becomes inhibitory [50]. However, these changes in the circuitry mediating waves with development leads to a changes in the frequency of events occurring in different subsets of ganglion cells. In ferrets before P14, all waves involve ON and OFF ganglion cells. At ages older than P21, however, OFF cells continue to participate in waves with the same frequency, but the ON cells participate in only 30% of the waves [50]. The circuitry underlying these different temporal patterns has not yet been identified.

### 2.4. A role for gap junctions in retinal waves?

Gap junctions are involved in wave generation in the chick retina. At all ages, agents that are known to inhibit transmission through gap junctions can significantly inhibit waves [25,173]. Octanol, which significantly inhibits waves in E8 chick retina also restricts tracer coupling between ganglion cells and other cell types but not ganglion–ganglion cell coupling, indicating that the circuitry mediating waves involves cells other than ganglion cells. Neurotransmitters also affect wave propagation, and, as in the ferret, the modulatory role of different transmitter systems changes with age. At the earliest ages studied (E8–E11), wave frequency decreases in the presence of an ACh antagonist and increases in an ACh agonist but waves are not blocked. Waves are unaffected by GABA<sub>A</sub> and glutamate receptor antagonists [25]. At the older ages (past E11), waves are blocked completely by a combination of glutamate antagonists, increase in frequency in the presence of a GABA<sub>A</sub> antagonist, and are unaffected by ACh antagonists [173].

Do gap junctions play a role in mammalian waves? The requirement for cholinergic transmission does not necessarily rule out a role for gap junctions since ACh might act to modulate transmission through gap junctions, as described below for the developing neocortex. Gap junctional coupling in postnatal ferrets has been assessed by neurobi-

otin coupling [125], indicating that the anatomical basis for gap junctions may exist. Gap junctions between ganglion cells are not likely to be the substrate of wave propagation since the tracer coupling is restricted to ganglion cells of the same subtype, and a major class of ganglion cells, the betas, show no evidence of coupling. In addition, ganglion cell coupling is initially weak, then becomes stronger with age while the correlations generated by waves become weaker with age [171]. However, tracer coupling between amacrine cells at this age is yet to be defined. In addition, gap junctions between ganglion and amacrine cells could provide a possible source by which excitation is transferred from the ganglion cell layer back to the amacrine cell layer.

Recent experiments have demonstrated that agents known to modulate coupling through gap junctions by modulation of intracellular levels of cAMP [63,107] have dramatic effects on the propagation properties of waves [155]. Similar to the effects seen in the developing chick retina [25], forskolin, dopamine and adenosine agonists all lead to bigger, faster and more frequent waves in ferret and mouse retinas. Experiments testing the effects of these agents on coupling in the immature retina have not yet been explored. Another possibility is that gap junctions may play a more important role at earlier stages of development, before chemical synapses have started to form in the mammalian retina.

### 2.5. Spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves can be reproduced by a simple model

Different species, at different stages of development, produce retinal waves using different strategies [169]. Yet, the spatiotemporal properties of retinal waves, which are characterized by a slow periodicity (minutes), correlations over large spatial scales (hundreds of microns), and a wavefront propagation on the order of hundreds of microns per second, are remarkably similar. These observations indicate that models based on these systems-level properties, rather than the detailed biophysical properties of the neurons that comprise the circuit, will reveal the basic organizational principles of neural circuits that lead to generation of propagating rhythmic activity. Such a computational model has been proposed for the developing retina [47]. The model consists of two cell types, amacrine and ganglion cells (Fig. 5A). This model is a discrete time model, with the state of each cell updated at time point following a set of rules specific for each cell type. Amacrine cells can either by depolarized spontaneously, with a spontaneous firing rate *p*, or through input from other amacrine cells. After an individual amacrine cell is driven above threshold, *q*, it enters a long refractory period during which is cannot be stimulated by its neighbors. Ganglion cells receive excitatory inputs from amacrine cells but are passive, meaning they are not spontaneously active. Ganglion cells therefore act as a spatially filtered “read-out”

of the activity that goes on in the amacrine cells layer. It is this read-out of the activity in the ganglion cell layer (Fig. 5B) that we compare to the experimental results fluorescence imaging results pictured in Fig. 1. Without making any assumptions about the nature of the connections between the neurons make up the circuit, waves generated by simulations of the model retina accurately reproduce the spatiotemporal properties of waves measured experimentally in newborn ferrets. All that is required for this model to reproduce the propagation properties of waves is spontaneous random activity and a long intrinsic refractory period in individual amacrine cells. Waves are initiated when a sufficient number of spontaneous events occur in a local region in a given time interval, and waves terminate when they encounter areas with a high number of refractory cells. This model provides a useful tool for exploring several different regimes of wave behavior of the model (Fig. 6), which are found by manipulating two of the model’s parameters, $q$ and $p$ [19]. The values in the center of the phase plot lead to simulated waves that have the same gross properties as the retinal waves seen experimentally. By increasing $q$, the threshold for amacrine cell firing (Regime V), waves are prevented from propagating. If the threshold is lowered, waves will initiate very frequently. Changing the spontaneous rate of initiation changes the size of waves; if the rate is low, then waves will initiate less frequently, however they will propagate further since more of the surrounding cells will be nonrefractory, leading to large waves (Regime III). Higher $p$ leads to waves initiating more frequently, and therefore more cells will be refractory, preventing waves from propagating, and hence they will be small. The goal of this analysis is to understand the cellular mechanisms that underlie these model

parameters. For instance, the effects of pharmacological manipulations on wave spatiotemporal properties can be described through these model parameters. One obvious example is the observation that nAChR antagonists prevent wave propagation and therefore can be viewed as raising the threshold of amacrine cell activation. Hence, the model predicts that nAChR antagonists are acting on the amacrine cell layer. Another example can be found in the affects of forskolin, which dramatically increases wave size in ferret [155] and chick [25]. The model would predict that forskolin might be acting to lower the initiation probability. and demonstrate how the variation of cellular parameters can lead to dramatic changes in wave propagation properties. Only through combining the predictions of the model with physiology and pharmacology can we understand how this spontaneous correlated activity is generated.

### 3. Gap junctions in the developing neocortex

As discussed in Section 2 the early activity patterns in the developing retina are transmitted to the visual thalamus [109] and from there correlated activity is very likely to be relayed to the visual cortex. Although it is not known yet whether there is a causal relationship between retinal waves and biochemically mediated neuronal domains in the visual cortex [77,78], both forms of coordinated activity may play a role in defining the boundaries of a crude pattern of functional domains in the neocortex. The initiation of domains is triggered by activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors [77,78], which could be mediated by glutamate release from immature thalamocortical or intracortical synaptic connections. The cortical gap junction system is furthermore regulated by a variety of neuromodulator induced second messenger pathways [145], which may contribute to the spatiotemporal fine tuning of cooperative neuronal assemblies. In the following sections we will discuss the development, the regulation and possible functional implications of gap junction coupling in the developing neocortex.

#### 3.1. Developmental time course of gap junction coupling in the neocortex

Gap junctions represent an electrical and metabolic communication system regulating cellular functions in a number of vertebrate CNS structures. Interneuronal coupling via gap junctions are found in a variety of different structures in the adult CNS such as the retina [79,110,130,168,175], the inferior olive ([95,96]; Sotelo et al., 1974), or the hippocampus (MacVicar and Dudek, 1981; [128]). However, in other parts of the CNS such as the neocortex [31,123], spinal cord [52,153,163], or the retina [47,103,170], gap junctions seem to have a transient developmental function.

During early development of the neocortex, neuronal precursors and radial glia in the ventricular zone aggregate in gap junction coupled clusters [97]. Coupling and uncoupling is cell cycle phase specific [12,98]. In the ventricular zone, cortical neuroblasts display extensive coupling via gap junctions [97]. Following the final mitosis, gap junctional contacts are disrupted and the postmitotic neurons start to migrate into the developing cortical plate [98]. Later on a similar pattern of transient gap junction coupling is repeated in the cortical plate: postmitotic pyramidal neurons form coupled clusters which gradually decrease in size. This new formation of electrotonic contacts between postmitotic neurons indicates that gap junction coupling during the period of synaptogenesis and circuit formation does not simply represent a developmental remnant of coupling between progenitor cells, but probably has an important function during later stages of development. During the first postnatal week, deep and superficial pyramidal neurons are coupled via the apical dendrites of deep layer neurons, thus creating the typical columnar appearance of gap junction coupled cell clusters [123]. Dye coupling between deep and superficial pyramidal cells disappears during the second postnatal week (Fig. 7). At this stage, concentric coupled cell clusters are found in lamina II/III whereas deep layer pyramids are already uncoupled [123,139,141]. These observations indicate that the extent of gap junction coupling correlates with the state of differentiation, and thus it follows the “inside-first outside-last” gradient of cortical development. Classical chemical synaptic transmission in the developing neocortex slowly sets in within the first postnatal weeks, as demonstrated in rodent [159] and ferret [77,78]. At the end of chemical synaptogenesis cortical neurons are either completely uncoupled or coupled to only one or two neighboring neurons [77,78,123,141].

##### 3.2. Functions of the early gap junction system: electrical vs. chemical communication

Interneuronal coupling via gap junctions in the developing cortical plate has been demonstrated via dye coupling [78,123,141] and, in addition, gap junction mediated synchronized increases in intracellular calcium concentrations in clusters of coupled neurons have been described a few years ago [75,76,178,179]. The discovery of these so-called neuronal microdomains has prompted the hypothesis that gap junctions might preform cortical columns, thus representing a blueprint of the adult neocortical synaptic circuitry.

The classical function of gap junctions in both neuronal, e.g., the teleost Mauthner cell, and nonneuronal tissues, e.g., the heart muscle, is a fast distribution of electrical current. This allows for fast reflex responses and the synchronization of muscle contractions, respectively. In the developing neocortex, however, junctional conductance

By P18 (C) the majority of pyramidal neurons were completely uncoupled. (D) Mean number of cells (± S.E.M.) coupled to individual neurobiotin — filled neurons plotted against postnatal age.

is small [31,123] and the major function of interneuronal coupling appears to be metabolic, i.e., allowing for fast transfer of chemical messengers between coupled cells [77].

Gap junction channels represent relatively large pores, approximately 1.5 nm in diameter, passing not only ions but also metabolites and small molecules up to 1.5 kDa. The permeation of IP₃ and cAMP through gap junctions has been demonstrated earlier [105]. The synchronous gap junction-mediated calcium elevations observed by Yuste et

al. [178,179] in the immature neocortex is triggered by IP₃ receptor-mediated calcium release from intracellular stores, and propagated by diffusion of IP₃ through gap junctions which, in turn, results in calcium release and regenerative IP₃ production in coupled cells [75,76]. IP₃ production is activated via metabotropic glutamate receptors [77] (Fig. 8). Thus, coordination of neuronal activity via second messenger transfer seems to represent an important developmental function of neocortical gap junctions. Since low molecular weight messengers like cAMP are important

regulators of gene expression, coupled neurons may not only synchronize their metabolic state but may also coordinate transcriptional activity. Paysan et al. [122] described a clustered expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits during development of rat cerebral cortex. These clusters occur during the early postnatal period and disappear during the second postnatal week. The size and distribution of cell groups immunoreactive for the α1 subunit of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor resembled those of gap junction coupled clusters and the time course of coordinated expression of neurotransmitter receptor subunits closely corresponds to the occurrence of microdomains [179] and dye-coupled neuronal clusters [123]. This indicates that synchronized expression of proteins may be mediated by transfer of a signaling molecule through gap junctions. Gap junction coupled cells might thus express a common molecular phenotype.

### 3.3. Electrotonic effects of the gap junction system

Although electrical current spread through gap junctions may play only a minor role in the developing neocortex, extensive electrotonic coupling does have an effect on electrical communication. The functional extension of membrane surface area resulting from gap junction coupling can tremendously alter the apparent electrotonic structure of coupled cells, a decrease in input resistance being the most important consequence. The electrotonic properties of a neuron can have a tremendous impact on the magnitude and the time course of synaptic currents. Thus the extent of coupling influences the efficacy of chemical transmission. In many cell types, reducing gap junction permeability, e.g., by intracellular acidification or application of octanol, results in an increase in input resistance and a decrease in membrane capacitance large enough to be measured at the whole cell level [11, 97, 108]. These alterations in input resistance and cell capacitance in turn affect membrane time constants and electrotonic length.

To investigate the influence of gap junctions on electrotonic properties of developing rat neocortical neurons we have used intracellular acidification as a fast and reversible method to uncouple pyramidal neurons in one of our previous studies [141]. We observed a 20% reduction in membrane time constant (τ<sub>0</sub>) in the majority of cells tested. The first equalizing time constant τ<sub>1</sub> [133] was dramatically reduced (by 80%), resulting in a reduction of the electronic length by approximately 20% [141]. Input resistance, and hence neuronal electrotonic structure is determined by the specific membrane resistivity (R<sub>m</sub>), the cellular morphology and the internal resistivity (R<sub>i</sub>). By electrotonically coupling adjacent neurons, gap junctions increase the apparent membrane surface area, leading to a decrease in input resistance and an increase in cell capacitance. Both parameters determine the membrane time constant.

Closing of gap junctions leads to an increase in input resistance and a decrease in cell capacitance; the effect on membrane time constant thus depends on the relative contribution of both parameters. These changes in electrotonic cell parameters were exclusively observed in dye-coupled neurons between P1 and P12. In more differentiated neurons, which no longer showed dye-coupling, these effects were absent [141], indicating that the effects on electrotonic structure were indeed due to a reduction in gap junction permeability. As a consequence of gap junction closure, neurons become electrotonically more compact. This should increase the efficacy of chemical synaptic inputs to uncoupled neurons.

However, studying this effect of gap junctions on synaptic transmission turned out to be problematic since a major disadvantage of gap junction blockers currently available is their direct action on neurotransmitter receptors and cell membranes. Octanol, halothane as well as weak organic acids reduce excitatory synaptic transmission in the neocortex [141]. These effects are still present in more differentiated, uncoupled cells demonstrating that these substances directly affect chemical signaling. Thus, the lack of specificity of classical gap junction blockers precludes the direct analysis of interactions between the incoming chemical synaptic input and gap junctions. We therefore simulated synaptic potentials by injection of fast current transients resembling glutamatergic synaptic currents (Fig. 9). These fast electrotonic potentials were reversibly potentiated following gap junction closure. Again, these effects are absent in more differentiated, uncoupled cells [141].

The electrotonic effect is frequency dependent; the attenuation of fast electrotonic potentials is much stronger than on steady state signals. Voltage attenuation in a cable has been shown to be strongly frequency-dependent [69, 154]. Due to the low capacitive resistance at high frequencies, current leakage across the cell membrane substantially attenuates fast synaptic signals. Gap junction closure, by increasing input resistance, enlarges the amplitude and prolongs the time course of fast electrotonic potentials. The slower time course of synaptic potentials decreases the attenuation of these events. Thus, the physiological consequence of a reduction in gap junction permeability should be an increase in amplitude, and a reduction in voltage attenuation of synaptic potentials during propagation towards the cell soma. A further consequence of the prolongation of the time course of EPSPs and IPSPs is a facilitation of synaptic integration. A change in the extent of electrotonic coupling thus indirectly affects the efficacy and integration of chemical synaptic potentials. This represents an interesting regulatory mechanism affecting early circuit plasticity. These effects may be very local and may thus play a role during selective stabilization and potentiation of synaptic inputs. For example, local calcium entry via synaptic NMDA receptors or local activation of protein kinases may close gap junctions in the vicinity of the

active synapse. As a consequence, the synaptic input becomes more efficient but no longer spreads electrotonically into neighbouring neurons. Since gap junction coupling is prominent during the period of circuit formation, the regulation of neuronal electrotonic structure might be an important function of gap junctions during differentiation of synaptic circuits.

3.4. Neurotransmitter regulation of neocortical gap junctions

The extent of gap junction coupling in the neocortex certainly affects both the biochemical and physiological properties of developing neurons. An important question therefore is which physiological mechanisms might regulate

tion always results in a reduction in junctional conductance. This action has been shown in retinal horizontal and amacrine cells of various species [40,63,89,131]. Dopaminergic modulation of gap junctions via D₁ and D₂ receptors has also been described in the rat neostriatum and nucleus accumbens [26,118,116] as well as the teleost Mauthner cell [127]. The effects of the other two monoaminergic neurotransmitters, noradrenaline and serotonin, on gap junction coupling have been less frequently investigated. Monoaminergic innervation of the neocortex commences prenatally and is, particularly in the case of the dopaminergic projection, area specific. In our recent studies, we have addressed the question whether monoaminergic neurotransmitters modulate dye-coupling during the early postnatal period of neocortical development, when synaptic circuits are formed and gradual developmental uncoupling occurs (see Ref. [145] for a recent review). Within the subsequent paragraphs we will briefly summarize the results of our studies addressing the regulation of neocortical gap junctions by neurotransmitters and second messenger pathways (Fig. 10).

### 3.4.1. Dopamine

Dopaminergic afferents are predominant in a neocortical association area, the prefrontal cortex. A number of investigations indicate that monoamines, e.g., dopamine, might act as neurotrophic factors during development of the prefrontal cortex. Lesioning of dopaminergic afferents reduces cortical thickness [71] and impairs the development of cortical neurons [72]. Thus, the correct structural differentiation of the prefrontal cortex seems to require the presence of monoaminergic afferents. In rodents, two classes of dopaminergic afferents to the prefrontal cortex, originating in the A9 and A10 dopaminergic cell groups of the ventral mesencephalon have been described [9]. During the early postnatal period, dopaminergic terminals are present in both superficial and deep cortical layers [8]. The strongest expression of both D₁ and D₂ receptors occurs in the deep layers, although these receptors are also expressed in the superficial layers of prefrontal areas [147]. A significant increase in D₁ receptor expression has been observed between the second and third postnatal week when gap

late junctional communication. We have already discussed the pH sensitivity of neocortical gap junctions. Further candidates are intracellular calcium elevations and transcellular voltage changes. However, the most interesting question in view of elucidating the mechanisms guiding circuit formation in the neocortex is: to what extent do gap junctions and developing afferent projection systems interact with each other?

Neurotransmitter receptor activation modulates gap junction coupling in a multitude of cell types. The underlying mechanism in most cases is phosphorylation of the connexin subunits by various protein kinases. The best characterized pathway is the dopamine D₁ receptor modulation of gap junctional conductance. D₁ receptor activation

(C) Model for the initiation and propagation of interneuronal calcium waves underlying neuronal domains. Waves are initiated either by ambient or synaptically released glutamate (Glu; open triangles) that acts on metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR). This stimulates the G-protein (G)-phospholipase C (PLC) cascade that results in the production of inositol triphosphate (IP₃; filled circles). IP₃ activates IP₃ receptors (IP₃R; small filled ovals) and thereby causes calcium release (filled squares) from intracellular stores. In addition, IP₃ also diffuses through gap junctions (GJ) into neighboring neurons where it causes calcium release. In coupled cells, IP₃ could be regenerated by calcium-mediated positive feedback loops (dashed arrows), including the sensitization of IP₃R and stimulation of PLC.

junction coupling disappears and synaptogenesis increases [91].

In acute slices of rat neocortex, dye-coupling between superficial pyramidal neurons in the medial precentral area of the prefrontal cortex is significantly reduced following preincubation with dopamine [139]. In layers II/III this effect is observed between postnatal days 7 and 15 (P7 and P15). In contrast, at this age the majority of deep layer neurons was already uncoupled and dopamine had no significant effect on either the incidence or extent of dye-coupling. Dopamine induced uncoupling was mimicked by the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin as well as the direct protein kinase A activator, Sp-cAMPS. The protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor Rp-cAMPS antagonized the dopamine effect. Thus, uncoupling of immature pyramidal neurons by dopamine seems to involve a PKA dependent phosphorylation process. In the neocortex, the uncoupling effect of dopamine was mimicked by both the D₁ receptor agonist SKF 38393 and the D₂ receptor agonist quinpirole. Accordingly, the dopamine effect was

B

![Diagram B](attachment://diagram_b.png)

partially antagonized by the D₁ receptor blocker SCH 23390 and the D₂ receptor antagonist sulpiride [139]. Thus, dopamine induced uncoupling can be mediated by an activation of both D₁ and D₂ receptors.

We have also demonstrated second messenger and neurotransmitter induced effects on electrotonic cell properties [139, 140, 143, 144]. Activation of adenylyl cyclase by application of forskolin induced a reversible increase in input resistance and a potentiation of fast electrotonic potentials comparable to the effects observed following intracellular acidification [139]. Following incubation with either dopamine or dopamine receptor agonists, input resistance was also significantly higher as compared to control conditions. Thus, uncoupling induced by dopamine, or activation of PKA, induces similar changes in electrotonic properties as uncoupling produced by application of weak organic acid anions. In conclusion, metabolic and electrical signal transfer via gap junctions in the rodent prefrontal cortex is regulated by dopaminergic afferents. Additionally, electrotonic cell properties may be regulated by dopamine via a reduction in gap junction permeability.

### 3.4.2. Noradrenaline

The noradrenergic projections from the locus coeruleus represents another important modulatory input system to the neocortex. Noradrenaline has been shown to affect neuronal morphology, synaptogenesis and circuit formation in rat visual cortex ([49, 100, 167]; Parmavelas and Blue, 1982). Destruction of the monoaminergic innervation disturbs structural plasticity in mouse barrel cortex [120]. Noradrenergic afferents have furthermore been implicated in ocular dominance plasticity [56] and facilitation of long-term potentiation [15]. The noradrenergic innervation of the rodent neocortex begins early during ontogenesis and from P5 on, the entire rat neocortex is innervated by a noradrenergic fiber system which spreads to all cortical layers [92]. β-receptor expression increases steeply between P4 and P10 in rat neocortex and remains high during the following developmental period [101]. Thus during the early postnatal period, β-receptors are highly expressed and noradrenergic fibers have already reached their target layers. Unlike the dopaminergic projection, which is prominent only in the prefrontal and anterior cingulate areas, the noradrenergic system might modulate gap junction coupling in a large number of cortical areas.

We have recently investigated the effect of noradrenaline on gap junction coupling in rat somatosensory cortex. Dye-coupling between lamina II/III pyramidal neurons is significantly reduced following incubation with noradrenaline or the β₁ adrenoreceptor agonist isoproterenol [140]. This effect is suppressed by the β-receptor antagonist atenolol [140]. The β₁ adrenoreceptor is positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase A, suggesting that noradrenaline utilizes the same second messenger pathway as dopamine to regulate gap junctional communication. This hypothesis is confirmed by the finding that the PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMPS also antagonizes noradrenaline-induced uncoupling [143]. The monoamines dopamine and noradrenaline both downregulate gap junction coupling via activation of receptor subtypes that increase cAMP production. Since the uncoupling effect of both transmitters is blocked following inhibition of PKA and mimicked following PKA activation [139, 140], uncoupling appears to be mediated by a PKA dependent phosphorylation process. Since they converge on the same second messenger pathway, dopamine and noradrenaline might have a complementary function as regulators of gap junctional communication in different cortical areas. However, it has to be taken into consideration that the regulatory efficacy of both transmitters may differ significantly under physiological conditions. Receptor densities may be different, coupling to the intracellular transduction cascade may vary and developmental changes in modulatory functions might be different for the two projection systems.

### 3.4.3. Serotonin

A number of investigations indicates that the neuromodulator serotonin (5-HT) has a particularly important function during neocortical development. Here we will review the serotonergic modulation of neocortical gap junctions.

Fig. 10. Summary of second messenger pathways activated by neuromodulators (A) and glutamatergic inputs (B) that regulate gap junction coupling between neocortical neurons. (A) Schematic of those second messenger pathways modulating gap junction coupling that are potentially activated by G-protein-coupled monoamine receptors in neocortical neurons. Dopamine D₁ receptors, as well as β₁ adrenoceptors, converge on the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A signalling system. Serotonin receptors belonging to the 5-HT₂ class, as well as some dopamine D₂ receptors, activate phospholipase C (PLC) resulting in the hydrolysis of the membrane phospholipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) and the production of the two second messengers IP₃ and diacylglycerol (DAG). Gap junctional conductance is regulated by protein kinase A (PKA)- and protein kinase C (PKC)-mediated phosphorylation processes, as well as elevated cytosolic calcium concentrations caused, e.g., by IP₃ receptor-mediated calcium release from intracellular stores. Whether uncoupling via D₂ receptor activation is mediated by the phospholipase C pathway has so far not been demonstrated. (B) Potential pathways activated by glutamate receptor stimulation. Synaptic activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors on pyramidal neurons might regulate gap junctional conductance by calcium release from internal stores and activation of protein kinase C. On the other hand, calcium entry via NMDA receptors or calcium permeable AMPA/kainate receptors stimulates nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in interneurons. NO then activates guanylyl cyclase in pyramidal cells. The mechanism underlying the uncoupling effect of cGMP remains to be clarified; it may involve activation of a cGMP stimulated protein kinase (PKG) or it may be at least partially mediated by an indirect pathway involving inhibition of a phosphodiesterase (PDE) by cGMP. The rise in intracellular cyclic nucleotide concentrations might then result in uncoupling due to an enhanced activity of protein kinase A. Modified from Roerig and Sutor [145].

In later paragraphs, we will discuss synaptic transmission mediated by serotonin, modulatory effects of serotonin on cortical circuit responses and formation of functional maps in the visual cortex.

At neonatal stages, primary sensory areas of rodent neocortex receive a dense but transient serotonergic innervation arising in the dorsal and median raphe nuclei [36, 112, 113, 135]. This transient serotonergic hyperinnervation is temporally correlated with an elevation in cortical 5-HT levels [67]. The transient serotonergic hyperinnervation of the somatosensory cortex appears at a time when widespread gap junction coupling is observed in primary sensory areas of the developing rodent neocortex [36, 123]. Thus, the modulation of gap junctional communication between immature neurons might be one of the functions of serotonin in regulating developmental plasticity in primary sensory neocortical areas. The regulatory functions of 5-HT during neocortical development are most pronounced during the early postnatal period when synaptic circuits develop [106], and extensive gap junction coupling is still observed [123]. During this period, preincubation of cortical slices with 5-HT resulted in a significant reduction in the average number of dye-coupled cells per injection [143]. The pharmacological data so far suggest that serotonergic modulation of gap junctions is mediated by 5-HT₂ class receptors. The serotonin effect was mimicked by the 5-HT₂ receptor agonists α-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine and R(+) -1-(2, 5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI) and suppressed by the 5-HT₂ receptor antagonist ritanserin [143]. The 5-HT₂ receptors are coupled to phospholipase C stimulation and subsequent IP₃ and diacylglycerol (DAG) production [30, 37]. A rise in cytoplasmic calcium concentration to about 1 μM [90, 114] closes gap junctions. In addition, many connexins are phosphorylated by protein kinase C (PKC, [3]) which is activated by calcium and DAG. To examine the involvement of this pathway in 5-HT-mediated reduction in gap junction coupling, the whole cell patch clamp technique was used to introduce the IP₃ receptor antagonist heparin [151, 160] into the cell interior. The uncoupling effect of 5-HT was antagonized by addition of heparin to the patch pipette [143]. These results indicate that IP₃ receptor stimulation significantly contributes to the uncoupling action of 5-HT. The effect might be mediated by calcium released from intracellular stores acting directly on gap junction channels and/or by activation of PKC. The selective PKC inhibitor NPC 15437 [158] also antagonizes the effect of 5-HT on gap junction coupling [143]. Thus, activation of PKC probably contributes to the uncoupling effect of 5-HT. Calcium ions which are released from intracellular stores following 5-HT-induced IP₃ production might directly affect gap junctional conductance. Uncoupling by calcium has been described in a number of vertebrate non-neuronal tissues [18, 35, 90, 114, 115, 146] and has furthermore been shown in retinal [40] and hippocampal [134] preparations. Thus, the

uncoupling effect of 5-HT might involve a concerted action of calcium and calcium-activated PKC on neocortical gap junctions.

### 3.5. Other regulatory pathways: nitric oxide

The free radical gas nitric oxide (NO) is involved in plasticity phenomena, as well as in excitotoxicity, acting as a freely diffusing, membrane permeable messenger molecule [162]. NO production is stimulated by Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent activation of nitric oxide synthase (NOS, NADPH-diaphorase). In the neocortex, this enzyme is primarily located in GABAergic and peptidergic interneurons, whereas soluble guanylyl cyclase, the intracellular NO receptor, is found predominantly in pyramidal cells [162]. During the period of enhanced synaptic plasticity, evoked excitatory synaptic potentials in rat neocortical neurons show a larger NMDA receptor-mediated component as compared to the adult [34], and NMDA currents display slower kinetics [20]. Furthermore, fast spiking neocortical interneurons express calcium permeable AMPA receptors [70]. Calcium entry via glutamate receptors might affect gap junctional communication by calcium ions acting directly on connexons (see above). However, glutamate receptor-mediated calcium influx might also activate the NO/guanylyl cyclase pathway. Thus, these mechanisms might serve as a regulatory link between glutamatergic synaptic activity and gap junctional communication.

Dye-coupled neurons between P6 and P10 form concentric clusters around the core cell and are predominantly found in the vicinity of basal and apical dendrites of the injected neuron. Following preincubation with the nitric oxide source sodium nitroprusside (SNP), the number of coupled neurons is dramatically reduced [143]. Apart from the reduction in cluster size, a striking change in the coupling pattern occurs in many cases. A small number of neurons remain strongly dye-coupled to the injected cell. These often involve 1–3 adjacent layer II/III neurons and occasionally a single layer V neuron. The uncoupling effect of SNP is antagonized by intracellular injection of the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor cystamine, indicating that the effects of NO on dye-coupling are mediated by stimulation of guanylyl cyclase in pyramidal neurons. In compliance with these findings, both preincubation of slices with the membrane permeable cGMP analogue 8-Br-cGMP, as well as intracellular injection of cGMP resulted in a significant reduction in gap junction coupling. Increasing intracellular cGMP concentrations also mimics the change in coupling pattern observed following incubation with SNP; in many cases 1–3 cells remain strongly dye-coupled [144]. In the majority of neurons, intracellular injection of cGMP induces an increase in neuronal input resistance by about 70% [144]. This is in line with our previous observations demonstrating an increase in input resistance following uncoupling via intracellular acidification [141]. Increasing intracellular cGMP has previously been shown to reduce gap junction coupling in retinal horizontal cells

[40]. In these neurons, guanylyl cyclase is activated by the L-arginine/nitric oxide pathway, as well as by arachidonic acid (Miyachi et al., 1990) [108]. 8-Br-cGMP has also been shown to decrease the conductance of rat Cx43 gap junction channels expressed in SKHep1 cells via a phosphorylation-dependent mechanism [87]. In contrast, 8-Br-cGMP increased dye-coupling in neurons of the rat supraoptic nucleus [65].

Excitatory amino acid receptor stimulation and calcium influx increase NOS activity in cortical slices [1], and NOS-positive neurons in rat cerebral cortex express more mRNA encoding the NR1-subunit of the NMDA receptor than non-NOS neurons [132]. The number of NOS-expressing cells in the superficial layers of rat neocortex increases during the first postnatal week and thus correlates with laminar differentiation [176]. In adult rat primary sensorimotor cortex, the majority of NOS-positive cells are GABAergic local circuit neurons of layers II/III [161]; pyramidal cells express NOS only in response to cortical lesions [83]. However, soluble guanylyl cyclase, the intracellular NO receptor, is strongly expressed in pyramidal cells [162] suggesting that these neurons represent the major target for NO in the neocortex. Second messenger modulation of gap junction coupling might provide a functional link between synaptic activity and the state of metabolic and electrotonic coupling. The NO/cGMP system might thus represent an activity-dependent mechanism regulating gap junctional communication during the period of synaptic circuit formation.

### 3.6. Interactions between gap junctions and developing synaptic circuits

During the early postnatal period, gap junctions and developing chemical synaptic transmission coexist in the rodent neocortex. To what extent do these two forms of intercellular communications interact with each other, and in how far do these interactions guide or regulate the process of synaptic circuit formation in the developing neocortex? The period of circuit formation is characterized by enhanced plasticity of neocortical synapses [129]. Gap junctions could interact with these processes in a number of ways: electrical signals (at least to a small extent) can be directly transmitted via these structures [31,62], biochemical messengers regulating synaptic functions might circulate in a coupled syncytium [75–77] and, by influencing the electrotonic structure of differentiating neurons [141], gap junctions might affect the efficacy of chemical synaptic potentials. Both monoaminergic modulatory afferents, as well as glutamatergic synaptic inputs, such as the thalamocortical input trigger a multitude of regulatory mechanisms controlling gap junction permeability in the developing mammalian neocortex [145] and thus strongly interact with the gap junctional system.

However, to gain further insight into the role of gap junctions in the process of circuit formation, an understanding of the interactions of developing thalamocortical and intrinsic synaptic activity with the gap junctional system is of primary importance. In the ferret, gap junctions and spontaneous synaptic currents have been shown to gradually replace each other [74,78] (Fig. 11). In the rat, chemical and electrotonic transmission coexist at least during the first two postnatal weeks. During the early postnatal period, synaptic potentials in the neocortex are characterized by a prominent NMDA receptor-mediated component [16]. Thus, one possible interaction between glutamatergic synaptic transmission and gap junctions might be a transient occlusion of junctional channels by calcium entry via NMDA receptors or calcium-permeable AMPA/kainate receptors. These mechanisms may selectively modify the strength of synaptic inputs by the electrotonic changes induced by gap junction closure. Glutamatergic synaptic activity may also trigger neuronal coactivation via gap junctions. Kandler and Katz [77] showed that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors elicits synchronized calcium elevations (microdomains) in coupled neurons by stimulating IP₃ production and subsequent calcium release from intracellular stores. Another second messenger pathway activated by glutamate receptor-mediated calcium influx, involving the production of nitric oxide and cGMP will be discussed in more detail below.

The columnar appearance of both dye-coupled cell clusters [123] as well as gap junction-mediated calcium transients [178,179] observed in the developing neocortex has provoked the speculation that gap junction coupling of immature neurons precedes the formation of synaptic connections between the same cells. Although the apparent cell type specificity of gap junction coupling [123] argues against a preformation of the entire circuitry constituting a cortical column by the gap junctional network, the conspicuous developmental regulation of coupling points to a function during the period of synaptogenesis. Our understanding of the precise role of gap junctions during the

process of circuit formation is still incomplete. However, recent studies have shed some light on the nature of the signals transmitted via gap junctions, as well as the possible interactions between gap junctions and synaptic activity. In conclusion, the multitude of regulatory pathways we have discussed offers a variety of possible interactions between monoaminergic and glutamatergic afferents and the gap junction system. These mechanisms may comprise both short-term effects regulating metabolite transfer and electrotonic cell parameters, as well as long-term effects probably affecting connexin expression or assembly.

### 4. Development of chemical synaptic transmission in the neocortex

Having discussed the development and regulation as well as possible functions of gap junctions in the neocortex, we would like to dedicate the final chapters of this article to a brief review of chemical synaptogenesis and some of the roles of different neurotransmitters during neocortical development.

Synaptogenesis and circuit formation in the cerebral cortex can roughly be divided into two principal stages. The first stage involves the generation of neurons and glia and the migration of these neurons to their final position in the neocortex. During this time afferent and efferent fiber connections begin to form. These processes are determined mainly by activity-independent mechanisms. The second stage of development involves first spontaneous activity patterns (see above) and during later stages activity relayed via sensory afferents (see Ref. [81] for a recent review). During this period the mature synaptic circuit patterns are established.

In the embryonic cortex neurons and neuroblast predominantly communicate via gap junctions [97]. Despite the virtual absence of synaptic connections embryonic cortical cells already express neurotransmitter receptors (see Ref. [159] for a recent review), which presumably mediate neurotrophic effects of transmitter molecules. A characteristic feature of early neocortical development is the occurrence of transient cell populations [29]. Both the subplate zone, which becomes the white matter underlying the neocortex, and the marginal zone, which forms layer 1 of the adult cortex, contain cells that disappear later in development. These neurons represent temporary targets for ingrowing axons before these innervate the cortex. The disappearance of these cells is correlated with ingrowing of thalamic and callosal axons and with the elimination of synapses from the subplate.

Postnatally, synaptic transmission is dominated by excitatory synaptic potentials [159]. Early in development excitatory postsynaptic potentials are dominated by an NMDA receptor mediated component [20], which is gradually reduced in an activity dependent manner. Gabaergic synaptic transmission develops delayed, and early GABAergic potentials are excitatory in nature (Luhmann and Prince,

1991). With the maturation of ion gradients and chloride transport mechanisms, GABAergic inputs become inhibitory.

The majority of studies addressing the development of synaptic transmission in the neocortex have been done in rodents where fast chemical transmission appears to be mediated exclusively by glutamate and GABA. However, in the developing ferret visual cortex we have recently discovered synaptic transmission mediated by acetylcholine and serotonin [137]. These 'modulatory' transmitters have been presumed to act predominantly through second messenger-coupled receptors. However, acetylcholine and serotonin also act on ligand-gated ion channels; the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor and the serotonin 5-HT₃ receptor, respectively. We were able to pharmacologically isolate fast, spontaneous and evoked cholinergic and serotonergic synaptic events in pyramidal cells and interneurons of all cortical layers (Fig. 12). The number of cells receiving cholinergic and serotonergic inputs increased with the ingrowth of thalamic afferents and the frequencies of the spontaneous events increased at eye opening. The early onset and the striking developmental regulation of cholinergic and serotonergic transmission suggests a role during initial stages of circuit formation and during subsequent experience-dependent remodeling of cortical connections.

#### 4.1. Neuromodulators in developing synaptic circuits

Beginning at embryonic stages, the mammalian neocortex is densely innervated by cholinergic, serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic brainstem afferents. Their early presence in developing cortical circuits suggests roles for these transmitters in circuit formation and synaptogenesis. Indeed, a multitude of different effects of these transmitters on the structural and functional differentiation as well as the adult performance of neocortical circuits has already been demonstrated. In this article, we have discussed the various pathways used by these afferents to regulate gap junctions between cortical neurons. We have also mentioned the role of acetylcholine and serotonin in mediating fast transmission in the developing ferret primary visual cortex. Finally, we would like to review briefly the effects of neuromodulators on chemical synaptic transmission.

During early postnatal development, serotonergic fibers and thalamocortical axon arborizations in the rat primary somatosensory cortex show a parallel anatomical organization [51,82,93,135]. The differentiation of this characteristic organization of serotonergic afferents requires the presence of thalamocortical axons [5,7] and disappears by the end of the second postnatal week [5,7,135]. The close anatomical alignment of serotonergic and thalamocortical fiber systems suggests a functional role for 5-HT during the formation or refinement of thalamocortical projections in primary sensory areas. Thus, vibrissa-related thalamo-

(A) Spontaneous cholinergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the ferret visual cortex. Synaptic events were recorded from a P22 layer 5 pyramidal neuron in the presence of GABA and glutamate receptor antagonists. These events were abolished by the selective nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE, 100 μM). (B) Spontaneous serotonergic EPSCs recorded from a layer 4 interneuron. Synaptic currents were blocked by bath application of the 5-HT₃ receptor antagonist ICS 205-930. The proportion of neurons receiving fast excitatory cholinergic or serotonergic inputs changes with postnatal age. A larger fraction of tested cells showed cholinergic EPSCs compared with serotonergic events during the entire developmental period investigated. (C,D) The percentage of cells showing these events increased after P14, which corresponds to the ingrowth of thalamic afferents. The mean frequencies of both spontaneous cholinergic and serotonergic EPSCs increased after P30 (E,F), i.e., after eye opening. *N*, Number of cells included; error bars represent S.E.M. Spontaneous activity was recorded for a period of several minutes in the presence of glutamate and GABA receptor antagonists, and synaptic events were pharmacologically identified by subsequent addition of DHβE and ICS in each cell included in the plots. Modified from Roerig and Katz [137].

cortical terminations in the rodent barrel cortex are reduced in size following depletion of 5-HT by 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine (5,7-DHT)-injections [5,7]. Furthermore, Gu and Singer [59] have shown that depletion of serotonergic terminals, or infusion of serotonin receptor antagonists, reduce ocular dominance plasticity in kitten visual cortex. These results suggest an important role of the serotonergic system in primary sensory map formation in the developing neocortex. One of the primary mechanism underlying the regulation of developmental plasticity by 5-HT is a modulation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission. Recent electrophysiological studies have demonstrated a presynaptic suppression of thalamocortical transmission in rat somatosensory cortex by 5-HT [136], involving 5-HT₁b receptors located on thalamocortical axons [6].

We have recently studied the effects of serotonergic and cholinergic agonists on circuit responses during postnatal development of ferret visual cortex [138]. To investigate the effects of ionotropic acetylcholine and serotonin receptor stimulation on the spatiotemporal behaviour of cortical circuits we combined high-speed optical imaging of voltage sensitive dye signals and whole cell patch clamp recordings from single neurons (Fig. 13). Activation of 5-HT₃ receptors by selective agonists decreased the amplitude and lateral extent of excitation throughout postnatal development. This effect peaks after eye opening, which indicates a function for serotonergic modulation of circuit responses during the period of refinement of cortical connections. Whole cell patch clamp recordings from single neurons revealed that synaptic responses evoked by white

matter stimulation were reduced by 5-HT₃ receptor agonists, whereas the frequency of spontaneous GABAergic synaptic currents was dramatically enhanced. This indicates that the modulation of spontaneous synaptic activity by fast-acting serotonin receptors is reflected in an inhibition of the circuit response, in line with the notion of background synaptic activity altering the spatiotemporal integration properties of cortical cells by changing their membrane potential and their electrotonic structure. These mechanisms may regulate the response properties of intrinsic circuits in both the adult and developing neocortex.

The effects of cholinergic agonists were less uniform [142]; inhibition of circuit responses was observed in the majority of cases but excitatory effects were also observed in a significant number of preparations. Accordingly, whole cell patch clamp recordings showed increases in GABAergic or glutamatergic background activity following application of cholinergic agonists.

### 4.2. Serotonin and cortical map formation

A large number of studies suggest that the neuromodulator serotonin plays a particularly important role during cortical development. In the final sections of this article we would like to discuss experimental evidence for a function of serotonin in setting up the basic layout of functional maps in the somatosensory and visual cortex.

#### 4.2.1. Physiological actions of serotonin in the visual cortex

As mentioned earlier, serotonergic fibers invade the developing cortex very early and the expression pattern of serotonin receptors is controlled by afferent activity [58]. A number of studies demonstrate a multitude of regulatory functions of the neuromodulator serotonin during development of cortical circuits, including regulation of gap junction coupling [144], modulation of synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity [44,45,138,85]. In addition, the ionotropic 5-HT₃ receptor can mediate fast transmission in the ferret visual cortex [137]. Application of 5-HT in vivo has been shown to have acute effects on neuronal firing behaviour and receptive field properties [166]. A high density of labelling and a distinct pattern of 5-HT₁ receptor sites in the primary visual cortex also suggest an important role of serotonergic transmission in the modulation of

visual afferent input activity [150]. All these studies suggest a variety of possible mechanisms by which serotonin can effect circuit functioning and development.

#### 4.2.2. Columnar systems and serotonergic markers

There are several reports indicating a role of the serotonergic system in the formation of cortical columns and functional maps. Wang et al. [165] have investigated the role of serotonin-2C (5-HT₂C) receptors in modulation of ocular dominance plasticity in kitten visual cortex. Their data suggest that the 5-HT₂C receptor system may be involved in the formation and modification of ocular dominance columns in the developing visual cortex. Since activation of 5-HT₂ receptors stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis, these data suggest that second messengers from the phospholipid pathway may play an important role in developmental plasticity of the visual cortex. Dyck and Cynader [43] also described an interdigitated mosaic of four neuroactive molecules demarcating two distinct columnar systems in the kitten visual cortex. Serotonin 1C receptors and synaptic zinc were found to delineate columns within layer IV of kitten visual cortex. These were interdigitated with a second, patchy system characterized by increased levels of cytochrome oxidase and acetylcholinesterase. These findings indicate that biochemical cues may play a substantial role in establishing the functional organization of columnar systems in the mammalian visual cortex.

The same authors analyzed postnatal changes in the distribution of 5-HT receptor subtypes in the visual cortex of cats. Although specific labeling of 5-HT₃ receptors was not detected in the cat visual cortex at any age, each of the remaining 5-HT receptor subtypes exhibited unique temporal, regional, and laminar patterns of expression in visual cortical areas 17, 18, and 19 and lateral suprasylvian cortex (LS). 5-HT₁A receptors were the earliest to demonstrate visual cortex-specific changes in expression. They exhibited peak levels of expression in all visual cortical areas, predominantly in supra- and infragranular layers, between P10 and P30. Their levels in all areas declined progressively with increasing age. 5-HT₁C receptors demonstrated their highest levels of expression in the deeper half of layer IV, but only in area 17, between P40 and P75. The most striking feature of their distribution throughout this period was that, in layer IV and extending

Fig. 13. Modulation of cortical circuit responses by serotonergic agonists. Optical recording of voltage sensitive dye signals was used to monitor the spatiotemporal modulation of circuit behaviour on a network level. (A) Maximum amplitude plots derived from optically recorded traces showing the effect of serotonin on cortical circuit activation. Serotonin (100 μM) was bath applied. The circuit was activated by electrical stimulation in layer 4. Recordings were made from a coronal slice from a P29 animal. Serotonin reversibly reduced the amplitude of the excitatory response. (B) Bath application of M-109, an agonist at the ionotropic 5-HT₃ receptor, also reversibly reduced cortical circuit activation. (D–F) The mechanism underlying the reduction in cortical circuit responses following activation of serotonin 5-HT₃ receptors is an increase in GABAergic synaptic activity. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were made from a layer 2/3 pyramidal cell in a coronal slice from a P26 ferret. Bath application of the 5-HT₃ receptor agonist M-109 dramatically increased the frequency of GABAergic synaptic events. (G) Time course of the frequency increase induced by M-109.

into layer III, the 5-HT<sub>1c</sub> receptors were concentrated in columns that were 400 microns wide and had a center-to-center spacing of about 900 microns. This transient pattern of expression was not present beyond P90. 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors were most densely expressed in layer IV between P40 and P120, but they displayed a distinctly different distribution pattern. The densest binding of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors was limited to the upper half of layer IV and found in areas 17, 18, and LS. The distribution of layer 5-HT<sub>2</sub> receptors along the dense band in layer IV of area 17 was discontinuous, exhibiting patches that were found in the same vertical columns as were the 5-HT<sub>1c</sub> receptors. Interestingly, the different distribution patterns of 5-HT<sub>2</sub> and 5-HT<sub>1c</sub> receptors correspond to X- and Y-afferent zones, suggesting a role for serotonin receptors in setting up spatial frequency columns.

In rodents columnar aggregates are also delineated by serotonergic afferents [112]. Serotonergic fibers form transient dense aggregations in all rat primary sensory areas during early postnatal development. In the normal rat visual cortex, there are three stages in the transient aggregation of serotonin immunoreactive fibers from P2 to P15. Primary aggregates appear in the subplate prior to the differentiation of layer IV, and move upward to the lower layer of the cortical plate to form secondary aggregates. Secondary aggregations give rise to ascending fibers on the cortical surface which are roughly grouped in columns (tertiary aggregation). The serotonin fibers of the tertiary aggregates are arranged in a lattice-like pattern in layer I, and are significantly altered either in size of distribution area or column number after monocular or binocular enucleation. This lattice-like pattern of serotonin innervation in neonatal rats may be an evolutionary precursor of the “blobs” seen in primate visual cortex.

### 4.2.3. Effects of alterations of the serotonergic system

Recently, a transgenic mouse model has been developed in which cortical serotonin levels are increased [22]. A line of transgenic mice was isolated in which transgene integration caused a deletion in the gene encoding MAOA, providing an animal model of MAOA deficiency. In pup brains, serotonin concentrations were increased up to ninefold, and serotonin-like immunoreactivity was present in catecholaminergic neurons. In pup and adult brains, noradrenaline concentrations were increased up to twofold, and cytoarchitectural changes were observed in the somatosensory cortex.

In this transgenic mouse line (Tg8), Cases et al. [23] showed that the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) lacks the characteristic barrel-like clustering of layer IV neurons, whereas normal pattern formation exists in the thalamus and the trigeminal nuclei. No barrel-like patterns were visible with tenascin or serotonin immunostaining or with labeling of thalamocortical axons. An excess of brain serotonin during the critical period of barrel formation appears to have a causal role in these cortical abnormalities, since early administration of parachlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of serotonin synthesis, in Tg8 pups restored the formation of barrels in S1, whereas inhibition of catecholamine synthesis did not. Transient inactivation of MAOA in normal newborns using the irreversible MAOA inhibitor chlorphylamine reproduced a barrel-less phenotype in parts of S1. These results strongly suggest that the organization of the thalamocortical input is severely disturbed in excess serotonin animals.

Depletion of cortical serotonin, on the other hand, has also been shown to seriously affect cortical development [119]. Serotonin depletion also delays the formation of barrels in the rat somatosensory cortex. Newborn mice were treated with selective neurotoxins (6-hydroxydopamine or 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine) at birth to destroy the catecholaminergic and monoaminergic cortical innervation, respectively. Compared with the controls, delayed growth and differentiation of the cortical layers II–IV were observed in the treated animals. From the third postnatal week, no cytoarchitectonic difference could be detected. Although neonatal depletion of the cortical monoaminergic innervation does not affect the laminar organization of the adult mouse barrelfield, it significantly delays the time-course of development of several cortical layers. This delay generates a mismatch in the degree of maturation between cortical neurons and their afferents at a time when neuronal interactions are critical for the establishment of local circuitry.

Till now investigations addressing the relationship between the serotonergic system and cortical functional architecture have been largely limited to immunocytochemical or other anatomical techniques, no physiological testing of the effects of interfering with serotonergic transmission on the development of either cortical maps or intrinsic circuits has been done so far. Since the hyper-5-HT phenotype of the MAOA knockout mouse model [23] can be pharmacologically imitated by repetitive injection of the irreversible MAOA inhibitor chlorphylamine we developed a

Images are taken from the occipital pole of the brain, caudal is to the left, cranial to the right. The imaged region includes the primary visual cortex and parts of the adjacent area 18. Top panels show examples of differential images recorded during stimulation with two different orientation pairs (0/90° and 45/135°), as indicated by bars on top of panels. These images are generated by subtracting responses towards orthogonal stimuli and dividing by an image of the unstimulated cortex (blank). Active areas appear as black zones. The lower panel shows the blood vessel reference image. Whereas in the control animal prominent iso-orientation domains are visible, orientation specific responses are almost completely abolished in the treated animal.

preliminary data show that chronically elevated intracortical serotonin concentrations can severely disrupt the development of orientation and direction preference maps recorded using optical imaging based on intrinsic signals in vivo (Fig. 14). This is confirmed by a deterioration of receptive field properties determined using extracellular single unit recording (Fig. 15). Based on Dyck and Cynader’s finding that 5-HT receptor expression patterns correlate with X- and Y-cell geniculocortical inputs, it will be particularly intriguing to analyze the development of spatial frequency tuning under conditions of increased serotonin concentrations. The mechanisms underlying our own findings on orientation tuning in the ferret visual cortex as well as the disturbance of the segregation of thalamocortical afferents in the rodent barrel field described by Cases et al. [23] are completely unclear. Growth related mechanisms, effects on receptor expression, activity patterns and modulation of synaptic transmission may all be involved. Although a lot of effort is still required to elucidate the mechanisms underlying all these observations, we can be reasonably confident that the serotonergic system substantially contributes to the emergence of cortical functional architecture during development.
