The Hippo pathway, a signaling cascade that controls cell cycle progression, apoptosis and cell differentiation, has emerged as a fundamental regulator of many physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies have revealed a complex network of interactions directing Hippo pathway activity, and have connected this pathway with other key signaling pathways. Such crosstalk has uncovered novel roles for Hippo signaling, including regulation of TGFβ/SMAD and WNT/β-catenin pathways. This review highlights some of the recent findings in the Hippo field with an emphasis on how the Hippo pathway is integrated with other pathways to mediate diverse processes.

## Introduction

Animal development requires the coordinated action of different cellular activities that direct events such as replication, movement and cell fate decisions. This is largely achieved by intra- and inter-cellular communication via signal transduction pathways. Although classical genetic screening has been a powerful tool for dissecting these signaling pathways, advances in genomics and proteomics over the past decade have streamlined many screening techniques to system-wide levels. This has blurred the once linear pathways into a complex network of signaling interactions.

As data emerge, one pathway that appears vital in coordinating the complex networks of signals with that of a cell’s surrounding environment is the Hippo pathway. Genetic screens searching for tumor suppressors in *Drosophila melanogaster* allowed for the mapping of this pathway, and implicated the Hippo pathway in growth control regulation and organ size determination (Justice *et al.*, 1995; Kango-Singh *et al.*, 2002;

Tapon *et al.*, 2002; Harvey *et al.*, 2003; Jia *et al.*, 2003; Pantalacci *et al.*, 2003; Udan *et al.*, 2003; Wu *et al.*, 2003). As genetic studies in the fly were mapping pathway architecture, biochemical and developmental studies from mammalian models were dissecting protein functions and revealing their significance in the progression of diseases like cancer (Sudol, 1994; Justice *et al.*, 1995; St John *et al.*, 1999; Tao *et al.*, 1999; Kanai *et al.*, 2000). The complementary nature of these fields has allowed for the rapid progression in the understanding of Hippo pathway dynamics and its relevance to global signaling. Indeed, many studies have revealed crosstalk between the Hippo pathway and other key signaling pathways, thereby providing crucial links between cell communication and cell growth. The importance of cell-cell contacts in the regulation of the Hippo pathway has also been realized, thus, providing a clear ‘junction’ between inter- and intra-cellular signaling.

### The Hippo pathway

The Hippo pathway was delineated from genetic screens in *D. melanogaster* searching for suppressors of tissue growth. These screens identified three pathway components, including two kinases, Hippo (Hpo) and Warts (Wts), and the scaffolding protein Salvador (Sav) (Justice *et al.*, 1995; Tapon *et al.*, 2002; Harvey *et al.*, 2003; Jia *et al.*, 2003; Pantalacci *et al.*, 2003; Udan *et al.*, 2003; Wu *et al.*, 2003). Mob-as-tumor-suppressor (Mats) was identified shortly after as another component of the Hippo pathway (Lai *et al.*, 2005). Mutation of any of these genes results in overgrown and enlarged tissues and organs, inspiring the imaginative name for the pathway. These proteins propagate a cascade of phosphorylation events (reviewed in Pan (2010); Zhao *et al.* (2010a)), with Sav and Mats mediating complex formation between Hpo and Wts, resulting in Hpo phosphorylating and activating Wts. This leads to active Wts phosphorylating the transcriptional regulator Yorkie (Yki). Phosphorylated Yki is competent to bind 14-3-3 proteins, which function to retain Yki in the cytoplasm and consequently inhibit Yki nuclear functions.

The Hippo pathway is well conserved in mammals, however, as is often the case, a higher level of complexity exists (Figure 1). In humans and mice, the pathway consists of the MST1 and MST2 kinases (homologs of Hpo), which phosphorylate and activate the LATS1 and LATS2 kinases (homologs of Wts). LATS1/2 kinases phosphorylate the transcriptional regulators TAZ (also known as WWTR1) and YAP (homologs of Yki).

Figure 1 Illustration of the mammalian Hippo pathway. Central to the pathway are the transcriptional regulators TAZ and YAP. Nuclear TAZ and YAP associate with a number of DNA-binding transcription factors to mediate their transcriptional activity, including the TEAD and SMAD families. In a relatively unclear manner, upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway activate the MST1/2 kinases, which phosphorylate and activate the LATS1/2 kinases. LATS1/2 then phosphorylate TAZ and YAP, leading to their binding to 14-3-3 proteins and subsequent cytoplasmic sequestration. In the cytoplasm, TAZ and YAP perform an array of functions, including binding to SMAD7 and TGFβ-activated SMAD complexes interfering with TGFβ signaling. Cytoplasmic TAZ also binds DVL proteins to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Insight into the mammalian components was gained long before the pathway was outlined. Initial studies implicated the mammalian components in diverse processes. For example, MST1 and MST2 were identified as inducers of apoptosis (Graves et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2001), whereas LATS1 and LATS2 were initially identified as regulators of cell cycle progression (Tao et al., 1999; Hori et al., 2000). YAP was identified as a Yes tyrosine kinase-associated protein (Sudol, 1994) and as the first WW domain-containing protein (Sudol et al., 1995), and TAZ was identified as a transcriptional co-activator regulated by 14-3-3 proteins (Kanai et al., 2000). Subsequent studies have revealed that, as in *D. melanogaster*, these proteins function together in a pathway that culminates in the regulation of TAZ/YAP localization and transcriptional activity (reviewed in Pan, 2010; Zhao et al., 2010a) (Figure 1).

TAZ/YAP localization, and hence activity, directs their interactions with a wide array of proteins, which range from DNA-binding transcription factors to cell-polarity-regulating proteins (summarized in Figure 2). TAZ/YAP localization is largely mediated by interactions with 14-3-3 proteins (Kanai et al., 2000; Basu et al., 2003). These interactions are promoted by LATS1/2-induced phosphorylation of TAZ/YAP (Dong et al., 2007; Lei et al., 2008). The primary site of phosphorylation mediating 14-3-3 binding is Serine 89 within human TAZ, and Serine 127 within human YAP. Mutation of these sites enhances the nuclear localization of TAZ and YAP, and therefore their transcriptional activity (Kanai et al., 2000; Basu et al., 2003). Several other phosphosites contribute to TAZ/YAP localization, including a phospho-degron motif that is primed by LATS kinases and further modified by Casein Kinase 1 δ/ε kinases. Such phosphorylation results in the ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation of TAZ and YAP (Liu et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2010b). Recently, another mode of TAZ/YAP regulation was

Figure 2 Summary of TAZ and YAP protein interactions. The known binding partners of TAZ and YAP are illustrated, with those that are common to both TAZ and YAP depicted in the middle in red and those that are unique to either TAZ or YAP depicted in green. Transcription factors are highlighted with either a dark red (those binding to both TAZ and YAP) or dark green color (those exclusive to TAZ or YAP).

revealed showing that TAZ/YAP localization is also controlled by cellular mechano-sensory cues (Dupont *et al.*, 2011). This regulation is dependent on the activity of RhoGTPase proteins and the actin cytoskeleton, which respond to stimulus provided by physical tension. Upon high cytoskeleton tension, TAZ and YAP localize to the nucleus, whereas at low tension, TAZ and YAP localize to the cytoplasm. Interestingly, this regulatory mechanism is suggested to function independent of LATS1/2 kinase activity. Thus, multiple means exist to control TAZ/YAP localization and function.

TAZ/YAP possess a strong transcriptional activation domain (Yagi *et al.*, 1999; Kanai *et al.*, 2000), and when localized to the nucleus can regulate transcription of a number of genes. However, TAZ/YAP do not bind DNA directly, but rather function as transcriptional co-activators by means of physical interactions with a range of transcription factors (Figure 2). Many of these interactions rely on the WW domain of TAZ/YAP (reviewed in Hong and Yaffe (2006); Sudol (2011)). The WW domain is a motif of ~40 amino acid with conserved tryptophan and proline residues (Rotin, 1998). This domain recognizes proline-rich modules known as PY motifs found in various proteins (reviewed

in Sudol *et al.* (2001)). Different isoforms of TAZ and YAP exist that possess either one or two WW domains, and this has been shown to provide differential activity (Komuro *et al.*, 2003; Webb *et al.*, 2011). Some of the TAZ/YAP nuclear DNA-binding partners that interact with the WW domain include RUNX1, RUNX2, p73, PAX3, PAX8, TTF-1 (also known as NKX2.1), TBX5 (also known as NKX2.5), PPARY and SMAD1 (Strano *et al.*, 2001; Cui *et al.*, 2003; Park *et al.*, 2004; Murakami *et al.*, 2005, 2006; Hong and Yaffe, 2006; Alarcon *et al.*, 2009; Di Palma *et al.*, 2009). TAZ/YAP possess additional domains that are important for transcription factor binding, including a coiled-coil domain that facilitates interactions with the TGFβ-regulated SMADs (Varelas *et al.*, 2008), and an N-terminal domain that binds to the TEAD family of transcription factors (Vassilev *et al.*, 2001; Zhao *et al.*, 2008). Studies have suggested that the role for TAZ/YAP in driving cell proliferation is mediated primarily by the TEAD transcription factors (Zhao *et al.*, 2008; Chan *et al.*, 2009). Therefore, given the influential role that TEAD proteins have in cell proliferation, along with the critical cellular processes regulated by other TAZ/YAP-mediated transcription factors, it is not surprising
that TAZ/YAP function as conduits to cellular transformation.

There is ample evidence that the Hippo pathway kinases have a key role in restraining nuclear TAZ/YAP activity. However, how these kinases are activated and recruited to TAZ/YAP is poorly understood. Several core members and upstream regulators of the Hippo pathway have been identified through genetic studies in *D. melanogaster*, all of which, when mutated, result in tissue overgrowth. These include, the FERM domain proteins Merlin and Expanded, the WW-domain proteins Sav and Kibra, the Wts regulator Mats, the atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous, and the transmembrane polarity-regulator Crumbs (reviewed in Pan (2010)). The Hippo pathway is largely conserved in mammals with many of the homologous proteins exhibiting similar functions (Figure 1). Although some homologs, such as Fat and Dachsous, have yet to be linked to regulation of the mammalian Hippo pathway, other regulators have been identified only in mammals, including important mediators of polarity, such as the Crumbs complex-associated proteins PALS1, Angiomotin (AMOT) and the adherens junction-associated protein α-catenin (Varelas et al., 2010b; Schlegelmilch et al., 2011; Silvis et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2011). There is accumulating evidence that cell-cell contacts mediate the association of these proteins and drive Hippo pathway activation.

### The Hippo pathway in development and cancer

Genetic studies in *D. melanogaster* and mice have described the Hippo pathway as a crucial regulator of development. This is underscored by the severe phenotypes associated with ablation of TAZ and/or YAP genes. Deletion of YAP in mice results in embryonic lethality at approximately E8.5 with defects in yolk sac vasculogenesis, chorioallantoic attachment and embryonic elongation (Morin-Kensicki et al., 2006). TAZ-deleted mice develop severe polycystic kidneys and emphysematous changes in their lungs, resulting in incompletely penetrant embryonic lethality (Hossain et al., 2007; Tian et al., 2007; Makita et al., 2008). The differences in TAZ or YAP deletion phenotypes may be attributed to differences in their expression and/or regulation, as both proteins clearly perform redundant functions essential for animal development. This is highlighted by the striking phenotype of the TAZ/YAP double-knockout mice, which fail to develop past the 16–32-cell stage before embryo implantation (Nishioka et al., 2009). This severe phenotype can be credited in large part to the role that TAZ/YAP has in regulating the activity of the TEAD transcription factors, which at this stage mediate cell fate decisions important for progression of cells to a trophectoderm fate. TEAD activity is regulated by TAZ/YAP localization; as cells of the developing embryo increase in population, inner cells become more compacted than outer cells, and at the morula stage a clear distinction in the localization of TAZ/YAP is observed. The less compacted outer cells display prominent nuclear TAZ/YAP and increased TEAD4 activity, whereas the inner cells display cytoplasmic TAZ/YAP and eventually give rise to OCT4-expressing cells in the blastocyst known at the inner cell mass (Nishioka et al., 2009). Thus, the Hippo pathway provides a means for the local cell environment to relay signals that subsequently impact on cell fate decisions.

Examples of Hippo pathway regulation of stem cell fate decisions are recurring, and many studies suggest that nuclear TAZ/YAP have key roles in the maintenance of stem cells populations. For example, TAZ and YAP are required for human and mouse embryonic stem cells, respectively, to maintain their *in vitro* pluripotent characteristics (Varelas et al., 2008; Alarcon et al., 2009; Lian et al., 2010). Furthermore, propagation of somatic stem cell populations, such as those of the skin and intestine, requires YAP activity (Schlegelmilch et al., 2011; Zhang et al., 2011). Interestingly, when intestinal YAP levels are increased in an inducible transgenic mouse model there is an expansion of undifferentiated progenitor cells, concurrent with deregulated Wnt and Notch pathway activity (Camargo et al., 2007), suggesting crosstalk between these pathways.

The capacity of TAZ/YAP to direct cell proliferation and stem cell fate decisions provides these proteins with potent oncogenic potential. Indeed, overexpression of TAZ or YAP in mammary epithelial cells, particularly mutants of TAZ/YAP that localize in the nucleus, results in cell transformation and the acquisition of tumor-forming ability (Overholtzer et al., 2006; Dong et al., 2007; Chan et al., 2008). This activity is dependent on the ability of TAZ/YAP to interact with the TEAD family of transcription factors (Zhao et al., 2008; Chan et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009a). Consistent with the ability of nuclear TAZ/YAP to induce tumors, conditional overexpression of YAP (Dong et al., 2007), or genetic ablation of MST1/2 in mouse livers results in hepatocellular carcinomas (Zhou et al., 2009; Lu et al., 2010; Song et al., 2010). Furthermore, a wide range of cancers display high levels of TAZ or YAP expression that correlates with their nuclear localization (reviewed in Zhao et al. (2010a)). The levels of LATS or MST kinases are also decreased in various cancers, likely as a result of LATS and MST promoter hypermethylation (Jimenez-Velasco et al., 2005; Takahashi et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2006; Seidel et al., 2007; Steinmann et al., 2009). Interestingly, increased TAZ/YAP transcriptional activity results in the acquisition of oncogenic cellular properties, including those of an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Overholtzer et al., 2006; Lei et al., 2008). Many of these events resemble those augmented by other signaling pathways, suggesting that synergistic crosstalk with TAZ/YAP may have a crucial role in cancer progression.

### TAZ and YAP mediate TGFβ/SMAD-regulated transcription

Over the past several years, evidence has accumulated that the Hippo pathway has an important role in regulating TGFβ/SMAD signaling. Various mechanisms of action have been uncovered.
Members of the TGFβ superfamily (TGFβs, activins, BMPs, GDFs) signal via heteromeric serine/threonine kinase transmembrane receptor complexes. Binding of the ligand to its primary (type II) receptor, a constitutively active kinase, allows the recruitment, transphosphorylation and activation of the signaling (type I) receptor. The latter is able to exert its phosphorylation-dependent serine-threonine kinase activity to phosphorylate members of the SMAD family of proteins (Javelaud and Mauviel, 2004). Receptor-activated SMADs (R-SMADs) are ligand-specific: SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8 are phosphorylated by the BMP receptors, while SMAD2 and SMAD3 (SMAD2/3) are activated by both TGFβ and activin receptors (Figure 1). Structurally, R-SMADs consist of two conserved globular Mad homology (MH) domains separated by a linker region (Shi and Massague, 2003). The N-terminal MH1 domain is involved predominantly in DNA binding, while the C-terminal MH2 domain has protein-binding properties. Phosphorylation of R-SMADs by type I receptors occurs principally on serine residues within a C-terminal conserved SS(M/V)S motif, leading to heteromeric complex formation with SMAD4, a common mediator for all SMAD pathways. These heterocomplexes accumulate in the nucleus and regulate target gene expression (Javelaud and Mauviel, 2004). Following transcription, SMAD complexes are released from chromatin and either undergo ubiquitination followed by proteasomal degradation (reviewed in Wang, 2003), and/or dephosphorylation by nuclear phosphatases (Dai et al., 2010). This results in termination of TGFβ signaling, and/or shuttling of SMADs out of the nucleus for de novo phosphorylation (Xiao et al., 2001; Penheiter et al., 2002; Di Guglielmo et al., 2003; Nicolas et al., 2004).

Another subclass of SMADs, which are known as the inhibitory SMADs, function as antagonists of TGFβ signaling. This subclass is made up of SMAD7, which inhibits both TGFβ and BMP/activin receptor signaling, and SMAD6, which specifically inhibits the BMP/activin receptors (Wrana, 2000; Massague et al., 2005). SMAD7 regulates SMAD signaling by various mechanisms. SMAD7 prevents R-SMAD-receptor interactions by inhibiting R-SMAD phosphorylation. SMAD7 also deactivates TGFβ receptors by promoting their dephosphorylation, as well as recruiting the action of ubiquitin-ligases that target TGFβ receptor complexes for proteasome-mediated degradation (Hayashi et al., 1997; Kavsak et al., 2000; Ebisawa et al., 2001; Zhang et al., 2001; Shi and Massague, 2003). SMAD6 prevents SMAD1/5/8 phosphorylation by BMP receptors and may also prevent association of SMAD1 with SMAD4, consequently interrupting BMP signaling (Imamura et al., 1997; Hata et al., 1998).

Initial evidence for Hippo pathway association with TGFβ pathway members came from a yeast two-hybrid screen searching for SMAD7-binding proteins using a human placental complementary DNA expression library. YAP binding was observed with SMAD7, but not with SMAD6, indicating specificity among these inhibitory SMADs. YAP binding to SMAD7 is partially

Hippo signaling in context  
A Mauviel et al  

mediated by the PY motif of SMAD7, as mutation of this motif reduces the interaction between the two proteins. This suggests that the YAP WW domain, along with an as yet uncharacterized region, has a role in the SMAD7 interaction. YAP was shown to promote the recruitment of SMAD7 to a constitutively active TGFβ receptor I, thereby augmenting the repressive role that SMAD7 has in mediating SMAD3/4-driven transcription (Ferrigno et al., 2002). Hence, these data identified YAP as a SMAD7-binding partner with the potential to repress TGFβ/SMAD signaling.

A more multifaceted role for the Hippo pathway in TGFβ signaling was revealed from systematic protein interaction screens that were focused on identifying binding partners for core components of the TGFβ signaling pathway (Barrios-Rodiles et al., 2005). These screens revealed that SMAD2 and SMAD3 interact with TAZ (Figure 1). A more detailed examination of these interactions demonstrated that TAZ binds heteromeric SMAD2/3/4 complexes in the presence of TGFβ (Varelas et al., 2008). In response to TGFβ stimulation, TAZ-bound SMAD complexes are recruited to TGFβ response elements of target genes, including those of Smad7 and Pai-1 (Figure 1). Although TAZ knockdown markedly reduces TGFβ-mediated transcription, it does not interfere with TGFβ-dependent phosphorylation of SMAD2/3 and formation of R-SMAD/SMAD4 heterocomplexes. This indicates TAZ functions downstream of complex formation in propagating TGFβ-induced SMAD signals. One noteworthy binding partner of TAZ is the mediator/ARC complex component ARC105 (also known as MED15) (Varelas et al., 2008), a known binding partner of SMAD2/3 (Kato et al., 2002). Co-expression of ARC105 with TAZ results in redistribution of both proteins within the nucleus, which together with SMADs colocalize with Tri-methyl-K4-Histone H3, which marks active gene transcription (Santos-Rosa et al., 2002; Schneider et al., 2004). This suggests that TAZ may have a role in recruiting basal transcriptional machinery to SMAD-regulated transcriptional elements. Consistent with a role in regulating SMAD-mediated transcription, TAZ knockdown in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) results in neuroectodermal differentiation and loss of the hESC pluripotency markers Oct4 and Nanog, an effect similar to that obtained upon TGFβ receptor inhibition (Varelas et al., 2008). Thus, nuclear TAZ promotes SMAD activity and has a key role in stem cell regulation.

In addition to TGFβ, a subsequent study showed that YAP interaction with SMAD proteins affects nuclear BMP signaling (Alarcon et al., 2009). YAP associates with SMAD1/5 in a BMP-dependent manner (Figure 1). This interaction is critical for BMP-induced gene expression, as YAP depletion prevents BMP-driven Smad7 and Id1 expression. This study also implicated the ARC/mediator complex in SMAD regulation showing a key role for mediator-associated kinases CDK8/9 in phosphorylating the linker domain of SMAD1. It was found that linker phosphorylation regulates SMAD1 protein stability via interactions with
HECT domain ubiquitin ligases. Linker phosphorylation of SMAD1 also stimulates interaction with YAP, which functions to promote BMP-mediated transcriptional signals. Therefore, it is proposed that linker phosphorylation serves to regulate cycles of SMAD activation and subsequent degradation (Alarcon *et al.*, 2009). More recently, the mechanisms that couple the delivery of TGFβ and BMP signals to SMADs were further dissected. It was found that SMAD activation, and subsequent destruction, is controlled by sequential phosphorylation events within the SMAD linker domain, which facilitates the binding of distinct WW domain-containing proteins. Phosphorylation by CDK8/9 kinases recruits YAP or Pin1 to promote SMAD-mediated transcription, and subsequent phosphorylation by GSK3 kinases recruits the ubiquitin ligases SMURF1 or NEDD4L to target SMADs for ubiquitin-mediated degradation (Aragon *et al.*, 2011).

While TAZ and YAP are linked to both TGFβ- and BMP-mediated SMAD signaling, some differences between TAZ and YAP function have been suggested. TAZ was found to only weakly interact with BMP-activated SMAD1, suggesting that TAZ may have a more minor role in regulating BMP signaling relative to YAP. Consistent with this, TAZ depletion in mouse ES cells, which maintain pluripotency *in vitro* via BMP signaling, does not alter their pluripotent state (Varelas *et al.*, 2008), whereas YAP knockdown does (Alarcon *et al.*, 2009; Lian *et al.*, 2010). YAP knockdown also prevents the reprogramming of mouse-induced pluripotent cells from fibroblasts (Lian *et al.*, 2010). However, some level of redundancy in regulating BMP signaling may exist between TAZ and YAP given the influence of TAZ in BMP-induced osteoblast differentiation (Hong *et al.*, 2005). BMP2 induces TAZ expression in osteoblasts, leading to the targeting of TAZ to the osteocalcin promoter via interaction with RUNX2 (Hong *et al.*, 2005).

A connection between Hippo and TGFβ signaling has also been made in *D. melanogaster*. Dpp is a fly BMP family member that activates the transcription factor Mad to drive key developmental processes, including growth control and patterning, in fly development (Affolter and Basler, 2007). Dpp-mediated growth promoting activity was found to act synergistically with Yki via interaction with Mad (Alarcon *et al.*, 2009; Oh and Irvine, 2011). Interaction with Yki was shown to enable distinct MAD-driven transcriptional programs, including the regulation of the micro-RNA *bantam* (Oh and Irvine, 2011).

### The Hippo pathway controls SMAD subcellular localization

In addition to the transcriptional relationship between TAZ/YAP and SMADs, an unexpected, and more profound, role for TAZ/YAP have also been uncovered in the regulation of TGFβ signaling. This role was discovered when it was found that TGFβ-induced SMAD 2/3/4 complexes fail to accumulate in the nucleus in the absence of TAZ (Varelas *et al.*, 2008). YAP was also shown to participate in directing

SMAD2/3 nuclear accumulation, revealing redundant roles for TAZ and YAP in this process (Varelas *et al.*, 2010b). The data suggests that TAZ/YAP function as retention factors for TGFβ-regulated SMAD complexes, and that TAZ/YAP determine SMAD localization. Support for this idea includes observations that TGFβ-induced SMAD nuclear accumulation is blocked upon shifting TAZ/YAP to the cytoplasm, either by overexpression or via Hippo pathway activation (Varelas *et al.*, 2008, 2010b).

Hippo pathway activity is coupled to cell density, in that TAZ/YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic localization is facilitated by cell-cell contacts (Figure 3) (Zhao *et al.*, 2007; Varelas *et al.*, 2010b). Consistent with a role in regulating SMAD localization, cytoplasmic TAZ/YAP in high-density cultures is associated with phosphorylated and active SMAD complexes, thereby trapping SMAD complexes in the cytoplasm and consequently suppressing TGFβ signaling (Figure 3a) (Varelas *et al.*, 2010b). TAZ/YAP localization precisely mirrors TGFβ-induced SMAD2/3 localization *in vitro*, as well as in the developing pre-gastrula mouse embryo *in vivo* (Varelas *et al.*, 2010b). Interfering with the Hippo pathway by means of LATS1/2 knockdown either *in vitro* or *in vivo* permits TAZ/YAP nuclear accumulation, which is accompanied by SMAD 2/3 nuclear accumulation and TGFβ target gene expression (Varelas *et al.*, 2010b). Moreover, disruption of cell contacts by Ca²⁺ depletion leads to nuclear accumulation of hypophosphorylated TAZ/YAP (as a result of diminished LATS1/2-dependent phosphorylation), and restores TGFβ-dependent SMAD nuclear accumulation and target gene induction (Figure 3b).

Taken together, these studies indicate a key role for TAZ/YAP in directing the localization and function of the TGFβ family-regulated SMADs. These studies have also revealed a hierarchical level of SMAD control that is mediated by the Hippo pathway. Such control would allow for cellular cues that influence the Hippo pathway, such as cell density, to impact on TGFβ signaling. Given the crucial roles for TGFβ/SMAD signaling in early development (Arnold and Robertson, 2009), it is likely that TAZ/YAP localization specifies TGFβ-regulated events required for proper embryo patterning. Furthermore, the link between Hippo and TGFβ signaling may stimulate the oncogenic roles of TAZ and YAP, including their ability to promote the acquisition of metastatic cellular properties. TGFβ/SMAD signaling is known as a potent mediator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (Thiery *et al.*, 2009), and thus an increase in nuclear TAZ/YAP would sensitize cells to TGFβ and facilitate this process. However, more studies are required to fully comprehend these relationships.

### Polarity regulators and Hippo signaling

Genetic studies in *D. melanogaster* initially identified the Crumbs polarity protein as an upstream regulator of the Hippo pathway (Grzeschik *et al.*, 2010; Ling *et al.*, 2010; Robinson *et al.*, 2010). Affinity purification-mass spectrometry of TAZ and YAP complexes in densely

Hypophosphorylated TAZ and YAP proteins accumulate in the nucleus to serve as transcriptional regulators. In this scenario, both the TGFβ and WNT pathway are active via TAZ/YAP-mediated stimulation of SMAD and/or TCF/LEF transcription factors. (b) At high cell density, the assembly of polarity-regulated protein complexes, including the Crumbs polarity complex and the adherens junction-associated protein α-catenin, relays information to promote Hippo pathway-mediated TAZ and YAP phosphorylation. This leads to the binding of TAZ and YAP to 14-3-3 proteins and cytoplasmic retention. Cytoplasmic TAZ and YAP can associate with TGFβ-activated SMAD complexes to prevent their nuclear accumulation, and suppress DVL phosphorylation to inhibit Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Cultured epithelial cells further identified interactions with components of the Crumbs polarity complex, indicating a conserved role for this complex in regulating Hippo pathway activity. TAZ/YAP-binding partners include PALS1, MPDZ/MUPP1, LIN7C and Angiomotin/AMOT (Varelas et al., 2010b; Zhao et al., 2011) (Figure 3a). Interestingly, AMOT and several Crumbs complex components were recently found to also bind Merlin (Yi et al., 2011), suggesting that the role of Merlin in Hippo pathway regulation may be tied to the Crumbs complex.

The Crumbs polarity complex is a well-studied tight junction-associated protein complex that localizes to the apical domain of polarized epithelial cells (Bulgakova and Knust, 2009). Knockdown of CRB3, PALS1 or AMOT enhances nuclear TAZ/YAP activity (Varelas et al., 2010b; Zhao et al., 2011; Chan et al., 2011a). The Crumbs polarity complex relays cell density information by influencing TAZ/YAP phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention, which impacts on SMAD localization and consequently TGFβ signaling (Varelas et al., 2010b). Mechanistically, the details connecting the Crumbs complex to Hippo pathway activation remain unclear, however, it appears that LATS1/2 recruitment and activation is modulated at some level by this polarity complex. Recent studies have suggested a role for Kibra in mediating LATS1/2 activity (Baumgartner et al., 2010; Genevet et al., 2010; Yu et al., 2010; Xiao et al., 2011), and given that Kibra is known to interact with Crumbs complex components it may serve as an important scaffolding intermediate.

Another important polarity-associated regulator of Hippo signaling is α-catenin. YAP binds to α-catenin (Figure 3b), which regulates YAP phosphorylation and localization by preventing YAP dephosphorylation by PP2A (Schlegelmilch et al., 2011). Knockdown of α-catenin results in more nuclear TAZ and YAP, elevating TAZ/YAP transcriptional activity and a concomitant increase in TGFβ-mediated nuclear SMAD accumulation (Varelas et al., 2010b). Loss of α-catenin in the epidermis results in enhanced nuclear YAP activity, which drives skin squamous cell carcinomas (Schlegelmilch et al., 2011; Silvis et al., 2011). Interaction with α-catenin requires 14-3-3 binding as well as intact YAP

WW domains (Schlegelmilch *et al.*, 2011). As α-catenin lacks the PPXY motif required for interaction with WW domains, other proteins must bridge this interaction. Given that α-catenin recruitment to adherens junctions precedes Crumbs complex assembly, it would be of interest to investigate at what level these proteins share roles in TAZ/YAP regulation. Of note, along with the WW domain, the PDZ-binding motif in TAZ also appears to be important for binding to PALS1 (Varelas *et al.*, 2010b). Given that many of these polarity-associated proteins possess PDZ-binding motifs, these interactions are likely to have an important role in Hippo pathway regulation. For example, the PDZ-binding domain of TAZ/YAP also mediates interactions with PATJ (Duning *et al.*, 2010). Additionally, this motif regulates binding to the tight junction protein ZO-2 (Oka *et al.*, 2010; Remue *et al.*, 2010). ZO-2 possesses both a nuclear import and export signal, which regulates its localization depending on cell density (Islas *et al.*, 2002). At sub-confluent conditions ZO-2 is nuclear, and in this scenario ZO-2 mediates nuclear accumulation of TAZ/YAP. For YAP, this drives its pro-apoptotic nuclear function (Oka *et al.*, 2010; Remue *et al.*, 2010). In confluent epithelial cell cultures, ZO-2 is associated with tight junctions. Under these conditions, or under conditions driving cytoplasmic localization such as ZO-2 overexpression, ZO-2 binding to TAZ can inhibit TAZ nuclear accumulation (Remue *et al.*, 2010). Interestingly, AMOT binding to TAZ/YAP-ZO-2 complexes inhibits this nuclear function (Oka *et al.*, 2011). Therefore, ZO-2 has an important role in controlling TAZ/YAP localization. It will be of interest to dissect this relationship further, and understand its relationship with LATS1/2 kinases, given their important function in controlling TAZ/YAP localization. Of further interest is the ability of the TAZ/YAP WW domains to mediate nuclear interactions that drive transcriptional function (Zhao *et al.*, 2009; Zhang *et al.*, 2009c; Chan *et al.*, 2011b). This suggests that in addition to PDZ-domain proteins, such as ZO-2, the WW-domains of TAZ/YAP likely mediate binding to other regulators of TAZ/YAP localization. Therefore, it appears that a key mode of TAZ/YAP regulation is the existing competition between nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins that fine-tune the strength of TAZ/YAP activity.

Hippo and Wnt

Recent studies have indicated that the Hippo pathway also has key roles in regulating Wnt signaling. Wnts are secreted factors that bind to Frizzled and LRP cell surface receptors to stimulate a wide range of biological responses. The best-characterized signals that are activated by Wnt ligands are those propagated by the transcriptional regulator β-catenin (reviewed in Nusse (2005); Clevers (2006); MacDonald *et al.* (2009)). In the absence of Wnt, nuclear and cytoplasmic levels of β-catenin are kept low as a result of the activity of a complex of proteins known as the destruction complex. The destruction complex is composed of GSK3β kinase, and the scaffolding proteins APC and Axin. This complex mediates the phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3β and recruits the SCF/βTrCP complex, which targets β-catenin for ubiquitination and subsequent proteasomal degradation (reviewed in Kimelman and Xu (2006)). The binding of Wnt to Frizzled/LRP receptors results ultimately in the phosphorylation of Dishevelled (DVL) proteins by Casein Kinase 1 δ/ε kinases and the inhibition of the destruction complex, though the manner by which the latter occurs is relatively unclear. This results in the stabilization and subsequent nuclear localization of β-catenin, where it associates with TCF/LEF transcription factors to drive transcription (Figure 1).

The first indication that the Wnt pathway is connected to Hippo signaling came from genetic screens in *D. melanogaster* that showed that *hpo*, *wts*, *fat* and *expanded* mutants display enhanced wingless (*Wg*, which is fly Wnt) target gene expression (Tyler and Baker, 2007). A more direct connection was suggested from high-throughput screening analysis of the Wnt pathway, which uncovered TAZ as a potential regulator of Wnt signaling (Miller *et al.*, 2009). TAZ indeed was found to regulate Wnt signals, functioning to inhibit signaling via direct interaction with DVL proteins (Varelas *et al.*, 2010a). The interaction between TAZ and DVL is mediated by two interfaces: the WW domain within TAZ binds to a PY motif in DVL, and the PDZ domain within DVL binds to the C-terminal PDZ-binding motif in TAZ. TAZ competes with CK1δ/ε kinases for binding to the PDZ domain of DVL (Varelas *et al.*, 2010a), resulting in decreased levels of phosphorylated DVL. Accordingly, knockdown of TAZ leads to increased levels of phosphorylated DVL and consequentially elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling. The impact of reduced TAZ levels on Wnt signaling can be visualized in TAZ knockout mice, which develop severe cysts in their kidneys during development. β-catenin in these polycystic kidneys has a much more pronounced nuclear distribution (Varelas *et al.*, 2010a). Increased Wnt/β-catenin signaling has been linked to polycystic kidney formation (Saadi-Kheddouci *et al.*, 2001; Sansom *et al.*, 2005) and it is therefore likely that elevated Wnt/β-catenin signaling contributes to the occurrence of cysts in TAZ knockout kidneys.

Hippo pathway activity is required for TAZ to inhibit DVL phosphorylation, indicating that localization of TAZ has a critical role in how it functions in the Wnt pathway. Knockdown of LATS1 or upstream MST2 leads to increases in nuclear TAZ, and decreases in DVL-bound TAZ (Varelas *et al.*, 2010a). Consequently, DVL phosphorylation is increased in response to Wnt in the absence of LATS1, as is downstream β-catenin signaling. Therefore, cytoplasmic TAZ has an inhibitory role in Wnt signaling. This is consistent with observations in *D. melanogaster* third instar wing imaginal discs, wherein *wts*-deficient clones display elevated Armadillo levels and increased expression of the Wg target *distal-less* (Varelas *et al.*, 2010a).

Other potential cytoplasmic relationships between TAZ and Wnt signaling also exist. For example, TAZ has a role in influencing protein degradation by acting as
a scaffold for the SCF/β-TrCP ubiquitin ligase complex,  
a complex that promotes the ubiquitination of β-catenin  
(Tian *et al.*, 2007) (Figure 1). While the inhibitory role of  
TAZ in regulating DVL is distinct from its role with the  
SCF/β-TrCP ligase (Varelas *et al.*, 2010a), it is possible  
SCF/β-TrCP-bound TAZ may impact on Wnt signaling  
in other yet undetermined ways. Interestingly, another  
possible convergence between TAZ and Wnt signaling  
are cilia. Cilia formation has been implicated in the  
downregulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling by mediat-  
ing DVL phosphorylation (Corbit *et al.*, 2008). A sub-  
population of TAZ localizes to cilia, and disruption of  
TAZ results in ciliogenesis defects (Hossain *et al.*, 2007).  
In this role, TAZ is implicated in the regulation of the  
cilia-localized mechano-sensory protein Polycystin-2 via  
a negative feedback loop involving the NimA-related  
protein kinase Nek1 (Tian *et al.*, 2007; Yim *et al.*, 2011).  
Additionally, NPHP4, a cilia-associated protein often  
mutated in the degenerative kidney disease nephronoph-  
tisis, negatively regulates the Hippo pathway (Habbig  
*et al.*, 2011). Therefore, it will be of interest to further  
examine the connection between cilia, mechano-sensing,  
Wnt signaling and the Hippo pathway in more detail.  
A more recent study has shown another level of  
association between Hippo signaling and Wnt signaling,  
which has a critical role in heart development (Heallen  
*et al.*, 2011). This study characterized the effects of  
loss of Sav in cardiac muscle using *Nkx2.5<sup>cre</sup>*, and found  
that ablation of Sav function results in enlarged hearts  
that maintain proper patterning. The group also  
examined cardiac-specific *Mstl/2* double-knockout  
mice and *Lats2* knockout mice, and found similar  
effects, indicating a key role for proper Hippo pathway  
regulation in heart development. These mutants display  
decreased YAP phosphorylation and increased cardio-  
myocyte proliferation. When gene profiles were exam-  
ined from these mutant embryos, an elevated Wnt  
signature was observed. β-catenin nuclear localization  
was also increased in the Sav mutants, suggesting that  
Wnt signaling in these mutants is increased. Stronger  
support indicating that the upregulation of Wnt/β-  
catenin signaling contributes to Sav mutant defects  
comes from the observations that conditional removal  
of one allele of β-catenin suppresses many of the  
developmental defects. Together these results provide  
genetic evidence in a mammalian model system that the  
Hippo pathway functions to restrict Wnt/β-catenin  
signaling. Although this study did not focus on the  
cytoplasmic roles of TAZ/YAP, it did reveal that YAP  
is recruited to TCF/LEF-binding sites together with β-  
catenin to mediate transcriptional responses. Therefore,  
crosstalk between the Hippo and Wnt pathways exists  
both in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm (Figure 1).  
Taken together, these data indicate that TAZ/YAP  
function both as inhibitors and activators of Wnt/β-  
catenin signaling depending on Hippo pathway activity.  
When the Hippo pathway is active, Wnt signaling is  
inhibited by cytoplasmic TAZ/YAP, whereas in the  
absence of Hippo pathway signaling, TAZ/YAP localize  
to the nucleus where they can augment Wnt/β-catenin  
signals (Figure 1). Like with TGFβ signaling, TAZ/YAP

**Hippo signaling in context**  
A Mauviel *et al*

likely have key roles in defining Wnt signals during  
development and disease progression. Furthermore,  
given that TGFβ/SMAD and Wnt/β-catenin signaling  
synergize to mediate a large number of events (Attisano  
and Labbe, 2004), it is possible that TAZ/YAP may  
facilitate this more complex level of crosstalk.

**Hippo crosstalk with other signaling pathways**  
In addition to crosstalk with TGFβ and Wnt, the Hippo  
pathway intersects other signaling cascades, including  
Hedgehog, Notch, Jak/Stat, Jnk, phosphatidylinositol  
3-kinase (PI3-kinase)/AKT and those regulating  
apoptosis (see below).  
One of the pathways first proposed to have connec-  
tions to the Hippo pathway was the cell survival  
pathway mediating PI3-kinase/AKT signaling. Early  
reports suggested that AKT directly phosphorylates  
YAP Serine 127 to facilitate 14-3-3 binding (Basu *et al.*,  
2003). Although this may be the case under certain  
circumstances, developmental studies have indicated  
that LATS1 and LATS2 kinases are the predominant  
regulators of this phosphorylation event and have  
shifted focus away from AKT. Regardless, there are  
clearly connections between Hippo signaling and the  
AKT pathway. Activation of the PI3-kinase/AKT  
pathway leads to interaction of AKT with MST1  
and MST2 kinases, resulting in their phosphorylation  
on Threonine 120 or Threonine 117, respectively  
(Kim *et al.*, 2010; Yuan *et al.*, 2010). AKT also has  
been shown to phosphorylate MST1 on Threonine 387  
(Jang *et al.*, 2007). Phosphorylation of these highly  
conserved residues inhibits MST kinase activity, indicat-  
ing that PI3-kinase/AKT signals have the propensity to  
restrict Hippo-related kinases.  
Another inhibitor of the MST2 kinase is the RAF1  
proto-oncogene, which binds to MST2 and prevents its  
activation. RASSF1A, a gene often downregulated in  
tumorigenic cells, prevents MST2 binding by RAF1,  
thereby promoting MST2 activation and MST2 pro-  
apoptotic functions (Matallanas *et al.*, 2007). Intrigu-  
ingly, under these conditions MST-mediated activation  
of LATS kinases leads to both an increase in Serine 127  
YAP phosphorylation and an accumulation of nuclear  
YAP. YAP subsequently binds p73 and promotes its  
ability to drive apoptosis. This is in contradiction to the  
characterized function of the Hippo pathway in growth  
control, mapped with genetic studies, suggesting that  
additional levels of control exist to regulate nuclear  
accumulation of YAP under certain pro-apoptotic  
conditions.  
Recent studies have highlighted another connection  
between apoptosis and Hippo signaling. LATS1 and  
LATS2 have been shown to interact with apoptosis-  
stimulating protein of p53-1, ASPP1 (Aylon *et al.*, 2010;  
Vigneron *et al.*, 2010). In the cytoplasm, ASPP1  
inhibits apoptosis by preventing interaction of LATS1  
with TAZ/YAP (Vigneron *et al.*, 2010). This leads  
to increased nuclear TAZ/YAP and consequently  
the inhibition of apoptosis. Upon oncogenic insult,  
however, ASPP1 translocates to the nucleus in response  to LATS2 phosphorylation. Together with LATS, nuclear ASPP1 promotes p53-mediated apoptosis (Aylon *et al.*, 2010). Interestingly, YAP can inhibit binding between LATS2 and ASPP1 and inhibit ASPP1-driven apoptosis (Aylon *et al.*, 2010). Thus, there appears to be a context-dependent role for LATS-ASPP1 interaction that impacts on apoptotic signaling. Another member of the apoptosis-stimulating proteins of p53-1, ASPP2, has also been shown to bind TAZ and YAP (Espanel and Sudol, 2001; Liu *et al.*, 2011). Binding of ASPP2 to TAZ facilitates the recruitment of the PP1A phosphatase, which dephosphorylates TAZ at Serine 89 and Serine 311. This subsequently stabilizes TAZ levels and increases TAZ function in the nucleus (Liu *et al.*, 2011).

Hedgehog pathway activity has been linked to YAP oncogenic potential in human medulloblastomas (Fernandez *et al.*, 2009). Activation of sonic hedgehog is associated with medulloblastomas, which usually affect children. Sonic hedgehog is thought to sustain the proliferation of cerebellar granule neuron precursors, those cells primarily contributing to the disease. YAP mRNA and protein is upregulated in medulloblastomas and the corresponding elevation of nuclear YAP, in concert with TEAD transcription factors, drives cerebellar granule neuron precursor proliferation. Thus, Hedgehog-mediated signals rely on nuclear YAP activity in at least this scenario, and these observations suggest Hippo pathway activity may in fact bolster Hedgehog signaling.

Genetic analyses in *D. melanogaster* have also linked the Notch and Hippo pathways. The Hippo pathway has been shown to control the expression and subcellular localization of Notch, thereby controlling Notch-dependent transcriptional events (Meignin *et al.*, 2007; Polesello and Tapon, 2007). This regulation is important for the differentiation of follicle cells during oogenesis, and is required to induce axis specification and proper polarity in the fly oocyte. Expression of a constitutively active form of Notch alleviates the oocyte polarity defects that result from Hippo pathway mutations, indicating that the Hippo pathway converges directly with Notch signaling (Yu *et al.*, 2008). This point of convergence is likely linked with the ability of the Hippo pathway to regulate the expression of the Notch ligands, Serrate and Delta (Cho *et al.*, 2006; Reddy *et al.*, 2010). However, further studies are required to clarify this.

Another pathway that is regulated by Hippo signaling is the JAK/STAT pathway. This was uncovered from studies of the *D. melanogaster* midgut, which showed that increasing nuclear Yki activity, either by mutations in upstream Hippo pathway components or by expression of an activated allele of Yki, leads to increased expression of the JAK/STAT cytokine Unpaired (Upd) and increase in JAK/STAT signaling (Karpowicz *et al.*, 2010; Ren *et al.*, 2010; Shaw *et al.*, 2010; Staley and Irvine, 2010). These studies revealed that JAK/STAT regulation by the Hippo pathway is essential for the activation of stem cell proliferation during regeneration, as changes in Hippo pathway

activity and subsequently JAK/STAT signaling occur in response to midgut injury. Interestingly, one of these studies showed that Hippo pathway mutants in the fly midgut also show increases in EGFR ligand expression, indicating additional crosstalk with this pathway (Ren *et al.*, 2010). This level of regulation is likely conserved in mammals, as similar results were obtained from a study looking at the effects of YAP expression in cultured breast epithelial cells. This study identified the EGFR ligand Amphiregulin as an important target of YAP that has a non-autonomous role in cell proliferation (Zhang *et al.*, 2009b).

Finally, the Hippo pathway is known to regulate the expression of the fly heparin sulfate proteoglycans, *dally* and *dally-like* (Baena-Lopez *et al.*, 2008). These polysaccharides influence the direction and breadth of ligand-dependent signaling, and as such likely contribute to a wide variety of developmental signaling pathways.

### Conclusion

By functioning as a mediator of multiple signals, the Hippo pathway provides the cell with a central controlling mechanism to allow external cell contact cues to coordinate both cell proliferation and vital growth factor responses. Why would the cell need such a mode of organizing information? The answer is best exemplified by the dominant role that the Hippo pathway has in the first cell fate decisions occurring in an embryo, where the positional information of a cell dictates cell fate (Nishioka *et al.*, 2009). Tissue architecture therefore functions at the top of a regulatory hierarchy to guide proliferation of cell populations, and control cellular responses to extracellular growth factors via Hippo pathway regulation. As a consequence this allows for proper tissue and organ organization, and an internal controlling mechanism for accurate organ size. These functions for the Hippo pathway predict that the pathway will have crucial roles in almost all aspects of animal development, which indeed is emerging to be the case. It would also predict that deregulation of Hippo pathway activity would result in catastrophic events, which is also supported by the quickly growing number of studies.

Although the roles for the Hippo pathway continue to unravel and become more complex, there is still much to be understood. For example, the upstream signals mediating Hippo signaling and how these are connected to tissue organization is still poorly understood. Furthermore, the key processes mediated by the Hippo pathway in animal development and in oncogenesis are relatively unclear. Given the network of interactions with other critical regulators of these processes, future work will undoubtedly clarify these questions.
