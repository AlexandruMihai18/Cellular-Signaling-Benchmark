A great deal of effort has been devoted during the past 20 years to defining the chemical nature of prions, the infectious agents responsible for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. In contrast, much less attention has been paid to elucidating how prions actually damage the central nervous system. Although it is commonly assumed that PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, the protein constituent of infectious prions, is the primary culprit, increasing evidence indicates that this may not be the case. Several alternative molecular forms of PrP are reasonable candidates for the neurotoxic species in prion diseases, although it is still too early to tell whether these or other ones will turn out to be the true instigating factors. The cellular pathways activated by neurotoxic forms of PrP that ultimately result in neuronal death are also being investigated, and several possible mechanisms have been uncovered, including the operation of quality control processes in the endoplasmic reticulum. Elucidating the distinction between the infectious and neurotoxic forms of PrP has important implications for designing therapy of prion diseases, as well as for understanding pathogenic mechanisms operative in other neurodegenerative disorders and the role of prion-like states in biology.

**INTRODUCTION**

Prion diseases, also called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, are fatal neurodegenerative disorders that have attracted enormous scientific attention because they exemplify a novel mechanism of biological information transfer based on the transmission of protein conformation rather than on the inheritance of nucleic acid sequence. These diseases have also had profound impact on public health because of compelling evidence that bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), which reached epidemic proportions in Britain in the 1990s and is now increasing in other European countries as well, has been transmitted to about 100 human beings by consumption of contaminated beef. There is also great concern that these diseases could be acquired by blood transfusion or the administration of blood-derived products.

Many lines of evidence indicate that PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, a conformationally altered isoform of the cellular protein PrP<sup>C</sup>, plays a key role in the origin of prion diseases (for comprehensive reviews, see Prusiner, 1998; Collinge, 2001). Enciphered in the conformation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is all the information necessary for propagation of the infectious agent (prion) and for specification of the clinical and neuropathological characteristics that distinguish different forms of prion diseases. A major gap exists, however, in our understanding of how the conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> ultimately kills neurons and causes the other neuropathological features of these disorders. Many questions related to the pathogenic mechanisms underlying prion diseases remain unresolved. For example, is neuronal damage caused by a loss of the normal function of PrP<sup>C</sup> or by gain of a toxic property of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>? Is PrP<sup>Sc</sup> the primary trigger of the neurodegenerative process, or are there neurotoxic PrP species other than PrP<sup>Sc</sup>? What molec

ular and cellular pathways are activated in these diseases that lead ultimately to neuronal loss?

The purpose of this review is to critically examine the available experimental evidence concerning the role of PrP<sup>sc</sup> in the pathogenesis of prion diseases, to discuss recent data indicating that prion protein isoforms distinct from PrP<sup>sc</sup> possess pathogenic properties, to introduce the possibility that pathogenicity and infectivity are distinguishable biological properties of PrP, and to review cellular pathways that may be responsible for prion-induced neurodegeneration. Elucidating the mechanisms underlying the pathogenic activity of abnormal PrP molecules represents a crucial step in our understanding of prion diseases and could reveal neurotoxic mechanisms that are also operative in nontransmissible neurodegenerative disorders of protein conformation such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and polyglutamine disorders.

## PRION DISEASES

Prion diseases are unusual neurodegenerative disorders that affect both humans and animals. Included in this group are kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), Gerstmann-Sträussler syndrome (GSS), and fatal familial insomnia (FFI) in humans, scrapie in sheep, and BSE in cattle. The primary symptom of the human disorders is dementia, usually accompanied by manifestations of motor dysfunction such as cerebellar ataxia, myoclonus, and pyramidal or extrapyramidal signs. The symptoms generally appear in mid- to late adult life and last from months to years prior to death. Neuropathologically, these disorders are characterized by neuronal loss and astrogliosis, and sometimes by spongiform degeneration of the brain and deposition of amyloid plaques. Overall, human prion diseases have a worldwide incidence of approximately 1 case/million people/year.

Three different manifestations of prion diseases are recognized: infectious, familial, and sporadic. The infectious origin is dramatically illustrated by kuru, a strange neurodegenerative illness of the Fore tribe of New Guinea that was found to be transmitted among women and children by ritual cannibalism (Gajdusek & Zigas, 1957). Other examples include iatrogenic cases of CJD due to dura mater grafts and cadaverically derived growth hormone (Brown et al., 1992), as well as BSE and its human counterpart, “new variant” CJD (Weissmann and Aguzzi, 1997; Collinge, 1999). Familial prion diseases, which include about 10% of the cases of CJD and all cases of GSS and FFI, are inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion and are linked to germline mutations in the PrP gene on chromosome 20 (Young et al., 1999). Point mutations occur in the C-terminal half of the PrP molecule and are associated with either CJD, GSS, or FFI. Insertional mutations, which are associated with a CJD or mixed CJD-GSS phenotype, occur in the N-terminal half of the protein, and consist of one to nine additional copies of an octapeptide repeat that is normally present in five copies. Sporadic prion diseases, which include most cases of CJD, have no obvious infectious or genetic etiology. Sporadic and at least some cases of familial prion disorders, are transmissible to laboratory animals, emphasizing that, regardless of how they are acquired, all of these illnesses are characterized by the generation of an infectious agent.

## THE PRION HYPOTHESIS: PrP<sup>sc</sup> IS THE INFECTIOUS AGENT

The chemical nature of the infectious agent in spongiform encephalopathies has been the subject of intense scrutiny and considerable debate for nearly 40 years. The observation that the scrapie agent was resistant to procedures that inactivate or modify nucleic acids, and was sensitive to treatments that denature or hydrolyze proteins, led to speculation that the agent could be a self-replicating protein devoid of nucleic acids (Alper et al., 1967; Griffith, 1967). Building upon these early speculations, Stanley Prusiner in 1982 hypothesized the existence of a novel class of infectious agents that he named prions (for proteinaceous infectious particles) (Prusiner, 1982). Attempts to purify the infectious agent from scrapie-infected hamster brains using differential centrifugation and proteinase K (PK) digestion led to the isolation of rod-shaped particles that co-purified with infectivity measured in an incubation time bioassay. Biochemical characterization of these prion rods revealed that they contained little if any nucleic acid, and were composed largely of PrP 27–30, a protease-resistant fragment of a 33- to 35-kDa precursor called PrP<sup>sc</sup> (Prusiner et al., 1984). Since PrP<sup>sc</sup> is found in the brains of individuals affected by most infectious, sporadic, and familial prion diseases, and is not found in the brains of healthy individuals, it is often viewed as the biochemical hallmark of all these illnesses.

It was subsequently determined that PrP<sup>sc</sup> is actually an isoform of PrP<sup>c</sup>, a protein of unknown function that is encoded by a cellular gene (Oesch et al., 1985; Basler et al., 1986). PrP<sup>sc</sup> and PrP<sup>c</sup> differ in their biochemical properties, with PrP<sup>sc</sup> being protease-resis-

FIG. 1. PrP and the prion hypothesis. (A) Structures and properties of PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. The PrP<sup>C</sup> structure shown here, which represents the C-terminal, folded domain (residues 90–231 of Syrian hamster PrP), has been determined experimentally using NMR techniques, and consists of three α-helices (labeled A, B, and C), with two short β-strands flanking helix A. The N-terminal segment of PrP<sup>C</sup> (residues 23–89, not shown) has a flexibly disordered structure. The PrP<sup>Sc</sup> structure is a plausible model in which helix A has been lost, and the N-terminal region (residues 108–144) contains two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands. (Both structures are taken with permission from Prusiner (2001).) (B) Models for the three manifestations of prion diseases. In the infectious origin, exogenous PrP<sup>Sc</sup> imprints its conformation on endogenous PrP<sup>C</sup> by a physical interaction. The new PrP<sup>Sc</sup> molecules generated can then convert more PrP<sup>C</sup> in an auto-catalytic fashion. In familial prion diseases, PrP<sup>C</sup> spontaneously converts to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> as a result of a mutation. In the sporadic manifestation, PrP<sup>C</sup> without a mutation spontaneously converts to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> at a low rate. Note that although PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is formed spontaneously in familial and sporadic prion diseases, once present, it can transmit its conformation to additional PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules via the infectious mechanism.

ifcations have been found (Stahl et al., 1993). Rather, they are thought to differ in their three-dimensional conformation, with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> having a much higher content of β-sheet than PrP<sup>C</sup> (Caughey et al., 1991; Pan et al., 1993). The complete structures of PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules from several species have been determined by NMR techniques (Riek et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1999), but there is not yet an experimentally defined structure for PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, although several kinds of models have been proposed (Fig. 1A). The conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is now thought to be the fundamental molecular event underlying all prion diseases, which are therefore sometimes referred to as disorders of protein conformation.

According to the current hypothesis, prions are composed of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which propagates itself by impressing its abnormal conformation on PrP<sup>C</sup>, thereby generating additional molecules of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in an autocatalytic reaction (Cohen & Prusiner, 1998) (Fig. 1B). This conversion reaction is thought to occur either by a template-assisted refolding mechanism in which binding of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to PrP<sup>C</sup> lowers the activation energy that separates the two states (Cohen, 1999), or via a nucleated polymerization process in which PrP<sup>Sc</sup> serves as a seed that recruits and stabilizes abnormal conformations of PrP that are in dynamic equilibrium with PrP<sup>C</sup> (Caughey, 2001). Familial prion diseases are presumed to arise because germline mutations in the PrP gene favor conformational conversion of mutant PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules into PrP<sup>Sc</sup> without the necessity for contact with exogenous prions (Fig. 1B). Sporadic cases are thought to be due to spontaneous conversion of wild-type PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules to the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> state at a low frequency (Fig. 1B), or alternatively, to rare somatic mutations in the PrP gene.

A great deal of evidence now supports the validity of the prion hypothesis (for critical reviews of this evidence, see Caughey & Chesebro, 1997; Chesebro, 1998). A strong prediction of this hypothesis is that expression of PrP by the host is necessary for the propagation of the infectious agent and for the development of the disease. In accordance with this prediction, it has been convincingly shown that *Prn-p<sup>0/0</sup>* mice in which the prion protein gene has been inactivated through homologous recombination are resistant to prion infection and do not sustain replication of the infectious agent (Büeler et al., 1993). There is also compelling evidence that the primary sequence of PrP encoded by the host is a major determinant of the species-specificity, incubation time, and neuropathological characteristics of prion transmission (Westaway et al., 1987; Scott et al., 1989; Prusiner et al., 1990). These and other lines of evidence (reviewed in

Prusiner, 1998) prove that PrP plays a key role in the disease process, and it has become increasingly difficult to explain all the existing data by a viral theory of pathogenesis. What some have considered to be a significant argument against the prion hypothesis, the existence of prion strains that produce different incubation times and neuropathological profiles in a single host, can now be explained by recent evidence that each strain may represent a distinct, self-propagating conformation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Telling et al., 1996b; Safar et al., 1998). It is important to recognize, however, that what is perhaps the most definitive test of the protein-only model has yet to be successfully carried out: producing infectivity *de novo* in a test tube by experimental manipulation of recombinant or synthetic PrP. The absence of this evidence does not invalidate the prion hypothesis, but simply underscores the difficulty of reconstituting this remarkable molecular transformation outside the cellular environment.

### EVIDENCE THAT PrP<sup>Sc</sup> IS PATHOGENIC

According to the prion hypothesis, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is the infectious form of PrP. (We will use this definition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the rest of the review.) However, is PrP<sup>Sc</sup> also the pathogenic form of PrP, the form that ultimately kills neurons, as illustrated in Fig. 2 (scheme 1)? This is a question that has until recently received little attention, largely because much of the effort in the prion field has been focused on understanding the nature of the infectious agent and resolving the controversy of whether PrP<sup>Sc</sup> itself can replicate in the absence of nucleic acid. In contrast, relatively little work has been done on elucidating the mechanism by which PrP<sup>Sc</sup> might damage neurons and cause the other neuropathological characteristics of the disease.

**Gain vs loss of PrP function.** The observation that two different lines of *Prn-p<sup>0/0</sup>* mice, which are devoid of PrP, do not show major anatomical, developmental, or behavioral abnormalities (Büeler et al., 1992; Manson et al., 1994a) argues strongly that the primary pathology in prion diseases is due to a toxic effect of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, or some other abnormal form of PrP, rather than to a loss of PrP<sup>C</sup> function. This statement is not meant to rule out the possibility that functional loss of PrP<sup>C</sup> by virtue of its conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> might contribute in an ancillary way to the disease process, but it is unlikely that this is the exclusive pathogenic mechanism. Although the normal, physiological role of PrP<sup>C</sup> remains enigmatic, there is evidence that the protein binds copper (Aronoff-Spencer et al., 2000; Cereghetti et al., 2001; Jackson et al., 2001; Kramer et al., 2001) and

cesses or alterations in metal metabolism (Guentchev *et al.*, 2000; Milhavet *et al.*, 2000; Wong *et al.*, 2000). In addition, several subtle phenotypic defects have been observed in *Prn-p*<sup>0/0</sup> mice, including alterations in synaptic transmission (Collinge *et al.*, 1994; Manson *et al.*, 1995), ionic currents (Colling *et al.*, 1996; Herms *et al.*, 2001), nerve fiber organization (Colling *et al.*, 1997), and circadian rhythm (Tobler *et al.*, 1996). Although the cellular and molecular basis of these phenotypes is obscure, it is conceivable that they could also contribute in some way to prion disease pathology. Finally, it has been reported that lines of transgenic mice expressing N-terminally deleted forms of PrP show ataxia and Purkinje cell degeneration (Shmerling *et al.*, 1998), as do lines of *Prn-p*<sup>0/0</sup> and transgenic mice in which there is elevated expression in the brain of doppel, a PrP paralog (Sakaguchi *et al.*, 1996; Moore *et al.*, 1999; Rossi *et al.*, 2001). These results have led to a proposed model in which PrP supplies a survival signal by binding to a putative ligand on adjacent neurons, and it is possible that failure of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> to supply this signal, and competition with remaining PrP<sup>C</sup> for ligand binding, also explain some features of prion-induced degeneration.

**PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and neuropathology.** The most compelling evidence that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is the primary toxic entity in prion diseases is the temporal and anatomical correlation that is often observed between accumulation of this isoform and the appearance of neuropathology and clinical symptoms (DeArmond *et al.*, 1987; Jendroska *et al.*, 1991; Williams *et al.*, 1997; Jeffrey *et al.*, 2001). PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, as detected by immunocytochemistry or Western blotting, usually appears prior to development of neuropathological changes such as spongiosis, neuronal loss, and astrogliosis. As the amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> increases during the course of the illness, the pathology becomes more severe, with brain regions containing large amounts of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> displaying more extensive changes than those containing minimal PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. The anatomical correlation can extend to the ultrastructural level, with PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulating in the extracellular space of the neuropil immediately adjacent to synaptic structures, which are often the first parts of the neuron to degenerate (Jeffrey *et al.*, 1994, 2001).

The topographic specificity of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation is particularly striking when different prion strains are analyzed. Scrapie strains are defined, in part, by the characteristic patterns of vacuolar pathology that they produce after inoculation into hosts with standardized genotypes (Bruce *et al.*, 1991). In VM/Dk mice, for example, the 87V strain produces a relatively restricted pattern of vacuolation that is confined to the medulla, thalamus, and hypothalamus, while the ME7

strain in the same host is associated with a more widespread vacuolation pattern that includes most brain regions with the exception of the cerebellum (Bruce *et al.*, 1989; Casaccia-Bonnefil *et al.*, 1993). In most cases, the distribution of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> closely mirrors the lesion profile displayed by each scrapie strain. Strains of sporadic and familial CJD in humans have also been identified, and for these, too, the regional pathology associated with each strain generally correlates with the distribution of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Parchi *et al.*, 1996; Mastrianni *et al.*, 1999; Puoti *et al.*, 1999). Since the biological properties of prion strains are thought to be “enciphered” in distinctive conformations of the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> molecule (Telling *et al.*, 1996b), strain specificity is most simply explained by the assumption that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> itself is the proximate trigger for neurodegeneration, with each PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conformer selectively targeting a particular subset of neurons (Hecker *et al.*, 1992).

**PrP peptides.** In principle, one could directly test the toxic effect of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> by applying the purified protein to neurons in culture. Although there have been several reports of such an experiment (Müller *et al.*, 1993; Giese *et al.*, 1998; Post *et al.*, 2000), they are difficult to interpret because of uncertainties about the physical state of the PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, since detergents that are required to maintain the protein in solution have to be removed prior to application to cell cultures.

An alternative strategy has been to analyze the effect on cultured neurons of synthetic peptides derived from the PrP sequence, which are easy to make and physically characterize. This approach is parallel to one that has been used extensively to characterize the toxicity of the Aβ fragment found in Alzheimer’s disease. Most studies have utilized a peptide spanning conserved residues 106–126, which partially overlaps a flexible region of the PrP<sup>C</sup> molecule that is thought to undergo conversion to β-sheet structures in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Riek *et al.*, 1997; Liu *et al.*, 1999). PrP106–126 has been found to form protease-resistant, β-sheet-rich, amyloid fibrils reminiscent of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and there is some evidence that a fibrillar state of the peptide is essential for its neurotoxicity (Selvaggini *et al.*, 1993; De Gioia *et al.*, 1994; Jobling *et al.*, 1999). When added to the medium, this peptide causes apoptotic death of cultured hippocampal, cortical, and cerebellar neurons, and induces proliferation and hypertrophy of cultured astroglia, thus reproducing *in vitro* two major neuropathological alterations seen in prion diseases (Forloni *et al.*, 1993; Brown *et al.*, 1994a; Forloni *et al.*, 1994; Brown *et al.*, 1996).

One might question the pathophysiological relevance of these experiments, since, unlike the situation for Aβ in Alzheimer’s disease, PrP106–126 is not ac-
tually a fragment found in the brains of humans or animals with prion diseases. However, a longer synthetic peptide, PrP82–146, that is identical in sequence to a fragment found in GSS plaques of human patients, also forms fibrils and is toxic to cultured neurons (Tagliavini *et al.*, 2000, and G. Forloni, pers. commun.). In addition, there is evidence that neurons cultured from *Prn-p*<sup>0/0</sup> mice are resistant to the toxic effects of PrP106–126 (Brown *et al.*, 1994a, 1996), arguing for a specific role of PrP<sup>C</sup> in mediating toxicity, a conclusion which has also emerged from neurografting experiments (see below).

Neurografts. A neurografting technique has been used to address the question of whether the presumed toxic effect of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is related to its generation within neurons, or to its accumulation in the extracellular space (Brandner *et al.*, 1996a, b). In these experiments, embryonic neurons from PrP<sup>C</sup>-expressing mice are transplanted into the brains of *Prn-p*<sup>0/0</sup> host mice. When the mice are inoculated intracerebrally with scrapie, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is generated only in the neural graft, since the host tissue does not express PrP<sup>C</sup> and is therefore resistant to infection. Strikingly, however, substantial amounts of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> spread from the graft site into the adjacent host tissue, but do not cause any pathological changes there. One interpretation of these results is that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposited extracellularly is not deleterious to neurons and that prion-induced neurodegeneration is instead the consequence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation within cells. Alternatively, extracellular PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is toxic, but only to those cells that express PrP<sup>C</sup>. In this case, the requirement for PrP<sup>C</sup> may result because PrP<sup>Sc</sup> initiates conversion of endogenous PrP<sup>C</sup> at the cell surface, because PrP<sup>Sc</sup> activates a degenerative cascade mediated by PrP<sup>C</sup>, or because PrP<sup>C</sup> is necessary for endocytic uptake of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> into the cell. In fact, multiple neurotoxic mechanisms could be active in prion diseases, and both intracellular accumulation and extracellular deposition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be part of the pathogenic cascade.

levels of PrP. As discussed previously, *Prn-p*<sup>0/0</sup> mice that lack PrP<sup>C</sup> cannot sustain prion infection (Büeler *et al.*, 1993). Conversely, mice that overexpress PrP are unusually susceptible to infection. Tga20 transgenic mice that express approximately 10 times more PrP than normal mice display a dramatically shortened incubation period when challenged with scrapie prions (60 days vs 150 days) (Fischer *et al.*, 1996). However, the rate of accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the brains of Tga20 mice does not correlate with the shortened incubation time and course of the illness. In terminally ill animals, the amount of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detectable by Western blotting is only about 50% of the amount found in infected, wild-type mice, and the prion titer is equivalent. A second example involves transmission of GSS prions to mice in which both copies of the endogenous PrP gene have been replaced with ones harboring the GSS-associated P101L mutation. In this case, the mice become sick and develop vacuolar degeneration, but only very low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are present by Western blotting and immunocytochemistry (Manson *et al.*, 1999). A related, but slightly different outcome is seen after scrapie inoculation of *Prn-p*<sup>0/0</sup> mice that have been reconstituted with a transgene encoding PrP lacking the N-terminal octapeptide repeats (∆32–93). These mice develop a fatal neurological illness, but there is virtually no observable neuropathology in the brain (although there is some in the spinal cord), and the amounts of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detected by Western blotting, as well prion titers, are 30–50 times lower than in similarly inoculated wild-type mice (Flechsig *et al.*, 2000). This experiment not only indicates a dissociation between PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and clinical illness, it also raises the possibility that neurological symptoms may be produced by subtle molecular or cellular changes that are not accompanied by detectable histopathology. A final example involves C57BL/6 mice inoculated with BSE prions, about 50% of which do not show detectable PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in their brains, although neurological symptoms and neuronal death are apparent (Lasmezas *et al.*, 1997). Only in subsequent passages does PrP<sup>Sc</sup> become detectable.

How might one interpret these transmission experiments? Two of the experiments involve host mice that express transgenes encoding modified forms of PrP, and it is possible that these mutant proteins can readily adopt a pathogenic conformation, but are relatively inefficient at forming infectious PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In Tga20 mice, it would appear that the extremely high levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> favor generation of neurotoxic over infectious forms of PrP, and a similar situation might arise even at normal expression levels when prion transmission

PATHOLOGY IN THE ABSENCE OF PrP<sup>Sc</sup>

Although accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is often temporally and spatially associated with the development of pathology, several situations have now been described where this correlation is weak, or where neurodegeneration occurs in the presence of low or undetectable levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.

Prion transmission to certain host mice. One example involves scrapie transmission to mice expressing high
occurs across a species barrier as in BSE-infected C57BL/6 mice.

**Familial prion diseases.** Several observations raise the possibility that inherited prion diseases as a group may involve pathogenic mechanisms that are distinct from those operative in prion diseases acquired by infection and that do not require a conventional PrP<sup>Sc</sup> intermediate. For example, it has been claimed that patients with GSS caused by an A117V mutation lack detectable PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and that an unusual transmembrane form of PrP distinct from PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is the primary pathogenic entity in these cases (Hegde *et al.*, 1998a) (see more below). This form is only mildly protease-resistant and is cleaved by PK near residue 108, more C-terminal than the site where authentic PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is cut. Other investigators have described what appears to be another kind of unconventional PrP in the brains of A117V patients (Piccardo *et al.*, 2001; Tagliavini *et al.*, 2001). This form, which is present in only small amounts, is cleaved by PK at both the N- and the C-termini (approximately at residues 90 and 150) to yield a 7-kDa fragment, considerably smaller than the PrP 27–30 piece derived from PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Truncated fragments of similar size are seen even without PK digestion, and are in fact a major component of the amyloid plaques seen in GSS patients carrying several different mutations (Tagliavini *et al.*, 1994). These results indicate that at least some mutations may cause disease by altering the conformation of the PrP molecule in a way that is distinct from that induced by interaction with infectious PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.

A second relevant observation is that familial prion diseases appear to be more difficult to transmit to laboratory animals than infectiously acquired or sporadic prion diseases (Brown *et al.*, 1994b). Some cases, for example those due to the A117V and V180I mutations, have never been successfully transmitted (Tateishi *et al.*, 1996). Of course, these failures may be due to a number of factors, including regional variations in infectivity levels within the brains used to prepare inocula, species barriers between the donor and the host, or the fact that only a small number of attempts have been made. However, it may also be the case that some mutant PrP molecules can be pathogenic without being infectious.

It is not difficult to rationalize the possibility that familial prion diseases may involve distinctive pathogenic mechanisms that are independent of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In these disorders, mutations must spontaneously alter the properties of the PrP molecule in a way that makes the protein toxic, but this change does not necessarily have to involve acquisition of a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> state. Interestingly, some mutations have been found to have no

affect on the thermodynamic stability of the PrP molecule (Riek *et al.*, 1998; Swietnicki *et al.*, 1998; Liemann and Glockshuber, 1999), suggesting that they may cause disease, not by major structural rearrangements of the protein, but by more subtle mechanisms such as altering interactions with other molecules that are involved in cell survival or apoptosis. Thus, it is likely that further analysis of familial prion diseases in humans and in transgenic mouse models will shed further light on PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-free forms of neurodegeneration.

Spontaneous neurodegeneration in transgenic mice. Analogous to familial prion diseases of humans, the spontaneous illnesses developed by several kinds of PrP transgenic mice have provided support for the possibility that neurodegeneration can occur in the absence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. One group of mice include those that express wild-type PrP at very high levels (Westaway *et al.*, 1994; Ghetti *et al.*, 2000), and those that express deleted or mutated forms of PrP not seen in human familial prion diseases (Muramoto *et al.*, 1997; Hegde *et al.*, 1998a; Shmerling *et al.*, 1998; Supattapone *et al.*, 2000, 2001). Although the neuropathological profiles seen in some of these lines are distinct from those of typical murine scrapie, neuronal loss, astrogliosis, and PrP deposition are often present. Significantly, protease-resistant PrP has been detected by Western blot in only two of these models (Supattapone *et al.*, 2000, 2001), and in none of the models has it been possible to transmit the illness to other mice. Thus, it seems likely that conventional PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is absent in some of these animals. Since these mice express PrP molecules whose sequences or expression levels are “artificial,” it might be argued that their illnesses have nothing to do with natural prion diseases. Nevertheless, the data further reinforce the conclusion that PrP can induce neurodegeneration without being converted to conventional PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.

There are currently two kinds of transgenic mice that express PrP molecules associated with inherited prion diseases of humans, and they provide additional evidence for the lack of association between PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and neurodegeneration. Tg(P101L) mice that express a GSS-related mutation show typical clinical and neuropathological features of murine scrapie, and in addition, their illness can be transmitted to low-expressing lines of Tg(P101L) mice that do not spontaneously become sick (Hsiao *et al.*, 1990, 1994; Telling *et al.*, 1996a). Surprisingly, the brains of Tg(P101L) mice do not contain PrP<sup>Sc</sup> that is detectable by Western blotting of PK-treated samples, even when low concentrations of protease are used. Tg(PG14) mice, which synthesize a 14-octapeptide repeat form of PrP associated with a mixed CJD–GSS phenotype in humans, also display
neurological and neuropathological abnormalities, but in this case the mice produce a weakly protease-resistant form of PrP that may be similar but not identical to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Chiesa *et al.*, 1998, 2000, 2001). As will be discussed below, biochemical analysis of the PrP molecules synthesized in some of these transgenic models has provided key insights into the distinction between pathogenic and infectious forms of PrP.

### PrP<sup>Sc</sup> IN THE ABSENCE OF NEUROPATHOLOGY OR CLINICAL SYMPTOMS

It has been observed that, despite the generally good correlation between PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and neuropathology, it is often possible to find individual areas in a diseased brain where PrP<sup>Sc</sup> immunostaining is strong, but neuropathological changes are minimal or absent (Hayward *et al.*, 1994; Parchi *et al.*, 1995). This phenomenon raises the possibility that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is not intrinsically neurotoxic, although it could also be explained by regional differences in the vulnerability of neurons to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>-mediated damage, or to a lag between exposure to the toxic insult and neuronal degeneration.

Perhaps more persuasive, however, there are now several examples of experimental transmission of prion diseases where PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulates to high levels without apparent clinical consequences. *Prn-p*<sup>0/+</sup> mice represent one such situation (Büeler *et al.*, 1994; Manson *et al.*, 1994b). These mice possess only one functional *Prn-p* allele and produce approximately half the normal level of PrP<sup>C</sup> in their brains. When challenged with scrapie prions, *Prn-p*<sup>0/+</sup> mice show enhanced resistance to development of disease, with a significantly prolonged incubation time and clinical course. In contrast, neuropathological changes (spongiosis and astrogliosis) develop in these animals almost as rapidly as in normal mice, and they accumulate high titers of infectivity and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> long before neurological symptoms ensue. In a second example, it has been found that a subset of B lymphocyte-deficient mice inoculated intraperitoneally with scrapie remains clinically and neuropathologically normal despite the presence of high levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and infectivity in their brains (Frigg *et al.*, 1999). Finally, accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the absence of symptoms has also been observed when prions are experimentally transmitted between different species. Mice are generally thought to be resistant to hamster scrapie, an observation that is cited as a classic example of the species barrier to prion transmission. However, it has recently been reported that CD1 mice inoculated with hamster prions

propagate infectivity, produce detectable levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and develop spongiform degeneration and amyloid plaques in their brains, even though they remain free of clinical disease during their lifetimes (Race & Chesebro, 1998; Hill *et al.*, 2000).

These examples of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulation in the absence of neurological symptoms, could be characterized as subclinical states of prion disease. Significantly, each of these cases involves prion transmission under “suboptimal” circumstances, because of either a nonphysiological level of PrP<sup>C</sup>, the absence of critical lymphoreticular cells, or the presence of a significant species barrier. In these situations, where animals are observed over extended periods of time, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may reach high levels as a result of rapid prion replication, but neurotoxic forms of PrP that are distinct from PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may accumulate more slowly and attain lower levels that induce some neuropathology, but are insufficient to cause clinical symptoms.

### ALTERNATIVE PATHOGENIC FORMS OF PrP

The evidence that neuropathy can develop in the apparent absence of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can accumulate without causing clinical symptoms, argues that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> itself might not be highly neurotoxic and that molecules other than PrP<sup>Sc</sup> could be responsible for prion-induced neurodegeneration. In principle, such alternative neurotoxic species (which we designate PrP<sup>toxic</sup>) could be intermediates in the prion replication process that lie along the molecular pathway from PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and that may or may not be infectious (Fig. 2, scheme 2). The existence of a PrP<sup>C</sup>–PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion intermediate designated PrP* has been hypothesized based on theoretical considerations (Cohen *et al.*, 1994), but it has not yet been identified experimentally, although several kinds of α-helix/β-sheet transition states of purified PrP have been observed *in vitro* (Jansen *et al.*, 2001; Morillas *et al.*, 2001). In an alternative scenario, PrP<sup>toxic</sup> may be generated as a by-product of prion replication that is not subsequently converted to infectious PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (Fig. 2, scheme 3). Although there is still insufficient information available to decide between these and other models, several alternative molecular forms of PrP have been described recently that might represent reasonable candidates for the neurotoxic species in prion diseases.

FIG. 3. Models of the three topological forms of PrP. ${}^{\mathrm{Sec}}$PrP, which is attached to the membrane exclusively by a GPI anchor, is the form adopted by the majority of PrP molecules under normal circumstances. ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP and ${}^{\mathrm{Ntm}}$PrP are unusual transmembrane forms. ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP contains a C-terminal GPI anchor as well as an uncleaved, N-terminal signal sequence.

molecules are attached to the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane through a C-terminal glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor (Stahl *et al.*, 1990; Lehmann & Harris, 1995). However, when PrP is synthesized in vitro, in transfected cells, or in mouse brain, some of the molecules assume a transmembrane orientation (Lopez *et al.*, 1990; Yost *et al.*, 1990; De Fea *et al.*, 1994; Hegde *et al.*, 1998a; Hölscher *et al.*, 2001; Kim *et al.*, 2001; Stewart *et al.*, 2001; Stewart & Harris, 2001). These species, designated ${}^{\mathrm{Ntm}}$PrP and ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP, span the lipid bilayer once via a highly conserved hydrophobic region in the center of the molecule (amino acids 111–134), with either the N-terminus or the C-terminus, respectively, on the extracytoplasmic side of the membrane (Fig. 3). It has been shown that these forms are generated in small amounts (<10% of the total PrP) as part of the normal biosynthesis of wild-type PrP in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Hegde *et al.*, 1998b). However, mutations within or near the transmembrane domain, including the A117V mutation linked to GSS as well as several “artificial” mutations not seen in human patients, increase the relative proportion of ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP to as much as 20–30% of the total (Hegde *et al.*, 1998a, 1999; Stewart *et al.*, 2001; Stewart & Harris, 2001).

Several pieces of evidence have been used to argue that ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP plays an important pathogenic role in prion diseases. First, transgenic mice have been generated that synthesize PrP molecules carrying the A117V mutation, or one of the other ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP-favoring mutations (Hegde *et al.*, 1998a, 1999). Animals expressing the mutant proteins above a threshold level synthesize ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP in their brains, and spontaneously develop a scrapie-like neurological illness, but without PrP${}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ detectable by Western blotting or infectivity assays. In addition, brain material from a patient with the A117V mutation, which has been reported to lack conventional PrP${}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ (see above), was found to contain detectable ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP using a biochemical assay (Hegde *et al.*, 1998a). These observations suggest that ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP might represent an alternative pathogenic form of PrP in those genetically determined cases of prion diseases in which PrP${}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ is not present.

Two additional results appear to tie ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP to prion diseases that arise by an infectious route as well. First, mice have been constructed in which a wild-type hamster PrP transgene serves as a reporter of ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP formation (Hegde *et al.*, 1999). When these animals are inoculated with mouse prions, the amounts of ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}}$PrP as well as PrP${}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ in the brain are found to increase during the course of the infection. This result has been interpreted to indicate that PrP${}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ induces formation of
$\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$, which is then the proximate cause of neurodegeneration. Second, when transgenic mice expressing $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$-favoring mutations are inoculated with prions, the amount of $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ that accumulates is inversely proportional to the level of $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ produced by each mutation (Hegde et al., 1999). The suggested interpretation of this experiment is that when a mutation induces high levels of $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$, only a small amount of $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ needs to accumulate in order to push the $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ level above the threshold for disease. Thus, the amount of $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ can be increased either directly by mutations in the PrP molecule, or indirectly via formation of $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ (Fig. 2, scheme 4). In this view, $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ is therefore a key intermediate in both genetic and infectious prion diseases.

Although this hypothesis is intriguing, there are several observations which argue against it, at least in its simplest form. First, we have found that most disease-causing mutations, with the exception of A117V, have no effect on the level of $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ (Stewart & Harris, 2001). This result is consistent with the observation that the central, hydrophobic region and the N-terminal signal sequence are the major determinants of PrP topology during ER translocation, and that other regions of the protein, where most pathogenic mutations lie, are topologically inert (Stewart et al., 2001). Thus, it is unlikely that $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ is an obligate intermediate in all familial forms of prion disease. Second, the maximal increase in $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ seen during the course of scrapie infection is only threefold (Hegde et al., 1999), much smaller than the increase in $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$, arguing against a causal role of $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ in $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ formation. It remains to be determined precisely what role $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ plays in prion-induced neurodegeneration. It is possible that $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ is involved in a subgroup of genetic prion diseases due to mutations within or near the central hydrophobic segment. Alternatively, $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ might cooperate with $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ in a pathogenic cascade. Finally, it remains possible that $\mathrm{C}^{\mathrm{tm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ is a byproduct of PrP biosynthesis that is irrelevant from the standpoint of neurodegeneration.

PG14 PrP. Tg(PG14) mice express PrP molecules containing an insertion of nine additional octapeptide repeats that causes a mixed CJD-GSS phenotype in humans (Owen et al., 1992; Duchen et al., 1993; Krasmann et al., 1995). These mice display a fatal neurological disorder that recapitulates several key features of the human disease, including ataxia, neuronal loss, and accumulation of an aggregated and protease-resistant form of PrP (Chiesa et al., 1998). Neuronal loss in Tg(PG14) mice takes the form of massive apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons that begins as early as 40 days of age in mice that are homozygous for the

transgene array, and that results in the onset of clinical symptoms by 65 days and death by 120–130 days (Chiesa et al., 2000). These features make it clear that the mutant PrP found in the brains of Tg(PG14) mice is highly neurotoxic.

What are the properties of PG14 PrP that could explain its neurotoxicity? The mutant protein displays several biochemical features characteristic of $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$, including protease-resistance, insolubility in nondenaturing detergents, and resistance of the C-terminal GPI anchor to cleavage by phospholipase (Chiesa et al., 1998). However, PG14 PrP appears to differ from conventional $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ in two crucial respects. First, whereas most kinds of $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ are resistant to high concentrations of PK (20–100 μg/ml), PG14 PrP is resistant only to relatively low levels of PK (1–5 μg/ml). Second, the protein does not appear to be infectious, since it cannot transmit the disease to other mice by intracerebral inoculation (Chiesa et al., unpublished results). Although PG14 PrP may constitute an unusual strain of prion with low protease resistance and low infectivity, another possibility is that this mutant protein represents an example of $\mathrm{PrP}^{\text {toxic }}$, a molecule that is pathogenic in mice but is distinct from $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ (Fig. 2, schemes 2 and 3).

If so, what are the molecular features that distinguish PG14 PrP and $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$? One possibility is that the two forms differ at the secondary or tertiary structural levels, for example if PG14 PrP possesses less β-sheet character than $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ (Fig. 4). Differences in the state of aggregation (quaternary structure) are also possible. For instance, PG14 PrP might form smaller oligomers than $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ or assemble into polymers with a different packing state (Fig. 4). An intriguing possibility is that PG14 PrP represents an intermediate state along the pathway from $\mathrm{PrP}^{C}$ to $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$. If so, then it might be possible to convert PG14 PrP to $\mathrm{PrP}^{S_{c}}$ by some physical or chemical manipulation *in vitro*.

Interestingly, when Tg(PG14) mice are inoculated with a mouse-adapted RML strain of scrapie, they accumulate a form of PG14 PrP that is resistant to high concentrations of PK and that is infectious upon serial passage (Chiesa et al., unpublished results). Thus, two forms of mutant PrP with identical primary sequence, but different degrees of protease resistance and infectivity are produced in Tg(PG14) mice, depending on whether the protein accumulates spontaneously or is “seeded” by exogenous prions. Structural analysis of these two isoforms will provide important insights into the molecular features of PrP that are essential for pathogenicity and the modifications associated with acquisition of infectivity.

FIG. 4. Hypothetical models for the structural differences between PrP<sup>toxic</sup>, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and PrP<sup>C</sup>. PrP<sup>toxic</sup> may differ from the other two species at the level of secondary or tertiary structure (for example, amount of β-sheet), and at the level of quaternary structure (number or packing of subunits in the oligomer). PrP<sup>C</sup> is assumed to be monomeric and largely α-helical.

neurodegenerative phenotype, with ataxia, spongi- form degeneration, astrocytic gliosis and PrP-contain- ing plaques in the brain (Hsiao *et al.*, 1990; Telling *et al.*, 1996a). Mice with high levels of transgene expres- sion die within 100 days of birth. Thus, as in Tg(PG14) mice, the mutant protein in these animals is pro- foundly neurotoxic. Interestingly, P101L PrP appears to differ in its properties from both conventional PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and from PG14 PrP. P101L PrP is sensitive to digestion with even low concentrations of PK and is detergent- soluble (Telling *et al.*, 1996a). In addition, P101L PrP from terminally ill mice appears to be infectious when inoculated into low-expressing Tg(P101L) hosts that do not spontaneously become ill, although it cannot transmit disease to nontransgenic mice (Hsiao *et al.*, 1994).

What is the relationship between P101L PrP, PG14 PrP, and PrP<sup>Sc</sup>? One possibility is that, like PG14 PrP, most P101L PrP represents a relatively protease-sen- sitive, noninfectious form that is pathogenic, but is structurally distinct from PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In this view, infectiv- ity in brain homogenates of Tg(P101L) mice might then be attributable to a small amount of P101L PrP that has assumed a PrP<sup>Sc</sup> state, but that is below the limits of detectability by biochemical assays or by transmission assays in nontransgenic mice. An alter- native possibility is that P101L PrP represents a novel,

PK-sensitive form of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, in other words, a form that is infectious like PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, but that differs from conven- tional PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in its biochemical properties.

Protease-sensitive PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. The existence of a PK-sen- sitive fraction of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is suggested by recent experi- ments using a conformation-dependent immunoassay to quantitate levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in hamsters inoculated with different scrapie strains. There is evidence that conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> involves a critical confor- mational change in a flexible region of the molecule lying between residues 90 and 120 (Riek *et al.*, 1997; Liu *et al.*, 1999). This change, which presumably re- flects increased β-sheet structure, causes the epitope for the monoclonal antibody 3F4 (which encompasses residues 109–112) to become inaccessible in the native structure of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, although reactivity with the anti- body can be restored when the protein is denatured (Peretz *et al.*, 1997). By measuring the ratio of 3F4 antibody reactivity in the native and denatured states, the total amount of conformationally altered PrP (pre- sumed to be equivalent to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) can be assayed with- out the necessity for PK treatment (Safar *et al.*, 1998). The difference between this value and the amount of conformationally altered PrP remaining after PK treat- ment then represents an estimate of the amount of PK-sensitive PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Using this method, it was found that PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in terminally ill hamsters consists of both
PK-resistant and PK-sensitive fractions, with the relative amount of the latter varying between 30 and 95%, depending on the scrapie strain used for inoculation (Safar et al., 1998).

The nature and significance of PK-sensitive PrP<sup>Sc</sup> remain to be determined. It could represent a highly toxic form of PrP that accumulates during the initial stages of prion replication, and is a primary trigger for neuronal death (Fig. 2, scheme 5). Conventional, PK-resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may then be a relatively innocuous end product of the replication process that appears later in the disease. Alternatively, PK-sensitive PrP<sup>Sc</sup> may have nothing to do with neurodegeneration, and may simply be a less polymerized precursor to the PK-resistant form, which is the main neurotoxic culprit. To distinguish these and other possibilities, it will now be crucial to assay the amounts of these two forms of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> during the course of prion diseases and to purify them and determine their structures.

# POSSIBLE CELLULAR PATHWAYS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRION-INDUCED NEURODEGENERATION

Regardless of whether PrP<sup>Sc</sup> or some alternative topological or structural form of PrP is the primary pathogenic entity in prion diseases, the question arises as to what cellular pathways are activated by these molecules that result in neurodegeneration. Although the pathological features of prion diseases are variable, neuronal loss is a common feature, and could account for some of the other abnormalities such as astrogliosis and vacuolation (DeArmond & Ironside, 1999). There is evidence that, in at least some prion diseases, apoptosis is the mechanism by which neurons die. This conclusion is based on morphological analysis and TUNEL staining of brain sections from scrapie-infected mice (Giese et al., 1995; Williams et al., 1997), from patients with sporadic, familial, and iatrogenic CJD (Dorandeu et al., 1998; Gray et al., 1999), and from Tg(PG14) mice which show a highly synchronous and dramatic wave of apoptosis of cerebellar granule neurons (Chiesa et al., 2000). In addition, neuronal cell cultures treated with the neurotoxic peptide PrP106–126 show evidence of apoptosis, including DNA laddering and activation of specific caspase pathways (Forloni et al., 1993; White et al., 2001).

How might abnormal forms of PrP damage neurons and trigger apoptosis? To address this question, it is ultimately necessary to employ cell culture systems where the relevant cellular and molecular pathways can be experimentally dissected. Several such model

systems are being used, but not all of them actually reproduce neuronal death in the culture dish. Nevertheless, certain biochemical abnormalities have been observed in these cultured cells that may be relevant to prion-associated neurodegeneration *in vivo*. Of course, it is always necessary to return to an animal model to test whether the pathways identified are, in fact, operative in the living organism, a requirement that has not yet been met in any of the studies described below.

**PrP106–126.** The one system where robust neuronal apoptosis has been observed *in vitro* involves treatment of cultured neurons with the synthetic peptide PrP106–126 (Forloni et al., 1993). The effect of this peptide has been reported to depend not only on PrP<sup>C</sup> expression by the neurons, but also on the presence of microglial cells in the culture, as evidenced by an attenuation of toxicity when cultures are pharmacologically depleted of microglia (Brown et al., 1994a, 1996). Studies of isolated microglia in culture indicate that PrP106–126 stimulates production of reactive oxygen species and cytokines by these cells, and it is hypothesized that it is these molecules which ultimately damage neurons (Brown et al., 1996; Combs et al., 1999; Peyrin et al., 1999). However, the role of microglia in the neurotoxicity of PrP106–126 has recently been questioned (N. Angeretti et al., in press). PrP106–126 also has several biochemical effects on neurons themselves which may contribute to its toxicity. These include inactivation of L-type calcium channels, which causes a decrease in intracellular calcium (Thellung et al., 2000); inhibition of glutathione reductase, which may enhance vulnerability to oxidative stress (Perovic et al., 1997; White et al., 1999); and stimulation of the synthesis of certain arachidonic acid metabolites (L.R. Stewart et al., in press). Although they provide a number of potential clues, these studies leave many questions unanswered. Aside from uncertainty about the *in vivo* relevance of PrP106–126, it is not clear how the peptide initiates any of the biochemical effects that have been observed, since there is little information available about where it is localized at the subcellular level and what cellular components it interacts with (Lin et al., 1997; Salmona et al., 1997). In addition, it remains to be determined which of the multiple biochemical alterations reported are primary, and which are secondary.

**Scrapie-infected cells.** Ideally, to study the cytopathic consequences of prion infection, it would be useful to have scrapie-infected cell lines that undergo degenerative changes *in vitro*. Several neuronally derived cell types have been successfully infected with scrapie prions, including mouse N2a neuroblastoma
cells (Butler *et al.*, 1988; Race *et al.*, 1988), rat PC12 pheochromocytoma cells (Rubinstein *et al.*, 1991), spontaneously immortalized hamster brain (HaB) cells (Taraboulos *et al.*, 1990), and T-antigen immortalized mouse hypothalamic neurons (GT1 cells) (Schätzl *et al.*, 1997). Once infected, all of these cells continuously produce low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> as they are propagated, as evidenced by the presence of protease resistant PrP on Western blots and by bioassays for infectivity.

Of these cell types, the only one that exhibits significant cytopathology as a result of infection is the GT1 line, a subpopulation of which exhibits the ultrastructural and biochemical characteristics of apoptosis accompanied by autophagy (Schätzl *et al.*, 1997). Infected N2a cells do show alterations in membrane fluidity and receptor-mediated signaling (Kristensson *et al.*, 1993; Wong *et al.*, 1996), and infected PC12 cells display decreased activity of neurotransmitter-synthesizing enzymes (Rubinstein *et al.*, 1991), but these defects do not cause morphological changes and do not affect the viability of the cells. These results suggest that generation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> within a cell adversely affects certain metabolic processes, but this only sometimes results in cell death. Possible explanations for the lack of significant pathology in most of the scrapie-infected lines is that the level of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is too low to compromise cell viability, or that cells resistant to the toxic insult of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> are selected during propagation in culture.

A possible role for ER quality control in prion pathogenesis. Secretory and membrane proteins are subject to a stringent surveillance mechanism that causes retention in the ER of misfolded or nonfunctional forms (for example those carrying mutations), and that prevents them from reaching the cell surface (Hurtley & Helenius, 1989; Ellgaard *et al.*, 1999). Proteins retained in the ER are then eliminated by a pathway that is now known to involve reverse translocation of the polypeptide chain into the cytoplasm followed by proteasomal degradation (Bonifacino & Weissman, 1998). Since PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and probably other neurotoxic forms of PrP are structurally distinct from PrP<sup>C</sup>, one might predict that these molecules would be recognized as “abnormal” by the ER quality control machinery. Consistent with this hypothesis, there are now two situations where PrP molecules are known to be retained in the ER and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. These examples provide new insights into potential cellular pathways involved in prion-related neuronal damage.

ER retention of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP. Previous cell biological studies of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP have been hampered by the fact that this species represents a minor proportion of all the PrP molecules in the cell; even when <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP-enhancing mutations are introduced into the central hydrophobic region, the proportion of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP is increased to at most 20–30% (Hegde *et al.*, 1999; Stewart & Harris, 2001). We have now been able to identify additional mutations that greatly increase the proportion of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP, thereby facilitating analysis of the subcellular localization of this form.

The starting point for this work was our discovery that <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP contains an uncleaved, N-terminal signal peptide in addition to a C-terminal GPI anchor (Stewart *et al.*, 2001; Stewart & Harris, 2001) (Fig. 3). Retention of the signal peptide is consistent with the fact that the N-terminus of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP fails to enter the ER lumen where signal peptidase is located. We subsequently found that substitution of an arginine residue for a conserved leucine residue in the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide dramatically increased the proportion of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP (Stewart *et al.*, 2001). Combining this mutation (L9R) with one in the central hydrophobic region (3AV) resulted in a molecule that was synthesized exclusively as <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP after in vitro translation as well as after expression in transfected cells. By analyzing cells expressing L9R/3AV PrP, we could then characterize the properties of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP independently of the other topological forms (Stewart *et al.*, 2001). We found that <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP is completely retained in the ER, based on biochemical and immunofluorescence data. In addition, we observed that the proteasome represented a major route for degradation of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP, as revealed by an increase in the amount of the protein after treatment of cells with specific proteasome inhibitors.

If, as has been proposed, <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP is a key neurotoxic intermediate in some prion diseases, our observations raise the possibility that it may damage neurons by activating stress-induced signaling pathways that are engaged by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER (Fig. 5). Some of these pathways, such as the unfolded protein response that results in upregulation of ER chaperone synthesis, are adaptive in nature. Others, however, such as induction of the transcription factor CHOP/GADD153 and phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF-2α, can kill cells by an apoptotic mechanism (Chapman *et al.*, 1998; Kaufman, 1999). Whether these or other ER stress pathways are activated by synthesis of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP in cultured cells and in brain will be an important subject for future investigation.

ER retention of PrP molecules carrying disease-associated mutations. How do mutant PrP molecules cause neurodegeneration in familial prion diseases? Since most pathogenic mutations do not increase the amount of <sup>Ctm</sup>PrP, other mechanisms must play a role.

FIG. 5. Possible pathways for cellular damage that could be initiated by ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}} \mathrm{PrP}$ and by PrP carrying disease-associated mutations. Both kinds of molecules are retained in the ER and degraded by the proteasome and so could trigger ER stress responses that can cause cells to undergo apoptosis. In addition, since ER retention of mutant PrP is incomplete, some of these molecules may continue along the secretory pathway to the cell surface, where they are known to aggregate and may cause cellular damage by other mechanisms.

To study these mechanisms, we have utilized transfected cell lines that express PrP molecules carrying disease-linked mutations. We and others have found that mutant PrPs expressed in these cells undergo spontaneous conversion to a state that displays several biochemical characteristics reminiscent of $\operatorname{PrP}^{S_{c}}$, including resistance to low concentrations of PK, insolubility in non-denaturing detergents, and resistance to cleavage of their GPI anchor by phospholipase (Lehmann & Harris, 1996a, 1996b; Daude et al., 1997; Singh et al., 1997; Priola & Chesebro, 1998; Narwa & Harris, 1999; Zanusso et al., 1999; Capellari et al., 2000; Chiesa & Harris, 2000). Thus, these cells are likely to be reproducing key features of the metabolism of mutant PrPs that are relevant to understanding the cellular basis of familial prion diseases. Although expression of mutant PrPs in cultured cells produces no obvious cytopathology, expression of some of the same proteins in transgenic mice is clearly neurotoxic, as demonstrated in Tg(PG14) and Tg(P101L) mice, thus arguing that the mechanisms identified *in vitro* may be relevant *in vivo*.

Using immunolabeling techniques as well as GFP fusion proteins, we have found that a number of mutations linked to familial prion diseases have a common effect on the trafficking of PrP in transfected cells, impairing delivery of the molecules to the cell surface, and causing a portion of them to accumulate in the ER (Ivanova et al., 2001). We have also observed that these mutant PrPs have a significantly shorter metabolic half-life than wild-type PrP, and that treatment of cells with proteasome inhibitors causes a marked accumulation of these proteins, and a significant prolongation of their metabolic half-lives (Drisaldi et al., in preparation). These two sets of results lead to the conclusion that mutant PrP molecules are subject to ER quality control mechanisms that cause them to be partially retained in the ER after their synthesis and subsequently degraded by the proteasome. Several results from other investigators support this contention (Petersen et al., 1996; Singh et al., 1997; Zanusso et al., 1999; Capellari et al., 2000; Jin et al., 2000; Negro et al., 2001). Presumably, ER retention and degradation depend on certain molecular features that are common to PrPs carrying disease-causing mutations. One of the $\operatorname{PrP}^{S_{c}}$-like biochemical properties of these proteins, phospholipase resistance, is acquired at the time the polypeptides are synthesized in the ER (Daude et al., 1997), and it is possible that this early molecular alteration

ation is recognized by the cell and triggers retention of the mutant protein along the secretory pathway.

How might ER retention of mutant PrPs damage neurons? In contrast to ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}} \mathrm{PrP}$, which is very efficiently retained in the ER, PrP molecules carrying disease-related mutations are only partially trapped, and a fraction is able to reach the cell surface. The PrP molecules responsible for neurodegeneration might be those that remain trapped inside the cell, or alternatively those that escape (Fig. 5). Retained PrP might trigger ER stress response pathways, as outlined for ${}^{\mathrm{Ctm}} \mathrm{PrP}$. Molecules that reach the surface are known to become aggregated and weakly PK-resistant (Daude *et al.*, 1997) and might damage cells by altering membrane properties, interacting abnormally with other proteins, or other mechanisms.

Whether PrP is subject to ER retention in nonfamilial forms of prion disease remains to be investigated. In cases that arise by infection, this would require that extracellular $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ gain access to the ER lumen in order to interact with newly synthesized $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{C}}$ molecules. While such a pathway would not be unprecedented (Rapak *et al.*, 1997), there is evidence that $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ formation in infected cells occurs on the cell surface or within an endocytic compartment, rather than in the ER (Caughey & Raymond, 1991; Borchelt *et al.*, 1992). Thus, it is possible that familial and nonfamilial prion diseases could involve different pathogenic mechanisms.

It will be important now to use transgenic models such as Tg(PG14) and Tg(P101L) mice, as well as patient material, to test whether ER retention of mutant PrP molecules occurs *in vivo* as it does in cultured cells. Interestingly, in Tg(PG14) mice, mutant PrP accumulates continuously as the animals age, until a threshold level is reached for the development of neuropathology and clinical symptoms (Chiesa *et al.*, 2000). This phenomenon, which is likely to occur in humans with familial prion diseases, could reflect a gradual decrement in the efficiency of the proteasomal degradation system during aging, with consequent build-up of mutant PrP in the ER. If ER retention of mutant PrPs does occur in familial prion diseases, then this finding would link these diseases to other human disorders, both inherited and sporadic, that are thought to involve the action of protein quality control mechanisms. These include other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Huntington's, and Parkinson's diseases, as well as disorders that affect peripheral organ systems such as cystic fibrosis, congenital hypothyroidism, and $\alpha_{1}$-anti-trypsin deficiency (Perlmutter, 1999; Sherman & Goldberg, 2001). The common theme in all of these diseases is thought

to be misfolding of a polypeptide that is recognized by the cell as abnormal and is then subject to retention in the ER (for secreted or membrane proteins) or sequestration in cytoplasmic inclusions (for soluble proteins), followed by proteasomal attack.

## SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The protein-only mechanism of replication embodied in the prion hypothesis was highly controversial when it was first proposed over 20 years ago. A great deal of experimental work in the ensuing period, utilizing biochemical, cellular, molecular biological, and transgenic techniques, has now made it likely that this hypothesis is correct, although the definitive experiment of creating infectivity *de novo* has not yet been successfully achieved. In contrast to the enormous effort devoted to defining the chemical nature of the infectious agent, however, much less attention has been paid to elucidating how prions actually damage the central nervous system. There is increasing evidence that, although $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ is the infectious form of PrP, it may not be the form that causes neurodegeneration. Several alternative molecular forms of PrP have been found to have neurotoxic properties in animal or cell models, but whether any of these actually operates as a pathogenic stimulus during the disease process remains to be proven. One important challenge will be to elucidate the physical structures of these molecules and determine whether they represent intermediates or by-products of the prion replication process. It will also be crucial to develop cell culture models that mimic prion-induced neuronal death, and to use these to further dissect the cellular pathways, such as ER stress, that may be activated by neurotoxic forms of PrP.

Ultimately, identifying the toxic forms of PrP and elucidating the mechanisms of prion-related neurodegeneration will be essential for designing effective therapies to treat these devastating disorders. If, for example, activation of ER stress response pathways by abnormal PrP proves to be an underlying cause of neurodegeneration, then pharmacological agents to block these pathways may prove efficacious. Conversely, if protease-sensitive $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ consisting of monomers or small oligomers, rather than highly aggregated, protease-resistant $\mathrm{PrP}^{\mathrm{Sc}}$ is the primary trigger for neuronal damage, then strategies aimed primarily at disaggregating PrP may be ineffective. In regard to therapeutics, it will be important now for prion researchers to catch up with Alzheimer's disease researchers, who have been thinking for many years

about what forms of Aβ are neurotoxic and how these can be eliminated by pharmacological intervention.

The recognition that pathogenic forms of PrP need not be infectious now firmly locates prion diseases in the same category as several other more common neurodegenerative disorders, including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, polyglutamine disorders, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. None of these other diseases is infectious, but all of them are thought to be caused by aberrant protein folding and the presence of protein aggregates that are rich in β-pleated sheets (Kaytor & Warren, 1999). It is plausible that pathogenic forms of PrP are also aggregated and/or β-rich and that they trigger cellular responses similar to those seen in the other neurodegenerative disorders. It has been pointed out that, although an amyloid-based disease like Alzheimer's is not transmissible, aggregates composed of Aβ, like those composed of PrPSc, are capable of nucleating the polymerization of monomeric subunits in a test tube (Jarrett & Lansbury, 1993; Koo et al., 1999). The fact that Aβ can assume a physical form that is neurotoxic, but that is not capable of seeding a self-propagating, infectious reaction *in vivo*, emphasizes that the distinction between pathogenicity and “infectivity” applies to neurodegenerative disorders other than those caused by prions.

The ability to discriminate neurotoxic and infectious forms of PrP also has a biological significance that extends beyond human and animal neurological diseases. It is now clear that the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* contains multiple proteins, none of which are homologous to PrP at the primary sequence level, that behave as prion-like elements, capable of transmitting biological information exclusively via changes in protein conformation (Wickner et al., 1999). Proteins with similar properties have been described in filamentous fungi, and it is likely that the prion phenomenon will be found to underlie an increasing number of processes in nature. A crucial realization from all of these studies is that the generation of prion states does not have to be detrimental to an organism and in fact can serve an important role in the life cycle and evolution of a species (True & Lindquist, 2000). It may be, therefore, that mammals are unique in having a toxic response to prion infection. Furthermore, it is possible that our cells contain other proteins besides PrP, yet to be discovered, that can assume a prion-like form without eliciting disease, and this molecular transformation could serve important physiological functions.
