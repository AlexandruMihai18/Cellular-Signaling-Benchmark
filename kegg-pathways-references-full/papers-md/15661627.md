**Opioids: cellular mechanisms of tolerance and physical dependence**

Chris P Bailey¹ and Mark Connor²

---

Morphine and other opioids are used and abused for their analgesic and rewarding properties. Tolerance to these effects develops over hours/days to weeks, as can physical and psychological dependence. Despite much investigation, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance and dependence remain elusive. Recent studies examining μ-opioid receptor desensitization and trafficking have revealed several potential mechanisms for acute receptor regulation. Other studies have reported changes in many other proteins that develop during chronic opioid treatment or withdrawal and such changes may be partly responsible for the cellular and synaptic adaptations to prolonged opioid exposure. While these studies have added to our knowledge of the cellular processes participating in opioid tolerance and dependence, the challenge remains to integrate these observations into a coherent explanation of the complex changes observed in whole animals chronically exposed to opioids.

**Introduction**

Opioid drugs are used clinically as unsurpassed analgesic agents but are also illegally abused on the street to induce a sense of well-being and euphoria. Tolerance to opioids, defined as a loss of effect following repeated treatments such that a higher dose is required for equivalent effect, limits the analgesic efficacy of these drugs [1] and contributes to the social problems surrounding recreational opioid abuse. In animals, tolerance to the anti-nociceptive effects of opioids can be observed even after a single dose, and continues to develop over many weeks of drug treatment. A complex interplay of events occurring at the single cell level and also in neuronal networks are likely to contribute to whole animal opioid tolerance, with distinct mechanisms being more important at different times during chronic exposure.

This review summarizes key recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of cellular tolerance, which is the reduced response to opioid agonists by μ-opioid receptor (MOR)-expressing neurons during chronic agonist exposure. Cellular tolerance following prolonged opioid receptor activation could result from alterations in receptor coupling, receptor number, the amount of effector protein or the capacity of an effector to be regulated by opioid receptors. Recent work has focused largely on the idea that the capacity of agonists to recruit various MOR regulatory events is a major determinant of their propensity to induce both tolerance and dependence. Concurrent work is increasingly promoting the idea that tolerance and dependence/withdrawal are molecularly separable phenomena, and therefore this review also covers recent studies examining possible cellular substrates of physical dependence, including adaptations unmasked on withdrawal from chronic opioid treatment.

**Receptor desensitization and trafficking**

The analgesic and rewarding properties of opioid drugs occur through activation of MORs [2]. MORs are Gᵢ/o-coupled receptors and, like many other G-protein-coupled receptors, can undergo rapid desensitization and internalization following exposure to agonist [3*,4,5]. These acute receptor regulatory processes have assumed a central role in discussions into the development of cellular tolerance to morphine and other MOR agonists [4]. The generally accepted mechanism underlying MOR desensitization and internalization begins with phosphorylation of activated receptors by G-protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRKs), followed by arrestin binding. At this point, the

receptor is in a desensitized state at the plasma membrane. Arrestin-bound receptors can then be internalized via a clathrin-dependent pathway, and either recycled to the cell surface or downregulated [3*,4,6] (Figure 1).

In heterologous expression systems, opioid receptor desensitization can also be modulated by second mes-

Pathways for acute μ-opioid receptor regulation. The phenomena of opioid receptor activation, uncoupling and internalization are well described, but the precise mechanisms underlying the experimental observations are largely undefined. The pink shaded area represents states of the receptor that are likely to be uncoupled from signalling. Although it is assumed that once MOR is phosphorylated and bound by arrestin it is functionally desensitized, alternative mechanisms of desensitization might also occur. Opioid receptors are basally phosphorylated, but the kinases responsible for this are unknown. A role for serine/threonine protein kinases such as protein kinase A, calmodulin-dependent protein kinase and protein kinase C in receptor desensitization and/or the recruitment of GRK-dependent receptor trafficking have been suggested, but they have yet to be defined in detail. Similarly, specific tyrosine kinases that phosphorylate the MOR have not been identified. Approximately 80% of MORs that undergo endocytosis are recycled; the remaining 20% are degraded in lysosomes.

recycling are also ill-defined. Nonetheless, kinase-mediated rapid receptor desensitization is likely to be an obligatory event preceding the development of cellular tolerance.

Indirect evidence that arrestin-dependent MOR desensitization contributes to morphine tolerance *in vivo* comes from studies in arrestin-3 and GRK3 knockout mice. In arrestin-3 knockout mice, the acute antinociceptive response to morphine or heroin was enhanced and both acute and chronic tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine was significantly attenuated [8,9]. However, arrestin-3 deletion had no effect on the acute antinociceptive potency of etorphine, fentanyl or methadone [8–10]. By contrast, deletion of GRK3 produced a modest inhibition of the development of tolerance to fentanyl, but not to morphine, in antinociceptive tests. Desensitization of fentanyl actions on population responses in hippocampal slices was also abolished [11], whereas desensitization of morphine actions was only slightly attenuated. Significantly, morphine withdrawal was not affected by deletion of arrestin-3, and loss of GRK3 did not affect withdrawal following chronic fentanyl treatment, suggesting that the development of tolerance and dependence are separable phenomena.

In neurons, the molecular details of MOR desensitization have not been defined, although a single study in nucleus raphe magnus neurons reported that desensitization following short (<15 s) applications of DAMGO ([D-Ala2, N-Me-Phe4, Gly5-ol]-enkephalin; a MOR agonist) or morphine could be reduced by intracellular application of a GRK2 inhibitory peptide [12].

### Agonist-induced rapid MOR desensitization and internalization

In isolated cells, high efficacy MOR agonists such as DAMGO have consistently been shown to cause MOR desensitization over seconds to minutes [13**,14*,15, 16*,17,18]. However, this is not always the case for the less efficacious agonist morphine. In locus coeruleus (LC) neurons, an agonist’s ability to produce rapid desensitization of potassium channel activation was found to correlate with its effectiveness at promoting receptor internalization in HEK-293 cells [13**,14*]. Notably, morphine produced little desensitization in LC neurons or MOR internalization in HEK-293 cells, whereas DAMGO, methadone and met-enkephalin produced both substantial rapid desensitization in LC neurons and receptor internalization in HEK-293 cells. In contrast to effects observed in LC neurons, morphine produced a similar level of rapid desensitization in pituitary-derived AtT-20 cells as did DAMGO and methadone. However, morphine caused minimal MOR internalization in AtT-20 cells, as in HEK-293 cells, in direct contrast to the robust internalization seen with DAMGO and methadone [16*]. Further, a point mutation in MOR (T180A)

resulted in a receptor that internalized normally following DAMGO exposure, but which did not exhibit DAMGO-induced desensitization when expressed in AtT-20 cells [17]. Thus rapid MOR desensitization does not always correlate with receptor internalization, most notably in cells challenged with morphine. The specific role of MOR internalization in MOR desensitization is not clear. Receptors are likely to be desensitized when still in the plasma membrane following receptor phosphorylation and/or arrestin binding, and internalization of the desensitized receptor might be fundamentally important for receptor resensitization, rather than being a significant component of desensitization.

It is not known why morphine causes rapid MOR desensitization in some cell systems but not in others. It is possible that this is a result of the varying intracellular environment of different cells, raising the possibility that opioid receptor desensitization is mediated by different processes, and that different protein kinases are differentially activated or expressed in different cell types. For example, a recent study has shown that morphine can be converted into a rapidly desensitizing MOR agonist in LC neurons when protein kinase C is activated by phorbol esters or concomitant stimulation of Gq-coupled receptors [18].

#### Why does morphine cause minimal rapid MOR internalization?

The reason why morphine is less effective at producing MOR internalization remains obscure, although there is increasing evidence that morphine is not as effective as agonists such as DAMGO or etorphine at initiating specific steps in the GRK/arrestin pathway [7,10,19*]. Indeed, morphine has been shown to induce substantially less phosphorylation of a putative GRK phosphorylation site (Ser375) in heterologously expressed MORs [19*]. Furthermore, experiments in embryonic fibroblasts taken from arrestin-2/3 knockout mice, which completely lack native arrestin, confirmed that morphine activation of heterologously expressed MORs resulted in less translocation of fluorescent arrestin constructs to the plasma membrane than did other opioid agonists [10]. An alternative explanation for the differences between morphine and DAMGO emerged following reports that DAMGO, but not morphine, activated phospholipase D₂ (PLD₂) [20**,21]. Activation of recombinant PLD₂ in HEK-293 cells facilitated MOR internalization, whereas inhibition of this enzyme blocked it. Native MORs have not yet been shown to couple to PLD₂ in neurons, but this pathway is the first reported to be activated by DAMGO but not morphine. Interestingly, a study modelling ligand/receptor/effecter interactions suggested that the failure of morphine to recruit receptor regulatory mechanisms, including internalization, could be explained largely on kinetic grounds; this intriguing theory deserves more experimental attention [22].

Does morphine cause greater tolerance because of less MOR internalization?

Equianalgesic doses of opioid drugs do not produce equivalent amounts of tolerance in the whole animal. In particular, tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine is greater than that seen with higher efficacy agonists such as etorphine or fentanyl [23]. Although this could be attributable to the fact that morphine would occupy more receptors than etorphine or fentanyl at equianalgesic doses, this finding, coupled with the repeated observation that morphine produces little MOR internalization, has generated two contrasting ideas concerning the role of MOR internalization in the development of cellular tolerance and dependence *in vivo*. If MOR resensitization is dependent upon internalization and dephosphorylation in endosomes (see Figure 1), then morphine might produce greater cellular tolerance because desensitized morphine-bound MORs cannot be internalized and resensitized; the other hypothesis suggests that, because morphine does not promote receptor internalization, receptors remain at the plasma membrane and continue to signal, thus disproportionately recruiting adaptations that induce cellular tolerance [24].

The idea that MOR resensitization following morphine treatment is comparatively less than with other opioid drugs is most strongly supported by evidence from cells heterologously expressing high densities of MORs. In these cells, resensitization of the MOR response following morphine-induced desensitization was significantly slower than resensitization following DAMGO treatment [19*,25,26]. This has been attributed to relatively slower dephosphorylation of morphine-activated receptors compared with DAMGO-activated receptors [19*], although direct evidence for MOR dephosphorylation in endosomes is still lacking. Unfortunately, the interpretation of these studies is significantly hampered by a lack of correlation between the time-course of MOR desensitization (maximal in approximately 4 h) and receptor internalization (maximal in less than 30 min), as well as by the failure to demonstrate any correlation between receptor re-insertion and recovery of agonist responses [3*].

The notion that morphine produces more profound cellular adaptations than do other agonists because of its reduced capacity to initiate receptor internalization remains controversial [14*,15,24,27]. One cellular consequence of chronic morphine is ‘superactivation’ of adenyl cyclase (AC); it is claimed that this occurs as an adaptive response to prolonged MOR activation by morphine [24]. However, acute ‘superactivation’ of AC is an adaptation produced by all MOR agonists, including those that cause rapid MOR desensitization and internalization. Superactivation might be a correlate of the upregulated AC activity reported in chronically opioid-treated animals, but this *in vivo* phenomenon is also likely to involve increased AC protein [28]. Morphine produced greater AC superactivation in HEK-293 cells transfected with MORs than it did in cells expressing mutant MORs that internalized in response to morphine; however, the differences in AC superactivation produced by methadone acting at these internalizing and non-internalizing MOR variants was modest [24]. Furthermore, the observation that a low concentration of DAMGO reduced morphine-induced AC superactivation by ‘dragging’ MORs into the cell via activation of one half of a putative MOR dimer [27] could not be reproduced using other measurements of receptor desensitization in neurons or receptor internalization in HEK-293 cells [14*,15].

The relationship between processes involved in MOR desensitization, internalization and trafficking and the development of cellular tolerance in neurons remains to be established. Studies in neurons have not yet directly correlated MOR desensitization with receptor internalization, and as the vast majority of desensitization and internalization studies have focused on the first hour of agonist treatment we do not know how the processes underlying rapid desensitization relate to loss of function following longer-term opioid agonist treatment. There are, however, hints that the mechanisms of acute receptor desensitization and resensitization are altered by chronic morphine treatment of animals, because the recovery of MOR responses in LC neurons following an acute desensitizing stimulus is slower and less complete in neurons from morphine-treated animals than in controls [29]. Further studies in neurons are essential, and the observation that morphine produces redistribution and aggregation of MORs in the dendrites but not soma of cultured nucleus accumbens neurons [30*] reinforces the idea that commonly utilized non-neuronal cell models might not be appropriate for studying opioid receptor regulation owing to their lack of crucial components of regulatory pathways that exist in neurons.

### Other proteins that may affect cellular tolerance

The rewarding, dependence-producing and analgesic effects of opioids result from activation of MORs in several brain regions simultaneously. Functional and gene expression studies have suggested an ever-growing number of target proteins that are likely to be involved in *in vivo* adaptations to chronic opioid treatment. These proteins and their impact on opioid tolerance have been studied by diverse techniques, including inhibition with pharmacological antagonists, knockdown of expression with antisense oligonucleotides and genomic deletion in mice.

#### δ-opioid receptors

Although morphine is a preferential MOR agonist, evidence suggests that other opioid receptors and endogenous ligands, particularly those of the δ-opioid receptor (DOR) system, are intimately involved in

responses to acute and chronic morphine. Deletion of the genes for DORs and preproenkephalin, the precursor of both μ and δ endogenous peptide agonists, inhibits the development of morphine tolerance in antinociceptive tests without affecting the development of adaptations expressed during morphine withdrawal [31,32]. Although the potency of morphine is unchanged in DOR knockout mice [31], morphine analgesia in wild-type animals is made more effective by co-administration of either DOR agonists or antagonists [33]. MORs and DORs exist on overlapping populations of neurons in pain-modulating regions of the CNS, and an intriguing explanation for MOR/DOR synergy is that MOR and DOR can exist as heterodimers [33,34]. More evidence for a close association between MORs and DORs comes from studies showing that treatment of rats or mice with MOR agonists for several days leads to translocation of DORs to neuronal plasma membranes [35,36]. In sensory neurons, activation of DORs leads to translocation of intracellular DORs to the cell surface via membrane fusion of vesicles that also contain the pro-nociceptive peptide calcitonin gene-related peptide, the release of which might be expected to oppose the antinociceptive effect of morphine and thus could contribute to morphine tolerance [37].

**Neurokinins and other neurotransmitters**

Genetic deletion of an ever-growing number of neurotransmitters and/or their receptors also modifies the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine, the rewarding effects of morphine and the expression of opioid withdrawal [38], although in most cases the anatomical substrates and molecular mechanisms of these effects are not established. The most intriguing studies implicate recently identified neurotransmitters such as orexin, as well as well-known transmitters such as neurokinins [39,40]. Neurokinin-1 receptor (NK₁) knockout mice do not self-administer morphine or exhibit conditioned place preference to morphine administration, although their withdrawal signs are largely preserved [40,41]. Possible target sites for NK₁-mediated effects include the nucleus accumbens and amygdala [42]. Putative heterodimerization between NK₁ receptors and MORs affects receptor trafficking in HEK-293 cells, but the role of heterodimerization with NK₁ receptors in normal MOR function remains to be established [43].

**G protein regulator and receptor trafficking proteins**

Deletion of genes encoding proteins involved in regulating G protein function (e.g. RGS-9) [44] or receptor desensitization and trafficking (e.g. arrestin-3) [8–10,45] have profound effects on the potency of morphine to produce reward or analgesia, as well as the development of tolerance. There is considerable evidence that chronic opioid treatment can affect neuronal mRNA and protein levels of RGS [44,46,47] and GRKs [48–50], as well as

the protein level and phosphorylation state of arrestin-3 [45,48,51,52]. Evidence from heterologous systems indicates that RGS proteins are also involved in opioid-induced AC supersensitization [53,54]. However, although it is tempting to speculate that disruption of the direct interaction between MORs and these proteins abrogates adaptations to chronic opioid treatment, deletion of these proteins will affect the signalling of multiple G-protein-coupled receptors both on morphine-sensitive neurons and on other neurons in MOR-related circuits; currently, there are no data from RGS-9, GRK3 or arrestin-3 knockout animals to demonstrate that cellular or synaptic adaptations to chronic morphine treatment are affected. Direct evidence that an RGS protein in MOR-containing neurons contributes to morphine tolerance comes from a study that demonstrated increased RGS4 proteins levels following chronic morphine treatment; intracellular application of this protein attenuated the acute response to morphine in these neurons [46].

**Synaptic transmission and plasticity**

It is perhaps not surprising that deletion of genes encoding proteins involved in synaptic transmission and synaptic plasticity, such as the NR2A subunit of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor [55,56], also affects the development and expression of morphine tolerance and dependence. Clever experiments have extended the utility of gene knockout mice by re-introducing the deleted gene into specific brain regions using either virally mediated transfer (e.g. for RGS-9) or electroporation (e.g. for NR2A). NR2A re-introduction in the ventral tegmental area and periaqueductal grey (PAG) regions partially restored the expression of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of morphine, whereas re-introduction into the nucleus accumbens partially restored morphine withdrawal signs [55]. In addition to the potential role of RGS proteins in tolerance, selective expression in the nucleus accumbens of an RGS-9 construct also abolished the exaggerated sensitivity to the rewarding properties of morphine present in RGS-9 knockout mice [44].

**Adaptive changes following chronic opioid treatment that might underlie physical dependence**

Adaptive changes in neurons and neuronal communication are a hallmark of chronic morphine treatment; such adaptations must underlie altered behaviour associated with morphine dependence and withdrawal syndrome, as well as drug-induced craving and relapse to drug use (see also review by Weiss in this issue).

**Adaptations affecting neuronal excitability and synaptic transmission**

The most well-described consequence of morphine withdrawal is a rebound increase in cAMP levels, probably

produced by ‘superactivation’ of AC and upregulation of the amount of enzyme. There is also evidence that activation of TrkB receptors by brain-derived neurotrophic factor can contribute to cAMP superactivation in LC neurons [57]. Earlier studies are reviewed by Williams, Christie and Manzoni [28], and the strong evidence for enhanced γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated synaptic transmission during morphine withdrawal in brain regions such as the PAG, ventral tegmental area, nucleus accumbens and dorsal raphe is discussed in detail. AC-mediated effects on GABA release are largely mediated by protein kinase A, but some effects are attributable to the conversion of cAMP to adenosine (Figure 2), [58]. For example, in mouse (but not rat) PAG, there is a protein kinase A-dependent increase in GABA release and a concomitant elevation of extracellular adenosine, which acts on inhibitory A₁ receptors to reduce excess GABA release [59]. Inhibitors of cAMP metabolism and nucleoside transport block adenosine-dependent inhibition of GABA release, implying that the withdrawal-induced adenosine tone results

from excessive AC activation. Another study has demonstrated enhanced adenosine inhibition of synaptic inputs to nucleus accumbens neurons [60], an effect attributed to a reduction in adenosine transport.

Although there is considerable evidence for adaptations to chronic morphine treatment at the level of nerve terminals, little progress has been made in elucidating the mechanisms that underlie changes in neuronal cell body firing rates that occur during opioid withdrawal [28]. The identity of ‘cation channels’ proposed to underlie withdrawal excitation of opioid-sensitive PAG or LC neurons has not been established; however, the recent observation that currents mediated by the dopamine transporter can profoundly affect the firing rate of dopaminergic neurons [61] indicates that the activity of similar transporters (e.g., those for noradrenaline or GABA) during opioid withdrawal is worth examining, particularly in light of the dramatic changes in neurotransmitter release during this process. There is evidence for alterations of glutamate transporter expression following

Hyperexcitability and enhanced transmitter release during opioid withdrawal. Under normal conditions, MOR activation can result in inhibition of AC, inhibition of Ca²⁺ channels and opening of voltage-gated K⁺ channels. Following withdrawal from chronic opioid treatment, many neurons exhibit hyperexcitability at the soma, a process thought to be mediated, at least in part, by induction of a cation current through protein kinase A (PKA) activation following rebound cAMP superactivation or by increased levels of AC. Additionally, transmitter release at the nerve terminal can be enhanced during opioid withdrawal. The mechanisms underlying this process include rebound elevated cAMP levels or increased amounts of AC protein, causing enhanced transmitter release through PKA activation. Upregulated AC is, in turn, more sensitive to inhibition by opioids. In addition, enhanced cAMP production can also enhance extracellular levels of adenosine, causing inhibition of transmitter release through adenosine A₁ receptors. Figure adapted from [28].

chronic morphine treatment in glia [62], spinal cord neurons [63] and hippocampal neurons [64], although it is not known whether these changes in glutamate transporters occur in opioid-sensitive neurons.

**Transcription factors underlying adaptations to opioids**

Synaptic plasticity is thought to be important in mediating certain behavioural effects of chronic opioid treatment (see review by Jones and Bonci in this issue). Activation of the cAMP-activated transcription factor — cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) — is heavily implicated in various forms of synaptic plasticity and, because elevations in cAMP have long been considered central to the expression of opioid withdrawal, CREB is thought to be important for withdrawal-dependent synaptic plasticity [65]. Region-specific increases in phosphorylated CREB have been demonstrated in the rat brain following morphine withdrawal, notably in the nucleus accumbens, amygdala and hypothalamus [66]; manipulating CREB activity in the nucleus accumbens affects behavioural responses to rewarding stimuli, including morphine [67]. Few reports have linked changes in CREB activity to any specific cellular adaptation to acute or chronic opioid treatment, with the exception of one study that demonstrated attenuated hyperexcitability in LC neurons following morphine withdrawal in CREB1 knockout mice, or in mice with a CREB1 mutant that showed decreased transcriptional activity [68].

**Mitogen-activated protein kinases**

Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are activated by many G-protein-coupled receptors, including opioid receptors, and their activation has been implicated in synaptic plasticity [69]. Acute morphine treatment increases levels of phosphorylated (activated) MAPK in some brain regions including the anterior cingulate, somatosensory and association cortices and LC, but decreases activated MAPK levels in the nucleus accumbens and amygdala [70,71]. Interestingly, with the exception of the LC, the increases in activated MAPKs were seen in neurons adjacent to those expressing MORs, suggesting that opioid modulation of intercellular communication is important in modulating MAPK activity.

**Conclusions**

The cellular consequences of MOR activation are well understood, and significant progress has been made in understanding the acute regulation of MORs heterologously expressed in cell lines. Furthermore, the involvement of diverse neurotransmitter systems and intracellular signalling proteins in acute and chronic opioid actions has been revealed by the use of knockout mice. However, the challenge for biologists interested in understanding the consequences of chronic morphine exposure is to establish which of the defined actions of morphine at the molecular level are important for producing cellular tolerance and synaptic adaptation to morphine, and which of these adaptations give rise to the persistently altered behaviours found in animals and humans exposed to chronic opioids. The next few years should yield further progress towards defining the cellular molecular processes underlying the behavioural adaptations to opioid drugs.

**Update**

The mechanism linking upregulated AC activity and morphine-withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability of PAG neurons has been established in a recent paper [72], which demonstrated that most PAG neurons in brain slices from morphine-dependent mice exhibit a novel opioid-sensitive cation conductance following morphine withdrawal. This conductance was produced by a PKA-dependent increase in the activity of the GABA transporter (GAT-1), and inhibitors of GAT-1 blocked the withdrawal-induced hyperexcitability of PAG neurons. GAT-1 inhibitors are currently used to treat epilepsy; this study suggests they may also have efficacy in treating opioid withdrawal symptoms.

This paper showed that DAMGO stimulation of heterologously expressed MOR activated heterologously expressed PLD₂, and that this interaction was essential for MOR endocytosis. Intriguingly, morphine did not stimulate PLD₂, providing the first demonstration of a second messenger pathway differentially activated by MOR agonists, thereby providing a potential explanation for the relative inability of morphine to promote MOR endocytosis.
