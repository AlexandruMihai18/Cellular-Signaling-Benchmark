Notch proteins are used repeatedly to direct developmental cell fate decisions in multiple organs. During hematopoiesis and immune development, Notch is critical for T/B lineage specification and for generation of splenic marginal zone B cells. In early embryonic development, Notch is crucial for generating hematopoietic stem cells. Emerging data suggest that Notch may also modulate the differentiation and activity of peripheral T cells. Understanding the specific regulation of the Notch pathway in different contexts and its interaction with other signaling pathways remains an important challenge to comprehend the full spectrum of Notch effects. In this review, we critically assess recent findings regarding the function of Notch in the hematolymphoid system.

Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway controlling diverse aspects of development and tissue homeostasis. The best-characterized function of Notch in the immune system is its role in lymphopoiesis, where it is required for T cell commitment from a multipotent progenitor. However, recent findings implicate Notch in additional cell fate decisions: the generation of embryonic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and splenic marginal zone B cells (MZB). In addition, Notch may also influence adult HSC homeostasis and play a role in mature lymphocytes, although the spectrum and physiological relevance of these activities require further clarification. In this review, we critically discuss the role of Notch in immune development and function, with an emphasis on recent findings.

## Notch Signaling

Mammals have four Notch receptors encoded by four different genes (Notch1–4). Notch receptors are single pass transmembrane proteins that are cleaved within the trans-Golgi network during biosynthesis to yield a heterodimeric complex. Extracellular Notch contains epidermal growth factor-like repeats that bind Notch ligands, and LIN12/Notch repeats that likely prevent ligand-independent signaling. Intracellular Notch (ICN) contains several functional domains mediating Notch signal transduction. These include the RAM domain and ankyrin repeats that interact with downstream effector proteins, nuclear localization sequences, and a C-terminal PEST sequence regulating protein stability.

Notch1–2 but not Notch3–4 contain a C-terminal transcriptional activation domain.

Notch signaling converts a transmembrane receptor into a nuclear transcriptional coactivator (Figure 1). This multistep process begins with receptor-ligand interactions between adjacent cells. There are five Notch ligands (Jagged1, Jagged2, Delta-like1, Delta-like3, and Delta-like4) that show limited specificity for individual Notch receptors ex vivo. Receptor-ligand interaction initiates two successive cleavages resulting in the release of ICN. The first cleavage, mediated by an ADAM metalloprotease, occurs external to the transmembrane domain. The second cleavage occurs within the transmembrane domain and is mediated by a multiprotein complex with γ-secretase activity whose components include presenilin and nicastrin. Blocking γ-secretase activity with pharmacologic inhibitors or genetic inactivation of presenilins or nicastrin prevents Notch signaling (Li et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2000). Following cleavage, ICN translocates to the nucleus, where it binds the transcription factor CSL (for CBF1/RBP-Jκ in mammals, Suppressor of Hairless in Drosophila, and Lag-1 in C. elegans). In the absence of ICN, CSL binds corepressors and inhibits transcription. ICN displaces corepressors, recruits coactivators, and activates transcription. Proteins of the Mastermind-like family (MAML) form a complex with ICN and CSL, and behave as potent transcriptional coactivators, probably by recruiting p300 and other proteins into the transcriptional activation complex (Fryer et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2000, 2002). Additional members of this large (~1.5 MDa) transcriptional complex are likely to be discovered (Jeffries et al., 2002).

The direct effect of Notch activation is increased transcription of Notch target genes. These include genes that are activated in a variety of cell types by Notch signaling, such as the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors of the HES (Hairy-Enhancer of Split) and HERP (HES-related repressor protein) families that encode transcriptional repressors. Although their precise functions are not known, expression of HES and HERP appears split between the descendants of the hemangioblast; HES predominates in hematopoietic lineages and HERP predominates in vascular lineages (reviewed in Iso et al., 2003). Notch also activates genes that are restricted to specific cell types, such as the preTCRα gene (pTα). A major challenge is identifying the spectrum of Notch responsive genes, and determining when their expression reflects Notch activity. This is complicated by Notch-independent expression of many putative targets, such as HES, and it is not clear that expression of a single gene can be used to indicate Notch signaling. In addition, CSL-independent Notch signaling may occur; however, neither the context nor mechanism is known (Martinez Arias et al., 2002).

In addition to the requirement for receptor-ligand interactions, Notch signaling is modulated by extracellular, cytoplasmic, and nuclear proteins (Figure 1). At the extracellular level, Notch undergoes posttranslational modification through the addition of O-linked fucose on serine and threonine residues within the EGF repeats,

Figure 1. Schematic Representation of Notch

Notch is a heterodimeric cell surface receptor. Initiation of signaling requires interaction with one of several ligands (Delta-like or Jagged) present on an adjacent cell. Posttranslational modification of the extracellular EGF repeats is mediated by the glycosyltransferase Fringe and serves to modulate receptor-ligand interactions. Following interaction with ligand, Notch is enzymatically cleaved, releasing the cytoplasmic fragment referred to as ICN (for intracellular Notch). ICN then translocates to the nucleus where it binds to the transcription factor CSL. Under basal conditions, CSL acts as a transcriptional repressor, but in the presence of ICN it is able to recruit coactivators (such as Mastermind-like proteins, MAML) and become part of a transcriptional activation complex containing p300. It is not known whether these interactions occur after or before binding of DNA to CSL. Several Notch target genes have been identified, while many remain unknown. Notch signaling is also regulated through interactions with other cellular proteins such as Deltex, Nrarp, MINT, and SEL-10.

ICN (intracellular Notch); CSL (CBF1/RBP-Jk, Suppressor of Hairless, Lag-1); MINT (Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein); Dtx (Deltex); MAML (Mastermind-like proteins); Nrarp (Notch related ankyrin repeat protein); DLL (Delta-like); DSL (Delta, Serrate, Lin); EGFR (Epidermal growth factor repeats); LNR (Lin, Notch Repeats); ANK (ankyrin repeat domain); and TAD (transactivation domain).

which is essential for Notch signaling (Okajima et al., 2003). Further modification of these O-linked fucose residues by the addition of N-acetylglucosamine occurs through the glycosyltransferase, Fringe (Haltiwanger and Stanley, 2002). Studies indicate that Fringe differentially modulates ligand-mediated signaling, potentiating Delta-like1 and inhibiting Jagged1 signaling (Hicks et al., 2000). Nrarp, a recently described protein that is highly conserved among vertebrates, is a small protein containing two ankyrin repeats and a unique domain. It forms a complex with ICN and CSL and has differential effects on Notch signaling depending upon the system used. In murine thymocyte progenitors, constitutive Nrarp expression blocks Notch signaling and subsequent T

cell commitment (Yun and Bevan, 2003). Deltex is another modulator of Notch signaling that was originally described as a positive Notch regulator in *Drosophila*. The precise subcellular localization of Deltex and its mode of interaction with Notch remain controversial. In mice, transgenic Deltex1 expression antagonizes Notch1 function in the thymus (Izon et al., 2002; Yun and Bevan, 2003) but not Notch2 function during splenic B cell development (Maillard et al., submitted). Moreover, Deltex1 is a transcriptional target of Notch signals in developing thymocytes, where its physiologic role remains unknown. Msx2-interacting nuclear target protein (MINT, SHARP in humans) inhibits Notch-mediated transcriptional activation by competing with ICN for binding to

Figure 2. Notch Signaling during Hematopoietic Development and in the Immune System

Notch signaling plays an important role in cell fate decisions at several steps of hematopoietic and lymphocyte development, such as the generation of the earliest hematopoietic stem cells in the embryo, the T/B lineage decision in the thymus, and the development of splenic marginal zone B cells. Other potential roles are controversial (see text). Potential functions in mature lymphocytes have been less well characterized but may be important as well.

HB (hemangioblast); HSC (hematopoietic stem cell); CLP (common lymphoid progenitor); ETP (early T lineage progenitor); DN (CD4⁻CD8⁻ double-negative thymocytes); T reg (CD4⁺CD25⁺ regulatory T cells); TrB (transitional B cell); FB (follicular B cell); MZB (marginal zone B cell); and APC (antigen-presenting cell).

CSL (Kuroda et al., 2003; Oswald et al., 2002). MINT⁻/⁻ hematopoietic chimeras showed an increased marginal zone to follicular B cell ratio, suggesting a physiological role of MINT as a negative regulator of Notch signaling in the spleen. However, MINT is also highly expressed in the thymus (Oswald et al., 2002), and whether it functions as a Notch antagonist in this context remains to be demonstrated.

### Notch and Hematopoietic Stem Cells

Recent studies implicate Notch in the generation of the earliest embryonic hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), perhaps as they differentiate from hemangioblasts or hemogenic endothelium (Kumano et al., 2003; Figure 2). During embryogenesis, hematopoietic progenitors are first found in the extraembryonic yolk sac (YS) in association with a wave of primitive hematopoiesis, and subsequently in the embryo itself where they give rise to definitive hematopoiesis. The aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region is an important site for the generation of embryonic HSCs and subsequent definitive hematopoiesis. Hirai's group (Kumano et al., 2003) found that splancho-pleural explant cultures from Notch1-deficient but not Notch2-deficient mice were markedly impaired in their ability to generate hematopoietic colonies. As these cultures include the AGM region, this result suggests that Notch1 is required for definitive hematopoiesis. Primitive hematopoiesis was partially preserved, but cells isolated from both the yolk sac and the AGM region of Notch1 knockout embryos were unable to rescue conditioned newborn recipients, indicating a defect in HSC activity. Importantly, the phenotype was reproduced in the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors, but only until up to E10.5 of embryogenesis, suggesting that Notch activity is not required once the initial HSC pool has been established. Together, these results suggest a critical function for Notch1 signaling to generate the earliest HSCs. Precisely how Notch shapes embryonic HSC development and how it interacts with other actors in this process, such as the transcription factors SCL/Tal-1, LMO2, GATA-2, and AML1, awaits further studies. Although Notch or CSL knockout studies have not shown a clear role for Notch in adult HSCs, gain-of-function experiments show that Notch can promote adult HSC self-renewal in both mice and humans (Karau et al., 2000; Stier et al., 2002; Varnum-Finney et al., 1998, 2000). This effect is dependent on the presence of specific cytokines including SCF, IL-6, IL-11, and Flt3L.
(Varnum-Finney et al., 2003). Many of these effects are replicated in HSCs of mice expressing a HES-1 transgene (Kunisato et al., 2003), suggesting that HES-1 may mediate part of this activity.

If Notch functions in adult HSC homeostasis, which cells in the BM activate signaling? BM stromal cells express Notch ligands and could fulfill this function. Another possibility is osteoblasts, which are closely associated with HSCs and support the growth of early hematopoietic progenitors in vitro (Taichman et al., 1996). Now, Scadden’s group shows that osteoblasts expressing activated Parathyroid Hormone/PTH-related protein (PTH/PTHrP) receptors coexpress Jagged1 while increasing HSC numbers both in vivo and in long-term culture initiating cell assays (LTC-IC) that measure HSC function (Calvi et al., 2003). In the presence of γ-secretase inhibitors, the number of LTC-ICs is reduced to baseline levels (but not zero), suggesting that Notch signaling may influence adult HSCs in specific situations (such as when PTH/PTHrP signals). Although these observations do not confirm a physiologic role for Notch in HSC homeostasis, they open the possibility of using PTH/PTHrP and Notch signaling in therapeutic settings where HSC expansion and engraftment are required, such as bone marrow transplantation.

Besides Notch, the Sonic hedgehog and Wnt pathways, as well as members of the Homeobox gene family, have been implicated in adult HSC expansion and self-renewal (Antonchuk et al., 2002; Bhardwaj et al., 2001; Reya et al., 2003). Deciphering the interactions between these pathways will be critical for understanding the regulation of the HSC pool in vivo. Particularly relevant are studies showing increased Notch1 and HoxB4 expression following Wnt pathway activation in HSCs, a hint at a hierarchy between these pathways (Reya et al., 2003).

### Notch and T Cell Development

The best-established function of Notch during lymphoid development is its critical role in the T/B lymphoid cell fate decision (Figure 2). Results from both gain- and loss-of-function experiments in mice show that Notch1 signaling is required for the earliest steps of T cell commitment from a progenitor that is capable of forming both T and B cells. Loss-of-function experiments result in a hypoplastic thymus, lacking T cells and containing an excess of B cells, whereas gain-of-function experiments lead to thymic-independent development of immature T cells and loss of B cells. The function of Notch in the T/B decision is Notch1 specific and CSL dependent (Han et al., 2002). It is not clear whether Notch1 specificity results from unique downstream signals or expression of this receptor in the appropriate progenitor cell. In support of the latter, constitutive expression of ICN2-4 drives T cell commitment even in the absence of Notch1 signals (I.M. and W.S.P., unpublished data). Nevertheless, the distinct effects of Notch1 gain- and loss-of-function approaches on T cell development provide a readout to determine the activity of several Notch modifiers. These studies show that constitutive expression of Fringe (Koch et al., 2001), Deltex (Izon et al., 2002) and Nrarp (Yun and Bevan, 2003) block Notch1 signals and T cell development. It should be noted that

evidence for the role of Notch in the T/B fate choice is derived from murine studies. Although Notch1 is likely required for T cell commitment in other species (Jaleco et al., 2001), whether this always derives from a T/B progenitor awaits additional studies.

On the basis of these results, it was postulated that common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs) colonizing the thymus are primed for T cell differentiation after receiving a signal through the Notch1 receptor, and differentiate by default into the B cell pathway if they fail to receive such a signal. However, it has not yet been demonstrated that CLPs, defined as Lin⁻IL7Rα⁺Sca-1lo c-kitlo (Kondo et al., 1997) or Lin⁻IL7Rα⁺AA4.1⁺Sca-1lo (Miller et al., 2002), are the physiological progenitors receiving a Notch signal upon thymus colonization. An alternative to CLPs as physiologic T cell progenitors is a population termed early T lineage progenitors (ETPs) that exist within Lin⁻c-kit⁺CD25⁻ thymocytes (Allman et al., 2003). ETPs have a much greater ability to produce T cells than CLPs, and are functionally most closely related to a subset of pluripotent bone marrow progenitors termed Lin⁻Sca-1⁺c-kit⁺ (LSK) rather than to CLPs (Allman et al., 2003). Thus, physiological T cell development may be CLP independent. Clearly, it is important to characterize Notch expression and signaling within the different lymphoid progenitors. In addition, prethymic Notch-mediated T lymphoid commitment warrants study, since such specification occurs in murine fetal liver (Katsura, 2002) and hematopoietic spleen colonies of bone marrow chimeras (Lancrin et al., 2002). The essential role of Notch1 in the generation of thymus-independent intestinal intraepithelial lymphocytes (Wilson et al., 2000) indicates that some extrathymic niches provide the proper signaling environment for Notch-mediated T lymphoid commitment in vivo.

The identity of the relevant Notch ligands in the thymus and their cellular localization remain important questions. Both Jagged and Delta-like family members are expressed on thymic epithelial cells (see Table 1), and may be expressed on thymocytes themselves (Anderson et al., 2001; Felli et al., 1999; Kaneta et al., 2000). Notch ligands are also found on thymic dendritic cells; however, these cells are unlikely to deliver early signals during T cell development (Anderson et al., 2001; Yamaguchi et al., 2002). Data from Petrie’s group indicate that blood-borne progenitors enter the thymus in the perimedullary region of the thymic cortex (Lind et al., 2001), where they then reside for a significant amount of time before differentiating and migrating toward outer regions of the thymic cortex (Porritt et al., 2003). Therefore, it is likely that Notch ligands important for the T versus B lineage specification are expressed in this region.

Recent data show that the Notch ligand DLL-1 has the capacity to induce hematopoietic progenitors to adopt a T cell fate in vitro when expressed in bone marrow stromal cell lines (Jaleco et al., 2001; Schmitt and Zuniga-Pflucker, 2002), while Jagged1 is unable to do so in at least one experimental system (Jaleco et al., 2001). These data corroborate other studies demonstrating T cell commitment and differentiation in culture upon expression of constitutively active forms of Notch (De Smedt et al., 2002; Hozumi et al., 2003). These in vitro studies are complemented by in vivo experiments where

combination), with more precursors passively adopting the γδ lineage due to less efficient β selection. On the contrary, a recent study showed that overexpression of ICN1 in human thymic progenitors caused an increased ratio of γδ over αβ T cells in hybrid human-mouse fetal thymic organ cultures (Garcia-Peydro et al., 2003). This discrepant result was not resolved by inhibiting Notch signaling in the hybrid FTOC, since γ-secretase inhibitors blocked T cell development without preferential impairment of γδ differentiation, as would have been expected from complementary effects in Notch gain- and loss-of-function systems. Whether the expanded γδ T cells represented physiological γδ commitment remains to be demonstrated, since a large proportion of these cells were CD8⁺ and not DN γδ T cells. Earlier results from Robey’s group showed decreased DN γδ but increased CD8⁺ γδ T cells in the thymi of lck-ICN1 transgenic mice (Washburn et al., 1997). Finally, conditional inactivation of Notch1 driven by the expression of Cre under a proximal lck promoter impaired αβ T cell differentiation while preserving normal numbers of γδ T cells (Wolfer et al., 2002). These results may indicate that Notch1 does not influence γδ lineage choice once the T/B lineage decision has been made, or that definitive γδ commitment occurred prior to a decline in Notch1 protein levels after inactivation of the Notch1 gene in this experimental system.

Other data from the same conditional knockout mice strongly indicate that Notch1 actively modulates the preTCR checkpoint. In the absence of Notch1, CD25bright DN3 cells accumulated, similar to mice with impaired components of the pre-TCR such as pTα⁻/⁻, TCRβ⁻/⁻, or RAG-1⁻/⁻ mice. There was also an abnormal DN4 population that did not express a cytoplasmic TCRβ chain and had thus aberrantly survived β selection. Although VDJ recombination was impaired in the absence of Notch1, pTα expression seemed intact, a surprising result since pTα is likely to be a direct Notch transcriptional target (Reizis and Leder, 2002). These data, however, do not rule out an essential role for Notch1 in the initial opening of the pTα locus, before inactivation of the Notch1 gene in lck-Cre x Notch1lox/lox mice, while other proteins would be required at later time points to maintain its expression. Control of vestigial expression in *Drosophila* wing development is an example of such a regulatory mechanism (Kim et al., 1996). Overall, the complex phenotype of lck-Cre x Notch1lox/lox mice suggests that Notch1 contributes to both VDJ recombination at the TCRβ locus and thus to the proper expression of a preTCR, as well as to the physical elimination of cells which fail β selection.

Another controversial area is the function of Notch in the CD4 versus CD8 lineage decision. The mechanisms underlying this decision are complex (reviewed by Singer, 2002). Gain-of-function experiments have suggested that Notch activation increases the ratio of CD8⁺ over CD4⁺ SP cells (Robey et al., 1996). In contrast, Wolfer and collaborators have not observed any deviation from the normal CD4:CD8 ratio in a carefully controlled study of mice with a conditional inactivation of Notch1 at the DN3 stage, using a CD4-Cre transgenic mouse strain (Wolfer et al., 2001). These results indicate either that the findings of gain-of-function experiments are nonphysiological or that other Notch family members besides Notch1 can influence the CD4 versus CD8 lineage decision. Mice capable of conditional inactivation of the CSL gene (Han et al., 2002) should be very interesting to study in this regard, since elimination of CSL blocks signaling through all four Notch family members. Inactivation of CSL at the DN3 stage with a similar strategy as described by Wolfer et al. should provide important evidence to resolve the existing controversy.

Even if the core components of the Notch pathway are relatively stereotyped, downstream targets differ markedly in various cell types and tissues. Surprisingly little is known about the genes that are activated upon Notch1 stimulation during the T/B lineage decision. This contrasts markedly with the wealth of information available on the transcription factors required to initiate and maintain B lineage commitment (Schebesta et al., 2002). One of the reasons for this knowledge gap is related to the technical difficulties in accessing the relevant rare population of thymic progenitors, in comparison to early B cell precursors. Among potential downstream targets, the basic-helix-loop-helix transcription factors HES-1 and HES-5 are Notch-regulated in many organs. Analysis of HES-1 knockout mice revealed abnormalities in thymic development, although the findings do not phenocopy the Notch1 knockout phenotype (Kaneta et al., 2000; Tomita et al., 1999). Indeed, the differentiation block could be overridden by injecting more progenitors with subsequent normal thymocyte development (Kaneta et al., 2000). These findings are consistent with a role for HES-1 in the proliferation of early thymic progenitors, but indicate that HES-1 itself does not recapitulate Notch1 signaling during the T/B lineage decision. Similar data have not been reported for HES-5 or other HES family members. CD25 and pTα may also be direct Notch transcriptional targets; however, their expression does not appear to be coincident with the time of the T/B cell fate choice.

As in other lineage decisions, Notch-induced T cell commitment is likely to be accompanied by inhibition of alternative cell fates. For example, Notch1 signaling inhibits E2A signaling, an activity that may be important for the loss of B cell potential (Izon et al., 2002; Ordentlich et al., 1998). An interesting reciprocal interaction was found in early B cell progenitors, where Pax5 directly inhibited Notch1 transcription in mice in which the Pax5 gene was knocked into the Ikaros locus and expressed widely during hematopoietic development (Souabni et al., 2002). Although inhibition of T cell development was observed in the thymi of these mice, intrathymic B cell development was not described. Furthermore, extrathymic T cell development was not observed in Pax5⁻/⁻ mice, a finding that might have resulted from the loss of Pax5-mediated Notch inhibition. Nevertheless, these findings illustrate how transcription factors promote differentiation to one lineage, while inhibiting alternative cell fates.

Altogether, much remains to be learned about Notch-regulated transcriptional control of T cell commitment, and how this control is connected to the other pathways known to regulate early T cell differentiation. For example, GATA-3 and Wnt are key players in the regulatory network of early T cell development (Rothenberg, 2002; Ting et al., 1996; van de Wetering et al., 2002), and links to the Notch pathway would be interesting to explore.

Notch receptors are present in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> peripheral T cells (Table 1), and expression of all four receptors is upregulated following T cell activation (Adler et al., 2003; Palaga et al., 2003). After antigenic stimulation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, Notch1 activation occurred, as demonstrated by reagents detecting the cleaved (activated) protein (Adler et al., 2003). Furthermore, Notch ligand exposure induces HES-1 and Deltex1 expression (Palaga et al., 2003; Yvon et al., 2003). In addition, the relative abundance of Notch4 mRNA, which is present at very low levels during T cell development, is markedly increased following T cell activation; however, it remains to be determined if Notch4 protein expression and activity are similarly increased. Together, these reports suggest a potential role for Notch in T cell immune responses.

This potential role was confirmed by two recent studies showing that Notch signaling enhanced T cell activation (Adler et al., 2003; Palaga et al., 2003). In loss-of-function experiments using γ-secretase inhibitors, T cell proliferation and cytokine production (IL-2 and IFNγ) were inhibited (Adler et al., 2003; Palaga et al., 2003). Palaga et al. also investigated T cell activation in Notch1 antisense transgenic mice and found diminished IL-2 and IFNγ secretion from transgenic T cells. Since a similar phenotype was not reported in Notch1 conditional knockout mice (see below), it is possible that the Notch1 antisense construct had broader effects. In contrast, constitutive ICN1 expression enhanced CD25 expression in primary CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and their proliferation when exposed to subthreshold levels of peptide or IL-2 (Adler et al., 2003). Together, these data provide the first evidence that Notch signaling has the potential to augment T cell function. The addition of the Notch pathway to the numerous effects of other costimulatory signals might provide a means to either enhance or terminate T cell immune responses. The physiological relevance and mechanisms of this effect await further studies.

In contrast, genetic studies using Notch1 conditional knockout mice have not identified a requirement for Notch1 in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, as peripheral T cell responses were normal in lymphocytes derived from Notch1<sup>lox/lox</sup> x CD4-Cre mice (Radtke et al., 2002). Although these studies suggest that Notch1 alone is not required for peripheral T cell responses, it does not rule out a role for other Notch receptors, a possibility suggested by the increased expression of all four receptors in activated T cells (Adler et al., 2003). In fact, results from Yasutomo’s group (Maekawa et al., 2003) suggest that signaling through Notch3 may be required to generate an optimal Th1 response. Utilizing both gain- and loss-of-function approaches, this group showed that activation of Notch signaling by Dll-1 in nonpolarizing conditions, as well as in Th1 and Th2 polarizing conditions, enhanced γ-interferon and downregulated IL-4 production. Notch signaling may be upstream of T-bet transcription, and retroviral expression of ICN3 but not ICN1 recapitulated the ability of Dll-1 to induce γ-interferon. Although this work requires confirmation in the knockout mice, it suggests a potential role for Notch during cell fate decisions in mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

An additional role for Notch in modulating T cell responses is suggested by several studies showing that

Notch signaling can induce the appearance of regulatory T cells (Hoyne et al., 2000; Yvon et al., 2003). In studies using either murine or human cells, exposure of T cells to APCs engineered to express Jagged1 generated T regulatory cells capable of transferring inhibitory activity to naive cultures (Hoyne et al., 2000; Yvon et al., 2003). Although wild-type APCs express several Notch ligands (Jagged1, Jagged2, Dll-1, and Dll-4; Table 1), their ability to induce T regulatory cells via Notch activation has not been demonstrated. Thus, the physiologic relevance of these studies awaits confirmation. Recently, a novel dendritic cell subset (CD11c<sup>lo</sup> and CD45RB<sup>hi</sup> plasmacytoid DCs) was found to promote the appearance of regulatory T cells (Wakkach et al., 2003). Whether or not this DC population expresses Notch ligands and can induce Notch signaling is unknown.

### Notch and B Cells

Notch2 is the predominant Notch receptor in B cells, with widespread expression throughout B cell development and in peripheral B cell subsets (Kuroda et al., 2003; Saito et al., 2003). Overexpression of ICN in vivo results in profound inhibition of B cell development (Kawamata et al., 2002; Pui et al., 1999). Furthermore, expression of ICN in various chicken, mouse, and human B cell lines results in growth arrest and apoptosis (Mori-mura et al., 2000). Whether Notch plays analogous roles in vivo at physiological levels remains to be explored.

Analysis of CSL and more recently Notch2 conditional knockout mice revealed a critical role for Notch2 in the generation of marginal zone B (MZB) cells (Saito et al., 2003; Tanigaki et al., 2002). The mechanisms through which Notch exerts this important function and the precise cellular intermediates during MZB development are poorly understood. MZB cells are best characterized in mice as a subset of nonrecirculating mature splenic B cells localized in the marginal zone, expressing a distinct immunophenotype (slgM<sup>hi</sup>CD21<sup>hi</sup>CD23<sup>lo</sup>). They exhibit robust proliferation upon LPS stimulation, secrete antibodies early during immune responses, and may function in the immune response to blood-borne pathogens (reviewed in Martin and Kearney, 2002). Although some of these properties are shared with B1 B cells, the influence of Notch on the B1 B cell pool is controversial. No reduction in peritoneal B1 B cells was observed in both CSL and Notch2 conditional knockout mice, while a significant decrease in the peritoneal B1a and to a lesser extent the B1b population was reported recently by Klug’s group in Notch2<sup>+/−</sup> mice (Witt et al., 2003). A potential explanation to resolve this controversy may be that gene inactivation during fetal life is required to see an effect on B1 B cells.

Multiple pathways influence the generation and/or retention of MZB cells. The BCR itself is likely involved, as perturbations in the nature and strength of BCR signals affect recruitment to the MZB compartment (reviewed in Martin and Kearney, 2002). The absolute number of B cells may also be important, as several genetic models with impaired B cell development, such as mice with impaired signaling through the IL-7R or preBCR complex, display a relative increase in MZB cell numbers, possibly due to preferential filling of the MZB compartment (reviewed in Martin and Kearney, 2002). Specific
non-BCR signaling pathways are also important as Aiolos knockout mice, and mice lacking components of the NFκB pathway have a decreased MZB cell pool (Cariappa et al., 2000, 2001). Retention of the cells in the MZ also plays a role, as antibody-mediated blockade of LFA-1 and α4β1 integrins in vivo led to physical release of B cells from the MZ (Lu and Cyster, 2002). If and how Notch2 interacts with these different pathways remains to be determined. Conceptually, Notch could function by modulating other pathways or it could act as a gatekeeper to the MZB cell pool, independently of other signals. Among potential effects of Notch2 activation, BCR signal strength could be modulated, an effect that may parallel the observed effect of Notch on TCR signal strength (Izon et al., 2001). Alternatively, Notch has been shown to interact with the NFκB pathway in several circumstances. Although the mechanisms and the overall result of such interactions are controversial, they may be relevant in MZ precursors (Bash et al., 1999; Wang et al., 2001).

The cellular intermediates during MZB cell differentiation remain poorly characterized. One hypothesis is that MZB cells differentiate from immature splenic transitional B cells as an alternative cell fate to follicular B (FoB) cells. In this sense, the effect of Notch2 may be a classical binary cell fate decision. This hypothesis was supported by findings in conditional CSL knockout mice where the FoB cell pool increased concomitantly to a decrease in the MZB cell compartment, while the opposite was true in mice with targeted inactivation of MINT, a newly described Notch inhibitor (Tanigaki et al., 2002; Kuroda et al., 2002). However, this reciprocal regulation was not reported in Notch2 knockout animals (Saito et al., 2003). Furthermore, independent evidence indicates that the size of the MZB cell pool may be tightly controlled and adjusted in the periphery, perhaps through recruitment and differentiation from other mature B cell subsets (Hao and Rajewsky, 2001; Vinuesa et al., 2003). Recent results identified a population of slgMhiCD21hi-CD23+ splenic B cells that decreased concomitantly with MZB cells in the absence of Notch2 signals (Saito et al., 2003; Witt et al., 2003; Maillard and Pear, submitted). This population may represent a MZB precursor, and its study may provide clues into MZB cell development. A precise understanding of the precursor-product relationships among different B cell subsets is needed to further characterize the role of Notch2 in MZB differentiation.

### Concluding Remarks

Although Notch may not do everything (much to the chagrin of many in the field), it plays several important roles in hematopoietic development that include establishment of embryonic HSCs, T cell commitment, and marginal zone B cell development. Whether it functions in other lineages or other stages of T cell differentiation remains controversial, but new reagents, such as conditional CSL knockout mice, should provide some answers in the near future. The precise mechanisms by which Notch influences these lineage decisions are not known, nor is it clear when Notch may exert its other potential functions. Challenges that remain are identifying the precise ligand:receptor interactions that occur

in vivo, identifying the downstream targets of Notch signaling, and understanding the functions of Notch modifiers. In addition, there are few antibodies that recognize Notch signaling components and improved reagents would lead to advances afforded by image analysis. Although it is not clear if Notch-specific reagents will be clinically useful, the potential use of γ-secretase inhibitors to treat Alzheimer’s disease emphasizes the importance of understanding the effects of Notch signaling in the immune system.
