■ **Abstract** The guidance of axons during the establishment of the nervous system is mediated by a variety of extracellular cues that govern cytoskeletal dynamics in axonal growth cones. A large number of these guidance cues and their cell-surface receptors have now been identified, and the intracellular signaling pathways by which these cues induce cytoskeletal rearrangements are becoming defined. This review summarizes our current understanding of the major families of axon guidance cues and their receptors, with a particular emphasis on receptor signaling mechanisms. We also discuss recent advances in understanding receptor cross talk and how the activities of guidance cues and their receptors are modulated during neural development.  

## INTRODUCTION  

During development of the nervous system, neurons project axons over long distances in order to reach their final targets. Along the way, growth cones located at the leading edges of axons detect and respond to environmental cues that guide them to their appropriate targets (Figure 1A). These guidance cues, both attractants and repellents, include contact-mediated or secreted molecules, acting over short or long distances, respectively. It is clear that many individual guidance cues can function both as repellents and attractants. This guidance cue bifunctionality depends on a variety of factors including the intracellular state of the growth cone, differential expression of receptor complexes, and cross talk between intracellular signaling cascades. Growing axons must sense and respond to a myriad of axon guidance cues, and the mechanisms involved in the integration of information provided by guidance cues are now being unraveled. Here we discuss major families of axon guidance cues and their receptors with a particular focus on recent advances in understanding the intracellular signals generated at the growth cone

# GROWTH CONE MACHINERY AND DYNAMICS

At the leading edge of a growing axon is the growth cone, a structure capable of sensing and rapidly responding to its environment. The growth cone is composed of lamellipodia, which contain cross-linked networks of actin filaments, and filopodia, tensile structures composed of bundled F-actin that probe the extracellular environment (Figure 1B). This peripheral actin network is associated in the proximal portion of the growth cone with microtubules located in the distal region of the axon shaft and contributes to the assembly and translocation of microtubules into more proximal regions of the growth cone (Mallavarapu & Mitchison 1999, Mitchison & Kirschner 1988, Suter & Forscher 2000). Regulation of actin polymerization at the leading edge of filopodia and lamellipodia, of actin depolymerization in proximal regions of the growth cone, and of the rate of F-actin retrograde flow within both filopodia and lamellipodia together control growth cone advancement and retraction. It is no surprise that, within the growth cone, attractive guidance cues can promote actin polymerization and prevent retrograde actin flow, while in contrast repulsive guidance cues can have reciprocal effects on these processes.

## Rho GTPases and Growth Cone Actin Dynamics

How do axon guidance cues regulate cytoskeletal dynamics within the growth cone? There is ample evidence that axon guidance cue signaling involves the action of proteins belonging to the Rho family of small GTP-binding proteins, key regulators of actin cytoskeletal dynamics. Indeed, Rho family GTPases orchestrate actin filament assembly and disassembly through the control of actin polymerization, branching, and depolymerization. Moreover, Rho family members direct actin-myosin-dependent contractility, controlling the retrograde flow of F-actin within the growth cone. Here we introduce Rho family GTPases and provide an

overview of some of their key effectors that control cytoskeletal rearrangements (reviewed in Dickson 2001, Hall 1998, Luo 2000, Luo 2002).

The best studied Rho GTPases, Cdc42, Rac, and RhoA, have been implicated in the control of lamellipodial and filopodial dynamics in fibroblasts and, more recently, in neuronal growth cones. Like all small GTP-binding proteins, Rho GTPases cycle between active and inactive states through the binding of guanine nucleotides. In their GTP-bound states, Rho GTPases recruit effector proteins to the membrane and are thus considered active. Hydrolysis of GTP to GDP by their intrinsic GTPase activity disrupts GTPase binding to effectors and thereby inactivates these GTPases. The activity of Rho GTPases is controlled by the opposing actions of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) (Figure 2). GEFs facilitate the exchange of GDP to GTP, thereby turning on Rho GTPase signaling, whereas GAPs turn off Rho GTPase signaling by activating their endogenous GTPase activities. Axon guidance receptors can be directly or indirectly coupled to GEFs and GAPs, affording these receptors direct control over Rho GTPases. The large number of GEFs and GAPs, many of which are expressed uniquely both temporally and spatially in the nervous system,

pathways activated by various guidance cues.

# Targets of Rho GTPases in Actin Polymerization

How do Rho GTPases regulate actin polymerization at the leading edges of filopodia and lamellipodia? Recent studies that have identified critical effectors of Rho GTPases provide answers to this question. One such effector is N-WASP, a key regulator of the Arp2/3 complex. The Arp2/3 complex, which is composed of seven highly conserved proteins, controls actin filament nucleation and branching (Figure 2) (Higgs & Pollard 2001). The branch-initiation activity of the Arp2/3 complex is induced by its interaction with nucleation-promoting factors of the WASP/SCAR family of proteins, including N-WASP (Rohatgi et al. 1999). Indeed, the active form of Cdc42 binds directly to N-WASP. This results in N-WASP interaction with, and activation of, the Arp2/3 complex, thus promoting actin nucleation (Figure 2). Another WASP family member, SCAR/WAVE, also promotes Arp2/3 activity and appears to mediate Rac-dependent actin branching, at least in fibroblasts (Machesky et al. 1999). However, the roles of Cdc42 and Rac in regulating N-WASP and SCAR/WAVE in neuronal growth cones remain to be elucidated.

In addition to controlling nucleation of actin filament branches, guidance cues can influence actin assembly at the distal, barbed (plus), ends of actin filaments. Polymerization of actin is regulated by the monomeric actin-binding protein profilin, which directs the addition of actin subunits to the plus end of actin filaments (Suetsugu et al. 1998). Profilin-binding proteins of the VASP/Ena family, characterized in both vertebrates and invertebrates, are key modulators of actin polymerization (Figure 2). Ena positively regulates actin polymerization by associating with the barbed end of actin filaments, thereby preventing the binding of capping proteins (Bear et al. 2002). Consistent with the idea that these Profilin-binding proteins control growth cone motility in vivo, it has been observed that flies, worms, and mice lacking Ena family members exhibit axon growth and guidance defects (Lanier et al. 1999, Wills et al. 1999, Yu et al. 2002). Although VASP/Ena can decrease lamellipodial motility and stability in fibroblasts and appear to play a similar role in neurons (Bashaw et al. 2000, Bear et al. 2000), how Rho GTPases or other guidance cue signaling intermediates modulate the activities of Ena and Profilin during growth cone navigation is presently unknown.

# Targets of Rho GTPases in Actin Depolymerization

Rho GTPases also regulate the disassembly of the minus end of actin filaments, a process controlled by actin-binding proteins including the F-actin filament-severing protein cofilin (Bamburg 1999, Carlier et al. 1999). p21-activated kinase (PAK) and Rho kinase (ROCK) link Rho GTPases to LIM kinase (LIMK),

negative regulator of cofilin activity (Figure 2). Thus, recruitment and activation of PAK by GTP-bound Rac or Cdc42, and of ROCK by GTP-bound Rho, result in phosphorylation of LIMK and activation of its protein kinase activity (Arber et al. 1998, Yang et al. 1998). LIMK, in turn, directly phosphorylates and inactivates cofilin, thereby attenuating actin filament disassembly. In addition to Rho GTPase regulation of cofilin activity through the activities of various kinases, cofilin activity is reciprocally controlled by the phosphoserine/threonine phosphatase Slingshot, which dephosphorylates and activates cofilin, thereby promoting F-actin depolymerization (Niwa et al. 2002).

## Targets of Rho GTPases in Myosin Activity

In addition to controlling actin assembly and disassembly, Rho GTPases control the retrograde flow of F-actin by regulating the activity of nonmuscle myosin and actin-myosin-mediated contractility (Figure 2). This is accomplished through protein kinase cascades that culminate in the phosphorylation of nonmuscle myosin by either ROCK or myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) (Amano et al. 1996). Phosphorylation of myosin, which in turn facilitates its actin-dependent ATPase activity, promotes actin/myosin-dependent contractility and, therefore, retrograde flow of F-actin (Kamm & Stull 1985). In addition, ROCK prevents dephosphorylation and inactivation of myosin by phosphorylating and inhibiting myosin light chain phosphatase (Kimura et al. 1996). In contrast, activation of Rac or Cdc42 results in dephosphorylation of myosin and inactivation of actin/myosin-dependent contractility. Rac and Cdc42 exert this effect through PAK-mediated phosphorylation and inactivation of MLCK (Sanders et al. 1999). Thus, several major effector pathways activated by Rho family GTPases converge onto protein kinases and phosphatases, which in turn regulate myosin phosphorylation and activity, the key determinant of F-actin retrograde flow.

In summary, guidance cues control at least five processes that affect growth cone dynamics and motility: actin polymerization, branching, depolymerization, activity of nonmuscle myosin, and retrograde flow of F-actin. Below, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of how specific families of guidance cues and their receptors regulate key signaling intermediates, including Rho family GTPases, to control these processes in the growth cone.

## NETRINS

The netrins are a small family of phylogenetically conserved secreted proteins with amino acid sequence similarity to proteins of the laminin family. Extensive characterization of netrin function in *C. elegans*, *Drosophila*, and vertebrates has revealed the ability of netrins to function as both neuronal chemoattractants and repellents (reviewed in Chisholm & Tessier-Lavigne 1999). An example of netrin bifunctionality is observed in vertebrates, where netrin-1 functions in vitro and in vivo to attract spinal cord commissural neuron axons to the floor plate and in vitro
to repel trochlear motor axons (Colamarino & Tessier-Lavigne 1995; Serafini et al. 1996, 1994). These opposing neuronal guidance responses to netrins may depend in part upon activation of different netrin receptor complexes, and they suggest that differential activation of intracellular signaling cascades defines netrin function.

# Receptor Complexes

Members of the DCC family of netrin receptors, which include *C. elegans* UNC-40, *Drosophila* Frazzled, and vertebrate DCC and Neogenin, have been shown to mediate netrin attraction (Chan et al. 1996, Keino-Masu et al. 1996, Kolodziej et al. 1996). DCC proteins have large extracellular domains composed of multiple immunoglobulin (Ig) repeats, fibronectin type III (FNIII) repeats, and large cytoplasmic domains with three conserved motifs (P1, P2, and P3). Ligand-gated multimerization of DCC proteins through their P3 regions is required for netrin-induced attraction events (Figure 3) (Stein & Tessier-Lavigne 2001). Studies of UNC-6-mediated repulsion in *C. elegans* show that some, but not all, repulsive events require both the DCC family member UNC-40 and the UNC-5 protein, and they suggest that different regions of UNC-6 are responsible for functional associations with these two receptors (Chan et al. 1996, Lim & Wadsworth 2002, Merz et al. 2001, Wadsworth et al. 1996).

The UNC-5 receptor family includes *C. elegans* UNC-5, *Drosophila* Dunc5, and the vertebrate proteins UNC5H1, UNC5H2, and UNC5H3 (Ackerman et al. 1997, Keleman et al. 2002, Leonardo et al. 1997, Leung-Hagesteijn et al. 1992). UNC5 proteins are also Ig super family members; however, they are structurally quite distinct from DCC proteins (Figure 3). Analysis of netrin-mediated repulsive steering in vertebrate neurons using the single neuron growth cone steering assay developed by Poo and colleagues demonstrates a requirement for direct association between the DCC and UNC-5 cytoplasmic domains for this repulsive guidance event (Hong et al. 1999). This association is ligand-dependent and is required for netrin-mediated long-range repulsion. It is interesting that the UNC-5 extracellular domain is dispensable for DCC/UNC-5-mediated repulsion of Xenopus spinal neurons; expression of a membrane-associated UNC-5 cytoplasmic domain in DCC-expressing Xenopus spinal neurons is sufficient for netrin-induced repulsion (Hong et al. 1999). These and other observations suggest that binding of netrin to DCC and/or UNC-5 induces conformational changes in these receptors, allowing their cytoplasmic domains to interact and initiate downstream signaling events. In *Drosophila*, Dunc5 appears to mediate short-range netrin repulsion independently of DCC (Keleman & Dickson 2001). These observations, taken together, suggest that all combinations of netrin receptors may constitute netrin holoreceptors and are important for netrin guidance functions.

Because additional coreceptors may participate in netrin signaling, the current debate centering around the possibility that the adenosine A2b receptor may fulfill such a function is of great interest. Certain pharmacological experiments suggest that the A2b receptor is required for netrin-1-promoted outgrowth of dorsal

Figure 3 Netrin receptor signaling. The netrins are secreted proteins that bind to transmembrane proteins of the DCC family. The composition of netrin receptor complexes dictates the growth cone response to netrin. Binding of netrin to DCC homodimers (left) induces association of DCC cytoplasmic domains, which leads to growth cone attraction. This attraction signal requires elevated levels of cAMP and may involve activation of the Rho GTPases Cdc42 and Rac-1. In contrast, binding of netrin to UNC-5-DCC heterodimers (right) leads to growth cone repulsion.

spinal cord neurons and for netrin-1-induced growth cone attraction of stage 24 Xenopus retinal ganglion cells (Corset et al. 2000, Shewan et al. 2002). Some of these results, however, are directly challenged by observations, including both pharmacological data suggesting that A2b receptor activation is not required for netrin attraction of commissural axons and the finding that the A2b receptor is not expressed on commissural axons (Stein et al. 2001). Resolution of this issue has important implications with respect to the composition of netrin holoreceptors and the regulation of downstream signaling events.

# Signaling Downstream of Netrin Receptors

Recent evidence sheds light on mechanisms by which netrin-DCC signaling can control the growth cone cytoskeleton. Expression of DCC in HEK 293T cells, or a neuroblastoma cell line, allows for netrin-induced increases in filopodial number and cell-surface area effects, which are blocked by dominant-negative forms of Cdc42 and Rac1, respectively (Shekarabi & Kennedy 2002). Netrin-1 can activate Rac1 and Cdc42 in DCC-expressing cells and can also induce Cdc42-dependent actin reorganization in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts expressing DCC (Shekarabi & Kennedy 2002, Li et al. 2002b). The exact mechanism by which netrin modulates the activity of Rho GTPases is unknown but may involve the adapter protein Nck, which associates with DCC in commissural neurons (Li et al. 2002a). Moreover, a Nck protein lacking a functional SH2 domain acts in a dominant-negative fashion to prevent netrin-induced neurite extension in neuroblastoma cells and Rac1 activation in Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts (Li et al. 2002a). Thus, Nck may couple DCC signals to Rho GTPases. How might this occur? The Nck *Drosophila* homologue Dreadlocks (Dock) (Garrity et al. 1996) genetically interacts with a GEF called Trio and is required for photoreceptor and motor axon pathfinding (Bateman et al. 2000, Newsome et al. 2000). Furthermore, Trio genetically interacts with Rac in *Drosophila*, and the GEF1 domain of Trio can stimulate guanine nucleotide release from Rac1 and Rac2 in vitro (Newsome et al. 2000). In addition, Nck-Dock interactions are likely to control cytoskeletal dynamics by recruiting PAK to the plasma membrane upon cell-surface receptor engagement (Bokoch et al. 1996, Galisteo et al. 1996, Hing et al. 1999). It will be interesting to see whether DCC-Nck interactions directly modulate the activity of Rho GTPases through regulation of Rho GEFs.

How UNC-5 signals netrin-mediated repulsion is not known. Recently, the *C. elegans* multidomain cytoplasmic protein MAX-1 has been shown to be required for UNC-5-dependent netrin repulsive guidance (Huang et al. 2002). MAX-1 proteins in both invertebrates and vertebrates have pleckstrin homology (PH) domains, a myosin tail homology 4 (MyTH4) domain, and a Band4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin (FERM) domain. These domains suggest that MAX-1 is capable of membrane localization and of participating in phosphatidylinositol phospholipid signaling. MAX-1 is localized to punctate cytosolic structures in *C. elegans* neurons and in vertebrate tissue culture cells. In the latter, MAX-1 and UNC-5 show

colocalization. It remains to be determined how the genetic interactions observed between *max-1* and *unc-5* reflect underlying molecular signaling by UNC-5 in response to UNC-6. Genetic screens in *C. elegans* have resulted in the isolation of several signaling components downstream of UNC-5 (Colavita & Culotti 1998), including a suppressor of UNC-5-mediated repulsion, *unc-34*, which is a *C. elegans* Ena homologue (Yu et al. 2002). UNC-5 signaling may also be regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Netrin can stimulate UNC-5 and UNC-5H3/RCM tyrosine phosphorylation in *C. elegans* and vertebrates, respectively (Tong et al. 2001). Moreover, netrin-induced phosphorylation of UNC-5H3/RCM in HEK 293T cells leads to its association with the tyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 (Tong et al. 2001). Future work will determine whether tyrosine phosphorylation of UNC-5 and the association of UNC-5 with Shp-2 are required in vivo for netrin-induced repulsion.

# Modulation of Netrin Signaling

It is now clear that the action of most guidance cues is subject to modulation at several levels. This degree of regulation is essential given the overall limited number of guidance cues that must orchestrate the generation of complex neural connectivity during development and which presumably play equally important and diverse roles in regulating synaptic plasticity in the adult nervous system. One potential mechanism for modulating netrin signaling involves regulation of levels of cyclic nucleotides within growth cones. Using the growth cone turning assay, the striking observation was made that decreased cAMP levels convert DCC-mediated netrin attraction into repulsion, whereas increased cAMP levels resulted in attraction (Ming et al. 1997; reviewed in Song & Poo 1999). Multiple in vitro studies demonstrate that protein kinase A (PKA) activation modulates netrin signaling and that treatments that affect PKA activity, including Ca<sup>++</sup> influx associated with electrical activity, can modulate netrin guidance (Ming et al. 2001, 1997). In this context, the possibility that netrin-1 may directly influence cAMP production through its association with both DCC and the adenosine A2b receptor is especially interesting. Netrin-1 induces an increase in cAMP levels in HEK 293 cells transfected with the A2b receptor (Corset et al. 2000), which suggests that this receptor might directly link netrin signaling to elevation of cAMP levels. While the role of A2b receptor in netrin-mediated attraction is controversial, it is nonetheless clear that regulation of cyclic nucleotide levels could be a versatile mechanism by which various environmental cues might modulate netrin-mediated responses. In addition, Xenopus retinoganglial cells grown on a laminin substrate show decreased cAMP levels in their growth cones and are repelled by netrin-1, which suggests that multiple extracellular factors have the capacity to alter intracellular signaling responses to netrin through the modulation of cyclic nucleotide levels (Hopker et al. 1999). It remains a future goal to demonstrate in vivo that regulation of endogenous cAMP levels is a key component of the netrin signaling cascade.

Localized protein synthesis within the neuronal growth cone, remarkably, is required for netrin-1-induced attraction and repulsion (Campbell & Holt 2001). This provides an intriguing way to think about modulation of guidance cue activity through mechanisms such as the regulation by protein synthesis of netrin receptors and their intracellular signaling components. Netrin-1 stimulates phosphorylation of the translation initiation factor eIF4E, protein translation, and protein degradation in growth cones that have been separated from their cell bodies; inhibitors of these processes block netrin-mediated steering. Several translation initiation factors, such as eIF4E, are regulated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. Therefore, the observation that extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)-1/2 is recruited to DCC, activated following netrin-1 stimulation of transfected cells and spinal commissural neurons, and required for netrin-mediated attraction supports the idea that regulation of protein translation by MAPK signaling is crucial for growth cone steering (Forcet et al. 2002). These results suggest an acute requirement for protein synthesis in netrin-mediated guidance. An interesting alternative, however, is offered by observations that the cycle of desensitization and resensitization of growth cones over long time periods to netrin-1 gradients in the growth cone turning assay requires protein synthesis for the resensitization phase of this process (Ming et al. 2001). Therefore, a sustained response to netrin-1 may require both the initial response to this guidance cue and subsequent replenishment of internalized signaling complexes to the growth cone through new protein synthesis.

Posttranslational modification of netrin receptors themselves on the growth cone surface may also regulate netrin activity. Metalloproteases regulate cell-surface expression of DCC in vitro and can potentiate netrin attraction, providing an additional mode of DCC regulation (Galko & Tessier-Lavigne 2000). In addition, DCC itself can serve to sequester netrin in the absence of its function as a netrin signaling receptor and, in this manner, modulate netrin by regulating its presentation to extending axons (Hiramoto et al. 2000). Finally, netrin attraction can be silenced by the action of an unrelated guidance cue and its receptor, Slit and roundabout (Robo) respectively, on DCC; we consider this modulation of netrin signaling following our discussion of Slits and their receptors. Therefore, multiple mechanisms are at play that provide neuronal growth cones with the ability to refine their responses to netrins at multiple points during the establishment of axonal trajectories.

## SLITS

Members of the Slit family of axon guidance molecules control a wide range of physiological processes during neural development including axon pathfinding (Bagri et al. 2002, Battye et al. 1999, Fricke et al. 2001, Kidd et al. 1999, Plump et al. 2002), axonal and dendritic branching (Wang et al. 1999, Whitford et al. 2002), and neuronal cell migration (Hu 1999, Kramer et al. 2001, Wu et al. 2001, Wu et al. 1999, Zhu et al. 1999). Slit proteins are structurally conserved across species and contain several protein motifs [leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), EFG repeats,

and a Laminin G domain] common to ECM and extracellular signaling proteins (Figure 4) (Rothberg et al. 1990). Slits have been most extensively characterized with respect to their role in orchestrating axonal navigation at the CNS midline. The *Drosophila* Slit protein is strongly expressed in specialized CNS midline glial cells, which provides a repulsive cue that prevents ipsilaterally projecting neurons from crossing the midline and contralaterally projecting neurons from recrossing (Kidd et al. 1999, Rajagopalan et al. 2000b, Simpson et al. 2000). In addition, Slit has been implicated in governing the lateral position of different longitudinal axon tracts that run rostrocaudally within the *Drosophila* CNS, although the role of Slit as a long-range guidance cue in this capacity remains to be directly demonstrated. It is interesting that Slit also functions in *Drosophila* to position migrating mesodermal cells, acting first as a repellent to govern cell positioning with respect to the CNS midline and later as an attractant to promote correct muscle insertion in the body wall (Kramer et al. 2001).

Three vertebrate Slits have been identified to date with overlapping, but distinct, patterns of expression throughout development and in adulthood (Holmes et al. 1998, Itoh et al. 1998, Marillat et al. 2002, Piper et al. 2000, Yuan et al. 1999). The recent characterization of *Slit* mutant mice suggests a certain degree of redundancy in Slit-1 and Slit-2 function during neural development. Although analysis of the retinal ganglion cell projections in *Slit-1* or *Slit-2* mutant mice did not reveal any defects, these projections are severely disorganized in double mutant mice (Plump et al. 2002). These results show that, unlike in *Drosophila* where Slit repels contralaterally projecting neurons only after they cross the CNS midline, vertebrate Slit-1 and Slit-2 appear to function as repellents for retinal ganglion axons. This provides “surround” repulsion that directs these axons along their appropriate paths prior to, and after passage through, the optic chiasm. Similar results were obtained for various other CNS tracts including the corpus callosum, thalamocortical projections, and the lateral olfactory tract (Bagri et al. 2002, Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al. 2002). In vitro analyses establish that vertebrate Slit-2 functions as an axonal repellent but that the N-terminal Slit cleavage product acts as a branch-promoting factor for dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensory neurons (Wang et al. 1999). It is interesting that both of these functions appear to be mediated by interactions with Robo receptors (Brose et al. 1999, Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al. 2001).

Figure 4 Slit/Robo signaling events. Slit family repulsive guidance cues are ligands for members of the Robo family of transmembrane proteins. Activation of Robo by Slit recruits srGAPs (slit-robo GAPs) to the receptor complex and leads to the inactivation of Cdc42. The profilin-binding protein Ena has also been implicated as an effector of Slit/Robo-induced signals. Downregulation of Robo signaling may be achieved through phosphorylation of its CC1 motif by the Abelson tyrosine kinase (Abl). In addition, surface expression of *Drosophila* Robo is regulated through its association with Commissureless (Comm). Comm may downregulate Robo expression by targeting Robo protein to the late endocytic pathway.

Receptor Complexes

The Robo family of transmembrane proteins includes members that function as receptors for Slits in *Drosophila*, *C. elegans*, mammals, and possibly zebrafish (Figure 4) (Brose et al. 1999, Fricke et al. 2001, Kidd et al. 1998, Zallen et al. 1998). Robo proteins are phylogenetically conserved Ig super family members with large extracellular domains composed of Ig and FNIII repeats and large cytoplasmic domains lacking any catalytically active domains. Robo intracellular domains, composed of conserved CC motifs, are required for Slit-mediated chemorepulsion and also for silencing of netrin-mediated chemoattraction (Bashaw & Goodman 1999, Stein & Tessier-Lavigne 2001). Functional analysis of Robo mutants harboring deletions in various CC motifs reveals their importance in Robo-mediated Slit effects (Bashaw et al. 2000). While a certain degree of redundancy exists in the function of the different Robo CC motifs, it is clear that different CC domains mediate distinct aspects of Robo signaling. For example, the CC1 motif of Robo-1 is essential for Robo-mediated silencing of netrin signaling but is dispensable for Robo-mediated repulsion of stage 28 Xenopus spinal neurons (Stein & Tessier-Lavigne 2001). In *Drosophila* there are three Robo receptors, and these receptors may have different sensitivities to the repulsive effects of midline-derived Slit (Rajagopalan et al. 2000a, Simpson et al. 2000). The neuronal expression patterns of these Robo receptors define a code that establishes the stereotypic medial to lateral distribution of longitudinal axon bundles. Though Robo proteins are the best characterized Slit receptors, recent genetic data in *C. elegans* suggest that Unc40/DCC participates in SLT-SAX3/Robo signaling, responding to Slit in a netrin-independent manner (Yu et al. 2002). In combination with a biochemical demonstration that the cytoplasmic domains of both Unc40 and SAX-3 bind to each other, these data provide yet another example of heteromultimeric receptor complexes that may enable the growth cone to respond to local cues through alteration of receptor complex composition.

Signaling Downstream of Slit Receptors

Experiments in *Drosophila* suggest that the Abelson (Abl) tyrosine kinase and one of its substrates, Ena, are involved in the Robo signaling cascade (Bashaw et al. 2000). Whereas association of Ena with the Robo CC1 and CC2 motifs positively regulates Robo signaling, phosphorylation of the CC3 motif by Abl attenuates Robo activity. Similar results were obtained in *C. elegans* where UNC-34/Ena is required for SLT(Slit)/SAX-3(Robo) repulsive guidance (Yu et al. 2002). As discussed above, Ena may enhance F-actin polymerization at the leading edge of the growth cone. However, in combination with results in vertebrate fibroblasts showing that Ena can function to reduce cell motility (Bear et al. 2002), these results in flies and *C. elegans* underscore the need to use caution when generalizing functions initially ascribed to cytoskeletal regulators in fibroblasts to neuronal growth cones. Precisely how Ena functions to signal Slit repulsion, therefore, remains to be determined.

In addition to modulation of Ena function, Robo signaling may confer cytoskeletal rearrangements through the regulation of small Rho GTPases (Wong et al. 2001). Slit-2 can downregulate Cdc42 activity in HEK 293T cells, and constitutively activated Cdc42 blocks the repellent activity of Slit-2 on SV2a neuronal migration in vitro. The Robo receptor appears to regulate Rho GTPase activity through a ligand-dependent association with members of a novel family of GAPs called srGAPs (slit-robo GAPs). SrGAPs associate with the Robo CC3 motif through their SH3 domains (Wong et al. 2001). Dominant-negative srGAP prevents both Slit-mediated downregulation of Cdc42 activity in HEK 293T cells and Slit-induced repulsion of migrating SV2a neurons. While these results suggest that srGAPs play an important role in Slit repulsion during neuronal migration, it remains to be shown whether they are involved in Slit-mediated repulsive axon guidance.

# Modulation of Slit Signaling

The modulation of Robo signaling plays a critical role in the responsiveness of *Drosophila* commissural neurons to Slit at the CNS midline. The expression of Robo protein on commissural axons is dynamically regulated such that as these growth cones approach and cross the midline, Robo protein levels, which are very low prior to crossing, are rapidly upregulated postcrossing and prevent aberrant recrossing (Kidd et al. 1998, Tear et al. 1996). In contrast, ipsilaterally projecting neurons express high levels of Robo protein from the outset of axonogenesis, and this prevents their axons from ever crossing the CNS midline. A wealth of elegant genetic data shows that Robo protein levels on commissural axons are controlled by a type II transmembrane protein called commissureless (Comm), including the observations that, in *comm* mutants, no axons cross the CNS midline and that overexpression of Comm in all neurons results in all neurons converging on the midline (Kidd et al. 1998, Seeger et al. 1993, Tear et al. 1996). Recent observations demonstrate that Comm downregulates the axonal cell-surface levels of Robo protein by acting as an intracellular sorting receptor (Keleman et al. 2002). A conserved LPSY motif in the Comm cytoplasmic region is required for Comm/Robo association and serves to target Robo to the lysosome for degradation. As part of this regulatory circuit, Comm requires an association with the ubiquitin ligase Dnedd-4, which has been proposed to facilitate Robo ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation of Robo from the Comm neurons (Myat et al. 2002). However, ubiquitination of Robo itself has yet to be demonstrated. Thus far, no vertebrate Comm homologues have been identified. Therefore, regulation of vertebrate Slit-Robo repulsion may occur through alternative mechanisms, perhaps requiring interactions between Robos and other guidance receptors in a manner similar to what has been observed for Robo-mediated silencing of netrin attraction by Slit-Robo interactions (see below).

Levels of Robo receptors at the cell surface may also be regulated by proteolytic cleavage. Indeed, the metalloprotease Kuzbanian was recently shown to genetically interact with Slit in *Drosophila*, and expression of a dominant-negative

Kuzbanian molecule at the midline prevents downregulation of Robo cell-surface expression on commissural neurons (Schimmelpfeng et al. 2001). Finally, in vitro, the activities on DRG sensory neurons, of both the full-length form of Slit-2 and the N-terminal cleavage product, can be reversed by perturbing cGMP levels. This observation suggests that Slit-Robo interactions can be modulated by variations in the levels of cytosolic cyclic nucleotides (Nguyen-Ba-Charvet et al. 2001).

In addition to modulation of Slit signaling, Slit-Robo interactions are able to modulate responses to netrin through the formation of a heteromultimeric receptor complex with the netrin receptor DCC (Stein & Tessier-Lavigne 2001). This Slit-dependent activity of a heteromultimeric receptor complex, which includes Robo and DCC, results in the silencing of netrin-mediated attraction. Silencing provides a solution to the biological problem facing axons that cross the CNS midline during development because, subsequent to their attraction to the midline, these axons must rapidly overcome netrin attraction or they will languish at the midline and never escape. Using the Xenopus spinal neuron growth cone steering assay, Slit-2 was shown to antagonize netrin-induced growth cone attraction. In contrast, Slit-2 does not affect brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF)-mediated attraction or the netrin-induced increase in the rate of axon elongation. Expression of chimeric DCC and Robo receptors in spinal neurons shows that the silencing of netrin attraction by Slit-2 is a receptor-mediated effect involving the association of DCC and Robo-1 cytoplasmic domains. This interaction, mediated by the P3 region of DCC and the CC1 motif of Robo-1, is induced by Slit-2 binding to Robo-1. However, expression of myristoylated DCC and Robo-1 cytoplasmic domains in COS cells results in their constitutive interaction. These observations suggest that Slit-2 binding to Robo-1 may promote a conformational change in the Robo-1 receptor that allows for an association with DCC (Stein & Tessier-Lavigne 2001). Slit-mediated Robo signaling has also been recently shown to silence N-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. In this case Robo-N-cadherin association appears to be assembled in part by the Abl tyrosine kinase, which binds to the Robo CC3 domain and may hyperphosphorylate β-catenin, resulting in the uncoupling of N-Cadherin-mediated adhesion (Rhee et al. 2002). Finally, Slit-gated Robo activity has also been implicated in the inhibition of chemokine-induced leukocyte chemotaxis (Wu et al. 2001). Stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1-mediated leukocyte chemotaxis, which is signaled by its seven-transmembrane G protein–coupled receptor (GPCR) CXCR4, is inhibited by Slit-2, and this inhibition can be reconstituted in HEK cells that have been engineered to express both Robo and CXCR3. These examples serve to highlight that crossregulatory interactions involving diverse guidance cue receptors may establish absolute hierarchical responses to guidance cues that are sequentially encountered by growth cones during neural development.

## SEMAPHORINS

The semaphorins belong to a large family of phylogenetically conserved secreted and membrane-associated proteins, members of which are capable of mediating both repulsive and attractive axon guidance events during neural development
(reviewed in Raper 2000). Recently, the spectrum of biological functions attributed to semaphorins has been extended considerably to include roles in immune system function and development of the cardiovascular system (Brown et al. 2001, Feiner et al. 2001, Tordjman et al. 2002, Watanabe et al. 2001). The more than 30 semaphorins identified to date all share a conserved N-terminal Sema domain and can be classified into eight subfamilies depending on their structural similarities and species of origin (Semaphorin Nomenclature Committee 1999). Recent identification of molecules implicated in mediating or modulating semaphorin-induced responses has furthered our understanding of the intracellular cascades linking cell-surface semaphorin receptors to cytoskeletal components.

# Receptor Complexes

The plexins, a large family of evolutionarily conserved transmembrane proteins, are essential signal transducing components of most semaphorin receptor complexes (reviewed in Tamagnone & Comoglio 2000). Initial insights into plexin function came from the finding that a viral semaphorin, A39R, utilizes the B-lymphocyte protein VESPR (viral-encoded semaphorin receptor, now called Plexin C1) as a functional receptor (Comeau et al. 1998). Genetic and biochemical evidence in *Drosophila* identified Plexin A as the functional receptor for the transmembrane semaphorin Semal1a, which is required for repulsive guidance in motor axons (Winberg et al. 1998). Vertebrate Plexin B1 and Plexin C1 have been shown to directly bind to Sema4D (a.k.a. CD100) and the GPI-linked Sema7A, respectively (Takahashi et al. 1999, Tamagnone et al. 1999), and Sema4D/Plexin B1 signaling is required for Sema4D-mediated repulsion of hippocampal neurons in vitro (Swiercz et al. 2002).

Plexins cannot bind secreted class 3 semaphorins directly, but plexin A receptors form a complex with the neuropilin proteins, neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) or Npn-2, which function as obligate coreceptors and bind to class 3 semaphorins with high affinity (He & Tessier-Lavigne 1997, Kolodkin et al. 1997, Takahashi et al. 1999, Tamagnone et al. 1999). The specific responses of different classes of neurons to class 3–secreted semaphorins can be explained by the restricted and unique neuropilin expression patterns, the preferential binding of individual class 3 semaphorins to Npn-1 and/or Npn-2, and also by the unique patterns of neuronal plexin expression observed during neural development (Murakami et al. 2001, Nakamura et al. 2000). The neuropilins are transmembrane proteins with short, conserved, cytoplasmic tails that lack any known signaling motifs and are dispensable for propagating semaphorin repulsive signals (Nakamura et al. 1998). It is interesting that plexins contain a divergent Sema domain at their N-terminus which, in the absence of ligands, silences Plexin A1 signaling through intramolecular interactions. This autoinhibition is released upon binding of Sema3A to the plexin/neuropilin complex (Takahashi & Strittmatter 2001). Taken together, these and other observations, including that *plexin A3* mutant mice are deficient in class 3–secreted semaphorin repulsion (Cheng et al. 2001), establish that plexins are components of the receptor complex for certain classes of semaphorins (Figure 5).

Repulsion  
Attraction (Extension)  
Repulsion (Retraction)
Several other proteins constitute additional semaphorin receptor components. Secreted semaphorin signaling specificity is in part conferred by L1, a cell-adhesion molecule of the Ig super family (Ig CAM). L1 is an integral part of the Npn-1/Plexin A complex, which mediates the response of cortical and DRG axons to the repellent Sema3A but is not necessary for Sema3B, 3C, or 3E activity (Castellani et al. 2000). The recently demonstrated association of Plexin B1 with the receptor tyrosine kinase Met (the Scatter Factor 1/hepatocyte growth factor receptor) suggests an additional receptor component for class 4 transmembrane semaphorin signaling. Binding of Sema4D to Plexin B1 stimulates Met kinase activity, resulting in tyrosine phosphorylation of both receptors and promotion of invasive epithelial cell growth (Giordano et al. 2002). The *Drosophila* Off-track (OTK) protein was recently identified as being required for semaphorin signaling in motor axon guidance. OTK mutants show strong genetic interactions with *plexin A* mutants, and in tissue culture cells OTK copurifies with Plexin A (Winberg et al. 2001). OTK has homology with receptor tyrosine kinases; however, it belongs to the group of catalytically inactive kinase receptors. It is therefore probable that other kinases present in, or recruited to, the OTK/Plexin A complex participate in Plexin A signaling if indeed tyrosine phosphorylation is required for Semal1a/Plexin A/OTK-mediated repulsive axon guidance. Finally, CD72, a type 2 transmembrane protein belonging to the calcium-dependent C-type lectin super family, and Tim-2, which contains T-cell immunoglobulin domains and mucin domains, function in plexin-independent signaling in the immune system (Kumanogoh & Kikutani 2001; Kumanogoh et al. 2002a,b).

## Signaling Downstream of Semaphorin Receptors

The Rho family of GTPases appears to provide a critical link between semaphorin receptors and the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 5). Involvement of Rac1 in Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse was suggested by in vitro studies utilizing dominant-negative and constitutively active forms of Rac1 transfected into neurons (Jin & Strittmatter 1997). Further studies demonstrate that the GTP-dependent interaction between the cytoplasmic domain of vertebrate Plexin B1 and Rac1 inhibits Rac

**Figure 5** Semaphorin signaling. Invertebrate semaphorins bind directly to plexins. The large cytoplasmic protein MICAL interacts with Plexin A and may connect plexin signaling with a number of parallel signaling cascades regulating cytoskeletal dynamics. Invertebrate Plexin B interacts directly with Rac-GTP and RhoA, whereas the two Rho-specific GEFs, PDZ-RhoGEF and LARG, link mammalian plexin Bs to RhoA activation. Binding of Sema4D to the Plexin B1-Met receptor complex stimulates the tyrosine kinase activity of Met. Secreted class 3 semaphorins bind to neuropilins, which act as obligate ligand-binding subunits of holoreceptors containing plexin As as signal transducers. The IgCAM L1 associates with the Npn-1/plexin A complex and is required for Sema3A signaling in at least some neuronal populations.
downstream signaling by sequestering Rac away from its effector PAK (Driessens et al. 2001, Rohm et al. 2000, Vikis et al. 2000). It is interesting that Plexin B1-Rac interactions also modulate Sema4D binding to Plexin B1, thereby providing the first example of a small GTPase directly regulating receptor-ligand associations (Vikis 2002). Genetic experiments in *Drosophila* suggest that Plexin B, in addition to sequestering Rac<sup>GTP</sup>, directly binds to and activates RhoA (Hu et al. 2001). This is in contrast to vertebrate Plexin B1, which does not appear to directly interact with Rho (Vikis et al. 2002). Recently, two Rho-specific GEFs, PDZ-Rho-GEF and LARG, were shown to link mammalian plexin B proteins to RhoA activation (Aurandt et al. 2002, Chikumi et al. 2002, Hirotani et al. 2002, Perrot et al. 2002, Swiercz et al. 2002). Expression of a dominant-negative PDZ-Rho-GEF molecule in hippocampal neurons blocks Sema4D/Plexin B1-mediated growth cone collapse, providing evidence for semaphorin-dependent Rho activation. Despite clear differences between plexin B signaling in vertebrates and invertebrates, downregulation of Rac signaling and concurrent activation of Rho appear to be common strategies for triggering plexinB-dependent repulsive guidance.

In contrast to Rac and RhoA, which bind to different sites in the plexin B cytoplasmic domain, the GTPases Rnd1 and RhoD have been found to bind to the cytoplasmic domain of Plexin A1, competing for the same binding site (Zanata et al. 2002). This finding suggests that mechanisms used to modulate Rho GTPase activity differ between plexin subclasses. Rnd1 recruitment triggers signaling by Plexin A1, whereas binding of RhoD blocks Plexin A1 activation of Rnd1 and Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse.

The strong impact that semaphorin signaling has on F-actin dynamics is well documented (Fan et al. 1993, Fournier et al. 2000), and recently molecular links between Sema3A-induced chemorepulsion and actin reorganization have been demonstrated. Sema3A regulates actin dynamics through the phosphorylation of the actin-binding protein cofilin by the Ser/Thr kinase LIM-kinase (LIMK). This inactivates cofilin, decreasing its ability to promote actin filament turnover, and can account for the Sema3A dissolution of F-actin filaments (Aizawa et al. 2001) (Figure 5). A novel family of potential semaphorin signal transducers includes the protein collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP). CRMP was initially identified as a downstream cytoplasmic mediator of Sema3A signaling, possibly linking semaphorin signaling receptors to small G proteins (Goshima et al. 1995). Recent studies suggest that phosphorylation of CRMP-2 by ROCK is required for LPA-mediated growth cone collapse, whereas CRMP-2 appears to mediate Sema3A signaling independently of ROCK (Arimura et al. 2000). The Fes tyrosine kinase has been identified as a component of CRAM (CRMP-associated molecule)-CRMP complexes purified from brain (Mitsui et al. 2002). It is interesting that association between Fes and Plexin A1, and tyrosine phosphorylation of Plexin A1 by Fes, are both blocked by coexpression of Npn-1 with Fes and Plexin A1. This Npn-1-mediated inhibition is attenuated by stimulation with Sema3A. This observation suggests that Npn-1, in the absence of ligand, stabilizes an inactive conformation of Npn-1-Plexin A1 receptors and that Sema3A binding to Npn-1 induces a

conformational change in this complex. Though CRMP function in semaphorin-
mediated repulsion has been somewhat enigmatic, studies demonstrating that
CRMP-2 regulates axonogenesis and axon growth through interactions with the
microtubule cytoskeleton, in combination with work demonstrating CRMP-2 pro-
motion of axon outgrowth and collapse by Rac and Rho respectively, suggest
mechanisms by which CRMP-2 might integrate positive and negative effects on
axon outgrowth (Fukata et al. 2002, Gu & Ihara 2000, Hall et al. 2001, Inagaki
et al. 2001).

Given initial observations that plexin proteins are phosphorylated (Tamagnone
et al. 1999), it is interesting to note that several kinases in addition to those cited
above (Met and Fes) have been implicated in semaphorin/plexin signaling. Al-
though plexins do not have intrinsic kinase activity, Fyn, a member of the Src
family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases, associates with Plexin A1 and A2 and
can phosphorylate the Plexin A2 cytoplasmic domain (Sasaki et al. 2002). The
threonine-serine kinase cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk)5 is coimmunoprecipitated
with the neuropilin/plexin receptor complex in the presence of activated Fyn.
However, this association appears to be indirect and is likely mediated through
an interaction with activated Fyn. It has been suggested that Sema3A promotes
growth cone collapse through tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of Cdk5.
This finding could be mediated by Fyn, which can tyrosine phosphorylate Cdk5.
Because so far no direct interaction between plexin As and Rac-GTP has been
observed and because Cdk5 can downregulate PAK signaling, the Fyn/Cdk5 path-
way may serve to link plexin A signaling and cytoskeletal rearrangements. The
Ser/Thr kinase glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)-3 is yet another recently identified
potential downstream effector linking semaphorin signaling and actin dynamics.
An inactive, phosphorylated pool of GSK-3, which colocalizes with F-actin at the
leading edge of the growth cone, is activated upon Sema3A stimulation (Eickholt
et al. 2002). It remains to be determined whether cross talk exists between GSK-
3-dependent signaling pathways and Rho GTPase regulation of the growth cone
cytoskeleton.

Recently, the *Drosophila* MICAL (molecule interacting with CasL) protein, a
member of a phylogenetically conserved family of putative flavoprotein monooxy-
genases, was found to interact with Plexin A and to be required for Semala/Plexin
A-mediated repulsive motor axon guidance (Terman et al. 2002). Mutations that in-
activate the putative flavoprotein monooxygenase domain block Semala repulsion
in vivo in *Drosophila* motor neurons, and flavoprotein monooxygenase inhibitors
block Sema3A-mediated repulsion in vertebrate neurons. These results, in combi-
nation with a recent demonstration that 12/15-lipoxygenase activity is required for
Sema3A growth cone collapse (Mikule et al. 2002), suggest that redox signaling
plays an important role in semaphorin-mediated axonal repulsion. However, the
mechanism by which redox signaling influences this process is not known. MICAL
is a large, cytosolic protein containing multiple domains known to be important
for interactions with actin, intermediate filaments, and the adaptor protein CasL.
Because CasL transduces multiple signaling events from cell-surface receptors,

including integrin signaling, MICALs may serve to integrate plexins with a variety of signaling inputs that modulate cytoskeletal dynamics (O’Neill et al. 2000, Suzuki et al. 2002).

# Modulation of Semaphorin Signaling

Cytosolic levels of cyclic GMP (cGMP) can profoundly influence axonal responsiveness to class 3–secreted semaphorins. Elevating intracellular cGMP converts Sema3A-induced repulsion into attraction in the single growth cone turning assay (reviewed in Song & Poo 1999), and electrical activity is also able to enhance Sema3A repulsion, most likely through the diminution of cGMP levels (Ming et al. 2001). cGMP concentration may also act as an endogenous regulator of Sema3A signaling because pharmacological and histological evidence suggests that cortical neuron dendrites are attracted to Sema3A through the selective activity of soluble guanylyl cyclase localized to these dendrites (Polleux et al. 2000). It will be interesting to determine if indeed cGMP levels regulate neuronal responses to semaphorins in vivo. Recent work shows that local translation of mRNA within axons plays a key role in growth cone responses to multiple guidance cues. Both Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse and repulsive turning of Xenopus retinal ganglion cell growth cones are blocked by protein synthesis inhibitors. These are local events in the growing axon because application of these inhibitors to growth cones separated from their cell bodies blocks Sema3A-mediated growth cone collapse and turning (Campbell & Holt 2001). A future challenge is the identification of newly translated proteins required for repulsive guidance and also the machinery required for transporting these mRNAs to the growth cone.

# EPHRINS

Eph tyrosine kinases, receptors for the ephrins, are encoded by the largest family of receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) genes in the mammalian genome. These receptors are divided in two subclasses, EphA receptors (EphA1–EphA8), which bind the GPI-linked ephrin-As (ephrinA1–ephrinA5), and EphB receptors (EphB1–EphB6), which bind to transmembrane ephrin-Bs (ephrinB1–ephrinB3) (reviewed in Cuthforth & Harrison 2002, Wilkinson 2001). In addition to their prominent roles as regulators of axon guidance, ephrins and Ephs control many other biological functions including cell migration, vascular development, tissue-border formation, and synaptic plasticity (Knoll & Drescher 2002). Because ephrins are membrane attached, interactions between ephrins and Ephs require intercellular contact. It is remarkable that ephrin/Eph complexes transduce signals bidirectionally into both receptor (Eph)-expressing cells and ligand (ephrin)-expressing cells in what is known as “forward” and “reverse” signaling, respectively (reviewed in Kullander & Klein 2002). There is ample evidence to indicate that both forward and reverse modes of Ephrin-Eph signaling are critical for axon guidance during neural development. We refer the reader to several excellent reviews that discuss the functions

of ephrins and their receptors during neural development (Cooke & Moens 2002, Holmberg & Frisen 2002, Knoll & Drescher 2002, Wilkinson 2001), and we focus here on ephrin/Eph signaling mechanisms.

# Eph Receptor Forward Signaling

Upon ligand engagement Eph receptors undergo autophosphorylation in a manner similar to other RTKs. Precisely how Eph activation is translated into signals controlling cytoskeletal rearrangements has only recently been investigated, and, not surprisingly, it involves Rho family GTPases. The first evidence that Ephs control Rho family GTPases came from the observation that ephrin-A5 signaling in retinal ganglion axons leads to activation of RhoA and its effector ROCK and also to inactivation of Rac (Wahl et al. 2000). The subsequent identification of a novel GEF, ephexin (Eph-interacting exchange factor), has provided a direct functional link between EphA receptors, Rho GTPases, and the cytoskeleton (Shamah et al. 2001). Ephexin is constitutively bound to EphA4. Upon stimulation with EphA4, ephexin simultaneously activates RhoA and inhibits Cdc42 and Rac1, resulting in PAK inhibition (Figure 6). Thus, ephexin-mediated activation of ROCK and inactivation of PAK ultimately promotes growth cone collapse, presumably through mechanisms described above. In addition to the direct control of ephexin and Rho GTPases, activation of Eph receptors triggers inhibition of the GTPase Ras. Indeed, activation of EphB2 leads to inactivation of Ras, inactivation of the MAPK signaling pathway, and neurite retraction (Elowe et al. 2001, Miao et al. 2001). Precisely how Ephs control Ras activity remains to be determined, but this may involve SH2 domain-mediated recruitment and subsequent activation of a Ras-GAP (Holland et al. 1997). Finally, Ephs can both directly and indirectly associate with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Abl because Eph receptor signaling leads to dephosphorylation of Abl (Yu et al. 2001). Abl contains an actin-binding motif, and this provides a direct link between Ephs and the cytoskeleton.

# Ephin Reverse Signaling

Insights into reverse ephrin signaling mechanisms initially came from the observation that conserved tyrosine residues within cytoplasmic domains of ephrin-Bs are phosphorylated upon formation of ephrin-B/EphB complexes (Bruckner et al. 1997, Holland et al. 1996). Indeed, at least some of these conserved tyrosine residues can be phosphorylated by Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) and also by the fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor tyrosine kinases (Chong et al. 2000, Palmer et al. 2002). Tyrosine phosphorylation of ephrin-B cytoplasmic domains appears to mediate ephrin-B reverse signaling through the recruitment of the SH2/SH3 adaptor protein Grb4 (Figure 6). Grb4 binds via its SH2 domain to ephrin-B phosphotyrosine residues and regulates the activity of FAK (focal adhesion kinase), the redistribution of paxillin, and the disassembly of F-actin-containing stress fibers (Cowan & Henkemeyer 2001). The Grb4 SH3 domains bind to a unique set of regulatory proteins, including the

Abl-interacting protein-1 (Abi-1), which may serve as a link between Abl and the actin cytoskeleton (Dai & Pendergast 1995, Shi et al. 1995).

In addition to reverse signaling mediated by the conserved tyrosines, ephrin-Bs contain a C-terminal PDZ ligand motif that appears critical for reverse signaling. Subsequent to the rapid recruitment of Src family kinases and phosphorylation of conserved ephrin-B tyrosine residues, the PDZ domain–containing tyrosine phosphatase PTP-BL is recruited via its PDZ domain to the ephrin-B C-terminal PDZ ligand motif (Palmer et al. 2002). In addition to PTP-BL, several other PDZ-domain proteins can bind to ephrin-Bs, including glutamate-receptor-interacting-protein GRIP1 and -2 (Bruckner et al. 1999) and PDZ-RGS3 (Lu et al. 2001). The latter contains a regulator-of-heterotrimeric G protein–signaling (RGS3) domain, which can inhibit signaling downstream of receptors coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins such as the seven-transmembrane chemokine receptor CXCR4. The cellular responses induced by chemokine stromal-cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) activation of CXCR4 include leukocyte chemotaxis. SDF-1-induced cerebellar granule cell migration is inhibited by the stimulation of ephrin-B with EphB2 receptor bodies (Lu et al. 2001), and this effect is mediated by PDZ-RGS3. As mentioned above, Slit-Robo signaling can also inhibit SDF-1-induced leukocyte attraction (Wu et al. 2001); however, it is still unclear how this signal is transduced to CXCR4. These results support the idea that neuronal guidance cues may regulate biological processes involving chemotaxis through control of G protein–coupled activities.

The GPI-anchored ephrin-As also have reverse signaling potential (Knoll & Drescher 2002). In contrast to ephrin-Bs, whose recruitment to lipid raft microdomains is regulated (Bruckner et al. 1999), ephrin-As are constitutively clustered in these membrane compartments via their GPI anchors. Moreover, EphA receptor binding to ephrin-A5 induces compartmentalized signaling requiring the activation of the lipid raft-associated tyrosine kinase Fyn (Davy et al. 1999). Forward and reverse signaling for ephrin-A/EphA complexes may share at least some

Figure 6 Ephin/Eph receptor signaling. EphA receptors interact with GPI-anchored ephrin-As whereas the transmembrane ephrin-Bs bind to EphB receptors. Ephrin/Eph complexes propagate bidirectional signals. Forward signaling: The GEF ephexin links EphA receptors to Rho GTPases. Several additional pathways link ephrin/Eph signaling to regulation of adhesion: Binding of the phosphotyrosine phosphatase Shp-2 to EphA2 leads to inactivation of FAK and decreased integrin-mediated adhesion, whereas increased integrin-mediated adhesion is induced by ephrin-A via a Src-family-dependent pathway and by binding of Nck to activated EphB through the Nck-interacting kinase, NIK. Reverse signaling: Ephrin-As may transduce signals by aggregation with signaling molecules in membrane raft microdomains. SH2-domain-containing adaptor molecules such as Grb4 are recruited to phosphorylated ephrin-Bs. PDZ-RGS3, among other PDZ-binding proteins, binds to ephrin-Bs and may modulate G protein–coupled signaling to ephrins.
signaling intermediates. For example, activation of EphA2 triggers dephosphorylation of focal adhesion kinase (FAK), leading to reduced integrin-mediated adhesion (Miao et al. 2000, 2001), whereas activation of ephrin-As appears to promote an increase in adhesion via a β1 integrin-dependent mechanism (Davy & Robbins 2000, Huai & Drescher 2001). The mechanism by which reverse signaling through ephrin-A proteins occurs is unknown but is likely to involve one or more transmembrane domain-containing accessory receptors.

# Modulation of Ephrin/Eph Signaling

Two recent studies of ephrins and Ephs shed light on the mechanisms by which intermediate targets can modulate axonal responsiveness to guidance cues. In one example, regulated cleavage of ephrin-A2 by a metalloprotease, triggered by binding of the EphA3 receptor, terminates contact-mediated repulsion (Hattori et al. 2000). More recent experiments have shown that EphA2 mRNA is translated locally within distal axons after they have projected beyond their midline intermediate target regions (Brittis et al. 2002). These and other observations indicate that growing axons contain the machinery necessary for local translation and membrane insertion of guidance receptors, thereby potentially adjusting receptor profiles on growth cones and responsiveness to the local external environment.

# RECEPTOR PROTEIN TYROSINE PHOSPHATASES

Members of the large family of protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) have been implicated in a wide range of physiological processes including cell adhesion, cell migration, and development of the immune and nervous systems. Recently, receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) have emerged as key regulators of axon growth and guidance. The most compelling case for a role of RPTPs in axon guidance has been made in *Drosophila*, where the molecules DPTP69D and DLAR have been implicated in both the guidance of motor neuron axons (Desai et al. 1997, Krueger et al. 1996) and targeting of photoreceptor axons (Clandinin et al. 2001, Maurel-Zaffran et al. 2001). Moreover, mammalian RPTPδ, RPTPκ, and RPTPμ (Burden-Gulley et al. 2002, Drosopoulos et al. 1999, Sun et al. 2000, Wang & Bixby 1999) and chick PTPσ (Rashid-Doubell et al. 2002) have been implicated in the growth and guidance of several populations of developing vertebrate neurons.

# Ligands of RPTPs

In contrast to receptor tyrosine kinases, for which a large number of soluble ligands have been identified, most proteins found to associate with the ectodomains of transmembrane PTPs are themselves membrane bound. RPTPβ and RPTPα interact with the GPI-linked protein contactin *in trans* and *in cis*, respectively (Peles et al. 1998, Zeng et al. 1999). Furthermore, several RPTPs can interact homophilically *in trans* (Brady-Kalnay et al. 1993, Gebbink et al. 1993, Sap et al. 1994, Wang

& Bixby 1999). It is nonetheless possible that soluble proteins that remain to be identified also serve as ligands for RPTPs. Indeed, two members of the cytokine family of proteins, pleiotrophin and midkine, have recently been shown to bind to the extracellular domain of RPTPβ (Maeda et al. 1999, Maeda & Noda 1998). Clearly, the identification of additional proteins that interact with and modulate the activities of RPTPs represents a major future challenge.

# Signaling Downstream of RPTPs

The precise mechanism by which association between RPTPs and their ligands regulates RPTP signaling is still unclear. Nonetheless, inactivation of RPTPβ upon binding to its putative ligand, pleiotrophin, suggests that ligand-induced dimerization may downregulate the RPTP catalytic activity. This is consistent with findings in the immune system where the activity of the RPTP CD45 appears to be negatively regulated by dimerization (Desai et al. 1993; Majeti et al. 1998, 2000). Insight into the mechanism of RPTP inactivation comes from structural studies of RPTPα, revealing that its dimerization may block substrate access and thereby prevent substrate dephosphorylation (Bilwes et al. 1996). However, structural studies of two other RPTPs, RPTPμ and LAR, have not supported this proposed mechanism of inhibition of catalysis (Hoffmann et al. 1997, Nam et al. 1999). An alternate model for ligand-mediated inhibition of RPTP catalytic activity involves dimerization-induced trans-dephosphorylation of positively acting phosphotyrosine residues within the catalytic domains of RPTPs. Regardless of mechanism, both models suggest that ligand-induced dimerization and inactivation of catalytic activity serve as a means of initiating signaling. Inactivation of RPTP catalytic activity may thus lead to signal propagation or blockade through alterations in levels of key phosphotyrosine residues and, therefore, the binding of SH2 and PTB domain effector molecules (for additional reviews see Petrone & Sap 2000, Tonks & Neel 2001).

In addition to clustering of RPTPs through interactions with extracellular ligands, signaling and function of at least some RPTPs may also be modulated through clustering of these receptors with proteins that interact with RPTP intracellular domains. Members of the Liprin family of cytoplasmic proteins associate with the cytoplasmic domain of LAR (Serra-Pages et al. 1995, 1998), and this association alters the cellular localization of LAR and induces receptor clustering (Serra-Pages et al. 1998). Genetic analysis in *Drosophila* suggests that DLAR is also involved in synapse morphogenesis, and this function of DLAR appears to be dependent on its association with the cytoplasmic protein Dlirpin-α (Kaufmann et al. 2002). In addition, analysis of liprin function in *C. elegans* suggests a role for RPTPs in presynaptic differentiation (Zhen & Jin 1999). It is therefore possible that Dlirpin-α regulates DLAR function during synaptogenesis by clustering DLAR receptors or through the organization of large protein networks along the presynaptic membrane.

Although much remains to be learned about the nature of the signals initiated by engagement of either extracellular or intracellular domains of RPTPs, some

evidence suggests that RPTPs are critical regulators of Rho family GTPases. In *Drosophila* genetic interactions have been observed between DLAR and the Rho GTPase Rac in the control of guidance of motor axons (Kaufmann et al. 1998), and this may be mediated by the Rho GEF Trio. Indeed, human Trio physically associates with human LAR, and fly Trio genetically interacts with DLAR in motor axon guidance and photoreceptor axon targeting (Bateman et al. 2000, Debant et al. 1996, Maurel-Zaffran et al. 2001). However, the carboxy-terminal region of hTrio that mediates the association with human LAR is absent in *Drosophila* Trio and, coupled with certain phenotypic observations (Dickson 2001), suggests that vertebrate and *Drosophila* LAR regulate Trio through different mechanisms. DLAR also interacts genetically with both the Abl tyrosine kinase and its substrate Ena during motor neuron axon pathfinding in *Drosophila*, which suggests that Abl antagonizes, and Ena promotes, DLAR signaling in motor axons (Wills et al. 1999). Moreover, in vitro experiments suggest that DLAR directly interacts with and dephosphorylates both Abl and Ena (Wills et al. 1999). Thus, DLAR and possibly other RPTPs influence the actin cytoskeleton, at least in part, through Ena-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization and modulation of Rho family GTPase signaling.

## NEUROTROPHINS

The neurotrophin (NT) family is comprised of nerve growth factor (NGF), BDNF, NT-3, and NT-4. These factors play critical roles in the establishment and maintenance of the nervous system as well as in plasticity in the adult (Huang & Reichardt 2001, Sofroniew et al. 2001). Although their functions in vivo for neuronal survival, growth, and plasticity are now well established, determining whether neurotrophins function in vivo as chemoattractants for neuronal growth cones has proven difficult. Nevertheless, NGF can function as a potent attractant for cultured growth cones of chick sensory neurons (Gallo et al. 1997, Gundersen & Barrett 1979), and each of the neurotrophins can promote turning in acutely dissociated Xenopus spinal neurons (Ming et al. 1999, Song et al. 1997). Thus, neurotrophins are powerful modulators of growth cone steering in vitro, and recent experiments have provided insight into the chemotropic signaling mechanisms of these factors.

### Neurotrophin Receptor Signaling Mechanisms Controlling Chemotropism

Although p75 was the first identified neurotrophin receptor, members of the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases have received the most attention as signaling receptors for the neurotrophins. Like most receptor tyrosine kinases, initiation of signaling through Trks is triggered by ligand-dependent receptor dimerization and trans-phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domains leading to recruitment of SH2 and PTB domain-containing adaptor and effector proteins (Figure 7).

Figure 7 Major signaling cascades activated by the prototypic neurotrophin nerve growth factor (NGF). Binding of NGF to TrkA (left) induces trans-phosphorylation of TrkA and recruitment of adaptor and effector proteins to the receptor complex. The MAPK signaling cascade is activated through the actions of the small GTP-binding proteins Ras and Rap-1, as well as through activation of PLCγ-1. In addition, TrkA activates the PI3-kinase (PI3K) signaling cascade. The MAPK and PI3K pathways are implicated in mediating the growth and survival effects of neurotrophins, and PI3K may also modulate cytoskeletal rearrangements by regulating the activity of RhoG, which can activate Cdc42 and Rac. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor Trio can also activate RhoG. However, a direct link between TrkA signaling and Trio has yet to be demonstrated. NGF may also control actin cytoskeleton dynamics by binding to the p75NTR receptor (right) and inactivating RhoA.

adaptors and effectors couple Trk receptors to a variety of signaling pathways, including the Ras/MAPK, PI3K/AKT, and PLCγ-1 pathways. Indeed, these pathways are critical for the prosurvival and growth-promoting actions of neurotrophins, and their details are not covered here (Huang & Reichardt 2001, Sofroniew et al. 2001). Interesting recent experiments have indicated that at least some of the Trk effector pathways, well known for mediating the trophic effects of neurotrophins, appear to be key mediators of their tropic effects as well. The PI3K effector pathway mediates NGF's chemoattractant activity in the Xenopus steering assay (Ming et al. 1999). Consistent with this observation, PI3K is also required for

NT-4-dependent migration of cortical interneurons in vitro (Polleux et al. 2002). How does the PI3K pathway couple to the actin cytoskeleton to control NGF-dependent growth cone attraction? Although the answer to this question is not known, NGF induction of TrkA leads to activation of RhoG, Rac, and Cdc42 and inactivation of RhoA (Daniels et al. 1998, Estrach et al. 2002, Nusser et al. 2002, Sebok et al. 1999, Yamaguchi et al. 2001). Active forms of RhoG, Rac, Cdc42, and the effector kinase PAK each promote neurite outgrowth, whereas a constitutively active form of RhoA prevents NGF-dependent neurite outgrowth. A recent report suggests that NGF signals through the PI3K pathway to activate Rac and inactivate RhoA in PC12 cells (Nusser et al. 2002). Thus, one appealing model for controlling the actin cytoskeleton during NGF-dependent growth cone attraction involves TrkA-mediated PI3K signaling and the subsequent modulation of select Rho GTPases that control actin polymerization, branching, and growth cone advancement.

Although Trks have received the majority of attention as the key signaling receptors for neurotrophins in recent years, it is interesting to note that p75 can bind directly to RhoA and, therefore, may play a key role in growth cone motility (Figure 7) (Yamashita et al. 1999). In the absence of neurotrophin ligand, p75 appears to activate RhoA constitutively while ligand engagement leads to inactivation of RhoA. Thus, Trk receptors and p75 may collaborate to modulate Rho GTPases and the actin cytoskeleton.

Finally, as observed for other axon guidance cues such as netrins and semaphorins, whether a growth cone is attracted or repelled from a source of a neurotrophin can be influenced by the levels of cyclic nucleotides within the growth cone. For example, decreased levels of cAMP convert the attractive effects of NGF and BDNF into repulsion (Song et al. 1997). Responses to NT-3 mediated by TrkC can be dramatically modulated because inhibition of cGMP signaling, but not cAMP signaling, converts NT-3-mediated attraction into repulsion. The basis for this remarkable difference between the responsiveness of the various Trk receptors to cyclic nucleotides is not known, and it is essential to determine how exactly cAMP signaling functions in vivo to modulate neurotrophin responsiveness.

## Modulation of Semaphorin Signaling by Neurotrophins

In addition to functioning as attractants, neurotrophins can also modulate the responses of growth cones to other axon guidance molecules. For example, neurotrophins alter the responsiveness of DRG sensory neurons to the secreted semaphorin Sema3A (Tuttle & O’Leary 1998). Moreover, neurons grown in the presence of BDNF are more sensitive to Sema3A than neurons grown with NGF (Tuttle & O’Leary 1998). Finally, sensory neurons grown in media containing a high concentration of NGF are more resistant to Sema3A-induced growth cone collapse than neurons grown in a low concentration of NGF (Dontchev & Letourneau 2002). Again, determining whether neurotrophins modulate responsiveness to semaphorins and/or other axon guidance cues in vivo remains a high priority.

CELL-ADHESION RECEPTORS

Cell-adhesion receptors, including Ig cell-adhesion molecules (CAMs), cadherins, and integrins, direct axon guidance events and many additional developmental processes through interactions with ligands present in the extracellular matrix (ECM) or on neighboring cells. Here we briefly introduce the major families of cell-adhesion receptors and discuss their modes of intracellular signaling.

Within the immunoglobulin (Ig) super family is a large subfamily comprised of a diverse group of CAMs defined by the presence of one or more Ig-like domains (Brummendorf & Rathjen 1995). The best characterized Ig CAMs in the nervous system are neural CAMs (NCAM) and their close relative L1. Another large family, the cadherins (calcium-dependent adherent proteins), are a structurally distinct family of cell-adhesion receptors, the prototypes of which are the classical cadherins containing single-pass transmembrane proteins, five cadherin repeats in the ectodomain, and a highly conserved cytoplasmic region (Angst et al. 2001, Juliano 2002). Other cadherins, such as T-cadherin, contain similar ectodomains but are attached to the plasma membrane through GPI anchors, whereas the protocadherins contain more than five cadherin repeats and have cytoplasmic domains that are structurally distinct from those of the classical cadherins. N-cadherin, the best characterized classical neural cadherin, plays important roles in early axon growth and fasciculation as well as stabilization of connections of retinal axons with their synaptic targets (reviewed in Ranscht 2000). Finally, integrins are a large family of heterodimeric cell-surface receptors, composed of noncovalently associated α and β subunits, that provide physical links between the ECM and the cytoskeleton. Recent genetic experiments in *Drosophila* implicate integrins as modulators of axon guidance cues and suggest that the strength of integrin-mediated adhesion influences growth cone responsiveness to axon guidance cues (Stevens & Jacobs 2002).

## Receptor Complexes

Many Ig CAMs, including L1, NCAM, and Sidekicks (Sdks), bind homophilically *in trans* in a manner that supports intercellular adhesion and which appears to underlie processes such as growth cone guidance, axon fasciculation, and target recognition. Indeed, Sdk-1 and -2, which are implicated as determinants of lamina-specific synaptic connectivity in the chick retina, bind homophilically *in trans* to promote formation or stabilization of synapses (Yamagata et al. 2002). In addition, a subset of Ig CAMs have been shown to interact heterotypically with other Ig CAMs, integrins, and receptor protein tyrosine phosphatases (RPTPs) (Crossin & Krushel 2000). It is interesting that some homo- or heterophilic Ig CAM interactions can occur *in cis* and may influence both the adhesive properties and signaling capabilities of these proteins. Indeed, cis-assisted trans-interactions may be a binding mechanism common to many CAMs (Kunz et al. 2002). Like Ig CAMS, cadherins can also undergo homophilic interactions, and these interactions

occur between the cadherin repeat domains presented on receptors on apposing cells (Sivasankar et al. 1999). Unlike the other families of cell-adhesion receptors, many of the cadherins contain cytoplasmic tails that are directly linked to the actin-based cytoskeleton through a group of conserved intracellular proteins, the catenins (Gumbiner 2000). The regulation of cadherin-catenin complex formation, therefore, influences intercellular adhesive strength. Unlike Ig CAMs and cadherin family members, which can undergo homophilic interactions, integrins bind heterophilically to a diverse set of ligands which include ECM proteins and certain cell-surface Ig CAM super family proteins. Likewise, certain integrin ligands such as laminins, collagens, and fibronectin can bind to multiple integrins (Hynes et al. 1987). The cytoplasmic domains of most integrins are short and lack catalytic activity; intracellular signals that emanate from integrins are mediated by the direct association with adaptor proteins. The functions of Ig CAMs, cadherins, and integrins during axon growth, guidance, fasciculation, and synapse formation are reviewed extensively elsewhere (Milner & Campbell 2002, Ranscht 2000, Skaper et al. 2001).

# Signaling Downstream of Cell-Adhesion Receptors

Engagement of all three families of cell-adhesion receptors activates several signaling pathways, including MAPK cascades. Stimulation of NCAM, L1, and N-cadherin through homophilic binding *in trans* leads to phosphorylation and activation of the FGF receptor tyrosine kinase (FGFR), which triggers a signaling cascade involving PLCγ, DAG lipase, production of arachidonic acid, increases in intracellular calcium levels, and subsequent activation of MAPK signaling (Skaper et al. 2001). Support for this model as a means for NCAM signaling is provided by the findings that expression of a dominant-negative FGFR inhibits both NCAM-induced FGFR phosphorylation and axon outgrowth (Saffell et al. 1997). A second model for NCAM-signaling MAPK is built upon observations that NCAM associates with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Fyn, which provides an alternative way of activation of MAPK signaling. NCAM-dependent neurite outgrowth is selectively abolished in *fyn* null neurons (Beggs et al. 1994). Indeed, NCAM clustering induces recruitment of FAK to the NCAM-Fyn complex, resulting in transient phosphorylation of both Fyn and FAK (Beggs et al. 1997). These phosphorylation events trigger the recruitment of adaptor proteins, which initiate Ras-MAPK pathway signaling directed toward the transcription factor cAMP response-element binding protein CREB (Schmid et al. 1999, 2000) and other nuclear and cytoplasmic targets. Thus, it appears that NCAM-mediated neurite outgrowth proceeds through at least two signaling pathways involving FGFR and Fyn, both of which converge on the MAPK pathway (Jessen et al. 2001, Kolkova et al. 2000). L1, on the other hand, associates with the non-receptor tyrosine kinase Src (Maness et al. 1996) and activates the MAPK cascade through Rac and PI3K. It appears that the L1 complex requires internalization in order to elicit signaling (Schaefer et al. 1999, Schmid et al. 2000).

Cell-adhesion receptor families share at least some signaling intermediates that serve to couple them to the MAPK pathway. Like NCAM, integrin-mediated adhesion is also coupled to the MAPK cascade through tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of FAK. FAK is recruited to focal adhesions either through direct association with the cytoplasmic tail of integrin $\beta$ subunits or indirectly by interacting with the cytoplasmic proteins talin and paxillin (Chen et al. 1995, Miyamoto et al. 1995, Schaller et al. 1995). Phosphorylation of FAK induces SH2-domain-mediated recruitment of both Src and the Grb-2/mSOS complex to FAK. Recruitment of the Ras GEF mSOS triggers activation of Ras and Erk (Juliano 2002, Schlaepfer et al. 1999). FAK also interacts with p130Cas, a member of the Cas family of docking proteins, which recruits the adaptor proteins Crk and Nck on Src phosphorylation and leads to activation of another MAPK, the c-Jun kinase (Richardson & Parsons 1996, Schlaepfer et al. 1997, Vuori et al. 1996). A second, FAK-independent, mode of integrin-mediated activation of the Erk MAPK pathway involves the Src family kinase Fyn and the adaptor protein Shc. Certain integrin heterodimers also activate Fyn (Wary et al. 1996, 1998), possibly through association with the transmembrane protein caveolin-1, which may serve as an adaptor in this pathway. Activated Fyn recruits and phosphorylates the adaptor Shc, and this recruitment, in turn, leads to SH2 domain-mediated recruitment of the Grb2/mSOS complex and activation of the Erk pathway (reviewed in Giancotti & Ruoslahti 1999).

In addition to the MAPK pathways, activation of both integrins and cadherins triggers rearrangements in the actin cytoskeleton by regulating Rho family GTPases (Clark et al. 1998, Price et al. 1998, Ren et al. 1999, Kaibuchi et al. 1999). Recent results show that integrin activation facilitates the association between Rac and PAK at the membrane, thereby promoting PAK activation (del Pozo et al. 2000). Whereas mechanisms of integrin-mediated modulation of Rho GTPases have yet to be delineated, RhoA activity is suppressed through stimulation of p190RhoGAP (Arthur & Burridge 2001, Arthur et al. 2000), which itself appears to be controlled by Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and integrin action (Billuart et al. 2001, Ng et al. 2002). In the case of cadherins, receptor engagement decreases the activity of RhoA and increases the activity of Rac1 (Noren et al. 2001). Additionally, as mentioned above, catenins directly couple cadherins to the actin cytoskeleton (reviewed in Juliano 2002). Thus, while $\beta$-catenin and $\gamma$-catenin bind directly to cytoplasmic tails of cadherins, they also interact with $\alpha$-catenin, which binds both directly and indirectly with actin filaments (Gumbiner 2000). Regulation of cadherin-catenin complexes in many cell types, through the activities of several kinases, phosphatases, and Rho GTPases, affects adhesive strength (Fukata & Kaibuchi 2001, Gumbiner 2000); however, how these complexes are regulated during neuronal adhesion and axon guidance remains to be fully appreciated.

Some Ig CAMs can signal to the cytoskeleton through pathways other than the MAPK and Rho pathways. The drosophila Ig CAM, Dscam, which negatively controls the bifurcation of sister axon branches in vivo (Wang et al. 2002a), binds directly to the SH3/SH2 adaptor protein DOCK. This Dscam/DOCK complex,

in turn, activates the serine/threonine kinase PAK and can direct sensory axon pathfinding in Drosophila (Schmucker et al. 2000). This pathway could couple Dscam to both LIMK and MLCK to influence growth cone advancement (see above). In addition, DSH3PX1, a member of the nixin family of proteins, may couple Dscam to WASP, a component of the Arp2/3 complex that regulates nucleation of F-actin filaments (Worby et al. 2001).

# Modulation of Cell-Adhesion Receptor Signaling

Integrins and Ig CAMs transduce bidirectional signals across the cell membrane. The “inside-out” mode of signal transduction may be a means by which intracellular signaling pathways indirectly control cytoskeletal organization and growth cone motility. In one interesting example, integrin affinity for extracellular ligands can be regulated by Ras family GTPases (Parise et al. 2000); Ras exerts inhibitory effects, while R-Ras and Rap1 promote high-affinity interactions between integrins and their ligands (Zhang et al. 1996). Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain R-Ras-mediated integrin activation, including suppression of the Ras/Erk/MAPK cascade (Hughes et al. 1997, Sethi et al. 1999). The ability of R-Ras to control cell adhesion may also be regulated through binding of the SH3 domain-containing adapter protein Nck, which may then provide a link to integrins as well as to the cytoskeletal-associated protein WASP (Wang et al. 2000).

Another way of controlling CAM-mediated adhesion is through the regulation of the number of CAM molecules present at the cell surface. For example, L1 is recycled from the central domain of an advancing growth cone to its leading edge, thereby creating an asymmetric distribution of L1-mediated adhesion along the outer surface of an advancing growth cone. This asymmetric distribution appears to be critical for the control of growth cone advancement (Kamiguchi & Lemmon 2000). Modulation of cell-surface expression of CAMs can also be achieved through proteolytic cleavage of their ectodomains (Gutwein et al. 2000, Nayeem et al. 1999).

# MYELIN-ASSOCIATED INHIBITORS: Nogo, MAG, OMgp

The recent identification and characterization of neurite growth-inhibitory molecules associated with myelin and oligodendrocytes provides insight into the mechanisms that prevent axonal regeneration in the adult mammalian system. Although these molecules have mostly been studied in the context of their ability to inhibit regeneration, their expression in the CNS and PNS during neural development suggests they may also play a role in the growth and guidance of axons. In addition, the well-characterized intracellular signaling events that transduce repulsive effects of several axon guidance cues during neural development provide an excellent starting point for determining the basis of repulsive and inhibitory guidance in the mature nervous system. We discuss below three myelin-associated inhibitors

for which receptors have been identified: myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG), Nogo, and oligodendrocyte-myelin glycoprotein (OMgp) (Figure 8).

# Neurite Growth Inhibitory Ligands

MAG, a member of a subgroup of the immunoglobulin (Ig) super family containing five Ig-like domains (Salzer et al. 1987), is a well-characterized component of both CNS and PNS myelin (reviewed in Qiu et al. 2000). The location of MAG on central and peripheral glial cells, together with its potent and developmentally regulated inhibitory effects on neurite outgrowth, shows that MAG is likely to inhibit axon outgrowth through binding to a neuronal receptor (McKerracher et al. 1994, Mukhopadhyay et al. 1994).

Identification of Nogo-A as the antigen of the monoclonal antibody (mAb) IN-1 represented an important step in the elucidation of myelin-associated growth inhibition (Chen et al. 2000, GrandPre et al. 2000, Prinjha et al. 2000, Huber & Schwab 2000). mAb IN-1 was previously shown to neutralize the neurite growth-inhibitory activity of differentiated oligodendrocytes and myelin substrates in culture. When applied in vivo, IN-1 promotes regenerative fiber growth following lesions to several different adult rat CNS pathways (Schwab & Bartholdi 1996). Nogo belongs to the reticulon protein family, and all three Nogo isoforms (Nogo-A, -B, and -C) share a common C-terminal domain of 188 amino acids containing two hydrophobic domains with membrane-spanning potential separated by a hydrophilic region of 66 amino acids (Nogo-66). In vitro studies suggest that at least two Nogo domains mediate the growth-inhibitory activities of Nogo-A. One region in the N-terminal Nogo-A-specific region has an inhibitory effect on axonal growth and spreading of nonneuronal cells, whereas Nogo-66 inhibits axonal growth in neurons without altering the morphology of nonneuronal cells (Chen et al. 2000, Fournier et al. 2001, GrandPre et al. 2000).

OMgp has been known for some time to be a potent inhibitory component of CNS myelin, and it is expressed by mature oligodendrocytes and enriched in myelin layers adjacent to axons (Habib et al. 1998, Mikol et al. 1990, Mikol & Stefansson 1988). OMgp is a GPI-linked protein that contains multiple LRRs. Its recent reisolation in a protein fraction capable of collapsing DRG growth cones obtained from phospholipase C–treated myelin (Wang et al. 2002b,c), and from peanut agglutinin (PNA)-agarose chromatography of inhibitory protein fractions isolated from CNS myelin (Kottis et al. 2002), underscores the potential for OMgp to participate along with other myelin-inhibitory components in myelin-mediated inhibition of axon extension.

# Receptor Complexes and Downstream Signaling

Following molecular characterization of Nogo, Nogo receptor (NgR), a GPI-linked LRR-containing neuronal protein, was identified (Figure 8) (Fournier et al. 2001). Nogo-66 binds with high affinity to NgR, and expression of NgR confers Nogo-66 responsiveness to neurons that do not normally express it. It is remarkable that

both MAG and OMgp also utilize NgR for the repulsive activities of these myelin-derived repellents (Domeniconi et al. 2002, Liu et al. 2002, Wang et al. 2002c). Determining the precise location of the binding sites on NgR for these three ligands is extremely important in order to design molecules capable of modulating NgR function. This is highlighted by the important demonstration that administration of an antagonistic Nogo-66 peptide in vivo following spinal cord hemisection lesions results in long-distance regeneration and functional recovery (GrandPre et al. 2002). Taken together, these observations identify NgR as a common signaling receptor for three inhibitory myelin proteins and raise the possibility that NgR is part of the receptor complex that mediates in vivo myelin-inhibitory cues.

Because NgR is a GPI-linked protein, it most likely functions in a complex with other transmembrane protein(s) capable of transducing inhibitory signals to neurons. Recently the low-affinity neurotrophin receptor p75 was identified as a component of the holoreceptor complex, which, along with the NgR, mediates Nogo-, MAG-, and OMgp-inhibitory effects on neurons (Wang et al. 2002b). These exciting findings include a demonstration that DRG neurons from $p75--$ mice are insensitive to the growth-inhibitory effects of myelin and all three NgR ligands (Wang et al. 2002b). These results suggest that in vivo NgR and p75 may constitutively associate but that, following ligand binding, formation of NgR-p75 receptor complex is enhanced. It is interesting that p75 has also been shown to specifically associate with the ganglioside GT1b (Yamashita et al. 2002). MAG, which is a member of the siglec family, can also bind to gangliosides, most notably GT1b and GD1a, in a sialic acid–dependent manner (Collins et al. 1997, Vinson et al. 2001). Blocking experiments with antibodies against GT1b and GD1a suggest these gangliosides may also act as MAG receptors (Vyas et al. 2002), though it is important to note that MAG-NgR interactions are sialic acid independent (Domeniconi et al. 2002). One possibility is that these gangliosides play a role in assembling the NgR holoreceptor complex. MAG can activate RhoA in a p75-dependent manner, while neurotrophin binding to p75 inhibits RhoA activity (Yamashita et al. 1999). Rho GTPases have also been implicated in transducing MAG- and Nogo-mediated inhibition because inactivation of RhoA in neurons by the drug C3 convertase blocks

Figure 8 Myelin-associated neurite growth-inhibitory ligands. Several components of CNS myelin, including Nogo, MAG, and OMgp, participate in neurite growth inhibition. The Nogo-66 receptor (NgR) appears to be a common ligand-binding receptor for all three oligodendrocyte-derived ligands. Recent evidence suggests that ligand binding to the GPI-linked NgR initiates a signal that is transduced within neuronal growth cones by the neurotrophin receptor p75, which activates the small GTPase RhoA. NgR and p75 interact constitutively, and ligand binding to NgR enhances receptor complex formation. In a distinct pathway, MAG may also signal through sialic acid-dependent binding to the ganglioside GT1b, which also appears to associate with p75.

the inhibition of growth on myelin and also on MAG or Nogo (Bandtlow & Schwab 2000, Lehmann et al. 1999). Therefore, all of these data suggest that p75 occupies a central position as a receptor component for several myelin inhibitors and has the potential to serve as a switch between neurotrophin-mediated promotion of process outgrowth and myelin-promoted process inhibition. It will be very interesting to determine exactly how neurotrophins modulate myelin-mediated repulsion transduced by either a p75-NgR holoreceptor complex or p75 acting alone.

Apart from a potential role for RhoA, little is known about downstream signaling events evoked within the growth cone by Nogo. However, cytosolic calcium transients may play a role in mediating this growth cone response. Nogo (NI-35/250)-evoked growth cone collapse is preceded by a rapid and large increase in the concentration of cytosolic Ca²⁺, which can affect actin and tubulin polymerization (Schliwa 1981, Yamamoto et al. 1983) through release from intracellular stores (Bandtlow & Loschinger 1997, Bandtlow et al. 1993). It is interesting in this light to note that Ca²⁺ transients in neuronal filopodia and growth cones are inversely correlated with axonal extension, promote repulsive turning, and, therefore, may underlie the effects of myelin repellents on adult neurons (Gomez et al. 2001, Gomez & Spitzer 1999).

# Modulation of Myelin-Associated Inhibitor Signaling

MAG is a bifunctional molecule that promotes axonal growth in embryonic neurons yet inhibits neurite growth in postnatal neurons (McKerracher et al. 1994, Mukhopadhyay et al. 1994, DeBellard et al. 1996, Johnson et al. 1989). This developmental switch in the responsiveness to MAG correlates with a marked decrease in intracellular cAMP levels (Cai et al. 2001). Administration of high levels of growth factors to neurons isolated from early developmental stages elevates cytosolic cAMP levels, activates protein kinase A (PKA), and renders these embryonic neurons insensitive to MAG inhibition, most likely through Rho inactivation (Cai et al. 1999). Similar effects are observed after “priming” older neurons in culture with neurotrophins before they encounter MAG, after a conditioning peripheral lesion in DRG neurons, which promotes CNS regeneration of a subsequently lesioned central projection from these same neurons, or after electrical stimulation of neurons growing in culture on MAG, which also serves to elevate cAMP levels (Ming et al. 2001, Neumann & Woolf 1999, Oudega et al. 1994, Richardson & Issa 1984). Injection of cAMP following a central DRG lesion results in the promotion of central regeneration of these projections, providing one avenue for translation of these observations into the therapeutic realm (Neumann et al. 2002, Qiu et al. 2002).

PKA substrates include IP3 receptors (Haug et al. 1999) and also a number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins (Qiu et al. 2000). PKA-dependent phosphorylation of RhoA leads to termination of RhoA signaling (Lang et al. 1996, Laudanna et al. 1997), and this provides one mechanism by which inhibitory effects of myelin might be overcome and regeneration and functional recovery promoted (Dergham et al. 2002, Lehmann et al. 1999). cAMP/PKA signaling also upregulates

transcription of genes that facilitate the regeneration process. Recently, cAMP signaling was shown to promote expression of Arginase I, which is rate limiting for the production of polyamines (Cai et al. 2002). Mimicking in mature DRGs the high endogenous Arginase I levels present early in development can block the switch from MAG promotion to inhibition. How polyamines alter the growth-inhibitory effect of MAG, however, remains to be determined.

# CONCLUSIONS

Though many neuronal guidance cues and their receptors likely remain to be discovered, it is now clear from analysis of several distinct families of axon guidance cues and their receptors that many of the same signaling intermediates are employed by all of these cues to control cytoskeletal dynamics and subsequent alterations in neuronal growth cone behavior. Indeed, as discussed above, Rho GTPases play prominent roles as mediators of signals generated by most, if not all, guidance cue receptors. It is interesting that the mechanisms by which guidance cue receptors couple to Rho GTPases and other common signaling intermediates appear to differ significantly. Whereas some receptors, such as the vertebrate semaphorin receptor Plexin B1 and the neurotrophin receptor p75, interact directly with Rho GTPases, most receptors are coupled to Rho GTPases through GEFs, GAPs, and other adaptors and signaling intermediates. Common themes have also emerged with the identification of both extracellular and intracellular processes that modulate the responses of growth cones to extracellular cues. These processes include protein translation within growth cones, receptor processing and targeting to the cell surface, and protease-mediated cleavage from the plasma membrane. Furthermore, it is now well established that individual guidance cue receptors belonging to different families can establish a hierarchy of responses to different cues. This can occur either through direct interactions between receptors, as seen in Slit silencing of netrin attraction, or through cross talk between intracellular signaling cascades, an example being FAK-mediated signaling by both Eph and integrin receptors. These and other types of modulation and cross talk are likely to prove critical as growth cones encounter a myriad of guidance cues during their navigation along long and tortuous paths toward final targets and require rapid desensitization to one cue and sensitization to another in order to proceed. Indeed, because of our evolving understanding of families of guidance cues, their receptors, and intracellular signaling and cross talk mechanisms, great progress is now being made in determining precisely how connectivity within the nervous system is achieved.

During the next several years we can expect to gain a more complete picture of how complexes of guidance cue receptors and intracellular signaling machinery are organized at the growth cone surface and of the logic that underlies coordinated regulation of cytoskeletal components. Ultimately, in addition to furthering our understanding of how during neural development a growth cone ultimately arrives at its target, we can expect some of these same processes to underlie synapse

formation and adult plasticity. Finally, though there are likely to be both differences and similarities between the guidance cues and receptors, which operate in the adult and embryonic nervous systems, many of the underlying mechanisms will likely be found to be conserved. This lends therapeutic relevance to what we have learned thus far about how the growth cone cytoskeleton is linked to the extracellular environment and how this linkage defines neural connectivity.
