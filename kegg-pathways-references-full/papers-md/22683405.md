#### ABSTRACT

Hippo pathway, originally discovered in *Drosophila*, is responsible for organ size control. The pathway is conserved in mammals and has a significant role in restraining cancer development. Regulating the Hippo pathway thus represents a potential therapeutic approach to treat cancer, which however requires deep understanding of the targeted pathway. Despite our limited knowledge on the pathway, there are increasing discoveries of new molecules that regulate and modulate the Hippo downstream signaling particularly in various solid malignancies, from extracellular stimuli or via pathway crosstalk. Herein, we discuss the roles of newly identified and key regulators that connect with core components (MST1/2, LATS1/2, SAV1, and MOB1) and downstream effector (YAP) in the Hippo pathway having an important role in cancer development and progression. Understanding of the mammalian Hippo pathway regulation may shed new insights to allow us selecting the right oncogenic targets and designing effective drugs for cancer treatments.

dysregulation or inappropriate activation of these pathways can lead to uncontrolled cell proliferations and eventually tumorigenesis.

Hippo pathway is a novel developmental pathway that is found frequently dysregulated in many solid tumors. The regulation of this pathway is complex, as indicated by the diverse types of regulators identified so far, which affect different downstream targets of the Hippo signaling in a tissue-specific manner. We here discuss the key molecular links between these regulators and core components of the Hippo pathway.

### 2. Core components of the Hippo pathway

Most of the Hippo pathway components were discovered in *Drosophila melanogaster* using genetic screens, initially for identifying novel tumor suppressors. Core components of the Hippo pathway include kinases: Hippo (Hpo) and Warts, and adaptor proteins: Salvador (Sav) and Mob as tumor suppressor (Mats) [4–9]. Hpo autophosphorylates and also phosphorylates Warts, Sav, and Mats. Sav couples the phosphorylation from Hpo to Warts, and Mats binds to Warts to enhance its catalytic activity. Warts then negatively regulates a transcriptional co-activator—Yorkie, mainly by phosphorylating it to promote cytoplasmic retention through 14-3-3 protein binding [10,11]. In the event of growth signal or stimuli that the Hippo signaling is attenuated or inhibited, Yorkie translocates into nucleus and binds to different DNA-binding proteins to mediate transcription of target genes, such as cyclin E [6–9], bantam microRNA [12,13], and diap1 [8,9]. These Yorkie-targeted genes are often involved in cell proliferation and tissue growth.

Hippo pathway is highly conserved in mammal—some of the human homologs can rescue their corresponding overgrowth phenotype of *Drosophila* mutant in vivo [9,14,15]. Each of the core components of the *Drosophila* Hippo pathway has at least one ortholog in mammals: 1) Hpo: mammalian sterile 20-like kinases 1 and 2 (MST1 and MST2, referred as MST1/2), 2) Warts: large tumor suppressor 1 and 2 (LATS1 and LATS2, referred as LATS1/2), 3) Mats: Mps Once Binder kinase activator-like 1(MOB1), 4) Sav: SAV1, also known as WW45, 5) Yorkie: Yes-associated protein (YAP). TAZ, also known as WWTR1, is a paralog of YAP. The regulation of YAP/TAZ is in a similar fashion as in *Drosophila*, in which LATS1/2 directly phosphorylates YAP/TAZ, promoting its cytoplasmic localization [10,16] (Fig. 1).

To date, the upstream components of the Hippo core kinases remain largely elusive. They are better characterized in *Drosophila* than in mammal. The atypical cadherin Fat (Ft) is the first transmembrane protein implicated in Hippo pathway in *Drosophila* [17–20]. It interacts with another atypical cadherin Dachsous (Ds). The Ft and Ds function as receptor and ligand, respectively, to control Hippo activity—affect target gene transcription [18,21]. Such control has not been entirely elucidated, but is believed, in part, to mediate through interacting with the FERM domain protein Expanded (Ex) and Merlin [17,19,22]. These FERM-containing proteins can bind to KIBRA, which together regulates Hippo pathway components [23–25].

The homologs of Ft, Merlin, and KIBRA are tumor suppressor homolog 4 (FAT4), neurofibromin 2 (NF2), and KIBRA, respectively. They all have been suggested as upstream components of the Hippo pathway in mammals. FAT4 and Ds regulate the apical plasma membrane organization [26]. A study showed that Ds mutant and FAT4 mutant mice exhibit similar phenotypes, and the Ds and FAT4 double mutants resemble the single mutants, with the reductions in the size of certain internal organs, including intestine, lung, and kidney [27]. Nevertheless, effects on YAP or LATS1 were not detected in Ds or FAT4 mutants, suggesting that Ds-FAT4 regulatory signal may only affect Hippo components in limited context. NF2, a bona fide human tumor suppressor, has been suggested as one of the Hippo pathway regulatory axes. A recent in vivo study showed that the conditional knockout of NF2 in liver led to hepatocellular carcinoma and bile duct hamartoma, while the knockout phenotypes were suppressed by heterozygous deletion of YAP [28]. Importantly, reduction of both YAP and LATS1/2 phosphorylation was observed in NF-2 deficient livers, suggesting YAP as a downstream target regulated by NF2 in growth control. KIBRA could also feed into the Hippo pathway through LATS1/2 [29], and the connection is discussed in Section 7.

**Fig. 1.** Hippo pathway signal transduction in response to growth signals. Hippo pathway is highly conserved across species from *Drosophila melanogaster* to human, with the mammalian sterile 20-like kinase (MST1/2) and large tumor suppressor 1/2 (LATS1/2) as the core component kinases while Yes-associated protein (YAP) as the pathway effector. Left panel: During development, MST1/2 and LATS1/2 remain inactive, allowing YAP translocation into the nucleus to activate a set of genes regulating cell survival and proliferation. Right panel: In response to growth inhibitory signal (e.g. cell–cell contact), MST1/2 in active form phosphorylates LATS1/2 that sequentially phosphorylates YAP at Ser-127. The phosphorylated YAP is retained and later subjected to degradation in the cytoplasm.

3. Dysregulation of the Hippo pathway in cancer

Many of the Hippo pathway components demonstrate prominent tumor suppressive functions. It was well demonstrated that mouse livers deficient of MST1/2 over-grew beyond the normal size and ultimately developed tumors [30,31]. In fact, dysregulation of Hippo pathway is implicated in many types of cancers; for instance, FAT4 is mutated in 5% (6/110) of patients with gastric cancer [32], while SAV1 is gene mutated in colon and renal cancer cell lines [5]. Furthermore, reduced expression of MST1/2 and LATS1 was found in gastric cancer, and tumors with lymph node metastasis showed minimal levels of LATS1 [33]. In hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), YAP oncogene is frequently amplified [34] and overexpression of YAP protein is associated with poor prognostic outcomes of the patients [35]. On the contrary, LATS1 regulated YAP activity has been frequently found under expressed in various types of liver malignancies including HCC, cholangiocarcinoma and hepatoblastoma [36]. Malignant mesothelioma was demonstrated to have suppressed LATS2 levels [37]. Although the underlying mechanisms of Hippo dysregulation remain to be defined, there are increasing evidences showing that the pathway alterations may be caused by genetic or epigenetic changes. For example, promoter region of MST1/2 gene is hypermethylation in soft tissue sarcoma [38], and loss of heterozygosity of LATS2 is often found in human cancers [39]. Nevertheless, the regulation of the Hippo pathway is complex that may interconnect and cooperate with other signaling molecules involved in cell survival and proliferation, in particular the core components MST1/2, SAV1, LATS1/2 and the YAP being the targets of key regulators.

4. Regulators connected to MST1/2

MST1 and MST2 (MST1/2) belong to the mammalian sterile 20-like kinase family. They are initially known as the kinases inducing apoptosis in response to pro-apoptotic signals including Fas ligand, TNF-α, serum starvation and ultra-violet exposure [40]. With the discovery of the Hippo pathway as a putative tumor suppressor pathway, MST1/2 is now widely recognized as an upstream regulator of YAP. In mouse models, deletions of MST1/2 in livers attenuated the inhibitory phosphorylation of YAP at Ser-127, causing overgrowths of the liver organ [30,31,41].

The full activation of MST1 and MST2 kinases requires autophosphorylation at Thr-183 and Thr-180, respectively [42,43]. Any tumor suppressors modulating these phosphorylation sites therefore potentially regulate the MST1/2 function. Here we focus our discussion on Ras-association domain family 1 isoform A (RASSF1A) and pleckstrin homology [PH] domain leucine-rich repeat protein phosphatase (PHLPP).

RASSF1A is a tumor suppressor regulating cell cycle and microtubule dynamics [44,45]. Now it has become clear that RASSF1A also regulates the Hippo pathway at MST1/2. In Drosophila, an ortholog of human RASSF (dRASSF) was reported to antagonize Hpo by competing with Sav for binding to Hpo [46]. The binding is mediated by a structural motif called SARAH (Sav/Rassf/Hpo) [47]. In mammalian system, RASSF1A and its related growth inhibitory polypeptide NORE1A (novel Ras effector 1A) also bind MST1 at the homologous SARAH in vivo. RASSF1A directs MST1 to the site of activation [48]. RASSF1A and MST1 co-exist as a complex localizing at microtubules throughout the cell cycle, of which the RASSF1A–MST1 interaction is stimulatory to the MST1 kinase activity [49]. Like the RASSF1A–MST1 complex, the complex formation between RASSF1A and MST2 promotes MST2 activity by enhancing MST2 autophosphorylation [50]. RASSF1A apparently protects MST1/2 against inactivation by PP2A (Fig. 2) [51], the phosphatases that dephosphorylate the stimulatory Thr-183 and Thr-180 of MST1 and MST2, respectively [52]. RASSF1A can also prevent MST2 degradation as evidenced by the finding that knockdown of RASSF1A expression with siRNA lowered MST2 level in vitro [51].

PHLPP enhances MST1 activity by a mechanism distinct from the RASSF1A. Full activation of MST1 requires an activation cleavage that is prevented by the phosphorylation of Thr-387 by AKT [53]. By binding to MST1 at its PP2C domain, PHLPP erases the Thr-387 phosphorylation, freeing MST1 from AKT inhibition (Fig. 2) [54].

Epigenetic silencing of RASSF1A through promoter hypermethylation has been reported in breast [55], lung [56], liver [57], gastric [58], and colorectal cancers [59]. It has also been shown that both MST1/2 activity and RASSF1A are reduced in most HCCs compared to the normal liver tissues [60,61]. On the other hand, PHLPP is also found down-regulated in different cancers [62]. Better understanding the regulation of MST1/2 by RASSF1A and PHLPP should offer much opportunity for new drug development in HCC.

5. Regulators connected to SAV1

Embryonic mortality was observed in SAV1 knockout mice. The embryos showed hyperplasia and inability to terminate differentiation of epithelial progenitor cells [63]. Conditional knockout mice, with liver-specific deletion of SAV1, had increased liver size and eventually developed tumors [30, 64], suggesting a critical tumor suppressive role of SAV1 in the liver. Surprisingly, in these SAV1 deleted tumors, the levels of phospho-YAP or phospho-LATS1/2 were not affected [50]. Therefore, although SAV1 forms complex with MST2 [65], it might not be required for the phosphorylation of LATS1/2 by MST1/2.

One explanation is suggested that SAV1 might not be required for MST1/2 kinase activity in hepatocytes, but rather in other cell types, such as oval cells—the adult liver stem cells, since YAP nuclear translocation was observed in the oval-like cells, but not in the hepatocytes, in the SAV1 –/– mouse liver [64]. Another possible mechanism of SAV1 tumor suppression is mediated by an unknown, hitherto to be identified, Hippo-independent pathway. Indeed, SAV1 has been shown to interact with RASSF1A, and the presence of SAV1 is required for RASSF1A mediated activation of p73. MST1/2 and YAP, on the other hand, appeared not to be required for the activation [66].

6. Regulators connected to MOB1

In human, MOB1A and MOB1B are near identical to each other with protein sequence homology > 90%, and more importantly, both of them are putative tumor suppressors. Early study on Drosophila indicated Mats is essential to regulating apoptosis and cell proliferation [14]. In colorectal cancer, gene and protein expression of MOB1A is reduced in tumors compared to normal colorectal tissues. Under expression of MOB1A is associated with the high incidence of large tumor size, deep invasion, lymphatic permeation and liver metastasis [67]. In HCC, phosphorylation of MOB1 at its Thr12 is frequently diminished [31]. Despite these findings, how MOB1 deficiency contributes to the biology of cancerous tumors deems further investigation.

MST1/2 phosphorylates MOB1 at Thr12 and Thr35. The phospho-MOB1 protein is capable of interacting with various mammalian nuclear Dbf2-related (NDR) kinases (i.e. LATS1/2 and NDR1/2) to regulate cell proliferation [68, 69]. It is generally believed that the phosphorylation on the threonine residues may trigger a conformational change in MOB1, elevating its affinity for the NDR kinases. Interestingly, although LATS1/2 is a downstream target of MST1/2, MST1/2-deficient mouse livers showed deregulation of MOB1A/B and YAP, but not LATS1/2 [31]. The regulation of MOB1 and LATS1/2 by MST1/2 may be organ and disease-specific.

7. Regulators connected to LATS1/2

Most of the LATS1 knockout mice died at their embryonic stages, and for the surviving, many developed soft tissue sarcomas and ovarian stromal cell tumors [70]. The LATS2 knockout mice also exhibited

Fig. 2. Activation of MST1/2 is regulated by RASSF1A and PHLPP. Left panel: Autophosphorylation of MST1 at Thr-183 (Thr-180 of MST2) leads to full activation of the kinase activity. PP2A attenuates MST1/2 activity by dephosphorylating the stimulatory sites. This dephosphorylation is prevented by the binding of RASSF1A to MST1 (and MST2). Right panel: Activated p-Ser-473-AKT phosphorylates MST1 at Thr-387 to suppress MST1 kinase activity. PHLPP antagonizes this inhibition by dephosphorylating the inhibitory site. At the same time, PHLPP is reported able to directly inhibit p-Ser-473-AKT function.

embryonic lethality, and the embryos showed mitotic defects, including failure of cytokinesis and fragmentation of centrosome [71, 72]. Indeed, both LATS1/2 have been implicated in the regulation of mitotic progression by interacting with CDC2 to induce apoptosis and G2/M arrest [71, 73, 74].

The phosphorylation of LATS1/2 is affected by several regulators. In the central axis of Hippo pathway, LATS1 is phosphorylated by MST1/2 at Ser-909 and Thr-1097 (corresponding to Ser-872 and Thr-1041 of LATS2) [65], and the phosphorylation is enhanced by the presence of MOB1 [75]. MOB1 itself could also be phosphorylated by MST1/2 [68]. In addition to these phosphorylation sites, a recent study showed that Ser-380 of LATS2 can be phosphorylated by Aurora A, a regulator of cell division [76]. During mitosis, the Ser-380 phosphorylated LATS2 is localized at the central spindle to regulate the mitotic progression, and MOB1 is involved in this process as well. It is not known, however, if YAP is involved in this mitotic progression control.

KIBRA is another regulator that stabilizes the LATS2 by inhibiting its ubiquitination, and KIBRA overexpression could also promote YAP phosphorylation through LATS1/2 [29]. Interestingly, KIBRA also forms complex with the mitotic kinases Aurora A and Aurora B, and the phosphorylated KIBRA affects cell progression [77]. In this context, LATS1/2 appears as a branching point of the Hippo pathway that receives the cell cycle signal. Whether there is a direct impact on YAP signaling remains however unknown.

LATS1/2 also localizes at the tight junction when interacting with angiomotin [78]. Indeed, angiomotin forms complex with YAP and MST1/2, and co-localizes at the tight junction [78,79]. Angiomotin is thought to act as a scaffold protein that brings the Hippo signaling components in actionable proximity to control cell growth (Fig. 3). Nevertheless, it is still unclear if LATS1/2 is essential for the tumor suppressive function of the Hippo pathway. Although both LATS1 and LATS2 can be phosphorylated and activated by MST1/2 [66], Zhou et al. showed that loss of MST1/2 had no effect on LATS1/2 phosphorylation, and only the YAP phosphorylation was reduced [31]. Another study, however, showed that YAP and LATS1/2 phosphorylation were significantly reduced in the MST1/2 knockout mice [30]. Thus, it is of interest to determine if LATS1/2 is only required in certain cell types or developmental stage of the organ.

At the mRNA level, LATS2 transcripts are regulated by several microRNAs. MiR-372 and miR-373 were reported to exert their oncogenic potentials by targeting LATS2 in testicular germ cell tumors [80]. Other studies confirmed this finding in gastric cancer and esophageal cancer cell lines [81, 82]. miR-31 is another microRNA that targets LATS2, as shown in lung cancer [83]. LATS1 has a different 3′-UTR from the LATS2, implicating different microRNA regulation, but no microRNA regulation of LATS1 has been reported to date.

8. Regulators connected to YAP

The role of YAP is somewhat controversial, as it appears able to act as both oncogene and tumor suppressor, depending on the cellular context. The two WW domains of YAP potentially interact with proteins that have either the inhibitory or promoting roles on cell growth. In MCF10A cells, mutations of YAP WW domains promoted oncogenic properties of the cells, suggesting that it mediates an inhibitory role of YAP in breast epithelia. By contrast, the WW domain mutant YAP had reduced capability to promote oncogenic properties in NIH-3T3 cells [84]. The results showed that WW domains of YAP indeed have cell-specific regulatory roles, and depend on the interacting partners.

The YAP WW domain can interact with p73 to achieve a pro-apoptotic function [85]. Upon binding with p73, YAP can up-regulate Bax expression and promote cell death [86]. YAP is also known as an oncogene in many kinds of solid cancers, such as hepatocellular carcinoma [30,34,87,88], ovarian cancer [78] and oral squamous cell carcinoma [90]. Its activity is regulated by phosphorylation-induced subcellular distribution and degradation. At high cell density, YAP is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 at Ser-127 in the WW domain—as a consequence of Hippo pathway activation [10, 91]. This creates a binding cleft for 14-3-3 protein, and the binding between YAP and 14-3-3 proteins promotes cytoplasmic retention of YAP. LATS1/2 also phosphorylates YAP at Ser-381 that leads to subsequent phosphorylation of YAP at Ser-384 and Ser-387 by CK 1δ/ε. This cascade of phosphorylation creates a recognition site for the E3-ligase and SCFβ-TRCP, resulting in YAP ubiquitination. The mechanism has been suggested as a long-term control of YAP activity [92] (Fig. 4).

α-Catenin is a structural linker between cadherin/catenin complex and the actin cytoskeleton. Recently, it is evident that α-catenin also has a role in signaling transduction. In skin cells, α-catenin was demonstrated able to bind to 14-3-3 protein and to stabilize its interaction

Fig. 3. The Hippo–LATS1/2 is regulated by at least three different mechanisms. Left panel: Activation of Hippo signaling leads to LATS1 phosphorylation at Ser-909 and Thr-1097 (corresponding to Ser-872 and Thr-1041 of LATS2). SAV1, as an adaptor protein, couples the phosphorylation from MST1/2 to LATS1/2 and stimulates their phosphorylation. RASSF1A also interacts directly with both MST1/2 and SAV1 and affects YAP activity. Middle panel: Aurora A, a regulator of cell division, phosphorylates LATS2 at Ser-380 during mitosis, which modulates Aurora B activity through LATS1. Another cell cycle regulator, CDC2, also associates with LATS1 during mitosis, and the phosphorylation of Ser-909 is required for the apoptosis. Right panel: Angiomotin, a tight-junction protein, is an activator of LATS2. Angiomotin is also able to interact with YAP and promote YAP phosphorylation. The Hippo pathway components, MST2, LATS2, and YAP, and angiomin are found co-localized at tight junctions.

with Ser-127 phosphorylated YAP, preventing YAP from dephosphorylation in the context of high cell density. The YAP WW domains are required for the efficient interaction with α-catenin [93]. Loss of α-catenin has been reported in many cancer types, and was prognostic to poorer survival in certain malignancies [94].

### 8.1. YAP and tight junction

Several tight-junction related proteins have been identified as regulators of YAP oncogenic activities. Angiomotin, which is involved in tight junction integrity and its family members include AMOT,

Fig. 4. The transcriptional function of YAP is regulated by phosphorylation, cellular localization, and ubiquitination. YAP is phosphorylated by LATS1/2 at Ser-127, which creates a binding cleft for 14-3-3 protein. α-Catenin can bind to the YAP-14-3-3 complex, and stabilizes the phosphorylation status of YAP. The Ser-127 phosphorylated YAP might be further phosphorylated at Ser-381 by LATS1/2, which leads to subsequent phosphorylation by CK 1δ/ε at Ser-384 and Ser-387. This cascade of phosphorylation allows the binding of SCFβ-TRCP that promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of YAP. When YAP is in a de-phosphorylated form, it could be recruited by angiomin and localized at tight junction. YAP may also bind to ZO-2, which aids the translocation of YAP into nucleus. In the nucleus, YAP binds to various transcription factors, such as TEA domain family transcription factors (TEADs). In response to TGF-β or BMP signals, receptor mediated SMADs (R-SMADs) are phosphorylated (TGF-β receptors act on SMAD2 and SMAD3, and BMP receptors act on SMAD1, SMAD5, and SMAD8). YAP binds to the phosphorylated SMAD1 to activate gene transcription. YAP also cross talks with Wnt signaling by interacting with β-catenin transcriptional complex.

A.M. Liu et al. / Biochimica et Biophysica Acta 1826 (2012) 357–364

AMOTL1 and AMOTL2, was recently shown to bind to YAP, LATS2 and MST2. It functions as a scaffold protein to facilitate the activation of Hippo pathway [78, 95, 80]. The WW domain of YAP and the PY motif of AMOT mediate the binding that is important for tight junction localization and phosphorylation of YAP, thus forming as an integral component of the Hippo pathway [95, 80].

ZO-2 (zona occluden-2) is another tight junction protein that regulates YAP. ZO-2 can shuttle between cytoplasm and nucleus. It has both nuclear localization and export signals (NLS and NES) while YAP has neither properties. The YAP–ZO-2 interaction is therefore believed to play a role for the shuttling of YAP between nuclear and cytosolic compartments [96, 97]. It has been observed that ZO-2 is predominantly present in sparse proliferating cells, and almost no nuclear ZO-2 staining detected when cells grow to confluent and quiescent states [98]. It is also reported that ZO-2 enters the nucleus at the late G1 phase and leaves the nucleus during mitosis [99]. However, different from angiomin, the binding of ZO-2 promotes nuclear localization of YAP and promotes its pro-apoptotic function under stressed conditions, such as UV light or low-serum media [100].

Recently, there is an interesting finding that demonstrates that the phosphorylation level of YAP is regulated by cell morphology and stress fiber F-actin on a single cell level. Whether this regulation is dependent or independent on canonical Hippo pathway or any tight junction components is subjected to full investigation [101, 102].

### 8.2. Transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of YAP

Transcription factor of YAP has not been extensively studied. The promoter of YAP contains an AP-1 binding site, a c-Jun recognition site, and a report showed that c-Jun and YAP mRNA levels are tightly correlated [103], although more studies are necessary to demonstrate the direct binding of the transcription factors to YAP promoter.

miR-375, a microRNA down-regulated in HCC, has been observed to suppress the expression of YAP, and over-expression of miR-375 could suppress tumorigenic properties of HCC cells [104]. The negative correlated expression of YAP and miR-375 was also observed in lung cancer lines [105]. This observation is further evidenced in a chemically induced HCC mouse model that an increased level of YAP was associated with the down-regulation of miR-375 [87]. Collectively, the data strongly support that miR-375 could affect both the mRNA and protein level of YAP, implicating as a potential therapeutic agent targeting YAP oncogene in HCC and lung cancer.

### 8.3. Crosstalk of YAP with different signaling pathways

YAP interacts with various binding partners to mediate transcription of genes. In the developing fetal heart in mice, Hippo signaling was shown to regulate a subset of Wnt target genes. Further experiments showed that YAP and β-catenin interacted in nucleus. Together they regulate expression of genes such as Sox2 and Snai2 [106]. Wnt signaling pathway is commonly deregulated in HCC, and thus would be worthwhile to study if YAP is involved in Wnt pathway signaling in liver and HCC.

Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) signaling has recently been shown to associate with Hippo pathway through targeting YAP. In response to stimulation of TGF-β or bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligands, SMAD mediates signals received from the heteromeric serine/threonine kinase receptor complexes. The interaction between YAP and SMAD has been identified for some time [107]. Recently, it was found that when TGF-β pathway is activated, YAP can specifically recognize the phosphorylated SMAD linker sequence containing the PY motif, and its presence is required for efficient transcription of BMP target genes [108]. Later, another study showed that different localization of YAP in response to cell density could affect the localization of active SMAD complexes, resulting in an altered cell response to BMP or TGF-β stimulation [109]. Structural analysis

indeed showed a direct binding of phosphorylated SMAD and the WW domain of YAP, in which the SMAD phosphorylation is mediated by CDK8/9 in response to the BMP signal [110].

## 9. Conclusion and future perspectives

Hippo pathway is a prominent tumor suppressor pathway frequently dysregulated in human cancers, particularly in liver and lung cancers. The dysregulation is caused by the aberrant expression of the pathway components, and/or the alterations in the pathway regulators and interconnected signaling pathways that were discussed. It is now realized that the Hippo core kinases MST1/2 and LATS1/2 are largely regulated by phosphorylation on their regulatory sites. The pathway effector YAP is mainly modulated by its binding partners (e.g. angiomin) that govern YAP localization between cytoplasm and the nucleus. How these regulations are altered in cancers remains to be unequivocally defined. Nevertheless, it becomes clear that some of the key pathway regulators are tumor suppressors (e.g. RASSF1A activating MST1/2) that are frequently silenced in cancers by hypermethylation on their gene promoters. Administration of DNA methylation inhibitor like 5-aza-2-deoxycytidine could reduce tumor growth by restoring RASSF1A expression in mouse xenograft model of lung cancer [111]. This has opened a new avenue to examine if such agents can reactivate the attenuated Hippo core kinases in cancers.

Somatic mutations on tumor suppressors and oncogenes are implicated in cancer development. A recent study on a lung cancer patient showed that multiple mutations along the EGFR–RAS–RAF–MEK–ERK pathway would co-operate with each other to drive the constitutive pro-growth signaling [112]. Sav1 gene was found mutated in cell lines of colon and renal cancers [5]. Mutational attenuation of the entire Hippo pathway has not been characterized yet. However, with the recent advent of next-generation sequencing like whole-genome, exome and deep RNA sequencings [113], the structural variants of the pathway components will be gradually unveiled. Integrated analysis of pathway regulators, interconnected signaling, and mutational data of Hippo pathway will ultimately provide us an unprecedented and comprehensive survey at the Hippo pathway deregulation in cancers, yielding novel and tractable targets for cancer treatment.
