## Summary

The bacterium *Burkholderia glumae* causes rice grain rot by producing toxoflavin, whose expression is regulated by quorum sensing (QS). We report a major deviation from the current paradigm for the regulation of bacterial polar flagellum genes. The N-octanoyl homoserine lactone (C8-HSL)-deficient mutant of *B. glumae* is aflagellate and has lost the ability to swim and swarm at 37°C. Mutagenesis of the bacterium with the mini-Tn5rescue identified an IclR-type transcriptional regulator, called QsmR, which is important for flagellum formation. TofR, which is a cognate C8-HSL receptor, activated *qsmR* expression by binding directly to the *qsmR* promoter region. From the flagellum gene cluster, we identified *flhDC* homologues that are directly activated by QsmR. FlhDC in turn activates the expression of genes involved in flagellum biosynthesis, motor functions and chemotaxis in *B. glumae*. Non-motile *qsmR*, *fliA* and *flhDC* mutants produced toxoflavin, but lost pathogenicity for rice. The unexpected discovery of FlhDC in a polarly flagellate bacterium suggests that exceptions to the typical regulatory mechanisms of flagellum genes exist in Gram-negative bacteria. The finding that functional flagella play critical roles in the pathogenicity of *B. glumae* suggests that either QS or flagellum formation constitutes a good target for the control of rice grain rot.

## Introduction

Bacteria respond to environmental stimuli and possess flagella that direct movement through a liquid (swimming) or over a surface as a biofilm (swarming) (Harshey, 1994; Moens and Vanderleyden, 1996). Bacterial flagella are very complex organelles that allow bacteria to reach appropriate niches for survival in the environment. Bacterial movement driven by flagella is important for pathogenic bacteria, in that it allows them to arrive at the infection site in a potential host and confers a significant selection advantage during the initial establishment phases of the infection (Characklis, 1990; Davey and O’Toole, 2000). Indeed, the roles of flagella in virulence have been demonstrated for numerous human- and plant-pathogenic bacteria (Bayot and Ries, 1986; Hatterman and Ries, 1989; Ritchings *et al.*, 1995; Gardel and Mekalanos, 1996; Chesnokova *et al.*, 1997; Otteman and Miller, 1997; Tans-Kersten *et al.*, 2001).

Because flagellum biogenesis and cell movement are energetically expensive processes, bacteria use hierarchical regulatory networks to conserve energy and to control the ordered expression of the individual components of the flagellar organelle (Aldridge and Hughes, 2002). Flagellum gene regulation can be categorized into two distinct groups based on the master regulators. In general, lateral (peritrichous) flagellum systems, which are typical of the Enterobacteriaceae, use FlhDC as the master transcriptional regulator to activate the expression of flagellum genes (Macnab, 1996; Kutsukake, 1997; Soutourina *et al.*, 1999; Aldridge and Hughes, 2002). Polar flagellum systems, which are typically found in Pseudomonadaceae and Vibrionaceae, use the σ⁵⁴-dependent NtrC family of transcriptional activators for flagellum gene expression (Ritchings *et al.*, 1995; Arora *et al.*, 1997).

Many bacterial behaviours are known to be regulated in the cell density-dependent manner of quorum sensing (QS) (Fuqua *et al.*, 1996; Miller and Bassler, 2001; Whitehead *et al.*, 2001). As mediators of cell density-dependent communication, N-acyl homoserine lactones (AHLs) are widespread among Gram-negative bacteria, while 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4(1H)-quinolone and autoinducer-2 (4,5-dihydroxy-2,3-pentanedione), which are converted into a variety of extracellular molecules, as well as the chemically uncharacterized autoinducer-3, have been

discovered in *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, *Vibrio harveyi* and enterohemorrhagic *Escherichia coli* (EHEC) O157:H7 respectively (Engebrecht et al., 1983; Davies et al., 1998; Pesci et al., 1999; Sperandio et al., 2003). Recently, it has been reported that *Pseudomonas putida* and *Burkholderia* species, including *B. pseudomallei*, *B. thailandensis* and *B. cenocepacia*, produce 2-heptyl-4(1H)-quinolone (Diggle et al., 2006). This indicates that quinolone signalling molecules may be used for intergenus communication. AHLs differ with respect to the length, degree of saturation, and substitution of the side-chain, and bind to their cognate receptor LuxR-type transcription factors, thereby converting them to the active form of the dimer, which regulates sets of genes (Engebrecht et al., 1983; Engebrecht and Silverman, 1984; Davies et al., 1998).

Among the many different bacterial phenotypes, swarming motilities are often regulated by QS. In many swarming bacteria, which include *P. aeruginosa*, *Serratia liquefaciens*, *Serratia marcescens* and *Burkholderia cepacia*, important roles in surface migration are played by a biosurfactant, the production of which is regulated by QS (Daniels et al., 2004). The loss of swarming motility seen for an AHL-deficient mutant of *S. liquefaciens* is due to the lack of biosurfactant production rather than the absence of flagellum formation (Eberl et al., 1999; Daniels et al., 2004). However, there are two lines of evidence that QS directly regulates the genes for flagellum biosynthesis: (i) the QseB/QseC two-component regulatory system of *E. coli*, which is controlled by QS, regulates flagellum gene expression in *E. coli* (Sperandio et al., 2002; Daniels et al., 2004; Clarke et al., 2006); and (ii) QS controls the swimming and swarming motility of *Yersinia enterocolitica* and flagellar synthesis is delayed in a QS mutant (Atkinson et al., 2006).

Our interest in studying flagellum biogenesis and the motility of *Burkholderia glumae* relates to the fact that this bacterium infects rice flowers and causes rice grain rot (Tsushima et al., 1995). Crop yield reductions as a result of rice infection are very severe under favourable weather conditions (Tsushima et al., 1985; 1995). Previously, we have reported that the phytotoxin toxoflavin is a major virulence factor, and that the expression of genes involved in the biosynthesis and transport of toxoflavin is regulated by *N*-octanoyl homoserine lactone (C8-HSL), which is biosynthesized by TofI and its cognate receptor TofR (Kim et al., 2004).

We hypothesized that *B. glumae* motility towards infection sites in rice flowers might be critical for pathogenicity. Therefore, we investigated how QS controls flagellum formation in *B. glumae* and how motility affects the pathogenicity of this bacterium. We show that C8-HSL-deficient mutants of *B. glumae* lack flagella, and consequently, they have lost swimming and swarming motilities and

virulence. Here we report the novel observation that a polarly flagellate bacterium expresses the master regulator for lateral flagella, FlhDC, the gene expression of which is activated by QS and a previously unknown flagellum gene regulator that shares similarity with the IclR-type transcriptional regulators.

### Results

#### Quorum sensing-defective mutants are aflagellate at 37°C

To determine whether QS is involved in *B. glumae* flagellum formation, we tested the swimming and swarming motilities of the wild-type strain BGR1 and the *tofI* mutant strain, which lacks C8-HSL biosynthesis (Kim et al., 2004). The wild-type strain BGR1 exhibited swimming and swarming motilities, whereas the *tofI::Ω* mutant strain BGS2 showed no swarming motility and significantly reduced swimming motility at 37°C (Figs 1A and S1). However, the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 at 28°C exhibited swimming motility but no swarming motility (Fig. 1B). The swimming and swarming motilities of the *tofI* mutant strain were recovered by the addition of 1 μM C8-HSL to the LB agar plates at 37°C (Fig. 1A). However, exogenous addition of 1 μM of C4-HSL, C6-HSL, C12-HSL, 3-oxo-C6-HSL or 3-oxo-C8-HSL to the assay plates failed to recover the swimming and swarming motilities, and 1 μM C10-HSL restored the swarming activity to a slight degree (Fig. S2).

To determine whether the loss of the swimming and swarming motilities of the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 was due to non-functional or impaired flagella formation, we examined the wild-type strain BGR1 and the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Typical dual polar flagella were observed for the wild-type strain BGR1 and the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 at 28°C. Although no flagella were observed for the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 at 37°C, this deficiency was compensated by the addition of 1 μM C8-HSL (Fig. 1). This indicates that flagellum formation is under the control of QS at 37°C, and that the loss of swimming and swarming motilities shown by the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 is due to lack of flagellum formation at 37°C.

#### Identification of a novel flagellar gene regulon

By assaying the swimming and swarming motilities of mutants generated by mini-Tn5rescue mutagenesis of the wild-type strain BGR1, we isolated the RT516 mutant strain, which exhibited no swarming motility and significantly reduced swimming motility at 37°C (Fig. 2A). When the rescued clone that carried the mini-Tn5rescue from the RT516 mutant strain was reintroduced into wild-type

strain BGR1 by marker exchange, the phenotype of the newly generated mutant was the same as that of the RT516 mutant strain. The cosmid clone pBGF6, which covers the region flanking the mini-Tn5rescue in the RT516 mutant strain, was mutagenized with Tn3-gusA to obtain an insertion mutation in the same locus as the mini-Tn5rescue that was inserted in the RT516 mutant strain (Table 1 and Fig. 3). The Tn3-gusA30 insertion mutant exhibited the same phenotype as the RT516 mutant strain (Fig. 2A). DNA sequence analysis of the region flanking the Tn3-gusA30 insertion site identified one possible open reading frame (ORF), termed qsmR (quorum sensing master regulator) (GenBank Accession No. DQ987829). The 828 bp gene putatively encodes a 29.7 kDa protein, which shows 93% identity to IclR of E. coli (Fig. 3). QsmR contains a typical helix-turn-helix

Swimming motility or swarming motility is observed for the wild-type strain BGR1, but these parameters are significantly reduced for the *tofl* mutant strain BGS2 at 37°C. Although no swarming activity is observed for *tofl* mutant strain BGS2, swimming motility is maintained at 28°C. The swimming and swarming motilities of *tofl* mutant strain BGS2 are recovered by the addition of 1 μM C8-HSL to the LB agar plates. Typical dual polar flagella are observed for the wild-type strain BGR1 and *tofl* mutant strain BGS2 grown in medium supplemented with 1 μM C8-HSL, whereas no flagella are observed for the *tofl* mutant strain BGS2 grown at 37°C.

lower than in the wild-type (Fig. 4B). No significant amounts of toxoflavin or C8-HSL were detected for the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 (Fig. 4).

TofR/C8-HSL activates *qsmR* expression

As the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 exhibited the same phenotype of swimming and swarming activities as the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2, we investigated whether the expression of *qsmR* was affected by QS. The expression of *qsmR* was upregulated in the wild-type strain BGR1 and *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 supplemented with 1 μM C8-HSL, relative to the *tofI* mutant strain BGS2 and BGS2 supplemented with C6-HSL, respectively, which indicates that *qsmR* expression is activated by TofR/C8-HSL (Fig. 5A). TofR/C8-HSL binding to the promoter region of *qsmR*, as shown by electrophoresis mobility shift assay, confirms that the expression of *qsmR* is directly activated by TofR/C8-HSL (Fig. 5B).

gusA30 insertion mutants (Fig. 2A). The *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 exhibited no swarming motilities at 28°C and 37°C, whereas the mutant exhibited swimming motility at 28°C but not at 37°C (Fig. 2). The swimming and swarming motilities of BGR9 at 37°C were recovered by complementing the mutant with a plasmid that carries *qsmR* (Fig. 2A).

To determine whether QsmR is involved in *B. glumae* QS, we extracted C8-HSL and toxoflavin from the *qsmR* mutant strain grown in liquid medium or on agar plates for 8–20 h at 37°C. The *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 produced C8-HSL to the same degree as the wild-type strain BGR1 after 12 h and produced lower amounts compared with the wild-type after 16 h in LB liquid culture (Fig. 4A). Toxoflavin production by the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 increased after 12 h but decreased after 16 h in liquid culture (Fig. 4A). On the solid agar medium, the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 produced toxoflavin to the same degree as the wild-type did, but C8-HSL production was

**Fig. 4.** Toxoflavin and C8-HSL production of the *tofI* mutant and *qsmR* mutant strains in LB liquid medium (A) or on LB agar medium (B). The *tofI* mutant BGS2 strain does not produce any C8-HSL or toxoflavin in liquid culture or on solid medium. The *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 produces C8-HSL, the level of which is decreased after 16 h in liquid culture. Toxoflavin production by the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 increases after 12 h in liquid culture and then decreases after 16 h in liquid culture. On the solid agar medium, the levels of C8-HSL and toxoflavin production by the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 are not decreased. Bars indicate C8-HSL production and lines indicate toxoflavin production. Vertical lines indicate the standard deviations for three independent assays.

Tn3-gusA, each mutation was marker-exchanged into the wild-type strain BGR1. Mutations in the *fli* and *flh* genes abolished swarming and swimming motilities, although the *fliC::Tn3-gusA49* mutant retained both motilities (Fig. 6). The *che* and *tsr* mutants retained swarming motility but lost swimming activity (Fig. 6). A mutation in the *motA* gene (*motA::Tn3-gusA32*) conferred diminished swarming motility but no swimming activity (Fig. 6). To correlate the swarming and swimming motilities with flagellum formation, we examined each Tn3-gusA mutant under TEM. The loss of swimming activity in the mutants was due to a lack of flagellum formation, with the exception of the *cheB::Tn3-gusA43*, *cheZ::Tn3-gusA48*, *motA::Tn3-gusA32*, and *tsr::Tn3-gusA180* mutants (Fig. 6). The *fliC* mutant possessed normal flagella (Fig. 6).

We examined each of the mutant strains grown in liquid culture at 37°C under a light microscope to see whether a fraction of the bacterial population was swimming. Cells of the wild-type strain BGR1 were motile, whereas all of the *tofI*, *qsmR*, *fliA*, and *flhD* mutant strains were non-motile. Large proportions of the bacterial populations of the *fliC*, *tsr*, and *cheZ* mutant strains were motile, whereas only a few bacterial cells of the *motA* mutant strain showed motility.

### Multiple copies of the *fliC* gene

Because the *fliC::Tn3-gusA49* mutant was motile and retained a polar flagellum (Fig. 6), we determined the number of copies of *fliC* in the *B. glumae* genome. We found five *fliC* gene homologues in the chromosome (Fig. S3).

### QsmR activates the expression of FlhDC

To determine whether QsmR regulates *flhDC* expression, we constructed *flhC::Tn3-gusA41* mutants in the wild-type strain BGR1 and the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9. The expression of *flhC* was abolished in *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 but was recovered by complementing the mutant with a plasmid that carried *qsmR*, which indicates that QsmR activates *flhC* expression (Fig. 7A). Furthermore, QsmR bound to the promoter region of *flhDC*, which supports the notion of direct activation of *flhDC* expression by QsmR (Fig. 7B).

To demonstrate that FlhDC regulates the expression of other flagellar genes, we measured the β-glucuronidase activities of the *fliA::Tn3-gusA45*, *fliC::Tn3-gusA49*, *tsr::Tn3-gusA180*, and *motA::Tn3-gusA32* mutants in the wild-type strain BGR1 and in the *flhD::Ω* mutant strain BGS7. The expression levels of *fliA*, *fliC*, *tsr*, and *motA* were decreased in the *flhD* mutant strain BGS7, as compared with the corresponding expression levels in

### Identification of *flhDC* and other flagellar genes

To isolate cosmid clones that encompass the *B. glumae* genes for flagellum formation, a 390 bp fragment of the *cheA* gene was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the chromosomal DNA of *E. coli* DH5α as template DNA and the CheA1 (5′-ATGGCGGATAAAGAACTT-3′) and CheA1R (5′-TCACATGCCCAAGTTT-3′) primers, and the amplified *cheA* fragment was used as the probe in colony hybridization. Two overlapping clones, pBGF2 and pBGF3, were isolated. To characterize further the regulatory cascades for genes involved in flagellum formation in *B. glumae*, we sequenced the insert DNA fragments present in pBGF2 and pBGF3. For the derived sequences, we identified 20 ORFs with similarities to genes involved in flagellum biosynthesis, motility, chemoreception, and chemotaxis in *E. coli* and *B. pseudomallei* (Fig. 6 and Table S1; GenBank Accession Nos DQ996270 and DQ996271). We also identified the *flhD* and *flhC* genes, the products of which are known to comprise the master regulator for lateral flagellum systems upstream of *motA* (Fig. 6). The FlhD and FlhC homologues showed 83% and 85% similarity to *E. coli* FlhD and FlhC respectively (Table S1).

wild-type strain BGR1 (Fig. 7A). These results indicate that QsmR activates the expression of flagellar genes by upregulating *flhDC* expression.

**Motility and chemotaxis are important for pathogenicity**

To evaluate the abilities of the non-swimming mutants to induce bacterial grain rot in rice, the wild-type strain BGR1 and the non-swimming mutants were inoculated into rice panicles at the flowering stage. The flagellum-deficient *flhD*, *qsmR* and *fliA* mutants, as well as other non-swimming mutants, including the *cheZ::Tn3-gusA48* mutant, produced toxoflavin but failed to cause bacterial grain rot, whereas the wild-type strain BGR1 caused severe symptoms (representative assays are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. S4). The *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 with *qsmR* on a plasmid showed restored pathogenicity (Fig. 8). These results indicate that flagellum formation and swimming motility are essential for *B. glumae* infectivity for rice panicles.

**Discussion**

We report variations to the current paradigm of polar flagellum gene regulation. According to the current paradigm, transcriptional hierarchies within the same flagellar type are conserved, while the master regulators of polar flagellum systems vary somewhat (Ritchings et al., 1995; Macnab, 1996; Arora et al., 1997; Kutsukake, 1997; Soutourina et al., 1999; Aldridge and Hughes, 2002). Among non-enteric bacteria, the system in *Sinorhizobium meliloti* is considered most similar to the three-tiered enteric transcriptional cascades (Sourjik et al., 2000). However, the flagellar regulation cascade of *S. meliloti* is controlled by the two LuxR-type regulators rather than by FlhDC (Sourjik et al., 2000). The current finding that FlhDC in a polarly flagellate bacterium regulates other flagellar genes is unusual, in that it is known that lateral flagellum systems use FlhDC as a master regulator (Soutourina and Bertin, 2003; Daniels et al., 2004; McCarter, 2006). Indeed, the *flhDC* genes have been

describe the functional role of FlhDC as a regulator of a polarly flagellated bacterium. The expression of the $\sigma^{70}$-dependent $flhDC$ operon is controlled by numerous environmental cues besides QS, including temperature, osmolarity, pH and global regulatory proteins, such as H-NS and the cAMP–CAP complex (Adler and Templeton, 1967; Yokota and Gots, 1970; Bertin et al., 1994; Shin and Park, 1995). Moreover, small RNAs control the stability of $flhDC$ mRNA in *E. coli* (Wei et al., 2001; Soutourina and Bertin, 2003).

In the hierarchical gene regulation of *B. glumae* flagella, we identified QsmR, which is an IclR-type transcriptional regulator. QsmR is the first example of a QS-regulated IclR-type regulator. Furthermore, because QsmR regulates $flhDC$ expression, it represents a novel flagellar regulon controlled by QS. The IclR-type regulators can act as activators or repressors or they can have dual functions, and they often require effector molecules for activity (Molina-Henares et al., 2006). QsmR is an activator of $flhDC$ expression. However, the current data do not indicate whether QsmR has dual functions or requires effector molecules. In EHEC, QseC is a sensor kinase and QseB binds to two sites in the promoter region of $flhDC$ depending upon phosphorylation (Sperandio et al., 2002; Daniels et al., 2004; Clarke et al., 2006). However, in the present study, it is not clear if QsmR requires post-translational modification to bind to the $flhDC$ promoter.

Flagellar gene regulation mediated by QS in *B. glumae* is somewhat similar to that in EHEC in the sense that QS regulates a transcriptional regulator whose gene product directly activates $flhDC$ expression (Sperandio et al., 2002). However, the two systems produce different types of flagella and use different signal molecules and different

The expression of $flhC$ is abolished in the $qsmR$ mutant strain BGS9 but is recovered by complementation with a plasmid that carries $qsmR$. The expression levels of $fliA$, $fliC$, $tsr$ and $motA$ are decreased in the $flhD$ mutant strain BGS7 and in $qsmR$ mutant strain BGS9 but are increased to wild-type levels by complementation with pBGT63, which carries $qsmR$.

types of regulator to activate $flhDC$ expression. As the QS signal molecule, EHEC uses the AI-3 QS molecule, while $B$. glumae uses C8-HSL (Sperandio et al., 2002; Clarke et al., 2006). EHEC uses QseB, which is a response regulator of two-component systems, whereas $B$. glumae uses the IclR-type regulator QsmR to activate $flhDC$ expression. Moreover, the expression of $flhDC$ depends on FliA ($\sigma^{28}$) in $E$. coli (Sperandio et al., 2002).

A mutation in the $qseC$ gene of EHEC resulted in diminished motility and considerably lower flagellin production, as assessed by Western blot analysis using FliC antibodies (Sperandio et al., 2002). However, it is not clear whether this reduced production of flagellin affects flagellum formation, as TEM pictures of the $qseC$ mutant are not available. Because a mutation in $qsmR$ abolished flagellum formation and motility in $B$. glumae at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, we believe that QsmR regulates the expression of $flhDC$ more stringently than QseB regulates in EHEC. It has been reported that QseBC plays no role in the regulation of the other QS-regulated phenotypes in EHEC (Sperandio et al., 2002; Daniels et al., 2004). Because the $qsmR$ mutant strain exhibits lower production of QS signal molecule and a reduced level of toxoflavin in liquid medium, it is thought that QsmR may be involved in the gene regulation of QS signal and toxoflavin degradation. Similar QS signal degradation has been reported in Agrobacterium tumefaciens (Zhang et al., 2002).

The involvement of QS in swimming and swarming motilities and biofilm formation has been studied in Burkholderia species. The swarming motility of $B$. cepacia is known to be regulated by QS, probably through the control of biosurfactant production (Huber et al., 2001). Biofilm formation by $B$. cepacia requires a functional QS system, although the swimming activity of the QS-deficient mutant is not affected (Huber et al., 2001). Thus, the loss of swarming motility of the QS-deficient mutant of $B$. cepacia may be due to a lack of biosurfactant production rather than loss of flagellum formation. The roles of QS in swimming and swarming motilities appear to differ in $B$. glumae and $B$. cepacia, because the loss of motility observed for the $B$. glumae QS-deficient mutant was mainly due to the lack of polar flagellum formation. Nonetheless, it is possible that the swarming motility of $B$. glumae is also affected by biosurfactants, as observed for $B$. cepacia. Mature biofilm formation by $B$. glumae has not been investigated previously and is a subject for future studies.

Environmental factors, such as temperature, appear to be very critical for the swimming activity of $B$. glumae. The QS-deficient mutant BGS2 exhibited swimming activity and retained normal flagella at $28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but lost swarming activity. On the other hand, the QS-deficient mutant BGS2 was aflagellate at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, thereby losing swimming activity even after 32 h. This indicates that flagellum formation is not controlled by QS at $28^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ but is tightly regulated by QS at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Furthermore, these results indicate that the aflagellate phenotype of the QS-deficient mutant BGS2 is not due to delayed expression of flagellar gene expression at $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The very weak swimming-like activity of the QS-deficient mutant BGS2 is believed to be mediated by bacterial fimbriae.

Cells of the QS-deficient mutant strain BGS2 appeared to be smaller than the wild-type cells. Currently, we do not have an explanation for this phenotype. Because the growth rate of the QS-deficient mutant strain BGS2 was very similar to that of the wild-type strain BGR1 (data not shown), the smaller size of the mutant strain BGS2 was not due to a difference in growth stage. The QS-deficient mutant strain BGS2 neither clumped nor settled to the bottom of the culture tube.

The $fliC$ gene encodes a flagellar subunit, flagellin, such that the $fliC$ mutants of other bacteria are non-motile (Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994; Shimizu et al., 2003). However, the $fliC$ mutant of $B$. glumae retained normal flagella and exhibited swimming and swarming motilities. This phenotype of the $fliC$ mutant was due to the presence of multiple copies of the $fliC$ gene in the genome of $B$. glumae. Unlike $B$. glumae, $B$. cepacia, $B$. mallei, and $B$. pseudomallei have a single $fliC$ gene (Hales et al., 1998; Chua et al., 2003; Holden et al., 2004). A similar phenomenon has been observed for Vibrio parahaemolyticus, which possesses six flagellin genes (McCarter, 1995). In $V$. parahaemolyticus, the loss of function of a single flagellin gene has little or no effect on swimming motility or flagellar structure. In addition, deletion of the $flaFBA$ or $flaCD$ genes has little effect on motility, whereas the deletion of both loci ($\Delta flaFBA \Delta flaCD$) completely abolishes motility (McCarter, 1995).

The phenotypes of the chemotaxis-related mutants of $B$. glumae were different from those of the corresponding $E$. coli mutants. A mutation in $cheY$, $cheA$, $cheB$ or $cheZ$ in $E$. coli abolishes swarming motility (Harshey and Matsuyama, 1994), whereas the $cheB$ or $cheA$ mutant of $B$. glumae retains swarming activity and normal flagella but loses swimming motility. Therefore, the swarming motility of $B$. glumae appears to be dependent upon flagella, while swimming motility requires functional flagella and chemotaxis systems. When the $cheZ$ mutant was viewed under a light microscope, large proportions of the bacterial population were motile (data not shown) but they failed to spread in the LB agar swimming assay plate. Therefore, the current study indicates that toxoflavin is not sufficient for grain rot to occur, because bacterial flagellar motility and chemotaxis appear to be required for the bacteria to infect plant tissues efficiently.

Fig. 9. Schematic of flagellum gene regulation in *B. glumae*. Quorum sensing activates *qsmR* transcription, which in turn activates the transcription of the *flhDC* genes. FlhDC activates the transcription of the flagellum genes in a cascade fashion. Open and filled diamonds indicate the inactive and active forms of TofR respectively; + denotes gene activation. The oval represents a bacterial cell.

The bacterium most likely regulates flagellum genes on multiple levels to conserve energy and to promote the transition between different bacterial developmental phases, with different flagella serving defined biological functions. As bacterial flagellation consumes large amounts of energy (Macnab, 1996), *B. glumae* cells must reach a critical cell density before they start to flagellate. Such regulation systems enhance the efficiency with which niches are colonized by increasing motility so as to facilitate dispersal once one region becomes fully colonized. By combining the genetic organization and regulation circuits of flagellar genes, we have devised a working model of how *B. glumae* cells regulate flagellum genes (Fig. 9).

The flagellum is an important organelle of motility in bacteria and plays a key role in many bacterial lifestyles, including virulence (Josenhans and Suerbaum, 2002; Pallen et al., 2005). In plant-pathogenic bacteria, there are several reports that non-motile mutants of *A. tumefaciens*, *Erwinia amylovora*, *Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *glycinea* and *Ralstonia solanacearum* show loss of virulence (Bayot and Ries, 1986; Hatterman and Ries, 1989; Ritchings et al., 1995; Gardel and Mekalanos, 1996; Chesnokova et al., 1997; Otteman and Miller, 1997; Tans-Kersten et al., 2001). Because the spikelets of rice plants at flowering are highly susceptible to invasion (Tsushima et al., 1995), it is presumed that *B. glumae* moves towards the infection site and colonizes the inner surface of rice spikelets. When a plant-pathogenic bacterium, such as *B. glumae*, infects plant flowers, bacterial motility and chemotactic movement play critical roles in the initial entry into the infection site. The fact that QS regulates both flagellum formation and toxoflavin production provides a potential target for the control of rice grain rot.

### Experimental procedures

#### Bacterial strains, plasmids, media and AHLs

All of the *B. glumae* strains used are derivatives of the wild-type strain BGR1; the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains of *E. coli* and *B. glumae* were grown at 37°C in L broth (LB) or LB that contained 1.5% agar. Antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: ampicillin, 100 µg ml⁻¹; chloramphenicol, 34 µg ml⁻¹; gentamycin, 50 µg ml⁻¹; kanamycin, 50 µg ml⁻¹; nalidixic acid, 20 µg ml⁻¹; rifampicin, 100 µg ml⁻¹; spectinomycin, 25 µg ml⁻¹; and tetracycline, 10 µg ml⁻¹. The AHLs used in this study were synthesized as described previously (Zhang et al., 1993).

#### DNA manipulation and sequencing

All basic DNA manipulations were performed as described by Sambrook et al. (1989). The construction of the genomic library of the wild-type strain BGR1 has been described previously (Kim et al., 2004). Small-scale plasmid DNA isolation from *E. coli* was performed using either QIAprep Spin (Qiagen) according to the supplier's instructions or the alkaline lysis method. Small-scale cosmid DNA isolation from *E. coli* and *B. glumae* was carried out using the alkaline lysis method, and large-scale plasmid and cosmid DNA isolations were performed by the alkaline lysis method followed by caesium chloride density gradient centrifugation (Sambrook et al., 1989). DNA fragments from pBGF2 and pBGF3 were subcloned into pBluescript SK(+) and sequenced using BigDye Terminator kits (Applied Biosystems) on ABI 3700-XL sequencers (Applied Biosystems) with universal and reverse primers. Synthetic primers were designed for primer-walking when necessary. The DNA sequences were assembled and the ORFs were identified using the SeqManII subroutine of DNASTAR. All ORFs of more than 249 bp were examined for possible ribosome-binding sites and were annotated using the BLASTX and BLASTP protocols (Altschul et al., 1990). The DNA sequence data were analysed using the BLAST program at the National Center for Biotechnology Institute (Altschul et al., 1990), MEGALIGN (DNASTAR) and GENETYX-WIN (Software Development).

#### mini-Tn5rescue, Tn3-gusA and marker-exchange mutagenesis

The wild-type strain BGR1 was mutagenized with mini-Tn5rescue, as described previously (de Lorenzo et al., 1990). Because mini-Tn5rescue carries the origin of replication and no SalI site, 1 µg of the total genomic DNA of the mutants was digested with SalI, self-ligated, and transformed into *E. coli* DH5α. Colonies that carried the flanking DNA fragments were isolated by selection on LB agar medium that contained kanamycin. The flanking region was sequenced with the Oend primer (5′-GGTTTTCCACCGTCATCACCG-3′). The pBGF2, pBGF3 and pBGF6 plasmids were mutagenized with Tn3-gusA and marker-exchanged as described previously (Bonas et al., 1989). All marker exchanges were confirmed by Southern hybridization analysis. The sites of Tn3-gusA

insertions were determined as described previously (Fellay *et al.*, 1989).

### Construction of Ω cassette insertion mutants

The Ω cassette from pHP45Ω was inserted into the unique Hpal site within the *flhD* sequence in pBGT81 to generate pBGT82. This plasmid was introduced into *B.* glumae BGR1 to generate the *flhD::Ω* mutant strain (BGS7) by marker-exchange mutagenesis. To replace the putative DNA-binding motif with the Ω cassette, a 668 bp PCR amplification product was synthesized using the oligonucleotides, mQsmR1 (5′-ACCAGCACTCGCCGGAATTCAC-3′) and mQsmR2 (5′-ATCAGATATCTTGCTCACCGGCGCGTCCGC-3′) primers. This PCR product contained terminal EcoRI and EcoRV sites. The Ω cassette was inserted into the EcoRI-PshAI site of pBGT63 to generate pBGT109. This plasmid was introduced into *B.* glumae BGR1 to construct the *qsmR::Ω* mutant strain (BGS9). We then introduced Tn3–gusA fusions, which had been constructed in the *flhC*, *fliA*, *fliC*, *tsr* and *motA* genes, into the *flhD* mutant strain BGS7, the *qsmR* mutant strain BGS9 and wild-type strain BGR1 using marker-exchange, and measured the levels of β-glucuronidase activity.

### Colony and Southern hybridizations

For colony and Southern hybridizations, the procedures used to prepare the DNA probe and for hybridization were as described by the manufacturer (Amersham Biosciences). To isolate cosmid clones that cover the flanking DNA region of the mini-Tn5rescue in the RT516 mutant strain, the 7.8 kb EcoRI fragment of pRT516E, which is a rescued plasmid from the RT516 mutant strain, was used as a probe in colony hybridization. The cosmid clone pBGF6 was isolated. To determine the number of copies of *fliC* present in the *B.* glumae genome, the 1.15 kb fragment that contains *fliC* was amplified by PCR using pBGF3 as template DNA and the FliC1 (5′-ATGCTCGGTTATTAATACTAAT-3′) and FliC1R (5′-CTGCAGCAGCTTCAGAACCTG-3′) primers, and the amplified *fliC* was used as a probe.

### Swarming and swimming assays

All the swimming and swarming assays were performed at 28°C or 37°C on LB agar plates that contained 0.7% or 0.4% Bacto agar (Difco) respectively. Each strain was inoculated into 2 ml of LB broth and incubated at 37°C for 16 h with shaking. To inoculate on LB agar medium, 1 ml of an overnight culture of each *B.* glumae strain was centrifuged, washed twice with fresh LB broth, and resuspended in 100 μl of LB broth. An aliquot (5 μl) of each cell suspension was dropped onto the swarming assay plate or 1 μl of the cell suspension was centred in the swimming assay plate and the assay plates were incubated for 18 h.

### C8-HSL and toxoflavin production assays

The QS signal molecule production assay was performed as described previously, with some modifications (Shaw *et al.*, Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd, *Molecular Microbiology*, **64**, 165–179

Regulation of flagellum genes in Burkholderia glumae 175

1997). *B.* glumae strains were grown overnight in LB broth at 37°C, centrifuged, washed twice with fresh LB broth, and subcultured in the same medium for 20 h with vigorous shaking. For inoculation onto LB agar, bacterial cells were grown overnight at 37°C in 2 ml of LB broth, centrifuged, washed twice with fresh LB broth, and resuspended in 100 μl of LB broth. An aliquot (5 μl) of each cell suspension was dropped onto a membrane filter (25 mm in diameter, Advantec MFS), which was centred on a Petri plate (90 mm in diameter, SPL) that contained 25 ml of LB agar, followed by incubating at 37°C for 20 h without shaking. The membrane filter was removed after this incubation period. To extract C8-HSL from the liquid cultures or agar plates, 0.5 ml and 25 ml of ethyl acetate were added to 0.5 ml of cell-free supernatant from the broth cultures and 25 ml of cell-free agar medium respectively. Each 0.5 ml of ethyl acetate extract was evaporated using a rotary evaporator at below 40°C, and the residue was reconstituted in 20 μl of methanol. A 1 μl sample was applied to C18 reversed-phase thin-layer chromatography (TLC) plates (Merck), and the chromatograms were developed with methanol/water (70:30, v/v). After development, the solvent was evaporated, and the dried plates were overlaid with soft agar that contained the indicator strain. For the *Chromobacterium* indicator strain, a 1 ml overnight culture was used to inoculate 50 ml of LB. After the agar solidified, the overlaid plates were incubated at 28°C in a closed plastic container. The concentration of C8-HSL produced by each strain was determined by comparison with the standard curve for synthetic C8-HSL at different concentrations.

The phytotoxins (fervenulin, reumycin and toxoflavin) used in the present study were provided by Dr Tomohisa Nagamatsu, Okayama University, Japan. Stock solutions at 10 mM in methanol (high-performance liquid chromatography grade) were diluted in the growth medium to give the desired final concentrations. The toxoflavin production assay was performed as described previously, with some modifications (Iiyama *et al.*, 1995). Each strain was grown as described above for the C8-HSL production assay. To measure the amounts of toxoflavin produced by each strain, 1 ml and 25 ml of chloroform were added to 1 ml of cell-free supernatant and 25 ml of cell-free agar medium respectively. Each 1 ml chloroform extract was evaporated to remove chloroform using a rotary evaporator. The residues were dissolved in 1 ml of aqueous 80% methanol and the absorbance at 260 nm was measured. The concentration of toxoflavin produced by each strain was determined by comparison with the standard curve for synthetic toxoflavin at different concentrations. Uninoculated LB was used as a control. For analytical TLC, 1 ml of each chloroform extract was concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The residue was dissolved in 10 μl of methanol and 2 μl samples were developed on a silica gel 60 TLC plate (Merck) with chloroform/methanol (95:5, v/v). The spots were detected under UV light (312 nm).

### β-Glucuronidase assay

The β-glucuronidase enzyme assay was performed as described previously, with some modifications (Jefferson *et al.*, 1987). All the *B.* glumae BGR1 derivatives were grown in LB medium at 37°C for 12 h with shaking. N-hexanoyl-L-homoserine lactone (C6-HSL) or C8-HSL was added at 1 μM

when the cells were subcultured. The bacterial cultures were centrifuged, resuspended in GUS extraction buffer, and lysed by sonication with a VCX-400 sonicator (Sonics and Materials). The extract was used in the β-glucuronidase enzyme assay with 4-methylumbelliferyl glucuronide as the substrate. The fluorescence was measured at 365 nm excitation and 460 nm emission wavelengths in a TKO100 fluorometer (Hoefer Scientific Instruments). One unit of β-glucuronidase was defined as 1 nmole of released 4-methylumbelliferone per bacterium per minute.

### Transmission electron microscopy

Bacterial cells were cultured on swarming or swimming plates for 18 h at 28°C or 37°C, collected, and suspended in sterile distilled water. The bacterial cells were negatively stained with a 2% aqueous solution of phosphotungstic acid (pH 7.4). A drop was spotted onto a Formvar-carbon-coated grid, and after 30 s, the liquid was withdrawn using filter papers. The samples were examined under a JEOL JEM 1010 transmission electron microscope (Jeol).

### Overexpression and purification of TofR and QsmR

To overexpress TofR in *E. coli*, the coding region of *tofR* was amplified using the chromosomal DNA of *B. glumae* BGR1 as the template and the oligonucleotide primers TOFR1 (5′-GGATCCTCTACGGCGCCTGGATCAG-3′) and TOFR2 (5′-CATATGGAACTACGCTGGCAG-3′), which introduced unique NdeI and BamHI sites at the ends of the PCR product, and the amplified product was cloned into the corresponding sites of pET14b (Invitrogen), resulting in pTOFR-His (Table 1). His-TofR was overexpressed in *E. coli* strain BL21(DE3), which carries pLysS, with the addition of 1 μM C8-HSL, as described by the manufacturer (Novagen). Soluble His-TofR was purified in a buffer that contained 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7), 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% glycerol and 100 mM NaCl, using a Ni-NTA spin column as described by the manufacturer (Qiagen). The coding region of *qsmR* was amplified using the chromosomal DNA of *B. glumae* BGR1 as the template and the oligonucleotide primers QSMR1 (5′-CGGCAGCCATATGGAAACTGAATAAAG-3′) and QSMR3 (5′-GCGGCCGCGCTCGTTGGCGTGG-3′), which incorporated unique NdeI and NotI sites at the termini of the PCR product. The amplified DNA was cloned into pET21b (Invitrogen), to generate pQSMR-His (Table 1). QsmR-His was overexpressed and purified as for His-TofR overexpression but without C8-HSL.

using the KEN1 (5′-ATCGGCCC AAAACGCAGCA-3′) and KEN2 (5′-AACGGCGG CATCAGCAA-3′) primers. Purified His-TofR (350 nM) was incubated with 2 nM of biotin-labelled DNA in binding buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 50 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 1 μM C8-HSL, 50 ng μl⁻¹ poly(dI·dC)] for 15 min at 28°C. For the competitor DNA, a 25-fold molar excess of unlabelled target DNA was added to the reaction along with extract prior to addition of the labelled DNA target. Besides the specific competitor DNA, a non-specific unlabelled competitor DNA was added to the binding reaction. The 303 bp upstream region of *flhD* was amplified by PCR using pBGT62 as the template DNA and the FD1 (5′-CGTAAGAAATCTTGGCCA-3′) and FD1R (5′-GCGAATTGTGTCAAATGT-3′) primers. QsmR-His binding to the 303 bp upstream region of *flhD* was performed using the protocols described for the His-TofR binding assay without C8-HSL. For the non-specific competitor DNA, the 301 bp upstream region of *katM2* was amplified by PCR using the KT201 (5′-TTTGCGCAGGATAACC-3′) and KT202 (5′-TCCTTGTGCAGATGGA-3′) primers. Purified QsmR-His (50 nM) was incubated with 2 nM of biotin-labelled DNA in binding buffer [10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 5% (v/v) glycerol, 50 ng μl⁻¹ poly(dI·dC)] for 15 min at 28°C. For the competitor DNA, a 25-fold molar excess of unlabelled target DNA was added to the reaction along with the extract prior to the addition of the labelled DNA target. Besides the specific competitor DNA, a non-specific unlabelled competitor DNA was added to the binding reaction. The mixtures were separated on a non-denaturing 4% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes followed by detection with streptavidin-HRP/chemiluminescence (Pierce).

### Plant inoculation

For the plant assays, all the *B. glumae* strains were grown on LB agar at 37°C for 16 h. Bacterial cells were collected with cotton-ended sticks and resuspended in sterilized distilled water. The concentration of the cell suspension was adjusted to approximately 10⁸ cfu ml⁻¹ using a spectrophotometer (Ultraspec 4000; Pharmacia Biotech). Rice plants (*Oryza sativa* cv. Milyang 23) were grown in a greenhouse, inoculated at the flowering stage with the cell suspension by dipping for 10 min, and maintained at 26–38°C in the greenhouse. The degree of panicle damage was evaluated 7 days after inoculation, as previously described (liyama et al., 1995). The pathogenicity assays were repeated three times with three replications.

### Gel mobility shift assay

The 303 bp region upstream of *qsmR* was amplified by PCR using pBGT84 as the template DNA and the RT516 (5′-TAGAACCTGAGAGACTGCA-3′) and RT516R (5′-GCTTTATTCAGTTTCGGCAC-3′) primers. The PCR product was labelled with biotin using the Lightshift Chemiluminescent Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay Kit, as described by the manufacturer (Pierce). For non-specific competitor DNA, the 242 bp upstream region of *katE* was amplified by PCR
