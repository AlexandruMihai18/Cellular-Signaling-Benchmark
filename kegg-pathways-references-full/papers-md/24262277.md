**BACKGROUND & AIMS:** Sirtuin (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent protein deacetylase that regulates hepatic lipid metabolism by modifying histones and transcription factors. Ethanol exposure disrupts SIRT1 activity and contributes to alcoholic liver disease in rodents, but the exact pathogenic mechanism is not clear. We compared mice with liver-specific deletion of Sirt1 (Sirt1LKO) mice with their LOX littermates (controls). **METHODS:** We induced alcoholic liver injury in male Sirt1LKO and control mice, placing them on Lieber-DeCarli ethanol-containing diets for 10 days and then administering a single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight) via gavage. Liver and serum samples were collected. We also measured messenger RNA levels of SIRT1, SFRS10, and lipin-1β and lipin-1α in liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis and individuals without alcoholic hepatitis (controls). **RESULTS:** On the ethanol-containing diet, livers of Sirt1LKO mice accumulated larger amounts of hepatic lipid and expressed higher levels of inflammatory cytokines than control mice; serum of Sirt1LKO mice had increased levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase. Hepatic deletion of SIRT1 exacerbated ethanol-mediated defects in lipid metabolism, mainly by altering the function of lipin-1, a transcriptional regulator of lipid metabolism. In cultured mouse AML-12 hepatocytes, transgenic expression of SIRT1 prevented fat accumulation in response to ethanol exposure, largely by reversing the aberrations in lipin-1 signaling induced by ethanol. Liver samples from patients with alcoholic hepatitis had reduced levels of $SIRT1$ and a higher ratio of $Lpin1\beta/\alpha$ messenger RNAs than controls. **CONCLUSIONS:** In mice, hepatic deletion of Sirt1 promotes steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in response to ethanol challenge. Ethanol-mediated impairment of hepatic SIRT1 signaling via lipin-1 contributes to development of alcoholic steatosis and inflammation. Reagents designed to increase SIRT1 regulation of lipin-1 can be developed to treat patients with alcoholic fatty liver disease.

steatohepatitis as well as more severe forms of liver injury, such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular cancer in humans. ${}^{1,2}$ Therefore, efforts to achieve a better understanding of alcoholic steatohepatitis pathogenesis will facilitate development of novel therapeutic strategies. Mammalian sirtuin (SIRT1) is a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide–dependent class III histone deacetylase. ${}^{3}$ The liver is one of the major organs in which SIRT1 plays an essential role in the regulation of lipid metabolism via modification of the acetylation status of a wide range of molecules, including histones and transcriptional regulators, such as sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP-1), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα), PPAR co-factor (PGC-1α), or forkhead transcription factor O 1. ${}^{3}$ SIRT1 is able to either inhibit or stimulate the activities of these targets, thereby regulating diverse lipid metabolism pathways including lipogenesis, fatty acid β-oxidation, and lipoprotein uptake and secretion in liver. SIRT1 also exerts anti-inflammatory effects by deacetylation of modified lysine residues on transcriptional regulators, such as nuclear transcription factor-$\kappa$B, which is a master transcription factor involved in regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines. ${}^{4}$ Growing evidence from human and rodent studies shows that ALD and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are closely associated with impairment of hepatic SIRT1 signaling. ${}^{3-7}$ More importantly, genetic or pharmacologic stimulation of SIRT1 protects against both ALD and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease in animals and humans. ${}^{3-7}$ The causal role of SIRT1 in pathogenesis of ALD has yet to be evaluated.

Lipin-1 is a protein that exhibits dual functions as an Mg${}^{2+}$-dependent phosphatidic acid phosphohydrolase in the triglyceride synthesis pathway and a transcriptional co-activator to promote fat oxidation and suppress de novo

lipogenesis. ${ }^{8,9}$ In the liver, lipin-1 has 2 major protein iso-
forms, lipin-$1 \alpha$ (891 amino acids) and lipin-$1 \beta$ (924 amino
acids), derived from $LPIN1$ alternative messenger RNA
(mRNA) splicing. ${ }^{10-12}$ Lipin-$1 \alpha$ and lipin-$1 \beta$ display
different subcellular localizations. ${ }^{10-12}$ In hepatocytes, lipin-
$1 \alpha$ is predominantly located in the nucleus, and lipin-$1 \beta$ is
exclusively located in the cytoplasm. ${ }^{13,14}$ The $LPIN1 \beta$ iso-
form is associated with increased expression of lipogenic
genes, and excessive hepatic lipid accumulation in ani-
mals. ${ }^{11,12}$ Accumulating evidence demonstrates that
ethanol-mediated aberrant lipin-1 signaling contributes to
development of alcoholic steatosis in rodents and
humans. ${ }^{14-18}$ Our group found that ethanol significantly
accentuates the cytoplasmic pro-lipogenic activity of lipin-1,
and lipin-1 nuclear entry is attenuated by chronic ethanol
exposure in cultured hepatocytes or in mouse livers. ${ }^{14,18}$
The net consequence of these ethanol-mediated effects on
lipin-1 localization is associated with excessive fat accu-
mulation in the liver. To date, there is little knowledge of
how SIRT1 regulates lipin-1 signaling in liver. Our recent
studies suggest that ethanol-mediated SIRT1 inhibition can
alter acetylation/sumoylation status of lipin-1, thereby dis-
rupting lipin-1 signaling in hepatocytes. ${ }^{14,18}$

SFRS10 (official gene name, TRA2B), the homolog of
Drosophila transformer-2, belongs to the SR-like protein
family of splicing factors. ${ }^{12}$ The alternatively spliced exon 6
of $LPIN1$ contains a GGAA sequence motif that binds to
SFRS10. SFRS10 emerges as an important modulator of
alternative splicing of $LPIN1 .{ }^{12}$ The effects of reduced
SFRS10 on $LPIN1$ splicing, favoring the $LPIN1 \beta$ isoform, are
sufficient to increase expression of lipogenic genes, activate
lipogenesis, and cause liver steatosis in mice. ${ }^{12}$ Of note,
SFRS10-mediated $LPIN1$ splicing is phosphohydrolase-
independent. SFRS10 is found to be down-regulated in
the fatty livers of high-fat-fed mice as well as obese
humans. ${ }^{12}$

In the current study, using hepatocyte-specific SIRT1
knockout (Sirt1LKO) mice and their LOX littermates (wild-
type [WT]), we have demonstrated for the first time that
specific ablation of hepatic SIRT1 in mice impairs lipin-1
signaling. Disruption of lipin-1 signaling results in
increased expression of genes encoding lipogenic enzymes,
reduced expression of genes encoding fatty acid oxidation
enzymes, and ultimately leads to aggravated hepatic stea-
tosis and exacerbated inflammation in response to ethanol
administration.

### Ethanol Feeding Studies

A mouse model of chronic plus single binge ethanol con-
sumption (referred as chronic-binge model) was used as
described previously. ${ }^{19,20}$ Ten to twelve-week-old male
Sirt1LKO mice and their age-matched LOX littermate (WT)
controls were divided into the following dietary groups: WT
control (low-fat diet alone, 10% of calories as fat [6% cocoa
butter and 4% safflower oil]); WT plus ethanol (identical to the
control low-fat diet but with 5% w/v ethanol added); Sirt1LKO
control; and Sirt1LKO plus ethanol. All mice were first fed a
low-fat liquid control diet for 5 days. Ethanol groups were then
fed a liquid diet containing 5% w/v ethanol for 10 days and
control mice were pair-fed to their ethanol fed counterparts for
10 days. At day 11, mice in ethanol groups were gavaged a
single dose of ethanol (5 g/kg body weight, 20% ethanol), and
mice in control groups were gavaged an isocaloric dose of
dextrin maltose. The gavage was performed in the early
morning, and mice had access to the diets after alcohol gavage.
The mice were euthanized and blood and tissue samples were
collected 9 hours post gavage. Liquid diets were freshly pre-
pared from powder daily. For mice on an ethanol-containing
diet, animal cages were placed on heating pads to maintain
body temperature to prevent ethanol-induced hypothermia.
Food intake was recorded daily. During the entire feeding
period, Sirt1LKO mice and their WT counterparts were
observed to consume similar volumes of ethanol containing-
diets. The studies were approved by the Institutional Animal
Care and Use Committee of University of South Florida.

### Measurements of Hepatic Lactate, Pyruvate, and Lipid Peroxidation

The concentrations of hepatic lactate and pyruvate were
determined using deproteinized liver samples with commercial
kits from BioVision (Mountain View, CA). ${ }^{21}$ The lipid peroxi-
dation end-product malondialdehyde in liver was measured
based on the formation of thiobarbituric reactive substances
and expressed as the extent of malondialdehyde production. ${ }^{21}$
Other reagents and methods are described in the

### Statistical Analysis

Data are expressed as mean ± SEM. Differences between
groups were analyzed using a 2-tailed unpaired Student $t$ test
(for human liver samples) or 1-way analysis of variance test,
followed by the Newman-Keuls multiple ranges test, with a
statistically significant difference defined as $P < .05$.

### Results

#### Hepatocyte-Specific Deletion of SIRT1 Alters Lipin-1 mRNA Splicing in Mice

We examined the function of SIRT1 in the liver utilizing
hepatocyte-specific SIRT1 knockout (Sirt1LKO) mice on the
C57BL/6 background. Consistent with previous findings,
Sirt1LKO mice were viable and phenotypically normal under
a chow diet. ${ }^{5}$

We then examined whether SIRT1 is associated with
lipin-1 signaling. Removal of hepatic SIRT1 significantly

induced mRNA expression levels of total lipin-1 and lipin-$1\beta$ by nearly 2.5-fold, respectively, compared with the WT controls (Figure 1A and B). Accordingly, the ratio of $Lpin1\beta/\alpha$ was increased by approximately 2-fold in the livers of Sirt1LKO mice compared with WT controls (Figure 1B). Subsequent analysis revealed that both mRNA and protein expression levels of SFRS10, a splicing factor that regulates lipin-1 mRNA alternative splicing, were severely reduced in Sirt1LKO compared with WT controls (Figure 1C and D). Collectively, these data clearly demonstrate that hepatic SIRT1 deficiency disturbs hepatic lipin-1 mRNA alternative splicing in mice.

Liver-Specific Deletion of SIRT1 Exacerbates Chronic-Binge Ethanol-Induced Fatty Liver Injury in Mice

We investigated the role of SIRT1 on alcoholic fatty liver by pair-feeding WT and Sirt1LKO mice using a chronic-binge ethanol feeding protocol (Supplementary Figure 1A). Mice were fed ethanol-containing diets for 10 days, followed by a single gavage of ethanol. Control mice were pair-fed control diets without ethanol for 10 days, followed by a single gavage of maltose.

Chronic-binge ethanol significantly increased liver weight to body weight ratio, liver triglyceride, and cholesterol, and caused mild liver steatosis in WT mice compared with pair-fed WT controls (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Ethanol feeding caused significantly higher immunohistochemical staining of F4/80+, a marker of liver inflammation, in the livers of WT mice compared with WT controls (Figure 2C and F). Interestingly, the serum aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels were significantly but mildly elevated in the ethanol-fed WT mice compared with WT controls (Supplementary Figure 1B).

and C). It has been reported that plasma alanine aminotransferase levels in mice were substantially elevated in response to chronic-binge ethanol challenge. This discrepancy might be due to the fact that a low-fat diet was used in our study.

Ethanol administration exacerbated the development of liver injury in Sirt1LKO mice compared with WT mice, as indicated by augmented liver weight to body weight ratio, markedly enhanced hepatic triglyceride and cholesterol contents, and significantly elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels, and substantially enhanced the levels of F4/80+ staining in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice compared with the livers of ethanol-fed WT mice (Figure 2 and Supplementary Table 1).

Immunohistochemical staining for Sirius red, $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin and collagen revealed higher levels of those indicators of liver fibrosis in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice compared with the livers of ethanol-fed WT mice (Figure 3 and Figure 4A). Accordingly, ethanol feeding increased the hydroxyproline content and $\alpha$-smooth muscle actin levels in Sirt1LKO mice compared with all other groups (Figure 2D). In addition, the mRNA expression of early markers of hepatic fibrosis, such as collagen I, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1, or transforming growth factor $\beta$1, was augmented in ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice compared with ethanol-fed WT mice (Figure 4B). The mRNA levels of fibronectin were significantly increased in ethanol-fed WT and in Sirt1LKO mice with or without receiving ethanol when compared with controls, and CD65 mRNA levels were unchanged in all of the groups (Supplementary Figure 2). These results suggest that ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice partially progressed from fatty liver to mild fibrotic liver.

Taken together, our data clearly demonstrate that liver-specific removal of SIRT1 exacerbates development of alcoholic fatty liver injury in mice.

### Hepatocyte-Specific Deletion of SIRT1 Drastically Exacerbates Oxidative Stress and Promotes the Inflammatory Responses in Mice Fed Ethanol

Analysis of mRNA from livers of Sirt1LKO mice revealed a significant increase in macrophage markers, such as macrophage inflammation protein and F4/80⁺, and the macrophage markers were further increased in ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice (Supplementary Figure 3A). Accordingly, the mRNA levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-α and monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, two prominent pro-inflammatory cytokines involved in pathogenesis of ALD, were significantly higher in the livers of Sirt1LKO mice fed with or without ethanol compared with WT mice, supporting the role of SIRT1 as an anti-inflammatory regulator (Supplementary Figure 3A).³⁴ Consistently, the semi-quantification of histologic inflammation showed that removal of hepatic SIRT1 promoted the liver inflammatory responses in ethanol-fed mice (Supplementary Figure 3C).

Interestingly, ethanol feeding dramatically increased the mRNA levels of 2 pro-inflammatory molecules, lipocaline-2 and serum amyloid A-1, in the livers of WT controls and Sirt1LKO mice compared with their respective controls, suggesting involvement of both SIRT1-dependent and SIRT1-independent

inflammatory mechanisms (Supplementary Figure 3B). Note that removal of hepatic SIRT1 significantly increased serum amyloid A-1 mRNA levels in the absence of ethanol.

SIRT1 ablation mildly but significantly generates oxidative stress, as demonstrated by the slight increase in hepatic malondialdehyde, a lipid peroxidation end product, compared with WT controls (Supplementary Table 1). However, ethanol feeding to Sirt1LKO mice drastically increased malondialdehyde levels approximately 5-fold compared with all other groups, demonstrating that oxidative stress is drastically exacerbated in response to ethanol administration in Sirt1LKO mice.

### Removal of Hepatic SIRT1 Promotes Ethanol-Mediated Impairment of Lipin-1 Signaling in Mice

We examined the involvement of lipin-1 signaling in exacerbated alcoholic fatty liver injury in Sirt1LKO mice. WT mice fed with ethanol or Sirt1LKO mice fed with a control diet slightly but significantly reduced the mRNA levels of hepatic lipin-1α, and lipin-1β mRNA expression levels were increased in those mice compared with WT controls (Supplementary Figure 4A). As a result, the ratio of \( Lpin1β/α \) in the livers of ethanol-fed WT mice or Sirt1LKO mice was

significantly elevated compared with WT controls (Figure 4C). More importantly, hepatic SIRT1 deficiency significantly augmented the ethanol-mediated increase of *Lpin1β/α* compared with all other groups (Figure 4C). Ethanol administration significantly inhibited mRNA and protein levels of SFRS10 in WT mice compared with WT controls (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure 4B). Ethanol-mediated SFRS10 inhibition was slightly but significantly augmented in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice compared with all other groups (Figure 4D and Supplementary Figure 4B).

Nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of lipin-1 regulates its function as a transcriptional coactivator. \[8-14,22-24\] Ethanol-fed WT mice or Sirt1LKO mice displayed a markedly increased amount of lipin-1 in the cytoplasm, and the amount of nuclear lipin-1 was significantly reduced in those mice (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 4C). Ethanol-mediated lipin-1 nucleocytoplasmic shuttling was greatly augmented in the Sirt1LKO mice compared with all other groups (Figure 4E and Supplementary Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that ethanol feeding exacerbates impairment of hepatic lipin-1 signaling in Sirt1LKO mice.

**Hepatic-Specific Removal of SIRT1 Exacerbated Ethanol-Mediated Abnormalities in Hepatic Lipid Metabolism Pathways in Mice**

Ethanol-mediated SIRT1 inhibition activates SREBP-1. \[21,25\] As such, we investigated whether SIRT1 deficiency exacerbates ethanol's stimulation of SREBP-1 signaling. The amount of active, nuclear form of SREBP-1 (nSREBP-1c) protein was highest in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice compared with all other groups (Supplementary Figure 5A and B). Immunofluorescent staining for SREBP-1 (green) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (blue) further confirmed these findings (Supplementary Figure 5C). Additionally, ethanol feeding significantly increased hepatic mRNA expression levels of lipogenic enzymes, including SREBP-1c, fatty acid synthase, stearoyl-coenzyme A desaturase 1, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), where these increases were more pronounced in ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice (Supplementary Figure 5D).

Ethanol impairs PGC-1α signaling via SIRT1. \[21\] Although ethanol significantly reduced mRNA or protein expression of PGC-1α in WT mice, PGC-1α expression levels were further suppressed in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice (Supplementary Figure 6A and B). Accordingly, SIRT1 ablation further suppressed the mRNA expression levels of several PGC-1α-regulated enzymes involved in fatty acid oxidation, including PPARα, carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1a, acyl-CoA oxidase, and CD36, to levels significantly lower than all other groups (Supplementary Figure 6C).

It is worthwhile to note that ethanol administration to Sirt1LKO mice substantially increased PPARγ mRNA levels compared with all other groups, suggesting that PPARγ also contributes, at least in part, to aggravated alcohol-induced liver steatosis in Sirt1LKO mice (Supplementary Figure 6C). Taken together, our data suggest that removal of hepatic SIRT1 in mice exacerbates ethanol-mediated abnormalities in hepatic lipid metabolism.

### Ethanol Feeding Promotes Nucleocytoplasmic Shuttling of Nuclear Factor of Activated T Cells c4 and Aggravates Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress in the Livers of SIRT1LK0 Mice

Lipin-1 regulates nuclear factor of activated T cells c4 (NFATc4), an important inflammatory factor. As shown in Figure 5A and B, in comparison with all other groups, ethanol administration to Sirt1LK0 mice robustly induced nuclear accumulation of NFATc4 and significantly decreased the amount of NFATc4 in the cytoplasm, suggesting that exacerbated inflammation in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LK0 mice might be mediated, at least in part, by impairment of the hepatic SIRT1-lipin-1-NFATc4 axis.

Roles for hepatic excessive fat accumulation, inflammation, and oxidative stress are all linked to endoplasmic reticulum stress in the etiology of alcoholic steatohepatitis. Indeed, X-box binding protein 1 mRNA splicing was significantly enhanced in the livers of Sirt1LK0 mice fed with or without ethanol compared with WT controls (Supplementary Figure 7). Consistently, significantly increased mRNA of C/EBP homologous protein was detected in ethanol-fed WT or Sirt1LK0 mice compared with WT controls (Supplementary Figure 8A). More importantly, the mRNA expression levels of X-box binding protein 1 and C/EBP homologous protein were greatly increased in ethanol-fed Sirt1LK0 mice compared with all other groups. Accordingly, increased Bip levels, phosphorylation of JNK, and total JNK expression were significantly augmented in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LK0 mice compared with other groups (Supplementary Figure 8B-D). Together, these findings demonstrate that aggravated liver injury in Sirt1LK0 results in elevated endoplasmic reticulum stress in the liver in response to ethanol challenge.

### Ethanol Metabolism Perturbs Lpin1 Alternative Splicing via SFRS10 Inhibition in AML-12 Hepatocytes

We dissected the mechanisms by which ethanol exposure disturbs hepatic lipin-1 signaling using cultured AML-12 hepatocytes. Consistent with in vivo animal studies, the mRNA levels of SFRS10 in AML-12 cells treated with ethanol were significantly lower than controls (Figure 5C). In addition, mRNA expression levels of lipin-1β were up-regulated in AML-12 cells exposed to ethanol compared with controls, and lipin-1α mRNA expression levels were significantly inhibited by ethanol exposure (Figure 5C). As a result, the Lpin1β/α ratio was significantly increased in response to ethanol exposure compared with controls (Figure 5D).

AML-12 hepatocytes. Treatment with either 4-methylpyrazole (an alcohol dehydrogenase inhibitor) or cyanamide (an aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 inhibitor) blocked the ability of ethanol to interfere with lipin-1 signaling, indicating that ethanol regulates lipin-1 mRNA alternative splicing via its metabolism (Figure 5C and D).

We further investigated whether ethanol-induced aberrant lipin-1 signaling is mediated through inhibition of the SIRT1-SFRS10 axis using a cellular alcoholic steatosis model. Incubation of AML-12 hepatocytes with ethanol increased intracellular lipid accumulation (Supplementary Figures 9 and 10A). This lipid accumulation was largely reversed when AML-12 cells were transfected with SIRT1wt or SFRS10wt. Conversely, overexpression of SIRT1H363Y, SIRT1siRNA, or SFRS10siRNA significantly augmented the triglyceride levels in AML-12 hepatocytes (Supplementary Figures 9 and 10A). Accordingly, co-transfection of SIRT1wt or SFRS10wt largely blocked the ability of ethanol to disturb the Lipin1β/α axis (Supplementary Figures 10B and 11). These SIRT1- or SFRS10-mediated protective effects were not seen when SIRT1 or SFRS10 was inhibited by SIRT1H363Y, SIRT1siRNA, or SFRS10siRNA (Supplementary

with AH, but did not reach statistical significance compared with controls (Figure 6B). Collectively, our data clearly suggest that impairments of the SIRT1-SFRS10-Lpin1β/α axis can contribute, at least in part, to development of human ALD, such as AH.

## Discussion

In the current study, using a murine model of chronic-binge ethanol feeding, we clearly demonstrated that genetic ablation of hepatic SIRT1 is associated with the rapid onset and progression of steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis in response to ethanol challenge compared with WT control mice. We found that ethanol administration to Sirt1LK0 mice disrupted lipin-1 signaling, resulting in exacerbated abnormalities in hepatic lipid metabolism, which eventually leads to steatosis and inflammation in the liver. Additional mechanistic studies revealed that ethanol metabolism specifically disturbed Lpin1β/α ratio, largely via SIRT1-SFRS10 inhibition, which results in steatosis in AML-12 hepatocytes. Consistently, the SIRT1-SFRS10-Lpin1β/α axis was perturbed in the livers from patients with AH. Altogether, our novel findings demonstrate that loss of hepatic SIRT1 aggravates alcoholic steatohepatitis in whole or in part via disrupting lipin-1 signaling in mice (Figure 7).

The current study suggests that hepatic SIRT1-lipin-1 axis represents a major signaling route in ethanol-induced steatosis in hepatocytes and in mice. In recent years, several important transcriptional regulators, such as SIRT1, SREBP-1, and PGC-1α, have been identified as specific targets of ethanol action in the liver. Among those molecules, SIRT1 appears to be the most upstream signaling molecule targeted by ethanol in liver. However, the central issue of how ethanol-mediated impairment of SIRT1 leads to

disease severity. Additional studies might be needed to evaluate if the findings obtained in these patients with severe AH are also found in the livers with mild to moderate fatty liver injury.

We found that ethanol-mediated inhibition of SIRT1 leads to reduced SFARS10 gene and protein expression levels in hepatocytes. On the other hand, ethanol can directly down-regulate SFARS10. Ethanol metabolism via alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase 2 are required for the inhibitory effect of ethanol on SFARS10 in cultured hepatocytes. Hepatic ethanol metabolism is known to causes a shift in redox state and generates oxidative stress in hepatocytes. Therefore, it is possible that SFARS10 is inhibited due to an altered redox state or excessive reactive oxygen species production in hepatocytes exposed to ethanol. The exact mechanism by which ethanol disrupts hepatic SFARS10-Lpin1β/α axis merits additional investigation.

In addition to the SIRT1-SFARS10-Lpin1β/α axis, ethanol likely affects lipin-1 at multiple levels. For instance, we have recently reported that chronic ethanol administration affects acetylation/sumoylation modifications of lipin-1 and that alteration of these modifications subsequently disturbs lipin-1 signaling in mouse livers. Therefore, ethanol-mediated SIRT1 inhibition can directly influence acetylation/sumoylation modifications of lipin-1. In addition, the impaired SIRT1-lipin-1 signaling cannot be solely responsible for alcoholic steatosis. In hepatocytes, SIRT1 interacts with PPARα and is required to activate PGC-1α to induce

observed in the livers of ethanol-fed Sirt1LKO mice. The role of the SIRT1-lipin-1 axis in ethanol-mediated hepatic inflammation is currently under investigation in our laboratory.

In summary, we have presented novel evidence that ethanol-mediated impairment of SIRT1-lipin-1 signaling is crucial in the development of alcoholic steatohepatitis in mice. Our findings further highlight the SIRT1-SFRS10-Lpin1β/α axis as a major signaling route in the pathogenesis of alcoholic liver disease. These findings suggest that nutritional or pharmacological modulation of SIRT1-SFRS10-Lpin1β/α could be potential therapeutic approaches for treating human alcoholic steatohepatitis.
