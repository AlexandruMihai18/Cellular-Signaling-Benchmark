Acyclic monoterpene primary alcohol:NADP⁺ oxidoreductase, a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of monoterpene alcohols in plants, is unstable and has been only poorly characterized. However, we have established conditions which stabilize the enzyme from *Rauwolfia serpentina* cells, and then purified it to homogeneity. It is a monomer with a molecular weight of about 44,000 and contains zinc ions. Various branched-chain allylic primary alcohols such as nerol, geraniol, and 10-hydroxygeraniol were substrates, but ethanol was inert. The enzyme exclusively requires NADP⁺ or NADPH as the cofactor. Steady-state kinetic studies showed that the nerol dehydrogenation proceeds by an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism. NADP⁺ binds the enzyme first and then NADPH is the second product released from it. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis of the reaction products showed that 10-hydroxygeraniol undergoes a reversible dehydrogenation to produce 10-oxogeraniol or 10-hydroxygeranial, which are oxidized further to give 10-oxogeranial, the direct precursor of iridodial. The enzyme has been found to exclusively transfer the pro-R hydrogen of NADPH to neral. The N-terminal sequence of the first 21 amino acids revealed no significant homology with those of various other proteins including the NAD(P)⁺-dependent alcohol dehydrogenases registered in a protein data bank.

Many indole alkaloids produced by Apocynaceae, Logania ceae, and Rubiaceae are physiologically active and have been used not only as drugs but also as poisons (1). The tryptamine moiety of indole alkaloids is known to be derived from tryptophan (2, 3). The non-tryptamine moiety is a derivative of iridoid (4, 5), which is biosynthesized from acyclic monoterpenes, i.e., geraniol and nerol, through 10-hydroxygeranial and 10-hydroxyneryl, respectively (6–9). We have established the following biosynthetic mechanism for iridoids and the non-tryptamine moiety of indole alkaloids of Rubiaceae and other plants (10–13). 10-Hydroxygeranial and 10-hydroxyneryl are oxidized to the corresponding dialdehydes (i.e., 10-oxogeranial and 10-oxoneryl), then reductively cyclized to iridodial, which is finally converted to iridoids (Scheme 1). In fact, a crude extract of cultured cells of *Rauwolfia serpentina* (Apocynaceae) (14) oxidizes 10-hydroxygeranial to produce 10-oxogeranial through 10-oxogeraniol or 10-hydroxygeranial in the presence of NADP⁺ (15). Thus, we have proposed that an NADP⁺-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase acting on 10-hydroxygeraniol plays an important role in the biosynthesis of the iridoids.

We here describe the purification of the dehydrogenase from *R. serpentina* cultured cells and its physicochemical and enzymological properties. The homogeneous enzyme indeed catalyzes both steps in the 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidation to produce 10-oxogeranial through 10-hydroxygeranial or 10-oxogeraniol (Scheme 1).

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

#### Materials
Butyl Toyopearl 650M, DEAE Toyopearl 650M, and AF-Red Toyopearl 650ML were purchased from Toso Manufacturing, Tokyo; Cellulofine GCL-1000-sf from Chisso, Tokyo; NAD⁺, NADP⁺, NADH, and NADPH from Kohjin, Tokyo; substrates and inhibitors from Tokyo Kasei, Tokyo; standard proteins for molecular weight determination from Boehringer Mannheim and Pharmacia LKB Biotechnology; iodoacetamide and Polyclar AT from Wako Pure Chemicals, Osaka; and all other chemicals were of the highest grade commercially available.

#### Spectroscopy
UV-visible spectra were recorded in a Hitachi 200-20, circular dichroism spectra in a Jasco J-600, atomic absorption spectra in a Shimadzu AA-670G, and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was performed in a Hitachi M80-A equipped with a 003B data system. Isoelectric points were determined with a Pharmacia Phast System.

#### Synthesis
Geraniol was acetylated with acetic anhydride, then oxidized with selenium dioxide in the presence of tert-butyl hydroperoxide to produce 10-oxogeranyl acetate, which was hydrolyzed with potassium carbonate in water to give 10-oxogeraniol. 10-Oxogeranyl acetate was reduced with sodium borohydride to yield 10-hydroxygeranyl acetate, which was hydrolyzed with potassium carbonate

**Geraniol** was oxidized to geranial with manganese dioxide, then hydroxylated at C-10 with selenium dioxide to afford 10-hydroxygeranial. Neric acid was prepared from nerol by sodium chlorite oxidation (17) and esterified with diazomethane. Neric acid methyl ester obtained was reduced with \([^{2}H_{4}]\)-lithium aluminum hydride to give \([1-{^2}H_{2}]\)nerol. The C-4 hydrogen of NADP⁺ was replaced by deuterium from deuterium oxide with potassium cyanide. \([4-{^2}H]\)NADP⁺ was reduced stereospecifically to \((4R)\) and \((4S)\)-\([4-{^2}H]\)-NADPH with D-glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and isocitrate dehydrogenase, respectively; then these products were purified with DEAE Toyopearl, followed by crystallization as the barium salts (18).

#### Enzyme Assay
The activity of acyclic monoterpene primary alcohol dehydrogenase was determined in a reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 20 μmol of Bis Tris Propane HCl buffer (pH 9.0), 0.4 μmol of NADP⁺, 2 μmol of 10-hydroxygeranial, and the enzyme at 25°C. The reaction was started by addition of the substrate dissolved in 10 μl acetone. The NADPH produced was determined at 340 nm. One unit of the enzyme activity was defined as that amount which catalyzes the formation of 1 μmol of NADPH per minute at 25°C. The reverse reaction was followed in a reaction mixture (1.0 ml) containing 20 μmol of Bis Tris Propane HCl buffer (pH 7.0), 0.1 μmol of NADPH, 1 μmol of 10-hydroxygeranial, and the enzyme at 25°C.

#### Protein Determination
Protein was determined by the method of Bradford (19). Bovine serum albumin was used as the standard. Protein was monitored at 280 nm during purification.

#### Cultivation of Cells
The cell culture of *R. serpentina* was prepared and provided as a gift by Prof. Dr. M.H. Zenk of Munich University. Cells were grown in Linsmaier-Skoog medium containing 1 μM 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid and potassium naphthalene acetate for 7 days. They were collected by filtration through Miracloth, washed with distilled water, frozen in liquid nitrogen, then stored at −80°C until use. The frozen cells were kept at −80°C with only slight loss of activity for 6 months.

#### Enzyme Purification
All purification procedures were carried out in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 20% glycerol below 4°C unless otherwise stated.

##### Step 1: Preparation of crude extract
The frozen cells (383 g), suspended in 800 ml of 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 20 g Polyclar AT, were stirred for 3 h in a nitrogen atmosphere and then filtered through Miracloth. The crude extract (980 ml) was obtained by centrifugation at \(10,000 \times g\) for 30 min.

##### Step 2: Ammonium sulfate precipitation
Ammonium sulfate was added to the crude extract at 35% saturation with stirring. The mixture was then centrifuged at \(10,000 \times g\) for 30 min. The supernatant solution was brought to 70% saturation by further addition of ammonium sulfate. The protein precipitate, collected by centrifugation at \(10,000 \times g\) for 30 min, was dissolved in 45 ml of 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20% saturated ammonium sulfate.

##### Step 3: Butyl Toyopearl hydrophobic chromatography
The enzyme solution was applied to a Butyl Toyopearl 650M column (2.5 × 10 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol and 20% saturated ammonium sulfate. The column was washed with the above buffer. The protein was eluted by decreasing the ammonium sulfate concentration linearly from 20 to 0%. The active fractions eluted with 0% ammonium sulfate were combined and glycerol was then added to the solution at a final concentration of 20%. The enzyme solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration with an Amicon PM10 membrane followed by dialysis against the standard buffer.

##### Step 4: DEAE Toyopearl column chromatography
The enzyme solution (142 ml) was applied to a DEAE Toyopearl 650M column (2.5 × 7.5 cm) equilibrated with 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0). The enzyme was eluted by a linear increase in NaCl concentration up to 300 mM. The active fractions were combined, dialyzed against 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol, then concentrated to about 20 ml with a PM10 membrane.

##### Step 5: AF-Red Toyopearl dye affinity column chromatography
The enzyme was applied to an AF-Red Toyopearl 650ML column (1 × 8 cm), which was washed with 20 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0) containing 1 mM dithiothreitol. The enzyme was eluted with a linear gradient elution between 0 and 1 M KCl. Active fractions were combined and glycerol was then added to the solution at a

final concentration of 20%, then concentrated to 5.2 ml with a PM10 membrane.

**Step 6: Cellulofine GCL-1000-sf column chromatography:** The enzyme solution was applied to a Cellulofine GCL-1000-sf column (1.6 × 90 cm). The enzyme was eluted in a fraction 80 ml after the void volume at a flow rate of 3 ml/day. This was the final preparation of the enzyme, which was stored at −20°C until use.

**Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry—Enzymatic oxidation of 10-hydroxygeraniol:** Enzymatic oxidation of 10-hydroxygeraniol was carried out in a reaction mixture (500 μl) containing 10 μmol of Bis Tris Propane HCl buffer (pH 9.0), 0.2 μmol of NADP⁺, 2 μmol of 10-hydroxygeraniol, and the enzyme (0.0137 unit) at 22°C. The reaction mixture was extracted with 300 μl of dichloromethane by mixing with a Vortex mixer for 10 s. After centrifugation at 5,000 rpm, 1 μl of the organic phase was subjected to gas chromatography-mass spectrometric analysis using a splitless injection mode and an electron impact ionization mode at 20 eV. The gas chromatography was operated on a Carbowax 20M (0.25 mm × 25 m) column with a film thickness of 0.25 μm (Quadrex, U.S.A.). The oven temperature was programmed from 50 to 100°C at 40°C/min, then at 4°C/min to 230°C. The injector and ion source temperatures were 260 and 100°C, respectively. Under these conditions the retention times were as follows: nerol, 7.4 min; 10-hydroxygeraniol, 22.3 min; 10-oxogeraniol, 19.7 min; 10-hydroxygeranial, 21.4 min; and 10-oxogeranial, 19.1 min.

**Standard Calibration Curves:** The standard calibration curves were obtained by the computer-reconstructed mass chromatograms of authentic samples which contained varying amounts of 10-oxogeraniol and 10-hydroxygeraniol. The mass chromatograms were reconstructed from the characteristic ions: 10-oxogeraniol, *m/z* 135; 10-hydroxygeranial, *m/z* 94. The relationship between the peak areas and amounts of the standard samples were linear in the concentration range from 0.04 to 0.5 mM.

**RESULTS**

**Enzyme Purification:** The enzyme was unstable and became completely inactive within 7 days when it was kept in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) at a protein concentration of 176 μg/ml and at 4°C. However, addition of 20% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol prevented the enzyme from losing its activity. Thus, we routinely added these ingredients at the concentrations indicated to all the solutions used for the enzyme preparation and did all operations below 4°C. Table I shows a summary of the purification of the enzyme from the cell suspension cultures of *R. serpentina*. The specific activity of the final preparation was about 87-fold higher than that of the crude extract. The purified enzyme was found to be homogeneous by sodium lauryl sulfate PAGE. The single protein band stained by Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 corresponded to the band stained by 10-hydroxygeraniol dehydrogenase activity.

The purified enzyme can be stored in 20 mM Tris HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 20% glycerol and 1 mM dithiothreitol at −20°C for 6 months without loss of activity.

**Physicochemical Properties:** The molecular weight of the native enzyme was estimated to be about 50,000 by gel filtration on Cellulofine GCL-1000-sf. SDS-PAGE showed that the enzyme is composed of a single polypeptide with a molecular weight of about 44,000. The pI of the dehydrogenase was determined to be 5.4 by isoelectric focusing. Figure 1 shows the circular dichroism spectrum of the dehydrogenase between 180 and 250 nm. The enzyme showed a negative extremum at 209 nm and positive maximum at 192 nm. The secondary structure of the enzyme was estimated by Johnson's equation (20) as follows: α-helix, 27.5%; β-sheet, 30.0%; random coil, 42.5%. The enzyme was analyzed by atomic absorption for the following metal ions: Zn, Mo, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mg, Ca, Se, Pt, and Au. Only zinc ions were found in the enzyme. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme was determined with an automated gas phase sequence analyzer (an Applied Biosystems 477A protein-peptide sequencing system): NH₂-Asn-Gln-Gln-X-X-Thr-Lys-Val-Thr-Lys-Met-Val-Tyr-Lys-Leu-Val-Leu-Val-Trp-Thr-Val (X could not be identified). The amino acid sequence of the N-terminal sequence is quite different from those of other dehydrogenases so far isolated from microorganisms, plants, and animal tissue.³

**Catalytic Properties:** The enzyme rapidly and irreversibly lost its activity when dithiothreitol (1 mM) and glycerol (20%, v/v) were omitted from the enzyme solution. Therefore, both reagents were routinely added to the enzyme solution at the concentrations indicated. The enzyme was inactivated by incubation (25°C, 5 min) with

### Text Extract

thiol reagents (10 mM) in 20 mM Bis Tris Propane HCl (pH 9.0): iodoacetamide, 46% inhibition; N-ethylmaleimide, 100%. This suggests that sulfhydryl groups are required for the enzyme catalysis, although further studies, for example, by means of site-directed mutagenesis, are required to clarify the function of the sulfhydryl groups. The enzyme retained its full activity between pH 7.0 and 10.0 upon incubation in 50 mM Bis Tris Propane HCl (pH 7.0–9.0) or CAPS NaOH (pH 9.0–11.0) at a protein concentration of 3.3 mg/ml and 25°C for 20 h. The enzyme requires NADP⁺ or NADPH exclusively as a coenzyme. NAD⁺ and NADH were inert under the same conditions except that NADP⁺ and NADPH were replaced by NAD⁺ and NADH, respectively. The \(K_m\) value for NADP⁺ was 25 μM when it was determined with nerol as the substrate (0.4 mM). In the reduction of neral at the concentration of 2 mM, the enzyme showed a \(K_m\) value of 5.5 μM for NADPH. The pH optima for the oxidation of 10-hydroxygeraniol and its reverse reaction were determined with 20 mM Bis Tris HCl (pH 5.0–7.0), Bis Tris Propane HCl (pH 7.0–9.0), and CAPS NaOH (pH 9.0–11.0) to be 9.0 for oxidation, and 7.0–10.0 for reduction. The primary isotope effect was observed for the hydrogen abstraction at C-1 of nerol. The rate of \([1-\ce{^1H_2}]\) nerol oxidation was about 2.3 times higher than that of the \([1-\ce{^2H_2}]\) counterparts.

**Substrate Specificity—** Among the alcohols examined so far, the enzyme specifically acted on primary alcohols. Secondary alcohols such as menthol and a tertiary alcohol, linalool, were inert as substrates at the concentration used (2 mM). However, ethanol was not a substrate. Only aldehydes were substrates in the reverse reaction, while ketones (e.g., piperitone and carvone) were not substrates at the concentration of 2 mM (Tables II and III).

Branched-chain primary alcohols with allylic double bonds such as nerol and geraniol were the substrates. Straight-chain allylic alcohols such as trans-2-hexenol and trans-2-heptenol were also substrates, but trans-crotyl alcohol, 1-pentanol, 1-heptanol, and 1-octanol were inert at the concentration used (2 mM). Saturation of the 2,3-double bond of geraniol resulted in a marked decrease in the reactivity: citronellol and 3,7-dimethyl-1-octanol were only poor substrates. These results indicate that allylic primary alcohols with a carbon chain length of more than 6 serve as the substrates.

The enzyme shows much lower affinity for 10-hydroxygeraniol than for geraniol (Table II). The \(K_m\) value for 10-hydroxygeraniol is about 10 times higher than that for geraniol in the reverse reaction (Table III). Thus, the hydrophobicity of the substrate molecule appears to affect the affinity for the enzyme.

Saturated primary alcohols inhibited the dehydrogenation of 10-hydroxygeraniol. The degree of inhibition increased with an increase in carbon chain length (Table II). Menthol was inert as a substrate at the concentration of 2 mM, and inhibited the enzyme competitively against 10-hydroxygeraniol (\(K_i = 530\) μM).

The yields of 10-oxogeraniol (○) and 10-hydroxygeranial (●) from 10-hydroxygeraniol were determined by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. The conditions for the reactions and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry are described in “EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES.”

The results indicate an ordered Bi-Bi mechanism in which NADP⁺ is the first substrate binding to the enzyme and NADPH is the second product dissociating from it (Table IV).

**Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometric Analysis of the Reaction Products—10-Hydroxygeraniol is oxidized in vivo to the corresponding dialdehyde derivative, 10-oxogeranial, which is reductively cyclized to iridodial, the precursor of iridoids (11–13). Therefore, we have examined whether the enzyme oxidizes both C-1 and C-10 of 10-hydroxygeraniol by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. 10-Hydroxygeraniol was enzymatically converted to two products, which are identical with authentic 10-oxogeranial and 10-hydroxygeranial. 10-Oxogeraniol was produced in proportion to time. 10-Hydroxygeranial was rapidly accumulated with time, but the amount decreased after the maximum was reached (Fig. 2). 10-Oxogeranial was not formed under the conditions because NADP⁺ in the reaction system was almost exhausted, but 10-oxogeranial was produced from either 10-oxogeranial or 10-hydroxygeranial when each of them was separately incubated with a mixture of NADP⁺ and the enzyme. 10-Hydroxygeraniol was reduced to 10-hydroxygeraniol much more rapidly than 10-oxogeranial (Table III). Moreover, only 10-oxogeraniol was detected as a product when 10-oxogeranial was incubated with NADPH and the enzyme.**

**Stereospecificity of Hydrogen Transfer—The hydrogen transfer between [4-²H]NADPH and neral was examined by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Nerol produced with (4R) and (4S)-[4-²H]NADPH showed parent ions as follows: the (4R) isomer, at \(m/z\) 155; and (4S), at \(m/z\) 154. These indicate that the enzyme transfers exclusively the pro-R hydrogen at C-4 of NADPH to neral.**

**Kinetic Mechanism—Initial velocities obtained by varying the NADP⁺ concentrations at three fixed concentrations of nerol gave converging line relationships. This indicates the involvement of a sequential mechanism. Product inhibition studies were carried out to determine the type of sequential mechanism. The enzyme activity was determined with various concentrations of one substrate and unsaturating or saturating concentrations of the other substrate in the absence or presence of the products. The**

### DISCUSSION

Various alcohol dehydrogenases with different substrate and coenzyme specificities occur in plants (21). Potato tubers produce at least three kinds of alcohol dehydrogenases (22): one is active with NAD⁺ and aliphatic alcohols, the second active with NADP⁺ and terpene alcohols, and the last active with NADP⁺ and aromatic alcohols. The enzymes of the first group are classified as [EC 1.1.1.1] and have been extensively studied. In particular, the enzymes of maize, pea, and thale cress (*Arabidopsis thaliana*) have been characterized in detail and their primary structures have been determined (23–27). Most enzymes of [EC

Vol. 109, No. 2, 1991
1.1.1.1] act on terpene alcohols (e.g., geraniol) to some extent in addition to ethanol (28). Geraniol dehydrogenase [EC 1.1.1.183], which requires only NADP⁺ and does not act on ethanol, was partially purified from orange vesicles (29). We have purified a similar NADP⁺-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase to homogeneity from cultured *R. serpentina* cells. The *R. serpentina* enzyme resembles geraniol dehydrogenase of orange in that it catalyzes dehydrogenation of nerol and geraniol efficiently. However, it differs from the orange enzyme not only in relative activity toward geraniol vs. nerol but also in molecular weight. Geraniol is much better as a substrate than nerol for the orange enzyme, whereas the preference is reversed for the *R. serpentina* enzyme. The orange enzyme has a molecular weight much higher (92,000) than the *R. serpentina* enzyme (50,000). Therefore, we designated the *R. serpentina* enzyme acyclic monoterpenoid primary alcohol:NADP⁺ oxidoreductase in order to discriminate it from the orange enzyme and also from others acting on geraniol and nerol as lateral substrates.

All the alcohol dehydrogenases thus far purified from higher plants are dimers with a subunit molecular weight of about 40,000 (27, 30). High homology in the primary structure has been found among alcohol dehydrogenases [EC 1.1.1.1] of maize, pea, and Arabidopsis (27). Thirteen residues out of 21 N-terminal residues are conserved. The acyclic monoterpenoid primary alcohol dehydrogenase of *R. serpentina* differs from others in the subunit structure. It is a monomer with molecular weight of 44,000. Moreover, the enzyme has no homology in the N-terminal amino acid sequence with other NAD(P)⁺-dependent dehydrogenases. Therefore, the enzyme has been probably evolved from a different ancestral protein from those for other alcohol dehydrogenases or diverged extensively from other enzymes during evolution from the common ancestral protein.

Alcohol dehydrogenases [EC 1.1.1.1] can be classified into two groups according to the metal ions contained and stereospecificity of the hydrogen transfer (30, 31). Zinc-containing dehydrogenases with high subunit molecular weight (40,000) are pro-R specific, whereas enzymes containing no metals with a low subunit molecular weight (25,000) are pro-S specific. The rule can be applied to the enzymes of other groups. NADP⁺-specific cinnamyl alcohol dehydrogenase of soybean cell suspension cultures, which is composed of two identical subunits with a molecular weight of about 40,000, contains zinc ions and shows the pro-R stereospecificity (32). This is also the case for the acyclic monoterpenoid primary alcohol dehydrogenase of *R. serpentina*. It is also a zinc protein with a molecular weight of about 44,000 and shows the pro-R stereospecificity, although it has a monomeric structure.

We have found that a cis-allylic alcohol, nerol, is much more effective as a substrate of the acyclic monoterpenoid primary alcohol dehydrogenase of *R. serpentina* than the corresponding trans counterpart. Moreover, the C-1 of 10-hydroxygeraniol is more susceptible to the enzymatic dehydrogenation than the C-10. This preference is probably determined by interaction of the hydrophobic binding site and methyl groups at C-3 and C-8. Therefore, the substrate binding site of the enzyme can recognize even a small difference in the structure of the hydrophobic chain of the substrate.

We have shown that the non-tryptamine moiety of indole alkaloids is synthesized *in vivo* from 10-hydroxygeraniol through iridodial (12), and that a crude extract of cultured *R. serpentina* cells oxidizes 10-hydroxygeraniol to give 10-oxogeranial, 10-oxogeraniol, and 10-hydroxygeranial in the presence of NADP⁺ (15). We show in this study that the homogeneous preparation of the acyclic monoterpenoid primary alcohol dehydrogenase of *R. serpentina* indeed catalyzes the oxidation of 10-hydroxygeraniol to 10-oxogeranial through 10-hydroxygeranial or 10-oxogeraniol (Scheme 1). This fact has been facilitated for the first time by means of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Thus, this single enzyme most probably participates in the oxidation of 10-hydroxygeraniol *in vivo*.

We gratefully acknowledge Prof. Dr. M.H. Zenk (Munich University, Munich, Germany) for providing *R. serpentina* cells.
