**Abstract** An elevated level of low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol constitutes a major risk factor for genesis of atherosclerosis. Ox-LDL plays a more important role in the genesis and progression of atherosclerosis than the native LDL. Ox-LDL leads to endothelial dysfunction leading to expression of adhesion molecules and recruitment of monocyte in subendothelial space. Ox-LDL is taken up by macrophages via scavenger receptors, such as SR-A1, SR-A2 and LOX-1. Lately, LOX-1, a type II membrane protein receptor of ox-LDL, has gained much importance in relation to effects of ox-LDL on endothelial biology. Endothelial cells primarily express LOX-1 as receptor for ox-LDL and ox-LDL has been shown to upregulate expression of LOX-1. In addition, ox-LDL promotes the growth and migration of smooth muscle cells, monocytes/macrophages and fibroblasts. In this review we discuss the role of ox-LDL and LOX-1 in genesis and progression of atherosclerosis.

**Introduction**

Over the last several decades it has become evident that oxidatively modified low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (ox-LDL) plays a major role in the development and progression of atherosclerosis and its complications. Atherosclerosis represents a heterogeneous group of path-

ological phenomena that include degenerative, inflammatory and proliferative processes which produce lesions containing mainly cellular material, lipid, collagen and calcium [1]. Most cardiovascular risk factors, such as smoking [2], diabetes mellitus [3], dyslipidemia [4] and hypertension [5, 6] induce oxidative stress in the vessel wall. As LDL-cholesterol traverses the sub-endothelial space it becomes oxidized in response to “oxidative stress” resulting in the formation of ox-LDL. Formation of fatty streak is the first and most important step in genesis of atherosclerosis. Fatty streaks are small sub-endothelial deposits of monocyte-derived macrophages. Oxidized LDL (ox-LDL) is the primary stimulus that leads to endothelial activation and injury resulting in an inflammatory response that leads to recruitment, activation and migration of monocytes through inter-endothelial gaps to the sub-endothelial region [1]. These monocytes upon differentiating into macrophages in the sub-endothelium ingest ox-LDL via scavenger receptors [1], resulting in transformation of macrophages to foam cells [1]. Ox-LDL inhibits the expression of constitutive nitric oxide synthase [7], induces expression of adhesion molecules [8] and stimulates collagen formation in fibroblast [9]. This leads to formation of fibrous capsule, converting fatty streak to atheroma [9, 10]. Ox-LDL has a multitude of actions on vascular smooth muscle cells—including their migration and proliferation and changes their phenotype to foam cells [10–12]. Ox-LDL has also been shown to activate platelets [13]. Ox-LDL also results in generation of reactive oxygen species from a variety of cell types—endothelial cells, vascular smooth muscle cells, leukocytes and platelets [14–16]. Many of the effects of ox-LDL are mediated via expression and activation of LOX-1, a non-traditional scavenger found in the membranes of a variety of cells (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1 A cartoon depicting various events in atherogenesis. Oxidized LDL (Ox-LDL) is taken up by endothelial cells which become activated and express LOX-1. Activated endothelial cells express adhesion molecules facilitating monocyte adhesion and migration into subendothelial layers where they engulf ox-LDL and become transformed into macrophages—which then release growth factors. Ox-LDL also stimulates smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation. Ox-LDL also stimulates fibroblasts to grow and form collagen. Ox-LDL is also a potent stimulus for release of metalloproteinases and platelet aggregation. Angiotensin acts on its type 1 receptor (AT1R) which has effects similar to those of Ox-LDL
domain and a short cytoplasmic tail. Structurally it belongs to the C-type lectin family, which binds carbohydrates in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner, and is comprised of four domains: a short N-terminal cytoplasmic domain, a single transmembrane domain; a short ‘neck’ or stalk region and a C-type lectin-like fold [17–19]. These receptors are expressed on endothelial cells, monocytes, platelets, cardiomyocytes and vascular smooth muscle cells as well as in renal, pulmonary and neuronal tissues [20–24].

LOX-1 expression can be induced under pathological conditions, such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension, myocardial ischemia and atherosclerosis [25–28]. Activation of LOX-1 is responsible for ox-LDL and angiotensin II (Ang II)-mediated cell injury and their biological effects such as regulation of blood pressure. LOX-1 expression can also be induced by ox-LDL, free radicals (reactive oxygen species), endothelin-1 (ET-1), angiotensin II, advanced glycation end products (AGEs) and shear stress [29–31]. It is interesting that ox-LDL can upregulate its own receptor at transcriptional level in human endothelial cells in a time-and concentration-dependent fashion [19]. The upregulation of LOX-1 in response to ox-LDL can be blocked by a specific antibody or antisense to LOX-1 mRNA.

LOX-1 activation also may be the key intermediary for the cross-talk between renin-angiotensin system and dyslipidemia that is often present in hypertensive patients [32]. Ang II that acts via activation AT1R receptor is a potent direct vasoconstrictor playing an important role in genesis of atherosclerosis [33]. Ox-LDL upregulates AT1R mRNA via NADPH oxidase-MAPK-NF-kB pathway. Ang II in a positive feedback fashion upregulates the expression of LOX-1 [34, 35]. Chen et al. [32] showed that when AT1R blocker candesartan or an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor rosuvastatin were administered singularly in APO E KO mice fed on high cholesterol diet, there was modest decrease in LOX-1 expression and atherosclerosis, but when used in combination these drugs completely blocked LOX-1 expression, thus reducing atherosclerosis. This showed that Ang II and dyslipidemia play a mutually facilitative role in genesis and progression of atherosclerosis.

The hyperglycemic state of diabetes leads to glycation of proteins and formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE). These products accumulate in the vessel wall by interaction with their selective receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) [36]. Advanced glycation end products are also ligands for other cell receptors such as lectin-like oxidized receptor 1 (LOX-1) which leads to activation of several cell types involved in the atherosclerotic progression [37, 38]. Activation of LOX-1 receptors induced by AGEs contributes to vascular endothelial dysfunction, by inducing proinflammatory redox-sensitive transduction and transcription pathways [37, 38]. Activation of LOX-1 by AGEs also results in the intracellular enhancement in reactive oxygen species formation [39] (essentially by activation of NAD(P)H oxidase and mitochondrial respiratory chain [37, 39–41] and the activation of p44/p42 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [42–44], thus leading to the activation of nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) [45–47]. As a consequence, stimulation of endothelial cells by AGE and glucose has been shown to enhance the release of endothelial proinflammatory mediators such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and tumor necrosis factor-α, thus contributing to progression of atherosclerosis [44, 48].

Endothelin-1 (ET-1) has been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases [49]. It is known that ET-1 plasma level is increased in patients with hypertension and coronary artery disease. Also, there are studies in literature suggesting local increase in ET-1 concentrations in the atherosclerotic plaques [50, 51]. Furthermore, ET-1 receptor blockade has been shown to reduce the development of atherosclerotic lesions in studies in apo E-KO mice [52]. Morawietz et al. [53] first showed that ET-1 induces LOX-1 mRNA and protein expression in a time- and dose-dependent manner in human endothelial cells and promotes ox-LDL uptake. ET-1 via ETB receptor, exclusively expressed on endothelial cells, enhances oxidative modification of LDL to ox-LDL, further increasing the uptake of ox-LDL in endothelial cells via LOX-1 receptor which leads to progression of atherosclerosis [53].

Endothelial cells lining the inner surface of vessel walls are in direct contact with blood flow, which generates hemodynamic shear stress acting on the apical surface of vascular endothelium [54, 55]. Murase et al. [31] first showed that physiological levels of laminar fluid flow shear stress transcriptionally induces LOX-1 expression in BAECs by mechanism which is dependent on intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization. The expression of LOX-1 receptor by fluid shear stress may play an important role in the localized formation of atherosclerotic lesions in vivo. Thus LOX-1 plays a very important role in atherogenesis [56].

As mentioned earlier, oxidant stress is a disturbance in the normal redox state due to imbalance between production of oxygen species and body’s innate ability to detoxify the reactive intermediates or repair resulting cellular damage. Reactive oxygen species denature all components of cell including proteins, lipids and DNA [57]. The main source of reactive oxygen species in vivo is aerobic respiration taking place in mitochondria [58]. Reactive oxygen species are also produced by peroxisomal oxidation of fatty acids, microsomal cytochrome P450 metabolism of xenobiotic compounds, stimulation of phagocytosis by pathogens or lipopolysaccharides, arginine metabolism, and tissue-specific enzymes [59]. The generation of intracellular reactive oxygen species can involve multipleenzyme systems such as NADPH oxidase (generates superoxide anion) [60], mitochondrial electron transport enzymes [58, 61], xanthine oxidase [62], lipoxygenase [63], cyclooxygenase [64], myeloperoxidase [65], cytochrome P450 enzymes [66], and uncoupled endothelial NO synthetase [67].

In the blood vessels, generation of reactive oxygen species from endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages seems to be of major relevance in atherogenesis, in part due to their reaction with nitric oxide (NO) [68, 69]. NO, produced constitutively in the endothelium by NO synthase (eNOS or cNOS), has a major role in the regulation of blood pressure [70] and prevention of atherosclerosis by decreasing leukocyte adhesion and smooth muscle proliferation. NO is perhaps the most important endothelium-derived vasorelaxing factor. It is scavenged by reactive oxygen species leading to formation of peroxynitrite, which can be toxic to tissues. An important source of reactive oxygen species is uncoupling of eNOS due to limited availability of its cofactor tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4) and oxidation of BH4 to BH2 [67, 68]. Uncoupled eNOS leads to generation of reactive oxygen species rather than nitric oxide, which can further oxidize native unmodified LDL to ox-LDL.

Important pathophysiological consequences of enhanced reactive oxygen species formation in the vascular system are: (1) endothelial injury, activation and dysfunction; (2) induction of inflammation; (3) oxidation of LDL; (4) platelet and leukocyte activation and (5) initiation of a host of intracellular signaling processes. As the process of atherogenesis proceeds, inflammatory cells and other constituents of the atherosclerotic plaque release large amounts of reactive oxygen species, which further facilitate atherogenesis [1]. The details of the role of reactive oxygen species and LOX-1 in the genesis of atherosclerosis has been discussed in detail in another review by the same authors [59].

LOX-1 and endothelial activation and vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation

A normal and healthy endothelium regulates vascular tone and structure and exerts anticoagulant, anti-platelet and fibrinolytic properties. The maintenance of vascular tone is accomplished by the release of numerous dilators like NO, prostacyclin and bradykinin, and constrictor substances like ET-1 and Ang II [71]. Both ET-1 and Ang II promote proliferation of smooth muscle cells and, thereby, contribute to the formation of the atherosclerotic plaque [51, 52]. Activated macrophages and vascular smooth muscle cells, major components of atherosclerotic plaque, produce large amounts of ET-1 [72]. Damage to the endothelium upsets the balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation

and initiates a number of events that lead to endothelial dysfunction. A study by Ludmer et al. [73] provided the first evidence in humans of impaired endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the presence of atherosclerosis.

The term endothelial dysfunction refers to several pathological conditions that include altered anti-coagulant and anti-inflammatory properties of the endothelium, impaired modulation of vascular growth, and deregulation of vascular remodeling. The most important characteristic of endothelial dysfunction is impaired synthesis, release and activity of endothelium-derived NO. Studies from several laboratories have demonstrated that NO inhibits a number of steps involved in atherogenesis [74, 75]. For example, endothelium-derived NO inhibits endothelial activation (characterized by a pro-adhesive cell surface), platelet aggregation, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and endothelium-leukocyte interactions. Ox-LDL and other mediators of atherosclerosis such as Ang II, by increasing reactive oxygen species generation and LOX-1 upregulation, induce endothelial dysfunction [76].

Several studies have shown a correlation between endothelial dysfunction and the presence of coronary risk factors in persons with no clinical evidence of coronary artery disease, indicating that coronary risk factors may predict endothelial dysfunction. Many of the traditional coronary risk factors that predispose a person to the development of atherosclerosis, such as hypertension, smoking, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia and a positive family history of premature of coronary artery disease have been found to be associated with endothelial dysfunction [77, 78].

There is evidence that endothelial dysfunction is associated with clinical events related to atherosclerosis. A study in patients with mild (non-obstructive) coronary artery disease suggested that severe coronary endothelial dysfunction significantly increased the risk of cardiac events over an average follow-up of 28 months. In contrast, patients with mild dysfunction or normal endothelial function experienced no cardiac events [79]. Research linking endothelial dysfunction with risk factors for coronary artery disease has opened potentially useful novel avenues of investigation into the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease and also into the development of therapies targeting the endothelium

Another important characteristic feature of atherosclerosis is proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. Reactive oxygen species have been shown to stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell growth and their proliferation. Ox-LDL by increasing reactive oxygen species generation leads to increase in generation of a variety of growth factors, such as fibroblast growth factor [80, 81], insulin-like growth factor-1 and epidermal growth factor and expression of their receptors, thus inducing vascular smooth muscle cells proliferation and hypertrophy. It is well known that reactive
oxygen species can also induce vascular smooth muscle cell death by either apoptosis or necrosis, but this process occurs in the final stage of atherosclerosis and requires large amounts of reactive oxygen species [15]. Many of these effects are mediated via LOX-1 since LOX-1 blockade by a specific LOX-1 antisense reduces endothelial injury by inhibiting apoptosis and decreasing MMP release and CD40 expression [82–86]. In one of the studies, our group showed that the arterial segments from LOX-1 null mice maintain endothelium-dependent relaxation despite treatment with ox-LDL [56]. These observations suggest that loss of eNOS activity is response to ox-LDL is mediated via LOX-1. We have discussed these aspects more extensively in another review on a similar topic [59].

### LOX-1 and angiogenesis

Angiogenesis defined as formation of new capillaries is a key component of embryonic development and is necessary for tissue survival. Angiogenesis is observed in atherosclerotic and cancerous tissues and plays an important role in progression of these diseases [87, 88]. It also plays an important role in wound repair [89]. Vascular endothelial growth factor is the key angiogenic growth factor that stimulates proliferation, cell migration and capillary tube formation [90, 91]. Small concentrations of ox-LDL [90] and Ang II [91] can induce angiogenesis via activation of NADPH oxidase, MAPKs (p38 and p44/42 MAPK subunits) and NFκB p65 leading to upregulation of LOX-1.

The process of angiogenesis may have important clinical consequences in atherosclerosis. Progressive angiogenesis in a primary atherosclerotic lesion may cause plaque expansion and plaque vulnerability [92]. Angiogenesis also promotes intravascular thrombosis. The development of an atherosclerotic lesion involves three distinct patho-anatomic stages—1) Initiation stage, 2) Progression stage and 3) Complication stage. In the initiation stage, vasavasorum formation occurs in areas of subsequent atheroma development [92, 93]. Progression stage is characterized by extension of adventitial neovasculature into the enlarging plaque. Most advanced atherosclerotic lesions, especially the so-called “vulnerable” plaque regions, are fairly well neovascularized [92, 93], suggesting that the degree of angiogenesis is independent of size of the plaque. Further, the aggressive neovascularization process seems to characterize the advanced inflamed biologically “active” plaque.

### LOX-1 and apoptosis

Apoptosis, also known as programmed cell death, is frequently observed in atherosclerotic plaque. Ox-LDL,

Ang II and other stimuli involved in atherogenesis might be playing a role in the process of apoptosis [2–4]. Ox-LDL can induce apoptosis in a variety of cell types, including human coronary artery and umbilical vein endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and macrophages [94–96]. The ox-LDL-induced apoptosis involves downregulation of anti-apoptotic proteins c-IAP-1and Bcl-2, release of cytochrome *c* and Smac, activation of pro-apoptotic signals caspase-9 and caspase-3, and finally induction of apoptosis [96]. The concentrations of ox-LDL required to induce apoptosis are usually >20 μg protein/ml [4]; these concentrations are quite high and seen only in patients with acute coronary syndromes [97]. Low physiologic concentrations of ox-LDL (<5 μg protein/ml) not only do not cause apoptosis, but are associated with endothelial cell proliferation [98, 99]. Reperfusion following tissue ischemia is known to induce apoptosis [100]. This occurs via release of reactive oxygen species during the early stages of reperfusion [101, 102].

In one of our studies [103], we observed that early atherosclerotic lesions (mild to moderate atherosclerosis) show extensive apoptosis when compared to late atherosclerotic (severe atherosclerosis) lesions i.e., the magnitude of apoptosis decreases as the extent of atherosclerosis increases (Fig. 2). We also observed that repeated exposure of endothelial cells to ox-LDL attenuates their subsequent pro-apoptotic response to ox-LDL. This was most likely secondary to altered methylation of pro- and anti-apoptotic genes in the promoter region. Presence of large number of apoptotic cells in the early stages of atherosclerosis may represent a struggle between growing and dying cells whereas decrease in number of apoptotic cells in later stages may suggest a stable process. Thus, strategies that lead to a reduction in atherosclerosis are associated with active programmed cell death (apoptosis being one of them). These concepts suggest apoptosis as a debris removal mechanism in atherosclerosis.

The pro-apoptotic effects of ox-LDL are mediated largely through the upregulation of LOX-1 at transcriptional levels, since pre-treatment of cells with LOX-1 antibody or antisense completely blocks the pro-apoptotic effect of noxious stimuli [104]. Inhibition of LOX-1, by administration of anti-body to LOX-1 or use of LOX-1null mice, significantly diminishes reactive oxygen species release and subsequent apoptosis in the ischemic-reperfused injury to the heart [105].

### Arterial remodeling: role of fibroblasts, extracellular matrix and TGFβ₁

Remodeling implies changes that result in rearrangement of normally existing structures. The remodeling process is generally a response to tissue ischemia or injury wherein

one type of cells (e.g. fibroblast) overtakes the other (e.g. vascular smooth muscle cells).

Arterial remodeling is characterized by fibroblast hyper-trophy, growth, and large amount of extracellular matrix deposition [106–109] in the vascular tissues in an effort to maintain their normal function. But these structural alterations are deleterious over time and ultimately result in loss of normal elasticity of the arterial channels (also known as loss of compliance) [110–112].

During the chronic state, atherosclerotic regions also undergo remodeling; the areas of remodeling are characterized by extensive fibrous tissue and collagen deposits in almost all layers of arterial wall besides accumulation of lipids. Collagen is mainly synthesized by fibroblasts and smooth muscle cells in plaques. The migration and proliferation of smooth muscle cells from the media to the site of an intimal lesion is associated with a net increase in collagen, consequently stabilizing the plaque [113]. The depletion of intimal smooth muscle cell may predispose a plaque to rupture, and plaques associated with unstable angina show increased smooth muscle cell apoptosis [113, 114] Certain atheromatous regions become weak and result in aneurysm formation, while others grow inward and the arterial wall thickens with resultant reduction in arterial lumen. Collagen deposition plays a significant, but undefined, role in both phenomena. It is estimated that approximately 60%–80% of a mature atheroma consists of fibrous and collagen deposits.

The extracellular matrix in adults mainly contains collagen type I and III, also known as fibrillar collagen [115]. Type IV, V and VI form remainder of the extracellular matrix [116]. Several investigators have shown the importance of the ratio between collagen type I and III over the total amount of collagen present. Remodeling leads to a dramatic increase in collagen type III, thus causing a decrease in the type I:III ratio. This indicates that it is the type of collagen and not total collagen that plays an important role in arterial dysfunction [116]. It has been shown that collagen is major component in human atherosclerotic plaque and comprises almost 70% of the entire atherosclerotic region.

The balance between collagen production and degradation under physiologic conditions could be disrupted in several pathologic conditions. For example, anoxia/reoxygenation stimulates the expression of both collagen type I and MMP-1 [117] whereas Ang II enhances the expression of collagen type I, but inhibits the expression of MMP-1 [118]. Collagen deposition in the hearts is clinically relevant since patients whose hearts show pronounced collagen deposition have worse prognosis than those who have less or no significant collagen deposition [97]. Overall, a balance between collagen synthesis and degradation determines plaque stability and arterial stiffness.

Ang II is also a potent stimulus for fibroblast proliferation [119]. Ang II through AT1R receptor enhances reactive oxygen species generation via activation of NADPH oxidases subunit followed by activation of p38 and p44/42 MAPKs. This is followed by NF-kB and AP-1 translocation into the nucleus [120, 121]. These appear to be key steps in the formation of collagen as well as MMPs.

The role of LOX-1 in fibroblast biology became apparent from experiments in which the isolated fibroblasts were transfected with LOX-1 cDNA and then treated with ox-LDL [122]. LOX-1 transfected cells showed markedly increased uptake of dil-labeled ox-LDL (vs. plasmid alone-treated cells). Further, LOX-1 transfected cells showed intense oxidant load and marked increase in the formation of collagen. It is of note that LOX-1 expression in fibroblast

is minimal to absent; however, it is possible that in the in vivo setting, fibroblasts inherit LOX-1 from smooth muscle cells and begin to generate large amount of collagen. In experimental atherosclerosis in the LDLR KO mice, deletion of LOX-1 resulted in a marked reduction in collagen [123]. The collagen accumulation data were corroborated with pro-collagen-1 measurements.

Although initially it was thought that atherosclerotic tissues have small to modest amounts of fibrous tissue, recent experimental studies show extensive dispersion of collagen throughout the atherosclerotic regions where it serves as “cement” holding the proliferating smooth muscle cells and macrophages together. Clinical studies have also shown that the major constituent of the atherosclerotic plaque is fibrous tissue. Statins and PPARγ ligands, particularly in combination, reduce the burden of fibrosis and result in reduction of the size of the plaque in diabetic patients [124]. Expression of osteopontin and fibronectin, which was increased in the wild-type mice was reduced in the LOX-1 KO mice [123]. The enhanced expression of NADPH oxidase (p47<sup>phox</sup>, p22<sup>phox</sup>, gp91<sup>phox</sup>, and Nox-4 subunits) in the wild-type mice was not seen in mice with LOX-1 deletion [123]. Further, phosphorylation of Akt-1 and eNOS and expression of heme-oxygenase-1 were found to be reduced in the wild-type mice, but not in the mice with LOX-1 deletion [123]. These observations provide compelling evidence that LOX-1 plays an important role in enhanced collagen deposition in atherosclerotic regions via pro-oxidant signals.

Transforming growth factor (TGF) is also known to effect changes involved in tissue remodeling. TGFβ<sub>1</sub> is one of the most pleiotropic and multifunctional peptides known [125]. It has been reported that TGFβ<sub>1</sub> can regulate LOX-1 expression in vascular endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and monocytes/macrophages [126, 127]. The suggestion of a role of LOX-1 in the biological effects of TGFβ<sub>1</sub> comes from studies that indicate that TGFβ<sub>1</sub> influences the pro-inflammatory effect of ox-LDL [8, 126, 127]. In these studies, pretreatment of endothelial cells with anti-LOX-1 antibody attenuated the synthesis of TGFβ<sub>1</sub> in response to oxidized low density lipoprotein. Minami et al. [127] provided evidence that TGFβ<sub>1</sub> (0.1–10 ng/ml) induces LOX-1 expression in a transcriptional manner in both bovine aortic endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. Draude and Lorenz [126] described TGFβ<sub>1</sub>-mediated stimulation of ox-LDL uptake in freshly isolated and cultured human monocytes with simultaneous several-fold increase in LOX-1 mRNA. Hu et al. [9] provided with the missing link between TGFβ<sub>1</sub> activation and collagen formation during pro-oxidant states, such as hypertension and ischemia-reperfusion injury. Forced overexpression of TGFβ<sub>1</sub> in

wild-type mouse cardiac fibroblasts induced a 3–4-fold increase in LOX-1 expression. TGFβ<sub>1</sub> up-regulated the expression of LOX-1 and NADPH oxidase, and LOX-1 induced further reactive oxygen species generation and TGFβ<sub>1</sub> synthesis. These observations suggest a positive feedback between TGFβ<sub>1</sub>, NADPH oxidase-mediated generation of reactive oxygen species, and LOX-1 in mouse cardiac fibroblasts. Generation of reactive oxygen species in response to TGFβ<sub>1</sub>-NADPH oxidase-LOX-1 cascade causes activation of MAPKs followed by transcription of redox-sensitive transcription factor/s that induce the genes for collagen. All these observations suggest a link between LOX-1 and TGFβ<sub>1</sub> in the biology of a variety of cell types.

### Unresolved issues in atherosclerosis

Traditional view based on a very limited number of pathologic studies states that fibrotic plaques are stable whereas loss or thinning of fibrous cap or its erosion is associated with a weak plaque that is likely to rupture [111]. This concept is at variance from clinical studies with drugs such as PPAR-γ ligands and statins whose use is associated with reduction in fibrous content, and no increase in the incidence of plaque rupture [124]. Even agents such as aspirin tend to decrease collagen formation probably via their anti-oxidant effect [128], and yet there is no evidence of increase in unstable ischemic syndromes. It is possible that the anti-inflammatory effect of these agents provides a milieu wherein plaque stability is maintained.

### Evidence for the role of LOX-1 in atherogenesis from gene deletion studies

We (56) have provided the conclusive evidence of the role of LOX-1 in atherogenesis. In studies in LOX-1-null mice [56], it was shown that the binding of ox-LDL to aortic endothelium was reduced and endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was preserved following treatment with ox-LDL. In the LDLR-null mouse model of atherosclerosis, the extent of atherosclerosis after 18 weeks of high fat diet was reduced by almost 50% after LOX-1 deletion. Expression of redox sensitive transcription factor NF-κB and the inflammatory marker CD68 was also attenuated in the LDLR/LOX-1 double knockout (KO) mice. On the other hand, anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 expression and SOD activity as well as eNOS expression were preserved in the double KO mice. In the LDLR KO mice, collagen deposition was also significantly reduced with LOX-1 abrogation [56, 129].

Conclusions on the role of LOX-1 in atherogenesis

Oxidized low density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) appears to play key role in atherosclerotic progression and plaque rupture. LOX-1 mediates many of the effects of ox-LDL, i.e. endothelial cell growth, dysfunction, activation and adhesion of monocytes/macrophages; all critical features of atherosclerosis. Ang II, a critical player in atherogenesis, via its type 1 receptor (AT1 receptor) upregulates the expression of LOX-1 mRNA, and ox-LDL via LOX-1 upregulates the expression of AT1 receptors. Activation of both AT1R and LOX-1 receptors via redox signaling leads to cell dysfunction culminating in endothelial apoptosis and injury, monocyte adhesion and activation and eventually atherosclerosis. The mutually facilitatory cross-talk between LOX-1 and AT1 receptors may explain the co-existence of multiple risk factors in the same patient and the increase in atherosclerosis risk with the presence of multiple risk factors.
