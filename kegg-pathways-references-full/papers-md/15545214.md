## Summary

The related disorders of obesity and diabetes are increasing to epidemic proportions. The role of neutral lipid storage and hydrolysis, and hence the adipocyte, is central to understanding this phenomenon. The adipocyte holds the major source of stored energy in the body in the form of triacylglycerols (TAG). It has been known for over 35 years that the breakdown of TAG and release of free (unesterified) fatty acids and glycerol from fat tissue can be regulated by a cAMP-mediated process. However, beyond the initial signaling cascade, the mechanistic details of this lipolytic reaction have remained unclear. Work in recent years has revealed that both hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), generally thought to be the rate-limiting enzyme, and perilipin, a lipid droplet surface protein, are required for optimal lipid storage and fatty acid release. There are multiple perilipin proteins encoded by mRNA splice variants of a single *perilipin* gene. The perilipin proteins are polyphosphorylated by protein kinase A and phosphorylation is necessary for translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet and enhanced lipolysis. Hence, the surface of the lipid storage droplet has emerged as a central site of regulation of lipolysis. This review will focus on adipocyte lipolysis with emphasis on hormone signal transduction, lipolytic enzymes, the lipid storage droplet, and fatty acid release from the adipocyte.

## INTRODUCTION

The main energy storage depots in the body are the triacylglycerols (TAG) found in adipocytes of adipose tissue. The controlled hydrolysis of TAG and release of the products (unesterified or free fatty acids and glycerol) are termed lipolysis. Control of TAG turnover is a highly important metabolic process. Cachexia, the wasting disease found in some cancers and AIDS, and obesity (now at epidemic proportions in the Western world) are the two clear extremes of dysfunctional lipid mobilization or storage. Type II diabetes mellitus is a disease that is increasing in prevalence as obesity increases in the Western world. One of the major risk factors for developing type II diabetes is elevated plasma fatty acids ($l$, $2$), presumably derived from adipose tissue lipolysis. Several lean, yet diabetic, mouse models in which adipose tissue (and hence TAG storage) is dysfunctional further illustrate the role of adipose tissue in the development of type II diabetes. Each of these models has mutations preventing the normal development of adipose tissue (3, 4). Furthermore, studies have established the central role of adipose tissue using agonists of the adipocyte A1 adenosine receptor, which can reverse the symptoms of diabetes in animal models (5, 6) such agonists inhibit adipocyte lipolysis, thus reducing the rate of fatty acid release from adipocytes. Since the adipocyte lipolytic reaction is common to all of these conditions, a better understanding of lipolysis may be beneficial towards laying the groundwork for further advances in treatments for diabetes and obesity.

This brief review will cover lipolysis in the adipocyte beginning with the extracellular chemical signal, following through the signal transduction cascade, to the activation of protein kinase A (cAMP-dependent protein kinase or PKA) and phosphorylation of both hormone sensitive lipase (HSL), the lipase primarily responsible for TAG hydrolysis in adipocytes as well as perilipin, the proteinaceous coating of the lipid storage droplet, and concluding with the export of free fatty acids from the cell.

much of the early work in the Rodbell laboratory that led to
the hypothesis that a transduction mechanism (now known as
G proteins) intervened between hormone receptors and the
adenylyl cyclase target. The catecholamines bind to beta
adrenergic receptors (especially β-3) on the surface of the
adipocyte. This receptor signals through a stimulatory G-
protein (Gαs) to activate adenylyl cyclase. When activated, the
adenylyl cyclase catalyzes the formation of cyclic AMP; it is
also here that the A1 adenosine receptor acts. Adenosine
receptor agonists signal through inhibitory G proteins (Gαi)
that block activity of adipocyte adenylyl cyclase. The cascade
can also be blunted by insulin, which can lower cAMP
concentration by activating phosphodiesterase 3B (7).

The binding of cAMP to the regulatory subunits of PKA
causes their dissociation from the catalytic subunits, leading to
PKA activation. The active catalytic subunits phosphorylate
multiple substrates in the adipocyte, but two have emerged as
more important than the others in lipolysis: hormone sensitive
lipase (HSL) and the perilipins. The A-Kinase Anchoring
Proteins (AKAPs) will localize PKA to specific subcellular
compartments in many types of cells and hence regulate PKA
action. Studies have found that several AKAPs (D-AKAP 1/
S-AKAP 84 and AKAP 121/149) are expressed in adipose
tissue or differentiated adipocytes (8, 9) but what role, if any,
they play in directing phosphorylation of HSL or the perilipins
is presently unknown. There does not appear to be an
adipocyte-specific AKAP, nor could we find evidence for
AKAP localization of PKA subunits near critical PKA
substrates in adipocytes (S. Miura and C. Londos; unpublished).

be catalytically competent to the lipid droplet upon phos-
phorylation.

Experiments with isolated adipocytes reveal a 30–50-fold
increase in lipolysis upon stimulation with β-adrenergic
receptor agonists (isoproterenol), agents that elevate cAMP
(forskolin or isobutylmethylxanthine), or cAMP analogs. By
contrast, *in vitro* phosphorylation of purified HSL with PKA,
yields at best only a 2-fold activation (see refs 13–15 and
discussions therein). This meager stimulation is highly unlikely
to account for the enormous cellular response to PKA
activation (16, 17). Thus, it is not the enzymatic activation
per se of HSL that is central to lipolytic regulation, but rather
it is translocation of HSL to the lipid droplet surface. Animals
in which the HSL gene has been knocked-out are still able to
mount a modest lipolytic response to stimulation, indicating
that another mechanism must exist for the PKA-mediated
increase in adipocyte lipolysis.

THE LIPID STORAGE DROPLET/THE PERILIPINS

In pre-adipocytes or differentiating fibroblasts, lipid dro-
plets are small (on the order of 1–5 microns) and are coated
with ADRP (adipocyte differentiation related protein) (18).
Once differentiated into mature adipocytes, these cells amass
much larger fat droplets, that may comprise 95% of the
volume of the primary adipocytes. While ADRP mRNA
remains elevated during differentiation, perilipin gene expres-
sion ensues and perilipin protein, for reasons still unclear,
displaces ADRP from the droplet surface. Like ADRP,
perilipin is found exclusively on the outer surface of lipid
storage droplets and in no other subcellular compartment
(Fig. 1). Adipocytes express two forms of perilipin, A and B,
distinct products from a differentially spliced mRNA pre-
cursor.

Perilipin A and B are identical through their amino
terminal 406 amino acids, thereupon their sequences diverge.
Concomitant with the phosphorylation of HSL by PKA is
phosphorylation of the perilipins. Perilipin A is phosphory-
lated on up to 6 different PKA sites (aa #81, 223, 277, 434,
492, and 517 in the mouse sequence), whereas perilipin B has
only the three amino terminal PKA sites. Once phosphory-
lated by PKA, perilipin is likely to undergo a conformation
change. This change is observable by fluorescence microscopy
as both a ‘fraying’ of the lipid droplet surface and a
fragmentation of larger droplets into smaller ones (19). These
observations have prompted an exploration of the role the
perilipins play in cAMP-regulated lipolysis. Two approaches
have been employed to study this phenomenon: knockout
mice and tissue culture models.

Two separate laboratories have used homologous recom-
bination in embryonic stem cells to delete the *perilipin* gene in
mouse (20, 21). In both instances the animals were lean,
exhibiting a decrease in adipose tissue mass of approximately
60–70%. This decrease resulted from constitutively high basal

LIPOLYTIC ENZYMES/HORMONE SENSITIVE LIPASE

Hormone sensitive lipase is the enzyme primarily respon-
sible for initiating the hydrolysis of ester bonds at TAG in
both the 1 and 2 positions, the rate-limiting steps in the
breakdown of TAG [for reviews see (10) and (11)]. Hydrolysis
of monoacyl glycerol into free fatty acids and glycerol is
catalyzed by a separate enzyme, the monoacyl glycerol
hydrolase.

HSL is found freely floating in the cytosol of unstimulated
adipocytes and in the cytosolic fraction of adipocyte homo-
genates. Upon stimulation HSL is phosphorylated on several
serines within consensus PKA phosphorylation sites and
translocates to the lipid droplet surface to commence TAG
breakdown. Candidate serines for this phosphorylation
include ser563, ser659, and ser660. Mutational analysis has
revealed that phosphorylation at either ser659 or ser660 is
sufficient to effect HSL translocation; simultaneous mutation
of both sites leads to a loss of translocation, whereas ser563
seems to play no role in lipolysis (12). HSL is a serine esterase
and ser423 lies within the classical catalytic triad of this
enzyme. Mutation of this ser to ala also abrogates the
translocation reaction (12), indicating that the enzyme must

adipocyte lipolysis, which we attribute to the absence of the protective coating of perilipin at the lipid droplet surface. Given the requirement for perilipin in deposition and retention of normal amounts of adipose TAG, the protein may be considered a lipogenic factor. What was surprising was that the perilipin null animals also had a blunted response to stimulated lipolysis, indicating that perilipin was not only acting as a protective barrier in the absence of stimulation, but was necessary to elicit a robust activated response to lipolytic stimuli. Thus, since perilipin is needed to elicit the normal response to lipolytic stimuli that elevate cAMP, it is also a lipolytic factor. These data clearly demonstrate that the previous view that HSL is the sole mediator of stimulated lipolysis and that the substrate is passive is inadequate. Clearly perilipin is an integral player in the lipolytic mechanism and without it, lipolysis cannot proceed normally. More recent studies (discussed at the end of this section) show that at least one of the roles of properly phosphorylated perilipin is to facilitate interaction between the droplet and HSL.

The deletion of perilipin was also able to reverse the obesity found in db/db mice (20), and to prevent the weight gain associated with feeding with a high fat diet (21) but it may not have reversed diabetes in these animals. Animals from the NIH group (21) were found to exhibit an increased level of peripheral insulin resistance as determined by intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (21), and hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp studies (Sztalryd et al.; unpublished). Further, fed glucose and insulin values of perilipin-null mice revealed that nearly twice the amount of insulin was required to maintain euglycemia. This insulin resistance may not be solely due to fatty acids from adipose tissue. Plasma fatty acid levels were paradoxically lower in perilipin-null animals than in their wild type littermates. Perhaps the relative good health of the perilipin-null animals (compared to other 'lipodystrophic' animal models) was due to their increased plasma leptin (21) and adiponectin (Sztalryd et al.; unpublished) levels. A graph of gonadal fat pad mass vs. plasma leptin revealed a curve that was nearly four times steeper for perilipin-null compared to wild type mice. This ameliorative effect of leptin has been observed in other lean lipodystrophic animals as well (22, 23).

To further probe the implications of perilipin phosphorylation and interaction with HSL, tissue culture models were employed. As observed during adipocyte differentiation, perilipin will displace ADRP from lipid droplet surfaces when expressed ectopically in fibroblasts (24) or pre-adipocytes. Indeed, expression of perilipin in cultured fibroblasts causes a dramatic repression of basal lipolytic rates. Further, activation of the PKA pathway in these cells leads to lipolytic activities in excess of those seen in control cells. The Londos (24) and Greenberg (25) laboratories have shown that some combination of the three amino terminal PKA sites (81, 223, 277) of perilipin A are required for optimal lipolytic response. When these sites are mutated and unphosphorylated, lipolysis is inhibited, even in activated cells. Here, expressed perilipin acts as it does in unstimulated cells. Results are disputed for the role of perilipin B, Greenburg and colleagues (26) have

demonstrated a protective role for perilipin B using an adenovirus expression model in 3T3-L1 fibroblasts treated with TNF-alpha to reduce expression of endogenous perilipins. By contrast, Londos et al. (24) expressed perilipin B at physiological levels in a CHO fibroblasts devoid of other perilipins. In this system, perilipin B displaced ADRP, but produced only a minimal protective effect against lipolysis and failed to elicit PKA activation, even though the three amino terminal PKA sites are retained in perilipin B.

Perilipin A appears to block lipolysis by restricting the ability of HSL to associate with the droplet surface (17). Fig. 2 shows our current model for PKA mediated adipocyte lipolysis. By contrast, phosphorylated perilipin A is required for the normal interaction of HSL with the lipid droplet surface. This requirement for perilipin-coated lipid droplets to facilitate HSL translocation was demonstrated in cultured embryonic fibroblasts that had been differentiated into adipocytes. In contrast to cultured adipocytes from wild type animals, those from perilipin-null animals failed to exhibit translocation of HSL under stimulated conditions. This finding was reinforced by a reconstruction of the HSL

translocation reaction in CHO fibroblast expressing perilipin A plus GFP-HSL. GFP-HSL only migrated to lipid droplets upon elevation of PKA activity in cells that also expressed perilipin A on their lipid droplets. In the absence of perilipin A or in the presence of perilipin A in which the 3 most N-terminal PKA sites had been mutated, HSL translocation did not occur. Collectively this work and the gene mutation studies discussed above put forth a new mechanism of lipolysis. Unphosphorylated perilipin may function as a barrier to lipolysis, preventing the interaction of HSL with TAG in the droplet. Phosphorylation of perilipin A at its amino terminus is essential for proper translocation of HSL to the droplet surface; without phosphorylated perilipin A lipolysis does not occur. As evidenced by the perilipin-null mouse, PKA activation elicits only an ~2-fold activation of lipolysis, which probably reflects the meager increase in HSL catalytic activity upon its phosphorylation.

Given that proper phosphorylation of perilipin A in the amino terminus is required for optimal lipolysis, and that in the absence of lipolytic stimuli perilipin A acts as a block to lipolysis, it is intriguing to speculate as to the functional

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 2. Model of PKA-stimulated lipolysis in adipocytes. Lipolysis is initiated by adrenergic stimulation at β adrenergic receptors and activation of adenylyl cyclase (AC), leading to elevation of cAMP and activation of protein kinase A that phosphorylates both HSL and perilipin A. HSL then migrates to the lipid droplet surface and encounters its TAG substrate. The phosphorylated perilipin A undergoes a change in conformation that accommodates the attachment of HSL to the droplet surface.

domains of perilipin and the function of perilipin B. Two groups have now found that it is the amino terminal region of perilipin that provides some measure of control over lipolysis (via phosphorylation), yet perilipin B fails to protect against lipolysis. This indicates that perilipin A may have two distinct functional domains, an amino terminal regulatory domain and a carboxyl terminal inhibitory/activating domain. Whether or not these domains actually exist as functional or physical entities still needs to be established.

Since perilipin B is identical to perilipin A in 406 out of 422 amino acids and yet fails to protect TAG stores from lipolysis or elicit an activation response, it may be that perilipin A is the major regulator of lipolysis and that perilipin B acts only to permit a basal level of lipolysis (a leakiness to the system to provide a constant low level of fatty acids). This may explain the relatively low levels of perilipin B compared to perilipin A.

### LIPID DROPLET TARGETING DOMAINS

The Perilipins are part of an ancient family of proteins (27) that interact with the surfaces of intracellular neutral lipid droplets. Collectively, these have been called the PAT family, after the founding member Perilipin and two other related mammalian proteins ADRP and TIP-47 (27). Family members have been identified in species as diverse as *Dictyostelium discoideum* and *Drosophila melanogaster* (28). They are characterized by conservation through ~250 amino acids of amino-terminal sequence and ability to associate with lipid droplets in homologous and heterologous cells. Distal to the N-terminal conservations, the proteins diverge to varying degrees. Thus, it is likely that the lipid droplet targeting function resides in these N-terminal regions. In support of this hypothesis, structural, but not sequence, conservation has been observed among the PAT proteins and other lipid binding proteins. 11-residue periodicities are detected in the lipid binding region of synuclein and apolipoprotein A-I (apoAI) (29), as well as in the conserved N-terminal region of the PAT family. In contrast to this view, several labs have demonstrated lipid droplet interaction with regions of perilipin (30, 31) and ADRP (32–34) that have been deleted of the 11-mer repeat region. However, each of these artificial protein constructs creates a novel N-terminal alpha helical region that is predicted to be structurally buried in the wild-type protein. Thus, caution must be advised when interpreting the results. The deletion constructs of perilipin and ADRP may present unconstrained amphipathic helices that have an inherently high affinity for lipid domains and that artifactually interact with lipid droplet surfaces. Additional experiments with many various controls are advised before definitive conclusions are drawn.

### FATTY ACID BINDING PROTEIN

Following breakdown of TAG into its constituents (free fatty acids and glycerol) the breakdown products must be removed from the adipocyte. Adipocytes lack glycerol kinase; hence these cell cannot use glycerol as a metabolic precursor. Glycerol is secreted into the circulation and is used by the liver to synthesize glucose (gluconcogenesis). Free fatty acids pose a separate problem. Due to their amphipathic nature they are strong detergents and are toxic to the cell. To counter this, fatty acid binding proteins (FABP) act as chaperones to transport the fatty acids out of the cell (35). In the blood, fatty acids bind to albumin and are transported throughout the circulation to supply energy needs for various tissues.

### CONCLUSIONS

Since adipocytes were first used to elucidate mechanisms of signal transduction great progress has been made in understanding their inner workings. Recent uses of knock-out technology and site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with classical biochemistry, cell biology, and physiology have made it clear that in the adipocyte the lipid storage droplet surface is as important as HSL in providing a controlled lipolytic response. A model now exists in which the phosphorylation of both HSL (on residues 659, and 660) and perilipin A (on some combination of residues 81, 223, and 277) is required for optimal lipolysis following challenge with catecholamine or a beta-adrenergic agonist.

It would be prudent at this point to recognize the existence of mechanisms other than the PKA-mediated process described above in lipolytic regulation. Lafontan and colleagues have shown an ability of atrial natriuretic factors (ANF) to stimulate lipolysis (36). ANFs do not modify cAMP levels, but do stimulate guanylyl cyclase activity to elevate cGMP. Moreover, ANF elevates lipolysis to levels that rival those achieved by cAMP elevation. Yet, HSL does not appear to translocate to lipid droplets upon ANF stimulation. A second mechanism that is also not yet fully understood is the lipolytic response to fasting. Heretofore, this had been thought to be mediated by adrenergic activation. However, mice lacking all three β1, β2, and β3 adrenergic receptors retain a normal response to fasting (37). Thus, the response to fasting remains a mystery. Several studies have proposed various mechanisms by which lipolysis is regulated by the cytokine TNF-alpha. While it is clear that TNF-alpha can regulate lipolysis over the long term by causing changes in gene expression, such as down regulation of PDE 3B (38), Gαi (39), perilipin (26), and HSL, a novel mechanism has emerged wherein TNF-alpha stimulates cAMP production via the MEK-ERK branch of the MAP kinase cascade. While this may contribute to lipolysis, it is likely that the more acute control of lipolysis is regulated via the catecholamine/β-AR receptor pathway described previously.
