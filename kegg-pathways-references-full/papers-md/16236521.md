1. Introducing remarks

During the last years, remarkable progress has been made in the elucidation of the molecular pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemias (AML). This progress has been made possible by the first description of characteristic cytogenetic alterations over a decade ago and by cloning of the participating genes. Later, it was realized that most AML-typical chromosomal alterations cause fusion genes involving transcription factors important

promotes lymphoid or monocytic differentiation depending on its cellular expression level [29–31].

Thus, in order to fully appreciate the contribution of inappropriately activated growth factor receptors and their signaling intermediates to the pathogenesis of AML, it would be important to understand their role in myeloid differentiation. Much less is known about these celltype- and stage-specific functions of signal transduction molecules than about
is complicated by some transcription factors that have a dual function, serving as members of both groups depending on the cell type, in which they are found as well as on their level of expression. Thus, if expressed in early hematopoietic progenitors, Pu.1 can induce B-lymphoid as well as early myeloid differentiation, depending on its expression level [46–48]. Consequently, conditional
close resemblance to the *KIT* gene. However, re-analysis of the intron–exon boundaries revealed three additional exons encoding the first three immunoglobulin-like domains. Thus, the gene is organized in 24 exons, with exons 14 and 15 (and not, as previously thought, exons 11 and 12) encoding the juxtamembrane region
proteins that might be involved in receptor internalization and degradation, but also in mediating the activation of multiple signaling cascades [82–86]. Finally, a weak but consistent phosphorylation of STAT5a, but not STAT5b can be observed after ligand-induced activation of Flt3 [87]. However, this activation is not followed by STAT5 DNA-binding or by expression of STAT5
Fig. 4. Sites of the described activating mutations of Flt3. The diagram depicts the receptor in the autoinhibitory state, before binding of the ligand to the extracellular (EC) part of the receptor that consists of five immunoglobulin-like domains. In the autoinhibitory state, the active center (AC) of the kinase is obstructed by sequences of the juxtamembrane
not observed, if the wildtype juxtamembrane domain is used instead. The heterocomplexes induce constitutive autophosphorylation of the receptor as well as activation of downstream signaling cascades and cytokine-independent growth in Ba/F3 cells. In the same paper, earlier results from the study of Kit mutations were recapitulated showing that insertions as well as deletions in the juxtamembrmyeloid cell line (FDCP1) in vitro and in nude mice [154]. However, later reports failed to show mutations at these sites in series of 50 adult and 91 pediatric AML patients [155,156]. Data from large patient series and functional analyses about the consequences of these mutations on primary bone marrow are not available.

Interestingly, we could identify several RTKs that were highly overexpressed in AML samples if compared with CD34-positive normal hematopoietic progenitor cells [1]. Such data could be used as a basis for screening efforts aimed at the identification of mutations in RTKs that are found to be highly expressed in AML bone marrow.

### 3.1.5.2. Activation of STAT proteins
two genes at the chromosomal breakpoints. Such abnormalities can be detected in more than 50% of newly diagnosed AML cases [203]. The corresponding fusion proteins frequently contain truncated transcription factors joined with another, unrelated protein. Interestingly, the simultaneous occurrence of more than one of these recurrent, balanced translocations is a rare event, providing evidence for a functional redundancy or a common transforming mechanism of these abnormalities. Indeed,
ulocytic differentiation. AML-ETO physically interacts with c/EBPα and thus inhibits its function [212, 221, 223]. In addition, c/EBPα has been shown to be downregulated by AML1-ETO on the transcriptional level [221, 224]. Taken together, AML1-ETO strongly suppresses
is also ample clinical evidence that suggests an essential role of this mechanism for the differentiation block in APL. Systemic administration of all-trans-retinoic-acid (ATRA) induces a rapid differentiating response in the APL patients.

However, overexpression of PML-RARα alone is not sufficient to induce an undifferentiated phenotype in mouse bone marrow. Only 15–20% of the mice
In the last years, several groups reported two types of somatic c/EBPα mutations that occur in about 10% of AML cases with similar frequencies [221,278–280]. The mutations predominantly occurred in cases of the AML FAB M1 or M2 subtypes. Again, the observed differentiation block within the granulocytic lineages fits well with the
looked in. The mutations introduced a stop codon in the full length GATA-1 mRNA, and the shorter protein that is initiated from an alternative ATG further downstream displayed a decreased transactivation potential. However, in other patients with this disease, no such mutations were found [292].

3.2.3. MLL aberrations

The MLL protein, the human homolog of *Dros
rearrangements of the *MLL* gene have been described in AML.

First, partial tandem duplications (PTD) of the *MLL* gene result in a duplication of the 5′ part of the gene. These mutations have been described to occur in 3–10% of adult AML cases. They are not common in pediatric AML. MLL-PTDs are extremely
feedback loops, it seems a more and more difficult task to understand the implications of the activation of single proteins for the development of AML. However, the chances to identify relevant, rate limiting proteins amenable to therapeutic intervention were never as high as today: (1) over the last few years, we discovered undoubtedly aberrant signaling events in more than half of the AML patients, of which the majority can be pharmacologically
