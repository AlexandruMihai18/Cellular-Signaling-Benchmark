### Abstract

Phytopathogenic bacteria use the type III secretion system (TTSS) to inject effector proteins into plant cells. This system is essential for bacteria to multiply in plant tissue and to promote the development of disease symptoms. Until recently, little was known about the function of TTSS effectors in bacterial-plant interactions. New studies dissecting the molecular and biochemical action of TTSS effectors show that these proteins contribute to bacterial pathogenicity by interfering with plant defense signal transduction. These investigations provide us with a fresh view of how bacteria manipulate plant physiology to colonize their hosts.

## INTRODUCTION

Many bacterial pathogens of plants and animals use a conserved TTSS to infect their eukaryotic hosts during pathogenesis (17). For phytopathogenic bacteria in the genera *Pseudomonas, Xanthomonas, Ralstonia, Erwinia,* and *Pantoea*, the TTSS is encoded by the hypersensitive response and pathogenicity (*hrp*) gene cluster. These pathogens use the TTSS within plant tissue at early stages of infection to establish cell-to-cell contact. Once contact is made, the TTSS facilitates the direct secretion and translocation of a diverse group of bacterial proteins, known as TTSS effectors, into host plant cells. Mutant bacteria lacking the TTSS cannot multiply within plant tissue, preventing their colonization and subsequent spread. Thus, the TTSS is a critical virulence determinant for many phytopathogenic bacteria.

Inside the host cell, TTSS effectors are expected to modulate plant physiology in susceptible hosts to sustain the growth of the pathogen outside the cell. Yet virtually nothing is known about the role of TTSS effectors in acquiring or scavenging nutrients from infected plant tissue (Figure 1a). In contrast, much is known about how plants have evolved resistances to combat individual TTSS effectors. The plant innate immune pathway monitors the entry of TTSS effectors into plant cells. Disease resistance proteins of the NBS-LRR class directly or indirectly detect the action of some TTSS effectors [originally referred to as avirulence (Avr) proteins] (74). This leads to the activation of several defense signal transduction pathways that ultimately limit bacterial growth (Figure 1b). Plant responses associated with the recognition of TTSS Avr effectors include the activation of localized cell death classically referred to as the HR (32), the release of reactive oxygen intermediates (57) and nitric oxide (101), the fortification of plant cell walls (9, 12), the production of numerous antimicrobial secondary metabolites and defense-related proteins (24), and the activation of SAR (25).

The precise functions of TTSS effectors have remained a mystery for many years. The ultimate challenge has been to explain how individual effectors contribute to the pathogenic lifestyle of bacteria in susceptible and resistant hosts. There have been significant breakthroughs recently that have increased our understanding of TTSS effector function. These advances have stemmed from seminal investigations revealing that phytopathogenic bacteria deliberately suppress basal defenses (42) and strategically interfere with the activation of disease resistance protein-mediated pathways (41, 84, 86, 98). Moreover, they have come from the development of several model pathosystems (e.g., *Pseudomonas-Arabidopsis, Pseudomonas*-tomato, *Xanthomonas*-pepper, and *Ralstonia-Arabidopsis*), which have been greatly impacted by the recent and near completion of several sequenced genomes.

In this review, I highlight the most exciting advances in elucidating the molecular and biochemical basis of TTSS effector action inside plant cells. We are far from determining all of the plant processes manipulated by TTSS

effectors. However, the investigations de-  
scribed herein provide essential clues that will  
enable new investigations to further dissect the  
intricate interactions that have evolved between  
pathogen TTSS effectors and the host plant  
cellular machinery.  

IDENTIFICATION OF TTSS  
EFFECTORS  

Several approaches have been employed to  
identify TTSS effectors. The first approach  
was to purify proteins secreted into culture flu-  
ids in a TTSS-dependent manner. This led to  
the identification of several proteins including  
harpin (38) and subunits of the TTSS Hrp pilus  
(106). This approach was difficult because low  
concentrations of the effectors are secreted by  
the pathogen in the absence of its host. It was  
also difficult to ascertain if the secreted proteins  
were functioning at the surface of the plant cell  
wall or inside the plant cell.  

At the same time, many groups were busy  
isolating new bacterial Avr proteins and their  
respective plant resistance proteins. The pivotal  
observation that some *avr* genes and *hrp* genes

are coregulated (31, 40, 81) suggested that Avr proteins were TTSS substrates. This was finally confirmed by the development of TTSS translocation assays (14, 71) and in planta transient expression assays (90, 97). These assays were used to prove that Avr proteins, as well as candidate effectors, are translocated into plant cells in a TTSS-dependent manner and are sufficient for the activation of resistance protein-mediated defense responses.

Several researchers suspected that there might be more TTSS effectors in phytopathogenic bacteria. The limitation in finding an Avr effector was discovering rare host plants, mutants, or natural variants, which are resistant to a normally virulent pathogen. Thus, several genome-wide screens were conducted to identify bacterial genes that are coregulated with TTSSs, with the hope of finding new TTSS effectors. Genetic screens using IVET (10) and reporter-based transposons (29, 65) were performed in *P. syringae* while a cDNA-AFLP (76) analysis was done in *X. campestris* pathovar (pv.) *vesicatoria*. The availability of genome sequences for *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* (13), *X. campestris* pv. *campestris* (19), *X. axonopodis* pv. *citri* (19), and *R. solanacearum* (89) enabled researchers to employ computer-based algorithms to identify TTSS substrates. Some of these genomes were specifically mined for orthologs of known TTSS effectors, proteins containing *hrp*-dependent promoter elements implicating coregulation with the TTSS regulon (18, 29, 110), and/or features of N-terminal export-associated signal peptides defined by known TTSS effectors (80). Furthermore, an elegant functional screen was employed in *P. syringae* pv. *maculicola* to isolate TTSS-dependent translocated proteins (34). A similar screen was done in *X. campestris* pv. *vesicatoria* (87), expanding our knowledge of TTSS effectors in this pathogen.

Using all of these approaches, hundreds of TTSS-associated genes have been identified. This indicates that any particular phytopathogen may deploy at least 40–50 TTSS effectors during infection. Consistent with this prediction, more than 40 TTSS effectors have

been experimentally confirmed in *P. syringae* pv. *tomato*. This will likely be true for the other phytopathogens as well. How, then, is this large army of proteins altering plant physiology during bacterial pathogenesis?

## MODE OF EFFECTOR ACTION

It has been known for many years that phytopathogenic bacteria can suppress plant defense responses. For example, *P. syringae* pv. *phaseolicola* strains that cause halo blight in bean suppress the expression of defense genes and the biosynthesis of phytoalexins, inducible antimicrobial compounds (42). This shows that successful growth of bacteria in a plant host is directly correlated with their ability to interfere with plant defense responses. Bacterial interference with host immunity was subsequently linked, in part, to the action of specific TTSS effectors within infected plant cells. In *Arabidopsis*, *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* AvrRpt2 directly interferes with the activation of RPM1-dependent disease resistance triggered by two other effectors, AvrB and AvrRpm1 (84, 86). In specific cultivars of bean, VirPphA suppresses host defenses (41) and AvrPphC masks the ability of AvrPphF to trigger an HR (98). Together, these insightful studies predict that, in addition to other potential virulence roles, a primary role of some TTSS effectors is to directly suppress plant defenses from within the host cell.

The investigations described below support this hypothesis by providing critical molecular evidence for TTSS effector action in planta. The evidence has emerged from the application of a number of approaches, including novel genetic screens, physical interaction studies, protein structure analysis, effector mutagenesis, and plant gene expression profiling.

## Suppressors of Programmed Cell Death

The recent study of *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* AvrPtoB (homolog of VirPphA) shows that this effector directly interferes with the Pto disease resistance pathway in *N. benthamiana* by

operating as a general PCD suppressor (1). Both AvrPtoB and AvrPto interact with the tomato Pto serine/threonine kinase (51). Pto-mediated recognition of AvrPtoB and AvrPto in tomato activates a Prf-dependent signal transduction pathway that leads to disease resistance (79). Coexpression of AvrPto and Pto in *N. benthamiana* activates HR, indicating that the Pto-mediated defense pathway is conserved in this host. Surprisingly, coexpression of AvrPtoB and Pto fails to activate HR in *N. benthamiana*. This suggests that AvrPtoB might act as a specific suppressor of the Pto defense pathway in *N. benthamiana* but not in tomato. In fact, expression of AvrPtoB in *N. benthamiana* is sufficient to block the HR triggered by a constitutively activated mutant Pto kinase (1). Deletion analysis of AvrPtoB shows that the N- and C-terminal domains are sufficient for Pto recognition and anti-PCD activity, respectively. AvrPtoB suppression activity in *N. benthamiana* is not restricted to the Pto defense pathway. AvrPtoB also inhibits HR triggered by the tomato Cf-9 resistance protein in *N. benthamiana* in response to the *Cladosporium fulvum* peptide elicitor Avr9 (1). Taken together, these data show that Avr-

PtoB functions downstream of disease resistance proteins to suppress the HR (Figure 2).

Given that PCD is associated with many cellular processes in eukaryotes (33, 56), Abramovitch and colleagues also explored the possibility that AvrPtoB may be a general cell death inhibitor. They found that AvrPtoB protects plants from HR-like PCD induced by Bax, a proapoptotic protein in the Bcl-2 family that initiates PCD in animal cells (1). Furthermore, AvrPtoB protects yeast cells from stress-induced PCD mediated by hydrogen peroxide, menadione, and heat shock, but curiously not Bax (1). It is not clear how AvrPtoB mediates such cross-kingdom PCD protection because we currently know very little about the machinery that regulates PCD in plants (56). However, AvrPtoB inhibition of PCD in both plants and yeast suggests that different eukaryotic PCD pathways may be regulated by conserved mechanisms.

AvrPtoB and four additional *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* effectors were subsequently shown to suppress HR responses triggered by another effector, HopPsyA (43). This was demonstrated by infecting tobacco plants with a

**PCD:** programmed cell death

nonpathogenic *P. fluorescens* strain carrying pHIR11 and a broad host range vector expressing individual TTSS effectors. pHIR11 contains the *P. syringae* pv. *syringae* TTSS *hrp* gene cluster and the HopPsyA effector. *P. fluorescens* expressing pHIR11 genes elicited a HR in tobacco in a TTSS- and HopPsyA-dependent manner. Expression of AvrPtoB, AvrPphE<sub>Pto</sub>, AvrPpiB1<sub>Pto</sub>, HopPtoE, or HopPtoF (an AvrPphF homolog) in *P. fluorescens* (pHIR11) completely suppressed HopPsyA-dependent HR and, with the exception of AvrPpiB1<sub>Pto</sub>, the expression of the pathogenicity-related gene *PR1*. Transient expression of each effector in planta also protected plant cells from HopPsyA-induced HR, demonstrating that HR suppression occurs within the plant cell.

Suppressor activity for some effectors was not restricted to HopPsyA-induced PCD. AvrPphE<sub>Pto</sub>, HopPtoE, HopPtoF, and HopPtoG inhibited PCD induced by Bax in plants and yeast. Unlike AvrPtoB, these effectors could not protect yeast from hydrogen peroxide stress. The fact that *P. syringae* uses a number of effectors to suppress PCD in plants triggered by different internal and external cues suggests that this pathogen may have evolved distinct suppressor activities to inhibit PCD at different stages of plant infection. Is this phenomenon unique to *P. syringae*? Or is the suppression of PCD a central requirement for bacterial pathogenesis? Identifying the mechanism(s) of PCD suppression is the next challenge.

### Activators of the JA Pathway

A growing body of literature indicates that pathogens modulate the SA, JA, and ET defense pathways in different ways to colonize their hosts (54). This is confounded by the fact that these pathways influence each other by a complex series of positive and/or negative interactions. For instance, plant SA and JA pathways are mutually antagonistic (54). Bacterial pathogens, in particular *P. syringae*, have exploited this fact to overcome SA-dependent defenses. SA-dependent signaling pathways play a critical role in establishing local and systemic resistance to some phytopathogenic bacteria (25). However, activating JA-dependent signaling, a pathway that is typically induced in response to herbivores and wounding, negatively regulates the expression of SA-dependent defenses, rendering plants more susceptible to bacterial attack (26, 30, 107). The recent study of mutants in the SA and JA pathways provides insight to how bacterial pathogens use TTSS effectors, as well as the phytotoxin COR, to co-opt SA-dependent immune responses.

Hints that *Pseudomonas* strains may activate the JA pathway came from studying COR. COR is a nonhost-specific, chlorosis-inducing polyketide sharing structural similarity with JA and methyl-JA (8). The structure of COR suggested that it might activate the JA pathway and thereby inhibit or delay SA-mediated defenses (85). Consistent with this hypothesis, tomato and *Arabidopsis* plants with an intact JA signal transduction pathway are sensitive to the effects of COR, whereas JA-insensitive tomato (*jai1*) and *Arabidopsis* (*coi1*) mutants do not respond to COR and exhibit enhanced resistance to *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* (52, 107). JAI1 and COI1 encode homologous F-box proteins that are expected to be part of a functional E3 ubiquitin ligase. This E3 ligase is predicted to regulate the expression of JA-responsive genes by ubiquitinating repressors of the JA pathway, an event that would promote their degradation by the proteosome (23). Treatment of wild-type tomato plants with exogenous methyl-JA is sufficient to complement a virulence defect of a *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* strain defective in COR production (107). This shows that a functional tomato JA-dependent signaling pathway is necessary and sufficient for susceptibility to wild-type *P. syringae* pv. *tomato*. It also strongly supports the hypothesis that COR contributes to *Pseudomonas* pathogenicity by mimicking endogenous jasmonate (Figure 3).

Several lines of evidence suggested that COR is not the only *Pseudomonas* factor manipulating the JA pathway. First, COR-deficient mutants produce small necrotic lesions in tomato even though they do not grow as efficiently as wild-type *P. syringae* pv. *tomato*.

AR242-PP56-20  ARI  28 March 2005  20:7

**Figure 3**

*Pseudomonas syringae* pv. *tomato* uses the phytotoxin coronatine (COR) and TTSS effectors to activate the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway and thereby inhibit or delay salicylic acid (SA)-mediated defense responses in plant cells.

However, the same COR deficient mutants do not produce visible lesions in *jai1* tomato plants, even though their growth in leaves is comparable to that of wild-type bacteria (107). This indicates that bacterial growth alone is not sufficient for disease development and that unknown bacterial factors and a competent JA signaling pathway are required for plant susceptibility. Second, both COR and a functional TTSS are required for *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* to induce JA response genes and repress PR genes in susceptible tomato plants (107). This shows that the TTSS and/or its effectors modify JA and SA signaling networks (Figure 3).

The development of a transgenic *Arabidopsis* reporter line that specifically monitors both COR and the TTSS during *Pseudomonas*-plant interactions led to the identification of five TTSS effectors that augment the JA pathway (37). It was discovered that COR and the TTSS are required for *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* to induce the early expression of RAP2.6, an *Arabidopsis* ET response factor gene, in a COI1-dependent manner. This indicated that RAP2.6 expression could serve as a reporter to assess the influence of individual TTSS effectors on JA signaling during infection (37). Compared to wild-type *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* strains, mutants lacking *hopPtoK* or *avrPphE<sub>pto</sub>* poorly induced the expression of a RAP2.6 promoter-luciferase reporter gene in transgenic *Arabidopsis*, while strains expressing an additional effector (*AvrB*, *AvrRpt2*, or *AvrPphB*) accelerated the timing and magnitude of the reporter expression (37). None of the five effectors was alone sufficient to activate RAP2.6 expression, indicating that a combination of pathogen factors is required to adequately manipulate the JA pathway.

Finally, it is intriguing that virulent *P. syringae* strains actively suppress *Arabidopsis NHO1*, a gene required for general resistance to nonhost and avirulent isolates of *P. syringae* (66). Suppression of *NHO1* was abolished in *coi1* mutants, demonstrating that JA signaling also mediates this interaction (48). Constitutive overexpression of *NHO1* relieved plants from pathogen suppression, resulting in enhanced plant disease resistance. It is currently unknown which pathogen factors suppress *NHO1* expression, although PAMPs (e.g., flagellin, DNA,

www.annualreviews.org • TTSS Effector Function in Plant Pathogenesis 515
or LPSs) are suspected (66). It is also not clear how NHO1 contributes to plant immunity. NHO1 encodes a glycerol kinase, which is a rate-limiting enzyme in glycerol metabolism that converts glycerol to glycerol 3-phosphate (66). It is tempting to speculate that altered glycerol metabolism may affect the cellular pools of lipids, molecules recently linked to many facets of plant disease resistance (28, 45, 47, 69).

**Suppressors of Plant Cell Wall Remodeling**

Early microscopic studies revealed that plant hosts infected with the TTSS mutant but not wild-type phytopathogenic bacteria can remodel their cell walls, resulting in the formation of thick protrusions known as papillae (9, 12). Hauck and colleagues (36) elegantly determined the TTSS factors that prevent plant cells from mounting such cell wall-based defenses. Using cDNA microarray analysis, they set out to define a host gene expression profile that reflects the virulent functions associated with the *P. syringae* pv. tomato TTSS. They identified a large set of *Arabidopsis* genes that were repressed in a SA-independent and TTSS-dependent manner (36). These genes encode or are predicted to encode secreted cell wall and defense proteins, including extensions and germin-like proteins, two known components of papillae. This is the first molecular evidence showing that the TTSS is globally suppressing extracellular plant processes in addition to papillae formation (36). The nature of the *Pseudomonas* component that triggers plant cell wall remodeling is not clear, although LPS produced by *X. campestris* pv. *vesicatoria* induces a similar response in pepper (50).

Hauck and colleagues showed that the *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* effector AvrPto is one of the pathogen factors capable of suppressing papillae formation (36). This was demonstrated using a transgenic *Arabidopsis* line expressing AvrPto. Expression of AvrPto in planta prevented the host from appropriately responding to a *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* TTSS secretion mutant. These plants failed to deposit callose, a component of papillae. As a result, the TTSS mutant grew but failed to induce water-soaking symptoms or necrosis in leaves (36). In addition, the AvrPto-expressing plants exhibited a gene expression profile remarkably similar to that of plants infected with the pathogen (36). Surprisingly, an *avrPto* bacterial mutant was also capable of modulating the same set of TTSS-regulated genes in *Arabidopsis*. Together, these data provide direct evidence that AvrPto functionally mimics TTSS-dependent phenotypes elicited by the pathogen in the natural context of a plant infection. It also reinforces the fact that additional TTSS effectors are required to suppress plant cell wall defenses and to promote disease symptoms.

Two additional *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* effectors were characterized as suppressors of plant cell wall–based defenses. DebRoy and colleagues (20) showed that both HopPtoM and AvrE suppress callose deposition in *Pseudomonas*-infected *Arabidopsis* plants. These proteins along with HopPtoA1 and HrpW are encoded by the conserved effector locus (CEL), a gene cluster that is widely conserved among diverse *P. syringae* pvs. (3). CEL deletion mutants (∆CEL) are severely impaired in virulence in tomato (3). It is now clear that this loss in virulence is due primarily to the action of HopPtoM and AvrE. Importantly, HopPtoM and AvrE can each suppress SA-dependent cell wall defenses (20). This is distinct from the SA-independent suppression of cell wall defenses mediated by AvrPto described above. *Arabidopsis* microarray analysis showed that the CEL locus does not suppress the classic SA-responsive defense genes activated by disease resistance proteins (20). This indicates that HopPtoM and AvrE are specific suppressors of basal SA-dependent plant defense responses. Importantly, this mechanism of suppression promotes host cell death, an event that is critical for the development of disease necrosis. Analysis of the AvrE ortholog, DspA/E, in the CEL of *E. amylovora* confirms that DspA/E also acts as a suppressor of cell wall–based defenses in *Erwinia*-apple
interactions (20). This suggests that deployment of HopPtoM and AvrE-like suppressors may be a conserved virulence strategy used by many phytopathogens to overcome basal plant defenses.

**Activators of Plant Transcription**

Members of the AvrBs3 effector family are highly related and are found in many *Xanthomonas* spp. (60). In several susceptible *Xanthomonas*-plant interactions, AvrBs3-like effectors are actively involved in promoting disease symptoms. For example, AvrBs3 from *X. campestris* pv. *vesicatoria* induces hypertrophy of pepper mesophyll cells (70), PthA from *X. citri* elicits canker lesions in citrus (93), AvrXa7 from *X. oryzae* contributes to lesion length in rice (7), and Avrb6 from *X. campestris* pv. *malvacearum* increases water soaking in cotton leaves (105). These distinct phenotypes are mediated by strikingly similar polypeptides containing highly conserved N- and C-terminal domains and a variable central domain comprised of tandem repeats. All members possess three NLSs and an AAD in their C terminus, suggesting that they function in the plant nucleus to modulate plant transcription during infection. Consistent with this hypothesis, AvrBs3, Avrb6, AvrXa7, and PthA possess functional NLSs (99, 103, 104) and the AAD of AvrXa10 activates transcription in yeast and *Arabidopsis* (109). Interestingly, AvrBs3 uses one of its NLSs to interact with importin α, a component of the nuclear import machinery (95, 96). This suggests that AvrBs3, and possibly other members of this family, may hijack a ride into the plant nucleus via importin α. The set of plant genes directly regulated by each AvrBs3 family member has yet to be defined. However, AvrXa7 preferentially binds to dA/dT-rich double-stranded DNA sequences (103) and AvrBs3 induces the expression of auxin-induced expansin-like genes in pepper (70). Taken together, these data strongly suggest the AvrBs3 effector family functions in the plant nucleus to alter transcription. Determining if the effectors directly or indirectly interact with the

plant transcription machinery is still a major question.

**Suppressor of Resistance Protein Activation**

The *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* AvrRpt2 effector plays many elusive roles in plant cells. However, it is clear that one of its roles in establishing *Pseudomonas-Arabidopsis* interactions is to directly suppress the activation of the RPM1-dependent disease resistance pathway. A wealth of new genetic and biochemical evidence suggests that AvrRpt2 interferes with RPM1 activation by functioning as a cysteine protease (5, 6, 67). Details supporting the biochemical basis of AvrRpt2's function are described in detail below.

**BIOCHEMICAL ACTIVITY AND HOST TARGETS**

Critical insight to TTSS effector enzymatic function recently emerged from the investigation of five effector families: XopD, YopJ, YopT, AvrRpt2, and HopPtoD2. By employing protein structure prediction programs, researchers identified unique protein folds and conserved catalytic residues buried within these proteins. In doing so, they elucidated that some TTSS effectors encode enzymes with distinct catalytic activities. These discoveries allowed researchers to test the mechanism of effector action and to dissect how individual effectors activate resistance protein-mediated defense signal transduction.

**XopD and YopJ SUMO Protease Families**

The prevalence of YopJ-like TTSS effectors in pathogenic bacteria prompted Orth and colleagues to investigate whether these molecules use a conserved mechanism to alter host physiology during infection. Using CPH models and Threader to predict protein structure, they found that YopJ from *Y. pseudotuberculosis* and AvrBsT from *X. campestris* pv. *vesicatoria*

resemble cysteine proteases in the C55 protease family (78). Consistent with this protease assignment, the predicted catalytic core of YopJ is required for the inhibition of MAPK and NF-κB signaling in animals. Similarly, the predicted core of AvrBsT is required for activating HR in resistant plants (78). This supported the hypothesis that these effectors encode cysteine proteases, but the nature of the host substrates was still a mystery. Upon further inspection, Orth and colleagues showed that YopJ-like effectors share limited structural similarity with the yeast ubiquitin-like protease ULP1, a cysteine protease in the C48 family (61). This was a pivotal observation because it revealed that TTSS effectors might interfere with the SUMO conjugation pathway in both animal and plant cells.

SUMO is a small ubiquitin-like modifier that is posttranslationally linked to proteins by a conjugation system analogous to the ubiquitin conjugation system (46) (Figure 4). ULPs function as SUMO proteases that reversibly control the attachment of SUMO to protein substrates. First, as peptidases, ULPs cleave SUMO after the C-terminal sequence (-GG-XXX) generating the mature form (-GG). Then the terminal glycine forms an isopeptide bond with the epsilon amino group of a lysine residue in a protein substrate. Second, as isopeptidases, ULPs cleave the isopeptide bond, releasing SUMO from SUMO-protein conjugates. YopJ (78), AvrBsT (A. Hotson & M.B. Mudgett, unpublished), and X. campestris pv. vesicatoria AvrXv4 (88) reduce the accumulation of SUMO-protein conjugates in host cells, suggesting that each protein possesses isopeptidase activity in vivo. However, enzymatic activity has not yet been detected for purified recombinant protein.

Direct biochemical evidence demonstrating that TTSS effectors act as SUMO proteases came from the study of the X. campestris pv. vesicatoria effector XopD (39). Unlike YopJ-like effectors, XopD shares significant structural homology with ULPs, classifying it as a cysteine protease in the C48 family. Biochemical analysis of XopD showed that the protein encodes a constitutively active cysteine protease with SUMO peptidase and isopeptidase activity. Furthermore, XopD cleaves tomato SUMO and not mammalian

SUMO, demonstrating that XopD's substrate specificity is plant-specific. The fact that XopD, AvrBsT, and AvrXv4 primarily disrupt protein sumoylation in planta suggests that the primary role of these TTSS effectors is to interfere with plant pathways regulated by SUMO (Figure 4).

Which SUMO-protein conjugates are targeted by pathogen SUMO proteases? More importantly, how does interference with SUMO posttranslational modification contribute to bacterial pathogenicity? We await the answers to these questions. A recent report shows that a diverse array of sumoylated proteins exists in plants and that some of these are isoform-specific (55). In *Arabidopsis*, the SUMO pathway consists of at least eight SUMO isoforms and twelve SUMO proteases. These data suggest that numerous protein signal transduction pathways in plants may be controlled by SUMO, in an isoform- and protease-dependent manner. So far in plants, SUMO has been linked to pathogen attack (35), abiotic stress (55), abscisic acid signaling (64), and flowering time (73). In other eukaryotes, SUMO controls many diverse cellular processes including nuclear transport, enzyme activity, transcription, and the cell cycle (46, 100). Thus, pathogens could potentially target numerous SUMO-protein conjugates, possibly disrupting many cellular events. Elucidating effector substrate specificity will be a significant biochemical challenge.

The plant subcellular localization of pathogen SUMO proteases might provide hints to possible host targets. For instance, XopD (39) and PopP2, a YopJ-like effector from *R. solanacearum* (21), are targeted to the plant nucleus whereas AvrXv4 appears to be restricted to the plant cytoplasm (88). Physiological partitioning of ULPs has been reported in yeast. ULP1 is confined to the periphery of the nuclear membrane while ULP2 is dispersed throughout the nucleus (62). The noncatalytic N-terminal domain of ULP1 controls its localization, restricting it to a subset of sumoylated proteins not accessible to ULP2 (63). Interestingly, XopD also contains an N-terminal regulatory domain that controls its nuclear

targeting (39) and isopeptidase substrate specificity (Hotson and Mudgett, unpublished). Thus, it appears that phytopathogens may target distinct effectors to different cellular compartments to mimic the plethora of endogenous SUMO proteases found in plants. This is consistent with the fact that *Xanthomonas* (4, 16, 75, 77, 102) and *Ralstonia* (21, 58, 59) inject multiple SUMO protease-like effectors into plant cells during infection.

Some plants have evolved resistance proteins to recognize YopJ-like effectors. The *Arabidopsis* RRS1 protein provides resistance to strains of *R. solanacearum* expressing PopP2 (22). RRS1 physically interacts with PopP2 in yeast (21), suggesting that the molecular recognition of PopP2 *in planta* is direct. RRS1 is an atypical resistance protein that codes for a TIR-NBS-LRR protein with a WRKY domain (22). WRKY domains are primarily found in plant transcription factors. Thus, it is intriguing that cytoplasmic RRS1 moves into the plant nucleus in the presence of PopP2 (21). This implies that RRS1 trafficking to the nucleus might activate the transcription of defense genes in response to PopP2. Given the importance of SUMO in transcriptional regulation (46, 100), it is imperative to molecularly link RRS1 function with PopP2 virulence activity *in planta*. Positional cloning projects are currently underway to identify the molecular basis of AvrXv4 and AvrBsT resistance in tomato (4) and *Arabidopsis* (Wilson and Mudgett, unpublished), respectively. Recognition of these effectors will likely be indirect since protease catalytic core mutants do not elicit a HR in resistant hosts (78, 88).

### YopT Cysteine Protease Family

To explore the function of the *Yersinia* TTSS effector YopT, Shao and colleagues used multiple PSI-Blast iterations to identify homologous proteins in the available genome databases (92). They discovered a large effector family with at least 19 members conserved among pathogenic bacteria that infect animal or plant cells, including two plant symbionts. The predicted
secondary structure of each member identified structural conservation surrounding three invariant residues (Cys/His/Asp) that are found in the catalytic core of cysteine proteases in the C58 family. The protease assignment for this family was confirmed upon the release of the crystal structure of AvrPphB from *P. syringae* pv. *phaseolicola* (108). As predicted, AvrPphB's core structure closely resembles that of papain-like cysteine proteases. More importantly, the solved structure defined substrate-binding residues in AvrPphB that are divergent in the other YopT family members. This predicts that each member will display different substrate specificities, dictated by the proteins encountered during host invasion. So far this appears to be true seeing that AvrPphB and YopT target distinct proteins in plant and animal cells, respectively (91, 92).

The genetic and molecular dissection of the AvrPphB-dependent *RPS5* disease resistance pathway in *Arabidopsis* supported a protease role for AvrPphB and provided clues to candidate plant substrates. First, the fact that AvrPphB is proteolyzed in the pathogen (83) suggested that AvrPphB might encode a protease that cleaves itself as well as host substrates. Second, the cleavage of AvrPphB and AvrPphB-dependent activation of the *RPS5* disease resistance pathway requires a functional AvrPphB protease catalytic core (92). This clearly indicated that proteolysis of AvrPphB is autocatalytic and that AvrPphB-dependent cleavage of a plant substrate is required for activation of *RPS5* signal transduction. Third, *RPS5*-mediated resistance requires the PBS1 protein kinase possessing autophosphorylating activity (94), suggesting that PBS1 itself is the target of AvrPphB.

Based on these observations, Shao and colleagues exquisitely showed that PBS1 is an AvrPphB substrate (91). *In vitro*, constitutively active AvrPphB cleaves itself and recombinant PBS1 after the sequence 'Gly-Asp-Lys', a motif that defines enzyme specificity. Furthermore, AvrPphB physically interacts with PBS1 *in planta* cleaving it into two polypeptides. Curiously, PBS1 kinase activity is not required for its

cleavage by AvrPphB; however, PBS1 cleavage and PBS1 kinase activity are both required for the activation of *RPS5*. Together, these studies suggest a novel mechanism for the activation of *RPS5*-mediated disease resistance. The model proposes that a phosphorylated PBS1 cleavage product, possibly in a complex with AvrPphB, binds to and activates *RPS5*. Such a protein complex is expected to reside at the host plasma membrane considering that upon entry into the plant cell AvrPphB is immediately fatty acylated and trafficked to the plasma membrane (Figure 5).

At present, it is unclear how AvrPphB protease activity contributes to bacterial pathogenesis. Elucidating the function of PBS1 in plant cells and/or isolating additional AvrPphB substrates should reconcile this matter. In comparison, YopT protease activity explains in part its cytotoxic role during *Yersinia* pathogenesis. The YopT protease cleaves the carboxy termini of lipid-modified Rho GTPases releasing the prenyl moieties that anchor them to the host plasma membrane (92). This irreversible inactivation of Rho GTPases leads to the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and impairs mammalian cells from properly executing phagocytosis and bacteria internalization. Although plants lack Rho GTPases, they have maintained a subfamily of Rho-related GTPases (ROPs), some of which are linked to plant defense responses (2). It is thus tempting to speculate that, in addition to PBS1, AvrPphB may also target ROPs during bacterial-plant interactions.

### **AvrRpt2 Cysteine Protease**

The AvrRpt2 protein is a unique effector found only in *P. syringae* pv. *tomato*. AvrRpt2 is translocated into plant cells where it is amino-terminally processed into two polypeptides (72). The C-terminal AvrRpt2 polypeptide is sufficient to activate defense signal transduction in plants containing the *RPS2* resistance protein. In addition, AvrRpt2 surprisingly triggers an *RPS2*-independent disappearance of RIN4 (6, 67), a novel protein required for RPM1-mediated disease resistance (68). This

prompted Axtell and colleagues to suspect that AvrRpt2 encodes a RIN4 protease. Using the 3D-PSSM structure prediction program, they established that the AvrRpt2 protein contains a catalytic core with structural folds similar to staphopain, a cysteine protease in the C47 family (5). Consistent with this prediction, AvrRpt2 catalytic core mutants prevent the cleavage of AvrRpt2, the degradation of RIN4, and the activation of RPS2 (5). This strongly suggests that AvrRpt2 cleavage *in planta* is autocatalytic and that RIN4 is an AvrRpt2 substrate. Moreover, this supports other experimental evidence that the activation of RPS2 is coupled to the disappearance of RIN4 (6, 67) (Figure 6). Despite much effort, there is no direct evidence that AvrRpt2 possesses protease activity or that RIN4 is its substrate. This may be due to the fact that AvrRpt2 cleavage, an event that likely activates this protease, requires a plant factor (44). Identification of this elusive factor is expected to reveal the mechanisms for AvrRpt2 activation and substrate cleavage.

The AvrRpt2-dependent elimination of RIN4 and interference with RPM1 activation suggests that one of AvrRpt2's virulence functions is to suppress the early steps in defense signal transduction. In the absence of AvrRpt2, two other effectors, AvrRpm1 and AvrB, trigger the RIN4-RPM1 defense cascade during *Pseudomonas* infection. AvrRpm1 and AvrB physically interact with RIN4 *in planta*, an event that leads to RIN4 phosphorylation and the activation of RPM1 at the plasma membrane (68). In the presence of AvrRpt2, RIN4 is degraded (6, 67); therefore RPM1 remains inactive because it cannot associate with RIN4 at the plasma membrane (68). Thus, AvrRpt2 appears to subvert the host’s recognition of AvrRpm1 and AvrB, allowing the invading pathogen to go unnoticed in an *rps2* genetic background.

AvrRpt2 protease activity explains how AvrRpt2 interferes with RPM1 signal transduction. Still, it does not explain how AvrRpt2 independently contributes to *Pseudomonas* pathogenicity (15). AvrRpt2 increases *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* pathogenicity in *Arabidopsis* plants lacking *rps2* and *rin4* (111). This indicates that AvrRpt2 likely has plant targets in addition to RIN4. The identification and characterization of AvrRpt2 host susceptibility factors should resolve the role of AvrRpt2.

in *Pseudomonas*-plant interactions. The exciting finding that AvrRpt2 modulates free auxin levels within bacterially-infected plants gives us a new clue as to how AvrRpt2 may promote pathogen growth and disease formation (53).

**HopPtoD2 Protein Phosphatase**

By employing BLAST and 3D-PSSM analysis, two groups established that the *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* HopPtoD2 encodes a novel, modular TTSS effector (11, 27). The N terminus of HopPtoD2 is homologous to the N terminus of AvrPphD, an effector from *P. syringae* pv. *phaseolicola*. The C terminus of HopPtoD2 exhibits a predicted protein fold conserved in many protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs). This suggests that HopPtoD2 encodes a chimeric AvrPphD-PTP effector with two potential functions. Biochemical analysis of purified, recombinant HopPtoD2 confirms that the PTP domain encodes a tyrosine phosphatase. HopPtoD2 hydrolyzes the artificial PTP substrate para-nitrophenyl phosphate and two phosphotyrosine-containing peptides derived from the insulin and EGF receptors

(11, 27). No serine phosphatase activity was detected. Thus, HopPtoD2 is a tyrosine-specific protein phosphatase.

The precise role of HopPtoD2 in planta is not known; however, it clearly plays an important role in *Pseudomonas*-host interactions. In susceptible interactions, *P. syringae* pv. *tomato* *hopPtoD2* mutants exhibit reduced growth in *Arabidopsis* and tomato (11, 27). Optimal pathogen growth requires HopPtoD2 phosphatase activity (27), indicating that this effector is required for pathogenicity. In otherwise resistant interactions, HopPtoD2 phosphatase activity in planta decreases hydrogen peroxide production and *PR1* expression (11) and blocks the induction of the HR in plants infected with avirulent *P. syringae* strains lacking HopPtoD2 (11, 27). HopPtoD2 phosphatase activity also suppresses the HR induced in *N. benthamiana* by ectopic expression of NtMEK2<sup>DD</sup>, a constitutively active mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-signal-regulated kinase (ERK) involved in plant defense signaling (27). Together, these studies indicate that HopPtoD2 prevents plants from mounting a defense response against other injected

TTSS effectors and suggests that HopPtoD2 dephosphorylates a substrate downstream of NtMEK2 in the MAPK pathway (Figure 7). Further dissection of MAPK cascades controlling PCD associated with plant immunity and plant susceptibility (82) should identify key targets for HopPtoD2 and possibly other TTSS effectors.

Note that PTP sequences appear to be limited to a few *P. syringae* spp. whereas AvrPphD sequences are widely distributed in *P. syringae* spp. and distantly related phytopathogenic bacteria (11, 27). This suggests that sequences encoding PTP domains may have been recently acquired by *P. syringae* genomes, directly or indirectly creating the chimeric HopPtoD2 effector. Similar protein phosphatases are present in the animal pathogens *Yersinia* (YopH) and *S. typhimurium* (SptP). Interestingly, SptP is a chimeric effector containing GTPase-activating protein activity and PTP activity in its N- and C-terminal domains, respectively (49). Further study of HopPtoD2 should provide insight to its evolution and the possibility that it may encode one polypeptide with two virulence activities.

**CONCLUDING REMARKS**

These investigations have greatly deepened our understanding of how phytopathogenic bacteria use TTSS effectors to colonize plant tissue. We now have molecular and biochemical evidence that several TTSS effectors contribute to pathogenesis by targeting distinct plant processes that are required for disease resistance. Specifically, TTSS effectors interfere with resistance protein activation, repress the SA pathway by activating the JA pathway, modulate plant transcription, and suppress cell wall-based defenses as well as the execution of PCD. In addition, we have new insight to some of the biochemical signatures used by TTSS effectors to manipulate these pathways. TTSS effectors interfere with the regulation of host proteins by mimicking the activity of plant proteases and phosphatases. Modification of host targets may be reversible considering the biochemical mechanism of the XopD/YopJ-like SUMO proteases and the HopPtoD2 phosphatase, or irreversible, considering the destruction imposed by the YopT and AvrRpt2 cysteine proteases.

Despite this progress, a clear link has not yet established between the mode of

www.annualreviews.org • TTSS Effector Function in Plant Pathogenesis 523

effector action and its biochemical properties. Several effectors manipulate plant defenses, but the biochemical mechanisms are not known, whereas others obviously encode enzymes but their host substrates and mode of action remain to be determined. Future challenges will be to decipher the mechanism by which TTSS effectors, independently and/or collectively, manipulate plant signal transduction pathways during bacterial pathogenesis. Identifying additional substrates and pathways targeted by pathogens will be essential.

**SUMMARY POINTS**

1. Molecular evidence shows that individual TTSS effectors suppress plant innate immunity by interfering with resistance protein activation, MAPK signaling, and the execution of PCD.
2. TTSS effectors cooperate to suppress SA-dependent and SA-independent plant cell wall-based defenses.
3. TTSS effectors work with the phytotoxin COR to activate the JA pathway in order to down-regulate SA-mediated defenses.
4. Four TTSS effector families encode cysteine proteases, indicating that proteolysis of host proteins is a conserved mechanism used by phytopathogenic bacteria to manipulate plants.
5. The biochemical activity of TTSS effectors shows that pathogens can reversibly and irreversibly manipulate plant signal transduction.

**FUTURE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED**

1. What is the biochemical function and mode of action for each TTSS effector?
2. What is the timing and order of effector injection into plant cells? Does it matter?
3. How do so many TTSS effectors contribute to the coevolution of bacterial-plant interactions?
