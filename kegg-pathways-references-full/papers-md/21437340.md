Biotin is an enzyme cofactor indispensable to metabolic fixation of carbon dioxide in all three domains of life. Although the catalytic and physiological roles of biotin have been well characterized, the biosynthesis of biotin remains to be fully elucidated. Studies in microbes suggest a two-stage biosynthetic pathway in which a pimelate moiety is synthesized and used to begin assembly of the biotin bicyclic ring structure. The enzymes involved in the bicyclic ring assembly have been studied extensively. In contrast the synthesis of pimelate, a seven carbon α,ω-dicarboxylate, has long been an enigma. Support for two different routes of pimelate synthesis has recently been obtained in *Escherichia coli* and *Bacillus subtilis*. The *E. coli* BioC-BioH pathway employs a methylation and demethylation strategy to allow elongation of a temporarily disguised malonate moiety to a pimelate moiety by the fatty acid synthetic enzymes whereas the *B. subtilis* BioI-BioW pathway utilizes oxidative cleavage of fatty acyl chains. Both pathways produce the pimelate thioester precursor essential for the first step in assembly of the fused rings of biotin. The enzymatic mechanisms and biochemical strategies of these pimelate synthesis models will be discussed in this review.

### Introduction

Biotin (also known as vitamin B7) is an essential vitamin. The physiologically active form of biotin is an enzyme-bound prosthetic group that carries carbon dioxide in many metabolic carboxylation, decarboxylation and transcarboxylation reactions. Since its discovery in 1901, biotin came to be known by several different names. As biotin, it was identified as a growth factor for yeast. It was also isolated as a curative factor for egg-white injury in rats and called protective factor X and vitamin H. Biotin was also named coenzyme R in its role as a factor that stimulated growth of rhizobia. The true identity of biotin finally emerged when du Vigneaud and coworkers succeeded in purifying biotin and determining its structure. Since then the enzymatic role of biotin has gradually become clear as biotin-dependent enzymes were identified in fatty acid synthesis, amino acid metabolism and gluconeogenesis across all three domains of life.

The role of biotin as a stable carboxyl group carrier is facilitated by its structure which consists of a bicyclic ring attached to a valeryl side chain (Fig. 1). The bicyclic rings are comprised of a ureido ring fused to a tetrathiophene ring. Biotin is covalently attached to its cognate enzymes via an amide bond between the carboxyl group of biotin and the ε-amino group of a specific lysine residue of a conserved protein domain of 70–80 residues. Thus the biotin valeryl side chain extends the bicyclic rings away from the lysine residue. The protruding biotin moiety together with the rugby ball shaped biotinylated protein domain form an elongated swinging arm that shuttles CO₂ equivalents between the carboxylation and carboxyltransfer domains of the enzyme. The ureido ring N8 nitrogen carries the CO₂ moiety and forms N-carboxybiotin upon reaction with a carboxy donor molecule thought to be carboxyphosphate produced by ATP activation of bicarbonate (Fig. 1). The ureido ring is essentially planar whereas the tetrathiophene ring has the sulfur atom pointing out of the plane. The overall structure resembles a slightly reclining chair with the ureido ring as the back of the chair and the tetrathiophene ring as the seat. The geometry of the bicyclic rings helps to prevent the N8 nitrogen from achieving the tetrahedral geometry required for decarboxylation, making N8 carboxybiotin a much more stable carbamate than monocyclic or acyclic carboxylureas. Decarboxylation is triggered by rotation of the carboxy group out of plane of the ureido ring. This enzyme-mediated rotation provides proper polarization to weaken the bond and to release carbon dioxide in the carboxyl transfer reaction.

The structure and chemistry of biotin and its physiological roles are now well understood, however, we still lack a complete understanding of biotin biosynthesis in any biotin-producing organism. Biotin biosynthesis is limited to microbes, fungi and plants. Mammals are incapable of biotin synthesis and obtain biotin from the diet and/or intestinal microflora.

pimelate moiety and assembly of the bicyclic rings. Until recently little was known about pimelate synthesis whereas the enzymes of ring assembly have been well characterized. Supplementation with pimelic acid (α,ω-heptanedioic acid) has been known to stimulate biotin production in certain fungi and bacteria. However, most biotin-producing organisms are unable to convert pimelic acid to biotin and contain unusual pathways for *de novo* synthesis of pimelate moieties. The synthesis of pimelate (Fig. 1) which contributes most of the biotin carbon atoms (including the valeryl side chain) is catalyzed by at least two different pathways. The best understood pathways, the *E. coli* BioC–BioH pathway and the *B. subtilis* BioI–BioW pathway, are discussed in detail later in this review. The intermediate between the first and second stages of biotin synthesis is a pimelate thioester linked to either CoA or acyl carrier protein (ACP). The thioester linkage is not only essential for pimelate synthesis but also provides the activated intermediate required in the subsequent synthesis of 8-amino-7-oxononanoate (AON, also known as 7-keto-8-aminopelargonic acid). In contrast to the diversity seen in pimelate synthesis, the assembly of the bicyclic rings in all known biotin biosynthetic pathways is evolutionarily conserved and the enzymes share nearly identical chemistry. In a four-step pathway, a pimelate thioester is first converted to AON. The pathway then proceeds through two more intermediates—7,8-diaminononanoate (DAN, also known as 7,8-diaminopelargonic acid) and dethiobiotin (DTB)—to form biotin (Fig. 1). All of the *E. coli* enzymes involved in assembly of the bicyclic rings have known X-ray crystal structures and are well studied mechanistically. We shall first discuss these enzymes.

### AON synthase (BioF)

The first step in the assembly of the bicyclic rings is the conversion of the pimelate thioester to AON by AON synthase (AONS) encoded by the *bioF* gene. AONS is a pyridoxal 5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme of subclass II of the aminotransferase family and has the conserved active-site architecture of PLP-dependent α-oxoamine synthases. Each monomer of the homodimeric AONS resembles an open left hand with the thumb being the flexible N-terminal domain, the heel being the C-terminal domain and the remainder of the palm and fingers representing the central domain. The PLP cofactor is covalently attached to a conserved lysine residue through an imine linkage and participates as both proton acceptor and donor in the reaction. Several positively charged residues thought to facilitate binding of the acidic groups of CoA (or ACP) surrounding the active site. AON is formed in a decarboxylative condensation reaction between L-alanine and a pimelate thioester with concomitant release of CO₂ and cleavage of the thioester bond. This reaction follows standard Schiff base chemistry. In the presence of the substrate, L-alanine, an alanine-bound external aldimine complex is formed and rearranged into a quinonoid intermediate by the binding of the second substrate, pimelate thioester. The second half reaction is in principle the reversal of the first half reaction. The quinonoid intermediate is converted back to the lysine-bound internal aldimine that subsequently attacks the thioester carbonyl forming a 3-oxoacid

Fig. 1 The second stage of biotin biosynthesis, the assembly of the bicyclic rings, consists of four reactions catalyzed by 8-amino-7-oxononanoate synthase (AONS), 7,8-diaminononanoate synthase (DANS), dethiobiotin synthase (DTBS) and biotin synthase. Pimelate thioester is a dedicated precursor of the second stage of the biosynthetic pathway and provides the majority of the biotin backbone carbon atoms. The R group indicates either CoA or acyl carrier protein (ACP). Biotin is covalently attached to a specific lysine residue of biotin-dependent protein by biotin protein ligase. The ureido ring N8 atom carries the CO₂ moiety. Abbreviations: SAM, S-adenosyl-L-methionine; AMTOD, S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-thiomethylbutyrate; 5′-DOA, 5′-deoxyadenosine.

The structures of the late intermediates in the pathway were determined as the result of the extensive genetic studies on biotin-requiring mutants of *Escherichia coli* initiated by Eisenberg, Campbell and their coworkers in the late 1960s. This foundation greatly facilitated molecular and biochemical studies of the biotin biosynthetic enzymes that allowed the fascinating chemistry of biotin biosynthesis to be unraveled. In this review, we will summarize our current understanding of biotin biosynthesis which originates mainly from studies done in *E. coli*, *Bacillus subtilis* and *Bacillus* (now *Lysinibacillus*) *sphaericus*.

### The biotin biosynthetic pathway

Comparative genomic analysis indicates that the biosynthetic pathway is largely conserved among biotin-producing organisms and can be readily divided into two stages, synthesis of a

aldimine complex.²⁸ The synthesis of AON is completed by decarboxylation of the 3-oxoacid aldimine intermediate back into the quinonoid species and reformation of Schiff base linkage between PLP and the lysine residue.²⁸ The end result of the AONS reaction is the extension of the seven carbons of pimelate with two carbon atoms and a nitrogen atom derived from L-alanine which become the C8, C9 and N8 moieties of biotin.

### DAN synthase (BioA)

The next step in the pathway is transamination of AON at C7 to produce DAN. The DAN synthase (DANS which is encoded by the bioA gene) of E. coli, B. sphaericus and Mycobacterium tuberculosis surprisingly use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the amino donor.²⁹⁻³² This is the only known example of the use of SAM, a common methyl donor, as an amino donor. The product of deamination, S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-thiomethylbutyrate, spontaneously degrades *in vitro*³³ and thus it seems likely that the three ATP equivalents required to synthesize SAM are consumed in what is an otherwise simple transamination reaction. B. subtilis DANS avoids this seemingly profligate loss of an expensive activated intermediate by using a more mundane amino donor, lysine.³⁴ Like AONS, DANS is a PLP-dependent enzyme belonging to the subclass III aminotransferase family.³³ Each subunit of this homodimeric enzyme consists of a small N-terminal domain essential for dimerization and a large β-sheet rich central domain where the critical PLP-binding lysine residue is located.³⁵ The striking similarity of the amino acid sequences, the overall structures and active site architectures of AONS and DANS suggests that the two enzymes are evolutionarily related and possibly derived from a common ancestor.³⁶,³⁷ Therefore it is not surprising that the DANS reaction is mechanistically similar to the AONS reaction. The first half reaction proceeds through a transaldimination process from which an external aldimine complex is formed between SAM and PLP.³⁵ The external aldimine complex is rearranged to a quinonoid intermediate before being processed through a ketimine intermediate to give S-adenosyl-2-oxo-4-thiomethylbutyrate and pyridoxamine phosphate. In the second half reaction, DAN accepts the amino group from pyridoxamine phosphate and the enzyme-bound PLP complex is restored.³⁵ The result is the introduction of the N7 amino group essential for formation of the ureido ring.

### DTB synthase (BioD)

The penultimate step of biotin biosynthesis is the conversion of DAN to DTB by DTB synthase (DTBS which is encoded by the bioD gene). This enzyme catalyzes a mechanistically unusual reaction, the ATP-dependent insertion of CO₂ between the N7 and N8 nitrogen atoms of DAN to form an ureido ring. Thus DTBS represents an enzymatic carboxylation mechanism distinct from those of biotin-dependent carboxylases and ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase.³⁸ Each subunit of the DTBS homodimer is composed of seven parallel β-sheets interconnected by α-helices with the active sites located at the dimer interface.³⁸ Similar to ATP- and GTP-binding proteins,

DTBS contains a classical P-loop motif (Gly-X-X-Gly-X-Gly-Lys-Thr/Ser) that binds the nucleotide phosphate groups.³⁹ The carboxylation reaction catalyzed by DTBS consists of three steps. The first step is the regiospecific formation of carbamate at N7 of DAPA through reaction with CO₂, a highly coordinated event at the enzyme active site.³⁸,⁴⁰ The enzyme initiates nucleophilic attack of the N7 nitrogen by polarizing CO₂ and abstracting a proton from the N7 nitrogen. The resulting carbamate intermediate is partially buried in the enzyme rendering it inaccessible to the solvent and is further stabilized by a number of hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions (Fig. 2).³⁸ Stabilization of the carbamate allows the reaction to proceed even at low CO₂ concentrations. The second step is formation of carbamic-phosphoric anhydride by nucleophilic attack of the ATP γ-phosphate by the carbamate oxygen atom.⁴¹ The final step is the closure of the ureido ring and release of inorganic phosphate. This last step awaits further clarification. The proposed mechanism begins with nucleophilic attack at the carbamate carbon by N8 to form a tetrahedral intermediate (Fig. 2).³⁸ To complete formation of the ureido ring, the carbon-oxygen bond is cleaved to release inorganic phosphate and the N8 nitrogen is deprotonated by a nearby base, possibly a Glu12 residue or a phosphate oxygen atom (Fig. 2).³⁸

### Biotin synthase (BioB)

The final step of biotin biosynthetic pathway is the insertion of a sulfur atom at the C6 methylene and C9 methyl groups of DTB to form a tetrathiophene ring. This reaction is catalyzed by biotin synthase (encoded by the bioB gene) whose intriguing SAM-dependent radical chemistry, despite extensive research, is still not fully understood. Active biotin synthase is a homodimeric iron–sulfur enzyme. Each monomer has the fold of a triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) type (α/β)₈ barrel containing a surface exposed, air-sensitive [4Fe–4S]²⁺ cluster and a deeply buried, air-stable [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster.⁴²,⁴³ The topology of biotin synthase resembles the general architecture of SAM radical enzymes; however, the location of the iron–sulfur clusters in the TIM barrel is unusual hinting at a design for unique chemistry. The [4Fe–4S]²⁺ cluster is essential for radical generation.⁴² This cluster is located at the top of the TIM barrel far from the dimer interface and is coordinated by a CxxxCxxxC motif conserved in SAM radical enzymes.⁴³,⁴⁴ The fourth ligand to this cluster is the substrate SAM which binds a specific Fe atom *via* its amino nitrogen and carboxyl oxygen (Fig. 3).⁴³ SAM binding is greatly enhanced by the presence of DTB which becomes sandwiched between SAM and the [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster.⁴³ The [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster is deeply buried at the bottom of the barrel⁴³ and is the source of sulfur atom for tetrathiophene ring formation as verified by labeling studies with isotopes of sulfur⁴⁵ and selenium.⁴⁶

The biotin synthase reaction consists of three main steps: the SAM-dependent abstraction of hydrogen from DTB, the derivation of sulfur atom from the [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster and a complex regeneration of active enzyme that is poorly understood. Although a complete mechanism awaits further biochemical studies, the proposed reaction begins with transfer of an electron from reduced flavodoxin, *via* the [4Fe–4S]²⁺

Fig. 2 The reaction scheme of DTBS, which catalyzes the ATP-dependent insertion of CO₂ between the N7 and N8 nitrogen atoms of DAN to form the ureido ring, is modified from Huang *et al.*³⁸ The regiospecific carboxylation of N7 produces a carbamate intermediate which is held in place *via* a number of ionic and H-bonding interactions particularly involving the ε-amino groups of residues Lys15 and Lys37. The carbamate intermediate and the γ-phosphate group of ATP are aligned in the active site for nucleophilic attack on the phosphorus atom, an event possibly facilitated by Lys37 which stabilizes the resulting negatively charged carbonyl oxygen. Upon deprotonation of N8 by residue Glu12 or one of the phosphate oxygen atoms, the formation of the ureido ring is complete.

cluster, to the SAM sulfonium (Fig. 3).⁴⁷ The one-electron reduction of the sulfonium group spontaneously generates methionine and a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical which is required for C–H bond homolytic cleavage and abstraction of a hydrogen atom from the C9 methyl group of DTB.⁴⁸ This reaction produces a carbon radical at C9 which attacks the bridging sulfide of the [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster, yielding a [2Fe–2S]²⁺ linked DTB intermediate (Fig. 3).⁴² A second 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical generated by the same reduction mechanism abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C6 methylene group, producing another carbon radical that attacks the same [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster sulfur atom.⁴⁸ Insertion of the sulfur atom at C6 and C9 of DTB creates the tetrathiohene ring and consequently destroys the [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster.⁴⁹ The biotin synthase reaction also requires Mtn, a 5′-methylthioadenosine/S-adenosylhomocysteine nucleosidase to cleave 5′-deoxyadenosine to alleviate product inhibition.⁵⁰

The sacrifice of the [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster for sulfur insertion renders biotin synthase inactive after each round of catalysis. This explains why biotin synthase has generally been reported to catalyze only a single turnover per subunit *in vitro*, although evidence for multiple turnovers has very recently been reported.⁵¹ To achieve multiple turnovers, the reconstitution of the [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster must be considered as an obligatory part of catalytic cycle. Reconstitution of the deeply buried [2Fe–2S]²⁺ cluster is not an easy process. Some researchers have proposed that biotin synthase might have evolved to be a stoichiometric substrate rather than an enzyme.⁴³ However, *in vivo* biotin synthase is capable of up to 20 turnovers where Fe–S cluster assembly systems such as the Isc and Suf systems are available.⁴³,⁵² Moreover the regeneration of biotin synthase requires partial unfolding of the protein, mediated by HscA, a molecular chaperone of the Hsp70 family which renders biotin synthase susceptible to proteolysis and eventual degradation.⁵²⁻⁵⁴ Since the biological requirement for biotin is so low (~100 molecules per cell in *E. coli*),⁵² continuous synthesis of biotin synthase could readily compensate for its short half-life.

### Synthesis of the pimelate moiety

Until very recently little was known about the synthesis of the biotin pimelate moiety and much of the available literature was only conjecture. Using radioactive pimelic acid, Eisenberg and colleagues demonstrated direct incorporation of the acid into biotin by the fungi *Phycomyces blakesleeanus*⁵⁵ and *Penicillium chrysogenum*.⁵⁶ These workers proposed

Fig. 3 The proposed reaction of biotin synthase begins with the reduction of sulfonium group of SAM by transferring an electron from reduced flavodoxin via the [4Fe–4S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster. This reduction generates methionine plus a 5′-deoxyadenosyl radical (5′-DOA•) that abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C9 methyl group of DTB. The C9 carbon radical attacks the bridging sulfide of the [2Fe–2S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster. A second 5′-DOA radical is then generated which abstracts a hydrogen atom from the C6 methylene group. The C6 carbon radical attacks the same sulfur atom of the [2Fe–2S]<sup>2+</sup> cluster resulting in the insertion of a sulfur atom between C6 and C9 atoms and the formation of the tetrathiophene ring of biotin. This figure is adapted from the reviews by Jarrett<sup>83</sup> and Lotierzo *et al.*<sup>84</sup>

a mechanism of incorporation in which pimelic acid was activated via a thioester linkage to CoA to give pimelyl-CoA.<sup>57</sup> Pimelyl-CoA would then be converted into AON by AONS in a reaction analogous to the synthesis of δ-aminolevulinic acid from glycine and succinyl-CoA.<sup>58</sup> The enzymatic formation of AON from pimelyl-CoA and L-alanine was subsequently demonstrated in cell-free extracts of *E. coli*, suggesting that pimelate could serve as an entry point into biotin biosynthesis.<sup>57</sup>

In 1994 two groups reported studies tracing the origin of the *E. coli* biotin carbon atoms by <sup>13</sup>C-NMR.<sup>59,60</sup> The <sup>13</sup>C-NMR spectra of biotin extracted from *E. coli* cultures grown on acetate differentially labeled with <sup>13</sup>C indicated that three intact acetate units are incorporated into the pimelate moiety of biotin. The labeling pattern matches the head-to-tail condensation pathways of fatty acid and polyketide syntheses. The C3, C5 and C7 carbon atoms of pimelate are derived from C1 of acetate whereas the C2, C4 and C6 are derived from C2 of acetate (Fig. 1). The C1 of pimelate could be labeled with both [1-<sup>13</sup>C]- and [2-<sup>13</sup>C]-acetate suggesting that the carboxyl group originated from <sup>13</sup>C-CO₂ produced by the citric acid cycle and subsequently fixed into malonyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase.<sup>59,60</sup> The labeling patterns demonstrated that the two carboxyl groups of pimelate are metabolically distinct, thereby ruling out the symmetrical pimelic acid as a biotin synthetic intermediate in *E. coli*.<sup>60</sup> Moreover, these studies

eliminated other plausible sources of pimelate from oxidation of octanoate, by elongation of 2-oxoglutarate or derivation from the tryptophan, lysine or diaminopimelate pathways. However, the patterns precisely matched those predicted by the model of biotin synthesis put forth in 1963 by Lynen and coworkers in which pimelyl-CoA synthesis was postulated to proceed by a head-to-tail condensation process mechanistically similar to fatty acid synthesis.<sup>61</sup> In that model three molecules of malonyl-CoA would be coupled by two successive rounds of fatty acid synthesis to produce pimelyl-CoA (Fig. 4). This reaction sequence would retain the ω-carboxyl group of the primer malonyl moiety such that odd numbered carbon chains would be produced. This model has a precedent in type III polyketide synthesis in which the synthases catalyze decarboxylative Claisen condensations of multiple malonyl-CoA molecules to form long chain ω-carboxylacyl-CoA species (Fig. 4).<sup>62</sup> The oxo groups introduced by the Claisen condensations are retained or remodeled in subsequent cyclization reactions of the carbon chain to form the final polyketide (Fig. 4). In contrast the synthesis of pimelyl-CoA by the Lynen pathway requires that the oxo groups become fully reduced to methylene groups, by the reduction and dehydration reactions of fatty acid synthesis.

The Lynen model of pimelyl-CoA synthesis raised three major biochemical challenges. First, fatty acid synthesis utilizes

Fig. 4 Decarboxylative Claisen condensation with malonyl-ACP (or CoA) is common to fatty acid synthesis, type III polyketide synthesis and in the proposed model of pimeloyl-CoA synthesis. However, these pathways differ significantly with respect to the processing of the internal oxo groups. In fatty acid synthesis, the oxo group is eliminated by a series of reduction-dehydration-reduction reactions whereas in type III polyketide synthesis (using DpgA as an example), the oxo groups are retained or remodeled during the subsequent cyclization of carbon chain. The proposed model of pimeloyl-CoA synthesis from condensation of three molecules of malonyl-CoA would produce an oxo group at each of the two chain elongation steps which must be eliminated in order to produce pimeloyl-CoA.

ACP as a carrier rather than CoA which is generally associated with the fatty acid degradation pathway (ACP was unknown when the Lynen proposal was put forth). If pimelate is synthesized as an ACP thioester, either an acyl transfer reaction would be required to transfer the pimelate moiety from ACP to CoA for AON synthesis or pimeloyl-ACP must be an AONS substrate. A serious challenge to the model is the presence of the ω-carboxyl group. In the initiation step of normal fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA is condensed with malonyl-ACP by 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase (FabH) to give acetoacetyl-ACP, the methyl end of which is derived from the primer acetyl moiety (Fig. 4). In contrast, the Lynen model would result in a negatively-charged, hydrophilic ω-carboxyl group derived from the primer malonyl moiety in place of the hydrophobic methyl group. The ω-carboxyl group would be poorly tolerated, if not totally occluded, from the hydrophobic active sites of the fatty acid synthetic enzymes. The final challenge is the preservation of the ω-carboxyl group of the 3-oxoglutaroyl intermediate. Prior to reduction of the 3-oxo group the ω-carboxyl group would in theory be prone to spontaneous decarboxylation and therefore might require stabilization.

The BioC-BioH pathway of E. coli  

The isotopic labeling data mentioned above plus the extensive genetic analyses of its biotin synthetic pathway made E. coli the obvious choice to approach the question of how the pimelate moiety might be assembled using the fatty acid synthetic pathway. Another advantage was that the fatty acid synthetic pathway of this bacterium has been studied in great detail. Genetic studies in E. coli identified bioC and bioH as the only genes with unassigned functions essential for biotin biosynthesis. Strains having inactive bioC or bioH genes require biotin for growth but biotin can be replaced by AON or any of the later pathway intermediates indicating that the bioC and bioH gene products catalyze reactions required for AON synthesis. Moreover, neither bioC nor bioH mutant strains excrete any detectable intermediate suggesting that the intermediates of pimelate synthesis might be protein bound. Various workers had proposed confusing and contradictory pictures of the roles of BioC and BioH in biotin biosynthesis. BioC was hypothesized to actively catalyze the condensation of malonyl-CoA or to function as an ACP dedicated to

pimeloyl-CoA synthesis; 63 whereas BioH was proposed to act as an acyltransferase that transferred the pimeloyl moiety from BioC to CoA. 64 It was also proposed that BioH could function as a pimeloyl-CoA synthetase and somehow attach pimelic acid to CoA perhaps with the help of BioC. 65 However, these models not only lacked supporting data but also failed to address the fundamental problems of how α,ω-dicarboxylic acyl chains are assembled.

The missing pieces of the puzzle were found in BioC and BioH. The primary sequence of BioC showed SAM binding motifs that are well conserved in the SAM-dependent methyltransferase family, although no methyltransferase activity had been demonstrated. On the other hand, BioH had been shown to have carboxylesterase activity of broad substrate specificity. BioH hydrolyzes the ester bonds of short acyl chain p-nitrophenyl esters 64,65 and also the methyl ester of dimethylbutyryl-S-methyl mercaptopropionate, a precursor of the cholesterol-lowering agent, Simvastatin. 66 Moreover, the BioH X-ray crystal structure showed a catalytic triad (Ser82, His235, Asp207) often found in hydrolase superfamily enzymes. 65 A BioH:CoA complex was also observed when purified BioH was incubated with excess of CoA. 67 These attributes of BioC and BioH made the assignment of their functions in biotin biosynthesis puzzling. Why does E. coli biotin biosynthetic pathway require a SAM-dependent methyltransferase when the origins of all biotin carbons are known and none originates from methionine? Why is an esterase required when pimelate assembly must require a series of elongation reactions?

A model in which E. coli BioC and BioH hijack fatty acid synthetic enzymes for biotin biosynthesis was recently proposed. 68 In this model BioC and BioH do not directly catalyze the synthesis of pimelate but instead they provide the means to allow fatty acid synthesis to assemble the pimelate moiety (Fig. 5). Such circumvention of the normal fatty acid synthesis pathway involves O-methylation and demethylation events and produces pimeloyl-ACP, instead of pimeloyl-CoA, as the AON synthetic precursor. In this model which has recently received strong in vivo and in vitro support, 65 BioC (a putative O-methyltransferase) converts the ω-carboxyl group of malonyl-CoA into a methyl ester by transferring a methyl group from SAM. The shielding of the carboxyl group by conversion to a methyl ester neutralizes the negative charge and provides a methyl carbon that mimics the methyl ends of normal fatty acyl chains. The malonyl-CoA methyl ester then enters the fatty acid synthetic pathway where it is condensed with malonyl-ACP by a 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase to give 3-oxoglutaroyl-ACP methyl ester, an intermediate stabilized by the methyl ester moiety. The methyl ester shielding allows the 3-oxo group to be processed into a methylene group by the standard fatty acid reductase-dehydratase-reductase reaction sequence (Fig. 5). The glutaryl-ACP methyl ester product would then be elongated to the C7 species and another round of the reductase-dehydratase-reductase cycle would give pimeloyl-ACP methyl ester. Given the hydrophobicity of the active sites of the fatty acid synthetic enzymes, the methyl ester moiety would remain essential throughout this process. Once synthesis of the pimeloyl chain is complete, the methyl ester moiety is no longer required and is removed to terminate chain elongation. The termination reaction is catalyzed

Fig. 5 The proposed E. coli BioC–BioH pathway for the synthesis of pimelate is comprised of three main steps. The initiation step is catalyzed by BioC O-methyltransferase which transfers a methyl group from SAM to the ω-carboxyl group of malonyl-CoA, to give malonyl-CoA methyl ester, a primer dedicated to biotin biosynthesis. The second step is the chain elongation cycle of fatty acid synthesis using ACP as the acyl chain carrier. The methyl ester moiety allows elongation of a malonyl chain to a pimeloyl chain after two cycles of synthesis. Once the desired chain length is achieved, BioH terminates chain elongation by cleaving the methyl ester moiety to produce pimeloyl-ACP, a substrate for AONS in the second stage of biotin biosynthesis. Abbreviation: SAH, S-adenosylhomocysteine.

by BioH which hydrolyzes the methyl ester bond to expose the ω-carboxyl group to prevent further elongation by the fatty acid synthetic enzymes (Fig. 5). AONS converts pimeloyl-ACP into AON, the first intermediate in assembly of the bicyclic rings of biotin. Note that the AONS reaction could provide an equally effective termination of the chain elongation process due to cleavage of the thioester linkage between pimeloyl chain and ACP. BioC has not yet yielded a crystal structure. This is probably due to the extreme tendency of BioC proteins to form inclusion bodies upon high-level expression in E. coli. 67,68 However, the present authors have recently found a tractable BioC that hopefully will yield a crystal structure.

## The BioI–BioW pathway of B. subtilis

B. subtilis is the only organism other than E. coli in which we have an understanding of how the pimelate moiety is synthesized. However, the genetic and biochemical analyses of this pathway are not as well developed as in E. coli. B. subtilis is thought to have two routes to obtain pimelate thioesters,

Fig. 6 $B$. subtilis BioI is a cytochrome P450 enzyme (CYP107H) that catalyzes oxidative cleavage of the acyl chain. (A) The interactions of BioI with ACP and 4′-phosphopantetheine group (PPant) provides the regiospecificity needed for precise cleavage of C7–C8 bond. In the crystal structure ${ }^{76}$ of BioI in complex with $E$. coli hexadec-9Z-enoyl-ACP (PDB code 3EJD), the acyl chain adapts a U-shaped conformation with C7 and C8 atoms becoming situated at the bend of the “U” immediately above the heme iron. The U-shaped tunnel extends beyond the heme group to accommodate varying acyl chain lengths. For simplicity only a ribbon diagram is shown. However, numerous BioI–ACP contacts involving salt bridges between acidic residues of ACP and basic residues of BioI are found. In addition a number of hydrogen bonds are formed by backbone amide groups of several non-polar residues of both ACP and BioI. ${ }^{76}$ (B) Precise cleavage of the C7–C8 bond, independent of the acyl chain length, produces pimeloyl-ACP and a monocarboxylic acid from the methyl end. Each arrow indicates oxidation, but the stoichiometry of these reactions is not known. Color codes: blue, ACP; yellow, 4′-phosphopantetheine group; green, hexadec-9Z-enoate; red, heme; orange, iron; grey, BioI. It should be noted that the cleavage of acyl-ACPs has not yet been shown to be catalytic.

pimeloyl-CoA synthetase encoded by the bioW gene and an enzyme of the cytochrome P450 family encoded by the bioI gene. ${ }^{69}$ Pimeloyl-CoA synthetase allows $B$. subtilis to incorporate exogenous pimelic acid into the biotin biosynthetic pathway. Homologous enzymes have also been characterized in Bacillus megaterium, ${ }^{70} B$. sphaericus ${ }^{71}$ and Pseudomonas mendocina. ${ }^{72}$ However the origin of pimelic acid (or pimeloyl-CoA) remains elusive because the molecule is neither found in central metabolism nor is abundant in known environments. The only reported source of pimeloyl-CoA is benzene degradation by Rhodopseudomonas; ${ }^{73}$ however other biotin-producing organisms lack this pathway suggesting the existence of pimelate biosynthetic pathway(s) dedicated for biotin synthesis.

In contrast, BioI is believed to provide de novo synthesis of pimeloyl-ACP by catalyzing oxidative C–C bond cleavage of long chain acyl-ACPs (Fig. 6). ${ }^{74}$ Like other cytochrome P450 enzymes, BioI uses the cysteine-ligated active site heme to activate O₂ by two flavodoxin-mediated reductions with NAD(P)H to produce one equivalent of the Fe(v)-oxo species and a H₂O molecule. ${ }^{74}$ The highly reactive Fe(v)-oxo species is responsible for acyl chain C–C bond cleavage, although several cycles of oxidation are needed to achieve cleavage. ${ }^{75}$ The first intermediate is thought to be a monohydroxylated acyl chain which upon further oxidation would become a vicinal diol. A third round of oxidation would cleave the vicinal diol. Although free fatty acids can be processed by BioI in vitro, acyl-ACPs are thought to be the physiological substrates. ${ }^{74,75}$ No ω-oxidation of fatty acid by BioI was observed, ruling out the possibility of direct conversion of octanoyl-ACP to pimeloyl-ACP.

The regiospecificity of BioI oxidation of long chain acyl-ACPs is attributed to the enzyme active site architecture and interaction of the protein with ACP. Both are important in dictating the position of oxidative cleavage. Expression of the bioI gene in $E$. coli resulted in a portion of the BioI protein being found in complexes with 14- and 18-carbon acyl-ACPs. ${ }^{74}$ The recent elegant crystal structures of BioI–acyl-ACP complexes show that the fatty acyl chain together with the 4′-phosphopantetheine prosthetic group is inserted into the BioI substrate pocket with ACP bound to the BioI surface (Fig. 4). ${ }^{76}$ This arrangement resembles insertion of a key into a lock with ACP representing the knob of the key. However in this case the “lock” is a hydrophobic, U-shaped tunnel. The inserted acyl chain is forced to adopt a kinked U-shaped conformation which positions C7–C8 atoms at the bend of the “U” which is immediately above the heme iron. ${ }^{76}$ BioI is thought to hold the acyl chain at the active site for hydroxylation at C7 and then at C8 to form the vicinal diol which is subsequently cleaved to give pimeloyl-ACP. The hydrophobic tunnel extends beyond the heme group to accommodate varying acyl chain lengths (C14–C18). ${ }^{76}$ Hence, the geometry of the active site allows precise cleavage of the C7–C8 bond independent of the acyl chain length, producing pimeloyl-ACP and a monocarboxylic acid from the methyl end. The non-specific cleavage observed with free fatty acid substrates is explained by the lack of ACP to anchor the acyl chain. The lack of anchoring would allow the acyl chain to slide back and forth in the hydrophobic tunnel resulting in the diversity of products observed. ${ }^{76}$ Although this picture is satisfying, it should be noted that BioI has not yet been shown to be catalytic with acyl-ACP substrates. Cleavage of acyl-ACP substrates has only been demonstrated for acyl-ACPs that copurified with BioI and less than stoichiometric production of pimelate was observed. ${ }^{74}$

Several $B$. subtilis BioI–BioW pathway questions remain unanswered. It is unclear whether or not both BioI and BioW
are required for biotin biosynthesis. The straightforward hypothesis is that BioI is essential for producing pimeloyl-ACP while BioW scavenges pimelic acid from the environment or possibly from nonspecific cleavage of free fatty acids by BioI.69 A mutation in the bioI gene causes B. subtilis to grow poorly suggesting that pimelic acid may be produced by other metabolic pathways and become converted to pimeloyl-CoA by BioW.69 Another question is the substrate for AON synthesis in B. subtilis. Since both pimeloyl-CoA and pimeloyl-ACP are produced, does B. subtilis AONS recognize both CoA and ACP substrates? The question of CoA versus ACP substrates in the AONS reaction needs to be addressed. Although CoA is a good in vitro analogue of ACP, ACP may not readily mimic CoA. The active site of AONS would need to accommodate additional protein-protein interactions and overcome the dynamic sequestration of the acylated 4-phosphopantetheine moiety within the four helix structure of the protein.77 Since BioW has not been tested with ACP as the thiol acceptor and BioI catalysis has not been tested with acyl-CoAs, the identity of the physiological pimeloyl carrier(s) remains to be determined.

### Other pathways for the synthesis of pimelate

Genomic analysis of biotin biosynthetic gene suggests the presence of alternative pathways for pimelate synthesis. Most of the pathways seem likely to be variations of the BioC-BioH pathway found in E. coli where the two proteins operate as a functional pair. Although the bioC gene is widely distributed in bacteria, homologues of the bioH gene seem to be missing from many bioC-containing genomes.78 In those genomes bioC is often found within a bio gene cluster immediately downstream of a gene called bioG that may replace BioH function. It is interesting to note that Neisseria meningitidis has both bioC-bioH and bioC-bioG gene pairs whereas Bacteroides fragilis has a gene that seems to encode a BioC-BioG fusion protein that potentially catalyzes both the BioC O-methylation reaction and the BioH demethylation reaction.78 In cyanobacteria another gene bioK is found upstream of bioC and thus there may be a second means to replace BioH function.78 The function of bioH has been shown to be replaced by the Mesorhizobium loti bioZ gene.79 The primary sequence of BioZ bears significant homology to the FabH 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase of fatty acid synthesis which catalyzes the initiation condensation of acetyl-CoA with malonyl-ACP.79 Therefore, BioZ may be a dedicated biotin biosynthetic 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase that catalyzes the condensation of two malonyl moieties required to introduce the ω-carboxyl moiety.79 The most intriguing biotin biosynthetic pathway is encoded in the Desulfovibrio vulgaris and D. desulfuricans genomes.80 These genomes contain a large insertion of five new genes within the standard bioA, bioB, bioD and bioF gene cluster. These genes share sequence homology to ACP, 3-oxoacyl-ACP synthase, 3-oxoacyl-ACP reductase and 3-hydroxyacyl-ACP dehydratase. Since Desulfovibrio lacks the known genes for the synthesis of pimelate (bioC, bioH, bioI and bioW), the new genes could encode a modified fatty acid synthetic pathway committed to pimelate production.

The biotin synthetic genes of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a yeast that has long been used to bioassay biotin and the late intermediates of the pathway, have an unusually convoluted history. Many S. cerevisiae strains isolated from the wild cannot synthesize biotin but still encode functional analogues of the E. coli bioA, bioD and bioB genes called BIO3, BIO4 and BIO2, respectively. However other S. cerevisiae strains grow well without biotin supplementation and a third class of strains grow in the absence of exogenous biotin, although biotin supplementation stimulates growth.81 These diverse phenotypes produced a conflicting literature dating back to Pasteur. Indeed, even S. cerevisiae laboratory strains are variable (e.g., S288c the strain from which the genome sequence was obtained, requires biotin for growth whereas A364a, a strain used in much of the cell cycle research does not). The work of Hall and Dietrich82 argues that a yeast ancestor lost its biotin synthetic pathway and subsequently reacquired the pathway by two processes, one of which was by lateral gene transfer from bacteria. In the second reacquisition process yeast gene duplication was followed by acquisition of a biotin synthetic function by one of the duplicated copies.82 Those S. cerevisiae strains that are defective in biotin biosynthesis lack either BIO6 (an AONS acquired from a duplicated yeast gene) or both BIO6 and a gene of unknown function called BIO1. The differing growth rates seen in strains that do not require biotin are thought due to the variations in the copy numbers of BIO6 and BIO1.82 BIO1 has been proposed to encode a pimeloyl-CoA synthetase.82 Although this proposal seems to fit its place in the pathway, the encoded Biol protein has no sequence similarities to any known pimeloyl-CoA synthetase and lacks a recognizable ATP binding site. Hence, either BIO1 encodes a very unusual acyl-CoA synthetase or the protein has another function. As in B. subtilis the S. cerevisiae pimelate source is also unknown. Genes encoding proteins that resemble the bacterial enzymes involved in pimelate synthesis have yet to be identified in S. cerevisiae.

### Conclusions

The two known pathways of pimelate synthesis share one requirement in common: fatty acid synthesis. The BioC-BioH pathway employs molecular disguise using methylation and demethylation reactions to produce a primer molecule (malonyl-CoA methyl ester) dedicated for biotin biosynthesis. Disguise of the malonyl moiety allows chain elongation and subsequent elimination of the oxo group by fatty acid synthetic enzymes to yield a pimeloyl moiety that serves as a carbon backbone for biotin. Interestingly this biosynthetic scheme is analogous to protective groups in organic synthesis; however in biotin biosynthesis the disguise facilitates synthesis whereas in organic synthesis the protective group prevents undesired reaction. The BioI pathway takes a more straightforward approach to pimelate synthesis by intercepting standard products of fatty acid synthesis to make pimeloyl-ACP. These two pathways offer different viewpoints to our understanding of biosynthesis of complex biomolecules. Perhaps greater metabolic efficiency and diversity are evolutionarily engineered, not by creating new enzymes, but by “borrowing” existing pathways to perform new jobs.
