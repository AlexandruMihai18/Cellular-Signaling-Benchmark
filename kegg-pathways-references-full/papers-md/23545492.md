Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) is the predominant liver disease worldwide and hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome. Its histology spectrum ranges from steatosis, to steatohepatitis (NASH) that can progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The increasing incidence of NAFLD has contributed to rising numbers of HCC occurrences. NAFLD progression is governed by genetic susceptibility, environmental factors, lifestyle and features of the metabolic syndrome, many of which overlap with HCC. Gene expression profiling and genome wide association studies have identified novel disease pathways and polymorphisms in genes that may be potential biomarkers of NAFLD progression. However, the multifactorial nature of NAFLD and limited number of sufficiently powered studies are among the current limitations for validated biomarkers of clinical utility. Further studies incorporating the links between circadian regulation and hepatic metabolism might represent an additional direction in the search for predictive biomarkers of liver disease progression and treatment outcomes.

Keywords: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NASH, hepatocellular carcinoma, genomics, GWAS, candidate gene approaches

1. INTRODUCTION

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a widely prevalent hepatic metabolic disorder affecting up to 35% of western populations (Figure 1), with an even higher risk in individuals with obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [1-3]. NAFLD patients display a broad range of progressive stages including the relatively benign steatosis, inflammation- and oxidative stress-induced non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and ultimately, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The poor understanding of NAFLD pathogenesis stems from its complex nature, governed by close interactions between genetic factors and environmental cues. Recent studies have indicated the role of NAFLD as an emerging menace in triggering HCC [4], which is the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide and the third leading cause of cancer deaths [5]. 70-85% of all diagnosed liver cancers are represented by HCC [6] whose rising incidence has been witnessed in many developed countries [7]. While hepatitis virus B and C (HBV/HCV) infections remain major risk factors worldwide for HCC, a growing body of evidence clearly associates obesity, T2D, alcohol and tobacco abuse with HCC risk, at least in the United States [7, 8]. A recent German study identified steatohepatitis as the underlying aetiology of HCC in 24% of patients compared to 23.3% with chronic HCV infection [9]. In addition to the development of HCC from advanced forms of NAFLD, steatosis has also been implicated in the development of HCC from cryptogenic cirrhosis [6] as well as non-cirrhotic livers [10]. Thus, the proportion of NAFLD patients at risk of developing HCC may be much higher than estimated to date, highlighting the importance of the elucidation of molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and malignant transformation to HCC.

### 1.1 NAFLD PATHOGENESIS

The accumulation of triglycerides in the liver (>5% of steatotic cells in a liver section) is a histological hallmark of hepatic steatosis [11, 12]. Patients diagnosed with NAFLD in the absence of other hepatic disease aetiologies or excessive alcohol consumption also display lobular inflammation, mild portal inflammation [13] and elevated levels of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) in addition to hepatic steatosis [14]. Isotopic studies in liver biopsies from obese, hypertriglyceridemic and hyperinsulinemic NAFLD patients have revealed elevated levels of adipose-derived free fatty acid flux and de novo lipogenesis [15], along with compromised fatty acid oxidation and secretion [16].
The modulated expression and/or secretion of transcription factors and cytokines respectively, influences downstream metabolic pathways and thus, play a crucial role in NAFLD pathogenesis (Figure 2). For example, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) controls the expression of lipogenic genes. Elevated SREBP-1c correlates with hepatic steatosis in NAFLD patients [17]. The absence of carbohydrate-response element binding protein (ChREBP) that regulates glucose metabolism and lipogenesis improves hepatic steatosis, indicating that ChREBP is also linked to NAFLD [18]. Similarly, various PPAR subtypes are linked to the pathogenesis of NAFLD [19]. Apart from transcription factors involved in endogenous lipid metabolism, nuclear receptors regulating xenobiotic metabolism such as pregnane X receptor (PXR) and constitutive androstane receptor (CAR) and phase I and II drug metabolizing enzymes also have altered profiles in NAFLD patients. The cross-talk between hepatic lipid and drug metabolism and its impact on the development of NAFLD has been reviewed in detail recently [20].

While the progression of benign steatosis is relatively low, about 2–5% of the general population progresses to NASH [3] (Figure 1). Obesity (BMI > 30 kg/m²) increases the risk of NAFLD progression with a prevalence of >25% of NASH patients among obese populations [2]. NASH is characterised by a steatotic histology, severe lobular inflammation and hepatocellular injury, such as the presence of ballooning, apoptosis or necrosis [13]. The progression from NAFLD to NASH results from at least 2 hits (Figure 2): the accumulation of triglycerides in the liver and the activation of inflammatory, oxidative stress and fibrogenesis pathways [21, 22], along with free fatty acid lipotoxicity [23, 24]. Apart from lipotoxicity due to the accumulation of fatty acids, ceramide and cholesterol are also crucial mediators of hepatic lipotoxicity [25]. The transcription factor SREBP 2 that regulates cholesterol synthesis is elevated in hyperinsulinemia, which results in cholesterol accumulation, higher levels of low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) and reduced efflux of free cholesterol into the bile, thus cumulatively contributing to the progression of NAFLD to NASH [26, 27]. NASH patients have elevated expression of genes involved in stellate cell activation and fibrogenesis and downregulated expression of survival genes [28]. Oxidative stress due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulting from mitochondrial dysfunction, peroxisomal and microsomal fatty acid oxidation and lipid peroxidation is a hallmark of NASH. Liver injury resulting from chronic exposure to drugs hampers the
mitochondrial role in fatty acid oxidation, promotes steatosis and activates the cascade of ROS generation and subsequent endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress [20, 25, 29].

Among the cytokines, the adipose tissue secreted adipokines (adiponectin and leptin) are linked to progression from NAFLD to NASH. Adiponectin correlates negatively with insulin resistance, plasma triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, hepatic fat content and progression to NASH in NAFLD patients [30-32]. A deficiency of leptin causes hyperphagia, obesity and fatty liver, as shown in the ob/ob leptin-deficient mouse model. Leptin activates AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) in skeletal muscle and the liver resulting in enhancement of fatty acid oxidation and hepatic glucose production and suppression of lipogenesis, thus improving NAFLD [33, 34]. Levels of soluble leptin receptor which binds the circulating leptin correlates with diabetes, fibrosis and NAFLD progression in morbidly obese patients [35].

Other adipokines, such as resistin, visfatin and retinol binding protein 4 (RBP4) also appear as promising potential NAFLD mechanistic markers [36-39]. The cytokine tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) is elevated in NASH patients compared to patients with benign steatosis [40]. It activates the transcription of other pro-inflammatory cytokines such as inhibitor of nuclear factor kappa-β (IKKβ) and nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-κB) [41] and enzymes involved in de novo lipogenesis [42].

The inability of hepatocytes to regenerate and replace dead cells is the proposed third hit in NAFLD progression, leading to an increased population of hepatocyte progenitor cells and prolonged infiltration of inflammatory mediators [43]. These events are catalytic to hepatic fibrosis, cirrhosis and eventually hepatocellular carcinoma (Figure 2). The presence of the metabolic syndrome and histological features of NASH in cryptogenic cirrhosis patients imply the progression from NASH to cirrhosis [44]. In addition, the development of HCC from NASH coincided with the presence of cirrhosis in a Japanese population [45]. However, studies in mice with obesity-related steatosis show hyperplasia and reduced cell death even in the absence of cirrhosis [46]. Molecular factors involved in obesity and diabetes establish a tumour-promoting environment, which distinguishes the pathogenesis of NAFLD-related HCC to that of viral or other aetiologies [47]. In obesity, the adipose tissue expansion leads to increased release of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFα and interleukin-6 (IL-6) that activate pro-oncogenic and anti-apoptotic pathways [39, 47]. Ectopic deposition of fat in hepatocytes may alter gene expression profiles through deregulation
of cell signalling pathways and contribute to development of HCC [48]. Elevated levels of peroxides and free radicals

as a consequence of fatty acid oxidation can cause oxidative injury, endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis[49].

These events together promote liver inflammation and increase the risk of developing HCC.

2. OMIC APPROACHES AID IN UNDERSTANDING LIVER PATHOLOGIES

A large number of high resolution omic studies in NAFLD patients and animal models have contributed to novel insights into the molecular aspects of NAFLD [28, 50, 51]. Reverse-phase protein microarrays indicated a deregulation of the insulin-receptor mediated molecular signalling in white adipose tissue of progressive NAFLD patients [52]. Specific phosphorylation and biomarker (e.g. caspase 9) signatures in omental fat could differentiate between steatotic and NASH obese patients. Serum metabolomics has identified a panel of biomarkers that can differentiate the NAFLD/NASH disease state from normal [53]. These findings are crucial in the search for predictive non-invasive biomarkers as at present the liver biopsy is the most accurate method to diagnose early progression stages from steatosis to NASH. Recent advances in sequencing and expression profiling technologies, fine mapping and functional analysis of genomes, genome-wide association studies and applications of animal models, along with initiatives such as the Human Genome Project, HapMap and ENCODE, provided novel insights to dissect the pathogenesis of NAFLD, as described further.

Male C57/BL6 mice that develop hepatic steatosis and obesity on a high-fat diet displayed altered expression of 309 genes compared to the control diet, including genes of the lipogenesis and fatty acid oxidation pathways [50]. Rodents with orotic acid-induced steatosis displayed altered expression of genes involved in fatty acid, lipoprotein and glucose metabolism and stress and inflammatory pathways [54].

Transcriptomic analyses in patients with different stages of NAFLD identified differential expression of hepatic and adipose genes at progressive stages of NAFLD [28, 55]. While early stages of NAFLD were accompanied by upregulation of cell survival and liver regeneration genes and downregulation of defence mechanisms against oxidative stress [28], NASH stages displayed upregulation of stellate cell activation, inflammation, fibrogenesis and detoxification pathways centred around TNFα, IL-6, JUN and interferon γ (IFN-γ) regulation. Additionally, the
survival factor ADP-ribosylation factor-like 6 interacting protein (ARL6IP/RAMER) and phase II enzyme

sulfotransferase 1A2 (SULT1A2) were downregulated [28, 55]. Gene expression analysis comparing Caucasians, who have a higher risk of NAFLD, and African-Americans indicated ethnic differences in gene expression patterns, especially among NASH patients [56]. The most prominently upregulated genes in African-Americans are glutathione s-transferases GSTM-2, -4, -5, acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 4 (ACSL4), insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and cytochrome p4503A4 (CYP3A4) [56].

Additionally, epigenetic changes and microRNAs have been linked to liver pathologies. A study comparing miRNA expression in NASH patients against controls identified a significant decrease in miR-122, which may account for insulin resistance, oxidative stress, apoptosis and inflammation in NASH [57]. miR-122 accounts for 70% of hepatic miRNA and its inhibition in mice on a high-fat diet improved hepatic steatosis, lowered plasma cholesterol and the expression of lipogenic genes [58]. Other miRNAs such as miR-335, miR-181d and miR-10b have been implicated in lipid homeostasis and adipocyte differentiation [59].

### 2.1 GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH NAFLD AND HCC

The heritability of NAFLD and its complex nature has triggered the advent of several candidate gene studies and a few genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in NAFLD populations. Similarly, numerous candidate-gene studies have reported associations between SNPs and the presence of HCC, while limited GWAS studies have shed light into additional unsuspected loci that might be involved in hepatic carcinogenesis [60]. The variants identified in association with HCC and NAFLD share some common molecular pathways such as oxidative stress, iron metabolism, inflammatory and immune response, suggesting that gene variants associated with NAFLD could potentially modulate pathways involved in HCC and vice versa [60]. A comparison of SNPs curated from NAFLD-related literature searches and those reviewed by Nahon et al. [60] in the context of HCC, highlighted only 4 common SNPs: GSTM1 and SOD2 A16V from the oxidative stress response pathway, TNF G-238A involved in inflammatory/immune response and PNPLAII48M, which potentially has a lipolytic role. However, it is important to note that the HCC variants described by Nahon et al. were discovered in studies that compared normal controls to
HBV-or HCV-infected patients or patients with alcohol abuse. Studies designed to identify genetic risks of NAFLD-triggered HCC are limited and require a more focussed attention in the future [4, 61].

The most prominent genetic variations associated with NAFLD are listed in Table 1. Below we provide a detailed overview of polymorphisms that have been associated with NAFLD. We begin by describing the four overlapping polymorphisms associated with NAFLD and HCC in genes PNPLA3, SOD2, TNFA, GSTM1, followed by other contributing SNPs in genes involved in lipid metabolism, inflammatory pathways, xenobiotic detoxification, etc.

### 2.1.1 Patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3)

PNPLA3 is one of the few examples that has been validated in several populations and conclusively shown to associate with NAFLD. Although the functional roles of PNPLA3, which encodes adiponutrin, or its genetic variants have not been fully determined, it is known to have lipase activity in vitro. The expression of PNPLA3 is regulated by ChREBP and SREBP, implicating its function in glucose and lipid metabolism [62]. Surprisingly, Pnpla3 knock-out (KO) mice or mice with increased Pnpla3 expression did not display lipolysis abnormalities or hepatic steatosis [63]. The activation of compensatory mechanisms that may involve other members of the Pnpla family was not observed either. Hence, developing tissue-specific Pnpla3-overexpression models may be a more accurate approach to solve these inconsistencies.

PNPLA3 was first identified as a susceptibility gene in a large study including Hispanics, African-Americans and European-Americans from the Dallas Heart Study [64]. The rs738409[G] variant significantly associates with increased hepatic fat and inflammation whereas the rs6006460[T] correlates with lower hepatic fat. This observation was replicated in a Finnish study [65] and a recent large-scale GWAS study genotyping 2.4 million SNPs in 7100 individuals as a meta-analysis from several large population studies [66]. Moreover, studies in Italian, Chinese, Indian, Malay, Japanese and United Kingdom populations indicated that a homozygosity in the rs738409[G] variant predisposed patients to NASH [67-69]. A study to determine if the NAFLD-associated rs738409 variant in PNPLA3 also affects the prognosis of HCC in Japanese patients concluded a higher incidence of the G/G genotype of rs738409 PNPLA3 in NAFLD-related HCC [70]. The genotype associated with higher BMI and severe fibrosis but was found

8to affect HCC prognosis only in the alcoholic liver disease patients' subgroup [70]. The G allele of rs738409PNPLA3

was also over-represented in alcoholic/metabolic cirrhosis Italian patients with HCC [71], in accordance with

Takeuchi et al., highlighting the potential predictive value of this polymorphism for HCC occurrence in cirrhotic

patients.

### 2.1.2 Manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD/SOD2)

As oxidative stress represents the second-hit in the development of NASH, molecular mechanisms that lead to the

generation of ROS may contribute to NASH pathogenesis. SOD2 protects against ROS by detoxifying superoxides

into oxygen and hydrogen peroxide. The 1183T/C polymorphism has been identified in the targeting sequence that

directs SOD2 to the mitochondria. The presence of TT genotype at this position associates with NASH and with the

degree of fibrosis in NAFLD patients, due to decreased transport of the protein into the mitochondria [72, 73]. This

association was further confirmed by familial analysis using the transmission disequilibrium test in 55 informative

families and a case-control study in a larger European NAFLD population [74], both with biopsy-proven NASH.

[60]. A prospective study in alcoholic cirrhosis patients identified the presence of the Ala16Val-SOD2 allele as a

susceptibility factor for HCC development and death, with further detrimental outcomes in combination with the G-

463A myeloperoxidase (MPO) variant [75]. This may be attributed to excessive hepatic iron accumulation associated

with Ala16Val-SOD2, accompanied by increased ROS-related oxidative stress and DNA damage caused by excessive

MPO activity [75].

### 2.1.3 Tumour necrosis factor α (TNFα)

TNFα is a cytokine with broad functionality in inflammation, autoimmunity, tumour apoptosis and metabolic

regulation [76]. Increased levels of TNFα correlate with insulin resistance and the activation of inflammatory

pathways, thus increasing the risk of NAFLD progression to NASH [39, 77]. Several polymorphisms have been

identified in the TNFα gene promoter [78]. Candidate gene studies in an Italian population identified a higher

prevalence of the TNFα-238 promoter polymorphism but not the -308 polymorphism in NAFLD patients compared

to controls [79]. Despite impaired insulin sensitivity, the -238 polymorphism also associated with lower LDL-
cholesterol, and comparatively lower BMI, indicating an inverse effect on the regulation of glucose and lipid metabolism. Similar observations were made in a Mexican and two separate Chinese cohorts that displayed an association between TNFα-238 and NAFLD/NASH [80-82]. A study in Japanese population identified two different polymorphisms in the TNFα promoter, -1031C and -863A, that were present at a higher frequency in NASH patients compared to patients with simple steatosis [83]. The lack of association of the -238 and -308 polymorphisms in the Japanese could be attributed to ethnic differences and the low frequency of variations at these positions in this population. Although other studies in Chinese populations failed to identify any of these associations, mainly due to the lack of statistical power [84], a meta-analysis of 8 studies evaluating polymorphisms in TNFα confirmed the association of the -238 polymorphism with NAFLD, however the -308 polymorphism was not identified as a susceptibility factor [85].

Another recent meta-analysis to assess the association between TNFα polymorphisms and HCC susceptibility showed that TNFA-308G/A, TNFA-238G/A and TNFA-863C/A polymorphisms may associate with HCC in Asians populations [86]. This observation is biologically plausible in the context of tumour-promoting roles of TNFα in various cancer types [87].

### 2.1.4 Glutathione S-transferases (GST)

Glutathione S-transferases (GST) are phase II DMEs involved in xenobiotic detoxification and protection against oxidative stress. A case-control analysis indicated that the GSTM1-null genotype was present at a higher frequency in a Japanese NAFLD population [88]. A meta-analysis suggests that the null genotype of GSTM1 associates with increased HCC risk in Asians. Individuals with the dual GSTM1/GSTT1-null genotype have an even further susceptibility in developing HCC [89]. The GSTM1/GSTT1-null genotype has also been identified in association with several complex disorders featuring oxidative stress, inflammatory and detoxification irregularities, such as T2D [90], male infertility [91], etc. Thus, it seems plausible that GST-null polymorphisms associate with characteristics such as oxidative stress and inflammation, rather than with the disease in general.

2.1.5 Peroxisome-proliferator-activated Receptor α (PPARα) signalling

PPARα plays a major regulatory role in lipid metabolism by activating fatty acid oxidation and lipid hydrolysis, thus preventing hepatic lipid accumulation [19, 92]. Adiponectin has an indirect effect on PPARα activation [93]. Mice fed a methionine-, choline-deficient diet (MCD) develop steatosis, which is improved on treatment with PPARα-agonists [94]. Similarly, PPARα-/– mice develop hepatic steatosis on a high-fat diet [95]. Thus, PPARα-agonists fibrates are used to treat patients with elevated plasma triglycerides [96]. Several studies show a correlation between the Val227Ala variant of PPARα and low serum lipids [97, 98]. A case-control comparison study of NAFLD patients highlighted a potential protective role for the Val227Ala variant against obesity. The subjects with the Ala227 variant appear to have lower fat-related indices, although no significant differences were identified in serum glucose, triglyceride, and cholesterol levels [99]. The functional role of this SNP requires further elucidation.

PPARγ-coactivator 1-alpha (PGC1-α/PPARGC1A) is a systemic modulator of energy homeostasis, a deficiency of which results in enhanced lipogenesis and hepatic steatosis in mice [100]. The regulation of PGC1-α by sirtulin (SIRT1) and AMPK may possibly provide a mechanism for its ability to sense metabolic deregulations [101]. Post-translational modifications such as DNA methylation in the PGC1-α gene associate with a degree of insulin resistance in NAFLD patients and to the liver mitochondrial DNA content [102]. The T allele of the SNP rs2290602 in PPARGC1A was present at a significantly higher frequency in NASH patients compared to patients with simple steatosis and associated with decreased expression of the gene in a Japanese biopsy-proven NAFLD population [103].

2.1.6 Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP)

MTTP is involved in the formation of VLDL particles from triglycerides and apolipoprotein B (ApoB). A study in rats has indicated a role of DNA methylation of the Mttp promoter which decreased the expression of Mttp gene on high-fat diet [104]. The -493G/T MTTP polymorphism occurred at a higher incidence in a Japanese NASH population compared to healthy controls [72]. The G allele results in decreased transcription of the MTTP gene and in increased accumulation of triglycerides in the liver. Furthermore, the degree of disease severity and plasma lipid profile correlated with the G/G genotype at -493 position of the MTTP gene in a cohort of NASH patients,
independently of the level of adipokines and insulin resistance [105]. However, due to the small number of patients in

this study these observations need to be replicated in larger cohorts and different populations.

### 2.1.7 Phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase (PEMT)

PEMT contributes to the synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from phosphatidylethanolamine. Phosphatidylcholine is an essential component of VLDL formation for hepatic triglyceride secretion. Loss of function of Pemt results in increased accumulation of lipids in mice [106]. The V175M loss-of-function mutation in the human PEMT gene associates with NAFLD patients [107]. This observation has been replicated in a Chinese population [81]. Moreover, the presence of the polymorphism may indicate susceptibility to NASH, as observed in a Japanese population of NASH patients compared to healthy controls [108].

### 2.1.8 Apolipoprotein C-III (ApoCIII)

ApoC-III, which is expressed in the liver, functions as an inhibitor of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) that hydrolyses triglycerides in VLDL particles and chylomicrons in the plasma. Its absence or over-expression results in hyper- or hypo-triglyceridemia, respectively. In mice, insulin inhibits ApoCIII expression via the nuclear exclusion of FOXO1, a transcription factor triggering the expression of ApoCIII, which explains the aberrant apoCIII production in the presence of insulin resistance [109]. 38% of APOCIIIC482T and T455C variant carriers display an increase in fasting plasma apoCIII and triglycerides in the presence of NAFLD, compared to none in the wild-type allele carriers, as observed in a study on Asian Indian men that was further confirmed in men of non-Asian Indian descent [110]. However, no associations between hepatic triglyceride content and insulin resistance and the two APOCIII variants were identified in a much larger study on multiple ethnic populations from the Dallas Heart study and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities study (ARIC) [111] and separate studies in an obese Italian [112] and Finnish cohort [113].

### 2.1.9 Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)

ApoE is a major component of lipoprotein particles and its role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD is widely accepted. Rodent studies indicate lowered susceptibility for the development of obesity and NAFLD in the absence of ApoE[114, 115]. APOE gene has variants ε2, ε3 and ε4. The occurrence of the APOE ε3 allele is significantly higher in biopsy-proven Caucasian NASH patients compared to controls [116], whereas the presence of the APOE ε2 allele may be protective against NAFLD [117]. However, these associations need to be confirmed in larger populations of different ethnicities.

### 2.1.10 Adiponectin signalling

Adiponectin has numerous systemic protective roles, such as insulin-sensitization, anti-inflammatory, anti-fibrogenic and anti-atherogenic effects, ceramide catabolism and suppression of hepatic gluconeogenesis [39, 118]. SNPs G45T and G276T of the adiponectin gene occur at a higher incidence in an Italian NAFLD cohort compared to controls, together with a reduced postprandial adiponectin response and increased postprandial plasma triglycerides, free fatty acids and VLDL [119]. The study in Asian population did not confirm the above results [120]. Adiponectin in the liver binds to adipoR2 receptor, which correlates negatively with insulin resistance [121]. ADIPOR2 rs767870 polymorphism significantly associates with hepatic lipid accumulation, as observed in a Finnish cohort and confirmed in two independent studies [122]. The presence of the C allele in the ADIPOR2 gene correlates to a 50% decrease in hepatic fat accumulation and a significant decrease in serum γ-glutamyl transferase and triglyceride concentrations after accounting for body mass index (BMI) [122].

### 2.1.11 Insulin receptor signalling

Insulin resistance is a commonly observed characteristic in NAFLD and NASH patients. Inflammatory factors target insulin receptor substrate (IRS) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation via activation of suppressors of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS-3), thus causing a downregulation in insulin sensitivity [123]. NAFLD and T2D patients are usually treated with PPARγ-targeted thiazolidinediones, an insulin-sensitizer that reduces lipid release, induces lipid uptake and storage and suppresses hepatic gluconeogenesis [124]. Polymorphisms in the plasma cell antigen-1 (PC-1)/ectoenzyme nucleotide pyrophosphate phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) (Lys121Gln) and in IRS-1 (Gly172Arg), both affecting insulin receptor activity, are significantly associated with NAFLD disease severity in biopsy-proven Caucasian NAFLD patients [125].
2.1.12 Growth Hormone (GH) and Insulin-like growth factor (IGF) axis

NAFLD and other characteristics of the metabolic are common in patients with adult growth hormone deficiency (AGHD) syndrome and hypopituitarism. GH positively regulates fatty acid oxidation, lipolysis, LDL clearance and gluconeogenesis [126]. A majority of these effects are propagated via the interaction of GH with IGF-1, which is a catabolic hormone secreted by hepatocytes on GH-stimulation. The bioavailability of IGF-1 is regulated by IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) [127]. Studies in rodents have also identified GH-independent IGF-1 effects in improving NASH by downregulating oxidative stress [128]. Both obese and AGHD patients with NAFLD and insulin resistance display low levels of GH and IGF-1 and an increase in GH-binding protein (GHBP) and IGFBP-3 that correlate with the stage of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis [129, 130]. The frequency and severity of fatty liver negatively correlates with GH levels in hypopituitary males with features of the metabolic syndrome [131].

Furthermore, GH-replacement therapy ameliorates oxidative stress in NASH patients with AGHD [132]. Several SNPs associated with serum lipid profiles were identified in patients with severe AGHD and hypopituitarism in a candidate gene association study [133]. The G allele of PPARy associated with low LDL-cholesterol. Minor alleles of rs1800775, rs708272 and rs3764261 in the CETP gene correlated with increased serum HDL-cholesterol, the T allele of APOE SNP rs7412 associated with low total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol and the C allele of SNP rs35136575 in the APOE/C1/C4/C2 gene cluster associated with increased serum triglyceride levels in these patients. Although association of these SNPs with hepatic fat content was not studied, they might represent potential candidates in context of NAFLD development. Moreover, IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 polymorphisms could potentially be associated with NAFLD-related changes in IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 proteins [134, 135].

2.1.13 Interleukin 6 (IL-6)

Inflammation as the second hit in NASH development is well defined. Elevated IL-6 associates with inflammation and insulin resistance via proteosomal degradation of IRS-1 [123, 136, 137]. Circulating levels of IL-6 are increased
in individuals with T2D and obesity [137, 138]. In a Caucasian cohort the IL-6-174C variant occurred at a higher frequency in NASH than in NAFLD patients and was accompanied by an increased insulin resistance, in accordance with several studies that suggested the association of the C allele with T2D, insulin resistance and other markers of the metabolic syndrome [139].

### 2.1.14 Drug metabolising enzymes (DMEs)

Differential expression of DMEs in NAFLD patients is mainly due to the presence of common factors that govern lipid and xenobiotic metabolism [140]. In healthy conditions the nuclear receptors and phase II DMEs provide defence against hepatic oxidative stress. PXR is a nuclear receptor that regulates the expression of several DMEs and is also activated by endobiotics. Its activation in mice results in hepatic steatosis [141]. rs2461823[A] and rs7643645[G]-containing haplotypes in the PXR gene associated with disease severity and liver injury in a European NAFLD population [142].

The role of GSTM, a phase II DME, and SNPs in the encoding gene associated with NAFLD and HCC are described in section 2.1.4. Apart from that the phase II DME UDP-glucuronosyltransferases 1A1 (UGT1A1) that protect cells against reactive oxygen species are also candidates for genetic association studies in an obese Taiwanese pediatric cohort, where the UGT1A1*6 allele associated with a lower risk of NAFLD [143]. SNPs rs17222723 and rs8187710 in the ABC-transporter ABCC2 associated with NAFLD, liver histology and disease severity [144].

### 2.1.15 Other variant genes linked to NAFLD

Novel genetic variants were identified in association with computer tomography (CT)-measured hepatic steatosis [66]. These include neurocan (NCAN, rs2228603), the gene encoding a protein regulating cell adhesion and migration, glucokinase regulator (GCKR, rs780094), which inhibits glycogen synthesis, and lysophospholipase-like 1 (LYPLAL1, rs12137855) that is involved in triglyceride synthesis. These variants display association patterns with histologic NAFLD, serum lipids and glycaemic and anthropometric traits. A GWAS in adolescents diagnosed with NAFLD identified SNP associations to two liver-specific genes (the group-specific component (GC, rs222054) and lymphocyte cytosolic protein 1 (LCP1, rs7324845)), two neuron-specific genes (lipid phosphatase-related proteintype 4 (LPPR4, rs12743824) and a solute carrier family 38 member 8 (SLC38A8, rs11864146). This study further confirmed the significant differential expression of GC and LCP1 in a NAFLD cohort [145]. Further functional characterisation of proteins encoded by these genes is required to dissect their molecular role in NAFLD pathogenesis.

3. CONCLUSION AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The multi-faceted, complex, non-Mendelian nature of NAFLD and HCC shows the heterogeneous nature of the disease in terms of disease progression, severity, susceptibility in different ethnic populations and treatment responses. Although GWAS and candidate gene approaches identified several susceptibility factors associated with NAFLD, only a few (in the case of NAFLD only PNPLA3) have been confirmed in multiple populations. Most studies suffer from lack of statistical power, replication in different populations, well-matched samples and the presence of heterogeneities in disease stages. Non-additive effects, such as dominance, epistasis, environmental and lifestyle factors, hinder identification of genes associated with NAFLD pathogenesis. As the invasive liver biopsy technique remains the gold standard to diagnose NASH, a majority of the current studies base on ultrasound identification of the disease stage which lacks accuracy due to its inability to separate steatosis from early stages of NASH. Large-scale inter-protocol agreements and standardization of grading criteria for different stages of liver diseases are needed to reduce the current technical variability [146]. Further development of combined polymorphism risk-scoring algorithms, in combination with whole genome sequencing, could enable identification of high-risk groups for preventative care and early detection of the disease.

A future perspective: Disrupted circadian clock is another factor of liver diseases

A wide array of physiological processes exhibit a circadian (~24h) rhythm represented by transcriptional and translational feedback loops that govern internal clocks. In the liver, the circadian rhythm results from an interplay of cis-regulatory elements [147]. Consequently, it is believed that the intrinsic gene regulatory networks determine the hepatic clock, whereas systemic cues, such as light-dark cycles, serve only to fine-tune the rhythm. Several circadian transcription factors that can switch the gene expression on and off have been identified but knowledge regarding global changes of rhythmic transcription at the genome level is only starting to be revealed [148]. Circadian processesat the body level include the sleep/wake cycle, body temperature, blood pressure, hormone secretion, etc. In the liver,
the crucial endogenous metabolic pathways (metabolism of glucose, fatty acids, cholesterol, amino acids, etc.) and
detoxification of xenobiotics represent thousands of genes that are orchestrated by the molecular circadian clock [148-
150]. The concentration of several blood metabolites, including cholesterol [151] and corticosterone [152], the mouse
analogue of cortisol, changes over 24-hour periods. It is thus not surprising than an intact circadian clock is essential
for the maintenance of body homeostasis [150] and that disruption of the clock leads to desynchronization of
metabolism and consequently to pathologies, including obesity and cancer [153]. Furthermore, clock genes have
been identified as potential therapeutic targets. A small molecule KL001 binds to CRY1 and prevents its degradation,
resulting in lengthening of the circadian period. Stabilization of CRY has important metabolic consequences since it
inhibits hepatic gluconeogenesis [154].
The major causes of clock disruption are chronic lifestyle disturbances, such as professional jet lag or long-term shift
work. Here, humans and mice seem to share similar mechanisms since circadian desynchrony also promotes
metabolic disruption in a mouse model of shift work [155], where Per1 and Per2 regulate the physiological response
of metabolism associated genes to sleep disruption [156]. As relations between the hepatic clock and metabolic
disturbances may be difficult to assess in humans, mouse models remain important tools [157-161]. Animals with
mutations in clock genes have provided key insights into the inter-dependence between the circadian clock and
metabolism [162]. One of the most striking proofs of the essential connection between clock and metabolism in
humans arises from a 14-year prospective study in Japan in which about 7000 steel industry workers were routinely
examined for general health and blood lipid parameters. The study established the adverse effects of alternating shift
work on lipid metabolism, leading to a statistically significant rise in total blood cholesterol [163]. The consequences
of the clock disruption for gut systems diseases, including the effect on the liver, have also been reviewed [164] but a
direct link between clock disruption and liver diseases has been shown only in mouse models. Hepatic fibrosis in
mice lead to alterations in the circadian rhythm of hepatic clock genes where the daily rhythm of Cry2 was markedly
decreased and associated with loss of circadian rhythm of Ppara and cytochrome P450 reductase Por [165].
Moreover, the circadian disruption accelerated hepatic carcinogenesis in mice, suggesting that persistent circadian
coordination can slow down and/or revert cancer development [166].In addition to circadian disruption, mutations in the core clock genes might also result in disease susceptibility, progression or influence treatment outcomes. Hawkins et al [167] discovered considerable differences in minor allele frequency across ethnic groups for nonsynonymous coding variants in clock genes PER1, PER2, PER3, CLOCK and TIMELESS. Due to limitations of this study (only 95 subjects of various ethnic groups) the link to disease could not be dissected. In another study, a functional polymorphism in PER3, a circadian repressor, associated with prognosis of HCC patients treated with transcatheter arterial chemoembolization. Patients carrying at least one variant allele of rs2640908 had a significantly lower risk of death when compared with homozygous wild-type allele patients [168]. Another study reported the link between common genetic variations of the CLOCK gene and susceptibility to NAFLD [169]. The study included 136 patients with NAFLD and 64 healthy individuals and showed that CLOCK variant haplotype frequencies significantly differ between NAFLD patients and controls.

Novel indications point to histone modification enzymes as additional gene targets associated with circadian rhythm-related disorders. Circadian modification of histone regions in daily-activated genes highlights epigenetic modification as a key node regulated by the clock. The histone-remodelling enzyme MLL3 was found to modulate hundreds of epigenetically targeted liver circadian “output” genes, especially these in the one-carbon metabolism pathway [148]. MLL3 is thus a good candidate linking the circadian clock and liver diseases. It is plausible to believe that other circadian rhythm-related genes and metabolites might in the future become recognized as promising non-invasive markers that would be useful in determining the stages and prognosis of liver diseases.

Figure 1: Relationship between NAFLD and HCC. NAFLD development is closely linked to diabetes and obesity

and is highly prevalent in patients with these metabolic dysfunctions. NAFLD can be primarily manifested as

steatosis, steatohepatitis or cirrhosis due to obesity-related metabolic complications or can progress through these

stages over several decades. Recent evidence indicates that HCC can develop from any stage of NAFLD, however,

with different likelihoods. While HBV and HCV infections remain the major risk factors for HCC development,

NAFLD-related HCC will become an ever more important risk factor in the near future due to the increasing

prevalence of NAFLD. Hh-hedgehog signalling pathway.
