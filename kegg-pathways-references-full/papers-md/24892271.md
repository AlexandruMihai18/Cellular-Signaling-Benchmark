**ABSTRACT**

Inflammation occurs as a result of exposure of tissues and organs to harmful stimuli such as microbial pathogens, irritants, or toxic cellular components. The primary physical manifestations of inflammation are redness, swelling, heat, pain, and loss of function to the affected area. These processes involve the major cells of the immune system, including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, basophils, dendritic cells, mast cells, T-cells, and B-cells. However, examination of a range of inflammatory lesions demonstrates the presence of specific leukocytes in any given lesion. That is, the inflammatory process is regulated in such a way as to ensure that the appropriate leukocytes are recruited. These events are in turn controlled by a host of extracellular molecular regulators, including members of the cytokine and chemokine families that mediate both immune cell recruitment and complex intracellular signalling control mechanisms that characterise inflammation. This review will focus on the role of the main cytokines, chemokines, and their receptors in the pathophysiology of auto-inflammatory disorders, pro-inflammatory disorders, and neurological disorders involving inflammation.

**1. Introduction**

The last 50 years has witnessed a rapid growth in research into inflammatory diseases. This advance of information has led researchers and physicians to begin to redefine many diseases including heart disease, Alzheimer's disease, type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes and obesity as inflammatory disorders. Much of this new view has come from research showing that people with chronic inflammatory diseases have elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein and other markers of inflammation [1,2]. Relatively minor inflammatory disorders, such as injuries or allergies, can also set the stage for more serious chronic inflammatory diseases, and many inflammatory disorders actually develop as clusters.

Inflammation is controlled by a host of extracellular mediators and regulators, including cytokines, growth factors, eicosanoids (prostaglandins, etc), complement and peptides. In fact, it is the discovery of many of these mediators over the past 20 years that has increased our understanding of the regulation of the inflammatory process whilst, at the same time, revealing its complexity. These extracellular events are matched by equally complex intracellular signalling mechanisms, governed by the ability of cells to assemble and disassemble a complex array of signalling pathways as they move from inactive to dedicated roles within the inflammatory response site. This review will focus on the role of the main cytokine and chemokine cell signalling molecules, and how disruption of these pathways triggers inflammatory disorders.

**2. Cytokine signalling**

Cytokines are key modulators of inflammation, participating in acute and chronic inflammation via a complex and sometimes seemingly contradictory network of interactions. Better understanding of how these pathways are regulated helps facilitate more accurate identification of agents mediating inflammation and the treatment of inflammatory diseases. It is possible to classify cytokines based on the nature of the immune response (Table 1), with individual cytokines also performing specific roles dependent upon cell type and location (Table 2). Key pro-inflammatory cytokines include interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and tumour necrosis factor (TNFα), all of which signal via the type I cytokine receptors that are structurally divergent from other cytokine receptor types. By contrast, the critical pro-inflammatory chemokine, IL-8, signals via G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) (Fig. 1). The major pro-inflammatory cytokines, their receptor-mediated signalling pathways, and their contribution to human disease are discussed below.

**2.1. Interleukin-1 (IL-1)**

The IL-1 family now includes 11 members: IL-1α, IL-1β, the IL-1 receptor antagonist [IL-1Ra], IL-18, IL-33, IL-36α, IL-36β, IL-36γ, IL-36Ra,

IL-37 and IL-1Hy2 [3]. These cytokines are expressed by numerous cell types, including macrophages and monocytes, and comprise both pro- and anti-inflammatory members [3]. Of these, IL-1β is a potent pro-inflammatory cytokine that was originally identified as an endogenous pyrogen. Further, IL-1β and has been found to have a stimulatory effect on CD4+ T cells and to promote differentiation into the Thelper cell lineages, particularly T helper (Th17) cells and a non-classically derived Th1 cell lineage [4]. Given its central role in mediating a wide array of inflammatory signalling responses, we will mainly discuss the actions of the pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-1β, in this section.

IL-1α and IL-1β are synthesised by multiple cell types including monocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, hepatocytes, and tissue macrophages throughout the body [5]. Whereas the expression of IL-1α is constitutive in many cell types, by contrast IL-1β expression is induced mainly in response to microbial molecules, although it can also stimulate its own expression [6]. Stimulation of pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) including Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and NOD-like receptors (NLRs) can be induced both by viral and microbial molecules. This can then lead to the induction of IL-1β expression [7,8]. Members of the IL-1 family, including IL-1β, are typically synthesised as precursors without a secretory sequence. IL-1β must therefore be cleaved in order to generate active cytokine [9] and this is performed by the IL-1-converting enzyme (ICE), or caspase-1, which is contained within a specialised intracellular complex termed the inflammasome [6].

Fig. 1. Cytokines, chemokines and their receptors. Cytokines signal *via* oligomers of single-pass, type I transmembrane receptors, with distinct extracellular domains for ligand binding and intracellular domains that allow signal transduction. The receptor for IL-1 is a complex of IL-1R1 and the IL-1RAcP formed following ligand binding to the extracellular immunoglobulin domains (IGDs); intracellular signalling is mediated *via* the Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain. Trimeric TNFα binds to the cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) of the pre-assembled trimers of the TNF receptor (TNFR) and signalling is mediated *via* the receptor's death domain (DD). Finally, the IL-6R is a multimeric structure with IL-6R chains complexed with gp130. The ligand-binding region is within the fibronectin III (FNIII) modules of the IL-6R chains but signal transduction is *via* the associated gp130 molecules. Chemokine signalling occurs *via* activation of the seven transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). IL-8 binds to the extracellular face of either CXCR1 or CXCR2, triggering a conformational change that results in the activation of the G-proteins. Abbreviations: FNIII module, fibronectin III module; GAGs, glycosaminoglycans.

contrast, IL-1α is active in both its precursor and mature forms but typically remains in the nucleus, the cytoplasm, or on the cell membrane [9]. Despite these differences, IL-1α and IL-1β have similar affinities for the two IL-1 receptors, IL-1R1 and IL-1R2. The heterodimeric complex of IL-1R1 and the IL-1R accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) constitutes the functional receptor for IL-1 [10]. Normally, IL-1β binds first to IL-1R1 on the surface of target cells and then the IL-1RAcP is recruited, thus forming a trimolecular signalling complex (Fig. 1). IL-1R belongs to the IL-1R/TLR superfamily due to the presence a conserved cytoplasmic Toll/IL-1R (TIR) domain [10]. Following ligand binding, the adaptor molecule, MyD88, interacts with IL-1R1 *via* its TIR domain [10]. Signal transduction leads to activation of both mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and the transcription factor NF-κB, thereby resulting in pro-inflammatory cytokine expression. In addition to this classical signalling pathway, there is also evidence that regulated intramembrane proteolysis of IL-1R1 generates both a soluble ectodomain and an intracellular domain, with the latter directly modulating MAPK activation [11]. Thus, proteolytic processing of cytosolic receptors could contribute to signalling by a non-canonical mechanism.

The IL-1 family also includes members that have an inhibitory role, enabling them to suppress signalling and thereby limit inflammatory response. Firstly, IL-1R2 has a minimal intracellular domain that renders it inactive, and thus signalling is not induced following ligand binding. IL-1R2 is therefore thought to act as a decoy receptor, sequestering IL-1 in an anti-inflammatory mechanism [6]. Secondly, The IL-1R antagonist (IL-1Ra) is able to bind to the IL-1R1 and, in doing so, prevents the recruitment of IL-1RAcP [3], thereby inhibiting signal transduction. IL-1Ra is expressed as one of four different isoforms, generated by alternative splicing, including one secreted form (sIL-1Ra) and three cytosolic forms [12]. It is secreted by a number of cell types, including neutrophils, macrophages, monocytes and hepatocytes [12]. The sIL-1Ra is one of the acute phase proteins secreted by the liver in response to inflammatory stimuli [12]. Its absence is deleterious, with IL-1Ra-deficient mice being prone to the development of various inflammatory disorders and more susceptible to the effects of experimental immune challenges [13,14]. Despite this finding, the efficacy of IL-1Ra is thought to be much lower relative to that of agonist, resulting in the need for a up to 1000-fold excess IL-1RA in order to inhibit IL-1 signalling [15]. This is potentially due to the high level of IL-1R1 expression on most cells to which IL-1Ra may bind, while IL-1 itself need only bind a few receptors to trigger signal transduction [15]. Given that three of the

isoforms of IL-1Ra are intracellular, it has been hypothesised that the critical site of IL-1Ra could be a cytosolic location where it could block IL-1 expression or signalling by altering mRNA stability [12]. Thus, while IL-1Ra acts as a natural suppressor of inflammation, on its own it might be insufficient to quell IL-1 signalling and its function could be more complex, involving intracellular modulation of IL-1.

### 2.2. Tumour necrosis factor (TNFα)

The term tumour necrosis factor was initially conferred to two molecules, TNFα a monocyte-derived tumour necrosis factor, and TNFβ a lymphocyte-derived tumour necrosis factor, Tumour necrosis factor (TNFα) was initially identified in the 1970s as an endotoxin-induced serum factor responsible for the necrosis of certain tumours *in vivo* and *in vitro* [16]. Subsequently TNFα was isolated [17] and its gene cloned [18]. It is a potent inflammatory mediator that is central to the inflammatory action of the innate immune system, including induction of cytokine production, activation or expression of adhesion molecules, and growth stimulation [19–22]. It stimulates the proliferation of normal cells, exerts cytolytic or cytostatic activity against tumour cells, and causes inflammatory, antiviral, and immunoregulatory effects [23]. TNFα has also been shown to perform a number of additional functions linked with lipid metabolism, coagulation, insulin resistance, and endothelial function. Indeed, it has been shown to be one of the most important and pleiotropic cytokines mediating inflammatory and immune responses.

TNFα is the prototypic member of the TNF superfamily of type II transmembrane proteins that includes 30 receptors and 19 associated ligands with diverse functions in cell differentiation, inflammation, immunity and apoptosis [24]. It is primarily secreted from activated macrophages, although it may also be secreted by other cell types including monocytes, T cells, mast cells, NK cells, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and neurons [25]. TNFα is synthesised as a transmembrane precursor protein (mTNFα) with a molecular mass of 26 kDa [25], after which it is transported *via* the rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER), Golgi complex and the recycling endosome to the cell surface [26]. The monomers of TNFα associate at the plasma membrane as non-covalent trimers [27, 28] prior to being cleaved by the metalloprotease, TNFα converting enzyme (TACE or ADAM17) [29]. Cleavage by TACE results in the production of 17 kDa soluble TNFα (sTNFα) ectodomain and it is trimers of sTNFα that constitute the potent ligand that activates TNF receptors

Fig. 2. IL-1 signal transduction to NF-κB activation. IL-1 binds to the IL-1R, which associates with the IL-1RAcP at the cell surface, and signals via the TIR adaptor, MyD88, through homotypic TIR-TIR interactions. Subsequently, IL-1R associated kinases (IRAKs) are recruited to the receptor/MyD88 complex. Activated IRAKs promote TNFR-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) polyubiquitination via lysine 63 linkages. The polyubiquitinated TRAF6 interacts with TAK1 in complex with TAB1 and TAB2, ultimately leading to the phosphorylation of IκBα and its dissociation from NF-κB subunits. The phosphorylated IκBα is subsequently ubiquitinated for degradation by the proteasome. The phosphorylated p65/p50 heterodimer translocates to the nucleus, where it binds to response elements in NF-κB-dependent genes and leads to the induction of pro-inflammatory gene expression. In addition, the activation of TAK1/TAB1/TAB2 leads to the phosphorylation and activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), JNK and p38. These kinases then phosphorylate and activate transcription factors, thereby inducing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Abbreviations: IKK, IκB kinase; IκBα, inhibitor of κB; MyD88, myeloid differentiation factor 88; NF-κB, nuclear factor κB; TAB1, TAK1 binding protein 1; TAB2, TAK1 binding protein 2; TAK1, transforming growth factorβ-activated kinase 1.

[25]. Following TACE cleavage, the membrane stub is proteolytically processed by the signal peptide peptidases (SPPLs) SPPL2a and SPPL2b [30]. This cleavage produces an intracellular domain (ICD) that translocates to the nucleus and induces pro-inflammatory cytokine signalling, particularly the expression of IL-12 [30]. Thus, the precursor TNFα molecule is subjected to multiple cleavage events to release potent modulators of inflammation.

The molecular actions of extracellular sTNFα and mTNFα typically occur through binding to one of two receptors: TNFR1 (TNFRSF1A, p55TNFR1, p60, CD120a) and TNFR2 (TNFRSF1B, p75TNFR, p80 or CD120b) [25]. The receptors are expressed on different cell types, with TNFR1 being widely expressed, while TNFR2 is expressed predominantly on leukocytes and endothelial cells [31]. The two TNFRs have been reported to mediate distinct biological effects. Knockout mice for TNFRSF1A (TNFR1) are resistant to endotoxic shock, but they are much more susceptible than either TNFRSF1B (TNFR2) knockouts or wild type controls to challenge with *Listeria monocytogenes* [32]. Thus, pro-inflammatory effects of TNFα appear to be mediated predominantly through TNFR1.

Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are single transmembrane glycoproteins with 28% homology in their extracellular domains [27]. Common features in this region include four cysteine-rich domains (CRDs), each of which comprises three cysteine-cysteine disulphide bonds, and a pre-ligand binding assembly domain (PLAD) involved in trimerisation of the receptor [33]. Importantly, the receptors differ by the presence of an intracellular death domain (DD) at the carboxyl-end of TNFR1 [27] that is able to drive either apoptosis or inflammation through interaction with associated adaptor molecules (Fig. 3). Recruitment of TRADD to TNFR1 is required for both signalling pathways [34]. Subsequently, one of two complexes is formed, either at the cell surface (complex I) or following internalisation (complex II) [35]. The formation of complex I requires TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and receptor-interacting protein (RIP), leading to kinase cascades that trigger pro-inflammatory gene expression. Alternatively, should the first complex fail to signal, Complex II is formed to induce apoptosis [35]. In Complex II, proteolysis and internalisation of the receptor results in the recruitment of FADD and pro-caspase-8 to form the death-inducing signalling complex [35].

Unlike TNFR1, TNFR2 lacks a DD. However, it does possess an intracellular TRAF-binding motif, by which it too has the potential to modulate inflammatory status. The distinct cytoplasmic domains could account for the differential signalling of the receptors by sTNFα and mTNFα. It was found that mTNFα was a more potent activator of TNFR2 than sTNFα and induced distinct biological outcomes [36]. Further, activation of TNFR1 was found to stimulate NF-κB expression to a significantly greater extent than TNFR2 [37]. Finally, Scatchard analysis of ligand binding to TNFR1 and TNFR2 found that the former had a higher affinity for TNFα [38]. Thus, TNFR1 is considered to be the more important of the two receptors for the activation of pro-inflammatory signalling pathways.

Importantly, several cytokine receptors have been found to undergo ectodomain shedding by membrane-localised proteolytic enzymes. This process releases a soluble form of the receptor that can have a biological role such as limiting cytokine availability to other cells, and akin to that

Fig. 3. Signalling via the TNF receptors 1 and 2. Following TNFα binding to TNFR1, the receptor undergoes ectodomain shedding and internalisation, events which are linked to the intracellular signalling cascade. Ectodomain shedding is mediated by matrix metalloproteases resident in the plasma membrane and is followed by further proteolysis. Signalling following receptor internalisation is thought to pro-apoptotic signalling via the formation of Complex II (TRADD/FADD/Pro-Caspase-8). Alternatively, the recruitment of adaptor molecules to the cell surface prior to internalisation is thought to lead to the formation of Complex I (TRADD/TRAF2/RIP), followed by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades leading to transcription factor activation. JNK activates the AP1 heterodimer of c-Jun and Fos, while p38 activates numerous transcription factors; only CHOP and ATF2 are shown for clarity. In addition, Complex I signalling leads to IKK activation, which results in the phosphorylation and degradation of IkBα by the ubiquitin-proteasome system. The activated NF-κB heterodimer of p65/p50 can then migrate to the nucleus, bind to response elements and induce the expression of pro-inflammatory genes. Importantly, the outcome of the Complex I signalling pathways favour pro-inflammatory cytokine expression and cell survival. That said, it is well known that the MAPK JNK can also contribute to the induction of cell death. Abbreviations: CAMs, cellular adhesion molecules; DISC, death-inducing signalling complex; FADD, Fas-associated death domain protein; JNK, Jun N-terminal kinase; MMP, matrix metalloproteinase; RIP, receptor-interacting protein; TRADD, TNFR1-associated death domain protein; TRAF2, TNFR-associated protein 2.

discussed above for IL-1. Both TNFR1 and TNFR2 are cleaved by TACE following ligand binding, terminating the signal by decreasing availability of plasma membrane receptors as well as releasing soluble TNFR to sequester free TNFα [39,40]. The production of soluble TNFR1 has been described in inflammatory conditions [41]. As mentioned above, TNFR1 forms a trimer prior to ligand binding, which could lead to activation of signal transduction by bringing together the DD of the receptors. This can be suppressed by the association of the silencer of death domains (SODD) with the TNFR DD [42]. Following TNFα binding, SODD disassociates from TNFR, allowing adaptor molecules to be recruited [42]. Thus, there are intrinsic mechanisms to limit TNFR signalling in the absence of ligand, as well as to curtail signalling following ligand binding.

### 2.3. Interleukin-6 (IL-6)

The interleukin-6 (IL-6) family are pleiotropic cytokines that include the members IL-6 itself and IL-11 [43]. IL-6 is expressed by an array of cells, including mononuclear phagocytes, T cells, B cells, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, keratinocytes, hepatocytes, and bone marrow cells [44]. IL-6 is involved in haematopoiesis, and is critical in the final maturation of B-cells into antibody-producing plasma cells [45], T cell activation, differentiation and regulation of Th2 and Treg phenotypes [46,47]. It is also important in the secretion of acute phase proteins by the liver [48], which it does in cooperation with IL-1 [6]. Previous names for IL-6 illustrate some of these biological activities, including hepatocyte-stimulating factor (HSF), B-cell stimulatory factor 2 (BSF-2), and B cell differentiation factor (BCDF). The discovery and cloning of BSF-2 in 1986 [49] was followed by recognition of the fact that these diverse activities were due to a single cytokine, renamed IL-6 [45]. The gene encoding IL-6 was mapped to chromosome 7 in humans and it encodes a glycoprotein that ranges in mass from 21 to 28 kDa, depending on the extent of post-translational modification [50].

IL-6 signals through a ligand-binding IL-6 receptor (IL-6R) α chain (gp80, CD126) and the signal-transducing component gp130 (CD130) [43]. CD130 is the common signal transducer for several cytokines in the IL-6 family and is ubiquitously expressed [51], whereas the IL-6R subunit is typically restricted to lymphocytes and hepatocytes [52]. Following IL-6 binding, the signal is transduced by the gp130 chains to activate JAK-STAT signalling (Fig. 4). This signalling pathway leads to phosphorylation of STAT3, a member of the wider STAT family of transcription factors which are associated with cytokine signalling (Table 3), and results in STAT3 nuclear translocation and IL-6-responsive gene expression. In addition to the membrane-bound receptor, a soluble form of IL-6R (sIL-6R) is generated by TACE-mediated cleavage and can capture circulating IL-6 and make it available to bind and activate gp130 via a process of trans-signalling [43]. In contrast, a soluble form of gp130 functions as an anti-inflammatory decoy receptor, blocking sIL-6R trans-signalling [53]. More recently, the caspase-mediated cleavage of gp130 has been found to produce a small, 18 kDa C-terminal fragment and to thereby terminate IL-6 signal transduction, possibly leading to apoptosis [54]. Thus, a common theme

Fig. 4. IL-6 signalling pathway. The cytokine binds to the FIII domains of the IL-6R chains, ultimately activating signal transduction via the gp130 proteins. This leads to recruitment of janus kinases (JAKs) to the receptor, which phosphorylate the receptor and themselves. This leads to STAT3 phosphorylation and dimerization. Phosphorylated STAT3 dimers translocate to the nucleus and bind to an IFNγ activation site (GAS) in responsive genes. This leads to the transcription of pro-inflammatory genes and intracellular adhesion molecules.

cytokine signalling involves the proteolytic cleavage of the receptor to modulate signalling or produce a soluble ectodomain to bind to circulating ligands.

### 3. Chemokine signalling

Pro-inflammatory chemokines are produced by cells primarily to recruit leukocytes to the sites of infection or injury. Chemokines induce integrin expression, such as the β2-integrin lymphocyte function-associated antigen (LFA-1), in target leukocytes that act to arrest the rolling of these cells and favour diapedesis through the endothelium [55]. Although chemotaxis is the cardinal feature of chemokines, their physiological role is more complex, with many having additional homeostatic or housekeeping functions in hematopoiesis, initiation of adaptive immune responses and immune surveillance [56].

Initially chemokines were divided into groups based on having chemotactic or homeostatic function, but several dual-function chemokines have since been described [55]. To date, 44 chemokines and 23 chemokine receptors have been identified in the human genome [57]. It is the expression of particular chemokines, receptors, and adhesion molecules that contribute to the selective migration and tissue specificity of leukocytes. Chemokines are a group of small (8–12 kDa) proteins that are characterised by the presence of three to four conserved cysteine residues. They can be subdivided into four families based on the positioning of the N-terminal cysteine residues (Table 4). The C–X–C subfamily is characterised by the separation of the first two cysteines by a variable amino acid, while in the C–C subfamily the cysteine residues are adjacent to each other. The majority of the known chemokines are contained in the CXC and C–C subfamilies but two additional chemokine subgroups have been described. The third group of chemokines (the C subfamily) lacks the first and third cysteines and thus possesses only a single cysteine residue in the conserved position. This subfamily includes the lymphocyte-specific chemotactic peptide XCL1 (lymphotactin) [58]. A fourth subfamily (CX3C) has the two N-terminal cysteine residues separated by three variable amino acids [59]. In humans, this family has only one member: CX3CL1 (fractalkine), which is unique in possessing a mucin-like glycosylated stalk that allows it to exist as a soluble or membrane-bound chemokine [59].

Chemokine signals are transduced through binding to members of the seven-transmembrane, G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) superfamily [56], although there is also evidence that other effector pathways are possible [60]. There is heterogeneity in chemokine receptor expression in cells and they can form multiple complexes, such as the demonstration that CXCR4 and CCR5 can heterodimerise when stimulated with their respective ligands [61]. The G proteins associate with the carboxyl terminus of the receptor and signal-induced conformational changes activates G protein-mediated signalling [60]. In addition, there are a number of decoy receptors for chemokines that are not coupled to G proteins and so cannot signal, including: duffy antigen receptor for chemokines (DARC), D6, and CCX-CKR [62]. Decoy chemokine receptors are generally thought to play a role in dampening the

two general subgroups (ELR and non-ELR) based upon the presence or absence of the amino acid motif (Glu-Leu-Arg) immediately preceding the first cysteine [65]. The ELR-positive chemokines (CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL5, CXCL6, CXCL7, and CXCL8/IL-8) are angiogenic and act mainly through the CXCR2 receptor [66]. The ELR motif, along with the CXC residues, is required for receptor activation [66]. By contrast, the non-ELR chemokines (CXCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11 and CXCL17) are angiostatic and act mainly through the CXCR3B receptor [67]. The exception to this is CXCL12, which is a non-ELR chemokine but is angiogenic and exerts its effects on the vasculature primarily by binding to CXCR4 and CXCR7 [78]. The role of chemokines thus extends beyond chemotaxis to include contributions to vascularisation and angiogenesis in cancer.

Chemokine release from cells can also trigger the destructive invasion of immune cells into essential tissues and organs. This occurs in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes where glucotoxicity activates pancreatic β-cell NLRP3 inflammasomes [69], thereby driving production and release of IL-1β [70]. This then acts in an autocrine manner, binding the β-cell IL1R and triggering the activation of the transcription factor NF-κB [70]. This results in the synthesis and release of a host of other cytokines and chemokines from islet cells [81]. These molecules trigger infiltration of the pancreas by macrophages and other immune cells [72]. Together this toxic cocktail of endogenous and immune cell released cytokines results in the apoptotic destruction of insulin secreting β-cells [73,74].

### 3.1. Interleukin-8 (IL-8)

Also known as CXCL8, IL-8 is one of the most widely studied chemokines and is a critical inflammatory mediator. It was originally identified for its role in chemoattraction of neutrophils, for which it was named neutrophil chemotactic factor (NCF) and neutrophil activating protein (NAP-1) [75,76]. The IL-8 genomic structure was first mapped in the late 1980s [77]. The IL-8 protein is 6–8 kDa in molecular mass and belongs to a subdivision of the CXC chemokines [78]. It acts as an angiogenic factor in human microvascular endothelial cells [79]. The main role of IL-8 in inflammation is in the recruitment of neutrophils [80], although it is also responsible for the chemotactic migration and activation of monocytes, lymphocytes, basophils, and eosinophils at sites of inflammation [75]. IL-8 can be found in either monomeric or dimeric forms and both are required for neutrophil activation, albeit with distinct kinetics [81]. Further, the binding of dimers to glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is more efficient and therefore facilitates binding to endothelial cells, as well as binding to the CXCR1/2 on the neutrophils [81]. Indeed, heparin was found to be the only GAG associated with IL-8 to induce neutrophil chemotaxis [82]. Although IL-8 can bind to both CXCR1 and CXCR2, it has been found that chemotactic signalling is primarily via CXCR1 [78,80]. Following binding to CXCR1 or CXCR2, a number of intracellular signalling cascades are activated within the target cells to induce chemotaxis and degranulation (Fig. 5). These cascades are initiated primarily via the activation of intracellular G proteins, resulting in the dissociation of the proteins from the receptor and separation of the Gα and Gβγ subunits. The G protein subunits then stimulate enzymes (adenylate cyclase or phospholipase C) that can activate MAPK signalling and alter gene expression to promote cell survival, proliferation and inflammation. Importantly, the production of 3,4,5-inositol triphosphate (IP3) triggers the release of intracellular calcium stores that stimulate degranulation. Neutrophil granules contain several effector molecules, such as the antimicrobial proteins myeloperoxidase, defensins and lysozyme [83]. In addition, IL-8 signalling via MAPK and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K) induces the expression of adhesion molecules such as the integrin, Mac-1, that are required for chemotaxis [84]. Thus, IL-8 mediates the recruitment and activation of neutrophils via complex signalling mechanisms and extracellular adhesion molecules.

Fig. 5. IL-8 signalling pathway. IL-8 is thought to exist as monomers in the plasma but that local concentrations in the tissues favours dimer formation and these dimers are modified by the addition of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The GAGs facilitate binding of IL-8 to endothelial cells; they can then bind to a slow progression of migrating lymphocytes. Binding of IL-8 to the chemokine receptors CXCR1 or CXCR2 leads to activation of the heterotrimeric G-proteins (Ga, β, γ). The Ga subunit in particular activates the membrane-bound adenylate cyclase (AC), which generates cyclic AMP (cAMP) and cAMP can then activate protein kinase A (PKA). Alternatively, the Gβγ heterodimer can dissociate from the Ga subunit and stimulate phospholipase β (PLCβ) activity, which cleaves phospholipids to produce inositol 3,4,5-triphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG activates PKC, which then induces MAPK activation, whereas IP3 triggers the degranulation by stimulating the release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores.

4. Cytokines and chemokines in inflammation

Several diseases have been described in which aberrant or excessive signalling by cytokines contributes to pathogenesis [85]. For example, up-regulation of IL-1 and IL-6 has been observed in a variety of chronic inflammatory and autoimmune disorders such as type I diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus nephritis, psoriasis and systemic sclerosis [86–90]. It is well established that TNFα is directly involved in the pathology of several systemic diseases (Fig. 6), as well as affecting disease pathology through more localised effect. Importantly, appropriate levels of TNFα are also essential to perform key homeostatic functions, exerting a variety of effects on normal cell function, including cell proliferation, necrosis and apoptosis [27]. TNFα serves a key function in orchestrating the inflammatory response [31] that includes both systemic and local responses. TNFα actions include triggering the vascular endothelial cell expression of lipid mediators that promote tissue oedema, as well as leukocyte adhesion molecules that stimulate immune cell infiltration. For example, the early induction of chemokine expression and lymphocyte infiltration in response to microbial infection is due to the actions of TNFα [91]. A number of large studies have shown the efficacy of anti-TNFα therapy in inflammatory diseases. Importantly, insight into the central function of TNFα in synovial inflammation led to the development of TNFα blockers, which have proven to be highly effective therapeutics [92].

Specific chemokines and their receptors have also been found to be elevated in the tissues of patients with inflammatory conditions (Table 5). IL-8 can be detected in synovial fluid from patients with various inflammatory rheumatic diseases [93], and mucosal levels of IL-8 are elevated in patients with active ulcerative colitis [94]. Elevated levels of CC chemokines, particularly CCL2, CCL3, and CCL5 in the joints of

Importantly, proteinuria is observed in FMF patients and is highly suggestive of amyloidosis. Secondary amyloidosis (AA) is the main and potentially lethal complication of the disease. In patients with phenotype II FMF, secondary amyloidosis (AA) is observed and patients typically have two mutations in the FMF-associated gene (*Mefv*). Recently, a population study in Turkey identified 27 allelic variants among 22 patients with phenotype II MEFV [109]. Most patients with overt clinical disease bear two mutations of *MEFV*; however, it has been recently emphasised that in a subset of patients, only one mutation can be detected [110]. Further to this, some heterozygotes displayed inflammatory symptoms typical of FMF [111–113]. Given the traditional classification of FMF as a recessive disorder, this finding is somewhat surprising and the above findings suggest that FMF could be inherited as a dominant trait, though with reduced penetrance. The presence of multiple allelic variants further suggests that inheritance of FMF could be due to more than one *Mefv* mutation.

The *Mefv* gene product, pyrin, is a member of the tripartite motif family (TRIM20) with a conserved C-terminal PRYSPRY domain in which several of the common mutations observed in FMF are located [114]. It is hypothesised that wild-type pyrin acts as a suppressor of inflammation and that mutation of pyrin leads to a loss of suppression. Consistent with this hypothesis and the aforementioned elevation in inflammation in patients, the knockout the *Mefv* gene locus in a mouse model and the consequent loss of pyrin expression resulted in elevated levels of IL-1 [115]. Thus, the complete loss of pyrin would result in the absence of a normal inhibitor of inflammation. However, FMF is characterised by an array of allelic variations that result in mutations in pyrin, rather than its complete absence. Thus, the symptoms of FMF are hypothesised to be due to these mutations rendering pyrin less effective at inhibiting inflammation, with a range of severity depending upon the given mutation. However, the data do not rule out the hypothesis that some mutations in pyrin could result in a gain of function such that the mutant pyrin could actively promote the pro-inflammatory pathway or suppress the anti-inflammatory arm. A further aspect of pyrin's biology could be important in this context, as all of the current evidence suggests that pyrin functions in the context of large protein complexes. In such complexes, the inclusion of molecules with reduced function could potentially compromise complex function.

### 5. Inflammatory disorders and therapeutic strategies

#### 5.1. Auto-inflammatory disorders

The relatively new category of auto-inflammatory disorders comprises a group of inherited diseases of the innate immune system. The core group consists of six disorders which are also known as hereditary recurrent fever syndromes. While auto-inflammatory disorders share similarities with autoimmune diseases, they represent a distinct category of disorders that are characterised by intense episodes of inflammation that result in fever, rash, or joint swelling. These diseases also carry the risk of amyloidosis which results in a potentially fatal accumulation of protein in organs.

The most prevalent auto-inflammatory disorder is Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), but several other such disorders have been described. These disorders include: tumour necrosis factor receptor associated periodic syndrome (TRAPS), mevalonate kinase deficiencies (MKD), severe mevalonic aciduria (MA), moderate hyperimmunoglobulin D and periodic fever syndrome (HIDS), Muckle Wells syndrome (MWS), familial cold urticaria (FCU) which is also known as familial cold-associated syndrome (FCAS), and neonatal-onset multisystemic inflammatory disease (NOMID) syndrome [99]. Finally, an autoinflammatory disorder associated with deficiency of IL-1Ra (DIRA) has been described [100]. All of these auto-inflammatory disorders have a common clinical feature in intermittent episodes of heightened systemic or local inflammation, as well as a common mechanism in aberrant innate immune system function. Here, we shall describe FMF, TRAPS, NOMID and DIRA in more detail, detailing how cytokine and chemokines contribute to the symptoms of the diseases.

##### 5.1.1. Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF)

FMF is characterised by recurrent attacks of fever and serositis with significant acute-phase inflammation [101]. The age of FMF onset is typically before five years, with over 90% of patients becoming symptomatic within the first two decades of life. The diagnosis of FMF is made based on the clinical symptoms during a bout of the illness. Typically, an attack has a sudden onset with high fever and lasts from some hours to 3–4 days; the frequency varies from once per week to once every few years. The signs of acute serosal inflammation include peritonitis (90%), pleuritis (45%), scrotitis (5%) and pericarditis (1%), with erysipelas-like skin lesions reported in 7–40% of patients. There is also evidence of increased neutrophil infiltration in the affected tissues [102]. Typical laboratory findings during an attack include leukocytosis, an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and increased acute phase reactants (serum amyloid A, fibrinogen, C-reactive protein) [103–105]. Several studies have now shown that these components are also elevated between attacks in FMF patients [106–108]. This indicates that though their overt attacks are self-limited in nature, FMF patients experience subclinical inflammation when asymptomatic.

analysis of the ten exons of TNFRSF1A identified six different missense mutations in patients that were not present in controls; five of these mutations involved highly-conserved cysteine residues that were present in all 40 symptomatic patients and in only two asymptomatic family members. Thus, the discovery of mutations in TNFRSF1A led to a consolidation of these diseases under the name TRAPS.

There are currently over 90 reported mutations in TNFRSF1A leading to TRAPS (INFEVERS TRAPS database http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/infevers). An early indication of functional mechanism linked to TRAPS pathophysiology came from the demonstration of defective receptor shedding from peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from patients possessing the C52F mutation in TNFR1 [122]. The situation is not straightforward however, as multiple modes of TNFR1 trafficking dysfunction have since been reported [123]. However all are thought to alter activity of the transcription factor NF-κB (Fig. 7), although distinct differences in NF-κB subunit activity profiles have been reported for some of these mutations. Specifically, in addition to p65/p50 heterodimer subunit activity, the R92Q mutation has been shown to lead to increased activity of the NF-κB p50/p50 subunit homodimer [124]. Thus, the low disease penetrance associated with this mutation could be due to a repressive function of the p50/p50 homodimer. More recent work has shown that whilst p65 subunit activity is elevated by different TRAPS mutations, c-Rel subunit activity is also elevated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from TRAPS patients with F60L and Δ42 mutations [125]. Interestingly, while high p65 activity was associated with elevated IL-8 secretion, high c-Rel activity increased IL-1β and IL-12 secretion. Different TRAPS mutations therefore generate distinct NF-κB family subunit activities and this, in turn, results in the generation of unique cytokine secretory profiles [125]. Thus, it would appear that the NF-κB p65 and c-Rel subunits function as independent pro-inflammatory mediators in TRAPS, promoting the secretion of different cytokines. Together, these actions synergise to generate the increased inflammation observed in TRAPS.

Since the discovery that TNFRSF1A gene mutations drive TRAPS pathology a major area of clinical focus has revolved around development of anti-TNFα biologics. Etanercept (Enbrel®; manufactured by Pfizer Inc.), a chimeric fusion protein coupling soluble TNFR2 to the IgG1 constant region, was the first anti-TNFα drug successfully used to treat TRAPS patients. Although relatively well tolerated, etanercept is however ineffective in some patients [126] and in others becomes less effective with repeat doses [127]. Infliximab (Remicade®, manufactured by Janssen Biotech, Inc.), a chimeric anti-TNF monoclonal antibody, has also been administered to patients with TRAPS. However not only are there a number of potentially dangerous side effects to the drug, but certain TRAPS mutations are actually associated with an acute inflammatory response to infliximab, most likely due to constitutive signalling resulting from failure to remove infliximab-bound TNF/TNFR1 from the cell surface of cells of peripheral blood mononuclear cells where the TRAPS-associated mutation in TNFRSF1A is associated with a shedding defect [128].

TNFRSF1A mutation and downstream NF-κB activation result in increased levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, in both serum and peripheral mononuclear cells of TRAPS patients [125,129]. The recombinant human IL-1R1 antagonist, anakinra (Kineret®; manufactured by Swedish Orphan Biovitrum), has therefore been administered to TRAPS patients in an attempt to reduce inflammatory episodes. Initial findings indicate sustained beneficial action of this drug in the treatment of TRAPS [130,131]. However, as with all anti-cytokine therapies care will need to be taken to investigate potentially damaging effects of repeated administration. Indeed, it should be noted that low concentrations of IL-1β actually have a positive physiological effect on proliferation of certain cell types, such as pancreatic β-cells, and that

B) The R92Q variant of TNFR1 induces activation of the p50/p50 homodimer, leading to repression of NF-κB-dependent gene expression. However p50 can form dimers with Bcl-3, which has a transactivation domain and thus can induce inflammatory gene expression. Further partners can be recruited to the p50/Bcl-3 heterodimer, leading to the activation of numerous off-target genes.

pharmacological IL-1β deficiency leads to a reduction in cell proliferation and secretory function in these cells [132].

### 5.1.3. Neonatal onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID)

NOMID, also known as chronic infantile neurologic cutaneous articular (CINCA) syndrome, belongs to the cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS). It affects numerous organs and body systems, including the skin, joints, eyes, and the CNS. For most children, the first sign of the disease is a rash that develops within the first six weeks of life. Other problems can follow, including fever, meningitis, joint damage, vision and hearing loss and mental retardation. The disease is the most severe CAPS disorder and frequently results in death in affected children [133]. While the mechanism of NOMID is not completely understood, research has revealed mutations in the NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain 3) gene (formerly known as CIAS1) in approximately 60% of patients with the disease [134]. NLRP3 encodes cryopyrin, which combines with caspase-1 and ASC to form the inflammasome complex that cleaves pro-IL-1β to generate its mature form [135]. These mutations typically result in excessive secretion of IL-1β [136, 137]. Thus, patients with NOMID usually respond well to anakinra, resulting in marked improvement both in symptoms and the underlying inflammation. Likewise, other patients with CAPS disorders show improved symptoms with anakinra [138–140].

The short half-life of anakinra necessitates daily injections and injection site reactions are commonly observed [138–141]. Newer therapeutics with improved pharmacokinetics and tolerance have been developed. Rilonacept (Arcalyst™; Regeneron Pharmaceuticals) is an artificial molecule that contains the ligand-binding portions of both IL-1R1 and IL-1AcP fused to a dimeric molecule containing the Fc segment of hlgG1 (human immunoglobulin G1) [142]. It thus acts by binding to IL-1 with an affinity at least 100-fold higher than that of the native IL-1R complex, thereby preventing IL-1 binding to cell surface receptors [142]. In contrast to anakinra, rilonacept has a half-life of approximately seven days and thus is administered once weekly [143]. Rilonacept has been approved by the FDA for the treatment of CAPS and it has proven very effective and safe in a small open-label pilot study patients with FCAS and MWS [144,145]. In addition to improving symptoms of the disease, rilonacept also reduced serum levels of serum amyloid A (SAA) [143,145]. The latter is of great importance given that high serum levels of SAA are directly related to the risk of developing secondary amyloidosis [108], the main cause of renal insufficiency in these patients. Injection site reactions and upper respiratory tract infections were the two most commonly observed adverse events in patients treated with rilonacept [143].

A third IL-1 blocker, the monoclonal human anti-IL-1β canakinumab (Ilaris®, manufactured by Novartis Pharmaceuticals), was used in patients with CAPS in one small study [146] and in a randomised placebo-control clinical trial [147]. Canakinumab was administered subcutaneously once every eight weeks and induced a remarkable clinical response with normalisation of SAA and C-reactive protein levels [147]. During the treatment period, only two adverse events were observed – a case of urosepsis and an episode of vertigo [147].

### 5.1.4. Deficiency of interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA)

DIRA was recently reported as a new autosomal recessive autoinflammatory disease caused by mutations of *IL1RN*, the gene encoding the IL-1 receptor antagonist, with prominent involvement of skin and bone [100]. Children with this disorder display a constellation of serious and potentially fatal symptoms, including swelling of bone tissue, bone pain and deformity, inflammation of the periosteum and a rash that can span from small individual pustules to extensive pustulosis that covers most of the patient's body. Most of the children begin to have symptoms from birth to 2 weeks of age. Although it has only recently been described, there is evidence from previous case studies that could be describing DIRA, with severe infantile chronic multifocal osteomyelitis and pustulosis [148]. In the absence of functional IL-1Ra, patients cannot control systemic inflammation caused by IL-1 signalling [149]. Although mutations that cause DIRA are rare there are nonetheless hotspots, with for instance 2.5% of the population of north-west Puerto Rico being carriers [149]. Since DIRA is recessively inherited, these data suggest that it may be present in about 1 in 6,300 births in this population. Mutations may also be more common in individuals of Dutch descent. Given the basis of the disease in the absence of IL-1Ra, it is not surprising that the recombinant IL-1Ra drug, anakinra, has been successful in treating the symptoms of DIRA.

##### 5.2.1. Inflammatory bowel diseases

Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD), including Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), are characterised by chronic, self-destructive inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract [150]. In both UC and CD, leukocyte infiltration into the intestine is fundamental to disease development and progression, with chemokines and their receptors mediating tissue-specific and cell type-selective trafficking of leukocytes [151]. Several chemokine pathways have been identified as being central to the physiopathology of IBD, including the CCL20–CCR6 and CCL25–CCR9 ligand/receptor combinations [152]. Recently, the selective removal of leukocytes expressing CCR9 by using CCL25 as bait resulted in substantial improvement in clinical symptoms in IBD [153]. In addition, the homeostatic and inflammatory roles of the CX3CL1–CX3CR1 and CXCL10–CXCR3 pathways offer promising molecular targets for therapeutic intervention [152]. There is also evidence of cytokine activation in the mucosal immune system [154,155], with increased levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, and TNFα. Based on these observations a rationale for anti-TNFα and other anti-cytokine therapy was defined, and clinical studies have led to some promising results [156–159]. A number of large studies have also shown the efficacy of TNFR and anti-TNFα therapy in RA and Crohn's disease [160–163].

##### 5.2.2. Allergic diseases and asthma

Aberrant regulation of chemokine expression has been implicated in a number of diseases including allergy and asthma (Table 5). Inflammation is also a key factor in asthma, in which the chemokine CCL11 (eotaxin) and its receptor, CCR3, contribute to the recruitment of eosinophils to the lung [164]. Increased chemokine levels have been observed in asthmatic patient bronchoalveolar lavage and biopsy samples [165,166], including CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, CCL7, CCL11, CCL13, CCL24, /IL-8, and CXCL10. In addition, murine models of asthma have implicated chemokine induction of AHR and cellular emigration through CCL2, CCL5, CCL11, CXCL10, and CXCL12 in airway inflammation [167,168]. Furthermore, the chemokine CCL11 (eotaxin) and its receptor, CCR3, contribute to the recruitment of eosinophils to the lung [164].

The C–C chemokine family has been extensively studied in allergic diseases because of their ability to recruit eosinophils, T cells, and monocytes to regions of inflammation. CCL5 and CCL11 are the most important eosinophil chemoattractants in allergic inflammation [169]. Aside from production by eosinophils, macrophages, mast cells, and T cells, CCL5 and CCL11 are produced by structural cells of the airway, including airway smooth muscle and fibroblasts. In addition to lymphoid tissue, nasal epithelial cells express CCL17 (TARC), and expression of this chemokine and its receptor, CCR4, was higher in patients with allergic rhinitis compared with that seen in nonallergic control subjects. Both IL-4 and IL-13 promote CCL17 expression, leading to a Th2 response [170]. This is relevant in allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA), in which increased serum levels of CCL17 predict ABPA exacerbations better than IgE levels [171]. CCL17 levels might also serve as a marker of ABPA in patients with cystic fibrosis [172].

IL8 is derived primarily from mononuclear phagocytes, endothelial and epithelial cells, but is also produced by T cells, eosinophils, neutrophils, fibroblasts, keratinocytes, hepatocytes, and chondrocytes.

synthesis can be induced by LPS, IL-1, TNFα, or viral infection [173, 174]. On a molar basis, IL8 is one of the most potent chemoattractants for neutrophils in addition to stimulating the neutrophil respiratory burst and adherence to endothelial cells through CXCR1 [174]. However, a number of additional chemokines also contribute to allergic inflammation, with different Th cell responses and temporal contributions reflecting a complex series of interactions. For example, in asthmatic lungs CXCL10 and CXCL13 are induced at different times after allergen exposure, with CXCL10 produced in early phases, and CXCL13 only induced after secondary and subsequent exposures [175]. This likely reflects the cellular sources of these cytokines, with airway epithelial cells producing CXCL10, whereas CXCL13 is produced by Th17, but not Th1 or Th2, cells. It is thus tempting to speculate that Th17 cells might play a role in asthma in later exposures after the allergic phenotype has already been established. T cell subsets that might have regulatory activity are being identified, and chemokines and their receptors appear to have important roles in mediating activity and migration of these cells. Among CD4⁺CD25⁺Foxp3⁺ nTreg cells, there appears to be at least 2 subgroups that can be distinguished based on CCR6 expression. Those that are high in CCR6 seem to have regulatory activity, whereas those low in CCR6 secrete Th2 cytokines on stimulation with bacterial superantigen [176]. Another group has demonstrated low levels of XCR1 on the surface of CD4⁺CD25hiCD127low Treg cells isolated from allergic asthmatic subjects compared with those from healthy control subject [177]. Although in a relatively early stage, this emerging field of chemokine response and expression by Treg cells will hopefully clarify many of the questions about how these cells work.

### 5.2.3. Behçet's disease

Behçet's disease (BD) is a multi-centre inflammatory disease, with symptoms including oral and genital canker sores or ulcers and ocular inflammation. In some patients, the disease also results in arthritis, skin problems, and inflammation of the digestive tract, brain, and spinal cord [178]. Behçet's disease is common in the Middle East, Asia, and Japan, although it is rare in the United States. In Middle Eastern and Asian countries, the disorder affects more men than women, while in the United States the opposite is true. Behçet's disease tends to develop in patients in their twenties or thirties. Whilst the precise cause of Behçet's disease is currently unknown, the majority of symptoms result from inflammation of blood vessels. Serum levels of several cytokines are elevated, including IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, IL-18, and TNFα [179, 180], while IL-15 levels in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) were higher in patients with BD of patients than in patients in remission or healthy controls [181]. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive drugs are commonly used to treat the disease.

It has been demonstrated that there is a polarisation of the T cell response in BD towards the production of type I cytokines (a Th1 response) [182, 183]. Previous work showed a preponderance of the CXCR3⁺ CD3⁺ subset of Th1 cells in BD [183]. The γδ T cells have a non-redundant role in immune responses, particularly to bacterial infections. They also make potent anti-tumour responses and have been implicated in various autoimmune diseases. Patients with BD have increased numbers of γδ T cells in circulation and in mucosal lesions [184]. In one study there was an elevated number of the Vγ9Vδ2 subset of γδ T cells in the intraocular fluid of BD patients with uveitis [185]. The γδ T cells in BD have an activated phenotype, expressing markers such as CD25, CD29, and CD69, and producing pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-γ, TNFα, and IL-8 [182]. Further, the γδ T cells from BD patients proliferate in response to mycobacterial HSP-derived peptides and in response to products from microorganisms in oral ulcers [184, 186]. Importantly, γδ T cells also proliferate in the presence of IL-12 and it has been demonstrated that serum levels of IL-12 are increased in BD [187]. In addition to T cells, it is likely that antigen-presenting cells (APCs) contribute to BD by the cytokines they secrete, including IL-12 and IL-18; the former contributes to T cell activation, while the latter has been shown to stimulate neutrophils [182]. Indeed, the combined effects of APCs and γδ T cells are thought to lead to neutrophil hyperactivity [182]. Neutrophils are hyperactive in BD, with increased chemotaxis, phagocytosis, superoxide production, and myeloperoxidase expression, as well as producing several cytokines, including IL-12 [188, 189]. Given the aforementioned responsiveness of the γδ T cells in BD, this additional secretion of IL-12 by neutrophils is likely to exacerbate the symptoms.

#### 5.2.4. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)

Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease characterised by the presence of autoantibodies (rheumatoid factors) and chronic inflammation that leads to tissue destruction [92]. A role for dysregulation of cytokines in the synovial tissues was identified early on as a potential factor in RA pathogenesis [190]. This led to the discovery that anti-TNFα antibodies inhibited the production of IL-1 in these tissues and the suggestion that TNFα induced IL-1 production by synovial cells [191]. At around the same time, elevation in TNFα was linked to the pathogenesis of polyarthritis in mice [192]. Importantly, this study also demonstrated that administration of an anti-TNFα monoclonal antibody prevented development of the disease in these animals. Subsequently, the expression of both TNFR1 and TNFR2 was found to be upregulated in synovial tissues of patients with RA [193]. Combined with the prior observations, this evidence established TNFα as the key pathogenic cytokine in RA.

Chimeric anti-TNFα monoclonal antibodies were developed for clinical trials in humans and found to be highly successful in improving markers of RA in patients [194]. The chimeric monoclonal antibody, infliximab, was subsequently approved for use in the treatment of RA [92]. In addition, other monoclonal anti-TNFα therapeutics have been developed with various modifications to improve efficacy or safety, such as the recombinant, fully-human antibody adalimumab [92]. Intensive research on the role played by cytokines in RA has thus led to advances in therapeutics, particularly the development of novel anti-TNFα therapies.

The BeSt trial revealed that several patients with early RA receiving infliximab (TNFα blockade) with methotrexate were able to stop treatment (if they reached a low disease activity state without subsequent disease flare) [195]. Remarkably, a proportion of patients remained in clinical remission for up to 4 years, with a small number (14%) being drug-free (i.e., not being treated with disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)) [195]. Currently, the outcome of such trials is leading clinicians to question whether treatment with anti-TNFα therapeutics can eventually lead to remission and the ability to discontinue the use of such agents in patients who have achieved remission [196]. For some patients on adalimumab or infliximab with methotrexate who have been in remission for an extended period of time, discontinuation of the treatment could be feasible [196].

While TNFα clearly has a pivotal role in RA, several other cytokines are present in the synovial tissue and could also contribute to pathogenesis. Among these is IL-6, which signals via a JAK-STAT pathway. Recently, an inhibitor of JAK signalling has been developed and this is now approved for use in the treatment of moderate to severe RA. The small molecule JAK inhibitor, tofacitinib (Xeljanz® manufactured by Pfizer Inc.), is to be used initially as a second-line therapy for patients who fail to respond to methotrexate or anti-TNFα biologicals [197]. Thus, the early success of TNFα inhibition is serving as a model for developing other treatments of RA that target cytokine signalling pathway components to limit inflammation.

Whilst blockade of TNFα is often beneficial in the short-term, it is not curative, and its effects are often only partial and non-responsiveness is also common. Moreover, loss of effect has been observed. Despite advances in the treatment of RA, particularly the anti-cytokine therapeutics, it is still a formidable clinical problem with the risk of progressive articular damage (radiographic progression), functional decline and comorbidities remain for many patients. Crucially, there is as yet little evidence that we can re-establish immunologic tolerance and hence

883 aim for drug-free remission on a regular basis. Drug responses and toxicities remain idiosyncratic, with few reliable biomarkers for prognostic or therapeutic purposes having been identified thus far. One therapeutic strategy would be to evaluate and target specific cytokines present at particular stages of the disease. Alternatively, the combination of anti-TNFα therapeutics with other drugs, such as the new JAK inhibitor [197], could result in improved clinical outcomes.

### 5.3. Neurological disorders involving inflammation

Inflammation is a process that is implicated in the onset of various neurodegenerative diseases. Over the last decade increasing knowledge has emerged on the role of cytokines in brain physiology. As for other organs, excessive cytokine expression in the brain is harmful and has been associated with neurological disorders, including both Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease (PD). As will be discussed below, these complex neurodegenerative disorders are associated with complicated, multifactorial changes in inflammatory molecules.

#### 5.3.1. Alzheimer's disease

The molecular and cellular mechanisms responsible for the aetiology and pathogenesis of AD have been widely studied and several hypotheses advanced. While the hypotheses differ in the initiating trigger for the disease, inflammation within the brain is thought to play a pivotal role. Studies suggest that peripheral infection or inflammation could also affect the inflammatory state of the central nervous system (CNS). This includes chronic periodontitis, which has been associated with several systemic diseases such as AD [198]. Other hypotheses include the outcome of viral infection of the CNS triggering either a chronic inflammatory state or even inducing autoimmune dysfunction within the brain. Chronic infection with herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) and its reactivation from latency are associated with AD pathology [199,200]. In addition, activation of TLRs on microglia by bacterial infections in the CNS can contribute to neuronal cell death and AD symptoms [201]. Thus the initiating trigger could be either localised infection in, or the impact of peripheral inflammation on, the CNS.

The pathology of AD is characterised by proteinaceous lesions within the brain as well as by neuronal loss. Pathological lesions such as amyloid plaques containing the cleaved Aβ protein and neurofibrillary tangles containing tau protein are frequently observed in the brains of AD patients [202]. Emerging evidence suggests that inflammatory responses contribute to the progression of AD, accelerating the course of the disease. Under the influence of IL-1 originating from activated microglia, astrocytes in neurite plaques were found to over-express the neurotrophic calcium binding protein, S100B [203]. Overexpression of S100B has been found to accelerate AD-like pathology in a transgenic mouse model [204]. Additionally, the expression of α1-antichymotrypsin (ACT), a protein associated with amyloid plaques in AD [205], was found to increase in response to the treatment of astrocytes with IL-1 and IL-6 [206]. AD brains were also found to have high levels of nitrous oxide synthase (NOS)-positive astrocytes compared to controls [207], suggesting increased production of NO in the AD brain. In support of this, Aβ peptides induced astrocytes to produce IL-1β, NOS mRNA and NO [208]. More recently, a feed-forward mechanism was proposed, whereby Aβ activation of astrocytes results in the production of APP and the BACE enzyme responsible for Aβ cleavage, generating more peptides that contribute to plaque formation [209].

Regardless of the cause, inflammation in the CNS involves the activation of microglia and astrocytes, resulting in the release of inflammatory mediators such as cytokines, chemokines, neurotransmitters and reactive oxygen species (ROS) [210]. Microglia are particularly important in the CNS immune response and are generally thought to be neuroprotective, with resting microglia becoming activated in the presence of pathogens, damaged cells and cell debris, and functioning to clear perceived danger signals to protect neurons [211]. However there is also evidence that microglia can have neurotoxic effects in the brain [212],

likely via the release of potent pro-inflammatory molecules [213] and other immunomodulatory molecules which lead to the recruitment of monocytes and lymphocytes through the blood-brain barrier (BBB) [214,215]. This leads to activation of additional microglia and also promotes their proliferation, thereby amplifying the release of inflammatory factors [216].

Soluble Aβ oligomers are thought to activate microglia via stimulation of innate immune receptors [212], thus triggering the above-mentioned inflammatory process. Amyloid plaques are also thought to attract and activate microglia, leading to clustering of microglia around Aβ deposit sites in the brain [217]. Microglia also express scavenger receptors that mediate adhesion of the microglia to Aβ fibril-coated surfaces, thus leading to ROS secretion and cell immobilisation [218]; the secretion of ROS is particularly associated with neuronal damage since it can cause lipid and protein cross-linking and consequent loss of function. Microglia activated by Aβ secrete elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [213,219], the latter enhancing the ability of peripheral monocytes to pass through the BBB [220]. Microglia exposed to Aβ can also be activated through receptors for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) [221]. M-CSF induces further microglial chemotaxis towards Aβ, and also increased macrophage scavenger receptor expression. Interestingly, removal of M-CSF from cultures resulted in apoptosis of microglia [222], whilst treatment of microglia with anti-RAGE F(ab′)2 resulted in decreased secretion of M-CSF and reduced chemotaxis towards Aβ [221]. This would seem to suggest that therapeutic strategies that employ similar rationales might offer patients with AD an improved prognosis.

The presence of microglia around Aβ plaques is not necessarily detrimental however, as M-CSF induction of microglia to the parenchyma of Swedish β-amyloid precursor protein (APPswe)/PS1 transgenic mice has been shown to decrease the number of Aβ deposits and prevent cognitive loss compared to vehicle controls [223]. These findings support the view that M-CSF stimulates and attracts bone marrow-derived microglia into the CNS, and induces neuroprotective functions in microglia leading to Aβ clearance. However microglia are not the only cells in the CNS to internalise Aβ, and the uptake of these peptides by astrocytes and neurons also likely contributes to AD pathology. Astrocytes contribute to Aβ clearance and degradation, as well as providing trophic support to neurons and forming a protective barrier between Aβ deposits and neurons [224,225]. Astrocytes have been found to cluster around Aβ deposits and these deposits are thought to activate inflammatory signalling in astrocytes [212]. Likewise, in a mouse model of AD, astrocytes were found to degrade Aβ (1–42) peptides in vitro and in situ, thereby clearing the Aβ deposits in what is hypothesised to be a protective housekeeping function of these cells [224]. However, their tendency to release pro-inflammatory molecules is thought to stimulate and even accelerate the progression of AD. Astrocytes activated by Aβ produce chemokines, cytokines, and ROS that may result in neuronal damage [226,227]. Importantly, it has been found that neurons can also take up Aβ peptides and the internalisation of Aβ by neurons is considered to be one of the earliest signs of AD [228]. This finding is consistent with the results of previous studies which have shown that the Aβ obtained from phagocytosed neurons accumulates within astrocytes and that amyloid plaques form when these Aβ-burdened astrocytes die [229]. Chemokines released by astrocytes also attract microglia, thus further adding to the complexity of AD pathogenesis.

Finally, neurons themselves appear to contribute to the production of neuroinflammatory products in AD, although they were traditionally believed to be passive bystanders in neuroinflammation. Neurons produce several chemokines and cytokines including IL-1 [230,231], IL-6 [232] and TNFα [228]. Neuronal chemokines in particular act as messengers between neurons and glial cells [233,234]; the secretion of CD22 by neurons inhibits pro-inflammatory cytokine production in microglia [235]. In addition, neurons are able to serve as a source of

complement proteins [236–238], pentraxins, C-reactive protein, amyloid P [239], cyclooxygenase (COX)-2-derived prostanoids [220, 240–242] and inducible NOS [243]. Thus, the secretion of pro-inflammatory molecules by neurons could serve to enhance the inflammation in the brain due to the response of glial cells to the Aβ-containing plaques, thereby contributing to the pathogenesis of AD.

### 5.3.2. Parkinson's disease

PD is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder [244], with symptoms including resting tremor, slowed movement, postural instability and muscle rigidity, as well as non-motor symptoms [245,246]. It is an age-dependent disorder characterised by the progressive degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). In addition, inclusions called Lewy bodies (LBs), which are composed of α-synuclein and ubiquitinated proteins, are found within the remaining SN neurons [247]. There is debate about whether LBs directly cause neuronal death or perhaps sequester smaller neurotoxic protein aggregates to preserve neuronal viability [248–250]. The motor symptoms can be treated with DA therapeutics; however, the effectiveness of these agents diminishes as the severity of the clinical symptoms increases due to progression of the underlying neurodegeneration [251].

The recent identification of mutations in several genes linked to rare inherited forms of PD has led to speculation that these mutations promote inclusion formation, ubiquitin-proteosome system (UPS) dysfunction and nigral cell loss, although the precise molecular mechanisms are unclear and the pathology in humans and animal models bearing these mutations is highly variable [252,253]. Nevertheless, recent studies of transgenic animals with mutations linked to Parkinsonism, as well as neurotoxin- and virus-based animal models of PD, have provided valuable insight into potential pathogenic mechanisms involving neuroinflammation. Human clinical imaging, post-mortem examinations and epidemiological studies have recently highlighted the role of neuroinflammation in PD and raise the interesting possibility that chronic inflammation may lead to symptoms of PD [254]. There has recently been significant interest in developing novel anti-inflammatory agents that may help prevent or ameliorate CNS inflammation [255]. In this section, we will mention a few targets the modulation of which has yielded promising results which may be translatable to the clinic in the future.

The presence of activated microglial cells and elevated levels of several pro-inflammatory cytokines are evident in post-mortem examinations of the SN [256,257]. An emerging area of pre-clinical investigation involves development of strategies to inhibit the glial reaction and to target pro-inflammatory cytokines [258–260]. IL-1β levels have been reported to increase rapidly after administration of LPS into the SN in mice and neuroprotection can be achieved by administering an anti-IL-1β neutralising antibody [261,262]. In the case of TNFα, a rat model of PD found that inhibition of TNFα prevented DA neuronal cell death. The use of a recombinant dominant negative TNFα inhibitor, XENP345, reduced neurotoxin- and endotoxin-induced DA neuronal death by approximately 50% [263]. In short, it is clear that targeting specific inflammatory mediators has been a valuable approach to establish the extent to which the various factors implicated in PD pathogenesis contribute to loss of DA neurons in animal models. However, due to the complexity of the human disease and the interactions of inflammatory pathways, design of a successful intervention will very likely require a multi-target approach during the earliest stages of PD.

This complexity of PD pathogenesis is exemplified in the role of NF-κB activation. Although numerous studies from animal models support a role for the NF-κB pathway in preventing neuronal death induced by oxidative stress, excitotoxicity, ischemia, or glucose deprivation [264, 265], there is also evidence supporting a dual role of NF-κB in neurodegenerative diseases. Specifically, activation of NF-κB in neurons generally promotes their survival, whereas NF-κB mediates proliferation and activation of glial cells some of which may promote pathological inflammatory processes [264,266,267]. Nuclear translocation of the transactivating subunit, NF-κB RelA (p65), has been reported to be 70-fold greater in the SN of PD patients compared age-matched healthy controls [268]. A relationship between enhanced nuclear translocation of NF-κB and oxidative stress in DA neurons of PD patients is supported by in vivo studies in which 6-OHDA-induced oxidative stress in rat DA neurons was mediated by an NF-κB-dependent p53-signalling pathway [269]. Indeed, therapeutic agents for PD that are designed to inhibit NF-κB activation have been described [256]. The NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) peptides, which inhibit the activation of NF-κB signalling, have been shown to attenuate the glial response and MPTP-induced nigral degeneration [270]. Similarly, the synthetic triterpenoid CDDO-Me, a potent activator of the Nrf2 anti-oxidant pathway and an inhibitor of NF-κB, attenuates the production of TNFα and other glial-derived inflammatory mediators, thereby reducing the neurotoxicity of activated microglial cultures on DA neuron-like cells [271]. Further, the brain-permeable methyl amide derivative (CDDO-MA) was recently shown to afford neuroprotection in vivo against MPTP and 6-OHDA-induced nigral degeneration in mice and rats [272]. Thus, there is evidence from in vivo pharmacological studies showing that the inhibition of oxidant-mediated apoptogenic transduction pathways and NF-κB activation protects against DA neuronal loss, providing support for a link between oxidative stress and inflammation in PD pathogenesis [273].

Numerous therapeutic agents used to treat inflammation or for immunosuppression have been found to ameliorate markers of PD. The immunosuppressants, cyclosporine A and FK-506 (tacrolimus), the non-immunosuppressant FK-506 derivatives (immunophilin ligands including pentoxifylline), as well as the non-selective COX-2 inhibitor sodium salicylate, have all shown neuroprotective activity in either MPTP-induced nigral injury or the 6-OHDA rat model of PD [274–276]. Despite this, clinical trials of immunophilin ligands in PD patients have had limited success [277], possibly due to the advanced nature of the disease in the patient cohort. Similarly, the glucocorticoid dexamethasone was protective against both MPTP and intranigral LPS-induced cell death [278,279]. The semi-synthetic second generation tetracycline antibiotic derivative minocycline, which has anti-inflammatory properties and readily crosses the BBB, has been investigated in rodent and non-human primate models of PD with mixed outcomes. In some studies it was shown to be neuroprotective against MPTP-, LPS- and 6-OHDA-induced nigral DA neuron loss [280–283], while in others it exacerbated the effects of MPTP in rodents and non-human primates [284,285]. The reason for these discrepancies is unclear but it could be due to differences in dosing and timing of the intervention regimen. Nevertheless, because minocycline is well-tolerated in humans, it was tested in a randomised, double-blind, futility clinical trial in patients with early PD. The recommendation at the completion of Phase II was for advancement to Phase III clinical trials to determine if minocycline could alter long-term progression of PD [286]. The results of this study suggest that minocycline has a good safety profile and that it should be tested next in Phase III trials, although no such trial is on record. In part, this could be due to concerns over the worsening of symptoms observed with minocycline in the treatment of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [287]. Chemical modification of minocycline using structure–activity relationship analysis is being used to develop safer and more efficacious versions of the drug that can protect nigral DA neurons at low doses [288].

Other compounds with anti-inflammatory actions that have been shown to rescue nigral DA neurons from a variety of neurotoxic insults such as LPS and MPTP include vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) [289, 290], the polyphenolic flavanoid silymarin [291], the NMDA receptor antagonist dextromethorphan [292], and agonists of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ) [293]. Finally, the use of certain steroids such as allopregnenalone has been found to protect against DA neuron loss in rodent models [294,295], although these agents might be unsuitable for long-term use in humans.

Other agents that have non-immune primary targets have been found to ameliorate PD symptoms by immunomodulatory mechanisms.

The selective iNOS inhibitors S-methylisothiourea and L-N(G)-nitroarginine were shown to exert neuroprotective effects on DA neurons in rats against LPS [296–299], suggesting that free radical scavengers or iNOS inhibitors may have potential therapeutic effects in PD. Copolymer-1 (Cop-1) immunisation, which has been used effectively in patients with chronic neuroinflammatory disease such as relapsing remitting MS, has recently been shown to have neuroprotective effects in the nigrostriatal pathway against MPTP by several immunomodulatory mechanisms, including promotion of CD4⁺ T cell accumulation within the SN, suppression of microglial activation and increased local expression of the potent DA neuron survival factor GDNF [300,301]. Interestingly, immunomodulatory effects have also been described *in vitro* and in animal models treated with the monoamine oxidase B (MAO) inhibitor drugs pargyline and selegiline (Deprenyl) [302,303]. In summary, there have been numerous attempts made to repurpose or develop new immunomodulatory drugs and therapeutic immunisation to treat neurological diseases and control neuroinflammatory responses has emerged [304]; but it is clear that important considerations must be acknowledged before moving ahead with such approaches in order to avoid untoward side-effects to both the immune system and the brain.

### 6. Conclusion

It is almost 60 years since the first cytokine was described [305,306]. Since that time, more than 300 cytokines, chemokines, and growth factors have been described, with varying functions on not just the immune system but on every organ system in the body. However in spite of this we are still largely in our infancy in understanding how these factors, alone and in concert with other factors, influence homeostatic and inflammatory events. Continued research is therefore clearly essential in order to better understand the complexity of these pathways and the pleiotropic interactions that characterise cytokine signaling. Through so doing hopefully we will eventually be able to eliminate inflammatory disease processes without compromising the individual or exposing them to other deleterious outcomes.
