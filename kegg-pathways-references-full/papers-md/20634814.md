# Molecular mechanisms of biogenesis and exocytosis of cytotoxic granules

**Geneviève de Saint Basile**\*,†,§, **Gaël Ménasché**\*\*, and **Alain Fischer**\*,‡||

Abstract | Cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells are crucial for immune surveillance against virus-infected cells and tumour cells. Molecular studies of individuals with inherited defects that impair lymphocyte cytotoxic function have also highlighted the importance of cytotoxicity in the regulation and termination of immune responses. As discussed in this Review, characterization of these defects has contributed to our understanding of the key steps that are required for the maturation of cytotoxic granules and the secretion of their contents at the immunological synapse during target cell killing. This has revealed a marked similarity between cytotoxic granule exocytosis at the immunological synapse and synaptic vesicle exocytosis at the neurological synapse. We explore the possibility that comparison of these two kinetically and spatially regulated secretory pathways will provide clues to uncover additional effectors that regulate the cytotoxic function of lymphocytes.

The capacity of the host to fight intracellular pathogens or tumours requires a combined response by the innate and adaptive immune systems, which recognize, respond and eliminate the offending cells. In particular, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells identify and kill virus-infected or transformed cells. To activate CTLs, professional antigen-presenting cells (APCs) present, in a complex with MHC class I molecules, newly synthesized antigenic peptides or cross-present peptide antigens processed from endocytosed proteins derived from tumour cells or virus-infected cells (reviewed in REF. 1). NK cell cytotoxic activity is triggered by ligation of specific activating receptors and is inhibited by recognition of self MHC class I molecules. Thus recognition of self MHC class I molecules prevents killing of resting cells, whereas infected or tumour cells that have downregulated MHC class I expression, or stressed cells that upregulate expression of activating ligands, trigger NK cell activity (reviewed in REF. 2).

CTLs and NK cells use both a perforin-dependent and a death receptor-dependent pathway to exert their cytotoxic function. These pathways have key functions in both immune surveillance and immune regulation. However, they are not functionally redundant. The death receptor pathway kills repeatedly stimulated T cells by ligation of FAS (also known as CD95), TNFRs (tumour necrosis factor receptors) or TRAILRs (TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand receptors) with their cognate ligands (FASL, TNF and TRAIL, respectively)\*. The FAS–FASL interaction participates to the control of T and B cell responses triggered by prolonged antigen stimulation. Ligand-induced oligomerization of death receptors leads to the formation of the death-inducing signalling complex that initiates caspase-dependent apoptosis. The perforin-dependent pathway involves the polarized secretion of cytotoxic granules that contain perforin and granzymes. Perforin is crucial for enabling access of granzymes into the target cell, which are involved in triggering caspase-dependent and caspase-independent cell death.

Inherited deficiencies of both cytotoxic pathways have been described in humans and mice. Defects in either pathway are associated with dysregulation of lymphocyte homeostasis. Humans with inherited FAS or FASL deficiencies, as well as naturally occurring mouse mutants that lack FAS (*lpr* and *lpr<sup>c</sup>* mice) or FASL (*gld* mice), develop a lymphoproliferative syndrome, with an accumulation of non-malignant T and B cells, and autoimmunity\*. The disease occurs owing to impaired antigen-induced cell death of repeatedly stimulated self-reactive T and B cells. This pathway will not be further discussed in this Review. By contrast, the phenotypic consequences of the genetic defects that affect effectors of the granule-dependent pathway provide evidence of an important role for this pathway in the regulation and/or termination of immune responses. In humans, defects in T and NK cell cytotoxic function through the granule-dependent pathway result in a severe and often fatal immunopathological condition known as haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)\*,\* (TABLE 1).

syndrome is generally triggered by an infection, notably by a human herpes family virus. Accordingly, naturally occurring or engineered mice that have similar cytotoxicity defects, when infected with some strains of lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV), develop a disease that closely resembles HLH in humans. Of note, alternative pathways regulating lymphocyte homeostasis, such as the programmed cell death 1 (PD1)–PDL1 pathway, cannot counterbalance the consequences of CTL function deficiency. It is yet unknown whether PD1 function is preserved in patients with HLH.

HLH is associated with an overactive adaptive immune system, probably resulting from the failure of activated CTLs and NK cells to clear APCs and therefore to terminate an immune response. Uncontrolled expansion and activation of polyclonal CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in HLH leads to the activation of macrophages, which infiltrate several organs and release damaging pro-inflammatory cytokines (FIG. 1). The importance of perforin-dependent cytotoxic activity in immune surveillance against cancer has been shown in perforin-deficient mice<sup>7</sup>. This could also be the case in humans as a recent study shows that patients with hypomorphic mutations of the gene encoding perforin have a higher frequency of lymphomas than controls<sup>8</sup>.

In this Review, we discuss the studies of genetic disorders associated with HLH and of equivalent mouse mutants that have provided insight into the biogenesis of cytotoxic granules and their exocytosis for target cell killing. We describe the various molecules that have been shown to mediate discrete steps of the highly regulated process of cytotoxic granule exocytosis. Finally, we highlight the striking similarity between the machinery that regulates the secretion of cytotoxic effectors at the immunological synapse and of neurotransmitters at the neurological synapse.

### Granulysins
A family of serine proteases that are mainly found in the cytoplasmic granules of cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells. They enter target cells, possibly through perforin pores, and then some of them cleave and activate intracellular caspases and lead to target cell apoptosis.

### Immunological synapse
A region that can form between two cells of the immune system in close contact. The immunological synapse originally referred to the interaction between a T cell and an antigen-presenting cell. It involves adhesion molecules, as well as antigen receptors and cytokine receptors.

### Neurological synapse
A specialized junction through which neurons communicate with each other and with other cell types (for example, muscle cells) through the exchange of chemical messengers. According to the structural definition, the neurological synapse consists of a single presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic density, together with the specialized membranes and cleft in between.

### The granule-dependent secretory pathway
CTLs and NK cells have a similar mechanism for target cell killing, which occurs through polarized release of the contents of cytotoxic granules towards the target cell. In contrast to NK cells, which have constitutively ‘primed’ cytotoxic activity, naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells require 5–8 days after antigen recognition in secondary lymphoid tissues to differentiate into CTLs, proliferate and migrate to affected tissues. During this differentiation

Biogenesis of cytotoxic granules. Lytic granules are hybrid organelles that are specialized for the secretion of the cytotoxic effector molecules. They have been termed secretory lysosomes or lysosome-related organelles as, in addition to storing cytotoxic proteins before their secretion, they function as conventional lysosomes (that is, they degrade proteins and other molecules)<sup>15–17</sup>. In contrast to other cell types, which contain both secretory lysosomes and conventional lysosomes such as

a | In a normal individual, in response to an infectious trigger, antigen-specific CD8⁺ T cells transiently undergo massive clonal expansion, carry out cell-mediated cytolysis and produce interferon-γ (IFNγ) to eliminate infected cells. Following pathogen clearance, this immune response is self-limiting and most cells die, leaving a small number of memory CD8⁺ T cells.
b | Patients with impaired granule-dependent cytotoxic activity develop haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH). During the course of HLH, uncontrolled and increased expansion of antigen-specific effector T cells occurs, sustained by the failure of CD8⁺ T cells to deplete antigen-presenting cells and infected cells. Activated lymphocytes secrete high levels of IFNγ that further activates macrophages, which in turn activate more T cells. High levels of inflammatory cytokines are secreted, including IFNγ, tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-18, leading to an uncontrolled systemic inflammatory response. Activated macrophages phagocytose bystander haematopoietic cells (a process known as haemophagocytosis). Activated lymphocytes and macrophages infiltrate various organs resulting in massive tissue necrosis and organ failure.

Organelles that contain melanin, a common light-absorbing pigment.

Endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT). The multiprotein ESCRT machinery (ESCRT-I, ESCRT-II and ESCRT-III) promotes inward vesiculation at the limiting membrane of the sorting endosome and selects cargo proteins for delivery to the intraluminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies.

Golgi that are sorted to late endosomes and then to lysosomes for degradation. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) participates in the sorting of ubiquitylated protein cargo along this pathway²⁰. The ESCRT machinery together with HRS (hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate) recognizes ubiquitylated proteins on the surface of early endosomes that subsequently undergo invagination to form multivesicular bodies²¹,²². In CTLs, the role of the ESCRT sorting pathway in the biogenesis of cytotoxic granules and in the sorting of specific cytotoxic effectors is not yet known but consequences of molecular defects affecting this pathway suggest that it is likely to be involved in cytotoxic granule biogenesis (see below).

The relative proportions of dense core and multivesicular cortex vary substantially among cytotoxic granules¹⁶,²³. This is probably due to maturation stages of the cytotoxic granules, but it is not clear which organelles correspond to mature secretory cytotoxic granules. Granules with a prominent dense core may be the most mature or, alternatively, be an intermediate step towards maturation by fusion with multivesicular structures. In addition, it remains possible that a cytotoxic granule with a high proportion of dense core is actively carrying out degradation, thus acting as conventional lysosomes (FIG. 3a).

Newly synthesized perforin and the serine protease granzymes are the main effectors of the cytotoxic activity. Three granzyme subfamilies with various substrate specificities are expressed by human and rodent CTLs and/or NK cells²⁴. Although it is clear that granzyme B and probably granzyme A²⁵ have important roles in inducing target cell apoptosis, the function of the other granzymes in this process is less certain²⁶. Granzymes A and B reach the dense core of cytotoxic granules from the trans-Golgi network by specific sorting pathways. During their biosynthesis, granzymes are modified by the addition of a mannose-6-phosphate moiety, allowing their transport to the endosomes through the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR)²⁷. In late endosomes, M6PR dissociates from the bound ligands because of the acidic pH in the lumen and returns to the trans-Golgi network. Of note, M6PR is detectable in the vesicular domain of cytotoxic granules, whereas it is not detectable in typical lysosomes, suggesting that cytotoxic granules are at a ‘pre-lysosomal’ stage¹⁶. The pathway used by perforin to enter the cytotoxic granules is uncharacterized. The acidic pH of cytotoxic granules prevents Ca²⁺ binding to and polymerization of perforin, ensuring that stored perforin remains inactive, therefore preventing damage to CTLs before release of perforin and granzymes at the immunological synapse²⁸. M6PR also sorts soluble lysosomal proteins such as acid hydrolases into the multivesicular domain of the cytotoxic granules. Other resident membrane proteins, such as lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), the functions of which are largely unknown, are sorted through a tyrosine-based or dileucine-based motif that directly interacts with multimeric cytoplasmic adaptor protein (AP) complexes²⁹. It is intriguing to note that few studies have investigated the links between morphology, protein

Figure 2 | Sequence of events during cytotoxic T lymphocyte killing of a cognate target cell. Following antigen-dependent recognition of a target cell, cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) form a transient conjugate with the target cell. The CTL rapidly reorients its microtubule-organizing centre (MTOC) and the entire microtubule network towards the contact site, where an immunological synapse is being organized. The cytotoxic synapse is organized into a central supramolecular activation complex (cSMAC), where signalling molecules and T cell receptors (TCRs) are localized, surrounded by a peripheral integrin-rich ring, the peripheral SMAC (pSMAC), which defines the boundary of the synapse. Within minutes of stimulation, cytotoxic granules move along microtubules in a minus-end direction and then cluster around the MTOC. The granules are then delivered to the plasma membrane at the synapse by the MTOC directly contacting the plasma membrane. Cytotoxic granule content is released into a small secretory cleft (yellow) formed between the CTL and target cell. The release of perforin induces the entry of granzymes into the target cell. Rapid death of the target cell by apoptosis ensues. Only some cytotoxic granules are secreted, enabling CTLs to carry out repeated cycles of antigen recognition, polarization and cytolysis.

trafficking, maturation stages and dual function of cytotoxic granules. Nevertheless, studies of genetic defects in cytotoxic granule biogenesis and functions have provided some clues.

**Genetic defects impairing cytotoxic granule biogenesis.** Chediak–Higashi syndrome (CHS) and Hermansky–Pudlak syndrome type 2 (HPS2) are human genetic conditions that show autosomal recessive inheritance and defective cytotoxic activity of CTLs and NK cells owing to impaired formation of cytotoxic granules^{23,30–33}. The natural mouse mutants *beige* and *pearl* mice develop equivalent features to those occurring in CHS and HPS2, respectively^{34}. Both CHS and HPS2 are also associated with hypopigmentation, resulting from aberrant formation of melanosomes (TABLE 1). Patients with CHS and *beige* mice have biallelic mutations of the gene encoding the cytoplasmic protein lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST)^{33,35,36} and have granulated cells with giant intracytoplasmic lysosomal structures. Most of our understanding of the function of LYST has come from studies of other members of the same family of vesicle trafficking regulatory proteins^{37} that contain a BEACH (*beige* and Chediak–Higashi) domain. This family includes neurobeachin, a neuron-specific protein that is required for synaptic transmission^{38}. Interestingly, two binding partners of LYST — HRS and LYST-interacting protein 5 (LIP5) — are ESCRT-associated proteins, suggesting that LYST participates in the sorting of endosomal proteins into lysosomes^{20,39,40}. A role for LYST in sorting of lysosomal proteins to late endosomes has also been suggested by analysis of LYST-deficient B cell lines^{41}. Alternatively, LYST could be involved in regulating fusion or fission of lysosomes, as HRS can also

The resultant SNARE pair has a role in the fusion of the bilayer. Assembly of the proper SNARE pair is also involved in establishing the specificity of fusion.

Figure 3 | A model depicting the biogenesis and exocytosis of cytotoxic granules. a | Granzymes and other soluble proteins, including lysosomal hydrolases, are sorted from the trans-Golgi network by the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) and transported to early endosomes before they are sorted to late endosomes. M6PR is then recycled to the trans-Golgi network. Lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1) or LAMP2 travel directly to the plasma membrane where they are internalized and sorted by adaptor protein complexes (not shown) to the endosomal pathway. The recruitment of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery and the formation of luminal vesicles occur in early endosomes and also in late endosomes. Cytotoxic granules are hybrid organelles that contain both lysosome and late endosome components. They have various proportions of dense core domains, where perforin and granzymes are stored, and multivesicular bodies, which contain acid hydrolases. b | Following antigen recognition and proximal signalling events, cytotoxic granules are polarized towards the cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL)-target cell contact site where the immunological synapse forms. Actin filaments are cleared away from the site of secretion (not shown). Mature cytotoxic granules dock at the plasma membrane through the interaction of RAB27a with synaptotagmin-like protein 1 (SLP1) or SLP2. In addition, cytotoxic granules interact with a docking complex of MUNC18-2 and syntaxin 11 in the closed conformation. Docked vesicles are then primed by MUNC13-4, which probably triggers the switch of syntaxin 11 from a closed to an open conformation. A SNARE (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor accessory protein receptor) complex then forms between a vesicle membrane SNARE, possibly vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7) and/or VAMP8, on one side and the target membrane SNAREs syntaxin 11 and SNAP23 (synaptosomal-associated protein of 23 kDa), on the other side. Completion of the fusion reaction occurs when MUNC18-2 clasps across the zippering four-helix SNARE complex bundle. Formation of the SNARE complex precedes membrane fusion. Numbers indicate the different steps that are impaired owing to loss of function of the proteins causing inherited haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis: defects in lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) (1), adaptor protein 3 (AP3) (2), perforin (3), RAB27a (4), syntaxin 11 (5), MUNC18-2 (6) and MUNC13-4 (7).
HLH has been reported in one case only<sup>45</sup>, in contrast to all other genetic disorders associated with defective cytotoxic activity (TABLE 1). This might indicate that mediators of HLH pathophysiology could be missorted in AP3-deficient cells.

So, LYST and AP3 promote the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes; by contrast, other proteins are negative regulators of cytotoxic function. An engineered absence of the oestrogen receptor-binding fragment-associated antigen 9 (EBAG9) enhances the cytotoxic activity of CTLs<sup>47</sup>. EBAG9 is thought to control the endosomal–lysosomal trafficking of cytotoxic effectors, as loss of EBAG9 enhances the sorting of granzyme B and acid hydrolases to granules, whereas it impairs the sorting of LAMP1 to the cytotoxic granules. EBAG9-deficient cells also have smaller cytotoxic granules. It is intriguing to note that the phenotypes of increased cytotoxic component trafficking, increased cytotoxic function and reduced granule size associated with loss of function of EBAG9 are opposite to the phenotypes associated with a functional loss of LYST and AP3. This suggests opposing functions of EBAG9 versus LYST and AP3 in the regulation of endosomal protein sorting during cytotoxic granule biogenesis. It would therefore be interesting to investigate whether transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation of expression of EBAG9, LYST and AP3 is used to modulate the level of killing. These data support the hypothesis that the CTL cytotoxic response is controlled by the integration of positive and negative regulators at different checkpoints. In addition, JAKMIP1 (Janus kinase and microtubule-interacting protein 1) has been described as a negative regulator of the transport of cytotoxic granules along microtubules<sup>48</sup>.

### Genetic defects in cytotoxic granule contents

Perforin is essential for granule-mediated cytotoxicity, as indicated in studies of gene-targeted perforin-deficient mice and in humans who carry inherited mutations of the gene encoding perforin (*PRF1*), which leads to type 2 familial haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (FHL2), the prototypical HLH<sup>6,49</sup> (TABLE 1). Mutational analysis of *PRF1* and a better understanding of the structures of the membrane attack complex-like proteins (MACPF) have recently provided new insights into the mechanism of action of perforin<sup>14,50,51</sup>. Most of the perforin mutations occurring in patients with FHL2 affect perforin protein folding or trafficking to secretory granules. Further studies of the few mutations that disturb either Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding or oligomerization of perforin at the target cell membrane allowed these functions to be attributed to a specific region of the protein. Following the release of perforin from cytotoxic granules, binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the C2 domain of perforin allows its interaction with the target cell membrane, a key step in cytotoxic activity<sup>52</sup>. Next, the MACPF domain of perforin mediates oligomerization and conformational change, a step that is crucial for pore formation and cytotoxic activity. This domain was recently shown to have high homology with bacterial cholesterol-dependent cytolysins<sup>50</sup>.

Perforin is required for the delivery of granzymes into the cytoplasm of the target cell, although the precise site of perforin action in the target cell and the precise mechanisms underlying cell death are still controversial<sup>14,53</sup>. Granzyme B induces caspase-dependent apoptosis<sup>54</sup>, whereas granzyme A can function in a caspase-independent manner<sup>55</sup>. Of note, an additional role for granzyme A in inflammatory signalling has been described recently<sup>56</sup>. Of interest, HLH has never been reported to occur in association with inherited granzyme deficiencies. Given that several cell death pathways are activated by individual granzymes, the absence of a single granzyme protein does not severely inhibit target cell death. For example, DNA fragmentation of cells targeted by granzyme B-deficient CTLs is markedly delayed<sup>57</sup>, but granzyme A-deficient CTLs have no clear cytotoxic defect<sup>58</sup>. Mice that are deficient in both granzyme A and granzyme B are vulnerable to the poxvirus ectromelia<sup>59,60</sup>. However, it is difficult to extrapolate from mouse models the pathophysiological functions of these proteases in humans, given the substantial interspecies differences in the cytotoxic potential of the respective granzymes<sup>24</sup>. The study of mice deficient for serglycin, the main proteoglycan species found in cytotoxic granules in mice and human CTLs, has shown a role for this core protein in the storage of granzyme B and the formation of electron dense cytotoxic granules. However, serglycin is not essential for storage of granzyme A and perforin, and is not required for the cytotoxic activity of CTLs<sup>61</sup>.

It therefore seems that the only non-redundant protein contained in cytotoxic granules is perforin. This suggests that a deficiency in killing effector molecules might be compensated by the others.

#### Cytotoxic granule transport and delivery

**Initial cell activation and polarization of granules.** The delivery of cytotoxic granules to the immunological synapse is highly dependent on the microtubule cytoskeleton. Cytotoxic granules move along microtubules in a dynein-dependent manner towards the MTOC, which polarizes to the CTL–target cell interface. Following contact between the MTOC and cSMAC, cytotoxic granules are delivered directly to the secretory domain, which lacks an underlying cytoskeletal network<sup>62</sup>. However, recent studies suggest that the strength of TCR signalling can uncouple the movements of the MTOC and the granules and therefore influence how granules are delivered to the immunological synapse<sup>63,64</sup>. A weak TCR stimulus seems sufficient to induce microtubule polarization to the cSMAC but not rapid cytotoxic granule clustering to the centrosome. As a consequence, cytotoxic granules are first delivered to the integrin-rich pSMAC, where microtubules have anchored, and then they move towards the secretory domain of the cSMAC to be secreted<sup>63</sup>. Along this route, the membrane-anchored microtubule tips could provide a scaffold for molecules involved in the docking and fusion process of cytotoxic granules.

Signalling proteins activated by TCR engagement are required for both MTOC polarization and granule movement, leading to phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) activation, diacylglycerol production and ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) phosphorylation<sup>65–67</sup>, as well as other downstream events. Inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate production by PLCγ initiates mobilization of intracellular

Figure 4 | An additional maturation step of cytotoxic granules before exocytosis. In addition to its role as a priming factor, MUNC13-4 mediates the association of recycling endosomes (through RAB11) with late endosomes (through RAB7) to form exocytic vesicles that are specialized for the regulated secretory pathway. These vesicles carry effector proteins of the exocytic machinery, such as MUNC13-4, RAB27a and synaptotagmin-like protein 2 (SLP2). Following T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, exocytic vesicles coalesce with perforin-containing granules and are tethered through the C2 domain of an SLP family member (SLP1 or SLP2) to the plasma membrane.

Ca²⁺ to the cytoplasm and Ca²⁺ influx. Interestingly, MTOC polarization seems to be mediated by diacylglycerol in a Ca²⁺-independent manner, whereas granule polarization is mediated by Ca²⁺-mediated signalling, further supporting the dichotomy of both polarizing movements⁶⁸.

MTOC polarization also requires proteins such as CDC42 (cell-division cycle 42)⁶⁹ and its effectors IQGAP1 (IQ motif-containing GTPase-activating protein 1)⁶²,⁷⁰ and CIP4 (CDC42-interacting protein 4), as well as the function of the formins formin-like 1 and diaphanous 1, which link microtubules and the peripheral actin networks at the cytotoxic synapse⁷¹,⁷².

Granule docking. Following MTOC and granule polarization at the synapse, there are several additional steps required before cytotoxic granule exocytosis. The molecular characterization of inherited forms of HLH has led to the identification of crucial effectors of this process. Griscelli syndrome type 2 (GS2) and the equivalent mouse syndrome, the *ashen* mouse, are characterized by hypopigmentation (owing to defective release of melanosome contents from melanocyte dendrites⁷³) and defective CTL and NK cell cytotoxic activity⁷⁴,⁷⁵ (TABLE 1). Biallelic mutations in the gene encoding RAB27a are responsible for GS2 (REF. 74) and the *ashen* phenotype⁷⁵. The Rab family of small GTPases are important regulators of vesicle trafficking and compartmentalization⁷⁶. Accordingly, RAB27a-deficient NK cells and CTLs show impaired exocytosis of cytotoxic granules, although granule polarization is intact⁷⁴,⁷⁷. Electron microscopy studies have revealed that in RAB27a-deficient cells polarized cytotoxic granules fail to dock at the plasma membrane in response to TCR stimulation⁷⁷,⁷⁸. The synaptotagmin-like proteins SLP1 and SLP2 have been recently identified as targets of active RAB27a in CTLs⁷⁹,⁸⁰. These proteins contain two C2 domains in the terminal part of the protein that can associate with plasma membrane phospholipids, suggesting that they might be involved in tethering RAB27a to the membrane (FIG. 4). In melanocytes, RAB27a associates with melanophilin, a synaptotagmin-like protein that is specifically expressed by melanocytes, but which lacks C2 domains⁸¹. Melanophilin also interacts with the molecular motor protein myosin Va, thereby forming a complex of melanophilin, RAB27a and myosin Va that bridges the melanosomes at the plus-end of microtubules to the cortical actin network and enables their distribution to the dendrite tips of melanocytes, where they are transferred to adjacent keratinocytes. The fact that no effector of RAB27a involved in the transport complex of cytotoxic granules on actin filaments has been identified in CTLs⁷⁹ supports the hypothesis that cytotoxic granules are delivered directly with the polarized MTOC to the actin-cleared cSMAC.

Granule priming. Once cytotoxic granules have tethered to the plasma membrane, a priming step is required to enable fusion of the cytotoxic granule membrane with the plasma membrane. This process probably regulates the number of cytotoxic granules that are released at the immunological synapse. MUNC13-4 is thought to mediate this step. The absence of MUNC13-4 is the cause of FHL3, which is another inherited form of HLH with a phenotype that is indistinguishable from that of perforin deficiency⁸³, and it is also responsible for the phenotype of *jinx* mice⁸⁴ (TABLE 1). As in RAB27a-deficient lymphocytes, exocytosis of cytotoxic granules from MUNC13-4-deficient T cells and NK cells is impaired, whereas other secretory pathways, including the polarized secretion of interferon-γ (IFNγ), are preserved. In the absence of MUNC13-4, cytotoxic granules dock at the site of secretion⁸³ but cannot fuse with the plasma membrane. By analogy with the function of MUNC13-1 at the neuronal synapse (see below), MUNC13-4 is thought to mediate priming of cytotoxic granule fusion with the plasma membrane at the immunological synapse, probably by regulating the interaction between the vesicle membrane SNARE (v-SNARE) and the target membrane SNARE (t-SNARE) required for the fusion of granule and plasma membranes.
However, an additional role for MUNC13-4 at an earlier step involving formation of a pool of endosomal vesicles was recently described<sup>85</sup>. This pool of vesicles carries effectors of the exocytic machinery and, following target cell recognition, they polarize and coalesce with perforin-containing granules that have simultaneously, but independently, polarized towards the immunological synapse<sup>85,86</sup> (FIG. 4). RAB27a is also associated with the exocytic vesicles and interacts with MUNC13-4 in cytotoxic cells<sup>85</sup> (FIG. 4). The role of the molecular interaction between RAB27a and MUNC13-4 is not known. It might be involved at a final step of the exocytic process to coordinate the docking and the priming of granule exocytosis.

The requirement for these multiple cytotoxic granule maturation steps might have several functions, including the prevention of an inappropriate release of granule contents and thus deleterious bystander consequences. It might also allow cytotoxic granules to function as conventional lysosomes to eliminate unused cytotoxic proteins. In addition, limiting the number of cytotoxic granules that are ready to release their contents endows cytotoxic cells with the ability to repeatedly mediate cytotoxic activity. The actual numbers of cytotoxic granules that are released per target cell interaction has not yet been estimated and might vary according to the strength of cell stimulation.

### Granule fusion

Membrane fusion is mediated by evolutionary conserved functions of the SNARE proteins<sup>87,88</sup>. The selective pairing of t-SNARE, v-SNARE and a SNAP protein from opposing membranes forms a stable four-helix bundle that regulates membrane fusion during intracellular vesicle trafficking<sup>89</sup>. Loss of syntaxin 11, a member of the SNARE family that is phylogenetically related to the t-SNAREs syntaxin 1, syntaxin 2, syntaxin 3 and syntaxin 4, is the cause of FHL4, an inherited form of HLH<sup>90</sup> (TABLE 1). Deficiency in syntaxin 11 partially impairs granule exocytosis by NK cells and CTLs without impairing granule polarization, which suggests that syntaxin 11 has an important function downstream of the recruitment of cytotoxic granules to the immunological synapse. This defect can be partially restored by IL-2 stimulation<sup>91</sup>, which suggests that cytokine activation can induce synthesis of proteins that complement the syntaxin 11 defect, increase granule biogenesis and therefore granule docking probability, or allow the use of an alternative secretory mechanism (only detectable following strong cell activation) that partially bypasses the requirement for syntaxin 11.

SNARE interactions are regulated by accessory proteins, such as the SEC1/MUNC18 family of proteins<sup>92,93</sup>, required for inducing SNARE-mediated membrane fusion. SNARE and SEC1/MUNC18 proteins interact to mediate complementary roles in membrane fusion. Recessive mutations of the STXBP2 gene encoding MUNC18-2 were recently shown to account for a newly discovered genetic form of HLH, designated FHL5 (REFS 94,95) (TABLE 1). MUNC18-2 was previously reported to interact with the t-SNARE syntaxin 3 (REF. 96). Although MUNC18-2-deficient CTLs have normal levels of syntaxin 3 expression, the expression of syntaxin 11, which also interacts with MUNC18-2, is markedly reduced. Thus, syntaxin 11 is the main partner of MUNC18-2 in CTLs and NK cells, which is consistent with the same exocytic defect observed in both FHL5 (MUNC18-2 deficiency) and FHL4 (syntaxin 11 deficiency). MUNC18-2 is the homologue of the neuronal protein MUNC18-1, the deletion of which leads to a complete loss of neurotransmitter secretion at the neurological synapse<sup>97–99</sup>. The MUNC18-2–syntaxin 11 complex at the immunological synapse probably regulates granule docking and initiation of SNARE complex formation upstream of the priming step (FIG. 3b). As MUNC18-2 and other effectors, such as MUNC13-4, are expressed in other cell types and shown to be involved in the trafficking of key products in these cells, consequences of their deficiencies might potentially affect other cell functions.

A systematic comparison of the proteins and mechanisms involved in vesicle secretion at the immunological synapse and neurological synapse could be instrumental in the identification of additional molecules required for granule secretion (discussed below). Given that the molecular defects in a subset of patients with inherited HLH conditions have not yet been identified indicates that other molecules are involved in this process.

#### Secretion of granules

Following the fusion of granules with the plasma membrane at the immunological synapse, further steps are required for efficient release of granule content. The acid sphingomyelinase (ASMase) was recently reported to have a role at this late step of granule exocytosis<sup>100</sup>. ASMase-deficient mice, the model of Niemann–Pick disease, show delayed clearance of LCMV infection associated with a slight reduction in granule-dependent cytotoxicity. In addition, cytotoxic granules showed less shrinkage following fusion with the plasma membrane<sup>100</sup>. Given the role of ASMase in the metabolism of sphingolipids, it was suggested that ASMase deficiency may impair membrane lipid movement and subsequent contraction of the granules.

Recent high-resolution imaging studies of NK cell cytotoxic synapses have shown that, in the central active zone of the synapse, cytotoxic granule exocytosis is coordinated with the retrieval of LAMP1-associated membranes into the cells<sup>101</sup>. This bidirectional traffic of vesicles could facilitate recycling and reuse of membranes by cytotoxic cells. It may also allow molecular exchanges between outgoing and incoming vesicles, a mechanism that functions at the neurological synapse<sup>102</sup>.

#### Immunological and neurological synapses

The structure of the immunological synapse is similar to that of the neurological synapse that forms between neurons (or between neurons and other cell types such as muscle cells). In both settings, the pre- and postsynaptic cells interact through a synaptic cleft and use secreted effectors. Heterophilic and homophilic interactions of adhesion molecules mediate cell–cell contacts. In both synapses, the delivery of effectors is tightly

regulated in a spatial and temporal manner. A main difference between the two types of synapse is that neurological synapses are permanent and fixed structures, whereas immunological synapses are transient and can occur at any site of the cell membrane; this accounts for the different kinetics of secretion (milliseconds versus minutes, respectively).

**Trafficking in the active zone.** The mechanisms that regulate vesicle exocytosis at the neurological synapse have been extensively analysed. It is notable that several of the effectors that mediate the exocytic machinery at both synapses belong to the same families of proteins [TABLE 2]. A comparison of these two highly organized and regulated systems of communication is therefore mutually informative. At the neurological synapse, a presynaptic active zone has similarities to the cSMAC of the immunological synapse (FIG. 5). The protein network that constitutes the cytomatrix at the active zone (CAZ) is involved in the organization of docking, priming and exocytosis of synaptic vesicles. Synaptic vesicles are tethered or docked at the neurological synapse through a series of molecular interactions. Members of the Rab family of proteins such as RAB3 on the vesicle, equivalent to RAB27a in CTL cytotoxic granules, are involved. RAB3 interacts with RAB3-interacting molecule (RIM) at the plasma membrane, similar to SLP1 or SLP2 at the immunological synapse. RIM can also interact with MUNC13-1, allowing the formation of a RAB3–RIM–MUNC13-1 complex that brings synaptic vesicles in close proximity to the priming machinery. Vesicles dock by interacting with a complex on the plasma membrane formed between MUNC18-1 and syntaxin 1 in its closed (inactive) conformation, which then binds SNAP25 at the plasma membrane. Then, synaptotagmin 1 (a Ca²⁺ sensor on the synaptic vesicle) associates with the docking complex, localizing vesicles close to Ca²⁺ channels required for triggering the last step of exocytosis (see below). The v-SNARE synaptobrevin 2 binds to the synaptotagmin 1–syntaxin 1–MUNC18-1–SNAP25 complex at the plasma membrane and the four-helix SNARE bundle forms between syntaxin 1, synaptobrevin 2 and the two helices of SNAP25. MUNC13-1 primes vesicles for fusion by inducing a conformational change in syntaxin 1 to generate the open conformation thereby promoting the formation of a loose SNARE complex, a first step of interaction towards zipping of the SNARE complex. Then, MUNC18-1 clasps the SNARE complex and stimulates the fusion process. The fusion process is controlled by proteins such as complexin, which associates with the partially zippered trans-SNARE complex and holds the complex in an ‘off state’. The action of complexin is reversed by the influx of Ca²⁺, which binds synaptotagmin and allows the fusion process to be completed. Such regulatory proteins thereby keep the fusion machinery poised in a ‘stand-by state’, enabling the release of neurotransmitters to be precisely timed and regulated at the neurological synapse.

What can the neurological synapse tell us about the immunological synapse? Many effectors of the machinery for docking, priming and fusion at the immunological synapse have also been characterized. Their roles at the immunological synapse are consistent with the roles of their homologues at the neurological synapse. At the immunological synapse, priming function of MUNC13-4 might trigger the switch of syntaxin 11 from a closed to an open conformation, although this has not yet been shown at the molecular level. Although a specific v-SNARE has not been identified on cytotoxic granules, vesicle-associated membrane protein 7 (VAMP7) and VAMP8 are good candidates, as they were reported to associate with cytotoxic granules, and their loss reduces granule-dependent target cell killing. So, a SNARE complex can form between the cytotoxic granule membrane SNARE, possibly VAMP7 and/or VAMP8, and the t-SNARE syntaxin 11 and SNAP23 on the plasma membrane. SNAP23 is a ubiquitously expressed member of the SNAP family that interacts with syntaxin 11 in lymphocytes and, therefore, might participate in the SNARE complex that forms at the immunological synapse. Completion of the fusion reaction probably occurs when MUNC18-2 clasps across the zipping four-helix SNARE complex bundle. It remains to be determined whether, as found at the neurological synapse, other proteins provide an additional layer of regulation during the fusion process and/or the cytotoxic phase. Synaptotagmin 7 has been proposed as a candidate Ca²⁺ sensor of cytotoxic granule exocytosis in CTLs. CTLs from synaptotagmin 7-deficient mice show decreased antigen-stimulated target cell killing, but they show normal cell killing when stimulated by solid-phase CD3-specific antibodies. In contrast to synaptotagmin 1 at the neurological synapse, synaptotagmin 7 has low

affinity for Ca²⁺, making its involvement in cytotoxic granule exocytosis unclear. Indeed, whether Ca²⁺ influx and a Ca²⁺ sensor are required for the membrane fusion step in granule exocytosis remains to be shown. The Ca²⁺ channel ORAI1 (also known as CRACM1) and the Ca²⁺ sensor STIM1 (stromal interaction molecule 1) were shown to accumulate at the immunological synapse of CTLs [113,114]. ORAI1 is likely to be involved in mediating Ca²⁺ influx for granule and MTOC polarization before granule exocytosis. It remains difficult to assess whether an additional Ca²⁺ influx is required, as it is at the neurological synapse, for the granule fusion step and membrane pore opening. The sustained increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration after the initial rise that follows antigen stimulation might be required at any step of granule secretion; an issue that remains difficult to test experimentally.

Scaffolding proteins such as CAST (CAZ-associated structural protein), Piccolo and Bassoon form an interconnected network at the neurological synapse [103,104]. They are linked to synaptic vesicles, cytoskeletal proteins and Ca²⁺ channels, and ensure correct localization of all components. Following exocytosis, an efficient compensatory endocytic process has been shown at the neurological synapse, which rapidly restores the functionality of the presynapse [102]. Piccolo and actin-interacting proteins are postulated to participate in the temporal and spatial coordination of synaptic vesicle exocytosis and endocytosis. The observation of a bidirectional vesicular traffic within the cSMAC of NK cells suggests the presence of as yet undefined functionally equivalent proteins at the immunological synapse [101]. This may be required to ensure long-term cytotoxic capacity of CTLs and NK cells.

## Conclusions and perspectives

Overall, granule-dependent cytotoxic function of CTLs and NK cells is an efficient way of rapidly eliminating unwanted cells and controlling immune responses. This function is promoted by the storage of cytotoxic proteins in specific granules and their tightly regulated delivery at the point of contact with the target cell. Despite recent progress in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of cytotoxic granule polarization and exocytosis, there is much left to be discovered. Biogenesis of cytotoxic granules from the endosomal compartment requires better characterization. For example, it is not clear to what extent the ESCRT machinery sorts components of the cytotoxic granules, participates in the formation of the multivesicular bodies of the granule coat and is connected with the AP3 sorting pathway. Similarly, clarification of the morphology of the mature cytotoxic granules and of the features that differentiate those involved in secretion from those involved in degradation is needed. The use of techniques for real-time imaging of both cargo and machinery in the endocytic process should be of help and provide quantitative data on the exocytosis of cytotoxic granules.

It is now clear that, given the importance and efficiency of the exocytic process by CTLs and the potential for harmful consequences of inappropriate cytotoxic granule exocytosis, the process has several layers of regulation. Indeed all steps of the process from granule

biogenesis, polarization, maturation, interaction with the plasma membrane and recycling are candidate checkpoints for regulation. Additional proteins that downregulate or transiently halt this process have been proposed. They might facilitate precise timing of the secretion and its synchronization with other processes, such as compensatory endocytosis, and modulate the sensitivity of Ca²⁺ influx that regulates secretion. Proteins that interact with SNARE complexes could be good candidates for these functions.

Studies of rare human diseases, and their mouse models, that affect the cytotoxic function of lymphocytes have revealed the crucial role of the cytotoxic pathways in regulation of the immune response. They have also been instrumental for the characterization of the discrete steps that regulate the cytotoxic function of T and NK cells. The study of similar inherited conditions that are yet to be molecularly characterized or of engineered mutant animals should also uncover additional proteins involved in this process.
