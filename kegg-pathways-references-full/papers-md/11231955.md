Synthesis of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA genome occurs within the viral nucleocapsid in a mechanistically ordered fashion. The nucleocapsid contains small pores that permit influx of nucleotide triphosphates and metabolites of nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine for DNA synthesis. Lamivudine is a potent inhibitor of HBV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) reverse transcriptases, but substitutions of isoleucine or valine for methionine within the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif are associated with virologic and clinical resistance to lamivudine therapy. Under lamivudine selection pressure, the high viral production rate and the low fidelity viral polymerase contribute to frequent development of the YMDD mutants. However, the pattern and dynamics of emergence of the mutant viruses over the wild-type virus are determined by multiple factors including replication efficiency, host immune response, and availability of replication space. Structural modeling of HIV reverse transcriptase has permitted key insights into the molecular basis of lamivudine resistance of HBV based on evolutionary relatedness of HIV and HBV. The side groups of isoleucine and valine of the YMDD mutants sterically prevent lamivudine from appropriately configuring into the nucleotide binding site of the reverse transcriptase. Aminotransferase flares are associated with lamivudine therapy and may signify clinical resistance with emergence of YMDD mutants. They may also herald the recovery phase with seroconversion and viral clearance. Reconstitution of the endogenous anti-HBV immune response may be equally important in the control of viral replication by lamivudine and other nucleoside analogues.

Immune response and destruction of infected hepatocytes and herald disease remission as manifested by the loss of hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and low or undetectable viral titers. Lamivudine is a nucleoside analogue that inhibits HBV replication at the level of DNA synthesis. Like human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), lamivudine treatment for HBV has resulted in the emergence of drug-resistant mutants, especially with longer duration of treatment. Aminotransferase flares associated with lamivudine have been reported early during treatment and more recently with prolonged therapy in the face of viral resistance.³⁻⁵ The clinical significance of these flares during lamivudine therapy remains the subject of much debate. As with interferon-induced flares, lamivudine-induced flares may suggest an enhanced immune response to HBV.

Specific mutations in the tyrosine-methionine-aspartate-aspartate (YMDD) motif of the HBV polymerase gene appear to confer resistance to lamivudine.⁶ The evolutionary similarity of HIV and HBV has provided insight into a possible structural mechanism for lamivudine resistance. The appearance of the YMDD mutants during lamivudine therapy has been associated with lower viral titers compared with the pretreatment wild-type virus titers and may reflect less “fitness” of the mutant viruses in vivo.

Several factors may contribute to the development of clinical resistance and flares associated with lamivudine treatment. This review will focus on the molecular and cellular basis of lamivudine resistance and aminotransferase flares in light of our current understanding of the virology and pathogenesis of HBV infection.

HBV Replication

The life cycle of HBV has been elucidated from studies in animal models and tissue cultures. The mature virion or Dane particle consists of an outer lipid bilayer that contains the viral envelope proteins and surrounds a nucleocapsid core. Within the nucleocapsid resides the viral genome, which is a partially double-stranded DNA with cohesive overlapping 5′ ends that maintain a relaxed circular structure. Four overlapping open reading frames are encoded by the compact, 3.2-kilobase (kb) pair viral genome: envelope surface proteins (hepatitis B surface antigen), nucleocapsid (core), X protein, and the reverse transcriptase/polymerase (pol).

The replication cycle of HBV is schematically illustrated in Figure 1. HBV infection is initiated when the Dane particle attaches to and enters a suitable host cell. Although the candidates for the cellular receptor(s) of HBV have been numerous, none of them have been unequivocally confirmed. On the other hand, the cellular receptor or a component of the receptor complex for duck HBV has been shown to be the carboxypeptidase D. Between viral entry and detection of HBV in the nucleus, the viral genome is converted from the relaxed circular form into a double-stranded covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The cccDNA serves as the template for the synthesis of all viral transcripts involved in viral protein production and replication. The 3.5-kb messenger RNA codes for both the core and pol proteins and functions as the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) for viral replication. The 2.4- and 2.1-kb transcripts encode the surface envelope proteins and the 0.7-kb transcript encodes the X protein. Host RNA polymerase is used for viral messenger RNA synthesis. In addition, the viral RNAs contain a posttranscriptional regulatory sequence element that is required for efficient processing and transport.

Replication of the HBV genome occurs in the nucleocapsids. The encapsidation and reverse transcription of the pgRNA involves specific interactions of viral and host proteins in a sequential fashion. The viral pol initiates encapsidation by binding to the 5′ encapsidation signal, epsilon, a secondary structure on the pgRNA. The pol-epsilon interaction is followed by complexing with the core proteins to form nucleocapsids. The pol-epsilon interaction is also the first step in initiating reverse transcription of pgRNA to yield the negative DNA strand of the viral genome. First, pol binds to the 5′ encapsidation signal and serves as the primer for the initiation and synthesis of a 3 or 4 nucleotide nascent DNA strand that is covalently attached to the pol. The pol-oligonucleotide complex then translocates to the 3′ direct repeat on the pgRNA that is complementary to the short oligonucleotide and proceeds to synthesize the negative DNA strand while concomitantly degrading all

but the last 15–18 nucleotides on the 5′ end of the pgRNA. This short RNA then translocates to the complementary 5′ end of the newly synthesized negative DNA strand and serves as the primer for the synthesis of the positive DNA strand. When the positive DNA strand has been extended to the end of the negative strand, a template strand switch occurs and allows for the circularization of the genome. At least 3 host proteins appear to be involved in the pol-epsilon binding process. Host chaperone proteins Hsp90, Hsp70, and the co-chaperone p23 interact with the pol-epsilon complex in an adenosine triphosphate-dependent fashion. The co-chaperone p23 and Hsp70 seem to facilitate pol binding to the epsilon, whereas Hsp90 may facilitate the subsequent translocation events.¹²,¹³ At this point, the nucleocapsids can either replenish the nuclear cccDNA pool or complete the maturation process by entering the endoplasmic reticulum to acquire the viral envelope and eventually be released from the host.¹⁴,¹⁵

With the advances in cryoelectron microscopy and computational technology, the ultrastructural features of the HBV nucleocapsids have been resolved at the atomic level (Figure 2).¹⁶ The particles have a pore size of 2 nm in diameter and therefore can limit access to biomolecules. Because HBV replication occurs predominantly within the nucleocapsid, it is important to consider this structural aspect for the design of antiviral compounds targeted at viral replication. Because nucleoside triphosphates can readily permeate into nucleocapsids as shown by the previously used HBV DNA polymerase assay, nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine are ideally suited for this purpose.

### HBV Polymerase

The HBV polymerase gene has sequence homology to other viral reverse transcriptases. The multifunctional nature of the HBV pol is defined by distinct domains: an N-terminal protein that serves as the primer for reverse transcriptase, a spacer region of undefined function, the reverse-transcriptase domain, and a ribonuclease H.¹⁷ The reverse-transcriptase domain has been further divided into 5 subdomains designated A through E. Based solely on sequence homology to other viral reverse transcriptases, a 3-dimensional HBV polymerase structure has been modeled. It assumes a right-handed conformation similar to other viral reverse transcriptases with a thumb, palm, and finger domains.¹⁸ Domains A, C, and D are most likely involved in deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) binding and catalysis and correspond structurally to the finger domains, whereas domains B and E interact with the RNA template and primer and correspond structurally to the thumb and palm domains.¹⁹,²⁰

The C domain of HBV reverse transcriptase contains the YMDD motif, which is highly conserved in other viral polymerases.²¹ In persons chronically infected with HBV or HIV, substitution of either valine or isoleucine for the amino acid position 552 methionine (M552V or M552I, respectively) in the YMDD motif has been associated with lamivudine resistance.¹⁷ Studies of drug-resistant mutations of HIV reverse transcriptase have yielded much information on the mechanisms of nucleoside resistance, some of which may be applicable to lamivudine-resistant HBV polymerase. The structure of HIV reverse transcriptase has been deduced by x-ray crystallography and has the typical right-handed structural conformation of thumb, palm, and finger domains.²²–²⁵ The palm and thumb domains make contact with the RNA template and primer, whereas the finger domains form components of the incoming dNTP binding pocket. Point mutations in the HIV reverse transcriptase that lead to nucleoside analogue resistance typically cluster in the vicinity of the dNTP binding site, which has a precisely configured structure. From the

crystallographic data, the YMDD mutation alters the ability of the dNTP binding pocket to accommodate lamivudine. When the methionine is replaced by valine or isoleucine, the new amino acid side chain projects into the dNTP binding site. Steric hindrance of lamivudine binding is observed when it is modeled into the dNTP binding pocket of the YMDD mutations (Figure 3B).^{19,20} The β-branched side group of valine or isoleucine impinges on the oxathiolane ring structure of lamivudine, thus impeding its optimal positioning in the dNTP pocket. Specifically, the β-branched side group competes against the sulfur atom of lamivudine for the same space within the binding pocket. These alterations in the dNTP binding pocket can also hinder binding of the usual D-conformation nucleoside triphosphates. However, this interference occurs to a lesser degree because at the point of impingement, the valine and isoleucine side groups exert less steric hindrance on the nucleoside ring structure of the D-conformation nucleoside triphosphates as compared with the large sulfur atom of lamivudine.^{19,20}

Further analysis of the model suggests a second mechanism whereby the mutations can enhance resistance. The catalysis of the incoming dNTP to the elongating DNA strand is dependent on a precise spatial arrangement of the 5′ α-phosphate and the 3′ hydroxyl group. Alteration in the geometry of the reaction constituents can greatly diminish the efficiency of catalysis (Figure 3A). Despite the steric hindrance encountered by lamivudine in the dNTP binding site of YMDD mutant reverse transcriptase, its low-affinity occupation of the site is further compounded by a suboptimal nucleophilic attack geometry.^{19,20}

Other mutations of lamivudine-resistant HBV reverse transcriptase occur outside the dNTP binding site. One of them is a leucine-to-methionine change at position 528 in the B domain and occurs in parallel with the methionine to valine change at position 552.^{18,26,27} A similar mutation in the HIV reverse transcriptase has not been observed. Alone, the L528M mutation has a mild effect on HBV replication compared with the single M552V mutation; however, the replication efficiency seems to be improved when combined with the M552V mutation.^{28} Structurally, this upstream methionine mutation is in close proximity to the valine mutation in the dNTP binding site and may modify lamivudine binding.^{18}

Cross-resistance by the YMDD variants to other nucleoside analogues is of a major clinical concern. Adefovir dipivoxil is a nucleoside analogue that has been evaluated in clinical trials for chronic HBV and HIV infections. Unlike lamivudine, adefovir has activity against the YMDD mutant reverse transcriptase in vitro and in vivo.^{29,30} Adefovir suppressed viral replication in patients who had acquired the YMDD variants in the setting of lamivudine treatment.^{30} Structurally, adefovir differs from lamivudine in that it is an acyclic nucleoside analogue, which may account for its ability to avert the steric hindrance imposed by the valine or isoleucine side group (Figure 3B).^{31}

The structure-function predictions based on the YMDD mutant of HIV reverse transcriptase have another direct implication to the functions of the mutant HBV polymerase. The sequence similarities between the mutant HIV and HBV reverse transcriptases suggest that the same level of dNTP binding and replicative efficiencies should be observed. With either the YIDD or YVDD virus, Melegari et al.^{28} demonstrated a reduced replicative capacity compared with the wild-type HBV, and the replication impairment was further enhanced in a nucleoside-depleted state. Based on the structural revelations of the mutant reverse transcriptase, it was expected that a much higher concentration of dNTP would be required for efficient binding.^{19,20} These findings are compatible with the prediction of impaired dNTP binding that would be accentuated in a low dNTP concentration state and illustrate the close resemblance between the HIV reverse transcriptase and the HBV polymerase.

## Viral Dynamics and Emergence of Mutations

The pattern and kinetics of HBV resistance to lamivudine can be explained in terms of a balance among mutational efficiency, replication space, and selection pressure. Mechanisms of mutation provide the necessary molecular framework within which the virus can evolve. Many viruses have unique patterns of mutations. HBV, like HIV, is more prone to a specific type of mutation that reflects the mutational bias of the reverse transcriptase and the cellular mechanisms of mutagenesis. The reverse transcriptase is more likely to introduce a G-to-A transition than other mutations.^{32,33} On the other hand, RNA editing through the deamination pathway can lead to the occurrence of A-to-G or C-to-U transitions.^{34,35} The evolution of these mutational biases must be balanced against the replication fitness of the resulting mutants. For example, if the G-to-A transition results in a viral species that replicates less efficiently than the other mutations, it may not emerge as the dominant species. In HIV lamivudine resistance, the YIDD mutant is detected at an early stage as a result of mutational bias of HIV reverse transcriptase but is then replaced by the YVDD mutant, apparently because of a more efficient replication capability compared with the YIDD mutation.^{36} A similar situation may also be evident in the

selection of HBV lamivudine mutants. Furthermore, because of the overlapping open reading frames and cis-acting regulatory elements, the same mutation often affects more than one genetic element within the HBV genome. Most of the lamivudine-resistant mutations in the polymerase gene also affect the overlapping surface gene. Such an effect may be deleterious to the functions of the surface gene products, thus negatively compromising the replication fitness of the mutant. Finally, compensatory mutation(s) may occur in other regions of the reverse transcriptase and cause functional alteration of the original mutation.³⁷ This possibility further complicates the distribution dynamics of viral mutants.

The rate of HBV virion production in vivo can influence the production of genetic variants. When compared with HIV and hepatitis C virus, HBV production rate is considerably higher. Estimates of daily HBV production is in the order of 10¹¹ virions compared with 10⁹ for HIV and hepatitis C virus.³⁸ The half-life of HBV in plasma ranges from 1 to 3 days.³⁹,⁴⁰ With this prodigious daily virion production, errors of the replication process are bound to occur. Unlike DNA polymerases, viral reverse transcriptases do not have a proofreading activity that can excise a misincorporated dNTP.⁴¹ The error rate of the HBV reverse transcriptase has been estimated to occur at a rate of 10⁻⁴ per base per replication cycle. Thus, on a daily basis, approximately 10¹⁴ bases are replicated with potentially 10¹⁰ base pairing errors. Should a viable mutation occur, the expansion of the virus harboring this mutation is predicated on the functional consequences of the mutation. In the absence of an intact immune system or other selection pressures, the faster replicating variant would be expected to outgrow the slower viruses. This seems to be the case in the setting of a newly infected liver, but as the liver becomes fully infected the difference in viral enrichment becomes diminished.⁴²

The dynamics and tropism of HBV replication within an infected host seem to modulate the biological consequences of HBV mutations. The potential of the liver to accommodate new HBV cccDNA has been termed the replication space.⁴²,⁴³ Although HBV may infect tissues other than liver, the contribution of these sites is likely to be negligible to the hepatic replication space. In essence, the maximum capacity of cccDNA in a liver is limited by the number of hepatocytes that can be infected and by the maximum number of cccDNA copies per hepatocyte. In a fully infected liver, the synthesis of new cccDNA can occur only if uninfected cells are generated by growth of the liver, hepatocyte turnover, or loss of cccDNA from infected hepatocytes. In the absence of selection pressure, an emerging virus strain can prevail over pre-existing strains via competitive growth only in the setting of hepatocyte turnover or cccDNA loss.⁴³ Therefore, the enrichment of one species over another implies that the expanding virus has augmented its population via an expansion of cccDNA synthesis. However, if there is limited initiation of new infections, which is often the case in a chronically infected liver, the expansion of a YMDD variant in a persistently infected liver is only possible with the creation of new replication space.⁴³ This is in contrast to the rapid emergence of HIV mutants in infected persons because the primary reservoir of HIV infection, the lymphocytes, has a much higher turnover rate than hepatocytes.

The concept of replication space may in part contribute to the observed lag period in patients before the development of lamivudine resistance.⁴⁴,⁴⁵ The emergence of YMDD mutants during lamivudine therapy may correspond to the loss of the wild-type cccDNA from the liver, thus allowing the mutants to expand. However, nuclear cccDNA seems to be quite stable and resistant to nucleoside analogue therapy. In animal models and tissue cultures, treatment with lamivudine and other nucleoside analogues does not result in any appreciable loss of the cccDNA in hepatocytes.⁴⁶ Despite these observations, patients with chronic hepatitis B probably have increased hepatocyte turnover, which provides the necessary replication space for the expansion of YMDD mutants.⁴⁰ Therefore, in the presence of lamivudine, the new YMDD mutants in the nascent virion pool can slowly replace the existing wild-type cccDNA.

During a viral infection, host immune response represents an important ongoing selection pressure on the emergence of HBV mutants. The character and magnitude of viral replication is often determined by compli-

The introduction of valine with its β-branched side chain for methionine at position 184 results in steric hindrance with the oxathiolane ring of lamivudine (blue), resulting in an altered binding position (magenta). The shift causes an increased distance between the 3′OH of the primer and the α-phosphate group of lamivudine, thus precluding chain termination.

cated interactions between the virus and host. A viral strain that has an advantage over the others in interacting with the hosts is likely to emerge as the dominant species. The emergence of immune escape and HBeAg-negative variants exemplifies the natural selection process by the host immune response.⁴⁷ Selection pressure by exogenous factors, such as antiviral therapy, is often accompanied by a similarly complicated process and consequences. The type of mutations associated with drug resistance is determined by the functionality of various mutations. Like HIV, specific HBV mutations may confer a stronger resistance to lamivudine and therefore are more fit to expand in the presence of lamivudine.²⁹ Likewise, as discussed below, the host immune response is also intimately involved in the clinical manifestations of lamivudine resistance, flares of hepatitis, and viral clearance.

### Lamivudine Treatment and Flares of Hepatitis

Two randomized clinical trials involving lamivudine treatment for HBV have shown decreases in HBV DNA by 2–3 logs.³⁴ One study was performed in Asia and the other in the United States, but both trials had similar 1-year results with respect to HBeAg loss. The presence of lamivudine-resistant mutants was also determined in the 2 studies. YMDD mutations were detected in 32% and 14% of the patients in the United States and Asian studies, respectively. With longer duration of therapy in the Asian study, 40% of the patients developed lamivudine-resistant mutants after 2 years of therapy.⁴⁸ Lamivudine-associated aminotransferase flares have been reported in the setting of therapy withdrawal and with the development of YMDD mutations.⁵,⁴⁹

How flares of hepatitis arise during lamivudine treatment has been the subject of much ongoing investigation. Acute exacerbations do occur frequently in the natural history of chronic HBV infection. What seems to trigger the process is a yet poorly understood interplay between the host immune responses and viral factors. Studies on the immunopathogenesis of HBV infection have defined multiple pathways of host immune responses (Figure 4), which are intricately involved in the control of viral replication and mechanisms of hepatocellular injury.⁴⁷,⁵⁰ Chronic HBV infection seems to display a certain hyporesponsiveness of antiviral T-cell immunity.⁵¹,⁵² Before a flare, an elevation of viral titer has been observed that is followed by an activation of anti-HBV cellular immunity. The immune response seems to be directed toward infected hepatocytes, resulting in increased hepatocellular death and clinical hepatitis.⁵³ An imbalance in the host immune response or emergence of viral variants probably brings about the enhanced viral

**Figure 4.** The multiple pathways of immunopathogenesis of HBV infection. After infection of hepatocytes, HBV is released into the circulation and acquired by antigen-presenting cells. Through major histocompatibility complex class II molecules, the viral antigens are presented to CD4 T helper cells, which in turn activate the B cells to produce neutralizing antibodies. The CD4 T cells provide help to the maturation of CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes, which is activated by the antigen-presenting cells through major histocompatibility complex class I molecules. Activation of both CD4 and CD8 cells requires involvement of costimulatory molecules. The HBV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes recognize HBV-infected hepatocytes in the context of class I molecules and directly kill the cells through induction of apoptosis. The activated lymphocytes produce inflammatory cytokines that exert predominantly a noncytopathic mechanism to suppress viral replication. In addition, the cytokines also recruit nonantigen-specific inflammatory cells including macrophages and other lymphocytes to the liver, which serve as a rich source of additional cytokines. The nonantigen-specific inflammatory cells and cytokines are primarily responsible for the systemic manifestations of hepatitis. Before induction of the acquired immunity described above, the resident native immunity including Kupffer cells, natural killer cells (NK), and natural killer T cells (NKT) is probably involved in the early phase of antiviral immune response, either through production of antiviral cytokines or direct cytotoxicity. These same immune responses are also the mediators of hepatocellular injury. During the course of HBV infection, these multiple pathways are operational and the consequences of these complex interactions result in the various manifestations of HBV infection in response to various natural or exogenous selection pressures.

replication, which in turn triggers additional immune response and causes a flare of hepatitis. A more auspicious prognosis may be attained if the antiviral immune response is sufficiently vigorous to control viral replication, resulting in loss of HBeAg and disappearance of HBV DNA.² These observations suggest that the presence of a partially active immune response to HBV may be essential for a positive treatment outcome. The development of YMDD mutations with long-term lamivudine treatment has apparently not precluded the development of aminotransferase flares with subsequent HBeAg seroconversion.⁴⁸ Favorable treatment outcome of chronic HBV with lamivudine, as with interferon alfa, has been associated with higher pretreatment aminotransferase levels, indicating the importance of an endogenous immune response.⁵³

Lamivudine does not seem to have any direct stimulatory effects on T cells.⁵⁴ To ascertain whether a reduc-

tion in HBV viral load or circulating antigen by lamivudine could affect the cellular immune response, Boni et al. 55 measured CD4-mediated responses before and during lamivudine therapy in patients with chronic HBV infection. When compared with the pretreatment state, an enhanced T-cell response against HBV was observed during lamivudine therapy. However, the immune response seemed to be nonspecific because recall antigen response was also enhanced. The enhancement of cellular immunity seemed to correlate with a reduction of the viral load. Though in need of further corroboration, this study suggests a possible mechanism by which lamivudine could set the stage for aminotransferase flares by suppressing viral replication and enhancing the endogenous immune response.

### Conclusion

Lamivudine treatment for chronic hepatitis B is associated with the development of the YMDD variants. These mutations arise as a result of the prodigious daily virion production coupled with the error-prone viral polymerase. Modeling from the structurally similar HIV reverse transcriptase suggests that the side groups of valine or isoleucine substituted for the methionine sterically prevent lamivudine from assuming the appropriate position in the catalytic site of the mutated polymerase, thus giving rise to virologic resistance.

Growth competition between wild-type and mutant viruses depends on the replicative efficiencies of each virus, the influence of the host immune system, and the availability of uninfected hepatocytes. The presence of lamivudine provides a selection advantage for the YMDD mutant virus. However, new replication space has to be created for expansion of the mutant virus either through turnover of hepatocytes or disappearance of wild-type cccDNA.

Despite the development of resistance, aminotransferase flares have been observed with lamivudine treatment. Like interferon therapy, these flares are often associated with treatment response and HBeAg/anti-HBe seroconversion. Reconstitution of anti-HBV immune response as a result of suppression of viral replication likely contributes to these flares. Despite lamivudine being a direct antiviral drug, the response of lamivudine treatment may ultimately depend on the endogenous immune response. This intriguing concept may emerge as a novel principle for the development of combination therapy for chronic hepatitis B.
