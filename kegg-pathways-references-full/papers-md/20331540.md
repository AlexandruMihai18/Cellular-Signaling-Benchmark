### Abstract

All segments of the gastrointestinal tract are comprised of an elaborately folded epithelium that expresses a variety of cell types and performs multiple secretory and absorptive functions. While the apical membrane expresses the electrolyte transporters that secrete or absorb electrolytes and water, basolateral transporters regulate the secretory or absorptive rates. During gastric acid formation, Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ and Na⁺/H⁺ exchange and other transporters secure Cl⁻ re-supply as well as pH and volume regulation. Gastric surface cells utilize ion transporters to secrete HCO₃⁻, maintain pHᵢ during a luminal acid load and repair damaged surface areas during the process of epithelial restitution. Na⁺/H⁺ exchange and Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransport serve basolateral acid/base import for gastroduodenal HCO₃⁻ secretion. The gastric and duodenal epithelium also absorbs salt and water. Recent molecular information on novel ion transporters expressed in the gastric and duodenal epithelium has exploded; however, a function has not been found yet for all transporters. The purpose of this review is to summarize current knowledge on the molecular identity and cellular function of basolateral ion transporters in the gastric and duodenal epithelium.

As a young scientist, Gunnar Flemström discovered the fact that isolated amphibian gastric and duodenal mucosa actively secretes HCO₃⁻ ions (Flemström & Sachs 1975, Flemström 1977, Flemström & Garner 1980, Flemström *et al.* 1982a). Williams and Turnberg, and Takeuchi and Silen for the stomach (Williams & Turnberg 1981, Takeuchi *et al.* 1983) and Gunnar Flemström and Eero Kivilaakso for the duodenum (Flemström & Kivilaakso 1983) found that these HCO₃⁻ ions together with the gastric acid in the lumen are able to generate a pH gradient in the mucus covering the surface cells with virtually neutral values near the surface cells despite an acidic lumen. They believed this ‘mucus-bicarbonate diffusion barrier’ to be one important component of the gastroduodenal defence mechanisms against the damaging effects of gastric acid (Flemström & Garner 1982, Flemström & Isenberg 2001, Allen & Flemström 2005). As the acid secretory rates in the stomach were much higher than those for HCO₃⁻ (Holton & Spencer 1976, Flemström 1977, Sjöstrand *et al.* 1977, Garner & Flemström 1978, 1978) and as gastric and duodenal mucin gels were found to provide no major barrier to H⁺ ion permeation (Takeuchi *et al.* 1983), this concept was much disputed

(Wallace 1989). It nevertheless stood the test of time, or, more correctly phrased, was proven correct by even the most advanced experimental techniques (Phillipson 2004, Sjöblom *et al.* 2009). While others still strove to delineate the role of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ secretion in the complex scenario of gastroduodenal mucosal protection, Gunnar and his group went far beyond the gastroduodenal epithelium and demonstrated that our central nervous system elaborately controls the output of $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ into the duodenal lumen (Flemström & Sjöblom 2005). Experts from all over the globe have gathered in this symposium in honour of Gunnar Flemström to highlight recent advances in gastrointestinal (GI) $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ transport and mucosal defence. It is a great honour to be allowed to be among them.

At the end of the 1990s, exploiting the new tools generated by the human genome project had resulted in an explosion of molecular information and had provided insight into a surprising variety of electrolyte transporters expressed in the different cell types and/or different regions of the GI tract, many of them with as yet unknown function. But one issue became clear: The relatively straightforward models that had been generated by working out cellular models based purely on functional experiments in the 1970s and 1980s (Flemström & Garner 1982, Allen *et al.* 1993, Flemström 1994) and then supplying these models with molecular details obtained by early cloning strategies in the early 1990s (Flemström & Isenberg 2001, Allen & Flemström 2005) were not wrong, but were by far not detailed enough. This has rekindled interest in the field and stirred hope that many current controversies between the findings of different laboratories and with the use of different agonists would be settled once new molecular structure–function relationships were established.

The widespread use of knockout mouse technology is currently allocating functional roles of the many new transporters. The process is painfully slow, because so far all attempts to generate cell culture models for the intestinal epithelium have met with moderate success. Nevertheless, a number of new findings have revolutionized our concepts regarding thinking about almost all aspects of gastroduodenal transport physiology. The purpose of this review is to summarize recently gathered information on the molecular identity and physiological function of the basolateral ion transport systems in the integrated function of the gastric and duodenal epithelium. The focus will be on those transport processes that are either unique (gastric acid) or most studied (duodenal bicarbonate) in this particular part of the GI tract respective segment of the GI tract, but other issues ($\mathrm{pH}$ and volume maintenance, epithelial restitution, salt and water secretion and absorption) will also be addressed.

### Basolateral electrolyte transporters of the gastric cells

#### Parietal cell basolateral transport pathways involved in gastric acid secretion

The unique ability of the gastric parietal cells to secrete large quantities of acid with up to $0.16 \, \mathrm{M}$ molar strength via the $\mathrm{H}^{+}/\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase would cause profound changes in cellular electrolyte composition, intracellular pH and cell volume, unless compensatory mechanisms are present. In particular, highly efficient pathways for $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ import and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ extrusion must exist, besides potent $\mathrm{pH}_{i}$ and cell volume regulators (Helander & Keeling 1993, Yao & Forte 2003, Sachs *et al.* 2007, Kopic *et al.* 2010). The parietal cell has fascinated scientists in many aspects: Its cellular architecture with apical membrane infoldings, $\mathrm{H}^{+}/\mathrm{K}^{+}$ ATPase carrying tubulovesicular membranes, and the enormous ultrastructural increase in apical membrane surface upon fusion of the tubulovesicles with the apical membranes were seen as correlates for the extremely high secretory capacity of each single cell; the very high number of mitochondria in each parietal cell underlined the energy-consuming work of gastric acid secretion (Agnew *et al.* 1999). As peptic ulcer disease-related morbidity and mortality was very high in the first two-thirds of the last decade, intense research activity started to understand parietal cell physiology, and we continue to be confronted with new answers to the questions that were asked in the early days of parietal cell research. A summary of currently identified parietal cell ion transporters that are potentially involved in gastric acid secretion is given in Figure 1.

#### Where do the protons in the HCl secretion come from?

In the middle of the last century, physiologists started to use isolated amphibian tissue to elucidate the mechanisms for acid secretion (Crane *et al.* 1948, Rehm & Hokin 1948, Davies 1950, Rehm 1953, Hogben 1955, Chalfin *et al.* 1958). They noticed that isolated sacs of frog mucosa excreted acid into the lumen and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$ into the serosal fluid at the same rates, suggesting that the protons are generated by $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ hydration (Davies 1950, Teorell 1951). Davenport had already suggested in a legendary series of studies performed on dogs with gastric fistulae, that carbonic anhydrase was the enzyme that converted $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ into $\mathrm{H}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}$, and that this enzyme was highly expressed in the stomach (Davenport 1939, 1968, Rangachari 2007). Maximal rates of acid secretion surpassed those of metabolic $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ production, and acid secretion rates were low in an oxygen-gassed phosphate buffer, suggesting that $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ was rate-limiting for acid secretory rate (Davies &

Figure 1 Ion transporters involved in HCl output and ion homeostasis of the parietal cell. (a) Based on electrophysiological, fluorometric and isotope flux studies a model was created two decades ago which depicted the apical H⁺, Cl⁻ and K⁺ efflux pathways and the basolateral ion transport mechanisms they may be able to establish the ion homeostasis. (b) Twenty years later, we have multiple molecular candidates for all transport pathways depicted in (a), except for the H⁺/K⁺ ATPase. The next years will require the elucidation of the exact physiological function and regulation of these many transport proteins expressed in the parietal cell.

Longmuir 1948, Davies & Roughton 1948, Davies 1950). However, high rates of acid secretion could be maintained even in the absence of external CO₂ when the serosal side is acidified to low pH values, or when zwitterionic buffers such as HEPES or PIPES were in the incubation medium (Sanders et al. 1973). Kidder & Montgomery (1974) found that physiological CO₂ tensions are not sufficient for maximal acid secretion. Eichenholz et al. (1967) noticed that when acid secretion was stimulated in anaesthetized dogs, the increase in plasma HCO₃⁻ in the venous blood was higher than that expected by CO₂ hydration from arterial blood CO₂ and metabolic CO production of the gastric mucosa. And while carbonic anhydrase inhibition did inhibit acid secretion (McGowan et al. 1952), some researchers found that Cl⁻ secretion was more affected than proton secretion (Hogben 1955), while others related to effects to systemic acid-base balance rather than inhibition of parietal cell CO₂ hydration (Janowitz et al. 1957, Hersey & High 1971). All these findings cast doubt on the concept that the protons needed for acid secretion are derived from CO₂ hydration, and that gastric carbonic anhydrases are really necessary to produce the protons.

Completely new light is shed on these findings with the molecular characterization, the subcellular localization and the potential functional roles of the many different carbonic anhydrase isoforms (Parkkila 2000, Breton 2001, Kivela et al. 2005, Supuran 2008). Evidence has accumulated that different carbonic anhydrase isoforms are located in the cytoplasm, in the basolateral, and in the apical membranes of epithelial cells in the duodenum. These carbonic anhydrases may form ‘transport metaboloms’ with a number of Cl⁻ and HCO₃⁻ transporters, accelerating their transport rates (Sterling et al. 2001, McMurtrie et al. 2004, Alvarez et al. 2005, Becker & Deitmer 2007) and may even be important in ‘proton gradient dissipation’ completely independent of the availability of CO₂ (Becker & Deitmer 2008). Carbonic anhydrase (CA) II-deficient

mice show an upregulation of the membrane-bound, basolateral located, CAIX (Pan *et al.* 2006). CAIX has been shown to interact with the Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger AE2 (Morgan *et al.* 2007), which is essential for Cl⁻ import during acid secretion. The physiological significance of these findings is unclear, but once studied, may provide new insight into the role of the gastric CAs for acid secretion, independent of providing protons through CO₂ hydration for the H⁺/K⁺ ATPase.

**Where does the Cl⁻ in the HCl secretion come from?**

During their observation of electrical phenomena in isolated frog gastric mucosa, the group of Warren Rehm noticed that the basolateral entry step for Cl⁻ ions during stimulation of acid secretion did not appear to be accompanied by charge. Based on electric circuit analysis, the group suggested a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange mechanism as the major basolateral Cl⁻ uptake pathway (Rehm & Sanders 1975). A decade later, after the development of cell-permeable pH-sensitive fluorophores that allowed the measurement of intracellular pH in cells without micropuncture (Rink *et al.* 1982, Paradiso *et al.* 1984), a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange process in the basolateral membrane of parietal cells was demonstrated more directly (Muallem *et al.* 1985, 1988, Paradiso *et al.* 1987a, 1989, Seidler *et al.* 1989, 1992, 1994, Lamprecht *et al.* 1993). As a molecular correlate, expression of the Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger AE2 (SLC4A2) was reported in the stomach of different species (Jons *et al.* 1994, Stuart-Tilley *et al.* 1994, Cox *et al.* 1996, Zolotarev *et al.* 1996, Rossmann *et al.* 2001a), with a specific distribution of splice variants leading to a predominant expression of AE2b in parietal cells (Rossmann *et al.* 2001a), and functional studies revealed 4,4′-diisothiocyanostilbene disulfonic acid (DIDS) sensitivity of the observed anion exchange as well as the acid secretory function (Muallem *et al.* 1988, Paradiso *et al.* 1989, Seidler *et al.* 1992, 1994). When AE2 was disrupted in mice, acid secretion was absent, the development of parietal cell tubulovesicles and secretory canaliculi severely impaired, and parietal cells less abundant (Gawenis *et al.* 2004), arguing for an important role of this transporter for acid secretion as well as parietal cell development. Interestingly, a mouse lacking AE2a and AE2b, but not the parietal cell-specific splice variant AE2c1, displays a normal basal parietal cell acid secretory rate and no maldevelopment of parietal cells, but a strongly reduced response to secretagogues (Recalde *et al.* 2006). In adult murine stomach, AE2 is detected immunohistochemically predominantly if not exclusively in the parietal cells in the upper part of the gastric glands, whereas H⁺/K⁺ ATPase is expressed in parietal cells throughout the gastric gland (McDaniel & Lytle 1999, McDaniel *et al.* 2005). This

raises the question if the parietal cells in the lower part of the gastric glands engage in acid secretion at all, and, if so, what Cl⁻ uptake mechanisms they use.

While AE2 is sensitive to low concentrations of DIDS, several groups have only found impaired acid formation with high concentrations of this inhibitor, namely 200–1000 μM, which points to the possible existence of yet another basolateral transporter. The discovery of a new member of the SLC26 family, SLC26A7, was recently reported (Lohi *et al.* 2000, 2002). It is basolaterally expressed in the stomach and the kidney, but not in the intestine, with high levels in gastric parietal cells (Petrovic *et al.* 2003). In oocytes, SLC26A7 was found to function as a Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchanger, and it was thus suggested to be a Cl⁻ import and HCO₃⁻ extrusion pathway during acid secretion (Petrovic *et al.* 2003). In line with a role in parietal cells, H⁺ formation was inhibited by basolateral NPPB, which was found to be an inhibitor of SLC26A7, and high concentrations of DIDS in hand-dissected rat gastric glands (Kosiek *et al.* 2007). In SLC26A7-deficient isolated gastric mucosa, however, maximal acid secretory rates were similar to that in wildtype at weaning, but were significantly reduced by approx. 25% at adult age (Xu *et al.* 2009). Slc26a7 could thus be the alternative Cl⁻ loading mechanism in the base of the glands. Another group described only minimal HCO₃⁻ transport of SLC26A7 when transfected into HEK293 cells, and characterized it as a pH-dependent Cl⁻ channel (Kim *et al.* 2005). As the HCO₃⁻ permeability of Slc26a7 increased at a more alkaline pHᵢ, the authors speculated that Slc26a7 may act as an additional base extruder (but not Cl⁻ loader) during acid secretion. They also speculated about potential conductive Cl⁻ loading via Slc26a7 during acid secretion. As parietal cells were found to hyperpolarize during stimulation of acid secretion (Ueda *et al.* 1987, Ueda & Okada 1989, Kotera *et al.* 1991), which would counteract conductive Cl⁻ import, it is difficult to envision conductive Cl⁻ entry during acid secretion.

Sakai *et al.* performed detailed studies on a small conductance Cl⁻ channel in isolated rabbit gastric glands (Sakai *et al.* 1989, Sakai & Takeguchi 1993). This Cl⁻ channel governed the resting state membrane potential, closed when superoxide ions were produced in parietal cells, for example during interleukin-1β exposure (Mizuma *et al.* 1994, Sakai & Takeguchi 1994, Sakai *et al.* 2003), and opened by prostaglandins (Sakai *et al.* 1992, 1995, Mizuma *et al.* 1994). Its role was seen in cellular survival rather than acid secretion. Reduced parietal cell viability could, of course, also explain the reduction in maximal acid secretory rates in adult Slc26a7 mice. Further experiments will have to show whether this Cl⁻ conductance may actually be mediated by Slc26a7.

Several studies focused on a potential role of Na⁺-K⁺-2Cl⁻ cotransporter (NKCC) as a Cl⁻-loading

mechanism during acid secretion, and demonstrated reduced acid formation in amphibians after incubation with loop diuretics (Soybel *et al.* 1995). However, bumetanide treatment did not impair acid secretion in murine gastric mucosa (McDaniel *et al.* 2005) or rat gastric glands (Kosiek *et al.* 2007) or volume regulation after secretagogue exposure in cultured rabbit parietal cells (Sonnetag *et al.* 2000). No numeric or ultrastructural changes were observed in parietal cells from NKCC1 (SLC12A2) knockout mice (Miller *et al.* 2002). NKCC is expressed in the gastric epithelium (Lytle *et al.* 1995), with particularly high levels in a subset of parietal cells located between the neck and the base of the gastric gland (McDaniel & Lytle 1999, McDaniel *et al.* 2005). Detailed analysis of the volume and contents of gastric secretions in NKCC1-deficient mice revealed that acid output was unaltered, but the volume of the gastric juice, as well as Na⁺, K⁺ and pepsinogen content was markedly diminished. In isolated gastric epithelium, bumetanide treatment or NKCC1 knockout did not reduce forskolin-stimulated acid secretory rate, but significantly decreased forskolin-stimulated short circuit current (*I*ₛₑ), suggesting that NKCC1 is needed for electrogenic anion secretion, and that this electrogenic anion secretion is in part responsible for gastric fluid, but not acid, secretion (McDaniel *et al.* 2005). This suggests that the significance of gastric NKCC may not lie in the parietal cell acid secretory machinery, but rather in fluid secretion of the gastric mucosa, and that this fluid is secreted secondary to electrogenic anion secretion, similar to the situation in the small and large intestine. In contrast to the situation in the intestine, however, the apical anion transporter for electrogenic anion secretion in the fundic part of the stomach is not CFTR (McDaniel *et al.* 2005). It will be important in this respect to assess the role of the Slc26 anion transporters which are expressed in the apical membranes of gastric epithelial cells (Petrovic *et al.* 2002, Xu *et al.* 2003, 2008b).

Furthermore, the Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransporter isoforms NBC1 (NBCe1, SLC4A4) and NBC2 (NBCn1, SLC4A7) (very low) are expressed in the basolateral membrane of parietal cells (Rossmann *et al.* 1999). The rabbit as well as murine gastric mucosa expresses exclusively the pancreatic isoform of NBCe1 (B. Riederer, unpublished observations), of which the coupling ratio of Na⁺ to HCO₃⁻ has been determined to be 1:2 (Gross *et al.* 2001a,b). This means that the transport direction of HCO₃⁻ will be into the cell (as in pancreatic ducts or duodenal enterocyte cells during HCO₃⁻ secretion) unless intracellular pH is high and basolateral membrane potential strongly negative. These conditions would not be met in resting state parietal cells (Sakai *et al.* 1989). However, during acid secretion parietal cell basolateral membrane has been found to hyperpo-

larize (Ueda *et al.* 1987, Schettino & Trischitta 1989, Ueda & Okada 1989, Kotera *et al.* 1991) and pHᵢ increases (Paradiso *et al.* 1989, Bachmann *et al.* 1998). Under these circumstances, the parietal cell NBCe1 may extrude HCO₃⁻. On the other hand, in the intestine, NBCe1 has been speculated to be linked to AE2 as an alternative Cl⁻ uptake mechanism to NKCC1 (Walker *et al.* 2002). A similar mechanism may exist in the parietal cell as a Cl⁻ mechanism that would be independent of intracellular CO₂ hydration. To search for a potential role of NBCe1 in acid secretion, isolated gastric mucosa of NBC1-deficient and WT mice were studied in Ussing chambers. NBCe1-deficient or WT mucosa after pharmacological inhibition of NBC1 displayed lower acid secretory rates compared with control tissue (P. Song, unpublished observations). Thus, the parietal cell NBCe1 plays a role in acid secretion, but the exact molecular mechanism of this function needs further clarification.

### pHᵢ and volume homeostasis during acid secretion

Keeping intracellular pH within an optimal range is crucial for cell metabolism and therefore cell survival (Boron 2004). Furthermore, secretion causes volume loss, which in turn leads to a regulatory volume increase for the cell to stabilize its shape, subcellular structure and concentration of cytoplasmatic components, and both processes involve Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger isoforms as well as Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange, Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransport and Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransport (Lang 2007).

When Na⁺/H⁺ exchange activity was first observed in the parietal cell membrane, it was implicated in ‘housekeeping’ functions such as pHᵢ- and cell volume regulation (Muallem *et al.* 1985, 1988, Paradiso *et al.* 1986, 1987b, Machen & Paradiso 1987, Starlinger *et al.* 1987, Machen *et al.* 1989, Seidler *et al.* 1989, 1992, Alper *et al.* 1999, Rossmann *et al.* 2001b). In early studies on parietal cell pH regulation during acid secretion, intracellular alkalinization was observed in HCO₃⁻-free buffers, which was partially attributed to the action of the proton pump (Muallem *et al.* 1988, Paradiso *et al.* 1989). However, it became clear that this effect is inhibited by amiloride derivatives and therefore largely mediated by Na⁺/H⁺ exchangers (Muallem *et al.* 1988, Bachmann *et al.* 1998). So far, 10 NHE isoforms have been found, of which NHE1-5, 8 and 10 are located at least in part in the plasma membrane (Malo & Fliegel 2006, Lee *et al.* 2008), whereas NHE 6, 7 and 9 have only been found in intracellular compartments (Nakamura *et al.* 2005). An obvious candidate for ‘housekeeping’ functions in the gastric mucosa is NHE1, which has been linked to a homeostatic role in different cell types. The highest expression levels of NHE1 are found in gastric mucous cells (Stuart-Tilley

Figure 2 The gastric surface cell provides first line defence against the acid lumen. An alkaline environment is built up near the apical surface of these cells, preventing acid damage to the enterocyte. While the apical ion transporters that provide the $HCO_3^-$ into this pre-epithelial alkaline layer are still under debate, it is clear that the gastric surface cell expresses particularly high levels of the basolateral base importers NHE1 and NBCe1.

et al. 1994, Rossmann et al. 2001b) (Fig. 2). However, NHE1-deficient mice show only mild histomorphological alterations in their gastric mucosa, including a thickening of the lamina propria and a slightly atrophic glandular mucosa (Bell et al. 1999). Consistent with the presence of NHE isoforms other than NHE1, treatment with a NHE1-specific concentration of HOE642 (Scholz et al. 1995) only partially inhibited parietal cell $Na^+/H^+$ exchange (Bachmann et al. 1998) and an expression of NHE2 as well as NHE4 in gastric parietal cells has been reported (Pizzonia et al. 1998, Rossmann et al. 2001b). Interestingly, both NHE2- and NHE4-deficient mice display an impressive gastric phenotype: NHE2 (SLC9A2) knockout mice exhibit a progressive loss of parietal cells and acid secretion decreases upon aging; the remaining parietal cells appeared histomorphologically normal, arguing for a specialized role of NHE2 in cell survival (Schultheis et al. 1998). In NHE4-deficient mice, the number of parietal cells is reduced and acid secretion significantly impaired (Gawenis et al. 2005). Another NHE isoform present in the stomach is NHE8 (SLC9A8), which is apically located in rat intestine (Xu et al. 2005a, 2008a), but membrane localization and functional relevance of the parietal cell are unresolved at present.

To test the hypothesis that NHE1, NHE2 and NHE4 fulfil different tasks in parietal cells, pH$_i$ was measured upon secretagogue stimulation in cultured rabbit parietal cells. While the carbachol-mediated pH$_i$ increase was completely blocked by 1 $\mu$M HOE642, the histamine- and forskolin-induced alkalization was inhibited by high doses of DMA only, indicating that NHE1 is activated during Ca$^{++}$-dependent, and NHE1, 2 and 4 during cAMP-dependent stimulation (Rossmann et al. 2001b). Interestingly, disruption of the actin cytoskeleton partially inhibited $Na^+/H^+$ exchange activation, and hyperosmolarity equally caused NHE activation, both of which suggested that NHE isoforms might be involved in parietal cell volume regulation. Indeed, confocal volume measurements confirmed that RVI followed by secretagogue stimulation was sensitive to NHE inhibition (Sonntag et al. 2000). To further clarify which NHE isoforms are involved in parietal cell volume regulation, cultured parietal cells were subjected to hyperosmolar solution in pH$_i$- and volume measurements in the presence of different NHE inhibitors and inhibitor concentrations (Sonntag et al. 2000, Bachmann et al. 2007). NHE2 is expressed at relatively low levels in parietal cells and only minimally activated by hyperosmolarity, which is not supportive of the concept that this isoform regulates parietal cell volume and its lack causes decreased survival (Sonntag et al. 2000, Rossmann et al. 2001b, Bachmann et al. 2007). NHE1 and NHE4, the latter to a lesser extent, on the other hand, are important for parietal cell volume regulation on the basis of these studies (Bachmann et al. 2007).

One unresolved question is the subcellular localization of NHE2, which is targeted to the apical membrane of the kidney (Chambrey et al. 1997, 1998) and the intestinal epithelium (Hoogerwerf et al. 1996) in parietal cells. Apical localization would lead to proton extrusion into the lumen, which is not observed in Ussing chamber experiments where acid secretion is completely inhibited by omeprazole (P. Song, unpublished observations). Other theoretical considerations and functional results are supportive of basolateral NHE2 expression: NHE2 is strongly upregulated by extracellular alkalinity, which likely occurs in the interstitial space during acid secretion (Seidler et al. 1995). As a possible correlate, $Na^+/H^+$ exchange activity is increased in frog gastric mucosa upon serosal alkalization. However, more work is required to understand the paramount importance of NHE2 in the gastric epithelium.

$HCO_3^-$ secretion in the stomach

In the gastric mucosa, the investigation of the ion transporters involved in $HCO_3^-$ secretion have been hampered by the fact that (1) due to the thickness and high oxygen demand of mammalian gastric mucosa, studies in isolated gastric mucosa are largely restricted to the amphibian mucosa, which has a different cellular composition than the mammalian gastric mucosa and (2) acid secretion has to be inhibited in order to measure

Acta Physiol 2011, 201, 3–20

U Seidler *et al.* • Basolateral acid/base transporters in stomach and duodenum

gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretory rates. Therefore, the cellular origin of gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretion is not clear (Fig. 2).

When the gastric mucosa was found to secrete $HCO_3^-$, the obvious cell to do so was the gastric surface cell. $HCO_3^-$ secretion into the lumen could be measured when acid secretion was inhibited (Flemström 1977, Garner & Flemström 1978, Flemström & Garner 1982), but also, in an indirect way, in an acid-secreting stomach (Altamirano 1963, Garner & Flemström 1978, Feldman & Barnett 1985). Its existence, protective role for the gastric epithelium and involved transporters were controversially discussed for a long time (Wallace 1989). However, recent experiments leave no doubt that the luminal fluid directly above gastric surface cells becomes more alkaline when the stomach secretes acid (Phillipson 2004), and that this function is impaired in Helicobacter-infected mice (Henriksnas *et al.* 2006). In addition, Debellis *et al.* (1998) have measured $HCO_3^-$ secretion in the depths of the gastric glands in frog stomach that could be stimulated by cholinergic agents and shut off by histamine, and seemed to involve $HCO_3^-$ import into the secreting cells via NBC.

Mammalian gastric surface cells strongly express NHE1, NHE2, NBCe1 as well as carbonic anhydrase II, and are thus equipped with a number of transporters that have been shown to be involved in $HCO_3^-$ secretion in other epithelia (Lonnerholm *et al.* 1985, 1989, Igarashi *et al.* 1992, Alper *et al.* 1999, Rossmann *et al.* 1999, 2001b). However, due to the very short lifespan of NHE1- and NBCe1-deficient mice, studies measuring their gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretory rates, even if they would be performed, may be fraught with experimental shortcomings. NHE2-deficient mice have severe gastric mucosal changes, preventing the delineation of the physiological significance of this NHE isoform in the gastric mucosa to this day (Schultheis *et al.* 1998).

Several lines of evidence suggest that cells at the base of the glands may also be involved in anion, fluid and possibly $HCO_3^-$ secretion. In addition to measurements of base secretion from the gland depth (Curci *et al.* 1994, Debellis *et al.* 1994, 1998, Caroppo *et al.* 1997), a number of transporters are expressed in the cells deep in the glands that are involved in fluid movement, but have not been found important for acid secretion (Fujita *et al.* 1999, McDaniel & Lytle 1999, Wang *et al.* 2000, McDaniel *et al.* 2005, Bajwa *et al.* 2009). However, as the cellular origin of this base secretion is not well defined, the basolateral $HCO_3^-$ supply pathways remain to be defined.

$pH_i$ maintenance in gastric epithelial cells during an acid load

The enormous resistance of the gastric mucosa to luminal acid has stimulated particular interest in the

$pH_i$ regulatory mechanisms of the gastric surface cells. This question is, of course, only relevant if luminal protons can enter the epithelial cell layer, an issue that has been controversially debated (Silen & Skillman 1973, O’Brien *et al.* 1975, Wallace 1989, Waisbren *et al.* 1994). While Waisbren *et al.* (1994) microdissected and luminally perfused gastric glands and found a very low apical proton permeability, Kaneko *et al.* (1991) observed a rather profound decrease in surface cell $pH_i$ upon luminal acid perfusion in the rat stomach *in vivo*, which was further enhanced by $Na^+/H^+$ exchange inhibition with an amiloride analogue (Kaneko *et al.* 1992). Kiviluoto *et al.* (1993) studied both intracellular and pre-epithelial surface pH during a luminal acid load in the Necturus antrum, and found clear evidence for (1) an intracellular pH decrease during a luminal acid load of pH 2.5 and (2) the important role of a pre-epithelial mucus layer as well as $HCO_3^-$ secretion. We stepwise decreased luminal pH in isolated frog gastric mucosa and found no change in $pH_i$ down to a luminal pH of 3, but at pH 2, surface cell $pH_i$ decreased slightly to a new pH. Interestingly, this $pH_i$ decline was strongly dependent on interstitial buffer capacity, and a high interstitial buffer capacity was essential for the gastric epithelial cells to regulate their $pH_i$ (Stumpf *et al.* 1993, Seidler *et al.* 1995). Phillipson *et al.* studied the pH directly above gastric surface cells with pH-sensitive microelectrodes and found their ability to keep surface cell pH neutral dependent on acid secretory activity, prostaglandin production and inhibition by DIDS (Synnerstad *et al.* 2001, Phillipson *et al.* 2002). These observations suggest that gastric epithelial cells are in need of $pH_i$ regulatory mechanisms to neutralize luminal protons that diffuse into the epithelial layer, possibly through areas where the barrier properties are weakened. So what is known about the ion transport mechanisms that perform this task? Gastric surface cells have been found to express particularly high levels of NHE1 (Stuart-Tilley *et al.* 1994, Rossmann *et al.* 2001b). NHE2 is also very strongly expressed in surface cells, and both isoforms are sensitive to amiloride in the concentrations employed in the studies that demonstrate the importance of $Na^+/H^+$ maintenance after acid challenge (Kaneko *et al.* 1992, Furukawa *et al.* 1999). NHE2 has been demonstrated to be apically located, although not uniformly so (Wang *et al.* 1993, Soleimani *et al.* 1994, Hoogerwerf *et al.* 1996, Chambrey *et al.* 1998, Su *et al.* 2003, Guan *et al.* 2006), and a concept for a role of NHE2 in $pH_i$ regulation during acid challenge would require a basolateral localization. NBCe1 is also most strongly expressed in surface cells, and may also be involved in $HCO_3^-$ import when the surface cells are endangered by the high acid load (Rossmann *et al.* 1999, Akiba *et al.* 2001, Kaunitz & Akiba 2001). However, a

direct study of this concept would require some form of conditional knockout, because of the early death of the constitutive $Slc4a4^{-/-}$ mice. Thus, despite decades of research, the molecular mechanisms of ‘gastric barrier’ maintenance are still not fully understood.

### Basolateral electrolyte transporters involved in gastric epithelial restitution

At the end of the 1970s, researchers noticed that gastric epithelial cells are able to close a destroyed surface cell layer and form new electrically sealed ‘tight junctions’ within very short time periods (Svanes *et al.* 1982, Ito *et al.* 1984). This was achieved by migration of gastric cells from the glandular neck region over the denuded interstitial tissue, forming a new continuous epithelial cell layer, later followed by increased proliferative activity (Sorbye *et al.* 1988). The phenomenon of rapid wound closure by cellular migration was called ‘epithelial restitution’ and later recognized to occur in other areas of the GI tract (Lacy 1988, Feil *et al.* 1989b). To study the role of the luminal pH and the necessity of neutralizing $HCO_3^-$ to the process of restitution (Svanes *et al.* 1983, Feil *et al.* 1989a, Gronbech *et al.* 1989, Guttu *et al.* 1993, 1994), pure epithelial model systems were created in which many components of the restitutive process could be studied at the level of the epithelial cell (Dignass *et al.* 1994, Takahashi *et al.* 1995, Basque *et al.* 1999, Terano *et al.* 2001, Chailler & Menard 2005, Tetreault *et al.* 2008). Although it became clear that one of the key factors for epithelial migration and differentiation is strongly dependent on mesenchymal–epithelial interaction via signalling systems like hepatocyte growth factor (mesenchymal origin)-cMET receptor (epithelial location), pure epithelial systems are useful in delineating the molecular mechanisms of epithelial migration (Kato *et al.* 1999, Hayashi *et al.* 2007, 2009, Tetreault *et al.* 2008). In the migrating epithelial cell, the ion transport systems that are basolaterally located in the resident cell can be found in the lamellipodium or ‘leading edge’ of the migrating cell (Klein *et al.* 2000, Stock & Schwab 2006, Schwab *et al.* 2007). Na$^+$/H$^+$ exchange activation has been found essential for gastric epithelial restitution (Joutsi *et al.* 1996, Furukawa *et al.* 1999). The question remains whether this is due to the essential role of NHE1 in cell migration, studied in fibroblasts (Tominaga & Barber 1998) and transformed MDCK cells (Stock & Schwab 2006, Stock *et al.* 2008), or whether additional ion transporters are involved. This is feasible, because the lack of NHE2, for example, has been found to impair intestinal barrier restitution after ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the small intestine (Mooser *et al.* 2006, 2008). NBCe1 was also found to be involved in cell migration in an NHE1-mutated MDCK subclone (Schwab *et al.*

Basolateral acid/base transporters in stomach and duodenum • U Seidler *et al.* Acta Physiol 2011, 201, 3–20

2005). It would be interesting to develop novel experimental strategies to study the role of NHE2 and other ion transporters in gastric epithelial migration.

#### Basolateral electrolyte transporters of the epithelial cells in the duodenum

##### Role of $CO_2$ hydration and basolateral $Na^+/H^+$ exchange in $HCO_3^-$ supply for secretion

The first part of the duodenum is regularly exposed to very low pH. In humans, this happens predominantly during night-time, when gastric juice of very low pH accumulates in the gastric lumen and is emptied infrequently, but regularly into the duodenum. Via complex neuroendocrine, paracrine and possibly hormonal pathways, a very short contact of the duodenal mucosa with a low pH results in a long-lasting increase in duodenal $HCO_3^-$ secretion (Flemström *et al.* 1982a, Heylings *et al.* 1984, Odes *et al.* 1990), and in contrast to the $HCO_3^-$ secretion of the gastric mucosa, this alkaline secretion has long been accepted as a first line defence mechanism against peptic damage (Isenberg *et al.* 1986, 1987, Allen *et al.* 1993, Hogan *et al.* 1994, Knutson *et al.* 1995a, Myers *et al.* 1998, Flemström & Isenberg 2001, Allen & Flemström 2005). However, duodenal $HCO_3^-$ differs from gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretion in several important ways. Firstly, CFTR expression is essential for duodenal (Hogan *et al.* 1997, Seidler *et al.* 1997, Singh *et al.* 2008) but not for gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretion (U. Seidler & I. Blumenstein, unpublished observations). Secondly, the list of agonists that stimulate duodenal $HCO_3^-$ secretion include many of the classical CFTR channel activators that act via an intracellular cAMP elevation (Guba *et al.* 1996, Seidler *et al.* 1997) which does not elicit gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretion in the fundic region (Flemström *et al.* 1982b). And while prostaglandins stimulate both gastric and duodenal $HCO_3^-$ secretion, they do so via different prostaglandin receptors and receptor subtypes, as well as different second messenger systems (Takeuchi *et al.* 1997, 2005, Aoi *et al.* 2004, Aihara *et al.* 2005). Thirdly, the apical Slc26 isoforms involved in duodenal $HCO_3^-$ secretion are different from those involved in gastric $HCO_3^-$ secretion (Wang *et al.* 2005, Xu *et al.* 2005b, 2008b, Henriksnas *et al.* 2006, Tuo *et al.* 2006, Walker *et al.* 2009).

While many differences have long been known to exist between the apical transport apical mechanisms and signal transduction pathways for gastric and duodenal $HCO_3^-$ secretion, the $HCO_3^-$ supply mechanisms have been thought to be similar. This has recently turned out not to be correct. In mammalian duodenum, CA-mediated $CO_2$ hydration has been thought to be an important source of $HCO_3^-$ (Muallem

U Seidler et al.

- Basolateral acid/base transporters in stomach and duodenum

et al. 1994, Knutson et al. 1995a,b, Clarke & Harline 1998, Jacob et al. 2000, Alvarez et al. 2005). CA was found to have a villous-predominant expression in rats (Lonnerholm et al. 1989, Sugai et al. 1994), mice and rabbits (H. Rossmann, unpublished observations). When the rabbit duodenum was exposed to acetazolamide in the Ussing chamber, basal bicarbonate secretion was inhibited by 50%, while the secretory response to cAMP agonists was unchanged (Jacob et al. 2000). Likewise, when only Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ transport was inhibited by high concentrations of DIDS, basal HCO₃⁻ secretory rates decreased, but the secretory response to cAMP agonists was unchanged. However, when both the CO₂ hydration pathways and Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransport were inhibited, both basal HCO₃⁻ secretory rates and the HCO₃⁻ secretory response were dramatically inhibited. Altogether, the data suggested that intracellular CO₂ hydration and export of the protons via NHE1 into the interstitium was one important mechanism that mediates basolateral HCO₃⁻ uptake in duodenal mucosa, particularly in the resting state.

The surprise came when duodenal HCO₃⁻ secretion was studied in CAII knockout mice, which is the major carbonic anhydrase isoform in the duodenocyte (Igarashi et al. 1992, Sugai et al. 1994, Parkkila 2000, Kivela et al. 2005). CAII-deficient mice did not display a reduction in basal HCO₃⁻ rate and showed an even increased HCO₃⁻ secretory response to forskolin (Sjöblom et al. 2009). Likewise, a virtually complete inhibition of all duodenal CA isoforms by systemic and luminal administration of nonspecific CA inhibitors did not significantly reduce either basal or forskolin-stimulated HCO₃⁻ secretion in the anaesthetized mouse, but almost fully inhibited acid-stimulated HCO₃⁻ secretion in the same model. These results indicate that the role of CA-mediated CO₂ hydration in the generation of the HCO₃⁻ destined for secretion is not as straightforward as thought previously. The generation and study of isoform-specific and possibly conditional CA knockout will help clarify their exact role in the duodenum in the near future.

### Role of Na⁺HCO₃⁻ cotransport for duodenal HCO₃⁻ secretion

Functional studies of isolated amphibian duodenum in Ussing chambers provided early evidence for a dependency of HCO₃⁻ secretion on basolateral Na⁺, but at the time, an Na⁺-dependent HCO₃⁻ import mechanism was thought unlikely because a coupling of HCO₃⁻ and Na⁺ could not be detected (Simson et al. 1981a,b,c). Later, Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransport was shown to be present in isolated basolateral membrane vesicles of rabbit duodenal mucosa, and in Ussing chamber experiments, Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransport was demonstrated to mediate part of the basal and agonist-stimulated HCO₃⁻ import (Jacob et al. 2000). One likely candidate fulfilling this function is a splice variant of the electrogenic Na⁺/HCO₃⁻ cotransporter (SLC4A4, pNBC1, NBCe1-B), which was cloned from human pancreas and found to be expressed throughout the GI tract (Abuladze et al. 1998, Rossmann et al. 1999, Jacob et al. 2000, Damkier et al. 2007). Electroneutral NBCn1 (SLC4A7) is equally thought to function as a base loader (Amlal et al. 1999, Choi et al. 1999), and its expression on a PCR level was confirmed for the duodenum which also expresses NBCe1 and the NaBC1 (SLC4a11) (Damkier et al. 2007). After previous experiments had pointed to a subepithelial localization of the electroneutral NBC variant NBCn1(Bachmann et al. 2003), a recent study also demonstrated an epithelial expression of this transporter using beta-galactosidase staining (Boedtkjer et al. 2008). In murine duodenum, NBCe1 and NBCn1 both immunohistochemically localize to the basolateral membrane of the villi, whereas no signal was found in the crypts (Praetorius et al. 2001). Functional studies in this work using isolated duodenocytes pointed to HCO₃⁻ import, which can potentially be mediated by NBCe1 and NBCn1, and also HCO₃⁻ export, which is possibly enabled by NBCe1 to absorb HCO₃⁻ from the intestinal lumen. However, no pharmacological compounds for the reliable differentiation between NBCe1 and NBCn1 are available, and the question of the physiological significance of NBCn1 could not be clarified.

This has recently changed due to the generation of Slc4a7⁻/⁻ mice. Studies in these mice demonstrated that Slc4a7 (NBCn1) is of major importance as a HCO₃⁻ supply mechanism during agonist-stimulated secretion in both isolated duodenal mucosa and *in vivo*, and even more so during luminal acid-stimulated HCO₃⁻ secretion *in vivo*, which was almost abolished in the absence of NBCn1 (M. Chen, W. Zheng, F. Xiau, A. Singh, J. Prætorius, C. Aalkjar & U. Seidler, unpublished observations). Interestingly, no role for Slc4a4 (NBCe1) in duodenal HCO₃⁻ secretion of either WT or Slc4a7⁻/⁻ duodenum could be found, because serosally applied DIDS at a concentration of up to 500 μM, which should be completely inhibitory for NBCe1, did not significantly inhibit basal or agonist-stimulated HCO₃⁻ secretion in isolated murine duodenal mucosa. Inhibition of carbonic anhydrases by acetazolamide or CAII knockout *in vivo* did not significantly inhibit forskolin-stimulated HCO₃⁻ secretion in the WT duodenum, but reduced the residual HCO₃⁻ secretory response in Slc4a7⁻/⁻ duodenum *in vivo* by approx. 50%. Because NBCn1 is expressed in the villi only, this suggests that a very significant part of agonist- and even more so of luminal acid-stimulated HCO₃⁻ secretion is of villous origin. In its absence, other HCO₃⁻ supply mechanisms

gain importance, but cannot fully compensate for the lack of NBCn1.

This leaves the question open as to what mechanisms supply $HCO_3^-$ to the crypt cells, when both CA expression and NBC expression is villous predominant (Praetorius et al. 2001). Without doubt, the strongest CFTR expression can be found in the apical lining of the crypt epithelial cells (Ameen et al. 2000, Singh et al. 2009). On a molar basis, the duodenum of mice, rats and rabbits secrets more $Cl^-$ than $HCO_3^-$ in cAMP-mediated, CFTR-dependent anion secretory response (Guba et al. 1996; Spiegel et al., 2003). Thus, it is feasible that the anion secretion originating from the villous duodenocytes have a higher ratio of $HCO_3^-$ to $Cl^-$ in the anion secretion than the crypt cells. The $HCO_3^-$ supply pathway to the epithelial cells in the Brunner's glands, which presumably also participates in duodenal $HCO_3^-$ secretion, has not been characterized yet.

### Role of intracellular $pH_i$ regulation in duodenal mucosal defence

Because no animal models have been generated that closely resemble duodenal ulcer disease in humans, the role of $HCO_3^-$ secretion and its protective role during a luminal acid load has been discussed controversially. Because the absence of CFTR expression results in a reduced $HCO_3^-$ secretory response to agonist and acid stimulation (Hogan et al. 1997, Seidler et al. 1997, Clarke & Harline 1998, Singh et al. 2008), the low incidence of duodenal ulcer disease in patients with cystic fibrosis was called the 'CF paradox' and the importance of $HCO_3^-$ secretion questioned (Kaunitz & Akiba 2001). Subsequently, a series of papers demonstrated that the inhibition or genetic ablation of the CFTR channel resulted in a decreased duodenocyte acidification *in vivo* during luminal acid perfusion, and an increased $HCO_3^-$ import into the duodenocyte once luminal pH was returned to neutral values (Akiba et al. 2001, 2005, Hirokawa et al. 2004). Acid damage to villous tip duodenocytes was also reduced. The stilbene DIDS, on the other hand, enhanced both intracellular acidification during a luminal acid load, and villous tip damage. The authors concluded that the presence of CFTR in the luminal membrane enhanced intracellular acidification during a luminal acid load, because the CFTR channel is a $Cl^-/HCO_3^-$ channel, and thus augmented acid-induced injury. They suggested that rather than $HCO_3^-$ secretion into the lumen, the stimulation of $HCO_3^-$-importing transporters, most likely $Na^+/HCO_3^-$ cotransporters (because of the DIDS-sensitivity), by the low $pH_i$ was the most important protective factor for the duodenal mucosa. A recent study assessed the $pH_i$ change in murine duodenocytes

**Figure 3** A key factor for duodenal mucosal defence against peptic damage is the secretion and the intracellular presence of $HCO_3^-$. The apical transport systems are members of the Slc26 anion transporter gene family as well as the CFTR anion channels, and possibly as yet unknown transporters. $HCO_3^-$ supply occurs via intracellular $CO_2$ hydration and the basolateral uptake of base equivalents. Recent experiments have delineated the particular importance of the electroneutral $Na^+HCO_3^-$ cotransporter NBCn1 in $HCO_3^-$ import into $HCO_3^-$-secreting duodenocytes.

at different levels along the crypt-villus axis during a luminal acid challenge in a luminally perfused exteriorized duodenum in anaesthetized mice, using two-photon microscopy to increase the depths in which the fluorescence signal can be picked up (Sjöblom et al. 2009). The authors found that while the lower half of the villi is covered with a very viscous mucus gel that immediately builds up again after flushing, the upper part of the villi moved freely in the luminal perfusate. In the upper villous duodenocytes, a luminal pH of 2 resulted in rapid intracellular acidification to $pH_i$ of ~6.5 which lasted even after removal of the luminal acid load. In the lower villous duodenocytes, no change in $pH_i$ was observed during the perfusion phase. These data suggest that the two apparently opposing theories may be merged. A summary of currently identified acid/base transporters in duodenocytes is given in Figure 3.

### Summary

On the basis of studies in native GI tissue and whole animals, it is becoming increasingly clear that the basolateral electrolyte transporters are fundamental, molecularly diverse and actively regulated components of cell type and segment-specific transport function. Consequently, we now know that most transport phenomena that had been identified in the last decade by electrophysiological, fluorometric, isotope flux or

pH-stat titration techniques are a ‘sum signal’ derived from a group of ion transport proteins. The functional relevance of the differential expression patterns of these transporters along the gastric gland and duodenal crypt-villus axis is not fully understood; neither is the necessity for the several transport proteins of apparent similar ion transport function. The recent advances in the generation of conditional knockout mice, the establishment of complex heterologous coexpression systems, and the refinement of both optical techniques to study transport regulation at the cellular basis, as well as the performance of complicated measurements in living animals are likely to result in a redefinition of our transport models for gastric and duodenal transport functions. The cell type and signal specificity of many of these transporters theoretically open new targets for drug therapy. Given their increasingly acknowledged importance and the relatively small body of evidence compared with apical transport pathways, further studies on the basolateral electrolyte transporters of the GI tract in primary healthy as well as diseased mucosa are definitely required.
