### Abstract

Mesocortical dopamine (DA) inputs to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) play a critical role in normal cognitive processes and neuropsychiatric pathologies. This DA input regulates aspects of working memory function, planning, and attention, and its dysfunctions may underlie positive and negative symptoms and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. Despite intense research, there is still a lack of clear understanding of the basic principles of actions of DA in the PFC. In recent years, there has been considerable effort by many groups to understand the cellular mechanisms of DA modulation of PFC neurons. However, the results of these efforts often lead to contradictions and controversies. One principal feature of DA that is agreed upon by most researchers is that DA is a neuromodulator and is clearly not an excitatory or inhibitory neurotransmitter. The present article aims to identify certain principles of DA mechanisms by drawing on published, as well as unpublished data from PFC and other CNS sites to shed light on aspects of DA neuromodulation and address some of the existing controversies. Eighteen key features about DA modulation have been identified. These points directly impact on the end result of DA neuromodulation, and in some cases explain why DA does not yield identical effects under all experimental conditions. It will become apparent that DA's actions in PFC are subtle and depend on a variety of factors that can no longer be ignored. Some of these key factors include distinct bell-shaped dose-response profiles of postsynaptic DA effects, different postsynaptic responses that are contingent on the duration of DA receptor stimulation, prolonged duration effects, bidirectional effects following activation of D1 and D2 classes of receptors, and membrane potential state and history dependence of subsequent DA actions. It is hoped that these factors will be borne in mind in future research and as a result a more consistent picture of DA neuromodulation in the PFC will emerge. Based on these factors, a theory is proposed for DA's action in PFC. This theory suggests that DA acts to expand or contract the breadth of information held in working memory buffers in PFC networks.

1984; Lewis et al., 1998; Goldman-Rakic, 1998; Yang et al., 1999a; Tzschentke, 2001; Durstewitz and Seamans, 2002). These DA pathways include: (a) the nigrostriatal DA pathway that arises from the substantia nigra pars compacta and projects to the basal ganglia; (b) the mesolimbic pathway that arises from the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and projects to the limbic striatum (nucleus accumbens) and olfactory tubercle (Björklund and Lindvall, 1984); and (c) the mesocortical pathway that also arises from the VTA, but from a separate DA neuronal population. The mesocortical DA neurons project mainly to the cingulate, entorhinal and medial prefrontal cortices (PFC). These dopaminergic neurons functionally regulate higher motor execution of behavior, motivation and cognition. When impaired functionally, neurological and psychiatric disorders ensue (Egan and Weinberger, 1997; Lewis et al., 1998; Goldman-Rakic, 1998; Yang et al., 1999a).

Following the discovery of the mesocortical DA systems by Thierry and co-workers (Thierry et al., 1973; Berger et al., 1974), there was an explosive amount of functional data on neuromodulatory roles of DA in the PFC both in vitro and in vivo. However, the reported findings were collected under diverse experimental conditions, thus generating controversial findings and inviting opposing interpretations between groups of investigators. It is now generally accepted that DA is not a classical, fast ionotropic neurotransmitter like acetylcholine (nicotinic), glutamate (AMPA or NMDA) or GABA (GABAA), and DA is known to have differential actions on CNS neurons (Yang et al., 1999a; Durstewitz et al., 2000a, 2000b; Grace, 2002). This has created an enormously challenging task to sort out some general principles of DA actions in the PFC. Here, we attempt to present our views based on a critical evaluation of published, as well as unpublished, reports of DA's actions. We will focus on the key actions of DA in the PFC, but draw on the rich source of data on DA actions from other brain regions, particularly the striatum, to illustrate key points.

## 2. DA receptors in the PFC

All the DA receptors cloned so far are G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that typically possess seven transmembrane domains. Unlike the fast ionotropic receptors (e.g. ionotropic glutamate receptors such as AMPA and NMDA receptors), all GPCRs are essentially slow, metabotropic receptors that functionally modulate other receptor systems and/or ion channels (Lachowicz and Sibley, 1997; Missale et al., 1998; see Fig. 1). Hence, with a few exceptions, in the forebrain, activation of DA receptors per se does not induce large postsynaptic currents that can be measured electrophysiologically (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Fig. 1).

Once released from presynaptic axonal terminals, DA interacts with at least five receptor subtypes in the CNS: D1, D2, D3, D4, D5 receptors. Based on G-protein coupling, the length of the third cytoplasmic loop and the carboxy tail of the receptors, the cloned DA receptors are subdivided into the Gs-, Gq- or GoIf-coupled D1 family (D1, D5 receptors with longer third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl tail) and Gi/o D2 family (D2, D3, D4 receptors with shorter third cytoplasmic loop and carboxyl tail) (see Jackson and

Fig. 1. A schematic summary to indicate the complex interactive paths of DA receptors and their actions on voltage-dependent ion channels and ionotropic glutamate and GABA receptors that ultimately mediate changes in neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity in PFC neurons. DA stimulation of D1/5 receptor activates cAMP or IP3 second messenger pathways, which, in turn, lead to a cascade of intracellular signaling involving protein kinase A and C (PKA and PKC), phosphorylation of DA receptor phosphoprotein-32 kDa (DARPP32) and inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1); activation of calcium calmodulin kinase II and IV (CaMKII and CaMKIV), activation of nuclear transcription factor cAMP dependent response element binding protein (CREB), transcription of immediate early genes (IEG) and late response genes (LRG) that encode relevant membrane proteins and enzymes necessary to mediate long-term changes in intrinsic plasticity (changes in properties of ionic channels on dendrites that regulate neuronal excitability) and ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptor mediated changes in synaptic plasticity. DA activation of D2 class (e.g. D4) receptors suppresses cAMP synthesis and the receptor can also transactivate a platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to initiate intracellular Ca²⁺ release, which then stimulates calmodulin (CaM) to inactivate NMDA receptors. D4 receptor activation can also suppress PKA, PP1 to reduce CaMKII regulation of NMDA receptors.

Westlind-Danielsson, 1994; Lachowicz and Sibley, 1997; Missale et al., 1998; Zhuang et al., 2000; Jin et al., 2001; Kimura et al., 1995; Lezcano et al., 2000; Sidhu and Kimura, 1997).

In rodent and monkey PFC, the distribution of both D1 receptor mRNA and D1 receptor binding sites are significantly greater in amount when compared with the other DA receptor subtypes and may thus reflect its functional importance (Lidow et al., 1991; Goldman-Rakic et al., 1992; Farde et al., 1987; Gaspar et al., 1995). Anatomically, DA-immunoreactive terminals converge on pyramidal and parvalbumin-containing, DA-receptive fast-spiking interneurons in the primate PFC (Goldman-Rakic et al., 1989; Vérney et al., 1990; Sesack et al., 1995, 1998b; Gorelova et al., 2002). In rodent PFC, both D1- and D2-like receptors are found on pyramidal and non-pyramidal neurons (Vincent et al., 1993; Benes and Berretta, 2001). D1 receptors are located primarily on the dendritic spines and shafts of pyramidal neurons and on the dendrites and axon terminals of putative GABAergic interneurons in the primate PFC (Bergson et al., 1995a, 1995b; Muly III et al., 1998). DA may therefore exert both direct and indirect effects on the excitability of PFC pyramidal neurons (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Gorelova et al., 2002; Gao and Goldman-Rakic, 2003b).

Human D1 and D5 receptors share an 80% homology in the transmembrane domains that define the ligand-binding site, and the human and rat cloned D1 receptors show 91% homology. Pharmacologically, DA seems to bind with a 5–10-fold higher affinity to the D5 receptor (Sunahara et al., 1991; Grandy et al., 1991). Other than using knock-out mice or antisense strategies (Sibley, 1999; Waddington et al., 2001; Holmes et al., 2001; Hollon et al., 2002), there has been no pharmacological tools currently available that can clearly distinguish D1 from D5 receptors to allow functional dissection of the physiological contributions of these two DA receptor subtypes. Therefore, observed pharmacological effects of D1 agonist are likely to be D1/5 receptor mediated.

### 3. The functional roles of PFC DA in higher cognitive functions

The PFC subserves a variety of functions. Perhaps, the best-studied aspect is its role in working memory. The term working memory has its origins in the work of cognitive and comparative psychologists such as Badeley (1986), Honig (1978) and Olton et al. (1979). While there is a short-term memory component to working memory, these concepts are completely dissociable at the level of the PFC. It must be emphasized that PFC lesions do not affect short-term memory (e.g. see Petrides, 1989; Manes et al., 2002). Rather, the PFC manipulates items in short-term memory to plan, organize, and manipulate information required to generate future thought or action. The PFC has been said to bridge temporal gaps in the perception action cycle (Fuster, 1990),

allowing the organism to plan action based on memory. In this way, the role of the PFC in working memory could be described as “working with memory” (Winocur, 1992; Seamans, 2004).

Working memory in animals has been studied with variants of the delayed-response task, whereby a stimulus is presented then removed during a delay period. The animal must then remember the previous stimulus or its location in order to guide later responding. Thirty years ago, it was found that cells in the PFC remain active during this delay period or prior to the initiation of the response (Fuster, 1973). This type of activity likely reflects the online manipulation of items in active memory (Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Fuster, 1990; Robbins, 2000). The output of the PFC would then be from the resultant activities of the delay-active and response-active neurons that ultimately generate a forthcoming response based on memory. Furthermore, using selective regional PFC DA depletion by 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHDA) the pioneering work of Brozoski et al. (1979) in primate and Simon et al. (1980) in rats have pointed to the importance of mesocortical DA inputs in working memory and higher cognition (Le Moal and Simon, 1991).

#### 3.1. Endogenous DA release in PFC during working memory

With respect to working memory paradigms, primate PFC DA levels rise at the beginning of the task and stay elevated across many trials (Watanabe et al., 1997). In the rat, a working memory task was used that had longer acquisition, retention and test periods, allowing for an analysis of DA levels during each phase (Fig. 2; Ahn and Phillips, 1999; Phillips et al., 2004). This task was similar to the primate oculomotor delayed-response task in that eight possible stimuli were encoded, however it involved rats retrieving four food items from four of eight open and baited arms during an initial training phase and using this information 30 min later to predict the location of the remaining four of eight arms that contained a food item. In this task, DA levels in PFC were elevated during the training phase and stay elevated for a few or many minutes into the delay period before falling to baseline. DA levels in the PFC began to rise again in the test phase and stayed elevated for minutes after. These data suggest that the PFC DA signal is present during the encoding and use of working memory information by PFC circuits, but not its retention. This conclusion is consistent with the role of the PFC in “working with memory” or the ability to use, rather than store, mnemonic information. Note that from Fig. 2 that DA levels in PFC were similar regardless of whether food was present on the maze during the retrieval or test phase of the task. The pattern of release therefore suggests that extrasynaptic DA levels are not related to the presence or absence of a predicted rewards but rather the demands of the task at hand.

## 3.2. Pharmacological manipulation of PFC DA receptors in working memory

DA strongly modulates both working memory performance and task-dependent neuronal activity within the PFC. 6-Hydroxydopamine lesions or local injection of D1, but generally not D2 antagonists disrupt performance on delayed-response tasks (Brozoski et al., 1979; Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991, 1994; Seamans et al., 1998). Paradoxically, pharmacologically-induced high rates of DA turnover in the PFC also produce deficits in delayed tasks (Murphy et al., 1996) as do focal PFC injections of higher concentrations of D1 agonists or strong PKA activation (Zahrt et al., 1997; Floresco and Phillips, 2001; Aujla and Beninger, 2001; Taylor et al., 1999).

In an extensive series of studies summarized in Table 1 using simultaneous extracellular single-unit recording and microiontophoresis of DA (at 20–50 nA) on to single PFC neurons, Sawaguchi and colleagues have demonstrated that DA increased ‘delay-period’ activity of primate PFC neurons when the animal is performing a delayed-response task. This increase in ‘delay-period’ activity of PFC neurons was often quite large, up to 200% over the pre-drug levels, while background activity was increased by only ~30%. Moreover, this effect of DA appeared to be mediated by D1 receptors as it was mimicked by a non-selective D1 agonist, while iontophoresis of a D1 antagonist (>50 nA) had the opposite effect. Upon further analysis, blockade of D1 receptors reduced the selectivity of the PFC units to their preferred memory field, suggesting that D1 receptors tune the selectivity of working memory representations.

In contrast, Williams and Goldman-Rakic (1995) observed that iontophoresis of D1 antagonists at <50 nA of ejection current actually increased delay-period activity in the same manner, while ejection using larger currents suppressed delay-period activity (Table 1). The implication here is that under certain conditions the amount of D1 receptor stimulation may be too high, as a result of increased endogenous DA release due to stress, and moderate D1 receptor inhibition may actually prove beneficial. These data have been interpreted to suggest that an optimal level of D1 receptor ‘tone’ in the PFC is required for adequate working memory performance (Fig. 3). This hypothesis has been extended and supported in a series of studies by Arnsten’s group and others (Arnsten, 1997; Zahrt et al., 1997; Cai and Arnsten, 1997; Granon et al., 2000; Lidow et al., 2003) in both rats and primates. They showed that depending on the amount of D1 agonist stimulation they receive, D1 receptor activation could have the exact opposite effects (i.e. improving versus disrupting delay-period activity). Furthermore, if DA levels and D1 receptor activation is low, increasing D1 receptor stimulation may also prove beneficial (Fig. 3).

In an elegant test of these hypotheses, Floresco and Phillips (2001) manipulated D1 receptor stimulation via

From the table, all studies showed DA iontophoresis increased both background and task related activity but the increase in task-related activity was greater. D1 antagonists at high ejection currents always reduced delay-period activity. Even though this type of iontophoresis is thought to produce a tiny localized drug concentration in the pmol range, lowering the ejection current enhanced delay-period activity in one study while attenuating the reduction in firing in another. D2 antagonists had no effect in all studies but one which showed that they decreased firing generally.

30 min delay impaired performance, whereas the same injection delivered after up to a 12 h delay actually improved test phase performance.

These findings demonstrated that in well-trained rats DA levels and D1 receptor stimulation are optimized such that increases or decreases in D1 receptor stimulation disrupt performance. PFC DA levels, and presumably D1 receptor stimulation drop with performance as the delay period is prolonged, but the deteriorated performance can be partially overcome by increased D1 receptor ‘tone’. These data not only emphasize the importance of optimal D1 receptor ‘tone’, but also highlight the fact that the identical exogenous D1 receptor stimulation can have exactly opposite effects on behavior, depending on which phase of memory is activated during D1 receptor stimulation.

While much of the current focus is on the functional roles of mesocortical DA in short-term working memory mechanisms, the functional roles of DA (as well as other monoamines) in distinct phases of memory (namely, acquisition → retention → retrieval) have been studied recently (Bernabeu et al., 1997; Abel and Lattal, 2001; Izquierdo and Medina, 1997; Seamans et al., 1998; Floresco and Phillips, 2001). Injection of drugs at different time points to disrupt or enhance memory during a training phase, before, or after a delay period but prior to testing the animal, enables one to probe the working memory acquisition, retention, and retrieval mechanisms, respectively. Since the levels of endogenous PFC DA in these three distinct phases of memory may also be different, there is a critical need to account for the predisposed conditions where an exogenous D1 agonist is administered before a meaningful conclusion could be drawn. The example of the study by Floresco and Phillips (2001) demonstrates the importance of timing of D1 receptor activation in modulating these phases of memory encoding.

FEATURE #1: D1 receptor activation can have exactly opposing functional effects depending on the level of stimulation. There is an inverted-‘U’ (bell-shaped) function relating cognitive performance to D1 stimulation levels (Fig. 3).

---

Fig. 3. D1 receptor activation follows an inverted-‘U’-shape function in the case of delay-period activity on a working memory task. Too much or too little D1 agonist stimulation both disrupt performance (modified from Goldman-Rakic et al., 2000).

the PFC of well-trained rats caused them to visit arms in a random manner, suggesting that these rats were unable to direct responding to locations predicted by previously acquired information (Seamans et al., 1998). Random responding implies that each arm location was of equal importance, while perseveration implies that a greater weight was given to certain arm locations. Thus, D1 receptor activation in the PFC may regulate the ‘perceived’ significance of stimuli, and determine which type of internal representation guides responding, and how vigorously the responses should be. Within the PFC, stimuli strongly associated with the release of DA may lock in certain types of behaviors or responses. In contrast, lowering D1 activity may promote enhanced behavioral flexibility. In the following sections, we will provide an overview of the cellular mechanisms that underlie some of the neuromodulatory modes of action of DA that contribute to cognitive processing in PFC. Some of these ideas have also been formalized in computational models of PFC circuits (Durstewitz et al., 2000a, 2000b; Durstewitz and Seamans, 2002) and are described in Section 16.

4. DA is a neuromodulator: the electrophysiological perspective

The investigation into a possible neuromodulatory role of DA began in earnest in the late 1970s. Some of the key early in vitro and in vivo electrophysiological investigations of DA mechanisms in striatum and accumbens showed that exogenously applied DA (either by bath application in vitro or by microiontophoresis in vivo) moderately depolarized, and/or hyperpolarized, neurons usually by 5–7 mV (Herrling and Hull, 1980; Herrling, 1981; Bernardi et al., 1982; Uchimura et al., 1986). When spontaneous firing does occur in these neurons, the effects of exogenous DA on striatal and frontal cortical neurons
was generally suppressive (Bernardi et al., 1982; Herrling and Hull, 1980). With conventional extracellular single-unit recordings where firing changes due to drug application are reflected as an increase or decrease firing rate, investigators mainly reported the *suppressive* actions of exogenous DA. This has led many investigators to call DA an ‘inhibitory’ transmitter (Connor, 1970; Mantz et al., 1992; Thierry et al., 1998), although recent electrophysiological data suggest that DA is more appropriately defined as a neuromodulator (see further).

By definition, a modulator should induce little or no change in basal neuronal activity, but the modulator will potentiate or attenuate responses evoked by another transmitter substance (Barchas et al., 1978). Several research groups were examining possible modulatory effects of catecholamines, including DA, on neurotransmission by fast transmitters such as acetylcholine, glutamate and GABA (Bernardi et al., 1982; Yim and Mogenson, 1982; Yang and Mogenson, 1986; Vives and Mogenson, 1986; Oades, 1985; Waterhouse and Woodward, 1980; Woodward et al., 1991; Surmeier and Kitai, 1997; White, 1996; Waszcak and Walters, 1983; Cépeda and Levine, 1998). In the striatum or nucleus accumbens, the bulk of in vivo and in vitro studies showed that DA, either iontophoretically applied or synaptically released by stimulation of the VTA, suppressed synaptically evoked glutamatergic inputs (e.g. from the hippocampus or amygdala to the nucleus accumbens) or glutamate evoked excitation (Reader et al., 1979; Hirata et al., 1984; Vives and Mogenson, 1986; Yim and Mogenson, 1982; Yang and Mogenson, 1986; White and Wang, 1986). However, when iontophoretically co-applied with glutamate or GABA at very low iontophoretic doses, DA potentiated glutamate excitation in striatum, accumbens, nigra pars reticulata, and somatosensory cortex (Chiodo and Berger, 1986; Waszcak and Walters, 1983; White and Wang, 1986; Hu and White, 1997). Thus, from early on, it became apparent that the actions of DA were complex.

The application of in vitro brain slices or cultured DA neurons has provided another level of analysis of the detailed cellular mechanisms of DA modulation of ionic channels and synaptic responses. These include different modes of firing of DA neurons, which cause differential presynaptic release, a tonic physiological ‘tone’ of DA, distinct bell-shaped dose–response profile of postsynaptic DA effects, different postsynaptic responses that are contingent to duration of DA receptor stimulation, prolonged duration of DA actions, bidirectional effects following activation of D1 and D2 class of receptors and membrane potential state-dependence of DA actions. In this review, we attempt to bring together findings from multiple lines of investigation and examine critically the key mechanisms revealed in these studies. We try to build upon these important ideas to synthesize an acceptable, testable, and unified view on how DA functions as a unique neuromodulator in the PFC.

### 5. DA modulation of evoked spiking in PFC neurons in vitro

In order to understand these complex modulations of working memory processes by DA, we must understand how DA modulates the basic physiological properties of PFC neurons. This work has been progressing over the past decade yet controversies remain. Intracellular injection of depolarizing pulses (often in the presence of extracellular blockade of ionotropic glutamate and/or GABA receptors to prevent all fast neurotransmission) has been used to determine changes in neuronal excitability resulting from the effects of DA on intrinsic ion currents. The long-term changes in ion channels that conduct currents that regulate neuronal excitability has recently been proposed as a form of intrinsic plasticity (Zhang and Linden, 2003).

Penit-Soria et al. (1987) first reported that DA at high concentrations (400 μM) and in the presence of DA uptake blocker nomifensine increased neuronal excitability of PFC neurons recorded intracellularly in brain slices as assessed by depolarizing current pulse induced spike discharge. In contrast, Geijo-Barrientos and Pastore (1995) showed that DA suppressed firing of PFC neurons recorded by current-clamp intracellularly in vitro, while reducing an inward current evoked by depolarizing voltage steps in voltage-clamp. While the current was largely reduced by TTX in this study, it was not clear whether the effect of DA on inward rectification and spiking was due to an effect on a persistent sodium current (*I*~NaP~) or another current, since Ca^2+^ and K^+^ channel blockers were not used to isolate *I*~NaP~.

Consistent with the initial findings of Penit-Soria et al. (1987), Yang and Seamans (1996) showed that DA or D1 agonists, but not D2 agonists, enhanced depolarizing pulse induced spike firing of PFC neurons in vitro and prolonged the sustained TTX-sensitive plateau potential evoked in the presence of ion channels blockers for K^+^ and Ca^2+^ currents. Subsequently, a similar result was obtained by Gorelova and Yang (2000) who used whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques in the presence of Ca^2+^ and K^+^ channel blockers to show that the voltage-dependence of the TTX-sensitive and Na^+^ dependent inward current evoked by voltage ramps was shifted leftward by DA or D1 agonists, with no change in peak amplitude. These DA agents also reduced the inactivation time constant of the TTX-sensitive Na^+^ current. Taken together, these changes observed under voltage-clamp were proposed to underlie the DA and D1-mediated decrease in first spike latency and spike frequency adaptation observed under current-clamp. In the intervening years, a number of studies in both rat and primate PFC have confirmed that, at least under certain conditions, DA via D1 agonists increases the excitability of PFC neurons in vitro (Henze et al., 2000; Ceci et al., 1999; Wang and O’Donnell, 2001; Lavin and Grace; 2001; Shi et al., 1997) and in vivo (Nogueira et al., 2003). The remaining controversy about the effect
of DA on PFC excitability revolves around two main issues, its temporal profile and the ionic mechanisms involved.

### 5.1. Temporal profile of DA modulation of spiking

The earlier studies have shown that DA or its D1 agonist exert a prolonged change in neuronal excitability. In addition, Gulledge and Jaffe (1998, 2001) in a thorough series of investigations, showed that it was also possible to get both a decrease *and* increase in depolarizing pulse evoked firing of PFC neurons in vitro by a single brief application of DA. They observed that bath-applied DA initially reduced spike firing evoked by intracellular depolarizing pulses via D2 receptor activation. Gorelova and Yang (2000) later showed that the D2 mediated transient reduction in firing was likely to be mediated by an increase of a ‘leak’ current. Gulledge and Jaffe (1998, 2001) also showed that this suppressive action of DA subsided in the 10–15 min after DA application. This was immediately followed by a “rebound” increase in evoked spiking that typically lasted the duration of the experiment (>30 min). Such a biphasic response profile of DA on excitability was also observed by Gorelova and Yang (2000) and is often a feature of DA modulation, as discussed further. Hence, it is crucial to provide time-course data to show the effects of DA over time, instead of relying on a ‘snapshot’ of the DA effect at certain time point during the continuous course of the DA response.

---

FEATURE #2: There is a biphasic effect of DA in time after application, with DA producing an initial decrease in physiological measures followed by an increase. This effect may be a general feature of DA as it has been observed in striatal (Williams and Millar, 1990a), hippocampal (Gribkoff and Ashe, 1984) and PFC neurons (Gulledge and Jaffe, 1998, 2001; Gorelova and Yang, 2000; Seamans et al., 2001b). Biphasic actions of DA are also present in non-neuronal tissue (Calabrese, 2001).

---

DA also increases spontaneous sIPSCs (Zhou and Hablitz, 1999; Penit-Soria et al., 1987; Seamans et al., 2001b), while focal GABA application to the axon hillock area mimicked the suppressive effect of DA on spiking. Gulledge and Jaffe (2001) showed that in the continual presence of the GABA antagonist bicuculline, bath application of DA induced *only* an increase in depolarizing pulse induced spiking that far outlasted the application period. The conclusion from these studies was that DA interacted with GABAergic transmission to initially decrease evoked spiking in PFC neurons, and this effect briefly occluded a more prolonged evoked spike enhancing action of DA. Collectively, these data show that both indirect actions of DA on GABA systems and the time following DA application dictate the observed DA effect on neuronal excitability in PFC neurons (see section on DA modulation of inhibitory responses).

### 5.2. Ionic mechanisms that underlie DA modulation of neuronal excitability (intrinsic plasticity)

#### 5.2.1. Slowly inactivating/persistent Na⁺ current ($I_{NaP}$)

PFC neurons received excitatory synaptic inputs that evoke EPSPs subthreshold to spike firing. In addition to these glutamatergic EPSPs that can be modulated by DA, several interacting voltage-dependent ionic currents (e.g. persistent Na⁺ current, several persistent K⁺ currents, low threshold Ca²⁺ current; Yang et al., 1996a, 1996b; Gorelova and Yang, 2000; de la Pena and Geijo-Barrientos, 1996; Dong and White, 2003; Hammond and Crépel, 1992) are also active in this subthreshold membrane voltage 10–30 mV more positive than resting membrane potentials (summarized and reviewed in Yang et al., 1996a, 1996b, 1999a). These currents interact with each other to regulate spike threshold, as well as the duration and amplitude of EPSPs.

As noted above, studies investigating the effect of DA directly on major ionic currents that underly spike initiation, such as the $I_{\text{NaP}}$, have provided conflicting results. A voltage-ramp activated slow inward TTX-sensitive current, in the absence of any ion channel blockers for Ca²⁺ and K⁺ currents, was recorded from rat PFC neurons in slices using single-electrode voltage-clamp employing sharp intracellular electrodes. This current was suppressed by DA (Geijo-Barrientos and Pastore, 1995). Two other studies reported that DA produced no modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in cortical neurons. Cépeda et al. (1995) examined the effect on the inward current evoked by depolarizing voltage ramps in neurons from slices of the cortex obtained from children following surgery for epilepsy. No difference in the amplitude of the inward current were observed, yet the outward current evoked at more depolarized voltages was greatly reduced. No blockers of ion channels were employed in either of these studies.

When $I_{\text{NaP}}$ was pharmacologically isolated with Ca²⁺ and K⁺ channel blockers, Gorelova and Yang (2000) also observed no change in $I_{\text{NaP}}$ amplitude with D1 receptor stimulation. However, it is notable that even though the peak amplitude of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ was largely unaffected by DA, the current-voltage relationship was shifted such that at potentials more positive than –40 mV there was an increase in $I_{\text{NaP}}$ amplitude, whereas at potentials more negative than –40 mV, the $I_{\text{NaP}}$ current was smaller. In other words, DA does not change the total $I_{\text{NaP}}$ current peak amplitude, but has more impact on $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in the subthreshold voltage range, thus resulting in lowering of the threshold for Na⁺ spikes and ultimately an increase in spike firing. This voltage-dependent effect was aided by a parallel reduction in a ‘leak’ conductance not blocked by internal Cs⁺ (Gorelova and Yang, 2000). Thus, studies conducted in intact PFC neurons in an acute slice

preparation are not necessarily contradictory with regards to DA modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$.

Unlike in the fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current in dissociated striatal and hippocampal neuron preparations where D1 receptor activation resulted in a PKA-dependent suppression (Stanzione et al., 1984; Catterall, 1999; Cantrell et al., 1997, 1999), the D1 effect on $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in intact PFC neurons from brain slices was mediated by protein kinase C (Gorelova and Yang, 2000). This is consistent with data showing that activation of PKC alone, unlike PKA, shifts the voltage activation of the $I_{\text{NaP}}$ to more negative potentials in cortical neurons (Astman et al., 1998; Franceschetti et al., 2000). The D1 receptor is not typically coupled to PKC activation and intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ mobilization. However, recently, a D1 receptor interaction protein Calcyon has been discovered that can couple the D1 receptor to the phospholipase C pathway to activate PKC (Bergson et al., 2003; Lezcano and Bergson, 2002; Jin et al., 2001). The D1-Calcyon coupling requires ‘priming’ through mechanisms that elevate intracellular $[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}]$. Evoked spiking undoubtedly will increase activity-dependent $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ influx to ‘prime’ D1-Calcyon coupling. The discovery of this novel intracellular mechanism may account for a D1/Gq/PKC activation to potentiate $I_{\text{NaP}}$ actions in PFC neurons. It should be noted that direct effects of D1-PKA and PKC on other ionic currents also contribute to the prolonged change in neuronal excitability in PFC neurons (see further sections). Thus differential signaling pathways may be responsible for the different results of D1 modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in dissociated striatal and hippocampal neurons versus cortical neurons in brain slices.

In contrast to these effects, Gulledge and Stuart (2003) recently reported that DA had no effect on the back-propagating action potential waveform, recorded via dendritic patch-clamp electrodes or via $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ imaging. Since they observed that DA affected intrasomatically depolarizing pulse evoked spike number, it is likely that DA modulated ionic currents that are involved in determining neuronal excitability, but not the currents that determine the actual action potential waveform. This study is therefore more consistent with a DA-mediated modulation of slow currents that affect excitability, like $I_{\text{NaP}}$, rather than fast currents, like the fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current, that determine the action potential waveform.

Technical constraints from brain slice versus isolated neuron preparation may also contribute to different results. Clearly, one problem with the slice studies of Gorelova and Yang (2000) is that recordings were performed in large pyramidal neurons where it is impossible to adequately control the voltage of a significant portion of the neuron. In computer simulations of these types of neurons differences in voltage from a voltage-clamped soma to a distal unclamped dendrite produce a flow of current, that can appear similar to a persistent current (White et al., 1995). While this would occur in a passive neurite, the problem becomes especially acute if active currents in unclamped regions of the neuron augment potential differences in

voltage and hence promote the flow of current. Therefore, it might be argued that the DA-mediated modulation of “$I_{\text{NaP}}$” in intact neurons is actually due to a DA-mediated modulation of another current that would boost the voltage difference between compartments. Although some previous studies examining DA modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ have used agents to block $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Gorelova and Yang, 2000), it is still not certain that all non-$\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ currents were blocked, given their diversity e.g. a internal $\mathrm{Cs}^{+}$-insensitive ‘leak’ conductance (Gorelova and Yang, 2000).

In an attempt to address this issue Maurice et al. (2001) examined the modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in acutely dissociated deep layer PFC neurons at room temperature. This acute dissociation procedure involves enzymatic and mechanical removal of neurites, leaving a soma that emanates one or a few short dendritic processes. The advantage of such a cell preparation is that good voltage control can be achieved under voltage-clamp due to the limited spatial extent of the neuron. Voltage control is increased if lowered concentrations of ions are used such that currents are smaller in amplitude and can be prevented from generating a positive feedback situation and voltage escape. In these dissociated cells in the presence of low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and external TEA and $\mathrm{Cd}^{2+}$ to block TEA-sensitive $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ currents and all $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ currents, plus internal TEA and CsCl to block additional $\mathrm{K}$ currents, Maurice et al. (2001) found that DA or a D1 agonist decreased the fast $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current without affecting $I_{\text{NaP}}$. When external $[\mathrm{NaCl}]$ was increased, the whole-cell $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current increased and greater voltage escape occurred. Under these conditions, modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ by DA was similar to that reported in Gorelova and Yang (2000) (Surmeirer, personal communication). On one hand, this would suggest that voltage-clamp errors did hamper previous attempts to measure $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in intact neurons. On the other hand, the acute cell dissociation process may interfere or destroy critical regions or membrane components of the neuron that were required for the D1-mediated effects. Hence, the nature of DA modulation of $I_{\text{NaP}}$ in PFC neurons awaits replication and further clarification.

### 5.2.2. Slowly inactivating $K^{+}$ current

Another major current that operates in the membrane voltage range just subthreshold to spike firing is a 4-aminopyridine- and dendrotoxin-sensitive slowly inactivating $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ conductance ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$) (Storm, 1988; Hammond and Crépel, 1992; Yang and Seamans, 1996; Dong and White, 2003). This slow outward $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current mediates membrane outward rectification in the depolarized voltage range and functionally opposes the sustained membrane depolarization mediated by the slow $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ current ($I_{\text{NaP}}$) to regulate firing threshold of PFC neurons (Yang et al., 1996a, 1996b; Yang and Seamans, 1996).

When both $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels are blocked, D1/5 agonists can remove a membrane outward rectification mediated by this slowly inactivated $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ current ($I_{\mathrm{D}}$) and this

enables the persistent Na⁺ current (Iₙₐₚ) to exert its primary effect to lower the threshold for spike firing (Yang and Seamans, 1996). In dissociated striatal neurons, D1 receptor stimulation has been shown to directly interact with the K⁺ channels that flux Iₔ (Nisenbaum et al., 1998), but in dissociated PFC neurons, Dong and White (2003) have recently shown that the suppression of Iₔ by the D1 receptor is mediated intracellularly via a D1–camp–PKA pathway. The consequence of these events is that once spike threshold is lowered by DA, the ensuing repetitive firing would be sustained (Kitai and Surmeier, 1993; Yang and Seamans, 1996).

suggests that direct dopaminergic modulation of these Ca²⁺ channels (perhaps after D1 suppression of K⁺ currents, Dong and White, 2003) could have a profound influence on the input-output relationship of PFC neurons (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Yang et al., 1999a).

### 5.2.4. Differences in apical dendritic Ca²⁺ electrogenesis in neurons from PFC versus somatosensory cortex

Ca²⁺ electrogenesis appears to be different in the distal apical dendrites of layer V PFC neurons, versus the more extensively studied apical dendrites of layer V neurons from somatosensory cortex: The distal apical dendrites of PFC neurons appear to possess little Ca²⁺ electrogenesis. Using “blind” recordings from the apical tuft of layer V PFC neurons we observed clear Na⁺ spikes, but found it difficult to evoke clear Ca²⁺ potentials in the absence of Na⁺ currents (Seamans et al., 1997). This observation in PFC apical dendrites has been confirmed recently by Gulledge and Stuart (2003) who showed that back-propagating action potentials evoked little Ca²⁺ electrogenesis recorded via patch-pipettes or Ca²⁺ imaging in distal PFC dendrites. In contrast, large amplitude and duration Ca²⁺ spikes are readily observed in the distal apical dendrites of adult somatosensory neurons (Schiller et al., 1997; Stuart et al., 1997; Larkum et al., 1999a; Zhu, 2000; Larkum and Zhu, 2002).

The differences between the two types of cortical pyramidal cell dendrites may reflect a key difference in the anatomy of the rat medial PFC versus somatosensory cortex. The rat medial PFC lacks a clear layer IV and as a result the apical dendrite ascending from layer V to layer I is shorter in PFC than that in somatosensory cortical dendrites. Zhu (2000) showed that layer V somatosensory pyramidal neurons from young animals are smaller and possess shorter apical dendrites. Their soma and apical tufts are strongly electrotonically coupled and dendritic spiking almost exclusively reflects axosomatic back-propagating Na⁺ spiking. In contrast, with age the somasensory cortex grows and the apical dendrite of layer V neurons become longer, causing the apical tuft to be progressively uncoupled from the soma. Possibly along with changes in active channel properties of adult neurons, this uncoupling allows the tuft to behave as an electrotonically isolated compartment, now capable of generating Ca²⁺ spikes in isolation from the soma. Given the smaller layer V to layer I distance in the PFC, this kind of soma-dendritic uncoupling is likely never achieved and as a result, PFC neurons behave in a manner similar to somatosensory neurons from young animals in that dendritic spiking is dominated by back-propagated axosomatic Na⁺ dependent action potentials.

Potassium channels distributed along the apical dendrites of cortical and hippocampal neurons exert powerful control over other voltage-activated ion channels (Schwindt and Crill, 1997; Oakley et al., 2001a, 2001b; Seamans et al., 1997; Bekkers, 2000; Johnston et al., 2000). If K⁺ channels are not blocked, there is little Ca²⁺ electrogenesis that can be recorded in the proximal apical dendrites of layer V PFC

### 5.2.3. Dendritic low- and high-threshold Ca²⁺ currents

Another potential mechanism through which DA could change neuronal excitability is via modulation of Ca²⁺ currents. Based on the morphological profile of dendritic arborizations, pyramidal neurons in the PFC possess at least two dendritic compartments: apical and basal. The main branch of apical dendrites in deep layer V–VI pyramidal PFC neurons can extend up to 900 μM towards superficial layer I–II in the pia where numerous transcortical, callosal inputs converge (reviewed in Yang et al., 1999a). Direct dendritic recordings have shown that active ionic conductances (Na⁺, K⁺, Ca²⁺) are all present in the dendrites and the biophysical properties of apical dendrites in PFC, somatosensory cortex, and hippocampus have been reviewed extensively (Yuste and Tank, 1996; Yang et al., 1999a; Seamans et al., 1997; Johnston et al., 1996; Migliore and Shepherd, 2002; Häusser et al., 2000). On the other hand, basal dendrites emanating from the soma of pyramidal neurons are much less well characterized electrophysiologically but are also a site of activity-dependent Ca²⁺ influx (Schiller et al., 2000; Oakley et al., 2001a, 2001b; Young and Yang, 2004).

Several subtypes of Ca²⁺ channels are present throughout these apical and basal dendrites (Magee and Johnston, 1995; Kavalali et al., 1997a). They are functionally implicated not only in regulating spiking, but also synaptic signal amplification and Ca²⁺-dependent synaptic plasticity (Johnston et al., 1996; Magee and Johnston, 1997; Markram et al., 1997). Very distal apical dendritic Ca²⁺ potentials in adult somatosensory cortex, but not PFC, can be readily evoked by strong direct depolarizing pulses, strong depolarizing synaptic inputs, as well as back-propagating Na⁺ spikes (Stuart et al., 1997; Larkum et al., 1999a, 1999b, 2001; Larkum and Zhu, 2002; Helmchen et al., 1999). However, in vitro findings based on direct apical dendritic injection of simulated EPSPs in PFC neurons suggest that unless K⁺ currents are suppressed, distal apical dendritic Ca²⁺ potentials play a secondary role to amplification by TTX-sensitive persistent Na⁺ currents (Gonzalez-Burgos and Barriaonuevo, 2001). Nonetheless, the close proximity of mesocortical DA terminals onto these dendritic spines in the apical and basal dendrites (Krimer et al., 1997; Goldman-Rakic et al., 1989)
neurons (Gonzalez-Burgos and Barriónuevo, 2001; Gulledge and Stuart, 2003; Seamans et al., 1997). Using Cs⁺-containing patch-pipettes (to block K⁺ channels) Seamans et al. (1997) showed that layer I–II stimulation evoked NMDA EPSPs in layer V PFC neurons were able to trigger a subthreshold Ca²⁺ ‘hump’ potential electrotonically close to the soma, reminiscent to the subthreshold Ca²⁺ current found in hippocampal pyramidal neurons (Magee et al., 1996). Under moderate K⁺ channel blockade, Ca²⁺ ‘hump’ potentials could also be evoked by intracellular depolarizing current pulses. Subsequently, Schiller et al. (2000) showed that a similar looking ‘hump’ potential could be recorded at the soma of somatosensory neurons by NMDA activation of the basal dendrites, even in the presence of a Ca²⁺ channel blocker. Although these authors suggested that this potential was an NMDA spike generated in the basal dendrites in somatosensory neurons, Antic et al. (2003) reported that similar potentials were mediated by a mix of NMDA/Ca²⁺ currents in the basal dendrites of PFC neurons. Collectively, it appears that layer V PFC neurons in the adult possess apical dendrites that are electrically similar to juvenile somatosensory pyramidal neurons, in that distal electrogenesis is Na⁺ rather than Ca²⁺ mediated. Moreover, Ca²⁺ electrogenesis is likely the result of NMDA/Ca²⁺ spikes generated in basal dendrites, rather than the proximal apical dendrite, as initially proposed (Seamans et al., 1997).

### 5.2.5. DA D1 receptor modulates state-dependent switching of dendritic Ca²⁺ potentials via PKA and PKC activation

DA has been shown to modulate high voltage-activated Ca²⁺ currents in several types of vertebrate and invertebrate neurons in vitro (Paupardin-Tritsch et al., 1985; Marchetti et al., 1986; Williams et al., 2000; Surmeier et al., 1995; Hernández-López et al., 1997). In primate PFC, D1 receptors are primarily found in the dendritic shafts and spines, in close proximity to the known locations of dendritic Ca²⁺ channels (Smiley et al., 1994). In rat layer V–VI PFC pyramids, following blockade of Na⁺ and K⁺ channels, multiphasic high voltage-activated Ca²⁺ potentials are evoked by strong suprathreshold intracellular depolarizing pulses. These potentials are generated close to the soma-basal dendrite compartment since a large hyperpolarizing pulse can abruptly terminate these potentials (Young and Yang, 2004). The dendritic Ca²⁺ potentials consist of both the ‘hump’ potential (>50 ms), and plateau (>100 ms) depolarizations (Seamans et al., 1997). Such multi-phasic dendritic Ca²⁺ potentials may reflect multiple soma-distal dendritic sites of electrogenesis (Reuveni et al., 1993).

Recently, we have investigated the complex modulation of Ca²⁺ potentials in PFC neurons by DA. Direct D1/5 receptor stimulation (by SKF38393, SKF81297, dihydrexidine or A77636) induced state-dependent modulation of the Ca²⁺ potentials. First, for full Ca²⁺ spikes triggered by strong suprathreshold intracellular current pulses, D1/5 agonists suppressed their amplitude (Yang and Seamans, 1996). The suppressive effects of D1/5 agonists were prevented by chelating intracellular Ca²⁺ and by PKC inhibitors (Young and Yang, 2004). Secondly, when activated by smaller depolarizing current pulses subthreshold for full Ca²⁺ spikes, a nimodipine-sensitive dendritic Ca²⁺ ‘hump’ potential was generated close to the soma (Seamans et al., 1997), most likely in the basal dendrites, as discussed earlier. In contrast to full Ca²⁺ spikes, this ‘hump’ potential is augmented transiently (~7 min) by D1/5 receptor agonists (Yang et al., 1998; Young and Yang, 2004) and this interaction is blocked by PKA inhibitors. Furthermore, in the presence of intracellular PKC inhibitors, the subthreshold ‘hump’ potential is switched by a D1 agonist to full Ca²⁺ spike bursts. Thus, D1 stimulation activates PKA to potentiate a subthreshold L-type Ca²⁺ ‘hump’ potential, leading to L-type Ca²⁺ spike firing, which can then be terminated by a secondary D1-activated Ca²⁺ dependent PKC suppression of L-type Ca²⁺ channels over time. In this way, soma-dendritic populations of L-type Ca²⁺ channels can be modulated spatially and temporally by a depolarizing state-dependent D1R modulation of PKA-PKC pathways.

---

FEATURE #3: DA acting through the same receptor can produce bidirectional modulation via different intracellular cascades. DA provides a state-dependent dynamic bidirectional switching of dendritic Ca²⁺ potentials via PKA and PKC.

---

A recent study by Gulledge and Stuart (2003) failed to find that DA (10–100 μM) suppressed the imaged dendritic Ca²⁺ signal triggered by single or multiple back-propagated spikes (no D1 agonist was tested in that study). This study differed from Young and Yang (2004) in that it focused on DA-mediated changes in Ca²⁺ signaling produced by an action potential waveform. Action potential waveforms produce a large but extremely transient change in voltage, compared to a 50–100 ms somatic current pulse. As noted earlier, DA appears to exert little effect on the Ca²⁺ influx in the apical dendrites induced by back-propagated action potential waveform (Gulledge and Stuart, 2003), yet strongly modulates the longer duration Ca²⁺ currents that are evoked by glutamate-induced mixed NMDA/Ca²⁺ potentials (Radojicic et al., 2003), or by intrasomatic depolarizing current pulses (50 ms) near the soma-basal dendrites (Young and Yang, 2004).

### 5.2.6. Intracellular signaling cascades and Ca²⁺ potential modulation by DA

The augmentation of subthreshold Ca²⁺ ‘hump’ potentials via PKA activation is consistent with the findings in striatal (Galarraga et al., 1997; Hernández-López et al., 1997) and retinal horizontal cells (Pfeiffer-Linn and Lasater,1996). Dihydropyridine-sensitive L-type Ca²⁺ channels can be activated at relatively hyperpolarized potentials (−50 mV) via long voltage pulses (Magee and Johnston, 1995; Avery and Johnston, 1996; Schjött and Plummer, 2000). These channels are likely of the alpha 1D, L-type channels that are clustered around the soma of pyramidal neurons (Westenbroek et al., 1992). Single channel recordings in hippocampal neurons and bovine chromaffin cells have shown that cAMP analogue, or DA and its D1/5 agonist, increase the availability of L-type channels. This process is attributed to a recruitment of previously ‘silent’ L-type Ca²⁺ channels so that there is a reopening of these channels particularly during repolarization from a moderate depolarization (Artalejo et al., 1990; Kavalali et al., 1997b). This mechanism may be responsible for the enhancement of the duration of high voltage activated dendritic Ca²⁺ currents by D1/5 receptor activation leading to increased spiking (Young and Yang, 2004).

The modulation of subthreshold Ca²⁺ potentials by DA may also increase excitability of PFC neurons to NMDA application (Cépeda et al., 1998; Galarraga et al., 1997; Hernández-López et al., 1997; Lavin and Grace, 2001; Wang and O'Donnell, 2001). Since L-type Ca²⁺ channels and NMDA receptors enable a large influx of cationic current at depolarized potentials, the modulation of these currents by DA may allow PFC neurons to be more responsive to excitatory inputs when they are in a depolarized state and also provide the appropriately large [Ca²⁺]i for LTP to occur. By concurrently regulating the amplitude and duration of Ca²⁺ spikes by the state-dependent D1 switching of ‘hump’ to spike to and back to ‘hump’, DA may spatially augment or restrict Ca²⁺-dependent events in the dendrites to ‘fine-tune’ the effects of synaptic responses in order to “boost”, “focus” or “sharpen” the signal for integration by the soma (Yang and Seamans, 1996). If this reduction were sufficiently robust, it is likely that only very strong suprathreshold synaptic inputs would be transmitted to the soma for optimal output, as previously proposed (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Yang et al., 1999a).

When viewed collectively it is apparent that DA can modulate a number of key currents that regulate the activity of PFC neurons. There is an emerging consensus that DA via D1 receptors enhances spiking in PFC neurons in vitro via modulation of Na⁺, K⁺ and/or Ca²⁺ currents that have overlapping activation ranges near threshold voltage.

### 6. DA modulation of synaptic transmission

#### 6.1. Modulation of excitatory synaptic responses (Table 2)

The spines on the apical dendrites of pyramidal and striatal neurons provide key anatomical sites for the interaction of glutamatergic and dopaminergic inputs. DA D1 receptors are distributed in very close proximity to ionotropic glutamate receptors (NMDA and AMPA) at asymmetric synapses in dendrites (Vérney et al., 1990; Goldman-Rakic, 1996; Sesack et al., 1998b).

In striatal neurons, reports of DA modulation of mixed glutamate receptor mediated synaptic responses are contradictory. In dorsal striatal neurons, DA depresses (Umemiya and Raymond, 1997) or has no effect (Nicola and Malenka, 1998) on compound postsynaptic potentials. However, in other striatal studies, the non-NMDA response was shown to be augmented by activation of either DA or PKA (PKA) (Colwell and Levine, 1995; Umemiya and Raymond, 1997; Levine and Cépeda, 1998). In cultured striatal neurons the D1 agonist potentiation of AMPA currents was mediated via PKA phosphorylation of the AMPA receptor (specifically Ser-845 of GluR1) (Price et al., 1999; Snyder et al., 2000; Chao et al., 2002a, 2002b) that could then promote mobilization of AMPA receptors from cytosolic sites to the membrane surfaces (Chao et al., 2002a, 2002b). In addition, the D1/PKA/DARPP32 cascade can also inhibit PP1 to prevent AMPA receptor mediated current ‘run-down’ (Yan et al., 1999; Lin et al., 2003). All these mechanisms could account for D1 receptor potentiation of postsynaptic AMPA receptor functions in striatum.

In rodent cortex, DA or a D1 agonist decreases evoked non-NMDA EPSP/Cs, without altering the postsynaptic inward AMPA current induced by focal application of AMPA (in the presence of TTX to block presynaptic transmission) (Law-Tho et al., 1994; Gao et al., 2001; Seamans et al., 2001a; Zheng et al., 1999; Behr et al., 2000). This suggests that the D1-mediated reduction of non-NMDA EPSP/Cs occurred presynaptically in PFC and entorhinal cortex. Accordingly, unitary EPSCs (in TTX), and the paired-pulse ratio evoked by single axon inputs between layer III PFC pyramidal cell-pairs were reduced by focally applied DA and D1 agonists in ferret PFC slices (Gao et al., 2001; Gao and Goldman-Rakic, 2003a). However, this effect on paired-cell EPSPs may be species specific because in primate dorsolateral PFC slices Urban et al. (2002) found no such reduction in paired-cell recordings from layer III PFC neurons. Nonetheless, Urban et al. (2002) found that that EPSCs evoked by a stimulating electrode were reduced by DA via D1, and possibly D2 receptors. In rat PFC neurons, D1 agonists also reduced the evoked EPSC, mEPSC frequency and slowed the synaptic activity-dependent MK801 blocking function (Seamans et al., 2001a), again suggesting that activation of presynaptic D1 sites on glutamate axonal terminals in the PFC of primates and rats, reduce glutamate release (but see an opposite finding in hippocampus by Bouron and Reuter (1999)).

Most studies show a decrease in the evoked AMPA EPSP/ Cs by DA (Law-Tho et al., 1994; Zheng et al., 1999; Seamans et al., 2001a; Urban et al., 2002; Gao et al., 2001; Gao and Goldman-Rakic, 2003b), three studies reported an increase in such EPSP/Cs (Wang et al., 2002a; Gonzalez-Islas and Hablitz, 2003; Marek and Aghajanian, 1999). However, in two of these latter studies (Wang et al., 2002a; Marek and Aghajanian, 1999) the effect was

specifically in terms of an increase in the frequency of spontaneous EPSCs that may reflect changes in pyramidal cell excitability rather than a direct D1 receptor mediated increase in presynaptic glutamate release. In contrast, another group showed that in layer II–III PFC neurons there is a DA mediated reduction in sEPSCs (Zhou and Hablitz, 1999) although DA was later shown to enhance both AMPA and NMDA EPSCs in these layers (Gonzalez-Islas and Hablitz, 2003).

One explanation for the apparently contradictory results may be that the effects of DA and D1 agonists on PFC neurons are input-specific. Spontaneous EPSCs are due to synaptic inputs impinging onto the entire cell, whereas evoked EPSPs are due to focal stimulation of mainly a discrete subset of synaptic inputs. Such input specificity was discussed by Urban et al. (2002) to resolve the discrepant findings that stimulation evoked EPSCs, but not paired-cell EPSCs, were decreased by DA. A similar case has recently been made by Gao and Goldman-Rakic (2003b) who showed that DA reduced fast-spiking to pyramidal “perisomatic” IPSPs, but not non-fast-spiking to pyramidal “peridendritic” IPSPs in paired-cell recordings from ferret PFC. Therefore, the effects of DA may be specific to certain synapses distributed in different cortical layers or on different types of inputs (FEATURE #4).

---

**FEATURE #4: The effects of DA may be synapse and neuron specific.**

If present, a presynaptic D1 receptor action on AMPA EPSCs is likely due to a reduction of glutamate release (Momiyama et al., 1996). The recent immuno-EM finding of D1 receptor-immunoreactivity on axonal terminals that form asymmetric synapses (putative glutamatergic) on dendritic spines of PFC neurons (Paspalas and Goldman-Rakic, 2002) has provided a structural basis for this hypothesis. However, this structural relationship does not imply targeted selective actions of DA. Rather, DA is likely released in a diffuse manner and modulates subsets of synapses that contain the relevant DA receptors.

## 7. Distinct features of DA modulation of synaptic responses

### 7.1. Delayed onset and a prolonged duration of DA modulation of synaptic responses

With regard to NMDA-mediated synaptic responses, most studies have reported that DA via D1 receptors, increased NMDA-mediated responses in striatum (Cépeda et al., 1992, 1999; Cépeda and Levine, 1998; Levine et al., 1996a, 1996b; Flores-Hernandez et al., 2002), hippocampal (Yang, 2000; Huang and Kandel, 1995) and cortical neurons

(Zheng et al., 1999; Seamans et al., 2001a; Chen and Yang, 2002a; Wang and O’Donnell, 2001). A partial list of these data is provided in Table 3 (also see Section 7.2). Studies on dorsal striatal neurons suggest the increase is mediated by PKA (Umemiya and Raymond, 1997; Flores-Hernandez et al., 2002), whereas, in ventral striatal neurons, it is mediated by protein kinase C (Chergui and Lacey, 1999).

One common feature of the D1 modulation of NMDA responses in vitro is its delayed onset and prolonged duration. This effect was shown by Huang and Kandel (1995) who termed the effect “late potentiation”. Fig. 4 is taken from this study and illustrates how a single application of a D1 agonist can slowly increase the field EPSP response in hippocampal CA1 neurons to 140% of their baseline levels for >3 h. This effect was largely eliminated in the presence of an NMDA antagonist, indicating that much of the potentiation was due to an increase in the NMDA component. Similar results were observed using patch-clamp recordings of hippocampal neurons (Yang, 2000). Moreover, activation of D1 receptors, protein kinase A (PKA) or adenylate cyclase have been shown to induce similarly delayed and long-lasting effects on various synaptic currents evoked in hippocampal neurons (Greengard et al., 1991; Yang, 2000) neostriatal neurons (Colwell and Levine, 1995; Umemiya and Raymond, 1997) retinal horizontal cells (Pereda et al., 1992), cerebellar parallel fibers (Salin et al., 1996; Mitoma and Konishi, 1996) midbrain DA neurons (Cameron and Williams, 1993) and PFC neurons (Seamans et al., 2001a, 2001b; Chen and Yang, 2002a; Urban et al., 2002). In contrast to the D1 effect, Huang and Kandel (1995) showed that selective D2 agonists have the opposite effect in that they produce a fast onset decrease in the field EPSP response that returns to baseline more quickly than the D1-mediated effect. A similar profile will be described further for DA modulation of GABAergic IPSCs in PFC neurons.

FEATURE #5: DA exerts long-lasting effects after it has been cleared (or washed out).

### 7.2. Possible intracellular mechanisms that mediate the prolonged D1 modulation of glutamatergic synaptic responses

What might be the intracellular mechanisms underlying these prolonged D1-mediated effects? Under physiological conditions, functional glutamate receptors and voltage-dependent ion channels that are modulated by DA are undergoing states of phosphorylation and dephosphorylation (Greengard, 2001; Winder and Sweatt, 2001). While phosphorylated receptors or channels are activated for prolonged periods of time (Blank et al., 1997; Swoop et al., 1999; Wang and Salter, 1994), dephosphorylation of receptors or channels shortens the activation state considerably (Lieberman and Mody, 1994; Tong et al., 1995).protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) at receptor and channel proteins (Blank et al., 1997). Thus, there is a bidirectional action of DARPP32 that mediates the initial steps of the prolonged D1 actions observed in slices and in vivo (Greengard, 2001). It has been hypothesized that phosphorylation activation of membrane proteins critical to these initial synaptic changes (e.g. receptors, kinases) may also serve as ‘synaptic tags’ that enable other downstream gene expression products to recognize and interact functionally for more prolonged changes (Frey and Morris, 1997, 1998).

In the second phase of intracellular events, minutes to hours after D1 stimulation, Ca²⁺ influx via NMDA receptors and voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels activates Ca²⁺-dependent kinases and phosphatases. Translocation of these enzymes to the soma may signal the activation of transcription factors such as CREB and immediate early genes. In turn, a whole host of ‘late’ genes are activated that encode for the synthesis of membrane and cytoskeletal proteins to mediate actual structural changes in dendritic spines (Murphy and Segal, 1997; Sanes and Lichtman, 1999; Maletic-Savatic et al., 1999; Engert and Bonhoeffer, 1999; Trachtenberget al., 2002; Harris et al., 2003; Lamprecht and LeDoux, 2003). Besides this long route of communication by transduction signals that move all the way from the synapse to the nucleus in the somatic region of the neuron, the presence of mRNAs and ribosomal protein synthesis machinery within synaptic locations in the dendrites could enable the activity-dependent, prolonged actions of DA to be supported by synthesis of new local synaptic proteins (Ouyang et al., 1999; Job and Eberwine, 2001; Steward and Schuman, 2001; Richter and Lorenz, 2002).

### 7.3. Dose dependence to the DA modulation of synaptic responses

As noted earlier, in most studies the non-NMDA component of the EPSC is only slightly reduced by DA (Cépeda et al., 1993, 1998; Seamans et al., 2001a; Zheng et al., 1999; Urban et al., 2002). In contrast, Law-Tho et al. (1994) and Gao et al. (2001) reported a large decrease in the evoked non-NMDA EPSP, or the EPSP evoked in pairs of pyramidal neurons, respectively. One difference between these studies and others that showed a more moderate reduction in non-NMDA currents was that higher concentrations of DA were applied (0.1–10 mM focally or via the bath). These data might imply that the magnitude of the modulation by DA of non-NMDA EPSCs is dose-dependent.

There appears to be a clear dose-dependency to the DA modulation of NMDA currents. The NMDA EPSC evoked by synaptic stimulation of layer V (using low frequency stimulation), or focal NMDA pressure-puff was potentiated by low doses of DA or a D1 agonist (≤10 μM) (Seamans et al., 2001a; Zheng et al., 1999). However, at higher doses of DA (>50 μM), attenuation of the NMDA current resulted. The low dose-mediated potentiation of the NMDA EPSC is D1 receptor-dependent while the attenuation of NMDA

EPSCs at higher doses of DA required D2 receptors (Zheng et al., 1999; Seamans et al., 2001a).

The potentiation of evoked NMDA EPSCs in PFC neurons is consistent with the early findings of Cépeda and colleagues who first showed that iontophoretic DA or D1 agonists potentiates NMDA induced depolarization and firing in human cortical neurons and striatal neurons in vitro (for review see Cépeda and Levine, 1998). Furthermore, in vivo microiontophoretic studies in striatum and accumbens also showed that at very low iontophoretic current (1–8 nA) DA induced a potentiation (≤30%) of glutamate-mediated excitation, whereas at higher iontophoretic current (>15 nA), the glutamate-induced excitation was suppressed (Hu and White, 1997; White and Wang, 1986; Kiyatkin and Rebec, 1996). The above data confirm the initial report of DA modulation of synaptic responses in PFC neurons that showed that DA at a high concentration of 100 μM (in the presence of DA reuptake blocker nomifensine) depressed both NMDA and non-NMDA responses (Law-Tho et al., 1994), while still being consistent with more recent data showing that a D1 agonist (at 10 μM) can potentiate inward current induced by iontophoretic NMDA or synaptically evoked NMDA EPSCs (Zheng et al., 1999; Seamans et al., 2001a; Chen and Yang, 2002a, 2002b).

---

FEATURE #6: DA can exert bidirectional effects on a physiological measure at different concentrations.

---

Although most groups show that D1 receptor activation increases NMDA responses, two groups reported that under their experimental conditions, they could not find DA potentiation of NMDA EPSC in striatal neurons in vitro (Calabresi et al., 1995; Beurrier and Malenka, 2002). Beurrier and Malenka (2002) performed their experiments at room temperature in C57BL/6 mice striatal slices and used a high dose of DA (75 μM DA perfused for 10 min) to show that DA suppressed corticostriatal NMDA EPSCs that were recorded using Cs⁺-filled electrodes at a relatively high baseline stimulation rate of 0.1 Hz (Beurrier and Malenka, 2002). Based on the findings reviewed earlier, the higher concentration of DA predictably would suppress or have no effect on NMDA EPSCs.

In the second study that failed to observe a DA–NMDA interaction, Calabresi et al. (1995) performed their experiments at 35 °C in striatal slices obtained from 150–200 g Wistar rats. Using perfusate with normal Mg²⁺ (1.2 mM) and with no GABAₐ antagonists, the striatal neurons were voltage- or current-clamped at –86 mV. These experimental conditions did not readily enable NMDA receptor mediated responses to be revealed. The membrane depolarization induced by bath application of NMDA (30 μM for 1 min) was not affected by bath application of DA (30 μM), or by the D1 agonist SKF38393. It should be noted that the effects of D1–NMDA interaction typically has a slow onset and
requires some blockade of tonic GABA<sub>A</sub>-mediated inhibition, since D1 receptor stimulation concomitantly modulates GABA<sub>A</sub> IPSCs in a complex fashion (which will be discussed further). Without sufficient GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor blockade, the D1-mediated modulation of GABA currents could occlude any effect on the NMDA current. Furthermore, the peak NMDA response is typically reached only at ~15 min after termination of a brief application of DA or the D1 agonist (Yang, 2000; Seamans et al., 2001a; Zheng et al., 1999; Huang and Kandel, 1995; Chen and Yang, 2002a) and this could easily be missed if shorter sampling times are used. All these important factors might have precluded an observable DA-mediated potentiation of NMDA responses.

### 7.4. Bidirectional modulation by D1 receptor activation (Table 3)

Not only can DA act at different concentrations on different receptors to exert opposing physiological actions, but strong versus weak D1 receptor activation alone can produce opposing actions. Recently, Chen and Yang (2002a) have provided preliminary evidence to show that evoked NMDA receptor mediated synaptic responses in low Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM) media are modulated in a complex manner by the DA D1 receptor, consistent with the inverted-‘U’ function formulation observed in behavioral studies (Arnsten, 1997) (Fig. 3). Specifically, the full D1 agonists dihydrexidine or A77636 induced a biphasic modulation of the evoked NMDA EPSC in layer V PFC neurons in vitro. A dose-dependent potentiation of the NMDA EPSC at up to 10 μM of agonist was followed by an attenuated response when agonist concentration was ≥100 μM (e.g. 100–500 μM) (Fig. 5).

Potentiation of NMDA-mediated postsynaptic currents by low doses of D1 agonists in PFC (Chen and Yang, 2002a; Seamans et al., 2001a; Zheng et al., 1999) is consistent with the activation of D1/PKA/DARPP32 intracellular pathways that exert potent inhibition of protein phosphatase-1 (PPT1) that prevents dephosphorylation of the NMDA receptor channel and thus enables a persistent potentiation of the NMDA response (Blank et al., 1997; Snyder et al., 1998; Flores-Hernandez et al., 2002). The reason for the attenuation with high D1 agonist concentrations may be due to a dual inhibition of glutamate release. First, by directly activating presynaptic D1 receptors, presynaptic glutamate release is reduced as discussed earlier. Second, D1 potentiation of NMDA receptor function can also lead to an increased release of adenosine (Craig and White, 1993; Dunwiddle and Masino, 2001; Manzoni et al., 1994). In turn, the liberated adenosine retrogradely acts on presynaptic A1 receptors on glutamatergic afferents (Harvey and Lacey, 1997) to cause presynaptic inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission via a local suppression of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity (Scholtz and Miller, 1996). Future studies are needed to confirm these possibilities as well as additional mechanisms that could contribute to the

![Figure 5](#fig5)
**Fig. 5.** The inverted-‘U’ dose-response curve for D1 modulation of synaptically evoked NMDA currents recorded in PFC neurons in vitro. In low Mg<sup>2+</sup> (0.1 mM), pharmacologically isolated (in the presence of AMPA, GABAb antagonists), synaptically evoked NMDA EPSCs were potentiated by a D1 agonist (dihydrexidine or A77636, 0.1–10 μM and optimal at 10 μM). However, beyond >10 μM, the D1 agonist attenuated the NMDA-EPSC, thus yielding an inverted-‘U’ dose-response curve similar to that in working memory tasks.

attenuation of synaptically evoked NMDA EPSC, including a possible direct blockade of NMDA receptors by very high concentrations of D1 agonists (Castro et al., 1999) or a calcineurin-mediated NMDA receptor downregulation (Tong et al., 1995; Shi et al., 2000) due to NMDA receptor hyper-modulation by D1 receptor activation.

The relationship between D1 receptor stimulation and changes in NMDA EPSC amplitude at a single cell level (Fig. 5) is similar to the inverted-‘U’-shape function for D1 receptor stimulation required for successful working memory performance as shown earlier (Fig. 3). The high doses of D1 agonist are relevant because in most of the behavioral studies where D1 agonists were injected directly into the PFC to show a disruption of working memory performance, the D1 agonist concentrations were ≥0.4 μg/0.5 μl, which is equivalent to a concentration of 0.5–1 mM (Seamans et al., 1998; Floresco and Phillips, 2001; Zahrt et al., 1997). This biphasic/bidirectional modulation of NMDA receptors by D1 stimulation could therefore have important implications given the important role of NMDA receptors in the cellular aspects of working memory (Durstewitz et al., 2000a, 2000b; Wang, 1999; Lisman et al., 1998; Aura and Riekkinen, 1999; Lee and Kesner, 2002; Li et al., 1997; Romanides et al., 1999). Since hyper-D1 receptor activation can attenuate NMDA EPSCs, these data predict that the acute high dose (≥100 μM) of D1 agonist that impairs working memory could be prevented by co-administration of low doses of D1 antagonist to return NMDA function to normal. This phenomenon has been supported by the electrophysiological findings obtained by Williams and

Goldman-Rakic (1995) in primate and behavioral data of Zahrt et al. (1997) in rodent PFC.

Recent findings in cultured neurons have revealed yet another level of bidirectional modulation of NMDA currents by PKA and protein-protein interactions. For the same neuron with a similar level of D1 receptor stimulation at a similar time point, exactly opposite effects could be obtained. Lee et al. (2002) reported that regions of the D1 receptor could directly couple to NMDA receptor subunits NR1-1a and NR2A to decrease NMDA receptor-mediated currents. Hence, on the one hand, D1 receptor appears to increase the NMDA current via DARPP32 suppression of PP1's dephosphorylation of the NR1 subunit (Blank et al., 1997; Colwell and Levine, 1995; Snyder et al., 1998; Flores-Hernandez et al., 2002). On the other hand, direct coupling of D1 receptors to the NR1-1a subunit (in the presence of protein kinase inhibitors) decreases the NMDA current directly (Lee et al., 2002; Salter, 2003). This novel direct receptor-receptor oligomerization mechanism (Bouvier, 2001; Gazi et al., 2002) has also been shown for the D5/GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor interaction (Liu et al., 2000). Furthermore, when NR is physically interacting with membrane D1 receptor in cultured neurons, this also enables an increased insertion of cytoplasmic D1 receptors on the plasma membrane surface and enhances D1 receptor-mediated cAMP accumulation via a SNARE-dependent mechanism (Scott et al., 2002; Pei et al., 2004). Presumably, D1 activation will, in turn, modulate the NMDA receptor mediated responses as reviewed earlier. It is not known under what physiological conditions that this kind of bidirectional D1-NMDA receptor interaction via protein-protein interactions occurs and what regulates this kind of interaction.

glutamate release and suppress postsynaptic non-NMDA receptor functions, respectively.

At very high exogenous concentration of DA (0.1–3 mM), a rapidly reversible, voltage-dependent blockade of inward NMDA current has been shown in cultured hippocampal neurons (Castro et al., 1999; Kotecha et al., 2002). The strong blockade by DA at very negative holding potentials (e.g. –90 mV), but much less at positive holding potentials (e.g. –30 mV), suggests open channel/‘trapping’ type of channel blockade, similar to that mediated by PCP or MK801 for NMDA channels (McBain and Mayer, 1994; Dilmore and Johnson, 1998). A D2 class agonist (quinpirole at 10 μM; Kotecha et al., 2002) did suppress the NMDA current but failed to show a voltage-dependent block of the NMDA channel that was demonstrated with very high concentration of either DA (Kotecha et al., 2003) or the D1 agonist SKF38393 (100 μM; Castro et al., 1999).

Quinpirole also acts via D4 receptors to suppress synaptically evoked NMDA EPSCs in hippocampal CA1 neurons. Using cloned D4 receptor expressing cell lines, D4 receptor stimulation can transactivate a receptor tyrosine kinase called platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) to initiate internal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> release, which then stimulates calmodulin to inactivate NMDA receptors (Kotecha et al., 2002). In PFC neurons, the selective D4 agonist PD168077 also suppresses NMDA induced currents or synaptically evoked NMDA EPSCs (Wang et al., 2003). Here, a different intracellular signaling pathway mediates this action. In PFC, postsynaptic D4 receptor activation inhibits PKA and subsequent activation of protein phosphatase-1 to reduce a CaM kinase II regulation of NMDA receptors. This results in D4-mediated NMDA receptor internalization (Wang et al., 2003), which is in the opposite direction to the proposed receptor trafficking mediated by D1 receptor stimulation (Dunah and Standaert, 2001). Thus, both a PKA-independent (in hippocampal CA1) and PKA-dependent intracellular signaling pathways regulate D4 suppression of NMDA receptor-channel complexes.

7.5. **D2 class receptor modulation of AMPA and NMDA receptors**

In human cortical neurons or rat striatal neurons, Cépeda et al. (1992, 1993) found that D2 agonists (quinpirole) suppress membrane depolarization and spike discharge induced by direct iontophoretic application of quisqualate (AMPA receptor agonist), suggesting a postsynaptic D2 receptor suppression of non-NMDA receptor function. Presynaptic D2 class receptors located on glutamatergic terminals have also been implicated in functionally suppressing non-AMPA mediated glutamate synaptic transmission in neurons of the VTA, striatum, and parabrachial nucleus (Chen et al., 1999; Levine et al., 1996a, 1996b; Hsu et al., 1995; Koga and Momiyama, 2000). Thus, both pre- and postsynaptic D2 class receptors may reduce presynaptic

8. **DA modulation of synaptic input trains to the HIPP and PFC**

8.1. **Short-term changes in synaptic plasticity**

Multiple forms of short-term plasticity are present in layer V PFC neurons from young rats (Hempel et al., 2000; Seamans et al., 2001a). Both short-term depression and post-tetanic augmentation co-exist in the same synapses in layer V pyramidal PFC neurons. During a train of stimuli delivered to layer I–III (from 1 to 50 Hz), short-term frequency-dependent synaptic depression occurred following each stimulus within the train (Hempel et al., 2000). Immediately after the train of stimuli was over, a brief period of synaptic augmentation (~1 min) followed
when baseline stimulation of the inputs (0.1 Hz) resumed. The magnitude of this post-tetanic augmentation is much greater in PFC than in visual cortex. Computational simulations of recurrently connected networks showed that this short-term synaptic enhancement can temporally boost or strengthen recurrent synaptic responses. This could aid in persistent firing activity that may underlie delayed period firing in short-term working memory tasks (Hempel et al., 2000). Therefore, understanding the roles of DA in this type of short-term plasticity may provide insights into the synaptic mechanisms for DA in short-term working memory processes.

DA has been shown to regulate the mode of short-term synaptic depression in PFC (Seamans et al., 2001a; Otani et al., 1998). Two components of the synaptic response train were detected. In response to a 20 Hz tetanic train, there is a reduced initial NMDA-independent response due to a reduction in presynaptic release probability described earlier. There was also a prolonged depolarizing envelope produced by summation of later synaptic responses in the train. Activation of the D1 receptor increased this mainly NMDA-mediated component of the summed synaptic response. Collectively, these effects tended to counteract the effects of synaptic depression and equalize the response train, making the excitatory inputs act more like constant current sources. This is of interest because PFC neurons fire in the 20 Hz frequency range during delay periods (Batuev et al., 1985; Sawaguchi et al., 1986, 1988; Sawaguchi et al., 1990a, 1990b; Funahashi et al., 1989; Funahashi and Takeda, 2002; Fuster, 1973). This mechanism may therefore be involved in the significant enhancement in delay-period activity by D1 agonists mentioned earlier (Table 1). Because D1 agonists also decreased single EPSPs that occurred early in the train (mainly AMPA-mediated), yet enhanced the late depolarization (mainly NMDA-mediated), it appears that the frequency dependence of the inputs determines the effect DA will have. Recently, a similar effect was observed for trains of EPSPs onto interneurons in the primate PFC (Gonzalez-Burgos et al., 2004). The idea of selective filtering of different input frequencies by DA is not new. In nucleus accumbens neurons recorded extracellularly, DA reduced the fimbria-induced synaptic field response at 0.5 Hz but enhanced the response evoked at 6 Hz stimulation (DeFrance et al., 1985). DA has also been shown to increase glutamate- or acetylcholine-induced firing relative to background firing activity (Yang and Mogenson, 1990; Rebec, 1998).

---

FEATURE #8: The effect of DA on synaptic responses depends on their frequency components and the relative contribution of NMDA and non-NMDA receptors. Slow trains or single pulse inputs would be depressed while faster trains should be relatively enhanced.

---

### 8.1.1. Impact of network activity

Not only does the frequency components of individual synaptic inputs influence the direction of DA modulation, so does the state of the entire network the neuron is embedded in. In computer simulations of realistic PFC circuits, if the network is quiescent, simulated D1 receptor stimulation exerts negligible effects on spontaneous firing relative to the large enhancement in evoked “delay-period” persistent firing (Durstewitz et al., 2000a; Durstewitz and Seamans, 2002). This is because at low levels of spontaneous activity there is little NMDA current relative to GABA currents. Thus, the functional effect of the D1-mediated increase in long-range GABA responses (Seamans et al., 2001b) far outweighs any increase in NMDA currents concurrently produced by these receptors. In contrast when persistent activity is initiated, the NMDA drive is very strong (Seamans et al., 2003; Wang, 1999; Lisman et al., 1998), and D1-mediated enhancement of NMDA currents increases this type of activity even further. This effect is also under competition by the D1-mediated increases in fast-spiking interneuron firing and GABAergic currents (Zhou and Hablitz, 1999; Seamans et al., 2001b; Gorelova et al., 2002) that tend to ‘tune’ the persistent activity once evoked. Therefore, DA could have different effects at different network activity levels because it modulates both inhibitory (GABA<sub>A</sub>) and voltage-dependent excitatory (NMDA) responses. This is a very important aspect of DA action that is often overlooked in slices and anesthetized preparations when basal neuronal activity is relatively low.

---

FEATURE #9: The effect of DA may depend on the level of activity in the local PFC network and DA might have opposite effects at high and low activity levels.

---

A meta-analysis of the published effects of DA in vivo tends to support this hypothesis. As shown in Fig. 6 in studies where the animal is anesthetized, DA produces an inhibition in spontaneous background activity. However, as PFC networks become more active, as in the case when an animal is awake, an opposite effect of DA results such that iontophoretically applied DA now facilitates spike firing. As the network activity increases even further, such as during the delay period of a working memory task, DA tends to produce a robust increase in the already high firing level.

### 8.1.2. Role of neuronal ‘up’ and ‘down’ states

Spontaneous, abrupt membrane potential transitions from a hyperpolarized or resting potential (‘down’ state) to a near-threshold depolarized ‘up’ state, have been shown in different brain regions during various stages of the natural sleep-wake cycle in vivo, as well as in reduced cortical slabs or organotypic cultures in vitro (Plenz and Aertsen, 1996; Plenz and Kitai, 1996; Steriade, 2001; Stern et al., 1997;

Fig. 6. Meta-analysis of studies examining the effects of DA on the firing rate of PFC neurons recorded extracellularly in vivo in rats and primates. The gray line is the approximate control spike frequency and the black line is the approximate spike frequency after DA application. Note that at low levels of network activity the effect of DA is mainly inhibitory but in awake animals and those performing working memory tasks, the effect of DA is excitatory. Data summarized from Sawaguchi et al. (1986, 1988, 1990a, 1990b), Sawaguchi (2001), Pirot et al. (1992), Mantz et al. (1992), Sesack and Bunney (1989), Ferron et al. (1984), Godbout et al. (1991), Bunney and Aghajanian (1976) and Mora et al. (1976).

mulation can have exactly opposing actions (FEATURE #1), it also highlights that the properties or pervious history of the neuron itself, independent of DA, dictates the direction of DA effects that will take place in the immediate future.

---

**FEATURE #10: The effect of DA depends on the membrane potential of the neuron. DA is hypothesized to be suppressive at hyperpolarized membrane potentials and facilitatory and positive membrane potentials.**

While this hypothesis can explain a number of findings, it may require further refinement to capture the staggering complexity of the DA system. For instance, in anesthetized rats, West and Grace (2002) used intracellular in vivo recordings of striatal neurons undergoing up and down state transitions and found that a D1 antagonist reverse dialysed into the striatum in vivo potently reduced firing of striatal neurons recorded intracellularly regardless of whether they were in the ‘up’ or ‘down’ state. In contrast, a D2 antagonist always enhanced firing. One reason for these in vivo data to depart from the predicted results as proposed earlier is that the theory of differential ‘up’ and ‘down’ state modulation was based largely on simulating ‘up’ states by intracellular current injections in in vitro preparations where there were no intrinsic ‘up’ and ‘down’ state transitions. However, studies of the mechanisms underlying ‘up’ states demonstrated that while these states are shaped by intrinsic currents, they depend almost entirely on synaptic input and are completely abolished by glutamatergic antagonists (Seamans et al., 2003; Sanchez-Vives and McCormick, 2000; Steriade et al., 1993a, 1993b; McCormick et al., 2003). Based on these data, tests of state-dependent actions of DA should consider the effect of DA on glutamate and GABAergic currents that ultimately drive up-state transitions.

### 8.2. Long-term changes in synaptic plasticity

#### 8.2.1. LTP

Within the hippocampus where the bulk of LTP/LTD studies were first conducted, the DA D1 antagonist (SCH23390), protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin, or competitive PKA inhibitor Rp-cAMP prevented the maintenance of the late phase (>3 h) LTP of CA1 field EPSPs evoked by tetanic stimulation of the Schaffer collateral inputs (Frey et al., 1990; Frey et al., 1993; Matthies and Reymann, 1993; Huang and Kandel, 1995; Impey et al., 1996). This long-lasting LTP response can also be induced by application of D1/5 agonists (SKF38393, SKF81297), forskolin or phosphodiesterase inhibitor (Rolipram) alone (Impey et al., 1996; Barad et al., 1998) during, but not 15–25 s after, tetanus induced LTP. Moreover, D1 receptor knock-out mice do not express the late phase of long-term potentiation in CA1 synapses (Matthies et al., 1997; Huang

et al., 2004). Collectively, these findings suggest that D1 receptor stimulation activates the PKA pathway and leads to gene transcription and synthesis of proteins that are essential for maintenance of long-term changes in activity-dependent synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus.

For the Schaffer collateral → CA1 pathway, D1 agonists (dihydrexidine or SKF81297) or forskolin also enhance the early, decayable phase of tetanus-induced LTP (lasting 1–3 h) (Otmakhova and Lisman, 1996). Furthermore, D1 agonists block the depotentiation produced by low frequency (2–3 Hz) pulses that are delivered within a short time window (15–25 s) after tetanus-induced LTP in CA1 (Otmakhova and Lisman, 1998). These studies illustrate that DA can “alter the rules” of synaptic plasticity in the Schaffer collateral → CA1 pathway by preventing a ‘memory erasure’ (depotentiation) process and/or enhancing the incorporation of information from one network to another, perhaps during ‘memory recall’ (Lisman and Otmakhova, 2001). On the other hand, DA suppresses the direct entorhinal cortical excitatory input to the CA1, which normally transmits specific sensory information from the cortex to the hippocampus. This suppressive effect is partially blocked by a D1 antagonist (SCH23390), but completely blocked by the atypical antipsychotic clozapine (at 20 μM) (Otmakhova and Lisman, 1999). The suppressive effects of DA on perforant path-CA1 synapse may be important in a complex process involving comparison, prediction and detection of novelty, whereby converging signals via the classical trisynaptic perforant path → dentate gyrus → CA3 pathways are ‘compared’ and any mismatch from expectation (novelty) may be integrated in CA1 (Lisman and Otmakhova, 2001).

Efferents from the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus (HIPP) project via the fimbria-fornix monosynaptically to the PFC (Jay and Witter, 1991; Carr and Sesack, 1996; Floresco et al., 1997, 2001a) and constitute an important pathway that directly links two major higher cognitive processing centers. Glutamatergic HIPP output neurons form asymmetric synapses onto PFC neurons and when stimulated at a low frequency (e.g. 1 Hz) the excitatory synaptic response is primarily mediated by AMPA receptors in vivo (Jay et al., 1992; Gigg et al., 1994; Baumbarger et al., 2001). Doyere and Burette (1993) first demonstrated that during training in an associative learning task in freely-moving rats, there is a delayed increase in synaptic transmission in the HIPP → PFC pathway, suggesting that there may be an activity-dependent “enhancement of the efficacy of this pathway during a critical phase of memory consolidation that requires the long-term storage of explicit associations”.

DA applied by local reverse dialysis into the PFC facilitates the expression of an NMDA-dependent LTP induced in the HIPP-PFC pathway in vivo (Jay et al., 1996; Gurden et al., 2000). Similarly, if endogenous DA is released by burst stimulation of the VTA (50 Hz, 2 s), LTP in the HIPP → PFC pathway is also enhanced (Gurden et al., 1999). This

HIPP → PFC LTP apparently is age-dependent with the LTP being induced only in adult animals whereas prepubertal animals show mainly LTD by the same induction process (Takita et al., 1999). Single-pulse low frequency stimulation of the VTA transiently decreases PFC responses to HIPP stimulation (Jay et al., 1996; Gurden et al., 1999; Jay, 2003). Such low frequency (every 30 s) single-pulse stimulation of the VTA prior to each single pulse HIPP stimulation may selectively release GABA either locally or from the GABAergic component in the VTA → PFC pathway (Kosaka et al., 1987; Carr and Sesack, 2000) to suppress the evoked PFC responses. Hence, DA released by burst-stimulation may selectively enhance NMDA receptor-dependent LTP responses, while GABA released by single-pulse stimulation of VTA selectively suppresses AMPA mediated synaptic responses in vivo.

In rat PFC slices, Hirsch and Crépel (1990, 1991, 1992) first demonstrated that strong tetanic stimulation of layer I–II (50–100 Hz) induces an NMDA- and intracellular Ca²⁺-dependent LTP in layer V pyramidal neurons. The strong tetanic stimulation might also have released sufficient endogenous glutamate (and perhaps endogenous DA as well) to stimulate extrasynaptic mGluRs to mediate this LTP (Vickery et al., 1997; Lujan et al., 1997).

### 8.2.2. LTD

LTD has been speculated to be a functional component perhaps more relevant than LTP to short-term working memory processes (Laroche et al., 2000). LTD may provide the mechanisms to remove unwanted long-term changes in synaptic plasticity during on-line processing of information that varies from one trial to another. Indeed, in a ‘delayed Win-shift’ working memory task (Fig. 2) requiring the HIPP → PFC pathway (Floresco et al., 1997) LTD is observed in this pathway during learning (Burette et al., 2000). Notably, this task is identical to that used in Fig. 2 whereby transient increases in PFC DA were observed, however the link between task-dependent LTD and DA release has not yet been established. While LTD in hippocampus is typically induced by low frequency stimulation for a prolonged period of time (e.g. 1 Hz for 30 min), Otani et al. (1998, 1999, 2002, 2003) found that tetanic stimulation of layer I–II afferents to the apical dendrites of layer V pyramidal PFC neurons (50 Hz trains of stimuli), which when given alone is insufficient to induce LTD, in the presence of a high concentration of DA (100 μM for 10 min), induced LTD (Otani et al., 1998).

Unlike the typical LTD induction protocols used in hippocampal slices in vitro (1–2 Hz for 30 min; Barry et al., 1996; Kerr and Abraham, 1996), LTD in PFC slices can be induced in the presence of high concentration of DA (100 μM) coupled with a previously ineffective higher frequency (50 Hz) tetanic stimulation of the PFC. A prior exposure to this high concentration of DA alone (which reversibly suppresses normal synaptic responses in PFC) ensures that subsequent DA application that is coupled to a

50 Hz tetanic stimulation will induce LTP (Blond et al., 2002). Therefore, the history of DA exposure to PFC neurons appears to be a factor in determining the direction of change in synaptic weight (FEATURE #11). Since layer I–II of PFC primarily receives transcortical and entorhinal inputs (Insauti et al., 1997; Delatour and Witter, 2002), it is most likely that these cortical afferents, rather than HIPP inputs originating from the ventral subiculum, were activated in these in vitro studies (Jay and Witter, 1991; Jay et al., 1992; Yang et al., 1999a).

FEATURE #11: Prior DA stimulation can potently influence future changes in synaptic plasticity. Therefore, predicting how PFC circuits will influence behavior requires knowledge of past DA activity.

via D1 receptors, reduced extracellular PFC GABA levels. However, a significant decrease was not observed if the concentrations of SKF38393 were <20 μM and did not occur for >50 min after local perfusion. It is not known how existing basal endogenous PFC DA tone in vivo might influence potential D1 agonist-mediated effects. Another dialysis study by Grobin and Deutch (1998) showed that a D1 agonist did not alter in vivo microdialysis GABA levels, but a D2 agonist delivered into the PFC via the dialysis probe resulted in a dose-dependent increase in extracellular GABA levels.

Using a different technique in PFC slices, Rétaux et al. (1991a) showed that a D1 agonist inhibited the electrically-evoked release of [³H]GABA. However, this reduction in GABA release was reversed by a D2 antagonist. In contrast, Penit-Soria et al. (1989) reported that D1 agonist had no effect on spontaneous release of pre-loaded [³H]GABA in PFC slices. Rétaux et al. (1991a, 1991b) also showed that a D2 agonist reduced the electrically-evoked release of pre-loaded [³H]GABA in PFC, but enhanced the spontaneous release of [³H]GABA in PFC slices.

In other subcortical brain regions different results have also been obtained. In midbrain DA-containing tissue, Starr (1987) reported that a D1 agonist and forskolin enhanced, while a D2 agonist decreased, [³H]GABA release. Using these same techniques in striatal slices, identical results were obtained by at least three groups who showed that a D1 agonist increased [³H]GABA overflow, while a D2 agonist decreased [³H]GABA overflow (Harsing and Zigmond, 1997; Bernath and Zigmond, 1989; Girault et al., 1986; Floran et al., 1990, 1997). When the data from all tissue types are viewed collectively one finds evidence that a D2 agonist both increases and decreases GABA levels, while a D1 agonist either increases, reduces or has no effect on GABA levels, yet when reductions occur they are blocked by a D2 antagonist. But, in non-PFC tissue, there is increasing consensus for the bidirectional modulation of GABA as described by Harsing and Zigmond (1997) in striatum, whereby D2 receptor stimulation decreases and D1 receptor stimulation increases GABA release (FEATURE #12). Electrophysiological studies on diverse neurons examining DA modulation of GABAAergic inhibition also converge on a similar conclusion, as discussed below.

---

FEATURE #12: Stimulation of D1 versus D2 receptors can have opposing actions on GABAAergic responses.

---

The effects of DA on this form of NMDA-independent LTD are complex and may to some extent involve postsynaptic group I and II mGluR activation that results in the associated increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) release. During the 50 Hz tetanic stimulation, DA prolonged the depolarization of layer V pyramidal cells but this effect was attenuated by \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) — chelation by intracellular BAPTA (Otani et al., 1999). DA may enhance postsynaptic depolarization, which increases moderate \(Ca^{2+}\) entry via voltage-gated \(Ca^{2+}\) channels that would trigger LTD induction. Undoubtedly, this tetanic stimulation also leads to a large increase in endogenous glutamate (which will activate extrasynaptic mGluRs) and DA release in PFC slices. Several conditions favor the emergence of this LTD induction: (a) group I mGluR activation (will increase \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) (Morris et al., 1999); (b) group II mGluR activation (during tetanus can also activate PLC and PLD pathways, in addition to suppression of adenylate cyclase that it normally couples to); and (c) co-activation of D1 together with mGluR I and II receptors alone (without tetanus). Activation of these receptors converge on the MAP-kinase pathway to mediate LTD in PFC (Otani et al., 1999, 2002). Therefore, given the complexity of the processes involved in LTD and LTP induction and the uncertainty about the precise DA levels and levels of intracellular signaling molecules during a tetanus, it is difficult to use the basic modes of action of DA to explain or to predict its complex regulation of long-term plasticity, other than to say that DA plays an important role in altering synaptic weights.

9. Modulation of inhibitory synaptic responses

9.1. DA regulation of GABA release in vivo and in vitro

In vivo microdialysis of GABA in brain is technically challenging and the effects of DA on GABA efflux have been controversial. Abekawa et al. (2000) showed that DA,

9.2. Measurements of GABAAergic synaptic responses in non-PFC neurons

In striatal GABAAergic projection neurons, DA, via D2 receptors, reduced evoked IPSC amplitude and spontaneous IPSC frequency, suggesting a presynaptic mode of action

(Delgado et al., 2000). Likewise, the IPSC in pallidal neurons produced by stimulation of the efferents of the striatum, was also reduced by DA via D2 receptors. Again, changes in mini IPSC frequency and paired-pulses ratios suggested a presynaptic mode of action (Cooper and Stanford, 2001). DA or D2 agonists reduced evoked IPSCs in striatal medium spiny neurons in wild type, but not D2 knock-out mice. Furthermore, the depression of evoked IPSCs was also observed following release of DA by amphetamine, and this amphetamine-induced depression of IPSCs was blocked by a D2 antagonist (Centonze et al., 2001).

In striatal cholinergic interneurons, DA via D2 receptors reduced evoked IPSCs and mini IPSC frequency through a presynaptic action that was mediated by inhibition of presynaptic N-type Ca²⁺ channels (Momiyama and Koga, 2001). In these cholinergic interneurons, Pisani et al. (2000) also showed that D2 agonists decreased evoked IPSCs via a presynaptic mechanism, while D1 agonists depolarized these interneurons without affecting evoked IPSC amplitude directly. In spite of this lack of a D1/5 agonist effect on evoked IPSCs onto cholinergic interneurons as reported by Pisani et al. (2000), Yan and Surmeier (1997) reported that D5 receptor stimulation enhanced a zinc-sensitive GABA current postsynaptically in dissociated striatal cholinergic interneurons. In fast-spiking striatal GABAergic interneurons, D1 agonists directly depolarized, while a D2 agonist decreased evoked IPSCs through a presumably presynaptic action (Bracci et al., 2002).

In primary cultured medium spiny neurons from the nucleus accumbens (ventral striatum), a D1 agonist increased, while a D2 agonist decreased, the autaptic IPSCs (Joyce and Rayport, 2000). However, in dissociated striatal medium spiny neurons, Flores-Hernandez et al. (2000) reported that D1 receptor stimulation reduced the postsynaptic GABA current. They also noted that while low concentrations (~1 μM) of agonist decreased the postsynaptic GABA current “preliminary experiments using higher concentrations of the D1 DA receptor agonist SKF81297 (10 μM) … have revealed an enhancement of GABA-evoked currents in medium spiny neurons” (p. 3000). This may therefore be another example where different concentrations of D1 agonist produce opposing effects (FEATURE #1). Taken together, data obtained from striatal neurons suggest that DA acts via D1 receptors to depolarize GABAergic interneurons directly, yet acts presynaptically via D2 receptors to inhibit GABA release onto dorsal and ventral striatal medium spiny output neurons, cholinergic interneurons and fast-spiking (GABAergic) interneurons.

### 9.3. DA modulation of spontaneous and synaptically evoked GABAergic responses in PFC pyramidal neurons

In PFC, bath application of D2/D4 agonists decrease evoked IPSCs almost immediately, while D1 agonists

in accumbens neuron firing was revealed only after blockade  
of D1 receptors. It appears that within the PFC, nucleus  
accumbens and hippocampus, DA appears to be capable of  
evoking a biphasic modulation of a field PSP or IPSC via D1  
and D2 receptors (FEATURE #13; Gribkoff and Ashe, 1984;  
Seamans et al., 2001b).

---

**FEATURE #13: DA modulation of GABAergic  
responses in pyramidal neurons can be biphasic with an initial D2 mediated reduction followed by a prolonged D1-mediated increase.**

DA appears to act through diverse cellular mechanisms to  
modulate inhibition. In PFC neurons, Penit-Soria et al.  
(1987) first showed that a high concentration (400 μM) of  
DA increased spontaneous IPSPs in layer V–VI neurons in  
PFC slices, suggesting that DA could increase action potential dependent release of GABA. Subsequently Law-Tho et  
al. (1994) showed that DA depressed pharmacologically  
isolated IPSPs evoked by an extracellular stimulating electrode. These two studies provide the first example that DA  
might differentially modulate spontaneous and evoked  
IPSPs, in spite of the fact that both are largely dependent  
on action potential mediated release of GABA, and hence,  
theoretically should share common presynaptic release  
machineries.

In layer I–II PFC neurons, Zhou and Hablitz (1999) also  
observed that DA increases spontaneous sIPSC frequency  
and amplitude. In spite of the increase in sIPSC amplitude, a  
subsequent study by this group (Gonzalez-Islas and Hablitz,  
2001) and others (layer V–VI; Seamans et al., 2001b)  
showed that DA reduced evoked IPSC amplitude. The latter  
effect was also observed by Gao and Goldman-Rakic  
(2003b) using interneuron-pyramidal cell-pair recordings  
from ferret PFC neurons. However, the DA mediated IPSP  
reduction in pyramidal neurons was only for fast-spiking  
interneuron to pyramidal connections and not non-fast-  
spiking interneuron to pyramidal connections. Like the issue  
made earlier for the diverse discrepancies in spontaneous,  
paired cell and evoked EPSCs (FEATURE #4), the best  
explanation for this difference is that the evoked IPSCs  
produced by a stimulating electrode were due to release of  
GABA from selected fibers whereas multiple divergent  
inputs produced spontaneous IPSCs. Thus in PFC, the effect  
of DA on IPSCs may depend on the type of neuron investigated, and more importantly, the origin of the terminals  
producing the IPSC in a given neuron.

### 9.4. Layer specificity of D1 versus D2-mediated  
GABAergic responses in PFC pyramidal neurons

There is evidence for both D1 and D2/D4-mediated  
reduction of of IPSCs in the PFC (Gonzalez-Islas and  
Hablitz, 2001; Gao and Goldman-Rakic, 2003b; Seamans  
et al., 2001b; Wang et al., 2002b). One difference between  
these studies is that Gonzalez-Islas and Hablitz recorded  
from predominately layer II neurons while other studies  
investigated deep layer V–VI neurons. While the difference  
in layer II versus layer V cells may seem trivial, the  
anatomical differences in these regions from the perspective  
of DA innervation, are considerable (see Berger et al., 1991;  
Yang et al., 1999a) and could account for some of the  
electrophysiological differences.

Unlike the primate that expresses DA markers in superficial layers of PFC, D1 and D2 subtypes and DA afferents to rat PFC are mainly found in deeper layers (Berger et al., 1991; Davidoff and Benes, 1998; Descarries et al., 1987; Van Eden et al., 1987). Furthermore, the sparse DA terminals in superficial layers have lower DA content, higher metabolic rate and are less activated by stress (Berger et al., 1991). The mRNA for DA receptors is expressed most strongly in layer V neurons across species (Lidow et al., 1998; Gaspar et al., 1995). However, in rats while D1 mRNA was found mainly in layer V with some expression in layer II, D2 receptor mRNA and immunoreactivity was restricted exclusively to layer V and was absent in superficial layers (Vincent et al., 1995; Al-Tikriti et al., 1992; Gaspar et al., 1995; Bouthenet et al., 1991; see review by Yang et al., 1999a on species differences of PFC DA inputs). The lack of D2 receptors in superficial layers explains why D2 agonists had no effect on layer II neurons in the study of Gonzalez-Islas and Hablitz (2001). This is consistent with in vivo electrophysiological data showing that the DA-mediated depression of spontaneous activity is blocked by a D2 antagonist only if the recorded neuron is located in deep and not superficial layers (Sesack and Bunney, 1989). Here again is another important piece of evidence suggesting that the layer the neuron is located and its afferents impact the end result of DA modulation (FEATURE #4). Since individual PFC neurons express different levels of D1 and D2 receptor markers, this may explain the inconsistencies in individual results.

As suggested by FEATURE #4 not all subtypes of neurons within a layer are modulated in an equivalent manner by DA. Recent data suggest that DA is able to depolarize predominately fast-spiking interneurons, yet has little effect on other subtypes of interneurons found in rat PFC (Fig. 8; Gorelova et al., 2002). Moreover, the depolarization and increased excitability of fast-spiking interneurons by DA is mediated by D1 receptors. Various interneurons control pyramidal cell excitability in different manners. For instance, fast-spiking interneurons synapse near the spike initiation zone and may directly regulate spike initiation and timing whereas late-spiking interneurons are vertically oriented and control dendritic excitability (Kawaguchi, 1993, 1995). Differential regulation of fast- spiking and late-spiking excitability or connections to pyramidal neurons would exert differential effects on PFC networks (Gao and Goldman-Rakic, 2003b). The same may hold for different types of horizontally projecting

by D1 receptors (Gorelova et al., 2002). In contrast, a D1 agonist alone induced a more delayed and very prolonged membrane depolarization that often failed to wash out (Gorelova et al., 2002).

Of even greater interest was the observation that DA had different duration effects on the same interneuron via D1 receptors. As shown in Fig. 8, DA exerted a D1 dependent depolarization of FS interneurons and a simultaneous increase in interneuronal excitability. However, for the same application of DA and in the same interneuron, the depolarization lasted less than 10 minutes after application while the increase in evoked firing lasted >40 min (Fig. 8; Gorelova et al., 2002). Since these two actions are dependent on DA modulation of different K⁺ currents (Gorelova et al., 2002), these data raise the interesting possibility that DA can act through the same receptor to modulate different ionic currents on different time scales to produce the different durations of changes in neuronal excitability versus membrane depolarization.

In addition, the long-lasting D1-mediated effects (Figs. 7 and 8) could be truncated by D2 receptors. Accordingly, a D2 agonist applied at the peak of the D1-mediated increase in IPSCs could reverse the increase and produce a decrease in IPSC amplitude (Seamans et al., 2001b). A similar reversal of the D1-mediated depolarization of interneurons by subsequent application of a D2 agonist has also been observed (Gorelova et al., 2002). These data suggest that D2/D4 receptor stimulation may truncate D1-mediated effects in time. Since Zheng et al. (1999) have shown that only higher concentrations of DA activate D2 receptors to suppress synaptic currents, it is possible that long-lasting D1 receptor mediated effects might be reversed by a transient but high concentration of DA that activates D2 receptors (FEATURE #13).

interneurons, which may control excitability within versus between columns. Preferential modulation of these interneurons in defined PFC microcircuits by DA might allow greater or lesser activation between and within “memory fields” (Goldman-Rakic et al., 2000; Rao et al., 2000; Constantinidis et al., 2002).

### 9.5. Temporal profile of D1 and D2 effects differ on PFC GABAergic interneurons

A potentially interesting feature of DA modulation was revealed with regards to DA modulation of PFC interneurons. In GABA fast-spiking interneurons, D1 but not D2 agonists depolarize the membrane and modulate interneuron excitability (Gorelova et al., 2002). Evidence reviewed earlier suggests that DA might act on different time scales via different receptors to modulate excitability (Gulledge and Jaffe, 1998, 2001), field responses (Fig. 4) or IPSCs (Fig. 7). However, the depolarization of fast-spiking GABAergic interneurons also has a different temporal profile depending on whether it is induced by DA, or by a D1 agonist even though both effects are D1 receptor mediated: DA promptly depolarizes fast-spiking interneurons and this depolarization returns to baseline a few minutes after DA has washed out (Fig. 8). This DA effect is blocked completely by co-application of a D1 antagonist, indicating it is mediated

### 9.6. Direct DA modulation of postsynaptic $GABA_{A}$ receptors

While DA modulation of GABAergic responses in pyramidal neurons can occur presynaptically (either due to increasing the excitability of interneurons via D1 receptors to increase GABA release, or via D2 receptors to depress release of GABA), postsynaptic DA modulation of $GABA_{A}$ receptors on pyramidal neurons might also occur. Postsynaptic $GABA_{A}$ receptors and their different subunit compositions on different pyramidal neurons can be modulated differentially by several types of protein kinases that are potential targets of DA receptors (Nusser et al., 1999). PKA phosphorylation of β3 subunit-containing $GABA_{A}$ receptors at two sites enhanced the GABA-activated response, whereas phosphorylation at a single Ser-409 site of β1 subunit containing receptors produced an inhibition of the GABA response (McDonald et al., 1998). In contrast, PKC phosphorylation of the β1 subunit has been found to cause a reduction in the amplitudes of GABA-activated currents (Krishek et al., 1994). There also appears to be a basal level

of PKC-dependent phosphorylation of GABA receptors that decreases their activity (Brandon et al., 2000). Evidence for differential PKA and PKC induced regulation of GABA responses has been observed in different hippocampal neurons (Poisbeau et al., 1999). Any receptor receptor that can activate PKC and PKA signaling pathways, may therefore differentially regulate $GABAA$ receptor function. As noted earlier, DA acts via both PKA and PKC/Calcyon (Bergson et al., 2003; Lezcano and Bergson, 2002; Jin et al., 2001) signaling pathways. Further work is required to determine whether differential activation of protein kinases by DA is able to differentially affect postsynaptic GABA receptor function.

FEATURE #14: The effects of a neuromodulator on GABAergic responses depends on the subunit composition of the receptor, the amount of agonist, and the endogenous constitutively active levels of intracellular signaling molecules, such as PKA and PKC.

Fig. 9. A summary schematic showing that DA acts through D1 and D2 receptors to exert diverse actions on PFC pyramidal and interneurons. D1-mediated effects include an increase in NMDA currents, a decrease in glutamate release, an increase in interneuron excitability and IPSC amplitude in pyramidal cells, a leftward shift in $I_{\text{NaP}}$ activation and a reduction in the IK+ current. D2-mediated effects include a reduction of IPSCs onto pyramidal cells, as well as reduced NMDA currents and spiking (not shown).

### 9.7. Functional implications of DA modulation of GABA interneurons

The overall effects of DA modulation of GABAergic inputs to pyramidal cells may contribute to critical changes in the computational properties of PFC circuits. The implications of such changes to working memory circuits will be discussed further. DA modulation of interneurons per se could however produce other diverse effects. Given that dynamic GABAergic feedforward and feedback inhibition of pyramidal neurons can regulate timing of spike coding, membrane oscillation frequencies, network synchronization, ion channel activation kinetics, dendritic signaling and synaptic plasticity (Cobb et al., 1995; Miles et al., 1996; Kanter et al., 1996; Kanter and Haberly, 1993; Tsu-bokawa and Ross, 1996; Tamás et al., 1998; Fricker and Miles, 2002; Galarreta and Hestrin, 2001; Gonchar and Burkhalter, 2003), DA activation of GABAergic interneurons that innervate the perisomatic region of pyramidal neurons may; (a) synchronize firing patterns and phase-lock activity of interneurons (Cobb et al., 1995; Whittington et al., 1995; Whittington and Traub, 2003; Jeffreys et al., 1996; Kawaguchi, 2001); or (b) inter-pose IPSPs between repetitive spike firing of pyramidal neurons in order to restructure their temporal pattern of firing without changing the mean firing rate. Indeed, simultaneous multi-unit recordings from monkey PFC or cortical neurons performing memory tasks have shown that the memory encoding is accomplished by a restructuring of firing patterns without changing the overall mean firing rate (Abeles et al., 1993; Vaadia et al., 1995; de Charms and Merzenich, 1996).

### 10. Summary of the biophysical actions of DA in PFC neurons in vitro

The preceding sections reviewed the known properties of DA modulation of the basic physiology of single PFC neurons. The main published actions of DA are summarized in Fig. 9. Although certain aspects of these data remain controversial, it is evident that DA has diverse and competing influences on PFC neurons via both D1 and D2 receptors on pyramidal cells and interneurons. It is difficult to come up with a coherent picture of what DA is doing in the PFC based simply on a summary of these individual effects. Therefore, sections to follow will focus on the summed effects of physiologically released DA in intact PFC networks.

### 11. DA modulation of PFC neurons in vivo

There is a long history of studies (partially summarized in Table 1) showing that in vivo, DA exerts a predominately ‘inhibitory’ (specifically, spontaneous spike firing suppression) effect on excitability of single pyramidal cells recorded extracellularly (Pirot et al., 1992; Mantz et al., 1992; Sesack and Bunney, 1989; Ferron et al., 1984; Godbout et al., 1991; Bunney and Aghajanian, 1976; Mora et al., 1976). In these studies, DA was applied in several ways: (a) by local iontophoresis; (b) by microinjection of DA next to the recorded PFC cell; or (c) synaptically via VTA stimulation.

11.1. Spontaneous spike firing suppression by DA: D1 or D2 mediated?

Local iontophoretic application of DA decreased the spontaneous firing of PFC neurons and this spike suppression was reduced by a D2, but generally not a D1 antagonist (Sesack and Bunney, 1989; Parfitt et al., 1990; Pirot et al., 1992). Accordingly, D2 agonists were more effective than D1 agonists in replicating the DA-mediated inhibition of spontaneous firing (Thierry et al., 1998). On the other hand, Sesack and Bunney (1989) found that iontophoretic application of a D2 agonist directly onto single PFC neurons in vivo failed to mimic the DA-mediated firing suppression.

As in the in vitro preparation, the differential actions of DA on D1 and D2 receptors may be concentration dependent (FEATURE #6). Williams and Millar (1990a) recorded unit activity and DA concentration in a time-sharing manner from the same carbon fiber electrode in the striatum and examined the simultaneous effect of medial forebrain bundle (MFB) stimulation on DA levels and firing. They observed that MFB stimulation that evoked DA levels between 35 and 240 nM significantly increased the firing activity of putative medium spiny neurons (Fig. 10). If the duration of MFB stimulation was increased and DA levels rose further to ~340 nM, the period of excitation decreased in duration and was followed by inhibition. When MFB stimulation was increased further to evoke low μM DA levels, the firing rate of the neurons decreased. This response pattern, from an increase in firing to a decrease with varying levels of DA, was observed in single neurons. It is also of interest to note that the effect of the evoked DA release on firing far outlasted the period of stimulation (Fig. 10), sometimes lasting as long as 360 s after a <1 s long stimulation. These findings therefore provide another example of how DA can exert long-lasting physiological effects long after it has been cleared (FEATURE #5), even in the striatum where fast DA reuptake kinetics are present.

A similar dose-dependence to DA effects in vivo can be found in Floresco et al. (2001a) who also combined electrochemistry and extracellular single-unit electrophysiology. They observed that burst stimulation of the ventral subiculum of the hippocampus produced an initial decrease followed by an increase in local extracellular DA levels to ~250 nM in the nucleus accumbens, independent of the VTA DA input. This amount of glutamatergic hippocampal-stimulated release of DA in the accumbens increased the evoked firing of nucleus accumbens neurons. Floresco et al. (2001a, 2001b) then showed that the increase in evoked firing was blocked by administration of a D1 antagonist. However, in the presence of the D1 antagonist, a decreased excitability of nucleus accumbens neurons was observed and this was removed by a D2 antagonist. This result implies that D1 and D2 receptors are stimulated by the same amount of DA but act antagonistically, and these data therefore nicely parallel the findings of West and Grace (2002) in striatum. If these results can be generalized to PFC, it may also imply that the nature of the DA is dictated by the relative amount and efficacy of D1 and D2 receptors on a given neuron. This conclusion has significant impact on our understanding of PFC function because it implies that two experimenters could obtain exactly opposite results following bath application of exogenous DA because they randomly chose two neurons with different D1 and D2 receptor distributions.

Other studies have produced similar results, while providing insights into the receptor subtypes producing the facilitation versus suppression in firing. DA or a D1 agonist applied at low iontophoretic currents (1–5 nA) facilitated the glutamate-evoked firing of caudate neurons recorded extracellularly in vivo (Chiodo and Berger, 1986; Hu and Wang, 1988). Likewise, low concentrations of DA potentiated cholinergic-induced excitation in PFC neurons, recorded extracellularly in vivo (Yang and Mogenson, 1990). In contrast, either higher iontophoretic currents (>10 nA) of DA or a D1 agonist suppressed spontaneous and glutamate- or ACh-evoked firing (Hu and Wang, 1988; Yang and Mogenson, 1990). It is notable that DA at low concentrations (1 μM) can depolarize caudate neurons in brain slices and increase both spontaneous and evoked firing, while at higher concentrations of DA (100–500 μM) it induces an opposite

![Figure 10](#fig10)

Fig. 10. Effect of varying the physiologically released DA level on firing in striatum. (A) Low intensity stimulation evoked a small increase in DA locally recorded using amperometry from a carbon fiber electrode. This increase in DA produced an increase in spiking recorded from the same carbon fiber electrode that far outlasted the rise in DA. Moderate intensity stimulation increased DA levels further but had little effect on spiking. Higher intensity stimulation evoked μM levels of extrasynaptic DA that completely inhibited firing.

effect by suppressing spontaneous and evoked spiking (Akaike et al., 1987). The spike facilitating effect of low concentrations of DA was blocked by a D2 antagonist while the suppressive effect of high doses of DA was blocked by a D1 antagonist (Akaike et al., 1987). It was suggested that these differences were due to opposing actions of DA on adenylate cyclase activity as >40 μM DA was needed to increase adenylate cyclase levels while <1 μM decreased them in vitro (Akaiki et al., 1987; Cooper et al., 1986; Stoof and Kebabian, 1981). Therefore, like in the findings of in vitro studies, these in vivo studies demonstrate that DA can exert exactly opposite effects on a physiological measure not only via activation of a single receptor (FEATURE #1) but also via differential activation of D1 versus D2 receptors (FEATURE #12) at different concentrations of DA (FEATURE #6). Many other examples of this type of bidirectionality of DA in non-neuronal tissue are summarized by Calabrese (2001).

### 11.2. Spontaneous spike firing suppression by DA and GABA in PFC: the importance of DA 'tone'

The DA modulation of excitability in PFC neurons also appears to depend on GABA activation. Pirot et al. (1992) showed that the GABA antagonist, bicuculline blocked the iontophoretic DA- and VTA-mediated inhibition of spontaneous firing in 57 and 51% of cells, respectively. Moreover, a D2 antagonist reduced the DA-mediated and VTA stimulation-induced inhibition of spontaneous firing in PFC in 89 and 54% of cells, respectively (Table 4). Furthermore, depleting DA stores by pre-treatment with α-methly-p-tyrosine reduced the number of cells inhibited by VTA stimulation to 39% and in this subset of cells the VTA-induced inhibition was no longer influenced by sulpiride (a D2 antagonist) but was blocked by bicuculline. This study therefore showed that there is both a GABA-dependent and GABA-independent component to the DA and VTA-induced inhibition of PFC neurons.

If GABA is such a key player that mediates DA effects in PFC, why have so many studies shown that the VTA-induced firing suppression in PFC neurons can be eliminated by D2 antagonists (Pirot et al., 1992; Mantz et al., 1992; Ferron et al., 1984; Godbout et al., 1991; Bunney and Aghajanian, 1976; Mora et al., 1976)? We think the answer to this question is that the DA system primarily provides a tone or chemical milieu in PFC and that this tone directly influences PFC physiology likely via ‘volume transmission’ (Zoli et al., 1998). It is clear from in vivo microdialysis data that there are tonic levels of DA in the striatum and PFC (0.3–15 nM) (Ihalainen et al., 1999; Garris et al., 1993; Garris and Wightman, 1994; Shoblock et al., 2003; Devoto et al., 2001; Izaki et al., 1998; Hildebrand et al., 1998; Hernandez and Hoebel, 1995). These values are based largely on studies in anesthetized animals where there is little VTA activity. However, levels of DA can rise into the range of hundreds to thousands of nM, even with modest

stimulation of the midbrain or median forebrain bundle (Garris et al., 1994).

This DA ‘tone’ functionally modulates excitability of neurons (Trantham et al., 2002; West and Grace, 2002) rather than encoding fast precise information. DA does not generally produce a direct change in membrane voltage in the form of EPSP or IPSP in neurons of PFC or elsewhere. Nevertheless, stimulation of the VTA consistently evokes a fast EPSP–IPSP sequence in the frontal cortex (Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000; Mercuri et al., 1985). This EPSP–IPSP sequence remains after DA receptor blockade and the IPSP has the physiological properties consistent with those of GABAA receptors (Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000; Lavin et al., 2002; Fig. 11).

If single-pulse VTA stimulation evoked an IPSP that inhibits pyramidal cell firing for ~120 ms, it is clear why Pirot et al. (1992) reported such a profound effect on reversal of firing inhibition by bicuculline. But why is this inhibition also removed by a D2 antagonist in many cells? As noted earlier, because D2 receptors tonically inhibit excitability (West and Grace, 2002; Trantham et al., 2002; Rubinstein et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2003), a D2 class (e.g. D4 receptor, Wang et al., 2003; Cépeda et al., 2001; Rubinstein et al., 2001) receptor antagonist can also remove this tonic inhibition so that the neurons become sufficiently active to fire throughout the normal period of inhibition produced by VTA stimulation (Trantham et al., 2002). By changing the tonic excitability of PFC neurons, a D2 antagonist can remove the inhibition without invoking the notion that the VTA-induced phasic release of DA has a direct inhibitory effect. The reported 120 ms VTA-induced inhibition of PFC firing is orders of magnitude faster than any DA effect observed in vitro. Therefore, reversal of the fast VTA-induced inhibition by a D2 antagonist does not imply that such inhibition is mediated by a fast D2-mediated effect. Rather, we assert that because the entire physiology of the PFC changes when the D2 tone is eliminated, removal of this tone makes PFC neurons fire more, thereby occluding the IPSP that is produced by VTA stimulation (Fig. 11).

Collectively, three conclusions can be drawn regarding the spike firing suppression effect of DA or VTA stimulation: (1) much of the spontaneous spike firing suppression produced by VTA stimulation is due to GABA release that induces inhibition of firing with an onset latency of ~15–20 ms and that delays firing for ~120 ms; (2) blocking D2 tone via an as yet unclear mechanism(s) greatly impacts tonic excitability; (3) the increased excitability produced by blockade of tonic D2 stimulation can occlude the effects of inhibitory inputs (FEATURE #15).

**FEATURE #15:** Tonic DA on DA receptors provides a ‘tone’ that exerts strong effects on the physiology of PFC neurons. It therefore does not follow that the inhibition in firing produced by VTA stimulation is mediated by phasic DA

release from the stimulation. When DA tone on D2 receptors is removed by a D2 antagonist the entire physiology of the neuron and network changes and this change in the basal physiology of PFC neurons influences the response to VTA (and likely any other) input.

It is also important to note that the background DA ‘tone’ may complicate the extension of in vitro results to the in vivo situation. Undoubtedly, there are differences between DA ‘tone’ in in vivo studies versus in vitro studies. In vivo, the extrasyaptic levels of basal DA are in the nM range in the striatum and reach ~500 nM for <100 ms following MFB stimulation (Gonon, 1997; Gonon and Buda, 1985). These levels of DA in vivo would likely stimulate both D1 and D2 receptors. For in vitro studies, there is less intrinsic DA tone since impulse conducting DA inputs are severed during slice preparation and the tissue is constantly being washed in perfusate. A complete removal of endogenous DA ‘tone’ in striatum by 6OHDA depletion has been shown to lead to: (1) an increase in neuronal excitability; (2) an increased efficacy of glutamatergic inputs to the striatum; and (3) supersensitivity of D2 DA receptors and reduced inhibitory influence of D1 receptors postsynaptically (Calabresi et al., 1993, 1988a, 1988b). The diverse levels of tonic endogenous DA that remain in the slices may lead investigators to observe results that are very different from each other. Therefore, without knowing the exact tonic endogenous DA concentrations in vitro one must be cautious when extrapolating from a single piece of in vitro data to predict what DA effects will be in vivo.

### 11.3. Summary of the effects of DA on spiking in vivo

Exogenous DA or DA released from terminals in the PFC exerts a complex modulation of spontaneous firing in vivo. The regulation appears to depend on endogenous DA ‘tone’,

![Figure 11](attachment://image.png)

Fig. 11. Effect of VTA stimulation on PFC neurons. (Left) An in vivo intracellular recording of a PFC neuron illustrates that the PFC neuron responds with a fast EPSP–IPSP sequence to stimulation of the VTA (figure courtesy A. Lavin). (Right) In an organotypic co-culture containing the VTA and PFC (see Seamans et al., 2003 for details) VTA stimulation (in the presence of an NMDA antagonist CPP, 10 μM to prevent ‘up’ states) caused a delay in spiking during the period of the IPSP.
the amount of evoked DA released, the receptor subtype involved and the heterogeneity of the VTA response. The electrophysiological response of PFC neurons to single-pulse direct VTA stimulation is a fast EPSP–IPSP sequence and this is responsible for changes in excitability immediately following a VTA pulse. Since the EPSP–IPSP sequence is not evoked by direct DA application in vivo or in vitro, and such a fast synaptic response is not typical for DA receptors, then perhaps VTA stimulation resulted in more than DA or GABA efflux in the PFC. If this is the case, it has important implications for our understanding of the mesocortical system in both normal and pathological conditions. Therefore, it is of interest to critically re-examine the properties of the VTA → PFC pathway.

Otherwise it would be unclear as to which reward prediction is good or bad, thereby preventing other brain regions from being able to map the “error” signal to a specific stimulus within a reasonably short time for such a ‘realization’ or an internal ‘recognition’ of an error (see also Redgrave et al., 1999). While the properties of stimulation evoked DA release are well in accord with those required for DA neurons to encode a prediction error signal, the properties of DA release at the terminal fields in PFC during behavior, are often not.

### 12. What does dopaminergic VTA → PFC cell firing encode?

Midbrain DA neurons fire in regular single spikes and in occasional phasic bursts, which are regulated by diverse afferents in vivo (Grace and Bunney, 1983, 1984; Grace, 2002; Kosobud et al., 1994; Overton and Clark, 1997; Floresco et al., 2003). Primate midbrain DA neurons in the VTA respond in short phasic bursts to appetitive or novel stimuli (Romo and Schultz, 1990) (i.e. burst is defined as spike firing with an interspike interval of 50–110 ms and for a duration of <200 ms). As summarized by Schultz (1997, 1998), midbrain DA neurons respond to primary rewards, conditioned or secondary rewards (cell response transfers from primary reward to secondary reward during learning), rewards that are not predicted (Hollerman and Schultz, 1998), associated but non-rewarded stimuli (e.g. non-rewarded cues randomly alternated on ‘go’–‘no go’ tasks), novel or unexpected stimuli, aversive stimuli (see further), and non-conditioned stimuli that are similar to a CS (transiently respond then show a decrease in firing).

Such response properties were interpreted initially to suggest that DA neurons respond to “salience” in that they signal stimuli of high priority to the organism without specifying the details of the stimulus (Schultz, 1997). But according to Schultz (1998) “DA neurons are activated by rewarding events that are better than predicted, remain unaffected by events that are as good as predicted, and are depressed by events that are worse than predicted”. In this way, the firing of DA neurons and release of DA may generate ‘a prediction error about rewards’ (Schultz, 1998; Schultz et al., 1997). Currently, it is not known whether the primate VTA DA neurons recorded represent the mesocortical VTA → PFC DA neurons or whether such ‘prediction error’ signals are actually processed elsewhere in the brain (Garavan et al., 2002; Swick and Turken, 2002), and then relayed to excite VTA DA neurons.

In order for the DA signal to act as an effective prediction error signal, its effects must be temporally precise relative to the processing of rewarding stimuli and associated events.

### 12.1. Regulation and kinetic properties of evoked release of DA

The proposed ‘prediction error’ model relies heavily on the firing properties of midbrain DA neurons. Matching neuronal activity in the DA terminal regions as a result of this DA cell firing activity is equally important. Below, we will briefly summarize the properties of evoked DA release. Numerous studies have investigated the kinetics of DA release in the striatum and PFC in anesthetized animals or acute brain slices using fast scan voltametry or amperometry. A variety of stimulation frequencies, intensities and stimulus durations have been employed. For comparison, DA neurons in freely-moving rats typically fire in the 2–7 Hz range spontaneously, with bursts in the 14–20 Hz range (Freeman et al., 1985; Kiyatkin, 1988, 1995).

In the striatum, DA fibers make en passant synapses every ~4 μm (Pickel et al., 1981), and as noted earlier, basal levels of DA are in the tens of nM range while stimulation-evoked efflux is in the low μM range (Garris et al., 1994; Gonon, 1997; Hertel et al., 1999; Wightman and Zimmerman, 1990; Chergui et al., 1994; Kawagoe et al., 1992). In these regions, the half-life of DA is ~75 ms or less (Wightman and Zimmerman, 1990; Garris et al., 1994), allowing DA to diffuse up to 12 μm from a release site (Gonon, 1997).

The amount and duration of DA release is dependent on the frequency and duration of the stimulation of DA neurons or axons. In anesthetized rats, medial forebrain bundle (MFB) stimulation at <30 Hz (120 pulses) produces an increase in DA levels in the nucleus accumbens that peaked at <500 nM and decayed to baseline within a few seconds, while MFB stimulation at >40 Hz evoked DA release in the low μM range and decayed back to baseline also within a few seconds after stimulus offset (Wightman and Zimmerman, 1990; Chergui et al., 1994). In both the accumbens and striatum 10 Hz stimulation causes DA levels to rise to a plateau of ~200 nM during the stimulation period while 60 Hz stimulation causes DA levels to rise during the entire stimulation period and peak at 1–15 μM, depending on the stimulation duration and intensity (Kawagoe et al., 1992; Wightman and Zimmerman, 1990). Calculated diffusion coefficients in striatum are 6 × 10⁻⁶ cm²/s and disappearance rates are approximately 1–4 μM/s (Kawagoe et al., 1992; Garris et al., 1994).There appears to be differences in the striatal and mesocortico-limbic DA systems. Using the same methodology across regions, Garris et al. (1993) determined that the tissue content of DA in the PFC is about 100-fold less than that in the striatum yet evoked release was only 5-fold less. Mesocortical DA terminals can sustain release levels for much longer periods than other DA terminal fields, even after synthesis inhibition (Garris et al., 1993; Cass and Gerhardt, 1995; Wayment et al., 2001). This may reflect an increased rate of DA synthesis or reduced metabolism in mesofrontal DA neurons (Bannon et al., 1981; Bannon et al., 1983; Bannon and Roth, 1983; Hoffman et al., 1988). There also appears to be lower levels of activity of the synthesis-modulating D2 type autoreceptors in the mesofrontal DA neuron terminals (Bannon et al., 1983; but see Galloway et al., 1986).

In limbic regions such as the basolateral amygdala and PFC DA clearance rates are slower than in the striatum (Cass and Gerhardt, 1995; Garris et al., 1993, 1994). In PFC, a 60 Hz/2 s stimulation evoked a maximal recorded DA concentration of 2.4 μM, with lower frequencies stimulation (30 Hz/120 pulses) evoking ~200 nM (Garris et al., 1993). Decay of DA levels back to baseline in PFC typically took longer than 5 s while higher concentrations (1.2 μM) of exogenously applied DA decayed away over tens of seconds (Garris et al., 1993; Cass and Gerhardt, 1995). In PFC slices, DA levels evoked by a 30 Hz/30 pulse focal stimulation were 320 nM and this decayed over a period greater than 5 s (Mundorf et al., 2001). Unlike striatal regions, there are very low levels of DA transporter expression in PFC (Sesack et al., 1998a), and the DA transporter accounts for only ~40% of DA uptake in PFC, compared with ~95% in striatum (Wayment et al., 2001). Unlike striatum, a significant portion of PFC DA uptake is mediated by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and catabolized enzymatically by COMT, more so than by MAO (Cass and Gerhardt, 1995; Wayment et al., 2001; Moron et al., 2002; Bymaster et al., 2002).

Recently, Carelli (2002) and Phillips et al. (2003) used fast voltammetric detection of DA oxidation signal in the nucleus accumbens of a behaving animal during a drug-seeking paradigm. DA transients of 65 nM were observed upon responding for cocaine that returned to baseline about 5 s after a response, while cues previously paired with drug taking evoked a peak DA response of 94 nM that decayed in 5.7 s from cue onset (Phillips et al., 2003). Drug seeking behaviors could also be initiated by electrical VTA stimulation to evoke accumbens DA release on these short time-scales. This study in awake animals, like previous studies in anesthetized animals, provides strong evidence that a fast phasic DA release occurs in the mesolimbic pathway. The question then becomes, what is responding to these DA signals?

### 12.2. Correlative neuronal responses to simultaneous fast measurement of evoked DA release

Only a few studies used high temporal resolution voltammetric measurement of DA signals simultaneously with electrophysiological recordings of postsynaptic electrophysiological response (Gonon, 1997; Williams and Millar, 1990a). In anesthetized rats, trains of MFB stimulation at 15 Hz produced an increase in striatal DA levels in vivo that peaked at ~300 nM and returned to baseline in a few hundred milliseconds. There was a simultaneous increase in spiking of striatal units that lasted <1 s after the MFB burst and the response was blocked by a D1 antagonist (Gonon, 1997). As discussed above and in more detail below, examining changes in excitability in the few hundred milliseconds after stimulation is problematic because substantia nigra, VTA or MFB stimulation always evokes a PSP in this period that does not appear to be DA-mediated. Thus, as noted in FEATURE #15, a transient increase in firing cannot necessarily be attributable to a transient stimulus-dependent D1 receptor mediated increase in firing. Like the argument made earlier for removal of D2 tone by iontophoresis of a D2 antagonist, blockade of D1 receptors in Gonon (1997) may have changed the responsiveness of striatal units tonically, such that when a signal arrived, the units were less excitable.

Williams and Millar (1990a) showed that if MFB stimulation increased DA levels to 35 and 240 nM, a significant increase in the firing activity of putative medium spiny neurons was observed (Fig. 10). If the stimulation evoked low μM DA levels, the firing rate of the neurons decreased. In this study, they tracked the changes in single-unit activity for hundreds of seconds after the stimulation to the MFB (with changes in excitability observed 300 s after MFB stimulation in some cases), long after the typical fast PSP is over.

In PFC, Au-Young et al. (1999) have shown in vivo that the temporal structure of the spontaneous firing pattern, but not the mean firing rate, of antidromically identified PFC → VTA neurons were altered significantly by burst stimulation

---

**FEATURE #16: The mesocortical DA system has much slower kinetics than the nigrostriatal DA system.**

The above studies showed that the DA synapse is capable of producing a localized rise in DA concentrations in the anesthetized animal that decays to basal levels in a matter of milliseconds to seconds. The region affected by the localized DA release is determined by diffusional kinetics and uptake. With these in mind, one can expect that within PFC where there is little uptake, DA may diffuse a considerable distance from the release site over a period of seconds. The release events are less localized in PFC than in striatum but the DA landscape in PFC is not homogenous, and thus PFC DA levels can fluctuate in space and time.
of the VTA (delivered at 10–15 Hz) that mimicked burst firing of VTA DA cells. A similar but much longer lasting effect has been recently observed in PFC. Nogueira et al. (2003) found that transient burst stimulation of the VTA (20 Hz/2 s) increases the spike firing evoked by depolarizing pulses in intracellularly recorded PFC neurons in vivo. This effect was D1 receptor-dependent (i.e., sensitive to SCH23390 blockade). Remarkably, the increase in evoked neuronal excitability lasted for tens of minutes after VTA burst offset similar the prolonged effects following DA or D1 agonist application in PFC slice studies. Therefore, it appears that there are fast stimulation-dependent changes in DA release, but to our knowledge, there is little evidence to show an electrophysiologically measurable transient of this phasic DA release.

### 12.3. VTA firing versus PFC DA release: a good match?

In awake behaving animals the temporal profile of DA release is slow relative to electrically-evoked release in anesthetized preparations. Microdialysis analyses of DA levels during behavior are consistent with the idea of a DA ‘tone’ (Grace, 1991). In response to behavioral stimuli, extrasynaptic DA levels typically rise slowly to a plateau level and upon reaching this plateau, slowly return to baseline. A positive event such as delivery of food to a hungry rat potently increases DA levels in PFC (Fig. 12; Phillips et al., 2004; Taber and Fibiger, 1997; Wilson et al., 1995). What is remarkable is that a single food pellet can increase PFC DA for ~30 min (Feenstra and Botterblom, 1996). Light handling or novelty (i.e., being placed in a new cage) also

increased PFC DA for 30–50 min, even after all behavioral reactions to the new environment were long since abated (Feenstra and Botterblom, 1995; Feenstra et al., 2000; Feenstra and Botterblom, 1996).

Negative events also increase PFC DA levels. Note that in the experiment shown in Fig. 3, well-trained rats expected food on the maze, yet on the probe trial with no food, DA levels rose to levels comparable to those observed on previous food trials. According to the ‘prediction error’ model of DA neurons (Schultz, 1997, 1998), the lack of expected food is a “worse than predicted” event and should decrease DA levels (due to a decrease in DA cell firing). Yet a significant increase was still observed, at least in rats. Furthermore, a noxious stimulus and its removal can potently change midbrain DA cell firing (Hentall et al., 1991) and increase PFC DA levels (Fig. 12). In fact, stress is an especially potent way to evoke PFC DA release (Finlay and Zigmond, 1997). Handling stress can increase DA levels in PFC by upwards of 200% in young rats without affecting glutamate release (Del Arco et al., 2001; Del Arco and Mora, 2001). In rats trained on a conditioned footshock procedure, the CS alone increased DA levels in the PFC for >30 min (Yoshioka et al., 1996). Moreover, both a 30 min continuous tail pressure application and its offset elevated DA (Finlay et al., 1995). The elevation in PFC DA lasted for 30 min after the pressure was turned off. Likewise, DA levels in PFC were elevated for 40 min following two hours of restraint stress (Imperato et al., 1992). Therefore, unlike evoked DA release in anesthetized animals, extrasynaptic DA levels in the PFC of awake behaving animals stay elevated for a prolonged period (FEATURE #17).

difficult to envision how DA could mediate a fast VTA ‘prediction error’ to PFC when the lingering presence of DA is uncorrelated with the valence of the stimuli being processed. Undeniably, in vivo dialysis DA measurement has poor temporal resolution and it cannot detect the fast synaptic DA fluctuations on a millisecond timescale. However, extrasynaptic DA measured with microdialysis may actually reflect functional PFC DA levels because of the known diffusional action of DA (see earlier). This is especially the case at D1 receptors, which are often (if not exclusively) located outside of the synapse (Caille et al., 1996; Yung et al., 1995; Smiley et al., 1994). Hence, it is difficult to envision how extrasyanptic D1 receptors could ‘know’ the difference between large lingering levels of extrasynaptic DA produced by a previously encountered negative stimulus some minutes ago, versus a recently encountered unexpectedly positive stimulus.

Physiological experiments also suggest that postsynaptic PFC neurons do not appear capable of responding on short timescales to changes in DA. As reviewed earlier, in vitro measurements of D1-mediated effects last tens of minutes after agonist application in the case of intrinsic ionic currents (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Gorelova and Yang, 2000; Henze et al., 2000; Gulledge and Jaffe, 2001) and synaptic potentials and currents (Seamans et al., 2001a, 2001b; Yang, 2000; Umemiya and Raymond, 1997; Huang and Kandel, 1995). Similar long-lasting effects of DA or D1 receptor agonists have been reported in vivo (Yang and Mogenson, 1984; Gribkoff and Ashe, 1984; Li et al., 2003; Williams and Millar, 1990b). Thus synaptically released DA can have effects that far outlast its presence. Therefore, the behaviorally evoked background DA levels detected with microdialysis and the postsynaptic effects detected electrophysiologically, do not fit into the temporal constraints of the ‘prediction error’ model of DA, at least in PFC. A behaving animal would encounter too many stimuli of varying valence during a tens of minute period for DA to mediate specific information about discrete rewards. Furthermore, the direction of the change in the DA signal in the PFC is often opposite of that predicted by the ‘prediction error’ hypothesis as highlighted earlier. So what could be the solution to these issues?

12.4. Fitting the properties of terminal DA release into the prediction error framework

At first glance, these properties of the mesocortical DA release measured with microdialysis in behaving animals, do not fit very well with the ‘prediction error’ hypothesis that is primarily based on VTA cell firing. The PFC DA dialysis studies reviewed earlier clearly show that the mesocortical DA system in PFC is activated as effectively by signals encoded by VTA neurons as “worse than predicted” such as stress (Fig. 12) or withholding reward (Fig. 3), as signals encoded as “better than predicted” such as unexpected food or other positive reinforcers. In addition, these studies show that when activated, DA levels remain elevated for minutes (although transient millisecond up and down fluctuations of DA levels may still be present). These properties make it

13. If DA cannot effectively encode fast events in PFC, what does?

Clearly, there is an extensive body of evidence that midbrain DA neurons encode a prediction error prediction signal. Yet, at least in the PFC the DA signal does not match the properties required to transmit this signal. We believe this issue can be circumvented if one assumes that the ‘prediction error’ signal is not transmitted by DA in the mesocortical pathway. One possible candidate is glutamate co-released by the mesocortical VTA neurons. Rather as VTA neurons fire they may encode the prediction error

signal in accordance with single-unit recording data (Schultz et al., 1997) yet transmit this signal via glutamate co-released from VTA terminals in PFC. In this way, the glutamate that is co-released actually transmits the temporally precise information about reward. This hypothesis offloads the burden of DA encoding both fast and slow events and transfers it to the glutamate system that is exquisitely suited to produce transient changes in neural activity. In order for this theory to be valid, there must be clear evidence of glutamate release from VTA neurons. However, the idea of glutamate co-release from DA neurons has a long and controversial history that we will attempt to summarize further.

### 13.1. Anatomical evidence for glutamate co-release in DA neurons

In anatomical studies, Hattori et al. (1991) used anterograde transport of tritiated amino acids from the substantia nigra to the striatum and found labeling in terminals that formed asymmetric synapses (anatomically considered as excitatory or putative glutamatergic). However, given the injections were quite large and encroached on the posterior thalamus, which also projects to the striatum, this may have been sufficient to allow for transneuronal transport of labeled amino acids (Sesack, personal communication; Hattori, 1993). Another observation by Hattori et al. (1991) was that after 6OHDA lesions of the substantia nigra, degenerating terminals were observed in the striatum forming asymmetric synapses. However, striatal neurons lose spines following DA denervation, and the cortical/thalamic terminals that synapse on them are lost as well. It is therefore possible that these authors actually were observing degenerating cortical terminals.

Another possibility is that there may be a subpopulation of VTA cells that are purely glutamatergic and they are destroyed by 6OHDA. Hanley and Bolam (1997) did anterograde nigrostriatal tracing with biotin dextran amine and showed that out of 150 terminals containing tracer, only 3 formed asymmetric synapses, thereby providing evidence against a substantial subpopulation of midbrain neurons possessing presumed glutamatergic terminals. In general, studies using asymmetrical specializations as a marker for putative glutamatergic terminals provide only weak support for co-release. Ikemoto et al. (1996) showed that some terminals immunopositive for DA, possessed asymmetric synapses. However, the numbers were quite low, tyrosine-hydroxylase immunoreactive (TH+) terminals formed asymmetric synapses in 1/252 cases in dorsolateral striatum. This suggests that a reasonable estimate is <1% of nigrostriatal DA terminals are asymmetric, and presumably glutamatergic, although this may be higher in the mesolimbic pathway. In PFC, Descarries et al. (1987) estimated around 11% of terminals immunoreactive for DA formed asymmetric synapses. It is not known whether eleven percent is sufficient to produce a reasonable EPSP in the PFC, yet the diffuse nature of VTA axon branching make it a possibility.

Until recently, there was also no known way to package glutamate in DA neurons because of the relative absence of VTA neuron cell bodies immunopositive for the vesicular glutamate transporters vGluT1 and 2 (Fujiyama et al., 2001; Bellocchio et al., 1998). However, within the last year there have been several groups which have provided evidence for a third glutamate transporter vGluT3 (Fremeau Jr. et al., 2002; Gras et al., 2002; Schafer et al., 2002; Takamori et al., 2002). It appears that VgluT3 expression is different than that of Vglut1 and Vglut2 and is more discreet in its expression. VgluT3 is expressed in neurons containing VAChT, VMAT, TrypH, and GAD yet evidence for colocalization of tyrosine hydroxylase with Vglut3 in non-cultured neurons has proven elusive. Vglut3 mRNA is observed in DA-rich regions such as the VTA and SN in some cases but not others (Herzog et al., 2004; Fremeau Jr. et al., 2002; Gras et al., 2002; Schafer et al., 2002; Takamori et al., 2002). Electron microscopy analyses have found evidence of Vglut3 at symmetrical as well as asymmetrical synapses, in contrast to Vglut1 and Vglut2 that are found almost exclusively at asymmetric synapses. Therefore, while possible, it is still unclear whether vGlut3 is a viable candidate mechanism to load glutamate into vesicles in monoamine synapses and possibly DA containing neurons.

### 13.2. Physiological evidence for glutamate co-release in DA neurons

In vivo, PFC neurons respond to both iontophoretic applied DA and glutamate. DA induces a slow depolarization and cessation of spiking, while glutamate produces a faster depolarization and greatly enhances spiking (Bernardi et al., 1982; Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000). Direct stimulation of the VTA evokes a fast EPSP that is not blocked by DA antagonists (Fig. 11; Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000; Lavin et al., 2002). The presence of a fast, glutamate antagonist-sensitive EPSP in the VTA → PFC (or nigrostriatal) pathway would seem to serve as evidence for co-release of glutamate from VTA neurons. However, the classic physiological argument against co-release of glutamate from DA fibers is that DA fibers are not myelinated and therefore, their conduction velocity is too slow to mediate the EPSP (Kitai et al., 1976; Mercuri et al., 1985). Based on antidromic activation, the velocity of conduction reported for VTA-cortical fibers is between 0.55 and 11.5 m/s (Deniau et al., 1980; Thierry et al., 1980). The fast conduction (11.5 m/s) fibers are unaffected by 6OHDA lesions and are likely myelinated non-DA fibers (Thierry et al., 1980). The lower conduction value of 0.55 m/s for unmyelinated mesolimbic DA fibers is similar to the 0.58 m/s reported for nigrostriatal DA fibers (Guyenet and Aghajanian, 1978). The VTA → PFC pathway may be 5–10 mm in length, depending on its exact course. The predicted latency for a VTA–PFC DA fibers will therefore be between 9.5 and 18 ms. We found that in 25 PFC
neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo, VTA stimulation evoked an EPSP with an average onset latency of 7.8 ± 4.4 ms (X ± S.D.) and a range of 2–19 ms (Fig. 11). The recorded values are therefore on the fast end of the range for conduction by DA fibers.

Sulzer et al. (1998) circumvented the limitations of the *in vivo* preparation to address this issue of co-release. They have shown that tyrosine hydroxylase-positive (TH+) neurons are immunoreactive for glutamate in primate and rat slices. Nevertheless, one might argue that the glutamate immunoreactivity does not mean that the glutamate is acting as a neurotransmitter, given the ubiquity of glutamate in neurons. In addition, DA neurons grown in primary cultures make glutamatergic synapses that can produce glutamatergic autaptic EPSPs or EPSPs in neighboring cells (Joyce and Rayport, 2000). However, there is a possibility that neurons grown in primary culture may lose their DA phenotype and become glutamatergic even though they still are TH+.

Recently, the same group has recorded fast EPSPs in nucleus accumbens neurons after stimulation of the VTA in a novel slice preparation that preserves the VTA to nucleus accumbens pathway. This response was glutamate and not DA mediated and remained intact after other afferents to the nucleus accumbens were removed (Chuhma et al., 2004). Moreover, intracellular recordings in PFC neurons in vivo also demonstrated the presence of a glutamatergic synaptic responses upon VTA stimulation (Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000; Lavin et al., 2002). While these data provide stronger support for synaptic release of glutamate from VTA neurons, there is the possibility that the VTA evoked EPSP recorded in PFC is not directly mediated by the VTA → PFC pathway because electrical stimulation of the VTA may: (a) antidromically drive adjacent PFC neurons that have collaterals that project to the recorded neuron; or (b) activate glutamatergic fibers that pass through the VTA (Au-Young et al., 1999). However, when NMDA was applied directly into the VTA to stimulate NMDA receptors in VTA cell bodies in vivo, membrane depolarization was still recorded intracellularly in the PFC in vivo (Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000). Glutamate, and not DA antagonists eliminated the EPSP, suggesting that the VTA-evoked EPSP is glutamate-mediated (Lavin et al., 2002). The synaptic response was also abolished by 6OHDA lesions of the VTA. Since the EPSP was eliminated after selective 6OHDA destruction of DA neurons, this suggests that the glutamate that mediates the evoked fast EPSP was originally derived from VTA DA neurons. Collectively, when viewed in light of the evidence reviewed earlier, the evidence for synaptic co-release of DA and glutamate is growing although important issues remain.

13.3. The functional advantage of co-release

If VTA neurons co-release glutamate (along with DA and GABA), then potential issues regarding the fast inhibition produced by VTA stimulation raised earlier, could be reappraised. It is clear that when the VTA is stimulated electrically, an EPSP recorded in PFC pyramidal neurons is always evoked first, which is then followed by an IPSP (Bernardi et al., 1982; Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000; Lavin et al., 2002). This EPSP–IPSP sequence is possibly initiated by glutamate release onto GABAergic interneurons in PFC, and/or GABA released from the VTA → PFC neurons (Carr and Sesack, 2000; Krimer and Goldman-Rakic, 2001). Hence, much of the putative VTA-mediated fast inhibition of PFC neurons may not be DA mediated as noted earlier. This would reconcile the fact that so much extracellular *in vivo* recording data points to a fast inhibitory action of DA (Pirot et al., 1992; Mantz et al., 1992; Ferron et al., 1984; Godbout et al., 1991; Bunney and Aghajanian, 1976; Mora et al., 1976) that is simply not observed *in vitro* where the VTA input is absent and therefore incapable of evoking an EPSP–IPSP. Thus, the fast EPSP–IPSP sequence evokes the fast inhibition, while DA produces a tonic modulation in excitability produced by a sustained DA tone on D2 receptors, as described earlier.

Glutamate co-release from VTA–PFC neurons may also offer some resolution to issues surrounding the application of the ‘prediction error’ theory to the VTA → PFC pathway. As noted earlier, within the PFC DA is released as effectively by events of positive and negative valence and the release and postsynaptic effects far outlasts the initiating event. The notion of a co-release of glutamate, if and when it occurs in the PFC, provides a palatable alternative. Specifically, VTA neuron firing could signal errors in reward predictions via glutamate release and EPSP generation in PFC. For instance if a reward is encountered that is better than predicted, VTA neurons burst and cause summating EPSPs in PFC neurons. These EPSPs produce robust ‘up’ states in the PFC (Lewis and O’Donnell, 2000; Seamans et al., 2003), yet their effects would terminate within a few hundred milliseconds. In this way glutamate would have correctly and precisely transferred the presence of an event that was better than expected to PFC networks that represent information about such events in memory.

On the other hand, if we assume that tonic VTA firing is evoking tonic glutamate release, then PFC neurons would be receiving constant barrages of EPSPs. These EPSPs will help to maintain PFC neurons in ‘up-states’ (Seamans et al., 2003), while a lack of such input would tend to terminate ‘up-states’ for some brief period. Therefore, if an event is worse than predicted and VTA neurons cease to fire for a brief interval (Schultz, 1997), and the lack of excitatory drive would be encoded as a lack of ‘up’ state activity within the PFC. Again, this effect would also be transient in nature. This view of the mesocortical system is consistent with the finding that handling stress can increase DA levels in PFC byupwards of 200% without affecting glutamate release ([Del Arco et al., 2001; Del Arco and Mora, 2001]), showing that unlike DA, glutamate can be uncoupled from the encoding of negative stimuli. Although PFC DA and glutamate release can be uncoupled, there is ample evidence that glutamate is often released in significant amounts in PFC during restraint stress, but the glutamate is likely released from glutamatergic projections to PFC from other brain regions, than VTA ([Moghaddam, 2002; Moghaddam et al., 1994]). If glutamate is co-released from DA neurons, both the single-unit recording data and the data on DA release during behavior become compatible and the basic physiological properties of each system are optimized with glutamate mediating fast signaling while DA, which has no ionotropic receptors in PFC, provides the overall processing ‘tone’ on PFC networks. The extension of this theory to working memory processes mediated by the PFC is discussed further.

### 14. A theory of DA function in PFC

Before one can understand the functions of DA in PFC, general operating principles of PFC networks should be outlined. As discussed earlier, perhaps the most established theory about the function of PFC networks is that they hold and manipulate information for future use, via persistent activity states ([Goldman-Rakic, 1995, 1996; Fuster, 1990, 2000a, 2000b]). This persistent activity is the result of a complex interplay of a variety of ionic and synaptic currents, but at least in reduced systems, depend strongly on NMDA and GABA currents ([Seamans et al., 2003; Durstewitz et al., 2000b; Wang, 1999]).

DA exerts effects on a number of ionic currents in PFC pyramidal and interneurons including NMDA and GABA currents. The known effects of DA on PFC neurons are shown in Fig. 9. From this figure it is difficult to ascertain a function for PFC DA since it is capable of regulating activity in opposite directions, enhancing and depressing both excitatory and inhibitory currents. Furthermore, when one considers that these neurons are embedded in an active network and that each intrinsic current is highly non-linear, it becomes impossible to predict the outcome of DA modulation. One way to deal with this complexity is to employ computational modeling techniques that accurately simulate complex non-linear interactions.

The strategy employed by our collaborator Dr. Daniel Durstewitz has been to produce models that captured as many of the key features of the PFC in a simplified tractable way. Our network models were built from single neurons whose properties were derived from in vitro patch-clamp recordings. These neurons were then connected into cell assemblies. Cell assemblies were embedded in a network of reciprocally interconnected pyramidal cells with varying synaptic weights. Connection weights between neurons within an assembly were high relative to the connections to pyramidal neurons outside the assembly but assemblies were allowed to partially overlap. Excitatory synapses made between pyramidal cells and from pyramidal cells to interneurons possessed both AMPA- and NMDA-like conductances. In the baseline condition the model network exhibited two basic activity modes corresponding to the in vivo situation: uniform low spontaneous and stimulus-dependent high persistent activity. This high persistent activity state was proposed to model the active maintenance of a stimulus in working memory. Switching from the low stable state to the stable persistent high states could be induced by brief stimulation of excitatory input to one assembly ([Durstewitz et al., 2000a, 2000b; Durstewitz and Seamans, 2002]).

In the models DA was simulated by changing the equations for ionic currents according to our in vitro patch-clamp data. Specifically, NMDA and $GABA_{A}$ conductances were increased by about 40% while AMPA conductances were reduced by 15%. However, the same model outcomes could be obtained when dopaminergic modulation of other intrinsic voltage-gated currents were implemented in the simulations and in fact, D1-induced changes in voltage-gated currents like $I_{\text{NaP}}$ and $I_{\text{Ca}^{2+}}$ only served to augment the effects produced by D1-mediated changes in synaptic currents ([Durstewitz et al., 1999, 2000a]). In this way, there was a functional convergence of the seemingly diverse DA effects.

We observed that the simulated D1 receptor activation caused persistent high activity states to be enhanced, relative to changes in spontaneous activity, as was the case in vivo (see Table 1). Moreover, D1 receptor simulation widened and deepened the basins of attraction of low (spontaneous) and high (working memory) activity states of the network, making it more difficult to switch from one state to the other. This occurred even if there were *no* changes in average firing rate associated with DA ([Durstewitz and Seamans, 2002]). This effect at different activity levels is a consequence of the contributions of different currents to each state. Whereas $GABA_{A}$ currents contribute more charge than NMDA currents in the low state, this relationship reversed in the high state. Hence, because D1 receptor activation enhances both these currents there were differential effects on low and high states. During persistent high activity states recurrent activity increased relative to background activity and this in turn increased NMDA activation more. At a higher average membrane voltage in the high state NMDA conductances due to their voltage-dependence experienced a non-linear boost, unlike AMPA and $GABA_{A}$ conductances. Moreover, long-lasting NMDA currents flux much more charge when activated relative to the faster $GABA_{A}$ and AMPA currents. These simulations therefore highlight the frequency-dependent effects of DA states in FEATURE #8.

With D1-mediated alterations in NMDA and $GABA_{A}$ currents it becomes much harder to interrupt persistent activity by interfering stimuli or noise. In this way D1 receptor stimulation enhances the robustness of working

Fig. 13. A two-state model of DA’s action in PFC. A slab of PFC is represented and peaks denote ‘up’ states, corresponding to sustained recurrent activity required to hold items in working memory. (Left) In state 1, the D2 modulation predominates, and there is a net reduction in inhibition. As a result, multiple inputs impinging on the PFC have access to the working memory buffers, allowing multiple representations (i.e. sustained activity driven by recurrent excitation that encodes working memory information) to be held in PFC networks nearly simultaneously. (Right) In state 2, the D1 modulation predominates, and there is a net increase in inhibition. As a result, inputs have difficulty accessing PFC networks. However, particularly strong inputs, which can overcome the effects of heightened inhibition, benefit from the simultaneous D1-mediated increases in long-lasting inward currents (i.e. persistent Na⁺ and NMDA currents), which produce very active and stable network representations, even after the offset of the initiating stimulus (Yang and Seamans, 1996; Durstewitz et al., 2000a, 2000b; Seamans et al., 2001a). In this way, DA may first allow an exploration of the input space (state 1), entertaining multiple network representations nearly simultaneously. Subsequent transition into state 2 shuts off the influence of weak inputs on PFC networks and strongly stabilizes one or a limited set of representations, which would then have complete control of PFC output.

memory representations (Durstewitz et al., 2000a). Robust representations are important in the context of working memory that requires an organism to pursue goals over time. Thus, although D1 receptors appear to regulate a number of diverse and unrelated currents, all these actions converge on a common function; namely augmenting robustness of working memory representations. These properties are represented as state 2 in Fig. 13.

The bidirectional (FEATURES #2, 6, 12) actions of DA could in theory switch the system away from robustness. This could happen with very strong D1 receptor activation that reduces NMDA currents (Fig. 5) or strong D2 receptor activation that reduces NMDA currents (Zheng et al., 1999) and GABA<sub>A</sub> currents (Seamans et al., 2001b). In the situation of reduced GABA tone, our models show that high persistent activity states tend to “pop out” spontaneously (Durstewitz et al., 2000a) and are easy to disrupt. So it would appear that very strong D2 receptor activation should actually disrupt working memory performance in the presence of distractors as PFC networks would switch back to state 1 in Fig. 13. Specifically, networks would exhibit less stimulus dependent tuning as many items would be represented nearly simultaneously, but none would be represented particularly strongly. The prediction that high D1 stimulation should disrupt tuning of working memory representations is in agreement with the inverted-‘U’ function for D1 receptors proposed by Williams and Goldman-Rakic (1995) and supported by behavioral data (Zahrt et al., 1997; Floresco and Phillips, 2001; Granon et al., 2000).

It is assumed that there is a balance between D1 and D2 receptor activation. As such PFC networks would function in between states 1 and 2. As a concrete example consider a working memory task on a radial arm maze where DA levels are correlated with task performance and blockade of DA receptors impact negatively task performance (Fig. 2). On such tasks state 1 may be necessary for the animal to consider potential options for action, perhaps sampling arms and deciding on a foraging strategy. A bias towards state 1 may therefore be important in situations requiring response flexibility and open-ended problem solving, where many options for action must be held in memory and compared. The downside of a strong state 1 bias would be that all options are considered but none is particularly dominant in guiding behavior. Accordingly, delivery of a D1 antagonist, which would bias the system towards state 1, results in random responding on this task (Seamans et al., 1998). In contrast, application of a D1 agonist also impairs performance of working memory tasks, but was more the result of perseverative response errors (Zahrt et al., 1997; Floresco and Phillips, 2001; Krunzler, personal communication). Furthermore, D1 antagonists or DA depletion in the PFC reverse amphetamine-induced stereotypy and promote attentional set shifting on a modified version of the Wisconsin card sorting task (Ellenbroek et al., 1989; Roberts et al., 1994). Strong state 2 would be predicted to lock working memory buffers in PFC into a single mode of action, such that one or a few representations completely guide action at the expense of response flexibility.

advantage of state 2 processing however, is that a goal for action can be pursued in the face of distractors.

As reviewed earlier, there are concentration and receptor subtype dependent actions of DA in the PFC. DA at low concentrations appears to act via D1 receptors to enhance NMDA EPSCs and GABA IPSCs, yet at higher concentrations acts via D2 receptors to reduce these currents (Zheng et al., 1999; Seamans et al., 2001b; Trantham et al., 2003). These are two of the key currents that dictate the dynamics of the proposed PFC states shown in Fig. 13. This implies that moderate activation of the mesocortical system that elevates PFC DA levels to tens to hundreds of nM should preferentially activate D1 receptors and establish a state 2 dynamic for a prolonged period. Accordingly, DA levels are elevated into the nM range on a working memory task (Phillips et al., 2004) and D1, but not D2, receptor blockade disrupts working performance on such tasks (Seamans et al., 1998). Thus, moderate activation of the mesocortical DA system may establish a state 2 dynamic in PFC and allow information to be held robustly by working memory buffers.

The in vitro data also suggest that high micromolar DA levels are required to activate D2 receptors in PFC that subsequently decrease NMDA and GABA currents (Zheng et al., 1999; Seamans et al., 2001b; Trantham et al., 2003). Such a decrease establishes a state 1 dynamic in our models. It is rare to achieve such μM extrasynaptic DA levels in PFC, even with strong burst stimulation (Garris et al., 1993). However, the concentration of DA in the synaptic cleft is expected to be much higher than the DA concentrations measured extrasynaptically by a carbon fiber or microdialysis probe in PFC. These high intrasynaptic DA would not initially activate D1 receptors because, as reviewed earlier, D1 receptors are mainly, if not exclusively, extrasynaptic. Thus, synaptically located D2 receptors may respond first to these high phasic DA levels. The elevated phasic DA release may activate D2 receptors and set up a transient state 1 dynamic prior to diffusing into the extrasynaptic space, activating D1 receptors and re-establishing a state 2 dynamic. In effect, a high phasic intrasynaptic DA bolus would briefly reverse the state 2 dynamic established by lower levels of DA acting on extrasynaptic D1 receptors. In this way, state 1 may actually only be established in PFC networks transiently. However, its function would be to reset cortical networks, so that the robustness enhancing effects of D1 receptor activation are reversed momentarily so that new information is allowed easy access to working memory buffers. This may be perhaps how new goal state representations are established. Once established, they would be maintained by the subsequent D1-mediated mechanisms responsible for establishing a state 2 dynamic.

sets the gain for PFC networks (see also Servan-Schreiber et al., 1990). It is glutamate that transmits actual information, and we suggested specifically that glutamate might transfer the fast ‘prediction error’ signal encoded by VTA neurons. The glutamate released by VTA neurons as they fire in response to reward related information might set PFC networks into persistent activity states as shown in Fig. 14 (Seamans et al., 2003). VTA induction of PFC ‘up’ states would allow for control of working memory buffers by prediction error signals. A glutamate signal transferred from VTA neurons would inform the PFC that a stimulus is better than predicted and to hold this information in a working memory buffer. However, the VTA neuron firing need not correlate with this momentary holding of working memory (Ljungberg et al., 1991), but the signal from the VTA is needed to initiate a persistent activity state. The actual persistent activity evoked by the glutamate input informs the PFC about *when* to enter a persistent activity state (Fig. 14). Other inputs may play a similar role but for different types of information. For instance, the hippocampus which transfers information to the PFC about spatially-based prospective responding (Floresco et al., 1997; Seamans et al., 1998) also has been shown to effectively put PFC networks in a high activity state (Seamans et al., 2003). In this case, the hippocampus may inform the PFC about contextual or spatial information and to hold and process information for future use.

The difference between limbic or other cortical inputs and the VTA is that the VTA also provides a DA ‘tone’. This ‘tone’ influences persistent activity states evoked by any input. According to our models, these ‘up’ states, initiated by glutamatergic afferents, become much more robust in the presence of moderate DA tone and D1 receptor activation. To simplify these ideas even further, we suggest that limbic glutamatergic inputs ‘inform’ PFC networks about *when* to initiate persistent activity and *what* type of information is to be held by such activity, while the DA system influences gain of the glutamate-encoded information (Fig. 14). By gain, we mean how strongly a certain representation is maintained as a persistent activity state. A low gain situation is represented as state 1 (in Fig. 13) in that no particular representation dominates the network. A high gain situation is specified by state 2 (in Fig. 13) whereby a single representation dominates the PFC landscape and presumably PFC output. In this way, DA could be said to control attention within working memory, but specifies nothing about its contents. Because we hypothesize that the DA signal provides no specific information, DA signals can fluctuate over many minutes without conforming to the requirements required to faithfully transfer a prediction error signal or any information-rich signal. As a result the burden of DA transferring both fast and slow signals to the PFC is eliminated. On the other hand, glutamate is well suited for this task as its main synaptic function is to produce transient postsynaptic signals. Thus DA is a true neuromodulator that only regulates how information is processed. This allows the

### 14.1. The role of the ascending VTA–PFC pathway in working memory

In this formalization, DA provides only a processing tone in PFC. The DA signal contains no information, but rather

ing memory prior to the completion of a thought or action. As a result, networks encoding information as persistent activity states would be ‘contaminated’ by ‘weak’ stimuli that are normally ignored. The inability to restrict access of such stimuli to PFC networks would result in distractibility, tangential or intrusive thought patterns characteristic of the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. This situation is best represented by extreme state 1 behavior in Fig. 13. The prediction is that a strong state 1 situation should be brought under control by blocking D2 receptors, thereby forcing the system into state 2. Accordingly, all effective anti-psychotic medications used to treat the positive symptoms of schizophrenia block D2 receptors (Fig. 15).

If both DA and glutamate systems are dysfunctional, persistent activity states are unstable (due to reduced DA function) and initiated at improper times relative to firing in limbic regions (due to reduced glutamatergic function). If limbic regions provide the PFC with contextual (i.e., from the hippocampus) or emotional (i.e., from the amygdala) information, this would mean that contextually or emotionally inappropriate stimuli would be encoded by network as persistent activity, progressively uncoupling the patient’s thoughts and actions from reality. Another situation where the PFC becomes uncoupled from inputs encoding information about the external world is with supraoptimal D1 receptor stimulation. Supraoptimal D1 receptor stimulation would push the PFC strongly into state 2. In this situation, persistent activity becomes extremely robust, and virtually impossible to disrupt (Durstewitz and Seamans, 2002). As a result, PFC networks become locked into the encoding of a single item in working memory, leading to stereotyped thoughts or actions. Moreover, since the PFC is essentially cut off from the external world, the patient would progressively focus on internal representations that continue to repeatedly and strongly control working memory buffers in PFC. This would possibly initiate the process of social isolation and other aspects of the negative symptomatology of schizophrenia. Accordingly, recent data shows that D1 receptor density in PFC is directly correlated to the severity of negative symptoms in schizophrenia (Abi-Dargham et al., 2002; Abi-Dargham and Moore, 2003; Guo et al., 2003).

A relevant question is what would happen with naturally occurring variations in DA signaling in the PFC in normal and schizophrenic individuals. Such a situation exists with natural variations in the gene that encodes COMT, an enzyme that degrades DA. As noted above, COMT has a predominate role in terminating DA’s action in PFC where there are few DA transporters. Normal individuals with a form of the Val/Val COMT polymorphism that results in relatively higher COMT activity (and lower basal DA levels) when given amphetamine to artificially increase DA levels showed increased cortical efficiency in the PFC as measured with fMRI. The increased efficiency on working memory tasks, may raise extrasynaptic DA levels into the nM range and establish a state 2 dynamic. The results of these studies show a BOLD response in PFC that is exactly what is

Fig. 14. Effects of VTA activation on PFC neurons and networks. (Top left) A PFC neuron recorded intracellular in vivo enters a persistent activity ‘up’ state following VTA stimulation (figure courtesy A. Lavin). (Top right) A similar effect is observed when the VTA is stimulated in an organotypic co-culture of the VTA and PFC (from Seamans et al., 2003). (Bottom) Schematic representation of proposed interactions between the VTA and PFC. The activity of the PFC neuron is shown on top and the VTA neuron on the bottom. In control conditions where there is little DA tone, VTA neurons fire at a low basal rate until a stimulus of “better than expected” rewarding value is encountered. Under these conditions, VTA neurons burst and this causes release of glutamate in PFC that evokes an ‘up’ state of persistent activity that terminates in a few hundred milliseconds. If the exact same process occurs with larger levels of extrasynaptic DA present, the same ‘up’ state of persistent activity is much more robust and longer lasting.

## 15. Relevance to PFC pathophysiology in schizophrenia

Our proposed model has implications for how DA and glutamate interact to produce stable persistent activity states in neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia (Goldman-Rakic, 1996). Stable persistent activity states are required to maintain information in working memory until an appropriate response is executed. Hypofunction of the DA system in the PFC would cause persistent activity states to be unstable to distracters, as discussed earlier. If persistent activity indeed encodes information in working memory (Goldman-Rakic, 1995), low DA tone on D1 receptors would cause premature termination of information in work-
