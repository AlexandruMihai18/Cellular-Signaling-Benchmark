## Abstract  
Alginate is a linear polysaccharide that can be used for different applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries. These polysaccharides have a chemical structure composed of subunits of (1–4)-β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and its C-5 epimer α-L-guluronic acid (G). The monomer composition and molecular weight of alginates are known to have effects on their properties. Currently, these polysaccharides are commercially extracted from seaweed but can also be produced by *Azotobacter vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp. as an extracellular polymer. One strategy to produce alginates with different molecular weights and with reproducible physicochemical characteristics is through the manipulation of the culture conditions during fermentation. This mini-review provides a comparative analysis of the metabolic pathways and molecular mechanisms involved in alginate polymerization from *A. vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp. Different fermentation strategies used to produce alginates at a bioreactor laboratory scale are described.

## Introduction  
Alginates are linear polysaccharides composed of (1–4)-β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and its C-5 epimer α-L-guluronic acid (G). These polysaccharides are produced by seaweed and two bacterial genera, *Azotobacter vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp. (Clementi 1997; Rehm 2010). Bacterial alginate production can be easily tailored to obtain molecules with different characteristics and compositions, principally in terms of molecular weight and M/G distribution (Rehm and Valla 1997; Ertesvåg et al. 2017). For this reason, bacterial alginates are of potential commercial interest for use in different industrial applications (Rehm 2010). The mechanisms of regulation and biosynthesis of alginate are similar among *A. vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp., although the biological function, physical role, and properties of the alginate differ between the two genera (Remminghorst and Rehm 2006; Hay et al. 2014). To meet the demand for the different applications of alginate in biotechnology and biomedicine, bacterial alginate production has been evaluated under different culture conditions (Flores et al. 2015). In this review, a comparative analysis of the biosynthesis and bacterial alginate production by fermentation using *A. vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp. are described.

## Bacterial production of alginate  
*Azotobacter vinelandii* is a strict aerobe able to fix nitrogen and synthesize two polymers during vegetative growth, alginate and intracellular polyesters (polyhydroxybutyrate) (Galindo et al. 2007; Rehm 2010). In *A. vinelandii*, alginate is produced as part of the encystment process, as a mechanism to promote desiccation-resistance under adverse environmental conditions to maintain hydration of the cell (Gacesa 1998; Hay et al. 2014), being a structural element
in the cell (Remminghorst and Rehm 2006). Moreover, it can act as a protective barrier against heavy metal toxicity, generating an ion-exchange system with selectivity for Ca²⁺ (Sabra et al. 2000; Segura et al. 2003; Flores et al. 2015). In contrast, alginate can also act as a diffusion barrier against oxygen, mainly its content of guluronic acid, limiting its transfer to the nitrogenase enzyme complex (Sabra et al. 2000), which is highly sensitive to oxygen (Oelze 2000). In *P. aeruginosa* (mucoid phenotype), the alginate is the causative agent of cystic fibrosis, and it is associated with pathogenicity (Ramphal and Pier 1985; Franklin et al. 2011; Hay et al. 2014). Alginate biosynthesis in *Pseudomonas* spp. is induced under desiccating conditions and is probably a key component of stable biofilms in a range of environments (Gacesa 1998; Hay et al. 2014).

(FGG=0). Unlike alginates from seaweed (Acetylation=0), bacterial alginates have a high degree of acetylation, while the M/G ratio in bacterial alginate is slightly higher in *A. vinelandii*. Acetyl groups affect the viscosity and flexibility of the alginate (Ertesvåg 2015). The gelling properties of alginate are related to its G subunits interacting with divalent ions, such as calcium (Ca²⁺), the most commonly used, allowing for the formation of matrices for gels, films, microparticles and others. Alginates that contain G-blocks, such as those produced by *A. vinelandii*, produce stronger gels in the presence of Ca²⁺ and have higher viscosity, while those lacking G-Blocks produce flexible gels in the presence of Ca²⁺ and lower viscosity, such as those produced by *Pseudomonas* spp. (Gacesa 1998; Tøndervik et al. 2010). However, the gel strength is not determined only by the M/G ratio, but also by the presence of frequency G subunits (Gaytán et al. 2012).

### Alginate structure and properties

Alginates are composed of subunits of (1–4)-β-D-mannuronic acid (M) and α-L-guluronic acid (G) in various sequences (Fig. 1). The distribution of monomers in alginate polysaccharide chains may consist of consecutive M (M-Blocks), consecutive G (G-Blocks) or alternating subunits (MG-Blocks). Alginates can be acetylated, the relative amount of M/G ratios and their acetylation varies according to the bacterial species and growth conditions (Clementi 1997; Tøndervik et al. 2010; Maleki et al. 2017). It is well known that the composition of alginate, including the M/G ratio, the degree of acetylation and the molecular weight (MW) determines their rheological properties (Peña et al. 2010). Table 1 shows the chemical composition of various alginates. Comparing alginate-producing bacterial strains, *Pseudomonas* spp. alginate does not contain G-Blocks

into fibers with enhanced gel forming capacity compared to  
fibers made of alginate obtained from algae. In this sense,  
the degree of acetylation of alginate and the increasing gel  
formation of alginate obtained from A. vinelandii may be  
appropriate for the preparation of wound dressings (Fischer  
et al. 2017).

### Bacterial alginate synthesis

Alginate biosynthesis is similar in both *Pseudomonas* spp.  
and *A. vinelandii* (Hay et al. 2013), although some differ-  
ences have been observed. Figure 2 shows a schematic of  
alginate biosynthesis that is detailed below in the form of  
how the alginate chain is produced.

#### Synthesis of precursor

The alginate is synthesized from fructose-6-phosphate  
(F6P), which is converted to GDP-mannuronic acid (an  
alginate precursor) by means of four enzymatic steps in  
the cell cytosol. The alginate synthesis within the cytosol  
begins with the conversion of F6P to mannose-6-phosphate  
(M6P), which is catalyzed by AlgA. AlgC converts M6P to  
mannose-1-phosphate (M1P), followed by the conversion to  
GDP-mannose, which is catalyzed by AlgA. GDP-mannose  
is oxidized by AlgD to GDP-mannuronic acid, which is the  
irreversible step in alginate precursor formation (Galindo  
et al. 2007). Notably, AlgA is a bifunctional monomeric  
enzyme that has both phosphomannose isomerase and GDP-  
mannose pyrophosphorylase activities, both of which are

important in the biosynthesis of alginate (Shinabarger et al. 1991).

# Polymerization

Polymerization of GDP-mannuronic acid is carried out by two enzymes located on the inner membrane (IM): glycosyltransferase/polymerase (Alg8) and copolymerase (Alg44). Both enzymes are part of the polymerase complex and are indispensable for alginate production (Galindo et al. 2007; Hay et al. 2013). The polymerase complex is activated by a secondary messenger bis-(3′-5′)-cyclic dimeric GMP (c-di-GMP) (Ahumada-Manuel et al. 2017). Alg44 has a cytoplasmic PilZ domain that binds to the cofactor c-di-GMP and is required to activate the Alg44 function and alginate production (Fata Moradali et al. 2015). Point mutations in the PilZ domain results in loss of c-di-GMP binding, leading to a loss of alginate production (Franklin et al. 2011). Alg44 is additionally thought to interact with the lipoprotein AlgK, located on the periplasmic side of the outer membrane (OM), stabilizing the polymerase complex and playing a role in the localization of the OM porin protein AlgJ (named AlgE in *P. aeruginosa*) (Keiski et al. 2007; Franklin et al. 2011). Alg8 plays a key role in alginate production in *P. aeruginosa*; it has been reported that in *A. vinelandii* and *P. aeruginosa* PAO1, *alg8* overexpression increases alginate production 20-fold compared to the wild-type strain (Remminghorst and Rehm 2006). In *A. vinelandii* it has been reported that a higher relative expression of *alg8* increases the MW of alginate (Díaz-Barrera et al. 2012), suggesting that Alg8 might be involved in key step in alginate production.

# Modification and secretion

In the periplasm, polymannuronic acid undergoes an *O*-acetylase modification by the addition of acetyl groups O-2 and/or O-3 hydroxyls by an enzymatic complex consisting of four essential enzymes, AlgI, AlgV (named AlgJ in *P. aeruginosa*), AlgF and AlgX. AlgI and AlgV are located on the IM, whereas AlgF and AlgX are located in the periplasm (Franklin and Ohman 1996; Ertesvåg et al. 2017). AlgI transports acetyl-CoA groups (donor molecule of the acetyl group) from the cytoplasm to the periplasmic space where acetylation is carried out. The acetyl groups are transferred by the actions of AlgF, AlgX and AlgV to acetylate the M subunits in the alginate chain. AlgX is a protein of unknown function but is essential for alginate biosynthesis and has 69% similarity with AlgV (Franklin and Ohman 1996). The non-acetylated M subunits can be epimerized to guluronate by AlgG, a mannuronan C5-epimerase located in the periplasm that catalyzes the epimerization of the M to G subunits at the polymer level (Maleki et al. 2017). The epimerization process is influenced by the concentration of Ca²⁺ used in the growth medium; whereas the presence of Zn²⁺ causes complete inhibition, altering the structural properties of the alginate (Gacesa 1998). In *Pseudomonas* spp. and in *A. vinelandii*, two types of epimerases have been described in relation to binding of Ca²⁺, including the AlgG-type (Ca²⁺-independent) and the AlgE-type (Ca²⁺-dependent) (Ertesvåg 2015). AlgK and AlgX have been suggested to help protect the nascent polymer from the action of AlgL (Keiski et al. 2007), an alginate lyase located in the periplasm that controls the MW of the alginate chain (Trujillo-Roldán et al. 2004). AlgL can degrade alginate through β-elimination of the glycosidic bond (cleaves M-M and M-G subunits) (Xiao et al. 2006; Ma et al. 2008; Gimmetstad et al. 2009). Six enzymes are encoded in the *A. vinelandii* genome with alginate lyase activity: alginate lyase (AlgL); the extracellular bifunctional mannuronan C-5 epimerase and alginate lyase AlgE7 (degrades G-MM and G-GM bonds); three AlyA lyases: AlyA1, AlyA2 and AlyA3 (cleaves G-M and M-G bonds), although at different rates; and an exolysase, AlyB (uncharacterized), whereas *P. aeruginosa* possesses two enzymes with alginate lyase activity: AlgL and Pal167 (with biological function unknown) (Gimmetstad et al. 2009; Ertesvåg 2015). Finally, the alginate chain is secreted through the OM by the porin protein AlgJ (named AlgE in *P. aeruginosa*) into the extracellular environment. In the case of *A. vinelandii*, but not in *Pseudomonas* spp., seven mannuronan C-5 extracellular epimerases (named AlgE1-7) can modify the non-acetylated M subunits of the chain to generate the final alginate product (Remminghorst and Rehm 2006; Hay et al. 2013; Ahumada-Manuel et al. 2017). AlgE1-7 can be grouped according to the type of subunits they introduce in the alginate polymeric chain. AlgE1, AlgE3 and AlgE7 introduce MG-Blocks; AlgE2 and AlgE5 introduce GG-Blocks; AlgE4 introduces a high proportion of G subunits, but no consecutive G-Blocks; and AlgE6 introduces equal amounts of M-Blocks and G-Blocks (Høidal et al. 2000). The differences in the alginate biosynthetic enzymes are summarized in Table 2 comparing both bacterial genera.

# Regulation of bacterial alginate biosynthesis

In Fig. 3a schematic representation of the regulation of alginate biosynthesis is shown. The genes involved in regulation of alginate biosynthesis are transcribed by the RNA polymerase associated with the sigma (σ) factor AlgU, located upstream of *algD* promoter (Mejía-Ruiz et al. 1997; Hay et al. 2014). AlgU is a positive regulator located in the cytosol that is homologous to the alternative σ⁸ factor and this is essential for alginate production (Franklin et al. 2011; Hay et al. 2013; Pacheco-Leyva et al. 2016). AlgU is encoded in an operon containing four genes (*mucA*, *mucB*, *mucC* and *mucD*), which are part of the same transcriptional

unit. MucA is a negative regulator located in the IM that has anti-σ^E^ factor activity. MucB is a negative regulator located in the periplasm that stabilizes MucA. MucC does not have a clear regulatory role and is localized in the IM or periplasm. MucD is a negative regulator localized in the periplasm and is a serine protease and chaperone-like protein that plays a central role in AlgU activation (Núñez et al. 2000). MucD is a key regulatory protein that interacts with the complex through AlgX (Hay et al. 2013). In A. vinelandii and Pseudomonas spp., the mucABCD genes are located downstream of the algU gene, forming the algUmucABCD gene cluster, with similar regulatory role in alginate biosynthesis in both strains (Núñez et al. 2000). In A. vinelandii, the regulation of alginate production is under the

control of the algUmucABCD gene cluster, with the transcription of AlgU requiring at least two promoters, *algCp1* (a putative promoter located upstream of *algC*) and *algDp2* (*AlgU σE*-dependent promoter) (Mejía-Ruiz et al. 1997). In *P. aeruginosa*, AlgU is responsible for the transcription of the *algD* gene (Núñez et al. 2000), and the *algUmucABCD* genes comprise the primary switch controlling the conversion between non-mucoid and mucoid phenotype (Hay et al. 2014). In *Pseudomonas* spp., AlgU is typically turned off in the non-mucoid phenotype state and is turned on in the mucoid phenotype state, promoting a high transcription of biosynthetic genes for alginate (Ertesvåg et al. 2017). *P. fluorescens* and *P. syringae* lack the *mucC* gene, and in these species *mucD* transcription is not dependent on AlgU (Maleki et al. 2017). Other regulators of alginate biosynthesis include the proteins that form the two-component system GacS/GacA that act as global regulators. In *A. vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp., the disruption of the GacS/GacA reduces the transcription of *algD* and controls alginate biosynthesis indirectly, through a signaling cascade involving the post-translational system RsmA/RsmB. Moreover, three positive auxiliary regulators of the two-component family have been described that are located in the cytoplasm, AlgR, AlgB and AlgZ. AlgR is transcribed in response to AlgU and binds to three regions in the *algD* promoter, while AlgB and AlgZ bind to one site on the *algD* promoter (Hay et al. 2013). Thus, the current evidence suggests that the regulation of alginate synthesis may be similar in *Pseudomonas* spp. and *A. vinelandii*.

### Comparison of bacterial alginate production

The alginate from *P. aeruginosa* and *A. vinelandii* can be modified by different fermentation conditions. Bacterial alginate production is mostly studied in *A. vinelandii* because of the pathogenic nature of *P. aeruginosa* and because of its similar composition to alginate produced by seaweed (Hay et al. 2013). In this section, we summarize a comparison of the different operating variables used for the production of bacterial alginate.

#### Alginate produced by *Pseudomonas* spp.

Studies in *Pseudomonas* spp. have reported the production of alginate in shake flasks, batch and continuous cultures (Sengha et al. 1989; Guo et al. 2011; Raza et al. 2012), although most studies have focused on clinical assays. To compare the alginate production in different strains of *Pseudomonas* spp., some investigations are shown in Table 3. The data collected highlights that by using *P. mendocina* spp. in continuous culture it is possible to obtain a high alginate production. However, these studies have not been reproduced. It has been reported that *P. mendocina* NK-01 can produce alginate (0.57 g L⁻¹) with an MW of 1.03 kDa using in batch fermenter (Guo et al. 2011). Additional studies performed in shake flasks reported that *P. fluorescens* WR-1 is able to produce alginate, although its MW has not been reported (Raza et al. 2012). Other studies using modified *P. aeruginosa* strains have reported on the production of alginate with elevated MWs (from 1811 to 4653 kDa) (Fata Moradali et al. 2015). Recently, alginate production has been reported in *P. mandalli* at a low temperature, with alginate yields of 26 μg mL⁻¹ of uronic acid per gram of dry weight cell, which was higher compared with that produced by *P. fluorescens* at similar temperature (1.94 μg mL⁻¹ of uronic acid per gram of dry weight cell) (Vázquez-Ponce et al. 2017).

#### Alginate produced by *A. vinelandii*

To compare the alginate production in *A. vinelandii* we present a summary of different modes of cultivation (Table 4). Different previous works has attempted to establish the culture conditions in a laboratory fermenter in order to produce alginate with similar MW in different production scales (Reyes et al. 2003; Díaz-Barrera et al. 2014a). The collected data (Table 4) highlights that in shake flasks it is possible to obtain alginate with a higher MW (between 1750 and 1980 kDa) and a higher concentration (from 4.3 to 5.5 g L⁻¹) as compared to batch fermenter. It is well established that in the case of the alginate produced by *A. vinelandii*, the

alginate MW is a function of the culture age, observing a drop in polymer size towards the end of the fermentation during batch mode (Peña et al. 2000; Trujillo-Roldán et al. 2004). Table 4 shows values of MW (minimum and maximum) obtained in batch cultures conducted in fermenter. Trujillo-Roldán et al. (2004) noted that alginate MWs of 900 and 1250 kDa can be produced. This variation in the MW is explained because A. vinelandii genome encodes six enzymes with alginate lyase activity (Gimmestad et al. 2009), evidencing that degrades the polymer in the post-polymerization step (Trujillo-Roldán et al. 2004). In this way, a key problem in bacterial alginate production on an industrial level consists of the ability to maintain the MW during the time of cultivation. In order to solve this problem, the production of bacterial alginate through continuous process can be an alternative. The continuous culturing operating in steady-state offers the best way to select and control the growth rate, allowing achieve a physiological state that is kept constant as long as the culture time (Hoskisson and Hobbs 2005). Moreover, a continuous culture will render a product of constant composition and characteristics, while in batch and fed-batch modes, each batch may differ with respect to product quality. Table 4 shows different values of MW obtained under steady-state conditions, in which the MW not changes during the time of operation. Sabra et al. (2000) reported that it is possible to increase the MW (under steady-state conditions) from 400 to 800 kDa by manipulating the dissolved oxygen tension (from 1 to 10%). Díaz-Barrera et al. (2010) managed to increase the MW of alginate from 800 to 2500 kDa by increasing the sucrose concentration in the feed flow from 5 to 20 g L⁻¹. In all these cases, the MW not changed under steady-state condition. Lastly, although a higher specific alginate production rate can be obtained using continuous-mode (until 0.223 g g⁻¹ h⁻¹), as compared to batch-mode (0.070 g g⁻¹ h⁻¹), a lower alginate concentration (less than 2.2 g L⁻¹) is reached under continuous operation.

### Concluding remarks

In this review, the bacterial alginate production has been detailed and compared in *Azotobacter vinelandii* and *Pseudomonas* spp. In both genera, the proteins involved in polymerization, modification and secretion are similar, although in *A. vinelandii* it is possible found more types of proteins with activity lyase and epimerase. A higher frequency of guluronic acid subunits and degree of acetylation can be obtained in the alginate synthesized by *A. vinelandii*. Fermentation strategies in *A. vinelandii* allow to obtaining products with different molecular weight (from 21 to 2500 kDa), which could be used for specific biotechnological and pharmaceutical applications. Using continuous-mode it is possible to

Suc sucrose, Glu glucose, Min minimum value, Max maximum value, nr not reported, nd not determined

produce alginates with similar molecular weight between runs of fermentation, and hence, could be a modality of cultivation for potential industrial production. The current evidences indicates that *A. vinelandii* is an ideal candidate to produce alginate, although it is necessary the development of novel strategies to permit increase its concentration under continuous mode of cultivation.
