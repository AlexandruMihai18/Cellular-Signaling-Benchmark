Caffeine: a well known but little mentioned compound in plant science

Hiroshi Ashihara and Alan Crozier

Caffeine, a purine alkaloid, is a key component of many popular drinks, most notably tea and coffee, yet most plant scientists know little about its biochemistry and molecular biology. A gene from tea leaves encoding caffeine synthase, an N-methyltransferase that catalyses the last two steps of caffeine biosynthesis, has been cloned and the recombinant enzyme produced in E. coli. Similar genes have been isolated from coffee leaves but the recombinant protein has a different substrate specificity to the tea enzyme. The cloning of caffeine biosynthesis genes opens up the possibility of using genetic engineering to produce naturally decaffeinated tea and coffee.

Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine) is one of the few plant products with which the general public is readily familiar, because of its occurrence in beverages such as coffee and tea, as well as various soft drinks. A growing belief that the ingestion of caffeine can have adverse effects on health has resulted in an increased demand for decaffeinated beverages¹. Unpleasant short-term side effects from caffeine include palpitations, gastrointestinal disturbances, anxiety, tremor, increased blood pressure and insomnia²,³. In spite of numerous publications on the long-term consequences of caffeine consumption on human health, no clear picture has emerged, with reports of both protective and deleterious effects⁴.

Caffeine was discovered in tea (Camellia sinensis) and coffee (Coffea arabica) in the 1820s (Ref. 5). Along with other methylxanthines, including theobromine (3,7-dimethylxanthine), paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine) and methyluric acids (Fig. 1), caffeine is a member of a group of compounds known collectively as purine alkaloids. There are two hypotheses about the role of the high concentrations of caffeine that accumulate in tea, coffee and a few other plant species. The ‘chemical defence theory’ proposes that caffeine in young leaves, fruits and flower buds acts to protect soft tissues from predators such as insect larvae⁶ and beetles⁷. The ‘allelopathic theory’ proposes that caffeine in seed coats is released into the soil and inhibits the germination of other seeds⁸. The potential ecological role of caffeine is described in Ref. 6.

It is only within the past five years that the biosynthetic and catabolic pathways that regulate the build-up of caffeine in the vacuoles of cells of tea and coffee plants have been elucidated fully. In contrast with the widespread medical interest in caffeine as a dietary component, these developments have received little attention in the plant literature, with the topic being all but neglected in recent biochemistry textbooks⁹⁻¹².

Caffeine is synthesized from xanthosine via a xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine pathway; the first, third and fourth steps are catalysed by N-methyltransferases that use S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) as the methyl donor¹³. A recent important development has been the cloning and expression in E. coli of a gene from tea leaves that encodes caffeine synthase, an extremely labile N-methyltransferase that catalyses the last two steps in this pathway¹⁴. In addition, coffee leaf cDNAs of theobromine synthase, which catalyses the penultimate methylation step, have been similarly cloned and expressed in E. coli¹⁵,¹⁶. There are also preliminary reports on the cloning of an N-methyltransferase from coffee that catalyses the initial methylation step in the pathway¹⁷,¹⁸. These advances in our knowledge of the metabolism of caffeine and related compounds in plants and the potential biotechnological applications of purine alkaloid research are highlighted in this article.

Distribution of purine alkaloids

Purine alkaloids have a limited distribution within the plant kingdom. In some species, the main purine alkaloid is theobromine or methyluric acids rather than caffeine¹³. Among the purine-alkaloid-containing plants, most studies have been carried out with species belonging to the genera Camellia and Coffea. In C. sinensis (Fig. 2), caffeine is found in the highest concentrations in young leaves of first-flush shoots of var. sinensis (2.8% of the dry weight). Theobromine is the predominant purine alkaloid in young leaves of cocoa tea (Camellia ptilophylla) (5.0–6.8%) and Camellia irrawadiensis (<0.8%).

The beans of most cultivars of Arabica coffee (C. arabica) (Fig. 3) contain ~1.0% caffeine, whereas Coffea canephora cv. Robusta (1.7%) and cv. Guarini (2.4%), Coffea dewevrei (1.2%) and Coffea liberica (1.4%) contain higher concentrations. By contrast, the caffeine contents of the seeds of other species, such as Coffea eugenioides (0.4%), Coffea salvatrix (0.7%) and Coffea racemosa (0.8%), are lower than that of C. arabica. Young expanding leaves of C. arabica plants also contain caffeine, with traces of theobromine. In model systems, weak intermolecular complexes form between caffeine and polyphenols¹⁹, and it has been proposed that caffeine is sequestered in the vacuoles of coffee leaves as a chlorogenic acid complex²⁰. Mature leaves of C. liberica, C. dewevrei and Coffea abeokutae convert caffeine to the methyluric acids, theacrine (1,3,7,9-tetramethyluric acid), liberine [O(2),1,9-trimethyluric acid] and methylliberine [O(2),1,7,9-tetramethyluric acid] (Fig. 1).

Purine alkaloids are also present in the leaves of maté (Ilex paraguariensis), which is used in rural areas of South America, such as the Brazilian Pantanal and

the Pampas in Argentina, to produce a herbal tea (http://www.vtek.chalmers.se/~v92tilma/tea/mate.html). Young maté leaves contain 0.8–0.9% caffeine and 0.08–0.16% theobromine. Theobromine is the dominant purine alkaloid in seeds of cocoa (*Theobroma cacao*), with cotyledons of mature beans containing 2.2–2.7% theobromine and 0.6–0.8% caffeine. Caffeine (4.3%) is the major methylxanthine in cotyledons of guaraná (*Paullinia cupana*), extracts of which are used as a refreshing pick-me-up (http://www.rain-tree.com/guarana.htm) and which is, in a dilute form, sold extensively in Brazil as a carbonated drink. Seeds of cola (*Cola nitida*) also contain caffeine (2.2%). Caffeine has recently been detected in flowers of several citrus species, with the highest concentrations (0.2%) in pollen, and is also a fungal metabolite, being the principal alkaloid in sclerotia of *Claviceps sorhicola*, a Japanese ergot pathogen of *Sorghum*.

**Biosynthesis of purine alkaloids**

**Origin of the purine ring of caffeine**

Caffeine is a trimethylxanthine whose xanthine skeleton is derived from purine nucleotides that are converted to xanthosine, the first committed intermediate in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway. There are at least four routes from purine nucleotides to xanthosine (Fig. 4). The available evidence indicates that the most important routes are the production of xanthosine from inosine 5′-monophosphate, derived from de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis, and the pathway in which adenosine, released from S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH), is converted to xanthosine via adenine, adenosine 5′-monophosphate, inosine 5′-monophosphate and xanthosine 5′-monophosphate.

Recently published data indicate that the conversion of SAH to xanthosine is such that the

purine ring of caffeine can be produced exclusively by this route in young tea leaves. The formation of caffeine by this pathway is closely associated with the SAM cycle (also known as the activated-methyl cycle) because the three methylation steps in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway use SAM as the methyl donor (Fig. 4). During this process, SAM is converted to SAH, which in turn is hydrolysed to L-homocysteine and adenosine. The adenosine is used to synthesize the purine ring of caffeine and the L-homocysteine is recycled to replenish SAM levels. Because 3 moles of SAH are produced via the SAM cycle for each mole of caffeine that is synthesized, this pathway has the capacity to be the sole source of both the purine skeleton and the methyl groups required for caffeine biosynthesis in young tea leaves.

**Purine ring methylation**

Xanthosine is the initial purine compound in the caffeine biosynthesis pathway, acting as a substrate for the methyl group donated by SAM. Tracer experiments with labelled precursors and leaf discs from tea and coffee plants have shown that the major route to caffeine is xanthosine → 7-methylxanthosine → 7-methylxanthine → theobromine → caffeine, although alternative minor routes might also operate. However, as well as entering the caffeine biosynthesis pathway, xanthosine is also converted to xanthine, which is degraded to CO₂ and NH₃ via the purine catabolism pathway (Fig. 5).

labile, therefore achieving even partial purification has proved a difficult task²⁹. However, the purification of MXS from coffee leaves has been achieved¹⁷,¹⁸. The pH optimum of the purified enzyme was 7.0 and the Kₘ values for xanthosine and SAM were 22 μM and 15 μM, respectively. The next enzyme, methylxanthine nucleosidase, which has been partially purified from tea leaves, catalyses the hydrolysis of 7-methylxanthosine to 7-methylxanthine³⁰.

The activities of the N-methyltransferases that catalyse the conversions of 7-methylxanthine to theobromine and theobromine to caffeine were first shown in crude extracts of tea leaves by Takeo Suzuki and Ei-ichi Takahashi, 26 years ago³¹. However, like MXS, the activity is extremely labile and it was not until 1999 that an enzyme from young tea leaves was purified to apparent homogeneity³². This N-methyltransferase, caffeine synthase (CS), is monomeric, has an apparent molecular mass of 41 kDa and displays a sharp pH optimum of 8.5. It exhibits N-3- and N-1-methyltransferase activities, and a broad substrate specificity, showing high activity with paraxanthine, 7-methylxanthine and theobromine, and low activity with 3-methylxanthine and 1-methylxanthine (Table 1). Furthermore, the enzyme has no MXS activity towards either xanthosine or xanthosine-5'-monophosphate³². The Vₘₐₓ/Kₘ value of tea CS is highest for paraxanthine and so paraxanthine is the best substrate for CS (Ref. 32). However, there is limited synthesis of endogenous paraxanthine from 7-methylxanthine and therefore, *in vivo*, paraxanthine is not an important methyl acceptor²⁸.

The effects of the concentration of SAM and several methyl acceptors on the activity of CS show typical Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and there is no feedback inhibition by caffeine. It is therefore unlikely that allosteric control of the CS activity is operating in tea leaves. One of the major factors affecting the activity of CS *in vitro* appears to be a product inhibition by SAH. CS is inhibited completely by low concentrations of SAH. Therefore, control of the intracellular SAM:SAH ratio is one possible mechanism for regulating the activity of CS *in vivo*. CS is a chloroplast enzyme but CS activity is not affected by light *in situ* and caffeine is synthesized in the darkness³³.

Cloning of caffeine synthase and related genes

Using 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends with degenerate gene-specific primers based on the N-terminal residues of purified tea CS, a 1.31 kb sequence of cDNA has been obtained¹⁴. The 5' untranslated sequence of the cDNA fragment was isolated by 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The total length of the isolated cDNA, termed TCS1 (GenBank Accession No. AB031280), is 1438 bp and it encodes a protein of 369 amino acids. The deduced amino acid sequence of TCS1 shows low homology with other N-, S- and O-methyltransferases from plants and microorganisms, with the exception of

Fig. 6. Bacterial and higher plant caffeine catabolism pathways. The bar between caffeine and theophylline indicates a rate-limiting step in *Coffea arabica* and *Camellia sinensis*. As a consequence, caffeine accumulates in these species because it is converted to theophylline in only limited quantities. In bacteria, such as *Pseudomonas putida*, the initial degradation step is N-1-demethylation, which results in the conversion of caffeine to theobromine rather than theophylline. In higher plants, theobromine is a precursor rather than a catabolite of caffeine. Abbreviations: 1-NDM, N-1-demethylase; 3-NDM, N-3-demethylase; 7-NDM, N-7-demethylase.

and *Camellia* species that produce low levels of caffeine. In the case of *Coffea*, such material is available from species such as *C. eugenioides* but none are suitable for commercial exploitation because of the poor quality and bitter taste of the resultant beverage and/or the form and low productivity of the trees. There is also a similar situation with tea. Although a breeding programme to obtain low-caffeine-producing plants is feasible, there are genetic barriers and it would probably take 20 years or more to establish and stabilize the desired traits. In the circumstances, the use of genetic engineering to produce transgenic caffeine-deficient tea and coffee might ultimately be a more practical proposition.

The cloning of the CS gene is an important advance towards the production of transgenic caffeine-deficient tea and coffee through gene silencing with antisense mRNA or RNA interference. One potential complication is that antisense CS plants might accumulate 7-methylxanthine instead of caffeine. There are few studies of the clinical effects of 7-methylxanthine, although one recent study suggests that it can counter deterioration of eyesight in the elderly by improving the quality of sclera collagen³⁸. The situation is potentially more straightforward with the MXS gene because antisense expression will produce transgenic plants in which the conversion of xanthosine to 7-methylxanthosine is blocked. Xanthosine might not accumulate because it can be converted to xanthine, which will be degraded by the purine catabolism pathway (Fig. 5).

An alternative way to produce transgenic caffeine-deficient coffee and tea plants would be to overexpress a gene encoding an N-demethylase associated with the degradation of caffeine. Expression of the *Pseudomonas putida* N-1-demethylase activity in either *C. arabica* or *C. sinensis* is unlikely to result in caffeine deficiency because caffeine will be degraded to theobromine, which is the immediate precursor of caffeine in both species. However, expression of the N-7-demethylase encoding gene from *C. eugenioides* in transgenic tea and coffee plants is much more likely to lead to a reduced caffeine content because the *C. eugenioides* gene product will catalyse the metabolism of caffeine to theophylline, which the native enzymes will catabolize to CO₂ and NH₃ (Fig. 6). The future use of such material to produce fully flavoured caffeine-free tea and coffee will appeal to many consumers who wish to avoid the risks of adverse side effects associated with caffeine.

Consumption of decaffeinated tea should also be considered from a more long-term health prospective because it is possible that the protective effects of tea, especially green tea, against heart disease (which are attributed to catechins and related polyphenols^{39-42}) might be enhanced by a lack of the potentially hypertensive caffeine^{43,44}. It is also feasible that the reported anticancer effects of drinking tea^{45} would be amplified by an absence of caffeine.

The cloning of the caffeine biosynthesis genes also opens up the possibility of studying the cellular and subcellular localization of the N-methyltransferases and the molecular mechanisms that regulate the production of caffeine and, as such, will add an extra dimension to data already obtained in biochemical studies. Initial studies have shown that CS transcripts are commonest in young tea shoots and decline sharply as the leaves mature, in parallel with decreasing caffeine biosynthesis *in vivo*^{46}. More transcripts of *CTS1* and *CTS2* accumulate in young coffee leaves and flower buds than in mature and aged leaves^{15}. Similarly, *CaMXMT* transcripts accumulate in young leaves and stems but not roots and old leaves of coffee plants^{16}. The availability of transgenic caffeine-deficient *C. arabica* and *C. sinensis* plants should also enable the proposed roles of caffeine as a chemical protectant against insects and as an allelopathic agent to be thoroughly evaluated.
