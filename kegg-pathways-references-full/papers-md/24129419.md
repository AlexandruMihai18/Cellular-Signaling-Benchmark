# Regulation of RIP1 kinase signalling at the crossroads of inflammation and cell death

**Dimitry Ofengeim and Junying Yuan**

**Abstract |** Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase has emerged as a key upstream regulator that controls inflammatory signalling as well as the activation of multiple cell death pathways, including apoptosis and necroptosis. The ability of RIP1 to modulate these key cellular events is tightly controlled by ubiquitylation, deubiquitylation and the interaction of RIP1 with a class of ubiquitin receptors. The modification of RIP1 may thus provide a unique ‘ubiquitin code’ that determines whether a cell activates nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) to promote inflammatory signalling or induces cell death by apoptosis or necroptosis. Targeting RIP1 might be a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of both acute and chronic human diseases.

### Toll-like receptor (TLR)
A family of single membrane-spanning receptors that can be activated by structurally conserved molecules derived from microorganisms. They have a key role in innate immunity.

### Necroptosis
A caspase-independent necrotic cell death pathway that is controlled by receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase and its downstream mediator RIP3 kinase.

### Apoptosis
An evolutionarily conserved cell death mechanism that is executed by caspases.

Inflammation and cell death are crucial cellular processes that control organismal homeostasis and viability. Dysfunction of either process can result in a pathological mechanism that leads to a disease state. Although inflammation activated in response to harmful stimuli such as invasion of pathogens and tissue damage helps defend against infection, dysregulated chronic inflammation is an important underlying factor in many human diseases such as neurodegeneration, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, as well as cancer. Similarly, the activation of cell death pathways, which can be used to eliminate pathogen-infected cells as a part of the innate immune response, is also an important underlying mechanism for human diseases, including both acute and chronic neurodegenerative diseases.

Inflammation and cell death are intricately connected and can often be viewed as parallel processes that can positively regulate each other. In the context of this Review, we define inflammation as an aberrant organismal condition in which the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interferon-γ (IFNγ)) are increased in response to the invasion of pathogens, autoimmunity or the prolonged involvement of immune cells (monocytes, microglia and macrophages) in chronic neurodegenerative conditions. Elucidating the control of and reciprocal interactions between inflammation and cell death is crucial to understanding the mechanisms of human disease. In this regard,

Figure 1 | RIP1-mediated multimodal signalling events downstream of TNFR1. Upon binding to tumour necrosis factor (TNF), the cytoplasmic death domain of trimerized TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) recruits a membrane-associated complex, named complex I. This complex comprises the adaptor protein TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD), the death domain-containing protein kinase receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and several ubiquitin E3 ligases, including TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1), cIAP2 and the linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC; which is composed of haem-oxidized IRP2 ubiquitin ligase 1 (HOIL1), HOIL1-interacting protein (HOIP) and SHANK-associated RH domain-interacting protein (SHARPIN)). In complex I, RIP1 is rapidly polyubiquitylated by Lys63-linked and linear Met1-linked ubiquitin chains, which mediate the recruitment and activation of the TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and IkB kinase (IKK) complexes by ubiquitin binding. The phosphorylation and subsequent ubiquitin–proteasome system (UPS)-mediated degradation of inhibitor of κB (IkB) leads to the activation of nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB). TAK1 can also phosphorylate and activate the MAPKs. Subsequently, the activity of the deubiquitylation enzymes A20 and cylindromatosis (CYLD) disassembles complex I by deubiquitylating its components, including RIP1 and TRAF2, within 10–15 minutes after TNF stimulation. This leads to the formation of one of the two alternative cytosolic complexes, complex IIa or complex IIb. Complex IIa includes the adaptor FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD), caspase 8 and RIP1 and mediates the activation of caspase 8. This, in turn, activates downstream caspases, such as caspase 3 (not shown), ultimately leading to apoptosis. When the activation of caspase 8 is inhibited, RIP1 kinase is activated and binds to RIP3 to form complex IIb, which mediates the downstream events of necroptosis. The transition from complex I to complex II is an important regulatory step. By inhibiting RIP1 kinase activity, necrostatin 1 (not shown) can prevent the formation of complex IIb. In addition, FLICE-inhibitory protein (FLIP) is a crucial negative regulator of complex IIa and complex IIb by inhibiting the association of RIP1 with cytosolic complex II components.

of RIP1 signalling can lead to excessive inflammation or cell death, which makes RIP1 an important and attractive target for developing new therapies for human diseases involving inflammation and cell death. In this Review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the function and regulation of RIP1 kinase, with the goal of understanding how RIP1 accomplishes such complex and delicate control of alternative outcomes in an effective manner and how dysregulation of RIP1 kinase might lead to cellular damage, inflammation and degeneration in human diseases.

The domain structure of RIP1
RIP1, a member of the receptor-interacting Ser/Thr kinase family, contains an amino-terminal kinase domain, an intermediate domain and a carboxy-terminal death domain (FIG. 2). The N-terminal kinase domain of RIP1 is structurally similar to that of BRAF with a regulatory motif, known as the T-loop, comprising the conserved residues Asp-Leu-Gly, which is also found in BRAF as Asp-Phe-Gly4. Ser161 of RIP1 in the T-loop corresponds to Thr598 of BRAF, an allosteric regulatory site that controls the kinase activity by occluding the catalytic cleft to maintain the closed inactive conformation. The X-ray crystal structure of the RIP1 kinase domain shows a canonical kinase fold, with an N-lobe, a C-lobe and an intervening regulatory activation loop (T-loop)12. The ATP-binding pocket contains the conserved amino acids essential for ATP binding and hydrolysis, including the catalytic triad residues Lys45–Glu63–Asp156 and key residues (amino acids 136–143) involved in ATP binding.
The intermediate domain of RIP1 is subject to Lys63-linked ubiquitylation at Lys377, which may be an important part of the ‘ubiquitin code’. This code is recognized by and binds to many of the pro-survival ubiquitin-binding proteins (ubiquitin receptors) that engage RIP1 to mediate cell survival in nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent13,14 and -independent15 manners (FIG. 2). However, RIP1 can be ubiquitylated at multiple sites (see below) that have not been well defined or

Figure 2 | The domains and post-translational modifications of RIP1. The domain structure of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) consists of an amino-terminal kinase domain, a receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM)-containing intermediate domain and a carboxy-terminal death domain. The interacting small molecules and proteins are indicated underneath each domain. A large number of proteins interact with ubiquitylated Lys377 and possibly other putatively ubiquitylated Lys residues. Several post-translational modifications of RIP1 have known roles in the binding of necrostatin 1 (Ser161), ubiquitin-binding domain-containing proteins (Lys377) and complex IIb formation (Lys530). The death domain of RIP1 is crucial for the initiation of death receptor signalling and apoptosis, whereas the intermediate domain seems to be associated with nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signalling and necroptosis.

functionally characterized. Further investigation of the role of RIP1 ubiquitylation in terms of its signalling activity will be important to fully decipher the ubiquitin code of RIP1.

The intermediate domain also contains a receptor-interacting protein homotypic interaction motif (RHIM), which mediates interactions with other RHIM-containing proteins, such as RIP3 (a downstream mediator of RIP1 kinase in necroptosis (see below))¹⁶, the mouse cytomegalovirus RHIM-containing protein M45 (REF. 17), TRIF (TIR-domain-containing adaptor-inducing IFNβ)¹⁸ (FIG. 3) and the cytosolic IFN-inducible DNA receptor DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IRFs; also known as DLM1 or ZBP1)¹⁹. The RHIMs of RIP1 and RIP3 can form filamentous amyloid structures that are important for mediating necroptosis²⁰.

The C-terminal part of RIP1 is characterized by a six-helical bundle fold, known as the death domain (FIG. 2). This domain is also found in FAS, TNFR1, FAS-associated death domain protein (FADD) and TNFR1-associated death domain protein (TRADD)²¹. The death domain of RIP1 is involved in mediating homotypic protein–protein interactions for the association with death receptor signalling complexes at the cytoplasmic membrane upon ligand stimulation as well as for the formation of intracellular complexes to mediate downstream signalling, for example by interacting with the death domain of FADD to trigger apoptosis²².

**Signalling pathways mediated by RIP1**

**NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signalling.** Although RIP1 was initially proposed to mediate death receptor-induced apoptosis, RIP1-deficient Jurkat T cells (*RIPK1*-null allele) are specifically defective in the activation of NF-κB in response to TNF stimulation, but they are not defective in apoptosis mediated by FAS ligation. This indicates that RIP1 is required to mediate NF-κB activation but not apoptosis². Trimerization of TNFR1 by TNF brings together the TNFR1 cytoplasmic death domains and recruits TRADD,
which in turn recruits RIP1 and TNFR-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and/or TRAF5 (REFS 23–25) (FIG. 1). TRAF2 binds to the cellular inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (cIAP1 and cIAP2) and is responsible for their recruitment to TNFR1 (REFS 26,27). This protein complex associated with the intracellular domain of TNFR1 is known as complex I²⁸. Polyubiquitylation of RIP1 in complex I functions as docking sites for NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO; also known as IKKγ), TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1; also known as MAP3K7) and the TAK1-binding proteins (TAB1 and TAB2), which regulate the NF-κB-mediated inflammatory response (FIG. 1). These ubiquitin-driven protein–protein interactions may sequester RIP1 in a cellular microdomain that prevents it from mediating cell death and promotes NF-κB activation and cell survival⁹,¹⁰.

RIP1 is involved in mediating the inflammatory response following the activation of some TLRs (FIG. 3). RIP1 can modulate the intracellular responses downstream of TLR3 and TLR4, which involve two parallel pathways mediated by the adaptor proteins MYD88 (myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88) and TRIF. Whereas the MYD88 adaptor pathway is used by most TLRs, TRIF is specific to TLR3 and TLR4. TRIF contains a C-terminal RHIM that is important for the recruitment of RIP1 in response to TLR3 stimulation for mediating NF-κB activation²⁹,³⁰. The ubiquitylation of RIP1 downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 may involve the E3 ubiquitin ligase pellino 1 (PELI1)³¹. Consistent with this, genetic deletion of *Peli1* caused a specific attenuation of the TLR3- and TLR4-induced inflammatory response and rendered mice resistant to the lethal effects of lipopolysaccharide (LPS; a TLR4 ligand) and polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C); a TLR3 ligand).

Taken together, the results indicate that RIP1 has an important role in modulating inflammatory responses mediated by NF-κB. The kinase activity of RIP1 is not required for NF-κB activation, as neither a kinase-dead RIP1 mutant nor the pharmacological inhibition of RIP1 kinase activity has any effect on the TNF-stimulated

indicates that the kinase activity of RIP1 is required to activate a necrotic form of cell death in these cells. The subsequent identification and application of a specific RIP1 kinase inhibitor, necrostatin 1 (BOX 2), in a wide range of cellular and animal models led to the recognition of a common necrotic pathway regulated by RIP1 kinase, known as necroptosis^{4,6} (BOX 1).

Necrostatin 1 has been used as an effective tool to demonstrate the functional role of RIP1 kinase in necroptosis. The formation of complex IIb downstream of TNFR1 ligation, defined by the interaction between RIP1 and RIP3, requires RIP1 kinase activity as it is inhibited by necrostatin 1 (REFS 33–35) (BOX 2). The association between RIP1 and RIP3 is mediated by the RHIMs in both of these proteins, which have been shown to form amyloid fibrils^{20}. Thus, amyloid formation might be a key signalling event that mediates necroptosis. The functional significance of this amyloid structure in mediating pro-death and pro-inflammatory signalling is intriguing, given the involvement of amyloid formation in ageing-related chronic neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by cell death and inflammation. One can envision that an amyloid signalling platform could be important to sustain or amplify crucial signals that otherwise might be attenuated by protein degradation. Consistent with this notion, RIP1 is a relatively unstable protein, and thus integration into such a complex could stabilize a specific signalling motif of RIP1. The presence of amyloid in the signal transduction pathway of necroptosis might enable the crosstalk between these pathways involving amyloid formation and RIP1 kinase.

The exact mechanism as to why and how RIP1 kinase activity mediates the transition from complex I to complex IIb is still unknown, and the substrate for RIP1 has not been identified. It is possible that one of the key consequences of RIP1 kinase activation is autophosphorylation. This can occur at several sites, *in vitro*, including Ser14 or Ser15, and Ser20, Ser161 and Ser166 (FIG. 2). However, the functional significance of these phosphorylation sites has not been demonstrated *in vivo*. In addition, as RIP1 is prominently ubiquitylated in complex I following activation of TNFR1 and needs to be deubiquitylated for the transition into the cytoplasmic complex IIa or complex IIb, a possible relationship between ubiquitylation and deubiquitylation of RIP1 and its kinase activity remains to be investigated.

Taken together, the results show that a crucial cellular checkpoint following TNF-induced TNFR1 activation is mediated by the intrinsic kinase activity of RIP1: kinase-inactive RIP1 can regulate the activation of pro-survival pathways such as NF-κB signalling, whereas kinase-active RIP1 can activate necroptosis or, under specific conditions, apoptosis (see below). Ubiquitylation of RIP1 might provide an important mechanism to suppress RIP1 kinase activity. Thus, ubiquitylation or phosphorylation of RIP1 might represent a binary code that controls the downstream output of RIP1.

Although the molecular mechanism that leads to necroptosis has been best characterized downstream of death receptors, it should be noted that RIP1 also regulates similar parallel and/or alternative pathways downstream

by the loss of cIAP1 and cIAP2 that enables RIP1 kinase  
to mediate apoptosis is probably due to the state of RIP1  
ubiquitylation, which is important for the recruitment  
of certain key factors, such as the TAK1 complex (see  
below). Thus, RIP1 ubiquitylation is a crucial checkpoint  
downstream of receptor activation by pro-inflammatory  
and/or pro-death cytokines that determines whether a  
cell activates NF-κB-mediated transcription and lives or  
whether it dies through necroptosis or, on rare occasions,  
apoptosis. Dysregulation of these RIP1-regulated crucial  
cellular decisions can have detrimental consequences by  
causing damage to the tissue or organism.

**Regulation of RIP1 by ubiquitylation**

Ubiquitylation of RIP1 has a dominant role in promoting  
the activation of the NF-κB-mediated pro-inflammatory  
pathway and in suppressing the activation of RIP1 kinase  
activity. Ubiquitylation can occur through one of the eight  
diubiquitin linkage types: Lys6, Lys11, Lys27, Lys29, Lys33,  
Lys48, Lys63 or Met1. The attachment site on a target pro-  
tein, the different types of linkage and the ubiquitin chain  
length enable distinct signalling by forming complexes  
with different ubiquitin-binding proteins⁴⁴. Ubiquitylation  
of human RIP1 has been found to occur at Lys115, Lys570,  
Lys603 and Lys626 when RIP1 is overexpressed⁴⁵ and at  
Lys377 after TNF stimulation¹³,¹⁴, and at Lys115, Lys163–  
167 and Lys671 on endogenous RIP1 under unstimulated  
conditions⁴⁶ (FIG. 2). Consistent with the involvement of  
RIP1 in TNF-mediated signalling, mass spectrometry  
analysis of RIP1 purified from cellular TNFR1 complexes  
after TNF stimulation showed that RIP1 contains linear  
Met1-linked and Lys11-, Lys48- and Lys63-linked ubiq-  
uitin chains⁴⁷. As Lys48-linked polyubiquitin chains are  
recognized by the 26S proteasome, Lys48-linked ubiqui-  
tylation of RIP1 triggers its proteasomal degradation and  
functions to downregulate RIP1-mediated signalling.  
By contrast, Lys63-linked and linear ubiquitin chains of  
RIP1 have been shown to promote its signalling. RIP1  
is dynamically regulated by Lys48- and Lys63-linked  
ubiquitylation in response to TNF stimulation⁴⁸.

**Lys63-linked ubiquitylation.** Lys377 is an important site  
for Lys63-linked ubiquitylation of RIP1 (REFS 13,14). The  
direct mediators of RIP1 Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation  
following TNF stimulation are TRAF2, cIAP1 and cIAP2,  
which are recruited to TNFR1 (REFS 39,49,50) (FIG. 1). The  
Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chain (or chains) on RIP1  
functions as a docking site for the TAK1-TAB1-TAB2  
complex and for NEMO, both of which are activators of  
the NF-κB signalling pathway⁵¹⁻⁵³.

Although the role of RIP1 and the molecular mecha-  
nism involved in mediating the NF-κB-dependent pro-  
survival function have been best studied, RIP1 might also  
have a less well understood role in mediating cell survival  
in a NF-κB-independent manner. Intriguingly, *Ripk1*⁻/⁻  
MEFs have increased sensitivity to apoptosis compared  
with wild-type MEFs in response to TNF stimulation,  
even with the attenuation of NF-κB activation either by  
the addition of cyclohexamide or by transfection with  
IkB (inhibitor of κB) super-repressor¹⁵,⁴²,⁵⁴. Consistent  
with this possibility, *Ripk1*⁻/⁻ MEFs reconstituted with

Figure 3 | The involvement of RIP1 in TLR4 signalling. Stimulation of Toll-like  
receptor 4 (TLR4) by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) leads to the recruitment of the TLR  
signalling adaptors myeloid differentiation primary response protein 88 (MYD88) and  
TIR-domain-containing adaptor inducing IFNβ (TRIF) (via TRIF-related adaptor molecule  
(TRAM)), which leads to the activation of downstream pathways. MYD88 is recruited to  
all TLRs except for TLR3 and associates with IL-1R-associated kinases (IRAKs) and TNFR-  
associated factor 6 (TRAF6). Ubiquitylation of TRAF6 by its own enzymatic activity and by  
pellino 1 (PELI1) induces the recruitment of NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO) and  
TGFβ-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) complexes to the site of ubiquitylation and leads to the  
activation of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and MAPKs. The TRIF adaptor protein, which  
directly associates with TLR3 and indirectly via TRAM with TLR4, binds to receptor-  
interacting protein 1 (RIP1) and TRAF6 following receptor activation, which also leads  
to the activation of NF-κB and MAPKs. The TRIF signalling pathway can also lead to  
the transcription of type I interferons (IFNs) via an interferon regulatory factor 3  
(IRF3)-mediated pathway. Similar to the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) complex, signalling  
downstream of TLR3 and TLR4 is negatively regulated through A20- and cylindromatosis

of TLRs³⁶, the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I)  
complex in response to RNA viruses³⁷ and interferon  
receptors³⁸. Thus, RIP1 might function as a global cellu-  
lar sensor and/or regulator downstream of multiple cell  
surface receptors involved in regulating inflammation and  
cell death.

**Apoptosis.** Although RIP1 is found in the pro-apoptotic  
complex IIa downstream of TNFR1 activation (FIG. 1),  
it is not essential for death receptor-mediated caspase-  
dependent apoptosis². In fact, RIP1-deficient mouse  
embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) are more sensitive to  
TNF-mediated apoptosis³. RIP1 kinase activity is also  
not required for canonical death receptor-mediated apop-  
tosis induced by TNF in combination with the translation  
inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX)⁵,⁷. Interestingly, when  
RIP1 fails to be ubiquitylated — as first shown in cells  
expressing the Lys377Arg RIP1 mutant, in which an  
important ubiquitylation site is blocked — it becomes a  
pro-apoptotic signalling molecule by engaging caspase 8  
(REF. 15). Consistent with a crucial role of RIP1 ubiquityl-  
ation in preventing apoptosis, RIP1 kinase can mediate  
apoptosis following depletion of cIAP1 and cIAP2 by  
small-molecule IAP antagonists, known as Smac mimet-  
ics, during death receptor stimulation. Inhibition of RIP1  
kinase by necrostatin 1 or genetic knockout or knockdown  
of *RIPK1* can completely block apoptosis induced by TNF  
and Smac mimetics⁷,³⁹⁻⁴³. The unusual situation created

Apoptosis

Necroptosis

![Image](image2)

The electron microscopic images of apoptotic and necroptotic cells depict the morphological characteristics of apoptosis and necroptosis. Apoptosis is characterized by condensed cytosol, marginalized chromatin and nuclear fragmentation. Apoptosis requires caspases for its execution. This cell death pathway can be induced by caspase activation downstream of growth factor deprivation, DNA damage or ligands of the death receptor family, such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF), FAS and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Necroptosis is characterized by early plasma membrane permeabilization, translucent cytosol and swollen mitochondria. Necroptotic cells can be observed when cells are stimulated by pro-death signals, such as ligands of the death receptor family (including TNF, FAS or TRAIL), in the absence of caspase activation or *in vivo* after ischaemic injuries. Receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) kinase is required to mediate necroptosis signalling through the activation of RIP3, a downstream mediator of necroptosis.

The formation of linear ubiquitin chains helps to stabilize the native TNFR1 signalling complex by promoting the formation and retention of complex I — which includes TAK1, RIP1, cIAP1, cIAP2 and TRAF2 — to facilitate downstream signalling. Recruitment of the LUBAC to the TNFR1 complex depends on the formation of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains by TRADD–TRAF2–cIAP1–cIAP2. Once present in complex I, LUBAC forms linear polyubiquitin chains on RIP1 and NEMO to help the recruitment of downstream components. The UBAN (ubiquitin-binding in ABIN and NEMO) domain of NEMO has considerably higher affinity for linear ubiquitin linkages than for Lys63-linked and Lys11-linked chains<sup>58</sup>. This suggests that the linear ubiquitin linkages on RIP1 are also important for recruiting NEMO. NEMO in turn forms a complex with the kinase subunits of the IKK complex, IKKa and IKKβ, leading to the activation of IKKβ and subsequent activation of NF-κB.

The importance of linear ubiquitylation is underscored by studies reporting that knockdown of HOIL1 or HOIP, or mutations in *Sharpin*, in mice, impair the activation of NF-κB, leading to increased sensitivity to TNF-mediated cell death. Chronic proliferative dermatitis mutation mice (*cpdm* mice), which have a spontaneous null-mutation in *Sharpin*, develop chronic proliferative dermatitis (with similarity to psoriasis) at 4–6 weeks of age. Increased levels of apoptosis are observed in the skin of *cpdm* mice before the appearance of skin lesions. The inflammation in *cpdm* mice can be blocked by deficiency of TNF, which indicates that the *Sharpin* mutation leads to an inflammatory response mediated by TNF<sup>59,60</sup>. However, it is still not clear how this mutation might result in increased TNF production or whether RIP1 has a role in the regulation of this inflammatory response.

Thus, RIP1 is dynamically modified by a complex pattern of ubiquitylation, including multiple types of ubiquitin chain, such as Lys48- and Lys63-linked and linear Met1-linked chains, as well as ubiquitylation of different Lys residues. Whereas Lys48-linked ubiquitylation of RIP1 promotes its degradation, other types of ubiquitylation, including Lys63-linked and Met1-linked chains, have important functions in mediating RIP1 signalling. Understanding the regulation of different types of ubiquitylation on RIP1 and the mechanisms by which the downstream signals are transmitted by RIP1 ubiquitylation will provide important clues to decipher the ubiquitin code of RIP1 that controls its downstream signalling.

Linear Met1-linked ubiquitylation. Linear Met1-linked ubiquitin chains are another type of non-degradative signalling modification that might function as an important cellular regulator of both inflammatory and degenerative processes<sup>56</sup>.

RIP1 and positive regulators of NF-κB

NEMO and TAK1 are positive regulators of the NF-κB pathway that interact with ubiquitylated RIP1. After TNF stimulation, the recruitment of NEMO to ubiquitylated RIP1 provides a scaffold for the activation of both the IKK and TAK1 complexes (FIG. 1). This crucial docking step provides a necessary platform to initiate a robust inflammatory response. Thus, elucidating the mechanism of this interaction has important implications for our understanding of how RIP1 induces inflammation versus cell death.

Box 2 | Necrostatin 1

Necrostatin 1 was isolated in a cell-based high-throughput chemical screen for inhibitors of caspase-independent necrosis⁶. Although the original necrostatin 1 isolated from the screen, methyl-thiohydantoin-Trp (MTH-Trp), can inhibit indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) activity as well as receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) activity, an improved analogue of necrostatin 1, 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 (5-(7-chloro-1H-indol-3-yl)methyl)-3-methylimidazolidine-2,4-dione), has no IDO inhibitory activity⁸⁹,⁹⁰. In addition, 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 has enhanced in vivo pharmacokinetic properties and low toxicity and, therefore, is suitable for in vivo studies.

7-Cl-O-Nec-1 binds to a hydrophobic pocket between the N-lobe and C-lobe of the RIP1 kinase domain. This stabilizes RIP1 in an inactive conformation, known as the Asp-Leu-Gly-out (or Asp-Phe-Gly-out) conformation, through interactions with highly conserved amino acids in the activation loop and the surrounding structural elements¹². Point mutations, such as Ser161Ala and Ser161Glu, in RIP1 that alter the conformation of the RIP1 kinase T-loop and block H-bond formation with 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 prevent necrostatin 1-mediated inhibition of RIP1 activity and thereby necroptosis⁴. Thus, 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 is an excellent example of a type-II kinase inhibitor. This class of compounds occupies a hydrophobic pocket adjacent to the ATP-binding site of their target kinases to trap the kinase in an inactive, Asp-Phe-Gly-out state. They are mechanistically distinct from most kinase inhibitors that target the ATP site of the kinase in its active Asp-Phe-Gly-in state. Type II kinase inhibitors are known to have high selectivity and slower off-rates⁹¹. Consistent with this, 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 demonstrates exclusive selectivity towards RIP1, as it inhibits RIP1 kinase 1,000 times more potently than 485 other human kinases, including several other members of the RIP family, and it binds to RIP1 with high affinity (with a dissociation constant (K_d) of ~3 nM)³. 7-Cl-O-Nec-1 also targets RIP1 kinase specifically in vivo, as its ability to inhibit cell death is entirely dependent on the expression of RIP1 (REFS 3,4).

Interaction with the TAK1–TAB1–TAB2 complex. Lys63-linked ubiquitin chains on RIP1 have an important role in the activation of the TAK1 complex (TAK1–TAB1–TAB2). TAB2, which contains Lys63-linked ubiquitin-binding domains, binds to the Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains on RIP1 and NEMO⁵¹. The binding of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains by TAB2 induces a conformational change that activates this protein kinase. This, in turn, leads to the phosphorylation of IKKβ within its activation loop at Ser177 and Ser181 to initiate the activation of the IKK complex⁵⁵. The activated IKK complex mediates the phosphorylation of IkBa to promote its degradation⁶². TAK1 can then initiate NF-κB signalling through the activation of IKK complexes, as well as MAPK kinase 4 (MKK4) and MKK7, and MKK3 and MKK6, to mediate the activation of JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, respectively.

The function of TAK1 may not be limited to the activation of NF-κB as *Tak1⁻/⁻* mice die at an earlier embryonic stage than mice lacking NF-κB activation⁶³. Thus, TAK1 might have additional, NF-κB-independent functions during embryonic development. TAK1 may also be involved in maintaining the ubiquitylation of RIP1 in complex I, as deubiquitylation of RIP1 occurs much faster in *Tak1⁻/⁻* cells⁶⁴. Interestingly, genetic ablation of *Tak1* enables RIP1 kinase to control both caspase-dependent and -independent forms of cell death⁶⁴. Although the pan-caspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk (*N*-benzoyloxycarbonyl-valyl-alanyl-aspartyl-fluoromethylketone) can block the activation of caspase 3 in *Tak1⁻/⁻* MEFs, it does not block the cell death induced by TNF. Importantly, *Rip1* knockdown or the addition of necrostatin 1 can block cell death and caspase 3 activation, which indicates that RIP1 kinase controls both activities in *Tak1⁻/⁻* MEFs. Notably, in *Tak1⁻/⁻* MEFs, interaction between RIP1 and FADD occurred rapidly in response to TNF stimulation⁶⁴. Thus, in the absence of TAK1, RIP1 might be involved in caspase activation by directly binding to FADD and caspase 8 (FIG. 1).

In summary, Lys63-linked ubiquitylation of RIP1 functions as an important pro-survival and pro-NF-κB activation signal by providing docking sites for positive regulators of NF-κB. The interaction of RIP1 with these regulators, such as NEMO and the TAK1–TAB1–TAB2 complex, might stabilize the Lys63-linked ubiquitylation of RIP1, which further promotes cell survival and suppresses cell death.

Interaction with NEMO. The N-terminus of NEMO is required for the interaction with IKKα and IKKβ; the rest of the protein contains a series of coiled-coil domains (CC2), a Leu-rich zinc-finger and a C-terminal zinc-finger domain. A fragment of NEMO that contains a bipartite UBAN domain (encompassing the CC2, the Leu-rich zinc-finger and the zinc-finger domain) has high affinity and high specificity for Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains, such as those found on activated RIP1 (REF. 52). Similar bipartite UBAN domains can be found in ABIN1, ABIN2 and ABIN3 (also known as TNIP1, TNIP2 and TNIP3), as well as optineurin (OPTN), all of which interact with RIP1. As activated RIP1 is modified by both Lys63-linked and linear Met1-linked ubiquitin chains, it is possible that both types of RIP1 ubiquitylation contribute to the downstream signalling events.

In addition to mediating NF-κB activation through the IKK complex, NEMO binding to ubiquitylated RIP1 can enhance cell survival in both an NF-κB-dependent and -independent manner⁶¹. In response to TNF stimulation, cells lacking both NEMO and NF-κB had increased levels of caspase activation in a RIP1 kinase-dependent manner. As this death-promoting signalling role for RIP1 is only revealed when RIP1 ubiquitylation is disrupted or when its binding partner NEMO is absent, the ubiquitylation of RIP1 and its interaction with NEMO might have an active role in suppressing the activation of caspase 8 and hence cell death. It is possible that ubiquitylation of RIP1 and its binding to NEMO functions as an important checkpoint in inhibiting the activation of RIP1 kinase.

RIP1 and negative regulators of NF-κB

Polyubiquitylated RIP1 is a target of not only positive regulators of NF-κB, such as NEMO and the TAK1–TAB1–TAB2 complex, but also negative regulators of NF-κB, such as the ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 and the deubiquitylating enzyme cylindromatosis (CYLD) (FIG. 1). As RIP1 is subject to multiple types of ubiquitylation, which have crucial roles in mediating RIP1 signalling, it is not surprising that deubiquitylation functions as a major mechanism to inactivate RIP1 signalling. However, it is not clear what might be the mechanism that turns on the deubiquitylation activity to downregulate RIP1 signalling regulated by ubiquitylation.

**Editing of RIP1 ubiquitylation by A20.** A20, first identified as a negative regulator of NF-κB activation, is an important ubiquitin-editing enzyme that targets RIP1 (REF. 65). Expression of A20 is normally induced upon stimulation with TNF, IL-1β or LPS, and overexpression of A20 can protect certain cells from TNF-mediated apoptosis and necrosis⁶⁶. A20 functions as a dual ubiquitin-editing protein on Lys63-linked polyubiquitlated RIP1. The N-terminal deubiquitylase domain of A20 mediates the removal of Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIP1, and the C-terminal zinc-finger domain of A20 composed of seven C2C2 zinc-fingers, specifically the fourth zinc-finger, is involved in catalysing Lys48-linked polyubiquitylation of RIP1, thereby targeting it for proteasomal degradation⁶⁷. Regulation of RIP1 ubiquitylation by A20 is modulated by the A20-binding proteins TAX1BP1 (TAX1-binding protein 1), ITCH (E3 ubiquitin protein ligase Itchy homologue) and RNF11 (RING finger 11)⁶⁸. A20 is also implicated in regulating the NF-κB signalling pathway in response to TLR and IL-1 receptor signalling in a manner independent of RIP1 ubiquitylation by negatively regulating the activity of E3 ligases such as TRAF6, TRAF2, cIAP1 and cIAP2 (REF. 69).

In humans, **TNFAIP3**, the gene encoding A20, is a susceptibility locus for psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn’s disease⁷⁰. A20-deficient MEFs are hypersensitive to TNF-induced cell death with prolonged IKK activity and IκBa phosphorylation, leading to sustained NF-κB activation and enhanced cytokine production. A20-deficient mice develop massive inflammation and cachexia and die prematurely⁷¹. Mice with a myeloid cell-specific deficiency of A20 have a considerably increased production of TNF, IL-6 and nitric oxide, and they develop spontaneous arthritis that resembles human rheumatoid arthritis⁷². Destructive polyarthritis in myeloid cell-specific A20-deficient mice is TLR4–MYD88 dependent but TNF independent, which indicates that A20 has an important role in limiting TLR signalling in the myeloid cell lineage. It is not yet clear whether the interaction of A20 with RIP1 in the myeloid cell lineage is required to regulate TLR signalling or whether the interaction of A20 with another regulator of the pathway, such as TRAF6, might be important to restrain this inflammatory response.

**Regulation of RIP1 signalling by CYLD.** CYLD is another deubiquitylating enzyme that can interact with RIP1 and that negatively regulates NF-κB signalling (FIG. 1).

CYLD, first identified as a tumour suppressor protein, is mutated in patients with familial cylindromatosis⁷³. The loss-of-function mutation or disruption of the gene encoding CYLD leads to an impaired cell death phenotype⁷⁴⁻⁷⁶. CYLD interacts with NEMO to inhibit IKK and NF-κB by removing polyubiquitin chains from TRAF2, TRAF6 and NEMO, downstream of death receptor complexes. Furthermore, CYLD can deubiquitylate RIP1 (REF. 77), which might be important for CYLD to trigger both apoptosis and necroptosis³⁶. In addition, CYLD is negatively regulated by IKK-mediated phosphorylation⁷⁸,⁷⁹ and by caspase 8-mediated cleavage⁸⁰.

CYLD also negatively regulates TAK1 (REF. 81). T cells from *Cyl d⁻⁻* mice have constitutively active TAK1. Furthermore, *Cyl d⁻⁻* mice, similarly to A20-deficient mice, develop spontaneous intestinal inflammation. However, A20 is likely to have a broader function than CYLD, as A20-deficient mice die during the first two weeks of postnatal development, whereas *Cyl d⁻⁻* mice are viable into adulthood. Although both A20 and CYLD have been proposed to target RIP1 kinase activity, knockdown of CYLD, but not A20, could protect against necroptosis³⁶. This dichotomy may be explained by their substrate specificity, expression pattern and/or subcellular localization. In summary, deubiquitylation of RIP1 functions to modulate RIP1 kinase activity and/or its protein levels. A reduction in RIP1 deubiquitylation might lead to the activation of an inflammatory response and/or suppression of RIP1 kinase activation.

**Cleavage of RIP1 by caspase 8**

Deficiency in FADD or caspase 8 leads to embryonic lethality around day 10.5 which can be rescued by the loss of either RIP1 or RIP3 (REFS 82–84). This indicates that the RIP1–RIP3 axis is negatively regulated during embryonic development by caspase 8 and/or FADD. RIP1 is cleaved after Asp324 by caspase 8 during apoptosis induced by the activation of death receptors⁸⁵ (FIG. 4) and during RIG-I-mediated antiviral responses³⁷. Deletion of caspase 8 from basal epidermal keratinocytes triggers chronic skin inflammation in mice through the activation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1)⁸⁶. Thus, caspase 8 has an anti-inflammatory role by cleaving RIP1 to limit the antiviral response under non-apoptotic conditions.

Caspase 8-mediated cleavage of RIP1 also has an important role in maintaining the integrity of the intestinal epithelium by regulating the innate immune response. Mice that have an intestinal epithelium-specific

deletion of caspase 8 spontaneously develop inflammatory lesions in the terminal ileum with compromised survival of Paneth cells and goblet cells and have increased susceptibility to colitis<sup>87</sup>. Thus, caspase 8 is likely to have an important role in limiting the activation of RIP1 and RIP3 in these cells. Necroptosis of Paneth cells can be inhibited by necrostatin 1 or by RIP3 deficiency.

RIP1 also modulates the inflammatory response mediated by TLR3 or TLR4 activated by LPS or poly(I:C), respectively. Interestingly, the activation of either of these receptors in the presence of zVAD.fmk leads to cell death that can be inhibited by necrostatin 1 (REFS 36,88). This suggests that caspase activation in the context of TLR signalling has a pro-survival function by restraining the activation of RIP1 kinase. To summarize, restricted and localized activation of caspases might have an important function under non-apoptotic conditions to restrain the activation of RIP1 kinase and prevent the activation of inflammation and necroptosis.

**Conclusion**

The studies described here show a crucial role for RIP1 in controlling inflammatory responses and cell death. RIP1 is strategically situated at the crossroads of apoptosis, necroptosis and NF-κB signalling, and thereby has a key role in transmitting and interpreting extracellular signals to activate different downstream signalling pathways with distinct outcomes. As the activity of RIP1 is determined by its ubiquitylation status — by Lys48-linked, Lys63-linked and linear Met1-linked ubiquitylation in a site-specific and time-dependent manner — the ubiquitylation pattern of RIP1 might provide a ubiquitin code that interacts with ubiquitin-binding receptors, such as NEMO, TAB2 and A20, to propagate downstream signalling. We suggest that exploring and understanding the dynamics of the RIP1 ubiquitin code, its interactions with different types of ubiquitin receptor and the potential significance of other types of post-translational modification of RIP1, such as phosphorylation and acetylation, may provide new insights into the mechanisms by which RIP1 controls a multitude of cellular pathways and the implications for human diseases.

As discussed in this Review, RIP1 controls multiple downstream signalling pathways activated by TNF, including the NF-κB pathway, apoptosis and necroptosis. A major output of the RIP1-regulated pathways is an inflammatory response, as defined by the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, which can be mediated in an NF-κB-dependent or -independent manner. The activation of necrotic cell death might also lead to increased inflammation due to the leakage of intracellular content during cell death. Thus, inhibition of RIP1 kinase activation by necrostatin 1 blocks inflammation due to necrosis. However, increasing evidence suggests that RIP1 also mediates an inflammatory response in the absence of cell death. A genome-wide siRNA screen for genes involved in RIP1-regulated necroptosis induced by the pancaspase inhibitor zVAD.fmk identified several canonical pathways that are highly enriched for genes known to be involved in innate immunity, including the genes that are prominently involved in TNFR1, TLR and interferon pathways<sup>36</sup>, suggesting that RIP1 might have a central role in regulating innate immunity and inflammation. Understanding the roles of and mechanisms by which RIP1 regulates the inflammatory response will be a major area of immediate interest. Targeting RIP1 kinase might provide a crucial new therapeutic strategy for human diseases characterized by inflammation and cell death.
