Previously, we demonstrated that sog9 cells, a murine L cell mutant, are deficient in the expression of C4ST (chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferase)-1 and that they synthesize fewer and shorter CS (chondroitin sulfate) chains. These results suggested that C4ST-1 regulates not only 4-O-sulfation of CS, but also the length and amount of CS chains; however, the mechanism remains unclear. In the present study, we have demonstrated that C4ST-1 regulates the chain length and amount of CS in co-operation with ChGn-2 (chondroitin N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase 2). Overexpression of ChGn-2 increased the length and amount of CS chains in L cells, but not in sog9 mutant cells. Knockdown of ChGn-2 resulted in a decrease in the amount of CS in L cells in a manner proportional to ChGn-2 expression levels, whereas the introduction of mutated C4ST-1 or ChGn-2 lacking enzyme activity failed to increase the amount of CS. Furthermore, the non-reducing terminal 4-O-sulfation of *N*-acetylgalactosamine residues facilitated the elongation of CS chains by chondroitin polymerase consisting of chondroitin synthase-1 and chondroitin-polymerizing factor. Overall, these results suggest that the chain length of CS is regulated by C4ST-1 and ChGn-2 and that the enzymatic activities of these proteins play a critical role in CS elongation.

Key words: chondroitin sulfate, glycosaminoglycan, glycosyltransferase, proteoglycan, sulfotransferase.

### INTRODUCTION

CS (chondroitin sulfate) is a class of GAG (glycosaminoglycan) that is widely distributed on the surface of cells and within the extracellular matrix. CS is covalently linked to specific serine residues of core proteins and occurs as CS PGs (proteoglycans). CS moieties vary considerably in the size and number of GAG chains per core protein and in the position and degree of sulfation; therefore these highly variable moieties are able to store a massive amount of information and exert a variety of biological functions [1,2]. CS and characteristic CS chains exert their specific functions in a tissue- and cell-type-specific manner, suggesting that sulfation and polymerization of CS chains are strictly regulated. A previous study suggested that CS elongation is associated with increased binding of atherogenic lipids and atherosclerosis [3]. Moreover, deficiency in SLC35D1 (solute carrier 35D1), which encodes an endoplasmic reticulum nucleotide-sugar transporter, caused shortening of CS chains and led to skeletal dysplasias [4]. Therefore an understanding of the CS chain elongation mechanism is essential for elucidating multiple pathogenic mechanisms.

Multiple glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases are responsible for the biosynthesis of CS [5] (Figure 1). The synthesis of the linkage tetrasaccharide sequence, the so-called GAG-protein linkage region (GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser), is initiated by the addition of a xylose (Xyl) residue to a specific serine (Ser) residue in the core protein, followed by the sequential transfer of galactose (Gal) residues, and completed by the addition of the glucuronic acid (GlcA) residue [5]. Following completion of the synthesis of the linkage tetrasaccharide sequence, polymerization of repeating disaccharide units occurs by the alternate transfer of GlcA and GalNAc (*N*-acetylgalactosamine) [5]. Then, a number of sulfotransferases modify the chondroitin backbone with sulfate at positions 4 and 6 of the GalNAc residues and position 2 of the GlcA residues, resulting in structural diversity of CS moieties [6].

To date, six homologous glycosyltransferases, ChSy (chondroitin synthase)-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3, ChPF (chondroitin-polymerizing factor), and ChGn (chondroitin *N*-acetylgalactosamine transferase)-1 and -2, all of which are probably responsible for CS biosynthesis, have been cloned by us and others [7–14]. We have demonstrated chondroitin polymerization with alternating GalNAc and GlcA residues when any two of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3 and ChPF were co-expressed [8–10] (Figure 1). ChGn-1 and -2 are thought to catalyse chain initiation and elongation, exhibiting activities of GalNAcT (β1,4-*N*-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase)-I and -II [11–14] (Figure 1). In addition, seven sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of CS have been cloned to date [6]. Four sulfotransferases that catalyse sulfation of position 4 of the GalNAc residue have been cloned. C4ST (chondroitin 4-O-sulfotransferases)-1, -2 and -3 are responsible for the sulfation of position 4 of GalNAc residues in CS, whereas D4ST (dermatan 4-O-sulfotransferase)-1 catalyses the transfer of a sulfate residue to GalNAc residues next to IdoA (iduronic acid) in DS (dermatan sulfate) [15–19] (Figure 1).

Figure 1 Biosynthesis of CS  

CS is synthesized as PGs on specific serine residues in the GAG-protein linkage region, GlcAβ1-3Galβ1-3Galβ1-4Xylβ1-O-Ser. Following completion of the synthesis of the linkage tetrasaccharide sequence, the transfer of a single GalNAc residue to the tetrasaccharide linkage region by any two of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3 and ChPF (continuous arrow), or by ChGn-1 and -2 (broken arrow) initiates the assembly of CS. Polymerization then occurs through alternate addition of GlcA and GalNAc by any two of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3 and ChPF. Following synthesis of the backbone of CS, modifications of the precursor CS chains are conducted by various sulfotransferases. The first modifications, 4-O-sulfation or 6-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues, are catalysed by 4-O-sulfotransferases (C4ST-1, -2 and -3, and D4ST-1) or 6-O-sulfotransferase (C6ST-1) respectively. Thereafter, 2-O-sulfation of GlcA or 6-O-sulfation of GalNAc(4S) residues are catalysed by uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase or GalNAc4S-6ST respectively.

sulfate to position 6 of the GalNAc residue [20,21]. Uronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase catalyses the 2-O-sulfation of GlcA and IdoA. GalNAc4S-6ST (N-acetylgalactosamine 4-sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase) transfers a sulfate residue to position 6 of GalNAc(4S) formed by C4ST [22] (Figure 1).

Previously, we demonstrated that sog9 mutant cells were deficient in the expression of C4ST-1 and synthesized shorter CS chains with low 4-O-sulfation levels and that overexpression of C4ST-2 or D4ST-1 in sog9 cells did not lead to an increase in the chain length or amount of CS [23]. In addition, C4ST-1-deficient mice showed a 90% decrease in GalNAc(4S) structures and a severe reduction in the amount of CS [24]. These results suggested that C4ST-1 regulates CS 4-O-sulfation, chain length and amount; moreover, other C4ST/D4ST family members, including C4ST-2 and D4ST-1, does not compensate for the loss of C4ST-1. Therefore the 4-O-sulfation of CS chains by C4ST-1 may facilitate the elongation of CS chains; however, the C4ST-1 mechanism remains elusive. We hypothesized that 4-O-sulfation of non-reducing terminal GalNAc formed by ChGn-1 or -2 markedly enhances the elongation of CS chains by chondroitin polymerases. In the present paper, we report that C4ST-1 co-operates with ChGn-2 in CS chain elongation.

Site-directed mutagenesis

A two-stage PCR mutagenesis method was used to construct separate ChGn-2 and C4ST-1 mutants. Two separate PCRs were performed to generate two overlapping gene fragments using the full-length form of ChGn-2 or C4ST-1 cDNA as a template. In the first PCR, the sense 5′-primer described above and the antisense internal mutagenic primer listed below was used: ChGn-2D184A 5′-AAATAGATATCAACACAGCACAGAAAAACATC-3′ (the mutated nucleotides are underlined and in bold). In the second round of PCR, the sense internal mutagenic primer (complementary to the antisense internal mutagenic primer) and the antisense 3′-primer described above were used. In the case of C4ST-1, the sense 5′-primer (5′-GAAGATCTAGGACAAAGCCATGAAGCCGGC-3′) and the antisense internal mutagenic primer C4ST-1 R586A 5′-CTCGAAGGGTTCCGCCCACGAACAGGAA-3′ (the mutated nucleotides are underlined and in bold) were used. In the second round of PCR, the sense internal mutagenic primer (complementary to the antisense internal mutagenic primer) and the antisense 3′-primer (5′-ATAACCAGTCTCCATAGAATTCTTTGA-3′) were used. These two PCR products were gel-purified and then used as a template for a third PCR containing the sense 5′-primer and the antisense 3′-primer described above. The final PCR fragment was subcloned into the BamHI site or BamHI/EcoRI site of the pCMV expression vector respectively (Invitrogen). The fidelity of the plasmid constructs (pCMV-ChGn-2D367A and pCMV-C4ST-1R186A) was confirmed by DNA sequencing.

Quantitative real-time RT–PCR

Total RNA was extracted from L and sog9 cells using TRIzol® reagent (Invitrogen). The cDNA was synthesized from ~1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukaemia virus reverse transcriptase (Promega) and an oligo(dT)₂₀-M4 adaptor primer (TaKaRa). The primer sequences used were as follows: ChGn-1, forward primer 5′-AGAAGAAA-TAAATGAAGTCAAAGGAATAC-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAAGTAGATGTCCACATCACAG-3′; and ChGn-2, forward primer 5′-CCTAGAATCTGTGCACCAGT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GTTAAGGAATTCGGCTGAGAAATA-3′; and GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), forward primer 5′-CATCTGAGGGCCCCACTG-3′ and reverse primer 5′-GAGG-CCATGTAGGCCCATGA-3′. Quantitative real-time RT–PCR was performed using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I (Roche) in a LightCycler ST300 (Roche). The expression levels of ChGn-1 or ChGn-2 mRNA were normalized to that of the GAPDH transcript.

Derivatization of GAGs from L and sog9 cells using a fluorophore, 2-aminobenzamide

GAGs from L and sog9 cells were prepared as described previously [23,27]. The purified GAG fraction was digested with chondroitinase ABC, and the digests were then derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and analysed by HPLC as described previously [23].

Gel-filtration chromatography of GAGs

To determine the chain length of GAGs, the purified GAG fraction was subjected to reductive β-elimination using NaBH₄/NaOH, and then analysed by gel-filtration chromatography on a Superdex™ 200 column (10mm×300mm) eluted with 0.2M NH₄HCO₃ at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min. Fractions were collected at 3-min intervals, freeze-dried and digested with chondroitinase

ABC. The digests were derivatized with 2-aminobenzamide and then analysed by HPLC on an amine-bound PA-03 column [28].

### Polymerization assay and identification of polymerization reaction products

The ChSy-1 and ChPF expression plasmids (3.0 μg each) were co-transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm plates using FuGENE® 6 as described previously [10]. At 2 days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose (GE Healthcare) for 1 h at 4°C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with, and resuspended in, the assay buffer and then tested for N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity, as described previously [29]. The oligosaccharides used are listed in Table 1. Polymerization reactions using Oligo-1, Oligo-2, Oligo-5 and Oligo-6 as acceptors were co-incubated in reaction mixtures containing the following constituents in a total volume of 20 μl: 1 nmol of Oligo-1, -2, -5 or -6, 0.25 mM UDP-GalNAc, 0.25 mM UDP-[14C] GlcA (3 × 10^5 d.p.m.), 100 mM Mes (pH 6.5), 10 mM MnCl₂ and 10 μl of the resuspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 37°C overnight. The products of the polymerization reactions were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 75 column with 0.25 M NH₄HCO₃/0.7% propan-1-ol as the eluent.

### Expression of the soluble forms of recombinant C4ST-1 and C4ST-2 and identification of reaction products

Each expression plasmid (6.0 μg) was transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm-diameter plates using FuGENE® 6 according to the manufacturer's instructions and as described previously [19]. At 2 days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG-Sepharose for 1 h at 4°C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with and then resuspended in the assay buffer, and tested for sulfotransferase activity. Assays for sulfotransferase were described previously [19] with slight modifications. Briefly, the standard reaction mixture (30 μl) contained 10 μl of resuspended beads, 50 mM imidazole/HCl (pH 6.8), 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM [35S] PAPS (3 × 10^5 d.p.m.), and 1 nmol of Oligo-3 or Oligo-4 as an acceptor substrate respectively. The reaction mixtures were incubated at 37°C overnight and gel-filtered using a syringe column packed with Sephadex G-25 (superfine) [30]. The radioactive fractions containing the enzyme reaction products were pooled and desiccated. The isolated reaction product was digested with chondroitinase AC-II. The products of enzymatic digestion were analysed using the Superdex™ peptide column with 0.25 M NH₄HCO₃/0.7% propan-1-ol as the eluent.

### RESULTS

#### Introduction of ChGn-1 or ChGn-2 into sog9 and L cells

To examine whether ChGn-1 or ChGn-2 collaborates with C4ST-1 to regulate the length of CS chains, overexpression of ChGn-1 or ChGn-2 in L and sog9 cells was carried out. A pCMV-Script expression vector harbouring the open reading frame of human ChGn-1 or ChGn-2 was transfected into sog9 or L cells, and the neomycin analogue G418 was used to select transfected cells. Each of the resultant transfected colonies was picked and propagated for experiments, and the expression of ChGn-1 or ChGn-2 in the cells was measured by quantitative real-time RT-PCR. As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the composition of the disaccharides and the amount of CS isolated from the stable clones, designated L-ChGn-1, L-ChGn-2, sog9-ChGn-1 and sog9-ChGn-2 cells, were determined by HPLC.

were analysed by HPLC (Table 3). The amount of CS and the disaccharide composition in sog9-C4ST-1 R186A cells were similar to those in control sog9 cells (Table 3).

We next compared the length of CS chains obtained from sog9-C4ST-1-1 [23], sog9-C4ST-1 R186A-1 and mock-transfected sog9 cells. Gel-filtration analysis using a Superdex™ 200 column revealed that CS chains in sog9-C4ST-1-1 cells were longer than those in sog9-C4ST-1 R186A-1 or control sog9 cells (Figure 2C). The mean molecular masses were 101 (sog9-C4ST-1-1), 78 (sog9-C4ST-1 R186A-1) and 79 kDa (control sog9 cells) respectively (Figure 2C). Notably, the length of CS chains in sog9-C4ST-1 R186A-1 was comparable with that in sog9 cells (Figure 2C). These findings indicated that CS levels were not rescued by introduction of the mutated C4ST-1 R186A; therefore the enzymatic activity of both ChGn-2 and C4ST-1 was necessary to regulate the amount and chain length of CS.

### Involvement of non-reducing terminal GalNAc(4S) structure in chondroitin polymerization

We predicted that the non-reducing terminal 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues that are newly synthesized by C4ST-1 and ChGn-2 may facilitate the elongation of CS chains by the chondroitin polymerases that synthesize the CS backbone. Previously, we demonstrated that chondroitin polymerization occurred when any two of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3 and ChPF were co-expressed [8–10] (see Figure 1). Hence, polymerization activity was measured using Oligo-1, -2, -5 or -6 as acceptor substrates and ChSy-1 co-expressed with ChPF as the initial enzyme source. Each reaction product obtained with Oligo-1, -2, -5 or -6 was analysed by gel-filtration chromatography using a Superdex™ 75 column, as shown in Figure 3(A). The chondroitin chains synthesized on Oligo-5 were much longer than those synthesized on Oligo-1, -2 or -6. In contrast, no polymerization was induced on these acceptor oligosaccharides when co-expressed ChSy-1 and ChSy-2, ChSy-1 and ChSy-3, ChSy-2 and ChSy-3, ChSy-2 and ChPF, or ChSy-3 and ChPF were used (see Supplementary Figure S1 and Supplementary Table S1 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/434/bj4340321add.htm). Interestingly, although ChSy-1 and ChPF mRNA were expressed in both L and sog9 cells, ChSy-2 and ChSy-3 mRNA were hardly expressed in these cell lines (see Supplementary Figure S2 at http://www.BiochemJ.org/bj/434/bj4340321add.htm). These results indicated that chondroitin polymerization by the ChSy-1/ChPF enzyme complex was facilitated by the non-reducing terminal GalNAc(4S) structure (Figure 3B).

### Substrate specificity of C4ST-1 for the non-reducing terminal GalNAc

Previously, it has been reported that C4ST-1 catalyses the transfer of sulfate from PAPS to position 4 of the internal GalNAc residue of chondroitin [18,19]; however, it is not clear whether C4ST-1 is also responsible for transferring the sulfate to position 4 of the non-reducing terminal GalNAc residue. Hence, we examined the sulfotransferase activity of C4ST-1 at a non-reducing terminal GalNAc residue. However, C4ST-1 did not use the trisaccharide GalNAcβ1-4GlcAβ1-3GalNAc as a substrate. Then, the sulfotransferase activity was determined using longer oligosaccharides such as Oligo-3 or -4 as the acceptor substrates and \[^{35}S\]PAPS as the donor substrate. The \[^{35}\]S-labelled products were digested exhaustively with chondroitinase AC-II, which cleaves the β1-4-N-acetylgalactosaminidic linkage; two radioactive peaks were detected at the GalNAc-4-O-SO₄ and ΔDi-4S positions

in L cells. As shown in Table 2, the amount and disaccharide composition of CS isolated from each of the representative stable clones were similar to control L cells. These results indicated that the N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferase activity of ChGn-2 played an essential role in increasing CS levels.

Next, to verify that the sulfotransferase activity of C4ST-1 contributed to CS chain elongation, the C4ST-1 mutant, which lacks sulfotransferase activity, was overexpressed in sog9 cells. The mutated form of C4ST-1 (C4ST-1 R186A), which fails to bind PAPS, was described previously [32]. The disaccharide composition and the amount of CS in C4ST-1 R186A cells

In contrast, overexpression of ChGn-1 in sog9 cells increased the total amount of CS and the proportion of ΔDi-4S units compared with that in controls and in sog9 cells overexpressing ChGn-2 (Table 3). These results suggested that the function of ChGn-1 was different from that of ChGn-2. Previously, it was revealed that C4ST-1 mRNA is not expressed in sog9 cells, whereas C4ST-2 and D4ST-1 mRNA are expressed [23]. Thus ChGn-1 regulation of the amount of CS through its co-operation with C4ST-2 and/or D4ST-1 was expected. Comparative analysis of ChGn-1- [33] and ChGn-2-knockout mice would provide further insight into the distinct functions of these genes.

In *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster*, CS is synthesized as non-sulfated chondroitin and 4-O-sulfated CS respectively [34,35]. Additionally, in *C. elegans*, there is a single orthologue for each of ChSy and ChPF, but none for ChGn-1 or -2, despite the existence of chondroitin in the nematode [36]. In fact, the ChSy and ChPF orthologues are sufficient to synthesize chondroitin, and the system for chondroitin biosynthesis in *C. elegans* seems to be simpler than those in *D. melanogaster* and mammals [37]. On the other hand, there is a single orthologue for each of ChSy, ChPF and ChGn in *D. melanogaster*. Our group showed previously that the mean chain length of chondroitin in *C. elegans* is short (~40 kDa) and that of CS in *D. melanogaster* is ~70 kDa [34,35]. These results, together with those of the present study, strongly suggested that the GalNAc-4-O-sulfation of CS chains by C4ST and ChGn facilitated the elongation of CS chains by a chondroitin polymerase (e.g. the ChSy–ChPF complex) which is involved in synthesizing the CS backbone. Hence, we predicted that the diverse size of CS chains per core protein is strictly regulated not only by chondroitin polymerase, but also by CS sulfotransferases and N-acetylgalactosaminyltransferases. In addition, we suggest that these mechanisms are highly conserved through evolution.

Earlier studies have indicated that the sulfation of GAG chains ordinarily occurs in conjunction with polymerization at a single Golgi site and that there appears to be close interrelationships between sulfation and polymer elongation/termination [38]. In fact, our previous findings revealed that specific sulfate groups have either stimulatory or inhibitory effects on GalNAc transfer, and, consequently, sulfation reactions indeed play important roles in chain elongation and termination [29,39]. In addition, we reveal in the present study that the non-reducing terminal 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues synthesized by C4ST-1 and ChGn-2 facilitated the elongation of CS chains through chondroitin polymerase consisting of ChSy-1 and ChPF (Figures 3 and 5). In this regard, it should be noted that there is a progressive decrease in 4-sulfation to 4,6-disulfation of GalNAc residues on the non-reducing terminal residues of CS in human cartilage during development [40]. Moreover, the CS chains on aggrecan isolated from human cartilage become shorter with age [40]; therefore we suggest that the prior specific sulfation patterns in growing CS chains profoundly affected chain elongation and termination.

Previously, it was demonstrated that human lung fibroblasts treated with TGFβ (transforming growth factor β) alone or in combination with EGF (epidermal growth factor) and PDGF (platelet-derived growth factor) increased the production of CS PG and the activity of C4ST-1 [41]. In addition, it was reported that TGFβ or PDGF treatment of arterial smooth muscle cells results in the elongation of CS chains [3,42,43]. CS elongation is reported to be associated with increased binding of atherogenic lipids and atherosclerosis progression [3]. We demonstrated that C4ST-1 regulated the chain length and amount of CS in co-operation with ChGn-2; therefore these mitogens might promote the elongation of CS by controlling the expression of relevant

region tetrasaccharide sequence. However, the present study demonstrated that overexpression of ChGn-2 increased CS amounts and chain lengths, but overexpression of a mutated ChGn-2 lacking enzymatic activity failed to increase the amount of CS in L cells. Thus ChGn-2 was involved in the chain-elongation mechanism of CS, and its enzymatic function played an important role in this chain elongation.

Figure 5 Models of CS chain elongation by ChGn-2 and C4ST-1

(A) In the case of GlcA on the termini, the transfer of GalNAc to the disaccharide-repeating region by ChGn-2 is a trigger of further CS chain elongation. 4-O-sulfation of the non-reducing terminal GalNAc residue then takes place by C4ST-1. Finally, the non-reducing terminal 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues facilitates the elongation of CS chains through chondroitin polymerase consisting of ChSy-1 and ChPF.

(B) In the case of GalNAc on the termini, the action of C4ST-1 is followed by the transfer of GlcA by the enzyme complex of ChSy-1 and ChPF. Next, ChGn-2 transfers GalNAc to the non-reducing terminal GlcA and 4-O-sulfation of the non-reducing terminal GalNAc residue takes place by C4ST-1. Finally, the non-reducing terminal 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residues facilitates the elongation of CS chains through chondroitin polymerase consisting of ChSy-1 and ChPF.

enzymes, such as C4ST-1 and ChGn-2. Thus understanding the mechanisms that regulate the expression of C4ST-1 and ChGn-2 during atherosclerosis progression may lead to the identification of potential therapeutic targets for intervention in the pathological process of atherosclerosis.

**Figure S1** Comparison of chondroitin-polymerizing activity using various combinations of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3 and ChPF

Combinations of ChSy-1 and ChPF (○), ChSy-1 and ChSy-2 (▲), ChSy-1 and ChSy-3 (●), ChSy-2 and ChSy-3 (□), ChSy-2 and ChPF (■), or ChSy-3 and ChPF (△) were tested as an enzyme source for polymerization reactions using the non-sulfated hexasaccharide Oligo-2 (A), the non-sulfated pentasaccharide Oligo-1 (B), or the 4-O-sulfated pentasaccharide Oligo-5 (C). ${}^{14}$C-labelled polymerization reaction products were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 75 column with 0.25 M NH₄HCO₃/0.7 % propan-1-ol as the eluent. Numbered arrowheads 20K, 10K, 5K and 14 indicate the eluted position of 20, 10 and 5 kDa saccharides and tetradecasaccharides derived from chondroitin respectively. The total volume was at fraction ~60 (not shown).

Expression levels of chondroitin synthase and sulfotransferase gene family were normalized to those of GAPDH. Results are means ± S.E.M. for three experiments.

**SUPPLEMENTARY METHODS**

**Polymerization assay and identification of polymerization reaction products**

Any two of ChSy-1, ChSy-2, ChSy-3 and ChPF expression plasmids (3.0 μg each) were co-transfected into COS-1 cells on 100-mm-diameter plates using FuGENE® 6 as described previously [1–3]. At 2 days after transfection, 1 ml of the culture medium was collected and incubated with 10 μl of IgG–Sepharose for 1 h at 4 °C. The beads recovered by centrifugation were washed with, and resuspended in, the assay buffer, and then tested for GalNAc transferase activity, as described [4]. Polymerization reactions using Oligo-1, Oligo-5 and Oligo-2 as acceptors were co-incubated in reaction mixtures containing the following constituents in a total volume of 20 μl: 1 nmol of Oligo-1, Oligo-2 or Oligo-5, 0.25 mM UDP-GalNAc, 0.25 mM UDP-[${}^{14}$C]GlcA (3 × 10⁵ d.p.m.), 100 mM Mes (pH 6.5), 10 mM MnCl₂ and 10 μl of the resuspended beads. The mixtures were incubated at 37 °C overnight. Products of the polymerization reactions were isolated by gel filtration on a Superdex™ 75 column with 0.25 M NH₄HCO₃/0.7 % propan-1-ol as the eluent.

Quantitative real-time RT-PCR

Total RNA was extracted from L and sog9 cells using TRIzol® reagent. The cDNA was synthesized from ~1 μg of total RNA using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase and a random primer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR was performed using a FastStart DNA Master plus SYBR Green I (Roche) in a LightCycler ST 300 (Roche). Specific primers for mouse chondroitin glycosyltransferase and sulfotransferase genes were designed using the LightCycler Probe Design Software version 3.3 (Roche). The expression level of the chondroitin glycosyltransferase or sulfotransferase mRNAs was normalized to that of the GAPDH transcripts. The primers used for quantitative real-time RT-PCR are shown in Supplementary Table S1.
