# Membrane proteins with immunoglobulin-like domains—a master superfamily of interaction molecules

containing several characteristic but not invariant residues. When more proteins were sequenced and shown to be Ig-related such as Thy-1 they often looked like V-domains and were termed V-set although this did not imply sequence variability but just similarity to the overall V-set sequences (Fig. 2). Later many IgSF domains were found with sequence patterns more similar to V-domains but more the size of C-domains.

or more C2-set domains, e.g. CD66, and the highly abundant group of proteins with two IgSF domains that includes the CD2 family, CD200, CD80, CD86. This arrangement is also found in the NITR family of proteins found in puffer fish that appear to be inhibitory receptors [9]. Occasionally V-set domains are found amongst C2-set domains

hence optimising access to the binding site by receptors on opposing cells [27]. Carbohydrate sidechains can have particular roles such as in loading MHC antigens where a highly conserved carbohydrate site interacts with calnexin and interactions with such carbohydrate-binding chaperones may be important in protein folding [28]. However, many extracellular regions of surface proteins can be expressed in a folded manner without any carbohydrate
