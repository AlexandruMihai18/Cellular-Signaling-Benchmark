### Abstract

Vav proteins are evolutionarily conserved from nematodes to mammals and play a pivotal role in many aspects of cellular signaling, coupling cell surface receptors to various effectors functions. In mammals, there are three family members; Vav1 is specifically expressed in the hematopoietic system, whereas Vav2 and Vav3 are more ubiquitously expressed. Vav proteins contain multiple domains that enable their function in various fashions. The participation of the Vav proteins in several processes that require cytoskeletal reorganization, such as the formation of the immunological synapse (IS), phagocytosis, platelet aggregation, spreading, and transformation will be discussed in this review. We will also cover how the Vav proteins succeed in controlling these processes by their function as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for the Rho/Rac family of GTPases. The contribution of the Vav proteins in a GEF-independent manner to the organization of the cytoskeleton will also be deliberated. The scope of this review is to highlight the numerous roles of the Vav signal transducer proteins in actin organization.

### 1. Introduction

Active reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is an integral part of the cellular response to a variety of environmental signals. Appropriate remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton is critical for processes such as cell division, growth, adhesion, and locomotion. Though the term “skeleton” sounds static, the actin cytoskeleton is in fact a highly flexible structure that undergoes both transient and permanent changes in the course of normal development and in response to extracellular triggers.

Rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton is highly influenced by the activity of Rho family GTPases [reviewed in Refs. 1,2]. Rho GTPases are molecular switches that cycle between two conformational states: a GTP-bound “active” state and a GDP-bound “inactive” state. The transition between these two conformations is tightly regulated by three classes of proteins: GTPase activating proteins (GAPs) stimulate the intrinsic GTPase activity, thereby pushing the switch towards the inactive state; guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitors (GDIs) keep the GTPase in the GDP-bound inactive conformation; and guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) facilitate the exchange of GDP for GTP, thus activating RhoGTPases [reviewed in Refs. 1–3].

One well-studied family of GEFs for Rho GTPases is the Vav family of proteins. Vav1, the first member isolated, is a hematopoietic cell-specific signal transducer protein [4,5]. The other mammalian proteins in this family, Vav2 and Vav3, are more widely expressed [4]. Vav proteins are evolutionary preserved; thus, we recently isolated a *Drosophila* homologue of the Vav protein, DroVav [6]. All Vav proteins contain several characteristic structural motifs that enable their function as signal transducer proteins (Fig. 1). These include a *dbl* homology (DH) region, which exhibits a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity towards the Rho family GTPases; a pleckstrin homology (PH) domain which interacts with polyphosphoinositides; a Src Homology 2 (SH2) and two Src-Homology 3 (SH3) domains that mediate protein–protein interactions; a proline-rich motif that enables binding to SH3-containing proteins, an acidic-rich (Ac) region and a ‘calponin-homology’ (CH) region, which functions as an actin-binding domain in other proteins. An additional important characteristic is the close correlation between their activity as

Like other regulators of the Rho GTPases, Vav proteins mediate several cytoskeletal-associated cellular processes, as demonstrated in a variety of biological systems. Ectopic expression of activated forms of different Vav proteins in murine fibroblasts elicits morphological changes indicative of F-actin rearrangements, e.g. membrane ruffling and the extension of actin-rich surface protrusions called lamellipodia [9,11–13]. Expression of an activated mutant of the fly DroVav protein in S2 *Drosophila* cells results in similar changes (our unpublished results). These morphological changes are reminiscent of those induced by expression of constitutively activated mutants of Rac, whereas activated Rho induces the assembly of stress fibers and activated Cdc42 induces finger-like membrane extensions (filopodia) [14,15]. However, it is difficult to speculate through the morphological phenotype what are the GTPase targets activated by a specific GEF. Indeed, though controversies in the literature exist, it appears that mammalian Vav proteins can act specifically on both Rho- and Rac-like proteins but not on the highly related Cdc42 protein [8,9,13,16].

This review will discuss the role of Vav proteins in regulating reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton during several different biological processes. More specifically, the primary focus is the association between Vav1-controlled cytoskeletal rearrangements and the physiological outcome in hematopoietic cell lineages.

## 2. Vav and the immunological synapse

### 2.1. What is an immunological synapse?

The recognition of antigenic peptides bound to MHC molecules by the TCR/CD3 complex is the primary signal for T-cell activation. However, T-cell activation requires sustained interaction between the TCR and the MHC–peptide complex carried by the APC. Consequently, full activation requires costimulatory signals from accessory receptors such as CD2 and CD28. Triggering the TCR/CD3 complex without these costimulatory signals leads to anergy or apoptosis [17].

The initial adhesion between the circulating T cell and the APC is mediated by integrin interactions such as that between LFA-1 [18] and its ligand ICAM-1, and non-integrin interactions such as CD2–CD58. This step is followed by the formation of a tight interface between the T cell and the APC, referred to as the immunological synapse (IS). The IS, also called the supramolecular activation cluster (SMAC), is comprised of a remarkably organized complex of receptors, signaling molecules, and actin cytoskeletal components; this structure is proposed to account for the longevity and specificity of signaling [reviewed in Refs. 19–21].

High resolution immunofluorescence imaging of T-cell–APC conjugates revealed two discrete zones within the IS [22]. The central zone, the c-SMAC, contains the TCR and surface accessory molecules such as CD2 [23,24], CD4 [22], and CD28 [21,24]. The peripheral zone, the p-SMAC is enriched with the integrin LFA-1 and the cytoskeletal protein, talin [22]. Real time detailed imaging of the IS revealed that its formation is a dynamic process, beginning with the localization of LFA-1 molecules in the center of the T-cell/APC contact area while TCRs are concentrated at the periphery, a phase termed the immature immunological synapse. This pattern is then reversed, with TCRs recruited to the center of the c-SMAC, surrounded by an external ring of LFA-1, forming the mature IS. Once formed, the mature IS is stable for hours [25,26]. Although it is clear that sustained T-cell–APC contact is required for full T-cell activation and commitment [27], the function of the mature IS in T-cell activation remains enigmatic.

The actin cytoskeleton is a key component for the organization of the IS and subsequent proper T-cell activity [19,20,28]. The cytoskeleton is involved both in the molecular movements on the surface of the T cell required for formation of the IS and in the scaffolding of the signaling complexes which promote early receptor-mediated signaling. Therefore, signal transducer proteins that are involved in the control of actin organization, such as Vav1, are expected to participate in such events. Vav1 is a pivotal integrator of the complex relationship between IS formation, T-cell signaling and the actin cytoskeleton.

### 2.2. Vav1 participates in cytoskeletal reorganization, lipid raft clustering, and is formation in T cells

The first evidence to support a role for Vav1 in the regulation of TCR-mediated cytoskeletal reorganization emerged even before the concept of the IS had evolved. Vav1 was found to be necessary for the regulation of cytoskeletal organization in lymphocytes following TCR engagement, as manifested by diminished actin cap formation and TCR clustering in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ T cells [29,30]. Moreover, consistent with a role for Vav1 in linking TCR signals to the cytoskeleton, the observed TCR-triggered interactions of actin with CD3ζ was abolished in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ T cells [30]. Remarkably, despite the lack of cap formation and the impairment of other TCR-mediated processes such as proliferation, IL-2 production, and thymocyte maturation, other principle TCR-mediated signaling pathways including MAPK and SAPK/JNK activation were functional in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ T cells [30]. Taken together, these experiments established the significance of Vav1 as an activator of cytoskeleton organization.

Vav1 was also found to play a role in the clustering of lipid rafts. Lipid rafts are specialized microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, which are thought to serve as platforms for the assembly of signaling complexes [31]. The composition (surface receptors and signaling components) of the immunological synapse is indistinguishable from that of lipid rafts purified from activated T cells [32], suggesting that TCR engagement
might promote redistribution and clustering of lipid rafts at the immunological synapse. Indeed, confocal microscopy revealed that peptide stimulation of wild-type T cells induces clustering of lipid rafts and their colocalization at the T-cell–APC contact area [33,34]. T-cell activation-induced polarization of lipid rafts appears to be dependent on an intact actin cytoskeleton since pretreating T cells with F-actin-disrupting drugs abrogates lipid raft clustering [33,35]. Vav1 may be an essential part of the molecular link connecting T-cell activation to the actin cytoskeleton, and the lipid raft clustering. In Vav1-deficient T cells, lipid rafts fail to cluster following peptide stimulation [33]. In Jurkat T cells expressing a dominant negative mutant Vav1 lacking the PH domain, lipid rafts do not localize to the APC/TCR contact zone, and instead they undergo internalization. Expression of a dominant negative form of Vav1 mutated in the Dbl catalytic domain (L213A) did induce lipid raft aggregation at the membrane; however, this aggregation did not occur at the IS, but rather at the opposite side of the T cell [33]. These results provide direct and indirect evidence supporting a role for Vav1 as an integrator linking the cytoskeleton to lipid raft polarization induced by T-cell activation. However, using a Vav1-deficient Jurkat cell line, Cao et al. [36] found no detectable defect in lipid raft clustering following induction with the raft-clustering agent Cholera toxin B (CTx-B). These contradictory results probably stem from differences in the experimental systems used. There may be significant phenotypic variance between the Vav1-null Jurkat T-cell line [36] and T cells derived from Vav1⁻/⁻ mice [33]. Jurkat T-cell lines frequently acquire additional molecular alterations such as PTEN deficiency [37] which may result in different responses to stimulation.

The role of Vav1 in the formation of the IS has been studied using T cells from Vav1⁻/⁻ mice. According to Wulfing et al. [38], Vav1⁻/⁻ and Vav1⁺/⁻ T cells exhibit defective TCR/MHCII accumulation at the center of the T-cell/APC interface, the c-SMAC, indicating that Vav1 is an essential regulator of cytoskeletal rearrangement leading to IS formation. However, recent work by Ardouin et al. [39] claims that the accumulation of the TCR in the IS in Vav1⁻/⁻ T cells is comparable to that observed in wild-type T cells. Again, differences in methodology may explain these contrasts. First, the knockout mice used in these studies were different with regard to genetic background and to the transgenic TCR they express. Second, whereas Ardouin et al. [39] studied naive CD8+ class I restricted T cells, Wulfing et al. [38] used activated CD4+ class II restricted T cells. Third, whereas Ardouin et al. simply observed the presence or absence of TCRs in the IS, Wulfing et al. analyzed the density and patterning of TCRs. Other evidence supports a role of Vav1 in the formation or function of the IS. For instance, Vav1 accumulates transiently at the periphery and to a lesser extent in the center of the IS (Fig. 2) [40]. Moreover, the localization of PKCθ to the synapse is promoted by Vav1 activity [41,42]. PKCθ, a serine–threonine kinase, translocates to the cSMAC during IS stabilization concordant

with an increase in its catalytic activity [22]. The recruitment of PKCθ appears to be a marker for attainment of the stable IS, and may define the signaling threshold necessary to form a stable IS and a fully active T cell. Besides playing a role in the localization of PKCθ to the IS, Vav1 also induces the activity of PKCθ in a CD3/CD28 costimulation pathway that is dependent on Rac and actin cytoskeleton integrity [41,42]. Thus, through its interaction with PKCθ, Vav1 may play an additional role in TCR signaling, i.e. the maintenance of the signal in the mature IS.

### 2.3. Vav1, signaling, and the immunological synapse

As discussed above, Vav1 appears to be an important regulator of the IS formation. What are the molecular mechanisms underlying its ability to modulate the actin cytoskeleton and promote the clustering of TCRs at the APC/T-cell contact zone (Fig. 3)? The Vav proteins are the only known Rho GEFs that have an SH2 domain and conserved tyrosine residues, suggesting that their GEF activity is regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. In response to TCR ligation, Vav1 undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation [43,44], a response which is intensified by CD28 costimulation [45,46]. The identity of the kinase(s) that directly phosphorylate Vav1 upon TCR activation is controversial. Biochemical analysis of TCR signal transduction processes has shown that receptor stimulation leads to the rapid activation of Src-family tyrosine kinases such as Lck and Fyn. This leads to the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine activation motifs (ITAMs) on the TCR [47]. The phosphorylated tyrosines in these ITAMs associate with the SH2 domains of the tyrosine kinase Zap-70 [48]. Zap-70 is then activated by other Src family kinases leading to the phosphorylation and activation of other signaling molecules, among them presumably Vav1. A physical interaction between the SH2 domain of Vav1 and a phospho-tyrosine residue in the Zap-70 molecule is mandatory for Vav1 activation [49–51].

Valensin et al. [35] suggest a more complex scenario underlying the activation of Vav1 following TCR activation. They describe two “waves” of Vav1 phosphorylation; the first wave initiated by Fyn and the second carried out by Zap-70. In the first wave of Vav1 phosphorylation by Fyn, Zap-70 is not yet activated, and it seems that this phase is lipid raft-independent; i.e. is unimpaired when lipid rafts are chemically disaggregated. This first wave of Vav1 phosphorylation lasts for about 5 min, and is thought to promote lipid raft clustering at the IS. A second wave of Vav1 phosphorylation is then observed at 15 min, after raft coalescence occurs. At this stage Vav1 is recruited to the signaling complex by Slp-76 and Zap-70, an event that is probably mediated by the combined activity of Fyn and Zap-70. This second wave of Vav1 phosphorylation and its subsequent activation potentially leads to further reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, including formation and stabilization of the cap structure, a process dependent on Vav1 [35].
This model of Vav1 activation is in agreement with recent observations describing the link between TCR early signaling events and IS formation. It was recently demonstrated that TCR-mediated tyrosine kinase signaling occurs before mature IS has formed [26]. The use of antibodies against phosphorylated active forms of TCR signaling-related kinases such as Lck and Zap-70 identified these proteins at the periphery of the immature IS only at early time points (2 to 15 min) following stimulation. These results challenge the idea that the IS is required for T-cell receptor clustering, allowing sustained signaling in T cells for many hours. Interestingly, when we examined the localization of Vav1 following T-cell activation, we found that it behaves in a similar fashion: it accumulates in the periphery of the T-cell/APC interface by 5 min, is maximal there at 15 min, and is undetectable in the IS at 30 min (Fig. 2) [40]. We used Abs that do not distinguish between the activated and non-activated forms of Vav1. However, as Vav1 localization to the membrane is correlated with its activation, we assume that the majority of the Vav1 molecules detected in the IS are activated. Vav1 could therefore be involved in the generation, or the amplification of cytoskeletal rearrangements that occur in the peripheral area of the IS (Fig. 2). These results suggest that Vav1 takes part in tyrosine phosphorylation-mediated events that occur immediately following TCR ligation and lead to the formation of the IS. One implication of this is that even the earliest TCR signaling events may trigger pathways leading to cytoskeletal rearrangements. It is possible that the second wave of Vav1 phosphorylation and activation links Vav1 to additional signaling cascades, such as those involved in the release of calcium and NF-AT stimulation.

The catalytic function of Vav1 as a GEF towards Rho family GTPases is the key for transferring the signal from the activated TCR to the cytoskeleton. Vav1 is a preferential exchange factor for Rac1 in vitro [8,52] and in vivo [53]. A dominant negative Vav1 mutant defective in its catalytic DH domain (L213A) inhibits antigen-induced lipid raft aggregation at the IS [33]. A dominant negative Rac1 mutant caused similar effects, suggesting that raft polarization mediated by Vav1 proceeds through the enzymatic activation of Rac. These effects seem to be independent of Pak1, a well-characterized target of Rac1 [54], since dominant negative Pak1 did not inhibit raft polarization [33]. Rac might control cytoskeletal alterations by activating phosphatidylinositol-4 phosphate 5-kinase (PIP5K), which phosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 4 phosphate (PIP), producing phosphatidylinositol 4,5-biphosphate (PIP2) [55]. PIP2 is a substrate of PLCγ and an activator of talin and vinculin, proteins that then attach the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane.

Vav1 might function as a GEF towards additional Rho GTPases which could be critical for the formation of the IS. For instance, RhoG was recently shown to be activated by an oncogenic version of Vav1 in Jurkat T cells, in agreement with in vitro data showing that Vav1 acts as a GEF for RhoG [56]. In this experimental system, RhoG

A scheme of the cardinal regulatory pathways in which Vav is involved as an organizer of the cytoskeleton is depicted. Dashed arrows indicate pathways that are not fully recognized. A detailed explanation for each pathway is included in the text.

was shown to promote actin polymerization in T cells, though the effectors mediating this function of RhoG were not identified.

Another potential target for the GEF activity of Vav proteins is Cdc42. This member of the small GTPase family functions as an activator of the WASP protein, a key mediator of actin polymerization in T cells [57]. WASP binds the actin related protein complex Arp2/3, and upon activation, stimulates Arp2/3 to nucleate actin polymerization. In resting T cells, WASP maintains its inactive state by autoinhibition through binding of its c-terminal domain to its N-terminal GTPase binding domain. This conformation masks the binding site for Arp2/3. Activated Cdc42 associates with the WASP GTPase binding domain, releasing the autoinhibition and enabling activated WASP to bind Arp2/3. Mice lacking WASP exhibit normal signaling following TCR stimulation but cytoskeletal reorganization is severely
impaired [58]. This phenotype is strikingly similar to the T-cell defects observed in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ mice. Hence, Vav1 could induce actin cytoskeleton reorganization leading to TCR capping via Cdc42 and WASP. Indeed, the activation of Cdc42 is impaired in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ T cells [59]. In addition, Cdc42 is necessary for the polarization of microtubule cytoskeleton towards the APC upon antigen recognition [60]. Interestingly, the polarization of the microtubule cytoskeleton is inhibited in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ thymocytes encountering peptide antigen-pulsed APCs [39]. This suggests an additional role for Vav1 in the formation of the IS that could be mediated by Cdc42. However, the ability of Vav1 or other Vav1 family members to activate Cdc42 in vivo and in vitro is controversial [7–9,11,61,62]. Therefore, it is not clear whether Vav1 exerts its effects towards Cdc42 directly or through other, as yet undefined mechanisms.

As mentioned above, costimulation is required to achieve full activation of Vav1 in T cells [17]. Signals initiated by triggering the TCR/CD3 complex alone lead to Vav phosphorylation. Engagement of the co-receptor CD28 alone is also sufficient to induce Vav1 phosphorylation. Costimulation with both CD3 and CD28 leads to a higher proportion of phosphorylated Vav1 molecules, and prolongs phosphorylation [17]. Cbl-b participates in the suppressive mechanisms that do not allow full T-cell activation via TCR signaling alone [63,64]. Engagement of CD28 overrides this negative regulation. In the absence of Cbl-b, TCR signaling is enhanced, and receptor clustering occurs irrespective of CD28 signaling [63,64]. Using a genetic experimental system, Krawczyk et al. [59] have provided evidence for the existence of at least two Vav-1-regulated signaling pathways important for T-cell function. One controls calcium flux and NF-ATc transactivation following TCR ligation, and the other, enhanced by TCR and CD28 coligation, regulates cytoskeletal reorganization and receptor clustering via the Cdc42/WASP pathway. It appears that Cbl-b actively suppresses TCR/CD3-induced activation of the Vav1/WASP pathway for receptor clustering and proliferation. Importantly, whereas CD3/CD28-mediated induction of active, GTP bound, Cdc42 is significantly reduced in Vav1${}^{-/-}$ T cells, it is restored in Cbl-b${}^{-/-}$ Vav1${}^{-/-}$ T cells. These results show that, although Vav1 is a principal exchange factor for Rho family GTPases in T cells, another Rho family exchange factor can substitute for the loss of Vav1 and restore Cdc42 activation in a Cbl-b${}^{-/-}$ background. Since Vav2 hyperphosphorylation was observed in Cbl-b${}^{-/-}$ T cells, it is possible that Vav2 compensates for the loss of Vav1.

Vav1 may mediate actin cytoskeletal reorganization in T cells through other, GEF-independent mechanisms as well. Vav proteins harbor a single CH region, a sequence motif that has been identified in several actin-binding proteins. It has been suggested that Vav1 might bind actin directly through this domain. However, all known proteins that bind actin through this domain contain two CH domains, both required for actin binding [65]. It seems that the role of this CH domain

in the function of Vav1 is more complex than simply mediating its binding to actin, and is linked to regulatory mechanisms of its function as a GEF, as discussed below.

Talin and Vinculin, two proteins that anchor the actin cytoskeleton to the cell membrane bind constitutively to Vav1 in T cells [30]. Another cytoskeletal protein that associates with Vav1 is Zyxin [66]. As Vav1 contains a cluster of structural domains implicated in protein-protein interactions, among them the SH3-SH2-SH3 cassette, it may serve as an adapter that links cytoskeletal and signaling molecules to actin, thereby triggering actin polymerization (Fig. 3). More experimental work is needed to elaborate our knowledge of Vav1 GEF-independent mechanisms regulating cytoskeletal rearrangements.

3. Vav mediates phagocytosis through a GEF-dependent mechanism

Phagocytosis, a central component of the innate immune response, is the process whereby specialized cell types (mostly macrophages and neutrophils) recognize and engulf foreign extracellular material. This process involves the spatial and temporal reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton at sites of particle ingestion. One of the cell surface receptors mediating phagocytosis is the FcγR receptor. Notably, T-cell receptor and FcγR mediated signaling share similar downstream components. FcγR engagement causes the stimulation of protein tyrosine kinases that lead to the phosphorylation of ITAMs of these receptors [67,68]. ITAM phosphorylation induces recruitment of several cytoplasmic enzymes such as Syk [68]. Vav1 was shown to colocalize with actin at the phagosomal cup soon after its formation, accumulating along with the adapter molecules Nck and Slp-76 [69,70]. These findings suggest that Vav1 is involved in early events in phagocytosis and may link the FcγR signaling pathway to the actin cytoskeleton. Vav1 activity is indeed necessary for FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, since dominant negative forms of Vav reduced significantly the phagocytic potential of transfected macrophage cells [70]. Despite the phagocytic defect observed, the target binding capacity of macrophages was unaffected, implying that Vav1 is not required for clustering or recycling of the FcγR.

Phagocytosis through FcγR requires Cdc42 and Rac function [71]. The recruitment and function of these Rho GTPases specifically at the site of particle attachment is central to receptor-mediated phagocytosis. Artificial clustering of active Cdc42 beneath membrane-bound beads triggered actin polymerization and membrane protrusions around the particle [72]. Localized recruitment of active Rac also led to actin polymerization, and was sufficient to induce phagocytosis [73]. In vivo, progression of FcγR-directed phagocytosis correlated with a transient increase in active forms of endogenous Rac and Cdc42. [70]. Expression of dominant negative Vav1 completely abolished the FcγR-induced Rac activation, but did not harm the activation of Cdc42 [70].These results suggest that Vav1 functions as a Rac-specific GEF during FcγR-mediated phagocytosis and does not activate Cdc42 in this process. Recruitment of both Rac and Cdc42 to forming phagosomes was unaffected by dominant negative Vav1, and occurred before they were activated, i.e. in the GDP-bound form [70]. Taken together, this work demonstrates that Vav is involved in FcγR-mediated phagocytosis, mediating cytoskeletal rearrangements through its action as a GEF towards Rac but not towards Cdc42.

As discussed above, the catalytic activity of Vav is induced following its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues. Indeed, Vav was shown to be rapidly phosphorylated upon FcγR stimulation [74]. However, the mechanism for this FcγR-dependent activation of Vav is unresolved. The tyrosine kinase Syk is activated upon FcγR ligation, and subsequently triggers signaling events leading to engulfment [74,75]. Syk was shown to phosphorylate Vav1 in vitro [8]. Yet, FcγR activation promotes Vav1 phosphorylation in macrophages that lack Syk, suggesting that Syk is not the kinase responsible for Vav1 activation in macrophages [76]. Furthermore, ectopic expression of FcγR in COS cells that are devoid of Vav1 and Syk still promotes efficient tyrosine-kinase-dependent phagocytosis [77]. Hence, other Vav1 and Syk-independent mechanisms may substitute in non-hematopoietic cells for the activation of Rac. Interestingly, dominant negative Vav1 abrogated FcγR-mediated phagocytosis of COS cells that express ectopically the FcγR, but not Vav1 [70]. This result suggests that in COS cells Vav2 and/or Vav3 couple FcγR to Rac activation, as Vav1 does in hematopoietic cells. The high sequence homology between Vav1 and its two relatives makes trans-inhibition of their activity by a dominant negative Vav1 a reasonable possibility. Vav2 and/or Vav3 therefore probably subserve similar functions as Vav1 in non-hematopoietic cells.

### 4. Vav proteins and integrin signaling to the cytoskeleton

#### 4.1. Integrins and the cytoskeleton

The integrins are heterodimeric transmembrane receptors that link the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton thus mediating cell adhesion to the matrix and to other cells. Consequently, integrins cooperate with growth factor receptors to promote cell survival, cell cycle progression, and cell migration [reviewed in Refs. 78,79]. The integrins consist of an α and a β subunits. Each subunit has a large extracellular portion, a single transmembrane (TM) segment, and a short cytoplasmic domain. Ligand binding to the integrin extracellular domain induces a conformational change that is propagated to the cytoplasmic domain and initiates downstream signaling events; a process termed outside-in signaling. Conversely, intracellular signals can induce the integrin to bind to its matrix ligand through an inside-out signaling cascade.

The integrin β subunit cytoplasmic tail binds directly to two actin-binding proteins, talin and α-actinin [80–82]. In addition to forming links to the actin cytoskeleton, talin can increase the ligand binding affinity of integrins. Biochemical and mutational data indicate that interactions between integrin α and β cytoplasmic tails hold the resting integrin in a low-affinity conformation [83]. Talin disrupts αβ association of tail peptides, leading to activation of the heterodimer [84]. Integrin engagement, and the resulting interactions with the actin cytoskeleton, activates several signaling cascades that are important for maintaining strong cell-substrate or cell–cell adhesions and promoting cell spreading. The Vav family proteins are believed to play a central role in such signaling cascades in several biological processes (Fig. 3).

#### 4.2. Vav and T-cell spreading

T lymphocytes primarily circulate in the vascular system until they receive signals that trigger their enhanced adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) components, such as fibronectin, collagen, and laminin, or to vascular endothelium. The adherence of T cells to ECM components is a prerequisite for their migration into sites of inflammation [85]. Key regulators of these adhesion events are integrins. T cells plated on integrin ligands undergo cell polarization, which involves profound changes in the structure and shape of their cytoskeletons [86,87].

T cells plated on Fibronectin (FN), bind to FN through α5β1 and α4β1 integrins. Following plating, the T cells begin to spread, and show mainly filopodia and short lamellipodia. Concomitant with the appearance of these morphological changes, Vav1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine residues [88]. Overexpression of Vav1 in Jurkat T cells induces the formation of rapidly growing, very large lamellipodia, correlated with the increased activity of Rac and Cdc42. Conversely, dominant negative mutants of Vav1 (mutated in the DH or the PH domain) block integrin-induced T-cell spreading. Since a GEF-mutated Vav1 retained its capability to synergize with a constitutively active Rac and induce cell spreading [88], it is possible that GEF-independent mechanisms function in parallel to GEF-dependent mechanisms. However, the catalytic function of Vav1 as a GEF seems essential to integrin-mediated T-cell spreading on fibronectin.

#### 4.3. Vav1 controls integrin clustering at the immunological synapse

Integrins are critical for the formation of the immunological synapse following T-cell activation by an APC [reviewed in Refs. 89]. The initial adhesive contact that the T cell makes when it encounters an activated APC is integrin-mediated. It is believed that the integrin LFA-1 found on resting lymphocytes is kept on the surface by an actin-based cytoskeletal interaction that prevents it from cooperating with its neighboring molecules to form adhesive clusters. Upon activation of T cells by chemokines, the LFA-1 is freed from this interaction and can diffuse locally [90]. Its interaction with its ligand ICAM-1 induces a conforma-
functional change that initiates a signaling cascade, leading to new cytoskeletal interactions that reinforce adhesion. In this manner, LFA-1 is considered to costimulate T-cell activation by increasing the overall avidity of the interaction between an APC and a T cell, thus facilitating TCR triggering. TCR signaling activates integrins by inducing integrin clustering, which increases their avidity for their ligands. Integrin clustering is dependent on cytoskeletal reorganization [91].

The role played by Vav1 in the regulation of integrin activation and cell adhesion was examined by using Vav1⁻/⁻ T cells [92] and naive thymocytes [39]. In the absence of Vav1, thymocytes and peripheral T cells cannot adhere in an integrin-dependent manner to ECM proteins and cannot form peptide-specific conjugates with APCs. Integrin clustering, the result of inside-out signaling by the activated TCR, was also defective in Vav1⁻/⁻ T cells [92]. Hence, Vav1 links TCR signaling to cytoskeletal reorganization leading to integrin activation and adhesion of thymocytes and peripheral T cells. WASP, though important for TCR clustering, was found to be dispensable for integrin clustering and function [92]. These observations predict two separate cytoskeletal reorganization signaling pathways downstream of Vav1; one which regulates TCR capping via WASP and one which regulates integrin clustering via an unidentified signaling component.

The importance of Vav1 for outside-in signaling downstream of integrins following T-cell/APC interaction is controversial: Pyk2 phosphorylation, an event occurring downstream of integrin binding, is defective in Vav1⁻/⁻ T cells [92], implying that Vav1 may transduce signals downstream of LFA-1. However, treatment of thymocytes with Mg²⁺, which activates LFA-1 from the outside resulted in similar binding capacity in both Vav1⁻/⁻ and control thymocytes [39]. In summary, the severity of the defect in the Vav1⁻/⁻ cells might be attributed mainly to inefficient inside-out signaling of integrins but may be augmented by impaired outside-in signaling as well. Whether Vav1 regulates integrin function solely by inducing cytoskeletal reorganization and/or by an alternative function is unknown.

### 4.4. Platelet aggregation and spreading

The ability of plasma fibrinogen to bind the platelet-specific integrin αIIbβ3 following activation is a prerequisite for platelet aggregation and for other processes such as filopodial extension, spreading, and granule secretion [93,94]. These responses involve polymerization and rearrangements of actin filaments [95,96]. Adhesion of platelets to fibrinogen induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 [97,98] which is dependent on the kinase activity of the tyrosine kinase Syk [98,99]. Evidence for a functional role of Vav1 downstream of αIIbβ3 was provided by studies in A5 Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stably transfected with integrin αIIbβ3 [98,100]. Vav1 is strongly phosphorylated in the presence of Syk in the A5 CHO cells following adhesion to fibrinogen. Coexpression of Syk and Vav1 in the A5 cells is essential for Rac activation and formation of lamellapodia induced by fibrinogen [98,100]. Dominant negative Rac completely inhibits the increase in formation of lamellapodia, placing Rac downstream of Syk and Vav in this experimental system [100]. Moreover, platelets lacking Syk spread poorly on fibrinogen display fewer and less prominent lamellipodia, and exhibit no adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 [99]. Since inhibitors of Src in wild-type platelets inhibited adhesion-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of both Syk and Vav1, it appears likely that Syk is downstream of Src and upstream of Vav1 in an αIIbβ3 signaling pathway that regulates the platelet actin cytoskeleton [99].

Surprisingly, there is no discernable defect in the spreading of Vav1⁻/⁻ and Vav1⁻/⁻/Vav2⁻/⁻ platelets on fibrinogen [101]. This may reflect a redundant role for Vav3 in this system. Indeed, Vav3 has recently been shown to undergo Syk-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation following platelet adhesion to fibrinogen [99]. Experiments on mice deficient in Vav3 may answer this question.

### 4.5. Vav family proteins and integrins: a cooperation limited to the hematopoietic system?

The recent observation that Vav3 is tyrosine phosphorylated in platelets following integrin stimulation [99] raises the possibility that integrin signaling in nonhematopoietic cells involves Vav family members other than the hematopoietic cell-specific Vav1. However, thus far, there is little evidence to support this theory.

Plating Cos-7 cells on fibronectin, laminin or collagen does not induce phosphorylation of endogenous Vav2 even though FAK is phosphorylated, indicating that integrin receptors are efficiently activated [102]. Similarly, Liu and Burridge [11] could not detect integrin-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav2 in HEK293 or NIH3T3 cells. CHO cells expressing αIIbβ3 exhibit no phosphorylation of Vav2 or Vav3 in response to integrin activation unless Syk is coexpressed in these cells [102]. Syk expression was initially believed to be confined to hematopoietic cells. However, Syk is actually more widely distributed and may regulate anchorage-dependent growth of epithelial and endothelial cells [103–105]. Therefore, it is possible that Vav family members not yet analyzed participate with Syk in integrin signaling in non-hematopoietic cells.

The ability of Vav proteins to relay intracellular signals appears to be tightly correlated to their activation by tyrosine phosphorylation. However, according to Marignani and Carpenter [12], Vav proteins may participate in integrin signaling without an observed increase in their tyrosine phosphorylation following integrin stimulation. Their conclusion was based on a study in which expression of a dominant negative Vav2 mutant in NIH3T3 fibroblasts impaired their spreading on fibronectin, indicating that Vav2 is necessary for this process. When the cells were examined using live-time microscopy, cells expressing the mutant did form filopodia, but failed to form lamellipodia, implying that this mutant
blocks Vav2-mediated Rac activation by integrins. Src activity appears to be necessary for Vav2 activation of Rac and lamellipodia formation [12]. However, plating NIH3T3 cells on fibronectin did not increase Vav2 tyrosine phosphorylation in this or other studies. It is therefore speculated that the lack of increase in Vav2 phosphorylation is the result of concomitant dephosphorylation of inhibitory sites and phosphorylation of sites that stimulate exchange activity, with little net change in total tyrosine phosphorylation. This hypothesis requires further evaluation.

5. Transformation, Vav proteins and the cytoskeleton

Disruption of actin filaments and a decrease in focal adhesions are common features of cellular transformation by various oncogenes. These structural changes are highly related to both anchorage-independent growth and cellular tumorigenicity, suggesting fundamental roles for actin filaments in oncogenic transformation [reviewed in Refs. 106,107]. Small GTPases, primarily of the Rho family, are major determinants of cytoskeletal remodeling, thus their regulators and effectors are crucial for normal cellular responses, but are also targets for subversion during oncogenic transformation and tumor progression. In fact, Vav1 was originally isolated as an in vitro activated oncogene [108]. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the Vav1 oncogene revealed that it was activated in vitro by replacement of 67 residues of its amino-terminus with sequences of pSV2neo, co-transfected as a selectable marker [109]. Wild-type Vav1 produces minimal transformation of NIH3T3 murine fibroblasts only when the protein is grossly overexpressed [109,110]. By contrast, removal of its amino-terminus sequences (65 residues), mimicking the mode of activation of the first isolated Vav oncogene, is sufficient to induce Vav transformation. Recently, molecular lesions in the amino-terminus of Vav2 and Vav3 were shown to render these Vav family members transforming as well [9,13,111].

The mechanisms underlying transformation by Vav proteins have been subject to intensive research. Since Vav proteins function as GEFs and the morphology of the Vav-transformed cells is reminiscent of cells transformed by the dbl oncogene or active versions of Rho family GTPases [112], it seemed conceivable that Vav oncogene-induced transformation is the result of deregulated GEF activity. The most distinctive functional property of Vav family members is that their enzyme activities are triggered by tyrosine phosphorylation. Indeed, Vav proteins that have lost either the entire CH domain or the CH domain plus the Ac region show constitutive, phosphorylation-independent exchange activity, correlated with the highest transforming activity of all known Vav mutants [9]. These mutants prompted investigators to focus on the role of the CH and Ac regions as inhibitory domains regulating the enzymatic activity of Vav proteins.

Recently, NMR studies [16] showed that Tyrosine 174 within the acidic region of Vav1 makes several contacts with side chains of amino acids within the DH domain. After phosphorylation of Tyr174, the tyrosine is released from its binding pocket, which allows access of the DH domain to its substrate. All three mammalian Vav proteins as well as DroVav preserve this tyrosine within the acidic region, suggesting that this autoinhibitory mechanism is a common theme in the regulation of Vav proteins. However, It is possible that additional regulatory mechanisms exist. This is emphasized by the fact that the deletion of the 66 N-terminal residues is sufficient to induce the oncogenic activity of Vav1. In this “original” oncogenic form of Vav1, the inhibitory residue Y174, the entire acidic domain, and part of the CH domain are intact [8,9]. Theoretically, the absence of these 66 residues in the amino terminus may impair the formation of the autoinhibitory loop for steric reasons, thereby leaving the protein constitutively in an “open” active conformation. However, this model does not explain the fact that the exchange activity of this mutant remains phosphorylation dependent. Alternatively, the N-terminal tail could mediate protein–protein interactions that inhibit the biological activity of Vav in the resting state, and are relieved upon activation. We have recently described the binding of Ly-GDI, another potential regulator of Rho GTPases, to the amino terminus of Vav1 [113]. The significance of this interaction to the function of Vav1 in T cells has been demonstrated [40]. However, since Ly-GDI is not expressed in NIH3T3 cells, other proteins may also affect Vav transformation via association with the CH region.

The PH domain has also been shown to regulate the transforming potential of Vav proteins, though its role is more controversial. A possible function of the PH domain is to bind phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-generated lipid targets and thereby modulate targeting to the membrane where they are activated. Indeed, the PH domain of Vav interacts with two products of PI3K: PIP2 and PIP3 [114,115]. Whereas the binding of PIP3 moderately enhances the GEF activity of Vav1, binding to PIP2 has an inhibitory effect. Thus, a model was proposed where PIP2 association with the PH domain serves as a negative regulator of the catalytic activity, and the loss of PIP2 binding caused by PIP3 binding relieves this inhibition. Consistent with this model, Vav1 carrying a single mutation in its PH domain is constitutively active and induces cytoskeletal rearrangements indicative of Rac activation [116]. In contrast to these results, two recently published studies have demonstrated that mutation of the PH domain leads to loss of the transforming activity of both Vav1 and Vav2 [117,118] and is dispensable for Vav3 biological activity [13]. However, these recent observations regarding Vav1 and Vav2 were obtained using truncated, constitutively activate proteins and were not performed in the context of the full-length molecule. This may explain the contradictory results.

Collectively, these results suggest that Vav family proteins share the potential to induce cell transformation in vitro following molecular lesions that deregulate their catalytic activity. Cell transformation is not always associatedwith the ability of tumor cells to metastasize [120]. However, oncogenic Vav1-transformed NIH 3T3 cells do metastasize to the lungs of mice injected intravenously with the transformed cells [119], suggesting that Vav may contribute to the aggressiveness of transformed cells in vivo.

Recently, we demonstrated the expression of Vav1 in human neuroblastoma [121], a tumor of non-hematopoietic origin. Our results suggest that Vav1 plays a role in the neoplastic process in neuroblastomas. Thus, Vav1 can function in non-hematopoietic cells such as neuroblastoma, apparently by altering or augmenting normal intracellular signaling. Increased or altered signaling can lead to uncontrolled proliferation as demonstrated experimentally by the fact that wild-type Vav1 can transform NIH-3T3 fibroblasts when overexpressed [122, 123]. While these results are very suggestive of a role for Vav1 in tumorigenesis, further study is required to substantiate this hypothesis.

### 6. Concluding remarks

Vav1 has been intensively studied by a number of investigators since it was detected as an oncogene in 1989 [8]. Together with the more recent discoveries of other members of this family, Vav2 and Vav3, and the *Drosophila* homologue (DroVav), these studies have provided us with some insight into the hidden world of signaling and the intricate web of mechanisms leading to cell growth and differentiation. There is good evidence that the Vav proteins play a central role in triggering the cytoskeletal reorganization required for many physiological processes by participating in several distinct pathways as GEF proteins and as scaffold proteins. It is amazing that nature has handed so much responsibility to a single family of proteins, yet apparently their complex structure enables their multiple functions. Many questions remain regarding the mechanisms of Vav activity as a cytoskeletal regulator, a transforming protein and a protein that governs development.
