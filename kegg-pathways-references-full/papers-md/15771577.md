■ Abstract The proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes are regulated by receptors localized on the cell surface. Engagement of these receptors induces the activation of intracellular signaling proteins that transmit the receptor signals to distinct targets and control the cellular responses. The first signaling proteins to be discovered in higher organisms were the products of oncogenes. For example, the kinases Src and Abelson (Abl) were originally identified as oncogenes and were later characterized as important proteins for signal transduction in various cell types, including lymphocytes. Now, as many cellular signaling molecules have been discovered and ordered into certain pathways, we can better understand why particular signaling proteins are associated with tumorigenesis. In this review, we discuss recent progress in unraveling the molecular mechanisms of signaling pathways that control the proliferation and differentiation of early B cells. We point out the concepts of auto-inhibition and subcellular localization as crucial aspects in the regulation of B cell signaling.

INTRODUCTION

The development of B lymphocytes from hematopoietic stem cells can be divided into distinct stages on the basis of the sequential expression or loss of cell surface or intracellular proteins and of the rearrangement of the immunoglobulin (Ig) genes (1, 2). The progression from hematopoietic stem cells to mature B cells is regulated by specific signaling mechanisms in which Ig-related receptors play a crucial role (3). In pre-B cells, successful V(D)J rearrangement of the Ig heavy chain (HC) gene results in the expression of membrane-bound μHC protein. This μHC associates with the pre-existing surrogate light chain (SLC) consisting of λ5 and VpreB and the signaling components Ig-α/Ig-β to form the pre-B cell receptor (pre-BCR). A productive light chain (LC) gene rearrangement leads to the expression of the B cell antigen receptor (BCR), in which the LC replaces the SLC. Thus, the pre-BCR and the BCR serve as critical checkpoints that monitor successful Ig H and Ig L chain recombination, respectively. Therefore, these

receptors are the main center of B cell signaling, and they control the progression  
of B cells through development.  

Pre-BCR signaling is essential for the selection, proliferation, and differentiation  
of pre-B cells. Usually, the pre-BCR is only transiently expressed and therefore  
barely detectable on the surface of wild-type pre-B cells. Surface pre-BCR expression  
is associated with rapid pre-B cell expansion. Most likely, the pre-BCR role  
as a potent stimulator of pre-B cell proliferation is the reason for the stringent regulation  
of its expression. Interestingly, it is the pre-BCR itself that is responsible  
for this regulation. For instance, the SLC component λ5 induces the internalization  
of the pre-BCR and leads to the low-level expression of the pre-BCR on the cell  
surface (4). In addition, a negative feedback loop of pre-BCR signaling leads to  
the suppression of SLC expression. After a few cycles of cell division, the pre-B  
cells exhaust their supply of SLC and, therefore, cannot express a pre-BCR (5).  
To carry on B cell development, the downregulation of SLC expression must be  
accompanied by the induction of recombination at the loci of the conventional LC,  
which replaces the SLC and is expressed together with μHC in the context of the  
BCR. The downregulation of SLC expression and induction of LC recombination  
can be considered as pre-B cell differentiation markers. Although the importance  
of pre-BCR signals for proliferation and differentiation is clear, the underlying  
mechanisms and the molecules involved are still not fully characterized. It is also  
unclear whether distinct sets of signaling molecules are responsible for the different  
pre-BCR functions that control pre-B cell proliferation and differentiation.  

Activation of the pre-BCR/BCR signaling involves phosphorylation of the cytoplasmic  
immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs), which are present in the two Ig superfamily members Ig-α and Ig-β, as a first step in the formation of a lipid-raft-associated calcium-signaling module (6, 7). This complex contains three separate classes of activated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs), the Src family kinase Lyn, the Syk/ZAP70 kinase, and the Tec-family kinase Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase), as well as other proteins, including the adapter molecule SH2-containing leukocyte protein of 65 kDa (SLP-65, also known as BLNK or BASH), phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), Vav (a guanine nucleotide exchange factor for the Rho/Rac family of GTPases), and phospholipase C-γ2 (PLCγ2). Targeted disruption of structural components or downstream signaling proteins of the pre-BCR or BCR complex results in characteristic arrests in B cell development (Figure 1). Importantly, the expression and activity of proteins that are critically involved in signal transduction in B cells are strictly regulated. Syk is activated by binding to the phosphorylated ITAM tyrosines of Ig-α or Ig-β and most likely acts as a positive allosteric enzyme that can amplify BCR signals through the initiation of a positive feedback loop (8). The apparent redundancy among the Src family members Lyn, Fyn, and Blk has complicated the clarification of the role of the individual enzymes. Nevertheless, the ability of an activated Blk mutant to increase Ig-β and Syk phosphorylation demonstrated an important capacity of Src family kinases as well as their proximal point of action (9). By analogy with the BCR in mature B cells, it is assumed that activation of PLCγ2 by Syk and Btk results in the

production of the second messengers, inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and diacylglycerol (DAG), which activate calcium signaling, protein kinase C (PKC), and subsequently NF-$\kappa$B (6, 10–13). However, as this model was recently challenged by the description of a separate pre-BCR signaling route in which the activation of NF-$\kappa$B signaling is Syk-independent but involves Src family PTKs as well as PKC$\lambda$ (14), further experiments are required to characterize the pre-BCR signaling pathways in substantial detail.

## CONTROL OF B CELL SIGNALING

The phenomena of auto-inhibition and relocalization of signaling proteins to specific subcellular compartments play an important role in the initiation and regulation of signaling, which only recently has become more appreciated (15, 16). The characterization of these mechanisms helps to understand better the deregulation caused by oncogene products. Receptors as well as intracellular signaling proteins should only become active under the right circumstances and at the appropriate place within the cell. To ensure this, the activity and the subcellular localization of signaling proteins are controlled by several mechanisms. One common mechanism involves the intrinsic ability of a signaling molecule to return to a closed, inactive conformation. Such auto-inhibition may be mediated by a regulatory domain, which folds over and blocks the access to the catalytic or effector domain of a signaling protein. Signal transduction requires a shift in the equilibrium between a closed auto-inhibited conformation and an open signaling active conformation. This shift can be mediated either by protein modifications or by binding of a regulatory subunit to its target structures. Therefore, in most cases signals are generated only at certain places inside the cell. The equilibrium between auto-inhibition and

activation is also affected by negative regulatory elements like protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) that counteract the activation and allow signal amplification only if critical thresholds are reached.

### ABL

The PTK c-Abl and its oncogenic forms v-Abl and BCR-ABL (17) provide good examples of these regulatory principles. The crystal structure of the c-Abl protein shows a conformation in which the SH2 and SH3 domain folds over the catalytic domain of c-Abl, resulting in auto-inhibition of the kinase activity (18, 19). In the case of the c-Abl 1b form, binding of the N-terminal myristoyl modification to the kinase domain further stabilizes the closed and therefore inactive conformation. An N-terminal truncation and fusion with another protein moiety as shown by the oncogenic forms of Abl can prevent the auto-inhibitory conformation and lead to a constitutive activation of the Abl kinase. More importantly, the oncogenic modifications result in a relocalization of the active kinase to a place in the cell where the kinase is presumably protected from the action of negative regulatory PTPs. At these cellular sites, the oncogenic Abl forms can interact with other signaling partners (20). The myristoylated v-Abl is localized in specialized membrane domains such as rafts and the myristoylation anchor of v-Abl is required for the transformation of NIH/3T3 cells (21). The BCR-ABL oncogene product shows an N-terminal deletion interfering with the auto-inhibition of the normal c-Abl protein. In addition, the coiled-coil structure of the BCR part of BCR-ABL mediates tetramerization and presumably a specific relocalization of the deregulated kinase (20).

### The Syk Tyrosine Kinase

The importance of auto-inhibition and relocalization has also been recently recognized in signal transductions from the BCR. The engagement of the BCR results in a rapid activation of the Src family kinase Lyn and the cytosolic kinase Syk, both of which are regulated by auto-inhibition (22). In the case of Syk, the two N-terminal tandem SH2 domains inhibit the activity of the kinase domains (23). This auto-inhibition is only released if Syk meets its activation sequence, namely the ITAMs that are located in the cytosolic tails of the Ig-α/Ig-β heterodimer of the BCR (8, 24). The binding to phosphorylated Ig-α or Ig-β places the active Syk in the right position to allow further phosphorylation of neighboring ITAM sequences. This results in further Syk recruitment and activation, which then lead to the amplification of the BCR signal (25). However, the process of Syk recruitment and activation is under tight control of membrane-bound or cytosolic PTPs, which efficiently eliminate the phospho groups at the ITAMs and thus counteract Syk activation (26). Without additional regulation, PTPs prevent the positive amplification loop generated by Syk after binding to phosphorylated ITAMs (8). Therefore, another critical event in B cell activation, apart from the release of Syk from auto-inhibition, is the relocalization of the BCR/Syk complex to a place

inside the cells where PTPs are not active. For example, the colocalization of the BCR together with an active oxidase, producing superoxide anions and hydrogen peroxides, should result in the oxidation of a critical cysteine in the catalytic domain of BCR-proximal PTPs and their inactivation (27). Signal transduction from the BCR thus seems to require not only kinase activation but also PTP inhibition via the relocalization of the BCR to subcellular sites with high oxidase activity.

# The Lyn Tyrosine Kinase

The Src family kinase Lyn might support BCR activation by phosphorylating the first tyrosine of the ITAM sequence and other BCR proximal signaling elements and presumably by stimulating oxidase activity (8). Apart from its positive effect on BCR signaling, however, Lyn participates in a negative feedback loop that terminates BCR signaling. Upon activation, Lyn phosphorylates inhibitory receptors like CD22 and CD72, which are then bound by phosphatases that dephosphorylate the ITAMs and inhibit signal transduction (28). Indeed, B cells from Lyn-deficient mice do not show drastic developmental defects and are hyperreactive rather than hyporeactive (29, 30). Furthermore, Lyn-deficient mice show a high susceptibility to the development of autoimmune diseases, characterized by circulating auto-reactive antibodies and the deposition of IgG immune complexes in the kidney (31). These results demonstrate the importance of Lyn as an inhibitory element of BCR signaling, whereas Lyn's role as a positive signaling element of BCR signaling is only seen if Lyn deficiency is combined with deficiencies of other signaling elements, such as Btk (32).

In the chicken B cell line DT40, Lyn deficiency results in the reduction of both calcium mobilization and tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate proteins. In contrast, Syk deficiency results in a complete loss of calcium mobilization, indicating that Syk plays a dominant role in this context compared with Lyn (22, 33). Similarly, murine B cells deficient for Syk family kinases, namely Syk and ZAP70, show a severe block of early B cell development at the pre-B cell stage and a defective allelic exclusion (34). In addition to its role as a tyrosine kinase, Syk may also perform an adaptor protein function. For example, upon activation, Syk becomes phosphorylated at several tyrosines, which are situated in the linker region between the two SH2 domains or between the SH2 domain and the kinase domain (35, 36). These phosphorylated tyrosines may be required for the binding and recruitment of other signaling proteins that participate in signaling. For instance, phosphorylation of tyrosine 341 of Syk has been implicated as a binding site for SH2 domains of PLCγ2 and Vav (36, 37). The impacts of the adaptor protein function and tyrosine kinase activity of Syk on B cell proliferation and differentiation are currently unclear. Nonetheless, Syk is one of the dominant driving forces for the proliferation and expansion of the early pre-B cells, as murine B cells deficient of Syk kinase activity are blocked at the pro-B cell stage and do not enter the proliferation program of pre-B cells (34).

Pre-B Cell Proliferation

The activation of PI3K and the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathways by Syk may provide the essential mechanisms of Syk-induced proliferation (38). PI3K activation results in the activation of the adaptor protein BAM32 (39) and other effector signaling proteins, including PKB/AKT, which promotes cell proliferation and suppresses apoptosis (40). Indeed, Syk activation was shown to be necessary for PI3K activity in B cells (41). The important role of Syk in the proliferation program of pre-B cells implies that Syk has the potential of an oncogene. However, mutations or translocations affecting the Syk gene have rarely been found in leukemias (42). To prevent transformation by Syk, pre-B cells may have developed several negative regulatory feedback loops to control the proliferation signals provided by Syk. One of these loops clearly involves the adapter protein SLP-65, which leads to the downregulation of the pre-BCR and subsequent limitation of Syk activity (see below). However, Syk activity is also strongly controlled by phosphatases as described above. In addition, the expression level of Syk is strictly controlled by protein degradation. In this context, the proto-oncogene Cbl plays an important role (43, 44). Phosphorylation of Syk at tyrosine 317 provides a binding site for the phosphotyrosine binding (PTB) domain of Cbl (45–47). In addition to the adaptor protein function, Cbl contains a ring domain and functions as an ubiquitin ligase, which is part of a complex mediating the rapid ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of Syk (48). This Cbl-mediated degradation of Syk might be an important negative regulatory loop, which limits the amount and range of active Syk in the B cells. Although Syk itself is only rarely implicated in lymphocyte tumors, two Syk-associated proteins, Cbl and Vav, were first identified as proto-oncogenes, indicating that they are important in the regulation of the Syk-mediated proliferation signals (37, 49).

THE ADAPTOR PROTEIN SLP-65 IS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR

SLP-65 and Pre-B Cell Differentiation

Since its identification as a signaling component that is phosphorylated upon BCR engagement, SLP-65 has become the central element in pre-BCR/BCR signaling. SLP-65 is one of the most prominent targets of Syk kinase activity, which phosphorylates SLP-65 on several tyrosines following BCR stimulation. Phosphorylated SLP-65 provides docking sites for various signaling proteins, including Grb2, Vav, Nck, PLC-$\gamma$2, Btk, and the pre-BCR/BCR subunit Ig-$\alpha$, thereby coupling the pre-BCR/BCR with downstream signaling elements (50, 51). The central role of SLP-65 in B cell signaling was highlighted by the phenotype of the SLP-65-deficient mice (52–55), which is comparable to the X-linked immunodeficiency ($xid$) phenotype found in mice deficient for Btk (see below). These mice show strongly reduced overall numbers of mature B cells, absence of CD5$^+$ (B1)
B cells, reduced serum levels of IgM and IgG3, impaired responses to thymus-independent antigens, and a reduced capacity of B cells to proliferate in vitro in response to various stimuli (52). The consequences of SLP-65 deficiency are even more severe in humans, leading to agammaglobulinemia similar to XLA (X-linked agammaglobulinemia), which is caused by mutations in Btk (56).

Several lines of evidence suggest that the adaptor protein SLP-65 is a central element in transmitting the differentiation signals of the pre-BCR (Figure 2). For instance, pre-B cells deficient for SLP-65 show a remarkable increase of surface pre-BCR expression and an enhanced proliferation rate. The expression of the pre-BCR is required for the proliferation of SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells because SLP-65-deficient cells lacking components of the pre-BCR display a reduced proliferation rate. Reconstitution of SLP-65 expression results in downregulation of surface pre-BCR expression and enhanced pre-B cell differentiation (57, 58). These data suggest that although SLP-65 is required for the pre-BCR signals that lead to pre-BCR downregulation and pre-B cell differentiation, it is not required for signals inducing pre-B cell proliferation. The essential role of Syk compared with the dispensable role of SLP-65 in pre-B cell proliferation suggests that Syk transmits the pre-BCR signals that induce proliferation via a signaling cascade lacking or independent of SLP-65. In contrast, SLP-65 has a negative effect on pre-B cell proliferation because it causes the downregulation of both pre-BCR and IL-7R expression (57, 59).

It is feasible that activated Syk alone, in the absence of any downstream adapter proteins, is able to induce some PLCγ activation, although this apparently does not result in a full calcium response. However, suboptimal PLCγ activation may produce enough DAG to recruit the GDP/GTP exchange factor Ras-GRP to the membrane, resulting in Ras activation and signal transduction through the Ras/Raf/MEK/Erk pathway (Figure 2). Syk activation in SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells may stimulate the Erk pathway, which is essential for the high proliferation rate of these pre-B cells (57, 60). Although not yet directly shown by genetic or biochemical experiments, it is feasible that the adapter function of Syk is involved in the activation of the Erk pathway.

## SLP-65 and Pre-B Cell Leukemia

A main consequence of SLP-65 deficiency is the elevated pre-BCR expression on the cell surface, resulting in a permanent Syk activation and enhanced proliferation of SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells. A further dramatic consequence of SLP-65 deficiency is the development of pre-B cell leukemia. In roughly 6% of these mice at the age of 10 weeks, splenomegaly and occasionally solid tumors were found. The affected mice showed penetration of pre-B cells in all tissues (57). These data suggest that SLP-65 acts as a tumor suppressor that limits the proliferation of pre-B cells. Strong evidence for the tumor suppressor role of SLP-65 is provided by experiments showing that SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells cause leukemia when injected into immune-deficient mice, whereas reconstitution of SLP-65 expression

Figure 2 Distinct signaling pathways regulate the proliferation and differentiation of pre-B cells. The adaptor protein SLP-65, in association with Btk, is required for the differentiation signals that downregulate the SLC and induce the recombination of the LC gene locus. An alternative complex containing SLP-76 and LAT participates in the transduction of pre-BCR signals for pre-B cell differentiation. The proliferation of pre-B cells is induced by SLP-65-independent pre-BCR signals, which are supported by signaling from the IL-7 receptor (not depicted).
stimulated the differentiation of these cells and inhibited their potential to cause leukemia (61). Although these data point to a tumor suppressor role of SLP-65, they suggest that SLP-65 deficiency alone is not sufficient to cause leukemia development because the majority of the SLP-65-deficient mice do not develop leukemia. SLP-65 deficiency is rather the first event that requires secondary mutations for the transformation of pre-B cells and leukemia development. Likely targets of these secondary mutations are the signaling proteins involved in pre-B cell differentiation. SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells are only partially blocked in differentiation, which suggests that residual pre-BCR signals are still transmitted, enabling pre-B cell differentiation in the absence of SLP-65. This residual pre-BCR signaling depends on the adaptor proteins LAT (linker for activation of T cells) and SLP-76 (58) (Figure 2). LAT and SLP-76 are well-known adaptor proteins essential for signaling from the T cell receptor (TCR) (62). Mutations affecting the residual pre-BCR signaling and thus the residual differentiation capacity of SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells should increase the frequency of leukemia in SLP-65-deficient mice. Indeed, SLP-65/LAT-double-deficient (and SLP-65/Btk-double-deficient; see below) mice show a severe block of pre-B cell differentiation and an increased incidence of pre-B cell leukemia (58; H. Jumaa, unpublished results). Similarly, SLP-65/CD19-double-deficient mice also show a severe block in B cell differentiation and increased frequency of pre-B cell leukemia compared with SLP-65-deficient mice (63).

Further targets for secondary mutations that transform SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells may belong to the signaling pathway of the IL-7 receptor. SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells require IL-7 for survival and proliferation, although they can proliferate even at low IL-7 concentrations (57). Mutations affecting IL-7 receptor signaling may render SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells independent of IL-7 and result in transformation of these cells. However, it is still unclear which genes are affected by secondary mutations and what mechanisms are responsible for these mutations.

## Potential Role of the V(D)J Recombinase in Leukemia Formation

In this context, the finding of expression of the recombination-activating genes RAG-1 and RAG-2, which mediate V(D)J recombination, in strongly proliferating SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells led to the hypothesis that continuous V(D)J recombination activity may contribute to the accumulation of mutations, deletions, and/or chromosomal translocations, and finally result in the oncogenic transformation of pre-B cells (57, 63). Normally, RAG expression is transiently downregulated upon pre-BCR signaling to terminate further Ig H chain rearrangement, thus ensuring that only one functional Ig H chain is synthesized, a phenomenon referred to as allelic exclusion (64). RAG activity is coupled to the cell cycle (65, 66), because the V(D)J recombination process involves DNA cleavage and because the presence of DNA double strand breaks (DSB) during DNA replication or mitosis could interfere with faithful transmission of genetic information to daughter cells.
Moreover, incorrect repair of DNA may give rise to genomic instability, which can result in carcinogenesis through activation of proto-oncogenes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes (67, 68). The identification, in particular B and T cell lymphomas, of translocation breakpoints in which an Ig or TCR locus was fused with other regions of chromosomal DNA containing oncogene loci first pointed at the involvement of the V(D)J recombinase system in lymphomagenesis. In recent studies, the endonuclease activity of the RAG complex was found to be essential for chromosomal translocations and oncogenic gene amplification (69–72).

Several models have been proposed to explain how the V(D)J recombinase might be involved in such chromosomal rearrangements (reviewed in 73). One model involves erroneous recombination whereby V(D)J recombinase activity results in a DSB in an antigen receptor locus, which is subsequently joined to a DSB outside that locus, generated either by RAG-mediated cleavage at a DNA region that is not a consensus V(D)J recombination signal sequence or by an unrelated RAG-independent means. Another model is that RAG proteins capture exogenous target DNA and carry out transposition-mediated genome rearrangements. Such a transposition reaction could result in chromosomal translocations and may also result in DNA insertion. This transposition reaction was recently shown to occur in vivo when an excised signal-end fragment from the TCRα locus was found to be inserted into the X-linked hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyl transferase locus in human T cells (74).

## V(D)J Recombinase Activity in SLP-65-Deficient Pre-B Cells

Several lines of evidence indeed suggest that tumor formation is dependent on the ongoing RAG activity in SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells: (a) RAG expression is detected both in SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells and lymphoma cells (57, 63; R.W. Hendriks, unpublished results); (b) whereas L chain rearrangement is normally only initiated in cells that have terminated SLC expression, SLP-65-deficient pre-B cell lymphomas contain cells that coexpress Ig H chain, SLC, and IgκL chain (75); (c) defective SLP-65 expression is associated with secondary, mostly nonproductive, V<sub>H</sub> gene rearrangements in most BCR-ABL1 kinase-positive pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (pre-B ALL) (76); (d) we did not detect tumor formation in a limited group of Btk/SLP-65-double-deficient mice, which were crossed onto a RAG-1-deficient background, whereby pre-B cellularity was rescued with a pre-rearranged Ig H chain transgene (R.W. Hendriks, unpublished results). Although these results indicate that RAG activity is required for the malignant transformation of SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells, the reason for RAG expression in these cells is still unclear. In particular, it is unclear whether SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells are arrested at a stage where they express the RAG enzymes or whether SLP-65 function is required for the downregulation of RAG expression.

The finding that RAG expression is downregulated in SLP-65-deficient large cycling pre-B cells suggests that RAG downregulation is independent of SLP-65
(57). As RAG downregulation is required for allelic exclusion (64), this finding may explain the intact Ig H allelic exclusion in SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells (63). This might seem contradictory to previous findings that suggested a SLP-65 role in the downregulation of RAG expression (59, 63). However, Schebesta et al. (59) reconstituted Pax-5-deficient pro-B cells with SLP-65, and it may be argued that the regulation of RAG gene expression is different in the absence of this essential transcription factor. Hayashi et al. (63) have compared pre-B cell populations from wild-type mice, SLP-65-deficient mice, and SLP-65/CD19-double-deficient mice. They found increased expression of RAG-2 protein in the absence of SLP-65. These differences do not necessarily point to a role for SLP-65 in RAG downregulation because they might reflect the different cell cycle status or stage of differentiation in these mice. When we introduced SLP-65 expression into SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells and compared them with parental cells, we found the opposite result, as SLP-65 expression induced both RAG expression and germline $k$ transcription (H. Jumaa, unpublished results). Taken together, the available data suggest that SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells represent a stage in which SLP-65-independent signals have already ensured Ig H allelic exclusion. This stage is characterized by basal levels of RAG expression that seem to be high enough to induce tumor formation. At this stage of development, wild-type pre-B cells downregulate the pre-BCR and become resting cells. However, SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells keep cycling owing to enhanced expression of the pre-BCR and IL-7R (57, 59), both of which induce proliferation. The importance of pre-BCR expression is demonstrated by the fact that all leukemia cells in the SLP-65-deficient mice express the pre-BCR on the cell surface, suggesting a crucial role for the pre-BCR in leukemia development. In agreement with this view, SLP-65/$\lambda$5-double-deficient mice incapable of pre-BCR expression show no signs of leukemia development. Pre-B cells from these SLP-65/$\lambda$5-double-deficient mice express a surface pre-BCR form lacking an SLC or a conventional LC (77). This LC-deficient pre-BCR seems to be sufficient for inducing allelic exclusion, but insufficient for the stimulation of pre-B cell proliferation (77, 78).

### SLP-65 DEFICIENCY IN HUMAN PRE-B CELL ACUTE LYMPHOBLASTIC LEUKEMIA

In mice, SLP-65 deficiency results in a partial block in pre-B cell differentiation, whereas the proliferation capacity is enhanced owing to the increased pre-BCR expression on the cell surface. In contrast to the partial block in murine B cell development, SLP-65 deficiency in humans leads to a complete block of differentiation at the pre-B cell stage (56). A block in differentiation combined with the cell's ability to survive and proliferate is a likely model for the development of leukemia in humans. Because SLP-65 is required for the differentiation of both human and murine pre-B cells, a somatic SLP-65 deficiency in developing
human pre-B cells blocks their differentiation but may not affect their survival. Indeed, we found that about half of the analyzed cases of childhood pre-B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (pre-B ALL), the most common cancer disease in children, shows a drastic reduction of SLP-65 expression (61). The finding that the SLP-65 gene contains alternative exons (termed exon 3a and 3b) located in intron 3 provides one mechanism to explain the reduction in SLP-65 expression. If exon 3a or 3b are included in the SLP-65 mRNA, a premature stop codon is introduced, which interrupts the open reading frame of SLP-65 and prevents protein expression. Specific splicing factors are most likely required to exclude these alternative exons from the mature SLP-65 mRNA and to allow SLP-65 protein synthesis. Alteration of this splicing program may result in SLP-65 deficiency. Currently, neither the splicing factors required for proper SLP-65 RNA splicing nor the reasons that lead to the deregulation of the splicing machinery are known. Because some viruses can reorganize the splicing machinery, a viral infection may lead to the inclusion of SLP-65 alternative exons, which reduces the ratio of normal transcripts. Consequently, the amount of SLP-65 protein is reduced and pre-B cell differentiation is hindered. In this scenario, not only a complete loss but also a reduction in the amount of SLP-65 protein may be sufficient to impede pre-B cell differentiation. Additional mutations, possibly due to continued RAG expression, would then result in cell transformation and pre-B cell leukemia. The heterogeneity in morphology and cytogenetics of the pre-B ALL lymphoblasts may result from the heterogeneity of secondary mutations that transform the cells. In this view, the postulated differentiation block, which represents the initial step in leukemia development (79), is due to a defect in SLP-65 function. This defect may affect SLP-65 expression or one of its essential interaction partners. Indeed, defective expression of two of these essential partners, Syk and Btk, was reported in the leukemic cells of childhood ALL patients (79, 80). In both cases, aberrant transcripts lacking parts of the coding sequence were found in the leukemic cells.

Two lines of evidence suggest that the inclusion of the alternative exons is the primary cause of SLP-65 deficiency in human pre-B ALL, although additional scenarios are not excluded. First, the oncogene BCR-ABL blocks pre-B cell differentiation by downregulating the expression of proteins involved in pre-BCR signaling such as SLP-65 (76). The downregulation of SLP-65 expression takes place at the level of splicing as high levels of SLP-65 transcripts containing the alternative exon 3b were detected in BCR-ABL-positive cells (76). Incubation of these cells with the BCR-ABL inhibitor STI571 increased the ratio of normal SLP-65 transcripts and induced differentiation from pre-B to the immature B cell stage (76). Similarly, leukemic cells of BCR-ABL-positive pre-B ALL patients express high levels of the exon 3b containing SLP-65 transcripts. Again, STI571 treatment increased the ratio of normal SLP-65 transcripts and induced differentiation (76). The second line of evidence for the notion that alternative splicing (e.g., recognition of exon 3b) is the primary cause for defective SLP-65 expression in pre-B ALL is the finding that a single nucleotide alteration that increases the recognition
of exon 3b is more frequently found in the SLP-65 gene of pre-B ALL patients than in the normal population (H. Jumaa, unpublished results). This would be the first human polymorphism, which is correlated with the development of pre-B cell leukemia.

Exon 3b seems to be the most important alternative exon for the splicing machinery in the human SLP-65 gene. In addition to the premature stop codon, the inclusion of exon 3b introduces a downstream in-frame ATG. If included, the downstream ATG in exon 3b might generate a SLP-65 isoform lacking the N-terminus, whereas the normal ATG would, in this case, lead to the production of a protein consisting only of the SLP-65 N-terminus. Such aberrant proteins might interfere with SLP-65 function in a dominant negative fashion because they might sequester SLP-65 interaction partners and inhibit the transmission of differentiation signals from the pre-BCR. Notably, the N-terminus of SLP-65 is highly conserved and contains crucial interaction sites for SLP-65 function because deletion of this region abolishes SLP-65 activity in pre-B cell differentiation (57).

An interesting difference between the murine and human SLP-65-deficient leukemia is the correlation between pre-BCR expression and SLP-65 deficiency. As mentioned above, the increased proliferation capacity of SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells in the mouse is correlated with pre-BCR expression, whereas no such correlation was observed in human pre-B ALL cases (61). A possible explanation for this difference is that pre-BCR expression is required at the initial time of leukemia, whereas an established pre-B ALL tumor no longer needs pre-BCR expression for proliferation. The ongoing RAG activity in SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells may not only result in secondary mutations, but may also lead to secondary V<sub>H</sub> rearrangements at the HC gene locus. Such secondary rearrangements occur by replacement of an already rearranged V<sub>H</sub> gene segment by another (in most cases upstream) V<sub>H</sub> gene segment (81). The phenomenon of V<sub>H</sub> gene replacement is well known in murine Abelson murine leukemia virus-transformed pre-B cell lines that frequently gain or lose HC expression owing to secondary V(D)J rearrangements (82). In agreement with this, the frequency of V<sub>H</sub> gene replacement by secondary rearrangement in BCR-ABL-positive pre-B ALL is 75%, which is surprisingly high compared with 5% (frequency of V<sub>H</sub> gene replacement) in normal human B cells (76).

Although the link between SLP-65 deficiency and leukemia development seems to be established in mice (57, 63), experiments mainly using microarrays for gene expression profiling suggest normal expression of SLP-65 in human pre-B ALL (83). One drawback of this method, however, is that aberrant transcripts and alternatively spliced forms are recognized as normal transcripts, although they are unable to generate a functional protein. Notably, only full-length SLP-65 can fulfill its function in pre-B cell differentiation. To check for full-length SLP-65 expression and confirm the correlation between SLP-65 deficiency and childhood pre-B ALL, we analyzed >100 pre-B ALL samples by western blot. These experiments confirmed the high frequency of deficient SLP-65 protein expression in pre-B ALL cases (H. Jumaa, unpublished results).
BRUTON'S TYROSINE KINASE

X-Linked Agammaglobulinemia and X-Linked Immunodeficiency

Btk (Bruton's tyrosine kinase) is a nonreceptor PTK that was originally identified as the gene defective in the human immunodeficiency disease XLA (84, 85). Btk is a 659 amino acid protein that belongs to the Tec kinase family, which also includes Tec, Itk, Bmx/Etk, and Rlk (86). These tyrosine kinases are structurally similar to Src family kinases in that they consist of an SH3, an SH2, and a catalytic domain. However, they also have a Tec homology (TH) domain, just upstream of the SH3 domain. The TH domain contains a proline-rich sequence implicated in intramolecular interaction with SH3 domains, thereby mediating auto-inhibition by preventing the interaction of these domains with their ligands. Like most Tec kinases (with the exception of Rlk), Btk also has an N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is able to bind phosphatidylinositols, which is essential for the recruitment of Btk to the plasma membrane upon PI3K activation.

Btk is expressed throughout B cell differentiation, but at the transition from mature B cells to plasma cells expression is downregulated (87–89). Although Btk is also present in myeloid and erythroid cells, these cell lineages do not appear to be affected in XLA or *xid*. Btk is not detected in the T cell lineage. In addition to its function in pre-BCR signaling, Btk has been implicated as a mediator of signals from various other receptors, including FcεR, IL-5R, IL-6R, IL-10R, collagen receptor, erythropoietin receptor, and Toll-like receptor 4 (90–96).

XLA, which was first described by Bruton in 1952 (97), is characterized by protracted and recurrent bacterial infections (reviewed in 98). Patients have less than 1% of the normal number of peripheral B cells, and the B cells that are present have an immature IgM<sup>high</sup> phenotype and show an increased κ to λ ratio (99). Serum levels of all Ig classes are very low owing to the lack of plasma cells in the secondary lymphoid organs. When stimulated with anti-CD40 and IL-4, XLA B cells proliferate normally, show CD23 expression, and differentiate into specific Ab-producing cells (100). Heterozygous female XLA carriers do not have clinical or immunological symptoms, but they do manifest a unilateral X chromosome inactivation in the peripheral blood B lymphocyte population because of a selective disadvantage in proliferation, differentiation, and survival of cells that have the defective Btk gene on the active X chromosome (101, 102).

The exact location of the developmental arrest in XLA has been controversial for some time because the numbers of cytoplasmic μHC-expressing pre-B cells in XLA bone marrow are variable (103–105). Nevertheless, by more detailed flow cytometric studies, using antibodies specific for human V<sub>preB</sub>, Nomura et al. (106) showed that in XLA patients the cμ<sup>+</sup>SLC<sup>+</sup> pre-B cell fraction mainly consists of small cells, suggesting that Btk is necessary for the proliferative expansion and the survival of cμ<sup>+</sup> pre-B cells. Because most patients have substantial numbers of pro-B cells in their bone marrow, XLA generally results in an increased ratio of

pro-B to pre-B cells. XLA is a heterogeneous disease, even within single families. An international registry for XLA (http://bioinf.uta.fi/BTKbase/) shows that mutations in all domains of the Btk gene cause the disease, although there is a remarkable but unexplained absence of missense mutations in the SH3 domain (107). So far, no correlation has been observed between the position of the mutation and phenotypic variables such as age at time of diagnosis or severity of the clinical or immunological symptoms. Therefore, this heterogeneity might be related to other genetic or environmental factors.

In contrast to XLA, Btk deficiency in the mouse is not associated with a major early B cell developmental block, but rather with impaired maturation and poor survival of peripheral B cells. This *xid* phenotype is present both in the CBA/N strain of mice carrying an Arg28 missense mutation within the Btk PH domain (108–111) and in mice with a targeted disruption of Btk in their germ line (89, 112). Btk-deficient mice have ~50% fewer B cells in the periphery and manifest a specific arrest of peripheral B cell differentiation within the immature B cell pool at the progression of IgM<sup>high</sup> to IgM<sup>low</sup>AA4<sup>+</sup>CD23<sup>+</sup> transitional B cells (113–115). Using in vivo competition assays based on the phenomenon of X chromosome inactivation in Btk<sup>+/−</sup> or heterozygous *xid* female mice (89, 116, 117), it was shown that the immature IgM<sup>high</sup>IgD<sup>low</sup> B cell population in the periphery still contains a substantial proportion of Btk-deficient cells, whereas in the mature IgM<sup>low</sup>IgD<sup>high</sup> follicular B cell population these cells are virtually absent. In the peritoneum of Btk-deficient mice, the population of CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1 B cells is lacking, whereas marginal zone (MZ) B cells are present in normal numbers in the spleen. As the preferential clonal survival of MZ B cells requires functional Btk, Btk-deficient MZ B cells have a severely reduced life span (118). In Btk<sup>+/−</sup> female mice, Btk-deficient marginal zone B cells have a strong selective disadvantage in vivo, as Btk<sup>−</sup>/lacZ<sup>+</sup> cells were undetectable in the CD23<sup>−</sup>CD21<sup>+</sup> fraction of MZ B cells (R.W. Hendriks, unpublished). *Xid* mice have low levels of serum IgM and IgG3, whereas the levels of other isotypes are normal. They do not respond to thymus-independent type 2 polysaccharide antigens, but respond normally to thymus-dependent antigens (109, 112, 119). Btk is known to have a critical function in BCR-directed cell cycle induction in mature B cells. Anti-IgM-stimulated Btk-deficient B cells do not progress into cell division, exhibiting a high rate of apoptosis owing to a decreased ability to induce the antiapoptosis regulatory protein Bcl-X<sub>L</sub> (120–122). Btk-deficient B cells show normal proliferation induced via CD40 (112, 120). As mature B cell differentiation is critically controlled by parallel maturation and survival signals through the BCR and CD40, a profound B cell defect was observed in mice expressing the *xid* mutation and simultaneously lacking T cells or functional CD40 (123–126).

## Btk and B Cell Receptor Signaling

Shortly after the identification of Btk, it was demonstrated that Btk is activated by BCR stimulation (127–129). Further biochemical studies in Btk-deficient cells

showed that Btk is an important regulator of BCR-induced calcium mobilization (10, 130). It is thought that Btk is targeted to the plasma membrane through interactions of its PH domain with phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-3,4,5,-P₃), a second messenger that is generated by PI3K (131, 132). Subsequently, Btk is phosphorylated by Syk or the Src family tyrosine kinase Lyn at position Y551 in the kinase domain, which promotes the catalytic activity of Btk and subsequently results in its autophosphorylation at Y223 (133). Although Y223 phosphorylation does not appear to influence the Btk catalytic activity, it prevents binding to the Wiskott Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) and increases the affinity to Syk (134). Concomitantly, Syk activation results in phosphorylation of SLP-65, thereby providing docking sites for Btk and PLCγ2 SH2 domains. In this pathway, activated Btk phosphorylates PLCγ2, once it is brought into close proximity of PLCγ2 by SLP-65 (133, 135–137) (see Figure 3A). Activated PLCγ2 hydrolyzes

![Figure 3](#fig3)

**Figure 3** Signaling pathways downstream from the pre-BCR that activate PLCγ2 in the mouse. (A) The classical SLP-65-dependent route, in which SLP-65 connects activated Btk and PLCγ2. In this pathway, Btk needs its catalytic activity to stimulate PLCγ2. (B) The SLP-65-independent pathway, in which Btk recruits PIP5K. In this pathway, Btk stimulates PLCγ2 independent of its kinase activity. For details and abbreviations, see text.
its substrate, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5,-P₂), resulting in the production of the secondary messengers DAG and IP3. Consistent with this model, mice with targeted mutations in PI3K, SLP-65, or PLCγ2 all exhibit phenotypes similar to Btk mutant mice (52–55, 138–140).

IP3 mediates the opening of intracellular calcium stores, which subsequently activates PKCβ. Next, activated PKCβ phosphorylates IkB kinase α and thereby induces NF-κB activation, resulting in the upregulation of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-XL and cyclin D2 (141–143). At the same time, PKCβ acts as a feedback loop inhibitor of Btk activation by phosphorylating the serine residue at position 180 in the TH domain of Btk. This phosphorylation counteracts Btk activity, as mutation of S180 is associated with hyperphosphorylation, increased membrane localization of Btk, and enhanced BCR-induced Ca²⁺ signaling. Another negative regulatory mechanism of Btk function is provided by SH2-containing inositol phosphatase (SHIP), which is activated upon FcγRIIB coligation to the BCR. By reducing the level of PtdIns-3,4,5,-P₃, SHIP regulates the association of Btk with the membrane through PH domain-phosphoinositol lipid interactions (137, 144).

The PH domain gain-of-function mutant E41K (Glu-to-Lys) shows increased membrane localization and phosphorylation of Btk in quiescent cells, independent of PI3K activity, bringing Btk in close proximity of other BCR signaling molecules (132, 145). The E41K mutation, which was isolated using a retroviral random mutagenesis scheme, was shown to induce transformation of NIH 3T3 fibroblasts in soft agar cultures and factor-independent growth of the IL-5-dependent pro-B cell line Y16 (145). The E41K transforming capacity is augmented by mutation of the main auto-phosphorylation site at Y223 in the SH3 domain (146). Expression of E41K-Btk in Ramos B cells enhances the sustained increase in intracellular calcium following BCR cross-linking (130). To analyze whether constitutive activation of Btk results in enhanced proliferation or malignant transformation of cells in the B cell lineage in vivo, transgenic mice were generated that expressed E41K or E41K-Y223F mutant Btk. However, in transgenic mice in which expression of E41K mutant human Btk was driven by the B cell-specific CD19 promoter or the MHC class II Ea locus control region, B cell development was almost completely arrested in the bone marrow or the spleen, respectively (147, 148). Those few residual B cells present were efficiently driven into terminal IgM plasma cell differentiation and did not give rise to B cell lymphoma (147, 148). Nevertheless, expression of E41K Btk enhanced blast formation of splenic B cells in culture, either with or without mitogens. These findings suggest that expression of the E41K-Btk mimics BCR occupancy by autoantigens. We were also unable to detect any in vivo potentiating effects of the Y223F mutation on the phenotype of E41K-Btk mice, as expression of the E41K or E41K-Y223F Btk mutants resulted in parallel phenotypes, whereby the extent of B cell deletion was dose dependent (75). Also, transgenic expression of the Y223F mutant Btk under the control of the CD19 promoter did not result in a phenotype, but could fully correct the features of the Btk-deficient phenotype (149). Because the SH3 domain has specificity for the N-terminal proline-rich region of the Btk TH domain, investigators have hypothesized that intra- or intermolecular
interaction between the TH and SH3 domains might have an important regulatory function (150). However, our findings indicate that Y223 autophosphorylation-dependent interactions are not essential for Btk function in B cell development in vivo. This may also explain the remarkable absence of missense mutations in the Btk SH3 domain in a total of 155 missense mutations identified so far in XLA families (107), while on the basis of SH3 domain size about 10 of these should be located within the SH3 domain.

Taken together, in contrast to the ability of Btk mutants to induce transformation of fibroblasts in vitro, there is no evidence for an oncogenic function of Btk in B cells in vivo. In this context, it is remarkable that the Btk family member Bmx/Etk has been implicated in the progression of several tumors. Although Etk did not itself induce transformation, it is a critical mediator of Src-induced cell transformation and STAT-3 activation in liver epithelial cells (151) and controls proliferation and tumorigenic growth of mammary epithelial cancer cells (152).

## Btk and Pre-BCR Signaling

Although Btk was found to be phosphorylated after cross-linking of Ig-$\beta$ on RAG-2-deficient pro-B cells (7), the function of Btk downstream of the pre-B cell receptor in the mouse has been unclear for some time. In general, no striking differences were observed in the absolute numbers, production rate, or kinetics of turnover of pre-B cells, when $xid$ or Btk-deficient mice were compared with wild-type control mice (89, 109, 112, 153). Only Cancro et al. (154) reported a diminished pre-B cell production rate in CBA/N$xid$ mice, but this was accompanied by an increased proportional survival of pre-B cells, resulting in a normal size of the immature B cell pool. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence point to an important role for Btk at the developmental progression of pre-B cells into immature B cells in the mouse: $(a)$ Btk-deficient pre-B cells show an increased proliferative response to IL-7, as detected in long-term Whitlock-Witte bone marrow cultures and in IL-7-driven fetal liver or adult bone marrow cultures (155–157); $(b)$ Btk-deficient cells have a selective disadvantage in contributing to the IgM${}^{+}$IgD${}^{-}$B220${}^{+}$ immature B cell population in the bone marrow of Btk${}^{+/ -}$ female mice (89); $(c)$ during the transition of large cycling to small resting pre-B cells, Btk-deficient cells fail to downregulate efficiently the expression of the sialoglycoprotein CD43, the metallopeptidase BP-1, or SLC, and Btk-deficient cells also show impaired induction of cell surface expression of the CD2 adhesion molecule, the IL-2R and MHC class II (157); $(d)$ Btk-deficient cells manifest a specific developmental delay within the small pre-B cell compartment of $\sim 3$ hours when compared with wild-type cells (157); $(e)$ Btk-deficient B cells have reduced Ig$\lambda$L chain usage, implicating Btk in the activation of gene rearrangements at the $\lambda$L chain locus (158); $(f)$ pre-B cells that lack both Btk and SLP-65 show an almost complete arrest in development, pointing to a synergistic role for Btk and SLP-65 in the developmental progression of pre-B cells (75, 160); and, lastly, $(g)$ Btk cooperates with SLP-65 as a tumor suppressor in pre-B cells (75).

Collectively, these findings on the role of Btk in Btk-deficient mice demonstrate that Btk in human and mouse acts at distinct stages in pre-B cell development. Whereas in human Btk is critical for the induction of pre-B cell expansion, in mouse Btk plays an essential role to limit pre-B cell proliferation. Although more experiments are required to explain the differential role of Btk in the two species, this may well be related to the fact that pre-B cell proliferation in mouse, in contrast to human, is crucially dependent on IL-7. IL-7R signaling activates the Ras/Raf/MEK/MAP kinase pathway independent of Btk (7). To date, no IL-7-like growth factor has been found to regulate early B cell development in human and therefore it is possible that the expansion of pre-BCR positive cells is exclusively dependent on pre-BCR signaling and downstream Btk activation. Another way to explain the differences between XLA and *xid* phenotypes is a differential compensation for the loss of Btk by Tec family members. Although Tec-deficient mice show normal B cell development, an almost complete block at the CD43<sup>+</sup>B220<sup>+</sup> large pre-B cell stage was reported in Btk/Tec-double-deficient mice (159). Therefore, one can conclude that Tec kinase can partially compensate for the loss of Btk function at the developmental progression of large cycling into small resting pre-B cells. However, the total numbers of pre-B cells in the Btk/Tec-double-mutant mice were similar to those in wild-type or single-mutant mice. Moreover, in vivo BrdU labeling experiments indicate that the proliferative activity of the pre-B cell population is not significantly different among wild-type, Tec-deficient, Btk-deficient, or Tec/Btk-double-deficient mice (W. Ellmeier, personal communication). These findings indicate that, in the mouse, pre-B cell proliferation is intact, even in the absence of both Tec and Btk. In contrast, in XLA pre-B cell proliferation is severely affected, and therefore a differential ability of Tec to compensate for Btk in humans and mice cannot explain the phenotypic differences between XLA and *xid*.

## Btk Acts as a Tumor Suppressor in SLP-65-Deficient Pre-B Cells

The model in which the interaction of Btk with phosphorylated SLP-65 is critical to Btk's ability to activate PLCγ2 was challenged by the finding of a severe phenotype in the SLP-65/Btk-double-mutant mice (160). Whereas mice deficient for SLP-65 or Btk show only a partial arrest at the large cycling pre-B cell stage, a nearly complete block is present in SLP-65/Btk-double-deficient mice. Therefore, the two molecules not only function in a single BCR signal transduction pathway, but they also function independently in parallel pathways. Btk and SLP-65 have a synergistic role in the developmental progression of large cycling pre-B cells, including the downregulation of the expression of the pre-BCR and the induction of CD2, CD25, and MHC class II expression (75). Although Btk-deficient mice do not develop pre-B cell tumors, we observed that Btk cooperates with SLP-65 as a tumor suppressor. The incidence of pre-B cell lymphomas was significantly higher in SLP-65/Btk-double-mutant mice because at 16 weeks of age ~75% of these mice

(12 out of 16) developed a pre-B cell lymphoma, compared with SLP-65–single-deficient mice (~5%, 3 out of 66). Conversely, transgenic B cell-specific low-level expression of a constitutive active form of human Btk, the E41K-Y223F mutant (see below), prevented tumor formation in SLP-65/Btk-double-mutant mice (75). In the bone marrow, expression of the Btk mutant partially corrected the maturation defects of pre-B cells, including the modulation of SLC expression. These results indicate that constitutively active Btk can compensate for the loss of SLP-65 tumor suppressor function.

The nature of the cooperation of Btk with SLP-65 remains to be identified, although it is conceivable that the increased frequency of pre-B cell lymphoma development in SLP-65/Btk-double-mutant mice may simply reflect the increased pool size of proliferating pre-B cells in double-mutant mice (75, 160). Alternatively, the concomitant absence of Btk may contribute to tumor formation by changing not only the number of cycling pre-B cells but also their properties, such as proliferative capacity, apoptosis susceptibility or V(D)J recombination activity. Btk likely has a role in a SLP-65-independent pathway in pre-B cells. In this context, it is important to note that recent data obtained in the mature B cell line A20 demonstrate that Btk can activate PLCγ2 in such a parallel pathway (161). The PH domain of Btk binds to phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate-5-kinases (PIP5Ks), the enzymes that synthesize PtdIns-4,5-P2, which is a common substrate shared by both PI3K and PLCγ2 (see Figure 3B). The recruitment of the Btk-PIP5Ks complex to plasma membrane lipid rafts initiates a positive feedback loop that allows Btk to stimulate the production of the substrate for PI3K, leading to continued PtdIns-3,4,5,-P₃ synthesis, which is required for sustained Btk localization to the plasma membrane. As PtdIns-4,5-P₂ is also a substrate for PLCγ2, the shuttling function of Btk also provides substrate for PLCγ2 in a SLP-65-independent fashion. If the association of Btk with PIP5Ks is also operational in pre-B cells, such a feed-forward PLCγ2 activation loop could explain the synergistic roles of Btk and SLP-65 in these cells.

The shuttling mechanism that allows Btk to stimulate PtdIns-4,5-P₂ production does not appear to require Btk kinase activity, as overexpression of kinase-inactive Btk has been shown to stimulate PtdIns-3,4,5,-P₃ production by PI3K (137, 161). Moreover, kinase-inactive Btk was able to partially or fully reconstitute BCR-stimulated calcium flux in Btk-deficient DT40 chicken B cells (10, 162) or mouse splenic B cells (163). Moreover, transgenic overexpression of the kinase-inactive human Btk K430R mutant also induced NF-κB activation and Bcl-XL and cyclin D2 expression upon BCR stimulation in mature B cells (149). Expression of physiological levels of K430R Btk in pre-B cells normalized λ L chain usage and partially reconstituted the impaired pre-B cell maturation and IL-7 responsiveness in Btk-deficient mice. Although these findings imply that in pre-B cells Btk partially functions as an adapter molecule independent of its kinase activity, it remains possible that Btk adapter function depends on the presence of SLP-65, which in this context might serve as a scaffold molecule to bring other kinases, such as Src-like kinases or Syk, in close proximity to Btk and PLCγ2. However, it has recently been

reported that the site-specific tyrosine phosphorylation of the PLCγ2 SH2-SH3 linker mediated by Btk cannot be mediated by Syk (164). To establish that SLP-65 is not required for Btk adapter function, we crossed transgenic mice expressing the kinase inactive K430R-Btk mutant onto a SLP-65-deficient background. We observed that kinase-inactive Btk was able to rescue the severe developmental arrest at the pre-B cell stage present in SLP-65/Btk-double-mutant mice (163). Moreover, as the frequencies of pre-B cell tumor development in SLP-65-deficient mice and in K430R-Btk transgenic mice on a SLP-65/Btk-double-deficient background were similar (163), we conclude that Btk exerts its tumor suppressor function in pre-B cells as an adapter protein, independent of its kinase activity. This finding is consistent with two parallel Btk signaling pathways, whereby Btk tumor suppressor activity resides in the SLP-65-independent and kinase-activity-independent PIP5K shuttle function of Btk (see Figure 3A,B).

In addition, Btk/PI3K-double-deficient mice were reported to have more severe defects than either single-mutant mouse in terms of B cell numbers in the spleen and in vitro proliferative capacity of B cells (143). As Btk membrane recruitment or tyrosine phosphorylation appear unaffected by PI3K inhibitors or in PI3K-deficient cells (137, 143, 165), Btk can also be recruited to the plasma membrane through a mechanism independent of interactions between the PH domain and PtdIns-3,4,5,-P₃, e.g., by phosphorylated SLP-65 (see Figure 3A).

Although SLP-65 deficiency and pre-BCR expression are required for the development of pre-B cell leukemia, the molecular mechanism of the malignant transformation of SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells and the exact role of RAG in the process of transformation still require further investigations. The fact that mice deficient for other components of the pre-BCR signaling machinery do not develop leukemia suggests a unique role for SLP-65 as the crucial pre-BCR signaling element that mediates differentiation and prevents leukemia. Tumor development is not related to the severity of the pre-B cell block. Mice that are Btk/Tec-double-deficient have an almost complete arrest at the pre-B cell stage, which is more severe than the arrest observed in SLP-65-deficient mice, but they do not appear to develop pre-B cell leukemia (W. Ellmeier, personal communication).

## CONCLUDING REMARKS

Proliferation and differentiation are highly coordinated processes during B cell development. This review underlines the fact that independent pre-BCR signal transduction pathways regulate pre-B cell proliferation and differentiation simultaneously. Recent studies reveal that SLP-65 in association with Btk is the central regulator that promotes pre-B cell differentiation. In the SLP-65-deficient pre-B cells, the equilibrium between proliferation and differentiation is shifted toward proliferation, leading to an increased incidence of leukemia development. However, more work is necessary to characterize the downstream effects of SLP-65-mediated signaling and to understand how SLP-65 limits pre-B cell proliferation.

The identification of the signaling proteins and molecular mechanisms that regulate pre-B cell proliferation and differentiation may provide deeper insights into the process of leukemia development and may lead to novel strategies for tumor treatments.
