Summary: It is important to understand how T-cell antigen receptor
(TCR) engagement and signaling are regulated throughout an immune
response. This review examines the dynamics of surface TCR expression
and signaling capacity during thymic and effector T-cell development.
Although the TCR can undergo vast changes in surface expression, T cells
remain capable of sustaining TCR engagement for long periods of time.
This may be achieved by a combination of mechanisms that involve (a)
controlling the quantity of surface TCR available for ligand interaction
and (b) controlling the quality of surface TCR expression during T-cell
activation. TCR signaling itself appears to be one of the main quantitative
modulators of surface TCR expression, and it can cause both downregulation
and upregulation at different times of T-cell activation. Recent studies
indicate that the degree of upregulation is tunable by the strength of
antigenic stimulation. There is evidence that qualitatively distinct forms of
the TCR exist, and their potential role in sustained antigenic signaling is
also discussed. A goal of future studies will be to better characterize these
modulations in surface TCR expression and to clarify their impact on the
regulation of immune responses.

Introduction
The T-cell antigen receptor (TCR) endows T cells with
antigenic specificity, and thus it links clonal selection to adaptive
immunity and tolerance. Although some T cells express γδ
TCRs, most peripheral T cells in mice and humans express αβ
TCRs, which are triggered in response to foreign peptides
presented on molecules encoded within the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).
As is well documented, these T cells also recognize and react to
foreign MHC molecules in both peptide-dependent and
peptide-independent fashions (1). The frequency of alloreactive T cells is extremely high, with estimates of up to 10% (2),
greatly exceeding that of T cells reactive to foreign peptides.
Thus, understanding how the TCR and its signals are regulated
is of clear importance for developing novel approaches to
control both conventional immune responses and allograft
rejection.

Analogous to immunoglobulins (Igs), the genes for both α and β TCR subunits contain variable (V), diversity (D), and joining (J) regions; recombinase activity as well as N- and P-nucleotide addition can generate up to 10⁹ possible rearrangements during ontogeny (3). An additional layer of complexity is that TCR engagement can transduce distinct signals or lead to different outcomes, both qualitatively and quantitatively, depending on the affinity and concentration of the ligand, as well as the timing and costimulatory context of antigen presentation (4–7). For example, in some cases TCR engagement can cause T cells to develop either of two possible ‘opposite’ functional responses: positive versus negative thymic selection, peripheral T-cell survival versus death, or clonal expansion versus anergy. The extent of TCR engagement can also cause T cells to generate graded responses, an example being whether stimulated T cells will undergo few or many rounds of cell division (8, 9). How the TCR as a single receptor can be at the crux of such signaling and functional diversity is a question under intense investigation.

T cells require a sustained period of TCR occupancy in order to produce effector functions in response to antigenic stimulation. One group demonstrated that 6–40 h of TCR engagement committed naïve CD4⁺ T cells to proliferate, while several days of TCR engagement was needed to induce T-helper 2 polarization (10, 11). In recent years, the serial triggering (12), serial encounter (13), and immunological synapse (14) models of T-cell activation have offered explanations regarding the precise mechanisms by which such sustained signaling is achieved. Common to these models is a reliance on surface TCR expression level as a critical factor in determining T-cell responses to antigen, as this level dictates the quantity of TCR engagement possible for T cells. Both thymic development and peripheral T-cell activation include a dynamic modulation in surface TCR expression in response to strong TCR signaling. Concentrating on αβ T cells, we review what is known about how surface TCR expression is regulated during thymic and mature effector T-cell development, and examine how changes in expression levels are believed to influence T-cell responses. We also comment on potential qualitative changes in surface TCR expression during these processes. An increasing understanding of the regulation of surface TCR expression impacts our view of how T cells are able to sustain antigenic signaling for prolonged periods of time.

Surface expression, subunit composition, and stoichiometry of the αβ T-cell antigen receptor

The complete TCR/CD3 is a multicomponent ensemble consisting of the antigen-specific TCR αβ heterodimer in noncovalent association with the invariant CD3 γ, δ, ε, and ζ chains (15, 16). Each subunit is a type I membrane-spanning protein with a single transmembrane domain. Except for ζ, each is a member of the Ig superfamily, and except for ε and ζ, each is a glycoprotein. Nascent TCR/CD3 subunits are translocated from polyribosomes directly into the rough endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane (15). A primordial core complex is assembled, the most basic unit of which may be the CD3, εγ and εδ dimers (17). TCR α and β subunits are added separately to the core, followed by the association of the CD3 ζ homodimer in the ER (18, 19) or possibly in the Golgi apparatus (20). Unassembled TCR α, β, and CD3 δ chains rapidly undergo proteasomal degradation, while unassembled CD3 γ, ε, and ζ are retained in the ER (16, 21–23). As surface TCR expression is severely hindered or abolished in the absence of any one of its subunits (21, 22, 24–26), any subunit has the potential to be synthetically limiting (27, 28). However, in unstimulated cells, the level of surface TCR expression is not thought to be limited by protein synthesis, but by post-translational mechanisms (15, 29). After synthesis and assembly are complete, conformational maturation (glycosylation, carbohydrate modification, and perhaps other events) is thought to occur over several hours, while the TCR transits from the ER through the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane along the secretory pathway (30).

The precise stoichiometry of the surface TCR/CD3 complex is still a matter of debate at several different levels (Fig. 1). First, the subunit composition of each TCR/CD3 ‘holomer’ is usually represented as either TCR(αβ)₁CD3(εγ)(εδ)(ζζ) (Fig. 1A) (31, 32), or as TCR(αβ)₂CD3(εγ)(εδ)(ζζ) (Fig. 1B) (17, 33), although other structures have been proposed (reviewed in 34). In favor of a single αβ-containing stoichiometry, one study showed that two distinct transgenic αβ heterodimers failed to coimmunoprecipitate, despite having been coexpressed at the cell surface in murine TCR-transgenic T cells (31). However, a subsequent report revealed that one of the two αβ pairs in these mice is expressed in five- to 10-fold excess of the other; additionally, mismatched αβ pairs are also prominently expressed (35). Therefore, the failure of the prevalent αβ heterodimer to coimmunoprecipitate the minor αβ [the data shown in Punt et al. (31)] may have been due to these expression differences. Nevertheless, a more recent study showed that TCR(αβ) was monomeric at the stage when assembly in ER microsomes was complete and argued that this structure is likely to be expressed at the plasma membrane in T cells (32).

In favor of a multimeric αβ-containing structure, a separate study succeeded in coimmunoprecipitating two distinct

β-chains from T cells in dual β-chain-expressing mice (33). This observation was cited in support of the notion that the inclusion of two αβ heterodimers in each TCR/CD3 holomer would rectify a transmembrane charge imbalance imposed by the presence of only a single αβ (36). Recently, our group has coimmunoprecipitated endogenously generated Vα2+ TCRs together with the transgenic Vα13+ clonotype TCR from dual-specificity T cells in DO11.10 mice (Schrum, Palmer, and Turka, unpublished data). Although our data favor the expression of multimeric αβ structures, it remains unclear at this point why different experimental systems have yielded opposing results regarding the number of αβ heterodimers associated in isolated complexes.

A related question is to what degree is the subunit composition of surface TCR holomers heterogeneous. In mice, up to 20% of TCRs may contain CD3 ζ expressed as a disulfide-linked heterodimer with CD3 η, a product of alternative splicing of the ζ transcript (37). Also, both CD3 γ and ζ knockout mice reveal that a low level of surface TCR expression can be achieved in the absence of these subunits (38, 39). This expression may be made possible by inefficient substitution of other subunits for those which are missing, although in ζ knockout mice, the ζ family members η and FcR γ do not substitute for the missing ζ-chain (40). Whether or to what extent heterogeneous subunit composition occurs in mice that express all TCR/CD3 subunits is unknown.

Finally, whatever the subunit composition, TCR holomers themselves could associate to form multimers of holomers (17, 41, 42). Using sucrose density gradients and mild detergents, one group reported surface TCR/CD3 complexes to be predominantly dimeric (16-20S), while complexes isolated from the ER were smaller (7S) (15). Perhaps the TCR holomers that exit the ER are composed of monomeric TCR(αβ). These holomeric complexes might then coassociate during conformational maturation in the Golgi apparatus and be expressed as multimers of holomers by the time they reach the plasma membrane. Indeed, the cited experiments involving the coimmunoprecipitation of two αβ TCRs do not distinguish whether such coassociated TCRs are expressed as part of a single holomeric complex (Fig. 1B) or some multiple thereof (Fig. 1C). The hypothesis that TCR/CD3 may be expressed as multimers of holomers is currently under investigation.

The issue of TCR stoichiometry is important to resolve in order to understand how the TCR manages the diverse signaling pathways under its supervision. In contrast to αβ TCRs, γδ TCRs are assembled with much less CD3 δ in the complex, which may have effects on γδ TCR signaling (43, 44). In fact,

γδ TCRs are expressed well in CD3 δ-deficient mice, while αβ TCRs are not (45). Recent reports indicate that both αβ and γδ TCRs can acquire a new subunit constituency following T-cell stimulation. In human αβ T cells, CD3 ζ is replaced with FcR γ (46), and in γδ T cells a differentially glycosylated form of CD3 γ is involved (47). It is difficult to discern whether these inducible subunit exchanges are partially responsible for the changes in signaling capacity that accompany T-cell activation. However, experimentally manipulated alterations in TCR stoichiometry have yielded functional consequences and have been crucial in revealing the different signaling arms of the TCR. Two groups showed that αβ TCR complexes with diminished or ablated CD3δ association were unable to transduce positive selection signals to thymocytes, while maintaining negative selection signals intact (48–50). Clearly, it will be important to obtain more definitive measurements of TCR stoichiometry in T cells of various phenotypes and states of activation in order to better understand what ‘surface TCR expression’ really means.

Surface T-cell antigen receptor expression is tightly controlled and involved in the efficiency of thymocyte selection

The precise mechanisms by which TCR signaling induces positive and negative selection in the thymus are not completely understood. A ‘differential avidity’ model of thymic selection has been proposed, wherein positive selection results from engaging fewer TCRs than that occurs during negative selection (51–53). However, a number of studies support the idea that the decision between positive and negative selection relies primarily on the ability of ligands of differing affinity to generate qualitatively distinct TCR signals (reviewed in 7). Here, the dose of the selecting ligand is thought to be much less important, except for a relatively small ‘affinity window’, where lower doses of peptide lead to positive selection and higher doses of peptide lead to negative selection (Palmer, manuscript in preparation). It is implied that the kinetic parameters of ligand/receptor interactions, rather than the absolute number of occupied TCRs, constitute the major criteria by which positive versus negative selection decisions are made. Consistent with this idea, experiments that have altered the surface TCR expression level of developing thymocytes have tended to alter the efficiency of positive or negative selection, without influencing the outcome of selection itself (see below).

Surface TCR expression is dramatically modulated as part of the natural T-cell-maturation program. Immature CD4−/CD8−(double negative, DN) thymocytes rearrange β-loci and then audition the β-chains by expressing them in heterodimers with the monomorphic pTα chain. Productive heterodimerization of this ‘preTCR’ signals to the thymocyte that an in-frame β-chain has been expressed, halting further DNA rearrangement of β-loci (54, 55). Surface expression of pre-TCR is observed during the expansion and differentiation of DN cells to CD4+/CD8+ (double positive, DP) thymocytes, a process called β-selection (56, 57). Interestingly, the pre-TCR signal is thought to be relayed without binding of pre-TCR to an extracellular ligand (58, 59). This ligand-independent function is considered unique to the pre-TCR, as T cells bearing mature αβ TCRs require both surface TCR expression and the presence of MHC-expressing APCs to survive (60–65).

At the DP stage, thymocytes first express the complete αβ TCR/CD3 complex and become subject to positive and negative selection. DP thymocytes transcriptionally silence the pTα gene, and rearrange their TCR α loci to produce α-chains that begin pairing with the β-chain (66). Relative to peripheral T cells, DP thymocytes express approximately 150–450%, the level of TCR/CD3 subunit mRNAs, but only approximately 10% the level of surface protein (67–69). Interestingly, this low level of surface TCR expression is controlled post-transcriptionally (69, 70). Even T cells from TCR-transgenic mice, which express αβ TCR aberrantly early at the DN stage, actively downregulate surface TCR expression to wildtype low levels upon maturation to the DP stage (71–74). What role, if any, does low-surface TCR expression play in determining the fate of DP thymocytes?

Several reports indicate that the surface TCR expression level of DP thymocytes affects the efficiency with which the processes of positive and negative selection are carried out. Studying mice bred to express two transgenic αβ TCRs, Dave et al. (35) showed that artificially low-surface expression of each TCR severely impaired or abolished positive selection and also partially blocked negative selection. However, ligands that normally induced negative selection in wildtype thymocytes did not induce positive selection in double transgenic cells, despite their lower TCR expression. On the other hand, Watanabe et al. (75) examined thymic selection in mice engineered to express CD3 η but not ζ, in which surface TCR expression is impaired and only a few mature T cells develop. Here, a peptide agonist which induced negative selection in wildtype thymocytes was able to induce positive selection in the mutant thymocytes in a dose-dependent manner. At a very high concentration (≥1 mM), the same peptide killed mutant thymocytes, but unlike the negative selection observed in wildtype thymocytes, this effect was not titratable. It is unclear whether these effects can

be solely attributed to the low-surface TCR expression of the mutant thymocytes as was supposed, or whether the change in CD3 subunit composition of these cells may have accounted for the effect on selection. We currently favor the latter explanation, as several studies have demonstrated that reduced CD3 ζ content in TCR/CD3 complexes is associated with a specific defect in TCR-dependent apoptosis induction (76–78). Recently, Sosinowski et al. (79) showed that Src-like adapter protein (SLAP) participates in the active surface TCR downregulation observed in DP thymocytes, but not mature T cells, from SLAP−/− mice expressed higher levels of surface TCR compared to wildtype. This finding correlated with a doubling in the number of CD4+/CD8− and CD4−/CD8+ (single positive, SP) thymocytes to develop, without a discernible effect on negative selection. Taken together, these data suggest that the surface TCR expression level on DP thymocytes controls the number of cells that will undergo positive and negative selection, without playing a major role on the TCR:ligand affinity measurement that decides between positive and negative selection.

Finally, those thymocytes which survive both positive and negative selection mature into SP cells and upregulate surface TCR expression before exiting the thymus for the periphery (69). This upregulation of surface expression is accompanied by changes in the glycosylation of T-cell surface proteins (80). Upon T-cell maturation, the CD8 coreceptor becomes sialylated, lowering its affinity for MHC class I (81). This and other alterations may lower the sensitivity of mature T cells to the low affinity, positively selecting ligands that are constitutively expressed.

In summary, steady-state surface TCR expression is regulated during thymocyte development. Throughout this period, alterations in TCR subunits (Pre-Tα versus TCR α) and glycosylation accompany the changes in TCR signaling characteristics that cause T-cell maturation. The precise reasons why these changes in surface TCR expression occur and what impact these processes may have on T-cell development and central tolerance are still not completely understood. Artificial modulations in TCR expression levels seem to affect the number of mature T cells produced by the thymus. Thus, the stages of thymocyte development not only correlate with controlled modulations in surface TCR expression but also likely depend on those modulations as part of the mechanism by which T-cell development is controlled.

Controls of surface T-cell antigen receptor expression in mature T cells

In resting peripheral T cells, surface TCR cycles between an intracellular endosomal compartment and the plasmamembrane (82–84). As a result of this cycling, approximately 30% of TCR may be intracellular in resting T cells (85). Constitutive internalization was recently shown to depend on a di-leucine motif in the cytoplasmic domain of CD3γ (86). Furthermore, there is some evidence that spontaneous TCR internalization is controlled by CD3ζ (87) and that this function of CD3ζ may in turn be influenced by TCR-interacting molecule (TRIM) (27). Although a single subunit is often followed as a marker for the entire TCR/CD3 complex, a few studies indicate that TCR αβ and CD3 subunits may have distinct trafficking routes and fates upon internalization (88–90). However, it is generally agreed that (a) at the time of export to the plasma membrane, TCR is expressed in its holomeric form (i.e., with all subunits included) and this holo-TCR is by far the most prevalent form expressed in the steady-state, and (b) stimulation leads to surface TCR downregulation of the entire complex, usually by increasing the rate of endocytosis (91) and/or increasing the intracellular retention and degradation of internalized TCRs (85, 92).

### Signal transduction-dependent surface T-cell antigen receptor downregulation

TCR engagement by agonist peptide/MHC complexes or anti-TCR/CD3 antibodies not only initiates TCR signaling but also causes surface TCR downregulation both in vitro and in vivo (64, 93–96). The magnitude of this effect depends on the dose and strength of agonist, the strongest stimuli resulting in the greatest downregulation. Unlike TCR agonists, partial agonist peptides cause intermediate TCR signaling and downregulation, while antagonist peptides execute neither (97, 98). These findings have led to a model of T-cell activation that begins with surface TCR engagement by ligand, followed by signal transduction via CD3 subunits, and internalization and retention of the TCR/CD3 complex (85). Once internalized, TCRα, TCRβ, CD3ε, and CD3ζ are known to be degraded in a lysosomal compartment, and it is thought that the other subunits follow a similar fate (85, 92, 99). This downregulation itself depends on the activity of Lck and Fyn Src-family kinases (100–102), and it may involve a coupling of the clathrin endocytic machinery with Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp)-mediated actin polymerization (103). Mathematical analyses have suggested the existence of a lag time between TCR engagement and internalization, predicting that TCR downregulation does not itself cause signaling but rather occurs as a result of signaling (104, 105).

Antigen-induced TCR downregulation has been proposed to be regulated with respect to specific antigen contact, for which there is contradictory evidence in different experimental systems. All studies to address this issue have utilized dual-specificity T cells, which express two distinct TCRs. On the one hand, human T-cell clones (95), a murine T-cell hybridoma (106), and naïve CD4⁺ murine T cells (8) were shown to only downregulate engaged and not bystander TCRs upon antigenic stimulation. On the other hand, a murine T-cell hybridoma (107), Jurkat cells (96, 108), and murine T cells coexpressing TCRs and a CD25–CD3ζ chimera (96), all demonstrated downregulation of both engaged and non-engaged TCR types. One speculation to explain this discrepancy is that the stronger the overall signaling in the T cell, the more non-engaged TCRs become downregulated by antigen. Because generalized surface TCR downregulation is known to be affected by signal transduction pathways, the best characterized being protein kinase C (PKC) (see Table 1 and discussion below), it makes sense that strong signaling through TCR and other receptors might eventually lead to generalized TCR downregulation. According to this hypothesis, three factors might lead to generalized TCR downregulation by antigen: (a) the cells being tested are actively signaling in response to other growth factors or are not truly ‘resting’ prior to assay; (b) the cells being tested hyperexpress surface TCR and thus respond very strongly to stimulation; or (c) the potency of the TCR ligand is very strong, as might be argued for anti-CD3 monoclonal antibody (mAb) or superantigen. Currently, this hypothesis remains untested, and there is no consensus regarding the conditions that determine whether both specific and bystander TCRs become downregulated by antigen.

Regardless of which TCRs are internalized, dose-dependent surface TCR downregulation is reported to be maximal by 5 h and can be maintained for up to several days post-stimulus (104, 109–113). TCR stimulation initially downregulates subunit mRNAs as well, by substantially decreasing the transcription rate and mRNA half-lives within 4 h of the antigenic stimulus (114, 115). Transcription of subunit mRNAs is subsequently re-induced and enhanced by 12–24 h (116–119).

PKC activation, as elicited by phorbol ester treatment, can cause surface TCR downregulation (120–122) by a mechanism involving a di-leucine internalization motif and serine 126 on the intracellular domain of CD3γ (123, 124). Unlike antigen-stimulated TCRs, these internalized TCRs are not degraded but are retained as long as PKC stimulation persists, and afterwards they are recycled back to the surface. In contrast, in the presence of both phorbol ester and antigen, TCRs are degraded rather than recycled (102).

TCR signaling also induces production of ceramide, a pleiotropic lipid second messenger (125) that can have two different

If the pathway targeted by the reagent is potentially downstream of TCR signaling, then it is indicated as such. 'Onset' refers to how quickly surface TCR modulation occurs in response to the reagent, and 'duration' refers to how long the modulation lasts once the reagent has been removed. Post-modulation, the subsequent antigenic signaling capacity of T cells is scored only if this point has been specifically addressed experimentally. All data refer to αβT cells. NA, not applicable.

effects on surface TCR expression. Brief exposure to exogenous ceramide causes T cells to upregulate surface TCR expression by a post-translational mechanism, increasing the recruitment of intracellular TCR to the plasma membrane (29). Upon ceramide removal, surface TCR levels rapidly return to normal. Several hours of ceramide exposure, however, causes surface TCR downregulation by a mechanism dependent on caspase activity (126). Because many receptor-signaling pathways other than TCR also induce ceramide (125), its overall role in surface TCR expression during T-cell stimulation is difficult to predict.

- Inhibition of the PP2A family of serine/threonine phosphatases has also been reported to induce a biphasic effect on surface TCR expression. While low concentrations cause downregulation, high concentrations cause upregulation (127). This study reported that the changes in TCR expression were apparently unrelated to whether PP2A resulted in the de-phosphorylation of CD3γ in vitro (128).

Two other signaling pathways are reported to produce prolonged surface TCR downregulation in T-cell hybridomas. Extended exposure to tumor necrosis factor (TNF) downregulates surface TCR expression by minimizing CD3ζ transcription (129). T cells then require several days to recover normal surface TCR levels upon TNF removal. In contrast, extended exposure to glucocorticoids, such as dexamethasone, results in long-lasting surface TCR downregulation without affecting subunit synthesis (130). Because these observations were made using T-cell hybridomas, it is unclear whether antigen or cellular activation are required to make normal T cells susceptible to surface TCR regulation of this type.

Table 1 summarizes the known effects of signaling pathways that can regulate surface TCR expression. As most of these pathways are downstream of TCR signaling, we propose that the TCR itself is a major regulator responsible for perturbations of its own surface expression. It is likely that short-term perturbations are cell-intrinsic, specific for the T cell that participates in TCR engagement. However, possible cell-extrinsic effects cannot be ruled out and may play a role in the case of long-term TCR modulations. Perhaps TNF or glucocorticoids can cause bystander T cells to depress surface TCR expression without TCR occupancy on the affected cells. How cell-extrinsic signals might influence surface TCR levels and T-cell responsiveness could be important to investigate.

T-cell subsets and surface T-cell antigen receptor expression

We are not aware of any reported difference in surface TCR expression levels between CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells. Moreover, there is no obvious difference in TCR expression between T helper-1 versus T helper-2 cell subsets (for example, see 131). Interestingly, surface TCR expression levels between naïve and memory T cells are also reported to be identical (131, 132), suggesting a general equivalency among all quiescent T cells with respect to surface TCR expression level. However, both downregulation and upregulation of surface TCR level has been documented in activated T cells (109, 133, 134), consistent with the idea that active signal transduction can affect surface TCR expression level (Table 2).

Besides expressing other markers of constitutive activation, natural killer (NK) T cells have been shown to express less surface TCR than naïve conventional T cells (135). Additionally, a quantitative flow cytometric analysis of γδ T cells demonstrated that they express up to twofold higher surface CD3 than αβ T cells (136). The variations in surface TCR expression level attributed to different T-cell phenotypes may reflect the constitutive or activation-induced signaling pathways that operate in these cells. Whether this is the case or whether different lineages of T cells inherently control surface TCR expression uniquely has yet to be clarified.

Finally, both thymocytes and mature T cells can downregulate surface TCR expression when they become apoptotic.

(137–140). The precise signaling pathways responsible for this phenomenon are unknown, but caspase activity might be involved (126, 141). Some potentially toxic, but survivable, treatments have been reported to cause T cells to downregulate surface TCR expression. First, TCR downregulation occurred when purified murine CD8⁺ T cells were cultured in vitro without antigen for at least 4 days in the presence of exogenous interleukin-2 (142). Second, downregulation occurred when T cells were subjected to 8 h of heat shock, causing decreased CD3 ζ mRNA and reduced TCR responsiveness by a mechanism dependent on oxidative stress (143, 144). Oxidative stress in tumor-bearing mice has been reported to downregulate CD3 ζ expression and induce immunosuppression of T-cell responses (145). It could be important to learn the precise mechanisms by which such ‘toxic’ conditions affect TCR expression, and the molecular requirements for subsequent recovery of TCR expression and T-cell immune function.

Long-lived, ‘non-downregulatable’ surface T-cell antigen receptors?

Neither inhibiting protein synthesis nor inducing ligand-dependent TCR downregulation appear to be sufficient to remove all TCRs from the plasma membrane of T cells. A residual number of TCRs always remains at the cell surface, although signal amplification flow cytometry is sometimes required to detect it (65). The remaining number of TCRs after maximal ligand-induced downregulation may range from very few to up to 30% of the original number. Considering the long-term availability of TCR expression for antigen interaction, what is the possible significance of this observation?

After TCR downregulation, the residual surface TCR fraction is expected to be composed of (i) TCRs that have not been downregulated and (ii) new TCRs that are expressed to replenish the plasma membrane. Regarding new TCRs, some residual, non-downregulated TCR expression likely originates from intracellular TCRs being exported to the surface to replace TCRs that may continue to be engaged by antigen. However, this scenario better describes the dynamic process of prolonged TCR triggering that occurs after many hours of antigenic signaling (8). Instead, immediately following maximal ligand-induced TCR downregulation, a low level of surface TCR expression persists for a time with very little surface TCR replenishment. Lag times between ligand-induced TCR downregulation and surface TCR replenishment have been previously reported as <1 day for naïve murine T cells (8, 134) and several days for human T-cell clones (104, 109).

We have observed that stimulating BALB/c splenocytes for 5 h with saturating concentrations of anti-CD3 mAb causes downregulation of surface TCR expression by approximately 80%, and this downregulation is unaffected by the presence or absence of the protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide. A contribution of newly synthesized TCR to the nadir of TCR downregulation is undetectable during the early hours post-stimulation in this system. Furthermore, when excess anti-CD3 is removed after stimulation, surface TCR replenishment remains undetectable for at least an additional hour (Schrum, Pradhan, and Turka, work in progress). The observation that TCR/CD3 subunit mRNA transcripts are also initially down-regulated by TCR signaling (114, 115) also supports the idea that export of a large quantity of newly synthesized TCRs to replenish the plasma membrane does not occur immediately during the early hours following downregulation.

A portion of residual TCR expression probably results from the persistence of some surface TCRs, which for unknown reasons are difficult to downregulate. When Sousa and Carneiro (104) mathematically modeled the data of Valitutti et al. (95), they noticed the biphasic kinetics of TCR downregulation. They proposed that the plasma membrane contains two distinct pools of TCR, one that is downregulated quickly and one that is downregulated slowly. Initial downregulation is dominated by the fast pool, although the ensuing hours of TCR engagement involve the slow pool, for which surface TCR expression tapers asymptotically over time.

In an interesting parallel, antigen-independent surface TCR downregulation was recently shown to leave T cells with residual TCRs whose surface expression was long lived. Labrecque et al. (64) generated conditional TCR-expressing mice in which transcription of the OT-1 transgenic TCR could be reversibly inhibited by tetracycline administration. Under conditions of maximal inhibition, T cells retained 200–300 surface TCRs per T cell, and this expression was maintained for months. These residual surface TCRs seemed to represent intact TCR/CD3 complexes, as they could be detected by anti-TCR α, anti-TCR β or anti-CD3 ε mAbs. In separate studies, Polic et al. (65) generated inducible TCR Ca knockout mice using the Cre-lox system with type I interferon or pI/pC as inducer. Forty percent of CD4⁺ T cells and 80% of CD8⁺ T cells responded to pI/pC injection by deleting Ca (confirmed by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction). However, these cells retained surface expression of approximately 100 TCRs per cell for at least 49 days. Thus, even under conditions where TCR expression is genetically controlled, a small fraction of surface TCRs is clearly long lived.The inability to remove all TCRs from the surface in many well-characterized experimental systems leads us to speculate as to the possible origins of 'non-downregulable' TCRs in the presence of productive TCR engagement.

1 There is some degree of pre-existing heterogeneity among TCRs expressed at the plasma membrane of resting T cells. Two fractions of surface TCRs are known to be associated with lipid rafts (146, 147) and the actin cytoskeleton (148), although the relationship of these two TCR fractions in resting cells is unknown. Additionally, as discussed above, it has been hypothesized that the surface TCR population may be composed of TCR/CD3 complexes of heterogeneous subunit composition and multimeric structure (17). It is theoretically possible that a pre-existing subpopulation of surface TCRs is resistant to downregulation when engaged. What structural or biochemical properties determine, whether a given TCR is a member of one fraction or another, is completely unknown.

2 T-cell activation might induce heterogeneity among surface TCRs. T-cell stimulation can cause recruitment of TCRs to the actin cytoskeleton, recruitment into lipid rafts, the formation of contact patches, and polarization of the T-cell axis toward the stimulatory interface (14, 149, 150). Perhaps some of these activities can induce or coincide with biochemical changes that prevent some TCRs from being downregulated by antigen.

3 TCR downregulation might cease when the surface level has become too low to continue to mediate productive antigenic signaling. This proposal is based on two basic concepts: (i) the number of receptor-ligand complexes always depends on the quantity of both receptors and ligands and (ii) ligand binding and signaling are both required for TCR downregulation. As downregulation proceeds, surface TCR level eventually becomes too low to sustain productive TCR-ligand interactions. For this reason, TCR downregulation stabilizes at a low level of surface expression. Here, whether or not a particular TCR/CD3 complex is downregulated would depend entirely upon the antigen dose and the surface TCR level but not necessarily upon unique properties of any single receptor itself.

Regardless of the mechanism by which they maintain surface expression, residual TCRs do not appear to retain antigenic signaling capacity in restimulation assays. First, T cells that are optimally stimulated 1–3 days in vitro acquire an antigen refractory phenotype following surface TCR downregulation; they become less capable of producing cytokines or proliferating in response to antigenic restimulus for several days

(93, 109, 151, 152). Second, after gene silencing, the residual TCRs expressed by TCR-conditional mutant mice are insufficient to induce calcium flux, cytokine production or proliferation in response to antigen; these residual TCRs are also incapable of providing positive selection signals to DP thymocytes or long-term survival signals to mature T cells in vivo (64, 65). Third, we have observed that 6-h-stimulated T cells with low residual TCR levels have at least a 10-fold blunted capacity to induce tyrosine kinase activity upon anti-CD3 restimulation (Schrum and Turka, work in progress). Despite these observations, one hypothetical function of the TCRs that remain following downregulation could be to maintain an already-initiated antigenic encounter. The failed response to restimulation of the T cells bearing these residual TCRs might not reflect this function. Dustin and colleagues (150, 153) have previously proposed that the bulk of TCR downregulation may occur as an ‘investment’, while a mature immunological synapse is under construction. Once the synapse matures, 100–200 MHC molecules are required in the central cluster of the synapse to maintain stable contact and sustain antigenic signaling for hours. Although a low number of TCRs could be imagined to play a specialized role in sustaining antigenic signaling, there is currently no data to ascribe this function to the non-downregulated TCRs described above. Clearly, T cells with downregulated levels of surface TCR are severely impaired in their ability to initiate antigenic signals. Following downregulation, surface TCR replenishment is likely to play a large role in the ability of T cells to sustain antigenic signaling for prolonged periods of time.

Surface T-cell antigen receptor expression level is proportional to antigenic signaling capacity

The salient conclusion from all of these studies is that surface TCR downregulation always decreases and upregulation always increases antigenic signaling potential in mature T cells. No exception to this rule has been reported thus far, as long as T-cell phenotype (i.e. naïve or blast) remains constant in the comparison. This conclusion is consistent with the idea that the natural fluctuation in surface TCR expression during T-cell activation reflects a regulated fluctuation in signaling capacity during effector cell development. It is also consistent with the previously proposed idea that surface TCR downregulation might protect T cells from hyperstimulation leading to activation-induced cell death (AICD) (154, 155).

Surface T-cell antigen receptor replenishment and upregulation in mature T cells

Subsequent to downregulation, T-cell activation can induce recovery of surface TCR expression to a level that is twofold higher than the original (8, 133, 134, 156, 157). During the primary stimulation of naïve T cells, surface TCR replenishment commences within the first day. In our hands, it is most readily observed by removing the source of TCR stimulus following the early hours of TCR downregulation. This procedure facilitates the measurement of surface TCR replenishment in the controlled absence of continued ligand-induced internalization. Importantly, surface TCR replenishment can occur simultaneously with ongoing TCR engagement and internalization (8). Therefore, removing antigen to observe surface TCR replenishment does not induce TCR export but rather reveals TCR export by eliminating TCR downregulation.

Our data indicate that activation-induced surface TCR replenishment can be followed like a T-cell effector response: the new level of surface TCR expression observable several days into the response, increases in proportion to antigen dose, duration of stimulus, and degree of costimulation (134) (Schrum and Turka, manuscript in preparation). We stimulated naïve DO11.10/RAG2⁻/⁻ CD4⁺ T cells with antigen-loaded macrophages for either 6 or 18 h (Fig. 2). After these times, we removed the APCs and measured surface TCR recovery by flow cytometric analysis at various times. A stimulus of 6 h (Fig. 2, left), not enough time for most T cells to commit to undergo cell division (8), was also not enough time to 'reset' surface TCR expression to an upregulated level. Low-dose stimulus resulted in neither overt TCR downregulation nor upregulation over time. With high-dose stimulus, full

TCR downregulation occurred initially, and surface TCR expression required 4 days of culture to recover to original levels. However, high-dose stimulus for 18 h resulted in full surface TCR recovery to original levels within a day of stimulus withdrawal and an increase to 200% expression by day 4 (Fig. 2, right). Even low-dose stimulus for 18 h resulted in increasing surface TCR levels over time, although the effect was more modest. Thus, in this system, a strong stimulus of at least 1 day results in relatively rapid surface TCR recovery and supplies the near-depleted plasma membrane with a relatively large quantity of new TCRs.

The TCRs involved in surface replenishment and upregulation presumably originate from a newly synthesized pool, as engaged TCRs are degraded. Studies are lacking that examine TCR/CD3 mRNA, protein synthesis, and surface levels together, to precisely define the checkpoints at which activated T cells regulate their surface TCR expression. Nevertheless, a positive correlation between mRNA and surface TCR protein levels, as mature T cells undergo activation, can be inferred from separate studies. By 24 h postantigenic stimulus, subunit mRNA levels have recovered and are upregulated (116, 117, 119), while new TCRs replenish the plasma membrane. Thus, mRNA levels may correlate with the level of functional TCR within activated T cells, especially when surface TCR expression cannot be accurately measured due to continual TCR engagement and internalization.

Activation-induced surface TCR replenishment and upregulation have not been fully characterized. When upregulation occurs in vitro, surface TCRs remain highly expressed for 2–4 days, thereafter (134). Surface TCR upregulation was also observed in vivo one day after antigen was injected into TCR

with anti-I-Aᵈ-blocking monoclonal antibody. The x-axis indicates the total time of culture, up to 96 h, before the T cells were harvested. Surface TCR levels were measured by flow cytometry and by comparing the geometric mean fluorescence intensity (gMFI) of stimulated cells with that of unstimulated cells. Data from one of four experiments are shown. Detailed methods are described in Schrum and Turka (8).

Fig. 2. Kinetics and magnitude of surface T-cell receptor (TCR) recovery following the initial downregulation phase induced by TCR engagement. Naïve CD4⁺ DO11.10/RAG⁻/⁻ T cells were stimulated by 0.5 or 50 μg/mL OVA peptide-pulsed macrophages for either 6 h (left) or 18 h (right). Antigenic stimulus was then interrupted by removing the T cells from the presence of the macrophages and reculturing the T cells

transgenic mice (133). The length of time, during which TCRs remained highly expressed, was not determined in this study. The best way to determine how long surface TCR upregulation can endure would be to use a system wherein activated T cells recover from stimulation in vivo, in the absence of continued TCR engagement. The observation that T cells of both naïve and memory phenotype express equivalent surface TCR levels suggests that effector T cells renormalize their surface TCR level by the time they come to rest.

The functional consequences of surface TCR replenishment and upregulation are not fully defined. At the most basic level, replenishment may simply restore the antigenic sensitivity that was presumably blunted by downregulation. The slow recovery of surface TCR expression to original levels observed in Fig. 2 (left) supports this notion for cells that were not stimulated sufficiently to commit to cell division. For cells stimulated to proliferate, TCR upregulation might prepare cells for mitosis; the twofold increase in receptor expression would occur in preparation for partitioning of TCRs to daughter cells. However, one study showed that other T-cell surface proteins did not undergo equivalent upregulation with T-cell activation (133), indicating that the effect on TCR expression is specific. Another study showed that few T cells proliferated when stimulated in the presence of CD28 costimulatory blockade, but TCR upregulation was still induced (134). Therefore, surface TCR upregulation can occur independent of cell division.

Maximal surface TCR upregulation is induced, as T cells respond to costimulatory APCs loaded with high doses of strong agonist ligands for the TCR (Fig. 3). However, such stimuli first induce maximal TCR downregulation; only later, if antigen encounter terminates at the right time, recovering T cells maximally accumulate surface TCRs and upregulate expression. Does this sequence have a physiologic correlate? A recent study demonstrated that T cells stably interacted with antigen-pulsed dendritic cells in lymph nodes for 15 h. Subsequently, when observed between 36–48 h, proliferation, conjugate dissociation, and rapid T-cell migration predominated (158). Thus, the timing of T cell-APC contact appears to be controlled in secondary lymphoid organs. Perhaps this control constrains the timing of initial TCR engagement and makes subsequent TCR accumulation at the plasma membrane possible. According to this model, TCR downregulation would prevail during the early hours of T-cell stimulation, which would presumably protect T cells from hyperstimulation-induced death at this stage. At some point, TCR engagement would terminate or diminish, allowing surface TCR replenishment and upregulation to enhance antigenic sensitivity in time

Fig. 3. Dynamic modulations in surface T-cell receptor (TCR) expression during the progression from thymocyte to memory T cell. The expression level of αβ TCR by naïve T cells is defined here as '100%'. A change in the color of the line indicates a documented qualitative change in surface TCR expression, except for 'red', which indicates unknown/untested. Together with CD3 subunits, double negative (DN) thymocytes first express low surface levels of the preTCR (black), the pTα-chain paired with β-chain. β-selection accompanies transition to the double positive (DP) stage, where αβ TCR is first expressed (blue) at approximately 10% levels. Surface TCR level is upregulated, as single positive (SP) cells develop, and this level of surface expression is maintained in peripheral, mature naïve T cells. When T cells encounter a strong antigenic stimulus (•), surface TCR downregulation occurs. Surface TCR replenishment begins, but the newly expressed TCRs can also be engaged and downregulated as long as antigenic signaling continues. If TCR engagement ceases (*), surface TCR replenishment and upregulation are revealed as newly expressed TCRs accumulate at the plasma membrane. Sometime during this process, TCR ‘avidity maturation’ can occur, and human effector T cells may incorporate FcR γ instead of CD3 ζ in the TCR/CD3 complex (green line). The upregulated surface TCR expression level is thought to decline back to the naïve level as effector cells come to rest. Whether or not memory T cells express avidity-matured TCRs or invoke other qualitative changes in surface TCR expression is unknown (red).

for effector cell migration and function. Previous studies indicate that in the presence of antigen, T cells are sequestered from the circulation for 2–4 days before entering the efferent lymph (159, 160). Others have reported that primary stimulation in vivo can require 5 days for naïve T cells to proliferate, provide B-cell help, and develop effector responses in the periphery (161). These studies are consistent with a model of primary stimulation that includes two distinct phases of TCR engagement. The first phase involves programming the T-cell response and corresponds with the early hours of surface TCR downregulation. The second phase involves carrying out the response via effector function, during which time surface TCR upregulation could be important.

Effector cells with upregulated TCR levels might find their targets more efficiently, compete better with other T cells for APC interaction, and/or gain an increased susceptibility to TCR-dependent AICD (162). We found that activated T cells
(with upregulated surface TCR levels) and resting T-cells (with normal TCR levels) downregulated the same percentage of TCRs in response to anti-CD3 stimulation. To achieve this, the activated T cells actually downregulated more total TCRs than the cells with lower starting TCR levels (134). Thus, surface TCR upregulation apparently increases the quantitative signaling capacity of activated T cells. We also found that engagement of surface-replenishing TCRs can enhance the primary T-cell proliferative response (8). These observations demonstrate that surface-replenishing TCRs are functional, and their engagement induces signaling and contributes to effector responses. Although the magnitude of surface TCR replenishment is regulated by the strength of stimulus, it is still unknown whether varying the number of TCRs that replenish the membrane during prolonged stimulation actually affects the outcome of T-cell activation. Experiments using conditional TCR-expressing mutant mice could help clarify this point, by modulating surface TCR levels at various times of T-cell activation in a manner that is independent of antigenic signaling.

### Two proposed effects on T-cell antigen receptor expression that increase signaling capacity in activated T cells

#### Activation-induced surface TCR upregulation
T-cell activation can induce a quantitative enhancement in surface TCR expression level, which may elevate T-cell sensitivity to antigen, as T-cell activation progresses. It has been demonstrated that continued antigenic signaling during activation-induced surface TCR replenishment correlates with an augmentation in the naïve CD4⁺ T-cell proliferative response (8). In other settings, surface TCR upregulation represents a known mechanism of enhancing T-cell antigenic sensitivity (Table 1). It is now clear that it can occur as part of the normal T-cell activation process.

#### TCR avidity maturation
Surface TCRs have been reported to undergo an ‘avidity maturation’ following T-cell stimulation and acquisition of effector function (156, 163). This process may be dependent on cholesterol content and structural alterations in the plasma membrane induced by T-cell activation. Fahmy et al. (156) reported a 10–50-fold increase in the binding of peptide–MHC dimers to activated T cells compared with naïve T cells. Two treatments reduced the binding of peptide–MHC dimers to activated T cells: (i) prebinding of an anti-TCR Cβ Fab, which had no effect on the binding of peptide–MHC dimers to naïve T cells and (ii) cholesterol depletion of the plasma membrane. In contrast, addition of exogenous cholesterol to the membranes of naïve T cells enhanced their binding to peptide–MHC dimers. The authors concluded that membrane and possibly TCR stoichiometric alterations accounted for enhanced TCR avidity in activated T cells. Interestingly, Fahmy et al. (156) also noted that a twofold increase in surface TCR expression coincided with avidity maturation, a point which emphasizes that these processes can be viewed as complementary in timing and presumed function.

### Interpreting deviations in surface T-cell antigen receptor expression level
In light of these studies, can surface TCR expression level serve as a predictor of T-cell activation state? One might anticipate that T cells expressing unusually high levels of surface TCR do so, because they have been recently stimulated. The only known mechanisms for inducing surface TCR upregulation involve TCR, ceramide, or PP2A activities, and the latter two effects are normally downstream of TCR signaling in any event. Therefore, it seems likely that cells with high levels of surface TCR would represent stimulated cells.

On the other hand, T cells may be found to express low levels of surface TCR for diverse reasons. First, low surface TCR levels may be indicative of aberrant thymic development, as is the case for the few peripheral T cells found in Lck-deficient mice (164, 165). Second, some peripheral T cells express two TCR αβ species; such cells are likely to express a normal number of total surface TCRs but lower numbers of each αβ clonotype as a result (8, 35). Third, T cells may have recently undergone very strong antigenic stimulus but have not yet initiated surface TCR replenishment to a high degree. Fourth, cells may be currently experiencing strong antigenic signaling involving sustained TCR triggering and downregulation of surface-replenishing TCRs. Fifth, the cells may be distressed or dying. Therefore, low-level surface TCR expression by itself is not a predictive parameter of T-cell activation state or history.

### Concluding remarks
We have focused on surface TCR expression as the first limiting factor in the pathway of antigenic signaling in T cells, although realizing that the total number of mechanisms to fine-tune antigenic reactivity are likely to be plentiful (for other examples, see 166–170). The subunit building blocks of the surface TCR/CD3 complex have been well characterized, and yet, the possibility for new subunit constituencies and

Immunological Reviews 196/2003   19
relationships has emerged from recent studies. Meanwhile, the precise nature of the holomeric TCR/CD3 complex continues to elude clarification. In general, surface TCR expression level correlates with antigenic responsiveness when comparing T cells within a given maturation state. TCR level is regulated and dynamic, during both thymic and mature effector T-cell development (Fig. 3), and is probably important throughout these processes to control antigenic sensitivity. For mature T cells, all evidence points to a positive correlation between surface TCR expression level and antigenic signaling capacity. Surface TCR expression on effector T cells can be influenced by the dose and duration of antigenic stimulation and by costimulation provided during priming. Strong antigenic stimuli likely heighten the antigenic sensitivity of effector cells by means of inducing surface TCR upregulation and avidity maturation. Quiescent memory T cells do not express upregulated TCR levels, but they use other mechanisms to augment their antigenic signaling capacity. Ultimately, deciphering the relationship between surface TCR expression and long-term T-cell signaling capacity should be a clear goal during the next decade.
