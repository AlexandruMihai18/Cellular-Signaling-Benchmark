Abstract—Ca²⁺ ion is a universal intracellular messenger that regulates numerous biological functions. In smooth muscle, Ca²⁺ with calmodulin activates myosin light chain (MLC) kinase to initiate a rapid MLC phosphorylation and contraction. To test the hypothesis that regulation of MLC phosphatase is involved in the rapid development of MLC phosphorylation and contraction during Ca²⁺ transient, we compared Ca²⁺ signal, MLC phosphorylation, and 2 modes of inhibition of MLC phosphatase, phosphorylation of CPI-17 Thr38 and MYPT1 Thr853, during α₁ agonist-induced contraction with/without various inhibitors in intact rabbit femoral artery. Phenylephrine rapidly induced CPI-17 phosphorylation from a negligible amount to a peak value of 0.38±0.04 mol of Pi/mol within 7 seconds following stimulation, similar to the rapid time course of Ca²⁺ rise and MLC phosphorylation. This rapid CPI-17 phosphorylation was dramatically inhibited by either blocking Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum or by pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors, suggesting an involvement of Ca²⁺-dependent protein kinase C. This was followed by a slow Ca²⁺-independent and Rho-kinase/protein kinase C-dependent phosphorylation of CPI-17. In contrast, MYPT1 phosphorylation had only a slow component that increased from 0.29±0.09 at rest to the peak of 0.68±0.14 mol of Pi/mol at 1 minute, similar to the time course of contraction. Thus, there are 2 components of the Ca²⁺ sensitization through inhibition of MLC phosphatase. Our results support the hypothesis that the initial rapid Ca²⁺ rise induces a rapid inhibition of MLC phosphatase coincident with the Ca²⁺-induced MLC kinase activation to synergistically initiate a rapid MLC phosphorylation and contraction in arteries with abundant CPI-17 content.

A wide range of excitatory agonists including α₁-adrenergic agonist activates both heterotrimeric Gq and G₁₂/₁₃ G proteins in smooth muscle following their bindings to G protein-coupled receptors.¹ The former G protein further activates phospholipase Cβ to hydrolyze plasma membrane phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) and concurrently generates 2 signaling messengers: a water-soluble inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG). The former messenger diffuses to the cytoplasm and binds to the IP₃ receptor channel in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) membrane to induce Ca²⁺ release from the lumen. This Ca²⁺ triggers the rapid phasic component of contraction and myosin light chain (MLC) phosphorylation through activation of the Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent MLC kinase (MLCK). Although Ca²⁺ influx is subsequently increased through opening of surface membrane Ca²⁺ channels, [Ca²⁺]i is not kept constant but rather transient and/or oscillates during the agonist stimulation.² The average MLC phosphorylation is also transient; however, the tonic component of the phosphorylation after the peak is maintained at higher levels than expected from the Ca²⁺ signal, as compared with that of high K⁺ stimulation, suggesting an increase in the Ca²⁺ sensitivity of MLC phosphorylation via the inhibition of MLC phosphatase (MLCP).¹,² As a result, a relatively high level of MLC phosphorylation and contraction is achieved even at low MLCK activity under low [Ca²⁺]i during agonist-induced contraction.³ The inhibition of MLCP thus appears to play as critical a role as the Ca²⁺-dependent activation of MLCK in the maintenance of tonic contraction.

MLCP is a holoenzyme composed of 3 subunits: a 38-kDa catalytic subunit (δ isoform of type 1 protein phosphatase, PP1cδ), a large 110- to 130-kDa regulatory subunit (MYPT1), and a small 20-kDa subunit.⁴ MYPT1 is responsible for binding to and activation of PP1c and for targeting myosin. Two major signaling pathways have been proposed for the in situ inhibition of MLCP. One is the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 and Thr853 via G₁₂/₁₃/RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway.¹ Recently, Hartshorne and colleagues⁵ demonstrated these results, although conflicting with their previous finding⁶ that the phosphorylation at not only Thr696 but also Thr853 equally suppresses the phosphatase activity. Several other kinases such as integrin-linked kinase (ILK), zipper-interacting protein kinase (ZIPK), p21-activated kinase (PAK), and dystrophia myotonica protein kinase (DMPK)

can also phosphorylate the Thr696 site.¹ However, the in situ phosphorylation at Thr696 in smooth muscle tissues and cultured cells is only minimally increased on G protein activation and not decreased by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632, which can significantly suppress agonist-induced Ca²⁺ sensitization of contraction and MLC phosphorylation.⁷,⁸ On the other hand, Thr853 is a Rho-kinase–specific site, and, in fact, the in situ phosphorylation is significantly increased in response to agonist stimulation via Rho-kinase pathway in smooth muscle tissues and cultured cells.⁵,⁷

The second mechanism of MLCP inhibition is through phosphorylation of smooth muscle-specific MLCP inhibitor protein CPI-17.⁹ Although there are multiple sites to be phosphorylated, the phosphorylation at only Thr38 increases the inhibitory effect of CPI-17 on MLCP by 1000-fold.¹⁰ A major kinase for agonist-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation at Thr38 in smooth muscle tissues is protein kinase C (PKC),⁹,¹¹ which is activated by phospholipase Cβ generation of DAG. Therefore, a potential signaling pathway through CPI-17 phosphorylation toward inhibition of MLCP is Gq/phospholipase Cβ/DAG/PKC/CPI-17/MLCP. Another possible pathway is through Rho-kinase–induced phosphorylation of CPI-17. This is based on the evidence that the Rho-kinase inhibitor reduces agonist-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation.⁷,⁸,¹¹ Furthermore, overexpression of constitutively active RhoA in cultured arterial smooth muscle cells increases CPI-17 phosphorylation.¹² Thus, multiple signaling pathways mediate the agonist-induced inhibition of MLCP via the phosphorylation of MYPT1 and CPI-17. Furthermore, expression ratios of CPI-17 relative to MYPT1 (ie, MLCP) largely vary, depending on the type of smooth muscle.¹³ Thus, the Ca²⁺-sensitizing signal transduction through phosphorylation of MYPT1 and CPI-17 depends on the tissue type. However, the kinetics of 2 phosphorylations, CPI-17 at Thr38 and MYPT1 at Thr853, on agonist stimulation have not been investigated in detail.

We hypothesized that these 2 phosphorylations are activated in a specific time course on agonist stimulation. We therefore examined the temporal relationship among Ca²⁺, MLC phosphorylation, CPI-17 (Thr38) phosphorylation, MYPT1 (Thr853) phosphorylation, and contraction in response to the α₁ agonist phenylephrine (PE) in rabbit femoral artery tissues and, furthermore, determined the effects of Ca²⁺ blockers, PKC inhibitors, and Rho-kinase inhibitors on these parameters. We also determined the stoichiometric amount of the in situ phosphorylation of CPI-17 and MYPT1. Our results reveal that, in addition to known Ca²⁺-independent phosphorylation of CPI-17 and MYPT1, CPI-17 is Ca²⁺-dependently phosphorylated by PKC as rapidly as MLCs are phosphorylated. The source of Ca²⁺ for the rapid phosphorylation is agonist-induced Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) but not Ca²⁺ influx from the extracellular space.

### Time Course of PE-Induced Contraction and Phosphorylation of MLC, CPI-17, and MYPT1 in Rabbit Femoral Artery
Figure 1A illustrates an example of the simultaneous measurements of Fura-2 ratio signal and isometric contraction in response to 50 μmol/L PE, with a clear indication of the Ca²⁺ rise in advance of force development. During the prolonged stimulation with PE, the Ca²⁺ level was partially decreased to 42 ± 8% (n = 5) of the transient peak. Figure 1B confirms that the increase in MLC phosphorylation precedes the development of contraction.¹⁶ At 7 seconds, MLC was already phosphorylated to 90% of the peak level (0.63 ± 0.04 mol of Pi/mol of MLC at 15 seconds; n = 6), whereas the force at the 7-second time point was developed to only 30% of the peak level at 5 minutes.

Figure 1C and 1D illustrates a representative immunoblotting image and average extent of phosphorylated CPI-17 at Thr38 or MYPT1 at Thr853 in the PE-stimulated arterial tissues at various time points. CPI-17 was rapidly phosphorylated from a negligible value at rest (0 second in C and D) to a peak at 7 seconds similar to the rate of MLC phosphorylation but much faster than MYPT1 Thr853 phosphorylation and force development. The stoichiometry of CPI-17 phosphorylation was <0.01 ± 0.00 (n = 13) at rest and 0.38 ± 0.04 mol of Pi/mol (n = 4) of CPI-17 at 7 seconds after PE stimulation. In contrast, MYPT1 Thr853 at resting state was already phosphorylated to a considerable level (43 ± 7% of value at 60 seconds). The phosphorylation was slowly increased similar to the rate at which the contractile force was developed (Figure 1B and 1D). In contrast to MYPT1 Thr853, the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696 was detected at rest and was not significantly increased at 60 seconds (not shown), confirming the previous results.⁸ The stoichiometry of MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr853 was estimated as 0.29 ± 0.09 mol of Pi/mol (n = 13) of MYPT1 at rest and reached 0.68 ± 0.14 mol/mol (n = 4) at 60 seconds after PE stimulation. Assuming that the protein content of the typical mammalian cell is 18% of the total cell weight, the total MYPT1 concentration, ie, MLCP

concentration, was 0.8±0.1 μmol/L (n=6) in rabbit femoral artery. Total expression level of CPI-17 in rabbit femoral artery is previously estimated 6±1 μmol/L¹³; thereby the cellular concentration of phosphorylated CPI-17 is increased to 2.3±0.2 μmol/L at 7 seconds.

After 15 seconds of PE stimulation, on the other hand, phosphorylation levels of MLC began to significantly but partially decline from 0.63±0.04 (n=6) to 0.47±0.03 mol of Pi/mol of MLC (n=4) at 60 seconds and then to 0.44±0.05 mol/mol (n=4) at 5 minutes. The phosphorylation level at 5 minutes was still much higher than that at rest, whereas average contraction level was maintained up to 5 minutes (Figure 1B) and thereafter started to decline during PE stimulation in many cases. The phosphorylated CPI-17 level also tended to decline slightly but not significantly to 1.7±0.18 μmol/L (n=5) at 5 minutes (Figure 1D), whereas MYPT1 phosphorylation level was not decreased and was maintained up to 5 minutes (Figure 1D; 0.67±0.07 mol/mol; n=7).

Effect of Inhibition of Ca²⁺ Rise on PE-Induced Phosphorylation and Contraction

A mixture of 2 Ca²⁺ blockers (2 μmol/L ryanodine,¹⁷ to open-lock the SR Ca²⁺ release channel plus 1 μmol/L nicardipine,¹⁸ to inhibit the voltage-dependent L-type Ca²⁺ channel) was applied to eliminate the [Ca²⁺]i increase by PE (Figure 2). The blocking of both the SR Ca²⁺ release and the

voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ influx totally abolished an increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ in response to PE (Figure 2A). The lack of PE-induced Ca²⁺ increase strongly inhibited the initial fast-rising phase and also the sustained phase of PE-induced contraction (Figure 2B), and MLC phosphorylation at 7 and 15 second-time points (Figure 2C). However, these Ca²⁺ blockers had no significant effect on MLC phosphorylation at 5 minutes after PE stimulation (Figure 2C) and did not prevent the slow development of contraction (Figure 2B). The basal levels of Ca²⁺ was slightly elevated possibly because of the leakage of Ca²⁺ through the ryanodine receptors¹⁷ or an increase in the Ca²⁺ influx by the depletion of Ca²⁺ stores.¹⁹ This may cause a slight increase in the resting MLC phosphorylation (0 second in Figure 2C) and force (not shown). The inhibition of the Ca²⁺ rise almost abolished the rapid increase in PE-induced phosphorylation of CPI-17 at 7 seconds (Figure 2D), whereas the phosphorylation was thereafter significantly increased at 15 seconds and 5 minutes by 0.39±0.13 and 0.41±0.08 μmol/L, respectively. In contrast, the MYPT1 phosphorylation in the presence of Ca²⁺ blockers increased similar to the control in the absence (Figure 2E).

To further evaluate the effects of Ca²⁺ blockers on the initial rapid rising and sustained phases of PE-induced contraction, arterial strips were subjected to an individual blocker, nicardipine or ryanodine alone (Figure 3). Pretreatment with 1 μmol/L nicardipine for 10 minutes primarily inhibited the

Open and hatched bars represent phosphorylation in the absence and presence of inhibitors, respectively. *Significant difference from control under the same time point.

sustained but not initial rapid phase of PE-induced contraction (Figure 3A). Longer treatment with the Ca²⁺ entry blocker for 30 to 40 minutes caused a gradual suppression of both initial and sustained phases of contraction (not shown), possibly because of a depletion of the SR of Ca²⁺. Ryanodine, in contrast, suppressed the initial rapid-rising phase of PE-induced contraction but had no effect on the sustained phase of the contraction (Figure 3A). The ryanodine treatment diminished the phasic component of Ca²⁺ rise in response to PE, but the sustained phase of Ca²⁺ was higher than the control without the treatment (the red trace compared with the black in Figure 3B). The phosphorylation of CPI-17 in response to PE at 7 seconds was completely prevented by the ryanodine treatment (0±0% in Figure 3D) but partially increased at 15 seconds (25±8% for ryanodine treatment versus 122±12% for control; n=3). At 5 minutes, CPI-17 became phosphorylated to 58±18% (n=3; Figure 3E), which was not significantly different from the control at 5 minutes. The value was significantly higher than that of the channel blocker combination (Figure 3D). The ryanodine treatment had no significant effect on the PE-induced MYPT1 phosphorylation at 7 seconds and 5 minutes (Figure 3F and 3G). Furthermore, we tested the effects of another 2 Ca²⁺ blockers on contraction: thapsigargin, an inhibitor for the SR Ca²⁺ ATPase,²⁰ and 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), an IP₃ receptor antagonist.

We confirmed that treatment with 10 μmol/L thapsigargin but not with 30 μmol/L 2-APB strongly suppressed 20 mmol/L caffeine-induced transient contraction in the absence of Ca²⁺. Both thapsigargin and 2-APB, like ryanodine, delayed the initial onset of PE-induced contraction (not shown), whereas the latter compound, in contrast to ryanodine and thapsigargin, strongly suppressed the sustained tonic level of the contraction to 24±2% (n=4) of control.

The high K⁺-induced membrane depolarization of smooth muscle tissues is known to rapidly increase [Ca²⁺]i through direct opening of the voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels, MLC phosphorylation, and a contraction.¹⁵,¹⁶ We examined the effect of high (124 mmol/L) K⁺ on the Ca²⁺ signal and CPI-17 and MYPT1 phosphorylation in the ryanodine-treated strips. Both initial and maintained levels of Ca²⁺ rise were higher during the high K⁺ stimulation than that of PE in rabbit femoral artery (Figure 3C). The high K⁺ stimulation of the untreated strips, although producing a rapid increase in contraction, did not have a significant effect on phosphorylation of CPI-17 nor MYPT1 at 7 seconds, as compared with the respective resting value (Figure 3D and 3F). Five minutes of stimulation with high K⁺, however, significantly elevated MYPT1 phosphorylation (Figure 3G), whereas CPI-17 phosphorylation was still not significantly increased (Figure 3E). Simultaneous stimulation with high K⁺

1 μmol/L also significantly inhibited PE-induced CPI-17 phosphorylation to 21±1% (n=3) at 7 seconds, but less effective than 3 μmol/L GF-109203X. In contrast, the MYPT1 phosphorylation was not significantly decreased by either GF-109203X (Figure 4G) or calphostin C (62±10% at 7 seconds and 118±6% at 5 minutes; n=3).

### Effects of PKC Inhibitors on PE-Induced Phosphorylation and Contraction

Three modes of PKC inhibitors, GF-109203X (binding to the catalytic domain of both conventional and novel PKCs),²² calphostin C (binding to the regulatory domain of both conventional and novel PKCs),²³ and Gö6976 (binding to the catalytic domain of conventional PKC)²² were used to examine the role of PKC in the PE-induced contraction. GF-109203X at 3 μmol/L significantly, but slightly, decreased the rate of initial rise in [Ca²⁺]i by PE (Figure 4A) but did not reduce the sustained level of [Ca²⁺]i. The GF compound also inhibited both the initial rising phase and the sustained phase of the PE-induced contraction, with a small delay in the onset (Figure 4C). The delay was much shorter than that caused by the Ca²⁺ channel blocker combination (Figure 4C versus Figure 2B). Calphostin C (1 μmol/L) had a similar inhibitory effect on both initial rising and sustained phases of PE-induced contraction (Figure 4D), but without obvious delay in the Ca²⁺ signals (Figure 4B). Gö6976 (10 μmol/L) had a similar inhibitory effect on the initial rising phase but less effect on the sustained level of the contraction, as compared with those of conventional PKC (cPKC)/novel PKC (nPKC) inhibitors (Figure 4E). GF-109203X significantly inhibited the PE-induced increase in MLC phosphorylation at all 3 time points but had no effect at rest (hatched bar at 0 second in Figure 4E). The CPI-17 phosphorylation at 7 seconds after stimulation with PE was almost completely blocked by the presence of GF-109203X, and thereafter slightly increased at 15 seconds and 5 minutes (Figure 4F) similar to the effect of the Ca²⁺ blocker combination (Figure 4D). Calphostin C at

### Effects of Rho-Kinase Inhibitors on PE-Induced Phosphorylation and Contraction

We examined the effect of Rho-kinase inhibitors (Y-27632²⁴ and H-1152²⁵) on PE-induced contraction and phosphorylation. Y-27632 (10 μmol/L) had a slight inhibitory effect on the initial rising phase of [Ca²⁺]i increase by 50 μmol/L PE but not in the sustained phase (Figure 5A), similar to the effect of GF-109203X. Both Y-27632 and H-1152 (3 μmol/L) inhibited the sustained phase of PE-induced contraction, whereas the inhibitors (even 30 μmol/L Y-27632) had almost no effect on the initial rising phase of contraction (Figure 5B and 5C). The effect of the 3 types of inhibitors (Ca²⁺ blockers, GF-109203X, and Y-27632) on PE-induced contraction were additive in any combination of 2, and the pretreatment with all 3 types of inhibitors totally abolished the development of PE-induced contraction (not shown).

Y-27632 (10 μmol/L) had no significant effect on phosphorylation of MLC and CPI-17 by the 7-second time point after 50 μmol/L PE stimulation, and, thereafter, phosphorylation of both proteins were significantly but partially inhibited (Figure 5D and 5E). H-1152 (3 μmol/L) also significantly reduced CPI-17 phosphorylation to a level similar to Y-27632 (n=3; 30±5% versus 42±7% in Y-27632) at 5 minutes. The MYPT1 phosphorylation at every time point, including rest, was almost abolished by Y-27632 (Figure 5F). H-1152 had a similar inhibitory effect on MYPT1 phosphorylation at 5 minutes (n=3; 12±2% versus 15±3% in Y-27632).

## Discussion

This study demonstrates unique roles of the phosphorylation of CPI-17 at Thr38 and MYPT1 at Thr853, respectively, in PE-induced contraction of artery. The rapid phosphorylation of CPI-17 in physiological conditions is totally reliant on Ca²⁺ release from the SR and on Ca²⁺-dependent PKC activity, and concomitant with a rapid rise in Ca²⁺ and an initial rapid development of MLC phosphorylation. On the other hand, the Ca²⁺-independent phosphorylation of both CPI-17 and MYPT1 by Rho-kinase occurs in the following sustained phase, in parallel with a force generation. These results indicate the existence of 2 distinct Ca²⁺-sensitizing signal transduction pathways, leading to inhibition of MLCP: rapid and slow mechanisms mainly driven by PKC and Rho-kinase, respectively (Figure 6). We propose a hypothesis that the rapid-signaling messenger Ca²⁺ synchronously increases and decreases MLCK and MLCP, respectively, toward the same target protein to synergistically increase a rapid phosphorylation of MLC and to initiate a rapid development of contraction in artery (left side of signal transduction pathways in Figure 6).

### Mechanism for Rapid Agonist-Induced Ca²⁺ Sensitization

The initial rapid phosphorylation of CPI-17 was Ca²⁺ dependent. Treatment of arterial smooth muscle with ryanodine in the presence of caffeine (see the expanded Materials and Methods section in the online data supplement) depleted the SR of Ca²⁺, and thus abolished the transient component of Ca²⁺ increase and the initial rapid but not slow increase in phosphorylation of CPI-17 and contraction in response to PE (Figure 3). Total inhibition of Ca²⁺ rise in response to PE with the mixture of ryanodine and nicardipine abolished the initial rapid and also inhibited the sustained slow components of CPI-17 phosphorylation (Figure 2). Together, these results suggest that the SR Ca²⁺ release is responsible for the initial rapid phase of CPI-17 phosphorylation and contraction, and the voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ influx plays a crucial role in the late sustained phase (Figure 6). The membrane depolarization by high K⁺ evokes Ca²⁺ rise, MLC phosphorylation, and smooth muscle contraction, whereas the Ca²⁺ rise did not trigger the CPI-17 phosphorylation, even though the [Ca²⁺]i level during high K⁺-induced contraction was higher than that of PE (Figure 3). In fact, increase in the [Ca²⁺]i to 1 μmol/L

using the Ca²⁺/EGTA buffer in α toxin-permeabilized strips did not significantly increase CPI-17 phosphorylation.¹¹ These results, together, suggest that Ca²⁺ is required but not sufficient for triggering CPI-17 phosphorylation. The rapid CPI-17 phosphorylation by PE was also eliminated by a PKC inhibitor, either GF-109203X or calphostin C, but not by the Rho-kinase inhibitor Y-27632 (Figure 4G versus Figure 5E). These results, in conjunction with the fact that both PKCa and PKCB but not PKCy are expressed as major Ca²⁺-dependent PKC isoforms in rabbit femoral artery (G. Dimopoulos, T. Kitazawa, unpublished results, 2005), suggest that both IP₃-induced SR Ca²⁺ release and DAG-induced activation of Ca²⁺-dependent PKCa and/or -β isoforms are required for the CPI-17 phosphorylation (Figure 6). Removal of rapid CPI-17 phosphorylation by ryanodine treatment (Figure 3D) raises a possibility that Ca²⁺ release from the SR is specific for the rapid activation of PKC and thus the CPI-17 phosphorylation. However, even after destruction of the SR Ca²⁺ release by ryanodine treatment, PE with Ca²⁺ influx by high K⁺ was able to induce a rapid phosphorylation of CPI-17 to a level equivalent to control without ryanodine treatment (Figure 3D and 3E). We presume that, under the physiological conditions, PE-induced Ca²⁺ release but not Ca²⁺ influx is the mediator for the rapid CPI-17 phosphorylation, possibly because of coordinated timing between Ca²⁺ release and DAG production. The Ca²⁺ influx induced by PE appears to be too slow for activation of Ca²⁺-dependent cPKC (Figure 3B). This Ca²⁺-dependent phosphorylation of CPI-17, together with the activation of MLCK, initiates a rapid increase in MLC phosphorylation and contraction before the slow

RhoA/Rho-kinase signaling pathway (Figure 6). Recently, we have demonstrated that chicken smooth muscle tissues lack both CPI-17 expression and 4-β-phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate (PDBu)-induced contraction, unlike pigeon or other mammals.²⁶ We found that the rise of PE-induced contraction in CPI-17-deficient chicken mesenteric artery was much slower than those of CPI-17-rich rabbit and pigeon arteries (also see Kitazawa et al²⁶). These data support the hypothesis that CPI-17 is necessary for the rapid contraction induced on agonist stimulation in artery.

### Rapid Phosphorylation of CPI-17 and Classical Ca²⁺ Sensitization

In α toxin-permeabilized smooth muscle, PDBu, GTPγS, and histamine rather slowly increase phosphorylation of CPI-17 and MLC, as well as contraction at resting or near resting Ca²⁺.¹,⁷,⁸,¹⁴ The steady-state CPI-17 phosphorylation in permeabilized tissues is more strongly inhibited by GF-109203X than Gö6976 or Y-27632, suggesting that a major kinase is Ca²⁺-independent nPKC.⁹ In contrast, this study clearly shows that Ca²⁺ increase has a crucial role in the rapid phosphorylation of CPI-17 by Ca²⁺-dependent cPKC in intact tissues (Figures 3 and 6). This rapid Ca²⁺-dependent CPI-17 phosphorylation cannot be seen in permeabilized smooth muscle tissues, where the SR is depleted of Ca²⁺ and/or Ca²⁺ is clamped with a high Ca²⁺/EGTA buffer. Any treatments modulating the Ca²⁺ release and/or Ca²⁺ loading of SR must affect the rapid CPI-17 phosphorylation and, thus, the rapid Ca²⁺ sensitization of contraction in intact smooth muscle.

The Ca²⁺-dependent translocation of PKCa isoform from the cytosol to the cell surface has been shown in response to

PE in smooth muscle cells isolated from ferret portal vein.²⁷ If the translocation of Ca²⁺-dependent PKC is required for the enzymatic activation, CPI-17 should be translocated to the surface membrane. However, the PKC translocation appears a slow process with a half-time of approximately 3 minutes and dependent on a steady-state Ca²⁺ level but not on an initial large transient of Ca²⁺,²⁷ suggesting that the phosphorylation of CPI-17 occurs in advance of the translocation of PKCa. The issue, however, should be reevaluated in the fresh smooth muscle tissues or cells under conditions in which CPI-17 is rapidly phosphorylated by PKC in response to agonists.

### Mechanisms for Slow Phase of Ca²⁺ Sensitization

The sustained tonic level of PE-induced contraction was more strongly inhibited by GF-109203X and calphostin C than Gö6976 (Figure 4E), indicating that Ca²⁺-independent nPKC takes the place of Ca²⁺-dependent cPKC in terms of CPI-17 phosphorylation with time. Phosphorylation of CPI-17 at the slow and sustained phase also contains a small but significant component insensitive to the Ca²⁺ blockers and PKC inhibitors, as compared with that of the initial phase (Figures 2D and 4G), suggesting that Ca²⁺-independent protein kinase(s) rather than PKC is involved in the slow phosphorylation of CPI-17 and the sustained tonic component of contraction. Furthermore, the MLC phosphorylation in the sustained tonic phase of contraction was also insensitive to the Ca²⁺ blockers

or PKC inhibitors, compared with that of the initial phase (Figures 2C and 4F), suggesting that a mechanism(s) other than Ca²⁺-dependent PKC/CPI-17 phosphorylation is slowly developed at the late phase.

MYPT1 phosphorylation at Thr853 in response to either PE or high K⁺ is rather slowly augmented (Figures 1C and 3G) compared with the rapid phosphorylation of MLC and CPI-17. Both Y-27632 and H-1152 almost completely abolished this MYPT1 phosphorylation, whereas they did not attenuate the early phase of phosphorylation of MLC and CPI-17 and contraction (Figure 5). Therefore, the regulation of MLCP activity through Rho-kinase is involved in rather late sustained phase but not the early phase of PE-induced MLC phosphorylation and contraction. This is consistent with the observation that noradrenalin stimulation induces a slow increase in the amount of active GTP-bound form of RhoA in aorta²⁸ and that photolysis of caged GTP-G14V RhoA/GDI complex in permeabilized portal vein induces a slow onset of contraction,¹ similar to the time course of the MYPT1 Thr853 phosphorylation (Figure 1). On the other hand, when both Ca²⁺ release and Ca²⁺ influx were blocked with Ca²⁺ blockers, MLC phosphorylation and contraction were still significantly and slowly increased under the conditions in which MLCK was supposedly not increased (Figure 2). This contraction was partially inhibited by either GF-109203X or Y-27632 and completely inhibited by a mixture of 2 inhibitors (not shown). These results suggest that this slow development of MLC phosphorylation indicates a slow inhibi-

tion of MLCP in intact artery via 3 possible Ca²⁺-independent mechanisms: nPKC/CPI-17, Rho-kinase/CPI-17, and Rho-kinase/MYPT1 (Figure 6).

In conclusion, α₁ agonist triggers the Ca²⁺ release from the SR to induce a rapid and Ca²⁺-dependent phosphorylation of the MLCP inhibitor protein CPI-17 in artery. This can lead to a dual regulation of MLC phosphorylation in a synchronous way (Figure 6): a downregulation of phosphatase in coordination with the upregulation of Ca²⁺-dependent kinase to synergistically increase a phosphorylation of the same target protein MLC and a large contraction with a small increase in Ca²⁺. The expression level of CPI-17, however, greatly varies with smooth muscle tissue types¹³; therefore, this rapid CPI-17 signaling appears to be vital in vascular smooth muscles, although insignificant in visceral phasic smooth muscles.

# Methods

## Tissue preparation and force measurement

The femoral arteries were dissected from New Zealand white male rabbits (2-3 kg in weight). The arterial strips 60-70 μm thick, 0.75-1 mm wide and 2.5-3 mm long were cut and carefully freed from connective tissue. The endothelium was removed by rubbing with a razor blade. The strips were then tied with silk monofilament to the fine tips of two tungsten needles, one of which was connected to a force transducer (AM801, SensoNor, Horten, Norway) and the other to a micromanipulator to adjust the muscle length. The strips were mounted in a well on the Bubble chamber plate to allow either rapid solution exchange or quick-freezing by plunging the strips in liquid nitrogen-cooled propane (-150°C) as described previously in details.¹² Prior to experimentation, the strips were repeatedly stimulated for 5 minutes with high K⁺ (124 mM) solution and later with 50 μM phenylephrine with 15 minute-interval at 30°C several times until each steady maximum response was maintained for at least 5 minutes. The force transducer output was digitized using PowerLab/8SP (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO). All experiments for intact tissues were carried out at 30°C.

For depletion of the SR of $Ca^{2+}$, the strips were incubated in the solution containing 2 μM ryanodine (a $Ca^{2+}$-induced $Ca^{2+}$ release channel opener; BioMol, Plymouth Meeting, PA) and 20 mM caffeine for 15 minutes and washed with the solution without caffeine for another 15 minutes. Thereafter, IP₃ (in permeabilized tissues), caffeine and agonists no longer evoked $Ca^{2+}$ transient and transient contractions in the absence of extracellular $Ca^{2+}$.³ The strips were then stimulated with PE in the presence of ryanodine.

Online Supplement                                                                 Dimopoulos et al.  S2

$Ca^{2+}$-Dependent $Ca^{2+}$ Sensitization

For blocking the $Ca^{2+}$ influx, the strips were incubated in the solution containing 1 μM nicardipine for 10 minutes after 10-minute rest and stimulated with PE in the presence of the drug. After treatment, high K⁺ did not evoke a significant contraction.

For blocking both $Ca^{2+}$ release and $Ca^{2+}$ entry, the strips were first treated with ryanodine as described above, and, after removal of caffeine, were incubated in the solution containing both ryanodine and nicardipine for 15 minutes followed by the PE stimulation.

For inhibiting PKC activity, the strips were incubated in the external solution containing 3 μM GF-10203X (Biomol) or 1 μM calphostin C (Biomol and Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences) for 15 minutes before and during PE stimulation. In case of calphostin C, the strips were illuminated by a spotlight from 5 minutes before and during PE stimulation.⁴

For inhibiting Rho-kinase activity, the strips were incubated in the external solution containing 10 μM Y-27632 (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences) or 3 μM H-1152 (Calbiochem/EMD Biosciences) for 15 minutes before and during PE stimulation.

When CPI-17 was substrate, calphostin C at 1 μM did not inhibit recombinant ROCK while H-1152 at 10 μM did not inhibit brain PKC activity

Composition of the external solutions.

The compositions of external solutions for intact smooth muscle strips were prepared as described previously.¹² Normal external solution for intact smooth muscle strips was 150 mM NaCl, 4 mM KCl, 2 mM calcium methanesulphonate (Ca-Ms), 2 mM magnesium methanesulphonate, 5.6 mM glucose, and 5 mM N-2-hydroxyethylpiperazine-N'-2-ethanesulfonic acid. Depolarizing external solution had 124 mM potassium methanesulphonate (K-Ms) substituted equally for NaCl with other

chemicals in the same concentrations. Both solutions were neutralized by Tris to a pH of 7.4.

### Cytoplasmic $Ca^{2+}$ measurements:

Method for intracellular $Ca^{2+}$ measurement was essentially similar to that of Himpeins et al.⁵ Arterial strips that had been completed in their conditionings were incubated in the external solution containing 10 μM fura-2 AM, 0.5% DMSO and 0.01% Pluronic F127 (Molecular Probes) for 4 h at room temperature. After loading, strips were washed in the fresh external solution. Simultaneous measurements of isometric force and fura-2 fluorescence of the strips were carried out with the Muscle Research System (SI GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany).⁶ The fluorescence intensity of fura-2 through a bandpass filter of 510 nm was collected into a photomultiplier tube for alternating excitations at 340 and 380 nm using a rotating wheel, in which the fluorescence excitation filter was changed every 2 milliseconds. The fluorescence signal for each excitation light and the ratio signal (F340/F380) were digitized using PowerLab/8SP (ADInstruments, Colorado Springs, CO) and displayed in a computer. The F340/F380 ratio signal was simply used as a relative [Ca²⁺]i signal because the dissociation constant of fura-2 for Ca²⁺ in cytoplasm is not the same as that in test tube.⁷ Each end of the fura-2-loaded strip was fixed in a glass tube with two micro-tweezers, one of which was connected to a force transducer and the other to a micromanipulator to adjust the muscle length. The solutions in the tube were kept at 30°C. Since the solution exchange was made using a peristaltic pump, the change was not as rapid as that in the Bubble chamber system. We observed a little slower time course of development of [Ca²⁺]i and force induced by agonists or high K⁺ in this system even at the fast perfusion speed than those in the bubble chamber, and therefore the time course of Ca²⁺ signal

could not be accurately compared with that of force and MLC phosphorylation obtained using the Bubble chamber system.

# Measurement of MLC phosphorylation

In-situ phosphorylation of MLC in muscle strips was measured using the two-dimensional electrophoresis as described previously.¹,² Briefly, strips were quickly frozen in liquid-cooled propane (-150°C) at rest or during contraction, and then placed on top of frozen acetone containing 10% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and kept at –80°C overnight. Then the TCA/acetone solution was gradually warmed to room temperature. The strips were washed with acetone several times to remove TCA and then dried. Dried strips were homogenized in a glycerol sample buffer containing 0.1% SDS, 20 mM DTT, 10% glycerol, and 0.1 mg ml⁻¹ BSA and centrifuged. The supernatants were subjected to the two-dimensional electrophoresis.¹ The isoelectric focusing tube gel with 5% pH ampholytes 4.5/5.4 (Pharmalyte, Pharmacia Biotech) was run overnight until a constant current was reached. Then, an appropriate portion of gel was grafted horizontally onto the top of a SDS-polyacrylamide slab gel and the second dimensional gel was run. The proteins were transferred from the polyacrylamide gels to nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were then extensively washed in the phosphate-buffered saline solution overnight at room temperature. The membranes were subsequently rinsed with deionized H₂O and then stained with colloidal gold (Biorad). The colloidal gold-stained patterns of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated MLCs were identified according to the tropomyosin position, scanned and analyzed with an image processing software (Signal Analytics Co., Vienna, VA). For evaluation of phosphorylation values, the equation used was percent phosphorylation = 100 x (P1+P2)(U+P1+P2)⁻¹ where U = unphosphorylated, P1 = monophosphorylated, and P2 =

diphosphorylated MLC. The value was equivalent to a percentile of value in a unit of moles of Pi per mole of MLC.

## Antibodies and recombinant proteins

The antibodies used and Western blotting experiments were essentially similar to that of Kitazawa et al. ${}^{8,9}$ Human recombinant MYPT1 was kindly provided by Drs. K. Mabuchi and T. Tao (Boston Biomedical Research Institute). A N-terminal, His-tagged, fusion protein corresponding to amino acids 1-543 of rat Rho-kinase was from Upstate Biotechnology (Waltham, MA). Phosphorylation of the MYPT1 was carried out at $30^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ for different durations of time in $50 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaCl}, 20 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl (pH 7), $5 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Mg}$ methanesulphonate, $1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{EGTA}, 0.1 \mathrm{mM}$ dithiothreitol, $100 \mu \mathrm{g} / \mathrm{ml}$ MYPT1, 0.5 units Rho-kinase, and $0.1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{ATP}$. Anti-CPI-17 IgY antibody was raised in chicken eggs using His6-tagged porcine recombinant CPI-17 and purified using Affigel-10 resin conjugated with untagged CPI-17. Anti-phospho[Thr38]-CPI-17 (anti-p[Thr38]) antibody was raised in rabbit using the CPI-17 phosphopeptide ARV(phospho-T)VKYDRREL (corresponding to the sequence of amino acids 35-46 of porcine CPI-17) and purified using Affigel-10 resin conjugated with thiophosphorylated CPI-17. Rabbit anti-MYPT1 antibody was from BabCO (Richmond, CA). Anti-phospho[Thr696]-MYPT1 antibody (anti-p[Thr696]) was raised in rabbit using the MYPT1 Thr696 phosphopeptide CQSRRS(phospho-T)QGVTL (corresponding to the sequence of amino acids 691-701 of human MYPT1 with an additional cysteine at the N-terminus). Antibodies were absorbed from the antiserum onto unphosphorylated peptide conjugated to resin, prior to affinity purification of the phospho-specific antibody using a phospho-peptide resin. Polyclonal anti-phospho[Thr853]-MYPT1 antibody (anti-p[Thr853]) against a MYPT1 Thr853 phosphopeptide EKRRS(phospho-T)GVSFW (corresponding to amino acid

residues 848-858 of human MYPT1) was obtained from Upstate Biotechnology.

Secondary antibodies against chicken were from Promega (Madison, WI). Anti-mouse secondary antibodies were from Sigma and anti-rabbit secondary antibodies from Chemicon (Temecula, CA).

## Antibody specificity

The specificity of the rabbit antibody for phosphorylated Thr38 of CPI-17 has been demonstrated previously.⁸ We determined the specificity of the MYPT1 anti-p[Thr696]- and p[Thr853] antibodies to Rho-kinase-phosphorylated MYPT1. The dot blot analyses showed using various MYPT1 peptides that the anti-p[Thr696]-antibody reacted with MYPT1 Thr696 phosphopeptide but not unphosphorylated peptide with the same amino acid sequence or MYPT1 Thr853 phosphopeptide with the different sequence. As shown in the Supplemental Figure 1A, Western blotting with the BabCo anti-MYPT1 antibody showed equal reactivity toward the unphosphorylated and Rho-kinase-phosphorylated forms of recombinant MYPT1 (n=4). In contrast, the anti-p[Thr696] antibody reacted with only phosphorylated but not unphosphorylated recombinant MYPT1 (Figure 1B) while the Upstate anti-p[Thr853] antibody weakly responded to unphosphorylated MYPT1 (Figure 1C), however the interaction was only 5.7 ± 0.1% (n=9) of the response seen with the phosphorylated protein. Both phospho-specific antibodies offered a near-linear response to Rho-kinase-phosphorylated recombinant MYPT1. Using a SDS extract from PV smooth muscle tissues stimulated with 30 μM phenylephrine and 1 μM endothelin-1 for 5 minutes, the linearity of the antibody response was examined in the range of protein concentrations used in this study. There were no significant differences in Western blot linearity between the three antibodies (n=4; Figure 2). The MYPT1 blots of either the Rho-kinase-phosphorylated

Online Supplement                                                                 Dimopoulos et al.  S7

$Ca^{2+}$-Dependent $Ca^{2+}$ Sensitization

recombinant protein or agonist-stimulated PV extracts by the anti-p[Thr696] antibody were erased by the presence of 1 μM phosphorylated Thr696 peptide, indicating that this antibody is specific to the phosphorylation of MYPT1 at Thr696. We have demonstrated in the previous paper, however, that the in-situ Thr696 phosphorylation in rabbit femoral artery, portal vein, vas deferens and urinary bladder is not significantly increased in response to either agonists or GTPγS and not decreased by Rho-kinase inhibitor. In contrast, Thr853 phosphorylation is dynamically effected by agonists and inhibitors. Together, these results suggest that each of two phospho-specific MYPT1 antibodies recognizes the own specific phosphorylated site of the same protein.

Western blotting

Intact smooth muscle strips were rapidly frozen, acid-fixed at –80°C, washed with acetone and air-dried as described above. The dried strips were homogenized with a glass-glass mini-homogenizer in the Laemmli sample buffer containing 62.5 mM Tris, 1% SDS, 15% glycerol, 30 mM DTT, 100 μM 4-(2-Aminoethyl)-benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF, Pefabloc SC™; Roche, Indianapolis, IN), 10 μM N-[N-(L-3-Trans-carboxirane-2-carbonyl)-L-leucyl]-agmatine (E-64™, Roche) and 0.005% bromophenol blue (pH 6.8). To examine the phosphorylation level of both CPI-17 and MYPT1 in the same sample, Western blotting experiments were always carried out in duplicate. Equal amounts of each extract were loaded onto two identical polyacrylamide gradient (4–20%) gels, with a stacking gel on top. Separated proteins were transferred to the same nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were blocked in a Tris-buffered saline solution containing 0.05% Tween-20, 5% nonfat milk, and 1% bovine serum albumin. The membranes were then incubated with a primary antibody followed by an alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibody. The immunoblots were developed with an alkaline phosphatase substrate solution (Sigma) to visualize immunoreactive proteins.

$Ca^{2+}$-Dependent $Ca^{2+}$ Sensitization

The bands of alkaline phosphatase products were digitized and analyzed as previously described. We compared the ratios of phosphorylated CPI-17 and MYPT1 to the total amount of CPI-17 and MYPT1, respectively, in the paired set of Western blots as described previously.

To estimate the stoichiometric amounts of total and phosphorylated CPI-17 and MYPT1, the SDS-extracts of rabbit femoral artery stimulated with PE for 1 minute were probed along with various concentrations of phosphorylated recombinant CPI-17 (n=9) and MYPY1 (Supplemental Fig. 3; n=4), respectively, on the assumption that the protein content of the typical mammalian cell is 18% of total cell weight and the molecular weight of CPI-17 and MYPT1 is 17,000 and 115,000 kDa, respectively.

Supplemental Figure 1: Calibration curves of immunoblotting of unphosphorylated (blue) and Rho-kinase-phosphorylated MYPT1 (red) using anti-MYPT1, anti-p[Thr696], and anti-p[Thr853] antibodies. Various concentrations of unphosphorylated and phosphorylated recombinant MYPT1 were applied on 8% polyacrylamide gels. The Western blotting was carried out as described in the Online Data Supplement.

Supplemental Figure 2: Linearity of Western blotting of tissue extracts with anti-MYPT1 (blue), anti-p[Thr696] (red) and anti-p[Thr853]MYPT1 (green) antibodies. Proteins were extracted from agonist-stimulated rabbit portal vein, separated in the 8% gels, transferred to the membrane and blotted as described in the Online Data Supplement.

Supplemental Figure 3: Representative Western blot images for total (A) and phosphorylated MYPT1 (B) in the tissue extracts (20 μg of total proteins) of rabbit femoral artery stimulated with 50 μM PE for 1 minute with or without 3 μM GF-109203X, 10 μM Y-27632 or Ca²⁺-blockers (2 μM ryanodine + 1 μM nicardipine) along with 3, 7, 12 and 20 ng of recombinant MYPT1 (p-rMYPT1) phosphorylated by active Rho-kinase.
