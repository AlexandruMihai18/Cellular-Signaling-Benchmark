## ABSTRACT

Synaptic inhibition plays a key role in regulating neuronal excitability and information processing in the brain. The strength of synaptic inhibition is therefore an important determinant of both cellular and network activity levels in the central nervous system (CNS). γ-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA<sub>A</sub>) receptors are the major sites for fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS and alterations in their trafficking, synaptic accumulation and function play a key role in regulating neuronal excitability. Synaptic receptor number is determined by the trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to and away from inhibitory synapses and by their stability and localization at the inhibitory postsynaptic domain. Here we discuss advances that have led to an improved understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the delivery and stabilization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses and address the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor associated proteins and post-translational modifications in regulating this process.

Fig. 1. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking and associated proteins. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are assembled from individual subunits in the ER where the chaperones BiP and Calnexin assist in quality control. Unassembled GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits that are to be targeted for ER associated degradation are ubiquitinated and degraded in the proteasome. Plic can interact with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors thereby inhibiting their targeting for proteasomal degradation. Assembled pentameric GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors exit the ER and bind the guanine exchange factor BIG2 in the Golgi. Here they also interact with the palmitoylase transferase GODZ and GABARAP. GABARAP interacts with NSF, as does the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β subunit, and this association may facilitate transport of the receptor complexes to the cell surface. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are inserted at extrasynaptic sites and can diffuse along the plasma membrane in and out of synaptic domains. At synapses they are stabilized by an interaction with the scaffolding protein Gephyrin. The interaction of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor intracellular loops with the μ2 subunit of AP2 is important for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor internalization. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are delivered by a clathrin mediated pathway to early endosomes where they can be targeted for degradation in the lysosome or for recycling upon binding of Huntington associated protein (HAP1).

receptors are also regulated by several endogenous modulators including neurosteroids, protons and Zn²⁺ (Macdonald & Olsen, 1994; Belelli & Lambert, 2005; Hosie et al., 2007).

Like other members of the Cys-loop receptor family of ligand gated ion channels, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are polytopic type I membrane proteins. Each subunit shares a common subunit structure comprising a large extended N-terminal domain with potential glycosylation sites, four highly conserved transmembrane domains (TM1–4) and a large intracellular loop domain between TM3 and TM4 which protrudes into the cytoplasm (Connolly & Wafford, 2004). Electron microscopic and biochemical studies of the nACh receptor, support a model whereby members of this family are pentameric in structure where subunits are arranged around a central aqueous pore (Unwin, 1993). It is assumed that for all Cys-loop receptors, the subunit's α-helical TM2 domain lines the central water-filled pore, while TM1, TM3, and TM4 form the interface with lipids and isolate TM2 from a hydrophobic environment (Connolly & Wafford, 2004). The crystal structure of the soluble acetylcholine-binding protein, which shares approximately 20% sequence homology with nACh, GABA<sub>A/C</sub> and glycine receptors, suggests that the N-terminal domain of the Cys-loop receptor family consists of an alpha helix and a sandwich of antiparallel β sheets with conserved residues positioned in order to stabilize the protomers, whereas residues at their interfaces are highly variable (Brejc et al., 2001; Smit et al., 2001). The acetylcholine-binding protein structure has further contributed to our understanding of the structure-function parameters for Cys loop receptor of the family (Brejc et al., 2001; Smit et al., 2001), for example improving our understanding of binding of ligands and modulators of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function (for

example Zn²⁺ and neurosteroid binding) (Absalom et al., 2003; Chen et al., 2004; Smart et al., 2004; Hosie et al., 2006; Hosie et al., 2007). Sequences within the N-termini of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits are the primary sites for inter-subunit contact and oligomerisation. In contrast, the intracellular domain between TM domains 3 and 4 of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits is the main location for protein-protein interactions between the receptor and regulatory proteins in the cytosol important for regulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor activity, trafficking and localization. Furthermore, subunit intracellular domains are also a key site for receptor regulation by post-translational modifications of the receptor including palmitoylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation (Kittler & Moss, 2003; Jacob et al., 2008).

2. Regulation of the assembly, localisation, membrane trafficking and membrane dynamics of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor associated proteins

It has become clear over the last few years that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can be viewed as relatively dynamic entities. The number of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is in part determined by the exchange of synaptic and extrasynaptic surface receptors while the number of surface receptors is determined by the rates of receptor assembly, maturation through the secretory pathway and plasma membrane insertion, in addition to the rates of receptor cycling between surface and intracellular compartments (Fig. 1). Similarly the membrane dynamics of surface receptors are determined by the relationship of the receptors with inhibitory synaptic scaffold proteins, adhesion proteins and other resident components of the inhibitory synaptic domain (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. The inhibitory postsynaptic domain. Adhesion molecules including neurexin-neuroligin (NL) 2/3 complexes and the dystrophin glycoprotein complex are found enriched at inhibitory synapses where they are thought to be of major importance in the specification and validation of inhibitory synapses and the correct apposition of inhibitory presynaptic terminals. GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (blue) are confined to inhibitory synapses by scaffold molecules such as gephyrin (slate). Gephyrin can interact with a number of proteins enriched at inhibitory post-synaptic domains as well as cytoskeletal elements such as tubulin and actin. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)
Several proteins have been demonstrated to interact directly with $GABA_{A}$ receptors via the intracellular domain and TM4. The membrane trafficking of $GABA_{A}$ receptors appears to be tightly regulated by these $GABA_{A}$ receptor associated proteins (Fig. 1). In contrast to several of the inhibitory postsynaptic domain constituents which are highly enriched at inhibitory synapses, many of the $GABA_{A}$ receptor associated proteins so far identified are only marginally localized to synaptic sites. Instead they are thought to be important for receptor transport and maturation through the secretory pathway or for regulating endocytosis, post-endocytic sorting and recycling of receptors (Fig. 1).

### 2.1. $GABA_{A}$ receptor associated proteins and receptor transport, maturation and stability in the secretory pathway

A total of 16 genes encoding $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunits have been identified in the mammalian nervous system based on amino acid sequence homology: six $\alpha$ subunits, three $\beta$ subunits, three $\gamma$ subunits, in addition to $\delta$, $\varepsilon$, $\pi$ and $\theta$ (reviewed in Macdonald & Olsen, 1994; Moss & Smart, 2001; Connolly & Wafford, 2004). Despite the potential for a bewildering heterogeneity of receptor structure, a number of studies have revealed that only a limited number of receptor subunit combinations may exist on the neuronal cell surface (Moss & Smart, 2001; Sieghart & Sperk, 2002). In the brain, $GABA_{A}$ receptor molecular heterogeneity is in part restricted by regional and temporal selectivity in subunit expression (for reviews see Fritschy & Mohler, 1995; Pirker et al., 2000; Sieghart & Sperk, 2002). The heterogeneity of native $GABA_{A}$ receptors is further restricted by a number of assembly rules (Connolly & Wafford, 2004). Receptor oligomerisation occurs within the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) with assembly domains within subunit N-termini of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ mediating the oligomerisation of these subunits into heteromeric channels (reviewed in Bollan et al., 2003; Connolly & Wafford, 2004). Expression studies in cell lines have revealed that individual $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunits are mostly retained in the ER and are rapidly degraded when expressed alone. Co-expression of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits results in the production of functional GABA gated chloride channels (sensitive to picrotoxin, bicuculline, barbiturates and $Zn^{2+}$) in agreement with the binding site for GABA lying at the interface of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunits (Connolly & Wafford, 2004). The majority of native receptors also contain a $\gamma 2$ subunit, which confers benzodiazepine sensitivity and zinc insensitivity and is critical for synaptic targeting (Kittler & Moss, 2001; Bollan et al., 2003). The above results together with biochemical experiments suggest that the most prevalent $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunit composition in the brain consists of $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$ subunits with a majority of receptors containing $2\alpha$, $2\beta$ and $1\gamma$ subunit isoform (Moss & Smart, 2001; Bollan et al., 2003; Fritschy & Brunig, 2003; Luscher & Keller, 2004).

A number of receptor-associated proteins have been implicated in the $GABA_{A}$ receptor cell surface transport and maturation through the secretory pathway. $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunits associate with BiP and Calnexin in the ER, two chaperone molecules that assist in protein quality control in the ER (Connolly et al., 1996; Gorrie et al., 1997; Kleizen & Braakman, 2004). Interestingly, the interaction with calnexin is increased in $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunit mutations that lead to familial epilepsy syndromes (Bradley et al., 2008). Other proteins that are also implicated in $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunit stability at the ER include the ubiquitin related protein Plic-1 (also called ubiquilin). Plic-1 was identified to interact with $GABA_{A}$ receptors from yeast two hybrid (Y2H) screens with receptor $\alpha$ and $\beta$ subunit intracellular domains and is implicated in receptor transport and maturation through the secretory pathway (Bedford et al., 2001). Plic-1 contains a ubiquitin like (UBL) domain at its N-terminus and a ubiquitin associated domain (UBA) at its C-terminus (Kleijnen et al., 2000). Plic-1 interacts with all $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\alpha$ (1–6) and $\beta$ (1–3) subunit intracellular domains via its UBA domain (Bedford et al., 2001).

Immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopic studies demonstrated that Plic-1 is mainly expressed in intracellular compartments where it colocalises with $GABA_{A}$ receptors at subsynaptic membranes (Bedford et al., 2001). Blockade of the interaction between Plic-1 and $GABA_{A}$ receptors using interfering peptides results in reduced $GABA_{A}$ receptor cell surface expression whereas Plic-1 overexpression results in an increased $GABA_{A}$ receptor surface expression with no effect on receptor internalization rates (Bedford et al., 2001; Saliba et al., 2008). Plic-1 proteins regulate ubiquitin dependent protein degradation in the proteasome by their ability to bind ubiquitin ligases and components of the proteasome (Kleijnen et al., 2000, 2003) suggesting that Plic-1 modulates $GABA_{A}$ receptor surface numbers by inhibiting proteasomal degradation of the receptor (see also ubiquitination of $GABA_{A}$ receptors section below). In agreement with this, Plic-1 increases both the stability of ER resident $GABA_{A}$ receptors and the number of poly-ubiquitinated $GABA_{A}$ receptor subunits (Bedford et al., 2001; Saliba et al., 2008). Plic-1 also selectively increases the rates of receptor insertion into the surface membrane (Saliba et al., 2008). Several additional Plic family members, Plic-2–Plic-4, in addition to Plic-1, have been identified. Plic-2 has recently been demonstrated to be a negative regulator of G protein-coupled receptor endocytosis (while Plic-1 was not), which is dependent on the Plic-2 UBL domain (N'Diaye et al., 2008). Via their UBL domains, Plic proteins can interact with UIM containing endocytic adaptors such as eps15 and epsin, with preferential binding by Plic-2 over Plic-1 (Regan-Klapisz et al., 2005; Heir et al., 2006; N'Diaye et al., 2008). Plic-2 can also interact with $GABA_{A}$ receptors (Bedford et al., 2001), although whether Plic-2 (or other Plic members) also regulate $GABA_{A}$ receptor function remains to be determined. Similarly, whether there is a role for Plic-2 and eps15/epsin in regulating $GABA_{A}$ receptor endocytosis in addition to receptor surface insertion remains unknown. Interestingly Plic proteins have also more recently been implicated in the degradation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor $\alpha 3$ subunits (Ficklin et al., 2005) which are also members of the Cys loop family of ligand gated ion channels, suggesting that the Plic protein family may have a general role in regulating the trafficking and stability of ligand gated ion channels.

The guanine nucleotide exchange factor, brefeldin A-inhibited GDP/GTP exchange factor 2 (BIG2) has also been implicated in receptor transport and maturation through the secretory pathway. BIG2 can catalyse the GDP–GTP exchange on ARF GTPases, and was identified (from a Y2H screen) to interact with $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta(1-3)$ subunit intracellular domains (Charych et al., 2004b). BIG2 is primarily localized to the trans Golgi network, where it co-localises with $GABA_{A}$ receptors and has also been localised in vesicle-like structures along dendrites and near post-synaptic sites (Charych et al., 2004b). Interestingly, co-expression of BIG2 with the $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta 3$ subunit results in an increase in $\beta 3$ exit from the ER, suggesting that BIG2 may be involved in the post-Golgi vesicular trafficking of $GABA_{A}$ receptors (Charych et al., 2004b). BIG2 has also been demonstrated to play a role in the post-endocytic sorting of transferrin receptor (Shen et al., 2006) suggesting that BIG2 could also be similarly involved in the endocytosis or endocytic sorting of $GABA_{A}$ receptors, although this has not yet been demonstrated.

A number of proteins have been identified to interact directly with $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\gamma$-subunits and are also suggested to be important for the surface transport of $GABA_{A}$ receptors and their targeting to synapses. The 17 kDa $GABA_{A}$ receptor associated protein (GABARAP) interacts with $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\gamma$ subunits both in vitro and in vivo (Wang et al., 1999) and is a member of a family of homologous small microtubule binding proteins that also includes GABARAP like 1 (GBRL1, GEC1) GABARAP like 2 (GBRL2, GATE-16) and the light chain-3A and B (LC3A, LC3B) subunits of MAP-1A and 1B. Immunocytochemical and immunoelectron microscopy studies have revealed that GABARAP colocalizes with $GABA_{A}$ receptors primarily at the Golgi compartment and in subsynaptic cisternae (Wang et al., 1999; Kittler
et al., 2001). Immunofluorescence and electrophysiological studies demonstrate that GABARAP is important for the membrane trafficking of $GABA_{A}$ receptors to the plasma membrane and for inhibitory plasticity in the cerebellum (Leil et al., 2004; Boileau et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005, 2007; Kawaguchi & Hirano, 2007). Coexpression of GABARAP and $GABA_{A}$ receptors in COS-7 cells and neurons results in an increase in the levels of $GABA_{A}$ receptors expressed at the cell surface as well as an increase of GABA mediated currents in oocytes (Leil et al., 2004; Boileau et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2005, 2007). In addition, it has also been suggested that GABARAP can regulate receptor kinetic properties (Everitt et al., 2004; Luu et al., 2006).

Several GABARAP associated proteins have been identified that are implicated in GABARAP dependent regulation of $GABA_{A}$ receptor function and membrane trafficking. GABARAP interacts directly with N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF), a membrane fusion and trafficking factor that has also been implicated in the membrane trafficking of several neurotransmitter receptors including $GABA_{B}$ receptors and AMPA receptors (Nishimune et al., 1998; Pontier et al., 2006). More recently it has been demonstrated that NSF can interact directly with $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$-subunit intracellular domains and that co-expression of NSF with $GABA_{A}$ receptors reduces cell surface $GABA_{A}$ receptor number (Goto et al., 2005). GABARAP may exist in a tripartite complex with $GABA_{A}$ receptors and NSF or alternatively NSF may serve to regulate GABARAP dependent trafficking of $GABA_{A}$ receptors in a manner analogous to that of NSF dependent regulation of PICK and/or AP2 dependent regulation of AMPA receptor trafficking and cell surface stability (Hanley et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002). Intriguingly, as with the overlapping AMPA receptor GluR2 subunit interaction sites for NSF and AP2, the interaction domain within $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$-subunits for AP2 and NSF similarly overlaps although the significance of this observation currently remains unclear (Nishimune et al., 1998; Lee et al., 2002; Goto et al., 2005; Kittler et al., 2005). Y2H screens and in vitro binding studies have demonstrated that two other proteins localized to inhibitory postsynaptic domains, GRIP1 and gephyrin, interact with GABARAP suggesting that GABARAP may also be important for the synaptic transport of other components of the inhibitory postsynaptic domain in addition to $GABA_{A}$ receptors (Kneussel et al., 2000; Kittler et al., 2004a). GABARAP has also been shown to associate with PRIP-1 (Phospholipase-C related inactive protein type 1), which competes with the $\gamma 2$ subunit for GABARAP binding (Kanematsu et al., 2002). There are two PRIP genes in mammals, PRIP-1 and PRIP-2. Both PRIP-1 knockout mice and PRIP-1/PRIP-2 double knockout mice have impaired trafficking of $\gamma 2$ subunit containing $GABA_{A}$ receptors to the cell surface, resulting in altered modulation of $GABA_{A}$ receptors by pharmacological agents such as diazepam (Kanematsu et al., 2002; Mizokami et al., 2007). PRIP-1/PRIP-2 can also directly interact with $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$-subunits, and appear to regulate both receptor phosphorylation levels (via recruitment of phosphatases to the receptor) and receptor trafficking (Terunuma et al., 2004; Kanematsu et al., 2006; Mizokami et al., 2007). In contrast to cellular and molecular studies of GABARAP dependent functional regulation of $GABA_{A}$ receptors, gene deletion studies have shown that, in vivo, GABARAP is not essential for post synaptic trafficking of $GABA_{A}$ receptors (O'Sullivan et al., 2005). Since the closely related GBRL1 also associates directly with the $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\gamma 2$ subunit, it remains unclear if interaction with GBRL1 may compensate for GABARAP function in the GABARAP KO animals.

An SOS-recruitment Y2H approach identified the protein GODZ (Golgi-specific DHHC zinc finger domain protein) as another $\gamma 2$ subunit binding partner. The interaction is mediated by a 14-amino acid cysteine rich domain conserved in the intracellular loops of all three $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\gamma$ subunits (Keller et al., 2004). GODZ is primarily localized to the Golgi where there is partial overlap in localization with the $\gamma 2$ subunit in HEK293 cells but not in neurons (Keller et al., 2004). GODZ and its paralogue SERZ beta are palmitoyl transferases that are important for $GABA_{A}$ receptor transport to the

cell surface by regulating palmitoylation of the $\gamma 2$ subunit (see also palmitoylation section below) and GODZ function is required for the normal assembly and function of GABAergic synapses (Keller et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2006).

### 2.2. Role of $GABA_{A}$ receptor associated proteins in $GABA_{A}$ receptor endocytosis and endocytic sorting

The number of surface and synaptic $GABA_{A}$ receptors can also be regulated by their internalization from the cell membrane (Kittler et al., 2000). Internalization of $GABA_{A}$ receptors is primarily thought to occur via a clathrin and dynamin dependent mechanism (Kittler et al., 2000; Barnes, 2001). Dynamin independent receptor internalization of $GABA_{A}$ receptors heterologously expressed in cell lines has also been reported, as has dynamin and caveolin-dependent $GABA_{A}$ receptor endocytosis (Cinar & Barnes, 2001; Bradley et al., 2008). $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$- and $\gamma$-subunits intracellular domains can interact directly with the $\mu 2$ subunit of the clathrin adaptor protein AP2, which facilitates the recruitment of these receptors into the endocytic pathway (Kittler et al., 2000). $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$-subunits interact directly with AP2 via an atypical basic patch binding motif (Kittler et al., 2005; Smith et al., 2008) with homology to similar domains identified in synaptotagmin 1 (Haucke et al., 2000), AMPA receptors (Lee et al., 2002; Kastning et al., 2007) and alpha 1b adrenergic receptors (Diviani et al., 2003). In the case of $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$-subunits, this AP2 binding motif (residues ${ }^{401} \mathrm{KTHLRRRSSQLK}^{412}$ in the $\beta 3$-subunit) also contains the major site for phosphorylation by serine and threonine kinases (Kittler & Moss, 2003) and interestingly the interaction with AP2 is negatively regulated by serine phosphorylation (Kittler et al., 2005) (see phosphorylation section below). Blocking $GABA_{A}$ receptor internalization, by either targeting dynamin function or by blocking $GABA_{A}$ receptor $\beta$-subunit interaction with AP2 dramatically increases synaptic $GABA_{A}$ receptor mediated currents, highlighting the importance of dynamin and AP2 dependent receptor internalization for regulating synaptic receptor number and inhibitory synapse strength (Kittler et al., 2000, 2005). Clathrin dependent $GABA_{A}$ receptor internalization is also dependent on a di-leucine type motif within the $GABA_{A} \beta 2$ subunit (Herring et al., 2005) but whether this motif also mediates direct interaction with endocytic adaptor proteins and whether receptor endocytosis via this motif can be regulated, or is a constitutive mechanism remains unknown. $GABA_{A}$ receptors can also bind directly with high affinity to the $\mu 2$ subunit of AP2 via a tyrosine type Yxx$\theta$ motif (where x represents any amino acid and $\theta$ an amino acid with a bulky hydrophobic side chain) within the $\gamma 2$ subunit intracellular loop (residues ${ }^{365} \mathrm{YGYECL}^{370}$) (Kittler et al., 2008). Structural studies of the $\gamma 2$ subunit YGYECL-peptide co-crystallized with AP2 revealed that both Y365 and Y367 within this motif, in addition to L370, were important for the interaction. Y365 acts as an additional specificity determinant of the $\gamma 2$-AP2 interaction by binding into a third pocket on $\mu 2$-AP2 providing an explanation for the high affinity of this motif for AP2. Furthermore, the structure suggested that $\gamma 2$ subunit containing $GABA_{A}$ receptors may be internalized as dimers or multimers, and it will be interesting to further investigate this possibility (Kittler et al., 2008). Dialysis of a function blocking peptide to the $\gamma 2$ subunit specific AP2 binding motif significantly increased mIPSC amplitude, similar to what was previously observed upon blockade of the $\beta 3$ subunit AP2 interaction. Co-dialysis of peptides targeting both the $\beta 3$ and $\gamma 2$ AP2 interaction mechanisms had an additive effect on mIPSC amplitude suggesting that these two mechanisms can act either separately or in concert to regulate synaptic receptor number (Kittler et al., 2008). Thus, synaptic $GABA_{A}$ receptor number can be controlled by at least two mechanisms for AP2-dependent receptor recruitment into the internalization pathway, one of which is $\gamma 2$-subunit-selective. In addition to direct binding of the receptor to AP2, the $GABA_{A}$ receptor associated proteins GABARAP and PRIP-1 have been demonstrated to interact with clathrin heavy chain and AP2

respectively (Kanematsu et al., 2007; Mohrluder et al., 2007), however the relationship between these molecules for regulating receptor downmodulation are still not fully understood.

Internalized GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can be either targeted for degradation in the lysosome or rapidly recycled back to the cell surface (Kittler et al., 2004b). From a Y2H screen with a β-subunit intracellular domain a direct interaction of the intracellular loop of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β-subunits with the huntingtin associated protein 1 (HAP1) was identified (Kittler et al., 2004b). HAP1 expression was found to block the targeting of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors for degradation in lysosomes and to facilitate the recycling of receptors back to the cell surface and synapses (Kittler et al., 2004b). Interestingly, decreasing HAP1 levels in the hypothalamus using siRNA leads to reduced levels and activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and altered animal feeding suggesting that HAP1 dependent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking may underlie important aspects of normal animal behavior (Kittler et al., 2004b; Sheng et al., 2006). Recently, the γ2 subunit has been found to interact with calcium-modulating cyclophilin ligand (CAML), dependent on both the γ2 subunit intracellular domain and the fourth transmembrane domain of the subunit (Yuan et al., 2008). Knockdown of CAML by shRNAi results in neurons with reduced GABA-evoked currents and GABAAergic synaptic function. Interestingly, while CAML co-localises with γ2 subunits in ER vesicles, the main trafficking defect of disrupted CAML function appears to be a reduction in the endocytic recycling of receptors (Yuan et al., 2008).

### 2.3. Other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor associated proteins

Several other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor associated proteins have been identified. The GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor interacting factor 1 GRIF-1 was identified from a yeast two-hybrid screen with the intracellular domain of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β2 subunit and the related TRAK1 is also proposed to interact with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor complexes (Beck et al., 2002; Gilbert et al., 2006). GRIF-1 was found to interact with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors *in vitro* and in cell lines (Beck et al., 2002). The role of GRIF-1 with respect to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function remains unclear. However, the demonstration that GRIF-1 can also interact with the potassium channel Kir2.1 to regulate its trafficking (Grishin et al., 2006), suggests that GRIF-1 may also be involved in the trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors. Intriguingly GRIF-1 and TRAK1 have also been implicated in the trafficking of a number of organelles in both cell lines and neurons including mitochondria and endosomes (Brickley et al., 2005; Kirk et al., 2006; MacAskill et al., 2009), suggesting that this protein family may have diverse functions within cells. Immunopurification approaches have also identified an interaction between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the multifunctional protein gClqR but the role of this interaction remains unknown (Schaerer et al., 2001).

A number of other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor associated proteins are proposed to link GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to the cytoskeleton. GABARAP and gephyrin are both tubulin binding proteins suggesting they may link GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to microtubules, although it remains unclear for GABARAP where in the cell this linkage may be occurring, since GABARAP does not appear to be highly expressed at synapses (Kittler et al., 2001). In addition, GABARAP has also been shown to interact with microfilaments (Wang & Olsen, 2000). The ERM family member radixin was identified by yeast two hybrid to interact with extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α5 subunits. Radixin's ability to bind to actin suggests that it may act to link α5 subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to the actin cytoskeleton and thus to be important for the formation of some populations of extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (Loebrich et al., 2006).

Modulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function is in part achieved by the phosphorylation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits (extensively reviewed in Brandon et al., 2002; Kittler & Moss, 2003; Song & Messing, 2005). GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are substrates for a number of protein kinases and phosphatases (see the following section). Several proteins involved in regulating the phosphorylation state of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors interact directly with subunit intracellular domains. These include the receptor for activated C kinase (RACK1) in addition to protein kinase C (PKC) itself and the protein kinase A (PKA) anchoring protein AKAP150, which all interact directly with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β subunits to regulate receptor phosphorylation (Brandon et al., 1999, 2003). In addition, dephosphorylation of receptors is mediated by the protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, which interact with β subunit intracellular domains while calcineurin can interact in an activity dependent manner with the γ2 subunit intracellular domain (Wang et al., 2003a; Jovanovic et al., 2004; Terunuma et al., 2004).

## 3. Regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking and synaptic receptor number by receptor post-translational modifications

### 3.1. Phosphorylation

A large number of studies on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor phosphorylation have implicated this process in altering channel kinetics, channel open time, rate of desensitization and sensitivity to pharmacological agents (reviewed in Brandon et al., 2002; Kittler & Moss, 2003; Song & Messing, 2005). Direct receptor phosphorylation has also been implicated in regulating receptor trafficking. The large intracellular domains of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β subunits contain a number of sites for phosphorylation including conserved serine residues (S409 in β1, S410 in β2, S408/409 in β3) that can be phosphorylated by a number of kinases both *in vitro* and *in vivo* including PKA, PKC, and AKT. Phosphorylation of S410 in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β2 subunits by insulin dependent AKT activation mediates an increase of surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor number and trafficking to synaptic sites to potentiate the inhibitory synaptic response (Wang et al., 2003b). In addition, brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) induced PKC mediated phosphorylation of the β3 subunit results in a transient enhancement of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function followed by a lasting depression of miniature inhibitory post-synaptic currents (mIPSCs) in both cultured hippocampal and cortical neurons (Jovanovic et al., 2004). This BDNF-dependent modulation correlated with an increase in surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor number (Jovanovic et al., 2004).

In the case of β-subunits, the domain that mediates interaction with the clathrin adaptor AP2 overlaps with these important sites for β-subunit phosphorylation (Kittler & Moss, 2003) and interestingly phosphorylation negatively regulates AP2 binding. In the β3 subunit, dephosphorylation of S408/S409 unmasks the basic patch-binding motif for AP2, enhancing the endocytosis of selected GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes (Kittler et al., 2005; Terunuma et al., 2008). Blocking this internalization pathway with a dynamin inhibitory peptide or a peptide that selectively blocks interaction of β-subunits with AP2 inhibits D3 dopamine receptor dependent downmodulation of inhibitory synapse strength in the striatum (Chen et al., 2006). D3 dopamine receptor dependent downmodulation of synaptic inhibition in CA1 hippocampal pyramidal cells, leading to facilitated hippocampal long term potentiation, is also dependent on enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor endocytosis and is similarly blocked by function blocking dynamin peptides (Swant et al., 2008). Thus, phospho-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking may be an important control point for regulating cell and network activity in the brain. Furthermore, enhanced pathological surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor downmodulation due to dephosphorylation of S408/S409 during status epilepticus can also be blocked by targeting this phospho-dependent endocytosis pathway with a selective AP2 blocking peptide, restoring the efficacy of synaptic inhibition in status epilepticus (Terunuma et al., 2008). Selectively blocking GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor interaction with AP2 or enhancing receptor phosphorylation may provide novel therapeutic strategies to ameliorate SE or other nervous system diseases where downmodulation of surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor number leads to pathological disinhibition. This suggests that phospho-dependent alterations in
AP2-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor endocytosis may be a critical mechanism underlying functional modulation of inhibition during synaptic plasticity and in pathology.

The γ2 subunit is also a substrate for phosphorylation by serine/threonine kinases (e.g. PKC) at S327 as well as S343 in γ2L (Kittler & Moss, 2003). The dephosphorylation of the γ2 subunit at S327 in hippocampal neurons by calcineurin has been shown to result in a downregulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor function (Wang et al., 2003a) although it remains unclear if this effect is dependent on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking. In addition, the γ2 subunit can be phosphorylated by Src family kinases on tyrosine residues Y365 and Y367 (Kittler & Moss, 2003). Biochemical and structural studies have revealed that the interaction of AP2 via the γ2 subunit specific tyrosine motif is inhibited by phosphorylation of the Y365 and Y367 residues within the motif. Since a significant proportion of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ2 subunits are tyrosine phosphorylated at these sites under resting conditions (Brandon et al., 2001), this would prevent the high affinity AP2 binding site from constitutively recruiting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors into the endocytic pathway under resting conditions. However, conditions that would promote tyrosine de-phosphorylation of the receptor would be expected to promote receptor endocytosis. It will be interesting to determine which phosphatases dephosphorylate this site *in vivo* and whether the rapid internalization of γ2 subunit containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors during status epilepticus (Naylor et al., 2005; Goodkin et al., 2008), is mediated by tyrosine de-phosphorylation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ2 subunit AP2 binding site.

GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor interactions with AP2 can be controlled by phosphorylation at two sites within the receptor, one on β-subunits and one on the γ2 subunit. The reason for two phospho-dependent AP2 interaction mechanisms remains unclear, but since both mechanisms are regulated by different kinase families (i.e. serine/threonine or tyrosine kinase for β- and γ2 respectively) this suggests that this may have evolved to allow for tight regulation of AP2-dependent synaptic receptor number by multiple signaling cascades that converge at the level of receptor phosphorylation (Kittler et al., 2008). Much remains to be determined regarding phospho-dependent regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking. Of particular interest will be to better understand the role of signaling pathways for regulating receptor trafficking and synaptic inhibition *in vivo* and the contribution this plays in regulating network function and animal behavior. For example, it will be interesting to determine the role of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor phosphorylation in regulating state-dependent bidirectional modification of somatic inhibition in neocortical pyramidal cells, which was recently shown to be dependent on rapid activity-dependent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking via calcium channel activation (Kurotani et al., 2008). The use of knock-in mice with mutations in key GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor phosphorylation sites, a strategy that has been successfully applied to elucidating the role of phosphorylation in regulating AMPA receptor trafficking and synaptic plasticity, will be an important step (Lee et al., 2000; Lee et al., 2003; Hu et al., 2007).

### 3.2. Palmitoylation

Palmitoylation is a post-translational modification that involves the attachment of the fatty acid palmitate to cysteine residues and is involved in the membrane targeting and subcellular trafficking of various proteins including AMPA receptors, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and the neuronal scaffold proteins PSD-95 and GRIP (DeSouza et al., 2002; El-Husseini et al., 2002; Smotrys & Linder, 2004). The γ2 subunit contains cysteine residues within its intracellular domain that have been shown to serve as substrates for palmitoylation. Mutating the palmitoylation substrates (cysteine residues) within the intracellular loop of the γ2 subunit resulted in a loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters at the cell surface as did treatment of neurons with the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BrP (Rathenberg et al., 2004). Thus, palmitoylation of the

γ2 subunit appears to be important for correct surface delivery and synaptic targeting of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (Keller et al., 2004; Rathenberg et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2006). Palmitoylation of γ2 subunits is mediated by the receptor associated protein GODZ (and to a lesser extent by a GODZ paralogue, SERZ beta) which interacts directly with the γ2 subunit intracellular domain and is necessary for the formation and normal function of inhibitory synapses (Keller et al., 2004; Fang et al., 2006). The exact mechanisms by which GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor palmitoylation regulates the trafficking and clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors remain unknown. Other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits, including γ1, γ3, θ, ε and π also contain cysteine residues within their intracellular domains, although whether they are substrates for palmitoylation remains to be addressed.

### 3.3. Ubiquitination

The regulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking and receptor degradation in the ubiquitin proteosome system by the ubiquitin like protein Plic-1 first suggested that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may also be a direct target for ubiquitination (Bedford et al., 2001). In agreement with this, studies have demonstrated that the intracellular loop of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β3 subunit contains a number of lysine residues that are substrates for ubiquitination (Saliba et al., 2007). Mutation of all 12 lysines within the intracellular loop of the β3 subunit resulted in decreased levels of β3 subunit ubiquitination without compromising the ability of this subunit to assemble into benzodiazepine sensitive heteromeric receptors. Expression of this mutant (β3<sup>K12R</sup>) in cultured cortical neurons showed increased cell surface expression of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors compared to neurons expressing wild type β3 subunits, although the cell surface half life or endocytosis rates of the receptors were not affected. In addition, the rate of insertion at the cell surface of the β3<sup>K12R</sup> subunit was greater than that of the wild type subunit. Ubiquitination of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β-subunits is dependent on neuronal activity levels (Saliba et al., 2007). Blockade of neuronal activity dramatically increases GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor ubiquitination levels, which correlates with a loss of surface receptor expression levels and a reduction in the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs. In contrast, increasing neuronal activity levels has the converse effect, decreasing receptor ubiquitination rates. Thus, activity-dependent ubiquitination of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β-subunits can act specifically within the secretory pathway to regulate GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor insertion at the cell surface (Saliba et al., 2007). Ubiquitination of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits appears to target unassembled subunits within the ER for ER associated degradation (ERAD) by the proteasome (Bedford et al., 2001; Gallagher et al., 2007; Saliba et al., 2007). This mechanism also appears to be important for regulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit stability and degradation under pathological conditions. For example, a form of dominant juvenile myoclonic epilepsy caused by a non-conservative missense mutation A322D in the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 subunit leads to subunit misfolding, ubiquitination and rapid ERAD through the ubiquitin proteasome system, dramatically reducing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor cell surface expression, which leads to compromised inhibition and epilepsy (Gallagher et al., 2007).

## 4. The inhibitory postsynaptic domain and its role in regulating the membrane stability and subcellular localization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors

Both during synaptogenesis and once synapses have been formed, specific mechanisms must exist to target GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from intracellular or extrasynaptic compartments and retain them at inhibitory synapses. Several proteins have been specifically localized to the inhibitory postsynaptic domain and are proposed to play an important role in regulating the formation, maintenance and plasticity of these synapses and influencing surface trafficking,
synaptic localization and residency time of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (Fig. 2).

### 4.1. Gephyrin and the regulation of the synaptic clustering, localization and stability of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses

The 93 kDa protein gephyrin, which was initially isolated as a protein co-purifying with glycine receptors (Pfeiffer et al., 1982), was one of the first proteins found enriched at inhibitory synapses (Triller et al., 1987). Using immunofluorescence and electron microscopic approaches, gephyrin has been conclusively shown to accumulate at inhibitory GABAAergic (and also glycinergic) synapses and substantial work has focused on elucidating the role gephyrin plays in synaptic organisation (Fritschy et al., 2008). However, there are key differences between gephyrin's relationship with glycine receptors versus GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses. A high affinity direct interaction between gephyrin and glycine receptors exists *in vivo*, mediated by a 14 residue stretch in the glycine receptor β-subunit loop and clustering of glycine receptors appears to be critically dependent on gephyrin (Meyer et al., 1995). In contrast, although it has been demonstrated that gephyrin can be recruited to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ2 subunit or gephyrin KO experiments have emphasized the relationship between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering and gephyrin (see next section) (Essrich et al., 1998; Alldred et al., 2005), an interaction between gephyrin and native GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors *in vivo* has so far remained elusive. Recently a direct interaction between gephyrin and the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α2 subunit was demonstrated (Tretter et al., 2008). In this study a hydrophobic 10 amino acid motif identified in the intracellular loop of the α2 subunit was found to be responsible for α2 clustering in cultured hippocampal neurons. Under conditions lacking detergent, a direct interaction between gephyrin and the α2 subunit has been observed *in vitro*, however under the same conditions GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor β- and γ-subunits were unable to interact with gephyrin (Tretter et al., 2008). It will be interesting to further elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of this interaction. Whether or not gephyrin can, in addition, interact with other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors indirectly via a bridging molecule remains unclear. Furthermore, in contrast to the dependency of gephyrin for glycine receptor clustering, not all subtypes of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor are clustered by gephyrin dependent mechanisms.

### 4.2. Gephyrin cluster formation

Gephyrin, which forms clusters at inhibitory synapses, is made up of an N-terminal G-domain linked by a 170 residue central region to a C-terminal E-domain giving it a modular structure (Sola et al., 2001; Kim et al., 2006). Evolutionarily it is thought this structure originates from the fusion of two genes of bacterial origin (Moe and MogA), which are important for molybdenum co-factor biosynthesis and homologous to gephyrin E- and G-domains respectively (Sola et al., 2001; Xiang et al., 2001; Bader et al., 2004). Structural and biochemical studies provide the basis for a model of how gephyrin can form clusters at inhibitory postsynaptic domains (Bedet et al., 2006; Lardi-Studler & Fritschy, 2007). The gephyrin N-terminal G-domain and C-terminal E-domain can form trimers and dimers respectively, leading to the formation of a hexagonal lattice which may allow the sequestration/entrapment of inhibitory receptors (Sola et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2006). Blue Native-PAGE experiments revealed that some affinity purified gephyrin complexes run on the gel as hexamers which may represent dimers of trimers, whereas gephyrin mutants that can no longer oligomerise no longer form hexamers (Saiyed et al., 2007). Gephyrin hexamers may therefore be a natural intermediate in the formation of the gephyrin lattice. In agreement with the above results, interfering with gephyrin dimerisation and trimerisation has been demonstrated to inhibit gephyrin's ability to form clusters and causes disruption of both GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor and glycine receptor clustering at inhibitory postsynaptic sites in

neurons, confirming the essential role of G and E-domains for clustering gephyrin and inhibitory receptors at synapses. Several splice variants of gephyrin have been identified that could potentially explain its functional diversity (reviewed in Fritschy et al., 2008). Interestingly, a specific role for gephyrin splice variants in regulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor distribution has been proposed while insertion of a gephyrin splice cassette C5' into the gephyrin N-terminal G-domain interferes with N-terminal trimerisation (Meier et al., 2000; Rees et al., 2003; Meier & Grantyn, 2004; Bedet et al., 2006; Paarmann et al., 2006; Saiyed et al., 2007; Fritschy et al., 2008). Further investigation of gephyrin splicing in regulating the synaptic recruitment of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is an important goal.

### 4.3. Gephyrin associated proteins

A number of gephyrin interacting partners have been identified including the guanylate exchange factor (GEF) for Cdc42 collybistin (Kins et al., 2000), tubulin (Prior et al., 1992), the motor protein component dynein light chain (DLC) (Fuhrmann et al., 2002), Mena/VASP (Giesemann et al., 2003), profilin isoforms I and II (Mammoto et al., 1998), RAFT (Sabatini et al., 1999), Pin1 (Zita et al., 2007) and GRIP1 (Yu et al., 2008). Several of the proteins suggest a functional link between gephyrin and tubulin and actin cytoskeleton dependent anchoring and/or transport processes. Gephyrin binding to tubulin may provide a direct link between gephyrin and microtubules. In addition, a link to the actin cytoskeleton is suggested by gephyrin's ability to interact directly with profilin I and profilin II, proteins that can bind actin monomers, and Mena and VASP, which are actin microfilament adaptors (Mammoto et al., 1998; Giesemann et al., 2003; Bausen et al., 2006). Several gephyrin interacting proteins have been found to partially colocalise with gephyrin at inhibitory GABAAergic synapses including Mena/VASP, DLC and GRIP1.

Collybistin is a member of the Dbl family of GEFs which are composed of tandem Dbl-homology (DH) and pleckstrin-homology domains and can specifically accelerate the GDP-GTP exchange on the small Rho GTPases Cdc42, Rac and Rho (Kins et al., 2000). Collybistin is thought to be specific for Cdc42, a GTPase which can regulate a number of cellular processes including the reorganisation of actin filaments. Collybistin exists in a number of splice variants with three alternatively spliced C-terminal isoforms combined with presence or absence of an N-terminal SH3 domain. Collybistin 2 (the shortest version) can recruit gephyrin to submembranous clusters which can recruit glycine receptors (Kins et al., 2000; Harvey et al., 2004). Since gephyrin can interact with components of the cytoskeleton, collybistin may act in part to regulate gephyrin function and receptor clustering by controlling local actin dynamics around the gephyrin lattice. Interestingly, recent biochemical and structural studies suggest that gephyrin binding may inhibit collybistin GEF activity (Xiang et al., 2006) and therefore regulate Cdc42 signaling activity during inhibitory synapse formation or plasticity.

Gephyrin can also interact with dynein light chain 1 and 2 (Fuhrmann et al., 2002). The interaction between gephyrin and dynein light chain allows the recruitment of both gephyrin and glycine receptors to dynein motor complexes for retrograde transport in neurons (Fuhrmann et al., 2002; Maas et al., 2006). Whether a similar gephyrin dependent recruitment of dynein to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors occurs, and whether gephyrin also plays a role in the intracellular transport of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has not yet been established. However the recent report that RNAi mediated knockdown of gephyrin has no effect on whole cell GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor current suggests that gephyrin is unlikely to have a role in steady state receptor transport to the plasma membrane (Yu et al., 2007).

GRIP1 (Glutamate receptor interacting protein 1) and its homologue GRIP2 are 7 PDZ domain containing (6 in the case of GRIP2) proteins originally identified to interact with glutamate receptors and to be localized at excitatory synapses. Immunofluorescence and

immunoelctron microscopic studies have demonstrated that several GRIP1 splice variants (GRIP1a, GRIP1b and GRIP1c4–7) also co-localise with gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses in intact brain (Burette et al., 1999; Dong et al., 1999; Wyszynski et al., 1999; Charych et al., 2004a; Li et al., 2005; Charych et al., 2006). GRIP1 associates with several proteins including the C-termini of AMPA receptor GluR2/3 and 4c subunits, ephrins and their receptors, the proteoglycan NG2, the extracellular matrix protein Fraser syndrome protein 1, GRASPs (for GRIP associated proteins) and liprin α family members (Dong et al., 1997; Dong et al., 1999; Ye et al., 2000; Wyszynski et al., 2002; Stegmuller et al., 2003; Charych et al., 2004a; Takamiya et al., 2004) in addition to several signaling molecules and proteins implicated in cytoskeletal transport processes including kinesin motor proteins and the microtubule associated and γ2 subunit binding protein GABARAP. Interestingly, a direct interaction between gephyrin and GRIP1 was recently identified further supporting an important role for this scaffold at inhibitory synapses (Yu et al., 2008). The role of GRIP1 at inhibitory synapses remains unclear but may be linked to GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking. While under resting conditions knockdown of GRIP1 levels does not appear to influence the accumulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory synapses (Hoogenraad et al., 2005), GRIP1 (in conjunction with GABARAP) does appear to be important for NMDA receptor dependent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor trafficking and membrane insertion (Marsden et al., 2007).

### 4.4. Gephyrin and collybistin dependent regulation of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor recruitment and clustering

The exact role and mechanism by which gephyrin regulates the formation and/or maintenance of inhibitory GABAergic synapses and the synaptic recruitment and/or stabilization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are still to be established. Gephyrin KO mice and gephyrin antisense studies have provided substantial evidence that gephyrin is essential for facilitating the clustering and synaptic localisation of all glycine receptors (Kirsch et al., 1993; Feng et al., 1998; Levi et al., 2004). In agreement with this gephyrin knockout mice die soon after birth and exhibit a rigid hyper-extended posture which is similar to the phenotype of animals treated with the glycine receptor blocker strychnine, suggesting a dramatic disruption of glycinergic transmission (Feng et al., 1998). In contrast, the effects of depleting gephyrin on the function of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and GABAergic synapses are less clear. In cultured hippocampal neurons subjected to either RNAi or antisense mediated gephyrin knockdown there is a dramatic reduction in the density of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters containing α2, γ2 and β2/3 subunits (Essrich et al., 1998; Jacob et al., 2005; Yu et al., 2007). In hippocampal neurons cultured from gephyrin knockout mice a complete absence of α2 and γ2 containing clusters was reported in one study (Kneussel et al., 1999) however other studies have demonstrated that although surface and synaptic clusters of α2 and γ2 subunits were significantly reduced many GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters could still be detected (Levi et al., 2004). In both gephyrin knockout neurons and neurons treated with gephyrin siRNAi, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1 subunit (and in some studies α5 subunit) clusters were unaffected. This suggests that gephyrin may contribute only partially to aggregation/clustering of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses and that the effect may be subunit specific (Kneussel et al., 2001; Levi et al., 2002, 2004). In agreement with this, GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) in gephyrin knockout neurons are present, but have a reduced amplitude and neurons acutely treated with gephyrin RNAi show a significant (approximately 50%) reduction in mIPSC amplitude and an even larger effect on frequency. Thus, while gephyrin is clearly important for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering these results also suggest that GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering mechanisms that are independent of gephyrin must exist and may compensate during inhibitory synapse development in the complete absence of gephyrin in gephyrin knockout neurons (Levi et al., 2004).

Importantly it has also been demonstrated that gephyrin clustering at GABAergic synapses is itself dependent on GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors themselves. In neurons *in vivo* or cultured from GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α1, α3 and γ2 subunit knockout mice gephyrin does not form synaptic clusters but instead forms large intracellular aggregates (Essrich et al., 1998; Alldred et al., 2005; Studer et al., 2006; Lardi-Studler & Fritschy, 2007). In agreement with these results, artificial aggregation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors induces co-clustering of gephyrin (Levi et al., 2004). These results suggest that clustered synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors may facilitate recruitment and stabilization of gephyrin at synapses. Additionally, RNAi mediated gephyrin knockdown combined with fluorescence imaging of GFP labelled GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors revealed that the mobility of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters at the cell surface is regulated by gephyrin suggesting that at inhibitory synapses gephyrin may further stabilize newly recruited GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors by forming a submembranous lattice (Jacob et al., 2005). This would provide a feedback loop to promote and validate the formation of inhibitory postsynaptic specializations.

Recent knockout studies on the role of collybistin further support an important role for gephyrin and collybistin in regulating the formation and maintenance of a subset of inhibitory GABAergic specializations and the accumulation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synapses. Constitutive ablation of collybistin expression results in a loss of gephyrin and gephyrin dependent GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering at a subset of inhibitory synapses, most notably in the hippocampus. Surprisingly, there was no significant impairment of gephyrin dependent glycine receptor clustering (Papadopoulos et al., 2007). Altered GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clustering in collybistin knockout mice is accompanied by significant changes in hippocampal plasticity, including an enhancement in long-term potentiation and reduction in long term depression, with animals exhibiting increased anxiety and impaired spatial learning. More recently, Cre-lox transgenesis was used to conditionally ablate collybistin in the forebrain during various developmental stages. Inactivation of collybistin during embryonic development blocked gephyrin clustering during synaptogenesis resulting in gephyrin aggregate accumulation in the cell soma (Papadopoulos et al., 2007). Deletion of collybistin during the third postnatal week resulted in a protracted loss of postsynaptic gephyrin clusters and synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ2 subunits and correlated with the appearance cytoplasmic gephyrin aggregates. Thus collybistin appears to be vitally important for the localisation and maintenance of gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters at a subset of inhibitory synapses in the hippocampus.

## 5. Cell adhesion complexes at the inhibitory synapse

The exact mechanisms that underlie the precise alignment of presynaptic terminals from innervating neurons with postsynaptic domains containing the cognate neurotransmitter receptor remain unclear. It has become clear however that in addition to postsynaptic scaffold proteins a critical role also exists for cell adhesion molecules that can span the synapse, linking pre and postsynaptic membranes. A number of cell adhesion molecules including cadherins (Benson & Tanaka, 1998), neurexin/neuroligin complexes and dystroglycan complexes have been localized to inhibitory synapses and are proposed to play an important role in their formation and maintenance (Fig. 1). Cell adhesion molecules in cooperation with synaptic scaffolds are likely to play a key role in facilitating the accumulation of surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at synaptic sites.

### 5.1. Neurexins and neuroligins

The neurexins and their postsynaptic counterparts the neuroligins, are thought to act as key trans-synaptic organizing molecules at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses (Ushkaryov et al., 1992). A number of neurexin binding partners have been identified including neurexophilins, dystroglycan and neuroligins, (Craig & Kang, 2007).
Neurexins and neuroligins form cell adhesion complexes that span the synaptic cleft, with neurexins localised on the presynaptic side and the neuroligins located in the postsynaptic domain (Craig & Kang, 2007). Neurexins are also proposed to interact with postsynaptic dystroglycan complexes (Sugita et al., 2001). When neuroligins are expressed in a human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line they can induce glutamatergic or GABAergic axons (in part depending on the neurexin) from co-cultured neurons to form functional release sites onto these non-neuronal cells (Scheiffele et al., 2000) suggesting that neurexin/neuroligin complexes may be important for the formation or maintenance of synaptic connections. Complimentary co-culture experiments, where neurexins were presented on the surface of beads or expressed alone in non-neuronal cells revealed these proteins could trigger postsynaptic differentiation and clustering of postsynaptic receptors and scaffolds in contacting dendrites (Graf et al., 2004; Craig & Kang, 2007; Huang & Scheiffele, 2008).

Three vertebrate genes encode for neurexins (Neurexin I, II and III) each containing two independent promoters that allow the formation of either α- or β-neurexins. Neurexins are neuro-specific cell surface proteins that contain a large extracellular N-terminal domain, transmembrane region and short intracellular C-terminus. Neurexins can be spliced at five different sites (three in α- and two in β-neurexins) allowing for the expression of hundreds of alternatively spliced isoforms (Craig & Kang, 2007; Huang & Scheiffele, 2008). The α-neurexins N-terminal domain contains six laminin-neurexin-sex hormone-binding globulin (LNS) domains and three EGF-like regions whereas the shorter β-neurexins contain only a single LNS domain, however both α- and β-neurexins bind to neuroligins. α- and β-neurexins have a relatively short intracellular domain which can bind to a number of presynaptic interacting proteins including synaptotagmin, CASK, syntenin and Mint (Craig & Kang, 2007; Huang & Scheiffele, 2008).

The four main neuroligin isoforms in mammals (neuroligin 1–4) comprise a large extracellular neurexin binding domain similar in structure to acetylcholinesterase and which may also allow neuroligins to homo-multimerise. Neuroligins also have a relatively short intracellular domain containing a PDZ domain ligand that is believed to link them to several PDZ domain containing postsynaptic proteins including PSD-95 and S-SCAM family members (Meyer et al., 2004; Craig & Kang, 2007). The importance of neuroligins for the formation of inhibitory synapses was suggested by the specific localization of neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-2 to excitatory and inhibitory synapses, respectively (Varoqueaux et al., 2004). Recently, neuroligin-3 has been localized to both inhibitory and excitatory synapses (Budreck & Scheiffele, 2007). Interestingly, mutant mice carrying an autism associated point mutation in neuroligin-3 exhibit enhanced inhibitory synaptic function (Tabuchi et al., 2007). When presented alone on the surface of HEK cells or beads neurexin is sufficient to induce the localised clustering of glutamatergic and GABAergic postsynaptic receptors and scaffolds (Graf et al., 2004). In the converse experiment, neuroligin-1 induces clustering of excitatory postsynaptic components while neuroligin-2 redistributes both excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic proteins. The presynaptic contacts induced by neuroligins co-expressed with either AMPA receptors or GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and co-cultured with neurons produce miniature excitatory or inhibitory postsynaptic currents that exhibit many of the release characteristics of normal synapses (Fu et al., 2003; Dong et al., 2007).

Knockdown (by RNA interference) of neuroligins-1, -2 or -3 in hippocampal cultures reduced the density of inhibitory and excitatory synapses identified by immunofluorescence with inhibitory and excitatory presynaptic markers (Chih et al., 2005) and also resulted in a large reduction in the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs providing additional evidence for a critical role of neuroligins as inhibitory synaptogenic molecules (Chih et al., 2005). The synaptogenic activity of neurexins/neuroligins appears to be in part dependent on alternative splicing in splice site B of the neuroligin

AChE-domain and at site 4 in β-neurexins. It has been proposed that neuroligin lacking a splice insert in splice B together with β-neurexins containing an S4 insert together selectively promote differentiation of GABAergic synapses, whereas β-neurexins lacking S4 but containing splice insert B selectively promote differentiation of glutamatergic synapses (Boucard et al., 2005; Chih et al., 2006; Craig & Kang, 2007). Recently it has been shown that α-neurexin synaptogenic activity appears to be almost exclusively GABAergic (Kang et al., 2008). Loss of all three alpha-neurexins in triple alpha-neurexin knockout mice results in a 50% decrease in inhibitory synapses in the brainstem (Missler et al., 2003).

Gene deletion studies have revealed that in vivo neuroligin function appears essential for synaptic function and animal survival but does not appear to be required for synapse formation per se (Varoqueaux et al., 2006; Craig & Kang, 2007; Taniguchi et al., 2007). Recent work suggests that rather than inducing the differentiation of new synapses, neurexin/neuroligin complexes may act to specify and validate already formed synapses by an activity dependent mechanism (Chubykin et al., 2007). In this model, activity dependent postsynaptic signaling mechanisms could converge on either neuroligin-1 or neuroligin-2 to validate the formation of excitatory versus inhibitory synapses, respectively (Chubykin et al., 2007; Huang & Scheiffele, 2008). Indeed, in neuroligin-2 knockout mice, the number of symmetric inhibitory synapses (as determined by electron microscopy) is unaltered suggesting that neuroligin-2 deletion may impair the function of inhibitory synapses without decreasing their numbers (Blundell et al., 2008). This decrease in inhibitory synaptic function in neuroligin-2 deficient mice correlates with a marked increase in anxiety like behaviour (Blundell et al., 2008).

### 5.2. Dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) and dystrobrevin

A number of immuno-localisation and functional studies have implicated the dystrophin-glycoprotein complex (DGC) in the formation and function of a subset of inhibitory synapses (Knuesel et al., 1999; Knuesel et al., 2000; Brunig et al., 2002; Levi et al., 2002). In non-neuronal cells the DGC, a large multi protein complex containing at least 10 proteins (e.g. dystrophin, dystroglycan, utrophin, syntrophins, sarcoglycans and dystrobrevins), links the extracellular matrix to the intracellular cytoskeleton (Blake et al., 2002). A major component of the DGC is dystroglycan, a large protein composed of an extracellular α-subunit and transmembrane β-subunit, which are bound to each other on the cell surface and which are both derived from proteolytic cleavage of a single pre-cursor protein. Through its extracellular α-subunit domain dystroglycan can bind matrix proteins such agrin, laminin and perlcin in addition to neurexins. Through the intracellular domain of the β-subunit, dystroglycan can bind utrophin and a large >400 kDa cytoskeletal protein of the α-actinin/β-spectrin family called dystrophin which itself can bind dystrobrevins, syntrophin and the actin cytoskeleton (Blake et al., 2002). Mutations in many of the genes encoding components of the DGC (including dystrophin, α-, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan, α-dystrobrevin, laminin α2, and four enzymes that glycosylate dystroglycan) lead to muscular dystrophies in human or animal models (Blake et al., 2002).

In the CNS, a number of groups have demonstrated that DGC components (including α- and β-dystroglycan, long and short forms of dystrophin, syntrophin and α- and β-dystrobrevin) are localized to inhibitory postsynaptic domains (Levi et al., 2002). Both dystrophin mutant mdx mice and mice deleted for DGC components present a reduction in GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters (but not gephyrin) (Knuesel et al., 1999). A significant reduction in the amplitude and frequency of mIPSCs in Purkinje cells from mdx mutant mice has also been reported (Kueh et al., 2008). Furthermore, cerebellar Purkinje cells from double α- and β-dystrobrevin knockout mice have depleted synaptic dystrophin levels and reduced GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters leading to altered sensorimotor behaviours (Grady et al., 2006)suggesting that motor deficits observed in muscular dystrophy patients may also reflect alterations of synaptic inhibition in the CNS (Grady et al., 2006).

The DGC forms a stoichiometric complex with α- and β-neurexin in the CNS (Sugita et al., 2001). In a hippocampal cell culture model of inhibitory synapse formation where there is insufficient inhibitory terminal innervation, gephyrin and GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are mis-targeted and can be found opposed to glutamatergic terminals (Rao et al., 2000; Brunig et al., 2002; Christie et al., 2002; Studler et al., 2002). In contrast components of the DGC are not mis-targeted to glutamatergic synapses due to reduced inhibitory presynaptic input or in the absence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor γ2 subunits suggesting independent targeting mechanisms (Sugita et al., 2001; Brunig et al., 2002).

S-SCAM (synaptic scaffolding molecule) is a PDZ domain scaffold with 5 or 6 PDZ domains, a guanylate kinase domain and two WW domains and interacts with β-dystroglycan via its WW domains. Interestingly, S-SCAM can be found localised to inhibitory synapses (Sumita et al., 2007) and can also interact with neuroligin-2 via its WW domains and second PDZ domain to form a tripartite complex of S-SCAM, β-dystroglycan and neuroligin-2 suggesting that S-SCAM may function as a postsynaptic linker at inhibitory synapses between the DGC/neurexin complex and the neuroligin/neurexin complex. Neuroligin 2 and the DGC can be found localized to inhibitory synapses in the absence of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and gephyrin at cerebellar synapses of α1 subunit knockout mice (Patrizi et al., 2008). Thus at some synapses the DGC and neuroligins may act in concert as inhibitory synaptogenic molecules. It currently remains less clear whether cell adhesion molecules also play a role in regulating the surface and intracellular trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors but these results suggest that neuroligin 2 (and potentially the DGC) could act to recruit GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors to synapses and increase their residency time there (Dong et al., 2007; Huang & Scheiffele, 2008; Patrizi et al., 2008). Aggregating neuroligin-2 heterologously co-expressed with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors results in co-aggregation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors suggesting that these proteins may form tight surface complexes (Dong et al., 2007). This could be mediated in part by intracellular interactions between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and adhesion molecules via scaffolds or via extracellular interactions between the extracellular domains of adhesion molecules and the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor (Dong et al., 2007; Huang & Scheiffele, 2008). If high affinity interactions between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and neuroligins do exist at synapses, this could significantly affect GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor surface diffusion properties. It will also be intriguing to determine whether under some circumstances, neuroligins or DGC components can co-assemble with GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors within intracellular compartments and be co-trafficked to the plasma membrane and synapses.

## 6. Diffusion properties of cell surface GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors

Lateral diffusion within the plane of the plasma membrane has been demonstrated for several neurotransmitter receptors (Triller & Choquet, 2008). Studies using GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors containing an electrophysiological or fluorescent tag suggest that significant lateral mobility of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in the plasma membrane does occur (Jacob et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2005). Using a fluorescent bungarotoxin labeling approach it was also demonstrated that synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are recruited from their extrasynaptic counterparts (Bogdanov et al., 2006), in agreement with electrophysiological tagging studies (Thomas et al., 2005). Furthermore, fluorescent recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) imaging of GFP tagged GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors demonstrated that extrasynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors have higher levels of lateral mobility than their synaptic counterparts (Jacob et al., 2005). In agreement with these observations, single-particle tracking (SPT) studies with antibodies to the γ2 subunit extracellular domains have more recently demonstrated that single GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at mixed GABAergic/glycinergic synapses in

motor neuron cultures can rapidly exchange between synaptic and extrasynaptic compartments (Levi et al., 2008). Periods of fast GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mobility (diffusion coefficient of 0.2 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) correspond to Brownian movement in the lipid bilayer, whereas GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors can also be confined at postsynaptic sites with a diffusion coefficient of less than 0.03 μm<sup>2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> (Levi et al., 2008). Thus, like glycine receptors (Dahan et al., 2003), GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor movements display interspersed periods of low and high diffusion rates in the synaptic and extrasynaptic membrane, respectively (Levi et al., 2008; Renner et al., 2008). This retention of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors at inhibitory postsynaptic domains most likely results from the association of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with gephyrin clusters. While this has not yet been conclusively demonstrated for single receptors as has been done for glycine receptors, combined RNAi mediated gephyrin knockdown and FRAP imaging of GFP tagged GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors demonstrate that gephyrin plays a specific role in limiting the mobility of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor clusters (Jacob et al., 2005). The fact that this synaptic confinement of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors is reversible suggests that any postsynaptic gephyrin cluster can behave as both donor and/or acceptor sites for GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors as for glycine receptors (Renner et al., 2008). Interestingly, compared to glycine receptors, GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are found to have a weaker confinement at synaptic sites, to explore a larger area of the synaptic membrane and to escape synapses more easily. This may be due to the weaker apparent affinities of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors versus glycine receptors for gephyrin binding (Fritschy et al., 2008; Tretter et al., 2008). The dynamic regulation of interactions between GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors and scaffold molecules is likely to be a key mechanism for regulating synaptic receptor number during synaptic plasticity, or in homeostatic mechanisms setting the level of inhibition to that of excitation.

## 7. Concluding remarks

GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors play a key role in regulating neuronal excitability and information processing in the brain. A number of studies over the last two decades have used molecular, biochemical and genetic approaches to further our understanding of the biology of these receptors. The trafficking of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors from their assembly in the ER to the cell surface is a tightly regulated process highly dependent on several binding proteins. Trafficking of receptors through the secretory pathway as well as regulated endocytosis and endosomal sorting is key to regulating the number of synaptic receptors and the strength of synaptic inhibition. In addition, a number of proteins found enriched at inhibitory postsynaptic domains have been recently identified to be of major significance in the specification and validation of inhibitory synapses and are also likely to play key roles in regulating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor residency time at synapses. Finally, the post-translational modification of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors has been shown to play a role in modifying receptor function and trafficking, also contributing to alterations in synaptic strength. However, much work lies ahead to establish a detailed model of how the varying processes of receptor membrane dynamics and the formation of inhibitory postsynaptic domains are coordinated during development and in the adult, to regulate GABAergic transmission and to better understand how these processes may be disrupted in disease states.
