ABSTRACT

*Toxoplasma gondii* and other apicomplexan parasites are widely distributed obligate intracellular protozoa. A critical host mediator produced in response to *T. gondii* infection is IL-12. This cytokine is synthesized by dendritic cells, macrophages and neutrophils and plays a pivotal role in the production of IFN-γ, which in turn activates anti-microbial effector cells. In the past several years, many of the receptors and signaling pathways that link pathogen detection to induction of IL-12 have been identified and characterized. Among these receptors the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family can recognize all classes of pathogens and induce different types of immune responses. In the following review, I summarize the evidence for specific TLR function in host resistance to *T. gondii*.

1. Introduction

*Toxoplasma gondii* is one of the most widespread parasites with a broad host range including birds and mammals. *T. gondii* is an obligate intracellular protozoan pathogen within the phylum Apicomplexa [1]. Other members of this phylum include the human pathogens *Plasmodium* (the cause of malaria) and *Cryptosporidium* as well as the animal pathogens *Eimeria*, *Theileria*, and *Babesia* [2]. All Apicomplexans are intracellular parasites with a polarized cell structure and a complex cytoskeletal and organellar arrangement at their apical end essential for host cell invasion [3,4]. *T. gondii* infection can be clearly separated on two distinct stages: acute and chronic infections [1]. The acute stage is characterized by the rapidly growing form of the parasite called tachyzoites. In the infected animal, tachyzoites differentiate into bradyzoites, which can form tissue cysts predominantly in the central nervous system. The development of tissue cysts defines the chronic stage of the infection [1]. The population structure of *Toxoplasma* is dominated by three lineages, designated as strain types I, II, and III [5,6]. While strains of type I are uniformly lethal in mice prior to the establishment of cyst-associated persistence in the central nervous system (LD100 equals a single parasite), type II and III strains are less virulent (LD100 > 1000) and can establish chronic infections. The majority of the *T. gondii* infected individuals demonstrate mild symptoms and long-term complications are rare due to the rapid induction of a strong cell-mediated immune response [7]. Host resistance to *T. gondii* is critically dependent on interferon-γ (IFN-γ) produced by natural killer (NK) and T cells [8–12]. Interleukin-12 (IL-12) is the major cytokine triggering IFN-γ synthesis and IL-12p40 as well as IL-12p35 deficient mice succumb to acute toxoplasmosis with similar kinetics as IFN-γ-deficient animals [13–15]. Importantly, a strong IL-12, but not IL-23 response plays a major role for both early IFN-γ NK cell activation and Th1 induction and maintenance during the course of the infection [15].

The identification of IL-12 as a key cytokine that links innate and adaptive immune system has substantially clarified our understanding of the initial events during host-pathogen interactions. Importantly, this finding raised a crucial question about the nature of the microbial products that trigger the release of IL-12 from innate immune cells, including DC, macrophages and neutrophils. The answer to this question came from identification of the receptors and signaling pathways regulating IL-12 response to *T. gondii* [16]. In a broader picture, the use of the *T. gondii* infection model allows us to identify the key elements regulating innate and adaptive immune responses.

2. MyD88 and *Toxoplasma gondii*: on the track to TLR recognition

The discovery that TLR4 can initiate the NF-kB inflammatory program in the presence of LPS, an essential component of Gram-negative bacteria, suggested that TLRs recognize conserved

chemical structures called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [17,18]. Indeed, many bacterial and viral PAMPs have now been characterized and their respective TLRs identified. For example, TLR2 functions via recognition of lipopeptides/lipoproteins from Gram-positive bacteria and several TLRs are involved in the recognition of nucleic acids: double and single stranded RNA (TLR3 and TLR7) and CpG motifs of DNA (TLR9) all of which are important for virus detection [19,20]. Despite significant progress in understanding how TLRs function in recognition of bacteria and viruses, mechanisms for parasite recognition were not clear.

All TLRs contain extracellular leucine-rich repeats responsible for the recognition of pathogens, and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic Toll/interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) domains essential for intracellular signaling [21]. The TLR-mediated signaling in response to almost all pathogens is initiated by TIR-domain-dependent activation of an adaptor protein MyD88 [21–23]. The MyD88 protein is thought to play a central role in TLR signaling since innate immune cells isolated from MyD88 deficient mice failed to produce inflammatory cytokines, including IL-12, when activated with TLRs agonists [20,24–26]. To directly examine if MyD88 is required for host resistance to the eukaryotic pathogen *T. gondii*, Scanga et al. infected MyD88$--$ mice with the ME49 parasite strain (type II) and monitored survival of these animals. MyD88$--$ mice failed to control acute *T. gondii* infection and the mortality kinetics closely resembled the phenotype of IL-12p40$--$ mice infected with the parasite [27]. A dramatic increase in parasite load seen in MyD88$--$ animals was also independently reported by Yano and colleagues [28]. Most importantly, Scanga et al. examined if MyD88 controlled the IL-12 responsiveness of dendritic cells (DC), macrophages and neutrophils to *T. gondii*. It was found that the IL-12 response was greatly impaired in neutrophils stimulated with either live tachyzoites or their extract STAg (soluble tachyzoites antigens). Similar results were obtained with macrophages stimulated with the parasite extract [27]. Later studies with live parasites revealed a more complex picture. Surprisingly, when live RH tachyzoites (type I strain) were used to stimulate macrophages, it was found that IL-12 release did not require MyD88. At the same time, IL-12 production in response to ME49 tachyzoites (type II strain), was largely but incompletely dependent on the MyD88 adaptor [29]. An even more complex scenario was observed with DC. It was postulated that DC IL-12 production is controlled by two independent signaling pathways relying on the chemokine receptor CCR5 and MyD88 [30]. This hypothesis was formulated based on the observation that DC IL-12 response to the parasite extract STAg was only partially dependent on the MyD88 pathway [31]. Moreover, it was shown that a *T. gondii*-derived 18 kD cyclophilin named C-18 was capable of initiating CCR5-dependent but MyD88-independent IL-12 production from splenic DC [32]. While it is not surprising that different host signaling pathways contribute to innate recognition of *T. gondii*, MyD88 activation is clearly a critical step in the initiation of the IL-12-dependent response to *T. gondii* [16,27].

of *T. gondii* molecule(s) responsible for the induction of IL-12 secretion by DC was not clear. Since the ability of *T. gondii* to trigger DC IL-12 production can be completely eliminated by proteinase K treatment [33], it was logical to assume that the IL-12 inducing factor is likely to be a protein. By means of a combination of traditional biochemical techniques, a low molecular weight molecule was isolated from STAg that potently stimulated IL-12 production by DC in MyD88-dependent manner [34]. Mass spectrometry analysis identified this protein as a *T. gondii* profilin. Most importantly, in a dose-response analysis the cloned recombinant *T. gondii* profilin was more active than unfractionated STAg in the range of several orders. Taken together, these experiments suggested that *T. gondii* profilin is a major IL-12 inducing molecule present in the parasite [34]. The receptor for this molecule was identified using two different approaches. By the use of transfected cell lines, it was observed that profilin can interact with TLR11, but not with other tested TLRs. Moreover, when splenic DCs from TLR11$--$ mice were stimulated with profilin, STAg or live parasites they failed to produce IL-12p40, TNF, or IL-6. Taken together, these results identify TLR11 as an innate immune receptor for *T. gondii* profilin that is required for DC IL-12 production in vitro and in vivo [34].

TLRs recognize conserved molecules that perform an essential functions in microorganisms. TLR ligands thus function as ‘molecular signatures’ for a class of pathogens [35,36]. Identification of *T. gondii* profilin as a TLR11 ligand raised several important questions. First, does TLR11 function as a general pattern-recognition receptor for apicomplexan parasites or was it originally an innate immune receptor for other classes of pathogens that was hijacked by *T. gondii* in order to induce self-limiting host response against itself? This question was raised based on the observation that TLR11 was shown to recognize uropathogenic bacteria [37]. Moreover, the concept that *T. gondii* is a successful benign pathogen that deliberately balances the host proinflammatory response is extremely popular, although experimental support for this hypothesis is currently lacking. Second, what is the biological function of profilin in the life cycle of *T. gondii*? Profilins are small actin-binding proteins that in other eukaryotic cells regulate actin polymerization [38]. There are several essential actin-dependent steps that *T. gondii* tachyzoites must complete in order to survive: gliding and spreading on the surface of the host cell layer, host cell invasion, intracellular growth and egress [39]. Until recently, the function of profilin in *T. gondii* was not clear.

We have recently established that *T. gondii* is not unique in triggering TLR11, but rather is one member of a family of apicomplexan parasites that express profilins capable of activating this TLR and inducing IL-12 production. Moreover, non-apicomplexan profilins, including those isolated from other protozoan parasites, did not activate TLR11. These results establish TLR11 as a pattern-recognition receptor for apicomplexan protozoa through its recognition of a conserved family of profilin molecules present in these intracellular pathogens (Allison M. Campbell, Hyun S. Lillehoj, Alan Sher, and F.Y., manuscript submitted). By conditional disruption of the profilin gene Soldati and colleagues formally demonstrated that while *T. gondii* profilin is not required for parasite growth and replication, it is necessary for gliding, invasion and egress of the parasite. Moreover, *T. gondii* profilin is essential for the parasite virulence in vivo [40]. It is intriguing that in addition to TLR11 the other major TLR that interacts with proteins, TLR5, recognizes highly conserved structural motifs on flagellin, a protein required for bacterial movement [41,42]. Taken together, the results suggest that microbial motility-related functions are important targets for TLR recognition.

Another crucial issue concerns the in vivo function of TLR11 during infection with *T. gondii*. Much of what we currently know about the interaction of DCs with the parasite is limited to the

### 3. TLR11 plays a central role in recognition of *T. gondii*

Despite the importance of MyD88 in regulation of IL-12, it was not clear what innate immune receptor(s) may be involved in triggering MyD88 activation in response to *T. gondii*. An initial screen with two obvious candidates, TLR2 and TLR4, was unsuccessful. Dendritic cells isolated from mice deficient in either of these receptors showed unimpaired IL-12 response to the parasite arguing against a major role for these receptors in the regulation of MyD88-dependent IL-12 response to the parasite [27]. Additional screening with a panel of TLR3, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9 deficient animals failed to identify a single receptor involved in *T. gondii* recognition (F.Y., unpublished observations). Moreover, the nature
studies with injected parasite extract STAg, which contains a complex mixture of *T. gondii* antigens but lack the ability to mimic the infection steps [43]. Interestingly, when WT mice were immunized with STAg, profilin was found to be a dominant antigen in the CD4+ T-cell response to *T. gondii* [44]. Moreover, this response was completely ablated in mice deficient in TLR11 or MyD88. It was further established that CD4+ T cell priming in response to *T. gondii* was initiated by CD8+ DC subset [44]. These results are intriguing since this DC subset is known to be the major source of IL-12 in response to *T. gondii* [43,34,45]. On the molecular level, it was shown that responsiveness to this parasite protein was regulated at the level of antigen presentation by DC and required both TLR11 signaling and major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II recognition acting in cis [44]. While these findings support a major influence of TLR recognition on antigen presentation by DC in vivo, once infected with *T. gondii*, DCs may behave differently and further studies are required to understand more completely the fate of DC and T cells in TLR11−/− mice infected with the parasite. Indeed, it was shown that while *T. gondii* infected TLR11-deficient mice displayed dramatically reduced serum IL-12 levels and developed more brain cysts in the chronic phase of infection, TLR11−/−, in contrast to MyD88−/− animals, survived the acute phase of the infection [34]. T cell responses in these experiments were not addressed. The above findings argued that while TLR11 plays a major role in IL-12-dependent control of *T. gondii* infection other MyD88-dependent TLR/IL-1 family members are likely to also contribute to generation of host resistance to this protozoan pathogen.

### 4. TLR2 contribution to host response to *Toxoplasma gondii*

TLR2 can be activated by a wide variety of microbial components. These include lipoproteins from various pathogens, peptidoglycan and lipoteichoic acid from Gram-positive bacteria, and zymosan from fungi [19]. The realization that TLR2 plays a fundamental role in the initiation of immune responses to various groups of pathogens lead to a hypothesis that a similar recognition system may function for sensing parasites. The role for this TLR was initially established for the protozoan parasites Leishmania [46,47] and *Trypanosoma cruzi* [48,49]. In the case of *T. gondii*, several independent groups investigated a role for TLR2 in parasite recognition and established that while TLR2 deficient mice display normal IL-12 production and host resistance to *T. gondii* infection at conventional doses, TLR2 signaling plays a non-redundant role when animals are challenged with higher infectious doses [27,50]. It was shown that all TLR2 deficient mice died within 10 days after infection with 300 cysts, where the lower dose of the parasite resulted in 100% survival of TLR2−/− animals [50]. While the non-essential role of TLR2 in regulation of IL-12 is likely explained by a dominant role for TLR11 in the induction of the DC IL-12 response and the central role for these APC in controlling the initial cytokine response to the parasite [34], susceptibility of the TLR2−/− mice to *T. gondii* revealed the complex nature of TLR signaling in different innate immune cells. While TLR2 deficient DC and neutrophils are indistinguishable from WT counterparts in terms of IL-12 production [27], macrophage activation strictly depends on TLR2 activation by the parasite [51]. Yano and colleagues observed that TLR2 regulates *T. gondii* induced NO production [50]. A central role for NO as the primary toxoplasmacidal mediator of activated macrophages has been established from studies employing NO synthase inhibitors and iNOS−/− animals [52–55]. Nevertheless, iNOS−/− mice are able to control the acute infection [55] and additional effector mechanisms are likely controlled by TLR2. For example, this receptor was recently shown to regulate the *T. gondii*-induced production of the neutrophil attracting chemokine CCL2 [51]. This observation is relevant because of the known involvement of neutrophils in host

resistance to the parasite [56–58]. On a broader level it is intriguing that despite similarities in MyD88-dependent TLR signaling pathway, the major outcome of TLR ligation is distinct. While TLR11 primarily controls an IL-12-dependent arm of the host defense, TLR2 is involved in regulation of the CCL2 and TNF production in response to the parasite [34,51]. These data are consistent with a pioneer observation of Vogel and Sher that *T. gondii* contains distinct factors responsible for the induction of TNF and IL-12 [33,59]. The definitive ligand for TLR2 appears to be the core glycans and the diacylglycerols isolated from purified *T. gondii* GPI [60]. These data are in agreement with the finding from the related apicomplexan parasite *Plasmodium falciparum*, since malaria GPI recognition is mediated mainly through TLR2 [61,62].

### 5. Other TLRs: understanding a complex role of Toll-like receptor signaling in susceptibility to *T. gondii* infection

In an elegant study utilizing in vivo bioluminescence imaging Barragan and colleagues investigated the dynamics of *T. gondii* infection in a panel of mice deficient in TLR signaling in comparison with the MyD88−/− mice. Their data confirmed that MyD88 is essential for the control of the parasite growth. In addition, they have observed similar resistance in mice deficient in TLR2, TLR1 and TLR6 [63]. These results stimulated an additional search for innate immune receptors that can be involved in a cooperative regulation of the innate immune response against *T. gondii*.

Two additional TLRs were implicated in host resistance to the parasite. First, purified *T. gondii* GPI triggers TLR4 signaling pathways [60]. Moreover, mice deficient in both TLR2 and TLR4, but not in TLR2 alone showed completely abrogation of TNF production in response to GPI. These results suggest that TLR4 may cooperate with TLR2 during *T. gondii* infection [60]. Using a different approach it has been shown that *T. gondii*-derived heat shock protein 70 stimulates maturation of murine bone marrow-derived DC via TLR4 [64]. Since mice deficient in TLR4 showed only minimal enhancement in susceptibility to the parasite infection, this receptor is unlikely to play a significant role in *T. gondii* recognition [27,50]. Nevertheless, an important but indirect effect of this TLR on small intestinal inflammation following per oral *T. gondii* infection was revealed [65]. It was noticed that oral infection with the parasite is accompanied by a substantial overgrowth of commensals in the ileum leading to severe immunopathology. Lack of TLR4 prevented *T. gondii* induced ileitis [65]. Similar results were reported in TLR9−/− animals [66]. It was shown that TLR9 deficient mice are relatively resistant to the ileitis following oral infection with the parasite. Interestingly enough, a reduced Th1 response to the parasite in the small intestine and lamina propria was observed [66]. These results may lead to the conclusion that TLR9 is directly involved in the recognition of *T. gondii*. Indeed, several apicomplexan parasites can activate this innate immune receptor. The defined apicomplexan parasite ligands for TLR9 include genomic DNA from *Babesia* and hemozoin from *Plasmodium falciparum* [67,68]. In contrast to these pathogens, our results utilizing either TLR9 transfectants or TLR9 deficient cells suggested that *T. gondii* does not trigger TLR9 activation (FY, unpublished observations). Thus, the reduced immune response to the parasite in TLR4 and TLR9 deficient animals is explained rather by reduced ‘adjuvant’ effects provided by commensals. These results added even more complexity to our current understanding of the *T. gondii* pathogenesis and demonstrate both the importance and the difficulty of performing analysis of host resistance to pathogens.

to *T. gondii* (Table 1). As discussed above, lack of multiple TLRs on innate immune cells did not recapitulate the phenotype of MyD88--/-- animals [27,34]. These results implicate that MyD88 functions may not be limited to the innate immune receptors and this adaptor protein can also be involved in the regulation of T cell responses as well [69,70]. Furthermore, while TLRs play a major role in microbial recognition, other pattern-recognition receptors may be involved in host resistance to *T. gondii*. Both their identification and mechanisms of cooperation with TLRs are important directions for the future research. Indeed, a MyD88-independent innate response to *T. gondii* parasite has been recently reported [71,72]. Studies addressing those issues would certainly fuel our knowledge in the area of innate immunity.
