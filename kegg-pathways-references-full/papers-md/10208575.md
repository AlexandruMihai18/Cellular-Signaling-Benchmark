Introduction  

The suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) is the main  
circadian oscillator in mammals. The molecular and  
biochemical mechanisms involved in its pacemaker  
function are mostly unknown. Recent reports have  
shown that calcium ions play an important role in  
the rhythmicity of biological clocks. The normal  
firing pattern and the circadian rhythm of the firing  
rate of SCN neurons, as well as the oscillation of 2-  
deoxyglucose uptake by the SCN, are Ca²⁺-depen-  
dent processes [1]. The SCN shows synchronous  
neural activity in absence of active Ca²⁺-dependent  
synaptic transmission [2], and blockade of voltage-  
gated calcium channels during the subjective day has  
no effect on the phase of the circadian rhythm of the  
firing rate of SCN neurons in rats [3] and hamsters  
[4]. This suggests that calcium-dependent synaptic  
transmission is not essential to sustain the endogen-  
ous SCN clock mechanism. On the other hand,  
rhythmicity in the SCN could be associated with  
variations in intracellular calcium  
concentration ([Ca²⁺]i). Shibata and Moore [5] reported that  

calmodulin inhibitors produce phase shifts of circa-  
dian rhythms *in vivo* (hamsters) and *in vitro* (rats).  
Van den Pol *et al.* [6] showed that glutamate and  
serotonin can elicit cytoplasmic [Ca²⁺]i oscillations  
in SCN neurons and glia even in the absence of  
extracellular Ca²⁺, suggesting that the stimulus in-  
duced Ca²⁺ mobilization derives mainly from intra-  
cellular stores. Also, the induction of a number of  
immediate-early genes including c-fos and phos-  
phorylation of the transcription factor cAMP re-  
sponse element binding protein (CREB), are Ca²⁺-  
dependent processes that take place in the SCN  
upon light stimulation [7].  

Intracellular calcium stores in the endoplasmic  
reticulum play a key role in the dynamic of [Ca²⁺]i.  
Thapsigargin-sensitive Mg²⁺-Ca²⁺-ATPase, are re-  
sponsible for the Ca²⁺ uptake into the stores, and  
the Ca²⁺ release depends on channels termed ryan-  
dine and inositol (1,4,5)-triphosphate (IP₃) receptors  
(RyRs and IP₃-Rs, respectively). Both receptors are  
high conductance Ca²⁺ release channels that can be  
modulated allosterically by a variety of ligands  
including Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, calmodulin and ATP [8].

NeuroReport

Three distinct isoforms of ryanodine receptors have been cloned and termed type 1 (RyR-1), type 2 (RyR-2) and type 3 (RyR-3), respectively [9]. Recently, the three RyR isoforms have been identified in the brain [10], but by far the most abundant isoform is RyR-2 [9].

To study the role of \([Ca^{2+}]\) dynamics in the oscillatory mechanism of the SCN, we addressed the question of whether the properties of intracellular calcium release channels may undergo a circadian modulation and whether it has some role in determining the rhythmic output of the SCN.

Materials and Methods

For receptor studies adult male Wistar rats weighing 100–120 g were housed in groups of five and kept for at least 3 weeks in a controlled 12:12 h illumination cycle with free access to food and water. Lights (350 lux) were turned on either at 08.00 h (regular LD cycle) or at 20.00 h (reversed cycle). For electrophysiological experiments, male golden hamsters (LVG, Charles River; 1–3 months of age) were housed in a room under a light:dark schedule of 14:10 h (lights on at 06:00 h). In all cases, lights off in the animal room was designated ZT 12.

Animals were beheaded under the corresponding light conditions, their brain was quickly removed and placed in ice cold Krebs-phosphate solution, the SCN was dissected according to Aguilar-Roblero et al. [11]. Other brain areas, such as the anterior hypothalamus, the parietal cortex, the hippocampus and the cerebellum, were dissected according to Loscher et al. [12]. The tissue was immediately frozen with dry ice and stored in plastic tubes at –70°C until further processing. For biochemical determinations, the different brain areas were homogenized by sonication according to Hamilton et al. [13]. The homogenized tissue was used as source of membranes in the radioligand binding experiments.

We first addressed whether intracellular calcium channels, RyR and IP₃R, showed diurnal fluctuations. Eight sets of 10 animals were killed at 3 h intervals starting at ZT 1 to complete a 24 h cycle. For reasons of convenience, all the dissections were made between 09.00 h and 18.00 h (local time) from animals entrained either to the regular or the reversed LD cycle. Binding essays for \({}^{[3]}\)H]RyR (according to Hamilton et al. [13]) and \({}^{[3]}\)H]IP₃R (according to Furuichi et al. [14]) were then accomplished in the different brain regions previously mentioned, using the ligands in the range of the reported Kd for each neuronal receptor (5 nM \({}^{[3]}\)H]Ryanodine, 84 Ci/mmol; 3 nM \({}^{[3]}\)H]IP₃, 30 Ci/ mmol). In all binding experiments, non-specific

binding was defined by the addition of \(10 \mu M\) ryanodine or \(5 \mu M\) IP₃. Linear analysis (ANOVA test) was used to detect differences in the temporal pattern of the data, post-hoc comparisons were made by the Duncan multiple range test with an α level set at 0.05.

We then addressed whether the diurnal fluctuation in the \({}^{[3]}\)H]ryanodine binding found in the SCN was maintained under constant dim red light (DD) to test the independence of the rhythm from environmental clues. All animals were entrained for 3 weeks to a normal or to a reversed LD cycle, and then kept in constant red dim light (50 lux) for 3 days. Eight sets of 10 animals were killed at 3 h intervals starting at local time 09.00 h (approximate circadian time (CT) 1, by convention the time of activity onset is designated CT 12) to complete a 24 h cycle. \({}^{[3]}\)H]Ryanodine binding assay was then accomplished for SCN membranes. The above experiments were replicated five times.

In a third experiment we addressed whether \({}^{[3]}\)H]ryanodine binding circadian rhythmicity was due to changes in the affinity (Kd) or in the number of receptors (Bmax). Animals were entrained for 3 weeks to a normal or a reversed LD cycle. Two sets of 40 animals were killed; one at the peak (ZT 4–7) and one at the trough (ZT 16–19), and their SCN removed. Saturation isotherms of \({}^{[3]}\)H]ryanodine binding were then performed in the SCN membranes in the presence of 0.5–200 nM \({}^{[3]}\)H]ryanodine.

The next experiment was aimed at exploring the nature of the RyR presenting circadian oscillations in the SCN, and to confirm the increased binding sites to \({}^{[3]}\)H]ryanodine during the peak of the rhythm. As in previous experiments, animals were entrained to normal or reversed LD cycles for at least 3 weeks. Two sets of 25 animals each were processed from ZT 4:00 to 7:00 (peak) and from ZT 16:00 to 19:00 (trough) and the SCN was obtained. RyR protein present in the SCN was determined by Western blot analysis using a specific antibody raised against RyR-2 [15] following the method described by Dent et al. [16]. This and the previous experiment were replicated four times.

The fifth experiment was directed to evaluate the main cellular type in the SCN that embodied the RyR-2. Nine rats were killed during the peak of \({}^{[3]}\)H]ryanodine binding (ZT 04.00–07.00 h) and their brains prepared for immunohistochemical analysis as described previously [17]. Coronal sections (40 μm) containing the SCN were serially collected in phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.6) in four sets, and one was processed for double immunofluorescence. The tissue was first incubated simultaneously (72 h at 4°C) with the primary antibodies against RyR-2 (1:1000, raised in rabbit) and GFAP conjugated to

Cy3 (1:400, mouse monoclonal, SIGMA C9205). RyR-2 immunoreactivity was revealed by further incubating the tissue with biotinylated goat anti-Rabbit-IgG (1:200), and then with Avidin conjugated to FITC (1:200) each for 2 h at room temperature. No further processing was necessary for GFAP. Immunoreactivity was first evaluated in a fluorescence microscope, and further analyzed by confocal microscopy.

The scanning head of a Bio-Rad MRC 1024 confocal microscope was coupled to an inverted microscope with Fluor ×40 and ×20 (1.3 NA) objectives. The iris aperture was set at 30% of its maximum, providing an axial (z) resolution of about 2 μm and a lateral resolution of about 0.5 μm. Illumination was provided by a Kr/Ar laser. The excitation wavelength was selected using interference filters (488 and 560 nm). The emitted light was filtered at 520 and 580 nm, and detected by separate photomultiplier tubes allowing simultaneous dual emission measurements for FITC and Cy3, respectively. Image acquisition was performed by using MLP-1024 software and captured images (Kalman average n=9) were contrast-enhanced and merged using the Confocal assistant 4.02 software developed by Todd Clark (Department of Cell Biology and Neuroanatomy, University of Minnesota).

The final experiment was aimed at evaluating the functional relevance of the RyR calcium channels in SCN neuronal firing rhythm. Ten hamsters were euthanized between ZT 2 and 4. Hypothalamic slices (400–500 μm) containing the SCN were placed in a gas-fluid interface slice continuously bathed (1 ml/min) in artificial cerebrospinal fluid (pH 7.4) supplemented with an antibiotic (gentamicin, 50 mg/l) and a fungicide (amphotericin, 2 mg/l), and maintained at 34.5°C with warm, humidified 95% oxygen/5% carbon dioxide. Ryanodine (10 μM, n=3) or caffeine (10 μM, n=4) was applied in the bath between ZT 5.5 and 6.5. The spontaneous firing rate (measured for 1 min) from control slices (n=3) and experimental slices were recorded from ZT 1 to 8 on the second day by an experimenter blind to all treatments. Data were smoothed by 1 h running means with a 15 min lag. The time corresponding to the maximum of the smoothed data was used as the time of the peak firing. Phase shifts were measured relative to the average time of peak firing of control slices.


Results

Specific [³H]ryanodine binding to SCN membranes from rats held in a 12:12 h light:dark cycle (LD) showed an overall mean value over the 24 h period of 285 ± 52 fmol/mg protein. As shown in Fig. 1A,

[³H]ryanodine binding to SCN membranes exhibits a 24 h rhythm with peak values at ZT 4 and ZT 7, and trough values between ZT 19 and 22. No brain area other than the SCN presented significant variations in their temporal pattern throughout the 24 h cycle. Nevertheless, the total amount of [³H]ryanodine binding sites varied according to the cerebral structure examined. The overall mean values over the 24 h light:dark cycle, were (in fmol/mg protein): parietal cortex 162 ± 29, dorsal hypothalamus 199 ± 25, hippocampus 291 ± 43; cerebellum 176 ± 30.

Mean specific binding [³H]IP₃ throughout the 24 h period differed, depending on the cerebral structure examined. The overall mean values over the 24 h light:dark cycle, were (in pmol/mg protein): SCN 4.12 ± 1.17, parietal cortex 2.08 ± 0.32, dorsal hypothalamus 4.20 ± 0.53, hippocampus 6.36 ± 0.97 and cerebellum 13.16 ± 2.09. However, in contrast to [³H]ryanodine binding, none of the brain regions studied, including the SCN, showed significant circadian variations.

The rhythm of [³H]ryanodine binding to SCN membranes obtained from animals held for 3 days in continuous darkness is shown in Fig. 1B. The overall mean value of specific [³H]ryanodine binding is of the same order as that observed in LD, but the amplitude of the rhythm decreased compared with animals under LD. Furthermore, the peak values of the rhythm shifted to earlier hours.

A Scatchard plot analysis derived from data collected at the peak and the trough of the rhythm is shown in Fig. 1C. A 2.3-fold increase in B_max occurred at the peak compared with the trough (n = 4; 718 ± 16 and 322 ± 12 fmol/mg protein, respectively). In contrast, the Kd values determined from the same plot were not significantly different in the two conditions (4.65 ± 0.22 nM at the peak and 4.9 ± 0.23 nM at the trough). The Hill coefficient determined at either times of the rhythm (peak, 0.97; trough, 1.06) is consistent with the recognition of a single population of receptors with a 1:1 stoichiometry. In accord with the [³H]ryanodine binding experiments, western blot showed an elevated expression of RyR-2 in SCN proteins during the peak of the rhythm compared with the trough (Fig. 1D, representative of four replicates).

Confocal microscopy of SCN preparations double labelled by immunohistochemistry against RyR-2 and GFAP revealed clearly distinct staining patterns, suggesting two independent cellular populations. RyR-2 immunoreactivity in the SCN (Fig. 2A) was intense and clearly distinguishable from GFAP immunoreactivity (Fig. 2B). Both types of immunoreactive cells were found throughout the extent of the nuclei with no regional distribution. RyR-2

labelling was present only in neuronal somata and dendrites. None of the GFAP-immunoreactive cells showed RyR-2 immunoreactivity (Fig. 2C,D).

The spontaneous electrical activity of hamster SCN slices *in vitro* was examined one day after vehicle or drug administration at different times. Control slices (Fig. 3A) receiving either no application or application of ACSF at ZT 6 showed peak firing rate between ZT 5.95 and ZT 6.7 on the subsequent day *in vitro* (*n* = 3 mean time of peak firing ± s.e.m., 6.3 ± 0.2 h). An application of ryanodine to the bath (10 μM, 1 h) at ZT 5.5–6.5 on the first day *in vitro* induced a long-term modification in the circadian clock (Fig. 3B) such that the time of peak firing occurred between ZT 2.3 and 3.1 on the second day *in vitro* (*n* = 3, mean phase shift 3.6 ± 0.2). Similar to the effects of ryanodine, a bath application of caffeine (10 μM, 1 h) induced a phase advance of the time of peak firing on day 2 (*n* = 4, mean phase shift 2.1 ± 0.8). Due to the time the recording began and the use of 1 h moving average, slight underestimate of the magnitude of the shifts may have occurred.

### Discussion

In our studies both types of intracellular calcium release channels were present in all brain areas studied. The differences in the levels of specific binding reflect the regional expression of these proteins, as previously reported by immunohistochemistry and *in situ* hybridization studies [10,16]. Only the expression of RyR in the SCN showed significant temporal variation. This observation suggests that the SCN maintains a distinct temporal control of RyR expression. In contrast no diurnal variation of IP₃R expression was detected in any brain structure studied (including the SCN). The endogenous (circadian) nature of the fluctuations of RyR expression, demonstrated by the persistence of this rhythm in constant darkness, suggests that the control of RyR expression in the SCN might be related to the clock mechanism or its output.

Assuming a similar fractional occupancy of their respective receptors at the concentration of ligand used here, our data from specific binding assays in

the SCN indicate that IP₃Rs are 8-fold more abundant than RyRs. This might suggest a less significant contribution of RyR to calcium signaling of these cells. However, previous studies in neurons from sympathetic ganglia have shown that although the IP₃R/RyRs ratio is close to 6, activation of the RyR by caffeine stimulation, is able to contribute up to 40% of the total cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ signal [18]. This strongly suggest that in spite of its relatively lower abundance in the SCN, the RyRs could still be playing a significant role in the intracellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis.

Scatchard analysis indicate that the rhythm of [³H] ryanodine binding found in the SCC is due to an increment in the number of receptors, and not to changes in the affinity for ryanodine. Furthermore, immunoblotting experiments showed that the type 2 isoform of the RyR (the most abundant isoform in the CNS), is involved in these circadian variations. Since [³H] ryanodine binding assays were performed using total SCN membrane extracts, the possibility that the change in B_max could be due to different localization and/or to the exchange of RyRs in several cellular compartments can be ruled out.

the slice bath for 1 h around CT 6. On the other hand, recent findings by Ding *et al.* [19] indicate the role of RyRs in the entrainment mechanism of the SCN to light, particularly in the signal transduction downstream glutamate during early subjective night. It is worth to notice that in this latter study, no phase shift was induced with a brief stimulation of the RyRs by a 1 mM caffeine microdrop applied directly into the rat SCN at CT 6. The apparent discrepancy with present results may be due to the different species used, or to the fact that 1 h administration of caffeine at the dose employed induces depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ storage by continuous stimulation of the RyRs. At present, it is not known whether other elements involved in regulating the intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamics in the SCN, besides the RyR-2, such as voltage-gated Ca²⁺ channels from plasma membrane, Ca²⁺-ATPases or Ca²⁺ transport, exhibit similar temporal variations.

## Conclusion

We report a circadian rhythm specific for the SCN in one of the key elements involved in \[Ca²⁺\]i homeostasis, namely the ryanodine receptor type 2. Our data provide further evidence that control of the \[Ca²⁺\]i dynamics may play a central role in determining the rhythmic output from the major mammalian circadian pacemaker.
