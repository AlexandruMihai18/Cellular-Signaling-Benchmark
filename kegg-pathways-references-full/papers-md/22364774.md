## ABSTRACT

The mineralocorticoid hormone aldosterone is synthesized in the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. Glomerulosa cells respond to the physiological stimuli, elevated extracellular [K⁺] and angiotensin II, with an intracellular Ca²⁺ signal. Cytosolic Ca²⁺ facilitates the transport of the steroid-precursor cholesterol to mitochondria and, after a few hours, it also induces the transcription of aldosterone synthase. Therefore, the cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal is regarded as the most important short and long-term mediator of aldosterone secretion. However, cytosolic Ca²⁺ is also taken up by mitochondria and, in turn, the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ response activates mitochondrial dehydrogenases resulting in stimulation of respiration and increase in reduced pyridine nucleotides. Since both cholesterol side-chain cleavage and all of the hydroxylation steps of steroid synthesis require NADPH as a cofactor, the importance of cytosolic Ca²⁺ - mitochondrial Ca²⁺ coupling and of appropriate NADPH supply in respect to hormone production can be assumed. However, the importance of the mitochondrial factors has been neglected so far. Here, after summarizing earlier findings we provide new results obtained through modifying mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake by knocking down p38 MAPK or OPA1 and overexpressing S100G, supporting the notion that mitochondrial Ca²⁺ and reduced pyridine nucleotides are facilitating factors for both basal and stimulated steroid production.

## 1. The physiological control of aldosterone biosynthesis

Aldosterone is a steroid hormone secreted by the outermost zone, the zona glomerulosa of the adrenal cortex. It controls sodium and potassium balance of the organism and therefore it is a vital factor in the vertebrate organism. Its long-known although not sole targets are the epithelial cells, including those of the distal nephron where aldosterone amplifies Na⁺ reabsorption and K⁺ and H⁺ secretion. The hormone influences the function of the cardiovascular system, not only via salt-water balance but also through direct actions on the heart, blood vessels and the central nervous system. Its secretion is stimulated by sodium and/or fluid depletion, hyperkalaemia (due to physical exercise, dietary potassium loading, tissue damage or renal insufficiency) and stress. Not surprisingly, the number of humoral factors claimed to stimulate or inhibit its secretion exceeds 30 [1]. The major physiological stimuli of hormone secretion are angiotensin II, extracellular K⁺ and ACTH, although the effect of ACTH is restricted to a few hours [1,2].

The significance of atrial natriuretic hormone in the inhibition of hormone secretion has also been established. Although there is no doubt that Ca²⁺ is the major signal transducer that induces both acute and long-term responses, the final response is also modulated by other transducing elements, including PKC, cAMP and cGMP, MAP kinases, prostanoid derivatives etc. [1]. Under acute conditions the effect of these factors finally converge on the supply of cholesterol to mitochondria, thus facilitating its conversion to pregnenolone [3] and increasing steroid substrate supply to consecutive enzymatic steps. In addition, stimulation for hours or days enhances expression of protein, including aldosterone synthase [4,5].

The precursor of steroid hormones is cholesterol, stored in esterified form in special lipid droplets. In all steroid producing cells, cholesterol esters are hydrolyzed upon stimulation by cell-specific agonists, free cholesterol is formed and transported to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM). This transport, a limiting factor of steroid hormone synthesis [6] is followed by two hydroxylation steps and the subsequent cleavage of the C₂₇ molecule to the C₂₁ pregnenolone. Both reactions are catalyzed by the mitochondrial cytochrome P450$_{scc}$ enzyme (encoded by CYP11A1). Pregnenolone leaves the mitochondria and is further transformed by microsomal reactions, Δ⁵,3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase, and 21-hydroxylase, and in the adrenocortical inner zones of many

species (though not the glomerulosa) 17-hydroxylase as well. In the adrenal cortex the newly formed pregn-4-ene steroids re-enter the mitochondria, where the final biochemical steps are zone-specific. In glomerulosa cells aldosterone synthase (cytochrome P450<sub>aldo</sub>), the protein encoded by CYP11B2, produces aldosterone whereas in the deeper cortical zones 11β-hydroxylase (cytochrome P450<sub>β</sub>), the product of CYP11B1, is responsible for the production of the glucocorticoid hormone cortisol (or corticosterone in the rat) [7,8]. (Androgen synthesis from pregnenolone in the zona reticularis requires only microsomal reactions.)

Whereas NADPH utilized for the microsomal 21-hydroxylation of the intermediary product progesterone is produced in the pentose phosphate pathway, NADPH used for mitochondrial reactions (conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone and deoxycorticosterone to aldosterone) is formed in the organelle by transhydrogenation from NADH [9,10]. It should be noted that electrons required by P450<sub>scc</sub> and P450<sub>aldo</sub> are provided not directly by reduced pyridine nucleotides but transferred to the enzyme through the mitochondrial NADPH – adrenodoxin reductase – adrenodoxin (isoform Fdx1 [11]) system. Chronic Na<sup>+</sup> withdrawal and dietary K<sup>+</sup> load have both been reported to increase adrenodoxin protein levels in rat zona glomerulosa [12] suggesting that the appropriate electron supply for the mitochondrial hydroxylases is an important factor for aldosterone synthesis.

Steroidogenic reactions in the mitochondria may be a considerable source of oxygen-derived free radicals (ROS) [13,14] and may call for the high antioxidant content of the adrenal cortex [15]. As reported for other cell types [16–18] exposure to high concentrations of ROS also evokes cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in rat glomerulosa cells. However, challenging these cells with smaller amounts of ROS (possibly closer to physiological ROS levels) attenuates IP<sub>3</sub>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and specifically reduces the efficacy of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transfer from the endoplasmic reticulum to mitochondria. Moreover, under such conditions intramitochondrial NAD(P)H is rapidly and reversibly oxidized, presumably not by P450 reactions [19]. Taking these observations into consideration it can be assumed that moderately increased ROS production might exert a negative feed-back on hormone production. Observations showing that decreased antioxidant defense of the aging adrenal is accompanied by reduced hormone producing ability [15] are also compatible with this assumption.

### 2. Control of aldosterone secretion by cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>

A characteristic feature of glomerulosa cells is their abundance in mitochondria, which make up 25–30% of cytoplasmic volume [20]. (Compare this for example with the reported value of about 5% in rabbit sensory neurons [21]!) Both the early stage (cholesterol to pregnenolone) and late stage of aldosterone biosynthesis occur in these organelles. An ACTH-induced cAMP signal, via the activation of protein kinase A (PKA), leads to the phosphorylation and, within 20–30 min, to the enhanced expression of Steroidogenic Acute Regulating (StAR) protein which ensures cholesterol supply to mitochondria [22–25]. StAR, by acting on the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) facilitates the movement of cholesterol from the OMM to the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) [26–28]. PKA also regulates the transfer of cholesterol from the OMM to the IMM by the translocator protein TSPO (previously known as peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor) and other accessory proteins (voltage dependent anion channel, Adenine Nucleotide Translocase and the PKA anchoring proteins ACDB1 and 3 (reviewed in [29,30]). In glomerulosa cells Ca<sup>2+</sup>, in addition to cAMP, activates and, after a lag-time of a few hours, induces the expression of StAR [31–33]. The effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the transcription of StAR is mediated by calmodulin and calmodulin-dependent

kinase I and/or IV [8,34]. The induction of aldosterone synthase by Ca<sup>2+</sup> requires hours or days [4].

### 3. Intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the reduction of pyridine nucleotides

The control of mitochondrial oxidative metabolism and consequently that of ATP formation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was indicated by the studies of Denton and co-workers [35] who found that pyruvate, isocitrate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenase activities in mitochondrial suspensions depend on [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the incubation medium. The validity of these observations for intact cells was confirmed in 1992, in K<sup>+</sup> stimulated rat adrenal glomerulosa cells [36] and in sensory neurons [37]. Glomerulosa cells respond with a mitochondrial NAD(P)H signal both to K<sup>+</sup>-evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and to stimulation by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilizing agonists angiotensin II and vasopressin [38,39]. When the electron transport chain is blocked with amytal or rotenone, the ensuing accumulation of reduced pyridine nucleotides cannot be increased by either K<sup>+</sup> or angiotensin II, confirming the mitochondrial origin of the NAD(P)H signal. The barely detectable delay in mitochondrial NAD(P)H peaks compared with cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> peaks and also the inhibition of mitochondrial NAD(P)H signal by chelation of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> [36] supported the assumption that cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal was transferred into the mitochondrial matrix.

### 4. Transfer of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal into the mitochondrial matrix

The transfer of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal from the cytosol into the mitochondrial matrix has been demonstrated with the use of the mitochondrially targeted Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive luminescent protein aequorine [40], shortly after Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mitochondrial NAD(P)H signals in glomerulosa cells [36] and neurons [37] were reported. The simultaneous formation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(P)H signals in the mitochondria was also observed in hepatocytes by Hajnóczky in 1995 [41]. Subsequent confocal microscopic studies demonstrated the coupling of cytosolic and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (evoked either with K<sup>+</sup> or angiotensin II) in glomerulosa cells [42]. It is worth recalling that very small physiological stimuli, 150 pM angiotensin II or raising [K<sup>+</sup>] from 3.6 to a mere 4.6 mM, were both quite effective in eliciting both mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(P)H signals [43].

In this respect it could be relevant that aralar 2 (citrine), an aspartate-glutamate transporter [44] is expressed in the glomerulosa cells (Szanda & Spät, unpublished). In principle this carrier may also mediate the effect of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> on the formation of mitochondrial NADH [45]. However, in permeabilized glomerulosa cells, in the absence of glutamate and aspartate) mild elevation of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>c</sub> (as small as 60–140 nM) is followed by elevated [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>m</sub> and mitochondrial NAD(P)H [46,47], refuting the idea that aralar 1 or 2 is required for the generation of NAD(P)H signal in this cell type.

### 5. Do mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(P)H exert any effect on steroid biosynthesis?

Ruthenium Red (RR) inhibits mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake via an action on the mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter [48] and on the voltage dependent anion channel (VDAC) [49]. Irrespective of the extramitochondrial effects of RR (reviewed in [49]) the drug may be expected to counteract the stimulation of hormone secretion, provided intramitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays an essential role in the control of steroid biosynthesis. In fact, it inhibits the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone by rat adrenocortical mitochondria [50] and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced aldosterone production in electropermeabilized
bovine glomerulosa cells [51]. Although the function of StAR is independent of intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ [26], it should also be considered that VDAC is attached to TSPO [29]. This way the binding of RR to VDAC may inhibit cholesterol transport into the mitochondrial matrix. Nevertheless, the effects of the drug are compatible with the presumption that Ca²⁺ has not only cytosolic but also intramitochondrial action(s) in stimulating hormone secretion. This conclusion was supported by the observation showing that inhibition of Ca²⁺ efflux from the mitochondria with CGP37157 potentiates Ca²⁺ (plus ionomycin)-induced pregnenolone production in bovine glomerulosa cells [52]. This leads us now to present evidence for the actions and significance of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling, with special attention to the function of glomerulosa cells.

Among the several physiological consequences of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ sequestration an essential one is NADH formation, giving rise to enhanced generation of ATP [53,54]. (Supraphysiological elevation of [Ca²⁺]m may also lead to the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore, followed by apoptosis [55], however, this is not the subject of the present review.) Increased production of ATP is obviously required for maintaining homeostasis of the cells, nevertheless, our observations indicate that the significance of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling is much more than this. Mitochondrial NADPH, required for 20α and 22-hydroxylations and subsequent scission of cholesterol as well as for 11β-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC) followed by 18-hydroxylation and 18-methyl oxidation of corticosterone leading to aldosterone, is formed mostly by NADP⁺ linked isocitrate dehydrogenase and transhydrogenation from NADH [56]. Therefore a specific role of the Ca²⁺-induced reduction of pyridine nucleotides in the biosynthesis of aldosterone has been postulated [36]. We have to admit that this view has not yet been generally accepted in the “aldosterone society”.

## 6. Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ - NAD(P)H - aldosterone

Classical biochemical studies on adrenocortical homogenates or mitochondrial suspensions showed the dependence of steroid formation on available NADPH. Rotenone, an inhibitor of NADH – coenzyme Q reductase, added in the presence of citric acid cycle intermediates enhanced side-chain cleavage of cholesterol. Moreover, the rate of side-chain cleavage was found to correlate

(A) Effect of stepwise raising of [K⁺] in the superfusion medium on [Ca²⁺]c and [Ca²⁺]m in a single rat glomerulosa cell. Two days after cell isolation the cells were preloaded with 0.5 μM Fura-PE3 (for monitoring [Ca²⁺]c, green circle) and 1 μM Rhod-2 (for monitoring [Ca²⁺]m, red x). Fluorescence measurements were performed with fluorescent wide-field microscopy at 31 °C, using an inverted microscope (Axio Observer D1, Zeiss) equipped with a 40× 1.4 oil immersion objective (Fluar, Zeiss) and a Cascade II camera (Photometrics). Excitation wavelengths were set by a random access monochromator connected to a xenon arc lamp (DeltaRAM, Photon Technology International). For excitation of Fura-PE3 340 and 380 nm and for that of Rhod-2 545 nm excitation wavelengths were applied, for the detection of emission 505 and 570 nm dichroic mirrors and 525/36 and 640/50 nm filters were used, respectively. Images were acquired every 5 s with the MetaFluor software (Molecular Devices) and MetaMorph software was used for data analysis. Fura PE3 fluorescence was converted into [Ca²⁺]c values as described [83]. Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake was normalized to fluorescence intensity measured at 3.6 mM [K⁺].

with the ratio of NADH to NAD⁺ in mitochondrial suspensions [10]. Krebs cycle intermediates support the reduction of pyridine nucleotides [10,57] and steroid hydroxylation [58–61], moreover, NADPH added together with fumarate or a glucose phosphate ester to adrenal homogenates stimulated corticosteroid production [62]. Although these observations are compatible with the significance of NADPH formation in steroid biosynthesis, an observation showing the lack of correlation between corticosterone secretion and NADPH concentration in homogenated total adrenal tissue (i.e. also containing the medulla) within 72 h following hypophysectomy [63] may have been regarded as an evidence against the role of NADPH formation in steroidogenesis. Finally, the pioneering publications have been neglected, in spite of strict biochemical deductions showing the role of NADPH formation [64]. Here we describe a series of experiments which, altogether, demonstrate the significance of the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ - NAD(P)H signaling in glomerulosa cells.

Potassium ions stimulate aldosterone secretion through activating voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels [1]. Aldosterone production by glomerulosa cells displays a biphasic response to K⁺, peaking at ~8 mM in rat [36,65,66] and 9–10 mM K⁺ in bovine glomerulosa cells [67,68]. As described above, Ca²⁺ mobilizing agonists induce the formation of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ and NAD(P)H signals

in rat glomerulosa cells [36,38,39,43]. Both increased reduction of NAD(P)⁺ and increased aldosterone production can be demonstrated in response to a physiological increase of [K⁺] and maximal levels can be observed at around 8.4 mM. Above 8.4 mM K⁺ both NAD(P)H level and aldosterone production fall. It should be noted that the fall in NAD(P)H takes place in spite of high [Ca²⁺]c and [Ca²⁺]m, reflecting the biphasic effect of Ca²⁺ on the activity of pyruvate and oxoglutarate dehydrogenases [69]. Considering that fluorescence intensity of NAD(P)H does not linearly correlate with its concentration, quantitative correlation of NAD(P)H fluorescence and [Ca²⁺]c or aldosterone production rate cannot be calculated, yet the conclusion can be drawn that aldosterone production by rat glomerulosa cells correlates better with mitochondrial NAD(P)H than with [Ca²⁺]c ([36] and Fig. 1).

These data raise the question whether there is detectable consumption of reduced pyridine nucleotides coincident with enhanced aldosterone synthesis. Using aminoglutethimide, an inhibitor of the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone, we can prevent the reoxidation of NADPH by steroid hydroxylases. In this situation, when mitochondrial NAD(P)H formation was induced by means of transient stimulation with K⁺, the decay of the NAD(P)H signal was significantly slower ([39] and Fig. 2). This observation suggests that NADPH is utilized for increased hormone

**Fig. 4.** Effect of increasing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake with knockdown of OPA1 on aldosterone production in H295R cells. For control the cells were transfected either with control RNA (not influencing mitochondrial morphology) or siRNA against Mfn1 (inducing mitochondrial fragmentation similarly to the effect of siRNA against OPA1). For [Ca²⁺] measurements the cells were also transfected with a plasmid encoding the mitochondria-targeted Ca²⁺ sensitive fluorescent protein inverse Pericam. (A and B) Two or three days after transfection (performed as described [79]) [Ca²⁺]m was measured with confocal microscopy. After cell permeabilization the mitochondria were depolarized and [Ca²⁺] of the cytosol-like medium was raised from 0 to 5 μM (indicated with horizontal line). Fluorescence intensity (F) of inverse Pericam indicating [Ca²⁺]m, was normalized for F in the control period (F₀) and F after the saturation of the dye with Ca²⁺ (Fmin) as follows: (1/F – 1/F₀)/(1/Fmin – 1/F₀). Data obtained from [79]. (C) For studying the effect of these gene silencings on aldosterone production transfection with the siRNA species were performed with electroporation.

production although after inhibiting steroid biosynthesis an effect of altered superoxide formation on the NAD(P)H level cannot be ruled out.

### 7. New observations on the role of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling

The following experiments in which various manoeuvres were applied to alter mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake or to change [Ca²⁺] in the mitochondrial matrix, provide unambiguous evidence that intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ plays an essential role in the enhancement of aldosterone secretion.

Ca²⁺ uptake by energized mitochondria occurs through the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uniporter (MCU) [70,71] which is localized in the IMM. Simultaneous activation of p38 MAPK and a novel protein kinase C attenuates the transfer of cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal into the mitochondria whereas inhibiting any of the two kinases accentuates it [72,73]. Apparently the kinases act on the OMM and thereby reduce the access of Ca²⁺ to the MCU [74,75]. It should be recalled that silencing p38 MAPKα amplifies the All-evoked mitochondrial Ca²⁺ response without significantly affecting the cytosolic response [73] (Fig. 3A and B). In view of these observations we assumed that if elevation of [Ca²⁺]m is required for an efficient aldosterone

response to angiotensin II then silencing of p38 MAPK expression, thus facilitating the Ca²⁺ supply to MCU, should enhance the secretory response. H295R cells were transfected with siRNA against p38 MAPKα or with a mixture of scrambled RNA. Although the expression of p38 MAPK was only partially inhibited, angiotensin II (1 nM)-induced 2 h aldosterone production was higher than in control RNA-transfected cells (p = 0.0002) [75] (Fig. 3C). (These results are not in contradiction with the observation showing that aldosterone production by H295R cells exposed to angiotensin II for 24 h was smaller in the presence of the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580 because the expression of aldosterone synthase was also significantly reduced [76].)

The fusion of mitochondria is regulated by the transmembrane GTPase proteins mitofusin (Mfn) 1 and 2 and OPA1 [77]. In addition to the fusion process, the dynamin-related GTPase protein OPA1 also regulates the diameter of the pore of IMM invaginations termed crista junctions [78]. To test the assumption that the diameter of the junctions influence [Ca²⁺] within the lumen of the cristae (and thereby the rate of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake) we examined the effect of OPA1 silencing on the mitochondrial signaling. For control the cells were transfected either with control RNA (not influencing mitochondrial morphology) or siRNA against Mfn1 (inducing mitochondrial fragmentation similarly to

**Fig. 5. Effect of binding of intramitochondrial Ca²⁺ on aldosterone production by H295R adrenocortical cells. In order to reduce ionized Ca²⁺ concentration within the mitochondrial matrix the cells were infected with the cDNA of the Ca²⁺ binding protein S100G, fused to a mitochondrial targeting sequence, applying an adenovirus vector under the control of the tetON promoter. Two days later the effect of 1 nM angiotensin II (indicated with the horizontal line) on [Ca²⁺]c and [Ca²⁺]m was measured with Fluo-4 (A) and Rhod-2 (B) by means of confocal microscopy. (C) Angiotensin II-induced mitochondrial NAD(P)H signal, monitored with fluorescent wide-field microscopy.

the effect of siRNA against OPA1). For [Ca²⁺] measurements the cells were also transfected with a plasmid encoding a mitochondria-targeted Ca²⁺ sensitive fluorescent protein (inverse Pericam or 4mt-D2). In H295R and HeLa cells silencing of Mfn1 had no effect but OPA1-knockdown was followed by increased mitochondrial Ca²⁺ uptake in agonist-stimulated intact cells [79] and in permeabilized cells superfused with various Ca²⁺ buffers [79] (Fig. 4A and B). Two-hour production of aldosterone was measured 3 days later. Gene silencing significantly increased both basal and angiotensin II (1 nM)-induced aldosterone production in OPA1-silenced cells as compared with cells transfected either with control RNA or siRNA against Mfn1 (p ≪ 0.001, Fig. 4C).

We also examined how the binding of ionized calcium in the mitochondrial matrix, without a simultaneous reduction of [Ca²⁺]c, influences aldosterone production. The mitochondrial targeting sequence of cytochrome c oxidase subunit 8 was fused in frame in front of the coding sequence of S100G, a calbindin-derived Ca²⁺ binding protein. This construct was cloned into an adenovirus vector under the control of the doxycycline-inducible tetON promoter to generate Ad-mitoS100G [80]. Two days after infection with Ad-mitoS100G and Ad-tetON angiotensin II-induced cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal was moderately enhanced (probably due to buffering Ca²⁺ increases in the proximity of InsP₃ receptors) but the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signal was significantly attenuated [80] (Fig. 5A and

B). In control experiments, ECFP targeted into the mitochondria, failed to affect either the cytosolic or the mitochondrial response to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II-evoked mitochondrial NAD(P)H signal was also significantly reduced [80] (Fig. 5C). S100G reduced both basal and angiotensin-induced aldosterone production [80] (Fig. 5D), showing the significance of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ in the control of hormone secretion.

Beside modifying the agonist-induced secretory response, knockdown of OPA1 increased basal aldosterone production rate whereas overexpression of mitochondria-targeted S100G reduced it. (There was also a tendency of increased basal aldosterone production after p38 MAPK-knockdown.) For explanation of this phenomenon it should be recalled that mitochondrial uptake of Ca²⁺, constitutively released from InsP₃ receptors, is required for efficient mitochondrial bioenergetics even under control conditions [81]. These results support the relevance of matrix Ca²⁺ in aldosterone biosynthesis. The observation that raising [K⁺] from 8.4 to 18 mM attenuated the mitochondrial NAD(P)H level and aldosterone response whereas [Ca²⁺]c and [Ca²⁺]m increased further, strongly suggest that mitochondrial NADPH potentiates the hypersecretion of aldosterone.

The close coupling of cytosolic Ca²⁺ – mitochondrial Ca²⁺ – NAD(P)H system with hormone secretion is not a unique feature of adrenal glomerulosa cells. In rat luteal cells prostaglandin F₂α brings about both mitochondrial Ca²⁺ and NAD(P)H response. After cell permeabilization elevation of [Ca²⁺]c from 60 to 140 nM induced not only mitochondrial Ca²⁺ but also NAD(P)H response [82]. It may be presumed that the NAD(P)H response transiently opposes the luteolytic action of PGF₂α. In addition, binding of mitochondrial Ca²⁺ with S100G in insulin producing INS-1 cells and primary rat β-cells revealed that [Ca²⁺]m controls signal-dependent NAD(P)H and ATP formation. It was also found that [Ca²⁺]m increases are necessary for sustained insulin secretion in glucose-stimulated INS-1 as well as primary β cells [80]. Thus, the mitochondrial Ca²⁺ - NAD(P)H response is not confined to steroid secreting cells but seems to be an important factor also in the control of peptide hormone secretion.

### 8. Conclusion

The bulk of evidence supports the concept that agonist-induced cytosolic Ca²⁺ signal, in addition to enhance the transfer of cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, also results in elevated mitochondrial Ca²⁺ and NAD(P)H concentrations (Fig. 6). In adrenal glomerulosa cells the level of NAD(P)H correlates with the rate of aldosterone production. Inhibition of the early stage of stimulated steroid biosynthesis retards the reoxidation of NAD(P)H. Enhancing mitochondrial Ca²⁺ signaling (without increasing [Ca²⁺]c) by various maneuvers enhances the reduction of pyridine nucleotides and the production of aldosterone. These concordant observations provide evidence in favor of the importance of mitochondrial [Ca²⁺]c in aldosterone biosynthesis and also support the assumed significance of enhanced NADPH formation in hypersecretion of aldosterone. The cytosolic Ca²⁺ -mitochondrial Ca²⁺ - NAD(P)H system is present also in ovarian luteal cells and plays a critical role in the sustained phase of glucose-induced insulin secretion.
