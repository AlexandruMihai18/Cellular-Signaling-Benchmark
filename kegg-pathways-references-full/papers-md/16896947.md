**Abstract** Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is, without doubt, the neurotransmitter for which the number of receptors is the highest. Fifteen genes encoding functional 5-HT receptors have been cloned in mammalian brain. 5-HT₃ receptors are ionotropic receptors, whereas all the others are metabotropic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). 5-HT receptor diversity is further increased by post-genomic modifications, such as alternative splicing (up to 10 splice variants for the 5-HT₄ receptor) or by mRNA editing in the case of 5-HT₂C receptors. The cellular and behavioral implications of 5-HT₂C receptor editing are of great physiological importance. Signaling of 5-HT receptors involves a great variety of pathways, but only some of these have been demonstrated in neurons. The classical view of neurotransmitter receptors localized within the synaptic cleft cannot be applied to 5-HT receptors, which are mostly (but not exclusively) localized at extra-synaptic locations either pre- or post-synaptically. 5-HT receptors are engaged in pre- or post-synaptic complexes composed of many GPCR-interacting proteins. The functions of these proteins are starting to be revealed. These proteins have been implicated in targeting, trafficking to or from the membrane, desensitization, and fine-tuning of signaling.

**Introduction**

Serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) is certainly one of the neurotransmitters that the general public knows the best but is also the most intriguing for researchers. The name “serotonin” retained in the literature indicates its presence in the serum (released from platelets; Rapport et al. 1948); however, 5-HT has also been called “enteramine” because of its early recognized presence, at high concentrations, in enterochromaffin cells (95% of 5-HT is found in platelets and the gastro-intestinal tract; Erspamer and Asero 1952). Serotonin is one of the oldest signaling substances to appear during evolution in coelenterates, arthropods, molluscs, tunicates, and vertebrates (Collier 1958). Unsurprisingly, therefore, serotonergic neurons are also among the earliest neurons to be generated during mammalian development, with 5-HT being released before conventional synapses are established (Gaspar et al. 2003). 5-HT is well known by the public, thanks to its roles in normal physiology including sleep, appetite, thermoregulation, and pain perception, and more importantly in human pathologies such as migraine, depression, fear and anxiety, obsessive compulsive disorders, schizophrenia, and addiction. A provocative role for serotonin systems in spiritual experi-
ences has also been proposed in a recent article, published in  
a respected journal, by Borg et al. (2003), although whether  
this can be taken seriously remains debatable.

5-HT, like a few other neurotransmitters such as  
acetylcholine, glutamate, and γ-aminobutyric acid  
(GABA), acts via two categories of receptors: ionotropic  
and metabotropic receptors. Ionotropic receptors (channel  
receptors) have a low affinity for their neurotransmitter  
ligand but a rapid activation constant (a few milliseconds).  
In contrast, metabotropic receptors (receptors acting  
through G protein activation and second messenger  
production) exhibit both a high affinity for their neuro-  
transmitter and a slow activation constant (in seconds or  
longer).

Fifteen genes encoding 5-HT receptors (5-HTR) have  
been cloned in the mammalian brain (Hoyer and Martin  
1997). Recently, three novel 5-HT₃-like genes (5-HT₃C, 5-  
HT₃D, and 5-HT₃E) have been identified (Niesler et al.  
2003), but to date, no functional analysis has been  
published. The 5-HT₃ receptors are ionotropic receptors  
(Van Hooft and Yakel 2003) and will not be discussed in  
this review. The others are G-protein-coupled receptors  
(GPCRs) with seven transmembrane domains. They can be  
categorized into four groups according to their main second  
messenger system: the 5-HT₁ receptors coupled to Gαi/Gαo  
proteins (5-HT₁A, 5-HT₁B, 5-HT₁D, 5-HT₁E, 5-HT₁F); the  
5-HT₂ receptors coupled to Gαq proteins (5-HT₂A, 5-HT₂B,  
5-HT₂C); the 5-HT₄, 5-HT₆, and 5-HT₇ receptors coupled to  
Gs proteins; and the 5-HT₅ receptors (5-HT₅A and 5-HT₅B)  
for which the coupling is still uncertain (Raymond et al.  
2001).

The diversity of metabotropic 5-HTR proteins is further  
increased by post-genomic modifications, such as alterna-  
tive splicing and mRNA editing. This will be the subject of  
the first part of this review. Their neuronal localization,  
including the synaptic localization when known, and their  
signaling pathways will be discussed in the second section.  
The third part deals with the nature and functions of a  
variety of GPCR-interacting proteins (GIPs; Bockaert et al.  
2003, 2004b) that form, together with 5-HTRs, “recepto-  
somes” implicated in their targeting and trafficking and in  
the fine tuning of their signaling properties. For lack of  
space, this review will often take illustrative examples  
rather than being exhaustive.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/). These genes di-  
verged from a common ancestor, and their structure reflects  
their evolutionary relationship (Barnes and Sharp 1999). 5-  
HT₁Rs are coded by intronless genes and clearly constitute  
a subgroup of genes that were derived from a duplicated  
ancestor (Fig. 1). 5-HT₂R genes are also closely related to  
two similar introns located at the end of transmembrane  
domain 2 (TM2) and within TM4-coding sequences. The 5-  
HT₂CR gene presents an additional intron in the extracel-  
lular domain of the coding sequences and extends over  
more than 183kb. Alternative splicing of the 5-HT₂R genes  
does not generate any functional splice variant (Xie et al.  
1996). The 5-HT₄R gene is far more complex. The coding  
sequence extends over more than 185 kb and includes at  
least 14 exons leading to multiple splicing combinations.  
To date, ten functional splice variants have been described  
that can be generated by alternative splicing of the human  
transcript (Bender et al. 2000; Hiroi et al. 2001). For nine of  
these variants, splicing gives rise to alternate C-terminal  
domains (Fig. 1). As some exons (such as the h or the  
i exons), in the 5-HT₄R gene, do not present any in-frame  
stop codons, many additional combinations probably  
remain to be discovered (Brattelid et al. 2004). The  
relevance and the functional role of such a multiplicity  
of isoforms also remain to be elucidated. The finding that  
the less-well represented 5-HT₄R splice variants (e.g., 5-  
HT₄(a)R and 5-HT₄(e)R) interact with specific intracellular  
proteins supports the view that these isoforms are in  
charge of the fine regulation of signal transduction and are  
not the result of transcriptional leakage (Joubert et al.  
2004). Two 5-HT₅R genes have been described in the  
rodent, but only the 5-HT₅AR can be generated in humans  
(Rees et al. 1994). A 5-HT₅BR pseudogene had been  
localized on chromosome 2 in Build 35.1 of the human  
genome. However, this annotation has been suppressed in  
the actual build (36.1). The 5-HT₆R gene presents a  
splicing site that lies in the middle of the intracellular loop  
3 and that is similar to the splicing site found in the 5-  
HT₅AR gene. Two separate exons encode TM6 and TM7  
of the 5-HT₆R. A non-functional splice variant has been  
described for this receptor (Olsen et al. 1999). The human  
5-HT₇R gene is more complex: different acceptor and  
donor sites can be used to generate three receptors that  
differ in the composition and length of their C-terminal  
domains (5-HT₇(a), 5-HT₇(b), and 5-HT₇(d)). Because of its  
altered intron-exon organization, the rat gene generates the  
5-HT₇(c) but not the 5-HT₇(d) isoform (Heidmann et al.  
1997). This splicing position giving rise to alternate C-  
terminus is similar to that found in the 5-HT₄R gene. The  
different C-terminal domains of the 5-HT₇R variants  
probably recruit specific sets of intracellular proteins that  
might modulate their function as demonstrated for the 5-  
HT₄R isoforms.

team of L. Descarries (Descarries et al. 1975). This does not mean that classical 5-HT synapses do not occur, but they are not largely present. Nerve endings often lack the junction membrane specialization that characterizes the synapse. The released 5-HT may diffuse in the extracellular space and reach relatively distant targets.

Moreover, the pleiotropic functions of serotonin are not only exerted by the concerted actions of multiple serotonin receptor subtypes but also by the multiple coupling of each receptor subtype. We will focus, in this review, on signaling in native brain tissues.

### 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs

The highest density of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs is found in the limbic areas (Lanfumey and Hamon 2004). 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors are localized in cell bodies and dendrites of 5-HT neurons of the dorsal and median raphe nuclei (Sotelo et al. 1990; Riad et al. 2000; Fig. 3a). They are chiefly expressed along extra-synaptic sites, as previously seen for many metabotropic GPCRs (Riad et al. 2000). At the post-synaptic level, such as the hippocampal formation, they are localized on dendrites of pyramidal and granule cells (Fig. 3a; Riad et al. 2000). 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase (AC) via pertussis-toxin-sensitive Gα<sub>i</sub> and/or Gα<sub>o</sub> proteins (De Vivo and Maayani 1986; Weiss et al. 1986; Fig. 4). However, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs do not seem to be coupled to AC inhibition in dorsal raphe nuclei, in spite of their high density within these nuclei.

Not only 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors, but also post-synaptic 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs inhibit neuronal firing. This inhibition is attributable to the activation of G-protein-gated inwardly rectifying potassium (GIRK) currents and the inhibition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Andrade et al. 1986; Oleskevich 1995; Sodickson and Bean 1998; Fig. 4). Activation of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors delays the action of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Indeed, SSRIs are efficient at the post-synaptic level only after desensitization of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors (Adell et al. 2005). For unknown reasons, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors desensitize much faster and to a much greater extent than post-synaptic receptors (Karschin et al. 1991). In serotonin transporter (SERT) knock-out mice, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub> auto-receptors are desensitized and down-regulated in the dorsal raphe nuclei, but not in the hippocampus (Fabre et al. 2000). Interestingly, 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs inhibit N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) function in prefrontal pyramidal neurons by decreasing the transport and expression of NR2B subunits into dendrites (Yuen et al. 2005). This effect may explain the inhibition of long-term potentiation (LTP) by 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs (Edagawa et al. 1998).

5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R activation stimulates neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus and the subventricular zone (Brezun and

### Figure 3 Examples of well-documented regional and cellular localizations (pink) of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs, 5-HT<sub>1B/1D</sub>Rs, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs, and 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs. They can be localized on cell bodies (either on 5-HT neurons or other neurotransmitter-containing neurons) or on axon terminals (of 5-HT

Daszuta 1999), an effect that seems to be required for antidepressant effects (Santarelli et al. 2003). They also reduce the length of dendrites and the number of spines (Yan et al. 1997). 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R agonists have been developed for anxiety. 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R invalidation consistently increases anxiety in mice (Gross and Hen 2004; Lanfumey and Hamon 2004).

Positive coupling of 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>Rs to AC, phospholipase C (PLC) and extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) pathways have only been seen in heterologous systems (Raymond et al. 2001) (Fig. 4).

### 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>Rs

5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>Rs are not expressed on cell bodies of 5-HT neurons but on terminals of 5-HT neurons and on terminals of other neurons, such as dopaminergic, GABAergic, and glutamatergic neurons, where they inhibit neurotransmitter release (Starke et al. 1989; Pauwels 1997; Sari et al. 1997; Riad et al. 2000). They are highly expressed in the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus (probably on striato-pallidal and striato-nigral GABAergic neurons). 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1D</sub>Rs are also present in the

Fig. 4 5-HTR signaling pathways and effectors (blue 5-HTR signal transduction in neurons, gray signaling linkages only in transfected cell lines, $PL$ phospholipase, $ERK$ extracellular signal-regulated kinase, $PK$ protein kinase, $IP3$ inositol triphosphate, $DAG$ diacylglycerol, $MAPK$ mitogen-activated protein kinase, $NOS$ nitric oxide synthase, $AHP$ after-hyperpolarization, $JAK$ Janus kinase, $STAT$ transcription pathway, $ih$ hyperpolarization-activated current, $Epa$ activated exchange factor)

These terminals form clusters, called barrels (Gaspar et al. 2003), in layer IV (Fig. 3b).

5-HT$_{1B}$Rs, like the other 5-HT$_{1}$Rs, are negatively coupled to AC via G$\alpha_{i}$/G$\alpha_{o}$ in native brain tissues, such
as the substantia nigra (Bouhelal et al. 1988; Fig. 4). In transfected cells, 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs regulate PLC, PLD, Akt kinase, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS), and ERK pathways, activate K<sup>+</sup> channels, and inhibit Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Raymond et al. 2001; Fig. 4).

Pharmacological and genetic studies suggest a role for 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs in the pathophysiology of obsessive-compulsive disorders, drug addiction, depression, and sleep. 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>R knock-out mice are aggressive (Gingrich and Hen 2001).

Both in vitro and in vivo experiments indicate that 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs control the development of axonal harbors and axon terminal clustering (Gaspar et al. 2003).

### 5-HT<sub>1E</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>1F</sub>Rs

These receptor subtypes are present in the brain, but little data concerning their neuronal localization are available. 5-HT<sub>1F</sub>R has been found on pre-synaptic trigeminal nerve terminals and mediates some of the effect of a new generation of triptans (rizatriptan, naratriptan, zolmitriptan; Lanfumey and Hamon 2004). Negative coupling to AC has been demonstrated in heterologous cells, but not neurons (Raymond et al. 2001; Fig. 4).

### 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs

5-HT innervation of the prefrontal cortex has received extensive attention from neuroanatomists, physiologists, and pharmacologists (Leysen 2004). 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs are particularly abundant in the pre-frontal cortex (Fig. 3c; Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998; Cornea-Hebert et al. 1999, 2002; Miner et al. 2003) and are certainly the site of action of hallucinogens, such as LSD (Aghajanian and Marek 1999b), and of some atypical anti-psychotics, such as clozapine and risperidone (Adell et al. 2005). Alterations in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R function may be a contributing factor to the cognitive impairment in mental disorders such as schizophrenia and depression (Kroeze and Roth 1998).

Light- and electron-microscopic immunohistochemistry has been used to determine the cellular and subcellular localization of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs in the pre-frontal cortex (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998; Cornea-Hebert et al. 1999, 2002; Miner et al. 2003; represented in Fig. 3c). A dense localization has been found in apical dendrite shafts, proximal to the pyramidal cell soma (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998). Some receptors are present in the soma of pyramidal cells and in the dendrites of local circuit neurons (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998). In one study (Miner et al. 2003), but not in another one (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998), a dense localization has been found on the spine heads and necks of pyramidal neurons. A marked intracellular density of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs, which may serve as a receptor reserve for trafficking to the plasma membrane, has also been described (Cornea-Hebert et al. 1999, 2002). A minority of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs is also found on axon terminals (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998; Miner et al. 2003). Whether 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs are localized on pre-synaptic glutamatergic terminals remains a matter of debate. In the primate cortex, a pre-synaptic localization on glutamatergic terminals has also been reported (Jakab and Goldman-Rakic 1998) although at low levels, whereas in the rat cortex, such a localization remains to be established (Miner et al. 2003). Some of these discrepancies may be related to the nature of the antibodies used. In the rat prefrontal cortex, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs have also been detected on terminals of aminergic fibers (Miner et al. 2003), which may explain the stimulation of this neurotransmitter release following 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation (Pehek et al. 2001).

In vitro electrophysiological studies indicate that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs enhance spontaneous excitatory post-synaptic currents (EPSCs; Aghajanian and Marek 1999a; Marek and Aghajanian 1999; Zhou and Hablitz 1999). Activation of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs also increases late EPSPs evoked by the electrical stimulation of afferent fibers (Adell et al. 2005). These effects are probably mediated by a release of glutamate and subsequent activation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) receptors, since they are inhibited by AMPA antagonists (Aghajanian and Marek 1999a) and by pre-synaptic group II metabotropic glutamate agonists, which are known to inhibit glutamate release (Marek et al. 2000). A pre-synaptic localization of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs on glutamatergic terminals may explain these results. However, if 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs are primarily localized on spine heads of pyramidal cells at asymmetric synapses receiving glutamate innervation, one has to speculate a post-synaptic influence on pre-synaptic glutamatergic release. This could be achieved via the post-synaptic production of a retrograde messenger. An increase in neuronal excitability may also be explained by a 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated inhibition of after-hyperpolarizations (I<sub>sAHP</sub>) in the prefrontal cortex (Villalobos et al. 2005).

However, the situation may be more complex because 5-HT inhibits (rather than stimulates) cortical pyramidal neuron activity in vivo (Zhou and Hablitz 1999). This could be the result of several synaptic effects. 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs induce a massive enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory post-synaptic currents (IPSCs) in pyramidal neurons via the activation of interneurons (Zhou and Hablitz 1999), an inhibition of the Na<sup>+</sup> current, which reduces dendritic excitability (Carr et al. 2002), an inhibition of the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (Day et al. 2002), and an inhibition of NMDA-receptor-mediated transmission (Arvanov et al. 1999). Indeed, depending on the kinetics of all these effects and on the kinetics of their desensitization, 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs may inhibit or excite pyramidal neuron activity. Normal cognitive functions may depend on a fine-tuning of theseopposing types of regulation (Williams et al. 2002). Interestingly, both the supra-normal level of 5-HT and the depletion of 5-HT result in altered spatial working memory and decision making, respectively (Williams et al. 2002).

Other electrophysiological studies suggest pre- and post-synaptic localizations of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A} / 2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs in the spinal cord. In superficial dorsal horn synapses, pre-synaptic \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A} / 2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs induce a long-lasting facilitation of miniature EPSC frequency (Hori et al. 1996). At the same synapses, post-synaptic \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A} / 2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs transforms silent glutamatergic synapses into active synapses, a mechanism that requires the interaction of AMPA receptors with PDZ-domain-containing proteins (post-synaptic density/disc large/zona occludens-1 proteins; Li and Zhuo 1998; Li et al. 1999).

With regard to second messenger production, \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}\) Rs activate PLC, PLA2, and the ERK pathway in neurons (Raymond et al. 2001). They also activate the Janus kinase (JAK)/transcription (STAT) pathway in skeletal and smooth muscle (Guillet-Deniau et al. 1997; Banes et al. 2005) and PLD in non-neuronal cells (Raymond et al. 2001; Fig. 4).

Unexpectedly, some antagonists (mianserin, spiperone, mesulergine) induce desensitization and internalization of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}\) Rs both in vivo and in vitro (Sanders-Bush 1990; Roth and Ciaranello 1991). This process may contribute to the redistribution of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}\) Rs from the membrane of apical dendrites to the cytoplasm of neuronal cell bodies following chronic treatment of rats with atypical antipsychotics (Willins et al. 1999).

### 5-HT<sub>2B</sub>Rs

In the adult brain, \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) Rs are found only in discrete nuclei of the cerebellum, the lateral septum, the dorsal hypothalamus, and the medial amygdala, contrasting with its wide expression in peripheral tissues, including the heart and lung. As \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}\) Rs, \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) Rs are coupled to Gα<sub>q</sub> proteins and activate PLC. However, to date, no study has reported such a coupling within neurons (Wainscott et al. 1993). \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) Rs have also been reported to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization in astrocytes derived from various rat cerebral regions (Sanden et al. 2000).

Additional \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) R-mediated signaling pathways have been described in non-neuronal cells expressing endogenous \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) Rs. Stimulation of the \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) R is associated with an increase in cyclic GMP through the dual activation of constitutive and inducible NOS. Gα<sub>q/11</sub>-coupled \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~B}}\) Rs also activate PI3K/Akt and ERK1/2 signaling pathways (Raymond et al. 2001) (Fig. 4).

### 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs

A comparison of the distribution of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) R mRNA with that of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) R protein labeled with <sup>3</sup>H-mesulergine in monkey and human brains has revealed both pre- and post-synaptic localizations of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) R (Lopez-Gimenez et al. 2001; Leysen 2004). These pre- and post-synaptic localizations of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs have been further confirmed by electron-microscopic studies performed in the mouse (Becamel et al. 2004; Fig. 3d). Data on the localization of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) are not consensual. Some suggest that \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs are primarily localized on non-dopaminergic neurons, probably GABAergic neurons (Di Matteo et al. 2001). These receptors may be constitutively active (Berg et al. 2005), yielding tonic GABAergic inhibition of dopaminergic neurons. Other data suggest that \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs are localized on dopaminergic neurons (Ji et al. 2006; Fig. 3d). Indeed, all studies agree that the activation of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs inhibits dopaminergic neurons (Gobert et al. 2000; Ji et al. 2006). Atypical anti-psychotics and particularly those with inverse agonism release this inhibition, providing a way to activate dopaminergic systems (Gobert et al. 2000; De Deurwaerdere et al. 2004; Berg et al. 2005). This activation may be relevant for the treatment of depression and the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. In kittens, \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs have a characteristic columnar expression in layer IV of the visual cortex during the critical period for ocular dominance plasticity. \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) agonists modulate synaptic plasticity during this period (Gaspar et al. 2003).

\(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs are also present in hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC)/cocaine amphetamine-regulated transcript (CART) neurons within the arcuate nucleus (Miller 2005). Activation of POMC/CART neurons inhibits feeding. This is certainly the main reason that \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\)-/- mice are obese (Miller 2005).

The highest density of \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs is found in epithelial cells of the choroid plexus, where these receptors control spinal fluid production (Leysen 2004).

\(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) R has been reported to activate PLC via Gα<sub>q/11</sub> in many brain regions, including the choroid plexus (Sanders-Bush and Breeding 1988; Chang et al. 2000; Fig. 4). These receptors also activate PLD in choroid plexus epithelial cells through a mechanism involving both Gα<sub>13</sub> and Gβγ subunits (McGrew et al. 2002). \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) R-mediated stimulation of PLA<sub>2</sub> and AC have been exclusively described in transfected cells (Raymond et al. 2001; Fig. 4). As observed for \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{~A}}\) Rs, \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) Rs are down-regulated following chronic antagonist exposure (Van Oekelen et al. 2003). However, the effects of such treatments are still controversial. Indeed, Schlag and coworkers (2004) have recently demonstrated that only \(5-\mathrm{HT}_{2 \mathrm{C}}\) R agonists and partial agonists promote receptor desensitization and internalization, whereas neither inverse agonists nor neutral antagonists have these effects (Schlag et al. 2004).
Further discussion of 5-HT₂C-R signaling, in particular with regard to editing, can be found below (Functions associated with editing).

### 5-HT₄Rs

5-HT₄Rs are mainly present in limbic structures (hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, amygdala), islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle, basal ganglia (striatum, globus pallidus), hippocampus, substantia nigra, and septum. Although the immunolocalization of 5-HT₄Rs is still not possible in brain synapses because of a lack of satisfactory antibodies, indirect evidence suggests that most of 5-HT₄Rs are localized post-synaptically. However, an heterologous pre-synaptic localization on terminals of cholinergic, GABAergic (dentate gyrus), dopaminergic, and serotonergic neurons is also likely because of the increase in the release of these neurotransmitters by 5-HT₄ agonists. Results from lesion studies and electrophysiological studies are also consistent with a pre-synaptic localization of 5-HT₄Rs (Bockaert et al. 1997, 2004a; Bockaert and Dumuis 1998).

Two studies have reported the immunolocalization of 5-HT₄Rs. One of them shows the localization of 5-HT₄Rs in respiratory neurons in the pre-Boetzinger complex (Manzke et al. 2003). Half of these neurons co-express μ-receptors and Substance-P-reactive neurokinin-1 (NK1) receptors. Reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction experiments have confirmed these findings (Manzke et al. 2003). In these neurons, 5-HT₄R activation overcomes fentanyl-induced respiratory depression (by reversing the inhibition of fentanyl-induced cAMP production) and re-establishes stable respiratory rhythms. The second study based on a different antibody has shown the immunostaining of myenteric and submucosal plexuses (Liu et al. 2005). Electron-microscopic analysis has indicated an axonal localization, especially in varicosities that contain large dense-cored and small synaptic vesicles. Electrophysiological data have revealed a pre-synaptic action of 5-HT₄Rs on cholinergic neurons leading to the increase in post-synaptic nicotinic EPSCs in mouse myenteric neurons (Bockaert et al. 2004a; Liu et al. 2005). They are also consistent with observations that 5-HT₄Rs stimulate acetylcholine release in the myenteric plexus (Kilbinger and Wolf 1992; Kilbinger et al. 1995).

5-HT₄Rs are positively coupled to AC in mice colliculi neurons and in guinea pig hippocampal membranes (Dumuis et al. 1988; Bockaert et al. 1990; Fig. 4). In colliculi neurons, the 5-HT₄Rs-mediated increase in cAMP concentration seen after a short application of agonist leads to the inhibition of voltage-gated K⁺ channels, including Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels, and their closure (Fagni et al. 1992; Ansanay et al. 1995). Moreover, the activation of 5-HT₄Rs produces a long-lasting inhibition of K⁺ channels because of the long-lasting blockade of phosphatase (Ansanay et al. 1995). In CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampus, 5-HT₄Rs reduce the AHP that follows action potentials. Moreover, 5-HT₄R activation induces a reduction in spike accommodation (Andrade and Chaput 1991; Torres et al. 1996). These effects are mediated by cAMP and protein kinase A (PKA) activation. 5-HT₁ARs, 5-HT₄Rs, and 5-HT₇Rs differentially expressed in CA1 neurons allow space-specific modulation of the hyperpolarization-activated current (Ih) current, which is known to adjust synaptic integration and the repetitive discharge behavior of CA1 neurons (Bickmeyer et al. 2002). In prefrontal cortex pyramidal neurons, 5-HT₄Rs can activate or inhibit GABAergic synaptic transmission. This regulation of the GABA<sub>A</sub> current is also mediated by cAMP- and PKA-dependent signaling pathways (Cai et al. 2002).

In hippocampal neurons, activation of the endogenous 5-HT₄Rs leads to a decrease in the length and number of neurites through the Gα₁₃/RhoA signaling pathway (Fig. 4; Ponimaskin et al. 2002).

Moreover, of note, 5-HT₄R activation, at least in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) cells, is associated with an increase in the tetrodotoxin-insensitive Na⁺ current, but the messenger involved in this effect does not appear to be cAMP (Cardenas et al. 1997). 5-HT₄Rs increase, via the production of cAMP, the activated exchange factor, Epac. Epac in turn activates the small G protein Rap1, which increases Ras GTP loading. This Epac-dependent signaling pathway stimulates sAPPα secretion (Lezoualc'h and Robert 2003).

In colliculi neurons, the desensitization of 5-HT₄Rs is homologous and results in the activation of G-protein-coupled receptor kinase type 2 (GRK2; Ansanay et al. 1992; Barthet et al. 2005). In heterologous cells, the GRK2 concentration is too low, and homologous desensitization of 5-HT₄Rs does not occur (Barthet et al. 2005).

Several reports clearly show the modulation of LTP and long-term depression (LTD) by 5-HT₄ agonists (Kemp and Manahan-Vaughan 2004, 2005). Interestingly, 5-HT₄Rs exert both a tonic and a phasic stimulatory control over dorsal 5-HT raphe neurons (Lucas and Debonnel 2002). This effect might be enhanced by the activation of 5-HT₄Rs expressed in the medial prefrontal cortex (Lucas et al. 2005). 5-HT₄Rs also positively modulate learning and memory, reward, sensitivity to novelty, and stress (Bockaert et al. 2004a; Compan et al. 2004).

### 5-HT₅Rs

Studies on the cellular and subcellular localization of 5-HT₅Rs by using immunohistochemical methods have led to contradictory results. Both astrocytes and neuronal local-

izations have been reported. One study reports a localization on 5-HT neurons, suggesting a possible role as autoreceptors. However, the quality of the antibodies used and the lack of specific pharmacological tools preclude any definitive conclusion regarding the functional role of these receptors (Nelson 2004).

Surprisingly, no study to date has identified a functional coupling of 5-HT<sub>5</sub>Rs in native neuronal tissue. Rat 5-HT<sub>5</sub>R transfected into C6 glioma cells has been shown to couple to the inhibition of cAMP production. In the same C6 glioma cells, one study has reported that the human 5-HT<sub>5A</sub>R couples to multiple signal transduction pathways, e.g., the inhibition of cAMP accumulation and of ADP-ribosyl cyclase and the activation of outward currents. This study has indicated that human 5-HT<sub>5A</sub>R is coupled to Gα<sub>i</sub>/Gα<sub>o</sub>; it also raises the possibility of a cross-coupling of the receptor to Gα<sub>q/11</sub> (Noda et al. 2003; Fig. 4).

### 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs

In the brain, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs are mainly found in the thalamus, hypothalamus (suprachiasmatic nucleus), cerebral cortex (both on pyramidal and GABAergic neurons), hippocampus (all CA regions), and amygdala (Hedlund and Sutcliffe 2004; Thomas and Hagan 2004). Most 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs are localized on both the soma and axon terminals (outside the synapses) of GABAergic neurons. Within the cerebellum, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs are exclusively located in Purkinje neurons. 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs are also found in intra- and extra-cranial blood vessels and meningeal tissues (Hedlund and Sutcliffe 2004).

In the guinea pig hippocampus, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs have been recognized as being the receptor with a high affinity for 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) coupled to AC (Bockaert et al. 1990, 1997). In heterologous cells, the four 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R splice variants activate cAMP production via the Gα<sub>s</sub> protein (Ruat et al. 1993). 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs also activate the ERK1/2 pathway in hippocampal neurons. However, the signaling pathway used by the receptor to activate ERK remains unclear. Most of the 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R-mediated activation of ERK has been found to be mediated via Gα<sub>s</sub>. Both PKA-dependent and -independent pathways might contribute to ERK activation. Until recently, the pathway for ERK activation was shown to require cAMP, PKA, and MAP kinase (MEK) in neurons endogenously expressing 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs and in 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R-transfected cells (including PC12 and HEK 293cells; Norum et al. 2003). However, another report indicates that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs activate ERK in hippocampal neurons and transfected PC12 cells through a pathway independent of PKA but requiring a cAMP-GEF, such as Epac (Lin et al. 2003).

5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs inhibit slow AHP in thalamic and trigeminal motor neurons (Goaillard and Vincent 2002). In vivo, SSRIs increase the population spike amplitude in CA1 and CA3 areas. This effect is blocked by SB-269970-A, a specific 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R antagonist (Matsumoto et al. 2002). In the CA1 region and in thalamic and rat DRG neurons, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs increases excitability through a mechanism involving a cAMP-mediated I<sub>h</sub> current (Bickmeyer et al. 2002). All these effects suggest an important role for 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs in the control of neuronal excitability and may contribute to greater information transfer within a neuronal network.

5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs endogenously expressed in hippocampal neurons significantly increase neurite length through the Gα<sub>12</sub>, RhoA, and Cdc42 GTPases-dependent signaling pathway (Kvachnina et al. 2005) (Fig. 4). Functional studies have also implicated 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs in thermoregulation and the activation of rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep via the modulation of suprachiasmatic nucleus neurons (Thomas and Hagan 2004). In this regard, 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R antagonists inhibit REM sleep and increase the latency to onset of REM sleep. This effect suggests that 5-HT<sub>7</sub>R antagonists are candidates

### 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs

5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs are almost exclusively expressed in the central nervous system. They are found at high concentrations in limbic and cortical regions (Woolley et al. 2004) but are not expressed in 5-HT neurons. Immunohistochemical studies including electron-microscopic investigations have shown prominent dendritic localization. Some non-motile cilia of the nucleus accumbens, the caudate-putamen, the olfactory tubercles, and the islands of Calleja cells also express 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs (Brailov et al. 2000). In the striatum, 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs are expressed by medium-sized spiny neurons projecting to the substantia nigra or globus pallidus (Gerard et al. 1997; Sebben et al. 1994). Preferential GABAergic localization is suggested in most brain localizations. No electrophysiological data are available. Selective antagonists have been synthesized and can now be used to investigate the physiological roles of 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs. For example, the selective antagonist SB-271046 has been shown to increase glutamate release probably via disinhibition of GABAergic inhibition (Woolley et al. 2004). Many studies have tried to correlate 5-HT<sub>6</sub>R polymorphisms with psychiatric disorders (Woolley et al. 2004). Contradictory results have been reported. Pharmacological studies and localization studies indicate possible roles in psychotic and affective disorders, anxiety, epilepsy, and memory retention but not the regulation of feeding (Woolley et al. 2004). Native 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs, like 5-HT<sub>4</sub>Rs and 5-HT<sub>7</sub>Rs, are positively coupled to AC via the Gαs protein in striatal tissue or primary cultures of striatal neurons (Schoeffter and Waeber 1994; Sebben et al. 1994). This positive coupling has been confirmed by 5-HT<sub>6</sub>Rs being expressed in various heterologous expression models (Ruat et al. 1993; Fig. 4).

for treating depression, a situation in which the REM sleep is disturbed. A role of 5-HT₇Rs in learning and memory is suggested by the observed decrease in synaptic plasticity in CA1 and contextual fear conditioning in 5-HT₇R-/mice (Thomas and Hagan 2004). 5-HT₇Rs are recognized for their important role in controlling hormonal release not only at the hypothalamic, but also at the peripheral level. A role in pain and migraine (via their action on blood vessels but also on neurogenic inflammation) is under investigation. Finally, a role in schizophrenia remains to be found in animal models (Hedlund and Sutcliffe 2004; Thomas and Hagan 2004).

### Fine-tuning of signaling functions

#### Constitutive activity

Studies performed mainly in heterologous cells transfected with both native and mutant forms of 5-HT₁Rs (Albert et al. 1999; Kiel et al. 2000), 5-HT₂Rs (Egan et al. 1998), 5-HT₄Rs (Claeysen et al. 1999), 5-HT₆Rs, and 5-HT₇Rs have demonstrated that 5-HTRs can exist in a conformation that mimics an active state of the receptor in the absence of agonist, thus revealing that these receptors display constitutive activity. All these studies highlight the importance of i2 and/or i3 loops in the regulation of constitutive activity of the majority of 5-HTRs and of the role of the C-terminus in the constitutive activity of 5-HT₄R and 5-HT₇R splice variants, which differ in the length of their C-terminal tail (for a review, see Bockaert et al. 2005).

However, to date, only 5-HT₂ARs and 5-HT₂CRs have been shown to exhibit constitutive activity in vivo (Berg et al. 2005). Harvey (2003) has shown that 5-HT₂AR inverse agonists, but not neutral antagonists, retard the learning of the conditioned eye link response in rabbits stimulated by LSD. This effect is not attributable to the blockade of endogenous 5-HT by inverse agonists, but rather to an inhibition of endogenous constitutive activity, because it occurs after lesions. Evidence of an in vivo constitutive activity of 5-HT₂CRs has come from experiments by De Deurwaerdere and co-workers (2004); by using microdialysis, they have demonstrated that SB 206553, an inverse agonist, but not the neutral antagonist SB 242084, enhances basal dopamine release in dopamine-innervated areas, such as the frontal cortex, the accumbens nucleus, and the striatum. The effects of the inverse agonist are insensitive to the lesion of 5-HT neurons and are blocked by the neutral antagonist.

#### Functions associated with editing

As seen above, 5-HT₂CR exhibits a unique mechanism of generating multiple functional receptor variants through a process called mRNA editing (Burns et al. 1997). RNA transcripts encoding the 5-HT₂CR undergo A to I RNA editing events at up to five sites (see above). In heterologous cells, RNA editing appears to regulate the pattern of intracellular signaling (Burns et al. 1997). The non-edited form (5-HT₂C-INIR) is more potent in stimulating PLC and exhibits more constitutive activity than the edited forms (Niswender et al. 1999). Moreover, non-edited 5-HT₂C-INIR is capable of coupling to the Gα₁₃ protein (activating the PLD signaling pathway and promoting Rho GTPase activity; McGrew et al. 2004), whereas the fully edited isoform 5-HT₂C-VGVIR fails to activate Gα₁₃ (Price et al. 2001).

RNA editing has an important implication for serotonergic signal transduction in vivo. Editing is regulated by 5-HT itself. Depletion of 5-HT increases the expression of edited forms having a high affinity for 5-HT, whereas stimulation of the 5-HT₂A/₂CRs has the opposite effect (Gurevich et al. 2002a). Moreover, altered RNA editing of the 5-HT₂CR may play a role in depression. 5-HT₂C mRNA isoforms expressed in human prefrontal cortex differ in tissues obtained from depressed suicide victims compared with healthy controls. In suicides, three abundant isoforms, resulting from an increase at the E and C sites and a decrease at the D site and encoding receptors, are expressed. These isoforms exhibit decreased basal activity and decreased agonist affinity and potency (Gurevich et al. 2002b). Recently, Kishore and Stamm (2006) have reported that the small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) HBII-52, which exhibits sequence complementarity to the alternative spliced exon V encoding for a functional 5-HT₂CR, regulates receptor mRNA splicing. Notably, Prader-Willy syndrome patients (characterized by neonatal muscular hypotonia, early childhood obesity, hypogonadism, and mental retardation) who do not express HBII-52 snoRNA exhibit abnormally low levels of the non-edited 5-HT₂CR isoform, suggesting a role of serotonergic systems in Prader-Willi syndrome (Kishore and Stamm 2006).

### 5-HTR interacting proteins and modulation of signaling

The first proteins found to have functional interactions with metabotropic 5-HTRs were, of course, G proteins (see above). Although coupling to G proteins remains a central event in 5-HTR-mediated signaling, an increasing body of evidence indicates that the regulation of their functional status also depends on interactions with a variety of additional protein partners. Like other GPCRs, 5-HTRs associate with β-arrestins in a manner that is dependent on receptor phosphorylation by GRKs. The binding of arrestins to the receptors promotes their internalization. This process requires the recruitment, by arrestins, of binding partners, including clathrin, the central component of the
endocytic machinery, AP2, another endocytic protein, and intracellular trafficking proteins such as NSF, ARF6, and ARNO (Lefkowitz and Shenoy 2005). β-Arrestins also serve as scaffolds for signaling enzymes such as c-Src, members of the MAP kinase pathways, and the c-Jun N-terminal kinase 3, which participate in 5-HTR signaling (Lefkowitz and Shenoy 2005). In addition to the binding to β-arrestins, which seems to be a general mechanism, 5-HTR subtypes can recruit specific protein partners. This section will describe our current knowledge concerning these subtype-specific interactions.

Metabotropic 5-HTRs are certainly the GPCRs for which the highest number of specific accessory proteins have been identified, thanks to methodologies such as the yeast two-hybrid screen and proteomic approaches combining affinity chromatography experiments and the identification of receptor partners by mass spectrometry. However, our present cognizance of 5-HTR protein partners fluctuates from one receptor to another. For some 5-HTRs (e.g., 5-HT₂AR, 5-HT₂CR, and several 5-HT₄R splice variants), interacting proteins have been extensively characterized by using, in part, proteomic approaches, whereas no binding partner has so far been identified for a number of 5-HTRs (Table 1). As for other GPCRs, most of the hitherto identified 5-HTR-interacting proteins associate with their C-terminus, even though some of them have been shown to bind to motifs located on intracellular loops (i2 and i3 loops).

### Proteins interacting with the 5-HTR C-terminal domain

#### PDZ-domain-containing proteins

The acronym PDZ derives from the three first proteins (PSD-95/Disc large/Zonula occludens-1) in which these domains have been described (Nourry et al. 2003). To date, PDZ proteins are certainly the most numerous proteins involved in the scaffolding of multiprotein complexes that contribute to the targeting, the trafficking, and the fine tuning of signaling properties of membrane-bound receptors, including GPCRs. Genome sequence analysis predicts the presence of more than 300 PDZ proteins in humans. PDZ proteins generally bind to a conserved consensus sequence (PDZ ligand) located at the extreme C-terminus of target receptors. PDZ domains have been classified according to their specificity for these C-terminal motifs. Class I PDZ domains preferentially bind to S/TXφ, class II to φXφ and class III to E/DXφ motifs, where φ represents a hydrophobic residue and X any residue (Nourry et al. 2003). Several 5-HTRs express class I or II canonical PDZ ligands, suggesting that they may interact with PDZ-based protein scaffolds. These include the three 5-HT₂R subtypes (SCV, SYV/I, and SSV, for 5-HT₂AR, the 5-HT₂BR, and 5-HT₂CR, respectively), several 5-HT₄R splice variants (SCF-
5-HT₄(a)R-, VPV-5-HT₄(e)R, and 5-HT₄(f)R-), and one 5-HT₇R variant (FVL, 5-HT₇(b)R).

The first evidence of an interaction between one 5-HTR and one PDZ protein was obtained by Ullmer et al. (1998). Screening a human brain cDNA library with the yeast two-hybrid system, this group isolated and cloned a multi-PDZ protein (the protein called MUPP1), which interacts with the C-terminal domain of the human 5-HT₂C receptor. MUPP1, which contains thirteen PDZ domains and no obvious catalytic domains, is the PDZ protein that contains the highest number of PDZ domains identified to date. The 5-HT₂CR specifically interacts with the 10th PDZ domain of MUPP1, leaving the other PDZ domains free to interact with additional partners within a larger complex (Becamel et al. 2001; Parker et al. 2003). This interaction is dynamically regulated by agonist-dependent receptor phosphorylation at Ser⁴⁵⁸, located in the PDZ-binding motif (position-2; Parker et al. 2003). The receptor/MUPP1 interaction induces both conformational changes in the MUPP1 protein (Parker et al. 2003) and receptor clustering at the cell surface (Becamel et al. 2001). MUPP1 also associates with the 5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₂BR, but the functional significance of these interactions remains to be demonstrated (Becamel et al. 2001).

A more comprehensive description of PDZ proteins that interact with 5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₂CR C-termini has been performed by using proteomic approaches comparing proteins “fished out” by using the receptor C-termini as bait and mutant baits in which the C-terminal valine residue, which is critical for interaction with target PDZ domains, has been mutated into an alanine (Becamel et al. 2002; Becamel et al. 2004). These studies have demonstrated that each 5-HT₂R subtype interacts with specific sets of PDZ proteins, even though they share an identical PDZ ligand (SXV), thereby underpinning the role of residues located outside this canonical sequence in the specificity for PDZ domains (Becamel et al. 2004). They have also revealed that 5-HT₂ARs only interact with PDZ proteins located at the post-synapse (e.g., PSD-95), whereas 5-HT₂CRs associate with PDZ proteins exhibiting both pre-synaptic and post-synaptic localizations (e.g., the Veli3/CASK/Mint1 complex), consistent with the differential distribution of the receptors at the synaptic junction. The association of 5-HT₂ARs with PSD-95 has been shown to enhance receptor-mediated signal transduction in heterologous cells, a process that can be related to the ability of PSD-95 to inhibit agonist-induced 5-HT₂AR internalization (Xia et al. 2003a). The functional consequences of the other interactions remain to be demonstrated. However, several studies with receptors mutated at the PDZ ligand indicate that 5-HT₂R/PDZ protein interactions play a critical role in governing receptor targeting in neurons and/or modulating their signal transduction properties.

*Refers to experiments in which the receptor PDZ binding motif has been deleted.*

ligand seems to be essential for preferential receptor targeting to the dendritic compartment of pyramidal cortical neurons (Xia et al. 2003b). The deletion of the 5-HT₂CR PDZ ligand, which prevents agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation (see above), modulates the desensitization/resensitization of the receptor Ca²⁺ effector pathway in NIH-3T3 fibroblasts (Backstrom et al. 2000). A similar approach has indicated the 5-HT₂BR PDZ ligand is essential for receptor-mediated activation of constitutive and inducible NOS activities in a murine cell line (Manivet et al. 2000). The interaction of 5-HT₂Rs (probably 5-HT₂ARs) with PDZ proteins may also be involved in the

persistent facilitation of sensory synaptic transmission in the spinal cord dorsal horn, a process underlying chronic pain, following tissue injury (Li and Zhuo 1998). This facilitation results from the mobilization of AMPA receptors into the synapses, transforming silent synapses into functional ones (Li and Zhuo 1998). The recruitment of synaptic AMPA receptors induced by 5-HT₂ agonists requires PDZ proteins that physically interact with GluR2/3 AMPA receptor subunits (Li et al. 1999). Thus, 5-HT₂ and AMPA receptors appear to be functionally linked by a PDZ-based protein scaffold, contributing to the facilitation of nociceptive transmission in the spinal cord. The molecular composition of this PDZ scaffold is still unknown.

Specific sets of PDZ proteins interacting with 5-HT₄(a)R and 5-HT₄(e)R have also been characterized by proteomic screens (Joubert et al. 2004). Among the 5-HT₄(a)R PDZ-binding partners, NHERF-1 (also designated as Ezrin-radixin-moesin-binding phosphoprotein 50, EBP50) and SNX27, a recently cloned sorting nexin, have attracted particular attention. Interaction of the 5-HT₄(a)R with NHERF-1 targets the receptor to specialized subcellular microdomains and seems to be involved in receptor-mediated cytoskeleton remodeling and the modulation of cell shape (Joubert et al. 2004). SNX27 belongs to a large protein family involved in the targeting of cell surface receptors to the endocytic compartment. The 5-HT₄(a)R/SNX27 interaction has been consistently found to target part of the receptor pool to early endosomes in heterologous cells (Joubert et al. 2004). Two forms of SNX27 that differ in their C-termini (designated as SNX27a and b) have been identified. Both proteins interact with the 5-HT₄(a)R C-terminus and are enriched in the brain. SNX27b, but not SNX27a, has been found to be up-regulated in the neocortex of rats following acute exposure to psychostimulants, such as amphetamines and cocaine (Kajii et al. 2003). This up-regulation, blocked by D1 receptor antagonists, is reminiscent of stimulant-induced behavioral sensitization and therefore may be involved in the initiation and/or maintenance of long-term neuronal adaptation in response to psychostimulant compounds. As 5-HT₄Rs have been involved in drug sensitization and addiction (Compan et al. 2004), the 5-HT₄R/SNX27 interaction may contribute to neuronal adaptation mechanisms underlying these processes.

Other proteins interacting with 5-HTR C-termini

Several 5-HTR subtypes have been shown to interact physically with calmodulin (CaM) via their C-terminus (5-HT₂AR and 5-HT₂CR; Becamel et al. 2002; Turner and Raymond 2005) and/or their intracellular loops (5-HT₁AR and 5-HT₂AR; Turner et al. 2004; Turner and Raymond 2005). Putative CaM-binding sites have also been identified by using a CaM-binding site search engine ([http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/pub_pages/search/index.htm](http://calcium.uhnres.utoronto.ca/ctdb/pub_pages/search/index.htm)) for the intracellular loops of 5-HT₁B, 5-HT₁D, 5-HT₁E, 5-HT₁F, 5-HT₂C, 5-HT₆, and 5-HT₇ receptors and in the C-terminus of 5-HT₄ and 5-HT₇ receptors (Turner and Raymond 2005), but these interactions remain to be established. The 5-HT₂AR C-terminal CaM-binding site, located at the juxtamembrane region, overlaps with a putative PKC phosphorylation site. CaM binding and receptor phosphorylation by PKC in vitro have been found to be antagonistic. This suggests that the interaction of CaM with the 5-HT₂AR C-terminus can modulate receptor phosphorylation and desensitization (Turner and Raymond 2005).

The 5-HT₂AR C-terminus also interacts with ARF1 and, to a lesser extent, ARF6 (Robertson et al. 2003). ARF proteins bind to a conserved NPxxY motif that has been found in a number of rhodopsin family GPCRs and that is located at the junction of the transmembrane domain 7 and the C-terminal domain (Johnson et al. 2006). This motif is critical in determining selective interaction with isoforms of ARF (Johnson et al. 2006). The interaction between 5-HT₂AR and ARF proteins appears to be essential for 5-HT₂AR-mediated PLD activation, which is independent of Gαq/11 (Robertson et al. 2003). A weaker interaction between ARF1-6 and the i3 loop of the receptor has also been demonstrated. In addition to PDZ proteins and CaM, the 5-HT₂CR C-terminal domain recruits two other proteins with unknown functions: PTD4, a putative GTP-binding protein, and PICOT, a novel PKC theta-interacting protein with a thioredoxin homology domain that is involved in the regulation of the thioredoxin system (Becamel et al. 2002). The 5-HT₄(a)R associates with CRMP2, a member of the collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) family, essential components of the molecular machinery leading to growth cone collapse in response to semaphorins. CRMP2 induces the outgrowth of multiple axons with a collapse of all dendrites in hippocampal neurons in vitro, thereby promoting neuronal polarity (Inagaki et al. 2001). 5-HT₄(a)Rs have been shown to cause Gα₁₃- and RhoA-dependent neurite retraction and cell rounding in neuroblastoma glioma NIE-115 cells (Ponimaskin et al. 2002). Whether the physical interaction between 5-HT₄(a)R and CRMP2 contributes to the receptor regulation of neuronal architecture remains to be elucidated. Sec23A, a component of the COPII complex involved in the transport of secretory and plasma membrane proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, has been found to associate with the 5-HT₄(e)R C-terminus (Joubert et al. 2004). This interaction is inhibited by the deletion of the four C-terminal residues of the receptor, indicating a critical role of the extreme C-terminal sequence in the trafficking of short 5-HT₄R variants from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane.

Proteins interacting with the intracellular loops of 5-HTRs

As previously mentioned, CaM-binding sites have been identified in the intracellular loops of several 5-HTR subtypes. CaM has been shown to interact with two distinct motifs located in the N- and C-terminal juxtamembrane regions of the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R i3 loop (Turner et al. 2004). Binding of CaM to 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R has been found to be antagonistic with PKC-mediated receptor phosphorylation, suggesting a role in receptor desensitization. This interaction may also be critical for the 5-HT<sub>1A</sub>R-mediated activation of the ERK signaling pathway, a process involving agonist-induced receptor internalization (Della Rocca et al. 1999). Interaction of CaM with the i2 loop of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs decreases receptor-mediated <sup>35</sup>S]GTPγs binding to NIH-3T3 cell membranes, suggesting an inhibitory role of CaM in 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R-mediated signal transduction by dampening the interaction with the G protein (Turner and Raymond 2005).

5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs interact (via their intracellular loops) with other proteins that influence receptor subcellular distribution within neurons or modulate their signal transduction properties. These include the cytoskeletal microtubule-associated protein MAP1A, caveolin-1, and the p90 ribosomal S6 kinase 2 (RSK2). The association of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs (i3 loop) with MAP1A may be responsible for the intracellular distribution of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs (in an inactive state) in the dendritic compartment of pyramidal neurons of the cerebral cortex (Cornea-Hebert et al. 2002). The 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R/caveolin-1 interaction, which has been observed in both C6 glioma cells and rat brain synaptic membrane preparations, appears to be essential for targeting the receptor to lipid rafts. This interaction facilitates 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R coupling to Gα<sub>q</sub> proteins (Bhatnagar et al. 2004) and appears to be essential for the serotonin-induced inhibition of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels (Kv1.5), which form a ternary complex with 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs and caveolin-1 upon 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation in smooth muscle cells of the pulmonary artery (Cogolludo et al. 2006). In contrast, the association of 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>Rs (i3 loop) with RSK2 seems to be required for the tonic inhibition of receptor signaling exerted by this kinase (Sheffler et al. 2006). This tonic inhibition may result from constitutive receptor phosphorylation leading to a constitutively desensitized state. RSK2 expresses a C-terminal class I PDZ ligand (TAL), and RSK2/PDZ protein interactions have been demonstrated to be important for RSK2-mediated modulation of excitatory synaptic transmission. This offers the possibility that 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R, RSK2, and PDZ proteins form a unique signaling complex modulating 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R function. In fetal myoblasts, serotonin induces a physical association of the 5-HT<sub>2A</sub> receptor with Jak2, providing a way of recruiting STAT3 by the receptor-kinase complex and the subsequent phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT3 (Guillet-Deniau et al. 1997). The binding site of Jak2/STAT3 on the receptor (intracellular loops versus the C-terminus) is still uncertain. Activation of members the JAK/STAT pathway upon 5-HT<sub>2A</sub>R activation has also been reported in vascular smooth muscle (Banes et al. 2005), but whether their physical association with the receptor is required for this activation remains to be demonstrated.

A recent study has revealed that 5-HTRs are not only capable of interacting with protein kinases, but that they can also associate with phosphatases, modulating their phosphorylation state. This study has demonstrated a physical interaction between the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R i3 loop and the tumor suppressor PTEN, an enzyme exhibiting both lipid and protein phosphatase activities (Ji et al. 2006). This interaction takes place in dopaminergic neurons of the VTA innervating the accumbens nucleus, these are tonically inhibited by active 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs. PTEN coupling with 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>Rs prevents agonist-induced receptor phosphorylation at C-terminal serine residues. Disruption of the 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R/PTEN interaction with a membrane-permeant peptidyl mimetic of the PTEN-binding site consistently reproduces the inhibitory effect of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub> agonists on VTA dopamine neuron firing. Such a peptide also prevents the rewarding effects of cannabinoids, effects that are mediated by the increased activity of VTA dopamine neurons, without the apparent side-effects observed following agonist activation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R. These experiments indicate that the regulation of 5-HT<sub>2C</sub>R functional activity mediated by the interaction with PTEN plays an important role in the reinforcing role of drugs (Ji et al. 2006). Another recent study has reported the interaction of the third intracellular loop of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>Rs with p11 (also called S100A10 or calpastatin light chain or annexin II light chain), a member of the S100 EF-hand protein family (Svenningsson et al. 2006). This interaction enhances 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>R signaling efficacy by promoting its expression at the cell surface. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the dysfunction of 5-HT<sub>1B</sub>R regulation by p11 might be involved in depressive states: (1) p11 brain expression is increased by antidepressant treatments, whereas the level of the protein is reduced in an animal model of depression and in the brain of depressed patients; (2) p11 overexpression reproduces some behavior triggered by antidepressants in mice, and (3) p11 knock-out mice exhibit a depression-like syndrome and reduced responsiveness to antidepressant treatments (Svenningsson et al. 2006). These last-mentioned examples highlight the essential role of 5-HTR/accessory protein interactions in physiology and pathology and the potential of therapeutic strategies aimed at developing drugs capable of disrupting or reinforcing these interactions and exhibiting fewer side-effects than classical agonist- or antagonist-based treatments.

Concluding remarks

Metabotropic 5-HTRs are directly or indirectly the site of action of the most important drugs used to treat widely expressed psychiatric diseases such as depression, schizophrenia, and obsessive-compulsive behaviors. They are also the direct or indirect site of action of several important drugs of abuse such as cocaine and LSD. Finally, they play an essential role in cognition. Therefore, we need increase our knowledge of the 5-HTRs themselves, their signal transduction properties in neuronal cells, their role in synaptic plasticity, and the functional consequences of their interaction with accessory proteins. We have seen in this review that many questions remain to be addressed. With respect to 5-HTR-associated proteins, recent studies have clearly established their important functional and perhaps physiological roles (Bockaert et al. 2004b; Ji et al. 2006; Svenningsson et al. 2006). We are confident that pharmacological agents and perhaps drug targeting will clarify these interactions.
