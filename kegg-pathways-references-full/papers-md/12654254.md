Fig. 2. Mechanisms behind the anti-apoptotic activity of NF-κB. NF-κB inhibits TNFα-induced apoptosis through induction of a variety of anti-ap
deficient in NF-κB activation, but completely defective in TNF-α stimulated JNK activity [54]. The exact mechanism behind the increased sensitivity to TNF-α has yet to be determined.

The role of JNK activation in TNF-α induced apoptosis has been a highly controversial issue. Based on the results of transient transfection experiments using JNK activators or dominant negative forms of c-Jun,
IKKβ is essential for NF-κB activation by TNF-α, while IKKα is dispensable [7]. During TNF-α or FasL induced apoptosis, IKKβ, but not IKKα or IKKγ, is cleaved by caspase 3-related caspases [68]. Cleavage of IKKβ results in elimination of its enzymatic activity [
as well as promoting cell proliferation makes it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Indeed, inhibition of NF-κB triggered apoptosis in certain leukaemias and lymphomas, suggesting that its activity is essential for growth and/or survival of these cancer cells [81–83]. In addition, inhibition of NF-κB resulted in increased sensitivity of tumor cells to cancer therapy-induced apoptosis, especially in response to chemother
