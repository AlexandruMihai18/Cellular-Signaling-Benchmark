### Abstract

Plant responses to pathogenic invaders result from recognition of nonself elicitors. Host surveillance proteins activate distinct signaling pathways that induce partially overlapping defensive responses. Pathogen virulence is promoted by inhibition of these pathways. This evolutionary struggle has produced plant immune systems that rely on a continuum of layered defenses.

### 1. Introduction

Plants rely on an innate immune system to defend themselves. This immune system is based on recognition of nonself. The ability of an organism to detect a potentially pathogenic invader is a critical step to activation of an effective response. Immune recognition of nonself determinants occurs directly, via receptor ligand interaction, and indirectly, via host-encoded intermediates. Unlike animals, however, plants cannot couple recognition to somatic recombination of their DNA. Thus, to meet the ever-changing pathogen landscape, plants have relied on a lateral expansion of their innate immune system. This has led to a complex and layered defense system characterized by a large number of highly mutable host defense proteins.

The character of a plant’s defensive response is controlled by its genetics. Resistance to a pathogen can be achieved at both the species and cultivar level. Cultivar level resistance occurs when specific members of a plant species, but not the species as a whole, have acquired resistance to a particular pathogen. Cultivar resistance is often associated with localized cell death, otherwise known as the hypersensitive response (HR). This dramatic response is generally induced by gene-for-gene recognition of a pathogenic determinant by a host encoded Resistance (R) protein. R-proteins are expressed variably within a species, thus allowing distinct members of one plant species to differ in their resistance to a particular pathogen.

In contrast to cultivar level resistance, nonhost resistance occurs when an entire plant species is resistant to a particular pathogen. Nonhost resistance can result from successful passive defenses, such as a preformed barrier or toxic chemical. Nonhost resistance can also result from active defenses induced upon pathogen recognition. The defenses induced in nonhost resistance sometimes include an HR, but frequently result from basal defensive responses, which are defined in this review as those defensive responses that occur in the absence of an HR.

Basal defenses are critical to the ability of plants to fend off would-be pathogens. These defenses have been traditionally viewed as weak and generally ineffective. This perception has resulted, at least in part, because basal defensive responses are often observed during compatible interactions; i.e. interactions in which the pathogen proliferates and disease results. Basal defenses during compatible interactions can be weakened or delayed because pathogens deploy numerous

molecules such as effector proteins and toxins that inhibit basal defenses. Basal defenses activated during incompatible interactions, for example with nonhost range pathogens, are often sufficient to stop pathogen growth and prevent disease.

This review highlights an emergent theme in plant immunology. Specifically, disease resistance results from a continuum of layered defense mechanisms. Ultimately, there may be few clear boundaries between nonhost resistance and cultivar level resistance. For example, recognition of bacterial effectors by host R-proteins contributes to both nonhost and cultivar level resistance. Recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) also contributes to both types of resistance, although PAMPs likely make a more significant contribution to nonhost resistance (Fig. 1). Similarly, there is significant overlap between basal defenses and defenses induced during an HR. Neither the types of pathogenic molecules that elicit resistance nor the molecules used by the host to recognize pathogens are strictly correlated with the class of resistance or the type of defensive response. Rather,

the final defense phenotype likely depends on which/how many defense pathways are triggered and how strongly those pathways are activated.

2. Mechanisms of cultivar level and nonhost resistance overlap

Preformed physical and biochemical barriers constitute a plant’s first line of defense against pathogens [1,2]. These passive defenses include the presence of preformed surface wax and cell walls, antimicrobial enzymes, and secondary metabolites. Although these barriers can prevent invasion, pathogens have evolved strategies to overcome them. Motile foliar bacteria enter the leaf apoplast through wounds or stomata. The penetration pegs of fungal appressoria generate considerable force sufficient to puncture plant barriers. When passive defenses are breached, plants rely on their innate immune system to prevent disease with active responses.

Activation of defenses requires recognition of a pathogen. Upon sensing a pathogen, plants organize a sophisticated set

of inducible defensive responses. In the following sections we will describe: (1) the types of molecules that elicit defensive responses, (2) the surveillance molecules used by the host to detect them, and (3) the types of responses induced upon recognition. It is apparent that the distinct types of elicitors and receptors induce different but semi-redundant defensive responses.

### 2.1. Pathogen molecules that elicit defensive responses

Numerous molecules of diverse nature trigger defensive responses in plants [3]. Throughout this work we focus on the interactions between plants and Gram-negative phytopathogenic bacteria with some references to fungi and oomycetes as well. Plants recognize foreign molecules including PAMPs and bacterial effector proteins. In plants, PAMPs are sometimes known as general elicitors and often constitute indispensable structural components of the pathogen. On the other hand, effector proteins are virulence proteins that are delivered from the bacteria and can be delivered into the host cells by the type III secretion system (TTSS). Fungi and oomycetes also secrete effectors into the apoplast and, at least for oomycetes, into the host’s cytosol [4].

#### 2.1.1. PAMPs

A variety of surface-exposed and cytoplasmic bacterial molecules contain PAMPs [5]. Flagellin is a protein subunit that builds the bacterial flagellum. A 22 amino acid peptide (flg22) from within flagellin constitutes a PAMP perceived in *Arabidopsis* [6]. Other surface PAMPs include lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) and lipooligosaccharides, which are abundant components of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria [7–10]. Two examples of cytosolic proteins that contain PAMPs are elongation factor Tu (EF-Tu) [11] and cold shock proteins (CSPs) [12]. Small domains within each of these indispensable microbe-specific proteins are recognized in plants. Active or passive bacterial export systems and/or release caused by the host during the process of infection make these molecules available for recognition by plants. All of these PAMPs induce defense responses in plants. The contribution of PAMP-induced defenses to effective overall resistance will be discussed later.

#### 2.1.2. Bacterially secreted effector proteins

Infections with Gram-negative bacteria expose plants to a wide variety of effector proteins. The most widely studied class is the type III effector proteins secreted by the bacterial TTSS into the host cells [13]. The intended function of these effector proteins is to promote bacterial virulence. However, if recognized by the host, they can instead induce defense responses. A single bacterium can secrete anywhere from 20 to nearly 100 type III effectors into cells of the host [14,15]. Furthermore, the collection of type III effectors is highly variable, even between closely related strains of bacteria. The diversity of type III effectors has been recently reviewed elsewhere [16]. Recognition of type III effectors can underlie both cultivar level and nonhost resistance. *Xanthomonas campestris* pv.

vesicatoria (Xcv) is the causal agent of leaf spot disease on pepper and tomato. Cultivar-level resistance of tomato to Xcv can result from the recognition of AvrRxv, a type III effector [17]. AvrRxv also causes an HR on bean plants that are a nonhost species for Xcv. Finally, expression of AvrRxv in heterologous bacteria can induce resistance in normally susceptible hosts [18].

### 2.2. Host molecules that recognize pathogens

The host molecules that recognize PAMPs and type III effectors contribute to both nonhost and cultivar-level resistance. These receptors are frequently categorized as PAMP-receptors and R-proteins. However, the basis for this distinction is not always clear. Therefore, we have instead categorized them on the basis of their localization and domain structure.

Plants encode a variety of extracellular and intracellular R-proteins (Fig. 2). For the purpose of this review, we define R-proteins as all the host molecules that recognize pathogen elicitors, thus PAMP-receptors are a subset of R-proteins. At least three classes of R-proteins have been characterized: (1) cytoplasmic proteins with a nucleotide binding site (NB) and leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), (2) proteins with extracellular LRRs and an intracellular kinase domain (receptor-like kinases, RLK), and (3) membrane-spanning proteins with extracellular LRRs (RLP). *Arabidopsis* contains approximately 230, 110, and 150 genes that encode RLK, RLP, and NB-LRR proteins, respectively [19,20]. It is not clear how many of these ~500 genes play a role in plant disease resistance.

#### 2.2.1. Membrane-spanning R-proteins

Plant RLKs recognize both PAMPs and effector proteins. An example of an RLK that recognizes a PAMP is FLAGELLIN-SENSING 2 (FLS2) from *Arabidopsis*, which recognizes flg22 [21]. Mutation of *FLS2* can cause enhanced susceptibility to bacterial infection [22]. A mutation that disrupts TLR5, a human RLP that recognizes flagellin, is associated with susceptibility to *Legionella pneumophila* [23]. An example of an RLK that recognizes an effector is *Xa21* from rice, that confers cultivar-specific resistance to *X. oryzae* pv. *oryzae* (Xoo) carrying *AvrXa21* [24]. *AvrXa21* is an effector secreted from Xoo via a type I secretion system [25]. It is interesting that plants induce defense responses to type I secreted effectors in addition to the many known examples for type III secreted effectors.

A second class of plant R-proteins, namely RLPs, also recognizes both PAMPs and effector proteins. The tomato receptor for ethylene-inducing xylanase recognizes a PAMP from within the 22-kDa fungal protein [26,27]. The tomato *Cf*-genes, which recognize fungal effectors, encode membrane spanning glycoproteins with extracellular LRRs and a small cytoplasmic domain [28]. For example, *Cf-2* confers resistance to the leaf mold, *Cladosporium fulvum*, if it expresses a secreted protease inhibitor, *Avr2*. *Cf-2* function is negatively regulated by the tomato extracellular protease *Rcr3*. *Avr2*

### 2.2.2. Cytosolic R-proteins

Plant-encoded, cytosolic R-proteins recognize pathogenic molecules both directly and indirectly. The major class of cytosolic R-proteins is NB-LRR proteins [20]. In addition to their central NB domain and carboxy-terminal LRRs, the amino-terminus of these proteins also contains either a Toll and IL-1 receptor domain (TIR; intracellular domain of animal receptors) or coiled-coil domain (CC). RPM1, RPS2, and RPS5 are CC-NB-LRR proteins from *Arabidopsis* that recognize the *Pseudomonas* type III effectors AvrRpm1, AvrRpt2, and AvrPphB, respectively. Each of these bacterial type III effectors is perceived indirectly by the respective R-proteins. Other cytosolic R-proteins recognize bacterial effectors directly. RRS1-R is a TIR-NBS-LRR protein in *Arabidopsis* that recognizes the type III effector PopP2 from *Ralstonia solanacearum*, a vascular pathogen that causes bacterial wilt in a variety of different plant species [30]. RRS1-R is a unique R-protein because it has an extended carboxy-terminus that includes an NLS and a WRKY domain, characteristic of a large family of plant transcription factors. RRS1-R associates directly with PopP2 and this interaction localizes RRS1-R to the nucleus where it may directly activate defense transcription [31]. Pto from tomato is a ser/thr protein kinase that directly interacts with and recognizes AvrPto, a *Pseudomonas* type III effector protein [32]. Function of Pto requires Prf, an NB-LRR protein, and Prf recognizes AvrPto indirectly [33]. Currently, type III effectors are the only known elicitors,

from bacterial pathogens, that are recognized by plant NB-LRR proteins.

Similarities exist between the innate immune receptors of plants and animals. Both kingdoms use membrane-spanning proteins with extracellular LRRs and cytosolic NB-LRR proteins to detect pathogen-derived elicitors. Plant NBS-LRR proteins share domain architecture with animal proteins, such as the cytosolic receptors NOD1 and NOD2, which recognize PAMPs [34]. These similarities, as well as limited similarities in the signaling pathways activated in plants and animals, led to speculation that the innate immune systems of plants and animals evolved from a common, ancient evolutionary surveillance system [5]. However, the lack of similarity in the overall immune signaling components have called this idea into question [35].

### 2.3. Characteristics of defensive responses

Plant defensive responses overlap considerably, regardless of whether the invader is restricted by cultivar level resistance, nonhost resistance, or is virulent. Resistant interactions induce either an HR or effective basal defenses, while compatible interactions only culminate in ineffective basal defenses. The early physiological and biochemical events and the signaling requirements are similar for each type of interaction. Differences exist in the timing and strength of the responses.

Encounter with a pathogen induces rapid biochemical changes. An early and transient increase in cytosolic Ca²⁺ is indispensable for activation of defense signaling. Even though Ca²⁺ influx is observed during both compatible and

incompatible interactions, more sustained cytosolic Ca²⁺ levels are required for the oxidative burst and HR [36]. The oxidative burst, production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is another early defense response. Resistance is characterized by sustained production of ROS that requires the prior accumulation of Ca²⁺ [37]. Accumulation of ROS in plant cells is implicated in mediating cell wall cross-linking, the induction of defense gene expression, and the induction of the HR [38].

Nitric oxide (NO) is an important signaling molecule in plant defense. NO functions in combination with ROS to potentiate the hypersensitive cell death against *P. syringae* in both soybean cells and *Arabidopsis* leaves [39]. Virus-induced gene silencing of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), a key enzyme for the maintenance of basal resistance in tomato plants against *P. syringae*, led to enhanced susceptibility in both resistant and susceptible tomato cultivars [40]. Moreover, S-nitrosylation of cysteine thiols in proteins is believed to regulate NO signals. For example, S-nitrosylation of the antioxidant tripeptide glutathione forms S-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), which is thought to function as a mobile reservoir of NO bioactivity. Interestingly, loss of the GSNO reductase compromises basal defenses and the HR involved in cultivar level and nonhost resistance in *Arabidopsis* plants [41].

Plant defenses include the production of plant hormones, such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene [42]. SA is a key regulatory molecule that contributes to both cultivar level and nonhost resistance. SID2 from *Arabidopsis* is an isochorismate synthase required for defense-associated biosynthesis of SA [43]. Mutant *sid2* plants permit enhanced growth of pathogens normally restricted by basal defenses, but still maintain cultivar-level resistance associated with an HR. SID2 and SA have mixed roles in nonhost resistance. *Arabidopsis* is a nonhost for the causal agent of rust in cowpea, *Uromyces vignae*. Wild-type plants restrict colonization by *U. vignae*, but *sid2* plants support pathogen growth [44]. On the contrary, nonhost resistance against *P. syringae* pv. *phaseolicola* (Psp) still occurs in *sid2* [45].

The function of SA in *Arabidopsis* depends, at least in part, on NPR1 [46]. SA alters the disulfide bonding state of NPR1, reducing it to oligomeric form [47]. NPR1 then moves to the nucleus where it interacts with TGA transcription factors and activates gene expression [48]. Activation of NPR1 induces the transcription of pathogenesis related (PR) genes and components of the protein secretory pathway [49]. Both SA and NPR1 play key roles in local resistance and in the induction of systemic acquired resistance (SAR) [46]. SAR results in plant-wide, broad-spectrum resistance. Overlap likely exists in the mechanism by which SA and NPR1 contribute to local and systemic defensive responses.

The function of NB-LRR type R-proteins is required for both nonhost and cultivar level resistance. SGT1 is a highly conserved ubiquitin ligase associated protein that is part of the SCF ubiquitin ligase complex [50, 51]. Silencing of SGT1 in *Nicotiana benthamiana* disrupts the resistance mediated by NBS-LRR type R-proteins involved in cultivar level resistance [52]. Silencing of SGT1 also disrupts nonhost

resistance against the bacterial pathogens *P. syringae* pv. *maculicola* and *X. axonopodis* pv. *vesicatoria*. On the contrary, SGT1 is not required for nonhost resistance against *X. campestris* pv. *campestris* and cauliflower mosaic virus, indicating that nonhost resistance can result from both SGT1-dependent and SGT1-independent signaling.

Plants have many proteins that are differentially required for function of distinct R-proteins. Examples include RAR1 and HSP90, which allow NB-LRR proteins to accumulate in a functionally ready, but inactive state [53]. RAR1 is required for function of a subset TIR-NB-LRR R-proteins that induce cultivar level resistance against a variety of isolates of *Hyaloperonospora parasitica* [54]. Silencing of HSP90 in *N. benthamiana* disrupted nonhost resistance against *P. cichorii* [55]. Many mutations that cause enhanced disease susceptibility, in addition to *rar1* and *hsp90*, are required for the function of distinct subsets of R-proteins. The variability in signaling requirements for individual R-proteins indicates that these R-proteins signal via a complex network.

The type of elicitor does not define the strength of responses. As a general trend, PAMPs induce basal defenses and effectors induce an HR, but both types of elicitors can induce both types of responses. For instance, flagellin induces basal defense in *Arabidopsis*, but its over-expression can induce a strong nonhost-HR response in tomato plants [56]. Further, this HR in tomato requires flagellin expression. A PAMP from the oomycete pathogen *Phytophthora* termed necrosis-inducing *Phytophthora* protein 1 (NPP1), also induces hypersensitive cell death-like lesions in parsley and *Arabidopsis* [57]. Many type III effectors have been shown to induce an HR, but type III effectors also can induce basal defensive responses without an associated HR [58].

The type of receptor does not determine the strength of response. This is well exemplified by defense responses associated with the membrane-spanning R-proteins - FLS2, Xa21 and the Cf-proteins. Upon elicitor recognition, FLS2 from *Arabidopsis* and Xa21 from rice induce basal defenses, while the Cf-proteins trigger an HR. Even for similar receptors that induce an HR the strength of response can vary. The CC-NBS-LRR R-proteins RPM1, RPS2, and RPS5 activated by Pst expressing the appropriate Avr-proteins induce, respectively, a strong HR that is apparent within 5 h, a strong HR that is apparent in 15 h, or a weak HR that is barely discernable from pathogen-induced necrosis at 24 h.

If neither the elicitor, nor the type of receptor determines the strength of response, then, it is reasonable to ask, what does determine the strength of responses? The strength of responses is likely controlled in three ways. First, the signaling flux varies for individual interactions. For example, RPM1, RPS2, and RPS5 may encounter different amounts of elicitor, the elicitor may appear with different kinetics, or even if the elicitors are equivalent, these R-proteins may differ in the strength of signal they generate. Second, fundamental differences may exist between the signals generated by different R-proteins. Evidence that these differences do exist comes from the variability in signaling requirements for individual R-proteins. Third, the overall amount of response generated

can be affected by the combination of signaling activated in
the host. Cultured parsley cells inoculated with low concentrations of two different elicitors, namely LPS and harpin, induced minimal defensive responses. However, when the molecules are added in combination, an additive effect is observed [5].

## 3. Determinants of successful resistance

Factors that determine the effectiveness of the host's defenses include, which defense signaling pathway(s) are activated, how many pathways are activated, whether the pathogen inhibits those pathways, and ultimately what is the cumulative defensive response that is induced.

### 3.1. Which defense signaling pathways are activated?

PAMP-based defenses are important for disease resistance in plants. This statement has not always been accepted because of the observation that PAMP-bearing pathogens are often virulent. However, pathogens deliver a cocktail of effectors, one function of which is to inhibit PAMP-based defenses. Thus, it is not surprising that pathogens able to inhibit PAMP-signaling do not have their virulence curtailed by PAMP-based defenses. An alternative way to consider the efficacy of PAMP-based defenses is to ask, “How frequently is the virulence of nonpathogenic bacteria restricted by PAMP-based defenses?” Thus, plant interactions with nonhost pathogens may provide plentiful cases in which resistance results from PAMP-signaling. PAMP-signaling can also contribute quantitatively to resistance against virulent bacteria. *Pst* grows better on *fls2* than wild-type plants when the bacteria are spray-inoculated [22]. Apparently, during bacterial migration through stomata, FLS2 induces partially effective defensive responses.

Effector-induced defenses contribute to cultivar level and nonhost resistance in plants. This statement is widely established for the contribution of many type III effectors in cultivar level resistance, where the induced defensive signaling often causes an HR. Effector-induced, cultivar level resistance can also result from basal defensive responses, as is observed for Xa21-dependent resistance of rice to *Xoo* [24]. Nonhost resistance against bacteria, fungi, and oomycetes can also result from either an HR or basal defensive responses [3]. Mysore and Ryu divided nonhost resistance into two types. Type I does not result in an HR, or any other visible symptoms (e.g., necrosis), at the site of infection. Type II nonhost resistance is associated with HR at the site of infection. The HR observed in type II nonhost resistance frequently requires type III secretion, indicating that effectors are a source of resistance in these interactions. Work described in the next section indicates that type I nonhost resistance also requires defenses induced by type III effectors. Therefore, bacterial effectors elicit defense signaling that induces basal defenses or an HR and contributes to cultivar level and nonhost resistance. Pathogens that do not induce a strong defensive response still induce a partially effective host defense. Many plant mutations permit normally compatible pathogens to grow even

better [59]. Therefore, even during a compatible interaction, basal defenses of the host are partially restricting growth of the pathogen. Many of these enhanced disease susceptibility mutations also disrupt the function of select R-proteins involved in nonhost and cultivar level resistance. Thus, the partially effective defense responses observed in compatible interactions may result from activation of one or more R-proteins. It is clear that overlapping signaling controls the induction of partially effective basal defenses, effective basal defenses, and defenses associated with an HR.

#### 3.2. How many defense signaling pathways are activated?

The complexity of induced defenses may contribute to the durability of nonhost resistance. The PAMPs and effectors from pathogenic bacteria elicit multiple defense pathways. However, defense activation does cause resistance when a pathogen inhibits those defense pathways that it activates. Cultivar level resistance results when a pathogen fails to inhibit only a single defense pathway. As a result, cultivar level resistance is often fragile and frequently overcome in natural populations. On the contrary, nonhost pathogens can induce multiple, un-inhibited defense pathways, and thus elicit resistance that is more durable. Since nonhost resistance restricts the vast majority of would-be pathogens, it is likely that a continuum of layered defenses, induced by multiple elicitors, accounts for the majority of disease resistance in nature.

An explicit example of how layered defenses restrict the growth of a nonhost pathogen has come from studies with *Psp* (J. Ham, M. Kim, and D. Mackey, unpublished data). *Arabidopsis* exhibits type I nonhost resistance to *Psp*. A series of observations indicate that basal defenses prevent growth of the bacteria. First, PAMPs and multiple type III effectors from *Psp* induce at least three distinct defense pathways in *Arabidopsis*. Second, inhibition of one or even two of these defense pathways can be insufficient to permit growth of *Psp*. Third, when all three defense pathways are simultaneously inhibited, *Psp* grows and causes disease in a manner comparable to the virulent pathogen *Pst*. Thus, it is apparent that nonhost resistance of *Arabidopsis* against *Psp* results from activation of multiple, independently effective defense pathways.

#### 3.3. Are the activated defense signaling pathways inhibited by the pathogen?

Pathogens inhibit defense signaling in the host. By doing so, a pathogen can alter significantly which and how many defense signaling pathways ultimately induce defensive responses (Fig. 1). For example, bacteria deploy numerous type III effector proteins that inhibit various defense signaling pathways. One function of such effectors is to inhibit the HR, either by non-specifically inhibiting programmed cell death or by inhibiting a specific signaling pathway that leads to an HR [60–63].

Type III effectors also inhibit multiple basal defense signaling pathways in the host [64]. For example, PAMPs from type

III secretion deficient Pst induce cell wall associated defense responses. Wild-type Pst does not induce these responses because the type III effector AvrPto inhibits the PAMP-induced signaling pathway [65]. One or more other type III effectors from Pst induce SA-dependent defense responses that are inhibited by yet other type III effectors, AvrE or HopM1 [58]. The fact that pathogens can inhibit multiple defense signaling pathways is also illustrated by studies of the interaction of Psp with *Arabidopsis* (J. Ham, M. Kim, and D. Mackey, unpublished data). Co-infiltration of Pst, along with Psp, inhibits all three Psp-induced defense pathways and enhances the growth of Psp. Inhibition of Psp-induced defenses by Pst requires a functional type III secretion system and is therefore mediated, at least in part, by type III effector proteins.

Defense suppression also depends on pathogenic molecules other than type III effectors. To fully suppress Psp-induced defenses, Pst requires its ability produce the phytotoxin, coronatine (J. Ham, M. Kim, and D. Mackey, unpublished data). A coronatine deficient strain of Pst [66] enhances the growth of Psp less than does wild-type Pst. Coronatine is a JA-mimic, which can inhibit SA-signaling by stimulating antagonistic JA-signaling [42]. Thus, pathogenic bacteria rely on phytotoxins, such as coronatine, and type III effectors to inhibit host defense signaling.

### 3.4. What is the overall defensive response?

Similarities exist in the plant defensive responses produced during interactions with various types pathogens. Some of these similarities were discussed above in Section 2.3. Different pathogens induce and inhibit distinct defense signaling pathways. The net defensive response results from the signaling pathway(s) activated by a pathogen that are not subsequently inhibited by the pathogen. The occurrence or lack of an HR constitutes a dramatic difference between overall responses. However, striking similarities still exist between basal defensive responses and defensive responses that will ultimately lead to an HR. Similarities also exist between cultivar level and nonhost resistance and the induction of SAR.

Semi-overlapping defensive responses are revealed clearly by transcriptional profiling experiments. Tao et al. [67] performed large-scale mRNA expression profiling using Affymetrix GeneChips. *Arabidopsis* responses to *Pseudomonas* bacteria were compared for three types of interactions: (1) the compatible interaction with the highly virulent DC3000 strain of Pst, (2) resistant interactions with Pst DC3000 carrying either of two plasmids encoding type III effectors that induce cultivar level resistance and an HR, and (3) the nonhost resistant interaction with Psp that induces effective basal defenses but no HR. Resistant interactions associated with an HR and with effective basal defenses had similar profiles. The profile in these resistant interactions was also similar with the compatible interaction, although the resistant interactions induced more rapid and robust responses. The importance of timing and magnitude of the transcriptional responses highlights the importance of bacterial molecules that inhibit or delay defense signaling in the host.

Transcriptional profile analysis also shows overlap between an HR and a non-HR response induced by single elicitors. The profiling experiments described in the previous paragraph are complicated by the complexity of the elicitors, i.e. whole bacteria. These bacteria simultaneously induce and inhibit a variety of defensive responses. Navarro et al. made similar comparisons between the transcriptional responses induced by flg22, a purified PAMP, and Avr9, a defense eliciting protein from *C. fulvum* [68]. Avr9 induces a Cf-9 dependent HR in tomato and flg22 induces FLS2-dependent basal defenses in *Arabidopsis*. At least one *Arabidopsis* ortholog was induced by flg22 for 13 of 21 Avr9/Cf-9 rapid elicited (ACRE) genes from tomato. In addition, overlap also was observed between flg22-induced profile and the profile induced during the resistant interaction with Psp. Twelve and 34% of the genes induced 3 hours and 6 hours post inoculation with *Psp* bacterial treatment, respectively, overlapped with flagellin-induced genes from both *Arabidopsis* elicited cell culture and seedlings.

The various types of local defenses also display similarities with the transcriptional profile of SAR. Maleck et al. [69] analyzed the transcriptional changes in *Arabidopsis* during different SAR-inducing conditions and found that SAR-associated gene expression changes overlapped with those observed during a compatible interaction. Yet, SAR stops the growth of those compatible pathogens. Thus, the timing of basal defenses relative to infection is likely key to the outcome of infection. It is reasonable to assume that co-regulation of genes during various types of local defense responses and during SAR represents overlapping control mechanisms, such as function of NPR1.

## 4. Conclusions

Layered defensive responses can be placed into an evolutionary model (Fig. 1). The starting point is a nonhost pathogen that is restricted by the plant’s defensive responses. Through evolution, two types of changes convert a nonhost pathogen into a virulent pathogen: (1) the pathogen discards elicitors or alters them in a way that they are no longer recognized by the plant and (2) the pathogen acquires virulence factors, such as type III effector proteins and toxins, that permit it to overcome defenses of the host. The fact that Pst inhibits numerous host defense pathways indicates that the second mechanism is at least partially responsible for the emergence of a pathogen. Interaction between the pathogen and its new host species then drives plant and pathogen co-evolution at the cultivar level. This model fits well with recent data supporting indirect recognition of effector proteins.

A model for indirect recognition of effectors was described by the “guard” hypothesis. While examples of direct interaction between effectors and R-proteins exist, for example the rice Pi-ta CC-NBS-LRR protein and the avirulence protein Avr-Pita from the blast fungus pathogen *Magnaporthe grisea* [70], and the RRS1-R protein and PopP2 [31], many R-proteins appear to interact indirectly with the effectors they detect. These indirect interactions support the “guard”

hypothesis, which posits that type III effectors have targets in the plant cell and these targets are manipulated as part of the virulence activity of the effectors. R-proteins recognize perturbations of these virulence targets, which they are said to “guard”, and thus indirectly recognize the effectors. Molecular evidence for the “guard” hypothesis has been obtained for numerous cognate pairs of R-/effector proteins, including RPM1/AvrRpm1 [71], RPS2/AvrRpt2 [63, 72], RPS5/AvrPphB [73], and CF-2/Avr2 [29].

RPM1 and RPS2 both “guard” the *Arabidopsis* protein RIN4 (Fig. 3A). AvrRpm1 interacts with and induces phosphorylation of RIN4 [71]. It is hypothesized that this perturbation is the signal that activates RPM1. AvrRpt2, a cysteine protease effector from *P. syringae*, induces degradation of RIN4 [63, 72]. The disappearance of RIN4, induced by AvrRpt2, activates RPS2. RPM1 and RPS2 induce very potent defensive responses that include an HR. These results led to several questions, “What is the function of RIN4 in the absence of RPM1 and RPS2?” and “Is targeting of RIN4 by AvrRpm1 and AvrRpt2 involved in the virulence activity of these effectors?”

RIN4, AvrRpm1, and AvrRpt2 each regulate PAMP-induced defense signaling (Fig. 3B) [74]. RIN4 is a negative regulator of PAMP-signaling. Lack of or over-expression of RIN4 respectively enhances or represses the efficiency of PAMP-induced defense signaling. One function of type III effectors is to inhibit PAMP-induced defense signaling. Thus, the role of RIN4 in regulating PAMP-signaling may account for why it is targeted by multiple effectors. Indeed, both AvrRpm1 and AvrRpt2 inhibit PAMP-signaling to a much greater extent than does RIN4 alone. AvrRpm1 may do so by activating RIN4. To explain how AvrRpt2, which destroys a negative regulator of PAMP-signaling, inhibits PAMP-signaling, it is necessary to hypothesize that AvrRpt2 destroys proteins additional to RIN4. Specifically, AvrRpt2 must degrade proteins that are positively involved in PAMP-signaling. The proteolytic cleavage site targeted by AvrRpt2 is highly conserved in 19 *Arabidopsis* proteins other than RIN4, a few of which are degraded by AvrRpt2 [75]. Several of these proteins share sequence homology with RIN4. We predict that one or more of these RIN4 related proteins contributes positively to PAMP-signaling.

Basal defenses protect the plant in two ways. First, they directly restrict the growth of many would-be pathogens. To overcome basal defenses, pathogens rely on molecules that inhibit defensive signaling in the host. Second, basal defenses indirectly protect the plant. If the host expresses the appropriate R-protein, it recognizes those molecules intended to inhibit basal defenses, and in such a host those molecules actually induce defenses. The studies of RIN4 illustrate each of these points (Fig. 3). PAMP-induced defense signaling induces basal defenses in *Arabidopsis* that are important for restricting the growth of nonhost bacteria. In becoming pathogenic, bacteria overcame PAMP-induced defenses by acquiring effectors, such as AvrRpm1. While it can promote virulence, deploying AvrRpm1 also constitutes a risk for the bacteria; plants expressing RPM1 are resistant. Thus, cultivar level resistance is layered over, and functionally tied to, basal defenses that contribute to nonhost resistance. It is fascinating to consider further that, in plants lacking RPS2, AvrRpt2 inhibits cultivar level resistance induced by RPM1. This activity of AvrRpt2 results from degradation of RIN4, which is required for function of RPM1 [63]. These molecules tell of a “never ending” co-evolution between hosts and pathogens.

Fig. 3. RPM1 and RPS2 “guard” *Arabidopsis* RIN4 against effectors that inhibit PAMP-induced defense signaling.

Considering resistance as a continuum of layered defensive responses will permit testing of models in which these layers work collectively and/or independently to restrict the growth of nonhost pathogens. The recognition events leading to defensive signaling will vary for different nonhost pathogens. It will be interesting to determine the degree of overlap in which and how many signal transduction pathways are activated and how these defense pathways contribute to an effective overall resistance response.
