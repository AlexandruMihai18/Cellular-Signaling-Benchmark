**The NAD metabolome — a key determinant of cancer cell biology**

**Alberto Chiarugi**${}^{1}$, **Christian Dölle**${}^{2}$, **Roberta Felici**${}^{1}$ and **Mathias Ziegler**${}^{2}$

**Abstract** | NAD is a vital molecule in all organisms. It is a key component of both energy and signal transduction — processes that undergo crucial changes in cancer cells. NAD${}^{+}$-dependent signalling pathways are many and varied, and they regulate fundamental events such as transcription, DNA repair, cell cycle progression, apoptosis and metabolism. Many of these processes have been linked to cancer development. Given that NAD${}^{+}$-dependent signalling reactions involve the degradation of the molecule, permanent nucleotide resynthesis through different biosynthetic pathways is crucial for incessant cancer cell proliferation. This necessity supports the targeting of NAD metabolism as a new therapeutic concept for cancer treatment.

Malignant transformation requires specific adaptations of cellular metabolism to support growth and survival. These cancer-specific alterations are a prototypical hallmark of tumour development and represent a major consequence of genetic mutations and the ensuing changes of signalling pathways in cancer cells ${}^{1-3}$. The Warburg effect (FIG. 1) can perhaps be regarded as the first discovery that related tumour biology to metabolism. Tumour cells exhibit increased lactate production owing to a highly increased rate of glycolysis for biomass production (known as aerobic glycolysis), in addition to oxidative phosphorylation. That is, instead of eventually transferring electrons from NADH to the mitochondrial respiratory chain, a large proportion of cytosolic NAD${}^{+}$ is regenerated by reducing pyruvate to lactate (FIG. 1). NAD${}^{+}$ is vital not only for energy transduction, but also as a key component of signalling pathways. Thus, this pyridine nucleotide has emerged as one of the most important links between regulatory and bioenergetic processes. NAD${}^{+}$ is required for monoADP ribosylation and polyADP ribosylation, NAD-dependent protein deacetylation and the generation of Ca${}^{2+}$-mobilizing molecules such as cyclic ADP ribose and nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) ${}^{4,5}$. NAD-mediated signalling events participate in the regulation of crucial biological processes, including transcription, cell cycle progression, DNA repair, circadian rhythms and metabolic regulation. Clearly, the control of such important events has implications in different pathological states, including neoplastic transformation and cancer progression.

Unlike the metabolic redox reactions, which reversibly oxidize or reduce pyridine nucleotides, NAD${}^{+}$-dependent signalling processes continuously consume NAD${}^{+}$. In fact, regeneration and maintenance of the cellular NAD content have now been recognized as crucial homeostatic processes with immediate effects on NAD${}^{+}$-dependent signalling and energy transduction. However, the incessant regeneration of NAD pools is a major challenge, especially for fast-dividing tissues. This realization has prompted molecular studies of NAD metabolism and its exploitation for the development of anticancer agents. Recent advances have revealed a surprising versatility of NAD${}^{+}$ biosynthesis and an intimate relationship to the signalling pathways. On the one hand, this information discloses crucial steps in the maintenance of cell homeostasis and proliferation; but on the other hand, it allows the identification of molecular events that can be targeted for therapeutic interventions, including cancer treatment.

**NAD${}^{+}$ biosynthesis**

The common step in all pathways of NAD${}^{+}$ generation is the formation of the dinucleotide that consists of AMP (the adenylate moiety of ATP) and a pyridine mononucleotide, nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN) (FIG. 2). In conditions in which ATP is abundantly available, NAD${}^{+}$ biosynthesis is mostly concerned with the generation of the pyridine mononucleotide from exogenous precursors. The build-up of the mononucleotides resembles the biosynthesis of other nucleotides. Nucleobases (such as nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinic acid (NA), which are

REVIEW S

At a glance
- NAD is an important redox factor and substrate in various signalling processes, in which it is irreversibly degraded to form molecules that are of key relevance to cellular homeostasis. Both NAD⁺-dependent metabolic and signalling pathways are altered in cancer cells, providing a number of potential drug targets.
- Permanent synthesis of NAD is essential to fuel bioenergetic processes and maintain balanced cell regulation. NAD⁺ is synthesized from vitamin B₃ (niacin, including both nicotinamide and nicotinic acid) and the corresponding nucleosides. However, the predominant source to maintain NAD levels is nicotinamide (Nam), which arises endogenously from NAD⁺-dependent signalling processes. Therefore, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT) is of outstanding importance, as it is the only human enzyme that salvages Nam into NAD⁺ synthesis. NamPRT inhibitors are currently under scrutiny to evaluate their potential in cancer therapy based on NAD⁺ depletion.
- Likewise, inhibitors of nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) have the potential to affect NAD levels, as these enzymes are required in all pathways of NAD⁺ generation. Moreover, the expression of the three human isoforms is tissue- and cell compartment-specific, suggesting the possibility of more specific therapeutic approaches. However, so far, specific and potent inhibitors are not available.
- Several NAD-dependent signalling pathways are involved in the control of cell cycle progression, transcriptional regulation and DNA repair and have therefore been identified as promising targets in cancer therapy. The NAD⁺-dependent protein deacetylases (Sirtuins) SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT6 and SIRT7 are also now of interest in the development of new cancer therapies.
- Inhibitors of polyADP ribose polymerases (PARPs) have a demonstrated potential in cancer therapy and have recently reached the clinical arena. Major current challenges in their use are selectivity towards specific PARP isoforms, potential impairment of DNA repair in healthy tissues and development of drug resistance.

collectively referred to as vitamin B₃ or niacin) or nucleosides (Nam riboside (NR) and NA riboside (NAR)) are converted to the corresponding mononucleotides, NMN and NAMN: Nam and NA by phosphoribosyltransferases, and NR and NAR by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRKs)⁶ (FIG. 2). NRKs can mediate cell survival in the presence of NR and NAR. There are two human NRK isoforms⁶, but it is unknown whether they have specialized functions. The next step, which is the formation of the dinucleotide by NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs), is shared by all NAD⁺ biosynthetic pathways (FIG. 2). There are three mammalian NMNAT isoforms, which have distinct tissue distributions and subcellular localizations⁷,⁸. When Nam is the predominant NAD⁺ precursor, these enzymes mostly catalyse the final step in NAD biosynthesis, and their distribution in cells probably reflects specific needs of NAD. Given the key role of NMNATs in NAD⁺ formation, their pharmacological targeting could be relevant to NAD-depleting therapeutic strategies (discussed below).

The classical Preiss–Handler pathway of NAD⁺ synthesis starts from NA⁹,¹⁰. This pathway is predominant in unicellular organisms and requires subsequent amidation of the NA moiety by NAD synthetase (FIG. 2). In mammalian cells, tryptophan can be used to generate NAD⁺ through the kynurenine pathway¹¹ (FIG. 2) but, unlike niacin precursors, tryptophan alone is insufficient to maintain normal levels of NAD. Most NAD⁺ in humans is synthesized from Nam. The conversion of Nam to NAD⁺ through Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT) is the most direct and economical route. Phosphoribosyltransferases require

phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) as a second substrate. In fast-dividing tissues and tumours, PRPP may become limiting for NAD generation because this molecule is also required for the biosynthesis of nucleotides that are essential for building DNA and RNA. However, the induction of PRPP synthetase expression is evident in transformed cells and might be a prerequisite for providing the building blocks for DNA duplication and cell growth¹²,¹³. Interestingly, the evolutionary occurrence of NamPRT seems to coincide with that of ADP ribosylation¹⁴, a major NAD⁺-consuming regulatory process in higher eukaryotes, which includes the release of Nam, the substrate of NamPRT. PolyADP ribosylation is considered as a rather active NAD⁺-consuming process¹⁵⁻¹⁷ and was proposed to be a major reason why the half-life of NAD⁺ in human cells can be as short as ~1 hour¹⁸. As indicated in BOX 1, the Nam released in NAD⁺-dependent signalling reactions needs to be completely recycled to maintain tissue NAD levels, and this requires NamPRT. NamPRT has been identified as the rate-limiting and most crucial NAD⁺ biosynthetic enzyme in mammalian physiology¹⁹⁻²¹. Unexpectedly, NamPRT is also present in the extracellular environment, with an apparent long-range function in signalling from adipose tissue to the pancreas²², although the plasma concentrations of the substrates (Nam, ATP and PRPP) are insufficient to support the reaction²³. NamPRT has also been demonstrated to interact with key components of the circadian clock, as well as the NAD⁺-dependent protein deacetylase SIRT1, to mediate oscillations of the tissue NAD⁺ levels in the liver²⁴,²⁵.

Even though there are nine different enzymes (including isoforms) involved in NAD⁺ synthesis, the possibilities of attacking cancers by limiting their NAD supply have not yet been fully exploited (discussed below).

### NAD⁺-dependent signalling pathways

The involvement of NAD⁺ in regulatory reactions was originally discovered on the basis of the ADP ribosyltransferase activity of bacterial toxins²⁶. Cholera and other bacterial toxins transfer the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD⁺ onto target proteins of their host cells (in the case of Cholera toxin, a stimulatory subunit of a G protein) and thereby modulate their functional properties (such as inhibition of GTPase activity). Similar reactions, as well as a number of other conversions involving the cleavage of NAD⁺, are a vital part of the endogenous cellular machinery that maintains homeostasis and regulates a variety of physiological processes.

Although there are different types of reactions by which NAD⁺ consumption contributes to cellular signalling, they all involve the release of Nam and the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety onto an acceptor. Thus, the attachment of a single ADP ribose to an amino acid residue of a protein is termed monoADP ribosylation. By contrast, polyADP ribosylation includes the generation of ADP-ribose polymers, which are most often found attached to acceptor proteins. As these polymers can be large (up to about 200 ADP-ribose units) and because each unit originates from a molecule of NAD⁺, it is

**a** | Major metabolic transformations in cancer cells are shown. Energy transduction in normal cells eventually leads to the oxidation of nutrients via oxidative phosphorylation. Glycolysis continuously generates pyruvate (Pyr), which is preferentially transported into mitochondria and further metabolized via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In cancer cells, a high rate of glycolysis is observed with highly increased glucose uptake even under normoxic conditions, while respiration remains almost unchanged (aerobic glycolysis). The ratio of NAD to NADH is balanced in favour of NAD (indicated in bold) in normal cells. In tumour cells, lactate dehydrogenase isoform A (LDHA) preferentially converts accumulating pyruvate to lactate, thereby regenerating NAD⁺ from NADH to maintain glycolysis. Excess lactate is secreted and contributes to an extracellular environment that promotes tumour progression. Based on the LDHA reaction, the accumulation of lactate in tumours implies an increase of NADH relative to NAD⁺: [Lactate]/[Pyr] ∝ [NADH][NAD⁺]¹³¹. An increase of the NADH/NAD⁺ redox ratio has also been reported in breast cancer cells, for example¹³². The high glycolytic rate and a tumour-specific increase of the less active pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) in cancer cells increases the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates, which are mostly diverted into the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP). As a result, NADPH is produced to counteract oxidative stress and to support biomass production. Moreover, building blocks for nucleic acid syntheses such as ribose-5-phosphate (Rib-5-P) are produced. A major mediator of the metabolic shift towards increased glycolytic flux is hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α).  
**b** | Sirtuins mediate tumour suppression by antagonizing HIF1α effects. HIF1α is highly expressed in a number of tumours and is stabilized under hypoxic conditions. It promotes tumour survival by, among others, inducing the expression of genes that encode glycolytic enzymes and glucose transporters. Some of the tumour suppressing roles of sirtuins have been associated with their antagonizing action on HIF1α. SIRT1 inactivates HIF1α by deacetylation and inhibits its nuclear translocation¹³³. SIRT6 functions as co-repressor of HIF1α and interferes with the interaction between p300 and HIF1α, thus inhibiting transcriptional activity¹³⁴. SIRT3 suppresses mitochondrial production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby promoting HIF1α destabilization⁷⁶,⁷⁷. Dashed, thin and thick arrows indicate the prevalence of the pathways and reactions.

obvious that activation of polyADP ribosylation can lead to a considerable challenge for the cellular NAD homeostasis. In turn, the depletion of NAD would also result in an immediate reduction of the capacity of a cell to generate ATP.

Another mechanism of NAD⁺-dependent protein modification mediates the removal of acetyl groups from proteins. Unlike other protein deacetylases, which hydrolyse the acetyl–protein bond, NAD⁺-dependent deacetylases (also known as sirtuins on the basis of the

original discovery of such a mechanism for the yeast silence information regulator 2 (Sir2)^(27–29)^ transfer the acetyl group onto ADP ribose and release Nam, thereby generating 2′-and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose (OAADPR)^(30)^.

In addition to protein modifications, NAD⁺ is also a precursor of Ca²⁺-mobilizing molecules. Both OAADPR and ADP ribose (the hydrolysis product of NAD⁺) are intracellular ligands of plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channels^(31)^. Moreover, NAD⁺ can be converted into cyclic

Figure 2 | The NAD metabolome in humans. a | NAD⁺ can be synthesized from various precursors containing the pyridine moiety. The bases nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinic acid (NA) are converted to their mononucleotides (nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) or nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NAMN)) by the corresponding phosphoribosyltransferase, Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT) or NAPRT, using phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) as a co-substrate. PRPP is also a substrate of quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase (QAPRT), which transforms the tryptophan (Trp)-derived intermediate quinolinic acid (QA) to NAMN in the de novo pathway. NMN and NAMN are also generated by the phosphorylation of the nucleosides, nicotinamide riboside (NR) and nicotinic acid riboside (NAR), respectively, by nicotinamide riboside kinases (NRKs). Formation of the dinucleotide (either NAD⁺ or NAAD) is the common step in all NAD⁺ biosynthetic routes. It is catalysed by NMN adenylyltransferases (NMNATs) and consists of the transfer of the adenylate moiety of ATP onto the mononucleotide. NAAD is amidated by NAD synthetase (NADS) using glutamine as an ammonium donor. b | There are three principal ways in which NAD⁺ is used. It can be reduced to NADH by accepting electrons from metabolic intermediates. These reactions are reversible and are not accompanied by a net loss of NAD. Phosphorylation by NAD kinase converts NAD⁺ to NADP⁺, which also has a variety of functions, including reactive oxygen species (ROS) defence, reductive biosynthesis, detoxification and oxidative burst in immune responses. Most NAD⁺-degrading processes are signalling reactions, which can be summarized as ADP-ribose (ADPR) transfer reactions. They include a reaction of the ADP-ribose moiety (FIG. 3) concomitant with the cleavage of the nicotinamide moiety, which is recycled into NAD⁺ synthesis by NamPRT. cADPR, cyclic ADPR; OAADPR, 2′-and 3′-O-acetyl-ADP-ribose.

Synthetic lethality

Two genes are synthetic lethal if mutation of either alone is compatible with viability but the mutation of both leads to death. Therefore, targeting a gene that is synthetic lethal to a cancer-relevant mutation should kill only cancer cells and should spare normal cells.

ADP ribose, which was identified as a ligand of the ryanodine receptor<sup>32</sup>, a Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in the endoplasmic reticulum. NAADP, the NA derivative of NADP, is another NAD<sup>+</sup>-derived Ca<sup>2+</sup> messenger<sup>33</sup>.

The scope of functions that are carried by NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling pathways is broad. Even within a class of reactions, there is an impressive diversity of functional outcomes. The individual NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling functions have been covered in excellent recent reviews, and several are cited below. Therefore, we only highlight pathways that are of particular interest with regard to tumour biology.

**CD38 and cancer.** The major NAD glycohydrolase and ADP-ribosyl cyclase (these enzymes produce ADPR, cyclic ADPR and NAADP) in mammals is CD38, an ectoenzyme that is most prominently found on the surface of blood cells. Despite this localization, *Cd38*<sup>−/−</sup> mice have a significantly increased NAD<sup>+</sup> content in a variety of tissues, suggesting that this enzyme mediates continuous NAD<sup>+</sup> degradation and thereby contributes to NAD homeostasis<sup>34</sup>. CD38 has been identified as a negative prognostic marker in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). However, the potential role of CD38 in neoplastic transformation and tumour progression remains unclear<sup>35</sup>. There are no potent drugs that specifically block CD38 activity and it is unknown whether CD38 inhibition might have a therapeutic effect<sup>36</sup>. However, CD38-specific antibodies have the potential to induce killing of neoplastic B cell lines<sup>37</sup> and have therefore been taken to clinical trials<sup>35</sup>.

**ADP ribosylation and cancer.** MonoADP ribosylation has been predominantly detected on the cell surface and seems to be particularly important in the immune system<sup>38</sup>. Whether this protein modification has any role in tumour biology is unknown. However, a recent study established that deletion of the *Arh1* gene, which encodes an enzyme that reverses monoADP

ribosylation of cell surface proteins, increased the incidences of lymphomas, adenocarcinomas and melanomas in mice<sup>39</sup>. Consequently, these observations suggest that deregulation of monoADP ribosylation may affect cancer development or progression.

In the context of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling in tumorigenesis, polyADP ribosylation is the most promising target for cancer therapy<sup>40</sup>. Poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) has been defined as the ‘guardian angel’ of DNA integrity<sup>41</sup>. Beyond its role in DNA repair, PARP1 can contribute to cell transformation by regulating the activity of key transcription factors that are involved in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis, such as p53 and nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)<sup>42,43</sup>. Given that the activity of these transcription factors is significantly affected by poly(ADP ribose) formation, NAD<sup>+</sup> consumption by PARP1 seems to be central in regulating transcriptional events that are relevant to neoplastic transformation. PARP1 also interacts and positively regulates the activity of kinases such as ERK and JUN activated N-terminal kinase (JNK)<sup>44</sup>, thereby promoting MAPK-dependent growth signalling. Recently, considerable research interest (reviewed in REFS 40,45,46) has been focused on the therapeutic potential of PARP1 inhibitors in cancer therapy. The rationale of targeting PARP1 in tumour cells is based on the key role of the enzyme in DNA single-strand break (SSB) repair. Normally, when PARP1 is inhibited, DNA SSB repair is blocked, but this can be circumvented by the activation of different DNA repair mechanisms, allowing for cell survival. However, cancer cells, which often show intrinsic deficits of DNA repair, can be more sensitive to the detrimental effect of PARP1 inhibitors<sup>47</sup>. This strategy of selective cytotoxicity is based on the concept of synthetic lethality<sup>48,49</sup>. A large body of experimental evidence confirms the ability of PARP1 inhibitors to kill cancer cells in which DNA repair is compromised<sup>50</sup>. Chemical inhibitors of PARP1 have been tested in clinical trials in patients with breast or ovarian cancer who have genetic inactivation

**Box 1 | The essential function of NamPRT to recycle Nam by NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling**

NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling conversions result in the degradation of the molecule and the release of nicotinamide (Nam). The maintenance of tissue NAD levels depends on a nearly complete salvage of Nam back into NAD<sup>+</sup>: the recommended nutritional intake of Nam is ~15 mg per day<sup>129</sup>, whereas the daily NAD<sup>+</sup> turnover in the liver alone is probably in the range of several grams (see the figure part a). The half-life of NAD<sup>+</sup> in the human cell line D98/AH-2 was measured to be as short as 1 hour<sup>18</sup>. Assuming a similar half-life and that the NAD<sup>+</sup> content in human liver (mass approximately 1.2–1.5 kg) is similar to that in rat liver (approximately 700 nmol per g of tissue<sup>130</sup>), the daily turnover would be ~6.5–8.5 g NAD<sup>+</sup> which is equivalent to about 1.5 g of Nam. Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT) is essential for Nam recycling, not only in the liver. Therefore, its inhibition represents the most powerful way to lower organismal NAD levels. As a consequence, to circumvent the toxicity of NamPRT inhibition (for example, by FK866), considerable quantities of alternative precursors (nicotinic acid (NA), NA riboside (NAR) or Nam riboside (NR)) would be required, because they would have to make up not just for the ~15 mg daily required intake, but primarily for the lack of Nam recycling (see the figure part b).

of the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes<sup>51–53</sup>. BRCA1 and BRCA2 are essential for DNA repair by homologous recombination (HR). Therefore, HR is inactive in tumours that have BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. In HR-proficient cells, SSBs that occur during the S phase of the cell cycle owing to PARP1 inhibition are transformed into double-strand breaks (DSB) that are readily repaired by HR. Conversely, in BRAC1- or BRCA2-deficient cancer cells, DSBs that are induced by PARP1 inhibition cannot be effectively repaired and this results in replication fork collapse and the induction of cell death<sup>50</sup>. Beyond BRCA deficiency, PARP1 inhibitors kill cancer cells bearing various defects in DNA repair mechanisms, thereby widening the antineoplastic potential of these chemicals. However, it seems that tumours can develop resistance to PARP1 inhibitors. Some of the mechanisms underlying this resistance are known and should enable alternative strategies to be developed to counteract resistance<sup>54</sup>. Notably, synthetic lethality could also be achieved by pharmacological inhibition of NAD synthesis. Indeed, NAD shortage can substantially compromise DNA repair by PARP1 and can therefore be functionally equivalent to direct targeting of PARP1.

Sirtuins and cancer. The discovery of NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylation, which is catalysed by proteins of the sirtuin family, has profoundly influenced the understanding of major biological processes. In particular, these enzymes establish a direct link between metabolic and bioenergetic homeostasis and gene regulation. The activity of sirtuins depends on the availability of NAD<sup>+</sup> or the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox ratio, and this sensing of the metabolic state is directly transformed into transcriptional adaptations by deacetylation of transcription factors or histones at specific gene loci<sup>55,56</sup>. In addition, several sirtuins directly regulate the catalytic activity of key metabolic enzymes such as the cytosolic and mitochondrial acetyl-CoA synthetases<sup>57,58</sup>.

In humans, seven members of the sirtuin family are known, some of which preferentially catalyse monoADP ribosylation of target proteins. SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7 are nuclear proteins, SIRT2 mainly localizes to the cytoplasm, and SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 are mitochondrial proteins. NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent deacetylation results in the modulation of target protein activity, stability or localization. SIRT1 in particular has been intensely studied and has been shown to mediate several physiologically favourable effects in various tissues. Increased activity of this protein counteracts the development of diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome, partly by inducing mitochondrial activation or proliferation through peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ, co-activator 1α (PCG1α; also known as PPARGC1A)-dependent mechanisms<sup>55,59,60</sup>.

Both SIRT1 and SIRT3 can reportedly act as tumour promoters or suppressors<sup>61,62</sup>. Increased expression levels of SIRT1 have been found in various cancer types<sup>62–64</sup>. Moreover, SIRT1 interacts with and modulates major regulators of tumour biology, such as p53 and FOXO transcription factors and reduces their pro-apoptotic effect. The identification of an endogenous SIRT1 inhibitor (deleted in breast cancer 1 (DBC1)) suggested

that increased SIRT1 activity favours tumour progression<sup>65,66</sup>. Conversely, it has been shown that the incidence and growth of β-catenin-driven intestinal tumours is reduced by SIRT1-mediated deacetylation of β-catenin<sup>67</sup>. Furthermore, BRCA1-mutant breast cancers have much less SIRT1 than BRCA wild-type breast cancers<sup>68</sup>, and tumour progression of BRCA1-mutated cancer cells is suppressed when SIRT1 levels are restored. Notably, calorific restriction, which activates SIRT1, also reduces cancer risk<sup>62</sup>. Mouse models used to investigate the role of SIRT1 in tumour development strongly support its function as a tumour suppressor<sup>69</sup>. These models have also confirmed the importance of the interplay between SIRT1 and p53. Double heterozygous *Sirt1*<sup>+/-</sup>;*Trp53*<sup>+/-</sup> mice had a high incidence of tumours, whereas the single heterozygous mice did not<sup>70</sup>. Although the interactions between these two important proteins are complex, a major mechanistic factor is the reduction of p53 activity on deacetylation by SIRT1 (REFS 71,72).

Tumour-promoting functions of SIRT3 were suggested because of its increased expression in several cancer tissues and cell lines. However, more recent reports support the conclusion that SIRT3 acts as a tumour suppressor on the basis of its central role as a regulator of mitochondrial and cellular metabolism and as a suppressor of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Most prominently, SIRT3 regulates superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2; also known as MnSOD) both directly (by deacetylation)<sup>73</sup> and indirectly (via transcription)<sup>74</sup>. It has become clear that loss of SIRT3 not only leads to increased ROS production and increased tumorigenesis<sup>75</sup>, but also that this loss contributes to the metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis that is mediated by increased ROS-dependent stabilization of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1α). In turn, glucose transport and glycolytic metabolism are activated<sup>76</sup> (FIG. 1b). Importantly, overexpression of SIRT3 was shown to decrease tumorigenesis in xenografts even after tumour initiation<sup>77</sup>. It is probable that the ROS-suppressing effects of SIRT3 may also be beneficial for tumour cells undergoing hypoxic stress<sup>78</sup>. The fact that both SIRT1 and SIRT3 have been identified as both tumour promoters and tumour suppressors indicates that the specific characteristics of the type of cancer or investigated model need to be carefully examined for each individual case<sup>61</sup>.

Tumour suppressor functions have been proposed for both SIRT2 and SIRT6. SIRT2 is downregulated in human gliomas<sup>79</sup>. Moreover, it facilitates the maintenance of genomic integrity and suppresses tumorigenesis<sup>80</sup>. SIRT6 is involved in DNA repair and also counteracts DNA damage<sup>81</sup>. Notably, it supports DNA double-strand break repair by monoADP ribosylation-dependent activation of PARP1 on genotoxic stress<sup>82</sup>. Thus, two seemingly independent classes of NAD<sup>+</sup>-consuming proteins, Sirtuins and PARPs, are linked, indicating the level of NAD<sup>+</sup> itself as a potentially important determinant of the ensuing signalling processes. Specifically, PARP1-dependent NAD consumption under both constitutive and stressful conditions limits SIRT1 activity<sup>83–85</sup>. However, it is currently unknown
whether PARP1 activity-dependent impairment of SIRT1 activity is relevant to cell transformation and/or tumour progression. SIRT6 overexpression was shown to induce apoptosis in cancer cells but not in normal cells, which suggested the activation of this protein as a promising strategy for cancer treatment<sup>86</sup>. SIRT6-induced apoptosis required ATM signalling and the ADP-ribosylation activity of SIRT6. Therefore, the authors proposed that the mechanism might include sensitization of cancer cells to DNA damage, possibly mediated by monoADP ribosylation of PARP1.

SIRT7 is upregulated in breast cancers<sup>87</sup>, as well as thyroid tumour biopsy samples and cell lines<sup>88,89</sup>. It activates RNA polymerase I, thereby promoting proliferation. Consequently, SIRT7 could potentially mediate malignant transformation. Moreover, this sirtuin consolidates the tumour phenotype by keeping acetylation of lysine 18 in histone 3 low<sup>90</sup>.

Taken together, SIRT1, SIRT3, SIRT6 and their downstream targets have moved into focus with regard to cancer therapy. Besides the development of direct effectors, their strict dependence on NAD<sup>+</sup> can additionally be exploited by modulating NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis. An important aspect relates to the role of these sirtuins in the regulation of cellular metabolism, especially with regard to the use of glucose. SIRT6, and possibly SIRT1, may function as epigenetic gatekeepers of glucose metabolism, and SIRT3 controls mitochondrial metabolism<sup>91</sup>. The central mechanistic link of these sirtuin functions is HIF1α (FIG. 1b). Given the glucose dependence of cancer cells, modulating the activity of these major sirtuins could also be exploited to suppress carcinogenesis by counteracting the Warburg effect.

### Distribution of NAD metabolism

A thorough understanding of the organ-specific distribution of NAD metabolic enzymes could provide important clues regarding the suitability of cancer treatments and the necessary complementary application of NAD precursors. Although a comprehensive picture of NAD metabolism and distribution has been proposed<sup>92</sup>, most of the currently available information concerning the levels of enzymes in different tissues is solely based on the quantification of mRNA levels. It is well known that microarray measurements have limited sensitivity and that mRNA levels do not necessarily correlate with protein levels. Nevertheless, some interesting conclusions can be drawn. Results and analyses of microarray studies can be retrieved from databases and platforms such as BioGPS<sup>93</sup> (see Further information). Based on the data available on this platform (as of March 2012), cases of tissue-specific expression or the suppression of genes involved in NAD metabolism are rare. As expected from early biochemical studies, the liver seems to be the major ‘hub’ of NAD metabolism, as it expresses all the known genes. In particular, liver cells can convert all precursors, NA, Nam and their ribosides, as well as tryptophan, to NAD<sup>+</sup>. NamPRT and NAPRT mRNA levels are particularly high in the liver. These findings suggest that NAD requirement and turnover in the liver are high (BOX 1). Moreover, they could also indicate that the liver serves as an organismal reservoir of NAD precursors by taking them from nutritional sources and converting them to other precursors that can be released into the bloodstream. Indeed, any NAD<sup>+</sup> precursor can be converted at least to Nam and NR<sup>94,95</sup>. This is in line with the ubiquitous expression of NamPRT<sup>96</sup> and at least one or two NMNAT isoforms. Conversely, NRKs seem to be expressed more selectively. Although NRK2 is highly expressed in the heart, its mRNA is hardly detectable in other tissues. High levels of NRK1 mRNA were found in the pancreas, thyroid and white blood cells. These observations point to specific requirements for NR or NAR that may be exploited in the treatment of cancers derived from these tissues. NMNAT2 was originally identified as brain specific<sup>97</sup>, and it seems to be important in distal nerve ends<sup>98</sup>. Indeed, according to microarray data, it is abundantly expressed in all areas of the brain and the pancreas. This rather restricted specificity of expression could have potential for NMNAT2 as a drug target.

The NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling processes currently most relevant for oncologists, sirtuin activity and poly-ADP ribosylation, seem to be ubiquitously expressed. PARP1 is expressed at considerable levels in all tissues. There are some tissue-specific variations of expression among the seven sirtuins. However, the possible relevance of these variations remains to be established.

On the basis of these considerations of mRNA levels, it is unlikely that targeting NAD metabolism in cancer therapy can be achieved without interfering with healthy tissues. Still, there are at least some tissues that could be protected. It is also important to bear in mind that several cancers exhibit specific changes in the expression of NAD metabolic genes. Therefore, the individual assessment of each type of cancer in this regard is crucial in the consideration of potential treatment.

In mammalian cells, NAD metabolism is compartmentalized (FIG. 3). Formation of NAD from NMN takes place within the nucleus and mitochondria<sup>78</sup>. It is also in these two compartments where most of the intra-cellular NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent signalling takes place. This might suggest that NAD<sup>+</sup> biosynthesis directly fuels the signalling reactions. At least for the nuclear enzymes PARP1 and NMNAT1, such a relationship has indeed been established: NMNAT1 physically binds to activated PARP1 and directly provides NAD<sup>+</sup> to PARP1 (REFS 99,100). As indicated in FIG. 3, the most likely cytosolic precursor for mitochondrial NAD<sup>+</sup> is NMN<sup>101</sup>, although direct entry of NAD<sup>+</sup> into mitochondria cannot be ruled out completely<sup>102,103</sup>. The sirtuins that have been most prominently connected to cancer biology are located in the nucleus (SIRT1, SIRT6 and SIRT7) or the mitochondria (SIRT3). Thus, NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent processes are intimately linked with most important molecular events in tumour development and progression: genomic rearrangements and transcriptional changes in the nucleus and metabolic alterations, particularly in the mitochondria. For example, nuclear SIRT1 is a major regulator of genes that encode mitochondrial proteins, and changes in its activity may thereby contribute to the consolidation of metabolic shifts.

Figure 3 | Subcellular compartmentation of NAD synthesis and signalling. The subcellular distribution of NAD⁺ biosynthetic enzymes in mammalian cells is shown on the left-hand side of the figure. All known biosynthetic reactions can take place in the cytosol, although conversion of nicotinamide (Nam) to NAD⁺ also takes place in the nucleus. However, NAD⁺ and its biosynthetic intermediates are likely to be freely exchangeable between the cytosol and the nucleus. Mitochondria contain nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) adenylyltransferase (NMNAT) activity and can therefore generate NAD⁺ from NMN. An extracellular form of Nam phosphoribosyltransferase (NamPRT), known as eNamPRT (also known as visfatin), is secreted from adipose tissue. Pyridine bases (Nam and nicotinic acid (NA)) and nucleosides (such as Nam riboside (NR)) enter cells by different transport mechanisms. The compartments of predominant NAD⁺ generation, the nucleus and mitochondria, also harbour the majority of intracellular NAD⁺-dependent signalling processes (right-hand side of the figure). Nuclear poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) generates polyADP ribose and probably accounts for the majority of nuclear NAD⁺ degradation. Direct interaction with NMNAT1 facilitates NAD⁺ supply to activated PARP1. Members of the sirtuin family are found in the nucleus, the cytosol and the mitochondria. SIRT1 is a key regulator of gene expression by deacetylating histone and non-histone targets such as p53. SIRT6 is also a nuclear protein. Among others, it activates PARP1, thereby facilitating DNA repair. SIRT7 is mostly localized to the nucleolus. SIRT2 localizes to the cytosol. SIRT3, SIRT4 and SIRT5 are located in mitochondria. SIRT3 is the major deacetylase in these organelles and a key regulator of metabolic pathways, including β-oxidation of fatty acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA). Moreover, it deacetylates and activates superoxide dismutase 2 (SOD2), thereby suppressing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. CD38, the main mammalian NAD⁺ glycohydrolase, and the majority of monoADP ribosyltransferases (mARTs) are found on the cell surface. All signalling reactions generate Nam as a common product, which can be recycled into the NAD⁺ biosynthesis pathway by NamPRT.

**Targeting NAD⁺ synthesis in cancer cells**

Two prototypical features of cancer cells are increased ATP synthesis and metabolic shift towards massive production of biomass¹,³. Even tumours driven by deregulation of the RAS- or MYC-dependent pathways undergo changes in glucose metabolism that are essential for their progression¹⁰⁴. Although increased ATP synthesis is mainly due to aerobic glycolysis, biomass generation requires complex rearrangements of intermediate metabolism. Among these rearrangements, the increased flux through the pentose phosphate pathway is considered particularly important for sustaining biosynthesis in cancer cells² (FIG. 1). On this basis, it is conceivable that limiting NAD availability would counteract the metabolic changes that promote the growth of cancer cells. Indeed, reduced NAD concentrations could restrict the activity of the NAD-dependent enzymes, such as glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, an enzyme that is required for glycolysis. Lowering cellular NAD concentrations might also affect NAD kinase activity and thereby the availability of NADP, an essential molecule that drives the pentose phosphate pathway. As a consequence, nucleotide synthesis and DNA duplication would be affected, because of reduced production of ribose 5-phosphate.

Impairment of the pentose phosphate pathway by inducing NADP shortage is expected to compromise cancer cell growth through an additional mechanism. It has been proposed that the cancer cell-specific increase in the expression of pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2; a poorly active isoform of PK) is selected for, because it enables glucose to be directed into the pentose phosphate pathway (FIG. 1). This mechanism boosts NADPH production to increase redox-buffering capacity and protects cancer cells from ROS-induced damage²,¹⁰⁵. Reducing NAD availability would therefore render tumours more sensitive to oxidative damage, a condition that predisposes to apoptosis. In theory, no matter what the genetic, signalling or metabolic alterations underlying cancer development are, all tumours rely on increased central carbon metabolism and biomass production to sustain unrestricted growth¹. Consequently, antineoplastic

strategies that target NAD⁺ formation are expected to  
be effective in a vast number of tumours.

In addition to the negative impact on metabolic  
rearrangements that fuel cancer growth, reduced avail-  
ability of NAD can halt tumour progression by limiting  
the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes. For example,  
reduced PARP1-dependent polyADP ribosylation owing  
to NAD⁺ shortage functionally mimics the antineoplas-  
tic effects of PARP inhibitors. Similarly, the prosurvival  
signals that are sustained by sirtuin activity are impaired  
in conditions of NAD⁺ scarcity, thereby predisposing to  
apoptosis. Inhibition of NAD⁺-degrading enzymes by  
limiting substrate availability implies that, under basal  
conditions, their activities are limited by intracellular free  
NAD⁺ concentrations. The involvement of NAD⁺ con-  
centrations is a debated issue, because knowledge of the  
real concentrations of free (that is, not protein-bound)  
pyridine nucleotides in different cells and subcellular  
compartments is still limited. Emerging evidence, how-  
ever, demonstrates that strategic interactions that exist  
between NAD⁺-consuming and NAD⁺-synthesizing  
enzymes can provide NAD⁺ in an assisted or an on-  
demand manner^{99,100}. However, this indicates that meta-  
bolic and topographic limitations are imposed by the  
scarcity of free NAD and/or its inefficient resynthesis.  
Conversely, it corroborates the hypothesis that reducing  
intracellular NAD pools significantly affects metabolism  
and signalling in cancer cells.

An obvious potential drawback of killing tumours by  
NAD shortage is systemic toxicity. Some hope for tumour  
specificity is based on the overexpression of specific NAD-  
generating enzymes, such as NMNATs and NamPRT by  
tumour cells. Evidence for the role of NMNATs in can-  
cer was first reported in 1956. Specifically, the NMNAT-  
dependent rate of NAD⁺ synthesis in mouse mammary  
carcinoma cells was reduced to about one-fifth of that  
evident in normal mammary cells^{106}. These observations  
corroborate the hypothesis that targeting NMNATs in  
cancer cells can be exploited for tumour killing by mak-  
ing cancer cells more sensitive to drugs that inhibit NAD⁺  
synthesis^{107}. Unfortunately, only a few NMNAT inhibitors  
have so far been described. Gallotannin, a polyphenolic  
compound, inhibits recombinant isoforms of the three  
NMNATs at micromolar concentrations^{7}. Lower inhibi-  
tory potency has been reported for five synthetic NAD  
analogues that have a certain degree of selectivity for the  
three isoforms^{108}. Although these molecules are highly  
hydrophilic and do not have the potential to be active  
in vivo, they might be considered as leads in develop-  
ing potent and isoform-selective NMNAT inhibitors.  
NMNATs are also important for another strategy of can-  
cer treatment: they participate in the activation of anti-  
neoplastic prodrugs, such as tiazofurin and analogues.  
These compounds are converted to their respective  
dinucleotides by NRK and NMNAT activities, using the  
pathway of NAD⁺ synthesis from NR. These dinucleo-  
tides interfere with NAD metabolism, but are also potent  
inhibitors of IMP dehydrogenase^{109}, a crucial enzyme in  
purine nucleotide synthesis. Tiazofurin-like compounds  
are highly toxic^{110}, a feature that has severely limited their  
use in cancer treatment^{111}.

NamPRT is currently the only enzyme of mamma-  
lian NAD⁺ biosynthesis for which highly specific and  
potent inhibitors are available. These inhibitors have not  
only been instrumental in the study of this enzyme and  
NAD homeostasis in general, but they also have poten-  
tial as anticancer agents. NamPRT levels are significantly  
increased in a number of tumours^{64,112}, and NamPRT  
has been implicated in vasculogenesis^{113} and inflamma-  
tion^{22,114}. Thus, targeting NamPRT in cancer patients is  
expected to bring about pleiotypic antitumour effects  
in addition to direct impairment of cancer cell metabo-  
lism (FIG. 4). The first chemical found to inhibit NamPRT,  
FK866 (also known as APO866), was identified in a  
screen for antiproliferative agents, and its action could  
be ascribed to a considerable drop in cellular NAD⁺  
concentration^{115}. FK866 is a potent NamPRT inhibitor,  
the inhibition constant (Ki) being in the low nanomolar  
range^{115}. Remarkably, FK866 is much less toxic in non-  
tumour cell cultures. Similarly, high sensitivity to the  
drug is displayed by leukaemia and lymphoma cells, but  
not by normal haematopoietic progenitors. NamPRT  
inhibition also stops the growth of various tumour xeno-  
grafts, showing no evident adverse effects^{112}. The cyano-  
guanidine compound GMX1777 (previously known as  
CHS828) is converted into the active form GMX1778,  
which, in turn, is phosphoribosylated by NamPRT. The  
resulting compound still inhibits the enzyme but cannot  
exit the cell, possibly leading to long-lasting blockade of  
NAD resynthesis. Although it is capable of killing cultured  
cancer cells and tumour xenografts, GMX1778 is lethal  
in mice treated for 24 hours at a high dose^{116}, probably  
because Nam recycling is vital for most organs. However,  
the supplementation of mice with NA to circumvent the  
requirement for Nam as a NAD⁺ precursor, prevented  
death in the treated mice, and the drug was still able to  
kill tumours that were unable to metabolize NA, such as  
NAPRT-deficient glioblastoma and neuroblastoma^{116}. To  
adequately compensate for the suspected high rate of Nam  
salvage in the healthy tissues (BOX 1), considerable amounts  
of alternative NAD⁺ precursors would be required when  
NamPRT is systemically inhibited. Indeed, for humans,  
a daily dose of at least several grams of alternative NAD  
precursors might be required (BOX 1). This would prob-  
ably rule out NA as a supplement because of its adverse  
effects at higher doses^{117}. Notably, GMX1777 potentiates  
the effects of radiotherapy in vitro and in vivo^{116,118}, and  
FK866 and GMX1777 inhibit angiogenesis in tumour  
models^{119,120}. CB30865 and its analogues are additional  
NamPRT inhibitors that have antitumour effects^{121}.

Several clinical trials have been conducted to exploit  
the antitumoural effects of NamPRT inhibitors^{122–125} (see  
ClinicalTrials.gov; see Further information). FK866 was  
well tolerated and safe when tested in a Phase I study in  
patients with advanced cancers, with thrombocytopenia  
being the unique dose-limiting toxic effect. Although no  
objective tumour response was observed, four patients had  
stable disease for at least 3 months. Reductions in lesion  
size were also observed for some patients. Two additional  
trials to assess FK866 effects in patients with B cell chronic  
lymphocytic leukaemia that was refractory to treatment  
or advanced melanoma have been completed but have

REVIEWS

NamPRT inhibitors sensitize cancer cells both to genotoxic drugs and to radiotherapy that typically activate the NAD⁺-consuming DNA repair response. This might potentiate tumour killing, decrease resistance and allow a reduction in the dose of chemotherapeutics or radiation to diminish side effects. In turn, PARP1-dependent NAD⁺ depletion prompted by DNA damage would unmask a condition of impaired NAD⁺ resynthesis, thereby boosting the detrimental effects of NamPRT inhibitors on cancer cell metabolism. It is worth noting that NamPRT inhibitors, and in general NAD-depleting agents, could also be exploited to increase the antitumour efficacy of metabolic blockers such as metformin, 2-deoxyglucose and dichloroacetate. In keeping with this suggestion, FK866 potentiates the anticancer effects of a small-molecule inhibitor of lactate dehydrogenase A, thereby inducing lymphoma regression in mice¹²⁸. Additionally, given that different types of kinase inhibitors compromise cancer cell metabolism by decreasing glucose uptake, NAD-depleting agents could also boost clinically relevant effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitors.

In conclusion, on the basis of NAD metabolism, new principal strategies for cancer treatment can be deduced. Pharmacological restriction of NAD availability, that is, the inhibition of its synthesis, would generally limit the activities of NAD⁺-dependent signalling pathways and would additionally exhaust the energetic resources for proliferation. Conversely, tumour therapies could preferentially attack mitochondrial (NMNAT3 and SIRT3) or nuclear (NMNAT1, PARPs, SIRT1 and SIRT7) NAD metabolism. Targeting mitochondrial or nuclear NAD metabolism would target cancer-specific alterations and would therefore require careful analyses of individual cancer types and their susceptibility because there seems to be a considerable variation of NAD-dependent processes in different tumours. However, a clear advantage of highly selective inhibitors would be the chance of reduced side effects.

Inhibition of NamPRT has proven potential for cancer treatment. However, the development of potent and specific drugs that target other enzymes of NAD⁺ synthesis still constitutes a major challenge. In light of this, as there are several NMNAT isoforms showing tissue-specific expression (such as selective expression of NMNAT2 in the central nervous system and pancreas), the development of isoform-selective NMNAT inhibitors might well represent an important goal in the near future. Selective inhibition of NMNAT isoforms would potentially lower the burden of systemic toxicity and could be combined with moderate inhibition of NamPRT or specific NAD⁺-dependent signalling pathways. Toxicity caused by inhibition of NamPRT could possibly be circumvented by using NAD⁺ biosynthesis precursors other than Nam. This option deserves further exploration.

Finally, to better understand the therapeutic potential of NAD-depleting agents in cancer patients, it will be essential to stratify patients that are to be enrolled in clinical trials by expression profiling and accurate metabolic profiling by means of positron emission tomography to have information about glucose uptake in tumours and/or magnetic resonance spectroscopy.
