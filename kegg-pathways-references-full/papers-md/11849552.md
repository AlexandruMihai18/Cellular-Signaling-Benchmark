## Summary

In the cyanobacterium *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803, genes for Ni²⁺, Co²⁺, and Zn²⁺ resistance are grouped in a 12 kb gene cluster. The *nrsBACD* operon is composed of four genes, which encode proteins involved in Ni²⁺ resistance. Upstream from *nrsBACD*, and in opposite orientation, a transcription unit formed by the two genes *rppA* and *rppB* has been reported previously to encode a two-component signal transduction system involved in redox sensing. In this report, we demonstrate that *rppA* and *rppB* (here redesignated *nrsR* and *nrsS* respectively) control the Ni²⁺-dependent induction of the *nrsBACD* operon and are involved in Ni²⁺ sensing. Thus, expression of the *nrsBACD* operon was not induced by Ni²⁺ in a *nrsRS* mutant strain. Furthermore, *nrsRS* mutant cells showed reduced tolerance to Ni²⁺. Whereas the *nrsBACD* operon is transcribed from two different promoters, one constitutive and the other dependent on the presence of Ni²⁺ in the medium, the *nrsRS* operon is transcribed from a single Ni²⁺-inducible promoter. The *nrsRS* promoter is silent in a *nrsRS* mutant background suggesting that the system is autoregulated. Purified full length NrsR protein is unable to bind to the *nrsBACD-nrsRS* intergenic region; however, an amino-terminal truncated protein that contains the DNA binding domain of NrsR binds specifically to this region. Our *nrsRS* mutant, which carries a deletion of most of the *nrsR* gene and part of the *nrsS* gene, does not show redox imbalance or photosynthetic gene mis-expression, contrasting with the previously reported *nrsR* mutant.

## Introduction

Increasing interest has been developed during the last years on the biological roles of nickel and the structure of nickel metalloenzymes (Maroney, 1999). Ni atoms form part of the active site of a number of enzymes including glyoxalases I, peptide deformylases, methyl-CoM reductase and ureases, as well as some superoxide dismutases and hydrogenases (Ermler *et al.*, 1998). However, at high concentration, Ni²⁺ ions induce different types of harmful effects including generation of free radicals, inhibition of enzyme activity and DNA damage, leading to genetic instability, developmental defects and cancer (Von Burg, 1997; Costa, 1991, 1998). Because of these opposite effects, organisms have to carefully regulate the intracellular concentration of Ni²⁺.

Microbial Ni²⁺ uptake is mediated by non-specific transport systems for divalent cations and by high affinity specific systems (for two recent reviews, see Nies, 1999; Eitinger and Mandrand-Berthelot, 2000). Two types of high affinity transporters have been identified: (i) multicomponent ABC (ATP-binding cassette) transport systems (such as the NikABCDE system of *Escherichia coli*) (Navarro *et al.*, 1993); and (ii) one-component permeases (such as NixA, UreH, HupN and HoxN) (Eitinger and Friedrich, 1991; Fu *et al.*, 1994; Mobley *et al.*, 1995) which are integral membrane proteins with eight transmembrane spanning helices. Most of the one-component permeases have been shown to share a conserved His-X₄-Asp-His sequence in the second transmembrane helix involved in Ni²⁺ ligation. In the case of the Nik system, the periplasmic NikA protein is also involved in Ni²⁺ binding but the amino acid determinant of the interaction has not yet been identified. Beside these uptake systems, various Ni²⁺ export systems have also been described. The best known nickel resistance systems belong to bacteria of the genus *Ralstonia*. The Cnr (cobalt, nickel) and the Ncc (nickel, cobalt, cadmium) systems are membrane protein complexes that carry out Ni²⁺ efflux driven by proton/cation antiport (Collard *et al.*, 1993; Liesegang *et al.*, 1993; Schmidt and Schlegel, 1994; Grass *et al.*, 2000). Both systems are closely related to the cobalt/zinc/cadmium resistance system Czc from *Ralstonia* sp. CH34 strain. In this system, CzcA is the transmembrane protein that carries out the antiport. CzcB is a membrane fusion protein that may span the peri-plasmic space and CzcC seems to be attached to the outer membrane (Nies, 1992; 1995; Rensing *et al.*, 1997).

Fig. 1. ORF organization of the metal-resistance gene cluster from *Synechocystis*. The *nrsBACD* operon was described in García-Domínguez et al. (2000), the *corR* (*coaR*) and *corT* (also called *coaT*) genes were described in Rutherford et al., 1999 and García-Domínguez et al. (2000), and the *zia* genes were described in Thelwell et al. (1998). Cyanobase database ORFs numbers are also included (Kaneko et al., 1996).

In the unicellular cyanobacterium *Synechocystis* sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter referred to as *Synechocystis*), a nickel resistance operon (*nrsBACD*) formed by four open reading frames (ORFs) has been described previously by us (García-Domínguez et al., 2000). NrsB and NrsA proteins are homologues to CzcB and CzcA, respectively, and they very probably form a membrane-bound protein complex catalysing Ni²⁺ efflux by a proton/cation antiport. NrsC is not homologous to proteins encoded by the *czc* or related operons, and its role in Ni²⁺ export is unknown. Finally, NrsD is a membrane protein belonging to the major facilitator superfamily of transport proteins. NrsD is highly homologous to NreB from *Achromobacter xylosoxidans* (Grass et al., 2001). Expression of NreB in *E. coli* confers resistance to Ni²⁺, suggesting that this permease is able to carry out Ni²⁺ export. Interestingly the carboxy terminal part of NrsD contains 14 histidine residues involved in Ni²⁺ binding (García-Domínguez et al., 2000). The *nrsBACD* operon is integrated into the *Synechocystis* metal resistance cluster which includes nine genes involved in Zn²⁺, Co²⁺ and Ni²⁺ resistance (Fig. 1) (Thelwell et al., 1998; Rutherford et al., 1999; García-Domínguez et al., 2000). Two ORFs, *rppA* (sll0797) and *rppB* (sll0798), are found 118 bp upstream from the *nrsBACD* operon and transcribed in the opposite direction (Fig. 1). Whereas *rppA* encodes a response regulator, *rppB* encodes a sensor histidine kinase, suggesting that both proteins form a classical two-component signal transduction system (Stock et al., 2000). A role of these two proteins on redox sensing has been postulated previously, based on the analysis of an insertional mutant of the response regulator *rppA*. However, the same phenotype was not obtained in a mutant of the sensor histidine kinase *rppB* (Li and Sherman, 2000).

In this work, we demonstrate that the signal transduction system formed by the *rppA* and *rppB* products is controlling the expression of the *nrsBACD* operon, and is involved in Ni²⁺ sensing. A *rppAB* mutant with a deletion of most of the *rppA* gene and part of the *rppB* gene did not show any kind of redox imbalance, suggesting that the previously reported phenotype is the consequence of unspecific cross-talk. Therefore, we propose the redesignation of *rppAB* as *nrsRS*.

Results

Ni²⁺-dependent expression of *nrsR* and *nrsS* genes

The stop codon of the *nrsR* (sll0797) gene overlaps with the start codon of the *nrsS* (sll0798) gene, strongly suggesting that they form a single transcription unit. This was further demonstrated by the size of the mRNA transcript detected in Northern blotting experiments (about 2000 nucleotides). Metal-dependent expression of the *nrsRS* operon was analysed by Northern blotting. For this, a probe of the *nrsRS* operon was used to hybridize total RNA obtained from mid-log *Synechocystis* cells grown in BG11C medium and exposed for 1 h to 17 μM of either ZnSO₄, CdCl₂, CoCl₂, CuSO₄, NiSO₄ or MgCl₂. Control cells were not exposed to added metals. As shown in Fig. 2A, the *nrsRS* transcript was strongly induced in the presence of Ni²⁺ and weakly induced in the presence of Co²⁺. Therefore, the *nrsRS* operon follows the same pattern of expression as the *nrsBACD* operon (Fig. 2A). A time-course experiment demonstrated that *nrsRS* and *nrsBACD* transcripts showed different inducibility. Thus, the amount of the *nrsBACD* transcript increased about 10 fold, 4 h after Ni²⁺ addition, whereas the amount of the *nrsRS* mRNA increased only threefold after Ni²⁺ addition (Fig. 2B).

The *nrsRS* system controls the Ni²⁺-dependent expression of the *nrsBACD* operon

To identify the signal transduced by the *nrsRS* two-component system, a *nrsRS* mutant was generated by replacing most of the *nrsR* sequence and part of the *nrsS* sequence by a kanamycin resistance cassette (C.K1) in both orientations (Fig. 3A and B). Similar results were obtained for both mutants and, therefore, only data about the mutant with the kanamycin resistance gene (*npt*) in the opposite orientation with respect to the *nrsRS* genes are shown, except when indicated. The *nrsRS::C.K1* *Synechocystis* strain was viable and its growth rate in BG11C medium was similar to that of the wild-type strain (data not shown). As expression of the *nrsRS* operon is induced in the presence of Ni²⁺ and Co²⁺, growth of *nrsRS::C.K1* mutant was examined in Ni²⁺ and

(NrsBACD). Thus, Northern blotting experiments demonstrated that the Ni²⁺-dependent inducibility of the nrsBACD operon was completely abolished in the nrsRS::C.K1 mutant (Fig. 3D).

### Analysis of the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region

The 118 bp-nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region should contain the promoter and the regulatory sequences responsible for the response to Ni²⁺. To identify the promoters of both nrsRS and the nrsBACD operons, transcription start-points were determined by primer extension (Fig. 4A). In the absence of Ni²⁺, one only transcription start site was found 49 bp upstream of the nrsB ATG start codon. This transcription start-point was unaltered in the nrsRS::C.K1 mutants. However, in the presence of Ni²⁺, two different mRNAs were found. One starts in the same position as the transcript found under non-induced conditions. The second, much more abundant than the previous one, starts 33 bp upstream of the nrsBATG start codon. The inducible transcription start site was absent in the nrsRS::C.K1 mutant. These data indicate that the nrsBACD operon has two promoters; one constitutive and a second one inducible by the nrsRS system in the presence of Ni²⁺. Putative -10 boxes in the form TTTCAT and CAGACT were found 7 and 6 bp upstream of the Ni²⁺-independent and the Ni²⁺-dependent transcription start-points respectively. No obvious -35 boxes were detected at the appropriated positions (Fig. 4C).

Primer extension analysis demonstrated the existence of one only transcription start point for the nrsRS transcription unit 10 bp upstream of the nrsR translation start codon (Fig. 4B). As shown in RNA blotting experiments, primer extension products from the nrsRS promoter were more abundant in samples from cells exposed to Ni²⁺, than in non-exposed cells. Ni²⁺-dependent transcription from the nrsRS promoter was abolished in the nrsRS::C.K1 mutants indicating that expression of nrsRS genes is autoregulated. A putative -10 box in the form CGTTAT was found 5 bp upstream of the transcription start point (Fig. 4C).

### NrsR binds to the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region

NrsR belongs to the PhoB/OmpR subfamily of response regulators (Martinez-Hackert and Stock, 1997). Most response regulators consist of multiple domains: an N-terminal receiver domain that contains the aspartic residue that is phosphorylated by the histidine kinase and a C-terminal output domain that often binds DNA and activates transcription. To verify whether NrsR is able to interact with the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region, we purified

a recombinant amino-terminal His-tagged version of NrsR expressed in E. coli (Fig. 5A and B). DNA binding was tested by gel retardation assays using a fragment encompassing the 118 bp nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region. Full-length NrsR was not able to bind to this region (Fig. 5C), even in the presence 100 mM of acetyl phosphate. Similar results were obtained using a carboxy terminal His-tagged NrsR protein (data not shown). In a number of cases, it has been proposed that the unphosphorylated receiver domain functions as an intramolecular repressor of the DNA binding and transactivation activities of the N-terminal domain (Baikalo et al., 1996; Ames et al., 1999). This repressive effect is naturally released upon phosphorylation. A repressive role has been further supported by the fact that deletion of the N-terminal receiver domain leads to a constitutive DNA binding activity (Perez-Martín and de Lorenzo, 1996; Ellison and McCleary, 2000). Therefore, we generated a truncated form of NrsR deleted from the first 117 amino acids of the N-terminal part (Fig. 5A and

B). This truncated version, named NrsRΔN, bound specifically to the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region (Fig. 5C). The NrsRΔN-dependent band shift was severely diminished in the presence of a 10-fold excess of the same unlabelled fragment and it was unaffected by the presence of an excess of an unrelated DNA fragment (data not shown).

The nrsRS::C.K1 Synechocystis strain showed normal expression of photosynthetic genes

Li and Sherman have previously reported the inactivation of the rppA (nrsR) and rppB (nrsS) genes by insertional mutagenesis (Li and Sherman, 2000). Surprisingly, whereas ΔrppA cells showed a pleiotropic phenotype characterized by reduced chlorophyll and phycobiliprotein content and mis-expression of photosynthetic genes, ΔrppB cells behaved as wild-type cells. Thus, expression of the psbA (gene encoding the D1 protein of photosystem II) and nblA (gene encoding a polypeptide involved

nrsRS::C.K1(+) cell versus 33 ± 3.10⁻³ μg Chl μg⁻¹ total protein for the wild-type cells) and phycobiliprotein (PC) content (306 ± 35.10⁻³ μg PC μg⁻¹ total protein for the nrsRS::C.K1 cell versus 352 ± 11.10⁻³ μg PC μg⁻¹ total protein for the wild-type cells). Furthermore, Northern blot experiments using *psbA* and *nblA* probes demonstrated that both genes were equally expressed in *nrsRS::C.K1* and wild-type cells (Fig. 6). Therefore, our results contrast with the data published for the Δ*rppA* mutant strain. Taking into account our results, one simple explanation could be that the pleiotropic phenotype reported for the Δ*rppA* mutant was the consequence of a high intracellular accumulation of Ni²⁺ and that this phenotype was not observed in the *nrsRS::C.K1* mutant because of differences in the Ni²⁺ concentration of our BG11C medium. To test this hypothesis, expression of *nblA* and *psbA* genes was analysed in the presence of a growth-inhibitory Ni²⁺ concentration. Three different mutants presenting low tolerance to Ni²⁺ were analysed: *nrsRS::C.K1*, *nrsA::C.K1* and *nrsD::C.K1* (García-Domínguez et al., 2000). As shown in Fig. 6, neither *nblA* nor *psbA* gene expression was affected by the Ni²⁺ concentration in any of the analysed strains.

### Discussion

We have reported previously that *Synechocystis* contains a metal resistance gene cluster formed by nine genes involved in Ni²⁺, Co²⁺ and Zn²⁺ resistance (García-Domínguez et al., 2000). The Co- and Zn-dependent P-type ATPases, encoded by the genes *corT* (also called *coaT*) and *ziaA*, are regulated in a metal-dependent way by transcription factors also encoded by genes of the cluster (*corR/coaR* and *ziaR*) (Thelwell et al., 1998; Rutherford et al., 1999; García-Domínguez et al., 2000) (see Fig. 1). However, genes controlling the Ni²⁺-dependent induction of the nickel resistance system (*nrsBACD*) were unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that ORFs sll0797 (*nrsR*) and sll0798 (*nrsS*) also form part of the same gene cluster and constitute a two-component signal transduction system involved in Ni²⁺ sensing and regulation of the *nrsBACD* operon. Thus, the *nrsRS::C.K1* mutant displays a reduced tolerance to Ni²⁺ and it is unable to induce the *nrsBACD* operon in the presence of Ni²⁺. Whereas the carboxy terminal part of the NrsS protein shares homology with the histidine kinases of the PhoR subfamily, the amino terminal half appears to be a periplasmic domain, as predicted by two possible transmembrane helices (amino acids 14–34 and 187–214). This putative periplasmic domain shows significant sequence similarity with the alpha subunit of the methyl CoM reductase (MCR) from several Methanobacteria (Ermler et al., 1997) (Fig. 7). MCR is the final step enzyme of the methanogenesis pathway and it catalyses the

reduction of methyl-CoM to methane. Interestingly, one of the prosthetic groups of the enzyme is a tetrapyrrole ring of coenzyme $F_{430}$ which coordinates a nickel atom. In addition to the four tetrapyrrole nitrogens, nickel is also coordinated by a Gln residue of the MCR alpha subunit (marked in Fig. 7) (Ermler et al., 1997) which is located in the region that aligns with the NrsS periplasmic domains. These data raise the interesting possibility that the Ni²⁺-sensing domain of NrsS is phylogenetically related to the MCR alpha subunit. Whether the periplasmic domain of NrsS contains a tetrapyrrole ring involved in Ni²⁺ binding is currently unknown. NrsR is a response regulator of the OmpR/PhoB subfamily (Martinez-Hackert and Stock, 1997). PhoB-like factors contain two functional domains, an N-terminal phosphorylation domain (receiver domain) and a C-terminal DNA-binding/transactivation domain. In several cases, it has been demonstrated that phosphorylation of the receiver domain induces dimerization and binding to the DNA, whereas unphosphorylated proteins are unable to bind DNA (Fiedler and Weiss, 1995; Baikalov et al., 1996; Da Re et al., 1999). It has also been shown that deletion of the receiver domain yields proteins that can bind to the DNA constitutively, suggesting that the unphosphorylated receiver domain functions as an intramolecular repressor of the DNA binding; (Perez-Martin and de Lorenzo, 1996; Ellison and McCleary, 2000). In agreement with this view, recombinant NrsR purified from E. coli was unable to bind to the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region; however, a mutant protein deleted of the first 117 amino acids bound specifically to this region. PhoB binds DNA tandemly to two direct repeated sequences placed around 10 bp upstream

Upon sequence examination, two direct repeats in the form GA(T/A)TTTCA, separated by 3 bp, were found 12 bp upstream of the –10 box of the inducible nrsBACD promoter (Fig. 4B). In the same region, but in the opposite strand, two direct repeats also separated by 3 bp, and related to the previous one (GAAA(T/A)TC(A/T), were found 22 bp upstream of the –10 box of the nrsRS promoter (Fig. 4C). The long distance between the activator site and the nrsRS –10 box might account for the lower inducibility of the nrsRS promoter with respect to the

nrsBACD promoter (see Fig. 2B). Thus, this sequence analysis suggests that four binding sites for NrsR monomers may exist in the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region. Therefore, our current model suggests that the presence of Ni²⁺ in the medium stimulates the kinase activity of NrsS which transfers a phosphate group to NrsR. Phosphorylated NrsR binds (probably as a dimer) to the nrsRS-nrsBACD intergenic region activating the transcription of nrsBACD genes and positively autoregulating its own synthesis.

Our results concerning the role of the NrsR and NrsS proteins contrast with those of Li and Sherman (2000). Their nrsR insertional mutant (∆rppA) presents a redox imbalance characterized by altered levels of phycobiliproteins and chlorophylls, upregulation of genes encoding photosystem II proteins, downregulation of genes encoding photosystem I proteins and a 100-fold induction of the nblA gene (NblA is a small polypeptide involved in degradation of phycobiliproteins). Strikingly, the nrsS mutant (∆rppB) showed wild-type phenotype. To explain this result, the authors suggest that RppA may be phosphorylated by another histidine kinase. Our nrsRS::C.K1 mutant harbours a replacement of most of the nrsR sequence and part of the nrsS sequence by a kanamycin resistance cassette and, therefore, is a double mutant. However, this strain showed normal growth rate, normal levels of phycobiliproteins and chlorophylls and normal expression of psbA and nblA genes. Therefore, the phenotype observed by Li and Sherman (2000) in the ∆rppA mutant cannot be attributed to the lack of NrsR, but to the expression of NrsS in the absence of its natural substrate (NrsR). Thus, a cross-talk between NrsS and a response regulator involved in redox control may be responsible for the phenotype observed in the ∆rppA mutant.

The results shown here demonstrate conclusively that the NrsRS two-component system is controlling the nickel-dependent expression of the nrsBACD operon. How nickel sensing is carried out and how the signal is transduced is currently being investigated.

### Experimental procedures

#### Bacterial strains and growth conditions

Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 was grown photoautotrophically at 30°C in BG11 (Rippka et al., 1979) medium supplemented with 1 g per litre of HCO₃Na (BG11C) and bubbled with a continuous stream of 1% (v/v) CO₂ in air under continuous fluorescent illumination (50 μmol of photons per m² per second, white light). For plate cultures, BG11C liquid medium was supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) agar. Kanamycin was added to a final concentration of 50–200 μg ml⁻¹ when required. BG11C medium was supplemented with different concentrations of ZnSO₄, CdCl₂, CoCl₂, CuSO₄, NiSO₄ and MgCl₂ when indicated.

Escherichia coli DH5α (Bethesda Research Laboratories), grown in Luria-Bertani broth (LB broth) medium as described in Sambrook et al. (1989) was used for plasmid construction and replication. Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) grown in LB broth medium was used for expression of NrsR and NrsR∆N His-tagged proteins. Escherichia coli was supplemented with 100 μg ml⁻¹ ampicillin or 50 μg ml⁻¹ kanamycin when required.

Loci slr0797 and slr0798 were inactivated by replacing a 535 bp Hpal–EcoRI fragment by a kanamycin resistance cassette (C.K1) (Elhai and Wolk, 1988). For this, a genomic DNA fragment was polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified with oligonucleotides NIW1-NIW2 from the cosmid cs1377 (provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute) and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) to generate pNIQ6. The targeting vector was generated by inserting the C.K1 cassette into Hpal–EcoRI-digested pNIQ6, in the same orientation as the slr0797 gene (pNIQ9+) or in the inverse orientation (pNIQ9–). Synechocystis was transformed with these plasmids to generate the nrsRS::C.K1(+) and nrsRS::C.K1(–) mutant strains. Correct integration and complete segregation of the mutant strain was tested by Southern blotting. For this, total DNA from the cyanobacteria was isolated as described previously (Cai and Wolk, 1990). DNA was digested with Hincl and electrophoresed in 0.7% agarose gels in a Tris-borate-EDTA buffer system (Sambrook et al., 1989), then DNA was transferred to nylon Z-probe membranes (Bio-Rad). DNA probes were ³²P-labelled with a random-primer kit (Pharmacia) using [α-³²P]-dCTP (3000 Ci mmol⁻¹).

at 90°C in a water bath and cooled slowly to 50°C. For extension, a 10 μl mixture was prepared with half of the annealing mixture: 10 mM DTT, 0.5 mM each dNTP, 2 μg of Actinomycin D, 50 mM Tris HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 3 mM MgCl₂ and 100 U of Superscript™ II RNase H-Reverse Transcriptase (Gibco BRL). The mixture was incubated for 45 min at 45°C, and the reaction was stopped by adding 4 μl of formamide-loading buffer. Half of the reaction was electrophoresed on a 6% polyacrylamide sequencing gel together with a sequencing reaction of the *nrsRS* or *nrsBACD* promoter region, using the NIW3 or NIA1 oligonucleotide respectively.

### Cloning and purification of NrsR and NrsRΔN His-tagged proteins

The complete *nrsR* ORF was PCR-amplified with oligonucleotide TCP1 (which introduces a *Ndel* restriction site) and oligonucleotide TCP5 (which introduces a *BamHI* restriction site) (Table 1), digested with *Ndel-BamHI* and cloned into the *Ndel-BamHI*-digested pET28a (Novagen) to generate pTCP3. The NrsR protein expressed from this plasmid contains a six-histidine tag in the amino terminus. *nrsRΔN* was cloned by amplifying a 386 bp (from amino acid 118 to the end of the protein) using oligonucleotide TCP4 (which introduces a *Ndel* restriction site) and oligonucleotide TCP5 (which introduces a *BamHI* restriction site), digested with *Ndel-BamHI* and cloned into the *Ndel-BamHI*-digested pET28a (Novagen) generating pTCP2. The NrsRΔN protein expressed from this plasmid contains a six-histidine tag in the amino terminus. NrsR and NrsRΔN were expressed in *E. coli* BL21 from the plasmids pTCP3 and pTCP2 respectively. Then, 200 ml of culture was grown in L broth to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6, induced with 1 mM isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside for 2.5 h, harvested by centrifugation and resuspended in 8 ml of Tris-HCl pH 8.0 50 mM, KCl 50 mM, 10% glycerol, 0.1% Triton X-100, 5 mM imidazol (buffer A) supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. Cells were broken by sonication, and insoluble debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 18 000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was then applied to a Ni²⁺-charged, His-Bind, beads column (Novagen) (1 ml bead volume), washed with buffer A and eluted with the same buffer containing 200 mM imidazol. Imidazol was removed dialysing the samples against buffer A without imidazol. The purity of the samples was about 90%, as determined by scanning densitometry from the Coomassie blue-stained gel.

### Gel retardation assays

The probe was PCR-synthesized using oligonucleotides NIP1-NIP2 (Table 1), which introduce *StyI* and *Ncol* restriction sites, respectively, from cosmid cs1377 (provided by Kazusa DNA Research Institute), and the resulting DNA was digested with either of the enzymes and end-labelled with [α-³²P]-dCTP (3000 Ci mmol⁻¹) using Klenow fragment. The binding reaction was carried out in a final volume of 25 μl containing 4 ng of labelled DNA and 4 μg salmon sperm DNA in 20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 10 mM spermidine, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol and different amounts of partially purified NrsR and NrsRΔN. The mixtures were incubated

### Primer extension analysis of *nrsRS* and *nrsBACD* transcripts

Oligonucleotides NIW3 and NIA1, end-labelled with T4 polynucleotide kinase and [γ-³²P]-dATP (3000 Ci mmol⁻¹) following standard procedures (Sambrook et al., 1989), were used for primer extension analysis of *nrsRS* or *nrsBACD* promoters respectively. For annealing a 10 μl mixture containing 0.15 M HCl, 10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 20 μg of total RNA and about 2 pmoles of oligonucleotide (10⁶ cpm) were prepared. The annealing mixture was heated for 2 min

bated for 25 min at 4°C and loaded on a non-denaturing 6% polyacrylamide gel. Electrophoresis was carried out at 4°C and 280 V in 10 mM Na₂HPO₄ pH 6.0. Gels were transferred to a Whatman 3 MM paper, dried and autoradiographed.
