Triglycerides in adipose tissue are rapidly mobilized during times of energy needs via lipolysis, a catabolic process that plays important role in whole body triglyceride turnover. Lipolysis is regulated through cell surface receptors via neurotransmitters, hormones, and paracrine factors that activate various intracellular pathways. These pathways converge on the lipid droplet, the site of action of lipases and cofactors. Fat cell lipolysis is also involved in the pathogenesis of metabolic disorders, and recent human studies have underscored its role in disease states such as cancer cachexia and obesity-induced insulin resistance. We highlight here topics and findings with physiological and clinical relevance, namely lipid turnover in human fat cells and the role of lipolysis in cancer cachexia and obesity-induced insulin resistance.

Adipose tissue lipolysis, a key process in energy balance and pathological states

Adipose tissue is the major body repository of energy. It exerts a buffering activity for energy imbalance at the cellular and whole-organism levels, storing energy in the form of triglycerides during periods of excess energy intake, and releasing it in the form of non-esterified fatty acids (FAs) for other organs during fasting. The understanding of the cellular and molecular factors regulating these metabolic processes is in constant evolution. Recent discoveries have dramatically altered the view of adipose tissue lipolysis (see Glossary) and have highlighted the importance of additional molecular factors regulating this process. Elucidating their mode of action may lead to novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of metabolic disorders [1–3]. This review is devoted to recent advances in the understanding of the role of lipolysis in normal and pathological states in humans.

Short-term regulation of fat cell lipolysis

Over the years our understanding of the pathways involved in the short-term neural and hormonal control of lipolysis has dramatically increased (Figure 1). Sympathetic and sensory nerve fibers innervate white adipose tissue and modulate lipolysis, but the existence of parasympathetic innervation is a much-debated question [4]. Noradrenaline released from sympathetic nerves stimulates lipolysis through β-adrenoceptors, which are positively coupled to adenylyl cyclase through stimulatory G proteins (Gₛ proteins). This results in cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A (PKA). Another sympathetic nervous system neurotransmitter, neuropeptide Y, inhibits lipolysis through inhibitory G protein (Gᵢ protein)-coupled receptors. Regarding endocrine factors, adrenaline, natriuretic peptides, and insulin are major regulators of lipolysis in human adipose tissue [2]. The ratio between lipolytic β- and antilipolytic

Glossary

Adipose tissue lipolysis: the catabolic pathway in the fat cell that leads to the sequential breakdown of triglycerides, diglycerides, and monoglycerides into one molecule of glycerol and three molecules of fatty acids.  
Adipocyte triglyceride lipase (ATGL): an enzyme that catalyzes the first rate-limiting step in fat cell lipolysis, in other words the breakdown of triglycerides into diglycerides.  
Cell death-induced DNA fragmentation-factor-α-like effector A (CIDEA): a protein associated with the lipid droplet in human fat cells. Enhanced expression of CIDEA may contribute to decreased basal lipolysis.  
Comparative gene identification 58 (CGI58): a cofactor enhancing ATGL activity upon interaction with the enzyme. It also interacts with the lipid droplet binding protein, perilipin 1.  
Familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL): a common, inherited metabolic disorder characterized by high blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Patients with this condition are at increased risk of early cardiac failure.  
G0/G1 switch protein 2 (G0S2): a negative cofactor of ATGL and important regulator of lipolysis in adipocytes.  
Hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL): an enzyme expressed at high levels in adipose tissues and displaying a high affinity for diglycerides as substrates.  
Perilipin 1: the most abundant phosphorylated protein in the adipocyte. It is associated with lipid droplets and plays an essential role in the control of lipolysis. A decrease in perilipin 1 expression allows access of the lipases to the lipid droplet and leads to enhanced lipolysis.  
Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα): is produced by a wide variety of cell types, notably macrophages and adipocytes. It regulates several processes linked to immune response and inflammation as well as metabolic ones such as adipose tissue lipolysis.  
Zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG): is produced not only by some tumors but also by adipose tissue in conditions of cancer cachexia and calorie restriction. It modulates adipose tissue lipolysis.

**Figure 1. Overview of lipolysis regulation in human fat cells.** Signal transduction pathways for catecholamines via adrenergic receptors, autacoid- and metabolite-driven inhibitory receptors, and atrial natriuretic peptides via type A receptor (NPR-A). Protein kinases A and G (PKA and PKG) phosphorylate target protein such as hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) and perilipin 1 (PLIN). PLIN phosphorylation is a key event in the sequential activation of triglyceride (TG) hydrolysis involving adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), HSL, and monoglyceride lipase (MGL). Insulin, through activation of phosphodiesterase-3B (PDE-3B), inhibits catecholamine-induced lipolysis via the degradation of cAMP, whereas it is not active on cGMP-dependent pathways (natriuretic peptide pathway).

α2-adrenoceptors determines the net effect of adrenaline, which can stimulate or inhibit lipolysis. This ratio varies according to the location of the fat depots. For example, the predominance of α2-over β-adrenoceptors explains the marked resistance to adrenaline of femoral adipose tissue lipolysis [2,5].

Atrial and brain natriuretic peptides are potent activators of human fat cell lipolysis (Figure 1), acting through natriuretic peptide receptor A which possesses guanylyl cyclase activity [6]. The resulting production of cGMP activates protein kinase G (PKG). Physical exercise is a physiological condition with increased plasma atrial natriuretic peptide levels and stimulation of lipid mobilization. After a meal, the suppression of lipolysis is due to the rise in plasma insulin levels. The signal transduction pathway results in activation of phosphodiesterase 3B, which hydrolyzes cAMP into inactive 5′-AMP and thereby diminishes PKA-mediated phosphorylation. Recently, another mechanism involving lactate-mediated activation of an antilipolytic receptor was identified [7]. Fat cells produce lactate in significant amounts, especially when glucose uptake is stimulated. In an autocrine/paracrine loop, lactate activates the G<sub>i</sub> protein-coupled hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 1 (HCA1). Thereby, lactate counteracts the lipolytic effect of catecholamines mediated by β-adrenoceptors.

The physiological significance of several other antilipolytic receptors activated by paracrine factors revealed from in vitro studies remains to be elucidated. One of the G<sub>i</sub>

protein-coupled receptors, HCA2 (hepatocellular carcinoma-associated antigen 2, a nicotinic acid receptor; also known as MAGEC3, melanoma antigen C3), deserves special attention [8]. Its endogenous ligand is the ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate, whose plasma levels rise during fasting. Activation of this receptor could serve as a negative feedback loop to mitigate the rate of lipolysis during long-term fasting and starvation, and prevent a massive efflux of FAs into the bloodstream that may be detrimental. Nicotinic acid and other antilipolytic analogs, which have been used as drugs to correct dyslipidemia, activate HCA2. The major side effect of nicotinic acid therapeutic use is skin flushing due to HCA2-mediated activation of epidermal Langerhans cells. New-generation agonists devoid of flushing effect targeting HCA1 or HCA2 have been identified [9,10].

Intracellularly, the lipolytic pathways converge on either PKA or PKG, which phosphorylate several proteins interacting with the lipid droplet. The unilocular cytosolic lipid droplet of white adipocytes is composed of a core of triglycerides surrounded by a monolayer of phospholipids and lipid droplet-associated proteins, including structural proteins and enzyme coactivators [11]. At the lipid droplet surface, triglycerides are sequentially hydrolyzed into diacylglycerol, monoacylglycerol, and glycerol, releasing one molecule of FA at each step. Three enzymes work in a stepwise fashion to ensure complete hydrolysis of triglyceride: adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), hormone-sensitive lipase

(HSL), and monoglyceride lipase. Analyses of ATGL- and HSL-deficient mouse models have provided strong support for designating ATGL as the major triglyceride lipase in white adipose tissue and for assigning the primary function of HSL as a diglyceride lipase *in vivo*, although HSL possesses triglyceride lipase activity *in vitro* [3, 12, 13]. The pivotal role of ATGL in basal and stimulated lipolysis has also been demonstrated in human fat cells [14]. Full ATGL activation requires its binding with CGI58 (coactivator comparative gene identification 58; also named ABHD5) [15]. By contrast, G0S2 (G0/S2 switch gene 2) acts as a negative regulator of ATGL through inhibition of its triglyceride hydrolase activity [16]. Recent studies point to a role for phosphorylation of ATGL in the control of lipolysis [17, 18]. Ser404 (in human ATGL) appears as a site phosphorylated by PKA and AMPK (AMP-activated protein kinase). In both cases the phosphorylation has been associated with increased lipolysis. However, the importance of ATGL phosphorylation to the onset of lipolysis and the respective roles of the two kinases is still unclear. HSL regulation by reversible phosphorylation of serine residues induced by PKA and PKG and inhibited by AMPK is well established. HSL phosphorylation by protein kinases promotes translocation of the enzyme from the cytosolic compartment to the lipid droplet, and induces a conformational change that increases binding to lipid substrates. Re-evaluation of human HSL phosphorylation sites showed that Ser649 and Ser650 are the major determinants of protein kinase-mediated activation [19].

Perilipin 1, the most abundant structural protein associated with lipid droplets in adipocytes, is also a target for protein kinases. Upon lipolytic stimulation, structural reorganization of perilipin-coated lipid droplet is observed, allowing the lipases to hydrolyze their substrates [20]. Phosphorylation of perilipin seems to be necessary for dispersal of HSL, binding to lipid droplets, and maximal lipolytic stimulation. Concomitantly, protein PKA-mediated phosphorylation of perilipin leads to the release of CGI58, which can then interact with ATGL to promote its full activation. In this model, perilipin 1 appears as a protein that plays a crucial role in regulating lipolysis by coordinating the activation of lipases and their recruitment to the lipid droplet surface.

In summary, human fat cell lipolysis is under neural, hormonal, and paracrine regulation. Although the lipolytic and antilipolytic signaling pathways and the major rate-limiting steps are similar to those in most other mammals, important species differences exist. In humans, only two types of hormones, catecholamines and natriuretic peptides, have a pronounced lipolytic effect, whereas several potent antilipolytic mediators are operating. The control of triglyceride hydrolysis at the surface of the lipid droplet involves lipases and also cofactors some of which are probably not yet identified. The interactions between the different proteins are not fully understood.

### Turnover of triglycerides in human fat cells

Adipose tissue lipolysis is important for the turnover of lipids in the fat cells. Triglycerides are the major component of the adipocyte lipid droplet. The size of the lipid droplet is dependent on the balance between synthesis and breakdown of triglycerides. Owing to lack of simple methods only limited information on the turnover of human adipocyte triglycerides has been obtained in the past [21]. Recently, a method was developed to assess the age of these triglycerides by studying the incorporation of ${}^{14}$C from the atmosphere into the adipose lipids [22]. Using this method it was demonstrated that there is a high turnover of lipids in human fat cells. During the 10-year lifespan of a fat cell its lipid content is renewed over six times. Triglycerides appear mainly to constitute a metabolic active pool.

Adipose lipid turnover is markedly altered in human obesity due to a combination of increased assimilation and decreased removal of triglycerides [22]. Thus, adipocyte turnover of triglycerides might be important for the ability of fat cells to increase their lipid storage in obesity, and dysregulation of turnover underlines several pathologic conditions. For example, *in vitro* experiments have suggested [23] that an inherited pernicious dyslipidemia termed familial combined hyperlipidemia (FCHL) involves decreased adipocyte triglyceride turnover. Using the ${}^{14}$C methodology, adipose triglyceride turnover was found to be decreased also *in vivo* in FCHL, independently of body fat mass [22]. In this condition the capacity to assimilate triglycerides and remove triglycerides is impaired. It is therefore possible that decreased triglyceride turnover in adipose tissue is important for FCHL because it may result in decreased transport of FAs through adipose tissue and the FA shunt in the liver [22, 23]. Triglyceride turnover is also decreased in overweight subjects [24] and those with insulin resistance [22]. In the general population, increased plasma levels of triglycerides and apolipoprotein B are associated with low adipocyte triglyceride turnover [25]. Of the two major factors determining adipocyte triglyceride turnover—assimilation and removal of FAs—lipolysis is a key factor governing removal. It is important to note that the decreased removal rate observed in the mentioned turnover studies (obesity, overweight, dyslipidemia, FCHL) is paralleled by an inability of catecholamines to activate lipolysis fully [22, 24, 25].

It is not yet known what regulates the lipid turnover in human fat cells. However, the rate is inversely correlated with adipose tissue inflammation (i.e., secretion of inflammatory proteins) and the ability of catecholamines to stimulate lipolysis [22, 24, 25].

In summary, turnover of triglycerides in human fat cells (summarized in Figure 2) may be an important factor in the regulation of normal and abnormal lipid homeostasis. These lipids turn over at a relatively rapid rate in human fat cells, and their turnover is altered in disorders such as obesity and dyslipidemias. The decrease of turnover in these conditions occurs in parallel with decreased catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. Many obese individuals are insulin-resistant. It remains to be established how adipocyte triglyceride turnover may differ in ‘healthy’ (i.e., with normal insulin sensitivity) and metabolically ‘unhealthy’ obese people [26, 27].

**Figure 2. Overview of turnover of lipids in human fat cells.** Assimilation and removal of lipids from fat cells determine the triglyceride turnover in these cells. The turnover is decreased in subjects with excess body fat and dyslipidemia, and is regulated by lipolysis and the inflammatory state of adipose tissue. Lipolysis is a key factor in the removal of adipocyte lipids, and is thus an important regulator of triglyceride turnover in fat cells.

In summary, it is well established that lipolysis is accelerated in cancer cachexia. Recent studies have at least in part elucidated the mechanisms at the adipocyte level. ‘Superefficient’ lipolysis regulation seems to be at hand, with low rates at rest but increased rates after induction with stimulatory hormones. Distal regulators in the lipolytic cascade (CIDEA, HSL, ATGL) are probably of key importance. Whether the changes in lipolysis are related to factors produced by the tumor or by the host remains to be established.

**Obesity and insulin resistance**

Obesity is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clinical condition regarding pathophysiological aspects on lipolysis. However, there is to date no unifying picture. For catecholamines, earlier obesity studies show that their lipolytic effect is decreased in subcutaneous adipose tissue but increased in visceral adipose tissue [2,45,46]. Studies on natriuretic peptide-induced lipolysis are rare, but suggest a defect in subcutaneous adipose tissue of obese individuals [47]. There are noticeable sex differences, and catecholamine-induced lipolysis in visceral fat cells is higher in obese men than women [45,48]. In subcutaneous adipose tissue, several major defects have previously been described in obese and overweight individuals [2,45,46]. As far as spontaneous (basal) lipolysis is concerned, earlier data have firmly established that this rate is increased in subcutaneous fat cells of obese people, and previous studies also demonstrate an increased rate of lipolysis *in vivo* in the resting state of obese individuals examined after an overnight fast [2,45,49,50]. What causes basal lipolysis to be increased in obese human adipose tissue? One factor could be enlarged fat cell size in obese adipose tissue because the obesity effect on basal rate of lipolysis disappears when adjusted for fat cell size [2]. Since the early days of fat cell size determination more

levels and *in vivo* lipolytic activity in humans [38]. Interestingly, ZAG is an adipokine (i.e., protein secreted by adipose tissue) which is released at increased rates from human adipose tissue in cancer cachexia [38]. However, adipose ZAG is not a cancer cachexia-specific regulator of lipolysis. The secretion from human adipose tissue is also increased in healthy subjects after caloric restriction [39], suggesting that adipose ZAG is a general catabolic marker. Inflammatory factors have also been suggested as mediators of increased lipolysis in cancer cachexia [40]. There is, however, no evidence of local inflammation in adipose tissue of cancer cachexia patients [34]. The putative mechanism of increased ability of catecholamines and natriuretic peptides to enhance lipolysis in cancer cachexia is depicted in Figure 3. Low CIDEA expression and high HSL and ATGL expression in cancer cachexia fat cells make these cells prone to increased activation of lipolysis following hormonal stimulation. It is possible that tumor-and host-derived factors might regulate adipocyte lipolysis in cancer cachexia. Several pharmaceutical companies have developed selective inhibitors of HSL, which are very effective in inhibiting fat cell lipolysis [41–43]. ATGL inhibitors have also been identified [44]. Such inhibitors may be used for treatment of cancer cachexia, a condition for which no effective therapy is available for the moment.

disease, myocardial insufficiency, and cancer. In cancer cachexia, the loss of body weight is not solely explained by enhanced energy expenditure [28]. Cancer cachexia patients have an increased rate of lipid mobilization *in vivo*, and longitudinal studies show that cancer cachexia patients lose adipose tissue before they start losing muscle mass [29]. Novel human and animal studies have shed light on the putative mechanisms behind increased lipolysis in cancer cachexia. The ability of catecholamines (mice and human) and natriuretic peptides (human) to activate lipolysis is markedly increased [30,31]. This is attributed to increased expression of the rate-limiting lipases, HSL and ATGL [30,31]. However, increased expression of one of the major lipolytic receptor of catecholamines in human, namely the β1-adrenoceptor, may also play a role [32]. Interestingly, basal lipolysis is decreased in human fat cells in cancer cachexia patients, and this might be attributed to enhanced adipocyte level of endogenous CIDEA (cell death-inducing DFFA-like effector A) [33,34]. This protein is associated with the lipid droplet in human fat cells, and genetic ablation of adipocyte CIDEA increases basal lipolysis in white human fat cells [35–37]. It may seem contradictory to observe low basal but high stimulated levels of lipolysis in cancer cachexia. However, this phenotype might be considered as a ‘superefficient’ lipolysis regulation—with low lipid mobilization at rest, when energy liberation is less necessary, and high lipid mobilization in states of increased energy demands.

It is so far unclear which overriding factors cause the alterations of lipolysis. These could be circulatory factors derived from the tumor or the host. One possible factor is the zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG), which is produced by particular tumors. ZAG stimulates lipolysis in rodent fat cells [29], and recent human studies show that ZAG can enhance catecholamine-stimulated fat cell lipolysis [38]. Furthermore, there is a correlation between circulating ZAG

Figure 3. Overview of lipolysis in human fat cells in cancer cachexia. During lipolysis in cancer cachexia at least three regulatory factors are altered. The expression levels of the rate-limiting lipases, adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), are increased – leading to enhanced stimulatory effect of the lipolytic hormones catecholamines and natriuretic peptides. Increased expression of the lipid droplet coating protein, cell death-induced DNA fragmentation-factor-α-link effector A (CIDEA), leads to decreased spontaneous (basal) lipolysis. This combination of low resting and high stimulated rates makes lipolysis 'superefficient'. Overriding factors could be derived from the tumor or host, such as zinc-α2-glycoprotein (ZAG). Minus signs indicate inhibition and plus signs stimulation.

than 40 years ago it has been known that there is a positive correlation between basal lipolysis and fat cell size. Large fat cells, as observed in obesity, are associated with local inflammation [35,51]. One feature of this inflammation is enhanced local release of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), which originates from fat cells and nonfat cells within adipose tissue [52]. Although other cytokines/chemokines are also released within adipose tissue, only TNFα has a pronounced lipolytic effect in human adipocytes [49,50]. TNFα release from human adipose tissue is enhanced in obese individuals and is diminished following weight reduction [45,49,50]. The latter occurs in parallel with a decrease in basal lipolysis. However, not only increased production and secretion of TNFα but also alterations in the complex signal transduction pathways activated by the cytokine could be important for the increased basal lipolysis in obesity [35,53]. Many of these pathways converge at the level of perilipin 1 and cause increased phosphorylation and decreased expression of the protein. These changes at the level of perilipin 1 result in an increase of basal lipolysis [49,50]. The TNFα-mediated downregulation of G0S2, a negative regulator of ATGL, may also contribute to enhanced basal lipolysis [54]. Furthermore, the expression and activity of TNFα-linked IkB (inhibitor of nuclear factor kB) kinase (IKK) is altered in obese fat cells [55], which at least in part may explain increased TNFα-induced lipolysis. The anti-inflammatory glucocorticoids counteract TNFα-stimulated lipolysis in human adipocytes [56], further supporting the view that inflammation and subsequent TNFα activation are important for the control of basal lipolysis in obese individuals. Other factors related to inflammation could also play a role in enhanced basal lipolysis. Obese rodent adipocytes show significant endoplasmic reticulum stress which, in turn, activates several

TNFα signaling pathways in fat cells [57]. Another factor could be hypoxia. In adipose tissue of obese mice, the presence of hypoxia influences several cellular functions and metabolic pathways in adipocytes, including lipolysis regulation [58]. Whether or not hypoxia is present in obese human adipose tissue is unclear [59,60]. Recent studies show that although delivery of oxygen to the obese adipose tissue is reduced, the consumption of oxygen in this tissue and the metabolism of fat cells do not support the notion of a hypoxic state in obesity [60]. Thus, further studies in humans on hypoxia and endoplasmic stress are needed to address fully the role of these events in increased basal lipolysis in obesity.

Obese individuals are at increased risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. However, there is a wide disparity in insulin resistance among obese individuals [61]. Some obese persons may display a normal metabolic phenotype [26,27]. FAs derived from fat cell lipolysis have been postulated to play a crucial role in the development of insulin resistance [62]. Plasma non-esterified FA levels and fluxes are not simply determined by the amount of body fat and are partly controlled by adipose tissue lipolysis [63]. In human cohorts, basal lipolysis has proved to be a determinant of variations in insulin sensitivity across a wide spectrum of fat mass [64].

The effect that inhibition of fat mobilization from adipose tissue has on insulin sensitivity has been investigated in mouse models [12]. To address this relationship, mouse models with global total knockout of ATGL and HSL are not suitable. HSL is predominantly expressed in fat cells. HSL null mice show impaired development of fat depots when fed a high-fat diet and marked adipose tissue inflammation [65,66]. Metabolic defects are observed in multiple organs of ATGL global knockout mice, causing a complex

modulation of insulin sensitivity [13,67,68]. Moreover, adipocyte-specific ablation of ATGL markedly altered thermogenesis [17]. Studies at thermoneutrality are needed to appreciate the direct contribution to insulin sensitivity. Similarly, global knockout of ATGL cofactors may not prove informative. CGI58-deficient mice die early after birth due to a severe defect in the skin permeability barrier [69]. The lack of G0S2 has a major impact on the liver, and this masks the contribution of adipose tissue G0S2 to insulin sensitivity [70].

HSL haploinsufficient mice show diminished but not abolished HSL enzymatic activity and adipose tissue lipolysis [64]. In high-fat diet-fed mice, both HSL haploinsufficiency and treatment with a HSL inhibitor resulted in improvement of insulin tolerance without impact on body weight, fat mass, or adipose tissue inflammation [41,64]. In vivo palmitate turnover analysis revealed that blunted lipolytic capacity is associated with reduced FA uptake and storage in peripheral tissues. The reduction in FA turnover was accompanied by an improvement of glucose metabolism, with a shift in respiratory quotient, increased glucose uptake in white adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, and enhanced de novo lipogenesis and insulin signaling in liver. In human adipocytes, HSL gene silencing led to improved insulin-stimulated glucose uptake, resulting in increased de novo lipogenesis and activation of cognate gene expression. In clinical studies, adipose tissue basal lipolysis was negatively correlated with adipose tissue de novo lipogenesis gene expression. In obese individuals, chronic inhibition of lipolysis resulted in induction of de novo adipose tissue lipogenesis gene expression. Fat cell de novo lipogenesis has recently been suggested to constitute

a major determinant of whole-body insulin sensitivity [71,72]. Collectively, these data suggest that a partial reduction in adipose tissue lipolysis reshapes FA fluxes, without increase of fat mass, and improves glucose metabolism through cell-autonomous induction of fat cell de novo lipogenesis. They also raise the question of whether partial inhibition of adipose tissue lipolysis through HSL can be a strategy to improve insulin sensitivity [73]. Interestingly, a recent publication reports the potent antilipolytic effect of Atglistatin, a selective inhibitor of ATGL [44]. Therefore, the development of HSL and ATGL inhibitors for treating insulin resistance can be envisaged.

Based on older and more recent studies we propose the following model for the links between adipocyte lipolysis, human obesity, and insulin resistance (Figure 4). In subcutaneous adipose tissue, decreased lipolytic response to catecholamines could be a factor promoting and/or maintaining excess body fat in the overweight/obese state. Owing to increased fat cell size, the basal rate of lipolysis is accelerated, leading to increased delivery of FAs to skeletal muscle – which in turn causes insulin resistance. The enlarged fat cells augment the inflammatory activity of adipose tissue, causing increased local production and secretion of TNFα as well as multiple alterations in the signal transduction of this cytokine which, in turn, activates lipases and thereby stimulates basal lipolysis.

In summary, obesity and insulin resistance have a complex association with lipolysis. Decreased ability of catecholamines to activate lipolysis may promote and/or maintain excess body fat mass. Increased basal lipolysis occurring between meals and at rest may promote insulin resistance. What is cause and consequence remains to be

**Figure 4. Overview of the link between obesity, fat cell lipolysis, and insulin resistance in human. Decreased lipolytic response to catecholamines could favor the development and maintenance of obesity. An increased rate of basal lipolysis induces increased fluxes of fatty acids to skeletal muscle and the liver, which in turn cause insulin resistance. This increased basal lipolysis may be due to adipose tissue inflammation and increased production of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα). Whether endoplasmic reticulum stress and hypoxia contribute to increased basal lipolysis in humans is unclear for the moment.

### Concluding remarks and future perspectives

Recent studies have markedly advanced our understanding of the regulation of fat cell lipolysis and how this metabolic process is involved in metabolic diseases. Lipolysis is an important factor for the rapid turnover of lipids within the fat cells. This turnover is decreased in subjects with excess body fat and dyslipidemia when there is a concomitant decrease in catecholamine-stimulated lipolysis. The importance of ATGL and HSL in the stepwise hydrolysis of triglycerides has been shown both in murine and human fat cells, and also metabolic G<sub>i</sub> protein-coupled receptors, lipid droplet proteins, and lipase cofactors play a crucial role. Some issues remain to be clarified such as the physiological relevance of ATGL phosphorylation and the involvement of the natriuretic peptide pathway in the decreased stimulated lipolysis observed in obesity (Box 1). Basal lipolysis is elevated among obese individuals, probably due to increased production and secretion of TNFα within adipose tissue in combination with increased signal transduction of this cytokine. Enhanced lipolysis plays a major role in the loss of fat mass in cancer cachexia, according to recent human and mouse studies. Altered functions of CIDEA, HSL, and ATGL are key features for this increase in lipolysis. Accelerated spontaneous lipolysis may be an important factor for obesity-associated insulin resistance. Although FAs are potent inducers of insulin resistance, there is no straightforward relationship between the level of circulating FAs and insulin sensitivity. The basal, spontaneous, lipolytic activity rather than hormone-induced lipolysis seems to be crucial in insulin resistance. A pivotal role for HSL is plausible because inhibition of HSL improves insulin sensitivity. HSL and ATGL inhibitors have been developed but have not yet been tested in clinical trials. We propose that they could be useful in the treatment of cancer cachexia and obesity-induced insulin resistance.
