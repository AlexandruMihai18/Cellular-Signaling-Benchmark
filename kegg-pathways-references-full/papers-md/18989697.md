## Abstract  
The kidney plays a crucial role in the maintenance of the body calcium (Ca²⁺) balance. Ca²⁺ is an essential ion in all organisms and participates in a large variety of structural and functional processes. In mammals, active tubular Ca²⁺ reabsorption is restricted to the distal part of the nephron, i.e., the late distal convoluted (DCT2) and the connecting tubules (CNT), where approximately 10–15% of the total Ca²⁺ is reabsorbed. This active transcellular transport is hallmark by the transient receptor potential vanilloid 5 (TRPV5) epithelial Ca²⁺ channel, regulated by an array of events, and mediated by hormones, including 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, parathyroid hormone, and estrogen. Novel molecular mechanisms have been identified, such as the direct regulatory effects of klotho and tissue kallikrein on the abundance of TRPV5 at the apical membrane. The newly discovered mechanisms could provide potential pharmacological targets in the therapy of renal Ca²⁺ wasting. This review discusses the three basic molecular steps of active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the DCT/CNT segments of the nephron, including apical entry, cytoplasmic transport, and basolateral extrusion of Ca²⁺. In addition, an overview of the recently identified mechanisms governing this active Ca²⁺ transport through the DCT2/CNT epithelial cells will be presented.

## Introduction  
Calcium (Ca²⁺) is essential for the physiological functioning of all living cells. In humans, 99% of total body Ca²⁺ resides in the skeleton. The remaining 1% is distributed in soft tissues and extracellular fluid, which is the prime target of the Ca²⁺ homeostatic systems. Three tightly controlled mechanisms, including bone resorption and formation, intestinal absorption, and renal reabsorption, maintain Ca²⁺ homeostasis. In the kidney, approximately 45% of the plasma Ca²⁺, present in free ionized form, filters through the glomerulus and enters the proximal tubule segment of the nephron, where ~65% of the filtered Ca²⁺ is passively reabsorbed [56, 62]. In the thick ascending loop of Henle (TAL), an additional 20% is reabsorbed through this passive paracellular pathway, mediated by the tight junction protein claudin-16 [3, 43]. In these segments, Ca²⁺ reabsorption is not specifically regulated and depends on gradients established by NaCl and water reabsorption [61]. The final regulation of Ca²⁺ excretion, according to physiological needs, appears to occur primarily in two segments of the distal part of the nephron, namely in the late part of the distal convoluted tubule (known as DCT2) and the connecting tubule (CNT; Table 1) [16].

## Morphologic characteristics of the CNT  
The above discussed distal segments of the nephron exhibit distinct morphological, as well as functional features. In the superficial cortex, the DCT/CNT region is short and flows directly into the cortical collecting duct (CCD). Midcortical and juxtamedullary nephrons, on the other hand, have longer DCT/CNTs merging with other CNT segments into arcades before transitioning to the CCD [56]. DCTs consist of two short segments, DCT1 and DCT2, both comprising a

able for Ca²⁺, and transcellular Ca²⁺ transport occurs against an electrochemical gradient, supporting that Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the DCT2/CNT is mediated by active transepithelial transport.

### Transepithelial Ca²⁺ reabsorption

Transepithelial transport of Ca²⁺ is a three-step process. It initiates with influx of Ca²⁺ across the apical membrane mediated by TRPV5 [29]. Subsequently, entered Ca²⁺ is sequestered by the specialized intracellular carrier protein calbindin-D₂₈K and diffuses to the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1). Finally, transporter proteins, such as NCX1 and PMCA1b, extrude Ca²⁺ from the epithelial cell into the circulation (Fig. 1). The identification and characterization of TRPV5 as the gatekeeper of renal epithelial Ca²⁺ transport [30] gave new momentum to the understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the process of active Ca²⁺ reabsorption.

TRPV5—the apical gate

TRPV5, also known as the epithelial Ca²⁺ channel, is a member of the TRP channel superfamily [29]. This channel comprises large and flexible intracellular amino- and carboxyl-terminal tails flanking six transmembrane segments (TM) and an additional hydrophobic stretch between TM5 and TM6, predicted to be the pore-forming region. The amino-terminal tail contains six ankyrin repeats [19, 54] that are important structural elements for both channel assembly and protein–protein interactions [13, 19]. Furthermore, the first extracellular loop between TM1 and TM2 contains an evolutionary conserved asparagine (N₃₅₈) crucial for complex-glycosylation and in turn for regulating channel activity [11, 13, 33]. The carboxyl-terminal tail harbors three potential protein kinase C (PKC) sites, which suggests an important role for phosphorylation in channel activity. Moreover, in cultured mammalian cell systems, as well as in oocytes, TRPV5 is assembled into large homotetramers in order to acquire the active conformation

**Fig. 1 Model of transcellular Ca²⁺ reabsorption in DCT2 and CNT.** The renal distal tubule in the nephron comprises anatomically discrete segments, including the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle (TAL) and the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) that ends in the connecting tubule (CNT). The late part of the DCT (DCT2) and CNT play an important role in fine-tuning renal excretion of Ca²⁺. The epithelial Ca²⁺ channel (TRPV5) is primarily expressed apically in these segments and co-localizes with calbindin-D₂₈K (28K), Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCXI), and the plasma membrane ATPase (PMCA1b). Upon entry via TRPV5, Ca²⁺ is buffered by 28K and diffuses to the basolateral membrane, where it is released and extruded by a concerted action of NCX1 and PMCA1b. In addition, the basolateral membrane exposes a parathyroid hormone receptor (PTHr) and the Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase consisting of the α-, β- and γ-subunit. PTHr activation by PTH stimulates TRPV5 activity, and entered Ca²⁺ can subsequently control the expression level of the Ca²⁺ transporters. At the apical membrane, there is a bradykinin receptor (BK2) that is activated by urinary tissue kallikrein (TK) to activate TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ influx. In the cell, entered Ca²⁺ acts as a negative feedback on channel activity, and 28K plays a regulatory role by association with TRPV5 under low intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations. Extracellular urinary klotho directly stimulates TRPV5 at the apical membrane by modification of the N-glycan, whereas intracellular klotho enhances Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase surface expression that in turn activates NCX1-mediated Ca²⁺ efflux.
state [26, 33]. Facing each other, the hydrophobic stretches between TM5 and TM6 in each subunit are postulated to form the aqueous pore centered at the fourfold symmetry axis.

Detailed electrophysiological studies have compellingly demonstrated the constitutive activity of TRPV5 at low intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations and physiological membrane potentials [75]. The current-voltage relationship of TRPV5 shows strong inward rectification [29, 74, 75]. Another important functional feature of TRPV5 is the high Ca²⁺ selectivity, making this epithelial Ca²⁺ channel the most Ca²⁺-selective member in the TRP superfamily [75]. Finally, the generation of a TRPV5 deficient mouse strain (TRPV5⁻/⁻) provided compelling evidence for the physiological function of this channel. Active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in DCT2 and CNT is severely impaired in these animals as TRPV5⁻/⁻ mice waste approximately six- to tenfold more Ca²⁺ than their wild-type littermates, which is in line with the postulated gatekeeper function of TRPV5 in active Ca²⁺ reabsorption [31].

Shortly after the identification of TRPV5, a homologous channel, sharing 75% amino acid identity with TRPV5, was cloned from intestine and named TRPV6 [53]. Although there are some functional differences between these channels, TRPV6 exhibits the same Ca²⁺ selectivity and current-voltage relationship [32, 47, 78]. Moreover, this latter channel has been implicated in intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption. Disturbances in the Ca²⁺ homeostasis were also reported in mice lacking TRPV6 (TRPV6⁻/⁻) as these animals display reduced intestinal Ca²⁺ absorption and low bone mineral density [1]. Although it has been shown that TRPV6 is moderately expressed in adult kidney [59] and the TRPV6⁻/⁻ mice have increased urinary Ca²⁺ excretion, the exact role of TRPV6 in the kidney is not yet fully understood.

Calbindin-D₂₈ₖ—the intracellular shuttle

The principal cells of the DCT2/CNT segments are continuously challenged by a substantial Ca²⁺ influx through TRPV5, yet the cells manage to maintain a low intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]i). Maintaining the free [Ca²⁺]i at the basal level is essential for several reasons. High levels of free Ca²⁺ in the cytoplasm are known to induce apoptosis and protein precipitation. In addition, Ca²⁺ has an essential signaling function for many processes in the cell. More importantly, an increased [Ca²⁺]i has been shown to inhibit the activity of TRPV5 [75]. Based on the currently available data, three different models have been postulated for transepithelial Ca²⁺ transfer from the apical to the basolateral membrane. The first model is based on a passive diffusion tunneling through the endoplasmic reticulum, vesicular transport along the microtubules involving lysosomes, and finally, facilitated diffusion. According to the second model, Ca²⁺-transporting cells utilize lysosomes to sequester Ca²⁺ and facilitate its movement to the basolateral membrane [35]. The apical Ca²⁺ influx through TRPV5 initiates the disruption of the actin cytoskeleton and the formation of Ca²⁺-enriched endocytic vesicles, which are transported along the microtubules and some fuse with lysosomes [46]. In a third model, the intracellular diffusion of Ca²⁺ is facilitated by the vitamin D₃-dependent Ca²⁺-binding protein, calbindin-D₂₈ₖ, in the principal cells of DCT2 and CNT segments [7, 20]. Together with parvalbumin, calmodulin, and troponin C, calbindins are Ca²⁺-binding proteins that form a family of proteins with Ca²⁺ affinity [15]. Calbindin-D₂₈ₖ has three pairs of EF-hands that are the structural basis of the high Ca²⁺ affinity binding capacity [6]. Moreover, in the kidney, the expression of calbindin-D₂₈ₖ is restricted to DCT2, CNT, and CCD regions. It has also recently been shown that calbindin-D₂₈ₖ translocates to the TRPV5-containing plasma membranes upon a decrease in intracellular [Ca²⁺] and directly associates with this channel [39]. Due to the relatively slow Ca²⁺-binding kinetics of calbindin-D₂₈ₖ, hormone-induced Ca²⁺ signaling can also occur independently of the transcellular Ca²⁺ transport rate [37]. Bound to calbindin-D₂₈ₖ, Ca²⁺ is shuttled to the basolateral membrane, where Ca²⁺ is discharged into the blood flow by the basolateral Ca²⁺ extrusion systems. Finally, some studies reported that calbindin-D₂₈ₖ⁻/⁻ mice fed a high Ca²⁺ diet have impaired renal Ca²⁺ handling as they excrete more Ca²⁺ in their urine than the wild-type control littermates [60], whereas other studies did not observe a difference that is probably due to the compensatory increase of renal calbindin-D₉ₖ expression [22]. These data suggest that calbindin-D₂₈ₖ facilitates the intracellular diffusion of Ca²⁺ in DCT2 and CNT.

NCX1 and PMCA1b—the basolateral extrusion system

The energy-consuming step of transcellular Ca²⁺ transport lies in the Ca²⁺ efflux process. In this step, intracellular Ca²⁺ is transported across the basolateral membrane against its electrochemical gradient, and the ions are extruded back to the blood flow. Two transporters have been implicated in this mechanism, PMCA1b and NCX1. Plasma membrane ATPases are high-affinity Ca²⁺ efflux pumps that maintain the resting Ca²⁺ concentration in virtually all cells [4]. The highest Ca²⁺-ATPase activity in kidney was reported in the DCT segment. However, earlier studies have suggested that the capacity of this PMCA pump in CNT seems to be insufficient to keep pace with the absorptive flux of Ca²⁺ because it can transport only ~30% of the total Ca²⁺ efflux [2, 69]. In contrast to PMCA1b, the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger has been shown to be a prerequisite for transepithelial Ca²⁺transport [2, 69]. NCX1 exchanges Ca²⁺ and Na⁺ generally in a 1:3 stoichiometric ratio. Moreover, NCX1 is a widely expressed protein as it can be found in several tissues, including the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle [45]. In the kidney, the expression of NCX1 is restricted to the distal part of the nephron, particularly the CNT segment, where it predominantly localizes along the basolateral membrane [3, 28, 43] and accounts for the remaining 70% of the Ca²⁺ efflux [2, 69].

### Regulatory mechanisms of Ca²⁺ transport in DCT2/CNT

The aforementioned transporters comprise the machinery transporting Ca²⁺ from pro-urine to the blood in the DCT2/CNT. Several factors have been shown to contribute to the regulation of the Ca²⁺ transporting capacity of these particular nephron segments, which can be classified into four categories: (1) the control of the overall abundance of the transporter proteins by calciotropic hormones, (2) the rate of intracellular trafficking of the plasma membrane transporters, (3) alteration of activity of the transport proteins in the membrane by intracellular factors, and finally, (4) tuning apical Ca²⁺ influx by extracellular (luminal) factors.

#### Controlling the abundance of Ca²⁺ transporters

TRPV5 since a blockade of the apical Ca²⁺ influx by ruthenium red prevented the PTH-induced upregulation of the other Ca²⁺ transporters.

#### Vitamin D

The vitamin D endocrine system plays a pivotal role in Ca²⁺ homeostasis. In the recent years, it has become clear that the active form of vitamin D (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃, or abbreviated 1,25(OH)₂D₃) is a potent regulator of the Ca²⁺ transport proteins. Several groups have shown transcriptional regulation of TRPV5, calbindin-D₂₈K, and NCX1 by 1,25(OH)₂D₃, whereas a 1,25(OH)₂D₃-sensitivity for PMCA1b is not consistently reported. Studies in vitamin-D-deficient knockout models showed an impressive down-regulation of renal TRPV5, calbindin-D₂₈K, and NCX1 mRNA that could be normalized by 1,25(OH)₂D₃ supplementation, whereas PMCA1b was not significantly affected [27]. On the other hand, several studies indicated that PMCA1b is positively regulated by 1,25(OH)₂D₃ in the intestine to increase Ca²⁺ absorption. Northern blot analysis indicated that repletion of vitamin-D-deficient chickens with vitamin D increases PMCA mRNAs in the duodenum, jejunum, ileum, and colon [9]. Because these studies and the role of vitamin D in Ca²⁺ homeostasis have been reviewed extensively [29, 64, 70], detailed information is not included in this review.

#### PTH

Parathyroid hormone (PTH) is an essential component of the Ca²⁺ homeostasis. The secretion of PTH from the parathyroid gland is triggered by changes in blood Ca²⁺ levels sensed by the parathyroid Ca²⁺-sensing receptor [8]. PTH receptors have been detected in DCT2/CNT, enabling the direct control of active Ca²⁺ reabsorption by PTH [57]. PTH-mediated regulation of the Ca²⁺ transporters was studied in parathyroidectomized rats [68]. Parathyroidectomy reduced the expression of TRPV5, calbindin-D₂₈K, and NCX1. This decline in expression of Ca²⁺ transporters resulted in decreased active Ca²⁺ reabsorption and the development of hypocalcemia [68]. After PTH supplementation, the expression of Ca²⁺ transporters, as well as increased plasma Ca²⁺ concentration were normalized in these parathyroidectomized rats. In addition, the regulation by PTH was investigated in primary cultures of rabbit CNT cells. In these Ca²⁺-transporting cells, PTH resulted in an elevated expression of the Ca²⁺ transport proteins TRPV5, calbindin-D₂₈K, NCX1, and PMCA1b. Taken together, these results indicate that PTH stimulates renal Ca²⁺ handling by co-regulating the expression of the Ca²⁺ transport proteins [68]. In addition, experiments in these primary CNT cell cultures supported a gatekeeper role of

#### Estrogen

Although estrogen is generally not considered as a calciotropic hormone, it is widely accepted that it plays a role in renal Ca²⁺ handling. In rats, estradiol has been suggested to enhance the expression of TRPV5, NCX1, PMCA1b, and calbindin-D₂₈K [67]. In line with these observations, a recent study with aromatase deficient mice lacking the aromatase enzyme (aromatase⁻/⁻) and, therefore, estrogen deficient, also showed decreased expression of these transporters and concomitant renal Ca²⁺ wasting [52]. Additionally, estradiol treatment of these animals normalized the urinary Ca²⁺ excretion and gene expression. In agreement with these observations, increased renal Ca²⁺ wasting, as well as renal stone formation in women after menopause, is a well-known phenomenon [25], suggesting that estrogens may significantly contribute to the regulation of the transepithelial Ca²⁺ transport in the DCT2/CNT.

#### Controlling the intracellular trafficking

S100A10/annexin-2

S100A10 (also known as annexin-2 light chain) is an auxiliary protein for TRPV5 [72]. With two Ca²⁺-
insensitive EF-hands, S100A10 is predominantly present as a heterotetrameric complex with annexin-2, which has been implicated in many cellular processes, including endocytosis and exocytosis [21]. An important regulatory role has been proposed for the S100A10–annexin-2 heteromer in TRPV5 functioning [72]. The binding of annexin-2 to TRPV5 through S100A10 was shown to facilitate the translocation of TRPV5 toward the plasma membrane. This association of S100A10 and TRPV5 takes place through a short conserved peptide sequence, located in the carboxyl-terminus of TRPV5. Moreover, co-expression of S100A10, annexin-2, and TRPV5 has been observed in DCT2/CNT [72]. Taken together, these findings show that the S100A10–annexin-2 complex is a significant component for trafficking of TRPV5 toward the plasma membrane.

**Rab11a**

The small GTPase Rab11a has also been identified as a novel TRPV5-associated protein [71]. Rab11a is one of the key regulatory proteins that controls the recycling of endosomes [10, 76]. Rab11a was found to co-localize with TRPV5 in the DCT2/CNT. Here, both TRPV5 and Rab11a are present in subapical vesicular structures [71]. In addition, a direct protein–protein interaction was observed between Rab11a and TRPV5, suggesting that TRPV5 channels, present on the apical plasma membrane, recycle from the intracellular (recycling) endosomes in a Rab11-dependent manner.

**Clathrin and caveolin**

Van de Graaf and coworkers observed that the extraction of TRPV5 from the cell surface takes place in a constitutive clathrin-dependent manner [73]. In addition, the same authors showed that following its internalization, TRPV5 is not immediately targeted to protein degradation. Instead, by entering a Ca²⁺-dependent recycling pathway, TRPV5 remained stable in the subapical endosomal fraction [73]. Another recent study by Huang et al. suggested a caveolin-1-mediated internalization of TRPV5, which was inhibited by PKC [12]. Caveolin-1 is a structural component of caveolae and is crucial for the stabilization of the specialized membrane domains. Moreover, the caveolae-dependent internalization of TRPV5 was strongly inhibited by PTH-induced phosphorylation of TRPV5 via PKC, indicating that next to its genetic effect on expression, PTH also has a rapid effect on channel abundance [12]. These findings indicate that apical sorting of TRPV5 is likely to be mediated by several mechanisms that could be differentially controlled depending on physiological needs of the body.

Regulation of TRPV5 activity at the membrane

Intracellular Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, and PIP₂

Although the Ca²⁺ concentration in the luminal compartment of DCT2/CNT is in the 1.0–1.5 mM range, the resting [Ca²⁺]i in these cells is maintained around 100 nM by NCX1 and PMCA1b. TRPV5 has a high Ca²⁺ selectivity, and at physiological Ca²⁺ concentrations, its current is mainly carried by Ca²⁺. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells heterogeneously expressing TRPV5, currents can be activated under conditions of high intracellular Ca²⁺ buffering by hyperpolarizing voltage steps. Earlier, Nilius et al. suggested that intracellular Ca²⁺ acts as a negative feedback switch regulating TRPV5 activity. The Ca²⁺ current through TRPV5 is inhibited by the [Ca²⁺]i with an IC₅₀ of 82 nM [50]. Considering this high affinity of Ca²⁺-dependent channel inhibition, the presence of the co-expressed Ca²⁺ buffer calbindin in DCT2/CNT plays an important role to maintain TRPV5 activity. Conclusively, the [Ca²⁺]i itself directly regulates channel function in order to maintain optimal Ca²⁺ reabsorption without excessive influx of Ca²⁺.

Single TRPV5 channel currents in cell-attached and inside-out patches were only detected in the absence of Ca²⁺ and had a conductance of ~75 pS [51]. So far, no reliable single channel measurements have been performed in the presence of extracellular Ca²⁺. Another interesting feature of TRPV5 is the open pore blockage by intracellular Mg²⁺. Currents through TRPV5 are small at physiological extracellular Mg²⁺ and Ca²⁺ concentrations, but sufficient to increase the [Ca²⁺]i at hyperpolarized potentials. Therefore, block by Mg²⁺ and decrease of the current by extracellular Ca²⁺ might be physiologically important to prevent Ca²⁺ overload of TRPV5-expressing cells [51, 75]. In addition, Huang and colleagues reported that PIP₂ activates TRPV5 and that activation of the channel by PIP₂ reduces the sensitivity of TRPV5 to the inhibition by the intracellular [Mg²⁺] [17, 42]. In this model, hydrolysis of PIP₂ by receptor activation of PLC may increase the sensitivity for Mg²⁺ inhibition.

**80K-H**

Another protein called 80K-H has been shown to directly interact with TRPV5 in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner [23]. The 80K-H protein contains two putative EF-hands and an ER-targeting signal. This TRPV5-linked protein was originally cloned as a PKC substrate and was subsequently associated with intracellular signaling [58]. Binding with Ca²⁺ abolished the inactivation of the two EF-hand motifs of 80K-H, and this, in turn, reduced the TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ current and increased the sensitivity of TRPV5 to the [Ca²⁺]i, accelerating the feedback inhibition of the channel [23].

Moreover, 80K-H also co-localizes with TRPV5 in the DCT2/CNT. Based on these findings, 80K-H has been hypothesized to act as a Ca²⁺ sensor to regulate the activity of TRPV5 at the plasma membrane [23].

Pro-urinary factors stabilize TRPV5 in the apical membrane

Tissue kallikrein

Tissue kallikrein (TK) is a multifunctional serine protease that is primarily synthesized in the DCT2 and CNT and catalyzes the kininogen kinin conversion [55]. TK is secreted into the pro-urine, where it mediates the formation of bradykinin that binds to the type 2 bradykinin receptor (B2R) [18]. A striking effect of TK has been observed in primary rabbit CNT cells mediating transcellular Ca²⁺ transport [24]. Apical addition of TK or bradykinin (BK) significantly increased transcellular Ca²⁺ transport that was prevented by B2R antagonists, whereas basolateral application of either TK or BK had no effect [24]. This stimulatory effect of TK was mediated by the apical B2R signaling through the phospholipase C/diacylglycerol/PKC pathway, resulting in phosphorylation of TRPV5 and subsequent delay in its retrieval from the plasma membrane. Additionally, mice lacking TK (TK⁻/⁻) waste a large amount of Ca²⁺ without any significant alterations in plasma Ca²⁺, PTH, and vitamin D₃ levels or any detectable changes in the expression of Ca²⁺ transporters in the DCT2/CNT. These observations together highlight the importance of the regulation of the TRPV5 channel abundance in the membrane by the pro-urine TK.

Urinary pH and Mg²⁺

The acid-base balance has long been known to affect Ca²⁺ homeostasis. For example, patients with chronic metabolic acidosis waste Ca²⁺. Pioneering micropuncture studies have shown that chronic metabolic acidosis results in Ca²⁺ wasting [63]. Recent advances in total reflection fluorescent microscopy analysis allowed the identification of the molecular basis underlying these in vivo observations. Exposure of TRPV5-expressing cells to an alkaline extracellular environment (pH 8.0) caused rapid recruitment of TRPV5-containing vesicles to the cell surface and a consequent increase in TRPV5 activity [40]. In the reciprocal experiment, acidic extracellular milieu (pH 6.5) induced the internalization of TRPV5-containing vesicles from the plasma membrane, resulting in a reduced channel activity [40]. The extracellular acidity clearly affected the current kinetics resulting in diminished single channel conductance as shown by Yeh et al. [77]. Binding of protons to an extracellular glutamate near the pore helix of TRPV5 at position 522 (E₅₂₂) resulted in decreased channel activity,

whereas substitution with a glutamine (E₅₂₂→Q₅₂₂) abolished the proton sensitivity. This recognized E₅₂₂ as the extracellular pH sensor in TRPV5. Based on these experiments, binding of protons to the sensor has been proposed to induce a conformational change of the TRPV5 pore helix, leading to a lowered channel activity. These observations clearly point out that urinary acidification results in decreased channel activity at the apical cell membrane, as well as in a rapid retrieval of TRPV5 from the apical membrane, both of which are likely to account for the renal Ca²⁺ wasting in metabolic acidosis. Also, urinary Mg²⁺ is known to modulate urinary Ca²⁺ excretion, but the mechanism underlying this relationship is unknown. In a recent study by Bonny et al., it was elegantly demonstrated that an alteration in urinary Ca²⁺ excretion is directly proportional to the change in Mg²⁺ excretion and inversely proportional to the adjustment in urine pH [5]. Because TRPV5 was inhibited by Mg²⁺, these data are compatible with the hypothesis that urinary Mg²⁺ directly inhibits Ca²⁺ reabsorption in DCT2/CNT, which can be overruled by an alkaline luminal pH.

Klotho

Klotho is a type-I (single-pass) membrane protein predominantly expressed in tissues involved in Ca²⁺ homeostasis, such as kidney, choroid plexus, and the parathyroid gland [34]. The ablation of klotho causes severe multiple phenotypes in klotho-deficient (klotho⁻/⁻) mice, such as short life span associated with infertility and sternly impaired Ca²⁺ and phosphate metabolism [38, 65]. There is a growing body of evidence that klotho controls active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the DCT2/CNT segments through several mechanisms.

In kidney, klotho is exclusively expressed in DCT2/CNT, where following extracellular domain shedding, it is secreted into the circulation and the pro-urine [13]. The secreted form of klotho exerts β-glucuronidase activity [14]. More importantly, klotho was suggested to regulate the apical entry of Ca²⁺ in the DCT2/CNT region. The presence of extracellular klotho robustly increased the activity of TRPV5 in cultured rabbit primary CNT cells. Moreover, TRPV5-expressing HEK293 cells also showed a significant rise in channel activity after klotho treatment that was accompanied with concomitant increased plasma membrane channel abundance [14]. In addition, removal of the complete N-glycan tree by Endo-F was recently reported to result in a more pronounced increase in TRPV5 activity compared to that of observed upon klotho treatment [44]. Recently, Cha et al. suggested sialidase rather than β-glucuronidase activity for klotho, as they observed a klotho-mediated removal of terminal sialic acids from the N-glycan in TRPV5 [11]. This cleavage exposed the
underlying galactose-N-acetylglucosamine disaccharides in TRPV5, which can directly interact with membrane-bound galectin-1, causing the subsequent plasma membrane retention of TRPV5. Interestingly, treatment with PNGaseF to hydrolyze the entire N-glycan of TRPV5 mimicked the stimulatory effect of klotho, suggesting additional mechanisms besides binding to membrane galectin-1. It should be noted that Cha et al. also reported a comparable increase in TRPV5 activity upon β-glucuronidase treatment; however, this effect could be observed only at much higher (0.1–1 μM) concentrations of the enzyme, suggesting that klotho exhibits primarily sialidase activity at physiologic concentrations (~20–200 pM) [11]. These observations confirmed the original conclusion that extracellular klotho hydrolyses oligosaccharide chains from the N-glycosylated TRPV5, causing channel retention at the membrane and a subsequent increase in TRPV5-mediated Ca²⁺ influx [14]. In line with these findings, microperfusion studies have shown that CNTs from klotho⁻/⁻ mice fail to respond to PTH and, therefore, waste large amounts of Ca²⁺ [66]. Interestingly, klotho was reported to interact and increase Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase activity at the plasma membrane and stimulating the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchange through NCX1 [34]. Taken altogether, there is compelling evidence that klotho is a novel calciotropic factor that, amongst others, can exert its stimulatory effect on TRPV5 cell surface retention from the pro-urine in the DCT2 and the CNT.

### Clinical relevance

Several clinical disorders, such as chronic renal failure or diabetes, are associated with the symptoms of dysregulating body Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Chronic renal failure (CRF) is frequently characterized by hypocalcemia, osteoporosis, growth retardation, and secondary hyperparathyroidism. Remarkably, the phenotype of the klotho⁻/⁻ mice resembles most of these characteristics [36]. Moreover, CRF patients also have greatly reduced renal klotho levels [36]. Together with the fact that klotho can regulate the activity of TRPV5 and NCX1 via Na⁺/K⁺-ATPase, the involvement of klotho in the pathogenesis of Ca²⁺ abnormalities in CRF may be envisaged.

Hypercalciuria and nephrolithiasis, disorders with a high prevalence and socio-economic burden in the Western society, are often treated with thiazide diuretics. These drugs are known to affect the Ca²⁺ balance by inducing hypocalciuria. Over the last decade, it was speculated that thiazide-inhibited NCC activity stimulates active Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the DCT/CNT. However, recent studies indicated that paracellular Ca²⁺ transport in the proximal tubule due to extracellular volume contraction explains the hypocalciuria during chronic thiazide treatment [48, 49].

---

Hypercalciuria is also an early finding in diabetes mellitus patients. Similarly, rats with experimentally induced diabetes display a significant increase in the fractional excretion of Ca²⁺ [41]. However, these diabetic rats showed increased mRNA and protein levels of both TRPV5 and calbindin-D₂₈ₖ. Additionally, insulin therapy corrected the hyperglycemia-associated hypercalciuria and abolished the upregulation of TRPV5, suggesting that the increased TRPV5 abundance in diabetic rats is due to a compensatory adaptation to an increased load of Ca²⁺ secondary to hyperglycemia. Although in many pathophysiological conditions the expression level of the Ca²⁺ transporters is out of balance, mutations in these proteins have not been discovered yet.

#### Concluding remarks and future perspectives

Ca²⁺ reabsorption in the kidney and particularly in the distal DCT2/CNT segments of the nephron is critical in the maintenance of the Ca²⁺ balance. Here, TRPV5 is the gatekeeper of the Ca²⁺ entry, and therefore, a tight control of its activity enables the organism to adjust Ca²⁺ reabsorption according to any demands of the body. The available experimental data summarized in this review highlights the most important mechanisms that can actually regulate active Ca²⁺ reabsorption. Of these, controlling the TRPV5 cell surface expression by extracellular factors in the pro-urine is a newly discovered mechanism. Klotho delays the retrieval of TRPV5 from the cell membrane by modifying the N-glycan composition, whereas the insertion of channels in the cell membrane is promoted by TK-induced phosphorylation or alkaline pH. All mechanisms result in increased TRPV5 abundance and, in turn, regulate the entry of Ca²⁺ at the gate. However, the canvas is far from complete. The molecular mechanism by which intracellular Ca²⁺ bound to calbindin-D₂₈ₖ is transported to the basolateral extrusion transporters NCX1 and PMCA1b is largely unknown. It could be envisaged that the local Na⁺ concentration may promote the release of Ca²⁺; however, no experimental data are available to support this theory. Therefore, the Ca²⁺ transfer between calbindin-D₂₈ₖ on one site and NCX1 and PMCA1b on the other site needs special attention. Another interesting question to be solved is the regulation of the basolateral trafficking of NCX1 and PMCA1b in the DCT2 and CNT cells. Certain players, such as the scaffold 14-3-3, phospholemman, ankyrin, or caveolin-3, have been proposed to play a role in the trafficking of the NCX transporters in neurons and cardiac cells. Nevertheless, the basolateral sorting of these transporters in the DCT2/CNT is essentially unknown. Whether there is a crosstalk between the apical Ca²⁺ entry and the basolateral Ca²⁺ extrusion regulatory apparatus is not known. The fact that klotho increases both
the channel abundance of TRPV5 in the apical membrane and the activity of NCX1 at the basolateral side certainly predicts the existence of such crosstalk [14, 34]. The main question for the coming years is how all of these Ca²⁺ transport proteins communicate with each other in order to facilitate optimal and regulated transcellular Ca²⁺ reabsorption in DCT2 and CNT under conditions of disturbed Ca²⁺ homeostasis.
