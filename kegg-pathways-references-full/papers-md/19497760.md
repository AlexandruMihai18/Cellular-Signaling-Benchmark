ABSTRACT

As a component of all living cells and microbes, it is not surprising that organisms have evolved mechanisms to detect foreign or aberrant DNA and trigger an innate immune response. TLR9 is an endosomal membrane bound receptor that is widely studied and the best understood DNA sensor. However, the existence of TLR9-independent DNA sensing pathways have been recognized for many years. Recently, novel cytosolic DNA sensors have been uncovered that include ZBP1 or DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors (DAI) and a DNA sensing inflammasome consisting of the HIN200 protein, absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2). In combination with TLR9, these receptors provide a diverse repertoire of mechanisms to alert the cell to microbial DNA and possibly aberrant host DNA leading to the activation of the innate immune system.

1. Introduction

The innate immune system is an integral part of the host response to invading pathogens and other danger signals. It offers the first line of defense against viral and bacterial organisms through the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) by a range of germline encoded pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). Activation of the innate immune system leads to diverse cellular responses including the induction of interferon regulatory factors (IRF) 3, 7 and NFκB that regulates type I interferon and pro-inflammatory cytokine gene expression respectively [1]. The host recognition of nucleic acids is an essential component of the innate immune system. It was first suggested in the 1960s that nucleic acids were a stimulus for interferon production in cells [2]. In 1963, Rotem et al. found that non-viral foreign murine nucleic acids, including DNA could induce an antiviral interferon response in chick embryo fibroblasts and mouse cells [3], an effect that was also observed using yeast nucleic acids [4]. Surprisingly, these intriguing studies were not actively pursued until the end of the century, when it was observed that pathogenic and self-DNA upregulated the expression of host immune response genes in various different cell types [5–7]. Coinciding with the discovery of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and other PRRs, the understanding of nucleic acid recognition by the host has since increased exponentially. The sensing of microbial DNA and RNA is distinct and mediated by different innate pathways and effector molecules. Foreign DNA and RNA can arise directly from the genomes of invading pathogens or from the transcription/replication of viral and bacterial (pathogenic) genes. Non-microbial (endogenous) DNA can also have a significant impact on the innate immune system shedding new light on several clinical syndromes such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) that are typified by autoimmunity to self-DNA. Recent studies have advanced the understanding of DNA sensing and the host immune response. The discovery of ZBP1 (DLM-1 or DAI, DNA-dependent activator of interferon-regulatory factors), the AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) inflammasome and the characterization of nucleases such as TREX1 in the innate immune response to DNA, in combination with the increased understanding of TLR9 biology, provides clarity to a phenomenon first discovered over 40 years ago [8–13].

2. TLR9: a membrane bound endosomal DNA sensor

The most extensively studied group of PRRs is the TLRs. These receptors activate signaling events that result in the transcription and regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and type I interferons. Since the discovery of the first human TLR [14], signaling pathways downstream of these receptors have been well delineated. TLRs contain leucine rich repeat (LRR) motifs, a Toll/IL-1R homology domain and are considered type I integral membrane glycoproteins. Once stimulated, the TLRs dimerize, change in conformation and recruit TIR domain containing adaptor molecules (MyD88, TIRAP/MAL, TRIF/TICAM1 and TRAM) that initiate signal transduction [15].

TLR9 is the membrane bound receptor for DNA in the cell (Fig. 1). Hemmi et al. first proposed the function of human TLR9 by showing that it responded to bacterial unmethylated CpG DNA but not self-DNA, resulting in MyD88-dependent NF-κB activation [16]. Studies also suggested the endosomal location of TLR9 with its lig-

Fig. 1. Overview TLR9 interactions and signaling. TLR9 is localized in the ER and translocates to DNA-containing endosomes to initiate signaling. Translocation requires ER proteins UNC93B1, gp96 and PRAT4A. Following endosomal acidification and ligand interaction, TLR9 is activated and binds MyD88, IRAK4 and IRAK1 that are essential to activate NFκB and induce the expression of type I interferons via IRF7.

and binding sites within the vesicular space and away from the cytoplasm [16,17]. In humans, TLR9 is found primarily in plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), specialized cell types that are capable of producing large amounts of type I interferons during viral infection [18]. The importance of TLR9 in host antiviral defense is confirmed by several studies that demonstrate a requirement for TLR9 in the response to DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus and murine cytomegalovirus [19–21]. Ligands specific for TLR9 induce the production of interferon-α in pDCs cells in a MyD88-dependent manner that differs from signaling downstream of most other TLRs. Upon TLR9 stimulation within the endosome, MyD88 generates a molecular complex with IRAK-1, IRAK-4 and the interferon regulatory factor, IRF-7 [22,23]. IRF-7 is phosphorylated by IRAK-1 which then translocates to the nucleus to mediate the transcription of interferon-α genes [24]. In this regard, and unlike signaling to NFκB, IRAK-1 appears to be an essential component in the MyD88 pathway that results in IRF-7 activation. IRAK-1 deficient mice are incapable of activating IRF-7 although NFκB activation, which is dependent primarily on IRAK-4 remains intact [23,24]. The activation of NFκB downstream of TLR9 is also dependant on TRAF6 E3 ubiquitin ligase activity [22].

TLR9 activation by DNA requires endosomal acidification and maturation consistent with the observation that the receptor is not constitutively active in resting cells [17,25]. TLR9 resides in the endoplasmic reticulum, but not the Golgi of unstimulated pDCs. The internalization of CpG DNA induces the translocation of TLR9 to endolysosomes and subsequent activation [26,27]. The endoplasmic reticulum UNC93B1 membrane spanning protein is recognized as a key player in TLR9 trafficking, through its ability to bind strongly to the transmembrane regions of the nucleotide sensing TLRs [28–30]. Mice that carry an H412R mutation in the UNC93B1 gene (3d mice) are unable to interact with nucleotide sensing TLRs and display impaired TLR3, TLR7 and TLR9 signaling. The biology is significant since 3d mice and patients with mutations in UNC93B1 have defects in the response to DNA viruses such as herpes simplex virus and murine cytomegalovirus [29,31]. The chaperone protein gp96 and PRAT4A (protein associated with TLR4) also interact with TLR9 (and TLR7) and are necessary for proper protein folding and trafficking from the ER to endolysosomes [32,33]. However, the exact mechanism by which these proteins mediate the effects needed for proper TLR9 signaling remain unknown. Once in the endosome, binding between the ligand and receptor occurs

and MyD88 is rapidly recruited to these areas to initiate the signaling pathway. Endosomal acidification and maturation is required to cleave the ectodomain of the TLR9 receptor to the functional receptor. Once cleaved, the truncated form of TLR9 is able to recruit MyD88 and initiate signaling [34,35]. The complex regulation of TLR9 signaling illustrates an elegant mechanism to separate the recognition of microbial and self-nucleic acids and protect the host from an inappropriate immune response.

Despite the many levels of regulation, under the proper circumstances, TLR9 is also capable of recognizing self-DNA and is associated with autoimmunity [36,37]. The specialized localization of TLR9 prevents it from encountering self-DNA in the cytosol or present in the extracellular space. Unlike viruses and bacteria that have evolved specialized mechanisms to gain entry into cells, self-DNA has a limited ability to be internalized into endosomal compartments [25,38]. The importance of this compartmentalization in preventing recognition of self-DNA is illustrated by several studies. LL37 is an antimicrobial peptide produced in the skin of patients with psoriasis [39,40]. LL37 complexed with human DNA is retained in early endosomes and facilitates the activation of TLR9 in dendritic cells. Similarly, TLR9 activation is increased by DNA-cationic lipid (DOTAP) complexes or immunoglobulin-chromatin immune complexes that also enhance internalization and DNA-targeting to endosomes [25,37,38]. TLR9 targeting to the endosome is regulated by its transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains [41,42]. Using a TLR9/TLR4 chimeric protein, Barton et al. showed that TLR9 expressed on the cell surface could be activated by mammalian and vertebral DNA [41]. Together, these studies strongly suggest that it is the localization of TLR9, and not the sequence specificity of the DNA that determine receptor activation. Wagner and co-workers, in a series of studies, have provided compelling evidence that support this view [38,43,44]. Using a panel of oligonucleotides, the determinants of TLR9 activation were shown to depend primarily on targeting and retention of DNA to early and late endosomes. Oligonucleotides complexed with cationic lipids (DOTAP) or containing 3′-polyguanosine tails (to increase endosomal translocation and nuclease resistance) activated dendritic cells in a CpG-independent manner. Studies by this group identified the phosphodiester 2′ deoxyribose backbone of single-stranded DNA, and not sequence as the primary determinant of TLR9 activation. However, CpG-containing DNA still displayed a higher binding affinity for TLR9 than non-CpG contain-

ing sequences lending some capacity to differentiate self-DNA and microbial DNA at a molecular level [38,43].

# 3. Cytosolic DNA sensors

The introduction of TLR9 antagonists and TLR9 deficient mice helped uncover the presence of a TLR9-independent cytosolic DNA sensor (s) [44–53]. For example, several studies showed that the response to DNA vaccination remained intact in TLR9 deficient mice [49,50]. Consistent with this, Cortez-Gonzalez et al. found that bacterial plasmid DNA could be taken up and activate B lymphocytes in a TLR9-independent manner [54]. The existence of a TLR-independent type I interferon pathway was also suggested following *L. monocytogenes* infection that triggered a potent IRF-3/interferon-β-dependent immune response in macrophages lacking TRIF, MyD88, TRAM and TLR9 [55]. More recently, several groups have characterized the TLR-independent response to DNA, also referred to as the interferon-stimulatory DNA (ISD) pathway [6,44,45,47,56]. Unlike TLR9 activation that occurs in endosomes and influenced by DNA sequence and methylation, the TLR-independent response to DNA is believed to be cytosolic and triggered by double-stranded DNA in a size but not sequence-restricted manner [6,7,44]. Furthermore, the sensing of DNA is clearly distinct from the TLR system in that it does not require TRIF or MyD88 and it is separate from the cytosolic RNA-sensing RIG-like receptors (RLRs) that signal via the adaptor IPS-1 (also known as Cardif/VISA/MAVS) [6,44,45,47,56]. Several new molecules have now been described that play a role in the TLR-independent sensing of DNA.

## 3.1. ZBP1

In 2007, Takaoka et al. described a receptor capable of sensing cytosolic DNA and regulating the type I interferon response [8]. Renaming the molecule DAI, it was previously known under two names: DLM-1 and Z-DNA binding protein-1 (ZBP1) (Fig. 2) [57,58]. ZBP1 was originally found to be up-regulated in tumor stromal cells [58] but was later shown to be highly expressed in numerous tissues, lymphocytes and macrophages [57,59,60]. ZBP1 binds uncommon left handed Z-form DNA with high affinity and it shares similar DNA-binding domains (Zα and Zβ) to the RNA editing enzyme adenosine deaminase acting on RNase1 (ADAR1) and the vaccinia virus protein E3L (Zα). The presence of multiple C-terminal serine/threonine phosphorylation sites and the observation that ZBP1 is interferon inducible hinted at a role in signal transduction and in the immune response to pathogens [8,58]. Indeed, the overexpression of ZBP1 mediates an IRF-3-dependent type I interferon response to transfected B-DNA and forms a complex with TBK1 and IRF3 through its C-terminal domain [8]. ZBP1 also interacts with RIP1 and RIP3 via a RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif) domain that results in NFκB activation [61]. ZBP1-targeting siRNA reduced the B-DNA and alpha-herpesvirus (HSV-1) activation of IRF-3 and the expression of type I interferons suggesting that this molecule played a role in the TLR-independent DNA sensing mechanism. While the interaction between ZBP1 and certain forms of DNA was known previously, it was not studied extensively. Using deletion mutant vectors, Takaoka et al. identified a new region (D3) that participated in DNA binding in addition to the two previously discovered Z-DNA binding domains (Zα and Zβ). Consistent with the previous observations regarding the TLR-independent recognition of dsDNA, DNA binding to ZBP1 occurred irrespective of its sequence but the activation of interferon responses was DNA-length restricted with little activation in response to DNA less than 100 bp. From the length studies it was suggested that DNA was needed to maintain a ZBP1 multimeric complex required for activation of type I interferon genes [62,63].

While ZBP1 was the first cytosolic DNA sensor identified, Wang et al. found evidence that other redundant DNA sensing pathways existed, though evidence suggested this response to be dependent on cell type [62]. In vivo, Ishii et al. showed that ZBP1 and MyD88/TRIF pathways were dispensable for the innate response to B-DNA since the induction of type I interferons and the response to DNA vaccination was intact in mice genetically deficient in these molecules. The innate response to DNA and DNA vaccination relied on TBK-1 which is downstream of both ZBP1 and MyD88/TRIF (i.e. TLR9) pathways. However since a double knockout approach was not utilized the possibility remains that ZBP1 and TLR9 are redundant to each other and thus, the biological significance of ZBP1 remains to be determined [64].

## 3.2. AIM2 and the inflammasome

The nucleotide-binding domain leucine rich repeat (NLR) family of proteins represent a group of intracellular PRRs that mediate NFκB signaling and caspase 1 activation. These cytosolic receptors contain a NOD domain, LRRs, and a signaling domain (CARD, PYD, or BIR). They have been connected to the recognition of microbial components such as iE-DAP (NOD1, NLRC1) and muramyl dipeptide (NOD2, NLRC2). In the case of these two receptors, stimulation by their respective ligands causes them to oligomerize and recruit a serine/threonine kinase (RIP2/RICK) to their CARD domains, resulting in activation of NF-κB [65]. The majority of NLRs however play a role in the formation of proteolytic complexes termed inflammasomes [66,67]. The NLRP3 (NALP3) inflammasome is the best understood and consists of NLRP3, the adaptor protein ASC and the protease caspase 1. Upon activation NLRP3 proteins oligomerize and recruit via homotypic PYD interactions, the PYD-CARD adaptor protein ASC. The formation of this complex then recruits and activates caspase 1 via its CARD domain. Caspase 1 is an inflammatory caspase that does not participate in apoptosis. Instead, activated caspase 1 processes numerous diverse cellular substrates including the cytokines IL-1β and IL-18. In the case of IL-1β, caspase 1 cleaves the 35 kDa pro-IL-1β to the mature and secreted 17 kDa cytokine. The potential targets of the inflammasome and caspase 1 go beyond cytokines such as IL-1β and IL-18. For example,

**Fig. 2. ZBP-1 and signaling.** ZBP-1 binds DNA via its Zα, Zβ and D3 domains. NFκB activation is mediated via a homotypic RHIM interaction with RIP1. RIP3 is also required and interacts with the ZBP-1 RHIM domain. Signaling to type I interferon pathways is mediated through the carboxy-terminal of the protein and involves TBK-1 and IRF3.

this platform, however the biological significance remains obscure [66,67].

NLRP3 is known to be activated by numerous microbial and non-microbial stimuli including bacterial peptidoglycan, ATP, monosodium urate and silica crystals suggesting that this inflammasome senses danger signals through a common but indirect mechanism. Recently, we demonstrated that the adenovirus activated the NLRP3 inflammasome in macrophages that was dependent on its dsDNA genome [9]. In the same cellular system, the transfection of naked DNA surprisingly triggered NLRP3-independent but ASC dependent caspase 1 activation and IL-1β maturation identifying a novel DNA-sensing inflammasome. The activation of this inflammasome was restricted to dsDNA in a size but not sequence-dependent manner consistent with previous observations regarding TLR9-independent DNA sensing. As such, the source of DNA was unimportant as viral, bacterial, mammalian and synthetic dsDNA could all activate caspase-1. These results also highlight that the innate response to DNA is regulated not only by the specificity of the respective innate receptors, but also by the localization of DNA in the cell. The internalization of viral DNA by adenovirus in macrophages proceeds through phagocytosis and triggers phagosome-linked PRRs such as the NLRP3 inflammasome and TLR9 [46,70] whereas cytosolic DNA triggers a completely different set of pathways.

Four studies identify the HIN-200 family member, AIM2, as the cytoplasmic sensor that mediates caspase 1 activation in response to cytoplasmic dsDNA [10–13] (Fig. 3). AIM2 is expressed in the cytosol and contains an HIN200 and a PYD domain. AIM2 binds directly to dsDNA, but not ssDNA through the C-terminal HIN200 domain resulting in AIM2 oligomerization and the recruitment of ASC through homotypic PYD interactions. The subsequent recruitment and activation of caspase 1 result in the formation of an AIM2 inflammasome that mediates IL-1β maturation and pyroptosis. Interestingly, these results document the assembly of an inflammasome by a protein outside of the NLR family and show the first evidence of a direct interaction between an inflammasome receptor and its ligand. DNA sensing and inflammasome formation is not a general feature of the other human HIN-200 family members, IFIX, IFI16 and MNDA that are primarily localized to the nucleus. Stacey and co-workers reported that the mouse HIN200 protein, p202 negatively regulated the AIM2 inflammasome. p202 contains two HIN domains but no PYD domain. p202 binds specifically to dsDNA in a sequence-independent but length-dependent manner, similar to AIM2 but cannot bind ASC and therefore appears to function as a dominant negative inhibitor. However, since p202 has no known human ortholog, its relevance remains unclear [13].

Importantly, the AIM2 inflammasome was critical for caspase-1 activation and cell death but completely dispensable for interferon-β induction in response to cytoplasmic DNA and thus distinct from the TLR-independent DNA sensing or ISD pathway. The discrete redundancy in innate immune pathways eliminates the potential for an “Achilles heel” that could be targeted by evolving pathogens such as viruses and provides the host several layers of antimicrobial defense. The physiological situations in which the AIM2 inflammasome pathway might be engaged and its relative place among the other pathogen- or danger-recognition systems remain unclear. The ability to activate cytosolic DNA sensors such as AIM2 with non-microbial or self-DNA sheds some light on the possible mechanism that drives the inflammatory response in patients with the autoimmune disease, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Both AIM2 and p202 fall within susceptibility loci for SLE in humans and mice, and p202 is differentially expressed between lupus-susceptible and lupus-resistant mice. Further research is required to clarify the involvement of the HIN-200 family in this and other diseases.

4. DNA sensing and the distinction of self

The recognition of nucleic acids by the innate immune system is regulated at various levels. One level of regulation involves ligand specificity of the different PRRs. Due to the ability of viruses and bacteria to rapidly evolve new strategies to avoid detection, it is logical to use a sensing system that targets critical microbial components that are present during all stages of their life cycle, indispensable for pathogen survival but absent from the host. Thus, highly conserved distinct pathogenic RNA and DNA sequences and structures are excellent targets for host recognition of foreign material. RLRs and TLRs detect specific patterns common in foreign RNA and DNA that are absent in host material such as long dsRNA, 5′-triphosphate RNA and unmethylated CpG DNA [1,16,71]. In the case of DNA viruses, which often use the host machinery to replicate, the distinction between self-DNA and viral DNA becomes less obvious. Regulation can therefore also occur based on PRR localization as described in the previous section. In this regard, the regulation and endosomal localization of receptors such as TLR9 prevents the inappropriate activation by endogenous DNA and focuses the innate response in compartments commonly used by pathogens [41,44]. The innate immune system has also been observed to respond to DAMPs (danger associated molecular patterns) released during infection and cellular injury. These endogenous signals include ATP, ROS (reactive oxygen species), uric acid and lysosomal stress [72–75]. DAMPs signal to the host that cells are injured or dying in an uncontrolled manner. These danger signals are important as dying cells may very well contain viral or microbial components. Thus DAMPs may act as an adjuvant to sensitize the cell to less distinct pathogenic constituents such as DNA and elicit an immune response. This process ensures that the immune system is primed at sites of potential infection and suggests that the response to DNA may also depend on the context and cellular conditions in which DNA is presented.

4.1. DNA regulating mechanisms and autoimmunity

The obvious problem with the use of nucleic acids as a target is the fact that nucleic acids are also present in the host. While systems have evolved to separate and delineate between host and pathogenic nucleic acids, they have also been known to fail, contributing to the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as SLE [36,37]. SLE is a multifactorial disease caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. In SLE, the presence of antinuclear antibodies against DNA and DNA structures such as nucleosomes [76,77] causes a wide range of pathology including arthritis, glomerulonephritis and vasculitis [78]. In addition to the regulatory mechanisms described above, the body must maintain constant vigilance in its clearance of endogenous unsequestered DNA to avoid the inappropriate activation of the innate immune system and the development of autoimmunity. Mammalian DNA is usually sequestered in the nucleus or mitochondria of cells except during replication or cell death when the nuclear envelope is compromised. Host nucleases such as DNaseI, DNaseII and TREX1 (DNaseIII) degrade endogenous DNA found in the extracellular space, endosomes and the cytosol. The presence of nucleases in endolysosomal compartments also limits the activation of innate receptors such as TLR9 by rapidly degrading internalized DNA. This is exemplified by the observation that DNA modifications that create nuclease resistant phosphothiorate-stabilized or 3′-polyguanosine oligonucleotides are potent TLR9 activators [38,43]. Therefore, it is not surprising that the failure to effectively clear endogenous DNA can lead to an inappropriate immune response with serious consequences.

Numerous studies show that nuclease deficiency or functional defects results in inappropriate immune activation. DNaseI deficiency, along with other environmental factors in both humans and mice, can lead to SLE [79]. DNasel gene mutations have been identified in a subgroup of patients with SLE, an observation that is supported by the SLE-like phenotype observed in DNasel-deficient mice. In both cases, the lack of DNasel activity is associated with the development of autoantibodies directed against dsDNA and nucleosomes that are strongly associated with glomerulonephritis in SLE patients [79,80]. DNasel is an essential endonuclease that, in conjunction with the proteolytic activity of plasmin degrades chromatin released from dying or necrotic cells to low molecular weight forms [81]. In the absence of DNasel, higher molecular weight DNA structures persist that are believed to be immunostimulatory. Similarly, the DNasell endonuclease plays a major role in the clearance of apoptotic DNA generated primarily during erythropoiesis. DNa-sell deficiency results in the accumulation of phagocytosed dsDNA in macrophages that induces TLR-independent interferon-β production that is lethal in mice [48,82]. On an interferon receptor 1 (IFNR1) deficient background or using a conditional knockout, the lethality of DNasell deficiency is rescued confirming the importance of type I interferons in mediating the observed murine phenotype. However the inability to process endogenous DNA persists and results in an autoimmune polyarthritis that mimics rheumatoid arthritis within 2 months of birth [83].

Recently, several studies have identified DNaseIII/TREX1 as a regulator of DNA homeostasis in the cell linked to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. TREX1 is the most abundant 3′–5′ DNA exonuclease [84,85]. Mutations in TREX1 have been identified in small groups of patients with SLE [86] and in combination with mutations in the RNaseH2 complex contributes to the pathogenesis of Aicardi-Goutières Syndrome (AGS), an inherited inflammatory disorder that targets the neurological system in children [87–90]. Patients with AGS suffer from a syndrome that mimics congenital infection with cytomegalovirus or rubella and consists of a progressive inflammatory encephalopathy with high levels of interferon-α in the cerebrospinal fluid. Studies in TREX1 deficient mice have been enlightening and provide some insight into the disease, the regulation of cellular DNA and autoimmunity. First, mice lacking TREX1 do not develop a syndrome that mimics human AGS emphasizing the multigenic and complex nature of this condition. Instead, TREX1 deficient mice have a reduced lifespan and succumb to an inflammatory myocarditis and cardiomyopathy within 2–4 months [91]. Yang et al. showed that TREX1 localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and translocated to BrdU positive foci at the nucleus primarily in S-phase cells following DNA damage. In the absence of TREX1, 60–65 bp ssDNA polynucleotides accumulated in the ER that were believed to be produced during DNA replication. The accumulation of ssDNA in TREX1 deficient cells was associated with chronic ATM-dependent DNA damage checkpoint signaling characterized by persistent p53 activation, elevated levels of the cyclin D/E dependent kinase inhibitor, p21 and defective G1/S transition [92]. However, at this time there is no known crosstalk between the DNA-damage response and the innate response to DNA. Further studies by Medzhitov and co-workers added clarity to the role of TREX1 in regulating the innate response to DNA. The inflammatory myocarditis observed in TREX1 deficient mice was substantially reduced or eliminated in animals bred onto IRF3 or IFNR1 deficient backgrounds. These data confirmed that an IRF3-dependent type I interferon response typical of TLR-independent DNA sensing or the ISD pathway was essential to initiate the heart disease. TREX1 itself is not a DNA sensor but instead regulates the accumulation of ssDNA that can trigger an innate immune response. Interestingly, cloning of accumulated ssDNA TREX1 substrates revealed a disproportionate amount of endogenous retrovirus elements in TREX1-deficient compared to wild type cells leading the researchers to conclude that TREX1 specifically targets reversed transcribed DNA [93]. Given that human AGS is also associated with mutations in the RNaseH2 complex.

plex that degrades RNA:DNA hybrids [94] occurring during reverse transcription, a potential link now exists between endogenous retroelements and autoimmunity via DNA sensing pathways in the cell. Future studies will hopefully provide clarity to this intriguing possibility. Together, these results highlight the critical importance of DNA regulating pathways in preventing self-activation of the innate immune system that results in autoimmunity.

## 5. Conclusions

Recent findings regarding the identity of cytosolic DNA sensors have provided a few answers to questions posed regarding the existence of TLR9 independent DNA sensing pathways. Similar to RNA sensing mechanisms that are mediated via TLRs in endosomal compartments and RLRs in the cytosol [95], a parallel system of cytosolic and endosomal DNA receptors are present in the cell that provide the host several layers of innate defense mechanisms to deal with pathogens that utilize different entry pathways during infection. Additional research into the biological significance of ZBP1 and the AIM2 inflammasome is required to further define their roles within the innate immune system. In addition, other cytosolic DNA sensors that mediate TLR-independent responses exist in the cell and remain to be identified. More importantly, it will be particularly interesting to determine the role of nucleic acid sensors in the pathogenesis of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.
