Abstract: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common human malignancy, affecting 750 000 Americans each year. The understanding of mutations that are known to activate hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway genes, including PATCHED (PTCH), sonic hedgehog (Shh) and smoothened (Smo), has substantially expanded our current understanding of the genetic basis of BCC development. The Hh signalling pathway is one of the most fundamental signal transduction pathways in embryonic development. In skin, the Shh pathway is crucial for maintaining stem cell population, and for regulating hair follicle and sebaceous gland development. This pathway plays a minimal role in adult tissues, but is known to be activated in many neoplasms, including those arising in the skin. In this review, we attempt to summarize the results of published studies on some important aspects of the Shh pathway and its involvement in skin development and carcinogenesis. We also provide a description of various animal models that have been developed, based on our knowledge of the Shh pathway in human skin cancers. Additionally, we include a brief description of studies conducted in our laboratory and by others on the chemoprevention of BCCs. This review therefore provides a current understanding of the role of the Shh pathway in skin development and neoplasia. It also provides a basis for the molecular target-based chemoprevention and therapeutic management of skin cancer.

Introduction

The hedgehog (Hh) signalling pathway is one of the most fundamental signal transduction pathways in embryonic development (1). In mammals, three Hh proteins are known: sonic hedgehog (Shh), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Desert hedgehog (Dhh). Shh is responsible for performing various important functions, which include neural tube patterning and adjacent ventral somites at the midline. It also participates in the development of left-right symmetry. It carries out a polarizing activity in the limbs and plays a role in the morphogenesis of various organs, including the axial skeleton, limbs, lungs, skin, hair and teeth (2). In skin, the Shh pathway is crucial for maintaining the stem cell population, and regulating the development of hair follicles and sebaceous glands (3). Ihh coordinates the proliferation and maturation of chondrocytes during the development of the endochondral skeleton (4). Dhh, on the other hand, regulates spermatogenesis and helps in the organization of perineurium, which ensheathes peripheral nerves (5). Out of all the Hh proteins, Shh is the best-characterized homologue. Shh is synthesized as a 45 kDa precursor protein that is cleaved auto-catalytically to a 20 kDa N-terminal fragment (residues 24–197 in the human gene sequence), which is responsible for all Hh biological activity, and a 25 kDa C-terminal fragment that contains the auto-processing unit. The N-terminal fragment, having two lipid tethers, a palmitic acid and a cholesterol, remains associated with the plasma

membrane. The receptor for Shh is the product of the tumor suppressor gene, *PTCH*. In addition, the protein PTCH acts as a negative regulator of Shh and, in its absence, PTCH represses the activation smoothened (Smo) a seven transmembrane domain protein, thereby blocking the expression of downstream target genes, which include, among others, *gli*, *PTCH* and members of the TGF-β family (6), as shown in Fig. 1.

Many pathways that play an essential role during the embryonic development are switched off later in life, during adulthood. Aberrant activation of these pathways in adult tissue is often oncogenic. Likewise, the Shh pathway, which has a minimal role in most adult tissues, is known to be activated in many neoplasms (7). The examples include basal cell carcinoma (BCC), medulloblastoma, rhabdomyosarcoma and other human tumors that are associated with abnormalities in Shh signalling components, including the mutational activation of the proto-oncogene Smo or mutational inactivation of the tumor suppressor PTCH. Smo and PTCH, both being membrane proteins, together mediate the cellular response to the Hh signal. Oncogenic mutations affecting these proteins enhance the activity of the Hh signalling pathway (8).

Abnormalities in Shh signalling pathway components that include Shh, PTCH1, Smo Glil and Gli2 are major contributing factors in the development of BCCs. As discussed earlier, PTCH1 represses Smo signalling. This repression is relieved by the binding of Shh to PTCH1 or following the mutational inactivation of PTCH1, leading to uncontrolled Smo signalling. *PTCH1* itself is a target gene of this pathway, and activation of the pathway increases PTCH1 expression (8). We, and others, have

observed PTCH1 protein and mRNA enhancement in BCCs; however, as this protein is presumably mutated, it remains inactive and incapable of inhibiting the Shh pathway (9). Signalling events downstream of Smo are not fully defined, but three *gli* gene products, which are transcription factors, are considered important in the pathogenesis of BCCs and are controlled by Smo signalling (8). Overexpression of Glil or Gli2 leads to BCC development in murine skin (10). However, Xie et al. showed that Glil can activate platelet-derived growth factor receptor α (PDGFRα). Increased expression of PDGFRα was also observed in murine and human BCCs (11). The roles of other known target molecules, such as the suppressor of fused [Su(Fu)] and protein kinase A (PKA), which are downstream of Smo in BCCs development, are also not fully defined (12). In addition, a putative antagonist of the pathway, hedgehog-interacting protein (HIP), was identified as a Hh-binding protein. HIP is also a target of Hh signalling and plays a role in promoting angiogenesis and cancer development (13). Recently, an actin-binding protein missing in metastasis (MIM) was identified as a new Shh-responsive gene. Together, Glil and MIM recapitulate Shh-mediated epidermal proliferation and tumor invasion pathways in human skin. MIM is a part of the Gli/Su(Fu) complex and potentiates Gli-dependent transcription, using domains distinct from those used for monomeric actin binding (14).

Alterations in Shh signalling are considered important in regulating proliferation and associated cell cycle events (15,16). Cell cycle exit before outward migration and terminal differentiation is a cardinal feature of normal stratified epithelial cells. Aberrant hair follicle morphogenesis in mice lacking Shh suggests that loss of Shh expression leads to suppression of epithelial cell expansion (17). Shh overexpression, however, leads to epidermal hyperplasia, accompanied by the proliferation of normally growth-arrested suprabasal keratinocytes in human skin grafted on to immune-compromised mice (18). In addition, Shh-expressing cells fail to exit the S and G2/M phases in response to calcium-induced differentiation signals (15). Shh expression has been shown to block the p21CIP1/WAF1-induced growth arrest in skin keratinocytes (19). In addition, PTCH1 protein interacts with phosphorylated cyclin B1 and blocks its translocation to the nucleus (20). Recently, it was shown that the phosphatase CDC25B, which is involved in G2/M transition, is

668transcriptionally upregulated by the Shh/Gli pathway (17,21). Thus this protein may be important in the regulation of the G2/M transition. Functionally inactive mutated PTCH1 protein is not able to block mitotic progression. The loss of regulation of cell cycle control is associated with the development of epithelial cancers in many tissues, including those that develop in skin. However, cell cycle regulation in BCCs remains undefined.

### Role in skin development

Shh signalling is known to regulate certain key processes in various stages of skin development. It also regulates the epithelial-mesenchymal interaction (22). The studies describing the role of this signalling in the maintenance of stem cells, and in the regulation of hair follicles and the sebaceous glands, are summarized below:

#### Stem cell regulation

The mammalian epidermis is maintained by the continuous proliferation of a subpopulation of keratinocytes known as epidermal stem cells (23). Transgenic mice carrying keratin 14 promoter-driven Shh, Dhh and Ihh in the basal cells of the skin provide knowledge on the role of Hh signalling in epidermal morphogenesis. Ihh overexpression did not lead to any overt epidermal morphogenesis phenotype; however, Dhh overexpression resulted in a range of embryonic and adult skin manifestations, which were indistinguishable from Shh overexpression. Two distinct novel phenotypes observed in Shh and Dhh transgenic animals include the manifestation of epidermal progenitor cell hyperplasia and an almost total loss of epidermal tissue renewal capability, indicating the deregulation of stem cell activity. These data suggest that correct temporal regulation of Hh activity is a key factor in regulating epidermal stem cell maintenance (24).

The basal layer of human fetal epidermis, as well as freshly sorted human putative epidermal stem cells (HPESCs), show a detectable expression of Shh, its receptors PTCH1, Smo and its downstream transcription factor, Gli-1. Treatment of HPESCs with media conditioned by Shh-N-expressing cells augments cell proliferation; conversely, inhibition of Shh by cyclopamine blocks proliferation. Similarly, the mitogenic effect of epidermal growth factor (EGF) on HPESCs can also be abolished by cyclopamine. Furthermore, the expression of

Hedgehog signalling in skin development and cancer bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), which is a potential downstream effector of Shh signalling, increases HPESC proliferation (25).

### Sebaceous gland development

Epithelial progenitor cells in skin give rise to multiple lineages, comprising the hair follicle, an associated sebaceous gland, and the overlying epidermis. It has been shown that inhibition of the Hh pathway selectively suppresses sebocyte development, whereas its activation leads to enhancement in both size and number of sebaceous glands (26). Interestingly, ectopic Hh signalling triggers the formation of sebaceous glands, even from footpad epidermis, which is normally devoid of hair follicles and associated structures (26). These sebaceous glands expressed molecular markers of sebocyte differentiation and were functional. It has been found that these glands secrete their contents directly onto the skin's surface instead of into a hair canal (26).

In mammalian epidermis, the level of β-catenin signalling regulates lineage selection by stem cell progeny. High levels of β-catenin stimulate the formation of hair follicles, whereas low levels favour differentiation into interfollicular epidermis and sebocytes (27). In normal sebaceous glands, Ihh is expressed in differentiated sebocytes, whereas Glil is activated in sebocyte progenitors, suggesting a paracrine signalling mechanism. Ptch1 and Ihh are upregulated during human sebocyte differentiation, and inhibition of Hh signalling inhibits growth and stimulates differentiation. Overexpression of DeltaNLevl upregulates Ihh and stimulates the proliferation of undifferentiated sebocytes (27,28).

### Hair follicle development

Mammalian hair represents an unparalleled model for understanding both developmental processes and stem cell biology, as it is a source of epithelial stem cells. Shh signalling in skin controls the growth and morphogenesis of hair follicle epithelium in part through regulating the Gli transcription factors (29). It has been shown that during the hair cycle, Shh expression and the ability of skin cells to respond to Shh signalling are spatially and temporally regulated (30). Induction of Shh target genes normally occurs only in the anagen hair follicle in response to expression of Shh. Shh⁻/⁻ embryos show detectable hair germs,Athar et al.

comprising epidermal placodes and associated dermal condensates similar to those that can be seen in the control Shh<sup>+/+</sup> embryos (31). However, the progression through subsequent stages of hair follicle development was blocked in the mutant Shh skin. Consistently, reduced expression of Glil and Ptch1 can be observed in Shh<sup>-/-</sup> dermal condensates that fail to evolve into hair follicle papillae. These data suggest that the adjacent mesenchyme is a critical target for placode-derived Shh. It is laudable that despite the profound inhibition of hair follicle morphogenesis, late-stage follicle differentiation markers are detectable in Shh<sup>-/-</sup> skin grafts, as well as cultured vibrissa explants treated with cycloamine (28,32).

The hair follicle consists of several concentric epithelial sheaths, with the outer root sheath (ORS) forming the outermost layer. Functionally, the ORS has been implicated in the migration of hair stem cells from the stem cell niche towards the hair bulb. It has been demonstrated that Sox9 expression, which depends on Shh signalling, can first be detected in the epithelial component of the hair placode, but then becomes restricted to the ORS and the hair stem cell compartment (bulge). Sox9 encodes a HMG-box transcription factor. Tissue-specific inactivation of Sox9 demonstrates that this gene is crucial for hair differentiation. Skin deletion of Sox9 results in the appearance of external hair, accompanied by severe proliferative defects and abolition in the formation of a stem cell niche. Furthermore, ectopic expression of the transcription factor, GATA3, in the ORS results in acquiring epidermal characteristics (33).

β-Catenin is an essential molecule in Wnt/wingless signalling, which also controls some decisive steps in embryogenesis. It has been shown that mutant β-catenin is incapable of forming placodes that generate hair follicles during embryogenesis. Furthermore, the requirement of β-catenin for placode formation occurs downstream of tabby/downless and upstream of Bmp and Shh. Deletion of β-catenin following the hair follicle formation leads to complete hair loss after the first hair cycle. In addition, the absence of β-catenin leads to failure of stem cell differentiation into follicular keratinocytes (34).

### Role in skin cancer development

Non-melanoma skin cancers, which include BCCs and squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs), are the most common form of human neoplasia, affecting about 1 million Americans each year. Of these, BCC alone is responsible for 750,000 new cases each year. It is estimated that one in three Caucasians born in the USA after 1994 will develop at least one BCC in their lifetime (35).

The risk factor for this skin neoplasm includes mainly environmental exposure to solar ultraviolet B (UVB) (35,36). Prolonged immune suppression, such as organ transplantation patients, may also enhance the risk of BCCs development (37). Additionally, patients afflicted with the rare autosomal dominantly inherited disorder known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) or Gorlin's syndrome have a substantially increased susceptibility to BCCs and some extracutaneous tumors (38). These patients develop dozens to hundreds of BCCs and extracutaneous tumors such as medulloblastomas (4%), meningiomas (5%), fibromas (18%), rhabdomyomas and rhabdomyosarcomas (39). In addition, they manifest jaw keratocysts and ectopic calcification, closure defects of the spinal cord, rib defects, palate abnormalities, coarse facies, hypertelorism, macrocephaly and skeletal abnormalities with generalized bony and soft tissue over-growth. BCCs develop early and increase with age. These tumors occur in up to 97% of individuals with NBCCS. In these patients, BCCs may develop on any part of the body, but they are encountered more frequently in sun-exposed skin, suggesting that UVB-exposure exacerbates their development. The location of these defects correlates with the sites of Ptch expression during mammalian embryogenesis. Whereas the skeletal defects usually appear at birth, the other stigmata of the syndrome appear later in life. NBCCS has an incidence of only 1:56,000 (8).

PTCH gene mutations have been identified in these patients (40). In addition, NBCCS-associated BCCs and jaw cysts retain a mutant germ-line PTCH allele and lose the wild-type PTCH gene mutation and loss of the wild-type allele also occur in sporadic medulloblastomas and meningiomas. NBCCS patients are born with only one functional allele and are susceptible to developing rare CNS tumors and BCCs in greater numbers and at a younger age than do patients with sporadic BCCs. It is believed that BCCs mostly originate from hair follicles.

UVB induces structural changes in epidermal DNA, which are characterized by C to T or CC to TT transitions (UVB signature mutations) located at pyrimidine-pyrimidine sequences andare the result of the formation of cyclobutane–pyrimidine dimers. In addition, UVB exposure also leads to (6-4) pyrimidine-pyrimidone photo-products formation (41, 42). These mutations have been identified in several genes, including ras oncogene, p53 and PTCH tumor suppressor genes isolated from skin cancers occurring on sun-exposed body sites (43, 44). These mutations occur in 30–60% of skin cancers that develop in DNA repair-proficient individuals, but this number increases to 50–80% in skin cancers excised from patients with XP, who have an impaired DNA repair mechanism. It has been shown that 50–60% of sporadic BCCs from DNA-proficient and XP patients have point mutations in the PTCH gene (43). PTCH gene mutations are important in the development of BCCs. Sporadic BCCs, which do not have mutations in this gene, carry mutations in the Smo gene (45).

An understanding of the mutations activating the Hh signalling pathway genes has therefore substantially expanded our current knowledge of the genetic basis of BCC development. During the past decade, based on the identification of abnormalities in the Shh signalling pathway and mutations in many genes related to this pathway, a number of murine models of BCCs were developed with the objective of investigating the biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this neoplasm in humans. Some of the important murine models are discussed in the following section.

### Animal models of basal cell carcinoma

Murine models of skin carcinogenesis have provided an increased understanding of the steps involved in the pathogenesis of NMSCs. The exact pathways leading to SCCs development remain undefined at the genetic and molecular levels. However, molecular changes occurring during the pathogenesis of BCCs have recently been defined, based on the identification of abnormalities in the Hh signalling pathway. The following important genetically engineered mouse models are described in the literature. These mice develop skin tumors spontaneously, and/or following treatment with radiation.

#### Shh mice

A keratin 14 (K14) promoter-driven Shh transgenic mouse expressing high levels of Shh and Ptch mRNA in the epidermis displays several phenotypic characteristics of NBCCS patients,

#### Hedgehog signalling in skin development and cancer

including polydactyly, spina bifida, and multiple BCC-like epidermal proliferations during early cutaneous development. However, these mice are not viable beyond the perinatal period, limiting their utility for the study of NBCCS and BCC development (46).

#### $SMO^{mut}$ transgenic mice

A keratin-5 (K5) promoter-driven expression of mutant Smo in murine epidermis leads to the expression of high levels of mutant Smo protein in the basal layer of the epidermis. These mice carrying mutant Smo develop BCC-like cutaneous tumors. However, they do not produce viable offspring (40).

#### Patched heterozygous knockout mice

$Ptch^{+/−}$ knockout mice were developed by deleting exons 1 and 2 and inserting the Lac reporter gene at the deleted site. Homozygous knockout mice die in utero, but heterozygotes survive to adulthood. These mice resemble $PTCH^{+/−}$ humans and exhibit developmental abnormalities and few extracutaneous tumors (medulloblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas, polydactyly and jaw cysts). At 3–17 months of age, the skin of these mice looks grossly normal, but biopsies show microscopically detectable basaloid cell proliferation, some resembling BCCs and others resembling trichoblastomas. UVB or γ-ray irradiation of these mice produces visible BCCs. These mice produce viable offspring (44).

#### Glil transgenic mice

A keratin-5-driven overexpression of the human glil in mouse skin leads to development of tumors that closely resemble human BCCs, as well as other hair follicle-derived neoplasias, such as trichoepitheliomas, cylindromas and trichoblastomas. Furthermore, these tumors carry wild-type p53 and Ha-ras genes. Similarly, an overexpression of Glil in frog embryo epidermis, by injecting ectodermal cells with a glil construct, produces an amphibian model of BCC tumorigenesis. Transfected frog embryos show Glil overexpression, activation of Hh target genes and BCC-like tumors (47).

#### Gli2 transgenic mice

Transgenic mice overexpressing gli2 (under the control of a bovine K5 promoter) develop multiple skin tumors, found on the ears, tail,Athar et al.

trunk and dorsal aspects of the paws. Tumors in albino mice show characteristics of sporadic human BCCs, whereas black mice exhibit the features of pigmented BCCs (48).

$P t c h^{+/}$ mice overexpressing ornithine decarboxylase

Most of the murine models that have been described in the preceding section develop only a few BCCs, similar to the sporadic BCCs that develop in humans. However, as described earlier, NBCCS patients develop dozens to hundreds of BCCs. To test whether increased basal levels of ornithine decarboxylate (ODC), which plays a crucial role in tumor development by driving the continued proliferation and selective clonal expansion of initiated cells in epithelial tissues, enhances the growth of BCCs development, we bred female $P t c h^{+/}$ heterozygous mice with male K6/ODC transgenic mice [C57BL/6Ntac-TgN (K6ODC) 55]. These compound $P t c h^{+/}$ heterozygous mice that overexpress ODC have a normal first hair cycle, followed by progressive hair loss, beginning at 2–3 weeks of age, and excessive nail growth. With increasing age, the skin exhibits pronounced wrinkling and folding. These mice develop a few microscopic BCC-like lesions spontaneously, but developed multiple small tumors all over the dorsal skin following exposure to UVB, similar to those that develop in NBCCS patients (9).

Chemoprevention of BCCs

Preventive strategies to reduce cancer risk are being studied extensively worldwide. In this regard, administering agents that are relatively non-toxic and have potential to block or delay the development of cancer are particularly important and the modality that utilizes this approach is known as chemoprevention.

cancer. Recently, a number of molecular targets have been identified, which if blocked lead to reduction in the growth of neoplasia. In the following section, we will discuss the molecular targets that may be important for the chemoprevention of BCCs in skin. There are only a few published studies that describe chemoprevention of BCCs. Some of these studies that utilize molecular target-based chemoprevention of this type of neoplasm are summarized as Table 1.

$\alpha$-Difluoromethyl-DL-ornithine targeting ODC and polyamine pathway

ODC is the first and rate-limiting enzyme of the polyamine biosynthesis pathway and catalyses the synthesis of putrescine from ornithine. Putrescine is an essential building block required for the production of higher polyamines, spermidine and spermine, which are formed from the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase-dependent conversion of putrescine (49). It is known that polyamines are critical for normal and neoplastic cell growth. In human SCCs and BCCs, high levels of polyamines and ODC activity were observed (50, 51). Cellular polyamine content was tightly regulated by various mechanisms, including transcriptional, translational and post-translational regulation of the enzymes responsible for polyamine synthesis and catabolism, as well as a highly inducible polyamine transport system. A multifunctional protein known as antizyme (AZ) exerts post-translational control of ODC (49). AZ interacts with ODC and forms a complex, which is degraded through proteosomal degradation. This leads to depletion in the tissue ODC activity and consequent polyamine levels. To assess the importance of ODC-dependent production of polyamines and their involvement in the pathogenesis of BCCs, we applied multiple approaches to incorporate

both genetic and pharmacological experimental design. We tested whether AZ overexpression reduces the growth of UVB-induced BCCs. For this we developed *Ptch1*<sup>+/−</sup> mice that overexpressed AZ in the skin. As expected AZ overexpression in these mice leads to decreased ODC activity and polyamine content, following cutaneous exposure of UVB. These animals were also resistant to UVB-induced BCCs development (9). To further investigate whether blocking ODC activity can diminish the development of UVB-induced BCCs, we employed α-difluoromethyl-DL-ornithine (DFMO), a synthetic agent that is an analogue of ornithine (Fig. 2) and irreversibly inhibits ODC activity. The mechanism of ODC activity inhibition by this agent involves enzymatic decarboxylation of DFMO to a carbon ionic intermediate which, following the loss of fluorine, alkylates nucleophilic residue near or at the active site of this enzyme. This covalent modification of the active site leads to its suicidal inhibition (52).

The administration of DFMO to *Ptch1*<sup>+/−</sup> knockout mice depletes the levels of polyamines in the skin. Similar to the results obtained following genetic inhibition of ODC activity, DFMO reduced the growth of UVB-induced BCCs (9). Our data favour the organization of an extensive clinical evaluation of DFMO as a potential chemopreventive agent for diminishing the growth of BCCs in NBCCS patients, although there are only a few published human studies related to skin cancer and DFMO. These include a randomized, placebo-controlled phase IIb trial (*n* = 47), in which DFMO was shown to reduce skin polyamine concentrations significantly, as well as the total number of actinic keratoses (AKs) when applied topically to the forearms of patients with at least 10 distinct AKs on each forearm (53). AKs represent benign lesions, which are considered precursors of SCCs in skin. It is interesting to note that on the NIH website, there is a listing of an ongoing randomized phase-III clinical trial that utilizes DFMO as a cancer chemopreventive agent in patients who have previously received

Hedgehog signalling in skin development and cancer treatment for early-stage skin cancer. The objective of this trial is to prevent the recurrence of skin cancer, including BCCs, through the oral administration of DFMO.

**Cyclopamine and synthetic analogues targeting Shh pathway**

Cyclopamine (for structure, please see Fig. 3) is a plant-derived steroidal alkaloid, that is known to inhibit the activated Shh pathway by antagonizing Smo. Historically, sheep eating specific lily plants that are known to contain this agent during pregnancy gave birth to offspring with severe developmental defects, such as holoprosencephaly and its severe form is cyclopia or development of one-eyed animals. Based on this ability, the agent that induced cyclopia in experimental models was designated as cyclopamine (54). Later, cyclopamine became popular in genetics research, having been proven to be a specific inhibitor of Shh signalling (55). In subsequent studies, this agent has been successfully employed as a tool to demonstrate the importance of the Hh signalling pathway during morphogenesis and organogenesis. Important examples of the discoveries in which cyclopamine was employed for defining the role of genes of this pathway include the development of the brain, pancreatic islets, limbs, face (craniofacial development), skin (hair follicle), testes, gut, erythroid differentiation.

Numerous naturally occurring and synthetic compounds, which were discovered because of their toxic properties, later showed biological activities that were potentially beneficial to humans. These agents served as templates for the development of useful medicinal agents. Thalidomide is one such example; it gained popularity despite its catastrophic teratogenicity in humans, because it later proved highly useful for treating several diseases, resulting in the recrudescence of the drug. Cyclopamine may be

a similar example (56, 57). Recently, our studies showed the specificity and potential utility of cycloamine in switching off the activated Shh pathway, leading to the blockage of BCCs development in \( Ptch^{+/−} \) mice. As abnormal activation of the Hh signalling pathway is pivotal in driving the growth of BCCs, we argued that antagonists of this pathway, such as cycloamine, may be of potential utility for the prevention and treatment of this skin neoplasm. Our laboratory showed that chronic oral administration of cycloamine dramatically reduces (~66%) UVB-induced BCCs in \( Ptch^{+/−} \) mice. We assessed whether Fas expression, which is low in human and murine BCCs, may be upregulated by cycloamine and may induce apoptosis in cancer cells. We found that cycloamine indeed induced Fas expression, both in the mouse BCC cell line ASZ001 and in murine BCCs. Interestingly, this parallels an enhancement in apoptosis. As cycloamine is a SMO antagonist, in these studies we also confirmed that the expression of activated SMO in C3H10T1/2 cells inhibits Fas expression. We therefore showed that Fas/Fas ligand interactions are necessary for cycloamine-mediated apoptosis in these cells, and involves caspase-8 activation (58). We believe that as its toxicity appears to be limited to the inhibition of Shh pathway-dependent teratogenicity, it is a promising agent for the mechanism-based prevention of BCC formation in non-pregnant individuals particularly afflicted with NBCCS.

In a separate study, Williams et al. identified a small molecule Hh inhibitor, which they coded as CUR61414. They showed that it can block elevated Hh signalling activity resulting from oncogenic mutations in \( Ptch1 \). They also showed that CUR61414 can suppress proliferation and induce apoptosis of basaloid nests in the murine BCC model system, whereas it had no effect on normal skin cells (59).

Immunization targeting Shh pathway

In a separate study, we showed that immunization with proteins specifically upregulated by Hh signalling may hold promise for the prevention of BCCs in patients with the NBCCS. To demonstrate this, we used one of the target genes of Hh signalling, hedgehog-interacting protein (Hip1), as a tumor-associated antigen for immunoprevention of BCCs in \( Ptch1^{+/−} \) mice treated with ionizing radiation. Hip1 mRNA is expressed in adult mouse tissues at levels considerably lower than those in BCCs.

Immunization with either of two large recombinant Hip1 polypeptides is well tolerated in \( Ptch1^{+/−} \) mice, and reduces the number of BCCs by 42% and 32%, respectively (13).

As described on the Genentech website, Curis in collaboration with Genentech initiated preclinical and phase-I clinical trials for the Hh antagonist (CUR-61414) and antibody for cancer treatment. Preliminary clinical data were presented and suggest that a topical Hedgehog antagonist studied in 34 patients with BCC was generally well tolerated. The multi-center phase I study evaluated the safety and tolerability of four dose levels of a topically applied Hedgehog antagonist in subjects with superficial or nodular BCC. Subjects were randomized to receive 4 weeks of administration with the Hedgehog antagonist or a placebo. Safety was assessed by measuring incidence of local skin reactions at the treatment site; incidence of adverse events, including serious or severe adverse events; and incidence of laboratory abnormalities. All of the adverse events reported for the 34 patients were mild or moderate except for severe erythema (redness of the skin) in one patient dosed at the highest dose level. The pharmacodynamic portion of the trial is ongoing, and the trial is still blinded. Further details of these studies are not posted there.

Sirolimus targeting multiple pathways

Another agent, though of a different class, is rapamycin (for structure, please see Fig. 4), also known as sirolimus, which is an immunosuppressant and is often chronically administered to organ transplant patients, either alone or with other strong immunosuppressing agents (60). Rapamycin was found to be an inhibitor of Glil

Figure 4. Chemical structure of rapamycin.(61). It was also shown to inhibit proliferation of T and B cells transformed by human T-cell lymphotropic virus-1 and Epstein-Barr virus (62). Organ transplant patients are often at high risk of developing malignancies, particularly skin cancers that include both BCCs and SCCs (63). Based on rapamycin's ability to inhibit the terminal effector of the Shh pathway, it may be hypothesized that transplant patients receiving rapamycin should be at a lower risk of developing skin cancers, particularly BCCs, when compared with a patient population kept on other immunosuppressants. In a recent multicentre study in which 2-year incidence of malignancy was recorded in renal transplant recipients, it was shown that patients receiving sirolimus immunotherapy without cyclosporine have a significantly lower incidence of malignancy than patients receiving sirolimus in combination with cyclosporine (64).

Similarly, the incidence of Kaposi’s sarcoma increases in solid organ transplant recipients. Kaposi’s sarcoma is a spindle-shaped vascular cell tumor that occurs in the skin, lymphoid, respiratory and gastrointestinal tissues. It may resemble aggressive malignant neoplasm in HIV-related or in post-transplant types, but the classic form may behave as a benign, potentially controllable and reversible phenotype. This neoplasm was also shown to be sensitive to sirolimus, as patients receiving sirolimus have a lower incidence of this cancer development or progression (65).

### Shh signalling as a potential target for drug development

The role of Shh pathway is becoming clear in the pathogenesis of a variety of neoplasms in various organs besides skin. It has been shown that this pathway is activated in gastrointestinal, prostate, pancreatic, hepatic, neuronal and ovarian cancers. The essential role of this pathway is also known at different stages of embryonic development and aberrant inactivation of this pathway during the embryogenesis results in severe birth defects. Therefore, the antagonists as well as agonists of this pathway may play important regulatory and curative roles. Development of small molecules that may specifically perform these antagonistic or agonistic pharmacological functions and have no or little toxic/adverse effects may be the agents of great clinical importance for the cure of Shh pathway-associated cancers or developmental defects particularly in high risk population.

## Hedgehog signalling in skin development and cancer

### Conclusions and future directions

Shh signalling pathway is an important pathway regulating stem cell population in skin. This property associated with Shh pathway may be exploited in favour of developing novel therapeutics for the treatment of various skin diseases including skin cancer. As aberrant activation of this pathway is related to enhanced proliferation followed by development of neoplasia in skin and in other tissues, development of specific and potent small molecule inhibitor of this pathway may be helpful in providing successful therapeutic intervention for Shh pathway-dependent neoplasms.
