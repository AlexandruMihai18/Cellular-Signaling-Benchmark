Osteoimmunology is an interdisciplinary research field that investigates the interplay of the skeletal and immune systems at the molecular level. The interaction between immune cells and osteoclasts has been a major topic in this field. As osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, the macrophage-osteoclast interaction has long been studied. The T cell-osteoclast interaction has also attracted much attention in the study of bone destruction in arthritis. In addition, recent reports have revealed new players linking osteoclasts and other immune cells, including B cells and dendritic cells. Thus, a large number of molecules are in fact shared by osteoclasts and immune cells. These findings will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases affecting both systems and will provide a molecular basis for novel therapeutic strategies.

## Introduction

A close relationship between the immune and skeletal systems has been noted for many years. For example, the interaction between monocytes/macrophages and osteoclasts was appreciated in the pioneering works performed in the early 1970s. Soluble factors secreted from antigen-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells came to be known as osteoclast-activating factors, one of which was revealed to be interleukin-1 (IL-1). It is now well known that numerous macrophage-derived cytokines influence osteoclast differentiation and/or function. In addition, osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF), which is essential for the development and survival of the lineage, is indispensable for osteoclast differentiation. Therefore, the importance of monocytes/macrophages in osteoclast biology is well established.

The interaction between T cells and osteoclasts is seen in the abnormal activation of the immune system in certain autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, an aberrant behavior which leads to bone destruction. The major cytokine that regulates osteoclast differentiation is receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL). RANKL is not only expressed by the osteoblasts that support osteoclastogenesis in bone tissue but also by activated T cells, suggesting that osteoclastic bone resorption is influenced by T cells. However, it is notable that most of the T-cell cytokines, including interferon (IFN)-γ, IL-4, and IL-10, inhibit osteoclastogenesis. Our laboratory identified IL-17-producing T helper (Th) 17 cells as the exclusive osteoclastogenic T-cell subset. IL-17 induces RANKL on osteoclastogenesis-supporting mesenchymal cells, such as osteoblasts. IL-17 also enhances local inflammation and increases the production of inflammatory cytokines, which further promote RANKL expression and activity (Fig. 1). Thus, the interactions of T cells and osteoclasts have a crucial role in the pathogenesis of bone loss in arthritis.

Figure 1. Regulation of osteoclast differentiation by T cells in inflammation. T helper 17 (Th17) cells have stimulatory effects on osteoclastogenesis and play an important role in the pathogenesis of rheumatoid arthritis through interleukin (IL)-17, while Th1 and Th2 cells have inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis through interferon (IFN)-γ and IL-4, respectively. IL-17 not only induces receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL) on osteoblasts/synovial fibroblasts of mesenchymal origin but also activates local inflammation, leading to the upregulation of inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α, IL-1, and IL-6. These cytokines further increase RANKL on mesenchymal cells and, in addition, act directly on the osteoclast precursor cells to enhance RANKL activity.

Signal transduction downstream of RANKL/RANK

The interaction of RANKL with RANK results in trimerization of RANK and recruitment of adaptor molecules, such as the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins, among which TRAF6 has been revealed to be the major adaptor molecule. TRAF6 also trimerizes upon RANK stimulation and activates NF-κB and mitogen-activated kinases (MAPKs), including JUN N-terminal kinase and p38. The essential role of NF-κB in osteoclastogenesis has been shown genetically, but the *in vivo* function of each MAPK remains to be elucidated. The lysine 63-linked polyubiquitination mediated by the RING (really interesting new gene)-finger motif of TRAF6 has been shown to be important for NF-κB activation in other cell types, but deletion analysis has indicated that the RING-finger domain of TRAF6 is dispensable for the formation of osteoclasts. Therefore, the importance of the ubiquitin-ligase activity of TRAF6 in osteoclastogenesis needs to be tested *in vivo*. Receptors that activate TRAF6 include CD40, Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and interleukin-1 (IL-1) receptor, but RANK alone is able to strongly stimulate osteoclastogenesis. It might be that additional RANK-specific adaptor molecule(s) exist and enhance TRAF6 signaling. For example, the molecular scaffold GRB2-associated binding protein 2 has been shown to be associated with RANK and to have an important role in its signal transduction. Signaling crosstalk between RANKL and M-CSF, another essential cytokine for osteoclast differentiation, might be crucially important for osteoclastogenesis.

Crosstalk between RANKL and other cytokine systems

Osteoclasts are derived from the monocyte/macrophage lineage, and the precursor cells express various cytokine receptors. Inflammatory cytokines that are mainly produced by macrophages, such as IL-1, TNF-α, and IL-6, promote osteoclastogenesis and are also called osteolytic cytokines based on their bone resorptive effect *in vivo*. IL-1 stimulates TRAF6 (and therefore activates NF-κB and MAPKs) and synergizes with RANKL to induce mature osteoclasts to carry out bone-resorbing activity, but interestingly IL-1 alone cannot induce differentiation, indicating that TRAF6 activation is not sufficient. IL-1 also

indirectly facilitates osteoclastogenesis by acting
on the osteoblasts through the induction of
prostaglandin E₂, and induces the expression of
RANKL. TNF-α stimulates the activation of NF-κB
mainly through TRAF2. Although TNF-α alone
cannot induce osteoclastogenesis in vivo nor can
TNF-α overexpression rescue the deficiency of
RANKL,¹⁶,¹⁷ it is reported that TNF-α plus trans-
forming growth factor-β (TGF-β) induces in vitro
osteoclastogenesis even in the absence of RANK
or TRAF6.¹⁸ These results indicate that TNF-α
has a pivotal role in the pathological activation of
osteoclasts associated with inflammation.
Type I interferons (IFN-α and IFN-β) are es-
sential for host defense against pathogens, such
as viruses. RANKL induces the IFNB gene in os-
teoclast precursor cells, and IFN-β functions as a
negative-feedback regulator that inhibits the dif-
ferentiation of osteoclasts by interfering with the
RANKL-induced expression of c-Fos. The impor-
tance of type I IFNs in bone homeostasis was un-
derscored by the observation that mice deficient in
the type I IFN-receptor component IFNAR1 spon-
taneously develop marked osteopenia, accompanied
by enhanced osteoclastogenesis.¹⁹
As T-cell activation is often associated with ab-
normal bone resorption, the regulation of bone
metabolism by T-cell cytokines is of great clinical
significance. T cells express RANKL, but major T-
cell cytokines, such as IFN-γ, IL-4, and IL-10 are all
inhibitory to in vitro osteoclastogenesis, and IL-12
and IL-18 also negatively affect osteoclastogenesis.¹⁹
T-cell cytokines that positively regulate osteoclasto-
genesis include RANKL, TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-17.
If RANKL is expressed in activated T cells, T cells
might have the capacity to induce osteoclast differ-
entiation by directly acting on osteoclast precursor
cells, but the IFN-γ produced by T cells potently
suppresses RANKL signaling through downregula-
tion of TRAF6.⁵ Thus, the effects of T cells on os-
teoclastogenesis should be dependent on the balance
between positive and negative factors expressed by
the T cells. Effector CD4⁺ Th-cell subsets Th1 and
Th2 produce IFN-γ and IL-4, both of which are
anti-osteoclastogenic (Fig. 1). As mentioned in the
introduction, it has been shown that Th17 cells func-
tion as the exclusive osteoclastogenic T-cell subset
among the known Th-cell subsets and their effects
are mainly explained by IL-17-mediated induction
of RANKL in mesenchymal cells.⁶

Transcriptional regulation of
osteoclastogenesis

RANK activates the transcription-factor complex,
activator protein 1 (AP1), through the induction of
its component c-Fos.²⁰ The induction mechanism
of c-Fos is not completely understood, but recent re-
ports suggest that it is dependent on the activation
of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent kinase IV and the
cyclic adenosine monophosphate response element-
binding protein (CREB)²¹ as well as the activation of
NF-κB.²² RANKL specifically and potently induces
nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1
(NFATc1), the master regulator of osteoclast differ-
entiation, and this induction is dependent on both
the TRAF6 and c-Fos pathways.²³ The activation of
NFAT is mediated by a specific phosphatase, cal-
cineurin, which is activated by calcium-calmodulin
signaling. The NFATc1 promoter contains NFAT
binding sites, and NFATc1 specifically autoregu-
lates its own promoter during osteoclastogenesis,
thus effecting the robust induction of NFATc1.²⁴
NFATc1 regulates a number of osteoclast-specific
genes, such as cathepsin K, tartrate-resistant acid
phosphatase, calcitonin receptor, OSCAR, and β3 in-
tegrin, in cooperation with other transcription fac-
tors, such as AP1, PU.1, microphthalmia-associated
transcription factor (MITF), and CREB.⁷
NFATc1 was originally identified in T cells, but
this transcription factor was subsequently revealed
to play a crucial role in osteoclastogenesis. It is also
worthy to note that calcium signaling and its down-
stream effector molecules are shared by osteoclasts
and T cells.

Co-stimulatory signals along with RANK

Osteoclasts are formed when bone marrow cells
are stimulated with RANKL and M-CSF in a cul-
ture system, and therefore it has been thought that
RANK and c-Fms together transmit the signals suf-
ficient for osteoclastogenesis. However, a novel type
of receptor has been revealed to be highly expressed
in osteoclasts. Osteoclast-associated receptor
(OSCAR) was shown to be an immunoglobulin-
like receptor involved in the cell–cell interaction
between osteoblasts and osteoclasts.²⁵ Subsequent
studies showed that OSCAR associates with an
adaptor molecule, Fc receptor common γ sub-
unit (FcRγ),²⁶ which harbors an immunorecep-
tor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) critical

Figure 2. Osteoclastogenic signal transduction. RANK activates the NF-κB and c-Fos pathways that stimulate the induction of nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1). Immunoglobulin-like receptors associate with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-harboring adaptors, Fc receptor common γ subunit (FcRγ), and DNAX-activating protein 12 (DAP12). RANK and ITAM signaling cooperate to phosphorylate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and activate calcium signaling, which is critical for the activation and autoamplification of NFATc1. Tec tyrosine kinases (Tec and Btk) activated by RANK are important for the formation of the osteoclastogenic signaling complex composed of Tec kinases, B-cell linker (BLNK)/SH2 domain containing leukocyte protein of 76 kDa (SLP-76) (activated by ITAM-Syk), and PLCγ, which are essential for the efficient phosphorylation of PLCγ.

for the activation of calcium signaling in immune cells. Another ITAM-harboring adaptor, DNAX activating protein 12 (DAP12), has been reported to be involved in the formation and function of osteoclasts. Importantly, mice doubly deficient in FcRγ and DAP12 exhibit severe osteopetrosis owing to a differentiation blockade of osteoclasts, demonstrating that the immunoglobulin-like receptors associated with FcRγ and DAP12 are essential for osteoclastogenesis. These receptors include OSCAR, triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells-2, signal-regulatory protein β1, and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor-A, although the ligand and exact function of each of these receptors remain to be determined. ITAM-mediated signals cooperate with RANK to stimulate calcium signaling through ITAM phosphorylation and the resulting activation of Syk and

Figure 3. A cathepsin K inhibitor suppresses both autoimmune inflammation and bone destruction. Cathepsin K is involved in the Toll-like receptor (TLR) 9-mediated activation of dendritic cells (DCs) as well as osteoclastic bone resorption. Cathepsin K inhibition results in the reduced expression of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 and IL-23, which are important for the induction of Th17 cells. Thus, a cathepsin K inhibitor has dual benefits in the treatment of arthritis.

phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ). Therefore, these signals should properly be called co-stimulatory signals for RANK. Initially characterized in natural killer and myeloid cells, the immunoglobulin-like receptors associated with FcRγ or DAP12 are thus identified as previously unexpected but nevertheless essential partners of RANK during osteoclastogenesis. It is not fully understood how RANK can specifically induce osteoclastogenesis in cooperation with ITAM signaling, but it is at least partially explained by the observation that phosphorylation of ITAM is upregulated by RANKL.²⁶,²⁸ In addition, RANKL stimulation results in an increased expression of immunoreceptors, such as OSCAR, thereby augmenting the ITAM signal.

**Tec family kinases in B cells and osteoclasts**

It is also conceivable that RANK activates an as yet unknown pathway that specifically synergizes with or upregulates ITAM signaling. We have shown that Tec family tyrosine kinases, such as Btk and Tec, are activated by RANK and are involved in the phosphorylation of PLCγ.²⁹ An osteopetrotic phenotype in Tec⁻/⁻Btk⁻/⁻ mice revealed these two kinases play an essential role in the regulation of osteoclast differentiation. Tec and Btk are known to have key roles in the proximal B-cell receptor signaling, as shown by the Tec⁻/⁻Btk⁻/⁻ mice in addition to the impaired antibody production and severe immunodeficiency in X-linked Bruton type agammaglobulinemia patients with a mutation in Btk. This study established a further crucial role of the Tec kinases in linking the RANK and ITAM signals and also identified an osteoclastogenic signaling complex composed of Tec kinases and scaffold proteins, which introduces a new paradigm for the signal transduction mechanism of osteoclast differentiation: ITAM phosphorylation results in the recruitment of Syk, which phosphorylates adaptor proteins, such as BLNK and SLP-76, which in turn function as scaffolds to recruit Tec kinases and PLCγ to the osteoclast signaling complex so as to induce the maximal activation of calcium influx. The revised version of the signal transduction mechanism of RANKL is summarized in Figure 2.

**Cathepsin K in TLR signaling**

Cathepsin K has been thought to be specifically expressed in osteoclasts and to play an essential role in the degradation of bone matrix, such as type I collagen. We developed a new orally active cathepsin K inhibitor and examined the effect of the inhibitor in osteoporosis as well as arthritis models. We observed the unexpected results that cathepsin K suppression leads to the reduction of inflammation in the latter model. Cathepsin K, despite being expressed at a low level in dendritic cells, plays an important role

natural killer cells, B cells, and dendritic cells (Fig. 4). Further studies are absolutely required to fully understand the osteoclast-centered osteoimmunological interactions, which include new topics, such as the transdifferentiation of dendritic cells to osteoclasts, the role of regulatory T cells in osteoclastogenesis, and the contribution of megakaryocytes to osteoclast biology.

The progress of osteoimmunology has been accelerated by analyzing mice deficient in immunomodulatory molecules. It is true that the molecules important in the immune system also play a distinct role in the skeletal system, but it is also becoming clear that molecules well known in the skeletal system play a crucial role in the immune system. These findings will lead to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of diseases affecting both systems and will provide a molecular basis for novel therapeutic strategies. Osteoimmunology has emerged as a critical new interdisciplinary field as a result of transplanting techniques, methodologies, and concepts from the field of the immune system to the field of bone biology. The knowledge obtained in the analysis of bone has clearly begun to provide unexpected information on the immune system as well.
