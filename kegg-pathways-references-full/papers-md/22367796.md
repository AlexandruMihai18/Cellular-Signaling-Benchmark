## The Neurotrophin Family of Neurotrophic Factors: An Overview

### Stephen D. Skaper

#### Abstract

The neurotrophins are a family of closely related proteins that were first identified as survival factors for sympathetic and sensory neurons and have since been shown to control a number of aspects of survival, development, and function of neurons in both the central and peripheral nervous systems. Limiting quantities of neurotrophins during development control the numbers of surviving neurons to ensure a match between neurons and the requirement for a suitable density of target innervation. Biological effects of each of the four mammalian neurotrophins are mediated through activation of one or more of the three members of the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) family of receptor tyrosine kinases (TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC). In addition, all neurotrophins activate the p75 neurotrophin receptor, a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. Neurotrophin engagement of Trk receptors leads to activation of Ras, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C-γ1, and signaling pathways controlled through these proteins, including the mitogen-activated protein kinases. Neurotrophin availability is required into adulthood, where they control synaptic function and plasticity and sustain neuronal cell survival, morphology, and differentiation. This chapter will provide an overview of neurotrophin biology, their receptors, and signaling pathways.

### 1. Introduction

Neurotrophic factors are secreted proteins that promote neurite outgrowth, neuronal cell differentiation, and survival both in vivo and in vitro. Nerve growth factor (NGF) is the founding and best characterized member of the neurotrophin family [1] of neurotrophic polypeptides and was discovered more than half a century ago [2] during a search for survival factors that could explain the deleterious effects of target tissue ablation on the subsequent survival of motor and sensory neurons [1]. NGF is also present

in the central nervous system (CNS) where it serves a trophic function in the development and maintenance of basal forebrain cholinergic neurons (3).

Neurotrophins are synthesized at a considerable distance from the cell body by peripheral tissues or neurons (“targets”) that are contacted by axons of the neurotrophin-sensitive neurons. In the periphery, the tissue sources of neurotrophins are typically non-neuronal cells, whereas in the CNS, they are synthesized predominantly by neurons under physiological conditions (4). During development, a retrograde flow of a neurotrophin is established, transporting the protein from the target into the nerve terminal and up the axon to the cell body (5). Those neurons that establish this flow survive the period of neuronal cell death, while those that do not, degenerate. Once the retrograde flow of neurotrophin is established, it must continue for the lifetime of the neuron to maintain the functional differentiated state of the neuron (6). Recent studies on the expression and actions of the neurotrophin family indicate that, in addition to target-derived factor acquisition, autocrine and non-target-derived paracrine modes of factor presentation are likely to be important (7) (see Fig. 1).

Since their initial discovery, neurotrophic factors have raised expectations that their clinical application to neurodegenerative diseases might provide an effective therapy for what are now untreatable conditions. Indeed, there is an impressive volume of evidence for neuroprotective effects of neurotrophic factors in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases (see, e.g., ref. (8)). This chapter is intended to introduce the reader to the basic concepts of neurotrophic factor biology which operate to affect nervous system function.

Fig. 1. Target-derived, autocrine, and paracrine modes of neurotrophin presentation. During the period of target innervation, neurotrophins support the survival of a restricted number of neurons expressing the appropriate tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptors. Limiting amounts of secreted neurotrophins do not allow for the survival of all neurons, which can, however, be rescued by the administration of exogenous neurotrophins.

2. Neurotrophin Biology

The generality of the phenomenon of programmed cell death after target deprivation (axotomy) has suggested that most neurons respond to and are regulated by neurotrophic factors (9). This hypothesis was validated by the subsequent isolation from pig brain of a second neurotrophic factor, designated brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) (10). Molecular cloning of the BDNF gene (11) revealed its structural similarity to NGF, leading to the concept of the neurotrophin family. Two additional members, neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4/5), were later identified (12). The term neurotrophin-4/5 resulted from uncertainties about whether the human neurotrophin-5 (13) was a species homolog of the NT-4 found in Xenopus (14). The nomenclature NT-4/5 was subsequently adopted by a number of investigators to denote the mammalian form of Xenopus NT-4 when it was shown that the differences between the two factors were only due to phylogenetic variation (15). Two novel neurotrophins from the platyfish and carp have been cloned and designated neurotrophin-6 (16) and neurotrophin-7 (17), respectively. These do not have orthologs in mammals or birds and appear to interact with the same receptors as the mammalian proteins. The neurotrophins exhibit actions on distinct, as well as partially overlapping, subsets of peripheral and central neurons (12, 18). Individual neurons may also be responsive to more than one neurotrophin at a given time or at subsequent times during development.

The mature neurotrophin proteins are noncovalently associated homodimers. The neurotrophins share a highly homologous structure and are members of a large superfamily of growth factors that contain a tertiary fold and cysteine “knot.” These features are present in transforming growth factor-β, platelet-derived growth factor, human chorionic gonadotropin, vascular endothelial growth factor, and others. The cysteine knot consists of three disulfide bonds that form a true knot of the polypeptide chain. Two cysteines that make up the knot are missing from human neurotrophin-6. Neurotrophin residues are generally divided into two categories, conserved or variable, based on sequence alignments (12). Amino acid residues implicated in neurotrophin binding that are conserved are likely to represent a common interface to the tropomyosin-related kinase (Trk) receptors, while the unique ones may represent elements of specificity (19). The dimer interface is composed of β-strands that maintain the conformation; these hydrophobic core residues are highly conserved (20–22). In contrast to the β-strands, the β-loops are highly variable. Detailed discussions of neurotrophin structure and molecular evolution have been published (23–26).

In addition to the neurotrophins, a number of polypeptide factors have been shown to possess neurotrophic activities. These include ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) (27), glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) (23), insulin-like growth factor (28), and basic fibroblast growth factor (29). Transforming growth factor-β (30) and Sonic hedgehog (31) are other proteins capable of promoting survival of specific CNS neuron populations and protecting these cells from toxic insults.

## 3. Neurotrophin Receptors

The neurotrophins interact with two entirely distinct classes of receptors, Trks and p75<sup>NTR</sup>, the first discovered member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily. The former was initially identified as a low-affinity receptor for NGF (32) but was subsequently shown to bind each of the neurotrophins with approximately equal nanomolar affinity (14, 33, 34). While p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75<sup>NTR</sup>) does not contain a catalytic motif, it interacts with several proteins that relay signals important for regulating neuronal cell survival, differentiation, and synaptic plasticity. Each of the four cysteine-rich repeats of p75<sup>NTR</sup> participates in binding to NGF (35). p75<sup>NTR</sup> binds NGF along the interface between two NGF monomers, and binding results in a conformational change in NGF that alters the monomeric interface on the opposite side of the NGF dimer, eliminating the potential for binding of one NGF dimer to two p75<sup>NTR</sup> monomers.

In mammals, the Trk subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases constitutes the second major class of neurotrophin receptors. The extracellular domain of each of the Trks consists of a cysteine-rich cluster followed by three leucine-rich repeats, another cysteine-rich cluster, and two Ig-like domains (see Fig. 2). Each receptor has a single transmembrane region that terminates in a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase-containing domain surrounded by several tyrosine residues that serve as phosphorylation-dependent docking sites for cytoplasmic adaptors and enzymes. The neurotrophins dimerize their cognate Trk receptor, resulting in activation via transphosphorylation of the cytoplasmic domain kinases. Specificity of neurotrophin action is believed to be achieved in part by the selective interaction between members of the Trk family of receptors and the different neurotrophins. Thus, NGF binds to TrkA (36, 37), TrkB binds BDNF and NT-4/5 with high affinity (38, 39), and TrkC binds NT-3 (40). NT-3 can also interact, albeit with less efficiency, with TrkA and TrkB (see Fig. 2) (15, 39).

Trk receptor function is modulated by p75<sup>NTR</sup> on several levels—by promoting ligand binding, by promoting accessibility to neurotrophins through promotion of axonal growth and target innervation,

Fig. 2. Neurotrophins and their receptors. The neurotrophins display specific interactions with the three Trk receptors: NGF binds TrkA, BDNF and NT-4 bind TrkB, and NT-3 binds TrkC. In some cellular contexts, NT-3 can also activate TrkA and TrkB, albeit with less efficiency. All neurotrophins bind to and activate p75 neurotrophin receptor ($p75^{NTR}$). CR1–CR4 cysteine-rich motifs, $C1/C2$ cysteine-rich clusters, $LRR1-3$ leucine-rich repeats, $lg1/lg2$ immunoglobulin-like domains.

and by promoting endocytosis and retrograde transport to membrane compartments where internal engagement of neurotrophins with Trk receptors may promote signaling. For example, $p75^{NTR}$ inhibits activation of Trk receptors by nonpreferred neurotrophins both in vivo and in vitro (41, 42). While $p75^{NTR}$ potentiates activation of TrkA by suboptimal concentrations of NGF, it does not potentiate the activation of other Trk receptors similarly by their ligands (43). In addition, $p75^{NTR}$ collaborates with TrkA to form high-affinity ($10^{-11}$ M) binding sites for NGF (44). Besides facilitating the binding of NGF to TrkA, $p75^{NTR}$ can promote retrograde transport of several neurotrophins (45). $p75^{NTR}$ may reduce ligand-induced Trk receptor ubiquitination, thereby delaying Trk internalization and degradation (46), or promote Trk receptor endocytosis through polyubiquitination and subsequent internalization to endosomal compartments, resulting in enhanced signaling (47). These findings each suggest a mechanism by which $p75^{NTR}$ may promote axon growth and target innervation in vivo and in vitro (48, 49). Sensory and sympathetic deficits are seen in mice lacking $p75^{NTR}$ (50–52).

The major site at which neurotrophins interact with the Trk receptors is in the membrane-proximal Ig-like domain. The three-dimensional structures of the domain in each of the Trk receptors have been solved (53). In addition, the structure of NGF bound to the TrkA Ig domain has also been determined (19). These results have made it possible to identify residues in the neurotrophins and
the Trk receptors that account for the specificity observed in their interactions (54). Such information may prove useful in the design of small molecule mimetic ligands for neurotrophin receptors.

# 4. Neurotrophin Signaling

Many extracellular signals transduce their cellular responses by regulating tyrosine phosphorylation of their target proteins. Ligand-induced oligomerization of receptor protein tyrosine kinases and autophosphorylation have been established as a general mechanism for the activation of growth factor receptors, as well as many other families of cell surface receptors (55). The Trk receptors are typical receptor tyrosine kinases whose activation is stimulated by neurotrophin-mediated dimerization and transphosphorylation of activation loop kinases (56). Trk receptors are activated specifically by the mature and not the pro-forms of the neurotrophin gene products (57). Thus, the proteases that control processing of proneurotrophins control Trk receptor responsiveness. The cytoplasmic domains of the Trk receptors contain several additional tyrosines that are also substrates for phosphorylation by each receptor's tyrosine kinase. When phosphorylated, these residues form the cores of binding sites that serve as a scaffolding for the recruitment of a variety of adaptor proteins and enzymes that ultimately propagate the neurotrophin signal (58). Within the activated Trk molecule, the phosphotyrosines and their surrounding amino acid residues create binding sites for proteins containing phosphotyrosine-binding or Src homology 2 domains. The major pathways activated by the Trk receptors are Ras, Rac, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, phospholipase C-$\gamma$1, and their downstream effectors (56, 58). In addition, endocytosis and transfer of Trk receptors to different membrane compartments control the efficiency and duration of Trk-mediated signaling in part because many adaptor proteins are localized to specific membrane compartments (59). Activation of p75${}^{\mathrm{NTR}}$ results in activation of the nuclear factor-$\kappa$B and Jun kinase, as well as other signaling pathways (see Fig. 3).

Transactivation of receptor tyrosine kinases by G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is now recognized as an important signaling mechanism allowing the cell to respond to a vast array of extracellular stimuli (60, 61). Activation of TrkA and TrkB receptors can also occur via a GPCR mechanism, in the absence of NGF or BDNF (62, 63). Two GPCR ligands, adenosine and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide, can activate Trk receptor activity to increase the survival of neuronal cells through stimulation of protein kinase B (Akt) activity. The effects of adenosine and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating peptide can be blocked by K252a, an inhibitor of Trk tyrosine kinases. In contrast to

Fig. 3. Neurotrophin signaling. Depicted are interactions of NGF (exemplar neurotrophin) with Trk and major intracellular signaling pathways activated. Neurotrophin binding to Trk receptor leads to dimerization and autophosphorylation. The linker Shc binds to phospho-Y490 on Trk and to a Grb2-SOS complex. SOS is a nucleotide exchange factor that activates Ras by replacing GDP with GTP. Activated Ras interacts directly with the serine–threonine kinase Raf. The activated Raf leads to the sequential activation of MAPK kinase (MEK), the mitogen-activated protein kinase-ERK kinase (MAPK). MAPK translocates to the nucleus, where it phosphorylates transcription factors, promoting neuronal cell differentiation. Activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase through Ras or Gab1 promotes survival and growth of neurons. Activation of phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) results in activation of Ca²⁺- and protein kinase C-regulated pathways that promote synaptic plasticity.

neurotrophin treatment, Trk receptor activation by adenosine analogs and pituitary adenylate cyclase–activating peptide is sensitive to transcriptional and translational inhibitors, with the majority of the transactivated Trk receptors found in intracellular membranes, suggesting that receptor signaling may occur and persist inside of neuronal cells (64). More recent studies indicate that the tyrosine kinase Fyn is activated by GPCR stimulation and is responsible for transactivation of Trk receptors on intracellular membranes (65).

Several excellent reviews describe recent progress in understanding the signaling pathways stimulated by the neurotrophins that affect the survival, differentiation, and function of cell within the nervous system (66–69).

### 5. Why Study Neurotrophins?

The power of neurotrophic factors to regulate neuronal cell survival in the developing nervous system and to promote also survival after injury or protect neurons in toxin-mediated disease models in
animals has encouraged the idea that such proteins could be harnessed for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease. For example, the traditional perspective of applying neurotrophins in the context of Alzheimer’s disease is based on the premise that neurotrophins are capable of upregulating cholinergic function and of rendering neurons less vulnerable to certain processes causing degeneration (70, 71). Another example is that of GDNF, which acts on dopaminergic neurons. Administered intracerebrally, GDNF has neuroprotective and neurorestorative effects in toxin-induced rodent and nonhuman primate models of Parkinson’s disease (72, 73). Neurotrophic factor treatment of CNS diseases presents an especially complex problem since these polypeptides have poor pharmacokinetics and bioavailability and are not able to cross the blood–brain barrier. Neurotrophic proteins can be modified to increase blood–brain barrier transport (74), and intravenous administration of BDNF, conjugated to an anti-transferrin antibody, is able to traverse the blood–brain barrier in rats and provide neuroprotection in focal transient brain ischemia (75, 76). Viral vector or cell-based gene therapy approaches may also prove advantageous for the targeted delivery of lower doses of neurotrophic factors, and dopaminergic neuroprotection by viral-mediated delivery of GDNF has been demonstrated in animals (72, 77). In the case of spinal cord injury, the transplantation of genetically modified cells (e.g., viral expression of neurotrophins either in vivo or ex vivo in stem cells) to lesion sites has been investigated as a means to augment axonal regeneration (78, 79). A cell-based approach for NGF delivery has shown promise in a phase I trial in Alzheimer’s disease (80). In the case of CNTF, a fusion protein consisting of mature human CNTF and an 11-amino acid protein transduction domain rescued the learning and memory impairments induced by amyloid β-peptide in mice (81), as did infusion of recombinant cells secreting CNTF encapsulated in alginate polymers (82).

Peripheral nervous system disorders should also be amenable to a neurotrophic protein therapeutic. NGF, which is selectively trophic for small fiber sensory and sympathetic neurons, was selected as a potential therapy for diabetic polyneuropathy because of the serious consequences associated with degeneration of those neuronal populations in this condition. In addition, a reduced NGF availability may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetic neuropathy (83), and animal models of neuropathy respond to the exogenous administration of NGF (84). Two sets of phase II clinical trials suggested that recombinant human NGF administration was effective in ameliorating the symptoms associated with both diabetic polyneuropathy (85) and human immunodeficiency virus–related neuropathy (86). Clinical trials are continuing in this direction.
Clearly, methodologies which are directed to understanding neurotrophic protein-receptor interactions, biological activities, and neuroprotective/neurorestorative effects are of great importance in advancing this critical area of neuroscience. The protocols detailed in this volume have been written with this goal in mind.
