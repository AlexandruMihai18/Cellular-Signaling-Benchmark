### Abstract

Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of adult dementia. Its pathological hallmarks are synaptic degeneration, deposition of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles, leading to neuronal loss. A few hypotheses have been proposed to explain AD pathogenesis. The beta-amyloid (Aβ) and hyperphosphorylated tau hypotheses suggest that these proteins are the main players in AD development. Another hypothesis proposes that the dysregulation of calcium homeostasis may be a key factor in accelerating other pathological changes. Although Aβ and tau have been extensively studied, recently published data provide a growing body of evidence supporting the critical role of calcium signalling in AD. For example, presenilins, which are mutated in familial cases of AD, were demonstrated to form low conductance calcium channels in the ER and elevated cytosolic calcium concentration increases amyloid generation. Moreover, memantine, an antagonist of the NMDA-calcium channel receptor, has been found to have a beneficial effect for AD patients offering novel possibilities for a calcium signalling targeted therapy of AD. This review underscores the growing importance of calcium ions in AD development and focuses on the relevant aspects of calcium homeostasis.

The neuropathological hallmarks of AD include a progressive loss of neurons, synaptic degeneration, and a deposition of amyloid plaques and of neurofibrillary tangles in characteristic brain regions. There are reports indicating that AD could be a systemic disease since not only neurons are affected in AD patients, but also peripheral cells such as fibroblasts, lymphocytes and platelets (Baskin et al., 2001; Eckert et al., 2001; Evin et al., 2003; Lanni et al., 2007; Leissring et al., 1999a; Mattson, 2004; Sulger et al., 1999; Urcelay et al., 2001).

Age is the main risk factor of AD; but an early onset of the disease (before the age of 65) has been observed in a small percentage of AD patients. In most of these cases, the disease has a genetic basis. Polymorphisms, increasing risk of AD, have been identified in the genes for apolipoproteins and for sortilin 1 (Cedazo-Minguez and Cowburn, 2001; Rogaeva et al., 2007). Dominantly inherited mutations in presenilins (PS1 and PS2) and in their substrate, the amyloid precursor protein (APP), are the primary cause of familial Alzheimer’s disease (FAD) (Hardy and Gwinn-Hardy, 1998). Presenilins are integral components of a multiprotein protease complex, called γ-secretase, which is responsible for the intramembrane cleavage of APP, of Notch receptors (De Strooper et al., 1999, 1998) and of several other type-I membrane proteins (Marambaud and Robakis, 2005).

The etiology of Alzheimer’s disease is unknown, but there are a few major theories in this matter, reviewed in Carter and Lippa (2001), LaFerla (2002), Layfield (2001), and Zekanowski et al. (2004). Two of these are amyloid hypothesis and hyperphosphorylated tau hypothesis. They consider these proteins as the inducers of the disease. It is not fully established, however, whether tau and amyloid related alterations are the real causes or hallmarks of AD.

The third hypothesis, which has retained our attention, claims that dysregulation of calcium homeostasis plays a central role in AD pathogenesis (Mattson, 2004; Smith et al., 2005; Stutzmann, 2005). In this review we focus on the possible role of alterations in calcium homeostasis in the pathogenesis and course of AD.

## Intracellular calcium homeostasis

The calcium hypothesis was first proposed by Khachaturian, who postulated that sustained intracellular calcium disturbances are the proximal causes of neurodegenerative disorders, including AD (Khachaturian, 1994). This theory was supported by experimental studies which showed alterations in calcium signalling both in sporadic and in familial cases of AD (Etcheberrigaray et al., 1998; Ito et al., 1994), reviewed in LaFerla (2002).

A variety of neuronal functions depend on calcium signalling, which, in turn, is tightly regulated in time, space and intensity, reviewed in Stutzmann (2005). Calcium signals are modulated by a calcium influx from the extracellular environment or calcium release from intracellular stores in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). At rest, the level of calcium ions in the cytosol is relatively low (between 50 and 300 nM), but after activation their concentration increases to several micromoles (LaFerla, 2002). In contrast, the level of calcium in the ER is approximately 1000 times higher than in the cytosol of the resting cell. Such a tremendous concentration gradient can be attributed to the activity of sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA) pumps that actively transport Ca²⁺ from cytosol to the lumen of ER.

After activation (electric, synaptic, or receptor-mediated), calcium is liberated from the ER via two kinds of channels localized in the ER membrane, namely the inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP₃R) and the ryanodine receptors (RyR). Release through RyR is activated by a slight increase in cytosolic calcium levels while liberation through IP₃R requires inositol-1,4,5-triphosphate (IP₃). IP₃ is generated from phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate by phospholipase C, which is induced by a G-protein that, in turn, requires activation of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) in the plasma membrane. The dynamics, amplitude, and decay of a calcium efflux from the ER create a specific pattern of calcium signalling (Berridge et al., 2000). The depletion of ER calcium stores triggers Ca²⁺ influx to the cytosol through the so-called store-operated calcium channels localized in the plasma membrane. The intracellular calcium stores in the ER are then replenished by the activity of SERCA pumps. This refilling mechanism is termed capacitative calcium entry (CCE), reviewed in Putney (2003).

## APP metabolism

The amyloid hypothesis assumes that the accumulation of beta-amyloid (Aβ) in the brain is the primary cause of AD (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002). The deposition of this highly insoluble peptide results from its overproduction and altered processing of amyloid precursor protein. As some Aβ is detected in healthy brains during post-mortem analysis, suggesting that it is a result of physiological event, accumulation of Aβ in AD tissue may be caused by its impaired clearance.

APP is a type I membrane protein with the sequence of Aβ partly embedded in the plasma membrane. The processing of APP takes place according to the general pattern of regulated intramembrane proteolysis (Steiner and Haass, 2000). It undergoes two subsequent proteolytic steps that can either preclude or cause Aβ generation.

In the first step, the extracellular part of APP is shed from the cell surface, either by α-secretase or by β-secretase (generating, respectively sAPPα or sAPPβ). The activity of α-secretase on APP precludes Aβ liberation, as its cleavage site is localized within the amyloid sequence, and results in the generation of a non-amyloidogenic carboxy-terminal fragment of APP (C83). Two members of the ADAM family (desintegrin and metalloproteinase): ADAM-10 and ADAM-17 (or TACE) have been shown to display α-secretase activity (Buxbaum et al., 1998b; Lammich et al., 1999). The cleavage of APP by β-secretase generates an extracellular soluble amino terminal part of the protein as well as an amyloidogenic carboxy-terminalfragment (C99). β-secretase (β-site APP cleaving enzyme, BACE) was identified as an aspartyl protease and a type I membrane protein (Hussain et al., 1999; Sinha et al., 1999; Vassar et al., 1999).

The second step of APP processing is catalysed by γ-secretase which is a multimeric protein complex consisting of PS1 or PS2, aph-1, nicastrin and pen-2 (De Strooper et al., 1998; Francis et al., 2002; Levitan et al., 2001; Steiner et al., 2002). The unique feature of the γ-secretase complex is that it is active within a lipid bilayer, where it cleaves both C83 and C99. The processing of C83 generates a non-amyloidogenic P3 peptide. The cleavage of C99 occurs first at the ε-site and liberates the APP carboxy-terminal intracellular domain (AICD). This is followed by a cut of membrane remaining fragment at the γ-site and the release of 40 or 42 amino acid residues long Aβ.

Intracellular trafficking of APP plays a key role in the regulation of Aβ generation. Rogaeva et al. searched for genetic polymorphisms of the neuronal sorting receptor (SORL1), involved in APP recycling from cell surface via the endocytic pathway (Rogaeva et al., 2007). The authors identified inherited variants of SORL1 associated with increased susceptibility to AD. This finding corroborates the study by Andersen et al., which showed a decreased expression of Sorl1 protein in the brain of AD patients that correlates with an increased Aβ production (Andersen et al., 2005).

The physiological role of APP remains unclear. APP binds to the kinesin light chain subunit, kinesin-I, thus it is postulated to be involved in the axonal transport in neurons (Kamal et al., 2000; Stokin and Goldstein, 2006). It is also likely that APP functions as a modulator of intracellular signal transduction. Indeed, APP was demonstrated to interact with brain G protein G₀. Moreover, FAD mutations in APP led to the permanent activation of G₀ linked receptors (Karelson et al., 2005; Nishimoto et al., 1993; Okamoto et al., 1996; Swanson et al., 2005).

The relation of APP processing to calcium homeostasis should be discussed in the context of the following mutual relationship: (1) the role of APP, its proteolytic fragments and presenilins in calcium signalling and (2) the influence of Ca²⁺ related pathways on APP metabolism. It is this bidirectional relationship of APP processing and calcium homeostasis that makes the pathogenesis of AD difficult to resolve.

the AICD sequence. These results indicated a tight link between γ-secretase activity and calcium homeostasis alterations (Leissring et al., 2002). This function of AICD may be linked to its properties as a co-regulator of gene expression. It was shown to migrate to the nucleus and interact with the adapter protein Fe65 and the histone acetyltransferase Tip60, potent transcription stimulators (Cao and Sudhof, 2001; Gao and Pimplikar, 2001; Kinoshita et al., 2002).

The extracellular amino-terminal domain of APP (called sAPP) was shown to exhibit neuroprotective properties. It protects hippocampal neurons from glutamate driven excitotoxicity by attenuating calcium response (Mattson, 1994b; Mattson et al., 1993). sAPP also displays a cell-protective effect mediated by the stabilization of intracellular calcium in cells bearing pro-apoptotic mutant of PS1 (Guo et al., 1998b).

In turn, aggregates of Aβ disrupt calcium signalling (Mattson et al., 1992). When added to the media of cultured cells, Aβ was shown to increase cytosolic calcium concentrations (Goodman and Mattson, 1994; Mattson et al., 1993). Such an alteration in precisely regulated calcium metabolism may cause a variety of secondary effects, i.e. the activation of cellular enzymes, the induction of apoptosis and the modification of cytoskeleton (Mattson, 1994a; Mattson et al., 1991). It was indicated that Aβ triggers calcium release from ER stores mediated both by IP₃ and ryanodine receptors (Ferreiro et al., 2004). Moreover, an elevated protein expression and the function of RyR in Aβ stimulated mouse cortical neurons were described (Supnet et al., 2006). Cytosolic calcium concentration can be additionally increased by the formation of cation-selective ion channels by Aβ. Proteins such as amylin and the prion protein peptide 106–126, which similarly to Aβ adopt β-sheet structure, were shown to form calcium pores (Mirzabekov et al., 1996). This property of Aβ is well documented and has been extensively studied both in artificial membrane systems as well as in living cells (Arispe et al., 1993; Kagan et al., 2004). Another mechanism by which Aβ disrupts intracellular calcium homeostasis is related to its ability to form reactive oxygen species that may induce membrane lipid peroxidation (Hensley et al., 1994). This causes alterations in membrane properties and affects the function of membrane transporters and ion channels leading to an elevation of intracellular calcium levels (Keller et al., 1997).

Before it assumes its insoluble fibrillar conformation, Aβ aggregates through several states including dimers, oligomers (consisting of 10–24 monomers) and strings of oligomers (protofibrills) (Glabe, 2004). For many years, Alzheimer’s disease was attributed to neuronal cell loss induced only by deposits of fibrillar Aβ. However, as soon as studies on the pathogenic effects of Aβ species in different aggregation states were undertaken, a new hypothesis emerged. It postulated that the early memory and cognitive functions deficits are caused by a synapse failure induced by soluble oligomers (Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Klein et al., 2001). It is based on the observation that Aβ oligomers alter synaptic plasticity, as revealed by completely diminished LTP both in vivo and in cultured neurons (Lambert et al., 1998; Townsend et al., 2006; Walsh et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2002). Evidence was provided for a

## 4. APP processing and calcium homeostasis

The discovery of APP processing initiated a quest for the functional relevance of its fragments, which revealed that practically each product of APP metabolism interacts with a calcium signalosome, reviewed in LaFerla (2002). La Ferla and colleagues indicated a decreased release of calcium from the intracellular stores in APP –/– cells (Leissring et al., 2002). A similar effect was observed in fibroblasts derived from presenilin knockout mice and wild type cells treated with several γ-secretase inhibitors. Disturbances in calcium signalling in APP –/– cells were rescued only by an overexpression of AICD-containing APP fragments and not by those lacking
direct interaction of Aβ oligomers with synapses indicating their colocalization with the synaptic marker PSD-95 protein (Lacor et al., 2004). The toxic effect of Aβ oligomers on brain cells is complex. These oligomers have been shown to rapidly elevate intracellular calcium levels in human neuroblastoma cells and increase general membrane permeability and membrane conductance (Demuro et al., 2005; Sokolov et al., 2006). Soluble Aβ oligomers were indicated to affect the surface expression of NMDA receptors. Greengard’s group observed enhanced NMDA receptor endocytosis in cortical neurons treated with Aβ oligomers (Snyder et al., 2005). Similarly, neurons from transgenic animals overproducing Aβ (APPsw transgene) expressed lower surface levels of NMDA. The same authors proved that the Aβ binds to the α-7 nicotinic receptor and activates protein phosphatase 2B. This, in turn, activates STEM, a tyrosine kinase, which phosphorylates the NMDA receptor what leads to increased rate of NMDA receptor endocytosis. Oligomers are also the strongest inducers of oxidative stress among all Aβ species (Tamagno et al., 2006). Generation of free radicals, altered membrane properties as well as disturbed calcium homeostasis may underlie the apoptotic effect of Aβ oligomers (Deshpande et al., 2006; Malaplate-Armand et al., 2006).

### 5. Effects of calcium on APP metabolism

The influence of calcium on APP processing is not as thoroughly studied as the role of APP in calcium signalling. Nevertheless, several lines of evidence indicate that an elevated cytosolic calcium concentration increases Aβ production. It was indicated that calcium influx through calcium channels of the plasma membrane, or calcium release from ER stores, increases Aβ generation (Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994). These results were confirmed in recent studies by Pierrot et al., who demonstrated that an increase in the cytosolic calcium concentration induces transient phosphorylation of APP and tau, leading to an increased production of intracellular Aβ (Pierrot et al., 2004, 2006). However, earlier reports in which cells were differently treated to increase cytosolic calcium levels contradict these findings, i.e. Buxbaum et al. indicated that the inhibition of SERCA pumps with thapsigargin diminished Aβ generation in dose-dependent manner (Buxbaum et al., 1994). In turn, Landman et al. reported enhanced Aβ1-42 production in PS1 FAD cells in which calcium entry through the transient receptor potential melastatin 7 (TRPM7)-associated Mg²⁺-inhibited cation (MIC) channel was reduced (Landman et al., 2006). MIC function is modulated by phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂). The PS1 FAD mutant has been shown to decrease the level of cellular PIP₂. The authors observed an inverted correlation of PIP₂ levels with amounts of generated Aβ1-42. Though the exact mechanism of modulation of γ-secretase activity by PIP₂ still has to be elucidated, this study suggests a new potential approach to modulate Aβ production.

Altered APP processing, dependent on activity of plasma membrane calcium transporters has also been reported by Yoo et al., who showed an increased Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 production ratio after the attenuation of capacitative calcium entry in PS1 FAD cells (Yoo et al., 2000). The relationship between CCE and AD pathogenesis will be described in more detail in the following section.

### 6. Presenilins and calcium homeostasis

Presenilins are multispanning, polytopic membrane proteins which display a variety of functions (Cedazo-Minguez et al., 2002; Dewji et al., 2004; Marjaux et al., 2004). In addition to being a component of the γ-secretase complex, PS1 has been identified as an element of intercellular junctions together with E-cadherin and β-catenin (Georgakopoulos et al., 1999). PS1 was also shown to mediate intercellular contacts, act as a scaffold protein for kinases and their substrates and play a role in autophagocytosis (Annaert et al., 2001; Dewji et al., 2004; Doglio et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2002). FAD mutations, identified in PS1 and PS2, lead to alterations in APP processing which result in an increased Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 production ratio and in pathological aggregation of β-amyloid in senile plaques, both of which are hallmarks of AD, reviewed in Tandon et al. (2000) and Zekanowski et al. (2003).

Mutations in presenilins contribute to less than 10% of all AD cases (Selkoe, 2004). In spite of that, familial Alzheimer’s disease is widely accepted as the best available model for studies on AD pathogenesis. Although there is no direct evidence that a calcium regulating action of presenilins is involved in sporadic forms of AD, a variety of experimental setups showed that presenilins FAD mutations disrupt intracellular calcium signalling, reviewed in LaFerla (2002) and Stutzmann (2005) (Table 1). This was also shown in cells obtained from presymptomatic family members of examined FAD patients who subsequently developed AD, indicating that calcium disturbances long precedes the onset of other AD symptoms (Etcheberrigaray et al., 1998). The best known manifestation of alterations in calcium homeostasis caused by presenilins FAD mutations is the overload of ER calcium stores that results in enhanced calcium release after cell stimulation. Such an enhanced ER calcium release in PS1 and PS2 FAD cells was shown for treatments with both IP₃ and RyR receptor agonists in a variety of cell lines, tissues and transgenic animals (Chui et al., 1999; Etcheberrigaray et al., 1998; Guo et al., 1996; Leissring et al., 1999b). The overload of calcium stores was correlated with the increase of susceptibility of cells to apoptosis. The treatment of PS FAD cells with pharmacological inhibitors of ER calcium channels protects cells from pro-apoptotic agents, including Aβ (Cedazo-Minguez et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2000). The mechanism leading to the overload of ER calcium stores in PS mutants remains unclear. However, a new light on this issue has been shed by the recent findings that wild type PS, but neither PS1 nor PS2 FAD mutants, can form low-conductance divalent-cation-permeable ion channels in lipid bilayers (Tu et al., 2006). This suggests that mutations in PS1 and PS2 genes cause loss of the normal ER calcium leak current mediated by presenilin “leak channels” what results in the elevation of luminal calcium concentration. One may expect that, if presenilins form calcium channels in ER, which

provide physiological calcium concentration by constant moderate calcium efflux to cytosol, presenilin knockout should result in ER calcium stores overload. Indeed, Bezprozvany's group indicated that the calcium level in the ER lumen is higher in presenilin double knockout (DKO) cells (lacking both PS1 and PS2) than in wild type, as measured by the Mag-Fura-2 dye (Tu et al., 2006). Moreover, normal luminal calcium concentration was rescued by an overexpression of wild type PS1 but not of FAD mutants. However, these results contradict those of Kasri et al. who show that ER calcium content in DKO cells assayed with ER targeted aequorin is decreased (Kasri et al., 2006). In the same cells the four-fold increase of IP₃R expression in the R1 subtype correlated with the enhanced calcium leak from the ER. Moreover, decreased levels of calcium ions in the ER and Golgi apparatus were reported recently for several PS1 and PS2 FAD mutants by Pizzo's group, questioning previously published data on ER calcium overload in PS FAD mutant cells (Zatti et al., 2006). These authors applied both fura-2 and aequorin to measure ER calcium concentration in three different cell lines and the results obtained with those techniques were consistent. Hence, the authors argued that the discrepancy of their findings with previously published data results neither from the technique nor model system used. Instead, they pointed out the necessity of careful selection of age-matched controls and concluded that the increase in ER calcium release observed by others may result from ER independent function of mutated presenilins (i.e. modulation of IP₃ level) and not from the store overload itself (Zatti et al., 2006).

Overexpression of IP₃R1 described by Kasri et al. is not the only case of presenilin related alteration in the ER calcium channels protein level. Chan et al. indicated interaction between PS1 and RyR and reported increased level of the latter in cortical neurons and the PC12 cell line harboring PS1 FAD mutants (Chan et al., 2000). Moreover, in such cells ER calcium stores were overfilled as calcium release from RyR-dependent stores was enhanced. Such an enhanced expression of RyR was also observed in mice neurons expressing PS1 FAD mutation (Stutzmann et al., 2006).

The most direct consequence of ER calcium stores overfill is the attenuation of capacitative calcium entry in PS1 FAD cells as their calcium stores do not require replenishing as much as those of normal cells. This feature of PS1 FAD mutants is documented in a variety of point mutations (Leissring et al., 2000a; Yoo et al., 2000). The attenuation of CCE is a direct effect of PS1 mutants and is independent from APP metabolism as it was shown in APP knockout cells (Herms et al., 2003). On the other hand, the PS1-driven inhibition of CCE influences APP processing leading to the increase of Aβ1-42 generation (Yoo et al., 2000). The store-operated channels (SOCs) localized in the plasma membrane are responsible for cell calcium refilling via CCE. The coupling mechanism between ER calcium stores and SOCs in the plasma membrane as well as the identity and nature of these ion transporters have remained unknown for a long time. The recent discovery of the involvement of STIM1 and Orai proteins in CCE shed new light on this issue. STIM1 is a type I ER membrane protein

containing an unpaired EF-hand motif which acts as a calcium sensor in the ER lumen. STIM1 directly transduces information on ER calcium level to the plasma membrane. Orai 1 resides in the plasma membrane and functions as a calcium channel gated by a signal received from STIM1, reviewed in (Hewavitharana et al., 2007). The discovery of this calcium store-operated signalling pathway opens up a new perspective for studies on possible alterations in STIM1 and Orai1 function in AD.

### 7. AD related calcium dyshomeostasis independent of APP processing

Several studies describe that pathogenesis of AD is frequently accompanied by changes in the expression levels of calcium-buffer and calcium-sensor proteins (Braunewell and Gundelfinger, 1999). It still remains elusive whether these alterations are secondary to neurodegeneration or whether they underlay the pathogenesis of the disease.

Some calcium binding proteins bind directly to presenilins. Among these are RyR, its modulator – sorcin, μ-calpain and calmyrin – a myristolated protein suspected to trigger calcium signals to membrane proteins (Blazejczyk et al., 2006; Chan et al., 2000; Pack-Chung et al., 2000; Shinozaki et al., 1998; Stabler et al., 1999). However, the mutual regulation of activities of presenilins and their calcium binding partners is still unclear.

It was shown that the level of calcium buffering protein –28 kDa calbindin D is decreased in brain areas which are known to be particularly affected in aging and neurodegenerative diseases (Iacopino and Christakos, 1990). This suggests that decreased expression of 28 kDa calbindin D may affect the buffering of intraneuronal calcium, which in turn, leads to calcium-mediated cytotoxic effects during aging and neurodegeneration. This view is strengthened by the observation that overexpressed 28 kDa calbindin D reduces Aβ induced intracellular calcium increase and blocks elevated calcium response in PS1 FAD cells (Guo et al., 1998a). A similar effect of calcium release attenuation has been observed for calsenilin – a calcium binding protein which interacts both with PS1 and PS2 (Buxbaum et al., 1998a; Leissring et al., 2000b).

Alterations in neuronal calcium homeostasis have also been related to lipid metabolism. Apolipoproteins are responsible for transporting cholesterol from the blood into cells. Individuals homozygous for apolipoprotein E (ApoE4) have an increased risk for AD in comparison to those with one or both of the other two isoforms (E2 and E3) (Cedazo-Minguez and Cowburn, 2001). Tolar et al. demonstrated a neurotoxic effect of ApoE fragment, mediated by calcium influx through NMDA receptor channels (Tolar et al., 1999). Moreover, it was reported that the receptor-binding domain of ApoE is capable of stimulating ER calcium release and extracellular calcium influx (Wang and Gruenstein, 1997). Collectively, the emerging data suggest a growing importance of ApoE in the crosstalk between lipid and calcium metabolism in AD.

Age is the principal risk factor in AD and one of the molecular hypotheses of ageing claims dysregulation of calcium homeostasis in aged brains, reviewed in Thibault et al. (2007). Recently, increased levels of basal calcium ions, even in mid-aged neurons in comparison to young control cells (Raza et al., 2007), and increased activity of L-type voltage gated calcium channels (L-VGCC) in aged hippocampal neurons were reported (Thibault and Landfield, 1996). Such enhancement in calcium influx by L-VGCCs may increase the susceptibility of aged neurons to apoptosis. This hypothesis is supported by recent findings of Fu et al., who showed that bis(7)-tacrine, a dimeric inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, attenuates Aβ-induced neuronal apoptosis by regulation of L-VGCCs action (Fu et al., 2006).

The progressive decline in mitochondrial function is another hallmark of aging. Mitochondria are the principal cellular generators of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and their dysfunction leads to an age-related accumulation of oxidative damage. Indeed, a defect in mitochondrial complex IV (cytochrome C oxidase) was shown to be associated with AD (Sheehan et al., 1997). As the consequence of mitochondrial dysfunction, elevation of cytosolic calcium levels and a delay in its recovery to baseline after IP₃R stimulation was observed in cybrids bearing mitochondria from AD patients. Moreover, an increase of more than 30% in basal ROS was measured in such cells. Similar observations were reported by Cardoso et al., who reported significantly reduced ATP levels in cybrids with mitochondria from AD patients (Cardoso et al., 2004). Such energy depletion may possibly alter the cellular calcium homeostasis in various ways. For example, reduced cellular ATP levels result in an increase of the free calcium levels in the cytosol (Hamid et al., 2007) possibly due to a reduced function of the ATP-dependent SERCA pump. Moreover, the ability of mitochondria to buffer cytosolic calcium overload is in part ATP-dependent (Rizzuto et al., 2004). The direct role of mitochondria in the refilling of intracellular calcium stores has been proposed (Arnaudeau et al., 2001). These authors reported localization of this organelle close to the sites of calcium release from the ER and indicated that mitochondria recycle portions of released Ca²⁺ back to ER domains.

### 8. Calcium-dependent tau phosphorylation

The hyperphosphorylation of the microtubule associated protein tau leads to the formation of neurofibrillary tangles and neuronal loss which are hallmarks of AD. The state of tau phosphorylation is tightly regulated and seems to be calcium-dependent. GSK3β and a bulk of other kinases are involved in tau phosphorylation (Johnson and Stootohoff, 2004). Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II phosphorylates tau at the site of its interaction with microtubules (Litersky et al., 1996).

In turn, the calcium-dependent protease calpain generates p25 protein from p35 precursor; it should be noted that p25 is a strong activator of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5), which is known to play a role in tau hyperphosphorylation (Maccioni et al., 2001). On the other hand, the involvement of the calcium/calmodulin-dependent phosphatase, calcineurin in tau depho-

sphorylation has been shown (Fleming and Johnson, 1995). A recent study indicates that membrane depolarization of cultured neurons induced a calcium-mediated transient phosphorylation of tau, followed by a dephosphorylation of this protein (Pierrot et al., 2006). While phosphorylation was mediated by GSK3β and Cdk5 kinases, calcineurin was responsible for dephosphorylation. This clearly demonstrates calcium-dependent regulation of tau phosphorylation status. Enhanced tau phosphorylation by GSK3β was also observed in the brains of PS1 FAD transgenic mice in contrast to PS1 knockout animals (Dewachter et al., 2007).

### 9. Conclusions and perspectives

Calcium ions play several roles in processes which are crucial for the functioning of a neuronal cell including membrane excitability and gene expression. Though disturbances in calcium homeostasis in cells from AD patients have been observed for many years, much more attention was focused on Aβ and tau as key causative factors for the disease. Nevertheless, there is accumulating evidence pointing to the importance of disturbed calcium signalling in AD pathogenesis.

Since it is well established that both Aβ and tau are neurotoxic and that their accumulation seems to be the main reason for neuronal loss in the brain of demented patients, the question arises as to whether these aggregates or alterations in calcium homeostasis are the primary cause, the effect, or maybe byproducts in the pathogenesis of AD. There is a wealth of evidence that cognitive decline occurs prior to neuronal loss during the progress of the disease and it correlates with the accumulation of intraneuronal Aβ (Selkoe, 2002). It clearly indicates that neuronal dysfunction, not death, is the primary event in Alzheimer’s dementia. Alteration in the precisely regulated calcium homeostasis is one of the known causes of neuronal malfunction. Proper calcium signalling is of the most crucial importance for synaptogenesis and dendritic spines plasticity. Cognitive decline and neurodegeneration of synapses are the first symptoms of AD (Hsieh et al., 2006; Oertner and Matus, 2005; Redmond and Ghosh, 2005). Moreover, FAD mutations in presenilins, which are proven to enhance calcium release from ER calcium stores, were recently demonstrated to alter synaptic transmission in hippocampal neurons (Priller et al., 2007). Increased cytosolic calcium concentrations in PS FAD mutations harboring cells, enhances production of intracellular and extracellular Aβ (Pierrot et al., 2004; Querfurth and Selkoe, 1994). In turn, both fibrillar Aβ and Aβ oligomers, although acting on neurons in different manners, have a similar effect, namely a sustained increase in cytosolic calcium concentration. These observations strongly suggest the existence of a positive feedback loop between Aβ generation and an elevated level of calcium ions in the cytosol (Fig. 1). Such mutual stimulation can greatly contribute to a rapid progress of pathological changes. Pharmacological treatment, aimed at breaking this positive feedback loop, i.e. by attenuating elevated calcium signalling, could be beneficial for patients suffering from AD. Indeed, memantine, a noncompetitive antagonist of NMDA calcium channel receptor predominantly localized at dendritic spines, belongs to the group of very few drugs that have been proven to be of some benefit to AD patients (Peskind et al., 2006; Tariot et al., 2004). However, this treatment is targeted only at plasma membrane calcium channels and does not regulate ER calcium stores which are mainly affected in AD. Thus, this may be a plausible explanation for the merely temporary benefit of memantine.

Since dysregulation in calcium homeostasis is observed long before the onset of the first symptoms of the disease, it offers novel possibilities for its diagnosis and treatment. Moreover, alterations in calcium signalling are not restricted to neuronal cells. They have been also reported for peripheral cells such as fibroblasts and lymphocytes which represent easy to obtain

**Fig. 1. Postulated relationship between calcium homeostasis and AD related proteins. The processing of APP results in the release of Aβ which enhances calcium ion influx into the cell by the formation of cation channels and by an increase in membrane permeability induced by reactive oxygen species. Calcium ions are released from ER stores through IP₃ and ryanodine receptors (RyR). Presenilins (PS), acting as “leak channels”, provide sustained moderate, γ-secretase independent calcium efflux to cytosol. Elevated cytosolic calcium level enhances Aβ generation and tau hyperphosphorylation. The intracellular domain of APP (AICD) migrates to the nucleus and interacts with transcription regulators.**

diagnostic material (Eckert et al., 2001; Li et al., 2006; Urcelay et al., 2001). However, designing a specific and sensitive diagnostic test, as well as effective treatment, requires better understanding of the role of calcium ions in AD pathogenesis. Still, much work has to be done to elucidate conflicting results obtained in different experimental setups. For example, Tu et al. indicated a higher calcium level in the ER lumen of presenilin double knockout cells compared to the wild type and attributed this to the altered function of presenilin calcium channels in the ER membrane (Tu et al., 2006). On the other hand, Kasri et al., using another experimental approach, reported decreased ER calcium content in the same type of cells (Kasri et al., 2006). Proper understanding of the complex nature of calcium signalling requires careful evaluation of the advantages and drawbacks of applied scientific approaches and stringent comparisons of various experimental conditions. The current state of knowledge does not allow one to state categorically whether alterations in calcium homeostasis are the key and primary event in AD development or that they just accompany other pathological changes. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that disturbances in calcium homeostasis appear early in the disease before the onset of its first symptoms. Therefore, therapeutic strategies which aim to correct calcium dysregulation may be successful in treatment and are likely to slow down the progress of AD.
