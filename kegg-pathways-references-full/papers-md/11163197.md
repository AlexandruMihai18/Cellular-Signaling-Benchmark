## Summary

Tyrosine phosphorylation of adaptor proteins permits the B cell antigen receptor (BCR)-associated protein tyrosine kinases to regulate downstream effector molecules. Here, we report the identification of a novel B cell adaptor for phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K), termed BCAP. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP is mediated by Syk and Btk, thereby providing binding site(s) for the p85 subunit of PI3K. Disruption of the BCAP gene in the DT40 B cell line inhibits BCR-mediated phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate generation, leading to impaired Akt response. Moreover, recruitment of PI3K to glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) is significantly attenuated in the absence of BCAP. Hence, these data suggest that BCAP bridges BCR-associated kinases to the PI3K pathway by regulating PI3K localization.


## Introduction

B cell antigen receptor (BCR) engagement triggers a cascade of biochemical events that culminate in B cell activation, which entails the proliferation and differentiation of B cells. The BCR utilizes phosphorylation of the Igα and Igβ immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) to activate nonreceptor protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs). Sequential activation of three distinct classes of PTKs (the Src-PTKs, Syk, and Btk) is required for regulating downstream signaling pathways. Indeed, deficiencies in any of these three families of PTKs result in defective or aberrant B cell function and development (DeFranco, 1997; Reth and Wienands, 1997; Tamir and Cambier, 1998; Kurosaki, 1999). Thus, the mechanisms by which these BCR-associated PTKs regulate the generation of downstream second messengers have been an area of intense investigation.

The efficient and coordinated generation of a number of second messengers, including IP₃ (inositol[1,4,5]trisphosphate) and PI(3,4,5)P₃ (phosphatidylinositol[3,4,5] trisphosphate), is required for normal B cell function. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) is responsible for the production of PI(3,4,5)P₃ and participates in the regulation of cell proliferation, survival, metabolism, cytoskeletal reorganization, and membrane trafficking (Leevers et al., 1999; Rameh and Cantley, 1999). Heterodimer-type (class Ia) PI3Ks consist of a catalytic subunit (p110) and a regulatory subunit encoded by at least three distinct genes (p85α, p85β, and p55γ). p85α is the most abundantly expressed regulatory isoform of PI3K, and the importance of this subunit for B cell development and proliferation has been recently underscored by gene targeting experiments in mice. In fact, the proliferative response of B cells to BCR stimulation was diminished in the absence of the p85α subunit (Fruman et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 1999).

Despite the key role of the p85 subunit in BCR signaling, the mechanism by which the BCR-associated PTKs regulate the PI3K pathway still remains unclear. This mechanism is likely to involve the two SH2 domains of the p85 subunit. Both SH2 domains bind with high affinity to phosphotyrosines in the YxxM motif, and this SH2-dependent binding to docking proteins is thought to be important for recruitment of PI3K to the plasma membrane and for increasing the specific activity of the enzyme (Shoelson et al., 1993; Fruman et al., 1998). Such docking partners include CD19, a B cell-specific membrane protein containing two YxxM motifs in its cytoplasmic region. Indeed, when stimulated by BCR, CD19 is tyrosine phosphorylated, thereby providing the binding site(s) to the p85 subunit (Tuveson et al., 1993; Buhl and Cambier, 1999). However, given that B cell developmental and functional defects in $p85\alpha^{-/-}$ mice are more severe than those in $CD19^{-/-}$ mice, this CD19-mediated activation mechanism seems not to fully account for the activation mode of the PI3K (Engel et al., 1995; Rickert et al., 1995; Fruman et al., 1999; Suzuki et al., 1999).

Based upon the hypothesis that additional adaptor molecules may participate in linking between BCR-associated PTKs and PI3K, we have purified a novel protein, termed BCAP, by using the p85 SH2 domain. Here, we report the molecular and functional characterization of BCAP and demonstrate that BCAP plays an important role in BCR-mediated PI3K activation.


## Results

### Molecular Identification of BCAP

The strategy used for purifying BCAP was based upon its ability to associate with SH2 domains of PI3K p85 subunits following BCR cross-linking. As each SH2 domain of the p85 subunit has been shown to bind with high affinity to similar phosphotyrosine-containing sequences (Songyang et al., 1993), we have employed a

Figure 1. Cloning of a Novel Protein BCAP

(A) The Ponceau S staining of pp100. The position of pp100, excised for microsequencing, is indicated by the bracket on the right.

(B) The sequences of chicken and mouse BCAP were aligned by the CLUSTAL X program (Thompson et al., 1997). Identical amino acids are in the filled boxes. The chicken sequence represents clone 2. The arrow indicates the start of the open reading frame of clone 11. Peptide sequences obtained from microsequencing were as follows (amino acid number): AQRPENL (560–566), TPGQRQLITLQEQV (599–612), IVPYSIE ALDK (293–303), FLEGGSTDAPDSGE (492–505), ETIVRPVRDLS (576–586), and MGILNVDEAVL (614–624).

(C) Schematic representation of predicted motifs and structures in the chicken BCAP and Drosophila Dof proteins. The ankyrin repeats (BCAP amino acids 336–404), the coiled coils (636–666), and the proline-rich regions (532–538, 773–779, and 792–798) are indicated by boxed “AR,” “CC,” and “P,” respectively. Potential tyrosine phosphorylation sites (with amino acid numbers in the brackets) known for SH2 binding motifs are indicated: YxxM for PI3K, YxNx for Grb2, and YxxV for SHP-2. The coiled-coil prediction was according to the algorithm of A. Lupas (Lupas, 1996).

two-step affinity purification with the immobilized N-terminal SH2 domain of p85 and anti-phosphotyrosine mAb, leading to isolation of pp100 from BCR-activated chicken DT40 B cells (see Experimental Procedures). Six internal peptide sequences were obtained from microsequencing of pp100 (Figure 1A), and the sequences TPGQRQLITLQEQV and IVPYSIEALDK were used to generate degenerate oligonucleotides. A DT40 cDNA library was screened by mixtures of these oligonucleotides, leading to isolation of a 2.7 kb cDNA clone (clone 2). Its open reading frame gives rise to an 800 amino acid polypeptide with a calculated molecular weight of 90,152 Da (Figure 1B). The six peptides derived from pp100 were all present in the open reading frame. The slight increase in the apparent molecular weight estimated from SDS-polyacrylamide gels of 100,000 Da could be due to the acidic nature of the BCAP polypeptide (calculated isoelectric point, 4.85).

The murine counterpart of chicken BCAP was also cloned from a mouse spleen cDNA library. An isolated

clone encodes an 811 amino acid polypeptide that shares 65% identity to the predicted chicken BCAP (Figure 1B). Comparison of the deduced primary amino acid sequence of BCAP with the NCBI protein database shows weak homology to Drosophila Dof protein (Figure 1C) (Vincent et al., 1998). Both BCAP and Dof have an ankyrin repeat-like sequence (residues 336–404 in chicken BCAP and residues 366–440 in Dof) and a short sequence predicted to form a coiled-coil structure (residues 633–666 in chicken BCAP and residues 703–741 in Dof). Chicken BCAP contains 31 potential tyrosines that may become phosphorylated. As potential SH2 binding sites (Songyang et al., 1993, 1994), BCAP possesses four YxxM motifs (PI3K p85 subunit), one YxNx motif (Grb2), and one YxxV motif (SHP-2), while Dof has one YxxM motif, five YxNx motifs, and one YxxV motif (Figure 1C). In addition, BCAP but not Dof contains three conserved proline-rich regions predicted to bind Src-PTKs, PLC-γ, and Grb2 N-terminal SH3 domains (Figure 1C) (Sparks et al., 1996).

Cell lysates and immunoprecipitates with anti-chicken BCAP Ab or anti-mouse BCAP Ab were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and blotted with anti-BCAP Ab. In the left panel, BCAP immunoprecipitates from BCAP-deficient DT40 cells and from COS cells transfected with chicken BCAP cDNA clone 2 or clone 11 were also analyzed.

The exon encoding the initiation methionine for clone 2 is located further upstream of the region shown here. The middle exon containing the primer "b" sequence corresponds to the alternative 5′ sequence found in clone 11, and the first methionine for clone 11 (methionine 169 in Figure 1B) is encoded in the exon containing the primer "c." The joint of the exons encoding clone 2 forms the codon of aspartic acid (the residue 144) in the 800 amino acid polypeptide shown in Figure 1B.

(D and E) Cellular localization of BCAP. Wild-type (wt) and BCAP-deficient DT40 cells (BCAP⁻) were stained with anti-BCAP Ab (green) and with propidium iodide for nuclear staining (red) and were visualized by confocal microscopy (upper panels in [D]). In lower panels, COS cells transiently transfected with BCAP cDNA clone 2 (COS/BCAP) and nontransfected COS cells (COS) were stained with anti-BCAP Ab and propidium iodide. Cytosolic and membrane fractions of DT40 cells, unstimulated (minus symbol) or stimulated with 4 μg/ml M4 for 2 min (plus symbol), were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-chicken BCAP Ab or M4 (E).

Distribution of BCAP transcripts was investigated by Northern blot analyses using various mouse tissues and cell lines (Figure 2A). Transcripts were seen predominantly in spleen and at low levels in thymus, liver, and lung. BCAP mRNA was expressed in the B cell lines (WEHI279 and L1210), pre-B cell line (18–81), and macrophage cell lines (P388D1 and WEHI3) but not in the plasma cell lines (J558L and P3U1), T cell lines (EL-4 and BW5147), mast cell line (P815), erythroid cell line (B813), or several nonhematopoietic cell lines (B16, Y1, NIH3T3, and ES-E14). Based on these data, we conclude that BCAP is expressed predominantly in B cells and macrophages.

Protein expression of BCAP in B cells was analyzed with polyclonal Abs raised against chicken BCAP (residues 410–540) and mouse BCAP (residues 603–797). Western blot analyses detected four proteins with molecular weight values of 100, 98, 72, and 70 kDa (for reference, designated BCAP4, BCAP3, BCAP2, and BCAP1, respectively) in lysates of both DT40 and mouse splenic B cells (Figure 2B). Ablation of the chicken BCAP gene resulted in loss of all four protein species, suggesting that these species could arise from alternative transcripts of the BCAP gene and/or posttranslational modifications. To examine these possibilities, we extensively screened the DT40 cDNA library, leading to isolation of a 2.5 kb cDNA clone (clone 11) containing the alternative 5′ sequence. The open reading frame of clone 11 encodes a 632 amino acid polypeptide with the truncated N-terminal sequence (a calculated molecular weight of 70,904 Da) (see legend of Figure 1B). Expression of cDNA clone 11 in COS cells gave rise to proteins that comigrated with BCAP1/BCAP2, while proteins comigrated with BCAP3/BCAP4 emerged upon transfection.

**Figure 3. BCR-Induced Tyrosine Phosphorylation of BCAP**

(A) Tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP and its association with p85 in DT40 cells (left panel) and mouse splenic B cells (right panel). At the indicated time points after BCR stimulation (4 μg/ml M4 for DT40 cells and 15 μg/ml anti-mouse IgM (Fab)₂ fragment for mouse splenic B cells), immunoprecipitates with anti-chicken BCAP or anti-mouse BCAP Ab (5 × 10⁶ DT40 cells/lane and 1 × 10⁷ mouse splenic B cells/lane) were separated on 7.5% SDS-PAGE gel and analyzed by Western blotting with 4G10, anti-BCAP Ab, or anti-p85 Ab. As a negative control experiment, we also analyzed BCAP-deficient DT40 cells. The positions of the multiple BCAP species BCAP1–6 are indicated.

(B) Tyrosine phosphorylation of CD19 and its association with p85 in mouse splenic B cells.

(C) BCAP tyrosine phosphorylation in DT40 cells deficient in Lyn, Syk, or Btk.

**Tyrosine Phosphorylation of BCAP Is Mediated by Syk and Btk**

Immunoprecipitation of BCAP from resting and BCR-activated DT40 B cells demonstrated that all four species undergo receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation that peaks at 1 min and returns to nearly basal levels by 30 min (Figure 3A; data not shown). The tyrosine phosphorylation extent of BCAP3/BCAP4 was ~5-fold higher than that of BCAP1/BCAP2, determined by the ratio of the anti-phosphotyrosine signal to the anti-BCAP signal. Moreover, in addition to these four species, two more slowly migrated species (shown by BCAP5 and BCAP6) were detected in DT40 B cells after BCR cross-linking, and their phosphorylation peaks were relatively delayed (10 min) compared with that of BCAP3/BCAP4. These observations suggest the heterogeneity of the tyrosine phosphorylation status on BCAP after BCR cross-linking. The heterogeneity of BCAP tyrosine phosphorylation status after BCR stimulation was also detected in mouse splenic B cells, although the extents of tyrosine phosphorylation of mouse BCAP1 and BCAP2 were relatively high compared with chicken ones. In the case of mouse splenic B cells, tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP declined more rapidly than in DT40 cells (Figure 3A).

To identify the PTKs responsible for BCAP tyrosine phosphorylation upon BCR cross-linking, we analyzed BCAP phosphorylation in a cohort of chicken DT40 cell lines lacking Lyn, Syk, or Btk (Figure 3C) (Takata et al., 1994; Takata and Kurosaki, 1996). In Lyn-deficient cells, the tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP5/BCAP6 was markedly increased, although the phosphorylation ex-

tents of BCAP3 and BCAP4 were attenuated. In contrast, only marginal phosphorylation of BCAP3/BCAP4 was observed in Syk-deficient DT40 cells. In Btk-deficient DT40 cells, BCAP was tyrosine phosphorylated to a similar extent after 1 min of BCR stimulation as wild-type cells, while this phosphorylation declined by 10 min following the onset of BCR stimulation (Figure 3C). Taken together, these data suggest that Syk and Btk contribute to initiating and sustaining BCAP phosphorylation, respectively, in the BCR signaling context. Because Btk is activated to some extent even in Syk-deficient DT40 cells (Kurosaki and Kurosaki, 1997), the residual phosphorylation of BCAP observed in Syk-deficient cells may reflect the compensatory action of Btk in initiating BCAP phosphorylation. Our results also demonstrate that, in contrast to a positive role of Syk and Btk, Lyn plays a negative role in BCR-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP.

Association of BCAP with PI3K p85 in B Cells
Since BCAP was purified as a binding partner to the N-terminal SH2 domain of the PI3K p85 subunit in vitro, we examined whether the interaction between BCAP and p85 occurs in vivo in B cells. Immunoprecipitates of BCAP were examined for association with PI3K p85 from resting and BCR-activated B cells. As shown in Figure 3A, p85 inducibly associated with BCAP upon BCR stimulation in both chicken DT40 and mouse splenic B cells, and p85 could not be detected in immunoprecipitates from BCAP-deficient DT40 cells. The extent of p85 association with BCAP was well correlated with BCAP tyrosine phosphorylation status (Figure 3A). Consistent with the previous reports (Tuveson et al., 1993; Buhl and Cambier, 1999), p85 also associated with CD19 after BCR stimulation in splenic B cells (Figure 3B).

BCAP Is Involved in BCR-Induced PI3K Activation
To address the function of BCAP, we established BCAP-deficient DT40 lines by the gene-targeting method (see Experimental Procedures). Lack of BCAP expression was confirmed by Western blot analyses (Figure 3A). The level of cell surface expression of BCR on BCAP-deficient DT40 clones was essentially the same as that of parental DT40 cells (Figure 4A). Little change of the BCR-induced overall tyrosine phosphorylation was detected between wild-type and BCAP-deficient DT40 cells (Figure 4B), suggesting that the BCR-associated PTKs such as Lyn and Syk are activated normally in the absence of BCAP.

To examine the effect of BCAP on PI3K signaling, we measured the in vivo accumulation of PI(3,4,5)P₃ in wild-type and BCAP-deficient DT40 cells. BCR stimulation increased radiolabeled PI(3,4,5)P₃ content in DT40 cells, which was abolished by prior treatment with 100 nM wortmannin. As shown in Figure 5A, BCR-mediated PI(3,4,5)P₃ accumulation was attenuated by 50% in BCAP-deficient cells, leading to the 2-fold decrease of Akt activation (Figure 5B). Since JNK activation is also shown to be PI3K dependent in many systems (Klippel et al., 1996; Timokhina et al., 1998), we also examined the effect of BCAP on JNK activation. Indeed, the BCR-induced JNK activation was abolished by wortmannin

Figure 4. Disruption of the BCAP Gene in Chicken DT40 B Cells
Loss of BCAP expression by targeted disruption of BCAP gene was already shown in Figures 2 and 3A.

(B) BCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation in wild-type and BCAP-deficient DT40 cells. At the indicated time points after stimulation with M4 (4 μg/ml), whole-cell lysates prepared from 2 × 10⁶ cells were loaded onto SDS-PAGE (8% gel) and analyzed by Western blotting with 4G10.

treatment, and only marginal JNK activation was detected in BCAP-deficient DT40 cells (Figure 5C). As predicted from the decrease of Akt activation in BCAP-deficient DT40 B cells, BCR-induced apoptosis was significantly enhanced in the mutant cells (Figure 5D) because Akt is well known to prevent apoptosis (Datta et al., 1999). In addition, as PI(3,4,5)P₃ accumulation was reported to be involved in PLC-γ activation through Tec kinases including Btk (Scharenberg and Kinet, 1998), we measured BCR-induced IP₃ generation and found that it was also significantly diminished in BCAP-deficient cells (Figure 5E). Collectively, these results demonstrate a critical role for BCAP in activating the PI3K pathway. However, the residual PI(3,4,5)P₃ accumulation

Cells loaded with [³²P]orthophosphate were incubated with or without 100 nM wortmannin for 10 min and stimulated with M4 (4 μg/ml). The spot of PI(3,4,5)P₃ marker is indicated by an arrowhead. A typical example of these results is shown in the upper panel. In the lower panel, fold increases of PI(3,4,5)P₃ level normalized to total phospholipids after BCR stimulation are shown. The results are shown by average and SEM of three independent experiments (see Experimental Procedures). The actual percentages of PI(3,4,5)P₃ radioactivity in total phospholipids at time zero were 0.15% ± 0.03%, 0.13% ± 0.04%, and 0.07% ± 0.01% in wild-type DT40 cells, BCAP-deficient DT40 cells, and wortmannin-treated wild-type cells, respectively.

Akt and JNK were immunoprecipitated and assayed for in vitro kinase activity using histone H2B and GST-cJun, respectively, as a substrate. The reactions were separated by SDS-PAGE and autoradiographed (upper panels). The protein levels of Akt and JNK in immunoprecipitates were analyzed by Western blot analysis (lower panels).

in BCAP-deficient DT40 B cells suggests the existence of BCAP-independent PI3K activation mechanism(s) in B cells.

### Phosphorylation of YxxM Motifs in BCAP Is Critical for PI3K Activation

To address the requirement for the YxxM motifs of BCAP (clone 2) in PI3K activation, we generated a mutant chicken BCAP in which the four potential YxxM motifs were mutated to FxxM sequences. When expressed in BCAP-deficient DT40 B cells, significant tyrosine phosphorylation of BCAP(Y4F) was still observed upon BCR engagement, indicating the existence of additional tyrosine phosphorylation sites in BCAP (Figure 6A). However, phosphorylation of BCAP5/BCAP6 in BCAP(Y4F) was decreased as compared with wild-type BCAP. Despite the residual phosphorylation of BCAP(Y4F), this mutant BCAP failed to associate with the PI3K p85 subunit as well as to restore the defective Akt activation

(Figures 6A and 6B). Likewise, BCR-induced JNK activation was restored by wild-type BCAP but not by BCAP(Y4F) (Figure 6C). Therefore, these data further support our conclusion that, after being phosphorylated, BCAP provides the docking site(s) for the p85 SH2 domains, thereby participating in PI3K activation. IP₃ production was restored completely by wild-type BCAP and partially by BCAP(Y4F) (data not shown), suggesting that BCAP contributes to PLC-γ activation in both YxxM motif-dependent and -independent manners.

### Translocation of p85 to GEMs Is Attenuated in BCAP-Deficient Cells

Recruitment of PI3Ks to the membrane is an essential process for the regulation of the enzymes by growth factor receptors (Klippel et al., 1996; Gillham et al., 1999). Furthermore, it has been recently demonstrated that, upon TCR engagement, PI3Ks are redistributed to special subdomains of the plasma membrane known as

BCAP, like LAT in T cells, is constitutively localized in GEMs and therefore functions as a scaffold protein in BCR signaling (Zhang et al., 1998). However, in the case of BCAP, the majority of BCAP was localized in non-GEMs before stimulation, though a small fraction of BCAP was reproducibly observed in GEMs. The amounts of BCAP proteins in GEMs were not significantly changed upon BCR engagement, while a presumably phosphorylated form of BCAP emerged after BCR stimulation (Figure 7).

### Discussion

Despite the importance of the PI3K p85α subunit for B cell development and BCR signaling, the exact nature of the connection between BCR-activated PTKs and PI3K is still unclear. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel PTK substrate, BCAP, which couples BCR to PI3K activation. Using DT40 cell lines deficient in Lyn, Syk, and Btk, we found that both Syk and Btk contribute to BCAP tyrosine phosphorylation. Thus, the previous evidence that BCR-mediated PI3K activation is attenuated in Syk-deficient B cells could be explained, at least partly, by the requirement for Syk in BCAP phosphorylation (Beitz et al., 1999). In contrast to a severe overall attenuation of BCAP phosphorylation in Syk-deficient B cells, Btk-deficient cells exhibited the defect particularly in the sustained phase of BCAP phosphorylation (Figure 3C). The straightforward interpretation of these data is that Syk and Btk participate in initiating and sustaining BCAP phosphorylation, respectively.

Contrary to the role of Syk and Btk in promoting BCAP tyrosine phosphorylation, Lyn appears to play an overall inhibitory role (Figure 3C). One potential explanation for this is the ability of Lyn to recruit SH2 domain-containing tyrosine phosphatases into the BCR signaling complex by phosphorylating ITIMs of inhibitory receptors such as CD22 and PIR-B (Tamir et al., 2000). In the case of CD22, it is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated by Lyn after BCR cross-linking, thereby recruiting SHP-1 (Cornall et al., 1998; Nishizumi et al., 1998; Smith et al., 1998). Assuming the existence of such inhibitory receptors in DT40 B cells, the hyperphosphorylation of BCAP in Lyn-deficient cells could be accounted for by the functional loss of inhibitory receptors. This inhibitory function may not be necessarily conferred by inhibitory receptors. Indeed, cytoplasmic signaling molecules such as Gab1/2 are also known to recruit SHP-2 in an SH2 phosphoryle-dependent manner, thereby activating these phosphatases (Tamir et al., 2000).

The deduced amino acid sequence of BCAP contains one ankyrin repeat-like region, one coiled-coil domain, and three proline-rich regions (Figure 1C). In *Drosophila*, Dof has been identified as a downstream regulator that appears to be specific for the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR)-mediated signal transduction pathway (Vincent et al., 1998). Although the overall homology between BCAP and Dof is weak, these proteins exhibit 54% and 44% homology in the ankyrin repeat-like region and the coiled-coil domain, which might be important for the subcellular localization of Dof and BCAP through their interactions with other proteins. While Dof has been

DT40 cells were stimulated with M4 (4 μg/ml) and subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-chicken BCAP Ab.

glycolipid-enriched microdomains (GEMs) (Xavier et al., 1998), whereby the PI3Ks access their substrates such as PI(4,5)P₂ (phosphatidylinositol[4,5]biphosphate) (Pike and Miller, 1998). Based on these previous observations, we hypothesized that BCAP might be involved in BCR-induced recruitment of PI3Ks to GEMs. To test this idea, we examined the BCR-mediated redistribution of PI3K p85 in wild-type versus BCAP-deficient cells by fractionation of DT40 cell lysates in sucrose density gradients. Consistent with the previous reports (Cheng et al., 1999; Aman and Ravichandran, 2000), Lyn was enriched in Triton-insoluble GEMs (mainly fraction number 4), and α-tubulin was excluded from the GEMs (Figure 7). In unstimulated wild-type DT40 B cells, a small amount of p85 was located in GEMs, which was increased following BCR cross-linking. In contrast, this recruitment was markedly attenuated in BCAP-deficient cells, although low level of p85 recruitment still occurred (Figure 7). These results implicate that BCAP participates in the recruitment of PI3K to GEMs.

The above observations suggest the possibility that

Wild-type and BCAP-deficient DT40 cells, unstimulated (minus symbol) or stimulated with 4 μg/ml M4 (plus symbol), were lysed and fractionated in sucrose gradient. Fractions (30 μl/lane; numbered from low to high density) were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with anti-p85 Ab, anti-chicken BCAP Ab, anti-Lyn Ab, and anti-tubulin Ab.

shown to be involved in the Ras-ERK pathway (Vincent et al., 1998), BCR-mediated ERK activation occurs normally in BCAP-deficient DT40 cells (data not shown). This difference might reflect the existence of a greater number of favored binding sites (YxNx) for the Grb2 SH2 domains within Dof (five sites in Dof versus only one site in BCAP).

Chicken BCAP contains 31 potential tyrosines that may become phosphorylated, and four of these are within consensus binding motifs for the SH2 domain of PI3K p85. The importance of phosphorylation on these four tyrosines is directly demonstrated by the failure of BCAP(Y4F) to restore Akt activation as well as to inducibly bind to p85 (Figure 6). Our finding that BCAP(Y4F) still undergoes tyrosine phosphorylation clearly indicates the existence of additional phosphorylation sites on BCAP after BCR cross-linking. Although the significance of these sites has not been addressed by our study, given that several tyrosine phosphorylated proteins still coimmunoprecipitate with BCAP(Y4F) (Figure 6A; data not shown), it is possible that other SH2 domain-containing proteins associate with these sites, thereby contributing, at least in part, to the functions of BCAP.

GEMs, sometimes referred to as detergent-insoluble lipid rafts, have been proposed to function as platforms for the formation of multicomponent signaling complexes (Langlet et al., 2000). BCAP is not enriched in GEMs within the plasma membrane like LAT or Src family PTKs. Nevertheless, a small fraction of BCAP is localized in GEMs before BCR stimulation, suggesting the heterogeneity of subcellular localization of BCAP. Thus, it would be possible that a small fraction of BCAP undergoes posttranslational modifications and/or association with other membrane proteins, thereby being localized in GEMs. Additional studies are underway to define the significance of the small GEM-associated BCAP in exerting its functions.

Similar to the redistribution of PI3K p85 to GEMs observed after TCR stimulation (Xavier et al., 1998), p85 is recruited to GEMs after BCR cross-linking in DT40 B

cells. This recruitment is perturbed by loss of BCAP (Figure 7). Given the failure of BCAP(Y4F) to restore the recruitment of the p85 to GEMs (data not shown), the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between BCAP and PI3K p85 would target PI3K to GEMs. Consequently, the PI3K is allowed to access its substrate PI(4,5)P₂, as PI(4,5)P₂ is known to be enriched in GEMs (Pike and Miller, 1998). In addition, binding of PI3K with BCAP per se could upregulate the PI3K enzymatic activity, presumably by its conformation change as previously reported for other p85 binding proteins (Shoelson et al., 1993; Buhl et al., 1997). Both events are likely important for PI(3,4,5)P₃ generation via BCAP after BCR cross-linking.

The reduced JNK activation in BCAP-deficient DT40 B cells following BCR engagement could be accounted for by the decreased PI3K activation. Rac and Cdc42 are thought to be activated by a PH domain-containing guanine-nucleotide exchange factor, Vav, leading to the JNK activation (Crespo et al., 1997). Thus, given the importance of PI(3,4,5)P₃ in PH domain-mediated Vav activation (Han et al., 1998), sufficient amounts of PI(3,4,5)P₃ would be required for Vav activation in its coupling to the JNK pathway. Because Akt is known to play an antiapoptotic role through phosphorylation of BAD, caspase 9, IκB kinase (IKK), and Forkhead transcriptional factors (Datta et al., 1999), the enhanced BCR-mediated apoptosis in BCAP-deficient cells can be explained in part by the decreased activation of Akt. In addition, given the recent evidence that JNK is also involved in an antiapoptotic process (Leppa and Bohmann, 1999), the hyperapoptosis observed in BCAP-deficient DT40 cells could be caused by the decreased activation of both Akt and JNK.

The residual PI(3,4,5)P₃ generation and the subsequent Akt activation in BCAP-deficient DT40 B cells clearly demonstrate the involvement of additional molecules for the complete activation of PI3K in B cells. An obvious possibility is that, like participation of both insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and IRS-2 in insulin's metabolic actions (Withers et al., 1999), other BCAP

isoform(s) may exist and function as redundant molecules. Other candidate molecules are Gab, Cbl, and CD19, as these molecules contain YxxM motifs. Indeed, these molecules are shown to be tyrosine phosphorylated upon BCR stimulation, thereby associating with PI3K p85 (reviewed in Gold, 2000). Among these molecules, Cbl is unlikely to play an important role, particularly in DT40 B cells, because Cbl-deficient DT40 cells exhibit apparently normal BCR-mediated PI3K activation (Yasuda et al., 2000). Thus, assuming the expression of chicken homologs of Gab and CD19 in DT40 B cells, the remaining PI(3,4,5)P₃ production and Akt activation in BCAP-deficient cells could be attributable to CD19- and/or Gab-dependent activation of PI3K. In fact, in murine splenic B cells, PI3K is recruited to both BCAP and CD19 after BCR cross-linking (Figures 3A and 3B). The decrease of PI(3,4,5)P₃ generation in BCAP-deficient cells might not merely reflect the quantitative change of PI3K activation during BCR signaling; rather, qualitative changes of PI3K activation processes might occur in the mutant cells. For instance, if two steps, namely initiating and sustaining processes, are coordinately required for full activation of the PI3K pathway, the initiation process could occur via the above discussed molecules such as CD19, and BCAP may be responsible for maintaining or amplifying PI3K activation. In this regard, temporal resolution of our PI(3,4,5)P₃ and Akt assay systems may not have sufficed enough to distinguish these differences. Future studies will be needed to determine functional interaction(s) between BCAP-dependent and -independent mechanisms in PI3K activation in B cells.

### Experimental Procedures

#### Cells and Antibodies
Wild-type and its derivative mutant DT40 cells were cultured in RPMI1640 supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 1% chicken serum, 50 μM 2-mercaptoethanol, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. COS-7 cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 10% FCS, 2 mM L-glutamine, penicillin, and streptomycin. Preparation of mouse splenic B cells was as described previously (Hashimoto et al., 2000). Anti-BCAP Abs and anti-CD19 Ab were obtained by immunizing rabbits with bacterially expressed GST fusion protein containing chicken BCAP (410–540 amino acid region), mouse BCAP (603–797), or mouse CD19 (C-terminal 49 amino acids). The anti-chicken IgM Ab, M4, the anti-mouse IgM Ab, anti-phosphotyrosine Ab (4G10), and anti-chicken Lyn Ab were described previously (Ishiai et al., 1999; Hashimoto et al., 2000). The following Abs were purchased: anti-p85 Ab from Upstate Biotechnology, anti-Akt1 Ab and anti-α-tubulin Ab from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, and anti-JNK1 Ab from PharMingen.

#### Purification of Chicken pp100 and Peptide Sequencing
DT40 cells (1.5 × 10¹⁰) were stimulated for 3 min at 2 × 10⁸ cells/ml in RPMI1640 with M4 (4 μg/ml) at 37°C. Cells were lysed in NP-40 buffer (1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris [pH 7.5], and 1 mM EDTA) containing 50 mM NaF and 0.5 mM pervanadate supplemented with protease inhibitor as described previously (Takata et al., 1994). After centrifugation at 13,000 × g, supernatant was precleaned with Sepharose 4B and then incubated with a p85-SH2(N) affinity column, which was prepared by coupling 5 mg GST-p85-SH2(N) protein to 4 ml Glutathione-Sepharose with dimethyl pimelimidate. Beads were then washed with ten bed volumes of NP-40 lysis buffer and eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl and 1% SDS for 5 min at 95°C. Eluate was diluted with NP-40 lysis buffer and incubated with 2 ml of protein A Sepharose-conjugated 4G10 for 12 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed with 50 bed volumes of NP-40 lysis buffer and then eluted with TBS containing 0.1% CHAPS, 50 mM phenylphosphate, 0.1 mM sodium vanadate, and protease inhibitors. After being concentrated and desalted by Centricon-10 (Amicon), final samples were subjected to 7% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to PVDF membrane (Applied Biosystems), and stained with Ponceau S. The band for pp100 was excised and digested with Achromobacter protease I. Digested peptides were chromatographed by reverse-phase HPLC (Wako Pure Chemical), and amino acid sequencing was performed with a gas-phase sequencer (Shimadzu, model PPSQ-23). We obtained six peptide sequences, as shown in Figure 1 legends.

#### cDNA Cloning and Sequencing
The degenerate oligonucleotides were synthesized based upon the peptide sequences TPGQRQLITLQEQQV and IVPYSIEALDK. ³²P-labeled oligonucleotides at the 5′ end were used as a probe for screening of the plasmid DT40 cDNA library (pJG4-5 vector; GenBank accession number U89961). Eight clones were isolated and sequenced. The sequence of the longest insert (clone 2) has been deposited into GenBank (accession number AF293805). By using the obtained BCAP cDNA (clone 2) as a probe, further screening of the DT40 cDNA library was performed, leading to the isolation of clone 11 with the alternative 5′ sequence (accession number AF315784). A mouse EST clone (accession number AA178577) was found by homology search of the NCBI database with the chicken BCAP cDNA sequence. A λZAP mouse cDNA library was screened by using the EST DNA as a probe, giving rise to the isolation of 17 clones. The longest insert contained the open reading frame encoding 811 amino acids (accession number AF293806).

#### Generation of BCAP-Deficient DT40 Cells
DT40 genomic DNA containing exons that correspond to chicken BCAP amino acid residues 223–800 was cloned by the PCR method. The targeting vectors pBCAP-bsr and pBCAP-puro were constructed by replacing the 11 kb genomic DNA fragment containing exons that correspond to amino acids 338–721 with bsr and puro cassettes (Sugawara et al., 1997). These cassettes were flanked by 3.5 kb and 3.5 kb of BCAP genomic sequences on the 5′ and 3′ sides. DT40 cells transfected sequentially with pBCAP-bsr, and pBCAP-puro were screened as described previously (Sugawara et al., 1997). DT40 cells deficient in Lyn, Syk, or Btk were described previously (Takata et al., 1994; Takata and Kurosaki, 1996). In the BCAP(Y4F) mutant construct, the codons of tyrosine residues (199, 423, 448, and 463) in chicken BCAP cDNA (clone 2) were changed to those of phenylalanine by the PCR method. Wild-type and the mutant chicken BCAP cDNAs with the C-terminal flanking FLAG epitopic tag were cloned into pcDNA3.1 vector (Invitrogen). BCAP-deficient DT40 cells were transfected with FLAG-tagged cDNA constructs and selected in the presence of 2 mg/ml G-418. Transfection was performed by electroporation at 550V, 25 μF. Expression of transfected cDNA was confirmed by Western blot analysis using anti-FLAG Ab.

#### Immunofluorescence Microscopy
COS-7 cells were transfected with the FLAG-tagged chicken BCAP cDNA construct by the calcium phosphate method. After 48 hr, transfected COS cells were grown on coverslips for 6 hr. COS cells on coverslips or DT40 cells in suspension were fixed with 3.7% paraformaldehyde in PBS and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS. After treatment with 100 μg/ml RNase for 10 min and blocking with 10% FBS-containing PBS (FBS/PBS), cells were incubated with anti-chicken BCAP Ab for 1 hr and washed with FBS/PBS three times. Then cells were incubated with 2 μg/ml FITC-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG Ab (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and 0.4 μg/ml propidium iodide for 1 hr and washed with FBS/PBS three times. Stained cells were mounted with Fluoromount-G (Southern Biotechnology Associates) and analyzed by FLUOVIEW confocal microscope (Olympus).

#### Flow Cytometric Analysis
BCR expression and apoptosis were analyzed by using FACScan (Becton Dickinson) as described previously (Yasuda et al., 2000). The x and y axes for the histograms indicate fluorescence intensity (4-decade-log scales) and relative cell number, respectively.

Northern Blot Analysis
Mouse tissue RNA was prepared from various tissues of 8-week-old C57/BL6 mice using RNAzol B (Tel-Test Inc.). Multiple mouse cell line Northern blots were provided by Drs. Goitsuka and Kitamura (Science University of Tokyo). Twenty micrograms of total RNA was separated in 1% agarose formaldehyde gel, transferred to Hybond-N⁺ membrane (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech), and probed with ³²P-labeled mouse BCAP or β-actin cDNA.

Immunoprecipitation and Western Blot Analysis
For immunoprecipitation, cells were solubilized in NP-40 lysis buffer supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors as described previously (Takata et al., 1994), and precleared lysates were sequentially incubated with proper Abs and protein A-agarose. Lysates or immunoprecipitates were separated by SDS-PAGE gels, transferred to polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) membrane, and detected by the indicated Abs and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) system (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

For in vitro kinase assays of Akt, immunoprecipitates with anti-Akt1 Ab were washed four times with 0.5 ml of the lysis buffer and twice with 0.1 ml of the assay buffer (20 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 10 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM MnCl₂, 10 μM sodium vanadate, 2 mM dithiothreitol, 10 μM PKA inhibitor, and 10 μM PKC inhibitor). Half of each immunoprecipitate was subjected to the kinase reaction in 40 μl of the assay buffer supplemented with 5 μg histone (H2B), 5 μM ATP, and 10 μCi [γ-³²P]ATP. After 20 min incubation at 30°C, the reactions were terminated by the addition of SDS sample buffer and boiled for 5 min. The samples were separated by SDS-PAGE gel (15%) and subjected to autoradiography. The other half of each immunoprecipitate was used for Western blot analysis to quantify immunoprecipitated Akt. In vitro kinase assays of JNK were performed as described previously (Hashimoto et al., 1998).

Subcellular Fractionation and Preparation of GEM Fractions
Preparation of cytosolic and membrane fractions of DT40 cells was performed as described previously (Ishiai et al., 1999). Fractionation of DT40 cell lysates in sucrose density gradients for preparation of GEM fractions was described previously (Ishiai et al., 2000).

PI(3,4,5)P₃ and IP₃ Analysis
DT40 cells (10⁷ cells/ml) were radiolabeled in calcium buffer (10 mM HEPES [pH 7.4], 135 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 1 mM CaCl₂, 1 mM MgCl₂, and 5.6 mM glucose) with 1 mCi/ml [³²P]orthophosphate (NEN Life Science Products) for 1 hr. After being washed once with calcium buffer, cells (10⁷ cells/time point) were stimulated with M4 (4 μg/ml). The reactions were quenched by addition of 750 μl methanol/1.2 N HCl (1:1), and lipid was extracted with 600 μl chloroform. ³²P-labeled PI(3,4,5)P₃ marker was prepared by reacting PI(4,5)P₂ (Sigma) and [γ-³²P]ATP in the presence of immunoprecipitates with anti-p85 Ab. For thin-layer chromatography (TLC), samples were spotted onto a silica gel plate (EM Science) pretreated with potassium oxalate and developed in chloroform/acetone/methanol/acetic acid/water (40:15:13:12:7). The radioactivity of PI(3,4,5)P₃ spots was quantified by using a Fuji FLA2000 bioimaging analyzer and was normalized to the total radioactivity in phospholipids of the samples. Then the resulting values were normalized to the value at time zero of BCR stimulation for each of three independent experiments and averaged. Measurement of IP₃ was performed as described previously (Ishiai et al., 1999).
