Cardiac Ca²⁺ Signaling and Ca²⁺ Sensitizers

Masao Endoh, MD

The role of Ca²⁺ in cardiac excitation–contraction (E-C) coupling has been established by simultaneous measurements of contractility and Ca²⁺ transients by means of aequorin in intact myocardium and Ca²⁺ sensitive fluorescent dyes in single myocytes. The E-C coupling process can be classified into 3 processes: upstream (Ca²⁺ mobilization), central (Ca²⁺ binding to troponin C) and downstream mechanism (thin filament regulation and crossbridge cycling). These mechanisms are regulated differentially by various inotropic interventions. Positive force-frequency relationship and effects of β-adrenoceptor stimulation, phosphodiesterase 3 inhibitors and digitalis are essentially exerted via upstream mechanism. Alpha-adrenoceptor stimulation, endothelin-1, angiotensin II, and clinically available Ca²⁺ sensitizers, such as levosimendan and pimobendan, act by a combination of the upstream and central/downstream mechanism. The Frank-Starling mechanism and effects of Ca²⁺ sensitizers such as EMD 57033 and Org 30029 are primarily induced via the central/downstream mechanism. Whereas the upstream and central mechanisms are markedly suppressed in failing myocytes and under acidic conditions, Ca²⁺ sensitizers such as EMD 57033 and Org 30029 can induce cardiotoxic effects under such conditions. Ca²⁺ sensitizers have high therapeutic potential for the treatment of contractile dysfunction in congestive heart failure and ischemic heart diseases, because they have energetic advantages and less risk of Ca²⁺ overload and can maintain effectiveness under pathological conditions.

T he heart is able to adjust its pump function to immediately meet the demand of vital organs in the body by increasing cardiac output several fold by means of increases in cardiac contractility and heart rate. Cardiac myocytes constitute a pseudo-syncytium, follow the all-or-none law, and all of them contribute to the maintenance of stroke volume. Therefore, under physiological conditions, alteration of the contractility of individual cardiac myocytes is directly reflected in cardiac pump function.

Two of the most important intrinsic characteristics of the contractile regulation of cardiac myocytes are the Frank-Starling mechanism and the positive force–frequency relationship. The Frank-Starling mechanism represents the basic cardiac contractility as a length–tension relationship ex vivo and left ventricular (LV) function curve in vivo, in which stretching of myocytes to an optimal length immediately increases the contractile force with little alteration of [Ca²⁺]i, preceding to a stretch-induced slowly developing increase in contractile force associated with an increase in [Ca²⁺]i mobilization. The positive force–frequency relationship induced by elevated heart rate increases ventricular contractility by a marked facilitation of [Ca²⁺]i mobilization, resulting in an increase in stroke volume!

In addition to the intrinsic regulatory mechanisms characteristic of cardiac myocytes, numerous external regulatory mechanisms, including receptor activation induced by neurotransmitters released by autonomic nerve stimulation, hormones, autacoids and cytokines, contribute to the adaptation of the cardiac pump? In the operation of all of these multiple mechanisms, cardiac Ca²⁺ signaling plays a key role in contractile regulation.

In 1978, Allen and Blinks developed an experimental procedure for detecting [Ca²⁺]i simultaneously with contractile activity by applying the Ca²⁺-sensitive bioluminescent protein aequorin to intact cardiac muscle³ Since then, it has been directly demonstrated by the use of aequorin and other fluorescent dyes such as fura-2, indo-1, and fluo-3 that Ca²⁺ ions play a central role in the regulation of cardiac excitation–contraction (E-C) coupling in the intact myocardium or single cardiac myocytes.

Although cardiac contractile regulation is essentially achieved by dynamic modulation of [Ca²⁺]i mobilization (upstream mechanism), it has been proved that the process subsequent to elevation of [Ca²⁺]i (central and downstream mechanism) is also an important target of cardiotonic agents and the contractile modulation induced by physiological and pathological interventions on the heart.

In the early 1980s there was a strong movement toward the development of cardiotonic agents that act by novel mechanisms to replace the conventional cardiotonic agents, such as digitalis and catecholamines, that were used to treat the cardiac contractile dysfunction in congestive heart failure (CHF)!² Those agents elicit a positive inotropic effect (PIE) by increasing [Ca²⁺]i (upstream mechanism) and therefore are generally associated with the risk of serious adverse effects because of [Ca²⁺]i overload. Digitalis inhibits Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase that provides the energy for the Na⁺ pump to extrude Na⁺, results in [Na⁺]i accumulation, and thereby increases [Ca²⁺]i through suppression of the forward mode and/or facilitation of the reverse mode Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX). The safety margin of digitalis is extremely narrow, its blood levels show a wide range of individual variation

among patients, and characteristic ventricular arrhythmias, including bigeminy and trigeminy, are readily induced during treatment, which impairs ventricular function and is dangerous for the patient. Although catecholamines are effective in improving contractile dysfunction by intravenous bolus and/or continuous infusion in acute heart failure, they likewise elicit readily Ca²⁺ overload, leading to various types of cardiac arrhythmias. In addition, catecholamines were available only parenterally, and their PIE is often rapidly lost during subacute and chronic administration because of alteration of signaling process including β-adrenergic receptor downregulation.

The early stage of development of novel cardiotoxic agents appeared to be rather easy because of the numerous and serious adverse effects of existing agents, but over the course of the next 3 decades, knowledge of the pathophysiology of CHF increased prominently and through trial and error of the pharmacological treatments, it was realized that the pharmacological therapy of CHF is complicated by compensatory mechanisms and a simple increase in cardiac contractility by cardiotoxic agents is not sufficient and rather harmful for the prognosis of the disease. Namely, it became evident that an improvement of contractile dysfunction does not always result in an improved prognosis (ie, prolongation of lifespan), which caused a marked paradigm shift in pharmacological treatment from inotropic therapy to cardiac unloading and/or protective therapy.

Herein, I review the measurement of [Ca²⁺]i, to aid understanding of the physiological regulation of cardiac E-C coupling, the pathological modulation induced by acidosis and heart failure, and the mechanism and potential therapeutic relevance of cardiotoxic agents. In particular, I focus on the mechanisms of the Ca²⁺ sensitizers, which act by an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity, because they have great therapeutic potential in respect of their potential beneficial effects to overcome the disadvantages of currently clinically available cardiotoxic agents that act primarily by increasing [Ca²⁺]i.

Ca²⁺ in Cardiac E-C Coupling

Upon membrane depolarization, the Ca²⁺ influx via activated voltage-dependent L-type Ca²⁺ channels triggers Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by activation of ryanodine receptors through the Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release (CICR) mechanism that elevates [Ca²⁺]i to 10⁻⁶–10⁻⁵ mol/L from the resting level of approximately 10⁻⁷ mol/L. Ca²⁺ ions released via the CICR mechanism diffuse through the cytosolic space to the contractile proteins, constitute the peak of Ca²⁺ transients, and bind to troponin C. Ca²⁺ binding to troponin C releases the troponin I-induced inhibition of thin (actin-troponin-tropomyosin) and thick (myosin) filament interactions, leading to sliding of the filaments (ie, cardiac contraction) as shown in Fig 1.

After achieving the peak of Ca²⁺ transients, [Ca²⁺]i returns to the diastolic level mainly by activation of sarcoplasmic Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA2a) and the sarcolemmal (SL) NCX and partly by the SL and mitochondrial Ca²⁺ pumps.

It is useful for defining the mode of action of various inotropic interventions to divide the regulation of cardiac Ca²⁺ signaling into 3 different processes: (1) the upstream mechanism, which increases intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization and thereby Ca²⁺ transients; (2) the central mechanism, in which Ca²⁺ binding to troponin C triggers crossbridge cycling; and (3) the downstream mechanism, which involves Ca²⁺-dependent regulation of crossbridge cycling by the thin filament complex and Ca²⁺-independent direct modulation of crossbridge cycling kinetics (Fig 1).

It should be noted that these mechanisms interact with each other to regulate myocardial contractility in the intact myocardium. The upstream mechanism activates the central mechanism via a positive feedback mechanism in such a manner that the force generation by an increase in the number of crossbridges because of activation of the upstream mechanism enhances the Ca²⁺ binding affinity to troponin C (ie, the central mechanism) (Fig 1). Therefore, the alteration induced by a pure elevation of the extracellular Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]o) has to be used as a standard for comparison

with various inotropic interventions that act on different E-C coupling processes in intact cardiac muscle²,⁴

# Experimental Procedures

Simultaneous measurement of Ca²⁺ transients with alteration of contractile function in intact myocardium and/or single cardiac myocytes is an excellent experimental procedure for differentiating the mode of action of inotropic interventions; namely, whether alterations in contractile function are exerted by modulation of Ca²⁺ transients (upstream mechanism), Ca²⁺ binding affinity and stability of Ca²⁺-troponin C complex (central mechanism), or thin filament and/or direct regulation of crossbridge cycling (downstream mechanism)³.

Allen and Blinks detected intracellular Ca²⁺ transients in intact frog ventricular myocardium by using aequorin³, which is an apoprotein with the molecular size of approximately 20kDa associated with a chromophore, coelenterazine, extracted from vesicles in the tentacle of a jellyfish named *Aequorea (A.) folskalea* or *A. aequorea*. An aequorin molecule has 3 Ca²⁺ binding sites, and upon binding of 3 molecules of Ca²⁺, it emits light. Experimentally, the intensity of aequorin bioluminescence emitted upon Ca²⁺ binding is proportional to the power of 2.5 of the Ca²⁺ concentration. Therefore, the relationship of the power of –2.5 of aequorin light intensity and Ca²⁺ concentration is linear on a semi-logarithmic scale over the range of physiological [Ca²⁺]i (10⁻⁷–10⁻⁵ mol/L) in cardiac myocytes⁵ Because the rate of light emission is rapid enough to follow the dynamic alteration of [Ca²⁺]i in cardiac myocytes, the intensity of aequorin light signals detected from the myocardium by means of a photomultiplier in a dark room can be used as an indicator of [Ca²⁺]i in intact myocardium⁵ Multicellular preparations of cardiac muscle loaded with aequorin by microinjection or chemical loading are fixed in an organ bath set up in a dark room, and superfused with oxygenated Krebs-Henseleit solution at 37°C. Contractile force and aequorin light signals are recorded simultaneously. These preparations have the advantage that the light signal can be stably detected with least movement artifacts, thus maintaining the intact physiological regulatory process. Cardiac contractility can be detected under ideal experimental conditions, in which the muscle is stretched to an optimal length close to that which produces the maximal contractile force (Lmax). In addition, the response to inotropic interventions is not altered by aequorin loading and can be detected at a physiological temperature of 37°C⁴,⁵ On the other hand, the disadvantages of aequorin methods include the hazardous procedures of aequorin handling and loading, and the requirement of signal averaging to obtain sufficient Ca²⁺ transients. It should be noted that a much larger number of cells contributes to the force generation than the cells from which the aequorin signals are measured in multicellular preparations. In addition, the aequorin light signal reflects alterations in the cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration, and may not always represent the [Ca²⁺] at troponin C binding sites. Therefore, potential modulation of Ca²⁺ signaling by as yet unknown processes in intact myocytes is not completely excluded. Nonetheless, using aequorin methods with myocardial preparations is an excellent procedure for analyzing the dynamic changes in [Ca²⁺]i in intact cardiac muscle.

It is postulated that aequorin molecules are distributed evenly throughout the cytosolic space in cardiac myocytes, whereas in smooth muscle cells there is experimental evidence that the distribution of aequorin molecules is limited to a space narrower than that in which indo-1 molecules are distributed⁶

Single cardiac myocytes loaded with a Ca²⁺-sensitive fluorescent dye, such as indo-1, fura 2, and fluo 3, are currently used more widely because of the ease of indicator handling and experimental procedures. Although these procedures provide elegant experimental preparations, the results obtained have to be analyzed more carefully than do those obtained with aequorin methods. For example, the diastolic level of the fluorescence signal exceeds readily the peak of Ca²⁺ transients in the absence of an increase in contractility, for example when the frequency of stimulation is raised, which never occurs in aequorin-loaded preparations. In addition, single myocytes are contracting (shortening) from a slack length, which is far from the ideal situation for measurement of contractile responses to inotropic interventions.

To elucidate the contribution of these issues to the experimental data, it is useful to compare the drug response in indo-1-loaded single cells and aequorin-loaded multicellular preparations. When the effects of levosimendan on Ca²⁺ transients and contractility are compared in indo-1-loaded single cell and aequorin-loaded multicellular preparation, the concentration–response curves for levosimendan-induced increases in Ca²⁺ transients and contractility show essentially identical pharmacological characteristics in both preparations⁷ These observations indicate that the pharmacological characteristics of levosimendan in indo-1-loaded cardiac myocytes are unaltered from those in aequorin-loaded multicellular preparation. In contrast, the concentration-dependence of the response to endothelin-1 (ET-1) shows a prominent difference according to the preparation: indo-1-loaded single myocytes are much more sensitive than aequorin-loaded ventricular myocardium, which indicates that the procedure for preparing single myocytes could increase the receptor affinity to ET-1⁸ These observations indicate that for analyses of inotropic effects of drugs in single myocytes, it is important to take the characteristics of the cardiotoxic agent and the preparation into consideration.

## Influence of Alteration of [Ca²⁺]₀

The response to alteration of [Ca²⁺]₀ can be used as a standard for comparing with other inotropic interventions, in the respect that the relationship between Ca²⁺ transients and contractile function is altered with an elevation of [Ca²⁺]₀ by pure modulation of the upstream mechanism⁹ It should be noted that feedback regulation of Ca²⁺ binding affinity of troponin C (the central mechanism) exerted through activation of the downstream mechanism contributes to the regulation induced via upstream mechanism (Fig 1). When certain inotropic interventions shift the relationship of contractile force vs peak Ca²⁺ transients to the left or right of the relation obtained by alteration of [Ca²⁺]₀ with little change in the time course of Ca²⁺ transients, it is postulated that the interventions increase or decrease myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity, respectively⁹ When [Ca²⁺]₀ is altered stepwise, the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients and contractile force are changed in parallel. The relationship of contractile force and (peak aequorin light)⁻²·⁵ is linear when it is plotted on a semi-logarithmic scale⁹

Intrinsic Regulatory Mechanism

Two major intrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are essential for immediate adjustment of cardiac contractile function to rapidly changing demands of blood supply to the body are the Frank-Starling mechanism and the positive force-frequency relationship, which are achieved by facilitation of the characteristic and contrasting processes of cardiac Ca²⁺ signaling.

### Frank-Starling Mechanism

Upon stretch of cardiac muscle fibers, contractile force is increased in a time-dependent manner: an immediate increase in contractile force upon stretch (Frank-Starling mechanism), followed by a slowly developing increase in association with a parallel increase in Ca²⁺ transients.

When the contractile force is increased immediately after the stretch by the Frank-Starling mechanism, the amplitude of the aequorin light signal is essentially unchanged, indicating that the Frank-Starling mechanism is exerted via the central/downstream mechanism. The aequorin light signal at Lmax is slightly abbreviated compared with that at slack length, probably because of the positive feedback mechanism (ie, an increase in Ca²⁺ binding affinity to troponin C induced by the force generation) (Fig 1). Two potential mechanisms underlie the Frank-Starling mechanism. First, the optimum overlapping of thin and thick filaments has long been considered to play an essential role, whereas the second mechanism of an abbreviated radial distance between the actin and myosin head (lattice spacing) with stretch, which is modulated by a giant protein known as titin, has been proposed more recently.

The increase in contractile force induced by stretching of cardiac muscle fibers, involving the Frank-Starling mechanism and a slowly developing stretch-induced response, reflects the basic myocardial contractility, and underlies the cellular basis of the length-tension relationship in isolated cardiac muscle and the LV function curve in both experimental animals and patients.

The LV function curve, to which both the stretch-induced immediate (Frank-Starling mechanism) and the slowly developing PIE associated with an increase in Ca²⁺ transients contribute, is aggravated in patients with chronic CHF. Digitalis improves the LV function curve in patients, essentially exerted via the upstream mechanism: inhibition of Na⁺/K⁺ ATPase by digitalis may accumulate [Na⁺]i, which induces an increase in [Ca²⁺]i through suppression of the forward mode and/or facilitation of the reverse mode NCX. The SR Ca²⁺ store thereby increased leads to facilitation of Ca²⁺ release from ryanodine receptors, which may contribute to reversing the impaired stretch-induced slowly developing PIE. An increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity via the positive feedback mechanism driven by activation of the upstream mechanism (Fig 1) may contribute to the beneficial effect of digitalis on the LV function curve. However, the contribution of stretch-activated ion channels to the response to stretch in cardiac myocytes is equivocal, because the Ca²⁺ influx via voltage-dependent L-type Ca²⁺ channels plays an extremely important role in cardiac E-C coupling.

### Positive Force-Frequency Relationship

When the ventricular myocardium of most mammalian species contracts at higher frequencies over the range of physiological heart rate, contractile force is increased, which has been well recognized and documented as the positive force-frequency relationship, another important intrinsic regulatory mechanism of myocardial contractility. In contrast to the Frank-Starling mechanism, the positive force-frequency relationship in mammalian ventricular myocardium is primarily associated with a prominent increase in the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients.

The increase in Ca²⁺ transients induced by an elevation of stimulation frequency is caused by an increased Ca²⁺ store in the SR, which is released via ryanodine receptors and constitutes the peak of Ca²⁺ transients. Two mechanisms are considered to be responsible for the increase in the SR Ca²⁺ store induced by stimulation at higher frequencies. First, an increase in the cumulative depolarization duration per unit time at higher frequencies results in a prolongation of the opening time of the voltage-dependent L-type Ca²⁺ channel, leading to increased Ca²⁺ influx and Ca²⁺ uptake by SERCA2a in the SR Ca²⁺ store. Second, repetitive stimulation at higher frequencies accumulates Na⁺ in the sub-SL microdomain in cardiac myocytes, which may lead to an increase in [Ca²⁺]i through suppression of the forward mode and/or activation of the reverse mode NCX. Calmodulin/CaMKII signaling may play an important role in the induction of the positive force-frequency relationship.

The positive force-frequency relationship disappears or is inverted to negative in the late stage of CHF, which is associated with abolition or inversion of the increase in Ca²⁺ transients observed with elevation of stimulation frequency under physiological conditions. It is reported that an increase in [Na⁺]i, but not in [Ca²⁺]i induced by isoproterenol, reverses the inverted force-frequency relationship, probably through activation of the upstream mechanism.

### External Regulatory Mechanisms

External regulatory mechanisms modulate diverse physiological and pathophysiological regulatory processes of cardiac Ca²⁺ signaling and cardiotoxic agents. Activation of β-adrenoceptors is of extreme importance among the external regulatory mechanisms because it mediates the effect of endogenous neurohumoral regulators for immediate adaptation of cardiac pump function under physiological conditions and the PIE of sympathomimetic amines as cardiotoxic agents, and contributes significantly to the pathological process of heart failure, while β-adrenoceptors are being downregulated in severe heart failure.

Activation of α₁ adrenergic angiotensin II type 1 (AT₁) and endothelin type A (ETA) receptors is coupled to Gq/11 proteins to stimulate phosphoinositide hydrolysis, resulting in production of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) and diacylglycerol (DAG), and exerting immediate modulation of contractile function by the combination of a moderate increase in Ca²⁺ transients and an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity.

Stimulation of muscarinic cholinergic and adenosine receptors plays an important role in activating the inhibitory regulatory pathways of cardiac Ca²⁺ signaling. Inhibition is exerted by activation of a dual signaling pathway: the direct pathway by activation of K⁺ channels (IKACH current), and the indirect pathway through suppression of the cAMP-mediated facilitatory regulation. Contractile suppression via both the direct and indirect inhibitory pathways is associated with a decrease in the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients.

and heart failure, diverse signaling processes triggered by activation of cytokine receptors come into play to significantly modulate the pathological features of the disease through cardiac Ca²⁺ signaling.¹⁶

Cardiotonic agents play a crucial role in reversing cardiac contractile dysfunction in acute CHF, and in the aggravating phase of chronic CHF, through facilitation of Ca²⁺ mobilization (Ca²⁺ mobilizers), an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity (Ca²⁺ sensitizers) or both mechanisms.²¹⁻²³

### Beta-Adrenoceptor Stimulation

Most sympathomimetic amines, such as norepinephrine, epinephrine, isoproterenol, dobutamine, and phenylephrine and dopamine, in the presence of α-adrenoceptor blockade increase Ca²⁺ transients in a concentration-dependent manner by activation of β-adrenoceptors.⁹ Beta-adrenoceptor stimulation elicits an increase in contractile function with the highest efficacy among the Ca²⁺ mobilizers, and is characterized by a marked increase in Ca²⁺ transients and a pronounced abbreviation of twitch contraction (Fig 2). In cardiac myocytes, the β₁-adrenoceptor that is coupled exclusively to activation of adenylyl cyclase through Gs proteins is the predominant subtype, although the β₂-adrenoceptor coupled to both Gs and Gi proteins also exists.

The relationship between contractile force and Ca²⁺ transients is shifted to the right of that with elevation of [Ca²⁺]₀, which is ascribed to 2 mechanisms: activation of SERCA2a induced by phospholamban phosphorylation and a decrease in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity because of troponin I phosphorylation.⁹

For a given increase in contractile force, abbreviation of the contraction induced by β-adrenoceptor stimulation is much more pronounced than that induced by an elevation of [Ca²⁺]₀, whereas the difference in the abbreviation of Ca²⁺ transients induced by either inotropic intervention is marginal and observed only in the late phase of the decline of Ca²⁺ transients.⁹ These observations indicate that the decrease in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity induced by troponin I phosphorylation may play an important role in β-adrenoceptor-mediated abbreviation of contraction.⁹

The Ca²⁺ signal modulation achieved by the β-adrenoceptor/cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is exerted through serine/threonine phosphorylation of cardiac Ca²⁺ regulatory proteins, including (1) L-type Ca²⁺ channels (an increase in availability of Ca²⁺ channels that results in increased Ca²⁺ influx upon membrane depolarization); (2) phospholamban (activation of SERCA2a by disinhibition of dephosphorylated phospholamban, leading to an increase in the SR Ca²⁺ store); (3) ryanodine receptors (facilitation of Ca²⁺ release from the SR); (4) troponin I (decreased myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity); (5) myosin binding protein C (MyBP-C); and (6) the NCX (findings on NCX phosphorylation are currently controversial).² In contrast to β₁-adrenoceptor activation that induces all of these processes, the effect of β₂-adrenoceptor stimulation is confined to activation of L-type Ca²⁺ channels with no facilitation of other processes, in association with a lesser or undetectable increase in cAMP and [Ca²⁺]i.¹⁵,¹⁶

#### Alpha-Adrenoceptor Stimulation

Alpha-adrenoceptors had long been supposed to play an insignificant role in cardiac functional regulation, but they are recognized as playing a role in cardiac contractile regulation by the combination of an increase in Ca²⁺ transients and Ca²⁺ sensitivity subsequent to stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis through activation of Gq/11 proteins, leading to the production of IP₃ and DAG that activates protein kinase C (PKC).¹⁷

In rabbit papillary muscle, phenylephrine in the presence of a β-adrenoceptor blocking agent elicits a PIE by activation of cardiac α₁-adrenoceptors in association with a moderate increase in Ca²⁺ transients, which is much less than that induced by β stimulation. In contrast to β stimulation, the PIE of α₁-adrenoceptor stimulation is accompanied by an increase in Ca²⁺ transients much lower than that induced by elevation of [Ca²⁺]₀. The relationship of Ca²⁺ transients and contractile force is shifted to the left of the relation during elevation of [Ca²⁺]₀, indicating that α₁-adrenoceptor stimulation increases myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity in addition to a moderate increase in Ca²⁺ transients.⁹

The α₁-adrenoceptor stimulation induces a reciprocal change in the duration of contraction and Ca²⁺ transients: prolongation of twitch contraction associated with an abbreviation of Ca²⁺ transients, indicating increased Ca²⁺ binding affinity of troponin C leading to prolongation of contraction simultaneously with abbreviated Ca²⁺ transients because of a decrease in Ca²⁺ available for aequorin binding.⁹ The maximum contractile response induced by α₁-adrenoceptor stimulation is approximately 60% of the maximal response to isoproterenol (ISOmax), whereas that of Ca²⁺ transients amounts to only 10% of ISOmax, which indicates that increased myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity plays an important role in the PIE of phenylephrine mediated by α₁-adrenoceptor stimulation.¹⁷ Dopamine induces the PIE by activation of both α₁- and β-adrenoceptors.⁹

Angiotensin II via AT₁ receptors and ET-1 via ETA receptors induce a PIE very similar to that of α₁ stimulation, in the respect that the PIE is associated with a moderate increase in Ca²⁺ transients and an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity.⁸,¹⁵,¹⁸,¹⁹

Muscarinic Cholinergic Receptor Stimulation

Muscarinic receptor stimulation induces activation of a dual signaling pathway. First, activation of the potassium channels (I<sub>KACH</sub>) abbreviates the action potential duration, which is dominant in the sino-atrial node, atrium and atrioventricular node, but not in ventricular myocardium. In atrial muscle, muscarinic stimulation elicits a negative inotropic effect (NIE) associated with a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients via a cAMP-independent signaling pathway. Among mammalian species, this inhibitory pathway is particularly dominant in ferret ventricular myocardium, leading to a marked NIE associated with a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the absence of β stimulation.<sup>20,24</sup> In ferret papillary muscle, for a given decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, the decrease in contractile force induced by the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol, which activates the I<sub>KACH</sub> current via G<sub>i</sub> proteins and stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis via G<sub>q</sub> proteins, was less than that caused by lowering [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub>. These observations indicate that muscarinic receptor stimulation elicits a dual action on Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling: a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, and an increase in myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity.<sup>20</sup>

In the presence of β stimulation, muscarinic receptor activation elicits a pronounced NIE through suppression of the cAMP-mediated signaling pathway in ventricular myocardium, which has long been recognized as an “anti-adrenergic action” or “accentuated antagonism” in mammalian ventricular myocardium.<sup>20,25</sup> This indirect inhibitory action of muscarinic receptor stimulation is associated with a parallel decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, the underlying mechanism of which is ascribed either to a decrease in cAMP accumulation through activation of G<sub>i</sub> proteins and/or to activation of a phosphatase that dephosphorylates the regulatory proteins, including phospholamban, L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels, ryanodine receptor and troponin I, phosphorylated beforehand by activation of PKA.<sup>26–28</sup> Stimulation of muscarinic receptors inhibits the increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and contractile force induced by β stimulation, forskolin and phosphodiesterase (PDE) 3 inhibitors (milrinone and amrinone), which is mediated by inhibition of the cAMP/PKA pathway.<sup>25</sup>

Endothelin Isopeptides

The PIE of the endothelin isopeptides (ET-1, ET-2 and ET-3) shows a wide range of species-dependent variation.<sup>29,30</sup> Endothelin isopeptides elicit a PIE in association with a moderate increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and an increase in myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in most mammalian ventricular and atrial muscle, but not in dog ventricular myocardium.<sup>19,29</sup> In rabbit ventricular myocardium, the PIE of ET-1 is most pronounced among mammalian species examined, mediated mainly by atypical ETA receptors,<sup>31</sup> and is associated with stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.<sup>32,33</sup> Pharmacological analysis implies that the signaling pathways of the PIE and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitization induced by ET-1 involve activation of PKC and tyrosine kinase,<sup>34</sup> the NCX,<sup>35</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger.<sup>36</sup>

While ET-1 elicits a small transient NIE in association with a parallel decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients, in the presence of β stimulation, ET-1 elicits a pronounced long-lasting NIE (anti-adrenergic action).<sup>37</sup> The anti-adrenergic action of ET-1 is partly because of suppression of cAMP-mediated L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activation<sup>38,39</sup> and activation of phosphatase<sup>28</sup> via pertussis toxin-sensitive G<sub>i</sub> proteins.<sup>37,38</sup>

In dog ventricular myocardium, ET-1 produces a PIE and/or NIE by crosstalk with norepinephrine, depending on the preexisting concentration of norepinephrine.<sup>40</sup> In the presence of norepinephrine at subthreshold or threshold concentration (10<sup>-10</sup>–10<sup>-9</sup> mol/L) for induction of the PIE, ET-1 elicits a concentration-dependent PIE in association with a moderate increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and an increase in myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity.<sup>40</sup> This effect requires simultaneous activation of PKC and PKA.<sup>40</sup> In addition, pharmacological analyses imply that different kinases, including tyrosine kinase,<sup>41</sup> myosin light chain kinase,<sup>42</sup> and Rho kinase,<sup>43</sup> are involved in the increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity induced by crosstalk of ET-1 and norepinephrine at low concentrations in dog ventricular myocardium.

When the concentration of norepinephrine is increased further to 10<sup>-8</sup>–10<sup>-6</sup> mol/L, it elicits a pronounced PIE in association with a concentration-dependent increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients through activation of β-adrenoceptors. Under such conditions, ET-1 exerts an anti-adrenergic action and inhibits the PIE of norepinephrine with a parallel decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients via activation of protein kinase G and subsequent stimulation of phosphatases.<sup>28,40</sup> These observations imply that cardiac Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling is regulated by ET-1 in different processes, the predominant effect being expressed according to the norepinephrine concentration by crosstalk that leads to bi-directional contractile alteration.<sup>40</sup>

In mouse ventricular myocytes, ET-1, as well as angiotensin II and phenylephrine (α<sub>1</sub>-adrenoceptor stimulation), elicit a pronounced long-lasting NIE in association with a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in the absence of β stimulation.<sup>44</sup> The ET-1-induced NIE is ascribed to a decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients because of stimulation of the forward mode NCX<sup>45</sup> induced by activation of PKC via generation of DAG, which is inhibited by overexpression of DAG kinase.<sup>46</sup>

Angiotensin II

The inotropic effect and alteration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling induced by angiotensin II are very similar to those produced by α-adrenoceptor agonists and the ET isopeptides. The PIE of angiotensin II is mediated by the AT<sub>1</sub> receptor subtype,<sup>47</sup> shows a wide range of species-dependent variation<sup>48</sup> and is associated with stimulation of phosphoinositide hydrolysis.<sup>47,48</sup> The PIE of angiotensin II is induced by the combination of an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients and myofilament Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity,<sup>49,50</sup> the underlying mechanisms of which involve the activation of the L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel,<sup>51,52</sup> NCX<sup>52</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger.<sup>49</sup>

Cardiotonic Agents

Cardiotonic agents are indispensable for improving contractile dysfunction in acute heart failure, and in the aggravating phase of chronic CHF.<sup>21–23</sup> These agents act on various processes of cardiac E-C coupling (ie, the upstream mechanism, central/downstream mechanism or a combination of both). Most cardiotonic agents currently available for clinical use induce their PIE via the upstream mechanism by facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilization through cAMP-dependent and cAMP-independent pathways, leading to an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in intact myocardial cells (Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilizers).<sup>53,54</sup> Cardiotonic agents such as digitalis, catecholamines (dobutamine, dopamine) and PDE 3 inhibitors (milrinone, amrinone, orprinone, enoximone, piroximone) are Ca<sup>2+</sup> mobilizers. On the other hand, Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitizers are capable of inducing their PIE by increasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding affinity of troponin C or stability of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-troponin C complex (central mechanism) and/or facilitation of thin filament regulation of cross-

bridge cycling and/or direct facilitation of crossbridge cycling (downstream mechanism) as shown in Fig 1. Pimobendan and levosimendan act by a combination of the upstream and central/downstream mechanisms.

### Ca²⁺ Mobilizers

Ca²⁺ mobilizers increase contractile function and Ca²⁺ transients in the same way as the elevation of [Ca²⁺]₀. The agents that act via the cAMP-mediated pathway (β-adrenergic receptor agonists, forskolin and PDE 3 inhibitors) shift the force–Ca²⁺ transient relationship to the right, and accelerate the rate of decline of Ca²⁺ transients by an increase in the Ca²⁺ uptake rate into the SR via SERCA2a and a decrease in the Ca²⁺ sensitivity of troponin C by troponin I phosphorylation. Ca²⁺ mobilizers generally have the risk of Ca²⁺ overload, which leads to cardiac arrhythmias, myocardial cell injury and ultimately cell death, so co-administration of agents that act through different mechanisms (e.g., digitalis and catecholamines or PDE 3 inhibitors) readily induces cardiac arrhythmias by Ca²⁺ overload. The increase in Ca²⁺ transients induced via the cAMP-mediated pathway is abolished by the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol or acetylcholine, whereas the PIE induced via the cAMP-independent pathway, such as elevation of [Ca²⁺]i, digitalis, and α₁-adrenoceptor stimulation, is unaffected by muscarinic receptor stimulation.

### Ca²⁺ Sensitizers

Ca²⁺ sensitizers are capable of overcoming the disadvantage of Ca²⁺ mobilizers in therapy of CHF patients for the following reasons: (1) Ca²⁺ sensitizers increase neither the activation energy required for Ca²⁺ handling nor the metabolic energy consumed by agents such as catecholamines and PDE 3 inhibitors; (2) they are not associated with potential risks of arrhythmias, cell injury, apoptosis or necrosis because of Ca²⁺ overload; and (3) they are able to reverse contractile dysfunction under pathophysiological conditions, such as the acidosis that is encountered during ischemia/reperfusion and associated with a decrease in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity, myocardial stunning and CHF.

#### EMD 57033

EMD 57033 is a prototype Ca²⁺ sensitizer. The racemic thiadiazine derivative, EMD 53998 (5-[1-(3,4-dimethoxybenzoyl)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydro-6-quinolyl]-6-methyl-3,6-dihydro-2H-1,3,4-thiadiazin-2-one) was shown to act by a combination of PDE 3 inhibition and Ca²⁺ sensitization. The (+)-enantiomer EMD 57033 is a predominant Ca²⁺ sensitizer, whereas the (−)-enantiomer EMD 57439 is a PDE 3 inhibitor. EMD 57033 facilitates actin movement on myosin filaments in motility assays in vitro and activates myofibrillar ATPase activity even under the experimental condition of troponin C having been extracted from myofibrils, indicating that EMD 57033 acts directly on the actin–myosin interface. More recently, the binding site of EMD 57033 was identified in the C-terminal domain of cardiac troponin C. Although EMD 57033 does not increase the Ca²⁺ binding affinity of troponin C, it may stabilize the Ca²⁺ bound conformation of troponin C. Therefore, EMD 57033 may act as a Ca²⁺ sensitizer via dual (i.e., central and downstream) mechanisms. Although a number of studies in experimental animals have shown that EMD 57033 does not impair diastolic function, it was reported to impair cardiac relaxation under certain experimental conditions.

57033 decreases the oxygen cost of cardiac contractility and restores the decreased economy of contraction induced by lowering pH, which supports the view that the Ca²⁺ sensitizer has energetically favorable effects under pathological conditions. EMD 57033 is able to induce a PIE in failing ventricular myocytes isolated from the volume-overloaded rabbit heart, when the PIE of isoproterenol and dobutamine is markedly suppressed.

#### CGP 48506

CGP 48506 (5-methyl-6-phenyl-1,3,5,6-tetrahydro-3,6-methano-1,5-benzo-diazocine-2,4-dione) is a pure Ca²⁺ sensitizer without PDE 3 inhibitory action. CGP 48506 increases the amplitude of cell shortening with little or no change in Ca²⁺ transients in fura 2-loaded rat ventricular myocytes and shifts the pCa-tension relationship to the left in guinea-pig right ventricular Triton-skinned fibers. The PIE is not affected by carbachol, and is not associated with cAMP accumulation, phosphorylation of functional proteins, or activation of phosphorylase phosphatase, indicating that the cAMP-mediated signaling pathway does not contribute to the PIE of the compound. CGP 48506 elicits a PIE in failing myocardium equivalent to that observed in normal cardiac muscle.

#### Org 30029

Org 30029 (N-hydroxy-5,6-dimethoxy-benzo[b]thiophene-2-carboximid-amide hydrochloride) is a Ca²⁺ sensitizer associated with a weak PDE 3 inhibitory action. The inotropic efficacy of Org 30029 is extremely high (150% of ISOmax) in the dog, related to a combination of an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity and weak PDE 3 inhibition. When the effects of Org 30029 are compared with those of isoproterenol in an aequorin-loaded canine ventricular trabecula, the increase in Ca²⁺ transients by Org 30029 is marginal compared with that induced by isoproterenol (Fig 2). The duration of contraction is remarkably prolonged by Org 30029, whereas it is markedly abbreviated by isoproterenol. The potency of Org 30029 as a PDE 3 inhibitor is much lower than that of milrinone or IBMX. Org 30029 produces a PIE of 120% of ISOmax with no increase in Ca²⁺ transients in the presence of carbachol in aequorin-loaded canine ventricular myocardium. The PIE of Org 30029 is not inhibited by acidosis. Org 30029 decreases the oxygen cost of contraction in the rat, but its potency as a cardiotonic agent is relatively low.

#### SCH00013

SCH00013 (4,5-dihydro-6-[1-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-cyanophenyl)ethyl]-1,2,5,6-tetrahydropyrido-4-yl]pyridazin-3(2H)-one) is a Ca²⁺ sensitizer with moderate inotropic efficacy associated with weak PDE 3 inhibition. It affects neither heart rate nor cardiac relaxation. In conscious dogs, SCH00013 elicits a PIE without a positive chronotropic effect by oral administration, and it has a weak selective PDE 3 inhibitory action and class III anti-arrhythmic action.

#### Levosimendan

Levosimendan {(R)-[(4-(1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-4-methyl-6-oxo-3-pyridazinyl) phenyl]-hydrazono)-propanedinitrile} is a cardiotonic agent acting by combination of an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity and PDE 3 inhibition. Levosimendan binds to the amino-terminal region of troponin C with high affinity, does not affect the Ca²⁺-binding affinity of cardiac troponin C, but stabilizes the conformation of the

Ca²⁺-troponin C complex.  

Levosimendan possesses a selective inhibitory action on PDE 3 activity, with a potency as high as that of milrinone. The potency of levosimendan for PDE 3 inhibition in vitro is much higher than that of its Ca²⁺ sensitizing action in skinned cardiac fibers and intact cardiac myocytes.⁵⁴ It has been reported that levosimendan acts preferentially via myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitization at lower concentrations, whereas at higher concentrations the PDE 3 inhibitory action comes into play in the PIE in patients with chronic CHF.⁶³ Although this view is favored by cardiologists, as well as by basic pharmacologists, pieces of experimental evidence in the early studies are weak and not compelling, mainly because the detailed concentration-response relationship for the increase in Ca²⁺ transients and the PIE was not assessed.⁵⁴,⁶³  

A detailed examination of the concentration-response relationship of the Ca²⁺ transients and contractile force has definitely revealed that levosimendan increases Ca²⁺ transients and myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity over the same concentration range in nonfailing ventricular myocardium of the dog and rabbit.⁷,⁶⁴ In dog ventricular myocardium, the PIE of levosimendan up to $10^{-5}$ mol/L was associated with an increase in Ca²⁺ transients and a shift in the relationship

during application of levosimendan is essentially unaltered by acidosis, whereas the PIE of levosimendan is suppressed prominently by acidosis, because of attenuation of the increase in Ca²⁺ transients induced by the compound, its efficacy being markedly decreased under acidosis.⁶⁴

It is noteworthy that the PIE of levosimendan can be inhibited by the muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist, carbachol⁷,⁶⁴ Carbachol abolishes the PIE and increase in Ca²⁺ transients induced by levosimendan. These observations imply that levosimendan first increases the amplitude of Ca²⁺ transients by cAMP accumulation because of PDE 3 inhibition, and that the increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity is exerted in a Ca²⁺-dependent manner by enhancing the levosimendan-induced increase in Ca²⁺ transients.⁷,⁶⁴ A complex interaction between cAMP-mediated signaling and the levosimendan-induced increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity may exist. After washout of simultaneously administered carbachol and levosimendan a pronounced PIE without a definite increase in Ca²⁺ transients has been induced, probably because carbachol is washed out more readily than levosimendan.

Levosimendan is metabolized to the active metabolite OR-1896, which likewise elicits a PIE by a combination of an increase in Ca²⁺ transients and Ca²⁺ sensitivity.⁶⁵,⁶⁶ The influence of acidosis on the OR-1896-induced PIE and Ca²⁺ sensitivity is very similar to that on the levosimendan-induced effect.⁶⁷ The PIE and an increase in Ca²⁺ transients induced by OR-1896 are likewise abolished by the muscarinic receptor agonist, carbachol.⁶⁵,⁶⁶

### Pimobendan

Pimobendan [4,5-dihydro-6-(2-(4-methoxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazol-5-yl)-5-methyl-3(2-H)-pyridazinone] induces its PIE by a combination of an increase in myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity and a selective PDE 3 inhibitory action.⁵⁴,⁶⁸ The Ca²⁺ sensitizing and PDE 3 inhibitory actions of pimobendan are induced over the same concentration range.⁵⁴ The relationship between Ca²⁺ transients and contractile force is shifted to the left by pimobendan and its active metabolite UD-CG 212 Cl [4,5-dihydro-6-[2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-1H-benzimidazole-5-yl]-5-methyl-3(2H)-pyridazinone], indicating that both compounds increase myofilament Ca²⁺ sensitivity.⁵⁴,⁶⁹,⁷⁰ The influence of acidosis on the PIE of pimobendan and its active metabolite UD-CG 212 Cl is very similar, in that the increase in Ca²⁺ sensitivity induced by both compounds is suppressed under acidosis.⁵⁴,⁷⁰ Pimobendan has a direct effect on thin filaments, lowering the threshold of [Ca²⁺] for actin sliding in motility assays in vitro, indicating that it acts on the central/downstream mechanism.⁷¹

### Conclusion

Experimental procedures to measure the [Ca²⁺]i in intact myocardium by means of aequorin, and in single cardiac myocytes by loading the fluorescent dye such as indo-1, are useful for differentiating the mode of action of different inotropic interventions; namely, the mechanism of action of cardiotoxic agents. By simultaneous measurements of [Ca²⁺]i with alteration of contractile function, the mode of action of cardiotoxic agents is differentiated as action via Ca²⁺ mobilization, Ca²⁺ sensitization or both mechanisms. The Frank-Starling mechanism is induced by the central/ downstream mechanism, whereas the positive force-frequency relationship is ascribed to activation of the upstream mechanism. Cardiotonic agents are classified into 3 classes, acting as Ca²⁺ mobilizers [digitalis, sympathomimetic amines (β-adrenoceptor stimulation), forskolin, PDE 3 inhibitors], Ca²⁺ sensitizers (EMD 57033, CGP 48506, Org 30029, SCH00013), or acting through both mechanisms (α-adrenoceptor stimulation, endothelin, angiotensin II, levosimendan, pimobendan). Ca²⁺ sensitizers possess potential advantages and disadvantages for the treatment of cardiac contractile dysfunction in CHF, as summarized in Fig 4, compared with conventional cardiotonic agents that act primarily by increasing intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization in cardiac myocytes.
