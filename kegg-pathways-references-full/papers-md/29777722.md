Abstract

Spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA) is a neural disorder, which is caused by degenerative changes in the cerebellum. SCA is primarily characterized by gait ataxia, and additional clinical features include nystagmus, dysarthria, tremors and cerebellar atrophy. Forty-four hereditary SCAs have been identified to date, along with more than 35 SCA-associated genes. Despite the great diversity and distinct functionalities of the SCA-related genes, accumulating evidence supports the occurrence of a common pathophysiological event among several hereditary SCAs. Altered calcium (Ca²⁺) homeostasis in the Purkinje cells (PCs) of the cerebellum has been proposed as a possible pathological SCA trigger. In support of this, signaling events that are initiated from or lead to aberrant Ca²⁺ release from the type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP₃R1), which is highly expressed in cerebellar PCs, seem to be closely associated with the pathogenesis of several SCA types. In this review, we summarize the current research on pathological hereditary SCA events, which involve altered Ca²⁺ homeostasis in PCs, through IP₃R1 signaling.

# Introduction

The cerebellum is an essential part of the brain, responsible for executing motor coordination and learning, as well as certain types of cognitive functions [1, 2]. Among the constituting neurons of the cerebellum, Purkinje cells (PCs) are the largest, and receive excitatory inputs from parallel fibers (PFs) and climbing fibers (CFs) and send inhibitory projections to cerebellar and vestibular nuclei neurons [3-5]. Because PCs are the sole output neurons from the cerebellar cortex, PC malfunction, like degeneration or alternation in synaptic connectivity and spontaneous action potential firing, result in loss of accurate motor and sensory coordination.

Type 1 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor (IP₃R1) is a huge calcium (Ca²⁺) channel of ~400 kDa, which is localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and controls ER Ca²⁺ release to regulate physiological cellular processes, such as cell proliferation, fertilization, immune responses, and brain function [6, 7]. There are three IP₃R isoforms in mammals with different phosphorylation and splicing sites, as well as distinct IP₃-binding affinities and associations with various molecules [7-11]. IP₃R1 is one of the most highly expressed proteins in cerebellar PCs [12]. Particularly, local IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ increase in the spines and dendrites of PCs in response to type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR1) activation by repetitive PF stimulation contributes to the establishment of long-term depression (LTD), a form of PF-PC synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum [13]. IP₃R comprises 5 domains with distinct channel gating roles: (1) the amino-terminus (NH₂) suppressor domain, (2) the IP₃-binding domain, (3) the regulatory/coupling domain, (4) the channel domain, and (5) the gatekeeper domain at the carboxyl-terminus (COOH) (Figure 1A) [11, 14].

The gating mechanism of the IP₃R1 channel by IP₃, which is produced from phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP₂) by being cleaved by phospholipase C (PLC), is an exciting topic, and many groups including ours have shown structural models of IP₃R1 [15-22]. Especially, Fan et al. demonstrated the cryo-EM (electron microscopy) structure of the tetrameric IP₃R1 in its apo-state at near atomic resolution.

level and suggested a critical physical interaction between the cytosolic COOH termini
and the amino-terminal domains of adjacent subunits for channel gating [19] (Figure
1B). In addition, our group found the Ca²⁺-dependent conformational change of IP₃R1
in EM and biochemical analyses [15, 16] and also demonstrated the crystal structures of
the IP₃-binding core [23] and the NH₂ suppressor domain of IP₃R1 [24]. IP₃-dependent
conformational change of the NH₂-terminal domain was also demonstrated by other
groups [25, 26]. Recently, we also succeeded in the crystallization of the large
cytoplasmic domain of IP₃R1 and proposed a crucial role of a leaflet structure in the
helix domain 3 (HD3) to gate the channel (Figure 1A and 1B (indicated in red)) [27].
Thus, IP₃-binding causes a local conformational change of the IP₃ binding core, which
results in a global structural change of large cytosolic domain of IP₃R. This makes the
leaflet structure more outward to open the channel pore to release Ca²⁺ to the cytosol
[27].

The functional importance of the IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in the brain, is
highlighted in the two spontaneously-generated IP₃R1 mutant mice, *opt* and Δ18, and
the genetically-engineered IP₃R1 knockout mice (KO) [28-30]. Both *opt* and Δ18
mutant mice have a homologous in-frame deletion in the regulatory IP₃R1 domain
(Figure 1A). In the *opt* mice, the deletion involves the 1732-1839 amino acid residues
[28], whereas in the Δ18 mice the in-frame 18-base pairs deletion involves the
1533-1538 amino acid residues [29]. Since, both spontaneously-generated mutant mice
exhibit severe reduction in IP₃R1 protein levels, they have very similar phenotypes,
although less severe, when compared to those of the IP₃R1 KO mice. IP₃R1 KO mice
exhibit severe ataxia and seizure-like posture around 10 days after birth and die within
3-4 weeks of birth [30].

IP₃R1 deficient mice show impaired LTD in the PF-PC cerebellar synaptic
transmission [31]. Cerebellar PCs in IP₃R1KO mice have poorly branched dendrite
arbors because of the reduced brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) synthesis in
granule cells [32]. Although there are multiple CF innervations on PCs in mGluR1-
and

protein kinase C gamma (PKCγ)-deficient mice [33, 34], they normally occur in a one-to-one ratio in IP₃R1 deficient mice [30]. Moreover, heterozygous IP₃R1 deficient mice exhibit impaired motor performance in the rotarod test [35].

Distinct functional roles of IP₃R1 in the cerebellum were further examined in brain-specific IP₃R1 conditional KO adult mice. The genetic deletion of IP₃R1 in the cerebellum/midbrain (Wnt1-Cre; Itpr1<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice) leads to similar phenotypes in the total IP₃R1 KO mice, including ataxia and seizure-like posture (defined as dystonia) [36]. In comparison, IP₃R1 deletion specifically in PCs (L7-Cre; Itpr1<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice) triggers only severe ataxia and impaired motor learning [37]. The L7-Cre; Itpr1<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice also have numerous abnormally shaped PC spines on distal dendrites, due to the defective dissociation of F-actin and Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II subunit beta (CaMKIIβ) bundling through PKC-mediated phosphorylation [38]. These excess spines normally form synapses with PFs in a one-to-one ratio, which might explain the extremely severe ataxia observed in the L7-Cre; Itpr1<sup>flox/flox</sup> mice.

Because of these pivotal roles of IP₃R1 in cerebellar functions in rodents and the highly conserved homology between human and mouse primary IP₃R1 amino acid sequence (~98%), it is not surprising that IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signals are important for motor coordination in humans, and that genetic IP₃R1 mutations are associated with SCA. An IP₃R1 mutation was first found in patients with SCA15 in 2007 [29], and the number of reports of SCA patients harboring IP₃R1 mutations is gradually increasing (Figure 2) [39, 40]. Although only a few studies have investigated the functional effect of these mutations on IP₃R1, it is most likely that such mutations will affect IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling, since they are located at critical channel gating domains (Figure 2). In addition, the upstream and downstream molecules involved in IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling, such as mGluR1, transient receptor potential channel C3 (TRPC3), PKCγ, and IP₃R1-binding proteins have also been identified as causal genes for certain SCA subtypes (Figure 3). In this review, we summarize the recent research outcomes regarding human IP₃R1 mutations in SCA15 and SCA29 and the

effects of IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling alterations in several other SCA types.

### 1. SCAs caused by IP₃R1 genetic mutations

#### 1) SCA 15/16

SCA 15/16 is an adult-onset, slowly progressive, autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, which predominantly exhibits pure cerebellar ataxia [41] and is clinically characterized by truncal and limb ataxia, dysarthria, ocular movement abnormalities, and sometimes head and upper limb postural tremors. On brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), cerebellar atrophy is observed predominantly in the dorsal vermis of the cerebellum [29, 42-45].

In an attempt to map a cognate human disease in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor type 1 (ITPR1) genomic region, van de Leemput et al. (2007) discovered heterologous large deletions in the 5' prime end of the ITPR1 gene (exons 1-10, 1-40, and 1-44) in Australian and British SCA 15 families. Lymphoblasts from those patients had dramatically decreased IP₃R1 protein levels, as compared to unaffected members, suggesting an underlying pathological involvement of IP₃R1 in SCA 15. Thereafter, deletion of the entire ITPR1 gene in a Japanese family was also reported [46]. Although these patients have a partial deletion in the neighboring sulfatase-modifying factor 1 (SUMF1) gene in addition to ITPR1, a Japanese group subsequently reported that the affected Japanese patients only harbor the ITPR1 genomic region deletion, confirming that ITPR1 haploinsufficiency alone causes SCA 16/15 [47]. Since then, several studies identified the ITPR1 deletion in SCA 15/16 families of distinct ethnic groups, with the prevalence in Japanese populations being less than that in Caucasians [44, 45, 48-51].

Although SCA 15/16 patients generally harbor one heterozygous ITPR1 deletion, two heterozygous missense mutations, which are indicated in blue in Figure 2, have also been reported in a Japanese (P1059L: c1480G>A) and an Australian (V494I: c.8581C>T) affected family. The P1059L mutation is localized within the regulatory domain of IP₃R1. When a P1059L mutant form of IP₃R1 was stably expressed in

chicken IP₃R-deficient B lymphocytes, the mutant protein exhibited twice as high binding affinity to IP₃ than the wild-type. This was indicative of the enhanced Ca²⁺ signaling mediated by the mutant protein, as compared to wild-type IP₃R1. However, intracellular Ca²⁺ release from the mutant-expressing cells in response to B-cell receptor stimulation did not differ from that wild-type expressing cells in B lymphocytes [52]. It is possible that during the establishment of stable cell lines, changes in expression of other Ca²⁺-handling proteins might maintain cellular Ca²⁺ homeostasis and thus, counteract the aberrant Ca²⁺ signals mediated by the P1059L mutation. Moreover, since the regulatory domain is modulated by several molecular mechanisms, the surrounding environments around the P1059L IP₃R1 mutation might differ between lymphocytes and cerebellar PCs. Further analysis of the effects of the P1059L mutation on IP₃R1 expression and regulation in PCs is required for the better understanding of the P1059L pathogenesis.

The functional effect of the V494I mutation on IP₃R1 expression is unknown. The V494 is conserved among many species and the amino acid residue localizes within the binding region of IP₃R-binding protein released with IP₃ (IRBIT) (Figure 1), which decreases the IP₃ binding affinity of the receptor by competing with IP₃ for binding to IP₃R1 and reduces IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release [53, 54]. Therefore, it is highly possible that the V494I mutation might change the IP₃ and/or IRBIT affinity to IP₃R1, resulting in altered IP₃R-triggered Ca²⁺ signaling.

2) SCA29

SCA29 is an autosomal dominant neural disorder, which is caused by mutations in the ITPR1 gene. However, clinical features of SCA29 are clearly different from those of SCA15/16. In contrast to the adult-onset and progressive features of SCA15/16 patients, SCA29 patients present clinically with congenital-onset and non-progressive cerebellar ataxia [55, 56]. Delayed motor development and mild intellectual disability are also distinct features of SCA29, as compared to SCA15/16. Affected individuals also present

with additional cerebellar manifestations, including dysarthria, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, nystagmus, and cerebellar hypoplasia [55].

There have been increasing numbers of studies reporting novel IP3R1 missense mutations in SCA 29 patients. In 2012, Huang et al. performed whole exome sequencing in a Canadian and an Australian family and identified for the first time two missense mutations in each family: (a) the N602D in the IP3 binding domain and (b) the V1553M in the IP3R1 regulatory domain (Figure 2) [56]. Thereafter, many other mutations within the IP3 binding regions of IP3R1 (R241K, T267M, T267R, R269W, S277I, A280D, T594I) were reported in infantile-onset SCA 29 patients [57-60].

Although the Ca²⁺ releasing properties of these mutants have not been reported yet, the localization of these SCA 29-associated missense mutations within the IP3-binding region suggest possible changes in IP3R1 channel properties by affecting the binding affinity of IRBIT and/or IP3 [53, 54]. In addition, it is possible that the V1553M mutation modifies the Ca²⁺ releasing properties of IP3R1, since that amino acid residue lies within the carbonic anhydrase-related protein (CARP) binding region of IP3R1, which inhibits IP3 binding (Figure 1) [61]. CARP is a causal gene for waddles mouse, which is characterized by ataxia and appendicular dystonia [62], and is also associated with recessive congenital ataxia and mild mental retardation with or without quadrupedal gait [63, 64]. Thus, the V1553M mutation could change the affinity of IP3R1 to IP3, by modifying the CARP-IP3R1 binding, leading to aberrant Ca²⁺ signaling in cells.

Because many SCA 29-associated mutations were initially found in the IP3 binding domain, one may hypothesize that SCA 29 is closely associated to the missense mutations within the IP3 binding domain of IP3R1. However, recent accumulating evidence suggests a much wider distribution of SCA 29-associated mutations on the entire region of IP3R1, except for the COOH-terminal gate-keeper domain (Figure 2). These studies demonstrated missense mutations within the regulatory/coupling domain and the channel domain of IP3R1 [65-68]. Moreover, other types of mutations, such as

an in-frame ITPR1 insertion and splicing mutation, have also been detected in SCA 29 patients in a recent study [68, 69]. The splicing mutation is likely to skip the whole of exon 14 of IP3R1, resulting in a complete loss of IP3R1 function.

We have also identified a missense mutation (R36C) in the suppressor domain of IP3R1 in an affected SCA 29 Irish family, who presented with early motor delay, poor coordination, gait ataxia, dysarthria, and mild cognitive delay, but no cerebellar atrophy [70]. It is known that the suppressor domain lowers the IP3 binding affinity to the IP3-binding core region of the receptor and thus determines the specific affinities of three IP3R types to IP3, with IP3R2 > IP3R1 > IP3R3 being the affinity order. Without the suppressor region, all three IP3R types exhibit a similar affinity to IP3 [71]. Interestingly, the R36C mutation increases the affinity of IP3 binding to IP3R1 and changes the properties of intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling from transient to sigmoidal, when exogenously expressed in chicken B-cells (R23-11) [70]. To our knowledge, this is the only study that reported the functional properties of SCA 29-associated mutants. The data suggest that although the channel properties of the R36C and wild-type (WT) heterotetramers have not yet been analyzed, R36C is a gain-of-function mutation that causes SCA 29.

Although SCA 29 patients are clinically very heterogeneous, the clinical features are not clearly assigned to specific mutations in a particular IP3R1 domain. Zambonin et al. did not find any specific genotype-phenotype correlations in 21 individuals from 15 unrelated SCA 29 families [68]. Inter- and intra-family variations in clinical presentations of IP3R1 mutations also exist. In support of this, a Taiwanese individual harboring the V2574A missense mutation presented with adult-onset ataxia at 30 years of age, while her offspring presented with childhood-onset ataxia [72]. Different patients harboring the same missense mutation (G2539R) within the IP3R1 channel domain, present with SCA 29 [68] or Gillespie syndrome, a different type of neural disease with features of bilateral iris hypoplasia, congenital hypotonia, non-progressive ataxia, intellectual disability, and progressive cerebellar atrophy [73, 74]. Autosomal

recessive SCA 29 patients harboring missense mutations (L1820P) within the regulatory domain have also been reported [75]. In addition to IP3R1 genotyping, additional factors, perhaps including other genomic variations and living conditions, may modify the pathogenesis and progression of the individual variable clinical features of SCA 29.

2. Altered IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling associated with other SCA types

There are many studies that suggest the involvement of aberrant IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in the pathogenesis of several other SCA types [76-82]. One of the causal mechanisms leading to altered IP3R1 function involves the physical modulation of IP3R1 by SCA-related pathological proteins. Altered activity of other components in the IP3/Ca²⁺ signaling cascade can also cause dysregulated Ca²⁺ mobilization from IP3R1 in PCs. For instance, mGluR1 activation in response to repetitive PF stimulation activates PLC in PCs and the subsequent production of IP3 triggers IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release from the ER (Figure 3) [83]. Thus, enhancement or reduction of mGluR1 activity critically affects the IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ mobilization from the ER. This is clearly demonstrated in transgenic mouse models, which have deficient PC glutamate signaling. In mGluR1-deficient mice, Ca²⁺ release from IP3R1 in response to repetitive PF stimulation is diminished, and motor coordination as well as motor learning are impaired [84-86]. In addition, mice lacking PLCβ [87], Gαq [88, 89], and stromal interaction molecule 1 (STIM1) [90], two upstream or downstream IP3R1 signaling modulators, have impaired IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release and present with cerebellar ataxia and impaired motor learning. In the next section, we summarize the recent notions about the pathological mechanism involved in SCAs that are relevant to changes in IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in PCs.

2.1) SCA1

SCA1 is an autosomal dominantly inherited neural disease, which is pathologically characterized by atrophy and extensive PC loss. SCA1 patients present with progressive

loss of motor coordination, dysarthria, dysphagia, nystagmus, and hypotonia. The disease is caused by a polyglutamine (polyQ) repeat expansion (≥ 39) within the ataxin 1 protein (ATXN1<sup>polyQ</sup>), and PCs from SCA1 patients show extensive ATXN1<sup>polyQ</sup> aggregation in the nucleus. Transgenic SCA1 mouse models that express human ATXN1<sup>poly82Q</sup> under the PC-specific L7 promoter develop cerebellar ataxia and PC degeneration [91]. These mutant mice also have nuclear PC aggregates that are not required for SCA1 pathogenesis, since in a transgenic model where the nuclear localization signal is deleted, similar pathological and clinical phenotypes to ATXN1<sup>poly82Q</sup> mice, were observed. In support of this, *Scal*<sup>154Q</sup> knock-in mice, which have human ATXN1<sup>154Q</sup> in the endogenous mouse SCA1 locus [92], do not have ATXN1<sup>154Q</sup> nuclear PC aggregates until the advanced disease stage. Importantly, the ATXN1 mutation destabilizes the retinoid-related orphan receptor α (RORα), an important transcription factor for cerebellar development, and leads to the staggerer phenotype in RORα-deficient mice [93]. As a result, ATXN1<sup>polyQ82</sup> mice demonstrate a decrease in the expression of several proteins important for mGluR1/IP<sub>3</sub>R1 signaling, including IP<sub>3</sub>R1, sarcoplasmic/endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase 2 (serca2), type 1 inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase, transient receptor potential type 3 (TRPC3), and excitatory amino-acid transporter 4 (EAAT4), from two to four weeks of age [94, 95]. Homer-3 and CARP, both of which physically bind to IP<sub>3</sub>R1 and modulate IP<sub>3</sub>R1/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling [61, 96], are also down-regulated in the ATXN1<sup>polyQ82</sup> transgenic mice [97].

Although an initial study could not detect any critical differences in IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release upon repetitive PF stimulation in ATXN1<sup>polyQ82</sup> mice [31], a recent study clearly demonstrated local dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling deficits at PF-PC synapses, in addition to impaired synaptic plasticity (LTD) and synaptically-evoked suppression of excitation (SSE) [98, 99]. Moreover, mGluR1-mediated currents through TRPC3 were reduced [90] in ATXN1<sup>polyQ82</sup> mice between 5 and 12 weeks after birth [100]. This discrepancy may be due to methodological differences between the two studies, such as the Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators and microscopic apparatus used (see discussion in [100]).

Nevertheless, it is worth mentioning that in both studies, decreased expression of Ca²⁺ handling proteins and altered Ca²⁺ signaling in PCs following burst PF stimulation, were detected at 5 weeks of age, when motor deficits without major morphological alterations and PC death occur [94, 95]. Since the basic properties of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR)-mediated excitatory postsynaptic synaptic currents (EPSCs) of the PF-PC synapses are largely normal in the SCA1 model mice, these data imply that impaired mGluR1-mediated IP₃R1 signaling is one of the early SCA1 pathological events.

This hypothesis is further supported by lentiviral delivery of mutant SCA1 in adult WT mice, which eliminates the concern for the ATXN1polyQ82-associated developmental effects. Adult WT mice injected with GFP-ATXN1[Q76], but not with non-disease causing GFP-ATXN1[Q30] lentivirus, exhibit deterioration in the rotarod test, impaired LTD, SSE, and slow EPSCs, 8 weeks after infection, without any morphological PC abnormality [100]. In line with the finding that mGluR1 is tightly coupled to gamma-aminobutyric acid beta (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptors in PCs and that activation of GABA<sub>B</sub> receptors by baclofen potentiates slow EPSCs and ER Ca²⁺ release [101], baclofen treatment remarkably improved the motor performance of ATXN1polyQ82 transgenic mice and reversed SSE, LTD, and slow EPSCs [100].

Similar to ATXN1polyQ82 mice, another SCA1 model mouse, the heterozygous Sca1<sup>Q154/2Q</sup> knock-in model, also presents with defective mGluR1-mediated signaling [102]. This is emphasized by the decreased mGluR1 expression in PCs, and the long-lasting motor coordination improvement (for at least 6 days) following the subcutaneous injection of mGluR1 positive allosteric modulator (PAM), Ro0711401. Neuroadaptive changes, including spine morphology and Ser880 phosphorylation of GluA2, which are both associated with activity-dependent synaptic plasticity, were observed in the PAM-injected mice. This might explain the long-lasting motor improvement of the injected mice.

It has also been reported that staggerer mutant mice have decreased expression of

proteins involved in mGluR1-IP3R1/Ca²⁺ signaling, such as IP3R, Serca2a, and mGluR1 [95], and impairments in the mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs and SSE are also detected [103].

In contrast to these studies, E.M Power et al. reported prolonged mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs and local dendritic Ca²⁺ transients in the PCs of the ATXN1polyQ82 mutant mice, in response to repetitive PF stimulation [104]. Because the amplitudes of EPSC and Ca²⁺ signal were not different between control and mutant mice, and glutamate transporter inhibition did not increase the signals in the mutant mice, the loss of glutamate transporter activity, most likely EAAT4 [97], is responsible for the prolonged amplitude of both signals.

### 2.2) SCA2

SCA2 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disease, which is caused by a CAG repeat expansion within the ataxin-2 gene (ATXN2exp) [105]. The affected patients are clinically characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia, unstable gait, slow saccades, and dysarthria. Pathologically, cerebellar PCs are predominantly lost, but without apparent formation of ATXN2exp aggregates. The mechanistic insight of altered IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in the pathogenesis of SCA2 was first proposed by Bezprozvanny's group. They found that the mutant form of ataxin 2 (Atx2-58Q), but not WT Atx2, was specifically associated with the COOH-terminus of IP3R1 and increased the sensitivity of IP3R1 to IP3 [106], similar to the mutant form of Atx3 [107]. Cultured PCs derived from Atx2-58Q transgenic mice, which express a 58 polyQ extended form of the human Atx2 under the control of the PC-specific L7 promoter, exhibit enhanced IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release and pronounced cell death, as compared to WT PCs, upon mGluR stimulation. Importantly, Atx2-58Q mutant mice that were fed the Ca²⁺ stabilizer dantrolene, which inhibits ER Ca²⁺ release, from 2 to 11 months of age [108], experienced alleviation of PC degeneration and age-dependent ataxia. Furthermore, genetic overexpression by adeno-associated virus (AAV) of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate

5-phosphatase, which hydrolyzes the calcium-mobilizing IP₃ in PCs, alleviated the age-dependent motor incoordination and PC degeneration in the Atx2-58Q transgenic mouse model, demonstrating the critical role of increased Ca²⁺ signaling in SCA 2 pathogenesis.

PCs from SCA2-58Q mice have different electrophysiological properties, with reduced firing rates and irregular PC bursting patterns both in cerebellar slices [109] and in vivo [110]. The PC bursting activity in cerebellar slices from SCA2-58Q mice is restored to the regular tonic PC firing after oral administration of an activator for small-conductance calcium-activated potassium (SK) channels, together with neuronal degeneration in SCA2-58Q transgenic mice. [110]. Consequently, the SK modulator could be a possible drug for the treatment of SCA2 and possibly other SCA types. Nevertheless, the relationship between enhanced IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release in Atx2-58Q and the bursting PC firing patterns, as well as the precise drug target cells, should be further clarified.

It has also been reported that PCs in ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> mice, a mutant SCA2 mouse model that expresses a longer polyQ Atx2, exhibits earlier degenerative onset than SCA2-58Q mice, and larger mGluR1-mediated intracellular ER Ca²⁺ release and enhanced slow EPSPs in comparison to those from WT mice, upon repetitive PF stimulation [111]. This enhancement was likely dependent on the elevated basal cytosolic Ca²⁺ level in the PCs of the SCA2 mice, since it was abolished when internal free Ca²⁺ was buffered at a similar low level (~150 nM) between WT and ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> PCs ex vivo. The positive effects of slight Ca²⁺ elevations on TRPC3 [112] [113] and IP3R1 channel activities [114-117] are probably responsible for the enhancement of those signals. The mechanisms leading to elevated resting intracellular Ca²⁺ levels in ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> PCs are unknown, but changes in the expression levels of several genes associated with Ca²⁺ signaling, including calbindin (Calb1), Purkinje cell protein 2 (Pcp2), metabotropic glutamate receptor 1 (Grm1), and glutamate receptor, ionotropic, delta 2 (Grid2), might

lead to altered resting Ca²⁺ homeostasis in ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> PCs [118, 119]. Decreased PC firing rates have also been observed in ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> PCs at 6 weeks of age, much earlier than PC degeneration onset after ~12 weeks [118].

BAC-Q72 transgenic mice, which express human Atx2<sup>Q72</sup> under its native Atx2 promoter in a BAC clone, also show progressive reduction in the mRNA expression of several Ca²⁺ handling molecules, such as Pcp2, Calb1 and Grid2, similar to ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> mice [120]. Specifically, a significant decrease in the expression of the regulator of G-protein signaling 8 (RGS8) protein was observed in both BAC-Q72 and ATXN2<sup>Q127</sup> transgenic mice, prior to behavioral symptom onset. This was due to the lack of physical interaction between the mutant Atx2 and RGS8 mRNA during translation [120]. Since RGS8 negatively regulates G-protein signaling, the decrease of RGS8 expression might contribute to the enhanced mGluR1-IP₃R1 Ca²⁺ signaling observed in PCs of the SCA2 model. Decreased RGS8 protein levels have also been detected in lymphoblasts from SCA2 patients.

### 2.3) SCA3

SCA3 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, which is also known as Machado-Joseph disease. SCA3 is one of the most common world-wide inherited ataxias. It is a polyQ expansion disease and is caused by the CAG repeat expansion of the Atx3 gene. The patients are characterized by cerebellar ataxia, affecting gait, limb movements, dysarthria with a wide range of additional clinical manifestations including dystonia and ophthalmoplegia, which may be affected by the CAG repeat length and disease duration [121]. Similar to the polyQ-extended mutant form of Atx2 in SCA2, mutant forms of Atx3 interacts with IP₃R1 in a polyQ-length dependent manner and sensitize the opening of the channels by IP₃ [107]. This association is also detected in brain lysates from the SCA3 mouse model, SCA3-YAC-84Q [122]. Similar to

SCA 2-58Q transgenic mice, dantrolene alleviates motor incoordination and neuronal loss of pontine nuclei and substantia nigra neurons in SCA 3-YAC-84Q mice. Human fibroblasts from SCA 3 patients with 74Q-expanded Atx3 also show enhanced IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ increases in response to bradykinin stimulation, supporting the critical role of enhanced IP₃R-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in human SCA 3 [107].

In contrast, in another SCA 3 transgenic mouse model that specifically expresses Atx3 69Q in PCs [123], the expression of RORα is decreased and mGluR1-mediated SSE (retrograde suppression of glutamate release from PF terminals) is completely abolished [124]. Although Ca²⁺ signaling from IP₃R1 was not examined in this study, it could have been affected because mGluR1 expression was lost from the dendritic PC spines but was present in granule aggregates in the dendrites of the mutant mice [124]. This study also established the usefulness of the collapsing response mediator protein-associated molecule-associated guanosine triphosphatase (CRAG) expression, a molecule that facilitates the ubiquitin protease pathway, as a treatment regimen for SCA 3. CRAG expression cleared polyQ aggregates and restored the mGluR1-mediated SSE, dendritic PC morphology, as well as the motor performance of SCA3 mice [123, 124].

### 2.4) SCA 5

SCA 5 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder clinically characterized by gait limb ataxia and dysarthria. Symptoms include adult onset and slow progression with extensive cerebellar cortical atrophy and PC loss [125, 126]. The causal gene for SCA 5 is the one encoding for β-III spectrin (SPTBN2) [127], which is highly expressed in cerebellar PCs [128, 129] and stabilizes the glutamate transporter, excitatory amino-acid transporter 4 (EAAT4) to the plasma membrane [130]. A mutant form of β-III spectrin that has a 39bp deletion in the spectrin repeat domain cannot stabilize

EAAT4 and is likely to lead to failed glutamate transport from the soma to synaptic PC membranes in SCA 5 patients [127], suggesting elevated glutamate levels at the PF-PC synaptic clefts in SCA 5 patients. Mice lacking β-III spectrin exhibit gait abnormalities, PC loss, and cerebellar atrophy, similar to what is observed in clinical cases of SCA 5 [131, 132]. Moreover, they have decreased EAAT4 expression, reduced glutamate uptake into crude cerebellar membrane fractions, and altered PF-PC glutamatergic transmission [131]. In addition, EAAT4, but not glutamate/aspartate transporter (GLAST) or excitatory amino-acid carrier 1 (EAAC1) deficient mice, have larger amplitude and faster rising kinetics of PF-evoked mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs, than WT mice [133]. Although these observations were suggestive of the pathogenesis of SCA 5 being an EAAT4 dysfunction, EAAT4 destabilization is not likely to be a major motor incoordination cause for the onset of SCA 5, since EAAT4 deficient mice do not show ataxia.

In contrast, transgenic mice that express a human SCA 5 mutant form of β-III spectrin specifically in PCs, present with progressive motor deficits, cerebellar degeneration, and also with glutamatergic abnormalities in the PF-PC synapses. These include impaired mGluR1-mediated long-term potentiation (LTP) and decreased mGluR1/IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release upon high-frequency stimulation of presynaptic PFs in vivo [134]. These deficits are caused by mislocalization of mGluR1 at the dendritic spines of the SCA 5/β-III spectrin mutated PCs. Because mGluR1 protein levels are not affected in these mutant mice and because both WT and SCA 5 mutant form of β-III spectrin interact with mGluR1, deficits in mGluR1 membrane anchoring or transport to the dendritic spines via undetermined proteins, may result in mGluR1 mislocalization and altered mGluR1-IP3R1 signaling.

2.5) SCA 14

SCA14 is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, which is clinically characterized by slowly progressive motor incoordination of gait and limbs, dysarthria,

and nystagmus. The patients present with PC and cerebellar cortex degeneration. The causal gene for SCA14 is the protein kinase C gamma type (PRKCG) gene, which encodes for PKCγ [135, 136]. PKCγ is a serine/threonine kinase that belongs to the classical PKC isoforms within a large PKC family [137]. PKCγ is highly expressed in cerebellar PCs [138] and is involved in cerebellar development and function. PKCγ KO mice exhibit persistent multiple CF innervation and mild ataxia [34, 139]. The activity of PKCγ is controlled by two conserved domains, the diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding C1 domain and the Ca²⁺-binding C2 domain [137]. So far, many missense mutations or in-frame deletions have been identified in the PRKCG gene of SCA14 patients. The majority of them are located within the C1 domain of PKCγ with the exception of several mutations that are located within the C2 and kinase domain. The pathological mechanisms by which mutations within the PRKCG gene cause SCA14 are still unknown. The kinase activities of the SCA14 mutants are assay-dependent. Mutations in the C1 domain generally increase kinase activity in in-vitro kinase assays, but the mutants show decreased activity in biological assays with living cells. For example, the C1 domain mutants fail to phosphorylate and inactivate the channels [140], whereas WT PKCγ inhibits Ca²⁺ entry from TRPC3 channels by phosphorylation, in cells [141, 142]. The reduced affinity of these C1 mutants to DAG on the plasma membrane renders the mutants unable to efficiently attach to the membrane and inactivate TRPC3 by phosphorylation. PCs from mice lentivirally expressing the C1 mutant (S119P) of PKCγ, also have enhanced mGluR1-induced slow EPSCs via TRPC3 channels [143], possibly due to lack of TRPC3 inhibition by PKCγ-mediated phosphorylation. S119P mutant aggregate formation with endogenous WT PKCγ explains the dominant-negative effect of the mutation.

On the other hand, the S361G mutation in the kinase domain shows increased activity in vitro and strongly suppresses TRPC3 channels in cells [140]. S361GPKCγ transgenic mice present with mild ataxia and altered dendritic cerebellar PC morphology, just like cultured PCs treated with PKC activators [144]. It is certain that the pathological

mechanisms of SCA14 are complex since both gain-of-function and loss-of-function PKCγ mutations lead to similar phenotypes in SCA14 patients. Moreover, other factors such as aggregation and amyloid-like fibril formation of mutant PKCγ, which leads to impairments in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, ER stress, and eventually causes cell death, might be involved in SCA14 pathogenesis [145-148].

A recent study also suggested a close link between the aberrant PKC activities in PCs and the pathological mechanisms involved in the SCA1 and SCA2 mouse models. The enhanced PKC activities in both ATXN1<sup>82Q</sup> and ATXN2<sup>127Q</sup> mice have a protective effect on PC degeneration by reducing PC membrane excitability [149]. Since PKC phosphorylates various ion channels, including voltage-gated sodium channels, voltage-gated calcium channels, and potassium channels, in addition to TRPC3, regulation of these channels by PKC phosphorylation could underlie the changes in PC excitability and subsequent neuronal death in the SCA1 and SCA2 mouse models. Since PKC is regulated by IP<sub>3</sub>R1-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release in mouse PCs [38], altered IP<sub>3</sub>R1-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling might also result in disturbed PKC activity and TRPC3 PC currents in SCA15 and SCA29.

### 2.6) SCA41

SCA41 is a rare adult-onset autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by a mutation in the TRPC3 channel. TRPC3 is the most highly expressed TRPC channel isoform in cerebellar PCs. TRPC3 deficient mice exhibit poor motor performance with deficits in hind paw movement. In addition, synaptically evoked mGluR1-induced slow EPSCs are abolished [90], and LTD is impaired in TRPC3 deficient mice [150].

In 2015, Fogel et al., reported a heterozygous missense mutation (p.Arg762His) in the TRPC3 gene of SCA41 patients [151]. The mutation is localized within the highly conserved TRP domain of TRPC3, which is important for channel gating. The mutant

TRPC3 channel has increased activity, and cells expressing this form undergo neural cell death, probably due to sustained Ca²⁺ entry, suggesting that it is a gain-of-function mutation.

As mentioned above, TRPC3 channel activity is negatively regulated by PKCγ when heterologously expressed in cells [141, 142]. The importance of this PKC-mediated negative regulation is also observed in moonwalker (Mwk) mice, which harbor a gain-of-function mutation (T635A) within the conserved S4/S5 linker of TRPC3 [152]. In these mice, mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs are significantly enhanced in PCs, sustained Ca²⁺ entry causes a less elaborate dendritic arbor development and PCs eventually degenerate. Deficits in PKCγ phosphorylation in the Mwk TRPC3 could explain the enhanced mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs. However, PKCγ phosphorylation of TRPC3 in native cerebellar PCs has not been demonstrated and is still controversial [153]. Since TRPC3 determines PC spike frequencies [154], changes in TRPC3 activity might significantly compromise module-dependent PC excitabilities that might be necessary for the accurate control of coordinated movements.

### 2.7) SCAs associated with mGluR1 mutation

One of the most abundant mGluRs among the 8 brain subtypes is mGluR1, which is encoded by the GRM1 gene. As mentioned above, the binding of glutamate that is released from presynaptic terminals upon repetitive PF stimulation to mGluR1 is essential for the initiation of the signaling cascades responsible for IP₃R1-induced Ca²⁺ release and slow EPSCs, in PCs. The critical role of mGluR1 in the cerebellum has been extensively studied and demonstrated in genetically and spontaneously mutated animals. Mice lacking mGluR1 show impairments in motor coordination, synaptic plasticity (PF-PC synaptic LTD), memory and learning, as well as elimination of the CF-PC synapses [84, 85]. Recessive mGluR1 spontaneous mutations have also been reported in

recoil wobbler mice (mutations in the mGluR1 ligand region), cerebellet-4 mice (Grm1) disruption by a 190bp long terminal repeat fragment insertion in intron 4), and Coton de Tulear dogs (truncated retrotransposon insertion in Grml exon 8) [155], all of which present with early-onset cerebellar ataxia with no gross brain atrophy.

Similar to these animals, mGluR1 critically contributes to the cerebellar function in humans, which was first reported by a study demonstrating that patients with adult-onset cerebellar ataxia produce autoantibodies against mGluR1 [156]. The serum from these patients reacted with mGluR1 in the mouse brain, and IgG injection from the human serum into the cerebellar subarachnoid space in mice caused severe ataxia [156].

GRM1 mutations, although rare, have also been identified in humans. In 2012, the first GRM1 mutation was found in individuals from Roma patients with autosomal-recessive congenital cerebellar ataxia 13 (SCAR13) [157]. These patients presented with global developmental delay, infantile-onset of gait ataxia, dysarthria, dysmetria, and intellectual deficits, with progressive generalized cerebellar atrophy. The GRM1 human mutations include a deletion and an intron 8 splicing mutation (c.2652_2654del and c.2660+2T>G) in tandem, with aberrant transcripts presumed to skip exon 8 or end within intron 8. Since exon 8 encodes the transmembrane region, as well as part of the cytoplasmic tail of mGluR1, the mutations produce truncated nonfunctional receptors with or without wrong cytoplasmic tails. Because the cytoplasmic mGluR1 tail is important for mGluR1 synaptic localization, IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ mobilization, CF synapse elimination, and LTD induction [86], it is conceivable that these human SCAR13 mutations would profoundly affect mGluR1 function and downstream signaling, such as IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ release, thus leading to cerebellar ataxia.

An autosomal recessive GRM1 mutation was also identified in patients of a consanguineous Iranian family, who showed characteristics such as intellectual disability, developmental delay, and ataxia of stance and gait, along with cerebellar

atrophy [158]. The mutation was localized at the ligand binding domain of mGluR1 (c.1360C>T; p.Leu454Phe). Although functional examinations were not performed in this study, this evolutionary-conserved amino acid mutation may affect mGluR1 protein folding and/or the glutamate binding, leading to deranged mGluR1 signaling and ataxic gait.

Very recently, heterozygous dominant GRM1 mutations were also reported in the SCA 44 patients from three separate families [159]. The patients from family 1 and 2 presented with adult-onset, slowly progressive cerebellar ataxia with cerebellar atrophy, but they did not have cognitive impairments. The patients from family 1 had a missense GRM1 mutation, c.2375A>G (p.Tyr792Cys) within the transmembrane mGluR1 region, and the patients from family 2 had a c.785A>G (p.Thy262Cys) mutation in the ligand binding mGluR1 domain. Interestingly, both mutations are gain-of-function missense mutations and lead to elevated receptor activity, when heterologously expressed in cells. These enhanced receptor activities are abolished only in the presence of both competitive (MCPG) and non-competitive (BAY 367620) mGluR1 antagonists, suggesting the involvement of both ligand-dependent and ligand-independent activation mechanisms in the enhanced receptor activation.

In contrast to these patients, the ones from family 3 had a de novo GRM1 truncation mutation and presented with juvenile-onset ataxia and intellectual disability, with no apparent cerebellar atrophy. The patients had a heterozygous base pair duplication in GRM1 (c.3165dup; p.Gly1056Argfs*49) at the cytoplasmic mGluR1 tail. As a result, the mutant mGluR1 has a truncated cytoplasmic COOH-terminus, which is important for plasma membrane clustering via association with the scaffold protein Homer [160, 161], as well as for triggering IP3R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling [86, 96]. Consistent with this notion, the truncated mutant p.Gly1056Argfs*49 abolishes Homer2b-mediated mGluR1 clustering and also decreases ERK1/2 phosphorylation [159]. Perhaps, defects in

mGluR1 signaling, including Ca²⁺ release from IP₃R1 and mGluR1-mediated slow EPSCs, might also contribute to the clinical phenotypes of these patients.

# Concluding Remarks

IP₃R1 is highly expressed in cerebellar PCs and plays a critical role in the synaptic plasticity of the PF-PC synapse, dendritic development, spine maintenance in mature PCs, motor coordination, as well as learning in mice. Malfunctioning PCs in mutant IP₃R1 mice lead to severe ataxia and inability to walk. In humans, deletions or point mutations within the *ITPR1* gene cause SCA15/16 or SCA29. Though the functional effects of these mutations remain unclear, it is likely that they might compromise the activity of the IP₃R1 channel due to their existence within functional domains necessary for channel gating and modulation by IP₃R1-binding proteins, such as IRBIT and CARP. Recent studies have been extensively analyzing the IP₃R1 structure and its allosteric modulation by IP₃ and Ca²⁺ [15, 19-21, 23, 25-27]. Information of the relationships between IP₃R1 mutations and their effects on the allosteric conformational changes of IP₃R1 for channel gating will open a new avenue for understanding the pathogenesis of SCA15/16 and SCA29.

In several other SCA types, mutations in SCA-related genes result in deranged Ca²⁺ homeostasis in PCs with altered IP₃R1 activities. The mechanisms that are responsible for the altered IP₃R1 activity are largely divided into two major categories: (a) aberrant IP₃R1 modulation by SCA-associated genes and (b) hyper- or hypo-activity of mGluR1, a critical upstream molecule of IP₃R1. As a result, deranged IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling would profoundly affect PKC activity in PCs, which presumably influences TRPC3 activity through phosphorylation. Thus, any disruption in the signaling events that lead to or originate from IP₃R1-mediated Ca²⁺ signaling in PCs could be a pathological cause of SCA.

Recent studies demonstrated the parasagittal PC compartmentalization in the cerebellum in vivo, through the restricted expression patterns of various molecular markers such as zebrin II [162, 163]. Importantly, several molecules that are involved in glutamate transmission in PCs are also expressed in stripe patterns aligned with zebrin II; mGluR1b, PLCβ3 and β4, IP₃R1, and EAAT4 are expressed in the zonal patterns in the cerebellum [164-168]. The significance of these PC strips in cerebellar functions, such as motor coordination and learning is completely unknown, but PC subpopulations in distinct strips show different properties in terms of PC firing rates and CF innervations, and LTD and LTP efficacies at the PF-PC synapse [167, 169-172]. It is of interest to correlate with the present strips with the formation of the PC stripes in the cerebellar cortex formed in a birthday specific manner, which is discovered by pulse labeling of PC at several embryonic stages [173, 174]. Therefore, changes in the expression or activity of SCA-related genes, which are involved in mGluR1/PLC/IP₃R1 signaling, would disrupt the distribution of parasagittal PC compartmentalization. In turn, this might activate the wrong processing and efferent signals from the cerebellum, causing cerebellar ataxia. Further studies on the association between SCA genetic mutations, Ca²⁺ signaling, and PC properties in distinct cerebellar strands should be performed to fully understand the pathological mechanisms contributing to SCA.

Figure legends

Figure 1. Structure of IP₃R1 and IP₃R1 binding protein's sites

(A) IP₃R1 is composed of five functional domains, including the suppressor domain, the IP₃ binding domain, the regulatory/coupling domain, the transmembrane domain, and the gatekeeper domain. The positions of the amino acid deletions in Δ18 and opt mice are depicted as black boxes. Binding regions of IRBIT, CARP, polyQ-ataxin 2, and polyQ-ataxin 3 are also indicated. Amino acid positions are numbered according to the mouse IP₃R1 protein sequence of accession number NP_034715.3 and are described in the parentheses. SD: suppressor domain; IBC: IP₃ binding core; HD: helix domain. The red region indicates the leaflet structure that is critical for channel gating upon IP₃ binding. (B) The 3D structure of IP₃R1 and the IP₃R1 binding sites for IRBIT, CARP, and Ataxin-2/3 PolyQ. The ribbon colors correspond to those of the functional domains depicted in (A). The dot square indicates the CARP binding site. The opt deletion site is also shown. The atomic structure of IP₃R is built by fitting of the X-ray crystal structure (PDB ID: 5X9Z) to the cryo-EM map (EMDB-6369) and by clipping of channel and gatekeeper domains from the cryo-EM structure (PDB ID: 3JAV). Two subunits were presented to be simplified.

Figure 2. Mutations of IP₃R1 in SCA15/16, SCA29, and ataxic cerebral palsy (CP) and pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH)

Deletions of the *Itprl* gene in SCA15/16 are not shown. The L1820P mutation in SCA29 is an autosomal recessive mutation, and others are autosomal dominant mutations. Amino acid positions are numbered according to the human IP₃R1 protein sequence of accession number NP_001161744.

Figure 3. IP₃R1-associated signaling in the Paralell fiber-Purkinje cell synapse and its relationship with several SCA types

Stimulation of mGluR1 (a causal gene for SCA44) produces IP₃ through PLC activation, which binds to IP₃R1 and releases Ca²⁺ from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). PLC also produces diacylglycerol (DG) and activates protein kinase C (PKC, a causal gene for SCA14) together with Ca²⁺ released from IP₃R1. PKC is likely to suppress the activity of TRPC3 (a causal gene for SCA41) by phosphorylation. Also, intracellular Ca²⁺ elevation promotes the TRPC3 activity. IP₃R1 is a causal gene for SCA15/16 and

SCA 29, and its activity is potentiated by polyQ extended ataxin 2 or 3 (SCA 2/3) by increasing the sensitivity to IP₃. IRBIT and CARP (a causal gene for CAMRQ3) may suppress the IP₃R1 activities in PCs by lowering the affinity to IP₃.

Highlights:
- IP₃R1 is highly expressed in cerebellar PCs and is essential for motor and sensory coordination
- IP₃R1 is a causal gene for human SCA 15/16 and SCA 29
- Aberrant Ca²⁺ release from IP₃R1 in PCs is associated with several other types of SCA
