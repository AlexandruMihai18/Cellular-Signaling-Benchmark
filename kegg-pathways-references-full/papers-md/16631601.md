### Abstract

M-LP (Mpv17-like protein) is a protein that was initially identified in mouse tissues and shows high sequence homology with Mpv17 protein, a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis [R. Iida, T. Yasuda, E. Tsubota, H. Takatsuka, M. Masuyama, T. Matsuki, K. Kishi, M-LP, Mpv17-like protein, has a peroxisomal membrane targeting signal comprising a transmembrane domain and a positively charged loop and up-regulates expression of the manganese superoxide dismutase gene, J. Biol. Chem. 278 (2003) 6301–6306]. Here we report the identification and characterization of a human homolog of the M-LP (M-LPH) gene. The M-LPH gene is composed of four exons, extends over 14 kb on chromosome 16p13.1, and is expressed as two alternatively spliced variants comprising four and three exons, respectively, which include open-reading frames encoding two distinct isoforms composed of 196 (M-LPH1) and 147 (M-LPH2) amino acids, respectively. These two variants were expressed ubiquitously in human tissues, however only M-LPH1 was detected at the protein level. Dual-color confocal analysis of COS-7 cells transfected with a green fluorescent protein-tagged M-LPH1 demonstrated that M-LPH1 is localized in peroxisomes. In order to elucidate the function of M-LPH1, we examined the mRNA levels of several enzymes involved in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species in COS-7 cells and found that transfection with M-LPH1 down-regulates expression of the plasma glutathione peroxidase and catalase genes. These results show the existence of the human homolog of M-LP and its participation in reactive oxygen species metabolism.

Mpv17-like protein (M-LP) has been newly identified as a protein expressed in mouse tissues [1,2] that shows high sequence homology with Mpv17 protein, a peroxisomal membrane protein involved in the development of early-onset glomerulosclerosis and neurosensory deafness [3,4]. Although the molecular functions of the Mpv17 protein have yet to be elucidated, it has recently been suggested that it participates in the metabolism of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and that glomerular damage is due to over-production of ROS [5–7].

The mouse M-LP gene is composed of five exons, extends over a 19-kb region on chromosome 16, and is expressed as two distinct splicing transcripts [8]. The original isoform M-LP${}_{L}$, encoded by exons 2, 3, 4, and 5, is composed of 194 amino acid residues including a peroxisomal membrane targeting signal (mPTS) and four transmembrane segments (TMSs), and is integrated into the peroxisomal membrane [2,8,9]. The subsequently identified isoform M-LP${}_{S}$, encoded by exons 1, 3, 4, and 5, lacks the N-terminal half of M-LP${}_{L}$ that contains mPTS and three TMSs out of four, and is localized to the cytosol [8]. M-LP${}_{L}$ mRNA is expressed ubiquitously, whereas M-LP${}_{S}$ is expressed specifically in the kidney [8,9]. To investigate whether the M-LP isoforms, as well as the

Mpv17 protein, are involved in ROS metabolism, COS-7 cells were transfected with either M-LP<sub>L</sub> or M-LP<sub>S</sub> and the mRNA levels of several enzymes involved in antioxidant defense systems were examined. Consequently, it was demonstrated that transfection with M-LP<sub>L</sub> up-regulates expression of the mitochondrial manganese superoxide dismutase (SOD2) gene [9], whereas transfection with M-LP<sub>S</sub> up-regulates expression of the SOD2 gene and down-regulates expression of the cellular glutathione peroxidase (Gpx1) and plasma glutathione peroxidase (Gpx3) genes [8]. These features strongly suggest that both isoforms participate in ROS metabolism in a manner similar to the Mpv17 protein, although they are likely to be generated by the use of distinct promoters and play different roles. The Mpv17 gene is a recessive kidney disease gene in mouse, and Mpv17 gene-inactivated mice show symptoms that resemble human glomerulosclerosis. Therefore, to evaluate the role of the M-LP gene in detail, comparative studies may yield insight into the mechanism of human kidney diseases. The aims of this study were, first, to identify the human homolog of M-LP and confirm its cellular localization, and second, to investigate whether there is a connection between the homolog and ROS metabolism.

### Materials and methods

#### Construction of M-LPH cDNAs
The full-length cDNA of M-LPH was constructed by a RACE method using the SMART RACE cDNA amplification kit (BD Biosciences, Palo Alto, CA). Each first-strand cDNA for the 5′- and 3′-RACE reaction was synthesized from 0.5 μg of human kidney poly(A<sup>+</sup>) RNA (BD Biosciences, pooled from six individuals, aged 28–52 years) using SuperScript II RNase H− reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). The gene-specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE were designed on the basis of the *Homo sapiens* chromosome 16 genomic contig sequence (GenBank Accession No. NT_010393.15) so that each RACE product would overlap, as follows: antisense primer for 5′-RACE, HRA-2, 5′-AAACAGATGAAGGTGGCCCAGAGAAAAC-3′ (positions 6814954–6814927 of NT_010393.15); sense primer of 3′-RACE, HRS-2, 5′-AGTGGACTGATGTGGCCCTTT-3′ (positions 6814760–6814783 of NT_010393.15). The RACE products were subcloned into TA cloning vector pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) and sequenced. The M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 cDNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank with the Accession Nos. DQ004255 and DQ004256. Prediction of amino acid sequences for the cDNA sequence was performed using ORF Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gorf/gorf.html).

#### Cells and transfections
COS-7 cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium containing 1 mM L-glutamine, 50 U/ml penicillin, 50 μg/ml streptomycin, and 10% (v/v) fetal calf serum (Invitrogen), and were transiently transfected with TransFectin Lipid reagent (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Normal human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells (RPTEC) were purchased from Cambrex Bio Science (Walkersville, MD) and maintained according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

#### Expression vectors for M-LPH1
All the primers used in this study for expression vector construction are listed in Table 1. A DNA fragment encoding full-length M-LPH1 was created by PCR amplification using the primer set exMLPH-S/exMLPH1-A and the first-strand cDNA synthesized using human kidney poly(A<sup>+</sup>) RNA as the template. The PCR product was cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of pcDNA3.1 (the resulting vector was designated pcDNA3.1/MLPH1).

The expression vector for C-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged MLPH1 (M-LPH1-GFP) was prepared as follows. The GFP gene

was PCR-amplified using the primer set exGFPS/exGFPA and pEGFP (BD Biosciences) as the template, and the PCR product was cloned into the *Eco*RI/*Bam*HI sites of pcDNA3.1 (the resulting vector was designated pcDNA3.1/GFP). A DNA fragment encoding full-length M-LPH1 was created by PCR amplification using the primer set locMLPH1-S/locMLPH1-A and pcDNA3.1/MLPH1 as the template, and then the PCR product was cloned into the *Nhe*I/*Hind*III sites of pcDNA3.1/GFP, which contains the coding sequence of GFP behind the *Nhe*I/*Hind*III sites. The expression vector for a peroxisomal marker, DsRED-PTS1, was prepared according to our previous paper [9].

**Subcellular localization analysis.** COS-7 cells were plated in 3.5-cm poly-D-lysine-coated glass-bottomed dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA). One day after co-transfection with MLPH1-GFP and DsRED2-PTS1, fluorescent images were analyzed with a TCS SPII laser scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Tokyo, Japan). A 488 nm Ar laser and a 543 nm He–Ne laser were used for excitation of GFP and DSRED2, respectively.

**Measurement of mRNA levels.** The mRNA levels of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 expressed in human kidney and of the 6 enzymes involved in ROS metabolism expressed in COS-7 cells transfected with pcDNA3.1/MLPH1 were determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis with an ABI PRISM 7700 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) and the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

The gene-specific primers used for the measurement of M-LPH1 mRNA were: sense primer M-LPHN-S (5′-GTATGAGCATTCT CCAAGGAAAGGAT-3′, positions 455–480 of DQ004255) and antisense primer HRA-1 (5′-TGAATGTGCCGTCA CCACTCTGCT-3′, positions 670–647 of DQ004255). Those for the measurement of M-LPH2 mRNA were: sense primer M-LPHC-S (5′-GTATGAGCATTCTCCAAG GAAAGGAT-3′, positions 441–464 of DQ004256) and antisense primer HRA-2 (5′-AAACAGATGAAGGTGGCCCAGAGAAAAC-3′, positions 570–543 of DQ004256). The standard curves for absolute quantification of the copy numbers of the transcripts for M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 were created by analyzing serial dilutions of plasmid DNAs inserted with the target PCR products.

One day after transfection, total RNA in COS-7 cells was extracted using Sepasol-RNA I Super (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The amount of mRNA was normalized to the internal control, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). The primers for SOD2, Gpx1, Gpx3, and catalase (CAT) were those described in our previous paper [9] and the sequences of the primers used for measurement of SOD1, SOD3, or GAPDH mRNA were: SOD1, 5′-TGGTCCATGAAAAAGCAGAT-3′ and 5′-TTCCAGCGTTT CCTGCTTTG-3′; SOD3, 5′-GCGGAGCCCCA ACTCTGACT-3′ and 5′-GC ATGACCTCCTGCCAGATC-3′; GAPDH, 5′-CCACCCATGGGCAA ATTCC-3′ and 5′-GATGGGATT TCCATTGATGAC-3′.

**Expression analysis of M-LPH gene transcripts by Northern blotting and RT-PCR.** One microgram of human kidney poly(A<sup>+</sup>) RNA was fractionated on 1% agarose gels in the presence of 2.2 M formaldehyde and transferred to nylon membranes (Hybond N1; Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Buckinghamshire, UK). The probe was a 1900-bp fragment of M-LPH2 cDNA labeled with fluorescein using a Random Prime Labeling Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). Primers used for M-LPH2

cDNA amplification were as follows: FHM-S2, 5′-TACGTGTGG CTGCCGCTGCTG-3′, positions 334–354 of DQ004256; FHM-A2, 5′- GAGCAACATGGCTGTTTATTCACC-3′, positions 2233–2209 of DQ004256. Hybridization was performed in UltraHyb (Ambion, Austin, TX) at 42°C for 16 h. The membrane was washed twice with 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 5 min and twice with 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 42°C for 15 min. The bands were visualized using a CDP-Star Detection Module (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech).

Primer sets used for detection of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 transcripts in human kidney and RPTEC by RT-PCR were FHM-S1/FHM-A2, MLPHN-S/HRA-1, and MLPHC-S/HRA-2. The sequence of FHM-S1 was 5′-AATCGCTCCGGAGCTTCTGGA-3′, positions 1–21 of DQ004255.

Tissue distribution analysis was performed with a set of normalized first-strand cDNAs (Human Multiple Tissue cDNA panels I and II, BD Biosciences) and sets of specific primers MLPHN-S/HRA-1, for M-LPH1, and MLPHC-S/HRA-2, for M-LPH2, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Generation of anti-M-LPH antibodies. Peptide antibodies against M-LPH were generated from a commercial source (Genscript, Piscataway, NJ) and purified by a peptide affinity column on which the same peptide antigen was immobilized. The peptides contained N-terminal cysteine and residues 68–81 of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 as follows: CRLLERALPGRAPHA.

Western blotting. The normal human RPTEC cultured on a 90-mm dish (90% confluent) were washed with phosphate-buffered saline on ice and harvested by scraping into 1 ml of the same buffer, followed by centrifugation. The precipitated cells were mixed with 200 μl of 0.125 M Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) containing 4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.01% (w/v) bromphenol blue, heated at 100°C for 5 min, and subjected to 14% SDS-PAGE according to the method of Laemmli [10]. After electrophoresis, the proteins were transferred to an Immobilon-P membrane (Millipore, Bedford, MA) using an electroblotting apparatus (Oriental Instruments, Tokyo, Japan). The filter was blocked with 0.5% non-fat dried milk in PBS-T (80 mM Na₂HPO₄, 20 mM NaH₂PO₄, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween 20) and treated with anti-M-LPH as the primary antibody and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated rabbit secondary antibody against goat IgG (Bio-Rad) as a secondary antibody. The signals were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence system (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ).

Results and discussion

Identification of the gene for the human M-LP homolog

In order to identify the M-LPH gene, we performed a TBLASTN search (NCBI) of the human genome database using the M-LP_L protein sequence as a query and identified a chromosome 16 genomic contig with the GenBank Accession No. NT_010393, which contained a partial open-reading frame (ORF) showing high homology to the amino-terminal region of M-LP_L. To obtain the complete ORF, the RACE method was employed using human kidney poly(A⁺) RNA as the template, and 5′-RACE products of two different sizes (600 and 671 bp) and a 3′-RACE product (1834 bp) were obtained. A comparison of NT_010393 and the sequences of the 5′- and 3′-RACE products indicated that the M-LPH gene is composed of four exons, extends over 14 kb on chromosome 16p13.1, and is expressed as two alternatively spliced variants (Fig. 1). The full-length cDNA of the longer transcript (M-LPH1) was predicted to be composed of 2304 bp (exons 1, 2, 3, and 4) including an ORF of 591 nucleotides (196 amino acids), whereas the shorter transcript (M-LPH2) comprised 2233 bp (exons 1, 3, and 4) including an ORF of 444 nucleotides (147 amino acids), showing that exon 2 is alternatively spliced. The predicted amino acid sequences of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 differ in their C-terminal regions starting from residue 104, since splicing of exon 2 results in alteration of the sequence due to a frame-shift (Fig. 2). Sequence comparison with human and mouse M-LP isoforms revealed that the N-terminal 188 amino acids of M-LPH1 show high homology (79.8% identity and 96.3% similarity) with M-LP_L, the mouse long isoform localized in peroxisomes.

Fig. 1. Organization of the M-LPH gene. The M-LPH gene is localized on human chromosome 16 and consists of four exons: exon 1 corresponds to positions 6802690–6803143 (454 bp) of the contig NT_0010393.15, exon 2 to 6807723–6807793 (71 bp), exon 3 to 6814760–6814789 (30 bp), and exon 4 to 6814869–6816617 (1749 bp). The diagrams below the genomic structure illustrate the contribution of exons to M-LPH1 and M-LPH2, respectively. The black arrows represent the sites of gene-specific primers for 5′- and 3′-RACE, and the white arrows represent those for confirmation of the expression of the alternatively spliced transcripts. Since splicing of exon 2 results in a frame-shift, the predicted amino acid sequences of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 differ in their C-terminal regions.

Fig. 2. Comparison of amino acid sequences of the human M-LP isoforms (M-LPH1, M-LPH2) and the mouse M-LP isoforms (M-LPL and M-LPS). Identical amino acids are indicated by vertical strokes and similar residues by dots. The peroxisomal membrane-targeting signal identified in mouse M-LP in our previous study [9] is enclosed with a rectangle and the amino acids contained in the peptide used to generate the peptide antibody are underlined. The C-terminal region of M-LPH2, which is quite different from M-LPH1 due to a frame-shift, is shaded.

In our previous study of mouse M-LP [8], we newly identified an additional exon approximately 10 kb upstream from the original first exon that corresponds to human exon 1, and confirmed the existence of the transcript including the newly identified exon, which encodes the cytosolic isoform (M-LPS). Therefore, in order to ascertain whether or not a similar transcript exists in human, we performed 5'-RACE analysis using several gene-specific primers and analyzed the PCR products obtained in detail. However, no additional 5'-RACE product corresponding to the objective transcript was detected. One explanation for this result is to assume that the cytosolic form of M-LP is expressed specifically in mouse, and another is that the expression level of the objective transcript in the human sample was too low to detect.

**Confirmation of expression of the M-LPH variants at the RNA and protein levels**

First, the existence of the M-LPH transcripts was validated by Northern blot analysis. A relatively broad band was detected in poly(A+) RNA prepared from whole kidneys pooled from six individuals (aged 22–52 years) and the size of the band (approximately 2.8 kb) was consistent with the expected sizes of both transcripts (Fig. 3A).

Next, in order to confirm the existence of each alternatively spliced variant, we performed RT-PCR using sets of specific primers and cDNA derived from human kidneys or from normal human renal cells (RPTEC) as the template. Primer MLPHN-S is specific for M-LPH1 because it anneals to a sequence localized within exon 2, whereas MLPHC-S is specific for M-LPH2 because it anneals to an area extending over exons 1 and 3 (Fig. 1). Whichever cDNA was used as the template, PCR products of the expected sizes (FHM-S1/FHM-A2, 2304 and 2233 bp; MLPHN-S/HRA-1, 216 bp; MLPHC-S/HRA-2, 130 bp)

were amplified (Fig. 3B), indicating that both variants exist, at least at the RNA level. Next, the expression levels of the two alternatively spliced variants in human kidneys and in RPTEC were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The copy numbers of the transcripts for M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 in human kidney were (4.4 ± 0.08) × 10³ and (8.1 ± 0.17) × 10³ molecules/µg total RNA, and those in RPTEC were (1.2 ± 0.05) × 10⁴ and (1.8 ± 0.01) × 10⁴ molecules/µg total RNA, respectively. Therefore, the levels of the transcripts for M-LPH1 were calculated to be 0.54 and 0.67 times as much as those for M-LPH2 in human kidney and in RPTEC, respectively.

Moreover, expression of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 at the protein level in normal human renal cells was examined by Western blotting using a specific peptide antibody against 14 amino acid residues included in both isoforms (see Fig. 2). As shown in Fig. 3C, a distinct band was detected in total protein extracted from RPTEC. The size of the band fitted well with the expected size of M-LPH1 (22,114 Da), but no band corresponding to M-LPH2 (16,725 Da) was detected (Fig. 3C), suggesting that the major product under normal physiological conditions is M-LPH1.

**Tissue distribution of the two alternatively spliced variants**

To examine the tissue distribution pattern of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2, we performed RT-PCR with a set of normalized cDNAs from 16 different human tissues (Fig. 4). Both M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 are expressed ubiquitously, and abundant expression was observed in heart, kidney, liver, lung, pancreas, and skeletal muscle. In our previous studies, we had demonstrated that mouse M-LPL is expressed relatively ubiquitously, and is especially abundant in kidney and spleen, whereas M-LPS is expressed only in kidney [8,9]. Therefore, it follows from all these

Hybridization was carried out with a 1900-bp fragment of M-LPH2 cDNA (positions 334–2233). (B) Detection of the two alternatively spliced transcripts of the M-LPH gene. PCR was performed using three sets of specific primers (lanes 1 and 4, FHM-S1/FHM-A2; lanes 2 and 5, MLPHN-S/HRA-1; lanes 3 and 6, MLPHC-S/HRA-2; see Fig. 1) and cDNA derived from human kidneys (lanes 1–3) and RPTEC (lanes 4–6) as the templates. PCR-amplified products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis. (C) Western blot analysis of proteins from normal human renal proximal tubule epithelial cells. Detection of the M-LPH isoforms was performed with a peptide antibody against residues 68–81 of M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 (CRLLEERALPGRAPHA) and then with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat secondary antibodies against rabbit IgG.

Tissue distribution of the M-LPH variants was analyzed by RT-PCR using multiple tissue cDNA panels (lanes 1, brain; 2, heart; 3, kidney; 4, liver; 5, lung; 6, pancreas; 7, placenta; 8, skeletal muscle; 9, spleen; 10, thymus; 11, prostate; 12, testis; 13, ovary; 14, small intestine; 15, colon; and 16, peripheral blood leukocytes). Expression of GAPDH is shown in the lower panel.

results that both M-LPH1 and M-LPH2 exhibit a similar tissue-distribution pattern to mouse M-LPₗ. These results are compatible with the structural similarity between M-LPH1 (or 2) and mouse M-LPₗ.

**Localization of M-LPH1 to peroxisomes**

To determine the subcellular localization of M-LPH1, the major product of the M-LPH gene at the protein level, COS-7 cells were co-transfected with GFP-tagged M-LPH1 and DsRED2-PTS1, a red fluorescent peroxisomal marker. As shown in Fig. 5, punctate green fluorescence was observed in MLPH1-expressing cells and was superimposable on the red fluorescence due to DsRED2-PTS1, demonstrating clearly that M-LPH1 was targeted to peroxisomes. In our previous study, we had constructed several deletion mutants of M-LPₗ and demonstrated that the peroxisomal targeting signal of M-LPₗ was located within residues 16–55 [9]. Considering the high homology between M-LPₗ and M-LPH1 in this region (80.0% identity, 92.5% similarity), it seems quite reasonable that M-LPH1 is localized in peroxisomes.

**Decreases of Gpx3 and CAT mRNA in COS-7 cells transfected with M-LPH1**

To investigate whether transfection with M-LPH1 has some effect on the expression of antioxidant enzymes, the mRNA levels of six enzymes involved in ROS metabolism (SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, Gpx1, Gpx3, and CAT) in COS-7 cells transfected with M-LPH1 were examined by quantitative real-time PCR. The decreases in the expression levels of Gpx3 and CAT (0.69 and 0.71 ratio relative to control cells, respectively) were statistically significant (Fig. 6). These results suggested that, like the mouse M-LP isoforms, M-LPH1 participates in ROS metabolism. In mouse, it has been observed that transfection with M-LPₗ up-regulates expression of the SOD2 gene, whereas

Fig. 6. mRNA levels of enzymes involved in ROS metabolism in COS-7 cells transfected with M-LPH1. The mRNA levels of SOD1, SOD2, SOD3, Gpx1, Gpx3, and CAT in cells expressing M-LPH1 (*n* = 4) were determined by quantitative real-time PCR analysis. The results are expressed as ratios relative to the value for control cells transfected with pcDNA3.1 (*n* = 4). The decreases in the Gpx3 levels (*p* = 0.023) and in the CAT level (*p* = 0.021) were evaluated as statistically significant by Student’s *t* test.

intracellular messengers in various biological processes [13–15]; in particular, H₂O₂ has been reported to be a second messenger for various physiologically active agents, such as angiotensin [16], transforming growth factor-β [17,18], and epidermal growth factor [19]. In order to fully understand the range of functions of ROS, it is indispensable to clarify the molecular mechanism responsible for regulating the intracellular levels of ROS. Recently, several groups have reported multiple cis- and/or trans-elements involved in regulation of the SOD2, Gpx3, and CAT genes at the transcriptional level [20–24]. Furthermore, it has been suggested that a series of detoxifying and antioxidant genes are consistently regulated through the Keap1-Nrf2 signaling pathway [25]. Although further studies are required to evaluate the precise mechanism involved, it seems reasonable to assume that the M-LP family participates in regulating the intracellular levels of ROS though up- or down-regulation of the genes of antioxidant enzymes.
