Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an organ-specific autoimmune disease in which the insulin-producing β cells in the pancreatic islets are selectively eliminated. T cells specific for β-cell antigens are the mediators of this precise cellular destruction. However, antibodies to β-cell proteins are also generated and may be used for predicting disease in at-risk populations. Over the past two decades, numerous β-cell proteins and lipids have been implicated as autoantigens in patients or in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, a well-studied animal model of T1D. Here, we present a review of these antigens, accompanied by their T-cell epitopes, where known, and a discussion of our current understanding of why particular self-proteins become disease-inciting antigens. Although two dozen β-cell antigens have been identified to date, few of these have been confirmed to be recognized by pathogenic T cells early in the disease process. Further identification and characterization of initiating β-cell antigens targeted by pathogenic T cells should be a priority for future studies.

Type 1 diabetes (T1D), formerly designated juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent diabetes, was first suspected to have an autoimmune etiology approximately 40 years ago when an association was noted between diabetes and recognized autoimmune diseases (1, 2). Histological findings of an inflammatory pancreatic infiltrate (insulitis) in young patients also suggested the possibility that the observed islet β-cell disappearance was due to an autoimmune reaction (3). In 1974, the use of indirect immunofluorescence of frozen human pancreas sections revealed the existence of circulating islet cell antibodies (ICA) in diabetes patients with coexistent autoimmune disease (4). Nearly concomitantly, an association was reported between certain histocompatibility antigens and diabetes, thus suggesting that the observed autoimmune pathology was under genetic control (5). The report that ICA could precede diabetes development by years (6) stimulated a search to identify the specific antigens targeted in T1D. In the nearly 30 years following these seminal observations, humoral and cellular immunity has been documented to a host of

β-cell proteins (Table 1), and B- and T-cell epitopes have been mapped for some of these. This review charts the progress of β-cell antigen identification studies and discusses how this progress is leading to an understanding of why particular self-proteins become tissue antigens for disease-inducing autoimmune responses.

Antibody responses to β-cell antigens

Humans

Proinsulin and insulin

The first known β-cell protein to which an autoimmune response was documented in T1D patients was insulin (7). The mature insulin molecule consists of an A and B chain covalently linked by two disulfide bonds (Fig. 1). It is processed from the single-chain precursor preproinsulin by removal of the leader peptide, two endoproteolytic cleavages which excise the C-peptide region, and subsequent trimming of the B chain by carboxypeptidase E (CPE). As a humoral immune response to mature insulin was known to develop in patients treated with insulin, newly diagnosed patients were examined for the presence of antibodies to insulin before the initiation of insulin therapy. Eighteen percent of patient sera demonstrated elevated binding to insulin compared to normal controls. More recently, the use of an improved assay revealed that nearly 70% of new-onset patients have circulating antibodies to insulin (8). Antibodies reactive to proinsulin, but not to insulin, were also found among a group of newly diagnosed T1D patients before insulin treatment, with

Each residue is represented by a square, with shaded squares denoting residues that differ between the two molecules. The beginning and ending residues for the leader peptide [L(-24)-L(-1)], the B chain (B1-B30), the C peptide (C33-C63), and the A chain (A66-A86) are indicated. To convert preproinsulin to the mature insulin molecule depicted in panel C, the leader peptide is cleaved at the black arrow, neuroendocrine prohormone convertases PC3 (PC1) and PC2 perform endoproteolytic cleavages at the two blue arrows, and carboxypeptidase E trims the four residues marked with stars.

Epitopes for CD4⁺ T cells are indicated by different colors or shading patterns, and the beginning and ending residues for each epitope are labeled. Broken red arrows denote CD8⁺ T-cell epitopes. As is true for certain other β-cell antigens, certain preproinsulin peptides are antigenic in both humans and NOD mice (including the CD4⁺ T-cell epitope B9-23), and CD8⁺ T-cell epitopes overlap those for CD4⁺ T cells.

the main reactivity directed toward the C-peptide portion of the proinsulin molecule (9).

Insulin is not retained in the unfixed tissue used for the ICA immunofluorescence assay; thus, insulin reactivity does not contribute to this signal. Rather it is glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and insulinoma-associated protein 2, two other extensively characterized β-cell antigens, which are the main proteins detected by this assay (10).

GAD

Many years after the observation was made that sera from newly diagnosed T1D patients could precipitate an islet cell protein of 64 kDa, the protein was at last identified as GAD (11). GAD is the rate-limiting enzyme in the conversion of glutamic acid to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), well known as an inhibitory neurotransmitter but also a potential signaling molecule in the pancreatic islet. GAD is expressed in the central and peripheral nervous systems, pancreatic islets, epithelial cells of the fallopian tube, and spermatozoa. Thus, unlike insulin, GAD is not a β-cell-specific protein. GAD exists in two forms, GAD65 (65 kDa; 585 amino acids) and GAD67 (67 kDa; 593 amino acids). They are encoded by two separate genes and are 65% identical overall, with the N-terminal 95 amino acids showing the greatest divergence. Only GAD65 is expressed in the β cells of human islets, where it is modified by lipids and anchored to the cytosolic face of synaptic-like microvesicles that store and secrete GABA. Up to 70% of new-onset T1D patients have antibodies to GAD65, compared to 4% of normal controls (12). The epitopes recognized are largely conformational and map primarily to the middle and C-terminal thirds of the protein (13, 14). The middle domain contains at least five distinct epitopes and the C-terminal domain at least seven (14). While antibodies to GAD67 can be found in approximately 10% of new-onset patients, their crossreaction with GAD65, coupled with the lack of expression of GAD67 in human islets, indicates that GAD65 is the eliciting antigen (12).

Insulinoma-associated protein 2 and insulinoma-associated protein 2β

Sera from diabetic patients immunoprecipitate 64-kDa proteins in addition to GAD from insulinoma lysates, and mild trypsin treatment leads to the production of fragments of 40 kDa and 37 kDa. The

Lieberman & DiLorenzo: Islet β-cell antigens in type 1 diabetes

40-kDa fragment has been shown to represent amino acids 653–979 of insulinoma-associated protein 2 (IA-2), a member of the receptor-type protein tyrosine phosphatase family (15). Similarly, the β-cell antigen designated ICA 512, independently identified from a screen of a human islet cDNA expression library using sera from diabetic patients (16), is also now known to represent a fragment of IA-2 (15). In addition to β cells, IA-2 is enriched in the secretory granules of neuroendocrine cells, including peptidergic neurons, pituitary cells, and adrenal chromaffin cells. The full-length protein is predicted to have a luminal domain (amino acids 1–576), a single transmembrane domain (577–601), and a cytoplasmic tail (602–979) containing a tyrosine phosphatase motif. In β cells, the localization of IA-2 to the membrane of insulin secretory granules suggests its possible involvement in the trafficking or maturation of the granules. However, no enzymatic activity has been demonstrated for IA-2, and several substitutions within the tyrosine phosphatase domain appear to be responsible for its inactivity against the substrates tested thus far. Post-translational processing of the approximately 100-kDa IA-2 protein involves proteolytic cleavage within the luminal domain, resulting in the approximately 64 kDa mature form that is immunoprecipitated by patient sera.

Initial studies with the full-length IA-2 protein indicated that 54–66% of diabetic patients had circulating antibodies to IA-2 (10, 17), while no reactivity was detected among age-matched normal controls (10). Further work revealed that the immune response was directed toward conformational epitopes located exclusively within the cytoplasmic portion of the protein (17). At least four distinct epitopes have been found to be contained within amino acids 605–620, 605–682, 687–979, and 777–937. As already mentioned, partial proteolysis of immune complexes formed using diabetic sera and 64-kDa insulinoma proteins yields major fragments of 40 kDa (derived from IA-2) and 37 kDa. The 37-kDa fragment is now known to be derived from another member of the tyrosine phosphatase family designated either phogrin (phosphatase homolog in granules of insulinoma) (18) or insulinoma-associated protein 2β (IA-2β) (19). The use of the latter name is supported by the finding that the intracellular domain of the IA-2β protein (amino acids 640–1015) is 74% identical to that of IA-2, coupled with its high expression in insulinoma βTC-1 cells. Like IA-2, IA-2β localizes to the insulin secretory granule membrane and is also expressed in the brain (20), and it also has substitutions in the tyrosine phosphatase domain that would be predicted to render the enzyme inactive. Sera from diabetic patients that react with IA-2 often bind IA-2β also. However, while reactivity to IA-2β can be completely blocked by preincubation with IA-2, reactivity to IA-2 is only partially blocked by preincubation with IA-2β (21). Thus, IA-2, rather than IA-2β, is believed to be the primary target for this aspect of the humoral immune response.


CPE

Due in large part to international efforts to achieve assay standardization, antibodies to insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 are the most widely used immunological markers for T1D diagnosis and prediction (22). However, as seen in Table 1, antibodies have also been detected to a number of other less well-characterized β-cell antigens, one of which is CPE. By screening a rat islet cDNA expression library with serum from a prediabetic sibling of a T1D patient who later also progressed to T1D, CPE (also known as carboxypeptidase H) was identified as a diabetes autoantigen (23). Twenty-five percent (five of 20) of ICA+ first-degree relatives of T1D patients were shown to have circulating autoantibodies to CPE, compared to none of 14 serum samples from healthy individuals. Like GAD and IA-2/IA-2β, CPE shares a neuroendocrine expression pattern (including expression in islets, adrenal medulla, pituitary, and other neuroendocrine cells). Its function is related to the production of peptide hormones and neurotransmitters. In islets, CPE is a major protein component of insulin-secretory granules, largely membrane associated, and, as mentioned above, participates in the conversion of proinsulin to insulin.


Heat shock protein (HSP)-60

Originally identified as a *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* HSP-65 cross-reactive antigen against which young non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice spontaneously produced antibodies and cellular responses (see below) (24), one study found significantly higher titers of antibodies to certain regions of HSP-60 in children with T1D (within 1 month of diagnosis) compared to healthy controls (25).


Islet cell autoantigen of 69 kDa

Islet cell autoantigen of 69 kDa (ICA69) was identified by screening a human islet cDNA expression library with pooled sera from three prediabetic relatives of a T1D patient, all of whom later became overtly diabetic (26). The resulting sequence of the positive cDNA showed little homology to any known sequence, with the exception of two short regions of similarity with bovine serum albumin. Expression studies showed that ICA69 RNA is detected in islets and brain, with some message detected in heart, thyroid, and kidney. Screening of sera from subjects at risk for T1D development showed positivity for ICA69 antibodies in 43% (10 of 23) of ICA+ first-degree relatives who later developed T1D. A subsequent study showed that 30% (18 of 59) of T1D patients, recently diagnosed, had detectable anti-ICA69 antibodies (27).

Additional antibody targets

Continued study of serum samples from recently diagnosed or longstanding T1D patients led to the identification of additional targets of the humoral immune response. These antigens vary in their tissue expression patterns as well as in their subcellular localization. Ubiquitously or widely expressed proteins to which T1D sera have shown reactivity include DNA topoisomerase II (DNA TopII) (28), HSP-70 (29), HSP-90 (30), glucose transporter 2 (GLUT2) (31), and transcription factors jun-B (32) and SOX13 (also known as ICA12), a member of the sex-determining region Y-type high-mobility group box family of transcription factors (33). Antigens expressed in a neuroendocrine pattern (generally in secretory granules and/or plasma membrane) and recognized by T1D patient sera include glycosylated islet membrane antigen of 38 kDa (glima 38) (34), and the lipid antigens sulfatide (35) and the gangliosides GM2-1 (36) and GT3 (37). Clearly, a wide array of antigens is targeted by the humoral immune system during the pathogenesis of T1D. Further study is necessary to determine which of these or other antigens are targeted during the initial phases of β-cell destruction vs those that become targets as a result of such destruction. In addition, it is important to demonstrate T-cell reactivity to these antigens to help validate their role in the T-cell-mediated destruction of β cells.

NOD mice

Like T1D patients, NOD mice develop antibodies to insulin, and the detection of such antibodies at 8 weeks of age is a remarkably accurate predictor of early disease onset (8). Antibodies to CPE, HSP-60, and the intermediate filament protein peripherin also arise spontaneously in NOD mice (38). Reports have suggested that NOD mice also develop humoral immune responses to GAD and IA-2. However, the consensus that grew out of a recent international workshop exploring this issue was that, among insulin, GAD, and IA-2, only insulin is a specific target of the humoral immune response in NOD mice (39). The workshop found that the detection of GAD and IA-2 antibodies varied widely depending on the colony tested, and the specificity of the generally low reactivity of NOD sera with these proteins could not be established.

Utility and importance

As was noted as early as the 1970s for ICA (6), antibodies to insulin, GAD65, and IA-2 can be detected among first-degree relatives of T1D patients. Importantly, measurement of antibodies to these three proteins allows prediction of T1D in at-risk individuals, with the presence of two or more antibodies being highly predictive of future

disease (22). Among first-degree relatives of T1D patients with 5 years of follow-up, the presence of two or more of these antibodies has 68% positive predictive value (calculated by dividing the number of positive subjects who develop T1D by the total number of positive subjects) and 80% sensitivity (calculated by dividing the number of positive subjects who develop T1D by the total number of subjects who develop the disease). The presence of all three antibodies has 100% positive predictive value and 52% sensitivity. While extremely useful for prediction, antibodies are not thought to directly contribute to β-cell damage, as T1D is now well established as a T-cell-mediated disease, requiring contributions from both CD4⁺ and CD8⁺ T cells (40). Nonetheless, B cells are indeed important for the development of T1D in the NOD mouse model of the disease, where they act as essential antigen-presenting cells for the activation of pathogenic β-cell-specific T cells (41). In several cases, including GAD65, insulin, and IA-2, β-cell antigens originally identified by serology have subsequently been shown to also be targeted by T cells.

CD4⁺ T-cell responses

While multiple genetic loci contribute to autoimmune diabetes susceptibility in both humans and NOD mice, the strongest association is with the occurrence of particular combinations of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II alleles (41, 42). Epidemiological studies show a strong association between T1D and expression of the class II MHC molecules human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR3 and -DR4. HLA-DQ2 and -DQ8, which occur in tight linkage with HLA-DR3 and -DR4, respectively, are primarily responsible for this association. Similarly, expression of the class II molecule I-Ag7 in the absence of I-E represents the major genetic component determining diabetes susceptibility in the NOD mouse. These findings, coupled with the observation that MHC class II-restricted CD4⁺ T cells are absolutely required for diabetes development in the NOD mouse (41), highlight the importance of identifying the antigenic targets of these pathogenic β-cell-reactive T cells.

The CD4⁺ T-cell epitopes

Table 2 lists the CD4⁺ T-cell epitopes that have been reported for human or murine β-cell antigens. For epitopes identified in NOD mice, the table indicates which T-cell responses arise spontaneously and which have thus far only been detected after immunization with the corresponding peptide or with whole protein. In the case of T-cell responses found after immunization, it cannot be assumed that responses arise naturally to these epitopes during disease development; one can only conclude that the peptides in question are indeed

Table 2

immunogenic when presented in the context of I-A<sup>g7</sup>. A further caveat in the case of responses detected to immunizing peptides is that the peptide in question may not necessarily be naturally processed from the corresponding protein, even though a response can be elicited to the peptide when it is provided exogenously. Due to technical demands, it is only in rare instances that the epitopes of β-cell antigens have been confirmed to be naturally processed and presented using mass spectrometric analysis of peptides eluted from immunoaffinity-purified MHC molecules (43–45).

While NOD mice are valuable for the identification of β-cell proteins targeted by CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells, the specific peptides recognized by the mice will not necessarily be targeted in humans. The primary reason for this concern is that peptides that bind I-A<sup>g7</sup> may be unable to bind human class II molecules. Also, peptides of the same sequence may not be present in the human version of the antigenic β-cell protein. To directly identify human β-cell peptides recognized by T cells in the context of human class II molecules, two main strategies have been used. One is the direct examination of T cells from recent-onset patients and at-risk individuals. A second strategy for the identification of human peptides recognized by β-cell-reactive CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells is the use of mice transgenically expressing the diabetes-associated class II molecules HLA-DR4 or -DQ8. In this approach, mice are immunized with a human protein of interest or with peptides derived from it. As indicated in Table 2, several epitopes identified in this way were also shown to be recognized by T cells from T1D patients or at-risk individuals, thus demonstrating the utility of the HLA-transgenic mouse approach in identifying bona fide human T-cell epitopes.

As seen in Table 2, there is considerable overlap among the antigens, and even the specific epitopes, targeted by CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells in

NOD mice and humans. For these reasons, murine and human T-cell responses to selected β-cell antigens will be treated together below.

GAD65

NOD mice have been particularly useful for the characterization of the earliest T-cell responses that arise during the prediabetic period. CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cell responses to β-cell antigens develop in a loosely defined chronological order in NOD mice, with a response to GAD65 being noted as early as 4 weeks of age (46). Overlapping peptides were used to map these early epitopes to amino acids 509–528 and 524–543, with an additional epitope (247–266) targeted in 7-week-old animals. The findings that GAD65 is one of the early CD4<sup>+</sup>T-cell targets and that tolerance induction to the protein blocks disease development (46) generated considerable interest. Subsequent studies mapped additional epitopes, including an immunodominant one at 206–220 (47, 48).

The use of human peripheral blood samples has led to the identification of a number of human GAD65 peptides recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup>T cells (44, 49–55). The identification of peptides 206–220 and 247–266 as epitopes in humans (49, 54) is intriguing, because the corresponding peptides from murine GAD65 (differing at 0 or 3 positions, respectively) were also identified as targets in NOD mice as already mentioned (46, 48). This is consistent with the finding that I-A<sup>g7</sup> and HLA-DQ8 are capable of binding similar peptides, including 206–220 of GAD65 (56). Additional human GAD65 epitopes identified by immunization of HLA-DQ8 or -DR4 transgenic mice were also shown to be recognized by T cells from T1D patients or at-risk individuals (52–54, 57, 58).

Lieberman & DiLorenzo: Islet β-cell antigens in type 1 diabetes

Preproinsulin, proinsulin, and insulin

Unlike humans, NOD mice express two different forms of insulin (insulin 1 and 2) derived from two different genes. The first example of CD4⁺ T-cell reactivity to insulin was a panel of six independent CD4⁺ T-cell clones isolated from the islets of prediabetic NOD mice, all of which were shown to recognize B9-23 of insulin 2, suggesting that this region of the B chain constitutes an immunodominant CD4⁺ T-cell epitope in NOD mice (59). The analogous peptide in insulin 1 differs only at the N-terminal amino acid, and the clones also recognized the insulin 1 peptide. All six of the B9-23-specific clones were capable of accelerating diabetes development when transferred to young NOD mice. These findings led to a directed study exploring whether this same peptide (which is identical in mouse and human insulin) might also be targeted by CD4⁺ T cells in patients (60). Strikingly, 83% of recent-onset diabetes patients showed a proliferative response to B9-23, as did 3 of 5 at-risk individuals who had never received insulin therapy. Age- or HLA-matched controls did not respond. B9-23 is currently the only epitope in mature insulin known to be recognized by human CD4⁺ T cells. A hybridoma generated from islet-infiltrating T cells of an NOD mouse recognizes an additional epitope (B2-17) from mature insulin (61). However, all of the other insulin-related CD4⁺ T-cell epitopes that have been identified in NOD mice, humans, or HLA-transgenic mice are derived not from mature insulin but from proinsulin and/or preproinsulin (50, 61-63). Thus, a number of epitopes that span the B/C and the C/A junction have been identified, as have epitopes in the C peptide alone and even ones that include amino acids from the leader sequence (Fig. 1). Of note, splenic and pancreatic lymph node T cells from very young (i.e., 4-week-old) NOD mice respond to B24-C33 of murine proinsulin (62). In a study of 10 at-risk human subjects, greater than half responded to an overlapping region (B24-C36) of human proinsulin (50). Elevated circulating proinsulin levels have been reported in subjects at risk for the development of T1D. This aberrant release of a normally sequestered molecule might facilitate the generation of an immune response against it.

IA-2

The finding of antibodies to IA-2 in greater than 50% of T1D patients and in at-risk individuals soon led to a search for CD4⁺ T-cell proliferative responses to this antigen. When patients and controls (all having diabetes-associated MHC haplotypes) were compared, 59% of new-onset patients and 80% of first-degree relatives having antibodies to at least one islet cell antigen showed a T-cell response to IA-2, whereas only 8% of normal control subjects responded (64). Epitopes in the intracellular domain of IA-2 were

subsequently identified (43, 65, 66). In an exemplary study, the IA-2 peptides naturally processed and presented by HLA-DR4 were identified by mass spectrometry from cells provided with exogenous antigen (43). Peptides representing five of the six naturally processed and presented regions were shown to elicit T-cell responses in recent-onset HLA-DR4⁺ T1D patients, but not in HLA-DR4⁺ normal controls. Importantly, five of the epitopes found to be targeted by at-risk individuals in an earlier report, including the dominant one (805–820), overlap the peptides now known to be naturally presented (65). Spontaneous T-cell responses to IA-2 in NOD mice have also been reported (67).

HSP-60

T-cell reactivity specific for HSP-60 was first detected as a spontaneous proliferative response of splenocytes from young (2-month-old) NOD mice toward mycobacterial HSP-65 (24). HSP-65-specific diabetogenic CD4⁺ T-cell clones were subsequently shown to respond more vigorously to human HSP-60 (formerly designated HSP-65), and an immunodominant epitope was mapped to amino acids 437–460 (designated p277) (68). The T-cell response to HSP-60 was unique to NOD mice, as splenocytes from C57BL/6 and SJL did not respond (69). Treatment of NOD mice with either human or murine p277 (which differ by one amino acid) decreased the incidence of diabetes development (68, 69). The proliferative response of T cells from T1D patients of recent onset (<14 weeks) also showed a heightened response to HSP-60 compared to healthy controls (70), with activity mapping primarily to p277 and 466–485. These results collectively led to a preliminary clinical trial in which new-onset T1D patients were treated with p277 (DiaPep 277) or placebo (71). While the trial was small, the DiaPep 277-treated patients seemed to preserve some endogenous insulin production, as mean C-peptide concentrations were maintained, and the need for exogenous insulin was lower in this group as compared to the placebo group. HSP-60 is a ubiquitously expressed protein, raising questions as to how it is involved in the highly β-cell-specific destruction of T1D.

ICA69

ICA69 protein was used to screen for a T-cell response in T1D patients of recent-onset, of long-standing duration, first-degree relatives, or rheumatoid arthritis patients (27). A high-proliferative T-cell response was only detectable in newly diagnosed T1D patients (within 1 week of insulin treatment initiation); however, the response was not demonstrated in all patients within this group. Interestingly, the authors noted an inverse correlation between the ICA69-specific
T-cell proliferative response, and the presence of serum antibodies recognizing ICA 69. Further, a T-cell response to ICA 69 was associated with expression of HLA-DR3.

Upon immunization of NOD mice with ICA 69 protein or an ICA 69 peptide (amino acids 36–47, designated Tep 69), ICA 69-and Tep 69-specific T cells were detected in draining lymph nodes (72, 73); however, only a weak and inconsistent response to ICA 69 was noted when splenocytes from unimmunized diabetic female NOD mice were cultured *in vitro* with Tep 69 (72). More recently, ICA69<sup>null</sup> NOD mice were generated and shown to develop diabetes with similar incidence as wild-type NOD mice, suggesting that the response to ICA 69 is not absolutely required for disease development (74).

S100β

Multiple β-cell antigens are expressed in a neuroendocrine fashion, and a connection exists between islet and nervous system autoimmunity. This link was recently explored in NOD mice (75). It was found that T-cell accumulation in islets initially occurs in the vicinity of the non-myelinating Schwann cells that surround the islets. As the insulitic lesion progresses, the Schwann cells are gradually eliminated, apparently due to a specific autoimmune attack, rather than a simple consequence of the local inflammation. NOD females exhibit a spontaneous T-cell proliferative response to Schwann cell proteins, including GAD 65, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein S100β, as early as 3–4 weeks of age. This response is detected in both splenocytes and pancreatic, but not other, lymph nodes and is not detected in splenocytes from other strains of mice (C57BL/6, BALB/c, SJL/J). Using reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, it was found that, like GAD 65, S100β (but not GFAP) is expressed at low levels in β cells. This study also showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from newly diagnosed diabetic children and from ICA<sup>+</sup> first-degree relatives (but not from ICA<sup>−</sup> first-degree relatives) respond to S100β, thus extending the relevance of this antigen to the human disease.

### Additional CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell targets

CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses have been documented for several other β-cell antigens, generally following their identification from serological studies. In NOD mice, spontaneous T-cell responses to CPE (38), peripherin (38), and IA-2β (76) were demonstrated in splenocytes of 4-to 6-week-old animals. Two CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell epitopes unique to GAD 67 (which is expressed in mouse islets in addition to GAD 65) have also been identified (47). In humans, T-cell responses toward jun-B were detected in 71% (12 of 17) of T1D patients within 6 weeks of diagnosis and in 50% (8 of 16) of ICA<sup>+</sup> first-degree relatives (32).

For a more limited number of β-cell antigens, the detection of T-cell responses, rather than serology, provided the first evidence of their potential importance. A T-cell proliferative response toward HSP-70 was demonstrated in 85% (20 of 25) of T1D patients within 12 weeks of diagnosis compared to only 14% (four of 28) of healthy controls (29). Islet mitochondrial antigen of 38 kDa (Imogen 38) was identified by screening a subtracted cDNA fragment expression library with a CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell clone from the peripheral blood of a newly diagnosed T1D patient (77). Finally, hepatocarcinoma-intestine-pancreas/pancreatic associated protein (HIP/PAP) is a unique antigen in that its potential importance was originally discovered in a search for genes overexpressed in islets in T1D using islets obtained from a patient who died at the onset of disease (78). The authors then showed a spontaneous proliferative T-cell response to HIP/PAP in NOD, but not C57BL/6, splenocytes. HIP/PAP is a Reg family protein believed to be involved in islet regeneration.

#### CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses

Studies in NOD mice have shown that β-cell cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are absolutely required for diabetes development (41). Such effectors are also suspected contributors to β-cell elimination in both new-onset and graft-recurrent T1D patients. β cells, which express class I (but not class II) MHC molecules, can be directly recognized and killed by cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells specific for β-cell peptides. Thus, identification of the antigens and epitopes targeted by these T cells could lead to the development of novel intervention and therapeutic strategies and is crucial for a thorough understanding of the pathogenic process. Recent interest in this area has been generated by the increasingly strong indications that certain MHC class I alleles may be risk factors for T1D development (41, 42). While the list of β-cell peptides known to be recognized by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Table 2) is noticeably longer than that for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (Table 3), several different approaches have recently led to significant progress in this critical area. Important advances include the definition of insulin and proinsulin epitopes recognized by CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (79, 80) and identification of a novel β-cell antigen not previously identified by serology (45). Given the relative lack of information regarding β-cell targets and epitopes for CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, all reports (even isolated ones) will be highlighted below.

#### Proinsulin and insulin

It is particularly imperative to identify peptide epitopes for T cells of known pathogenicity. This is exactly what was done in the case of

Table 3

G9C8, an H-2Kᵈ-restricted CD8⁺T-cell clone originally isolated from the islets of a 7-week-old NOD mouse and known to be capable of transferring disease (79). By screening a β-cell cDNA expression library, the insulin cDNA was identified as encoding the G9C8 antigen. Overlapping insulin peptides were then tested, and the epitope was mapped to B15-23. This peptide is conserved in insulin 1 and insulin 2, and it is entirely contained within B9-23, previously identified as an immunodominant epitope for CD4⁺T cells. Using B15-23/H-2Kᵈ tetramers, insulin-reactive T cells can be identified in the islets of 4-week-old NOD mice, where they constitute up to 10% of the infiltrating CD8⁺T cells (81). Though this percentage declines with age, the presence of these T cells in the early islet infiltrate suggests that insulin is one of the early targets for the β-cell cytotoxic CD8⁺T-cell response. There is an isolated report that B15-23 can also bind HLA-A24 and that peptide-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes can be generated from HLA-A24⁺T1D patients (82).

A novel proinsulin-derived CD8⁺T-cell epitope was recently identified quite serendipitously (80). In this study, the proinsulin CD4⁺T-cell epitope B24-C36 was administered intranasally to NOD mice in an attempt to generate regulatory T cells and prevent diabetes. Regulatory T cells capable of transferring disease protection to other NOD mice were indeed generated. However, the peptide-treated mice were not themselves protected. The B24-C36 peptide contained within it a peptide predicted to bind H-2Kᵈ (B25-C34). Further work demonstrated that this peptide was generating cytotoxic CD8⁺T-cell responses in mice treated with B24-C36, and their presence overwhelmed the regulatory T cells that were also generated, resulting in a net effect of no disease protection. B25-C34 thus represents a novel proinsulin-derived CD8⁺T-cell epitope of potential pathogenic relevance.

Islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein

Islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein (IGRP) was identified as the β-cell antigen targeted by a highly prevalent and pathogenic population of CD8⁺T cells in NOD mice by using the representative 8.3 T-cell clone to screen peptides eluted from class I MHC molecules purified from a β-cell tumor line (45). As such, the antigenic IGRP peptide, amino acids 206-214, is known to be naturally processed and presented by β cells. In addition to this antigenic IGRP peptide, we know that at least one other IGRP peptide is naturally processed and presented by β cells (S.M. Lieberman, A.M. Evans, J. Shabanowitz, D.F. Hunt, and T.P. DiLorenzo, unpublished observation). Studies to determine whether other IGRP peptides are immunogenic are currently being pursued. IGRP is expressed in a β-cell-specific manner and is an ER membrane-resident protein predicted to span the membrane 9 times (83). While homologous to the catalytic subunit of G6Pase, no catalytic activity has been demonstrated for IGRP, and its function is currently unknown. Notably, CD8⁺T-cell clones isolated from NOD islets at the earliest stages of detectable islet infiltration were shown to recognize IGRP 206-214, suggesting that IGRP may be one of the first targets of the pathogenic β-cell attack (45). The full cell-mediated immune response toward IGRP in NOD mice, as well as the presence of reactive CD8⁺or CD4⁺T cells or antibodies in peripheral blood of T1D patients, is currently being evaluated. The human IGRP gene resides in the area of chromosome 2 previously identified as diabetes susceptibility locus IDDM7. Lack of IGRP expression in the rat suggests that it may be nonessential; thus, IGRP may be a prime

target for inactivation in an attempt to curb the β-cell immune attack
in NOD mice and humans.

### Islet amyloid polypeptide

Amylin, or islet amyloid polypeptide (IAPP), is a 37-amino acid
peptide located in β-cell secretory granules. In a preliminary report
(84), computer algorithms were used to identify HLA-A2-binding
peptides from preproIAPP, and T1D patients were screened for
responding T cells by ELISpot assay. Positive results were obtained
for an HLA-A2-binding peptide derived from the leader sequence of
preproIAPP (amino acids 5–13). Specifically, peripheral blood mono-
nuclear cells from six of nine T1D patients of recent-onset (<180
days), but not from nine T1D patients with long-standing diabetes
(>180 days) or nine non-diabetic controls, showed positive responses
to this peptide.

### GAD65

A single report demonstrated that a GAD65 peptide capable of
binding HLA-A2 could lead to the generation of peptide-specific
cytotoxic T lymphocytes from two recent-onset T1D patients and
an ICA⁺ first-degree relative of a T1D patient, though not from
normal controls (85). In addition, spleen cells from NOD mice respond
to target cells pulsed with two independent epitopes from murine
GAD65 (86). While both reports suggest that these peptides are
worthy of further exploration, confirmatory studies are currently
lacking.

### IA-2

An IA-2 peptide capable of binding HLA-A2 was used to generate
cytotoxic T cells from islet antibody-positive relatives of T1D
patients in an isolated report (87). However, peptide-specific T cells
were also successfully generated from normal controls. Such a
response thus would not be useful as a screen to identify prediabetic
individuals. Nonetheless, CD8⁺ T cells recognizing this IA-2 epitope
could still participate in β-cell destruction, as misregulation of these
T cells *in vivo* may occur in T1D patients but not healthy controls.

### What makes a protein an autoantigen?

One of the motivations that drives antigen identification studies is
the hypothesis that autoantigens have unique characteristics that
account for why they are targeted in the diabetogenic autoimmune
attack while other proteins are not. Elucidation of these character-

istics should lead to a better understanding of the immunopathogen-
esis underlying the disease.

### Location

It is tempting to speculate that subcellular localization is a key factor in
determining immunogenicity of β-cell constituents. As depicted in Fig. 2,
there is a clear preponderance of antigens located within the components
of the secretory pathway, most notably the secretory granules, but also
the synaptic-like microvesicles and the ER and Golgi network. Among the
antigens associated with the secretory pathway are insulin, GAD65, and
IGRP, all of which are known to be targeted by some of the earliest
pathogenic T-cell responses in NOD mice (45, 46, 59, 79, 81). This is not
an absolute prerequisite though, as several β-cell antigens localize to the
nucleus, cytosol, or mitochondria. However, it should be kept in mind that
some of the antigens depicted in Fig. 2 are probably not targeted early in
the disease process, and so responses to them may only occur as a result of
the aberrant release of cellular constituents due to extensive T-cell-
mediated β-cell destruction. Continued identification and characterization
of the antigens involved in the early stages of β-cell autoimmunity are
required in order to gain a better understanding of the role of subcellular
location in determining autoimmunogenicity.

### Thymic expression

In humans, the non-MHC locus that confers the strongest suscept-
ibility to T1D is the insulin gene (*Ins*) variable number of tandem
repeats (VNTR) regulatory region (42). The alleles designated class I
contain approximately 30–60 repeats of the 14-base pair sequence
ACAGGGGGTCTGGGG, while class III alleles have greater than 100
repeats. (Intermediate, or class II, alleles are rarely seen.) Class I
VNTR alleles predispose to diabetes, while class III alleles are dom-
inantly protective. The disease-associated class I alleles are correl-
ated with reduced thymic expression of the *Ins* gene, which in turn
has been proposed to lead to defective central tolerance induction to
insulin and proinsulin (Fig. 3A). Studies in the NOD mouse are con-
sistent with this view (88). In NOD mice, both *Ins1* and *Ins2* are
expressed in the β cell, yet only *Ins2* is expressed in the thymus.
*Ins2⁻/⁻* NOD mice show accelerated diabetes and insulitis, suggesting
that, as in the human case, reduced thymic expression and impaired
induction of central tolerance do indeed account, at least in part, for
why proinsulin and insulin become targets for the immune system.
Alternatively spliced variants for a number of β-cell autoantigens,
including IA-2, IGRP, and ICA69, have been reported. In the case of IA-2,
both a full-length transcript and an exon 13-deleted form are present in
islets, while only the transcript lacking exon 13 is found in the thymus
and spleen, i.e., organs in which central and peripheral tolerance

Fig. 2. Subcellular localization of β-cell antigens. The proteins and lipids to which T1D patients and/or NOD mice have demonstrated immune responses are each denoted by a different symbol in this schematic representation of a β cell. The position of each symbol within the β cell indicates the cellular compartment in which that particular antigen is primarily localized. Although antigens are located throughout the β cell, the highest number of antigens (nine of 24) is associated with the secretory granules.

induction, respectively, can occur (Fig. 3B) (89). Intriguingly, several IA-2 antibody and T-cell epitopes map to exon 13 of the protein. Thus, differential expression of alternatively spliced variants in lymphoid organs and β cells may constitute another mechanism that allows a particular protein to become an autoantigen.

### Available peptides

In mice and humans, associations with T1D have been noted for both class I and class II MHC molecules (41, 42). The associations are particularly strong in the case of class II, with I-A<sup>g7</sup> in NOD mice and DQ8 and DQ2 in humans conferring susceptibility to disease. In class II molecules that do not confer susceptibility, an aspartic acid is found at position 57 of the β chain, while I-A<sup>g7</sup> has a serine at that position, and DQ8 and DQ2 have an alanine. These polymorphisms alter the shape of the P9 pocket of the peptide-binding groove and the spectrum of peptides that can bind (56). Structural studies demonstrate that the

peptide-binding groove of DQ8 and I-A<sup>g7</sup> are remarkably similar, and these molecules can indeed bind some of the same peptides, including insulin B9–23 and GAD65 206–220. This is consistent with the finding that several autoantigenic epitopes for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in NOD mice have also been shown to be targeted by DQ8-restricted T cells from patients. In order for a protein to be antigenic for T cells in a given mouse or human, peptides naturally processed from the protein must be capable of binding an MHC molecule expressed in that individual (Fig. 3C). Thus, whether or not this occurs is another determining factor governing whether a particular self-protein can become an autoantigen.

### Folding issues

Finally, the newly identified antigen IGRP may also shed some light on the issue of what makes a protein an autoantigen. The full-length IGRP protein is predicted to be an ER resident that spans the

Lieberman & DiLorenzo: Islet β-cell antigens in type 1 diabetes

Fig. 3. Factors governing whether a protein can become an autoantigen.

(A) Inadequate thymic expression. A number of β-cell-specific genes are expressed by thymic epithelial cells (TEC), and the resultant display of β-cell peptides on MHC molecules leads to deletion of potentially β-cell autoreactive T cells. In humans, protective class III VNTR alleles of the insulin gene correlate with increased thymic expression, resulting in the negative selection of pathogenic insulin-reactive T cells (top). In contrast, T1D-associated class I VNTR alleles correlate with diminished thymic expression and the failure of pathogenic T cells to be deleted (bottom).

(B) Expression of a full-length protein in the β cell, but not in the thymus. For the antigen IA-2 in humans, cells in the thymus express only an alternatively spliced transcript in which exon 13 is deleted (top). However, in β cells, a full-length transcript is also expressed (bottom). The finding that several B- and T-cell epitopes for IA-2 map to exon 13 suggests that the failure of peptides from exon 13 to be presented in the thymus leads to escape of a subset of IA-2-reactive T cells from thymic deletion.

(C) Availability of MHC-binding peptides. A particular protein can only become a target for autoreactive T cells if peptides from it are presented on the particular MHC molecules expressed in the individual. If peptides processed from a given protein (green) do not fit the MHC peptide-binding groove, antigen-presenting cells (APC) will not be able to activate T cells specific for that protein. The diabetes-associated MHC molecules DQ8 and I-Ag7 bind similar peptides, including some identical peptides from β-cell antigens (blue).

membrane nine times. The apparently complex interaction required between the protein and the ER membrane could conceivably lead to errors in folding and/or to mislocalization of IGRP. Proteins that fail to either fold or localize to their correct cellular compartment in a timely fashion have been termed defective ribosomal products (DRiPs) by Yewdell and colleagues (90). Evidence suggests that DRiPs are preferentially targeted by the proteasome for degradation to peptides that serve as ligands for class I MHC molecules (Fig. 3D). Further, both the murine and human IGRP messages exist as alternatively spliced forms, some of which would not permit synthesis of the full-length protein. Proteins translated from the alternatively spliced forms would be predicted to mislocalize and/or misfold, and thus be preferentially degraded by the proteasome. While specula-

Table 1 lists, as comprehensively as possible, the array of β-cell antigens to which immune responses have been documented in T1D. However, it is important to realize that they do not all represent 'initiating antigens', i.e., those antigens targeted by the pathogenic immune response when β-cell destruction first begins. Indeed, the majority of them probably do not. In the case of responses noted only in diabetic humans, these reactivities likely represent responses to

previously sequestered antigens released as a consequence of the massive β-cell destruction that occurs during the prodromal period which generally spans years. Further, the majority of the listed antigens have thus far only been shown to be targeted by antibodies, rather than by T cells, and antibodies are not believed to directly mediate β-cell elimination. For a number of the antigens listed in Table 1, T-cell reactivity has not yet been assessed and should be.

Although β-cell damage is a T-cell-mediated process, antibody responses have been extraordinarily useful in allowing accurate prediction of at-risk individuals likely to develop T1D (22). Continued characterization of antibody responses in at-risk individuals may lead to an even better prediction scheme, perhaps one that will allow prediction among the general population, rather than just among genetically at-risk individuals. Identification of novel antibody targets might also lead to the identification of novel T-cell targets, because several proteins targeted by the humoral response have also been shown to elicit T-cell responses.

Nonetheless, given that β-cell destruction is T-cell mediated, it is imperative to continue to identify and characterize the initiating T-cell targets. With this as the goal, it would be most appropriate to perform antigen identification studies using T cells. Recently, a T-cell-based assay was used to identify a novel β-cell-specific protein that is a prominent and early target of the pathogenic immune response in NOD mice (45). This result demonstrates both the feasibility and the utility of a T-cell-based approach to antigen identification. T cells should be examined as early as possible during the β-cell-specific immune response. This is reasonable in NOD mice, where the disease process is fairly well-characterized and islet infiltrates and peripheral lymphoid organs are readily accessible. The finding that several β-cell proteins (and even some of the specific epitopes) tar-

geted in NOD mice are also targeted in humans is strong rationale for continuing antigen discovery studies in both standard NOD mice and those transgenic for diabetes-associated human class I and class II MHC molecules. Another advantage of the murine systems is that the pathogenic relevance of identified antigens can be assessed more readily than is possible in patients, and antigen-specific therapies can also be examined. Human studies must continue as well, however, as some of the critical antigens in the human disease may not be important in NOD mice and vice versa. In interpreting human studies, it must be remembered that T-cell responses noted in diabetic individuals may not necessarily represent responses contributing to pathogenicity. When reactivities are also found in at-risk individuals, this could constitute some support for their participation in the pathogenic process. Regardless, T-cell-based assays to assess risk for diabetes development will likely be useful adjuncts to the antibody measurements currently used for this purpose.

In the NOD mouse, insulin, IGRP, and GAD could arguably be considered initiating antigens, as they are targeted by some of the earliest β-cell reactive T-cell responses (45, 46, 59, 79, 91). However, there is evidence to suggest that additional critical antigens have not yet been identified. For example, the highly pathogenic CD8⁺ T-cell clone AI4, originally isolated from the islets of a 5-week-old NOD mouse, represents a novel specificity still to be characterized (92). Further, a number of human diabetes-relevant CD4⁺ T-cell clones isolated over the years do not appear to recognize any of the antigens catalogued thus far (40). A complete characterization of the antigens targeted by the β-cell-specific autoimmune response will not only provide additional therapeutic targets and predictive markers, but, undoubtedly, it will also provide further insight into how a normally tolerated self-protein becomes a target of the disease-initiating autoimmune response.
