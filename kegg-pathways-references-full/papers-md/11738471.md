## Abstract

Tissue transglutaminase (tTG) likely plays a role in numerous processes in the nervous system. tTG posttranslationally modifies proteins by transamidation of specific polypeptide-bound glutamines (Glns). This reaction results in the incorporation of polyamines into substrate proteins or the formation of protein crosslinks, modifications that likely have significant effects on neural function. Huntington's disease is a genetic disorder caused by an expansion of the polyglutamine domain in the huntingtin protein. Because a polypeptide-bound Gln is the determining factor for a tTG substrate, and mutant huntingtin aggregates have been found in Huntington's disease brain, it has been hypothesized that tTG may contribute to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease. In vitro, polyglutamine constructs and huntingtin are substrates of tTG. Further, the levels of tTG and TG activity are elevated in Huntington's disease brain and immunohistochemical studies have demonstrated that there is an increase in tTG reactivity in affected neurons in Huntington's disease. These findings suggest that tTG may play a role in Huntington's disease. However, in situ, neither wild type nor mutant huntingtin is modified by tTG. Further, immunocytochemical analysis revealed that tTG is totally excluded from the huntingtin aggregates, and modulation of the expression level of tTG had no effect on the frequency of the aggregates in the cells. Therefore, tTG is not required for the formation of huntingtin aggregates, and likely does not play a role in this process in Huntington's disease brain. However, tTG interacts with truncated huntingtin, and selectively polyaminates proteins that are associated with mutant truncated huntingtin. Given the fact that the levels of polyamines in cells is in the millimolar range and the crosslinking and polyaminating reactions catalyzed by tTG are competing reactions, intracellularly polyamination is likely to be the predominant reaction. Polyamination of proteins is likely to affect their function, and therefore it can be hypothesized that tTG may play a role in the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease by modifying specific proteins and altering their function and/or localization. Further research is required to define the specific role of tTG in Huntington's disease. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

## 1. Introduction

Transglutaminases (TGs) catalyze a calcium-dependent acyl transfer reaction between the γ-carboxamide group of a polypeptide-bound glutamine (Gln) and a polyamine to form a (γ-glutamyl)polyamine bond ('polyamination'). TGs also catalyze a reaction between a polypeptide-bound Gln and the ε-amino group of a polypeptide-bound lysine residue to form an ε-(γ-glutamyl)lysine isopeptide bond ('crosslinking') (Greenberg et al., 1991; Lorand and Conrad, 1984). In mammals, six enzymatically active TGs have been identified, including tissue TG (Type II, tTG) (For a review see Lesort et al., 2000a). In addition, the erythrocyte plasma membrane protein Band 4.2 is a non-catalytic TG homologue (Korsgren and Cohen, 1991; Rybicki et al., 1995).

tTG is found in the brain (Miller and Anderton, 1986; Johnson et al., 1997), as well as in numerous other mammalian tissues. tTG is primarily a cytosolic protein, however, it is also found associated with membranes (Slife et al., 1985; Korner et al., 1989; Nakaoka et al., 1994), in the extracellular space (Aeschlimann et al., 1995, 1996) and in the nucleus (Singh et al., 1995; Lesort et al., 1998). tTG has been implicated in numerous cell processes including apoptosis and neural differentiation (Birckbichler and Patterson, 1978; Selkoe et al., 1982; Maccioni and Seeds, 1986; Byrd and Lichti,

1987). tTG is also a unique member of the TG family because in addition to being a transamidating enzyme, tTG likely functions as a signal transducing G protein (Nakaoka et al., 1994). However, the signaling transducing function of tTG is beyond the scope of this review, and therefore will not be discussed (for a review see Im et al., 1997). In this review, the biochemistry and regulation of tTG will be briefly summarized, and the relevant literature pertaining to tTG and Huntington's disease (as well as other polyglutamine diseases) will be presented and discussed.

2. General overview

2.1. tTG structure and function

Full length human tTG is 687 amino acids in length with a predicted molecular mass of ~77 kDa (Gentile et al., 1991). tTG is well-conserved, with human tTG being 80–90% homologous to bovine, mouse and guinea pig tTG (Ikura et al., 1988; Gentile et al., 1991; Nakanishi et al., 1991), and ~65% homologous to chicken (Weraarchakul-Boonmark et al., 1992). The cysteine, histidine and aspartic acid residues (C277, H335 and D358 in human tTG; Gentile et al., 1991) of the TG catalytic triad are conserved in all enzymatically active TGs (Phillips et al., 1990; Kim et al., 1991; Ho et al., 1992; Grant et al., 1994; Kim et al., 1994; Dubbink et al., 1996; Aeschlimann et al., 1998). The active site cysteine (C277 in human tTG; Lee et al., 1993) is essential for the formation of the thioester bond with a substrate-bound Gln (Greenberg et al., 1991; Aeschlimann and Paulsson, 1994). In addition to the catalytic triad, the flanking domains also play a role in modulation of the transamidating activity of tTG (Iismaa et al., 1997). For example, the β-sandwich domain amino terminal to the catalytic core of tTG is required for TG activity (Iismaa et al., 1997), as it is for keratinocyte TG (Kim et al., 1994) and Factor XIII A-subunit (Lai et al., 1994).

2.2. tTG regulation and function

Calcium is required for tTG to be catalytically active as a TG (Hand et al., 1985; Greenberg et al., 1991). However, the concentrations of calcium required to activate tTG in vitro are supraphysiological (Hand et al., 1985; Smethurst and Griffin, 1996; Lai et al., 1997). It has also been demonstrated that in permeabilized cells, 10–100 μM is required for measurable tTG activity (Smethurst and Griffin, 1996). These findings have led to the hypothesis that in the cell tTG is a latent enzyme, and only in terminal conditions such as apoptosis or necrosis is there activation (Smethurst and Griffin, 1996). However, treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with the muscarinic receptor agonist carbachol results in a transient (2–5 min) increase in intracellular calcium concentrations from ~100 to ~450 nM (Pacheco and Jope, 1999) and significant activation of tTG (Zhang et al., 1998b). In cells stably overexpressing tTG, there is a significant increase in basal activity at physiological (50–100 nM) concentrations of calcium (Lesort et al., 2000b; Tucholski et al., 2001). Therefore, tTG can be activated in response to physiological increases in calcium, suggesting that intracellular factors likely modify the sensitivity of tTG to calcium.

tTG also binds and hydrolyzes GTP and ATP (Achyuthan and Greenberg, 1987; Takeuchi et al., 1992). The binding of GTP to tTG results in an inhibition of TG activity, as well as decreased calcium binding (Achyuthan and Greenberg, 1987; Takeuchi et al., 1992). Mg-GDP also effectively inhibited the transamidating activity of tTG (Lai et al., 1998). In contrast, Mg-ATP did not directly inhibit the transamidating activity of tTG, although it did inhibit the GTPase activity (Lai et al., 1998). The binding of GTP, but not ATP, to tTG also protects against proteolysis by trypsin and calpain in vitro (Achyuthan and Greenberg, 1987; Lai et al., 1998; Zhang et al., 1998a,b). GTP also protected tTG from calpain-mediated proteolysis in situ (Zhang et al., 1998a,b), indicating that the binding of GTP may play a role in modulating the turnover of tTG in cells.

tTG is expressed in neurons both in situ (Perry et al., 1995) and in vivo (Lesort et al., 1999), and TG activity has been measured in numerous different neural tissues including brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerve and superior cervical ganglia (Hand et al., 1993; Lesort et al., 2000a). The role of tTG in neuronal function is likely to be quite complex. Previously, it was suggested that tTG was involved only in terminal processes such as apoptosis (Smethurst and Griffin, 1996), however there is a growing body of evidence that tTG is an important player in physiological processes. For example, during the regeneration of rat sciatic nerve and gold fish optic nerve after injury TG activity increased (Chakraborty et al., 1987), and TG activity increases during rat spinal cord development (Perry and Haynes, 1993). Further, stable overexpression of tTG is sufficient to induce neurite outgrowth in human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells (Tucholski et al., 2001). This effect is dependent upon the transamidating activity of tTG, as a tTG with a C277S mutation, and therefore no transamidating activity, did not induce any neurite outgrowth in the cells (Tucholski et al., 2001). These findings clearly indicate a fundamental role for tTG in neuronal development and regeneration.

Although many studies have focused on the formation of protein-protein crosslinks by tTG, intracellularly tTG is more likely to catalyze the incorporation of polyamines into specific protein substrates. As indicated
above, tTG catalyzes two competing reactions, the formation of intra- and intermolecular isopeptide bonds and the polyamination of protein substrates. In vitro 1 mM putrescine almost completely inhibits the crosslinking of tau (Miller and Johnson, 1995). Given the fact that the concentration of polyamines in the brain is in the millimolar range (Morrison et al., 1995), the tTG-catalyzed polyamination of proteins is likely to be the favored reaction in the cell. Nonetheless, depending on the conditions, polyamination of proteins in vitro may not completely preclude crosslinking (Gentile et al., 1998). Numerous proteins are covalently modified by polyamination in vivo (Beninati et al., 1988; Piacentini et al., 1988), and in vitro tTG incorporates polyamines into numerous protein substrates (Cordella-Miele et al., 1993; Nemes et al., 1997; Piredda et al., 1999; Tucholski et al., 1999). Polyamination of specific protein substrates likely modulates both growth and differentiation processes. In vitro studies have allowed the identification of putative tTG substrates and also have provided some evidence with respect to the possible functional roles of polyamination by tTG. For example, polyamination of phospholipase A2 by tTG increased the activity of this enzyme (Cordella-Miele et al., 1993). The microtubule-associated protein tau is also readily polyaminated by tTG, and polyamination of tau by tTG inhibits calpain-mediated proteolysis (Tucholski et al., 1999). These and other studies clearly indicate that in situ polyamination of protein substrates regulates their metabolism and function.

Group, 1993). The Huntington’s disease gene encodes for a 350 kD protein of unknown function called huntingtin (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research Group, 1993). Mutation of the gene results in a pathological expansion of CAG repeats within an exonic sequence and its translation leads to an abnormally expanded stretch of Gln residues near the N-terminal (beginning at residue 18) of the huntingtin protein. In the non-affected population this CAG/Gln domain ranges from 6 to 39 repeats, whereas subjects with more than 39 CAG/Gln repeats will develop the disease (Gusella et al., 1993). In general, the number of the CAG/Gln repeats is inversely correlated with the age of onset of the disease, and consistent with the dominant transmission of the disease, homozygote subjects are not clinically different as compared to heterozygote subjects (Wexler et al., 1987). Despite the ubiquitous expression of the mutant huntingtin (mHtt) protein, only selective brain regions and selective population of neurons are susceptible to degeneration (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998). In addition to Huntington’s disease, seven polyglutamine-induced neurodegenerative disorders are known, including spinocerebellar ataxia type I (SCA1), dentatorubral-pallidoluysian (DRPLA), Machado-Joseph disease (SCA3), SCA2, SCA6, SCA7, and spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy. Remarkably, the mutated proteins in these disorders are unrelated with the only common feature being an abnormally expanded polyglutamine stretch in the affected protein. Further, in a mouse model, ectopic expression of a polyglutamine expansion in hypoxanthine phosphoribosyl transferase resulted in a neurological phenotype and early death (Ordway et al., 1997). These findings suggest that a common polyglutamine-dependent mechanism may be involved in these diseases.

### 3. Does tissue transglutaminase play a role in Huntington’s disease?

#### 3.1. Huntington’s disease: a polyglutamine disease

Huntington’s disease is an autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder, which inevitably leads to the death of affected individuals. The clinical features of Huntington’s disease involve progressive motor disorders and psychiatric disturbances with gradual dementia. Chorea is the most common motor dysfunction associated with Huntington’s disease, and consists first of small, jerky, continuous and irregular involuntary movements that eventually become so severe that they are incompatible with normal daily activity. The clinical progression of Huntington’s disease is paralleled by a specific pattern of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration, predominantly in the striatum and at later stage of the disease in the cerebral cortex (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998). A fundamental step in understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms associated with Huntington’s disease occurred with the identification of the gene that contains the disease-causing mutation (The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research

#### 3.2. Presence of insoluble aggregates: a neuropathological characteristic of polyglutamine diseases

A pathological hallmark of Huntington’s disease brain is the presence of insoluble nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates composed of the mHtt protein (DiFiglia et al., 1997). In addition, intranuclear and cytosolic huntingtin aggregates have been described in transgenic mice (Davies et al., 1997) as well as in several cellular models (Saudou et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999) for Huntington’s disease (Fig. 1). Immunocytochemical analyses have revealed that aggregates stain positively for ubiquitin both in brain tissue (DiFiglia et al., 1997; Becher et al., 1998; Gutekunst et al., 1999) and cell culture models (Saudou et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999) (Fig. 2A), but are not readily degraded via the ubiquitin-proteasome dependent pathways. Several chaperone proteins, such as heat shock protein 40 (Hsp40)and Hsp70, redistribute to the nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates (Wytttenbach et al., 2000) (Fig. 2B). Further, other polyglutamine-containing proteins, such as transcription factors and transcription factor regulators (Perez et al., 1998; Boutell et al., 1999; McCampbell et al., 2000; Shimohata et al., 2000; Steffan et al., 2000) can be sequestered in the intranuclear polyglutamine aggregates. The presence of huntingtin aggregates in a mouse model of Huntington’s disease (R6/2 mice) precedes the onset of symptoms (Davies et al., 1997), suggesting that they may play a contributing role in the neurodegenerative process. There is also data to suggest that there is a correlation between reduction of aggregates and increased viability in cell culture models of Huntington’s disease (Wellington et al., 2000), and other polyglutamine diseases (Kobayashi et al., 2000). These findings have led to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease is due, at least in part, to the formation of these nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates. Further, the presence of protein aggregates has now been reported in almost all polyglutamine repeat diseases suggesting that they may actually be a common pathogenic mechanism for all polyglutamine repeat disorders. However, it has not been demonstrated directly that these aggregates are toxic, and there is data to indicate that aggregates may actually have a protective function (Klement et al., 1998;

Saudou et al., 1998; Kim et al., 1999; Kuemmerle et al., 1999). For example, in Huntington’s disease brain there is dissociation between the cellular distribution of huntingtin aggregates and the selective pattern of striatal neuronal loss (Gutekunst et al., 1999; Kuemmerle et al., 1999). Thus the presence of aggregates cannot explain the selective neuronal vulnerability in Huntington’s disease. Further, the presence of aggregates was predominantly observed in spared interneurons, with few or no aggregates found within the vulnerable spiny striatal neurons suggesting that aggregation of the mHtt may be protective against the polyglutamine-induced neurotoxicity (Kuemmerle et al., 1999). Indeed, inhibition of the formation of nuclear aggregates in a cellular model for Huntington’s disease potentiated the cell death process (Saudou et al., 1998), and SCA1 transgenic mice expressing mutant ataxin-1 lacking the self-association region develop a phenotype typical of ataxia and a selective cellular pathology, but without the presence of apparent ataxin-1 aggregates (Klement et al., 1998). Additionally, in mice expressing mutant ataxin-1 and a target deletion of a ubiquitin protein ligase, nuclear aggregates are significantly reduced compared to the SCA1 mice with normal levels of the ubiquitin protein ligase. However in the ubiquitin protein ligase deficient mice expressing the mutant ataxin-1, cerebellar pathology is markedly worse than in SCA1 mice (Cummings

et al., 1999). These data suggest that aggregates, and in particular nuclear aggregates, are not required for the initiation of cell death, and further that the mutant protein may actually be more toxic if not properly sequestered into an aggregate.

Although the contribution of the protein aggregates to the neurodegenerative processes associated with polyglutamine diseases remains to be elucidated, it is of fundamental importance to determine the mechanisms resulting in aggregates formation, as they are a common feature of almost all the polyglutamine diseases. Two mechanisms have been proposed to explain how expanded polyglutamine domains form insoluble aggregates. First, Perutz and collaborators proposed that the expanded polyglutamine repeats may interact with each other through a ‘polar zipper’ mechanism to form antiparallel β-pleated sheet structures that are highly insoluble (Perutz, 1994; Perutz et al., 1994). Second, because of the role Gln plays in a TG-catalyzed reaction, it was hypothesized that the addition of Gln residues beyond a threshold may result in a protein becoming a TG substrate by more than the proportional increase in the number of residues (Green, 1993).

Thus, an abnormally expanded Gln domain in huntingtin protein may render the mutant protein a TG substrate (even a poor one) and therefore can be crosslinked forming isopeptide bonds and insoluble aggregates. The crosslinked products could be composed not only of the mutant proteins that have acquired the ability to act as glutamyl donors, but also of other proteins that can act as lysyl donors.

### 3.3. tTG levels and TG activity are increased in Huntington’s disease brain

tTG, the most ubiquitous of all the TGs, is found in most mammalian tissues, including the brain (Miller and Anderton, 1986; Johnson et al., 1997; Lesort et al., 1999) where the enzyme is mainly present within the neurons (Lesort et al., 1999). tTG is predominantly a cytosolic enzyme, however its presence in the nucleus has also been reported (Singh et al., 1995; Lesort et al., 1998). Although in resting cells the level of tTG in the nucleus appear relatively low, there is evidence to show that in certain conditions, such as increased intracellular calcium levels, there is a translocation of tTG into
the nucleus (Lesort et al., 1998). If tTG is involved in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease it is reasonable to hypothesize that tTG levels and/or activity are increased in Huntington’s disease. In an early study TG activity was measured in lymphocytes from Huntington’s disease patients and from healthy individuals (Cariello et al., 1996). In ≈25% of the Huntington’s disease cases, TG activity was reported to be above the maximal levels of healthy cases (Cariello et al., 1996). However, in this study TG activity was inversely correlated with the Gln repeat length, with long Gln repeats being associated with relatively low TG activity (Cariello et al., 1996). Although these findings are intriguing, it is likely that the measurement of TG activity in lymphocytes only imperfectly reflects the status of tTG in the brain. Recently two independent studies extended these initial findings by examining TG activity, and tTG levels (Karpuj et al., 1999; Lesort et al., 1999) and localization (Lesort et al., 1999) in Huntington’s disease and control brain. Steinman and colleagues reported that TG activity was significantly increased in the cortex and in the cerebellum of Huntington’s disease cases compared to control cases (Karpuj et al., 1999). TG activity was also greater in cortical nuclear extracts from Huntington’s disease brain compare to control brain (Karpuj et al., 1999). However a more complex picture emerged when tTG levels and TG activity were analyzed in the context of the neuropathological progression of the disease (Lesort et al., 1999). The neuropathological changes in Huntington’s disease have been classified into five grades, progressing from grade 0, in which Huntington’s disease brain show no generalized microscopic abnormalities, to grade 4, in which the most extreme neuronal loss is detected (Lesort et al., 1999). Using biochemical and immunocytochemical methods tTG expression and TG activity were analyzed in the striatum and cortex of Huntington’s disease cases grade 2, 3 and 4, and in control cases free of neurological disease and matched for age and postmortem interval. In the striatum, TG activity was significantly increased in the grade 3 Huntington’s disease cases compared with controls. Immunoblot and immunocytochemistry analysis revealed that the levels of tTG were significantly elevated in the striatum of all Huntington’s disease grades compared with controls (Lesort et al., 1999). In addition, increased tTG immunoreactivity was observed in both medium-sized and large spiny neurons, and was present in both the cytoplasm and the nucleus of the stained neurons (Lesort et al., 1999). In the superior frontal cortex, TG activity was significantly higher in all Huntington’s disease grades compare with controls. Quantitative immunoblot analysis demonstrated that tTG levels in the cortex were elevated in Huntington’s disease grades 2 and 3 cases, and these findings were further supported by the results of the immunocytochemical analysis (Lesort et al., 1999). These results clearly demonstrate that tTG is elevated in Huntington’s disease brains and therefore may play a role in the etiology of the disease. However given that tTG is also up-regulated in several neuronal injury models and neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease (Johnson et al., 1997; Lesort et al., 2000a), increases in tTG may be a generalized response to neuronal stress.

### 3.4. Mitochondria impairment results in an increase in tTG activity

Despite the finding of the mutation responsible for Huntington’s disease, the mechanisms by which the mHtt causes selective cellular vulnerability remain to be elucidated. One hypothesis is that the Huntington’s disease gene defect is associated with impaired mitochondrial energy metabolism, resulting in decreased energy levels in the cells, an increase in oxidative damage, and potentially secondary excitotoxic events (Albin and Greenamyre, 1992; Beal, 1994, 1996). There is significant evidence to support the hypothesis that energy metabolism is impaired in brain regions affected in Huntington’s disease. Early ultrastructural studies of cortical biopsies obtained from patients with either juvenile or adult onset Huntington’s disease showed abnormal mitochondria (Tellez-Nagel et al., 1974; Gobel et al., 1978). Analysis of glucose metabolism in Huntington’s disease patients using positron emission tomography revealed reduced glucose utilization in the basal ganglia and the cerebral cortex, brain regions that are significantly affected in Huntington’s disease (Berent et al., 1988; Kuwert et al., 1990; Martin et al., 1992). These studies also showed that the energy dysfunction precedes the onset of clinical symptoms of the disorder, suggesting that an energy failure may play a primary role in the pathogenesis of Huntington’s disease. Further, biochemical analyses of postmortem Huntington’s disease brain have provided evidence of impaired mitochondrial enzymes activity. For example, early studies reported deficits in pyruvate dehydrogenase and succinate dehydrogenase activities in the striatum of Huntington’s disease cases relative to controls (Butterworth et al., 1985). Other studies have shown that there is a marked reduction in the activity of mitochondrial complexes II, III in the caudate and putamen, and of complex IV in the putamen in Huntington’s disease brain compared to matched controls (Browne et al., 1997). Recently biochemical analysis of a well-characterized transgenic mouse model for Huntington’s disease (R6/2 mice, which express exon 1 of the huntingtin gene with a 150 CAG expansion) demonstrated a significant reduction in the activities of aconitase, an enzyme involved in the Krebs cycle, and mitochondrial complex IV in the striatum and cerebral cortex compared to control mice (Sawa et al., 1999).
Much of the interest in the association of mitochondrial dysfunction with Huntington's disease has emerged from animal studies using mitochondrial toxins such as 3-nitropropionic acid (3-NP). 3-NP, a plant toxin and mycotoxin that has been associated with neurological illness in humans and animals, is an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase and therefore inhibits both the Krebs cycle and mitochondria complex II activity of the electron transport chain (Alston et al., 1977; Coles et al., 1979). Chronic systemic administration of 3-NP to rats results in selective bilateral striatal lesions that share neuropathological and biochemical features characteristic of Huntington's disease, such as sparing of NADPH-diphosphatase positive neurons and significant changes in the dendrites of spiny neurons (Beal et al., 1993). Further, administration of 3-NP to non-human primates resulted in neuropathological and biochemical changes that were similar to those observed in Huntington's disease. For example, 3-NP treatment of non-human primates resulted in the presence of striatal lesions that were strikingly reminiscent of the neurodegenerative pattern that occurs in Huntington's disease brain (Brouillet and Hantraye, 1995; Brouillet et al., 1995). In addition to the selective neurodegeneration, 3-NP treatment caused various dyskinetic movements and dystonic postures similar to the clinical features of Huntington's disease (Brouillet et al., 1995; Palfi et al., 1996). Altogether these results support the hypothesis that mitochondrial dysfunction likely contributes to the pathogenesis of Huntington's disease, however the relation between the energy failure and the genetic mutation in Huntington's disease remains to be elucidated.

Given the fact that TG activity is selectively increased in brain regions affected in Huntington's disease (Karpuj et al., 1999; Lesort et al., 1999), we recently examined the potential contribution of mitochondria dysfunction to the modulation of tTG activity in situ (Lesort et al., 2000b). To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial impairment results in increased TG activity, human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y stably overexpressing human tTG (tTG cells) or mutated inactive tTG (C277S cells), as well as vector transfected cells (pcDNA cells), were incubated in absence or presence of 3-NP, and the in situ TG activity was quantitatively measured (Lesort et al., 2000b). In this study 3-NP treatment resulted in a significant increase in TG activity in tTG-expressing cells, however no significant changes were detected in pcDNA and C277S cells (Fig. 3). In vitro measurements demonstrated that 3-NP has no direct effect on tTG activity. However, 3-NP treatment resulted in a significant decrease in the levels of GTP, a potent inhibitor of the transamidating activity of tTG (Lesort et al., 2000b). Therefore, it is likely that a reduction in intracellular GTP levels increases the activity of tTG. However, depletion in GTP was not solely responsible for the 3-NP-induced increases in tTG activity. The mitochondrion is one of the major sources of free radicals in cells, and there is evidence that 3-NP treatment results in an increase in the production of free radicals (Beal et al., 1995; Schulz et al., 1996; Fontaine et al., 2000). Because previous studies have shown that in vitro oxidation of proteins can increase their susceptibility to tTG-induced modifications (Groenen et al., 1993), the contribution of oxidative stress to the changes in TG activity in situ were also examined. Treatment with 3-NP in combination with GSH ethyl ester or N-acetyl-L-cysteine, two potent antioxidants, significantly reduced the 3-NP-induced increase in in-situ TG activity (Fig. 4) (Lesort et al., 2000b). Thus, mitochondria impairment results in an increase of the in situ tTG activity by mechanism involving a decrease in GTP levels and an increase in oxidative stress conditions (Fig. 5). These findings are intriguing, and suggest that the mitochondrial impairment that occurs in Huntington's disease may result in increases in tTG-catalyzed reactions.

In situ TG activity studies was quantitatively determined in cells stably transfected with the empty vector pcDNA (pcDNA), or with the mutated inactive tTG (C277S), or with the human wild-type tTG (tTG) that have been incubated in the presence (+) or absence (-) of 5mM 3-NP for 48 h. Similar levels of TG activity were detected in cells stably transfected with the empty vector (pcDNA) or with the mutated inactive tTG (C277S), and 3-NP treatment did not significantly affect the in situ TG activity. In SH-SY5Y cells expressing elevated levels of human tTG (tTG), the basal level of the in situ TG activity was significantly higher compared to pcDNA and C277S cells, and 3-NP treatment (+) resulted in a significant increase in endogenous TG activity compared to cells exposed to the vehicle alone (-). Data are presented as mean ± S.E.M. from three separate experiments done in triplicate. Results were considered significantly different when \( P < 0.05 \), (*) significantly different from pcDNA (-), (#) significantly different from tTG (-). Reproduced from Lesort et al.

stretches become tTG substrates has come from in vitro studies. In an initial study small synthetic R₅(Gln)ₙR₅ peptides flanked by residues that are normally adjacent to the polyglutamine sequence in the proteins associated with SCA1, SCA3 and DRPLA, were shown to be good substrates for tTG (Kahlem et al., 1996). In addition, expanding the length of Gln residues made the peptide a better tTG substrate, as long as the peptides remained soluble. Further, when incubated in presence of purified tTG or proteins of brain extracts, the R₅Q₁₈R₅ peptides formed insoluble aggregates and these aggregates contained (γ-glutamyl)lysine bonds (Kahlem et al., 1996). However, in this study only short peptides containing non-pathological stretches (n ≤ 18) of Glu were used. Cooper and colleagues extended these findings by demonstrating that both small, physiological-length polyglutamine (n = 10) domains and longer pathological-length polyglutamine (n = 62) domains expressed as a glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins are good substrates of tTG (Cooper et al., 1997). In fact, both the GSTQ₁₀ and GSTQ₆₂ fusion proteins were better tTG substrates than dimethyl casein, a well-established tTG substrate (Cooper et al., 1997). Furthermore, under the appropriate conditions, the pathological polyglutamine fusion proteins were much better substrates of tTG than physiological polyglutamine fusion proteins (Cooper et al., 1997). Considering these data, it has been suggested that longer polyglutamine domains may synergistically facilitate the modification of Gln residues by tTG (Cooper et al., 1997; Gentile et al., 1998). However, in a larger protein (i.e., huntingtin) access of TG to the polyglutamine domain substrate could be impeded by the tertiary structure of the protein, and therefore short polyglutamine-containing peptides or GSTQₙ fusion proteins may be modified in a way that is not directly relevant to the intact protein or a large protein fragment. To address this issue, extracts from lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from Huntington's disease subjects that expressed in a nearly equal amount wild type and mHtt were used to examine tTG-induced modification of huntingtin. In this study, the full-length huntingtin proteins were found to be in vitro tTG substrates (Kahlem et al., 1998). In fact, when protein extracts of these cells were incubated in presence of purified guinea pig liver tTG or a rat brain extract containing TGs, the mHtt protein was found to be a better in vitro tTG-substrate than the wild type huntingtin (Kahlem et al., 1998). Furthermore, TG-catalyzed cross-linking of mHtt was almost completely prevented in the presence of EDTA, or in presence of cystamine (Kahlem et al., 1998), which is known to competitively inhibit TGs in vitro. Because in vitro tTG catalyzed a reaction that specifically resulted in the

Fig. 4. Oxidative stress is a contributing factor to the mitochondrial dysfunction-increased in situ TG activity. tTG cells were treated with 5 mM 3-NP in combination with GSH (50 μM) or NAC (100 μM). In situ TG activity was significantly increased after exposure to 3-NP for 48 h. When the cells were treated with 3-NP in combination with GSH or NAC, a partial inhibition of the increase in TG activity was detected. Data are means ± S.E.M.

Fig. 5. Schematic diagram of the mechanisms contributing to the increase of the in situ TG activity in response to mitochondria impairment. Treatment with 3-NP, an irreversible inhibitor of succinate dehydrogenase, results in an impairment of mitochondrial function, leading to a decrease in the cellular levels of two tTG inhibitors, ATP and to a greater extent ATP. In addition mitochondrial dysfunction is associated with increased oxidative stress, which can result in the modification of specific proteins making them better substrates for tTG, and this could contribute to the enhanced tTG-modification of protein in situ. Finally, mitochondria dysfunction potentiated the increase of the in situ TG activity in response to an elevation in intracellular calcium levels. These findings may have potential implications in the context of Huntington’s disease.

3.5. Polyglutamine domains are good tTG-substrates in vitro

The majority of evidence supporting the hypothesis that mutant proteins containing polyglutamine
disappearance of the mHtt and its replacement by polymeric forms, the authors suggested that the effects of tTG imitated Huntington's disease in the affected brain regions (Kahlem et al., 1998).

### 3.6. Does huntingtin proteins interact with tTG in situ?

As discussed above, polyglutamine domains and huntingtin are modified by tTG in vitro suggesting that tTG could have a role in the etiology of Huntington's disease by modifying the mHtt protein. However, to our knowledge it has never been demonstrated that mHtt protein and tTG associate in situ, nor has it been demonstrated that in situ the mHtt is a tTG substrate. To test these hypothesis we established several SH-SY5Y cell lines expressing full-length, truncated (containing the first 550 amino acids), or highly truncated (containing the first 63 amino acids) huntingtin with either physiological or pathological lengths of Gln repeats. Human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells are a particularly good model system, as treatment of these cells with retinoic acid (20 μM, 5 days) results in a robust increase in tTG expression (Zhang et al., 1998b) without altering the levels or the processing of full-length or truncated huntingtin proteins (Chun et al.,

2000, 2001a,b). Further, retinoic acid treatment of SH-SY5Y cells results in differentiation into a neuronal-like phenotype (Vignali et al., 1996; Encinas et al., 1999). Using these stably transfected cells we examined the potential interaction between huntingtin proteins and tTG. We demonstrated that both wild type and mutant full-length huntingtin interact only very weakly with tTG. In contrast, there was a significant interaction between the truncated huntingtin (550 residues) and tTG, and this interaction was similar in cells expressing both wild type and mutant truncated huntingtin. Further, activation of tTG resulted in an increased association between truncated huntingtin and tTG (Chun et al., 2001b). In cells expressing the highly truncated huntingtin (63 residues) a significant interaction between highly truncated wild type huntingtin and tTG was detected, however there was only a weak association between the mutant highly truncated huntingtin and tTG, and in both cell lines increasing tTG activity did not change these interactions (Chun et al., 2001a). These data suggest that proteolysis of full-length mHtt resulting in a relatively large breakdown product likely precedes its interaction with tTG in situ. Indeed, the size of the truncated huntingtin that interacted with tTG is approximately the size of a fragment of huntingtin that is generated by caspase-3 in vitro (cleavage sites have been identified at D513 and D552; Wellington et al., 1998). Therefore, in Huntington's disease an increase in caspase activity could result in an increased association between tTG and a mHtt fragment.

#### 3.7. Is huntingtin or huntingtin-associated proteins modified by tTG in situ?

The in situ association between tTG and truncated huntingtin suggests that huntingtin may be an in situ substrate of tTG. To test the hypothesis that huntingtin is an in situ tTG substrate, cell lines expressing wild type or mutant full-length, truncated or highly truncated huntingtin were pretreated with retinoic acid to increase tTG levels, loaded with 5-(biotinamido)-pentylamine, and then incubated in absence or presence of the calcium mobilizing agent maitotoxin to activate tTG (Zhang et al., 1998b). Cell lysates were collected and huntingtin or truncated huntingtin proteins were immunoprecipitated. The tTG catalyzed incorporation of 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine into protein substrates was detected with strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase and used to identify the proteins modified by tTG in situ. The results of these studies clearly demonstrate that neither mutant nor wild type huntingtin (full length, truncated or highly truncated) is a tTG substrate in situ. However, proteins that are associated specifically with the truncated mutant, but not wild type, huntingtin are selectively polyaminated by tTG (Chun et al., 2000, 2001a,b). Identical results were

Fig. 6. tTG selectively modifies proteins that are associated with the mutant truncated huntingtin. Cells stably transfected with a construct expressing the first 550 amino acid of huntingtin containing either 23 Gln (Q23 cells) or 62 Gln (Q62 cells) were transiently transfected with a wild-type tTG construct (Tucholski et al., 1999). Forty-eight hours after the cells were labeled with 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine, and incubated in the absence (−) or presence (+) of maitotoxin (MTX). MTX is a calcium mobilizing agent, and we have previously demonstrated that exposure of RA-treated SH-SY5Y cells to MTX resulted in a robust increase in tTG activity (Zhang et al., 1998a,b). Huntingtin was immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal huntingtin antibody, then the precipitates were immunoblotted with a monoclonal huntingtin antibody (MAB2166, Chemicon) (left panel). The blots were stripped and reprobed with neutravidin-HRP, which recognizes proteins that have incorporated 5-(biotinamido)pentylamine and therefore been modified by tTG (right panel). Similar amount of huntingtin was immunoprecipitated in the Q23 and Q62 cells exposed to MTX, however activated-tTG resulted only in selective modification of proteins that are specifically associated with the mutant truncated huntingtin protein. The expression of exogenous tTG was the same for all cells and treatment groups (data not shown).
obtained when the cells expressing wild type or mutant truncated huntingtin were transiently transfected with a tTG construct (Fig. 6). These findings are quite intriguing, and likely have significant relevance in the context of Huntington’s disease as several investigators have proposed that the disease could be caused at least in part by abnormal protein–protein interactions related to the abnormal polyglutamine stretch in huntingtin. In addition, several of the proteins that selectively associate with mutant polyglutamine proteins have polyglutamine or Gln-rich domains and therefore could be tTG substrates. For example, the transcriptional co-activators CREB binding proteins (McCampbell et al., 2000; Steffan et al., 2000) and TAFII130 (Shimohata et al., 2000) have polyglutamine and/or Gln-rich domains and selectively interact with mutant polyglutamine proteins. These data suggest that tTG, which interacts with mutant and wild type truncated huntingtin equally as well, may polyaminate specific proteins that selectively interact with a proteolytic fragment of mHtt. Previous studies have shown that proteins are polyaminated by TGs in vitro (Miller and Johnson, 1995; Ikura et al., 1998; Lesort et al., 2000a) and in vivo (Beninati et al., 1988; Piacentini et al., 1988; Tucholski et al., 1999), and as discussed above, there is evidence that incorporation of polyamines into specific protein substrates can alter their function and/or metabolism. Therefore, it can be hypothesized that the tTG-catalyzed polyamination of specific proteins that are selectively associated with the mutant truncated huntingtin alters the function and/or localization of these proteins, and hence contributes to the etiology of Huntington’s disease.

### 3.8. Does tTG contribute to aggregate formation in situ?

It has been hypothesized that tTG may contribute to aggregate formation in Huntington’s disease brain by catalyzing the formation of covalent crosslinks with the Glus of the mHtt serving as the acyl donors (Kahlem et al., 1998; Cooper et al., 1999). In support of this hypothesis is the fact that TG activity and tTG levels are elevated in brain regions affected in Huntington’s disease (Karpuj et al., 1999; Lesort et al., 1999) and that in vitro, mHtt and polyglutamine peptides are in general good tTG substrates (Kahlem et al., 1996; Cooper et al., 1997; Kahlem et al., 1998). However, the distribution of aggregates in Huntington’s disease brain (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998; Kuemmerle et al., 1999) does not correlate well with the observed increases in tTG levels and TG activity (Karpuj et al., 1999; Lesort et al., 1999). For example, the elevation of tTG in Huntington’s disease cases is similar in the cortex and striatum (Lesort et al., 1999), however aggregates are much more predominant in the cortex (Gutekunst et al., 1999; Kuemmerle et al., 1999). Additionally, elevations in TG have been reported in the cerebellum (Karpuj et al., 1999) which is only mildly involved, if at all, in Huntington’s disease (Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998). Further, in situ, huntingtin is apparently not modified by tTG (see above). However, these studies only indirectly address the role of tTG in the formation of mHtt aggregates.

If tTG is a determining factor to the formation of aggregates, then selective decreases or increases in the level and/or activity of the enzyme should affect the frequency of aggregates. In a previous study, transient transfection of COS 7 cells with a truncated DRPLA protein containing an expanded polyglutamine domain resulted in the presence of aggregates and an increase in apoptotic cell death (Igarashi et al., 1998). Treatment of these cells with either cystamine or monodansylcadaverine, suppressed aggregate formation and apoptosis (Igarashi et al., 1998). Although interesting, cystamine and monodansylcadaverine are not specific TG inhibitors, and can inhibit other thiol enzymes (such as the caspases), (Lorand, 1998). Unfortunately, there is at present no highly selective, membrane permeable TG inhibitors making results from these type of experiments difficult to interpret. Indeed, monodansylcadaverine reduced apoptotic cell death but was ineffective in blocking the formation of aggregates (Igarashi et al.,

![Figure 7](#fig7)

**Fig. 7.** tTG overexpression does not affect the frequency of huntingtin aggregates. N-Q82 cells were incubated in the absence or presence of 20 μM retinoic acid (RA) for 5 days. Treatment with RA (+RA) results in a robust increase in tTG expression levels compared to cells treated in absence of RA (−RA) (A). The frequency and the localization (cytoplasmic and/or nucleus) of the aggregates was quantified in N-Q82 cells that express low tTG levels (−RA) or high tTG levels (+RA) (B). Approximately 17 and 15% of cells formed aggregates in RA non-treated and in RA-treated cells, respectively. There were no significant changes in the frequency and/or localization of aggregate in cells expressing a high level of tTG (+RA) compared to cells expressing endogenous level of tTG (−RA) (B). Data represent three independent experiments with total counts of 762 and 913 cells in non-RA-treated and RA-treated cells, respectively.

In cells stably expressing N-Q18, huntingtin (a) and tTG immunoreactivities (b) were diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and did not show specific colocalization (c). In contrast, N-Q82 cells showed large huntingtin immunoreactive aggregates (d). In these cells tTG immunoreactivity was also diffuse throughout the cytoplasm and remarkably was completely excluded from the huntingtin aggregates (e, f).

In cells stably transfected with the antisense tTG construct the levels of tTG was undetectable by western blot analysis, even after a long exposure (A).

immunostaining throughout the cytoplasm and neu-
rites, and increasing tTG levels by treating the cells
with retinoic acid did not change this distribution
(Chun et al., 2001a,b). In cell expressing the pathologi-
cal highly truncated huntingtin immunocytochemical
analysis revealed the presence of large aggregates in
≈17% of the cells that were mostly in the cytoplasm
but also in the nucleus (Figs. 1 and 7B). Immunoblot
analysis demonstrated that these aggregates are SDS-re-
sistant as huntingtin positive material was observed at
the very top of the gels (Chun et al., 2001a,b). How-
ever, retinoic acid treatment of these cells, and therefore
increases in tTG levels, did not affect the frequency or
the localization of these aggregates (Fig. 7B) (Chun et
al., 2001a,b). To determine whether tTG co-localized
with the highly truncated huntingtin, co-staining was
carried out with a polyclonal antibody to the N-termi-
nal of huntingtin and a monoclonal tTG antibody
(TG100, Neomarkers). In cell lines transfected with the
wild type truncated huntingtin, both huntingtin and
tTG immunoreactivities were diffuse through the cyto-
plasm and showed no specific co-localization (Fig. 8).
In cells transfected with the pathological highly trun-
cated huntingtin there was also no specific colocaliza-
tion of tTG and huntingtin and moreover, tTG
immunoreactivity was completely excluded from the
aggregates (Fig. 8) (Chun et al., 2001a,b). To further
analyze the role of tTG in the formation of mHtt
aggregates, a YFP-tagged highly truncated mHtt con-
struct containing 82 Gln repeats (YFP-HT Q82) was
transiently transfected into cells stably transfected with
the empty vector pcDNA3.1 or into cells stably trans-
fected with an antisense tTG construct (Fig. 9A). In the
antisense tTG cells, tTG is undetectable by western-blot
analysis and there is no measurable TG activity (Tu-
cholski et al., 2001). As expected, transient transfection
of YFP-HT Q82 into the pcDNA cells resulted in the
presence of cytoplasmic aggregates (Fig. 9B). When the
YFP-HT Q82 construct was transiently transfected in
the antisense tTG, cells the presence and frequency of
aggregates was the same as that which occurred in the
pcDNA cells (Fig. 9B) (Chun et al., 2001a,b). These
data clearly demonstrate that tTG is not essential to the
formation of mHtt aggregates in situ.

4. Summary

It is clear that tTG levels and activity increase in
Huntington's disease brain. However, the exact role(s)
of tTG in the etiology of Huntington's disease remain
unclear. At present it seems unlikely that tTG plays a
significant role in the formation of aggregates in Hunt-
ington's disease brain. Nonetheless, tTG may con-
tribute to the etiology of the Huntington's disease, as
well as other polyglutamine diseases, by modifying

proteins that selectively interact with the mutant polyglutamine containing proteins. In Fig. 10 a diagram is presented summarizing the possible contributing role of tTG in the etiology of Huntington’s disease. However, further investigations are clearly necessary to establish the role of tTG in Huntington’s disease.
