## Programmed cell death as a defence against infection

**Ine Jorgensen**${}^{1}$, **Manira Rayamajhi**${}^{2}$ and **Edward A. Miao**${}^{3}$

### Abstract | Eukaryotic cells can die from physical trauma, which results in necrosis. Alternatively, they can die through programmed cell death upon the stimulation of specific signalling pathways. In this Review, we discuss the role of different cell death pathways in innate immune defence against bacterial and viral infection: apoptosis, necroptosis, pyroptosis and NETosis. We describe the interactions that interweave different programmed cell death pathways, which create complex signalling networks that cross-guard each other in the evolutionary ‘arms race’ with pathogens. Finally, we describe how the resulting cell corpses — apoptotic bodies, pore-induced intracellular traps (PITs) and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) — promote the clearance of infection.

### Apoptosis
A common form of cell death. Many physiological and developmental stimuli cause apoptosis, and this mechanism is frequently used to delete unwanted, superfluous or potentially harmful cells, such as those undergoing transformation.

### Necroptosis
Programmed lytic cell death via RIPK3 activation of MLKL.

---

Cell death can be either programmed or accidental. Programmed cell death results in either lytic or non-lytic morphology, depending on the signalling pathway involved. For example, apoptosis${}^{1,2}$ is a non-lytic and usually immunologically silent form of cell death. Conversely, programmed lytic cell death is highly inflammatory, and includes necroptosis${}^{3-5}$, pyroptosis${}^{6}$ and the rapid release of so-called neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) in a process known as NETosis${}^{7}$. The elimination of host immune cells by programmed cell death can be thought to benefit an infecting pathogen${}^{8}$. However, programmed cell death is being increasingly understood to benefit the host (for example, by eliminating the intracellular niche of certain pathogens${}^{9}$). Furthermore, the resulting cellular corpses coordinate an appropriate innate immune response to promote the resolution of infection. However, as our understanding of innate immune defences is mainly based on work with pathogens that evade these defences, it is often difficult to recognize how programmed cell death functions in response to infections. Indeed, many discoveries of cell death functions are based on experiments with pathogens that have been genetically modified to remove their normal host-evasion strategies.

Substantial crosstalk exists between different cell death pathways and, as a result, innate immune signalling pathways are well guarded against pathogen attack. The ‘guard hypothesis’ was first developed from studies on plant immunity, in which it has been shown that innate immune sensors monitor for the perturbation of other innate immune signalling pathways${}^{10}$. For example, in *Arabidopsis thaliana*, pathogens often attempt to inhibit key proteins that are involved in innate immune signalling. When pathogens target one such protein, RPM1-INTERACTING PROTEIN 4 (RIN4), the perturbation is detected by two different nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptors (NLRs), which activate programmed cell death — a phenomenon that is known as the hypersensitive response in plants — to combat the pathogen${}^{11,12}$. This guard mechanism is echoed in mammalian programmed cell death pathways, which function to guard each other, as well as other innate immune signalling pathways.

In this Review, we discuss how the host uses programmed cell death to fight infections with a focus on *in vivo* studies. We also discuss how difficult, but not impossible, it can be for pathogens to evade programmed cell death owing to the guard functions that are built into the signalling pathways. The roles of pyroptosis, necroptosis and apoptosis during infection are also discussed, as well as how these signalling pathways are functionally interwoven to guard each other. Finally, we discuss the fate of dead cell corpses, such as apoptotic bodies, NETs and pore-induced intracellular traps (PITs), and how their physical properties are beneficial to fighting infections.

### Inflammasomes trigger pyroptosis
Inflammasomes are cytosolic sensors that activate caspase 1 (REF. 13). Once activated, caspase 1 cleaves pro-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms, and cleaves gasdermin D (encoded by GSDMD) to induce pore opening and pyroptosis (FIG. 1). Inflammasomes are cytoplasmic platforms that are composed of NLR proteins, AIM2-like receptor (ALR) proteins or tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins that detect the contamination of the cytosol by DNA, bacterial flagellin, the type 3 secretion system (T3SS) needle and rod subunits, toxins and cellular perturbations. Mouse caspase 11 — which is duplicated in humans as caspase 4 and caspase 5 — also induces

Figure 1 | Pyroptosis in response to infection. Pyroptosis is initiated by either caspase 1 or caspase 11. Caspase 1 is activated by one of several inflammasomes, NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), AIM2, interferon-γ (IFNγ)-inducible protein 16 (IFI16), pyrin, NLR family, CARD-containing 4 (NLRC4) and NLRP1b. NLRP3 responds to numerous agonists, which may converge upon low cellular potassium concentration, although this remains controversial. NLRP3 will not respond to these agonists unless it also receives a priming stimulus through various Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or from tumour necrosis factor (TNF), which trigger post-translational priming (probably deubiquitylation (De-Ub)), as well as boosting NLRP3 sensitivity by transcriptional induction. AIM2 detects cytosolic DNA, and IFI16, which lacks a clear mouse homologue, also detects viral nucleic acids. Pyrin detects the modulation of Rho family GTPases by bacterial toxins such as Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). NLRC4 is activated by one of three bacterial flagellin or type III secretion system (T3SS) rod or needle proteins that signal via an upstream NLR in the NAIP family. NLRP1b detects the protease activity of the anthrax lethal toxin. By contrast, caspase 11 is itself the sensor for cytosolic lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Similar to NLRP3, caspase 11 requires priming, but priming is by either type I interferon or interferon-γ (IFNγ). Either caspase 1 or caspase 11 independently cleaves gasdermin D, from which the released amino-terminal fragment associates with the cell membrane and oligomerizes to form the pyroptotic pore. The cell then swells, resulting in membrane rupture that is known as pyroptosis. In addition, caspase 1 will cleave pro-interleukin-1β (pro-IL-1β) and pro-IL-18 to their mature forms (caspase 11 cannot do this directly). Mature IL-1β and IL-18 can escape through the gasdermin D pore, or can be released later by membrane rupture.

Caspase 11 directly detects lipopolysaccharide (LPS) when it enters the cytosol, and thus protects against infection by cytosol-invasive Gram-negative bacteria, such as Burkholderia thailandensis, but can be evaded by pathogens such as Francisella novicida and Shigella flexneri. Caspases 4, 5 and 11 are often called the non-canonical inflammasome. The role of inflammasomes in pyroptosis has been reviewed in detail and is summarized in FIG. 1.

Recently, two research groups independently discovered that caspase 1 and caspase 11 cleave gasdermin D, and this cleavage is required to trigger pyroptosis. This finding was later confirmed by a third research

group²³. Interestingly, the cleavage of gasdermin D was observed a few years earlier, but its importance remained uninvestigated²⁴. Gasdermin D is a member of the greater gasdermin-domain protein family, consisting of 6 members in humans and 10 in mice²⁵. The function of other gasdermin family members remains to be further elucidated, and although many probably induce pyroptosis²¹, it remains unclear how they are activated.

Gasdermins are bipartite proteins the amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains of which are connected by a linker, and they have several proposed roles in immune-related diseases²⁵. Caspase 1 or caspase 11 cleave this linker of gasdermin D, releasing the N-terminal domain²¹,²², which then associates with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and oligomerizes to form pores. These pores range in size from 10 nm to 33 nm²⁶–²⁹, which is just large enough to allow the passage of mature IL-1β (which is 4.5 nm)²⁶,²⁸; this could explain how IL-1β can be released from cells that do not lyse, which might hypothetically occur if a very low number of gasdermin D pores form. Small, but detectable, amounts of IL-1β may escape through these pores while small amounts of sodium and water enter. The resulting mild cell swelling should be counteracted by regulatory volume decrease mechanisms, preventing membrane rupture³⁰. Later, the cell could remove the pores by normal membrane repair processes³¹. Conversely, if more gasdermin D pores form, considerable swelling should overwhelm the regulatory volume decrease, resulting in membrane rupture that we refer to as pyroptosis, and the release of any remaining processed IL-1β from the cytosol. The N-terminal domain of gasdermin D has affinity not only for the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, but also for other phospholipids and cardiolipin²⁶–²⁸,³², which suggests that it may also target organelles. In this regard, the permeabilization of the endoplasmic reticulum may explain the calcium flux that occurs during pyroptosis³³,³⁴.

Although numerous pathogens trigger pyroptosis *in vitro*, the role of pyroptosis *in vivo* is much less well studied. Mice deficient in caspase 1 have an increased susceptibility to a variety of pathogens (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). The importance of pyroptosis *in vivo* is primarily inferred from comparing the resistance to infection of *Casp1⁻/⁻* mice with that of *Il1b⁻/⁻Il18⁻/⁻* mice. This comparison remains to be made for many pathogens. The recently generated *Gsdmd⁻/⁻* mice are defective for both pyroptosis and the release of IL-1β and IL-18 (at least *in vitro*)²¹–²³, so a genetic approach to inhibit pyroptosis while maintaining cytokine secretion remains elusive. Finally, it is important to remember that defence against infection may require IL-1β, IL-18 and pyroptosis in conjunction³⁵.

### Pyroptosis defends against intracellular bacteria

The most direct evidence for pyroptosis in clearing infections comes from the investigation of bacterial strains engineered to activate the NLR family, CARD-containing 4 (NLRC4) inflammasome and induce pyroptosis *in vivo*. Normally, *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium and *Listeria monocytogenes* efficiently evade inflammasomes during the systemic phase of infection in mice⁹,³⁶–³⁹. By contrast, strains that are engineered to persistently express flagellin are detected by NLRC4 and are rapidly cleared. The observation that mice deficient in IL-1β and IL-18 could still clear these flagellin-engineered bacteria suggests that pyroptosis is the primary mechanism for bacterial clearance⁹,³⁶–³⁸. Similarly, caspase 11 provides *in vivo* defence against *S.* Typhimurium strains (*sifA* mutants) that have lost the ability to maintain the integrity of the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole and thus aberrantly enter the cytosol¹⁸. After pyroptosis *in vitro*, bacteria are damaged⁴⁰, perhaps by gasdermin D pores²⁸, and are more susceptible to secondary insults, such as hydrogen peroxide or antibiotics⁴⁰. However, the physiological relevance of this observation remains unclear, as pyroptosis and gasdermin D are insufficient to kill intracellular bacteria *in vivo*⁹. Instead, after pyroptosis in mice, bacteria are transferred to neutrophils, where they are killed by reactive oxygen species (ROS)⁹,⁴⁰.

Pyroptosis also protects against non-engineered, opportunistic microorganisms *in vivo*, including *Chromobacterium violaceum*, *B. thailandensis*, *Burkholderia pseudomallei* and *F. novicida*¹⁸,¹⁹,³⁹,⁴¹,⁴². However, additional supporting data are needed to confirm this protection⁴³. Among these bacteria, *B. thailandensis* and *C. violaceum* have the strongest phenotypes of all tested pathogens in inflammasome-deficient mice¹⁹,³⁹ (see Supplementary information S1 (table))⁴⁴. As few as 100 colony-forming units (CFUs) of *C. violaceum* or *B. thailandensis* are lethal to inflammasome-deficient mice, whereas wild-type mice survive challenges by 1,000,000 to 20,000,000 CFUs. The strength of these phenotypes leads us to propose that, despite their evasion by host-adapted pathogens, inflammasomes may be maintained over evolutionary time owing to their crucial role in defence against pathogens that are co-evolving with a non-mammalian host that lacks inflammasome defences. Thus, some ubiquitous environmental bacteria have specific virulence traits that are capable of manipulating a generic eukaryotic cell, making them potentially lethal pathogens. However, they are unprepared for the mammalian innate immune system, including inflammasome-driven responses (BOX 1; see further discussion in REF. 44).

Additionally, inflammasomes provide defence against microorganisms that have adapted to mammalian hosts. For example, although *S.* Typhimurium efficiently evades inflammasomes during systemic infection, these bacteria are detected in the gut⁴⁵. Intestinal epithelial cell NLRC4 triggers epithelial cell shedding during infection. Whether this process is a precursor stage during pyroptosis, or is fully independent of pyroptosis, requires further study⁴⁵. Caspase 11 seems to have a similar, parallel role in epithelial shedding to eliminate the low frequency but rapidly replicating subpopulation of *S.* Typhimurium that aberrantly enter the cytosol⁴⁶.

### Pyroptosis during viral infection

Inflammasomes also induce pyroptosis *in vitro* following the detection of viruses, such as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) through the double-stranded DNA-detecting cytosolic sensor AIM2. Parallel *in vivo* studies show that
Aim2$^{-/-}$ mice are susceptible to MCMV infection${}^{47}$. However, whether this susceptibility arises from pyroptosis, IL-1β or IL-18 remains to be explored. Conversely, a detrimental effect of pyroptosis has been described during HIV infection. Interferon-γ (IFNγ)-inducible protein 16 (IFI16) — which is an AIM2-like receptor that detects viral nucleic acids — induces pyroptosis in CD4⁺ T cells abortively infected by HIV${}^{48}$. This has been proposed as the major pathway by which HIV depletes CD4⁺ T cells *in vivo*${}^{49,50}$. Conversely, IFI16 has also been suggested to have a beneficial role in the defence against HIV infection, although pyroptosis was not examined as a possible mechanism${}^{51}$.

**RIPK3 triggers necroptosis**

Necroptosis, similar to pyroptosis, is a form of programmed lytic cell death. Necroptosis can be triggered by various intricate pathways (discussed below), although perhaps the simplest pathway is through Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1; also known as DAI and DLM-1).

**Induction of necroptosis by ZBP1.** ZBP1 binds either Z-DNA or Z-RNA using two Z-DNA-binding motifs, and can respond to DNA viruses, such as MCMV, or to RNA viruses, such as influenza virus${}^{52-54}$. Unlike the normal B-form of DNA, Z-form DNA results from torsional strain that may occur during rapid DNA synthesis that could happen during viral infection. Once activated, its receptor-interacting protein (RIP) homotypic interaction motif (RHIM) binds the RHIM of RIP kinase 3 (RIPK3)${}^{52}$. This interaction stimulates RIPK3 kinase activity, auto-phosphorylation and oligomerization${}^{55-57}$, and RIPK3 phosphorylates the necroptosis effector mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL)${}^{58}$ (FIG. 2). Following phosphorylation by RIPK3, the MLKL pseudokinase undergoes a conformational switch${}^{59}$, licensing interaction with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane where MLKL oligomerizes to form the necrotic pore${}^{60-62}$, which is analogous to gasdermin D for pyroptosis. Additional steps may also regulate MLKL${}^{63}$. After pore formation, the terminal events in necroptosis are similar to those in pyroptosis; osmotic pressure from ion and water influx results in the rupture of the plasma membrane. In our experiments, pyroptosis and necroptosis (both at 2 hours post-treatment) are morphologically identical in primary macrophages${}^{40}$, with the exception of slightly different nuclear morphology (I.J. and E.A.M., unpublished observations). Other research laboratories have visualized differences in RAW264.7 macrophages in settings where pyroptosis is fast (2 hours) while necroptosis is slow (4 hours)${}^{32}$. The morphologies in comparison deserve further study. Necroptosis can be investigated *in vivo* using $Ripk3^{-/-}$ or $Mlkl^{-/-}$ mice; however, RIPK3 has been suggested to have non-necroptotic functions during influenza virus infection${}^{64}$ and during inflammatory disease models${}^{65}$. Therefore, before attributing a phenotype to necroptosis, it is important to verify that phenotypes observed in $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice are also seen in $Mlkl^{-/-}$ mice.

**Necroptosis defends against viral infections.** The clearest phenotypes for necroptosis during *in vivo* infection highlight an antiviral role. MCMV encodes a viral

**Box 1 | Hypothesis to explain the importance of inflammasomes despite evasion by pathogens**

In Lewis Carroll’s *Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There*${}^{156}$, Alice finds herself in a race with the Red Queen, in which “it takes all the running you can do, to keep in the same place.” This inspired the evolutionary hypothesis that constant change is required to survive within a constantly changing environmental niche alongside constantly changing competitors. But in the end, each organism tends to maintain its place within the niche. This concept applies to the host–pathogen interaction: as hosts (analogously to Alice) evolve new immune responses, pathogens (analogously to the Red Queen) evolve virulence factors to overcome them. For example, numerous pathogens evade inflammasome detection${}^{157}$. Thus, many successful pathogens seem to be perpetually one step ahead in the evolutionary equilibrium between inflammasome detection and evasion. Conversely, aberrant inflammasome activation can be lethal${}^{15,16,34}$, which might select for the loss of these sensors over time. One must ask, then, why would ‘Alice’ run with inflammasomes that fail to fight the ‘Red Queen’?

Interestingly, there are two pathogens that inflammasomes decisively control *in vivo*: *Burkholderia thailandensis*${}^{19}$ and *Chromobacterium violaceum*${}^{39}$ (see Supplementary information S1 (table))${}^{44}$. Both use substantial virulence traits that make them lethal to inflammasome-deficient mice and immunocompromised humans. However, in healthy animals, inflammasomes render them harmless. *B. thailandensis* and *C. violaceum* are ubiquitous soil and mud bacteria the natural host of which remains unknown; perhaps it is a lower eukaryote that lacks inflammasomes, such as insects or nematodes.

This leads us to propose a corollary to the Red Queen hypothesis. We propose that *C. violaceum* and *B. thailandensis* are not running an evolutionary race alongside humans because they are not natural human pathogens. Instead, they run a completely separate race altogether, alongside a non-human host. They may occasionally lose their way and clumsily ‘stumble’ onto the human ‘racecourse’, where they find themselves brushed aside by inflammasomes. Hence, the mammalian innate immune response is perpetually winning the evolutionary race against environmental pathogens that may be dangerous but that lack sophisticated immune evasion strategies.

This confluence of races could explain why inflammasomes are maintained over evolutionary time despite the prevalence of evasive pathogens. Inflammasomes may act as a barrier to prevent opportunistic infection. Such a barrier may not be perfect, as *B. thailandensis* has two close relatives that have advanced on to the pathway to mammalian pathogenesis — environmental bacteria that have evolved into Red Queens. *Burkholderia pseudomallei* is broadly pathogenic to mammals and causes melioidosis${}^{158}$. Further along the adaptation course is *Burkholderia mallei*, which is the highly virulent equine-adapted cause of glanders${}^{159}$. Further caveats to this hypothesis are described in REF. 44.

Our hypothesis thus predicts that certain innate immune sensors provide a near-permanent victory for the host in defence against a large reservoir of potentially deadly environmental pathogens, while host-adapted pathogens must evade these sensors.

Figure 2 | Apoptosis and necroptosis. Apoptosis can be triggered through intrinsic or extrinsic pathways, including by natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte granzymes. These stimulate the cleavage of BID to tBID, which causes BAX and/or BAK to trigger mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in the release of cytochrome c, which binds to apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1) (not shown). APAF1 then oligomerizes into the apoptosome, the platform for caspase 9 activation. Either caspase 8 or caspase 9 will cleave the effector caspases caspase 3 and caspase 7 into their active forms, which leads to apoptosis². Necroptosis can be triggered by Z-DNA or Z-RNA sensing via Z-DNA binding protein 1 (ZBP1)⁵², which activates receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) followed by the phosphorylation of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL). Phosphorylated MLKL binds to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane and forms the necrotic pore⁶⁰⁻⁶². In the more complex necroptotic pathway, tumour necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFR1), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)–TRIF and TLR4–TRIF signal via RIPK1 to activate NF-κB (not shown), but RIPK1 is not required for the TRIF-type I IFN response⁹⁷,⁹⁸. RIPK1 can be thought of as a finely balanced see-saw with two guards: caspase 8 on one side, which is balanced by a duo of RIPK3 and ZBP1 on the other side. When TNFR1– TLR3–TLR4 signalling proceeds normally, RIPK1 is ‘balanced’ and functions as a scaffolding protein that becomes poly- ubiquitlated, and serves as a platform for signalling complex assembly⁵ that drives transcriptional responses. When signalling is inhibited, for example, by the inhibition of cIAP1/2 pharmacological inhibitors (with SMAC mimetics), by the inhibition of TAK1, by the inhibition of protein synthesis, by blocking RIPK1 ubiquitylation³, or potentially by virulence factors, RIPK1 becomes ‘unbalanced’. RIPK1 then recruits FAS-associated death domain (FADD; a DD-DED (death effector domain)) via DD–DD interactions, and FADD recruits caspase 8 via DED–DED interactions, thereby triggering extrinsic apoptosis¹⁷³⁻¹⁷⁵. Successful caspase 8 activation provides negative feedback to prevent necroptosis by cleaving RIPK1 and RIPK3 in the kinase domains¹⁷⁶,¹⁷⁷. However, the inhibition of caspase 8 pharmacologically or through viral virulence factors permits continued RIPK1 kinase activity, and the see-saw tips in the other direction. RIPK1 recruits RIPK3 via RHIM–RHIM interaction, and phosphorylates it, triggering RIPK3 kinase activity and necroptosis¹⁷⁸⁻¹⁸⁰. Thus, RIPK1, RIPK3 and caspase 8 act as a cross-guard system for TNFR1, TLR3 and TLR4. TLRs such as TLR2 do not signal through TRIF⁷⁶,¹⁰⁰,¹⁰⁸,¹¹⁴, unless longer time points are examined⁷⁵, during which TLR2-driven TNF could require caspase 8 to cause paracrine TNFR1 stimulation.

inhibitor of RIP activation (vIRA), the RHIM domain mimic of which inhibits RIPK3 signalling, and thereby prevents necroptosis⁵². A RHIM domain mutant virus is attenuated, but this attenuation is reversed in *Ripk3*⁻/⁻ and *Zbp1*⁻/⁻ mice⁵². Similarly, human-adapted herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 express two protein homologues, ICP6 and ICP10, that inhibit human RIPK3 (REFS 66,67). However, there seems to be some degree of species tropism; human HSV-1 ICP6 interacts with mouse RIPK3, presumably attempting to inhibit it, but owing to the species mismatch, RIPK3 is activated, which triggers necroptosis to prevent viral replication⁶⁶⁻⁶⁸. Accordingly, *Ripk3*⁻/⁻ mice are susceptible to HSV-1 infection⁶⁹. This idea does not hold true for MCMV, which inhibits necroptosis in both human and mouse cells⁶⁶.

REVIEWS

The antiviral role for necroptosis is further supported by the observation that $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice are susceptible to vaccinia virus infection ${ }^{56}$. The RIPK3 pathway also defends against a mouse-adapted influenza virus infection. $Zbp1^{-/-}$ and $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice have increased mortality during infection with the PR8 strain of influenza A virus ${ }^{54,64}$. However, the susceptibility of $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice to influenza virus was not replicated in another study ${ }^{70}$, and a third study showed the reverse, with $Zbp1^{-/-}$ mice having higher viral titres but reduced tissue damage and mortality ${ }^{53}$, suggesting a simultaneously beneficial role in defence paired with a detrimental role in immunopathology.

Finally, $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice have normal resistance to mouse hepatitis virus ${ }^{71}$. Many other mouse viral infection models remain to be examined in $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice and $Mlkl^{-/-}$ mice. All reported lethality phenotypes of $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice and related necroptosis pathway mice are summarized in Supplementary information S1 (table).

**Necroptosis during bacterial infections.** Currently, *in vivo* data do not support an important role for necroptosis against bacterial infections. The most prominent report proposed that reduced necroptosis leads to increased susceptibility to S. Typhimurium infection in mice lacking $Ifnar1$ (which encodes interferon $\alpha / \beta$-receptor subunit 1) ${ }^{72}$. However, this study did not compare other competing hypotheses, most importantly, the hyper-responsiveness of $Ifnar1^{-/-}$ mice to IFN$\gamma$ (which combats intracellular bacteria such as S. Typhimurium) owing to increased expression of the IFN$\gamma$ receptor ${ }^{73}$. Wild-type mice and $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice showed similar susceptibility to S. Typhimurium infection ${ }^{72}$, demonstrating that necroptosis plays little role in IFNAR1-sufficient mice. Similarly, $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice and wild-type mice are comparably sensitive to Yersinia pseudotuberculosis ${ }^{74}$ and Citrobacter rodentium infections ${ }^{75}$. $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice may have a subtle (but statistically insignificant) susceptibility to an LPS-engineered Yersinia pestis strain that cannot evade TLR4 (REF. 76) (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). Interestingly, $Mlkl^{-/-}$ mice are susceptible to Staphylococcus aureus skin infection ${ }^{77}$, but $Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice are paradoxically resistant to both skin infection and lung infection ${ }^{77,78}$. Inhibitor treatment suggests that necroptosis may be pathological during Serratia marcescens infection ${ }^{79}$, but this needs further study using knockout mice. Specific inhibition of RIPK3 by bacteria has not yet been described. Many more bacterial infection models remain to be examined in $Ripk3^{-/-}$ and/or in $Mlkl^{-/-}$ mice, and it seems likely that some studies will establish a role for necroptosis in defence against specific bacteria.

granzymes, which activate apoptotic caspases. Upon completion of apoptosis, cellular contents are encapsulated within membrane-bound apoptotic bodies. If these bodies are not cleared, they will undergo secondary necrosis (rupture), releasing cytosolic damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) to the extracellular space ${ }^{80}$. The role of apoptosis against infection is perhaps best appreciated by inference, as numerous viruses and bacteria encode apoptosis inhibitors that are essential for virulence (reviewed in REFS 81,82). This also raises the conundrum: if most viruses evade apoptosis, do pathogens exist that apoptosis effectively counters, providing fully penetrant innate immunity (BOX 1)? We focus below on some of the recent advances in apoptosis research that are relevant to infection.

**Guarding cell intrinsic apoptosis with interferons.** Intrinsic apoptosis is often driven by cell intrinsic stresses, such as DNA damage and growth factor withdrawal, which leads to mitochondrial outer-membrane permeabilization (MOMP) ${ }^{83,84}$. Although its structure remains to be fully elucidated, the MOMP pore appears to be formed by BAX and BAK ${ }^{83,84}$. MOMP leads to the release of mitochondrial contents, including cytochrome $c$, into the cytosol where it binds to the NLR protein apoptotic protease activating factor 1 (APAF1), which oligomerizes into a hub to form the apoptosome — an activating platform for the initiator caspase 9. Activated caspase 9 in turn cleaves and activates the effector caspases caspase 3 and caspase 7 (REF. 2). As apoptosis destroys the replicative niche of intracellular pathogens, particularly viruses, those that prevent apoptosis will replicate better as the infected cell lives longer.

Historically, apoptosis is considered immunologically silent owing to the collective efforts of caspases. For example, apoptotic DAMPs that can induce a robust type I interferon-mediated pro-inflammatory response are dampened by caspases ${ }^{85,86}$. During viral infection of $Casp9^{-/-}$ or $Casp3^{-/-}Casp7^{-/-}$ cells, MOMP is initiated, but apoptosis fails to proceed. MOMP eventually releases mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) into the cytosol, where it is detected by the DNA sensor cGAS, resulting in a type I IFN response ${ }^{85,86}$. Thus, pathogens that only block caspases will encounter a cGAS-driven type I IFN response that effectively guards events downstream of MOMP. This interferon response promotes resistance to viral infections, including encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). By contrast, blockade upstream of MOMP — which can be studied in $Bax^{-/-}Bak^{-/-}$ mice — does not trigger cGAS because MOMP is not initiated and mitochondria retain their DNA ${ }^{85,86}$.

Apoptosis is a form of programmed cell death that is characterized by cytoplasmic shrinking, cell rounding, chromatin condensation, DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing ${ }^{1,2}$. Apoptosis can be initiated by cell extrinsic pathways (which are mediated by death receptors) and cell intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways, both of which culminate in the activation of the effector caspases 3, 6 and 7 (FIG. 2). Apoptosis can also be initiated by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) cells that deliver

**Apoptosis and necroptosis guard innate immune signalling.** Cell extrinsic apoptosis is typically initiated by extracellular stress signals that engage a subset of the tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily of receptors known as death receptors ${ }^{2}$. Prototypical extrinsic stimuli include FasL, TNF and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL). Following death receptor engagement, caspase 8 is recruited and activated via

Box 2 | Compound defects in Casp8⁻/⁻ mice

Investigators generated mice lacking caspase 8 to study cell extrinsic apoptosis in vivo, but these mice turned out not to be viable⁴. A caspase 8 deletion induces necroptosis and the destruction of the yolk sac vasculature, and this circulatory failure leads to embryonic death. However, the introduction of Ripk3⁻/⁻ complements the lethality, and Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice are viable as cells in these mice cannot undergo necroptosis⁸⁸,⁸⁹. Comparing Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice with Ripk3⁻/⁻ controls allows the study of caspase 8 genetic deficiency in vivo. However, these mice must be interpreted with great caution because the Casp8⁻/⁻ mutation eliminates multiple signalling pathways: first, it eliminates extrinsic apoptosis driven by tumour necrosis factor (TNF), Fas and TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL), which could be beneficial during infection⁸⁸,⁸⁹,¹⁶⁰; second, it alters homeostasis in adaptive immune cells, resulting in a lymphoproliferative disorder that is apparent at 2 months of age⁸⁸,⁸⁹; third, it substantially impedes or fully abrogates transcriptional responses via TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) and TLR4 owing to loss of the caspase 8–RIPK1 scaffolding platform⁹⁷,⁹⁸; fourth, its effect on TNF, TLR3 and TLR4 also prevents these receptors from post-translational priming of the NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome⁷⁵,⁷⁶,¹⁰⁰,¹⁰⁷–¹⁰⁹. Fadd⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice are similarly affected⁷¹,⁷⁴,⁷⁵,¹⁶¹. This makes it difficult to assign a precise caspase 8 function to phenotypes observed by comparing Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice with Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice. In order to do this, one could start by comparing various Ripk3⁻/⁻ background mice. For example, the resistance of Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice to endotoxic shock⁸⁸ may be similar to Tlr4⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice but not to Nlrp3⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice. This would begin to ascribe the mechanism to the effect of Casp8 deletion upon TLR4 signalling and not to its influence on NLRP3.

function, signalling build-up at RIPK1 results in the activation of RIPK3, triggering this second guard pathway that drives the response to infection to necroptosis rather than to apoptosis (FIG. 2). Thus, caspase 8, RIPK1 and RIPK3 essentially function as a triangular guard system.

This cross-guarded system becomes activated during embryogenesis in Casp8⁻/⁻ mice, causing embryonic lethality⁴. In line with the cross-guard model, Casp8⁻/⁻ lethality is rescued by simultaneous deletion of Ripk3 (REFS 88,89). Thus, caspase 8 is guarded by RIPK1–RIPK3-driven necroptosis.

Further, recent evidence suggests that RIPK3 is guarded by caspase 8, essentially reverse guarding the guard. Although Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice are viable and healthy, mice engineered to carry some (but not all) point mutations within the Ripk3 kinase enzymatic site suffer from neonatal lethality as a caspase 8 guard programme becomes activated, triggering lethal apoptosis during development⁹⁰,⁹¹. In this guard system, the RIPK3 protein must be present and abnormal in order to trigger caspase 8, whereas simple absence of RIPK3 does not trip this guard pathway (as it does when caspase 8 is absent). This could explain instances in which stimuli cause necroptosis, but Mlkl⁻/⁻ cells still die, whereas Ripk3⁻/⁻ cells live; in Mlkl⁻/⁻ cells, signalling events may accumulate at RIPK3, triggering the guard function of caspase 8, but this does not happen if Ripk3 is deleted⁵³.

Finally, RIPK1 is guarded by both caspase 8 and RIPK3. Deletion of Ripk1 can only be rescued by simultaneous deletion of both Casp8 and Ripk3 (REFS 92–94), illustrating redundant guarding. On the necroptosis side, there are two pathways that guard RIPK1. The first is direct, in which RIPK3 autonomously activates in response to deleted or abnormal RIPK1. The second is upstream: when RIPK1 is absent or its RHIM domain is mutated, this triggers activation of ZBP1, which normally docks on RIPK1 to hold ZBP1 in an inactive state⁹⁵,⁹⁶. Thus, Ripk1RHIM mice can be rescued by crossing with Mlkl⁻/⁻, Ripk3⁻/⁻ or Zbp1⁻/⁻ mice⁹⁵,⁹⁶. Once activated, ZBP1 activates RIPK3. Together, they essentially double guard RIPK1. To add to the complexity, the caspase 8 guard function is built into the RIPK1 scaffold function; TNFR1–TLR3–TLR4 signalling fails to drive transcription in Casp8⁻/⁻ cells⁹⁷,⁹⁸. It seems that RIPK1 fails to function when it is unable to interact with its guard caspase 8. The same may be true for Ripk3⁻/⁻ cells but only in specific cell types⁹⁹. By contrast, TLR2 signalling, which does not use TRIF–RIPK1, remains intact⁷⁶,¹⁰⁰ (although one study did see defects in TLR2 signalling⁷⁵, perhaps owing to autocrine TNF signalling (BOX 2; FIG. 2)).

One way to try to study cell extrinsic apoptosis in vivo is to compare Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice with Ripk3⁻/⁻ control mice. However, given the compound effects of deleting Casp8 (elaborated in BOX 2), it is not surprising that Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice are highly susceptible to multiple infectious challenges. Casp8⁻/⁻Ripk3⁻/⁻ mice have more rapid dissemination and/or lethality of fully virulent Y. pestis or Y. pseudotuberculosis⁷⁴,⁷⁶. These mice also have higher stool burdens during C. rodentium infection⁷⁵. Furthermore, they succumb to infections by Y. pestis strains engineered to enhance TLR4 detection⁷⁶, perhaps

the death inducing signalling complex (DISC). In certain cell types, caspase 8 can also cleave BID into tBID, initiating MOMP in a positive feedback loop that leads to the activation of caspase 9, another initiator caspase, thus ensuring a strong initiation of apoptosis. Therefore, caspase 8 activation connects extrinsic and intrinsic apoptosis (FIG. 2).

Additionally, caspase 8 is ensconced within the TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1), TLR3 and TLR4 signalling pathways³⁻⁵,⁸⁷. Caspase 8 interacts with RIPK1, which is a key scaffolding protein within the signalling cascade³⁻⁵,⁸⁷. Thus, caspase 8 is often interpreted as a node that regulates the divergence of signalling towards either transcriptional responses or apoptosis. For example, it is frequently stated that caspase 8 regulates TNF-dependent transcriptional responses and TNF-driven apoptosis³⁻⁵,⁸⁷. Below, we present this pathway from the perspective of a pathogen.

TNFR1, TLR3 and TLR4 are important innate immune sensors — which respond to TNF, double-stranded RNA and LPS, respectively — that drive potent transcriptional responses (but that do not trigger cell death under normal circumstances)³. Hence, these sensors are attractive targets for pathogens to inhibit, particularly as all three use RIPK1 as a scaffolding node to assemble signalling complexes (FIG. 2). However, when signalling at or downstream of RIPK1 is pharmacologically inhibited, this causes an alteration in the flow of signals through the pathway, which triggers a counter response that activates caspase 8 (REFS 3,5). In other words, if pathogens target these signalling pathways they would be met by a caspase 8 ‘tripwire’ that triggers apoptosis. If pathogens possessed virulence strategies to simultaneously target RIPK1 and caspase 8, they would encounter a second tripwire in RIPK3, which also interacts with RIPK1. As the first caspase 8 tripwire fails to

owing to defective TLR4 signalling. Defective TLR4  
signalling would also explain the resistance of $Casp8^{-/-}$  
background mice to endotoxic shock ${ }^{88}$. $Fadd^{-/-} Mklk^{-/-}$  
mice (which are similar to $Casp8^{-/-} Ripk3^{-/-}$ mice (see  
BOX 2)) have increased mortality due to influenza A virus  
infection ${ }^{64}$, perhaps owing to defects in TLR3 signalling.

In summary, multiple innate immune defence pathways intersect at the caspase 8–RIPK1–RIPK3 triangle. It seems likely that the intricate cross-wiring of these pathways has an important role in preventing pathogens from inhibiting the function of TLR3, TLR4, TNFR1, extrinsic apoptosis and necroptosis.

### Neutrophil NETosis makes NETs

Whereas necroptosis and apoptosis are seen in many cell types, another form of cell death is uniquely observed in neutrophils — NETosis, which primarily functions to extrude NETs ${ }^{101}$ (FIG. 3). NETosis is triggered either by various microbial and sterile activators — a process that has recently been shown to differentiate between micro-organisms based on their size ${ }^{102}$ — or by the ligation of specific receptors, including complement, antibodies, cytokines and TLRs ${ }^{103}$. During NETosis, ROS-dependent release of elastase and myeloperoxidase from neutrophil granules to the nucleus (although not under all conditions) ${ }^{104}$ promotes histone degradation and chromatin decondensation ${ }^{105}$. The effects of ROS and proteases on the nuclear material leads to the extrusion of a meshwork of chromatin fibres, dotted with granules that contain antimicrobial molecules, which traps and kills extracellular bacteria and fungi.

NETosis is accompanied by ruptures in the plasma membrane and neutrophil lysis ${ }^{101}$. However, a mounting body of evidence has demonstrated that neutrophils can release NETs while maintaining an intact plasma membrane ${ }^{103}$; this is paradoxically referred to as ‘vital NETosis’, in contrast to the typical ‘suicidal NETosis’. After vital NETosis, neutrophils continue to function in chemotaxis, phagocytosis and bacterial killing ${ }^{106}$.

Whether a neutrophil undergoes suicidal or vital  
NETosis seems to be dependent on the NET-inducing  
stimulus. It is unknown how NETs are extruded from  
neutrophils without lysing the cell.

Whether NETosis has antimicrobial functions that  
are independent of NET extrusion remains unknown,  
but one could imagine that pathogens within neutrophils  
during NETosis could be killed by the release of granule  
contents into the nucleus or cytosol (see REF. 7 for a comprehensive review on NET signalling mechanisms). How  
NETs combat infection is described further below in our  
discussion of the consequences of cell death.

#### Crosstalk between cell death pathways

There are many cross-pathway signalling events among apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis (FIG. 4). Most prominent among these are NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) interactions with the different cell death pathways. Although the precise signal detected by NLRP3 is uncertain, NLRP3 can be considered as the ‘sensor for cellular catastrophe’ (BOX 3) that is activated when normal cellular physiology breaks down.

#### Role of caspase 8 upstream of inflammasome signalling

Caspase 8 is a component of the TNFR1–TLR3–TLR4 signalling scaffold. Therefore, loss of caspase 8 prevents these receptors from providing both post-translational and transcriptional priming of inflammasome components. For example, pro-IL-1β and NLRP3 transcriptional induction is compromised in Casp8-deficient cells ${ }^{75,76,100,107-109}$, although this may not hold true for all cell types ${ }^{110}$. Furthermore, NLRP3 requires TNFR1 or TLR signalling to provide post-translational priming ${ }^{111-113}$. Thus, $Casp8^{-/-}$ cells fail to prime NLRP3 after TNFR1, TLR3 or TLR4 stimulation but can prime NLRP3 within 10 minutes of TLR2 stimulation ${ }^{76,100,108,114}$. However, when longer time points (4 hours) are examined, TLR2-driven TNF may require caspase 8 to cause paracrine stimulation ${ }^{75}$. By contrast, Casp8 deficiency does not prevent the

| Cell death programme | Apoptosis | Pyroptosis | Necroptosis | Necrosis | NETosis |

| Fate of cell corpse   | Efferocytosis | Efferocytosis | ? | Efferocytosis | ? |
| Secondary phagocyte   | Macrophage | Neutrophil | ? | Macrophage or neutrophil | ? |

**Figure 3 | Apoptotic bodies, neutrophil extracellular traps and pore-induced intracellular traps.** The fate of the cell corpse is dependent on the cell death pathway. Extrinsic apoptosis and intrinsic apoptosis lead to the formation of apoptotic bodies that are engulfed by a secondary phagocyte, a process that is referred to as efferocytosis. In the absence of efferocytosis, apoptotic bodies can undergo secondary necrosis. Lytic death of cells infected with an intracellular pathogen, including pyroptosis, leads to the formation of a pore-induced intracellular trap (PIT), which traps the pathogen within the cell corpse. The PIT also presents ligands that are recognized by neutrophils (and potentially macrophages), which efferocytose the PITs and associated bacteria, ultimately killing the pathogen. Efferocytosis of pathogen-containing apoptotic bodies also eliminates the pathogen. Necroptosis and necrosis also result in PITs *in vitro*, although the physiological importance *in vivo* needs further study. Following the detection of extracellular pathogens, neutrophils extrude a meshwork of chromatin dotted with granules loaded with antimicrobial molecules. These neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) trap and kill extracellular pathogens.

activation of inflammasomes that do not need priming, such as NLRC4 (REFS 75,107). The *in vivo* relevance of these interactions remains to be assessed.

**Caspase 8 downstream of inflammasomes ensures death.** Caspase 8 can also function downstream of inflammasomes, which makes caspase 8 interactions more complicated. Caspase 8 may guard pyroptosis, and thereby ensure the activation of cell death in a hypothetical situation in which a pathogen attempts to inhibit pyroptosis. ASC is a small adaptor protein between most inflammasomes and caspase 1; the ASC pyrin domain (PYD) interacts with the PYD of inflammasomes, and its caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) interacts with the CARD of caspase 1 (REF. 13). Upon activation by inflammasomes, ASC polymerizes to provide a large surface area of activating CARD domains<sup>115,116</sup>. In the absence of caspase 1, cell death still occurs after ASC polymerization, but under slower kinetics and with apoptotic morphology. In this case, caspase 8 is proposed to interact with ASC through an unusual heterotypic death domain fold interaction between the ASC CARD and the caspase 8 death effector domain<sup>117–119</sup> (FIG. 4). This pathway may be most relevant when a pathogen directly inhibits caspase 1 without preventing ASC polymerization<sup>120</sup>. This situation is mimicked by comparing *Asc*<sup>−/−</sup> mice with *Casp1*<sup>−/−</sup> mice, which reveals an *in vivo* effect of cytokine responses through this pathway during an *F. novicida* infection<sup>117,121</sup>, but this has no effect on the *F. novicida* bacterial load<sup>117,121</sup>.

In addition, caspase 8 may be directly activated by caspase 1 in settings in which gasdermin D is absent. Although cell death was fully ablated in *Gsdmd*<sup>−/−</sup> cells in one study<sup>21</sup>, a slower form of cell death was observed in another study<sup>22</sup> that was later suggested to be apoptosis that was associated with caspase 8 activation<sup>23</sup>. By contrast, this pathway to apoptosis was not observed after the activation of caspase 11 (REF. 22) (FIG. 4). Some researchers describe this pathway as the “suppression of apoptosis by pyroptosis” (REF. 23) or as a “balance between pyroptosis and apoptosis” that depends on the quantity of

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Figure 4 | Interactions among apoptotic, necroptotic and pyroptotic pathways. Cell death pathways can interact with each other, with the caveat that once a cell death pathway runs to completion, the interaction ends. The exception to this is the lysis of apoptotic bodies by secondary necrosis, which releases cytosolic contents, effectively converting apoptosis to lytic cell death. Signalling pathways running through RIPK1 will fail if Casp8 is deleted, affecting the priming of NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) and caspase 11 (REFS 75,76,100,107–109). Caspase 1-driven interleukin-18 (IL-18) can have two interactions with other pathways: first, by inducing interferon-γ (IFNγ) production to prime caspase 11 (REF. 19); and second, by stimulating natural killer (NK) cytotoxic activity<sup>39</sup>. The terminal events occurring after the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) or gasdermin D pores open are catastrophic, resulting in the loss of cellular potassium, which is the trigger for NLRP3 activation<sup>164,165</sup>. In the window between potassium loss and membrane rupture, NLRP3 activity will trigger caspase 1-dependent processing of IL-1β and IL-18 processing. Finally, ASC and caspase 1 can activate caspase 8, triggering apoptosis<sup>22,23,117,118</sup>. Grey arrows indicate interacting pathways. DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns; De-Ub, deubiquitylation; FADD, FAS-associated death domain; TNF, tumour necrosis factor.

agonist<sup>118</sup>. However, we prefer the interpretation that this is a versatile pathway that can switch from pyroptosis to apoptosis in the hypothetical case in which a pathogen inhibits pyroptosis, thus ensuring cell death<sup>117</sup>. Apoptosis could thus be considered as a backup guard pathway for pyroptosis, however, the *in vivo* relevance it may have in the control of pathogen burden remains to be elucidated.

Finally, caspase 8 has been proposed to substitute for caspase 1 as a pro-IL-1β and pro-IL-18 cleaving enzyme<sup>121–125</sup>, although this function warrants further study.

In summary, caspase 8 has been proposed to function upstream of inflammasomes, but also downstream of inflammasomes, which creates a fairly confusing picture when one attempts to integrate the multiple functions of caspase 8 into a single model. *In vivo* validation of these interactions will hopefully reveal their physiological importance.

**Caspase 1-driven IL-18 primes caspase 11.** Mouse caspase 11 activation is strictly dependent on priming; *in vitro*, this is commonly accomplished by studying cells that have previously been primed by type I IFNs (through TLR3- or TLR4-driven type I IFN secretion)<sup>6</sup> or by TLR2 stimulation<sup>16</sup>. The TLR3 pathway has been used *in vivo* to enable caspase 11 priming during LPS shock models<sup>15,16</sup>. Surprisingly, these pathways were insufficient to prime caspase 11 during infection with the cytosol-invasive bacterium *B. thailandensis in vivo*<sup>19</sup>. Instead, NLRC4-driven caspase 1 activation was required to drive IL-18 production, which in turn stimulated IFNγ within the first day of infection. IFNγ was absolutely essential for caspase 11 priming in this model, and endogenous TLR agonists and type I IFN were insufficient. The IL-18 requirement could be bypassed only under delayed kinetics after 3 days as alternative mediators eventually promoted IFNγ production<sup>19</sup>. Thus, in the context of intracellular bacterial infection *in vivo*, caspase 1 acts upstream of caspase 11 priming, which was surprising as NLRP3 and caspase 1 are commonly thought to function downstream of caspase 11 (BOX 3).

**IL-18 drives NK cytotoxicity versus intracellular bacteria.** NK-derived IFNγ has been well established to combat intracellular bacterial infection. However, whereas NK cytotoxicity is crucial for combating viruses such as MCMV, HSV-1 and influenza virus, as well as cancer, initial *in vitro* studies suggesting that bacterially infected cells are killed by NK cells have been uniformly disproved by subsequent *in vivo* studies<sup>126,127</sup>. Collectively, these data led to the conclusion that cytokines rather than cytotoxicity are the primary mode of NK cell-mediated protection against intracellular pathogens. However, our group recently showed that NK lysis of infected hepatocytes is crucial for controlling infection by an intracellular bacterial pathogen<sup>39</sup>. In this model, infected phagocytes detected *C. violaceum* via NLRC4, which led to the production of IL-18 and the activation of liver NK cells. Activated NK cells then directly lysed infected hepatocytes in a perforin-dependent manner. NK cytotoxicity also controlled the inflammasome-evasive *L. monocytogenes* infection, but only when mice were treated with exogenous IL-18 (REF. 39). This example highlights the importance of direct cytotoxicity against bacteria and crosstalk between two different cell death modalities — inflammasomes and apoptosis — to efficiently fight infection. Similarly, NK cytotoxicity that was initiated by inflammasome detection of S. Typhimurium in a colitis model was recently shown to promote inflammation<sup>128</sup>, and *Prfl<sup>-/-</sup>* mice were also susceptible to *C. rodentium* during the innate phase of infection<sup>129</sup>. Interestingly, human (but not mouse) NK cells have additional means to directly kill bacteria, as granulysin delivered on NK degranulation is directly toxic for both bacteria and parasites<sup>130,131</sup>.

**How programmed cell death clears infection**

Recent studies have examined the fate of pathogens after apoptosis, necroptosis and pyroptosis, and how these cell death mechanisms promote the resolution of infection. Apoptosis converts cells into apoptotic bodies, which release a series of find-me and eat-me signals that promote efferocytosis, which is the phagocytosis of dead cells. How the necrotic and pyroptotic cells are

---

**Box 3 | As the sensor of cellular catastrophe, NLRP3 detects the pyroptotic and necroptotic pores**

Although NLR family, pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) is the most extensively investigated inflammasome, it remains the most enigmatic. NLRP3 is activated in response to numerous insults, including pore-forming toxins, ionophores and phagocytosis of indigestible particulates. As such, NLRP3 detects catastrophic events, including the inability to maintain cytosolic potassium concentration<sup>162</sup> through an unknown biochemical mechanism. Besides loss of cytosolic potassium, other mechanisms have also been proposed to explain NLRP3 activation, including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress and mitochondrial dysfunction<sup>163</sup>.

NLRP3 is also activated downstream of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) detection by caspase 11 (REF. 14). When caspase 11 cleaves gasdermin D, it polymerizes into the pyroptotic pore. The resulting loss of cytosolic potassium triggers NLRP3 and consequent interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18 processing<sup>164,165</sup> (FIG. 3). Thus, NLRP3 has a very short activation window before cellular swelling causes the rupture of the plasma membrane. IL-1β secretion downstream of cytosolic LPS is thus much lower than other direct inflammasome agonists. Currently, there is no *in vivo* evidence supporting the physiological relevance of NLRP3 activation downstream of caspase 11. In fact, caspase 11-dependent defence against *Burkholderia thailandensis* does not require NLRP3 (REF. 19), which argues against an *in vivo* role, at least in this model system.

Similarly, NLRP3 activation downstream of necroptosis<sup>53,100,110</sup> may be caused by the same mechanism. It is likely that potassium loss after opening of the mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) pore is detected by NLRP3. This pathway may promote IL-1β secretion *in vivo* during influenza virus and vesicular stomatitis virus infection<sup>166</sup>, but more work is needed to determine whether MLKL is the primary pathway through which NLRP3 is activated *in vivo*, or whether NLRP3 is actually responding to some other catastrophic event during infection *in vivo*.
cleared is currently under thorough investigation. These mechanisms remove the niche for intracellular viruses and bacteria, but pathogens frequently survive host cell death. Finally, NETosis generates structures that are specifically microbicidal. We discuss below what happens to pathogens after programmed cell death (FIG. 3).

**Efferocytosis of apoptotic bodies.** The resolution phase of apoptosis is another example of how apoptotic caspases maintain immunological silence. Failure to clear apoptotic debris can contribute to inflammatory disease or autoimmune disease<sup>80</sup>. During normal development and homeostasis, apoptotic bodies are efferocytosed by a secondary phagocyte, thereby preventing secondary necrosis and maintaining immunological quiescence<sup>80</sup>. Efferocytosis is currently an active area of research in the context of infection.

Until recently, apoptosis was often considered intrinsically bactericidal. For example, apoptosis was thought to kill *Mycobacterium* spp. *in vitro*<sup>132</sup> and *in vivo*<sup>133</sup>. However, recent studies have suggested that *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* and *Mycobacterium marinum* survive apoptosis but are subsequently killed after efferocytosis by a secondary macrophage<sup>134,135</sup>. This efferocytic phagosome matures, acidifies and kills the bacteria using ROS. Notably, pathogens that resist apoptosis, such as *Mycobacterium* spp., also interfere with efferocytosis, which increases their survival<sup>136</sup>. *L. monocytogenes*, conversely, exploits efferocytosis receptors in order to spread from cell to cell<sup>137</sup>. The Listeriolysin O toxin damages the plasma membrane, exposing phosphatidyl serine, which is recognized by TIM4. As *L. monocytogenes* propels itself with actin comets, TIM4 on the neighbouring cell promotes efferocytosis of the protruding membrane, enabling *L. monocytogenes* to enter the next cell<sup>137</sup>.

Virus-containing apoptotic bodies can also be efferocytosed; for example, influenza A virus induces the apoptosis of infected epithelial cells, and neighbouring macrophages efferocytose apoptotic bodies that contain viral progeny, which reduces viral titres<sup>138</sup>. However, some viruses use mimicry to induce apoptosis in order to spread to neighbouring cells<sup>139</sup>.

**NETs trap extracellular microorganisms.** In addition to killing pathogens after phagocytosis, neutrophils can target extracellular pathogens using NETs<sup>101</sup>. NETs have two distinct antimicrobial roles by trapping and killing pathogens. Extensive intravital and confocal microscopy of neutrophils in infected tissue show in real time how bacterial and fungal pathogens can be trapped in NETs<sup>103,105,140</sup>. Moreover, additional pathogens are trapped in the extracellular chromatin *in vitro*. In fact, systemic DNase treatment in a mouse model of an *S. aureus* skin infection, which induces NET formation, resulted in the escape of the bacteria from the site of inoculation and increased vascular bacterial loads<sup>106</sup>.

The extent to which NETs are directly capable of killing bacterial and fungal pathogens remains controversial, as not all bacterial pathogens trapped in NETs are killed and there are no known specific inhibitors that unlink NET release from NET antimicrobial activity. For example, *in vitro* DNase treatment of *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Candida albicans* trapped in NETs results in the release of viable bacteria<sup>141</sup>. This lack of microbial killing may stem from the loss of optimal protease activity of key bactericidal enzymes, such as elastase, under *in vitro* conditions<sup>142</sup>. Moreover, many research groups have clearly demonstrated antimicrobial activity of NETs against a variety of microorganisms *in vitro*<sup>140</sup>, and trapping is obviously beneficial to the host<sup>103,143</sup>. For example, intravital microscopy of *Escherichia coli* trapped in NETs within liver sinusoids demonstrated that the disruption of NETs via platelet depletion or DNase treatment prevents trapping and promotes dissemination<sup>143</sup>. The use of vital DNA-intercalating dyes demonstrated that bacteria trapped within NETs are killed<sup>101,144</sup>. A thorough discussion of the controversies regarding the composition and antimicrobial properties of NETs was recently published<sup>145</sup>.

Many pathogens directly disrupt NETs — such as group B *Streptococcus*<sup>146</sup>, *Vibrio cholerae*<sup>147</sup>, *Yersinia enterocolitica*<sup>148</sup> and *Neisseria gonorrhoeae*<sup>149</sup> — by expressing nucleases that degrade the NET-associated chromatin, which enables them to escape from NETs and may result in systemic dissemination and sepsis. Other pathogens, such as *Haemophilus influenzae*<sup>150</sup>, *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*<sup>151</sup> and *S. pneumoniae*<sup>152</sup>, evade NETs by incorporating NET-associated DNA into their biofilms, which promotes their replication *in vivo*. Hence, the trapping of some microorganisms by NETs in the absence of bacterial killing could be advantageous to the pathogen. Finally, some pathogens evade killing through NETs by sidestepping the specific antimicrobial activity of NET components by expressing polysaccharide capsules<sup>153,154</sup>. A full overview of exotoxins that disrupt NETs and other evasion mechanisms is provided elsewhere<sup>155</sup>.

**Pore-induced intracellular traps.** Recent evidence from our group establishes the fate of the pyroptotic cell corpse and its role in coordinating a downstream innate immune response. Similar to apoptosis, pyroptosis does not kill bacteria<sup>9,40</sup>. We initially assumed that pyroptosis released intracellular bacteria to the extracellular space<sup>9</sup>. However, in a follow-up study we show that viable bacteria remain trapped within the cellular debris of pyroptotic macrophages<sup>40</sup>. This trapping seems to be mediated by the pyroptotic cell membrane, which remains mostly intact despite containing discrete ruptures, encompassing collapsed organelles and cellular structures. We call this structure the pore-induced intracellular trap (PIT)<sup>35,40</sup> (FIG. 3), which is conceptually parallel to NETs. Both PITs and NETs trap the pathogen and prevent microbial dissemination. In contrast to NETs, which act against extracellular microorganisms, PITs trap intracellular microorganisms. In addition to pyroptosis, necroptosis and necrosis also result in the formation of a PIT that is efferocytosed by neutrophils and macrophages<sup>40</sup>, although the *in vivo* relevance of necroptotic and necrotic PITs in the context of infection remains to be elucidated.

PITs coordinate innate immune responses to combat intracellular bacteria; PIT formation leads to complement activation, the release of IL-1β and IL-18, and eicosanoid
production. These mediators recruit neutrophils, which use phagocytic scavenger and complement receptors to efferocytose the PIT and entrapped bacteria^{35,40}, which is conceptually parallel to the efferocytosis of bacteria trapped within apoptotic bodies^{134}. Ultimately, this secondary phagocyte kills the bacteria via ROS^{40}.

Therefore, we propose that PITs are highly effective, immunologically important structures with two key functions; PITs immobilize the pathogen to prevent dissemination and to promote efferocytosis by a secondary phagocyte that kills the pathogen.

**Concluding remarks**

Much work remains to be done to fully understand how pyroptosis, necroptosis, apoptosis and NETosis defend against infection *in vivo*. Genetic tools to study programmed cell death *in vivo* remain confounded by effects on other aspects of host defence. For example, Gsdmd deletion prevents pyroptosis but also prevents IL-1β and IL-18 secretion; similarly, Casp8 deletion prevents cell

32. Chen, X. *et al.* Pyroptosis is driven by non-selective gasdermin-D pore and its morphology is different from extrinsic apoptosis, but may also trigger necroptosis, cause a lymphoproliferative disorder and inhibit innate immune receptor signalling (BOX 2). Despite such difficulties, our understanding of programmed cell death has advanced considerably in recent years, revealing the utility of programmed cell death during infection both to destroy intracellular niches, and to coordinate an appropriate innate immune response thereafter. Finally, if a programmed cell death modality is exquisitely effective against a specific virulence strategy, this exerts strong selective pressure for those pathogens to evade the response. Therefore, when interpreting the results of experimental infections it is important to keep in mind the competing possibilities that the host may be benefiting, the pathogen may be evading, or host defence and pathogenic evasion may both be partially effective. In this regard, the identification of new infectious agents that fail to evade specific cell death pathways can aid our understanding of the true function of programmed cell death during infection.
