## Summary

Linker or adapter proteins provide mechanisms by which receptors can amplify and regulate downstream effector proteins. We describe here the identification of a novel B cell linker protein, termed BLNK, that interfaces the B cell receptor-associated Syk tyrosine kinase with PLCγ, the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor, and the Grb2 and Nck adapter proteins. Tyrosine phosphorylation of BLNK by Syk provides docking sites for these SH2-containing effector molecules that, in turn, permits the phosphorylation and/or activation of their respective signaling pathways. Hence, BLNK represents a central linker protein that bridges the B cell receptor-associated kinases with a multitude of signaling pathways and may regulate the biologic outcomes of B cell function and development.

## Introduction

Lymphocyte activation initiates a program of biochemical events involving a variety of distinct signaling pathways that culminate in gene transcription, clonal expansion, and cellular differentiation (reviewed in DeFranco, 1997; Kurosaki and Kurosaki, 1997; Reth and Wienands, 1997). The B cell antigen receptor utilizes receptor-encoded signaling motifs termed ITAMs (for immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs) to activate non-receptor tyrosine kinases. Sequential activation of at least three families of kinases—the Src-family of PTKs (including Fyn, Lyn, and Blk), Syk, and Btk—are required for phosphorylation of multiple cellular proteins to regulate downstream signaling pathways. Deficiencies in any of these three families of PTKs result in defective or aberrant B cell function and development. Hence, these B cell receptor (BCR)-associated PTKs are requisite for regulation of signaling pathways to generate second messengers upon BCR activation.

Multiple downstream signaling pathways activated through the BCR are required for normal B cell function (reviewed in DeFranco, 1997). Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 and γ2 hydrolyzes PIP₂ to IP₃ and diacylglycerol, which results in increases in free cytoplasmic calcium ([Ca²⁺]i) and activation of protein kinase C, respectively. Increases in [Ca²⁺]i regulate multiple calcium-dependent enzymes, including the serine/threonine phosphatase calcineurin, to dephosphorylate NF-AT, which results in its translocation from the cytoplasm to the nucleus (reviewed in Rao et al., 1997). Involvement of small G proteins, including both Ras and Rho family GTPases, also play critical roles in B cell activation. Ras activation is mediated through the translocation of the Son of Sevenless (SoS) exchange factor to membrane-bound Ras, which results in activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway (reviewed in Schlessinger, 1994). Membrane localization of SoS is mediated through the translocation of adapter protein complexes. In addition to Ras, recent studies also demonstrate the importance of Rho-GTPases. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor, which results in up-regulation of its exchange factor activity, has been proposed to regulate the subsequent activation of JNK and the p38 MAPK pathways (Bustelo and Barbacid, 1992; Crespo et al., 1996; Crespo et al., 1997; Teramoto et al., 1997). While these downstream signaling pathways are mediated through distinct signaling effector proteins, the coordinate activation of these pathways is required for normal B cell function (Healy et al., 1997). Absence of NF-κB and JNK activation in the presence of normal MAPK and NF-AT signaling is associated with B cell tolerance.

While much has been learned as to how calcium, Ras, and Rho-GTPases may regulate their downstream targets, the mechanisms by which the BCR-associated PTKs regulate PLCγ, Grb2, and Vav remain unclear. While Syk can phosphorylate PLCγ in vitro (Law et al., 1996), expression of a functional BCR, Fyn, and Syk in nonlymphoid cells does not induce PLCγ phosphorylation or increased [Ca²⁺]i (Richards et al., 1996). These reconstitution studies suggest the existence of hematopoietic cell-specific proteins that may link Syk with PLCγ activation. We have previously identified two tyrosine phosphoproteins, pp70 and pp68, that associate with Grb2, Vav, and PLCγ following BCR activation and that may represent potential linker proteins to interface the BCR-associated PTKs with downstream effector signaling molecules (Fu and Chan, 1997). Here we describe the molecular and functional characterization of these two proteins, which we have termed BLNK for B-cell linker proteins.

Figure 1. Characterization of BLNK

(A) Biochemical and molecular characterization of BLNK. Top, Comassie blue staining of the purified proteins is shown on the left. The deduced amino acid sequence of human (top) and murine (bottom) BLNK is shown on the right. The seven peptide sequences obtained from protein sequencing are underlined. The 23 amino acids not present in the alternatively spliced form of human BLNK-s (amino acids 203–225) are denoted by the boxed sequence. Bottom, schematic diagrams of hBLNK, hBLNK-s, and hSLP-76. The 470 bp PCR probe is depicted at the top. The percentage of amino acid identity of the various domains between BLNK and SLP-76 is shown.

(B) BLNK mRNA is predominantly expressed in the spleen. Human multi-tissue Northern blots (Clontech) were hybridized with BLNK (top) or β-actin (bottom) cDNA probes.

(C) BLNK proteins are expressed only in B cell lines. Total cell lysates from different cell lines were immunoblotted with an anti-BLNK antiserum (top) or an anti-β-actin MAb (bottom). Ramos, Daudi, and Raji are human Burkitt lymphoma cells; WEHI-231, A20, and 70Z/3 are mouse B cells; Jurkat and EL4 are transformed T cell lines; K562 is a human erythroleukemia line; Thp-1 is a human monocytic cell line; RBL-1 is a rat basophil leukemia cell line; and LAK represents lymphokine-activated killer cells.

Grb2, PLCγ, and Vav following BCR activation (Fu and Chan, 1997). These two phosphoproteins were purified from 5 × 10^10^ BCR-activated human Ramos B cells using a two-step affinity purification protocol based on their ability to bind the C-terminal SH2 domain of PLCγ1 and an anti-phosphotyrosine (PTyr) MAb. Seven internal peptides, obtained from microsequencing of pp70 and pp68, were obtained, and the sequences KKPTTPLK and KRVYNIPVRFIEATK were used to generate degenerate oligonucleotides (sense, TCGAGAATTCAAA/AAA/GCCJACA/G/T/CACA/G/T/CCC; antisense, TCGAGGAT CCACIGGA/G/TATA/GTTA/GTAA/G/T/CAC). A 470 bp PCR product was obtained and used to isolate a 1.6 kb cDNA fragment from a λyes library constructed from EBV-transformed human B cells (Figure 1A). It contained an open reading frame that encodes a 456 amino acid polypeptide. The presence of a stop codon upstream of the first ATG and the presence of a Kozak sequence indicated that this represented a full-length cDNA. Expression of this cDNA in HeLa cells resulted in a protein that comigrated with pp70 (data not shown). Since pp70 interacts with a variety of signaling effector proteins in B cells, we have termed pp70 as BLNK for B-cell linker protein.

Since the seven peptides derived from both pp70 and pp68 were all present in the open reading frame, we reasoned that pp68 may arise from alternative splicing of the BLNK gene transcript. Analysis of RT-PCR products from human B cell mRNA demonstrated the existence of a shorter form of BLNK that lacked base pairs 760–828 of the human BLNK (hBLNK) cDNA. Expression of this shortened form of the hBLNK cDNA (designated as hBLNK-s) gave rise to a protein that comigrated with pp68 (data not shown). Hence, pp70 and pp68 represent alternatively spliced forms of the hBLNK gene.

A mouse cDNA clone was isolated from a λact mouse pre-B cell library using the human cDNA as a probe. This clone encoded a 457-amino acid polypeptide and shares 82% identity to the predicted human BLNK sequence (Figure 1A). In contrast to hBLNK, alternative splicing of the mBLNK gene transcript was not detected (data not shown). BLNK demonstrated its greatest homology with the SLP-76 linker protein, though the degree of homology was only ~33% (Jackman et al., 1995).

Regulation of B Cell Receptor Signal Transduction

Analysis of BLNK mRNA expression demonstrated its highest levels of expression in the spleen, with lower levels of expression in the liver, kidney, pancreas, small intestines, and colon (Figure 1B). Analysis of BLNK protein expression in hematopoietic and fibroblast cell lines from human, mouse, or rat origin demonstrated their preferential expression in human and mouse B cells (Figure 1C). While all human B cells examined expressed both BLNK and BLNK-s, mouse B cells expressed only one detectable form of the BLNK protein. Protein expression was not detected in a variety of T cell lines or other hematopoietic- and nonhematopoietic-derived cell lines (Figure 1C; data not shown). Hence, BLNK protein expression among hematopoietic cells appears limited to the B cell lineage, with human B cells expressing two alternatively spliced forms and mouse B cells expressing a single form.

### Tyrosine Phosphorylation of BLNK by Syk

The generation of anti-BLNK antibodies permitted us to analyze the phosphorylation status of BLNK and BLNK-s in resting and activated cells. Immunoprecipitation of BLNK and BLNK-s from resting and BCR-activated human Daudi B cells demonstrated that BLNK and BLNK-s undergo receptor-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation that peaks at 2 min following BCR activation and returns to near basal levels by 30 min (Figure 2A, lanes 1–7). No differences in the kinetics of phosphorylation or dephosphorylation were detected between BLNK and BLNK-s. Similarly, mBLNK was phosphorylated in a receptor-dependent fashion peaking at 10 min following BCR cross-linking, though tyrosine phosphorylation was maintained even up to 60 min following BCR activation (Figure 2A, lanes 8–15).

To identify the PTKs responsible for BLNK phosphorylation, we analyzed BLNK phosphorylation when expressed in a cohort of chicken B cell lines lacking Lyn, Syk, or Btk (Figure 2B) (Takata and Kurosaki, 1996; Takata et al., 1994). While expression of hBLNK in parental DT40 cells demonstrated its tyrosine phosphorylation following BCR cross-linking (lanes 1–2), tyrosine phosphorylation of hBLNK was attenuated in Lyn⁻ cells (lanes 3–4) and was abrogated in Syk⁻ cells (lanes 5–6). In contrast, BLNK was phosphorylated to a similar level in Btk⁻ cells (lanes 7–8). The attenuation of BLNK phosphorylation in Lyn⁻ cells suggested that either Lyn contributed to BLNK phosphorylation or merely reflected the upstream requirement of Lyn in Syk activation, which, in turn, is responsible for BLNK phosphorylation (Chan et al., 1994; Kurosaki et al., 1994; El-Hillal et al., 1997).

To distinguish between these possibilities, we analyzed the ability of BLNK to be phosphorylated by each PTK in insect cells. While coexpression of Syk and BLNK resulted in BLNK phosphorylation (Figure 2C, top panel, lane 2), coexpression of BLNK with either Lyn or Btk did not phosphorylate BLNK (lanes 3–4) despite higher levels of expression of Lyn and Btk compared to Syk (Figure 2C, bottom panel). Coexpression of Lyn with Btk, which also results in Btk activation, failed to result in significant BLNK phosphorylation (data not shown). Together, these studies indicate that Syk is responsible for BLNK phosphorylation.

BLNK interacts with PLCγ, Vav, Grb2, and Nck

Since pp70 and pp68 interact with PLCγ, Vav, and Grb2 (Fu and Chan, 1997), and since we have recently demonstrated that SLP-76 interacts with Nck following TCR activation (J. B. W. and A. C. C., unpublished data), we addressed the possibility that BLNK may serve as a linker protein to bridge Syk with downstream effector signaling molecules. Immunoprecipitates of an epitope-tagged form of BLNK were examined for association with PLCγ1, Vav, Grb2, or Nck from resting or BCR-activated Daudi cells (Figure 3A, lanes 1–8). Conversely, PLCγ1, Vav, Grb2, or Nck were immunoprecipitated and analyzed for their ability to interact with Myc-BLNK (Figure 3A, lanes 9–16). The association of BLNK with PLCγ1, Vav, or Nck was readily detected following BCR activation, though a low level of association of BLNK was detected with PLCγ1, Vav, and Nck in resting cells with substantially longer exposures of the film (data not shown). These data are consistent with our in vitro mapping studies demonstrating the requirements for the SH2 domains of PLCγ1, Vav, and Nck in this interaction (Fu and Chan, 1997; data not shown). In contrast, association of BLNK with Grb2 was readily observed in resting cells (Figure 3A, top panels, lanes 5 and 13) and was augmented following BCR activation (Figure 3A, top panels, lanes 6 and 14). These studies were similarly consistent with our in vitro mapping studies demonstrating the involvement of both SH3 and SH2 domains within Grb2 in its interaction with tyrosine phosphorylated BLNK and BLNK-s (Fu and Chan, 1997).

To ensure that these interactions were not the result of overexpression, we also analyzed the ability of endogenous BLNK and BLNK-s to interact with PLCγ1, Vav, Grb2, and Nck in resting and activated Daudi B cells (Figure 3B). Similar to Myc-BLNK, both BLNK and BLNK-s associated with PLCγ1, Vav, and Nck in a receptor-dependent fashion. In addition, BLNK and BLNK-s associated with Grb2 in resting cells, and its stoichiometry of association was increased following BCR cross-linking (Figure 3B, lanes 5–6). Hence, the association of BLNK with these four effector proteins in B cells supported the notion that BLNK may serve as a central protein to link the BCR-associated PTKs with downstream signaling functions.

### Interaction of Grb2 with BLNK

Since BLNK associated with Grb2, which, in turn, interacts with the SoS guanine nucleotide exchange factor, we analyzed the assembly of potential BLNK/Grb2/SoS complexes. Consistent with the basal association of BLNK with Grb2, SoS also coimmunoprecipitated with Myc-BLNK in resting cells (Figure 4A, top and middle panels, lane 1), an interaction that is likely to be mediated through Grb2. As the stoichiometry of association between Grb2 and BLNK increased following BCR cross-linking (middle panel), the association of SoS in BLNK immunoprecipitates also increased with BCR activation (top panel, lanes 1–2). Hence, the assembly of a BLNK/Grb2/SoS complex provides a mechanism by which BLNK may regulate the Ras signaling pathway.

Since translocation of the Grb2/SoS complex to the

Figure 2. Tyrosine Phosphorylation of BLNK by Syk

(A) Kinetics of BLNK tyrosine phosphorylation in Daudi cells and mouse B cells. Daudi cells (lanes 1–7) or mouse splenocytes (lanes 8–15) were stimulated for the indicated times with an anti-human IgM F(ab')₂ fragment or an anti-mouse IgM F(ab')₂ fragment, respectively. BLNK was then immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies.

(B) BLNK tyrosine phosphorylation is affected in Lyn⁻ and in Syk⁻ DT40 cells. Myc-hBLNK was transfected into DT40 cells (lanes 1–2) or its derivative Lyn⁻ (lanes 3–4), Syk⁻ (lanes 5–6), or Btk⁻ (lanes 7–8) cells. Following transfection, the cells were either left unstimulated (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7) or stimulated with an anti-chicken IgM MAb (M4; lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8). Myc-hBLNK was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

(C) Syk phosphorylates BLNK in insect cells. Myc-hBLNK was expressed in Sf9 cells either alone (lane 1) or coexpressed with GST-Syk (lane 2), GST-Lyn (lane 3), or GST-Btk (lane 4). BLNK was immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. Expression levels of the kinases were confirmed by immunoblotting with an anti-GST MAb (bottom panel).

membrane is important in its codistribution with membrane-localized Ras (reviewed in Schlessinger, 1994), we analyzed the cellular localization of BLNK in resting and activated cells. BCR activation resulted in the translocation of both BLNK and Grb2 to the membrane fraction (Figure 4B, top two panels, lanes 4–5). Treatment of cells with pervanadate, a tyrosine phosphatase inhibitor that mimics receptor activation (Secrist et al., 1993), resulted in a further increase in the translocation of both BLNK and Grb2 in the membrane fraction (Figure 4B, top two panels, lane 6). Hence, BCR activation results in the colocalization of BLNK/Grb2/SoS complexes to the membrane fraction.

As the Shc adapter protein, which can associate with the BCR complex and Syk, interacts with Grb2 following BCR activation and regulates Ras activation (Harwood and Cambier, 1993; Saxton et al., 1994; Smit et al., 1994; Nagai et al., 1995; D'Ambrosio et al., 1996; Harmer and DeFranco, 1997), we examined whether the BLNK/Grb2/SoS complex could coprecipitate with Shc. Shc was immunoprecipitated from resting or activated B cells and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-BLNK, anti-Shc, or anti-Grb2 antibodies (Figure 4C, lanes 1–2). While Shc associates with Grb2 only following BCR cross-linking (Figure 4C, bottom panel, lanes 1–2), BLNK was not detected in Shc immunoprecipitates (Figure 4C,

top panel, lanes 1–2). Conversely, while Grb2 associates with BLNK (Figure 4C, bottom panel, lanes 3–4), Shc was not detected in BLNK immunoprecipitates (Figure 4C, middle panel, lanes 3–4). Hence, BLNK/Grb2 complexes may represent a Shc-independent mechanism in regulating the Grb2/SoS signaling pathway.

Regulation of PLCγ Function by BLNK

To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which tyrosine phosphorylation of BLNK may regulate B cell activation, we generated stable B cell clones that overexpress a Myc epitope-tagged version of wild-type BLNK [designated as BLNK(WT)] or express a Myc epitope-tagged mutant version of BLNK [designated as BLNK(4F)] in which Tyr-72, -84, -96, and -178 were mutated to Phe. These four tyrosine residues were chosen because they have a similar motif to the three homologous tyrosine residues that are phosphorylated on SLP-76 (Bubeck-Wardenburg et al., 1996; Fang et al., 1996; Raab et al., 1997). All clones examined expressed comparable levels of surface BCR (data not shown). Both epitope-tagged versions of BLNK were expressed at 3- to 5-fold over endogenous BLNK (Figure 5A, bottom panel). Similar to endogenous BLNK, Myc-BLNK(WT) was phosphorylated following BCR activation (Figure 5A, top panel, lanes 1–4). In contrast, phosphorylation

(A) Interaction of Myc-BLNK with PLCγ, Vav, Grb2, and Nck. Myc-BLNK(WT) was expressed in Daudi cells and immunoprecipitated from lysates of resting (−) or BCR-activated cells (+). Anti-Myc immunoprecipitates were analyzed by immunoblotting with the indicated antibodies. The bottom panel demonstrates comparable levels of Myc-BLNK(WT) in all immunoprecipitates. Conversely, immunoprecipitates with anti-PLCγ1 (lanes 9–10), anti-Vav (lanes 11–12), anti-Grb2 (lanes 13–14), or anti-Nck (lanes 15–16) antiserum were immunoblotted with an anti-Myc MAb (top panel). The bottom panel demonstrates comparable levels of PLCγ1, Vav, Grb2, or Nck in each immunoprecipitate. IgL, light chain of the immunoprecipitating Ab.

(B) Interactions of BLNK and BLNK-s with PLCγ, Vav, Grb2, and Nck. PLCγ1 (lanes 1–2), Vav (lanes 3–4), Grb2 (lanes 5–6), or Nck (lanes 7–8) were immunoprecipitated from resting (−) or BCR-activated Daudi cells (+) and immunoblotted with an anti-BLNK MAb (top panel). The bottom panel demonstrates comparable levels of PLCγ1, Vav, Grb2, and Nck present in resting or BCR-activated conditions.

of Myc-BLNK(4F) was significantly reduced when compared to wild-type BLNK (Figure 5A, lanes 2 and 6). In addition, tyrosine phosphorylation of endogenous BLNK was reduced in cells expressing BLNK(4F).

To determine the functional role of BLNK, we assessed the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ in cells that overexpressed BLNK(WT) or expressed BLNK(4F). Tyrosine phosphorylation of both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2 was augmented in cells overexpressing BLNK(WT) as compared to parental cells (Figure 5B, top panel, lanes 1–4). Conversely, tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1/γ2 was decreased in cells expressing BLNK(4F) (Figure 5B, lanes 3–6). In addition, while both endogenous and Myc-BLNK(WT) associated with PLCγ1/γ2 following BCR activation, the association of Myc-BLNK(4F) with PLCγ1/γ2 was diminished (Figure 5B, middle panel, lanes 1–6). To ensure that the effect on PLCγ1/γ2 phosphorylation was specific to BLNK-regulated proteins and did not reflect a mere global decrease in the phosphorylation of cellular proteins, we examined the tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc. In contrast to the effects on PLCγ1/γ2 phosphorylation, tyrosine phosphorylation of Shc was not affected by BLNK (Figure 5B, lanes 7–12).

The changes in PLCγ1/γ2 phosphorylation, which mediate their enzymatic activities, were also reflected in alterations in the ability of the BCR to regulate [Ca²⁺]i. Overexpression of BLNK(WT) in two representative clones (WT1 and WT16) resulted in an ~50% increase in [Ca²⁺]i as compared to control cells (Figure 6A, left column). Conversely, expression of BLNK(4F) in representative clones (4F31 and 4F49) resulted in a 50% –67% decrease in BCR-mediated [Ca²⁺]i as compared to control cells (Figure 6A, right column). Addition of EGTA retained the differences observed in [Ca²⁺]i in cells overexpressing BLNK(WT) or cells expressing BLNK(4F) (data not shown). Hence, the observed differences in [Ca²⁺]i following BCR stimulation are derived, in part, through intracellular stores and likely reflect differences in the enzymatic activation of PLCγ1 and PLCγ2.

To further investigate the mechanism(s) by which BLNK may regulate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1, we tested whether BLNK could directly facilitate tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by Syk. Tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by Syk was analyzed in insect cells in the absence or presence of BLNK. While coexpression of PLCγ1 and Syk resulted in a low level of PLCγ1 phosphorylation (Figure 5C, top panel, lane 2), the coexpression of PLCγ1, BLNK, and Syk augmented PLCγ1 phosphorylation (Figure 5C, lane 3). Together, these studies suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of BLNK provides

(B) BLNK is translocated into the membrane fraction following BCR stimulation. Cytosolic and membrane fractions were prepared from resting (-), BCR stimulated (+), or pervanadate stimulated (PV) cells as described in Experimental Procedures. Top panel, BLNK was immunoprecipitated from cytosolic (lanes 1–3) or membrane (lanes 4–6) fractions and analyzed by immunoblotting. Four times as many cells were used in the membrane fractions. Bottom three panels, cytosolic and membrane fractions were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Equal numbers of cells were used in each fraction. Analysis of the nonmembrane localized c-Jun kinase 1 (JNK1) and the transmembrane protein CD45 (bottom two panels) confirmed the integrity of the cytosol and membrane fractions, respectively.

(C) BLNK/Grb2 complexes are independent of Shc/Grb2 complexes. Shc (lanes 1–2), BLNK (lanes 3–4), or Grb2 (lanes 5–6) were immunoprecipitated from resting (-) or BCR-activated Daudi B cells (+) and immunoblotted for BLNK (top), Shc (middle), and Grb2 (bottom).

a scaffolding to recruit and bind PLCγ1 and, in turn, facilitate the tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ1 by the Syk PTK.

As transcriptional activation of the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT) plays an important role in BCR-mediated proliferation (Ranger et al., 1998; Yoshida et al., 1998), we measured the ability of BLNK to regulate the transcriptional activation of NF-AT-responsive elements. In these experiments, mouse A20 B cells were used, since they exhibited substantially higher transfection efficiencies than Daudi B cells (data not shown). Transient overexpression of Myc-BLNK(WT) resulted in up to a 2.7-fold increase in NF-AT transcriptional activity as compared to vector control transfected cells (Figure 6B). The mean level of overexpression of Myc-BLNK(WT) achieved in these cells was substantially less than the endogenous BLNK (Figure 6B, right panel). Transfection of up to 60 μg of myc-BLNK(WT) cDNA, which resulted in an ~3-fold overexpression of Myc-BLNK(WT) as compared to endogenous BLNK, did not result in any additional increase in NF-AT transcriptional activity (data not shown). Conversely, expression of BLNK(4F) resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in NF-AT activity as compared to vector control transfected cells (Figure 6C). Transfection of increasing amounts of myc-BLNK(4F)

resulted in up to 70% inhibition of NF-AT activity. The mean level of expression of Myc-BLNK(4F) in these experiments ranged up to ~2.5-fold as compared to endogenous BLNK (Figure 6C, right panel). Hence, the requirement for tyrosine phosphorylation of BLNK by Syk in regulating PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation, increases in [Ca²⁺]i, and NF-AT transcriptional activity suggests that BLNK likely plays an important role in regulating PLC-mediated signaling pathways activated by the BCR.

Discussion

The current paradigm for growth factor receptor signaling involves receptor dimerization, activation of the receptor-encoded tyrosine kinases, phosphorylation of tyrosine residues within their cytoplasmic domains, and recruitment of effector proteins such as PLC, Shc, Grb2, RhoGAP, and PI3K to the activated receptor (reviewed in Ullrich and Schlessinger, 1990; Schlessinger, 1997). In contrast to growth factor receptors, antigen receptors activate a cascade of cytoplasmic PTKs to regulate these downstream effector functions (reviewed in Chan et al., 1994; DeFranco, 1997; Reth and Wienands, 1997). Our studies here define an additional level of regulation

Figure 5. BLNK Regulates PLCγ Tyrosine Phosphorylation

(A) Tyrosine phosphorylation of stably transfected BLNK proteins. Myc-BLNK(WT) or Myc-BLNK(4F) was stably expressed in Daudi cells. BLNK proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed by immunoblotting with an anti-PTyr MAb (top panel) or an anti-BLNK MAb (bottom panel). WT, Myc-BLNK(WT); C, vector control; 4F, Myc-BLNK(4F). The data shown here are representative of at least two clones of each transfected cDNA.

(B) Regulation of PLCγ1/γ2 tyrosine phosphorylation by BLNK. PLCγ1/γ2 (lanes 1–6) were immunoprecipitated from either resting (−) or BCR-stimulated (+) Daudi clones that overexpress BLNK(WT) (lanes 1–2), vector control (lanes 3–4), or BLNK(4F) (lanes 5–6), and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. The antiserum used for immunoprecipitation recognizes both PLCγ1 and PLCγ2. Lanes 7–12 represent Shc immunoprecipitates from either resting (−) or BCR-stimulated (+) Daudi clones that overexpress wild-type BLNK (lanes 7–8), vector control (lanes 9–10), or BLNK(4F) (lanes 11–12) immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. Similar data were observed from a minimum of two independent clones for each cDNA.

(C) BLNK facilitates PLCγ1 tyrosine phosphorylation by Syk. FLAG-tagged PLCγ1 was coexpressed in insect Sf9 cells with Myc-BLNK (lane 1), coexpressed with GST-Syk (lane 2), or coexpressed with GST-Syk and Myc-BLNK (lane 3). Forty hours following infection, FLAG-PLCγ1 was immunoprecipitated and immunoblotted with an anti-PTyr MAb (PY20, top panel). Expression levels of FLAG-PLCγ1, GST-Syk, and Myc-BLNK were confirmed by immunoblotting analysis as demonstrated in the bottom three panels.

mediated by linker proteins that permits the BCR-activated PTKs to activate downstream effector proteins.

We report here the identification and characterization of a novel PTK substrate, BLNK, which is phosphorylated by Syk. Overexpression of wild-type BLNK results in enhanced tyrosine phosphorylation of PLCγ, receptor-mediated calcium responses and transcriptional activation of NF-AT. Conversely, expression of a dominant negative mutant of BLNK results in decreased PLCγ tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium, and NF-AT responses. That BLNK is phosphorylated by Syk and enhances PLCγ phosphorylation by Syk indicates two distinct functions for BLNK in B cell activation. First, tyrosine phosphorylation of BLNK recruits PLCγ to BLNK. Second, the colocalization of BLNK with Syk (C. F. and A. C. C., unpublished data), in turn, facilitates the tyrosine phosphorylation and subsequent activation of the associated PLCγ. These results suggest that BLNK likely bridges the BCR-associated PTKs with PLCγ-mediated signaling pathways.

The association of BLNK with Grb2 and, in turn, the SoS guanine nucleotide exchange factor as well as the translocation of BLNK from the cytoplasmic to membrane fraction provides a mechanism by which BLNK/Grb2/SoS complexes may regulate the Ras pathway. However, we were unable to detect any significant differences in the activation of Erk1 and Erk2 in cells overexpressing BLNK(WT) or BLNK(4F) (data not shown). Our inability to detect significant differences in activation of the MAPK pathway may reflect the redundancy of signaling pathways leading to Ras activation. In B cells, the Shc adapter protein has been proposed to link the BCR with Ras activation (Saxton et al., 1994; Smit et al., 1994; D'Ambrosio et al., 1996; Harmer and DeFranco, 1997). Analysis of Shc mutants that cannot bind Grb2 do not exhibit any effects on Erk1 or Erk2 activation (Harmer and DeFranco, 1997) and may reflect the ability of BLNK to regulate Grb2/SoS independent of Shc/Grb2 complexes. Similar degrees of redundancy have been demonstrated for Ras activation by the BCR-ABL oncogene and the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor (Gotoh et al., 1994; Goga et al., 1995). Mutation of the

(A) Regulation of [Ca²⁺]i by BLNK. [Ca²⁺]i was measured by spectrofluorimetry following stimulation with an anti-hIgM F(ab')₂ Ab (3 μg/ml). The left column depicts two representative clones overexpressing BLNK(WT) or parental control cells. The right column depicts two representative clones expressing BLNK(4F) or parental control cells. This data is representative of greater than ten independent experiments of multiple clones.

(B) Increased NF-AT transcriptional activity by BLNK(WT). A control plasmid vector or a vector encoding Myc-BLNK(WT) at the indicated concentrations was transiently cotransfected into 10⁷A20 cells with a NF-AT reporter plasmid as described in Experimental Procedures. Induction of NF-AT activity was analyzed in resting cells, cells stimulated with an anti-mouse IgG F(ab')₂ fragment (4.0 μg/ml), or cells stimulated with 0.5 μg/ml PDBu and 0.5 μM ionomycin for 6 hr. Data are graphed as percentage of luciferase activity compared to cells stimulated with PDBu plus ionomycin. Cells (2 × 10⁵) were lysed and analyzed for Myc-BLNK overexpression, as compared to endogenous BLNK in the right panel. Data are representative of greater than five independent experiments.

(C) Attenuation of NF-AT transcriptional activity by BLNK(4F). A control plasmid vector or the indicated concentrations of a vector encoding Myc-BLNK(4F) was transiently cotransfected into A20 cells with a NF-AT reporter plasmid as described in Figure 6B. The level of expression of Myc-BLNK(4F) as compared to endogenous BLNK was determined by immunoblotting with an anti-BLNK antiserum (right panel). Data are representative of greater than five independent experiments.

Grb2-binding sites within BCR-ABL retained the ability of the BCR-ABL mutant to transform hematopoietic cells through a Shc/Grb2-mediated pathway (Goga et al., 1995). In addition, an EGFR that is unable to bind Grb2 can still induce Shc phosphorylation and Ras activation (Gotoh et al., 1994). Hence, multiple signaling mechanisms likely contribute to Ras activation, and the BLNK/Grb2 interaction likely contributes to one of these pathways in B cell function.

The BLNK polypeptide demonstrates its highest homology (~33% amino acid identity) to the SLP-76 linker protein that we and others have demonstrated to be an in vivo substrate for ZAP-70 and Syk (J ackman et al., 1995; Bubeck-Wardenburg et al., 1996; Raab et al.,

(Zhang et al., 1998). While T cells appear to utilize two linker proteins (SLP-76 and LAT), both of which are substrates of ZAP-70, B cells appear to utilize a single linker protein—BLNK. Neither SLP-76 nor LAT are expressed in B cells (Fu and Chan, 1997; Zhang et al., 1998). In addition, we do not detect the binding of any tyrosine phosphoproteins in the 30–45 K M range to PLC, Grb2, or Vav (data not shown). Moreover, while SLP-76 and LAT interacts in vivo with Nck, Vav, Grb2, and PLC (J ackman et al., 1995; Onodera et al., 1996; Tuosto et al., 1996; Wu et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 1998; J . B. W. and A. C. C., unpublished data), BLNK interacts in vivo with all four effector proteins. Together, these data indicate that BLNK likely serves as the central linker protein to link the BCR-activated PTKs with these effector functions.

The presence of multiple tyrosine residues within BLNK further supports the idea that BLNK can serve as a scaffold for the spectrum of effector proteins. Each tyrosine residue may demonstrate specificity for a specific effector protein. Hence, specific binding sites within BLNK may dictate specificity of downstream signaling pathways. In addition, the recruitment of distinct effector molecules to BLNK may also permit different effectors to integrate their functions. Alternatively, but not exclusively, an effector protein may be able to bind at multiple tyrosine sites and provide amplification for the signaling cascade. For example, the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) contains six YMXM motifs that can bind the p85 subunit of PI3K and thereby amplify activation of the phosphoinositide pathway (Sun et al., 1991). Analysis of each BLNK phosphorylation site is presently underway to distinguish between these possibilities. Finally, these linker proteins also contain SH2 domains, which themselves may recruit additional downstream effector proteins such as FYB/SLAP-130, as in the case of SLP-76, to further modulate lymphocyte function (da Silva et al., 1997; Musci et al., 1997a). Hence, the consortium of effector proteins present within these macromolecular complexes likely enables the integration of signaling components to coordinate downstream effector functions required for lymphocyte function.

**Experimental Procedures**

**Cells and Antibodies**

Cell lines were maintained as recommended by the ATCC. A rabbit anti-hBLNK antiserum (1791) was generated against a GST-fusion protein encoding amino acids 324–456. A mouse anti-BLNK monoclonal antibody (2C9 MAb) was generated against a GST-fusion protein encoding amino acids 4–205 of hBLNK. Additional antibodies used include anti-PYr MAb (PY20, Transduction Labs), anti-Vav antiserum and MAb (UBI), anti-PLCγ1/2 antiserum (UBI), anti-PLCγ2 antiserum (Santa Cruz Biotechnology), anti-β-actin MAb (Sigma), anti-GST MAb (SCB), anti-Myc MAb (9E10), anti-Grb2 antiserum and MAb (SCB and Transduction Labs), anti-SoS1 MAb (Transduction Labs), anti-Nck antiserum and MAb (J . B. W. and A. C. C., unpublished data, and Transduction Labs), anti-Shc antiserum and MAb (UBI and SCB), anti-CD45 antiserum (McFarland et al., 1997), anti-J NK1 antiserum (SCB), and anti-FLAG MAb (Kodak).

**Purification of pp70 and pp68**

Ramos cells (1.5 × 10^10^) were pelleted at 1000 RPM for 10 min and resuspended at a concentration of 2 × 10^8^/ml. Cells were activated with 24 μg/ml goat anti-hIgM F(ab)′~2~ fragment () jackson Labs) for 2 min at 37°C and lysed with an equal volume of lysis buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl) as previously described (Fu

and Chan, 1997). Cell lysates were pooled and clarified by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 20 min and 100,000 g for 40 min at 4°C. Supernatants were passed through an immobilized GST-Sephrose. The flowthrough was incubated with an affinity column containing 4 mg GST-PLCγ1-SH2(C) immobilized on 1 ml Glutathione-Sepharose. Beads were then washed with 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer containing 0.5 M NaCl, 10 bed volumes of lysis buffer, and eluted twice with 2 ml lysis buffer containing 1% SDS for 5 min at 95°C. The eluate was adjusted to 0.1% SDS. The diluted sample was incubated with 1 ml 50% slurry of an anti-pTyr MAb (PY20) immobilized on protein A-Sepharose (1 mg/ml) for 5 hr at 4°C. Beads were washed with 20 ml of lysis buffer followed by 20 ml of buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 25 mM NaCl) and eluted with 2 ml of 100 mM phenylphosphate (Sigma) in buffer A. Eluates were adjusted to 0.1% SDS and dialyzed overnight against buffer A containing 0.1% SDS. Three similar preparations were combined and the final sample was concentrated using a Centriplus Concentrator (Amicon). Proteins were resolved on a 7% SDS-polyacrylamide gel and visualized with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 (Biorad). Bands corresponding to pp70 and pp68 (~5 μg) were excised and subjected to in-gel digestion with endoproteinase Lys-C (Boehringer Mannheim) as described (Hellman et al., 1995). Peptides were separated using RP-HPLC on a microbore C8 column (Vydac) and individual peptides analyzed with a protein sequencer (Model 482, Perkin Elmer).

### Construction of Plasmids

A Myc-tagged human BLNK (pp70) was generated by appending the Myc sequence (SMEQKLISEEDLN) to the N terminus of BLNK. Myc-BLNK(4F) was constructed by PCR-directed mutagenesis and subcloned into the pApuro vector for transfection into mammalian cells, and the pVL1393 vector (Invitrogen) for insect cell expression (Kong et al., 1995; Bubeck-Wardenburg et al., 1996). The human Btk cDNA was obtained by RT-PCR from Ramos mRNA and the Lyn cDNA was provided by Dr. Link (Washington University). Lyn and Btk PTks were cloned into pVIKS for baculoviral-mediated expression as GST-fusion proteins.

### Cell Stimulation, Lysis, Immunoprecipitation, and \[Ca^{2+}\]i Fluorimetry

Daudi cells (10^8 cells/ml) were stimulated with a 24 μg/ml goat anti-hIgM F(ab)'2 fragment (Jackson Labs) at 37°C for 1.5 min. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation at 14,000 RPM and lysed in an equal volume of cold lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. DT40 cells were stimulated with 4 μg/ml anti-chicken IgM MAb (M4) in a similar fashion. Pervanadate stimulation was performed as previously described (Secrist et al., 1993). Cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation (15,000 g × 10 min) and the supernatants were subjected to immunoprecipitation (2 × 10^7 cells/lane) and/or immunoblotting. \[Ca^{2+}\]i was measured as previously described (Kong et al., 1995).

### Transfection of Cells

Transfection of Daudi, DT40, and A20 cells was performed as described previously (Chan et al., 1995; Bubeck-Wardenburg et al., 1996). The settings used for electroporation of A20 cells were 1200 μF, 300 V, and a resistance setting of R6 on an Electro Cell Manipulator 600 (BTX). Infection of insect cells and production of baculoviral stocks were performed as previously described (Chan et al., 1995).

### Subcellular Fractionation

Daudi cells (5 × 10^7 cells/ml) were either left unstimulated, stimulated with a 24 μg/ml goat anti-hIgM F(ab)'2 fragment at 37°C for 2 min, or stimulated with pervanadate at room temperature for 10 min (Secrist et al., 1993). Cells were precipitated and resuspended in an equal volume of ice-cold hypotonic buffer (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 1 mM MgCl2) containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. The cell suspension was homogenized until >95% of the cells were disrupted. Cell lysates were adjusted to 150 mM NaCl and clarified twice (800 g × 10 min) to remove nuclei. The supernatant, which contains the cytosolic and membrane fractions, was further centrifuged at 100,000 g for 30 min. The cytosolic supernatant was adjusted to 0.1% SDS, 0.1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycholate. The pellet was extracted with one-tenth supernatant volume

of 1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, and 1% sodium deoxycholate in TBS (10 mM Tris [pH 8.0], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2) and then diluted 10-fold to produce the membrane fraction.
