CELL DEATH AND AUTOPHAGY — OPINION

Regulated necrosis: the expanding network of non-apoptotic cell death pathways

Tom Vanden Berghe, Andreas Linkermann, Sandrine Jouan-Lanhuet, Henning Walczak and Peter Vandenabeele

Abstract | Cell death research was revitalized by the understanding that necrosis can occur in a highly regulated and genetically controlled manner. Although RIPK1 (receptor-interacting protein kinase 1)- and RIPK3–MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like)-mediated necroptosis is the most understood form of regulated necrosis, other examples of this process are emerging, including cell death mechanisms known as parthanatos, oxytosis, ferroptosis, NETosis, pyronecrosis and pyroptosis. Elucidating how these pathways of regulated necrosis are interconnected at the molecular level should enable this process to be therapeutically targeted.

The development and homeostasis of organisms depends on the balance between cell survival and cell death — simply put, there is no life without death. In 1842, Karl Vogt, while studying the metamorphosis of amphibians, realized that the resorption of the notochord and its replacement by vertebrae involved physiological cell death¹. The concept of ‘programmed cell death’ was conceived more than a century later, in 1964, when Lockshin and Williams described regulated cell death during insect metamorphosis². Schweichel and Merker were subsequently the first to report the presence of three distinct cell death morphologies in rat embryos, after exposure to toxins, which also occur with very low frequency in the developing mouse: type I cell death was associated with heterophagy (‘eating of another’); type II cell death was associated with autophagy (‘eating of itself’); and type III cell death did not involve digestion³. Today, these cell death modes are referred to as apoptosis, cell death associated with autophagy and necrosis, respectively. Pioneering work in *Caenorhabditis elegans* revealed the genetic programme of apoptosis⁴, whereas its biochemical mechanisms have been elucidated in various animal models⁵⁶. We currently understand cell death as a fundamental process that is regulated by multiple interconnected signalling pathways, and we are starting to decipher how cell death influences processes in addition to development, such as chemotaxis, phagocytosis, regeneration and immunogenicity⁷.

For two decades, apoptosis was considered to be the standard cell death form during development, homeostasis, infection and pathogenesis⁶⁸, whereas necrosis was mostly considered to be an ‘accidental’ cell death that occurred in response to physicochemical insults. Recent genetic evidence⁹⁻¹⁶, as well as the discovery of chemical inhibitors of necrosis¹⁰,¹⁷,¹⁸, have greatly changed this view, and revealed the existence of multiple pathways of regulated necrosis. Regulated necrosis is defined as a genetically controlled cell death process that eventually results in cellular leakage, and it is morphologically characterized by cytoplasmic granulation, as well as organelle and/or cellular swelling (‘oncosis’). Multiple modes of cell death share these morphological hallmarks, and they now need to be examined for common or distinct underlying signalling pathways. Attempts to define and classify forms of cell death and their underlying pathways have resulted in multiple neologisms, such as necroptosis, parthanatos, oxytosis, ferroptosis, ETosis, NETosis, pyronecrosis and pyroptosis; all of these processes are characterized by a particular aspect of the cell death process. We propose that these alternative types of cell death are considered as forms of regulated necrosis. In an attempt to integrate the different subroutines of regulated necrosis schematically, we have classified the mechanistic steps of each into four levels (FIG. 1): a trigger (level 1) activates an initiator mechanism (level 2). This subsequently activates several mediators that propagate the signal (level 3) and ultimately relay it to overlapping biochemical mechanisms (executioners) that cause necrotic cell death (level 4). In this Opinion article we first describe necroptosis, the form of regulated necrosis that is best understood at the molecular level, and then consider the emerging modes of regulated necrosis with a focus on levels 1 and 2 in the molecular cascade. We then integrate the signalling pathways of regulated necrosis by mapping the connections and overlaps between them, with the aim of identifying common mediators (level 3) and executioner mechanisms (level 4). Finally, we explore how the expanding network of regulated necrosis pathways could be therapeutically targeted.

**Necroptosis: the prototype**

Although tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necrotic cell death¹⁹,²⁰ and its negative regulation by caspases²¹ have been studied since the late 1980s, the broad interest in regulated necrosis was prompted by the discovery that receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1)⁹,¹⁶,¹⁸,²² and RIPK3 (REFS 12–15) are crucial kinases in TNF-induced regulated necrosis⁹. Since then, an assortment of necroptosis triggers have been identified (BOX 1). This molecular revelation, and the evidence that necrosis is genetically regulated, led to the term necroptosis to define regulated necrosis that is dependent on RIPK1 and/or RIPK3 activity²². Necrostatin 1 (NEC1) was identified as a potent inhibitor of necroptosis owing to its ability to block the kinase activity of RIPK1 (REFS 16,18).

Figure 1 | An integrated view of the emerging modes of regulated necrosis. Regulated necrosis can be induced by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation, mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), mitochondrial complex I, the Cys/Glu antiporter, the necrosome, NADPH oxidases and the inflammasome. Diverse pathophysiological stimuli can trigger (level 1) each of these initiators (level 2), which can be blocked by the listed specific inhibitors. The coloured arrows indicate the established links between the initiator signals and various common intracellular mechanisms that mediate regulated necrosis (level 3), such as NAD⁺ and ATP-depletion, Ca²⁺ overload, dysregulation of the redox status, increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the activity of phospholipases. All of these factors are mediators of regulated necrosis, and even at this level, inhibitors such as dantrolene, BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole), NAC (N-acetyl-Cys), BEL (bromoenol lactone) and MAFP (methyl-arachidonyl fluorophosphonate) may interfere with necrotic signalling. Importantly, similar mediators can act downstream of various initiators, through different mechanisms. The complex interconnected effects of the mediators on cellular organelles and membranes results in the activation of processes that execute regulated necrosis (level 4), including cellular osmotic swelling, bioenergetic breakdown that results in energetic catastrophe, lipid peroxidation and the loss of lysosomal membrane integrity through lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP).

The molecular pathway of necroptosis. The induction of necroptosis can be exemplified by the TNF signalling pathway. Upon stimulation of TNFR1 (TNF receptor 1) by TNF, a RIPK1- and TRADD (TNFR1-associated death domain)-dependent receptor-bound complex I is formed, which is pivotal for the activation of NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) and the resulting upregulation of anti-apoptotic genes such as A20 and Flip<sub>L</sub> (FLICE-like inhibitory protein long isoform) (FIG. 2a). In a negative feedback loop, the deubiquitylating activity of A20 is believed to restrict TNF-induced NF-κB signalling by removing Lys63-linked polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1 (REF. 24). Moreover, cylindromatosis (CYLD) also removes polyubiquitin chains from RIPK1, which results in the dissociation of RIPK1 from TNFR1 and the formation of a cytosolic death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) (FIG. 2b). FAS-associated death domain (FADD), RIPK3, FLIPs and pro-caspase 8 are members of this newly identified complex, which is called complex IIa and is dependent on TRADD for its formation<sup>25</sup>. It is believed that FLIP<sub>L</sub>, which is upregulated by NF-κB, and pro-caspase 8 form heterodimers that cleave and inactivate RIPK1, RIPK3 and CYLD to prevent necroptosis. Pro-caspase 8 homodimers are thought to undergo rapid autoproteolysis that results in caspase 8 activation, and its dissociation from TRADD-dependent complex IIa; caspase 8 then activates the executioner caspases caspase 3 and caspase 7 to execute apoptosis. However, when caspase 8 is inhibited by caspase inhibitors or virally expressed proteins, RIPK1 and RIPK3 associate, autophosphorylate and transphosphorylate each other<sup>12,13,15</sup>, and eventually aggregate in microfilament-like complexes<sup>26</sup> that are referred to as necrosomes<sup>11</sup>. Under these caspase-inhibitory conditions, CYLD deubiquitylates RIPK1 in the necrosome to facilitate kinase activation and regulated necrosis<sup>27</sup> (FIG. 2c). The phosphorylation of human RIPK3 at Ser227 or mouse RIPK3 at Ser232 is essential to recruit MLKL (mixed lineage kinase domain-like)<sup>10,28–30</sup>. MLKL is subsequently phosphorylated at Thr357 and Ser358 by human RIPK3 (REF. 10) or at Ser345, Ser347, Ser352 and Thr349 by mouse RIPK3 (REF. 30). This results in a late wave of JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation<sup>31</sup>, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production<sup>31,32</sup> and the induction of necrosis.

Many triggers of necroptosis have been identified (see the figure). These include TNF (tumour necrosis factor)⁹, CD95L (also known as FASL and APO-1L)⁹, TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand; also known as APO-2L)⁹, TWEAK (TNF-related weak inducer of apoptosis)¹⁵⁷, genotoxic stress¹⁵⁸,¹⁵⁹, polyclonal stimulation of TCR (T cell receptor)¹⁶⁰, virus-mediated activation of DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors (DAI)⁵⁰ and anticancer drugs such as shikonin¹⁶²,¹⁶³ and GX15-070 (obatoclax, Cephalon)¹⁶⁴. Necroptosis can also be triggered by PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns) such as: polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C))-mediated activation of Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3)²²,⁵⁸; retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG-I)-like receptors (RLRs), such as RIG-I or MDA5 (melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5)¹⁶¹; or LPS (lipopolysaccharide)-mediated activation of TLR4 (REF. 12). Recently, IFNs (interferons) were also shown to induce necroptosis, in a manner dependent on the STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription)-dependent expression of PKR (protein kinase R), in cells that were transiently deficient in apoptosis owing to phosphorylated FADD (FAS-associated death domain) during mitosis¹⁶⁵. Considering that PKR is activated by viral RNA during acute virus infections to block translation¹⁶⁶, this could imply that PKR may also act as a platform to induce the lytic cycle via regulated necrosis.

Typically, necroptosis is induced upon caspase 8 inhibition, as was originally observed in vitro²¹,¹⁶⁷ and confirmed in caspase 8-deficient mice¹⁶⁸,¹⁶⁹ and FADD-deficient mice¹⁷⁰,¹⁷¹. Of note, necroptotic damage can be reversed by receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) deficiency in caspase 8-knockout mice¹⁶⁸,¹⁶⁹, and by RIPK3 (REF. 172) or RIPK1 (REF. 171) deficiency in FADD-deficient mice. The pharmacological inhibition of necroptosis — for example, by using necrostatin 1 (NEC1) — or the genetic ablation of RIPK3 or mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) has shown that necroptosis can also occur in the absence of caspase inhibition in various pathological settings, such as ischaemic or traumatic brain injury¹⁸,¹⁷³, myocardial infarction¹⁷⁴, retinal ischaemia¹⁷⁵, photoreceptor cell loss¹⁷⁶,¹⁷⁷, renal ischaemia–reperfusion injury¹⁷⁸, experimental pancreatitis¹⁵,¹³⁴, skin necroptosis¹⁷⁹, Salmonella enterica infection¹⁸⁰, TNF-induced systemic inflammatory response syndrome¹⁸¹ and atherosclerosis¹⁸². Finally, low levels of MLKL were recently found to be associated with decreased overall survival in patients with early-stage resected pancreatic adenocarcinoma¹⁸³, which indicates a correlation between chemo-sensitivity and the induction of regulated necrosis.

PERSPECTIVES

Figure 2 | TNFR1-mediated necroptosis: the prototype of regulated necrosis.

a | Upon stimulation with tumour necrosis factor (TNF), TNF receptor-associated death domain (TRADD), which in turn attracts receptor-interacting protein kinase 1 (RIPK1), cellular inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP1), cIAP2, TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) and TRAF5. RIPK1 is then subject to Lys63-linked polyubiquitylation by cIAP1 and cIAP2, which allows docking of TAK1 (transforming growth factor-β-activated kinase 1) in complex with TAB2 (TAK1 binding protein 2) or TAB3, as well as of the IKK (inhibitor of NF-κB kinase) complex. The assembly of the IKK complex activates the NF-κB (nuclear factor-κB) pathway, which is enhanced by the recruitment of the LUBAC (linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex) through the linear ubiquitin chains on RIPK1.

b | Subsequently, cylindromatosis (CYLD) removes Lys63-linked polyubiquitins from RIPK1, rendering complex I unstable and allowing RIPK1 to dissociate from the plasma membrane and to interact with TRADD, FAS-associated death domain (FADD), pro-caspase 8 and FLICE-like inhibitory proteins (FLIPs). The long isoform of FLIP (FLIP<sub>L</sub>) and pro-caspase 8 form a heterodimeric caspase that cleaves and inactivates RIPK1 and RIPK3, as well as CYLD, to prevent necroptosis (dashed ovals indicate cleaved proteins). This TRADD-dependent complex IIa also allows caspase 8 homodimerization and activation, which activates the executioner caspases caspase 3 and caspase 7, resulting in apoptosis.

c | However, when caspase 8 is inhibited by chemical caspase inhibitors or virally encoded proteins such as CrmA (cytokine response modifier protein A) or vIRA (viral inhibitor of RIP activation), the RHIM (RIP homotypic interaction motif) domains of RIPK1 and RIPK3 associate in microfilament-like complexes called necrosomes. The auto- and transphosphorylation of RIPK1 and RIPK3 and the recruitment of mixed lineage kinase domain-like (MLKL) initiate necroptosis. Several events could mediate necroptosis, including GRIM19 (gene associated with retinoic and interferon-induced mortality 19)-mediated ROS (reactive oxygen species) production, JUN N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation or the translocation of the necrosome to mitochondria-associated membranes.

d | When cells are depleted of cIAPs—for example, by SMAC (second mitochondria-derived activator of caspase) mimetics—and RIPK1 is thus not ubiquitylated (indicated by a question mark), the formation of complex I leads to the upregulation of NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) and the activation of the non-canonical NF-κB pathway.

e | Moreover, in the absence of cIAPs, a large TRADD-independent cytosolic complex is formed between RIPK1, RIPK3, FADD and the FLIP<sub>L</sub>-caspase 8 heterodimer, which is referred to as RIPK1-dependent complex IIb or the ‘ripoptosome’. As is the case in complex IIa, RIPK1 and RIPK3 are inactivated through cleavage that is mediated by caspase 8–FLIP<sub>L</sub> heterodimers, apoptosis is induced by the release of caspase 8 homodimers and necroptosis is induced when the function or recruitment of caspase 8 is defective. NSA (necrosulfonamide) only acts on human MLKL (c). NEC1s, more specific and stable variant of necrostatin 1; NEMO, NF-κB essential modulator.

Necroptosis in pathology. Mice deficient for RIPK3 or MLKL, the central inducers of necroptosis, did not show defects in development or during homeostasis<sup>36,49</sup>, which illustrates that necroptosis is not required during these processes. Interestingly, viruses can interfere with necroptosis<sup>50</sup>, highlighting its physiological relevance as an antiviral mechanism, as is demonstrated by the fact that RIPK3-deficient mice die after challenge with vaccinia virus<sup>13</sup>. Some viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, have developed a strategy to interfere with this host antiviral response. For example, the viral inhibitor of RIPK1 activation (vIRA) and the viral inhibitor of caspase 8 activation (vICA) prevent the activation of both necroptosis<sup>51</sup> and apoptosis<sup>52</sup>, respectively by TNF. In many settings necroptosis dysregulation contributes to tissue damage and inflammation (BOX 1), and has thus been found to contribute to several pathologies. An important milestone in necroptosis research was the discovery of the RIPK1 inhibitor NEC1, which blocks necroptosis and, under certain conditions, also apoptosis<sup>53</sup> (FIG. 2). Therefore, data generated using NEC1 should be interpreted
with caution. In addition, NEC1 targets the immunomodulatory enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), and this may markedly influence immune responses<sup>54,55</sup>. The use of the NEC-1 analogue NEC1s (also known as 7-Cl-O-NEC1 or NEC1 stable)<sup>18,56</sup>, which is more selective for RIPK1 and more stable *in vivo*, or the use of RIPK1 or RIPK3 kinase-dead (catalytically inactive) knock-in mice is required to assess the unique role of RIPK1 and RIPK3 kinase activity in disease models. Recently, another potent NEC1 analogue (NEC21) was reported to show an improved off-target profile, which will be useful in further dissecting the potential clinical relevance of targeting RIPK1 kinase activity<sup>57</sup>. RIPK3 inhibitors<sup>58</sup> or allosteric inhibitors of MLKL<sup>10</sup> might be more specific than NEC1s given that RIPK1 kinase activity can also contribute to apoptosis<sup>53,59</sup>, inflammasome activation<sup>60</sup> and interleukin-1α (IL-1α) release<sup>61</sup>. All of these data suggest that the *in vivo* efficacy of RIPK1 inhibition may be because it targets multiple processes beyond necroptosis.

### Emerging mechanisms

This section describes the molecular events that initiate emerging pathways of regulated necrosis, including ferroptosis, oxytosis, ETosis, NETosis, cyclophilin D (CYPD)-mediated regulated necrosis, parthanatos, pyroptosis and pyronecrosis, with a focus on the triggers and initiators of these pathways (FIG. 1). As these necrotic-like cell death processes are consistent with the morphological definition of regulated necrosis, but are either reported to occur independently of RIPK1 or RIPK3, or have been shown to occur in the presence of RIPK1 or RIPK3 inhibitors<sup>58</sup>, they could be considered as specialized forms of regulated necrosis. Basically, all of these cell death processes represent a form of genetically controlled cellular explosion following a stage of oncosis. The different names for regulated necrosis refer to this process occurring in different physiological conditions, such as cellular stress, pathogen infection or ischaemia–reperfusion injury (IRI), or in particular cell types. These neologisms may therefore only reflect different pathways towards a conserved pool of mediators and executioners of regulated necrosis that results in a similar outcome.

#### Ferroptosis and oxytosis

It was recently shown that RAS-transformed tumour cells, treated with a lethal small molecule called erastin, undergo regulated necrosis that seems to be partially mediated through inhibiting the system X<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> Cys/Glu antiporter, which allows the exchange of extracellular L-Cys and intracellular L-Glu across the plasma membrane (FIG. 3a). This type of cell death was defined as ferroptosis because it crucially depends on intracellular iron metabolism and its chemical inhibitor was dubbed ferrostatin 1 (REF 62), but the mechanism of action for this compound still remains unclear. It is believed that ROS generated by Fenton-type reactions, rather than the mitochondrial electron transport chain, are the main drivers of ferroptosis. Glutathione (GSH) peroxidase 4 (GPX4) is a crucial inhibitor of ferroptosis, and its activity relies on GSH levels. Therefore, GSH depletion typically leads to loss-of-function of GPX4, resulting in ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation<sup>63</sup>. In addition to ferroptosis, Glu<sup>62</sup> and oxidative stress-induced<sup>64,65</sup> cell death are inhibited by iron chelation. In line with this, iron-dependent neuronal cell death is blocked by metal protein-attenuating compounds (for example, clioquinol) and iron chelators (for example, desferrioxamine), which are being used in clinical trials for treating neurodegenerative diseases<sup>45</sup>.

Originally, cell death induced when the system X<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> Cys/Glu antiporter is inhibited by an excess of the neurotransmitter Glu was classified as oxytosis<sup>66</sup>, or excitotoxicity in neuronal cells<sup>67</sup>. Inhibition of the antiporter reduces the level of intracellular L-Cys required for GSH synthesis. This results in GSH depletion, which activates 12-lipoxygenase (LOX12) and LOX15 to initiate mitochondrial ROS production and an increase in cyclic GMP (cGMP)<sup>66</sup>. cGMP opens cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane, allowing calcium influx<sup>68</sup> (FIG. 3a). The ‘calpain–cathepsin cascade’<sup>69</sup> occurs downstream of this calcium-wave and involves the activation of calpains by calcium, which triggers lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) to induce regulated necrosis; this seems to be conserved from nematodes to primates<sup>70</sup>. Despite a clear mechanistic overlap between oxytosis and ferroptosis, including the dependence on inhibition of the system X<sub>c</sub><sup>−</sup> Cys/Glu antiporter, a decrease in GSH levels and the presence of lipid peroxidation, ferroptosis seems to depend mainly on iron instead of calcium signalling<sup>62</sup>. The negative control of lipid peroxidation by GPX4, at least in a neuronal context, was previously shown and supported by the observation that inducible *Gpx4* inactivation in neurons also results in neurodegeneration<sup>71</sup>. In summary, ferroptosis and/or oxytosis are typically observed in the context of cancer and neurodegeneration, which may reflect their high demand for iron and calcium metabolism, respectively.

#### NETosis and ETosis

Whereas most sources of ROS are generated as metabolic byproducts, the NADPH oxidase (NOX) family constitutes the only known enzyme family with the sole function of producing ROS in physiological settings<sup>72</sup>. The contribution of NOX activity to cell death is especially clear in neurodegeneration<sup>73</sup>, brain injury<sup>74</sup> and heart failure<sup>75</sup>, conditions in which regulated necrosis has been implicated. Future research is required to determine how NOX-induced regulated necrosis might contribute to other emerging forms of this cell death mode. NOX1-mediated necrosis was shown to contribute to ferroptosis<sup>62</sup>, and NOX1 is also recruited to the TNFR1 by riboflavin kinase<sup>60,76</sup> (FIG. 3b) to contribute to necroptosis. Recently, IL-1β release was shown to be dependent on NOX-derived ROS in human neutrophils<sup>77</sup>, whereas caspase 1-mediated NOX2 activation was shown to be crucial for phagosome function<sup>78</sup>, which illustrates that NOX2 can also be activated during pyroptosis (see below).

The best studied model of NOX-induced cell death is probably NETosis<sup>79</sup>, a neutrophil specific form of ETosis. NETosis is a specialized form of neutrophil death that releases neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs)<sup>80</sup>. These are composed of chromatin and histones, and enable neutrophils to immobilize and kill bacteria. As NETosis is also characterized by the controlled release of the intracellular content of neutrophils, it is also a form of regulated necrosis. In contrast to apoptosis, DNA decondenses during NETosis to let the chromatin unfold in the extracellular space upon plasma membrane rupture<sup>81</sup>. Although NOX contributes to NETosis, RIPK1 kinase activity is not implicated in NETosis<sup>81</sup>. In addition to neutrophils, NETosis was described for eosinophils and mast cells<sup>79</sup>. Therefore, the more generalized term ‘ETosis’ has been introduced<sup>82</sup>. Although the occurrence of NET formation *in vivo* was questioned, Gram-positive bacteria that cause skin infections were recently shown to rapidly induce NETs<sup>83</sup>. In humans, the importance of NOX is illustrated by congenital defects that result in chronic granulomatous disease, which is characterized by aberrant immune responses and recurrent life-threatening infections by a narrow set of microorganisms<sup>84</sup>. Taken together, the evidence suggests that NETosis could be considered as a form of regulated necrosis that is typically observed in neutrophils as an antibacterial immune defence mechanism.

Figure 3 | Emerging modes of regulated necrosis involving the cellular redox metabolome.  
a | The system X⁻ Cys/Glu antiporter mediates the exchange of extracellular L-Cys and intracellular L-Glu across the cell plasma membrane. Inhibition of the antiporter during oxytosis reduces the level of intracellular L-Cys, an amino acid that is required for the synthesis of glutathione (GSH). This results in GSH depletion, which activates 12-lipoxygenase (LOX12) and LOX15 to initiate mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and an increase in cyclic GMP (cGMP). cGMP opens cGMP-gated channels on the plasma membrane, allowing Ca²⁺ influx. Calpains are activated by high intracellular Ca²⁺ levels and facilitate lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP), which results in regulated necrosis. The small molecule erastin triggers ferroptosis by inhibiting the system X⁻ Cys/Glu antiporter, which blocks the reduction of cystine to Cys, resulting in GSH depletion-induced loss-of-function of GSH peroxidase 4 (GPX4), high intracellular levels of H₂O₂ and lipid peroxidation. Iron chelators scavenge accumulated iron in lysosomes to inhibit Fenton-type reactions and ferroptosis. Ferrostatin 1 (FER1) is a chemical inhibitor of ferroptosis, but its target is still unknown.  
b | NOX (NADPH oxidase) can be activated by stimuli such as fMLP (N-formylated methionyl-leucyl-Phe), PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) and LPS (lipopolysaccharide), which leads to ROS production with NADPH as a cofactor and regulated necrosis as a result. NOX also contributes to ferroptosis and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced necroptosis, the latter as a result of TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) activating riboflavin kinase (RFK). NOX can be inhibited by diphenylene iodonium (DPI) or GKT (GKT137831; a NOX1 and NOX4 inhibitor; Genkyotex).  
c | The matrix protein cyclophilin D (CYPD) has peptidyl prolyl isomerase activity and is thought to aid the opening of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP).

This pore opens upon persistent stimulation by thapsigargin, Ca²⁺, ROS or following ischaemia-reperfusion injury (IRI), which results in the translocation of NAD⁺ from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol and loss of mitochondrial potential. An inverse activity of F₀F₁ ATPase (ATP hydrolysis) aims to restore the mitochondrial potential. Subsequently, cellular NAD⁺ pools are further depleted by NAD⁺ glycohydrolases (GH). This, combined with ATP depletion, leads to regulated necrosis. CYPD-MPT-mediated necrosis can be blocked by immunosuppressive drugs such as cyclosporin A (CsA) or sanglifehrin A (SfA). The MPTP may include the F₀F₁ ATPase and might be regulated by p53.  
d | Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) is activated by DNA damage (induced by UV (ultraviolet) light), ROS or alkylating agents such as MNNG (N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine), an increase in Ca²⁺ concentration or post-translational modifications (PTMs) of PARP1 (for example, phosphorylation, acetylation and poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation)). In MNNG-induced parthanatos, PARP1 hyperactivation causes the accumulation of PAR polymers, which are redistributed to the cytosol and to the mitochondria. In the cytosol these activate calpains, which cleave apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) at the inner mitochondrial membrane to release the active truncated form (tAIF) into the cytoplasm. PAR polymers can also directly induce AIF release from the outer mitochondrial membrane. It is unknown how tAIF induces regulated necrosis, but an undefined endonuclease seems to cleave DNA to induce PARP1 activation in a positive feedback loop. PAR polymers also PARylate several proteins, which leads to the depletion of NAD⁺ and, consequently, ATP. PARP1 inhibitors such as PJ-34 or 3-AB (3-aminobenzamide) prevent PARylation. Question marks indicate unknown pathways or proteins. DFO, deferoxamine; ER, endoplasmic reticulum; Pi, inorganic phosphate.

CYPD-dependent regulated necrosis. Mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT) is characterized by the opening of an outer mitochondrial membrane–inner mitochondrial membrane-spanning channel that is permeable to solutes of 1,500 Da or lower<sup>85</sup>. The molecular composition of the MPT pore (MPTP) is elusive, probably because the MPTP is a highly dynamic entity with a large interactome<sup>86</sup>. One crucial regulator of the MPTP is CYPD<sup>87</sup>, which promotes the opening of this channel and is inhibited by cyclosporin A or sanglifehrin A, two drugs with potent immunosuppressive properties and protective effects on IRI<sup>88</sup>. CYPD interacts with the adjacent adenine-nucleotide transporters on its matrix-exposed domain<sup>89</sup> as well as with the lateral stalk of the F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase<sup>90,91</sup> (FIG. 3c). The fact that CYPD mediates the opening of the MPTP, presumably leading to the translocation of NAD<sup>+</sup> from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol, has been concluded from the finding that mitochondria isolated from CYPD-null mice require twice the calcium load for MPTP opening compared with littermates<sup>87,92,93</sup>. Furthermore, CYPD-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts are protected from regulated necrosis that is induced by calcium release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)<sup>87</sup> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment<sup>92</sup>. CYPD seems to be crucial for MPTP-induced cytotoxicity, as deficiency in CYPD, but not voltage-dependent anion channels or adenine-nucleotide transporters<sup>87,94</sup>, exerts neuro-, cardio- and renoprotective effects in mice subjected to ischaemic injury<sup>87,89,92,95</sup>. Preventing the MPTP from opening by pharmacologically inhibiting CYPD might provide a certain degree of protection to patients following myocardial infarction<sup>96</sup>. Thus, CYPD-mediated regulated necrosis is typically observed in the context of IRI-linked pathologies.

Despite these documented protective effects, the inducers of MPT are still poorly characterized but seem to involve activation by ions (including phosphates, H<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup>), ROS, adenine nucleotides, ubiquitones and other factors<sup>86</sup>. Recently, p53 was proposed to regulate MPT-mediated necrosis<sup>97,98</sup>, although the precise mechanism is still under debate<sup>99</sup>. Future work is needed to clarify the importance of MPT in regulated necrosis beyond IRI-linked pathologies. Phenotypic characterization of mice deficient in both CYPD and another emerging factor that induces regulated necrosis could clarify the potential overlap with other regulated necrosis pathways. Recent data have indicated an additive protective effect for mice that are deficient in both CYPD and RIPK3 in renal IRI, an effect that is largely phenocopied by the combined application of NEC1 and sanglifehrin A<sup>100</sup>. These data point to a clear separation of necroptosis from CYPD-mediated regulated necrosis, but emphasize the therapeutic potential of targeting different pathways of regulated necrosis simultaneously in a setting of IRI-linked pathologies.

Parthanatos. Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) proteins are ADP-ribosyl transferase enzymes that transfer ADP-ribose groups from NAD<sup>+</sup> to their targets. By causing poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation (PARylation) of target proteins, PARPs control a wide array of cellular processes<sup>101</sup>. Typically, PARPs such as PARP1 can be activated by DNA breaks induced by ultraviolet light, ROS or alkylating agents<sup>102</sup>, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling pathway or posttranslational modifications such as phosphorylation, acetylation or ADP ribosylation<sup>103</sup> (FIG. 3d). Although PARP activation restores cellular homeostasis, overactivation of PARP1 results in regulated necrosis that has been named parthanatos<sup>104</sup>. Although PARP1 is proteolytically inactivated during apoptosis<sup>105</sup>, it seems to be activated in multiple pathways of regulated necrosis, in line with the observation that Parp1-knockout mice are resistant to multiple regulated necrosis-linked pathologies<sup>103,106</sup>. The PARylation of proteins is thought to deplete cells of NAD<sup>+</sup> (and consequently ATP) to cause regulated necrosis, and PAR polymers also induce the release of active, truncated apoptosis-inducing factor (tAIF) from the outer mitochondrial membrane, although it is unknown how tAIF induces regulated necrosis<sup>103,107</sup>. PARP inhibitors are in clinical trials to treat cancer by increasing cell death through blocking DNA repair in combination with chemotherapeutic agents<sup>108</sup>. Multiple lines of preclinical evidence suggest that PARP inhibition may also be suitable for the treatment of vascular or neurodegenerative injuries<sup>109</sup>.

The mutual linkage or overlap between parthanatos and necroptosis or CYPD-mediated regulated necrosis remains elusive. A role for PARP1 activation in the initiation of TNF signalling was initially observed in L929 fibrosarcoma cells<sup>105</sup>, and it was later shown to have a role in promoting TRAIL (TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced necroptosis downstream of RIPK1 and RIPK3 (REF. 110).

However, inhibition of PARP function did not affect TNF-induced necroptosis in Jurkat and 3T3 cells<sup>18</sup>. Conversely, the addition of NEC1, or the depletion of RIPK3, failed to block PARP1 activation and cell death induced by MNNG (N-methyl-N′-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine)<sup>111,112</sup>. Phenotyping PARP1-deficient mice and mice that are deficient in both RIPK3 and PARP1 in response to TNF or DNA damaging agents could help to sharpen our view on the interaction between both modes of regulated necrosis.

Pyroptosis and pyronecrosis. The term pyroptosis was introduced to describe the atypical death of macrophages infected with *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium<sup>113</sup>, but this type of cell death is not restricted to bacterial infections<sup>114</sup>. Pyroptosis is thought to result from osmotic pressure generated by the caspase 1-dependent formation of plasma membrane pores that dissipate cellular ionic gradients, and it is characterized by the rapid release of cytosolic contents<sup>115</sup>. A unique feature is the caspase 1-dependent active release of IL-1β and IL-18 from cells, which causes inflammation and fever<sup>116</sup> (FIG. 4a).

Interestingly, in many cases, the innate restriction of bacterial replication is independent of IL-1β and IL-18 (REFS 117–119). Therefore, pyroptosis might eliminate the niche exploited by intracellular pathogens for replication<sup>120,121</sup>. A crucial role for caspase 1 in pyroptosis was deduced from the use of caspase 1-deficient mice, which do not undergo pyroptosis. However, as these mice have recently been shown to also carry an inactivating passenger mutation in the gene encoding caspase 11 (REF. 122), these conclusions need to be revisited. This is especially important given that caspase 11 (often called caspase 4 for its human orthologue) is also involved in pyroptosis<sup>122,123</sup>, innate immunity against cytosolic bacteria<sup>123–125</sup> and increasing caspase 1 activation during infection with Gram-negative bacteria<sup>126</sup>, which illustrates that both caspase 1 and caspase 11 can initiate pyroptosis. Thus, pyroptosis and NETosis are typically observed in macrophages and neutrophils, respectively, and are part of the antibacterial innate immune defence mechanism. Recently, the *in vivo* relevance of pyroptosis has further been underlined by the demonstration that CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells die by pyroptosis upon infection with HIV<sup>186</sup>.

In addition to pyroptosis, another necrosis-like cell death process named pyronecrosis has been described in

Figure 4 | Regulated necrosis mediated by inflammasomes. a | Caspase 1 is typically activated in inflammasome complexes upon exposure to microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), pore-forming toxins, uric acid crystals, ultraviolet B (UVB) irradiation or cell death-associated molecular patterns (CDAMPs). Subsequently, caspase 1 activates its two major substrates (interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and IL-18) by cleavage to allow their cellular release and induces DNA fragmentation (through a still unknown mechanism) and osmotic swelling, which results in cell membrane rupture (pyroptosis). Pyroptosis is therefore considered to be the prototype of a highly pro-inflammatory form of regulated necrosis. Caspase 11 is also involved in pyroptosis [122,123], innate immunity against cytosolic bacteria [123,124] and increasing caspase 1 activation during infection with Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli, Citrobacter rodentium, Vibrio cholerae and Legionella pneumophila) [126]. Pyroptosis can be inhibited by chemical caspase inhibitors such as VX-740 or with virus-derived proteins such as cytokine response modifier A (CrmA). b | Another necrosis-like cell death process, pyronecrosis, has been described in response to Shigella flexneri, Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Toxoplasma gondii parasitophorous, Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin and Staphylococcus aureus.

response to Shigella flexneri. Pyronecrosis is independent of caspase 1 and caspase 11, but dependent on the inflammasome-component ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and the lysosomal protein CTSB (cathepsin B), and results in the secretion of the pro-inflammatory mediator HMGB1 (high mobility group box 1) from cells [127] (FIG. 4b). Later, Neisseria gonorrhoeae [128], Toxoplasma gondii parasitophorous [129], Bacillus anthracis lethal toxin [130] and Staphylococcus aureus [131] were reported to induce cell death that might be interpreted as pyronecrosis. Systematic studies using conditional knockout models will help to clarify the relative contribution of inflammatory caspases, RIPK1, RIPK3 and CTSB in response to different pathogen-associated molecular patterns in these types of regulated necrosis.

Connections between pathways  
As described above, it has been proposed that regulated necrosis can be induced by several molecular pathways. The key question is whether these individual pathways are part of an interacting network that impinges on common execution mechanisms to result in a similar morphology, or whether multiple programmes of regulated necrosis have evolved separately in relation to specific stimuli resulting from processes such as infection and cellular stress. We consider the recurring mechanisms that occur downstream in the pathways of regulated necrosis (FIG. 1, level 2 and level 3) and how these are connected with upstream activators. The evidence suggests that common executioner mechanisms were selected during evolution. The common mechanisms involve redox metabolism and bioenergetics that impinge on physicochemical processes that regulate osmotic swelling, the loss of plasma and lysosomal and mitochondrial membrane integrity.

Role of ATP- and NAD⁺-depleting pathways. In addition to ATP, pyridine nucleotides such as NAD⁺ are energy intermediates that act as signal transducers, in particular in regulated necrosis [132]. Loss of NAD⁺ is one of the most detrimental outcomes of MPT [133], as NAD⁺ is an essential cofactor in most enzymatic reactions that support mitochondrial function. In the absence of NAD⁺, such reactions actively consume ATP in an attempt to maintain electrochemical gradients across the inner mitochondrial membrane [133]. This breaks down the cellular bioenergetic equilibrium and eventually results in regulated necrosis. A prominent

role for NAD⁺ catabolism in cell death mechanisms is supported by the observation that *in vivo* models of brain ischaemia, epilepsy and Alzheimer’s disease exhibit a decrease in total cellular NAD⁺ levels before neuronal cell death¹³³,¹³⁴. The consumption of NAD⁺ due to the overactivation of PARP1 (FIG. 3d) was proposed to block glycolysis, resulting in metabolic breakdown. This effect was increased by ATP consumption resulting from ATP-dependent NAD⁺ synthesis¹⁰⁷. Thus, NAD⁺ depletion is a central mediator of regulated necrosis, at least in response to IRI and DNA damage. Considering that other emerging forms of regulated necrosis also affect the cellular redox metabolome (BOX 2), it is tempting to speculate that this dysregulation is also causally linked to the progression of regulated necrosis. As bioenergetics are crucial for cellular functioning, imbalances may be sensed by the basic processes that regulate membrane integrity.

**Role of Ca²⁺ in regulated necrosis.** In neurons, overactivation of Glu receptors allows high Ca²⁺ influx, followed by a second influx of Ca²⁺ from the ER and/or the extracellular space, which leads to regulated necrosis¹³⁵ (FIG. 3a). Mitochondrial Ca²⁺ overload and subsequent MPT triggers regulated necrosis⁸⁷,⁹²,⁹³. In primates, excessive Ca²⁺ levels resulting from ischaemia induce the calpain-mediated release of cathepsin from lysosomes, which, in turn, leads to regulated necrosis⁶⁹,¹³⁶. In addition to contributing to LMP, calpains cleave the plasma membrane Na⁺/Ca²⁺ antiporter during brain ischaemia, and their inhibition could prevent Ca²⁺ overload and rescue neurons from excitotoxic death¹³⁷. Finally, the pharmacological inhibitor dantrolene, which prevents Ca²⁺ release from the ER, was previously shown to be protective in a series of *in vivo* models, many of which have been associated with necroptosis. These include cerulein-induced pancreatitis¹³⁸, hypoxic neurons¹³⁹,¹⁴⁰, a transgenic mouse model of Huntington’s disease¹⁴¹, IRI¹⁴²,¹⁴³ and heatstroke-induced regulated necrosis in C. elegans¹⁴⁴.

**Box 2 | Cellular redox metabolome signalling in regulated necrosis**

Glycogenolysis, glycolysis and glutaminolysis are increased in necroptosis following receptor-interacting protein kinase 3 (RIPK3) activation¹², which consequently results in increased NADH production (see the figure). This might put pressure on the electron transport chain (ETC), and in particular on NADH dehydrogenase (mitochondrial complex I of ETC), resulting in enhanced reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Other emerging modes of regulated necrosis also seem to affect the cellular redox metabolome. Indeed, parthanatos and cyclophilin D (CYPD)-mediated regulated necrosis result in a decrease in NAD⁺ and ATP levels. Ferroptosis, NETosis, pyroptosis and necroptosis result in NADPH consumption due to NADPH oxidase (NOX) activation. Both ferroptosis and oxytosis result in decreased levels of glutathione (GSH) owing to inhibition of the system X⁻Cys/Glu antiporter. Interestingly, these redox couples are all interlinked: for example, NADH and NADPH are interconverted by the nicotinamide nucleotide transhydrogenase, GSSG (oxidized glutathione disulphide) is reduced using NADPH by the GSH reductase, and GSSG is formed by glutathione peroxidase as a result of scavenging H₂O₂. Finally, the dysregulation of the redox metabolome results in reduced antioxidant activity, enhanced ROS production and lipid peroxidation, energetic catastrophe and regulated necrosis.

regulated necrosis²³. On the basis of live cell imaging that illustrates the occurrence of LMP in different cell death modalities⁶⁵ and the recurring role of lysosomal biogenesis in regulated necrosis in several model organisms⁴⁵,¹⁴⁵,¹⁴⁶, we consider LMP as a proteolytic amplifier that contributes to the final executioner phase of regulated necrosis (FIG. 1). Nevertheless, some reports point towards an initiator role for LMP in regulated necrosis: for example, in response to lysotrophic agents¹⁴⁷, oxidative stress⁶⁵ or toxins such as cobra venom¹⁴⁸, algal yessotoxin¹⁴⁹ and B. anthracis lethal toxin¹³⁰. Recently it was found that, during involution, lysosomes in the mammary epithelium undergo

To understand the complexity of life and death, scientists try to simplify their observations in models and label them with neologisms. Unfortunately, this approach is prone to data misinterpretation, and often these labels are superseded by more recent

discoveries. This is illustrated by a retrospective view of the definition of necroptosis. In 2005, necroptosis was defined as regulated necrosis induced by TNF when caspases are inhibited¹⁸. In 2008, this process was redefined as being dependent on RIPK1 kinase activity¹⁶, but immediately challenged by the finding that the kinase activity of RIPK1 also contributes to apoptosis in particular conditions⁵³, undermining the restrictive biochemical definition. In 2009, the concerted action between RIPK1 and RIPK3 (as part of the necrosome) was proposed¹¹. Later on, RIPK3 was classified as the major initiator of necroptosis, as it can trigger it independently of RIPK1 (REFS 12, 151, 152). In 2012, MLKL was proposed as the crucial mediator of necroptosis downstream of RIPK3 (REFS 10, 31). Now, it has been reported that RIPK3 and MLKL may also trigger inflammasome activation in epithelial and monocytic cells, even in a cell death-independent manner⁶⁰,¹⁵³. Hence, the pharmacological inhibition of RIPK1 activity or the use of RIPK3- or MLKL-deficient mice is not sufficient to prove that necroptosis is causative for a given phenotype. Another example that illustrates the difficulty of classifying distinct cell death processes is the phenomenon of ‘autoschizis’¹⁵⁴, a necrotic cell death process characterized by membrane damage, progressive loss of cytoplasm, nuclear fragmentation, karyolysis and formation of cellular fragments. Autoschizis shares features of both apoptosis (blebbing-like morphology, nuclear fragmentation and DNA degradation) and necrosis (ROS-mediated lipid peroxidation, involvement of cathepsins and plasma membrane permeabilization), and it has been distinguished form the ‘standard’ form of apoptosis or necrosis¹⁵⁵. Similarly, autophagy-inducing peptides, such as Tat (transactivating transcriptional activator)—Beclin 1, were shown to induce autophagy-dependent cell death named ‘autosis’, which is characterized by the rapid shrinkage of the nucleus with a portion of its surface becoming concave, followed by focal plasma membrane rupture and extracellular extrusion of the cytoplasmic contents¹⁵⁶. This exemplifies the difficulty of labelling cell death processes before they have been fully characterized, and underscores the need to also study the relative contribution of emerging mechanisms of regulated necrosis as well as necroptosis. Moreover, exploring in more detail the contribution of common mediator and executioner mechanisms in differently induced forms of regulated necrosis could validate, challenge and integrate our current view of the different modes of regulated necrosis.

Assuming that the diversity or redundancy in the molecular mechanisms of regulated necrosis is higher at the trigger and initiation levels than at mediator and execution levels (FIG. 1) would imply that regulated necrosis can be inhibited more efficiently downstream. This is exemplified by the need to inhibit both RIPK1 and CYPD, and thus parallel pathways of regulated necrosis, to protect against renal IRI¹⁰⁰, whereas compounds interfering with downstream nodes such as LMP (for example, metal protein-attenuating compounds) or Ca²⁺ signalling (for example, dantrolene) have more potential as a single treatment⁴⁵,¹³⁸–¹⁴⁴. This model suggests three major lines for future research. First, we should experimentally challenge the current convergent nodes in regulated necrosis and try to identify new ones. Second, the contribution of the emerging forms of regulated necrosis must be clearly ascribed and linked to each pathophysiological model, because varying the pathophysiological conditions or cell types involved may result in different forms of regulated necrosis. Third, new inhibitors targeting the emerging forms of regulated necrosis and their convergent downstream signalling nodes should be identified. Other future challenges will include unravelling common cellular disintegration mechanisms in regulated necrosis, studying how regulated necrosis connects to other biological processes, such as immunological responses and regeneration processes, identifying defined biomarkers for selected regulated necrosis pathways, and, most importantly, understanding the contribution of regulated necrosis pathways, and the relationship between them, to cell death-associated diseases.

Finally, we would like to convey the following ‘take-home’ message: scientists studying the contribution of regulated necrosis in inflammatory and degenerative diseases should take into account the vast knowledge that has been built up on forms of regulated necrosis beyond necroptosis. In the past, the cell death research community has been largely biased towards apoptosis, and consequently apoptosis was supposedly observed everywhere and therefore thought to be responsible for many physiological and pathophysiological situations. However, as we now realize, regulated necrosis may actually be the more prominent mode of cell death, but we should avoid narrowing down regulated necrosis to necroptosis — life and death love variation, redundancy and pleiotropy.
