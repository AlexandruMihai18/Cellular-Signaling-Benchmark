Ubiquitination of the CSF3R [CSF3 (colony-stimulating factor 3) receptor] occurs after activated CSF3Rs are internalized and reside in early endosomes. CSF3R ubiquitination is crucial for lysosomal routing and degradation. The E3 ligase SOCS 3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3) has been shown to play a major role in this process. Deubiquitinating enzymes remove ubiquitin moieties from target proteins by proteolytic cleavage. Two of these enzymes, AMSH [associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM (signal transducing adaptor molecule)] and UBPY (ubiquitin isopeptidase Y), interact with the general endosomal sorting machinery. Whether deubiquitinating enzymes control CSF3R trafficking from early towards late endosomes is unknown. In the present study, we asked whether AMSH, UBPY or a murine family of deubiquitinating enzymes could fulfil such a role. This DUB family (deubiquitin enzyme family) comprises four members (DUB1, DUB1A, DUB2 and DUB2A),

which were originally described as being haematopoietic-specific and cytokine-inducible, but their function in cytokine receptor routing and signalling has remained largely unknown. We show that DUB2A expression is induced by CSF3 in myeloid 32D cells and that DUB2 decreases ubiquitination and lysosomal degradation of the CSF3R, leading to prolonged signalling. These results support a model in which CSF3R ubiquitination is dynamically controlled at the early endosome by feedback mechanisms involving CSF3-induced E3 ligase (SOCS 3) and deubiquitinase (DUB2A) activities.

Key words: endocytosis, deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor 3 (CSF3) receptor, signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 5, suppressor of cytokine signalling (SOCS) 3.

### INTRODUCTION

To control the duration of signalling, many activated growth-factor receptors are subject to ligand-induced endocytosis and intracellular routing to early endosomes and lysosomes, where the receptor proteins are degraded [1]. Ubiquitination is the major protein modification involved in this process [1, 2]. CSF3 (colony-stimulating factor 3) stimulates myeloid cell proliferation and differentiation [3]. CSF3 activates the latent transcription factor STAT (signal transducer and activator of transcription) 3, which induces the expression of SOCS3 encoding the SOCS 3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3) protein [4, 5]. SOCS 3 is recruited to a phosphorylated tyrosine (Tyr⁷²⁹) motif in the activated CSF3R (CSF3 receptor) [4] and forms an E3 ligase complex via its SOCS box [6]. It has been shown that SOCS 3, by ubiquitination of a juxtamembrane lysine residue in the CSF3R cytoplasmic domain, promotes CSF3R routing from early to late endosomes, leading to signal termination [7].

Deubiquitinating enzymes remove Ub (ubiquitin) from their target substrates and are therefore potentially important in controlling receptor routing and signalling. Two endosomal deubiquitinating enzymes associated with routing of activated receptors are STAMBPA [STAM (signal transducing adaptor molecule)-binding protein], also known as AMSH (associated molecule with the SH3 domain of STAM), a member of the JAMM

(JAB1/MPN/mov34-domain-containing) family and USP (Ub-specific peptidase) 8, which is also known as UBPY (Ub isopeptidase Y), a member of the USP family of deubiquitinating enzymes [8, 9]. Both bind to the ESCRT (endosomal sorting complex required for transport)-0 subunit STAM1 via their SH3 domain and to ESCRT-III through their MIT (microtubule-interacting and transport) domains [10–13]. AMSH is involved in endosomal trafficking of tyrosine kinase receptors such as the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) and G-protein-coupled receptor-like PAR₂ (protease-activated receptor 2), DOR (δ-opioid peptide receptor) and CXCR4 [8, 14–17]. UBPY has been shown to be important in stabilizing the ESCRT-0 complex [18–20] and is essential for deubiquitination and degradation of EGFR, PAR₂ and DOR [14, 15, 21]. UBPY has been proposed to maintain the pool of free Ub by releasing it from the cargo just prior to lysosomal degradation [22].

The murine DUB family (deubiquitin enzyme family) comprises four highly homologous USP proteins (DUB1, DUB1A, DUB2 and DUB2A) that were initially identified in haematopoietic cells [23–25]. Their sequence similarity and location on chromosome 7 suggest that they have arisen from a tandem duplication event [24, 25]. All four DUBs are rapidly and transiently induced in response to various cytokines [23–26]. For instance, DUB1 expression is induced by IL (interleukin)-3, IL-5 and CSF2, cytokines that activate

receptors with a β common subunit, resulting in a G1 phase
cell-cycle arrest [25, 27]. For IL-3-induced up-regulation of
DUB1, a critical role for JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) and the
Ras/Raf/MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) pathway was
shown [28]. However, these pathways appeared necessary, but
not sufficient, because JAK2 and MAPK activation by the
EPOR (erythropoietin receptor) did not result in increased DUB1
expression [28, 29]. DUB1A is IL-3-inducible in B-lymphocytes,
whereas DUB2 is induced by IL-2 in T-cells [26]. DUB2
inhibits apoptosis after IL-2 withdrawal and prolongs STAT5
phosphorylation in Ba/F3 cells expressing IL2Rβ (IL-2 receptor
β) [24, 30]. The DUB2A enhancer element contains one Ets and
two AP-1 (activator protein 1)-binding sites that are required
for DUB2A expression in T-lymphocytes [31]. Finally, DUB1
controls ubiquitination of the dynein heavy chain, which is part
of the complex that regulates the movement of cargo along
microtubules [32]. Taken together, these findings suggest that
DUBs may modulate a variety of processes at distinct intracellular
locations, including endosomal cargo trafficking and processing.
The first human family member found to be homologous with
the murine DUB family by database analysis was DUB3. DUB3
was subsequently shown to be IL-4- and IL-6-inducible, and
constitutive expression can block cell proliferation [33]. The
official name of DUB3 is now USP17L2. The human USP17
family is reported to be encoded within RS447, a megasatellite
repeat, on human chromosome 4 and on chromosome 8 embedded
within the copy-number-variable β-defensin cluster [34, 35]. The
multiple family members in different species have evolved
as the result of duplication of a common ancestral sequence,
which is in general replicated after the species diverged [35, 36].
Previously, we have shown that CSF3R ubiquitination,
predominantly taking place when the receptor resides in early
endosomes, triggers its routing towards late endosomes, followed
by lysosomal degradation [7]. In view of this negative-feedback
mechanism involving CSF3-induced SOCS3 expression followed
by lysosomal degradation, we asked whether deubiquitinating
enzymes acting on CSF3R at the early endosome may antagonize
this inhibitory feedback loop. In the present study, we show
that CSF3 induces DUB2A expression in myeloid progenitor
cells. Subsequently, DUB2A reduces CSF3R ubiquitination and
causes the accumulation of CSF3R in early endosomes, leading
to prolonged signalling. These results support a model in which
DUB2A acts in a positive-feedback loop to counterbalance
STAT3/SOCS3-driven lysosomal targeting of the CSF3R.

DUB2 cells expressing wt (wild-type) CSF3R were obtained by
retroviral transduction as described previously [38]. Ba/F3β/tTA

Dickinson).

Expression levels in 32D cells deprived of growth factors for 4 h were used as calibrators.

**Bio-CSF3 (biotinylated CSF3) pulldowns and CSF3-induced STAT5 phosphorylation**

CSF3R pulldown with Bio-CSF3 and subsequent SDS/PAGE and Western blotting analysis was performed as described previously [42,43]. Detection of proteins was performed using fluorescently labelled secondary antibodies and the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences). Quantification was performed using the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System software according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For off-rates, Ba/F3β/tTA DUB2 cells stably expressing wt CSF3R were grown in the presence or absence of Dox for 60 h. Subsequently, cells were cytokine- and serum-deprived followed by stimulation with CSF3 for 10 min. CSF3 was then washed away and cells were incubated at 37°C in RPMI 1640 medium for the time points indicated.

**Confocal microscopy**

Lysosomal routing of activated membrane CSF3Rs was visualized by CLSM (confocal laser-scanning microscopy) using a Leica SP5 instrument as described previously [7]. In brief, HeLa cells stably expressing wt CSF3R constructs were transfected with different DUB constructs. After 48 h, cells were incubated with anti-CSF3R antibody and CSF3 for 10 min at room temperature (25°C), washed twice and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with saponin, fixed with 3 % paraformaldehyde and stained for internalized receptors (DaM-cy5) or EEA1 (DaG-488 or RaG-546) in combination with or without staining for DUB2 (DaR-cy3).

**RESULTS**

**CSF3 induces *Dub2A* expression**

To determine whether expression of DUB family members is induced by CSF3, we used myeloid 32D cells expressing human CSF3R. Cells were deprived of serum and IL-3 for 4 h, followed by CSF3 stimulation for the time points indicated. *Dub* mRNA expression increased, with maximal levels at 60 min of CSF3 stimulation (Figure 1A). Nucleotide sequencing identified *Dub2A* as the single member being induced by CSF3. Because DUB2A is highly homologous with DUB2 (97 % identical amino acid sequence), DUB2A was readily detected using an anti-DUB2 antibody 1–3 h after initiation of CSF3 stimulation (Figure 1C). In contrast, *Ubpy* and *Amsh* expression was not induced by CSF3 (Figure 1A). *Socs3* transcript levels, which were assessed in parallel, were maximal at 30 min of CSF3 stimulation (Figure 1B).

To confirm the presence of different deubiquitinating enzymes, the total cell lysate (TCL) blot was stained using anti-GFP and anti-DUB2 antibodies. The TCL blot was also stained for actin as a loading control. (B) Quantification of three experiments carried out as shown in (A).

### Dub2A induction requires JAK activity

Previous studies have shown that activation of JAK2 and the Ras/Raf/MAPK pathway is important for IL-3-dependent *Dub1* induction [28]. To assess which signalling pathways are vital for CSF3-induced *Dub2A* expression, we first focused on the signalling mechanisms coupled to the CSF3R tyrosine residues by using a tyrosine-less mutant (m0) and single tyrosine add-back CSF3R mutants (mA, mB, mC and mD) containing Tyr⁷⁰⁴, Tyr⁷²⁹, Tyr⁷⁴⁴ and Tyr⁷⁶⁴ respectively (Figure 1D). The presence of STAT3-docking sites Tyr⁷⁰⁴ or Tyr⁷⁴⁴ (mA and mC) resulted in an approx. 1.5-fold higher and a prolonged induction of *Dub2A* relative to m0. The presence of a SOCS3 recruitment site Tyr⁷²⁹ (mB) decreased the induction of *Dub2A* expression approx. 2-fold compared with m0. The presence of Tyr⁷⁶⁴ (mD), involved in the activation of the Ras/Raf/ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase) pathway [37], resulted in only a moderate (1.5-fold) increase of *Dub2A* expression, suggesting that, in contrast with IL-3-induced expression of *Dub1*, ERK is not essential for CSF3-induced *Dub2A* expression (Figure 1D). To further investigate which signalling pathways might be involved in this process, we used a panel of chemical inhibitors, including the MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase) inhibitor U0126, an Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor PP2, an Akt inhibitor IV, the p38 MAPK inhibitor SB203580, the JAK inhibitor I, the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) inhibitor LY294002 and a JNK inhibitor VIII. The JAK inhibitor I completely, and the MEK inhibitor U0126 partly,

abolished *Dub2A* up-regulation. None of the other compounds showed significant inhibitory effects (Figure 1E).

### DUB2 reduces ubiquitination and enhances protein stability of activated CSF3R in the retrograde pathway

Next, we asked whether DUB2 affects the CSF3R ubiquitination status and whether this has an impact on CSF3R degradation. Ectopic expression of DUB2 reduced ubiquitination levels of activated wt CSF3Rs (Figures 2A and 2B). The CSF3R mutant K5R, which lacks all cytoplasmic lysine residues and consequently escapes lysosomal degradation [7], was taken as a relative measure of CSF3R protein stability. Importantly, although the expression of UBPY, AMSH and DUB2 all resulted in reduced CSF3R ubiquitination levels, only DUB2 increased the stability of the wt CSF3R, comparable with the levels of K5R (Figure 2A). In contrast, ectopic expression of AMSH led to increased degradation of the CSF3R, whereas UBPY did not influence CSF3R stability (Figures 2A and 2B).

### DUB2 does not affect total levels of non-activated CSF3R

Subsequently, we wondered whether DUBs also influence steady-state CSF3R levels. Expression of DUB2 did not elevate the total CSF3R pool, implicating that DUB2-mediated deubiquitination and increased protein stability is specifically associated with

the retrograde endocytic pathway (Figure 2C). Strikingly, expression of AMSH resulted in increased degradation of the total pool of CSF3R, suggesting that AMSH exerts a negative role in CSF3R processing in the biosynthetic pathway. On the other hand UBPY, like DUB2, did not affect total CSF3R levels.

DUB2 promotes retention of activated CSF3R in early endosomes

Previously, we have shown that ubiquitination of CSF3R is not required for CSF3R internalization, but that ubiquitination of a juxtamembrane lysine residue (Lys⁶³²) is crucial for CSF3R

Ba/F3β/tTA DUB2 cells stably expressing wt CSF3R were grown in the presence or absence of dox for 60 h. (A) Cells were cytokine- and serum-deprived for 4 h, and stimulated for 10 min with CSF3 at 37°C. The CSF3 was washed away and cells were kept in medium without factor at 37°C for the time points indicated. Down-regulation of STAT5 phosphorylation was monitored using Western blot analysis. The blot was stained for total STAT5 as a loading control. (B) Quantification of three experiments carried out as shown in (A). The mean amounts of phosphorylated STAT5 were normalized to total levels and expressed as a percentage of maximum phosphorylated STAT5 activation ± S.E.M. (C) Cells were pre-incubated with the lysosomal inhibitor bafilomycin and stimulated with Bio-CSF3 for the time periods indicated. CSF3R was precipitated using streptavidin beads and analysed by Western blotting for CSF3R and endogenous Ub using the P4D1 antibody.

(D) Quantification of three independent experiments carried out as shown in (B). The mean amounts of Ub in the CSF3R immunoprecipitates were normalized to total receptor levels and expressed as a percentage ± S.D. of ubiquitination status of wt CSF3R after 60 min of Bio-CSF3 stimulation in the absence of DUB2 (set at 100 %).

routing from early endosomes towards late endosomes and lysosomes, thereby causing the degradation of the activated CSF3R [7,43]. Because DUB2 enhances CSF3R protein stability we asked whether DUB2 directly interferes with lysosomal routing by controlling the ubiquitination status of Lys⁶³². To this end, we employed a mutant, mKA, that retains Lys⁶³² but lacks the other conserved cytoplasmic lysine residues [7]. DUB2 clearly increased the stability of the mKA CSF3R, providing additional evidence for a role of DUB2 in counteracting lysosomal degradation of CSF3R (Figures 3A and 3B) and further supporting the crucial involvement of Lys⁶³² and its ubiquitination status in balancing this process.

Next, we studied the effects of DUB2 on the routing dynamics of CSF3R by confocal microscopy. At low endogenous DUB levels, ligand-activated CSF3Rs resided in lysosomes 2 h after CSF3 stimulation and were no longer detectable in early endosomes (Figure 3C, top row). In contrast, in cells in which DUB2 was ectopically expressed, CSF3R accumulated in early endosomes 2 h post-CSF3 stimulation (Figure 3C, second row). Notably, ectopic expression of UBPY or AMSH did not result in increased accumulation of CSF3R in the early endosome compartment, clearly suggesting that these enzymes deubiquitinate CSF3R at a different stage in the retrograde pathway (Figure 3C, third and fourth rows).

### DUB2 prolongs CSF3-induced STAT5 phosphorylation

Accumulation of lysine-deficient mutants of CSF3R in early endosomes causes sustained activation of STAT5 upon removal of CSF3 [7]. To investigate whether up-regulation of DUB2 has a similar effect on STAT5 activation, Ba/F3β/tTA-DUB2 cells stably expressing wt CSF3R were cultured for 60 h with Dox to inhibit and without Dox to induce DUB2 expression. Expression of DUB2 resulted in prolonged STAT5 phosphorylation after CSF3 withdrawal (Figures 4A and 4B). Pulldown experiments with Bio-CSF3 showed that this was associated with reduced ubiquitination of the CSF3R (Figures 4C and 4D).

### DISCUSSION

We have identified the USP family member DUB2A as a major negative regulator of CSF3R ubiquitination, thereby controlling intracellular routing and signalling properties of CSF3R. Among the four homologous members of the murine DUB family, only DUB2A was specifically up-regulated in myeloid cells in response to CSF3 stimulation. DUB2A reduced the ubiquitination of the juxtamembrane residue Lys⁶³², which was previously shown to be a target for ubiquitination by the E3 ligase SOCS3 [7].

It is currently unknown why DUB2A, but not other family members, is specifically up-regulated in myeloid cells and which signalling pathways and transcriptional regulators are important

Figure 5 Model of SOCS3- and DUB2A-controlled CSF3R routing and signal termination

Following CSF3 stimulation, STAT3 is activated which induces SOCS3. SOCS3 is subsequently recruited to Tyr<sup>729</sup> of the CSF3R and forms an E3 ligase complex via its SOCS box which ubiquitinates Lys<sup>632</sup> of the CSF3R (negative-feedback loop). This causes CSF3R routing from early endosomes to lysosomes where the receptor is degraded. DUB2A is in addition up-regulated by CSF3 via an unknown mechanism which involves activation of JAKs. DUB2A deubiquitinates Lys<sup>632</sup> of the CSF3R, thereby counteracting the SOCS3 ligase complex and inhibiting lysosomal routing (positive-feedback loop). K, lysine; Y, tyrosine.

for its expression. Sequence alignment of the 5′ transcription enhancer domains of *Dub1* and *Dub2A* showed that these regions contain comparable transcription factor binding sites, including GATA, Ets, AP-1 and CBF (CCAAT-binding factor 1) sites [23]. Potentially, differential accessibility of promoter/enhancer regions, e.g. due to chromatin structure, could explain why only *Dub2A* and not *Dub1*, *Dub1A* or *Dub2* is transcribed in myeloid 32D cells in response to CSF3, but this needs further study. Concerning the signalling mechanisms involved, it became clear that activation of JAKs is crucial for CSF3-induced *Dub2A* expression. In contrast, no evidence for a major involvement of other signalling pathways activated by CSF3, e.g. Ras/Raf/MEK1, PI3K/Akt, p38 MAPK or JNK pathways was obtained, either by applying specific inhibitors or from experiments with selective tyrosine mutants of CSF3R known to play a major role in the activation of STAT3 or MAPKs [37,39,40,44].

Although DUB2, UBPY and AMSH all reduced ubiquitination of activated CSF3Rs, only DUB2 enhanced the stability of the CSF3R, through promoting its accumulation in early endosomes. For UBPY, this fits well with its proposed function to retrieve ubiquitin from targeted receptors before they go into multivesicular bodies [45]. In the literature, there are opposing reports regarding the role of AMSH in EGFR degradation. Whereas one study shows that AMSH is important for EGFR degradation after retrograde transport [16], another demonstrates that AMSH silencing enhances EGFR degradation [8]. We showed that AMSH strongly diminishes the steady-state CSF3R levels independent of receptor activation and internalization. The finding that decreased receptor levels were pulled down with Bio-CSF3, might thus be entirely due to reduced membrane expression of CSF3R, rather than elevated degradation after retrograde transport. At this point we cannot discriminate whether DUB2 directly or indirectly reduces the ubiquitination of the CSF3R. DUB2 may deubiquitinate members of the endocytic machinery and thereby influence the routing and the ubiquitination status of the CSF3R. This is not without precedent because it is known that DUB1 deubiquitinates dynein heavy chain [32]. The dynein heavy-chain family, which has two major classes of axonemal and cytoplasmic proteins, mainly associates with the microtubule complex and is involved in the regulation of the movement of organelles and vesicles along microtubules [46]. Dynein is known to be associated with the movement of late endosomes and also for receptor sorting and morphogenesis of early endosomes [47,48].

In conclusion, the results of the present study fit into a model in which ubiquitination of activated CSF3R is dynamically controlled by the E3 ligase activity of SOCS3, a direct target of STAT3 [44], and the Ub-specific protease activity of DUB2A (Figure 5). Given that receptor ubiquitination has been implicated in the endocytic routing of numerous membrane receptors involving a variety of E3 ligases [43,49–52], it is now worthwhile investigating whether and which DUBs are able to delay the lysosomal routing of different growth-factor-receptor systems. Conceivably, this will provide important insights into how these receptor activities are controlled under physiological conditions. Moreover, in view of the increasing association of Ub-mediated pathways with various pathological conditions, the role of DUBs in diseases linked with growth-factor-receptor dysfunction deserves further study.
