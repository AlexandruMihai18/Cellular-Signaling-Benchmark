Mammalian peptide transporters as targets for drug delivery

Isabel Rubio-Aliaga and Hannelore Daniel

Peptide transporters are integral plasma membrane proteins that mediate the cellular uptake of dipeptides and tripeptides in addition to a variety of peptidomimetics. The carriers, which occur predominantly in the brush-border membranes of epithelial cells of the small intestine, lung, choroid plexus and kidney, contribute to absorption, distribution and elimination of their substrates. The cellular uptake of peptides and peptidomimetics involves the cotransport of protons down an inwardly directed, electrochemical proton gradient that provides the driving force and causes the electronegativity of the translocation step. Peptide transporters represent excellent targets for the delivery of pharmacologically active compounds because their substrate-binding site can accommodate a wide range of molecules of differing size, hydrophobicity and charge.

Two peptide transporters, designated peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1, SLC15A1) and peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2, SLC15A2) [1–9], have been identified in mammals. Both are plasma membrane proteins with similar topology. They contain 12 predicted membrane-spanning domains (TMD) and N- and C-termini that face the cytosol (Fig. 1). In humans, PEPT1 has 708 amino acid residues whereas PEPT2 has 729 amino acid residues. The proteins are present predominantly in epithelial cells of the small intestine, mammary gland, lung, choroid plexus and kidney, but are also found in other cell types (Table 1). By coupling the movement of substrate across the membrane with the movement of protons down an inwardly directed, electrochemical proton gradient, PEPT1 and PEPT2 transport peptides against a concentration gradient. A unique feature is their capability for sequence-independent transport of all possible dipeptides and tripeptides, including differently charged species. These transporters are stereoselective, with peptides that contain L-enantiomers of amino acid residues having a higher affinity for binding and transport than peptides that contain one or more D-enantiomers. PEPT1 and PEPT2 also transport a variety of peptidomimetic compounds, such as classical β-lactam antibiotics and selected peptidase and protease inhibitors. Because peptide transporters in the plasma membrane can be used for drug delivery, in this review we focus on the structure of these transporters and the characteristics of substrates that are required for efficient transport.

Functional characteristics of peptide transport PEPT1 and PEPT2 were the first mammalian nutrient transporters to be identified that use an electrochemical proton gradient as their driving force [10]. In this mechanism, substrate uptake depends strongly on extracellular pH and membrane potential, and has a pH optimum of 4.5–6.5, depending on the net charge of the substrate. Because the microenvironment at brush border membranes is relatively stable and slightly acidic (pH ~6.5), uptake of peptides and peptidomimetics is optimal for compounds that have no net charge at this pH. Anionic and cationic substrates show shifted pH-dependencies for optimal transport and they have lower transport rates under physiological conditions. In all cases transport is electronegative and the rate of transport increases as the membrane potential hyperpolarizes. When active, peptide transporters act as cellular acid loaders. Thus, secondary effects on the transport systems that are involved in homeostasis of intracellular pH, such as Na⁺-H⁺ exchangers, increase the cellular uptake of Na⁺.

Dipeptides and tripeptides that are taken up into cells are rapidly hydrolyzed by cytosolic peptidases and the free amino acids generated are either used by the cells or released into circulation via multiple, basolateral, amino acid transporters (Fig. 2). Hydrolysis-resistant compounds, however, which include peptidomimetics in addition to hydrolysis-resistant peptides, are transported out of the cells by a basolateral peptide transporter that has not been identified molecularly. However, facilitative peptide transporters in the basolateral membrane from intestinal and kidney epithelial cells have been described functionally [11,12]. These transporters have characteristics similar to apical transporters and mediate the influx and efflux of dipeptides, tripeptides, peptide-like drugs and non-peptide compounds [11,13], but with a substantially lower substrate affinity than PEPT1 or PEPT2. Some of the drugs taken up by apical peptide transporters might also leave the cell by transporters of organic anions or cations. These might also be used by drugs released in the cells by the hydrolysis of prodrugs delivered to the cell via PEPT1 or PEPT2.

Although similar in function, PEPT1 and PEPT2 display major differences in substrate specificity and affinity, and transport capacity. PEPT1 can be considered as a low-affinity, high-capacity system [14] with apparent affinity constants (Kₘ values) ranging from 200 μM to 10 mM, depending on the substrate. Under identical experimental conditions, the affinity of PEPT2 is higher for most, but not all, substrates.

PEPT2 can be considered as a high-affinity, low-capacity transport system, with \( K_{\mathrm{m}} \) values of 5–500 μM, depending on the substrate.

The physiological substrates of PEPT1 and PEPT2 are dipeptides and tripeptides that consist mainly of the 20 proteinogenic L-α-amino acids, which adds up to 400 different dipeptides and 8000 possible tripeptides, not including peptides containing D-enantiomers of amino acids. Peptides that contain D-enantiomers at the N-terminal position have good affinities and are transported with high rates. Therefore, substrates of

PEPT1 and PEPT2 represent a huge variety of structures that have different physicochemical characteristics of molecular mass, charge and polarity. This is important when designing pharmacologically active compounds for delivery via these transporters because the substrate-binding sites provide some freedom to accommodate molecules that possess unusual structures and pharmacological activity.

Carrier-protein structure and function

To elucidate the structure-function relationships of PEPT1 and PEPT2, chimeric peptide transporters that consist of variable regions of PEPT1 and PEPT2 have been generated and site-directed mutagenesis has been applied. Functional analysis of recombinant chimeras indicates that the N-terminal region of the protein, up to TMD 9, is responsible for all the

phenotypic characteristics [15]. The first six TMDs contain the regions that determine pH dependence and form the major part of the substrate-binding pocket [16], whereas TMDs 7–9 have a role in defining substrate affinity [17]. These findings indicate that the N-terminal TMDs form a pore-like structure and that TMDs 7–9 (Fig. 1) form the substrate-binding pocket. A stretch of amino acids (residues 1–59) in the substrate-binding domain interferes with the side-chains of dipeptides and an area between TMDs 2 and 3 (residues 60–91) contributes significantly to the pH dependency of transport [18]. Mutagenesis studies have identified several residues that are either important or essential for function. His 57 (in TMD 2) appears to be involved in proton binding, with two nearby tyrosine residues (Y 56 and Y 64) stabilizing the charge [19]. His 121 is involved in substrate recognition, by facilitating neutralization of the charge of acidic peptides through protonation before translocation [19]. Other residues in TMDs 1, 3, 5 and 7 modulate substrate binding. Based on these findings a model for the interaction between substrate and amino acid residues in the binding pocket has been proposed [20].

Drugs and prodrugs that are substrates of peptide transporters

Antibiotics

Because of their effectiveness and generally low toxicity, the β-lactam family of antibiotics (penicillins and cephalosporins) includes many of the most commonly used antibacterials. The basic structure of these antibacterial agents resembles the backbone of a tripeptide with the C-terminal peptide bond incorporated into the rigid β-lactam ring. When the C-N bond of the β-lactam ring is rotated by 180°, the D-stereochemistry of the cephalosporins matches the L-stereochemistry of tripeptides, which explains the good affinity for binding and transport by the peptide carriers. Because cefadroxil, the aminocephalosporin, is a substrate of intestinal and renal peptide transporters and because of its enzymatic stability, it has been used in expression cloning to isolate the cDNA clones that encode PEPT 1 and PEPT 2 [7, 21]. This prototypical aminocephalosporin has a Kₘ of 1.1 mM for PEPT 1 and 50 μM for PEPT 2 [7, 21]. Figure 3 shows several β-lactams that are transported by mammalian peptide transporters [22, 23] and many

Fig. 2. Model of peptide transport in epithelial cells from intestine and kidney. Dipeptides and tripeptides, β-lactams, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and several prodrugs are taken up into the cells against a concentration gradient by peptide transporter 1 (PEPT 1) and PEPT 2, the activities of which are coupled to the movement of protons down an electrochemical proton gradient. The velocity of transport is determined by membrane voltage. In the main, the proton gradient is generated and maintained by NHE-3, the apical Na⁺-H⁺ antiporter, with intracellular Na⁺ removed by Na⁺-K⁺ ATPase in the basolateral membrane. Whereas dipeptides and tripeptides undergo rapid intracellular hydrolysis and free amino acids leave cells via basolateral transporters, hydrolysis-resistant substrates, which include most peptidomimetics, are released into the circulation by a basolateral peptide transporter that is yet to be identified and/or by other drug-transporting systems.

Fig. 3. Some β-lactams, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, peptidomimetics, prodrugs and non-peptidic compounds that are transported by mammalian peptide transporters. Competition studies show that many more compounds interact with the substrate-binding domains of peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) and PEPT2, which indicates that they might also be substrates. The minimal structural similarities between the different classes of substrates are shown for cefadroxil, a tripeptide and captopril.

more interact with the substrate-binding sites of these transporters in competition assays, indicating that they are also substrates. As with dipeptides and tripeptides, the transporters discriminate between β-lactam antibiotics, with PEPT2 having higher affinity than PEPT1 for all zwitterionic β-lactams. In the case of anionic compounds, such as cefixime and ceftibuten, affinity for PEPT1 is much higher than for PEPT2 [23, 24]. Moreover, a more acidic external pH is required for efficient rheogenic uptake of cefixime, compared with that of cefadroxil, by PEPT1. This might explain the lower availability *in vivo* of anionic β-lactams if the pH at the apical membrane of intestinal cells is not sufficiently acidic [25].

It is generally accepted that substrates of PEPT1, such as orally active β-lactams and, particularly, aminocephalosporins, have high absorption rates *in vivo*. Comparing 23 penicillins and cephalosporins in competitive uptake studies in human intestinal Caco-2 cells that express PEPT1, there is a correlation between the *in vitro* affinity for PEPT1 and the oral availability rates in humans for almost all compounds [22]. Although the free amino group at the N-terminal position of drug substrates of transporters is not essential, aminopenicillins and aminocephalosporins have higher affinities and higher transport rates than other β-lactams. For most β-lactams, the affinity of the basolateral peptide transporter that facilitates the efflux from enterocytes into the circulation is lower than that of PEPT1 [11]. This allows uptake into cells against the concentration gradient and efficient transcellular absorption.

Both PEPT1 and PEPT2 play a role in the pharmacokinetics of β-lactams. PEPT2 removes β-lactams from the circulation by transporting them into target cells and, together with PEPT1, mediates their reabsorption into tubular cells after glomerular filtration. Other transporters in the kidney, such as the organic anion transporter OAT1 (SLC22A6) [26] and the organic cation/carnitine transporter OCTN2 (SLC22A5) [27], might also contribute to the renal handling of several β-lactams.

Inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used currently in the treatment of hypertension and, because some ACE inhibitors slow the progression of dementia and affect cerebrovascular structure and function, new therapeutic uses of these compounds are being considered [28]. The most widely used ACE inhibitors, captopril and enalapril, are both substrates

http://tips.trends.com

of PEPT1 [21], which most probably explains their good oral availability. However, both captopril and enalapril have very low affinity for PEPT2 [7, 29] and therefore this transporter is unlikely to mediate the renal reabsorption of these compounds; enalapril has a much higher affinity for OATP1 in the apical membrane of the proximal tubule [30] and thus its renal reabsorption might be mediated by OATP1. By contrast, PEPT2 transports fosinopril with a high affinity (K<sub>m</sub> = 22 μM) [31] and, unlike enalapril, which has a rather low affinity for PEPT1 (K<sub>i</sub> = 10.8 mM) [29], fosinopril also possesses a high affinity for PEPT1 (K<sub>m</sub> = 0.15 mM). However, clinically, both fosinopril and enalapril are orally active with similar bioavailability (30–40%) and plasma half-life (~11 h). These similarities, despite the different affinities for PEPT1, might be explained by the presence of other transporters, such as OATP3 [32], that can transport enalapril in the apical membrane of enterocytes.

**Aminopeptidase inhibitors**

Bestatin (also known as ubenimex) is a dipeptide mimetic (Fig. 3) that competitively inhibits aminopeptidase B and leucine aminopeptidase. It is reported to be a biological response modifier and an indirectly acting antitumor agent that potentiates the host immune response [33]. Bestatin is a good substrate for PEPT1 and PEPT2 [34]. Nakanishi *et al.* implanted HeLa cells transfected with human PEPT1 cells in mice. Daily administration of bestatin for one month significantly decreased the viability of the implanted cells compared with mock-transfected control cells [33]. Although the clinical relevance of this observation in treating cancer remains to be determined, PEPT1 mRNA is expressed and the protein is active in a variety of human cancer cell lines [33, 35]. In addition, because cancer cells require large quantities of peptide-bound amino acids for growth and metabolism, peptide transporters might be upregulated in these cells and could provide a good method for delivering antineoplastic drugs.

**Prodrugs and non-peptidic compounds**

3,4-Dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA) is used either alone or in combination with carbidopa for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. The bioavailability of L-DOPA varies, with a mean rate of ~30%, and Tamai *et al.* [36] tested the ability of peptide-levodopa derivatives as prodrugs to increase the intestinal absorption of L-DOPA. Using Caco-2 cells as an intestinal model, Tamai and colleagues demonstrated that administration of L-DOPA–L-Phe enhanced uptake 40-fold compared with that of free L-DOPA. This provides an example of how the bioavailability of a drug can be improved by derivatization to obtain a peptide or peptidomimetic. Another example is valacyclovir (Fig. 3). This L-valyl ester of acyclovir is a prodrug that has a bioavailability that is 3–5-fold higher than that of free acyclovir. Valacyclovir, but not acyclovir, inhibits uptake of dipeptides by PEPT1 in

Caco-2 cells and by PEPT2 in SKPT cells [37], which indicates that it is transported by PEPT1 and PEPT2. The L-valine esterification of zidovudine, which is used alone or together with zalcitabine to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, also inhibits the transport of dipeptides in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells transfected with human PEPT1 [38]. Coupling an amino acid residue to a drug, as with the antiviral nucleosides [38], appears currently to be the easiest approach to render a drug a substrate of peptide transporters.

The photoactivation of endogenously accumulated porphyrins, leading to apoptosis or necrosis, is being explored for the treatment of a variety of human cancers. The accumulation of porphyrins is also used diagnostically to identify transformed cells and tumors [39, 40]. It involves administering a photosensitizing agent, which, in the case of porphyrin-based approaches, is 5-aminolevulinic acid (δ-ALA). Although δ-ALA is a medium-chain omega-amino fatty acid with a carbonyl group in the 5-position, it is a good substrate for PEPT1 and PEPT2 [41], with an affinity for both transporters of ~0.25 mM. In view of the expression of peptide transporters in tumor cells, the handling of δ-ALA by peptide transporters has implications for porphyrin-based diagnosis and tumor therapy. Furthermore, because PEPT2 is located on the apical membrane of epithelial cells of the choroid plexus [42], it might also clear δ-ALA from the cerebrospinal fluid and prevent the accumulation of δ-ALA in the brain, which is associated with neuropsychiatric symptoms observed frequently in inherited porphyrias.

**Essential structural elements of substrates**

To understand the basis of the apparent promiscuity of the peptide transporters for transport of thousands of substrates, non-rational and rational approaches for elucidating substrate specificity have been applied (Fig. 4).

A peptide bond is not an essential requirement for transport because substitution by either a ketomethylene [43] or a thioxo [44] function does not impair affinity or transport. More surprising is the finding that ω-amino fatty acids (ω-AFA) with more than four backbone carbon units are transported by PEPT1 without significant loss of affinity compared with normal dipeptides [45]. Altering the chain length and energy-minimization calculations have established minimal requirements for substrate recognition by PEPT1: the two oppositely charged head groups are separated by an intramolecular spacer of four carbon units that give, on a planar conformation, a distance of >500 and <630 pm between the centers of the head groups. δ-ALA also conforms to this minimal structure, with an additional carbonyl function at position 4 that enhances its affinity for PEPT1 by twofold and for PEPT2 by almost 35-fold compared with the affinities of 5-aminopentanoic acid (5-APA) [46]. The essential

Fig. 4. Model of the essential structural elements of substrates that enable them to be accommodated within the substrate-binding domain of mammalian peptide transporters. Elements that are not essential but affect affinity, such as the backbone carbonyl function and the amino acid side-chains of peptides (denoted R₁, R₂ and R₃), are also included. This preliminary template is derived from the analysis of binding and transport of a variety of substrates of peptide transporter 1 (PEPT1) and PEPT2, including omega amino fatty acid and amino acid derivatives, dipeptides, tripeptides and peptidomimetics. The relevant substrate features are: (1) the N-terminus of a substrate, preferentially a free NH₃⁺ group; (2) the planar length-defined backbone from the N-terminal α carbon to R₂, with an incorporated backbone carbonyl function for hydrogen bonding; and (3) the stereochemistry, with L-selectivity at the R₂ position. R₂ needs not only a specific orientation but also some hydrophobicity to match a hydrophobic pocket with a strong directional vector. This allows substrates that fill this pocket but do not have a C-terminal COO⁻ group to be transported. To accommodate R₃, another pocket with a preference for hydrophobic residues is predicted. The second carboxylate-binding site (e.g. a C-terminal COO⁻ group) is also not absolutely necessary but, when present, needs a particular spatial location within the binding pocket.

The role of the backbone carbonyl function but not the peptide bond in substrate affinity is demonstrated by the observation that PEPT2 does not recognize compounds formed when only nitrogen is incorporated into the backbone of 5-APA to mimic the nitrogen of the peptide bond.

Although not essential in principal, in dipeptides and tripeptides only the trans-configuration of the peptide bond is transported [47], and the hydrophobicity of the side-chain amino acids, particularly that of the C-terminal residues, is an important factor that determines substrate affinity [48]. The terminal carboxylic group in substrates is also not required for transport and can be replaced by an electrogenic group as shown for a variety of amino acid aryl amides [48]. However, depending on the mesomeric and inductive properties of substituents attached to the aryl group, affinity changes drastically and no longer predicts transport [46]. The first high-affinity,

competitive inhibitors of peptide transporters (Kᵢ values in the micromolar and nanomolar range for PEPT1 and PEPT2, respectively) have been identified recently, based on lysyl-dipeptides that have [Z(NO₂)]-groups attached to the ε-amino function of the side-chain [49,50].

Although knowledge of the structure of the substrate-binding domain and the residues involved in interaction with functional groups of substrates is sparse, models of substrate templates in PEPT1 have been proposed [51,52]. It must be emphasized that the templates are derived from sets of data obtained in different expression systems and under variable experimental conditions, and are therefore very preliminary. Nevertheless, based on these models, predictions of structure–affinity relationships might promote the rational design of drugs and prodrugs that target peptide transporters. Until the three-dimensional structure of the transporter proteins is available, current models must be refined by trial and error. Furthermore, because template predictions are based mainly on data from competition experiments, which, as recent studies show, do not necessarily predict transport, direct demonstration of transport requires either tracer-flux studies or electrophysiological studies.

### Concluding remarks

Peptide transporters have an important role, not only in nutrition but also in pharmacology. In the latter context they transport a variety of compounds with different structural and chemical characteristics, including classical drugs such as several β-lactams and ACE inhibitors as well as a variety of prodrugs. Based on the high concentration of peptide transporters and high transport capacity in tissues such as the small intestine and lung, they appear to be good targets for the delivery of drugs. Peptide transporters in other tissues, such as the brain and kidney might also contribute to drug pharmacokinetics. Research into polymorphisms in the genes that encode peptide transporters and their promoters is required to better define their role in drug delivery, deposition and renal elimination. Mice that lack either PEPT1 or PEPT2 have been generated and should soon be available to refine the nutritional and pharmacological role of these transporters.

Recent structure–function analyses of hundreds of compounds have led to the first predictions of the substrate characteristics that allow efficient binding to peptide transporters. This will allow the rational design of new therapeutic agents to be delivered via the peptide transporters.
