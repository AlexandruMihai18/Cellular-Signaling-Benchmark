The genome of *Leishmania major*, the causative agent of cutaneous leishmaniasis, contains three almost identical genes encoding putative glutathione peroxidases, which differ only at their N- and C-termini. Because the gene homologues are essential in trypanosomes, they may also represent potential drug targets in *Leishmania*. Recombinant protein for the shortest of these showed negligible peroxidase activity with glutathione as the electron donor indicating that it is not a bone fide glutathione peroxidase. By contrast, high peroxidase activity was obtained with tryparedoxin, indicating that these proteins belong to a new class of monomeric tryparedoxin-dependent peroxidases (TDPX) distinct from the classical decameric 2-Cys peroxiredoxins (TryP). Mass spectrometry studies revealed that oxidation of TDPX1 with peroxides results in the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys35 and Cys83. Site-directed mutagenesis and kinetic studies showed that Cys35 is essential for peroxidase activity, whereas Cys83 is essential for reduction by tryparedoxin. Detailed kinetic studies comparing TDPX1 and TryP1 showed that both enzymes obey saturation ping-pong kinetics with respect to tryparedoxin and peroxide. Both enzymes show high affinity for tryparedoxin and broad substrate specificity for hydroperoxides. TDPX1 shows higher affinity towards hydrogen peroxide and cumene hydroperoxide than towards *t*-butyl hydroperoxide, whereas no specific substrate preference could be detected for TryP1. TDPX1 exhibits rate constants up to $8 \times 10^4 \, \text{M}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$, whereas TryP1 exhibits higher rate constants $\sim 10^6 \, \text{M}^{-1} \cdot \text{s}^{-1}$. All three TDPX proteins together constitute $\sim 0.05\%$ of the *L. major* promastigote protein content, whereas the TryPs are $\sim 40$ times more abundant. Possible specific functions of TDPXs are discussed.

Leishmaniasis is a disease complex caused by over 18 species of *Leishmania* infecting 12 million people worldwide (World Health Organization). Dependent on the species, these eukaryotic parasites affect a wide range of clinical symptoms: from cutaneous (self-healing skin ulcers) (e.g. *L. major*) to mucocutaneous (e.g. *L. braziliensis*) to visceral forms (e.g. *L. donovani*, *L. infantum*). The latter is invariably fatal if left untreated. Current treatments are unsatisfactory and better drugs are urgently required. Most parasites, including *Leishmania* spp., are more susceptible to reactive oxygen species than their hosts [1,2]. Mammalian cells have a battery of enzymatic systems for metabolizing hydroperoxides: catalase, selenium- and sulfur-dependent glutathione peroxidases (GPXs), glutathione-dependent 1-Cys peroxiredoxins,

and thioredoxin-dependent 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. With the exception of catalase, reducing equivalents for the reduction of hydroperoxides are derived from NADPH either via glutathione reductase or thioredoxin reductase. In contrast, *Leishmania* lack catalase, selenium-dependent peroxidases, glutathione reductase and thioredoxin reductase. Instead, the entire antioxidant defence system (either haem-dependent ascorbate peroxidases [3,4] or thiol-dependent peroxidases) is mediated via the unique dithiol trypanothione (*N*¹,*N*⁸-bis(glutathionyl)spermidine) together with NADPH-dependent trypanothione reductase (TryR), an essential enzyme in *Leishmania* spp. [5–7].

The first class of thiol-dependent peroxidases belongs to the classical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins. This comprises: NADPH; TryR; trypanothione; trypanothione peroxidase (TryX), an 18 kDa protein with similar functions to thioredoxin; and trypanothione peroxidase type I (TryP), a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin [8]. TryPs were originally identified and characterized in *Crithidia fasciculata* [8–12] and these have been subsequently identified and studied in a variety of trypanosomatids [13–18]. Additional roles for TryP have been proposed, for example, metastasis in *L. guyanensis* [19] and arsenite resistance in *L. amazonensis* [20]. *L. major* TryP is also a putative vaccine candidate [21].

The second class of thiol-dependent peroxidases are GPX-like with closest similarity to the mammalian selenoprotein GPX4. On the basis of their thiol substrate specificity these can be subdivided into two types. The first type, exemplified by *Trypanosoma cruzi* GPXII, apparently shows specific, but low activity with glutathione and none at all with trypanothione [22]. This enzyme is specific for linoleic hydroperoxide and shows no activity towards hydrogen peroxide or short-chain hydroperoxides. The second type, exemplified by *T. cruzi* GPXI [23] and *T. brucei* Px III [24], are actually trypanothione-dependent peroxidases with low, nonphysiological activity with glutathione [24,25]. Both enzymes will use cumene hydroperoxide as substrate, whereas *T. cruzi* GPXI is inactive with hydrogen peroxide. RNA interference studies in *T. brucei* demonstrated that both Px III and TryP are essential for parasite survival [26,27]. This suggests that these enzymes may represent much-needed novel drug targets. However, their unique roles in trypanosome metabolism still need to be identified. Because the glutathione peroxidase-like proteins do not contain selenocysteine and show negligible activity with glutathione we subsequently refer to type II trypanothione-dependent peroxidases as TDPXs to distinguish them from the structurally unrelated decameric type I trypanothione peroxidases (TryP). Despite the fact that *Leishmania*

spp. are obligate intracellular parasites of macrophages, and therefore live in a potentially hostile oxidizing environment in the mammalian stage of their life cycle, none of these TDPX proteins has been characterized in any *Leishmania* spp. The cytosolic *L. major* TryP has been shown to have trypanothione-dependent peroxidase activity but no kinetic analysis has been performed [13]. Comparative studies on TryP and TDPX trypanothione peroxidases have not been reported.

Using the recently published genome of *L. major* [28], we identified three GPX-like proteins encoded in a tandem array on chromosome 26. These proteins merely differ in their N- and C-terminal sequences, suggesting a common reaction mechanism, but different subcellular localizations. In this study, we analyse the physicochemical, mechanistic and kinetic properties of the putative cytosolic GPX-like protein (TDPX1) and compare it with the classical trypanothione peroxidase (TryP1) from the *L. major* Friedlin genome strain.

### Results

Recently, glutathione peroxidase-like proteins from *T. brucei* and *T. cruzi* have been shown to be trypanothione-dependent peroxidases [25,27]. The aim of this study was to analyse the homologous proteins in *L. major* and compare them with classical TryP, a 2-Cys peroxiredoxin-like peroxidase. The genome of the *L. major* Friedlin strain revealed three genes (TDPX1, 2 and 3; Fig. 1) arranged in an array on chromosome 26 encoding proteins with homology to mammalian glutathione peroxidases. A selenocysteine, a tryptophan and a glutamine residue form a catalytic triad in the active site in mammalian GPX4 and are essential for peroxidase activity [29]. Selenocysteine is replaced by a cysteine in all three *L. major* glutathione peroxidase-like proteins, but the tryptophan and glutamine residues are conserved (Cys35, Gln71 and Trp125, LmTDPX1 numbering; Fig. 1). The three *L. major* sequences differ only in their N- and C-terminal sequences, whereas the core proteins are identical from residues 2–161. The corresponding nucleotide sequences encoding this region are also identical. TDPX2 and TDPX3 have an additional extension at the N-terminus which is a putative mitochondrial targeting sequence. TDPX3 also has a putative glycosomal targeting sequence (SKI) at the shorter C-terminus [30]. TDPX1 lacks these putative signals and is therefore likely to be a cytosolic protein. Thus the three different genes encode an almost identical protein possibly targeted to different subcellular localizations. TDPX1 from *L. major* protein has 65 and 63%

Fig. 1. Multiple sequence alignment of experimentally characterized and predicted glutathione peroxidase-like proteins. Parasite proteins are encoded by the following ORFs in GeneDB: *Leishmania major*, LmTDPX1 (LmjF26.0820), LmTDPX2 (LmjF26.0810), LmTDPX3 (LmjF26.0800); *Trypanosoma brucei*, TbTDPX1 (Tb927.7.1120), TbTDPX2 (Tb927.7.1130), TbTDPX3 (Tb927.7.1140); *Trypanosoma cruzi*, TcTDPX1 (Tc00.1047053503899.110), TcTDPX2 (Tc00.1047053503899.119), TcTDPX3 (Tc00.1047053503899.130). The other proteins have the following ExPASy Swiss-Prot accession numbers: *Arabidopsis thaliana* AtGPX6 (O48646), *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* ScGPX2 (P38143), *Homo sapiens* HsGPX4 (P36969). Conserved (black background) and similar residues (grey background) are indicated by asterisks and dots, respectively. Cysteine residues are coloured in yellow and the three conserved amino acids involved in peroxidase activity are marked with an inverted triangle. The cysteine shown in this study to be involved in disulfide-bridge formation with the active site cysteine is marked with a square. The differences in the three *L. major* GPX-like proteins are marked in red. Percent identities to LmTDPX1 indicated at the end of the alignments.

identity with the homologous proteins in *T. cruzi* and *T. brucei*, respectively, and only 37% with human GPX4, the most similar among the mammalian GPXs. Interestingly, the *L. major* glutathione peroxidase-like proteins have six Cys residues, whereas only three Cys residues are conserved in most other organisms including *T. brucei* and *T. cruzi* (Fig. 1).

The full-length ORF of LmjF26.0820, which encodes the putative cytosolic protein TDPX1, was cloned into pET-15b and expressed in BL21 (DE3) pLysS with an N-terminal His-tag. The protein was purified by Ni-NTA chromatography with a yield of ~20 mg·L⁻¹ of *Escherichia coli* culture (Fig. 2A). After removal of the hexahistidine-tag and further purification, the protein was analysed by size-exclusion chromatography and found to elute under reducing conditions as single peak with an apparent molecular mass of 16.6 kDa (Fig. 2B), indicating that TDPX1 is monomeric (*m* 19.6 kDa). At higher protein concentrations (>2 mg·mL⁻¹) a second less-abundant peak corresponding to a dimer was observed (data not shown). Analysis of both peaks by SDS/PAGE under nonreducing conditions showed both peaks ran as monomers. Thus the native monomeric protein can form noncovalent dimers at high protein concentrations (data not shown). In addition, prolonged storage

under nonreducing conditions with exposure to air can promote the formation of TDPX1 aggregates linked by disulfide bridges at high protein concentration (data not shown).

The gene sequence of the published *L. major* TryP [13] differs slightly from those in the *L. major* genome. Thus, for comparative purposes, we re-cloned and expressed cytosolic TryP1 (LmjF15.1120) as well as the putative cytosolic trypanothione (TryX, LmjF29.1160) from the genome strain. TryP1 and TryX are both highly expressed proteins and could be purified in a single step as His-tagged proteins (15–20 mg·L⁻¹ bacterial culture).

### Peroxidase activity

To analyse the peroxidase activity of the putative glutathione peroxidase-like protein an assay was established containing NADPH, glutathione reductase, glutathione (GSH) as the reducing agent and hydrogen peroxide (Fig. 3A). With the *L. major* peroxidase there was a negligible difference (0.00145 ± 0.00023 s⁻¹) in the decrease of absorption due to NADPH consumption with or without peroxidase in the assay (Fig. 3B), which is much less than the rate of the direct reduction of hydrogen peroxide by GSH alone. By contrast, when selenocysteine-dependent bovine GPX was used as a positive control, GSH-dependent peroxidase activity could be readily detected (Fig. 3C).

Replacing GSH and glutathione reductase in the assay with the trypanothione system (*T. cruzi* TryR, trypanothione and *L. major* TryX, Fig. 3D) efficient peroxidase activity of TDPX1 could be detected (Fig. 3E). Thus the *L. major* glutathione peroxidase-like protein is a trypanothione-dependent peroxidase (TDPX1). By contrast, bovine GPX could not be reduced by the trypanothione system indicating major differences in substrate specificity between mammalian GPX and parasite TDPX1 (Fig. 3F).

### Kinetic mechanism

The peroxidase activity of TDPX1 towards different hydroperoxides was analysed in the trypanothione-dependent assay. TryX was held constant at several fixed concentrations while the hydroperoxide concentration was varied. Assay conditions were checked to ensure that neither TryR nor trypanothione were limiting in the assays at the highest concentration of TryX.

The individual data sets obey simple Michaelis-Menten kinetics and the double-reciprocal transformation yields parallel lines (Fig. 4A) consistent with a ping-pong mechanism. In a secondary plot (Fig. 4B) the reciprocal TryX concentrations are plotted against the intercepts from the primary plot (Fig. 4A). The intercept of the second plot is not zero and represents the reciprocal value of the maximal velocity (*k*ₐₜ). Thus the protein shows saturation kinetics. Values for *k*ₐₜ and *K*ₘ were determined using a global fit of the data sets to Eqn (1) for TryX and each of the hydroperoxide substrates and are summarized in Table 1.

*Lm*TDPX1 exhibited highest affinity towards hydrogen peroxide (*K*ₘ = 193 ± 27 µM) and cumene hydroperoxide (*K*ₘ = 207 ± 14 µM), but lowest affinity

Similar values were obtained with hydrogen peroxide as substrate using the integrated Dalziel rate Eqn (2) for a bi-substrate mechanism (see Experimental procedures and Table 1). However, analysis with varying the hydroperoxide concentrations yields more accurate kinetic parameters.

Under the same conditions, the kinetic properties of TryP1 were analysed to compare them with TDPX1. However, high hydroperoxide concentrations inactivate TryP1 in a time- and concentration-dependent manner (Fig. 5A). This is similar to other peroxiredoxin-like peroxidases, where a sulfenic acid (-SO₂H) is formed due to oxidation of the sulfenic acid (-SOH) intermediate in the reaction cycle [31, 32]. Sulfenic acids cannot be reduced directly by thioredoxins or trypanothioperoxidases

and consequently inactivation of the peroxidases occurs. Thus, the classical analytical method cannot be used and single curve progression analysis was performed instead using the integrated rate Eqn (2) with different concentrations of TryX and a fixed, noninhibitory concentration of hydroperoxide [8, 33]. Representative plots are shown in Fig. 5B,C with cumene hydroperoxide as substrate. In the primary plot (Fig. 5B) the integrated reciprocal initial velocity multiplied by the enzyme concentration was plotted against the integrated reciprocal hydroperoxide concentrations. The reciprocal slope corresponds to the rate constant $k_{1}$ for the reduction of hydroperoxides. In a secondary plot (Fig. 5C), the ordinate intercepts of the first plot are re-plotted against the reciprocal

Assays were performed with $5 \mu \mathrm{M}$ TryX and varying amounts of cumene hydroperoxide ($50-1000 \mu \mathrm{M}$). Reactions were started with the addition of either TDPX1 ($0.2 \mu \mathrm{M}$) or TryP1 ($0.2 \mu \mathrm{M}$) and initial rates determined. TDPX1 (open circles) follows Michaelis-Menten kinetics, whereas TryP1 (closed circles) is inactivated with increasing hydroperoxide concentration.

TryX concentrations. The reciprocal intercept gives the value for the maximum velocity (*k*~cat~) and the reciprocal slope corresponds to the rate constant *k*₂ for TryX reduction. The *K*ₘ values can be obtained by dividing *k*~cat~ by the rate constants *k*₁ or *k*₂ (Table 1). An average limiting *k*~cat~ of ~8–9 s⁻¹ could be observed for all three hydroperoxides tested. Also the rate constants for the reduction of the hydroperoxides are all in a similar range from ~0.9–1.3 × 10⁶ M⁻¹·s⁻¹. The rate constants for TryX (*k*₂ = *k*~cat~/*K*ₘ) are in the range 1.7–3 × 10⁶ M⁻¹·s⁻¹ and only slightly higher than *k*₁. The *K*ₘ values towards the different hydroperoxides are also quite similar ranging from 6.3 to 10.5 μM. Thus TryP1 shows good activity with all three substrates with no specific preference.

### Expression of TDPX, TryP and TryX in *L. major* promastigotes

Western blot analysis was used to estimate the concentration of TDPX, TryP and TryX in *L. major* promastigotes using different amounts of nontagged recombinant protein as calibration standards (Fig. 6). *L. major* protein extracts were prepared from exponentially growing and stationary phase cells. The same amount of protein extract was loaded in each lane and verified by Coomassie Brilliant Blue staining (Fig. 6, right panel). Representative western blots are shown in Fig. 6, left panel. The antisera were highly specific and only a single band was detected in *L. major* protein extracts at the expected size of each individual recombinant nontagged protein (data not shown). No major differences in the expression levels of TDPX, TryP and TryX could be observed between the exponentially growing and stationary phase. A protein content of 5.8 ± 0.7 μg (per 10⁶ parasites) and a mean cell volume of 37.4 ± 0.3 nL (per 10⁶ parasites) was obtained in logarithmic or stationary phase of growth. By densitometric analysis TDPX is estimated to represent 0.02–0.08% of the total protein content. Likewise TryP and TryX represent 1–4% and 0.1–0.3% of total protein. With the calculated molecular mass of TryX (16.5 kDa), TDPX1 (19.3 kDa) and TryP1 (22.1 kDa) the concentrations in *L. major* promastigotes can be estimated to be 9.4–28.2, 1.6–6.4 and 70–280 μM, respectively. TDPX1, TDPX2 and TDPX3 and the different TryP proteins cannot be separated by SDS/PAGE and are not distinguished by western blot analysis so that these values represent overall estimations of the relative abundance.

#### TDPX1 forms an intramolecular disulfide bridge

Most 2-Cys peroxiredoxins form two intermolecular disulfide bridges upon oxidation resulting in a homodimer as smallest functional subunit. Consistent with this, TryP1 is detected as a monomer under reducing SDS/PAGE and as a dimer following oxidation with peroxide and separation under nonreducing conditions (Fig. 7). In contrast, reduced and oxidized TDPX1 show only slightly different mobility and thus covalent dimer formation clearly does not occur following oxidation by peroxide (Fig. 7). However, this minor change in mobility could be due to the formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge. To test this hypothesis, the thiol content of reduced and peroxide oxidized

**Fig. 6.** Estimation of TDPX, TryP and TryX concentrations in *L. major* promastigotes. Proteins and parasite extracts were separated by SDS/PAGE under reducing conditions and analysed by western blotting as described under experimental procedures. Equal amounts of *L. major* promastigotes from mid-log (L) and stationary phase (S) of growth were analysed: 3.0 × 10⁶ cells for TDPX or 1.5 × 10⁶ cells for TryP and TryX. Recombinant nontagged proteins were used as calibration standards (TDPX1: 4–20 ng, TryP1: 250–1000 ng, TryX: 4–20 ng). Band intensity was proportional to the amount of recombinant protein added. At least two independent experiments were performed. The right-hand panel is stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue to show equal loading for extracts prepared from either phase of growth.

Fig. 7. SDS/PAGE analysis of reduced and oxidized TDPX1, TDPX1 mutants and TryP1. Proteins were first reduced with dithiothreitol or oxidized with H₂O₂ and then residual sulphydryl groups were alkylated with iodoacetamide as described in Experimental procedures. Aliquots (2 μg per lane) were separated by SDS/PAGE and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue: lanes 1 and 2, TDPX1 wild-type; lanes 3 and 4, TDPX1 Cys35Ala; lanes 5 and 6, TDPX1 Cys83Ala; lanes 7 and 8, TryP1 wild-type. Odd numbered lanes are reduced with dithiothreitol and even numbered lanes oxidized with H₂O₂. The schematics show the predicted disulfide bond arrangement for TDPX1 and TryP1.

protein was analysed using 5,5′-dithio-bis(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (Nbs₂). After reduction by dithiothreitol and separation by size-exclusion chromatography native TDPX1 was found to contain 5.2 ± 0.3 thiol groups per monomer, in good agreement with the six predicted from the gene sequence (Fig. 1). Addition of SDS (2% final concentration) did not alter this result indicating that all cysteine residues are accessible to the thiol reagent. After oxidation with a fivefold excess of hydrogen peroxide and removal of residual peroxide using a desalting column, the thiol content decreased to 3.5 ± 0.1 thiol groups per monomer. The difference of 1.7 ± 0.3 thiol groups between the two preparations is thus consistent with formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge following oxidation by hydrogen peroxide.

To determine the nature of the disulfide bridge formed, reduced and oxidized TDPX1 were digested with trypsin and the peptides analysed by mass spectrometry (Fig. 8A,B). In the spectrum of the oxidized protein one additional peak is apparent which cannot be found in the spectrum of the reduced protein. The mass of this peak can be assigned to the sum of two peptides containing two cysteine residues (−2H + 1), namely those containing the Cys35 and the Cys83 residues (Fig. 1). An additional cysteine corresponding to Cys64 is conserved in all TDPXs. Although no peak with the corresponding mass could be assigned to a peptide containing Cys64, it is possible that we were not able to detect this under our experimental conditions. To eliminate this possibility, a second sample was digested with chymotrypsin and analysed as above (Fig. 8C,D). Again one additional peak was detected in the oxidized spectrum which was absent in the reduced one and again the mass fitted to the sum of the two peptides (−2H + 1) containing the same cysteine residues, Cys35 and Cys83. Also, in the spectra of the oxidized and reduced protein the peptides containing the conserved Cys64 residue was detected. Thus, these results suggest specific disulfide bridge formation between Cys35 and Cys83, not involving Cys64.

### Site-directed mutagenesis

Site-directed mutagenesis of Cys35, Cys64 and Cys83 to Ala were performed to extend the findings of the MS analysis. The Cys35Ala and Cys83Ala mutants were expressed and purified as before. However, the Cys64Ala mutant was less soluble than the wild-type protein, did not bind specifically to the Ni-NTA column and precipitated during concentration. The Cys35Ala and Cys83Ala mutants showed partial mobility shifts under reducing and oxidizing conditions by SDS/PAGE with some higher aggregate formation evident following peroxide treatment (Fig. 7). Abrogation of the mobility shift is more pronounced in the Cys35Ala mutant. Extending the alkylation reaction to 3 h with the addition of 2% SDS part way through the incubation in the presence of increased (300 mM) iodoacetamide did not change the protein pattern, suggesting that incomplete alkylation is not responsible for the observed partial mobility shifts of the mutants. Dimer formation is most evident in Cys83Ala, with lesser amounts in the Cys35Ala mutant and none in the wild-type, which only shows aggregation at high

agent than the wild-type protein, equivalent to 64% of the wild-type activity in the TryX-dependent assay. In contrast, GSH did not show this effect. The Cys35Ala mutant exhibited no peroxidase activity at all with dithiothreitol or GSH. These results demonstrate that Cys35 is the essential catalytic residue and suggest Cys83 is important for regeneration of Cys35 by TryX.

### Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence

Classical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins are well known for their conformational changes dependent on their redox state [34,35]. As TDPX1 has only one tryptophan residue (see Fig. 1) this can be utilized to analyse whether a conformational change occurs during the reaction cycle of the enzyme. The emission spectrum of the indole group of tryptophan is highly dependent on the nature of its environment. The emission maximum of free indole is near 340 nm, whereas it is blue-shifted when it is in a hydrophobic environment, for instance when it is buried within a native protein [36]. Wild-type TDPX1 and the mutants Cys35Ala and Cys83Ala were reduced with 10 mM dithiothreitol or oxidized with two equivalents of hydrogen peroxide, respectively. Dithiothreitol, trace amounts of oxidized dithiothreitol or hydrogen peroxide did not influence the spectra (data not shown). The emission maximum in the spectrum of the oxidized wild-type protein is 341.5 nm (Fig. 9), suggesting the tryptophan residue is located in a hydrophilic environment likely at the protein surface. Reduction with dithiothreitol mediates a blue-shift of the emission maximum to 332 nm indicating a movement of the tryptophan into a more hydrophobic environment, probably into the interior of the protein. The reduced and oxidized spectra of the C83A mutant look similar to the corresponding wild-type spectra. Therefore, the Cys83 residue and disulfide-bridge formation are not essential for the redox-dependent change in fluorescence emission. The spectrum of the oxidized Cys35Ala mutant has an emission maximum of 340 nm, similar to the wild-type oxidized protein. The spectrum of the reduced protein showed no blue-shift of the emission maximum. This suggests that oxidation of the active-site cysteine residue triggers a conformational change in TDPX1. In the wild-type spectrum of the reduced protein another effect can be observed: the overall fluorescence is largely quenched. Thus two major effects can be observed upon reduction of TDPX1 wild-type: first, blue-shift of the emission maximum; and second, quenching of the fluorescence. In all, it can be concluded that the tryptophan environment is different in the two redox stages and thus it can be speculated that a conformational change has to take place during the reaction cycle.

### Discussion

The results presented here represent the first comprehensive comparison of the TDPX and TryP classes of

tryparedoxin peroxidases in *Leishmania* spp. Despite significant sequence similarity to mammalian GPX4, $LmTDPX1$ is a bone fide tryparedoxin peroxidase with no physiologically relevant activity with GSH as electron donor. This agrees with previous reports on the orthologues $TbTDPX3$ [24] and $TcTDPX2$ [25].

Kinetic analysis of $LmTDPX1$ with $LmTryX$ as reducing agent shows saturation kinetics obeying a Bi Bi ping-pong mechanism. This kinetic behaviour matches that for $TcTDPX2$ [37], but is in contrast to $TbTDPX3$, which has been reported to follow an unsaturated ping-pong mechanism with infinite $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ and $k_{\mathrm{cat}}$ with TryX [24]. The reason for this discrepancy is not clear – all three species contain additional tryparedoxin-like proteins containing a WCPPC motif, but the $LmTryX$ used here shows greatest similarity (58% identity) to $TbTryX$ used in earlier studies. Differences in assay conditions or the presence of a histidine tag on the longer N-terminus of $TbTDPX3$ might also be contributing factors. Nonetheless, in terms of substrate specificity towards hydroperoxides, $LmTDPX1$ more closely resembles $TbTDPX3$ rather than $TcTDPX2$, which is apparently inactive with $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ as substrate. Thus substrate specificity and mechanism can not be deduced simply on the basis of sequence similarity alone.

Our biochemical studies on $LmTDPX1$ reveal that the enzyme is functional as a monomer with the loss of two thiols per mole of enzyme following oxidation with $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$. Mass spectrometry and mutagenesis studies indicate formation of a specific disulfide bridge between Cys35 and Cys83. Cys35 is the equivalent residue to the active site selenocysteine in mammalian GPXs and the Cys35Ala mutant is devoid of enzyme activity, indicating that Cys35 is involved in catalysis. The Cys83Ala mutant shows only 1% of wild-type activity with TryX indicating that formation of an intramolecular disulfide is important for interaction with TryX. In contrast, this mutant displayed significant activity with dithiothreitol (65% of wild-type) suggesting that the putative Cys35 sulfenic acid intermediate is readily accessible to dithiothreitol, but much less so to GSH or TryX. Attempts to trap the putative intermediate with 4-chloro-7-nitrobenz-2-oxa-1,3-diazole were unsuccessful. The role of the highly conserved Cys64 is less clear, but appears to contribute to the stability of the native conformation of the protein, because we were unable to purify this mutant. Although it could be involved in disulfide-bond formation in the absence of Cys83, it is less likely to be involved in the reaction mechanism because the equivalent mutation (Cys76Ser) in $T.$ brucei TDPX3 had no effect on enzyme activity [38].

Comparison of $L.$ major tryparedoxin peroxidases

Non-specific intramolecular and intermolecular disulfide formation cannot be ruled out based on our current findings.

During completion of this study, Schlecker *et al.* reported that, for $TbTDPX3$, Cys47 is essential for catalytic activity and that oxidation promotes formation of an intramolecular disulfide bridge between Cys47 and Cys95 [38]. These residues in the trypanosome enzyme are the equivalent of Cys35 and Cys83 in the Leishmania enzyme. Thus our results support and complement each other in a distantly related parasite. Using molecular modelling, Schlecker *et al.* suggested that a large conformational change in $TbTDPX3$ would be necessary to bring the Cys95 region into proximity with the postulated Cys47 sulfenate intermediate for disulfide-bond formation. Our studies on intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence could support this hypothesis. In this model this conformational change would cause a shift of the tryptophan into a more polar environment [39]. Clearly, formation of a disulfide-bridge is not an absolute requirement because this effect is observed with the Cys83Ala mutant. However, these spectral changes are only observed when a free Cys35 thiol is present (i.e. wild-type and Cys83Ala, reduced forms). Thus, the observed fluorescence quenching and spectral shift could also be due to a charge interaction between the cysteine-35 thiolate and the tryptophan pyrrole ring [40]. This interpretation lends support to the alternative hypothesis that the structure of the Cys95 containing region is significantly different from that of mammalian GPXs. Structural studies are required to resolve these two alternative proposals.

Comparison between $LmTDPX1$ and $LmTryP1$ revealed some interesting similarities and differences. Both enzymes obey saturable ping-pong kinetics with similar $k_{\mathrm{cat}}$ ($\sim 15$ and $9 \, \mathrm{s}^{-1}$) and $K_{\mathrm{m}}$ ($\sim 3$ and $5 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$) values for $LmTryX$, irrespective of hydroperoxide substrate. The intracellular concentration of $LmTryX$ ($9$–$28 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$) indicates that TryX is a physiologically relevant substrate *in vivo*. Both peroxidases have an N-terminal peroxidative cysteine and a C-terminal resolving cysteine, except in monomeric $LmTDPX1$ these form an intramolecular disulfide, whereas in $LmTryP1$ these form reciprocal intermolecular disulfides between active sites in adjacent monomers forming dimers that oligomerize into decamers. $LmTDPX1$ is 10-fold less active with $t$-butyl hydroperoxide than either $\mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}_2$ or cumene hydroperoxide, whereas $LmTryP1$ shows no marked substrate preference. The affinity for hydroperoxides is also at least one order of magnitude less for $LmTDPX1$ ($K_{\mathrm{m}} > 200 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$) than $LmTryP1$ ($K_{\mathrm{m}} \leq 11 \, \mu \mathrm{M}$). Like

Comparison of *L. major* trypanothione peroxidases

many 2-Cys peroxiredoxins [32] *LmTryP1* is sensitive  
to inactivation by over-oxidation, an important regulatory mechanism in mammalian cells [31]. In contrast, *LmTDPX1* did not show any sign of  
inactivation by hydroperoxides. Finally, TryPs constitute 1–4% of the total cellular protein and are at least 40-fold more abundant than TDPXs on a  
molar basis such that TDPXs contribute less than 1% to the overall peroxidative capacity in *L. major*. Thus, although TryPs are susceptible to inactivation  
by hydroperoxides, it seems unlikely that TDPXs could form a significant second line of defence against oxidant stress.

Despite the apparent redundancy of function in detoxification of peroxides, both TDPX and TryP are essential in *T. brucei* indicating that they must have additional unique functions [26, 27]. Mammalian mitochondrial GPX4 protects against oxidant-stress induced apoptosis, whereas cytosolic GPX4 suppresses the activation of lipoxygenases and cyclooxygenases involved in inflammation [41] and the *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* homologue (GPx3) is implicated in redox signalling [42]. Further investigations could reveal similar functions for TDPXs in leishmania. The pronounced differences in substrate specificity and mechanism between parasite TDPXs and mammalian GPXs suggest they may be potential drug targets. Gene knock-out studies are required to determine whether this also applies in *L. major*.

### Cloning and site directed mutagenesis

The gene sequences for TDPX1, TDPX2 and TDPX3, TRYP1 and TRYX were identified using the genome database GeneDB (http://www.genedb.org/). The complete ORF of LmjF26.0820 (TDPX1) was amplified by PCR from genomic DNA of *L. major* Friedlin strain using forward primer containing an NdeI site and reverse primer containing a BamHI site (Table 3). The 525 bp PCR-product was digested with NdeI and BamHI and cloned directly into the NdeI/BamHI site of pET-15b (Novagen, Merck Bioscience, Nottingham, UK) to generate plasmid pET15b-TDPX1. In a similar fashion the open reading frames for TRYX (LmjF29.1160) and TRYP1 (LmjF15.1120) were amplified by PCR and cloned into pET-15b (for primers see Table 3). Site directed mutagenesis of TDPX1 was performed using the QuikChange® site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) (for primers see Table 3). All DNA sequences were verified by the Sequencing Service (College of Life Sciences, University of Dundee, UK; http://www.dnaseq.co.uk).

### Expression and purification of *L. major* wild-type TDPX1 and mutants, TryX and TryP1

Competent BL21 (DE3) pLysS (Merck Bioscience) were transformed with the plasmid pET-15b-TDPX1. At an optical density of ~0.5–0.7 the bacteria were induced with 0.4 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside and harvested by centrifugation 4–6 h later. The pellet from 1 L bacteria culture was stored at –80°C.

The pellet was thawed and resuspended in 50 mL buffer A (50 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) supplemented with one Complete Protease Inhibitor tablet (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Indianapolis, IN). The solution was mixed with 25 μg·mL⁻¹ DNase and shaken for 30 min on ice to lyse the cells. After sonication (6 × 30 s on ice) the broken cells were centrifuged for

45 min at 50 000 g at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered sterilized (Steriflip® Millipore Corp., Bedford, MA) and loaded on a 1 mL HisTrap column (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ) previously equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with 50 mL buffer B (buffer A + 20 mM imidazole), 25 mL buffer C (buffer A + 20 mM imidazole, 20% glycerol) and protein eluted with buffer E (buffer A + 250 mM imidazole).

The hexahistidine-tag was removed by incubating pooled fractions with thrombin (1 U per 100 μg of TDPX1 at room temperature for 10 h) and dialyzed against 50 mm Tris/HCl, 20 mm NaCl. Thrombin was removed by incubation with benzamidine beads (Amersham) and any residual His-tagged protein with Ni-NTA beads (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). A further purification step was performed using a 5 mL HiTrap Q HP column (Amersham) and 50 mm Tris/HCl, pH 8.0, 20 mm NaCl as equilibration buffer. The protein was found in the flow through and in the first wash fractions with equilibration buffer. Size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex 75 HR 10/30 column (Amersham) and 50 mm Hepes-NaOH pH 7.4. Gel Filtration Standard (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA) was used as calibration standards.

TryP1 and TryX were expressed and purified on a Ni-NTA matrix column in a similar manner as TDPX1. The only difference was that TryX was expressed at 25 °C after induction overnight. His-tagged proteins were dialyzed against 50 mm Hepes buffer pH 7.4 and stored at –80 °C. His-tags from TryP1 and TryX were removed in a similar manner than from TDPX1. A tenfold amount of thrombin (10 U per 100 μg) was necessary for the complete His-tag removal from TryP1.

Protein concentrations of all the purified proteins were determined at different dilutions from the absorbance at 280 nm using the theoretical extinction coefficients calculated from EXPASY (http://us.expasy.org/tools/protparam.html) assuming all cysteine residues were in the reduced state.

### Analysis of TDPX1, TryP1 and TryX concentrations in *L. major* promastigotes

*L. major* promastigotes (Friedlin strain; WHO designation: MHOM/JL/81/Friedlin) were grown in M199 medium (Caisson Laboratories, Rexburg, ID, USA) with supplements as described earlier [43]. Parasites (2 × 10⁸) were pelleted at 2000 g for 10 min, washed with 5 mL NaCl/Pi buffer and centrifuged again under the same conditions. Finally, parasites were resuspended in 0.4 mL of 50 mm Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 9 M urea, and 0.1% Triton X-100 for determination of protein concentration. For western blot analysis parasites were resuspended in 0.4 mL 2× loading buffer. Parasite mixtures were heated for 10 min at 95 °C. Crude urea lysates were centrifuged (16 000 g, 15 min) and protein content in the supernatants determined by the Bradford protein assay (Bio-Rad) using BSA as standard. *L. major* protein extracts

in loading buffer (3 × 10⁶ parasites for TDPX1 and 1.5 × 10⁶ parasites for TryX and TryP1) were analysed by SDS/PAGE (12% NuPAGE gel; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) with varying amounts of nontagged recombinant TDPX1 (4–20 ng), TryX (4–20 ng) or TryP1 (250–1000 ng) protein included as calibration standards. Cell volumes were determined using a Schärfe CASY cell counter.

Proteins were analysed by western blotting, using a 1 : 500 dilution of the TDPX1 antibody, 1 : 2000 for TryX and 1 : 5000 for TryP1. Polyclonal antisera against recombinant nontagged TDPX1, TryX and TryP (LmjF15.1060) were raised in adult male Wistar rats as described elsewhere [43]. Animal experiments were carried out following local ethical review and under UK regulatory licensing in accordance with the European Communities Council Directive (86/609/EEC). Polyclonal rabbit anti-rat immunoglobulin HRP conjugate (Dako A/S, Carpinteria, CA) in a 1 : 5000 dilution was used as secondary antibody. Finally the proteins were detected using the ECL Plus western blotting detection system (Amersham). The intensity of the protein bands were quantified as absolute integrated optical density using LABWORKS imaging and analysis software (UVP, UK). The resulting data were plotted against the protein concentration and linear regression analysis performed using the software GRAFIT. Results are the means of at least two independent experiments.

#### Enzyme assays

Peroxidase activity of TDPX1 was determined using TryX, glutathione or dithiothreitol as reducing agents.

Tryparedoxin-dependent assays were performed in a volume of 250 μL containing 50 mm Hepes-NaOH pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 3 U·mL⁻¹ *T. cruzi* TryR [44], 100 μM trypanothione disulfide (Bachem, Torrance, CA), 250 μM NADPH, 0.5–5 μM TryX, 0.2 μM TDPX1 and 50–500 μM H₂O₂, 50–2000 μM t-butyl hydroperoxide or 50–1000 μM cumene hydroperoxide, respectively. After 5 min of incubation at 27 °C to allow complete reduction of trypanothione disulfide to trypanothione the background was measured for 2 min by addition of the peroxide to the assay lacking TDPX1. Finally, the reaction was started by addition of TDPX1 and the consumption of NADPH due to a decrease of absorbance at 340 nm was measured with a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2401 PC). The combined data were fitted by nonlinear least squares regression using GRAFIT to the following equation describing a Bi Bi ping-pong mechanism (where A = ROOH and B = TryX):

\[
\nu = \frac{k_{\text{cat}}[E][A][B]}{K_{\text{b}}[A] + K_{\text{a}}[B] + [A][B]}
\]

Glutathione-dependent assays were performed similar to the tryparedoxin-dependent assay in a volume of 250 μL at 27 °C containing 50 mm Hepes, pH 7.4, 1 mm EDTA, 150 μM NADPH, 3 mm GSH, 0.2 U·mL⁻¹ yeast glutathione

reductase (Sigma), 300 μM H₂O₂ and 5 μM TDPX1 wild-type or mutants. Bovine GPX (0.05 U·mL⁻¹; Sigma) was used as positive control. Assays were corrected for non-enzymatic activity.

Dithiothreitol-dependent assays were performed in a volume of 150 μL at 27 °C containing 50 mM Hepes, pH 7.4, 10 mM dithiothreitol and 5 μM wild-type TDPX1, 5 μM C35A–TDPX1 or 0.5 μM C83A–TDPX1, respectively. The reaction was started with 300 μM H₂O₂. At different time points 20 μL samples were added to 1 mL Peroxoquant reagent (Perbio Science, Tattenhall, UK) and residual H₂O₂ quantified colourimetrically at 550 nm with a UV–Vis spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, UV-2401 PC). A calibration curve was performed by adding different amounts of hydrogen peroxide in a 20 μL sample volume directly to 1 mL Peroxoquant reagent. Assays were corrected for nonenzymatic activity.

The kinetic properties of TryP1 were determined using the same conditions as in the TryX-dependent TDPX1 assay. The only differences were that the assays were started with the addition of 50 μM hydroperoxide and TryX concentrations were varied between 2 and 10 μM. The consumption of NADPH in the presence of all components except peroxidase was measured to be 1% of the enzymatic rate and was thus neglected. The data were analysed using the integrated Dalziel rate equation for a two-substrate enzymatic system:

\[
\frac{[E]_0 \cdot t}{[\text{ROH}]_t} = \Phi_1 \frac{\ln([\text{ROOH}] / ([\text{ROOH}] - [\text{ROH}]_t))}{[\text{ROH}]_t} + \frac{\Phi_2}{[\text{TryX}]} + \Phi_0
\]

where,

\[
\Phi_0 = \frac{1}{k_{cat}}; \quad \Phi_1 = \frac{1}{k'_1 [\text{ROOH}]}; \quad \Phi_2 = \frac{1}{k'_2 [\text{TryX}]}
\]

for 10 min. The redox state was fixed by alkylation of any remaining sulfhydryl groups by incubation with 100 mm iodoacetamide in the dark for 30 min. Protein samples (2 μg per lane) were separated by SDS/PAGE in a 12% acrylamide gel and stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. Bands of reduced and oxidized TDPX1 wild-type were excised and digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin and peptides analysed by the Mass Fingerprinting Service (Wellcome Trust Biocentre, University of Dundee, UK).

### Intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence

Wild-type and Cys mutants of TDPX1 (20 μM) were incubated with either 10 mM dithiothreitol or 40 μM H₂O₂ for 5 min. An excitation wavelength of 280 nm was used and the fluorescence emission spectrum was recorded from 300 to 500 nm with a Varian Cary Eclipse fluorescence spectrophotometer. An overlay of 15 spectra is shown.

### Quantitative analysis of sulfhydryl groups

Free sulfhydryl groups in TDPX1 were determined using Nbs₂ [45]. Reduced and oxidized protein was obtained by treatment with 50 mM dithiothreitol or a fivefold excess of hydrogen peroxide, respectively, followed by size-exclusion chromatography (S75 HR 10/30) to remove dithiothreitol or a PD10 Desalting column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) for the removal of hydrogen peroxide. TDPX1 (10 μM) was added to Nbs₂ (2 mM) in 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0 and the absorbance at 412 nm was measured against a 2 mM Nbs₂ solution as reference. The amounts of reactive sulfhydryl groups were determined using ε₄₁₂ = 13 600 M⁻¹·cm⁻¹ [46]. Two independent experiments were performed on triplicate samples.
