Entamoeba histolytica is an enteric dwelling human protozoan parasite that causes the disease amoebiasis, which is endemic in the developing world. Over the past four decades, considerable effort has been made to understand the parasite and the disease. Improved diagnostics can now differentiate pathogenic *E. histolytica* from that of the related but nonpathogenic *Entamoeba dispar*, thus minimizing screening errors. Classically, the triad of Gal-lectin, cysteine proteases and amoebapores of the parasite were thought to be the major proteins involved in the pathogenesis of amoebiasis. However, other amoebic molecules such as lipophosphopeptidoglycan, peroxiredoxin, arginase, and lysine and glutamic acid-rich proteins are also implicated. Recently, the genome of *E. histolytica* has been sequenced, which has widened our scope to study additional virulence factors. *E. histolytica* genome-based approaches have now confirmed the presence of Golgi apparatus-like vesicles and the machinery for glycosylation, thus improving the chances of identifying potential drug targets for chemotherapeutic intervention. Apart from Gal-lectin-based vaccines, promising vaccine targets such as serine-rich *E. histolytica* protein have yielded encouraging results. Considerable efforts have also been made to skew vaccination responses towards appropriate T-helper cell immunity that could augment the efficacy of vaccine candidates under study. Thus, ongoing efforts mining the information made available with the sequencing of the *E. histolytica* genome will no doubt identify and characterize other important potential vaccine/drug targets and lead to effective immunologic strategies for the control of amoebiasis.

The burden caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* infections in developing countries at present is tremendous. Despite the fact that cases of amoebiasis are under-reported in endemic areas, the available information ranks amoebiasis as second only to malaria in mortality due to parasitic infection. It is estimated that *E. histolytica* causes more than 100,000 deaths and is responsible for 50 million cases of diarrhea each year [1]. Disturbingly, children in the developing world are among the most affected. Consequently, an increasing number of initiatives have been set up in order to develop effective preventive treatments against amoebiasis. A vaccine against *E. histolytica* is feasible, as the parasite has a simple life cycle, is antigenically stable and humans are the most important definitive host. However, vaccine development using presently known virulence factors of the parasite has not advanced to clinical trials, despite promising results of preliminary studies. Therefore, it is critical to find additional virulence factors as well as drug targets of *E. histolytica* through careful examination of the recently sequenced amoebic genome [2] and systematic research approaches in the fields of parasite biology and host–parasite interactions. In this postgenomic age, considerable progress has been made in understanding parasite physiology, cell and molecular biology and parasite–host interactions, as well as the epidemiology of amoebiasis. Aptly, the theme of this review is to discuss the postgenomic advances concerning *E. histolytica* and amoebiasis.

## Recent advances in the epidemiology of amoebiasis

Epidemiological studies carried out over the past several years were confronted with the finding of a nonpathogenic, morphologically identical *Entamoeba* species, namely *Entamoeba dispar*. However, improved molecular diagnostics capable of distinguishing *E. histolytica* from *E. dispar* and *Entamoeba moshkovskii* were subsequently developed which minimized screening errors and over-representation [3]. Nonetheless, advanced screening methods employed in recent studies

still reported a higher prevalence of *E. histolytica* in study populations [4,5]. Improved diagnostics also highlights the plight of children in the developing world as well as institutionalized populations who suffer from amoebiasis. An investigation reveals that 80% of preschool children in a slum in Dhaka, Bangladesh suffered at least once from amoebic dysentery [6]. Additionally, the children with *E. histolytica*-associated diarrheal illness were malnourished and were prone to be stunted [7]. A recent study found that two-thirds of patients in mental institutions in Manila, Philippines were positive for *E. histolytica* [8]. Currently, molecular and epidemiological studies are being employed to genotype *E. histolytica* strains based on polymorphisms in the serine-rich *E. histolytica* protein (SREHP) locus, with major emphasis on studying the geographic diversity of the virulent strains [9–11].

Epidemiological studies also underline the importance of host factors in *E. histolytica* infection; in particular, the re-infection rates in a study population have been found to be 2.7-times higher when compared with primary infection rates, which suggests either a short-lived immunity or genetic susceptibility of the host [12]. Similarly, studies that involved screening of serum IgG against *E. histolytica* confirmed that immune responses were clustered in families [13] and currently, protection against *E. histolytica* infection is thought to be genetically linked to HLA class II-restricted immune response. Specifically, the presence of the HLA class II allele DQB1*0601 and the heterozygous haplotype DQB1*0601/DQB1*1501 were correlated with natural resistance to *E. histolytica* infection [14]. These epidemiological data highlight the importance of the genetic make up of the host in the pathogenesis of and resistance to amoebiasis.

### Amoebic pathogenesis in light of recent findings

*E. histolytica* is remarkable in exhibiting two different facets of its life in the gut. On one hand, amoebic trophozoites can remain as a commensal without causing any intestinal pathology, which is observed in the majority of infected individuals. On the other, it can destroy the colonic mucosa and invade soft organs such as the liver, lungs and brain and inflict fatal injuries. The trigger that shifts the parasite from a harmless commensal to a pathogenic phenotype is not clearly known. However, the events that mark the pathogenesis of amoebiasis, which mainly includes amoebic colitis and amoebic liver abscess, are fairly well studied.

As *E. histolytica* colonizes mucin substrates, it is the most important first line of host defense that the parasite must overcome to invade the colonic mucosa. Degradation of proteins and/or oligosaccharide components of the MUC2 polymer (secretory mucin) are thought to be one of the strategies used by *E. histolytica* to weaken and traverse the mucus gel [15]. We have recently shown that cysteine proteases released by *E. histolytica* can effectively cleave the cysteine-rich domains of the MUC2 polymer, which results in depolymerization and subsequent disruption of the mucus gel, allowing the parasite to interact directly with the epithelial surface [16]. *E. histolytica* binds with high affinity to enterocytes through their surface Gal/GalNAc lectin (Gal-lectin) adhesin, which results in killing of the enterocytes by apoptosis (FIGURE 1) [17]. Recent studies also propose that, in addition to the Gal-lectin, lipophosphoglycan (LPPG) and a serine threonine isoleucine-rich protein (EhSTIRP) found on the surface of *E. histolytica* could also be utilized for adhesion and cytotoxicity [18,19].

Following attachment to the enterocytes, *E. histolytica* continues to secrete cysteine proteases, which cause villin lysis and microvilli disruption at the apical surface [20]. Additionally, trophozoites can alter the integrity of the tight junctional complex [21] and transfer antigens such as Gal-lectin and LPPG to the apical side of enterocytes [22]; the significance of this event is not clearly understood, but has been linked to immune evasion. Cleavage of tight junction proteins causes a disruption in the colonic epithelial barrier, which is associated with the characteristic diarrhea observed in patients suffering from amoebic colitis. Subsequently, proinflammatory cytokines released by apoptotic enterocytes cause leukocyte recruitment (FIGURE 1) [23]. However, the amoebic cysteine proteinases, which have previously been demonstrated to cleave immunoglobulins and complement, have also been shown to cleave IL-18 [24], a key pro-inflammatory cytokine required for IFN-γ secretion and macrophage activation.

In order to prevent the parasite from invading the sub-epithelium, the host produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide (NO) in activated resident tissue macrophages (FIGURE 1). To counter this, *E. histolytica* expresses surface peroxiredoxin, which can neutralize both ROS and NO, thus facilitating parasite invasion [25,26]. However, trophozoites are still exposed to degranulation products, such as cathepsin G, released by activated neutrophils,

**Figure 1. Pathogenesis of intestinal amoebiasis.**

(A) In a normal host–parasite relationship *Entamoeba histolytica* thrives on the protective mucus layer without damaging the underlying tissue.

(B) Unknown triggers cause *E. histolytica* to become virulent and release EhCP5, which degrades luminal host defenses by cleaving the cysteine-rich domains of secretory mucin (MUC2), which results in depolymerization of the MUC2 polymer.

(C) Following disruption of the protective mucus gel, the trophozoites continue to release CPs (1), which cleave tight junction proteins (2). Trophozoites attach to the surface of enterocytes (3) via the Gal-lectin and stimulate the release of proinflammatory cytokines: TNF-α, IL-1α, -6 and -8, and GM-CSF. Attachment of the trophozoites to enterocytes results in lysis/apoptosis and release of pro-IL-1β, which is converted to IL-1β by IL-1-converting enzyme activity of *E. histolytica* CPs (4). *E. histolytica* secreted proteins and IL-1β stimulate the release of IL-8 by epithelial cells which attract neutrophils (PMNs) to the site of infection (5). Activated PMNs release high levels of ROS and/or are lysed upon contact with trophozoite. ROS, as well as the released cytotoxic oxidases and lytic proteases of dead PMNs, cause nonspecific tissue damage to bystander cells. PMNs attracted to the site of invasion (6) also release chemokines that attract mφ to aid in host defense (7). Macrophages activated by the Gal-lectin also release NO, ROS and TNF-α, which further amplifies tissue destruction.

which are effectively countered by release of *E. histolytica* serine protease (Ehserp) inhibitors. Ehserp forms a complex with cathepsinG, which neutralizes it, perhaps to promote parasite survival [27]. Additionally, trophozoites can interact with β2 integrins on the surface of neutrophils, which can induce neutrophil apoptosis through PI3K-mediated ROS production [28]. Thus, the parasite effectively counters the defense mechanisms of host neutrophils. Aside from neutrophils, activated macrophages also display a significant defense against amoebic trophozoites through the release of NO. Interestingly, *E. histolytica* consumes the precursor of NO, L-arginine, and converts it into L-ornithine with the help of *E. histolytica* arginase [29]. Thus, *E. histolytica* strategically denies NO precursor to macrophages. Macrophages that are devoid of NO cannot mount an effective defense against invading trophozoites and eventually undergo apoptosis [30]. Finally, *E. histolytica* phagocytoses apoptotic and necrotic cells and initiates systemic invasion, which macroscopically corresponds to the characteristic flask-shaped ulcers in the mucosa of patients with amoebic colitis.

*E. histolytica* infection can, in rare instances, become established in the liver, lung or brain, of which the pathogenesis of amoebic liver abscess (ALA) is most thoroughly studied. Recent findings demonstrate specific activation of those trophozoites that enter systemic circulation and liver. Fibronectin and laminin of endothelial cells, as well as extracellular matrix proteins, interact with β1 integrin-like receptors on the trophozoites and activate them [31]. The pore-forming peptide, amoebapore, and amoebae cysteine proteinase 5 are reported to play a signaling role in the development of ALA [32,33]. Additionally, trophozoites specifically upregulate surface expression of a lysine and glutamic acid-rich protein (KERP1) during ALA formation, which has been proposed as a potential marker in ALA pathogenesis [34]. The important virulence factors involved in amoebic pathogenesis are summarized in TABLE 1.

### Recent developments in our understanding of *E. histolytica* cell biology

Elucidation of the *E. histolytica* genome has revolutionized our understanding of amoeba cellular biology. The notion that *E. histolytica* is a primitive protozoan, which has evolved prior to the acquisition of important cellular organelles, has now been reconsidered due to the evidence of the presence of Golgi apparatus (GA), endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and other orthologous organelles. In fact, components of GA, such as UDP-galactose and UDP-glucose transporters, in addition to constituents of glycosylation machinery of ER, such as protein disulphide isomerases, have been identified in *E. histolytica* and functionally characterized [35,36]. Mitosomes, which are orthologs of mammalian mitochondria, are thought to be nonfunctional in

E. histolytica; however, mitochondrial carrier family components were recently identified in E. histolytica mitosomes [37], suggesting that amoebic mitosomes could function similarly to mitochondria, thus warranting thorough evaluation of this organelle in E. histolytica.

Manifestation of E. histolytica virulence is synonymous with its efficient phagolysosome activity. Therefore, understanding the cellular mechanism of phagocytosis as well as the lysosomal events would aid the identification of phagolysosomal factors that impart amoebic virulence. PI3K-mediated activation of the actin–myosin cytoskeleton is associated with the early events of phagocytosis, which are followed by the recruitment of α-actinin and formins to the phagosomes [38]. EhRab5 and EhRab7A are involved in phagosome maturation, and the former plays an exclusive role in the transport of the amoebapore to the phagosome [39]. However, EhRab7B has been shown to decrease phagocytic efficiency but simultaneously increase the activity of extracellular cysteine proteinases (CPs) [40]. Recently, EhCP112 has been shown to disrupt the epithelial monolayer, cleave extracellular proteins and, together with EhADH112, form an EhCPADH complex that is involved in trophozoite virulence [41].

One of the recent topics of research that fascinates cell biologists is the lipid rafts on the plasma membrane of eukaryotes, which have also been found in E. histolytica [42]. They play an important role in pinocytosis and target cell adhesion and, interestingly, EhLimA, the first LIM domain-containing protein identified in E. histolytica, is thought to connect the amoebic lipid raft with the actin cytoskeleton [43]. Dynamic actin restructuring is required for various intracellular events, and E. histolytica calmodulin-like protein (EhCaBP1) has been found to bind actin filaments and regulate phagocytic and endocytic events [44]. E. histolytica genome surveying has also helped to identify additional amoebapore-like genes belonging to the saposin-like protein family (SAPLIP). In contrast to the amoebapore, a defined representative of the SAPLIP exhibits membrane fusion properties that may aid transport and sorting during endo/exocytosis [45].

E. histolytica has also been shown to express chromatin remodeling machinery required for nuclear transcription, including histone acetyltransferases and deacetylases [46]. A genome-wide screen for transcriptional regulatory sequences identified a distinct promoter motif, A/TAAACCCT, associated with transcription of 68% of trophozoite genes [47] and an upstream regulatory element 3′-binding protein that can negatively regulate the expression of the heavy subunit of Gal–lectin [48]. This suggests amoebic virulence is transcriptionally regulated. Interestingly, E. histolytica lacks machinery to synthesize nucleotides on its own and depends on the host for ready-made purines and pyrimidines. Two secretory nucleases, EhNucI and EhNucII, of trophozoites hydrolyze host nucleic acid strands, thus highlighting the importance of these enzymes in parasite survival [49].

### **E. histolytica interactions with the host: recent advances**

The majority of efforts directed towards delineating the effects of E. histolytica infection on the host immune system were focused on the pathology associated with development of amoebic colitis or liver abscess. However, the details of parasite–host interaction in the absence of invasion, which occurs in 80% cases of amoebiasis [6], have been largely overlooked. Additionally, very limited attention has been devoted to unravelling the protective role of the epithelium in preventing E. histolytica infection. In this regard, we have recently reported that E. histolytica proteins are able to exert a cytoprotective effect on colonic epithelial cells through upregulation of heat-shock protein (Hsp) 72 [50]. Furthermore, it was determined that E. histolytica proteins also lead to the upregulation and phosphorylation of Hsp 27 which, in turn, associates with IkB kinase to inhibit its activity. This leads to the suppression of nuclear factor (NF)-κB activation associated with initiation of an inflammatory response. Usually, suppression of NF-κB activity is correlated with increased rates of apoptosis, but upregulation of Hsp 72 might be able to override the pro-apoptotic signaling associated with NF-κB suppression and promote cell survival. E. histolytica induced epithelial cytoprotection and suppression of inflammation can be construed as a mechanism employed by the parasite for its colonization in the colon (FIGURE 2).

### **E. histolytica-induced immunosuppression**

An increasingly understood strategy used by microorganisms to survive in the host is the induction of regulatory or anti-inflammatory responses [51]. Downregulation of cell-mediated immune responses during E. histolytica infection is proposed to facilitate parasite invasion of the host tissues while avoiding immune detection [52]. A recent study in central Togo, west Africa, demonstrated that patients coinfected with E. histolytica/dispar, Necator americanus and Mansonella perstans had elevated levels of

the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, while the production of proinflammatory IL-12, p40 and IL-5 by peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMN) cells were strongly reduced [53]. Furthermore, the poly-parasitized patients displayed depressed eosinophilic and cytotoxic immune responses, both of which could be explained by the increased levels of IL-10. IL-10 can effectively suppress the immune system and allow infections with multiple species of parasites to occur, while at the same time preventing tissue damage and the resulting pathology.

Similarly, patients in which the amoebic rectocolitis culminated in predominantly necrotic ALA had low proinflammatory eosinophilic activity in the liver, associated with the decreased production of IL-5 (required for differentiation, survival and chemotaxis of eosinophils) and IL-6 (leading stimulator of acute phase proteins in the liver), in addition to decreased production of TNF-α and IFN-γ [54]. In support of this, patients with ALA had elevated levels of CD8⁺ cells, while the presence of CD4⁺ T cells was diminished, which was attributed to elevated levels of IL-10 and its ability to suppress CD4⁺ T-cell proliferation [55]. Conversely, immunopathogenesis of amoebic colitis is exacerbated by acquired CD4⁺ T-cell responses in mice, possibly owing to the

been demonstrated to induce tolerogenic phenotype in DCs, which is associated with increased secretion of IL-10 and TGF-β, inhibition of NF-κB signaling, decreased antigen internalization and processing, decreased expression of co-stimulatory molecules (CD80/CD86), and expansion (or *de novo* generation) of regulatory T cells [61].

The immunosuppressive effects of *E. histolytica* on cells of the immune system has led to identification of a parasite-derived heat-stable anti-inflammatory pentapeptide (Met–Gln–Cys–Asn–Ser), which inhibited locomotion of monocytes and was therefore named monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor (MLIF) [62,63]. Further studies demonstrated that MLIF utilized D-mannose-containing receptors [64] and increased cAMP levels, as well as the number of pericentriolar microtubules in monocytes [65]. MLIF was also capable of suppressing respiratory burst and NO production in human monocytes and PBMN cells, but not eosinophils [66–68], in addition to decreasing expression of adherence molecules (very late antigen-4 and VCAM-1) on monocytes and endothelial cells [69]. MLIF was shown to abrogate phorbol myristate acetate-induced expression of CCL1, -3 and -4, which are required for recruitment of neutrophils, monocytes, macrophages, T cells, NK cells, immature DCs and basophils to the site of inflammation [70]. However, the parent protein from which MLIF is produced through cleavage by a trypsin/serine-type protease [62] has not been identified and it remains to be determined whether MLIF is produced *in vivo* by *E. histolytica* and whether it plays a facilitative role in tissue colonization [70].

Similar to immunosuppression, a phenomenon wherein females are less prone to ALA than males is observed in *E. histolytica* infection. ALA occurs mostly in adults, with a female-to-male ratio of 1:2–1:7, depending on age [71]. A recent study addressed sexual dimorphism in *E. histolytica* infection by employing a mouse model of ALA and demonstrated that female mice were able to resolve amoebic infection much faster than male mice [71]. This was related to significant differences in IL-4 and IFN-γ production in the early stages of the abscess development. Male mice produced elevated levels of IL-4, while female mice NK T cells in the liver produced large quantities of IFN-γ, which was required to activate neutrophils and macrophages to eliminate *E. histolytica* trophozoites *in vivo* [72,73] through upregulation of NO production. Interestingly, a recent report demonstrated that male mice were also more susceptible to amoebic colitis, while

the protection from infection was associated with the presence of B6 loci, but was independent of the levels of colonic MUC2 [74].

### Amoebiasis & HIV-1 infection

Some attention has been given to study the relationship between HIV-1 infection and amoebiasis [75,76] in addition to investigating the ability of *E. histolytica* to act as a vector in HIV-1 transmission [77]. It was demonstrated that HIV-1 infection is not a risk factor for amoebiasis [78], which corroborated earlier findings that *E. histolytica* was able to take up immunologically relevant HIV-1 virus, but was not able to transfer it to uninfected human PBMN cells, even after lysis of the trophozoites [78]. However, the relationship between HIV-1 and invasive *E. histolytica* infections, especially of the liver, has remained underinvestigated, while the incidence of invasive amoebiasis in HIV-seropositive patients in Taiwan and China has increased [79,80]. A recent report has attempted to link the aberrant DC-mediated activation of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> T-regulatory cells in HIV-positive patients with ALA [81]. Exposure of HIV-1-derived Tat protein (required for viral replication and infectivity) to HIV-infective individuals led to modification of DC activity, such that the suppressive activity of regulatory T cells was excessively upregulated, leading to decreased host protection against the invading parasite, thus causing increased susceptibility of HIV-1-positive individuals to invasive amoebiasis [81]. The suppression of Th-2-type responses of regulatory T cells during invasive amoebiasis in HIV-1-infected individuals also correlated with impairment of mucosal IgA production that would further decrease protective mucosal immunity.

### Recent developments towards vaccines against *E. histolytica*

Eradication of amoebiasis through prevention of fecal contamination of food and water is not economically feasible in developing countries at present; therefore, development of an effective vaccine against *E. histolytica* appears to be a more viable alternative [82,83]. The development of a vaccine against *E. histolytica* is highly feasible, as there are no animal reservoirs for *E. histolytica* and humans are the major definitive host for the parasite. However, the development of an effective vaccine is hindered by the lack of a nonhuman primate model of amoebic colitis and rodent models might not be sufficient in predicting vaccine efficacy in humans [83]. There is a precedent for using African grey monkey as an animal

model for immunization with recombinant SREHP [84]. Recently, baboons have been used for vaccine studies as *E. histolytica* can colonize the gut and their immune system functions similar to that of humans [85]. Interestingly, intranasal administration of synthetic peptide vaccine using LC3 epitope of the heavy subunit of Gal-lectin elicited a strong intestinal IgA response in baboons. However, the efficacy of this vaccine against a challenge infection in the colon is yet to be determined. Thus, the use of nonhuman primates as an animal model for testing vaccine against amoebiasis is still in its infancy.

The goal of any vaccination against amoebiasis is to elicit a strong intestinal humoral (IgA) response that would prevent parasite colonization and/or invasion. In accordance with that, a recent study highlights the association of intestinal IgA antibodies specific for the amoebic Gal-lectin epitopes with that of immunity against ALA [86]. Moreover, presence of fecal antilectin IgA in humans is correlated with decreased risk of intestinal re-infection [87]. Similarly, existence of partial immunity to re-infection with *E. histolytica* was associated with the presence of intestinal IgA antibodies specific for the carbohydrate-recognition domain (CRD) of Gal-lectin [6]. The presence of fecal anti-CRD IgA was also associated with more rapid resolution of an existing infection, lowered risk of *E. histolytica*-associated diarrhea and delayed repeat infection although this immunity was relatively short-lived. These findings emphasize the importance of using the Gal-lectin subunit as a major vaccine candidate. Interestingly, a combined intranasal and intraperitoneal vaccination with native Gal-lectin in mice conferred high protection against intestinal amoebiasis [88]. Similarly, intranasal administration of native lectin in gerbils conferred protection against ALA during intrahepatic amoebic challenge [89]. In the aforementioned vaccination studies, vaccination efficacy highly correlated with an intense fecal antilectin IgA response.

The paradigm of ‘T-helper cell response’ is considered very important while developing a vaccine for any disease. Vaccine strategies should cater to the need of eliciting appropriate T-helper cell responses that amplify effective immunity [90]. It was recognized that a Th-1-type response prevailed in gerbils following pharmacological intervention of amoebiasis and that conferred resistance to re-infection [91]. Moreover, analysis of lymphocytes from patients who have recovered from invasive *E. histolytica* infection indicated that in response to amoebic challenge these cells produced Th-1-type cytokines such as IL-2 and IFN-γ [92].

Interestingly, IFN-γ and TNF-α-activated macrophages and neutrophils had amoebicidal activity associated with release of NO [93–96].

To skew the vaccination response towards protective Th-1-type, adjuvants can play a major role. IL-12 is an important stimulating factor that acts on T and NK cells to release IFN-γ required for the initiation of a protective Th-1 response [97]. A subunit of *E. histolytica* Gal-lectin has been shown to stimulate IL-12 production from macrophages, which can act as a natural adjuvant during vaccination to induce Th-1 response [98]. Similarly, Gal-lectin has also been shown to upregulate IL-12 production from DCs [99]. However, the potential of using IL-12 as a natural adjuvant in *E. histolytica* vaccination trials is least explored. Most of the early vaccines tested in animal models were administered in conjunction with Freund’s adjuvant or cholera toxin, the toxicity of which does not allow its use in human vaccines [85, 100]. Therefore, recent vaccine development attempted to use cytosine guanine oligodeoxynucleotide (CpG-ODN) as an alternative, owing to its ability to induce potent immune responses and relatively low toxicity. It this regard, we have recently shown that intranasal immunization with native Gal-lectin alongside CpG-ODN as an adjuvant provoked very strong Th-1 (associated with high levels of IFN-γ) and humoral responses against Gal-lectin (associated with high serum levels of IgG and high levels of IgA in the stool) [89]. Bacterial CpG motifs are recognized by Toll-like receptor 9 in humans, which lead to a nonspecific immune response characterized by expression of Th-1-type cytokines [101–104]. More recently *E. histolytica*-derived DNA has also been shown to activate Toll-like receptor 9 in macrophages similar to that of CpG-ODN, which indicates the potential adjuvant property of amoebic DNA [105]. The vaccine efficacy of selected *E. histolytica* vaccine candidates is assessed in TABLE 2 [32, 88, 89, 98–100, 106–110].

### Conclusion

Research on *E. histolytica* is gaining considerable momentum in light of sequencing of its genome. Newer molecular diagnostics are available to differentiate *E. histolytica* from *E. dispar* at the genetic level, thus minimizing screening errors. Moreover, recent molecular epidemiology of the parasite suggests a remarkable genetic polymorphism among virulent isolates, which has subsequently generated considerable interest in studying the geographic spread of *E. histolytica*. Recent advances in the cell biology of *E. histolytica* have shown the presence of GA and ER-like vesicles, which have not been previously identified

sequence. In coming years, research efforts should focus on understanding the parasite and its fine-scale interactions within the host. One area that is completely neglected is how *E. histolytica* can establish itself in the majority of individuals without any apparent disease. Host genetic susceptibility is another area that needs thorough evaluation. Understanding the mechanisms by which the parasite colonizes mucin substrates and how it can disguise itself from the host immune system needs to be explored. Interestingly, a recent report emphasized the importance of *E. histolytica* rhomboid protease in the immune evasion of the parasite and the potential of it being used as a therapeutic target [111]. Similarly, we need to identify genetically-susceptible populations, which would help us design effective preventative strategies. Genome studies should also help us identify and model newer drug/vaccine targets. Although resistance to metronidazole, the drug most extensively used to treat invasive *E. histolytica*, has not surfaced as a major problem, it is prudent to discover newer drugs to tackle amoebiasis. Gal-lectin has shown promising results as a subunit vaccine in animal models of the disease; however, clinical trials need to be carried out to determine the efficacy of this vaccine. Ideally, the most effective vaccine should be made to inhibit parasite colonization and/or limit or inhibit parasite invasion with long-term memory.

**Executive summary**

**Introduction**
- Amoebiasis caused by *Entamoeba histolytica* is the second leading parasitic cause of human mortality, mainly affecting children of the developing world.
- Recent sequencing of the genome of *E. histolytica* holds the key for improved understanding of the parasite biology and to employ effective intervention schemes.

**Epidemiology**
- Improved diagnostics are now available to differentiate pathogenic *E. histolytica* from the nonpathogenic, *Entamoeba dispar*.
- Genetic polymorphism exists between virulent isolates of *E. histolytica*.
- Recent evidence supports a genetic susceptibility of the host for amoebiasis.

**Pathogenesis**
- The mechanism whereby cysteine proteases of *E. histolytica* break the luminal mucin barrier have been identified.
- Lipophosphopeptidoglycan and serine threonine isoleucine-rich protein are newly identified parasitic adhesion factors that mediate cytotoxicity.
- *E. histolytica* specifically upregulate KERP1 on its surface during pathogenesis of amoebic liver abscess.

**Cell biology**
- There is evidence for the presence of Golgi apparatus and endoplasmic reticulum.
- A distinct promoter motif, A/TAAACCCT, is associated with transcription of 68% of trophozoite genes.

**Immune responses to *E. histolytica* infection**
- *E. histolytica* decreases the host CMI response by upregulating IL-10.
- Parasite-derived prostaglandin E₂ and monocyte locomotion inhibitory factor could suppress the host's immune system.

**Vaccine development**
- A *E. histolytica* Gal-lectin based, simple noninvasive immunization strategy has been formulated so that a maximum vaccine response against amoebiasis in an animal model may be elicited.
- Using IL-12 or cytosine guanine oligodeoxynucleotide as an adjuvant, the vaccination response to *E. histolytica* Gal-lectin is skewed towards protective Th-1-type immunity.

**Future perspective**
- Research efforts should focus on studying the fine-scale interactions between *E. histolytica* and its host, and to better understand host genetic susceptibility to amoebiasis.
- Clinical trials need to be carried out to develop a Gal-lectin-based subunit vaccine.
