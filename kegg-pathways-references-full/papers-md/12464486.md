Summary Mycobacterium tuberculosis has two discrete β-ketoacyl synthases encoded by kasA and kasB that are located in tandem within a five-gene operon that has been implicated in isoniazid-sensitivity and mycolic acid synthesis. We have developed an in vitro meromycolic acid synthase assay to elucidate the anabolic role of these enzymes. Overproduction of KasA and KasB individually and together in M. smegmatis enabled cell-free incorporation of [¹⁴C]malonyl-CoA into lipids whose chain length was dependent upon the M. tuberculosis elongating enzyme used. KasA specifically elongated palmitoyl-CoA to monounsaturated fatty acids that averaged 40 carbons in length. KasB hyperproduction in the presence of KasA produced longer chain multiunsaturated hydrocarbons averaging 54 carbons in length. These products comigrated with a synthetic standard of meromycolic acid and their production was sensitive to isoniazid, thiolactomycin, and triclosan. KasA mutations associated with isoniazid resistance produced an enzyme that had a diminished overall catalytic activity but conferred enhanced resistance to isoniazid. In vivo analysis confirmed that overexpression of each of the four mutant KasAs enhanced isoniazid resistance when compared to overexpression of wild-type KasA. These results suggest discrete anabolic roles for both KasA and KasB in mycolic acid synthesis and substantiate the involvement of KasA mutations in isoniazid resistance. © Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

INTRODUCTION

Mycobacteria have an innate ability to evade host surveillance, resist common antibiotics and rapidly develop resistance to effective chemotherapeutics that is largely attributable to the complex mycobacterial cell wall.¹ Mycolic acids are the primary hydrophobic components of this structure whose organization and chemical properties directly determine the unusually low permeability of *Mycobacterium tuberculosis*.² Mycolic acids are complex lipids produced from the head-to-head condensation of two-component fatty acyl parts. One of these is a long ‘mero’ chain 50–60 carbons in length while the other is a shorter, and less functionalized, fatty acid of 24–26 carbons. Biosynthetic production of these fatty acid constituents likely involves permutations of the same basic anabolic processes as used for the de novo production of plasma membrane lipids such as palmitate.

Historically, the study of the biosynthesis of these complex lipids has been intimately linked to the study of the mechanism of action of isoniazid (INH), which is one of the primary therapeutics used to treat tuberculosis clinically. INH has been shown to specifically inhibit mycolic acid biosynthesis leading to a disruption in the cell wall that impacts viability.³⁻⁸ Because of this effect of INH, all of the biosynthetic enzymes involved are generally considered validated as targets for the development of novel antimycobacterial drugs.³,⁹ Nonetheless, direct biochemical analysis of this important pathway has been hampered by both the complexity and the physical properties of the substrates involved and the large number of biochemical operations that must be catalyzed (there are approximately 114 chemical reactions required

to synthesize a single molecule of α-mycolic acid, not counting transport processes or precursor production).¹ A recent study has addressed the kinetics of the condensation steps in the synthesis of the meromycolic acids.¹⁰ However, the limitation with this study, in terms of the precise role of each of the condensing enzymes (Kas A and Kas B) is the availability of the substrate and the use of short-chain C16, C20 acyl chains as surrogate substrates.

Examination of both differential protein expression and differential gene expression in *M. tuberculosis* treated with INH has focused our attention on a five-gene operon we postulated to be involved in mycolic acid synthesis spanning the genes Rv2243-2247.⁷¹¹ Both the observed transcriptional/translational upregulation and the covalent incorporation of drug into two of the encoded proteins in this operon encouraged us to undertake a close examination of their biochemical functions. All five of the encoded proteins were homologous to proteins known to be components of Type II fatty acid synthase systems.³,¹³,¹⁴

In fatty acid synthesis, extension of a growing fatty acyl chain by two carbons is initiated by the coupling of a malonylated acyl carrier protein (ACP) with a thioester-linked acyl group at the active site of a β-ketoacyl synthase enzyme (KAS). Within the INH-associated gene cluster, there were two tandem KAS-type enzymes, KasA and KasB as well as an ACP, dubbed AcpM.⁷ In general, catalysts for fatty acid synthesis in eukaryotic systems (with the exception of plants) are polyfunctional enzymes, known as Type I fatty acid synthase systems (FAS I), that incorporate both ACP and KAS functions as domains within a single polypeptide.¹⁵,¹⁶ The more primitive Type II systems (FAS II) that occur in bacteria and plants catalyze these steps by discrete polypeptides.¹⁷ Both types of FAS systems have been reported from a single species of mycobacteria, and both are apparent from an inspection of the genome.¹²,¹⁸,¹⁹ The extensive characterization by Bloch and colleagues of fatty acid synthesis in *M. smegmatis* revealed that FAS I alone initiates de novo synthesis of lipids from acetate.²⁰,²¹ This FAS I system has the unusual property of showing a wide range of products that appear bimodal with peaks of acyl chains 16 and 24 carbons in length, a property that has been shown to be shared by the purified enzyme from *M. tuberculosis*.²² In vitro examination of the mycobacterial FAS II system (also called the ACP-dependent system) has shown it, in contrast to be incapable of de novo synthesis; rather, it has unique elongating activity enabling it to extend acyl-CoA primers to longer lipids.¹⁹,²³

To understand the role of the two condensing enzymes that have been implicated in INH sensitivity, as well as to establish and validate assays directed at the other

components of the FAS II system we report here cell-free systems capable of elongation to the level of full-length meromycolic acids.

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

#### Strains and growth conditions

*M. tuberculosis* H37Rv (ATCC 27294) and *M. smegmatis* mc²155 were grown at 37°C with agitation in Middlebrook 7H9 liquid medium containing albumin/dextrose/catalase supplement (ADC) and kanamycin (50 μg/ml) where appropriate. *Escherichia coli* strain DH5α (Life Technologies) was used for cloning and DNA manipulation and grown at 37°C in LB medium with 50 μg/ml kanamycin. [¹⁴C]acetate, [¹⁴C]malonyl-CoA and [¹⁴C]palmitoyl-CoA were from Amersham Life Technologies. In vitro assay reagents were from Sigma. Electro-competent mycobacteria were prepared from an actively growing log-phase culture in 7H9 + ADC (OD600nm of 0.6–0.8) and harvested by centrifugation. The collected cells were washed 5 times in equal amounts of water as the original culture at 4°C. The cells were concentrated 75-fold and 20 μl was used for electroporation.

#### Vectors and constructs

*kasA* and *kasB* were cloned into the mycobacterial shuttle vector pMH29(K) via PCR amplification with PWO DNA polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim, Germany). PCR primers for *kasA* were op5.2 (5′-GCTCTAGAAGGTCCAAATGAGTCAGGCCTTCCA), kasa+3.2 (5′-GCATGTTAACCAAGCCCAGCCGAAGGCAAGCGCC), and *kasB* were op5.3 (5′-GCTCTAGAAGGAGGCCCGAGATGGGGGTCCCCC), op3.3 (5′-GCATGTTAACCAAGTACCGTCCGAAGGCGATTGC). The 5′ primers of each gene have an added Shine-Dalgarno ribosomal binding site and the native start codon GTG has been changed to ATG. Each PCR product was cloned directly into the mycobacterial expression vector pMH29(K) using the engineered restriction sites XbaI and HpaI. The 2.6 kb *kasA/B* fragment was cloned by PCR using op5.2 and op3.3 into pMH29(k) in an analogous fashion. Mutant KasA proteins were expressed following PCR amplification from DNA supplied by J. M. Musser from a collection of recent clinical isolates that has been previously described.⁷ Each mutant gene was PCR-amplified and cloned by the same method as described above into pMH29(K). The protein from strain HN113 has a coding sequence alteration at position 66 which results in a change from aspartic acid to asparagine, strain HN335 has a change at position 269 resulting in the substitution of glycine for serine, strain TB029 has an alteration at position 312 that also results in a glycine to serine change and strain HN93 has a change

at position 413 resulting in a phenylalanine to leucine amino acid change. The complete sequence of the mutant and wild-type clones in pMH29 was verified by sequencing both strands on each construct used and the only mutations identified were those previously identified in the KasA encoding sequence.

### Cell-free assay for ketoacyl synthase activity

Cell lysates were prepared from 200 ml of *M. smegmatis* cells containing the appropriate genetic constructs grown to an OD<sub>650nm</sub> of 0.6–0.8. The cells were harvested, centrifuged and the resulting pellets were washed 2 times in 4°C PBS, pH 7.0. Cells were resuspended in 10 ml of 4°C breakage buffer (0.1 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.0) and allowed to stand on ice for an additional 10 min. Breakage was achieved by sonic disruption with 30-s bursts and 60-s delay intervals for a total breakage time of 4 min in a salt-water ice bath. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifuging twice for 15 min at 12,000 g, which afforded the final enzymatic preparation. The standard reactions were performed at pH 8.5 based upon optimization results by adding 200 μl of 0.5 M tricine buffer pH 9.0 containing all the cofactors to 800 μl of enzymatic preparation at ~2 mg/ml protein concentration determined by a BCA protein assay (Biorad). The KAS assay standard reaction mixture was 0.1 mM NADPH, 0.1 mM NADH, 0.2 mM palmitoyl-CoA, 500 mM α-cyclodextrin, 150 μg ACP (*E. coli*, Sigma) and 1 μCi of either [¹⁴C]acetate, [¹⁴C]malonyl-CoA or [¹⁴C]palmitoyl-CoA. The final volume of the reaction was 1000 μl after the addition of the cellular lysate. The total protein content was controlled by monitoring the preparation at three stages: (1) the OD<sub>600nm</sub> and volume of each culture, (2) the wet weight of the pellet resulting from the clarification spin and (3) protein content as assayed postreaction. All of the preparations were considered the same if the criteria for each were within 5%. Each enzymatic reaction was allowed to proceed at 37°C. In the case of drug inhibition studies, the enzyme extracts were treated with drug for 60 min at 37°C before the addition of [¹⁴C]malonyl CoA. Each drug was supplied at 100 μg/ml unless otherwise specified. Upon completion the reactions were stopped by the addition of 1 ml 20% tetrabutylammonium hydroxide and the saponification was then conducted at 120°C for 12 h. This mixture was then cooled to room temperature and methyl-esterified by the addition of an equal volume of CH<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub> containing 50 μl of iodomethane (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The organic layer was recovered and dried under a stream of air. The [¹⁴C]methyl esters were recovered from the salt residue by extraction with ether and analyzed either by C18 reversed-phase thin layer chromatography (TLC) (Whatman) or by C18 reversed-phase HPLC as described previously.<sup>24</sup> Reversed-phase

TLC analysis was performed with 50% acetonitrile in dioxane as mobile phase on C18 silica gel 60A with a single development. Visualization was achieved by radioactive detection with phosphorimaging. HPLC analysis was performed on a C18 reversed-phase column with the following gradient of acetonitrile to dioxane: 0–2 min 100% acetonitrile; 2–52 min linear gradient to 100% dioxane; 52–62 min 100% dioxane. HPLC radiodetection was done using a β-Ram inline scintillation detector (IN/US Systems Inc, Tampa, FL, USA). The column and detector were calibrated with a meromycolic acid standard prepared as described previously from *M. smegmatis* metabolically labeled with [¹⁴C] acetate until OD<sub>600nm</sub> 1.2.<sup>24</sup>

#### Hydrogenation of in vitro generated fatty acids

Total [¹⁴C]-fatty acid methyl esters produced were recovered from KAS assay mixtures by extraction with 6 ml CHCl<sub>3</sub>:CH<sub>3</sub>OH (1:1) to result in a final ratio of CHCl<sub>3</sub>:CH<sub>3</sub>OH:H<sub>2</sub>O (1:1:0.3). The extract was split and half was dried under a stream of air and resuspended in 5 ml CH<sub>3</sub>OH and subjected to catalytic hydrogenation for 12 h using 10 mg palladium catalyst on charcoal (palladium black, Sigma) under hydrogen gas. The resulting reduced fatty acids were recovered and analyzed by C18 reversed-phase HPLC along with the original extract as described.

#### Isoniazid activation assay

Twenty milliliters of each *M. smegmatis* recombinant strain was grown to OD<sub>600nm</sub> of 0.6 and collected by centrifugation at 12,000 g for 10 min. The resulting cellular pellets were resuspended in 1 ml of PBS pH 7.0 containing 1 μCi [¹⁴C]-isoniazid. The reaction was stopped after 180 min by the addition of 1 ml 0.13 M hydroxylamine adjusted to pH 6.8 and the cells were subject to bead-beating 3 times for 30 s allowing 90 s cooling intervals. The resulting crude homogenate was centrifuged for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge and 50 μl of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed by TLC on silica gel with 10% CH<sub>3</sub>OH in CHCl<sub>3</sub> as the mobile phase. INH activation was extrapolated from the conversion of [¹⁴C]-isoniazid to [¹⁴C]-4-pyridylmethanol as detected and quantitated on a phosphorimager.<sup>25</sup>

#### Other in vitro analyses

The effect of pH on the synthesis of long-chain lipids was determined by generating the enzymatic lysate in 0.1 M KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> pH 7.0 reaction buffer as described above and adding additional buffer to obtain a range from 5.0 to 9.0. A pH of 5 was achieved by the addition of 200 μl of 0.5 M Bis-Tris, pH 4.0. A pH of 5.5 was achieved by the addition

of 200µl of 0.5M Bis-Tris, pH 5.0. A pH of 6.2 was achieved by the addition of 100µl of 0.5M Bis-Tris, pH 5.0. A pH of 7 was achieved by the addition of 200µl of 0.5M KH₂PO₄, pH 7.0. A pH of 7.8 was achieved by the addition of 100 µl of 0.5 M Tricine at pH 9.0. A pH 8.5 of was achieved by the addition of 200 µl of 0.5 M Tricine at pH 9.0. A pH of 9.0 was achieved by the addition of 200 µl of 0.5 M Tricine at pH 10.0. The effect of detergents was addressed by performing the reaction at pH 8.5 using either 2.5, 5.0, 10.0 mg/ml BSA, 125, 250, 500 mM α-cyclodextrin or 10.95 mg/ml (1.5 × CMC), 21.9 mg/ml (3.0 × CMC), 43.8 mg/ml (6.0 × CMC) n-octyl β-D-glucopyranoside final concentration. Substrate specificity was determined using 1 µCi of either [¹⁴C] acetate, [¹⁴C] malonyl-CoA or [¹⁴C] palmitoyl-CoA at pH 8.5. Substrate competition assays were performed with 50 µM acetate, 50 µM malonyl-CoA, or 50 µM palmitoyl-CoA. Cofactor effects on KAS activity were determined by adding 50, 100, 150 µg/ml ACP (*E. coli*, Sigma) or 1, 10, 50 µM coenzyme-A (Sigma) to the standard reaction assay conditions described above.

### In vitro activity of KasA

We developed in vitro assay conditions guided by previous studies on fatty acid biosynthesis by the Type II FAS system of *M. smegmatis* by Bloch and colleagues²³ and on studies of long-chain fatty acid synthetic activity in clarified lysates of *M. tuberculosis* by Takayama and coworkers.²⁶ Block and coworkers showed that an ACP-dependent, FAS II activity of this mycobacterium was capable of elongating various primers (malonyl-CoA, palmitoyl-CoA) to acyl chains up to 30 carbons in length with a peak in activity at about 24 carbons. Takayama and coworkers showed that extracts of tubercle bacillus were capable of incorporating label from malonyl-CoA into very long chain lipids. Using similar reaction components and cell-free extracts derived from clarified wild-type *M. smegmatis* lysates, we were able to reproduce low levels of incorporation of label from [¹⁴C] malonyl-CoA into tetracosanoate and longer fatty acids as previously reported (Fig. 1A). When identical extracts were prepared from the KasA hyperproducing *M. smegmatis* strain and then incubated with [¹⁴C] malonyl-CoA with unlabeled palmitoyl-CoA primer a significantly different profile was observed by reversed-phase radioHPLC (Fig. 1B). The products from such assays were a complex series of fatty acids composed of at least two homologous methylenic series that peaked with members having a retention time of 36 min. The total number of counts incorporated into long-chain lipids from extracts of KasA-overproducing strains was reproducibly much higher than that incorporated by extracts from control vector containing strains.

Calibration of this HPLC system with commercial fatty acid methyl esters allowed us to estimate that such retention times would be associated with lipids of 38–42 carbons. However, the acyl products of KasA hyperproducing *M. smegmatis* did not precisely coelute with saturated standards. Takayama and colleagues have previously shown that some of the in vitro reaction products from *M. tuberculosis* lysates were unsaturated by the separation of saturated and unsaturated lipids on normal-phase silica gel. To examine whether the products of the *M. smegmatis* lysate with overexpressed KasA were also unsaturated, we catalytically hydrogenated the crude reaction products and then separated the resulting fully saturated lipids by HPLC (Fig. 2). Consistent with previous reports that unsaturated fatty acids elute more quickly from reversed-phase HPLC, hydrogenation results in a series of fatty acids with longer retention

### In vivo susceptibility testing of INH

Recombinant *M. tuberculosis* strains containing the shuttle vector pMH29 alone, pMH29 carrying wild-type *kasA* or a *kasA* mutant were grown to an OD₆₅₀ₙₘ of 0.4–0.6 and diluted to OD₆₅₀ₙₘ 0.05. Ten microliters of diluted bacteria were plated on increasing concentrations of INH (0.0125, 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.1, 0.125, 0.15, 0.175, 0.2, 0.25, 0.3, 0.4 µg/ml) and the plates were allowed to dry for 2 h before incubating for 4 weeks at which time the endpoint MIC was determined visually by the lack of visible growth at the indicated concentration.

### RESULTS

#### Hyperproduction of *M. tuberculosis* β-ketoacyl synthases

To assess the role of the two KASs in mycolic acid biosynthesis, each one was PCR amplified either separately or in tandem from *M. tuberculosis* H37Rv chromosomal DNA and cloned into the shuttle vector pMH29(k) which contains a strong mycobacterial promoter upstream of the polylinker.⁴ The sequence veracity of each construct was confirmed by redundantly sequencing both strands. In each construct, the translation initiating wild-type GTG was mutated to ATG and an artificial ribosome-binding site was added to improve expression. Efficient expression of each of these proteins in *M. smegmatis* was achieved (a 45 kDa protein produced by the recombinant bacteria, the predicted mass of KasA is 43.3 kDa and that of KasB is 46.4 kDa), and the identity

times whose length could then be accurately assessed by comparison with commercial standards. These results demonstrate that KasA possesses an extension activity that peaks at 40 carbons in length and suggests that KasA is capable of utilizing unsaturated primers for β-ketoacyl extension.

KAS of *E. coli* suggested that, unlike chain-length factors, KasB had all of the essential conserved residues of catalytically active KASs and was therefore unlikely to function solely to modulate the activity of KasA. To assess whether KasB had KasA-independent catalytic function we also hyperexpressed KasB alone in *M. smegmatis*. Such strains failed to produce unique alterations in the fatty acid profiles compared to wild type (data not shown). We reasoned that low endogenous levels of the long-chain acyl-ACP precursors produced by KasA might limit observable KasB activity. We therefore examined the products of palmitoyl-CoA elongation by incorporation of label from \[^{14}C\]malonyl-CoA from a strain producing both KasB and KasA on the same plasmid. Analysis by C18 reversed-phase radioHPLC of labeled fatty acids revealed that some of the resulting complex acyl products possessed a similar retention time as a synthetic meromycolic acid standard (cf. Fig. 1C and 1D). The complexity of the fatty acids synthesized suggested that these products were composed of several overlapping methylenic series of mono- and diunsaturated acids. This result is consistent with the known introduction of a second site of unsaturation at ω-36 and our previous report of concurrent extension and functionalization of the meromycolic acid chain.²⁴

### Substrate specificity and assay optimization

To characterize the primer specificity and optimize long-chain fatty acid production, a variety of conditions were investigated. Substrate specificity was studied with all three constructs, KasA, KasB and KasA/B. In these studies \[^{14}C\]acetate, \[^{14}C\]malonyl-CoA and \[^{14}C\]palmityl-CoA were tested. In the case of \[^{14}C\]acetate and \[^{14}C\]mal-

onoyl-CoA experiments, unlabeled palmitoyl-CoA was supplied as a primer for the reaction, and for \[^{14}C\]palmitoyl-CoA reactions, unlabeled malonyl-CoA was included as the activated two-carbon donor. There was no detectable radioactive incorporation into fatty acids when \[^{14}C\]acetate was used as the substrate with unlabeled malonyl-CoA (Data not shown). Although \[^{14}C\]palmitoyl-CoA served as a substrate for the reaction, the best radioactive incorporation was achieved with \[^{14}C\]malonyl-CoA as the substrate. This may simply be a result of the enhanced radioactive incorporation of \[^{14}C\] by the repetitive addition afforded by using malonyl-CoA rather than a single labeled carbon atom from palmitoyl-CoA. Inclusion of unlabeled acetate in the reaction mixture with labeled malonyl-CoA resulted in the inhibition of activity while inclusion of palmitoyl-CoA stimulated activity 7.5-fold (Fig. 3A). Additional malonyl-CoA also resulted in enhanced activity, suggesting that the concentration of radioactive substrate was below the \(K_m\) for this substrate. These results support a model in which the primary activity under investigation involves priming of KasA with palmitate via the CoA ester with subsequent elongation by sequential addition of malonate.

A pH range of 5–9 was examined and it was apparent that the activity for the synthesis of fatty acids longer than C26 was most robust at pH 8.5 (Fig. 3B). This may be related to the physical properties of the extremely long acyl-ACP products formed and the need to dissociate these proteolipids following each round of catalysis. Surprisingly, non-ionic detergents such as *n*-octyl-β-d-glucopyranoside had no positive effect. However α-cyclodextrin did exhibit a pronounced stimulatory effect. Although the ACP from *E. coli* has limited sequence homology to AcpM (25.9%), the presumed physiologically

relevant ACP for the KasA/B reaction, nonetheless, had a  
stimulatory effect on KasA/B activity. However, the  
addition of coenzyme-A did not result in a stimulation  
of activity (Fig. 3A).

Inhibition of in vitro KAS activity by known FAS II inhibitors

Thiolactomycin (TLM) has been shown to inhibit KasA  
activity^{4,28,29} and triclosan (TRC) has been shown to  
inhibit InhA.^{4,30–35} To demonstrate the utility of the in  
vitro system for assessing inhibitors of mycolic acid  
synthesis, we examined the consequences of preincubation  
with an inhibitory concentration of each substance  
on the overall activity of the in vitro system. Although the  
rate of inactivation by each drug was different, each FAS II  
inhibitor blocked the incorporation of \[^{14}\text{C}\]malonyl-CoA  
by KasA/B into fatty acids (Fig. 4).

The presence of FAS I in the system makes determining  
the preferred substrate of KasA activity difficult in the  
fatty acid range between C16 and C26. Cerulenin (CER), a  
known FAS I inhibitor,^{36–39} was also included in the study  
to determine the role of the endogenous FAS I activity on  
the system. Although CER has been shown to inhibit  
both FAS I and the KAS component of the FAS II system,  
preferential inactivation of FAS I would eliminate the  
influence of FAS I activity on the system.^{40} It is clear that  
KasA is responsible for all elongation activity beyond  
C26, but previous work suggests that FAS I also has  
elongating activity to C26. When the KasA/B hyperexpressing  
clarified *M. smegmatis* enzymatic preparation is  
preincubated with 100 μg/ml CER radioactive incorporation  
into meromycolic fatty acids is unhindered. However, the  
incorporation of label into C16 and C18 fatty  
acids is drastically diminished. This supports the notion  
that C16 and C18 fatty acids are primarily produced by  
the FAS I synthetic activity (Fig. 4A). CER treatment also  
results in the accumulation of 20 and 22 carbon products  
suggesting that a CER-independent activity is capable of  
extending residual FAS I products by several rounds of  
elongation.

INH, TRC and TLM were also used in combination with  
CER to evaluate whether KasA can elongate preformed  
intermediates and to determine further the specific  
inhibitory nature of INH in the in vitro assay. When  
INH and TLM were used in combination with CER, there  
was very little radioactive incorporation (>91% inhibition)  
(Fig. 4B). There appear to be short acyl products  
formed in this double-inhibitor study that migrate somewhat  
more quickly than the 18 carbon standard that  
might perhaps be β-ketoacyl products of a single round of  
elongation. This suggests that KasA may begin mycolate  
synthesis in this system predominantly utilizing palmityl  
primers. It also suggests that FAS I activity can  
provide various short-chain acyl intermediates at lengths  
ranging from C16 to C24. However, the primary fatty acid  
product of FAS I (under these assay conditions) appeared  
to be C18 based on inhibition by CER alone. In contrast,  
when TRC was used in combination with CER, radioactive  
incorporation could still be detected in fatty acids  
from C16 to C26 (Fig. 4B). This may represent partial  
inhibition of the Type II system but this concentration of  
TRC should be sufficient to completely oblate InhA  
activity.^{33} The origin of the acyl products of TRC and  
CER inhibited syntheses remains unclear but the mode of  
action of INH appears to more closely resemble that of  
TLM than that of TRC.^{4}

### In vitro resistance of KasA mutants to INH

The effect of INH on KasA-associated fatty acid production was examined at various drug concentrations. Upon analysis by C18 reversed-phase HPLC, it was evident that INH inhibited KasA-mediated chain extension (Fig. 5). When KasA was treated with INH activity was inhibited 41% and 79% at 10 and 100 μg/ml, respectively, and INH at 200 μg/ml completely abolished KasA activity (Table 1). Although these concentrations are high, KatG-mediated INH activation is significantly lower in *M. smegmatis* (data not shown).^4^

KasA structural mutations have been discovered in a number of clinical isolates suggesting that such mutations contribute directly to INH resistance.^7^ Three of the four mutations previously described map to the putative active site region of the enzyme while the fourth maps to the proposed dimer-interface region. We cloned all four known mutant *kasA* alleles by PCR amplification and expressed them in the same vector system as the wild-type enzyme in *M. smegmatis*. When clarified lysates from these KasA mutants were tested for in vitro synthetic activity in the presence of increasing concentrations of INH, it became clear that the mutants maintained catalytic activity at INH levels much higher than wild-type enzyme (Table 1). However, the maximal KasA activity for the individual mutants without INH present was in the range 56–71% compared to wild type. This suggests a cost to the organism in enzymatic efficiency in exchange for the acquisition of drug resistance.

To assess the role of KasA mutations in vivo, the overexpression constructs were transformed into *M. tuberculosis* and the INH sensitivities of the resulting recombinant organisms were assessed. Strains containing each mutant KasA allele in pMH29 were directly compared to a strain containing only pMH29. MICs were determined in both solid and liquid media following 3 weeks incubation in the presence of INH. The MIC for INH in the *M. tuberculosis* strain containing the empty vector was 0.025 μg/ml. As we have reported previously, the *M. tuberculosis* strain carrying the vector encoding the wild-type KasA showed an MIC of 0.125 μg/ml corresponding to a 5-fold increase in MIC for INH.^4^ The mutant *kasA* alleles all conferred an increased MIC for INH on the recombinant organism. KasA with D66N and G312S had an MIC of 0.3 μg/ml INH, KasA with G269S and F413L had MICs of 0.2 and 0.25 μg/ml INH, respectively (Table 2). These strains showed a corresponding increase in resistance to TLM, further substantiating the mechanistic linkage between INH and TLM, but showed very little enhancement in resistance to TRC.

#### DISCUSSION

Consistent with previous studies of in vitro synthesis of long-chain fatty and mycolic acids in mycobacteria, our studies support the idea that the ACP-dependent Type II FAS system does not perform de novo synthesis of either mycolic or fatty acids from acetate, and therefore does not

que has allowed us to identify the final chain lengths achieved by KasA extension and to demonstrate that KasA elongates unsaturated acyl primers. This further substantiates our previous findings that meromycolate synthesis and modification occur in parallel as shown by the cell-free methyltransferase reactions catalyzed by enzymes of the cyclopropane mycolic acid synthase family.²⁴

KasB appears to have no independent catalytic function in this system but when coexpressed with KasA, it appears to be capable of facilitating the production of lipids of the length of full meromycolic acids. KasB therefore may accept primers directly from KasA that average 40 carbons in length. KasA and KasB thus function in tandem to carry out acyl chain elongation to achieve meromycolic acid synthesis from acyl primers provided by FAS I (Fig. 6).

When the primary amino acid sequence of the KAS from *E. coli* is compared to KasA and KasB, it is clear that the active site residues which lie in the carboxyl half of the KAS are highly conserved. The amino terminal portions of all three KASs differ significantly in apparent proportion to the length of fatty acyl chain substrate they act upon. Thus, the KAS of *E. coli* is the shortest of the three, KasA is second and KasB is the longest. The molecular rationale for this observation does not appear obvious from the structure of the *E. coli* enzyme. Interestingly, each KAS appears to catalyze 7–8 rounds of repetitive condensation reactions, which may be dictated primarily by active site geometric limitations as determined by amino acid sequence, but the variation in N-terminus correlates with the apparent primer length. With regard to meromycolate modification KasA catalyzes 7–8 condensation steps from 16–24 carbon-saturated precursors during which time a desaturation event occurs resulting in the introduction of the distal olefin. The growing acyl chain is then further extended via KasB

activity, which catalyzes another 7–8 condensations to afford the full-length mero-fatty acid. During or following this latter cycle of elongation reactions, an additional unsaturation is introduced as well as other methyl or methylene groups as appropriate for the series.

KAS enzymes are a part of a structurally related family of condensing proteins that includes polyketide synthases, which produce complex molecules such as macrolide and tetracycline antibiotics.²⁷,⁴²,⁴³ Two KASs located in tandem in a single operon is unique to this mycobacterial FAS locus. However, in aromatic PKS systems, clustering of an ACP–KAS to an adjacent coding region, encoding a protein highly homologous to the KAS is more typical.⁴⁴ Although the precise role of the second KAS-like coding sequence is generally unknown, they have been proposed to modulate the chain length of the product formed. Although these ‘chain-length factors’ are required for synthesis, they do not contain the conserved essential amino acid residues required for catalytic activity. Unlike these systems, KasA and KasB appear to contain all of the essential conserved residues required for catalytic activity.

There have been numerous reports on the existence of a particulate enzyme system referred to as P60 which possesses the complete range of enzymatic activities required for de novo synthesis of mycolic acids.⁴⁵⁻⁵⁰ This activity was determined to be specific for acetate and incapable of incorporation of malonate or any acyl-CoA substrate. The atypical precursor requirement for fatty acid synthesis and recent data suggest that this system may not be limited to a cell-free particulate fraction of the bacillus.⁵¹ Other condensing enzymes uniformly require the activated C₂ precursor malonyl-CoA for activity. We have examined the soluble enzymatic fraction for the ability to incorporate acetate into fatty or mycolic acids with very little success. Even considering that both FAS I and FAS II are present in the particulate system, the requirement for acetate as the precursor of malonyl-CoA is extremely unusual and suggests that this requirement is due to the necessity to penetrate intact cells. In addition, the amount of radioactivity required to measure incorporation into long-chain fatty acids suggests that this system is simply a permeabilized whole-cell system.

Mutations in KasA have been identified in isolates from patients infected by INH-resistant strains of *M. tuberculosis*.⁷ When the four mutations were analyzed by molecular modeling, three of them cluster near the active site as determined by comparison with the known crystal structure of the *E. coli* KAS.⁵² Both the mutations at 269 and 312 change a small aliphatic glycine residue to serine with an aliphatic hydroxyl side-chain. Since the catalytic environment is dominantly hydrophobic to accommodate binding of the acyl chain, the addition of two hydroxyl side-chains along the substrate protein interface

could be expected to lead to a less stable interaction. In addition, the mutation at 312 is next to a histidine, which has been shown to be in close vicinity to the side-chain of the nucleophilic cysteine with distances estimated at 4.6Å. The mutation at residue 413 which results in a change from a bulky aromatic amino acid of phenylalanine to the smaller aliphatic amino acid leucine may also influence the active pocket. A phenylalanine in this region may protect the end of the enzymatic cleft of the nucleophilic cysteine and modulate the overall dimensions of the active site. The one mutation not localized to the active site is present in an area of the protein that has been proposed to lie near the dimer-interaction surface. All four of these mutations are conserved in Type II KASs, therefore, suggesting that they play a role in the enzymatic function.

The development of the in vitro assay for meromycolate synthesis has allowed us to address the important question about the involvement of KasA and KasA mutants in INH resistance. When the activity of each mutant is compared to wild type, it is clear that the mutation has a detrimental effect on activity because none of the mutant KasA proteins can produce mycolic acid precursors to the same extent as the wild-type KasA. Although INH inhibits the mutants in a dose-dependent fashion, it is clear that they provide significant resistance compared to wild type. To further examine if KasA is a target for INH and if the KasA mutants contribute to resistance they were examined in vivo in *M. tuberculosis*. A 4–5-fold increase in MIC for INH was observed when the KasA hyperproducing strain of *M. tuberculosis* was compared to *M. tuberculosis* with vector alone. *M. tuberculosis* strains overproducing the mutant KasA proteins resulted in additional enhanced resistance to INH. Although the increase in MIC for each mutant KasA was modest it is arguably sufficient to provide relief during the treatment of infection with INH given the serum characteristics of INH, such as a short half-life.⁹ Mutations in KasA may result in an increase in MIC because of a combination of two factors: (1) the mutations lead to a decreased susceptibility of the enzyme to the activated INH adduct, and (2) the lower catalytic efficiency results in a high constitutive expression level thus leading to a comparative titration of the activated drug.

This in vitro system for chain elongation has already provided valuable clues regarding the role of KasA mutation in INH resistance and offers a step forward in reproducing in precise detail the full sequence of enzymatic steps involved in the Type II FAS system responsible for mycolic acid synthesis in *M. tuberculosis*. This system is important not only as a tool for dissecting the mode of action of known antituberculars but also for uncovering inhibitors of other parts of this vulnerable

and unique system to aid in the identification of novel
inhibitors and candidates for preclinical development.
