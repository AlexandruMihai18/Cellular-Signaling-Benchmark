## Background:

Microsatellite instability (MSI) causes hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), and occurs in about 15 per cent of sporadic colorectal cancers. Although the basic mechanisms are not clear, there is increased understanding of the clinicopathological consequences of MSI.

## Methods:

Medline was searched for articles with a combination of keywords relating to MSI in colorectal cancer, focusing on molecular mechanisms, clinicopathological implications, and prognostic and predictive value. Emphasis was placed on articles from the past 5 years.

## Results:

The genetic mechanisms differ in hereditary (germline mutation) and sporadic (epigenetic silencing) colorectal cancer. The MSI pathway frequently has altered *transforming growth factor β receptor II* and *BAX* genes, often *β-catenin*, and occasionally *p16INK4A* and *PTEN*. Changes in *K-ras*, *adenomatous polyposis coli* and *p53* are rare. Polymerase chain reaction testing for MSI is superior to immunohistochemistry, but complicated by the number and types of nucleotide markers. The Bethesda panel guides HNPCC testing, but guidelines are lacking for general screening. The presence and role of low-frequency MSI remains controversial. Tumours with MSI tend to occur in the proximal colon and be large, but they have a good prognosis. Their reduced response to adjuvant chemotherapy requires confirmation.

## Conclusion:

Research on colorectal cancer needs to be stratified according to microsatellite status in order further to explore the molecular mechanisms and clinicopathological consequences of MSI.

## Introduction

Every year, nearly one million people worldwide develop colorectal cancer, of whom about 50 per cent die within 5 years${}^{1}$. Colorectal cancer develops either sporadically (85 per cent), or as part of a hereditary cancer syndrome (less than 10 per cent), or against a background of inflammatory bowel disease. It is believed that the adenoma–carcinoma sequence underlies the development of colorectal cancer in most patients, and two distinct pathways have been identified – the microsatellite instability (MSI) and the chromosomal instability (CIN) pathways${}^{2-6}$. Discovery of these two pathways has led to the paradigm of colorectal cancer as a genetically heterogeneous disease${}^{2,5,7}$. Colorectal cancer with MSI has a better prognosis than stage-matched microsatellite-stable cancer${}^{8-12}$. Genomic and transcriptomic differences exist between microsatellite unstable and stable colorectal cancers. Some of these differences may be used as diagnostic, predictive or prognostic markers${}^{10,13-16}$. This review explores current concepts and controversies pertaining to MSI in colorectal carcinogenesis.

### Colorectal carcinogenesis

The development of colorectal cancer from an adenoma to a carcinoma may take several decades. Cancer is the result of an accumulation of genetic alterations that allows growth of neoplastic cells with phenotypic characteristics: self-sufficiency in growth signals, insensitivity to antigrowth signals, evasion of apoptosis, limitless replicative potential, sustained angiogenesis, and the ability to invade tissues and metastasize${}^{17,18}$.

The multigene, clonal evolution and selection model of initiation and progression of colorectal cancer proposed by Fearon and Vogelstein${}^{19}$ originally identified the

adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) gene, genes on 18q, and the K-ras and p53 genes as those in which mutations contribute to the evolution of colorectal cancer (Table 1). Although confirmed by later studies, many additional genes are also involved^{19-24}. However, rather than representing a linear model of required accumulative mutations in the APC, K-ras and p53 genes (fewer than 10 per cent of all colorectal cancers have all mutations), recent studies suggest they may each represent alternative, multiple, mutational pathways for colorectal cancerogenesis^{25}, with specific associated chromosomal aberrations^{26} and distinct clinical outcomes^{27}. Nonetheless, knowledge derived from families with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC) has helped establish the early model of colorectal carcinogenesis^{19,21}. Hereditary syndromes have germline mutations in specific genes (mutation in the tumour suppressor gene APC on chromosome 5q in FAP, mutated DNA mismatch repair genes in HNPCC) that greatly increase the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer (more than 80 per cent in HNPCC) compared with the general population.

Sporadic colorectal cancer develops through randomly acquired somatic mutations in several of the genes affected

of genetic alterations found in most human cancers²⁸. For this reason, it has been suggested that destabilization of the genome may be a prerequisite early in carcinogenesis²⁹. This ‘mutator phenotype’ is best understood in colorectal cancer, in which there are two separate destabilizing pathways (*Fig. 1*).

The most common genetic pathway (approximately 85 per cent of colorectal cancers) is characterized by allelic losses, chromosomal amplifications and translocations⁴⁻⁶,₂₁,₃₀⁻³⁶. Deletion at 1p and 8p, as well as loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 17p and 18q, are frequent in colorectal cancer. Such alterations are characteristic of the CIN pathway, also referred to as the microsatellite stability pathway. The second pathway (involving about 15 per cent of sporadic colorectal cancers) is referred to as the MSI pathway. Such tumours display frameshift mutations (*Fig. 2*) and base-pair substitutions that are commonly found in short, tandemly repeated, nucleotide sequences known as microsatellites²³,₃₇⁻⁴⁰ (for example CACACACA or [CA]₄). This form of genetic destabilization is most commonly caused by loss of the DNA mismatch repair function.

### Microsatellites and genomic instability

Microsatellites are found in great number spread out over the whole DNA sequence and, owing to their repetitive nature, are prone to changes during replication. The most common microsatellite in humans is a dinucleotide repeat of cytosine and adenine which occurs in several thousand locations throughout the human germline⁴⁰ (*Fig. 3*). MSI is a situation in which a germline microsatellite allele has gained or lost repeated units and has thus undergone a somatic change in length (*Fig. 3*). This type of alteration can be detected only if many cells are affected by the same change, and is thus an indicator of the clonal expansion typical of a neoplasm.

Mismatches of nucleotides occur when DNA polymerase inserts the wrong bases in newly synthesized DNA. Normally, when two strands of DNA replicate, nucleotide mismatches occur, but almost all such errors are quickly corrected by a molecular proofreading mechanism (*Fig. 3*). The DNA mismatch repair system works as a ‘spell checker’ that identifies and then corrects the mismatched base pairs in the DNA. However, defects in the mismatch repair mechanisms (mutated genes) lead to MSI.

### Microsatellite instability in hereditary and sporadic colorectal cancer

MSI in hereditary and sporadic colorectal cancer occurs through two different mechanisms. In HNPCC the cause is a germline mutation in a mismatch repair enzyme; alterations of the *MutS* homologue 2 (*MSH2*) and *MutL* homologue 1 (*MLH1*) mismatch repair genes account for more than 90 per cent. Instability in microsatellite sequences in sporadic colorectal cancer exhibiting MSI is often due to loss of expression of a mismatch repair gene (most commonly *MLH1*) caused by epigenetic silencing.

### Hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer: germline mutation in mismatch repair genes

MSI was discovered to be a marker in HNPCC a decade ago⁴⁰,⁴¹, when searching for LOH in the susceptible region to find a tumour suppressor gene among dinucleotide repeats. Instead, microsatellites that had changed in length were found in all the HNPCCs – not only in the critical genetic region, but virtually everywhere in the genome of the tumour. This phenomenon was termed replication error and later renamed MSI⁴⁰⁻⁴³. Widespread MSI in HNPCC is associated with defective DNA mismatch repair proteins caused by germline mutation of one of the three main genes (*MLH1*, *MSH2* and

**Fig. 2** Frameshift mutations. In a frameshift mutation, the deletion or insertion of a nucleotide shifts the normal sequence of nucleotides in a triplet codon, which may alter the amino acid sequence and thus the protein expressed. In the example, the addition of a base to the DNA sequence shifts the reading frame, such that most amino acids downstream of the alteration are different from those in the original protein.

MSH6). As a consequence, the lifetime risk of developing colorectal cancer is over 80 per cent in the children of those with HNPCC, compared with a lifetime risk of colorectal cancer of up to 5–6 per cent in the general population^{44,45}. In addition, the risk is greatly increased for endometrial cancer (lifetime risk of 50–60 per cent, compared with 2–3 per cent in the general population), moderately increased for ovarian and gastric cancers (12 and 13 per cent respectively)^{44,46}, but equals that of the normal population for lung, prostate and breast cancers.

Sporadic colorectal cancer: microsatellite instability through epigenetic silencing

Deficient mismatch repair occurs in approximately 15 per cent of all sporadic colorectal cancers. In contrast to HNPCC, the cause in sporadic colorectal cancer is often biallelic or hemiallelic^{47} methylation of cytosine residues of the cytosine and guanine (CpG)-rich promoter sequences of *MLH1*^{47–50}. Simply stated, the epigenetic change affects gene function (without genetic changes) by aberrant methylation of DNA that prevents the gene (or gene-region) from being transcribed, thus ‘silencing’ the gene and causing deficiency in protein expression. Epigenetic silencing is now recognized as a third pathway in Knudson’s model of tumour suppressor gene inactivation in cancer^{51,52}. For selected genes, epigenetic changes are

tightly related to neoplastic transformation in colorectal cancer. As an example, loss of the tumour suppressor gene *phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN)* located at 10q23 occurs through promotor hypermethylation in colorectal cancer with high-frequency MSI (MSI-H)^{53}. In the colon, aberrant DNA methylation arises very early, initially in normal mucosa, and may be part of the age-related field defect observed in sporadic colorectal cancer. Aberrant methylation also contributes to later stages of colorectal cancer formation and progression through a hypermethylator phenotype termed CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP). CIMP appears to be a defining event in about half of all sporadic colorectal cancers^{54} (*Fig. 1*). CIMP-positive colorectal cancers are characterized by distinct pathological, clinical and molecular genetic features^{54–57}.

MSI in sporadic colorectal cancer usually arises because of epigenetic silencing of the DNA mismatch repair gene *MLH1*^{58}, and is thus associated with methylation, but the overlap of ‘mutator’ and ‘methylator’ phenotypes is not exact^{24,37,39}. In particular, some cancers with extensive DNA methylation do not show the mutator phenotype. Although DNA methylation is associated with a worse outcome in colorectal cancer, this adverse prognostic influence is lost in methylated tumours with MSI^{59}. Collectively these factors add a layer of complexity to the molecular classification of colorectal cancer.

Microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer

### Testing for microsatellite instability in colorectal cancer

The choice of microsatellite markers is important for MSI testing<sup>60–64</sup>. Testing for MSI using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is straightforward; DNA from the tumour and from normal tissue is tested. Mutations that alter microsatellite length (by deletion or insertion) are visualized as bandshifts on electrophoresis.

The 1997 Bethesda guidelines<sup>65,66</sup> proposed a panel of five microsatellite markers for the uniform analysis of MSI in HNPCC. This panel included two mononucleotide (BAT-25 and BAT-26) and three dinucleotide (D5S346, D2S123 and D17S250) repeats. The Bethesda guidelines have since been revised<sup>67</sup>, as the use of dinucleotide repeats may cause underestimation and overestimation of the instability status. The revision mainly recommends the use of more mononucleotide markers in equivocal situations (only in dinucleotide-unstable cases). Screening for HNPCC using the recommended Bethesda MSI markers is now performed in trials for detection of HNPCC<sup>64,68</sup>, but current diagnostic yield and costs suggest caution<sup>69</sup>. Although feasible, the option of screening all patients with colorectal cancer for MSI should await further evidence of the clinical value and therapeutic influence of the information gained.

#### Microsatellite frequency

Whatever the number of microsatellite markers used in a panel, instability in 40 per cent of markers or more (two of five markers in the Bethesda panel) is defined as MSI-H, whereas instability in 20–40 per cent of markers is defined as low-frequency MSI (MSI-L). Tumours with no proven instability (20 per cent or less) are termed microsatellite stable (MSS) and these tumours comprise those said to follow the CIN pathway (*Fig. 1*). The existence of MSI-L is still debated<sup>61,70–73</sup>. Complexities (beyond the scope of this review) are related to the wide genomic distribution of dinucleotides, the yet unresolved molecular alterations that have been found in these markers, and the possible influence on carcinogenesis<sup>70,73–75</sup>. When many dinucleotide markers are used, a large number of colorectal cancers are graded as MSI-L<sup>73</sup>. The selective use of mononucleotide markers may avoid this problem<sup>61,63,76</sup>. However, proponents of the existence of MSI-L tumours have found frequent *K-ras* mutations, as well as a higher incidence of LOH at 5q, 1p and 8p<sup>4</sup>, relating them to the CIN pathway<sup>72</sup>, although this has not been confirmed in other studies<sup>73</sup>. Interestingly, the DNA repair gene O-6-methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (*MGMT*) is epigenetically silenced more frequently in MSI-L

tumours than in both MSI-H and MSS cancers<sup>77</sup>, which suggests a different method of DNA error repair. MSI-L status has been related to poor prognosis in patients with stage C cancers<sup>12</sup>. Although techniques for improved detection of these subtle differences are developing, such as hypermethylation of *MGMT*<sup>78</sup>, the true clinicopathological yield of MSI-L status remains to be established.

#### Immunohistochemistry for microsatellite instability

Immunohistochemistry (IHC), although proposed as more cost-effective than PCR, is currently not sensitive and specific enough to be used routinely in detecting MSI in sporadic and hereditary colorectal cancer. Reasons for this include heterogeneity within tumours; weak and focal staining patterns that may be associated with MSI or gene mutation, or both; variability in technical protocols for fixation and staining quality within laboratories; and differences in interpretation of results. The rate of normal IHC results (but with PCR-detected mutations) ranges from 2 to 36 per cent<sup>79–81</sup>, and PCR has a higher sensitivity and specificity than IHC<sup>82</sup>. One of the major problems with IHC is detection of *MLH1* gene mutations, for which the sensitivity is 44 per cent. Consequently, IHC cannot yet replace PCR in HNPCC<sup>82</sup>.

In a population-based study of sporadic colorectal cancer<sup>79</sup>, IHC was evaluated for MSI detection and lacked a positive stain for one or more mismatch repair proteins in 8·3 per cent of patients, mostly attributed to *MSH1*. Retesting of discordant cases with both IHC and PCR revealed that IHC failed to detect 17 of 47 cancers with MSI<sup>79</sup>. Methods of detecting MSI continue to develop, and correlation with genetic defects explored with cDNA microarray analysis will further improve understanding in the future<sup>61–63,79,82–85</sup>.

### Genetic differences between tumours with microsatellite instability and those with chromosomal instability

Tumours exhibiting CIN and those with MSI resemble one another in all but a few distinct ways. Tumours with CIN have mutations in *p53* and *APC*, including gross chromosomal abnormalities. In contrast, tumours with MSI have frameshift mutations in specific target genes, such as β-catenin and transforming growth factor β receptor II (*TGF-βRII*)<sup>86</sup>, and fewer mutations are found in *K-ras* and *p53*<sup>87</sup>. The genetic differences between these two types of colorectal cancer continue to be explored. Considerable ‘cross-talk’ between various pathways is encountered

(Fig. 4), although a few distinct genetic differences seem to appear.

Defective mismatch repair presumably facilitates malignant transformation by allowing the rapid accumulation of mutations that inactivate genes that ordinarily have key functions in the cell (Table 1, Fig. 4). The lack of mismatch repair proteins leads to failure of correction of nucleotide mismatches and thus promotes mutations in other genes. However, genes carrying MSI in their own coding sequences are also involved, such as the Bcl-2-associated X protein (BAX) and TGF-βRII genes<sup>88</sup>. A frameshift mutation inactivates the BAX gene in about 35 per cent of all tumours with MSI. Altered BAX expression is believed to contribute to carcinogenesis by disrupting the apoptosis pathway mediated by B-cell CLL/lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) (Fig. 4)<sup>89–94</sup>. The TGF-βRII gene undergoes a frameshift in up to 90 per cent of all HNPCCs<sup>95</sup>. This mutation leads to a disruption in the function of transforming growth factor (TGF) β, which acts as both a tumour suppressor and promoter in colorectal cancer<sup>96–100</sup>. The TGF-β signalling pathway involves activation of the Smad proteins

which regulate transcription (Fig. 4). Other genes with coding microsatellites (for example the tumour suppressor gene p16<sup>INK4A</sup>) are mutated in mismatch repair-deficient colorectal cancer, but their precise roles are not well understood.

More recently, the use of array technology has allowed identification of a number of genes that are expressed differentially in the two subtypes of colorectal cancer<sup>52,53,83,101</sup>. Genomic and proteomic profiles<sup>102</sup> of subtypes of colorectal cancer may increase the biological understanding of cancer and, hopefully, reveal distinct prognostic and predictive markers to assist the choice and timing of therapy, and improve follow-up regimens<sup>103</sup>.

### Clinicopathological implications of microsatellite instability status

Recently, distinct clinical and pathological features of colorectal tumours arising from these two separate mutational pathways have been identified (Fig. 5)<sup>104–107</sup>. MSI-H is observed more frequently in women and in

colorectal cancers that occur proximal to the splenic flexure. These tumours also exhibit poor differentiation, a mucinous cell type and frequently peritumoral lymphocytic infiltration ('Crohn's like inflammation')<sup>105,108,109</sup>. The mechanisms by which this inflammatory response may contribute to a better prognosis remain to be fully explained, but the cytotoxic effects of CD8-positive lymphocytes seem to be important<sup>108,109</sup>. Recent data suggest an interplay between TGF-β and peritumoral lymphocytes<sup>96</sup>.

Tumours displaying MSI are usually diploid, whereas those exhibiting CIN are often aneuploid. Colorectal cancer exhibiting MSI is associated with larger (T3 tumours) primary tumours, but with a more favourable stage (less lymph node involvement and reduced occurrence of metastasis). The pronounced genetic instability of cells with MSI may increase susceptibility to apoptosis because of an accumulation of mutations in genes that are required for cell growth. An increased rate of mutation in other genes might lead to aberrantly expressed proteins in membranes, which may be associated with the antitumour immune response typified by lymphocytic infiltrates that surround tumours with MSI<sup>105,108,109</sup>.

Cancers demonstrating MSI have a higher incidence of synchronous and metachronous tumours. In a recent study, Velayos *et al.*<sup>110</sup> found that MSI occurred with equal frequency among patients with synchronous and metachronous colorectal cancers. However, the underlying mechanism for MSI was different (loss of *MLH1* expression associated with promoter hypermethylation was more common in MSI-H synchronous colorectal cancer). Observed differences in *MLH1* promoter hypermethylation and patient characteristics suggested that most MSI-H synchronous colorectal cancers were sporadic in origin<sup>110</sup>.

Most importantly, patients with colorectal cancers that exhibit MSI have longer overall and cancer-specific survival than stage-matched patients with cancers exhibiting CIN<sup>8,10</sup>. The important contrast in survival between the two types of colorectal cancer remains unexplained. Paradoxically, colorectal cancers with MSI bear many features that are generally associated with poor prognosis, including deep tumour invasion and poor histological differentiation. However, hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer rarely exhibit MSI<sup>111</sup>.

Mutations of the *p53* gene are less common in tumours that exhibit MSI than in those that develop via the CIN pathway<sup>87</sup>. The same holds true for allelic imbalance at other genetic loci, such as 18q. Mutations of *p53* are associated with poor prognosis<sup>13</sup>, explaining in part the prognostic advantage of tumours with MSI. However, MSI-positive tumours that express *p53* seem to have a more aggressive biology than their *p53*-negative counterparts<sup>104</sup>.

Adjuvant chemotherapy with fluorouracil benefits patients with tumours exhibiting CIN, but apparently not those with tumours exhibiting MSI<sup>11</sup>. However, an

overall reduced benefit from adjuvant therapy in patients  
with MSI and colorectal cancer could not be demonstrated  
in a recent systematic review and meta-analysis¹⁰, but  
overall survival with MSI-positive colorectal tumours was  
better. Thus, the mechanism by which MSI renders  
cancers less aggressive clinically remains interesting but  
unresolved. Real differences in adjuvant chemotherapy  
response between tumours exhibiting MSI and CIN remain  
to be demonstrated.

### Conclusions

The biological and clinical implications of MSI in  
colorectal cancer continue to develop. It is now established  
that colorectal cancer with MSI follows a pathway different  
from that characterized by CIN. The clinicopathological  
characteristics are becoming clear, but specific genetic,  
prognostic and therapeutic differences remain to be  
fully defined. Investigation of MSI status in colorectal  
cancer is warranted for three reasons: first, as a potential  
screening tool for HNPCC, second as a prognostic  
marker and, finally, as a potential predictor of response  
to chemotherapy. To improve understanding of colorectal  
cancer further, subgroup stratification according to MSI  
status appears important; this is now appreciated in cancer  
research in general¹⁰². Answers to basic research questions,  
prediction of disease progress and prognosis, development  
of new therapies and tailoring of adjuvant therapy should  
result.
