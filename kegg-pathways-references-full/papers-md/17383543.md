## Abstract

Rap1 (Ras-proximity 1), a member of the Ras family of small guanine triphosphatases (GTPases), is activated by diverse extracellular stimuli. While Rap1 has been discovered originally as a potential Ras antagonist, accumulating evidence indicates that Rap1 per se mediates unique signals and exerts biological functions distinctly different from Ras. Rap1 plays a dominant role in the control of cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions by regulating the function of integrins and other adhesion molecules in various cell types. Rap1 also regulates MAP kinase (MAPK) activity in a manner highly dependent on the context of cell types. Recent studies (including gene-targeting analysis) have uncovered that the Rap1 signal is integrated crucially and unpredictably in the diverse aspects of comprehensive biological systems. This review summarizes the role of the Rap1 signal in developments and functions of the immune and hematopoietic systems as well as in malignancy. Importantly, Rap1 activation is tightly regulated in tissue cells, and dysregulations of the Rap1 signal in specific tissues result in certain disorders, including myeloproliferative disorders and leukemia, platelet dysfunction with defective hemostasis, leukocyte adhesion-deficiency syndrome, lupus-like systemic autoimmune disease, and T cell anergy. Many of these disorders resemble human diseases, and the Rap1 signal with its regulators may provide rational molecular targets for controlling certain human diseases including malignancy.

## 1. Introduction

Rap1 (Ras-proximity 1), a member of the Ras family of small guanine triphosphatases (GTPases), displays high overall homology (~50%) to the classical K-, H-, and N-Ras with an identical effector domain (Pizon et al., 1988). Rap1

is conserved in eukaryocytes from yeasts through mammals. In budding yeasts, Rap1 (Rsr1) is essential for the proper determination of budding sites for mating (*Bender and Pringle*, 1989). Rap1 in *Drosophila melanogaster* (DRap1) is also an essential gene that plays crucial roles in various aspects of morphogenesis (*Asha et al.*, 1999). The prototype, or the so-called “roughened eyes,” is caused by a gain-of-function mutation of the Rap1 gene (*Hariharan et al.*, 1991). In mammals, there are two Rap1 isoforms coded by distinct genes (Rap1A and Rap1B) with limited differences in constitutional amino acids and redundant activities (*Bos et al.*, 2001). It was first reported that overexpression of Rap1 (originally called K-rev) could revert the characteristic “malignant” contours of the fibroblasts transformed by oncogenic K-Ras to a flat shape similar to normal fibroblasts (*Kitayama et al.*, 1989). This raised the initial idea that Rap1 might act as a functional antagonist of oncogenic Ras. The exact roles of Rap1 in mammalian cells, however, have remained rather enigmatic for nearly a decade. In the late 1990s, two distinct biological activities mediated by the Rap1 signal (independent of Ras) emerged, viz., the activation of MAP kinases (MAPKs) and control of cell adhesion via integrins. Since then, numerous findings on the roles of Rap1 in many cell types of various tissues have accumulated, and it has become evident that the Rap1 signal mediates highly diverse cellular activities depending on the cellular contexts. In the present chapter, we first summarize recent advances on the general biology of Rap1, including regulation and function of the Rap1 signal, before proceeding to discuss how a ubiquitous molecular switch (Rap1) is integrated into the signaling pathways to control highly sophisticated and specified cellular functions, with particular emphasis on the immune/hematopoietic systems and malignancy.

## 2. General Biology of the Rap1 Signal

One of the most intriguing features of Rap1 is that it is activated by an extensive variety of external stimuli delivered to the cell, including numerous growth factors, peptide hormones, neurotransmitters, cytokines, chemokines, antigens, cell-adhesion molecules, and physical stimuli such as cell stretch/contraction.

### 2.1. Regulation of Rap1 Activation

Similar to many other small G-proteins, Rap1 binds with guanine nucleotides to form Rap1GTP (an active form) or Rap1GDP (an inactive form) that interacts or dissociates with a number of downstream effector molecules, respectively. Due to its intrinsic GTPase activity, GTP bound to Rap1 is autonomously hydrolyzed to GDP. Therefore, activation of Rap1 requires specific enzymes
that dissociate GDP from Rap1 to facilitate repetitive GTP loading, that is, the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). A number of distinct Rap1 GEFs sharing a catalytic GEF domain have been identified, and they are coupled with various receptors or intracellular second messengers (Fig. 1; Bos *et al.*, 2001; Hattori and Minato, 2003). C3G, which is a Rap1GEF ubiquitously expressed in most cell types, binds to the SH3 domain of Crk adaptor proteins, and is recruited to the plasma membrane and phosphorylated on activation of receptor-associated protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs; Gotoh *et al.*, 1995; Ichiba *et al.*, 1999). Phosphorylated C3G is a major Rap1 activator in the plasma membrane. CalDAG-GEF harbor the Ca²⁺ ion- and diacylglycerol (DAG)-binding sites. Activation of CalDAG-GEF I is regulated by the Ca²⁺ ion, while CalDAG-GEF III is translocated to the membrane by binding DAG, and thus these GEFs may mediate Rap1 activation downstream of PLC activation (Kawasaki *et al.*, 1998). On the other hand, the Epac family of Rap1GEFs has specific cyclic AMP (cAMP)-binding domains at the N-terminal region. Binding cAMP induces conformational changes in Epacs to release the inhibitory constraint covering the catalytic GEF domain, thus allowing interaction with the substrate

Figure 1 Regulation and functions of the Rap1 signal. Refer to the text for the details.Rap1 (Bos, 2003; de Rooij *et al.*, 1998). It has been demonstrated that certain cAMP-induced biological activities, such as cell adhesion and insulin secretion, are mediated by the Epac/Rap1 rather than by cAMP-dependent protein kinase pathway (Bos, 2003). Epacs may play a major role in the cytosolic Rap1 activation downstream of trimeric G-protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs). Thus, distinct types of Rap1 GEFs are tightly coupled with the major signaling pathways to induce Rap1 activation at the different intracellular compartments via diverse extracellular stimuli (Fig. 1).

Rap1 does not share a conserved catalytic residue with other small G-proteins, such as Ras, Rho, or Cdc42, and displays much lower intrinsic GTPase activity. The swift inactivation of Rap1GTP to terminate the signal, therefore, is crucially dependent on Rap1 GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). Rap1GAPs specifically bind to GTP-bound Rap1 to provide a catalytic residue (asparagine) for Rap1 thereby enhancing the GTPase activity by multiple orders (Daumke *et al.*, 2004). In contrast to the diverse types of Rap1GEFs, there are only two groups of Rap1GAPs (i.e., RapGAs and SPA-1 family) that share a catalytic domain called the GAP-related domain (GRD). While RapGA1 is expressed rather ubiquitously (most prominently expressed in the brain), RapGA2 is distributed exclusively in platelets (Kurachi *et al.*, 1997; Schultess *et al.*, 2005). An isoform of RapGA1 binds to Gα via the N-terminal region and may be translocated to the plasma membrane following the activation of GPCRs, thus attenuating Rap1 activation at the membrane (Mochizuki *et al.*, 1999). The SPA-1 family of Rap1GAPs consists of SPA-1, SPA-1-like (SPA-L) 1 (also called E6TP1 or SPAR), SPA-L 2, and SPA-L 3, all of which share a PDZ domain in addition to a GRD. SPA-1 is most abundantly expressed in lymphohematopoietic tissues and certain cancer cells, while SPAR is distributed in epithelial tissues and the brain (Gao *et al.*, 1999; Hattori *et al.*, 1995; Pak *et al.*, 2001). They are located in various intracellular compartments, such as the synaptic vesicles, actin cytoskeleton, plasma membranes, and possibly nuclei, depending on the cell type and specific protein interaction via the PDZ domain (Farina *et al.*, 2004; Roy *et al.*, 2002; Tsukamoto *et al.*, 1999). All the Rap1GAPs are constitutively active without any protein modification. As such, the expression levels of Rap1GAPs per se may determine the threshold and degree of Rap1 activation at any given compartment (see below). Notably, E6TP1 is specifically degraded by human papillomavirus E6 oncoprotein via E6AP ubiquitin ligase similarly to p53 in a fashion closely correlated with E6-mediated epithelial cell transformation (Gao *et al.*, 2001, 2002). Rap1GAPs have no structural similarities to GAPs for other small G-proteins, such as Ras, Rho, Arf, or Rab, and a study has indicated that the mode of GAP activity for Rap1 is also different from that of GAPs for other G-proteins (Daumke *et al.*, 2004).

2.2. Biological Function of Rap1

2.2.1. Regulation of MAPK Activation

Although it has been a matter of argument for almost a decade whether the Rap1 signal activates extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK), accumulating evidence has indicated that the Rap1 signal does activate the MAPK kinase-1 (MEK-1), 2–ERK pathway selectively via B-Raf (*Vossler et al.*, 1997), which is expressed in only selected tissue cells (*Barnier et al.*, 1995). This finding probably explains why Rap1-mediated ERK activation has been observed only in certain selected cell types. While ubiquitous c-Raf-1 needs to be phosphorylated to activate MEK-1, 2, B-Raf is constitutively phosphorylated at the corresponding sites (*Mason et al.*, 1999) and activates MEK-1, 2 by being recruited to the plasma membrane by Rap1GTP. This was confirmed genetically in *Drosophila melanogaster*, which has only one Raf isoform (DRaf) corresponding to the mammalian B-Raf. Thus, DRap1 that has been activated downstream of torso receptor tyrosine kinase binds to DRaf and induces ERK activation, which in turn incites activation of *tailless* and *huckebein* genes controlling the terminal structures in embryos (*Mishra et al.*, 2005). Although Rap1GTP binds to c-Raf-1 with an affinity even higher than RasGTP in mammalian cells, it may not lead to the activation of MEK-1, 2–ERK pathway, partly because Rap1GTP is incapable of inducing c-Raf-1 phosphorylation required for the activation of the kinase activity (*Mishra et al.*, 2005).

ERK activation by Rap1, however, shows a unique feature distinctly different from Ras-mediated ERK activation. In PC12 neuronal cell line that strongly expresses B-Raf, the epithelial growth factor (EGF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) specifically induce the proliferation and differentiation, respectively (*Marshall*, 1995; *Qui and Green*, 1992; *Traverse et al.*, 1992). NGF rapidly elicits peak followed by sustained activation of ERK, while EGF induces only a transient ERK activation, suggesting that a persistent ERK activation is required for PC12 cell differentiations. Although Ras mediates the rapid and transient ERK activation elicited by both factors, Rap1 is responsible for the NGF-induced sustained activation of ERK (*Kao et al.*, 2001; *York et al.*, 1998). Sophisticated analyses have suggested that different ERK activation kinetics might reflect the different regulatory mechanisms of Ras and Rap1 activations (*Sasagawa et al.*, 2005). While Ras is activated rapidly by SOS recruited to the plasma membrane via Grb2 following stimulation before recruitment of phosphorylated RasGAP, activated ERK induces phosphorylation of SOS and the dissociation from Grb2. Because of the recruitment of RasGAP and the tight negative feedback by ERK, the activation dynamics of Ras may primarily depend on the temporal rate, rather than the magnitude, of stimuli. On the other hand, a negative feedback mechanism for Rap1 activation has not been

defined to date, and there is little evidence advocating that Rap1GAPs are specifically recruited following stimulation. Thus, Rap1 activation may continue as long as the stimuli persist potently enough to overcome the basal Rap1GAP activity, and the activation dynamics of Rap1 may directly reflect the duration and degree of stimuli. Ligand-occupied EGF receptors (EGFRs) are internalized and rapidly degraded thereafter to likely induce only transient Ras activation with limited Rap1 activation, that is, the transient ERK activation. In contrast, NGF receptors (TrkAs) occupied with ligands are trapped and prevail in the endosomal membrane to induce sustained ERK activation via Rap1 activation. Thus, Rap1 and Ras may mediate and yield different biological effects due to their distinctly different kinetics in ERK activation.

Another aspect of the Rap1 signal in ERK activation is its possible effect on Ras-mediated ERK activation. As mentioned earlier, Rap1GTP may not contribute to ERK activation via ubiquitous c-Raf-1 but may rather competitively interfere with Ras-mediated ERK activation at the level of c-Raf-1 when overexpressed ([Boussiotis *et al.*, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.onc.1201465)). While ambiguity of such an effect occurring under normal physiological conditions remains unresolved, recent reports have indicated its involvement under certain *in vivo* conditions (see below). In short, the Rap1 signal, depending on the cell contexts, may regulate ERK activation in different ways.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that the Rap1 signal also activates the MEK-3, 6–p38MAPK pathway. Rap1 is reportedly activated by cell-stretch force to induce MEK-3, 6-mediated p38MAPK activation, while Ras-signaling is inactivated ([Sawada *et al.*, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.041628698); [Tamada *et al.*, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M313081200)). On the contrary, cell contraction force activates the Ras-mediated MEK-1, 2–ERK pathways with little Rap1 activation ([Sawada *et al.*, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.041628698)). Similar complementary activations of Rap1-p38MAPK and Ras–ERK pathways have also been reported in other systems. In hippocampal neurons, for instance, Rap-1-mediated p38MAPK activation induces nonmetabolic glutamate receptor-mediated removal of synaptic AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid) receptors during long-term depression ([Zhu *et al.*, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(02)00672-5)). On the other hand, delivery of AMPA receptors to the synaptic sites during long-term potentiation is dependent on the Ras-mediated ERK activation. Under such circumstances, it appears that the Rap1–MKK3, 6–p38MAPK and Ras–MKK1, 2–ERK pathways form parallel but opposing signaling modules.

Since Rap1 shares the effector domain with Ras, Rap1GTP is expected to bind other Ras effectors such as RalGDS and PI3Kp110 subunit ([Bos *et al.*, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1038/35085000)). The PI3K–AKT pathway is activated by receptor PTKs in a Ras-dependent or Ras-independent manner ([Shaw and Cantley, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1038/nrm1991)). For instance, the regulatory effect of cAMP on cell proliferation is in part mediated by the control of Rap1-mediated activation of the PI3K–AKT pathway
(Tsygankova *et al.*, 2001; Wang *et al.*, 2001). It has been shown that the proliferation and survival of hematopoietic cells induced by IL-3 or B-cell receptors (BCR)-ABL oncoprotein are influenced by Rap1-mediated activation of the PI3K–AKT pathway (Jin *et al.*, 2006).

### 2.2.2. Control of Cell Adhesion

SPA-1 overexpression (abrogating the endogenous Rap1 activation) induced rounding and eventual detachment of inherently adherent cells from extracellular matrix, while overexpression of membrane-targeted C3G (C3G-F) enhanced cell-spreading on extracellular matrix (Tsukamoto *et al.*, 1999). This was one of the first indications to show involvement of the Rap1 signal in regulating cell adhesion. Since then, many reports have confirmed that the Rap1 signal regulates the integrin-mediated cell adhesion induced by various stimuli in many cell types; viz., β1 (VLA-4) and β2 (LFA-1) integrin activations of lymphocytes by CD31 (Reedquist *et al.*, 2000) and CD98 (Suga *et al.*, 2001) stimulation; β2 (Mac-1) integrin activation of macrophage for phagocytosis by LPS (Schmidt *et al.*, 2001); LFA-1 activation of lymphocytes by chemokine stimulation (Shimonaka *et al.*, 2003); and αIIb β3 integrin activation of platelets by thrombin or ADP (Crittenden *et al.*, 2004). Normal resting T cells initially express a low affinity or an “inactive” form of LFA-1 before conversion to the high affinity or “active” form by stimulation with antigens via a process called “inside-out” activation (Carman and Springer, 2003). Expressing an active form of Rap1 in T cells rapidly increases the affinity of LFA-1, while overexpression of SPA-1 or a dominant-negative Rap1 mutant completely inhibits LFA-1 activation by antigen-receptor stimulation (Katagiri *et al.*, 2000). These findings clearly indicate that Rap1 is a major mediator of “inside-out” activation of integrins in T cells (see below). These results have clarified that Rap1 serves as a major integrin-activating signal, unveiling a novel and important functional aspect of Rap1.

The overall cell adhesiveness induced by integrins is controlled by distinct elements such as the “affinity” of each monomeric integrin molecule, “valency” defined by the diffusivity or local density of integrins and ligands, and “adhesion strengthening” induced following integrin interaction with ligands (Carman and Springer, 2003). Crystal structure analyses have revealed that affinity regulation of integrins is based on their conformational changes (Xiong *et al.*, 2001). Thus, the extracellular stork of α and β chains in a low-affinity state is sharply bent so that the ligand-binding head is juxtaposed to the membrane portion of the stork (closed posture), while the binding site is free from constraints and unfurls openly (open posture) in a high-affinity state. The conformational change is regulated by proteins (such as talin), which bind to the cytoplasmic domain of integrins (Carman and Springer, 2003). In lymphoid cells, RapL (a specific effector of Rap1) associates directly with the cytoplasmic tail of LFA-1$\alpha$-chain on binding to Rap1GTP to likely induce an open posture of LFA-1 (Katagiri *et al.*, 2003). In addition, a study has indicated that activation of integrins by the Rap1 signal also induces redistribution and polarity of integrin expression (Shimonaka *et al.*, 2003). Thus, the Rap1 signal may affect the overall integrin-mediated cell adhesion through multiple mechanisms.

In this aspect, Rap1GTP has been found to bind also with a new adaptor called the Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule (RIAM), which displays high homology to lamellipodin (Lpd; Lafuente *et al.*, 2004). Knockdown of RIAM displaces Rap1GTP from the plasma membrane and reverts integrin-mediated cell adhesion induced by Rap1, while RIAM overexpression enhances integrin-dependent cell adhesion and facilitates cell spreading. Interestingly, RIAM interacts directly with profilin and Ena/VASP family proteins to maintain the cellular content of F-actin (Lafuente *et al.*, 2004). Profilin and Ena/VASP are important regulators of the actin cytoskeleton, and thus Rap1 not only induces integrin activation but also may directly regulate actin dynamics required for cell spreading and migration, viz., lamellipodia formation (Bailly, 2004). These results may place Rap1 in a crucial position linking cell-signaling and actin-cytoskeleton changes.

Cumulative evidence has further advocated that Rap1 plays an important role in the maintenance of integrity of intercellular adhesion in epithelial and endothelial cells. Convincing data on the role of the Rap1 signal in controlling adherence junctions have been derived again from a genetic study of *Drosophila* (Knox and Brown, 2002). During development of the wing, where mediation by even cell adhesion among adjacent cells via the circumferentially distributed DE-cadherin is involved, expanding epithelial cells of the related lineages normally stay in a coherent group. The epithelial cells with mutant Rap1, however, lose the circumferential expression of DE-cadherin and selectively form an adherence junction to the adjacent cells ipsilaterally, resulting in disrupted epithelial cell behavior (Knox and Brown, 2002). This may, in part, explain the abnormal morphogenesis in Rap1-mutant *Drosophila* (Hariharan *et al.*, 1991). The roles of Rap1 in the formation and maintenance of E-cadherin-mediated adherence junctions in epithelial cells and VE-cadherin-mediated endothelial barrier function have been reported also in mammalian cells. For instance, the Rap1 signal plays an important role in protecting the endothelial cell barrier function against factors (e.g., thrombin and so on) that cause barrier dysfunctions (Cullere *et al.*, 2005; Fukuhara *et al.*, 2005). In epithelial cells, Rap1 regulates the endocytosis of E-cadherin and controls the accumulation and distribution of E-cadherin on cell surfaces by specific binding to a scaffold protein afadin (or AF-6) (Hoshino *et al.*, 2005). Interestingly, AF-6 also binds SPA-1 and regulates Rap1-GAP activity at the adherence junction (Su *et al.*, 2003). A component of tight junction (TJ), JAM1, has been found to constitutively deliver the Rap1 signal on intercellular epithelial cell adhesion, and disruption of the Rap1 signaling results in marked
changes in epithelial cell morphology and impairment of β1-integrin-mediated adhesion to extracellular matrix (Mandell *et al.*, 2005). These results imply that the Rap1 signal plays an important role in the functional cross talk between intercellular adhesion (adherence junction) and the adhesion to extracellular matrix in epithelial cells.

# 3. Rap1 Signal in Lymphocyte Development and Immune Responses

Small G-proteins of the Ras, Rho, and Rac families play crucial roles in various aspects of lymphocyte development and function (Cantrell, 2003). Recent studies, including those using gene-engineered mice, have begun to unveil unique roles of the Rap1 signal in lymphocyte development and immune responses ([Table 1](https://www.example.com)).

## 3.1. Thymic T Cell Development: Distinct Roles of Rap1 and Ras

Using transgenic mice expressing the RapV12 mutant gene under a human CD2 promoter, it was shown that excessive Rap1 signals barely affected overall thymic T cell development (Sebzda *et al.*, 2002). However, we have recently found that mice conditionally expressing the RapE63 (another dominant active mutant of Rap1) transgene, driven by a more potent CAG promoter, exhibit significant decreases in double-positive (DP) thymocytes (Kometani *et al.*, manuscript in preparation). The discrepancy may reflect the fact that V12 mutation of Rap1 may not be an ideal dominant active form unlike in other small G-proteins such as Ras, Rho, and Rac (Daumke *et al.*, 2004). The expansion and subsequent positive selection of DP thymocytes is reportedly dependent on the Ras signal (Swan *et al.*, 1995). Thus, it appears that Rap1 activation surpassing a certain level interferes with Ras-dependent expansion or positive selection of DP thymocytes, although the physiological significance remains to be verified.

A more important question of whether the endogenous Rap1 signal is required for the normal thymic T cell development warrants attention. To shed light on this ambiguity, we innovated an experimental model—the SPA-1 transgenic mice—for further investigation. Since the mice expressing SPA-1 transgene driven by a ubiquitous CAG promoter were embryonically lethal, we generated LoxP-franked SPA-1 transgenic mice and then crossed them with lck-Cre transgenic mice. The conditional transgenic mice revealed severe thymic hypoplasia in which thymic T cell development was arrested at the late double-negative (DN) stage (Kometani *et al.*, manuscript in preparation). Consistently, in fetal thymic organ cultures (FTOC), generation of DP thymocytes from the pro-T cells of Rag2<sup>−/−</sup> mice in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody was suppressed by the

retroviral transduction with SPA-1 or RapA17 (a potent dominant-negative mutant of Rap1; Dupuy *et al.*, 2005). These results strongly suggested that the Rap1 signal was essential for transition from pre-T cells to αβTCR-expressing DP-T cells, that is, the β-selection. While the Ras signal does not reportedly play a major role in β-selection (Swan *et al.*, 1995), a report has indicated that ERK activation is crucially involved in the process (Crompton *et al.*, 1996; Fischer *et al.*, 2005). Therefore, Rap1 may serve as a major signal that mediates ERK activation required for the thymic pre-T cell proliferation and differentiation (Fig. 2).

Figure 2 Involvement of the Rap1 signal in development and activation of T cells. The Rap1 signal is crucial for pre-TCR-mediated β-selection, and conditional expression of SPA-1 transgene in T cell lineage results in the arrest of thymic T cell development at the DN3 stage. On the contrary, excess Rap1 activation in RapE63 transgenic (Tg) mice results in compromised expansion of double-positive (DP) thymocytes and this is most likely due to interference with Ras signaling, which is essential for proliferation and positive selection of DP thymocytes via αβTCR. In peripheral T cells, Rap1 plays an important role in the initiation of immunological synapse formation with antigen-loaded antigen-presenting cells (APC) via TCR-mediated inside-out activation of LFA-1. Such activated Rap1, however, has to be downregulated because persistent Rap1 activation may cause T cell anergy. In SPA-1 knockout (KO) mice, a proportion of CD44<sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells becomes progressively nonresponsive or anergic to TCR-stimulation.

Pre-T-cell receptors (TCR)-mediated β-selection is distinctly different from αβTCR-mediated positive selection in a few aspects: (1) the pre-TCR-mediated signal is triggered by self-polymerization of receptors without specific ligands (*Irving et al.*, 1998; *Yamasaki et al.*, 2006) and (2) the signal threshold in β-selection is extremely low as compared with positive selection. The “hyperexcitability” is ascribed to the intrinsic feature of thymocytes at the DN stage rather than to
that of the pre-TCR (*Erman et al.*, 2004; *Haks et al.*, 2003). It may be possible that the higher excitability of pre-T cells than DP-T cells partly reflects the feature of Rap1-mediated (as opposed to Ras-mediated) ERK activation in the former (Section 1.2.1). Expression profiles of c-Raf-1 and B-Raf at different developmental stages may warrant further investigation. All in all, Rap1 plays significant roles in the thymic αβTcell development. In contrast, development of γδT-lineage cells was completely normal in the SPA-1/lck-Cre transgenic mice, suggesting that the Rap1 signal displays a nonessential role in thymic γδT cell development if any.

### 3.2. Immunological Synapse and T Cell Activation

Interaction of T cells with antigen-presenting cells (APCs) loaded by specific antigens results in the formation of three-dimensional molecular clusters at the contact site, that is, supramolecular activation clusters (SMAC). In SMAC, while TCR and costimulatory molecules are clustered in the central region (cSMAC), LFA-1 is located at the periphery (pSAMC), and CD45 is excluded from the clusters (dSMAC; *Huppa and Davis*, 2003). Being maintained by continuous TCR signaling, this synaptic structure is quite stable and may last more than 10 h (*Huppa and Davis*, 2003). Although the exact function of such a stable synaptic structure remains controversial, it may serve as a platform for molding architectural complexities to: (1) attain the cumulative TCR-signaling effect for full development of the T cell effector function and (2) accommodate regulatory mechanisms for guiding T cell activities. A hallmark of synapse formation is the ring-cluster formation of LFA-1 with ICAM-1 on the APC around TCR clusters, a process initiated by the initial contact of TCR with the specific peptide-loaded MHC (*Huppa and Davis*, 2003).

It has been indicated that the Rap1 signal delivered by TCR ligation plays a crucial role in clustering, reorganization, and activation of LFA-1 for synapse formation. Thus, overexpression of SPA-1 or RapN17 (another dominant-negative mutant of Rap1) in a T cell clone strongly suppresses TCR-mediated LFA-1 activation and synaptic conjugation with specific antigen-loaded APCs, whereas that of Rap1 enhances the conjugate formation (*Katagiri et al.*, 2002). These effects were not observed in the absence of relevant antigens, indicating that TCR-mediated activation of endogenous Rap1 was crucial for clustering and activation of LFA-1 at the contact sites (*Dustin et al.*, 2004; Fig. 2). A report has demonstrated that Rap1GTP is almost exclusively detected at the plasma membrane of T cells in a manner dependent on endosomal recycling, while Rap1GDP is mostly associated with the cytoplasmic vesicular membrane (*Bivona et al.*, 2004). Interestingly, in contrast to most of the TCR-proximal signaling molecules, SLP-76 rapidly dissociates from the TCR-complex and moves to the cytoplasm on APC interaction (*Dustin et al.*, 2004). Thus, an
intriguing model may be proposed such that SLP-76 associates with recycling endosomes containing Rap1GDP, LFA-1, and RapL to subsequently expose them to the plasma membrane, where Rap1 is rapidly activated to Rap1GTP by membrane-recruited GEFs (e.g., C3G, CalDAG-GEF I, and so on). Rap1GTP then causes conformational activation of LFA-1 by inducing RapL binding to the cytoplasmic portion of α chain of LFA-1 (Section 1.1), thus leading to tight interaction with APCs via ICAM-1 binding.

## 3.3. T Cell Nonresponsiveness and Anergy

Full activation of T cells requires additional engagement of costimulatory receptors such as CD28 with CD80/CD86 ligands on the professional APC ([Sharpe and Freeman, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1038/nri751)). Although Ras is strongly activated by the concomitant stimulation of TCR/CD3 and CD28 receptors to induce ERK activation, it is poorly activated by TCR/CD3-stimulation alone ([Carey et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.149.4.801)). In contrast to Ras, Rap1 is potently activated by TCR/CD3-stimulation alone, while concomitant costimulation with anti-CD28 markedly reduces Rap1 activation ([Carey et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.149.4.801); [Reedquist and Bos, 1998](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.143.5.1299)). The results imply that Rap1 activation may have to be downregulated after the initiation of synapse formation for optimal T cell activation. In fact, persistent activation of Rap1 in T cells results in marked decreases of IL-2 production on interaction with antigen-loaded APCs, albeit enhanced conjugate formation may occur ([Katagiri et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20020048)). The reduced IL-2 response is associated with compromised ERK activation, and this is consistent with the concept that persistent Rap1 activation interferes with Ras-mediated ERK activation downstream of TCR ([Boussiotis et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1083/jcb.137.6.1401); [Ishida et al., 2003b](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20021879)). It has further been confirmed that T cells harboring RapE63 transgene show significantly reduced cell proliferation and IL-2 production via TCR-stimulation *in vitro*, and the transgenic mice exhibit compromised antibody responses to TD antigens, but not to TI antigens, *in vivo* ([Li et al., 2005b](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20041988)). We have observed that SPA-1 in T cells is specifically recruited to synaptic sites with antigen-loaded APCs ([Harazaki et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20031950)), and thus SPA-1 most likely plays a role in restraining Rap1 activation after establishing efficient conjugations with APCs to yield optimal T cell activation.

CTLA-4 has a higher affinity for CD80/86 than CD28 and exerts a negative signal for T cell activation, hence playing an important role in terminating T cell responses ([Greenwald et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20041950)). Although CTLA-4 expression is enhanced at the late stages following T cell activation, significant CTLA-4 expression is observed in naive T cells ([Schneider et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20041950)). A study has reported that CTLA-4 stimulation on naive T cells results in strong Rap1 activation to induce potent activation of LFA-1-mediated cell adhesion ([Schneider et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20041950)). Thus, CTLA-4 may also contribute to synapse formation of T cells with APCs.

In contrast to CD28, however, concomitant stimulations of T cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CTLA-4 antibodies potently inhibit T cell activation by recruiting protein tyrosine phosphatases via ITIM motif in the cytoplasmic domain (Greenwald *et al.*, 2001). A study has demonstrated that the T cells from RapGAP transgenic mice, which show compromised Rap1 activation, display significant ERK activation by CD3/CD28/CTLA-4 coligation, while ERK activation is strongly suppressed in control T cells by the same stimuli (Dillon *et al.*, 2005). Accordingly, T cells from the transgenic mice showed significantly lower inhibition of IL-2 production than control T cells by CTLA-4 coligation, although both exhibited comparable inhibition of PLC-γ1 phosphorylation (Dillon *et al.*, 2005). The results clearly suggest that part of the negative effects on T cell activation by CTLA-4 ligation, especially on ERK activation and IL-2 production, is mediated by Rap1 activation.

T cell anergy is a unique state, where T cells are incapable of producing IL-2 and expanding clonally in response to antigens and is thus considered to play a role in peripheral T cell tolerance to self-antigens (Schwartz, 1997). T cell anergy has originally been described as an *in vitro* phenomenon, where TCR occupancy in the absence of costimulatory signals renders the cell nonresponsive, even to properly presented antigens with costimulatory signals. The anergic state can be reversed at least partially by the addition of exogenous IL-2, thus indicating that a major defect is in the TCR-mediated IL-2 production (Schwartz, 1997). Intensive analyses of anergic T cells have revealed two dominant biochemical features distinctly different from those of normal T cells. First, TCR-mediated activation of the Ras–ERK pathway is severely impaired in anergic T cells, resulting in defective generation of the AP-1 complex, while other pathways (e.g., PLC-γ1 activation and so on) remain largely intact. It is controversial whether Ras activation bypassing the TCR signal (e.g., PMA) would restore ERK activation (Schwartz, 1997). Second, there is evidence that IL-2 gene transcription is strongly repressed by *cis*-acting elements in anergic T cells, although the exact nature of repression remains to be elucidated.

Boussiotis *et al.* (1997) have first reported that *in vitro* anergized T cells reveal constitutive activation of Rap1, which in fact is responsible for the defective Ras activation and IL-2 gene activation on CD3 and CD28 stimulations. They have further suggested that constitutive phosphorylation of Cbl by Fyn and its association with CrkL-C3G may be involved in Rap1 activation of anergic T cells (Boussiotis *et al.*, 1997). However, it has been documented that Cbl, which possesses an E3 ubiquitin ligase activity (Joazeiro *et al.*, 1999), elicits ubiquitin modification of CrkL and negatively regulates C3G recruitment and Rap1 activation (Shao *et al.*, 2003). Thus, the involvement of Cbl in constitutive Rap1 activation in anergic T cells remains to be verified. Nonetheless, constitutive
Rap1 activation has also been observed in T cell populations *in vivo* with anergic features such as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup>CD103<sup>+</sup> regulatory T cells ([Li et al., 2005a,b](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). Although normal T cells barely express B-Raf, T cells ectopically expressing B-Raf apparently escape anergy induction *in vitro* by APC stimulation of low B7 expression in association with potent Rap1 and ERK activation ([Dillon et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). In addition, CTLA-4-deficient T cells have been shown to resist anergy induction *in vivo* as well ([Greenwald et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). Collectively, the sustained Rap1 signal downstream of TCR stimulation plays a role in inducing and maintaining an anergic state in T cells, which do not express B-Raf. Downstream effects of Rap1 in maintaining the anergic state warrant further investigations.

We have previously reported that the T cells with CD44<sup>high</sup> memory phenotype in aged SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice selectively exhibit constitutive accumulation of Rap1GTP *in vivo* and manifest markedly compromised proliferation and IL-2 production via TCR stimulation ([Ishida et al., 2003b; Fig. 2](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). We have recently found that the anergic CD44<sup>high</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are in fact accumulated in normal mice as well with aging, albeit the extent is less than that observed in SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (our unpublished observation). The hyporesponsiveness of CD44<sup>high</sup> SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> T cells is probably attributed to impaired ERK activation by TCR-stimulation despite the induction of normal Ras activation ([Ishida et al., 2003b](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). The results reinforce that downregulation of the Rap1 signal by SPA-1 following antigen stimulation may be critical in preventing an anergic state from occurring in primed T cells. By bypassing TCR stimulation with PMA and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore, such anergic T cells still show compromised proliferation and IL-2 production, and thus, Rap1-mediated interference with the Ras–ERK pathway alone may not be able to fully account for the anergic state. A report has suggested that the specifically expressed Tob (an antiproliferative protein family member gene) in anergic T cells may be responsible for IL-2 gene repression by acting as a cofactor of Smad2/4 ([Tzachanis et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). Therefore, the involvement of persistent Rap1 activation in the constitutive repression of IL-2 gene warrants further studies.

Importantly, the anergic T cells in SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> and normal aged mice are confined to a specific subset of CD44<sup>high</sup> T cells, and the proportions are drastically increased in SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice that have developed frank leukemia (our unpublished observation). Studies have demonstrated that tumor-specific T cells are anergized in hosts bearing experimental tumors with potent immunogenicity, albeit they may be efficiently generated ([Williamsy and Blankenstein, 2005](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0506898102)). Understanding the mechanisms of T cell anergy in tumor-bearing hosts may be crucial for controlling malignancy, and SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice should provide a reliable model to investigate the interaction between the immune system and the naturally occurring tumor factors *in vivo*.
3.4. B Cell Development and Self-Tolerance

Rap1 is activated by BCR stimulation in B cells as well (McLeod *et al.*, 1998). While it has been reported that BCR-induced Rap1 activation inhibits PI3K-dependent AKT activation without affecting ERK activation in a B cell line (Christian *et al.*, 2003), the physiological role of the effect remains unknown. A unique role of the Rap1 signal in development and function of B-lineage cells *in vivo* has again been uncovered using SPA-1 knockout (KO) mice. SPA-1 KO mice show preferential increases in peritoneal B1a cells (CD5<sup>+</sup> Mac-1<sup>+</sup> B220<sup>+</sup> IgM<sup>high</sup>) with aging, accompanied by development of antinuclear antibodies such as anti-dsDNA antibody (Ishida *et al.*, 2006). While autoantibodies are of the IgM class in young SPA-1 KO mice, significant IgG and IgA autoantibodies develop in elder mice to eventuate characteristic lupus-like immune complex glomerulonephritis (Ishida *et al.*, 2006). It has been documented that B1a cells are responsible for the production of anti-dsDNA antibodies. Peritoneal B1a cells of SPA-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice displayed marked accumulation of Rap1GTP and were actively cycling, indicating that the cells were activated by constitutive self-antigens *in vivo*. Rather surprisingly, however, the SPA-1<sup>-/-</sup> peritoneal B1a cells did not show enhanced proliferation via BCR stimulation, instead a rather compromised response was manifested. Thus, unlike hitherto reported many mutant mice that developed lupus-like autoimmune diseases, autoimmunity in SPA-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice is not attributed to intrinsic BCR-hyperreactivity of B cells.

B cells of SPA-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice, however, revealed significantly altered BCR repertoire of the Vk genes as compared to those of control mice (Fig. 3). Studies have indicated that unexpectedly high proportions of the newly emerged immature B cells (>50%) in BM are autoreactive (Wardemann *et al.*, 2003) and receptor-editing plays a major role in negating the autoreactivity (Casellas *et al.*, 2001). Receptor-editing primarily involves Ig light (L)-chain genes taking advantage of the fact that Vk/Jk gene rearrangements may occur repetitively unlike Ig heavy chain genes because of the absence of D gene segments. OcaB, which controls the recombination and expression of selected Vk genes as a transcriptional cofactor of Oct1,2, plays a crucial role in receptor editing (Casellas *et al.*, 2001, 2002). It has been revealed that the Rap1 signal induces transcriptional activation of OcaB via p38MAPK-dependent Creb activation in B cells, and in fact immature BM B cells of SPA-1<sup>-/-</sup> mice with excessively enhanced Rap1GTP levels exhibit augmented OcaB gene expression (Ishida *et al.*, 2006). The results suggest that the Rap1 signal generated by the ligation of BCR with self-antigens in self-reactive immature BM B cells may play a role in receptor editing via OcaB gene activation. The expected consequences of excessive Rap1 activation in SPA-1<sup>-/-</sup> immature B cells might be twofold: (1) it may cause skewing of the Vk gene usage toward

Figure 3 Rap1 signal may function as a “self-sensing” signal in immature bone marrow B cells and control the editing of self-reactive BCR. Self-reactive immature B cells in BM are tolerated by several distinct mechanisms including clonal deletion and receptor editing. On stimulation with self-antigens, they may undergo repetitive rounds of Vk-gene expression and rearrangement until the self-reactivity of BCR is negated by a new Igk chain (editor Vk), viz., complete receptor editing. Rap1-mediated p38MAPK-dependent OcaB gene activation plays an important role in the expression and rearrangement of selective Vk gene. With excess Rap1 activation in the absence of SPA-1, repetitive Vk-gene rearrangement may proceed to Vλ-gene rearrangement, leading to allelic inclusion of Ig light chain genes. Such partial receptor editing may generate B cells with significantly reduced yet potential self-reactivity. Such partially receptor-edited B cells are delivered preferentially to certain privileged sites, such as the peritoneal cavity, to become B1a (CD5⁺ CD11a⁺) cells. Since these B1a cells retain potential self-reactivity, they may progress to produce pathogenic autoantibodies (such as anti-dsDNA IgG) following class switching and affinity maturation once triggered in the periphery. Repetitive stimulations of the B1a cells by constitutive self-antigens may also predispose them to B1-cell leukemia resembling human B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) associated with autoantibody production.

the Vk genes with higher OcaB dependency (such as the most frequently utilized Vk4 gene in mouse anti-dsDNA antibodies; Liang et al., 2003), a finding which in fact has been demonstrated in SPA-1⁻/⁻ mice (Ishida et al., 2006); and (2) excessive Rap1 signals may abnormally accelerate Vk gene recombination and expression in SPA-1⁻/⁻ self-reactive immature B cells. Normally, receptor editing is completed by rearrangement and expression of rare editor Vk genes to replace
the Vκ genes involved in self-reactive BCR. Excessive Rap1 signals and sustained OcaB overexpression, however, may result in incessant Vκ gene rearrangements with ineffective editing (due to the preference for particular Vκ genes), eventually leading to Vλ gene rearrangement and expression. In fact, significant proportions of the peritoneal B1 cells in the SPA-1 KO mice revealed an allelic inclusion (*Ishida et al.*, 2006), expressing both the Vκ-IgL and Vλ-IgL-chains indicative of “partial editing” (*Fig.* 3). The results suggest the important role of Rap1 in mediating the “self-sensing” signal downstream of BCR in the newly derived immature BM B cells.

The origin of B1 cells has long been a matter of argument. In mice, the polyspecific B1 cells are supposed to have originated at the embryonic stage and subsequently segregated in the peritoneal cavity, where they can be self-renewed (*Hayakawa* and *Hardy*, 1988). Such B1 cells play important roles in innate immunity against bacterial infections by producing natural IgM antibodies broadly reactive to the various bacterial antigens (*Coutinho et al.*, 1995). Although it has been known that pathogenic autoantibodies in systemic autoimmune diseases are also derived preferentially from B1 cells, their exact origin remains largely unresolved. B cells expressing transgenic anti-dsDNA BCR, for instance, are segregated and distributed in marginal zones rather than in the follicles of spleen (*Li et al.*, 2002). Previous report also suggested that VH gene usage might primarily determine the B1/B2 fates of the B cell development using VH gene transgenic models (*Lam* and *Rajewsky*, 1999). Thus, the unique features of pathogenic autoreactive B cells being defined as B1 cells may be primarily attributed to BCR-specificity per se rather than to distinct lineage. B1 cells in SPA-1−/− mice exhibit remarkably high expression levels of β1-integrin (unpublished results), and the Rap1 signal may as well control the unique distribution pattern of B1 cells having potentially pathogenic autoreactivities.

Notably, a minor portion of SPA-1−/− mice (ca. 10%) eventually developed characteristic leukemia of CD5+ Mac-1+ B220+ phenotypes corresponding to B1a cells with hemolytic autoantibodies (*Ishida et al.*, 2006). Marked increases in CD5+ B cells with high frequencies of autoimmunity (such as hemolytic anemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia) are a hallmark of human B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), and thus B cell leukemia in SPA-1−/− mice is highly reminiscent of human B-CLL. Furthermore, leukemic B cells in some SPA-1−/− mice revealed chromosomal translocation involving the Igλ-chain gene, *t*(2;6), and Igκ-chain gene, *t*(2;16) (*Ishida et al.*, 2006). We therefore propose that enhanced receptor editing and persistent stimulations by constitutive self-antigens of self-reactive B1 cells may have predisposed them to the eventual leukemic transformation. Dysregulated Rap1 signals in the B-lineage cells may provide a link between autoimmunity and B-CLL (*Fig.* 3).
# 3.5. Lymphocyte Migration and Homing

Lymphocytes generated and matured in primary lymphoid organs continuously emigrate via the blood circulation to specific secondary lymphoid tissues. Homing of naive lymphocytes to particular areas in the secondary lymphoid tissues and migration of primed or effector lymphocytes to local tissues where antigens exist are crucial events in immunosurveillance. Attraction of lymphocytes by specific chemokines and transendothelial migration plays a major role in the lymphocyte migration and homing to secondary lymphoid organs. The first step of chemokine-induced transendothelial migration is the rolling of lymphocytes via selection followed by firm adhesion to endothelial cells against shear flow in response to specific chemokines (Butcher and Picker, 1996; Springer, 1995). The latter depends on integrin (LFA-1, VLA-4) activation and strong adhesion to their ligands (ICAM-1, VCAM-1) expressed on endothelial cells (Wittchen *et al.*, 2005). Chemokine gradient induces the polarized accumulation of integrins at the leading edge, while CD44 is mobilized to the uropod (Katagiri *et al.*, 2003; Shimonaka *et al.*, 2003). This polarity is vital for subsequent lymphocyte migrations across the endothelial cells (diapedesis). The direct interaction of LFA-1 with JAM-1, another Ig superfamily (IgSF) protein located at the apical part of the endothelial adherence junction near the TJ, is also involved in diapedesis and may "unlock" the homotypic intercellular junction to guide the lymphocytes during transmigration (Ostermann *et al.*, 2002).

Stimulation of the lymphocytes with specific chemokines (e.g., SLC and SDF-1) causes rapid Rap1 activation, and all the events required for transendothelial migration (including adhesion, polarization, and diapedesis) are potently inhibited by overexpression of SPA-1 or a dominant-negative Rap1 mutant, indicating the essential role of Rap1 signals (Shimonaka *et al.*, 2003). Recent reports have indicated that a Rap1 effector (RapL) plays a major role in lymphocyte migration (Section 1.2.2). RapL⁻/⁻ mice show significant atrophies of the secondary lymphoid organs associated with increased circulating lymphocytes, indicating their impaired homing to lymphoid organs (Katagiri *et al.*, 2004). Furthermore, RapL⁻/⁻ mice have indicated reductions of matured T cell migration from the thymus as well as impaired migration of the skin DCs to regional LNs by inflammatory stimuli (Katagiri *et al.*, 2004). These results thus clarify the essential roles of the Rap1 signal in constitutive and inflammation-induced lymphocyte migrations and trafficking.

In a human-inherited disease called leukocyte adhesion deficiency (LAD) syndrome, affected patients show persistent leukocytosis and life-threatening bacterial infections due to defective leukocyte adhesion to blood vessels and transmigration. Of the various subtype LAD patients, a majority (type-I LAD) indicates germline mutations with impaired expression and function in the

$\beta 2$-integrin (CD18) gene (*Anderson and Springer, 1987*). A clinical encounter with a rare autosomal recessive LAD syndrome (type-III LAD), where $\beta 2$-integrin expression and intrinsic adhesive activities of lymphocytes are apparently normal, has added an intriguing dimension to the complexity of LAD syndrome (*Alon and Etzioni, 2003*). The lymphocytes from type-III LAD patients display severely compromised Rap1-mediated integrin activation in response to chemokines, although chemokine receptor signaling per se as well as PMA-induced Rap1 activation remains normal (*Kinashi et al.*, 2004). While the reasons for impaired Rap1 activation in response to chemokines and the relevant causative gene remain to be identified, the results strongly suggest that functional defects in chemokine receptor-coupled Rap1 activation are responsible for type-III LAD syndrome in humans.

## 4. Rap1 Signal in Hematopoiesis and Leukemia

SPA-1 is most prominently expressed in the BM, in particular in the immature hematopoietic cell population, implicating a requirement of tight control of Rap1 signal in them. Analysis of SPA-1 KO mice disclosed unexpected yet important role of the Rap1 signal in regulating normal hematopoiesis (*Table 1*).

### 4.1. Hematopoietic Stem Cells and the Niche

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) fulfill two opposing features: viz., per se self-renewal without differentiation and the ability of differentiating to all lineages of mature blood cells. Constitutive hematopoiesis depends on the homeostatic balance of HSCs between self-renewal and differentiation. Accumulating evidence indicates that HSCs homeostasis is maintained by intimate interactions of HSCs with a specific hematopoietic microenvironment called the niche (*Calvi et al.*, 2003; *Whetton and Graham*, 1999; *Zhang et al.*, 2003). The role of Rap1 in maintaining stem cells in the niche has been well illustrated by the male germ stem cells (GSCs) of *Drosophila*. In testes of the fruit fly, a cluster of 10–12 cells (or “hub”) forms the niche for GSCs (*Fuchs et al.*, 2004). When a GSC divides, one daughter cell remains anchored to the hub cells, while the other drifts away from the hub and differentiates to form a gonialblast. Hub cells produce growth factors, such as Upd (*unpaired*) and Gbb (*glass bottom boat*), to regulate self-renewal of GSCs, which have previously anchored to the hub through DE-cadherin-mediated cell adhesion to receive these signals (*Yamashita et al.*, 2003). A genetic study has revealed that the defect of Rap1 GEF (Gef26) or Rap1 causes the reduced formation of adherens junctions at the hub–GSC interface, resulting in GSC loss due to exhaustive differentiation (*Wang et al.*, 2006). Thus, the Rap1 signal plays a major role in maintaining GSCs in the niche.

In mouse BM, spindle-shaped N-cadherin<sup>+</sup> osteoblastic cells on the surface of cancellous or trabecular bone are the primary candidates of niche stroma for HSCs (Zhang *et al.*, 2003). A previous study has demonstrated that c-Myc-deficient HSCs with enhanced expression of N-cadherin and integrins are markedly accumulated in the niche with reduced differentiation. On the contrary, c-Myc overexpression accelerates the HSC release from the niche and thereby promotes their differentiation to eventuate stem cell exhaustion (Wilson *et al.*, 2004). Thus, the control of HSC adhesive molecules may play a crucial role in maintaining HSCs in a niche microenvironment to regulate the signals for homeostatic balance between self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs (Fig. 4). SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice consistently display gradual increases of HSC counts in BM with aging to eventually suffer overt myeloproliferative disorders (MPDs; see below). Furthermore, the diseased SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice have revealed marked increases in the HSC population excessively expressing LFA-1, resulting in premature HSC mobilization out of BM to subsequently induce massive extramedullary hematopoiesis (Kometani *et al.*, 2006). These results indicate that control of the Rap1 signal by SPA-1 is crucially involved in the regulation of HSC interaction with the niche.

SDF-1 produced by BM stroma cells is a major chemotactic factor involved in HSC migration and homing to a hematopoietic microenvironment (Nagasawa *et al.*, 1996). The expression of SDF-1 receptor (CXCR4) on human CD34<sup>+</sup> hematopoietic progenitors is reportedly enhanced by the cAMP-induced Rap1-signal (Goichberg *et al.*, 2006). The Rap1 signal also plays a major role in SDF-1-mediated activation of β1-integrins (Shimonaka *et al.*, 2003), which is essential for migration and homing of HSCs to the hematopoietic microenvironment (Potocnik *et al.*, 2000). We recently found that HSCs overexpressing SPA-1 or dominant-negative Rap17A mutant showed reduced engulfment when transplanted into irradiated mice compared with control cells (our unpublished data). Therefore, Rap1 is most likely involved in HSC migration and homing to BM microenvironments or the niche, which is essential for the successful human BM transplantation.

## 4.2. Dysregulated Rap1 Signal and Myeloproliferative Disorders

A vast majority of SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice eventually developed marked peripheral leukocytosis and massive splenomegaly with extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis in their second year (Ishida *et al.*, 2003a; Kometani *et al.*, 2004; Fig. 4). Although well-differentiated granulocytes usually predominated in the blood of these mice, CFU-C assays have revealed increases in hematopoietic cells of all lineages, suggesting inductions of dysregulated expansion and differentiation of multipotent hematopoietic progenitors. A significant proportion of SPA-1<sup>−/−</sup> mice additionally

Figure 4 Control of homeostatic hematopoiesis by Rap1 and myeloid leukemia in SPA-1 deficiency. Self-renewal and differentiation of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are controlled by the intimate interaction with niche stroma cells in BM via coordinated balance of adhesion molecules, including N-cadherin (N-Cad) and migratory integrins such as LFA-1 (A). SPA-1 is a principal Rap1GAP expressed in HSCs and multipotent hematopoietic progenitors (MHPs), and persistent Rap1 activation in SPA-1⁻/⁻ HSCs and MHPs results in their accelerated expansion and differentiation. In addition, SPA-1⁻/⁻ MHPs show strong expression of LFA-1, and prematurely abandon the bone marrow to initiate extensive extramedullary hematopoiesis in the spleen. SPA-1⁻/⁻ mice eventually develop myeloproliferative disorders (MPD) that resemble chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in the chronic phase. During the process, blast crisis may occur at any committed hematopoietic progenitors (CHP) to cause either myeloid or lymphoid acute leukemia. Rap1 is constitutively activated in such blast cells as well and may play a significant role in their aggressive

accommodated variable extents of blastic cells of either myeloid or lymphoid lineages, which infiltrated in vital tissues (Ishida *et al.*, 2003a). These features highly resemble human CML in the chronic phase and acute crisis. In addition, a minor portion of mice developed severe anemia and pancytopenia often associated with dysplastic or blastic leukocytes, and the phenotypes coincided well with the human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). The latent periods of MPD were usually long (ca. 12 months), and secondary genetic events might affect the final disease phenotypes, especially in blast crisis. Despite the apparent diversity of MPD, diseased SPA-1${}^{-/-}$ mice share common features, including accumulation of Rap1GTP in the HSC-enriched BM cell fraction, selective increase in HSC population with excessive LFA-1 expression in BM, and marked HSC mobilization to the spleen (Kometani *et al.*, 2006). Altogether, these findings strongly suggest that HSC disorders are the causative factors underlying MPD (Fig. 4).

CML represents leukemia of HSCs, and leukemic stem cells generate increasing numbers of various types of mature blood cells (Ren, 2005). Similarities and differences between normal and leukemic HSCs are the fundamental issue in CML pathogenesis. Although it has been reported that enhanced self-renewing capacity of HSCs in several mutant (such as Lnk${}^{-/-}$, c-Myc${}^{-/-}$, and p18INK4C${}^{-/-}$) mice yields marked increases in the HSC population, these mice do not develop overt MPD (Takaki *et al.*, 2002; Wilson *et al.*, 2004; Yuan *et al.*, 2004). On the other hand, a report has indicated that conditional deletion of *Pten* gene in HSCs result in the development of acute MPD (Yilmaz *et al.*, 2006; Zhang *et al.*, 2006a). Pten is a phosphatase that converts PIP${}_{3}$ to PIP${}_{2}$ and negatively regulates the PI3K-signaling pathway (Cully *et al.*, 2006). Pten${}^{-/-}$ mice indicate progressive reductions in self-renewing HSCs due to their accelerated differentiation and peripheral mobilization, resulting first in massive extramedullary hematopoiesis rapidly followed by blast crisis in association with frequent chromosomal translocations (Yilmaz *et al.*, 2006; Zhang *et al.*, 2006a). The overall features of MPD in conditional Pten${}^{-/-}$ mice resemble those of SPA-1${}^{-/-}$ mice, except for more acute development in the former. Thus, the accelerated drive of HSCs in differentiation and premature mobilization (with or without the reduced self-renewing HSCs) seems to be the common features of CML-like MPD, and it would be of interest to investigate whether SPA-1${}^{-/-}$ and Pten${}^{-/-}$ mice, in part, share the dysregulation of signaling pathways in HSCs, particularly the PI3K–AKT pathway.

invasion into many vital tissues. In humans, the *BCR-ABL* fusion gene from the Philadelphia chromosome is a major cause of CML and constitutive Rap1 activation downstream of BCR-ABL oncoprotein may participate in molding phenotypes of human CML.

In humans, the vast majority of CML is caused by BCR-ABL oncoprotein generated by chromosomal translocation $t(9;22)$. All lineages of matured peripheral leukocytes have an identical chromosomal anomaly, indicating that MPD is due to the leukemic transformation of an HSC clone (Wong and Witte, 2004). BCR-ABL protein delivers a diverse array of signals via constitutive ABL tyrosine kinase activity, including the Ras–ERK, PI3K–AKT, and Stat5–Bcl2 pathways, as well as integrin activation (Jin et al., 2006; Sonoyama et al., 2002; Wong and Witte, 2004). Although all these signals may contribute to various aspects of leukemic features, the PI3K pathway apparently plays a prominent role in terms of leukemogenesis *in vivo* because the BCR-ABL mutant gene (lacking a domain responsible for PI3K activation) then loses the leukemogenic activity (Sattler et al., 2002). Evidence has indicated that Rap1 is activated constitutively by BCR-ABL via recruitment and phosphorylation of C3G (Cho et al., 2005), or partial repression of SPA-1 gene expression (Kometani et al., 2006), or both. Most notably, SPA-1 overexpression has significantly inhibited PI3K/AKT activation in BCR-ABL${}^{+}$ cells (Jin et al., 2006). To directly examine the role of Rap1 signals in BCR-ABL-induced CML, we compared the leukemic phenotypes between the normal and SPA-1${}^{-/-}$ progenitors transduced with BCR-ABL oncogene in a mouse model. The findings demonstrated that, while both progenitors caused CML in the primary recipients, SPA-1${}^{-/-}$ leukemic progenitors persisted longer than the control *in vivo* when judged by the serial transfer experiment (Kometani et al., 2006). In addition, significant proportions of the former showed blastic crisis, supporting a role of the endogenous Rap1 signal in BCR-ABL-induced CML genesis in the recipients. In some juvenile CML patients, loss of heterozygosity in NF1 gene encoding a RasGAP has been observed (Shannon et al., 1994) and in fact NF1${}^{+/ -}$ mice have developed CML with a long latency of over a year (Jacks et al., 1994). Due to enhanced activation of the Ras–ERK pathway, NF1${}^{-/-}$ cells consequently develop hyperresponsiveness to GM-CSF (Bollag et al., 1996; Largaespada et al., 1996). In contrast, SPA-1${}^{-/-}$ CML cells show unchanged responsiveness to hematopoietic growth factors such as GM-CSF (Ishida et al., 2003a), and thus deficiencies of SPA-1 (Rap1GAP) and NF-1 (RasGAP) induce CML-like via distinctly different mechanisms.

Current literature advocates the dependence of CML-genic potential of BCR-ABL on complex interactions with the intrinsic self-renewing potential of HSCs (Huntly et al., 2004). This is of particular clinical significance because imatinib mesylate (Gleevec; a potent inhibitor of ABL kinase activity) that can rapidly reduce the massive burden of leukemic leukocytes fails to eradicate the CML stem cells, so-called residual diseases (Michor et al., 2005). Under such circumstances, most of the patients eventually develop recurrence of lethal aggressive leukemia. SPA-1 is among the gene set of the murine self-renewal-associated

signature and highly enriched in human leukemic stem cells as well (Krivtsov *et al.*, 2006), and thus it seems likely that BCR-ABL connects with the intrinsic Rap1 signal in HSC, at least in part, to cause CML. The crucial target cells for controlling CML are the leukemic stem cells (Huntly and Gilliland, 2005), and Rap1 may provide a rational molecular target for the eradication of CML in humans.

## 4.3. Role of Rap1 in Generation and Function of Platelets

Among the various blood cells, the role of Rap1 signals in generation and function of platelets has been most extensively studied (Stork and Dillon, 2005). Maturation of megakaryocytes depends on thrombopoietin acting on the Mpl receptor to induce sustained ERK activation (Garcia *et al.*, 2001). However, erythropoietin and GM-CSF induce proliferation, but not maturation, of megakaryocytes, and such an action is associated with transient ERK activation (Stork and Dillon, 2005). This represents another event where the Rap1 and Ras signals mediate the distinct modes of ERK activation to induce different effects (Section 1). BM stroma cells inhibit differentiation of megakaryocyte progenitors by direct contact, an effect which has been elicited by inhibition of Rap1-mediated persistent ERK activation (Delehanty *et al.*, 2003). A specific type of β3-integrin (αIIbβ3), which is expressed selectively by platelets, plays essential roles in platelet function (e.g., aggregation and adhesion) related with homeostasis and thrombus formation. The abundantly expressed Rap1 in platelets is activated by many stimuli (e.g., turbulence, epinephrine, ADP, thrombin, thromboxane A2, and platelet-activating factors) to cause platelet activation via αIIbβ3 activation. CalDAG-GEF I (RasGRP2) is responsible for Rap1 activation in platelets, and a report has revealed defective αIIbβ3-mediated platelet aggregation in CalDAG-GEF I⁻/⁻ mice to induce markedly impaired haemostasis (Crittenden *et al.*, 2004).

## 5. Rap1 Signal in Malignancy: New Aspects in Cancer

In spite of the highly convergent homology with classical Ras, there have been limited experimental findings implicating Rap1 to function as an oncogene. In 1998, however, Altschuler and Ribeiro-Neto (1998) have revealed certain unique roles of the Rap1 signal in cell transformation; Rap1-transfected Swiss 3T3 fibroblasts are flatter and spread more with a higher saturation density than control cells. Although cell growth could be strongly enhanced by cAMP or EGF, the Rap1-transfected cells showed no anchorage-independent growth, and thus the cells revealed no evidence of transformation *in vitro* when viewed under a classical criterion. Surprisingly, however, the cells formed tumors in nude mice

(Altschuler and Ribeiro-Neto, 1998). This presents a very unusual phenomenon, where cells are anchorage-dependent *in vitro* and yet tumorigenic *in vivo*. The results suggest that Rap1 caused tumors *in vivo* by constitutive interaction with, rather than bypassing, the intrinsic growth pathways of host cells. In principle, the event may be coincidental with BCR-ABL-induced CML-genesis, whereby BCR-ABL oncoprotein promotes the dysregulated expansion of HSCs by interacting with the intrinsic self-renewal feature of HSCs (Huntly *et al.*, 2004). According to a recent study, certain human squamous cell carcinoma cells show high levels of Rap1GTP. Rap1GAP transduction reportedly represses tumorigenesis of such cancer cells in nude mice (Zhang *et al.*, 2006b). These results suggest that Rap1 may act as a “conditional” oncoprotein.

Hitherto, the Rap1 signal has been documented to affect the invasiveness and metastasis of tumors *in vivo*. Mutations of DOCK4 gene encoding a Rap1 activator have been reported in certain human cancer cells (Yajnik *et al.*, 2003). The mutant DOCK4 protein exhibits a dominant-negative effect to incite defective Rap1 activation in such cancer cells, resulting in the loss of intercellular adhesion among these abnormal cells. As a result, these cancers would manifest highly invasive behavior *in vivo*. Intriguingly, introduction of a wild-type DOCK4 gene restores the adherence junction among the cancer cells, and concomitantly represses the invasive tendency as the basal Rap1GTP is restored (Yajnik *et al.*, 2003). It has also been reported that the Rap1 signal in cancer cells may play a critical role in metastasis. Employing the model of spontaneous development of mammary tumors in transgenic mice of polyoma middle T-antigens under an MMTV promoter, Hunter and the colleagues have indicated that genetic polymorphism of the SPA-1 (also called SIPA-1) gene in the host is a major determinant for lung metastasis of primary mammary tumors (Park *et al.*, 2005). Thus, mouse strains with SPA-1/741A alleles display extensive lung metastases, whereas far less lung metastases are observed in those with SPA-1/741T alleles. Interestingly, no significant differences in growth of the primary tumors are established between mice with a different allele. The single amino acid polymorphism at position 741 in the PDZ domain of SPA-1 protein affects Rap1GAP activity in cancer cells, with SPA-1/741A being more active than SPA-1/741T (Park *et al.*, 2005). On the basis of these findings, the reduced Rap1 signal in cancer cells might favor metastasis in addition to local invasiveness. In fact, these findings serve as the first direct indication that the host genetic background can affect the metastatic behavior of cancers (Threadgill, 2005). A report confirmed that certain SPA-1 gene haplotypes are significantly associated with the presence of lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in human mammary cancers (Crawford *et al.*, 2006). Recently, we have also confirmed that prostate cancer cells in primary

sites of patients with metastases exhibit expression of SPA-1 protein significantly higher than those without metastasis (our unpublished observation). In other words, the Rap1 signal in cancer cells may partially control malignant invasiveness and remote metastasis by regulating intercellular adhesion among the cancer cells.

# 6. Conclusions and Perspectives

Extensive and intensive studies in recent years have unveiled unique biological activities of Rap1. Two major activities of the Rap1 signal have been established: (1) control of cell–matrix and cell–cell adhesions via activation of integrins and other cell adhesion molecules and (2) regulation of the activation of various MAPKs. Rap1 is activated by an extensive spectrum of extracellular stimuli via many types of specific GEFs coupled with certain specific receptor systems, and the activation status is tightly controlled by GAPs at different intracellular compartments. Through such activities, Rap1 is involved in a range of diverse cellular functions far more than originally anticipated. Unique and unanticipated roles of the Rap1 signal *in vivo* have recently been uncovered by extensive analyses of gene-targeted mice for Rap1 regulatory molecules. The Rap1 signal has been demonstrated to play crucial roles in diverse aspects of the developments and functions of immune and hematopoietic cells. Furthermore, Rap1 dysregulation causes characteristically specific diseases, with highly resembling human conditions. We anticipate that further analyses will reveal more as of yet undocumented important roles of the Rap1 signal in other biological systems such as the nervous and endocrine systems and malignant cells. While Rap1 is expressed ubiquitously in most tissue cells in the body, predominant roles of the Rap1 signal can be highly variable—depending on the contexts of specific cell types and functions. This signaling molecule with multifaceted functional variability provides a typical example, where a ubiquitous molecule may be crucially integrated into the highly specified and sophisticated functions of many biological events in a complex living system. Regulatory molecules of the Rap1 signal may also serve as potentially reliable and rational molecular targets for controlling various human diseases including malignancy.
