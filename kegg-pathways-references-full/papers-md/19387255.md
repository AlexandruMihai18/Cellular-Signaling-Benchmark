**Purpose of review**

Over the past decades, advances in the knowledge of the molecular pathogenesis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have allowed significant improvements in the therapeutic management of this devastating disease. Several investigations have established the role of aberrant activation of major intracellular signaling pathways during human hepatocarcinogenesis. Genome-wide analysis of DNA copy number changes and gene expression led to the identification of gene signatures and novel targets for cancer treatment. Numerous attempts have tried to develop a molecular classification of HCC. This review aims to summarize the most relevant genetic alterations and pathways involved in the development and progression of HCC, providing an overview of the molecular targeted therapies tested so far in human HCC.

**Recent findings**

The discovery of sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor, as a treatment with survival benefits in patients with advanced HCC, has become a major breakthrough in the clinical management of HCC. For the first time, a molecular therapy was able to demonstrate significant efficacy for the treatment of HCC patients. New guidelines have established the ideal endpoints for the design of clinical trials for HCC. At last, a molecular classification of HCC based on genome-wide investigations, able to identify patient subclasses according to drug sensitivity will lead to a more personalized medicine.

**Summary**

In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms leading to human hepatocarcinogenesis, providing the scientific rationale for the development of new therapeutic targets.

## Introduction

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major health problem. It is one of the most common solid cancers, representing the third cause of cancer-related death and the leading cause of death among cirrhotic patients [1–3]. The incidence of HCC is increasing in Western countries, mostly because of the high prevalence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection [4,5]. Less than 40% of patients are eligible for curative treatments. The lack of efficacy of systemic chemotherapies [6–8] encouraged an intensive research to identify the molecular mechanisms implicated in human hepatocarcinogenesis. The recently published positive clinical trial [9**] testing the multikinase inhibitor sorafenib in advanced HCC has definitively established the proof-of-principle for prospective evaluation of molecular targeted therapies for HCC.

## The hepatocarcinogenic process

Extensive epidemiological evidence suggests that viral infections [either hepatitis B virus (HBV) or HCV], aflatoxin exposure, chronic alcohol intake or cirrhosis of any etiology are clear risk factors for HCC development [1]. The unbalanced geographic distribution and prevalence of these factors is the main reason for the heterogeneous incidence rates in different areas.

HCC develops on a cirrhotic liver in almost 80% of cases, and is what justifies its high molecular complexity [10,11]. HCC pathogenesis comprises a multistep process

that involves genetic and epigenetic events occurring during initiation and progression of the disease. According to this theory, external stimuli would induce alterations on mature hepatocytes or stem cells [10–12,13], leading to apoptosis, cell proliferation, dysplasia and neoplasia [11]. During the preneoplastic stage, activation of mitotic signaling pathways may confer growth advantages and induce the selection of dysplastic cell clones. These clones, organized in dysplastic nodes surrounded by connective tissue, could later acquire the malignant phenotype after exposure to additional genomic insults such as point mutations, chromosomal arm gains or losses or aberrant promoter methylation of key genes [13].

Several mechanisms have been involved in the development and progression of liver cancer, according to different etiologies. These mechanisms seem also to be relevant during preneoplastic stages and initial phases of cancer development. For instance, recent data suggest that HCV may act as a Wnt ligand, and it has also been implicated in RAS transactivation and p53 inactivation [14]. In addition, HCV infection is a major cause of cirrhosis, and several alterations associated to this condition predispose to HCC [mitogenic pathway activation as tumor growth factor alpha (TGFα), oxidative stress, immunologic alterations, NF-κB activation, among others]. The role of HBV as a carcinogen is far better established. HBV DNA integrates into the host genome, inducing genomic instability, genetic aberrations, insertions in the promoter region of tumor suppressor genes (e.g. p16) and producing oncoproteins such as HBx [15,16]. Aflatoxin B is a very potent mutagen and its active metabolite reacts with guanine in DNA leading to mutations. In geographical areas where aflatoxin B1 exposure is endemic, such as Asia and extensive areas of Africa, there is a strong association between mutations in P53 (at codon 249) and exposure to this agent [17].

Solid tumors arise after disruption of at least three critical intracellular signaling pathways, according to Vogelstein and Kinzler [12]. The disruption could be the result of point mutations, copy number alterations, epigenetic changes or inactivation of tumor suppressor genes. Depicting which of these molecular alterations are driver events or just nondominant passengers has become a major challenge in cancer research [18]. Scientific evidence suggests that there are common alterations to nearly all tumors such as telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT) activation, neoangiogenesis mainly through activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), evasion of apoptosis, insensitivity to antigrowth signals and cell checkpoint disruption [19]. In this sense, several studies have tried to identify subgroups of patients with homogeneous molecular alterations using genome-wide

approaches [i.e. microarray, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, etc.] aiming to customize personalized medicine approaches in human HCC.

### Genetic aberrations

Frequent alterations in HCC include chromosomal amplifications, loss of heterozygosity, mutations, CpG hypermethylation, DNA hypomethylation and microsatellite instability (summarized in Table 1). Several genes have been related to hepatocarcinogenesis such as *CMYC* (8q), *CCND1* (11q), *AXIN1* (16p), *P53* (17p), *CDH1* (16q) or *PTEN* (10q) among others. The most frequently deleted chromosome arms are 17p, 8p, 16q, 16p, 4q, 9p, 13q, 1p and 6q, whereas the most frequent chromosomal gains are located on 1q, 7q, 8q and 17q [13,14,20,21]. Regarding mutations, almost 30% of the HCC cases harbor mutations in P53, whereas between 14 and 44% of cases have mutations in exon 3 of the *CTNNB1* gene (responsible for aberrant WNT-βcatenin activation). Mutations in *PI3KCA*, *AXIN1* and *KRAS* are less frequent. Finally, telomerase activity is increased in the vast majority of HCCs [22]. It is needed in early stages to allow cell acquisition of limitless replicative potential. Telomerase is activated and telomere length altered in various types of cancers, including more than 80% of human HCCs. HBV integration into the *TERT* locus has been reported in human HCC indicating its role in enhanced *TERT* gene expression. Interestingly, telomerase activity is detectable in preneoplastic lesions (i.e. dysplastic nodules).

Abnormal methylation of gene promoter regions causes epigenetic silencing and inhibition of gene expression. DNA in HCC is globally hypomethylated, whereas there are certain areas, named CpG islands, with marked hypermethylation. Several reports show aberrant methylation of promoter regions of tumor suppressor genes in HCC, including *RASSF1*, *SFRP1*, *P16*, *P14* and *CASP8* (Table 1). Recent studies [10,23] demonstrate that hypermethylation of several inhibitors of RAS pathway is an important step in hepatocarcinogenesis, showing that aberrant methylation is associated with poor prognosis of HCCs.

### Signaling pathways

WNT-βcatenin signaling pathway is the most commonly disrupted pathway in HCC, basically as a result of mutations in *CTNNB1* or *AXIN1* [24], *CDH1* epigenic silencing and changes in expression of WNT receptors from the Frizzle Family [25]. Activation of this pathway induces translocation [26] of β-catenin into the nucleus, where it regulates specific oncogenes such as *CCND1*, *CMYC* and *BIRC5*. Wnt pathway is disrupted in 30% of HCC, particularly in HCV-induced HCCs, whereas almost 70% of hepatoblastomas [26].

The phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway plays an important role in liver carcinogenesis, and its activation occurs in 30–50% of HCCs. It can be dysregulated via abnormal activation of tyrosine kinase receptor [e.g. epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1R), mesenchymal-epithelial transition factor (MET), vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR), etc.] or through constitutive activation of PI3K due to loss of function of PTEN, a tumor suppressor gene (by mutations or epigenetic silencing). Loss of heterozygosity in PTEN locus (i.e. 10q) is frequent in HCC. However, unlike other malignancies, the frequency of PTEN mutation is fairly low in HCC, ranging from 0 to 11% [27]. PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway activation has been related to poor prognosis [28]. The effectiveness of mTOR blockage with rapamycin analogs has been tested in preclinical models [27] and could have important clinical implications for a subgroup of patients with activation of the pathway. Raf/Ras/Erk pathway is almost globally activated in advanced stages of liver cancer, as a result of increased signaling induced from upstream growth factors as epidermal growth factor (EGF), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) or insulin-like growth factor (IGF), and also because of inactivation of tumor suppressor genes as RAFSS1A [23].

IGF signaling is aberrantly activated in several malignancies. In HCC, IGF-IR was found to be overexpressed and activated in 20% of HCC, IGF-II expression is increased in 12–44% of samples, whereas different modulators of the pathway are significantly downregulated (i.e. IGFBP-1, 3 and 4) [29]. Several molecules blocking IGF receptor are currently under investigation [30].

HGF is a key molecule in liver regeneration [31], transmitting signals through its selective binding to the MET receptor. It is known that deregulation of both molecules is a common finding in HCC although its exact role is not yet clarified [32].

Angiogenesis is pivotal in human cancer. It is mediated by activation of different pathways in the tumor and endothelium (VEGFR, PDGFR and angiopoietin-2) [13*, 21*].

Recent trends: the role of microRNAs in hepatocarcinogenesis

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate the expression of target mRNA transcripts at a posttranscriptional level. They have been shown to be involved in a variety of cellular processes such as cell proliferation, cell differentiation, apoptosis, neuronal patterning and stem cell maintenance [33]. miRNAs are dispersed across the genome commonly disposed in gene clusters. At least 50% are found in defined introns or exons of both protein-coding transcripts, and are cotranscribed with the gene in which they reside. They can act as tumor suppressor genes or oncogenes depending on their target genes [34]. The role of miRNA in HCC development and progression is underexplored. One gene expression-based study [35] identified three overexpressed miRNA (miR-18, precursor miR-18 and miR-224) and five downregulated miRNAs (miR-199a*, miR-195, miR-199a, miR-200a and miR-125a) in HCC compared with surrounding nontumoral tissue. This miRNA expression signature was able to classify samples according to tumor status with almost 100% accuracy. Two independent studies [36,37] showed that miR-21 and miR-122 were respectively upregulated and downregulated in HCC compared with nontumoral tissue. MiR-122 was reported to target cyclin G1, and miR-21 was shown to negatively downregulate the expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN. miRNAs are often located in amplified or deleted genomic regions, so the analysis of miRNA expression together with SNP array analysis for genomic copy alterations will be helpful to detect new miRNAs with oncogenic or tumor suppressor properties. Moreover, gene expression profiles and the study of specific proteins in combination with miRNA expression analysis will provide valuable information about genomic alterations and regulatory function.

Molecular classification of hepatocellular carcinoma

There are several clinical staging systems for HCC, although none of them include biological parameters as prognosis predictors [13*]. Among them, the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) clinical classification has been endorsed by the European Association for the Study of the Liver as well as the American Association for the Study of the Liver Diseases as the standard guideline for the clinical management of HCC patients [8,38,39]. There is not a standardized molecular classification of HCC despite several attempts conducted recently [21*,40*,41,42**,43–47] using genome-wide technologies such as gene expression microarray and SNP array. However, these studies [21*,40*,41,43–47,48*,49] have identified homogeneous subgroups of patients based exclusively on molecular parameters. Ultimately, the

development of a molecular classification of HCC will facilitate the understanding of the intricate pathogenesis of this malignancy as well as to predict patient prognosis and unleash new targets for molecular therapies. Noteworthy, the design of studies aiming to obtain molecular predictors of outcome should consider the possibility of death related to liver failure due to the cirrhotic condition instead of tumor progression. To minimize this bias, it is mandatory to accurately select the cohort analyzed, preferably patients with preserved liver function (i.e. Child–Pugh class A).

There are two groups of patients consistently identified throughout different studies. These groups entail activation of WNT canonical pathway and signals related to cell proliferation [21*,40*,46]. Interestingly, Lee et al. [46] found that the gene expression of a subgroup of patients within this last class co-cluster with the gene expression of fetal hepatoblasts, speculating that these tumors could have a progenitor cell origin. Another classification recently developed using gene expression data and DNA copy number changes [21*] identified a new subgroup of HCC patients (~10%) characterized by broad gains in chromosome 7. Figure 1 summarizes Chiang’s classification and its overlap with others previously reported.

Molecular targeted therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma

During the past years, there has been a remarkable improvement of the knowledge of the molecular basis underlying liver carcinogenesis, which has allowed the identification of novel molecular targets and the design of therapeutic approaches aimed at overcoming this devastating disease. The vast majority of these drugs interfere with signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and survival. On the contrary, some therapeutics are addressed to block those signals related to neoangiogenesis, a key feature of the malignant phenotype in HCC. Table 2 ([50–93]) displays the most relevant studies that are currently evaluating molecular targeted therapies in preclinical models and clinical trials in HCC.

In 2007, a major breakthrough has significantly changed the clinical management of HCC. The positive results in terms of survival obtained in the phase III clinical trial that evaluated sorafenib vs. placebo in patients with advanced HCC have spurred extensive research on the molecular pathogenesis of HCC. Sorafenib, a multikinase inhibitor of VEGFR2, PDGFR, Raf-1, B-Raf and c-KIT among others, [94] had previously demonstrated efficacy in renal cancer [95]. In addition, preclinical studies demonstrated its activity in experimental models of HCC by inhibiting cell viability and inducing significant apoptosis. Data derived from the phase II trial [81]

showed the potential clinical efficacy and provided the rationale to conduct the phase III trial in 602 patients. This landmark study was stopped after the first interim analysis because of significant differences in survival favoring the treatment arm (10.7 vs. 7.9 months in sorafenib and placebo group, respectively). Thereafter, sorafenib was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicine Agency (EMEA) for the treatment of patients with advanced HCC, and hence, it became the new standard of care for those patients [96].

Several molecular therapies have been tested in phase II trials, and are summarized in Fig. 2 [96], including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors blocking different molecular targets such as EGFR, IGF-1R, c-MET, VEGFR, PDGFR, among others. As per EGF signaling, tyrosine kinase inhibitors erlotinib, gefitinib and the dual blocking molecule against EGFR and Her2/nu, lapatinib have been assessed

in HCC. Erlotinib showed inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in experimental models of HCC [50,51]. In the clinical setting, the lack of controlled trials jeopardizes our ability to drive definitive conclusions of its role in HCC management [52,53]. Gefitinib seemed to have certain efficacy in preclinical models of HCC [55,56], but only the results of one study [54] have been reported showing no evidence of antitumoral activity. Although Her2/neu overexpression in HCC is infrequent, lapatinib is currently being tested in HCC on the basis of encouraging results observed in preclinical studies [60]. The mAb cetuximab has shown antiproliferative and proapoptotic properties in some preclinical studies [58]; however, the available clinical data do not show a clear effect [59] showing some contradictory results, so its role still remains uncertain [57].

Regarding IGF signaling, it has recently reported that this pathway is activated in 20% of HCC [30] and therapies targeting this pathway have been scarcely tested in

clinical trials in HCC [30,62]. The mAb IMC-A12 have shown efficacy in abrogating IGF-1R activation in HCC cell lines as well as in a xenograft model, in which it demonstrated efficacy in delaying tumor growth and improving mice survival. A phase II clinical trial has already started in patients with advanced liver cancer.

A very attractive field of drug development in HCC is that related to inhibitors of angiogenesis. HCC is a hypervascular malignancy and there is frequent over-expression of angiogenic factors such as VEGF, PDGF or angiopoietin. In fact, VEGF and PDGF are among the targets blocked by sorafenib. Different studies are currently evaluating the role of numerous antiangiogenics in experimental models and clinical trials in HCC. Results of the mAb bevacizumab showed some activity in terms of stabilizing disease, but unfortunately, several major adverse effects have been reported, mostly related to gastrointestinal bleeding [63-66]. Other antiangiogenic multikinase inhibitors are currently being tested in early (cediranib, PI-88 and TSU-68) and advanced (brivanib and sunitinib) clinical investigations [67-74].

The PI3K/Akt/mTOR axis emerges as another target of interest for drug development. Very recently, it has been reported that the effector molecule RPS6, a surrogate of mTOR signaling, is aberrantly activated in 50% of HCCs [27]. As mTOR inhibitors are already being used as immunosuppressant drugs in liver transplant, there is an increasing interest of testing these compounds as first-line therapy for immunosuppression after liver transplant due to HCC [27,84-86].

Preclinical evidence also gives rationale to block other signaling pathways implicated in liver carcinogenesis such as WNT or Hedgehog. Compounds targeting these signaling pathways are still under early phases of clinical development. Also, it seems that combination therapies should be the next step in molecular targeted therapies, as the blockade of complementary pathways is expected to improve the results of monotherapy.

Regarding clinical trials for HCC, a group of experts has recently developed guidelines to optimize clinical trial design in HCC [97**]. This particular scenario frequently entails two different diseases in the same patient: HCC and liver cirrhosis [97**]. This consensus encouraged the use of time-to-progression (TTP) as the endpoint in randomized phase II trials, whereas survival remains as the main endpoint in phase III investigations. TTP is a

Integrative genomic analysis of 103 HCV-related HCCs, including data from SNP array, gene-expression profiling, analysis of mutations and immunohistochemistry. Unsupervised analysis identified five molecular subclasses, three of which agree the formerly reported activation of β-catenin (CTNNB1), proliferation and interferon-related genes. A new subclass, distinguished for gains in chromosome 7 was identified.

time-to-event endpoint able to capture clinical benefit associated with survival, even in the absence of objective responses. Patients assigned to the control arm should receive the established standard-of-care therapy. Finally, knowledge concerning novel findings in terms of biomarkers and molecular data should be integrated in trial design, in order to optimize the selection of candidates and identify potential drug responders.

knowledge about targets in HCC suggests that combination of agents targeting different kinases will be the appropriate strategy to manage the disease in the near future. Furthermore, a molecular classification of HCC will allow the improvement in understanding of molecular pathogenesis and the identification of novel targets for treatment of HCC providing clinicians with unique tools to apply personalized medicine in this setting.

### Conclusion

The exhaustive research on molecular biology of HCC over the past years has highlighted important therapeutic targets for this disease, providing the rationale to develop new effective treatments. The positive result in terms of survival obtained with sorafenib has modified the therapeutic approach to this disease. However, the current
