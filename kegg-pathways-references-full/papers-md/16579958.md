### Abstract

*Artemisia annua* (Asteraceae) is the source of the anti-malarial compound artemisinin. To elucidate the biosynthetic pathway and to isolate and characterize genes involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids including artemisinin in *A. annua*, glandular trichomes were used as an enriched source for biochemical and molecular biological studies. The sequencing of 900 randomly selected clones from a glandular trichome plasmid cDNA library revealed the presence of many ESTs involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis such as enzymes from the methylerythritol phosphate pathway and the mevalonate pathway, amorpha-4,11-diene synthase and other sesquiterpene synthases, monoterpenoid synthases and two cDNAs showing high similarity to germacrene A synthases. Full-length sequencing of the latter two ESTs resulted in a 1686-bp ORF encoding a protein of 562 aa. Upon expression in *Escherichia coli*, the recombinant protein was inactive with geranyl diphosphate, but catalyzed the cyclization of farnesyl diphosphate to germacrene A. These results demonstrate the potential of the use of *A. annua* glandular trichomes as a starting material for studying isoprenoid biosynthesis in this plant species.

*Artemisia annua* L., a member of the Asteraceae, is an annual herb that is widely distributed in Asia, Europe, and North America. For centuries, the aerial parts of this plant species have been used in traditional Chinese medicine as a remedy against fever. In the seventies of the last century the active compound was identified as artemisinin, an endoperoxide sesquiterpene lactone. In a number of biochemical studies the artemisinin biosynthetic pathway has been established [1,2]. In addition, several groups have reported the molecular cloning of amorpha-4,11-diene synthase, the gene encoding the first step in artemisinin biosynthesis [3–5]. However, *A. annua* contains a series of other monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes and a number of other terpene synthases catalyzing the formation of different terpene structural types have also been isolated. The first sesquiterpene synthase that was cloned from *A. annua* was the epi-cedrol synthase [6,7], followed by the already mentioned amorpha-4,11-diene synthase [3–5] and β-caryophyllene synthase [8]. Recently, Picaud et al. [9] cloned an (*E*)-β-farnesene synthase from *A. annua*.

All the above mentioned sesquiterpene synthases have been cloned starting from cDNA libraries or by using similarity-based approaches on total RNA isolated from *A. annua* leaves. However, in *A. annua* as in many aromatic plants, terpenoid biosynthesis is strongly coupled to glandular trichomes [10,11]. Therefore, we decided to use *A. annua* glandular trichomes as an enriched material for

biochemical and molecular biological studies. The isolated
secretory cells are capable of converting farnesyl diphos-
phate (FDP)² into a number of different sesquiterpenes,
including amorpha-4,11-diene and they have been shown to
be enriched in enzymes related to the early steps in artemis-
inin biosynthesis [2].

To investigate the biosynthesis of sesquiterpenes, includ-
ing artemisinin in *A. annua*, we decided to isolate total
RNA from the glandular trichomes and use it for the con-
struction of a plasmid cDNA library. The evaluation of
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from this plasmid cDNA
library revealed the presence of a number of clones encod-
ing putative isoprenoid biosynthesis related enzymes. Here
we report on the cloning, heterologous expression and par-
tial characterization of a germacrene A synthase from a
glandular trichome specific cDNA library of *A. annua*.

**Materials and methods**

**Plant material, substrates and reagents**

Seeds of *A. annua* L. (Asteraceae) of Vietnamese origin
were obtained from Artecef BV (Maarssen, The Nether-
lands). Plants were grown in a greenhouse in 5L plastic
pots containing potting compost at 21/18°C (16/8 h). Natu-
ral daylight was supplemented with artificial light (SON-T
AGRO) during high-temperature period, and fertilizer was
applied as required. \[^3^H]FDP was obtained from Amer-
sham Biosciences (Piscataway, NJ, USA). Unlabelled gera-
nyl diphosphate (GDP) and FDP were purchased from
Sigma–Aldrich (Sigma–Aldrich, Chemie b.v., Zwijndrecht,
The Netherlands) and were used after a buffer change as
described by [12] for farnesyl diphosphate. Unless other-
wise stated, reagents were obtained from Sigma–Aldrich.
DNA sequences were assembled and analyzed using DNA-
STAR software (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA).
Sequence reagents were supplied by Perkin-Elmer (Foster
City, CA, USA). Restriction and modifying enzymes were
purchased from Gibco-BRL (Invitrogen Corporation,
Breda, The Netherlands). DNA fragments were isolated
from agarose gel by a GFX™ PCR DNA and Gel Band
Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences). Amino acid
alignments were done with Clustal X 1.83, with Gonnet 250
matrix and default settings.

**Intact gland feeding experiments**

About 15 mg glands were re-suspended in 1 ml assay
buffer containing 25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% (v/v) glycerol,
10 mM MgCl₂, 6 mM Na₃VO₄, and 2 mM DTT. Twenty
micromolars unlabelled FDP were added to the assay along
with 2.2 × 10⁶ dpm \[^3^H]FDP. The samples were overlaid
with 1 ml pentane and incubated for 2 h at 30°C in a water
bath with gentle shaking. Each assay was then extracted
twice with 1 ml ether:pentane (1:4) and the organic phase
was filtered through a small glass column containing 0.9 g
silica and some anhydrous MgSO₄. The column was
washed with 1.5 ml ether and the extract was carefully con-
centrated to approximately 50 μl under a stream of nitro-
gen. The samples were analyzed by radio-GC using a Carlo
Erba 4160 series GC equipped with RAGA-93 radioactiv-
ity detector (Raytest) and FID as described before [1] but
with the following temperature program: 1 min at 70°C fol-
lowed by a ramp of 5°C min⁻¹ to 240°C and a final time of
10 min.

**Total RNA isolation and cDNA library construction**

Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg *A. annua* gland
secretory cells using the SV Total RNA Isolation System
(Promega). The quality of the isolated RNA was assessed
by agarose gel electrophoresis and the quantity measured
spectrophotometrically. One microgram of the resulting
total RNA was employed to construct a cDNA library
using the SMART cDNA Library kit and following the
manufacturer’s protocols for small amounts of RNA
(Clontech, Palo Alto, California). After double strand
cDNA synthesis and introduction of *SfiI* restriction enzyme
recognition sites, the double stranded cDNA was digested
with *SfiI* and size fractionated by column chromatography
according to manufacturer’s instructions. To enhance the
fraction of full-length clones, only the first two, largest,
fractions containing detectable cDNA were employed for
library construction, using the vector pGEM-T Easy
(Promega) modified with *SfiI* sites. To introduce an *SfiI*-site
into pGEM-T Easy, a double stranded *SfiI* linker was
made. The double stranded oligo was made from *SfiI*

(5'-GGCCATTATGGCCTGCAGGATCCGGCCGCC T-3' (forward) and 5'-GGAATTCTTACACGGGGGTAG AGAAC-3' (reverse). One hundred microliters PCR mixture contained 0.4 μM of each primer, 0.3 mM dNTP, 50 ng of template, 10 μl of 10× PCR buffer, 5 U PfuTurbo DNA polymerase (Stratagene) and sterile water. The PCR was carried out using a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). The mixture was initially preheated to 94°C for 1 min, then underwent 25 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 55°C for 1 min and 72°C for 2 min. Finally, the reaction was heated at 72°C for 7 min. Following gel purification, PCR products were digested with XhoI and EcoRI and ligated into pRSET A digested with XhoI and EcoRI. The ligation was transformed to *E. coli* DH5α competent cells (Invitrogen). Isolated DNA from bacterial colonies was fully re-sequenced to check if the gene was integrated in the right frame without mutations. A small amount of plasmid DNA was also used for digestion with XhoI and EcoRI and checked with gel electrophoresis for correct subcloning. Plasmid DNA of the clone AaGAS and the control (original pRSET A vector) were transformed to BL21-(DE3)-RIL competent cells according to the manufacturer's recommendations (Stratagene).

For induction of expression, single colonies of the BL21 transformations harboring the putative sesquiterpene synthase and the empty pRSET A vector were picked from the LB 100 mg L⁻¹ ampicillin plates containing 1% glucose, transferred to 1 ml LB broth supplemented with 100 mg L⁻¹ ampicillin and 1% glucose and grown overnight at 37°C (250 rpm). Aliquots of 0.5 ml were then used to inoculate 250 ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 50 ml LB broth with ampicillin (50 μg ml⁻¹). The cultures were grown at 37°C with vigorous shaking to OD₆₀₀ = 0.5. For induction of expression 1 mM isopropyl β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added and the cultures were grown at 16°C overnight with shaking at 250 rpm. Then the cells were centrifuged at 1000 g for 15 min at 4°C and the pellet was resuspended in 1 ml assay buffer containing 15 mM Mops, pH 7.0, 10% glycerol, 1 mM ascorbic acid, 2 mM DTT, 0.1% Tween 20, 6 mM Na₃VO₄, 10 mM MgCl₂, and 1 mM MnCl₂ and then disrupted by sonication. The sonicated mixture was centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min at 4°C and the supernatant used directly for enzyme assays.

### Sequence analysis

About 900 clones from the *A. annua* glandular trichome cDNA library were randomly picked, amplified using T7 and SP6 primers and partially sequenced from their 5'-end using the T7 primer. Half a microlitre of the colony PCR products was employed directly for sequencing using Ready Reaction Dye Terminator Cycle Mix (Perkin-Elmer) and 100 ng of T7 primer. Sequencing PCR was performed according to manufactures recommendations (Perkin-Elmer) in a GeneAmp PCR System 9700 Thermocycler (Applied Biosystems). After purification the samples were sequenced on a ABI 310 capillary sequencer (Perkin-Elmer). After removal of vector and poor quality sequences, the resulting *A. annua* ESTs were compared with GenBank using the BLASTX search algorithms of the NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/blast.cgi) [13]. Sequences were assembled into contigs using the Seqman II module of the DNASTAR software package (DNASTAR, Inc., Madison, WI, USA).

### Cloning and functional expression of the putative germacrene A synthase in *E. coli*

After sequencing, two clones showed high similarity to germacrene A synthases isolated from other plant species. One of these clones proved to be full-length and it was used for heterologous expression in *E. coli*. After subcloning in a bacterial vector, full-length sequencing reactions were run across the vector/insert junction to ensure proper integration. The same analysis was done on the original clone subcloned into pGEMT-Easy plasmid. Design of several internal primers allowed the complete sequencing of the cDNA encoding the putative sesquiterpene synthase. The full-length sequences were obtained using Amplitaq DNA polymerase and FS cycle sequencing on an ABI Prism™ 373 DNA Sequencer.

To determine the biochemical function, the native clone AaGAS was amplified by PCR and the construct was incorporated into pRSET A vector (Invitrogen) by introducing an XhoI site (CTCGAG) upstream of the start codon and a EcoRI site (GAATTC) downstream of the stop codon. The XhoI and EcoRI sites were introduced by PCR using the

### Enzyme assay

For each enzyme assay 500 μl of the lysate were diluted to 1 ml total reaction volume using the MOPSO assay buffer described above and using 5 μM FDP or 5 μM GDP as substrates. The assays were overlaid with 1 ml of pentane and incubated at 30°C for 1 h with gentle shaking. All assays were performed in duplicate. After incubation the assays were vigorously mixed and following a short centrifugation the pentane phase from each sample was removed and loaded on a short aluminum oxide column overlaid with anhydrous MgSO₄. The assay mixture was re-extracted with 1 ml pentane:diethyl ether (1:4), which was also passed over

the column, and the column washed with 1.5 ml diethyl ether. The combined fractions were concentrated to 50 μl under a gentle stream of N₂ and analyzed using GC–MS, equipped with an HP-5MS column (30 m × 0.25 mm i.d., 0.25 μm film thickness) and programmed at an initial temperature of 55°C for 4 min, with a ramp of 10°C min⁻¹ to 280°C and final time of 10 min. To check for temperature-rearrangement, analysis was done using an injection port temperature of 250°C as well as 150°C [12].

**Results and discussion**

**Artemisia annua glandular trichome isolation and essential oil analysis**

Gland secretory cells were obtained in a good yield by using the glass-bead abrasion technique applied for other plant species [14,15]. Microscopic analyses revealed the presence of a fair amount of 10-celled biseriate glandular trichomes as previously described by Duke et al. [10,16]. The purity of these preparations was quite high since the only contamination was represented by fragments and some non-glandular surface hairs (data not shown). The volatile profile of pentane/ether extracts of the glandular trichomes analyzed by GC–MS revealed the presence of many monoterpenoids and sesquiterpenoids including putative intermediates in artemisinin biosynthesis. The major monoterpene was identified as camphor, followed by linalool (Fig. 1). The main sesquiterpenes were identified as selina-4,11-diene, germacrene D, β-farnesene, germacrene A (identified as a β-elemene because of Cope rearrangement at high injection port temperature [12]) and amorpha-4,11-diene. These terpenoids were demonstrated to be also present in the essential oil extracted from *A. annua* leaves [1].

Intact gland cell clusters were then incubated in the presence of \[^{3}H\]FDP and products of conversion were analyzed by radio-GC and GC–MS. Radio-GC analysis showed a large radio-labelled amorpha-4,11-diene peak, indicating that the conversion from FDP to amorpha-4,11-diene occurred (Fig. 2). In addition, a second peak, corresponding to germacrene A was observed (Fig. 2). These results confirm that glandular trichomes from *A. annua* contain the enzymatic machinery for essential oil production as it was also demonstrated for other aromatic plants such as mint [14] and basil [15].

**EST sequence analysis and database searching**

Total RNA, extracted from the secretory cells, was subsequently used to make a plasmid cDNA library. The titer of this library was \(1.0 \times 10^4\) colony forming units (cfu/ml). The average insert size, based on PCR analysis of 96 individual clones, was estimated to be about 1200 bp. Sequencing of these 96 clones revealed the presence of four cDNAs with high similarity to genes involved in isoprenoid biosynthesis: geranyl diphosphate synthase small subunit (GenBank Accession No. AF182827 [17]), δ-cadinene synthase (GenBank Accession No. Y16432 [18]), linalool synthase (GenBank Accession No. AF154125 [19]), and a sesquiterpene cyclase (GenBank Accession No. AJ271792 [20]). Because of these promising results, we decided to (partially) sequence about 900 randomly selected clones from their 5′-ends. Of these, 765 clones gave high quality sequences. After editing to remove vector sequences and poor quality 3′-end sequences the average size for the resulting ESTs was approximately 600 bp. This value is comparable with the EST size calculated from other gland cDNA libraries [14,15]. Fragment assembly identified a total of 459 contigs.

Of these, 158 contigs (34.4%) contained two or more ESTs, whereas 301 (65.5%) contained only a single unique sequence (39.4% of total ESTs). One hundred forty-seven contigs (32.2%) were of low redundancy (2–4 sequences per contig), 8 contigs (1.74%) were of medium redundancy (5–10 sequences per contig) and only 3 contigs (0.65%) were of high redundancy (11–43 sequences per contig). In comparison to the mint [14] and the basil gland libraries [15], the cDNA library from *A. annua* glandular trichomes contained a larger number of unique sequences and a relatively low redundancy, suggesting that the *A. annua* glands have a higher complexity at the biochemical and molecular level in comparison to the glandular trichomes of mint and basil (see also below).

ESTs were then analyzed for sequence homologies using the BLASTX algorithm and they were assigned functions based on highest similarity, and categorized into five general functional groups (Fig. 3). About 47% of the clones encoded proteins and enzymes involved in primary (amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, glycolysis, photosynthesis, and pentose phosphate pathway) and secondary metabolism (isoprenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis) with secondary

metabolism accounting for about 12% of metabolism-related clones. About 4% of the clones belonging to secondary metabolism encoded enzymes involved in flavonoid biosynthesis (4-coumarate-CoA ligase, *p*-coumarate 3-hydroxylase, flavonol synthase, flavonol-4-reductase, flavonoid-3′-5′-hydroxylase, and flavonol-*O*-methyltransferases). Up to 8% of the clones involved in metabolism encode enzymes and proteins related to isoprenoid biosynthesis (Table 1). This is a smaller fraction than in the peppermint glandular trichome library in which 25% of the ESTs were estimated to be involved in essential oil biosynthesis [14]. This is likely due to the fact that the basal cells of the *A. annua* glandular trichomes contain photosynthetically active chloroplasts—in contrast to the mint trichome cells that were completely devoid of chlorophyll [21]—which may be indicative of the presence of more general, primary, metabolism in addition to isoprenoid biosynthesis. Up to 3% of the *A. annua* trichome ESTs encoded proteins involved in photosynthesis, with chlorophyll *a/b*-binding protein being the highest expressed single cDNA.

Among the clones related to isoprenoid biosynthesis we found a number of sequences already isolated from this plant species before, but starting from whole leaf tissue. This includes linalool synthase [19], β-pinene synthase (GenBank Accession No. AF276072, [22]), and farnesyl diphosphate synthase (GenBank Accession No. AF112881, [23]). Amorpha-4,11-diene synthase was found as a singleton. Also a PCR using amorpha-4,11-diene synthase specific primers and the first strand cDNA employed for the library construction as a template showed a clear band of expected size, confirming that at least the first gene involved in artemisinin biosynthesis is expressed in the glandular trichomes (data not shown). In addition, we found ESTs related to the plastidic methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway and the cytosolic mevalonate (MVA) pathway. The presence of both pathways that are supposed to be involved in monoterpenoid (MEP) and sesquiterpenoid (MVA) biosynthesis agrees with the presence of both groups of compounds in trichome extracts such as the monoterpenes camphor and linalool and the sesquiterpenes germacrene A, germacrene D, β-farnesene, selina-4,11-diene, amorphadiene (and, of course, artemisinin) (Fig. 1). The stronger representation of the MEP-pathway in the ESTs (Table 1) despite the fact that *A. annua* mainly produces sesquiterpenoids, may indicate that the MEP-pathway—in addition to the formation of monoterpenoids such as camphor and linalool (Fig. 1)—is also involved in the production of precursors for sesquiterpene biosynthesis in this plant species. This has been reported before for example for sesquiterpenes in chamomile [24] and lima bean [25]. More recently, the cross-talk between the two pathways was also demonstrated in *Arabidopsis thaliana* [26].

Our results are particularly significant when compared to those obtained with an *A. annua* total leaf cDNA library. The random sequencing of 4,224 clones from mRNA isolated from *A. annua* leaves resulted in the identification of just one clone involved in terpenoid biosynthesis [27]. Moreover, this clone was shown to encode epi-cedrol synthase, a sesquiterpene synthase that was already cloned from *A. annua* before but which could not be attributed any functional role *in planta* [6,7].

Another group of ESTs of high abundance was represented by lipid transfer proteins (10%) (Fig. 3). These proteins are believed to be involved in the transport of lipophilic molecules, such as essential oils, between different cell compartments and they were found in high abundance also in other glandular trichome cDNA libraries from aromatic plants [14,15]. A lipid transfer protein was also the most abundant EST in a *Medicago sativa* glandular trichome cDNA library [28]. A significant number of ESTs (31%) could not be assigned any putative function since they showed no similarity to any entry in the databases (11%) or because they showed similarity to unknown genes from other species (20%). This is in accordance with the results obtained with other gland cDNA libraries [14,15,28].

Among the isoprenoid biosynthesis related clones, two cDNAs showed significant sequence similarity with germacrene A synthases from chicory [29] and lettuce [30] reported in GenBank (Table 1). One of the two clones was full-length and it was used for heterologous expression in *E. coli.*

### Sequence analysis

Full-length sequencing of the clone *AaGAS* resulted in a 1689-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 562 amino acids showing all the motifs common to the sesquiterpene synthase family [31], such as the RPxxxxxxxxW motif at the N-terminal end of the sequence, and the (DDxxD) divalent metal ion-substrate binding motif that is highly conserved in terpene synthases [32]. According to the targeting signal prediction program PREDO TAR version 0.5 (http://www.inra.fr/Predotar) the predicted protein contained no cleavable transit peptide for plastid localization,
indicating that the germacrene A synthase has a cytosolic localization as expected for a sesquiterpene synthase. The *A. annua* germacrene A synthase falls within the *Tps-a* subfamily of the terpenoid synthases [31,33], that mainly consists of angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases [34,35].

Comparison of the deduced amino acid sequence of the *A. annua* germacrene A synthase with germacrene A synthases from other plant species showed a fairly high degree of similarity (Fig. 4A). In particular, AaGAS displays 81% similarity to germacrene A synthases from *Cichorium intybus*, CiGASsh, and *Lactuca sativa*, LsLTC1 and LsLTC2, but only 68% to the *C. intybus* CiGASlo. This is probably due to the fact that CiGASlo has a stretch of additional amino acids at the N-terminal, missing in AaGAS. The deduced amino acid sequences were further analyzed by the neighbour joining (NJ) method to infer the phylogenetic relationship between *A. annua* germacrene A synthase and sesquiterpene synthases from other plant species deposited in the NCBI GenBank. Fig. 4B shows the phylogenetic tree where the *A. annua* germacrene A synthase clusters into a separate group with the germacrene A synthases isolated from two other plant species belonging to the Asteraceae: *L. sativa* and *C. intybus*. Remarkably, AaGAS displays a higher similarity to these germacrene A synthases from different plant species than to the other sesquiterpene synthases isolated from *A. annua* whereas the germacrene A synthase cloned from another Asteraceae, *Solidago canadensis*, groups with these other *A. annua* sesquiterpene synthases. It is intriguing that the ability of *A. annua*, *L. sativa* and *C. intybus* to produce germacrene A diverged early during evolution from the ability to produce other sesquiterpenes in Asteraceae. An interesting exception is that *S. canadensis* evolved germacrene A biosynthesis independently. The other germacrene A synthases grouping with AaGAS are all involved in sesquiterpene lactone formation [12,29] whereas AaGAS is not. That is, *A. annua* does not contain any eudesmanolides, guaianolides, and germacranolides, sesquiterpene lactones that have been shown to be derived from germacrene A [12]. Interestingly, other *Artemisia* species, such as *Artemisia absinthium*, do contain the germacrene A derived guaianolides such as the extremely bitter dimer guaianolide absinthin ([http://www.ggiz-erfurt.de/pdf/pub_qt_giz_absinth_2004.pdf](http://www.ggiz-erfurt.de/pdf/pub_qt_giz_absinth_2004.pdf)). It is an intriguing question whether the functional role of germacrene A derived sesquiterpene lactones that are present in other Asteraceae in *A. annua* was replaced by artemisinin or artemisinin-pathway intermediates.

Pogostemon cablin germacrene A synthase (PcGAS) is grouped far away from the other germacrene A synthases. Functionally it is relevant that it groups together with Solanaceous (tobacco, pepper, potato, and tomato) sesquiterpene synthases such as epi-aristolochene synthase and vetispiradiene synthase that produce germacrene A as an enzyme-bound intermediate en route to their end-product [29]. The Solanaceous sesquiterpene synthases group together closely, with the exception of the tomato epidermal germacrene C synthase that clusters with the peppermint (*Mentha x piperita*) germacrene C synthase. The other two peppermint sesquiterpene synthases, β-farnesene synthase and the recently isolated cis-muuroladiene synthase [36], cluster together and have diverged relatively early from the other angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases (Fig. 4B).

Finally, the gymnosperm sesquiterpene synthases isolated from *Abies grandis* group in a separate cluster that diverged at an early stage from the angiosperm sesquiterpene synthases, as has been previously reported [31].

### Functional expression of the putative germacrene A synthase in *E. coli*

The putative germacrene A synthase was functionally expressed in *E. coli* BL21-DE3-RIL cells. This strain contains the RIL-plasmid for expression of tRNA codons that are rare in *E. coli*, to give better expression and accumulation of the protein. Crude extracts of *E. coli* expressing the cloned sesquiterpene synthase displayed a high activity when incubated with FDP as substrate. GC–MS analysis of the reaction products demonstrated that the cDNA encoded an enzyme able to convert FDP to a single sesquiterpene product. At a GC–MS injection port temperature of 250°C this product was identified as β-elemene (Fig. 5B), which was not produced in the reaction with the soluble fraction of *E. coli* harbouring the empty vector (Fig. 5A). However, from previous experience it was known that the presence of β-elemene usually is indicative of the formation of germacrene A that is rearranged upon GC–MS analysis using a high injection port temperature due to Cope rearrangement [12]. When analyzed using a lower injection port temperature of 150°C almost no Cope rearrangement occurred and a broad peak of germacrene A was detected (data not shown), confirming that the enzyme is a germacene A synthase [12].

Many sesquiterpene synthases are characterised by the generation of one dominant product (>80% of total terpenes produced) along with traces of a varying number of side-products [4]. However, we were able to detect only a single product showing that the *A. annua* germacrene A synthase is highly specific, just as the *C. intybus* germacrene A synthases [29]. The enzyme was active only with FDP and not with GDP (data not shown).

Germacrene A is one of the constituents of the essential oil extracted from *A. annua* leaves and trichomes (Fig. 1) [1] and is one of the major products, along with amorpha-4,11-diene, in the trichome-specific enzyme assay using FDP as substrate (Fig. 2) This demonstrates that AaGAS is not an unimportant gene and that germacrene A is not a side product of an another sesquiterpene synthase (Fig. 5B).

Evidence for germacrene A synthase activity in plants has already been reported [12] as well as the cloning and characterization of genes encoding this enzyme from different plant species [29,30,37]. This is not surprising since there are many natural products derived from oxidative metabolism of germacrene A [12]. For example, germacrene A is the first dedicated intermediate in the biosynthesis of bitter sesquiterpenoids of chicory [12,29] and lettuce [30]. Ger-

Fig. 4. (A) Alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of germacrene A synthase from *A. annua* and germacrene A synthases isolated from several other plant species. AaGAS: *A. annua* germacrene A synthase (GenBank Accession No. DQ447636); CiGASsh, *C. intybus* germacrene A synthase (short form) (GenBank Accession No. AF498000) [29]; CiGASlo, *Cichorium intybus* germacrene A synthase (long form) (GenBank Accession No. AF497999) [29]; ScGAS, *S. canadensis* germacrene A synthase (GenBank Accession No. AJ304452) [37]; LsLTC1, *L. sativa* germacrene A synthase (GenBank Accession No. AF489964) [30]; LsLTC2, *L. sativa* germacrene A synthase (GenBank Accession No. AF489965) [30] The alignment was created with the Clustal X 1.83 program and standard settings. Shading indicates conserved identity for the aligned amino acids: black background shading indicates 100% conservation, dark grey shading indicates 80% conservation, and light grey shading indicates 60% conservation. (B) Phylogenetic analysis of *A. annua* germacrene A synthase and sesquiterpene synthases isolated from other plant species. Scale bar, 0.1 is equal to 10% sequence divergence. The divergence calculations are based on amino acid sequences.

In the present study, we used isolated *A. annua* gland secretory cells for cDNA library construction. The random sequencing of about 900 clones indicates that *A. annua* glandular trichomes indeed express genes with functions in production of secondary metabolites (terpenoid and flavonoid biosynthesis). This material provides a superior source for the retrieval of biosynthetic genes when compared to previous studies that used whole leaves as a starting material [27]. Our approach led to the cloning of a germacrene A synthase and this is the first time that the isolation of a sesquiterpene synthase from *A. annua* glandular trichomes has been reported.

Our results show that the use of isolated gland secretory cells is a good tool for studying isoprenoid metabolism in *A. annua*, which is particularly relevant for unraveling artemisinin biosynthesis. The cloning of artemisinin biosynthetic genes should help in obtaining better production systems for this important anti-malarial medicine. The random sequencing of 900 ESTs has provided a number of candidate artemisinin biosynthetic genes that we are currently further characterizing.
