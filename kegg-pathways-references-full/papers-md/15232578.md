NOVEL THERAPEUTIC APPROACHES FOR HEART FAILURE BY NORMALIZING CALCIUM CYCLING

Xander H. T. Wehrens and Andrew R. Marks*

Congestive heart failure is the leading cause of death in the Western world. Abnormal intracellular calcium (Ca²⁺) handling is central to the pathogenesis of heart failure because it contributes to a decrease in ventricular contractile function. Chronic hyperactivity of the sympathetic nervous system causes increased phosphorylation of the ryanodine receptor intracellular Ca²⁺-release channel, a key Ca²⁺-handling protein in the heart, by protein kinase A. Alteration of the structure and function of ryanodine receptors contributes to defective intracellular Ca²⁺ handling and an increased propensity for cardiac arrhythmias in failing hearts. Novel therapeutic strategies are now being evaluated to specifically correct defective Ca²⁺-handling in heart failure.

**MYOCYTES**  
Muscle cells that contract rhythmically in the heart.

**SYSTOLE**  
The phase of the cardiac cycle during which the ventricles contract.

**DIASTOLE**  
The phase of the cardiac cycle during which the ventricles are relaxed.

Heart failure (HF) is the leading cause of death in the United States. This syndrome affects about 2–3% of the total population, with a prevalence of 5 million individuals¹. The most common cause of HF is coronary artery disease, followed by hypertension and valvular pathologies. Following an initial cardiac insult accompanied by impaired contractility, ventricular remodelling (changes in wall thickness and/or volume) and activation of the sympathetic nervous system activity occur as compensatory responses to maintain cardiac output. Although these responses initially support cardiovascular homeostasis, they eventually lead to increases in oxygen and energy consumption, structural abnormalities (for example, chamber dilatation and fibrosis) and functional abnormalities (for example, reduced contractility), which ultimately impair the ability to pump blood and can deteriorate into overt HF.

During HF, cardiac contractility is impaired by abnormalities in the structure and function of molecules responsible for the rhythmic release and reuptake of calcium (Ca²⁺) ions within the MYOCYTES². In the past five years, important new insights have been obtained into the molecular basis of defective Ca²⁺ cycling in failing hearts. Attractive new therapeutic targets have emerged.

**Ca²⁺ cycling in the normal heart**  
The term excitation-contraction (EC) coupling describes the process of converting electrical depolarization of the plasma membrane to contraction of the cardiomyocyte³. The release of Ca²⁺ from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) in the cardiomyocyte initiates contraction of the heart during SYSTOLE. The subsequent reuptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR or extrusion from the cytoplasm enables relaxation of the heart during DIASTOLE (FIG. 1).

**Release of intracellular Ca²⁺ during systole.** The contractile force in cardiomyocytes is determined by the amplitude of the Ca²⁺ transient generated by SR Ca²⁺ release via intracellular Ca²⁺ release channels/ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2)⁴,⁵. Depolarization of the plasma membrane during the cardiac action potential causes the activation of voltage-gated L-type Ca²⁺ channels (LTCC, or dihydropyridine receptors) in the sarcolemmal membrane encompassing the TRANSVERSE (T) TUBULES. Additional Ca²⁺ can enter via the T-type Ca²⁺ channels (TTCC)⁶ or the Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX) in its reverse mode⁷. The ensuing Ca²⁺ influx then triggers a much greater Ca²⁺ release from the SR via RyR 2 through a process called Ca²⁺-induced Ca²⁺ release

REVIEW S

Phosphorylation of the Ca²⁺ channels and pumps by PKA is the downstream event in a signalling cascade that begins with activation of β-adrenoceptors on the plasma membrane by CATECHOLAMINES. This allows for the activation of adenylate cyclase by specific G proteins, leading to increased cytosolic levels of cAMP and activation of PKA¹⁵. Once activated, PKA directly phosphorylates important Ca²⁺-cycling proteins, including LTCCs, RyR2 and PLB. Activation of the β-adrenoceptor signalling pathway increases EC COUPLING GAIN, thereby increasing the amount of Ca²⁺ released by RyR2 per amount of trigger Ca²⁺ entering the cell through LTCC (FIG. 2)¹⁶. This signalling pathway, also known as the FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE, is highly conserved in evolution and allows for the rapid enhancement of cardiac contractility during exercise or stress⁵.

There is ample evidence that CaMKII is important in regulating EC coupling in the heart¹³,¹⁷–¹⁹. An increase in heart rate increases CaMKII activity in the heart, which can result in phosphorylation of LTCCs¹⁷,²⁰, RyR2¹³,¹⁹ and PLB by CaMKII¹³,²¹–²³. The functional effects of phosphorylation of these key Ca²⁺-handling proteins by CaMKII includes an increase in contractile force (for example, a positive force–frequency relationship)¹³. More rapid release and reuptake of Ca²⁺ provides more time for diastolic filling of the ventricles at higher heart rates¹⁸.

Recent work by Molkentin et al.¹⁴ has identified PKC-α as a fundamental regulator of cardiac contractility and Ca²⁺ handling in myocytes. The Ca²⁺/phospholipid-dependent PKC exists as a family of at least 12 distinct isoforms²⁴. The conventional PKC isoforms (α, βI, βII and γ) are activated by Ca²⁺ and lipids, whereas the novel (δ, ε, η and θ) and atypical (ζ, ι, ν and λ) PKC isoforms do not require Ca²⁺ for maximal activation. Activation of angiotensin-II (AngII) receptors, α₁-adrenoceptors and endothelin-1 receptors (ET-1R) has been shown to stimulate PKC via Gq-coupled phospholipase C (PLC)²⁵,²⁶. PKC-α is the predominant PKC isoenzyme expressed in the heart²⁷. PKC-α can directly phosphorylate protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (I-1), augmenting the activity of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and causing hypophosphorylation of PLB¹⁴. Decreased PLB phosphorylation could result in inhibition of SERCA2a and impaired Ca²⁺ reuptake into the SR (FIG. 2).

**Structure and function of RyR2**

RyR2 is the predominant isoform in the heart and has an essential function in EC coupling²⁸. RyRs are homotetrameric channels located on the SR membrane²⁹. Each RyR monomer comprises a 560-kDa molecule, characterized by an enormous N-terminal domain protruding into the cytosol, and a smaller C-terminal domain containing the transmembrane segments (FIG. 3). The N-terminal domain serves as a scaffold for channel modulators, which regulate the function of the C-terminal Ca²⁺-conducting pore region. An array of channel modulators are bound to the cytoplasmic scaffold domain, including calmodulin (CaM)³⁰, the channel-stabilizing protein **calstabin2** (the 12.6-kDa, also known as FKBP12.6)³¹, PKA¹², PP1 and PP2A (and their target ing proteins³²), CaMKII¹³,³³ and sorcin (FIG. 3)³⁴.

Figure 1 | Excitation–contraction coupling in the heart. Excitation–contraction (EC) coupling in the heart involves depolarization of the transverse tubule (T-tubule), which activates voltage-gated L-type Ca²⁺ channels (LTCC). The small amount of Ca²⁺ influx through LTCC triggers a large-scale Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) through ryanodine receptors (RyR2). The increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentration will induce muscle contraction. To enable relaxation, intracellular Ca²⁺ is pumped back into the SR via SR Ca²⁺-ATPase (SERCA2a), which is regulated by phospholamban (PLB), or extruded from the cell via the Na⁺/Ca²⁺-exchanger (NCX).

(CICR)⁸. The tenfold increase in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ concentrations during systole results in actin–myosin cross-bridge formation that is activated by Ca²⁺ binding to troponin C. This results in displacement of tropomyosin, myofilament movement and contraction of the myocyte.

**Removal of cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ during diastole.** Myocardial relaxation during diastole is initiated by the removal of Ca²⁺ from the cytoplasm, which results in deactivation of the contractile machinery. Cytosolic Ca²⁺ is pumped back into the SR by sarcoplasmic reticulum ATP-ase (SERCA2a)⁹. The activity of this enzyme is regulated by the binding of phospholamban (PLB)¹⁰. In its non-phosphorylated form, PLB inhibits SERCA2a activity¹⁰, whereas phosphorylation of PLB reverses the inhibition. Cytosolic Ca²⁺ can also be expelled from the cardiomyocyte via the sarcolemmal NCX¹¹.

**Regulation of Ca²⁺ cycling in the heart**

The magnitude and timing of the Ca²⁺ transient, which determines the strength of contraction, is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation of both Ca²⁺-handling pumps and ion channels. Several kinases, including protein kinase A (PKA)¹², Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII)¹³ and protein kinase C (PKC)¹⁴ contribute to these effects (FIG. 2).

TRANSVERSE (T) TUBULE  
An invagination of the plasma membrane that contains ion channels and ion transporters that are in a close spatial relationship with ion channels on the sarcoplasmic reticulum (to enable efficient excitation–contraction coupling).

CATECHOLAMINES  
Hormones (for example, adrenaline and noradrenaline) that affect the sympathetic nervous system, produced in the medulla of the adrenal gland. Catecholamines are derivatives of the steroid catechol, which is derived from the amino acid tyrosine.

EC COUPLING GAIN  
The ability of Ca²⁺ influx through voltage-gated L-type Ca²⁺ channels to trigger Ca²⁺ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.

Figure 2 | Regulation of intracellular Ca²⁺ signalling in the heart. Several intracellular signalling pathways can increase the gain of the excitation–contraction coupling system. Agonist-activation of the β-adrenoceptor allows for activation of adenylate cyclase (AC) via specific G proteins. The subsequent generation of cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA), which can be targeted to L-type Ca²⁺ channel (LTCC) via A-kinase anchoring protein (AKAP), and ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) and Na⁺/Ca²⁺ exchanger (NCX) via muscle AKAP (mAKAP), respectively. Faster heart rates increase the average cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration, which activates Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase (CaMKII). CaMKII can phosphorylate LTCC, RyR2 (to which CaMKII is directly targeted) and phospholamban (PLB). Activation of the angiotensin-II receptor (AT-IIR), α-adrenoceptor or endothelin-1 receptor (ET-1R) activates phospholipase C (PLC) via specific G proteins, which in turn activate protein kinase C (PKC-α). PKC-α can directly phosphorylate protein phosphatase inhibitor-1 (I-1), augmenting the activity of the protein phosphatase-1 (PP1) and causing hypophosphorylation of PLB.

**FIGHT-OR-FLIGHT RESPONSE**

An evolutionarily conserved mechanism which allows for the rapid enhancement of cardiac contractility and cardiac output during exercise or sudden stress. This stress response is mediated by the activation of the sympathetic nervous system, which leads to phosphorylation of an array of intracellular proteins in the heart, including ryanodine receptor-2, by protein kinase A.

**CA²⁺-RELEASE UNITS**

Structures containing two proteins essential to EC coupling: the L-type Ca²⁺ channels (LTCC) on the plasma membrane and the ryanodine receptors (RyR2) on the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The LTCC–RyR2 complexes are organized in to lattices which allow a large population of receptors to be simultaneously switched on, or off, by a very small change in ligand concentration.

Highly conserved leucine/isoleucine zipper (LIZ) motifs in RyR2 form binding sites for similar LIZs in targeting proteins for kinases (for example, PKA) and phosphatases (for example, PP1 and PP2A) that regulate RyR function (FIG.3)³². RyR also binds proteins at the luminal SR surface (for example, triadin, junctin and calsequestrin (CSQ)). Junctin³⁵ and triadin³⁶ are presumably involved in anchoring RyR, whereas CSQ provides a high-capacity intracellular Ca²⁺ buffer³⁷,³⁸.

Calstabin2 is a peptidyl-prolyl cis–trans isomerase that binds to RyR2 with a stoichiometry of one calstabin2 bound to each RyR2 monomer. Binding of calstabin2 stabilizes the channel in the closed state during the resting phase of the heart (diastole)³¹,³⁹. In addition to stabilizing individual RyR2 channels, calstabin2 functionally couples groups of RyR2 channels to enable synchronous opening during EC coupling⁴⁰,⁴¹.

This phenomenon, called ‘coupled gating’, enables CA²⁺-RELEASE UNITS consisting of groups of RyR2 to open and close simultaneously.

**Regulation of ryanodine receptors.** A variety of cellular mediators and modifications can modulate the activity of RyR2 in the heart, including Ca²⁺, Mg²⁺, ATP, phosphorylation, oxidation and so on (for a more extensive review on RyR modulation see REF.4). Phosphorylation by PKA increases the probability that the RyR2 channel adopts an open conformation by increasing the sensitivity of RyR2 to Ca²⁺-dependent activation¹²,³⁹,⁴²,⁴³. Phosphorylation of serine 2809 on RyR2 results in the dissociation of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2 from the channel complex, which increases the sensitivity of the channel to Ca²⁺-dependent activation¹³. Recently, the CaMKII phosphorylation site on RyR2 (serine 2815)

the sensitivity to Ca²⁺-dependent activation. In contrast to phosphorylation by PKA, phosphorylation by CaMKII does not induce the dissociation of calstabin2 from the RyR2 channel¹³.

Activity of RyR2 is also regulated by protein phosphatases targeted to the macromolecular channel complex via specific adaptor proteins (FIG. 2)³²,⁴⁴. We have previously demonstrated that both PP1 and PP2A are bound to RyR2 via the adaptor proteins spinophilin and PR130, respectively³². It is believed that PP1 reduces RyR2 activity⁴⁵, although contrary results have been reported⁴⁶.

### Defective Ca²⁺ handling in failing hearts

Defective intracellular Ca²⁺ handling is central to the depressed contractility and diminished contractile reserve observed in heart failure². Cardiomyocytes isolated from failing hearts are characterized by a reduction in the systolic Ca²⁺ transient amplitude, an increase in diastolic Ca²⁺ concentrations and a slowed rate of diastolic Ca²⁺-transient decay⁴⁷,⁴⁸. These changes result in a decreased SR Ca²⁺ content and a lower EC coupling gain²,¹⁶.

Chronically elevated plasma concentrations of catecholamines contribute to the alterations in intracellular Ca²⁺ handling in patients with HF⁴⁹,⁵⁰. Chronic activation of the β-adrenoceptor pathway results in maladaptive changes in the heart, including a decrease in expression and coupling of β-adrenoceptors⁵¹,⁵², an increase in expression of the inhibitory G protein Gᵢ, a rise in the expression of the β-adrenoceptor kinase (which phosphorylates and desensitizes β-adrenoceptors)⁵³, and a decrease in expression and function of adenylate cyclase¹⁵. Downstream effects of increased intracellular kinase activity include PKA-mediated hyperphosphorylation of LTCC⁵⁴, NCX⁵⁵ and RyR2¹². Defective Ca²⁺ cycling in failing hearts can also result from the altered expression and function of proteins required for Ca²⁺ homeostasis. In failing hearts, the expression of SERCA2a and RyR2 are downregulated, and NCX expression is generally upregulated⁵⁶–⁵⁸.

**Figure 3 | Ryanodine receptor-2 is a macromolecular complex.** The ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) macromolecular complex includes four identical RyR2 subunits, each of which binds one calstabin2, as well as the phosphatases and kinases shown in figure 2 (for reasons of clarity, only one protein kinase A (PKA) is shown). Leucine/isoleucine zippers (LIZ) on ryanodine receptor-2 (RyR2) mediate binding of adaptor proteins that target protein phosphatases PP1 and PP2A, and protein kinase A (PKA) to the channel complex. PKA consists of two regulatory (RII) and two catalytic (C) subunits. Calstabin2, calmodulin (CaM), CaMKII and sorcin also bind to the cytoplasmic surface of RyR2. The encircled ‘S’ residues indicate the PKA (serine 2809) and CaMKII (serine 2815) phosphorylation sites within the RyR2 protein. Triadin and junctin have transmembrane domains and bind to the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) side of RyR2. Calsequestrin (CSQ) binds and unbinds to the triadin-junctin-RyR2 complex, depending on the SR Ca²⁺ concentration during the excitation-contraction coupling cycle.

**Box 1 | Mutations in the cardiac RyR2 linked to exercise-induced sudden cardiac death**

Sudden cardiac death is associated with common cardiac diseases and conditions, most notably heart failure (roughly 50% of heart failure patients die from fatal ventricular arrhythmias). However, fatal arrhythmias can also occur in young and otherwise healthy individuals without known structural heart disease¹⁰¹,¹⁰². Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) is an arrhythmogenic disorder of the heart characterized by stress- or exercise-induced ventricular tachycardias that lead to sudden cardiac death¹⁰³–¹⁰⁵. Affected individuals typically present during adolescence with repetitive exercise-triggered syncopal events leading to sudden cardiac death in 30–50% by 30 years of age¹⁰⁶,¹⁰⁷. Genetic linkage studies and DNA sequencing have identified mutations in the cardiac ryanodine receptor gene (hRyR2) in individuals with CPVT¹⁰⁴,¹⁰⁵.

The analysis of the biophysical properties of CPVT-mutant RyR2 channels has provided new insights into the molecular basis for the triggers that initiate arrhythmias³⁹. Under non-stimulated, resting conditions, CPVT-mutant RyR2 channels are indistinguishable from normal (wild-type) channels³⁹,¹⁰⁸, consistent with the clinical observation that CPVT patients do not develop arrhythmias at rest¹⁰⁷. However, CPVT-linked mutant RyR2 channels display abnormal single-channel function following phosphorylation by protein kinase A (for example, to mimic exercise or stress)³⁹,¹⁰⁸,¹⁰⁹. Mutant RyR2 channels also have a decreased affinity for the channel-stabilizing molecule calstabin2, compared with wild-type channels. These findings indicate that during exercise, calstabin2-depleted CPVT-mutant RyR2 channels might trigger sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca²⁺ leak, which could initiate ventricular arrhythmias³⁹. Consistent with this model is the finding that calstabin2-deficient mice consistently develop ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death during exercise-stress testing³⁹.

Ryanodine receptor dysfunction in heart failure. Chronic hyperactivity of the β-adrenoceptor signalling pathway in patients with HF leads to hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA¹²,⁵⁹,⁶⁰. Reduced levels of PP1 and PP2A in the RyR2 macromolecular complex might contribute to the maintenance of long-term hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA¹²,³². Hyperphosphorylation of serine 2809 on RyR2 results in the dissociation of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2, which causes a leftward shift in the Ca²⁺-sensitivity of the channel (for example, RyR2 is more easily activated at the same Ca²⁺ concentrations)¹². In addition, RyR2 can open aberrantly during diastole, leading to SR Ca²⁺ ‘leak’, which can result in resetting the SR Ca²⁺ content to a lower level. Decreased SR Ca²⁺ loading, in turn, reduces EC coupling gain and contributes to impaired systolic contractility¹². Increased SR Ca²⁺ leak due to impaired binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 can also lead to ventricular arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death in patients with heart failure or inherited exercise-induced ventricular arrhythmias (BOX 1)³⁹.

Novel therapeutic strategies for HF

A better understanding of intracellular signalling cascades involved in Ca²⁺ cycling in cardiomyocytes has led to the identification of several new therapeutic targets to improve systolic and diastolic function in the failing

calstabin2 and normalization of Ca²⁺ release⁶⁴,⁶⁶. Potential side effects, however, include depressed cardiac function and reduced exercise tolerance⁷²,⁷³.

We have recently shown that a genetically altered calstabin2 protein can bind to PKA-phosphorylated RyR2³⁹, indicating that stabilizing the RyR2 channel complex might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HF⁷⁴. The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519 also effectively enhances calstabin2 binding to PKA-phosphorylated RyR2 (FIG. 4; BOX 2)⁷⁵,⁷⁶. By inducing a conformational change in RyR2 that allows calstabin2 to rebind to the channel, the drug inhibited diastolic Ca²⁺ leakage from the SR, and improved contractile performance in a canine experimental model of HF⁷⁷. Moreover, we demonstrated in a genetic mouse model that JTV519 can very effectively suppress ventricular arrhythmias by rebinding calstabin2 to RyR2⁷⁵, indicating that JTV519 and its derivatives could constitute a novel class of drugs for the treatment of heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias³⁹,⁷⁴,⁷⁵, although it is not known whether JTV519 directly binds RyR2 or calstabin2.

### Enhancing SR Ca²⁺ loading

Increasing the reuptake of Ca²⁺ into the SR by stimulating SERCA2a has been proposed as an attractive approach to improving systolic and diastolic function in the failing myocardium⁷⁸–⁸⁰. Proof-of-principle experiments have been performed using adenovirus-mediated gene transfer of SERCA2a, which normalized Ca²⁺ handling and cardiac contractility in a rat model of heart failure⁷⁸. Pharmacological stimulation of the pump itself is also possible, with several compounds showing SERCA2a agonist activity *in vitro*⁸¹,⁸². The development of such pump-stimulating drugs is still

Phosphorylation of serine 2809 leads to the dissociation of calstabin2 from the phosphorylated RyR2 monomer. **b** | β-adrenoceptor blockers antagonize the β-adrenoceptor signalling pathway and decrease PKA activity in the heart, which reduces the number of serine 2809 residues phosphorylated on RyR2. Reduced phosphorylation of RyR2 by PKA will allow for increased binding of calstabin2. **c** | The drug JTV519 increases the binding affinity of calstabin2 for RyR2 (presumably by inducing a conformational change that allows calstabin2 to bind to PKA-phosphorylated RyR2; see insert). Increased calstabin2 binding and improved contractility might indirectly lead to decreased β-adrenoceptor signalling in the JTV519-treated failing heart.

Box 2 | JTV519

The 1,4-benzothiazepine derivative JTV519 was initially developed by Kaneko *et al.* to prevent cardiac cell damage due to Ca²⁺ overload<sup>110,111</sup>. The drug was found to bind allosterically to **annexin V** and inhibit annexin-V-dependent Ca²⁺ influx<sup>110</sup>. In addition, JTV519 has been reported to protect the heart against ischaemia/reperfusion-induced Ca²⁺ overload and myocardial stunning<sup>112–115</sup>.

JTV519 could also represent a very promising new drug for the treatment of heart failure<sup>76,77</sup>, as well as ventricular<sup>75</sup> and supraventricular arrhythmias<sup>116,117</sup>. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that treatment with JTV519 corrects the defective interaction between calstabin2 and RyR2 in a canine model of heart failure<sup>77</sup>. Increased binding of calstabin2 to RyR2 prevents diastolic Ca²⁺ leak from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), which is believed to underlie decreased cardiac contractility in heart failure<sup>12,75</sup>.

Using a genetic mouse model of exercise-induced cardiac arrhythmias, JTV519 was shown to very effectively prevent ventricular tachycardias and sudden cardiac death in calstabin2-haploinsufficient mice<sup>75</sup>. The finding that JTV519 did not prevent arrhythmias in calstabin2-deficient mice proves that the presence of calstabin2 in the heart is required for the therapeutic effects of JTV519 (REF. 75). Indeed, the mechanism of action is that JTV519 increases the binding affinity of RyR2 for calstabin2, and thereby prevents diastolic SR Ca²⁺ leaks that trigger arrhythmias and contractile dysfunction in heart failure<sup>12,75</sup>.

---

confined to the laboratory and no specific agents have been put forward for clinical testing. However, there are also potential inherent risks of SR Ca²⁺ overload due to SERCA2a stimulation, which could result in cardiac arrhythmias<sup>83</sup>.

Alternatively, SR Ca²⁺ reuptake might also be induced by increasing levels of PLB phosphorylation<sup>84,85</sup>, because PLB inhibits SERCA2a function in its unphosphorylated form. Other studies indicate that antisense PLB gene transfer into cardiomyocytes isolated from failing human hearts could normalize contractile function<sup>86</sup>. However, augmentation of Ca²⁺ cycling by decreasing PLB function might only be beneficial in certain forms of HF, because two inactivating mutations of PLB seem to be deleterious in humans with inherited forms of HF characterized by putative inactive PLB mutants<sup>87</sup>.

Inhibition of PKC-α has also been proposed as a pharmacological target for treating HF, because PKC-α activity is increased in failing hearts<sup>14,88,89</sup>. Antagonizing PKC-α is expected to enhance Ca²⁺ reuptake, and therefore increase the force of contraction of the myocardium<sup>90</sup>. PKC-α inhibitors would inhibit the signalling cascade downstream from the action of classic inotropic agents, so there might be fewer side effects compared with β-adrenoceptor blockers or phosphodiesterase inhibitors. Pharmacological tools to inhibit

PKC are, with very few exceptions, not isoform specific, and specific inhibitors of PKC-α have not been identified yet<sup>88,91</sup>.

Because NCX translocates ions in either direction across the plasma membrane, mode-specific inhibitors of NCX could have interesting therapeutic potential. For example, specific blockade of excessive Ca²⁺ influx via reverse-mode NCX activity might reduce Ca²⁺ overload and cardiac arrhythmias (TABLES 1,2,3)<sup>92,93</sup>. On the other hand, blockade of the forward mode might decrease excessive Ca²⁺ efflux from the cytoplasm, and improve systolic function by increasing SR Ca²⁺ loading<sup>94,95</sup>.

### Conclusion

A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying HF has led to the identification of novel therapeutic targets. Because beta-blockers have been shown to reduce mortality, patients with HF should receive a β-adrenoceptor blocker unless contraindicated. One reason why beta-blockers might be beneficial in HF is because they restore the normal structure and function of the RyR2 channel complex. Reduced PKA hyperphosphorylation of RyR2 results in rebinding of the channel-stabilizing protein calstabin2. The new drug JTV519 could also normalize intracellular Ca²⁺ release by increasing the binding of calstabin2 to RyR2. New therapies will aim to restore normal Ca²⁺ cycling in the failing heart.
