T-CELL REGULATION BY CD28  
AND CTLA-4  

Maria-Luisa Alegre*, Kenneth A. Frauwirth† and Craig B. Thompson‡  

Activation of T lymphocytes is thought to require at least two signals, one delivered by the T-cell receptor complex after antigen recognition, and one provided on engagement of co-stimulatory receptors, such as CD28. Recent studies are providing clues as to the specific signalling roles of co-stimulatory receptors. Furthermore, superimposition of inhibitory signals, such as those delivered by cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4), leads to a complex network of positive and negative co-stimulatory signals, the integration of which modulates immune responses.

T lymphocytes are central to most immune responses, and severe immunosuppression occurs in individuals or animals deficient in T cells. Recognition of specific antigens is necessary for T cells to undergo proliferation, differentiation, acquisition of effector functions and also to provide ‘help’ to other cell types that participate in the immune response, such as B cells and natural killer cells. The current model of how T cells become activated is derived from the two-signal theory of B-cell activation first proposed by Bretscher and Cohn in 1970 (REF.1), and later expanded to T cells by Lafferty and Cunningham². So, T-cell activation requires recognition of specific antigenic peptides by the T-cell receptor (TCR), as well as additional co-stimulatory signals provided by accessory surface molecules on T cells. Recently, surface receptors that inhibit T-cell activation have also been described, such that a careful balance of positive and negative regulatory T-cell signals seems to determine the fate of an immune response. The molecular mechanisms derived from such signals have been ascribed to a few principal pathways, which result in transcriptional activation required for proliferation and acquisition of effector function. Recent advances in the understanding of these pathways show the complexity of such networks and are challenging some of our preconceptions on T-cell-activation requirements.

α- and β-chains are non-covalently associated with a complex of low-molecular-mass transmembrane proteins — collectively called the CD3 complex — that initiates signal transduction after specific TCR recognition of antigen (see BOX 1). Experiments have shown that as few as 1–50 MHC–peptide complexes are sufficient to trigger lysis of target cells by CD8⁺ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)³. The MHC molecules do not need to engage all TCRs simultaneously. In fact, it is thought that MHC–peptide molecules can serially engage several TCRs, therefore progressively amplifying the magnitude of intracellular signals that eventually cross a certain threshold for activation of the T cell⁴. The relatively low affinity of TCR–MHC–peptide interactions (micromolar range) correlates with this theory of engagement–dissociation–engagement of a new receptor⁵. In addition to ligation of several TCRs, a minimal half-life of interaction between the TCR and the MHC–peptide complex seems necessary for a productive TCR signal. Experiments performed with altered peptide ligands have indicated that AGONIST PEPTIDES that can induce T-cell activation are those that mediate a longer TCR–MHC interaction, whereas ANTAGONIST PEPTIDES prevent certain half-life thresholds being reached⁶. However, a long half-life might prevent dissociation of the MHC–peptide complex from the TCR and serial engagement of additional TCRs. Kalergis and colleagues⁷ have elegantly confirmed this hypothesis by investigating the role of mutations in the antigen-binding site of the TCR. Mutations that significantly decrease or increase this half-life were shown to impair T-cell activation,

CD28 ligation might favour differentiation of T cells into IL-4-producing type-2 T helper (T~H~2) cells<sup>13</sup>, although the molecular mechanism by which this occurs is not known.

Whether the signals provided by CD28 serve to quantitatively increase TCR signals or follow distinct pathways from TCR stimulation has been the subject of controversy. CYCLOSPORINA can block TCR signals, whereas some components of CD28 signalling are cyclosporin A-independent, indicating that some signalling cascades triggered by CD28 crosslinking are independent from the TCR. At the T-cell level, CD28 ligation has been shown to reduce the number of TCRs that need to be engaged for effective cytokine production or proliferation to occur, therefore lowering the threshold for T-cell activation<sup>14,15</sup>. This is thought to occur as CD28 recruits LIPID RAFTS to the site of interaction between T cells and APCs — the immunological synapse — thereby promoting a lipid-associated increase in the local concentration of enzymes and adaptor molecules<sup>16</sup>. At the population level, engagement of CD28 has been reported to reduce the time necessary for antigenic stimuli to activate naive T cells, as well as to augment the magnitude of T-cell responses for both naive and primed T cells<sup>9</sup>. The facilitation of activation of primed T cells by CD28 depends, at least in part, on their protection from activation-induced cell death<sup>9</sup>.

leading to the concept of an optimal dwell-time between the TCR and the MHC–peptide complex for activation to occur. After engagement with antigen, the TCR becomes internalized and degraded. The extent of TCR downregulation from the cell surface seems to depend on its affinity for MHC–peptide complexes, such that agonist peptides induce more modulation than partial agonists, but is not influenced by co-stimulation<sup>8</sup>. At the population level, the duration of antigenic stimulation seems to be a crucial parameter for a productive immune response<sup>9</sup>. Therefore, naive T cells require prolonged antigenic stimulation for 20 hours in vitro before commitment to proliferation, whereas 1 hour is sufficient for previously primed T cells.

### Co-stimulation by CD28

In addition to TCR engagement by peptide, ligation of co-stimulatory molecules is also required for a productive immune response to occur. **CD28** is the best characterized and most effective co-stimulatory molecule expressed by naive and primed T cells. CD28 is a 44-kDa glycoprotein that binds to B7-1 (**CD80**) and B7-2 (**CD86**) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). TCR binding in the absence of CD28 ligation results in either apoptosis or a state of ANERGY (FIG. 1). Such anergic T cells are incapable of producing interleukin-2 (**IL-2**) or proliferating on subsequent stimulations, even in the presence of co-stimulation<sup>10</sup>. In addition, CD28 signals have been shown to increase cytokine production by T cells, both by augmented transcriptional activity and messenger RNA stabilization<sup>11</sup>. CD28 signals also promote T-cell survival by inducing upregulation of the anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family member, **BCL-X<sub>L</sub>**<sup>12</sup>. Finally, some reports indicate that

Figure 2 | Model for CD28 signalling. CD28 might associate, in its unphosphorylated state, with the serine/threonine phosphatase protein, phosphatase 2A (PP2A). On T-cell stimulation, CD28 undergoes phosphorylation on its intracellular tyrosine residues (Y), presumably resulting in dissociation from PP2A and recruitment of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (GRB2)). Activation of PI3K, which induces phosphorylation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) into phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PIP₃), might promote activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt), followed by that of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), resulting in BCL-XL upregulation that favours T-cell survival. Akt activation might also promote interleukin-2 (IL-2) production. PI3K is negatively regulated by phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN). The carboxy-terminal proline (P)-rich region might promote IL-2 production and proliferation, perhaps by recruiting and activating Lck.

into CD28-deficient TCR transgenic T cells. These reports are somewhat conflicting as to the importance of Y170 in promoting cytokine production and proliferation, ranging from no effect²⁹, to transient³⁰ or partial effects³¹. By contrast, Y170 seems absolutely required for upregulation of BCL-XL by CD28 (REFS 29,31), and mutant T cells were shown to be more sensitive to radiation-induced cell death²⁹. Impaired T-cell survival might also explain the defect of CD28-mutant T cells in mediating GRAFT-VERSUS-HOST DISEASE in an adoptive-transfer model³⁰.

Activation of PI3K results in activation of protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). Expression of a constitutively active form of Akt in TCR transgenic, CD28-deficient T cells has also been used as an approach to determine the role of PI3K downstream of CD28. Constitutively active Akt was found to be sufficient to restore production of IL-2 and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) to levels observed in wild-type T cells, although levels of proliferation, IL-4 and IL-5 production were not augmented³². This result supports a role for PI3K activation in augmentation of IL-2 and IFN-γ by CD28. However, both TCR and CD28 signals have been shown to activate Akt, such that these results might reflect enhanced TCR signalling, rather than CD28 signalling, or might reflect the lack of physiological regulation of the kinase. Interestingly, experiments performed in *Drosophila* cells indicate that Akt enhances translation of specific genes³³, indicating that increased levels of IL-2 protein in T cells transduced with Akt might result from increased translation, rather than transcription of the IL2 gene. Taken together, the results obtained in these different systems indicate that Y170 association with PI3K promotes T-cell survival and perhaps participates in CD28-dependent augmentation of IL-2 production.

Other mutations point to the carboxy-terminal proline residues 187 and 190 as regulators of CD28-induced IL-2 production and proliferation, perhaps by the association with SH3-containing proteins³¹. In fact, these proline residues have been previously shown to recruit and activate Lck³⁴, although this result has yet to be confirmed in normal T cells and these mutations have not yet been introduced as transgenes in CD28-deficient animals.

The role of GRB2 association with CD28 is also incompletely elucidated. Y170F mutations prevent association of CD28 with both PI3K and GRB2. Therefore, the results described above indicate that binding of GRB2 to Y170 is not absolutely required for CD28-mediated augmentation of cytokine production in T cells. However, transfection of Jurkat cells or of the murine T hybridoma DC 27.10 with constructs encoding CD28 or GRB2 genes with mutations that affect SH2-mediated association of GRB2, without preventing binding to PI3K, have resulted in complete ablation of IL2 promoter activity²⁶,³⁵. This indicates that there might be different regulation of these pathways in normal T cells and T-cell lines, or that PI3K might actually inhibit IL-2 production²⁷.

Serine/threonine phosphatases are involved in negative regulation of various kinases, including Akt and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades.

of the drugs or to inhibition of the association of PI3K with molecules other than CD28. Indeed, PI3Ks are heterodimeric molecules composed of a p85α, -β or p55γ SH2-containing regulatory subunit and a p110α, -β or -δ catalytic subunit that can associate with various cell-surface receptors and intracellular proteins.

Several experiments have been performed to address the role of the association between CD28 and PI3K. However, most studies have been conducted in Jurkat cells that lack phosphatase and tensin homologue (PTEN), a negative regulator of PI3K signalling²⁴. In Jurkat cells, transfection of CD28 constructs encoding a Tyr¹⁷⁰Phe (Y170F) mutation that disrupts association of CD28 with both PI3K and GRB2 had either no effect on IL-2 production²⁵, or induced a partial inhibition of co-stimulation-dependent IL2 promoter activity²⁶,²⁷. However, a similar mutation introduced into a T-cell hybridoma resulted in complete blockade of IL-2 production²⁸. Recent studies have reconstituted expression of mutant CD28 molecules in T cells either by transgenic expression of Y170F constructs into CD28-deficient mice, or by retroviral transduction

Recently, PP2A has been found to associate with the  
YMNM motif of the cytoplasmic tail of CD28 (FIG. 2)²².  
Phosphorylation of Y170 prevented this interaction.  
Therefore, unphosphorylated CD28 might be associated  
with PP2A, whereas CD28 engagement, which has been  
shown to result in CD28 phosphorylation, would promote dissociation of CD28 from PP2A and recruitment  
of PI3K and/or GRB2. In fact, inhibition of PP2A with  
okadaic acid or transfection of a DOMINANT-NEGATIVE form  
of PP2A was shown to enhance CD28-mediated IL-2  
production in Jurkat cells, indicating that PP2A might  
regulate T cells by limiting co-stimulation. Both PI3K  
and PP2A have also been found to associate with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4; **CD152**), a  
T-cell inhibitory receptor²²,³⁶. This could represent  
cross-regulation of function by the two receptors, by  
sequestering signalling machinery. Alternatively, CD28  
and CTLA-4 might have some overlapping functions.  
For example, CD28 has been reported to be a negative  
regulator of T-cell activation under some conditions³⁷,  
a function that could conceivably be mediated by PP2A.

### CTLA-4 inhibition of T cells

In addition to positive co-stimulatory molecules,  
inhibitory receptors have also been identified on T cells.  
These include CTLA-4 (REF. 38), programmed death 1  
(PD-1)³⁹⁻⁴¹ and killer inhibitory receptors (KIRs)⁴². Of  
these, CTLA-4 has been most extensively characterized.  
CTLA-4 is expressed on activated T cells, is ~30%  
homologous with CD28 and binds to the same ligands  
as CD28, albeit with a much higher affinity. This suggests  
that CTLA-4, as it becomes upregulated on activated  
T cells, might preferentially interact with CD80 and  
CD86, and therefore aid in the termination of immune  
responses. Further insight into the interactions between  
CTLA-4 and CD80/86 molecules has come from crystallization studies of CTLA-4 on its own⁴³ and in association  
with human CD80 (REF. 44) and CD86 (REF. 45). These  
studies place the binding site between CD80/86 and  
CTLA-4 distal to the homodimerization domain of both  
molecules. This allows each CTLA-4 dimer to bind a

CD80 or CD86 dimer, which creates a striking periodic  
organization that is reminiscent of a lattice or a zipper,  
and probably results in a profoundly stable interaction  
(FIG. 3). Finally, the binding of CTLA-4 to CD80/86  
might also be regulated by the surface availability of  
CTLA-4. Indeed, most CTLA-4 molecules are found  
intracellularly rather than at the cell surface, and surface CTLA-4 is rapidly endocytosed in a clathrin-dependent manner⁴⁶⁻⁴⁸, thereby limiting its engagement to CD80/86 molecules and perhaps preventing premature termination of an immune response.

CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell activation by reducing IL-2 production and IL-2 receptor expression, and by arresting T cells at the G1 phase of the cell cycle⁴⁹,⁵⁰. Moreover, mice genetically deficient in CTLA-4 expression develop a lymphoproliferative disease with progressive accumulation of T lymphocytes in peripheral lymphoid organs, as well as in solid organs, such as heart, liver and exocrine pancreas, leading to death by 3–5 weeks of age⁵¹,⁵².

The autoimmune disease in CTLA-4-deficient animals is T-cell-dependent, as interbreeding of CTLA-4-deficient mice with recombinase-activating gene (*Rag*)-deficient mice, which are devoid of T cells, prevents the disease. In addition, introduction of a fixed TCR transgene onto a *CTLA-4⁻/⁻/Rag⁻⁻* background does not restore autoimmunity, which indicates that specific antigens must stimulate T cells to mediate the lymphoproliferation of polyclonal T-cell populations observed in CTLA-4-deficient mice⁵³⁻⁵⁵. Two other manipulations have also been successful at preventing lymphoproliferation in CTLA-4-deficient mice. Depletion of CD4⁺ but not CD8⁺ T cells from birth⁵⁶ and interference with CD28-dependent co-stimulation both prevent lymphoproliferation in *CTLA-4⁻/⁻* mice⁵⁷,⁵⁸. The latter intervention has been accomplished either by treating mice with CTLA-4-immunoglobulin (a soluble form of CTLA-4 that prevents CD80 and CD86 from binding CD28)⁵⁷ or by interbreeding CTLA-4-deficient mice with CD80/86 double-deficient animals⁵⁸. Taken together, these experiments indicate that specific TCR and CD28 signals are essential to trigger the initial activation of CD4⁺ and, secondarily, of CD8⁺ T cells, and that the normal function of CTLA-4 is to stop this proliferation after T-cell activation.

Although CTLA-4 is expressed after activation of naive T cells, maximal inhibitory effects of CTLA-4 engagement are observed in primed, rather than naive, T cells⁵⁴. This is especially true in CD8⁺ T cells⁵⁵,⁵⁹, which might explain the main role of CD4⁺ T cells in initiating the disease of CTLA-4-deficient mice.

At the population level, engagement of CTLA-4 seems to reduce the proportion of cells that proliferate or secrete cytokines, rather than reduce the magnitude of the response on a per cell basis. In addition, more APCs are required for eliciting detectable cytokine production in the presence of CTLA-4 ligation⁵⁹. Taken together, these results indicate that CTLA-4 engagement raises the threshold for T-cell responses. Therefore, CD28 and CTLA-4 have opposite effects in the tuning of immune responses — CD28 decreasing and CTLA-4 increasing the threshold for T-cell activation.

Figure 4 | Model for CTLA-4 signalling. The cytoplasmic tail of cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) contains two tyrosine residues (Y) at positions 201 and 208 and a proline (P)-rich region. Y201 is contained within a YVKM motif. In its unphosphorylated form this motif allows association of CTLA-4 with AP50, the medium-chain subunit of the clathrin adaptor, AP-2. This interaction results in clathrin-dependent endocytosis of CTLA-4, therefore limiting CTLA-4 surface expression. CTLA-4 might also associate with the serine/threonine protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A), although the functional consequence of this is not known. After TCR stimulation, CTLA-4 might undergo tyrosine phosphorylation by SRC kinases, inducing surface retention. Whether Y201 requires phosphorylation for CTLA-4 to associate with phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) remains controversial. Crosslinking of CTLA-4 has been found to reduce T-cell receptor (TCR)-dependent activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase), as well as of the transcription factors nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), AP-1 and NF-AT (nuclear factor of activated T cells), and ligation of CTLA-4 during TCR stimulation results in decreased cytokine production by T cells and cell-cycle arrest. Indirect association of CTLA-4 with SHP-2 might result in dephosphorylation of the CD3 complex and subsequent inactivation of TCR-dependent signalling pathways. Alternatively, CTLA-4 might inhibit these T-cell functions by an as yet unidentified signalling pathway.

### CTLA-4 and tolerance

An exciting new body of work has implicated CTLA-4 in TOLERANCE induction *in vivo*. Blockade of CTLA-4 during systemic administration of antigen after adoptive transfer of ovalbumin-specific TCR transgenic T cells was shown to prevent tolerance induction<sup>60</sup>. Likewise, tolerance could not be induced by soluble antigen when CTLA-4-deficient TCR transgenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were used in a similar model in lieu of CTLA-4-expressing T cells<sup>61</sup>. Recently, a possible function for CTLA-4 in the regulatory role of suppressor CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells has generated widespread interest<sup>62,63</sup>, indicating another mechanism by which CTLA-4 might downregulate immune responses and a possible mechanism by which CTLA-4 might promote tolerance. Indeed, it is now clear that a fraction of mouse splenic CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells can suppress proliferation and IL-2 production of the remaining CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25<sup>-</sup> T cells. These CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells constitutively express CTLA-4 and the inhibitory effect of regulatory cells can be prevented in some settings by addition of blocking anti-CTLA-4 monoclonal antibodies<sup>62</sup>.

These inhibitory effects only require CTLA-4 to be present on the CD25<sup>+</sup> T cells<sup>62</sup>, which indicates that CTLA-4 engagement on regulatory cells might confer a suppressor function. A regulatory effect dependent on CTLA-4 would be consistent with the seminal observation that the presence of cells expressing CTLA-4 could prevent the disease mediated by transfer of CTLA-4-deficient bone marrow cells into Rag-deficient mice<sup>64</sup> — the first report to indicate regulation of neighbouring cells by CTLA-4. In addition, continuous blockade of CTLA-4 from birth was shown to result in an autoimmune syndrome in normal mice<sup>62</sup>, a finding that was attributed to inhibition of regulatory cell function. However, the role of CTLA-4 in mediating the regulatory function of CD25<sup>+</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is also becoming the subject of much controversy. First, similar induction of autoimmunity could be expected if blockade of CTLA-4 affected effector, rather than regulatory, T cells. In addition, several reports have indicated the existence of human regulatory cells that, as in the mouse, express high levels of CTLA-4 (REFS 65–68). However, blockade of CTLA-4

Box 1 | JNK activation and TCR signalling

The major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-peptide complex is recognized by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptor CD4 or CD8, which results in activation of the SRC kinase Lck and subsequent phosphorylation of immunoglobulin family tyrosine (Y)-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in the CD3 complex (Y-p). This leads to recruitment and phosphorylation of ζ-chain-associated protein (ZAP70), which phosphorylates adaptor proteins, resulting in activation of phospholipase Cγ1 (PLCγ1) and the guanine triphosphatase, RAC. PLCγ, in turn, promotes Ca²⁺ mobilization and RAS activation. The combination of these upstream events leads, by complex signalling cascades, to activation of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases: extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38, as well as phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and protein kinase B (PKB/Akt). Together, these signals promote different events, including the activation of transcription factors, which results in gene expression and, presumably, T-cell function. However, whether activation of some of the downstream signalling components is necessary for specific T-cell functions is not fully understood. Recent developments in TCR signalling have come from reports that attempted to unravel the role of JNK activation in T-cell responses by studying T cells from Jnk-deficient mice. Results have been somewhat conflicting.

**Jnk1**-deficient T cells exhibited hyperproliferation, but normal interleukin (IL)-2 production, to several stimuli in one report<sup>92</sup>, but impaired proliferation and IL-2 production in another publication<sup>93</sup>. **Jnk2**-deficient T cells showed diminished interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production in one report<sup>94</sup> and a decrease in both proliferation and production of several cytokines in another report<sup>95</sup>.

Deficiencies in both **Jnk1** and **Jnk2** or **c-Jun**, a target of Jnk activation, cause embryonic lethality. Recently, mice lacking Jnk activity in T cells have been generated by Dong and colleagues<sup>96</sup> using two different approaches. In one system, the lymphoid compartments of recombination activating gene 1 (**Rag1**)-deficient mice were reconstituted with **Jnk1⁻/⁻Jnk2⁻/⁻** embryonic stem (ES) cells. In a second system, Jnk1 activity in **Jnk2**-deficient mice was eliminated by expression of a dominant-negative form of **Jnk1**. Surprisingly, T cells from these animals showed increased IL-2 production and proliferation of naive T cells after TCR ligation, which indicates that Jnk might not be necessary for T-cell activation of naive T cells. When primed T cells were restimulated, **Jnk**-deficient T cells produced much higher levels of IL-4, IL-5, **IL-10** and **IL-13** than wild-type T cells, while maintaining similar levels of IFN-γ. The authors concluded that **Jnk** activity might prevent T helper (**Tₕ**)2 cell differentiation in normal T cells<sup>96</sup>. However, whether or not lack of Jnk might result in increased T-cell survival has not been examined. Furthermore, conditional elimination of Jnk genes in peripheral T cells will clarify the role of Jnk genes in mature T cells.

had no effect on regulatory function of these cells<sup>65,67</sup>. Finally, CTLA-4 deficient CD4⁺/CD25⁺ mouse T cells were shown to retain regulatory capacity, which indicates that other mechanisms must also be important in this suppressor function<sup>62</sup>.

Further results indicate that ligation of CTLA-4 might not be required in all cases of tolerance induction. Indeed, anergy induced by TCR stimulation in the absence of CD28 ligation *in vitro* occurs without CTLA-4 engagement<sup>69</sup>, and CD8⁺ TCR transgenic CTLA-4-deficient T cells can be anergized in a similar manner to wild-type T cells both *in vitro*<sup>69</sup> and *in vivo*<sup>70</sup>. In addition, other models of tolerance *in vivo* do not seem to depend on CTLA-4 crosslinking<sup>71,72</sup>. Whether these conflicting results reflect different requirements for CTLA-4 by different T-cell subsets (CD4⁺, CD8⁺ T cells, **Tₕ**1, **Tₕ**2), by T cells at different stages of T-cell differentiation

(naive, memory, primed T cells or clones), or depend on different modes of exposure of T cells to antigen remains to be investigated. Understanding the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which tolerance is achieved in the respective models should help decipher the specific mode(s) of action of CTLA-4.

### CTLA-4 signalling

Whether CTLA-4 inhibits T-cell responses by antagonizing CD28 (either through scavenging of CD80 and CD86 or sequestration of intracellular enzymes that can bind to both molecules), or by directly or indirectly reducing TCR signals, has been the subject of much debate. It is clear that CTLA-4 can inhibit T-cell responses in the absence of CD28 (REFS 73,74). In addition, transgenic expression of full-length CTLA-4 has been shown to completely prevent the lymphoproliferative disease

observed in CTLA-4-deficient mice, whereas expression of a tailless CTLA-4 mutant protein reduced lymphocytic infiltration of solid organs, but did not prevent T-cell activation or lymphoproliferation, which indicates that the intracellular portion of CTLA-4 does mediate inhibitory effects<sup>75</sup>. However, the partial inhibition of disease by the CTLA-4 tailless transgene, as well as results obtained with mutant CTLA-4 constructs transfected into Jurkat cell-lines, indicate that scavenging of CD80 and CD86 can also occur<sup>76</sup>. Taken together, these studies support the balanced view that CTLA-4 can inhibit T-cell activation by scavenging CD80/86 molecules away from CD28 and by direct intracellular signalling.

Similar to CD28, the 33-amino-acid-containing tail of CTLA-4 lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity. It contains two tyrosines at positions 201 and 218 in the mouse and a C-terminal proline-rich region. TCR-mediated activation of normal T cells results in phosphorylation of endogenous CTLA-4 molecules<sup>60</sup>, which indicates that tyrosine phosphorylation might be physiologically meaningful.

In its unphosphorylated form, the Y201VKM motif allows association of the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 with the medium-chain subunit AP50 of the clathrin adaptor AP-2 (FIG. 4) (REFS 46, 48, 77, 78). This interaction induces rapid endocytosis of CTLA-4. Several groups have shown that phosphorylation of CTLA-4 at Y201 results in retention of CTLA-4 at the cell surface, thereby perhaps increasing its ability to recruit CD80/86 ligands and inhibit T-cell function. A number of tyrosine kinases have been shown to phosphorylate the cytoplasmic tyrosine residues of CTLA-4 in transfection experiments<sup>79–81</sup>. These include resting lymphocyte kinase (Rlk), the Janus kinase Jak-2 and the Src family tyrosine kinases Fyn, Lyn and Lck. The functional importance of these events is unknown. Transgenic expression of a CTLA-4 protein containing a Y201V mutation in its cytoplasmic portion was shown to completely prevent the disease observed in CTLA-4-deficient mice<sup>75</sup>, which indicates that neither endocytosis nor phosphorylation of Y201 are necessary for CTLA-4 to negatively signal T cells. In addition, several groups have reported that mutations of both the Y201 and the Y218 residues in the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 do not prevent CTLA-4-inhibitory effects<sup>82–84</sup>. The Y201 residue is contained within a YVKM motif, similar to the YMNM motif of CD28, and has been shown to also recruit PI3K<sup>85</sup>. However, inhibitors of PI3K activation do not seem to counter the inhibitory function of CTLA-4, which suggests that this interaction might not be relevant for this property of CTLA-4.

On the basis that a number of proteins known to be important in TCR-mediated signalling are hyperphosphorylated in T cells from CTLA-4-deficient mice (including CD3ζ, ZAP70, SHC, Fyn and Lck)<sup>86</sup>, it has been proposed that CTLA-4 might recruit tyrosine phosphatases to the TCR. SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase (SHP-2) has been found to associate with the PI3K-binding motif of CTLA-4 (REF. 86), although this interaction might be indirect as

CTLA-4 lacks the typical sequence that can interact with SHP-2 SH2 domains<sup>87</sup>. Recent evidence has shown that CTLA-4 can co-immunoprecipitate with CD3ζ and SHP-2 in a transfection/overexpression model, which supports the hypothesis that CTLA-4 might affect TCR signals directly by bringing SHP-2 to the TCR complex and facilitating dephosphorylation of proximal signalling molecules<sup>88</sup>. However, the functional relevance of the association of CTLA-4 with SHP-2 remains controversial. For example, although CTLA-4 cannot inhibit T-cell function of naive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, endogenous SHP-2 is still found to co-immunoprecipitate with CTLA-4 in these cells, which indicates that association with SHP-2 might not be sufficient for the inhibitory effect of CTLA-4 (REF. 60). Furthermore, mutations of the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4, which should prevent SHP-2 recruitment, had no effect on the inhibitory function of CTLA-4 in different transfection systems, which indicates that the association might also not be necessary<sup>82–84</sup>. Finally, crosslinking of CTLA-4 on normal preactivated T cells had no effect on phosphorylation of CD3ζ or ZAP70 (REF. 89), which indicates that the model proposing dephosphorylation of CD3ζ by SHP-2 might not always occur. Whether these discrepancies are due to caveats of overexpression/transfection systems or to diverse mechanisms by which CTLA-4 might downregulate immune responses in different systems remains to be determined. Finally, as previously mentioned, results from a YEAST TWO-HYBRID SCREENING of a T-cell library using the cytoplasmic tail of CTLA-4 as bait have indicated that PP2A might also associate with CTLA-4 (REF. 22). Future studies might show whether this interaction has a role in CTLA-4 function.

CTLA-4 crosslinking has been shown to inhibit activation of the MAP kinases Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)<sup>89</sup>, and to result in reduced activation of several transcription factors, including NF-κB, NF-AT and AP-1 (REFS 90, 91). Both JNK and ERK are activated on serine/threonine phosphorylation and could therefore be targets for inactivation by a serine/threonine phosphatase, such as PP2A. Whether such dephosphorylating events could mediate inhibitory function of CTLA-4 remains to be investigated.

### Conclusion

Some of the molecular mechanisms underlying the requirement for second signals to activate T cells are beginning to be unravelled. T-cell activation seems to depend on an integrated network of positive and negative regulatory factors converging towards transduction of transcription factors that modulate survival, proliferation and differentiation of T cells. However, whether these pathways are absolutely required or sufficient for immune responses to occur remains to be investigated in more detail, both *in vitro* and *in vivo*. A more detailed understanding of the specificity of each pathway will be important for designing new therapies for immune enhancement in cancer patients or for specific immunosuppression for autoimmune diseases and transplantation settings.
