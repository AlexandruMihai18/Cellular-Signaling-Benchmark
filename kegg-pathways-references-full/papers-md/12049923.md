# Glucosinolate research in the Arabidopsis era

## Ute Wittstock and Barbara A. Halkier

The wide range of biological activities of products derived from the glucosinolate-myrosinase system is biologically and economically important. On the one hand, the degradation products of glucosinolates play an important role in the defence of plants against herbivores. On the other hand, these compounds have toxic (e.g. goitrogenic) as well as protective (e.g. cancer-preventing) effects in higher animals and humans. There is a strong interest in the ability to regulate and optimize the levels of individual glucosinolates tissue-specifically to improve the nutritional value and pest resistance of crops. Recent advances in our understanding of glucosinolate biosynthesis have brought us closer to this goal.

Published online: 10 May 2002

Glucosinolates (mustard oil glucosides) are nitrogen- and sulfur-containing natural plant products found mainly in the order Capparales, which includes agriculturally important crop plants of the Brassicaceae family such as oilseed rape (*Brassica napus*) and *Brassica* fodder and vegetables, and the model plant *Arabidopsis* [1]. During the past few years, the extensive use of *Arabidopsis* as a model plant has increased our understanding of glucosinolate biosynthesis. Mapping of genetic loci determining glucosinolate profiles, functional genomics, mutant screens and reverse genetics have not only complemented biochemical investigations but also, to a large extent, been the driving force of the rapid progress in the field. The identities of the first genes involved in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates were published in 2000. To date, ten biosynthetic genes from *Arabidopsis* have been identified that control reactions of the three major phases of glucosinolate biosynthesis, and the corresponding enzymes have been characterized. In addition, the identification and characterization of an epithiospecifier protein from *Arabidopsis* has added important information to our knowledge of glucosinolate catabolism by myrosinases and the accompanying proteins, and of the role of glucosinolates in plant–herbivore interactions.

### Glucosinolate-myrosinase system

Glucosinolates and the thioglucosidases (also known as myrosinases) are the main components of the glucosinolate–myrosinase system, which provides plants with an effective defence against generalist herbivores and probably also against pathogens [2–5]. Glucosinolates occur throughout the tissues of all plant organs, whereas myrosinases are localized in scattered myrosin cells, which seem to be glucosinolate free [6]. Compartmentalization of the glucosinolate–myrosinase system has been shown recently in *Arabidopsis* by the identification of sulfur-rich cells (S-cells) between the phloem and the endodermis of the flower stalk, which presumably contain high concentrations of glucosinolates [7], and by localizing myrosinase in the neighbouring cells [8].

Intact glucosinolates are nontoxic but, upon tissue damage (e.g. by cutting or chewing), they come into contact with myrosinases and are hydrolysed into unstable aglucones, which rearrange into a range of biologically active and sometimes toxic compounds, typically isothiocyanates and nitriles (Fig. 1). The nature of the hydrolysis products depends mainly on

Fig. 1. The glucosinolate-myrosinase system. (a) Examples of aliphatic, aromatic and indole glucosinolate structures. (b) Upon tissue damage, glucosinolates are hydrolysed by myrosinases. At neutral pH, the unstable aglucones rearrange to form isothiocyanates (1). If the glucosinolate side chain is hydroxylated at carbon 3, spontaneous cyclization of the isothiocyanate results in the formation of an oxazolidine-2-thione (2). In the presence of an epithiospecifier-protein-like factor, nitriles are formed (3). Nitrile formation has been shown in some cases to be favoured at low pH (pH<3). If there is a terminal double bond in the side chain, the sulfur atom released during nitrile formation is captured by the double bond, resulting in the formation of epithionitriles (4). Some glucosinolates can be hydrolysed to thiocyanates (5). Glucosinolate structures are shown in green, rearrangement upon hydrolysis is shown in pink. Abbreviation: R, variable side chain.

By monitoring natural variations in glucosinolate hydrolysis products in 122 Arabidopsis ecotypes, a gene has recently been identified whose product influences the course of the myrosinase-catalysed hydrolysis [13]. The protein encoded by this gene has high amino acid similarity to a purified B. napus epithiospecifier protein and has properties similar to epithiospecifier proteins from other species. In contrast to these, however, its presence not only causes the formation of epithionitriles from alkenyl glucosinolates but also leads to the production of simple nitriles (instead of isothiocyanates) from non-alkenyl glucosinolates. Interestingly, the principal quantitative trait loci (QTLs) associated with nitrile formation (presence of functional specifier protein) in recombinant inbred (RI) lines derived from crosses of the Arabidopsis ecotypes Columbia and Landsberg erecta were identical to those associated with feeding of the generalist herbivore Trichoplusia ni [13]. It appears from these results that T. ni prefers nitriles and dislikes isothiocyanates. If nitriles provide less protection than isothiocyanates in other herbivores as well, it is not clear why a plant would be selected to produce a protein that favours nitrile over isothiocyanate formation. However, nitriles might be directed against other pests or might attract natural enemies of the herbivores. Temporal and spatial alterations in the relative selection pressure from specialist and generalist herbivores and other pests might have maintained the

the structure of the glucosinolate side chain, but also on the plant species and reaction conditions such as pH. The presence or absence of protein factors such as epithiospecifier proteins accounts for some of the variation in the hydrolysis products. The hydrolysis products are responsible for the characteristic flavour of brassicaceous vegetables. They have different biological effects, ranging from antimicrobial and cancer-preventing to inflammatory and goitrogenic activities, and thus brassicaceous vegetables consumed by higher animals and humans have toxic as well as protective properties [9,10]. The dual roles of glucosinolates and their degradation products as deterrents against generalist herbivores and as attractants to insects that are specialized feeders on glucosinolate-containing plants have been reviewed previously [2,11,12].

Fig. 2. The chain elongation pathway of methionine. After deamination of methionine, the resulting 2-keto acid (a) is condensed with acetyl-CoA to form the 2-alkylmalic acid (b). Isomerization to the 3-alkylmalic acid (d) via the proposed olefinic intermediate (c) is followed by an oxidative decarboxylation. The reaction product (e) is a 2-keto acid elongated by one methylene group compared with the first transamination product. This 2-keto acid can undergo up to eight further cycles of chain elongation (broken arrow) or be transaminated to the corresponding methionine derivative. Reactions in the yellow circle constitute the chain-elongation cycle. Structural changes resulting from the individual reactions are highlighted in colour. Abbreviation: MAM, methylthioalkylmalate.

Glucosinolates in Arabidopsis

Arabidopsis has long been known to contain aliphatic, aromatic and indole glucosinolates [15], and has therefore served as a valuable model plant for the investigation of the biosynthesis of all three classes of glucosinolates. A recent analysis of 39 ecotypes identified 37 different glucosinolates in leaves and seeds of Arabidopsis, and has shown that the content of leaf and seed glucosinolates varies extensively across the different ecotypes [16,17], providing a powerful tool for QTL mapping [18].

Detailed studies on glucosinolate composition and distribution among organs throughout plant development have been performed with the ecotype Columbia [15,19]. This ecotype contains 28 different glucosinolates derived from chain-elongated methionine derivatives, homophenylalanine, tryptophan [15,17,20] and phenylalanine (P. Brown and J. Gershenzon, pers. commun.). The predominant compounds are 4-methylthio- and 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate in seeds and rosette leaves, respectively, and indol-3-ylmethylglucosinolate in the roots [19].

Glucosinolate structure and diversity

To date, more than 120 different glucosinolates have been detected in hundreds of plant species of the order Capparales and in the genus Drypetes (Euphorbiales) [14]. All glucosinolates have a common core structure comprising a β-D-thioglucose group linked to a sulfonated aldoxime moiety and a variable side chain derived from amino acids (Fig. 1). Generally, they are grouped into aliphatic, aromatic and indole glucosinolates depending on whether they originate from aliphatic amino acids (methionine, alanine, valine, leucine, isoleucine), aromatic amino acids (tyrosine, phenylalanine) or tryptophan. The structural diversity of glucosinolates is due to chain elongations of protein amino acids before the formation of the glucosinolate core structure and secondary modifications of the glucosinolate side chain (e.g. thiol oxidation, desaturation, hydroxylation, esterification) and/or the glucose moiety (esterification).

Glucosinolate biosynthesis

The biosynthesis of glucosinolates comprises three independent stages. First, some amino acids, such as methionine and phenylalanine, are elongated by one or several methylene groups. Second, the precursor amino acids are converted to the parent glucosinolates, and, finally, the parent glucosinolates can undergo secondary modifications. The sequence of these stages has been suggested based on in vivo studies [21]. The identification of Arabidopsis genes involved in biosynthetic steps of all three stages and the characterization of the corresponding enzymes have confirmed this concept.

Fig. 3. Biosynthesis of the glucosinolate core structure. In two consecutive cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase-catalysed steps (a, b), the amino acid is converted via an aldoxime to a reactive intermediate that is then conjugated with a sulfur donor (presumably cysteine) (c). The reactive intermediate is proposed to be an aci-nitro compound or a nitrile oxide. The thiohydroximic acid released from the S-alkylthiohydroximate by a C-S lyase (d) is glucosylated (e) and sulfated (f). Structural changes resulting from the individual reactions are highlighted in red. Abbreviations: cytP450, cytochrome P450-dependent mono-oxygenase; PAPS, 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate; R, variable side chain; UDPG, uridine diphosphate glucose.

Chain-elongated methionine derivatives

The chain-elongation pathway (Fig. 2), first suggested in the 1960s [22], has recently been confirmed by feeding experiments in *Eruca sativa* [23] and *Arabidopsis* [21]. The pathway is initiated by transamination of methionine to form the corresponding 2-oxo acid. Similar to the biosynthesis of leucine, the 2-oxo acid is then extended by one methylene group by a three-step cycle consisting of a condensation with acetyl-CoA, an isomerization and an oxidative decarboxylation [23]. The newly formed 2-oxo acid can be transaminated to the corresponding methionine derivative or can undergo further cycles of chain elongation.

Complementing genetic work in *Brassica* cultivars and *Arabidopsis* has resulted in the identification of the *Gsl-elong* locus, which controls methionine side-chain elongation [24, 25]. QTL mapping and fine-scale mapping of this locus in *Arabidopsis* using RI lines derived from a cross of the ecotypes Landsberg erecta (rich in homomethionine-derived glucosinolates with a basic side chain of three methylene groups) and Columbia (rich in dihomomethionine-derived glucosinolates with a basic side chain of four methylene groups) identified two genes encoding proteins of an isopropylmalate-synthase-like family in the region

tryptophan to indole-3-acetaldoxime [33, 35], and CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 metabolize chain-elongated methionine derivatives (S.Chen et al., unpublished) [34, 36]. CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 differ in their substrate specificity. CYP79F1 knockout mutants are free of glucosinolates derived from short-chain methionine homologues (with one to four additional methylene groups) but contain wild-type levels of pentahomo- and hexahomomethionine-derived glucosinolates. Characterization of these mutants suggested that CYP79F1 only converts short-chain methionine derivatives to the corresponding aldoximes [36]. However, recent investigations have shown that CYP79F1 is actually able to metabolize not only short-chain methionine homologues but also pentahomo- and hexahomomethionine, whereas the catalytic activity of CYP79F2 is restricted to pentahomo- and hexahomomethionine (S.Chen et al., unpublished). How the metabolism of chain-elongated methionine derivatives by CYP79F1 and CYP79F2 is regulated in relation to the chain-elongation pathway is an interesting question. In summary, evidence has been provided that CYP79 homologues are involved in aldoxime formation in the biosynthesis of all three structural classes of glucosinolates.

Identification of the CYP79 homologues has provided important tools for metabolic engineering of glucosinolate profiles. Overexpression, downregulation and knockout mutation of endogenous CYP79 homologues, and the overexpression of exogenous CYP79 homologues from cyanogenic plants, result in dramatically changed levels of the corresponding glucosinolates and open the possibility of generating custom-designed glucosinolate profiles [37]. For example, overexpression in Arabidopsis of CYP79A1 from the cyanogenic Sorghum bicolor results in the accumulation of large amounts of p-hydroxybenzylglucosinolate, which is not present in the wild-type plant [38].

CYP79 homologues that metabolize the same substrate might be regulated differently, as indicated by studies with CYP79B2 and CYP79B3. CYP79B2 is induced by wounding [33] and infection with a virulent strain of Pseudomonas syringae [35], whereas CYP79B3 (but not CYP79B2) is induced by treatment with jasmonic acid and the cultural filtrate of the nonspecific pathogen Erwinia carotovora [5]. This, together with increased levels of indole glucosinolates in the treated plants and growth inhibition of E. carotovora by breakdown products of indole glucosinolates, suggests that indole glucosinolates can play a role in plant defence against this pathogen (and perhaps others) [5].

Two members of another cytochrome P450 family (CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 from Arabidopsis) have been identified as the aldoxime-metabolizing enzymes involved in the next step of the biosynthesis (the oxidation of the aldoximes and conjugation with a sulfur donor) by two different approaches:

Fig. 4. Cytochrome-P450-dependent mono-oxygenases involved in the biosynthesis of the glucosinolate core structure. Characterization of the substrate-specificity of cytochrome-P450-dependent mono-oxygenases of the CYP79 and CYP83 families has almost completely elucidated the first two steps in the biosynthesis of the core structure. Only the homophenylalanine-metabolizing enzyme has not yet been identified, and the members of the CYP79C subfamily have not yet been assigned a function. In CYP83B1 knockout mutants only, aromatic aldoximes and indole-3-acetaldoxime are metabolized by CYP83A1. Abbreviation: trp-der, tryptophan-derived.

and the ratio of glucosinolates synthesized from methionine derivatives with seven and eight methylene groups has been discussed previously [16, 18]. If there is a second pathway for chain elongation of methionine, how does the plant keep it separated from the pathway for the short-chain methionine derivatives?

Glucosinolate core structure Most intermediates in the biosynthetic pathway of the glucosinolate core structure are known (Fig. 3). In vivo biosynthetic studies have shown that N-hydroxy amino acids, aldoximes, thiohydroximic acids and desulfo glucosinolates are precursors of glucosinolates. The enzymes catalysing the conversion of amino acids to aldoximes have only recently been identified by several independent approaches using Arabidopsis as a model plant. From these studies, it has become evident that cytochrome-P450-dependent mono-oxygenases (cytochromes P450) catalyse the conversion of amino acids to aldoximes in the biosynthesis of glucosinolates, as indicated by previous biochemical investigations [29, 30]. A functional genomics approach was based on the similarity of the glucosinolate biosynthetic pathway to the biosynthetic pathway of cyanogenic glucosides, another group of amino-acid-derived natural plant products. In the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, cytochromes P450 of the CYP79 family catalyse the conversion of the amino acids to the aldoximes [31]. Homologues of these cytochromes P450 were identified in the Arabidopsis genome, and the heterologously produced proteins were characterized for their substrate specificity [32–34]. A screen of an Arabidopsis cDNA library for cDNAs conferring resistance to 5-fluoroindole (the precursor of a toxic tryptophan derivative in yeast) led to the isolation of a CYP79 homologue that catalyses indole-3-acetaldoxime formation [35]. A mutant with a bushy phenotype was shown to be a knockout mutant of a CYP79 homologue [36].

To date, five of the seven functional CYP79 homologues found in the Arabidopsis genome have been characterized and shown to be involved in glucosinolate biosynthesis [37] (Fig. 4). The substrate of CYP79A2 is phenylalanine [32], CYP79B2 and CYP79B3 convert

Examples of aliphatic glucosinolates with modified side chain and their hydrolysis products. 4-Methylsulfinylbutyl-glucosinolate (a) can be modified into 3-butenylglucosinolate (b), 2-hydroxy-3-butenyl-glucosinolate (c) or 4-hydroxybutyl-glucosinolate (d), and genetic loci controlling the modifications have been identified in *Brassica* cultivars and *Arabidopsis*. Depending on the structure of the side chain and other factors, hydrolysis products with different physicochemical and biological properties are formed [49–51].

a systematic reverse-genetics approach, combined with a screen for auxin phenotypes [39, 40], and a biochemical approach [41]. CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 share 63% amino acid identity and are closely related to the aldoxime-metabolizing CYP71E1, which is involved in the biosynthesis of the cyanogenic glucoside dhurrin [42]. CYP83B1 oxidizes aldoximes to reactive compounds, possibly aci-nitro compounds or nitrile oxides, which react with nucleophilic sulfur donors, probably cysteine, to form S-alkylthiohydroximates, the next identified intermediates in the pathway [39, 41].

Biochemical characterization of recombinant CYP83A1 and CYP83B1 shows that both enzymes can metabolize all the aldoximes tested. However, CYP83A1 has high affinity for the aliphatic aldoximes, whereas CYP83B1 has high affinity for indole-3-acetaldoxime and the aromatic aldoximes (P. Naur et al., unpublished) [40] (Fig. 4).

The S-alkylthiohydroximates are converted to the thiohydroximic acids in a reaction thought to be catalysed by a C-S lyase. The S-glucosyltransferase and the sulfotransferase, which catalyse the last two steps in the pathway, have been purified and shown to be nonspecific with respect to the side chain [1].

Indole-3-acetaldoxime is thought to be an intermediate of auxin biosynthesis, and CYP83B1 knockout mutants have an increased auxin phenotype. Based on these observations, it has been proposed that CYP83B1 functions as a regulator of auxin biosynthesis [39, 43]. Possible evolutionary relationships between the biosynthetic pathways of cyanogenic glucosides, glucosinolates and auxin have been discussed [39, 41]. If glucosinolate biosynthesis evolved from the biosynthesis of cyanogenic glucosides, a scenario can be envisioned in which a mutation of the aldoxime-metabolizing cytochrome P450 of the cyanogenic glucoside pathway led to the production of oxidized aldoximes, which were toxic to the plant. These might then have been detoxified into glucosinolates by conjugation with cysteine, glycosylation and sulfation, which are general detoxification reactions in plants [41].

Secondary modifications Modifications of the glucosinolate side chain are of particular importance because the physicochemical properties and the biological activity of the glucosinolate degradation products are to a large extent determined by the structure of the side chain (Fig. 5). Methionine-derived glucosinolates are most extensively modified. Genetic loci that control these modifications have been mapped in *Brassica* cultivars and *Arabidopsis* [25, 44–46], and the first enzymes involved in side-chain modifications have recently been identified [47].

Based on genetic studies, a model for the side-chain modification of aliphatic glucosinolates has been proposed [46]. According to this model, the Gsl-oxid locus controls the oxidation of methylthio-to methylsulfinylalkylglucosinolates (for glucosinolates with a basic side chain of three and four carbon atoms), the Gsl-alk locus controls the removal of the

methylsulfinyl residue and the introduction of a
double bond (for glucosinolates with a basic side
chain of three and four carbon atoms), and the Gsl-oh
locus is responsible for the hydroxylation of
butenylglucosinolate (Fig. 5). In Arabidopsis, an
additional locus termed Gsl-ohp controls the conversion
of methylsulfinylpropyl-to hydroxypropylglucosinolate
[25,45]. Fine-scale mapping of the closely linked loci
Gsl-alk and Gsl-ohp (also referred to jointly as
GS-AOP) using Arabidopsis RI lines derived from
Columbia–Landsberg erecta and Landsberg
erecta–Cape Verde Island crosses identified three
candidate genes, AOP1, AOP2 and AOP3, which all
encode 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenases
[47,48]. Of these, AOP2 is expressed only in the
Cape Verde Island ecotype, which accumulates
alkenylglucosinolates, whereas AOP3 is expressed only
in the Landsberg erecta ecotype, which accumulates
hydroxypropylglucosinolate [47]. Heterologous
expression of the genes in E. coli showed that AOP2
catalyses the conversion of 3-methylsulfinylpropyl-
and 4-methylsulfinylbutylglucosinolate to the
corresponding alkenylglucosinolates (the ‘alk’ reaction),
and that AOP3 can convert 3-methylsulfinylpropyl-to
3-hydroxypropylglucosinolate (the ‘ohp’ reaction) [47].
AOP1 is thought to be the ancestral gene from which
AOP2 and AOP3 derived by two gene-duplication
events [47]. However, the function of AOP1 remains
to be identified.

Conclusions
During the past few years, research on glucosinolate
biosynthesis has profited enormously from the
development of molecular and genetic tools for gene
identification in Arabidopsis. The availability of the
Arabidopsis genome sequence has enabled functional
genomics approaches and greatly facilitated QTL
mapping to identify genes involved in glucosinolate
biosynthesis. In addition, reverse genetics and
mutant screens have contributed to the recent
advances in the field. In evolutionary terms, the
biosynthesis of glucosinolates might provide
examples of the recruitment of enzymes of primary
metabolism for the synthesis of secondary
metabolites (MAM1), the biosynthesis of new
secondary compounds by mutation of genes involved
in the biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites
(CYP83s) and the generation of diversity by gene
duplication (AOPs, CYP79s). Future research will
focus on the regulation of glucosinolate biosynthesis
in response to signalling molecules, turnover and
translocation of glucosinolates in the plant, and the
role of glucosinolates in plant–insect and
plant–pathogen interactions. With the identification
of genes involved in several different steps of
glucosinolate biosynthesis, the improvement of
nutritional quality and pest resistance of crop plants
by genetic engineering of glucosinolate profiles is now
a realistic possibility.

# Pollination failure in plants: why it happens and when it matters

## Chris Wilcock and Ruth Neiland

Pollination is the primary step in seed formation. Pollination biologists have shown that pollination failure can occur at all steps in the dispersal process and at several different levels. Increased risk of pollination failure is associated with pollen if it is delivered to a stigma too little, too much, too late, too mixed in composition or too poor in quality. It is associated with pollinators when they are too few or too inconsistent, and with plants when they are too specialized or too selective. It is associated with populations when they are too sparse, too small in number or too uniform genetically, and with communities when they are too fragmented, genetically impoverished or under rapid modification. Understanding the causes of pollination failure in plants can aid the successful conservation and recovery of rare plants, maintenance of crop yields, and sustainable use of wild plant resources such as forest timber.

Published online: 15 May 2002

The release, transport and deposition of pollen from the male part of a flower to a stigma constitutes the process of pollination. It has often been assumed that during this process stigmas commonly receive sufficient pollen to fertilize all available ovules and that any failure in fruit or seed production occurs because of a lack of resources. However, it is clear from recent reviews [1,2] that the majority of plants, at least at times, exhibit pollination failure. Natural levels of pollination failure vary even between closely related species and, for the same species, between different sites and years [1], suggesting that the pollination environment is highly variable.

The existence of pollination failure can be shown by supplementation experiments where increased fruit and seed set results from the addition of pollen, or pollinators, although care must be taken in their design and interpretation [3]. These experiments, together with field studies, are beginning to uncover widespread pollination failure in plants and to identify some of the factors causing failure.
