The Ras superfamily of small G proteins is remarkable for both its diversity and physiological functions. One member, Rap1, has been implicated in a particularly wide range of biological processes, from cell proliferation and differentiation to cell adhesion. But the diversity of Rap1 has led to contradictory reports of its effects. Originally identified as an antagonist of Ras-induced transformation, Rap1 can oppose other actions of Ras including regulation of cell growth and differentiation, integrin-dependent responses and synaptic plasticity. Furthermore, recent evidence confirms that Rap1, like Ras, can activate the MAP kinase cascade (ERK) in several cell types. These diverse functions of Rap1 underscore that the activation and action of Rap1 are regulated by complex factors that are cell-type specific.

Rap1 is a member of the Ras family of small G proteins, which plays a central role in cell biology by coupling signals generated within biological membranes to intracellular effectors. The Ras family includes Ras (Ha-Ras, K-Ras and N-Ras), R-Ras, M-Ras, Rap1, Rap2, TC21, Ral and Rheb [1]. Ras and Rap1 share extensive homology within the regions involved in effector binding, and both bind to the effectors Raf-1, B-Raf, RalGDS and AF-6 [2]. However, the utilization of effectors is not only dictated by their ability to bind Ras or Rap1 but also by where that binding occurs. All small G proteins are linked to biological membranes via lipid modifications; they activate effectors (Box 1) by linking them to potential substrates, activators or both. Rap1 localization is remarkably diverse and can localize to Golgi [2,3], lysosomal vesicles [2], perinuclear structures [4], endosomes [3,5,6] and the plasma membrane [7,8].

One example of intracellular targeting that dictates Rap1 function comes from examining the ability of Rap1 to regulate Raf-1 (Fig. 1). Rap1 (originally called K-rev for Ki-Ras revertant) was first identified as an antagonist of Ras, in part, by blocking Ras activation of Raf-1 [2,3]. Importantly, Rap1 can bind to Raf-1 with high affinity but cannot activate it [2,3]. This is largely because Rap1, unlike Ras, recruits Raf-1 to membrane domains that do not allow the Raf-1 phosphorylations that are necessary for full activity [9]. How subcellular localization influences both the opportunity and the consequence of effector binding for other effectors of Rap1 remains unknown.

Rap1 is involved in two important signaling pathways:

activating integrins and regulating the MAP kinase (ERK) cascade. The relationship between Rap1 and MAP kinases (ERKs) is somewhat controversial. Recent reports and reviews suggest that Rap1 does not regulate ERKs [3,10,11]; yet there are also a wide range of reports that demonstrate that Rap1 can regulate ERKs (see Tables 1 and 2, and Refs therein) as well as other proteins. Therefore, the multitude of known

### Box 1. Proposed effectors of Rap1

Rap1 both activates and inhibits several proteins in a GTP-dependent manner (Fig. 1). Activation of B-Raf occurs by direct binding to GTP-loaded Rap1, whereas the mechanism of enhancement of integrin signaling by Rap1 is not known. Inhibition of protein function by Rap1 might be through binding and sequestration, as proposed for Raf-1 [2] and Ral-GDS, or might be indirect. Recent studies identify several new effectors of Rap1, including phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K), p38, phospholipase Cε (PLCε) and AF-6. Rap1 regulation of PI3-K/Akt might be important for the mitogenic and differentiating effects of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [42,79]. In thyroid cells, Rap1 has been reported to activate as well as inhibit PI3-K and its downstream target Akt. [42,79]. Rap1 activation following cell stretching activates p38 [80]. Rap1 activation of p38 is required for the retrieval of post-synaptic AMPA receptors during long-term depression [58]. By contrast, Rap1 inhibits p38 activation induced by interleukin-1 and Ras [77]. PLCε, a novel isoform of PLC, can be activated by both Ras and Rap1 [28]. Interestingly, PLCε can activate Rap1 directly [28], and, therefore, amplify signals through Rap1 [28,29]. AF-6 associates with Rap1 in a GTP-dependent manner and with profilin, possibly coupling Rap1 to cortical actin assembly [11]. In Drosophila, AF-6 is required for maintaining the integrity of ectodermal epithelium, perhaps through its interaction with ZO-1 [11].

physiological actions of Rap1 raises an important question in cell signaling—how can the cell coordinate the diverse actions of Rap1 into a coherent physiological response? For some responses, the choice of effector pathways is dictated by cell-type-specific expression of effectors, but for other responses, the mode of Rap1 activation might dictate the outcome of that activation. For this reason, much attention has focused on the emerging family of Rap1 exchangers—guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs)—whose distinct intracellular locales might both activate Rap1 and direct Rap1 to specific targets.

### Rap1 activation

Rap1, like all G proteins, binds GDP in its inactive state and GTP in its active state. Rap1-GDP is activated by specific GEFs that displace bound GDP, replacing it with more abundant intracellular GTP. Studies have identified numerous GEFs that can activate Rap1, including C3G, cAMP-GEFs, CalDAG-GEFs, and PDZ-GEFs, whose subcellular locales might direct the activation of specific subcellular pools of Rap1 [1,2] (Fig. 2).

### C3G

With the single exception of SmgGDS, a non-specific GEF [1], all Rap1 GEFs contain a GEF domain that is homologous to CDC25. One of these—C3G—exists as a complex with the adaptor protein Crk, and can activate Rap1, Rap2, and selected Rho family GTPases [1]. To activate Rap1, the Crk-C3G complex is brought to the membrane via interactions between the Crk SH2 domain and tyrosine residues on growth-factor receptors or accessory docking proteins [2,6,12,13].

**Fig. 1. Opposing actions of Ras and Rap1. Many of the actions of Rap1 are contrary to the known action of Ras. For example, Rap1 opposes Ras inhibition of integrin signaling [73]. Rap1 antagonizes Ras activation of Raf-1 [2,9], Ral-GDS, and p38 [77], although Rap1 might also activate p38 in selected cells. Recent studies demonstrate that Rap1 and Ras have opposing actions on AMPA receptor (AMPA) trafficking as well. Activity-dependent delivery of AMPARs containing long cytoplasmic tails into post-synaptic hippocampal membranes requires Ras, whereas the retrieval of AMPARs containing short cytoplasmic tails requires Rap1 [58]. In addition, antagonism of Ras signaling might occur by transcription of antagonists of Ras signaling, such as TGF-β receptor II [78].**

*Examples of cell types and stimuli for which Rap1 activation has been shown to inhibit Ras-dependent ERK activation. The stimuli that were used to activate Rap1 and Ras are indicated. The requirement of Rap1 was established by inhibiting the activation of Rap1 by RapN17 or Rap1GAP, or by inhibiting Crk/C3G [66]. Abbreviations: CHO, Chinese hamster ovary; EGF, epidermal growth factor; PDGF, platelet-derived growth factor; PTH, parathyroid hormone; TCR, T cell receptor.

Cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases can also phosphorylate specific proteins to act as scaffolds for Crk-C3G activation of Rap1. Src substrates that can serve this function are Cas and its homolog Sin [2, 14, 15]. Cas also facilitates Rap1 activation via a novel Rap1-GEF, AND-34 [1]. Another candidate scaffolding molecule that is phosphorylated by Src is Cbl, which binds Crk-C3G upon tyrosine phosphorylation to activate Rap1 [2, 3]. The cAMP-dependent protein kinase, PKA, also triggers Cbl-Crk-C3G activation of Rap1 via Src [16].

cAMP-GEFs

cAMP can also activate Rap1 in a PKA-independent manner via cAMP-binding proteins that contain Rap1-GEF domains. These proteins, called Epacs (exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP) [17] and cAMP-GEFs [18], are selective activators of Rap1 and Rap2, and exist as at least two isoforms. cAMP-GEFI is widely expressed whereas cAMP-GEFII is expressed in brain, pituitary, adrenal and liver [2, 18]. Both are targeted to membranes via DEP domains (found in dishevelled, Egl-10 and pleckstrin). They contain one (cAMP-GEFI) or two (cAMP-GEFII) cyclic nucleotide-binding domains (CNBDs) whose inhibition of GEF activity is released upon nucleotide binding [2]. The affinity of CNBDs for cAMP is lower than that of the PKA regulatory subunits [19], perhaps restricting the activation of cAMP-GEF to subcellular region with high cAMP levels. Direct studies using antisense and interfering mutants of cAMP-GEFs implicate cAMP-GEFII in cAMP-mediated exocytosis [2]. Specific pharmacological tools that appear selective for GEFs [10] have identified potential roles for these GEFs in calcium-mediated calcium release [20] and cell adhesion [21]. Microinjection of cAMP-GEF antibodies have demonstrated cAMP-GEF coupling to Rap1, B-Raf and ERKs [22].

cAMP-GEFs are found within perinuclear regions, the nuclear membrane and mitochondria [23], and their subcellular localization appears to be tightly regulated during the cell cycle [23]. cAMP-GEF might activate select pools of Rap1, as proposed for other RapGEFs [7]. The recent identification of the cAMP analog, 8-CPT (MeO)-cAMP, which preferentially activates cAMP-GEFs, might help to identify unexpected roles for this class of molecule [10]. Future studies will determine whether the ability of these exchangers to regulate ERK signaling is limited by subcellular compartmentalization, cell-type-specific factors, or both.


**Figure 2. Rap1 exchange factors (GEFs). Rap1 is activated by GEFs that stimulate the exchange of bound GDP for GTP, through CDC25 homology domains [1]. C3G is constitutively bound to Crk proteins through a proline-rich domain (PRD) that binds to the Crk SH3 domain. The SH2 domain of Crk links the complex to tyrosine phosphorylations occurring on membrane receptors and adaptor proteins. PDZ-GEFs are recruited to PDZ-binding sites present on membrane receptors and proteins. CalDAG-GEFs are regulated by calcium and diacyl glycerol (DAG) via EF-hand-binding sites (EF) and C1-binding sites, respectively, and can be activated by the products of phospholipase C (PLC). cAMP-GEFs can be activated by cAMP binding to one or two cyclic nucleotide binding domains (CNBDs), and are localized to membranes via DEP (found in dishevelled, Egl-10, and pleckstrin) domains. PLCε can also activate Rap1 via activation by Ras or Rap1.**

Ca²⁺ and/or DAG-activated GEFs

CalDAG-GEFs are regulated by calcium, diacyl glycerol (DAG), or both, via distinct calcium and DAG-binding domains [1,24]. CalDAG-GEFI and CalDAG-GEFII are both highly expressed in hematopoietic cells. The activation of Rap1 by CalDAG-GEFI, and its longer splice form RasGRP 2, is enhanced by calcium and DAG [1,24,25]. CalDAG-GEFII (RasGRP1) appears to be selective for Ras, whereas CalDAG-GEFIII (RasGRP3) activates Ras, R-Ras and Rap1 [26]. The coordinate activation of Ras and Rap1 by CalDAG-GEFIII and other GEFs [1,27] might function *in situ*, in which Rap1 limits Ras-mediated signals.

PDZ-GEFs

PDZ-GEFs might regulate both activation and subcellular localization of Rap1. PDZ-GEF1 (RA-GEF1, nRapGEP and CNRasGEF) is largely expressed within neuronal cells [26] and shows specificity toward Rap1 and Rap2 [4,26]. PDZ-GEF1 contains both a PSD-95/DlgA/ZO-1 (PDZ) domain, which regulates attachment to the plasma membrane, and an atypical CNBD [1]. PDZ-GEF1 also contains a Ras-associating or Ral-GDS/AF6 homology (RA) domain, which specifically interacts with Rap1A [4] and Rap2B [26], and enhances Rap1 activation of B-Raf [4]. This domain might also contribute to activation of Rap1 at specific subcellular locations within the perinuclear region [4]. Two related, but distinct, Rap1-GEFs – PDZ-GEF2 (RA-GEF2) and MR-GEF – both contain Ras-associating domains that specifically bind M-Ras (R-Ras3) at the plasma membrane where they can regulate discrete pools of Rap1 [7]. The number of Rap1 exchangers and their diversity have given rise to conflicting reports regarding the consequences of Rap1 activation [10]. It is unclear why there are so many Rap1 exchangers [1] and it is not known whether their distinct locations influence Rap1 function.

One isoform of phospholipase C (PLC), PLCε, contains a CDC25 homology domain that can activate Rap1. PLCε can be activated by Ras and Rap1 [28], suggesting that PLCε–Rap1 might be part of a positive feedback loop extending Rap1 activation [28,29]. Interestingly, ectopic expression of PLCε [28], C3G, MR-GEF and PDZ-GEF1 [26,30], but not cAMP-GEF [10], regulates ERK signaling pathways. These studies suggest that certain Rap1-GEFs activate pools of Rap1 that couple to distinct intracellular effectors.

Rap1 regulation of the ERK cascade

One of the unique features of Rap1 is its cell-type-specific regulation of ERK, which is dictated by the cell-type-specific expression of the MAP kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK) B-Raf.

Rap1 activation of ERKs: the role of B-Raf

Initial studies examining Rap1 focused on its ability to antagonize Ras. However, Rap1 can also activate the related Raf isoform B-Raf to activate ERKs [31]. Recent studies show that Drosophila Raf (dRaf) can be activated by Drosophila Rap1 to activate ERK [32], demonstrating that a Rap1–Raf–ERK module is evolutionarily conserved. Interestingly, mammalian B-Raf shares sequence similarities with dRaf, but not Raf-1, that dictate the activation of B-Raf by Rap1 [9].

Two cell types, neuronal cells and megakaryocytes, highlight the ability of Rap1 to induce sustained activation of ERKs via B-Raf. In one model using neuronal PC12 cells, the sustained activation of ERKs is required for neuronal differentiation induced by nerve growth factor (NGF). In these cells, Rap1 can be activated by NGF [5,6,12], thus, increasing the duration of ERK signaling and potentiating neuronal differentiation through Rap1 activation of B-Raf [12,30]. In megakaryocytes, the sustained activation of Rap1, B-Raf and ERKs by thrombopoietin induces megakaryocytic differentiation [29]. Moreover, megakaryocytic differentiation and sustained ERK activation can be inhibited by contact with stromal cells, which blocks sustained Rap1 activation [33].

The selectivity activation Rap1–B-Raf–ERK is dictated by upstream protein complexes that trigger the mode of Rap1 activation. For example, Src activation of Rap1–B-Raf–ERK can occur through activation of Src by PKA or through association of Src with Cas (or the related molecule Sin). Both mechanisms trigger the assembly of a complex of Crk and C3G to activate Rap1, B-Raf and ERK [14,16]. But Src activation by other stimuli activates ERKs via Ras [14,16]. These data demonstrate that specific scaffold modules can channel certain stimuli towards Rap1 activation.

G protein-coupled receptors activate Rap1/B-Raf

cAMP was the first G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR)-coupled signaling molecule shown to activate Rap1 [34], and the activation of ERKs by cAMP via Rap1 was subsequently shown [31,35]. Many hormones and agonists that elevate intracellular cAMP levels activate Rap1, including isoproterenol [16,36], adenosine [37], dopamine [38], corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) [39], melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH) [2], Thromboxane A₂ [40], parathyroid hormone (PTH) [41], thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) [42] and calcitonin [22] and others. In many of these studies, cAMP-activated ERKs, Rap1 was shown to be required for this effect, as demonstrated by the ability of the interfering mutant of Rap1 (RapN17) or the Rap1 inactivator Rap1GAP to block ERK activation [16,22,35,38–40,43–46]. However, studies that exclusively rely of RapN17 must be interpreted with caution because RapN17, like RasN17, might function by sequestering upstream GEFs, some of which might also activate other G proteins. Studies demonstrating the requirement of Rap1 in ERK activation are outlined in Table 1; all of the cells examined in these studies express B-Raf. Moreover, in many of these studies a role of B-Raf in Rap1 activation of ERKs was suggested by showing either a direct association between Rap1 and B-Raf or activation of B-Raf by Rap1. However, these do not always indicate functional coupling to ERKs.

Activation of Rap1–B-Raf–ERKs by cAMP has been shown to be both PKA-dependent [16,31,35,37,39,40,44] and PKA-independent [41,46]. PKA-independent activation suggests the possible involvement of cAMP-GEF. Direct confirmation of a cAMP-GEFI–Rap1–B-Raf–ERK pathway in native kidney cells has been recently

demonstrated using neutralizing antibodies to these
proteins [22].

cAMP can also activate ERKs independently of Rap1, through Ras, despite Rap1 activation and coupling to B-Raf [36, 37, 47–49]. The mechanisms that enable cAMP to activate Ras are unknown, although both PKA-dependent [36] and PKA-independent pathways have been proposed [42, 48]. In addition, in the specific case of stimulation of ERKs by isoproterenol via the β2 adrenergic receptor, the direct PKA phosphorylation of the β2 receptor activates Ras via a switch from Gsα to Giβγ signaling [50]. The ability of Rap1 to couple ERKs upon activation by certain stimuli, but not others—even within the same cell [10, 36]—suggests that certain stimuli might activate distinct pools of Rap1 that couple to distinct effectors.

ERK activation through Gq-coupled GPCRs might also require Rap and B-Raf [51], via PLC [52, 53], suggesting a possible role for CalDAG-GEFs. Indeed, a complex between CalDAG-GEF1, Rap1 and B-Raf was induced by the Gq-coupled agonist, carbachol [53]. Moreover, antisense reduction of CalDAG-GEF1 mRNA inhibited both the formation of this complex and ERK activation [53], demonstrating that the Rap1–B-Raf–ERK module can be activated by PLC via CalDAG-GEF1.

Rap1-GAP and G proteins

Rap1 activation is terminated by a family of Rap1-specific GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The Gαo and Gαi subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins associate with Rap1-GAP and have been suggested to regulate ERK signaling both by sequestering Rap1-GAP away from Rap1 and by recruiting Rap1-GAP to activated Rap1 [2, 54]. Activated α subunits of Gz also bind and activate Rap1-GAP, forming a tertiary complex among Gz, Rap1-GAP and Rap1, which attenuates activation of Rap1–B-Raf–ERK by NGF to limit differentiation of PC12 cells [55]. Recent studies have identified a novel function of Rap1-GAP proteins, to regulate the spatial distribution of Rap1 activation [8].

B-Raf isoforms

B-Raf expression might act as a developmental or pathophysiological switch, regulating ERK-dependent proliferation and differentiation in a variety of cells. B-Raf has two major splice forms, encoding a 95 kDa and a 62–65 kDa protein, and the pattern of these splice forms might dictate the outcome of Rap1 signaling to ERKs [37, 41]. It is intriguing to speculate that these isoforms are regulated by Rap1 in different manners, although this has not been directly examined. Both the ectopic expression of B-Raf in astrocytes and the developmental expression of B-Raf in bone cells convert cAMP–Rap1 signals from inhibitors into activators of ERKs and proliferation [41, 56]. Moreover, elevated expression of Rap1b and B-Raf potentiates signaling to ERKs in animal models of diabetic nephropathy [57].

Regulation of Rap–B-Raf action

Although B-Raf activation by Rap1 is associated with ERK signaling, the expression of B-Raf and Rap1 within the same cell does not ensure the coupling of Rap1 to ERKs.

Indeed, Rap1 is incapable of activating ERKs in several B-Raf-expressing cell types [2, 10, 58, 36, 47, 48], suggesting that coupling of Rap1–B-Raf–B-Raf–ERK function might be regulated by cell-type-specific proteins. One such protein is 14–3-3, whose expression is required for cAMP activation of B-Raf through Rap1 [59], and which forms a tertiary complex with Rap1 and B-Raf. Therefore, the association of additional regulatory molecules can add another layer of complexity and specificity to Rap1 signaling.

Rap1 regulation of ERKs in neurons

Rap1 appears to play a significant role in neuronal pathways. Recent studies have identified a role of Rap1 in activity-dependent changes within neuronal and PC12 cells. In PC12 cells, calcium influx triggers PKA activation of Rap1 and ERKs [60], and in striatal neurons, cAMP activates Rap1 via PKA and release of intracellular calcium [38]. However, other studies examining cAMP and calcium signaling to ERKs in cortical neurons and hippocampal cells [49] identified Ras as the mediator of these effects.

In PC12 cells, NGF triggers a program of neuronal differentiation involving the activation of a Rap1–B-Raf–ERK module [12, 30]. Activation of Rap1 by NGF requires internalization of TrkA [5] to intracellular vesicles containing Rap1, B-Raf, MEK and ERK [6]. Consistent with the idea that Rap1–B-Raf–ERK promotes neuronal differentiation, the ability of NGF to induce neurite outgrowth in PC12 cells can be attenuated by endocannabinoids through inhibition of Rap1–B-Raf–ERKs [61].

Rap1 regulation of synaptic function in neurons

A role for Rap1 in hippocampal LONG-TERM POTENTIATION (LTP; see Glossary) has been suggested from studies showing deficient LTP after Forskolin or theta frequency stimulation within hippocampi of transgenic mice expressing and interfering mutant of Rap1, RapN17 [62]. Perhaps the most exciting new development in this area identifies an unanticipated function of Rap1 in regulating

Glossary

Long-term potentiation: LTP; refers to the long-lasting (hours to days) enhancement of neuronal signaling via excitatory synapses within the cortex and hippocampus of mammalian brain following repetitive stimulation or firing of pre-synaptic neurons, and is often studied as a model for learning and memory. The best characterized forms of LTP involve the enhancement of the response to glutamate released from synaptic vesicles and require two glutamate receptor subtypes, the NMDA and AMPA glutamate receptors (classified by their preference for the glutamate agonists NMDA or AMPA, respectively) that are present on the post-synaptic cell. During high-frequency stimulation of the post-synaptic cell NMDA receptor becomes permeable to calcium. Calcium influx activates pathways that phosphorylate and redistribute AMPA receptors. Increased AMPA receptor delivery to the synapse is associated with LTP and is dependent on Ras [58].

Long-term depression: LTD; long-lasting diminution of synaptic strength that occurs following decreased synaptic activity. Often studied in synapses that can also undergo LTP, LTD has been associated with movement of AMPA receptors away from the synaptic plasma membrane. Recent studies demonstrate that this removal of AMPA receptors requires Rap1 [58].

responses and mimicked LTD, whereas interfering
mutants of Rap1 activated AMPA-receptor responses and
blocked LTD. These actions appear to reflect the Rap1-
dependent removal of specific AMPA receptors from the
post-synaptic membrane [58] (see Fig. 2). Interestingly,
this action of Rap1 was independent of ERKs, but
required p38.

The identification of Rap regulators with post-synaptic
complexes implicates Rap1 in other neuronal functions.
PDZ-GEF1, which can activate both Rap1 and Rap2 [7,26],
interacts with synaptic scaffolding molecule (S-SCAM),
which interacts with another synaptic scaffolding protein,
post-synaptic density-95 (PSD-95) and glutamate recep-
tors of the NMDA subtype [63]. Rap2, but not Rap1, has
been detected with the NMDA-receptor complex in
neurons along with spine-associated RapGAP (SPAR) –
a Rap-specific GTPase-activating protein that associates
with PSD-95, possibly to regulate dendritic spine mor-
phology [64]. These associations suggest roles of Rap1
(or Rap2) beyond ERK regulation and cellular adhesion.

Rap1 antagonism of ERKs
Rap1 does not co-localize with Ras [5,8,9]. Therefore, the
ability of Rap1 to bind Raf-1 without activating it might
sequester Raf-1 from Ras [2,65]. Activation of GEFs that
couple to Rap1 as well as Ras might provide a mechanism
to limit signals to Ras [27]. Selected examples of Rap1
antagonism of ERKs are shown in Table 2. Rap1 recruit-
ment of Raf-1 correlates with the loss of Raf-1 binding to
Ras [65]. In other studies, inhibition of Rap1 was shown to
be required for full activation of ERKs. In endothelial cells,
inhibition of Rap1 by lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is
required for LPA to activate ERKs [54]. In Chinese
hamster ovary (CHO) cells, interfering with the activation
of Rap1 by disrupting the Crk–C3G complex stimulated
ERKs [66]. Taken together, these studies suggest that the
activation of Rap1 by Crk–C3G can limit ERK activation
[66]. Recent studies examining the spatial distribution of
Rap1 activation have proposed that Rap1 antagonism of
Ras is selectively mediated by Rap1 activation at the
plasma membrane [8].

cAMP inhibition of ERKs
Rap1 activation by cAMP is one of many mechanisms that
have been proposed to participate in growth inhibition by
cAMP [67]. Recent studies demonstrate that inhibition of
ERK and proliferation by cAMP requires Rap1 through
both PKA-dependent [56,65] and PKA-independent path-
ways [41,68]. By contrast, another recent study has
reported that selective activation of cAMP-GEFs in
NIH3T3 cells expressing ectopic cAMP-GEFs, activated
Rap1 without inhibiting ERKs [10]. Although these data
apparently contradict earlier reports, they could be
explained using a model in which the activation of
Rap1 by PKA or cAMP-GEF couples with selected
subsets of Rap1. There is precedence for such a model
for PKA involving the family of A-kinase anchoring
proteins (AKAPs) and it will be important to determine

Rap1 and ERKs in T cells
A role for Rap1 in antagonizing Ras signals to ERKs
in T cells was originally proposed in the study of T-cell
anergy [2,13], which is characterized by decreased Ras-
dependent signaling to ERKs and constitutive Rap1
activation [13]. In Jurkat cells, the ectopic expression of
Rap1-GAP1 enhances activation of ERKs via the T-cell
receptor (TCR) [69], suggesting that activation of endogen-
ous Rap1 by TCR limits TCR signals to ERKs. The ability
of Rap1 to regulate ERKs in T cells is influenced by other
molecules, including the phosphotyrosine phosphatase
CD45 [70], although the mechanisms underlying this
mode of regulation are unknown.

What dictates the outcome of Rap1 activation?
Rap1 activation does not always antagonize Ras-dependent
signals even in B-Raf-negative cells [2,10,11]. Cellular
factors might influence Rap1 regulation of ERK
signaling [59]. But differences between cell types cannot
fully account for these disparities. For example, even
within the same cell, Rap1 activation by different stimuli can
either activate or not activate ERKs [10,71]. Moreover,
ectopic expression of PDZ-GEFs and C3G, but not cAMP-
GEF, have been shown to regulate ERK signaling
(Table 1). For PDZ-GEFs, C3G and possibly other
Rap1-GEFs, activation of Rap1 is limited to distinct
intracellular domains. The coupling of particular GEFs
with Rap1 might dictate the ability of Rap1 to regulate
ERKs [8,10,30]. For example, it has been proposed that
the ability of Rap1 to antagonize Ras is limited to a
pool of Rap1 that is activated at the plasma membrane
[8]. Similarly, it is likely that Rap1 activation of B-Raf-
containing endosomes [6,9]. Future studies must examine
the possibility that the activation of distinct pools of Rap1
might dictate its biochemical action.

Rap1 augmentation of integrin function
The ability of Rap1 to regulate integrin-mediated cell
adhesion and cell motility has been demonstrated in
many cell systems [3,11]. In hematopoietic cells, Rap1
is required for β integrin-mediated adhesion triggered
by erythropoietin α or interleukin-3, through C3G and
PLC [2,3]. Mouse embryo fibroblasts that are deficient
in C3G show increased cell motility, decreased integrin-
dependent cell attachment and spreading, and a
selective inhibition of Rap1 activation [3], which suggests
the involvement of C3G activation of Rap1 in these
processes.
    In platelets, Rap1 is rapidly activated by a variety of
platelet agonists [3]. For thrombin, an initial activation
of Rap1 requires calcium [11], possibly reflecting the
actions of CalDAG-GEFs. Novel pathways might also
couple signals to Rap1 and integrins. In macrophages,
β2-integrin activation by phorbol ester myristate
(PMA), tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) and lipopolysac-
charide all require Rap1 [3,11].

T-cell adhesion

Recent studies have identified a specific role for Rap1 in integrin-mediated adhesion of lymphocytes to antigen processing cells (APCs) [2,3]. Activated Rap1 stimulates T-cell adhesion in Jurkat cells [2,3] and in murine T cells expressing a RapV 12 transgene [72]. Inhibition of Rap1 blocks adhesion triggered by phorbol esters, TCR activation and CD31 [2,11]. Rap1 might also participate in positive selection during thymic development [3]. In general, these integrin effects of Rap1 seem unrelated to the antagonism of Ras and ERKs. These contradictory actions of Rap1 to enhance T-cell function through integrin adhesion and to inhibit T-cell activation through inhibition of TCR signaling could be explained if Rap1 potentiates initial integrin-dependent T cell-APC interactions [3], while interfering with TCR signaling at later time points. This need to turn off Rap1 following integrin-dependent adhesion could explain why the T cell has evolved mechanisms to inhibit Rap1 during TCR co-stimulation [69].

R-Ras as a model for Rap1 function

Because of its biochemical and structural similarities to Rap1, R-Ras offers a potential model for Rap1 function. R-Ras augments integrin signaling by reversing the inhibition induced by Ras [73]. These inhibitory actions of Ras require Raf-1, although the direct target of Ras or Raf-1 is unknown [73]. It is possible that Rap1 might also augment integrin signaling, in part, by antagonizing Ras. Indeed, in mouse embryonic fibroblasts, Rap1 could overcome the anti-adhesive effects of Ras, but not those of Raf-1 [15], paralleling studies placing Rap1 antagonism of Ras upstream of Raf-1. Interestingly, recent studies in macrophages show that the ability of R-Ras to activate the αMβ2 integrin required Rap1 [74].

Integrin regulation of Rap1 and ERKs

The actions of Rap1 to promote integrin function are enhanced by subsequent integrin activation of Rap1 itself [2,15]. This suggests that activation of Rap1 by integrin might augment integrin function through a positive feedback loop. In Swiss 3T3 cells, integrin activation of Rap1 stimulates ERKs via B-Raf [75]. By contrast, in CHO cells, ERK signaling by integrins is enhanced by inhibiting Rap1 [66], suggesting that integrin activation of Rap1 can also inhibit ERKs.

Concluding remarks

The recent interest in Rap1 underscores its involvement in a wide range of cellular processes. Its diversity, however, has contributed to the lack of consensus regarding its actions. Rap1 antagonizes Ras actions in a variety of systems (Fig. 1, Table 2), but it potentiates Ras action in others (Table 1). Rap1 activation of B-Raf and ERKs has been widely demonstrated, yet Rap1 activation of B-Raf does not lead to ERK activation in all cells. The ability of Rap1 to regulate ERKs might depend on the relative concentrations of subcellular pools of Rap1, Ras, Raf-1 and B-Raf. Rap1-GEFs — whose localization is tightly regulated — might also activate distinct subcellular pools of

Rap1, which in turn might be coupled to distinct effector pathways.

Although we have yet to develop a model for Rap1 function, certain themes are emerging. Future research must address the following questions: what are the cellular mechanisms that dictate the outcome of Rap1 signaling to ERKs? What are the effector pathways that couple Rap1 to integrin signaling? Do these pathways reflect antagonism of Ras-dependent signaling or novel effectors of Rap1 not shared by Ras? Can the apparently unrelated and often opposing actions of Rap1 on integrins and ERKs be reconciled in a unified model? Hopefully, future studies will help us to understand how Rap1 regulates such diverse processes.
