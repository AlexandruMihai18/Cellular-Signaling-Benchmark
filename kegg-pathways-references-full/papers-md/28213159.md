Signal transduction cascades in axon regeneration: insights from C. elegans

Naoki Hisamoto and Kunihiro Matsumoto

Axon regeneration after nerve injury is a conserved biological process in many animals, including humans. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans) has recently emerged as a genetically tractable model for studying regenerative responses in neurons. Extensive studies over several years using this organism have revealed a number of intrinsic and extrinsic signal transduction cascades that regulate axon regeneration, and these are found to be conserved from worms to humans. Further studies have demonstrated that these cascades consist of several signaling networks that ultimately merge into the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) cascade. In this review, we describe some recent insights into the signaling cascades controlling axon regeneration in C. elegans and describe their conserved roles in other organisms including mammals.

Shortly after injury, most axons retract their axonal terminals from the injury site. Subsequently, the proximal axons, which protrude from the cell body of the neuron, form a growth cone at the tip of the proximal axon and extend toward the target to reconstruct the nerve circuit (Figure 1) [1]. In principle, this process is conserved from invertebrates to mammals [1–3]. The molecular factors involved in this process of nervous system regeneration has classically been identified using biochemical approaches in such models as Aplysia, fish, amphibians and mammals [1,4,5]. However, the identification of novel factors involved in regeneration would be greatly facilitated by the availability of a complementary forward genetic approach. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans has recently emerged as system that provides such an approach to study regenerative responses in neurons [2]. Axon regeneration in C. elegans was first reported in 2004 [6*], enabled by the development of laser microsurgery. Similar to other animals, severed axons in C. elegans form growth cones at the ends of the proximal axon and extend their ends within several hours (Figure 1) [2]. Among the γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-releasing D-type motor neurons, which extend their axons from the ventral side to the dorsal side of the worm body, about 70% of the neurons form growth cones after axon injury. Although fewer than 10% of the severed axons can reach the dorsal side, they seem to provide some restoration of motor function of the severed neurons [6*]. Axon regeneration also occurs in other types of neurons, including sublateral touch sensory neurons and head sensory neurons [2]. Some types of regenerated neurons tend to fuse the distal segment of the severed axon in a process mediated by fusogens [7*,8]. Using this organism as a model system for axon regeneration, large-scale screening efforts have identified a number of factors involved in axon regeneration [9**,10,11*,12**,13].

Introduction  
Nerve injury in central nervous system (CNS) results in irreversible and permanent nerve dysfunction, primarily because injured CNS neurons are unable to regenerate their axons. However, axons can be regenerated in the peripheral nervous system (PNS) of mammals, and by most neurons in many other animals. The lack of regeneration in the mammalian CNS seems to be due to both the presence of factors that inhibit, and the absence of factors that enhance regeneration in other animals. Understanding the general molecular mechanisms underlying axon regeneration is essential to develop medical treatments that promote the recovery of the CNS following injury.

DLK-1–p38 MAPK cascade in axon regeneration  
Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades are evolutionally conserved in eukaryotes from yeast to humans and play key roles in many diverse physiological processes such as development, growth and proliferation, stress responses, and immunity. The MAPK cascade consists of three classes of protein kinases: MAPK, MAPK kinase (MAPKK) and MAPK kinase kinase (MAPKKK) [14]. MAPK is activated by MAPKK, which itself is activated by MAPKKK. The MAPKs are subdivided into three main groups: the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the JNK and the p38

(Left panel) After axon injury, the proximal fragment of the injured axon retracts and forms an axonal stump. The stump is transformed into a growth cone, which extends in an attempt to rebuild a synaptic connection with its target. (Right panel) The GABAergic D-type motor neurons (Green color) in *C. elegans* have cell bodies on the ventral side and extend axonal commissures dorsally where they make synaptic connections with muscles. When an axonal commissure is severed with a laser, the proximal axonal fragment initially retracts and its tip is transformed into a growth cone, which begins to extend dorsally.

kinases. The components of the MAPK signaling cascades are well conserved between *C. elegans* and mammals, and a number of signaling cascades in *C. elegans* have been reported [15–21].

Hammarlund *et al.* [9**] reported that an RNAi screen for regulators of axon regeneration identified the MAPK cascade, consisting of DLK-1 MAPKKK, MKK-4 MAPKK and PMK-3 p38 MAPK, as an essential signaling pathway involved in axon regeneration in *C. elegans* (Figure 2). Further analysis by Yan and Jin [22] revealed that calcium influx, which is triggered by axotomy [7*], is implicated in DLK-1 activation. Activated DLK-1 in turn activates PMK-3 MAPK via MKK-4 MAPKK. Activated PMK-3 then activates MAK-2, a MAPK-activated protein kinase (MAPKAPK) homolog, which stabilizes the *cebp-1* mRNA, encoding a homolog of the CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein (C/EBP) [23]. However, DLK-1 also regulates the dynamics of axonal microtubules and posttranscriptional modification of tubulin following axotomy, both of which are largely independent of CEBP-1 [24*]. Several studies have demonstrated that the *Drosophila melanogaster* and mouse homologs of DLK-1 are required for axon regeneration [25–28], suggesting that the DLK-dependent signaling cascade is important for axon regeneration across a broad range of animals. These discoveries validate the use of *C. elegans* as a model system for axon regeneration.

MLK-1–JNK MAPK cascade in axon regeneration

An RNAi screen for regulators of axon regeneration also identified another MAPKKK, MLK-1, which is a component of the JNK cascade [11*]. A follow-up study demonstrated that mutations defective in other components of the JNK cascade, MEK-1 MAPKK or KGB-1 JNK MAPK, also significantly impair axon regeneration (Figure 3). Conversely, overexpression of MLK-1 improves the frequency and timing of growth cone formation, as well as the rate of successful migration of growth cones to their target sites. These effects were also observed in older animals, whose regeneration ability is usually limited. The downstream target of JNK MAPK signaling is likely to be FOS-1, a worm homolog of the transcription factor c-Fos [29]. However, the genes that are regulated by FOS-1 in the axon regeneration response are currently unknown. Recent studies in mice have revealed that JNK is required for the efficient regeneration of axons from dorsal root ganglia (DRG) neurons *in vivo* [30]. In addition, the transcription factor c-Jun, which is a binding partner of c-Fos and is known to be a downstream target of JNK, has been shown to be important for the axonal outgrowth of neurons in axotomized rat nodose and DRG and in mouse DRG [31–33]. Similarly, both JNK and Fos are required for axon regeneration in *Drosophila* [26]. Thus, we have good evidence to say that the JNK cascade is required for axon regeneration in animals.

Role and regulation of a receptor tyrosine kinase in JNK-mediated axon regeneration

The MAPK cascade is negatively regulated by MAPK phosphatases (MKPs) [34]. A MKP in *C. elegans*, VHP-1, has been shown to act as a negative regulator of the JNK cascade [35]. In *vhp-1* null mutants, development is

arrested at the early larval stage, and this phenotype is suppressed by mutations in *mlk-1*, *mek-1* or *kgb-1*. We therefore undertook a genome-wide RNAi screen for suppressors of *vhp-1* lethality in order to identify novel genes involved in JNK-mediated signaling [12**]. The genes discovered by this screen were termed *svh* genes, for suppressors of *vhp-1* lethality. The important roles of the JNK MAPK cascade in axon regeneration raised the possibility that the *svh* genes might also function as regulators of axon regeneration.

The first gene identified by the screen for *vhp-1* suppressors was *svh-1*, which encodes an extracellular protein that belongs to the hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/plasminogen family. The second gene identified, *svh-2*, encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase, homologous to the HGF receptor Met. It was discovered that both *svh-1* and *svh-2* mutants are significantly impaired in axon regeneration. SVH-1 is constitutively expressed in a pair of sensory neurons (ADL neurons) in the head, and functions in axon regeneration in a cell non-autonomous manner. SVH-2 is normally not expressed in motor neurons, but is induced in injured motor neurons following axotomy, and acts cell-autonomously. SVH-2 physically interacts with and directly phosphorylates the tyrosine residues in MLK-1 MAPKKK

MLK-1-JNK MAPK cascade in axon regeneration.
The JNK pathway consisting of MLK-1, MEK-1 and KGB-1 positively regulates axon regeneration through the FOS-1 transcription factor. Axon injury activates the Ca²⁺-p38 MAPK and cAMP pathways (indicated by pale blue and light green, respectively) that converge through the formation of an ETS-4-CEBP-1 transcription factor complex to transactivate expression of the *svh-2* gene. SVH-2 is a tyrosine kinase receptor, which is activated by the HGF-like growth factor SVH-1. SVH-1 is constitutively expressed in, and secreted from ADL sensory neurons in the head. Activated SVH-2 phosphorylates MLK-1 MAPKKK at a tyrosine residue, creating a docking site for SHC-1. SHC-1 constitutively forms a complex with MEK-1 MAPKK, and thereby functions to connect MLK-1 and MEK-1.

(Figure 3). Phosphorylated MLK-1 then binds to SHC-1, an adaptor protein that contains phospho-tyrosine binding domains [36]. SHC-1 constitutively binds to MEK-1 MAPKK [37], and thus promotes the activation of the JNK cascade by connecting tyrosine-phosphorylated MLK-1 with MEK-1. Thus, SVH-2 activation leads to JNK MAPK signaling, which promotes the axon regeneration response [12**,36]. Consistent with this, HGF treatment in mammals promotes axon regeneration in many axotomized neurons [38–40], suggesting that the HGF-Met signaling cascade is important for axon regeneration in mammals.

Axotomy-induced expression of the *svh-2* gene is mediated by a transcription factor complex composed of ETS-4, an Ets-like transcription factor, and CEBP-1 (Figure 3) [41]. ETS-4 is phosphorylated by protein kinase A, which is activated by the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP). CEBP-1 is a downstream component of the Ca²⁺-DLK-1 cascade [22,23]. Once phosphorylated, ETS-4 forms a complex with CEBP-1 and activates the transcription of the *svh-2* gene by binding to juxtaposed

Ets- and C/EBP-binding sites in the *svh-2* promoter. Activation of both cAMP and Ca²⁺ signaling is required for the activation of *svh-2* expression [41], thus these two signaling pathways cooperatively activate the JNK cascade, which then promotes axon regeneration.

### Signaling cascades leading to MLK-1 MAPKKK Ser phosphorylation in axon regeneration

In a typical MAP kinase cascade, activation of MAPKKK is a critical control point for signal specificity and amplification. MLK-1 MAPKKK is regulated by double phosphorylation, that is SVH-2-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation, which regulates its association with SHC-1, and MAPKKK kinase (MAP4K)-mediated serine phosphorylation in the activation loop, which regulates its kinase activity (Figure 4) [36,42]. The MLK-1 Ser-355 residue is phosphorylated by both a Ste20-like kinase MAX-2 and a protein kinase C homolog TPA-1 (Figure 4). MAX-2 and TPA-1 regulate axon regeneration specifically in the L4 and adult stages, respectively [36,43]. MAX-2 is activated by the GTP-binding form of a Rac-type small GTP-binding protein (G protein) CED-10 in axon regeneration [43]. CED-10 is activated by the signaling complex CED-2–CED-5–CED-12, which acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) and binds with the integrin α subunit INA-1 via a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase SRC-1. The INA-1–CED-10 signaling cascade was previously shown to regulate the engulfment of apoptotic cells during development [44]. Thus, the conserved INA-1–CED-10 signaling unit utilized for engulfment of apoptotic cells is also used to promote axon regeneration. During cell death, phosphatidylserine is exposed at the cell surface and INA-1 can bind to the apoptotic cells [44]. A recent study has revealed that axonal injury induces the presentation of phosphatidylserine around the severed site of axotomized neurons [8]. Although factors acting upstream of INA-1–CED-10 signaling in axon regeneration are currently unknown, phosphatidylserine would be one strong candidate.

TPA-1 is activated by the lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) [45], and the production of DAG is negatively regulated by diacylglycerol kinase (DGK), which converts DAG to phosphatidic acid (PA) [46]. DGK-1 is inhibited by the GTP-bound form of RHO-1, a *C. elegans* RhoA homolog, resulting in increased DAG levels and activation of TPA-1 [47]. In axon regeneration, RHO-1 activity is regulated by Rho-GEF RHGF-1, which promotes the binding of GTP and, thus, activation

Summary of JNK MAPK cascades and the upstream signaling cascades regulating axon regeneration in *C. elegans*. In the JNK pathway, MLK-1 MAPKKK is activated by phosphorylation of Ser-355, which is catalyzed by the Ste20-related kinase MAX-2 (dark brown) and the PKC homolog TPA-1 (purple). The integrin α subunit INA-1 activates MAX-2 through the signaling complex CED-2–CED-5–CED-12 and Rac-type G protein, CED-10. The INA-1–CED-10 signaling pathway may be activated by phosphatidylserine (PS) signal. TPA-1 is activated by a signal transduction cascade involving activation of RHO-1, inhibition of DGK-1, and a consequent increase in DAG. RHO-1 is activated by the SER-7 serotonin (5-HT) receptor and by GPA-12 through RHGF-1. SER-7 is activated by 5-HT, which is ectopically synthesized in axotomized non-serotonergic neurons via HIF-1-mediated transcription of 5-HT synthesizing enzymes including * tph-1*.

of RHO-1 [48]. RHGF-1 is activated by GPA-12, a *C. elegans* homolog of the α subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein G12α. These results raise the possibility that the G12α pathway activates axon regeneration by inducing an increase in DAG, resulting in the activation of TPA, which leads to activation of the JNK pathway by phosphorylation of MLK-1 MAPKKK [48].

SER-7 is a seven transmembrane receptor for serotonin [49] and functions upstream of GPA-12 in the axon regeneration pathway [48]. A deletion mutant of the serotonin synthesis enzyme tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH-1, is defective in axon regeneration, and this defect is rescued by the addition of exogenous serotonin [48]. Serotonin is only synthesized in limited neuron types, and is not expressed in other neurons under normal conditions, including D-type motor neurons. However, in axotomized ‘non-serotonergic’ neurons, TPH-1 expression is upregulated via the hypoxia-inducible transcription factor HIF-1 [48]. Serotonin subsequently promotes axon regeneration by autocrine signaling through the SER-7 serotonin receptor. In mammals, the expression and stability of HIF-1, as well as the expression of its target genes, are all increased after spinal cord injury [50, 51]. Furthermore, HIF-induced upregulation of serotonin occurs in specific regions of the vertebrate brain [52]. Thus, the mechanisms coupling axon regeneration and serotonin signaling, leading to an alteration in neural responses is conserved among animals.

### Conclusions

Studies using *C. elegans* have revealed that axon regeneration is regulated via multiple signaling cascades that are connected to the JNK MAPK pathway (Figure 4). Other signaling cascades are also involved, including those associated with Notch [53], insulin [54], protein phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN)—target of rapamycin (TOR) [54], endocannabinoid [36], and several microRNAs [55]. Some of these latter pathways function upstream of the DLK-1–p38 and MLK-1–JNK MAPK cascades. Further studies will shed the light on the signaling machineries regulating axon regeneration.
