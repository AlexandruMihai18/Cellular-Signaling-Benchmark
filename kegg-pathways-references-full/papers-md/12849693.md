### Abstract

Silica has been known to be a factor in acute cell injury and chronic pulmonary fibrosis. In Rat2 fibroblasts, silica induced the activation of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB), which plays a crucial role in regulating the expression of many genes involved in the subsequent inflammatory response. In addition, we observed that transforming growth factor-β activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) were involved in silica-mediated NF-κB activation in Rat2 cells. The dominant negative mutant forms of TAK1 and NIK inhibited the silica-induced NF-κB activation in Rat2 cells. Furthermore, we demonstrated that endogenous TAK1 is phosphorylated in silica-stimulated Rat2 cells. These results indicate that TAK1 functions as a critical mediator in the silica-induced signaling pathway.

1. Introduction

Silica can trigger alterations in gene expression by initiating signaling events upstream of gene transactivation. These cascades are initiated at the cell surface after interaction of silica with the plasma membrane either through receptor-like mechanisms or integrins (Mossman et al., 1997). At least two signaling cascades are associated with the activation of transcription factors that are involved in modulating gene expression and DNA replication. These activations include nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade important in regulation of the transcription factor, activator protein-1 (AP-1). Both NF-κB and AP-1 bind to specific DNA sequences within the regulatory or promoter regions of genes that are critical to cell proliferation and inflammation (reviewed by Robledo and Mossman (1999)).

Specifically, NF-κB is an essential transcription factor, which controls the expression of various cytokines, chemokines, cell-adhesion molecules and growth factors (Barnes and Karin, 1997; Chen et al., 1999). Recent evidence indicates that NF-κB is stimulated by direct contact of the silica with rat lung epithelial cells and mouse peritoneal macrophage cell line (Kang et al., 2000; Ding et al., 1999). Furthermore, silica induces NF-κB activation in human bronchial epithelial cells, resulting in the induction of interleukin 8 (IL-8) production (Desaki et al., 2000). Moreover, the activation of NF-κB in situ by fibrogenic particles increases mRNA levels of inducible nitric oxide synthase, tumor necrosis factor-α, macrophage inflammatory protein-2, macrophage chemotactic protein-1, interferon-γ, IL-6 and IL-12 in lung homogenates of reporter mice after exposures to silica (Hubbard et al., 2002).

Previously, we reported that Rat2 fibroblast cells are able to generate reactive oxygen species and induce the activation of the related signal transduction pathway in response to silica (Cho et al., 1999; Seo et al., 1999). However, it is unproven whether silica and asbestos fibers stimulate NF-κB activation in fibroblasts and which molecules are involved in this stimulation. The most likely of several possible mechanisms for NF-κB activation

in fibroblasts is the IL-1 pathway via transforming growth factor-β-activated Kinase 1 (TAK1, about 65-kD) and NF-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) (Nino-miya-Tsuji et al., 1999).

In this study, we have attempted to determine whether silica could induce the activation of NF-κB in Rat2 cells, one of the rat fibroblast cell lines, although the intracellular pathway leading to the activation of NF-κB is not fully understood in fibroblast. We also examined the TAK1 and NIK signaling pathway that is important in such cellular signaling as the induction of NF-κB activation by silica. Furthermore, we demonstrated that TAK1 is activated by phosphorylation in the silica-stimulated Rat2 cells.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Plasmids

The expression plasmids of wild type TAK1, dominant negative TAK1 (TAK1K63W) and TAB1 were obtained from Dr K. Matsumoto (Nagoya University, Nagoya, Japan). The expression plasmids of wild type and dominant negative NIK were obtained from Dr T. Taniguchi (Tokyo University, Tokyo, Japan). An NF-κB-luciferase reporter plasmid, an internal control reporter, and the plasmid pRL-TK were purchased from promega.

2.2. Cell culture and reagents

Rat2 cell line was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (MEM) containing 10% heat inactivated fetal bovine serum, 100 U/ml penicillin and 100 μg/ml streptomycin. The cells were grown at 37 °C in a 5% CO₂. Dulbecco's MEM, fetal bovine serum, penicillin and streptomycin were purchased from Life Technologies, Inc. (Grand Island, NY). Silica was purchased from Sigma Chemical Co. (St. Louis, MO).

2.3. Transfection

Rat2 cells were transfected with expression plasmids using GenePORTER 2 transfection re-

agent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Gene Therapy Systems, Inc., San Diego, CA92122).

### 2.4. Luciferase assay

A confluent monolayer of Rat2 cells was trypsinized, and grown in 12-well plate ($1 \times 10^5$ cells/well). Plates were incubated at $37^\circ\text{C}$ in $5\% \mathrm{CO}_2$. After overnight incubation, cells were transiently transfected with pNF-$\kappa B$-luc and pRL-TK together with the indicated plasmids. The total amount of DNA was kept constant with pcDNA 3.1 for each transfection. After 24 h transfection, cells were exposed to silica at $37^\circ\text{C}$ for 24 h. Cells were then lysed, and their luciferase activities were measured by using the Dual-luciferase reporter system (Promega, Madison, WI). The results are expressed as relative NF-$\kappa B$ activity compared with controls.

### 2.5. Effect of the wild types of TAK1 and NIK on the silica-induced NF-$\kappa B$ activation

Rat2 cells ($1 \times 10^5$) were transfected with $0.2 \mu\text{g}$ of NF-$\kappa B$-Luc and $0.15 \mu\text{g}$ of pRL-TK-Luc in the presence or absence of wild type TAK1 and NIK expression vectors. After 24 h, the transfected cells were stimulated with or without $400 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$ silica at $37^\circ\text{C}$ for 24 h. Then the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured. Activity of the NF-$\kappa B$ reporter was normalized on the base of Renilla luciferase activity.

### 2.6. Effect of the dominant negative forms of TAK1 and NIK on the silica-induced NF-$\kappa B$ activation

Rat2 cells ($1 \times 10^5$) were transfected with $0.2 \mu\text{g}$ of NF-$\kappa B$-Luc and $0.15 \mu\text{g}$ of pRL-TK-Luc in the presence or absence of dominant negative TAK1 and NIK expression vector. After 24 h, the transfected cells were stimulated with or without $400 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$ silica at $37^\circ\text{C}$ for 24 h. Then the cells were lysed and luciferase activities were measured. Activity of the NF-$\kappa B$ reporter was normalized on the base of Renilla luciferase activity.

### 2.7. Detection of phosphorylated TAK1

Rat2 cells were incubated with or without $400 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$ silica at $37^\circ\text{C}$ for the indicated times and then lysed in buffer containing $50 \mathrm{mM} \text{Tris-HCl}$ (pH 7.4), $150 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaCl}, 1 \% \mathrm{NP}-40, 1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{EDTA}, 0.25 \% \mathrm{Na}$-deoxycholate, $1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{PMSF}, 1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{Na}_3 \mathrm{VO}_4, 1 \mathrm{mM} \mathrm{NaF}$, and $1 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$ each of aprotinin, leupeptin and pepstatin. The lysate was divided into half. One of the lysates was treated with 10 units of calf intestinal alkaline phosphatase (CIP, New England Biolab, Beverly, MA) at $37^\circ\text{C}$ for 40 min and the other was left untreated. The lysates were immunoblotted with anti-TAK1 polyclonal antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA).

### 3. Results

#### 3.1. TAK1 and NIK are required for the silica-induced NF-$\kappa B$ activation

In order to determine the optimal concentration of silica to induce NF-$\kappa B$, a dose-dependent experiment was performed. As shown in Fig. 1, within the range $100–500 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$ of silica, NF-$\kappa B$ activity was stimulated in a dose-dependent manner and reached its maximum activation at $400 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$. Therefore, we determined that $400 \mu\text{g}/\text{ml}$ silica is the optimal concentration for NF-$\kappa B$ activation, and we used this concentration for the experiment. TAK1 and NIK have been reported to mediate NF-$\kappa B$ activation triggered by lipopolysaccharide (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al., 1999; Irie et al., 2000). For this reason, we used Rat2 cells transiently transfected by cDNAs for TAK1 and NIK to analyze the TAK1 and NIK-dependent silica-signaling pathway. In mock-transfected Rat2 cells, NF-$\kappa B$ activity was slightly increased after the silica stimulation. However, Rat2 cells transfected with the wild types of TAK1 and NIK showed strong promotion of NF-$\kappa B$ activation when treated with silica (Fig. 2). NF-$\kappa B$ activity was increased 26-and 10-fold after the silica stimulation, in wild type TAK1 and NIK-transfected cells, respectively. Furthermore, we investigated whether these molecules are involved in the NF-$\kappa B$ signaling

pathway induced by silica. We analyzed the effects of expression of the mutant forms of TAK1 and NIK on the activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway by silica in Rat2 cells. Rat2 cells were cotransfected with NF-κB-luc reporter gene and plasmids expressing dominant negative mutants of TAK1 or NIK. Twenty-four hours after transfection, the transfected cells were treated with 400 μg/ml silica for 24 h. NF-κB activity was increased 2-fold in silica-treated cells compared to non-treated cells. However, silica-triggered activation of NF-κB activity was inhibited by the expression of the dominant negative mutants of NIK and TAK1 by basal level (Fig. 3). The results shown in Figs. 2 and 3 indicated that TAK1 and NIK are required for the silica-induced NF-κB activation in the Rat2 cell line.

### 3.2. TAK1 is phosphorylated upon silica stimulation

To evaluate the active status of TAK1 following silica stimulation, we observed the phosphorylation status of endogenous TAK1. Rat2 cells were stimulated with silica for the indicated times and then cell lysates were immunoblotted with anti-TAK1 antibody. Lane 1 shows the expression status of TAK1 in Rat2 cells without silica stimulation. Lanes 2, 3, and 4 show the expression status of TAK1 in Rat2 cells when they were treated (+) or untreated (-) with CIP (B). Proteins were separated on 8% SDS-PAGE gel. The pTAK1 indicates phosphorylated TAK1.

exposed to silica for 10, 30 and 60 min, respectively (Fig. 4A).

In silica-treated cells, TAK1 was phosphorylated as indicated by its slow migration pattern, demonstrating that TAK1 is activated upon silica treatment. To further confirm the phosphorylation of TAK1, we treated with CIP in cell lysates. Equal amounts of the cell lysates were treated (+) or untreated (-) with CIP. Treatment of the cell lysates with CIP abolished the mobility shift, indicating that the shift is caused by phosphorylation (Fig. 4B). Phosphorylation of TAK1 was evident at 10 min after the stimulation and continued for at least 60 min. This result indicates that TAK1 is phosphorylated upon silica treatment. In conclusion, TAK1 was activated by phosphorylation in the silica-stimulated cells; a result demonstrating that TAK1 plays an important role in the silica-mediated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

### 4. Discussion

Inhalation of silica can cause inflammatory response along the peripheral airways as well as parenchymal fibrotic lung disease. Inhaled silica particles are usually phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages that participate in the pathological process of fibrotic lung disease (Fantone et al., 1987; Sibille and Reynolds, 1990). Occasionally, silica particles can enter into the interstitium by loss of epithelial barrier. The entry of silica may allow these particles to interact with interstitial cells such as fibroblasts (Brody et al., 1985). Therefore, silica may influence the pathogenesis of silicosis upon direct contact with lung fibroblasts.

Asbestos, similar to silica, induces a dose-dependent increase in NF-κB DNA binding activity and c-myc, a gene regulated by NF-κB, expression in various cell types, such as tracheal epithelial and mesothelial cells (Janssen et al., 1995a,b, 1997). NF-κB and/or NF-IL-6-like transcription factors bind the regulatory elements of IL-8 (Simeonova and Luster, 1996), MIP-2 (Driscoll et al., 1998), and IL-6 (Simeonova et al., 1997) in alveolar type II epithelial cells. This binding is stimulated by asbestos. Furthermore, p65 immunoreactivity, which reflects the subunit responsible for the transcriptional activation potential of NF-κB, is increased in rat lungs by asbestos inhalation. Moreover, asbestos inhalation induces NF-κB nuclear translocation in epithelial and mesothelial cells (Janssen et al., 1997). Therefore, inflammatory agents such as cytokines, chemokines, and oxidants mediate silica-induced NF-κB activity, which in turn promotes gene regulation of cytokines and chemokines in a feedback loop.

Specifically, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) isoforms, one of cytokines, are mitogenic and chemostatic for mesenchymal cells, such as fibroblasts. They have autocrine and/or paracrine function in the development of asbestosis. Furthermore, PDGF-AA and its receptor, PDGF-α, are early initiators of a fibroproliferative response involving a paracrine loop of cytokines (Lasky et al., 1995, 1998; Lindroos et al., 1997; Liu et al., 1998). Previously, we reported that silica directly stimulates Rat2 cells and that this stimulation results in the generation of PDGF-AA (Kim et al., in press).

Therefore, we demonstrated, in this study, that the addition of silica augmented the activation of NF-κB in Rat2 cells dose-dependently (Fig. 1). This result indicates that silica activates NF-κB in Rat2 cells via some intracellular signaling pathway. Recently, it has been reported that TAK1 and NIK are involved in NF-κB activation in the IL-1 signaling pathway. IL-1 has been implicated in the pathogenesis of pulmonary fibrosis including silicosis (reviewed by Robledo and Mossman (1999)). Briefly, when IL-1 binds to cell-surface type-1 IL-1 receptor (IL-1RI), IL-1RI forms a complex with an IL-1-receptor accessory protein, resulting in recruitment of MyD88 and of the Ser/Thr kinase IRAK (IL1 receptor-associated kinase) to the receptor. IRAK then dissociates from the receptor complex and interacts with TRAF6, which transduces the IL-1 signal to TAK1 (Cao et al., 1996a,b; Wesche et al., 1997; Ninomiya-Tsuji et al., 1999). TAK1 activates a MAPK cascade leading to JNK activation and a kinase cascade composed of NIK and IkB kinase (IKK), finally leading to NF-κB activation (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al., 1999).
In order to elucidate the mechanism of activation of NF-κB in Rat2 cells by silica, we investigated whether TAK1 and NIK participate in the signaling pathway induced by silica. Initially, we transfected wild type TAK1 and NIK into Rat2 cells and examined NF-κB activity with or without the silica stimulation. Mock transfectant did not affect the enhancement of NF-κB activity with silica stimulation, whereas expression of wild type TAK1 and NIK exhibited the enhancement of NF-κB activity with silica stimulation (Fig. 2). Then, co-transfection with dominant negative mutant of TAK1 and NIK was performed. As expected, NF-κB activities were activated in Rat2 cells by silica. However, NF-κB activity was inhibited by co-transfection with dominant negative mutant of TAK1 and NIK (Fig. 3). These data suggest that TAK1 and NIK signaling is involved in the silica-stimulated, NF-κB activation pathway in Rat2 cells.

Finally, we examine the phosphorylation of TAK1 induced by silica. Previously, several groups reported that TAK1 is phosphorylated and that the phosphorylation correlates well with kinase activity when TAK1 is activated (Ninomiya-Tsuji et al., 1999; Sakurai et al., 1999). Accordingly, the phosphorylation of TAK1 by silica stimulation was analyzed in Rat2 cells. As shown in Fig. 4, we determined that TAK1 is activated by phosphorylation in the silica-stimulated Rat2 cells. This result implies that TAK1 plays a crucial role in the silica-stimulated activation of the NF-κB signaling pathway.

In conclusion, NF-κB is activated by silica stimulation in Rat2 cells. TAK1 and NIK signaling is involved in the silica-stimulated, NF-κB activation pathway in Rat2 cells. Specifically, TAK1 is activated by phosphorylation in the silica-stimulated Rat2 cells. These data suggest that the direct contact of fibroblasts with silica stimulate NF-κB activation via TAK1 and NIK signaling.
