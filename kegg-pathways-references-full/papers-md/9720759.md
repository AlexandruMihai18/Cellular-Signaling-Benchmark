ABSTRACT. The process of membrane fusion is separated into three steps: docking, priming and fusion. The last fusion step of most regulated exocytosis is triggered by cytosolic free calcium (Ca²⁺). However, enzyme secretion from the parotid salivary glands is regulated by the accumulation of intracellular cAMP, although Ca²⁺ does augment the cAMP-induced secretion. The difference of the regulatory mechanisms is thought to be due to the brake points that will be passed upon stimulations. Vesicles of Ca²⁺-regulated exocytosis such as neurotransmission and norepinephrine release from chromaffin cells are waiting for the stimulation docked to the plasma membrane, and Ca²⁺ triggers the membrane fusion after the priming. In contrast, secretory granules of parotid acinar cells begin exocytosis with the docking step that may be regulated by cAMP. After the start of the docking, the exocytotic process of enzyme release runs a similar course to that of the neurotransmission: the priming and the Ca²⁺-enhanced fusion steps. Therefore, there are probably some common mechanisms involving the SNARE proteins both in Ca²⁺-regulated exocytosis and cAMP-dependent secretion.

INTRODUCTION

Most regulated exocytoses have been reported to be triggered by the elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺. Neurotransmission at synapse, norepinephrine release from chromaffin cells, insulin release from pancreatic β-cells and amylase secretion from pancreatic exocrine cells are all commonly regulated by cytosolic free Ca²⁺. However, cAMP-dependent regulation also is present in some tissues—for example, hormone release of pituitary cells [1] and glucagon-induced insulin release from β cells [2]. The exocytosis in the salivary glands such as the parotid and submandibular glands also is induced by intracellular cAMP—reviewed in [3].

In the salivary glands, there are two secretory pathways: protein exocytosis and fluid secretion (Fig. 1). Sympathetic stimulation leads to the activation of adenylate cyclase and accumulation of intracellular cAMP. The elevation of cAMP causes the secretion of proteins such as amylase and mucin. In contrast, parasympathetic stimulation activates phospholipase C and causes the elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺, which leads to fluid secretion; that is, water and ion transport [3]. Whereas other exocytosis systems are mainly regulated by Ca²⁺ and are sometimes modulated by intracellular cAMP [1, 2], protein secretion of the salivary glands can be solely or mainly induced by cAMP [4]. Therefore, the question arises, are the salivary glands such special tissues?

SNARE Proteins in Various Systems

Various proteins that are essential for exocytosis in the neuronal cells have also been found to take part in other systems of vesicle transport. Common proteins have important roles for constitutive exocytosis and intracellular vesicle transport conserved from yeast to mammalian cells [5, 6]. In particular, the so-called SNAP receptor (SNARE) proteins function in the recognition between vesicles and target membranes [7, 8]. For example, the SNARE proteins in the neuronal cells are vesicle-associated membrane protein 2 (VAMP-2) as vesicle SNAREs (v-SNAREs) and syntaxin-1 and synaptosome-associated protein of 25 kDa (SNAP-25) as target membrane SNAREs (t-SNAREs).

FIGURE 1. Two secretion pathways in parotid acinar cells. β-Adrenergic (β) agonists cause the activation of adenylate cyclase and the subsequent accumulation of intracellular cAMP (cAMP<sub>i</sub>). cAMP induces exocytosis of amylase. α-Adrenergic (α) or muscarinic (m) cholinergic agonists activate phospholipase C and cause an elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Ca<sup>2+</sup> also induces amylase secretion, but the amount is smaller than that induced by cAMP. Fluid secretion occurs by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

For analysis of the role of SNARE proteins in neurotransmission, neurotoxins such as botulinum toxins (BNTs) and tetanus toxins were used. These toxins are homologous heterodimers, in which the heavy chains are required to enter into the neuronal cells, and the light chains are zinc endopeptidase to cleave SNARE proteins [9, 10]. VAMP-2 is cleaved by BNT-B, -D, and -F and tetanus toxin [11–13]. BNT-A and -E cleave SNAP-25 [14, 15] and type Cl cuts syntaxin-1 [16]. This is considered to be the mechanism by which the toxins inhibit neurotransmission at the synapses. With the use of these toxins, the role of SNARE proteins in various systems of exocytosis also were examined.

BNT-F and -G and tetanus toxin light chain are known to inhibit granule-mediated secretion in PC12 neuroendocrine cells, indicating that VAMP-2 is essential for exocytosis in PC12 cells [17]. In pancreatic β-cells, VAMP-2 and cellubrevin are expressed and essential for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced insulin secretion [18]. Tetanus toxin light chain cleaved VAMP-2 in pancreatic exocrine cells and inhibited Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent amylase secretion [19]. In neutrophils, VAMP-2 is also expressed and localised at tertiary granules and secretory vesicles where exocytosis takes place upon an increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> [20]. These results suggest that VAMP-2 commonly functions in the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked exocytosis. However, we found that VAMP-2 is localised at secretory granule membranes in rat parotid acinar cells and is essential for the exocytosis induced by cAMP [21]. It seems unusual that the same protein functions in two apparently different regulatory mechanisms. Therefore, we are left to wonder how VAMP-2 functions in the regulatory mechanism of exocytosis.

Recently, VAMP-2 was found to be expressed in various tissues, and the distribution is wider than previously thought [22, 23]. The expression is not limited to tissues that have regulated exocytosis. Insulin-stimulated glucose transport in adipocyte and muscle is due to the translocation of the glucose transporter GLUT4 from intracellular vesicles to the plasma membrane. VAMP-2 and cellubrevin are co-localised at the GLUT4-containing vesicles, and cleavage of VAMPs inhibited the translocation of GLUT4 in adipocytes [24]. Thus, the function of VAMP-2 must be more universal and not only for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated exocytosis.

**Brake Point in the Exocytotic Process of Amylase Secretion**

Regulated exocytosis of the neurotransmitter can be divided into three steps: (1) docking of vesicles to the plasma membranes, (2) priming accompanied by ATP hydrolysis and (3) fusion triggered by the elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> [25]. How is the process of exocytosis in the salivary glands related to the three steps of exocytosis in the neuronal cells? Because the common SNARE protein VAMP-2 functions in the two systems, there seem to be some similarities between them. Our hypothesis is that amylase secretion in parotid acinar cells has three steps similar to the neurotransmitter release but the brake point is different (Fig. 2).

The lag time for exocytosis of the parotid acinar cells after agonist stimulation is considered to be more than 10 s, whereas that of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-evoked exocytosis of the neurotransmitter is within the first millisecond of the arrival of an action potential [26]. In neuroendocrine cells secreting dense core granules, measured exocytotic time was 40 ms [27]. One explanation is that the difference in the lag time is due to the time taken to increase the second messengers. The influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> can be a fast reaction, whereas cAMP synthesis takes more time. On the other hand, the process necessary for exocytosis after the rise of the second messengers also may be different. cAMP-induced events are metabolic and enzymatic reactions including phosphorylation by

cAMP-dependent proteins kinase (PKA). Moreover, the process of exocytosis in parotid acinar cells has to begin with the docking step of secretory granules after the accumulation of cAMP, unlike that in neuronal cells.

In neuronal cells, synaptic vesicles are waiting for the signals in the docking state to the pre-synaptic membranes [25, 28]. Most large, dense core vesicles are also docked in chromaffin cells [29]. The docking step has been completed for most vesicles prior to stimulation in these systems. Then, after the priming step that is ATP-dependent, fusion takes place in an ATP-independent and Ca²⁺-dependent manner [30]. After the Ca²⁺ influx, neurotransmission release needs only the fusion step, which may be caused by a conformational change in a Ca²⁺ sensor protein such as synaptotagmin [31]. In contrast, secretory granules in the parotid acinar cells are not docked in the resting state prior to stimulation. The docking construction of secretory granules cannot be observed in morphological studies. The secretory granules (diameter is about 700–800 nm) are much larger than synaptic vesicles (~40 nm). It may be difficult for such large granules to wait for exocytosis in the docking state. Therefore, amylase secretion of parotid glands needs three steps from docking to fusion after stimulation. The start of docking may be dependent on cAMP (Fig. 2).

We found that the Rab3A protein, which is a neuron-expressed homologue of the Rab family, is also expressed in the parotid glands and localised mostly at the cytosolic fraction [21]. In neuronal and chromaffin cells, most Rab3A proteins are localised at synaptic vesicles [32]. Rab3A in the GTP-bound form works at membranes, and the GDP-bound form dissociates from membranes [33]. The Sec1 protein and its homologues are negative regulators of the SNARE complex assembly, preventing the t-SNARE from binding a v-SNARE [34]. Lupashin and Waters [35] showed that Ypt1, a member of the Rab family, displaces Sly1, which is a protein related to Sec1. This reaction is considered to be the cue for the start of the SNARE complex assembly and the interaction of vesicles and target membranes. Because most synaptic vesicles are already docked and waiting for fusion in the neuronal cells, Rab3A is probably always working for assembly of the SNARE complex. Translocation between cytosol and vesicle membranes may be repeated upon GDP/GTP exchange. von Mollard *et al.* [36] showed that Rab3A dissociates from the membrane and goes to the cytosol after exocytosis and that the dissociation is reversible. This may be the reason for Rab3A detection on synaptic vesicles. In the parotid glands, the efficiency of docking is very low prior to stimulation when Rab3A is present in the cytosol. After stimulation, Rab3A may be translocated to the secretory granule membranes and work for the docking of granules and the apical membrane.

the amount is small (Fig. 1). Cholinergic stimulation, which causes an elevation of Ca²⁺, induces only transient secretion whose initial rate is higher than that induced by cAMP [39]. However, the elevation of Ca²⁺ significantly augments amylase secretion by cAMP [38]. The addition of carbamylcholine increases the initial rate and total amount of secretion by isoproterenol, a β-adrenergic agonist [39]. cAMP probably regulates the outset of the docking, whereas the docking of synaptic vesicles in the neuronal cells is performed constantly without regulation. The docked granules in the salivary glands can be fused with apical membranes without Ca²⁺, but the efficiency goes up with Ca²⁺ (Fig. 2). It is likely that a small amount of granules are already docked to fuse slowly even in the resting states and these granules rapidly fuse with a Ca²⁺ elevation. The augmentation is considered to be partly due to the activation of protein kinase C [40]. However, the initial rate of amylase secretion by isoproterenol was not increased by the addition of phorbol esters [39]. Therefore, a mechanism other than phosphorylation by protein kinase C may effect the augmentation.

What is the role of the SNARE proteins in the parotid glands? In our study, BNT-B inhibited cAMP-regulated amylase release. In contrast, the Ca²⁺-dependent secretion of parotid acinar cells was not inhibited by BNT-B [21]. These results suggest that the steps from docking to priming are dependent on both cAMP and VAMP-2 and that the Ca²⁺-activated fusion step is independent of SNARE proteins. Additionally, in chromaffin cells, BNT-A and tetanus toxin inhibited ATP-dependent but not ATP-independent exocytosis [41]. Therefore, the SNARE proteins are needed only from the docking to the priming steps in both systems. The regulatory mechanism of the three steps in parotid acinar cells has much in common with that of the neuronal and neuroendocrine cells.

### Calcium-Dependent Enhancer and Inhibitor of Exocytosis

Synaptotagmin I is considered to be a Ca²⁺ sensor that blocks fusion in the absence of Ca²⁺ [31]. Binding of Ca²⁺ will take off the brakes and at the same time accelerate the fusion events. Synaptotagmin I is both a blocker of Ca²⁺-independent fusion and an enhancer of Ca²⁺-evoked exocytosis. For neurotransmission, it is important not to release the neurotransmitter without stimulation. In parotid acinar cells, synaptotagmin I and II were not detected [21]. Because Ca²⁺-independent secretion does not have to be blocked in the parotid glands, it is reasonable that a Ca²⁺-dependent negative regulator is not present. In fact, saliva is also secreted in the resting state, but Ca²⁺ increases the amount of released amylase and the initial rate of secretion [38, 39]. Thus, there is a certain Ca²⁺-dependent enhancer of membrane fusion. One candidate is a synaptotagmin homologue. Although we found that neither synaptotagmin I or II was expressed in rat parotid acinar cells, we have not examined them for the presence of other homologues. Synaptotagmin has eight homologues. Synaptotagmin I, II, III, V and VII have Ca²⁺-binding activity, whereas types IV, VI and

The Roles of cAMP and Ca²⁺ in Amylase Secretion of Parotid Acinar Cells

In parotid and submandibular glands, cAMP solely induces protein secretion without elevation of Ca²⁺ [37, 38]. Ca²⁺ alone also induces amylase release in the parotid glands, but

VIII do not [42]. The role of each type is not yet clear, but one of them may function in parotid acinar cells.

Another candidate is the calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion (CAPS, p145). CAPS is reported to be a cytosolic protein expressed in brain, pituitary cells, chromaffin and pancreas, all of which have Ca²⁺-dependent secretion systems [43]. Hay and Martin [30] reported that CAPS takes part in the Ca²⁺-dependent fusion of norepinephrine release in chromaffin cells but not in the Mg·ATP-dependent steps. There is a possibility that common CAPS functions in both chromaffin and parotid acinar cells. In PC12 cells, the inhibitory efficiency of an antibody against CAPS is about 90% [44]. In parotid acinar cells, the efficiency may be lower, if anything, because Ca²⁺-independent amylase secretion also exists.

## The Regulatory Mechanism of Docking

The regulatory mechanism of the docking granules in parotid acinar cells is unknown. To study the mechanism of the docking, it may be useful to investigate the reaction that starts with the accumulation of intracellular cAMP and the subsequent activation of PKA. One possibility is that PKA enhances the GDP–GTP exchange of Rab3A that causes assembly of the SNARE complex. This mechanism may be different from that of neuronal and chromaffin cells, because Rab3A is probably always working without stimulation in these cells. However, investigations into the docking of granules in the parotid glands can partly be applied to that of synaptic vesicles, because the exocytosis of neuronal and neuroendocrine cells was reported to also be activated by cAMP. In hippocampal neurones, PKA causes synaptic facilitation by directly elevating the probability of exocytosis [45]. cAMP also increased norepinephrine secretion by a pathway distinct from that governing internal Ca²⁺ levels in PC12 cells [46]. It is possible that cAMP also increases the docking efficiency in neuronal and neuroendocrine cells and that a common mechanism exists between these cells and parotid glands.

For example, synaptic vesicles are brought by kinesin protein along the microtubules from the cell body to nerve terminals. Some studies revealed the involvement of vesicular axonal transport and cAMP. The phosphorylation of kinesin by PKA reduced its binding to synaptic vesicles [47]. Releasing the vesicles at the nerve terminal is necessary for its docking to the pre-synaptic membrane. In parotid acinar cells, secretory granules are brought to and specifically fuse with the apical membranes. The migration of granules is likely to be along the microtubules and is regulated by PKA.

## CONCLUSION

Whereas the mechanism of Ca²⁺-evoked exocytosis is becoming clear and the molecules that function in the docking and fusion of membrane are being identified, the factors in cAMP-dependent secretion are not yet clarified. It is important to identify fusion proteins that interact with each other and are regulated by PKA. Of the proteins that constitute the SNARE complex in parotid acinar cells, only VAMP-2, v-SNARE, has been identified. The candidates for t-SNARE are syntaxin-4 and SNAP-23. Syntaxin-4 is a protein homologue of syntaxin-1 and is expressed in spleen, heart, and skeletal muscle. It has VAMP-2 binding activity [48]. SNAP-23 is a ubiquitous homologue of SNAP-25 and can bind to VAMP-2 [49]. SNAP-23 and syntaxin-4 possibly interact with VAMP-2 and function in membrane fusion (Fig. 3). Three Munc-18 proteins, which are mammalian Sec1-related proteins, have been identified [50, 51]. One of them, Munc-18c, can bind to syntaxin-4 [52]. It is likely that Munc-18c is a regulator in parotid acinar cells and that the interaction with syntaxin 4 is regulated by Rab3A. The PKA-dependent phosphorylation of VAMP-2, SNAP-23, syntaxin-4, or Munc-18c has not been reported. We are now investigating the t-SNARE and other fusion proteins in rat parotid acinar cells and studying the mechanism of regulation by PKA.

Common proteins control regulated exocytosis in various systems. The information from each system gives us a hint that is helpful in understanding the mechanism of other systems. As with VAMP-2, which was identified in the synapse and is now revealed to be essential for cAMP-dependent amylase release in parotid acinar cells, it is possible for the information from parotid glands to provide feedback into the study of neurotransmission.
