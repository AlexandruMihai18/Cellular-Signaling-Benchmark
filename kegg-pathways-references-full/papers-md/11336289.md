### 1 Introduction and list of abbreviations used

This two-part review summarises the literature for the biosynthesis of Type I polyketide biosynthesis in bacteria from the end of 1994 through to mid-2000, and should be read in conjunction with other recent reviews on polyacylides (fatty acids, polyketides and non-ribosomal polypeptides) in *Natural Product Reports*¹⁻⁴ and elsewhere. The second part of this review follows in the next issue of *Natural Product Reports*. References are referred to in the text (when possible) by the author for correspondence, not the first named author. A consistent set of abbreviations and biosynthetic symbols are attempted in these reviews as illustrated in Fig. 1; unfortunately a confusing variety of conventions is still used in the literature. The diagrams are sometimes labelled with biosynthetic symbols consistent with the conclusions in the literature, rather than only illustrating the exact experiments performed. Compounds are often referred to as e.g. 'Ery B', whilst a protein is 'EryB' and a gene 'eryB', and names for polyketide synthases are four capitals ending in 'S', e.g. 'NYSS' for the polyketide synthase assembling the aglycone for nystatin. For consistency and clarity, some aspects of gene and protein labelling have been modified. For example, Roman numerals at the end of a gene e.g. 'eryBVIII' is 'eryB8'. This is not conventional, as geneticists use Roman numbers for original genes, and Arabic numbering for mutations or alleles, but in dense text or complicated

In the diagrams it can be easier to distinguish between EryB7 and EryB8 than EryBVII and EryBVIII! A forward slash between domains or modules implies covalent attachment, a '+' sign means just added together.

The historical divisions between the biosynthesis of different groupings of polyacylides; the fatty acids, non-ribosomal polypeptides, aromatic and 'macrolide' polyketides are appearing increasingly blurred and artificial as the similarities in the molecular and mechanistic basis of their assembly become more apparent, as their evolution at the molecular level is being

understood, and as more and more examples of mixed or intermediate metabolites are being studied, fudging and blurring artificial and cartoon based classifications of convenience that are of our making, not nature's.

Terminology, originally based upon structure rather than biosynthesis, is increasingly confusing: all compounds in the review have in common that their assembly involves using a Type I ‘megasythase’ or multienzymatic system, where each domain is used once, to add onto a ‘starter unit’ many extender units, and ending with a termination unit. The extender units are predominantly a derivative of malonyl CoA, with an occasional aminoacyl unit. There then can follow a series of post-PKS steps usually involving oxidation and/or glycosylation. Starter units include acetate/malonate-based moieties, cyclohexylcarbonyl, 3,4-dihydroxycyclohexylcarbonyl, 3,5-aminohydroxybenzoyl based moieties, thiazole and cyclopentenone carbonyl based moieties, and chalcone/stilbene synthase assembled starter units. There appears to be no convenient term to generically describe all these biosynthetically related Type I polyketides, which would include linear polyketides, a few Type I aromatic polyketides, macrolactams, polyethers (small ring, such as monensin, and medium ring such as the brevetoxins). The term ‘macrolide’ was originally proposed by Woodward<sup>5</sup> in 1954 to refer to the 12, 14 and 16-membered ‘erythromycin like’ compounds; but has more recently also been loosely used to describe a varying number of any classes containing a lactone moiety such as polyenes and avermectins. Unfortunately this now means that there is no term for just the 12, 14 and 16-membered ‘erythromycin like’ compounds that are still frequently referred to as a group, for convenience, as macrolides, implying exclusion of the other groups, and that there is still no term to include ‘any Type I assembled polyketide’. One radical solution would be to refer specifically to the 12, 14 and 16-membered ‘erythromycin like’ compounds as ‘mesolactones’ or ‘mesolides’, and rather loosely to the entire group of Type I polyketides, many of which have much larger lactone rings, as macrolides. Unfortunately, the composition of the word ‘macrolide’ implies a lactone structure, and thus would not be appropriate for macrolactam, or linear polyketides, or mixed polyketide/peptide structures, all of which are close biosynthetic relatives of the lactones. However, the same argument can be used against the use of polyacylides to describe all of the biosynthetically related fatty acids, aromatic polyketides, Type I polyketides, non-ribosomal peptides and mixtures thereof. A possible solution would be to refer to macrolactams as azamacrolides, kendomycin as a carbamacrolide, and linear polyketides as ‘linear macrolides’—keeping both types within the overall macrolide classification. There remains no term for a macrolide containing one or more aminoacyl extender unit—peptidolide or peptidomacrolide?

The atom labelling conventions used in macrolides can be inconsistent and varies from individual macrolide to macrolide. Whilst reference is made to conventional labelling and numbering conventions previously used in the literature, in the absence of known rules these reviews will try to be consistent between different macrolides by:

a) Consider atoms belonging to the core part of the name.
i) The lactone carbonyl carbon is taken as carbon one, with numbering carbons in a linear sequence to the acyl chain terminus e.g. in erythromycin A 2, carbons 1 to 15. ii) Any methyl appendages that are part of the parent structure are then labelled in ascending order starting with those closest to the carbonyl carbon as e.g. in Ery A 2 ‘16’, ‘17’ and so on to ‘21’. A natural ethyl/alkyl appendage would have all carbons counted e.g. 19 and 20 as found in tylactone. Thus the commonly accepted 8,8a-deoxyoleandiolide would instead be 8,18-deoxyoleandiolide. iii) Sugar appendages are distinguished by primes: There appears to be some inconsistency in assigning which sugars are single prime, which are double, which are triple etc. A simple guide would be the first sugar on the lowest numbered carbon should be single prime. A disaccharide would be e.g. 1′ and 1″ with the next monosaccharide on the aglycone ring being 1‴, as for mycaminose, mycarose and mycinose respectively in tylosin. Unfortunately, the usual labelling of erythromycin A has the sugars labelled the other way around, cladinose on 3-O being double primed, and desosamine on 5-O being single primed.
b) For atoms not part of the core name. i) additional alkyl groups are attached to core carbon e.g. for erythromycin with a butanoate starter the extra methyl carbon attached to ‘core carbon’ 15 is ‘22’ and the name 15-methyl-Ery A. The corresponding acetate starter compound is 14-demethyl-Ery A. ii) An additional sugar group to the core name would be e.g. 3-O-a-mycarosylerythronolide B 4.

### 1.1 Summary of recent highlights†

The period of this review has seen a flurry of sequencing clusters in prokaryotes responsible for polyketide biosynthesis, mostly from the Streptomycetes, but also now from the Myxobacteria and Pseudomonas. These clusters usually contain genes encoding proteins responsible for building block assembly, the megasynthase, deoxysugar and aminosugar synthesis and attachment, cytochrome P-450 oxidative enzymes, regulatory proteins, and systems for protecting the host organism from its own antibiotic-autoresistance. It now seems that given time and resources, the DNA cluster for any prokaryotic polyketide from these three families (and hopefully soon the mycobacteria) can be located, the DNA cloned, relocated, and analysed through sequence alignment with known systems and overexpression in a heterologous host.

This has then been followed by the deletion or substitution from other clusters of individual domains to identify their role in the overall assembly, and successfully produce hundreds of novel structures. In just one paper, McDaniel et al. report nearly fifty new analogues of 6-dEB. There has been a rapid understanding of which parts of the DNA sequence are responsible for which regiochemistry, stereochemistry and which reactions, and the technology of ‘mix and match’ experiments to produce ‘hybrid’, ‘unnatural natural’ or chimeric metabolites is now well established. It soon became clear that any individual domain was not too fussy about its precise substrate—though most prefer the correct α and β-functionality and stereochemistry, it would often process whatever was delivered to it, for example, a domain that usually processed a pentaketide intermediate would process the analogous tetraketide intermediate. This flexibility presumably enables nature to easily evolve new systems by duplicating modules or rearranging them. However, whilst most of these experiments have successfully produced hundreds of new structures, it is much harder to understand how nature achieves the remarkable selectivity shown by these megasynthases, in directing maybe one hundred separate reactions to give only one product of defined stereo- and regiochemistry.

Initial studies involved studying fragments of the synthase, such as DEBS1/TE and analysing the products, and the effect of domain substitutions. It was quickly established that a thioesterase was required on all these systems for quick release from the synthase, and efficient production of product, though accurate kinetic studies on these enzyme systems have always been hampered by impurities.

The loading domain of the Ery and avermectin megasynthase contains just an ACP and a monocarboxylic acid (as CoA thioester) loading acyltransferase. However, most other megasynthases have a loading domain containing a protein (KAS(Q) or KSQ) homologous to the KAS, but with the active site cysteine mutated into a glutamine residue. These loading domains load the required starter unit in carboxylated form (e.g. malonyl CoA), and catalyse decarboxylation. There may be some evolutionary connection between these proteins and the chain initiating factor CIF (previously called chain length factor or KSβ) found in aromatic polyketide systems.

All six Ery ATs load only (2S)-methylmalonyl CoA, with three of the six substrates being subsequently epimerised during chain elongation to give the required methyl stereochemistry observed in 6-dEB. The corresponding KR determines C-2 methyl stereochemistry by only binding and reducing the desired 2-methyl-3-oxo epimer obtained from the KAS catalysed rapidly equilibrating mixture, and stereospecifically reducing that epimer to the 3-hydroxy moiety.

Much early work focussed on the role of domains and active sites. In recent work, Khosla et al. have shown that the linker regions are crucial in the efficient operation of the production line, and suggests that much of the low yields seen in previous work is due to incompatible linkers between inserted domains and native domains.

The DEBS proteins have been shown to exist as head-to-head homodimers, with the ‘core’ domains KAS and AT of each strand in intimate contact with each other (reminiscent of ‘minimal PKS’ in aromatic systems) and the reductive/dehydrating domains in a surface exposed loop. Complementary mutation experiments show modules to be helical, with the domains of one module passing the growing acyl chain to the domains in the next module of the complementary chain. Whilst (sadly) no polyether synthase is published, the synthase for the polynene nystatin has recently been published, and is fully processive, with a module for each step, however repetitive. The mind boggles as to the size of mega(giga?) synthases required for molecules from marine systems such as the polyether maitotoxin if a module is required for each cycle.

Part B of this review (next issue of *Natural Product Reports*) covers all other Type I macrolide systems: recent studies show that a module can be skipped, as in pikromycin synthase PIKS, to form a product one unit less, or used twice in succession (stuttering) to form a product one acyl unit longer. The tylosin cluster, and many others, contain a discrete thioesterase, 'TE2' in addition to the megasynthase's TE1. Leadlay first suggested that such discrete TE's might act as an editing mechanism, removing aberrant growing acyl chains from 'stalled' synthase proteins, freeing them up for fresh acyl chain synthesis. These small discrete TE's would be like egrets removing ticks from the backs of elephants, foraging around the surface of the megasynthase hunting for any acyl chains to hydrolyse.

There has been rapid progress in understanding the biosynthesis and attachment of deoxysugars, and the opportunities available for substituting sugars to alter biological activity. In particular, the mechanism of C-2 deoxygenation has recently been clarified. The genes for the intricate network of regulatory proteins and the factors that affect polyketide production and autoresistance are now better understood. Tylosin in particular appears to have several different mechanisms of autoresistance and regulation.

The aminoshikimate pathway is now well established, and the genes required to assemble AHBA (3-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid) appear within the polyketide cluster. The product of the first module in the rifamycin synthase (RifA) appears to be oxidised by two P-450's before transfer to the next module (RifB). However, in contrast, the origin of the 3,4-AHBA (3-amino-4-hydroxybenzoic acid) moiety in manumycin and asukamycin is the citric acid cycle.

The metabolites based upon a cyclohexylcarbonyl starter unit, such as rapamycin and FB506 appear to have an ER on the loading domain (to reduce cyclohexenylcarbonyl CoA to cyclohexanycarbonyl CoA?) and an ATP dependent carboxylic acid ligase to load the starter, rather than an acyltransferase. Instead of a TE, these systems have a pipecolate inserting enzyme (PIE) that not only forms the amide bond but also catalyses the macrolactonisation.

Two groups have recently published the synthase involved in epothilone assembly in a myxobacterium, and found a loading module, followed by a non-ribosomal peptide synthase module, followed by normal polyketide modules. Interestingly, the additional SAM derived methyl unit is added by the megasynthase. The sequence suggests that SAM binds to a SAM binding domain. The superfluous enoylreductase (no alcohol to dehydrate due to absence of active KR) still has an active histidine base that removes a C-2 proton as normal. The resulting enolate then reacts with the bound SAM. The biosynthesis of coronatine by *Pseudomonas syringae* involves both a Type I and Type II synthase.

### 2 Erythromycin

#### 2.1 Early studies

Erythromycin A 2, produced by the Gram positive bacterium *Saccharopolyspora erythraea*, and its synthetic derivatives, are clinically important antibacterial antibiotics, with multibillion pound annual sales, with a 14-membered macrolactone ring and two glucose derived deoxysugar moieties desosamine and cladinos (3-O-methylmycarose).

Erythromycin A (Ery A) has been shown to be assembled in *Sac. erythraea* (formerly *Streptomyces erythraeus*) from propionate and methylmalonate units initially forming the 'aglycone' 6-deoxyerythronolide B (6-dEB) 1, which is then further oxidised by cytochrome P-450s and glycosylated to yield erythromycin A (Ery A) (Scheme 1). Feeding experiments using radioactive, and then stable isotope labelled, propionate, methylmalonate, SAM, glucose and dioxygen revealed the origin of most atoms of Ery A (Scheme 2). Donadio *et al.* have examined the source of MMCoA.²⁸ Whilst an enzyme that preferentially carboxylates propionate over acetate has been partially purified as two chains α and β from *Sac. erythraea*²⁹ formation of null mutants of *pccB* did not affect erythromycin production, suggesting that other routes to MMCoA may be predominant. Addition of sodium [²H₂]propionate, which is carboxylated to (2S)-[2-²H]methylmalonyl CoA, labels three (C-2, C-4 and C-10, as well as propionate derived C-14) of the six 'methylmalonate' derived positions. [²H₄]Succinate, which is converted by methylmalonyl CoA mutase to (2R)-MMCoA, did not label with deuterium the other three positions with the opposite 'methyl' stereochemistry³⁰ (Scheme 3) and their origin remained unknown until recently. The isolation of blocked mutants led to the formation of the series of intermediates between 6-dEB and Ery A. There are four well-defined classes

**Scheme 2 Biosynthetic origin of atoms in erythromycin A.**

**Scheme 3 Origin of C₃-units in erythromycin A.**

of mutants designated eryA, which cannot form 6-dEB, but which can convert exogenously supplied 6-dEB to Ery A; eryB mutants which accumulate erythronolide B 3 (not erythromycin B); eryC mutants which accumulate 3-O-α-mycarosylerythronolide B 4; and eryD mutants, which accumulate erythromycin D 5 (Scheme 4). The main pathway to Ery A is C-12 oxidation by EryK to erythromycin C 7 followed by O-MeT by EryG, with as a minor pathway, O-MeT to erythromycin B 6 followed by P-450 oxidation to Ery A.

A recent paper by Kajiwara *et al.* investigates the origin of the methyl protons, and has shown that there is no exchange with the medium during the incorporation of all seven propionate derived methyl groups and all four SAM derived methyl groups by feeding \[^{13}C,^{2}H_{3}\]propionate and racemic \[^{13}C^{2}H_{3}\]-methionine respectively.\(^{31}\)

In 1984, to probe whether the ‘processive’ mechanism was in operation, Cane and Yang fed the \({}^{13}C\)-labelled NAC thioester 8 of the predicted ‘diketide’ and obtained some specific incorporation, strongly suggesting that (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate as a thioester was a true intermediate (Scheme 5).\(^{32}\) However, such experiments were dogged by low levels of incorporation, difficult passage of precursors through cell membranes, and high levels of degradation to simpler precursors, and in this case, more advanced intermediates such as putative triketides could not be specifically incorporated.

Until the 1990’s, there were only occasional and unsubstantiated reports of cell-free assembly of prokaryotic macrolide aglycones, despite extensive and heroic unreported efforts by many research teams. If the processive mode of assembly were in operation, and a separate enzyme activity required for each step, twenty-eight such activities would be required to assemble the aglycone 6-dEB 1 from propionyl CoA and methylmalonyl CoA.

### 2.2 Search for the gene cluster

In 1984, Hopwood and Malpartida located a cluster of genes responsible for the assembly of the aromatic polyketide actinorhodin,\(^{33}\) probes derived from which quickly led to the location of other gene clusters in related organisms which produced a range of other aromatic polyketides.\(^{1}\) However, probes derived from this cluster failed to locate any genes for macrolide biosynthesis—the first indication of considerable differences in the mode of assembly of aromatic and macrolide antibiotics. Thompson *et al.* in 1982 found a clone derived from *Sac. erythraea* that conferred erythromycin resistance to *S. lividans*, suggesting that the clone contained the erythromycin resistance gene *ermE.*\(^{34}\) Classical genetic experiments reported by Weber in 1988 suggested that most genes for erythromycin biosynthesis pathway were closely located to *ermE.*\(^{35}\) Katz *et al.* prepared 2000 colonies of *E. coli* containing plasmids derived from *Sac. erythraea*, and probed for those containing *ermE*, obtaining nine *ermE* containing clones.\(^{36}\) Use of the cosmid pNJI allowed the cloning and introduction of large segments of DNA into *Sac. erythraea*, and whilst somewhat unstable (preventing permanent transfer), did however allow transfer/exchange of genetic material to the host DNA to complement mutants, thus allowing the identification of genes. These cosmids were added to *S. erythraea* eryA mutants, and screened for their ability now to produce erythromycin, leading to the identification of a 5 kbp segment 12–17 kbp downstream from *ermE*, identified as part of *eryAI*. In one eryA mutant, it was shown that the original small deletion in *eryAI* had been replaced by the cosmid introduced wild type sequence, thus restoring erythromycin production. Hybridisation experiments suggested the presence of a second gene, *eryA2*, homologous to *eryAI*. Hutchinson *et al.* reported cloning of several genes

$ORF2$ and $ORF3$ are contiguous, $ORF3$ corresponding to the $eryA3$ (or $OrfA$) gene described by Leadlay *et al.* above (Fig. 2). Donadio suggests locations for all 28 activities required for 'single use enzyme' processive assembly; 8 AT domains located with a predicted signature sequence GHS*xG* motif; 6 KASs with a GPxxxxTAC*SS* motif, 7 ACPs with a LGxDS*LxxVE* motif, and 6 KR's located using GxxGxxAxxA motif proposed as a common fingerprint region in NADPH reductases by Perham *et al.* ${}^{44}$ One such KR domain, found in module three (KR3), has a gap in the sequence corresponding to the highly conserved VSRRG motif (conserved except LGRRG in Mod5) found in the other five KR domains and vertebrate FAS (TSRSG), and this KR was proposed to be non-functional. The DH and ER domains were proposed in an extended gap found in module 4 (Mod4) in the sequence between AT4 and KR4 domains, and by analogy with that proposed for rat FAS, but the extent, exact location and limits of the individual domains were not described. Donadio proposed that the linear arrangement of functional domains could correspond to the order of activities required to assemble 6-dEB. To examine this model, and to assign activities to individual domains, Donadio introduced an 813 bp in-frame deletion into the segment of DNA corresponding to the 3-oxoacylreductase domain in the 'fifth' module, and obtained 5-deoxy-3-$O$-$\alpha$-mycarosyl-5-oxo-6-dEB and 5-deoxy-5-oxo-6-dEB, the expected products if the KR in synthase unit 5 (KR5) was inactive, and the components in Mod6 can efficiently process the 'unreduced' 3-oxo intermediates. However, in a subsequent paper ${}^{45}$ (*vide infra*) Donadio reports the isolation of small amounts of 3-hydroxy-2,4-dimethylheptano-5-lactone, suggesting that the dysfunctional KR5 is slowing the overall flow of the "production line" resulting in a traffic jam and an inability of Mod3 to process all the product of Mod2, leading to some off-loading at this stage and formation of the triketide lactone.

A more detailed interpretation of an experiment performed by McAlpine *et al.* in 1987 ${}^{46}$ could now be proposed. A mutant of *Sac. erythraea* (Strain 9E141) unable to produce Ery A was transformed with the pNJ1 plasmid containing a library of 30–35 kb fragments from the oleandomycin producer *S. antibioticus*. Oleandomycin is assembled from an acetate starter followed by six propionate/methylmalonate extender units, and thus the first acyltransferase should be an acetyl CoA transferase. One clone produced antibiotics, one of which was found to be 2-demethylerythromycin A or 2-norerythromycin A, which was twenty-fold less active than Ery A, along with the corresponding 2-nor analogues of Ery B, Ery C, and Ery D. The DNA from *S. antibioticus* has presumably complemented a mutation in AT6, replacing the inactive methylmalonyl loading Ery AT6 by an oleandomycin derived malonate transferring AT, and as only the starter unit is $C_2$, presumably oleandomycin AT0. Interestingly, this implies that an AT, whilst as part of the loading domain would load acetyl CoA (presumably?), when inserted alongside a KAS, which is known to have decarboxylative powers, now loads 'malonate'. Sequencing of strain 9E141 shows that it has an 87 bp in frame deletion in AT6.

In 1992 Leadlay *et al.* published the 10.7 kbp nucleotide sequence of $orfB$ and predicted it to code for 3568 aa with $M_r$ 374 417 Da, with a high enough homology to OrfA to suggest

downstream of $ermE$ involved in deoxysugar biosynthesis or glycosylation, ${}^{37}$ and Katz reported cloning and overexpression of the $O$-methyltransferase gene $eryG$, ${}^{38}$ and Weber *et al.* reported the targeted disruption of $eryF$, which was thought to code for the cytochrome P-450 that converts 6-dEB to erythronolide B, and obtained 6-deoxyerythromycin A, which had not been previously found in mutant studies possibly due to the small size of $eryF$. ${}^{39}$ These early studies all confirmed that there was a cluster of biosynthetic genes largely to one side of $ermE$, with evidence of the PKS genes from 12 kb downstream of $ermE$.

Using an alternative approach, Leadlay *et al.* reported using the plasmid found by Thompson as a hybridisation probe, and located fragments of DNA from *Sac. erythraea* containing the self-resistance gene. These fragments were sequenced, and these data used to 'walk' (sequence overlapping restriction fragments) along the genome upstream of $ermE$. The identity of individual genes could be found by targeted gene deletion as in the case of $eryCI$, deletion of which resulted in 3-$O$-$\alpha$-L-mycarosylerythronolide B ${}^{40}$ by sequence homology as in the case of $eryG$ whose predicted aa sequence showed homology with known SAM dependent methyltransferases, ${}^{41}$ and by complementation of known mutants. In 1990, after sequencing 12 kb downstream, Leadlay *et al.* came across a 9.5 kbp region ($orfA$) of the genome containing sequences homologous to nine expected synthase components such as acyltransferases, 3-oxoacylsynthases and acyl carrier proteins, that complemented $eryA$ (synthase) mutants. ${}^{42}$ Despite extensive searching, no stop codons could be located in this first part of the $eryA$ region, leading Leadlay to propose a single genome coding for a single polypeptide containing nine FAS like domains in the same relative order as found in vertebrate fatty acid syntheses, and comprising 3178 aa of $M_r$ 332 472. This gene, $OrfA$, coded for a protein with all the activities predicted to be required for two rounds of processive assembly, along with an extra two domains at the C-terminal, an ACP and thioesterase, each activity being used only once in the sequence. The start of a second gene, $orfB$ was sequenced, and found to encode an ACP.

#### 2.3 Domain identification

In 1991, Donadio *et al.* ${}^{43}$ reported the sequencing of 35 kb of DNA including all of $eryA$ and that it consisted of three ORFs, each consisting of two repeating units (modules), with $ORF1$ and $ORF2$ separated by an insertion element of 1.44 kb, whilst

internal duplication, and containing appropriate putative active sites for the third and fourth cycle of 6-dEB processive assembly.⁴⁷ Leadlay discusses in detail the sequence alignments and domain assignments, including using the GxGxxG sequence⁴⁸ in NAD(P)⁺ binding domains corresponding to a tight fold in the βαβ fold, to locate KR's and that, as discussed by Donadio below, in an otherwise homologous region in module 3, the underlined Gx is -SP-, suggesting an inactive KR. The active site for ER in Mod4 was proposed by sequence comparison with rat and chicken FAS, with an active site histidine. As the active site for DH in FAS had not yet been located, Leadlay proposed a location for the active site for DH4 by sequence comparison with *E. coli* FabA 3-hydroxydecanoyl thioester dehydratase (HDDH), with a histidine to act as general base in a Hx₃Gx₄P motif, with little or no linker region between the predicted end of AT4 and the beginning of DH4. The authors include a detailed discussion of the Ala/Pro/charged aa rich interdomain linker regions, with a comparison to other multifunctional proteins such as Type I FAS and 2-oxoacid dehydrogenases. Many sequences involving multiples of Ala-Pro, Glu-Pro, or Lys-Pro pairs have been found to impose considerable constraints on conformational flexibility, and these linker regions may be acting as 'rigid rods' to keep domains apart, or maintain controlled flexibility between regions.

In 1992, Donadio and Katz reported further detailed analysis and sequence of the *eryA* region with detailed comparison with other sequences found in Type I FAS (Fig. 2).⁴⁹ The TE (*ca.* 230 aa) at the end of Mod6 showed relatively little homology with FAS TE's (as is also observed between short and long chain FAS TE's), but did have GxSxG and also GxH near the C-terminus in common with AT's. The authors find that the proposed DH region is short (140–170 aa) consistent with that found in Type I FAS and in *E. coli* DH, with an active site His (Hx₃Gx₄P) with two tyrosines (Y) about 110 aa later (GYxYGPxFQ). The separation of the KR and ACP domains is somewhat greater (100 aa) than in FAS (60 aa). In both DEBS2 and DEBS3 there are non-domain polypeptides at the N-terminal ends of 26 and 33 aa prior to KAS3 and KAS5, and of 69 and 63 aa at the C-terminal end of ACP4 and ACP6, similar tails not being observed in Type I FAS. The authors suggest that these tails might be involved in transfer of the growing acyl chain, interactions between modules, or even anchoring the protein to some intracellular structure. Most interesting was an examination of the large AT-KR interdomain regions in synthase units 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, and their comparison to the same region in Mod4 including the DH and ER domains. Computer alignment gave some similarity between 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, and with part of that in Mod4 when two insertions of 152 and 315 aa length were included, these two insertions corresponding closely to the DH and ER domains. Sequence comparison of ACPs shows greater homology between PKS Type I and FAS Type I than even between Ery PKS Type I and FAS Type II in the same organism. The finding of these DH and ER linkers suggest they may be fossilised relics from an intact FAS Type I element, which after duplication six-fold, has lost enzyme activity but presumably retains overall structural or architectural function.

In a second paper, Donadio *et al.* showed that the start codon for *eryA3* follows immediately on from the stop codon for *eryA2*, and that the 1.44 kbp insertional element between *eryA1* and *eryA2* has only 63% G+C content, significantly lower than the usual 73% (Fig. 2).⁵⁵ The authors found four other homologous DNA fragments elsewhere in the *Sac. erythraea* genome, and that it contained significant homology with an 'IS' gene from *Anabaena*. The antisense insertional segment may be co-transcribed with all three *eryA* genes, but it is not known whether it has a function. The proposed domains were analysed: the six KAS domains (410–422 aa) were the best conserved, with 164 invariant positions. In a subsequent paper Donadio *et al.* altered the sequence in the proposed ER

domain. Many NAD(P)H binding motifs have two adjacent binding glycines in a HAAAGGVG sequence, which have been substituted by -SP- in the corresponding motif in the 'inactive' KR domain in Mod3.⁵⁰ Presumably the turn imposed by proline disrupts the folding in the cleft, preventing binding of NAD(P)H, but does not cause so much disruption to inactivate neighbouring domains. Thus Donadio replaced the DNA sequence of these two glycines in the putative ER of module 4 by those coding for -SP-, and the resulting fermentation produced two novel metabolites, one of which was identified as Δ⁶,⁷-anhydroerythromycin C, produced at *ca.* 20% the levels of macrolide production by the parent strain. Whilst KR5 and ER4 have been successfully disrupted, there is no record of how many unsuccessful attempts there have been to produce similar disruptants—it is always salutary to remember that molecular biology cannot achieve the chemically unreasonable. Leadlay⁵¹ reports that disruption of DH4 (active site His) abolishes all macrolide synthesis, as Joshi and Smith find that disruption of the equivalent His in DH in FAS abolished all FAS synthesis.⁵²

### 2.4 Overexpression in *E. coli* and protein characterisation

Previous efforts to efficiently overexpress Streptomyces proteins in *E. coli* had been thwarted by the reluctance of *E. coli* expression systems to recognise the high G-C codon usage in Streptomyces DNA sequences. After altering the bases in four of the first six codons to form codons readily expressed by *E. coli*, Leadlay *et al.* were then able to overexpress the C-terminal region (357 aa) of DEBS3 (containing the ACP6 and TE) in *E. coli*, using the pT7-7 plasmid system. This was the first overexpression of a macrolide polyketide synthase component. Initial experiments resulted in high levels of inclusion bodies, but use of only brief heat shock treatment followed by rapid cooling and incubation at a relatively low temperature gave soluble protein (20% of total).⁵³ A second protein (*M*~r~ 51 kDa) was also produced at much lower levels, and found to be EryC2, suggesting that *eryC2* was translationally coupled to the adjacent *eryA*. ESMS analysis of the ACP6/TE protein corresponded to the expected mass with N-terminal methionine still attached (38150 Da) with some (20%) without the methionine (38019 Da), but no species could be detected corresponding to a phosphopantetheinylated form of the ACP domain, indicating that the *E. coli* holo-ACP synthetase (ACPS) did not recognise this ACP domain. Treatment with the serine protease inhibitor phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) led to attachment of one unit of inhibitor, as found with such treatment of FAS TE activities. Limited proteolysis gave a stable fragment (33 kDa) corresponding to a conformationally stable TE, the ACP N-terminal fragment was rapidly degraded, suggesting that the ACP domain is unstructured, or less able to exist as a discrete species. Further proteolysis suggested that Ser-216, as part of a GHSAG sequence, was the active site residue reacting with PMSF.

In 1992, Leadlay *et al.* reported developing an antiserum against the DEBS3 ACP/TE previously overexpressed in *E. coli*, and showed that this antiserum reacted with a minor protein band of *M*~r~ 270 kDa present in crude cell-free extracts from *Sac. erythraea*.⁵⁴ Antibodies raised against part of DEBS2 reacted with a separate higher *M*~r~ protein tentatively assigned to be DEBS2, and a third protein band, detected by staining, of intermediate *M*~r~, was assigned DEBS1. These assignments were confirmed by further purification to near homogeneity followed by N-terminal sequencing. However, the N-terminal sequence of DEBS1 corresponded to a predicted amino acid sequence starting 155 bp upstream and in a different reading frame to that previously proposed⁴³ with an alternative ribosome binding site upstream. However, the authors were not able to demonstrate 6-dEB synthesis from these DEBS preparations.

In 1993 Leadlay *et al.* overexpressed the entire EryA3 (DEBS3) in *E. coli* using the pT7-7 plasmid system and

obtained 2–3 mg purified protein from 40 g wet cells.55 Using a strain unable to synthesise its own β-alanine, Leadlay showed that added radioactive β-alanine was not incorporated into DEBS 3, indicating that it had not been post-translationally modified. Size exclusion chromatography suggested the Mr was 668 kDa, i.e. that DEBS 3 was a dimer in solution, even when the salt concentration was raised to 300 mM NaCl. The purified protein was radiolabelled by racemic methylmalonyl CoA (but not malonyl CoA) at 0 °C, which was lost after 1.5 h incubation. In the following paper by Leadlay et al.,56 this experiment was repeated with (E. coli) overexpressed DEBS 1 and DEBS 2, with analogous results. TLC analysis suggested that the products of the hydrolysis were methylmalonate and CoASH, and the enzyme after 2 h, could be equally efficiently relabelled. If instead of adding more racemic MMCoA after 2 h, methylmalonyl CoA epimerase isolated from Propionibacterium shermanii was added, about half the original level of radiolabelling was restored. This strongly suggested that in the original experiment, only one enantiomer of racemic methylmalonyl CoA had reacted with the enzyme, and that the enzyme does not possess its own epimerase activity. Addition of any other DEBS protein to a preincubated DEBS protein, led to no additional labelling, showing that all three DEBS reacted with the same enantiomer. The authors then prepared each enantiomer of radiolabelled MMCoA, and found that (2S)-MMCoA bound DEBS 1, 2 and 3, whilst (2R)-MMCoA did not bind DEBS 2 or 3 and only very weakly bound DEBS 1, due to a small level of radiolabelled propionyl CoA in the preparation. This DEBS 1 labelling could be prevented by preincubation with unlabelled propionyl CoA. Limited proteolysis showed the (2S)-MMCoA was attached only to the acyltransferases.

In 1994, Leadlay et al. reported the limited proteolysis (using four different proteases) of DEBS 1 overexpressed in E. coli.57 The intact protein behaved as a dimer by gel electrophoresis as found previously for DEBS 3. Gentle proteolysis by trypsin gave three fragments, presumably certain interdomain loops are located near the surface of the complex and are readily accessible (Fig. 3); a C-terminal fragment (219 kDa; KR1/ACP1/KAS2/AT2/KR2/ACP2) that remained as a dimer in solution, a homodimeric central fragment (KAS1/AT1, ca. 90 kDa) and the N-terminal didomain that comprised the AT0 and ACP0 (57 kDa) that behaved as a monomer (different domain numbering

used in paper). Labelled propionate labelled the N-terminal fragment, indicating that it did indeed help load the ‘starter unit’, whilst incubation of the other two fragments with labelled MMCoA indicated that even after proteolysis, the acyltransferase domains remained catalytically intact, though labelling of the KAS1/AT1 fragment was weak, suggesting that ACP0 may be closely associated with these proteins. However, it seems that these three main fragments are independently folded and do not closely interact with each other. After prolonged trypsin proteolysis, the N-terminal fragment lost ca. 10 aa at its N-terminal ‘end’, and became 56 kDa (aa 12–547), the C-terminal fragment underwent cleavage between KR2 and ACP2, followed by cleavage between AT2 and KR2. Whilst single domain KR2 was observed (as a monomer in solution), no other single domains were observed, suggesting that their conformation is intimately dependent upon their neighbours, and that in isolation they unfold and are rapidly degraded. No cleavage was observed between KAS2 and AT2, suggesting that KAS and AT are very intimately associated. Proteolysis with elastin gave the ACP1-KAS2 linker as a major cleavage site.

Proteolysis experiments on DEBS 1 and DEBS 2 are illustrated in Fig. 3. All the KAS/AT didomain remained as homodimers in solution, whilst reductive domains were monomeric. The AT domains after proteolysis still bound their substrates. Proteolysis after crosslinking with 1,3-dibromopropane (which crosslinks ACP-SH and KAS-SH) gave a different pattern of crosslinking, which suggested that the ACP-SH crosslinked with the KAS-SH from the opposite chain, as is also observed in animal FAS.56–58 These proteolysis experiments suggest a dimeric structure in which the KAS and AT are intimately associated, with KR/DH/ER reductive loops not in the ‘core’ part of the structure.

### 2.5 Overexpression of DEBS in CH999

The expression of DEBS in E. coli was leading to inactive protein, as the E. coli acyl carrier protein synthase (ACPS) cannot post-translationally modify the Sac. erythraea derived macrolide ACP domains. In 1994, Khosla, Katz and Kao reported the first overexpression of an active macrolide polyketide synthase59 using the pCK7 shuttle vector containing the complete set of eryA genes and transforming into the recently developed

![Diagram](attachment:Fig_3_Limited_proteolysis_of_DEBS.png)

S. coelicolor CH999, in which all the Act genes have been excised.⁶⁰ The plasmid also contains a copy of act2-ORF4 and act1 promoter, resulting in overexpression of recombinant genes at the onset of the stationary phase in a quasi-natural manner. The CH999 overexpressed the entire 6-dEB synthase coding for 10,283 aa to give *in vivo* production of 6-dEB1 (40 mg L⁻¹) and 8,18-deoxyoleandrolide (8,8a-deoxyoleandrolide) (10mgL⁻¹), the same structure as 6-dEB except with an acetate starter unit. Thus this Streptomyces possesses a holo-ACPS that can efficiently post-translationally modify macrolide ACPs, and any other proteins needed to give active correctly folded protein, and has all the auxiliary proteins that may be required for efficient macrolide biosynthesis. The amount of 8,18a-deoxyoleandrolide could be reduced by adding propionate to the medium, suggesting that it is a high level of intracellular propionate in Sac. erythraea that contributes to the exclusive use of propionate as starter unit, and that there is a much lower level of MMCoA decarboxylase present in S. coelicolor.

In 1995, Khosla *et al.* report the isolation and purification of all the DEBS proteins using size exclusion chromatography and were able to obtain *in vitro* synthesis of 6-dEB from radiolabelled propionyl CoA, methylmalonyl CoA and NADPH. Thus the DEBS complex contained all the proteins necessary to assemble a macrolide aglycone.⁶¹ Cane *et al.* added the labelled diketides (2S,3R)-[2,3-¹³C₂]- and (2S,3R)-[3-²H,-3-¹³C]-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoyl NAC thioester (along with the fatty acid oxidation inhibitor 4-pentynoic acid) to the actively growing S. coelicolor CH999 and isolated 6-dEB containing 15–20 atom% label in the expected diketide positions—labelled about one-hundred-fold more efficiently than that obtained with wild-type.⁶²

### 2.6 Structure of DEBS

In a seminal paper in 1996, Leadlay *et al.* proposed two different helical dimer models for DEBS.⁵⁸ A detailed analysis of ultracentrifugation analyses of proteolytic fragments showed fragments to be stable and homodimeric except the loading domain and the reductive domains. Intersubunit KAS-SH↔HS-ACP thiol crosslinking studies on whole module fragments were successful, but not on fragments lacking an ACP. DEBS overexpressed from E. coli, without ACP-Pant-SH, does not crosslink. In Model A, two linear parallel polypeptide chains line up side by side, with successive KAS and ACP's from each chain in close proximity with each other and those in the other chain forming a rod-like core, with the AT's and other domains looping out sideways but still in reach of the ACP swinging arm. Thus reductive domains from different polypeptide chains are not in close proximity with each other, and after limited proteolysis would not be expected to form homodimers. In Model B, the two polypeptide chains are wound around each other to form a helix, which would be expected to be a more stable arrangement than the side-by-side model. Model B is illustrated in Fig. 4a (photograph courtesy of J. Staunton). Fig. 4b is a model representation of DEBS1/TE. These dimeric arrangements have several flexible advantages. The processing of the growing acyl chain is dependent upon the positioning of each domain, and each module or multienzymatic complex in a particular sequence in a 'rod'. Successive multienzymatic complexes would need to stack up in the right order based upon specific recognition of C-, and N-terminal peptide sequences at the end of the nth and (n+1)th covalent unit (no reports of polyketide production from DEBS1-DEBS3 binding to form a pentapeptide). This model would allow the insertion of extra modules, and the genetic (and thus covalent) fusing of neighbouring modules to form the two-module ORFs (and larger elsewhere) to form, without disrupting the overall biosynthetic assembly—and presumably in evolutionarily sustained cases, enhancing it. Due to the length of any such rod-like structure, it is tempting to propose

Fig. 4 Arrangement of domains in DEBS (4a) and DEBS1/TE (4b).

that they are supercoiled in some manner; this would also presumably enhance stability to proteases *etc*. It is interesting to speculate on whether the ACPS adds the phosphopantetheine prosthetic group onto each ACP-Ser-OH prior to formation of the double helix; or whether the ACPS can reach the buried apo-ACP after double helix formation.

Recently the structural organisation of Type I FAS has been investigated using complementary mutants.² In 1996 Khosla *et al.* formed complementary mutants in DEBS1/TE to show the presence of two catalytically independent active sites within each module.⁶³ Mutation of KAS1, KAS2 or ACP2 all inactivated (homodimeric) DEBS1/TE. However, using the technique of complementary pairs, where for example, the KAS1° homodimer and KAS2° homodimer are mixed, monomerised, and then redimerised, to give a statistical mixture of homo and heterodimers, and examined for activity, Khosla *et al.* found that KAS1° and KAS2° (Fig. 5a); or KAS2° and ACP2° (Fig. 5b) mutant pairs could complement each other, but not a KAS1° and ACP2° mutant pair (Fig. 5c). For example, the Kcat for the KAS1°/KAS2° hybrid dimers was found to be 1.7 min⁻¹, about 25% of that for normal DEBS1/TE, the maximum statistically expected for full complementarity. Thus one protein subunit contributes KAS1 and ACP2, whilst the other KAS2 and presumably ACP1. On this basis, Khosla proposed that DEBS1/TE forms a head-to-tail homodimer generating two sets of equivalent and independent active sites, in contrast to the head-to-head or slightly twisted head-to-head models proposed by Staunton *et al.* that would not be consistent with the proposed 5.6 nm distance between TE domains. The traditional head-to-tail models proposed for animal FAS are also now being questioned after complementation studies that show that the FAS DH can interact with the ACP domain of the same subunit.⁶⁴

The AT2° mutation (S2649A) gives inactive DEBS1/TE, as AT1 cannot transfer methylmalonate to KAS2. In 1998, Khosla *et al.* mixed AT2° with KAS1° (Fig. 6b) or KAS2° (Fig. 6a), and found that both heterodimeric pairs supported polyketide production at similar rates, about 30% DEBS1/

lar rate, a steady state 'flow' is achieved; as an acyl chain departs  
from an ACP, its place is immediately taken by the acyl unit  
next in the queue. In related work, it has been shown that the  
growing acyl chain can also 'skip' a module—see pikromycin  
(Part B of review). If the KAS is unable to catalyse, or too slow  
at catalysing, a Claisen condensation, it is thought that KAS  
mediated ACP to ACP(+1) transfer can take place. It is inter-  
esting to speculate on the product if a full synthase has a KAS  
active site cysteine mutated into an alanine, whether the system  

would now produce a shorter macrolide containing one less  
acyl group. The remaining part of the KAS would recognise,  
handle and transfer the growing acyl chain, but no actual  
chain extension could take place.

2.7 DEBS1/TE

In 1994 Khosla *et al.*⁶⁶ reported the expression of DEBS1 (3544  
aa) in CH999, which *in vivo* produced the expected triketide

in low yield (1–3 mg L⁻¹), previously isolated from a mutant of
Sac. erythraea,⁴⁵ this was the first demonstration that an individual bimodular unit could work in isolation (Scheme 6).
Unfortunately the authors did not report the presence or absence of the corresponding nor-analogue 11 with an acetate starter unit.

Leadlay et al. fused the C-terminal half of ACP6 and all of the TE onto the N-terminal half of ACP2 of DEBS1 by deleting all of DEBS2 and most of DEBS3 in Sac. erythraea (Scheme 6).⁶⁷ The thioesterase would now be correctly located to assist in triketide lactone formation, if it could accept the corresponding triketide. The resulting Sac. erythraea produced no detectable macrolactone, and produced the triketide lactone 10 as essentially a single compound (9 mg L⁻¹), levels comparable to the production of 6-dEB in wild-type. As the 'pre-TE' ACP is composed of half of ACP2 and half of ACP6, the authors suggest that the 'pre-TE' ACP has little role in TE-substrate selection. Additionally, to show that the near 10-fold increase in triketide lactone production (compared to the absence of TE, vide supra) was not merely caused in some way by just the (non-catalytic) presence of an extra domain, the authors mutated the TE's active site serine (S3029A) resulting in less than 1% as much triketide lactone production. In a second paper, Leadlay et al. then showed that cell-free extracts given propionyl CoA, racemic MMCoA and NADPH can make the triketide lactone (and some from the acetate starter), and they purified this activity to 95% homogeneity from Sac. erythraea,⁶⁸ which was inhibited by either PMSF or cerulenin. This 'Cambridge' DEBS1/TE could efficiently accept acetyl, butanoyl and 2-methylpropionyl CoA as a starter unit, but not pentanoyl, 2-methylbutanoyl, hexanoyl, or (E)-but-2-enoyl CoA (Scheme 7). Other studies had shown that all six AT's of DEBS are highly specific for (2S)-MMCoA⁵⁶ and Leadlay showed this was also the case with partially purified DEBS1/TE. Leadlay et al. have now reported in detail an efficient purification and characterisation of their DEBS1/TE obtained from overexpression in Sac. erythraea,⁶⁹ and obtained a Kcat for triketide lactone formation of 0.84 min⁻¹ and KM for (2RS)-methylmalonyl CoA of 17 μM, using protein of much higher purity than in earlier studies, giving a specific activity of 2.1 nmol min⁻¹ mg⁻¹, and isolating 10 mg of essentially pure protein from a litre of culture. The two-step purification procedure is much quicker and yields ten times as much protein as previous protocols, with less degradation. The catalytic efficiency is ten times lower than that obtained with the alternative engineered DEBS1/TE (see below) and may be due to the hybrid nature of the 'pre-TE' ACP, and confirms that ACP's do indeed have a role to play in efficient substrate recognition and processing.

† The early literature has (2R,3S,4S,5R) stereochemistry.

2.7.1 DEBS1/TE in CH999

Khosla et al. report fusing the DEBS1 and TE at the carboxy terminal of ACP2, and expressing the 'Stanford' DEBS1/TE in CH999 (Table 1); this strain produced in vivo the triketide lactone 10 (20 mg L⁻¹), but also significant levels of nor-triketide lactone 11 using acetate as starter unit (10 mg L⁻¹) (Scheme 8).⁷⁰

In 1995 Khosla et al. showed that the 'Stanford' DEBS1/TE in CH999 could process acetyl CoA, propanoyl CoA or butanoyl CoA (plus NADPH and MMCoA) into the corresponding triketide lactones 10, 11 and 12 (Scheme 9).⁷¹ The isolated protein was equally well radiolabelled by acetate, propionate or butanoate, suggesting no discrimination by the AT0. Labelled diketide (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoyl NAC thioester 8 was processed by the protein as a diketide, and extended to the normal triketide lactone 10, showing that it had been recognised as an analogue of the diketide enzyme intermediate. Omission of NADPH gave the corresponding ketone (2R,4S,5R)-2,4-dimethyl-3-oxoheptano-5-lactone 15 in

Nat. Prod. Rep., 2001, 18, 190–227 201

that for DEBS1/TE is presumably due to inefficient assembly of the multienzymatic complex in the right orientation under the conditions of this assay.

In 1996 Khosla *et al.* used PCR to inactivate KR2 in DEBS1/TE in CH999, and obtained (2R,4S,5R)-2,4-dimethyl-3-oxoheptano-5-lactone 15 (20 mg L⁻¹) and lower levels of the corresponding nor-3-oxolactone derived from an acetate starter unit (7 mg L⁻¹).⁷⁵ Replacement of KR2 by the domain corresponding to the inactive Ery KR3 gave the same products, albeit in reduced yield, with no evidence of reduced triketide lactones 10 or 11. Thus moving the 'inactive' KR3 to new surroundings (where reduction normally occurs, and a large putatively important AT-KR interdomain linker is present) had not reactivated it. In 1997 Khosla *et al.* engineered specific restriction sites either side of the KR2 domain, without functionally altering the activity of DEBS1/TE.⁷⁶ This allowed the functional replacement of Ery KR2 by Ery KR5 with production of triketide lactone remaining comparable to previous levels. However, replacement of KR2 by KR6 resulted in loss of reductase activity, giving the 3-oxo-triketide lactone 15 (20 mg L⁻¹). Replacement of AT2/KR2/ACP2/TE by AT6/KR6/ACP6/TE still only gave the 3-oxolactone 15, i.e. the inactivity of KR6 was not due to incompatibility with AT2 and ACP2, but presumably incompatibility with the substrate. In conclusion, it seems that KR6 has somewhat stringent substrate specificity, but KR5 is more relaxed.

In 1997, Khosla *et al.* examined the ability of the ACP2 (and KAS2) in the 'Stanford' DEBS1/TE to recognise and process analogues of the natural diketide substrate 8, using a KAS1° mutant of DEBS1/TE unable to produce its own diketide for processing to triketide lactones.⁷⁷ The homo-analogue, (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylhexanoic acid, NAC thioester 16 was surprisingly processed to 17 about 75% faster than the natural diketide 8, which was processed to 10 at four times the rate that the butanoyl analogue 18 was processed to 11 (Scheme 10). The epimeric (2R,3R)-diketide 19 was completely inactive as a substrate with no formation of epimeric lactone 20, and the 2-demethyldiketide 21 was processed to 22 at half the rate of the natural diketide. The 3-deoxy analogue 23 did not result in any of the expected 3-hydroxyacid 24, but did result in the cerulenin inhibited low-level formation of a polar compound which unfortunately was not further investigated. It has previously been shown that KAS2 in DEBS1 will accept 3-oxo-analogues, and much longer chains,⁷⁸ and with an intervening double bond, with a C-5 hydroxy instead of a C-3 hydroxy.

In 1998, Leadlay *et al.* comprehensively examined the substrate recognition and processing of NAC-diketide analogues by the 'Cambridge' DEBS1/TE.⁷⁹ The authors found that diketide NAC thioesters were loaded efficiently, despite the activity of KAS1, and that addition of the diketide NAC analogues suppressed loading domain activity. In the experiments below, much higher concentrations of NAC thioesters (6 mM) are required than the corresponding CoA thioesters (300 μM). The results are illustrated in Scheme 11:

a) Stereochemical variation: All three stereoisomers of the natural diketide 8: 25; 27 and 29 were not processed to the corresponding triketide lactones 26, 28 and 30 respectively.

b) Variation in C-2 unit: (2S,3R)-2-ethyl-3-hydroxypentanoyl analogue 31 was not processed to 32, but the (2S,3R)-2-ethyl-3-hydroxy-4-methylpentanoyl analogue 33 was processed, but at too low level for full structural elucidation of the product thought to be 34. The authors suggest that a C-2 ethyl group is only poorly accommodated in the active site.

c) Variation in the starter unit: As found with previous studies, a wide range of starter units was acceptable, including acetate analogue 35 processed to 11, butanoyl analogue 36 processed to 12, 2-methylpropanoate analogue 37 processed to 13 and phenyl analogue 38 processed to 39, with some MS evidence of low level cyclohexyl diketide analogue 40 being processed to 41.

d) 3-Oxo substrates: two 3-oxo-diketide analogues were tested. With an acetate starter 42 there was no processing to 43, but with 2-methylpropanoyl starter 44, the 3-oxo group was reduced stereospecifically, presumably by KR1, and incorporated into the corresponding reduced triketide lactone 13. Thus KR1 recognises the 3-oxo diketide NAC thioester with a bulky starter unit, and will stereospecifically reduce it ready for transfer to KAS2 and further processing.

Wilkinson *et al.* have rationally inserted domains from the rapamycin synthase (RAPs) from *S. hygroscopicus* into DEBS1/TE to obtain triketide lactone structures analogous to those seen in the cholesterol lowering statin drugs such as lovastatin. The target lactones (e.g. 47) differ from the normal DEBS1/TE triketide lactones 10 and 11 in having no methyl substituents at C-2 or C-4, and the hydroxy group at C-3 is epimeric. To obtain these lactones, the authors used DNA from RapMod11 and RapMod12 to rationally insert into DEBS1/TE. Substitution from the middle of ACP1 to an equivalent point in ACP2 with the corresponding RapACP11 to ACP12 and overexpression in *S. lividans* failed to produce any triketide lactones. However, replacement of EryAT2/KR2/ACP2 with RapAT12/KR12/ACP12 gave triketide lactones 45 and 46 as expected without a methyl appendage on C-2 and the desired epimeric hydroxy stereochemistry, at 1–3 mg L⁻¹, about 10% that for triketide lactones from DEBS1/TE. Extending the substitution to EryKAS1 through to ACP2 by the corresponding domains in RapMod11+12, fused at the carboxy terminus to EryTE, gave no triketide lactone product. However, only replacing EryAT1 through EryACP2 now gave the desired lactones 47 and 48, though in low yield. The authors suggest that the linking region between ACP and KAS(+1) is very important and vulnerable to change, and that it is more appropriate to form fusions between KAS and AT or between reductive domains. A much improved yield (1 mg L⁻¹) of the desired lactones 47 and 48 was obtained by replacing EryAT1 by the acetate loading RapAT2, and EryAT2/KR2/ACP2 by RapAT12/KR12/ACP12. In order to test the importance of maintaining 'native' ACP-KAS(+1) links, the authors constructed a bimodule in which the 'unnatural' join is between EryKR1 and ACP2, ACP2 linking naturally to KAS3 of EryMod3, and obtained the corresponding 3-oxo-lactones 49 and 15 in very high yield (35 mg L⁻¹). The authors then extended this by constructing a trimodule (EryAT0 through to KAS2 joined to RapAT11 through to ACP12 joined to EryTE) with all-native ACP-KAS links and obtained modest yields of tetraketides 50 and 51 (1 mg L⁻¹).

### 2.8 Trimodular systems

In 1996 Khosla *et al.* report inserting DEBS1 and Mod3/TE into CH999 and obtaining a tetraketide lactone (2R,4R,5S,6S,7R)-7-hydroxy-3-oxo-2,4,6-trimethylnonano-5-lactone (CK13a) 52 (20 mg L⁻¹) and decarboxylated lactol (CK13b) 53 (5 mg L⁻¹) (Scheme 12) and extensively analysed the structure and conformation of both products by NMR. Whilst yields are high, and comparable to previous triketide lactone production by DEBS1/TE, it is not known the extent to which the TE, in addition to catalysing the release of linear acyl chain

DEBS1 + Ery Mod3/TE → CK13a (20 mg/L) + CK13b (5 mg/L) via Scheme 12 DEBS1 protein and Ery Mod3 + TE protein overexpressed in S. lividans.

product from the synthase, actually catalyses the formation of the six-membered rings in preference to formation of the alternative but thermodynamically and kinetically less favoured 8-membered rings. The 3-oxolactone 52 rapidly tautomerises in water to the corresponding enol.

In 1997 Khosla *et al.* reported the purification of TE fused to Mod3. This was the first purification of a single active module; purification by size exclusion chromatography gave a sharp peak, and attempted co-purification with DEBS1 showed very little association between the two proteins. Crosslinking studies on Mod3/TE alone produced a mixture of dimeric and trimeric species, but no crosslinking was observed between DEBS1 and Mod3/TE. However, DEBS1 and Mod3/TE (even with ten-fold excess Mod3/TE) forms a mixture of the tetraketide lactone 52 and lactol 53 (in a 5:1 ratio) twenty times slower than DEBS1/TE forms triketide lactone, presumably due to inefficient transfer of triketide from DEBS1 to Mod3. The authors observed that the addition of Mod3/TE to DEBS1 increased the level of triketide lactone formation over that found for DEBS1 alone. They suggest that this may be because of the association of DEBS1 and Mod3/TE into a head-to-tail trimodular assembly in which the TE is close enough to both the growing chain attached to either ACP2 or ACP3. This would be in contrast to the currently accepted head-to-head models. Thus, the action of TE to release DEBS1 triketide lactone competes with the interprotein transfer of the growing acyl chain to Mod3. Another possible explanation is that the Mod3, in the absence of a partner such as Mod4, has a less efficient conformation and can only inefficiently extend the diketide chain, and instead the module is 'skipped', the diketide acyl chain being bound and passed along by Mod3 to the TE, but not being processed. A similar process is thought to explain the formation of methymycin (*vide infra*).

In a so-called 'gain of function' autogeneses experiment, Khosla *et al.* replaced KR2 in DEBS1 + Mod3/TE by Rap DH4/KR4 and obtained two unsaturated and decarboxylated linear tetraketides (5 mg L⁻¹), one with a propionate starter (4E,6R,7R)-7-hydroxynon-4-en-3-one 54 and the nor-analogue with an acetate starter unit 55 (Scheme 13). The Rap DH4 has dehydrated the triketide alcohol, and Ery Mod3 has processed a precursor with an E-double bond that cannot fold back on itself like the natural precursor, forming lactones.

In 1997 Khosla *et al.* replaced parts of Mod3 in the trimodular system by corresponding domains in Ery Mod6, chosen because of the similar stereochemistry performed by

Mod3 and Mod6. Replacement of ACP3/TE by KR6/ACP6/TE gave the 3-oxo-tetraketide lactone (CK13a) 52 and lactol (CK13b) 53 in good yields (10–20 mg L⁻¹) in which the KR6 has not reduced the tetraketide substrate presented to it in this system (Scheme 14) similar to the substrate stringency found when KR6 was inserted into DEBS1/TE (see section 2.7.1). To test the role of the interdomain linker region before the ACP or KR domains, the authors replaced 'interdomain linker3'/ACP3/TE (shown in Scheme 14 as three dots) by 'inter-domain linker6'/KR6/ACP6/TE, and AT3/linker3/ACP3/TE by AT6/linker6/KR6/ACP6/TE, but only obtained the same products 52 and 53 with no KR6 activity. Fusion of the entire Mod6 onto DEBS1 gave no detectable products. However, translational fusion of DEBS1 and Mod3 to give a three-module PKS by joining the stop codon of Mod2 with the start codon for Mod3, retaining either all 117 non-conserved aa between ACP2 and KAS3 or all 25aa of the segment linking Mod5 and Mod6, gave in both cases unreduced tetraketide 3-oxolactone 52 and lactol 54 in yields comparable to DEBS1 + Mod3/TE, demonstrating that units can be covalently linked without loss of activity. However, none of these experiments gave 3-reduced triketide lactone, presumably due to stringent substrate specificity of the KR6.

The authors then replaced domains by those from Rap; Rap AT4 is thought to be an MMCoA transferase. Replacement of Ery ACP2 by Rap ACP4 gave tetraketide lactone 52 and lactol 53 as before, *i.e.* Rap ACP4 can complement Ery ACP2. Replacement of Ery KR2/ACP2 by Rap DH4/KR4/ACP4; Ery AT2/KR2 by Rap AT4/DH4/KR4, or Ery AT2/KR2/ACP2 by Rap AT4/DH4/KR4/ACP4 all gave the same linear unsaturated decarboxylated tetraketide 54 as above (Scheme 13), though in much lower yield (20%) in which Rap DH4 has desaturated the growing acyl chain preventing lactone formation.

In another example of so-called 'gain of function' autogeneses, Khosla *et al.* in 1997 replaced KR2 of DEBS1 + Mod3/TE by Rap DH1/ER1/KR1 and obtained a nonano-7-lactone (2-oxocanone) in high yield (20 mg L⁻¹) (Scheme 15). The formation of a δ-lactone has been prevented by the full elimination and further reduction of the corresponding hydroxy, resulting in an otherwise hard to get 8-membered ring lactone (2S,3S,4R,6R,7R)-3-hydroxy-2,4,6-trimethylnonano-7-lactone 56, which may have useful synthetic or medicinal consequences, and demonstrates that the TE can catalyse formation of an 8-membered ring. In addition, the product has an unexpected and unaccountable reduction at C-3, for which there is no assigned PKS activity, and is presumably catalysed by a non-PKS enzyme present in the CH999. In a second experiment, KR2 (in DEBS1/TE) was replaced by Ery DH4/ER4/KR4, but this resulted in only the formation of linear decarboxylated tetraketide 54, showing that the Ery ER4 was inactive in Mod2, unable to operate on a triketide intermediate.

### 2.9 DEBS3 (substrate specificity of upstream modules)

In 1998 Khosla *et al.* reported the isolation of a triketide lactone (2R,3S,4R,5S)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxyheptano-5-lactone 57 from a CH999 strain containing DEBS(1+2+3) with inactive KAS1, 'KAS1°', that had the expected stereochemistry of a triketide produced only by DEBS3, *i.e.* 'DEBS3/TE'

yield. Khosla *et al.* have inactivated KAS1 (C729A) in DEBS in CH999, and then introduced a variety of bulky diketide analogues such as 58a and 60 obtaining loading directly onto Mod2 and transformation into the corresponding 15-ethyl-6-dEB 58 and 14-demethyl-14-phenyl-6-dEB 61 which were then converted by *Sac. erythraea* eryA mutants to the corresponding EryD analogues 59 and 62.⁷⁸ Presumably the oxidation at C-12 (and, surprisingly, the sugar O-methylation) to give Ery A analogues does not take place due to the C-14 substitution (Scheme 17).

Addition of the tylosin triketide, a *trans*-α,β-unsaturated 4-methyl-5-hydroxy triketide 63 (without a C-3 hydroxy group, but correct stereochemistry at C-4 and C-5 for recognition by KAS3) to DEBS1 (KAS1°) led to formation of a 16-membered macrolactone 64 in high yield (25 mg L⁻¹), showing that Ery TE can catalyse formation of a 16-membered ring, and that this triketide binds to KAS2 and is extended to the octaketide, rather than binding to KAS3 with extension to the heptaketide, as was expected. Once again, the enzymes in Mod3–6 are accepting the considerably altered intermediates being passed on to them by module two, and processing them, without complaint. In 1998 Khosla *et al.* reported adding the C-4 epimer of tylosin triketide intermediate, 65, to DEBS (KAS1°) and obtained the fourteen membered heptaketide lactone 10,11-anhydro-6-dEB 66 (2 mg L⁻¹) and the formation of only low levels of the corresponding 16-membered octaketide lactone epimeric to 64 at C-14 (0.2 mg L⁻¹) (Scheme 18).⁷⁷ Thus the alteration of the stereochemistry at C-4 is now leading to binding to module 3 rather than module 2, and consequent heptaketide formation. The authors note the close relationship between modules 2–6 of the heptaketide Ery system, and modules 3–7 of the 16-membered lactone octaketide tylosin (Tyl) system, and suggest an evolutionary link in which there has been loss or gain of an early module.

Khosla *et al.* have added a variety of functionalised analogues of the diketide NAC thioester to DEBS1/TE KAS1° to probe what functional groups the DEBS protein will accept and insert into this part of 6-dEB, and be available for subsequent synthetic modification (Scheme 19).⁸⁸ Addition of a long hydroxy-functionalised alkyl chain, (2S,3R,13RS)-3,13-dihydroxy-2-methyltetradecanoyl NAC thioester 67 produced 15-(8-oxononyl)-6-dEB 68 in reasonable yield (4 mg L⁻¹). However, the enantiomeric (2R,3S) isomer of 67 gave no product. Addition of a diketide 69 with a 2-methoxy group replacing the diketide 2-methyl group gave the corresponding 12-demethyl-12-methoxy analogue of 6-dEB 70; and addition of the 4,5-didehydro analogue, (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-methyl-4-pentenoyl NAC thioester 71 gave the corresponding ‘ene’ functionalised 6-dEB 72 (Scheme 19).

In 1995 Khosla *et al.* attached TE to the end of Mod5.⁷⁰ Overexpression gave copious quantities of the corresponding 12-membered lactone hexaketide (20 mg L⁻¹) (8R,9S)-8,9-dihydro-9-hydroxy-8-methyl-10-deoxymethynolide 73, analogue of the aglycone of methymycin, showing that Ery TE can efficiently form a 12-membered lactone (Scheme 20). The 12-membered ring methymycin is frequently a co-metabolite along with the 14-membered pikromycin or narbomycin.

In 1999, McDaniel *et al.* replaced KR6/ACP6/TE in DEBS by Pik ACP6/TE from the 12-membered macrolide methymycin and 14-membered macrolide pikromycin producer *S. venezuelae*.⁸⁹ The Ery KR6 was deleted, as in Pik Mod6 there is no 3-oxoreductase. The Pik gene cluster is thought to be responsible for producing both 12- and 14-membered macrolides, and also has a second, discrete, TE, Pik TE2 associated with the cluster, of uncertain function. The resulting clone produced only the expected 14-membered macrolide 3-deoxy-3-oxo-6-dEB 74, with no evidence of 12-membered macrolide production, suggesting that it is the environment of the TE that determines mode of lactonisation, rather than selectivity of the TE itself (Scheme 21).

5 and 6, all of which are similar in that they normally produce alcohol functionality, and most single substitutions led to the production of modified 6-dEB in yields from 1–70% of that for the parent production of 6-dEB.

Single substitutions of Ery domains by Rap domains are illustrated in Fig. 8; for clarity, an asterisk highlights changes in structure.

The malonyl specific Rap AT2 was used to substitute for MMCoA specific Ery AT’s, with considerable success; substitution of AT1 by Rap AT2 gave 12-demethyl-6-dEB 75; AT2 by Rap AT2 gave 10-demethyl-6-dEB 76; AT3 by Rap AT2 gave 8-demethyl-6-dEB 77; AT5 by Rap AT2 gave 4-demethyl-6-dEB 78 and AT6 by Rap AT2 gave 2-demethyl-6-dEB 79. Unfortunately there is no report of replacement of AT4 by Rap AT2. It is curious why, presuming it has been attempted, it fails.

There is no Rap KR2, instead, all there is between Rap AT2 and Rap ACP2 is a short conserved 18 aa linker region. In order to achieve the functional deletion of the KR regions, the authors replaced the Ery KRs by this linker. Replacement of Ery KR2 by the 18 aa linker gave no product, suggesting that module three cannot process 3-oxoacyl chains. Replacement of Ery KR5 gave 5-deoxy-5-oxo-6-dEB (10%) 80, and replacement of KR6 gave a mixture of 3-deoxy-3-oxo-6-dEB (30%) 81 and 2-demethyl-3-deoxy-3-oxo-6-dEB 82 (40%), suggesting that the specificity of AT6 is affected by the absence of KR6 or the presence of a linker region whose native AT is malonate loading.

The next experiments involved replacing the Ery AT/KR by Rap AT2/linker region. Replacement of Ery AT2/KR2 gave no product, whilst replacement of AT6/KR6 gave 83 (20%).

The next experiment was ‘gain of function’ replacement of Ery KR by Rap DH4/KR4. Replacement of Ery KR2 gave 10,11-anhydro-6-dEB 66 (2%); Ery KR5 gave 4,5-anhydro-6-dEB 84 (trace); and Ery KR6 gave 2,3-anhydro-6-dEB

85 (40%). Direct replacement of Ery KR6 by Rap KR2 gives 3-epi-6-dEB 86.

The next experiments were replacement of Ery KR by Rap DH1/ER1/KR1. Replacement of Ery KR2 gave 11-deoxy-6-dEB 87 (20%); KR5 gave a mixture of mainly 80 (50%) and 5-deoxy-6-dEB 88 (4%); whilst replacement of KR6 gave a mixture of 81 (30%) and 85 (20%). Most of these substitutions gave the expected compound, but the formation of both the oxo compound as well as the expected fully reduced compound after replacement of Ery KR5 by Rap DH1/ER1/KR1 suggests that Rap KR1 only slowly reduces the 3-oxohexaketide, and that transfer directly onto module 6 competes with reduction. Similarly, replacement of Ery KR6 by Rap DH1/ER1/KR1 gave no fully reduced compound, only a mixture of oxo- and unsaturated products, again suggesting that the reductions (but not the dehydration) are slow compared with transfer onto TE and lactonisation.

Substitution of both a core domain and a processing domain within the same module was examined. As illustrated above, replacement of Ery AT6/KR6 by Rap AT2 and the AT-ACP linker gave a reasonable yield (20%) of the expected compound 83, but other such combinations proceeded in only very low

yield (<0.5%): replacement of AT2/KR2 by Rap AT2/DH4/KR4 gave 66 (trace), and AT6/KR6 gave 3-epi-2-demethyl-6-dEB 88a (trace). Replacement of Ery AT2/KR2 by Rap AT2/DH1/ER1/KR1 gave 10-demethyl-11-deoxy-6-dEB 88b (trace), and replacement of AT6/KR6 gave 2-demethyl-3-deoxy-3-oxo-6-dEB 82 (trace).

The authors then proceeded to perform double and triple substitutions in two or three different modules, based upon combining the most successful single mutations, and usually obtained the expected compounds, though in much lower yields. In general, they found that if the two single modifications were successful, the combination modification would be as well.

The first set of dual module experiments are in Mod2 and Mod5 (Fig. 9). For clarity, changes in structure are highlighted by an asterisk: replacement of AT2 by Rap AT2 and KR5 by the linker region gave 10-demethyl-5-deoxy-5-oxo-6-dEB 89; AT2 by Rap AT2 and KR5 by Rap DH4/KR4 gave 4,5-anhydro-10-demethyl-6-dEB 90; AT2 by Rap AT2 and KR5 by Rap DH1/ER1/KR1 gave a mixture of 10-demethyl-5-deoxy-5-

library of compounds that doubled the number of known 12-membered macrolides. In other experiments, use of a KAS1° null mutant of eryA1, cotransformed with the eryA2 and eryA3 variants, supplied with the NAC thioester of homologous diketide, gave a library of 15-methyl homo-analogues of 6-dEB.

Whilst this approach has delivered a small quantity of many novel compounds suitable for a library, there may be inherent problems associated with retaining three plasmids within a cell, or producing larger quantities. The future combinatorial insertion of all three variant DEBS into the actual genome may allow the formation of more stable larger scale systems.

### 2.11 Loading domain

The N-terminal of DEBS1 contains an additional region of DNA, prior to KAS1, the ‘loading domain’ of 556 aa; a 107 stretch of amino acids of ill-defined structure/function followed by AT0 and ACP0. This 107 aa chain seems to precede all seven AT’s in DEBS, and presumably is either part of a larger than expected AT domain, or is crucial in interdomain/inter-multienzyme interactions. The loading domain loads acetate or propionate *in vivo*, but can load acetate, propionate, butanoate and 2-methylpropanoate *in vitro*. AT0 has been shown to bind to acetyl propionyl or butanoyl CoA, but preferentially transfers propionate to ACP0 from whence it is transferred to the active site Cys of KAS1 for condensation.

In a recent paper, Khosla *et al.* have functionally over-expressed AT0/ACP0 in *E. coli*.²² Coexpression of the phosphopantetheinyl transferase from *Bacillus subtilis* led to high levels of holo ACP. Competition experiments showed that the relative loading rates of substrates were: propionyl CoA, 100; butanoyl CoA, 60; acetyl CoA, 50; 2-methylpropanoyl CoA, 38; (2E)-but-2-enoyl CoA, 30; benzoyl CoA, 0; phenylacetyl CoA, 9; 3-hydroxybutanoyl CoA, 2; racemic-methylmalonyl CoA, 11; malonyl CoA, 4. Both the AT0 and ACP0 active sites could be loaded. The recombinant AT0/ACP0 is more permissive than DEBS (which has a 32-fold preference of propionyl CoA over acetyl CoA), implying that the linker attaching ACP0 to KAS1 partly determines starter unit specificity.

In 1998, Pereda *et al.* at the Abbott laboratories generated mutant strains of *Sac. erythraea* that lacked either AT0 or both AT0 and ACP0. Both strains were able to produce Ery A, but at much reduced levels (0.5%), with no evidence of acetate used as a starter. When AT0 was expressed as a monofunctional protein, this led to increased levels (5% wt) of Ery A production. Pereda proposed that in the absence of AT0 and ACP0, polyketide production is initiated by the loading of KAS1 with propionate directly from propionyl CoA (the KAS1 recognising the similarity between the ACP phosphopantetheine arm and CoA).²³ Alternatively, MMCoA could be loaded onto AT1, and back-transferred onto KAS1. To distinguish between these alternatives, Pereda replaced the MMCoA specific Ery AT1 with the malonyl CoA specific AT2 from a PKS cluster in *S. hygroscopicus* in the AT0/ACP0 missing mutant. This resulted in the production of 12-demethyl-12-deoxy-Ery A 124, with no evidence of acetate being used as a starter. Thus in the AT0/ACP0 mutant, Ery production is initiated by direct loading of KAS1 by propionyl CoA, not backtransfer of decarboxylated MMCoA from AT1 to KAS1, which in the AT1(A) mutant would have resulted in backtransfer of acetate giving 12,14-dimethyl-12-deoxy-Ery A 125 (Scheme 22).

To test what part of the protein specifies propionate as starter unit, Pereda substituted the AT0/ACP0 mutant’s Ery KAS1 with niddamycin KAS1 from *S. caelestis*. Niddamycin has an acetate starter. However, this strain continued to produce Ery A, not 14-demethyl-Ery A, implying that it is not the KAS1 that determines the starter; though any KAS1 substrate preference

for e.g. acetate may actually be being overwhelmed by high levels of available propionate and low levels of acetyl CoA in the *Sac. erythraea* cells.

Pereda deleted just the 107 aa fragment at the N-terminus, causing loss of all macrolide biosynthesis, demonstrating its importance. Pereda noted the presence of similar sequences in AT's from other macrolides, mycocerosic acid synthase, and plant phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL).

Type I FAS is reported to have malonyl CoA decarboxylase activity, and DEBS has been reported as capable of providing its own starter unit by decarboxylation of MMCoA. This would interfere with attempts to incorporate unnatural starters by removing propionate as the synthase would then produce its own supply from MMCoA. Recently, purified DEBS1/TE was also reported to contain decarboxylase activity. The conditions which are reported to maximise MMCoA decarboxylation are an absence of propionyl CoA and other starters such as butanoate. In order to rigorously examine whether DEBS1/TE can decarboxylate MMCoA, Staunton *et al.* in 1998 added [2-²H]MMCoA to purified DEBS1/TE, butanoyl CoA and NADPH. The first extender unit MMCoA is epimerised during incorporation and thus loses its deuterium, the second extender unit should retain its deuterium. The triketide lactone product 10 derived from propionate starter was analysed by MS and found to contain <5% two deuteriums (two deuteriums would have been the expected outcome if all the propionate starter was derived from decarboxylation of labelled MMCoA; one from propionate and one in the second extender unit) and mainly (>95%) only one deuterium—in the second extender unit position. The butanoate derived triketide lactone 17 contained a single deuterium as expected (Scheme 23). Other assays in D₂O confirmed that the origin of the propionate starter was not decarboxylation of MMCoA, as no deuterium was detected in the 'propionate starter CH₃' positions, whilst deuterium was adventitiously incorporated via the solvent into the C-2 position. Similar results were obtained when the butanoyl CoA was omitted. Also, in a time course study, propionate lactone 10 production tailed off (whilst butanoate derived lactone 17 had a steady increase in rate of production to a maximum), indicating that a small propionyl CoA contamination in the MMCoA samples was being rapidly consumed by DEBS1/TE. Spectral analysis of commercial MMCoA shows that it contains sufficient amounts (5%) of propionyl CoA to account for all the propionyl derived triketide lactone produced. [2-²H]MMCoA was obtained by exchange in D₂O from commercial MMCoA and would still contain 5% unlabelled propionyl CoA, with presumably a low percentage of that being adventitiously (5%) monodeuterated resulting in the observed 5% dideuterated triketide lactone 10.

The earlier reports of DEBS1/TE decarboxylase activity might be explained by some residual MMCoA decarboxylase enzyme in previous batches of ‘pure’ DEBS1/TE, an enzyme that has been characterised from *Sac. erythraea*. This work supports the results of Pereda (vide supra) in which he showed that in an AT0/ACP0 mutant, propionate is loaded directly onto KAS1, rather than obtained via decarboxylation on AT1 and backtransfer.

The loading domain of the avermectin PKS can load at least 44 different starter units onto the PKS, including cyclohexanecarboxylic acid leading to the unnatural commercially important avermectin ‘Doramectin’ which is more active against parasites than the ‘natural’ avermectins. In 1998, Leadlay *et al.* reported the substitution of the Ery AT0/ACP0 loading module in DEBS1/TE and in the full DEBS by the loading module of AVES1 from the avermectin producer *S. avermitilis*, to give a wide variety of triketide lactones with acetate/propionate/3-methylbutanoate and 3-methylpentanoate starter units (10 mg L⁻¹) and erythromycins 126–137 with a wide variety of different starter units (Scheme 24).

Leadlay *et al.* have replaced the loading module on DEBS1/TE with the as yet unreported [KAS(Q)/AT0/ACP0] loading module for the polyether monensin, which normally loads a C₂ unit as starter. Incubation with malonyl CoA and MMCoA resulted in triketide lactone 11 with an acetate starter unit, plus some ‘propionyl’ lactone 10 due to contamination of MMCoA with propionyl CoA. However, incubation with acetyl CoA and

MMCoA did not result in any triketide lactone 11 with an acetate starter unit, only some propionyl lactone 10. Thus whilst the erythromycin (and avermectin) type AT0/ACP0 loading domains load the monocarboxylic acids (as thioesters) as starter units, the KAS(Q) type load the corresponding dicarboxylic acids (as monothioesters), coupled with decarboxylation, and spurn monocarboxylic acid thioesters. Mutation of the glutamine for alanine in the KAS(Q) reduced lactone formation by ten-fold, indicating their crucial role of the glutamine residue. Thus the KAS(Q) domains may play a very similar role in Type I modular PKSs as the CLF or KASβ enzymes in Type II aromatic polyketide synthesis as a chain initiating factor (CIF). The authors propose that the glutamine amide residue acts as a general acid polarising the malonyl ACP thioester, triggering decarboxylation, or that it could act as a general base by direct bonding to the malonyl carboxylate. It was observed back in 1977 that iodoacetamide treated FAS could decarboxylate malonyl CoA, the ω-amide group attached to the KAS cysteine thiol presumably having a similar role. These KAS(Q)s, and their connection to CIFs provide a tantalising evolutionary link between Type I and Type II polyketide synthesis, which promises to reveal information about their development and mechanism.

### 2.12 Acyltransferase (AT)

The six KAS sites all receive only (2S)-MMCoA from the six highly substrate specific AT's, to give a mixture of methyl appendage stereocentres and in the absence of growing acyl chain, have been (disputably) reported capable of catalysing decarboxylation to propionate (*vide supra*).

The AT domains are believed to form part of the structural core of any PKS module, and have been thought to be harder to substitute in 'mix and match' experiments. Leadlay *et al.* have reported sequence differences between MMCoA specific and malonate specific AT's. One main difference in the active site motif is that propionate specific ATs normally have GHSQQG whilst acetate specific motifs (and starter ATs) are GHS(V/I/L)G.

In 1996 Leadlay *et al.* substituted the malonate loading Rap AT2 for Ery AT1 in DEBS1/TE in CH999 and obtained the expected 4-demethyl triketide lactones (2R,3S,5R)-3-

hydroxy-2-methylheptano-5-lactone 22 and (2R,3S,5R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylhexano-5-lactone 138 in good yield (comparable to DEBS1/TE) and in similar amounts (Scheme 25). Thus both 3-oxoreductase steps are unaffected by the absence of the methyl group on the growing acyl chain, the absence of other diastereoisomeric products indicates that the stereo-fidelity of the reactions is maintained.

In 1997 Katz *et al.* reported the substitution of MMCoA specific Ery AT1 and AT2 in *Sac. erythraea* by putatively malonate specific AT obtained from *S. hygroscopicus* ('Hyg AT2'), a 'Ven AT' obtained from the pikromycin producing strain of *S. venezuelae*, and Rap AT14 from *S. hygroscopicus*. Replacement of Ery AT1 by any of these AT's led to the production of 12-demethyl-12-deoxy-Ery A 124 (as found earlier, Scheme 22) the highest yield obtained from Hyg AT2 insertion, comparable to wild-type. Replacement of Ery AT2 led to the formation at much reduced yields (<20% parent strain) of 10-demethyl-12-deoxy-Ery A 139 and 10-demethyl-Ery A 140 (suggesting weak substrate activity of 10-demethyl-Ery D for the C-12 hydroxylase EryK) (Scheme 26). Interestingly, the authors also report that replacement of AT3,4,5 or 6 by Hyg AT2 does not lead to detectable levels of any Ery analogues.

In an example of functional domain replacement in a full-length PKS, followed by production of an antibiotic analogue, Liu *et al.* replaced AT6 of DEBS in CH999 with the malonyl transferring Rap AT2 and obtained the expected 2-demethyl-6-dEB 79 (15 mg L⁻¹) and the corresponding nor-analogue 141 with an acetate starter (10 mg L⁻¹). These were then fed

to an eryA mutant of *Sac. erythraea* and converted into the corresponding erythromycins 2-demethyl-Ery A 142 and 2,14-didemethyl-Ery A 143, which could be analysed for antibacterial activity (Scheme 27).

In 1998 Stassi *et al.* replaced the MMCoA loading Ery AT4 in *Sac. erythraea* by an ethylmalonyl CoA loading AT (Nid AT5) from the PKS (NIDS) responsible for assembling the 16-membered macrolide niddamycin. However, the strain still only produced Ery A, with no evidence of any 'ethyl' appendage by ESMS. Reasoning that the Nid AT5 would load MMCoA in the absence of EtMCoA, they added the EtMCoA precursor butanoate to the medium, and obtained an additional product of slightly higher $R_f$ than Ery A at similar level of production. Addition of butanol or ethylmalonate gave very low levels of the new compound, but addition of diethyl ethylmalonate (10 mM) gave mainly the new compound, that by ESMS corresponded to ethyl appended macrolide 18-methyl-Ery A 144 (Scheme 28). Thus levels of EtMCoA are limiting the production of the novel macrolide. In Streptomycetes, two molecules of acetyl CoA are joined to 3-oxobutanoyl, and then reduced to butanoyl CoA that can then be carboxylated to EtMCoA. The authors overexpressed the (2E)-but-2-enoyl CoA (crotonyl CoA) reductase gene *ccr* from *S. collinus* into the Nid AT5 containing strain of *Sac. erythraea*, with a strong promoter, at a site distant from the Ery gene cluster. The modified strain had Ccr activity over twenty times higher than the parent *S. collinus* strain, and produced exclusively the ethyl appended macrolide 18-methyl-Ery A with the same stereochemistry as Ery A. However, the novel macrolide 144 had much reduced antibacterial activity relative to Ery A.

Cane, Khosla *et al.* have investigated the role of AT domains in choosing the extender unit, and its stereochemical fate. They have previously shown that the KR and the ACP domains are not responsible for the epimerisation. The authors examined the role of AT on the stereochemical fate of a (2S)-methylmalonyl CoA unit: the two extender units of the DEBS1/TE system end up with opposite stereochemistry, the first having been epimerised. If epimerisation occurs prior to condensation, it would then be expected to be catalysed or at least affected by the AT domain. To examine this, the AT domains in DEBS/TE were sequentially replaced by EryAT4 (it is not known whether any such epimerisation occurs in Mod4), but had no effect upon the stereostructure of the resulting triketide lactone product 10, though production levels were lower (Scheme 29). The authors concluded that the AT has no role in determining whether or not epimerisation of methylmalonate extender group occurs, thus by a process of elimination, this must be controlled by the KAS domains.

Whilst many MMCoA loading modules have had their AT(P) successfully replaced by an AT(A), the resulting titres are often low. Replacement of DEBS1/TE AT2(P) with RAPS AT2(A) gives the expected 2-demethyl triketide lactone (3S, 4S,5R)-3-hydroxy-4-methylheptano-5-lactone 145 in good yield (10 mg L⁻¹, half that of the parent triketide lactone 10 from DEBS1/TE). However in the complete DEBS system in CH999, when AT2(P) was replaced by RAPS AT2(A), only trace amounts (<1 mg L⁻¹) of a metabolite thought to be 10-demethyl-6-dEB 76 was produced (Scheme 30). The authors conclude that the RAPS AT2 is fully capable of loading the malonate extender, but that some downstream enzymes in later modules only reluctantly process the modified intermediates, or that there are less efficient intermodule interactions. To examine which regions of the AT domain are actually responsible for substrate selection, the authors constructed four hybrid ATs from complementary parts of the DEBS AT2(P) and the RAPS AT2(A). Two hybrids were unable to produce any detectable polyketide, and the other two both produced 6-dEB, with no demethyl products. In order to avoid effects from poor downstream processing, the authors then performed the analogous experiment in which AT6(P) from the complete DEBS was replaced by hybrid Ery AT6/RAPS AT2. Liu *et al.* have shown that full replacement of DEBS AT6(P) with RAPS AT2(A) led to formation of 2-demethyl-6-dEB in good yield (10 mg L⁻¹). Cane, Khosla *et al.* found that one RAPS AT2/DEBS AT6 hybrid (in which 89 bp of DEBS AT6 was replaced by 68 bp derived from RAPS AT2) replacing AT6 in DEBS now led to production of both 6-dEB and 2-demethyl-6-dEB in comparable amounts (5 mg L⁻¹ each). This suggests that this short fragment of 35 aa (containing a high proportion of charged residues) in these acyltransferases are important for determining substrate specificity. Sequence comparison amongst analogous segments in other AT domains revealed a high variability both in length and sequence, and was quite different from the corresponding region in *E. coli* FAS, whose crystal structure has been determined, and the authors suggest it is a hypervariable region responsible for substrate specificity—though Leadlay *et al.* have identified signature motifs that differentiate between malonate and methyl malonate binding ATs.

### 2.13 Stereochemistry of KAS and KR

The six Ery KAS sites all receive only (2S)-MMCoA from the six highly substrate specific AT1-6's, to give a mixture of methyl appendage stereocentres. In 1996 Cane and Khosla performed a series of experiments to locate the exact site of the KAS

**Scheme 27**

active site cysteine by site specific mutagenesis; 109 both C729A and C2200A DEBS1/TE were incapable of triketide lactone 10 formation, though both bound radiolabelled propionyl CoA.

Incubation of DEBS1/TE KAS1° (C729A) with diketide-NAC thioester 8 plus MMCoA and NADPH restored triketide lactone formation, indicating that Mod2 was fully active in this mutant. The C2200A mutation removes the active site thiol from KAS2 and the resulting DEBS1/TE KAS2° mutant no longer bound or processed the diketide (2S,3R)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoic acid, NAC thioester 8 i.e. KAS1 does not bind or recognise diketide 8 at all. In wild-type, or either mutant, there was no attachment of diketide 8 to the thiol of ACP1, suggesting that exogenously added diketide NAC thioester 8 is directly loaded onto the KAS2 thiol. Presumably the ACP1, whilst it may need to recognise or bind precursors prior to the reduced diketide (such as the 3-oxodiketide) it will not recognise or bind the reduced 3-hydroxy-diketide, so as to facilitate and encourage transfer onto the KAS2 thiol, i.e. reduction of 3-oxodiketide ACP1 thioester by KR1 prompts the transfer to KAS2.

In 1997 Leadlay et al. examined the stereochemistry of the condensation step. 110 DEBS1/TE was incubated with butanoyl CoA as starter (to avoid detecting products from decarboxylated MMCoA), NADPH and racemic [2-2H]MMCoA (only the S-isomer incorporated), and the resultant deuterated triketide lactones 17 analysed by GCMS and NMR (Schemes 31 and 32). The rate of lactone 17 formation was linear with time over 1.5 h, enabling time course analysis of deuterium content, allowing the elimination of any effects due to the first order exchange of label with solvent, and the product lactone was only deuterated at C-2. This indicates that the condensation performed by KAS1 involves loss of the C-D of MMCoA to give unlabelled diketide intermediate 146 (Scheme 31). In contrast, that performed by KAS2, the decarboxylative inversion and condensation proceeds without loss of the C-2 label (Scheme 32). Assuming a stereochemical inversion during both KAS1 and KAS2 condensations, the alternative methyl stereochemistry produced by Mod1 could result from a subsequent rapid epimerisation (prior to KR1 reduction), leading to loss of the label. The KR1 might then select only the inverted C-2 methyl epimer, and reduce its C-3 carbonyl to the desired alcohol. There is no such epimerisation occurring in the second module’s sequence of reactions.

In 1999, Leadlay et al. added the NAC thioester of 2-methyl-3-oxopentanoate 147 to DEBS1/TE and NADPH and obtained a product mixture (4% substrate conversion) containing 90% the expected (2S,3R)-diketide 148 but with a significant level (10%) of the (2R,3S) isomer 149 containing the stereochemistry corresponding to KR2 reduction. 111 No significant levels of the other two diastereoisomers were present (Scheme 33). The authors suggested that this second isomer was actually formed

by KR2 reduction, rather than poor stereofidelity by KR1. This proposal was tested by incubation with the KR2° mutant (aa 3103 to 3278 deleted) of DEBS1/TE, which now resulted solely in the (2S,3R) isomer. Thus KR1 is entirely stereoselective, accepting only the (2S)-isomer of the rapidly epimerising substrate, and reduces it stereospecifically to give only the (2S,3R)-product. The KR1 controls the C-2 stereochemistry indirectly by selecting only a single epimer as substrate, and controls the C-3 stereochemistry directly through stereospecific reduction. Presumably KAS2 can bind to the (2R)-isomer of 147 as it has the right C-2 and C-3 functionality, even though it is a diketide rather than the natural 2-methyl-3-oxo triketide ACP2 thioester substrate.

It is not known whether or not there is any epimerase activity in KAS domains that do not involve epimerisation, rapid reduction of the natural (2R)-2-methyl-3-oxo-triketide by KR2 might occur so fast epimerisation cannot be observed.

In 1998, Cane et al. showed that both KR1 and KR2 of DEBS1/TE uses the 4-pro-(S) hydrogen of NADPH, despite resulting in opposite hydroxy-stereochemical outcomes and are thus ‘B-face enzymes’. This is also the same prochiral hydrogen of NADPH as used by FAS of all organisms reported to date, and further strengthens the evolutionary link. In addition, it suggests that all the PKS KR’s bind NADPH in the same way with an analogous binding site, stereochemistry being defined by how the substrate is presented to the hydride.

In 1998, Khosla et al. investigated the substitution in (DEBS1 + Mod3/TE) of Ery KR2 (which naturally gives (3S)-hydroxy products) by other KR’s from elsewhere in DEBS or obtained from the rapamycin (RAPs) polyketide synthase cluster. Ery KR5 in its normal ‘wild-type’ position also gives (3S)-hydroxy stereochemistry, whilst Rap KR2 gives (3R)-hydroxy products. The stereochemistry of reduction by Rap KR4 is unknown due to subsequent dehydration.

Replacement of Ery KR2 in DEBS1 + Mod3/TE by Ery KR5 led to the formation of tetraketide lactone 150 and lactol 151 (as for the control), showing that Ery KR5 can fully replace Ery KR2 (Scheme 34). Replacement of Ery KR2 by Rap KR2 (actually Rap DH2°/KR2) or replacement of Ery KR2 by Rap KR4 both gave the triketide lactone (2R,3R,4R,5R)-2,4-dimethyl-3-hydroxyheptano-5-lactone 152 as the major product (20mgL⁻¹), which is 3-epimeric to the natural triketide lactone 10 (Scheme 34). The authors concluded that the KR domains control the absolute stereochemistry of the reduction regardless

remains. This must epimerise then selectively bind one methyl epimer for transfer to KAS4. Alternatively, another domain such as KAS3 or KAS4 must select the correct 3-oxo-(2R)-methyl stereoisomer and further process it.

Cane, Khosla *et al.* have analysed the molecular recognition features of individual modules, in particular the influence of C-2 methyl and C-3 hydroxy stereochemistry on processing. They attached TE to the end of Mod2, Mod3, Mod4 and Mod6 (as single modules), and examined the production of triketide products after the addition of all four stereoisomers of the NAC-diketide 3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate. No triketide product was obtained from any module after the addition of either the (2R,3R) or (2S,3S) stereoisomers 27 and 29. Addition of the (2S,3R) isomer 8 (the 'natural' stereochemistry for loading onto Mod2) gave triketide 10 with Mod2/TE, Mod5/TE and Mod6/TE, and the corresponding oxotriketide 15 with the non-reductive module Mod3/TE. Somewhat unexpectedly, the enantiomeric triketide, the (2R,3S)-isomer 25, gave the corresponding triketide lactone 26 with Mod2/TE (Staunton *et al.* reported no turnover of 25 by DEBS1/TE), Mod5/TE and Mod6/TE; and the corresponding oxo-triketide with Mod3/TE. All four modules preferred processing 8 to 25 as substrate ($K_{cat}$: by around 10-fold). The bishomologue, (2R,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylheptanoate NAC thioester was also processed by all four modules to the corresponding hydroxy or oxo-triketide lactones. The authors note that two (enantiomeric) stereoisomers are substrates for all four enzyme systems, and the other two stereoisomers for none. Diketides 8 and 25 have the same relative (syn) configuration at the C-2 and C-3 centres, and the authors suggest there may be sufficient flexibility in the binding pocket to allow binding of the two mirror image conformations. In addition, the substrate preference for all four modules is identical due to evolution from a common ancestral module. Thus, although *in vivo* Mod3 and Mod6 process (2R,3S)-substrates, as the isolated modules they have a strong preference for processing (2S,3R)-substrates, once again emphasising that in megasynthases precise stereochemical recognition is not essential for optimal processing. In a large megasynthase, individual modules do not evolve to maximise their own rate, but to maximise the production of the overall biologically useful metabolite, and may be quite prepared to accept a substrate that is not their optimal substrate.

Reynolds has discussed the evolutionary link between crotonyl CoA reductases and enoylreductases.

### 2.14 Thioesterase (TE or TE1)

The mechanism of a thioesterase is normally two-step; after rapid reversible formation of an initial Michaelis complex, the reaction of a serine hydroxy at the active site with the thioester 154 gives an $O$-acyl-enzyme (via a tetrahedral intermediate 155) $O$-ester 156 (Scheme 36). This is then followed by delivery of a histidine activated water/hydroxide species to give the free acid (157 $\text{Nuc} = \text{OH}$). In the case of macrolactone formation, this second step needs replacing by intramolecular delivery of a distal secondary hydroxy group, with some mechanism to prevent hydrolysis by water. The Ery TE sequence contains a suitable Ser, and a His near the sequence terminus. The Ery TE can efficiently promote the release of the corresponding acyl intermediates as lactones with ring sizes 6,8,12,14 and 16 (vide supra). Recent work has revealed the three-dimensional structure of tetradeconyl ACP TE from *Vibrio harveyii* and mechanistic studies on the chicken FAS suggest that formation

of the tetrahedral intermediate, prior to formation of the $O$-acyl enzyme intermediate, is the rate determining step.

Staunton *et al.* investigated the substrate specificity of the TE by using a truncated version of the DEBS3 protein consisting of the ACP/TE didomain previously overexpressed and studied in *E. coli*, whose ACP serine is not post-translationally modified. The 4-nitrophenolate esters of a wide variety of fatty acids ($C_3$, $C_8$, $C_{12}$ and $C_{15}$) were examined (Scheme 36, replace ACP6-S by 4-nitrophenolate). The propionyl and octanoyl esters were readily hydrolysed but not two longer chain examples, though this may be due to solubility problems. The rate of hydrolysis was being measured by the production of free 4-nitrophenolate; this is not a direct measure of binding affinity to enzyme or complete hydrolysis, only the rate of the formation of $O$-acyl-enzyme intermediate via breakdown of the initial tetrahedral intermediate. The $\omega$-hydroxyoctanoyl, -nonanoyl and -decanoyl esters were all hydrolysed about four times faster than the corresponding fatty acid ester. This could be due to use of the hydroxy group to form a macrolactone, or perhaps due to increased binding, or increased solubility. Reaction of 8-hydroxy-, or 8-oxotetradecanoate was extremely slow, a slight improvement over tetradecanoate with which there is no reaction, possibly due to solubility problems. The reaction with 10-hydroxydecanoyl 4-nitrophenolate was followed by ESMS. The initial ‘protein only’ peak at $M_r$ 38153 Da was quickly replaced by the expected peak for the $O$-acyl enzyme intermediate at 38323, which after 10 min disappeared due to complete hydrolysis. Thus an $O$-acyl enzyme intermediate is formed. Spectral analysis of the products from a large-scale incubation showed the formation of the free acid and twice as much ethyl ester, but absolutely no evidence of macro-lactone formation. The incubation mixture contained about 1% (v/v) ethanol in water to aid solubility, so the TE must have a very strong preference (300-fold) for using EtOH over water in the final deacylation step, and did not use the 10-hydroxy group in deacylation. The authors report similar relative rates for the corresponding NAC thioesters. These observations suggest that the TE has a broad substrate specificity, and that with PNP esters, deacylation is the rate determining step.

In 1998, Staunton *et al.* added, *in vitro*, the 4-nitrophenolate esters of all four stereoisomers of 2-methyl-3-hydroxypentanoate to the purified ACP6/TE overexpressed in *E. coli* (no ACP Pant-SH group). The stereochemistry at C-2 and C-3 of the growing acyl chain presented by the ACP6 to the TE in 6-dEB formation is (2R,3S), as in Scheme 36. In the absence of any ethanol (+1% MeCN for solubility), this (2R,3S) isomer was hydrolysed the slowest of the four stereoisomers, and six times slower than the unfunctionalised pentanoyl ester (Table 3). Presumably the TE is optimised through this C-2/C-3 functional group recognition to retard the wasteful hydrolysis of the diketides, and this retardation process is optimised for the (2R,3S)-stereochemistry.

Table 3 Stereospecificity of Ery TE

| Substrate           | Relative rate |
|--------------------|---------------|
|                    | Aqueous with 1% MeCN | With 1% EtOH |
| (2R,3S)-diketide    | 1.05          | 3.50         |
| (2S,3R)-diketide    | 1.75          | 4.55         |
| (2R,3R)-diketide    | 1.40          | 2.10         |
| (2S,3S)-diketide    | 1.75          | 9.45         |
| Pentanoyl          | 6.90          | 15.10        |

Addition of 1% EtOH to the incubation mixture greatly increased the release of 4-nitrophenolate (PNP) from all precursors, to give ethyl ester products, with the smallest increase for (2R,3R) isomer, and largest for (2S,3S). All substrates were found to efficiently bind to the enzyme by ESMS, with or without ethanol being present. Thus, with these PNP substrates, formation of the O-acyl-enzyme intermediate 156 (with release of PNP) is fast (and not very discriminating) and the deacylation step to give 157 should be rate limiting, and that C-2/C-3 functionality is causing the enzyme to fold around the substrate excluding water, but not ethanol. Addition of substrates such as (2R,3S)-2-methyl-3,16-dihydroxyhexadecanoyl PNP esters were added to the incubation mixture, but as before, there was no evidence of lactone formation.

In 1999, Khosla et al. examined the specificity of just the TE, overexpressed in *E. coli*. The TE was overexpressed as a His₆-tagged fusion protein at 50 mg L⁻¹ levels, and was found to be active and soluble even at high concentrations, eluting as a dimer of ca. 60 kDa. Whilst there are two free thiols, modification does not affect catalytic activity, so presumably these have a non-catalytic function such as anchoring to/interacting with some other part of the DEBS complex. The TE was tested with a range of NAC thioesters at 1 mM concentration, with an enzyme concentration of 13.6 μM. The authors observed a much greater discrimination between stereoisomers at the C-2/C-3 positions than Staunton observed with the corresponding PNP esters, the (2S,3R)-isomer being hydrolysed four-fold more slowly than the enantiomer, whilst Staunton observed less than two-fold difference. When these C-2 and C-3 stereogenic centres are attached to a long chain racemic (ω-1)-hydroxy, a much larger 13-fold difference in hydrolysis is observed, both of which were faster than their corresponding shorter chain analogue with the same C-2/C-3 stereochemistry, showing a preference for the long (ω-1)-hydroxy chain. Kinetic parameters for (2R,3S,13RS)-3,13-dihydroxy-2-methyltetradecanoyl NAC thioester with (2R,3S)-3-hydroxy-2-methylpentanoate NAC thioester in parentheses: \( K_{\text{M}} \) 0.8 (12.2) mM; \( K_{\text{cat}} \) 0.70 (0.44) (min⁻¹) \( K_{\text{cat}} / K_{\text{M}} \) 14.4 (0.6). Examination of available kinetic parameters suggested that chain length primarily affects \( K_{\text{M}} \), the longer chain binding more efficiently with a ten-fold lower \( K_{\text{M}} \), whereas the catalytic ability of the enzyme was relatively unaffected.

These results using just TE and NAC thioesters, in contrast to those of Staunton using ACP6/TE and PNP esters, indicate that under these conditions, the formation of the O-acyl enzyme 156 step is sensitive to the structure and stereochemistry of the substrate, and the hydrolysis/ethanolysis/lactonisation to 157 relatively insensitive to structure. The better leaving group ability of PNP over NAC may be masking stereochemical discrimination in the formation of the O-acyl enzyme—though it should not significantly affect formation of the tetrahedral intermediate 155, but only the rate of its breakdown to the O-acyl enzyme intermediate 156. The formation of the initial tetrahedral complex 155 is presumably reversible to some extent. Thus, the slower the leaving group leaves (NAC vs. PNP), the more time there is for the reverse reaction from 155 back to 154 to compete with formation of the O-acyl intermediate 156, leading to greater discrimination between substrates with different structures. In the case of NAC thioesters, formation of the O-acyl enzyme intermediate at least competes with deacylation to be the rate determining step. When the active site is saturated, the \( K_{\text{cat}} \) now depends on deacylation, which is less affected by substrate structure.

The authors added ‘free’ TE to DEBS1 (no fused TE; DEBS1+TE) to assess its effect on triketide lactone formation. With a twenty-fold excess concentration of TE, the rate of triketide lactone 10 formation was still only 1% that of DEBS1/TE, thus TE does not have any specific non-covalent interaction with the end of Mod2. Previous work (see pikromycin) has suggested that the TE may be able to catalyse lactonisation not only of the attached module, but of the one before, by being located in space at the end of both. When Khosla et al. added DEBS1 (no TE) to module 3 with TE covalently fused onto the end (Mod3/TE), a ten-fold increase in triketide lactone formation over that produced by DEBS1 and ‘free’ TE was obtained (but still ten-fold lower than for DEBS1/TE), suggesting that the TE can indeed ‘loop back’ to act on the product of the previous module. However, more recent studies suggest that a module can pass on the growing acyl chain, ‘skipping’ the elongation and processing.

In the tylosin PKs cluster, there is a second discrete TE, ‘TE2’ whose presence greatly increases antibiotic production. It is thought to act by removing unwanted acyl groups/errors from the tylactone synthase, freeing it up. ORF4 of the Ery gene cluster has been found to have a high sequence similarity, including the GHSXG active site, to the DEBS TE, and may be a discrete TE that removes unwanted acyl groups from DEBS AT’s or ACP’s, unblocking them again for ‘active’ service. The relative size of a discrete TE to DEBS is reminiscent of an egret pecking ticks (unwanted acyl chains) off the back of a water buffalo (DEBS).

### 2.15 Intermodule and interpolyptide linker regions

The low yields obtained from combinations of modules from heterologous PKS systems have been explained as individual modules having considerable recognition and preference for their cognate substrates. However, Khosla et al. have examined the possible influence correct linker regions have on efficient functioning of synthases. The authors first examined the ability of single modules, attached to TE, to convert diketide thioesters into triketide lactones. The test modules were over-expressed in *E. coli* along with the *sfb* phosphopantetheinyl-transferase from *Bacillus subtilis* to post-translationally modify the ACPs. In this system, Mod3/TE or Mod5/TE efficiently converted diketide thioester 8 into the corresponding triketide lactone 10, but Mod2/TE or Mod6/TE could not—even though in their normal bimodular environment, they can. Mod2 and Mod6 are both normally covalently attached to the previous module, whilst Mod3 and Mod5 are not. Khosla et al. examined the role of linker regions between covalently joined modules, such as Mod1 and Mod2, and the ‘interpolyptide’ regions between non-covalently attached modules. The sequences connecting covalently connected modules (‘intermodular linkers’) are shorter, and contain conserved prolines, whilst the N-terminal and C-terminal regions that are between non-covalently attached modules (‘interpolyptide linkers’) are longer and more hydrophobic; the N-terminal ends of all such KAS domains contain a highly conserved PIAI sequence, which the authors used as a restriction site in gene fusion. The DNA encoding the first 18 aa of the dysfunctional Mod2/TE or Mod6/TE were replaced with the DNA encoding the first 39 aa from the functional Mod5/TE; the resulting modules were now able to efficiently convert diketide 8 into triketide lactone 10. The authors then compared the kinetic parameters of these four purified modules in converting the diketide to triketide lactone, and found that the \( K_{\text{M}} \) was similar for all four (ca. 4.5

mM) but that the \(K_{\text{cat}}\) for Mod3/TE was five times lower (150 min⁻¹) than that for the other three modules (750–950 min⁻¹). This may be discrimination by the TE preferring to catalyse the release of the 3-hydroxyacyl ACP thioester product of Mod2/TE or Mod5/TE or Mod6/TE rather than the 3-oxoacyl ACP thioester product of Mod3/TE. Omission of NADPH from the reaction with Mod6/TE (so it now produces the corresponding 3-oxoacyl ACP) had little effect on the \(K_{\text{M}}\), but did reduce the \(K_{\text{cat}}\) from 950 to 450 min⁻¹, confirming the effect of the TE on the apparent rate constant.

The authors then proceeded to link Mod1 with Mod3/TE, Mod5/TE or Mod6/TE in CH999 using the improved linker. Both Mod1/Mod3/TE and Mod1/Mod6/TE produced the triketide 3-oxolactone 15 (15 mg L⁻¹) in similar titres to that 10 is produced by DEBS1/TE. Attachment of RIFS Mod5 (in native environment attaches the same extender unit, with the same stereochemistry, but to a very different growing acyl chain) to DEBS Mod1 to give Mod1/Rif Mod5/TE again yielded the expected triketide lactone 10 again in high yield (15 mg L⁻¹). The TE region at the end of RIFS Mod5 was then replaced with the carboxy terminus interpeptide region of DEBS Mod2. Upon addition of DEBS2 and DEBS3/TE to this 'adjusted' DEBS1 {Ery Mod1/Rif Mod5/(Ery Mod2 carboxyl linker)} gave efficient production of 6-dEB (15 mg L⁻¹) showing that efficient heterologous transfer between non-covalently attached modules can be achieved through judicious selection of interpeptide linker regions.

By appropriately engineering linker regions, the authors have facilitated communication between modules, and they suggest that the correct linker between adjacent modules is very important in determining the efficient transfer of any substrate between those two modules—perhaps more important than the substrate's structure, and are important in determining the correct vectorial communication between domains and modules. This and related work has been reviewed by Gokhale and Khosla,²¹ in which the authors propose that: when an ACP is loaded with its appropriately reduced growing acyl chain, its conformation, and that of the ACP to KAS(+1) linker region, is such that the ACP and KAS(+1) are close in space, facilitating transfer of the growing acyl chain onto the next module KAS(+1). Once this occurs, and the KAS(+1) is 'loaded' the 'empty' ACP and linker region's new conformation changes such that the ACP and KAS(+1) are distant, and the ACP is once again close to its own KAS and reductive loop ready to receive the next growing acyl chain for processing.

A highly conserved proline residue in these linkers may play a role in aligning modules or acting as a hinge. The authors propose that interpeptide linkages are due to interactions between so-called α-helical coiled-coils which are frequently found binding heterodimers. The authors also discuss how selectivity is achieved through a kinetic channelling of intermediates in a steady state, even though in isolation each module and domain is relatively unspecific, retaining evolutionary flexibility.

The domain organisation of DEBS, and other synthases, can be summarised as in Table 4, where a filled box represents the absence of a domain, a tick its presence, an empty square represents a domain that is present, but not functioning, a filled black box represents a domain that has lost part of its sequence/active site and so cannot function, 'A' is an acetate/malonate loading acyl transferase, P is propionate/methyl malonate loading acyl transferase.

### 2.16 Post-PKS

The entire erythromycin-producing gene cluster in *Sac. erythraea* has now been sequenced.⁴⁰,⁴¹,¹²²–¹²⁵ The genes upstream of *eryK* do not seem involved in Ery biosynthesis.¹²⁶ Unusually, there does not appear to be any regulatory genes in the cluster. An outline is presented in Fig. 14. As in all of this review, genes normally referred to by Roman numerals e.g. *eryBVI* are labelled with arabic numerals e.g. *eryB6* for clarity.

#### 2.16.1 Deoxysugar biosynthesis

Deoxysugar biosynthesis can be rate limiting for antibiotic biosynthesis²¹ and the attachment of deoxysugars to aglycones is essential for antibacterial activity. The sequence of many genes involved has recently been reported.¹²²,¹²³,¹²⁵ There has been

much recent progress on understanding the biosynthesis of deoxysugars and aminosugars used in macrolide biosynthesis, and much revision of earlier proposals. The conversion of glucose to these sugars can involve transamination of a carbonyl (for an amino sugar), and deoxygenation at the C-6, C-4, C-3 or C-2 positions, along with epimerisations. Putative

biosynthetic routes are outlined in Scheme 37, though with only the sequence of many sugar biosynthetic proteins available and product analysis from targeted deletions, there remains some uncertainty over their assignment and exact function, and more than one pathway may be operating in any situation. In the scheme, all the sugars are represented as -dTDP or

deoxythymidylates (as thymine only occurs in DNA not RNA, -dTDP is frequently represented in the literature as -TDP).

D-Mycaminose 163, D-desosamine 166, 6-deoxy-D-allose 168 and its 2,3-di-O-methyl product D-mycinose 169; L-oleandrose 176, L-mycarose 173 and its 3-O-methylated derivative L-cladinose 174 all appear to be derived from 4,6-dideoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose 160. Activation of glucose-1-phosphate 158 by D-glucose 1-phosphate thymidyltransferase (dTDP-D-glucose synthetase) gives dTDP-D-glucose 159 is followed by dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase to give the common intermediate 160. No genes coding for the synthetase or 4,6-dehydratase have been located within the Ery cluster. A gene has been located encoding similar protein, *gdh*, however inactivation of *gdh* was lethal implying it is involved in primary metabolism. Hutchinson *et al.* have recently cloned *gdh* from *Sac. erythraea* and expressed it in *E. coli*. However, the gene encoding for this 4,6-dehydratase is found located in other macrolide biosynthetic gene clusters e.g. *tylA2* in the tylosin cluster. The mechanism of 4,6-dehydratases involves C-4 oxidation by NAD⁺, dehydration of C-6 to the double bond, followed by addition of the hydride (the NAD⁺/NADH remains bound to the protein throughout, so the same hydride is intramolecularly delivered back to the molecule) to C-6 with overall inversion of configuration at C-6, as determined by chiral methyl experiments (Scheme 38). The enzyme dTDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase has been purified. A recent paper by Frey uses rapid mix-quench MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to examine single turnover mechanism for the 4,6-dehydratase which allowed observation of the transient intermediate dTDP-hexopyranose-5,6-ene 159b; however, the authors were unable to observe the dTDP-4-deoxy-4-oxo-D-glucose 159a, presumably due to its low concentration (Scheme 38). The pathways to the various sugars now diverge: for some macrolides, the genes necessary to assemble, and transfer a sugar, are clustered closely together. However, in the Ery cluster, genes for the assembly of both sugars are dispersed on either side of the genes for the megasynthase.

**Scheme 38** Mechanism of 6-deoxygenation by dTDP-D-glucose 4,6-dehydratase.

There are still problems being encountered in overexpressing many of these proteins as soluble enzymes involved in desosamine biosynthesis, so the substrate preference and the exact sequence of reactions remains unclear. The pathway to D-desosamine (and D-mycaminose) next involves EryC2 mediated isomerisation of the 3-hydroxy-4-oxo moiety in 160 to the 4-hydroxy-3-oxo moiety found in 6-deoxy-3-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose 161. Whilst in D-mycaminose 163 biosynthesis, TylB catalysed PLP dependent transamination occurs on the 4-hydroxy-3-oxo intermediate 161 to give 162 (Scheme 39), it has recently been shown by Liu *et al.* that in *S. venezuelae* C-4 deoxygenation occurs on 161 before C-3 transamination to give 164, then 165. In the Ery cluster, two enzymes may be PLP dependent, EryCl and EryC4. One is needed to form an imine with 161 to aid C-4 deoxygenation acting as a 3,4-dehydratase (Scheme 40), and one to transaminate 164 to 165, analogous to TylB. If the same path to D-desosamine 166 is followed in

**Scheme 39** Mechanism of C-3 aminotransferase for conversion of 161 into 162.

**Scheme 40** Mechanism of C-4 deoxygenation of 3,6-dideoxy-3-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose (with speculative direct conversion into 165).

*Sac. erythraea* as occurs in *S. venezuelae*, C-4 deoxygenation would be achieved using a PLP dependent EryCl (or EryC4) 3,4-dehydratase followed by a 3,4-reductase EryC5 that together convert 161 into 164. In *S. venezuelae*, there is a separate PLP C-3 aminotransferase (Des5) to transaminate at C-3, and presumably this is achieved in *Sac. erythraea* by either EryCl or EryC4. It is intriguing why nature forms a pyridoxal imine of 161, hydrolyses it to 164, and then reforms the imine to transaminate to 165. An elegant alternative would surely be the direct hydride attack on C-4 of the imine precursor intermediate of 164 followed by hydrolysis to give 165 (dotted line), avoiding the intermediacy of 164. SAM dependent N-methylation by EryC6 gives dTDP-D-desosamine, which is then attached by EryC3 to 3-O-mycarosylerythronolide B 4 to give Ery D 5 (Scheme 4).

Theories on the pathway to L-mycarose 173, L-cladinose 174, and L-oleandrose 176 have undergone revision in recent years. The direct 3,5-epimerisation of 160 to give 170 followed by C-2

**Scheme 41 Mechanism of 'TylX3' and 'TylCl' (usually referred to as TylC6 and TylC2).**

deoxygenation to 171 appears to have been replaced, at least in L-mycarose biosynthesis in S. fradiae¹³² and L-oleandrose in S. antibioticus,¹³³ and presumably will be found to be the case in Sac. erythraea by a dehydration mechanism to achieve C-2 deoxygenation. A Zn²⁺ dependent 2,3-dehydratase (EryB6 and TylC6—referred to as TylX3 by Floss) converts 160 into 177 that was quickly reduced by the NADPH dependent S. fradiae 3-oxoreductase/enoyl reductase (TylCl or EryB2) (Scheme 41). The NADPH hydride attacks the C-3 carbonyl in the 3,4-dicarbonyl tautomer of 177, rather than the C-2 position in a Michael-like attack (Scheme 41) to give 179 or 180. Floss et al. obtain the product of the 3-oxoreductase in S. antibioticus as the equatorial alcohol 180, whilst Liu et al. obtain the product of the 3-oxoreductase in S. fradiae as the axial alcohol 179. As the reported spectra are different, especially with the H-3 dd coupling constants (12.4 and 4.9 Hz in 180 vs. 3.0 and 3.5 Hz in 179), it appears that this reduction occurs with two different stereochemistries in the two different organisms.

For L-oleandrose biosynthesis: 3,5-epimerisation of 180 followed by NADPH reduction would give L-olivose 175, and SAM methylation L-oleandrose 176. However, speculation leads to an elegant alternative: Floss et al. showed that

---

4,6-dideoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose 160 was transformed by a 2,3-dehydratase to the 3,4-dioxo species 177, and then a 3β-oxoreductase (also referred to as an enoylreductase) converts 177 into 180.¹³³ The authors proposed a 3,5-epimerisation and 4-oxoreduction pathway to dTDP-L-olivose 175. However, there may no longer remain any precedent for a 3,5-epimerisation in the biosynthesis of these macrolide sugars. As the authors point out, this gene for the 3-oxoreduction, S. antibioticus Tu99 orf10, was originally proposed to be part of the cluster that assembled dTDP-D-olivose 181 for chlorothricin. It seems that far fewer steps would be required to convert 180 into D-olivose 181 (one step, a 4-oxoreductase) than into L-olivose 175 (at least two steps), so that perhaps this gene is after all part of the assembly of D-olivose, and that a separate, as yet unlocated, gene in S. antibioticus encodes the 3α-oxoreductase analogous to eryB2 and tylC2 that forms 179. Conversion into 171 by a 5-epimerase (analogous to EryB7 and TylC7), followed by 4β-oxoreduction would give dTDP-L-olivose 175 directly, avoiding the need for a 3,5-epimerase! These alternatives are illustrated in Scheme 37.

For L-cladinose biosynthesis: a 5-epimerase (EryB7) of isomer 179 gives 171—which presumably occurs mainly as its tautomer. Ironically, in the biosynthesis of L-mycarose, the stereochemistry of the C-3 hydroxy group in 171 is irrelevant, as the Ery B3 SAM dependent methylation presumably takes place via the 3-ene-3,4-diol to give 172, which is reduced by the NADPH dependent EryB4 to dTDP-L-mycarose, which is attached to erythronolide B by EryB5, and after attachment of the second sugar, and C-12 hydroxylation to EryC, the mycarosyl portion is O-methylated by the SAM dependent EryG to give L-cladinose as part of EryA.

### 2.16.2 Ery gene cluster

A putative assignment of the genes in the Ery cluster are given below (see also Table 5). Some of these assignments are based upon recent work in related systems such as tylosin and oleandomycin,¹³²,¹³³ and remain to be clarified. More than a single pathway may be operating, and a single enzyme may be able to participate in more than one step in separate alternative pathways.

ORF1: EryC1 PLP dependent 3-aminotransferase in D-desosamine biosynthesis, involved in converting 164 to 165 or PLP dependent 3,4-dehydratase involved in converting 161 to 164. A recent paper by Liu et al. on desosamine biosynthesis

in methymycin biosynthesis suggests that C-4 deoxygenation precedes C-3 transamination. ${ }^{131}$

ErmE: resistance protein, involved in SAM dependent methylation of ribosomes, preventing binding by EryA.

ORF2: erroneously labelled EryB1, better referred to as 'ORF2'. Sequence similar to β-glucosidases (sub family 3'). ${ }^{124}$ Mutants produce EryA but as previously reported as EryB1 ${ }^{134}$ this is retained. One possible function of this protein is that it may act as an extracellular glucosidase (similar to that found activating glycosyl oleandomycin) but no inactivated glyco-sylated form of EryA has yet been found, so actual function remains obscure and speculative.

ORF3: EryB3 sequence has C-methyl transferase GxGxG cofactor binding consensus sequence. Previously labelled EryH as early mutants were found to accumulate 6-dEB, blocked in either synthesis or attachment of the mycarose moiety. However, a mutant in ORF3 in which a single cysteine residue has been changed to serine accumulates erythronolide B, thus previous mutations in $orf3$ were having a ‘polar’ effect on $eryF$, inhibiting its expression, resulting in accumulation of 6-dEB. This ORF3C13S mutant also produced small quantities of bioactive macrolide identified as 3′-C-demethyl EryA, thus ORF3 is a C-methyl transferase in dTDP-L-mycarose biosynthesis, possibly converting 171 to 172. ${ }^{124}$ This is in conflict with proposals by Summers that EryB1 is this C-methyl transferase. ${ }^{125}$ A detailed paper on the closely related enzyme TylC3 has just appeared that has 68% identity with EryB3. ${ }^{125b}$

ORF4: EryF. Cytochrome P-450. Catalyses the C-6 hydroxylation of 6-dEB1 to erythronolide B3. Sequence has an alanine where the camphor P-450 has a conserved threonine-252 thought to be essential in dioxygen binding and cleavage. ${ }^{135,136}$ A preliminary crystallographic analysis has been published. ${ }^{137}$ Targeted gene disruption resulted in formation of 6-deoxy-EryA as enzymes normally using erythronolide B derived substrates have accepted 6-dEB analogues. ${ }^{39}$ The substrate specificity of EryF with 6-dEB analogues has been examined, with only the analogues with the C-9 carbonyl reduced to either alcohol (9R at 100%; 9S at 50% rate of 6-dEB) or 8,18a-deoxyoleandrolide being processed. ${ }^{138}$

ORF5: EryH. Sequence has similarity with acyltransferases and thioesterases, with a GHSxG active site similar to that found in DEBS. ${ }^{41}$ Maybe a discrete TE (TE2) that hydrolyses mistakes off the DEBS proteins such as misacylated AT’s, to restore them to activity.

ORF6: EryG SAM dependent O-methyl transferase that will act upon either EryD or EryC. ${ }^{38,41}$ The sequence has a glycine rich DxGxGxG segment near the N-terminus in common with ErmE. Paulus et al. have overexpressed EryG in $E$. coli and shown that EryG will O-methylate EryD at half the rate it O-methylates EryC. ${ }^{38}$

ORF7: EryB2 has sequence homology to several oxidoreductases. Mass spectral analysis of eryB2 mutants suggests the presence of an unsaturated sugar, implicating EryB2 as a sugar enoylreductase responsible for reduction of the 2,3-double bond after 2,3-dehydration in the biosynthesis of dTDP-L-mycarose. Assigned to reduce 177 to 179.

ORF8: EryC3 sequence similar to ORF14 EryB5 and other glycosyltransferases, transfers desosamine to aglycone.

ORF9: EryC2 deduced sequence is very similar to cytochrome P-450 hydroxylases, but it lacks the vital cysteine residue which provides the axial ligand for the heme. Leadlay et al. postulate that a role for this protein could be the isomerisation of dTDP-4,6-dideoxy-4-oxoglucose 160 to dTDP-3,6-dideoxy-3-oxoglucose 161, but the sequence provides no clues as to the mechanism for this transformation. ${ }^{123}$

ORF13: EryB4 deduced sequence is characteristic of NAD + dependent oxoreductases, and is homologous with DnvR ($S$. peucetius). Mutation results in accumulation of erythronolide B but also small quantities of several species, each with $M_{r}$ two units higher than Ery A,B,C and D, suggesting that the unreduced oxo-sugar can act (poorly) as a substrate for mycarosyltransferase, and thus EryB4 is 4-deoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-L-mycarose reductase, reducing 172 to 173.

ORF14: EryB5; erythronolide B 3-O-(dTDP-L-mycarosyl)-transferase. MS analysis of eryB5 mutant extracts indicates, in addition to erythronolide B, formation of small amounts of desosaminyl erythronolide B, indicating that in the absence of EryB5, the desosaminyl transferase can accept Ery B as a (poor) substrate.

ORF15: EryC6; $N,N$-methyltransferase: SAM dependent methyl transferase thought to be the $N,N$-dimethylation of 165 to form dTDP-D-desosamine 166. ORF15 previously suggested to be C-methyl transferase converting 171 into 172. ${ }^{21}$

ORF16: EryB6 sequence very similar to those found for daunosamine biosynthesis, proposed that EryB6 is the Zn${}^{2+}$ dependent 2,3-dehydratase converting 160 to 177, that after double bond reduction by EryB2 results in overall C-2 deoxygenation. A minor component of the mutant fermentation is thought to be desosaminyl-erythronolide B.

ORF17: EryC4 has sequence similarity to EryCl and pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) dependent enzymes. ${ }^{122}$ Mutation not only results in 3-$O$-$\alpha$-mycarosyl erythronolide B4, but small quantities of 4′-hydroxydesosaminylerythromycin B, with an extra 4-hydroxylation on the desosamine sugar (i.e. mycaminose), thus EryC4 could be a PLP dependent dehydratase, and Leadlay proposes that EryC4 and EryC5 are both involved in deoxygenation at C-4 of desosamine, instead of EryC2 as recently suggested. ${ }^{139}$ An alternative explanation for the formation of some 4″-hydroxydesosaminylerythromycin B could be that in the absence of its normal preferred 4-deoxy substrate 164, EryC4 can transaminate 161 to give 162, i.e. acting identically to TylB in D-mycaminose synthesis. In Scheme 37 EryC4 is also shown as the 3-aminotransferase, as recent work has suggested EryC1 along with EryC5 achieve the C-4 deoxygenase, and EryC2 is the 3-hydroxy-4-oxo isomerase. Final clarification awaits purification and characterisation of all the proteins in this sequence.

ORF18: EryC5 probably the NADPH dependent 3,4-reductase involved in the C-4 deoxygenation of 3,6-dideoxy-3-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose, after imine formation with PLP and 3,4-dehydration (Scheme 40).

ORF19: EryB7 has sequence similarity to deoxyhexose-3,5-epimerases and has been referred to as 4,6-dideoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose 3,5-epimerase. ${ }^{122}$ However, recent work shows that in the Tyl L-mycarose biosynthetic system 160 C-2 deoxygenation is achieved by a dehydration pathway, so the alternative suggestion by Summers who proposed that EryB7 is a 5-epimerase converting 179 into 171 is illustrated. ${ }^{125}$ Mutation results in erythronolide B.

In a recent paper, Kim et al. have overexpressed EryB7 in $E$. coli and added the crude enzyme preparation to TDP-6-deoxy-L-threo-D-glycero-4-hexulose produced in vivo. ${ }^{140}$ GC-MS analysis of the peracetylated NaBH${}_{4}$ reduced product showed that EryB7 has epimerised 4,6-dideoxy-4-oxo-dTDP-D-glucose. As only one epimerised product was obtained, the authors suggest that EryB7 is a 5-epimerase. If 160 is indeed the natural substrate of EryB7, Scheme 37 needs adjustment! The Ery D-mycarose pathway might be different to the Tyl D-mycarose pathway: For example, the C-2 deoxygenation could occur on 160 in the Tyl system, but on 170 in the Ery pathway.

ORF20: EryK. P-450 hydroxylation of C-12. Has been (erroneously?) considered as both a EryD and an EryBC-12 hydroxylase as mutation led to the accumulation of both EryB and EryD. Cloned by Stassi et al., ${ }^{136}$ overproduced (as insoluble inclusion body) and characterised by Cane and Lambalot. ${ }^{141}$ After resolubilising and reconstituting with heme cofactor, the protein showed over 1200-fold preference for EryD over EryB as a substrate, showing that EryB is a primary

**Scheme 42** Biosynthesis of megalomycin in *Micromonospora megalomicea* and relationship with erythromycin biosynthesis.

shunt metabolite in Ery A biosynthesis. Ery D was found to bind to EryK 20-times more tightly than Ery B, which was more loosely bound than the product Ery C. It is notable that methylation of a distal sugar hydroxy group (Ery D vs. Ery B) has such a dramatic effect upon binding.

Vanden Boom *et al.* have determined the transcriptional organisation of the erythromycin gene cluster, *eryA1* through *eryG* is co-transcribed; as are *eryB4* through *eryB7*; and *eryB3* and *eryF*. Promoter regions (consensus of TTGACA 35 bp before and TATAAT ten bp before gene) are located between *eryCl* and *eryE*; *eryBl* and *eryB3*; *eryAl* and *eryB4*; *eryC4* and *eryB6*; and start of *eryK*, as represented by black dots in Table 5.

Parsons *et al.* have isolated 13-cyclopentyl-13-deethyl-erythromycin B from a recombinant strain of *Sac. erythraea*, i.e. with a cyclopentyl containing starter unit.

Mikami *et al.* have shown that erythromycins are produced by the *Nocardia.*

Sasaki *et al.* have found that a polyether (carriomycin) producing strain of *S. hygroscopicus* ATCC 11891 glycosylated erythromycin A to inactive glucosylated derivatives.

Megalomicin A (Meg A) 181a, a potent antiparasitic agent, is produced by *Micromonospora megalomicea* and has the same structure as erythromycin C except for the attachment of megosamine to the C-6 hydroxy group (Scheme 42).

Presumably the potent antiparasitic activity, including antimalarial activity, is connected with the presence of megosamine on C-6. McDaniel *et al.* have cloned and sequenced 48 kbp which includes the PKS and megosamine 177c (Scheme 37) biosynthetic genes. The stereostructure of megosamine provided in this paper is incorrect. There was a high degree of similarity not only between MEGS and DEBS, but of the whole cluster apart from a series of genes assigned to megosamine biosynthesis and attachment. Heterologous expression of the PKS in *S. lividans* gave 6-dEB, and expression of the megosamine fragment in *Sac. erythraea* resulted in the formation of megalomicin—this will allow genetic manipulation to form new products in a better understood host than the Micromonospora. The sequence of genes so far sequenced, with Ery analogue or possible function (all MegD's involved in megosame biosynthesis/attachment) is: MegF (EryF) H (EryH; TE2) B2 (EryB2) C3 (EryC3) C2 (EryC2) A3 (EryA3) A2 (EryA2) A1 (EryA1) B4 (EryB4) B5 (EryB5) D7 (2,3-reductase?), D5 (4-oxoreductase) D4 (5-epimerase or 3,5-epimerase) D3 (*N,N*-dimethyltransferase) D2 Y (*O*-acyltransferase) D1 (dTDP-L-megosaminyl transferase) D6 (3,4-isomerase?) and megT (EryB6; 2,3-dehydratase).

A related paper on deoxysugar (L-rhodinose and D-olivose) biosynthesis has recently appeared.
