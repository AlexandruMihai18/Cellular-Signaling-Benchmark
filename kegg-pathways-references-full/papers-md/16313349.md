Summary: Interferons (IFNs) play crucial roles in the regulation of a  
wide variety of innate and adaptive immune responses. Type I interferons  
(IFN-$\alpha$/$\beta$) are central to the host defense against pathogens such as  
viruses, whereas type II interferon (IFN-$\gamma$) mainly contributes to the T-  
cell-mediated regulation of the immune responses. Studies of bone  
destruction associated with rheumatoid arthritis have highlighted the  
importance of the interaction between the immune and skeletal systems.  
Recently, a new research area, termed osteoimmunology, has been  
spawned by a series of studies focusing on the signaling networks  
between IFN and other cytokines in bone metabolisms. It has been  
revealed that IFN-$\gamma$ interferes with the osteoclast differentiation induced  
by receptor activator of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B ligand (RANKL), and this  
mechanism is critical for the suppression of pathological bone resorption  
associated with inflammation. In addition, RANKL induces the IFN-$\beta$  
gene in osteoclast precursor cells, and this induction constitutes a critical  
aspect of the negative feedback regulation mechanisms of RANKL signal-  
ing to suppress excessive osteoclastogenesis. Furthermore, a novel func-  
tion of signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1), the  
essential transcription factor for both type I and type II IFN responses,  
was revealed in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation. Collectively,  
these studies unveil novel aspects of the IFN system and indicate the  
operation of the intricate signaling network among IFN and other cyto-  
kine systems in bone remodeling, which might offer a molecular basis  
for the treatment of bone diseases.  

Introduction  
Homeostasis of the vertebrate skeletal system depends on a  
dynamic balance of bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-  
resorbing osteoclasts (1). This balance must be tightly con-  
trolled by various regulatory systems. Excessive activity of  
osteoclasts leads to pathological bone resorption, as seen in a  
variety of osteopenic diseases such as autoimmune arthritis,  
periodontitis, postmenopausal osteoporosis, Paget's disease,  
and bone tumors (2, 3). Impaired activity of osteoclasts or  
tipping the balance in favor of osteoblasts also results in  
conditions such as osteosclerosis and osteopetrosis (4).  
Therefore, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms of

both cell types is critical for an understanding of the health and disease of the skeletal system.

The endocrine system has been thought to be the major system that controls the calcified tissue metabolism. However, nowadays increased attention is being paid to other regulatory systems. For example, immune and skeletal systems have a variety of regulatory molecules, such as cytokines, in common. Furthermore, immune cells are formed in the bone marrow, interacting with bone cells. Consequently, the physiology and pathology of one system may very well affect the other. Thus, the crosstalk between the immune and skeletal systems and the interdisciplinary field called osteoimmunology have attracted much attention in recent years (5–8). Interferons (IFNs) have been among the essential regulators of the immune responses, but here we focus on the recent progress that has shed light on their importance in the context of osteoimmunology.

### The role of RANKL in arthritic bone destruction

Receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-κB ligand (RANKL) is a tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-family cytokine essential for the induction of osteoclastogenesis (9, 10). RANKL was cloned as an activator of dendritic cells (DCs) expressed by activated T cells, suggesting that this molecule is important in both the skeletal and immune systems (11, 12). In fact, the targeted disruption of RANKL results in defective formation of the lymph nodes and lymphocyte differentiation as well as osteopetrosis, a sclerotic bone disease caused by impaired osteoclastic bone resorption (13). Thus, this molecule explicitly emphasized the close relationship between immune and bone systems (14).

RANKL binds to its receptor RANK and stimulates the osteoclastogenic signals in the monocyte/macrophage lineage (Fig. 1). To summarize how RANKL signals the cell briefly, the binding of RANKL to its receptor RANK results in the recruitment of TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF)-family proteins such as TRAF6, which activates NF-κB and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathways (8, 15). By a yet unknown mechanism, RANKL also induces c-Fos expression. The essential role of these TRAF6 and c-Fos pathways in osteoclastogenesis has been well documented by gene-disruption studies (16–18). In addition to these pathways, calcium signaling activated by RANKL and its costimulatory receptors is also indispensable for the induction of the key transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) c1 (19, 20). To maintain normal bone homeostasis, this RANKL signaling needs to be properly regulated. In this context, osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble ‘decoy’ receptor for RANKL, is known as a negative regulator of osteoclastogenesis (21). In fact, mice lacking OPG develop osteoporosis, pointing to the notion that the balance between RANKL and OPG dictates the levels of bone resorption in vivo (22). Given the importance of RANKL signaling, we can naturally expect additional regulatory factors to be operative in counterbalancing the excessive RANKL action. Indeed, the immune system provides more powerful tools such as IFNs to regulate RANKL signals, as discussed later in this review.

Prolonged or aberrant activation of the immune system under certain autoimmune conditions often results in tissue destruction mediated by effector cells. However, the molecular link between abnormal immune responses and bone damage has long been a mystery in autoimmune arthritis. Although there had already been circumstantial evidence that the osteoclasts generated from synoviocytes play a critical role (23), it was not until RANKL was cloned and found to be overexpressed in arthritic joints that researchers widely accepted that osteoclasts indeed play a critical role in arthritic

**Fig. 1. Essential pathways in RANKL-mediated osteoclast differentiation.** The binding of RANKL to its receptor, RANK, results in the recruitment and trimerization of TRAF6, leading to the activation of various downstream molecules such as NF-κB and JNK. RANKL also induces c-Fos and upregulates the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1). NFATc1 induction is dependent on c-Fos and TRAF6. Furthermore, RANKL evokes calcium oscillation, leading to the calcineurin-mediated activation of NFATc1. The phosphorylation of immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) in DAP12 or FcRγ stimulated by immunoreceptors and RANKL-RANK interaction results in the recruitment of Syk family kinases, leading to the activation of phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) and calcium signaling, which is critical for NFATc1 induction. Immunoreceptors associated with FcRγ include osteoclast-associated receptor (OSCAR) and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor A (PIR-A), and those associated with DAP12 include triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells (TREM-2) and signal-regulatory protein β1 (SIRPβ1).
bone destruction (24, 25). The evidence for the importance of osteoclasts in the pathogenesis of arthritic bone destruction is partly obtained from the beneficial results of osteoclast-targeted therapy in animal model of arthritis (26, 27). Finally, recent studies have provided genetic evidence that RANKL as well as osteoclasts are central in the inflammatory destruction of bone; bone destruction is not observed in osteoclast-deficient mice even if severe inflammation is induced (28, 29). As RANKL has been known to be expressed by activated T cells, it has been proposed that T-cell expression of RANKL may play a critical role in arthritis (26, 30), but it remained unclear whether T cells are the exclusive RANKL-expressing cells in arthritis or whether activated T cells are always osteoclastogenic.

### T-cell-produced IFN-γ in the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis

To examine how activated T cells contribute to the regulation of osteoclastogenesis, we used a well-established model of endotoxin-induced bone resorption, in which the essential involvement of T cells has been documented (31, 32). Interestingly, a notable exacerbation of osteoclast formation and bone destruction was observed in mice lacking one of the IFNGR components, IFNGR1 (IFN-γR⁻/⁻ mice) (33). This observation is also consistent with an enhanced severity in the T-cell-mediated collagen-induced model of autoimmune arthritis observed in IFN-γR⁻/⁻ mice (34, 35). When the effect of IFN-γ-producing T cells on osteoclastogenesis was examined by the in vitro system, osteoclast formation from RANKL-stimulated bone marrow-derived monocyte/macrophage precursor cells (BMMs) was strongly inhibited by the coculture with T cells activated with the anti-CD3 antibody but not with resting T cells (33). When activated T cells were cocultured with IFN-γR⁻/⁻ BMMs, however, the inhibitory effect of activated T cells was completely abrogated. These IFN-γR⁻/⁻ BMMs differentiated into osteoclasts, albeit with low efficiency, when cocultured with activated T cells even in the absence of recombinant RANKL, suggesting that the effect of T cells on osteoclastogenesis depends on the balance between RANKL and IFN-γ. Activated T-cell supernatant also suppressed osteoclastogenesis induced by recombinant RANKL, and this suppressive activity was inhibited by a neutralizing antibody against IFN-γ. These results collectively indicate that IFN-γ is critical for T-cell suppression of RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Thus, activated T cells not only positively regulate but also negatively affect osteoclastogenesis. Rather, it is more appropriate to say that T cells

are anti-osteclastogenic when they produce a detectable amount of IFN-γ.

### Mechanism of IFN-γ action on RANKL signaling

As described above, a marked inhibitory effect of IFN-γ was observed by an in vitro assay for osteoclast formation in RANKL-stimulated BMMs, and a very low level of IFN-γ strongly inhibited osteoclast formation even in the presence of an excess amount of RANKL. How does IFN-γ exert its powerful effect on osteoclastogenesis? IFN-γ signals the cell through activation of the transcription factor signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1 36) (Fig. 2). The active form of Stat1, termed IFN-γ activated factor (GAF), induces target genes of IFN-γ either directly or through the induction of the transcription factor IFN regulatory factor-1 (IRF-1 37). The inhibitory effect of IFN-γ on osteoclastogenesis was completely abrogated in Stat1⁻/⁻ mice, but not in IRF-1⁻/⁻ mice. Thus, the Stat1 (GAF)-mediated, IRF-1-independent gene

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

**Fig. 2. Intracellular signaling cascades activated by IFN-α/β and IFN-γ.** The binding of IFN-α/β to its receptor complex induces the activation of Jak family tyrosine kinases, Jak1 and Tyk2, resulting in the phosphorylation of Stat1 and Stat2. This activation leads to the formation of a heterotrimeric complex, ISGF3, consisting of Stat1, Stat2, and IRF-9 and AAF (or GAF, Stat1 homodimer). IFN-γ activates Jak1 and Jak2, which phosphorylates Stat1 and mainly induces GAF. Although AAF (or GAF) is also activated by IFN-α/β, the typical pathways are depicted in the schematic. ISGF3 and GAF bind to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) and IFN-γ activation site (GAS) on the promoter of IFN-inducible genes, respectively.

induction pathway is critical for interfering with the RANKL signaling pathway.

To investigate the target of IFN-γ inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, RANKL-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK was examined in IFN-γ-treated BMMs. It was found that RANKL-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK was markedly inhibited in IFN-γ-treated BMMs, which was accompanied with the strong suppression of TRAF6 expression. Notably, overexpression of TRAF6 in BMMs by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer rendered them resistant to IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis. In these cells, RANKL-induced activation of NF-κB and JNK was also restored, indicating further that TRAF6 is the critical target of the IFN-γ action. Thus, downregulation of TRAF6 expression accounts, at least in part, for the IFN-γ inhibition of osteoclastogenesis.

The mechanism by which TRAF6 expression is downregulated by IFN-γ was investigated further. It was found that TRAF6 protein levels, rather than its mRNA levels, were suppressed after RANKL stimulation in the presence of IFN-γ. Interestingly, stimulation by RANKL per se promoted TRAF6 degradation, which was markedly accelerated by IFN-γ. As the TRAF6 level is upregulated during stimulation by RANKL, the equilibrium of TRAF6 protein is apparently shifted toward its synthesis rather than its degradation in the absence of IFN-γ, but the addition of IFN-γ reverses the equilibrium. Notably, IFN-γ alone had no effect on TRAF6 expression, suggesting that accelerated TRAF6 degradation by IFN-γ requires RANKL signaling. Further studies revealed that TRAF6 is a direct target for the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is enhanced by IFN-γ (Fig. 3).

Potential role of RANKL and IFN-γ signaling systems in arthritis

It has been suggested that activated T cells promote osteoclastogenesis through RANKL expression and regulate bone loss in autoimmune arthritis (26). But, the results presented above have revealed that activated T cells can also negatively affect osteoclastogenesis through IFN-γ production. It is likely that the balance between RANKL and IFN-γ action may regulate osteoclast formation. For example, during acute immune reactions, an enhanced production of IFN-γ counterbalances the augmentation of RANKL expression and reduces aberrant osteoclast formation. It is worth noting that T cells have anti-osteoclastogenic effect in most of the physiological conditions, given the very strong inhibitory effect of IFN-γ.

The question thus arises, as to how anti-osteoclastogenic T cells have a positive effect on osteoclastogenesis under pathological conditions? T cells must possess a specific pathological mechanism to suppress IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, which is normally dominant in the effect of activated T cells. This mechanism would explain as to why abnormal bone resorption is observed only in pathological conditions such as arthritis but not in normal immune responses.

A possible mechanistic scheme of the bone destruction initiated by T cells in arthritis is summarized in Fig. 4. RANKL is abundantly expressed in synovial fibroblasts stimulated with inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1 (IL-1)

![Diagram](attachment:diagram.png)

Fig. 4. Mechanism of arthritic bone destruction. The left rectangle represents the bone, and the right triangle symbolizes the invading synovium. Activated T cells stimulate the synovial macrophages to secrete proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α and IL-1, which strongly induce RANKL in synovial fibroblasts. In addition, T cells express RANKL themselves, but the contribution of RANKL on T cells remains controversial. There is a very low level of IFN-γ, which is a major T-cell cytokine that inhibits osteoclastogenesis. This imbalance is responsible for the aberrant activation of osteoclast formation in arthritis.

Fig. 3. Crosstalk between RANKL and IFN signaling in osteoclast differentiation. In the inflammatory condition, IFN-γ produced by activated T cells inhibits RANKL signaling by the downregulation of TRAF6 expression. IFN-β, which is induced by RANKL, is an important physiological regulator of RANKL signaling by inhibiting the expression of c-Fos. In addition, osteoprotegerin (OPG) is a well-known inhibitor of RANKL, acting as a decoy receptor.
or TNF-$\alpha$ in addition to RANKL in T cells (3, 25). Interestingly, despite the significant T-cell infiltration observed in arthritic joints, IFN-$\gamma$ expression in these T cells is suppressed (38, 39). Therefore, the paucity of IFN-$\gamma$ and the enhanced expression of RANKL may underlie the activation of osteoclastogenesis in arthritis. It is currently unknown as to why the T cells, which have infiltrated into rheumatoid synovium, have such 'frustrated features', i.e., an expression of surface markers for memory T cells, a low production of IFN-$\gamma$ or IL-2, and hyporesponsiveness to in vitro restimulation (39). It is likely that synovial cells of mesenchymal origin are a major source of RANKL in arthritic joints and that the RANKL expressed in T cells may have relatively limited contribution.

### Contribution of T cells and T-cell-derived cytokines to pathological osteoclastogenesis

Bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis is initially triggered by the activation and infiltration of T cells, which eventually enhance the expression of RANKL in synoviocytes as well as in T cells themselves. T cells may play an important role not only as an initial trigger but also a constant stimulator of bone destruction, mainly by inducing inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-$\alpha$, IL-1) and RANKL in synovial fibroblasts. Although RANKL is expressed in T cells, T cells also produce inhibitors of RANKL such as IFN-$\gamma$ and IL-4. Thus, the direct effect of T cells on osteoclastogenesis depends on a dynamic balance among the cytokines they produce. It is tenable that even if RANKL is expressed on T cells, IFN-$\gamma$ and other cytokines inhibit RANKL signaling, impeding T cells from participating in the direct positive control of osteoclastogenesis. Moreover, the distribution of T cells in the synovium is not always adjacent to bone destruction sites, where osteoclasts are abundant, lending further support to the notion that T cells mainly act on osteoclastogenesis in an indirect manner.

It is also clearly important to determine the differential effect of the local cytokine production pattern regulated by the differentiation status of T cells into T-helper cell (Th) 1 or Th2 type. Although rheumatoid arthritis is sometimes called a Th1 disease, the Th1 subtype is characterized by a robust production of IFN-$\gamma$ and is thus unlikely to be responsible for the enhanced osteoclastogenesis in arthritis. To understand this discrepancy, further studies are necessary; we have recently identified a special Th subset producing osteoclastogenic cytokines (SK and HT, unpublished observation), which might explain how T cells positively contribute to osteoclastogenesis in arthritis.

Are T cells absolutely required for osteoclastogenesis in rheumatoid arthritis? Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced bone destruction or collagen-induced arthritis can be induced in mice lacking T cells (40, 41). Therefore, T-cell-mediated reactions are not essential for osteoclastogenesis, at least in some models of inflammatory bone destruction. Although the evidence for the considerable contribution of T cells to the exacerbation of bone destruction in rheumatoid arthritis must be admitted, it is likely that the enhanced expression of RANKL in synoviocytes induced by synovial inflammation may still be part of the critical molecular basis for osteoclastogenesis in arthritis. The activation of T cells should be understood to be one of the causes initiating this inflammation, but the direct effect of RANKL expressed on T cells appears to have relatively low influence on osteoclastogenesis in vivo. Needless to say, further studies are necessary to determine exactly how T cells contribute to osteoclastogenesis in various disease conditions including rheumatoid arthritis.

Although it is well documented that IFN-$\gamma$ has a bone-protective effect in antigen-specific autoimmune arthritis (34, 35), recent studies suggest that IFN-$\gamma$ may have a causal role in the bone loss associated with estrogen deficiency (42, 43). Pacifici et al. (42) propose that IFN-$\gamma$ activates antigen presentation through class II transactivator (CIITA) induction, leading to the accumulation of a TNF-$\alpha$-producing T-cell population, but there is little evidence that estrogen deficiency results in the activation of antigen-specific immune reactions. It is an interesting hypothesis that T-cell immunity is also involved in the pathogenesis of postmenopausal osteoporosis, but careful interpretation is still needed at this point. The antigens that activate T cells in estrogen deficiency are unknown, and the specific mechanism by which enhanced antigen presentation leads to the generation of osteoclastogenic T-cell population is not well understood (44).

### The IFN-$\alpha/\beta$ system and bone metabolism: a brief introduction

Biological systems have acquired adaptability and robustness against rapid environmental changes, and one typical example is the immune system, which eradicates invading pathogens such as viruses. Type I interferons, i.e., IFN-$\alpha$ and IFN-$\beta$, the production of which is induced upon viral infection, are essential components of this system (45, 46). Production is induced en masse in many types of cells upon infection by a variety of viruses, and this induction is primarily controlled at the transcriptional level. In addition to eliciting strong antiviral activities in target cells, IFN-$\alpha/\beta$ activates effector cells of

genes, and the sequence of IFN-α/β-mediated events is essen-
tial for the maturation of DCs and induction of cytotoxic CD8⁺
T cells. In this regard, IFN-α/β is considered as a critical
cytokine for linking between innate and adaptive immunities
(51).

Given their essential function as mediators of innate immune
responses against viruses, it is interesting that there are many
reports on IFN-α/β production occurring in the absence of
viral infection, albeit at very low levels both in vitro and in vivo
(45, 52, 53). A weak IFN-α/β signal, transmitted indepen-
dently of viral infection, is critical for priming cells to enhance
their response to other stimuli. In addition, a low-level induc-
tion of IFN-α/β in the skeletal system, which occurs in the
absence of viral infection, is also critical for the physiological
regulation of the bone resorption (5, 54, 55). Before going
into the details of its function in bone metabolism, it will be
informative to describe the overview of the IFN-α/β system in
the immune system and its gene-regulatory mechanism.

Intracellular signaling cascades activated by type I IFNs
Type I IFNs are produced by a variety of cells in response to
viral infections. The type I IFNs comprise a number of species
of IFN-α and one IFN-β. All IFN-α/β species interact with the
same receptor complex, termed the IFN-α/β receptor
(IFNAR), which consists of at least two subunits, IFNAR1
and IFNAR2 (Fig. 2). The intracellular domains of these two
subunits, IFNAR1 and IFNAR2, are associated with Janus
kinase protein tyrosine kinases (Jak PTKs), Tyk2 and Jak1,
respectively. Binding of IFN-α/β to IFNAR results in cross-
activation of these Jak PTKs, which then phosphorylate their
downstream substrates, two members of the family of Stats,
namely, Stat1 and Stat2 (36, 56–58). The tyrosine phosphor-
ylation of these Stats leads to the formation of two transcrip-
tional activator complexes, IFN-α-activated factor (AAF) and
IFN-stimulated gene factor 3 (ISGF3) (Fig. 2). AAF is a homo-
dimer of tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat1 [which is identical to
IFN-γ-activated factor (GAF) and therefore depicted as GAF in
Fig. 2], whereas ISGF3 is a heterotrimeric complex of tyrosine-
Transcriptional regulation of IFN-α/β gene induction in
viral infection

The mechanism for the induction of IFN-α/β gene transcrip-
tion in virus-infected cells has been extensively studied (37).
Although the induction mechanism in the immune system is
out of the scope of this review, the mechanism should be
briefly summarized, as this information will help explain the
induction mechanism of RANKL. The promoter region of the
IFN-β gene contains at least four regulatory cis-elements: the
positive regulatory domains (PRDs) I, II, III, and IV (Fig. 5).
Analysis of the promoter region revealed that the transcrip-
tional activators NF-κB and ATF-2/c-Jun bind to PRD II and
PRD IV elements, respectively, and activate, in cooperation
with PRD I and PRD III, the IFN-β gene in virus-infected cells
(59). PRD I and PRD III elements, which members of the IRF
family can recognize, are essential as virus-inducible enhan-
cers of IFN-β induction (60–63). As for the IFN-α genes, it
was reported that the PRD-like elements (PRD-LEs), which are
similar to the PRD I and PRD III elements in the IFN-β
promoter, are found within IFN-α promoters (64). A recent
study using the gene-targeting strategy revealed that two
structurally related members, IRF-3 and IRF-7, are essential
factors for the IFN-α/β gene induction in response to viruses
(65).

IRF-3 and IRF-7 in the induction of IFN-α/β genes

The two-step induction model was previously proposed as a
mechanistic view of the IRF-3- and IRF-7-mediated pathway
for the induction of IFN-α/β genes in response to virus
infection. In the initial phase (Fig. 5, left), IRF-3, which is
constitutively expressed in normally growing cells, plays a
dominant part in the initial induction of IFN-α/β genes
(66–69). In fact, virus infection results in the serine/threo-
nine phosphorylation of IRF-3 at its carboxy-terminal region
by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and inhibitor of NF-κB
kinase ε (IKKε) (70, 71) to become an active form. The

Fig. 5. Two-step induction of IFN-α/β genes upon viral infection. The initial phase of induction of IFN-α/β genes, which is mediated by IRF-3, mainly acts on the IFN-β gene (2). The late phase of induction of activated IRF-3 undergoes nuclear translocation and binds to IRF elements (PRD I, III) in the IFN-β promoter. Unlike IRF-3, IRF-7 expression is inducible by IFN-α/β stimulation (68, 72). IFN-α/β, produced in the initial phase of viral infection, induces IRF-7, which mainly participates in the late phase of IFN-α/β gene induction (Fig. 5, right). Thus, this indicates the two-step induction of IFN-α/β genes by virus infection, wherein IRF-3 and IRF-7 each play a distinctive role in the regulation of virus-induced IFN production (65). Recent progress in understanding TLR signaling has provided a more complicated view for the involvement of these two IRFs in the IFN-α/β gene induction, which is contingent upon cell types and a variety of stimuli such as viruses and pathogen-associated molecules.

Involvement of the IFN-α/β system in the regulation of bone remodeling

The clue to the unexpected function of type I IFN in bone metabolism has been obtained in the genome-wide screening using GeneChip: during the course of our study to analyze genes induced by RANKL, induction of mRNAs known to be commonly induced by IFN-α/β was noted (54). Although the integral role of the IFN-α/β system in the immune system has been extensively documented, as described above, it was unknown whether this system is linked to RANKL signaling. To investigate the physiological role of the IFN system in the

IFN-α/β genes: the IFN-induced IRF-7 is activated and acts on both IFN-α and -β genes to amplify the IFN production. The latter step is therefore considered as a positive feedback regulation.

control of bone homeostasis, the skeletal system of mice deficient in one of the IFN receptor components, IFNAR1 (IFNAR1⁻/⁻ mice) was examined (54). Surprisingly, a notable reduction of trabecular bone mass, a characteristic feature of osteoporosis, was observed in the mutant mice. Concomitantly, the number of osteoclasts was notably increased in the bone of the IFNAR1⁻/⁻ mice, relative to the wildtype (WT) mice. Quantitative bone morphometric analyses further revealed a significant decrease in the trabecular bone volume diagnostic for enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption, without any remarkable difference in the markers of osteoblastic bone formation, indicating that IFN-α/β signaling is physiologically critical for maintaining the normal bone mass by regulating osteoclastic bone resorption. RANKL-induced osteoclast formation in vitro is remarkably enhanced in BMMs from IFNAR1⁻/⁻ mice, whereas no difference was seen in the osteoblast differentiation between cultured calvarial cells from the WT and IFNAR1⁻/⁻ mice. Thus, the enhanced osteoclastogenesis in IFNAR1⁻/⁻ mice is due to a cell-autonomous abnormality of BMMs.

The importance of RANKL-mediated induction of the IFN-β gene

Interestingly, RANKL stimulation resulted in the induction of mRNA of IFN-β but not of IFN-α in BMMs. The results thus suggest that unlike the common function of these two IFN

Immunological Reviews 208/2005 187
subtypes against viral infection, IFN-$\beta$ is selectively involved in this osteoclast regulation (although the mRNA induction levels were much lower compared with those in virus-induced cells). When the skeletal system of the mice lacking IFN-$\beta$ (IFN-$\beta^{-/-}$ mice) was examined, these mice also exhibited severe osteopenia resulting from enhanced osteoclastogenesis, indicating the role of RANKL-induced IFN-$\beta$ in bone homeostasis.

The inhibitory effect of recombinant mouse IFN-$\beta$ is remarkably strong on the RANKL/macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF)-induced osteoclastogenesis, in that its profound effect was observed at a concentration as low as 1 U/ml. IFN-$\beta$ (as well as IFN-$\alpha$) invokes cellular responses through activation/induction of transcription factors; those include ISGF3, Stat1 homodimer, and IRF-1 as described in Fig. 2. It was found that the inhibitory action of IFN-$\beta$ is abrogated in BMMs from mice lacking Stat1 or IRF-9, indicating that the inhibitory action is linked to the ISGF3-mediated gene-induction pathway (Fig. 3).

To assess the in vivo efficacy of IFN-$\beta$ for the suppression of osteoclast-mediated pathological conditions, an endotoxin-induced model of inflammatory bone destruction was applied. Daily administration of IFN-$\beta$ into the inflamed site has markedly inhibited osteoclast formation and bone resorption, indicating that IFN-$\beta$ indeed has a beneficial effect against bone destruction, most likely by downregulating osteoclastogenesis.

### Requirement of c-Fos in IFN-$\beta$ gene induction by RANKL

As mentioned above, the induction of IFN-$\alpha/\beta$ gene in virally infected cells absolutely requires two IRF transcription factor members, IRF-3 and IRF-7 (65). In the case of IFN-$\beta$, it has also been known to depend on NF-$\kappa$B (which is activated also by RANKL) (73). Interestingly, when the RANKL-induced IFN-$\beta$ mRNA expression was examined in BMMs from mice lacking c-Fos or both IRF-3 and IRF-9, the RANKL-induced expression of IFN-$\beta$ mRNA was no longer observed in the cells deficient in c-Fos, but this induction was normally observed in the cells deficient in these IRFs. It should be noted that the IRF-3/IRF-9 double-knockout cells are deficient in the induction of IRF-7, and therefore essentially serve as IRF-3/IRF-7 double-knockout cells, which are completely defective in the induction of IFN-$\alpha/\beta$ gene by virus (65). Furthermore, RANKL stimulation induced a significant activation of the IFN-$\beta$ promoter, as examined by a reporter gene transfection assay, and this activation was abrogated in cells of c-Fos-deficient mice. Thus, the RANKL-induced c-Fos per se induces its own inhibitor gene, IFN-$\beta$. These results in toto revealed the new RANKL-mediated IFN-$\beta$ gene induction mechanism that is distinct from that for virus-induced IFN-$\alpha/\beta$ gene induction in the innate immune response. It is most likely that NF-$\kappa$B-binding PRD II and c-Fos-binding PRD IV elements, which are found in IFN-$\beta$ promoter but not IFN-$\alpha$ promoters, are sufficient and responsible for the RANKL induction of the IFN-$\beta$ gene.

Our study also revealed a hitherto unknown signaling crosstalk between RANKL and the IFN-$\beta$ system, which is critical for bone homeostasis. This crosstalk is unique in that RANKL signaling per se is responsible for IFN-$\beta$ induction and that c-Fos, the positive regulator of RANKL signaling, is required for the induction of its own inhibitor (Fig. 3). In view of the osteoporotic phenotype found in mice lacking IFN-$\beta$ or its receptor, we believe that this novel negative feedback regulation mechanism is physiologically important for maintaining the bone mass. In this context, it would be interesting to determine if the negative regulation of osteoclastogenesis by IFN-$\beta$ is modulated in the osteopenic disease conditions.

### Signaling crosstalk between RANKL and IFN-$\beta$

To identify the downstream effector(s) of RANKL signaling affected by IFN-$\beta$ signaling, immunoblot analysis was carried out to identify the effector molecules of RANKL signaling in IFN-$\beta$-treated BMMs. It was found that the expression of c-Fos was selectively and dramatically downregulated (54). To examine further if the inhibitory action of IFN-$\beta$ is mediated through downregulation of c-Fos expression, c-Fos was ectopically expressed by retrovirus-mediated gene transfer in BMMs. Interestingly, the retrovirus-infected cells showed strong resistance to IFN-$\beta$-mediated suppression of osteoclast differentiation, supporting further the notion that c-Fos is indeed the critical target of IFN-$\beta$ signaling (54).

Regarding the mechanism underlying the inhibition of c-Fos expression by IFN-$\beta$, the RANKL-induced c-Fos mRNA was not significantly altered by IFN-$\beta$, thereby suggesting a post-transcriptional control mechanism(s). To gain further insights into the c-Fos suppression mechanism by IFN-$\beta$, the synthesis of the c-Fos protein was examined by the pulse-chase experiment, and it was found that c-Fos protein synthesis is inhibited inAlthough further studies are required, the series of observations on the novel role of IFN-β may offer new therapeutic approaches to bone diseases such as inflammation-induced bone destruction and osteoporosis. In fact, exogenous application of IFN-β indeed has a beneficial effect against bone destruction in the LPS-induced model, most likely by down-regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Our preliminary results also suggest that the systemic administration of IFN-β can reverse the bone loss in an osteoporosis model of ovariectomized mice. In addition, identification of the critical target gene(s) of IFN-β responsible for the suppression of osteoclastogenesis may provide further insights into the regulation of bone remodeling.

### Novel function of Stat1 in bone remodeling

Despite the distinct mechanisms of regulating osteoclast differentiation by IFN-β and IFN-γ, Stat1 is critically involved in both mechanisms to suppress RANKL signaling (Fig. 3). These mechanisms are consistent with the canonical activation pathway of Stat1 dependent on its phosphorylation: Stat1 resides in the cytoplasm in the latent form, and the binding of IFNs to their receptors results in the activation of Jak family kinases, which phosphorylate tyrosine 701 of Stat1. Phosphorylated Stat1 leads to the activation of transcription factors, which include ISGF3 and GAF (36, 37) (Fig. 2). It was also reported that unphosphorylated Stat1 is involved in the transcriptional control (74), but there has been no evidence that Stat1 has a physiological function in the cytoplasm.

To investigate the physiological function of Stat1 in the skeletal system, the bone phenotype of Stat1−/− mice was examined (75). Consistent with the observation that Stat1 is required for the IFN-β-mediated inhibition of osteoclastogenesis, we found an increased osteoclast number and enhanced osteoclastic bone resorption in Stat1−/− mice. However, the Stat1−/− mice had an increased bone mass, unlike the IFNAR1−/− mice that exhibited osteopenia. This unexpected bone phenotype of the Stat1−/− mice prompted us to examine the status of bone-forming osteoblasts in these mice. Bone morphometric analysis revealed a notable increase in bone formation rate and other osteoblast parameters such as osteoid surface/thickness and osteoblast surface, suggesting that excessive osteoblast differentiation is responsible for the increased bone mass. In vitro osteoblast differentiation was significantly enhanced in the absence of Stat1. These results indicate that Stat1 interferes with osteoblast differentiation and bone formation.

### Cytoplasmic attenuation of Runx2 by Stat1

To gain insights into the mechanism by which Stat1 interferes with the osteoblast differentiation program, we examined the role of Stat1 in signaling events induced by the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2, a potent osteogenic cytokine. Briefly, BMP-2 binds to its receptor, which induces the phosphorylation of Smad-family proteins such as Smad1, Smad5, and Smad8, resulting in the formation of a trimetric complex with Smad4 (76). The Smad complex translocates to the nucleus and cooperates with another class of transcription factor, Runx2, to activate the transcription of osteoblast-specific genes (77). The expression of Stat1 resulted in a strong inhibition of the Runx2-dependent activation of the osteocalcin promoter, without affecting the Smad1-dependent promoter activation, suggesting that Stat1 selectively interferes with the transcriptional activity of Runx2. Indeed, an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using the Runx2-binding probe revealed that the DNA-binding activity of Runx2 is upregulated in Stat1−/− osteoblasts. Although a study using Runx2 transgenic mice suggested that the abnormal expression of Runx2 at the late stage of osteoblast differentiation may affect bone formation (78, 79), Stat1 mice provide an interesting model in which the temporal Runx2 expression is normal but its activity is enhanced.

Is the inhibitory effect of Stat1 on Runx2 activity dependent on its activation by phosphorylation? In the context of the signaling of IFNs and other cytokines, Stat1 is activated by phosphorylation at tyrosine 701. Interestingly, the phosphorylation of tyrosine 701 of Stat1 was barely detectable in osteoblasts irrespective of BMP-2 stimulation. In addition, the inhibitory effect on Runx2 was exerted by a mutant form of Stat1 in which tyrosine 701 is converted to phenylalanine, showing that the inhibition of Runx2 activity by Stat1 is independent of phosphorylation.

Finally, we investigated the association between Stat1 and Runx2 and found that the inhibitory effect of Stat1 on Runx2 is dependent on the physical interaction between the two molecules. The overexpression of Runx2 resulted in the nuclear localization of the protein, but the coexpression of Stat1 with Runx2 maintained Runx2 in the cytoplasm, inhibiting the nuclear localization and transcriptional activity of Runx2. Thus, unphosphorylated Stat1 residing in the cytoplasm associates with Runx2 and attenuates the activity of Runx2. The mode of action of Stat1 is unique in that it interferes with another transcription factor, Runx2, in the cytoplasm in its transcriptionally latent form (Fig. 6).

Stat1 has no effect on Smad-dependent transcriptional activity, but it strongly inhibits Runx2-dependent activity. Stat1 inhibited the nuclear localization of Runx2 by their physical association in the cytoplasm. This effect is independent of Stat1 phosphorylation or IFN signaling.

**Function of Stat1 in chondrocytes**

An activating mutation in FGFR3 results in human achondroplasia, one of the most common congenital diseases characterized by dwarfism (80). Several studies proposed that the inhibitory effect of FGF-activated Stat1 on chondrocyte proliferation causes impaired endochondral ossification and skeletal malformation in achondroplasia (81, 82). But, there was no severe abnormality in the gross development of skeletons, longitudinal bone length, or growth plate anatomy in Stat1−/− mice, suggesting that the physiological contribution of Stat1 to endochondral bone formation is minimal. Although Stat1 is involved in the inhibitory effect of FGF on chondrocyte proliferation, recent studies suggest that dwarfism in achondroplasia is not associated with Stat1 but with the activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Notably, the constitutive activation of the MAPK pathway results in an achondroplasia-like phenotype in mice, and transgenic mice carrying an activating mutation (G374R) in FGFR3 develop an achondroplasia-like phenotype even in a Stat1-deficient background (83). Furthermore, the overexpression of the C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP) in chondrocytes rescues achondroplasia by suppressing the activation of the MAPK pathway without affecting the Stat1 pathway (84). These results show that the MAPK pathway is more important in terms of the regulation of the hypertrophic differentiation of chondrocytes, and the Stat1-mediated inhibition of cell proliferation may not be responsible for the

abnormal endochondral ossification in achondroplasia, although further studies are necessary to clarify the molecular basis of this discrepancy.

**Novel regulatory mechanism of Runx2 and bone formation**

The role of Stat1 in the inhibition of Runx2 is interesting in that this and other transcription factor members crosstalk in the cytoplasm. Runx2 has been identified as the central transcription factor for bone formation, but how its function is regulated has largely been unknown. There was no acceleration of ossification in newborn Stat1−/− mice, suggesting that the physiological regulatory function of Stat1 is not important for the skeletal development but critical for bone remodeling at the postnatal stage. Recently, Bialek et al. (85) have identified the Twist transcription factor as a negative regulator of Runx2 during the development of the skeletal system. Taken together, we conclude that the Runx2 function is regulated by distinct mechanisms between embryonic development and remodeling of the skeletal system. These findings suggest the importance of the temporal and spatial regulation of Runx2 for the normal development and homeostatic regulation of the skeletal system: Twist regulates Runx2 in the nucleus during embryogenesis, and Stat1 regulates Runx2 in the cytoplasm in the adult bone.

Runx family transcription factors play an important role in various biological systems such as hematopoiesis, bone metabolism, and oncogenesis (86, 87). In addition, accumulating evidence suggests that the Runx family regulates the differentiation of immune cells (88). Interestingly, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in Runx-binding sites is associated with the onset of several autoimmune diseases including systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis (89–91). The unexpected bone phenotype revealed an intriguing crosstalk between Stat1 and Runx2, indicating that the regulation of bone metabolism by immunomodulatory molecules extends beyond the regulation of osteoclastic bone resorption. The regulation of Runx by Stat family members may shed light on new aspects of an intricate network linking the immune and skeletal systems and provide a novel therapeutic strategy for osteopenic diseases.

**Conclusion**

The discovery of the RANKL-RANK system has brought about rapid progress in the understanding of the regulatory mechanisms of osteoclast differentiation exerted by the immune system. Here we have described the novel role of IFNs in the

skeletal system, which may have clinical implications. Recently, we have also worked on the analysis of NFATc1, the master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, and immunoreceptors functioning as costimulatory factors for RANKL signaling, both of which are discussed in other articles

in this volume. These findings collectively show that the osteoimmunological insight will be increasingly beneficial for not only understanding the physiology of the skeletal and immune systems but also developing novel therapeutic strategies for diseases related to both systems.
