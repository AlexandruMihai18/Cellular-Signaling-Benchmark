Summary: Intercellular interactions are critical for a coordinated function of different cell types involved in the immune response. Here we review the cellular and molecular events occurring during cell-cell immune contacts. Cognate naïve CD4⁺ T lymphocyte-dendritic cell (DC) and primed T cell-antigen-presenting B lymphocyte interactions are discussed. The engagement of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) or natural killer cells (NK) with their targets is analyzed and compared to the process of T cell-antigen-presenting cell (APC) conjugate formation. The immunological synapse, a complex cluster of molecules organized at the contact area of cell conjugates, exhibits common features but shows some differences depending on cell types involved. Cellular interactions occur in sequential stages that involve dramatic changes in cell polarity and dynamic redistribution of cell membrane receptors. The role of membrane microdomains, adaptor molecules and the cytoskeleton in the regulation of the molecular reorganization at cell-cell contacts is also discussed.

Introduction

Host defense relies on the concerted action of different cell types within the immune system. T lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells (APC), including macrophages, dendritic cells (DC) and B lymphocytes, cooperate in the recognition of antigen during the induction of immune response. The coordination of this response requires a highly specialized system of cellular communication based on physical contact of cells, along with the action of soluble factors such as cytokines. This review will focus on cell-cell interactions taking place during the immune response.

Membrane proteins that mediate immune cell-cell interactions fall into different categories, namely those involved in antigen recognition, costimulation and cellular adhesion. These systems share two intrinsic properties: their ability to regulate each other's interaction and/or signaling ('receptor cross-talk'), and their versatility, which enables them to exert

different functions during the immune response. Thus, the establishment of cell–cell cognate interactions is a dynamic process which triggers a cascade of events, temporarily modifying the regulation of intercellular adhesions and intracellular signaling.

A perspective of different cell–cell adhesive interactions representative of the most important cellular events taking place during the immune response is depicted in Fig. 1.

The process of antigen recognition during Tcell–APC interaction leads to the activation and the priming of naïve CD4⁺ Tlymphocytes by DC. Another issue of extensive study in this field is the cognate interaction between T and Blymphocytes. Finally, the interaction of cytotoxic Tcells or natural killer (NK) cells with their targets is also an important event that

entails adaptive and innate immune responses against malignant and virally infected cells. The molecules that participate in these intercellular interactions will be discussed in depth, paying special attention to those involved in cell adhesion.

Cell–cell interaction during the induction of the immune responses

CD4⁺ naïve Tlymphocyte–DC interaction

DC are professional APC endowed with the capacity of initiating the induction of primary immune responses. Immature DC capture antigens and migrate towards secondary lymphoid organs. They arrive at the Tcell areas of lymph nodes as mature DC, which are characterized by their extraordinary

capability to present antigen and activate naïve CD4⁺ T lymphocytes (1). Antigenic peptides bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules on the surface of DC are recognized by the T-cell receptor (TCR) expressed on the surface of T lymphocytes. A sustained TCR stimulation is required for activation of naïve T cells, a necessary phenomenon for their proliferation and differentiation into effector cells (2, 3). Remarkably, it has been recently demonstrated that the activation of naïve T lymphocytes by DC through direct interaction may take place even in the absence of antigen recognition. It has been suggested that this could be a mechanism for maintaining the pool of naïve T cells (4, 5).

Although DC are the only APC capable of stimulating naïve T cells, it remains to be determined whether this ability results from the expression of molecules restricted to DC and/or from the high density of adhesion and costimulatory molecules expressed by these cells. In this regard, a DC-expressed adhesion molecule, dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing nonintegrin (DC-SIGN) has recently been identified. DC-SIGN binds to intercellular adhesion molecule-3 (ICAM-3) with high affinity and is involved in adhesion between DC and T cells in the absence of antigen recognition (6). Hence, DC-SIGN-ICAM-3 interaction is important in the establishment of the initial, antigen-independent, DC-T cell contact that allows the TCR to scan the surface of the DC in search of specific peptide-MHC complexes (6, 7). Other receptors are involved in DC-T cell interactions, including the leukocyte integrin LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), which interacts with ICAM-1 (CD54), ICAM-2 (CD102), and ICAM-3 (CD50), the CD2/LFA-3 (CD58) adhesion receptors, and the CD28/CD80 costimulatory molecules (8–10). These molecules are involved in both the stabilization of the interaction and the initiation of intracellular signaling (7, 9, 11). Recently, novel molecular mechanisms of DC-mediated T-cell activation have been reported, involving several other molecules expressed by DC such as CD13, CD148, CD87, CD98, CD147 (12), neural cell adhesion molecule L1 (13), and CD83 (14). Vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1, CD106), also expressed by some DC subsets, interacts with the VLA-4 integrin and preferentially costimulates the proliferation of resting T cells, compared to antigen-preactivated CD4⁺ T cells (15). Moreover, the relative paucity of CD43 on DC, a major contributor to the repulsive forces and steric hindrance of cell surface, may facilitate contacts of DC membrane with T lymphocytes (16, 17).

It is evident that the high levels of expression of adhesion and costimulatory molecules by DC enable them to form stable clusters with naïve T lymphocytes and to efficiently trigger these cells for enough time to allow their commitment. This unique stimulatory capability of DC is also related to their extensive cell membrane processes, including spiny dendrites, bulbous pseudopods, and cell lamellipodia or veils (18). Unlike other APC, DC actively polarize the actin cytoskeleton during their interaction with T cells, which may also account for their high ability to activate resting T cells (19).

T-B cell cognate interaction

Upon priming by DC, activated CD4⁺ Thelper cells migrate to the border between the T- and B-cell areas of secondary lymphoid organs, where they meet B cells that have taken up antigen from follicular dendritic cells (20, 21). T-cell specific recognition of peptide-MHC complexes on the B cell surface promotes B lymphocyte survival and proliferation as well as their differentiation into antibody secreting cells. Thus, direct cognate interaction between T and B cells is the key event in the delivery of help during the humoral immune response to thymus dependent antigens (22).

The formation of stable T cell-B cell, antigen-specific conjugates depends on the binding of different adhesive receptors to their ligands, which reinforces the strength of the rather weak TCR-MHC peptide interaction. CD4, which is expressed by Thelper cells and recognizes a nonpolymorphic region of MHC class II molecules, plays an important role in both signal transduction and strengthening the interaction between T and B cells. Early functional studies showed that anti-CD4 Abs inhibited T-cell-dependent B-cell activation due to the blockade of conjugate formation between T and B cells (23–25). Another important T-cell coreceptor that contributes to adhesion between T cells and B cells is CD2. This molecule binds to LFA-3 and plays a critical role in initiating T cell-B cell interaction prior to TCR engagement (26). Thus, CD2/LFA-3 interaction may seem to provide the adhesive scaffold necessary for antigen recognition. In addition, we have demonstrated that ICAM-3/LFA-1 interaction initiates antigen-independent adhesion between T and B cells prior to antigen recognition (7).

Both T and B cells express ICAM-1 and LFA-1, which bind to each other and mediate intercellular adhesion (27–29). It has been suggested that LFA-1/ICAM-1 interaction strengthens the T cell-B cell contact following TCR engagement (26). In addition, members of the CD2 subset of the immunoglobulin superfamily, including CD244 (2B4), the signaling lymphocytic activating molecule (SLAM, CD150) and CD84 have been involved in T-cell activation. SLAM and CD84 have been reported to function as homophilic adhesion molecules, thus acting as costimulatory molecules and regulatory

lating T- and B-cell responses (30–33). CD22, expressed by B cells, is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily that can activate B cells and modulate antigen receptor signaling (34). CD22 mediates cell adhesion through its Ig domains, which bind to glycans through a sialic acid-dependent mechanism (35–37). Several reports have identified CD22 binding as a potential costimulatory signal for T cells that may amplify or modulate signals during T cell-B cell collaboration (38, 39). However, the biological ligands for CD22 and its role in T cell-B cell interactions remains to be elucidated.

Cytotoxic effector cell-target cell interaction

Activated CD8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) play an important role in the killing of malignant and virally infected cells during the adaptive immune response. CTL actively recirculate and constitute a crucial effector mechanism against noncytopathic viruses (40). CTL activation usually follows processing of antigens via endogenous pathways with peptide presentation in association with MHC class I molecules on the surface of target cells. CTL-target cell interaction can be divided into three stages: 1. recognition of and attachment to the target cells by CTL; 2. interaction of TCR with the peptide/MHC complex; 3. induction of target cell apoptosis via perforin release or Fas-L/Fas interaction.

CD8 recognizes a conserved region of class I MHC molecules on target cells and plays a costimulatory and adhesive role (41). LFA-1 was initially described as a costimulatory molecule involved in the cytotoxic activity of lymphocytes (42). As described for the T cell-APC interaction, LFA-1 plays an essential role in adhesion of CTL to target cells (43), and TCR engagement transiently stimulates cell adhesiveness through LFA-1 (44). Other costimulatory molecules, such as CD2, CD28, and CD40L (CD154), also function as adhesion molecules and are mutually regulated. In this regard, ligation of CD28 induces CD154 expression, thus reinforcing the T-cell response (45). NK cells are involved in early protection against microbial infection and tumor cell invasion prior to development of adaptive immunity. NK cytotoxic activity is not restricted by MHC molecules and occurs in the absence of prior sensitization (46). Such an innate response is triggered through the recognition of susceptible tumor or virus-infected target cells by invariant receptors. The balance between positive and negative signals provided by these receptors leads to a final decision about the lysis of the target cell. Among a great variety of killer receptors, the NK cell-target cell immune synapse includes the killer cell Ig-like receptors (KIR), which mainly interact with HLA-C molecules expressed on the surface of the target cell (47). NK cells bind to many different cells but kill those that do not express ligands (e.g., HLA-C molecules) of NK membrane receptors (e.g., KIR), which suppress the cytolytic activity of NK cells (48). On the other hand, the positive signals for target cell lysis are induced through activating receptors that also bind to class I MHC molecules (49).

As shown for other types of conjugates, NK cell-target cell interaction is dependent on many adhesion and costimulatory molecules. Most receptors involved in activation of NK cells, such as CD2 and CD154, are also found in T cells (50). IL-2-activated human NK cells express CD154, which interacts with CD40 on target cells, triggering a potent stimulatory signal (51). Adhesion molecules, such as LFA-1, can also provide activation signals. In this regard, anti-LFA-1 antibodies inhibit NK-cell-mediated cytotoxicity (52), and LFA-1-null mice show impaired conjugate formation of NK cells with target cells (53). The cell adhesion mediated by LFA-1 is regulated by KIR, and signaling through these molecules interrupts the process of NK-target cell conjugate formation (54). Distinct adhesion receptors cooperate in the binding between effector and target cells required for the initiation of cytotoxicity. CD44, which binds to membrane hyaluronic acid on tumor cells, collaborates with LFA-1 in the formation of stable lymphokine-activated NK cell-target cell conjugates (53). LFA-1 molecules expressed by NK cells are also involved in stimulation through their interaction with ICAM-2 of target cells (55). Other adhesion molecules show differential expression in different subsets of NK cells. CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells express high levels of L-selectin (CD62L) (56). In contrast, CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells lack CD62L but show a high expression of P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1) (57). This differential expression of adhesion molecules could contribute to the distinct functional properties of NK cell subsets. In addition, NK cells collaborate with the adaptive immune response, mediating the lysis of antibody-coated targets through the low-affinity receptor for IgG CD16 (FcγRIII), which is highly expressed by the CD56<sup>dim</sup> cell subset (50).

Stages of T cell-APC interaction

The interaction of T lymphocytes and APC involves different cellular events that take place in a sequential manner. Initially, T cells migrate towards the APC, and their encounter is initiated by antigen-independent weak adhesion forces, allowing the TCR to scan the APC surface for specific antigen. Following antigen recognition, several mechanisms contribute to the stabilization of the T cell-APC conjugate, which

maintains both cells in close contact during stimulation (Fig. 2).

T-lymphocyte polarization and migration

Lymphocyte migration presents unique features that are clearly related to the milieu in which they are moving. Different aspects of the process of lymphocyte migration have been addressed. The emigration of lymphocytes from the bloodstream to the tissue comprises one step known as transmigration or extravasation (58, 59). Other studies have been focused on the cytoskeletal and morphological changes occurring in lymphocytes migrating across tissue. Under these conditions, lymphocytes develop a profound change of shape, with the establishment of two asymmetrical planes (instead of the lack of asymmetrical planes in circulating spherical lymphocytes), one defined by substrate interactions and the other by front-rear polarity. The cell extends a broad, F-actin-enriched, front lamella (the leading edge), which serves as a sensory and propulsive pole in migrating lymphocytes. Accordingly, the leading edge contains clusters of receptors involved in lymphocyte chemotaxis, such as chemokine receptors CCR2, CCR5 and CXCR4 (60–63), as well as cytoskeletal components involved in the development of contractile force, such as F-actin and myosin light chain (MLC) (64). The other pole of the cell comprises a slender posterior appendage that protrudes over the plane of the substrate, termed the uropod (Fig. 2). Different adhesion molecules, such as ICAM-1, -2 and -3, CD43, CD44 and PSGL-1, are clustered into the uropod along with components of the cytoskeleton, such as members of the ezrin/radixin/moesin (ERM) family of proteins and the microtubule and intermediate filament network (65–69). The uropod exhibits a cell-recruiting activity through adhesive interactions trapping and transporting resting lymphocytes (70). In addition to morphological and receptor distribution asymmetry, a distinct pattern of cholesterol-enriched membrane microdomains (rafts) has been found in the cellular poles. In this regard, clusters of rafts are present at the uropod of T lymphocytes and are involved in the selective targeting of proteins to membrane domains (71). Moreover, the composition of rafts at the leading or rear edges of polarized cells seems to be different (72), although the biological significance of this fact remains undetermined.

Interaction of lymphocytes with APC requires the migration of T cells and the scanning of APC surface by the T lymphocyte. As discussed below, interaction of the T cell with the APC results in a change of polarity of the former cell. Adhesion molecules such as ICAM-3 and ICAM-1, which are concentrated at the uropod of migrating T cells, are found clustered to the area of contact with the APC. The mechanism by which this rear-to-front redistribution of adhesion receptors occurs is a matter of speculation. An interesting possibility is that adaptor molecules, such as ERM proteins, actively transfer these molecules at the cell-cell contact area. Directed secretion of vesicles or lateral movement of lipid rafts containing these clustered molecules is another potential mechanism that deserves further study.

Initial adhesive contact

When the T cell and the APC come in contact they must overcome the electrostatic repulsion caused by their negative surface electric charge (73, 74). It is very likely that the attractive force necessary to bypass this barrier depends on interactions between molecules of sufficient length to stand out from the negatively charged glycocalyx. These are probably low affinity interactions capable of mediating a loose contact between T cells and APC, thus allowing the serial scanning for antigen on the surface of different APC. It is very unlikely that the engagement of the TCR with peptide-MHC mediates this initial interaction, since they interact with extremely weak affinity (75–77). In addition, the concentration of specific ligands for a particular TCR on an APC is very low (78, 79). Furthermore, MHC molecules are very small (approximately 7 nm), and their binding site areas are easily buried or quenched by the negative charge of the glycocalyx (80). Thus, the initial contact between T cells and APC is most likely antigen-independent, relying on adhesion molecules with long extracellular domains.

Several pairs of adhesion molecules have been proposed to be involved in these initial adhesive interactions. One of the most extensively studied is CD2/LFA-3, which mediates adhesion of T cells and APC prior to TCR engagement (26). Accordingly, CD2/LFA-3 interaction has a relatively low affinity, and LFA-3 is widely expressed in resting cells (81, 82). However, both CD2 and LFA-3 are small molecules whose interaction is interfered with by the glycocalyx. It is likely that a previous active process initiates cell adhesion (83). Conversely, LFA-1 and its ligand ICAM-1 have long extracellular domains that span from the glycocalyx (84), although LFA-1 is usually in an inactive state on the cell membrane (85). Non-specific and antigen-specific signals provided by chemokines and TCR occupancy may activate LFA-1 (44, 86). However, the role of LFA-1 in the initial events of T cell-APC adhesion is controversial, as this molecule mediates adhesion through high affinity bonds, which seem to be optimal for

the stabilization of conjugates but not for mediating transient cell interactions (87).

The high expression of ICAM-3 in resting T lymphocytes, which present low levels of surface ICAM-1 (88), its costimulatory activity in these cells (7, 89–92), and the localization of this molecule at cell-cell contacts during cell homotypic aggregation (90) indicate that ICAM-3 has a key role in the initiation of immune cell-cell interactions. ICAM-3 establishes low affinity interactions with LFA-1 on the APC (93, 94). The identification of a novel ligand for ICAM-3, DC-SIGN, expressed by professional APC, further underscores the complex role of ICAM-3 in T cell-APC adhesive events. Recently, our group has provided evidence that ICAM-3 mediates the initial, antigen-independent adhesion of T cells and APC (7). Thus, ICAM-3 interaction with LFA-1 and DC-SIGN may provide the weak adhesive contact necessary for the scanning of the APC surface by T cells, followed by CD2/LFA-3 interaction, which may bring membranes to the close apposition necessary for TCR engagement with MHC-peptide. Engagement of TCR/CD3, ICAM-3 and CD2 has been shown to induce LFA-1/ICAM-1 adhesion (44, 90, 95), which would strengthen the T cell-APC contact following TCR recognition of specific peptide-MHC.

Stabilization of the T cell-APC conjugate

Once the initial contact between the T cell and the APC has been established, the second stage in conjugate formation is antigen-dependent and associated with the widening of the contact zone by extension of actin-based membrane protrusions from the T cell towards the APC (engulfing) (96–98). This process is accompanied by elevation of intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration by the T cell and massive actin polymerization at the cell-cell contact zone (96–100).

Molecular reorganization at the T cell-APC interface: the immunological synapse

Stable interactions between T cells and APC have been extensively studied, and the formation of a highly organized network of receptor and cytoplasmic proteins in the intercellular interphase, which is generally referred to as the immunological synapse, has been widely accepted (86, 101–104). The first observations on this 3-dimensional organization at the contact area were provided by Kupfer's group working in a model of T cell-B cell cognate interaction (105). They found that surface molecules are clustered into segregated 3-dimensional domains within the cell-cell interface, which they termed supramolecular activation clusters (SMACs). A central SMAC (cSMAC) comprises the TCR/CD3 and either CD4 or

CD8 interacting with MHC-peptide complexes on the APC (105–107) together with CD28, which interacts with CD80/86 at the APC (103). The intracellular signaling molecules PKCθ (105), lck, fyn, and ZAP-70 (105, 106) are also localized at the cSMAC in the inner side of the T cell membrane. It was hypothesized that the core provided by the cSMAC allows sustained TCR engagement and signaling (see below). A peripheral ring where LFA-1 interacts with ICAM-1 and which concentrates intracellular talin in the T cell provides an adhesive anchoring (105). CD2 binding to LFA-3 is localized between the core of TCR-MHC and the peripheral integrin ring (103).

The development of video-imaging techniques that allow the tracking of fluorescently labeled molecules in live cells has led to the current view that the formation of the immunological synapse is a very dynamic process. Molecular redistribution of adhesion and accessory receptors occur at the interface between the T cell and the APC within minutes. Using a planar membrane system as artificial APC, Dustin and colleagues found that LFA-1/ICAM-1 are initially clustered at the center of the synapse surrounded by a ring of TCR/MHC-peptide. This organization is inverted within minutes and finally renders a central accumulation of the TCR/MHC-peptide surrounded by LFA-1/ICAM-1 (107). CD4 also undergoes active relocation during the course of the formation of the immunological synapse. Although CD4 colocalizes with the TCRζ chain in clusters at the T cell-APC interface, this coreceptor subsequently moves to the peripheral ring, while the TCRζ chain is stabilized in a single cluster at the center of the synapse (106). Results from our group show that ICAM-3 accumulates within seconds at the site of initial contact of T cells with APC independently of antigen recognition, followed by ICAM-3 redistribution to the outer zone of the cell-cell interface upon antigen-dependent conjugate stabilization (7). These studies also show that the adaptor molecule LAT is located in a punctual cluster shortly after the initial contact of the T cell and the APC, and later accumulates throughout most of the contact region as the cell conjugate becomes stabilized (7). The membrane-bound tyrosine phosphatase CD45 is initially interspersed within microclusters of TCR prior to their condensation into the central zone. Then CD45 moves to the periphery of the TCR-condensed central zone but inside of the LFA-1 ring (108, 109). CD43, a large and heavily glycosylated membrane protein, was initially found to be excluded from the immunological synapse upon TCR stimulation (110). Most recently, different groups have analyzed in depth this molecular exclusion of CD43. Roumier et al. found that this molecule is localized at the cell-cell con-
tact area outside the two rings of SMACs (111), whereas others found it completely excluded from the contact area (112) or even at the distal pole of the T cell, away from the T cell–APC contact site (113). Accordingly, we have found that another heavily glycosylated molecule, the ligand of selectins, PSGL-1, is actively translocated to the opposite pole of the T cell–APC contact upon antigen recognition (7). It is likely that the exclusion of PSGL-1 and CD43 from the interaction site is due to their highly glycosylated nature, which could hamper membrane apposition. ERM proteins are responsible for the exclusion of CD43 from the synapse (111–113), although their exact mechanism of action is unclear at present. In contrast to this rearward movement of CD43 and PSGL-1, the MTOC, which is initially localized at the trailing edge of migrating cells, is translocated towards the synapse upon TCR recognition of peptide-MHC (66, 100, 114).

The main function of the synapse is still under discussion. Some investigators postulate that it serves to stabilize signal transduction by the TCR for the prolonged periods of time required for T-cell activation (101, 102, 104). Nevertheless, recent investigations demonstrate that TCR signaling precedes immunological synapse formation, arguing against this function (115). Others maintain that the main role of immunological synapse is linked to the delivery of secondary T-cell signaling and effector functions, such as the directed secretion of cytokines or cytotoxic granules (116) or even the downregulation of TCR expression (115).

Other types of immunological synapses

The immune synapse formed between CD4 T lymphocytes and APC is stable, providing the sustained TCR signaling required for full T-cell activation (107). In contrast, the contacts between preactivated CTL and target cells are very transient; video-tracking of living CTL has shown that 2–10 min are sufficient to mediate efficient target cell killing (117). Upon target cell recognition, CTL rapidly relocate their MTOC and lytic granules towards the cell pole that interacts with the target cell (118). Since CTL do not require sustained signaling for their effector function, it has been questioned whether the CTL–target cell interaction corresponds to an immunological synapse. However, it has been reported that the transfer of antigen from the target cell to the CTL during killing leads to the recognition of CTL as targets by neighboring T cells (119). This process of antigen transfer suggests the formation of a complex structure at the interface between CTL and target cells (119, 120). In this regard, although target cell death occurs rapidly after CTL–target cell contact, it has been found that a complete immune synapse with a pSMAC of adhesion molecules surrounding a cSMAC of signaling proteins is formed (121). The pSMAC contains LFA-1 and talin, while the cSMAC is segregated in two compartments: the signaling domain, with Lck and PKC-θ, and the secretion domain, at which the lytic granules polarize and secrete their content (121) (Fig. 1). In this way, cytotoxic T cells rapidly develop an ultrastructure highly efficient for target cell lysis.

The interface between NK cells and their targets also shows a complex macromolecular pattern distinct to that displayed at the T cell–APC contact. The crystal structure of KIR/MHC I complexes reveals that recognition of MHC by KIR is less stringent than by the TCR (122). However, the distance occupied by the interaction of the TCR or KIR with MHC is similar (<15 nm), allowing the development in these NK inhibitory interactions of structures similar to the cSMAC of the T cell–APC immune synapse. In this regard, immune synapses have been described between an NK cell line expressing KIR2D and a class I-transfected B cell line (47). Target cells expressing the relevant MHC class I ligand also induce the accumulation of the Ly49A inhibitory receptor at the interface between NK cells and target cells (123). KIR, expressed by NK cells, induce the clustering of HLA-C at the contacting surface of target cells. HLA-C/KIR is distributed in peripheral rings around central patches of ICAM-1/LFA-1 at target cell–NK cell inhibitory synapses (47), in contrast to the mature structure found in T cell–APC synapses (105). Signaling through KIR2D NK receptor is not required for receptor-ligand clustering at the inhibitory NK immune synapse (124). However, parallel analysis of NK cell membrane lipid rafts revealed that KIR2D signaling is critical for lipid raft polarization and NK cell cytotoxicity (124). During NK–target cell interactions both activating and inhibitory receptors are engaged, but activating receptors are dampened down by the predominant KIR-mediated inhibition through the ITIM-associated SHP-1 phosphatase (125). Analysis of the KIR2DL3-positive NK clones during cytolytic and non-cytolytic interactions has shown two different synaptic organizations (126). Reorientation of MTOC and its associated kinases, such as Pyk2, specifically occurs during productive interactions (127). The center of a cytolytic synapse comprises a complex of signaling molecules including Syk, ZAP-70, SLP-76, B cell linker protein, and SHP-1, surrounded by LFA-1, which is localized in the pSMAC (126). A differential compartmentalization of the Src and Syk/ZAP70 kinases is found within the cytolytic cSMAC. In contrast, the noncytolytic synapses contain SHP-1 but lack other components of the cSMAC (126).

The formation of immunological synapses has also been reported in B cells during their interaction with cells bearing on their surface the antigen specific for the BCR. Antigen

recognition by the B cell is accompanied by a reorganization
of the B cell surface. BCR is localized at the center of the syn-
apse, while CD45 and CD22 are excluded to the edges of
the contact area. In regard to intracellular components, actin,
phospholipase Cγ2 and phosphotyrosine-containing proteins
but not the phosphatase SHP-1 were detected at the immuno-
logical synapse (128).

Mechanisms underlying molecular reorganization at the
immunological synapse

The organization of surface receptors and signaling compo-
nents at the junction between T cells and APC is a key phe-
nomenon for the integration of signals delivered through
multiple receptor systems at the immunological synapse. How
this complex molecular segregation is accomplished is poorly
understood. Topological models propose that molecules pres-
ent at the T cell–APC interface are segregated according to
size, with small accessory molecules (CD2, CD4, CD8, CD28,
CD154) contributing to the formation of the close contact
zone, in which the TCR engages the peptide-MHC, and ex-
cluding from it large molecules like LFA-1/ICAM-1, ICAM-3,
CD43 and CD45 (129). Based on mathematical models, some
authors propose that the basis of this molecular segregation
relies on spontaneous self-assembly processes (130).

The organization of the plasma membrane in distinct
microdomains including lipid rafts, which are highly ordered
microdomains enriched in sphingolipids and cholesterol, is
an additional mechanism to assemble or segregate receptors
and signaling molecules. Different lines of evidence indicate
that accumulation of lipid rafts is an essential feature in the
formation of the immunological synapse (131–133). In this
regard, surface receptors and signaling molecules involved in
T-cell activation are localized in lipid rafts including CD8
(134), CD4 (135), lck, fyn (136), LAT (137, 138), Cbl/PAG
(139), Syk, Ras (136) and PKCθ (140). Other molecules only
translocate into lipid rafts upon TCR stimulation, including
Tyr-phosphorylated TCR (136, 141, 142), ZAP-70 (136,
141), PLCγ1, Vav, Grb2, and phosphatidylinositol 3-OH ki-
nase (PI3K) (136, 137). Cholesterol depletion dissociates
these proteins from rafts and inactivates the signaling cascade,
thus preventing full T-cell activation (136, 143). TCR engage-
ment triggers lipid raft aggregation at the contact area (144)
and increases the amount of rafts at the plasma membrane
(145). These are the most likely mechanisms by which lipid
rafts contribute to lymphocyte activation. Accordingly, Tlym-
phocyte costimulation by CD28 engagement leads to the re-
distribution and clustering of raft microdomains at the site of
TCR engagement (146). Other costimulatory molecules such

as CD5, CD9, CD2 and CD44 also induce the translocation of
the TCR/CD3 complex to rafts (147). Moreover, rafts contrib-
ute to the regulation of LFA-1 function and adhesion by
changing the avidity of this integrin (148). Thus, rafts serve
as platforms where the signaling cascades triggered through
antigen recognition are organized and protected from nonraft
enzymes, which may negatively regulate the propagation of
the signal. Nevertheless, how membrane rafts are involved in
the dynamics of immunological synapse construction remains
to be established.

APC also present superstructures of stimulatory receptors,
class I and II MHC molecules, and tetraspan family members,
which could be the key for interactions with T cells (149,
150). It has been suggested that these clusters could be re-
lated to rafts (149, 151), and this suggestion is in accordance
with the fact that the clustering of MHC class II molecules in
rafts enhances T-cell activation (152). Most recently, tetraspan
microdomains, a new class of membrane microdomains dis-
tinct from lipid rafts, which are enriched for specific peptide-
MHC class II complexes and tetraspan proteins, have been
described on the APC surface of DC and B cells (153). Tetra-
span microdomains may play a role in the concentration of
uniformly loaded peptide-MHC class II clusters on the APC
cell surface, thus generating a high avidity area of peptide-
loaded-MHC II complex that would enhance cognate T-cell
triggering.

The cytoskeleton is an important regulatory component in
the movement of surface proteins into the synapse. Immuno-
logical synapse formation is accompanied by dramatic reor-
ganization of the T lymphocyte cytoskeleton (86). The actin
cytoskeleton not only recruits surface receptors and signaling
molecules to the interaction plane but is also involved in
membrane dynamics, cell shape change and T-cell crawling
(96, 98). Inhibition of actin polymerization by cytochalasin D
prevents synapse formation (98, 154, 155), and interference
with either actin or myosin function prevents movement of
surface proteins to the contact zone (98, 154–156). Thus,
the actomyosin cytoskeleton is involved in the process of for-
mation of the immunological synapse. Myosin II generates a
flow of actin towards the synapse that requires engagement
of the TCR and is regulated by the two most important co-
stimulatory receptors, CD28 and LFA-1 (156). Actin poly-
merization at the immunological synapse would establish a
scaffold that stabilizes the T cell–APC conjugate and organizes
the assembly of receptor and signaling molecules. The actin
scaffold may also recruit or stabilize lipid rafts that concen-
trate in the vicinity of the engaged TCR (146).

Several adaptor molecules could link cell surface molecules
to the cytoskeleton. Talin is associated with areas of LFA-1 engagement within the immunological synapse (105) and has been implicated in lateral immobilization of integrin complexes (157). Thus, association of LFA-1 with talin could account for the localization of LFA-1 at the pSMAC. The localization of CD2 outside the center of the synapse but inside the integrin ring may be stabilized by CD2AP, an adaptor molecule involved in CD2 movement. CD2AP recruitment by CD2 in the Tcell–APC contact site results in receptor clustering, the binding of intracellular scaffolds and T-cell polarization (158). Vav may provide an appropriate linkage of the TCR to the actin cytoskeleton through the adaptor protein Fyb (159, 160). ERM proteins serve as general actin filament–plasma membrane linkers and play critical roles in dynamic remodeling of membrane structures by the actin cytoskeleton (161). ICAM-1, -2, and -3, CD43, CD44 and PSGL-1 associate with one or more of these proteins in distinct cell types (68, 162–165). By linking the actin cytoskeleton to cell surface molecules, ERM proteins serve to organize specialized cell surface structures and to control the distribution of cell surface molecules within these structures. ERM proteins are involved in the redistribution of ICAM-3 and PSGL-1 to the uropod of migrating leukocytes (69, 166). They are also responsible for the exclusion of CD43 from the Tcell–APC interface and their function seem to be critical for immunological synapse formation (111–113). It is conceivable that PSGL-1 exclusion from the contact is also directed by ERM proteins, although it has not been demonstrated. The differential subcellular targeting of ERM-associated ICAM-1 and -3, which play fundamental roles in establishing the immunological synapse, compared to CD43 and PSGL-1, is in accordance with their distinct involvement in the process of Tcell–APC recognition, and a complex regulation of association/dissociation of these membrane receptors from ERM proteins is suggested. These issues have not yet been addressed, although the passive diffusion of molecules across the plasma membrane cannot be ruled out.

There is a complex interplay between membrane microdomains and the cortical cytoskeleton, as well as between adaptor proteins linking surface receptors and signaling molecules to the cytoskeleton. However, the relationship among these different cellular systems during the interaction of Tlymphocytes and APC is not yet fully understood. A recent report showing the association of Cbp, a molecule exclusively localized in rafts, with EBP, which binds ERM proteins, has shed some light on the mechanism by which lipid rafts aggregate during immune synapse formation (167). Constitutive association of Cbp-EBP-ERM proteins would anchor the lipid rafts to the actin cytoskeleton and could serve as a negative regulatory mechanism in immune synapse formation, keeping T cells in a resting state. Since TCR engagement was found to induce the disassembly of this molecular complex, this engagement could result in the liberation of lipid rafts from cytoskeleton and their subsequent aggregation at the Tcell–APC interface (167). Since ERM proteins are found concentrated in the uropod of polarized migrating Tlymphocytes (68), which has also been shown to be enriched in lipid rafts (71, 72), an interesting possibility is that rafts are anchored to the uropod by ERM proteins during lymphocyte migration and that they would be released upon contact with an APC. Once allowed to move freely on the plasma membrane, they would then redistribute to the Tcell–APC contact site.

Tcell–APC detachment/conjugate termination. Given the intense efforts that have been made in the last decade to elucidate the mechanisms that drive antigen recognition in the context of an immune cell–cell interaction, the lack of information regarding the time course and mechanism of synapse resolution that allows T-cell detachment from APC is striking. The duration of the encounter between the Tcell and the APC is now a matter of intense debate (168, 169). It is well known that Tcells require sustained TCR stimulation to become fully activated (170, 171). There are two ways of achieving this sustained stimulation: formation of a stable conjugate with one APC, or establishment of transient sequential interactions with different APC. Depending on the experimental conditions used, both types of cell behaviors have been observed in vitro (100, 105, 156, 172). Serial cell–cell encounters have also been reported for conjugation processes established between CTL or NK cells with their targets (173). Together, these studies suggest the existence of multiple factors participating in the duration of the Tcell–APC interaction. Factors from the extracellular milieu, such as chemokine gradients (174) and extracellular matrix–integrin interactions (175), would account for the importance of the local microenvironment in which the interaction takes place. Other factors inherent to the process of antigen recognition, such as the dose and immunogenicity of the antigen and the density of costimulatory molecules, also affect the duration of Tcell–APC interaction (2, 176). In vivo imaging studies of Tcell–APC dynamics in lymph nodes are required to establish whether Tcells are activated mainly through interaction with a single or multiple APC as well as the time requirements. It has been proposed that CTL and Bcells acquire target cell membrane proteins (119, 120, 128). A complex organization of membrane bridges between the two cells has been proposed.
posed as the physical mechanism for this transferring process (121). CTL that have killed multiple targets accumulate target cell proteins, being then potentially recognized and killed by other CTL (119, 121). This process would provide a self-regulating mechanism for turning off the CTL response. These membrane transfers occur during disassembly of synapses, only after specific antigen-recognition, and involve not only MHC-I and other proteins but also lipids from the target cell, suggesting a role for membrane ripping after synapse resolution (120).

Less is known about the fate of the molecules at the T-cell side that are involved in the formation of the synapse. Does the T cell take advantage of the preformed complexes of membrane receptors, scaffolding and signaling molecules for future encounters with APC, or do they become dispersed and

the different molecular components return to their original location? The time requirements for the activation of T cells varies widely depending on cell priming. Hence, while naïve T cells require around 20 h of interaction with APC, antigen-primed T cells respond much more rapidly (1 h) (2). This observation would be consistent with the preservation of preformed synaptic organization that will be ready for future encounters with APC, which will be more efficient and therefore less time-consuming. Accordingly, activated T cells have been shown to present increased amounts of lipid rafts in their plasma membrane as compared to naïve cells (145). Whether these lipid rafts include the plethora of recognition receptor accessory and signaling molecules that has been induced upon antigen recognition remains a very interesting question.
