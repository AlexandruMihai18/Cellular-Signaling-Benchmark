Many parathyroid hormone (PTH)-mediated events in osteoblasts are thought to require immediate early gene expression. PTH induces the immediate early gene, c-fos, in this cell type through a cAMP-dependent pathway. The present work investigated the nuclear mechanisms involved in PTH regulation of c-fos in the osteoblastic cell line, UMR 106-01. By transiently transfecting c-fos promoter 5′ deletion constructs into UMR cells, we demonstrated that PTH induction of the c-fos promoter requires the major cAMP response element (CRE). Point mutations created in the major CRE within the largest construct inhibited both PTH-stimulated and basal expression. This element, therefore, performs concerted basal and PTH-responsive cis-acting functions. Gel retardation and Western blotting techniques revealed that CRE-binding protein (CREB) constitutively binds the major CRE but becomes phosphorylated at its cAMP-dependent protein kinase consensus recognition site following PTH treatment. CREB was functionally implicated in c-fos regulation by coexpressing a dominant CREB repressor, KCREB (killer CREB), with the c-fos promoter constructs. KCREB suppressed both basal and PTH-mediated c-fos induction. We conclude that PTH activates c-fos in osteoblasts through cAMP-dependent protein kinase-phosphorylated CREB interaction with the major CRE in the promoter region of the c-fos gene.

require the expression of primary response genes, such as c-fos, for their induction.

Several in vivo models have identified Fos as a player in bone biology. This factor was first linked to bone when it was discovered in a mouse osteosarcoma as the product of v-fos, the viral homolog of c-fos (4). Similarly, several groups have engineered mice that overexpress c-fos and display bone abnormalities including non-malignant bone neoplasms and collagenase-producing bone tumors (5, 6). Conversely, Fos null mice exhibit osteopetrosis and disorganized bone growth (7). Transgenic mice, which express a fos-lacZ fusion gene, also identified bone as one of the major sites for c-fos expression (8). In agreement with the rodent models, evidence for Fos involvement in human bone disease has been provided by high c-fos expression in Pagetic bone (9) and human osteosarcomas (10).

c-fos is regulated in a cell-specific manner through a variety of mechanisms. These signaling pathways most likely act through different combinations of highly conserved sites within the promoter region (11). The mechanism for c-fos induction in osteoblasts by the bone resorptive agent, PTH, has not yet been determined. Observations described in this and previous studies conducted in our laboratory (1) demonstrate that PTH activates c-fos transcription independent of de novo protein synthesis and mainly through increased intracellular cAMP. We therefore hypothesized that cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB) becomes phosphorylated by PKA allowing transcriptional activation through a cAMP response element (CRE). Current information supports this model because CREB is a constitutively expressed protein, which becomes activated upon phosphorylation within its P-box domain. CREB is then able to trans-activate genes that possess the CRE sequence. The c-fos 5′ regulatory region has several imperfect CRE sequences. However, only one CRE markedly causes cAMP-dependent c-fos promoter activation in Balb/3T3 cells (12). This site has therefore been referred to as the major CRE and was the focus of our experimental approach.

We present a dissection of the PTH-responsive segment within the c-fos 5′ regulatory region as well as describe the transcription factor activation mechanism. Specifically, the major CRE is required for PTH-mediated c-fos induction. This site confers basal expression through unphosphorylated CREB. However, PTH causes CREB to become phosphorylated within its PKA recognition site resulting in enhanced promoter function. These observations led to the following model. In unstimulated cells, CREB participates in basal c-fos expression through the major CRE. Upon PTH exposure, PKA phosphorylates, and thereby activates, CREB trans-activation functions. Increased Fos protein then participates in gene regulation in bone.

**PTH Regulates fos through CREB**

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Materials—Radiolabeled \[^{14}C\]chloramphenicol and enhanced chemiluminescence (ECL) reagents were obtained from Amersham Corp. DuPont NEN supplied \[\gamma-^{32}P\]ATP. Polyvinylidene difluoride membrane was purchased from Millipore (Bedford, MA). Oligonucleotides were synthesized by Midland Certified Reagent Co. (Midland, TX). Poly(dI-dC) was a product of Boehringer Mannheim. Tissue culture media and reagents were obtained from the Washington University Tissue Culture Center (St. Louis, MO). All other chemicals were obtained from Sigma or Fisher Scientific.

Antibodies—Anti-Fos antibodies were either purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc. (Santa Cruz, CA) or were a gift from Dr. Natalie Teich (Imperial Cancer Research Fund, London, United Kingdom). Anti-CREB antibody, raised against the P-box region of CREB (13), was a gift of Dr. Joel Habener (Massachusetts General Hospital and Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA). Antibodies to ATF-1 (hybridoma) and ATF-2 (mouse ascites) were gifts from Dr. James Hoeffler (University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, Denver, CO). Anti-phosphoCREB was purchased from Upstate Biotechnology Inc. (Lake Placid, NY). Horseradish peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG was purchased from both Bio-Rad and Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc.

Plasmids—Mouse *fos*-CAT 5′ deletion constructs –56 *fos*-CAT, –71 *fos*-CAT, –151 *fos*-CAT, and –356 *fos*-CAT (14–16) were provided by Dr. Michael Gilman (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY). KCREB expression plasmid (17) was a gift from Dr. John Chrivia (Saint Louis University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO). pSV-β-galactosidase control vector, pSV2CAT, and pSV0CAT plasmids were purchased from Promega Corp. (Madison, WI).

Cell Culture—UMR 106-01 cells were cultured as described previously (18). The treatment medium contained either 2% fetal bovine serum or 0.1% bovine serum albumin.

Western Blotting—For Fos detection, cell monolayers were washed with PBS (pH 7.6), scraped into PBS, and pelleted by centrifugation (200 × g, 10 min, room temperature). All further steps were conducted at 4°C or on ice as rapidly as possible and in the presence of 0.2 phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride because Fos protein is extremely labile in our hands. The cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, 0.2% SDS) and sonicated. Equal amounts of total protein as determined by the Bradford (19) dye binding (Bio-Rad reagent) method were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, electroblotted to polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and blocked overnight in 1% bovine serum albumin, Tween-Tris-buffered saline (TTBS) (0.1% Tween 80, 138 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, and 25 mM Tris base). For phosphoCREB detection, cells were lysed in the culture dishes by scraping directly into sample buffer, centrifuged briefly, boiled, and loaded onto an SDS-polyacrylamide gel since phosphorylation was so labile. Antibodies were diluted in 1% TTBS. Dr. Teich’s Fos antibody was diluted to 1:1000, Santa Cruz Fos antibody 1:500, Dr. Habener’s CREB antibody 1:2000, and phosphoCREB 0.5 μg/ml and secondary antibody, in all cases, 1:5000. Exposure to primary antibody was for 1 h except for phosphoCREB antibody, which required only 30 min. Longer incubation with this antibody results in cross-reactivity with unphosphorylated CREB. The membranes were then washed with 0.1% TTBS three times for 5 min. Secondary antibody was applied for 30 min in all cases. Proteins were detected using ECL according to manufacturer’s directions.

Transient Transfection—Cells were seeded at \(10^6\) cells/100-mm diameter Petri dish and transiently transfected the following day using a calcium phosphate coprecipitation method modified from Rosenthal (20). Briefly, DNA was added to 550 μl of a 0.25 M CaCl₂ solution and mixed dropwise into 550 μl of 2× HEPES buffered salt solution (560 mM NaCl, 100 mM HEPES, 3 mM Na₂HPO₄, pH 7.1) per dish. The solution was added to the media in the culture dishes, which were then incubated in 8% CO₂ for 4 h. Following glycerol shock, the cells were returned to maintenance medium overnight, and then treated with the appropriate agent(s). A preliminary time course indicated that maximal c-fos promoter activity was detectable after 24 h of PTH treatment. Therefore, all treatments were for this duration. To harvest, the cells were washed four times with PBS and scraped into TEN (40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl). The cells were then pelleted by centrifugation (1000 × g, 10 min, 4°C) and resuspended in 150 μl of 0.25 M Tris, pH 8.0. Cell lysis was achieved by three freeze-thaw cycles. Endogenous acetylases were inactivated by incubating samples at 60°C for 10 min (except samples to be assayed for β-galactosidase activity) and debris removed by centrifugation (12,000 × g, 10 min, 4°C). The supernatant was assayed for CAT activity by a modification of the Seed and Sheen (21) procedure. Separate plates were transfected with a β-galactosidase expression plasmid to verify transfection uniformity from experiment to experiment and β-galactosidase activity assayed. Transfection efficiency was so uniform that CAT activities from separate, individual experiments have been pooled and are shown in many figures as mean ± S.E. Background was defined as the activity of pSV0CAT and subtracted from that of the *fos*-CAT constructs. The pSV2CAT plasmid was transfected into separate plates as a positive control in all experiments.

Gel Mobility Shift Assay—Cell lysates were prepared by washing the cell monolayer with PBS and scraping into lysis buffer (buffer C from Dignam et al. (22), plus 100 nM okadaic acid, 100 nM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and 0.5 mM dithiothreitol). Cell debris was removed by brief centrifugation. Lysates (5 μl, approximately 7 μg of protein) were incubated in final volume of 20 μl containing binding buffer (final concentrations: 4% glycerol, 1 mM MgCl₂, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, 50 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5), 100 ng of poly(dI-dC), and antisera or competitor DNA at room temperature for 10 min. Double-stranded, γ-³²P-labeled oligonucleotide was added to the reaction immediately following the above reagents. A preliminary time course demonstrated that protein:DNA interaction occurs instantaneously. Therefore, 2 μl of 10× gel loading dye was added immediately following the probe. The reactions were then applied to a 6% polyacrylamide gel. After electrophoresis in 0.25 mM Tris, 190 mM glycine, 1 mM EDTA running buffer, the gel was dried and complexes were visualized by autoradiography. The sequences of the oligonucleotide probes were as follows, with CREs underlined and mutations in bold.

The Primer Designer program was used to choose flanking sequences for the double-stranded oligonucleotides for mutagenesis.

Site-directed Mutagenesis—Mutant –356 *fos* CAT constructs were generated with the Chameleon double-stranded, site-directed mutagenesis kit (Stratagene) according to manufacturer’s instructions. Mut 1 was created using a 20-mer mutagenesis oligonucleotide complementary to the major CRE-containing region with a single point mutation: 5′-TGGACTTCCCTACTTCACCTGG-3′. As above, the CRE is underlined and the substituted base in bold. Mut 3 was similarly developed with the following oligonucleotide: 5′-GGATGGGACTTCCCTAATGCACGGGGCGGAACCTGG-3′. The selection primer (Stratagene) changed the AlwNI site to NruI.

RESULTS

PTH Increases Fos Protein Levels through a Mechanism That is Dependent on Time, PTH Concentration, and Intracellular cAMP—We have previously demonstrated that the c-fos gene transcription rate and steady state mRNA levels increase in UMR 106-01 cells after PTH treatment in a time- and dose-dependent manner (1). However, Fos protein is the final determinant in AP-1-mediated gene activation. To assess the time course of PTH-induced Fos accumulation, UMR 106-01 cells were treated for the indicated time periods with 10⁻⁸ M PTH (Fig. 1A). Fos protein levels were noticeably elevated after 30 min, becoming maximal by 60 min. The effect was transient with Fos returning to basal levels approximately 2 h after PTH treatment. Previously, work in our laboratory revealed that c-fos mRNA accumulation was dependent on PTH concentration (1). In order to determine whether Fos protein accumulation is in the same PTH dose-dependent manner, UMR cells were treated with media containing the indicated PTH concentrations (Fig. 1B) and Fos protein levels measured. Fos protein accumulation was found to be PTH dose-dependent, with an increase first observed following 10⁻¹⁰ M PTH treatment for 1 h. Maximal stimulation was achieved with 10⁻⁸ M PTH treatment. This relationship is in agreement with that of c-fos mRNA accumulation.

FIG. 2. PTH activation of mouse c-fos-CAT 5' promoter deletion constructs. A, diagram of c-fos-CAT promoter 5' deletion constructs. All base pair positions are relative to the transcriptional start site, which is indicated by an arrow. Promoter regions are linked at position +109 to a CAT reporter gene. Regulatory elements are labeled and include a sis-inducible element (SIE), a serum response element (SRE), a Fos activator protein 1 site (FAP), a glucocorticoid response element (GRE), and several nonconsensus cAMP response elements (CRE). The major CRE is nearest the start site within the large box, while minor CREs are further upstream and distinguished by smaller boxes. Two minor CREs overlap the SRE and FAP sites. B, all constructs described in Fig. 2A were transiently transfected into UMR 106-01 cells and treated with or without PTH (10⁻⁸ M) for 24 h. Activity is expressed as fold stimulation. Basal activity is shown in the inset. C, UMR 106-01 cells were transiently transfected with -71 fos-CAT and treated with the indicated PTH concentrations. The results are shown as CAT activity. D, following transient transfection with -71 and -356 fos-CAT, cells were treated with control medium (C), PTH (10⁻⁸ M), 8-Br-cAMP (5 × 10⁻³ M), or PMA (2.6 × 10⁻⁷ M) either individually or in the indicated combinations. Basal activities in the control groups were 141 ± 32 and 1879 ± 503 pmol/h/mg of protein for the -71 and -356 fos-CAT constructs, respectively. All results are shown as -fold stimulation and represent the mean ± S.E. of four to six separate experiments.

106-01 cells at this site. Proteins in cell lysates from both control and PTH-treated cells bound the mouse major CRE (TGACGTAG), creating an identical shift pattern (Fig. 4). Titration with cold probe demonstrated that a 5-fold molar excess efficiently competed for all protein-DNA complexes, while 25-fold excess oligonucleotide containing a CTF/NF1 element did not. This titration also revealed that the lower shifted band is less efficiently competed for by cold probe, indicating a lower relative affinity than the upper bands. Other experiments revealed that other non-CRE elements (AP-1, GRE, SP-1) were unable to compete (data not shown) for binding.

The unaltered shift pattern following PTH treatment is in agreement with current thinking that CREB binds to the consensus CRE with equal affinity regardless of its phosphorylation state but activates transcription only when phosphorylated (27, 28). To determine if our system fits this model, we

A, schematic diagram of mutant constructs. All components are as depicted in Fig. 2A except for mutations in the major CRE.

included an antibody that interacts with CREB only if the latter is phosphorylated at Ser¹³³ within the PKA consensus phosphorylation site. This antibody supershifted the upper bands only when protein was derived from PTH-treated cells (Fig. 5A). A nondiscriminating anti-CREB antibody supershifted these bands independent of PTH treatment (data not shown). Likewise, phosphorylation without change in CREB protein abundance was confirmed by Western blot. In this experiment, PTH did not alter the total CREB signal as visualized with CREB antibody while phosphoCREB was detected only in PTH-treated cells (Fig. 5B). The band running below the CREB containing complex in gel shift experiments appears to be ATF-1 since it was abolished by antibody to ATF-1. c-Jun antibody had no effect on any protein-DNA complex.

During the course of this study, the rat c-fos promoter region was published (11) and shown to be very similar to the human and mouse promoters. Rat c-fos bears the same nonconsensus major CRE as mouse but with different flanking sequences. Because UMR 106-01 cells are rat-derived, we assayed UMR 106-01 proteins binding to rat fos CRE in its native context. Similar to the mouse sequence, this element bound protein from both control- and PTH-treated UMR 106-01 cells equally, creating a shifted complex that could be supershifted by CREB antibody (data not shown).

**FIG. 4. PTH effect on UMR 106-01 cell protein binding to the mouse major CRE.** UMR 106-01 cells were treated with control medium (C) or PTH (10⁻⁸ M) for 20 min and a cell lysate prepared. Protein binding to a double-stranded 27-mer oligonucleotide, which included the c-fos major CRE, was assessed by gel mobility shift analysis. Three separate experiments were performed with similar results. The fold excess of unlabeled oligonucleotides included in the binding reaction is indicated.

**FIG. 5. PTH effect on CREB phosphorylation.** A, protein from control- and PTH (10⁻⁸ M)-treated UMR cells was subjected to gel mobility shift analysis using mouse c-fos major CRE-containing oligonucleotide probe. Antibodies against phosphorylated CREB (P-CREB), ATF-1, and c-Jun were included in the indicated reactions. B, UMR 106-01 cells were treated with control medium (C) or PTH (10⁻⁸ M) for 20 min, a cell lysate prepared, and subjected to Western blot analysis. The panel on the left was detected with anti-phosphoCREB antibody, the middle panel with anti-CREB antibody, and the right panel with nonimmune rabbit IgG. Results are representative of three separate experiments.

Gel mobility shift experiments, which included a mutant CRE-containing oligonucleotide probe, confirmed the loss of CREB-containing bands (Fig. 6). The mutations were those incorporated into Mut 1 and Mut 3. This experiment confirmed our speculation that a single point mutation within the major CRE allows residual protein binding as determined by overexposing the film (data not shown). Residual CREB interaction with the mutant CREs was inversely proportional to basal expression of Mut 1 and Mut 3 constructs. Conversely, ATF-1 binding was not altered.

The Dominant CREB Inhibitor KCREB Suppresses PTH Induction of Mouse c-fos-CAT Constructs—KCREB (killer CREB) is a dominant inhibitor of CREB function (17). The protein product has an amino acid substitution within the leucine zipper, which results in KCREB-CREB heterodimers with no DNA binding function. We cotransfected a KCREB expression

Cells were lysed and the soluble proteins subjected to gel mobility shift analysis. Probes consist of 27-mer oligonucleotides containing wild type mouse CRE or the mutant CREs, which were incorporated into the constructs described above. Three separate experiments were performed with similar results.

KCREB inhibited PTH-mediated activation of both -71 and -356 fos-CAT promoter constructs by 60% (Fig. 7). Conversely, expression of -56 fos-CAT, which lacks the major CRE as well as PTH responsiveness, was unaffected by KCREB (data not shown).

**DISCUSSION**

The data presented in this work identify three steps in the mechanism through which PTH induces c-fos gene expression in osteoblastic cells. (i) PTH induces c-fos expression using cAMP as a second messenger. (ii) Activated PKA catalytic subunit phosphorylates CREB at Ser¹³³ within the P-box. (iii) Phosphorylated CREB bound to the major CRE in the c-fos 5' regulatory region results in transcriptional activation.

Despite causing increased intracellular calcium and phosphoinositide turnover, PTH induces many osteoblastic responses through cAMP-dependent mechanisms (3). Accordingly, our observation that a cAMP analog mimics the effect of PTH on both c-fos promoter activation and Fos protein accumulation is in agreement with this pattern. In addition, failure of maximal concentrations of 8-Br-cAMP and PTH in combination to significantly increase their effect on c-fos further supports this interpretation. This is because each agent maximally activates the same pathway making additional c-fos expression through this mechanism impossible. Although PMA induced Fos protein both alone and combined with PTH or 8-Br-cAMP, the response was always in excess of the maximal PTH induction. This point, coupled with convincing experiments performed by Clohisy et al. (1), refutes any protein kinase-C involvement in the PTH-induced transduction of c-fos. Therefore, all available evidence identifies cAMP as the major functional second messenger in this and many other PTH-mediated responses in osteoblasts.

We have previously defined PTH-induced c-fos expression as a primary response (1). *De novo* synthesized transcriptional activators are, by definition, not participants in this mechanism. Therefore, post-translational modification must be involved. Partridge et al. (29) have demonstrated PKA activation in response to PTH. These findings combined with the current

FIG. 7. The effect of the dominant inhibitor, KCREB, on PTH activation of the c-fos promoter constructs. KCREB (5 μg) or equimolar vector was cotransfected with the indicated c-fos-CAT construct (5 μg) and treated with control medium or PTH (10⁻⁸ M). All plates were normalized with respect to total DNA mass transfected by the addition of pBluescript DNA. Values represent the mean ± S.E. of three separate experiments. Basal activity is shown (inset). *, statistically significant compared to the same construct without KCREB by one-tailed paired t test (-71 fosCAT, p = 0.0293; -356 fosCAT p = 0.0035)

data are in agreement with the classical CREB-mediated pathway. Specifically, constitutively expressed CREB is phosphorylated at Ser¹³³ by PKA. CREB is then activated, and as a dimer bound to a CRE, can activate gene transcription (for review, see Ref. 30). Our observations that CREB is necessary for the full PTH response coupled with PTH-induced PKA activity and CREB phosphorylation at the PKA consensus site are in complete support of this mechanism. It should be noted that Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinases types II and IV have also been shown to phosphorylate CREB at Ser¹³³. However, we have clearly eliminated calcium involvement in induction of c-fos by PTH (1).

While Ser¹³³ phosphorylation is required for CREB activity, additional kinases may also participate in CREB activation (28). Accordingly, PKA-mediated phosphorylation is required to create a casein kinase II consensus site, which, upon phosphorylation, activates CREB *in vitro* (31). The latter and similar observations involving other kinases have resulted in a hierarchical phosphorylation model (32). This states that, although CREB remains inactive without phosphorylation at the PKA site, the differential action of kinases on additional residues is required for its full activation and allows for cell-specific regulation. In this mechanism, Ser¹³³ phosphorylation may cause a conformational change in the CREB protein, making other phosphorylated residues available for protein-protein interaction or exposing other residues to kinases. Work is currently in progress to identify any additional phosphorylation events that may be part of the PTH-mediated signal transduction pathway in osteoblasts. In fact, we postulate that this mechanism causes the synergism that we observed between PMA and 8-Br-cAMP.

Proteins other than CREB are able to interact with the CRE

sequence. However, this report clearly establishes CREB as one, if not the only, of these factors active and required at the c-fos major CRE. Gel shift assays combined with transfected fos-CAT constructs containing mutant CREs provide the most direct proof. Although ATF-1 interaction with the major CRE was visualized by gel mobility shift, we reject this factor as a candidate for four reasons. (i) ATF-1 binding was not altered by CRE mutations that inhibited PTH induction of -356 c-fos-CAT. (ii) Although the P-CREB antibody cross-reacts with a homologous site on ATF-1, we did not see ATF-1 phosphorylation. (iii) ATF-1 bound the major CRE with a lower affinity than CREB. (iv) No CREB-ATF-1 dimers bound to the major CRE.

CREB activity at the major CRE is in agreement with earlier c-fos promoter characterization, which assigns most of the cAMP-mediated c-fos induction to this element (12). Similar responses of -71 and -356 fos-CAT refute the possibility of other PTH responsive elements 5' to the major CRE. Basal activity accompanying induced promoter activation is also characteristic of the CRE. For example, CREB has been shown to enhance both basal and glucocorticoid-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene expression through a 5' CRE (33).

In summary, we demonstrate that PTH induces c-fos transcription primarily through the cAMP/PKA pathway. This event requires that CREB becomes phosphorylated by PKA at Ser<sup>133</sup> and acts at the major CRE within the c-fos promoter region. This is the first demonstration that PTH induces gene transcription through phosphorylation of a constitutively expressed transcription factor and completes the signaling pathway from the cell membrane to the nucleus.
