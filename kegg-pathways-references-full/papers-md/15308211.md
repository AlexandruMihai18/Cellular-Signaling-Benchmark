Following stimulation, T cells undergo marked actin-dependent changes in shape that are required for productive cellular interactions and movement during immune responses. Reorganization of the actin cytoskeletal is also necessary for the formation of an immunological synapse—the convergence of several signaling molecules at the plasma membrane that occurs after effective T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling. Much emerging evidence indicates that the Tec family of tyrosine kinases has a role in actin cytoskeleton reorganization. Specifically, T cells that lack or express mutant versions of the Tec kinase Itk show impaired TCR-induced actin polymerization, cell polarization and regulation of the signaling events involved in cytoskeletal reorganization. These data, as well as other findings, support roles for Tec kinases in actin cytoskeleton regulation.

About a decade ago, mutations affecting the tyrosine kinase Btk were linked to the human disease X-linked agammaglobulinemia and murine X-linked immunodeficiency [1–3], genetic disorders that are characterized by reduced serum immunoglobulin and defective B cell development and function [4]. Btk is now recognized to be a member of a family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases that includes Tec, Btk, Itk (also known as Emt or Tsk), Bmx or Etk (Bmx/Etk), and Rlk or Txk (Rlk/Txk) [5]. Tec kinases are expressed primarily in cells of the hematopoietic lineage, but Bmx/Etk and Tec are also found in endothelial cells and the liver, respectively [5]. Itk and Rlk/Txk are the primary Tec kinases expressed in T lymphocytes, although expression of Tec is also detected in T cells.

Tec kinases share a similar modular structure with the Src family of non-receptor tyrosine kinases: namely, Src homology domain 2 (SH2) and SH3 protein interaction domains, followed by a tyrosine kinase catalytic domain [5] (Figure 1). However, Tec kinases lack a carboxy (C)-terminal regulatory tyrosine and instead possess two distinctive features: a proline-rich region upstream of the SH3 domain that is involved in intra- and intermolecular regulatory interactions, and an amino (N)-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain that is required for activation. On antigen receptor engagement, activation of the Tec kinases entails two events: first, membrane localization via

interaction of the PH domain with phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃], a product of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K); and second, phosphorylation by a Src family kinase on a conserved tyrosine in the activation loop, resulting in enhanced Tec kinase activity [6] (Figure 2).

Genetic and biochemical studies of mice deficient for Tec kinase have shown that these kinases are required for proper lymphocyte development and function [7,8]. Although Tec kinases are involved in signaling pathways triggered by many different cell-surface receptors [9], analysis of antigen-receptor-mediated pathways has shown that Tec kinases have an important role in the regulation of phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), an enzyme that cleaves phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate [PtdIns(4,5)P₂] into inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate [Ins(1,4,5)P₃], which is required for Ca²⁺ mobilization, and diacylglycerol (DAG), which is required for protein kinase C (PKC) activation (for review, see Ref. [6]) (Figure 3).

On engagement of the T-cell receptor (TCR), rapid activation of Src and Syk family kinases (Lck and ZAP-70, respectively) occurs, leading to phosphorylation of two key adaptor molecules: linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and SH2-domain-containing leukocyte protein of 76 kD (SLP-76; reviewed in Ref. [10]). These two adaptors act as a platform for recruiting signaling intermediates including the adaptors Grb-2, GADS and Nck, the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Vav1, PLC-γ and the Tec kinases. This signaling complex is required to activate downstream pathways that regulate transcription,

Figure 1. Domain structure of Tec family kinases. The Tec kinases are non-receptor tyrosine kinases containing a Src homology domain 3 (SH3), an SH2 domain, a kinase domain and a proline-rich (PR) region. Some members also possess a region of homology to Btk and RasGAP (BH) as part of a Tec homology (TH) module with the PR region. The N-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain is unique to this family of tyrosine kinases and aids in recruitment to the plasma membrane. Rlk/Txk lacks this domain and instead has a palmitoylated cysteine string motif (Cys). The primary Tec kinases expressed in T cells are Itk and Rlk/Txk, but some Tec is also expressed. The structure of Src family kinases is shown for comparison. U denotes a unique domain and Y denotes a negative regulatory tyrosine.

the maturing oocyte. This phenotype is also observed in mutants lacking the *Drosophila* homolog of Src, Src 64, which interacts with Tec 29 and can regulate its localization [19]. Thus, in the invertebrate *Drosophila*, a Tec kinase is required for proper formation of an actin-based structure.

In mammalian systems, various experimental approaches have shown that Tec kinases localize to actin-rich regions of the cell. In transient transfection studies, a chimera comprising Btk and green fluorescent protein (GFP) translocated to the plasma membrane on stimulation through the insulin receptor or the G-protein-coupled chemokine receptor CXCR4 [20]. The translocated Btk was found predominantly in regions of the membrane referred to as ‘membrane ruffles’ or ‘lamellipodia’, which are formed by the polymerization of actin. Transient overexpression of Itk in Jurkat cells also leads to an increase in membrane ruffling (see Figure 4 in Ref. [21]). In platelets, activation of the thrombin receptor causes Btk to translocate to cytoskeletal fractions with a concomitant disappearance of the protein from the Triton-soluble fraction [22]. This effect has been found to be regulated by the integrin αIIbβ3 and is dependent on PI3K activity and actin polymerization. Finally, filamentous actin (F-actin) has been shown to associate directly with basic residues in the N-terminal part of a fusion protein comprising the Btk PH domain and glutathione S-transferase [23]. Thus, direct associations between Tec kinases and the actin cytoskeleton have been established.

Tec kinases and TCR-driven actin polymerization

On TCR engagement with antigen and antigen-presenting cells (APCs) or with beads coated with antibodies specific for the TCR (anti-TCR), the T cell becomes polarized with a rapid accumulation of F-actin at the site of stimulation (Figures 3,4). Over the course of 10 min to 1 h, there occurs an actin-dependent accumulation of cell-surface receptors and intracellular signaling intermediates into an organized structure, the immune synapse, with distinct zones of signaling molecules at the contact site between the T cell and the APC [24].

Several recent reports argue that the Tec kinase Itk is specifically required for this TCR-induced reorganization of actin. The expression of Itk mutants in the Jurkat cell line prevents actin polymerization and polarization on stimulation through the TCR complex [15,16]. In primary T cells from *Itk⁻/⁻* mice, defects in TCR-driven actin polarization and polymerization have been observed on incubation with either antigen-pulsed APCs or anti-TCR-coated latex beads [14,15]. Indeed, Itk-deficient cells show almost no increase in actin polarization in response to antigen [14], suggesting that their defect in actin reorganization is more severe than their partial defects in Ca²⁺ mobilization. Consistent with this actin defect, an abnormal recruitment of molecules associated with the immune synapse, including PKC-θ, Talin and the LFA-1 integrin, is observed in Itk-deficient T cells (L.D. Finkelstein and P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished). Thus, Itk seems to be essential for actin cytoskeleton reorganization downstream of the TCR.

Figure 3. T-cell receptor (TCR) signaling to cytoskeleton. On stimulation of the TCR, rapid activation of intracellular tyrosine kinases occurs, followed by the subsequent accumulation of signaling molecules at the plasma membrane into a multicomponent complex, which is nucleated by the adaptors LAT and SLP-76 and includes Tec kinases, phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ), the adaptors Grb-2, GADS and Nck, and the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Vav1. This complex is essential for transducing signals that regulate Ca²⁺ mobilization, mitogen-activation protein kinase activation, transcriptional activation, actin reorganization and cellular adhesion. The Tec kinases are known to be important in the activation of PLC-γ; however, recent evidence suggests that they also participate in actin reorganization by contributing to regulation of Vav1 localization and downstream activation of Rho family GTPases.

Potential role of WASP

In T cells, an essential component of actin signaling is the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) – the gene product affected in Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, an X-linked hereditary immunodeficiency characterized by abnormal T cell cytoskeletal organization [25]. WASP gets recruited to the immune synapse via interactions of its proline-rich domain with SH3-domain-containing proteins such as Nck and PSTPIP1 [26–28]. On binding of the WASP GTPase-binding domain (GBD) to the activated GTP-bound version of the Rho family GTPase Cdc42, WASP assumes an open conformation and can activate the Arp2/3 complex, which in turn promotes the nucleation of new actin filaments [29]. Recent data also suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation can activate WASP and is essential for the ability of WASP to promote actin polymerization in T cells [30,31]. Indeed, one study argues that tyrosine

Figure 4. T cells polarize their actin cytoskeleton on stimulation. On engagement of a T cell with antigen on an antigen-presenting cell (APC), the T cell undergoes a marked reorganization of its actin cytoskeleton to polarize towards the site of stimulation (filamentous actin detected by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin).

phosphorylation can activate WASP independently of Cdc 42 binding [30].

Interactions between WASP and the Tec kinases have been demonstrated in several systems. The SH3 domain of Itk has been shown to bind to the proline-rich region of WASP *in vitro* [32]. Other studies have demonstrated that Btk can also physically interact with and phosphorylate WASP [33,34]. Thus, WASP seemed to be a good candidate for mediating cytoskeletal regulation via Itk. Indeed, although WASP seemed to be recruited normally in pre-activated *Itk⁻/⁻* T cells conjugated to antigen-pulsed APCs, a decrease in the binding of an antibody that specifically detects the open conformation of WASP was observed in these cells [14]. Moreover, by using a fusion protein comprising GFP and the WASP GBD as a sensor for detecting activated GTP-bound Cdc42 by fluorescence microscopy, the same study has shown that localized activation of Cdc42 is defective in *Itk⁻/⁻* T cells stimulated with antigen and APCs.

By contrast, another recent study has detected normal levels of TCR-induced WASP tyrosine phosphorylation in T cells from Itk-deficient mice, suggesting that WASP activation could be normal in Itk-deficient cells [30]. Although the relative contributions of Cdc42 binding and tyrosine phosphorylation to WASP activation in T lymphocytes remain controversial, these data argue that the defect in actin polarization in Itk-deficient cells does not result from a direct effect on WASP, but rather from an upstream effect of Itk on Cdc42 activation. These studies support the idea that the regulation of WASP by Cdc42 and its regulation by tyrosine phosphorylation could be uncoupled.

**Role of Vav1**

The abnormal activation of Cdc42 in Itk-deficient T cells argues that Itk functions at a more proximal stage in pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton. A potential molecule of interest in these pathways is the GEF Vav1, which is rapidly tyrosine phosphorylated on TCR engagement and facilitates the exchange of GDP for GTP on the Rho family GTPases Rac, Rho, and Cdc42, thereby activating them [35]. Vav1 proteins can also act as adaptor molecules that interact with various signaling proteins via their multidomain structure.

Vav1-deficient T cells show defective activation of both Rac and Cdc42 [27,36], and these cells are also defective in TCR-mediated actin polymerization [37]. Moreover, Vav1-deficient T cells seem to have more severe phenotypes than those of WASP-deficient T cells; they show impaired TCR-mediated activation of integrin adhesion and clustering of the LFA-1 integrin—actin-dependent defects that are not observed in WASP-deficient cells [38] and might reflect the activity of Vav1 as a GEF for several Rho family members. Recently, a TCR-mediated Vav1/Rac-dependent pathway that dephosphorylates ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins has been described and proposed to promote conjugate formation between T cells and APCs by decreasing cellular rigidity [39]. Taken together, these data highlight the importance of Vav1 in signaling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton.

A link between Vav1 and Tec kinases was first observed on stimulation of cells with interleukin-3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin, which resulted in Vav1 binding to the Tec homology domain of Tec [40]. When coexpressed in COS-1 cells, Vav1 and Tec associate with one another and Tec enhances the GEF activity of Vav1 towards Rac [41]. Furthermore, studies have shown that Vav1 does not localize properly to the contact site between the T cell and the antigen-pulsed APC in *Itk⁻/⁻* T cells [14], despite relatively normal TCR-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of Vav1 [42]. These data suggest that the role of Itk in actin cytoskeleton reorganization might involve regulating the localized activation of Vav1. Indeed, the expression of a prenylated, membrane-targeted mutant of Vav1 can rescue the actin polarization defect in cells in which Itk expression has been disrupted by short interfering RNA (R.A. Houghtling and P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished), further supporting the idea that Vav1 has a major role in Tec kinase signaling pathways. Notably, however, another recent study has shown that Itk activation is also abnormal in Vav1-deficient T cells, highlighting the complex cross-regulation of proteins involved in the TCR signaling complex [36].

How Itk contributes to the regulation of Vav1 localization is unclear. A recent study has shown that Itk can help to phosphorylate the adaptor molecule LAT and to promote Vav1-LAT binding (*Figure 3*), which could facilitate the recruitment of Vav1 to the contact site between T cells and APCs [43]. Data regarding the requirement for Itk kinase activity in TCR-mediated actin polymerization are, however, conflicting [15,16]. Indeed, whereas reports vary on the ability of kinase-inactive Itk mutants to block TCR-induced actin polymerization, a recent study has shown that an Itk mutant in which the function of the SH2 domain is altered can efficiently block this process [15]. Thus, an SH2-mediated function of Itk might be involved in the regulation of Vav1 localization. Notably, therefore, both Itk and Vav1 can bind via their SH2 domains to the SLP-76 adaptor protein, which, along with LAT, helps to nucleate the signaling complex required for TCR signaling [44] (*Figure 3*). Whether Itk alters the interaction of Vav1 with a protein in this signaling complex awaits further experimental investigation.

The regulation of Vav1 by Itk suggests that the phenotypes of Itk-deficient cells might not only arise from biochemical defects in PLC-γ activation. Indeed, many of the phenotypes of Itk-deficient T cells (impaired thymic selection, altered CD4/CD8 ratios, and decreased cytokine production and proliferation [13,42,45,46]) might be accounted for by a decrease in the duration of signaling, which could result from a decrease in actin polarization and the downstream consequences for integrin-mediated adhesion (see below). Moreover, many of the biochemical defects in Itk-deficient T cells are similar to those observed in Vav1-deficient T cells [47]. Whether similar defects contribute to the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with X-linked agammaglobulinemia remains to be seen.

**Tec kinases and integrin adhesion**

On antigen receptor stimulation of T cells, cellular adhesion via integrin receptors is rapidly upregulated by
a poorly understood mechanism known as ‘inside-out signaling’—a process that depends on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton. Indeed, cells deficient in Vav1 have been shown to have defective TCR-induced integrin-mediated adhesion [38]. Given the proposed function of Itk in regulating Vav1 localization, it is interesting that a role for Itk has been also established in TCR-mediated activation of β1 integrins [16]. This study has shown that β1-integrin-mediated adhesion of Jurkat T cells requires the activation and recruitment of Itk, via its PH domain, to detergent-insoluble glycosphingolipid-enriched micro-domains. In addition, *Itk*⁻/⁻ T cells show defective conjugate formation with an antigen-pulsed APC [14] and a decrease in TCR-induced upregulation of integrin-mediated adhesion (L.D. Finkelstein and P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished). Similarly, Btk is required for B cell antigen receptor control of β1 integrin adhesion by a process involving cytoskeletal reorganization [48]. Taken together, these results suggest that Tec kinases might provide an essential link between antigen receptors and the upregulation of adhesive interactions.

In T cells, it is likely that Tec kinases participate in cell adhesion through their effects on Vav1; however, they could also contribute to inside-out activation of integrins via other signaling molecules. Members of the PKC family of serine/threonine kinases help to regulate both the actin cytoskeleton and integrin-mediated adhesion. Although it is not yet known how the PKC family contributes to integrin regulation in T cells, much evidence indicates that Tec kinases contribute to the regulation of PKCs. Membrane recruitment of PKC, a crucial step for activation, requires DAG, one of the products of PLC-γ and a known downstream effector of the Tec kinases in antigen receptor signaling. Studies with the PH domain of Btk have shown that it can also interact directly with several PKC isoforms including PKC-ξ [49], which physically associates with the actin cytoskeleton and is involved in maintaining its integrity [50].

More recently, an interaction between Btk and PKC-θ has been found in platelets, where PKC-θ phosphorylates Btk on threonine and Btk subsequently phosphorylates PKC-θ on tyrosine to downregulate its activity [51]. In T cells, the PKC-θ isoform is an essential component of the immune synapse [52], a structure that is dependent on the actin cytoskeleton. In addition, PKC-θ is required for the formation of actin stress fibers in vascular endothelial cells, suggesting that this novel PKC can also contribute to cytoskeletal organization [53]. Itk-deficient T cells show abnormal recruitment of PKC-θ to the contact site with an anti-TCR-coated bead (L.D. Finkelstein and P.L. Schwartzberg, unpublished). Although this defect in PKC-θ recruitment in *Itk*⁻/⁻ cells might be secondary to the defective localization of Vav1, which is known to be required for PKC-θ localization, direct effects on PKC isoforms might provide an additional connection between Tec kinases and the cytoskeleton.

Another potential link between Tec kinases and pathways regulating adhesion is the adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor protein (ADAP; also known as SLAP-130 or Fyb), a binding partner of SLP-76. Two recent studies have shown that ADAP is involved in

coupling the TCR to integrin activation [54,55], and the ADAP-associated protein SKAP-55 also regulates T-cell adhesion [56]. In T cells the Itk SH3 and SH2 domains interact with SLP-76, and in B cells Btk can interact with the SLP adaptor protein SLP-65 [32,57]. Furthermore, the Tec kinase Rlk/Txk has been shown to phosphorylate SLP-76 on tyrosine in T cells [58]. Nonetheless, it has not yet been determined whether Itk directly affects ADAP function nor whether ADAP and Itk function in the same or in distinct pathways that affect adhesion. Similarly, the small GTPase Rap1 is required for actin-cytoskeleton-dependent TCR-induced adhesion via its effector RapL, which associates with the α chain of the LFA-1 integrin at the outer part of the immune synapse on TCR stimulation [59,60]. Again, a link between the Rap1/RapL and Itk-dependent pathways has not been established.

In addition to modulating the upregulation of integrin adhesion, Tec kinases might also contribute to signaling pathways triggered by integrins. Similar to inside-out signaling, these ‘outside-in’ pathways also involve regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. On engagement of integrins, focal adhesion kinase (FAK) can bind the PH domain of the Tec kinase Bmx/Etk and increase Bmx kinase activity [61]. This interaction involves the FAK FERM domain (a domain shared with Four.1 and the ERM cytoskeletal proteins), a protein module that links cytoplasmic proteins to the membrane. In addition, kinase-inactive Bmx/Etk can block integrin-mediated migration. A separate study has shown that Bmx/Etk interacts with the docking protein p130Cas (Cas) at membrane ruffles, which are sites of active actin reorganization [62]. Bmx/Etk phosphorylates Cas and enhances the formation of a Cas-Crk complex that is necessary for inducing integrin-mediated cytoskeletal changes and cell motility. Thus, signaling via Tec kinases might regulate the actin cytoskeleton both upstream and downstream of integrin receptors.

### Contribution of Tec kinases to signaling via phosphoinositides

A novel potential link between Tec kinases and actin regulatory proteins comes from a recent study demonstrating an interaction between Btk and phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate 5-kinase (PtdIns4P 5-kinase), which generates a potential positive feedback loop in antigen receptor signaling. This study suggests that Btk activates PtdIns4P 5-kinase downstream of antigen receptors by recruiting it to the plasma membrane, where it can generate more PtdIns(4,5)P₂—a substrate of both PI3K and PLC-γ [63]. PI3K acts on PtdIns(4,5)P₂ to produce PtdIns(3,4,5)P₃, which can further activate PH-domain-containing proteins such as Btk, whereas PLC-γ, which is a downstream target of Btk kinase activity, converts PtdIns(4,5)P₂ into Ins(1,4,5)P₃ and DAG. Thus, this activation of PtdIns4P 5-kinase provides a potential positive regulatory loop for amplifying Ca²⁺- and DAG-mediated signals. Notably, however, PtdIns(4,5)P₂ can also bind to and regulate components of the actin cytoskeleton machinery including WASP, α-actinin, gelso-lin and profilin [64].
Because Btk and Itk operate similarly downstream of antigen receptors, it is possible that Itk might also help to recruit PtdIns4P 5-kinase to the site of TCR activation by the APC and thereby contribute to the localized accumulation of F-actin. How Ca²⁺ might further contribute to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by the Tec kinases remains to be evaluated.

Role of Tec kinases in chemokine-induced responses

We have concentrated on the role of Tec kinases in antigen-receptor-mediated reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton. Evidence indicates, however, that G-protein signaling pathways also use Tec kinases for effecting cytoskeletal changes. Activation of the Tec kinase Bmx/Etk results in activation of the serum response factor via the small GTPase Rho, although whether Rho affects the cytoskeleton in this pathway remains unclear [65]. Bmx/Etk can also activate the p21-activated kinase PAK, another signaling molecule that has been shown to participate in pathways targeting the actin cytoskeleton [66].

In lymphocytes, another major series of G-protein-coupled receptors that regulate the actin cytoskeleton are the chemokine receptors. Chemokines are small peptides that activate Gi/o-protein-coupled receptors, leading to cell polarization and migration. Stimulation of chemokine receptors can lead to membrane localization of Btk, Bmx/Etk and Itk [20,67,68]. Recently, the chemoattractant f-Met-Leu-Phe has been shown to induce both translocation and activation of Tec in neutrophils, and a Btk inhibitor has been found to block neutrophil responses to this chemoattractant [67,69]. Similarly, the chemokine SDF-1α can induce membrane localization and phosphorylation of Itk on tyrosine, and T cells deficient in the two Tec kinases Itk and Rlk/Txk show impaired chemokine-induced migration [68,70].

Mutants of Itk also block chemokine-induced cell polarization and activation of Cdc42 and Rac, providing evidence that Tec kinases have a role in regulating Rho family GTPases downstream of both chemokine and antigen receptors [68]. Thus, several triggers might activate signaling pathways that use Tec kinases to modulate the activation of Rho family GTPases and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton (Figure 5). Whether altered regulation of Vav1 or another GEF contributes to these phenotypes remains an intriguing issue. The GEF Dock2 has been shown to be involved in both TCR and chemokine responses in T lymphocytes [71,72]. However, because Dock2-deficient cells do not show defects in TCR-induced recruitment of PKC-θ and LFA-1, Itk-deficient cells seem to resemble more closely cells lacking Vav1, at least in terms of TCR signaling defects.

Conclusion

Cytoskeletal rearrangements mediated by the TCR are crucial for effective T-cell activation including proliferation, cytokine production, formation of the immunological synapse, increased cell adhesion via integrin receptors and cell motility. Over the past few years, our understanding of TCR-mediated actin cytoskeleton dynamics has grown exponentially. Studies have shown

that numerous molecules, from kinases to adaptor proteins, contribute to the signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal rearrangement downstream of the TCR. In this review we have focused on the Tec family of tyrosine kinases, specifically Itk, and its role in the organization and maintenance of the actin cytoskeleton on TCR stimulation. It is clear, however, that Tec kinases also participate in signaling pathways that regulate the actin cytoskeleton downstream of other receptors, including G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors and integrins, which also have key roles in the functional responses of T cells. Whether the Tec kinases regulate similar signaling intermediates downstream of these diverse receptors will be an exciting new area of study.

Genetic studies in Drosophila originally implicated Tec kinases in regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Similar links were subsequently discovered in mammalian systems, primarily on the basis of the translocation of Tec kinases to actin-rich membrane structures. It is, however, only recently that the essential role of the Tec kinase Itk has been described in TCR-mediated actin cytoskeleton rearrangement and cell adhesion. These findings have significantly expanded our current knowledge of Itk function in T cells; moreover, they suggest that the phenotypes of Itk-deficient cells might not only arise from biochemical defects in PLC-γ activation [15]. Indeed, many of the specific phenotypes associated with Itk deficiency could be accounted for by a decrease in the duration of signaling, which could result from a decrease in actin polarization that impairs the stable accumulation of signaling molecules and alters integrin-mediated adhesion to APCs. How defective cytoskeletal responses contribute to immune defects in Itk-deficient mice and whether similar defects contribute to the cellular and developmental phenotypes associated with Btk deficiency in X-linked agammaglobulinemia remain important issues.

Although these studies have further advanced our understanding of the TCR-stimulated pathways leading to actin cytoskeletal changes, the mechanisms by which Itk regulates TCR-induced actin cytoskeleton rearrangement have yet to be explored. Itk seems to regulate localization of the GEF Vav1 and activation of the Rho family GTPases, but how it accomplishes these tasks remains unclear. Of interest are whether and how Itk can directly bind Vav1, and whether Itk influences the interaction of Vav1 with other signaling proteins, particularly those that are part of signaling complexes downstream of the TCR. Data suggest that Itk could contribute to regulation of the cytoskeleton at several levels, including modulation of PKCs, Ca²⁺ mobilization, phosphoinositide metabolism and potentially other GEFs. How and whether such pathways also contribute to the role of Itk in TCR-mediated integrin adhesion and whether additional molecules are affected, including ADAP and Rap1, also remain to be explored.

Finally, an important area is whether Itk affects similar signaling intermediates downstream of both chemokine receptors and the TCR. Recent data suggest that several molecules that were previously thought to be specifically involved in TCR signaling, including ZAP-70 and SLP-76, as well as Itk, are also required for effective responses to

Figure 5. Tec family kinases contribute to signaling pathways downstream of multiple cell-surface receptors. Tec kinases are activated by several cell-surface receptors including antigen receptors [the T-cell receptor (TCR) and surface immunoglobulin], G-protein-coupled receptors, integrins and growth factor receptors. Downstream molecules affected by the Tec kinases include phospholipase C-γ (PLC-γ) and actin cytoskeleton regulatory proteins such as the guanine-nucleotide-exchange factor (GEF) Vav1, Rho family GTPases (Rac, Rho and Cdc42) and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP), leading to the activation of many downstream cellular functions. In addition to Ca²⁺ mobilization and gene expression, it is now clear that Tec kinases are important regulators of actin cytoskeleton reorganization, which influences cell adhesion and motility in T cells. Abbreviations: DAG, diacylglycerol; Ins(1,4,5)P₃, inositol (1,4,5)-trisphosphate; PI3Ks, phosphoinositide 3-kinases; PKC, protein kinase C.

chemokines [68,73]. Such data raise the possibility that many signaling pathways converge on common downstream signaling intermediates to amplify cellular responses.

In conclusion, although many issues are still unresolved concerning the mechanism by which Tec kinases control cytoskeletal rearrangement and its consequences for lymphocyte activation, the recent demonstration that Itk is essential for TCR- and chemokine-mediated regulation of Rho GTPases and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton has advanced our understanding of the signals that regulate the actin cytoskeleton and the roles of Tec kinases in lymphocyte function.

### Note added in proof

We would like to draw the attention of the readers to another article highlighting the controversy over the requirement for Itk kinase activity in TCR-mediated actin polymerization: Donnadieu, E. *et al.* (2001) Differential roles of Lck and Itk in T cell response to antigen recognition revealed by calcium imaging and electron microscopy. *J Immunol.* 166, 5540–5549. A second article provides evidence of a mechanism by which Ca²⁺ can regulate the actin cytoskeleton and adhesion through the control of a Calpain-like enzyme: Stewart, M.P. *et al.* (1998) LFA-1-mediated adhesion is regulated by cytoskeletal restraint and by a Ca²⁺-dependent protease, calpain. *J Cell Biol.* 140, 699–707.
