# The Power of the Dark Side: Huntington’s Disease Protein and p53 Form a Deadly Alliance

A role for apoptotic mediators in neurodegenerative disease has long been considered, but the identity of the putative effectors and the basis of their actions in neurodegeneration remain ill-defined. Huntington’s disease (HD) is a polyglutamine disorder whose pathogenesis likely involves mitochondrial dysfunction. In this issue of *Neuron*, Bae et al. present data implicating p53 in HD pathogenesis. This intriguing study may thus provide a link between nuclear transcription dysregulation and mitochondrial abnormalities in HD.

A major challenge in the study of neurodegenerative disease is to reconcile the gradual process of neuronal dysfunction with the rapid nature of classic programmed cell death pathways proposed to account for neuronal loss. Indeed, while there is considerable evidence for activation of apoptotic pathways and mediators of apoptosis in Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and Huntington’s disease (HD) (*Yuan and Yankner, 2000*), sorting out the relative roles of the different players has been a complicated task. For the polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders, of which HD has been the most extensively studied, much of the work has focused upon recruitment of downstream mediators (caspases) and how their activation promotes polyQ neurodegeneration. Thus, an elusive question has been the identity of the upstream mediators and the nature of their actions. In this issue of *Neuron*, a research group led by Dr. Akira Sawa provides compelling evidence of a role for p53 in HD pathogenesis in a study that attempts to link HD’s nuclear pathology with its pronounced mitochondrial abnormalities (*Bae et al., 2005*).

HD is one of nine inherited polyQ diseases characterized by the production of an abnormally folded protein that exerts its toxicity in large part through a gain-of-function effect upon cellular pathways (*Zoghbi and Orr, 2000*). Each polyQ disorder varies in its pattern of neuronal dysfunction, despite widespread overlapping expression of the different disease proteins throughout the central nervous system. HD displays autosomal-dominant inheritance, and affected patients typically present in adulthood with involuntary dance-like movements that progress to involve severe cognitive decline. The disorder worsens over the course of 10–25 years, until patients ultimately succumb to the disease. At present, there are no effective treatments. For many of the polyQ diseases, the misfolded polyQ-expanded protein cannot be efficiently degraded and traffics to the nucleus where it accumulates to form inclusion bodies. Since amino-terminal proteolytic cleavage of the HD polyQ disease protein is well documented, HD cell culture and animal models often employ such amino-terminal truncated proteins, as this typically accelerates

the pathogenic cascade and facilitates dissection of the involved pathways.

In the Bae et al. study, the authors hypothesized that p53 might be involved in HD and proceeded to test this hypothesis. The rationale for their choice of p53 deserves consideration. p53 is an extremely important protein—a classic tumor suppressor poised to respond to a variety of cellular stresses that occur in abnormal cells, and upon detection of the cellular stress, initiate a series of events that either rectifies the problem or culminates in apoptosis (*Vousden, 2000*). The importance of p53's anticancer function in cycling cells is well established. Indeed, inherited heterozygous mutation of p53 predisposes to Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a disorder characterized by multiple independent primary malignancies typically beginning in childhood or adolescence. Although mostly studied in the context of cancer, recognition that p53 is a central factor in cellular stress response has brought it to the attention of neuroscientists. Elevated p53 has been detected in brain tissue from patients diagnosed with neurodegenerative diseases. For example, patients with Alzheimer’s disease show increased p53 immunoreactivity in morphologically damaged neurons, consistent with the presence of increased p53 in neurons from mice overexpressing β-amyloid peptide (Aβ-1-42) (*LaFerla et al., 1996*). Motor neuron degeneration observed in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis has been associated with increased levels of p53 in motor neurons of the spinal cord and motor cortex (*Martin, 2000*).

The p53 tumor suppressor is a sequence-specific transcription factor that induces a biological response largely through the transactivation of specific target genes, although it also possesses repressor activity. Besides its well-described transactivation-dependent effects, p53 may regulate apoptosis through transactivation-independent pathways, although the basis of such effects remains controversial (*Schuler and Green, 2005*). Regardless of its mode of action, the net result of p53 activation is to alter the permeability of the outer mitochondrial membrane. The ability of p53 to induce mitochondrial dysfunction made it an appealing candidate for involvement in HD, since numerous lines of independent investigation have consistently pinpointed the mitochondria as a prominent target in disease pathogenesis. In 1993, it was reported that chronic administration of a mitochondrial toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid, resulted in a selective loss of medium spiny neurons in the striatum (*Beal et al., 1993*). Follow-up studies performed upon HD patient material have documented significant reductions in the enzymatic activities of complexes II, III, and IV of the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation pathway in caudate and putamen—the regions of the brain principally affected in HD, while not detecting such alterations in HD cerebellum or fibroblasts (*Tabrizi et al., 1999*). These provocative findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to HD pathogenesis and could perhaps account for the cell-type specificity in this neurodegenerative disorder.

The Sawa group began its evaluation of p53 by determining if mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt) affected p53 metabolism and function ([Bae et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.04.019)). They found evidence for a direct interaction between Htt and p53 and observed a striking upregulation of p53 protein levels both in PC12 cells expressing mutant Htt and in the brains of HD transgenic mice. Brain regions in HD patients showing elevated levels of p53 matched the regional and cellular selectivity of HD neuropathology. The authors demonstrated that the Htt-p53 binding interaction was enhanced by expansion of the polyQ tract and noted increased p53 promoter-reporter activation in the presence of polyQ-expanded Htt in both PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons. Several downstream targets of p53, Bax and PUMA, were upregulated in PC12 cells expressing Htt. They next examined the functional consequences of the Htt-p53 interaction by measuring mitochondrial membrane depolarization in their PC12 cell model, in HD patient lymphoblasts, and in p53 null primary cortical neurons transfected with Htt expression constructs. These studies yielded dramatic evidence for the role of p53 in producing mitochondrial membrane abnormalities, as treatment of PC12 cells and patient lymphoblasts with the p53 inhibitor pifithrin-α rescued depolarization in each experiment and absence of p53 was completely protective. Bae et al. then chose to evaluate the effects of p53 in two animal models of HD—a *Drosophila* model and the N171 mouse model—by crossing the HD flies and mice onto a p53 null genetic background. In both cases, they documented significant amelioration of the neurodegenerative phenotype. By presenting such a broad portfolio of consistent experimental results, the authors made a convincing case that p53 is involved in HD disease progression (Figure 1).

As compelling as the Bae et al. study is, many unanswered questions regarding the role of p53 in HD and more broadly in other neurological diseases remain. Bae et al.’s observation of a direct binding interaction between Htt and p53 corroborates previous work ([Steffan et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/35005083)). In the earlier study, however, polyQ-expanded Htt repressed transcription in a p53-dependent and p53-independent manner. As the authors of the current study point out, such Htt-mediated repression may reflect the use of a nonneuronal cell line, although Htt-mediated repression of p53-regulated promoters was also observed in differentiated PC12 cells in that study ([Steffan et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1038/35005083)). One intriguing aspect of the Bae et al. work is the pronounced upregulation of p53 levels in HD cells, and their finding that this is occurring not at the level of transcription but likely posttranslationally. What might the basis of this be? If the effect is specific to HD, then it should not result from a general impairment of ubiquitin-proteasome function (assumed to be a common feature of polyQ diseases), although Htt binding to p53 could selectively alter p53 interactions with molecules such as MDM2, a key regulator of p53 degradation. Consequently, identification of the protein domains that mediate binding between p53 and Htt could have therapeutic implications for disrupting p53 activation in HD, especially since knocking down p53 is likely to be laden with too many potentially dangerous side effects to be feasible. Another issue that deserves consideration is the specific-

In the Bae et al. study, the authors hypothesized that p53 might be involved in linking the nuclear pathology of HD with mitochondrial dysfunction. They found evidence for a direct interaction between Htt and p53 and demonstrated that the Htt-p53 binding interaction was enhanced with expansion of the polyQ tract (Htt-polyQ). Their results support a role for p53 activation in HD pathogenesis. Here we see a model outlining the potential pathways by which Htt-polyQ activation of p53 may result in mitochondrial dysfunction. As increased p53 promoter-reporter activation in the presence of polyQ-expanded Htt in both PC12 cells and primary cortical neurons was noted and several downstream targets of p53 were upregulated in Htt-expressing PC12 cells, interaction of Htt-polyQ with p53 likely produces mitochondrial abnormalities in a transcription-dependent fashion. p53 may also promote mitochondrial dysfunction through a transcription-independent pathway that could involve a direct action at the mitochondrial outer membrane, although evidence for such an effect in the Bae et al. study was not found.

ity of p53 involvement in HD pathogenesis. While the authors show that polyQ-expanded ataxin-1 does not affect p53 transactivation and an earlier study of p53 modulation of SCA1 disease in mice yielded moderate effects upon Purkinje cell morphology but without functional improvement or increased cellular survival ([Shahbazian et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0896-6273(01)00273-8)), the role of p53 as a modifier in other polyQ diseases should be more carefully evaluated.

Finally, Bae et al. document impaired mitochondrial complex IV function in HD transgenic mice, which was partially restored by systemic treatment with a p53 inhibitor. It is presently unknown if p53 can disrupt mitochondrial function in the absence of apoptosis in non-neuronal cells, but this finding suggests that p53 can do so in neurons, since neuronal cell death is not evident in this mouse model. Further studies investigating the basis of this effect, perhaps focusing on coordinately upregulated downstream targets of p53, may yield insights into how this is occurring. These results also raise another important question: how could p53 promote neuronal dysfunction but not apoptosis in the context of neurodegeneration? One possibility may relate to the finding that p53 is required for the induction of caspase activity following genotoxic damage ([Johnson et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-4)). Sublethal accumulation of DNA damage resulting from chronic oxidative stress could act-

ivate p53 to a level that promotes the transcription of genes that are required for the localized activation of caspases in axons or dendrites subjected to extensive stimulation by excitatory neurotransmitters. This might lead to localized “synaptic cell death” and dendritic thinning. p53 is reportedly present in synapses where it has been suggested to mediate mitochondrial dysfunction and synaptic degeneration in response to DNA damage, oxidative stress, and excitotoxic insults ([Gilman et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2005.06.023)). Clearly, additional studies will be required to fully evaluate the role of p53 in HD and other neurological disorders, since other disease proteins may find the draw of p53’s dark side impossible to resist.
