### ABSTRACT

A key enzyme in the biosynthesis of clinically important  
aminoglycoside antibiotics is 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose syn-  
thase (DOIS), which catalyzes carbocycle formation  
from D-glucose-6-phosphate to 2-deoxy-scyllo-inosose  
through a multistep reaction. This reaction mechanism  
is similar to the catalysis by dehydroquinate synthase  
(DHQS) of the cyclization of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heputu-  
losonate-7-phosphate to dehydroquinate in the shiki-  
mate pathway, but significant dissimilarity between  
these enzymes is also known, particularly in the stereo-  
chemistry of the phosphate elimination reaction and the  
cyclization. Here, the crystal structures of DOIS from  
Bacillus circulans and its complex with the substrate  
analog inhibitor carbaglucose-6-phosphate, NAD⁺, and  
Co²⁺ have been determined to provide structural  
insights into the reaction mechanism. The complex  
structure shows that an active site exists between the N-  
terminal and C-terminal domains and that the inhibi-  
tor coordinates a cobalt ion in this site. Two subunits  
exist as a dimer in the asymmetric unit. The two active  
sites of the dimer were observed to be different. One  
contains a dephosphorylated compound derived from  
the inhibitor and the other includes the inhibitor with-  
out change. The present study suggested that phosphate  
elimination proceeds through syn-elimination assisted  
by Glu 243 and the aldol condensation proceeds via a  
boat conformation. Also discussed are significant simi-  
larities and dissimilarities between DOIS and DHQS,  
particularly in terms of the structure at the active site  
and the reaction mechanism.

### INTRODUCTION

2-Deoxystreptamine (DOS)-containing aminoglycoside anti-  
biotics including neomycin, kanamycin, gentamicin, and ribos-  
tamycin are clinically important antibacterial agents.$^{1,2}$ Im-  
provement of these antibiotics has been a subject of intensive  
study for a long time. An important biochemical approach to  
this end has involved mutasynthesis or mutational biosynthesis,  
utilizing idirotrophic mutants of producing strains and supple-  
mentation by appropriate analogs of biosynthetic intermedi-  
ates.$^{1,2}$ The chemical pathways from D-glucose to DOS and  
ultimately the antibiotics have been successfully elucidated,  
mostly through isotope-tracer studies;$^{3-6}$ however, the biosyn-  
thetic enzymes and relevant genes have not been characterized  
until recently.

2-Deoxy-scyllo-inosose (DOI) synthase (DOIS) is a key  
enzyme in the biosynthesis of DOS and catalyzes the cycliza-  
tion of D-glucose-6-phosphate (G-6-P) into 6-membered  
carbocycle DOI,$^{5,6}$ the intermediate of the first step of DOS  
biosynthesis.$^{3,7-10}$ The reaction mechanism of DOIS has  
already been elucidated, as shown in Figure 1(A), by crossover  
experiments using an isotopically double-labeled substrate with  
partially purified enzyme preparations derived from butirosin-  
producing Bacillus circulans SANK 72073 and neomycin-pro-  
ducing Streptomyces fradiae IFO 13147.$^{11,12}$

The overall reaction of DOIS comprises five steps. Initial  
NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenation at C4 of the G-6-P sub-

strate, followed by elimination of the phosphate from C6, gives an enone functionality on the glucose backbone. The hydride, which is derived from the initial dehydrogenation and resides at the associated NADH, comes back to the original C4 position of the intermediate to afford cyclic enol ether. After subsequent hemiacetal ring opening, the final aldol-type intramolecular condensation between C6 and C1 gives rise to DOI. This DOIS reaction was pointed out to be mechanically similar to that of dehydroquinase synthase [DHQS, Fig. 1(B)], which catalyzes the cyclization of 3-deoxy-D-arabino-heptulosonate-7-phosphate to dehydroquinase (DHQ) in the shikimate pathway, but dissimilarities between DOIS and DHQS were also found, particularly in the stereochemistry for the phosphate elimination reaction and the following cyclization.

Recently, we isolated DOIS from the aforementioned *Bacillus circulans* SANK72073. The gene (*btrC*) was subsequently cloned and over-expressed in *Escherichia coli*. A certain homology (25–29%) was observed between *B. circulans* DOIS and several DHQSs on the amino acid level. With the recombinant DOIS (BtrC) in hand, we envisaged the high potential of DOIS and DOI for the preparation of various useful resources, particularly benzenoid compounds. We successfully demonstrated a short-step conversion of D-glucose into catechol by a chemoenzymatic approach with DOIS. Additionally, syntheses of compounds like carbasugar or hydroquinone from DOI have been described recently.

To explore the potential of DOIS and DOI for antibiotic improvement and chemical manufacturing, more detailed features of the chemistry and substrate recognition of the DOIS active site must be clarified. Along this line, we have very recently described substrate rec-

### METHODS

#### Purification, crystallization, and data collection

The expression and purification of DOIS (BtrC) were carried out according to the method described by Nango et al. The purified enzyme was desalted using 5 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.7) containing 0.2 mM CoCl₂ and concentrated to 10 mg/mL, followed by storage at 193 K. BtrC crystals were grown by the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 277 K. A 2 μL droplet of 4.2 mg/mL protein solution mixed with the same amount of reser-

voir solution was equilibrated against 1 mL reservoir solution [40% (w/v) PEG 4000, 200 mM Li₂SO₄, and 100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.6)] to obtain BtrC crystals. Rectangular crystals with approximate dimensions of 0.1 × 0.1 × 0.3 mm³ were obtained in a month. The crystal was flash-frozen in the mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) glycerol in the cryostream. The space group of the BtrC crystal was determined to be monoclinic $P2_1$ with unit cell parameters $a = 80.51$, $b = 70.35$, $c = 82.98$ Å, and $\beta = 117.84^\circ$.

The protein-inhibitor-NAD⁺ complex of BtrC with C-6-P was obtained by adding 1 mM C-6-P and 1 mM NAD⁺ to BtrC crystals. After an incubation period of 4 h, the crystal was flash-frozen in the mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol in the cryostream.

Heavy atom derivatives were prepared by soaking crystals in the appropriate solutions (Table I). The crystals were placed in the cryoprotectant (20% (v/v) glycerol) for a few seconds. All crystals mounted in a cryoloop were flash-cooled in a liquid nitrogen stream at 100 K. Diffraction data of crystals were collected at the Photon Factory BL 6A station (Tsukuba) with an ADSC Quantum 4R CCD detector system (ADSC, CA) and at BL26B1 of SPring-8 (Harima) using the Rigaku/MSC Jupiter210 detector system. Data collection was also carried out using a Rigaku RAXIS-IV with a rotating anode generator that produced Ni-filtered Cu Kα X-rays ($\lambda = 1.5418$ Å). The data from the Photon Factory were processed using MOSFLM²⁴ and SCALA.²⁵ In the case of SPring-8 and RAXIS-IV, data were processed with CrystalClear (Rigaku/MSC) or DENZO and SCALEPACK.²⁶

### Phase determination

Native BtrC (Native-1) was expected to contain a cobalt ion, since cobalt ions are essential to its activity. Thus, EDTA-soaked Native data (Native-2) without the effect of the cobalt ion was required for the phase determination. The phase was determined using MIRAS (the multiple isomorphous replacements with anomalous scattering) method by collecting two native data sets and four data sets obtained from two kinds of derivatives. In phase determination, Native-1 was used as heavy-atom derivative data and Native-2 was treated as native data. Possible heavy atom positions approximated from the Harker sections were assessed using a cross-phased difference-Fourier map, where minor sites of each derivative were found. Phase calculations were carried out using MLPHARE.²⁷ The initial phase set was calculated at 2.6 Å resolution with an overall figure of merit of 0.43.

In comparison between in-house and synchrotron data sets, the positions of heavy atoms in the same derivatives were identical; however, the phase obtained using only synchrotron data sets showed unclear electron density. Using all data sets, the electron density map became clearer. The solvent-flattened map by DM²⁷ was helpful in the model building.

### Model building and refinement

In the case of native BtrC, electron density visualization and model building were done with O.²⁸ Using the built model and the phase from MIRAS, density improvement was carried out by SIGMAA.²⁹ After several improvements, simulated annealing torsion angle refinement was followed by group B-factor refinement and energy minimization and performed using CNS.³⁰ The refinement was performed using Native-1 data sets. Several rounds of refinement were combined with model building in O after inspection of both $2F_o - F_c$ and $F_o - F_c$ maps. Water molecules were initially picked using CNS and then manually verified in XTALVIEW.³¹ Refinement statistics can be found in Table II. There was no residue in the disallowed region of the Ramachandran

### BtrC structure overview

The structure of BtrC is a homodimer composed of two crystallographically independent subunits. BtrC is known to form a homodimer in solution. The monomer structure of BtrC consists of an N-terminal domain and a C-terminal domain [Fig. 2(A)]. A deep cleft is located between the two domains. A cobalt ion is located in the metal binding site between the two domains and is coordinated by three residues (His 246, His 262, Glu 183) at the back of the cleft. The N-terminal domain (residues 2–172) is a three-layer (α/β/α) sandwich known as an NAD-binding Rossmann fold, which contains a seven-stranded parallel β-sheet that has a β-hairpin (residues 2–18) crosslinked by a disulfide bond. This domain also has a β-hairpin existing far from the Rossmann fold. The C-terminal domain (residues 173–368) contains six α-helices, one short α-helix (residues 199–203), and four β-strands (residues 332–356). This domain is classified into an up-down bundle, as a DHQS-like α-domain. The overall structure was found to be very similar to that of DHQS derived from *Aspergillus nidulans* (AnDHQS; 1dqs.pdb, rmsd, 2.8 Å) from a search using DALI. A superimposed figure is shown in Figure 2(B). The N-terminal domain is similar in the main chain structure to that of AnDHQS but the C-terminal domain is different from that of AnDHQS. The difference in these domains probably originates from the orientation of the α-helices and the conformation of the β-hairpin. Additionally, the two moieties corresponding to the α-helices in AnDHQS form loops (residues 191–209 and 304–309) in this domain. These differences are interesting because the C-terminal domain is thought to be responsible for the recognition of the substrate.

### RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

#### Determination of DOIS (BtrC) structure

The structure of BtrC was determined at 2.3 Å resolution by MIRAS. The asymmetric unit contains two molecules as one dimer. A noncrystallographic symmetry twofold axis exists between the two molecules, which are parallel to the crystallographic 2<sub>1</sub>-axis. Thus, a clear peak was observed in the native Patterson map.

In each subunit, densities corresponding to almost all residues (1–368) were observed, but no density was observed for Met 1, 192–195, and 320–329 residues of chain A and for Met 1, 305–308, and 319–329 residues of chain B. The stereochemistry of the model is good, with 90.2% of residues in the most favored region of the Ramachandran plot generated using PROCHECK. The residue Ala 9 of chain B (0.2%) is located in the disallowed regions of the Ramachandran plot while residue Ala 9 of chain A is located in the generously allowed regions. The location of these residues in a distorted hairpin loop bounding the disulfide bond may affect Ala 9. The final model consists of 705 residues, 386 water molecules, four Co<sup>2+</sup>, two SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup>, and three glycerol

### Dimer structure

The BtrC homodimer is clearly distinguished from adjacent molecules, which indicates that this homodimer is a tightly bound. The dimer interface is mainly formed by the N-terminal domain in each subunit. The dimer buries a total surface area of 1041 Å². Hydrogen bonds are mediated by residues Glu 85, Met 116, Phe 118, Arg 119, Gln 142, Thr 147, Leu 152, and Gly 154. In particular, the residue Arg 119 intrudes into the deep cleft in a proximal subunit. In the subsequent finding of the complex structure, it turned out that Arg 119 participated in the recognition of the substrate. Therefore, this dimer interaction should play an important role for the enzyme reaction.

The BtrC-inhibitor-NAD⁺ complex structure overview

The protein-inhibitor-NAD⁺ complex of BtrC was obtained by adding C-6-P and NAD⁺ to BtrC crystals. The undetermined flexible regions in the native BtrC were observed in the complex structure. Electron densities corresponding to all residues except for Met 1 were observed, but residues 322–328 of chain B were unclear. Construction of a model of these residues (322–328) based on the model from chain A failed. The induced fit was found from the result of superimposing the native and the complex structure [Fig. 2(C)]. Lys 322 on the loop of residues 320–330 was observed near the phosphate derived from C-6-P at the active site. The AnDHQS structure shows that the substrate binding induced a large-scale domain movement with the N- and C-terminal domains.³⁸,³⁹ However in BtrC, the gate-keeping loop of residues 320–330 moves simply toward the active site in the complex structure, and the N- and C-terminal domains show no change in orientation between the native structure and the complex structure. The overall structure of the BtrC-inhibitor-NAD⁺ complex is shown in Figure 2(D). The NAD⁺ molecule is located on the side of the N-terminal domain in an inverted orientation to that observed in other classic Rossmann-fold proteins. This orientation is similar to that of AnDHQS. The pro-R site of the nicotinamide moiety is in contact with the inhibitor in an expected allocation from a previous experiment.⁴⁰ The inhibitor was found to bind the cobalt ion with the hydroxyl groups of the substrate analog. Interestingly enough, the inhibitor is spontaneously converted into a dephospho-

rylated compound and a phosphate ion in one subunit (chain A). In the other subunit (chain B), C-6-P exists without change.

**Active site in chain A**

Observation of the dephosphorylated C-6-P compound at this active site indicated that oxidation of the hydroxyl group at C4 had occurred, along with the elimination of the phosphate group, and that its product remained at this site [Figs. 3(A), 4, 6(A)]. From previous results, it is known that C-6-P is converted into a reactive $\alpha,\beta$-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate, which binds covalently to Lys 141 in BtrC. However, no covalent bond formation was observed in this structure. In this complex structure, a reduced dephosphorylated compound (Fig. 4) was used as a model because the electron density fitted to the reduced product rater than a carbonyl intermediate.

After soaking the crystal in the inhibitor solution for longer time (several days), a covalent bond formation was observed between Lys 141 and the dephosphorylated C-6-P compound (data not shown). In this case, the electron density for the gatekeeping loop and $NAD^+$ was unclear; good quality data was not obtained. Moreover, the BtrC crystals were broken under higher ligand concentrations and co-crystallization was unsuccessful. Thus, the soaking experiments for obtaining the complex were performed under low concentration (1 mM) of the inhibitor and for a relatively short time (4 h).

As to the interactions between products and residues, the phosphate ion interacts with Lys 322 in the gatekeeping loop, and with Lys 141, Asn 151, and Arg 119 in the neighboring subunit (Fig. 4). The C3 and C4 hydroxyl groups of the dephosphorylated compound bind a cobalt ion. Glu 235, Lys 225, Asp 135, and Lys 186 play an important role in the recognition of other hydroxyl groups as shown in Figure 4. Until now, there was no information regarding the recognition of hydroxyl groups at Cl of the substrate. On the basis of the structure, Glu 235 and Lys 225 were found to participate in the recognition of hydroxyl groups at this site. Thus, Glu 235 is especially expected to take part in the deprotonation of the Cl hydroxyl group during hemiacetal ring opening. Also, from the orientation of Glu 235, the enzyme is considered to recognize the $\beta$-anomer of G-6-P rather than the $\alpha$-anomer. Thus, the Cl hydroxyl group of G-6-P should

retain its orientation while being converted to the product through the course of the reaction. In fact, the stereochemistry for the corresponding hydroxyl group of the product is known to assume the β-position [Fig. 1(A)]; its epimer cannot be obtained. Thus, Glu 235 must be essential in the stereochemical control of the product.

We previously proposed that the protonated amino group of the Lys 141 side chain was converted to a nucleophilic free amino group by the phosphate ion ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) eliminated in the enzyme reaction, because Lys 141 attached itself to the α,β-unsaturated carbonyl intermediate of C-6-P to form a covalent bond. ${}^{18}$ In this complex structure, the phosphate ion is located close to Lys 141 and there is no residue around Lys 141 for proton abstraction. Therefore, the present data strongly indicate that an eliminated phosphate ion ($\text{PO}_4^{3-}$) is involved in the deprotonation of Lys 141.

### Active site in chain B

At this active site, unreacted C-6-P was observed and the electron density of $\text{NAD}^+$ was weaker than at that of chain A. The nicotinamide group in chain B showed particularly weak density although the density of the nicotinamide group in chain A was also weaker than that of the adenylate group (Fig. 3). The longer the crystal was soaked in $\text{NAD}^+$ solution, the more unclear the electron density of the nicotinamide group became. The fact that only the nicotinamide group in $\text{NAD}^+$ was unclear may indicate the structural flexibility of the group. On the basis of the weak electron density, models of $\text{NAD}^+$ were built as shown in Figure 5. The occupancies of $\text{NAD}^+$ and the inhibitor at both active sites are not low, since the $B$-factor for ligands is considered to be reasonable, as shown in Table II.

appear to approach the inhibitor more closely in the complex than in the native enzyme.

## Proposed reaction mechanism of DOIS

We have investigated the reaction mechanism of DOIS using various substrate analogs. Two possible pathways for DOIS have been proposed. Namely, when the phosphate elimination reaction takes place in an anti-fashion, the following cyclization reaction proceeds through a chair conformation (Fig. 7). Another pathway is the syn-phosphate elimination, followed by the reaction through a boat conformation. The BtrC structure complexed with ligands clearly shows that the phosphate orientation of C-6-P is syn-conformation. Thus, the syn-phosphate elimination and the following cyclization through a boat conformation seem most likely for the overall DOIS reaction.

The proposed reaction mechanism is summarized in Figure 8. In the first step, the substrate is oxidized at C4 by NAD⁺. His 250 can accept the proton lost from the C4 hydroxyl group through a hydrogen bond. The hydride transfers from C4 of the substrate to the NAD⁺ nicotinamide ring closely located in the pro-R site orientation, which is consistent with the experimental result. The cobalt ion binds with the C4 hydroxyl group and stimulates the hydride transfer and the proton loss by polarizing the C4 hydroxyl group. After oxidation, proton abstraction at C5 by the carboxylate of Glu 243 triggers the phosphate elimination reaction. The syn-elimination reaction is generally unfavorable as compared to the anti-elimination, but the syn-elimination easily occurs given a

Comparison of active site between the native and complex BtrC

There are differences between the active sites of the native BtrC and the BtrC-inhibitor-NAD⁺ complex. The crucial difference is the gatekeeping participation in the active site. As mentioned above, Lys 322 in the gatekeeping loop and conformers of His 250 are observed in only the complex’s active site. Other residues of the active site in the complex also change in comparison to the native active sites.

Side-chains of Glu 72 and Glu 176 are changed because of the interaction with NAD⁺ by these residues through hydrogen bonds. Residues that recognize the inhibitor, namely Lys 141, Asn 151, Glu 235, and Glu 243,

spatial restraint. Subsequently, the eliminated phosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) accepts the proton from the ammonium form of Lys 141. In the third step, the ketone group of the dephosphorylated intermediate is reduced by NADH. Thus, the hydride returns to the original C4 of the substrate. The ring opening before aldol condensation seems to be assisted by the proton abstraction by the carboxylate of Glu 235, which is located 2.8 Å from the O1 oxygen of the inhibitor. The following aldol condensation proceeds through a boat conformation. This conformation may have an advantage because the boat conformation in this case is produced by a minimal rotation of an enolate compared to the chair conformation. The generated alkoxide anion at O1 may receive the proton from Glu 235 to form the hydroxyl group of DOI. After the release of DOI, the free amino group on Lys 141 may receive the proton from the protonated Glu 243, and DOIS returns to its initial state.

**Comparison of the active sites of DOIS and DHQS**

The BtrC structures reveal that the active site of DOIS is very similar to that of DHQS as shown in Figure 6(A–C). The conserved amino acid residues are localized at both active sites. Although no residue corresponding to Lys 356 in DHQS exists in the DOIS active site in chain B [Fig. 6(B)], Lys 322 is observed in chain A [Fig. 6(A)] corresponding to Lys 356.

However, the presence of two residues, Glu 243 and Glu 235, at the active site of DOIS marks a significant difference from DHQS [Fig. 6(D)]. These residues are conserved among various DOISs. Glu 243 and Glu 235 correspond to asparagine and arginine residues in DHQS, respectively. These are also conserved among various DHQSs. Although the distinction between the two active sites consists only of two residues, the resulting reaction mechanisms differ greatly. In the DHQS reaction, phosphate elimination takes place in a syn-fashion by intramolecular self-catalysis, and the ultimate aldol reaction proceeds through a chair conformation. The reason for the difference of the reaction mechanism is considered as follows. Since the asparagine residue corresponding to Glu 243 in DOIS does not act as a base for deprotonation, the intramolecular phosphate group plays the role of a base in DHQS to form HPO₄²⁻. Therefore, the side-chain of the lysine residue corresponding to Lys 141 remains in ammonium form during the DHQS reaction. The ammonium form of lysine in DHQS is expected to stabilize the enolate after the ring opening. This ionic interaction may cause a chair conformation during the aldol reaction in the DHQS reaction, while a boat conformation is generated by the minimum rotation of the enolate. The strong basic phosphate ion (PO₄³⁻) that is generated in the DOIS reaction converts Lys 141 into a free amino group. In the DOIS reaction, there is no ionic interaction between the ammonium form in the

lysine residue and the enolate anion; thus, the aldol condensation proceeds through a boat conformation by the minimum rotation of the enolate. Consequently, Glu 243 in DOIS, which abstracts the proton at C5, is significant in determining the stereochemistry of the overall reaction.

A different residue, Glu 235 in DOIS, is considered to play a role for recognition and deprotonation of the hydroxyl group at Cl. In DHQS, the arginine residue is located at the same position as Glu 235 and recognizes a β-oriented carboxylate group on the anomeric position of the substrate. The major substrate difference between DOIS and DHQS is the anomeric position. It is surprising that the substrates differ by only one residue. Additionally, Glu 235 is a conserved amino acid between both enzymes. The arginine residue in DHQS is replaced by glycine among various DOISs. While the side-chain of Glu 235 is directed toward the substrate in the DOIS structure, the corresponding glutamic acid residue in DHQS does not take a part in the active site because the arginine recognizing the anomeric position interrupts the participation in the active site. It is notable that a conserved residue plays a different role in the two enzymes.

**CONCLUSIONS**

The difference in structures of native BtrC and the BtrC-inhibitor-NAD⁺ complex reported here provides details about the active-site residues and insights into the reaction mechanism. In particular, the present study suggests that the phosphate elimination mechanism is syn-elimination assisted by Glu 243 and the aldol condensation proceeds through a boat conformation. Also discussed are significant similarities and dissimilarities between DOIS and DHQS, particularly in terms of the structures at the active site and the reaction mechanisms. Since DOIS is a typical enzyme in the secondary metabolism and is evolutionarily related to DHQS in the primary metabolism, the evolutionary relationship of these enzymes is intriguing from the viewpoint of comparative and structural biology.
