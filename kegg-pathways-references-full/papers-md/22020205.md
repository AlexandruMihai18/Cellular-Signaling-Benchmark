# Targeting protein prenylation for cancer therapy

**Norbert Berndt**, **Andrew D. Hamilton** and **Said M. Sebti**

**Abstract** | Protein farnesylation and geranylgeranylation, together referred to as prenylation, are lipid post-translational modifications that are required for the transforming activity of many oncogenic proteins, including some RAS family members. This observation prompted the development of inhibitors of farnesyltransferase (FT) and geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGT1) as potential anticancer drugs. In this Review, we discuss the mechanisms by which FT and GGT1 inhibitors (FTIs and GGTIs, respectively) affect signal transduction pathways, cell cycle progression, proliferation and cell survival. In contrast to their preclinical efficacy, only a small subset of patients responds to FTIs. Identifying tumours that depend on farnesylation for survival remains a challenge, and strategies to overcome this are discussed. One GGTI has recently entered the clinic, and the safety and efficacy of GGTIs await results from clinical trials.

### Farnesylation
One of two types of prenylation. This involves the transfer of a farnesyl moiety to the cysteine of the C-terminal CaaX box of the target protein. Catalysed by farnesyltransferase.

Interest in developing inhibitors of farnesylation as anticancer drugs was prompted by the realization more than 20 years ago that a sizable proportion of some, but not all, human cancers harbour activating oncogenic mutations in the RAS genes (between 8% and 93%, depending on the tumour type), and that RAS GTPases require this lipid post-translational modification (PTM) for their malignant transforming activity. Furthermore, many of the signal transduction pathways that are activated by RAS involve proteins that require farnesylation or geranylgeranylation (together referred to as prenylation) for their ability to mediate tumour cell survival, growth, proliferation, migration and metastasis (FIG. 1). This, coupled with the fact that it has notoriously been difficult to design small GTPase inhibitors per se, prompted a global quest to develop farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors (FTIs) and geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGT1) inhibitors (GGTIs) (together referred to as prenyltransferase (PT) inhibitors (PTIs)) as potential anticancer drugs.

Preclinical studies in the 1990s demonstrated that FTIs are highly successful in killing cancer cells *in vitro* and in animals with very little toxicity, thus generating much excitement and raising the hope that, finally, a RAS inhibitor may be developed as a novel anticancer drug. Contrary to expectations, however, responses to FTIs, whether in cells, animals or human patients, do not seem to depend on RAS mutations; and the inhibition of KRAS farnesylation leads to its geranylgeranylation (discussed below). Furthermore, in most clinical trials FTIs have not been as successful as expected, with no survival advantages, for example, to patients with advanced solid cancers or with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). However, monotherapy with FTIs demonstrates antitumour activity in a subset of cancer patients, particularly those with haematological malignancies, whereas combinations of FTIs with cytotoxic agents improve the responses of patients with locally advanced breast cancer or other advanced solid tumours. At present, we do not understand why some tumours are resistant while others are sensitive to FTIs. Clearly, the identification of the farnesylated proteins the inhibition of which is responsible for the antitumour effects of FTIs will lead to a better understanding of their mechanism of action and to the selection of patients whose tumours are sensitive to FTI treatment.

GGTIs as potential anticancer agents were developed for several reasons. First, KRAS (predominantly the alternatively spliced KRAS4B variant), which is the most frequently mutated isoform of RAS, and NRAS become geranylgeranylated and remain fully functional when cells are treated with FTIs. Second, in some human malignancies, such as pancreatic cancer with KRAS mutated in 90% of patients, pathways that are mediated by geranylgeranylated proteins downstream of RAS, such as RALA and RALB, may be more relevant to oncogenesis than those mediated by MEK or AKT. Third, the exclusively geranylgeranylated RHOC has an essential role in metastasis. Fourth, the small GTPases cell division cycle 42 (CDC42) and RAC,

At a glance
- Post-translational modifications with the lipids farnesyl or geranylgeranyl (together referred to as prenyl) are catalysed by farnesyltransferase (FT) or geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGT1) and are required for the cellular localization, function and cancer-causing activities of some proteins. Among the hundreds of proteins that are estimated to be prenylated most are either exclusively farnesylated (for example, HRAS and RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB)) or geranylgeranylated (for example, RHOA, RHOC, RALA and RALB); some are both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated (RHOB), and others are naturally farnesylated but become geranylgeranylated when FT is inhibited (for example, KRAS and NRAS).
- These and other important observations prompted the design and development of inhibitors of FT (FTIs) and GGT1 (GGTIs) as potential anticancer drugs. Several FTIs have been tested clinically but only one GGTI has recently entered clinical trials.
- Further validation of FT and GGT1 as anticancer drug targets was recently provided by genetic mouse models: conditional loss of FT and/or GGT1 hampers mutant KRAS-induced tumorigenesis and extends the lifespan of mice.
- FTI treatment results in the reversal of several hallmarks of cancer, including mitotic arrest at prometaphase, induction of apoptosis, inhibition of anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth, invasion, angiogenesis and tumour growth, as well as induction of tumour regression in animal models. These effects seem to be mediated by interference with aberrant signal transduction pathways such as RAF–MEK–ERK, PI3K–AKT, and other oncogenic and survival pathways.
- GGTI treatment also results in the reversal of the cancer hallmarks mentioned above except that they block cells in the G1 phase of the cell cycle, and this seems to be owing to their ability to induce the accumulation of the cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors p21 and p27 and to inhibit CDKs and induce hypophosphorylation of RB. GGTI treatment also decreases the levels of phospho-AKT and survivin, and this seems to mediate their ability to induce apoptosis.
- Although in preclinical models FTIs are highly effective as antitumour agents, in clinical trials limited efficacy was observed. This is primarily due to poor patient selection. This in turn is due to our lack of understanding of the mechanism of action of FTIs. In the future, a major effort must be dedicated to identifying the prenylated proteins the inhibition of which is responsible for the antitumour effects of PTIs. This will be of great value not only for enhancing our understanding of the mechanism of action of FTIs and GGTIs, but also for selecting patients whose tumours are addicted to specific prenylated proteins and who are more likely to respond to these agents. Recent advances in techniques to characterize the human prenylome are likely to accelerate achieving these crucial goals in the prenylation field.

General aspects of protein prenylation
The importance of FT and GGT1 for normal physiology and tumorigenesis: lessons from knockout mice. The biochemistry of prenylation and pioneering findings in the field of prenylation research are summarized in BOX 1 and the TIMELINE, respectively. Protein prenylation is required for the membrane localization of otherwise cytosolic proteins. Studies in yeast²⁷ and mammalian cells²⁸ suggest that protein prenylation is also required for the normal function of at least some proteins. Additionally, defective prenylation has been attributed to the pathogenesis of several diseases other than cancer (BOX 2). Contemporary reviews have estimated that several hundred proteins are subject to prenylation²⁹,³⁰. Therefore, the inhibition of FT activity probably prevents many proteins from functioning properly, and it is perhaps not surprising that genetic disruption of the catalytic FT β-subunit (Fntb) in mice causes embryos to die very early in development³¹ (TABLE 1). Whether the constitutive ablation of GGT1 activity in mammals is also embryonically lethal has not yet been determined. However, studies conducted in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*³², *Drosophila melanogaster*³³ and mouse embryonic fibroblasts³⁴, as well as the fact that more proteins are geranylgeranylated than are farnesylated³⁵, suggest that GGT1 function is essential for survival and development, and that the functions of FT and GGT1 are not redundant.

More interesting in this context are the results obtained with conditional PT deletions. The first such study by Barbacid and colleagues³¹ suggested that FT is not required for tumour initiation in mice, either in mice developing KRAS-G12V-induced lung adenocarcinoma or in mice subjected to carcinogen-induced skin carcinoma, but that it is required for tumour progression and maintenance³¹. The study also suggested that adult mice lacking Fntb show normal tissue homeostasis except for slight defects in wound healing or liver regeneration. Finally, in these conditional FT-knockout mice, the authors suggested that wild-type HRAS still associates with cellular membranes³¹. Recently, these unexpected results have been called into question by Yang et al.³⁶ who re-analysed the conditional Fntb-null allele generated by the Barbacid laboratory: it produced a transcript that encoded a protein with a short in-frame deletion rather than, as expected, a transcript with a frameshift mutation that resulted in a true null allele. Thus, the results described above may have been due to a ‘leaky’ null allele that permitted the expression of partially active FT.

Two other recent studies by Bergo and colleagues have shown that conditional Fntb deficiency³⁷ or conditional Pggtlb (which encodes the catalytic β-subunit of GGT1) deficiency³⁴ reduces the formation of KRAS-G12D-induced lung cancer in mice. Furthermore, simultaneous knockout of both Fntb and Pggtlb has a far greater effect on KRAS-G12D-induced lung tumour onset and progression than either deletion alone³⁷. Also, loss of both Fntb and Pggtlb significantly extends the lifespan of mice that express activated KRAS-G12D in their lungs, which validates FT and GGT1 as important targets for cancer therapy. In contrast to the earlier study by Barbacid et al.³¹, Bergo and colleagues demonstrated

Geranylgeranylation
This prenylation is catalysed by geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGT1) or GGT2. GGT1 transfers a geranylgeranyl moiety to the cysteine of the C-terminal CaaX box, and GGT2 acts on the cysteines of C-terminal CXC or CC motifs.

Prenylation
Also known as isoprenylation. An irreversible post-translational modification of proteins consisting of the covalent attachment of an isoprenyl lipid to a cysteine within four residues of the C terminus.

Figure 1 | RAS signalling pathways in mammalian cells. Active (farnesylated, membrane-bound and GTP-bound) RAS modulates a number of signalling pathways. Oncogenic RAS mutations tend to lock RAS in its GTP-bound state, resulting in constitutive RAS signalling. The major RAS effector pathways that are activated by RAS are the RAF–MEK–MAPK signalling cascade and the PI3K–AKT pathway. The RAF–MEK–MAPK pathway ultimately activates the ETS family of transcription factors, which induce multiple genes that promote cell cycle progression and cell migration. Likewise, AKT phosphorylates multiple cellular proteins, leading to the inhibition of several tumour suppressors (such as p27, p53, tuberous sclerosis 1 (TSC1), TSC2 and BCL-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD)) or leading to the activation of several oncogene products. RAS also activates other small GTPases such as RALA and RALB, which have recently been shown to mediate RAS transformation in human pancreatic tumours, for example. Farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) were originally developed to block the function of RAS. However, as numerous studies *in vitro* and *in vivo* have shown, their antitumour activity is not correlated with the mutation status of KRAS isoforms. This suggests that the antitumour activity of FTIs relies on blocking the activity of other prenylated proteins. However, the inhibition of RAS protein function may still be important, particularly for tumours with mutant HRAS and tumours addicted to wild-type RAS.

that *Fntb* transcripts were not detectable, and HRAS does not associate with cell membranes in the absence of FT³⁷, confirming earlier cell-based studies.

Bergo and colleagues have also recently described the effect of GGT1 deficiency in the haematopoietic system³⁸. Mice harbouring an inducible *Kras*<sup>G12D</sup> oncogene in haematopoietic cells develop a lethal myeloproliferative disease (MPD), and up to one-third also develop acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Whereas the absence of GGT1 markedly reduced the severity of MPD, it had no effect on ALL³⁸. As KRAS can be farnesylated in the absence of GGT1, the antitumour effects of GGT1 depletion with regards to MPD can be attributed to defective prenylation of other GGT1 targets³⁸ that are downstream of KRAS, such as RALA and RALB.

Regulation of PTs. Given the importance of PTs, it is surprising that their regulation in response to external signals has not been investigated in great detail. The α-subunit of FT and GGT1, FNTα, has been shown to be phosphorylated in a transforming growth factor-β (TGFβ)-dependent manner, which either does not affect³⁹ or decreases FT activity⁴⁰. FNTβ was also shown to be phosphorylated⁴¹, raising the possibility that both of these events are necessary to modulate FT activity. Furthermore, insulin stimulates activating phosphorylation of FNTα by a member of the RAF1–MEK–MAPK pathway⁴².

FNTα is cleaved by caspase 3 during apoptosis⁴³, suggesting that some signals may induce apoptosis by indirectly inhibiting the prenylation and the function of proteins that are involved in cell survival. Interestingly, dietary fish oil, which contains high levels of Ω3 polyunsaturated fatty acids, inhibits the expression of FT and colon tumorigenesis in rats⁴⁴, which is consistent with the observation that FT activity is increased in human colon cancer⁴⁵. These findings also raise the possibility that FTIs may

function as chemopreventive agents, an idea that has received experimental support in mouse models of lung cancer 46,47.

**Mechanism of action of FTIs**

The observation that FT and GGT1 may be dispensable for adult tissue homeostasis, but may be required for KRAS-driven tumorigenesis 34,37, further validated the concept of developing PTIs as novel anticancer drugs. Several strategies, including structure-based drug design

and high-throughput screens, were used to identify a variety of PTIs (see Supplementary information S1 (table) for structures and potencies of representative compounds).

Depending on the context, the treatment of cancer cells with FTIs results in the induction of apoptosis, cell cycle arrest and the inhibition of anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell proliferation, cell migration and angiogenesis (see Supplementary information S2 (table)). The exact mechanisms by which FTIs induce the antitumour effects described above

**Box 1 | Biochemistry of protein prenylation**

Prenylation is a universal lipid post-translational modification (PTM) of cysteine residues near the carboxyl terminus that facilitates membrane association 174,175. Using farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) as the lipid donor, this enzymatically catalysed PTM transfers either a C<sub>15</sub> farnesyl (F) or a C<sub>20</sub> geranylgeranyl (GG) group to the sulphhydryl group of the cysteine residue, thus forming covalent thioether bonds. In eukaryotic cells, prenylation is catalysed by three 'housekeeping' enzymes, farnesyltransferase (FT), geranylgeranyltransferase 1 (GGT1) and GGT2. We focus on FT and GGT1. FT and GGT1 are cytosolic heterodimeric proteins that share a common α-subunit 176, but that have homologous but distinct β-subunits 177. The crystal structure of FT shows a crescent-shaped helical hairpin domain and an α-α barrel domain 178. Both FT and GGT1 are metalloenzymes that require zinc for catalysing the covalent binding of the prenyl group carbon to the CaaX cysteine thiol 179.

Enzyme kinetics and other biochemical studies indicated that FPP first binds to FT, which is followed by the binding of the protein substrate, with prenylation of the substrate occurring much faster than the release of the farnesylated protein product. Proteins modified by FT or GGT1 seem to share a conserved C-terminal CaaX recognition motif (in which C is cysteine, a is an aliphatic amino acid and X is variable). The nature of the C-terminal residue X specifies whether a protein is a substrate for FT or for GGT1: whereas FT prefers X to be methionine, serine, glutamine or cysteine, GGT1 prefers X to be leucine or isoleucine 180. However, these rules are not absolute: for example, a CaaX protein with a C-terminal phenylalanine can be farnesylated or geranylgeranylated 181. And although GGT1 clearly prefers X to be leucine 182, some Caal motifs can also be farnesylated by FT 183. Furthermore, at least one protein, RHOB (CaaX box sequence: CKVL), is naturally both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated 35. Proteins with a C-terminal CaaX box can undergo up to three additional PTMs (see part a of the figure). Some proteins such as KRAS4B (CaaX box sequence: CVIM) and NRAS (CaaX box sequence: CVVM) are naturally only farnesylated, but can be geranylgeranylated and remain fully functional in the presence of an FTI (see part b of the figure). To block KRAS function would thus require the inhibition of both FT and GGT1 (REFS 12–15). It is not known how many other farnesylated proteins can be cross-prenylated by GGT1, but the presence of a C-terminal methionine seems to be important for the ability of proteins to undergo cross-prenylation.

are unknown mainly because the identity of the crucial farnesylated proteins, the inhibition of which mediates these FTI effects, is unknown (discussed further below). However, several studies have shown that FTIs affect oncogenic and survival signal transduction pathways, which can explain some of their antitumour effects.

**Cell proliferation.** FTIs inhibit signalling pathways that are involved in anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent proliferation. In well-defined systems in which mutant HRAS drives the transformation of NIH3T3 cells, FTIs inhibit the farnesylation of HRAS, prevent its association with the plasma membrane, inhibit downstream signal transduction pathways such as RAF–MEK–MAPK<sup>48</sup> and inhibit tumour growth<sup>15</sup>. In human tumour cell lines with multiple genetic alterations, FTIs inhibit PI3K–AKT signalling, particularly in ovarian and pancreatic cancer cells that overexpress AKT2 (REF. 49), although this seems to be context-specific, as, in lung cancer cells with low or undetectable levels of phospho-AKT, lonafarnib (also known as SCH66336)-induced apoptosis does not rely on AKT inhibition<sup>50</sup>. In nude mice, many FTIs inhibit the growth of human tumours harbouring a variety of genetic alterations, including KRAS mutations, TP53 deletions and silenced cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A<sup>INK4A</sup>)<sup>51</sup>. Similarly, in transgenic mice that express mutant KRAS or that overexpress wild-type NRAS, FTIs only inhibit tumour growth and do not induce tumour regression<sup>52,53</sup>. However, in mutant Hras-transgenic mice, FTIs cause tumour regression (see below) (see Supplementary information S3 (table)).

**Cell cycle progression.** FTIs primarily accumulate cells at prometaphase by preventing bipolar spindle formation and chromosome alignment<sup>54,55</sup>, which may rely on the inhibition of the farnesylation of centromere-associated protein E (CENPE) and CENPF<sup>56,57</sup>, as well as phosphatase of regenerating liver (PRL) protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs)<sup>58</sup>. However, in some human cancer cell lines FTIs can induce G1 phase arrest. For example, L-744,832 induces p21 accumulation and inhibition of RB phosphorylation<sup>59</sup>. Similarly, in Rat1 fibroblasts transformed with HRAS<sup>G12V</sup>, the FTI HR-12 causes the accumulation of p27, which results in the inhibition of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and subsequent G1 arrest<sup>60</sup>. This compound inhibits both anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent cell growth and blocks cell motility in wound healing assays. Rat1 cells transformed with myristoylated HRAS<sup>G12V</sup> are resistant to HR-12 (REF. 60), indicating that the inhibition of HRAS farnesylation is responsible for HR-12 effects.

BCL-2 antagonist of cell death (BAD), which leads to its activation. In this setting, overexpression of constitutively active AKT2 rescues FTI-induced apoptosis<sup>49</sup>. However, in other cells, FTIs induce apoptosis only when deprived of growth factors or of substratum attachment, suggesting that growth factors and integrins can rescue FTI-induced apoptosis<sup>63–65</sup>. FTIs can also induce apoptosis by enhancing death receptor signals<sup>66</sup> or by inhibiting nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB)-dependent induction of cyclin D1, survivin, inhibitor of apoptosis proteins (IAPs) and BCL-2 (REF. 67). Another FTI that has been explored in preclinical and clinical studies, BMS-214662, has pro-apoptotic activity and induces tumour regression in nude mouse xenografts, but this seems to be related to the inhibition of GGT2 and not FT or GGT1 (REF. 68).

**Angiogenesis.** Lonafarnib inhibits angiogenesis in lung and head and neck tumour cells by decreasing hypoxia and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1)-stimulated hypoxia inducible factor 1α (HIF1α) expression<sup>69</sup>. This study also showed that lonafarnib inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) production by inhibiting HIF1α binding to heat shock protein 90 (HSP90), which results in the degradation of HIF1α. Consistent with this, other FTIs, such as L-744,832 (REF. 70) and tipifarnib<sup>71</sup>, affect angiogenesis, possibly by inhibiting HIF1α expression and hypoxia. Finally, another FTI, LB42708, inhibits angiogenesis, possibly by inhibiting pathways that are mediated by MAPK and AKT<sup>72</sup>.

**Combinations.** In cell culture, structurally unrelated FTIs can enhance the growth inhibitory and apoptotic effects of radiation<sup>73</sup>, taxanes<sup>74,75</sup>, cisplatin<sup>76,77</sup>, 5-fluorouracil<sup>78</sup>, MEK inhibitors<sup>79</sup>, CDK inhibitors<sup>80</sup> and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR)–ABL inhibitor imatinib (also known as STI-571)<sup>81</sup>. In nude mouse xenografts, beneficial combinations have been reported for lonafarnib and cytotoxic agents such as cyclophosphamide, 5-fluorouracil, vincristine<sup>82</sup> and paclitaxel<sup>83</sup>, or for FTI-2148 and paclitaxel, cisplatin and gemcitabine<sup>84</sup>. We have recently found that a combination of tipifarnib and the inhibitor of AKT activation triciribine phosphate (TCNP)<sup>85</sup> (but not the single agents alone) causes breast tumour regression in Erbb2-transgenic mice<sup>86</sup>.

Several studies by Giannakakou and colleagues have recently provided a mechanistic explanation for the commonly observed synergy between FTIs and taxanes. First, they showed that lonafarnib in combination with paclitaxel enhances tubulin acetylation more than the effect of either drug alone, and that this is due to the inhibition of histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6)<sup>87</sup>, an enzyme that functions as a tubulin deacetylase and that is involved in stress response, microtubule stability and cell migration. FTIs increase the amount of microtubule-bound paclitaxel, even in cells that are resistant to paclitaxel alone, and this is dependent on functional HDAC6 (REF. 88). Finally, FT and HDAC6 physically associate with each other at microtubules, and FTIs induce the dissociation of FT from microtubules, resulting in the inhibition of HDAC6 activity, an effect that was duplicated by stable knockdown of FNTα using short hairpin RNA (shRNA)<sup>89</sup>. Most interestingly, HDAC6

**Apoptosis.** FTIs cause breast tumour regression very effectively in mutant Hras-transgenic mice<sup>61</sup> that express Myc or that lack Trp53, but not in Erbb2-transgenic mice<sup>62</sup>, suggesting that these drugs may induce apoptosis, which was confirmed by studies in cultured cells. For example, FTIs inhibit integrin-mediated and growth factor-mediated activation of the PI3K–AKT pathway, which results in the dephosphorylation of AKT substrates, including the pro-apoptotic BCL-2 family member

does not contain a carboxy-terminal CaaX motif and is thus a very unlikely FT substrate. It is possible that other FT targets that are present in the microtubule–protein complex mediate FT regulation of HDAC6.

**GGTI effects in cultured cells and in vivo**

Similar to FTIs, GGTLs induce apoptosis and inhibit tumour cell growth, both in cultured cells and in animal models (see Supplementary information S3 (table)). In contrast to FTIs, GGTLs result in G1 arrest and not mitotic arrest<sup>90</sup>. Their ability to induce G1 arrest may be due to inducing the expression of the CDK inhibitors p21 and p27, inhibition of CDK2 and CDK4, and hypophosphorylation of RB<sup>91</sup>.

**Box 2 | The use of PTIs in other diseases**

An unexpected benefit of farnesyltransferase (FT) inhibitors (FTIs) may be their potential to treat diseases other than cancer. Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a genetic disease that is associated with premature ageing and death, normally from heart failure, at about 13 years of age. HGPS is linked to a mutation in LMNA that prevents prelamin A (a substrate for FT) from proper maturation into lamin A. Normal processing of prelamin A involves, among other steps, the removal of a carboxy-terminal peptide containing farnesylcysteine. Children with HGPS are unable to perform this step, which results in a mutant form of lamin A, termed progerin<sup>184</sup>, which is persistently farnesylated and non-functional<sup>185</sup>. In fibroblasts derived from patients with HGPS and mice, as well as HeLa cells, FTIs can prevent the aberrant nuclear morphology of cells that express progerin<sup>186-188</sup>. In mouse models of HGPS, FTIs greatly improve the phenotype of HGPS with respect to lifespan, body weight and bone integrity<sup>189</sup>. Furthermore, the crucial target for FTI treatment was confirmed to be progerin<sup>190</sup>. These results suggest that FTIs may be beneficial for children with HGPS, and lonafarnib is currently being tested in clinical trials.

A common problem in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases is the hyperproliferation of smooth muscle cells, as seen in restenosis (intimal hyperplasia) of coronary arteries following balloon angioplasty or bypass surgery. Local administration of FTIs or geranylgeranyltransferase inhibitors (GGTIs) can prevent restenosis by blocking neointima formation<sup>191</sup>. GGTIs may also assist in the therapy of cardiovascular diseases by increasing nitric oxide synthase expression<sup>172</sup>.

Parasitic diseases such as malaria, Chagas disease, African sleeping sickness, Toxoplasmosis and Leishmaniasis cause millions of deaths in tropical and subtropical regions, and the therapeutic potential of FTIs for these diseases has also been explored<sup>193</sup>. FTIs specifically designed to inhibit parasitic FT and not mammalian FT are significantly more toxic to parasitic protozoa<sup>194,195</sup>. Recently, a GGT1 from *Trypanosoma cruzi*, the parasite responsible for Chagas disease, was cloned<sup>196</sup>, and GGTIs may also be effective against these diseases.

FTIs also show strong antiviral activity in mice infected with the hepatitis δ virus<sup>197</sup>. Other diseases that may also be amenable to therapy with prenyltransferase (PT) inhibitors (PTIs) are multiple sclerosis<sup>198</sup> and metabolic bone disorders<sup>199</sup>, as well as a wide variety of undesirable fibrotic reactions<sup>200</sup>.

proteins, including RHO GTPases. In MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells, GGTI-DU40, but not the FTI L-744,832, inhibits thrombin-induced cell rounding. GGTIs with novel scaffolds were recently identified by a virtual screen of 9.5 million compounds in conjunction with quantitative structure–activity relationship modelling¹⁰⁰.

### FTIs in the clinic

Starting in 2000 (REF. 101), four FTIs have been evaluated in at least 75 clinical trials: tipifarnib, lonafarnib, BMS-214662 and L-778123. In 64 of these studies (with 35 being Phase I trials), the clinical response has been determined (TABLES 2,3; see Supplementary information S4 and S5 (tables)). Sixteen years after curing transgenic mice that developed mouse mammary tumour virus (MMTV)-Hras-driven breast tumours with FTIs⁶¹, and after accumulating other very impressive preclinical data, it has become clear that in human clinical trials, monotherapy with FTIs shows limited antitumour activity in haematopoietic cancers, and generally no or very little activity in solid tumours. Thirty-eight of the 64 clinical trials (59%) concerned tipifarnib, either alone or in combination with other agents. Eighteen of the 64 trials (28%) — all but one of which was conducted in patients with solid tumours — reported no objective responses. Seventeen of the 18 trials (94%) with no objective responses were conducted with FTI monotherapy. Twenty-three of the 64 trials (36%) conducted in both solid and haematological malignancies showed very little antitumour activity (the rate of objective responses was <15%). The median objective response was 2.3% for monotherapy with FTIs and 11.4% for combinations with FTIs. Furthermore, in 28 of the 64 trials (44%), FT activity or the prenylation status of marker proteins (most commonly HDJ2 (also known as DNAJA1) or prelamin A) was assessed to determine whether the FTI treatment had affected its intended targets. There was no

in human non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells⁹⁶. In addition, GGTIs inhibit platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-stimulation of PDGF receptor (PDGFR)-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation and MAPK signalling, suggesting that PDGFR phosphorylation is mediated by a GGT1 substrate⁹⁷.

The ability of our lead GGTI, GGTI-2418 (currently in Phase I clinical trials), to inhibit anchorage-dependent and anchorage-independent growth may also depend on its ability to inhibit the geranylgeranylation of RALB or RALA, respectively⁹⁸. In addition, GGTI-2418 effectively prevents xenograft tumour growth in nude mice and results in breast tumour regression in Erbb2-transgenic mice⁹². Casey and colleagues described GGTI-DU40 (REF. 99), which is a highly potent and selective GGT1 inhibitor that inhibits the prenylation of several cellular

correlation between FT inhibition and clinical responses. Most importantly, two FTIs that have so far advanced to Phase III clinical trials are lonafarnib<sup>6</sup> and tipifarnib<sup>4,5,7</sup>, and, unfortunately, these drugs were unable to improve the outcome for advanced pancreatic cancer<sup>4</sup>, advanced colon cancer<sup>5</sup>, advanced NSCLC<sup>6</sup> or AML<sup>7</sup>, whether alone<sup>7,5</sup> or in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel<sup>6</sup> or with gemcitabine<sup>4</sup>.

What accounts for this discrepancy between laboratory findings and clinical data? First, in humans, KRAS, and not HRAS, is most frequently mutated<sup>1</sup>. Second, unlike HRAS, which is exclusively farnesylated, KRAS (and possibly NRAS) can escape FTI-mediated inhibition as it can be alternatively prenylated by GGT1 and thus is fully functional<sup>12–15</sup> (BOX 1). Third, the lack of antitumour activity may be due to the fact that most of the clinical trials enrolled patients with advanced and/or metastatic disease. It is also important to note that even though it was known

preclinically that KRAS function is resistant to FTIs, Phase III clinical trials were carried out in patients whose tumours harboured mutant KRAS (that is, patients with pancreatic cancer). Perhaps this is because preclinical studies had shown that some cancer cells that harbour mutant KRAS are sensitive to FTIs, possibly owing to the inhibition of exclusively farnesylated proteins downstream of KRAS. In another clinical trial, attempts were made to directly inhibit KRAS function by using L-778123, which inhibits both FT (half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC<sub>50</sub>) = 2nM) and GGT1 (IC<sub>50</sub> = 98nM). Unfortunately, in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients treated with this drug, KRAS prenylation was not inhibited<sup>102</sup>.

When used in combination with other agents, FTIs have fared better. For example, Phase I studies based on a combination of tipifarnib with gemcitabine and cisplatin have shown some promise in advanced solid tumours (33.3% complete response rate or 26% partial

response rate)⁸,⁹. Similarly, in Phase II neoadjuvant settings, tipifarnib increases the rate of pathological complete responses from the historical 10% to 25% when combined with chemotherapy (doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide) in patients with locally advanced breast cancer¹⁰,¹¹. The fact that some patients respond to FTIs suggests that some human tumours depend on farnesylated proteins for survival. The identification of these proteins remains a challenge that must be overcome in order to select patients whose tumours are most likely to respond to FTIs. To this end, a strategy to predict clinical response to FTIs was recently developed by Raponi *et al*. Following the analysis of gene expression profiles from patients with untreated AML, these authors found that a high ratio of expression of two genes, RAS guanyl releasing protein 1 (*RASGRP1*), which encodes a RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) that activates RAS, and aprataxin (*APTX*), which encodes a protein involved in DNA excision repair, predicts a tipifarnib-positive response of patients with AML²⁵,²⁶. Moreover, in patients with advanced solid cancers, low mRNA levels of *FNTB*, but not *FNTA*, are associated with improved response to lonafarnib plus taxane and significantly better survival¹⁰³. Similar studies are needed for other types of cancer.

**Targets crucial for the antitumour activity of FTIs**

As the data described above have illustrated, and as can be expected of drugs that affect a large number of PT substrates, PTIs trigger a plethora of molecular and cellular effects, whether in cell culture, animal models or in human cancer patients. A key question is, what are the crucial PT substrates that mediate these effects? The answer to this question may uncover why FTIs and GGTIs are only effective in a subset of cells and tumours.

**RAS proteins as crucial targets for FTIs.** FTIs were originally developed to inhibit RAS function. However, the ability of FTIs to inhibit tumour growth is not correlated with mutations in RAS, whether in cells¹⁰⁴,¹⁰⁵, animals¹⁰⁵ or human patients¹⁰⁶ (discussed above). KRAS, the

most frequently mutated human oncoprotein, becomes geranylgeranylated and is fully functional in tumour cells treated with FTIs¹²⁻¹⁵. However, FTIs are effective at inhibiting the growth of mutant KRAS-harbouring tumours in nude mice¹⁰⁷ and transgenic mouse models⁵³, suggesting that the inhibition of KRAS farnesylation is not required for FTI antitumour activity, and that, in these models, tumours are addicted to farnesylated proteins other than KRAS. Similar considerations apply to NRAS, because it can also escape FTI-mediated inhibition. HRAS, conversely, is not alternatively geranylgeranylated in cells treated with FTIs. Therefore, the inhibition of HRAS farnesylation can still contribute to FTI antitumour activity in tumours that are addicted to mutant or wild-type HRAS for survival. Thus, it may be worthwhile to design clinical trials that involve FTIs for patients with HRAS-mutant bladder cancers, a tumour that has clearly been understudied so far (TABLES 2, 3).

RHEB as a crucial target for FTIs. Like HRAS, RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB) is exclusively farnesylated⁷⁵. The GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RHEB is the tumour suppressor tuberous sclerosis complex TSC1–TSC2 (REFS 108–110). AKT phosphorylates

and inactivates TSC1–TSC2, causing activation of RHEB¹¹¹⁻¹¹³. RHEB stimulates the protein kinase mTOR, which results in activating phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates S6 kinase (S6K) and eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E-binding protein 1 (4EBP1)¹¹⁴,¹¹⁵, which is consistent with RHEB being essential for cell growth and cell cycle progression in *D. melanogaster*¹¹⁶. RHEB may activate mTOR either by directly binding to it¹¹⁷ or by binding to the mTOR antagonist FKBP38 (also known as FKBP8)¹¹⁸. Most importantly, the ability of RHEB to stimulate mTOR depends on its farnesylation⁷⁵,¹¹⁴. Therefore, cancer cells that are addicted to RHEB may be sensitive to FTIs. For example, this could include tumours that overexpress RHEB or that harbour persistently activated pathways that lead to constitutive RHEB activation (including, PTEN deficiency, PI3K and AKT mutations, AKT overexpression or TSC1–TSC2 deficiency). Consistent with this idea, RHEB is frequently upregulated in transformed cells and human cancer cells⁷⁵,¹¹⁹, and, in several NSCLC cell lines, the ability of FTIs to inhibit proliferation or induce apoptosis depends on RHEB expression levels, which in turn are correlated to the degree of S6K phosphorylation by mTOR⁷⁷. Similarly, RHEB is overexpressed in some

lymphomas, which have increased mTOR activity and enhanced sensitivity to FTIs<sup>120</sup>. The fact that an exclusively geranylgeranylated mutant of RHEB (RHEB-GG) renders PTEN-deficient lymphoma cells resistant to FTIs further supports the idea that the inhibition of RHEB farnesylation contributes to the antitumour activity of FTIs<sup>120</sup>. Similar results were obtained when RHEB-GG was shown to rescue the ability of FTIs to synergize with paclitaxel<sup>75</sup> and cisplatin<sup>77</sup>. As mTOR is an inhibitor of autophagy<sup>121</sup>, and RHEB activates mTOR, it may not be surprising that FTIs can induce autophagy, possibly by blocking RHEB function<sup>122</sup>. The induction of autophagy may be particularly important in cancer cells that are resistant to apoptosis. Collectively, these findings suggest that the inhibition of RHEB farnesylation contributes to the antitumour activity of FTIs, which should perhaps be evaluated in clinical trials for patients with tumours that express high levels of RHEB, as well as for patients with tuberous sclerosis, which is a syndrome caused by the loss of TSC1 or TSC2 function.

**Inhibition of RHOB farnesylation is unlikely to contribute to the antitumour activity of FTIs.** Under physiological conditions, RHOB is found both geranylgeranylated (RHOB-GG), which accounts for 70% of all RHOB, and farnesylated (RHOB-F), which accounts for the remaining 30%, in cells. It has been suggested that the inhibition of RHOB farnesylation accumulates RHOB-GG and contributes to FTI-induced apoptosis<sup>123,124</sup>. Consistent with this, in murine fibroblasts, RHOB-GG but not RHOB-F, suppresses RAS-induced transformation<sup>125</sup>. However, the fact that a large proportion of RHOB is already in the geranylgeranylated form in the absence of FTI treatment argues against a major contribution of inhibition of RHOB farnesylation to FTI antitumour activity. More importantly, in human cancer cells of epithelial origin, both RHOB-F and RHOB-GG have tumour suppressive activity, further arguing against the inhibition of RHOB farnesylation playing a part in FTI antitumour activity<sup>126</sup>. Consistent with RHOB functioning as a tumour suppressor, RHOB is downregulated in several human cancers<sup>127–129</sup>. Although RHOB was shown to be farnesylated *in vitro* by FT, and the treatment of cultured cells with the FTI L-739749 increases the levels of RHOB-GG<sup>130</sup>, the laboratory of Goldstein and Brown has shown using purified components that RHOB is farnesylated by GGT1 but not by FT<sup>131</sup>. This, of course, would disqualify RHOB as a target.

However, FTI treatment activates the RHOB promoter and accumulates large amounts of the RHOB protein<sup>132</sup>. Furthermore, mutant HRAS-transformed *RHOB*<sup>−/−</sup> cells are less sensitive to FTI-induced apoptosis and FTI inhibition of anchorage-dependent but not anchorage-independent tumour growth. Taken together, these results suggest that increased RHOB protein levels, not inhibition of RHOB farnesylation, may contribute to some of the effects of FTIs<sup>133</sup>.

**Alternative approaches**

*RCE1 and ICMT inhibitors.* Interestingly, prenylation seems to be constitutive, but prenylated proteins can undergo up to three additional PTMs, the last two of which are reversible (BOX 1). First, the last three C-terminal amino acids, aaX, are proteolytically removed by RAS-converting enzyme 1 (RCE1)<sup>139</sup>. Second, the carboxyl group in the now C-terminal prenylated cysteine is methylated by isoprenylcysteine carboxyl methyltransferase (ICMT)<sup>140</sup>. Third, many prenylated proteins become palmitoylated on upstream cysteines by membrane-bound palmitoyl transferases<sup>141</sup>. The carboxymethylation, which neutralizes the carboxyl negative charge, coupled with the palmitoylation, further stabilizes membrane association and anchoring.

RCE1 and ICMT, which function downstream of PTs, have also attracted attention as potential targets for cancer therapy. Conditional lack of *Rce1* expression in skin carcinoma cells that express activated HRAS has much less severe effects on cell proliferation than the effect of lonafarnib<sup>142</sup>. By contrast, conditional deletion of *Icmt* efficiently blocks transformation by either human KRAS-G12V or human BRAF-V599E oncogenic mutants<sup>140</sup>. Considering these results, ICMT inhibitors are more likely to be successful than RCE1 inhibitors. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of ICMT inhibits the growth of HepG2 tumour xenografts in nude mice<sup>143</sup>. As postprenylation inhibitors will affect both farnesylated and geranylgeranylated proteins, these drugs may be more toxic than FTIs or GGTIs.

**Other possible targets.** PTIs are bound to have effects not only on oncogenic RAS family members, but also on other prenylated proteins some of which are not yet known. Some candidate targets for prenylation include tumour suppressors, ARHI (also known as NOEY2 and DIRAS3)<sup>134</sup>, RAS-related and oestrogen-regulated growth inhibitor (RERG)<sup>135</sup>, deleted in breast cancer 2 (DBC2; also known as RHOBTB2)<sup>136</sup>, RAS-related inhibitor of cell growth (RIG)<sup>137</sup>, RAS-related protein on chromosome 22 (RRP22; also known as RASL10A)<sup>138</sup> and maybe others. The non-discriminatory action of PTIs may abrogate crucially important tumour suppressor functions and may at least partially compromise their effects on oncogenic pathways. Therefore, it needs to be established whether the proteins mentioned above are exclusively farnesylated or geranylgeranylated, and whether their prenylation is crucial to their growth inhibitory function. For proteins that pass these tests it is recommended that their functional status is assessed in future clinical trials.

The inhibition of the farnesylation of several other proteins could contribute to the antitumour activity of FTIs. These include CENPE, CENPF, the PRL phosphatases PRL1 (also known as PTP4A1), PRL2 (also known as PTP4A2) and PRL3 (also known as PTP4A3), lamins A and B, HDJ2, RND3, peroxisomal biogenesis factor 19 (PEX19), RHOD, RHO6, RHO7 (also known as RHON), TC10 (also known as RHOQ) and prostacyclin receptor (PTGIR). Although some of these may be associated with known effects of FTIs such as the possible role that CENPE and CENPF and PRLs may have in FTI-induced mitotic arrest, the contributions of others require further investigations.

Prenylome
The subset of proteins in a cell or organism that is modified by prenylation.

---

**Prenylated proteins that are phosphorylated.** Several small GTPases are subject to reversible phosphorylation. For example, protein kinase C (PKC)- or PKA-mediated phosphorylation of CDC42, KRAS, RAP1A and RHOA induces their removal from the cell membrane<sup>144–147</sup>. The question is whether this relocation translates into a loss or change of function. With regard to KRAS, this has recently been investigated. Interestingly, PKC-mediated phosphorylation of Ser181 in KRAS promotes its relocation to mitochondrial membranes where it associates with BCL-X<sub>L</sub> (also known as BCL2L1) and promotes apoptosis. Overexpression of KRAS-S181E is sufficient to induce apoptosis, an effect that is rescued by co-transfection with BCL-2 (REF. 145). This raises the intriguing possibility that PKC agonists such as bryostatin 1<sup>145</sup> may be more efficient for killing and/or less toxic to KRAS-dependent tumours than PTIs. Phosphorylation of RAB6, RHOB and RALA activates their function<sup>148–151</sup>. Most interestingly, aurora kinase A enhances, and protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) inhibits, the transforming activity of RALA<sup>150,151</sup>. Provided that activating phosphorylation can occur independently of prenylation, these findings may indicate that GGTI-mediated inhibition of RALA may not be sufficient to completely block its transforming ability. However, these findings also suggest that GGTIs that inhibit RALA might synergize with aurora kinase A inhibitors or with PP2A agonists. Phosphorylation of CDC42, RHOB and RHEB inhibits their function<sup>152–154</sup>, cautioning against combinations of PTIs and protein kinase inhibitors to target CDC42- or RHEB-dependent tumours.

**Synthetic lethality.** As is well documented, many human cancers depend on oncogenic KRAS for survival, and this dependency confers a vulnerability that is unique to these cancer cells. Indeed, recent unbiased RNA interference-based screens<sup>155–159</sup> and other approaches<sup>160</sup> identified six genes the knockdown of which kills only human tumours that depend on mutant KRAS. Such a synthetically lethal strategy would be of benefit if some of the identified targets are more druggable than KRAS (see Supplementary information S6 (figure)). Of the six studies cited above, the one identifying the lethal interaction between oncogenic KRAS and CDK4 is particularly interesting<sup>160</sup>. It has been previously reported that RAS-mediated transformation requires the expression of functional RB in mouse fibroblasts<sup>161</sup>. This is consistent with the fact that activated RAS induces cyclin D1 (REF. 162), which activates CDK4 and other kinases and ultimately leads to inhibitory phosphorylation of RB, thus permitting the G1/S transition<sup>163</sup>. These considerations might explain why human tumours very rarely display loss-of-function mutations in RB together with activating RAS mutations<sup>164</sup>. Furthermore, they provide a rationale for investigating whether PTIs and CDK inhibitors act in a synergistic fashion, both in animals and in clinical trials.

Considering the enormous number of proteins affected by the RAS signalling network, we predict that further synthetic lethal interactions will be identified. For example, small interfering RNA (siRNA) screens silencing protein kinases or protein phosphatases may reveal molecular targets the inhibition of which sensitizes cancer cells to PTIs. Conversely, siRNA screens silencing the prenylome may reveal crucial prenylated proteins the inhibition of which sensitizes cancer cells to drugs that target other signal transduction pathways; for example, PI3K–AKT, RAF–MEK–MAPK and CDKs.

**Future directions and challenges**

Despite the conceptual advances that have been made over the past decade, in our opinion, the major challenge in this field is the following question: which PT substrates are crucial for the proliferation or survival of different cancer types? Or, in other words, does the antitumour activity of PTIs in a given tumour depend on the inhibition of certain prenylated proteins? At present, the exact size of the prenylome is unknown<sup>165</sup>. Although more than 100 proteins have been experimentally confirmed to undergo prenylation<sup>166</sup>, a recent search of the UniProt database (release 20 April 2010; see Further information) returned 587 human genes that encode proteins bearing a C-terminal CXXX motif. Although not all of these proteins will qualify as PT substrates, this suggests that many prenylated proteins have not yet been identified.

Current standard methods to characterize protein prenylation are, for the most part, designed to follow individual proteins<sup>167</sup> and are thus not practical to address the above questions. Therefore, this field should develop and streamline techniques that are capable of analysing prenylation on a global scale, in a manner that is reasonably rapid, feasible and convenient for many laboratories. As a step towards characterizing the entire prenylome, Maurer-Stroh *et al.*<sup>165</sup> have recently developed a sequence-based software suite that is designed to predict whether proteins hitherto unknown to be prenylated are likely to be modified by FT, GGT1 and/or GGT2. Combining this with approaches that uncover actual prenylation patterns in various cancer cells, as well as changes in prenylation patterns in response to PTIs, will eventually reveal which prenylated proteins the inhibition of which is responsible for the antitumour effects of PTIs and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment with these inhibitors. Several techniques pursuing this goal have recently been described<sup>168–173</sup>. For example, labelling cells with modified tractable prenyl donors in lieu of the natural farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) or geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) is a step in that direction. This can involve the labelling of cells with azido-farnesyl, followed by the affinity purification of farnesylated proteins with a biotinylated phosphine capture reagent<sup>168</sup>. Similarly, labelling cells with azido-GG analogues, followed by the selective labelling of the resulting azido-GG proteins with a modified rhodamine, can be used to detect geranylgeranylated proteins by fluorescent imaging<sup>172</sup>.

It is our belief that proteome-wide or prenylome-wide approaches, such as those discussed above, are urgently needed to identify the subsets of prenylated proteins that are affected by FTIs and/or GGTIs, which in turn should help to link the physiological effects of various PTIs to their molecular targets, and thus will help to design improved clinical trials.

References 155–160 are particularly important as they identify novel promising targets for cancer patients whose tumours depend on KRAS for survival. Importantly, the four protein kinases identified are not essential for the survival of normal cells, but their loss of function in combination with activated KRAS is synthetically lethal. Reference 159 also emphasizes the point that not all KRAS-mutant cell lines are addicted to KRAS, suggesting that in a subset of tumours, KRAS may not be a suitable target.

This paper describes methods to better predict whether a potentially prenylatable protein is a substrate for FT, GGT1 or GGT2. These take into account the requirement for specific residues within the CaaX box, evolutionary conservation of the prenylation motif across phyla and physicochemical constraints extending up to 11 residues upstream of the prenylatable Cys.

References 168–173 considerably advance our abilities to describe the effects of PTIs on the entire prenylome rather than just individual proteins. This is needed to identify prenylated proteins the inhibition of which contributes to the antitumour effects of PTIs.

Although when references 174 and 175 were published it was unknown that RAS is farnesylated, these studies are important as they demonstrated that the C terminus of RAS is essential for both its membrane binding and its transforming activity.
