Taste buds are unusual in requiring ATP as a transmitter to activate sensory nerve fibers. In response to taste stimuli, taste cells release ATP, activating purinergic receptors containing the P2X2 and P2X3 subunits on taste nerves. In turn, the released ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP by a plasma membrane nucleoside triphosphatase previously identified as nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-2 (NTPDase2). In this paper we investigate the role of this ectonucleotidase in the function of taste buds by examining gene-targeted *Entpd2*-null mice globally lacking NTPDase2. RT-PCR confirmed the absence of NTPDase2, and ATPase enzyme histochemistry reveals no reaction product in taste buds of knockout mice, suggesting that NTPDase2 is the dominant form in taste buds. RT-PCR and immunocytochemistry demonstrated that in knockout mice all cell types are present in taste buds, even those cells normally expressing NTPDase2. In addition, the overall number and size of taste buds are normal in *Entpd2*-null mice. Luciferin/luciferase assays of circumvallate tissue of knockout mice detected elevated levels of extracellular ATP. Electrophysiological recordings from two taste nerves, the chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal, revealed depressed responses to all taste stimuli in *Entpd2*-null mice. Responses were more depressed in the glossopharyngeal nerve than in the chorda tympani nerve and involved all taste qualities; responses in the chorda tympani were more depressed to sweet and umami stimuli than to other qualities. We suggest that the excessive levels of extracellular ATP in the *Entpd2*-knockout animals desensitize the P2X receptors associated with nerve fibers, thereby depressing taste responses.

of sour and salty substances and are the only taste cells that possess conventional synaptic contacts with afferent nerve fibers (13–17). Type I cells, generally considered to have a support or “glial-like” function because they wrap around the other cell types, are the cells that express NTPDase2 (18–19).

Once ATP is released into the extracellular space within a taste bud, it activates purinergic receptors on other taste cells as well as the ionotropic purinergic receptors on the taste nerves composed of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits. Various taste cells express ionotropic P2X2 and P2X7 receptors (20, 21) and metabotropic P2Y1 (22, 23), P2Y2, and P2Y4 (24) receptors. After release, ATP is degraded via NTPDase2 to ADP, which itself can activate the P2Y receptors. The ADP then is further degraded to AMP and finally to adenosine via other and less specific ectonucleotidases including ecto-5′-nucleotidase expressed in type III cells (25).

In this study we have focused on the role of NTPDase2 in regulating synaptic function in taste buds. We report that genetic deletion of NTPDase2 results in the accumulation of ATP in the taste tissues and a concomitant significant decrease of neural taste responses, likely because of receptor desensitization.

### Results

#### Characterization of *Entpd2*-Null Mice.
We used molecular, histochemical, and anatomical measures to determine the effects of the genetic deletion of *Entpd2* on taste epithelia (Fig. 1). First, we used RT-PCR to test for expression of NTPDase2 mRNA in pooled taste buds isolated from fungiform and circumvallate papillae. As shown in Fig. 1B, genetic deletion of *Entpd2* effectively eliminated expression of NTPDase2 mRNA in taste buds.

### Significance

ATP, a ubiquitous source of energy for all cells, also serves as an important messenger for intercellular communication. This role as a signal molecule is especially crucial for taste buds, which release ATP to trigger purinergic receptors on the taste nerves. Normally, the released ATP is degraded by a specific enzyme, nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase-2 (NTPDase2). We find that genetic elimination of NTPDase2 results in accumulation of ATP in extracellular space, thereby desensitizing the receptors on nerve fibers. The result is a loss of transmission of taste information from taste buds to the taste nerves. Disruption of taste function may be an unintended consequence of pharmaceutical agents now being developed to target purinergic receptors and enzymes as treatments for chronic pain and other illnesses.

To determine whether all three types of taste cells were present in the taste buds of the KO mice, we used RT-PCR to test for expression of taste cell-specific markers: glutamate aspartate transporter (GLAST) for type I cells; α-gustducin, transient receptor potential melastatin 5 (TRPM5), and phospholipase Cβ2 (PLCβ2) for type II cells; and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25) for type III cells. As shown in Fig. 1C, PCR products representing all three cell types are present in both circumvallate and fungiform taste buds of the KO mice. In addition, to verify that NTPDase2 is the only ectoATPase present and functional in taste buds, we compared ectoATPase activity in circumvallate papillae of WT and *Entpd2*-KO animals. Use of two different substrates, ADP and ATP, allowed us to distinguish specific ectoATPase staining representing NTPDase2 or NTPDase8 (26) from less specific nucleotidases that degrade ADP as well as ATP. As expected, in WT animals, dense reaction product forms within taste buds when ATP but not ADP is used as substrate, demonstrating the high specificity for the ectonucleotide in taste buds, commensurate with the expression of NTPDase2. In contrast, in *Entpd2*-KO animals, no ectoATPase activity was detected in the taste buds (Fig. 2 A–D) with ATP as a substrate, confirming the major role of NTPDase2 in the degradation of ATP in this system. In both WT and *Entpd2* KO lines, the nerve bundles beneath taste buds exhibited nucleotidase activity when ADP was used as a substrate, indicating the presence of a different nucleotidase in and around these nerve bundles (Fig. 2 E–H).

Tissue Levels of ATP. Because NTPDase2 degrades extracellular ATP, we used a luciferin/luciferase assay to test whether mice lacking this enzyme have elevated levels of ATP in epithelium isolated from the circumvallate taste papillae. Indeed, significantly more ATP was present in the extracellular solution surrounding the *Entpd2*-null taste tissue than in the WT tissues (*P* < 0.05; *t* test) (Table 1). These data suggest that in the absence of NTPDase2 to degrade ATP, this nucleotide accumulates significantly in the extracellular microenvironment. Stimulation of the apical membrane with a mixture of bitter tastants (20 mM denatonium + 100 μM cycloheximide) evokes ATP release in WT mice, but the KO mice fail to release detectable levels of ATP over background levels (Table 1).

Nerve Recordings. To determine if genetic deletion of *Entpd2* affects synaptic function in the taste bud, we measured responses to taste stimuli with whole-nerve recordings from chorda tympani and glossopharyngeal nerves in WT and *Entpd2*-null animals. In both nerves, KO animals showed reduced responses to all taste qualities. Because the response to 100 mM NH₄Cl, which often is used as a reference, was decreased also, we normalized responses to the baseline immediately before stimulation to compare responses in different mice. In the chorda tympani (Fig. 4), the genotype factor is significant for all tastants except NaCl, quinine, and NH₄Cl (two-way ANOVA, *P* < 0.05). Taken individually, the responses to sucrose (300 mM, 500 mM, and 1 M), and monosodium glutamate (MSG) with amiloride (100 mM, 300 mM, and 500 mM) were significantly smaller in KO (62–77% decrease) than in WT animals (Student *t* test, *P* < 0.05). Responses to HCl and citric acid also were decreased in KO mice (28–59% of WT response), but the decrease was not statistically significant. In the glossopharyngeal nerve (Fig. 5), the genotype factor is significant for all tastants (two-way ANOVA, *P* < 0.05), and individual concentrations of all taste qualities except 3 mM quinine and 5 mM citric acid) were reduced significantly in the KO animals (51–100% decrease compared with WT), including acids and NaCl. These results suggest that the lack of degradation of ATP and its accumulation in the taste tissue of *Entpd2*-KO mice decreases responses to all taste qualities.

To determine if genetic deletion of *Entpd2* affected the morphology of gustatory papillae, we measured the size of the circumvallate papillae of four KO and four WT mice. The overall papilla size was ∼15% smaller (*t* test; *P* < 0.05) in the KO mice than in their WT counterparts (Table S1). In two individuals of each genotype from this group, we also measured the size and total number of taste buds. Despite the difference in size of the papillae, the size of taste buds (average diameter 37.1 μm for WT and 37.48 μm for KO) and total number of taste buds (WT = 121–137; KO = 126–148) was not different between genotypes (Table S1). To determine if the KO and WT mice have a similar complement of cell types, we used immunohistochemistry with antibodies specific to individual taste cell types (GLAST for type I taste cells, α-gustducin for type II cells, and SNAP25 for type III cells). All markers were present in taste buds of the two strains (Fig. 3), indicating that, despite the genetic deletion of NTPDase2 from type I cells, taste buds in both WT and KO lines still contain all three major taste cell types. In summary, the morphology of taste buds is similar in the WT and KO lines, so differences in function cannot be attributed to gross differences in taste bud number or structure.

In contrast, P2X2/3 heteromers show less desensitization, with the degree of desensitization being determined by the number of P2X3-containing subunits in the receptor (30).

The extracellular solution surrounding the unstimulated taste tissue in the Entpd2-null mice contains high nanomolar concentrations of ATP—levels consistent with the desensitization of P2X3 homomers, suggesting that chronic desensitization of P2X3 (and concurrently P2X2) may cause the decreased responsiveness observed in the Entpd2-null mice. The differential distribution of P2X2 and P2X3 subunits between the two taste nerves may explain the taste specificity of the effect. For example, if P2X3 homotrimers were expressed selectively on nerve fibers that contact sweet- and umami-sensitive taste cells, then these fibers would be more affected by high levels of extracellular ATP than would fibers expressing P2X2/3 heteromers. Interestingly, in P2X3 single-KO mice responses to sweet stimuli are more impaired than responses to bitter stimuli (1), suggesting that any differential distribution of P2X subunits may correlate with specificity of taste cell innervation.

Similarly, the effects of the NTPDase2 knockout on taste responsiveness were not uniform across the two taste nerves studied. In the chorda tympani nerve, which innervates fungiform papillae of the anterior tongue, responses to sweet and

## Discussion

The principal finding in this study is that genetic deletion of NTPDase2, the only ectoATPase expressed in taste buds, results in decreased neural responses to taste stimuli. Because taste bud numbers and taste cell types were unaffected by the knockout, the decrease in responsiveness presumably reflects the lack of degradation and elevated tissue levels of ATP. Because ATP activation of P2X receptors on the gustatory nerve fibers is required for neurotransmission in the taste system, we suggest that genetic deletion of the ectoATPase results in a disruption of purinergic transmission at this crucial synapse.

What is the mechanism of the decreased responsiveness? Desensitization of purinergic receptors on the taste nerve fibers seems a likely explanation. The nerve fibers express purinergic receptors containing P2X2 and P2X3 subunits (2), both of which adapt to prolonged (~60 s) exposure to ATP, with P2X3 adapting more rapidly than P2X2 (27). Although both P2X2 and P2X3 can form homotrimeric receptors, they also tend to form heteromers when coexpressed in a single cell. P2X3 is expressed by nearly all ganglionic neurons of the chorda tympani nerve, whereas P2X2 is expressed on only 50–60% of these ganglion cells (28). Thus, ganglion cells expressing only P2X23 produce P2X3 homomeric receptors, whereas other cells expressing both P2X2 and P2X3 generate mostly heteromeric receptors (29). In either case, P2X3 is a component of the receptors expressed on gustatory afferent fibers. Responses elicited by P2X3

The reduction of extracellular ADP in the KO mice not only reduces the activation of P2Y receptors but also decreases the production of adenosine generated from ADP by nonspecific ectonucleotidases including ecto-5′-nucleotidase (25). Adenosine acting via the A2B receptor, which is expressed selectively on sweet-responsive taste cells of the posterior tongue, is required for normal sweet taste responses in circumvallate taste buds (25, 32). Activation of the A2B receptor elevates intracellular $ \text{Ca}^{2+} $, thereby enhancing ATP release to sweet stimuli. Thus, lowered levels of extracellular adenosine in the KO mice may contribute to the decrease in sweet responsiveness in glossopharyngeal-innervated taste fields. However, A2B is not expressed in anterior tongue, so this mechanism cannot account for the decreased sweet responses in the chorda tympani nerve.

All neurotransmitter systems rely on the effective removal of synaptically released transmitter for maintaining proper synaptic function. However, in many cases failure to remove transmitter, either by inhibiting the uptake mechanism or by blocking the degradative enzyme, enhances postsynaptic responses. For example, serotonin reuptake inhibitors prolong the lifetime of serotonin at the synapse, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the serotonin. In the case of ATP as a transmitter in taste buds, our data suggest that rather than enhancing synaptic transmission, failure to remove ATP results in depressed synaptic transmission.

Similar modulation of purinergic receptor function occurs after deletion of another related ectonucleotidase, as in Entpd1-null (Cd39/-) mice (33). NTPDase1 is expressed at the sympathetic neuromuscular junction, where ATP is co-released with

Experiments included the use of WT and Entpd2-null mice (both in C57BL6 background) generated at GenOway.

**Generation of Mutant Mice.** Entpd2-null mice were created using a targeting construct that deletes exons I and II including the promoter region by homologous recombination in murine ES cells derived from 129sv mice (Fig. 1). Recombination in the ES cells was confirmed by Southern blot analysis both on 5′ and 3′ regions using probes generated by PCR ([Fig. S1](#)). The primer sets used to generate probes were ggtccttgcccatgagtgtc and gaacaggcaagga- caaraggc for the 5′ side and aagacacaggagagactcagcag and ccaagaaagg- cagaaaatacac for the 3′ side. The targeted ES cells were used to create chimeric mice that transmit the targeted allele through their germ lines. The resultant mutant mice were screened by PCR and backcrossed six times onto the C57BL6tac background to create homozygous deletion mice in which the gene deletion was validated by PCR and immunohistochemistry. The Entpd2- null mice are viable and fertile; no gross morphological or behavioral abnormalities are obvious. Interbreeding the heterozygote mouse yielded offspring at a WT:heterozygous:KO ratio of 1:1.9:1.1 (*n* = 125), suggesting Mendelian inheritance of the deletion.

**RT-PCR.** RT-PCR was used to validate the absence of NTPDase2 mRNA and to test whether expression of other taste-related genes was affected in the Entpd2-null mouse. Tissue was isolated from the fungiform and circumval- late papillae pooled from six adult C57/Bl6 mice and six Entpd2-null mice. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy Mini kit from Qiagen according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Reverse transcription was performed using the iScript cDNA Synthesis kit from Bio-Rad. All primers spanned at least one intron to control for genomic DNA contamination ([Table S2](#)). PCR products were sequenced and compared with published sequences using BLAST (National Center for Biotechnology Information). Over the regions se- quenced, there was 100% identity between our PCR product and published sequences for NTPDase2, GLAST, α-gustducin, TRPM5, PLCβ2, and SNAP25.

**ATPase Histochemistry.** Entpd2-KO and C57/Bl6 mice were anesthetized and perfused transcardially with saline followed by fixative consisting of 2% (wt/vol) paraformaldehyde, 0.2% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M Tris-maleate buffer (pH7.4) with 0.2 mM CaCl₂. After cryoprotection overnight, cryostat sections of the tongue (12–16 μm) were processed for specific ATPase histochemistry using a reaction solution containing 1 mM levamisole, 1 mM ouabain, 50 uM αβ-methylene ADP, 2 mM CaCl₂, in Tris-maleate buffer (pH 7.4) along with either 0.94 mM ATP or 0.85 mM ADP as substrates. After exposure to ammonium sulfide, the tissue was stained with a Giemsa counterstain, dehy- drated, and coverslipped with Permount (Fisher Scientific).

**Morphometrics.** For quantitative anatomy, all sections were cut at 12 μm and collected in a series with spacing of 144 μm between sections. Measurements of staining intensity and papillary size were performed using ImageJ soft- ware v. 1.46r (National Institutes of Health) on sections from four different individuals of each strain. Because small but significant differences in pap- illary size existed between the two lines, we tested whether the taste buds were different sizes and whether there were different numbers of taste buds in the two lines. For these counts, we carried out detailed morpho- metric measures on two individuals of each line. We calculated the total number of taste buds per papilla by applying the Abercrombie correction factor to the raw counts of taste buds in the samples. Calculated values were similar to figures obtained previously by other investigators (38). See [SI Materials and Methods](#) for technical details.

**Immunohistochemistry.** Entpd2-KO and WT mice were deeply anesthetized and perfused using periodate-lysine-paraformaldehyde fixative (75 mM ly- sine, 1.6% paraformaldehyde, 10 mM NaIO₄ in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4). After 1.5 h postfix and cryoprotection, 12- to 16-μm cryostat sections were cut and mounted onto slides. After buffer washes, antigen retrieval was preformed as necessary using 10 mM sodium citrate (pH 9.0) at 80 °C for 25 min followed by exposure to 3% H₂O₂. Specific primary antibodies for each cell type then were applied to the sections. We used guinea pig anti- GLAST (1:1,000) (AB1782; Chemicon) for type I taste cells; rabbit anti-Gα- gustducin (1:2,500) (SC-395; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) for type II cells; and rabbit anti-SNAP25 (1:5,000) (Sigma) for type III cells. Primary antibody binding was revealed using an avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex followed by a tyramide detection system; double labeling was performed using indirect immunofluorescence after the tyramide reaction. Images were collected using a confocal laser-scanning microscope FV300 (Olympus Fluoview) and were adjusted with Photoshop for brightness and gamma. See [SI Materials and Methods](#) for details.

Luciferin/Luciferase Assay. To measure the concentration of ATP present surrounding the taste tissue, a piece of lingual epithelium containing the circumvallate papilla was peeled after enzymatic treatment with 3 mg/mL Dispase II (Roche) and 3 mg/mL elastase for 18 min. The epithelium then was placed in a modified Ussing chamber made of a plastic sheet with the basal part of the circumvallate papilla coming through a small hole in contact with the Tyrode's bathing solution (45 μL). The apical part of the epithelium was stimulated for three consecutive 1-min periods with (5 μL) Tyrode's bathing solution as a control, followed by three consecutive 1-min stimulations with a tastant bitter mix (20 mM denatonium + 100 μM cycloheximide in Tyrode's bathing solution). The bathing solution then was collected and transferred to a 96-well plate for luminescence reading. A plate reader (Synergy HT; Biotek) equipped with an injector added the same amount of luciferase reagent (ATP Bioluminescence Assay Kit HS II; Roche) to each well and performed the reading. In parallel, an ATP curve was obtained from known ATP concentrations and was used to convert the arbitrary values obtained with the taste tissue to ATP concentrations. The Tyrode's bathing solution contained (in mM) 140 NaCl, 5 KCl, 4 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, 10 glucose, 1 Na-Pyruvate, 10 Hepes, adjusted to pH 7.4 with NaOH. ATP release in WT and KO animals was compared using a Student t test (*P* < 0.05) (GraphPad Prism 5).

Nerve Recordings. Mice were anesthetized with an i.p. injection of sodium pentobarbital (50 mg/kg). The animals were maintained in a head holder, and the trachea was cannulated to facilitate breathing. The chorda tympani nerve was exposed using a ventral approach free from surrounding tissue and was cut near the tympanic bulla. The glossopharyngeal nerve was exposed after removal of the digastric muscle and was cut near its entrance to the posterior foramen. For recording, the nerve was placed on a platinum-iridium wire electrode, and a reference electrode was placed in the nearby tissue. Responses were fed to an amplifier, integrated (time constant 0.5 s) and were recorded using AcqKnowledge software (Biopac) for offline analysis. For stimulation, fungiform papillae or circumvallate papillae were exposed to different taste stimuli applied with a medium constant flow pump (Fisher Scientific). The taste stimuli were prepared in water: NH₄Cl 100 mM, sucrose 300–1,000 mM, MSG 100–500 mM + amiloride (100 μM), quinine 3–20 mM, denatonium 10–30 mM, NaCl 30–300 mM, citric acid 3–20 mM, HCl 3–20 mM. The stimuli were applied for 30 s (chorda tympani nerve) or 60 s (glossopharyngeal nerve), and the tongue was rinsed with water for 50 s between successive stimulations. For data analysis, the amplitude of the integrated response for each stimulation was averaged for 30 s (chorda tympani nerve) or 60 s (glossopharyngeal nerve) using AcqKnowledge software and was normalized to the baseline to reduce the variability across animals. The normalized nerve responses were compared between WT and NTPDase-KO mice using two-way ANOVA, and each individual concentration was compared with an unpaired Student *t* test (*P* < 0.05) (GraphPad Prism 5).
