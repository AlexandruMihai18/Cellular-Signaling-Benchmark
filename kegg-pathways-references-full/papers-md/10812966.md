## 1. Introduction

Neurotrophins represent a family of survival and differentiation factors that exert profound effects in the central and peripheral nervous systems (Levi-Montalcini, 1987; Barde, 1989; Thoenen, 1995). Nerve growth factor (NGF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3), and neurotrophin-4/5 (NT-4) associate as non-covalent homodimers in a biologically active form. These target-derived trophic factors are active on distinct sets of embryonic neurons, whose dependence is restricted in duration during development (Davies, 1994). Neurotrophins have been proposed as therapeutic agents for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders and nerve injury, either individually or in combination with other trophic factors, such as ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), insulin-like growth factor and fibroblast growth factor (Lindsay et al., 1994; Nishi, 1994). Recent clinical efforts have met with disappointing results. Improvements in overcoming difficulties of delivery and pharmacokinetics in the central nervous system will provide more impetus for the application of neurotrophins for neurodegenerative diseases. An understanding of the mechanisms of neurotrophin action will provide insights into the use of these proteins therapeutically.

Responsiveness of neurons to neurotrophins is governed by the expression of two classes of cell surface receptors (Chao, 1992a). For NGF, they are p75<sup>NTR</sup> (p75) and the TrkA receptor tyrosine kinase. Three vertebrate *trk* receptor genes have been isolated, including numerous variants of *trk* structure (Barbacid, 1994). The related TrkB receptor tyrosine kinase binds both BDNF and NT-4, the most closely related neurotrophins from phylogenetic analysis, while TrkC receptor binds only NT-3. NT-3 can also bind to the TrkA receptor. The p75 receptor binds to all neurotrophins with similar affinities, but different kinetics (Rodriguez-Tebar et al., 1992). Hence, the neurotrophins can engage two separate receptors, which can act independently, or interact with each other.

The mechanism of action of neurotrophins has provided a challenging and formidable problem in signal transduction. In addition to promoting cell differentiation and survival, neurotrophins can induce cell death under certain conditions. Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain how NGF might act as a trophic factor and as a cell killer (Casaccia-Bonnefil et al., 1998). The survival and cell death properties of the receptors are dependent upon the relative ratio of receptors and the duration of the signalling events. Here we provide evidence that neurotrophin receptors exist as preformed multi-subunit complexes. Such complex formation by transmembrane receptors is likely to dictate biological responsiveness to neurotrophins.

## 2. Neurotrophin structure

Neurotrophins are produced as precursor proteins, which are cleaved at dibasic amino acids to form a mature form of 118–120 amino acids (Angeletti and Bradshaw, 1971; Leibrock et al., 1989; Maisonpierre et al., 1990). The X-ray crystal structure of NGF has been solved and provides a structural model for this family (McDonald et al., 1991). The conservation of structural features indicates that the neurotrophins will adopt similar conformations to that of NGF.

The dimeric NGF possesses a novel tertiary fold that results in a flat asymmetric molecule with dimensions of 60 Å by 25 Å by 30 Å (McDonald et al., 1991). Each NGF subunit is characterized by two pairs of anti-parallel β-strands that contribute to the molecule's flat, elongated shape. These β-strands are connected at one end of the neurotrophin by three short loops. These loops are known to be highly flexible and represent the regions in the neurotrophin structure where many amino acid differences exist between the neurotrophins.

The three disulfide bridges in each neurotrophin are clustered at the one end of the molecule and provide rigidity to the structure. The arrangement of the disulfide linkages is unusual. The disulfide bridges and their connecting residues form a ring structure and a tightly packed cystine knot motif (McDonald and Hendrickson, 1993). This cystine knot allows the two pairs of β-strands from each neurotrophin to pack against each other, generating an extensive subunit interface. The interface has a largely hydrophobic character comprised primarily of aromatic residues, consistent with the tight association constant (10<sup>13</sup> M) measured for NGF. The NGF tertiary fold and “cystine knot” motif have been identified in structures of transforming growth factor β (TGF-β), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and more recently in human chorionic gonadotrophin (McDonald and Hendrickson, 1993). Members of this diverse structural superfamily of ligands typically form homo- or hetero-dimeric species.

The structural features of the neurotrophin family, in particular the dimer interface, are highly conserved, as evidenced in the ability of these members to form dimers

in vitro (Arakawa et al., 1994; Jungbluth et al., 1994; Radziewjewski and Robinson, 1993). These heterodimeric proteins give functional activity in many cases, indicating there is overall compatibility of these structures.

## 3. Neurotrophin receptors

The neurotrophins are unusual among polypeptide growth factors in that two different transmembrane proteins serve as receptors for each neurotrophin. The structural features of Trk tyrosine kinases and the p75 neurotrophin receptor are displayed in Fig. 1. The Trk subfamily of receptor tyrosine kinases is distinguished by immunoglobulin-C2 domains and repeats rich in leucine and cysteine residues in the extracellular domain and a tyrosine kinase domain with a small interruption and a short cytoplasmic tail.

The p75 receptor contains four negatively charged cysteine-rich extracellular repeats, and a unique cytoplasmic domain which is highly conserved among species. There are no sequence similarities between the Trk and p75 receptors, in either ligand binding or cytoplasmic domains. The p75 receptor is the founding member of a superfamily of receptors, exemplified by tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and the Fas receptor (Smith et al., 1994). The TNF family of receptors is defined by canonical cysteine-rich domains in the extracellular region. Each cysteine-rich domain folds independently and is stabilized by extensive intrachain disulfide bonding. Other members include the lymphoid

Fig. 1. Transmembrane receptors for NGF. Whereas the TrkA receptor is a member of the tyrosine kinase family of receptors, the p75 neurotrophin receptor belongs to the TNF superfamily of receptors. A schematic representation of the TrkA and the p75 neurotrophin receptor is shown, together with their substrates and adaptor proteins. Trk adaptor proteins include FRS II (Kouhara et al., 1997) and SH2B (Qian et al., 1998). Signal transduction by the neurotrophins involves recruitment of enzymatic activities, such as phosphatidylinositol 3′ kinase (PI3-K) and phospholipase C-γ for TrkA (Kaplan and Stephens, 1994) and TRAF6 for p75 (Khursigara et al., 1999).

cell-specific receptor CD30, CD40, CD27, and other diverse members, such as DR-3, DR-4, CAR-1 and GITR (Smith et al., 1994; Brojatsch et al., 1996; Chinnaiyan et al., 1996; Montgomery et al., 1996; Pan et al., 1997). All of these transmembrane proteins share in their extracellular domains a cysteine motif that spans 40 amino acids and is repeated two to six times.

Each class of receptors undergoes ligand-induced dimerization (Grob et al., 1985; Jing et al., 1992) that activates multiple signal transduction pathways. Neurotrophin binding to Trk family members produces biological responses through activation of the tyrosine kinase domain resulting in a rapid increase in the phosphorylation of selected effector enzymes, such as phospholipase C-γ and phosphatidylinositol 3'-kinase, PI3-K (Fig. 1). Increased ras activity, a common signal from all tyrosine kinase receptors, results from the stimulation of guanine nucleotide exchange factors coupled to SHC adaptor proteins which directly interact with Trk after ligand binding (Kaplan and Stephens, 1994). The p75 receptor signals via pathways involved with activation of sphingomyelinase activities (Dobrowsky et al., 1994), NFκB (Carter et al., 1996) and c-jun N-terminal Kinase, JNK (Casaccia-Bonnefil et al., 1996). More crucially, expression of p75 modulates Trk signalling activity at low concentration of neurotrophins (Barker and Shooter, 1994; Hantzopoulos et al., 1994; Verdi et al., 1994).

The substrates for neurotrophin Trk receptors-phospholipase C-γ, PI3-K SHC and Grb2 adaptor proteins-are utilized by many tyrosine kinase receptors. This raises the question of how these phosphorylation events lead to different biological outcomes (Chao, 1992b). There are several possibilities. First, the strength and duration of the receptor autophosphorylation events may determine downstream signalling outcomes. Second, differential signalling may be controlled by specific dephosphorylation events. Third, there may be unique second messengers or substrates which determine the specific nature of the response.

For neurotrophin factors, the timing of signalling has provided an important criteria for differential signalling. In PC12 cells, NGF induces a prolonged activation of Ras and MAP kinase activity, lasting for several hours, while EGF-mediated MAP kinase activation is transient in nature (Qui and Green, 1991, 1992). The duration signalling is one of the major differences that accounts for the differentiation program elicited by NGF vs. the action of other mitogenic growth factors, such as EGF. However, the magnitude of receptor signalling is not sufficient. Ligand-dependent autophosphorylation of the EGF receptor is higher than that of the TrkA NGF receptor in PC12 cells (Berg et al., 1992). Since EGF does not elicit neuronal differentiation as NGF, the level of receptor activation cannot solely account for the difference in trophic factor action.

Another mechanism is the recruitment of receptor substrates such as docking or adaptor proteins. FRS-2/SNT is

an highly phosphorylated protein that contains an NH₂-terminal myristylation site, a phophotyrosine binding (PTB) domain and binding sites for SH2 and SH3 containing proteins (Kouhara et al., 1997). Other adaptor protein, SH2-B/rAPS, bind to Grb2 and promotes NGF-dependent activation of Ras and MAP kinases. These proteins interact with the catalytic domain of the TrkA receptor (Qian et al., 1998) and mediate signalling in a variety of neuronal populations. The large number of adaptor proteins that associate with Trk receptors suggest that there are multiple pathways for signal transduction.

# 4. Binding properties of Trk and p75 receptors

Two classes of NGF binding sites exist on the surface of responsive neurons (Sutter et al., 1979). These sites differ 100-fold in equilibrium binding constants, which can be further distinguished by the rates of ligand association and dissociation. The proteins responsible for the high affinity NGF binding site were a subject of considerable debate, since a small percentage of high affinity sites were detected for the TrkA receptor (Jing et al., 1992).

However, both p75 and TrkA receptors have been shown to contribute to the high affinity NGF binding site. Whereas p75 displays fast rates of association and dissociation with NGF, TrkA interacts with much slower on- and off-rates (Mahadeo et al., 1994). Due to its unusually slow on-rate, NGF binding to TrkA results in a relative low affinity \( K_{\mathrm{d}} \) of \( 10^{-9} - 10^{-10} \) M. A similar affinity has been determined for BDNF binding to TrkB receptors (Dechant et al., 1993). These affinities are lower than the high affinity binding site, \( K_{\mathrm{d}} = 10^{-11} \) M, measured in sensory neurons (Dechant et al., 1993; Sutter et al., 1979). When TrkA and p75 receptors are co-expressed, the on-rate is accelerated 25-fold, creating a new kinetic site whose features are consistent with the high affinity NGF binding site (\( K_{\mathrm{d}} = 10^{-11} \) M). This site requires an excess ratio of p75 to TrkA (Chao, 1994). Hence, one function of the p75 receptor is to increase the binding affinity of NGF for TrkA.

It is therefore not correct to refer to p75 and Trk receptors as low and high affinity receptors, since TrkA and TrkB displayed predominantly low affinity values (Hempstead et al., 1991; Dechant et al., 1993) and p75 receptors can exist in a high affinity state (Dechant and Barde, 1997). It is more correct to use the terms high and low affinity to refer to binding sites.

Other receptor systems exhibit similar behavior. At least two functional receptor subunits for IL-2, IL-6, and CNTF are required for high affinity ligand binding, with each subunit independently binding the ligand with a lower affinity. A difference of nearly a 100-fold in the equilibrium binding constants can be contributed by the existence

of a multisubunit receptor system (Nicola and Metcalf, 1992; Mahadeo et al., 1994).

After binding neurotrophins, the ligand-receptor complex is internalized and retrogradely transported in the axon to the cell body (Distefano et al., 1992). Both Trk and p75 receptors play a role in the retrograde transport of neurotrophins. For example, in the isthmo-optic nucleus, BDNF is taken up at the axon terminal and transported to the cell body by both p75 and TrkB receptors (von Bartheld et al., 1995).

Neurotrophin binding to Trk receptors requires the two extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, which may also be necessary for dimerization (Perez et al., 1995; Urfer et al., 1995). The identification of an immunoglobulin-like domain for neurotrophin binding is a recurrent theme for ligand-receptor signalling by receptor tyrosine kinase, such as FGF and c-kit receptors. Besides the IgC2-like domains, the region between the transmembrane and the Ig domain nearest to the membrane may be also critical to binding of neurotrophins (McDonald and Meakin, 1996). The localization of neurotrophin binding sites on their receptors will ultimately lead to the generation of small molecule agonists.

## 5. Interactions between Trk and p75 receptors

The ratio of p75 and Trk receptors dictates responsiveness to individual neurotrophins and their respective equilibrium binding properties (Benedetti et al., 1993; Wyatt and Davies, 1993; Verdi et al., 1994). The properties exhibited by neurotrophins for Trk tyrosine kinase receptors result in different consequences in the presence of p75, or other Trk isoforms.

Direct interactions between p75 and Trk receptors have been difficult to document biochemically. However, immunoprecipitation experiments carried out in crosslinked spinal cord and brain tissues with ${}^{125}$I-NGF suggest that an association between the TrkA and p75 may take place (Huber and Chao, 1995). Photobleaching experiments following a fluorescently tagged p75 receptor have also revealed a potential physical interaction with TrkA receptors (Wolf et al., 1995).

Based upon these previous experiments, it is conceivable that the two receptors exist as part of a complex. The relative low abundance of the receptors found in most cells has made this difficult to assess. To test these possibility, TrkA and p75 receptor cDNAs have been transfected in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-Trk antibodies, followed by immunoblot analysis. After high level expression of the receptors in 293T cells, an association between the two receptors could be easily observed (Fig. 2). The results with p75 and TrkA receptors have also been detected using other cell expression systems and epitope-tagged versions of the receptors (Gargano et al., 1997; Bibel et al., 1999).

and TNF receptors. The death domain is a novel protein–protein association motif found in several pro-apoptotic proteins (Feinstein et al., 1995).

The first report of a cell death activity for p75 was made in immortalized cerebellar neuronal cell lines (Rabizadeh et al., 1993). There are only a few examples in which neurotrophins have been directly shown to be responsible for apoptotic cell death. Many cell types express p75, but do not undergo apoptosis as a result of neurotrophin treatment. This suggests that cell context and history are important determinants and that p75 alone is not sufficient for this activity. The effect of p75 on cell death is highly dependent on the developmental stage of the cells and by their differentiative state in culture (Casacchia-Bonnefil et al., 1998).

Apoptosis mediated by p75 requires specific conditions, with regard to cell type, cell cycle stage, developmental stage, injury or stress. This could be due to time in culture, metabolic impairment, hypoxia, or other types of “stress” signals, such as nerve injury or trauma (Gu et al., 1999). Sensitive cells may be highly susceptible to injury and inflammation and may become more reactive to released growth factors and cytokines by upregulating receptor expression at the site of injury.

An important consequence is that Trk tyrosine kinase receptors can negate the signalling properties of p75, with respect to programmed cell death activities (Yoon et al., 1998). When both NGF receptors are co-expressed, as in the case of PC12 cells, TrkA exerts a suppressive effect upon p75, as assayed by ceramide production (Dobrowsky et al., 1995). Introduction of TrkA receptors into oligodendrocyte susceptible to cell death through p75 activation resulted in a reduction in JNK activation and NGF-induced apoptosis (Yoon et al., 1998). In the absence of TrkA expression, binding of NGF to p75 receptors can increase intracellular ceramide levels through increased sphingomyelin hydrolysis. Therefore, TrkA signalling can selectively down-regulate responses elicited from p75 activation. It should be emphasized that p75 co-expression is ordinarily associated with the ability to enhance NGF binding to TrkA (Hempstead et al., 1991; Barker and Shooter, 1994; Mahadeo et al., 1994).

To address the state of endogenous TrkA and p75 receptors in PC12 cells, co-immunoprecipitation experiments have been carried out in PC12 cells. A subline of PC12 (615) cells that expressed higher levels of TrkA receptors (Hempstead et al., 1992) was employed. The PC12 615 cell line was subjected to NGF treatment for 10

Fig. 3. Association of TrkA receptor with p75 in PC12 cells. TrkA-overexpressing PC12 (615) cells were treated with or without NGF (50 ng/ml, 10 min) and then harvested in TNE buffer. Cell lysates (18 mg of protein) were immunoprecipitated with either anti-pan Trk IgG or normal IgG as a negative control (as described - or - on top of the panel). The resulting immunocomplexes were analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-p75<sup>NTR</sup> antiserum (9992). The immunoprecipitation of TrkA was confirmed by immunoblotting of a portion of the immunocomplex with anti-pan Trk serum and reprobed with anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (pY99, Santa Cruz). The amount of p75 protein in each lysate was analyzed by western blot analysis on the two rightmost lanes of the top panel.

min and lysates were prepared. Interestingly, an association between the two receptors could be detected without NGF treatment. After addition of NGF, a similar interaction between the two receptors could be observed (Fig. 3). These results suggest a preformed complex of neurotrophin receptors exists at the cell membrane. A direct interaction between the two receptors has been difficult to observe. Recent studies indicate that both extracellular and intracellular domains of p75 and Trk receptors may be responsible for the co-immunoprecipitation results (Gargano et al., 1997; Bibel et al., 1999). These observations may be explained by additional cytoplasmic proteins that mediate the association of neurotrophin receptors.

There are several ways to account for an association between receptors. For the Trk receptors, SH2-containing proteins serve as adaptor molecules that link to enzymatic functions. For p75 receptors, signalling intermediates used by TNF and Fas receptors, such as FADD and TRADD proteins, downstream effectors, such as caspase-8 and the FLICE/MACH interacting enzyme (Cleveland and Ihle, 1995) may be functional. It remains to be seen whether p75 utilizes these adaptor proteins, or other interacting proteins of different specificity.

A family of cytokine associated signaling intermediates, the TNF receptor-associated factors (TRAFs), have been described. Originally discovered as molecules associated with the p75 TNF receptor (Rothe et al., 1994), TRAF proteins represent a family of molecules that signal through activation of JNK and NFκB activities. Moreover, these proteins have been found to be associated with receptors required for different biological activities. These receptors include CD30, CD40, and lymphotoxin β (Gedrich et al., 1996; Nakano et al., 1996; Rothe et al., 1995) and the p55 TNF receptor (Hsu et al., 1996).

TRAF6 has been found to bind to p75 receptors and to modulate NFκB responses in Schwann cells (Khursigara et al., 1999). The TRAF6 protein contains several protein–protein binding motifs, such as a RING finger and TRAF domain, that may be instrumental in linking the p75 receptor to other cell surface proteins. Another protein that may be involved in linking Trk receptors with the p75 receptor is caveolin-1 (Bilderback et al., 1999). Caveolin-1 is localized to invaginations in the plasma membrane which are frequently sites where signaling molecules are found. A mutual interaction of caveolin-1 protein with an NGF/p75/TrkA complex may target neurotrophin responses locally in specialized membrane domains.

### Summary

Although ligand-induced dimerization or oligomerization of receptors is a well established mechanism of growth factor signaling, increasing evidence indicates that biological responses are often mediated by receptor trans-signaling mechanisms involving two or more receptor systems. These include G protein-coupled receptors, cytokine,

growth factor and trophic factor receptors. Greater flexibility is provided when different signaling pathways are merged through multiple receptor signaling systems.

Trophic factors exemplified by NGF and its family members, ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) and glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) all utilize increased tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular substrates to mediate neuronal cell survival. Actions of the NGF family of neurotrophins are not only dictated by ras activation through the Trk family of receptor tyrosine kinases, but also a survival pathway defined by phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase activity (Yao and Cooper, 1995), which gives rise to phosphoinositide intermediates that activate the serine/threonine kinase Akt/PKB (Dudek et al., 1997). Induction of the serine-threonine kinase activity is critical for cell survival, as well as cell proliferation. Hence, for many trophic factors, multiple proteins constitute a functional multisubunit receptor complex that activates ras-dependent and ras-independent intracellular signaling.

The NGF receptors provide an example of bidirectional crosstalk. In the presence of TrkA receptors, p75 can participate in the formation of high affinity binding sites and enhanced neurotrophin responsiveness leading to a survival or differentiation signal. In the absence of TrkA receptors, p75 can generate, in only specific cell populations, a death signal. These activities include the induction of NFκB (Carter et al., 1996); the hydrolysis of sphingomyelin to ceramide (Dobrowsky et al., 1995); and the pro-apoptotic functions attributed to p75.

Receptors are generally drawn and viewed as isolated integral membrane proteins which span the lipid bilayer, with signal transduction proceeding in a linear step-wise fashion. There are now numerous examples which indicate that each receptor acts not only in a linear, independent manner, but can also influence the activity of other cell surface receptors, either directly or through signaling intermediates. Which step and which intermediates are utilized for crosstalk between the receptors is a critical question. For neurotrophins, their primary function in sustaining the viability of neurons is counterbalanced by a receptor mechanism to eliminate cells by an apoptotic mechanism. It is conceivable that this bidirectional system may be utilized selectively during development and in neurodegenerative diseases.
