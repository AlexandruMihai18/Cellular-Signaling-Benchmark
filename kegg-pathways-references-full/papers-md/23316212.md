normal bladders of men, and summarized the information in a database.

Small non-coding RNAs are endogenous RNA molecules of about 18–25 nucleotides in length that regulate gene expression in many ways (Kaikkonen et al., 2011). There are several classes of small RNAs like miRNAs, including PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs), small interfering RN
(Figure 1). Using bioinformatic methods, it was predicted that some miRNA molecules aberrantly expressed in BC actually target the FGFR3 gene product. Examples of this include miR-145, miR-101, miR-99a, and miR-100. Furthermore, the regulation of FGFR3 by miR-99a and miR-
