■ Abstract The secretion of fluid and electrolytes by salivary gland acinar cells requires the coordinated regulation of multiple water and ion transporter and channel proteins. Notably, all the key transporter and channel proteins in this process appear to be activated, or are up-regulated, by an increase in the intracellular Ca²⁺ concentration ([Ca²⁺]i). Consequently, salivation occurs in response to agonists that generate an increase in [Ca²⁺]i. The mechanisms that act to modulate these increases in [Ca²⁺]i obviously influence the secretion of salivary fluid. Such modulation may involve effects on mechanisms of both Ca²⁺ release and Ca²⁺ entry and the resulting spatial and temporal aspects of the [Ca²⁺]i signal, as well as interactions with other signaling pathways in the cells. The molecular cloning of many of the transporter and regulatory molecules involved in fluid and electrolyte secretion has yielded a better understanding of this process at the cellular level. The subsequent characterization of mice with null mutations in many of these genes has demonstrated the physiological roles of individual proteins. This review focuses on recent developments in determining the molecular identification of the proteins that regulate the fluid secretion process.  

INTRODUCTION  

Mammals express three major pairs of salivary glands (parotid, submandibular, and sublingual) along with numerous minor glands that are scattered throughout the oral cavity. Glands are composed of two basic cell types, acinar cells, which make up the secretory endpiece, and duct cells, of which there are several varieties (intercalated, striated, etc.). Salivary acinar cells can be either serous or mucous, with the relative distribution of these two cell types in individual glands being species- and gland-specific. The secretion from salivary glands is typically a watery fluid containing electrolytes and a complex mixture of proteins, although

mucous gland secretions are often quite viscous owing to the discharge of large molecular weight mucins. The final composition of saliva varies depending on the origin of the stimulation, i.e., sympathetic versus parasympathetic, and the type of salivary gland. Humans typically secrete more than a liter of saliva each day, the major portion coming from the parotid and submandibular glands. Saliva provides protection and hydration for mucosal structures within the oral cavity, oropharynx, and esophagus. Some of the specialized functions of saliva include the initiation of digestion, antimicrobial defense, and protection from mechanical and chemical insults. Salivation is a highly regulated process, occurring at relatively slow rates between meals, and there is almost none generated during sleep. In contrast, 80–90% of the daily saliva output is produced in response to stimuli such as taste, smell, and masticatory forces during the few hours while eating each day.

The importance of saliva is clearly illustrated in individuals suffering from salivary gland hypofunction. Decreased salivation manifests clinically as oral pain, increased dental caries, and infections by opportunistic microorganisms such as *Candida albicans*. Salivary gland dysfunction is most frequently observed as a consequence of iatrogenic treatments such as medications or irradiation therapy for head and neck cancers, but it is also regularly observed in diseases such as cystic fibrosis, where ductal obstructions are common, or Sjögren’s syndrome, an autoimmune disease in which salivary glands are destroyed by lymphocytic infiltration. For a thorough discussion of the histology, function, and disorders of salivary glands see (1–6).

Similar to the fluid secreted by most exocrine organs, e.g., sweat and lacrimal glands (7, 8), saliva formation involves two stages. Micropuncture and microperfusion studies demonstrated that the primary fluid secreted by salivary acinar cells is a plasma-like, isotonic fluid (stage 1). This NaCl-rich solution is subsequently modified upon passage through the ducts (stage 2). Acinar cells are thought to produce all of the fluid in saliva. As the acinar cell secretion passes through the duct system, NaCl is reabsorbed, while K⁺ and HCO₃⁻ are excreted. The hypotonicity of secreted saliva indicates that ducts are relatively impermeant to water. Indeed, depending on the flow rate and the mode of neurotransmitter stimulation, the osmolarity of saliva can be less than 100 mOsm. Acinar cells are also responsible for the secretion of most of the proteins found in saliva (>85%), although duct cells secrete numerous proteins with important biological activities, e.g., nerve growth factor, epidermal growth factor, immunoglobulin A, and kallikrein.

### FLUID SECRETION MECHANISM

#### Cl⁻-Dependent Fluid and Electrolyte Secretion

The salivary gland fluid secretion model has been previously described in depth in several earlier reviews (see 1, 9–11). Therefore, only a brief overview is provided here, as the following sections focus on reviewing recent advances made in

determining the molecular identities of the involved transporter mechanisms and in understanding the regulation of fluid secretion.

In currently accepted models, the transepithelial movement of Cl⁻ is the primary driving force for fluid and electrolyte secretion by salivary gland acinar cells (a typical salivary acinar cell is shown in Figure 1). The Na⁺ pump, at the expenditure of ATP, extrudes 3 Na⁺ in exchange for 2 extracellular K⁺, producing a 10–15-fold inward-directed Na⁺ chemical gradient. Various transporters use this gradient to elevate intracellular Cl⁻ levels. The major Na⁺-dependent Cl⁻ uptake pathway in salivary glands is an electroneutral Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporter located in the basolateral membrane. Most salivary gland acinar cells also possess a second Cl⁻ uptake pathway, the paired basolateral Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ and Na⁺/H⁺ exchangers. Together, these Na⁺-dependent Cl⁻ uptake mechanisms concentrate intracellular Cl⁻ greater than five times above its electrochemical gradient (12, 13), a requirement for Cl⁻ exit via Cl⁻ channels. Agonist-stimulated secretion is initiated by the opening of K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels located in the basolateral and apical membranes, respectively. Cl⁻ channels provide the pathway for Cl⁻ efflux into the acinar lumen. Activation of the K⁺ channels is necessary to maintain the electrochemical driving force for Cl⁻ efflux. As predicted from the secretion model, activation of these channels produces a rapid loss of both intracellular K⁺ and Cl⁻ (12–15). A transepithelial potential difference is created as Cl⁻ crosses the acinar apical membrane and K⁺ enters the interstitial fluid. This lumen-negative, electrical potential difference leads to the passive movement of cations across the tight junctions of acinar cells. Luminal accumulation of ions generates a transepithelial osmotic gradient that drives the movement of water. This process results in the creation of a plasma-like primary secretion, the ionic composition of which reflects the Na⁺, Cl⁻, and K⁺ concentrations of the interstitial fluid bathing the basolateral aspect of the acinar cells. Water movement appears to be mediated by paracellular pathways and transcellular transport via water channels.

## HCO₃⁻-Dependent Fluid and Electrolyte Secretion

Cl⁻ uptake via Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporters provides the major driving force for generating fluid secretion. However, it has been known for some time that significant saliva is produced when this bumetanide-sensitive Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporter is inhibited or absent (~30% of the control rate) (16–18). The residual bumetanide-resistant secretion is HCO₃⁻ dependent and apparently involves multiple mechanisms (Figure 2). As described above, the basolateral membranes of most, but not all (19, 20), salivary acinar cells express paired Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ and Na⁺/H⁺ exchanger activities. NaCl uptake in exchange for intracellular HCO₃⁻ and H⁺ mediated by these functionally coupled exchangers provides machinery to drive Cl⁻-dependent secretion in parallel to the cotransporter. The contribution of the Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchange mechanism to Cl⁻ movement requires intracellular HCO₃⁻. Intracellular carbonic anhydrases generate HCO₃⁻ by catalyzing the reversible reaction of water and CO₂ to form HCO₃⁻ and H⁺. The protons produced during this process

are expelled via Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers. Numerous observations are in agreement with this model: Salivary glands express carbonic anhydrases (21, 22); carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce secretion (16, 23); exchanger activity is dramatically up-regulated during stimulated secretion (24–26); whereas exchanger antagonists inhibit secretion (16, 18, 23).

Similar to Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux, HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> efflux directly drives fluid secretion. Cl<sup>-</sup> channels display relatively little discrimination among anions. This nonselectivity and the fact that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> is an abundant intracellular anion (second only to Cl<sup>-</sup>) indicate that an electrogenic HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> conductance significantly contributes to fluid secretion. Consistent with channel-mediated HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> efflux, agonists that generate an increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> induce an acidification in acinar cells that is inhibited by either HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> depletion or Cl<sup>-</sup> channel blockers (25, 27). Several recent studies have detected Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporter activity in acinar cells as well. Expression of these Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporters appears to be both gland- and species-specific; these observations suggest a potential role for Na<sup>+</sup>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> cotransporters in salivary secretion and/or intracellular pH regulation in at least some salivary glands (28–30).

Furthermore, the intracellular CO<sub>2</sub>/HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> buffering system is important for regulating secretion by maintaining a neutral intracellular pH. The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel in parotid acinar cells is inhibited by even slightly acidic intracellular pH levels (31). Because of the critical role for this Cl<sup>-</sup> pathway, this dependence makes the salivary flow rate similarly sensitive to intracellular pH. In addition, although it has not been directly investigated in salivary tissues, the relevant Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent K<sup>+</sup> channels are also likely inhibited by low internal pH (32, 33). During muscarinic receptor activation, the intracellular pH of acinar cells initially decreases through HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> efflux (0.2–0.4 unit) via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel (25). Consequently, excessive HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> (as well as Cl<sup>-</sup>) efflux via the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>-</sup> channel is prevented, and thus the resulting intracellular pH drop is limited to protect cell homeostasis. Importantly, the agonist-induced increase in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] also stimulates Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchangers (24), the increased activity of which reverses the initial acidification and ultimately raises the intracellular pH of acinar cells 0.1–0.3 unit higher than the unstimulated pH. Because the activity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> channels increases as the intracellular pH rises, fluid secretion continues even as the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration decreases toward the resting level. Thus it is likely that the pH sensitivity of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> channels is important in sustaining fluid secretion during prolonged stimulation.

## Molecular Identities of Ion and Water Transport Mechanisms in Acinar Cells

Through a combination of molecular, functional, and genetic studies, the identities of many of the key ion, water, and signaling molecules have been confirmed (Table 1). As described above, the primary Cl<sup>-</sup> uptake pathway is the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>/2Cl<sup>-</sup>

mediate Cl$^{-}$ uptake (38, 39). Members of two distinct gene families encode for anion exchangers (SLC4A and SLC26A) (40, 41). Molecular and functional data currently suggest that the AE2 (or SLC4A2) isoform is most likely responsible for the basolateral anion exchanger activity in acinar cells (26, 35). AE2 is one of four genes that encodes for anion exchangers within the SLC4A family (AE1-3 or SLC4A1-3, and AE4 or SLC4A9). AE4 is also expressed in salivary glands but expression appears to be restricted to the basolateral membranes of duct cells in rat and mouse (42). The other members of this gene family are apparently Na$^{+}$/HCO$_{3}^{-}$ cotransporters.

Immunohistochemical localization studies have detected several of these different Na$^{+}$/HCO$_{3}^{-}$ cotransporters in salivary gland acinar and/or duct cells, both in the apical and basolateral membranes (29, 30, 43, 44). Functional studies detect Na$^{+}$/HCO$_{3}^{-}$ cotransporter activity in acinar cells (28–30), but it remains unclear what function such transporters might play in this cell type. HCO$_{3}^{-}$ uptake via Na$^{+}$/HCO$_{3}^{-}$ cotransporters might provide transport substrate for the apical anion channel as well as the basolateral Cl$^{-}$/HCO$_{3}^{-}$ exchanger, and thus, in both cases, increase the driving force for fluid secretion. As for the SLC26A gene family, no members have been described in salivary cells; however, the large number of isoforms (41) and the ubiquitous expression pattern of several of these exchangers suggest that one or more members may be involved in salivary gland function.

Na$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ exchangers make up a gene family with eight known members (NHE1-8 or SLC9A1-8). NHE1-5 and NHE8 (SLC9A1-5 and SLC9A8) are targeted to the plasma membrane (45, 46), whereas NHE6 and NHE7 (SLC9A6-7) are intracellular Na$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ exchangers (47, 48). Like the housekeeping Na$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ exchanger NHE1, the intracellular Na$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ exchangers are widely expressed, whereas the distribution patterns of NHE2-NHE5 are much more restricted. Salivary glands likely express all these Na$^{+}$/H$^{+}$ exchangers with the exception of NHE5, where high-level expression is restricted to the brain. NHE1 is expressed in the basolateral membranes of both acinar and duct cells (very high expression in duct relative to acinar cells: see 35, 49–51). In contrast, NHE2 is targeted to the apical membranes of both acinar and duct cell in some glands, whereas NHE3 is found only in the apical membranes of duct cells (49–51). A NHE4 message was detected in both acinar and duct cells, but the functional significance of this observation is yet to be determined (50). Functional analysis of *Nhe1*, *Nhe2*, and *Nhe3* knockout mice indicates that NHE1 is the primary regulator of intracellular pH in acinar cells (24, 25) and, as such, is likely to be important for salivation. Indeed, *Nhe1$^{-/-}$* mice secreted 30–40% less saliva in vivo than did wild-type littermates (51).

There are at least 10 aquaporin, or water channel, genes (*Aqp0-Aqp9*). Of these, 5 are expressed in salivary glands including *Aqp1*, *Aqp3*, *Aqp4*, *Aqp5*, and *Aqp8*. *Aqp5* was originally cloned from salivary glands (52) and is highly expressed in the apical membranes of salivary acinar cells (53–55). *Aqp1* is expressed in the endothelial cells of salivary glands (35), whereas *Aqp3* is found in the basolateral membrane of acinar and duct cells of some salivary glands (56). *Aqp4* was detected in the basolateral membrane of duct cells (57), although not all studies have
observed this expression pattern (56). Aqp8 is strongly expressed in myoepithelial cells (58). Of these water channels, AQP5 appears to be the only aquaporin to play a major role in salivation. A null mutation in the Aqp5 gene dramatically inhibited in vivo saliva production by about 60% (55, 59). Consistent with these observations, mice lacking Aqp5 also displayed decreased acinar cell water permeability of a magnitude comparable to the loss of secretion (59). In contrast, disruption of the Aqp1, Aqp3, or Aqp4 genes had no significant effects on secretion (55, 60). It is not clear whether AQP5 is associated with some forms of salivary gland dysfunction. Subjects with Sjögren's syndrome suffer from a severe deficit in fluid production by salivary glands and other exocrine organs. It was found in salivary acinar cells from individuals with Sjögren's syndrome that AQP5 targets to the basolateral membrane, but it distributes to the apical membrane in patients with other salivary gland hypofunction disorders, as well as in control subjects (61). These observations suggest that correct AQP5 targeting may be sensitive to the disease state of the gland and that its localization may be critical to its function in salivation. It has been conjectured that in addition to its water channel function, AQP5 acts as an osmosensor that provides a signal to regulate the tonicity of saliva and the permeability of acinar cell tight junctions (62). This interesting model might explain the increased tonicity of the saliva produced by AQP5-deficient mice (55); however, there is currently no direct evidence to support this hypothesis.

At least five types of Cl⁻ channels have been identified in the plasma membrane of salivary gland acinar cells. This classification scheme is based on the electrophysiological fingerprints of each current, including, e.g., gating mechanism, activation kinetics, and pharmacology. The activation properties for each of these Cl⁻ channels are unique, such that they can be functionally isolated during patch-clamp recordings. Channels that are dependent for activation on an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺, an increase in intracellular cAMP, exposure to extracellular ATP, hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane, or cell swelling have been described (63–65). As discussed below, functional studies indicate that the Ca²⁺-gated Cl⁻ channel is the major apical Cl⁻ efflux pathway. Activation of the Ca²⁺-dependent Cl⁻ channel is both time and voltage dependent, and the current-voltage relation is strongly outwardly rectifying (66). The molecular identity of the acinar Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ current has not been determined, although members of three gene families have been implicated as Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels, i.e., CLCN3, CLCA, and Bestrophin. Human CLCN3 was cloned from the T84 colon tumor cell line and, when expressed in the mammalian epithelial cell line tsA, produces CaMKII-dependent Cl⁻ currents (67). However, these currents look quite different from the native CaMKII-dependent Cl⁻ currents in T84 cells (68). Expressed CLCN3 currents displayed nearly linear current-voltage relations and no time dependence; furthermore, they did not require Ca²⁺, as chelation with BAPTA did not inhibit the currents activated by the catalytic subunit of CaMKII (67). Unlike these currents and those in T84 cells, the Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ currents in rat salivary acinar cells are insensitive to CaMKII inhibitors (68). Moreover, it has been unequivocally demonstrated that Clcn3 is not the Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻

channel, at least in mouse parotid acinar cells, because knockout of the *Clcn3* gene had no effect on either muscarinic-induced fluid secretion or on the magnitude or activation kinetics of the Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ currents (69).

The first member of another putative Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channel gene family, bCLCA1, was cloned from cow (70). At least four different members (*CLCA1-4*) have subsequently been identified (71). Because of the high sequence homology within this gene family, it has been difficult to precisely determine the tissue expression patterns of the various CLCA isoforms. With this caveat in mind, it appears that mCLCA1 is highly expressed in secretory organs including salivary glands (C. Ovitt & J.E. Melvin, unpublished observation). However, controversy remains as to the functions of the members of this gene family. It is clear that expression of these genes leads to Ca²⁺-modulated Cl⁻ currents (72), but the currents do not recapitulate the functional properties of the native currents in the tissues from which these channels were cloned. Interestingly, other reports suggest that CLCAs act as tumor suppressor and/or signaling molecules (73). More recently, an additional Ca²⁺-gated Cl⁻ channel gene family has been identified, the so-called Bestrophins, of which there are currently four identified members, *BEST1–BEST4*. Mutations in *BEST1* result in Best’s disease, an autosomal-recessive progressive form of vitelliform macular dystrophy (74). It is not known whether members of this gene family are expressed in salivary glands. Expression of mBest2 generates Ca²⁺-gated Cl⁻ currents that are sensitive to physiological intracellular Ca²⁺ concentrations (*Kd* = 230 nM) (75). However, unlike acinar cell Ca²⁺-gated Cl⁻ currents, heterologously expressed mBest2 currents are neither voltage nor time dependent, and the current-voltage relation is linear. It is tempting to speculate that either a CLCA or a Bestrophin is an integral part of the Ca²⁺-gated Cl⁻ channel in salivary acinar cells. However, the failure of heterologous expression systems to produce currents like those in native acinar cells raises concern. If a CLCA or a Bestrophin is the Ca²⁺-gated Cl⁻ channel in acinar cells, these results suggest that an auxiliary subunit is required to faithfully recapitulate native currents.

At least four other types of Cl⁻ channels are also expressed in salivary acinar cells, but the functional roles of these channels remain unknown. These channels include those activated by exposure to extracellular ATP, by cell swelling, by an increase in intracellular cAMP, or through hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane. Molecular identification of the two latter channels has been recently made. *CFTR* and *CLCN2* encode for the cAMP-dependent (64) and the hyperpolarization-activated (76) Cl⁻ channels, respectively. Mutations in functional domains of the *CFTR* gene result in cystic fibrosis, but this disease apparently has little or no effect on the salivary flow rate. However, there are reports of increased blockage of mucin-secreting salivary glands, suggesting that there may be changes in the properties and/or composition of the saliva in affected glands. Targeted disruption of the *Clcn2* gene led to degeneration of the retina and testis, but the loss of this hyperpolarization-activated channel in acinar cells did not affect secretion (76). The identities of the cell swelling-dependent and ATP-activated Cl⁻ channels remain unclear. Considerable evidence suggests that the cell swelling-dependent

current found in most mammalian cells is produced by CLCN3 (77, 78). However, null mutations of the *Clcn3* gene did not eliminate these currents in hepatocytes and pancreatic acinar cells (79), nor in salivary acinar cells (69).

Fluid secretion depends critically on the movement of Cl⁻ (and HCO₃⁻) ions through Ca²⁺-activated channels in the luminal membrane. Activation of Cl⁻ channels alone would cause the membrane potential to approach the Nernst potential for these ions and so fluid secretion would cease. Thus other channels must be present to maintain a driving force for Cl⁻ and fluid secretion. Several types of cation channels have been observed in various types of salivary glands from different animals (reviewed in 1) but the most common is a Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channel of the maxi-K class (125–250 pS conductance). Channels of this type are expressed in mouse (80) and human (81, 82) parotid acinar cells. The biophysical footprint and pharmacological profile of this channel suggest that it is encoded by the *KCNMA1* (*SLO*) gene (83). Molecular biological evidence in mice points to a parotid-specific splice variant that is highly homologous to human SLO1 (83). The channels in mouse parotid acinar cells appear to be a mix of equal parts homomeric channels with the Slo α subunit and heteromeric channels of Slo and the β4 subunit (83).

Cation channels with a lower conductance are often observed in salivary glands—at least some of which do not discriminate among monovalent cations. However, mouse parotid acinar cells robustly express an intermediate (22 pS) conductance, Ca²⁺-activated K⁺-selective channel (83). These channels are encoded by the *KCNN4* gene (previously denoted as *IK1* or *SK4*).

## REGULATION OF FLUID SECRETION

Both calcium-mobilizing and cAMP-generating signaling pathways have been linked to salivation. An increase in the intracellular [Ca²⁺] is the primary fluid secretion signal in salivary acinar cells. In contrast, cAMP signals regulate secretory granule discharge but produce little fluid on their own. Multiple types of receptors linked to Ca²⁺ mobilization are expressed on acinar cells, including muscarinic, α-adrenergic, substance P, and P2y and P2x nucleotide receptor subtypes. It appears, however, that the m3 muscarinic subtype is the key receptor associated with fluid secretion. Knockout of the m1, m2, m4, or m5 muscarinic receptors had little, if any, effect on muscarinic agonist-induced secretion (84). In contrast, disruption of the m3 muscarinic receptor dramatically inhibited secretion (84, 85). The modest effects of knocking out the m1, m4, and m5 muscarinic receptors on fluid secretion potentially suggest nonspecific effects, possibly owing to changes in the response of the vasculature in the salivary glands to stimulation. The cAMP-stimulated discharge of secretory granules by acinar cells is primarily associated with the activation of β-adrenergic receptors; however, other receptors are also coupled to adenyl cyclase activity through the G protein Gs, e.g., VIP (vasoactive intestinal polypeptide) receptors.

Ca²⁺-Dependent Fluid Secretion

The initial response to muscarinic receptor activation is primarily the release of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores as discussed below. Fluid secretion proceeds as the rise in [Ca²⁺]i activates Ca²⁺-gated K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels located in the basolateral and apical membranes of acinar cells, respectively. Prolonged salivation, as occurs during the ingestion of a meal, depends on the [Ca²⁺]i being maintained by extracellular Ca²⁺ influx. This interpretation of the Ca²⁺ kinetics and dependency of the fluid secretion process arose from several observations. First, removal of external Ca²⁺ rapidly inhibits secretion, and the kinetics of the inhibition mimics the decrease in [Ca²⁺]i detected during this maneuver (14). Moreover, the efflux of KCl is mediated by the activation of Ca²⁺-gated K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels; thus, as predicted from this model, chelation of the rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ prevents KCl efflux (14, 86). Additionally, salivary acinar cells typically react to muscarinic stimulation by a global Ca²⁺ response that results in significant Ca²⁺ loss via plasma membrane Ca²⁺ pumps, thus the need to compensate for the efflux of intracellular Ca²⁺ (see below).

In addition to the Ca²⁺-gated K⁺ and Cl⁻ channels, the intracellular Ca²⁺ increase during muscarinic stimulation appears to activate other key water and ion transporter proteins. An increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ reportedly up-regulates Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporter activity ~20-fold relative to the basal flux rate (87). The mechanism for this increased activity is somehow associated with arachidonic acid metabolism, likely a product of the cytochrome P450 pathway of arachidonic acid metabolism. The increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ also appears to up-regulate the Na⁺/H⁺ and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchangers (26, 88). Therefore, the Ca²⁺-induced stimulation of Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporter activity, as well as the Na⁺/H⁺ and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchangers, assures that the intracellular Cl⁻ concentration remains above its electrochemical gradient. Furthermore, a muscarinic-stimulated rise in [Ca²⁺]i acutely regulates the insertion of AQP5 water channels into the plasma membrane (89). This response is short-lived, i.e., the plasma membrane-associated AQP5 content returns to basal levels in ~5 min (90), suggesting that there is short-term increase in the transcellular water permeability. It is interesting to note that this phenomenon correlates with the enhanced secretion rate typically seen during the early stages of secretion (17, 51).

## Calcium Mobilization

Acetylcholine (ACh) is the primary neurotransmitter associated with the robust fluid secretion activated during parasympathetic stimulation. Muscarinic receptors, primarily of the m3 subtype (91), are activated on the basolateral surface of acinar cells following neural release of acetylcholine. M3 receptors are coupled to G proteins (Gq and Gi), which subsequently activate phospholipase Cβ (PLCβ). PLCβ cleaves phosphatidylinositol 1,4, bisphosphate (PIP₂) to produce diacylglycerol (DAG) and the soluble signaling molecule inositol 1,4,5, trisphosphate (InsP₃). This elevation of InsP₃ is the key event in initiating an increase in [Ca²⁺]i, as InsP₃ binds to and subsequently activates a cation-selective ion channel, termed
the InsP₃ receptor (InsP₃R), which is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (92). InsP₃ receptors are encoded by three genes, resulting in three distinct proteins, the type-1 InsP₃R (InsP₃R-1), type-2 (InsP₃R-2), and type-3 (InsP₃R-3) (93). Differences in the affinity for InsP₃ of the InsP₃R types and their regulation of activity is considered a major determinant in defining the characteristics of intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling in a particular cell type (94). Several studies indicate that all three forms of InsP₃R are expressed in both acinar and ductal tissue isolated from submandibular and parotid glands (95–98). At least in rat parotid acinar tissue, InsP₃R-2 appears to be the most abundant family member expressed, accounting for approximately 90% of the complement of receptors (97). Substantial expression of InsP₃R-3 was also detected in this study with a minor ~1% contribution from InsP₃R-1 (97). In common with acinar cells from other exocrine tissue, such as the pancreas, the vast majority of all InsP₃R types is expressed immediately below the apical plasma membrane of the cell in an area bounded by the actin cytoskeleton “terminal-web” (98, 99). The localization of InsP₃R, similar to that of pancreatic acinar cells, appears to explain the initiation of Ca²⁺ signaling in the apical region of the cell (96, 98, 100, 101). However, in contrast to pancreatic acinar cells, which are capable of exhibiting localized apical Ca²⁺ signals (101), salivary acinar cells typically react to muscarinic stimulation by displaying rapid global Ca²⁺ signals (96), as shown in Figure 3. The differing kinetics of Ca²⁺ signals described in parotid versus pancreatic acinar cells may in some part be explained by the observation that parotid acinar cells express approximately fourfold higher density of InsP₃R than pancreatic acinar cells (6). In addition, it appears that a major contribution to the apical restriction of Ca²⁺ signals in pancreatic acinar cells is accomplished by the localization of peri-granular mitochondria (102, 103), which, by taking up Ca²⁺, serve as a “fire wall” to prevent regenerative Ca²⁺ signals from propagating into the basal region of the cell. In contrast, peri-granular mitochondria are absent in parotid acinar cells (104). Instead the predominant localization of mitochondria in parotid tissue is to a region surrounding the nucleus.

The expression of ryanodine receptors (RyR) in salivary acinar cells has also been suggested both functionally (97, 98, 105–107) and physically (97, 98, 105). RyR are intracellular Ca²⁺ release channels that belong to a family related to InsP₃R. RyR receptors are gated by elevations in cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ in a process termed calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) and contribute to the mechanisms underpinning regenerative Ca²⁺ waves in a variety of cells (94). PCR performed on rat parotid acinar samples indicates that RyR-1, the skeletal isoform of the protein, is the major isoform expressed. Although the precise role of RyR in the genesis of Ca²⁺ signals in salivary acinar cells is far from well understood, their localization predominantly to the basal pole of the cell (97) suggests that they play a role in the globalization of the Ca²⁺ signal. It is tempting to speculate that whereas the invariably global Ca²⁺ signals in salivary acinar cells are necessary for activating spatially separated ionic conductances, the relative paucity of fluid secretion by pancreatic acinar cells reflects the apically localized nature of the Ca²⁺ signals in this cell type.The clearance of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the cytoplasm following the removal of the secretagogue is accomplished by the activity of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPases localized to both the ER (SERCA-type pump) and plasma membrane (PMCA-type pump) (108, 109). Interestingly, specific isoforms of each of these pumps have been reported to be selectively localized to the apical region of salivary acinar cells (109). The specific localization of these pumps likely contributes to establishing microdomains of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ in the neighborhood of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-activated ionic conductances. Indeed, local clearance of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by SERCA pumps has been shown to contribute substantially to the deactivation of chloride currents in parotid acinar cells (96).

## Calcium Entry

As noted above, a sustained secretion of salivary fluid requires the influx of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from the extracellular medium. Despite this importance, and in marked contrast to the InsP$_3$-induced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release discussed above, the nature and regulation of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry pathways involved in maintaining fluid secretion remain far from clear. In nonexcitable cells in general, such entry would typically involve small-conductance channels activated by agonists acting at receptors coupled to the activation of phospholipase C (PLC). The most thoroughly studied mode of such agonist-activated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry is capacitative or store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry, which is activated following the emptying of agonist-sensitive intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores (110, 111). The channels responsible for this entry are generically described as store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ channels (SOC channels), and it is clear that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entering via these channels plays a key role in determining the amplitude of the sustained elevated cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signals seen at high agonist concentrations, as well as in refilling of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ stores on termination of the signal. With respect to salivary gland acinar cells, such store-operated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry has been fairly extensively described. Indeed, many of the studies establishing and defining this particular mode of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry were originally performed on these cells (110, 112). However, these studies have almost exclusively relied on fluorescence measurements of changes in cytosolic $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (or a surrogate such as $\mathrm{Mn}^{2+}$ or $\mathrm{Ba}^{2+}$). This technique has several potential pitfalls as it is not always easy to dissect effects on the entry pathway itself from effects on other components of the overall $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ regulatory system of the cell, such as SERCA and plasma membrane $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ pumps, mitochondria, membrane potential, etc. Perhaps more importantly, although firmly establishing the presence of a store-operated mode of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ entry in salivary gland cells, such studies are less informative regarding the specific nature of the conductances involved. This can be definitively done only when the activity of the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-permeable conductances are measured directly, which typically requires application of patch-clamp techniques. To date, direct measurement of SOC channel activity using such techniques has been performed on only the HSG salivary gland cell line (113). In these cells, the SOC channels display a rather poor selectivity for $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (114) and, therefore, differ from store-operated currents seen in many other nonexcitable cells including the so-called CRAC channels—the extensively studied, archetypal, highlyCa²⁺-selective store-operated channels (115, 116). Potentially, this could be important because the predominant effect of any nonselective cation conductance would be to depolarize the cell, which would tend to reduce Ca²⁺ influx rather than increase it. Whether the same properties are shown by the endogenous SOC channels in native salivary acinar cells remains to be determined.

As to the molecular identity of this conductance, evidence suggests that TRPC1, a member of the TRPC family of proteins originally cloned on the basis of the *trp* mutant in *Drosophila*, may form at least part of this channel. TRPC1 is endogenously present in rat submandibular gland cells, and adenovirus-mediated overexpression of human TRPC1 in this gland resulted in increases in the sustained elevated \[Ca²⁺\]i signal following treatment with either the SERCA pump inhibitor, thapsigargin, or carbachol (100 μM) (117). Importantly, this overexpression of TRPC1 also resulted in a markedly enhanced pilocarpine-stimulated salivary secretion flow. Again, studies in the HSG cell line have generated more detailed information, but it remains to be seen how far this applies to the endogenous SOC channels of acinar cells.

Regulation of the activity of the store-operated channels in salivary gland cells, as in other cell types, is only poorly understood. Reports have implicated a mechanism involving nitric oxide and/or cGMP. Data from submandibular acinar cells suggest that a Ca²⁺-sensitive NOS is activated by the release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores, leading to increases in nitric oxide. This results in elevated cGMP levels that act as the activator of store-operated Ca²⁺ entry (118). In contrast, data from mouse parotid acinar cells suggest that nitric oxide itself increases store-operated Ca²⁺ entry in an indirect, and cGMP-independent fashion by enhancing the release of Ca²⁺ from internal stores (119). Intriguingly, the same group subsequently described a nitric oxide-dependent inhibition of store-operated Ca²⁺ entry in the same cells and have argued that the positive versus negative effects of nitric oxide on store-operated entry may depend on its concentration.

However, an important caveat to all the studies described above is that they all involved the activation of Ca²⁺ entry by processes expected to maximally deplete intracellular stores. Whereas this will obviously provide a powerful signal for the activation of SOC channels, contributions from other Ca²⁺ permeable conductances activated by more subtle stimulation would not be observed under these conditions (120). In this context, recent evidence from a variety of different cell types has shown that at lower, presumably more physiologically relevant, agonist concentrations the influx of Ca²⁺ occurs via a distinct pathway involving a novel arachidonic acid-activated, highly Ca²⁺-selective channel (ARC channel) (121, 122). Entry via these channels influences the unique spatial and temporal characteristics of the Ca²⁺ signals seen at these lower agonist concentrations (123). Given that these signals are widely considered to be critical for the regulation of a majority of cellular responses, including fluid secretion, the activity and regulation of these ARC channels would seem to be particularly important. Recently, it has been shown that conductances showing all the critical characteristics of ARC channels are present in both mouse and human parotid acinar cells (122). Consistent with
this, addition of low concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid (4–8 μM) to mouse parotid acinar cells induces an enhanced entry of Ca²⁺ that is independent of the release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores (i.e., noncapacitative). It should be noted that Watson et al. (124) have described an arachidonic acid-dependent Ca²⁺ entry pathway in mouse parotid acinar cells that is clearly different from that involving the ARC channels. The pathway they describe apparently results from a depletion of ryanodine-sensitive stores and is dependent on the generation of nitric oxide. However, the very high concentrations of exogenous arachidonic acid used in their study (45 μM) are known to induce a variety of nonspecific effects on membrane fluidity and integrity, making interpretation of these data problematic. As for Ca²⁺ entry via the ARC channels, recent evidence indicates that it plays a key specific role in the control of Ca²⁺ signals activated at low agonist concentrations, whereas store-operated entry predominates at high concentrations (O. Mignen & T. Shuttleworth, manuscript in preparation). This would appear to be consistent with the phenomenon of reciprocal-regulation of these two coexisting conductances described in other cell types (120). Given the critical role of Ca²⁺ entry in the generation of a sustained secretory response from the parotid, the precise characterization of these conductances and their respective contribution, relative to the coexisting SOC channels, to overall Ca²⁺ entry under various conditions of stimulation will be critical to understanding the control of secretory activity in the gland.

## Cross-Talk Between Signaling Pathways

Although the activation of Ca²⁺-dependent ion channels is the primary mechanism underlying fluid secretion from the parotid gland (125), secretion can be significantly enhanced when both Ca²⁺ and cAMP signaling systems are activated concurrently (126, 127). Despite extensive studies demonstrating that the elevation of [Ca²⁺]i is critically important for initiating fluid secretion, a considerable body of evidence indicates that this is not the complete story for the overall control of secretion in salivary glands. Several in vivo studies have indicated a key role in the primary neural control of salivary fluid secretion for various neuropeptides such as vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), as well as β-adrenergic agonists, whose actions are predominantly mediated by an elevation in intracellular cAMP (128–131). Interestingly, evidence indicates that these agents have little or no effect on fluid secretion by themselves but have potent synergistic effects on the fluid secretion induced by submaximal stimulation with ACh (126, 127). VIP also markedly increases blood flow to the glands (127), but there is clear evidence for effects on fluid secretion that are independent of any vasomotor actions.

The generality of this response has been demonstrated by numerous reports in a variety of animal models including rodents, ferrets, and cats. These studies show essentially the same potentiating effects on parotid fluid secretion induced by Ca²⁺-mobilizing agonists, such as substance P or ACh, or by other agents that

raise cAMP, including VIP, CGRP, and isoproterenol, or by forskolin (to directly activate adenylyl cyclase) (126–132). Despite this considerable body of evidence from in vivo studies indicating this marked potentiation of \([Ca^{2+}]_i\)-induced fluid secretion by agents that elevate cAMP, and the demonstration of its critical role in the maximal stimulation of fluid secretion by the salivary glands, the cellular basis for this effect remains largely unknown.

Conceptually, enhanced fluid secretion resulting from the interplay between the \(Ca^{2+}\) and cAMP signaling systems could occur at multiple levels. Although augmented fluid secretion must ultimately occur by the increased transcellular flux of ions, it potentially could occur at the level of generation of the \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) signal because the key ionic conductances are \(Ca^{2+}\) dependent; alternatively, it could occur by directly influencing the activity of the ion channels themselves. Whereas some evidence does exist for the direct modulation of ion channels, there is strong support in the literature for the idea that raising cAMP can modulate the generation of the \(Ca^{2+}\) signal per se. For example, isoproterenol treatment of rat parotid acinar cells at concentrations that alone do not elicit \(Ca^{2+}\) changes significantly potentiates \(Ca^{2+}\) signals stimulated by muscarinic agonists (133). Similarly, direct activation of adenylyl cyclase by forskolin, or direct activation of protein kinase A (PKA) using cell permeable analogs of cAMP, markedly enhances \(Ca^{2+}\) signals through PLCβ-coupled agonists (106). Specifically, the initial increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) is enhanced, subthreshold stimulation is transformed to a measurable \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) increase, and an oscillatory increase can be converted to a sustained \([Ca^{2+}]_i\) increase, all consistent with PKA-activation resulting in a left shift in sensitivity to stimulation by \(Ca^{2+}\)-mobilizing agonists (106). The signal transduction machinery activated by muscarinic agonists is a rich source of potential sites for modulation by PKA. Indeed, in other cell systems, PKA has been shown to regulate InsP₃ levels, InsP₃R sensitivity, RyR sensitivity, \(Ca^{2+}\) influx, and \(Ca^{2+}\) clearance (for review see 134). Although cAMP has been reported to enhance InsP₃ levels in submandibular acinar cells (135), no measurable effect of cAMP on InsP₃ levels could be measured in two independent studies in parotid acinar cells (106, 133). Similarly, no effect on \(Ca^{2+}\) influx or SERCA pump activity was observed upon activating PKA (108). Consistent with the marked enhancement of the initial rise of the \(Ca^{2+}\) signal, the major effect appears to be enhanced InsP₃-induced \(Ca^{2+}\) release as a result of phosphorylation of InsP₃R (106). Moreover, this effect was attributed to the InsP₃R-2 in particular, because this isoform has the greatest sensitivity to InsP₃, is the most abundant in mouse parotid, and was shown to be specifically phosphorylated (106). Although reports in other exocrine tissues suggest that phosphorylation of InsP₃R-3 results in attenuated \(Ca^{2+}\) release, potentiated \(Ca^{2+}\) release through the small population of type-I InsP₃R (InsP₃R-I) could also contribute to this observation.

Whereas in mouse parotid acinar cells no evidence for the participation of RyR in the potentiation of \(Ca^{2+}\) release has been reported, several studies performed in permeabilized rat parotid acinar cells or microsomal vesicles have reported cAMP-induced \(Ca^{2+}\) release, without elevation of InsP₃. This appears to occur through a mechanism requiring RyR (105). However, the physiological relevance

of these observations is not clear because cAMP application resulted in a relatively small release of Ca²⁺ compared with that of InsP₃, and this release occurred under conditions where Ca²⁺ was markedly elevated above baseline levels, and thus presumably RyR would already be activated. It should also be noted that several studies in intact cells have reported no effect of cAMP on [Ca²⁺]i in the absence of stimulation with agonists, and thus it seems likely that the major effect of raising cAMP on Ca²⁺ signaling events occurs at the level of sensitization of the InsP₃R.

In addition to the above effects of cAMP on Ca²⁺ mobilization, potential interactions between Ca²⁺ entry and the cAMP system have been described. However, to date these have focused primarily on the influence of Ca²⁺ entry on cAMP levels. It has been demonstrated that the store-operated entry of Ca²⁺ in mouse parotid acinar cells can increase intracellular cAMP levels, apparently by activating a Ca²⁺-sensitive type 8 adenyl cyclase (136). This effect is also seen in a variety of other cell types, where it has been shown to reflect a close spatial association of the adenyl cyclase with the mouth of the SOC channel pore (137). Significantly, this appears to be a response that is specific to Ca²⁺ entering via the store-operated pathway, because in HEK293 cells it has been shown that entry via the coexisting ARC channels fails to affect adenyl cyclase activity (138). It will be interesting to determine whether the same applies to parotid cells. More importantly, although Ca²⁺ entry can influence cAMP levels, it is not known whether cAMP (or PKA) has any effect on the entry.

## FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Although considerable progress has been made over the past decade in determining the function of the transporter and regulatory molecules involved in salivary gland fluid and electrolyte secretion, we are still some way from a complete understanding. For example, the IK1 and Slo Ca²⁺-activated K⁺ channels will certainly provide the needed driving force for Cl⁻ (and subsequent fluid) secretion, but why are there two types of channels when only one would appear to be needed? Perhaps redundancy is worth the cost in order to protect an important physiological activity. Or is it possible that there is a specific role for each of these channels? Cook & Young (139) showed that fluid secretion could, in principle, be increased if some of the basolateral cell K⁺ conductance were distributed in the luminal membrane. In order to address this issue, it would be useful to determine the special localization of these two types of K⁺ channels—perhaps a difficult task considering the low number of expressed Slo channels (see Reference 1). Single-channel patch-clamp studies almost certainly sample the basolateral membrane and show activity of both channel types. Direct patching of the luminal membrane has not been reported, but it has been suggested that zymogen granules in pancreas acini contain K⁺ channels, and these may become part of the luminal membrane during secretion (140).

The large number of Cl⁻ channels, in salivary acinar cells raises similar questions. Are the functions of these channels overlapping or are they distinct?

Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels clearly play a central role in the fluid secretion process, but this issue cannot be resolved until the molecular identity of the channel is determined. At present, it is uncertain whether the CLCA or the Best Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels are involved, or if a new family of Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channel proteins will be identified. The recent discovery of an ATP-activated Cl⁻ channel in mouse parotid acinar cells (65) further complicates the overall picture but suggests an attractive alternative mechanism to explain the synergism often seen when both Ca²⁺ and cAMP signaling systems are activated (126, 127). ATP is released from secretory granules, and if the ATP-activated Cl⁻ channel is expressed in the apical surface of the acinar cell, then activation of this channel in parallel with the Ca²⁺-activated Cl⁻ channels could result in enhanced secretion. This makes sense functionally, as the increased fluid production would be important for washing the proteins discharged from the secretory granules through the ductal system. Many challenges remain, most urgent the molecular identification of this channel and its localization in acini.

It is clear that the agonist-induced increase in the intracellular [Ca²⁺] upregulates most, if not all, key downstream ion transporters, but the mechanism for this regulation remains ambiguous in most cases. Does Ca²⁺ directly stimulate each transporter or is a kinase or other regulatory protein required? Moreover, a better understanding of the spatial and temporal aspects of the [Ca²⁺] signal and the specific pathways modulating such signals might shed light on the mechanisms involved in regulating these ion transporters. Further elucidation of the details of these regulatory processes will ultimately lead to improved therapies for salivary gland dysfunction.

Acinar cell secretion model based on the entry of Cl⁻ across the basolateral membrane mediated by a Na⁺/K⁺/2Cl⁻ cotransporter and the paired Na⁺/H⁺ and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchangers. Cl⁻ exit across the apical membrane via a Cl⁻ channel. Acinar cells are homogeneous, therefore the different transport elements are spread out for clarity, but all occur in each cell.

Figure 2 HCO₃⁻-dependent secretion. In this model intracellular carbonic anhydrases generate HCO₃⁻ by catalyzing the reversible reaction of water and CO₂ to form HCO₃⁻ and H⁺ to drive acinar cell secretion. HCO₃⁻ drives secretion via two mechanisms: (a) Cl⁻ entry occurs in exchange for intracellular HCO₃⁻ across the basolateral membrane mediated by the paired Na⁺/H⁺ and Cl⁻/HCO₃⁻ exchangers and Cl⁻ exits across the apical membrane via a Cl⁻ channel. (b) HCO₃⁻ generated by carbonic anhydrases exits across the apical membrane via a Cl⁻ channel.

SALIVARY GLAND SECRETION MECHANISM

Figure 3 Ca²⁺ mobilization. The cell, shown in brightfield, was loaded via the patch pipette with 3 μM NPE-caged 1,4,5-InsP₃ and 75 μM OGB-2. The pseudocolored panel shows images at the indicated times, post-photolysis of the NPE-caged 1,4,5-InsP₃. Uncaging of the InsP₃ induces an increase in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ that is initiated in the extreme luminal portion of the cell after a short latency (~1 image frame). This increase in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ becomes global within 200 ms after photolysis. The upper traces depict the changes in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ initiated by photolysis. The blue trace was taken from a region of interest (ROI) within the luminal region and the red trace was from a ROI in the basal pole of the cell. The inset represents the area on an expanded time scale to illustrate the very short delay between the initiation of the apical and basal signal. The lower trace shows the I<sub>CaCl</sub> activated by the increase in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ, and illustrates the high temporal coincidence of these signals.
