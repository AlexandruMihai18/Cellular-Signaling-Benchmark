ABSTRACT

Purpose: The types of epithelial renal tumors are clear cell, types I and II papillary, chromophobe and oncocytoma. We identified the genetic basis of these different types of kidney cancer to provide better methods for early diagnosis of this disease as well as provide the foundation for the development of molecular therapeutic approaches.

Materials and Methods: To identify the genetic basis of kidney cancer we studied families with an inherited predisposition to kidney cancer. Families in which 2 or more individuals had kidney cancer underwent a comprehensive evaluation to determine whether they were affected with a hereditary form of renal carcinoma. Genetic linkage analysis was performed to identify the gene for inherited forms of renal carcinoma.

Results: The gene for the inherited form of clear cell renal carcinoma associated with von Hippel-Lindau gene was identified. This gene has been found to be a tumor suppressor gene. A new form of inherited renal carcinoma, hereditary papillary renal carcinoma, was identified. The gene for this condition was identified and found to be the proto-oncogene c-Met. A previously unidentified form of familial renal oncocytoma was found. A familial form of chromophobe renal carcinoma and oncocytoma associated with Birt Hogg Dube syndrome was found. The gene for this condition was localized on the short arm of chromosome 17 and it has been identified. We studied families with cutaneous leiomyomas, uterine leiomyomas and papillary renal carcinoma. We identified mutations in the fumarate hydratase gene in patients affected with this disorder, namely hereditary leiomyoma renal cell carcinoma.

Conclusions: Kidney cancer used to be considered a single disease. It is now known that there are a number of different types of cancers of the kidney with different histological patterns and different clinical courses that appear to respond differently to therapy. These different types of kidney cancer are caused by different genes, i.e., they each have a distinct genetic basis. Understanding the molecular pathways of these cancer genes should provide insight into their varying clinical courses and responses to treatment as well as provide the foundation for the development of disease-specific molecular therapeutic strategies.

KEY WORDS: kidney, kidney neoplasms, gene expression, epithelium

Kidney cancer affects 32,000 Americans annually and it is associated with almost 12,000 deaths in the United States each year.¹,² Cases of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) have been steadily increasing in the United States at a dramatic rate. Between 1975 and 1995 renal cell cancer incidence rates increased annually 2.3% in white men, 3.1% in white women, 3.9% in black men and 4.3% in black women. As would be expected, there were increases in the rate of localized tumors, although there were also increases in advanced renal carcinomas.³ Patients who are found to have localized kidney cancer have an excellent prognosis but those with advanced disease have significantly decreased survival. Five and 10-year survival is 95% for stage I, 88% and 81% for stage II, and 59% and 43% for stage III, respectively, while those presenting with stage IV renal cell carcinoma have only 20% 5-year and 14% 10-year survival.⁴

Kidney cancer used to be considered a single disease. It is now known that there are a number of distinctly different types of cancer of the kidney, each with a different histological pattern and a different clinical course, and each caused by a different gene. Approximately 75% of kidney cancers are clear cell, 15% are papillary, 5% are chromophobe and 5% are oncocytoma. There are at least 2 types of papillary renal carcinoma and the recently described medullary renal carcinoma comprise less than 1% of cases. Medullary renal carcinoma is a particularly aggressive variant of papillary renal carcinoma that was initially described as occurring in patients who are sickle trait positive.⁶ Medullary renal carcinoma has many histological and genetic characteristics in common with collecting duct carcinoma (fig. 1).

cinoma we studied the hereditary forms of renal cell carcinoma with the hope that identifying the gene(s) for the hereditary forms of renal carcinoma might lead to the genes for the common forms of sporadic renal cell carcinoma. Because there are a number of histological types of renal carcinoma, there are a number of hereditary types of renal carcinoma. Each type of hereditary renal carcinoma is associated with a different histological type of renal carcinoma. 1) von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) is a hereditary form of clear cell renal carcinoma. 2) Hereditary papillary renal carcinoma (HPRC) is a hereditary form of papillary renal carcinoma (papillary type 1). 3) Birt Hogg Dubé (BHD) is a hereditary form of chromophobe renal carcinoma and oncocytoma. 4) Leiomyomatosis renal cell carcinoma (HLRCC) is a hereditary form of papillary renal carcinoma (papillary type 2) (see Appendix, fig. 2).

## VHL: THE HEREDITARY FORM OF CLEAR CELL RENAL CARCINOMA

To identify the gene for sporadic, clear cell carcinoma we studied VHL disease. At risk individuals with VHL are at risk for bilateral multifocal renal cell carcinoma, bilateral multifocal pheochromocytoma, pancreatic tumors (malignant neuroendocrine tumors) and cysts, epididymal cystadenomas, cerebellar and spinal hemangiomas, retinal angiomas and endolymphatic sac tumors in the inner ear. Renal tumors in VHL are uniformly of the clear cell histological type and they appear in 35% to 45% of affected individuals with VHL. Renal tumors are found most often in patients

FIG. 2. Like prostate and bladder cancer, kidney cancer can occur in sporadic (noninherited) as well as hereditary (inherited) forms. Sporadic kidney cancer tends to occur as single lesion. Inherited forms of kidney cancer can be bilateral and multifocal.

with partial deletions of the VHL gene or with mutations that shorten VHL protein. These tumors are often early onset and they have been observed in adolescents. In a detailed study of the prevalence of renal tumors and cysts in VHL Walther et al estimated that there could be up to 600 microscopic clear cell neoplasms and 1,100 cysts in an average VHL kidney. These tumors are malignant tumors that can metastasize. Historically up to 40% of untreated patients with VHL have died of advanced renal cell carcinoma (fig. 3).

### CLINICAL MANAGEMENT: VHL RENAL TUMORS

A clinical strategy has been developed to treat patients with nephron sparing partial nephrectomy when possible. This strategy involves expectant management of tumors less than 3 cm and surgical intervention when the tumor reaches the 3 cm threshold. When surgery is performed, intraoperative ultrasound is done, and all renal tumors and cysts are removed. This strategy is not intended to rid the patient of all microscopic tumors. Rather surgery is performed with the intent of prolonging the patient life, while at the same time providing the maximal possible time with the native kidneys intact. In a recent report of a 10-year experience with this strategy Herring et al had no patient with metastatic disease who was treated in this fashion.

### VHL PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA

Adrenal tumors, which are uniformly pheochromocytomas, can occur as early as age 8 years. Pheochromocytomas are often bilateral, and they can be extra-adrenal or malignant. These cases are routinely managed by laparoscopic surgery, often using partial adrenalectomy. The same strategy is used to manage adrenal tumors as renal tumors, ie to attempt to preserve function of the native adrenal gland for as long as possible.

### IDENTIFICATION OF THE VHL GENE ON CHROMOSOME 3

An international consortium was formed to identify the VHL gene, and Glenn and Latif et al reported the identification of the VHL gene. Affected individuals with VHL were found to have a mutation of the VHL gene in the germline. The availability of a simple blood test made presymptomatic testing for VHL reliable and accurate. Individuals at risk for this hereditary cancer syndrome can now undergo a simple blood test to determine whether they are at risk for VHL associated tumors in the kidney, adrenal gland,

pancreas, etc. Initial studies showed the detection of germ- line mutations in the VHL gene in 39% to 75% of VHL kindreds. Improvements to the technique have been made and currently germline VHL mutations can be detected in a high percent of families. Stolle et al recently reported the detection of germline mutations in 99% of VHL families tested (92 of 93).<sup>24</sup> In a recent analysis at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), VHL germline mutations were detected in 201 of 201 kindreds tested (data not shown).

CLEAR CELL RENAL CARCINOMA: VHL GENE MUTATION

To determine the role of the VHL gene in kidney cancer tumors from patients with sporadic noninherited kidney cancer were studied. VHL gene mutations were found in a large percent of tumors from patients with clear cell renal carcinoma, while VHL gene mutation was not found in tumors from patients with papillary renal carcinoma.<sup>25,26</sup> This study provided the initial foundation for the development of a molecular genetic classification of renal carcinoma based on gene mutation status.

THE VHL KIDNEY CANCER GENE IS A TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE

In the classic 2-hit model described by Knudson and Strong, a tumor suppressor gene is a gene in which the 2 copies of the gene are inactivated.<sup>27,28</sup> The original Knudson models were based on observations of retinoblastoma. In VHL tumors, the inherited (germline) copy of VHL is mutated and the second copy of the VHL gene is also inactivated, most often by deletion of the gene. Inactivation of each copy of the VHL gene is found in sporadic noninherited clear cell renal carcinoma. In a high percent of clear cell renal carcinomas, 1 copy of the VHL gene is inactivated by mutation and the other copy is lost by the deletion of DNA.<sup>25,26</sup> Therefore, the VHL gene fits the classic description of a Knudson 2-hit tumor suppressor gene.<sup>29</sup>

To provide further evidence of a tumor suppressor function

for the VHL gene in renal cancer, Gnarra et al placed a normal copy of the VHL gene in clear cell kidney cancer cell lines that were VHL –/–, i.e., the 2 copies of the VHL gene were inactivated.<sup>30</sup> The VHL –/– clear cell kidney cancer lines formed tumors in nude mice. However, when cell lines with the normal WT copy of the VHL gene were placed in the mice, small or no tumors formed. These studies provide strong evidence for concluding that a fundamental aspect of the role of the VHL gene in cancer is as a loss of function, tumor suppressor gene (fig. 4).

FUNCTION OF THE VHL KIDNEY CANCER TUMOR SUPPRESSOR GENE: THE VHL PATHWAY

When the VHL gene was identified, nothing was known about its function. Analysis of the sequence of the gene provided no clues to its function, to where the VHL protein worked in the cell, whether it was a transmembrane receptor, primarily cytoplasmic, etc. Among the initial insights about the function of the VHL protein was the finding that the VHL protein binds 2 proteins called Elongin C and B.<sup>31,32</sup> The elongins are part of a recently identified family of genes that are critical to transcriptional regulation. Subsequently, it was determined that the VHL-Elongin C/B complex binds to Cul-2, a member of the multigene cullin family.<sup>33</sup> These and other findings provided an indication of the potential function of VHL protein. The yeast Cul-2 homologue, CDC53, is part of a ubiquitin ligase complex that targets proteins for degradation.<sup>33</sup> The VHL complex targets a protein called hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF1-α) for ubiquitin-mediated degradation. HIF1-α is a transcription factor that controls the transcription of a number of downstream genes, such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), the glucose transporter (GLUT1), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α), and erythropoietin. These are genes that would potentially be important to a cancer cell. Under normoxic conditions (normal oxygen tension), the VHL elongin C/B-Cul-2 complex targets HIF1-α and degrades it.

FIG. 4. Understanding has grown about VHL gene function and how damage to this gene leads to clear cell kidney cancer. VHL protein targets α subunit of HIF and degrades it normally. In kidney cancer mutant gene product does not target HIFα for degradation and HIFα accumulates (A). Understanding VHL gene pathway has led to development of number of molecular targeting strategies with small molecules (B) or antibodies (C) for potential treatment of patients with advanced clear cell renal carcinoma.

Under hypoxic conditions (when oxygen tension is low) the VHL complex does not degrade HIF1-α and HIF1-α accumulates. This accumulation of HIF1-α leads to the subsequent over expression and increased levels of VEGF, GLUT1, PDGF, TGF-α and erythropoietin.

VHL GENE MUTATION RESULTS IN INCREASED EXPRESSION OF VEGF, GLUT-1, PDGF, TGF-A AND ERYTHROPOIETIN

The VHL gene is mutated in the germline of patients with the hereditary form of clear cell renal carcinoma associated with VHL as well as in sporadic nonhereditary clear cell renal carcinoma.¹,²³,²⁵ Inactivation of the VHL gene by mutation results in inability to target HIF1-α for degradation, resulting in HIF1-α accumulation (fig. 9, A). It can result in increased transcription of VEGF, GLUT-1, PDGF, TGF-α and erythropoietin.³⁴,³⁵ An increase in factors such as VEGF could explain why such tumors as clear cell renal carcinoma are so vascular. An increase in glucose transport into the tumor secondary to an increase in GLUT-1 expression and increased production of potentially autocrine acting growth factors such as PDGF and TGF-α could be crucial to the fundamental neoplastic state of clear cell renal carcinoma.

MOLECULAR TARGETING OF CLEAR CELL RENAL CARCINOMA

If HIF1-α is the primary target of the VHL kidney cancer tumor suppressor complex, it raises the possibility that the blockade of HIF1-α function could be a therapeutic possibility for treating patients such as those with clear cell renal carcinoma (fig. 9, B). The recent results of molecular targeting with STI-571 (Gleevec, Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corp., East Hanover, New Jersey) in chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST)³⁶,³⁷ is considered by many to provide “proof of principle” that molecular targeting in cancer is no longer a hypothetical possibility in the distant future. These clinical trials, showing response in both hematologic malignancies as well as advanced solid

PAPILLARY KIDNEY CANCER: HEREDITARY PAPILLARY RENAL CARCINOMA (HPRC) TYPE I

To identify the genetic basis for papillary kidney cancer scientists studied patients with other types of inherited forms of kidney cancer. In 1994 Zbar et al described an inherited form of renal carcinoma named HPRC.³⁸ HPRC is an inherited form of renal carcinoma in which affected individuals are at risk for bilateral, multifocal type I papillary renal carcinoma.

Detailed analysis of HPRC kidneys revealed a predicted prevalence of 1,100 to 3,400 microscopic tumors per kidney. This disease is autosomal dominant and highly penetrant, ie in gene carriers there is a high likelihood of papillary kidney cancer by age 80 years.³⁹ While in VHL kidney cancer is uniformly the clear cell type, in patients with HPRC papillary renal cancer develops. Kidney cancers in HPRC are most often late onset, ie in the 4th, 5th and 6th decades of life, although kindreds have been identified that appear to have earlier onset papillary kidney cancer (Pautler et al, unpublished data). These papillary kidney cancers are malignant cancers that can metastasize. Patients with HPRC have died as a result of metastatic renal cell carcinoma. The current management strategy is to recommend surgical intervention when a renal tumor reaches the 3 cm threshold.¹⁶ The goal of this surgical approach is to remove tumors before they metastasize, while maintaining the patient native kidneys intact for as long as possible (fig. 5).

THE GENE FOR HEREDITARY PAPILLARY RENAL CARCINOMA: C-MET ONCOGENE

To identify the gene for HPRC, HPRC kindreds were evaluated for papillary kidney cancer and genetic linkage analysis was performed. The gene was found to be located at

GENETIC BASIS OF KIDNEY CANCER

FIG. 5. Patients with HPRC are at risk for bilateral, multifocal type 1 papillary renal carcinoma. Reduced from ×20<sup>38,60</sup>

chromosome 7q31.1-34 in a 27 cM interval between the 2 anonymous markers D75496 and D751837. Missense mutations were found in the tyrosine kinase domain of the MET gene in the germline of affected members of HPRC kindreds.<sup>40</sup> Three mutations in the MET gene were found to be located in codons that were homologous to those in the c-kit and RET oncogenes. These findings suggested that the missense mutations located in the MET proto-oncogene lead to constitutive activation of the MET protein in papillary renal carcinomas. Mutations of the MET gene were also found in a subset of sporadic, noninherited type I papillary renal carcinomas.

THE HPRC GENE C-MET IS A PROTO-ONCOGENE

Met gene mutations in HPRC and sporadic type I papillary kidney cancer are activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the gene. When a normal WT copy of the Met gene as well as a copy of the Met gene with the germline Met mutation from family 150 was put in 3T3 cells and grown in soft agar transformation assay, the cells with the family 150 germline mutation formed colonies (an indication of transformation), whereas the cells with the normal copy of Met did not (fig. 10). Likewise, when the 2 sets of cells were implanted subcutaneously in nude mice, it was the cells with the activating mutation of Met that formed tumors (fig. 6).

CLINICAL APPLICATIONS

With the identification of the gene for HPRC predictive testing is now available for kindreds suspicious for HPRC and for individuals in known HPRC kindreds at risk for carrying the disease gene.<sup>39</sup> Mutation analysis from tissue from sporadic papillary renal carcinomas can now be tested to determine the genetic basis of this disease and confirm the histological diagnosis.

POTENTIAL MOLECULAR TARGETING: MET IN PAPILLARY KIDNEY CANCER

gene. The germline and somatic Met mutations are activating mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain.⁴¹,⁴² This tyrosine kinase is a potential target for small molecules that block the tyrosine kinase activity of this gene. This strategy has been successfully accomplished with a disease associated with activating mutations in the homologous domains of c-Kit, a gene with remarkable similarity to c-Met. STI-571 has been successfully used to treat patients with CML as well as with GIST. STI-571 blocks the tyrosine kinase activity associated with c-Kit mutations in GIST and with the c-ABL gene in CML. Recent clinical trials showed remarkable effectiveness of this agent in patients with CML and in those with GIST.³⁶,³⁷ Intense efforts are underway to develop agents such as small molecules that inhibit tyrosine kinase activity of genes such as Met as potential therapies for cancer. Burke et al have developed small molecules that specifically inhibit the Met pathway.⁴³ These and related agents are currently being evaluated in vitro and in vivo models of kidney cancer to determine if inhibition of the Met pathway affects the growth of renal cell carcinoma.

HEREDITARY CHROMOPHOBE RCC/ONCOCYTOMA: BHD SYNDROME

In 1998 Weirich et al described a familial form of renal oncocytoma.⁴⁴ In this initial report of the hereditary form of renal oncocytoma 12 affected males and 5 affected females from 5 kindreds were reported. In affected family members renal oncocytomas were often bilateral and multifocal. This report provided the basis for the studies to follow on the inherited basis of renal oncocytoma and chromophobe renal carcinoma. Studies of the inherited forms of oncocytoma were expanded and patients from North America were brought to the NCI for evaluation. Soon it was noted that many individuals in these kindreds had cutaneous tumors on the face and neck. Biopsy of these small tumors revealed hair follicle tumors, fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas. An inherited autosomal dominant form of fibrofolliculoma was described

in 1977 by Birt et al.⁴⁵ In 1993 Roth et al reported on a patient with BHD who had bilateral, multifocal chromophobe renal cell carcinoma.⁴⁶

To determine the phenotypic manifestations of BHD and the prevalence of renal tumors in these patients 152 patients with BHD were evaluated.⁴⁷ Individuals affected with BHD were found to be at risk for cutaneous fibrofolliculoma, lung cysts and renal tumors. Cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations were found to be present in a high percent of affected individuals (almost 90%). Cutaneous lesions tend to appear on the face, neck and superior trunk. Pulmonary cysts are most often asymptomatic and do not result in decreased pulmonary function, although spontaneous pneumothorax can be seen in up to 25% of affected individuals (fig. 7).

KIDNEY CANCER: BHD SYNDROME

Kidney cancer may develop in 15% to 30% of affected BHD cases. The cancers are often bilateral and multifocal. The most common types of histological types of renal tumor in BHD are chromophobe renal carcinoma, oncocytic-transition neoplasms and oncocytoma. In a recent study of 130 renal tumors in BHD cases Pavlovich et al found a remarkable diversity of renal tumors.⁴⁸ The tumors consisted primarily of chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (44 of 130 or 34%) or hybrid oncocyctic neoplasms (65 of 130 or 50%). Of the 130 tumors 12 were clear cell RCC (9%) and there were 7 oncocytomas (5%) (fig. 8).

IDENTIFICATION OF THE BHD GENE

Families from the United States and Canada were brought to the NCI and evaluated for cutaneous, pulmonary and renal manifestations. Genetic linkage analysis was performed and the BHD gene was localized to a 4 cM area on the short arm of chromosome 17.⁴⁹ Family studies searching for kindreds in which genetic recombinants could further narrow the region of the disease gene led to the identification of the

GENETIC BASIS OF KIDNEY CANCER

cases are most often bilateral and multifocal. These patients often require multiple kidney operations and a strategy of expectant management until the kidney tumors reach a size of 3 cm. The surgical approach is designed to minimize the chance of metastasis, while preserving the patient native kidneys for as long as possible. When the tumor reaches 3 cm, partial nephrectomy with the aid of intraoperative ultrasound is recommended. Nephrectomy is avoided when possible and it is only rarely indicated.

HLRCC/MULTIPLE CUTANEOUS LEIOMYOMA (MCL)

HLRCC and MCL represent a disease complex characterized by the appearance of multiple cutaneous leiomyomas, uterine leiomyoma, uterine leiomyosarcoma and kidney cancer. The cutaneous leiomyomas are often segmental and they can be painful. The uterine fibroids may be multifocal and they can occur at an early age. Uterine leiomyosarcoma has been detected only uncommonly in individuals affected with HLRCC (fig. 9).

HLRCC KIDNEY TUMORS: HISTOPATHOLOGY AND SURGICAL MANAGEMENT

Kidney tumors that appear in patients with HLRCC are different from those that appear in patients with VHL, HPRC or BHD. Whereas VHL, HPRC and BHD tumors tend to be bilateral and multifocal, and grow at a relatively stable rate, HLRCC tumors are often solitary type 2 papillary renal carcinoma. HLRCC kidney cancer should be considered aggressive and it can metastasize early. Although experience with the clinical management of HLRCC renal tumors is less than that with VHL, HPRC and BHD tumors, early surgical intervention is currently recommended in the management of these cases. It is important to recognize the difference between HLRCC, VHL, HPRC and BHD. HLRCC tumors can be extremely aggressive and they can be lethal.

THE GENE FOR HLRCC/MCL: FUMARATE HYDRATASE (FH)

The gene for HLRCC/MCL was found to be the gene that codes for FH, a Krebs cycle enzyme. Germline FH mutations

BHD gene in summer 2002. Mutations of the BHD gene were found in the germline of affected individuals with BHD. These BHD gene mutations were found to be of the type that would predict inactivation of the BHD gene, ie this gene appears to have characteristics consistent with a tumor suppressor gene. Studies are currently underway to determine what type of cancer gene the BHD gene is and whether this gene is involved in the development of sporadic (nonfamilial) forms of chromophobe renal carcinoma and oncocytoma.

CLINICAL MANAGEMENT: VHL, HPRC AND BHD RENAL TUMORS

Groups have described the natural history of and a strategy for surgical management of VHL, HPRC and BHD renal tumors. The tumors in VHL, HPRC and BHD

are found in the germline of HLRCC and as MCL kindreds, ie it is a disease with phenotypic heterogeneity.

VHL, C-MET, BHD AND FUMARATE HYDRATASE GERMLINE MUTATION ANALYSIS: CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS

In known VHL, HPRC, BHD and HLRCC kindreds germline mutation analysis is performed to determine which family members at risk carry the gene and which are not at risk for the manifestations of these hereditary cancer syndromes. Germline mutation analysis is particularly useful in families in which 2 or more individuals are affected with kidney cancer. Individuals who are affected can undergo periodic screening and appropriate surgical intervention can be recommended. The disease spectrum of VHL, HPRC, BHD and HLRCC varies significantly and it is useful for the clinician to have knowledge about which organs are at risk for each disease. For example, current recommendations for renal tumor management in HLRCC are different than those in patients with VHL, HPRC or BHD. In HLRCC cases with kidney cancer early surgical intervention is often recommended.

FAMILIAL RENAL CARCINOMA (FRC)

At our clinic at the NCI we have examined more than 20 families with 2 or more members affected with renal cancer who do not have the clinical features of known inherited forms of renal cancer. We refer to these families as orphan renal carcinoma families because they do not fit into the known categories of inherited renal cancer. In some orphan renal carcinoma families close relatives were affected, while in others distant relatives were affected with renal cancer. Typically in affected FRC cases single clear cell renal carcinoma develops between ages of 50 and 70 years. Data from Iceland suggest that there may be a gene(s) that predispose to familial renal carcinoma and this gene may have a role in susceptibility to common clear cell renal carcinoma (fig. 10).⁵⁹

CONCLUSIONS

Kidney cancer is not a single disease. It is made up of a number of different kinds of cancer that occur in the kidney. The different types of kidney cancer have different histologies and different clinical courses, and they are caused by different genes. It is likely that in the future therapies may be individualized for the different types of cancer of the kidney. Understanding the genetic basis of these cancers provides the potential for better methods of diagnosis. It is hoped that study of the biochemical pathways of these cancer

genes may lead to the development of new forms of therapy for patients with advanced disease.
