**Control of SecA and SecM translation by protein secretion**

Hitoshi Nakatogawa, Akiko Murakami and Koreaki Ito

SecA, the protein translocation ATPase of *E. coli* is subject to secretion-defect-response control. SecM (secretion monitor) encoded by the 5′ region of the secM-secA mRNA is involved in this regulation. SecM translation is subject to transient elongation arrest at Pro166, which is prolonged when export of the nascent SecM is blocked. An ‘arrest sequence’, FXXXXWIXXXGIRAGP, was identified at a carboxy-terminal region of SecM that interacts with the ribosomal exit tunnel. Presumably, the stalled ribosome disrupts the secondary structure of the secM-secA mRNA such that the Shine-Dalgarno sequence for translation of secA is exposed. Mutation studies established that the SecM elongation arrest is required for the viability of *E. coli* as well as for constitutive (in secretion-proficient cells) and upregulated (in secretion compromised cells) expression of SecA. Furthermore, evidence suggests that elongation-arresting SecM has a role of upregulating the functionality of newly synthesized SecA molecules, presumably by bringing the mRNA to the vicinity of the membrane/Sec translocation apparatus. These results are discussed in relation to the versatile nature of SecA in its localization and structure.

### Introduction  
The Sec protein translocase is responsible for translocation of a major class of extracytoplasmic proteins across the plasma (cytoplasmic or inner) membrane of *E. coli*. Its core machinery is composed of an ATPase, SecA, which drives the transmembrane movement of a preprotein and an integral membrane complex, SecYEG, which probably functions as a polypeptide-conducting channel [1]. In addition, a cytosolic factor, SecB, functions in the targeting/chaperoning events in the soluble phase and another membrane complex

SecDF-YajC for optimum *in vivo* functioning of the system. The Sec translocase also functions for integration of several membrane proteins; SRP (signal recognition particle) is a targeting factor for membrane proteins [2] and YidC is an integral membrane factor that functions by itself or in conjunction with SecYEG-SecDF-YajC for the integration [3].

Not much is known about how the genes encoding Sec factors are regulated for their expression. Among others, genes for the two central integral membrane components, SecY and SecE, are co-transcribed with translation/transcription-related genes encoding, respectively, the *spc* operon ribosomal proteins [4] and the NusG transcription anti-termination factor [5]. The expression of these genes might be coordinated with general housekeeping functions, although the expression of *secA* is subject to more specific regulation in response to the protein secretion status of the cell [6]. Its expression is elevated under conditions of compromised translocase activity. In the early days forward genetics, a *secA′-lacZ* gene fusion played an important role in the isolation of mutants partially defective in protein export [7]. Although defects in certain components of protein transport systems also upregulate the phage shock response operon, this regulation is distinct from the secretion defect-response of the *secA* expression [8].

In this review, we discuss the mechanism and physiological significance of the SecA expression regulation, in which SecM, a product of the first open reading frame of the *secA* operon [9], plays crucial roles. Studies of SecM revealed novel mechanisms, by which a nascent SecM sequence within the ribosomal exit tunnel affects translation and functioning of SecA encoded by the immediate downstream region of the message.

#### SecA is a versatile protein with multiple conformations and localizations  
Structure and function of the SecA ATPase have been discussed extensively [1,10,11**,12], and so here we point out only a few salient features that are related to the present discussion.

SecA interacts with several cellular components including ATP, SecB and a preprotein as well as with anionic phospholipids and the SecYEG ‘channel’ of the membrane. It exists both as a soluble form in the cytosol (presumably including an RNA-bound form), on the periphery of the membrane, and as a form that is more extensively integrated into the membrane. SecA adopts multiple conformations depending on its functional and/or localization states. According to the SecA insertion-deinsertion model

[13], productive interaction of SecA with ATP, preprotein and SecYEG leads to its transition into a transmembrane state, hence providing a driving force for the preprotein insertion into the translocation channel [14–16]. Although it exists largely as a dimer in solution, recent studies suggest that it may be monomerized on interaction with membrane components before functioning [17, 18**, 19*, 20].

SecM is involved in the secretion-defect response of SecA translation in a cis-specific manner

A gene initially called ‘X’ located in the upstream of secA in the same operon [9] is now called secM [21, 22]. Oliver and co-workers [9] characterized the mode of secA expression and showed that translation of secA is modulated by multiple mechanisms. The basal secA expression is translationally coupled with the translation of the upstream secM gene [9, 23]. The secM-secA intergenic region of the mRNA can form stem-loop secondary structures and the translation initiation Shine Dalgarno (S-D) sequence for secA can be occluded in a stem region (Figure 1a) [24]. This region is somehow involved in the secretion-defect response [24]. It was also suggested that SecA might act as an autogenous repressor of its own translation by binding to the message [25–27].

The sequence features and the properties of SecM'-PhoA fusion protein suggested that SecM is an exported

Current Opinion in Microbiology

Translational control of secA in response to cellular protein secretion activity. (a) secM and secA are co-transcribed. The S-D sequence for secA tends to be occluded within the stem-loop structure that the intergenic region forms, resulting in lower initiation frequencies of secA translation. (b) Translation of secM stalls at Pro166, while the nascent SecM polypeptide is co-translationally targeted by SRP to the Sec translocase. During the time window of ribosome stalling, the stem-loop structure is disrupted and the S-D sequence is exposed to allow secA translation by other ribosome(s). Thus, SecA is synthesized in the vicinity of membrane, leading to a basal level synthesis of fully active molecules (see main text). (c) In normal cells, the SecM translation arrest is soon released by the ‘pulling force’ provided by the active export reaction. (d) Mature SecM is exported but the periplasmic Prc and other proteases rapidly degrade it. On the cytosolic side, the stem-loop structure of mRNA reforms as the ribosome detaches from it. (e) Under conditions of lowered secretion activities, such as at low temperature [40], translation arrest of secM (hence exposure of S-D) prolongs, leading to higher frequencies of secA translation. Although some artificial secretion block could lead to a failure of mRNA targeting, physiological fluctuations will preserve SecA synthesis near the membrane.

protein [28]. Most interestingly, an elegant genetic study by Oliver et al. [29] showed that the export status of SecM affects translation of secA in cis-specific manners. Thus, signal sequence mutation in SecM acted to upregulate the SecA translation from the same mRNA strand and the prlA mutations in SecY suppressed this phenotype. These results provided the first clue about the secretion-monitoring function of SecM. However, the secM gene product itself remained to be identified and characterized. The seemingly co-translational nature of the SecM export prompted us to study the SecM protein itself [22].

SecM is destined to the periplasm but functions in its ribosome-tethered nascent state, in which its translation elongation is arrested.

SecM can be regarded as a periplasmic protein. However, its two main characteristics precluded its easy detection in the cell. First, it is rapidly degraded after export to the periplasm (Figure 1d), whereas genetic alterations of its carboxy terminus stabilize it. A periplasmic protease Prc is mainly responsible for the degradation [22]. The second and more remarkable peculiarity of SecM is that its translation is stalled transiently at Pro166, five-codons upstream of the secM termination point (Figures 1b and 2a) [22,30**]. The elongation-arrested SecM₁₋₁₆₆ was detected as a ribosome embedded peptidyl-tRNA. Thus, it was suspected that this elongation arrest was a means by which SecM detects a secretion defect of the cell. In other words, SecM monitors the export status of its own nascent chain and modulates the extent of the translation elongation arrest.

Indeed, the elongation arrest was prolonged strikingly when SecM was expressed in cells, in which the Sec translocase function had been compromised because of a mutation in secY or an addition of azide, a SecA inhibitor (Figure 1e) [22]. Importantly, mutations in the SecM signal sequence also caused prolonged elongation arrest, even in otherwise secretion-proficient cells [22,31]. This, together with the earlier genetic implications [29], established that SecM monitors its own co-translational export. We believe that this is the sole function of SecM; the exported molecule has already finished its duty.

SecM contains an arrest sequence that interacts with the ribosomal exit tunnel

By detailed mutation studies we showed that a sequence, FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP, in which X can be any amino acid and the final proline is the position of elongation arrest, is required and sufficient to cause the arrest in the SecM translation elongation (Figure 2a) [30**]. The arrest sequence segment works as an independent translation-arresting element even if engineered to be present within an unrelated sequence context [30**]. As the elongation-arresting property of this sequence was lost when azetidine, a proline analog, is incorporated instead of proline, it

The A2451 residue in 23S rRNA, representing the PTC, is shown by orange spheres. The positions of the arrest-alleviating mutations, A2058 and A749-A753 interval in 23S rRNA as well as Gly91 and Ala93 in L22 are shown by red, yellow and green spheres, respectively.

The residue numberings are those of the E. coli ribosomal large subunit.

was thought that it is the nascent polypeptide product (rather than the corresponding segment of mRNA) that is responsible for the translation halt [22]. This sequence, when arrested in a form of peptidyl-tRNA, should still be near the peptidyl transferase center (PTC) within the interior of the ribosome.

Although arrest-compromising mutations can occur in any one of the residues in FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP, except for Xs, we were able also to isolate arrest-suppressing mutations in other cellular components [30**]. Thus, we used a reporter LacZα with amino-terminally attached SecM arrest sequence to isolate *E. coli* mutants, in which the elongation arrest of this chimeric protein is alleviated partially. Strikingly, all the mutations that have been characterized contained an alteration in one of the selected 23S rRNA or L22 protein residues that are located close to the narrowest constriction of the exit tunnel (Figure 2b). The residues affected were A2058 in domain V and an A749–A753 interval in domain II of 23S rRNA as well as Gly91 and Ala93 of L22. The arrest segment may assume a specific configuration within the tunnel such that it prevents further movement along the tunnel or prevents the PTC reaction.

According to the atomic structure of the *Haloarcula marismortui* ribosome, the ribosomal exit tunnel is about 100 Å-long and its diameter is some 10–20 Å [32,33]. It was argued that this dimension of the tunnel will preclude the tertiary structure formation of the nascent polypeptide and that the tunnel wall is designed such that it does not interact with the product nascent chain. Whereas the PTC-tunnel cavity of the ribosome is essentially composed of RNA, a portion of the tunnel is constricted significantly, which is characterized also as a place, where tips of two r-proteins, L4 and L22, protrude partially into the cavity [33].

Recently, structural studies of Berisio *et al.* [34**] showed that a macrolide antibiotic, troleandomycin (TAO) binds to the RNA wall of the exit tunnel, displacing the β-hairpin region of L22 from the wall and thereby inducing its flipping across the tunnel. It was proposed that the SecM arrest sequence may act like TAO to halt its own passage through the narrow gate of the tunnel, which is now occluded by the L22 tip. This interesting working model of the SecM action raises a tempting speculation that regulated flipping of the L22 β-hairpin might have general roles of modulating nascent polypeptide movement and peptide elongation [34**,35].

### Translocation reaction may pull SecM to release it from the arrested state

That the *E. coli* ribosome cannot continue translation beyond the sequence of FXXXXWIXXXXGIRAGP, especially when it is present within a non-secreted construction, gives us an important message; the ribosome is not a universal translator of genetic messages [35]. Indeed, overproduction of a signal sequence-defective SecM variant is extremely toxic, presumably by disabling a large number of cellular ribosomes. In such emergency situations, rescuing reactions such as trans-translation/ssrA-tagging and the A-site mRNA cleavage [36*,37*] might result. Although the SecM arrest sequence placed within an engineered protein indeed appears to induce such salvage reactions (*T* Sunohara *et al.* personal communication), there is no evidence that the natural *secM-secA* mRNA is effectively subjected to this regulation. We observed that the elongation arrest was unaffected by an *ssrA* mutation (H Nakatogawa, unpublished).

At any rate, the wild-type SecM is only insignificantly toxic as the elongation arrest is soon released by its interaction with the Sec machinery (Figure 1c). Two possibilities can be considered as the mechanism of arrest cancellation. One may be a ‘pulling’ mechanism, in which the force generated by the Sec translocation machinery acts to dissociate the arrest sequence portion of SecM from the wall/gate of the exit tunnel. Alternatively, the ribosome-Sec machinery interaction may allosterically induce a conformational change of the tunnel. In a recent report, Butkus *et al.* [38*] showed that insertion of a hydrophobic sequence that can act as a ‘stop transfer’ element following the signal peptide of SecM abolishes the arrest cancellation. In the other direction, we observed that some 50 residues after the SecM signal sequence are required for the arrest cancellation, and as many as 180 mature residues of ‘post-translationally’ translocated maltose-binding protein is required to effectively cancel the elongation arrest caused by the attached SecM arrest sequence (A Murakami *et al.* unpublished).

The different requirements on the nascent chain sequences for the arrest relief seem to be best explained by the pulling mechanism. Interestingly, export of SecM is SecB-independent and SRP-dependent [22]. In addition, the signal peptide of SecM is unusually long (Figure 2a) [21], which is reminiscent of a transmembrane segment. We speculate that SecM uses the targeting system for membrane proteins [39*] such that it can monitor both protein export and protein integration activities of the cell.

SecM elongation arrest is required not only for the secretion defect-response but also for the constitutive level of SecA translation. When a ribosome stalls at the Pro166 codon of *secM*, it also sterically disrupts the secondary structure of mRNA formed in the *secM-secA* intergenic region (Figures 1b and 1e). A consequence will then be an exposure of the *secA* S-D sequence and an increased initiation frequency of *secA* translation. This is the presumed mechanism by which the SecM controls translation of *secA*. An arrest-abolishing Pro166 to Ala mutation in SecM proved to decrease translation of *secA* by about 70% in a *cis*-specific manner (A Murakami *et al.* unpublished). This mutation is lethal when introduced into the chromosome, unless excess SecA is provided from a plasmid. Thus, the SecM elongation arrest is required to provide the cell with enough SecA to support viability, even if it is transient in the normal secretion-proficient cells (Figure 1b). It was
also demonstrated, using other viable and weaker *secM*  
and ribosomal mutations, that normal elongation arrest is  
required for upregulating SecA levels in response to  
azide addition and to exposure to low temperature  
(Figure 1e).

### Elongation-arresting SecM may help newly  
synthesized SecA molecules to assume the  
working conformation by bringing them to  
the membrane vicinity

The chromosomal Pro166 Ala mutant cells were found  
to be severely defective in protein export. It is noted  
that cellular abundance of SecA and cellular activity of  
protein export do not always correlate and that SecA  
molecules produced from an engineered configuration  
of the *secA* gene that lacks the upstream *secM* gene were  
less functional than those produced from the natural  
*secM-secA* gene complex (H Nakatogawa *et al.* unpublished). Furthermore, shutoff experiments indicate that  
newly synthesized SecA molecules are more functional  
than ‘old’ molecules. We interpret these results to  
mean that the co-translational targeting of SecM to  
the Sec translocation machinery simultaneously brings  
the *secM-secA* mRNA to the vicinity of the membrane/  
Sec machinery. The transient elongation arrest will  
ensure this localization of mRNA and, hence, the  
synthesis of SecA in the membrane/translocon-associated state (Figure 1b).

As already mentioned, SecA can assume multiple con-  
formations. It is conceivable that the conversion of the  
stable dimer form in the cytosol into the membrane-  
associated functional form (possibly a monomer; [18**])  
is less easy than a *de novo* folding of a newly synthesized  
SecA polypeptide that is already in the membrane envir-  
onment. We suggest that the role of SecM is not only to  
ensure enough translation of SecA but also to synthesize  
SecA in a biologically active state. Tian and Beckwith  
[39*] described a *secM* mutant, in which protein export is  
defective while SecA protein level is apparently unal-  
tered. This may also be explained by the SecM’s role of  
the *cis*-acting folding facilitator.

### Conclusions

SecM has provided new concepts in biological regulation  
and gene expression. (i) There is a protein that only  
functions in the ribosome-embedded nascent state. (ii)  
There is a certain sequence that the ribosome cannot  
effectively complete translation. (iii) There is a certain  
amino acid sequence that interacts with ribosomal exit  
tunnel components to halt its own elongation. (iv) A  
nascent peptide region within the ribosome can exert  
regulatory function to affect the quantity and the fate of  
other proteins encoded by the same message. (v) Inter-  
action of the amino-terminal region out of the ribosome  
can feedback affect the intra-ribosomal nascent chain  
interaction with the ribosomal interior components.

   - The authors determined the structure of a complex formed between the large ribosomal subunit and a macrolide antibiotic, Troleandomycin (TAO), which proved to bind to the RNA wall of the exit tunnel, displacing the β-hairpin region of L22 r-protein from the wall and thereby inducing its flipping across the tunnel. It is proposed that SecM acts like TAO to halt its own passage through the narrow gate of the tunnel, which is now occluded by the L22 tip.

   - Together with Sunohara et al. [37*], this paper describes a ribosome-dependent cleavage of mRNA around an empty A-site. This and the ssrA-tagging reaction will provide a mechanism that rescues the ribosome that is facing difficulties in translation.
