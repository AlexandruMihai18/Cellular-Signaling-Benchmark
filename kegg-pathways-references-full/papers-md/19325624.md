**The ESCRT machinery in endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins**

Camilla Raiborg${}^{1,2}$ & Harald Stenmark${}^{1,2}$

Selective trafficking of membrane proteins to lysosomes for destruction is required for proper cell signalling and metabolism. Ubiquitylation aids this process by specifying which proteins should be transported to the lysosome lumen by the multivesicular endosome pathway. The endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery sorts cargo labelled with ubiquitin into invaginations of endosome membranes. Then, through a highly conserved mechanism also used in cytokinesis and viral budding, it mediates the breaking off of the cargo-containing intraluminal vesicles from the perimeter membrane. The involvement of the ESCRT machinery in suppressing diseases such as cancer, neurodegeneration and infections underscores its importance to the cell.

The first known function of ubiquitin was to mark cytosolic proteins for proteasomal degradation, and it is now evident that this small protein also serves to label membrane proteins for lysosomal destruction. Ubiquitin-mediated degradation of membrane proteins is crucial for quality control in the cell and for the attenuation of receptor-mediated signalling pathways. Misfolded proteins in the plasma membrane, as well as activated growth-factor, hormone and cytokine receptors, are brought inside the cell by endocytosis and delivered to lysosomes by multivesicular endosomes (MVEs) (Fig. 1), often referred to as ‘multivesicular bodies’ (MVBs)${}^{1}$. Proteasomal degradation is signalled by polyubiquitin conjugation through lysine residues at position 48 (Lys-48-linked), whereas multiple monoubiquitylation and Lys-63-linked polyubiquitylation mediate protein degradation in the lysosome by functioning as sorting signals in the endosome membrane. Ubiquitylated proteins arriving at this destination are sorted into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) and are not recycled back to the plasma membrane, transported retrogradely to the secretary pathway, or retained in the limiting endosome membrane (Fig. 1).

The molecular basis of ubiquitin-dependent endosomal sorting is now beginning to emerge. In particular, the isolation of vacuolar protein sorting (*vps*) mutants in the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* has identified a conserved mechanism for ubiquitin-dependent sorting of membrane proteins from the limiting membranes into the ILVs of endosomes${}^{2}$. When the resulting MVEs fuse with lysosomes (or, in yeast, the vacuole), the ILV membrane is degraded by lipases and its transmembrane content processed by lysosomal proteases${}^{1,2}$. The endosomal sorting of such cargoes is initiated with their ubiquitylation by specific E3 ubiquitin ligases (reviewed in ref. 3), which often begins at the plasma membrane and continues on endosomal membranes. The ubiquitylation of some membrane proteins may actually serve as internalization signal${}^{4-6}$, although there are many other ways of triggering the endocytosis of specific proteins.

In the endosome membrane, the ubiquitylated cargo is captured by the endosomal sorting complex for transport (ESCRT) machinery${}^{2}$. This conserved machinery performs three distinct but connected functions: first, it recognizes ubiquitylated cargoes and prevents their recycling and retrograde trafficking; second, it deforms the endosomal membrane, allowing cargo to be sorted into endosomal invaginations; third, it catalyses the final abscission (breaking off) of the endosomal invaginations, forming ILVs that contain the sorted cargo. How these three tasks are accomplished is currently being revealed. The emerging picture is that discrete ubiquitin-binding subcomplexes contribute to cargo sorting and the nucleation of a multimeric subcomplex that mediates membrane deformation and vesicle abscission. Here we review how ESCRTs mediate the sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins for lysosomal destruction, and the physiological importance of this pathway.

### Composition and recruitment of ESCRTs

The ESCRT machinery consists of four complexes, ESCRT-0, -I, -II and -III, plus several accessory components (Fig. 2 and Table 1), whose order of recruitment and function has been unravelled by genetic and biochemical approaches${}^{7-12}$. Structural information is available for all ESCRTs, and the detailed structural biology of the ESCRTs has recently been described in excellent reviews${}^{13,14}$.

#### ESCRT-0

This complex consists of the subunits Hrs and STAM (Vps27 and Hse1 in yeast). It was not originally classified as a member of the ESCRTs, but biochemical, cell-biological and genetic evidence suggests that it functions to recruit ESCRT-I (refs 10–12), so it seems logical to categorize it as an ESCRT${}^{14}$. The structure of the ESCRT-0 core complex consists of two intertwined GAT domains, each consisting of two helices from one subunit and one from the other${}^{15}$. An antiparallel coiled-coil connects the two GAT domains. As well as the occurrence of cryptic GAT domains, there are several similarities between the two subunits of ESCRT-0. They both contain an amino-terminal VHS (Vps27, Hrs and STAM) domain of unknown function, as well as ubiquitin- and clathrin-binding domains${}^{16-18}$. What is special to the Hrs subunit is its ability to bind the endosomal lipid phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P) through its FYVE zinc-finger domain${}^{19,20}$. Indeed, PtdIns(3)P binding recruits Hrs, and thereby ESCRT-0, to endosomal membranes${}^{21}$.

A third ubiquitin-binding protein, Eps15b, has been found to be associated with ESCRT-0 in human cells. Although its exact function is not known, this protein is important for the function of ESCRT-0 in sorting

Figure 1 | Endocytic internalization and sorting. Membrane proteins of different kinds are brought inside the cell by endocytosis and translocated to early endosomes, which also receive cargoes from the trans-Golgi network (TGN). Depending on the various proteins that enter the endosome membrane, these cargoes are sorted to distinct destinations. Some cargoes, such as nutrient receptors, are recycled back to the plasma membrane, either directly (step 1a) or indirectly through the recycling endosome (step 1b).

Others, such as receptors for lysosomal enzymes and some protein toxins, are sorted to the TGN (step 2). Ubiquitylated membrane proteins, such as activated growth-factor receptors, are sorted into intraluminal vesicles and eventually end up in the lysosome lumen via MVEs (step 3). In contrast, lysosomal membrane proteins reach their destination by being preferentially sorted to the perimeter membrane of the MVE (step 4). The contents of autophagosomes are also degraded within lysosomes.

epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs) for degradation²². ESCRT-0 is the least conserved of the ESCRTs and is, for instance, not found in plants²³. There are likely to be one or more alternative ESCRT-0 proteins that function either in parallel with or instead of Hrs and STAM. TOM and GGA proteins are good candidates for such a function. Like ESCRT-0, these proteins interact with ESCRT-I and contain VHS, ubiquitin-binding and clathrin-binding domains²⁴,²⁵, and may associate with PtdIns(3) P-binding proteins that target them to endosome membranes²⁶.

### ESCRT-I

The first ESCRT to be characterized was ESCRT-I, initially in yeast and later in mammalian cells⁹,²⁷⁻³⁰. This complex has a 1:1:1:1 ratio of four subunits: Tsg101 (Vps23 in yeast), Vps28, Vps37 and Mvb12 (refs 29, 30). Crystallographic studies have resulted in a structural model of almost the entire ESCRT-I in yeast²⁸. It contains a headpiece (the part that binds ESCRT-II), a rigid 13-nm stalk and an endpiece that contains the ubiquitin- and ESCRT-0-binding UEV domain. The UEV domains of Tsg101 and Vps23 bind to PSAP-like motifs in Hrs/ Vps27, and together with additional interactions these motifs contribute to the endosomal recruitment of ESCRT-I. Consequently, in the absence of ESCRT-0, recruitment of ESCRT-I to endosomal membranes is inhibited¹⁰⁻¹².

### ESCRT-II

ESCRT-II is composed of one Vps36, one Vps22 and two Vps25 subunits³¹⁻³³. The entire core of ESCRT-II consists of eight winged-helix repeats. Vps36 has a split pleckstrin homology domain at its N terminus, which binds 3-phosphorylated phosphoinositides found in the endosome membrane. This domain, known as GLUE (GRAM-like ubiquitin-binding in Eap45), also binds ubiquitin³⁴⁻³⁶. ESCRT-II binds to the ESCRT-I Vps28 carboxy-terminal domain subunit through a helix

Capturing the ubiquitin-tagged cargo

ESCRT-0, -I and -II contain ubiquitin-binding subunits that interact directly with ubiquitylated cargo. Epistasis experiments indicate that the ESCRTs function sequentially according to their numerical order ${ }^{7-9,11}$, although biochemical experiments suggest that ESCRT-0, -I and -II might function as a supercomplex.

ESCRT-0 can be considered as a filter that retains ubiquitylated membrane proteins in the endosome membrane (Fig. 3a). The ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) in ESCRT-0 have low affinity for ubiquitin ${ }^{42-44}$, raising the question of how this complex can function in the efficient sorting of ubiquitylated cargo. One possibility is that simultaneous binding of ESCRT-0 to several ubiquitin moieties in the cargo might strengthen the overall binding. In support of this idea, the ESCRT cargo that has been most extensively studied in mammalian cells, EGFR, is known to become conjugated to several ubiquitin molecules in response to high EGF concentration ${ }^{45}$, either as multiple monoubiquitins or as Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains ${ }^{46}$. Moreover, polyubiquitylation favours the interaction of EGFR with ESCRT-0, which contains several UIMs, and also seems to favour degradative sorting of EGFR (ref. 47). It is worth noting that the UIM of Hrs can bind two ubiquitin moieties, and that mutations that abolish this 'double-sided' binding interfere with the sorting function of Hrs ${ }^{43}$. In contrast, yeast Vps27 contains two single-sided UIMs, both of which are important for MVE sorting but not MVE biogenesis ${ }^{48}$, suggesting that there has been evolutionary pressure to maintain the ability of ESCRT-0 to bind multiple UIMs.

Another way for ESCRT-0 to overcome its feeble affinity for ubiquitin could be to increase its concentration locally. This might be accomplished through the ability of Hrs to bind clathrin through a C-terminal clathrin-box motif ${ }^{17}$, which has been shown to increase the concentration of ESCRT-0 in restricted clathrin coats on endosomal membranes, and to enhance the complex's sorting function ${ }^{42,49,50}$. It is tempting to speculate that ESCRT-0 is first recruited to endosome membranes by PtdIns(3)P binding, and is then clustered in microdomains through the ability of clathrin to polymerize (Fig. 3a).

In contrast to ESCRT-0, ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II each have only one ubiquitin-binding domain. They are therefore less suited to the initial capture of cargo and are likely to function when ubiquitin-containing cargo has already been concentrated by ESCRT-0 (Fig. 3a). The ubiquitin-interacting domains of ESCRT-0, -I and -II all bind to the same hydrophobic patch of ubiquitin at Ile 44, so it has been proposed that cargo could be handed over sequentially from one complex to another. However, the long rigid stalk that separates the ubiquitin-binding UEV domain of ESCRT-I from the headpiece that binds the ubiquitin-interacting GLUE domain of ESCRT-II (see Fig. 2) makes cargo exchange within one ESCRT-I/-II pair highly unlikely. This does not exclude the possibility that cargo can be delivered from the UEV domain of one ESCRT-I/-II pair to the GLUE

domain of another pair. Because there is no complete structural model of ESCRT-0, it is not clear whether cargo exchange between individual ESCRT-0 and -I complexes is structurally feasible. Nevertheless, the directional flow of cargo from ESCRT-0 to ESCRT-I and -II is plausible when one considers the sequential recruitment of these complexes. The ubiquitin-binding domains within these complexes have roughly the same affinity for ubiquitin ($K_{D} \sim 0.1-0.3$ mM), raising the question of how sequential cargo binding might be coordinated. One possibility is that cargo binding is regulated by post-translational modifications. The mammalian ESCRT-0 subunits are known to be phosphorylated on specific tyrosine residues ${ }^{51,52}$ and to be monoubiquitylated ${ }^{53}$. The latter modification keeps these subunits in an inactive form owing to intramolecular interactions between their UIMs and the appended ubiquitin moiety ${ }^{54}$. Tsg101 in ESCRT-0 is also monoubiquitylated by the ubiquitin ligase Mahogunin, which could switch Tsg101 between active and inactive forms ${ }^{55}$.

Deforming the endosome membrane

Electron microscopy has shown that yeast that lack ESCRT components have no ILVs in endosomes and vacuoles, and have a peculiar, multilamellar endosome ${ }^{2}$. Similar studies of mammalian cells have yielded a more complex picture, as short interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletions of different ESCRT subunits have caused distinct phenotypes. Nevertheless, the consensus view is that ESCRT depletion causes reduced ILV formation in mammalian cells as well, and multilamellar endosomes resembling those of yeast ESCRT mutants have been observed in cells depleted of the ESCRT-I subunit Tsg101 (ref. 56). This begs the question of how ESCRTs have this effect on ILVs.

Given our understanding of canonical vesicle budding mediated by cytosolic coats ${ }^{57}$, it is difficult to understand how vesicles can bud into the lumen of an endosome, which is topologically the opposite. Conspicuously, the elongated yeast ESCRT-I spans about 25 nm, which is approximately the size of ILVs in MVEs in yeast ${ }^{28}$. This led to speculation that, in addition to its role in cargo sorting, ESCRT-I might contribute to membrane deformation ${ }^{28}$ (see Fig. 3a, b). Nevertheless, the only experimental evidence so far pertaining to ESCRT-mediated membrane deformation has been obtained with ESCRT-III. High-level overexpression of the ESCRT-III subunit Vps32 in mammalian cells causes protrusion of buds and tubules from the plasma membrane, triggered by spiral filaments formed by Vps32 multimers ${ }^{58}$. Although the plasma membrane is not the normal site of ESCRT assembly, the topology and diameter of these buds and tubules resemble those of ILVs, suggesting that Vps32-mediated plasma-membrane budding reflects key aspects of ILV biogenesis. The finding that plasma-membrane budding is preferentially caused by Vps32, and not by other ESCRT-III subunits, is consistent with the finding that Vps32 is the main constituent of ESCRT-III filaments in yeast ${ }^{39}$.

Figure 2 | Composition and molecular interactions of the ESCRT machinery. Interactions between the four ESCRTs are indicated, as are interactions with ubiquitylated cargo and accessory molecules such as PtdIns(3)P, deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs), Alix and the ATPase Vps4. Mammalian protein names have been used but the figure is a composite of data obtained from studies of yeast and mammalian ESCRTs. Protein domains are labelled in white. CB, clathrin-box motif. Ub, ubiquitin. Dashed arrow indicates interaction predicted by genetic studies but not yet confirmed biochemically.

An even more detailed insight into the assembly of ESCRT-III filaments comes from *in vitro* reconstitution experiments using recombinant proteins. Such experiments have shown that a truncated Vps2A protein that lacks the C terminus can coassemble with Vps24 into hollow helical tubules about 50 nm across with membrane-interaction sites on the outside of the tubule, whereas Vps4 binds on the inside and disassembles the tubule upon ATP hydrolysis⁵⁹. Both Vps24 and a chimaeric Vps24–Vps2 protein also form hollow tubules; the latter can be disassembled by Vps4 (ref. 60). Single-particle electron-microscopy reconstruction of helical Vps24 filaments shows two-stranded tubules containing both parallel and head-to-head subunit arrangements. Vps32 also self-assembles *in vitro*, but these polymers are too disorganized to be suitable for detailed structural studies. The size, topology and Vps4 sensitivity of the ESCRT-III tubules formed *in vitro* suggest they could aid our understanding of how ESCRT-III assembles and functions on endosomal membranes.

In *vivo* data from yeast suggest more ordered functions for the individual ESCRT-III subunits, and only Vps32 seems to homopolymerize into filaments *in vivo*³⁹. Given the structural similarity between the different ESCRT-III subunits, it is possible that high-level expression could enforce polymerization that does not take place *in vivo*, under conditions in which membranes and accessory components are also available. Nevertheless, the *in vitro* assembly experiments provide the first structural insight into how spiral ESCRT-III filaments could form circular arrays and tubular assemblies that are capable of deforming the endosome membrane. The finding that Vps4 acts inside the Vps2A–Vps24 tubules suggests that Vps4 can enter the forming ILVs and depolymerize ESCRT-III from inside⁵⁹, perhaps explaining why ESCRT-III subunits do not enter ILVs⁸.

In mammalian cells, a new player in ILV biogenesis has recently been identified, the PtdIns(3)P-binding protein SNX3 (ref. 61). Depletion of SNX3 prevents ILV biogenesis but not receptor sorting, indicating that it has a specific role in membrane deformation. How this is accomplished is not known, but the fact that depletion of Hrs leads to depletion of SNX3 (ref. 61) suggests that these proteins may form a complex, although this has yet to be demonstrated.

### Membrane abscission from the inside

Membrane abscission during vesicle budding has been well defined for the budding of clathrin-coated endocytic vesicles from the plasma membrane. The GTPase dynamin is thought to mediate the final membrane severing through a GTPase-driven conformational change⁵⁷. The opposite topology of the ‘inverse’ budding into MVes requires a distinct machinery specialized for severing thin stalks of membrane filled with cytosol (Fig. 3c). Unlike classical membrane fission, the machinery needed for this type of membrane abscission is recruited from inside the membrane stalk. Equivalent membrane stalks are also severed during cytokinesis and viral budding from the plasma membrane, and accumulating evidence indicates that ESCRT-III and Vps4 represent a highly conserved machinery for this type of membrane fission (Fig. 4). Phylogenetic analyses indicate that ESCRT-III is the most ancient and conserved of the ESCRTs²³. The other ESCRTs may have evolved later for efficient cargo recognition and perhaps some aspects of membrane deformation. Counterparts to ESCRT-III and Vps4 have been found in archaeabacteria⁶²,⁶³, which have no endomembrane system. In these organisms, ESCRT-III and Vps4 function in plasma-membrane abscission to mediate cell division⁶³.

#### ESCRTs in cytokinesis

Consistent with the idea that the ESCRTs evolved as machinery for cell division, ESCRT-III and Vps4, and to a smaller extent Tsg101, seem to be required for the final membrane abscission step in mammalian cytokinesis⁶²,⁶⁴,⁶⁵. These proteins are recruited to the midbody during cytokinesis through interactions with Alix, a mammalian homologue of yeast Bro1, and CEP55, a centrosomal coiled-coil homodimer that translocates to the midbody ring during cytokinesis⁶⁵,⁶⁶ (Fig. 4). Alix could engage ESCRT-III to mediate final abscission after the fusion of Golgi- and endosome-derived vesicles has served to narrow the mid-body stalk to a thickness of less than 100 nm (ref. 66). Alternatively, ESCRT-I might recruit ESCRT-III through a direct interaction between Vps28 and Vps20, as shown with the corresponding yeast proteins⁶⁷.

#### ESCRTs in viral budding

A related function for ESCRTs, Vps4 and Alix is found in the budding of viruses from the plasma membrane of infected cells. The ‘late’ domain of the structural proteins of various viruses contains three alternative sequences, PPXY, P(S/T)AP and LYPXL, which function as recruitment sites for HECT-domain ubiquitin ligases, Tsg101 and Alix, respectively⁶⁸,⁶⁹. Deletion of these sites causes the failure of membrane

NA, not applicable. In an attempt to simplify, we have mainly used the Vps names of ESCRT subunits, although alternative names exist, especially in mammalian cells, as indicated. Certain mammalian proteins, such as Hrs, Tsg101 and Alix, have such well-established names that their Vps names have been omitted. Note that the assignment of accessory proteins to Vps4 rather than to ESCRT-III is arbitrary in the light of our incomplete understanding of their functions.

Figure 3 | The ESCRT machinery in endosomal sorting of ubiquitylated membrane proteins. **a**, Cargo sorting into clathrin-coated microdomains. Initial recognition of ubiquitylated cargo is mediated by ESCRT-0, which is concentrated in microdomains through interaction with clathrin (pink). ESCRT-0 also serves to recruit ESCRT-I. The elongated ESCRT-I recruits ESCRT-II and may contribute to membrane involution. **b**, Membrane deformation. ESCRT-III complexes are recruited by binding to the two Vps25 subunits of ESCRT-II and form spiral-shaped filaments that gate cargo into invaginations that ESCRT-III filaments cause. During this process, cargo is deubiquitylated by DUBs that are recruited by ESCRT-III, but the diffusion of cargo itself is strictly limited by the ESCRT-III filaments. **c**, Membrane abscission. As ESCRT-III filaments assemble into circular arrays, the membrane continues to invaginate. Vps4 enters the invagination to disassemble ESCRT-III filaments, ensuring that its subunits are recycled and that the filaments assemble only at the neck of the forming intraluminal vesicle. For simplicity, the cytosolic part of the transmembrane cargo (yellow) has been omitted in the figure.

**Deubiquitylation of cargo**

Although ubiquitylation serves as the signal for entry into the MVE pathway, deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) also have important roles in the sorting process. This is illustrated by the finding that Doa4, the DUB that is recruited by ESCRT-III and Bro1 to deubiquitylate endosomal cargo in yeast, is essential for sorting in the MVE pathway<sup>74</sup>. The most straightforward explanation for the requirement of Doa4 is that it mediates the recycling of ubiquitin, thereby avoiding depletion of the cellular ubiquitin pool<sup>75</sup>. However, this is not the only function of Doa4 in the MVE pathway. It has been proposed that Doa4 could also deubiquitylate components of the ESCRT machinery, relieving them of autoinhibition<sup>76</sup>. In mammalian cells, two structurally unrelated endosomal DUBs, AMSH and UBPY, are recruited not only by ESCRT-III and Alix but also by the ESCRT-0 subunit STAM<sup>18,77,78</sup>. The proline-rich domains of these DUBs bind to the same site within the SH3 domain of STAM to mediate their recruitment early in the sorting process. Presumably, these DUBs serve to deubiquitylate cargo that is not destined for the MVE pathway, thereby functioning antagonistically to the E3 ubiquitin ligases that promote MVE sorting. Hypothetically, they could also reverse the autoinhibitory monoubiquitylations of Hrs and STAM. Interestingly, UBPY and AMSH have differential substrate preferences. Although both deubiquitylate Lys-63-linked polyubiquitin chains, UBPY but not AMSH also uses Lys-48-linked polyubiquitin chains as a substrate<sup>77</sup>. This raises the additional possibility that these DUBs might function in the remodelling of ubiquitin chains attached to the cargo.

**ESCRTs and autophagy**

Autophagy, or ‘self eating’, is the process by which cytoplasm, including aggregating proteins, invading microorganisms and damaged organelles, is sequestered by a double-membraned phagophore to form an autophagosome. When the autophagosome fuses with a lysosome, the sequestered cytoplasmic content is degraded by lysosomal enzymes (Fig. 1). A basal level of autophagy has been shown to have a neuroprotective role, although excess autophagy is harmful<sup>79,80</sup>, and the autophagy

of ubiquitylated cytosolic proteins can be considered to represent a second mechanism by which ubiquitin may signal protein degradation in lysosomes. Although it is unclear whether autophagy degrades protein aggregates directly or is important for preventing the accumulation of such aggregates ${ }^{81}$, there is evidence that a ubiquitin-binding protein, p62, mediates both the formation of large ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates and their subsequent clearance ${ }^{82}$. Because p62 interacts with Atg8, which triggers autophagy ${ }^{83}$, it might scavenge small toxic aggregates into larger ubiquitylated aggregates that are presented to the autophagic machinery, thereby mediating the selective autophagy of such structures.

An unexpected connection between the ESCRT machinery and autophagy has recently become apparent. There is a striking increase in the number of autophagosomes when the ESCRT machinery is inactivated, suggesting that this machinery, directly or indirectly, regulates autophagy ${ }^{56,84-86}$. In principle, such an accumulation of autophagosomes could be caused by elevated formation of autophagosomes, perhaps in response to cellular stress occurring in the absence of ESCRT function. However, it seems more likely that the accumulation is caused by the inhibition of fusion between autophagosomes and lysosomes, as autolysosomes are rare in ESCRT-depleted cells. This raises the question of whether there is any connection between ESCRTs and the machinery that fuses autophagosomes and lysosomes. Molecular interactions have been identified between ESCRT-0 and -I components and Vps18, a component of the HOPS machinery that controls the fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes (and endosomes and lysosomes) ${ }^{87}$, but so far the functional significance of these interactions is not known. Furthermore, the final closure of the autophagosome (Fig. 1) principally involves the abscission of a thin membrane stalk filled with cytosol — exactly what the ESCRT machinery is designed for (Fig. 4). This raises the possibility that autophagosomes in ESCRT-depleted cells fail to fuse with lysosomes because of inefficient closure,

a phenomenon that is difficult to detect using standard fluorescence and electron-microscopic methods.

### ESCRTs fight disease

In addition to their role in viral budding, ESCRT proteins also protect against disorders such as neurodegeneration, cancer and bacterial infections. Individuals with missense mutations in the ESCRT-III subunit Vps2B develop neurodegenerative diseases known as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia ${ }^{88,89}$. These diseases are characterized by the progressive neuronal accumulation of ubiquitin-positive protein aggregates, perhaps resulting from decreased autophagy ${ }^{84}$. An alternative explanation to the neuronal death caused by Vps2B mutations is the possibility that impaired downregulation of neurotrophin receptors might cause sustained signalling from endosomes that could induce apoptosis ${ }^{81}$.

Sustained receptor signalling is also a key event in carcinogenesis, and Tsg101, Vps37A and Did2 have been identified as putative mammalian tumour suppressors ${ }^{90-92}$. Conditional knockout of Tsg101 in mice has failed to reveal any evidence for its tumour-suppressor activity ${ }^{93}$, but in the fruitfly *Drosophila melanogaster* ESCRT-I and -II (but not ESCRT-0) behave as tumour suppressors ${ }^{94-96}$. Larval tissues expressing clones of ESCRT-I or -II mutant cells form tumours that are largely attributable to the cell non-autonomous stimulation of proliferation caused by excessive cytokine production by the mutant cells. This is triggered by overactive Notch signalling from endosomes, suggesting that the ESCRT machinery is crucial for silencing Notch signalling and thereby for tumour suppression in flies. Whether this is also the case in mammals remains to be clarified.

The engulfment of microorganisms by phagocytes, followed by their destruction when the resulting phagosomes fuse with lysosomes, is a crucial function of the innate immune system. However, certain

Figure 4 | Involvement of the ESCRT machinery in three topologically equivalent types of membrane abscission. ESCRT-III is a conserved machinery for the abscission of narrow membrane stalks filled with cytosol. In MVE biogenesis (left), ESCRT-III is recruited by ESCRT-0, -I

and -II. In cytokinesis (middle), ESCRT-III is recruited by the centrosome/ midbody protein CEP55 and Alix (and, to a lesser extent, by ESCRT-I). In HIV budding (right), ESCRT-III is recruited by the viral GAG protein and ESCRT-I (and, to a lesser extent, by Alix).microorganisms, including the mycobacteria that cause tuberculosis, have evolved strategies to subvert the phagolysosomal destruction system, allowing them to thrive and replicate intracellularly. ESCRT components have been identified in a screen of *Drosophila* for factors that restrict the intracellular growth of mycobacteria, and their importance has been verified in mammalian cells<sup>97,98</sup>. There is no evidence that MVE biogenesis as such is important for phagolysosomal function, so the importance of ESCRTs in mycobacterial resistance is likely to have other causes. One reason could be the involvement of ESCRTs in autophagy, a mechanism shown to mediate the killing of mycobacteria<sup>99</sup>. Another possibility is that ESCRTs could mediate the fusion of phagosomes with lysosomes by a mechanism similar to the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes.

### Looking ahead

The ESCRTs are derived from a device for cell division in lower unicellular organisms, and have subsequently evolved to recognize ubiquitylated membrane proteins in endosomes, and, following their deubiquitylation, to mediate their translocation into ILVs. It is possible that ESCRT subunits in higher organisms may also have evolved additional functions not related to membrane trafficking.

Advances in structural biology have provided a good picture of the architecture and interaction surfaces of the ESCRTs (Fig. 2), but it remains a major challenge to understand exactly how ESCRT-III assembles on membranes and how this drives inward vesiculation and ILV biogenesis<sup>40</sup>. We also need to understand how ESCRT-0, -I and -II interact with ubiquitylated cargo, and how the cargo is shepherded from its initial contact with ESCRT-0 to the site of endosome invagination. Even though direct cargo transfer between individual ESCRT-I and ESCRT-II complexes is highly unlikely, some means of cargo transfer is required to explain the directional flow of cargo to the budding site. Such delivery could occur in the context of higher-order complexes and might gain directionality by regulated phosphorylation or the ubiquitylation of the ubiquitin-binding subunits. For a thorough understanding of ESCRT-mediated cargo sorting and MVE biogenesis, it might be necessary to reconstitute MVE biogenesis *in vitro* using lipid membranes, purified ESCRT components and ubiquitylated cargo molecules. Experiments of this sort are moving closer as our knowledge of the ESCRTs and their accessory components accumulates. The first *in vitro* reconstitution of ESCRT-III-mediated ILV budding and scission has been published recently, and shows that Vps20, Vps32 and Vps24 are sufficient for detachment of ILVs whereas Vps2 recruits Vps4 to allow recycling of these components for additional rounds of budding<sup>100</sup>. The next step, to reconstitute ESCRT-mediated protein sorting *in vitro*, will be even more challenging, although hopefully achievable in the near future.

This paper is the first to use giant unilamellar vesicles and purified proteins to reconstitute ESCRT-III-mediated ILV abscission in vitro, and proves that Vps20, Vps32 and Vps24 are sufficient for ILV budding whereas Vps4 acts to recycle these proteins.
