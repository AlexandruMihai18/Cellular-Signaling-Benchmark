**Making new contacts: the mTOR network in metabolism and signalling crosstalk**

Mitsugu Shimobayashi and Michael N. Hall

Abstract | More than 20 years after its discovery, our understanding of target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling continues to grow. Recent global ‘omics’ studies have revealed physiological roles of mammalian TOR (mTOR) in protein, nucleotide and lipid synthesis. Furthermore, emerging evidence provides new insight into the control of mTOR by other pathways such as Hippo, WNT and Notch signalling. Together, this progress has expanded the list of downstream effectors and upstream regulators of mTOR signalling.

Cells grow and proliferate when nutrients, growth factors and the cellular energy status trigger carbohydrate catabolism and the synthesis of essential building blocks such as proteins, nucleotides and lipids. The evolutionarily conserved Ser/Thr protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) integrates these stimuli to activate the metabolic pathways that ultimately drive cell growth. Thus, elucidating the function and regulation of TOR is key to understanding how cells and organisms grow.

TOR exists in two functionally and structurally distinct complexes, TOR complex 1 (TORC1) and TORC2 (reviewed in REFS 1,2). The essential core components of mammalian TORC1 (mTORC1) are RAPTOR (regulatory-associated protein of mTOR) and mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC thirteen 8); whereas, those of mTORC2 are RICTOR (rapamycin-insensitive companion of mTOR), SIN1 (SAPK-interacting 1) and mLST8.

mTORC1 is activated by growth factors (for example, insulin), nutrients (amino acids) and the cellular energy status (high ATP/AMP ratio) (reviewed in REF. 3) (FIG. 1). Growth factors such as insulin stimulate mTORC1 through the PI3K–phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1)–AKT pathway (FIG. 1a). Activated AKT phosphorylates tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (TSC2; also known as tuberin) at multiple sites (Ser939, Ser981, Ser1130, Ser1132 and Thr1462) to inhibit TSC1 (also known as hamartin)–TSC2–TBC1D7 (TBC1 (TRE2–BUB2–CDC16) domain family member 7), which is the TSC complex that acts as a GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for the small GTPase RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB)^{3,4}. During inhibition of the TSC complex, GTP-loaded RHEB binds the mTOR catalytic domain to activate mTORC1 through an as yet unknown mechanism^5. The nutrient signal to mTORC1 is transduced through the RAS-related GTP-binding protein (RAG) family of small GTPases (BOX 1; FIG. 1b). An active RAG heterodimer mediates the translocation of mTORC1 from the cytoplasm to the surface of the lysosome, where mTORC1 encounters and is activated by RHEB. A high ATP/AMP ratio activates mTORC1 by preventing the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) (FIG. 1c). In the absence of energy (high AMP/ATP ratio) AMPK phosphorylates TSC2 at Ser1387 (a site distinct from that phosphorylated by AKT) and RAPTOR at Ser792, which leads to mTORC1 inhibition.

After activation, mTORC1 phosphorylates a range of substrates, the best characterized of which are S6K (ribosomal S6 kinase), 4E-BP (eIF4E-binding protein 1) and ULK1 (UNC-51-like kinase 1) (reviewed in REFS 6–8) (FIGS 1,2). S6K has several substrates, including insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1), upstream of mTORC1. Phosphorylation of IRS1 by S6K inhibits IRS1 and thereby PI3K activation, thus forming a negative feedback loop that has an important role in the regulation of mTOR (reviewed in REF. 9).

In comparison to mTORC1 regulation, mTORC2 regulation is poorly understood. Only growth factors stimulate mTORC2 kinase activity, which is mediated through PI3K-dependent mTORC2–ribosome association^{10} (FIG. 1a). The signalling steps beyond phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-triphosphate (PtdIns(3,4,5)P_3) in the activation of mTORC2 are unknown and distinct from those upstream of mTORC1 (reviewed in REFS 11,12). Active mTORC2 phosphorylates the hydrophobic motif in a subset of AGC (named after protein kinase A (PKA), PKG and PKC) family kinases, including AKT (FIGS 1,2).

In this Progress article, we review recent findings on events upstream and downstream of mTOR. Downstream of mTOR, recent global mTOR ‘omics’ studies, such as ribosome profiling, phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, have revealed the broad extent to which mTOR regulates protein, nucleotide and lipid metabolism to promote growth and proliferation. Upstream of mTOR, we focus on non-classical cues that control mTOR, including inputs from the Hippo, WNT and Notch signalling pathways. The crosstalk between these signalling pathways and mTOR is a recent major development in the mTOR field.

### Use of omics in studying mTOR

Large-scale mTOR omics studies have advanced our understanding of biological processes that are regulated by mTOR signalling. Three independent groups have carried out ribosome profiling using cells that had been treated with mTOR inhibitors to identify mRNAs, the translation of which is activated by mTOR^{13–15}. As expected, mRNAs encoding proteins required for protein synthesis were strongly downregulated during mTOR inhibition. The ribosome profiling data also revealed poorly recognized roles of mTOR signalling in cell invasion, metastasis, RNA synthesis and processing, and mitochondria-related functions.

Phosphoproteomics is a powerful method to identify downstream targets of kinases. Three independent studies determined the phosphoproteome of cells treated with mTOR inhibitors (rapamycin and ATP-competitive inhibitors)¹⁶,¹⁷ or lacking RPTOR or RICTOR¹⁸. Of particular note, the first two studies reported that mTORC1 phosphorylates and stimulates growth factor receptor-bound protein 10 (GRB10), which leads to feedback inhibition of insulin–PI3K signalling¹⁶,¹⁷. The third phosphoproteome revealed a mechanism by which mTORC1 controls nucleotide synthesis¹⁸ (see below). The transcriptome of *Tsc1⁻/⁻* and *Tsc2⁻/⁻* mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) that had been treated with rapamycin revealed that mTORC1 promotes the transcription of genes involved in glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) and *de novo* lipogenesis¹⁹. The observed upregulation of these genes was consistent with the metabolome of *Tsc2⁻/⁻* MEFs¹⁹. Hyperactivation of mTORC1 in *Tsc2⁻/⁻* MEFs increased glycolysis (glucose uptake and lactate production) and the biosynthesis of PPP metabolites and lipids. In a more recent metabolomic study, *Tsc2⁻/⁻* MEFs that had been treated with rapamycin were used to identify nine metabolites that are positively regulated by mTORC1 (REF. 20). Most of the mTORC1-regulated metabolites were part of the PPP, which is in agreement with the previous transcriptomic and metabolomic study¹⁹. The mTORC1-dependent metabolome also revealed that mTORC1 stimulates the production of N-carbamoyl-L-Asp as part of the first step in *de novo* pyrimidine synthesis. Together, these mTOR ‘omics’ studies have opened new avenues for mTOR biology, as discussed below.

### mTOR controls metabolism

mTOR promotes growth by stimulating *de novo* synthesis of primary building blocks such as proteins, nucleotides and lipids, and by inhibiting autophagy.

#### Protein synthesis

It has long been known that mTORC1 controls protein synthesis by inducing ribosome biogenesis and mRNA translation (reviewed in REF. 6). mTORC1 phosphorylates S6K on its hydrophobic motif (Thr389), which activates S6K to phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6 (a component of the 40S ribosomal subunit) at five Ser residues (FIG. 2Aa). mTORC1 also phosphorylates the translation inhibitor 4E-BP, causing the release of 4E-BP from the key initiation factor eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E). This enables eIF4G to bind eIF4E at the 5′-end of mRNAs to promote

cap-dependent translational initiation. It was recently shown that 78% of ribosome biogenesis mRNAs are downregulated in whole-body S6K1- and S6K2-double-knockout mice²¹. Interestingly, knock-in mice in which the five S6K target serines (Ser235, Ser236, Ser240, Ser244 and Ser247) in S6 are mutated to alanine (S6<sup>P−/−</sup> mice; P indicates phosphorylation) are also defective for ribosome biogenesis mRNA expression. These findings suggest that the mTORC1–S6K–S6 axis indirectly promotes protein synthesis by increasing ribosome biogenesis. S6K may also control protein synthesis by phosphorylating eIF4B²² and eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K)²³, and by physically interacting with eIF3 (REF. 24); although, how these events affect global translation needs further study.

Despite the evidence suggesting that S6K promotes protein synthesis, S6K-deficient muscle and liver cells do not exhibit a defect in global protein synthesis²¹,²⁵. Moreover, treatment of cells with the mTORC1 inhibitor rapamycin only weakly inhibits global translation¹³,¹⁵. In contrast to the addition of rapamycin, the addition of Torin1 or INK128, two ATP-competitive inhibitors of mTOR, inhibits overall mRNA translation¹³,¹⁵. The stronger effect of Torin1 and INK128 on translation is probably due to their ability to completely inhibit mTORC1 and mTORC2, whereas rapamycin only weakly inhibits mTORC1 alone¹³,²⁶ (BOX 2). Furthermore, Torin1 has only a minor effect on global translation in 4E-BP-deficient cells¹⁵. These data suggest that mTORC1 stimulates global translation mainly by inhibiting 4E-BP.

How do S6k1<sup>−/−</sup> S6k2<sup>−/−</sup> cells maintain global translation, even though the transcription of ribosome biogenesis genes is defective? It has been suggested that S6k1<sup>−/−</sup> S6k2<sup>−/−</sup> and S6<sup>P−/−</sup> mice activate a compensatory mechanism through inhibition of 4E-BP, which upregulates protein synthesis in the absence of robust ribosome biogenesis gene expression²¹.

In addition to a positive role in global translation, mTORC1 preferentially promotes the translation of a subset of mRNAs that contain a 5′ oligopyrimidine tract (termed a 5′ TOP). 5′ TOP-containing mRNAs encode components of the translation machinery such as ribosomal proteins and elongation factors. Recently, two independent ribosome profiling studies confirmed that most mRNAs that are translated in an mTOR-dependent manner contain a 5′ TOP¹³,¹⁵. One study demonstrated that mTORC1 promotes the translation of 5′ TOP-containing eEF2 mRNA by inhibiting 4E-BP¹⁵. These ribosome profiling studies also identified

**Box 1 | Mechanism by which mTORC1 senses amino acids**

Amino acids signal to mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) through the RAS-related GTP-binding protein (RAG) family of small GTPases⁷²,⁷³. The RAGs form heterodimers of either RAGA or RAGB with either RAGC or RAGD. Amino acids, in particular Leu, convert heterodimers to the active conformation in which RAGA or RAGB is loaded with GTP and RAGC or RAGD is loaded with GDP (see the figure). The active RAG heterodimer recruits mTORC1 to the surface of the lysosome where mTORC1 binds RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB; GTP-loaded RHEB activates mTORC1).

Several mechanisms have been proposed for how amino acids signal to RAG and thus mTORC1. For example, amino acids might be sensed in the lumen of the lysosome and signal to the RAGs through the vacuolar H⁺-ATPase (v-ATPase) and Ragulator⁷⁴,⁷⁵. Ragulator is a pentameric complex that acts as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for RAGA and RAGB⁷⁶. Alternatively, glutaminolysis, the double deamination of Gln to produce α-ketoglutarate (αKG), might activate RAG–mTORC1 through prolyl hydroxylases (PHDs), for which αKG is a cofactor⁷⁷,⁷⁸. Leu binds and activates Glu dehydrogenase (GDH), the enzyme that catalyses the second deamination step in glutaminolysis and leads to αKG production, which provides a mechanism for the activation of mTORC1 by Leu through GDH. The molecular mechanism of how PHD leads to mTORC1 activation needs further investigation.

Two independent studies identified the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) for RAGA and RAGB. Nitrogen permease regulator 2-like protein (NPRL2), NPRL3 and DEP domain-containing protein 5 (DEPDC5) form a complex (GATOR1) that has GAP activity towards RAGA and RAGB⁷⁹,⁸⁰. GATOR2, a complex of Mios, SEC 13 homologue like 1 (SEH1L), DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor 11 (DCAF11; also known as WDR23), WD repeat-containing protein 59 (WDR59) and secretary 13 (SEC13), is a negative regulator of GATOR1. Furthermore, increased minichromosome loss 1 (ml1), a yeast orthologue of DEPDC5, has GAP activity towards GTP-binding protein Gtr1, the yeast orthologue of RAGA and RAGB. More recently, two groups independently identified folliculin (FLCN; which forms a complex with folliculin-interacting proteins (FNIPs)) as a positive regulator of RAG–mTORC1 signalling⁸¹,⁸². One of these studies also demonstrated that FLCN acts as a GAP for RAGC and RAGD to promote the active conformation of RAGC and RAGD⁸². Thus, mTORC1 senses amino acids through RAGs through multiple mechanisms. Proteins shown in green promote mTOR activity. Proteins shown in red inhibit mTOR activity.

a 5′ TOP-like motif¹⁵ and a pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE)¹³ within the 5′ untranslated region of mRNAs that are specifically regulated by mTORC1. PRTE and/or 5′ TOP motifs are enriched in mRNAs encoding proteins that are involved in cell invasion and metastasis, such as Y-box binding protein (YB1; also known as NSEP1), vimentin, metastasis associated 1 (MTA1) and CD44 (REF. 13). Importantly, acute mTORC1 inhibition by INK128 reduced the synthesis of these invasion- and metastasis-related proteins before global protein synthesis was inhibited. Translation of YB1 mRNA, which possesses a PRTE but not a 5′ TOP motif, is dependent on the mTORC1-mediated inhibition of 4E-BP. These studies suggest that the mTORC1–4E-BP axis controls the translation of mRNAs containing 5′ TOP and PRTE motifs. Confirmation of this model awaits examination of the role of 4E-BP in the regulation of more 5′ TOP- and PRTE-containing messages. However, this model is consistent with data showing that 4E-BP selectively inhibits the translation of certain mRNAs²⁷.

In contrast to the role of mTORC1, the role of mTORC2 in protein synthesis is less well-defined. mTORC2 associates with actively translating ribosomes to co-translationally phosphorylate and stabilize substrates. For example, mTORC2 co-translationally phosphorylates AKT at Thr450, which prevents the ubiquitylation of AKT²⁸ (FIG. 2B). More recently, it has been demonstrated that mTORC2 promotes insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) production and ultimately cell proliferation, by also co-translationally phosphorylating IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IMP1) at Ser181 (REF. 29). mTORC2 is activated during its association with the ribosome¹⁰. Elucidating the molecular mechanism of the ribosome-mTORC2 association, and identifying additional substrates that are co-translationally phosphorylated by mTORC2, should provide more insight into the role of mTORC2 in protein synthesis.

**Nucleotide synthesis.** Nucleotides are building blocks for DNA and RNA. Moreover, nucleotides are high-energy molecules that drive specific cellular reactions. For example, whereas ATP is well known as an energy source, UTP or CTP are used to activate carbohydrates such as glucose, galactose and sialic acid for transfer to other molecules. CTP is also an energy source for lipid synthesis. Emerging evidence suggests that mTORC1 stimulates the synthesis of nucleotides (FIG. 2Ab). mTORC1 promotes the expression of PPP genes and thereby stimulates production of 5′-phosphoribosyl-1′-pyrophosphate (PRPP), which acts as a ribose moiety for the synthesis of both purine and pyrimidine nucleotides¹⁹. Recently, phosphoproteomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that mTORC1 acutely stimulates the *de novo* synthesis of pyrimidines, by phosphorylating and activating CAD (Gln-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, Asp carbamoyltransferase, dihydroorotate)¹⁸,²⁰. The three enzymes encoded in the single CAD protein catalyse the first three steps, including the rate-limiting first step, of *de novo* pyrimidine synthesis to form a pyrimidine ring. The activation mechanism involves S6K-mediated phosphorylation of CAD at Ser1859, which resides in a linker region between its Asp carbamoyltransferase and dihydroorotate enzymatic domains. CAD-Ser1859 phosphorylation stimulates the oligomerization of CAD proteins, which brings the biosynthetic enzymes into close proximity and thereby promotes the steric channelling of substrates, leading to increased pyrimidine synthesis¹⁸.

Figure 2 | **mTOR controls metabolism.** Mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) promotes anabolic processes, such as the biosynthesis of proteins, nucleotides and lipids, and inhibits catabolic processes such as autophagy. Aa | mTORC1 phosphorylates (P) the hydrophobic motif (Thr389) in ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K), thereby activating it to subsequently phosphorylate ribosomal protein S6 at the sites indicated to promote ribosome biogenesis. mTORC1 also phosphorylates eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) at multiple sites to inhibit it. Inhibition of 4E-BP stimulates translation initiation, especially of 5′ oligopyrimidine tract (termed a 5′-TOP) and pyrimidine-rich translational element (PRTE) containing mRNAs. Ab | mTORC1 stimulates nucleotide and lipid synthesis. mTORC1 promotes the gene expression of key enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), at least in part by activating sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs). mTORC1 also stimulates CAD (Gln-dependent carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, Asp carbamoyltransferase, dihydroorotate) by S6K-mediated phosphorylation at Ser1859, which leads to CAD activation and the stimulation of *de novo* pyrimidine synthesis. Furthermore, mTORC1 promotes lipogenic gene expression by activating S6K or by inhibiting the nuclear translocation of LIPIN1, both of which activate the transcription factor SREBP. Ac | mTORC1 inhibits autophagy by phosphorylating UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) at Ser758 and ATG14 at multiple sites. During mTORC1 inhibition, AMPK phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser317, and thereby activates ULK1, which phosphorylates Beclin 1 in the vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34)-Beclin 1-ATG14 complex to initiate autophagy. mTORC1 also inhibits autophagy indirectly by blocking lysosome biogenesis, by phosphorylating and inhibiting the nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB). B | mTORC2 co-translationally phosphorylates AKT at Thr450 to prevent its ubiquitylation and degradation. mTORC2 also post-translationally phosphorylates ATK at Ser473 to promote lipogenic gene expression by activation of SREBP1c. Moreover, mTORC2 co-translationally phosphorylates IGF2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IMP1) at Ser181, which stimulates insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) production.

An mTORC1-mediated increase in pyrimidine synthesis stimulates *de novo* DNA and RNA production and progression through S phase of the cell cycle^{18,20}. As most newly synthesized RNA is ribosomal RNA, the increase in *de novo* pyrimidine production also indirectly promotes ribosome biogenesis and thus translational capacity and cell growth.

Does mTORC1 control purine metabolism in addition to pyrimidine synthesis? The cellular concentration of guanine nucleotides has been reported to increase during serum and amino acid stimulation^{18}. However, this increase was not acutely blocked by rapamycin, which suggests that at least a rapamycin sensitive function of mTORC1 does not have an immediate role in GTP synthesis. mTORC1 also promotes α-ketoglutarate (αKG) production by activating Glu dehydrogenase (GDH)^{30}. Mechanistically, mTORC1 activates GDH by preventing its ADP ribosylation by the mitochondrial protein sirtuin 4 (SIRT4). As αKG is a key intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, mTORC1 may stimulate ATP production through activation of GDH.

It remains to be investigated whether mTORC2 controls nucleotide synthesis. mTORC1 activates PPP genes at least in part through the transcription factors sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs)^{19}. As mTORC2, in addition to mTORC1, activates SREBP1 transcriptionally and post-translationally to promote lipogenesis^{31}, mTORC2 might also stimulate the PPP pathway through SREBP1.

**Lipid synthesis.** Cell growth cues upregulate lipid synthesis to sustain the production of new membranes. The transcription factors SREBPs are master regulators of lipogenic genes. mTORC1 promotes lipogenesis by activating SREBPs in an S6K-dependent and S6K-independent manner^{19,32} (FIG. 2Ab). The S6K-independent activation of SREBPs involves mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation and inhibition of LIPIN1, a phosphatidic acid phosphatase that downregulates SREBP activity. In response to growth factors and nutrients, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates LIPIN1 on multiple sites and inhibits its translocation into the nucleus, thereby enabling SREBP-mediated activation of lipogenic genes^{33}. Although these cell-based studies indicate that activated mTORC1 is necessary and sufficient to activate SREBPs, more recent *in vivo* studies suggest that hyperactivation of mTORC1 is not sufficient for SREBP activation.

**Box 2 | A mode of action for rapamycin**

Rapamycin inhibits the highly conserved protein kinase target of rapamycin (TOR) by forming a complex with immunophilin FKBP12 (12 kDa FK506-binding protein; also known as FKBP1A), which then binds directly to mammalian TOR complex 1 (mTORC1) but not to mTORC2 (REF. 83). Although the mechanism by which FKBP12–rapamycin inhibits mTORC1 is incompletely understood, the recently published structure of the mTOR catalytic domain provided additional insight^{84}. An mTOR–mLST8 (mammalian lethal with SEC thirteen 8) complex was crystallized containing full-length mLST8 and the mTOR FAT (named after FRAP, ATM and TRRAP), FKBP12-rapamycin binding (FRB), kinase and FAT carboxy-terminal (FATC) domains, but not the amino-terminal HEAT (common to huntingtin, EF3, PP2A and TOR1) repeats (mTOR^AN^). The structure of the mTOR^AN^–mLST8 complex revealed that accessibility to the catalytic cleft of the mTOR kinase domain is highly restricted. Furthermore, modelling of the FKBP12–rapamycin complex bound to the FRB domain of mTOR suggested that the drug acts by blocking substrate recruitment.

The development of ATP-competitive mTOR inhibitors, which target both mTORC1 and mTORC2, led to the observation that the ability of mTORC1 to phosphorylate eIF4E-binding protein (4E-BP) and UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) is rapamycin insensitive^{26,85}. mTORC1 recruits substrates through regulatory-associated protein of mTOR (RAPTOR), which binds a TOR signalling (TOS) motif in substrate proteins such as ribosomal S6 kinase (S6K) and 4E-BP. Rapamycin may then inhibit the activity of mTORC1 towards some substrates by selectively interfering with the disposition of a bound substrate. The FRB domain has been shown to be required for the recruitment of S6K to the catalytic cleft of mTOR^{84}, which could explain the sensitivity of mTOR-mediated S6K phosphorylation to rapamycin. The FKBP12–rapamycin complex may inhibit the phosphorylation of substrates that require the FRB domain for proper alignment of the substrate in the catalytic cleft. An alternative model for the selective rapamycin sensitivity of mTORC1 is based on an *in vitro* kinase assay of mTORC1. These data suggest that the substrate target sequence, including the phosphoacceptor (Ser more than Thr), is a key determinant of rapamycin sensitivity^{85}. According to this model, rapamycin has greater difficulty inhibiting phosphorylation of target sequences that are ‘preferred’ by mTOR.

impaired SREBP activity and lipogenesis^{34–36}. The defect in lipogenesis of L-*Tsc1*-knockout mice is due to the attenuation of AKT activity through the negative feedback loop^{36}. In addition to the crucial role of mTORC1 in lipogenesis, two independent studies demonstrated that mTORC2 also stimulates lipogenesis, in this case through AKT-mediated activation of SREBP1c. Liver-specific Rictor-knockout mice display impaired AKT-Ser473 phosphorylation, SREBPs activation and lipid synthesis^{31,37}. Therefore, mTORC1, mTORC2 and AKT are required for activation of SREBPs and, subsequently, lipogenesis. For a more comprehensive review of studies on how mTOR controls lipid metabolism, please see REFS 38–40.

**Autophagy.** Autophagy is a multistep degradation process that includes the induction of autophagosomes (double-membrane-bound vesicles), fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes to form autolysosomes, and eventually fission of autolysosomes to release lysosomes and to terminate autophagy. mTORC1 mediates several of these autophagic steps. Rapamycin was shown to induce autophagy in yeast^{41} and mammals^{42} several years ago, but the underlying molecular mechanism was elucidated only recently. A major breakthrough was the identification of pro-autophagic UNC-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) as an mTORC1 substrate^{43–46}. Under nutrient-rich conditions, mTORC1 phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser758 to inhibit its interaction with AMPK and thus prevent autophagy^{46} (FIG. 2Ac). During glucose starvation, AMPK inhibits mTORC1 and hence the phosphorylation of ULK1 at Ser758, which enables ULK1 to interact with AMPK. AMPK in turn phosphorylates ULK1 at Ser317 to activate it. Activated ULK1 is recruited to the vacuolar protein sorting 34 (VPS34)–Beclin 1–ATG14 (also known as Barkor) complex, where it phosphorylates Beclin 1 at Ser15 (REF. 47). This phosphorylation activates the lipid kinase VPS34 to produce phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P), which is essential for autophagosome formation. Therefore, mTORC1 phosphorylates the pro-autophagic kinase ULK1 to prevent its activation by AMPK and thereby inhibits autophagosome formation and autophagy. Moreover, mTORC1 directly phosphorylates and inhibits ATG13, a positive regulator of ULK1 (REFS 43–45). The mTORC1 phosphorylation site (or sites) in ATG13 remains to be determined. mTORC1 also inhibits autophagy by directly phosphorylating ATG14 on multiple sites (Ser3, Ser223, Thr233, Ser383 and Ser440). This phosphorylation of ATG14 inhibits PtdIns3P production by the associated kinase VPS34 (REF. 48). Finally, loss of

mTORC1-mediated phosphorylation of death-associated protein 1 (DAP1) at Ser3 and Ser51 during mTORC1 inhibition prevents excessive autophagy⁴⁹. How DAP1 limits its autophagy is not known, but one possible mechanism is that dephosphorylated and active DAP1 decreases the activity of ULK1 or VPS34.

Autophagy provides nutrients to the cell, which in turn reactivates mTORC1 to terminate autophagy. Furthermore, mTORC1 terminates autophagy by promoting the release of tubular proto-lysosomes from autolysosomes⁵⁰. The molecular mechanism through which mTORC1 promotes this termination step remains to be determined. mTORC1 also controls autophagy indirectly by inhibiting the transcription of genes required for lysosome biogenesis. It phosphorylates transcription factor EB (TFEB) and thereby retains it in the cytoplasm⁵¹⁻⁵³ (FIG. 2Ac). Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 or inactivation of lysosomes leads to the dephosphorylation and nuclear translocation of TFEB. Once in the nucleus, TFEB promotes the transcription of genes that encode proteins required for lysosome biogenesis and autophagy. Ser142 (REF. 51) and Ser211 (REFS 52,53) are the key phosphorylation sites that regulate TFEB localization. mTORC1 phosphorylates purified TFEB at Ser142 *in vitro*, which suggests that mTORC1 phosphorylates TFEB directly. Phosphorylation of TFEB at Ser211 induces 14-3-3 binding, which retains TFEB in the cytoplasm, whereas a Ser142Ala alteration has no effect on 14-3-3 binding. Hence, it is still unclear how Ser142 phosphorylation inhibits the nuclear translocation of TFEB. In addition, it remains to be demonstrated whether mTORC1 directly phosphorylates TFEB on Ser211. More recently, it has been shown that RAG GTPases mediate the recruitment of TFEB to lysosomes for phosphorylation by mTORC1 (REF. 54). TFEB is still recruited to lysosomes in starved cells overexpressing active RAG heterodimers, which indicates that active RAGs are necessary and sufficient to promote the lysosomal translocation of TFEB. By contrast, another study reported that mTORC1 promotes the nuclear localization of TFEB⁵⁵. In this study, TFEB localization was assessed in *Tsc2*⁻/⁻ MEFs without supplementing the growth medium with Gln. As *Tsc2*⁻/⁻ cells are energetically stressed in the absence of glucose and Gln⁵⁶, the observed TFEB activation in *Tsc2*⁻/⁻ MEFs may be a compensatory mechanism to overcome stress. Further investigation is required to elucidate this possible compensatory mechanism.

### Non-classical mTOR inputs

The so-called ‘classical’ mTOR inputs are growth factors, nutrients and cellular energy. Recent studies report that mTOR also responds to other inputs via the Hippo, WNT and Notch signalling pathways. The Hippo pathway determines organ size by controlling cell number through stimulation of apoptosis and the inhibition of proliferation (reviewed in REF. 57). A major downstream effector of the Hippo pathway is Yes-associated protein (YAP; also known as Yorkie homologue). YAP is phosphorylated and inhibited by the Hippo pathway kinase large tumour suppressor homologue (LATS). Active, hypophosphorylated YAP translocates into the nucleus to induce and inhibit the transcription of genes encoding proteins that promote proliferation and apoptosis, respectively. Thus, the Hippo pathway inhibits proliferation and activates apoptosis by inhibiting YAP. As cell growth and proliferation must be tightly coordinated, crosstalk between the Hippo and mTOR pathways has long been expected but shown only recently. It was demonstrated that YAP positively controls both mTORC1 and mTORC2 (REF. 58). YAP stimulates transcription of the microRNA miR-29, which inhibits the translation of PTEN (FIG. 1d). The downregulation of PTEN by YAP activates PI3K signalling and thereby both mTORC1 and mTORC2.

Mammary epithelial cells and keratinocytes that overexpress YAP display an increase in cell size, which suggests that the Hippo pathway also controls cell growth. The YAP-mediated increase in cell size was blocked by rapamycin, indicating that YAP promotes cell growth through mTORC1. It had previously been demonstrated that transgenic mice overexpressing YAP specifically in the liver show markedly increased liver mass⁵⁹. However, hepatocytes from the YAP transgenic mice were smaller and more densely packed compared to those in control cells. Therefore, regulation of cell size by Hippo and mTOR may be cell type specific.

Recently, two groups independently demonstrated that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) inhibit the Hippo pathway and activate YAP⁶⁰,⁶¹. Consistent with this observation, thrombin, a ligand for the GPCR protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1), activates YAP and downregulates PTEN expression⁵⁸. GPCR signalling also strongly activates PI3K through direct interaction of the GPCR subunits Gβγ with PI3Ky (reviewed in REF. 62). Given the prominent role of mTOR in metabolism, it would be of interest to explore how GPCR and Hippo signalling may control metabolism through mTOR.

The canonical WNT signalling pathway is activated through binding of the WNT ligand to the cell surface receptor Frizzled and the co-receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (LRP5) or LRP6. The activated receptor in turn leads to the release of glycogen synthase kinase 3β (GSK3β) from the intracellular adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-Axin complex, inhibition of the GSK3β-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin and thereby stabilization of the transcription co-activator β-catenin. Stabilized β-catenin translocates into the nucleus and promotes the expression of genes involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, polarity and migration (reviewed in REF. 63). WNT signalling was shown to promote mTORC1 activity by preventing induction of the TSC complex⁶⁴ (FIG. 1e). In the absence of WNT signalling, GSK3β phosphorylates TSC2 at Ser1379 and Ser1383 in a manner dependent on the AMPK-mediated phosphorylation of TSC2 at Ser1387. These phosphorylation events activate the TSC complex and thereby inhibit mTORC1. Although the above study was carried out in cultured cells, a recent study using zebrafish and mice also demonstrated that WNT and Frizzled activate mTORC1 through loss of APC and inhibition of GSK3β⁶⁵.

WNT3A activates mTORC2 (REF. 66). WNT3A-induced activation of mTORC2 promotes glycolysis and osteoblast differentiation by increasing the expression of key glycolytic enzymes. Moreover, WNT3A-mediated mTORC2 activation requires the LRP5 co-receptor, but not the canonical WNT signalling molecules GSK3β and β-catenin. Furthermore, knockdown of the small G protein RAC1 impairs WNT3A-mediated activation of mTORC2 and glycolysis⁶⁶. This study highlights mTORC2 as a downstream target of non-canonical WNT signalling and suggests that mTORC2 might have an important physiological role in osteoblast differentiation and, presumably, bone formation. Although WNT3A can stimulate glucose consumption in various cell types, it remains to be determined whether WNT-mediated activation of mTORC2 is specific to bone marrow stromal cells.

Notch signalling is involved in the control of proliferation, differentiation and development (reviewed in REF. 67). Binding of cell surface-tethered ligands (Delta and Jagged) to Notch receptors on neighbouring cells initiates a series of cleavages in the Notch receptor. The final cleavage releases the Notch intracellular domain (NICD). NICD translocates into the nucleus and acts
as a transcriptional co-activator that promotes gene expression. Notch signalling has been shown to promote hepatic lipogenesis through activation of mTORC1 (REF. 68). Hyperactivation of Notch signalling increases RAPTOR protein expression, without affecting RPTOR mRNA levels, in rat hepatoma cells and primary mouse hepatocytes. Hyperactivation of Notch signalling also promotes mTOR–RAPTOR interactions. Hence, Notch signalling seems to promote mTORC1 signalling by increasing the levels of a core component of mTORC1, as well as mTORC1 assembly. More studies are required to elucidate the mechanism by which hyperactivation of Notch signalling increased RAPTOR expression and mTOR–RAPTOR interaction.

### Conclusions and perspectives

Recent mTOR omics studies, including ribosome profiling, phosphoproteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, have provided new insight into mTOR signalling. However, the large databases generated by these approaches have yet to be fully exploited. Further mining of the data will probably produce more valuable information. Moreover, the combined analysis of multiple mTOR omics data sets could provide additional insight into the biological processes that are regulated by mTOR. For example, mTOR ribosome profiling¹⁴ and metabolomics²⁰ identified genes and metabolites related to mitochondrial function. Indeed, it was very recently demonstrated that mTORC1 stimulates mitochondrial activity through the translational regulation of nucleus-encoded mitochondria-related mRNAs⁶⁹. Both ribosome profiling¹³,¹⁴ and phosphoproteomics¹⁶⁻¹⁸ suggest that mTOR controls RNA processing, although this remains to be confirmed. In addition, much remains to be determined with regard to the molecular mechanisms through which mTOR impinges on its many downstream processes. It is of particular interest to distinguish direct mTOR substrates from downstream effectors. Follow-up studies are needed to connect mTOR-regulated proteins to specific processes. Finally, the mTOR omics studies carried out to date have been in cell-based systems. As mTOR signalling is frequently deregulated in metabolic disorders and cancers, it would be of particular interest to conduct omics studies using in vivo models, such as tissue-specific *Raptor*-, *Rictor*- and *Pten*-knockout mice, and eventually human samples in which the mTOR pathway is deregulated. This could provide a molecular link between mTOR deregulation and disease development.

With regard to crosstalk with other pathways, Hippo, WNT and Notch signalling have so far been identified as upstream regulators of mTOR signalling mostly in cell-based studies. Additional studies are required to determine the physiological importance and cellular location⁷⁰ of these new connections and whether they are widespread in nature. Characterization of mTOR signalling in mice in which Hippo, WNT and Notch signalling are genetically modified may provide further insights into the functional interactions between these pathways and mTOR. Finally, as growth, proliferation and differentiation have to be controlled in a coordinated manner, it is likely that mTOR interacts with other pathways and in more important ways than so far shown. For example, a recent mTOR chromatin immunoprecipitation–sequencing study revealed that mTOR crosstalks with oestrogen receptor-like 1 (EER1) to control the expression of genes involved in the TCA cycle and lipid biosynthesis⁷¹.
