**Glycosyltransferases: managers of small molecules**

Dianna Bowles, Judith Isayenкова, Eng-Kiat Lim and Brigitte Poppenberger

Studies of the glycosyltransferases (GTs) of small molecules have greatly increased in recent years as new approaches have been used to identify their genes and characterize their catalytic activities. These enzymes recognize diverse acceptors, including plant metabolites, phytotoxins and xenobiotics. Glycosylation alters the hydrophilicity of the acceptors, their stability and chemical properties, their subcellular localisation and often their bioactivity. Considerable progress has been made in understanding the role of GTs in the plant and the utility of GTs as biocatalysts, the latter arising from their regio- and enantioselectivity and their ability to recognize substrates that are not limited to plant metabolites.

plants. The Family 1 GTs have been reviewed recently [1,2,3]. This article focuses on a selection of GTs that have led to major advances in our understanding in three principal areas: substrate recognition, utility and structure–activity relatedness.

### Strategies to identify GTs

Since 2003, several approaches have been used to identify and analyse genes that encode plant GTs. These include sequence-based homology searches that use the consensus sequence to identify expressed sequence tags (ESTs), cDNAs or genes, followed by *in vitro* expression and substrate-specificity analysis of their recombinant proteins [4,5,6,7]. Degenerate primers have been used to isolate GTs that have homology to characterised enzymes from other plant species [8], and classical biochemical purification has also been used to determine an enzyme activity and to clone the corresponding gene [9,10]. In addition to these targeted methods, unbiased screens for the suppression of a particular phenotype in mutagenised plants [11], or involving the functional expression of an *Arabidopsis* cDNA library in yeast to identify genes that are involved in a specific detoxification process [12], have also identified GTs.

A major opportunity has arisen through the identification of all of the GTs containing the consensus sequence in the *Arabidopsis* genome [13]. These sequences, when expressed as recombinant proteins, can be screened for any acceptor that is known to be glycosylated. This provides, for the first time, a means to compare catalytic activities *in vitro* across an entire multigene family and, hence, a way to investigate sequence relatedness and substrate recognition [14]. Thus, we now know that compounds that are recognized by *Arabidopsis* GTs *in vitro* include auxins, salicylic acid, cytokinins, phenylpropanoids, flavonoids [3] and trichlorinated phenol [15].

### Biological roles of GTs

Although these *in vitro* studies can provide some indications of potential GT activities *in planta*, it has become clear that *in vitro* substrate specificity does not necessarily reflect the catalytic function and cannot reflect the physiological role(s) of the enzyme. In this context, several publications in the period under review have directly addressed the role of GTs in the plant and these will now be discussed in detail.

The work of Grubb *et al.* [6] identified the *Arabidopsis* orthologue (UGT74B1) of a *Brassica napus* GT [16] and

confirmed that recombinant UGT74B1 catalysed the glucosylation of a thiohydroximate substrate *in vitro*. The levels of two glucosinolates were decreased by 50% in a loss-of-function mutant (*ugt74b1*). In addition to changes in chemotype, the morphological phenotype of the mutant was also altered. Some of its features resembled a disturbance in auxin metabolism previously described for other glucosinolate mutants. Also, the toxicity of higher levels of thiohydroximate substrate that are presumed to occur in the GT-deficient mutant led to chlorosis. This study provides an excellent example of a strategy in which the identification of a potentially interesting orthologue is confirmed first by *in vitro* characterisation of activity and second by analysis of the chemotypic or phenotypic impact of knocking out the gene in the plant.

The characterisation of the tobacco glucosyltransferases (TOGTs) is another example of how the *in planta* roles of GTs can be verified using a complementary set of approaches. TOGT genes had been shown to be upregulated by salicylic acid (SA) [17] and during the hypersensitive response [18]. The genes had also been shown to encode GTs that accept hydroxycinnamates and hydroxycoumarins, particularly scopoletin, as substrates *in vitro* [18]. Chong *et al.* [19] chose an antisense strategy to downregulate TOGT genes and determined the effect of this downregulation on the course of tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) infection. Profiling showed that following challenge by the virus both the substrate, scopoletin, and the product, scopolin, of TOGT were reduced to 75% of wildtype levels in these antisense lines. This reduction was correlated with a phenotype in which the blue fluorescence visualized by UV light in living cells, surrounding the TMV lesions, was massively reduced. Lesion size was increased in the antisense lines and the amount of TMV in the lesions was also increased. Thus, by downregulating TOGT, the plants became more susceptible to virus infection.

The effect of overexpressing TOGT on virus infection has, however, given two contrasting results in very similar studies [20,21]. Gachon *et al.* [20] observed the expected accumulation of both the scopoletin aglycone and its glucoside in the transgenic lines after infection with TMV, and found no difference in viral content between wildtype and transgenic plants using a TMV-specific antibody. By contrast, when Matros and Mock [21] analysed transgenic lines that were constructed in an identical way, they also observed identical changes in scopoletin and scopolin but a decrease in potato virus Y coat protein, suggesting that the transgenic lines had increased resistance.

A novel role of GTs in plant–fungal interactions has been implied by a recent study in which a gene that is involved in resistance against deoxynivalenol (DON), a mycotoxin produced by pathogenic fungi of the genus *Fusarium*, was

identified. These mycotoxins are a major health hazard if present in food or feed products that contain cereals. A screen of an *Arabidopsis* cDNA library that was functionally expressed in yeast demonstrated that UGT73C5 conferred resistance of the yeast cells to DON. This GT was shown to catalyse the transfer of glucose to the C3-OH position of DON and, when overexpressed in the plant, conferred enhanced tolerance to the mycotoxin [12**]. Thus, this is an example of the plant's inactivating the toxins of an invading pathogen. It contrasts with the work of Bouarab *et al.* [22] on the detoxification of saponins by *Septoria lycopersici*, which is an example of the invading pathogen’s inactivation of the plant defence system.

In addition to detoxification of biotic toxins, GTs have also been implicated in detoxification of xenobiotics, including herbicides, pesticides and pollutants. As yet, however, the evidence relies on *in vitro* activities. For example, Loutre *et al.* [10*] reported the purification of UGT72B1 from *Arabidopsis* roots, which was found to catalyse *in vitro* both the O- and N-glycosylation of chlorinated phenols and anilines, such as 3,4-dinitroaniline. The same sequence, expressed as a recombinant protein, had previously been shown to catalyse the glucosylation of 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid [23]. These types of studies raise the interesting possibility that the same GTs might recognize both endogenous and exogenous substrates, and might play a role in primary and secondary metabolism and detoxification. The *in vitro* study of Messner *et al.* [15*] also supports this possibility. Their data showed that *Arabidopsis* GTs that recognised endogenous substrates such as auxins and phenylpropanoids also exhibited activity towards 2,4,5-trichlorophenol. Most interestingly, the presence of this xenobiotic interfered with the GT’s activity towards endogenous plant metabolites.

The glycosylation of flavonoids was addressed by Jones *et al.* [24*] who used T-DNA knockout lines to link the absence of GTs with the absence of particular glycosides. The *in vitro* activity of the GTs confirmed the profiling results. Thus, UGT78D1 was found to transfer rhamnose from uridine diphosphate-rhamnose (UDP-Rha) to the 3-OH position of the two flavonoids quercetin and kaempferol, and UGT73C6 was found to transfer glucose from UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc) to the 7-OH position of those glycosides. UGT78D1 represents the first identified example of an *Arabidopsis* GT that uses UDP-Rha as sugar donor. It is highly probable that many more *Arabidopsis* GTs will have this specificity, given the number and diversity of rhamnosylated secondary metabolites in this and other plant species. Until UDP-Rha is commercially available, progress in their identification is likely to be slow.

The *in vitro* studies of Jones *et al.* [24*] described above showed that substrate recognition by the GTs was broader than that predicted from a comparison of wild-

type and knockout metabolite profiles. This is likely, given the very different contexts for enzyme action. *In planta*, the availability and concentration of substrates, as well as the potential presence of competing GT activities, will influence product formation. This, in turn, will also be affected if GT levels are changed through developmental and environmental regulation. In addition, the potential impact of xenobiotics on the activities of GTs towards endogenous substrates must be considered.

### Utility of glycosyltransferases *in vivo* and *in vitro*

GT activities towards endogenous metabolites and xenobiotics can, in principle, provide the basis for metabolic engineering applications. To date, the literature contains few examples that have exploited this potential. Such examples include the engineering of the cyanogenic glucoside pathway into *Arabidopsis* [25] and the identification of the GT that is involved in sinapine metabolism in *Brassica* [26]. However, the diversity of substrates recognized by GTs *in vivo* and *in vitro*, and their regio- and enantioselectivity, suggest that they have considerable potential utility as biocatalysts for biotransformations. These biotransformations might be carried out using purified enzymes or in fermenter applications using whole-cell biocatalysis systems. There has been substantial progress in identifying GTs that have activity towards plant secondary metabolites and towards synthetic compounds that are relevant to the chemical, pharmaceutical, nutraceutical and agricultural sectors.

Modification of flower colour and pattern has been a biotechnological aim for many years. Fukuchi-Mizutani *et al.* [27] reported the first biochemical and molecular characterisation of a novel anthocyanin 3′-O-glucosyltransferase from *Gentiana triflora* petals that is considered to be causally involved in the formation of the stable, blue anthocyanin gentiodelphin (Figure 1a). This provides an important new foundation for genetically engineering pigmentation in a variety of flower species. In the context of floral colour, interestingly, the first plant glucuronosyltransferase has recently been identified in connection with the glycosylation of cyanidin 3-O-glucosides [28], which are responsible for red pigmentation (Figure 1b).

Glycosylation is involved in the stabilization of volatile terpenoids and phenolics, many of which are associated with flavour. Significantly, glycosylation also plays a role in the perception of flavour, particularly in relation to bitterness and sweetness. Fruit flavour in *Citrus* species is affected by the accumulation of flavanones that have well-recognized nutraceutical properties. In the bitter *Citrus* species, such as grapefruit, regiospecific rhamnosylation of the 2-OH group of the glucose moiety of the naringenin 7-O-glucoside determines the bitter quality of the fruit (Figure 1c). In non-bitter *Citrus* species, such as mandarin, the same substrate is glycosylated but the rhamnose is attached to the 6-OH of the glucose moiety and the product is tasteless. These properties have been recognized for many years but Frydman *et al.* [9] were the first to purify the enzyme responsible for the 2-OH glycosylation, clone the gene and confirm its activity using heterologous expression in a transgenic tobacco cell culture. These results complement earlier studies on limonoid glycosylation, which is responsible for the so-called delayed bitterness of both bitter and non-bitter species [29].

The extent of glycosylation and its regioselectivity is known to influence the organoleptic properties of a compound [30]. This has been confirmed by Richman *et al.* [5] in studies of the Sweet Honey Leaf, *Stevia rebaudiana*. This species is of commercial interest as a natural, low-calorie sweetener, as a 1% *Stevia* leaf extract in water has equivalent sweetness to a 20% sucrose solution [31]. *Stevia* accumulates a mixture of different diterpenoid glycosides, in which the triglucoside stevioside and the tetraglucoside rebaudioside A are the most abundant. An EST approach enabled Richman *et al.* [5] to identify and clone three regioselective glucosyltransferases UGT74G1, UGT76G1 and UGT85C2 from *Stevia* leaves, to analyse the *in vitro* activities of the recombinant enzymes and to propose a biosynthetic pathway for rebaudioside A (Figure 1d).

The carotenoid-derived metabolites that are involved in pigmentation and aroma are another group of commercially attractive targets. In this context, saffron, the dried stigmas of *Crocus sativus*, contains three major apocarotenoids that are responsible for colour, bitter taste and nutraceutical properties [32]. The final biosynthetic steps in crocin formation include glucosylation of the insoluble aglycone crocetin (Figure 1e), which enhances stability and water-solubility and might therefore improve bioavailability. The recent cloning of a GT gene *UGTCs2* from the stigmas of *Crocus sativus* is the first report of a terpenoid GT and provides the basis for an alternative crocin production [8].

(Figure 1 Legend Continued) Examples of plant Family 1 GTs that produce glycosides with distinct chemical properties. (a) In *Gentiana triflora*, a 3′GT is found to transfer glucose onto the 3′-hydroxyl group of delphinidin-3,5-di-O-glucoside [27], resulting in the formation of the blue pigment delphinidin-3,5,3′-tri-O-glucoside. (b) Cyanidin-3-O-(6′-O-malonyl-2′-O-glucuronyl)-glucoside is a major red pigment in *Bellis* flowers. The glucuronosyl group, which is transferred by the enzyme BpUGAT [28], enhances the stability of the molecule. (c) Naringenin-7-O-neohesperidoside is synthesized by 1,2RhaT in *Citrus* [9]. In contrast to its tasteless 7-O-rutinoside isomer, this glycoside has a bitter taste. (d) Rebaudioside A is one of the sweet glycosides that accumulates in *Stevia* leaves. It is also an end-product in steviol metabolism. With the exception of the GT that forms the (1→2)-glucosyl linkage, the enzymes that are involved in transferring the other three sugars have been characterised *in vitro* [5]. (e) Crocetin polyglycosides, possibly formed by UGTCs2 [8], represent the soluble storage forms of crocetin in *Crocus sativus*. These glycosides are responsible for the red pigmentation in the stigmas of this species.
There has been a growing realization in recent years that plant GTs have considerable potential as biocatalysts. The first publication in this field, by Arend *et al.* [33], described a study in which a plant GT was used in a microbial fermentation system. This research has been extended by two recent studies, those by Willits *et al.* [34**] and Lim *et al.* [35]. Willits *et al.* [34**] demonstrated, for the first time, the utility of a combinatorial whole-cell biocatalysis system in which different methyltransferases and glucosyltransferases produced poly-methylated quercetin glucosides. Lim *et al.* [35] used a range of *Arabidopsis* GTs to glucosylate quercetin region-selectively. They went on to demonstrate that the recombinant GTs could be used in a whole-cell biocatalysis system, even at fermenter-scale, to produce quercetin mono- and diglucosides. As the substrate recognition of plant GTs is not limited to plant metabolites, their potential application as biocatalysts could be very considerable. Enantioselectivity is an important feature of substrate recognition. Many natural metabolites can exist in different stereo-isomers that have distinct chemical and physical properties. As yet, the enantioselectivity of Family 1 GTs has not been explored in detail. However, an *Arabidopsis* recombinant GT has been found that specifically conjugates the natural abscisic acid (+)-ABA and has been used in whole-cell biocatalysis to purify (+)-ABA from a mixture of ABA enantiomers [36*].

The use of endogenous GTs in plant cell cultures has great potential for metabolic engineering. For example, when applied to suspension cultures of *Catharanthus roseus*, curcumin (a food colourant and potential nutraceutical) is converted to a series of non-natural glucosides, enhancing its water solubility by \(2 \times 10^7\) [37]. This provided the basis for identifying a *Catharanthus* GT that has high *in vitro* activity towards curcumin and thereby a means for producing large quantities of curcumin diglucoside [38].

### Biomolecular studies

At the time of writing, 77 GT families have been identified and described in the CAZy (carbohydrate active enzyme [http://afmb.cnrs-mrs.fr/CAZY/]) database. The GTs in Family 1 constitute the largest group in the fully sequenced genomes of rice and *Arabidopsis*. The crystal structures of 17 GT proteins from different families have been solved (CAZy database). These structures are classified into two GT folds, termed GT-A and GT-B, as illustrated and described in Figure 2. To date, no plant Family 1 GT has been crystallized. However, an *Amycolatopsis orientalis* vancomycin GT from Family 1 was crystallized and its structure solved [39]. This protein exhibits the typical GT-B-fold structure, containing two Rossmann-fold-like domains that are linked by a deep cleft (Figure 2). There is low sequence homology between the plant GTs and the vancomycin GT, but their predicted secondary structures are surprisingly similar [3*]. These

Representative illustrations of GT folds. Two structural groups, (a) GT-A and (b) GT-B, have been identified from analyses of the GT crystal structures from different families [39,45,46]. The GT-A fold consists of a single domain in which parallel β-strands are flanked on either side by α-helices. By contrast, the GT-B fold contains two Rossmann-fold-like domains that are separated by a deep cleft.

similarities are also reflected in a recent molecular modelling analysis [40**].

As already described, a 44-amino acid consensus in the carboxy-terminal domain of Family 1 GTs defines a subset of the enzymes found throughout prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. With the exception of three enzymes, all of the *Arabidopsis* Family 1 GTs contain this consensus [41]. Photoaffinity-labelling of the subset of Family 1 GTs found in human cells has confirmed that residues in the consensus sequence interact with UDP, whereas the amino-terminal domain is suggested to interact with the acceptor [3*].

Several different UDP-sugars have been reported to be donors for the subset of plant Family 1 GTs that

contain the consensus sequence. Examples that have been published in the past two years include UDP-Glc [5°], UDP-Rha [9°], UDP-galactose (UDP-Gal) [42°], UDP-glucuronic acid (UDP-GlcUA) [28°] and UDP-xylose (UDP-Xyl) [43]. A key question is how the sugar selectivity is determined. In the absence of crystal structures, the issue can only be addressed through protein engineering and molecular modelling. Thus, in the study

of Aralia ACGaT, when residue histidine 374 was mutated to glutamine, the preferred donor was switched from UDP-Gal to UDP-Glc [42°], suggesting that residue 374 might interact with the 4-OH of the hexose. These studies on plant GTs are only just beginning, but an analysis in which a mutated T4 phage BGT (Family 63, GT-B fold) co-crystallised with the sugar donor [44°] elegantly illustrated how the amino acids located in the

An updated phylogenetic tree of the plant Family 1 GTs described in this review (accession numbers are listed in Table 1). The analysis, which includes the 107 Arabidopsis sequences and 22 sequences identified since 2003 from other plant species, was carried out using the software package Phylip-3.63. The distance analyses were done by the ProtDist programme and the trees were calculated by the neighbour-joining method. The phylogenetic clusters supported by bootstrap values >90% are colour-coded and labelled on the basis of the previous study of Arabidopsis sequences [13]. The four cytokinin GTs from Zea and Phaseolus form a distinct phylogenetic cluster that does not contain any Arabidopsis sequences. The representative Arabidopsis sequences are shown in black and the GTs from other plant species are shown in grey.

amino- and carboxy-terminal domains of this GT interacted with the glucosyl moiety of UDP-Glc.

**The phylogeny of plant Family GTs**

The first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of an entire GT family from a single plant species was carried out using the *Arabidopsis* Family 1 sequences [13,41]. The *Arabidopsis* GTs were grouped into 14 phylogenetic clusters, each strongly supported by bootstrap analysis. When GTs from other plant species were integrated into the *Arabidopsis* analysis, all were grouped into the same clusters with the exception of four cytokinin GTs from *Phaseolus* and *Zea*, which formed a distinct cluster separate from those *Arabidopsis* GTs that recognise cytokinins [7].

Lim et al. [14**] used a model substrate to investigate the relationship between sequence homology and substrate recognition across the entire GT family of *Arabidopsis*. Forty-eight enzymes recognized esculetin but the regios-electivity of glycosylation varied amongst phylogenetic clusters. There was clear evidence that regioselectivity-switching events have occurred during GT evolution.

Figure 3 provides an updated phylogenetic analysis that incorporates all of the GT sequences discussed in this review. Interestingly, sequences for the *Bellis* BpUGAT and *Citrus* Cm1,2RhaT, both of which form di-glycosides (Figure 1b,c) are found in a single cluster (Cluster A). No *in vitro* activities have been reported to date for any of the GTs in this cluster. It is possible that the acceptors

UGTs with identified substrate specificities that have been published recently were included in the table and used to construct the phylogenetic tree (Figure 3).
required for recognition by the Cluster A GTs are mono-
glycosides, and this is a readily testable prediction from
the updated analysis.

### Conclusions

We consider that there are three areas of study that will
lead to major advances in the immediate future: first,
genetic analyses to determine GT function *in planta*;
second, exploration of the diversity of substrates recog-
nized by GT biocatalysts; and third, solution of the first
plant Family 1 GT protein crystal structure.

   This review focuses on work on plant Family 1 GTs from 2001 to early
   2003. A comparison of the secondary structure of the bacterial enzyme
   GtfA with the predicted secondary structures of a human GT and a plant
   GT indicates a surprising similarity between the three GTs at this level;
   this, despite their very low amino-acid sequence homology.

   The utility of ESTs as a means of gene discovery was demonstrated by
   identifying three of four enzymes that are involved in glucosylation of the
   aglycone steviol in *Stevia rebaudiana*. In vitro analyses revealed regio-
   selective glucosylation of steviol by the GTs.

   Thioglycosylate substrates are shown to be recognized by the recom-
   binant UGT74B1 in vitro. *Arabidopsis* mutants that lack the function of this
   GT showed decreased glucosinolate levels and morphological pheno-
   types that were consistent with thioglycosylate toxicity and IAA over-
   production.

   The authors report the first cloning of a terpenoid GT, the saffron
   apocarotenoid crocetin UGT from *Crocus sativus*, which is highly
   expressed in stigma of crocin-accumulating species. The recombinant
   enzyme provides a tool for the alternative production of crocin in hetero-
   logous systems.

   *Plant J* 2004, **40**:88-100.
   A GT from pummelo was identified and found to catalyse the key flavour-
   determining step of citrus flavanone-glycoside biosynthesis: the formation
   of the bitter-tasting flavanone-7-O-neohesperidosides. The gene was
   isolated using a classic biochemical approach and functionally charac-
   terised by heterologous expression in tobacco cell suspension culture.

    *Arabidopsis* UGT74F2 glucosyltransferase is required for
    tryptophan mutant blue fluorescence. *J Biol Chem* 2003,
    **278**:6275-6281.
    Loss-of-function UGT74F2 alleles were isolated in a genetic screen as
    suppressors of blue fluorescence in the *Arabidopsis trp1-100* mutant,
    which has a defect in tryptophan biosynthesis and accumulates high
    levels of fluorescent anthranilate–glucose conjugate. *In vitro* analysis
    confirmed the regioselective glucosylation of anthranilate, a benzoate
    that is structurally similar to salicylic acid, which had previously also been
    shown to be glucosylated by UGT74F2.

    deoxynivalenol by a UDP-glucosyltransferase from
    *Arabidopsis thaliana*. *J Biol Chem* 2003, **278**:47905-47914.
    An *Arabidopsis* cDNA library was functionally expressed in yeast and
    screened for candidates that confer resistance to the *Fusarium* mycotoxin
    deoxynivalenol. UGT73C5 was isolated using this approach and shown to
    detoxify deoxynivalenol by glucosylating the C3-OH position of the
    mycotoxin, leading to its biological inactivation. Plants that overex-
    pressed the UGT exhibited increased mycotoxin tolerance.

    **13**:139-145.
    The hydroxycoumarin esculetin was used as a model substrate to analyse
    the relatedness of sequence similarity and substrate recognition across
    the entire multigene family of Family 1 GTs. Regioselective glucosylation
    at the 6-OH or 7-OH positions of esculetin varied across phylogenetic
    clusters, suggesting that regioselective switching events had occurred
    during evolution.

    genous and xenobiotic substrates. The authors observed competition
    between the different substrates analysed.
