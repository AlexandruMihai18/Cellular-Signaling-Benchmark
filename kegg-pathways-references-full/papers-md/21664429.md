## ABSTRACT

Prolactin is a hormone that is essential for normal reproduction and signals through two types of receptors. Not only is the classical long form of the prolactin receptor identified, but so are many short form receptors in rodents and human tissues. Mouse mutagenesis studies have offered insight into the biology of prolactin family, providing compelling evidence that the different isoforms have independent biological activity. The possibility that short forms mediate cell proliferation is important for a variety of tissues including mammary gland and ovarian follicles. This review summarizes our current knowledge about prolactin signaling and its role in reproduction through either long or short isoform receptors.

there have been attempts to rationalize the reason why a single hormone might exert such a range of diverse and seemingly unrelated endocrine functions.

## 2. Synthesis and control of prolactin secretion

PRL is predominantly produced by the lactotrophic cells of the anterior pituitary gland. However, it is also generated in extra-pituitary sites such as immune, decidual, mammary, epithelial and fat cells (Ben-Jonathan et al., 1996; Hugo et al., 2006; Prigent-Tessier et al., 1999). Its secretion is under dual regulation by hypothalamic hormones via the pituitary portal circulation (Freeman et al., 2000; Grattan and Kokay, 2008). The predominant regulatory signal is the inhibition of prolactin secretion by the neurotransmitter, dopamine, from neurons in the hypothalamus. Evidence suggests that prolactin secretion is regulated by three populations of hypothalamic dopaminergic systems (Demaria et al., 1999): the tuberoinfundibular, tuberohypophyseal, and periventricular hypophysial dopaminergic neurons. The stimulatory signal for prolactin secretion can be mediated by other factors including thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH). Chronic increases in 17β-estradiol also stimulate prolactin secretion, both through actions on the pituitary gland and through hypothalamic mechanisms (Palm et al., 2001).

## 3. PRLR isoforms

Biological effects of prolactin are mediated by its interaction with PRL receptor (PRLR), a member of the cytokine receptor superfamily (Bole-Feysot et al., 1998; Clevenger et al., 2003). PRLRs are present in nearly all organs and tissues. While the *PRLR* gene is unique in each species, alternative splicing generates its different isoforms which are identical in their extracellular domains but differ in the lengths and sequences of their intracellular domains (Bole-Feysot et al., 1998; Davis and Linzer, 1989; Hu et al., 2001; Kline et al., 1999; Trott et al., 2004). As for the protein, the long-PRLR isoform (long-R) and several short-PRLR isoforms (short-R) have been detected. The PRLR exists as seven recognized isoforms in human, four in mouse (but only two short forms have been identified as proteins) and three in rat; all of these isoforms exhibit different signaling properties (Fig. 1). For example, their ligand binding domains, transmembrane regions, and 44 amino acids of their cytoplasmic domains are identical in rats. Their difference relies in a unique intracellular sequence composed of 57 amino acids in the short-R and of 358 amino acids in the long-R (Goffin et al., 2002). The expression of the diverse isoforms has been shown to vary during development and as a function of the stage of the estrous cycle, pregnancy, and lactation in rodents (Nagano and Kelly, 1994). The long isoform is highly expressed in the ovary, adrenal, kidney, mammary gland, small intestine, choroid plexus and pancreas, while other organs, i.e., the liver, also express high levels of short isoform. The co-expression of both receptor isoforms is important for the normal physiological development of the ovarian follicles. Indeed, long-R is expressed at much higher levels than short-R in the growing follicles (Russell and Richards, 1999) and this may prevent signaling through short-R. However, because of the extremely broad distribution of PRLR, it is currently difficult to propose a general overview of its regulation of expression (Bole-Feysot et al., 1998).

## 4. PRLR: Binding, dimerization and degradation

The hormone PRL in its tertiary structure is composed of a bundle of four antiparallel α-helices (Kossiakoff, 2004) and utilizes a conserved, single pass transmembrane receptor classified as cytokine type 1 receptor.

PRLRs are composed of an extracellular domain required for ligand binding, a single transmembrane region, and an intracellular domain containing a region of membrane-proximal homology to other cytokine receptors. The human PRLR binding interface contains four histidines whose protonation is hypothesized to regulate pH-dependent receptor recognition. Thermodynamic modeling of the pH dependence to receptor binding affinity reveals large changes in site-specific protonation constants for a majority of interface histidines upon complexation (Kulkarni et al., 2010). The cytoplasmic domain of cytokine receptors displays a more restricted sequence similarity than the extracellular domain. Two regions, called box 1 and box 2 are conserved. Box 1 is a membrane-proximal region composed of 8 aa highly enriched in prolines and hydrophobic residues and is assumed to adopt the consensus folding specifically recognized by transducing molecules. The second consensus region, box 2, is much less conserved than box 1 and consists in the succession of hydrophobic, negatively charged,

Fig. 1. Schema of the PRLR proteins in mouse and human. The PRLR protein consists of an extracellular domain (ECD) and a transmembrane domain that are identical within species, as well as a cytoplasmic domain of variable length and composition. The common features such as a disulfide bond (green), WS motif (blue), as well as Box 1 (yellow) are conserved. A soluble PRLR binding protein (PRLBP) contains only the ECD. In the intracellular domain, are represented the positions of all known tyrosine residues which are the phosphorylation substrates.
and then positively charged residues. While box 1 is conserved in all membrane PRLR isoforms, box 2 is not found in short isoforms.

The initial event in PRL signaling is the binding of one prolactin molecule to two cell-surface receptor monomers, leading to their dimerization and subsequent activation. This model was based on studies with growth hormone receptor (GHR), but very recent studies revealed that predimerization of GHR occurs *in vivo* in the absence of ligand ([Brown et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M503869200)), subsequently the ligand activates a preformed dimer by inducing rotational torque through the transmembrane domain. Discordant studies from independent laboratories have looked at PRLR dimerization, in the past: one study demonstrated that recombinant soluble PRLR-extracellular domain does not predimerize but rather form an unstable homodimer upon PRL binding ([Gertler et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.271.25.15059)). In addition, full length PRLR failed to show Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) in absence of ligand ([Biener et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M301871200)) whereas another study demonstrated a lack of Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) signal between homodimers and heterodimers of long-R and two short-R in the absence of ligand ([Tan et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M502363200)). Nevertheless, it has been reported that homo- and heterodimers of human PRLR are constitutively present, and that the hormone acts on the preformed long form homodimer to induce the active signal transduction configuration ([Qazi et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M511888200)). These results could be partly explained by differences in both the nature of the constructs and the sensitivity of the BRET/FRET approaches ([Qazi et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M511888200); [Tan et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M502363200)). Using biochemical techniques, ligand-independent dimerization of transfected and endogenous PRLR ([Gadd and Clevenger, 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M511888200)) has been demonstrated. Taken together, all these data corroborate ligand-independent dimerization of cytokine receptors, the addition of ligand seems to bind a preformed dimer and initiate conformational changes leading to activation of receptor. Now, the unsolved question remains to decipher what enables the receptor to modify its conformation after ligand binding to activate the Janus kinases.

Heterodimerization of different PRLR isoforms produces inactive complexes which might also be of importance in the physiological context because PRL target cells usually express more than a single PRLR isoform. It is of note that long-R/short-R heterodimerization of the human receptors has also been demonstrated and the co-expression of the short-R (SF1b form) decreases the amount of long-R mRNA by accelerating long-R mRNA degradation ([Tan and Walker, 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2010.02.003)).

In contrast to GHR homodimers in response to GH, covalently linked PRLR have not been observed. The issue of GHR-PRLR heterodimerization has been only minimally explored. Previous reconstitution experiments suggest that ovine GHR and PRLR can heterodimerize in response to placental lactogens ([Biener et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M301871200); [Herman et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M003878200)). Furthermore, it has been suggested that the human receptors may also dimerize ([Langenheim and Chen, 2009](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M109.005857)), and recent immunoprecipitation studies revealed specific GHR-PRLR association in human breast cancer cells that was enhanced by GH treatment. GH signaling in these cells is largely mediated by the PRLR in the context of both homo- and heterodimers broadening our understanding of how GH and PRL and their related receptors may function in physiology and pathology ([Xu et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M110.197389)).

Ubiquitination and degradation of PRLR is mainly mediated by the β-transducin-repeat-containing protein (β-TrCP) E3 ubiquitin ligase that is recruited to PRLR in a manner that requires phosphorylation of Ser349 of the receptor ([Li et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M402876200)). Signaling induced by PRL and mediated by catalytic activation of Janus kinase 2 (Jak2) stimulates this Ser349 phosphorylation in addition to ubiquitination, initial internalization, and degradation of PRLR ([Swaminathan et al., 2008b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M802876200)). These data are in line with the hypothesis that ligand stimulated PRLR ubiquitination leads to PRLR internalization, sorting to the lysosomes, and lysosomal degradation. The ubiquitination

mechanisms of PRLR leading to its degradation have been recently elucidated. PRLR is degraded primarily through the lysosomal pathway and efficient clathrin-dependent internalization of PRLR requires both receptor ubiquitination and the function of the assembly polypeptide 2 (AP2) complex. The ubiquitination of PRLR stimulates its interaction with the AP2 complex. Then, polyubiquitination and K63 linkages are required for the internalization, postinternalization sorting, and lysosomal degradation of PRLR ([Varghese et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M802876200)).

### 5. Signaling pathways activated by PRL

PRLR is devoid of intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity but can be phosphorylated by associated proteins. Although the signaling pathway downstream of the long-R has been well characterized, little is known about PRL actions mediated by short-R. Acting through the long isoform, PRL activates many kinases including Janus kinase2 (Jak2) ([Goffin et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202876200)), Src kinase ([Clevenger et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M302876200); [Swaminathan et al., 2008a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M802876200)), Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-kinase) ([Berlanga et al., 1997b](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M702876200)), MAP kinase ([Bole-Feysot et al., 1998](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M802876200)) and serine/threonine kinase Nek3-vav2-Rac1 pathways ([Clevenger, 2004](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M402876200)). Jak2 phosphorylates PRLR on multiple tyrosine sites along the loop and the loop-associated signal transducer and activator of transcription a/b (Stat5a/b) on a conserved tyrosine residue within the C-terminal SH2-dimerization domain. Subsequently, tyrosine-phosphorylated Stat5 dissociates from the receptor, forms a transcriptional active dimer and translocates into the nucleus, where it regulates gene expression. These signaling events induce several PRL-responsive genes such as those involved in cell proliferation (cyclin D1 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing protein (CIS)) and differentiation ([Ali et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M602876200); [Brockman et al., 2002](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M202876200)) ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). Recently, a new member of the PRL signaling cascade was added; PI3kinase enhancer-A (PIKE-A) has been shown to directly associate with both Stat5a and PRLR, which is essential for PRL-provoked Stat5a activation and the subsequent gene transcription ([Chan et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M102876200)). PIKE-A is critical for the activation of Akt signaling its depletion in HC11 epithelial cells diminished PRL-induced Stat5 activation and cyclin D1 expression, resulting in profoundly impaired cell proliferation *in vitro*.

The interaction of the PRLR with the kinases, or with other proteins involved in positive and negative regulation of signaling (adapters, phosphatases, suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS), etc.), has been mapped in identified regions of the cytoplasmic domain. For example, the tyrosine residues in the C-terminal part of the long-R contribute to the engagement and phosphorylation of Stat5 by Jak2 ([Pezet et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M702876200)) ([Fig. 2](#fig2)). Very recently, PRL-activated PRLR and its downstream Stat5b were shown both acetylated by CREB-binding protein (CBP). These results suggest that the acetylation/deacetylation process provides the rheostat-like regulation for PRLR in its cytoplasmic loop dimerization and subsequent Stat activation. Acetylation-dependent cytoplasmic loop dimerization has been shared as a mechanism for activation among type I cytokine receptors that activate Stat ([Ma et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M102876200)).

Most of what we know about PRL receptor signaling comes from analysis of the long-R where the best studied pathway is activation of Jak/Stat. Although it has been suggested that PRLR short isoforms behave either as dominant negatives by inhibiting the function of the long-R ([Berlanga et al., 1997a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M702876200); [Lesueur et al., 1991](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M102876200); [Perrot-Applanat et al., 1997](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M702876200); [Saunier et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M302876200)), or as positive regulators in mammary gland ([Binart et al., 2003a](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M302876200)), the mechanisms by which PRL signals through the short-R remain unclear. In addition, soluble receptor isoforms containing the extracellular domain have only been identified in humans but not in rodents ([Kline and Clevenger, 2001](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M102876200)). The various PRLR isoforms exhibit different signaling properties; for example, the short-R is not

Fig. 2. Major signaling cascades triggered by long and short PRLR isoforms. Ligand-induced activation of the PRLR triggers several signaling cascades. The main pathway involves the tyrosine kinase Jak2, which in turn activates two members of the Stat family, Stat5 a and b. The MAPK and PI3 K pathways are other important cascades activated by the PRLR. They involve the Shc/Grb2/Sos/Ras/Raf intermediaries upstream to MAPK kinases and the kinase Akt, respectively. Activation of other signaling pathways has been reported; among these, Src kinases are known to play an important role in proliferation.

tyrosine-phosphorylated, which prevents this isoform from interacting directly with SH2-containing proteins, such as Stat factors. Recent results have established a role for PRL-RS in PRL activation/deactivation of specific transcription factors. Sp1 is one of the few transcription factors whose DNA binding activity, nuclear localization, and expression is repressed by PRL in vivo and in vitro. These events appear to involve the calmodulin-dependent protein kinase pathway. These data demonstrate that the short-R activates a signaling pathway distinct from that of the long-R (Devi et al., 2009).

### 6. Lessons from PRLR manipulated mice

Lactogenic hormones (Soares et al., 2007) (placental lactogens and prolactin) play a critical role in rodent reproductive function. Among these functions the best established is the key role in maintaining the ovarian corpus luteum (CL) and progesterone production through the long-R since this form is predominantly expressed (Risk and Gibori, 2001; Stocco et al., 2007). Even a number of PRL key functions have been clarified by studies of transgenic and knockout model mice, no long-R knockout model mouse is currently available.

### 7. Ovary and PRLR−/− model

PRL−/− (Horseman et al., 1997) and PRLR−/− (Ormandy et al., 1997) female mice have been described as completely infertile. After mating with fertile males, no litters were produced although each female mated repeatedly at irregular intervals. PRLR−/− ovaries are normal and do not present differences in either follicular development or ovulation and fertilization rate when compared to wild type animals (Grosdemouge et al., 2003). These observations led to the conclusion that PRL is essential for corpus luteum (CL) function (Bachelot and Binart, 2005, 2007; Horseman et al., 1997). Activation of the luteinizing hormone (LH) receptor (LHR) in follicular cells by the preovulatory LH surge causes ovulation and rapidly initiates a program of terminal differentiation of the ovulated follicle into a CL through a process termed luteinization. In rodents, the CL plays a central role in pregnancy maintenance, by synthesizing the steroid progesterone (Stocco et al., 2007). One of the most important changes during luteinization is the alteration in the cellular responsiveness to external signals allowing luteal cells to respond to a new set of hormones, the most important being PRL and LH. Luteinization and CL formation do take place in the absence of PRLR; however, two days after mating, PRLR−/− mice exhibited corpora lutea undergoing regression and displaying strong DNA cleavage associated to low indications of vascularization and absence of sufficient progesterone level to support implantation and subsequent placental development and maintenance (Grosdemo uge et al., 2003). This was due to the absence of down regulation by PRL of 20α-hydroxy steroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD), which is responsible for progesterone catabolism. Since the CL is the main source of progesterone production in rodents, progesterone administration rescues preimplantation embryo development and implantation in PRLR−/− females (Binart et al., 2000). The PRLR is thus a key component regulating ovarian function and governing the regulation of progesterone secretion and, indeed PRL triggers an early signal that induces the survival and steroidogenic capacity of the CL.

During luteinization, there is an alteration in the cellular responsiveness to external signals allowing luteal cells to respond to LH and PRL. The expression of the LHR increases after luteinization and becomes highly abundant in the CL. This up-regulation of LHR during CL formation has been shown to be linked to PRL both in vivo (Gafvels et al., 1992; Segaloff et al., 1990) and in vitro

(Albarracin et al., 1994; Piquette et al., 1991). In rodents, semi-cir- cadian surges of PRL secretion are induced by cervical stimuli, which are believed to be responsible for the conversion of the CL to the corpus luteum of pregnancy leading to increase CL life span and its capacity to secrete sufficient amount of progesterone to maintain pregnancy (Gunnet and Freeman, 1983, 1984). This conversion is thought to involve distinct luteotropic effects of PRL: upregulation of LHR expression as well as progesterone secretion (Gibori and Richards, 1978) and repression of 20αHSD (Albarracin et al., 1994). To determine whether the stimulation of LHR and progesterone production are independent events both mediated by PRL, or whether progesterone production only depends on high expression of LHR and LH stimulation, we studied the luteal expression of LHR and steroidogenesis in PRLR−/− mice treated by hCG. We found out that LH/hCG can stimulate the expression of its cognate receptor in the CL and stimulate the expression of enzymes that are involved in steroidogenesis in the absence of PRL signaling (Bachelot et al., 2009).

Fig. 3. Pathway of galactose metabolism. Classic galactosemia is caused by impairment of GALT leading to an increased accumulation of galactose, Gal-1P, galacticol and galactonate, in cells. GALT is also important for regulating the supply of uridine diphosphate (UDP) sugars that are necessary for post-translational glycosylation of proteins, then its absence leads to glycosylation defects.

Whereas PRL regulation of CL is thought to take place through activation of the long-R, the impact of short-R activation on ovarian development is not at all known. To examine the putative role of the short-R in vivo, we generated PRLR−/− females expressing only the PR-1 short mouse isoform, as referred as PRLR−/−short-R (Halperin et al., 2008).

The number of secondary, pre-antral, and antral follicles is markedly increased in PRLR−/−short-R ovaries, indicating that premature follicular development occurs at a young age in these females. A severe follicular death begins at 4 weeks of age; histological examination shows follicular death where the mural granulosa cells are disorganized and the oocytes devoid of cumulus. From the age of 5 months, the ovaries are almost completely depleted of functional follicles; this likely reflects widespread follicular initiation followed by follicular cell death. PRL signaling through short-R profoundly impacts follicular survival and causes a severe follicular impairment leading to primary ovarian insufficiency (POI) (Halperin et al., 2008). Numerous mutant mouse models have been established for the study of ovarian development (Edson et al., 2009; Jagarlamudi et al., 2010), they have provided clues about what molecules may be involved in the development of POI in humans.

Both PRLR−/− and PRLR−/−short-R females ovulate and form CL during pregnancy, but regression of these CLs is seen within 2.5 days, and pregnancy cannot be sustained (Bachelot et al., 2009). Implantation of progesterone pellets in PRLR−/−short-R females allowed a partial rescue of embryos (Binart et al., 2000; Halperin et al., 2008). Because similar expression of both the long and short isoforms is found in CL (Russell and Richards, 1999; Telleria et al., 1997), a role for short-R on CL was suggested. However, the inability of the short-R to rescue the CL in pregnant PRLR−/−short-R females clearly establishes a key role for long-R in the PRL-maintenance of a functionally progesterone producing CL.

PRL cannot activate Jak2/Stat pathway through the short-R, but does activate other pathways including PI3 kinases pathways. Recent work from JS Richards et al showed that MAPK is essential for normal follicular development (Fan et al., 2009), this pathway is critically inhibited by PRL in reproductive tissues of PRLR-/ PRLR−/−short-R mice (Fig. 2). Thus, the phosphorylation of MAPK downstream targets is also severely inhibited by PRL without affecting immediate upstream kinases, suggesting involvement of MAPK specific phosphatase in this inhibition. A 27 kDa protein binding to the intracellular domain of short-R has been identified

as dual specific phosphatase DUDP1. PRL does not induce expression of DUDP1 but represses its phosphorylation. A physical association of this phosphatase with ERK1/2 and p38 MAPK has been identified. Using an in vitro phosphatase assay and overexpression studies, DUDP1 has been demonstrated as a MAPK phosphatase. These very recent results strongly suggest that deactivation of MAPK by short-R contributes to the severe ovarian defect observed in PRLR−/−short-R mice and demonstrate the novel association of short-R with DUPD1 (Devi et al., 2011).

PRL signals through short-R in the ovary and actively regulates the expression of several genes identified by microarray analysis (Halperin et al., 2008). Interestingly, Galt, whose mutation induces galactosemia (Forges et al., 2006), is down-regulated in PRLR−/ −short-R ovaries in contrast to their PRLR−/− littermates.

The mouse Galt promoter sequence contains a number of putative forkhead transcription factor sites, five of them being FOXO3 sites that may regulate Galt transcription. GALT participates in the metabolism of galactose to glucose (Onuma et al., 2006) and is highly expressed in ovaries and liver, which are the major sites of expression for this enzyme (Liu et al., 2000). Classic galactosemia is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from profound impairment of galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, the second enzyme in the pathway of galactose metabolism (Fig. 3). Accumulation of galactose-1-phosphate is thought to inhibit the enzymes that are involved in glucose metabolism leading to deficient glycosylation reactions and a decrease in energy production in ovarian cells. In women, either mutations in Galt or a deficiency in enzyme activity cause galactosemia associated with POI (Forges et al., 2006). Young women with this disease are fertile early in life but become sterile in their late 20’s, displaying ovaries formed by interstitial cells and devoid of follicles, similar to those seen in PRLR−/−short-R mice.

Interestingly, short-R activation downregulates both Foxo3 and Galt, two genes known to be critical for normal ovarian development (Castrillon et al., 2003; Forges et al., 2006; Hosaka et al., 2004). The negative regulation of Foxo3-Galt by PRL through short-R provides a mechanism that mediates the development of the acute ovarian defect displayed in PRLR−/−short-R transgenic females and also provides a link to the similar POI displayed by the Foxo3−/− mice and by women with GALT mutation (Halperin et al., 2008).

9. Fertility and prolactin in humans

Circulating serum prolactin is thought to reflect almost entirely pituitary PRL secretion, while other extra pituitary sources probably contribute primarily to local tissue PRL levels. Unlike rodents, the role of PRL in human function is unclear, largely because no disruptive mutations of human *PRL* or the human *PRLR* have ever been identified in reproductive pathologies.

Hyperprolactinemia in men can lead to infertility, impotence or reproductive disturbances, suggesting that PRL contributes to optimal reproduction in human. However, no clear function could be ascribed to PRL in male mammals, including humans (Bole-Feysot et al., 1998). Data have suggested that, generally, this hormone positively modulates several aspects of testicular function. Thus, PRL has been presented as being involved in the maintenance of cellular morphology (Nag et al., 1981) and in the up-regulation of LH receptor number on Leydig cells (Dombrowicz et al., 1992; Purvis et al., 1979). The *PRLR−/−* model has allowed demonstrating that none of the male reproductive tract organ parameters or functions was affected (Binart et al., 2003b).

There is some evidence that a PRL surge occurs during ovulation coincident with the secretory peak of LH as in rodents, although the extent seems to be weaker in women than in rats (Ben Jonathan et al., 2008). The normal daily PRL secretory profile is characterized by a rise during nocturnal sleep and a rapid fall after awakening but it is still controversial whether this surge follows the sleep-wakening cycle or the circadian rhythm. High levels of circulating PRL, in physiology and pathological situations, are known to cause infertility. Dysovulation is the most common disorder of the hyperprolactinemia, but the precise mechanisms by which PRL influences the neuroendocrine axis are yet to be deciphered. Hyperprolactinaemia results in inhibition of gonadotrophin releasing hormone (GnRH) release pulsatility from the hypothalamus and subsequent inhibition of LH and follicle stimulating hormone (Bouchard et al., 1985; Zinaman et al., 1995), leading to inhibition of ovarian function. Nevertheless, a small proportion of GnRH neurons in mouse express *PRLR* while there is a high level of *PRLR* expression in brain regions involved in the control of GnRH secretion. A recent study in mouse, suggests that PRL actions on GnRH neurons are predominantly mediated indirectly through afferent pathways as kisspeptin (Kokay et al., 2011). Kisspeptin is a new fundamental actor of the gonadotrope axis in both rodents and human, and the most important stimulator of GnRH, this regulation might explain PRL-induced dysovulation in women. Moreover, KiSS-1/kisspeptin and its receptor KiSS1R are expressed in both human and non-human primate ovary but the local role on ovarian physiology in mammals has to be elucidated (Gaytan et al., 2009).

Furthermore, no study has yet compared the distribution of *PRLR* in human ovaries to that in murine ovaries or examined the PRL signaling pathway in human tissue. A recent review summarized what we can learn from rodents about prolactin in humans on reproductive cycle, pregnancy and fetal development and mammary gland (Ben Jonathan et al., 2008). There is no evidence that PRL is luteotropic in the human CL; instead, pituitary LH supports luteal development and steroidogenesis during the menstrual cycle. Moreover, in women hCG secretion by the embryonic trophoblast serves a function that is analogous to PRL in sustaining the CL during early pregnancy (Devoto et al., 2009). Nevertheless, both PRL and the *PRLR* are expressed in the luteinised human ovary (Schwarzler et al., 1997; Vlahos et al., 2001), while PRL acting as a survival factor in granulosa cells (Perks et al., 2003). POI is a common cause of infertility and premature aging in women, with an estimated 1% incidence; the vast majority of cases of POI are idiopathic, but the possibility that POI results from a mutation in long-R is intriguing and deserves further investigation. Nevertheless,

despite clear evidence of PRLR involvement in folliculogenesis in mice, we were unable to find any *PRLR* mutations associated with non-syndromic POI in nearly 100 women (Bachelot et al., 2010).

10. Conclusions

PRL is an incomparable hormone with important implications for reproduction and sexual behavior. This review aims to highlight essential findings on novel PRL signaling, and to discuss the implications for reproductive function. In a broad sense, PRL is critical for reproduction in both rodents and humans, given that lactation represents a continuum of the reproductive process. Although it is not yet clear how PRL signals in the human ovary, signaling pathways induced by prolactin through its short form should be an interesting avenue for research. Such studies may provide greater insight into normal processes of ovarian development and function as well as causes of ovarian dysfunction.

The precise tissue distribution, interactions, and specific signaling pathways that are mediated by the various *PRLR* isoforms in human cells should also be undertaken.
