### Abstract
Over the past 60 years, chemotherapeutic agents that target thymidylate biosynthesis and the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) have remained among the most-successful drugs used in the treatment of cancer. Fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-fluorouracil and capecitabine, and antifolates, such as methotrexate and pemetrexed, induce a state of thymidylate deficiency and imbalances in the nucleotide pool that impair DNA replication and repair. TS-targeted agents are used to treat numerous solid and haematological malignancies, either alone or as foundational therapeutics in combination treatment regimens. We overview the pivotal discoveries that led to the rational development of thymidylate biosynthesis as a chemotherapeutic target, and highlight the crucial contribution of these advances to driving and accelerating drug development in the earliest era of cancer chemotherapy. The function of TS as well as the mechanisms and consequences of inhibition of this enzyme by structurally diverse classes of drugs with distinct mechanisms of action are also discussed. In addition, breakthroughs relating to TS-targeted therapies that transformed the clinical landscape in some of the most-difficult-to-treat cancers, such as pancreatic, colorectal and non-small-cell lung cancer, are highlighted. Finally, new therapeutic agents and novel mechanism-based strategies that promise to further exploit the vulnerabilities and target resistance mechanisms within the thymidylate biosynthesis pathway are reviewed.

### Introduction
The remarkable progress in our understanding of cancer-cell biology witnessed in the past 20 years has been made possible largely through technological advances and extensive collaborative efforts between the pharmaceutical, clinical, and research communities. However, the continuing quest to unravel the biology of tumour cells has revealed unanticipated levels of complexity, extending well beyond the genome and proteome.¹² The quantitative and functional analysis of transcriptomes, microRNAomes, and methylomes, as well as the discovery and cataloguing of previously known and novel mutations in both cell-line models and clinical specimens continues for numerous types of cancer.³ The information obtained promises to play a pivotal part in furthering our understanding of carcinogenesis, tumour progression, metastasis, and the mechanisms of sensitivity and resistance to drug treatment. The emergence of translational medicine has ushered in an unprecedented era of collaboration and sharing of information between basic scientists and clinicians. Such efforts have resulted in the evolution of a new generation of hypothesis-testing early phase clinical trials, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of novel therapies while concurrently enabling measurement of target-engagement and the exploration of patient enrichment and selection strategies through analysis of prespecified biomarkers.⁴ However, despite the overwhelming promise of these advancements, the development of anticancer agents is plagued by a discouragingly high rate of failure, which often occurs in late-stage clinical testing and, therefore, at substantial financial cost. Furthermore, the therapeutic effectiveness of cancer chemotherapy as a whole remains variable and, in most instances, is largely unpredictable, and thus represents a continued source of frustration and disappointment for both clinicians and patients. As this new era of cancer-drug development and stratified medicine continues to unfold, efforts to identify novel and effective therapeutic agents need to be implemented in parallel with the continued development of existing treatment strategies using therapeutic agents with proven effectiveness and targeting molecular pathways supported by decades of invaluable clinical experience.

In the past decade, the development of anticancer drugs has taken a calculated change in direction, with a considerable proportion of research shifting away from the conventional concept of cytotoxic chemotherapy to focus on the development of agents targeting molecules and signal transduction pathways that function aberrantly in cancer cells. The concept of targeting tumour-specific alterations and, therefore, sparing or limiting toxicity in normal tissues has received widespread enthusiasm. Spurred on by the notable success of the BCR–ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib in the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML),⁵ new therapeutic targets identified include growth factors, signalling molecules, proteins that regulate the cell cycle, and modulators of apoptosis and angiogenesis.

Key points

- Since the 1940s, inhibitors of thymidylate biosynthesis have remained among the most effective chemotherapies used in the treatment of cancer
- The enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) is a key metabolic bottleneck in the synthesis of thymidine monophosphate required for DNA replication in tumour cells and, therefore, represents an important therapeutic target
- The molecular consequences of TS inhibition can be complex and vary depending on the type of inhibitor, the tumour type and the expression levels of enzymes involved in drug metabolism
- Inhibitors of TS fall into two major classes, the fluoropyrimidines and antifolates; these TS-targeted therapies remain the foundation of many combination chemotherapies used in patients with difficult-to-treat cancers
- The application of existing TS-targeted agents continues to expand, with new approvals of these drugs for the treatment of solid tumours
- New combination therapeutic strategies have emerged and are entering clinical trials, such as those targeting dUTPase to exploit the uracil-misincorporation pathway and defective DNA repair that occurs during TS inhibition

In retrospect, however, the targeted therapy paradigm is not new and can be traced back to some of the early pioneers of chemotherapy, such as Farber<sup>6</sup> and Heidelberger<sup>7</sup> whose pivotal discoveries facilitated the development of some of the most-effective chemotherapeutic agents currently available (Figure 1). Among these drugs is the class of chemotherapeutic agents targeting the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TS) and the thymidine monophosphate (TMP; also known as thymidylate) biosynthetic pathway. Inhibition of TS by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), capecitabine, pemetrexed, and raltitrexed results in decreased production of TMP, thymidylate deficiency, and imbalances in cellular nucleotide pools, which slow tumour growth by impairing DNA replication and repair.<sup>8</sup> Although these agents are not targeted in the sense of interfering with or reversing the effect of a molecular alteration characteristic of cancer cells, they exploit a biochemical pathway that tumour cells are especially dependent on; therefore, cancer cells are vulnerable to ‘targeted’ inhibition of this pathway. As our understanding of biology in many cancer types has progressed dramatically, a reasonable expectation is that the use of TS-targeted agents in cancer therapy would steadily decline as new molecular-targeted therapies gain momentum. In fact, an opposite pattern has been observed, with TS-targeted agents not only remaining the cornerstone of therapy in some of the most-difficult-to-treat solid tumours and haematological malignancies, but also expanding with regard to clinical use as a result of new approvals and indications. Furthermore, the continued development of novel agents targeting thymidylate biosynthesis and rational approaches to pathway-based combination therapies is reigniting drug development in this often-overlooked pathway (Figure 1). Herein, thymidylate metabolism is introduced, the historical advances that established thymidylate biosynthesis as a key therapeutic target in cancer are reviewed, and the ongoing development of new strategies that exploit this pathway to treat various cancers or overcome treatment resistance are discussed.

### Thymidylate synthase—the bottle’s neck

The TS enzyme catalyses the reductive methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate (dUMP) to dTMP using 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate (5,10-CH₂THF) as the methyl-group donor. dTMP is subsequently phosphorylated to deoxythymidine triphosphate (dTTP), an essential precursor for DNA replication and repair (Figure 2). As TS represents the sole intracellular source of *de novo* TMP, the inhibition of this rate-limiting enzyme exploits one of the few metabolic bottlenecks in the biosynthesis of DNA. Highlighting the importance of this enzyme to the proliferation and survival of cancer cells, TS is overexpressed in numerous tumour types, exhibits oncogene-like activity when forcibly overexpressed in mammalian cells,<sup>9</sup> and can repress p53 expression by decreasing the translational efficiency of mRNA encoding this tumour-suppressor protein.<sup>10</sup> Thus, TS serves as a critical point of intervention in cancer chemotherapy.

The TS enzyme functions as a homodimer, with both subunits containing binding sites for the nucleotide (dUMP) and folate (5,10-CH₂THF) substrates. These distinct binding sites provide the potential to disrupt TS activity using two structurally diverse classes of inhibitors, nucleotide and folate analogues. Antifolates target the folate-binding site, whereas the fluoropyrimidine class of chemotherapeutic agents targets the nucleotide-binding site of TS.

#### The development of fluoropyrimidines

5-FU is the best-known fluoropyrimidine and was first synthesized by Heidelberger *et al.*<sup>11</sup> in 1957 (Figure 1). This agent represents one of the earliest examples of a rationally designed targeted therapy, as its conception and development stemmed from four previously documented phenomena (Box 1):<sup>7</sup> firstly, the profound alterations in biological function (physiochemical and pharmacological) when hydrogen is substituted by fluorine in many classes of compounds;<sup>12</sup> secondly, the promising antitumour activity of nucleic acid analogues;<sup>13</sup> thirdly, the observation that rat hepatoma tumours incorporated uracil into DNA to a markedly greater extent than normal tissues;<sup>14</sup> and finally, earlier reports that synthetic uracil-based compounds, such as 6-azauracil, had demonstrated anti-tumour activity.<sup>15</sup> Heidelberger and colleagues<sup>11</sup> capitalized on these observations by designing fluorinated uracil-based pyrimidine analogues that might be effective in disrupting tumour DNA biosynthesis by targeting the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway. This rationale proved correct and, although the precise mechanisms of action were unknown at the time, several fluoropyrimidines demonstrated promising activity against multiple cancer types and went on to enter widespread clinical use. In 2014, almost 60 years after it was first synthesized, 5-FU remains one of the most widely used chemotherapeutic agents with broad-spectrum activity against many solid tumours, including colorectal cancer (CRC), pancreas, breast, head and neck, gastric, and ovarian cancers. Without question, the greatest influence of 5-FU has been in CRC, a disease in which 5-FU remains the most-effective therapeutic agent in the metastatic setting and substantially reduces the risk of disease recurrence in the adjuvant setting.<sup>16</sup> Importantly, 5-FU is the central component in many of the most-effective multidrug treatment

regimens used in difficult-to-treat cancers and is a viable monotherapy when more-aggressive combination therapies are inappropriate.

## The evolution of fluoropyrimidines

The development of effective fluoropyrimidine-based TS inhibitors continued with the introduction of the oral fluoropyrimidines (the pharmacokinetic properties of 5-FU necessitate intravenous administration), such as tegafur–uracil, capecitabine and S-1, all of which are prodrugs that rely on metabolic conversion to 5-FU as their primary mechanism of cytotoxicity (Figure 3). The rationally-designed drug capecitabine is converted to 5-FU via a pathway comprising three sequential enzymatic reactions, exploiting elevated intratumoural expression of the enzymes that can catalyse the final reaction, thymidine phosphorylase¹⁷ and uridine phosphorylase.¹⁸ Following rapid and near-complete absorption via the gastrointestinal tract, capecitabine is converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorocytidine (5'dFCR) by the hepatic enzyme, carboxylesterase. 5'dFCR is then converted to 5'-deoxy-5-fluorouridine (5'dFUR) by the enzyme cytidine deaminase, which is expressed in both liver and tumour tissues.¹⁹ The final step is the conversion of 5'dFUR to form the active metabolite, 5-FU, and is catalysed by either of the pyrimidine phosphorylases (thymidine phosphorylase or uridine phosphorylase). Both thymidine phosphorylase and uridine phosphorylase are frequently overexpressed in tumour tissues compared with normal tissue, and the corresponding high activity of these enzymes in tumour tissues confers considerable tumour specificity to capecitabine, resulting in 5-FU concentrations approximately threefold greater in tumour tissues versus adjacent normal tissues;¹⁸,²⁰,²¹ thus, systemic exposure to 5-FU is limited through this mechanism, to some extent. In addition, capecitabine has a largely similar efficacy and toxicity profile compared to 5-FU and, therefore, represents a viable alternative therapeutic option.²²,²³

S-1 is another oral therapy that combines three pharmacological agents: tegafur, a prodrug of 5-FU that is bioactivated by the hepatic enzyme cytochrome P450 2A6 via 5'-hydroxylation and spontaneous degradation to 5-FU (Figure 3); 5-chloro-2,4-dihydroxypyridine (CDHP; also known as gimeracil), which slows 5-FU catabolism by inhibiting dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase (DPD), a hepatic enzyme involved in pyrimidine base reduction and degradation; and potassium oxonate (also known as oteracil potassium), to alleviate gastrointestinal toxicity.²⁴ Thus, the rationale behind this drug formulation is to enhance the pharmacokinetic profile of 5-FU, while minimizing the incidence of gastrointestinal toxicity. The inclusion of CDHP is reported to increase the systemic concentration of 5-FU, and thus exposure of tumour cells to this molecule, by competitively inhibiting DPD-mediated catabolism of this pyrimidine base.²⁵ In addition, CDHP also reduces the production of fluoro-β-alanine, the primary catabolite of 5-FU that can contribute to cardiotoxic and neurotoxic adverse events.²⁶ Potassium oxonate is selectively distributed to the small and large intestine following oral administration, where it prevents the phosphorylation of 5-FU to FUMP by inhibiting the activity of orotate phosphoribosyltransferase (OPRT).²⁷ FUMP is reportedly a major contributor to the occurrence of gastrointestinal toxicity after administration of 5-FU.²⁸ Since its initial approval in 1999, S-1 has become the standard-of-care treatment for gastric cancer in Japan,²⁹ and has been approved for use

Figure 2 | The thymidylate biosynthesis pathway. TS catalyses the conversion of dUMP to dTMP, using 5,10-CH₂THF as the methyl-group donor. Subsequently, dTMP can be converted into dTTP via dTDP. Folic acid and other serum folates represent dietary sources of reduced folate that can be metabolized to produce 5,10-CH₂THF, which is essential for the TS reaction and thymidylate biosynthesis. The presence of a pyrimidine nucleotide and folate binding sites on the TS enzyme provides two unique opportunities for inhibition by structurally diverse classes of drugs: pyrimidine analogues (fluoropyrimidines) and folate analogues (antifolates). As TS-dependent conversion of dUMP to dTMP is required for production of dTTP, TS-targeted agents can inhibit the synthesis and repair of DNA that is required for cancer-cell proliferation and survival.

in CRC and non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), as well as head and neck, metastatic breast, pancreatic and biliary tract cancers. In Europe, S-1 combined with cisplatin also proved an efficacious alternative to 5-FU and cisplatin therapy in gastric cancer.³⁰ Tegafur–uracil is another combined therapy that shares the same active cytotoxic fluoropyrimidine component as S-1 (tegafur), but with uracil included in the formulation as the competitive inhibitor of DPD to slow hepatic degradation of the pyrimidine base. Although tegafur–uracil remains an investigational drug in the USA, this agent is approved in more than 50 countries, predominantly for the treatment of advanced-stage CRC and other advanced-stage solid tumours.

Interestingly, despite sharing 5-FU as the active cytotoxic component, the toxicity profiles of fluoropyrimidine-based treatments that include a DPD inhibitor, such as S-1 and tegafur–uracil, display some distinct differences when compared with similar therapies that do not include a DPD inhibitor. Specifically, hand–foot syndrome (also known as chemotherapy-induced acral erythema, palmar–plantar erythrodysesthesia, or palmoplantar erythrodysesthesia), an adverse event commonly observed in patients treated using infusional 5-FU or capecitabine, has a substantially lower incidence and severity in patients treated with fluoropyrimidine formulations that incorporate inhibitors of DPD.³¹ This evidence suggests that hand–foot syndrome might be caused by products of DPD-mediated catabolism of 5-FU.

The antifolate legacy

Early antifolates

Inhibition of thymidylate biosynthesis, either directly or indirectly, was also discovered to be one of the major mechanisms of action of the antifolates that entered cancer therapy in the late 1940s.³² In 1948, Farber and Diamond described the ‘acceleration phenomenon’, whereby the administration of folic acid conjugates in children with acute leukaemia seemed to accelerate the leukaemic process.⁶ They proposed that this phenomenon might be reversed by treating patients with folic acid antagonists.⁶ Indeed, aminopterin, one of the earliest antifolates, was successful in inducing temporary remission in 10 of the first 16 children with acute leukaemia who were treated with this agent (Figure 1).⁶ The aminopterin homologue methotrexate was eventually established as the primary antifolate used clinically in treating cancers such as leukaemias, lymphomas, osteosarcoma, breast cancer, and head and neck cancers, owing to an improved therapeutic index compared with aminopterin.³³ Methotrexate is credited as the first curative chemotherapy in patients with choriocarcinoma,³⁴ and induced complete remissions in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL).³⁵ Methotrexate administered with folic acid is also recognized as one of the first chemotherapeutic agents to effectively prevent the recurrence of osteosarcoma after surgical removal of the primary tumour,³⁶ establishing the principle of adjuvant therapy.

REVIEWS

Box 1 | 5-fluorouracil—an early example of a rationally designed chemotherapy

Charles Heidelberger<sup>7,11,106</sup> designed novel fluoropyrimidine compounds based on four previously documented phenomena:

- When substituted for hydrogen, fluorine was known to profoundly alter the biological function of experimental compounds (physiochemical and pharmacological)<sup>12</sup>
- Early nucleic-acid analogues had demonstrated promising antitumour activity<sup>13</sup>
- Rat hepatoma tumours incorporated uracil into DNA to a considerably greater extent than normal tissues<sup>14</sup>
- Synthetic uracil-based compounds such as 6-azauracil had demonstrated promising, albeit limited, antitumour activity<sup>15</sup>

Heidelberger capitalized on these observations and synthesized the fluorinated-pyrimidine analogue, 5-fluorouracil, that is still in widespread clinical use more than 50 years later.

---

The early folate analogues, such as aminopterin and methotrexate, were subsequently discovered to be competitive inhibitors of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR; Figure 3),<sup>37</sup> the enzyme responsible for reducing dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF). This reaction is an important step in a number of folate-dependent reactions involving methyl-group transfer, including supplying the methyl-group donor, 5,10-CH₂THF, involved in the TS reaction (Figure 2). In fact, impeding the recycling of 5,10-CH₂THF through methotrexate-mediated inhibition was found to potently suppress thymidylate synthesis, and impair DNA replication and repair.<sup>38</sup> Subsequent research identified direct TS inhibition as a primary mechanism of methotrexate-induced cytotoxicity, with polyglutamation of the parent drug by folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) leading to the accumulation of methotrexate polyglutamates that were found to be potent TS inhibitors (Figure 3).<sup>39,40</sup> To this day, methotrexate remains a widely used chemotherapeutic agent worldwide and is used in the treatment of numerous malignancies, including ALL, gestational trophoblastic disease, cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, osteosarcoma, head and neck, lung, and breast cancers (Table 1).

### Next-generation antifolates

The early clinical successes with TS inhibitors such as 5-FU and methotrexate highlighted the importance of the thymidylate biosynthesis pathway as a viable therapeutic target in cancer, and prompted the search for more-potent targeted TS inhibitors.<sup>41</sup> One of the first rationally designed antifolates to be clinically evaluated was CB 3717, a quinazoline-based inhibitor of TS (Figure 1).<sup>42</sup> However, despite potent inhibition of TS and notable antitumour activity, the clinical development of CB 3717 was limited by poor aqueous solubility at acidic pHs, which was associated with severe nephrotoxicity.<sup>43</sup>

#### Raltitrexed

A drug screen of >3,000 quinazoline analogues, performed by the Institute of Cancer Research and pharmaceutical collaborators in the UK, identified a series of novel candidate antifolates with improved pharmacological properties (Figure 1).<sup>41</sup> One of the most-promising compounds identified, raltitrexed, is a water-soluble folate analogue that potently inhibits TS and, to a considerably lesser extent, DHFR.<sup>44</sup> The discovery of raltitrexed was pivotal in demonstrating that an in-depth understanding of the relationships between toxicity and the molecular structure of a compound could guide drug discovery, enabling the synthesis of novel agents with more-manageable toxicity profiles while retaining potency for the intended target and antitumour activity. Raltitrexed is transported into cells via the folate transporter 1 (FOLT; also known as reduced folate carrier protein) and, similarly to methotrexate, undergoes rapid polyglutamation by the enzyme FPGS.<sup>45</sup> Upon polyglutamation the potency of TS inhibition by raltitrexed is increased by up to 100-fold and cellular retention of the drug is greatly extended.<sup>46</sup> Raltitrexed inhibits TS directly and specifically, without requiring any other modulating agent and, as an analogue of the 5,10-CH₂THF cofactor rather than the pyrimidine substrate, is not incorporated into DNA (Figure 3; Figure 4).<sup>46</sup> As a pure TS inhibitor, the mechanism of raltitrexed action is not complicated by the multiple outcomes of DNA and RNA incorporation in addition to TS inhibition, and, unlike other TS-targeted agents, the specific activity of raltitrexed on TS does not require the activity of multiple and varied metabolic enzymes. This therapeutic agent has been investigated extensively in clinical trials involving patients with a number of different types of solid tumours, including patients with CRC in whom raltitrexed was demonstrated to have manageable toxicity and similar clinical activity to 5-FU.<sup>47</sup> Despite a more attractive and practical administration schedule than current infusional 5-FU regimens, evidence of a lack of survival benefit attributable to raltitrexed has limited the use of this agent to investigational studies in the USA.<sup>48</sup> Nonetheless, raltitrexed is an effective TS inhibitor with approvals for differing indications in many European countries, Australia, Canada, and Japan, including metastatic CRC and mesothelioma, and remains under clinical investigation.<sup>49</sup>

#### Pemetrexed

Pemetrexed is a folate analogue that inhibits TS in addition to several other folate-dependent enzymes (Figure 3), including DHFR, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide transformylase (AICART), and glycine ribonucleotide transformylase (GART).<sup>50,51</sup> Thus, pemetrexed is often referred to as a multitargeted antifolate, and studies have reported that inhibition of enzymes other than TS can contribute to therapeutic activity of this drug.<sup>52</sup> Specifically, inhibition of AICART and, to a lesser extent, GART leads to perturbation of purine synthesis.<sup>52</sup> Most of the available evidence indicates that the inhibition of TS is the predominant mechanism of pemetrexed-mediated cytotoxicity, as this outcome can be markedly attenuated by treatment with exogenous thymidine at effective drug concentrations (that is, the half-maximal inhibitory concentration [IC₅₀]);<sup>51</sup> however, in contrast to more specific TS inhibitors, such as raltitrexed, total reversal of pemetrexed-induced cytotoxicity at higher drug concentrations typically requires

Figure 3 | Mechanism of action of fluoropyrimidines and antifolates. Through the action of anabolic enzymes involved in pyrimidine nucleotide synthesis, 5-FU is converted to three main active metabolites: FdUMP, FdUTP and FUTP. The active metabolite FdUMP is a tight-binding inhibitor of TS, which causes rapid depletion of dTTP and thymine-less cell death. FdUTP and FUTP can be incorporated into DNA and RNA, respectively, contributing to 5-FU cytotoxicity. The oral prodrugs S-1, tegafur and capecitabine undergo enzymatic activation to 5-FU. Capecitabine is an oral fluoropyrimidine that is absorbed unchanged through the gastrointestinal wall and is converted to 5'dFUR in the liver by the sequential action of carboxylesterase and cytidine deaminase. Tegafur is the cytotoxic component of tegafur–uracil and S-1, and is enzymatically activated in the liver to 5'-hydroxytegafur and subsequently to 5-FU. Raltitrexed and methotrexate enter the cell primarily via FOLT, whereas pemetrexed is also transported by PCFT. Raltitrexed, methotrexate and pemetrexed all undergo polyglutamation by FPGS, and the polyglutamated forms of these agents are potent inhibitors of various folate-dependent enzymes, including TS, resulting in depletion of dTTP, as well as inhibition of folate recycling and purine synthesis pathways. The monophosphate form of TFT is a reversible tight-binding inhibitor of TS, whereas the triphosphate form of this compound (TFT-TP) is readily incorporated into DNA.

Pemetrexed has demonstrated anticancer activity in vitro in numerous cell lines representative of varying tumour types, including colon, renal, liver, and lung cancers.⁵⁴,⁵⁵ Of note, pemetrexed has been the subject of extensive clinical investigation and this agent has received FDA approval for the first-line and maintenance treatment of nonsquamous NSCLC,⁵⁶ as well as the treatment of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma.⁵⁷ Importantly, this agent has also been associated with substantial clinical responses in some tumour types, such as lung cancer, that are not typically sensitive to classic antifolates.⁵⁶ This observation might be attributed to several intriguing features of the mechanisms through which the anticancer effects of pemetrexed are exerted. Specifically, pemetrexed was reported to exert antiproliferative effects in a variety of human cancer models via indirect inhibition of the mTOR signalling pathway.⁵⁸ mTOR represents a key convergence point and critical effector in growth factor signalling pathways that are frequently deregulated in human cancer. Interestingly, this novel activity of pemetrexed was shown to be mediated by the accumulation of an intermediate in the purine biosynthesis pathway, aminoimidazole carboxamide ribonucleotide, as a result of AICART inhibition (Figure 3).⁵⁹

Similar to other antifolate agents such as methotrexate and raltitrexed, FPGS-mediated polyglutamation of pemetrexed after it enters the cell is required for the maximal inhibitory effects of this agent on its various target enzymes.⁵⁹ In contrast to other antifolates, however, two primary mechanisms have been reported for the cellular uptake of pemetrexed (Figure 3).⁶⁰ These mechanisms involve two distinct facilitative folate transporters, FOLT and the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT), with the latter transporter functioning at low pH,⁶¹ a physical property that might facilitate the uptake of this drug in hypoxic tumour environments. The high affinity of pemetrexed for both FOLT and PCFT has important implications in the development of resistance. The observation that PCFT-mediated uptake can sustain pemetrexed activity even in the absence of FOLT (a known resistance mechanism to other antifolates), suggests redundancy exists in the transport of this agent;⁶⁰ thus, tumour cells are unlikely to become resistant to pemetrexed as a result of impaired cellular uptake by these genetically distinct transporters.

# The consequences of TS inhibition

Numerous mechanisms mediate the molecular events that occur downstream of TS inhibition, which differ depending on the type of inhibitor used, the type of tumour tissue, and the variable expression of key enzymes involved in drug metabolism (Table 1). An event common to all TS inhibitors is the rapid depletion of TMP pools resulting in subsequent depletion of TTP,⁶⁶ which induces perturbations in the levels of the other deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP) molecules through feedback mechanisms.⁶⁷ These imbalances in the cellular pool of dNTPs are thought to severely disrupt DNA synthesis and repair, resulting in cell-cycle arrest and DNA damage (Figure 3). In addition, inhibition of TS results in the accumulation of dUMP, which, upon sequential phosphorylation by pyrimidine monophosphate and diphosphate kinases, can lead to increased levels of deoxyuridine triphosphate (dUTP).⁶⁸ As DNA polymerases use dUTP and TTP as a substrate with equal efficiency, excess dUTP can lead to an increased level of uracil misincorporation into DNA, resulting in severe disruption of DNA synthesis.⁶⁹ The base-excision repair (BER) enzyme uracil-DNA glycosylase (UDG) subsequently removes the misincorporated uracil base from the DNA, leaving an apyrimidinic site.⁷⁰ If TTP levels remain low and dUTP pools remain high, uracil (as dUTP) will be re-incorporated into DNA and subsequently re-excised leading to futile cycles of uracil-DNA repair, resulting in catastrophic DNA damage and, eventually, cell lethality.⁷¹ However, DNA damage due to misincorporation of dUTP is highly dependent on the levels of the pyrophosphatase dUTP nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase), which degrades dUTP to dUMP and, therefore, limits intracellular accumulation of this nucleotide, protecting tumour DNA from the detrimental effects of genomic uracil misincorporation (Figure 4).⁷²

Although numerous branch-points exist in the complex metabolic pathway by which fluoropyrimidines are modified after administration, evidence suggests that several key metabolites are the primary effectors of the antitumour effect of these agents.⁶⁷ The most-important metabolite, fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP), is a tight-binding inhibitor of TS,⁷³ which forms an irreversible ternary complex with the folate co-factor 5,10-CH₂THF and the TS enzyme during the TS-catalysed reaction. Inhibition of TS along with misincorporation of FdUTP (and dUTP) into DNA, disrupts DNA synthesis and necessitates an increase in the frequency of BER events.⁶⁷ FdUTP is also a substrate for dUTPase; thus, high levels of this enzyme can reportedly protect DNA from both FdUTP and dUTP misincorporation during TS inhibition.⁶⁸

The misincorporation of fluorouridine triphosphate (FUTP) into RNA and the subsequent disruption of

**Figure 4 |** dUTPase protects tumour cells from mechanisms of cytotoxicity during TS inhibition. Inhibition of TS induces a metabolic blockade, resulting in depletion of thymidylate and a corresponding accumulation of the TS substrate dUMP, which can be phosphorylated to dUTP. When cellular levels of dUTP increase, the activity of the enzyme that catalyses the reversion of this nucleotide to dUMP, dUTPase, can become saturated resulting and an excess of dUTP and misincorporation of uracil into DNA. In the absence of TTP, iterative cycles of uracil misincorporation and subsequent DNA repair causes extensive DNA damage, which can result in cell death. In tumours with elevated expression of dUTPase, saturation of this enzyme activity is unlikely to occur and dUTP misincorporation is prevented as a mechanism of cytotoxicity. Metabolic conversion of 5-FU (and its prodrugs) to FdUTP and subsequent incorporation into DNA has also been shown to induce significant cytotoxicity and dUTPase has been shown to possess affinity for FdUTP, catalysing its hydrolysis to FdUMP and, therefore, preventing the misincorporation of FdUTP into DNA. In this context, the novel dUTPase inhibitor TAS-114 might enhance the effectiveness of TS inhibition in several ways: by promoting the accumulation and misincorporation of dUTP into DNA; by increasing the incorporation of FdUTP (when combined with fluoropyrimidine therapy) into DNA; and by prevent the recycling of dUTP, therefore, limiting the availability of the natural substrate for the TS reaction and a competitor for FdUMP binding to TS, dUMP.

## Pralatrexate

The antifolate legacy has been continued with the development and approval of pralatrexate, a folate analogue closely related to methotrexate, but rationally designed to have improved affinity for both FOLT and FPGS.⁶² As a result, pralatrexate is more effectively internalized via FOLT, and undergoes rapid polyglutamation leading to improved cellular retention and superior antitumour activity when compared with methotrexate.⁶² Pralatrexate is similar to methotrexate in that its primary target is DHFR;⁶² however, whereas methotrexate polyglutamates are known potent TS inhibitors,³⁹,⁴⁰ to what extent—if any—pralatrexate polyglutamates can directly inhibit TS is not clear at present. Pralatrexate has now been granted accelerated approval by the FDA for patients with relapsed or refractory peripheral T-cell lymphoma based on the promising efficacy results of an open-label, multicentre, international trial that evaluated pralatrexate in 115 heavily pretreated patients with this malignancy.⁶³ This trial demonstrated an overall response rate of 27%

**VOLUME 11 | MAY 2014 | 289**net RNA synthesis have also been reported to contribute to 5-FU-related cytotoxicity *in vitro* (Figure 3).<sup>74,75</sup> Misincorporation of 5-FU bases into RNA inhibits the processing of pre-ribosomal RNA into mature ribosomal RNA, and disrupts the assembly and activity of small nuclear RNA–protein complexes as well as the post-transcriptional modification of transfer RNAs.<sup>76,78</sup> Importantly, studies have also shown that exogenous uridine can confer protection from the cytotoxicity of 5-FU,<sup>74,75,79</sup> providing strong evidence of contributory cytotoxicity from the RNA-directed effects of this compound. One caveat is that the RNA-directed effects of 5-FU are also reported to contribute to fluoropyrimidine-related toxicity and adverse events. Studies in preclinical models demonstrated that elevated doses of 5-FU followed by rescue treatment with uridine or uridine diphosphoglucose could mitigate the anticipated toxicity (predominantly myelosuppression and gastrointestinal), whereas the antitumour activity of this agent was retained.<sup>80</sup> With regard to 5-FU in particular, the current infusional regimens that incorporate folic acid are reported to favour TS inhibition and subsequent DNA-directed effects of this agent, rather than the RNA-directed effects that are more frequently associated with bolus 5-FU regimens,<sup>81</sup> probably as this folate is a precursor of the 5,10-CH<sub>2</sub>THF co-factor needed for ternary complex formation. Despite the substantial research surrounding the fluoropyrimidines, and their metabolism and mechanism of action, accurately correlating the cytotoxicity of these drugs with the expression or activity of key enzymes and their metabolites remains difficult owing to the complexity of the pathway. Although the cytotoxicity induced by fluoropyrimidines in the clinic is almost certainly a combination of one or more of these mechanisms, the preclinical and clinical experience with these agents has led to the widespread consensus that inhibition of TS, resulting in thymidylate deficiency, is the predominant mechanism of fluoropyrimidine-based antitumour activity.

### Breaking new ground with TS inhibitors

#### Improving the efficacy and safety of therapy
Efforts to improve the efficacy of therapies targeting the thymidylate biosynthetic pathway have had variable success. The incorporation of folic acid into 5-FU regimens used in the clinic was an important step in demonstrating that enhancement of the clinical efficacy of 5-FU therapy was possible. Folic acid is metabolized intracellularly to the reduced folate 5,10-CH<sub>2</sub>THF, and elevated levels of this co-factor have been demonstrated to enhance the formation of the ternary complex between FdUMP, 5,10-CH<sub>2</sub>THF, and TS.<sup>82</sup> Incorporation of folic acid into clinical 5-FU regimens was associated with improved response rates in patients with CRC compared with 5-FU alone (23% versus 11%),<sup>83</sup> which has been attributed to enhanced inhibition of TS.<sup>81</sup> Indeed, folic acid remains a key component in all 5-FU-based regimens currently in use. In addition, continuous infusion of 5-FU was associated with a marked improvement in the therapeutic index, with improved clinical outcome and a more-favourable toxicity profile, compared with bolus injection of this agent (Figure 1).<sup>84</sup> As introduced earlier, continuous 5-FU exposure schedules are reported to favour TS inhibition in comparison with bolus schedules, which are associated with higher peak levels of drug exposure and favour metabolite incorporation into RNA and DNA.<sup>85</sup> These key developments in the clinical 5-FU regimens have demonstrated that an increased understanding of the functioning of a TS inhibitor at the molecular level can be translated into tangible improvements in clinical efficacy by modulating the biochemical pathways involved.

In addition to efforts to enhance therapeutic efficacy, understanding the molecular basis for the development of toxicity after treatment with TS-targeted agents has proved an equally important area of research. In early clinical studies, the antifolate pemetrexed demonstrated promising broad-spectrum antitumour activity, but at the expense of considerable drug-related toxicity, with 50% of patients who were treated with this agent experiencing grade 3–4 neutropenia and gastrointestinal toxicity events.<sup>86</sup> Of particular concern was the development of grade 4 neutropenia with grade 3–4 infection, grade 3–4 diarrhoea, or grade 3–4 mucositis that became life threatening.<sup>86</sup> A comprehensive analysis of the incidence of adverse events in patients treated with this antifolate identified elevated homocysteine, a marker of folate deficiency, as a biomarker for pemetrexed-related toxicity.<sup>86,87</sup> Correcting folate deficiency through the administration of folic acid and vitamin B<sub>12</sub> substantially reduced pemetrexed-associated toxicity without adversely affecting the efficacy of this agent.<sup>86</sup>

#### Combination therapies

##### 5-FU plus oxaliplatin and irinotecan
In CRC, 5-FU remains the foundation chemotherapeutic agent on which the most-effective first-line combination therapy regimens are based. Synergistic interactions observed between 5-FU and other DNA-damaging chemotherapies led to the clinical evaluation of combinations of 5-FU and folic acid with oxaliplatin (a platinum-based DNA-crosslinking chemotherapeutic agent), referred to as FOLFOX,<sup>88</sup> as well as the combination of 5-FU and folic acid with irinotecan (an inhibitor of topoisomerase I), a combination known as FOLFIRI.<sup>89</sup> These triple-drug therapies, frequently administered along with the EGFR-targeted antibodies cetuximab or panitumumab, or the VEGF-targeted antibody bevacizumab, represent the two most-effective cytotoxic combination chemotherapies currently used in advanced CRC, with FOLFOX also being employed in the adjuvant setting in patients with high-risk disease.<sup>88,89</sup> In variants of these regimens, 5-FU and folic acid can be replaced with capecitabine or S-1 in combination chemotherapies termed XELOX and CAPOX (both are regimens combining capecitabine plus oxaliplatin, but with modifications to the oxaliplatin dose and schedule), XELIRI (capecitabine with irinotecan; also known as CAPIRI), SOX (S-1 combined with oxaliplatin), and IRIS (S-1 and irinotecan).<sup>90–93</sup>In 2010, the FOLFIRINOX regimen, consisting of 5-FU plus folinic acid, irinotecan, and oxaliplatin, emerged as an efficacious therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with metastatic pancreatic cancer with a good performance status (Figure 1).<sup>94</sup> Metastatic pancreatic cancer is associated with some of the poorest outcomes of all solid tumours, and treatment advances in this disease have been painstakingly incremental with numerous clinical trials failing to demonstrate anything but modest improvements in survival compared with standard gemcitabine monotherapy.<sup>95,96</sup> Capitalizing on the previously observed synergy between TS inhibitors and irinotecan or oxaliplatin (and other platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents) in other cancer types, the FOLFIRINOX regimen elicited long-awaited pivotal increases in all clinical outcomes compared with gemcitabine monotherapy, including a clear overall survival benefit across all patient subgroups (11.1 months versus 6.8 months).<sup>94</sup> Despite the higher incidence of adverse events associated with the FOLFIRINOX regimen, a significant increase in the time to deterioration of quality of life was observed in the FOLFIRINOX group compared with the gemcitabine group: 31% of patients in the FOLFIRINOX group had a definitive degradation of the quality of life at 6 months versus 66% in the gemcitabine group (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30–0.70; \(P < 0.001\)).<sup>94</sup>

### Antifolates and cisplatin in MPM and NSCLC

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is a locally invasive and rapidly fatal malignancy strongly associated with occupational exposure to asbestos.<sup>97</sup> Although a relatively rare cancer, the incidence of MPM is expected to continue to increase worldwide over the next 20–30 years.<sup>98</sup> MPM is associated with a poor prognosis, as only 10–15% of patients are eligible for surgical resection at diagnosis.<sup>99</sup> Prior to 2003, palliative chemotherapy for unresectable disease was typically associated with only incremental increases in survival, and most single-agent chemotherapies, with the exception of cisplatin, were found to have limited effects on disease progression.<sup>99</sup> In 2003, however, a phase III randomized clinical trial of pemetrexed combined with cisplatin compared with cisplatin alone in patients with MPM demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in response rates (41.3% versus 16.7%; \(P < 0.0001\)), and overall survival (median of 12.1 months versus 9.3 months; \(P = 0.02\)).<sup>57</sup> The addition of pemetrexed to cisplatin therapy was also well tolerated when administered with vitamin B<sub>12</sub> and folic acid (Table 1).<sup>57</sup> Shortly thereafter, another randomized clinical trial demonstrated marked improvements in therapeutic efficacy and disease-related symptoms after treatment with a combination of raltitrexed and cisplatin compared with cisplatin monotherapy in the absence of any clear increase in toxicity.<sup>100</sup> These benchmark trials firmly established antifolate-containing cisplatin-based combination therapies as the first-line chemotherapy of choice for the treatment of inoperable MPM, and pemetrexed with cisplatin is the only regimen currently approved by the FDA in this setting.<sup>101</sup>

The combination of pemetrexed and cisplatin was subsequently compared to gemcitabine plus cisplatin therapy in a phase III randomized trial as the first-line therapy in patients with advanced NSCLC;<sup>56</sup> although the pemetrexed and cisplatin combination had similar efficacy in the total trial population, the improved tolerability and more convenient administration of this regimen established this approach as a new and effective first-line alternative to gemcitabine and cisplatin therapy.<sup>56</sup> Furthermore, a prespecified survival analysis based on histological assessments demonstrated that patients with nonsquamous-cell histology had substantially improved overall survival in the pemetrexed and cisplatin treatment cohort, compared with the cisplatin plus gemcitabine therapy cohort (12.6 months versus 10.9 months in patients with adenocarcinoma histology, and 10.4 months versus 6.7 months in individuals with large-cell carcinoma histology).<sup>56</sup> Conversely, in patients with squamous-cell histology, a survival advantage was associated with cisplatin and gemcitabine therapy, rather than pemetrexed and cisplatin treatment (10.8 months versus 9.4 months).<sup>56</sup> These observations provided pivotal support for pemetrexed and cisplatin combination therapy in the treatment of nonsquamous advanced-stage NSCLC, leading to the FDA and European Medicine Agency (EMA) approvals of this approach (Figure 1).<sup>102,103</sup> Subsequently, the PARAMOUNT trial<sup>104</sup> found that pemetrexed was an efficacious and well-tolerated maintenance therapy following pemetrexed and cisplatin combination chemotherapy in patients with this disease. Maintenance therapy with this antifolate considerably reduced the risk of disease progression, improved the disease-control rate and markedly improved overall survival in patients with nonsquamous advanced-stage NSCLC,<sup>104</sup> leading to the approval of pemetrexed in the maintenance setting by both the EMA and FDA,<sup>103,105</sup> and an important change to the NSCLC treatment paradigm.

#### Realizing the potential of trifluorothymidine

Trifluorothymidine (TFT) is another fluoropyrimidine, in addition to 5-FU, that was first synthesized by Heidelberger *et al.*<sup>106</sup> in 1962, and that showed promise as an inhibitor of DNA replication.<sup>107</sup> More than 50 years later, the potential of TFT as an antitumour agent is increasingly recognized. TFT is the active cytotoxic component of TAS-102, a novel oral nucleoside-based formulation that also contains a thymidine phosphorylase inhibitor (TPI), 5-chloro-6-(2-iminopyrrolidin-1-yl)methyl-2,4(1H,3H)-pyrimidinedione hydrochloride, to inhibit hepatic and intestinal degradation of TFT and improve bioavailability (Table 2).<sup>108</sup> Thymidine kinase processes TFT to produce the monophosphate nucleotide form of this fluoropyrimidine (TFT-MP), which is a reversible tight-binding inhibitor of TS (Figure 3).<sup>73,109</sup> In an *in vitro* study,<sup>110</sup> tumour cells with either increased TS expression or loss of TS expression seem to exhibit resistance to prolonged exposure to TFT, indicating that inhibition of this enzyme is the key mechanism of action attributable to this agent, at least under the experimental conditions used. Other reports, however, have

found that pulsed exposure of tumour cells to high concentrations of TFT for short periods of time results in substantial incorporation of the triphosphate nucleotide form of TFT (TFT-TP) into DNA, leading to extensive DNA fragmentation.<sup>108</sup> The general consensus is that the pulsed exposure approach more closely resembles the clinical regimens currently being evaluated and, therefore, this might be the more important mechanism for antitumour efficacy in patients. Nevertheless, these observations suggest that TFT, similar to other fluoropyrimidines, has multiple mechanisms of action, and that the primary mechanism of cytotoxicity after treatment with TFT might be time-dependent and exposure-dependent.

Interestingly, the repair mechanism associated with TFT-related DNA damage seems to be markedly different from that invoked by other fluoropyrimidines, involving different glycosylase enzymes.<sup>111</sup> Furthermore, TFT seems to be incorporated into DNA to a considerably greater extent than is observed with the metabolites of other fluoropyrimidines, such as 5-FU, resulting in a higher incidence of DNA double-strand breaks and persistent DNA damage.<sup>112,113</sup> Importantly, TFT has demonstrated antitumour activity in cells from cancers with both inherent and acquired mechanisms of resistance to 5-FU-dependent cytotoxicity,<sup>108</sup> and might, therefore, represent an effective alternative therapy in patients refractory to 5-FU. Promising preclinical evidence of synergy between TFT and both oxaliplatin<sup>114,115</sup> and irinotecan<sup>114,115</sup> has also been reported, suggesting that these agents could be components of effective future therapeutic combinations. In early clinical trials, TAS-102 was associated with promising therapeutic activity and a manageable toxicity profile in patients with solid tumours.<sup>116,117</sup> These trials included a phase II trial in individuals with heavily pretreated metastatic CRC, which demonstrated overall survival of 9.0 months in patients treated with TAS-102 compared with 6.6 months in the placebo group (*P* = 0.0011);<sup>117</sup> investigation of TFT has now advanced to phase III trials in this setting (Figure 1).<sup>118</sup>

Targeting drug-resistance mechanisms

TS expression and drug resistance

Considerable research effort has been directed at correlating the expression of TS with response to TS-targeted therapies. A wealth of preclinical data supports the concept that elevated TS expression confers cross-resistance to a broad-spectrum of structurally diverse TS inhibitors, to varying extents.<sup>119–122</sup> In addition, numerous clinical studies in a wide-range of malignancies, including some large analyses in CRC, have associated elevated intratumoural expression of TS with poor clinical outcomes after fluoropyrimidine-based therapy.<sup>123–127</sup> There is accumulating evidence for elevated TS expression as a mechanism of resistance to antifolates, including resistance to pemetrexed in both NSCLC<sup>128–130</sup> and MPM.<sup>131,132</sup> In NSCLC, the squamous-cell histological phenotype seems to be associated with a higher level of TS expression when compared with the nonsquamous-cell histological phenotype, which might explain the decreased efficacy of pemetrexed-based therapies in patients with squamous-cell NSCLC compared with responses observed in patients with nonsquamous-cell NSCLC.<sup>56,133</sup> In general, the majority of the published literature indicates that patients with low intratumoural expression levels of TS tend to have better responses to TS-targeted chemotherapy and longer survival than those with high expression of this enzyme. However, that disparity in the published reports does exist should be acknowledged, and is probably attributable to substantial variation in sample sizes, the methodologies used for quantitation of TS expression levels, and the interpretation of results between studies. Despite strong evidence that TS represents a useful predictive biomarker of responsiveness to TS-targeted therapies, such discrepancies have highlighted the need for standardization of analyses to enable the true potential of this biomarker to be realized in the clinic.<sup>134</sup>

The potential utility of TS expression levels to predict the outcome of TS-inhibitor-based chemotherapy is further confounded by the frequent observation that intratumoural TS expression is acutely induced in response

to treatment with TS inhibitors,^{135} which represents a potential mechanism of resistance. The proposed mechanisms mediating the acute induction of TS expression include the disruption of the autoregulatory translation of TS-encoding mRNA: binding of the TS enzyme to TS-encoding mRNA reduces the efficiency of TS enzyme translation; however, binding of a TS inhibitor disrupts the enzyme–mRNA complex, abrogating the translational repression mechanism and resulting in increased TS expression.^{136} An alternate explanation for the increased expression of TS observed after TS-targeted therapy comes from a study demonstrating that the inhibitor-bound enzyme is more stable than the inhibitor-free enzyme, suggesting that TS accumulates as a result of reduced turnover (enhanced stability) of the TS polypeptide.^{137} An important observation was that the induction of TS protein in response to fluoropyrimidine exposure resulted in levels of free (uninhibited) TS that were 50% higher than baseline levels, suggestive of increased *de novo* TS synthesis, such that sufficient thymidylate and DNA biosynthesis could be maintained.^{138}

The numerous branch-points and associated enzymes involved in the metabolism of both fluoropyrimidine and antifolate TS inhibitors might make their primary cytotoxic mechanisms tumour-dependent and more complex than a typical drug–target relationship. For example, evidence suggests that TS levels more accurately predict drug response in metastatic lesions than in the related primary tumour,^{127} potentially indicative of differences in the tumour biology and, therefore, responsiveness to TS-targeted therapy, as the disease progresses. In addition, a substantial percentage of patients with low expression of TS do not respond to TS-inhibitor-based therapy, reinforcing the concept that multifactorial mechanisms of resistance exist in the patient population (Box 2). Owing to these complexities in the relationships between levels of TS expression and therapeutic responses, the adoption of TS as a predictive biomarker for TS-inhibitor-based chemotherapy has not materialized. Furthermore, these findings indicate that assessment of any single biomarker is unlikely to be sufficient to predict the outcome of therapy. Nevertheless, in nonsquamous NSCLC, the type of cancer in which evidence supporting TS as a predictive biomarker seems especially promising for pemetrexed-based therapy, several ongoing and recently completed clinical trials are poised to help clarify whether TS expression does indeed have utility as a predictive biomarker. In particular, the results of the prospective phase II randomized trial currently evaluating the stratification of patients with nonsquamous NSCLC to pemetrexed-based or gemcitabine-based therapy according to tumour TS expression levels are expected in 2014 and are eagerly awaited.^{139}

Several clinical trials have prospectively evaluated whether 5-FU-refractory patients with CRC and high levels of intratumoural TS expression could be resensitized to 5-FU by exploiting the molecular phenomenon whereby histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors induce the downregulation of TS protein levels.^{140} On the whole, these trials found that the HDAC inhibitor vorinostat did not consistently decrease intratumoural TS expression and, although incidences of stable disease were observed,^{141,142} enthusiasm to pursue this approach has diminished.

### Inhibition of dUTPase activity

As mentioned earlier, the uracil-misincorporation pathway is well established as an important determinant of cytotoxicity resulting from TS inhibition. As the pyrophosphatase enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of dUTP to dUMP, dUTPase protects tumour DNA from the detrimental effects of misincorporation of uracil (Figure 4).^{143,144} Indeed, dUTPase is overexpressed in a number of cancers that are treated with TS-targeted therapies, including CRCs, NSCLCs, and breast cancers, and thus inhibition of this enzyme represents a viable approach to augment the efficacy of TS-targeted therapies.^{144–147} Consistent with this hypothesis, numerous studies have reported that inhibition of dUTPase greatly sensitizes multiple cancer types to both fluoropyrimidine-induced and antifolate-induced TS inhibition through potentiation of the uracil-misincorporation pathway and subsequent synthetic lethality.^{144,145,148–151} In 2012, potent uracil-derivative dUTPase inhibitors with promising pharmacological properties were reported to demonstrate synergism with fluoropyrimidine-based TS inhibitors in preclinical *in vitro* and *in vivo* models, without any detectable increase in the toxicity associated with TS inhibition.^{151} One of these dUTPase inhibitors, TAS-114, has been investigated in a first-in-human trial,^{152} which demonstrated that this agent has both a favourable safety profile and encouraging pharmacokinetic characteristics. TAS-114 is currently entering clinical investigation in combination with S-1^{153} and capecitabine^{154} in patients with advanced-stage solid tumours (Figure 1; Table 2). The identification of potent and specific inhibitors of dUTPase represents a potentially transformative milestone for the future of TS-targeted therapies, which could lead to mechanism-based synthetic lethal strategies that target the uracil-misincorporation pathway in tumour cells.

### The potential involvement of UMP–CMP kinase

Other fluoropyrimidine metabolic enzymes have been implicated in resistance to 5-FU. In particular, resistance of CRC cells to 5-FU administered *in vitro* to simulate a bolus regimen was associated with decreased expression
of UMP–CMP kinase (UMP–CMPK), an enzyme that has an important role in the activation of 5-FU to FUTP and, therefore, incorporation of 5-FU into RNA (Figure 3).<sup>155</sup> This preclinical observation was recapitulated in clinical specimens from patients resistant to bolus 5-FU regimens in the absence of any differences in the activities of other 5-FU-metabolizing enzymes, including TS and DPD.<sup>155</sup> Thus, low tumour expression of UMP–CMPK might preclude patients from bolus 5-FU-containing therapeutic regimens, owing to the high likelihood of attenuated RNA-related cytotoxicity. However, further studies are needed to clarify the predictive potential of UMP–CMPK expression.

### Abrogation of DNA repair mechanisms

Modulation of the pathways involved in the repair of DNA damage induced by TS-targeted chemotherapy represents an attractive target for improving drug efficacy.<sup>156</sup> The BER pathway is the primary mechanism involved in the repair of DNA damage induced by TS inhibitors.<sup>157</sup> DNA-apurinic–apyrimidinic site lyase (also known as apurinic–apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 [APE-1]) is an enzyme that contributes to BER of damaged or mismatched nucleotides in DNA by creating a nick in the phosphodiester backbone at the apurinic–apyrimidinic (AP) site created by UDG-mediated removal of the damaged base.<sup>158</sup> APE-1 is frequently overexpressed in various types of tumour and is reported to contribute to chemotherapy resistance.<sup>159–161</sup> In support of a role of this enzyme in drug resistance, preclinical studies using antisense RNA interference (RNAi) or small-molecule inhibitors have demonstrated that inactivation of APE-1 renders cells sensitive to structurally-diverse DNA-damaging agents.<sup>162,163</sup> One of the more clinically advanced agents that can disrupt the ability of APE-1 to repair DNA damage is methoxyamine, a compound that reacts with and covalently modifies AP sites;<sup>164</sup> methoxyamine-modified AP sites are resistant to cleavage by APE-1, and without APE-1-dependent cleavage of the phosphodiester backbone the subsequent processing of AP sites by other BER enzymes is prevented.<sup>165–167</sup> Thus, methoxyamine can potentiate the cytotoxicity of structurally diverse chemotherapeutics that cause incorporation of atypical bases into DNA, including TS inhibitors such as pemetrexed, FdUrd and 5-FU.<sup>165–167</sup> In such instances, the increased cytotoxicity observed has been attributed directly to the accumulation of unrepaired AP sites.<sup>165–167</sup> In a phase I trial (Table 2),<sup>168</sup> a decrease in detectable AP sites was reported in patients with solid tumours who were treated with methoxyamine (TRC102) in combination with pemetrexed, providing strong evidence of *in vivo* target engagement, and clinical response (stable disease) was observed in 60% of patients; one individual with recurrent metastatic oropharyngeal carcinoma and high levels of TS expression achieved a partial response and was progression free for 14 months.<sup>168</sup> These findings suggest that methoxyamine holds future promise as another rational mechanism-based strategy to enhance the efficacy of TS inhibitors. A large number of small-molecule inhibitors of APE-1 have also been developed, however, the potency and selectivity of many of these agents remains unclear at present.<sup>162</sup>

UDG, the primary DNA glycosylase responsible for the removal of uracil residues from DNA in humans,<sup>70</sup> mediates the first activating step in BER. Misincorporated genomic uracil resulting from TS inhibition induces DNA damage and early cell-cycle arrest as a result of BER activity,<sup>71</sup> and is a critical determinant of sensitivity to pemetrexed-based TS inhibition in lung-cancer cells.<sup>144,169</sup> UDG expression varies widely in lung cancers, but overexpression of this enzyme is associated with resistance to pemetrexed-related cytotoxicity in clinical specimens and chronically exposed cell-line models.<sup>170</sup> Importantly, RNAi was used to target UDG, and this intervention sensitized lung-cancer cells to the cytotoxicity of uracil misincorporation.<sup>166,169</sup> Although this therapeutic approach remains in early stages of development, UDG could potentially represent a novel target in the BER pathway, inhibition of which might augment cytotoxicity induced by TS-targeted agents.

Inhibition of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1), a key factor in the early recognition of DNA single-strand breaks that occur as a result of TS inhibition, has also emerged as a potential intervention point in the BER pathway. As a sensor of DNA damage, PARP1 is rapidly recruited to the damaged DNA and catalyses the synthesis of protein-conjugated long branched poly(ADP-ribose) chains on key proteins involved in DNA repair,<sup>171,172</sup> and thus facilitates the association and assembly of the BER machinery. Preclinical data suggest that CRCs and ovarian cancers could be susceptible to PARP1 inhibition when combined with TS-targeted therapies such as FdUrd, but interestingly not with 5-FU.<sup>174,175</sup> This finding is indicative of possible differences in the profile of DNA damage caused by these agents or their metabolites. Preventing the early PARP1-mediated detection and signalling of DNA single-strand breaks and, therefore, delaying or preventing repair of these breaks might enhance the cytotoxicity of DNA damage induced by TS-targeted therapies. Clinical trials evaluating PARP inhibitors in combination with capecitabine-based and 5-FU-based therapeutic regimens are ongoing in patients with pancreatic and rectal cancers.<sup>176,177</sup>

### Conclusions

Despite being one of the earliest approaches to cancer chemotherapy, the inhibition of thymidylate biosynthesis and disruption of tumour DNA replication continues to stand the test of time as a widely employed and successful strategy in cancer therapeutics. Not only do agents targeting these processes remain integral components in some of the most important therapeutic regimens presently used in the treatment of various cancers, but such agents have also received additional approvals for new indications, profoundly altering the clinical landscape in some of the most difficult-to-treat cancers within the past 5–10 years. These new indications continue to capitalize on the underlying molecular mechanisms that form the basis of the strong synergistic interactions between TS inhibitors and other DNA-directed chemotherapies. Furthermore, an improved understanding of the nucleotide-biosynthesis and DNA-repair pathways at the molecular level has led to the clinical development of new agents, such as the fluoropyrimidine
TAS-102 (TFT) and inhibitors of dUTPase (TAS-114), that are currently in clinical evaluation, ${}^{117,152}$ and hold considerable therapeutic promise. Further research efforts are clearly required and must continue to focus on understanding the potential mechanisms by which tumours develop resistance to both existing and new TS-targeted agents. Such studies will provide an important foundation for the rational design of novel therapeutic strategies to anticipate and prevent the development of drug resistance, or overcome resistance effectively when it inevitably arises. Until such times as the promise of targeted therapy in cancer therapeutics becomes more tractable beyond small subsets of patients, effective TS-inhibitor-based chemotherapeutic strategies will remain among the most-effective treatments and provide the best survival advantage in some of the most-difficult-to-treat cancers.
