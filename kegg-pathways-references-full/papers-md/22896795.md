junctions;¹² in vertebrates, Dlg1-4 are associated with both presynaptic and postsynaptic membranes, which are the most apical membrane-like domains of neurons in the brain.¹³

In vertebrates, deciphering Scrib/Lgl Dlg functions in apical-basal polarity establishment is challenging due to gene duplication during evolution, as one Scribble but two Lgls (Lgl1 and Lgl2) and four Dlgs (Dlg1 through 4) orthologs have been identified.¹⁴ The Dlgs belong to the MAGUK (Membrane Associated Guanylateancestor. Dlg3 is located in the cytoplasm and along the cell membrane, with a peak in distribution at the level of the apical membrane. These observations strongly contrast with the idea that the Dlgs function exclusively at the basolateral membrane, a hypothesis that is based on studies of Dlg in *Drosophila*. In the brain, the Dlgs cluster at synapses in the presynaptic active zone and postsynaptic densities (PSD) in a highly dynamic manner, both spatially and temporally.²²

Important clues to understanding the mechanisms of Dlg3-mediated cell polarity and junction establishment came from the analysis
