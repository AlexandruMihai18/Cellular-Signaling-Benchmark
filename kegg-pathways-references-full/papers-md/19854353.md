Despite the existence of effective vaccines, HBV infection remains a major health problem with 2 billion people infected worldwide. Among them, 350 million are chronically infected, a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). There is a strong need to develop new and efficient treatments against chronic infection and HCC. It is therefore important to understand HBV replication and persistence as well as the role of HBV in liver carcinogenesis. This chapter focuses on the regulatory protein HBx which is thought to play a central role in HBV regulation and pathogenesis. HBx has been shown to modulate a myriad of viral and cellular functions, yet its role in virus replication and pathogenesis in infected individuals remains far from being completely understood. © 2009 Elsevier Inc.  

I. INTRODUCTION  

The human hepatitis B virus (HBV) is the prototype member of a family of small, enveloped DNA virus called hepadnaviruses. These viruses can infect mammals and birds, they display narrow host range, and they infect hepatocytes preferentially. Hepadnaviruses share similar virion structure and relaxed circular, partially double-stranded DNA genome (RC-DNA) that is

replicated via an RNA intermediate (Wei and Tiollais, 1999). After entry into hepatocytes, HBV RC-DNA is transported to the nucleus and converted into a covalently closed circular molecule: cccDNA (Beck and Nassal, 2007; Mason et al., 1980; Weiser et al., 1983). cccDNA is the template for the transcription of subgenomic RNAs as well as the pregenomic RNA (pgRNA). In the cytoplasm, pgRNA is then selectively packaged into progeny capsids and reverse transcribed by the viral polymerase into relaxed circular DNA (RC-DNA). Capsids containing mature RC-DNA are either used for intracellular cccDNA amplification or for assembly with the viral envelope in the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to the formation of the viral particles that will be released from the cell (Wei and Tiollais, 1999) (Fig. 1).

Upon HBV infection, the majority of infected patients have subclinical disease and only one-third will experience acute hepatitis with 0–1%

Fig. 1 HBV life cycle. After attachment, the nucleocapsid is released into the cytosol and the viral genomic DNA is transported to the nucleus where the virion DNA is repaired and converted to covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA). The cccDNA is the template for transcription of all viral RNAs. The pregenome RNA is encapsidated into core particles, along with the HBV polymerase. The polymerase synthesizes a negative-strand DNA copy and degrades the RNA template. Positive-strand DNA synthesis begins within the intact core but is only partially completed. With completion of 50% or more of the plus strand, nucleocapsids are packaged into envelopes by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum. Alternatively, nucleocapsids may also migrate to the nucleus to facilitate production of additional cccDNA.

developing fulminant hepatitis. Whereas most patients will then clear the virus, a significant proportion will develop chronic hepatitis as a result of the failure of the host immune response against the virus. Despite the existence of effective vaccines, it has been estimated that 350 million people are chronically infected worldwide. Epidemiological studies have established that persistent HBV infection is a major risk factor for the development of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and HBV is now thought to be one of the most important environmental carcinogen for humans (Parkin *et al.*, 2001; Szmuness, 1978).

Because of the increasing number of chronic HBV carriers and the poor prognosis of HCC, there is an urgent need to fully understand the mechanism of HBV replication as well as the mechanism of cancer liver development. This chapter will focus on HBx, a regulatory protein that is essential for virus replication. HBx, in order to favor virus replication, has been shown to subvert cellular activities such as signal transduction, transcription, and proliferation. In doing so, HBx might induce the accumulation of dysfunctions and alterations in the cell ultimately leading, in the case of viral persistence, to cancer development.

## II. IS HBx AN ESSENTIAL OR ACCESSORY REGULATORY PROTEIN FOR VIRUS REPLICATION?

Sequencing of the HBV genome, and then of woodchuck (WHV) and ground squirrel (GSHV) hepatitis virus genomes, allowed the identification of four open reading frames (Fig. 2). The pre-S/S ORF encodes three viral surface proteins; the pre-C/C ORF encodes the hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and the structural protein of the core: hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg); the P gene encodes the viral polymerase. Finally, the smallest ORF, which was named X because it shares no homology with any known gene, encodes a 154 amino acid polypeptide called HBx. This protein is produced at very low level during acute and chronic hepatitis and induces humoral and cellular immune responses (Chun *et al.*, 2003; Chung *et al.*, 1999; Hwang *et al.*, 2002; Malmassari *et al.*, 2005). Interestingly, this ORF is present in all mammalian hepadnaviruses but is absent in avian viruses, although HBx expression appears to be required for viral infection and replication. It was first suggested that the X gene product was essential for virus replication *in vivo* since WHV genomes deficient for the expression of WHx cannot replicate in the woodchuck host (Chen *et al.*, 1993; Zoulim *et al.*, 1994). Using a similar model, others have found that such mutant viruses are still able to replicate, albeit at low level (Zhang *et al.*, 2001). However, WHV revertants expressing a wild-type WHx protein eventually emerged, pointing

The *cis* elements that regulate HBV transcription are represented by oval and rectangular symbols. PreS1 promoter (PreS1 P), PreS2 promoter (PreS2 P), core promoter (CP) and X promoter (XP), and Enhancer I (Enh I) and Enhancer II (Enh II) are shown.

out the importance of a wild-type WHx for full replication. This observation is supported by a recent study using hydrodynamic injection in mice showing that an HBx-deficient HBV genome is strongly compromised for HBV replication (Keasler et al., 2007). HBx expression in this model was able to restore virus replication and viremia to wild-type levels. Similarly, transgenic mice constitutively expressing the wild-type HBV genome or a mutant genome that cannot express HBx shows that HBx increases virus replication even if it is not essential for the virus life cycle (Xu et al., 2002). These results highlight the need to study HBx activity in a context of virus replication closely recapitulating the *in vivo* setting. This discrepancy could be due to a difference in virus transcription between an integrated genome versus the cccDNA or to a difference in the host immune response. The same difficulty in assessing the role of HBx in virus life cycle was encountered when studying replication in tissue culture. Indeed, it has been shown that
HBx-deficient HBV genomes are still able to replicate in the Huh7 cell line, while viral replication is strongly reduced in HepG2 cells using the same construct (Bouchard et al., 2001b; Keasler et al., 2007; Leupin et al., 2005; Melegari et al., 1998; Tang et al., 2005). Except for the study of WHV in the living host, the role of HBx during the complete virus life cycle has not been assessed, which impedes a comprehensive view of the role of this protein. Given this limitation, most studies however strongly support the importance of HBx in the virus life cycle. Yet the functions supplied by HBx in virus replication still need to be fully elucidated.

# III. HBx: A POTENTIAL CANDIDATE IN HCC DEVELOPMENT

The evidence for a role of HBx in the development of HBV-associated pathogenesis and liver cancer came first from indirect proof. Indeed, anti-HBx antibodies are frequently detected in chronic HBsAg carriers showing markers of active viral replication and chronic liver disease, and in HCC patients (Hwang et al., 2003; Levrero et al., 1991; Vitvitski-Trepo et al., 1990; Zhu et al., 1993). In HBV-associated HCC, viral DNA sequences have been found in integrated state in 85–90% of cases. While these genomes are incomplete and often rearranged, the X gene is frequently conserved and HBx expression is preferentially maintained in HCC (Hwang et al., 2003; Paterlini et al., 1995; Peng et al., 2005; Su et al., 1998). Interestingly, different studies report the transcription of the X gene with a deletion in the C-terminal portion subsequent to the integration of the HBV genome (Iavarone et al., 2003; Sirma et al., 1999; Tu et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2004b; Wei et al., 1995; Wollersheim et al., 1988). While some studies concluded that truncated mutants retain transcriptional transactivation ability, others found that HBx mutants have lost most of the activities associated with wild-type HBx, in particular that they can enhance (instead of inhibit) the transforming activity of Ras and Myc (Tu et al., 2001). It remains unclear however whether these mutants play a role in HCC development during HBV infection. It will be interesting to determine if they play a role in the first stages of oncogenesis, or if they emerge later on during tumor progression, allowing full cellular transformation or providing an additional step in the transformation process.

The role of HBx in tumorigenesis has also been studied more directly using animal and cell culture models, but results remain controversial. It has been shown that HBx is able to transform several cell lines such as the NIH3T3 and Rev-2 rodent cell lines expressing the simian virus 40 large tumor antigen (SV40TAg) (Gottlob et al., 1998; Seifer et al., 1991). In agreementwith these reports, HBx has been reported to cooperate with Ras in the transformation of NIH3T3 and immortalized rodent cells (Kim *et al.*, 2001). In contrast, other laboratories have reported that HBx can suppress transformation of primary rat embryo fibroblasts or of NIH3T3 cells transformed by different oncogenes due to induction of apoptosis (Kim *et al.*, 1998; Schuster *et al.*, 2000). The oncogenic potential of HBx has also been assessed in transgenic mouse models, giving rise again to divergent results. These studies have been carried out in mice generated from different genetic background, and HBx expression was controlled either by its natural HBV enhancer/promoter sequences or by heterologous liver-specific promoters (Koike, 2002). Development of HCC associated with HBx expression has been essentially described for a transgenic mouse line generated in the outbred CD-1 background and expressing high level of HBx in the liver (Kim *et al.*, 1991; Koike *et al.*, 1994a). In other transgenic lineages, expression of HBx by itself does not lead to HCC development (Billet *et al.*, 1995; Perfumo *et al.*, 1992). It is thus possible that the X gene used to generate the transgenic mice as well as the lifelong expression of HBx could impact on the development of HCC (Koike, 2002). However, even if further studies are needed to confirm that HBx can directly induce transformation in mice, its role as a cofactor of carcinogenesis is well accepted. It has been shown, for example, that HBx cooperates with *c-myc* or with chemical carcinogens in hepatocarcinogenesis (Slagle *et al.*, 1996; Terradillos *et al.*, 1997). It has also been reported that HBx expression induces the development of HCC in p21-deficient mice (Wang *et al.*, 2004a). How HBx operates in cellular transformation remains however unclear. HBx is a multifunctional protein exhibiting numerous activities affecting gene transcription, intracellular signal transduction, cell proliferation, apoptotic cell death, and DNA repair that are described in this chapter (Fig. 3). Any or all of these multiple activities could contribute to hepatocarcinogenesis.

## IV. HBx: STRUCTURAL AND BIOCHEMICAL FEATURES

Little is known about the three-dimensional structure and the biochemical features of the HBx protein due to the difficulty to produce sufficient amounts of soluble protein. The X ORF codes for a protein of approximately 17 kDa that shows only weak sequence homology with known structural motives or proteins. Sequences analysis of HBx proteins from mammalian hepadnaviruses allowed the identification of highly conserved regions (residues 1–20, 58–84, and 120–140) interspaced by less conserved regions (21–57, 85–119, and 141–154) (Kumar and Sarkar, 2004). Although the domain 85–119 seems to be poorly conserved, it contains the minimal
Hepatitis B Virus X Protein

Fig. 3 Multiple functions of the regulatory protein. The figure illustrates the complexity of the biological activities of HBx. HBx activates transcription through direct binding to transcription factors, coactivators, and components of the basal transcription machinery. HBx transcriptional activity is also linked to its capacity to stimulate MAPKs and JAK/STAT signaling pathways. Activation of these pathways is indirect and HBx is thought to trigger the release of calcium into the cytosol, which in turn activates the Pyk2/FAK and Src kinase families. Activated Src kinases stimulate in turn a variety of signaling pathways leading, for example, to the activation of transcription factors. HBx interacts with different cellular partners such as CRM1, p53, mitochondria, proteasome, and DDB1 that are involved in HBx activities and could stimulate both HBV replication and be relevant to cell transformation.

domain required for DDB1 binding. This minimal domain is relatively well conserved and seems to adopt a helix structure found in HBx and WHx, as well as in DDB2, a known DDB1-interacting partner (Bergametti et al., 2002a; Scrima et al., 2008). In an attempt to define the structure of HBx by spectroscopic assays, Rui et al. (2005) used a version of HBx deleted of its N-terminal cysteines and concluded that HBx appears as an unstructured protein that can gain secondary structure under specific conditions. HBx might be folded and acquire specific function through its interaction with target proteins, and this flexibility could account for the large array of HBx activities (Rui et al., 2005). However, analysis of the structure of HBx produced either from E. coli or insect cells, suggested that the cysteines present in HBx form internal disulfide bonds *in vivo* (Lin and Lo, 1989;

Urban *et al.*, 1997). Finally, a report suggests that cysteine residues present in the N-terminal third of HBx could rather be involved in the dimerization of HBx (Gupta *et al.*, 1995). However, the homodimerization domain has been mapped by Murakami *et al.* (1994) in the Ser/Pro-rich region at amino acids 21–50, as part of the negative regulatory domain. The question of whether the N-terminal part is involved in oligomerization, and the role of dimerization in HBx activity warrants further studies.

The localization of HBx remains also a matter of debate. Some studies showed a cytoplasmic localization, whereas others found that the protein is preferentially nuclear, or present both in the cytoplasm and the nucleus (Doria *et al.*, 1995; Schek *et al.*, 1991; Sirma *et al.*, 1998a; Weil *et al.*, 1999). Divergent data were also obtained when studying the expression of HBx in infected hepatocytes (Dandri *et al.*, 1998; Hoare *et al.*, 2001; Su *et al.*, 1998). As a possible explanation to these seemingly contradictory findings, studies from different laboratories have shown that HBx expressed at very low level is predominantly nuclear, whereas high levels of HBx lead to cytoplasmic accumulation (Cha *et al.*, 2009; Henkler *et al.*, 2001). Interestingly, Cha and collaborators reported that both cytoplasmic and nuclear HBx participate in HBV replication (Cha *et al.*, 2009; Henkler *et al.*, 2001). A recent publication from Keasler *et al.* (2009) using a cell culture and a mouse models confirmed the importance of nuclear HBx for restoring the replication of HBx-deficient virus. Altogether, these results argue in favor of a dual localization of HBx consistent with its pleiotropic activities. The localization of HBx during virus replication could fluctuate depending on HBx concentration, but also on the accessibility of cellular partners involved in its nuclear import and export. Indeed, HBx has been shown to bind IkB-α that is, in turn, involved in its nuclear translocation (Weil *et al.*, 1999). Another group reported that HBx interacts with CRM1 and that the cytoplasmic localization of HBx is sensitive to drugs inhibiting CRM1 activity (Forgues *et al.*, 2001).

The dual localization of HBx is consistent with the finding that HBx turnover follows a bimodal kinetic of 20 min and 3 h. The pool of HBx associated with the cytoplasmic fraction appears to decrease much more rapidly than the nuclear and cytoskeleton-associated fraction (Dandri *et al.*, 1998; Schek *et al.*, 1991). To date, the reason for the slower decay of the nuclear fraction remains unknown. A work of Bergametti *et al.* (2002b) showed that the binding of HBx to DDB1 protects the viral protein from degradation. This interaction occurs preferentially in the nucleus and might account for the prolonged half-life (Bontron *et al.*, 2002). HBx turnover has been shown to be both ubiquitin-dependent and ubiquitin-independent (Hu *et al.*, 1999; Kim *et al.*, 2008a). It is however not known whether the two phases of HBx degradation are both ubiquitin-dependent. The E3 ubiquitin ligase regulating HBx turnover remains also unidentified. Id-1 has
been shown to stimulate HBx degradation by facilitating the interaction of HBx with the proteasome (Ling et al., 2008). However, it is not clear whether this process is mediated via the ubiquitination of HBx. The HBV core protein and the cellular protein p53 have also been shown to increase HBx degradation in an indirect fashion (Kim et al., 2003; Park et al., 2009).

Finally, HBx has been shown to be subjected to other posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation and acetylation (Schek et al., 1991; Urban et al., 1999). Acetylation occurs at the amino terminus and has been observed only in insect cells (Urban et al., 1999). Phosphorylation of HBx has been described in human hepatoblastoma cells as well as in insect cells and it has been shown that HBx can be phosphorylated *in vitro* by protein kinase C and mitogen-activated kinase (Lee et al., 2001b; Schek et al., 1991; Urban et al., 1999). The relevance of these modifications for HBx activities remains however poorly understood. Noh et al. (2004) proposed that HBx is phosphorylated by the extracellular–response kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2), which induces its nuclear translocation. It has recently been shown that the peptidyl propyl isomerase Pin1 interacts specifically with phosphorylated HBx and increases its stability, which correlates with enhanced HBx transcriptional activity and HBx-induced tumor development (Pang et al., 2007). The significance of this interaction for HBx activities remains unclear since a mutant that cannot interact with Pin1 does activate transcription and cell proliferation to the same extent as wild-type HBx. However, the finding that this mutant has reduced capacity to induce tumor development compared to the wild-type protein argues for a role of Pin1 in HBx-induced carcinogenesis *in vivo*. Whether Pin1 is only involved in HBx stability or involved in other functions will need to be clarified.

## V. HBx ACTIVITIES

### A. Transactivation Mechanism of HBx

Transcriptional activation was one of the first functions attributed to HBx (Tiollais et al., 1981). This activity is believed to be crucial for the development of liver cancer because it is involved in HBV transcription/replication (Chou et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2005), as well as in upregulation of a large number of cellular genes involved in oncogenesis, proliferation, inflammation, and immune response (Avantaggiati et al., 1993; Balsano et al., 1991; Cougot et al., 2007; Kim et al., 1996; Lara-Pezzi et al., 1998b; Mahe et al., 1991; Majano et al., 2001; Menzo et al., 1993; Robinson et al., 1993; Twu et al., 1993; Wu et al., 2001; Yen, 1996; Zhou et al., 1990). HBx has been shown to activate the expression of genes involved in cellular proliferation,such as c-jun, c-fos, PCNA, cyclin D1, or in angiogenesis, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and IL8 (Avantaggiati *et al.*, 1993; Cougot *et al.*, 2007; Mahe *et al.*, 1991; Park *et al.*, 2006; Robinson *et al.*, 1993; Twu *et al.*, 1993; Yoo *et al.*, 2003). HBx induces TGF-$\beta$, a cytokine that plays a major role in hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis (Yoo *et al.*, 1996). Accordingly, Martin-Vilchez *et al.* (2008) have shown that HBx induces activation of hepatic stellate cells and subsequent amplification of fibrosis through the induction of TGF-$\beta$. Interestingly, HBx is able to amplify TGF-$\beta$ signaling by increasing Smad4 transcriptional activity (Lee *et al.*, 2001a). HBx also increases hepatic steatosis through the induction of SREBP1 and PPAR$\gamma$ expression and transcriptional activation of hepatic adipogenic and lipogenic target genes (Kim *et al.*, 2007a). HBx could also participate in hepatocarcinogenesis by modifying gene expression through epigenetic mechanisms. HBx upregulates the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1, DNMT3A1, and DNMT3A2 leading to an increase in their enzymatic activity. HBx might thus act at the epigenetic level, inducing regional hypermethylation leading to inactivation of genes such as E-cadherin (Lee *et al.*, 2005) or tumor suppressor genes such as p16INK4A (Jung *et al.*, 2007; Park *et al.*, 2007). Recently, HBx has also been shown to be involved in autophagy through the induction of beclin 1 expression (Tang *et al.*, 2009). Global approaches using cDNA microarray, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) or combination of chip-based chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP on chip) techniques clearly illustrate the ability of HBx to promiscuously activate a myriad of promoters and thus deregulate a large number of cellular genes (Hu *et al.*, 2006; Wu *et al.*, 2001, 2002; Zhang *et al.*, 2009).

Although HBx is described as a weak transactivator, it is capable of activating a wide range of cellular and viral promoters dependent on Polymerase I, II, or III, including the HBV promoters and enhancers (Kumar and Sarkar, 2004; Rossner, 1992; Wang *et al.*, 1995, 1997, 1998; Yen, 1996). HBx activates transcription via several DNA sites such as the binding sites for NF-$\kappa$B, AP-1, c-EBP, ATF/CREB, SP1, HIF-$\alpha$, E2F, and NF-AT (Choi *et al.*, 2001; Kumar and Sarkar, 2004; Rossner, 1992; Wang *et al.*, 1995, 1997, 1998; Yen, 1996). HBx does not directly bind DNA and thus, various mechanisms have been described to explain this pleiotropic transcriptional activation, including direct interaction with nuclear transcriptional regulators and activation of cytosolic signal transduction pathways.

HBx has been shown to interact with components of the basal transcriptional machinery (TFIIB, TFIIH, RPB5, and TBP) (Cheong *et al.*, 1995; Haviv *et al.*, 1998a,b; Lin *et al.*, 1997; Qadri *et al.*, 1995) or with transcription factors (CREB/ATF, ATF2, C/EBP$\alpha$, ATF3, NF-IL-6, Oct1, SMAD4, and SREBP1) (Barnabas and Andrisani, 2000; Choi *et al.*, 1999; Kim *et al.*, 2007a; Lee *et al.*, 2001a; Maguire *et al.*, 1991; Natoli *et al.*, 1994a), as wellas coactivators (Cougot *et al.*, 2007). The activation of CREB/ATF transcriptional activity by HBx appears to result from dual mechanisms, since HBx has been shown to increase CREB/ATF DNA-binding affinity and to enhance the recruitment of CBP/p300 to CREB/ATF bound to endogenous cellular DNA (Barnabas *et al.*, 1997; Cougot *et al.*, 2007). The modulation of CREB/ATF activity by HBx might represent an important aspect of HBx activities since the CREB/ATF family members play an essential role in liver metabolism and proliferation. Recently, CREB has also been implicated in hepatocarcinogenesis (Abramovitch *et al.*, 2004). Moreover, this activity could also be involved in the activation of HBV transcription mediated by HBx, since a CREB-binding site-like sequence (CRE) is present in the HBV enhancer 1 and in PreS2 (Tacke *et al.*, 2005; Trujillo *et al.*, 1991). Further studies will be needed to investigate the respective role of CREB and of coactivators such as CBP/p300 in the activation of HBV replication by HBx. CBP/p300 are known to bind and activate a large variety of cellular transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, and NF-κB. In a recent analysis of hepatic steatosis, Na *et al.* (2009) showed that HBx increased liver X receptor (LXR) transcriptional activity through direct binding and suggested that HBx could act by increasing the recruitment of CBP to LRX bound to its target promoter. Interaction of HBx with coactivators could thus explain partially the broad activity of HBx on transcription. Kong *et al.* (2003) reported an interaction between HBx and the cancer-amplified transcription coactivator (ASC-2), suggesting a role of HBx in the assembly of the enhancosome and its activity. Binding sites for some of the HBx-interacting partners have been identified, and the domain necessary for transactivation has been mapped between amino acids 52 and 148, with the last 13 C-terminal amino acids (149–154) of HBx being dispensable and the first 50 N-terminal amino acids behaving as a negative regulatory region (Kumar and Sarkar, 2004).

A second important mechanism for HBx transcriptional activity is linked to its capacity to activate signal transduction pathways. This function is mediated by the cytoplasmic pool of HBx (Bouchard and Schneider, 2004). HBx has been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways including the extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERKs), the stress-activated protein kinases/NH2-terminal jun kinases and the p38 kinase, and janus family of tyrosine kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathways (Benn and Schneider, 1994; Benn *et al.*, 1996; Cross *et al.*, 1993; Doria *et al.*, 1995; Klein and Schneider, 1997; Lee and Yun, 1998; Natoli *et al.*, 1994b; Su and Schneider, 1996b; Tarn *et al.*, 2001, 2002). Activation of these pathways by HBx is dependent on the activation of nonreceptor tyrosine kinases of the Src family, since inhibition of Src kinases prevents the activation of the Ras–Raf–MAP kinase, JNK, p38 MAPK, or JAK/STAT pathways (Klein and Schneider, 1997; Tarn
et al., 2002). However, alternative activation of the JAK/STAT signaling pathway mediated through a direct interaction between HBx and JAK1 has also been described (Lee and Yun, 1998). NF-$\kappa$B, an important mediator of the cellular stress responses that control the expression of several acute phase response proteins, cytokines, and adhesion molecules, is among the factors or functions modulated by HBx through the activation of the MAPK pathways (Doria et al., 1995; Ghosh et al., 1998; Su and Schneider, 1996a). Activation of NF-$\kappa$B is Src- and Ras-dependent and results from phosphorylation and degradation of the NF-$\kappa$B inhibitor IkB-$\alpha$ as well as downregulation of p105 NF-$\kappa$B1 inhibitor, leading to nuclear translocation of NF-$\kappa$B (Su and Schneider, 1996b). Ras-independent pathways are also suspected to be involved in NF-$\kappa$B activation, such as sequestration of newly synthesized IkB-$\alpha$ by HBx leading to the sustained activation of NF-$\kappa$B (Chirillo et al., 1996; Weil et al., 1999). Expression of the hypoxia-inducible factor 1$\alpha$ (HIF-1$\alpha$) as well as its target gene VEGF has been shown to be increased in HBx-transgenic mice. Yoo et al. (2003) showed that HBx stabilizes and activates HIF-1$\alpha$ through the activation of the MAPK pathways. Recently however, the same authors reported that HBx also activates HIF-1$\alpha$ via the induction of MTA1 and HDAC1, two proteins known to modulate HIF-1$\alpha$ activity. Moreover, they reported that HBx interacts with HIF1-$\alpha$ in the nucleus, though the role of this interaction in the formation of the HIF-1$\alpha$/MAT1/HDAC1 complex and the deacetylation of HIF-1$\alpha$ was not assessed (Yoo et al., 2008). HIF-1$\alpha$ has been shown to be upregulated in a large number of tumors and is associated with tumor progression. Its upregulation in HBx-transgenic mice suggests that HIF-1$\alpha$ plays a role in HBx-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Another mechanism triggered by HBx-induced Src activation might be transcriptional activation of the androgen receptor (AR) (Chiu et al., 2007; Yang et al., 2009). The effect of HBx on AR transcriptional activity was found to be dependent on androgen concentration. This interesting finding sheds light on the observed predominance of HCC in HBV-infected males. Of note, HBx also enhances AR dimerization and activation by inhibiting glycogen synthase kinase-3$\beta$ (GSK-3$\beta$). Inactivation of GSK-3$\beta$ by HBx and subsequent activation of the Wnt/$\beta$-catenin pathway have been previously reported. In this case, HBx has been shown to activate Wnt/$\beta$-catenin signaling through the activation of Src kinase or ERK (Cha et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2005). This finding could be of significant importance for hepatocarcinogenesis. Indeed, abnormal activation of the Wnt signaling pathway is associated with the development of different tumors such as HCC (de La Coste et al., 1998; Polakis, 2000). It has also been shown that HBx causes activation of the transcription factor AP-1 through the Ras–RAF–MAPK and JNK pathways (Benn and Schneider, 1994; Benn et al., 1996; Bouchard et al., 2006; Cross et al., 1993; Natoli et al., 1994b). Some studies have reported that activation of diacylglycerol-dependent protein kinase C is responsible for HBx induction of AP1 and NF-$\kappa$B activity
(Kekulé et al., 1993; Luber et al., 1993), but it was not confirmed in other studies (Lucito and Schneider, 1992). Finally, Ras signaling is also involved in the stimulation of RNA pol I- and pol III-dependent transcription (Johnson et al., 2000; Wang et al., 1997, 1998). Importantly, HBx activation of MAPKs and JNKs has been demonstrated in HBx-transduced mouse liver. Such constitutive activation is associated with increased activity of AP-1 (Nijhara et al., 2001).

Additionally, activation of Src kinases by HBx has been involved in HBx activities that are not linked to its transcriptional function, such as HBx effects on destabilization of cellular adherent junctions through Src activation (Lara-Pezzi et al., 2001). Disruption of intercellular adhesion might represent a mechanism by which HBx contributes to the development of liver cancer. Finally, activation of Src kinases by HBx has been shown to stimulate HBV replication at the level of DNA replication (Bouchard et al., 2003, 2006; Klein et al., 1999). Notably, these studies emphasized that HBx might stimulate the viral polymerase activity rather than acting at a transcriptional level. Recently, Melegari et al. (2005) showed that HBx stimulates core phosphorylation, which correlates with an increase of HBV DNA synthesis. Whether this activity needs Src activation awaits being determined. Using a similar construct, other studies have however shown that HBx also acts at the transcriptional level, suggesting a complex role of HBx on virus replication (Chou et al., 2005; Keasler et al., 2007; Leupin et al., 2005; Melegari et al., 2005).

HBx does not interact directly with Src kinases and recent studies from Bouchard and colleagues made a significant contribution to our understanding of Src activation by HBx. They showed that HBx induces the activation of upstream activators of Src kinases: the focal adhesion kinase (FAK) and the proline-rich tyrosine kinase (Pyk2) through the modulation of cytosolic calcium (Bouchard et al., 2001b, 2006). Direct measurement of cytosolic calcium in HBx-expressing cells confirmed that HBx expression correlates with an increase in cytosolic calcium (Chami et al., 2003; McClain et al., 2007). HBx might mediate this activity through its association with mitochondria (Clippinger and Bouchard, 2008; McClain et al., 2007). Studies from different groups showed that HBx associates with cell mitochondria, disrupts their architecture, and induces depolarization (Kim et al., 2007b; Shirakata and Koike, 2003; Takada et al., 1999). Interaction with mitochondria occurs in part via components of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) such as the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC3), which in turn deregulates MPTP function and influences cytosolic calcium level (McClain et al., 2007; Rahmani et al., 2000). A role of HBx and mitochondrial alterations in the deregulation of cytoplasmic calcium is supported by the results of Chami and collaborators showing that deregulation of calcium signaling is due both to a reduced uptake by mitochondria and to inactivation of the plasmamembrane calcium ATPase (PMCA). Moreover, interaction of HBx with mitochondria can lead to apoptosis (see Section V.D). The role of calcium as a mediator of HBx activities has been confirmed for the activation of the MAPK pathways, as well as for the activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NF-AT) (Lara-Pezzi et al., 1998a; Tarn et al., 2002). Interestingly, activation of NF-AT by HBx is dual. On one hand it is involved in the dephosphorylation and the nuclear translocation of NF-AT by a calcium/calcineurin-dependent mechanism. On the other hand, HBx acts at the nuclear level as a coactivator by interacting directly with the acidic transactivation domain of NF-AT, increasing its transcriptional activity (Canettieri et al., 2003). The importance of calcium signaling in virus replication has also been confirmed (Bouchard et al., 2001b, 2003). However, although calcium-mobilizing agents can rescue HBx-deficient HBV DNA replication to about 50% of the wild-type level, these compounds do not increase polymerase activity as HBx does (Bouchard et al., 2003). It is not known, for example, whether these compounds increase pgRNA encapsidation that could compensate for the defect of polymerase activity, since calcium has been shown to increase core assembly (Choi et al., 2005). These data argue that even if HBx needs calcium signaling for its activity, it probably has additional functions on virus replication.

Transactivation activity of HBx could therefore lead to the modulation of a large number of functions, such as virus replication, cell cycle regulation, angiogenesis, apoptosis, and DNA repair that could be relevant for cellular transformation.

### B. Additional Cellular Partners and Functions of HBx

Besides its interaction with transcription factors, coactivators or components of the basal transcription machinery, a myriad of HBx partners, including mitochondrial molecules, have been described that could be relevant for virus replication or oncogenesis, or both.

To evade apoptosis, viruses have evolved strategies allowing to circumvent this cellular response. Thus, viral transforming protein such as E6 from oncogenic papillomaviruses or large T from SV40 can suppress p53 function, allowing virally infected cells to evade apoptosis. HBx has been shown to interact *in vitro* and *in vivo* with the tumor suppressor p53 (Feitelson et al., 1993; Truant et al., 1995). Although this interaction remains controversial, it is thought to be involved in the inactivation of critical p53 activities. HBx has been reported to inhibit p53 sequence-specific DNA-binding (Wang et al., 1994). Chung et al. (2003) reported the downregulation of the tumor suppressor PTEN by HBx through repression of p53 transcriptional activity. Interestingly, p53 can bind to and repress HBVenhancer leading to the inhibition of HBV replication, and such repression can be relieved by HBx expression (Doitsh and Shaul, 1999; Ori et al., 1998). It has been proposed that HBx might interact with and sequester p53 in the cytoplasm, leading to its functional inactivation (Elmore et al., 1997b; Ueda et al., 1995), but other studies have failed to detect colocalization of p53 and HBx (Su et al., 2000). Functional inhibition of the tumor suppressor gene p53 is a common abnormality in human cancer cells. It is thus tempting to speculate that HBx, through p53 inactivation, participates to HCC development and to the high chromosomal instability of HBV-related tumors.

It has also been reported that HBx interacts with components of the proteasome such as PSMA7, an α subunit of the 20 S proteasome complex, or PSMC1, a subunit of the 19 S regulatory factor (Hu et al., 1999; Sirma et al., 1998b; Zhang et al., 2000). However, it remains unclear whether HBx inhibits proteasome activity or whether the proteasome is needed for HBx activity. Indeed, one study reported that inhibition of the proteasome impairs HBx transcriptional activity. In the same work, the authors showed that HBx inhibits proteasome-mediated proteolysis (Hu et al., 1999). A second study suggested that HBx might enhance HBV replication through proteasome inhibition (Zhang et al., 2004). The authors showed that proteasome inhibitors restored the replication of X-negative virus to the wild-type level, whereas they had no effect on the replication of the wild-type virus. In the context of virus replication, the effect of HBx as well as of proteasome inhibitors seems to be exerted at the posttranscriptional level. Finally, HBx has been shown to interfere with the ubiquitin degradation pathway and to block the degradation of c-Myc through a direct interaction with the F box region of Skp2 (Kalra and Kumar, 2006). Interestingly, dysregulation of protein degradation pathways is a common strategy used by viruses to provide a favorable environment for their replication, and to escape protective mechanisms developed by the host cell (Barry and Fruh, 2006). HBx interaction with DDB1, a core subunit of the Cul4A-based ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, has been very well documented. It has been shown that the HBx/DDB1 interaction is essential for virus replication and for the maintenance of HBx activities (Lee et al., 1995; Leupin et al., 2005; Lin-Marq et al., 2001; Rui et al., 2006; Sitterlin et al., 1997, 2000b). The precise role of DDB1 in HBx activities remains however unknown. DDB1 was first described as a protein involved in DNA repair (Chu and Chang, 1988). Thus, it was proposed that HBx impairs DNA repair through its interaction with DDB1. In vitro as well as in vivo studies led to conflicting results and the role of DDB1 in the inhibition of DNA repair by HBx has not been confirmed (Becker et al., 1998; Bergametti et al., 1999; Capovilla and Arbuthnot, 2003; Madden et al., 2000). Further studies will be needed to determine the function of HBx/DDB1 interaction in virus replication and in HBx activities at the molecular level.
Interestingly, several publications report the interaction of HBx with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1). A role of HDAC1 in HBx functions has been first described for the inhibition of ER alpha-dependent transcriptional activity by HBx and then for the activation of HIF-1α ([Han et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.M511839200); [Yoo et al., 2008](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2008.01.028)). Finally, HBx has been shown to repress the transcription of the insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) through the interaction and the recruitment of HDAC1 on the promoter and the formation of a Sp1/HDAC1 complex, which results in the inhibition of Sp1 ([Shon et al., 2009](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.virol.2009.03.018)). Of note, HBx has been previously shown to negatively regulate XPD and XPC transcription through the inhibition of Sp1 ([Jaitovich-Groisman et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1006/viro.2001.1046)). Interaction with HDAC1 could be a way for HBx to regulate a broad range of viral and cellular functions.

HBx has been shown to interact with and to sequester the nuclear export receptor CRM1, leading to the nuclear localization of NF-κB and to aberrant centriole replication as well as formation of multipolar spindles ([Forgues et al., 2001, 2003](https://doi.org/10.1006/viro.2001.1046)). Deregulation of mitotic spindle assembly by HBx is associated with aneuploidy, which can lead to genomic instability and contribute to cancer development ([Forgues et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1006/viro.2001.1046)).

### C. HBx and Cell Cycle Regulation

Dysregulation of the cell cycle is a common feature of transformed cells. In this regard, many viral oncoproteins, such as adenovirus E1A, HTLV-I Tax, and HPV-16, deregulate cell cycle progression. Actively replicating cells are believed to provide a favorable environment for virus replication ([Neuveut and Jeang, 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00677-3); [Op De Beeck and Caillet-Fauquet, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(02)00677-3)). Many studies have focused on the impact of X gene expression on the cell cycle. It was found that activation of signal transduction pathways (described earlier) such as MAPK, JNK, and Src kinases by HBx stimulate cell cycle progression, accelerating the progression of quiescent G0 cells through the G1- to S-phase, as well as from the G2- to M-phase ([Benn and Schneider, 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(95)00016-8); [Koike et al., 1994b](https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-5793(95)00016-8)). The consequences of HBx expression on the cell cycle depend on the presence of stimulatory factors. Indeed, [Bouchard et al. (2001a)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(95)00016-8) have demonstrated that serum-starved HBx-expressing cells exited G0 but stalled at the G1/S boundary. Similar findings have been reported by [Chirillo et al. (1997)](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(95)00016-8) in serum-starved cells, where HBx induces DNA synthesis followed by apoptosis. The question remains open as to whether HBx induces cell cycle progression or apoptosis. Similarly, some studies have shown that HBx induces the expression of the cell cycle regulators p21 and p27 and the subsequent arrest of the cell at the G1/S boundary ([Park et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(95)00016-8); [Qiao et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0014-5793(95)00016-8)). Others studies have reported
a repression of p21 expression leading to cellular growth (Ahn et al., 2001, 2002). These conflicting data on HBx activity might result from the models used and/or from the expression level of HBx. HBx might differentially regulate cell cycle progression depending on the differentiation state of a hepatocytic cell line (Lee et al., 2002). Studies performed with HBx-transgenic mice reflect the *ex vivo* conflicting results. Madden et al. (2001) reported that expression of HBx is associated with a significant increase in S-phase hepatocytes in liver of young animals but not in adult mice. Another study reported increased apoptosis in the liver of HBx-transgenic mice. However, using the same model it was shown that HBx cooperates with *myc* in oncogenesis, arguing that HBx behaves differentially depending on the cellular context (Terradillos et al., 1997, 1998). Finally, HBx impairs hepatocyte regeneration after partial hepatectomy (Tralhao et al., 2002; Wu et al., 2006). One study describes the same complicated pattern as observed in tissue culture: HBx promoted the transition of quiescent hepatocytes from G0 to G1, but cells stalled at the G1/S boundary and underwent apoptosis (Wu et al., 2006).

It is important to point out that there is a consensus on the fact that HBx induces mitotic aberrations such as multipolar spindle formation, amplification of centrosome, chromosome segregation defects and formation of multinucleated cells (Forgues et al., 2003; Fujii et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008b; Martin-Lluesma et al., 2008; Rakotomalala et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2008; Yun et al., 2004). The molecular mechanisms leading to such abnormalities seem however diverse. Indeed, HBx is thought to exert this function through its interaction with either DDB1 or proteins that interact with the centrosome such as HBXIP and CRM1, or with BubR1, a component of the mitotic checkpoint (Forgues et al., 2003; Fujii et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008b; Martin-Lluesma et al., 2008; Wen et al., 2008). Other studies incriminate the activation of the Ras–MEK–mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway by HBx (Yun et al., 2004). Finally, Rakotomalala et al. (2008) reported recently that HBx increases simultaneously the expression of the replication initiation factors Cdc6 and Cdt1, while inhibiting the expression of geminin, the inhibitor of replication licensing. Modulation of Cdt1/geminin ratio will thus lead to uncontrolled DNA rereplication (Rakotomalala et al., 2008). Downregulation of geminin is in agreement with centrosome duplication and mitotic defects (Lu et al., 2009; Tachibana et al., 2005). However, others failed to observe any DNA rereplication or modulation of Cdt1 or geminin expression in HBx-expressing cells (Martin-Lluesma et al., 2008). Whether these discrepancies may be related to the models used needs further demonstration. The exact molecular mechanisms by which HBx induces mitotic defects still await elucidation.
D. HBx and Apoptosis

As mentioned before, several studies have shown that HBx can modulate both cellular proliferation and viability. Again reflecting its seemingly contrasting and complex functions, HBx has been shown to either mediate apoptosis, sensitize cells to proapoptotic stimuli, or to prevent apoptosis. In chronic HBV infection, liver cell injury is believed to be mediated mostly by the cellular immune response. However, several studies suggest that HBx might contribute to liver disease by modulating pathways controlling apoptosis. HBx exerts a spontaneous proapoptotic effect in cultured primary hepatocytes and in the liver of HBx-transgenic mice (Koike *et al.*, 1998; Pollicino *et al.*, 1998; Terradillos *et al.*, 1998, 2002). Induction of cell death by HBx has been described to be both p53-mediated as well as p53-independent and could be mediated through interaction with c-FLIP or by causing loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (Chami *et al.*, 2003; Clippinger and Bouchard, 2008; Koike *et al.*, 1998; McClain *et al.*, 2007; Pollicino *et al.*, 1998; Terradillos *et al.*, 1998, 2002). The role of mitochondria in HBx-induced apoptosis is supported by the fact that direct interaction has been reported between HBx and the mitochondria as mentioned earlier (Kim *et al.*, 2007b; Rahmani *et al.*, 2000; Shirakata and Koike, 2003). HBx-induced apoptosis can be blocked by permeability transition pore (PTP) inhibitors, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, caspase inhibitors or by overexpression of BCL-2 or BCl-xl (Chami *et al.*, 2003; Shirakata and Koike, 2003). Moreover, the decrease of intracellular calcium level using calcium chelators or calcium-free media significantly decreases apoptosis induced by HBx (Chami *et al.*, 2003). Whether HBx interaction with mitochondria results in cytochrome $c$ release and caspase activation remains under debate (Chami *et al.*, 2003; Shirakata and Koike, 2003; Takada *et al.*, 1999). This interaction has also been shown to be responsible for the production of ROS and lipid peroxide (Lee *et al.*, 2004; Waris *et al.*, 2001). Interestingly, such dysfunction seems to sensitize cells to apoptotic signals rather than inducing apoptosis *per se* (Lee *et al.*, 2004). This finding is supported by the work of Waris *et al.* (2001), showing that ROS production in HBx-expressing cells leads to STAT-3 and NF-$\kappa$B activation. It is important to note that replication of HBV at high levels in transgenic mouse liver has not been associated with pathological death of hepatocytes (Guidotti *et al.*, 1995). Furthermore, HBx expressed from a replicating HBV genome might not directly induce apoptosis but act as a “sensitizer” to other proapoptotic stimuli. More specifically, HBx might provide hypersensitivity to killing by tumor necrosis factor (TNF-$\alpha$) through a particular set of conditions, involving activation of JNK and Myc pathways (Su and Schneider, 1997; Su *et al.*, 2001). This finding has been confirmed by
different groups (Kim and Seong, 2003; Lee et al., 2004). In striking contrast, HBx has been found to inhibit apoptosis induced by p53, transforming growth factor $\beta$ (TGF-$\beta$), or Fas (Elmore et al., 1997a; Pan et al., 2001; Shih et al., 2000). The antiapoptotic activity of HBx could be mediated through its interaction with the survivin–HBXIP complex or through the activation of the PI-3-K or NF-$\kappa$B signaling pathway (Marusawa et al., 2003; Shih et al., 2000; Su et al., 2001). From the study of Su et al. (2001), it seems that HBx’s effect on cell viability might be highly dependent on the cellular context. This idea is supported by the work of Clippinger et al. (2009), showing that expression of HBx alone or in the context of HBV replication in primary rat hepatocytes induces or protects from apoptosis depending of the NF-$\kappa$B status. In this study, the authors link apoptosis to the modulation of the MPTP. To date, there is no direct evidence that HBV is able to modulate the apoptotic pathways, especially under *in vivo* conditions, nor that apoptosis could provide any advantage to virus replication. A reasonable scenario is that HBx would inhibit apoptosis during early hepatocyte infection, favoring viral replication, and that it would activate apoptosis at later stages to facilitate viral spread and immune evasion. A consequence of HBx-induced apoptosis could be the enhancement of the regeneration process providing a larger reservoir of hepatocytes for virus spreading. Alternatively, apoptosis could be a consequence of other activities of HBx that are deleterious for the cell, such as the deregulation of cell cycle.

# E. HBx and DNA Repair

Active mechanisms protect the genome of human cells from endogenous or exogenous substances that damage cellular DNA. The DNA repair enzymes constantly scan the global genome to detect and remove DNA damage. Five DNA repair pathways have been identified such as homologous recombinational repair (HRR), nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ), mismatch repair (MMR), nucleotide excision repair (NER), and base excision repair (BER) (Bernstein et al., 2002). NER affects the repair of different type of lesions. In particular, it eliminates highly promutagenic DNA lesions induced by UV irradiation or by DNA-adducting carcinogens such as aflatoxin B1 (a liver-specific carcinogen), lesions that are known to block transcription. Dysregulation of this function leads to accumulation of mutations that predispose cells to transformation. Several groups have investigated whether HBx could interfere with this process. It has been described that HBx inhibits the repair of DNA damage in cell culture (Becker et al., 1998; Groisman et al., 1999; Jia et al., 1999; Prost et al., 1998). The mechanism by which HBx inhibits NER is unknown, but is thought to occur through the interaction of HBx with proteins or protein complexes
involved in DNA repair such as TFIIH and p53 (Feitelson *et al.*, 1993; Jia *et al.*, 1999; Prost *et al.*, 1998; Wang *et al.*, 1994, 1995). HBx could also modulate NER activity through downregulation of the XPB and XPD components of TFIIH (Jaitovich-Groisman *et al.*, 2001). A recent report shows that HBx interferes with DNA interstrand crosslink (ICL) repair, leading to an increase in DNA breaks. The authors suggested that HBx interferes with the intra-S-phase checkpoint (Wu *et al.*, 2008). Madden and colleagues have developed a transgenic mouse model to measure the action of HBx on DNA repair *in vivo*. They showed that HBx did not significantly increase the accumulation of spontaneous mutations, suggesting that inhibition of NER by HBx may lead to an increase in mutation frequency only after exposure to exogenous mutagenic agents (Madden *et al.*, 2000). A report from the same group failed to detect any obvious increase in mutations in the liver of HBx-transgenic mice treated with the hepatocarcinogen diethylnitrosamine, and they proposed that HBx might act as a tumor promoter by increasing the proliferation rate, allowing the proliferation of hepatocytes containing unrepaired DNA damage (Madden *et al.*, 2001). Using the same model, they assessed the impact of HBx expression on the frequency of aflatoxin B1-induced DNA mutation. They observed a modest increase in mutation frequency in HBx mice, associated however with an increase in the incidence of transversion mutations (Madden *et al.*, 2002). The interference of HBx with the cellular DNA repair system provides yet another potential mechanism by which HBx contributes to liver carcinogenesis.

VI. CONCLUSION

Despite extensive and significant studies, the precise role of HBx in HBV replication and in the development of liver cancer remains an open question. The difficulty to assess its role comes first from the lack of a convenient and clinically relevant model to study virus replication. Moreover, the use of different models and immortalized or transformed cell lines to study HBx activities contributes unquestionably to the emergence of seemingly contradictory results. However, in light of all the activities described above on virus replication and on the modulation of the cellular environment by acting on transcription, cycle regulation, apoptosis, and DNA repair, HBx plays without doubt an important role in the replication of HBV, but also in cancer development. This idea is further supported by the fact that the duck HBV that lacks an X open reading frame does not induce cancer in ducks. Thus, HBx represents an attractive therapeutic target. Indeed, interfering with HBx expression or activity could allow controlling not only virus load but
also tumor growth, since HBx could be expressed both by the integrated virus and by the episomal DNA found in some tumors. Control of HBx expression could be done through the use of anti-HBx antibodies. Attempts have already been made and resulted in significant tumor regression ([Kumar and Sarkar, 2004]). On the other hand, HBx may be targeted by the mean of ribozymes or small interfering RNAs. Such approaches led to the inhibition of HBV replication as well as to a potent suppression of tumor growth ([Cheng et al., 2007; Kumar and Sarkar, 2004; Nash et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2008]). Finally, an alternative approach will be to target HBx activities. Its interaction with its cellular partner DDB1 appears a promising therapeutic target since the integrity of the interaction between HBx and DDB1 has been shown to be required in tissue culture for HBx activities, but also *in vivo* for virus replication in the woodchuck model ([Leupin et al., 2005; Sitterlin et al., 2000a]).
