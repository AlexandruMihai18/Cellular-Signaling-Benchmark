Abstract

Progesterone is a sexual steroid hormone that has a critical role in reproductive processes in males and females of several species, including humans. Furthermore, progesterone has been associated with pathological diseases such as breast, gynecological and brain cancer, regulating cell proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis. In the past, progesterone actions were thought to be only mediated by its intracellular receptor (PR). However, recent evidence has demonstrated that membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) mediate most of the non-classical progesterone actions. The role of the different mPRs subtypes in progesterone effects in reproduction and cancer is an emerging and exciting research area. Here we review studies to date regarding mPRs role in reproduction and cancer and discuss their functions and clinical relevance, suggesting mPRs as putative pharmacological targets and disease markers in cancer and diseases associated with reproduction.

Keywords

Progesterone, membrane progesterone receptors, reproduction, cancer, reproductive diseases.

1. Introduction

Progesterone is a steroid hormone that is mainly synthesized and secreted by ovaries, placenta, adrenal glands, and testis. It can also be de novo synthesized from cholesterol or from circulating pregnenolone in the brain, spinal cord and peripheral nerves (Genazzani et al., 2000).

Progesterone participates in the regulation of different reproductive processes in females such as ovulation, embryo implantation, pregnancy, mammary gland development, sexual differentiation and sexual behavior in several vertebrate species (Brinton et al., 2008; Guerra-Araiza et al., 2009; Macias and Hinck, 2012; Mesiano et al., 2011). It has also been demonstrated that progesterone is involved in the development and function of sperm (Baldi et al., 2009). Furthermore, progesterone has multiple non-reproductive functions such as neuroprotection and neurogenesis, immune system regulation and stimulation of respiration (Díaz et al., 2009; González-Arenas and Agramonte-Hevia, 2012; Nava-Castro et al., 2012). Importantly, progesterone plays a central role as critical regulator in breast, gynecological and brain cancer (Camacho-Arroyo et al., 2000; Diep et al., 2015; Obr and Edwards, 2012; Piña-Medina et al., 2016).

The mechanisms of action of progesterone can be classified as classical (genomic) and non-classical (non-genomic), with the possibility that both occur in the same cell at the same time (Fairet al., 2005; Lösel et al., 2005). The first mechanism comprises the long-term effects that are modulated by the intracellular progesterone receptor (PR), a ligand-dependent transcription factor that dimerizes and binds to specific progesterone response elements (PREs) within the promoter of progesterone target genes to regulate transcription (Hernández-Hernández and Camacho-Arroyo, 2013; Scarpin et al., 2009). The second mechanism occurs in membrane and cytoplasm by generating short-term or rapid effects (in the lapse of seconds or minutes) such as ion channel activation, regulation of second messengers concentration and activation of kinases (Lösel and Wehling, 2003). The non-classical progesterone effects can be mediated by hormone interaction with PR (Leonhardt et al., 2003), ionic channels (Lishko et al., 2011),
neurotransmitter receptors (Henderson, 2007), growth factor receptors (Cheskis, 2004) and with specific receptors localized in the plasma membrane (Tubbs and Thomas, 2008).

The participation of specific membrane receptors involved in the non-classical progesterone actions has been demonstrated by the use of progesterone coupled to bovine serum albumin (BSA) that cannot pass into the cell (Peluso et al., 2002) and by binding studies (Dosiou et al., 2008). Furthermore, the fact that progesterone actions have been observed in cells not expressing PR has confirmed the involvement of other possible receptors in progesterone actions (Dosiou et al., 2008). For a long time, the identity of these receptors was uncertain, however, experimental evidence from recent years has demonstrated that two types of membrane proteins unrelated to PR can mediate progesterone effects: the membrane progesterone receptors (mPRs) and the progesterone receptor membrane components (PGRMCs).

In 2003, Thomas and collaborators first described a new class of progesterone receptor on the membrane of fish oocytes, named mPRα (Zhu et al., 2003b). Subsequently, two similar receptors were also identified in different vertebrates including humans and were called mPRβ and mPRγ (Zhu et al., 2003a); recently, the identity of two other mPR subtypes called mPRδ and mPRε were also confirmed in humans (Pang et al., 2013).

Since mPRs discovery, the interest in elucidating their functions has increased, as they are differentially expressed in reproductive and neural tissues, as well as in immune cells (Dressing et al., 2011). Furthermore, the recent finding that mPRs are also expressed in different cancer cells lines and tissues has opened a new interesting field of study. In fact, mPRs have been related to key processes in cancer disease such as proliferation, apoptosis, and metastasis (Dressing et al., 2012; Vares et al., 2015; Zuo et al., 2010).

PGRMC family of progesterone receptors located in the cell membrane also participates in many physiological and pathological processes, such as estrous
cycle, pregnancy, cell cycle progression in granulosa cells, breast, and ovarian cancer (Kowalik et al., 2013; Mueck et al., 2014; Peluso, 2011; Peluso et al., 2014). This review will focus on mPRs characteristics and their role in mediating progesterone actions in reproduction and cancer. In addition, clinical implications and future perspectives in mPRs research are discussed.

## 2. mPRs

mPRs belong to the progesterone and adipoQ receptor (PAQR) family, which is divided into three subgroups according to the structure and ligand specificity: related to adiponectin receptor (Class I), related to mPR (Class II) and related to hemolysin III (Class III) (Baida and Kuzmin, 1996; Lyons et al., 2004; Tang et al., 2005). According to this classification, PAQRs class II comprises five members present in vertebrates: PAQR7 (mPRα), PAQR8 (mPRβ), PAQR5 (mPRγ), PAQR6 (mPRδ) and PAQR9 (mPRε) (Smith et al., 2008).

In humans, mPRs are encoded by different genes located on distinct chromosomes (Tang et al., 2005) (Table 1). The length of mPR proteins varies between 330 and 377 amino acids (Table 1) and all of them contain a large proportion of α-helices in a central region encoded within the UPF0073 domain (Pfam database EMBL-EBI) (Finn et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2005). These receptors have hydrophobic properties and according to an *in silico* analysis, they contain three conserved regions that share the PAQR family: 1) the PxₙGYRxₙEx₂Nx₃H motif that precedes the transmembrane domain 1 (TMD1); 2) the Sx₃HxₙD motif that spans the end of TMD2 and the beginning of TMD3; 3) the PEx₃PGxₙHQx₂H motif that spans the loop preceding TMD7 (Smith et al., 2008).

Nowadays, there is still some controversy regarding the structural and topological features of mPRs since their tridimensional structure has not been elucidated by experimental approaches due to their rapid degradation. By using bioinformatics, Thomas and colleagues reported that mPRs are formed by seven TMD and contain an extracellular amino-terminal domain and an intracellular carboxyl-terminal domain (Tang et al., 2005; Zhu et al., 2003a).

This model supported the idea that mPRs are similar to G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which to date is the most widely accepted model. We have built a tridimensional model of mPRA, mPRB and mPRy by using the Phyre2 web portal (Figs. 1A, 1B and 1C, respectively) that constructs tridimensional models based on advanced remote homology detection methods (Kelley et al., 2015). Interestingly, when comparing the obtained tridimensional models for the three mPRs and searching for similarity among structures with the FATCAT web server (Ye and Godzik, 2004) and PyMOL software (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 1.7.4.5 Schrödinger, LLC) it was observed that the three predicted structures are highly similar (Fig. 1D). This suggests that the tridimensional conformation of the modeled mPRs subtypes is conserved, however, further studies are required to elucidate their structure and confirm this finding.

mPRs were discovered in teleost ovaries (Zhu et al., 2003b) and subsequently identified in sheep, pig, mouse, rat and human (Aparicio et al., 2011; Dressing et al., 2011; Qiu et al., 2008; Thomas et al., 2007; You et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2003a). Binding assays have revealed that mPRs display a high affinity to progesterone (Kd=5nM) and low affinity to PR agonists and antagonists, R5020 (Kd=10µM) and RU486 (Kd=8µM). mPRs also display a lower affinity to some progesterone metabolites such as allopregnanolone, however, general binding characteristics

slightly vary depending on mPR subtype, cell and species (Kelder et al., 2010; Smith et al., 2008; Zhu et al., 2003a).

mPRs expression is widely distributed in several organs such as the brain, the reproductive, immune and respiratory systems. mPRα is predominantly expressed

in reproductive tissues, mPRβ in neuronal tissues, mPRy in kidney, colon and lung (Zhu et al., 2003a) and mPRδ and mPRε are expressed in different brain regions (Pang et al., 2013).

Progestins activate a variety of signaling pathways through mPRs (Figs. 2 and 3). These actions depend on the model of study, the progestin evaluated and the mPR subtype. The signaling pathways regulated by mPRs in reproduction and cancer are discussed in sections 3 and 4.

## 3. mPRs in reproductive function

Progesterone is essential for the normal development and function of female reproductive tissues since it coordinates many physiological processes such as mammary gland development, maintenance of pregnancy, ovulation, and the display of sexual behavior (González-Flores et al., 2004; Macias and Hinck, 2012; Mesiano et al., 2011). Although there is supporting evidence that demonstrates the participation of PR in these processes, recent studies have suggested the participation of mPRs in the regulation of these events. Besides, there is increasing evidence that highlights the importance of progesterone in male reproductive processes, particularly, spermatogenesis and fertilization. In fact, it has been demonstrated that progesterone promotes the acrosome reaction, as well as sperm hyperactivation, motility, capacitation, and chemotaxis, which are suggested to be regulated by mPRs (Baldi et al., 2009).

### 3.1 mPRs in female reproductive tissues

mPRs expression has been studied in female reproductive and embryonic tissues, such as endometrium, myometrium, ovaries, placenta, among others (Fernandes et al., 2005; Karteris et al., 2006; Merlino et al., 2007). It has been reported that mPRα, mPRγ and mPRε gene expression varies during the menstrual cycle in human endometrium, where mPRα shows the highest expression during the secretory phase whereas mPRγ and mPRε exhibit the highest expression during the proliferative phase (Fernandes et al., 2005).
The expression of mPRα and mPRβ is modified during pregnancy in human myometrium; mPRα expression is decreased during preterm and term labor, while mPRβ expression is only decreased during term labor (Fernandes et al., 2005; Karteris et al., 2006). The decrease in mPRα and mPRβ expression during term labor could contribute to the progesterone withdrawal observed at the onset of labor, in which there is also a change in the proportion of the intracellular receptors (PR-B/PR-A) in favor to PR-A isoform (Karteris et al., 2006; Merlino et al., 2007).

It has been proposed that both mPRα and mPRβ are coupled to inhibitory G proteins and have a dual role in human myometrium before and during the onset of labor (Karteris et al., 2006). First, it has been suggested that both receptors potentiate the transactivation activity of PR-B during gestation, which is essential to maintain myometrial quiescence and cervical closure (Karteris et al., 2006; Merlino et al., 2007). Second, mPRα and mPRβ activate the p38 MAPK pathway to induce the phosphorylation of Myosin Light Chain and downregulate SRC2 expression (PR-B coactivator) at the end of pregnancy, triggering labor and delivery (Karteris et al., 2006; Mesiano et al., 2011) (Fig. 2).

It has been reported that mPRα is highly expressed in the placental and fetal membranes as compared with mPRβ and mPRγ. In gestational tissues, the expression profile of mPRε and mPRα is similar but opposite to that of intracellular PR, highlighting the importance of these mPRs in progesterone responsive tissues that express low levels of classical PR (Fernandes et al., 2005).

mPRα presents a higher expression than mPRβ and mPRγ in ovaries and corpus luteum of rats (Cai and Stocco, 2005) and its expression is induced after ovulation and by human chorionic gonadotropin in the endometrium of pregnant sheep (Coleson et al., 2015). In human myometrial cells mPRα expression is induced by progesterone whereas that of mPRβ is induced by estradiol (Fernandes et al., 2005; Karteris et al., 2006). It has been reported that both mPRβ and mPRγ are expressed in the ciliated cells of fallopian tubes and are sensitive to estradiol and progesterone, which could be associated with the cilia movement induced by progesterone to promote gamete transport (Natu et al., 2009).Another widely used model to study the functional role of mPRs in female reproduction is the fish. mPRα was first detected in the membrane fraction of the seatrout oocyte, where it is transiently induced by the progestin 17,20β,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20β-S). mPRα is also induced by gonadotropins during seatrout oocyte maturation followed by a dramatic decrease in ovulated oocytes (Zhu et al., 2003b). By contrast, mPRβ gene is highly expressed during zebrafish oocyte maturation and the corresponding protein levels were also increased during this process (Hanna and Zhu, 2009). This induction pattern of mPRα and mPRβ expression promoted by gonadotropins and during oocyte maturation has been observed in other fish species and importantly, it has been demonstrated that progestin induction of oocyte maturation depends on both membrane receptors in zebrafish, goldfish, and croaker (Thomas et al., 2004; Tokumoto et al., 2006; Tubbs et al., 2010; Zhu et al., 2003b). However, it has been reported that only mPRα overexpression induces a progestin-dependent rapid maturation of zebrafish oocyte, which has been associated with an increase on MAPK signaling activation and cyclin B expression (Hanna and Zhu, 2011) (Fig. 2).

It has been proposed that during fish oocyte maturation mPRα activates a pertussis toxin-sensitive inhibitory G protein (Gi), which in turn inhibits the activity of adenylyl cyclase (AC) to decrease cAMP levels (Thomas, 2012). In contrast to fish models, it has been reported that mPRβ regulates oocytes maturation in pig and Xenopus (Josefsberg Ben-Yehoshua et al., 2007; Qiu et al., 2008), suggesting that oocyte maturation mediated by specific mPRs subtypes is species dependent (Fig. 2).

Interestingly, we have described for the first time that mPRy is differentially expressed in the left growing and right regressing ovary of chickens during development, which correlates with the functional state of the left ovary and its response to progesterone at 1-week and 1-month of age (González-Morán et al., 2013). In contrast, mPRα and mPRβ are highly expressed in the left ovary as compared to mPRy earlier during development, which suggests an important role
of mPRs in mediating progesterone actions in the chicken ovary during development (Mi et al., 2014).

Fig. 2. Signal transduction pathways mediated by mPRs in reproductive tissues. Schematic representations of mPRs activated signaling pathways in female reproductive processes in fish (A), human (B) and sperm function (C) are depicted. A) In fish, PKA activation by cAMP usually results in the inactivation of MAPK signaling and the inhibition of oocyte maturation by downregulating cyclin B levels (black lines). However, ligand bound mPRA activates inhibitory G proteins to decrease cAMP (red lines) and inactivates PKA, which in turn induces the activation of MAPK signaling and the increase of cyclin B resulting in cell cycle progression and final oocyte maturation (Hanna and Zhu, 2011). Besides, the activation of inhibitory G protein via mPRA induces the activation of ERK and Akt signaling pathways that inhibit cell apoptosis in granulosa and theca cells (Dressing et al., 2010). B) In humans, the activation of mPRA and mPRB by progesterone induces the transactivation of intracellular PR-B during early pregnancy to promote myometrial quiescence and cervical closure. In contrast, during the onset of labor the increased expression of mPRA is associated with the

activation of MLC (via p38 signaling) and downregulation (red lines) of SRC2 (PR-B coactivator) triggering labor and delivery ((Karteris et al., 2006). C) Ligand-bound mPRα induces sperm hypermotility by several signaling pathways: mPRα activates an olfactory G protein that in turn activates AC, increasing cAMP levels, which leads to an increase in intracellular free calcium concentration; mPRα via olfactory G protein is also able to activate the PI3k/Akt pathway regulating PDE activity which in turn increases cAMP levels and intracellular free calcium concentration. The activation of the βy complex by mPRα induces the subsequent activation of EGFR, ERBB2 and MAPK signaling pathways via Src (Tan and Thomas, 2015). AC, Adenyl cyclase; MLC, Myosin Light Chain; MMP, Matrix Metalloproteases; PDE, phosphodiesterase; PR-B, intracellular progesterone receptor B; Src, tyrosine-protein kinase; SRC2, steroid receptor coactivator-2.

It has also been demonstrated that mPRα mediates the antiapoptotic effects of progestins in serum-starved croaker ovarian follicle cells by the activation of a Gi and the ERK and Akt kinases (Dressing et al., 2010). These studies provide important clinical implications to the further understanding of progesterone signaling by mPRs during oocyte maturation and pregnancy. The study of mPRs functions during human pregnancy could lead to the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for woman infertility, such as in the case of endometriosis, a disease characterized by progesterone resistance (Ashrafi et al., 2016; Attia et al., 2000).

Besides, progesterone treatment is one of the most used therapies to avoid preterm birth (Romero et al., 2014). The incidence of preterm birth is 5 to 18% worldwide and represents a leading cause of infant morbidity and mortality that it is associated with neurological, cardiovascular, respiratory, gastrointestinal, among other disorders (Minguet-Romero et al., 2014; Romero et al., 2014). The better understanding of mPRs function in human pregnancy will contribute to the improvement of therapies and diagnoses regarding preterm birth and other pregnancy disorders.

Another progesterone responsive organ that is essential to reproduction is the brain. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated that sexual behavior is influenced by progesterone rapid actions in the midbrain ventral tegmental area (VTA) of rodents
and that mPRα and mPRβ are differentially regulated during estrous cycle and by estradiol and progesterone in different brain areas related to sexual behavior such as the anteroventral periventricular nucleus (AVPV), preoptic area (POA) and ventromedial nucleus (VMN) of female rats (Frye, 2001; Intlekofer and Petersen, 2011; Liu and Arbogast, 2009). In particular, the expression of mPRα and mPRβ increases during the proestrus phase in the mediobasal hypothalamus of rats, a critical region for the display of sexual behavior (Liu and Arbogast, 2009).

In contrast to the endometrium and myometrium, mPRβ expression is higher than that of mPRα in different brain areas of estradiol-primed rats, such as the hippocampus, midbrain and thalamus (Zuloaga et al., 2012). Furthermore, mPRβ gene expression is induced by estradiol and estradiol plus progesterone treatments in the AVPV of female rats and it is induced by estradiol alone in POA, while progesterone alone treatment downregulates mPRβ gene expression in the AVPV (Intlekofer and Petersen, 2011). In contrast, mPRα gene expression is not modified by estradiol and/or progesterone treatments in the AVPV and POA of female rats (Intlekofer and Petersen, 2011), suggesting that mPRβ participates in the hormonal regulation of sexual behavior. Thus, both mPRβ and the intracellular PR could mediate the hormone-dependent regulation of sexual behavior in the AVPV and POA of the female rat.

It has been demonstrated that mPRα and mPRβ expression in the VTA is necessary for the display of progestin facilitated lordosis in rodents (Frye et al., 2013, 2014). However, it has been suggested that only mPRβ is the target of progestins to mediate the rapid facilitation of lordosis in rats (Frye et al., 2014). Despite their physiological roles described in rodent sexual behavior, the reproductive functions of mPRs in the human brain have not been described. However, it has been suggested that mPRs participate in the negative feedback of progesterone on GnRH neurosecretion, which disturbances have been implicated in infertility diseases, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome (Sleiter et al., 2009). Therefore, the further understanding of mPRs in human female reproductive axis would provide tools for the diagnosis and/or therapy of these diseases.
3.2 mPRs in sperm functions

Although there are controversies on the mechanisms involved in the progesterone actions on sperm function, the participation of rapid or non-genomic processes has been fully demonstrated (Baldi et al., 2009). The fact that non-permeable progesterone induces sperm Ca²⁺ influx, Cl⁻ efflux, tyrosine phosphorylation and cAMP increase in order to trigger the acrosome reaction, supports the participation of a membrane receptor (Foresta et al., 1993; Lishko et al., 2011; Sabeur et al., 1996). Moreover, the use of a specific antibody against the ligand binding domain of PR (which is supposed to be structurally conserved among intracellular and membrane receptors) was shown to block the Ca²⁺ influx and the acrosome reaction induced by progesterone (but not by antibodies against other domains of PR), supporting the participation of a non-intracellular PR (Luconi et al., 2004). In addition, the acrosome reaction is also influenced by the maturation stage of sperms, which correlates with the functional response to progesterone that could be mediated by mPRs (Sirivaidyapong et al., 2001).

It has been reported the presence of three types of receptors in mammalian sperms (intracellular PRs, mPRs, and PGRMCs); however, there is still controversies about their functional role (De Amicis et al., 2012; Lösel et al., 2005; Thomas et al., 2009). It has been demonstrated that functional mPRα is expressed in human sperm and, it is localized at the plasma membrane of sperm midpiece (Thomas et al., 2009). Decreased expression of mPRα has been correlated with low sperm motility as compared with normal motile sperm from human donors. This finding suggests that mPRα is involved in human sperm motility induced by progesterone, as demonstrated in fish models such as croaker and sea trout (Tan and Thomas, 2014; Tan et al., 2014; Thomas et al., 2004, 2005, 2009; Tubbs and Thomas, 2008; Zhu et al., 2003b).

The increase in the percentage of motile sperm and velocity of croaker sperm induced by the progestin 20β-S has been associated with a rapid increase in intracellular cAMP and Ca²⁺ levels on sperms, which strongly suggest the

participation of an mPR (Thomas, 2004; Thomas et al., 2004). Furthermore, high expression of mPRα in seatrout and southern flounder sperm has been associated with higher sperm motility and fertility, which in turn was confirmed by using the specific mPR agonist, 10-ethenyl-19-norprogesterone (Org OD 02-0) (Tan et al., 2014; Tubbs and Thomas, 2008; Tubbs et al., 2010). It has been reported that a super active gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRh) analog (d-Ala6-des-Gly10) increases flounder sperm motility and fertilization success, which in turn was associated with an increase in mPRα expression in the plasma membrane of sperms, suggesting the participation of the pituitary-testis reproductive axis in the regulation of expression and function of mPRα (Tan et al., 2014; Tubbs and Thomas, 2009).

The expression of mPRα has also been reported in croaker and zebrafish testis (Hanna and Zhu, 2009; Thomas et al., 2005). Gonadotropin treatments induce mPRα expression in croaker testes and increase the binding of 20β-S to croaker and seatrout testicular membranes (Tubbs et al., 2010). By contrast, mPRβ is strongly expressed in spermatogonia and spermatocytes in zebrafish, which suggests its participation in the maturation process of sperms (Hanna and Zhu, 2009).

The mechanism of progestins action through mPRα in sperms has started to be elucidated in croaker and southern flounder fish models (Tan and Thomas, 2015, 2014; Tan et al., 2014; Tubbs and Thomas, 2009). It has been reported that 20β-S activates a stimulatory G protein, the olfactory-type G protein (Golf), that activates a membrane AC that increases cAMP levels, which may lead to the increase in Ca²⁺ levels that induces sperm hypermotility (Tan et al., 2014; Tubbs and Thomas, 2009) (Fig. 2). In fact, mPRα and Golf were found to be coexpressed in the midpiece of croaker sperm and coimmunoprecipitated from sperm membranes (Tubbs and Thomas, 2009) (Fig. 2).

In addition, it has also been demonstrated that croaker sperm hypermotility is induced through the PI3K/AKT pathway by using the Org OD 02-0 mPR agonist (Harper et al., 2004). The activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been associated
with an increase in phosphodiesterase activity, which has been proposed as a regulation mechanism of cAMP levels and the oscillation of Ca²⁺ levels observed in the hyperactivated mammalian sperm (Fig. 2), however, further studies are required to confirm the participation of mPRα in these events (Harper et al., 2004; Tan and Thomas, 2014). The activation of the Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR and ERBB2) and MAPK signaling pathways through mPRα has also been recently proposed as a mechanism by which progestins induce croaker sperm hypermotility (Tan and Thomas, 2015) (Fig. 2).

The correlation between mPRs expression and the functional activity of human sperms, as well as the progesterone action through these receptors to mediate fertilization, would provide important diagnostic tools to assess sperm fertilizing potential. In fact, it has been reported that the analysis of sperm responsiveness to progesterone predicts the fertilization outcome, which in turn is important to detect male infertility, to assess sperm quality for in vitro fertilization and to choose the most appropriate strategy in assisted reproduction (Baldi et al., 1999). The increase in the understanding of mPRs in sperm biology would provide additional tools to improve the diagnosis and probably therapeutic approaches for male infertility (Tapia Serrano, 2012). Moreover, the elucidation of the mechanisms involved in mPRs signaling on human sperm Ca²⁺ influx would lead to the development of non-hormonal contraceptives for males (Lishko et al., 2011).

### 4. mPRs in breast, gynecological and brain cancer

Progesterone plays a critical role in the development of breast, ovarian and brain cancer (Cabrera-Muñoz et al., 2011; Hennessy et al., 2009; Lange and Yee, 2008). The participation of progesterone in breast and ovarian cancer biology has been widely studied because of their high frequency in women around the world (Siegel et al., 2015). Besides, recent studies have demonstrated the role of progesterone in the growth, invasion and migration of astrocytomas, the most common and aggressive tumors in the human brain (Germán-Castelán et al., 2014; González-Aguero et al., 2007; Piña-Medina et al., 2016). Progesterone actions in breast, ovarian and brain cancer have been usually attributed to be mediated by PR

16
activation and the PR-A/PR-B expression rate has been related to the incidence, prognosis, and anti-cancer drug therapy success (Cabrera-Muñoz et al., 2011; Diep et al., 2015). However, the fact that progesterone regulates specific functions in cancer cells that do not express the intracellular PR or that are only partially explained by PR activation has implicated mPRs in cancer development and progression (Xie et al., 2012; Zuo et al., 2010). Several studies have demonstrated that mPRs are expressed in different tissues and cell lines derived from breast, ovarian and brain cancer (Charles et al., 2010; Dressing and Thomas, 2007; Romero-Sánchez et al., 2008; Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2015).

Dressing and collaborators first reported that mPRA, mPRB, and mPRy are expressed in MCF-7 and SKBR3 human breast cancer cell lines, and that mPRA was the predominant subtype in both cell lines (Dressing and Thomas, 2007). They proposed that mPRA, mPRB and mPRy overexpression is associated with breast cancer development and progression (Dressing et al., 2012; Dressing and Thomas, 2007). A correlation between mPRA, mPRy and intracellular PR expression has been found in breast cancer tissues, suggesting a cross-talk between these two kinds of progesterone receptors in breast cancer. However, mPRs are also expressed in breast cancer cell lines and biopsies that do not express the PR (Dressing and Thomas, 2007; Dressing et al., 2012; Pang and Thomas, 2011; Xie et al., 2012; Zuo et al., 2010). Interestingly, progesterone increases mPRA protein content in the MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cell line that does not express the PR (Zuo et al., 2010).

The study of mPRs function in the biology of basal phenotype breast cancer (BPBC) is of great interest since BPBC derived cells do not express PR or express low levels (Zuo et al., 2010). Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) is often associated with BPBC, and in MD-MB-468 BPBC cells, it was demonstrated that progesterone decreases snail and fibronectin protein content (EMT markers) and increases that of E-cadherin and occludin (cell-cell junction proteins) in a dose-dependent manner via mPRA (Zuo et al., 2010). Morphological changes associated with EMT and cell proliferation were also inhibited by progesterone via mPRA by
activating EGFR and PI3k/Akt signaling pathways (Zuo et al., 2010) (Fig. 3). Since EMT is a critical process that leads to cancer invasion and metastasis (Talbot et al., 2012), the study of the molecular mechanisms involved in the EMT process is of great interest to predict tumor progression and to develop new therapies. Thus, mPRα could be a new promising therapeutic target.

It has been demonstrated that progesterone decreases serum starvation-induced cell death in SKBR3 and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer cells (PR negative) via mPRα (Dressing et al., 2012). In this study, it was proposed that mPR inhibition of apoptosis was mediated by mitochondrial membrane hyperpolarization via PI3K/Akt and/or MAPK p42/44 signaling pathways (Dressing et al., 2012) (Fig. 3). The above studies suggest that mPRα activation has diverse roles in different breast cancer cell lines.

One of the main interests in studying the mPRs role in breast cancer biology is due to its possible relation to breast cancer prognosis. In this sense, Xie and collaborators have reported that mPRα expression is negatively associated with breast cancer tumor node metastasis (TNM) stage, since a higher mPRα expression was observed in patients with earlier TNM stages (0–3) while lower mPRα expression was found in patients with the TNM stage 4 (Xie et al., 2012). Furthermore, a negative correlation between mPRα and ER expression and a positive correlation between mPRα and HER2 expression has been reported, suggesting that mPRα is a good candidate as a novel biomarker for breast cancer (Xie et al., 2012). In contrast, a recent study reported that mPRα, Akt, and MMP-9 expression is associated with a bad prognosis in breast cancer (Wu et al., 2015).

Interestingly, it has been recently reported that the combination of progesterone and irradiation treatments increases the generation of breast cancer stem cells in the non-cancerous MCF10A basal-like PR-negative cell line. The increase in breast cancer stem cells content was mediated by the PI3K/Akt signaling pathway via mPRs, which was associated with the downregulation of miR-29 and subsequent upregulation of KLF4 (a transcription factor required for cancer stem cells maintenance) (Vares et al., 2015).
To date, few reports have been focused on studying the role of mPRs in ovarian cancer development, however, the fact that progesterone displays a dual effect on apoptosis induction in ovarian cancer cells via classical and non-classical mechanisms highlights the importance of establishing the role of mPRs in gynecological cancer (Diep et al., 2015; Peluso, 2011). mPRs have been detected in cervical and ovarian cancer (Charles et al., 2010; Romero-Sánchez et al., 2008).

A schematic representation of mPRs activated signaling pathways in apoptosis regulation in breast (A) and ovarian (B) cancer cells, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (C) and cancer stem cells (CSC) maintenance in breast cancer (D) are depicted.

A) Activation of PI3k/Akt and p42/44 MAPK pathways via mPRα inhibits apoptosis in breast cancer cells (Dressing et al., 2012).

B) In ovarian cancer cells, it has been proposed that ligand bound mPRα potentiates ADRβ1/2-mediated cAMP production and cAMP-mediated transcription to upregulate pro-apoptotic genes. Furthermore, apoptosis induction via a mPR is proposed to be initiated by the activation of the βγ complex that in turn activates JNK 1/2 (and subsequent BAX expression) and p38 MAPK pathways (Charles et al., 2010).

C) In basal phenotype

breast cancer cells (BPBC), PI3K/Akt pathway is necessary for the induction of EMT (black lines). However, ligand bound mPRα is able to directly activate Cav-1 or via EGFR to inactivate the PI3K/Akt pathway resulting in the EMT reversion (red lines) (Zuo et al., 2010). D) In MCF10A non-cancerous basal-like cells, progesterone-bound mPRα activates the PI3K/Akt/NFκB pathway to downregulate miR-29, which in turn upregulates KLF4, a transcription factor necessary for CSC maintenance.

Thomas, 2008) mPRα is expressed in the HeLa cervical cancer cell line (Thomas, 2008) and mPRα, mPRβ and mPRγ expression has been detected in diverse epithelial human ovarian cancer biopsies (Romero-Sánchez et al., 2008).

The expression of mPRα and mPRβ in ovarian tumors has been reported to be independent of that of intracellular PR. (Romero-Sánchez et al., 2008). It has been observed that progesterone increases cAMP production and JNK1/2 and p38 MAPK phosphorylation in SK-OV-3 ovarian-ascites cancer cells probably via mPRα (Charles et al., 2010) (Fig. 3).

Our group has recently reported that mPRα and mPRβ are expressed in the grade IV human astrocytoma-derived cell lines U251 and U87, and that both receptors are localized in cell membranes and cytoplasm (Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2015). Interestingly, we found that mPRs are differentially regulated after hormonal treatments in U87 cells: mPRα expression is downregulated after progesterone and estradiol treatments, whereas that of mPRβ is upregulated by both hormones (Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2015). This was the first study reporting the expression and hormonal regulation of these mPRs subtypes in brain cancer. Besides, by using in silico analysis we found progesterone response elements (PRE) and estrogen response elements (ERE) in the promoters of human mPRα, mPRβ and mPRγ genes (Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2015). This interesting finding suggests that mPRs regulation by progesterone and estrogen should be mediated by intracellular PR and estrogen receptors, since both of them are expressed in astrocytoma cells (González-Aguero et al., 2001; González-Arenas et al., 2012).
The fact that astrocytomas cells express both the intracellular PR and at least two mPRs subtypes opens an interesting new field of research related with the possible cross-talk between these two kinds of progesterone receptors. Besides, it has been reported that progesterone mediated regulation of proliferation, migration, and invasion of human astrocytomas cells is only partially mediated by the intracellular PR, which highlights the importance of studying the participation of mPRs in mediating progesterone actions in brain cancer (Germán-Castelán et al., 2014; Piña-Medina et al., 2016).

5. Perspectives and conclusions

Progesterone can activate intracellular and/or membrane receptors to exert its functions in normal and cancer cells. Although mPR and intracellular PR can independently act on cells, several studies suggest that a cross-talk mechanism involving both types of receptors is implicated in mediating progesterone actions (Valadez-Cosmes et al., 2015). There is increasing evidence that demonstrates the participation of mPRs in many reproductive functions, however, further studies are required to determine their role, expression and hormonal regulation in reproductive diseases such as infertility, polycystic ovary syndrome and endometriosis. Besides, investigations are required to determine if the expression ratio of mPRA/mPRB could be a marker of preterm birth, as well as the participation of the associated signaling pathway in order to identify potential therapeutic approaches against this condition. More studies are also necessary to understand mPR participation in sperm activation and the signaling pathways involved in this process.

Progesterone has a dual effect on cancer development, and the expression of its specific receptors is one of the main factors that determines its effects (Giulianelli et al., 2013). Therefore, it is of great interest to investigate the mechanisms of actions activated by specific mPRs in different hormone responsive cancer cells to elucidate the functional effects of progesterone via these receptors. This would provide the development of targeted therapies by using specific agonists or antagonists of a specific mPR, depending on the cancer type, clinical phase and
21
hormone sensitivity. Further studies are necessary to include mPRs as diagnostic and/or prognostic markers for diverse kinds of cancer.

The study of mPRs in hormone-dependent pathologies, such as reproductive diseases and cancer, is emerging as a new promising area since their activation involves new and specific ligands that regulate progesterone actions and specific signaling pathways that can be pharmacologically modulated. Although important advances have been performed in reproductive and cancer biology, there are lacking studies assessing the clinical implications of mPRs in these areas, which should be addressed in the future.
