### Abstract

Increasing evidence in recent years has demonstrated the regulatory effects of arachidonic acid and its metabolites on steroid hormone production in various steroidogenic tissues. In trophic hormone-stimulated steroidogenesis, arachidonic acid is rapidly released from phospholipids. This release is dependent upon hormone-receptor interaction and inhibition of arachidonic acid release results in an inhibition of steroidogenesis. Several of the earlier studies indicated that arachidonic acid acts at the rate-limiting step of steroid biosynthesis, the transfer of substrate cholesterol to the inner mitochondrial membrane, but the manner in which this occurred was not clear. Recently it has been demonstrated that arachidonic acid release can participate in the regulation of gene expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein which mediates cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane. These studies suggest that this fatty acid may be instrumental in transducing a signal from trophic hormone/receptor interaction to the nucleus utilizing a pathway different from the reported cyclic AMP pathway. It is possible that these two pathways cooperate and serve to co-regulate transcription factors, resulting in StAR gene expression and subsequent steroid production. This hypothesis may serve to explain and co-ordinate previous observations on the roles of cyclic AMP (cAMP) and arachidonic acid in steroid hormone biosynthesis. © 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

### 1. Introduction

Arachidonic acid is produced in cells mainly through the activation of the enzyme phospholipase A₂ (PLA₂), which catalyzes its release from phospholipids. Further arachidonic acid metabolism through one of three enzyme pathways, lipoxygenase, cyclooxygenase or cytochrome P450-dependent epoxygenase, produces various metabolites (Needleman et al., 1986; Willis and Smith, 1994). Arachidonic acid and its metabolites have been demonstrated to act as mediators or regulators in the cardiovascular system, the immune system, the central nervous system, the reproductive system and during the course of inflammation (Vane and Botting, 1994). Studies in recent years have reported on the roles of arachidonic acid and its metabolites in signal transduction (Naor, 1991; Suh et al., 1995; Haithcock et al., 1999) and in the gene expression of many important proteins (Jurivich et al., 1994; Liimatta et al., 1994; Sellmayer et al., 1997; Sessler and Ntambi, 1998). This review will focus only on what is known about the role of arachidonic acid release in steroid hormone biosynthesis. In steroid hormone production, the regulatory effects of arachidonic acid and its metabolites on steroidogenesis have been studied for more than two decades, but the mechanism whereby this fatty acid regulates steroid biosynthesis is still not clear. The existing literature will be discussed and attempts will be made to add and integrate recent findings from the laboratory which indicate that arachidonic acid is involved in signal transduction and gene expression of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and steroid production. The possibility of a two pathway co-regulation of steroid production by arachidonic acid and cyclic AMP (cAMP) in hormone-induced steroidogenesis is also discussed.

2. Arachidonic acid regulation of steroid production

Growing evidence has suggested an important role for arachidonic acid in steroid production in various steroidogenic tissues. It was reported that arachidonic acid could function as a stimulatory mediator in luteinizing hormone (LH)-stimulated progesterone production in the ovary (Wang and Leung, 1989). It also enhanced human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)- or forskolin-induced steroid production in goldfish preovulatory ovarian follicles (Van der Kraak and Chang, 1990). Arachidonic acid also induced a dose-dependent increase of progesterone and estradiol in cultured granulosa cells, theca cells or corpus luteum cells isolated from goat ovary (Band et al., 1986). In testicular Leydig cells, arachidonic acid regulated both basal and hormone-stimulated steroid production as demonstrated by the induction of dose-dependent increases of testosterone formation in rats and goldfish (Wade and Van der Kraak, 1993; Romanelli et al., 1995). This observation was strengthened when it was found that inhibition of arachidonic acid release from phospholipids inhibited LH-stimulated testosterone production in rat Leydig cells (Cooke et al., 1991). Also, a dose- and time-dependent biphasic effect of arachidonic acid on LH- or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)-induced steroid production was reported in rat Leydig cells. During the acute phase, arachidonic acid inhibited the hormone-induced steroidogenesis in the short-term, and this inhibition was shown to occur as a result of protein kinase C (PKC) activation. Thus, when PKC was down-regulated, arachidonic acid was not inhibitory, and actually served to enhance the LH- or dbcAMP-induced testosterone production (Lopez-Ruiz et al., 1992). In adrenal cells, arachidonic acid stimulation induced a dose-dependent increase of pregnenolone production (Yamazaki et al., 1996). Also, Mikami et al. (1990) demonstrated that blocking arachidonic acid metabolism in adrenal cells inhibited adrenal corticotrophic hormone (ACTH)-induced pregnenolone production, but this inhibition could be reversed by prior addition of arachidonic acid metabolites to the cells. In rat glomerulosa cells it was observed that angiotensin II (AII) stimulation released arachidonic acid from diacylglycerol (DAG), and that inhibition of this release with a DAG lipase inhibitor inhibited aldosterone production (Natarajan et al., 1990). From observations such as these, it was suggested that the mechanisms for ACTH and AII stimulated steroidogenesis may involve an increase of intracellular arachidonic acid release (Solano et al., 1987).

Although direct effects of arachidonic acid itself on steroid production were reported (Lin, 1985; Johnson et al., 1991; Romanelli et al., 1995), the involvement

of its metabolites in steroidogenesis has also been well documented. Dix et al. (1984) suggested a stimulatory effect of lipoxygenase metabolites in rat Leydig cell steroidogenesis. ACTH stimulation induced production of the 5-lipoxygenase product, 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE) in rat adrenal cells, and reduction of this metabolite through inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase by a specific inhibitor, AA861, reduced ACTH-stimulated steroid production (Hirai et al., 1985). A direct role for this metabolite was demonstrated when the reduction in steroid production was reversed by the addition of 5-HPETE (Hirai et al., 1985). Similar effects were reported in studies with a 15-lipoxygenase product in bovine adrenal cells (Yamazaki et al., 1996). Following AII stimulation, the conversion of arachidonic acid to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) has been demonstrated to be important for aldosterone production in glomerulosa cells (Natarajan et al., 1990). Also, the cyclooxygenase product, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) was reported to be capable of increasing aldosterone biosynthesis by stimulating the conversion of cholesterol to pregnenolone in glomerulosa cells (Campbell et al., 1986). Further, Wade et al. (1994) demonstrated that members of the prostaglandin E family namely, PGE1, PGE2 and PGE3 stimulated testosterone production in goldfish testis with relative potencies of PGE2 > PGE1 > PGE3. In this case, the effect of PGE2 on steroid biosynthesis may involve both transcription and translation since stimulated steroid production was inhibited by actinomycin D and cycloheximide (Mercure and Van der Kraak, 1996). The role of prostaglandin F2 alpha (PGF₂α) in steroidogenesis has been reported in the ovary where its effects on steroid production may vary according to the developmental stage of the ovarian follicles (Abayasekara et al., 1993; Vaananen et al., 1997). Stimulatory effects of the epoxygenase product, epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) on steroidogenesis were also reported in bovine adrenal cells by Nishimura et al. (1989). In human granulosa cells it was found that low dosages of EETs stimulated estradiol secretion, whereas high concentrations of EETs inhibited estradiol production (Van Voorhis et al., 1993).

3. Arachidonic acid regulation of StAR gene expression

Although regulatory effects of arachidonic acid and its metabolites on trophic hormone-induced steroid production have been clearly demonstrated, the mechanism(s) for these effects is not clear. It was reported that arachidonic acid and its metabolites appeared to regulate the rate-limiting step in steroidogenesis, namely, cholesterol transfer from outer to inner mitochondria.
chondrial membrane where the first enzyme in the steroidogenic pathway, P450 side chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc), resides. This hypothesis was strengthened when it was demonstrated that arachidonic acid and its metabolites had no effect on the activities of P450scc and 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3β-HSD) (Lopez-Ruiz et al., 1992; Mele et al., 1997). Since StAR protein has been demonstrated to play a critical role in mediating cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane in response to hormone stimulation (Clark et al., 1994; Lin et al., 1995; Stocco, 1997; Wang et al., 1998), it was reasoned that StAR may be involved in the arachidonic acid pathway as well. In a recent study we showed that arachidonic acid release is one of the requirements needed to regulate steroidogenesis and appears to do so through participation in the regulation of StAR protein expression (Wang et al., 1999a).

It is generally accepted that cAMP transduces the signal from trophic hormones, such as LH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), hCG, and ACTH, to the nucleus to induce StAR gene expression followed by translation of the StAR mRNA and subsequently increased steroidogenesis. However, LH- or dbcAMP-induced StAR protein and progesterone production in MA-10 cells were shown to be inhibited by the PLA₂ inhibitor quinacrine which blocked the release of arachidonic acid from phospholipids (Wang et al., 1999a). The inhibition in steroid production was dose-dependent, as was that of StAR protein expression. Progesterone production and StAR protein expression were almost completely inhibited by 20 μM quinacrine, and, importantly, the inhibitory effect was reversed by the addition of arachidonic acid, with both StAR protein and progesterone being restored as arachidonic acid concentration in the cells increased. Additional studies have recently demonstrated that arachidonic acid regulates StAR protein expression at the level of transcription (Wang et al., 1999b). While dibutyryl cyclic AMP stimulated StAR mRNA synthesis, inhibition of arachidonic acid release from phospholipids by the PLA₂ inhibitor, quinacrine, inhibited dbcAMP-induced StAR mRNA. This inhibition in transcription of the StAR mRNA was also reversed by co-incubation of the cells with exogenous arachidonic acid. As a further demonstration of this transcriptional level regulation, StAR promoter activity was tested using the dual-luciferase reporter assay system, and it was clearly seen that dbcAMP-induced promoter activity was significantly inhibited by quinacrine. This inhibition was also reversed by the addition of exogenous arachidonic acid (Wang et al., 1999b). These results clearly indicate that release of arachidonic acid plays an important role in LH or cAMP-induced StAR gene expression.

4. Trophic hormone-induced cyclic AMP production and arachidonic acid release

As stated above, it is well known that trophic hormone stimulation of steroidogenic cells induces the second messenger cAMP followed by activation of protein kinase A (PKA), synthesis of new proteins, cholesterol transfer to the inner mitochondrial membrane and eventually acute steroidogenesis (Marsh, 1975; Chaudhary and Stocco, 1991). However, recent studies have indicated that trophic hormones also release another second messenger, namely, arachidonic acid (reviewed in Cooke, 1999), and that this release occurs dependently or independently of cAMP formation.

Following LH stimulation, arachidonic acid is released within 1 min in rat testis Leydig cells (Cooke et al., 1991). Arachidonic acid release was reported to occur in a dose and time-dependent manner in hCG stimulated Leydig cells, with the amount of arachidonic acid released being dependent on hormone-receptor interaction and the concentration of LH/hCG binding sites on the cell surface (Moraga et al., 1997). This study further showed that cellular levels of cAMP and arachidonic acid were dependent on the concentrations of trophic hormone with low doses of hCG resulting in significant levels of arachidonic acid release while cAMP levels remained unchanged, suggesting that arachidonic acid release induced by low doses of hCG is independent of cAMP formation. Similar results were reported in ACTH-stimulated bovine adrenal cells (Yamazaki et al., 1996). It is possible that interaction of the hormone-receptor complex with G protein directly activates PLA₂ which in turn catalyses arachidonic acid release from phospholipids (Axelrod et al., 1988).

Abayasekara et al. (1990) reported that PLA₂ inhibitors caused a dose-dependent inhibition of LH-induced steroidogenesis without having effect on cAMP formation in rat Leydig cells. In MA-10 mouse Leydig tumor cells, dbcAMP-stimulated progesterone production was inhibited by a PLA₂ inhibitor and the inhibition was reversed by addition of arachidonic acid to the medium (Wang et al., 1999a). These results suggest that arachidonic acid release may occur downstream from cAMP formation and that cAMP may regulate PLA₂ activity (Piomelli and Greengard, 1991). In this regard, a 43-kDa protein (p43), since named arachidonic acid-related thioesterase involved in steroidogenesis (ARTIST), was identified and cloned from rat adrenal zona fasciculata cells. This protein is homologous to a family of novel acyl-Co-A thioesterases including a mitochondrial peroxisome-proliferator-induced thioesterase named MTE-1, and showed steroidogenic activity in an in vitro recombination assay when incubated in the presence of a cellular membrane fraction. Importantly, its activity could be inhibited by PLA₂
inhibitors. The authors suggest that ARTIST acts as an intermediary in the regulation of PLA₂ activity by cAMP and therefore plays a role in the activation of steroidogenesis by helping to mediate the release of arachidonic acid (Paz et al., 1994; Finkielstein et al., 1998a,b). Since this acyl Co-A thioesterase appears to be instrumental in arachidonic acid release it is readily apparent that its activity would be required to obtain full steroidogenesis.

## 5. A two pathway model

The manner in which arachidonic acid participates in the regulation of StAR gene expression remains unknown. The results from recent studies suggest an alternate pathway involving arachidonic acid release which in turn is involved in, via a signal transduction pathway separate from the cAMP pathway, trophic hormone-stimulated StAR gene transcription.

As mentioned earlier, inhibition of arachidonic acid release inhibited LH- and dbcAMP-induced steroid production, StAR mRNA and StAR protein synthesis. The inhibitory effects were reversed by addition of exogenous arachidonic acid and thus, suggest a role for arachidonic acid in the signal transduction from cAMP to StAR gene transcription. However, arachidonic acid alone could not induce detectable levels of StAR mRNA and protein and resulted in only slight increases in steroid hormone biosynthesis (Wang et al., 1999a). These results indicate that while arachidonic acid release is essential for the stimulation of steroid hormone biosynthesis, release in the absence of increased levels of intracellular cAMP has little or no effect on StAR gene expression. Therefore, it is possible that following stimulation of the cells with trophic hormone, cAMP levels rise and arachidonic acid is released and then the two second messengers act through two separate pathways to co-regulate StAR gene expression. In this scenario, each pathway is an essential component of the stimulatory process with the absence of either resulting in decreased steroid synthesis.

A model for the co-regulation of these two pathways in StAR gene expression and steroid production is proposed in Fig. 1. In this model, trophic hormone stimulation not only induces cAMP formation, but also arachidonic acid release, either dependently or independently of cAMP. Cyclic AMP transduces its signal through the cAMP-PKA pathway, perhaps modifying transcription factors or co-factors required to activate StAR gene transcription. Arachidonic acid and its metabolites, either directly or perhaps indirectly through an increase in Ca²⁺ release, may transduce their signal through the arachidonic acid pathway. The nature of this pathway remains to be elucidated. Further, both the cAMP-PKA pathway and arachidonic

Fig. 1. A model for signal transduction pathways mediated by cyclic AMP (cAMP) and arachidonic acid during trophic hormone-stimulated steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) gene expression and steroidogenesis. Trophic hormone stimulation induces both cAMP formation and arachidonic acid release from phospholipids, either dependently or independently of cAMP. Arachidonic acid and cAMP transduce their signals through two different pathways and may co-regulate the StAR gene by activating positive transcription factors or perhaps by releasing negative transcription factors resulting in StAR gene transcription, translation and subsequent mitochondrial cholesterol transfer and steroid production. In this model, both pathways are required for full activity, with either one alone being insufficient for StAR gene expression and maximal hormone-stimulated steroid production.

acid pathway are required for full steroidogenic activity, but neither one alone is sufficient for StAR gene expression and maximal steroid production. The transcription factors or co-factors required for StAR expression may be under the control of both pathways. It is also possible that co-regulation by these two pathways may release the repression of negative transcription factors and activate the positive factors resulting in StAR gene transcription.

The transcription factors which may be required for the response to arachidonic acid are currently under investigation in the laboratory, and it is anticipated that future studies may yield additional information on the co-regulation of steroidogenesis by these two pathways.
