### Abstract

Sulfate residues attached to the specific position of the component sugar residues of glycosaminoglycans play important roles in the formation of functional domain structures. The introduction of a sulfate group is catalyzed by various sulfotransferases with strict substrate specificities. A rapid development achieved in the cloning of various glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases has allowed us to study the biological functions of glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases and their products, sulfated glycosaminoglycans. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

### 1. Introduction

Glycosaminoglycans are composed of characteristic repeating disaccharide units with sulfate groups at various positions in various combinations. Glycosaminoglycans function in various biological systems as components of proteoglycans through the interactions with divergent molecules. In Table 1, some examples for the relation between structures and functions of glycosaminoglycans are shown. As shown in Table 1, sulfate groups attached to the specific position of glycosaminoglycan chains play important roles in the formation of biologically active domain structures. The importance of glycosaminoglycan sulfation has been recognized dramatically through the studies of 2-O-sulfation of IdoA in heparan sulfate. Structural studies showed that 2-O-sulfate group on IdoA was requisite for the binding of FGF2 to heparan sulfate [19, 20]. The sulfotransferase responsible for the sulfation of position 2 of IdoA in the IdoA-GlcNSO₃ unit (HS2ST) was purified from Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells [25] and cloned [26]. On the other hand, a mouse gene cloned by the gene trap method, mutation of which caused bilateral renal agenesis and resulted in death in the neonatal period, was found to be a mouse counterpart of HS2ST [27]. These studies clearly indicate that HS2ST regulates the interaction between heparan sulfate and FGF2 through the synthesis of IdoA (2SO₄) residues, and thereby affects the development of animals. Mutation occurring in the sulfate transporter resulted in undersulfation of proteoglycan synthesized by chondrocytes, and thereby caused lethal chondrodysplasia [28]. The *Drosophila* gene *sulfateless*, which encodes a homolog of vertebrate heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase, is essential for Wg signaling [29]. Mutations that affect the elongation and sulfation of glycosaminoglycans are shown in Table 2. Sulfate groups attached to glycosaminoglycan chains are transferred from 3′-phosphoadenosine 5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) by sulfotransferases with strict acceptor specificities. Recently, glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases with different specificities have been purified and cloned. These sulfotransferases may be classified into several groups in terms of substrate specificity and amino acid sequences. In this review, I will describe molecular cloning, substrate specificity, and possible biological function of glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases. In Table 3, glycos-

aminoglycan sulfotransferases so far purified, or cloned are listed together with their substrate specificity. Heparan sulfate sulfotransferases were previously reviewed [78]. Structure, biosynthesis and general biology of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans have been well summarized in a recent review [79].

2. Sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate

2.1. Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase

Chondroitin 6-sulfotransferase (C6ST) was purified from the serum-free culture medium of chick embryo chondrocytes [41]. The purified C6ST showed a broad protein band of 75 kDa in SDS-PAGE. Since the same size of C6ST was obtained from chicken serum, secretion of C6ST into the extracellular space seems to occur not only in the culture condition, but also in the physiological state [80]. The purified C6ST catalyzed transfer of sulfate to position 6 of GalNAc residues of chondroitin [41], position 6 of Gal residue of keratan sulfate [43] and sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharides [44]. Based on the amino acid sequence, cDNA of C6ST was cloned from chick embryo chondrocyte library [42]. The deduced protein had a type II transmembrane topology. From the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified C6ST, C6ST was thought to be secreted to the culture medium after truncated at the site within the transmembrane domain. When COS-7 cells were transfected with C6ST cDNA, sulfotransferase activities toward not only chondroitin, but also keratan sulfate and sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharide were overexpressed, indicating that a single protein derived from C6ST cDNA could sulfate both GalNAc and Gal residue [42, 44]. C6ST failed to sulfate Gal residue of sialyl Lewis X, suggesting that Fuc attached to adjacent GlcNAc may inhibit C6 sulfation of Gal residue [44]. Human C6ST cDNA was cloned from human fetal brain library [46]. Human C6ST contained a hydrophilic domain

decreased [82]. Chondroitin 6-sulfate, the product of C6ST, may play an important role in in vivo hematopoiesis, since C6ST mRNA was expressed in the bone marrow, and stromal cells in the marginal zone and red pulp of the spleen [45]. C6ST null mice were generated [38]. These mice were fertile and showed no obvious pathological phenotype, but delay of corneal healing was observed.

### 2.2. Nervous system involved sulfotransferase (NSIST)

A mAb 3B3, which recognized agrin-binding proteins, was raised using the synaptic membrane proteins as the antigen [83]. One of the epitope-bearing proteins was found to be dystroglycan. The reactivity of the mAb was decreased by the digestion with neuraminidase, but not affected by the digestion with chondroitinase or keratanase; suggesting that the epitope for the mAb may not be glycosaminoglycans, but oligosaccharides with sialic acid. NSIST cDNA was cloned from Torpedo electric organ by detecting the expression of the epitope recognized by mAb 3B3 on the surface of COS cells [84]. NSIST shows significant sequence homology to both C6ST and KSGal6ST; identity of amino acid sequence between NSIST and chick C6ST is 56% and identity of amino acid sequence between NSIST and human KSGal6ST is 38%. Such similarities in the amino acid sequence suggest that NSIST may be a novel sulfotransferase and that, in addition to sialic acid, sulfate group may be involved in the formation of the structure of the epitope for mAb 3B3. We found that transfection of NSIST cDNA in COS-7 cells resulted in the overexpression of C6ST activity (S. Mita, M. Nastuk, O. Habuchi, unpublished observation).

### 2.3. Chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase

Chondroitin 4-sulfotransferase (C4ST), which catalyzes transfer of sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residue of chondroitin, was purified from the serum-free culture medium of rat chondrosarcoma cells [48]. The purified C4ST catalyzed transfer of sulfate to position 4 of GalNAc residues of not only chondroitin, but also desulfated dermatan sulfate. When the sulfated product formed from desulfated dermatan sulfate was digested with chondroitinase ACII, about half of the product was converted to ΔDi-4S, suggesting that C4ST preferentially transferred sulfate to GlcA-rich domain present in the desulfated dermatan sulfate. It remains to be studied whether 4-O-sulfation of GalNAc residue of dermatan sulfate is catalyzed by a sulfotransferase distinct from C4ST. On the basis of the amino acid sequence of peptides obtained after endopeptidase digestion, mouse C4ST cDNA was cloned [49]. The deduced protein from the nucleotide sequence of the cDNA was a type II transmembrane protein composed of 352 amino acids. From the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the purified C4ST, C4ST secreted to the culture medium was a truncated form as observed in C6ST. When

transfected in COS-7 cells, sulfotransferase activities toward both chondroitin and desulfated dermatan sulfate were overexpressed. In adult mouse tissues, C4ST expressed mainly in kidney and brain. Mouse C4ST did not show any significant homology to other sulfotransferases so far cloned, except for sulfotransferase responsible for the formation of 3-O-sulfated GlcA contained in HNK-1 epitope. Identity of amino acid sequence between mouse C4ST and human HNK-1 sulfotransferase was 29%.

### 2.4. GalNAc(4SO₄)-6-O-sulfotransferase

Chondroitin sulfate E contains GalNAc(4,6-bisSO₄) residues, and has been assumed to participate to the formation of the granule in mast cells [10] or in the anticoagulant activity of monocytes [11]. As the key enzyme for the synthesis of chondroitin sulfate E, GalNAc(4SO₄) 6-O-sulfotransferase (GalNAc4S-6ST), which transfers sulfate to position 6 of GalNAc(4SO₄) in chondroitin sulfate and dermatan sulfate, was purified from the squid cartilage [50]. The purified enzyme transferred sulfate to chondroitin sulfate A, chondroitin sulfate C and dermatan sulfate. A low activity was observed toward squid skin chondroitin. Chondroitin sulfate E from squid cartilage, keratan sulfate, heparan sulfate and completely desulfated N-resulfated heparin hardly served as acceptors of the sulfotransferase. The transfer of sulfate to chondroitin sulfate A, dermatan sulfate and squid skin chondroitin occurred at position 6 of the internal GalNAc(4SO₄) residues and at position 6 of non-reducing terminal GalNAc(4SO₄) residues. No transfer of sulfate to position 6 of GalNAc residues was observed even when squid skin chondroitin was used as the acceptor, indicating that GalNAc4S-6ST absolutely requires the presence of GalNAc(4SO₄) residue for its activity. When dermatan sulfate was used as the acceptor, GalNAc(4SO₄) residue adjacent to IdoA was sulfated. Oligosaccharides derived from chondroitin sulfate A were sulfated by this enzyme as efficiently as chondroitin sulfate A.

### 2.5. Uronosyl 2-O-sulfotransferase

The disulfated disaccharide structure, IdoA(2SO₄)-GalNAc(4SO₄), contained in dermatan sulfate was reported to comprise heparin cofactor II binding domain [15]. Sulfotransferase which transfers sulfate to position 2 of iduronic acid residue was cloned from human lymphoma Raji cell. A cDNA fragment with a predicted amino acid sequence homologous to heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase was found in the expressed sequence-tagged data bank, and a full-length cDNA was cloned from human lymphoma Raji cell library [51]. When this cDNA was transfected in Sf9 insect cells, activity of sulfotransferase, which catalyzed transfer sulfate to dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate, was overexpressed. Chondroitin-

nase ABC digestion of ${}^{35}$S-labeled dermatan sulfate yielded a ${}^{35}$S-labeled disaccharide, whose retention time in HPLC was identical to that of standard ΔDi-diS${}_{\mathrm{B}}$. All of the ${}^{35}$S-radioactivity of the disaccharide was released as inorganic sulfate after digestion with 2-sulfatase. The ${}^{35}$S-labeled disaccharide was converted quantitatively to ΔDi-2S after digestion with 4-sulfatase. These results indicate that the expressed sulfotransferase is a novel uronosyl 2-$O$-sulfotransferase. The messages of the uronosyl 2-$O$-sulfotransferase of 5.1 and 2.0 kb were expressed in various tissues ubiquitously.

### 3. Sulfotransferases involved in the sulfation of keratan sulfate

#### 3.1. Keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase

Keratan sulfate bears sulfate at position 6 of Gal residue and position 6 of GlcNAc residue. A partially purified sulfotransferase from bovine corneal cells was reported to catalyze the transfer sulfate to desulfated keratan sulfate, but not to chondroitin [85]. Since C6ST is able to sulfate both chondroitin and keratan sulfate, an unidentified sulfotransferase with distinct substrate specificity from C6ST was expected to be present in the cornea. A cDNA was cloned from human fetal brain library by cross hybridization with chick C6ST cDNA [52]. The amino acid sequence deduced from the cDNA showed 34% identity to that of chick C6ST. When the cDNA was expressed in COS-7 cells, the activity of sulfotransferase, which sulfate keratan sulfate, was overexpressed, but activity of sulfotransferase, which sulfate chondroitin, was not increased at all. Structural analysis of ${}^{35}$S-labeled glycosaminoglycan, which was formed from keratan sulfate by the reaction with ${}^{35}$S]PAPS and the recombinant sulfotransferase, showed that keratan sulfate was sulfated at position 6 of Gal residues. On the basis of the acceptor substrate specificity, this enzyme was named as keratan sulfate Gal-6-sulfotransferase (KSGal6ST). Among various human adult tissues, 2.8 kb message of KSGal6ST was expressed in the brain [52] and several immunologically relevant tissues, such as spleen, lymph node, thymus and appendix [53]. KSGal6ST may participate in the synthesis of keratan sulfate in the cornea [52], because a message that hybridized with human KSGal6ST cDNA was expressed in the chick embryo cornea. KSGal6ST was found to catalyze the transfer of sulfate to Gal residue of sialyl lactosamine oligosaccharides and fetuin oligosaccharides [53]. The relative rate of sulfation of Neuα2-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc(6SO${}_{4}$)β1-3Gal(6SO${}_{4}$)β1-4(6SO${}_{4}$) with KSGal6ST was much higher than that of keratan sulfate. Since, when KSGal6ST cDNA was introduced into COS-7 cells together with GlyCAM-1/IgG cDNA, 6-$O$-sulfation of Gal residue of oligosaccharides attached to GlyCAM-1 occurred, it is evident that KSGal6ST could sulfate Gal residue of oligo-

saccharide in the living cells [56]. KSGal6ST may function in the reconstitution of high endothelial cell ligand for L-selectin, because, when KSGal6ST was introduced into CHO cells, which were previously transfected with fucosyltransferase VII and core 2 β1-6GlcNAc transferase, enhanced binding activity to L-selectin/IgM chimera was detected [56].

When human serum was incubated with keratan sulfate or partially desulfated keratan sulfate and ${}^{35}$S]PAPS, ${}^{35}$SO${}_{4}$ was incorporated into polysaccharide fraction. ${}^{35}$SO${}_{4}$ was exclusively incorporated into position 6 of Gal residue and no sulfation of GlcNAc residue was observed. In contrast, when a trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc, was used as an acceptor, C6-sulfation of the non-reducing terminal GlcNAc residue was observed [86]. Sulfotransferase activities acting on the non-reducing end GlcNAc residue contained in glycoproteins have been reported. Microsomal preparations from rat liver Golgi [87], human bronchial mucosa [88] and porcine lymph node [89] were found to catalyze the sulfation of non-reducing terminal GlcNAc residues and showed no activity when the GlcNAc residue was substituted with Gal. Taken together, sulfation of GlcNAc residue of not only oligosaccharides, but also keratan sulfate may occur only when the targeted GlcNAc is located at the non-reducing terminal of sugar chains. GlcNAc 6-$O$-sulfotransferases has been cloned [54,55]. This enzyme transferred sulfate to position 6 of non-reducing end of GlcNAc residue of a trisaccharide, GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc, but showed no activity toward a tetrasaccharide, Galβ1-4GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc. This enzyme was shown to be involved in the biosynthesis of sulfated sialyl $N$-acetylactosamine and sulfated sialyl Lewis X structure [54,55]. When murine GlcNAc 6-$O$-sulfotransferases cDNA was introduced to human endothelial cell line ECV 304 together with FucTVII cDNA, L-selectin ligand activity on the cells was markedly increased [90]. However, it is not clear at present whether GlcNAc 6-$O$-sulfotransferase is involved in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate. Macular corneal dystrophy (MCD) is an autosomal recessive inheritance disorder which accompanies corneal opacity. Corneal fibroblasts of MCD type I patients were reported to synthesize nearly normal amounts of the fully glycosylated core proteins of KSPG, but fail to sulfate poly-$N$-acetyllactosamine backbone structures [16]. The level of GlcNAc 6-$O$-sulfotransferase activity, which was measured by using GlcNAcβ1-3Galβ1-4GlcNAc as an acceptor, was much lower in type I MCD cornea than in control cornea [91], but was nearly equal between control and type I MCD when the activity in the serum was measured [86]. These results suggest that there may be a cornea-specific GlcNAc 6-$O$-sulfotransferase that was involved in the keratan sulfate synthesis.

3.3. HEC-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase (or LSST) and I-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase

Another sulfotransferase which sulfate 6-O position of GlcNAc residue (HEC-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase or LSST) was cloned. This sulfotransferase showed 35% identity in amino acid sequence to GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase described above and its expression was highly restricted to HEVs [56, 57]. HEC-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase was also shown to be involved in the reconstitution of high endothelial cell ligand for L-selectin. It is of note that KSGal6ST and HEC-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase functioned synergistically [56]. It is also not investigated about the possibility that HEC-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase may be involved in the biosynthesis of keratan sulfate. A third member of GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase, which is highly restricted to intestinal tissue, was cloned [58]. The predicted amino acid sequence of this sulfotransferase (I-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase) was shown to be 55% identical to HEC-GlcNAc 6-O-sulfotransferase and 35% identical to KSGal6ST. When COS-7 cells were transfected with this cDNA together with GlyCAM-1 cDNA, and metabolically labeled with ${}^{35}$SO₄, 6-sulfation of GlcNAc residues contained in the sugar chain of GlyCAM-1 was observed.

4. Sulfotransferases involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate/heparin

4.1. Heparan sulfate N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase

N-deacetylation and N-sulfation of GlcNAc residue of heparan sulfate/heparin are catalyzed by N-deacetylase/N-sulfotransferase (NDST), which is comprised of a single polypeptide chain, and are prerequisite for all of other modifications such as C-5 epimerization of GlcA to L-IdoA, 2-O-sulfation of the uronic acid residues, and 6-O-and 3-O-sulfation of glucosamine residues. Three NDSTs have been cloned. Recently, the fourth NDST has been reported [66]. NDST-1 was purified from rat liver to homogeneity [59]. The purified NDST-1 was a protein with 97 kDa and transferred sulfate to heparan sulfate, N-desulfated heparan sulfate, N-desulfated heparin, but not to N-acetylheparan sulfate, N-acetyl heparin, chondroitin, and chondroitin sulfate. From the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, NDST-1 was cloned [60]. Northern blot analysis showed the expression of three transcripts, two dominant mRNA with 8.5 kb and 7.0 kb and a minor species with 4.2 kb. Since the recombinant proteins obtained by expressing this cDNA had both N-deacetylase activity and N-sulfotransferase activity, it became evident that a single polypeptide could catalyze the both enzyme reactions [92]. NDST-2 was purified from heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma [62]. Molecular mass of the purified enzyme was 110 kDa. From the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, NDST-2 was cloned [63]. NDST-2 was also cloned independently from MST cells derived from mastocytoma on the basis of the sequence homology with NDST-1 [64]. On Northern blot analysis, the NDST-2 transcript of 3.8 kb was strongly observed in heparin-producing MST cells [64]. The cells derived from embryonic bovine trachea, a tissue that does not synthesize heparin, was reported to have the enzyme classified to NDST-2 from the amino acid sequence [93]. N-Sulfotransferase activity of NDST-1 was localized to carboxyl-terminal half of the polypeptide, since the carboxyl-terminal chimera half was able to catalyze the N-sulfation of glucosamine of heparan sulfate [94]. Specificity of rat liver NDST-1 was different from that of MST cell NDST-2; the extent of N-sulfation of heparan sulfate was 40% for NDST-1 and 80% for NDST-2 [95, 96]. Using human and mouse multiple tissue Northern blot, ~8 kb mRNA of NDST-1 and ~4 kb mRNA of NDST-2 were found to have wide tissue distribution [61, 97, 98]. Expression of NDST-1 was decreased in CHO cell mutant, pgsE-606, which was shown to be partially defective in N-sulfation of heparan sulfate, while the expression of both NDST-1 and NDST-2 was observed in the wild type CHO cells [65]. NDST-3 was found by searching the EST data base using nucleotide sequence homologous to human NDST-1, and cloned [65]. Expression pattern of NDST-3 determined by RT-PCR was quite different from those of NDST-1 and NDST-2. Mice carrying a targeted disruption of the gene encoding NDST-2 were generated [39, 40]. Although these mice were fertile and showed no obvious pathological phenotype, the synthesis of heparin was absent in the peritoneal cells including mast cells, and the connective-tissue-type mast cells of these mice had altered morphology and contained reduced amount of histamine and mast-cell proteases. These results suggest that NDST-2 may be mainly involved in the synthesis of heparin in the mast cells. Drosophila gene *sulfateless*, which encodes a homolog of vertebral heparan sulfate NDST, was reported to be essential for Wg signaling [29].

4.2. Heparan sulfate 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST)

Heparin-binding growth factors, such as FGF2 and HGF recognize unique domain structure in heparan sulfate (Table 1). Heparan sulfate glucosaminyl 6-O-sulfotransferase (HS6ST) and heparan sulfate iduronyl 2-O-sulfotransferase (HS2ST) catalyzed the key reactions for the formation of such domain structures. HS6ST was purified to apparent homogeneity from the serum-free culture medium of CHO cells [67]. The purified enzyme catalyzed transfer of sulfate to CDSNS-heparin. Heparan sulfate served as an acceptor as well. N-Desulfated heparin was a poor acceptor. N-Sulfated heparosan, which was prepared from E. coli K5 heparosan, a polysaccharide comprised of disaccharide repeating unit, GlcAβ1-4Glc-
NAcα1-4, served as good acceptor. Chondroitin and chondroitin sulfate did not serve as acceptors at all. Structural analysis of the products showed that the purified HS6ST transferred sulfate to position 6 of GlcNSO₃ residue in IdoAα1-4GlcNSO₃ or IdoA(2SO₄)α1-4GlcNSO₃. HS6ST could not transfer sulfate to GlcNAc residue, suggesting that sulfation of GlcNAc residue may be catalyzed by a different sulfotransferase from HS6ST. On the basis of amino acid sequence of the purified HS6ST, a partial cDNA was cloned from CHO cells [68]. A cDNA containing whole open reading frame was cloned from human brain library by using the CHO cDNA as a probe. Northern analysis showed that 3.9 kb mRNA was expressed in human brain. Three isoforms of HS6ST with different specificities and different expression patterns were isolated from mouse brain library [69]. HS6ST-1 showed 96% identity in amino acid sequence to the human HS6ST, and thought to be a mouse counterpart to HS6ST. Identities of amino acid sequence in HS6ST-2 and -3 to HS6ST were 50 and 55%, respectively. These three mouse recombinant enzymes share the acceptor specificity in that these enzyme transfer sulfate to position 6 of GlcNSO₃ residues. However, each isoform showed the different specificity toward the isomeric hexuronic acid adjacent to the targeted N-sulfoglucosamine; HS6ST-1 appeared to prefer iduronosyl N-sulfoglucosamine unit, while HS6ST-2 had the different substrate preference depending upon the concentration of substrate and HS6ST-3 acted on either substrate. All three isoforms failed to sulfate position 6 of GlcNAc residue, suggest the presence of distinct enzymes involved in the synthesis of GlcAβ1-4GlcNAc(6SO₄). Northern blot analysis showed that the expression pattern of each message in various tissues was characteristic of the respective isoform. The transcript of HS6ST-1 with 3.9 kb was expressed strongly in liver, and that of HS6ST-2 with 4.6 kb was expressed mainly in brain and spleen. In contrast, the transcript of HS6ST-3 was expressed rather ubiquitously in various tissues. These results suggest that the expression of these isoforms may be regulated in tissue-specific manners, and that each isoform may be involved in the synthesis of heparan sulfates with tissue-specific structures and functions.

### 4.3. Heparan sulfate 2-sulfotransferase

HS2ST catalyzes the sulfation of position 2 of IdoA residue in heparan sulfate and is essential for the synthesis of FGF2 binding structure. HS6ST was secreted to the culture medium of CHO cells as described above, but almost HS2ST activity was retained in the cell layer. From the extracts of CHO cells, HS2ST was purified [25]. CDSNS-heparin and heparan sulfate from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm mouse tumor served as good acceptors. From the structural analysis of the sulfated products when these glycosaminoglycans were used as acceptor, HS2ST catalyzed the transfer of sulfate to position 2 of

IdoA residue of IdoAα1-4GlcNSO₃ units, but not to IdoA of IdoAα1-4GlcNSO₃(6SO₄) unit. On the basis of the amino acid sequence of the purified enzyme, HS2ST was cloned from CHO cell cDNA library [26]. Northern blot analysis showed that messages of 5.0 and 3.0 kb were expressed in the CHO cells. As observed in the purified enzyme, the recombinant HS2ST also transferred sulfate to position 2 of IdoA of IdoA-GlcNSO₃, but not to position 2 of IdoA of IdoA-GlcNSO₃(6SO₄). The recombinant HS2ST showed weak, but significant, activity toward N-sulfated heparasan. Structural analysis of the sulfated products indicated the sulfation of position 2 of GlcA residue. A CHO cell mutant, pgsF-17, which was shown to be defective in 2-O-sulfation of iduronic acid of heparan sulfate, was isolated [99]. Heparan sulfate synthesized by the mutant cells lacked not only IdoA(2SO₄)-GlcNSO₃ and IdoA(2SO₄)-GlcNSO₃(6SO₄), but also GlcA(2SO₄)-GlcNSO₃. These observations suggest that a single HS2ST may catalyze the sulfation of both IdoA and GlcA. When the mutant cells and wild CHO cells were metabolically labeled with ³⁵SO₄, heparan sulfate in the intracellular pool was not degraded in the mutant cells, but was transformed into smaller sized chains in the wild CHO cells. When HS2ST cDNA was introduced into the mutant cell, the activity of degradation of the heparan sulfate was recovered [100]. These observations suggest an important role of 2-O-sulfation in the degradation of heparan sulfate. Considering the specificity of HS6ST and HS2ST, IdoA(2SO₄)-GlcNSO₃(6SO₄) may be synthesized by a sequential reactions; IdoA residues are initially 2-O-sulfated and then GlcNSO₃ residue are 6-O-sulfated (Fig. 1).

A gene trap mutation in the gene encoding HS2ST was generated [27]. Mice homozygous for the HS2ST gene trap allele exhibited bilateral renal agenesis, resulting from a failure of uteric bud branching and mesenchymal condensation, and defects of the eye and skeleton. These data demonstrate the important function of 2-O-sulfation of heparan sulfate in vertebral embryonic development. Expression of pipe in the somatic tissues of the *Drosophila* ovary is required for the formation of embryonic dorsal-ventral polarity. Molecular cloning of pipe revealed that pipe encodes two isoforms of a protein with amino acid similarity to the HS2ST [37]. This finding suggests the important role of sulfation of heparan sulfate in the regulation of dorsal-ventral polarity determination in the *Drosophila* embryo.

### 4.4. Heparan sulfate glucosaminyl 3-O-sulfotransferase (3-OST)

3-OST is an essential enzyme for the production of antithrombin III binding domain in heparan sulfate and heparin. This enzyme activity was detected in microsomal fractions of heparin-producing mouse mastocytoma [101]. Purification of 3-OST became possible due mainly
Fig. 1. A possible biosynthetic pathway of heparan sulfate. Sulfotransferases so far cloned, which are involved in the synthesis of heparan sulfate, are boxed. Glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of heparan sulfate are also shown in the top of this figure: EXT1 and EXT2 [35], EXTL2 [36], GlcAT-I [105, 106] and GalT-I [107, 108]. The mechanism of the synthesis of IdoA(2SO3)-GlcN, which served as acceptor for 3-OST-3A and -3B, is not known. This figure was made by modification of the figure in [78].

to the development of a highly sensitive assay method, in which 3-OST activity was detected as an activity converting HS<sup>act</sup> precursor to HS<sup>act</sup> in the presence of PAPS [102]. 3-OST was purified to homogeneity from the serum-free culture medium of the LTA cell clone 33+ [70]. 3-OST transferred sulfate from PAPS to position 3 of GlcNSO<sub>3</sub> and GlcNSO<sub>3</sub>(6SO<sub>4</sub>) of HS<sup>act</sup> precursor and HS<sup>inact</sup> precursor to produce HS<sup>act</sup> and HS<sup>inact</sup>. The structure of precursor hexasaccharides contained in HS<sup>act</sup> precursor, to which sulfate was transferred by 3-OST, possessed all the elements for antithrombin binding except for the 3-O-sulfate moiety. In contrast, the precursor hexasaccharides contained in HS<sup>inact</sup> precursor showed structural variation; GlcNAc(6SO<sub>4</sub>) and IdoA(2SO<sub>4</sub>), which reside in the non-reducing side and reducing side, respectively, of the targeted GlcNSO<sub>3</sub>, were not conserved but changed to different component residues [103]. These observations suggest that the synthesis of antithrombin III-binding domain may require the concerted reaction of N-sulfation, 6-O- and 2-O-sulfation and uronosyl epimerization. On the basis of the amino acid sequence, 3-OST-1 was cloned [71]. The protein predicted from the cDNA contained hydrophobic domain at the N-terminal sequence, but it was assumed that, unlike all other glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases, this protein was not a type II transmembrane protein, but an intralumenal protein. Unexpectedly, this protein showed 50% identity in the amino acid sequence with NDST-1. The recombinant protein expressed in COS-7 cells was confirmed to catalyze the formation of antithrombin III-binding domain, because this enzyme transferred sulfate to position 3 of GlcNSO<sub>3</sub> adjacent to the reducing side of GlcA. Northern blot analysis showed that three sizes of mRNA (1.7, 2.3, and 3.3 kb) were expressed in mouse and rat, and single size species (1.7 kb) were

expressed in human. Four additional 3-OST (3-OST-2, 3-OST-3A, 3-OST-3B, and 3-OST-4) have been cloned [72]. Activity of 3-OST-4 was not determined because of partial cDNA. Unlike 3-OST-1, the proteins expressed in COS-7 cells could not catalyze the formation of HS<sup>act</sup> residue. 3-OST-2 transfers sulfate to GlcA(2SO<sub>4</sub>)-GlcNSO<sub>3</sub> and IdoA(2SO<sub>4</sub>)-GlcNSO<sub>3</sub> [73]; 3-OST-3A transfers sulfate to IdoA(2SO<sub>4</sub>)-GlcN [74]. These three 3-OST isoforms showed different expression pattern in Northern blot analysis. 3-OST-1 was expressed in the brain, kidney and heart. 3-OST-2 was expressed strongly in the brain. 3-OST-3A and 3-OST-3B were expressed in various tissues. IdoA(2SO<sub>4</sub>)-GlcNSO<sub>3</sub>(3SO<sub>4</sub>), which is one of products of 3-OST-2, was found in the heparan sulfate from glomerular basement membrane, and thought to be involved in the regulation of the renal filtration of protein [104]. GlcA(2SO<sub>4</sub>)β1-4GlcNSO<sub>3</sub>(3SO<sub>4</sub>), which is another product of 3-OST-2, has not so far been found in natural heparan sulfate, and it is quite interesting how such a novel structure functions. A mouse version of 3-OST-3B was found to make cells that are resistant to herpes simplex virus type-1 (HSV-1) entry susceptible to HSV-1 entry. This finding indicates that heparan sulfate bearing 3-O-sulfate on specific glucosamine residues is required for the entry of HSV-1 [75].

From the substrate specificities of various heparan sulfate sulfotransferases described above, a possible biosynthetic pathway of heparan sulfate is shown in Fig. 1. In Fig. 1, current information about glycosyltransferases involved in the biosynthesis of protein-glycosaminoglycan linkage region and repeating disaccharide backbone of heparan sulfate is also shown.

5. Phylogenetic relationship of the glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferase genes

Glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases could be classified to five groups according to the similarity in amino acid sequences (Fig. 2). Group 1 includes 3-OST-1, -2, -3A, -3B and NDST-1, -2, -3; group 2 includes C6ST, NSIST, KSGal6ST, GlcNAc6ST and HEC-GlcNAc6ST; group 3 includes C4ST and HNK-1ST; group 4 includes HS2ST, UA2OST, Sd protein and pipeST; and group 5 includes HS6ST-1, -2, -3. It is of note that C6ST and C4ST seem to be coded by phylogenically independent genes, although these sulfotransferase are involved in the biosynthesis of the common glycosaminoglycans. Sulfotransferases included in group 2 showed common specificity that these sulfotransferases transferred sulfate to position 6 of sugar residues. However, it is generally difficult to find an obvious relationship between acceptor substrate specificity and phylogenetic correlation. Both 3-OST and NDST recognize glucosamine as acceptor, but the position to which sulfate is transferred is different. In the case of C4ST and HNK-1ST, both sugar residues and position to which sulfate is transferred are quite different from each other. Crystallographic studies on sulfotransferases may reveal the common motifs in the structures of the acceptor which appear independent of each other.

5'-PBS and 3'-PB represent 5'-phosphosulfate binding site and 3'-phosphate binding site, respectively. Conserved amino acid residues are shown in the bold letters. This table was made by modification of the tables in [109, 110].

6. Structure and function of glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases

Two putative PAPS binding sites were pointed out by X-ray crystallography of estrogen sulfotransferase performed in the presence of PAP; one is KSGTTWL for 5′-phosphosulfate binding site (5′-PSB) and another is RX₇S for 3′-phosphate binding site (3′-PB) [109]. These motif sequences could be found in most of glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases so far cloned as shown in Table 4. From the X-ray crystallography of NDST-1, these motif sequences were shown to comprise strikingly similar structure to the PAP binding domain of estrogen sulfotransferase, and K614, T615, G616, T617 and T618 in 5′-PSB domain were all within hydrogen bonding distance of the 5′-phosphate [111]. Mutation of K614 to Ala abolished N-sulfotransferase activity [112]. Functional roles of 5′-PSB and 3′-PB domain was studied in more detail in HNK-1 sulfotransferase; mutation of K128 in the 5′-PSB domain and R189, D190, P191, S197 in the 3′-PB domain to Ala all abolished the sulfotransferase activity, indicating important catalytic roles of these amino acid residues [110].

be studied. Purification, cloning and characterization of new sulfotransferases may bring new findings about the function of glycosaminoglycans.

7. Perspectives

Recent development in glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases has revealed the presence of divergent sulfotransferases with strict substrate specificity. These sulfotransferases are involved in the biosynthesis of various biologically active domain structures singly or in combination with other sulfotransferases and modifying enzymes. Molecular cloning of the sulfotransferases opened a new horizon in the research area on the function of glycosaminoglycans at the level of whole animals. As shown in sulfateless mutation or the gene trap mutation in the gene encoding HS2ST, deletion of a single sulfotransferase was shown to bring severe retardation in the development of animals. Generation of mice carrying a targeted disruption of the gene encoding glycosaminoglycan sulfotransferases will provide valuable information about the function of glycosaminoglycans as shown in NDST-2 knock out mice. Biological significance of sulfation of sugar residues other than glycosaminoglycans is also becoming clear [113]. Cloning of sulfotransferases which are involved in the formation of L-selectin ligand has suggested that sulfation of sugar residues of glycoproteins and sulfation of glycosaminoglycan may be catalyzed by the same sulfotransferases or by sulfotransferases evolved from the common ancestral gene. It may be possible that a sulfotransferase with a novel specificity still exists in the various tissues as observed in the sulfotransferase which sulfate C6 position of GalNAc residue of dermatan sulfate [114]. The mechanism of the 6-O-sulfation of GlcNAc residue of heparan sulfate also remains to
