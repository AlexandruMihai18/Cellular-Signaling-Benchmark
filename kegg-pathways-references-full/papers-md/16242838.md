### Abstract

The NTRK1 gene encodes the high affinity receptor for Nerve Growth Factor, and its action regulates neural development and differentiation. Deregulation of NTRK1 activity is associated with several human disorders. Loss of function mutations causes the genetic disease congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA). Constitutive activation of NTRK1 has been detected in several tumor types. An autocrine loop involving NTRK1 and NGF is associated with tumor progression in prostate carcinoma and in breast cancer. A novel alternative splicing variant with constitutive oncogenic potential has been recently described in neuroblastoma. Somatic rearrangements of NTRK1, producing chimeric oncogenes with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity, have been detected in a consistent fraction of papillary thyroid tumors.

The topic of this review is a detailed analysis of the thyroid TRK oncogenes. The modalities of their activation, their mechanism of action, the contribution of activating sequences, and the molecular mechanisms underlying their generation will be discussed.

### 1. NTRK1 proto-oncogene

NTRK1 (also known as TRKA) is a member of the tyrosine kinase neurotrophin receptor family that includes NTRK2 (TRKB) and NTRK3 (TRKC). NTRK1 is the preferred receptor for nerve growth factor (NGF) and is critical for development,

maturation of central, and peripheral nervous system, regulating proliferation, differentiation and programmed cell death [1]. In addition to neurotrophic functions, NGF/NTRK1 signaling also stimulates proliferation of a number of cell types such as lymphocytes, keratinocytes and prostate cells [2–4]. NTRK1 was originally isolated from a human colon carcinoma as a transforming oncogene activated by a somatic rearrangement that fused a non-muscle tropomyosin gene to the kinase domain of a novel tyrosine kinase receptor [5]. Cloning of the full-length gene [6] and identification of the NGF as a ligand occurred few years later [1,7].

The NTRK1 gene is located on chromosome 1q21-22 [8] and consists of 17 exons distributed within a 25 kb region [9]. The NTRK1 receptor is a transmembrane glycosylated protein of 140 kDa, comprising extracellular, transmembrane, and intracellular domains. The extracellular domain contains two cysteine-rich, leucine-rich and two immunoglobulin-like regions [10,11]. Transmembrane and juxtamembrane domains play a critical role in signal internalization and transduction [12,13]. The intracellular domain contains a juxtamembrane region, a tyrosine kinase domain and a C-terminal tail. Following NGF binding, NTRK1 undergoes dimerization and autophosphorylation of five tyrosine residues (Y490, Y670, Y674, Y675, and Y785), which act as phosphorylation-dependent binding sites for Shc, GRB2, FRS2, PI3K, and PLCγ. These interactions induce the Ras/MAPK and PI3K signal cascades, which culminate in the induction of genes mediating NGF effects on proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis [14].

tumor progression [3], and tumor growth can be blocked by NTRK1 kinase inhibitors [21]. Recently, an autocrine NGF/NTRK1 loop has been demonstrated in breast cancer cells, thus looking promising as potential drug target [22].

In human neuroblastoma, expression of NTRK1 is a good prognostic marker, most likely because its signaling is important for growth arrest and/or differentiation of the neural crest derived cells from which these tumors originate [23]. A novel hypoxia-regulated mechanism, converting NTRK1 in a tumor promoter in neuroblastoma has been recently identified. Hypoxia produces the oncogenic TRKAIII splice variant, lacking Ig-like and cistein-rich domains, with constitutive tyrosine kinase activity and PI3K/AKT/NF-κB but not RAS/MAPK signaling. TRKAIII antagonizes the growth arrest and differentiation induced by NGF/TRKA signaling, thus providing a tumor-promoting switch [24].

Despite the evidence that NTRK1 can be activated as an oncogene, no NTRK1 missense mutations leading to ligand-independent activation have been so far reported. Moreover, the introduction of missense mutations releasing the oncogenic potential of other RTKs showed a distinct effect on NTRK1 receptor. This suggests that, despite the high degree of conservation of certain amino acid residues, the NTRK1 receptor diverges from other RTKs in terms of tri-dimensional structure and have a distinct auto-inhibitory mechanism [25].

2. NTRK1 in human diseases

Deregulation of NTRK1 activity is associated with several human diseases. Mutations affecting different NTRK1 domains and causing loss of activity are associated with congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis (CIPA), a rare recessive genetic disease characterized by loss of pain and temperature sensation, defects in thermal regulation and occasionally mental retardation [15]. CIPA mutations cause the inactivation of NTRK1 receptor through at least three different mechanisms: (i) complete inactivation, (ii) protein processing alteration, and (iii) reduction of receptor activity [16–19].

NTRK1 gain of function mutations causing ligand-independent receptor activation have been described in some human tumors. Chimeric oncogenes produced by genomic rearrangements have been detected in a consistent fraction of human papillary thyroid carcinoma, and they will be described later. Constitutive activation of the NTRK1 receptor by a 75 amino acids deletion in the extracellular domain has been detected in a patient with acute myeloid leukaemia [20]. In prostatic carcinoma an autocrine loop involving NGF and NTRK1 is responsible for

3. Thyroid TRK oncogenes

Papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC), the most frequent neoplasia originating from the thyroid epithelium, accounts for about 80% of all thyroid cancers [26]. A consistent fraction of PTC harbors chimeric oncogenes created by chromosomal rearrangements involving prevalently RET and, to a less extent, NTRK1 loci [27]. Recently, the BRAF V599E mutation, increasing its basal kinase activity, has been identified as the most common genetic lesion in PTC with frequency ranging from 29 to 69% [28–30].

Both RET and TRK oncogenes have been discovered in our laboratory by DNA transfection/ focus formation assay in NIH3T3 cells, starting frompapillary thyroid tumor DNA. Transforming activity correlated with the presence of human RET and TRK sequences in the mouse transfectants DNA [31]; this provided the basis for the isolation and characterization of the chimeric oncogenes, containing the receptor tyrosine kinase domain preceded by activating sequences from different genes.

The TRK oncogenes isolated from papillary thyroid tumors differ in the activating genes and are reported in Fig. 1. The most frequent oncogene is TRK [32], identical to that first isolated from colon carcinoma, and containing sequences from the TPM3 gene on chromosome 1q22-23 [33]. TRK-T1 and TRK-T2 are activated by different portions of TPR gene on chromosome 1q25 [34–36]. TRK-T3 is activated by TFG, a novel gene on chromosome 3q11-12 [37]. The NTRK1-derived portion is variable in the different oncogenes, and includes the transmembrane domain in all of them but TRK-T1.

The activating sequences contain domains promoting protein dimerization/multimerization that cause the constitutive, ligand-independent tyrosine kinase activity of TRK oncoproteins. In experimental models, TRK oncoproteins recapitulate the biological effects of the NTRK1 receptor upon NGF stimulation. In fact, they induce morphological transformation of NIH3T3 mouse fibroblasts, and neuronal-like differentiation of PC12 cells [38]. The intracellular

mechanisms by which TRK oncogenes mediate their effects have been in part elucidated. TRK oncproteins interact with and activate PLCγ, Shc, FRS2, FRS3, IRS1 and IRS2. All of these molecules, except PLCγ, are recruited by the same tyrosine residue, corresponding to Tyr490 of NTRK1, most likely in a competitive fashion. Such interaction site is crucial for oncogenic activity, in so far its mutation to phenylalanine completely abrogate TRK oncogene biological activity. Moreover, by using a Shc dominant-negative mutant unable to recruit GRB2, we showed a crucial role of Shc adaptor in TRK-T3 biological activity. Conversely, mutation of the PLCγ interaction site did not affect the oncogenic activity. It is worth noting that our studies on TRK oncoproteins signal transduction allowed the identification of novel proteins interacting with NTRK1 kinase, such as IRS1, IRS2 and FRS3 [39–41].

### 4. TRK activating sequences and their role in oncogenic activation

Chimeric TRK oncogenes can be formed by DNA rearrangements juxtaposing the NTRK1 TK domain to sequences of at least three different genes: TPM3, TPR and TFG. The capability of these genes to activate chimeric tyrosine kinase oncogenes is not

restricted to NTRK1; in fact, they have been found fused to other kinase genes. TPM3 and TFG were reported to fuse to ALK in anaplastic large cell lymphoma [42, 43]. Moreover, TFG has been recently detected as a novel fusion partner of NORI in extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma [44]. TPR was first identified as part of the MET oncogene in HOS cells, fused to the TK domain of the hepatocyte growth factor receptor [45]; subsequently it was detected fused to the RAF oncogene during the transfection of a rat hepatocarcinoma [46]. Interestingly, TPR and TFG were first identified in rearranged, oncogenic versions. TPM3 gene encodes a non-muscle tropomyosin isoform. TPR gene encodes a large protein of the nuclear pore complex involved in mRNA export through the formation of complexes with different interacting proteins [47]. TFG encodes a protein of still unknown function, but some implications on its physiological role have been produced by studies on TRK-T3 oncogene (see later).

Despite the diversity in structure and function, all the NTRK1 activating proteins contain coiled-coil domains, characterized by heptad repeats with the occurrence of apolar residues preferentially in the first (a) and fourth (d) positions. This confers to the proteins the capability to fold into α-helices that is wound into a superhelix, and to form dimers/multimers [48].

TPM3 contains numerous, overlapping coiled-coil domains. Several coiled-coil domains are present in TPR, and two of them fall in the region

contained in MET and TRK-T1 oncogenes. It has been reported that mutations within the first coiled-coil domain drastically reduces MET transforming activity [49]. TFG contains a single coiled-coil domain, of approximately three heptads, shorter than typical coiled-coil domains. However, the presence of a hydrophobic residue in position a, would increase the strength of association, despite the short length [37]. The contribution of TFG coiled-coil domain to TRK-T3 oncogenic activation has been elucidated by studies employing mutants where the domain was either deleted or mutated at leucine residues in position d of each heptad. We have demonstrated that coiled-coil domain plays a crucial role in TRK-T3 oncogenic activation by mediating oncoprotein complexes formation, an essential step for tyrosine kinase activation. Our studies support the model by which coiled-coil domains mediate protein oligomerization of RTK oncogenes leading to constitutive, ligand-independent tyrosine kinase activity [50]. The TFG coiled-coil domain is predicted to fold into trimers. By size-exclusion chromatography, we have demonstrated that the wild type TRK-T3 protein is part of high molecular weight complexes, compatible with the assembly of six oncoproteins molecules, or including other proteins. However, the precise composition of TRK-T3 complexes remains to be determined [51].

An attractive hypothesis is the possibility that sequences activating tyrosine kinase chimeric

oncogenes may contribute with other functions, beside dimerization. Furthermore, since the oncogenic rearrangements disabled one allele of the activating gene, the reduced activity of the corresponding protein could play a role in thyroid carcinogenesis. We challenged this concept using the thyroid TRK-T3 oncogene, which represents an attractive model for the following reasons: (1) the function of the activating portion, TFG, remains to be unveiled; (2) TFG is involved in oncogenic rearrangement in different tumor types; (3) the TFG portion contained in TRK-T3 display a single, short coiled-coil domain, corresponding to 14% of the amino acid residues; (4) TFG might interact with other proteins (see later). A schematic representation of the TFG portion in the context of TRK-T3 oncogene is shown in Fig. 2.

TFG gene is ubiquitously expressed in human adult tissues and it is conserved among several species, including *C. elegans*. Beside the coiled-coil domain, the TFG protein also contains putative phosphorylation sites for PKC and CK2, glycosylation sites, as well SH2- and SH3-binding sites. Several of these sites are identical in TFG proteins from different species, indicating that the protein might be involved in basic cell processes [52]. A PB1 domain, a novel module mediating protein oligomerization [53] has been recently identified within the TFG N-terminal portion [51]. The regions outside the coiled-coil domain give a great contribution to TRK-T3 activation. When deleted, complexes formation is unaffected; however, transforming activity is reduced to different extent. The notion that proteins interacting with TFG might play a role in TRK-T3 oncogenic activity was supported by studies employing point mutants: TRK-T3 transforming activity was abrogated by mutating the conserved lysine residue within the PB1 domain, and was significantly reduced by the mutation of the tyrosine 33 residue within a putative binding motif for the SH2 domain of SHP-1 phosphatase [51]. In a recent work, we have provided the first evidence for TFG involvement in a cellular pathway by demonstrating that TFG is a partner of SHP-1 phosphatase. The interaction is mediated by tyrosine 33 of TFG and SH2 domains of SHP-1. TFG acts as a negative regulator of SHP-1, being able to reduce the phosphatase activity [54].

### 5. Molecular mechanisms underlying oncogenic NTRK1 rearrangements

The type of chromosomal rearrangement generating TRK oncogenes is not documented, since no cytogenetic studies are available for tumors carrying NTRK1 rearrangements. A t(1;3)(q21;q11) translocation is most likely responsible for the generation of TRK-T3 oncogene (TFG/NTRK1 rearrangement). For TRK, TRK-T1 and TRK-T2, produced by rearrangements with genes located on the q arm of chromosome 1, similarly to NTRK1, the most likely mechanism is chromosome inversion; this is supported by the presence in the tumor DNA of the reciprocal products of the rearrangement, and the evidence that NTRK1 has transcriptional orientation opposite to that of TPM3 and TPR [55].

Despite the high frequency of chromosomal rearrangements in papillary thyroid tumors, the molecular bases underlying the predisposition of thyrocytes to undergo chromosome rearrangements are not completely understood. The intrinsic capacity of a cell to repair DNA double strand breaks might contribute to chromosomal rearrangements. On the other hand, several recent reports have proposed that the spatial proximity of translocation-prone gene loci may favor gene rearrangements, thus proposing spatial genome topology as a contributing factor in the formation of specific cancerous chromosomal translocations.

With respect to thyroid-specific TRK oncogenes, sequence analysis of the genomic breakpoints revealed the presence of short sequence homology between the rearranging genes [35,56]. Moreover, the rearrangements are conservative, showing only small deletion/insertion with respect to the germline sequences of the rearranging genes. All these features suggest that the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) mechanism, capable to repair DNA double strand breaks produced by ionizing radiations or carcinogens, may be involved in the generation of TRK oncogenes. The NHEJ pathway is activated by ionizing radiations, and this is consistent with the association of PTC with therapeutic or accidental radiation exposure. Interestingly, it has been reported that thyrocytes respond to ionizing radiations by increasing the DNA end-joining activity, unlike other cell types. Therefore, following DNA damage, thyrocytes would be more prone to DNA

repair than to apoptosis, and this would increase the likelihood of gene rearrangements [57].

The concept that loci proximity may favor tissue-specific chromosomal rearrangements has been demonstrated in different contexts, including the H4/RET rearrangement in PTCs. Nikiforova et al. have proposed that the spatial contiguity of H4 and RET loci, both located on chromosome 10, in thyroid interphase nuclei, may provide the structural basis for the chromosomal inversion generating the thyroid H4/RET (PTC1) oncogene [58]. We were interested in determining whether the spatial proximity is a contributing factor also in the generation of the thyroid-specific TRK oncogenes.

The distance between NTRK1 and its oncogenic partner TPR was determined by two-color FISH and two-dimensional microscopy on nuclei from normal thyrocytes and peripheral blood lymphocytes. To exclude possible artefacts of bi-dimensional analysis, we performed a three-dimensional reconstruction of the data by applying a mathematical correction considering the maximized error derived from the nuclei thickness. As reported in Fig. 3, the distance between NTRK1 and TPR loci in thyrocytes is reduced with respect to PBL. This proximity may favor thyroid specific oncogenic rearrangements, which may represent the consequence of DNA double strand breaks repair [59].

## 6. Conclusions

Rearrangements of RET and NTRK1 are frequently detected in human papillary thyroid

carcinoma. TRK oncogenes involve different activating genes containing coiled-coil domains that mediate protein dimerization and consequent tyrosine kinase activation. Studies on TFG, involved in the generation of TRK-T3, have demonstrated an important role of regions outside the coiled-coil domain in oncogenic activation, and this could be related to interaction with other proteins. The high proneness of thyroid epithelium to chromosomal rearrangements might reflect structural and enzymatic properties of thyrocytes with respect to DNA repair. We provided evidences that loci proximity of rearranging loci in interphase thyroid nuclei may favor the generation of TRK oncogenes.
