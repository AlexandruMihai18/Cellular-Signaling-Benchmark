## Summary

Periplasmic membrane fusion proteins (MFPs) are essential components of the type I protein secretion systems and drug efflux pumps in Gram-negative bacteria. Previous studies suggested that MFPs connect the inner and outer membrane components of the transport systems and by this means co-ordinate the transfer of substrates across the two membranes. In this study, we purified and reconstituted the macrolide transporter MacAB from *Escherichia coli*. Here, MacA is a periplasmic MFP and MacB is an ABC-type transporter. Similar to other MFP-dependent transporters from *E. coli*, the *in vivo* function of MacAB requires the outer membrane channel TolC. The purified MacB displayed a basal ATPase activity in detergent micelles. This activity conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics but was unresponsive to substrates or accessory proteins. Upon reconstitution into proteoliposomes, the ATPase activity of MacB was strictly dependent on MacA. The catalytic efficiency of MacAB ATPase was more than 45-fold higher than the activity of MacB alone. Both the N- and C-terminal regions of MacA were essential for this activity. MacA stimulated MacB ATPase only in phospholipid bilayers and did not need the presence of macrolides. Our results suggest that MacA is a functional subunit of the MacB transporter.

## Introduction

Enfolded into a two-membrane envelope, Gram-negative bacteria need special transport systems to achieve efficient export of diverse substrates. In a simplest arrangement these transport systems are formed through the association of three proteins: the inner membrane (IM) transporter and two accessory proteins located in the periplasm and in the outer membrane (OM) respectively (Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 2000a; Andersen *et al.*, 2001; Eswaran *et al.*, 2004). Studies of several transport systems established that the three components associate with each other *in vivo* and presumably form a protein conduit spanning the two membranes and the periplasmic space (Letoffe *et al.*, 1996; Hwang *et al.*, 1997; Husain *et al.*, 2004; Nehme *et al.*, 2004; Tikhonova and Zgurskaya, 2004; Touze *et al.*, 2004).

The IM transporters can belong to any of the three superfamilies of proteins: the major facilitator, the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) or the resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND). In contrast, the accessory proteins are conserved among various transport systems. The OM components comprise the outer membrane factor family of proteins (Paulsen *et al.*, 1997). These proteins are believed to form channels in the OM and by this means facilitate the transport of substrates across the OM (Andersen *et al.*, 2001). The periplasmic accessory proteins are members of the membrane fusion protein (MFP) family (Dinh *et al.*, 1994).

The proposed role of MFPs is to provide a physical link between IM and OM components of the complexes. This role is supported by the finding that MFPs can be cross-linked *in vivo* to both components and that in the absence of one of the components MFPs still can be co-purified with either the corresponding IM transporter or the OM channel (Hwang *et al.*, 1997; Thanabalu *et al.*, 1998; Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 2000b; Husain *et al.*, 2004; Tikhonova and Zgurskaya, 2004; Touze *et al.*, 2004). The function of MFPs in the transport process is indispensable because mutational inactivation of these proteins leads to a total loss of transport activity (Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 2000a). However, how these proteins function in the context of two membranes remains unclear.

To investigate the role of MFPs in transport across two membranes we purified and reconstituted *in vitro* the macrolide transporter MacAB from *Escherichia coli*. In this complex, MacA is a typical periplasmic MFP and MacB is an ABC-type transporter (Kobayashi *et al.*, 2001). Previous studies established that along with the nucleotide-

binding domain (NBD) atypically located on the N-terminus, MacB contains only four transmembrane segments (TMS) and a large periplasmic loop between TMS1 and TMS2 (Kobayashi *et al.*, 2003). In contrast, other ABC transporters contain at least six TMS and function as dimers with the total 12 TMS (Holland and Blight, 1999). The unique transmembrane topology established MacB as a member of the new Macrolide Exporter Family within the ABC superfamily of proteins.

Although ABC transporters are the major single- and multidrug efflux transporters in eukaryotes, only a few ABC single-drug exporters for macrolides and daunomycin were characterized in Gram-positive bacteria (Holland and Blight, 1999; Poelarends *et al.*, 2002). MacB is the first case of an ABC drug transporter experimentally established in a Gram-negative bacterium. Similar to other ABC exporters from Gram-negative bacteria such as the type I secretion transporters HlyB and PtrB, MacB operates in the association with the periplasmic accessory protein MacA (Kobayashi *et al.*, 2001).

In *E. coli*, the major transporter responsible for the high levels of resistance to macrolides is the multidrug efflux complex AcrAB-TolC (Nikaido and Zgurskaya, 2001). Cells deficient in AcrAB are highly susceptible to macrolides suggesting that either the *macAB* operon is silent under normal laboratory conditions or that the MacAB transporter is ineffective in protection against macrolides. Only the overproduction of MacAB in the ΔacrAB strain leads to a moderate (four- to eightfold) increase in resistance to 14- and 15-membered macrolides but no or weak resistance against 16-membered ones. Both MacA and MacB are required to achieve this resistance. In addition, the lack of the universal OM channel TolC completely abolished the MacAB-mediated macrolide resistance suggesting that MacAB functions in the association with TolC (Kobayashi *et al.*, 2001). These results suggested that MacAB-TolC is the first ATP-driven three-component complex involved in the transport of small molecules across two membranes of *E. coli*.

Driven by hydrolysis of ATP, MacAB-TolC transport complex is an attractive model to study how all three components assemble into a functional complex and how each of the components contributes to the substrate translocation across two membranes. In this study, we purified and reconstituted MacA and MacB proteins into proteoliposomes and characterized the ATPase activity of MacB transporter alone and in the association with MacA. We found that MacA, the MFP subunit of the complex, stimulates the ATPase activity of MacB transporter. This result suggests that in addition to the structural role of a linker between the IM and OM, MFPs play an active functional role in the transport across two membranes.


Results

**Expression and purification of MacA and MacB**

Genes encoding MacA and MacB were cloned separately or as a single operon into expression vectors (Table 1). To facilitate purification, six-histidine tags were added to the C termini of MacA and MacB. The overproduced MacA and MacB were recovered from the membrane fractions of corresponding *E. coli* cells by solubilization with Triton X-100 (TX). After purification, MacA was detected on polyacrylamide (SDS-PA) gels as the major band with an apparent molecular weight (MW) 48 kDa (Fig. 1A). In addition, a 38 kDa protein was consistently co-purified with MacA. This protein was identified by the N-terminal sequencing as the major porin of *E. coli* OmpF.

Immunoblotting analysis of MacA preparation with anti-MacB antibodies showed that no chromosomally encoded MacB was co-purified with MacA. However, small amounts of TolC were immunodetected with anti-TolC antibody (data not shown). Neither contaminating TolC nor OmpF/C had any effect on ATPase rates of MacB and MacAB because MacA purified from either OmpF/C or TolC null mutants stimulated ATP hydrolysis by MacB with the same efficiency as MacA purified from the wild-type cells (data not shown).

Previous studies (Kobayashi *et al.*, 2001) and sequence analyses suggested that MacA could be a peripheral membrane protein located in the periplasm (signal peptide probability of 0.752 according to SignalP 3.0). During purification, however, MacA remained tightly associated with membranes. Furthermore, only trace amounts of MacA could be released from the membranes by treatment with 4.5 M urea (data not shown). To investigate whether the putative signal peptide of MacA is cleaved, we determined the N-terminal amino acid sequences of the purified MacA-6His and the unmodified, native MacA expressed from the pUMacAB plasmid. Both proteins contained the same MKKRKTVKKR amino acid sequence, which is 100% identical to the N-terminal sequence of the unprocessed MacA. Thus, the overproduced MacA does not undergo the N-terminal processing and contains a single N-terminal TMS.

In all tested WT cells the expression of the chromosomal MacA was at or below the level of sensitivity of our anti-MacA antibody (data not shown). For unknown reasons the expression of MacA was higher in HZ102 (Table 1). Therefore, HZ102 cells were used to compare apparent molecular masses of the plasmid- and chromosomally encoded MacA (Fig. 1B). As judged by mobility in SDS-PAGE, the apparent molecular mass of the chromosomally encoded MacA was identical to that of the plasmid-produced MacA (Fig. 1B). These results suggest that both the chromosomal and the plasmid-encoded MacA contain a single N-terminal TMS.

The purified MacB was visualized on gels as two major bands with apparent MWs 70 kDa and 140 kDa respectively (Fig. 1A). Both bands reacted with the HisProbe (Pierce) suggesting that these two bands could correspond to the monomeric and dimeric MacB (data not shown). The N-terminal sequencing confirmed that the 140 kDa band contains MacB. Surprisingly, this band was resistant to boiling in the presence of reducing agents suggesting that these possible MacB dimers are stabilized by non-disulphide covalent bonds. Immunoblotting analysis with anti-MacA and anti-TolC antibodies showed that neither chromosomally encoded MacA nor TolC are co-purified with MacB (data not shown).

Reconstitution of MacA, MacB and MacAB into proteoliposomes

To investigate a functional relationship between MacA and MacB, we reconstituted MacA and MacB separately or both proteins together into proteoliposomes (Fig. 2A). The orientation of proteins after reconstitution was assessed by proteolysis. About 50% of the reconstituted MacA was accessible to the cleavage by trypsin (Fig. 2B). In contrast, when proteoliposomes were solubilized with TX all MacA was digested with trypsin. We conclude that after reconstitution, about half of MacA molecules are exposed in detergent (Fig. 1D). The activity remained the same in the broad range (0–300 mM) of KCl concentrations and at pH in the range between 6.0 and 8.0 (data not shown).

Purified MacB is functionally active

When assayed in TX solution, the purified MacB displayed a basal ATPase-specific activity of 1.5 ± 0.4 mol ATP min⁻¹ mol⁻¹ of protein ((Table 2, Fig. 1C). The MacB ATPase conformed to the Michaelis-Menten kinetics with *K*<sub>M</sub> = 0.91 ± 0.19 mM and *k*<sub>cat</sub> = 0.17 ± 0.03 s⁻¹ (Table 2, Fig. 1C). The MacB activity was unresponsive to oleandomycin, the putative substrate of MacB (data not shown). Similarly, the presence of accessory proteins MacA, TolC or both did not substantially affect ATP hydrolysis by MacB

on the outer surface of proteoliposomes. The proteolytic profile of MacA reconstituted into proteoliposomes and solubilized from the proteoliposomes with TX were identical. This result suggested that the conformations of MacA in proteoliposomes and in detergent are similar.

MacB reconstituted into proteoliposomes was also accessible to trypsin (Fig. 2C). However, the proteolytic profile of MacB in proteoliposomes differed from that of MacB solubilized by TX. This result suggested either that phospholipids protect the MacB sites vulnerable to trypsin or that MacB assumes a different conformation upon

reconstitution into proteoliposomes. The orientation of the NBDs of MacB was investigated using the ATP hydrolysis assay. We estimate that about 30–40% of MacB reconstituted in the presence or absence of MacA is inserted into bilayers with the NBDs facing outward (Fig. 3A).

MacA is required for the ATP hydrolysis by the reconstituted MacB

After reconstitution into proteoliposomes, the basal ATPase activity of MacB decreased about 10-fold to

0.1 ± 0.03 mol ATP min⁻¹ mol⁻¹ of protein (Fig. 3A). The Kₘ for ATP increased about 2.5-fold to 2.3 ± 0.6 mM and the kₐt decreased to 0.10 ± 0.03 s⁻¹ (Table 2, Fig. 3B). This result suggested that MacB ATPase is inhibited upon incorporation into phospholipid bilayer. However, when both MacB and MacA were pre-mixed together prior to reconstitution, the obtained MacAB proteoliposomes efficiently hydrolysed ATP (Fig. 3A and Table 2). Kinetic experiments showed that MacA lowers the Kₘ of MacB ATPase by about sixfold to 0.38 ± 0.11 mM and increases the turnover number by about eightfold to 0.78 ± 0.15 s⁻¹ (Table 2, Fig. 3B). As a result, the kₐt/Kₘ of MacB ATPase in MacAB proteoliposomes is more than 10-fold higher than that of MacB in detergent micelles, and more than 45-fold higher than the kₐt/Kₘ of MacB reconstituted into proteoliposomes alone. No contaminating ATPase activity was detected in proteoliposomes containing MacA alone (Fig. 3B). Oleandomycin did not stimulate the MacAB-dependent hydrolysis of ATP. The ATPase activity of MacAB was inhibited by o-vanadate with the apparent IC₅₀ ~0.3 mM. However, 10 mM sodium azide did not affect MacAB (data not shown).

MacA stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by MacB was concentration dependent (Fig. 3D). The half-maximum stimulation seems to be achieved when MacB : MacA molar ratio was about 2:3. Further increase in MacA concentration was not accompanied by an increase in the rate of ATP hydrolysis. The opposite would be expected if the increase in the ATPase rate was due to the presence of a contaminating membrane protein.

The specificity of the ATPase stimulation was further confirmed by constructing MacB K47L and D169N mutants containing substitutions in the conserved catalytic residues of Walker A and B motifs respectively (Frelet and Klein, 2006). The expression of these mutants in the multidrug susceptible E. coli AG100AX (ΔacrAB ΔacrEF)

A. MacA and MacB reconstituted into separate proteoliposomes were assayed for ATP hydrolysis before (bar 2) and after (bar 3) the intermixing of bilayers was induced by sonication. All reactions contained 0.4 μM MacB and 0.1 mM Mg-ATP. MacA was added to 1.0 μM final concentration.

did not lead to elevated resistance to macrolides, hence both mutants are non-functional (data not shown). In detergent micelles, the rate of ATP hydrolysis by purified K47L and D169N mutants was 40–60-fold lower than the activity of the wild-type MacB. Furthermore, in proteoliposomes, the ATPase activity of mutants was not restored by MacA (Fig. 3A). Thus, the MacA-dependent stimulation of the ATPase activity is specific to MacB.

MacA shares 23% identity and 44% similarity with AcrA, the MFP component of the multidrug efflux complex AcrAB-TolC. Furthermore, similar to MacA, the periplasmic AcrA is suggested to establish the interaction with TolC. To investigate the specificity of MacB stimulation by MacA, we reconstituted MacB in the presence of AcrA (Fig. 3C). When present during reconstitution, AcrA increased the rate of MacB-dependent ATP hydrolysis by only 1.8-fold (Fig. 3D). For comparison, in the presence of MacA the rate of ATP hydrolysis by MacB increased up to 100-fold (Fig. 3A). We conclude that the specific interaction with MacA is required for the efficient ATP hydrolysis by MacB.

MacA rescues MacB ATPase from the inhibitory action of lipids

To investigate how MacA contributes to ATP hydrolysis by MacB, we prepared proteoliposomes containing MacA or MacB alone. Then the mixture of two proteoliposome species was either sonicated to induce intermixing of phospholipid bilayers prior to the ATP hydrolysis assay or tested in the assay without sonication, so that MacA and MacB remained in two different bilayers. When sonication was omitted, MacA proteoliposomes present in the reaction mixture did not stimulate MacB ATPase activity (Fig. 4A, bar 2). However, when two types of proteoliposomes were mixed together and then sonicated prior to the assay, MacA strongly stimulated MacB activity (Fig. 4A, bar 3). After sonication with MacA proteoliposomes the ATPase activity of the reconstituted MacB increased by 25-fold to 3.4 mol ATP min⁻¹ mol⁻¹ of MacB. This activity, however, was somewhat lower than the activity of the co-reconstituted MacA and MacB (Fig. 4A, bar 4). The MacA-dependent stimulation was achieved only after sonication demonstrating that to stimulate ATP hydrolysis MacA should be located in the same phospholipid bilayer as MacB. This result also shows that the low basal ATPase activity of MacB alone is not caused by the non-specific inactivation (for example, due to aggregation) of MacB during reconstitution. Even in the absence of MacA, MacB is reconstituted into proteoliposomes in its functionally active state, but its activity is inhibited by lipids.

To investigate how ATP hydrolysis by MacB is affected by lipids, increasing amounts of *E. coli* phospholipids were added to MacB in TX micelles (Fig. 4B). Surprisingly, even when present at the 5.7:1 detergent-to-lipid (TX/lipid) ratio, lipids strongly (up to 10-fold) inhibited the ATPase activity of MacB. Furthermore, at high TX/lipid ratios the presence of MacA did not protect MacB from this inhibition. However, at the TX/lipid ratios at or below 2.8 MacA strongly stimulated MacB ATPase. The maximal stimulation of MacB by MacA (about 50-fold) was found at the TX/lipid ratio ~1. Previous studies showed that complete solubilization of lipids is achieved at TX/lipid molar ratios above 5.17 (Lopez et al., 1998). Both mixed micelles and vesicles are present in TX-lipid mixture at the TX/lipid ratio below 2.7 and mixed vesicles predominate at ratios around 1. Even when completely solubilized in mixed micelles (TX/lipid ratio 5.7), lipids inhibit MacB ATPase. The stimulating effect of MacA can be seen at TX/lipid ratios coinciding with the appearance of lipid

vesicles. Thus, ATP hydrolysis by MacB is stimulated by MacA only when both proteins are inserted into phospholipid bilayers.

MacA is needed for ATP hydrolysis by MacB in E. coli membrane vesicles

We next investigated if the MacA-dependent stimulation of MacB takes place in the membrane of E. coli Multidrug-susceptible AG100AX (ΔacrAB ΔacrEF) cells were transformed with pUC18 vector or plasmids express-

ing MacB alone or together with MacA. As seen in Fig. 5A, MacA constituted about 20% of total membrane protein in the membrane vesicles prepared from cells overproducing MacAB. MacB could be clearly detected in membrane vesicles prepared from MacAB and MacB overproducing cells but not in vesicles prepared from the cells carrying pUC18 (Fig. 5A). However, in both preparations the amounts of MacB were similar and constituted less than 1% of total membrane protein.

activities (Fig. 5B). Preliminary experiments showed that sodium azide does not inhibit the purified MacAB ATPase (data not shown). However, o-vanadate was found to be the effective inhibitor of MacAB. Therefore, isolated vesicles were next treated with sodium azide or combination of both inhibitors. The azide-sensitive ATPase activity accounted for ~45% of the total activity of the MacAB-containing membranes (Fig. 5B). In contrast, about 70–80% of the total ATPase activities of MacB-containing membranes and pUC18 membranes were inhibited by azide. Oleandomycin (0.01–0.2 mM) did not affect the azide-resistant ATPases in all tested vesicles (Fig. 5B). Thus, vesicles isolated from MacAB-overproducing cells contain elevated levels of the azide-resistant ATPase. The remaining, azide-resistant activity of MacAB-containing vesicles was highly sensitive to o-vanadate (Fig. 5C). About 75% of this activity was inhibited by 0.1 mM o-vanadate. In contrast, MacB-vesicles and pUC18-vesicles were only mildly affected by this inhibitor. At 0.5 mM o-vanadate all three type of vesicles contained similar ATPase activities. Thus, the membrane vesicles isolated from the cells overproducing MacAB contain the elevated, vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity. This activity was not found in membrane vesicles isolated from cells overproducing MacB alone or carrying pUC18. Thus, the presence of MacAB increases the basal ATPase activity of *E. coli* membranes. In agreement with our biochemical data, this basal ATP hydrolysis is elevated only when both MacA and MacB are present in membranes.

Both N- and C-terminal domains of MacA are required for its function in vitro and in vivo

The finding that MacA stimulates MacB only in phospholipid bilayers suggested that the interaction between the N-terminal TMS of MacA and MacB could be responsible for the change in the ATPase activity. To investigate this possibility, we replaced the N-terminal TMS of MacA with the cleavable signal peptide of the outer membrane protein OmpA (MacAΔN).

MacAΔN was purified from the soluble protein fraction (Fig. 6A). Hence, the majority of the overproduced MacAΔN was cleaved and released into the periplasm. The purified MacAΔN was pre-incubated with MacB in detergent micelles and then reconstitution into proteoliposomes was carried out as before. As shown in Fig. 6B (insert), after reconstitution, MacAΔN was co-purified with proteoliposomes suggesting that this soluble protein is either trapped inside of proteoliposomes or bound by MacB (see below). In the alternative approach, increasing amounts of MacAΔN were added to the pre-formed MacB proteoliposomes and then mixture was sonicated to ensure that MacAΔN is present on both sides of proteoliposomes. Under all tested conditions, MacAΔN

did not stimulate the ATPase activity of MacB (Fig. 6B and data not shown). Thus, the N-terminal TMS is required for the activity of MacA *in vitro*.

We next constructed a MacA mutant lacking 90 C-terminal amino acid residues (MacAΔ90). We reasoned that if the N-terminal TMS of MacA is solely responsible for the change in ATP hydrolysis, the C-terminal deletion mutant containing the intact N-terminal TMS will be fully functional. The overproduced MacAΔ90 was tightly associated with membranes and was purified using detergents (Fig. 6A). As MacAΔ90 contains a single N-terminal TMS, this protein was readily incorporated into MacB-proteoliposomes (Fig. 6B, insert). Nevertheless, MacAΔ90 did not stimulate the ATPase activity of MacB (Fig. 6B). Thus, both the N- and C-termini of MacA are essential for the activity of MacA *in vitro*.

We also constructed C-terminal deletion mutants of MacA lacking 12, 19, 47, 67 and 80 C-terminal amino acid residues. All constructed deletion mutants were readily expressed in *E. coli* but were insoluble in non-ionic detergents and presumably formed inclusion bodies (data not shown).

As modifications of the N- and C-termini could possibly lead to MacA misfolding, we next compared proteolytic profiles of the purified MacA, MacAΔN and MacAΔ90. Overall the proteolytic profiles of MacA and MacAΔN are very similar. Both proteins are first cleaved into two fragments with the apparent MWs 33 and 17 kDa (Fig. 6C, bands 1 and 2). Tryptic fragments of MacAΔN were slightly smaller than those of MacA. As the difference in the MWs of these two proteins arises due to the lack of the N-terminal TMS in MacAΔN, the 33 kDa tryptic fragment is probably the C-terminally truncated protein. The size of this fragment is similar to the size of the C-terminally truncated MacAΔ90. In accord, MacAΔ90 is noticeably more resistant to trypsin. At higher concentrations of trypsin MacAΔ90 is cleaved with the appearance of 17 kDa fragment (band 3), which is similar to the band 2 in MacA. We conclude that the structure of the core of MacA was not affected by deletions (Fig. 6C).

To determine whether the N- and C-terminal domains of MacA are essential for its macrolide transport function *in vivo*, MacAΔN and MacAΔ90 were cloned into a single operon with MacB (in Table 1, pUA<sub>ΔNB</sub><sup>His</sup> and pUA<sub>Δ90B</sub> respectively) and expressed in multidrug-susceptible AG100AX (ΔacrAB ΔacrEF) cells. Immunoblotting analysis showed that both constructs produced MacB in amounts similar to the wild type (Fig. 6D, top panel). The amounts of MacAΔ90 produced from pUA<sub>Δ90B</sub> were significantly lower than the amounts of MacA and MacAΔN (Fig. 6D, bottom panel) suggesting that deletions in the C-terminal domain of MacA lead to protein instability.

Consistent with previous studies (Kobayashi *et al.*, 2001), we found that the overproduction of the wild-type

Fig. 6. N- and C-terminal domains of MacA are essential for the MacA-dependent stimulation of MacB ATPase.

B. The ATPase activity of MacB proteoliposomes alone (bar 1) and MacB co-reconstituted with MacA (bar 2), MacAΔN (bar 3) and MacAΔ90 (bar 4). Reactions contained 0.3 μM MacB and either 0.8 μM MacA, or 1.0 μM MacAΔN, or 0.7 μM MacAΔ90. The ATPase activity was measured at a Mg-ATP concentration of 0.1 mM. Error bars are SDs (*n* = 3).

C. Partial proteolysis of MacA, MacAΔN and MacAΔ90 with increasing concentrations of trypsin as analysed by 12% SDS-PAGE. The MWs of MacA, MacAΔN and MacAΔ90 calculated from the amino acid compositions (plus 6His tag) are 41.4, 38.8 and 31.7 kDa respectively. In the MacA sample, asterisks mark OmpF (top band) and a degradation product.

D. Anti-MacB and anti-MacA immunoblotting analysis of AG100AX cells carrying pUMacAB, pUAΔ90B, pUAΔNBHIS (13.5 μg of total cell protein per lane). Asterisks mark the MacA degradation products.

MacA and MacB in AG100AX cells provided four- to 16-fold increase in minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of erythromycin and oleandomycin (Table 3). The inactivation of the chromosomal *macAB* slightly increased the *E. coli* susceptibility to these antibiotics. In contrast, when MacB was paired with either MacAΔN or MacAΔ90, no elevated resistance to erythromycin and oleandomycin was observed (Table 3). Thus, both the N- and C-terminal regions of MacA are essential not only for the stimulation of the MacB ATPase activity *in vitro* but also for the function of this protein *in vivo*. This result suggests that the MacA-dependent stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by MacB is functionally linked to macrolide resistance *in vivo*.

MacAΔN interacts with MacB

The loss of interaction with MacB could be one possible reason why MacAΔN and MacAΔ90 did not complement the function of the wild-type MacA *in vivo* and did not stimulate MacB ATPase *in vitro*. When MacA, MacAΔN and MacAΔ90 without tags were cloned and expressed in a single operon with the 6His-tagged MacB, MacA and MacAΔN proteins were reproducibly co-purified with the tagged MacB on the Cu²⁺-affinity column (Fig. 7A, bottom panel). This result suggested that both proteins are able to bind MacB. In contrast, only traces of MacAΔ90 were present in MacB-containing fractions

suggesting that this mutant is defective in interactions with MacB.

To confirm that MacAΔN binds MacB, purified MacAΔN was incubated with either liposomes or MacB-containing proteoliposomes and then the mixture was analysed by flotation in a sucrose step gradient (Fig. 7B). Under the selected conditions, the soluble MacAΔN did not bind to liposomes and remained on the bottom of the sucrose gradient (Fig. 7B, top panel). As expected, the MacB proteoliposomes floated to the top of 20% sucrose (Fig. 7B, middle panel). However, when MacAΔN was pre-incubated with MacB-containing proteoliposomes about 30% of MacAΔN co-floated with MacB proteoliposomes (Fig. 7B, bottom panel).

The MacAΔN–MacB interactions were further verified by chemical cross-linking. MacAΔN alone or in the presence of MacB was treated with increasing concentrations of amine-reactive cross-linker disuccinimidyl suberate (DSS, Pierce). MacAΔN oligomers and intramolecular cross-links were detected at 0.05 mM DSS (Fig. 7C, left panel). In the presence of MacB, higher molecular complexes containing MacAΔN and presumably MacB appeared at the same concentrations of DSS (Fig. 7C, right panel).

Thus, the soluble periplasmic protein MacAΔN binds MacB. Yet this interaction does not yield the functional macrolide transporter. Deletions in the C-terminal domain of MacA appear to compromise the ability of the protein to interact with MacB. Taken together, these data show that the periplasmic domain of MacA is sufficient to bind MacB, whereas the transmembrane interaction is required for macrolide resistance *in vivo* and for ATP hydrolysis *in vitro*.

### Discussion

Membrane fusion proteins are well recognized as structural components of multiprotein transporters from Gram-negative bacteria (Dinh *et al.*, 1994). Located in the periplasm, MFPs establish interactions between proteins located in two different membranes: the IM transporters and the OM channels. Here, we show that during transport of diverse substrates across two membranes in addition to serving as linkers MFPs can play an active functional role. Upon reconstitution into proteoliposomes, the purified MacB transporter strictly relied on its periplasmic counterpart MacA to efficiently hydrolyse ATP. MacA is the first member of the MFP family of proteins that was found to stimulate the ATPase activity of the corresponding ABC transporter.

Similar to other well-characterized ABC transporters, such as the bacterial maltose uptake protein complex MalFGK2 or human multidrug transporter P-glycoprotein (Nikaido, 1994; Shapiro and Ling, 1994; Ramachandra *et al.*, 1998; Reich-Slotky *et al.*, 2000), MacB displayed a basal ATPase activity in detergent micelles (Fig. 1). The MacB ATPase conformed to Michaelis-Menten kinetics with *K*<sub>M</sub> for ATP in the micromolar range. This spontaneous MacB-dependent ATP hydrolysis in detergent was not significantly stimulated by its accessory proteins MacA and TolC as well as by the putative substrate oleandomycin.

The basal ATPase activity of MacB in detergents was inhibited by lipids at all tested detergent/lipid ratios (Fig. 4B) suggesting that binding of lipids and not the formation of lipid bilayer leads to conformational change in the protein. This inhibition by lipids is not typical for ABC-type transporters. In fact, the opposite is usually true – reconstitution into liposomes, for example, stimulated the ATPase activity of such ABC transporters as PrtD, Atn1p, P-glycoprotein and others (Delepelaire, 1998; Modok *et al.*, 2004; Kuhnke *et al.*, 2006).

Surprisingly, the MacB ATPase activity was recovered and significantly increased in the presence of MacA. The catalytic efficiency of MacAB ATPase, *k*<sub>cat</sub>/*K*<sub>M</sub>, was more than 45-fold higher than the activity of MacB reconstituted alone and more than 10-fold higher than the MacB activity in detergent micelles (Table 2). Several lines of evidence argue that the effect of MacA is specific. First, the MacA-dependent stimulation occurred only in liposomes suggesting that a specific complex between MacA and MacB is formed only under physiologically relevant conditions.

in phospholipid bilayers (Figs 3A and 4B). Second, no stimulation was found when ATP hydrolysis was assayed in the mixture of MacA and MacB reconstituted into separate proteoliposomes (Fig. 4A). However, intermixing of MacA- and MacB-containing proteoliposomes by sonication resulted in the increase of the rate of ATP hydrolysis. Third, MacA stimulated MacB in a saturable manner (Fig. 3D) with the apparent half-maximum stimulation achieved at the MacA : MacB molar ratio 3:2. Fourth,

ATP hydrolysis was abolished when MacA was co-reconstituted with MacB K47L and D169N containing mutations in catalytic residues of the NBD. Finally, AcrA, the structural homologue of MacA, could not substitute MacA in ATP hydrolysis (Fig. 3D). MacA-dependent stimulation of ATP hydrolysis by MacB also occurs in E. coli membranes. The inverted vesicles isolated from the cells overproducing both MacA and MacB, but not from the cells overproducing MacB alone, contained

elevated, o-vanadate-sensitive ATPase activity (Fig. 5). We conclude that MacA is specifically required for the ATPase activity of MacB.

Previously, Kobayashi *et al.* suggested that MacA contains a cleavable N-terminal signal peptide. In contrast, our results show that MacA does not undergo processing and contains a single N-terminal TMS (Fig. 1B). Thus, similar to other MFPs associated with ABC-type transporters, MacA makes a contact with the cytoplasmic NBD and transmembrane domains of MacB. The periplasmic domain of MacA, MacAΔN, is sufficient to bind MacB (Fig. 7). Yet the transmembrane interaction is required for macrolide resistance in vivo and for ATP hydrolysis in vitro.

High resolution structures of two MFPs, MexA and AcrA, are currently available (Akama *et al.*, 2004; Higgins *et al.*, 2004; Mikolosko *et al.*, 2006). The central structural feature of both proteins is an α-helical hairpin that brings N- and C-termini of proteins into a contact. Consistent with such arrangement is our finding that the N-terminal TMS of MacA is required but not sufficient to stimulate MacB ATPase. The MacA variant lacking the C-terminal domain also lost its ability to confer resistance to macrolides in vivo and to stimulate ATPase activity of MacB in vitro. Furthermore, MacAΔ90 appears to be defective in binding to MacB. Previously, the C-terminal domain of AcrA, the MacA homologue, was also shown to be important for interactions with two other cognate components of the complex (Touze *et al.*, 2004).

Although TolC is required for macrolide transport in vivo, the purified reconstituted TolC did not modulate the ATPase activities of MacB or MacAB complex (data not shown). Similarly, RND-type transporters that require TolC in vivo were functionally active in vitro in the absence of TolC (Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 1999a; Aires and Nikaido, 2005). How TolC contributes to the transport reaction remains unclear. Interestingly, the MFP-dependent transporters, including MacAB homologues, are broadly represented not only in Gram-negative but also in Gram-positive bacteria (Harley *et al.*, 2000). Gram-positive bacteria lack the OM and these transporters are fully functional without TolC.

The stimulating effect of MacA is reminiscent of periplasmic ligand-binding proteins. These proteins specifically associate with ABC transporters involved in uptake of diverse nutrients in Gram-negative bacteria. Examples include the extensively studied maltose-binding (the product of *malE* gene) and histidine-binding (HisJ) proteins (Nikaido and Hall, 1998). The ligand-binding proteins strongly stimulate ATPase activities of the corresponding transporters. However, these proteins are also responsible for the high-affinity binding of substrates and stimulate ATP hydrolysis by ABC transporters in the substrate-bound state (Davidson *et al.*, 1992; Liu *et al.*, 1999). The MacA activity was independent from macrolides, the putative substrates of MacAB. Oleandomycin did not stimulate ATPase activity of MacAB neither in membrane vesicles isolated from *E. coli* nor in the reconstituted proteoliposomes. Further studies will be required to clarify the role of substrates in MacA activity. Curiously, recent studies showed that deletion of the *macAB* genes attenuates *Salmonella* virulence (Nishino *et al.*, 2006). In *Bacillus subtilis* the *macAB* homologue encoded by *yknXYZ* operon provides resistance from the endogenously produced antimicrobial peptide SdpC (Butcher and Helmann, 2006). These findings demonstrate that the MacAB function might be unrelated to efflux of macrolides.

Membrane fusion proteins associate with structurally and mechanistically diverse transporters. It is presently unclear whether all MFPs are able to stimulate activities of their respective transporters. At least one more MFP was reported to have such ability: AcrA was shown to stimulate the fluorescent lipid transport activity of its cognate RND-type transporter AcrB (Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 1999a). However, at that time the effect of AcrA was primarily attributed to the ability of AcrA to cause adhesion between two phospholipid bilayers. More recently, AcrA was found to be required for the substrate-dependent proton efflux and aminoglycoside transport activities of another RND-type transporter AcrD (Aires and Nikaido, 2005). It is tempting to speculate that during transport across two membranes all MFPs are actively involved in the transport process and operate by the same mechanism.

## Experimental procedures

### Strains and plasmids

*Escherichia coli* strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. The chromosomal *macAB* region of *E. coli* K12 was amplified using PCR and cloned into KpnI or PstI restriction sites of pUC18 vector to yield the pUMacAB plasmid.

To produce MacA, MacB and MacAB under the IPTG-inducible T7 promoter, the corresponding DNA sequences were amplified by PCR from the chromosome of *E. coli* K12 and cloned into Ncol and Xhol restriction sites of pET21d(+) to obtain pETA<sup>His</sup>, pETB<sup>His</sup> and pETAB<sup>His</sup>. Upon transformation into BL21(DE3), these plasmids expressed MacA<sup>His</sup>, MacB<sup>His</sup> and MacAB<sup>His</sup> as detected by immunoblotting with HisProbe-HRP (Pierce). However, the expression of MacB<sup>His</sup> and MacAB<sup>His</sup> from pETB<sup>His</sup> and pETAB<sup>His</sup>, respectively, was low and inconsistent (data not shown). For the expression under the arabinose-inducible promoter, plasmids pETA<sup>His</sup>, pETB<sup>His</sup> and pETAB<sup>His</sup> were cleaved with BlpI enzyme and treated with T4 DNA polymerase to produce blunt ends. Next, plasmids were treated with Ncol, DNA fragments corresponding to MacA, MacB and MacAB were recovered from agarose gels and cloned into pBAD vector digested with Ncol and SnaBI restriction endonucleases to obtain pBA<sup>His</sup>, pBB<sup>His</sup> and pBAB<sup>His</sup> plasmids.

Plasmids producing MacBK47L, MacBD169N and MacAΔ90 were constructed by PCR using corresponding
plasmids as templates (Table 1). To construct MacAΔN fusion protein, the DNA fragment encoding P32-Q371 of MacA was amplified by PCR using pUMacAB as a template and primers encoding Mscl and Xhol restriction sites. The PCR product was cloned into pUZ11 (Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 1999b) treated with Mscl and Xhol to replace *acrA* sequence. The resulting plasmid pUA${}_{\Delta N}^{\text{His}}$ produced the MacAΔN fusion protein containing M1-K24 amino acid residues of the OmpA signal peptide followed by D26-G34 amino acid residues of AcrA, P32-Q371 amino acid residues of MacA and six C-terminal histidine residues. After translocation, MacAΔN predicted to be cleaved at A22 of the OmpA signal peptide releasing the soluble 38.8 kDa fragment of MacA-6His into periplasm. The pUA${}_{\Delta N}^{\text{BHis}}$ plasmid expressing MacAΔN and MacB-6His was constructed in a similar manner. However, the cloned PCR product contained *macA* and *macB* genes in the chromosomal arrangement starting from P32 of MacA and ending at E648 of MacB.

During solubilization and purification (see below) both MacA and MacB proteins expressed under P${}_{BAD}$ promoter in various *E. coli* strains were cleaved by OmpT protease. Therefore, we constructed several *ompT* null strains (Table 1). For this purpose we used the Red system (Datsenko and Wanner, 2000). The *macAB* null mutant HZ101 was constructed in the same manner. The inactivation of OmpT in the OmpF/C null mutant HN705 did not prevent the cleavage of MacA presumably due to the elevated activity of OmpP protease in this F${}^{+}$ strain of *E. coli* (Matsuo *et al.*, 1999).

### Media and growth conditions

Bacterial cultures were grown at 37°C or 30°C (when required) in Luria–Bertani (LB) broth or LB agar (10 g of Bacto-tryptone, 5 g of yeast extract and 5 g of NaCl per litre). Antibiotics ampicillin (100 μg ml${}^{-1}$), kanamycin (25 μg ml${}^{-1}$), chloramphenicol (25 μg ml${}^{-1}$), tetracycline (25 μg ml${}^{-1}$), spectinomycin (25 μg ml${}^{-1}$) were used for selection where indicated.

### Protein purification

All purified proteins used in this study contained the C-terminal six-histidine tag. The *E. coli* strains and plasmids used in a specific experiment are described in the corresponding figure legends. The expression of proteins was induced by adding IPTG or arabinose to the final concentrations 1 mM and 0.1% respectively. Three hours after induction membrane fractions were isolated as described before (Tikhonova and Zgurskaya, 2004). Purification of TolC and AcrA is described elsewhere (Tikhonova and Zgurskaya, 2004). MacAΔN was purified as described before for AcrA (Zgurskaya and Nikaido, 1999b).

To purify MacA and MacAΔ90, isolated membranes were resuspended in 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole and 1 mM PMSF (buffer A). The equal volume of 10% TX prepared in buffer A was slowly added to membranes and the detergent/membrane suspension was left overnight at 4°C to solubilize membrane proteins. Solubilized membrane proteins were loaded onto Cu${}^{2+}$ charged NTA column (Novagen) equilibrated in buffer A supplemented

with 0.2% TX (Buffer A/TX) and His-tagged proteins were purified using standard procedures. The bulk of MacA was found in a 500 mM imidazole fraction. This fraction was concentrated by dialysis against polyethylene glycol 20 000 in 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% TX (storage buffer) and kept at –20°C in the storage buffer containing 50% glycerol.

Major contaminating proteins in MacA preparations from WT and TolC null strains were identified by the N-terminal sequencing as OmpF and OmpC porins respectively. Previously OmpC was shown to replace the OmpF channel in the OM of *E. coli* in the absence of TolC (Misra and Reeves, 1987). Subsequent attempts to remove OmpF/C from MacA preparations using ion-exchange, hydrophobic or gel filtration chromatography were unsuccessful. Therefore, to test whether porins contribute to MacA activity, protein was also purified from the OmpF/C null mutant. In this preparation, MacA was the only major protein on silver stained gels and was fully functional (data not shown).

Preliminary experiments showed that detergents 0.1% alkyl-β-D-maltoside (DDM) and 1% octyl-β-D-glucoside or high concentrations (above 100 mM) of imidazole irreversibly inactivated the ATPase activity of MacB. The specific activity of MacB purified in 0.1% DDM was 0.035 and 0.004 mol ATP min${}^{-1}$ mol${}^{-1}$ in detergent micelles and proteoliposomes respectively. MacA did not stimulate ATP hydrolysis by the DDM-purified MacB (data not shown). The following protocol was adopted to purify MacB and its K47L and D169N mutants from various *E. coli* strains. Isolated membrane fractions were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl${}_{2}$, 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol (buffer B). Membrane proteins were solubilized with TX in buffer B as described above for MacA and loaded onto a Cu${}^{2+}$-NTA column equilibrated in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0), 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 10% glycerol, 2 mM MgCl${}_{2}$, 0.05 mM β-mercaptoethanol and 0.2% TX (buffer C). The column was washed in a stepwise manner with five column volumes of buffer C supplemented with 5, 20, 40, 100 mM of imidazole. The majority of MacB was eluted in 100 mM imidazole fraction. Purified MacB was concentrated, transferred into a storage buffer [20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.7), 2 mM DTT, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.2% TX, 50% glycerol] and kept at –20°C.

### Protein assays

The N-terminal protein sequencing was carried out at the Molecular Biology Resource Facility at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center.

Protein concentrations were determined using the DC Protein Assay (Bio-Rad) with bovine serum albumin as a standard. To determine amounts of the protein reconstituted into proteoliposomes, proteoliposome samples and bovine serum albumin in increasing concentrations were mixed with the sample buffer, boiled and separated on the same 10% SDS-PAGE. After staining with Coomassie brilliant blue (CBB), gels were scanned on CanoScan D1230U scanner and the peak area for each protein band was quantified using ImageQuant program (Molecular Dynamics). This quantitative SDS-PAGE was also used to estimate protein purity and stoichiometry of proteins in mixtures.

SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting were performed according to standard procedures. Proteins were visualized with anti-MacA, anti-MacB, anti-TolC rabbit polyclonal antibodies and the alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-rabbit antibody (Sigma). Polyclonal anti-MacA and anti-MacB antibody were raised in rabbits using the standard protocol (Covance).

### Reconstitution of proteins into proteoliposomes

Reconstitution was done according to Dong *et al.* (1996) and Jung *et al.* (1998) with minor modifications. *E. coli* polar lipids (Avanti) were resuspended in the reconstitution buffer [20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM DTT] to the final concentration 20 mg ml⁻¹. Liposomes were destabilized with TX in the final concentration 0.45%. The protein sample (25–50 μg) was slowly added to destabilized liposomes and incubated for 30 min at room temperature (RT). TX was removed by incubation for 1 h at RT with SM-2 Adsorbent Bio-Beads (Bio-Rad). Then incubation was repeated two more times with fresh beads for 1 h at RT and 1 h at 4°C. Proteoliposomes were diluted two times with ice cold reconstitution buffer and collected by centrifugation at 250 000 g for 1 h at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 50 μl of buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl and then briefly sonicated. The resulting proteoliposomes were analysed by quantitative SDS-PAGE to determine protein concentration and used for assays within 2–3 days. The final protein : lipid ratio in proteoliposomes was determined by measuring the total phosphate concentration according to Ames (1966). About 20–40% of protein was recovered in proteoliposomes after reconstitution. In all reconstituted proteoliposomes, on average, the molar protein : lipid ratio was approximately 1:50 000. The MacA : MacB molar ratio after reconstitution into proteoliposomes varied between 2:1 and 4:1.

### Sucrose density floatation centrifugation and chemical cross-linking

The purified soluble MacAΔN was pre-incubated with liposomes or MacB proteoliposomes for 30 min at RT. The 50 μl reactions contained 4.1 μM MacAΔN and either 2.5 mM lipids [based on the average MW 785 Da, as calculated from polar lipid composition of exponentially growing *E. coli* at 37°C (Kadner, 1996)], or 0.86 μM of MacB in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 200 mM KCl (buffer A). After incubation, 200 μl of 55% (wt/vol) sucrose in buffer A were added to the reaction mixtures [40% sucrose (wt/vol) final concentration]. The mixture was overlaid with 500 μl of 20% sucrose (wt/vol) in buffer A and subjected to floatation centrifugation for 2 h at 250 000 g at 4°C. Fractions (75 μl) were collected from the top of centrifuge tubes and analysed by SDS-PAGE followed by silver staining.

For chemical cross-linking, MacAΔN was pre-incubated with MacB and lipids [1:300 (wt/wt) MacB : lipid ratio] in buffer containing 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM DTT, 0.45% TX for 15 min at RT. Next, DSS was added at different concentrations and reactions incubated for 30 min at 37°C. Cross-linking was stopped by addition of 10 mM Tris-HCl (final). Samples (50 ng of total protein) were analysed by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotting with anti-MacA antibody. Reactions were also carried out at various MacA : MacB molar ratios (data not shown).

### ATP hydrolysis assay

The rate of ATP hydrolysis by MacB in detergent solution was measured in the reaction mixture containing 0.5–1.4 μM MacB, 20 mM HEPES-KOH (pH 7.0), 5 mM DTT, 50 mM KCl, 0.2% TX, 2 mM MgCl₂ (reaction buffer) at 37°C. The ³²P γ-phosphate labelled ATP (3000 Ci mmol⁻¹, Amersham) was mixed with unlabelled Mg-ATP and added in concentrations indicated in the corresponding figures. One microlitre aliquots was removed at different time points, mixed with 10 μl of the stop buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 20 mM NaEDTA (pH 8.0), 0.5% SDS, 200 mM NaCl, 0.5 mg ml⁻¹ proteinase K] and incubated for 20 min at 50°C. One microlitre of mixture was then spotted on PEI-F cellulose and products of the reaction were separated by thin-layer chromatography in 10% formic acid and 0.5 mM LiCl (Randerath and Randerath, 1967). Amounts of the generated Pi were quantified using Storm Phosphlmager and ImageQuant Software (Molecular Dynamics). Substrates or accessory proteins were prepared in the reaction buffer and added into the reaction mixture after ATP.

ATP hydrolysis in proteoliposomes was measured in the same manner with following modifications. The protein content of freshly reconstituted proteoliposomes was determined by quantitative SDS-PAGE. The final concentration of MacB in all reactions was kept at 0.3–0.4 μM. The MacA concentration was in the range 0.9–1.9 μM with the MacA : MacB molar ratio varied between 2.2 and 4.5 depending on the particular proteoliposome batch. Reactions containing 1–2 μl of proteoliposomes were carried out in the same reaction buffer minus TX (see above) and Mg-ATP was added in concentrations indicated in figure legends. The final volume of reactions was 10 μl. ATP was loaded into proteo-
liposomes by three rounds of freezing in liquid N₂ followed by thawing and brief sonication. After the last round of sonication, samples were immediately placed at 37°C.
