Novel strategies are needed to reduce the obesity epidemic. One promising strategy is activation of brown adipose tissue (BAT), either via the brain or directly, which increases energy expenditure by combustion of fatty acids (FAs) into heat. The enzyme complex AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is crucially involved in energy metabolism and is highly expressed in both brain and BAT, regulating thermogenesis. As a general rule, BAT activity and energy expenditure are increased either by suppression of AMPK activity in the brain, resulting in enhanced sympathetic outflow towards BAT, or by activation of AMPK in BAT. Targeting AMPK may thus hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity and related disorders.

### Increasing energy expenditure to treat obesity

The prevalence of obesity is steadily increasing. Obesity has a great impact on public health as it is associated with disorders such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Reversing obesity is achieved by generating a ‘negative energy balance’. To achieve this, besides strategies focusing on decreasing energy intake, innovative interventions are needed that aim at increasing energy expenditure [1].

BAT is a metabolically active tissue that contributes to energy expenditure by combustion of FAs into heat, a process called thermogenesis. Activation of BAT, for example by cold exposure, increases energy expenditure [2]. Daily cold exposure increases the volume and activity of BAT and induces a reduction in body fat in adult human subjects [3–5]. Interestingly, the metabolic master switch AMPK is activated in BAT on chronic cold exposure [6], suggesting involvement of this enzyme in BAT activity. In addition, several studies suggest that AMPK activity in the brain, specifically within the hypothalamus, regulates BAT activity and energy expenditure via the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) [7–10]. Here we review the role of AMPK in the brain and in BAT, in the physiology of BAT. Furthermore, pharmacological strategies to activate BAT by targeting AMPK and its translation to the human situation are discussed.

#### AMPK as an energy sensor of cells and the body

AMPK is an enzyme complex that mediates the metabolic response to environmental or dietary changes and has a crucial role in both cellular and whole-body energy status. The enzyme complex comprises three subunits: a catalytic α subunit and two regulatory subunits, β and γ [11]. Isoforms of the subunits are differentially expressed across tissues [12]. For instance, of the catalytic α subunit in rodents, the α1 isoform is predominant in the brain and white adipose tissue (WAT) whereas in muscle the α2 isoform is most abundant [13]. In BAT in mice, AMPKα1 is the dominant isoform [6].

AMPK is activated by phosphorylation of the α subunit at Thr172 by liver kinase B1 (LKB1) [14] or Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase β (CaMKKβ) [15–17]. On metabolic stressors such as exercise, fasting, or hypoxia, AMP and ADP levels are high and binding of these factors to phosphorylated AMPK (pAMPK) induces a conformational change that enhances its activity, allowing AMPK to function as an energy sensor. In addition, binding of AMP and ADP to the γ subunit of AMPK inhibits dephosphorylation of Thr172 by protein phosphatases, enlarging the effects on pAMPK activity. The function of the β subunit of AMPK is mainly structural, as it keeps the complex with the α and γ subunits together [11].

Activated AMPK in metabolic organs including the liver, skeletal muscle, and adipose tissue inhibits anabolic processes and stimulates catabolic processes. For example, activated AMPK enhances FA oxidation by phosphorylation of its downstream target acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which directs FAs towards degradation [12,13,18–20]. Complementary information on the cellular function of AMPK in these tissues can be found in **Box 1**.

AMPK activity in peripheral tissues along with AMPK activity in the brain is involved in maintaining whole-body energy balance [21]. While AMPK activity in peripheral organs results from a local energy deficit that may be compensated by enhanced uptake and combustion of nutrients from the circulation, hypothalamic AMPK activity mainly reflects whole-body negative energy balance and is aimed to increase energy levels through modulation of neural outflow to metabolically active organs. For instance, hypothalamic AMPK senses hypoglycaemia and elicits a

**Box 1. AMPK in liver, muscle, and WAT**

**Liver**

AMPK has a role in lipid and glucose metabolism in the liver. Two major downstream targets of AMPK are ACC and HMG-CoA reductase, enzymes involved in the ATP-consuming processes of FA and cholesterol synthesis [18]. ACC catalyses the conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA. In turn, malonyl-CoA inhibits CPT1, a factor in the outer mitochondrial membrane involved in transport of primed FAs into the mitochondria for oxidation. Phosphorylation of ACC by AMPK inactivates the enzyme, leading to decreased levels of malonyl-CoA and a subsequent increase in β-oxidation of FAs [21]. AMPK also inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, leading to decreased cholesterol synthesis [18]. AMPK plays a role in glucose metabolism by inhibiting gluconeogenesis in the liver (for a review see [18]). Overall, AMPK activity in the liver sustains energy balance by switching on catabolic pathways and inhibiting ATP-consuming pathways, leading to increased FA oxidation and inhibition of lipogenesis and gluconeogenesis.

**Skeletal muscle**

In skeletal muscle, AMPK also affects both lipid and glucose metabolism. More specifically, AMPK increases glucose uptake and enhances FA oxidation and mitochondrial biogenesis [20]. Exercise is a main trigger of AMPK activation in skeletal muscle [75].

AMPK is fundamental to FA metabolism in skeletal muscle [87] because, like in the liver, AMPK phosphorylates and thereby inactivates its downstream target ACC to enhance muscle fat oxidation [19,87]. In addition, AMPK activation results in enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis in skeletal muscle, a process mediated through PGC1α, thereby increasing the metabolic capacity of the tissue [20].

With respect to glucose metabolism, AMPK phosphorylates the Rab GTPase-activating protein AS160, which regulates glucose transport across the cellular membrane independent of insulin [75].

**WAT**

AMPK in WAT also impacts glucose and lipid metabolism. Most studies suggest that AMPK inhibits insulin-stimulated glucose uptake by white adipocytes. As for lipid metabolism, conflicting data on the regulation of lipolysis by AMPK exist that have been extensively reviewed by Bijland et al. [12]. Lipogenesis is thought to activate AMPK since this is an ATP-consuming process. As in liver and muscle, AMPK inactivates ACC in WAT, resulting in reduced FA synthesis and increased FA oxidation [12].

In addition to regulating glucose and lipid metabolism in white adipocytes, AMPK suppresses proinflammatory signalling in the various cell types that constitute WAT, including white adipocytes, endothelial cells, and macrophages. This anti-inflammatory effect could be beneficial in counteracting WAT dysfunction and insulin resistance during obesity [12].

counter-regulatory response by stimulating glucose production by the liver [22–24].

**BAT: function and physiological aspects**

BAT burns glucose and triglyceride-derived FAs [25] and generates heat through the unique presence of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) in brown adipocytes. Thereby, BAT contributes to the maintenance of body temperature in response to cold [26]. Cold sensing is processed by the anterior hypothalamus, which signals to BAT via the SNS. Norepinephrine, released from sympathetic nerve endings, activates BAT by binding to β3-adrenoceptors (ADRB3) on brown adipocytes [26,27]. Besides increasing energy expenditure, BAT activation reduces blood glucose, triglyceride, and even cholesterol concentrations, leading to an improved metabolic phenotype [28,29]. More detailed background information on BAT and its activation can be found in Box 2.

In humans, BAT depots are located in the neck and supraclavicular region and along the spine [2,30,31], whereas in mice BAT is found in distinct depots of which the largest is located between the scapulae [31]. From rodent studies it is evident that, besides brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes also exist, which are mainly situated interspersed within WAT [32,33]. These beige cells resemble white adipocytes in their basal metabolic state but acquire expression levels of UCP1 comparable with levels expressed in BAT on stimulation [32]. The question whether human BAT comprises predominantly beige or brown adipocytes remains a topic of debate. Phenotyping of human biopsies obtained from the supraclavicular region demonstrated that human BAT more closely resembles the beige adipocytes found in WAT depots from mice rather than the classical murine brown adipocytes [32]. In line with this, human preadipocytes isolated from the neck region differentiated into UCP1-positive cells that exhibited predominantly beige characteristics [34]. By contrast, another study established that samples derived from the deep neck fat have many similarities with the classical brown adipocytes found in rodents [35]. Importantly, human UCP1-positive cells (either beige or brown) respond to norepinephrine by enhancing uncoupled respiration [32].

Which β-adrenoceptor subtype is responsible for BAT activation in humans is open to dispute. The β1/2 blocker propranolol decreases uptake of radioactively labelled fluorodeoxyglucose ([¹⁸F]FDG) by BAT as visualised by positron emission tomography (PET) in cancer patients [36]. However, the β3-adrenergic agonist mirabegron substantially increases [¹⁸F]FDG uptake by BAT in humans, demonstrating that predominantly β3-adrenoceptors are involved in the activation of human BAT [37].

**Regulation of BAT activity by hypothalamic AMPK via the SNS**

Studies linking hormones and other compounds to alterations in energy expenditure have revealed clues regarding how BAT activity is regulated. Animal studies have further elucidated the mechanisms underlying the effects of these compounds on energy metabolism.

Hyperthyroidism is a disorder in which excessive amounts of thyroid hormone (T3) are produced, characterised by increased energy expenditure and weight loss [38]. By contrast, estradiol levels are reduced in menopausal women and associated with decreased energy expenditure and weight gain [39]. Similarly, nicotine withdrawal after smoking cessation is related to reduced energy expenditure [40]. Several lines of evidence indicate that T3, estradiol, and nicotine regulate energy expenditure through modulation of hypothalamic AMPK activity. In rats, intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) administration of T3, estradiol, and nicotine activates BAT through downregulation of hypothalamic AMPK activity. When T3 and estradiol were administered, energy expenditure increased while body weight decreased. This was associated with decreased phosphorylation of hypothalamic AMPK and ACC and increased expression of thermogenic markers in BAT. Blocking of ADRB3 on BAT reversed the metabolic effects and expression of thermogenic genes induced by

**Box 2. BAT activation**

BAT activation can be defined as enhanced proton flux through UCP1 resulting in heat production in response to physical or chemical cues. Low environmental temperature is the most potent activator of BAT. Cold sensing is processed by the hypothalamus, which signals to BAT through the SNS. Norepinephrine, released from neural endings, binds to ADRβ3 on brown adipocytes resulting in downstream signalling pathways through cAMP and PKA that lead to activation of BAT [26,27]. Transport of glucose or FAs (derived either from intracellular lipid stores on lipolysis by HSL and ATGL or from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins circulating in the plasma on lipolysis via LPL) into BAT provides substrates for mitochondrial oxidation on BAT activation. Metabolism of glucose and lipids yields NADH and FADH₂, energy-rich molecules that donate electrons to the electron-transport chain. Proteins constituting the electron-transport chain establish a proton gradient across the inner mitochondrial membrane. The energy preserved in this gradient fuels the activity of ATP synthase, which synthesises ATP from ADP. However, the presence of UCP1 in BAT mediates protein leak, disrupting the proton gradient and uncoupling electron transport from ATP synthesis. This results in generation of heat instead of ATP [88,89]. Acute effects of β3-adrenergic stimulation of BAT include increased intracellular lipolysis and subsequent release of FAs that can directly bind to and activate UCP1 [26,27], facilitating

proton transport [90]. Chronic effects of β3-adrenergic activation are reflected by UCP1 transcription, biogenesis, and hyperplasia of BAT [26,27].

In addition to heat generation, BAT activation also improves glucose and triglyceride homeostasis. BAT takes up glucose through glucose transporters on the cellular membrane, including GLUT1 and GLUT4. Translocation of these receptors occurs on insulin stimulation or adrenergic signalling by cold exposure [91]. Stanford et al. [29] showed that BAT transplantation in mice results in improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity [29], underscoring a role for BAT in glucose metabolism. Triglyceride-derived FAs are taken up via an interplay between endothelium-bound LPL and the transmembrane receptor CD36 on brown adipocytes, resulting in uptake of FA [25,91]. Active BAT increases the uptake of lipoprotein/triglyceride-derived FAs from plasma, resulting in lower plasma triglyceride levels [25,28]. As a result, cholesterol-enriched lipoprotein remnants are generated that are subsequently taken up by the liver [25], resulting in lower plasma cholesterol levels [28]. This highlights both a direct and an indirect role of BAT in lipoprotein metabolism. After uptake by BAT, glucose and FAs are stored as triglycerides in lipid droplets and when energy levels are low, triglycerides are hydrolysed by lipases on the lipid droplets and FAs become available for activation of UCP1 [90] or β-oxidation [91].

i.c.v. T3 or estradiol administration, indicating that centrally administered T3- or estradiol-induced BAT activity is mediated by the SNS [7,10]. Subcutaneous nicotine administration was also found to reduce body weight in rats by increasing energy expenditure via a decrease in hypothalamic AMPK phosphorylation and subsequent activation of BAT [9]. The decrease in hypothalamic AMPK is a causal mechanism of central BAT activation, as activation of hypothalamic AMPK by stereotaxic injection of adenoviruses encoding constitutively active AMPKα into the hypothalamus reversed the nicotine- and estradiol-induced negative energy balance [9,10]. In line with the findings from these studies that indicate the importance of hypothalamic AMPK for BAT activation, inactivation of hypothalamic AMPK independent of any compound by expression of a dominant-negative form of AMPKα induces weight loss independent of food intake and upregulation of BAT thermogenic markers [7]. With respect to the human situation, hyperthyroid patients exhibit increased glucose uptake in BAT [41], but it remains unknown whether this is mediated via central AMPK.

α-Lipoic acid (α-LA) is a short-chain FA that acts as a cofactor of enzymes involved in the respiratory chain and is already used clinically to treat diabetic neuropathy [42]. Kim et al. [43] showed that α-LA dose-dependently reduces body weight by increasing energy expenditure in rats, accompanied by increased *Ucp1* mRNA expression in both BAT and WAT. Both intraperitoneal (i.p.) and i.c.v. administration of α-LA decreased hypothalamic AMPK and ACC phosphorylation [43]. Although involvement of the SNS was not directly proved, i.c.v. administration of 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR), an AMP analogue that stimulates AMPK activity, reversed the α-LA-induced increase in energy expenditure, indicating that a decrease in hypothalamic AMPK activity is indeed responsible for the α-LA-induced increase in energy expenditure [43]. Interestingly, in humans α-LA results in modest weight loss in obese subjects [44], although it remains to be determined whether

this is due to enhanced energy expenditure as a consequence of BAT activation.

Agonism of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a successful and widely used therapy for type 2 diabetes [45]. Consistent with the notion that GLP-1 is secreted on positive energy balance, GLP-1R signalling in the central nervous system reduces hypothalamic AMPK activity [46,47] and enhances BAT thermogenesis [45,47]. In rats, i.c.v. treatment with the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide not only induced weight loss independent of food intake and increased *Ucp1* expression in BAT and WAT, but also decreased phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC in the hypothalamus. Both i.c.v. administration of AICAR and overexpression of an adenoviral vector expressing constitutively active AMPK attenuated the weight loss-inducing effect of liraglutide as well as the liraglutide-induced *Ucp1* expression in BAT and WAT [47], supporting a causal role of hypothalamic AMPK inactivation in thermogenesis induced by GLP-1R signalling. Contradictory data on the effect of liraglutide on energy expenditure in humans exist, as liraglutide failed to increase energy expenditure in 4- and 8-week trials [48,49] while increasing energy expenditure in a 1-year trial [47]. The varying length of the treatment periods might explain these different outcomes and a dedicated study investigating the effect of liraglutide on energy expenditure as well as BAT activation is highly warranted.

Bone morphogenetic protein 8b (BMP8B) is a growth factor expressed in BAT for which a role in the regulation of thermogenesis has been suggested [8]. *Bmp8b⁻/⁻* mice have distorted sympathetic outflow to BAT, indicating that BMP8B regulates BAT activity through a central mechanism. BMP8B is also expressed in the hypothalamus and i.c.v. treatment of mice with BMP8B increased body temperature, expression of thermogenic markers in BAT, and neuronal activation in nuclei that coordinate sympathetic outflow to BAT. Surprisingly, mice that were treated i.c.v. with BMP8B exhibited increased, rather than the expected decreased, phosphorylation of hypothalamic AMPKα and

ACCa [8]. These results oppose the effects described for all of the compounds mentioned above [7,9,10,43,47], which increase thermogenesis by reducing hypothalamic AMPK activity. This discrepancy could be explained by the hypothesis that AMPK becomes increasingly active in the brain following BMP8B treatment, counteracting BMP8B’s function in a negative feedback loop to regulate energy balance [8] rather than mediating BMP8B-induced thermogenesis. A possible role for BMP8B in BAT activation in humans remains to be determined.

Overall, evidence from preclinical studies shows that a reduction in hypothalamic AMPK activity leads to increased thermogenesis via increased SNS outflow towards BAT. This contradicts the finding that a reduction in hypothalamic AMPK decreases liver glucose production [24], possibly through decreased SNS outflow towards the liver [23], and thus implies that hypothalamic AMPK signalling induces distinct responses in different organs such as liver and BAT. A positive energy balance on feeding might specifically activate BAT to prevent lipotoxicity [50]. This is supported by the fact that a range of hormones released on feeding (i.e., a positive energy balance), such as GLP-1 [45], leptin [51], and insulin [52], activate BAT.

**Role of AMPK in activation and differentiation of brown adipocytes**

AMPK is highly expressed in brown adipocytes. AMPKα1, the dominant isoform of the catalytic α subunit of AMPK, is more highly expressed in BAT than in liver, suggesting an important role for AMPK in BAT [6]. However, little is known about the role of AMPK activation on brown adipocyte activity besides the effects of systemically administered AMPK-activating compounds, which could have direct or indirect effects. Treatment of brown adipocytes with the AMPK activator AICAR increases glucose uptake [53,54]. In mice, AICAR increases the expression in BAT of cytochrome c, a component of the electron-transport chain [55], which might indicate increased capacity for oxidation. However, as AICAR was administered systemically, this effect may not be specific for BAT.

It is interesting to speculate on other functions of AMPK in BAT, based on what is known for other tissues such as muscle, heart, and WAT. In cultured mouse epididymal adipose tissue, β3-adrenergic stimulation induces phosphorylation of AMPK and ACC and induces expression of the transcriptional co-activator and master regulator of mitochondrial biogenesis Pgc1α [56], which also regulates transcription of Ucp1 [57]. Interestingly, these effects were attenuated in epididymal adipose tissue from AMPKβ1−/− mice. In line with this, epididymal adipose tissue from AMPKβ1−/− mice exhibited reduced mitochondrial protein content, including reduction of PGC1α [56]. This supports the possibility that AMPK is also involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and uncoupling in BAT.

AMPK may stimulate FA oxidation in brown adipocytes, as it does in many other tissues: AMPK-mediated inactivation of ACC releases the inhibitory action of malonyl-CoA on carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1), the rate-limiting enzyme for FA entry into mitochondria for oxidation [12,58]. Correspondingly, the AMPK activator metformin inactivates ACC and enhances expression of regulators of mitochondrial biogenesis and mitochondrial electron-transport chain complexes in BAT *in vivo* [58]. Although these data should be interpreted cautiously as metformin also has targets other than AMPK, this indicates that AMPK in BAT, as in muscle [59] and liver [60], may contribute to mitochondrial biogenesis and may enhance FA oxidation.

It is most likely that AMPK regulates lipolysis in brown adipocytes, but the exact signalling pathways are unknown. In white adipocytes, AMPK phosphorylates adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), which stimulates lipolysis [12,61]. By contrast, AMPK prevents PKA-induced lipolysis by phosphorylating hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) at Ser565 [12,62]. In brown adipocytes, metformin increases lipolysis and phosphorylation of HSL at the classical PKA phosphorylation sites Ser563 and Ser660 but not at Ser565, demonstrating opposite regulation of lipolysis in brown versus white adipocytes [58]. Remarkably, PKA can inactivate AMPK by phosphorylating the complex at Ser173 in white adipocytes, revealing a mechanism by which PKA promotes efficient lipolysis [63]. The occurrence of this mechanism in BAT is also plausible.

AMPK may possibly also increase substrate uptake in BAT by activating lipoprotein lipase (LPL) to release FAs from triglyceride-rich lipoproteins [64] and AMPK might enhance FA uptake by stimulating translocation of the FA transporter CD36 to the plasma membrane, which was shown to be mediated by AMPK in cardiomyocytes [65,66].

Vila-Bedmar et al. [55] have provided evidence for a role of AMPK in brown adipocyte differentiation. In differentiating brown pre-adipocytes *in vitro*, AMPK phosphorylation peaks between days 3 and 7 after induction of adipogenesis, and indirect inhibition of AMPK by iodotubercidin in the early stages of adipocyte differentiation prevents differentiation accompanied by reduced UCP1 expression. In line with these data, continuous i.p. treatment of mice with the AMPK activator AICAR increases browning of WAT [55], overall suggesting that AMPK indeed plays a role in the differentiation of cells towards a brown phenotype [12].

Of note, the abovementioned data are derived from experiments performed in mouse brown adipocytes. The role of AMPK in the activation of human UCP1-positive cells remains to be determined and is an interesting field for future studies.

**Interplay between adrenergic signalling and AMPK in BAT**

When mice are exposed to cold for 15 days, AMPKα1 is upregulated in BAT [6], suggesting that there may be a direct effect of adrenergic signalling on AMPK in BAT. Hutchinson et al. [54] observed that stimulation of brown adipocytes with norepinephrine *in vitro* not only increased UCP1 content but also caused phosphorylation of AMPK [54].

Other *in vivo* studies also suggest that AMPK activity in BAT is regulated by the adrenergic nervous system. For instance, unilateral denervation of sympathetic nerves towards BAT in mice decreased UCP1 protein levels as well as AMPKα1 and α2 protein content and activity. In addition, the ratio of pAMPK<sup>Thr172</sup> to total AMPK α1

protein was decreased on denervation. The authors therefore concluded that total AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 protein levels, as well as activity, are neurally regulated [67].

However, when Mulligan *et al.* [6] continuously infused mice with either norepinephrine or the β3-receptor agonist CL316243 for 14 days using osmotic minipumps, they observed increased UCP1 protein levels without increased AMPKα1 activity in BAT, whereas in WAT AMPKα1 activity was increased. This implies that the cold-induced elevation in AMPKα1 seen after 15 days of cold exposure might be, at least in part, due to a non-sympathetic mechanism. Of note, AMPK activity is not increased after 2, 12, or 24 h of cold [6], indicating that AMPK is not an absolute requisite for the cold-induced processes that directly occur on cold exposure, such as FA oxidation and thermogenesis [6].

When subjected to 14 days of cold, AMPKα1⁻/⁻ mice respond similarly to wild-type (WT) mice with respect to body temperature, hyperphagia, and non-shivering thermogenesis. When AMPKα1⁻/⁻ mice were injected with the β3-adrenergic agonist CL316243, again a similar elevation in body temperature was seen as in WT mice. This could indicate that AMPKα1 is not involved in BAT function, but could also suggest that the other catalytic subunit AMPKα2 takes over part of its function, as AMPKα2 activity is upregulated in BAT when AMPKα1 is lost [68]. Indeed, the AMPKα2 subunit may be more important for BAT function than the AMPKα1 subunit, since AMPKα2⁻/⁻ mice gain more body weight and fat mass than WT mice on a high-fat diet (HFD) although food intake is not affected [69]. In addition, loss of AMPKα2 causes insulin resistance and leads to catecholamine excretion via urine, indicating distorted signalling by the nervous system [19]. The BAT phenotype of AMPKα2⁻/⁻ mice, however, remains to be investigated. As deletion of both the AMPKα1 and AMPKα2 catalytic subunits does not yield a viable phenotype [19], investigating the necessity for total AMPK in adrenergic regulation of thermogenesis is impossible.

Taking these findings together, while the acute effects (i.e., ≤1h) of adrenergic stimulation and cold exposure on AMPK remain to be investigated, chronic cold exposure, chronic treatment with adrenergic agonists, and denervation of BAT affect AMPK levels and activity [6,67]. BAT-specific AMPK⁻/⁻ mice are necessary to shed more light on the role of and necessity for AMPK in thermogenesis.

### Additional AMPK regulators in BAT

The transcriptional co-activator Cidea is highly expressed in BAT. Cidea⁻/⁻ mice have elevated energy expenditure, higher lipolysis in BAT, and increased core body temperature when subjected to cold, suggesting that Cidea is a negative regulator of BAT function [70]. Interestingly, Cidea⁻/⁻ mice have higher AMPKβ content and AMPK activity in BAT; thus, Cidea may inhibit AMPK function and activity in BAT. Cidea directly interacts with the AMPKβ subunit and dose-dependently decreases AMPKβ content, indicating that Cidea promotes AMPKβ degradation. Furthermore, brown adipocytes that lack Cidea exhibit increased AMPK stability, activity, and protein levels. Taking these findings together, Cidea controls the stability of AMPK by targeting AMPKβ for proteasomal degradation by ubiquitination [71]. It remains to be investigated whether other factors exist that affect AMPK activity by this pathway.

Another pathway involving AMPK that could affect brown adipocyte activity is hedgehog signalling. Hedgehog was originally defined as a morphogen with a role in body patterning, but hedgehog activation appears to regulate many cellular processes, including brown adipocyte function. Cyclopamine, a partial hedgehog signalling agonist, increases glucose uptake in brown adipocytes as well as in the BAT of mice. In addition, cyclopamine acutely increases the core body temperature of mice, underscoring a role for hedgehog signalling in BAT activity. Remarkably, cyclopamine also enhances phosphorylation of AMPK in brown adipocytes. Since AMPK is involved in the metabolic effects of hedgehog signalling in white adipocytes, the enhanced glucose uptake by BAT and thermogenesis due to hedgehog partial agonism may also be mediated by AMPK activation [72].

BMP8B affects thermogenesis not only through the hypothalamus as described above, but also by directly acting on BAT. More specifically, treatment of differentiated brown adipocytes with BMP8B increases phosphorylation of AMPK and glycerol release (a measure of lipolysis) on stimulation with norepinephrine [8]. Interestingly, mature brown adipocytes express *Bmp8b* and, in mice, *Bmp8b* expression in BAT is induced on HFD feeding, cold exposure, or injection of the β3-adrenergic agonist CL316243. Thus, BMP8B is induced on nutritional and thermogenic signals in BAT and has an autocrine effect on thermogenesis by enhancing lipolysis and activating AMPK [8].

It is possible that other AMPK signalling pathways in BAT are abundant. For instance, T3 has been demonstrated to phosphorylate AMPK in myoblasts, white adipocytes, thyroid cells, and HeLa cells via binding to the T3 receptor, eventually leading to mitochondrial FA oxidation [73]. As BAT generates and releases T3, thyroid hormone receptors are present in BAT, and activation of these receptors directly increases UCP1 [26]; it is likely that T3 and AMPK are also interconnected in a pathway in brown adipocytes.

#### AMPK activation: cause or consequence of uncoupling in BAT?

In general, AMPK is regarded as an energy-conserving factor, since its activation enhances ATP formation [6]. However, the effects of AMPK on intracellular energy balance in brown adipocytes are debatable. While AMPK activation in most metabolic tissues increases β-oxidation and subsequently ATP synthesis (Box 1), AMPK activation in BAT could enhance β-oxidation but would not result in ATP synthesis due to the presence of UCP1. Therefore, AMPK activity in BAT would result in the ‘wasting’ of stored energy rather than production of ATP. Alternatively, AMPK activation may occur as a consequence rather than being a cause of BAT activation, as uncoupling of the proton gradient from ATP synthesis in BAT leads to decreased intracellular energy levels that activate AMPK. The latter hypothesis fits with the fact that denervation of BAT decreases AMPK content and activity [67], as denervation of BAT reduces the activity of BAT resulting in less

combustion of fat and a subsequent increase in energy status within the brown adipocytes. This conforms to a mechanism proposed by Fritah *et al.* [74] in which increased mitochondrial uncoupling by UCP1 in muscle (in a model lacking a UCP1 transcriptional repressor) leads to an increased AMP/ATP ratio and subsequent AMPK activation. By contrast, β3-adrenergic stimulation increases AMPK phosphorylation in *Ucp1*−/− adipocytes to the same extent as in WT adipocytes, indicating that AMPK activation is independent of the presence of UCP1 [54]. The consequential mechanism proposed by Fritah *et al.* [74]

is challenged by these data, emphasising that future research is necessary to provide clarity on whether AMPK activation is a cause or a consequence of uncoupling in BAT.

Concluding remarks and future perspectives

Figure 1. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity in the brain and in brown adipose tissue (BAT) regulates thermogenesis. Suppression of hypothalamic AMPK activity by low AMP/ATP ratio [11], α-lipoic acid (α-LA) [43], estradiol [10], GLP-1 [47], nicotine [9], or thyroid hormone (T3) [7] increases sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity resulting in norepinephrine (NE) release and stimulation of β3-adrenergic receptors (ADRB3s) on the brown adipocyte membrane [7,9,10,43]. Intracellularly, the protein kinase A (PKA) pathway is activated by an increase in cAMP, leading to increased lipolysis and heat production. AMPK activation within brown adipocytes by high AMP/ATP ratio [11], 5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide-1-β-D-ribofuranoside (AICAR) [53–55], berberine [78], gallic acid [79], metformin [58], or resveratrol [80–82] is associated with higher activity of BAT [6,54,58]. This might be due to AMPK-mediated activation of lipoprotein lipase (LPL) [64] and translocation of CD36 to the plasma membrane, collectively resulting in enhanced triglyceride (TG)-derived fatty acid (FA) uptake by the brown adipocytes [65,66]. AMPK could also increase intracellular lipolysis by phosphorylation of adipocyte TG lipase (ATGL) and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL). Moreover, AMPK alleviates the inhibition of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1 (CPT1) by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), resulting in increased FA transport into mitochondria [12,58]. Together these signalling pathways enhance heat production by brown adipocytes.

**Review**

AMPK is a crucial mediator of SNS activity since activation of hypothalamic AMPK can reverse the thermogenic effects of several centrally acting compounds. The role of peripheral AMPK activation in BAT remains uncertain; on the one hand BAT activation is often associated with increased AMPK phosphorylation both *in vitro* and *in vivo* [6,54] (Figure 1), but on the other hand AMPKa1 deficiency does not lead to defective thermogenesis [68]. The necessity of AMPK in BAT for BAT activation thus remains to be assessed, as AMPK activation could also be a consequence rather than a cause of BAT activation.

AMPK activation in metabolic tissues is frequently suggested as an attractive target in the treatment of obesity and related disorders as it inhibits gluconeogenesis in the liver [18] and accounts for insulin-independent glucose uptake in resting skeletal muscle [75], collectively resulting in improved glucose homeostasis. Since AMPK stimulates catabolic pathways to generate ATP, it can be speculated that AMPK activation in BAT leads to increased uncoupling of energy and therefore heat production instead of generation of ATP. Mice that overexpress uncoupling proteins show increased AMPK activity and are protected from diet-induced obesity, supporting the possibility that AMPK activation is involved in the reduction of obesity when uncoupling proteins are abundant [76,77]. The uncoupling capacity of BAT would also prevent any increase in ATP levels on AMPK activation, thereby avoiding the negative feedback mechanism that inhibits AMPK. If this holds true, AMPK activation specifically in the energy-consuming BAT might be a promising strategy to reduce obesity, as a vicious energy-burning cycle is initiated during which generated energy can be directly released in the form of heat.

Various compounds have been shown to increase BAT activity via, or in association with, an increase in AMPK, including metformin [58], berberine [78], gallic acid [79], and resveratrol [80–82]. Of note, these compounds were not specifically targeted towards BAT in these studies. Hence, AMPK activation in other peripheral organs could have contributed to the reported compound effects such as improved glucose metabolism, increased energy expenditure, and reduced body weight and plasma lipid levels. Studies that investigate the effect of AMPK activation in BAT specifically are warranted to investigate its therapeutic potential. BAT is present and active in humans and AMPK activators such as metformin have beneficial metabolic effects such as weight loss [83–85] and reduced plasma triglyceride levels [86]; however, it remains to be determined whether these compounds also act via activating AMPK in BAT in humans.

Although activating AMPK in BAT seems promising, the paradox of AMPK activation in BAT remains: why is this energy-saving kinase so highly expressed in this energy-wasting tissue? As both BAT and AMPK hold therapeutic potential for the treatment of obesity and associated disorders, their interconnection and modulation are undoubtedly worth further investigation.
