Metal acquisition is a vital microbial process in metal-scarce environments, such as inside a host. Using metabolomic exploration, targeted mutagenesis, and biochemical analysis, we discovered an operon in *Staphylococcus aureus* that encodes the different functions required for the biosynthesis and trafficking of a broad-spectrum metallophore related to plant nicotianamine (here called staphylopine). The biosynthesis of staphylopine reveals the association of three enzyme activities: a histidine racemase, an enzyme distantly related to nicotianamine synthase, and a staphylopine dehydrogenase belonging to the DUF2338 family. Staphylopine is involved in nickel, cobalt, zinc, copper, and iron acquisition, depending on the growth conditions. This biosynthetic pathway is conserved across other pathogens, thus underscoring the importance of this metal acquisition strategy in infection.

Metals are required in many life processes, and consequently all organisms have developed mechanisms for their uptake and homeostasis. Pathogenic bacteria must face an additional barrier of metal limitation that is usually set by the host, precisely in order to prevent bacterial growth (1). This strategy of “nutritional immunity” by the hosts also extends to many micronutrients with dedicated mechanisms of sequestration for iron, manganese, or zinc (2, 3). The paradigm of metal acquisition in metal-deprived environments is associated with iron: Whereas one strategy consists in transporting the reduced form, the most common scheme involves the synthesis of high-affinity ferric siderophores, their extracellular release before capture, and import of the siderophore-Fe${}^{3+}$ complex (4). These siderophores are frequently associated with virulence and may also be used for the transport of metals other than iron (5, 6), with only a few examples of other types of microbial metallophores. Methanobactin, for example, is a peptide-based chalkophore used for copper scavenging by methane-oxidizing bacteria (7). Free L-histidine (L-His) is used as a nickelophore by some bacteria, and more complex molecules are possibly used by *Staphylococcus aureus* or *Helicobacter pylori*, although their identity or functional relevance are unknown (8, 9). Recently, a nickel/cobalt uptake system (called CntA-F) was uncovered in *S. aureus* and was found to play a role in the virulence of this strain (10).

Plants have also evolved their own metal chelators, and among them, nicotianamine is an important metabolite that is essential in the homeostasis of iron, copper, nickel, and zinc (11, 12). Nicotianamine is also the first precursor of phytosiderophores, a family of molecules chemically different from but functionally equivalent to siderophores (13). Nicotianamine is enzymatically synthesized by nicotianamine synthase (NAS), which catalyzes the condensation of three α-aminobutyric acid moieties from S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) with the cyclization of one of them to form an azetidine ring (14–16). Nicotianamine and its phytosiderophore derivatives seem to be restricted to plants and some fungi, although some archaea apparently produce a nicotianamine-related molecule called thermonicotianamine, the functional role of which remains unknown (17).

Trying to better understand this family of plant NAS and archaeal NAS-like enzymes, we found a gene putatively coding for a NAS-like enzyme in bacterial genomes, including that of *S. aureus*. The NAS-like gene from *S. aureus* (*sav2469*), here called *cntL*, shares 12% sequence identity with one of the four NASs from *Arabidopsis thaliana*, which corresponds to a very distant homology. However, threading-based structure prediction programs detected a structural homology of CntL with eukaryotic NAS and archaeal NAS-like enzymes (fig. S1). The gene coding for CntL is systematically located upstream of a gene whose product belongs to the DUF2338 family (*cntM* in *S. aureus*, *sav2468*; Fig. 1 and fig. S2). Threading-based prediction indicates with high confidence that this family of protein is related to octopine dehydrogenase, a NAD(P)H-dependent enzyme that reductively condensates a free amino acid, such as arginine, with an α-ketoacid, such as pyruvate (18). This family of enzymes is known to be involved in the escape of scallops from their starfish predators (19) or in the growth of parasitic bacteria, such as *Agrobacterium tumefaciens*, at the expense of plants in which they induce opine-producing tumors, offering bacteria a selective growth advantage (20). In *S. aureus*, the gene upstream of *cntL* (*cntK*, *sav2470*) appears restricted to the phylum of Firmicutes and encodes a protein that is distantly related to a diaminopymelate epimerase (DapF).

On the basis of these predictions, the putative activity of each of these three enzymes could be joined together to form a biosynthetic machinery: The CntK epimerase would produce an amine substrate of proper stereochemistry that would be

modified by the CntL NAS-like enzyme through the addition of one or two α-aminobutyric acid moieties, and CntM would reductively condensate an α-ketoacid to the previously formed product, leading to the formation of a candidate molecule. Although their putative activity was not recognized at the time, the three corresponding genes (cntKLM) were shown to belong to an operonic structure involved in the import of nickel and cobalt ions through an ABC transporter named cntA-F (8) (Fig. 1A). Two independent genetic studies targeting either the solute binding protein (SBP; cntA) or the MFS transporter (major facilitator superfamily, here called cntE) indicated that this operon is important for the virulence and fitness of *S. aureus* (10, 21). The phenotype of these mutations could be reconciled by the hypothesis of a siderophore-like system with a biosynthetic machinery (CntKLM), a putative exporter (CntE), and a putative importer of a metal-metallophore complex (CntABCDF).

We attempted to identify the candidate metallophore through an ab initio approach using *Escherichia coli* or *S. aureus* strains and through a knowledge-based approach using purified proteins (22). For the first approach, we cloned the entire 10-kb cnt operon (cntKLMABCDFE) in *E. coli* and induced gene expression and protein production. After adding nickel, we tracked small molecules co-eluting with nickel by metabolomic studies using hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC; fig. S3). We also constructed a mutant strain of *S. aureus* devoid of the cntL gene and cultivated both the wild-type (WT) and this mutant strains in chemically defined medium (CDM), a medium with low metal concentration, in which expression of the operon is known (10). We then detected metal complexes in the extracellular fractions by coupling HILIC separation with inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) (Fig. 1). A main peak was found to elute between 30 and 33 min in the HILIC/ICP-MS experiment, with the retention time depending on the detected metal (Fig. 1B). In all the cases, these peaks were absent in the cntL mutant strain, therefore corroborating our central hypothesis of the existence of a direct link between these metal complexes and the central NAS-like enzyme. Investigation of these metal complexes by coupling HILIC and ESI-MS led us to find a candidate molecule showing the characteristic metal isotopic patterns (Fig. 1C and fig. S3). The retention times of these compounds in HILIC/ESI-MS match those of the metals elution found by HILIC/ICP-MS, indicating that the same metal complexes were observed by the two techniques. The knowledge-based approach consisted of trapping the nickel-metallophore complex: We expressed and purified the SBP (CntA) from *E. coli* and incubated it in a supernatant of a cntA mutant of *S. aureus* grown in CDM medium. We then supplemented this mix with nickel to force nickel-metallophore complex formation and binding to CntA. After repurification of the SBP and further analysis by MS, we looked for the characteristic nickel isotopic pattern and found a candidate molecule with the same mass as found by the metabolomic approaches (fig. S4). Using our set of accurate masses with molecular formula finder software programs, we proposed an empirical formula of C₁₃H₁₉N₄O₆-metal.

We attempted to fit this formula by using simple rules derived from our proposed enzymes activities and putative substrates (22), and we finally propose the structure of a candidate molecule that would be the result of three biosynthetic enzyme activities: (i) racemization of L-His in D-His by CntK, (ii) nucleophilic attack of one α-aminobutyric acid moiety from SAM onto D-His to produce an intermediate (denoted xNA) by CntL, and (iii) reductive condensation of the xNA intermediate with a molecule of pyruvate by CntM (Fig. 2A). Gas-phase fragmentation of zinc and nickel metal complexes confirmed the proposed structure of the discovered molecule (fig. S5), which we name staphylopine to recall its origin in *S. aureus* and its inclusion in the opine family (23).

We then tested and refined this hypothetical biosynthetic pathway by cloning, expressing, and purifying the three enzymes and testing their respective activities (Fig. 2, B to D, and fig. S6). First, we incubated CntK with L- or D-His and found that it indeed produces D-His from the L-stereoisomer and vice versa, thus establishing CntK as a histidine racemase (Fig. 2B). Because co-incubation with L-His and a competing concentration of either L-alanine or L-methionine did not inhibit the histidine racemase activity, CntK appears to be specific for histidine (fig. S7). CntK is therefore not a diaminopimelate epimerase as its sequence similarity could suggest, but rather represents a novel enzyme family of histidine racemase. With regard to CntL, we determined a dissociation constant (*K*~d~) of 68 μM for SAM, which corroborates our central hypothesis that CntL binds to SAM (fig. S8). We then tested our prediction suggesting the binding of NAD(P)H to CntM by incubating either NADH or NADPH with the purified enzyme. This indicated a preference of the enzyme for NADPH, and fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between the tryptophan residue of the protein (excitation 280 nm, emission 340 nm) and NAD(P)H (340 nm and 460 nm, respectively) further revealed that CntM is specific for NADPH, with a *K*~d~ of about 50 μM (Fig. 2C), a value that was confirmed with microcalorimetric titrations (fig. S8). Therefore, CntM has the biochemical characteristics of members of the opine synthase enzyme family, as suggested by the results of threading programs.

We then investigated the combined enzymatic activities of CntK, CntL, and CntM through the

use of a carboxyl-[14C]-labeled SAM substrate. The use of this radiolabeled substrate allowed us to follow the α-aminobutyric acid moiety of SAM after product separation by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) and autoradiography. We found that [14C]-labeled SAM alone gave one strong band, with three bands of lower intensity, probably corresponding to SAM and some degradation products, such as S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (Fig. 2D). Although the incubation of [14C]-SAM with CntL and L-His did not change this SAM pattern, the incubation with D-His led to a novel prominent band, which migrated below the lowest SAM band (Fig. 2D). According to our model, this band corresponds to the intermediate called xNA. We then tested the effect of co-incubating both CntL and CntM enzymes together with their putative substrates: L- and D-His, pyruvate, and NADPH (Fig. 2D, lanes 4 and 5). Here again the SAM pattern stayed unchanged when L-His was used. However, using D-His, we could detect two novel bands: one corresponding to the previous intermediate xNA and one that migrated between the two upper bands of SAM and would correspond to staphylopine. This identification is further supported by the fact that the staphylopine band appears at the expense of the xNA intermediate, as expected in such a case. We also confirmed the histidine racemase activity of CntK by co-incubating all three enzymes together with their substrates. In this case, the incubation with L- or D-His both led to the appearance of the xNA and staphylopine bands, in accordance with the CntK activity, which produces both L- and D-His when supplied with either stereoisomer (Fig. 2D, lanes 6 and 7). Incubation of the three enzymes

with different aminoacids, α-keto acids, and reducing agents confirmed that the histidine racemase CntK is indeed specific for histidine and that CntM could use neither NADH nor α-keto glutarate in place of NADPH and pyruvate, respectively (fig. S9). Overall, these in vitro studies of the three biosynthetic enzymes show that they sequentially synthesize staphylopine according to our proposed scheme, using common and defined substrates.

We confirmed that staphylopine biosynthesis is impaired in the *cntL* mutant of *S. aureus* and explored the effect of mutations of several genes in the *cnt* operon on metal homeostasis and staphylopine production and trafficking (Fig. 3). When compared to the WT strain of *S. aureus*, both the xNA and the staphylopine bands disappeared in the *cntL* mutant, confirming that both bands are dependent on CntL activity (Fig. 3A). Furthermore, the bands corresponding to xNA and staphylopine migrated at the same distance in *E. coli* or *S. aureus* cell extracts, confirming that both molecules are produced heterologously in *E. coli*.

We next sought to determine the effect of the *cntL* mutation with regard to intracellular metal accumulation in various culture conditions: CDM, where metal concentration is rather low; Chelex-dematelated CDM (dCDM), where the metal level is even lower; nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA)-demetalated CDM supplemented with metalated NTA resin to supposedly mimic a chelating environment (rCDM); and lysogeny broth (LB), where metal concentration is high. The growth of the *cntL* mutant was nearly identical to that of the WT strain in these media (fig. S10), indicating that metal content would be attributable to the absence of staphylopine and not to a growth defect. In all these culture conditions, we established that the *cnt* genes, transcribed from two promoters upstream, *cntKLM* and *cntA-E*, are highly expressed in metal-poor media, whereas their activities are lower but still significant in LB (fig. S11). In CDM and dCDM, the *cntL* mutation caused a decrease in the intracellular accumulation of nickel, copper, and cobalt as determined by ICP-MS (Fig. 3B and fig. S12A). This metal accumulation defect is comparable to the one observed in the *cntA-F* mutant, indicating that metal or metal-staphylopine complexes are transported via CntA (Fig. 3B). This defect in metal accumulation is complemented when the *cntL* gene is reintroduced in the mutant, although using slightly different conditions adapted for ICP-AES metal content determination (fig. S13). In this case, there is no decrease in intracellular copper, but a decrease in intracellular zinc,

nickel, and cobalt. In rCDM, the tendency observed in CDM is confirmed, although in this condition iron, zinc, copper, nickel, and cobalt content are all affected in the mutant strain as compared to the wild type (fig. S12B). Finally, in a metal-rich medium such as LB, the *cntL* deletion mutant accumulated less iron, copper, and cobalt (fig. S12C).

Taken together, these sets of experiments suggest that depending on the nature of the metal, its concentration, and the bacterial growth status, staphylopine is involved in the import of a large array of divalent metals in *S. aureus*. Testing metal transport over 10 min supports the involvement of both staphylopine and CntA-F in the import of all these metals. Indeed, the import of iron, zinc, nickel, and cobalt are all decreased in both *cntL* and *cntA-F* mutants (Fig. 3C). The short-term transport of iron and zinc is consistent with their known regulatory effect exerted on the *cnt* operon (10, 21). The transport of copper is somehow different, because WT cells efficiently export this metal during this short time, probably in response to its toxicity. In this case, the absence of CntL or CntA-F appears to decrease this toxicity and its consecutive efflux.

In order to investigate the transport of metal-staphylopine complexes through CntA, we exploited the sensitivity of *S. aureus* to high cobalt concentration. We found that *cntL* and *cntA-F* mutant strains are resistant to a concentration of cobalt that is toxic to the WT strain, whereas supplementation of synthetic staphylopine in the media restores its toxicity in the *cntL* but not in *cntA-F* strain (fig. S14). This suggests a cotransport of cobalt-staphylopine complexes via CntA-F, because the ABC transporter is still present in the *cntL* mutant (hence the cobalt toxicity), whereas it is absent in the *cntA-F* mutant (where cobalt-staphylopine cannot enter the cell). Finally, we measured the staphylopine level in the intracellular and supernatant fractions of the WT, *cntABCDF*, *cntL*, and *cntE* mutants (Fig. 3D). This experiment confirmed the absolute need for CntL in the biosynthesis of staphylopine, further supported the function of CntA-F in the import of staphylopine-metal complexes, and clearly indicated that CntE is involved in the export of staphylopine. Overall, despite being distantly related, staphylopine apparently mirrors the effect that nicotianamine has on the same range of metals but in the context of metal homeostasis and transport in plants (17). Chemically synthesized staphylopine has the same range of metal affinity as nicotianamine (similar *K*<sub>d</sub> and affinity order: Cu<sup>2+</sup> > Ni<sup>2+</sup> > Co<sup>2+</sup> > Zn<sup>2+</sup> > Fe<sup>2+</sup>; fig. S15),

further supporting their functional comparison as broad-spectrum metallophores.

The biosynthesis of staphylopine aggregates three unprecedented enzyme activities with the use of D-His, the fusion of a single α-aminobutyric acid moiety from SAM, and the fabrication of an opine derivative (Fig. 4). This latter activity was so far restricted to plants’ bacterial transfection or anaerobic glycolysis in marine invertebrates (19, 23). The use of histidine as a building block is interesting, because the free amino acid has a relatively high affinity for nickel on its own and is directly used for nickel uptake by bacteria (8, 24–26). However, the use of the D- stereoisomer of histidine is surprising because D- amino acids are mainly used in cell wall biosynthesis and have been mostly restricted to alanine and glutamate (27), although other “non-canonical” D- amino acids are reported to be involved in the composition of the cell wall (28, 29), biofilm stability (30), virulence (31), or sporulation (32). Another peculiarity of the staphylopine biosynthetic machinery resides in the NAS-like CntL enzyme that only uses one α-aminobutyric acid moiety from SAM, whereas the NAS-like enzyme from *M. thermotautrophicum* uses two, and plant enzymes use three such moieties. The evolution from bacterial staphylopine to plants’ nicotianamine preserves a large part of the molecule’s backbone, therefore suggesting a conservative chemical evolution occurring together with enzymatic simplifications, in which plant nicotianamine is synthesized by a single enzyme. Finally, homologous genes involved in staphylopine biosynthesis are conserved in other pathogenic bacteria such as *Yersinia pestis* or *Pseudomonas aeruginosa*, underscoring the likely influence of this metallophore in bacterial pathogenicity. Indeed, the export pathway of this metallophore was recently identified as a critical function for the growth of *P. aeruginosa* in airway mucus secretions, where metal access is severely limited (33).

New particle formation (NPF) is the source of over half of the atmosphere's cloud condensation nuclei, thus influencing cloud properties and Earth’s energy balance. Unlike in the planetary boundary layer, few observations of NPF in the free troposphere exist. We provide observational evidence that at high altitudes, NPF occurs mainly through condensation of highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs), in addition to taking place through sulfuric acid–ammonia nucleation. Neutral nucleation is more than 10 times faster than ion-induced nucleation, and growth rates are size-dependent. NPF is restricted to a time window of 1 to 2 days after contact of the air masses with the planetary boundary layer; this is related to the time needed for oxidation of organic compounds to form HOMs. These findings require improved NPF parameterization in atmospheric models.

Atmospheric aerosols influence climate through direct interaction with radiation and by acting as cloud condensation nuclei (1, 2). There is considerable uncertainty about what fraction of cloud condensation nuclei is attributable to new particle formation (NPF) (3–5). Studies of NPF in the free troposphere have used ground-based (6–9) and airborne (10) platforms but with limited instrumentation and/or over short time scales. Because of the lack of data at high altitudes, the vast majority of models use free-troposphere NPF schemes in which particle formation rates depend only on the concentration of sulfuric acid, relative humidity, and temperature (11). Recently, comprehensive NPF measurements performed as part of the CLOUD (Cosmics Leaving Outdoor Droplets) project detected ternary nucleation of sulfuric acid with water and oxidized organics (12). Implementation of this NPF scheme in GLOMAP (Global Model of Aerosol Processes) (13) yielded a photochemically and biologically driven seasonal cycle of particle concentrations in the continental boundary layer, comparable to observations (12). Further CLOUD experiments observed NPF without involvement of sulfuric acid, which is expected to be important especially in pristine regions and the preindustrial atmosphere (14). These laboratory and modeling studies call for field verification.

To chemically and physically characterize the early stage of NPF in the free troposphere, we used a suite of state-of-the-art mass spectrometers and particle counters at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch (JFJ), Switzerland [3580 m above sea level (15)]. At this site, NPF occurs on 15 to 20% of days, without apparent seasonal dependence (fig. S9), as shown by long-term observations (16) and dedicated campaigns (17). We report measurements collected over the period of a year, including two intensive 1-month campaigns (table S1).

We identified three typical situations, represented by consecutive example days (days 1 to 3) (Fig. 1); in addition, we show a special case (day 4)

where the sulfuric acid concentration was unusually high (~6 × 10⁶ cm⁻³). Day 1 (25 February 2014) is an example of one of the many non-event days during sunny conditions. During the afternoon, there is a slight enhancement in the concentration of 5- to 10-nm particles, but the simultaneous increase in larger particles (up to 90 nm) suggests that this enhancement is related to vertical transport of particles formed elsewhere (15). Day 2 (26 February 2014) is typical of days when the JFJ is within clouds, when NPF is suppressed by reduced global radiation and the high condensation sink of the cloud droplets. Days 3 and 4 (27 February and 2 March 2014) are two examples of NPF days, classified as 1A events (15), where the number concentration of particles larger than 3.2 nm increases strongly from a few hundred to 40,000 cm⁻³.

On most sunny days, the sulfuric acid concentration followed a consistent diurnal cycle, with concentrations <10⁴ cm⁻³ during the night and ≤5 × 10⁵ cm⁻³ during the day (except day 4, which had much higher concentrations). However, no link was found between sulfuric acid and NPF, suggesting that sulfuric acid at these concentrations does not explain NPF at the JFJ (Fig. 1D). Highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs), which we detected with a chemical ionization–atmospheric pressure interface–time of flight mass spectrometer (CI-API-TOF), were formed on some sunny days (e.g., day 3) but not on others (e.g., day 1) (Fig. 1D). This variability is probably dependent on the presence of organic precursors in the free troposphere. Figure 1E shows the time evolution

Editor's Summary

A new metal scavenger for bacteria

All cells must find a way to acquire trace metals. Bacteria and plants scavenge iron, for instance, by synthesizing and releasing iron-chelating compounds called siderophores. Ghssein *et al.* describe three enzymes in *Staphylococcus aureus* that are responsible for the biosynthesis of another type of metallophore (see the Perspective by Nolan). Metabolomics and a range of biochemical assays show that this compound, named staphylopine, is involved in the uptake of a range of metals, depending on the growth environment. The genes required for staphylopine biosynthesis are conserved across a number of pathogenic bacteria and are similar to those for a broad-spectrum metallophore produced by plants.
