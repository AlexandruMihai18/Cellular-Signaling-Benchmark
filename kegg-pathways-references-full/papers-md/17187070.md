Tyrosine kinases couple the T cell receptor (TCR) to discrete signaling cascades, each of which is capable of inducing a distinct functional outcome. Precisely how TCR signals are channeled toward specific targets remains unclear. TCR stimulation triggers ‘alternative’ activation of the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38, whereby the Lck and Zap70 tyrosine kinases directly activate p38. Here we report that alternatively activated p38 associated with the Dlgh1 MAGUK scaffold protein. ‘Knockdown’ of Dlgh1 expression blocked TCR-induced activation of p38 and the transcription factor NFAT but not of the mitogen-activated protein kinase Jnk or transcription factor NF-κB. A Dlgh1 mutant incapable of binding p38 failed to activate NFAT. Along with reports that the CARMA1 MAGUK scaffold protein coordinates activation of Jnk and NF-κB but not of p38 or NFAT, our findings identify MAGUK scaffold proteins as ‘orchestrators’ of TCR signal specificity.

Adaptive immunity relies on the effective induction of an antigen-specific T cell response. Central to that process is the binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to specific antigenic complexes of peptides in major histocompatibility complex molecules expressed on antigen-presenting cells (APCs). When the TCR is engaged in the appropriate context, signals are transmitted that culminate in T cell development, activation and effector function. Mechanisms by which TCR-proximal kinase activity is selectively directed toward a discrete subset of ‘downstream’ pathways to effect particular outcomes are poorly characterized. In other signaling systems, wherein common transducers are selectively channeled toward one of several available downstream pathways, scaffolding proteins have emerged as key ‘orchestrators’ of signal specificity¹⁻⁴.

In response to TCR stimulation and CD28 costimulation, the cooperative activation of the TCR-proximal tyrosine kinases Lck and Zap70 initiate the phosphorylation, recruitment and activation of adaptors, scaffolds and other signal transducers. Adaptors and scaffolds such as Lat, SLP-76, Fyb (also called SLAP), Grb2, CARMA1 and Dlgh1 have no inherent enzymatic activity, although they are crucial for the proper positioning and activation of signal transducers in signaling microdomains at the T cell–APC interface⁵⁻¹⁰. Signal transducers include tyrosine and serine-threonine kinases, phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase, phospholipase C-γ1 and several small GTPases. Those molecules activate enzymatic signaling cascades and modify the conformation and binding capacity of scaffolds, adaptors or lipids in such a way as to facilitate the progressive assembly and activation of signal-transduction modules. The resulting membrane-proximal ‘signalosomes’ induce signaling relays that activate transcription factors, including NFAT and NF-κB, and ultimately lead to T cell activation¹¹,¹². Although NFAT and NF-κB both rely on TCR-induced activation of Zap70 and Lck¹³,¹⁴, those transcription factors are not always coordinately regulated and can elicit distinct transcriptional programs⁹,¹²,¹⁵.

Of the serine-threonine kinases activated in response to TCR and CD28 engagement, p38 is among the best characterized, but how it is regulated by TCR signaling is only now being elucidated¹⁶. It is a member of the mitogen-activated protein kinase family and has been linked to T helper cell type 1 differentiation and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) production¹⁷,¹⁸. Initially, p38 was thought to be exclusively activated through phosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182 by dual kinases called ‘mitogen-activated protein kinase kinases’ (MKKs). However, findings have indicated that an ‘alternative’ MKK-independent mechanism of p38 activation operates in response to TCR engagement¹⁹. Alternative p38 activation relies on direct Lck- and Zap70-mediated phosphorylation of p38 at Tyr323, which in turn induces autophosphorylation at Thr180 and Tyr182, resulting in complete p38 activation. The importance of that pathway in regulating T cell activity is emphasized by the T cell hyperproliferation and autoimmunity of mice deficient in the growth-arrest gene Gadd45a, which fail to downregulate alternative p38 activity²⁰. Because Lck and Zap70 can directly activate p38, TCR coupling to the alternative pathway suggests that proximal TCR signals are split toward independently controlled downstream pathways. How that split is orchestrated is not yet understood.

The Dlgh1 MAGUK family scaffold protein mediates NFAT activation and lymphokine production triggered by TCR ligation and is a ligand of Zap70 and Lck^{6,21,22}. However, the molecular basis by which Dlgh1 contributes to NFAT activation and whether Dlgh1 also participates in NF-κB activation or other TCR-induced signaling pathways is not clear. Here we have identified p38 as a Dlgh1-interacting protein and mapped the site of interaction to the Dlgh1 PDZ domains. In addition, we provide evidence supporting the involvement of Dlgh1 as a molecular scaffold that orchestrates Lck- and Zap70-mediated phosphorylation of p38 at Tyr323 and couples p38 activity to activation of NFAT but not NF-κB. Our findings demonstrate a mechanism through which TCR-proximal kinase activity is selectively channeled toward alternative p38 activation and NFAT activation. Other data indicate that the MAGUK family member CARMA1 regulates Jnk and NF-κB but not p38 or NFAT^{23–27}. These findings collectively pinpoint MAGUK proteins as mediators of TCR signal specificity.

**RESULTS**

Dlgh1 orchestrates alternative p38 activation

Scaffolding proteins have emerged as central organizers of multi-component signaling complexes in many systems^{6,7,28,29}. They accomplish an essential function by creating focal points for control of signal-transduction cascades. Modular protein-binding domains in scaffolds coordinate complex assembly and activity through regulated intra- and intermolecular protein binding^{4,30}. Dlgh1 contains multiple protein-interaction domains and therefore identification of Dlgh1-interacting proteins in T cells is essential for understanding Dlgh1 function. To identify Dlgh1-binding proteins, we analyzed by immunoblot Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates from T cells stimulated with antibody to CD3 (anti-CD3) and anti-CD28. The Dlgh1-p38 association was first visible in BI-141 T hybridoma cells 5 min after stimulation (Fig. 1a). In contrast, in primary OT-1 TCR-transgenic T cells (Fig. 1b) and OT-1 T hybridoma cells (data not shown), Dlgh1 was constitutively associated with p38. Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates were specifically enriched for activated p38 phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182; phosphorylated p38 was not detected in the unbound fraction from stimulated samples (Fig. 1a).

Dlgh1 contains several modular domains, including a unique proline-rich N-terminal domain, three PDZ (PSD-95-Dlg-ZO-1) domains, an SH3 (Src homology 3) domain and a GUK (guanylate kinase-like) domain. To define the molecular basis of the Dlgh1-p38 association, we incubated glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion proteins containing full-length Dlgh1 or truncated mutants of Dlgh1 (Fig. 1c) with lysates from activated T cells. We found that p38 associated with full-length GST-Dlgh1 and with a truncated GST-Dlgh1 fusion protein containing the three PDZ domains (Fig. 1d,e). Indeed, p38 contains a consensus PDZ domain-binding motif at residues 346–348 in its C terminus. WASP, another protein containing a consensus PDZ domain-binding motif, did not associate with the PDZ domains but instead associated with the SH3 domain of Dlgh1 (Fig. 1e). These data emphasized the specificity of the Dlgh1-p38 interaction.

To determine if p38 associates with Dlgh1 through consensus PDZ residues, we introduced point mutations known to abolish binding to PDZ domains^{31} individually in the sequences encoding each Dlgh1 PDZ domain (constructs PDZ1, PDZ2 and PDZ3) or in all PDZ domains concomitantly (construct PDZ123; Fig. 1c). We transfected 293T cells with equal amounts of expression vectors containing wild-type Dlgh1 or the Dlgh1 point mutants deficient in PDZ binding. We probed Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates for interaction with p38. The Dlgh1-p38 association was similar for wild-type Dlgh1 and the PDZ1, PDZ2 and PDZ3 Dlgh1 constructs but was lower in PDZ123 Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 1f). Endogenous Dlgh1 present in 293T cells probably contributed to the residual p38 found in Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates from cells expressing PDZ123.

TCR ligation activates Lck and Zap70, which cooperate to directly phosphorylate p38 at Tyr323, resulting in p38 activation and autophosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 (ref. 19). Phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 is blocked by p38 pharmacological inhibitors^{19}. Similarly, as phosphorylation of Tyr323 depends on Lck and Zap70, incubation with a Src kinase inhibitor is predicted to inhibit phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182. Conventional p38 activation relies on activation by ‘upstream’ MKKs and thus is not affected by addition of p38 inhibitors. To determine whether Dlgh1 complexes could mediate alternative p38 activation, we did an *in vitro* kinase assay in the presence or absence of p38 or Lck inhibitors. The addition of the

Data are representative of three (a,b) or three to five (c,d) independent experiments.

p38 inhibitor diminished phosphorylation of p38 at Thr180 and Tyr182 in Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates (Fig. 2a). Furthermore, phosphorylation of Dlgh1-associated Zap70 and p38 was impaired in the presence of the Lck inhibitor. These data indicated that Dlgh1 complexes can support alternative p38 activation in a cell-free system.

Next we used a published small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy to diminish Dlgh1 expression in primary T cells⁶. To examine the effects of reduced Dlgh1 on TCR-induced alternative p38 activation, we stimulated OT-1 T cells with antigen-pulsed APCs, then transfected the cells with control or Dlgh1-specific siRNA and stimulated them with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. We immunoprecipitated p38, did in vitro kinase assays and detected by immunoblot the presence of p38 phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182 (Fig. 2b–d). We detected ATP-dependent p38 phosphorylation in cells transfected with control siRNA; it was lower in p38 immunoprecipitates from cells transfected with Dlgh1-specific siRNA (Fig. 2b). These data were consistent with involvement of Dlgh1 in TCR-induced alternative p38 activation.

To assess whether Dlgh1 participates in alternative p38 activation in intact cells, we obtained lysates from unstimulated T cells or T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and assessed the presence of p38 phosphorylated at Tyr323 (a modification occurring only during ‘alternative’ p38 activation) and/or at Thr180 and Tyr182 (a modification made during both alternative and canonical p38 activation). We detected phosphorylation of Tyr323 as well as of Thr180 and Tyr182 after stimulation in T cells transfected with control siRNA (Fig. 2c,d). The antibody specific for phosphorylated Tyr180 and Tyr182 was a more sensitive antibody than the antibody to phosphorylated Tyr323. Therefore, phosphorylation of Thr180 and Tyr182 was more easily detected at early time points (Fig. 2c,d). Nonetheless, increased exposure of the Tyr323 immunoblot produced a signal at the 5-minute point (data not shown). As we noted both phosphorylation events at every activation time point tested, our findings cannot be used to order those events. Nonetheless, our data are consistent with published literature indicating that Tyr323 ‘drives’ p38 autophosphorylation. However, T cells transfected with Dlgh1-specific siRNA showed impaired phosphorylation of Tyr323, Thr180 and Tyr182. Cells treated with control or Dlgh1-specific siRNA showed similar phosphorylation of the kinases Erk and Jnk, suggesting that Dlgh1 is required for efficient alternative activation of p38 but not for TCR-induced activation of Erk or Jnk in primary T lymphocytes.

Dlgh1 facilitates NFAT but not NF-κB activation

NFAT and NF-κB are well studied transcription factors that control the expression of a plethora of genes imperative to T cell function. Both transcription factors are activated by TCR and CD28 engagement and can be independently regulated⁹,¹²,¹⁵. Exactly how the TCR specifically activates NFAT versus NF-κB remains unclear. Dlgh1 overexpression facilitates NFAT activation induced by anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (ref. 6). To further understand the function of Dlgh1 in T cell transcription, we examined NF-κB and NFAT activity after manipulating Dlgh1 expression by siRNA-mediated ‘knockdown’ or overexpression. Dlgh1 was overexpressed equally in OT-1 hybridoma T cells expressing NFAT- or NF-κB-responsive reporter constructs (Fig. 3a,b, far right). T cells overexpressing Dlgh1 showed a dose-dependent increase in TCR- and CD28-induced NFAT reporter activity relative to control transfectants (Fig. 3a). Alternatively, Dlgh1 overexpression did not affect NF-κB reporter activity (Fig. 3b). Treatment with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and ionomycin induced even more activation of NF-κB and NFAT, demonstrating the sensitivity of our assay over the range tested (Fig. 3a,b).

To further confirm the selective involvement of Dlgh1 in NFAT but not NF-κB activation, we transfected primary OT-1 T cells with Dlgh1-specific or control siRNA, restimulated the cells with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and assessed degradation of the inhibitor IkBα or phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54. Unlike other residues, whose phosphorylation antagonizes NFAT activity, phosphorylation of Ser54 enhances NFAT transactivation³². Degradation of IkBα releases NF-κB complexes, allowing them to move into the nucleus and transactivate gene transcription. Primary T cells treated with control siRNA showed phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54, degradation of IkBα, phosphorylation of Erk and phosphorylation of p38 at Thr180 and Tyr182 in response to TCR and CD28 crosslinking (Fig. 3c).

However, T cells expressing Dlgh1-specific siRNA showed defective TCR-induced phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54 and p38 at Thr180 and Tyr182, but normal degradation of IkBα and phosphorylation of Erk. A second Dlgh1-specific siRNA that reduced Dlgh1 expression to a similar degree also impaired phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54 (data not shown). These data collectively confirmed the specific effects of Dlgh1 on NFAT activation.

To determine if the functional capacities of NFAT or NF-κB are affected by Dlgh1 ablation, we measured the expression of NFAT and NF-κB target genes (Nfatc1 and Nfkbia, respectively)³³⁻³⁶ in T cells treated with control or Dlgh1-specific siRNA. TCR-induced upregulation of Nfatc1 and Nfkbia was evident in T cells treated with control siRNA, and only Nfatc1 expression was impaired in T cells treated with Dlgh1-specific siRNA (Fig. 3d). Consistent with our previous findings, TCR-induced expression of Ifng, which is known to rely on both NFAT and NF-κB activation, was impaired in T cells treated with Dlgh1-specific siRNA. These data collectively demonstrated that Dlgh1 selectively couples TCR and CD28 engagement to activation of NFAT.

Involvement of p38 in Dlgh1-induced NFAT activation

Because Dlgh1 regulates both p38 and NFAT activity, we next determined whether p38 mediates Dlgh1-induced NFAT activation. We overexpressed Dlgh1 together with an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter in T cells in the presence or absence of p38 inhibitors. Increased overexpression of Dlgh1 resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of TCR-induced NFAT activity (Fig. 4a). However, Dlgh1-induced NFAT activity was abolished when T cells were stimulated in the presence of either of two p38 inhibitors. These results reduced the probability that nonspecific effects of chemical inhibitors contributed to the phenotype noted. In addition, p38 inhibition blocked TCR-induced NFAT activation in cells expressing only endogenous Dlgh1, supporting the idea of involvement of p38 activity in regulating NFAT activation in physiological conditions (Fig. 4b). NF-κB activation was not impaired substantially by treatment with a p38 inhibitor (Fig. 4c). Cyclosporin A, an inhibitor of calcineurin that prevents translocation of NFAT to the nucleus, also blocked Dlgh1-mediated NFAT activation, further confirming the involvement of Dlgh1 in modulating TCR-induced transcriptional activity (Fig. 4d).

To further confirm the involvement of p38 in Dlgh1-induced NFAT activation, we measured TCR-induced phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54 in primary OT-1 T cells incubated with a p38 inhibitor before TCR stimulation. Phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54 was evident 30 min after TCR stimulation, but was blocked by preincubation with a p38 inhibitor (Fig. 4e). These data collectively demonstrated that p38 is required for TCR-induced Dlgh1-mediated NFAT activation in primary T cells and T hybridoma cells.

TCR-induced calcium flux is a well-known modulator of NFAT nuclear translocation. To explore a potential function for Dlgh1 in orchestrating TCR-induced calcium flux, we measured such flux in primary OT-1 T cells loaded with a calcium-sensitive dye and transfected with control or Dlgh1-specific siRNA. T cells expressing control and Dlgh1-specific siRNA constructs had similar calcium flux (Fig. 4f), indicating that Dlgh1 functions downstream of calcium release or in a pathway capable of modulating NFAT activity independently of calcium flux.

Dlgh1-p38 interactions regulate NFAT and p38

Our findings suggested that Dlgh1 functions to regulate NFAT activity through activation of p38. Therefore, mutations abolishing the binding of p38 with Dlgh1 would be predicted to suppress both Dlgh1-induced NFAT activity and p38 activation. To test that hypothesis, we expressed equal amounts of wild-type Dlgh1 or p38 binding-deficient Dlgh1 (PDZ123) protein (Fig. 5a, right) together with an NFAT-responsive luciferase reporter construct in OT-1 hybridoma T cells. Overexpression of wild-type Dlgh1 but not PDZ123 Dlgh1 enhanced TCR and CD28-induced NFAT activity (Fig. 5a, left). In addition, overexpression of PDZ123 but not wild-type Dlgh1 in primary OT-1 T cells impaired TCR-induced phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54 but not phosphorylation of the Akt serine-threonine kinase (Fig. 5b). These data demonstrated a requirement for interactions between p38 and Dlgh1 PDZ domains in TCR-induced NFAT activation.

Data are representative of four independent experiments.

To determine whether the Dlgh1-p38 association is important for p38 activation, we transfected OT-1 hybridoma T cells with equal amounts of wild-type or PDZ123 Dlgh1 expression vectors and measured p38 phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182 in whole-cell lysates. T cells overexpressing wild-type Dlgh1 had substantial amounts of p38 phosphorylated on Thr180 and Tyr182, whereas cells overexpressing PDZ123 Dlgh1 had less (Fig. 5c,d). These data indicated that Dlgh1-p38 interactions facilitate TCR-induced p38 activation.

To determine whether Dlgh1-p38 interactions are functionally relevant, we stimulated primary OT-1 T cell transfectants with antigen-pulsed APCs and measured IFN-γ production. Overexpression of wild-type Dlgh1 promoted IFN-γ production, but preincubation with a p38 inhibitor or overexpression of the p38-binding-deficient mutant PDZ123 Dlgh1 suppressed IFN-γ production (Fig. 5e). These data emphasized the functional importance of Dlgh1-p38 interactions. We have constructed a model of the Dlgh1 Lck, Zap70 and p38 scaffolding activity and the downstream consequences on NFAT activation (Supplementary Fig. 1 online). In our model, MAGUK-driven ‘signalosomes’ coordinate TCR-induced specific activation of NFAT and NFkB.

DISCUSSION

Although TCR-regulated p38 activity is well known to be crucially important in regulating T cell development, activation and autoimmunity, the molecular basis for its activity *in vivo* remains poorly understood. Here we have provided evidence that Dlgh1 selectively directs early TCR tyrosine kinase activity toward activation of a subset of downstream target pathways, facilitating activation of p38 and NFAT but not global tyrosine phosphorylation, calcium flux or activation of Jnk, Erk or NF-κB. In addition, our findings emphasize the importance of alternative MKK-independent p38 activation. In linking alternative p38 activation to NFAT activation and lymphokine production, we ascribe to this p38 signaling pathway relevance to T cell differentiation and activation.

Lck, Zap70 and p38 have been identified as Dlgh1-binding proteins, and nonoverlapping sites of interaction for Lck and p38 have been mapped^{6,21}. The Zap70 association site has not been mapped, but reports characterizing Dlgh1 as a Lck substrate^{21} and identifying Zap70-Dlgh1 interactions induced by CD3 and CD28 stimulation^{6} are consistent with potential involvement of Lck-mediated Dlgh1 phosphorylation in the recruitment and activation of Zap70. In our working model, Dlgh1-mediated juxtaposition of Lck, Zap70 and p38 facilitates Lck-mediated Zap70 activation and coordinated phosphorylation of p38 at Tyr323 and activation of p38. Dlgh1-orchestrated alternative p38 activation leads to NFAT activation. In support of our model, *in vitro* kinase assays of Dlgh1 immunoprecipitates in the presence of a Lck inhibitor showed less Zap70 activation and p38 phosphorylation. In addition, diminishing Dlgh1 expression by siRNA impaired Lck- and Zap70-dependent phosphorylation of p38 at Tyr323 and downstream autophosphorylation of p38 at Thr180 and Tyr182 in primary OT-1 T cells. Inducible phosphorylation of Dlgh1-associated p38 was inhibited by p38 inhibitors in intact cells, further supporting the suggestion that this pool of p38 is activated through the alternative pathway (data not shown). Even in the presence of less Dlgh1-associated p38 phosphorylated at Thr180 and Tyr182, treatment with a p38 inhibitor consistently increased the total quantity of p38 associated with Dlgh1 (data not shown). Those observations led us to hypothesize that Dlgh1 releases p38 once p38 is efficiently activated. Finally, in contrast to wild-type Dlgh1, Dlgh1 point mutants unable to bind p38 failed to facilitate phosphorylation of p38 at Thr180 and Tyr182 in OT-1 T hybridoma cells.

Here we have identified NFAT activation as a specific downstream effector of TCR-induced, Dlgh1-mediated alternative p38 activation. We have demonstrated that diminishing Dlgh1 expression using siRNA or inhibiting p38 activity in primary OT-1 T cells impaired phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54. In addition, reducing Dlgh1 impaired expression of the NFAT-responsive genes *Nfatcl* and *Ifng*. In contrast, calcium mobilization, activation of Jnk, Erk and NF-κB and expression of the NF-κB-responsive gene *Nfkbia* were unaffected. The utility of this siRNA system has been extensively confirmed in OT-1 cells with multiple Dlgh1-specific and control siRNAs^{6}; those studies have demonstrated that Dlgh1 mRNA and protein quantities are specifically diminished, whereas several ‘off-target’ mRNAs and proteins remain unaffected^{6}.

The function of p38 in NFAT activation is controversial and apparently specific to cell type. In non-T cells, p38 activity can negatively regulate NFAT by facilitating NFAT rephosphorylation and nuclear export^{37,38}. However, T cells expressing a transgene encoding a dominant negative p38 molecule show impaired NFAT activity in response to TCR engagement, supporting the idea of a positive regulatory function for alternative p38 activity in NFAT activation in T cells^{39}. That same report has suggested that p38 can stabilize *Nfatcl* mRNA, enhance translation and promote the association of NFATc1 with the cAMP response element-binding protein in T cells. However, it remains unclear whether those pathways are relevant to alternative p38-mediated NFAT activation.

Precisely how Dlgh1-regulated alternative p38 activity affects NFAT activation remains to be determined, although several additional possibilities exist. NFAT is regulated at multiple steps during T cell antigen activation^{14}. The best characterized TCR-regulated NFAT activation pathway involves the calcium-dependent phosphatase calcineurin. As treatment with a Dlgh1-specific siRNA did not affect TCR-induced calcium flux, we propose that Dlgh1 functions downstream of inducers of calcium mobilization or in a distinct NFAT regulatory pathway. Although complexes of Dlgh1 and the signaling protein AKAP have been linked to the recruitment of calcineurin to neuronal post-synaptic AMPA receptors^{40,41}, a function for Dlgh1 as a part of a calcineurin scaffolding complex has not yet been considered.

We have established the involvement of Dlgh1-regulated p38 activity in phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54, which is located in the transactivation domain and whose modification is known to upregulate NFAT activity^{32}. However, it remains unclear if p38 is directly or indirectly responsible for Ser54 phosphorylation. Protein kinase C-ζ (PKC-ζ) has been linked to phosphorylation of the NFAT transactivation domain in T cells^{42}. Furthermore, in other cell types, Dlgh1 and PKC-ζ activity are coordinately regulated and are needed to maintain cell polarity and to inactivate glycogen synthase kinase 3-β, which promotes NFAT nuclear export^{43,44}. Although involvement of Dlgh1 in T cell synaptic polarity has been established^{6,7}, the relationship between cell polarity and NFAT activation remains to be determined and a function for PKC-ζ remains to be considered. Those findings raise the possibility that Dlgh1-regulated PKC-ζ activity might influence NFAT activation through phosphorylation of NFAT at Ser54 and/or inactivation of glycogen synthase kinase 3-β.

Given previous data indicating that Dlgh1 associates with WASP and regulates Lck-WASP interactions and actin polymerization, a model has been proposed whereby Dlgh1 directs Lck-mediated WASP activation^{6}. Supporting that model, T cells lacking Dlgh1 expression showed impaired in *de novo* actin polymerization and synaptic TCR and lipid-raft polarization, but not global protein tyrosine phosphorylation, a phenotype similar to that of WASP-deficient T cells^{6,45}. WASP has also been linked to NFAT activation and *Il2* transcription but not NF-κB activation^{15,46}. Here we have demonstrated that the Dlgh1 SH3 domain is required for Dlgh1-WASP interactions, probably through interaction with WASP proline-rich sequences. Characterization of T cells expressing truncated WASP proteins lacking those proline residues has indicated involvement of a WASP SH3-binding protein in actin polymerization but not NFAT activation^{46}. Whether Dlgh1-WASP interactions facilitate NFAT activity and whether Dlgh1-WASP and Dlgh1-p38 interactions control distinct or intersecting pathways remain to be determined. Experiments establishing potential interdependence of those Dlgh1-mediated events promise to elucidate relationships between synaptic polarization and signal transduction.

Our finding that Dlgh1 specifically regulated p38 and NFAT but not Jnk and NF-κB is in contrast to the published characterization of another MAGUK family member, CARMA1, which couples TCR engagement to NF-κB and Jnk but not p38 or NFAT^{9,23–27}. Engagement of TCR and CD28 promotes recruitment of CARMA1 to membrane lipid-raft microdomains, where it is phosphorylated by PKC-θ and assembles into a complex with the adaptor proteins Bcl-10 and MALT1. That complex is required for downstream NF-κB activation^{47}. Whereas PKC-θ activation also relies on activation of

Lck and Zap70, Dlgh1 seems not to be required for coupling of TCR-proximal kinase activity to NF-κB activation. Based on those findings, we hypothesize that Dlgh1 channels a subset of available Lck and Zap70 specifically toward the alternative p38-NFAT activation pathway. However, an alternate possibility is that small amounts of Dlgh1 are necessary and sufficient for coupling to NF-κB activation, thus explaining the insensitivity of NF-κB to treatment with Dlgh1-specific siRNA or to Dlgh1 overexpression. In either scenario, the greater dependence of NFAT than NF-κB activation on endogenous Dlgh1 quantities ‘predicts’ that independently regulated recruitment of MAGUK proteins Dlgh1 and CARMA1 could serve as a mechanism for regulating TCR signaling specificity. Our findings emphasize the importance of MAGUK family scaffolds in ‘translating’ early TCR signals into specific downstream activities, probably by organizing ‘signalosomes’ in the synapse48. We hypothesize that such MAGUK-driven ‘signalosomes’ represent an organized network of components that, through the use of distinct signaling pathways, act as integration points downstream of the TCR to elicit discrete transcriptional profiles or effector outputs that determine T cell fate and affect functional outcome.

**METHODS**

Dlgh1 ‘knockdown’ and overexpression in primary T cells. ‘Knockdown’ of Dlgh1 expression mediated by siRNA has been described6. Spleen and lymph nodes of OT-1 TCR-transgenic mice were stimulated for 3 d with antigen-pulsed APCs and their cell populations were expanded in IL-2 for 2 additional days, at which point APCs were no longer present. Cells were transfected for 3 h using Transmessenger Transfection Reagent (Qiagen) and 2 μg nonspecific control siRNA (nonsilencing siRNA (1022076); Qiagen) or Dlgh1-specific siRNA (Qiagen) or 2 μg pSPORT-Dlgh1 (Fig. 5b) in serum-free media supplemented with 400 U/ml of IL-2. Cells were then washed and placed in complete media containing 200 U/ml of IL-2 and were assayed 48 h after transfection. All experiments involving mice followed an approved protocol of the University of California at Los Angeles Chancellor’s Animal Research Committee.

Immunoprecipitation, GST precipitation and immunoblot analysis. For immunoprecipitation, lysates were collected and were immunoprecipitated for 4 h or overnight at 4 °C with 2 μg of antibody specific for p38 (clone C20; Santa Cruz, SC535) or Dlgh1 (BD Biosciences, 610875) and 40 μl of 50% (volume/volume) slurry of protein G in PBS. Immunoblotting was performed using antibodies directed against phosphorylated Erk (Thr202/Tyr204 p44/p42 MAPK; Cell Signaling, 9106S), phosphorylated SAPK/JNK (Thr183/Tyr185; Cell Signaling, 9255S), phosphorylated p38 MAPK (Thr180 and Tyr182; clone 3D7; Cell Signaling, 9215S), phosphorylated p38 (Tyr323)19,20, WASP (clone B-9; Santa Cruz, SC13139), phosphorylated NFAT (Ser54; Biosource, 44-944), IkBα (clone C-21; Santa Cruz, SC371), Lck (clone 2102; Santa Cruz, SC13), PLCγ1 (clone 1249; Santa Cruz, SC81), phosphorylated Akt (Ser473; clone 193H12; Cell Signaling, 4058S) or phosphorylated ZAP70 (Tyr319; clone Z34520; BD Biosciences, 612575). For GST precipitation assays, lysates of 4 × 107 stimulated T cells were incubated for 2 h at 4 °C with purified GST alone or with GST–Dlgh1 truncation construct fusion proteins. For measurement of p38 phosphorylation in primary OT-1 T cells, 48 h after transfection, transfected cells were pooled and counted and were placed in fresh media at a density of 3 × 106 cells per ml. Cells were allowed to ‘rest’ for 4 h in 12-well dishes at a volume of 1 ml per well and were transferred to a 12-well plate coated with 5 μg anti-CD3 and 20 μg anti-CD28 (3 × 106 cells per ml per well). Cells (20 × 106) were lysed for 30 min on ice in 700 μl of TNE lysis buffer (Tris, EDTA and 1% (volume/volume) Nonidet-P40). Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000g and 4 °C. Sample buffer (5×) was added to supernatants, followed by boiling for 5 min. Scion Imaging Software was used for all quantifications.

Luciferase assays. OT-1 T hybridoma cells (4 × 107) were placed in 0.5 ml of media and were transfected by electroporation at 240 volts and 960 μFD with pSPORT Dlgh1 plasmid, 1 μg PRLSV40 renilla luciferase and 2.5 μg of plasmid encoding NFAT-responsive49 or NF-κB-responsive luciferase reporter construct. Cells were incubated overnight, were placed in fresh media and were stimulated for 16 h with plate-bound anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Firefly or renilla luciferase activity was assayed with the Dual Luciferase Assay kit (Promega).

Dlgh1 constructs. Dlgh1 truncation constructs were amplified by PCR (primers, Supplementary Table 1 online). All constructs were fully sequenced. The plasmid pSPORT, containing full-length Dlgh1 excluding the insertion 3 (I3) isoform, was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (9767182). Sequences encoding PDZ domains were mutated individually (primers, Supplementary Table 2 online).

Calcium flux. Primary OT-1 lymphocytes (2 × 106) transfected with control or Dlgh1-specific siRNA were incubated for 45 min at 37 °C n 5 μM Indo1AM calcium indicator (Molecular Probes). Cells were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and were immediately analyzed on a FACScan (Becton Dickinson).

Kinase assays. OT-1 T hybridoma cells (20 × 106) treated with control or Dlgh1-specific siRNA were incubated for 30 min on ice with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 and were crosslinked for 30 min at 37 °C with goat anti-hamster. Lysates were collected for 30 min on ice in 1 ml TNE lysis buffer containing protease and phosphatase inhibitors. Lysates were cleared by centrifugation for 10 min at 10,000g and 4 °C. Supernatants were immunoprecipitated for 2 h at 4 °C with 2 μg anti-Dlgh1 or immunoglobulin control with 40 μl of a 50% (volume/volume) slurry of protein G. Beads were washed once with 400 μl kinase buffer (Cell Signaling). Kinase reactions were incubated for 10–30 min at 30 °C in a volume of 50 μl with the addition of 50 μM ATP and inhibitors.

RNA isolation. Transfected T cells (3 × 106) were resuspended in 1 ml TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Chloroform (200 μl) was added, followed by vigorous shaking and centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000g. The top layer was placed in a new tube and 500 μl isopropanol was added, followed by centrifugation for 15 min at 12,000g and 4 °C. The RNA pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol and was dissolved in water treated with diethylpyrocarbonate.

Reverse transcription and quantitative PCR. For quantitative PCR, RNA was quantified and 2 μg RNA was reversed-transcribed using Superscript II (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions with either oligo(dT) or random hexamer as primers. The ICycler thermocycler was used for quantitative PCR analysis according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Bio-Rad). A final volume of 25 μl was used for quantitative PCR, containing the following: Taq polymerase, 1× Taq buffer (Stratagene), 125 μM dNTP, SYBR Green I (Molecular Probes) and fluorescein (Bio-Rad), with oligo(dT) cDNA or random hexamer cDNA as the PCR template. Amplification conditions were 95 °C for 3 min, followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 20 s. Dlgh1 Q-PCR products were normalized relative to L32 ribosomal protein Q-PCR products to correct for potential differences in template input for determination of relative mRNA levels.

PCR. Standard procedures were used for PCR. The following program was used for amplification of Dlgh1 truncations for the generation of GST fusion proteins: 94 °C for 50 s, 59 °C for 45 s and 72 °C for 90 s. The QuikChange kit (Stratagene) was used for site-directed mutagenesis with the following program: 95 °C for 1 min; 18 cycles of 95 °C for 50 s, 60 °C for 50 s and 68 °C for 8 min and 30 s; then 68 °C for 7 min.

Statistical methods. Standard deviation was calculated with the Microsoft Excel program. Statistical significance was obtained with a two-sided t-test assuming equal variances (α = 0.05).
