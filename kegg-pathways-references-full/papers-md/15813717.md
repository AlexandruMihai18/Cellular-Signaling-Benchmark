## SUMMARY

The host and parasite factors that influence susceptibility to Entamoeba histolytica infection and disease are not well understood. Entamoeba histolytica pathogenicity has been considered by focusing principally on parasite rather than host factors. Thus, research has concentrated on explaining the molecular differences between pathogenic E. histolytica and non-pathogenic E. dispar. However, the amoeba molecules considered most important for host tissue destruction (amoebapore, galactose/N-acetyl galactosamine inhibitable lectin, and cysteine proteinases) are present in both pathogenic E. histolytica and non-pathogenic E. dispar. In addition, the genetic differences in pathogenicity among E. histolytica isolates are unlikely to completely explain the different outcomes of infection. Considering that the principal difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic amoebas lies in their surface coats, we propose that pathogenicity of the amoebas is related to the composition and properties of the surface coat components (or pathogen-associated molecular patterns, PAMPs), and the ability of innate immune response to recognize these components and eliminate the parasite. According to this hypothesis, a key feature that may distinguish pathogenic (E. histolytica) from non-pathogenic (E. dispar) strains is whether or not they can overcome innate immune defences. A corollary of this hypothesis is that in susceptible individuals the PAMPs are either not recognized or they are recognized by a set of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that leads to an inflammatory response. In both cases, the result is tissue damage. On the contrary, in resistant individuals the innate inflammatory response, induced through the activation of a different set of TLRs, eliminates the parasite.

## BACKGROUND

### Entamoeba histolytica and Entamoeba dispar are distinct species

Biochemical, immunological, and genetic studies have confirmed that E. histolytica and E. dispar belong to separate species. Although both can infect humans, only E. histolytica is able to invade tissue and cause disease (1,2). The pathogenicity has been related to at least three functions of the amoeba: (i) adherence to host cells, mediated by a galactose and N-acetylgalactosamine-inhibitable lectin, (ii) killing of host cells by a pore-forming peptide known as amoebapore, and (iii) proteolysis of the host's extracellular matrix mediated by cysteine proteinases. However, all the molecules involved in tissue invasion are present in both pathogenic E. histolytica and non-pathogenic E. dispar (1,3–5). A higher expression of the cysteine proteinase in pathogenic amoebae was the only difference found. Therefore, according to Tannich (1,3), ‘it seems reasonable to look for additional clues to explain the fundamental difference between pathogenic and non-pathogenic E. histolytica’ (1,3–5).

amoebas may be related to the composition and properties of the surface coat components (7). In fact, several studies have shown that the cell surface structures of *E. dispar* and *E. histolytica* are different, as *E. histolytica* has a thicker and more uniform surface coat (8–12).

The surface coat contains the amoebic antigens recognized as foreign by both the innate and acquired immune system. The more extensively studied molecules on the surface of the amoebas are the galactose- and *N*-acetylgalactosamine-inhibitable lectin (13, 14), the serine-rich surface protein (15) and the 29-kDa putative surface antigen (16). However, non-pathogenic and pathogenic strains of *Entamoeba* differ principally in the composition and levels of lipophosphoglycan-like (LPGs) and lipophosphopeptidoglycan molecules (LPPGs) (5, 17–21). These are very complex glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked polypeptides of unknown sequence carrying glycan side-chains linked to serine residues via phosphodiester bonds (21–23). In these molecules, which contain mannose, the preferential agglutination of pathogenic amoebas (24, 25) by Con A can be explained, at least in part, by the binding of the latter to the lipophosphoglycan-like antigen (26).

### Genetic differences in susceptibility to Entamoeba histolytica infection

Several findings show that host genes can influence susceptibility to amoebiasis.

#### Species differ in susceptibility to Entamoeba histolytica

*Entamoeba histolytica* trophozoites produce liver abscesses in hamsters and gerbils but not in other species such as mice, rats and guinea pigs, even though larger inoculums are used in the latter animals. In addition, in a natural manner, *E. histolytica* only produces invasive lesions in the intestine of man. These findings suggest that there are genetic differences between susceptible and resistant species.

Although there are several animal models of intestinal and hepatic amoebiasis (27–32), the surgical procedure used to inoculate amoebas can suppress the innate and acquired immune responses (33–35), leading to an increased susceptibility to infection.

#### Gender differences in susceptibility to Entamoeba histolytica

Invasive amoebiasis (dysentery, liver abscess, colonic perforation, peritonitis, appendicitis, and amoeboma) affects predominantly men (36). The high proportion of men with invasive amoebiasis may be due to sex-associated hormones or factors linked to the X-chromosome that might act, at least in part, by means of their effects on innate immunity (37–39).

---

Genetic differences in susceptibility to amoebiasis among individuals from the same species

Since the majority of individuals infected with *E. histolytica* do not develop symptomatic disease, it is likely that genetic factors of the host are responsible for that resistance. Major histocompatibility complex genes (MHC) can affect immunity to *E. histolytica*, as shown by some studies on the associations between MHC class II alleles (HLA DR3) and susceptibility to amoebic liver abscess (40, 41). Recently, an association was observed between protection against intestinal amoebiasis and the HLA class II allele DQB1*0601 or the heterozygous haplotype DQB1*0601/DRB1*1501 (42). In order to explain the association between several HLA class II genes and resistance to *E. histolytica* infection, it was proposed that the presence or absence of a particular HLA class II allele could alter the response to amoebic infection by changing the repertoire of proteins presented to CD4+ T cells (42). However, there is no explanation that links HLA class II genes and innate immunity.

#### Innate immunity may be sufficient for protection against Entamoeba histolytica tissue invasion

We know little about protective immunity to amoebiasis, but apparently both innate and acquired immune responses limit amoebic infection (28, 43, 44). Innate immunity refers to the first-line host defence that serves to limit infection in the early hours after exposure to microorganisms (45). Although the mechanisms of the innate immunity involved in the elimination of *E. histolytica* are poorly understood, some findings show that innate immunity is sufficient for this.

Homosexual men and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals frequently suffer from *E. histolytica* asymptomatic colonizations. However, invasive amoebiasis rarely occurs in these individuals, even in regions with high incidence of amoebiasis (46, 47), with the possible exception of Taiwan (48, 49). It is surprising that HIV infection of CD4+ lymphocytes and macrophages does not impair host defences against *E. histolytica* (50). CD4 T cells play a crucial role in mucosal B cell differentiation and IgA antibody production (51–53). Therefore, HIV-infected individuals and AIDS patients may have reduced levels of antigen-specific IgA (54) as well as low levels of IgA antibodies against *E. histolytica*, the latter of which are associated with immune protection against *E. histolytica* colonization (44, 55). Although acquired immunity is severely impaired in HIV patients, the mechanism of the innate immune system (mucus and antimicrobial substances) could be responsible for the success of those individuals in defending themselves from *E. histolytica* invasion.

The importance of innate immunity in amoebiasis was supported by a model of amoebic liver abscess produced by

i.p. inoculation of *E. histolytica* trophozoites in hamster (56). In this model, the nonspecific stimulation (incomplete Freund's adjuvant, complete Freund's adjuvant, BCG or mineral oil) of peritoneal cells, especially mononuclear inflammatory cells, appears to be sufficient to eliminate the parasite. Therefore, in the absence of T and B cells specific for *E. histolytica* antigens, infected hamsters can mount a protective response against *E. histolytica*.

Recent reports showed that the amoebic infection was more common, severe and prolonged in children with serum anti-lectin IgG (44,55). The production of these IgG antibodies suggests that an inadequate local innate immune response allows for the invasion of the lamina propria, and consequently the production of this isotype of antibodies that are produced when microorganisms, including invasive *E. histolytica*, cross the epithelial surface (57). However, innate immunity was associated with the lack of serum anti-parasite IgG, and the resistance to infection was seen despite the fact that children were infected with genetically diverse strains of *E. histolytica* (44,55). Children who lack serum anti-amoebic IgG probably have a more robust innate immune response that prevents parasite invasion into the intestinal epithelium, thereby preventing a systemic IgG anti-parasite immune response (42). Genetic differences in susceptibility to *E. histolytica* infection may manifest themselves in the ability of the innate immunity mechanisms to control this amoeba (42,44).

### IN SUMMARY

- The amoeba molecules considered most important for host tissue destruction are present in both pathogenic *E. histolytica* and non-pathogenic *E. dispar*.
- *Entamoeba histolytica* and *E. dispar* differ mainly in their cell surface phosphorylated glycolipids.
- Host genes are a critical factor in susceptibility to amoebiasis.
- Natural or nonspecific immunity can avoid invasive amoebiasis in resistant individuals.

### HYPOTHESIS

Based on the aforementioned, we propose a new hypothesis. The pathogenicity of the amoeba depends on the expression of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are not properly recognized by mechanisms of innate immunity. Previously, the pathogenicity of the amoeba was mostly attributed to the parasite-intrinsic mechanisms of pathogenicity. In concordance with our hypothesis, the resistance to *E. histolytica* infection essentially resides in the capacity of the innate immunity of the host to recognize and eliminate the parasite. In susceptible individuals either the receptors

of innate immunity do not recognize PAMPs on the surface of *E. histolytica* or the innate immunity effector mechanisms are incapable of eliminating pathogenic amoebas. However, in these cases, the pathogenic amoebas can be eliminated when the innate immunity is stimulated. Our hypothesis could explain several questions that have been puzzling up to now.

#### Entamoeba histolytica asymptomatic colonization

One such question is why a majority of individuals infected with *E. histolytica* do not develop symptomatic disease (invasive amoebiasis) (44,55,58–63). Two hypotheses have been previously proposed (64); (a) there are multiple strains (polymorphism) of *E. histolytica* that differ in pathogenicity, and (b) there are underlying host factors that make an individual more susceptible to disease. While the polymorphic structure of *E. histolytica* has recently been unveiled (65,66), the host factors that determine the ability of the amoeba to invade and cause symptoms are still undetermined (67). According to our hypothesis, the most relevant host factor is the innate immunity, which either controls the infection and avoids the invasion, leading to asymptomatic colonization, or is unable to recognize and eliminate the parasite, leading to invasive amoebiasis.

#### Polymorphism of *E. histolytica*

A high degree of heterogeneity in pathogenicity has been observed in strains of *E. histolytica*. Pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains differ in the ability to cause invasive disease, and according to several biochemical and molecular criteria (23,68–75). Although the DNA loci for lipophosphoglycan-like and lipophosphopeptidoglycan molecules have not been analysed, the marked differences in the levels of both lipophosphoglycan-like and lipophosphopeptidoglycan molecules between pathogenic and non-pathogenic strains of *E. histolytica* suggest that genetic differences exist in those loci. Polymorphisms in the structure of LPG and LPPG may contribute to polymorphisms in the pathogenicity of *E. histolytica*.

In spite of being infected with genetically distinct strains of *E. histolytica*, possibly with different virulence, an individual can remain asymptomatic. In agreement with our hypothesis, the innate immune mechanisms of such a resistant host recognize LPG and LPPG on different strains of *E. histolytica* and thus avoid tissue invasion, whereas those mechanisms in a susceptible host only recognize LPG and LPPG on *E. dispar* and non-pathogenic strains of *E. histolytica*. The differences in pathogenicity reside in the capacity of the innate immunity to recognize and eliminate the parasite.

Modulation of pathogenicity factor expression by transcription

It has been proposed that the pathogenic forms of *E. histolytica* undergo a kind of non-pathogenic stage (i.e. a stage of commensal parasitism) in the intestinal cavity that may be the reservoir of the pathogen (1). Nevertheless, the mechanisms that trigger amoeba invasion, including the molecules that are involved in tissue destruction, are presently unknown (1,76).

Entamoeba histolytica pathogenicity can be affected by factors in the trophozoite environment, such as calcium and iron levels, temperature, high oxygen pressure, bacteria, collagen binding and inflammation (68, 76–82). Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites might respond to these environmental stimuli by the release of an intracellular signal that alters the activity of DNA transcription factors, such as AP-1, thus inducing the expression of the genes necessary for the synthesis of the molecules involved in pathogenesis (80,83).

LPG and LPPG on *E. histolytica* are molecules that may be involved in tissue destruction, since in one study the loss of pathogenicity of *E. histolytica* in hamsters was correlated with a simultaneous drop in LPG and LPPG levels in a spontaneous mutant (19). The variation in the levels of LPG and LPPG could be explained by the induction or repression of one or a few genes that encode essential enzymes (i.e. GDP-mannose pyrophosphorylase, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase) for the biosynthesis of macromolecular glycoconjugates (84). One of these enzymes, dolichol phosphate mannose synthase, has also been found in *E. histolytica* (85,86), and probably participates in the synthesis of LPG and LPPG in *E. histolytica*.

According to our hypothesis, the structural changes in LPG and LPPG form new PAMPs which are not recognized by the pattern recognition receptors of the innate immunity. In other words, the mechanism that converts a non-pathogenic into a pathogenic strain is related to changes in the surface composition, and thus the ability of the parasite to evade host defence mechanisms.

Influence of bacteria on amoebic virulence

Surface antigens (lipophosphoglycan-proteophosphoglycan) of *E. histolytica* can be modulated in response to bacteria (23, 68, 78). This change may provide an explanation for the observed influence of bacteria on amoebic virulence. Alteration in surface carbohydrates has been associated with changes in pathogenic properties in the protozoan parasite *Leishmania major* and in schistosomes (87,88). In many instances, these changes help the parasite to survive inside the host. According to our hypothesis, bacteria may modify surface antigens and consequently the capacity of the innate immunity to recognize and eliminate the amoeba.

Role of natural immunity in amoebiasis

Toll-like receptors (TLRs) have an essential role in the innate recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and in triggering of innate and adaptive immunity. These receptors activate signal-transduction pathways, which induce the expression of a variety of immune-response genes that promote the inflammatory response as well as the recruitment and activation of macrophages, dendritic cells and antigen-specific lymphocytes (89–91). Peptidoglycan, lipopeptides, and other molecules, including the GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) anchor that fixes many proteins to the surface of protozoan parasites (*Trypanosoma cruzi*) (92), are recognized by Toll-like receptors of type 2 (TLR2) (90,91). Lipophosphoglycan-like and lipophosphopeptidoglycan glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked molecules of *E. histolytica* could behave like a PAMP that is recognized by TLR-2 (93). Recognition of PAMPs on *E. histolytica* by Toll-like receptors could initiate innate/inflammatory responses that either contribute to the invasion and liver damage (94–96) or eliminate the parasite (56), mainly through the activation of macrophages and the production of nitric oxide (97,98). These apparently contradictory observations could be explained by considering that differences in the repertoire of TLRs in susceptible and resistant individuals may elicit different inflammatory and adaptive immune responses. An alternative explanation is that *E. histolytica* elicits the expression of different Toll-like receptors in resistant and susceptible individuals. Recently, it has been reported that Gal-lectin of *E. histolytica* induces strong TLR-2 expression in murine macrophages, which probably modify the expression of innate immune receptors during amoebic infection (96). The enhanced expression and activation of TLR-2 may contribute to the amoebic pathogenesis through the exacerbation of inflammation. In the resistant individual the innate/inflammatory and adaptive immune responses eliminate *E. histolytica*.

An important component of the innate immune system is the complement that constitutes a potentially important mechanism against invasive *E. histolytica*. Thus, to invade successfully, trophozoites must be able to circumvent the action of activated complement proteins. In general, pathogenic strains of *E. histolytica* activate the alternative complement pathway but appear to be resistant to killing by the C5b-9 membrane attack complex (MAC), whereas *E. dispar* and non-pathogenic isolates of *E. histolytica* are generally susceptible to complement-mediated lysis (99,100).

The mechanisms by which pathogenic *E. histolytica* resist the complement attack and evade the action of the terminal components of the cascade are not known. There are several possible mechanisms: (a) a galactose-inhibitable lectin which has antigenic cross-reactivity with CD59, a surface molecule that protects cells from complement attack (101);

(b) synthesizing a CD59-like molecule (102); and (c) incorporating complement regulatory proteins into their membranes (103). Also, it has been proposed (104) that the complex lipophosphoglycoconjugate, a surface molecule linked to amoebic virulence, may serve as a physical barrier to complement components. We suggest that LPGs, PPGs and other molecules that contain mannose residues can be recognized by mannose-binding lectin (MBL). MBL expresses lectin-like specificity for terminal mannose or N-acetylglucosamine residues and recognizes pathogens in the lectin pathway of complement activation. Binding of MBL to pathogens leads to the activation of associated serine proteases, MASP1 and/or MASP2, which in turn act on C4 and C2 to form a C3/C5-convertase (105–107). MBL may bind to the amoeba surface, activate the complement system and potentially kill the parasite. However, LPGs and PPGs are abundant in the pathogenic strains and probably form a protective surface coat that avoids lysis by the alternative and MBL pathways of complement during the invasion of tissue, and thus may play an important role in pathogenesis (5,19,21).

In summary, differences in susceptibility to *E. histolytica* may be related to differences in gene encoding effector molecules of the innate immune system (anti-microbial peptides, the alternative and mannan-binding lectin complement pathways). For example, differences in production of mannan-binding lectin (MBL) could be associated with differences in susceptibility to infection by *E. histolytica*. Individuals with lower production of MBL may be more susceptible to *E. histolytica* infection.

### CONCLUSION

Pathogenicity of *E. histolytica* is related to the composition and properties of the surface coat components (or PAMPs), and the ability of innate immune response to recognize and eliminate the parasite. It is possible that the main genetic differences between resistant and susceptible individuals are in the specificity of the receptors of innate immunity. In susceptible individuals the PAMPs are either not recognized or they are recognized by a set of TLRs that leads to an inflammatory response that contributes to tissue damage. However, in resistant individuals the innate/inflammatory response induced through the recognition of PAMPs is by a different set of TLRs and such response eliminates the parasite.

A non-pathogenic strain of *E. histolytica* may become pathogenic when the expression of genes involved in the synthesis of surface carbohydrates is modified in response to environmental stimuli. These modified surface carbohydrates are either not recognized by innate immune mechanisms, such as complement and macrophages, or are recognized but lead to an inadequate inflammatory response.
