Hu, Xiu-Ti, Yan Dong, Xu-Feng Zhang, and Francis J. White. Dopamine D₂ receptor-activated Ca²⁺ signaling modulates voltage-sensitive sodium currents in rat nucleus accumbens neurons. *J Neurophysiol* 93: 1406–1417, 2005 doi:10.1152/jn.00771.2004. Receptor-mediated dopamine (DA) modulation of neuronal excitability in the nucleus accumbens (NAc) has been shown to be critically involved in drug addiction and a variety of brain diseases. However, the mechanisms underlying the physiological or pathological molecular process of DA modulation remain largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of DA D₂ class receptors (D₂R) enhanced voltage-sensitive sodium currents (VSSCs, $I_{\text{Na}}$) in freshly dissociated NAc neurons via suppressing tonic activity of the cyclic AMP/PKA cascade and facilitating intracellular Ca²⁺ signaling. D₂R-mediated $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement depended on activation of G$_{\text{i/o}}$ proteins and was mimicked by direct inhibition of PKA. Furthermore, increasing free [Ca²⁺]$_{\text{in}}$ by activating inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate receptors (IP₃Rs), blocking Ca²⁺ reuptake, or adding buffered Ca²⁺, all enhanced $I_{\text{Na}}$. Under these circumstances, D₂R-mediated $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement was occluded. In contrast, D₂R-mediated $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement was blocked by inhibition of IP₃Rs, chelation of free Ca²⁺, or inhibition of Ca²⁺/calmodulin-activated calcineurin (CaN), but not by inhibition of phospholipase C (PLC). Although stimulation of muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs) also increased $I_{\text{Na}}$, this action was blocked by PLC inhibitors. Our findings indicate that D₂Rs mediate an enhancement of VSSCs in NAc neurons, in which cytosolic free Ca²⁺ plays a crucial role. Our results also suggest that D₂R-mediated reduction in tonic PKA activity may increase free [Ca²⁺]$_{\text{in}}$, primarily via disinhibition of IP₃Rs. IP₃R activation then facilitates Ca²⁺ signaling and subsequently enhances VSSCs via decreasing PKA-induced phosphorylation and increasing CaN-induced dephosphorylation of Na⁺ channels. This study provides insight into the complex and dynamic role of D₂Rs in the NAc.

## INTRODUCTION

Dysfunction within the mesolimbic dopamine (DA) system has been implicated in a variety of neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, attention deficit hyperactive disorder, and drug addiction. However, the mechanism underlying D₁/D₂ class receptor (D₁R/D₂R) modulation of the activity of DA-targeted nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons has not been fully elucidated. Recent studies reveal that DA regulation of ion channel function and Ca²⁺ signaling plays an important role in modulating the excitability of striatal neurons (see Greengard et al. 1999 for review). For instance, while D₁R stimulation reduces voltage-sensitive Ca²⁺ currents (VSCCs, $I_{\text{Ca}}$) via a protein phosphatase 1 (PP1)-mediated mechanism

increasing $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and inhibiting p-Thr.34-DARPP-32-induced stabilization of the phosphorylation state of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels, respectively. In contrast, suppression of CaN not only disinhibits $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-inactivated AC$_{9,5}$ and p-Thr.34-DARPP-32 (Antoni et al. 1998a; Greengard 2001; Nishi et al. 1997), thereby increasing PKA-induced phosphorylation of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels (Chen et al. 1995), but also abolishes dephosphorylation and expression of IP$_{3}$Rs (Genazzani et al. 1999); this may subsequently decrease $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-modulated $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$. Based on these findings, which suggest that $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$/CaN signaling plays an integrative role in regulating $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channel activity, we hypothesized that D$_{2}$R-mediated $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ enhancement is modulated via facilitated $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$/CaN signaling. The present study was performed to determine whether the D$_{2}$R-mediated increase in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$/CaN signaling enhances $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ and to elucidate the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the D$_{2}$R modulation. Our results suggest that the D$_{2}$R-mediated $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ enhancement in rat NAc neurons should be attributed to increased $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$/CaN signaling, primarily via disinhibition of IP$_{3}$Rs.

### METHODS

#### Animals

Young adult (age of 4–5 wk) male Sprague-Dawley rats were housed in groups in a temperature- and humidity-controlled vivarium under a 12-h light/dark cycle. Food and water were freely available. After ≥3 day acclimation to the vivarium, rats were used for acute experiments regarding modulation of voltage-sensitive sodium currents.

#### Preparation of brain slices

All procedures were performed in strict compliance with the National Research Council Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996) and were approved by our Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Rats were decapitated under halothane anesthesia, and brain tissues containing the NAc were rapidly excised and dissected into blocks. The thickness of brain blocks for cell dissociation was 3–4 mm before slicing.

#### Whole cell voltage-clamp recordings

Medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the NAc were freshly dissociated from slice preparations obtained from rats as described in the preceding text. Brain slices (350 μM) in coronal section were cut while bathed in an ice-cold high-sucrose solution [which contained (in mM) 180 sucrose, 2.5 KCl, 26 NaHCO$_{3}$, 1.2 Na$_{2}$HPO$_{4}$, 25 glucose, 0.1 CaCl$_{2}$, 1 MgCl$_{2}$, and 19 MgSO$_{4}$, pH 7.35, 300–305 mosM/l]. Slices were then incubated for 1–5 h at room temperature (20–22°C) in a NaHCO$_{3}$-buffered saline (Earle’s balanced salts solution, EBSS), bubbled with mixed gas of 95% O$_{2}$-5% CO$_{2}$. Slices were then moved into a low-$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ (100 μM), HEPES-buffered salt solution [which contained (in mM) 140 sodium isethionic acid, 23 glucose, 15 HEPES, 2 KCl, 4 MgCl$_{2}$, and 0.1 CaCl$_{2}$, pH 7.4, 300–305 mosM/l]. With the aid of a dissecting microscope, the NAc (including both core and shell regions) was dissected and placed in an oxygenated stir chamber containing protease (Type XIV; 1–1.5 mg/ml) in HEPES-buffered HBSS at 35°C. After ~30 min of digestion, the tissue was rinsed three times in the low-$\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ HEPES-buffered saline and mechanically dissociated with a graded series of fire-polished Pasteur pipettes in normal external solution (see following text). The cell suspension was then plated into a petri dish mounted on the stage of an inverted microscope containing external bath solution. The dissociated cells were allowed to settle before recording.

Standard whole cell voltage-clamp recording techniques were used as described in our previous study (Zhang et al. 1998). Electrodes were pulled from Corning 7056 glass capillaries (1.65 mm OD, 1.1 mm ID) and fire-polished with a microforge before use. $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ was isolated by different internal (with or without the $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelator EGTA) and external (background) solutions—internal (in mM): 120 CsF, 10 NaCl, 2 Na$_{2}$ATP, 10 HEPES, and 10 EGTA (or replaced by glucose in the cases of EGTA absence), pH 7.3 (with 1 M CsOH), 280–285 mosM/l; and external (in mM): 110 choline chloride, 30 NaCl, 5 CsCl, 1 MgCl$_{2}$, 1 CaCl$_{2}$, 0.4 CdCl$_{2}$, 10 glucose, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3–7.4, 300–305 mosM/l. To determine the effects of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling on modulation of VSSCs, cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ was not chelated in NAc neurons with the absence of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelators in the internal solution (also see following text). In addition, the relatively low concentration of NaCl (30 mM) in the external solution was used to minimize voltage-clamp error. Electrodes filled with internal solution had a resistance of ~2–3 MΩ. The junction potential of –5 mV was measured between the electrode and bath solution and was not compensated. Recordings were obtained with an Axon Instruments 200A patch-clamp amplifier and controlled/monitored with a PC running pCLAMP7 with a 2-kHz filter. The membrane potential was held at –70 mV and was depolarized to –20 mV for activation of VSSCs. Step depolarizing pulses (20 ms) were applied at intervals of 5 or 10 s to allow enough time for voltage-gated $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels to recover from inactivation. After seal rupture, series resistance (<10 MΩ) was compensated (70–80%) and periodically monitored. All currents were leak-subtracted. Adequate voltage control was determined by standard methods (Colatsky and Tsien 1979). Recordings were made from only medium-sized NAc neurons (8- to 14-μm somal diameter) that had none or a few short proximal dendrites. All experiments were performed at room temperature (20–22°C). The initial control levels of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ were recorded and compared between two groups of NAc neurons, either with or without internal EGTA. A time-$I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ response course (6 min) was recorded and compared between NAc neurons with cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ completely chelated by EGTA and cells with free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffered by EGTA at different concentrations (see following text).

#### Drug application

Separate subgroups of neurons were recorded with application of different drugs in different experiments. Drugs acting on D$_{2}$Rs, pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive G$_{\mathrm{i/o}}$ proteins, PKA, PLC, mAChRs, IP$_{3}$Rs, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-ATPase, CaN (PP2B), and free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ buffered by EGTA at different concentrations were used to manipulate the levels of cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ to identify the possible pathway(s) that may be involved in D$_{2}$R-mediated $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ enhancement. For some neurons, drugs were applied in bath solution, either controlled with a DAD-12 superfusion system (ALA Scientific Instruments, Westbury, NY) or controlled manually with a micropipette. For other cells, drugs were applied via internal dialyzing from recording pipettes to the cytosol. After the whole cell configuration was formed, a brief period of time (1–1.5 min) was given to stabilize the basal levels of VSSCs prior to data acquisition. To determine the role of D$_{2}$Rs in $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ modulation of $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$, the selective D$_{2}$R class agonist quinpirole (1–2 μM) and antagonist eticlopride (10 μM) were used. PTX (2.5 μM; 5- to 8-h pretreatment by incubation), a selective inhibitor for G$_{\mathrm{i/o}}$ proteins, was used to determine whether the increase in VSSCs after D$_{2}$R stimulation was coupled to activation of G$_{\mathrm{i/o}}$ proteins. Selective inhibitors for PKA (Rp-cAMPS, 100 μM) and PLC [U-73122, 10 μM and 1-O-octadecyl-2-O-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphorylcholin (ET-18-OCH$_{3}$), 100 μM], as well as a selective agonist (5-methylfurmethide, 5-MFT, 10 μM) and antagonist (atropine, 10–40 μM) for mAChRs, were used to determine whether D$_{2}$R-mediated $I_{\mathrm{Na}}$ enhancement is associated with and modulated via G$_{\mathrm{q}}$/PLC coupling. Internally applied IP$_{3}$ (90 nM) was used to initiate intracellular $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and to increase the cytosolic levels of
free Ca²⁺. Selective inhibitors for IP₃Rs (xestospongin C, 0.5–1 μM, and heparin, 10 μM) were also used to block the effects of IP₃ on $I_{\text{Na}}$. Thapsigargin (275 nM), a selective and irreversible inhibitor for Ca²⁺ ATPase, was used to block reuptake of free Ca²⁺ to the ER. The effects of cytosolic free Ca²⁺, which was buffered by EGTA at different concentrations, on $I_{\text{Na}}$ were studied via direct dialysis from recording pipettes to cytosol. A software platform (WINMAXC) was used to calculate the final free [Ca²⁺]$_{\text{in}}$ buffered by EGTA (Bers et al. 1994). EGTA (10 mM) was used to chelate the resting levels of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ in some control neurons, while concentrations of free Ca²⁺ in those neurons were expressed as 0 nM. EGTA (10 mM) was also used to buffer different concentrations of applied Ca²⁺ in the internal pipette solution to obtain a final free [Ca²⁺]$_{\text{in}}$ at different levels (≤100 μM). Higher concentrations of free Ca²⁺ buffered by EGTA at μM levels were also tested in some cells. In addition, [1,2-bis(o-aminophenoxyethane-N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid tetra(acetoxymethyl)ester] (BAPTA-AM, 50 μM), another Ca²⁺ chelator, was used in some cases for further determining the effects of free Ca²⁺ and D₂R stimulation on $I_{\text{Na}}$. Finally, the CaN inhibitor cyclosporin A (50 μM) and CaN autoinhibitory peptide (CAP, 200 nM) were used to determine the possible effects of CaN in D₂R and Ca²⁺ modulation of VSSCs.

### Statistical analysis

Comparisons of the $I_{\text{Na}}$ density (pA/pF) and their percent changes obtained from different experimental groups were made with either paired or unpaired t-test (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01). χ² test was used to analyze the different responses of $I_{\text{Na}}$ with or without EGTA-induced Ca²⁺ chelation (*P < 0.05 and **P < 0.01). Other comparisons between the time-$I_{\text{Na}}$ curves were made with a two-way ANOVA with repeated measures on one variable ($I_{\text{Na}}$ densities).

### RESULTS

#### Stimulation of D₂Rs enhances $I_{\text{Na}}$ with cytosolic free Ca²⁺ in NAc neurons

Whole cell voltage-clamp techniques were used for recording of $I_{\text{Na}}$ in freshly dissociated NAc neurons. These neurons (with capacitance <10 pF) exhibited DA receptor modulation of VSSCs (Zhang et al. 1998) that was identical to that observed in the dorsal striatum (Cepeda et al. 1995; Schiffmann et al. 1995; Surmeier et al. 1992). Although EGTA was commonly used as a cytosolic free Ca²⁺ chelator in previous investigations elsewhere, it was not always used in our experiments. To determine the physiological effects of the cytosolic free Ca²⁺ on $I_{\text{Na}}$ after D₂R stimulation, different groups of NAc neurons were recorded in the presence or absence of EGTA. First, we evaluated the effects of quinpirole-induced D₂R stimulation on whole cell $I_{\text{Na}}$, either with ($n = 31$ cells) or without ($n = 27$ cells) EGTA in the internal pipette solution. With chelation of Ca²⁺ by EGTA in cytosol, quinpirole suppressed VSSCs in 18 of 31 neurons (58%), but enhanced $I_{\text{Na}}$ in 8 of 31 cells (26%). In contrast, removal of EGTA from cytosol not only markedly decreased the number of cells showing suppressed VSSCs to D₂R stimulation [$n = 2/27$ cells, 7.4%; EGTA(+) vs. EGTA(−): 58 vs. 7.4%, χ² = 16.39, **P < 0.01] but also significantly increased the number of cells showing $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement to quinpirole [$n = 22/27$, 81.5%; EGTA(+) vs. EGTA(−): 26 vs. 81.5%, χ² = 17.91, **P < 0.01] (Fig. 1A1). The remaining cells showed no change in $I_{\text{Na}}$ to quinpirole [EGTA(+) and EGTA(−): $n = 5/31$, 16%, and

$n = 3/27$, 11.1%, respectively]. Presence of an effect on VSSCs was defined as ≥10% in the change of $I_{\text{Na}}$ density. Moreover, the initial (control) levels of $I_{\text{Na}}$ were not significantly affected by removal of EGTA as compared with cells recorded with EGTA [EGTA(+) vs. EGTA(−): 310.3 ± 48.4 vs. 312.3 ± 31.4 pA/pF, $P > 0.05$; Fig. 1A2]. The percent enhancement in $I_{\text{Na}}$ density in response to quinpirole was 27.7 ± 10.9% as compared with controls (327.6 ± 38.7% versus 274.2 ± 78.1 pA/pF, paired t-test, $t = 5.6552$, **$P < 0.01$; Fig. 1B). This effect of quinpirole on $I_{\text{Na}}$ was washed out or blocked by application of the D₂R class antagonist reticulopride (1 μM). In addition, this D₂R-mediated $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement was apparently coupled to activation of G$_{i/o}$ proteins because it was prevented by inactivation of G$_{i/o}$ proteins after incubation of slices with PTX (2.5 μl/ml, 5–8 h; Fig. 1C1). Thus there was no significant difference in peak $I_{\text{Na}}$ between PTX-treated NAc neurons with or without quinpirole (322.6 ± 49 vs. 351.4 ± 57 pA/pF or 100 vs. 107 ± 3%, $n = 6/6$ cells, paired t-test, $P > 0.05$) (Fig. 1, C₂). Because exclusion of EGTA from the cytosol did not significantly affect the initial control levels of $I_{\text{Na}}$, the following experiments were generally performed without the Ca²⁺ chelator.

#### D₂R stimulation-induced $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement is mimicked by inhibition of PKA but not PLC

It is well known that stimulation of D₂Rs is negatively coupled to the cAMP/PKA cascade. Thus if the enhanced $I_{\text{Na}}$ in response to D₂R stimulation is mediated via the cAMP/PKA cascade, blockade of PKA activity should resemble the effects of quinpirole on $I_{\text{Na}}$. In fact, direct inhibition of PKA by internally applied Rp-cAMPs (100 μM) significantly enhanced $I_{\text{Na}}$ (initial control vs. peak: 325.5 ± 42.2 vs. 405.9 ± 43 pA/pF or 100 vs. 129.6 ± 9.2%, $n = 8/8$, paired t-test; $t = 2.5308$, *$P = 0.0392$; Fig. 2, A and B). Under these circumstances, the ability of quinpirole to increase $I_{\text{Na}}$ appeared to be occluded and was no longer observed (Rp-cAMPs/peak vs. Rp-cAMPs ± quinpirole: 405.9 ± 43 vs. 401.9 ± 42.1 pA/pF or 129.6 ± 9.2 vs. 130.1 ± 10.5%, $n = 8/8$ cells, paired t-test, $P > 0.05$; Fig. 2, A and B). In addition, bath applied Rp-cAMPs (100 μM) also increased $I_{\text{Na}}$ ($n = 2/2$ cells; Fig. 2C), further proving the effects of inhibition of PKA on VSSCs. To clarify whether stimulation of D₂Rs also affected the activity of PLC (thereby influencing intracellular IP₃ formation and Ca²⁺ signaling), a variety of agonists and antagonists for PLC were used. In contrast to inhibition of PKA, internally dialyzed U-73122 (10 μM), a PLC inhibitor, did not produce any significant changes in the control levels of $I_{\text{Na}}$ (control vs. U-73122: 295.4 ± 70.3 vs. 254.5 ± 38.5 pA/pF, t-test, $P > 0.05$) and failed to block D₂R stimulation-induced $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement (Fig. 2D). Under this condition, stimulation of D₂Rs by quinpirole was still able to increase $I_{\text{Na}}$ (U-73122 control vs. U-73122 + quinpirole: 287.7 ± 45.1 vs. 254.5 ± 38.5 pA/pF or percent increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$: +12.9 ± 3.7%; $n = 6/6$, paired t-test: $t = 3.4912$, *$P < 0.05$; Fig. 2E). In addition, ET-18-OCH₃ (ET), another PLC inhibitor, was used to confirm the lack of effects of inhibition of PLC on $I_{\text{Na}}$. Internally applied ET (50 μM) failed to block the quinpirole-induced increase of $I_{\text{Na}}$ (ET control vs. ET + quinpirole: 242.3 ± 61.4 vs. 290.5 ± 69.2 pA/pF or percent increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$: +22.7 ± 6.5%; $n = 6/6$

FIG. 1. The modulatory effects of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ on Iₙₐ with D₂ class receptors (D₂R) stimulation in nucleus accumbens (NAc) neurons. A1: with the presence of EGTA, quinpirole (1–2 μM) suppressed voltage-sensitive sodium currents (VSSCs) in the majority of NAc neurons (18 of 31, 58%), but enhanced Iₙₐ in 8 of 31 cells (26%). Removal of EGTA abolished quinpirole-induced suppression in VSSCs (χ² test, **P < 0.01), while Iₙₐ was enhanced in the majority of NAc cells (χ² test, **P < 0.01). The remaining cells showed no changes in Iₙₐ in response to quinpirole. A2: removing EGTA from cytosol did not significantly affect the control levels of VSSCs in NAc neurons [EGTA(+) vs. EGTA(-), P > 0.05]. B1: representative traces indicating that when the cytosolic resting levels of free Ca²⁺ were not interrupted by chelation, stimulation of D₂Rs by quinpirole enhanced Iₙₐ in a NAc neuron recorded. This effect of quinpirole on Iₙₐ was washed out or blocked by eticlopride. B2: the bar graphs showing a significant increase of Iₙₐ in response to quinpirole as compared with the initial control levels of VSSCs (paired t-test, **P < 0.01). C1: inactivation of D₂R-coupled Gᵢ/o by pertussis toxin (PTX, 2.5 μg/l) pretreatment blocked quinpirole-induced Iₙₐ enhancement. C2: there was no significant difference in the Iₙₐ between PTX-treated NAc neurons with or without quinpirole (paired t-test, P > 0.05).

cells, paired t-test: t = 3.6932, *P < 0.02; Fig. 2F). Bath-applied ET (100 μM) also failed to block the effects of quinpirole on Iₙₐ (n = 3/4 cells; Fig. 2G).

To further determine whether PLC played a functional role in mediating Ca²⁺ signaling and VSSCs in NAc neurons, the effects of 5-MFT and atropine on Iₙₐ were studied. Bath application of 5-MFT (10 μM), which stimulated PLC-coupled mAChRs, produced a significant enhancement of Iₙₐ in the majority of neurons recorded (n = 15/21 or 71.4%, 389.4 ± 27.6 vs. 503.4 ± 49.9 pA/pF or percentage increase in Iₙₐ: 30.3 ± 5.2%, paired t-test, t = 5.7877, **P < 0.01; Fig. 3, A and B). This effect of mAChR stimulation on Iₙₐ by 5-MFT was completely blocked by atropine. However, in contrast to its ineffectiveness in blocking quinpirole-induced Iₙₐ increase, internally dialyzed U-73122 completely prevented the effects of 5-MFT on Iₙₐ (Fig. 3C). There was no significant difference in Iₙₐ between the two groups of NAc neurons treated with U-73122 and with combined U73122 plus 5-MFT (n = 5/5, paired t-test, P > 0.05; Fig. 3D).

IP₃ increases Iₙₐ and occludes D₂R stimulation-induced Iₙₐ enhancement

Previous investigations have shown that phosphorylation of IP₃Rs by PKA interrupts function of Ca²⁺-releasing channels and suppresses Ca²⁺ flux (see INTRODUCTION). Therefore D₂R-mediated reduction of PKA activity may result in disinhibition of IP₃Rs from a tonic inhibition of PKA and an increase in intracellular Ca²⁺ release. This may be particularly important for IP₃-induced Ca²⁺ flux after D₂R stimulation in NAc neurons because activation of PLC appears not to be associated with D₂R stimulation (see preceding text). On the other hand, low nanomolar concentrations of IP₃ have been found to induce substantial Ca²⁺ release (Parekh et al. 1997). To assess whether IP₃-induced Ca²⁺ mobilization modulated Iₙₐ in NAc neurons, IP₃ (90 nM) was internally dialyzed into the cytosol from the recording pipette. IP₃ promptly enhanced Iₙₐ in all NAc neurons recorded (n = 10; Fig. 4, A and B). Compared with the initial control levels, the peak Iₙₐ was significantly increased after IP₃ application (318 ± 69 vs. 476 ± 101 pA/pF

**FIG. 2.** Inhibition of PKA, but not phospholipase C (PLC), increases $I_{\text{Na}}$ and occludes the effects of quinpirole on VSSCs. A: representative traces showing that, with free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$, inhibition of PKA by internally applied Rp-cAMPs ($100 \mu \mathrm{M}$) markedly increased $I_{\text{Na}}$ in NAc neurons. Under this condition, quinpirole failed to cause further increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$. B: $I_{\text{Na}}$ was significantly increased from its initial levels after application of Rp-cAMPs (paired t-test, $*P < 0.05$). However, there was no significant difference in the percentage increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$ between cells treated with Rp-cAMPs and cells treated with combined Rp-cAMPs + quinpirole ($P > 0.05$). C: representative traces showing that bath-applied Rp-cAMPs ($100 \mu \mathrm{M}$) was also able to increase $I_{\text{Na}}$, and subsequently, to occlude the effects of quinpirole on enhancing $I_{\text{Na}}$. D: in contrast to inhibition of PKA, inhibition of PLC by U-73122 had no significant effects on $I_{\text{Na}}$ and failed to affect quinpirole-induced $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement. Internal application of U-73122 ($10 \mu \mathrm{M}$) failed to either induce any significant changes in the control levels of $I_{\text{Na}}$ or to block quinpirole-enhanced $I_{\text{Na}}$. E: there was a significant increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$ after concurrent application of U-73122 and quinpirole as compared with U-73122 alone (paired t-test, $*P < 0.05$). F: inhibition of PLC by internal application of ET-18-OCH₃ (ET, $50 \mu \mathrm{M}$) failed to block quinpirole-induced $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement. Inset: quinpirole was still able to induce a significant increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$ (paired t-test, $*P < 0.05$). G: externally applied ET ($100 \mu \mathrm{M}$) also failed to block quinpirole-increased $I_{\text{Na}}$ after $D_2R$ stimulation ($n = 3/4$ cells).

There was no significant difference in the percent increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$ between cells treated with IP₃ and those treated with combined IP₃ plus quinpirole ($P > 0.05$; Fig. 4C). Prolonging the perfusion time of IP₃ did not produce a further increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$ but usually reduced $I_{\text{Na}}$ from its peak levels (data not shown), suggesting a negative feedback mechanism might be initiated (see DISCUSSION). IP₃-induced $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement was completely blocked by xestospongin C ($0.5–1 \mu \mathrm{M}$), a selective IP₃R inhibitor (Gafni et al. 1997) [IP₃ (peak) vs. IP₃ + xestospongin C: $476 \pm 101$ vs. $242 \pm 47 \mathrm{pA/pF}$ or $149.4 \pm$

There was no significant difference in $I_{\text{Na}}$ among NAc neurons recorded at the control levels (IP₃ initial) and that with combined IP₃ plus xestospongin C ($318 + 69$ vs. $242 \pm 47 \mathrm{pA/pF}, 100$ vs. $106 \pm 10\%, P > 0.05$; Fig. 4C). In addition, internally dialyzed heparin ($2.5 \mathrm{mg/ml}, 5–8$ min), another IP₃R inhibitor, also prevented quinpirole-induced $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement ($n = 6/6$ cells; Fig. 4D).

In addition, the IP₃-produced increase in Iₙₐ was completely blocked by the IP₃R inhibitor xestospongin C (paired t-test, #P < 0.02). D: moreover, internally dialyzed heparin (2.5 mg/ml), another selective IP₃R inhibitor, also prevented quinpirole-induced Iₙₐ enhancement (n = 6/6 cells).

Application of thapsigargin (275 nM), an irreversible Ca²⁺ ATPase blocker, produced a significant increase in \( I_{\text{Na}} \) as compared with the initial control levels (control vs. thapsigargin: 332.7 ± 35.9 vs. 387.4 ± 47.6 pA/pF or 100 vs. 115.8 ± 5.6%, \( n = 7/7 \), paired t-test, \( t = 2.5215 \), *P < 0.05; Fig. 5, A and B). In addition, the effects of D₂R stimulation by quinpirole on enhancing VSSCs were occluded after thapsigargin application (Fig. 5C). There was no significant difference in \( I_{\text{Na}} \) between neurons treated with thapsigargin alone and cells treated with combined thapsigargin and quinpirole (346.9 ± 101 vs. 339.1 ± 111 pA/pF, \( n = 6 \) cells, paired t-test, \( P > 0.05 \)).

Elevating cytosolic free \([Ca^{2+}]_{\text{in}}\) increases \( I_{\text{Na}} \) and occludes \( D_2R \) stimulation-induced \( I_{\text{Na}} \) enhancement

It has been proposed that free Ca²⁺, even in the presence of resting levels of IP₃, is the actual messenger that opens the IP₃R (Taylor and Marshall 1992). In addition, Ca²⁺ is also the only known physiological inhibitor of IP₃Rs. Excessive increases in \([Ca^{2+}]_{\text{in}}\) (>300 nM) decrease the binding of IP₃, suppress activity of IP₃R-gated channels, and inhibit Ca²⁺ release (Ehrlich et al. 1994). Although stimulation of D₂Rs leads to an increase in \([Ca^{2+}]_{\text{in}}\), whether the increased Ca²⁺ signaling is able to modulate VSSCs is unknown. In this study, different concentrations of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ (12 nM to 100 μM) were buffered with EGTA (see METHODS) and were dialyzed into the cytosol of NAc neurons. The \( I_{\text{Na}} \) recorded with complete chelation of cytosolic free Ca²⁺ (0 nM) by EGTA (10 mM) during a 6-min period of recording time was used as control. A 6- to 7-min recording time period was chosen to avoid possible current deterioration, which could occur in some whole cell patched cells with application of high concentration of free Ca²⁺ and longer time periods of recording. There was no significant difference in the \( I_{\text{Na}} \) recorded during this period of time (\( n = 7 \) cells, 1-way ANOVA, \( F(7,30) = 0.7517 \), \( P > 0.05 \); Fig. 6C, ●). However, when the free \([Ca^{2+}]_{\text{in}}\) was buffered with EGTA to 12 nM, a rapid and robust increase in \( I_{\text{Na}} \) was observed (Fig. 6, A and C, ○). The enhanced \( I_{\text{Na}} \) achieved its peak levels within 2–3 min followed by a plateau that lasted 2–3 min. In the presence of free Ca²⁺ (12 nM), the peak \( I_{\text{Na}} \) levels were significantly greater than its initial controls (\( n = 4 \), initial vs. peak: 390.8 ± 68.4 vs. 929.5 ± 124.1 pA/pF or 100 ± 17.5 vs. 244.4 ± 21.3%, paired t-test, \( t = 6.1543 \), **\( P < 0.01 \); Fig. 6B). Under these circumstances, quinpirole-induced \( I_{\text{Na}} \) enhancement was occluded (Fig. 6A). There was no significant difference in the peak \( I_{\text{Na}} \) recorded from NAc neurons with application of 12 nM free Ca²⁺ and that with combined free Ca²⁺ and quinpirole (\( n = 4/4 \), 929.5 ± 124.1 pA/pF vs. 986.7 ± 127.4 pA/pF or 244.4 ± 21.3 vs. 257.4 ± 23.6%, paired t-test, \( P > 0.05 \); Fig. 6B).

Moreover, there was also a significant difference in the time-response curves between neurons with completely-chelated Ca²⁺ by EGTA (0 nM) and cells with free Ca²⁺ buffered by EGTA at 12 nM [● vs. ○, \( n = 7 \) vs. 4 cells, MANOVA, \( F(1,6) = 30.89 \), \( P < 0.001 \), post hoc Newman-Keuls test: **\( P < 0.01 \); Fig. 6C]. \( I_{\text{Na}} \) was also significantly enhanced by EGTA-buffered free Ca²⁺ at higher concentration [164 nM; ● vs. △, \( n = 7 \) vs. 7 cells, MANOVA, \( F(1,6) = 14.31 \), \( P < 0.03 \), post hoc Newman-Keuls test: **\( P < 0.01 \); Fig. 6C], although it appeared to be less potent than that induced by 12 nM. Further elevating EGTA-buffered \([Ca^{2+}]_{\text{in}}\) to the micromolar levels (1–100 μM, \( n = 13 \) cells) failed to produce further increase in VSSCs but rather caused a remarkable reduction in \( I_{\text{Na}} \) as compared with that induced by 12 nM [□ vs. ○: \( n = 13 \) vs. 7 cells, MONOVA, \( F(1,6) = 20.53 \), \( P < 0.001 \), post hoc Newman-Keuls test: **\( P < 0.01 \)] and 164 nM [□ vs. △: \( n = 13 \) vs. 7 cells, MONOVA, \( F(1,6) = 10.92 \), \( P < 0.01 \), post hoc Newman-Keuls test: **\( P < 0.01 \); Fig. 6C]. Under this condition, there was no significant difference between the reduced and the control levels of \( I_{\text{Na}} \) [□ vs. ●: \( n = 13 \) vs. 7 cells, MONOVA, \( F(1,6) = 0.3764 \), \( P > 0.05 \)].

Inhibition of CaN eliminates the effects of both free Ca²⁺ and \( D_2R \) stimulation on \( I_{\text{Na}} \) enhancement

Ca²⁺/calmodulin-dependent CaN has been reported to increase \( I_{\text{Na}} \) via dephosphorylation of Na⁺ channels (see INTRODUCTION). In our study, experiments were performed to determine whether D₂R-mediated \( I_{\text{Na}} \) enhancement was modulated by increase of \([Ca^{2+}]_{\text{in}}\), and subsequently a facilitated Ca²⁺/CaN signaling. The CaN inhibitors cyclosporin A and CaN autoinhibitory peptide (CAP) were used to determine whether higher concentration of free Ca²⁺ and D₂R stimulation-induced \( I_{\text{Na}} \) enhancement could be blocked via inhibition of CaN

D₂R AND Ca²⁺ MODULATION OF Iₙₐ

activity. Increase in Iₙₐ induced by free Ca²⁺ (buffered by EGTA at 12 nM) was abolished after application of cyclosporin A (50 μM, *n* = 7 cells; Fig. 7A). When Iₙₐ was suppressed and returned to the control levels, quinpirole also lost its ability to enhance Iₙₐ (*n* = 4/4 cells; Fig. 7A). This effect of cyclosporin A on free Ca²⁺-modulated Iₙₐ enhancement was reversible and washed out with fresh medium. Under this condition, the ability of free Ca²⁺ (12 nM) to increase Iₙₐ was completely restored (Fig. 7A). The bar graph shows that the significant increase of Iₙₐ after application of free Ca²⁺ (12 nM) was blocked by cyclosporin A [*n* = 7/7 cells, MANOVA, *F*(1,6) = 12.29, *P* < 0.01, post hoc Newman-Keuls test: \**P* < 0.05, \*\**P* < 0.01; Fig. 7B]. In addition, cyclosporin A also produced a moderate decrease in the control levels of Iₙₐ (*n* = 3/4 cells; Fig. 7C), unmasking a tonic activity of endogenous CaN in modulating the function of Na⁺ channels. Similar to cyclosporin A, internally dialyzed CAP (200 nM, 6–8 min) abolished the ability of quinpirole to enhance Iₙₐ (*n* = 3/3 cells; Fig. 7D). A summary of the possible mechanism underlying D₂R-mediated facilitation of Ca²⁺/CaN signaling that modulates Iₙₐ enhancement in NAc neurons is illustrated in Fig. 8.

## DISCUSSION

The present study has demonstrated that when cytosolic free Ca²⁺ was not interrupted by chelation, stimulation of D₂Rs enhanced VSSCs in freshly dissociated medium spiny NAc neurons of rats. Our findings also indicate that the D₂R-mediated Iₙₐ enhancement was associated with activation of Gᵢ/o proteins and modulated by facilitated Ca²⁺/CaN signaling via a mechanism in which disinhibition of IP₃Rs from a tonic suppression by PKA, rather than activation of D₂R-associated Gq/PLC coupling, was primarily involved. It is well established that activation of PKA after D1R stimulation results in phosphorylation of Na⁺ channels, leading to decrease of Iₙₐ in striatal MSNs (Cantrell et al. 1997; Catterall 1997; Li et al. 1992, 1993; Zhang et al. 1998). In contrast, inhibition of PKA activity by D₂R stimulation is associated with increased free [Ca²⁺]ₐ, decreased phosphorylation of Na⁺ channels, and enhanced Iₙₐ in striatal MSNs (Greengard et al. 1998, 1999; Nishi et al. 1997). Results from the present study are consistent with those previous findings. Moreover, they also suggest that the previously unidentified mechanism that dynamically controls and regulates the D₂R-mediated increase in [Ca²⁺]ₐ (Greengard et al. 1999) may be related, at least partially, to the decreased phosphorylation of IP₃Rs by PKA (see INTRODUCTION), and increased dephosphorylation of the Ca²⁺-releasing channel by CaN (Cameron et al. 1995, 1997).

Another important and novel finding in this study is that, similar to D₂R stimulation, elevating free [Ca²⁺]ₐ via Ca²⁺ mobilization without activation of VSCCs also enhances Iₙₐ in NAc neurons. First of all, intracellularly applied IP₃ rapidly enhanced Iₙₐ, whereas this effect of IP₃ on Iₙₐ was reversed by xestospongin C and heparin through inhibition of IP₃Rs. Second, the facilitatory effects of IP₃ on Iₙₐ were mimicked by thapsigargin, which irreversibly blocks free Ca²⁺ reuptake and thereby increasing free [Ca²⁺]ₐ (Inesi and Sagara 1992, 1994; Sabala et al. 1993). Third, elevating free [Ca²⁺]ₐ buffered by EGTA also induced robust enhancement in Iₙₐ. More impor-

tantly, under these circumstances, the effects of $D_{2}R$ stimulation on $I_{Na}$ enhancement were occluded, suggesting that the facilitatory action of $D_{2}R$ stimulation on $I_{Na}$ was replaced by enhanced $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ signaling. In addition, our findings reveal that the $I_{Na}$ enhancement, which was associated with increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$, was concentration-dependent and probably regulated by a negative feedback mechanism. As mentioned in the preceding text, to clarify the physiological effects of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ on modulation of $I_{Na}$, $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ chelators were excluded in some experiments. This “unconventional” way of voltage-clamp recording did not affect the basal levels of VSSCs in NAc neurons because no significant difference in the initial control levels of $I_{Na}$ were observed between cells recorded with or without chelation of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ by EGTA. In contrast, elevating $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ significantly increased $I_{Na}$, indicating that free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ functionally modulated enhancement of $I_{Na}$. These results are consistent with previous findings that suggest that the physiological resting levels of free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ may be below the nanomolar (nM) levels, and elevating $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ increases the activity of IP$_{3}$R and $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ flux (Ehrlich et al. 1994). It is unclear why $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-induced $I_{Na}$ enhancement at higher $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ (164 nM) appeared to be less potent than lower $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ (12 nM) because neither of them apparently exceeds a threshold level (300 nM) (Ehrlich et al. 1994). It is possible, however, that the actual $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ might be significantly higher than the applied $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentrations because $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release could be facilitated by increased cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$.

The failure to produce greater elevations in $I_{Na}$ in response to high concentration (micromolar levels) of free $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ suggests that a negative feedback mechanism that suppressed $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release might have been initiated as a result of excessive increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }} (>300 \mathrm{nM})$. Under these circumstances, many IP$_{3}$Rs are inactivated though others may still stay open (Bezprozvanny et al. 1991; Ehrlich et al. 1994; Hagar et al. 1998). The “up-down” activity of IP$_{3}$Rs in response to increased $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ has been displayed as a normal distribution in a bell-shaped $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$-dependence activation curve (Hagar et al. 1998), indicating that excessive increases in $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ have turned free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ from a physiological activator to an inhibitor of $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ release. Our results are in agreement with these findings, suggesting that the reduced $I_{Na}$ after application of high $\left[\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}\right]_{\text {in }}$ was functionally modulated by such negative feedback mechanism. On the other hand, excessive free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ would also disrupt the activity of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels, causing a significant reduction in the amplitude of single-channel $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ currents by directly binding within the pore and occluding the conductance pathway of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ channels (Zamponi and French 1995).

FIG. 7. Inhibition of CaN blocks the ability of cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ and $D_{2}R$ stimulation to enhance $I_{Na}$. $A$: the $I_{Na}$ enhancement induced by EGTA-buffered free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ was blocked by the CaN inhibitor cyclosporin A. Under these circumstances, the ability of $D_{2}R$ stimulation by quinpirole ($1 \mu \mathrm{M}$) to enhance $I_{Na}$ was abolished. The facilitatory effects of EGTA-buffered free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ on $I_{Na}$ were then restored after washout of this CaN inhibitor. $B$: EGTA-buffered free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$ produced a significant increase in whole cell $I_{Na}$, that was completely blocked by cyclosporin A (*$P < 0.05$, **$P < 0.01$). $C$: cyclosporin A decreased the control levels of $I_{Na}$ in NAc neurons with cytosolic free $\mathrm{Ca}^{2+}$. $D$: internal application of CaN autoinhibitory peptide (CAP), another inhibitor of CaN, also abolished the ability of quinpirole to enhance $I_{Na}$.

D₂R AND Ca²⁺ MODULATION OF Iₙₐ

FIG. 8. The D₂R/Gᵢₒ/AC/cAMP/PKA/IP₃R/Ca²⁺/CaN pathway for modulation of Iₙₐ in rat NAc neurons. Based on the results from the present study and the previous findings from other investigations, we propose here that D₂R-mediated Iₙₐ enhancement in medium spiny NAc neurons of rats is modulated via inhibition of PKA and disinhibition of the Ca²⁺/CaN signaling. Increased cytosolic free [Ca²⁺]ₐ and activated CaN play a critical role in the facilitated Ca²⁺ signaling after D₂R stimulation. These findings also suggest that the D₂R-mediated increase in Iₙₐ should be primarily attributed to disinhibition of IP₃Rs. Because stimulation of D₁Rs leads to activation of PKA, phosphorylation of Na⁺ channels and reduction in VSSCs, the D₂R/Ca²⁺-mediated Iₙₐ enhancement would play an important role in balancing the physiological effects of DA on ion channel function and the membrane excitability of NAc neurons. Increased Iₙₐ should also contribute to excitatory responsiveness through which the output of information from the NAc to other brain regions would be enhanced. The numbers indicate the experimental steps that have been taken in determining the D₂R/Ca²⁺-modulated Iₙₐ enhancement in NAc neurons. The upward “open” arrows in the NAc neuron indicate an increase in free Ca²⁺ levels or Iₙₐ, and the downward arrows indicate a reduction in Iₙₐ. The sign of (−) indicates inhibition and (+) indicates stimulation/activation.

Our findings also suggest that facilitated Ca²⁺ signaling may modulate Iₙₐ via inhibition of Ca²⁺-inactivated AC and activation of CaN. It is well established that AC can be subclassified into nine different isoforms, and the type IX and V Ca²⁺-inactivated ACs (AC₉,₅) are predominant in the caudate putamen and NAc (Antoni et al. 1998a; Glatt and Snyder 1993; Paterson et al. 1995; Premont et al. 1996; Xia et al. 1992). Therefore elevating [Ca²⁺]ₐ may diminish the tonic action of AC₉,₅ and PKA, particularly PKA-induced phosphorylation, on Na⁺ channels and IP₃Rs. On the other hand, increased [Ca²⁺]ₐ would activate CaN (Snyder-Keller and Keller 1998), thereby enhancing dephosphorylation of Na⁺ channels and IP₃Rs. Importantly, activated CaN also diminishes the activity of Ca²⁺-inactivated AC (Antoni et al. 1998a,b) and inhibits PKA-activated p-Thr.34-DARPP-32 (Greengard et al. 1999). All these actions contribute to an increase in whole cell VSSCs. Moreover, we found that inhibition of CaN not only eliminated both free Ca²⁺- and quinpirole-induced Iₙₐ enhancement but also reduced the basal levels of VSSCs. These findings suggest that CaN functions dynamically in a final common path in which the D₂R-mediated Iₙₐ enhancement is modulated by facilitated Ca²⁺ signaling.

Although previous (see INTRODUCTION) and the present findings suggest that the D₂R-mediated increase in [Ca²⁺]ₐ is likely modulated via disinhibition of IP₃Rs from a tonic phosphorylation of PKA, a recent study reports that IP₃ formation can be promoted through a D₂R/Gq/PLCβ₁ coupling in striatal neurons (Hernandez-Lopez et al. 2000). This finding seems to contradict others showing that D₂Rs are either not coupled to IP₃ formation (Gupta and Mishra 1990; Kelly et al. 1988; Rubinstein and Hitzemann 1990), or actually function in an inhibitory manner (Pizzi et al. 1987, 1988), in the rat striatum. These findings give rise to a question: should the D₂R-mediated increase in [Ca²⁺]ₐ (and subsequently enhanced Iₙₐ) be primarily attributed to an increase in IP₃ formation via activation of the D₂R/Gq/PLC coupling or to disinhibition of IP₃Rs

5-min period of action time but is inhibited at much greater levels after a longer period (20 min) of F⁻ treatment. Taken together, these results suggest that, during a relative short period of recording time, fluoride-induced inhibition in PKA activity may not have a significant impact in D₂R/Ca²⁺-modulated $I_{\text{Na}}$ enhancement.

The NAc is a structure in which functionally distinct ensembles of neurons are recruited by convergent DAergic and other inputs to coordinate patterns of movement and affective behavior (Pennartz et al. 1994). Through modulating the function of membrane ion channels, DA participates in control and regulation of the excitability of NAc neurons. Given that DA dynamically modulates the activity of NAc neurons via regulating the function of membrane ion channels, including but not limited to suppression of $I_{\text{Na}}$ and $I_{\text{Ca}}$ though D₁R-mediated signaling (Fienberg et al. 1998; Hu et al. 2004; Schiffmann et al. 1995, 1998; Zhang et al. 1998, 2002), the D₂R-mediated increase in Ca²⁺ signaling and $I_{\text{Na}}$ would provide a physiological balance in modulation of the membrane excitability. An increase in $I_{\text{Na}}$ also contributes to regulation of excitatory responsiveness through which the output of information from the NAc to other brain regions is enhanced. Determination of this function of D₂Rs is significant and will be helpful for further understanding of the mechanisms related to not only the normal physiological processing but also neurodegenerative diseases, sensitization, self-administration, and withdrawal effects of psychostimulants after chronic exposure.

In summary, our study has demonstrated that D₂R-stimulation enhances whole cell VSSCs in freshly dissociated medium spiny NAc neurons. The incased $I_{\text{Na}}$ is modulated by facilitated Ca²⁺/CaN signaling, most likely via disinhibition of IP₃Rs. Our findings also suggest that CaN plays an critical role in integrating intracellular signals initiated by D₂R stimulation and that activation of the D₂R/Gᵢ/o/AC/PKA/IP₃R/Ca²⁺/CaN pathway may decrease phosphorylation and increase dephosphorylation of both IP₃Rs and voltage-sensitive Na⁺ channels, thereby increasing VSSCs in NAc neurons.
