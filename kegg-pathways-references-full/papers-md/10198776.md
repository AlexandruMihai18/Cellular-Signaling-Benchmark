## HEPATIC CHOLESTEROL HOMEOSTASIS

The liver plays a central role in the regulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Under normal conditions, cholesterol input into the body equals output; cholesterol homeostasis is maintained. Under pathologic conditions, enhancement of cholesterol input into the liver or a reduction in hepatic cholesterol output may overwhelm cholesterol homeostatic mechanisms and potentially result in hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, or cholesterol cholelithiasis. An improved understanding of the mechanisms by which the liver maintains total body cholesterol homeostasis may lead to therapeutic maneuvers to reverse hypercholesterolemia and the supersaturation of bile with cholesterol, the two underlying conditions contributing to atherosclerosis and cholesterol gallstones.

The two major hepatic cholesterol input pathways are composed of receptor-mediated endocytosis of cholesterol-laden lipoproteins and de novo cholesterol biosynthesis (Fig. 1). Hepatic uptake of preformed cholesterol from sinusoidal blood is mediated by receptors for chylomicrons, which contain cholesterol from the diet, as well as low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) SR-B1.

#### Figure 1. Cholesterol Homeostasis

**Input and output pathways of cholesterol in the liver are shown. The input pathways consist of de novo biosynthesis of cholesterol from acetate and the uptake of preformed cholesterol by way of several receptor-mediated mechanisms. The output pathways consist of the conversion of cholesterol to bile acids (neutral and acidic pathways) and biliary cholesterol secretion. Primary and secondary bile acids feedback inhibit cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A) and sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27), the two enzymes that initiate bile acid biosynthesis from cholesterol. LDL = low density lipoprotein; HDL = high density lipoprotein.**

scavenger receptors.⁵⁷ After internalization by the hepatocyte, cholesterol is shuttled to intracellular compartments by poorly understood transport pathways.⁶⁵ The liver is also quantitatively the most important organ for cholesterol synthesis from acetate, which takes place in a cascade of more than 25 enzymatic steps. The genes encoding microsomal 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA-R), the rate-determining enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, as well as other enzymes in the pathway and the LDL receptor are coordinately repressed by cholesterol and oxidation products of cholesterol by well-described feedback inhibition.³⁸

Free (unesterified) cholesterol serves as the substrate for the two output pathways of cholesterol, bile acid biosynthesis and biliary cholesterol secretion, whereas esterified cholesterol represents a metabolically inactive storage form.¹³¹ The exchange between free and esterified forms is catalyzed by acyl CoA–cholesterol ester transferase (ACAT), which esterifies free cholesterol to fatty acids, and cholesteryl ester hydrolase (CEH), which hydrolyzes the ester linkage. The activities of ACAT and CEH are probably coordinately regulated with the input and output pathways; the extent of their regulation, however, has not been adequately studied.

The liver houses the only mechanisms for disposing of abundant cholesterol from the body. In humans, approximately 50% of cholesterol excretion occurs via conversion to bile acids, whereas the remainder is directly secreted into biliary canaliculi by poorly understood mechanisms (see Fig. 1). In addition to providing a route of cholesterol excretion from the body, bile acids are natural ionic detergents that play critical roles in the absorption, transport, and secretion of biliary and dietary lipids; they are absolutely required for the absorption of dietary cholesterol and fat-soluble vitamins from the intestine.¹²⁹ This article summarizes progress in understanding of the regulation of bile acid biosynthesis and discusses the role of these pathways in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis.

## BILE ACID BIOSYNTHETIC PATHWAYS

The biotransformation of cholesterol to primary bile acids occurs exclusively in hepatocytes via a cascade of at least 15 enzymatic reactions requiring the participation of four different organelles⁸,¹⁵,⁵⁰,⁸⁹,⁹⁷,¹³⁴; the transport of potentially toxic bile acid intermediates between organelles probably involves sterol carrier proteins.⁵⁹ The modifications of cholesterol in its conversion to cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids include (1) addition of hydroxyl groups to specific positions on the sterol nucleus, (2) saturation of the steroid nucleus and epimerization of the 3β-hydroxyl group, and (3) side-chain oxidation and shortening (cleavage) by three carbons. These modifications convert water-insoluble cholesterol into water-soluble bile acids. According to classic teaching, the biotransformation of the sterol nucleus occurs before side-chain modifications and begins with hydroxylation of cholesterol at the 7α position by

cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A), the rate-determining enzyme in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway.¹⁵,⁸⁹,¹³⁴ This pathway has come to be known as the *neutral* pathway of bile acid biosynthesis because bile acid precursors proceed through most of the pathway as neutral steroids (Fig. 2). An

![Figure 2](#fig2)

**Figure 2. Neutral pathway of bile acid biosynthesis (left).** Cholesterol is converted to 7α-hydroxycholesterol by microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP 7A) (reaction 1) to form 7α-hydroxycholesterol. 7α-hydroxycholesterol is converted by the microsomal 3β-hydroxy-Δ⁴C₂₇-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (reaction 2). The product of this reaction is 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, which can be hydroxylated at C12α-hydroxylase (CYP 12) (reaction 3), producing a precursor of cholic acid, or reduced by cytosolic Δ⁴-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (reactions 4 and 5), producing a precursor of chenodeoxycholic acid. The latter two enzymes also reduce 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one into 5β-cholestane 3α,7α12α Triol. At this point, side-chain oxidation of bile acid intermediate takes place (see Figure 3). **Acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis (right).** The first step in this pathway is the movement of cholesterol to mitochondria (reaction I), followed by 27-hydroxylation to form 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acid (reaction II) by sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP 27). Both products can be hydroxylated at C7 position by oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP 7B1) (reaction III). 3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3β-HSDH/ISO) initiates sterol nuclear modifications similar to those in the neutral pathway (reaction IV). Cholic acid production by way of the acidic pathway is small, and intermediates for 12α-hydroxylation have not been identified.

---

alternative bile acid biosynthetic pathway has been described, in which side-chain modifications (including oxidation to an acid) occur before modifications of the sterol nucleus. This alternative pathway has been dubbed the *acidic* pathway because bile acid precursors proceed through the cascade of intermediates as carboxylic acids (see Fig. 2). These pathways are discussed separately because they involve enzymes with different substrate specificities and may be regulated differently under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions.

## Classic or Neutral Pathway of Bile Acid Synthesis

In humans, the neutral pathway results in the synthesis of an approximately 1:1 ratio of chenodeoxycholic and cholic acids, the two primary bile acids in most species. The first, rate-limiting, and most extensively regulated step in the neutral pathway is the 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol, catalyzed by microsomal cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7A): (reaction 1, Fig. 2). This reaction occurs exclusively in the liver because the CYP7A gene is exclusively expressed in hepatocytes. After the 7α-hydroxylation of cholesterol, the 3β-hydroxyl group of 7α-hydroxycholesterol is oxidized, allowing a shift in double bond position in the sterol nucleus, to form 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (reaction 2) by microsomal 3β-hydroxy-Δ⁵-C₂₇-steroid dehydrogenase/isomerase (3β-HSDH/ISO), which catalyzes both reactions. 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one either can be hydroxylated at the C-12 position by microsomal cytochrome P-450 sterol 12α-hydroxylase to form 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (reaction 3), a cholic acid precursor, or can be sequentially reduced by cytosolic Δ⁴-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase and 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to 5β-cholestane-3α,7α-diol, a committed precursor of chenodeoxycholic acid (reactions 4 and 5). The latter two enzymes perform identical reductions using 7α,12α-dihydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one as substrate, leading to formation of 5β-cholestane-3α,7α,12α-triol. In the rat, 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase also functions as a bile acid-binding protein and may transport bile acids from the sinusoid to the canalicular membrane.¹⁰⁹ Mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP 27) then initiates side-chain modification, which eventually leads to formation of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids (see later).

## Alternative or Acidic Pathway of Bile Acid Synthesis

In contrast to the neutral pathway, the acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis yields predominantly chenodeoxycholic acid. It was believed to contribute quantitatively little to overall bile acid synthesis¹¹⁶,¹³⁶; however, its relative importance may depend on the species studied and pathophysiologic conditions (see later).

The initial step in the alternative pathway is the transport of cholesterol to the inner leaflet of the mitochondrial membrane, where cytochrome P-450 enzyme, sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP27; reaction 1) resides.

CYP27 may sequentially oxidize the 27-hydroxyl group to 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestanoic acid, (reaction 2), or oxidation of the C27-hydroxyl group may proceed via cytosolic nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide (oxidized form) (NAD)-dependent alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (see Fig. 2). Both 27-hydroxycholesterol and 3β-hydroxy-5-cholestenoic acids can be 7α-hydroxylated by a newly discovered microsomal sterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B; reaction 3), a distinct cytochrome P-450 enzyme with homology to cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase but with substrate specificity for side-chain hydroxylated intermediates. 3β-HSDH/ISO then initiates sterol nuclear modification similar to those in the neutral pathway, producing 7α,27-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestene and 7α-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoic acid (reaction 4) followed by reduction reactions and side-chain cleavage to yield chenodeoxycholic acid. Because the acidic pathway can also produce cholic acid in small amounts, 7α,27-dihydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestene may also be a substrate for sterol 12α-hydroxylase (reaction 5).

## Side-Chain Oxidation and Cleavage

After sterol nuclear alterations, 5β-cholestane-3α,7α-diol and 5β-cholestane 3α,7α,12α-triol from the neutral pathway are 27-hydroxylated by mitochondrial sterol 27-hydroxylase (CYP 27), the identical enzyme initiating the acidic pathway (reaction 6, Fig. 3). Similar to the early steps of the acidic pathway, the C-27 hydroxyl group may be directly oxidized to a carboxyl group by sterol 27-hydroxylase or by sequential oxidation by cytosolic alcohol and aldehyde dehydrogenases (reactions 7 and 8). The end product of these reactions are 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestane-27-ol and 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanoic acid. Bile acid CoA-ligase, a microsomal enzyme, then catalyzes CoA esterification to 3α,7α,12α-trihydroxy-5β-cholestanyl-CoA (reaction 9). The terminal steps in side-chain cleavage reside in peroxisomes, where a C₂₄=C₂₅ double bond is introduced (reaction 10), and hydratase/dehydrogenase reactions are performed by a dual-function enzyme (reactions 11 and 12) that hydrates the C₂₄=C₂₅ double bond yielding a 24-hydroxyl group and subsequently oxidizes it to a 24-oxo group by an independent NAD⁺-dependent dehydrogenase activity. Thiolytic cleavage next generates propionate and C₂₄-CoA esters of bile acids (reaction 13). The final step in bile acid biosynthetic pathway (reaction 14) is conjugation of cholic and chenodeoxycholic acids with taurine or glycine, a reaction catalyzed by bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase. Cholic and chenodeoxycholic acid conjugates are then translocated to bile via a canalicular bile acid transporter.

## Contribution of Neutral and Acidic Pathways to Total Bile Acid Synthesis

The relative contribution of the neutral and acidic pathways to total bile acid synthesis was originally studied in postcholecystectomy

inefficient (<20%), suggesting that this pathway was quantitatively less important in healthy patients.¹¹⁶ The acidic pathway, however, may assume a larger quantitative role in patients with chronic liver diseases. Infants with biliary atresia, for example, excrete significant amounts of urinary 3β-hydroxy-5-cholenic acid, an intermediate in the alternative pathway.⁶⁷ Furthermore, patients with advanced cirrhosis synthesize almost exclusively chenodeoxycholic acid, although they have low bile acid biosynthetic rates.¹³³ Most convincingly, Axelson et al³⁴ have identified numerous acidic pathway intermediates but few neutral pathway intermediates in the plasma of patients with cirrhosis, again suggesting that the acidic pathway may predominate in chronic liver disease.

The acidic pathway of bile acid biosynthesis may also contribute to bile acid synthesis by participating in a form of *reverse cholesterol transport*, a process whereby peripheral tissue cholesterol is mobilized and excreted by the liver. Javitt et al⁴⁹,⁵¹ were first to identify 27-hydroxycholesterol in human blood, a finding leading to the hypothesis that 27-hydroxycholesterol may be synthesized in peripheral tissues, transported to the liver in lipoproteins, and converted to primary bile acids. This hypothesis was greatly strengthened by the subsequent demonstration of CYP27 mRNA and activity in peripheral tissues (see later). The peripheral initiation of the acidic pathway of bile acid synthesis probably contributes relatively little to overall bile acid biosynthesis, however.

The relative contribution of the acidic pathway to bile acid synthesis may be more important in rodents than in humans. Using different experimental designs, two groups of investigators reported indirect evidence that the acidic pathway may contribute as much as 50% to total bile acid synthesis in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes.⁸⁸,¹¹³ More recently, an inhibitor of cholesterol biosynthesis, squalestatin, has been used to estimate the relative contribution of the acidic pathway. As discussed later, cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase gene expression in the rat requires a supply of newly synthesized cholesterol, whereas sterol 27-hydroxylase expression does not.³⁰,¹³⁵ After a 24-hour infusion of squalestatin in rats, hepatic cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase specific activity was nearly completely abolished (<5% of controls), but sterol 27-hydroxylase specific activity was completely preserved, a condition in which the contribution of the neutral pathway to bile acid synthesis should be close to zero. Nevertheless, total bile acid synthesis declined by only 50% when compared with control rats infused with saline, again suggesting that the acidic pathway may contribute as much as 50% to total bile acid synthesis. A more prolonged infusion of squalestatin (48 hours) resulted in the return of bile acid synthesis to preinfusion levels, despite continuous suppression of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase activity. These observations strongly suggest induction of oxysterol 7α-hydroxylase activity in the acidic pathway, and support the notion that the acidic pathway in the rat can compensate and maintain bile acid synthesis at near-normal levels under certain conditions.¹³⁰ This interpretation is consistent with the elegant studies of Ishibashi et al⁴⁷ in cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase knockout (CYP7A⁻/⁻) mice. Although many CYP7A⁻/⁻

mice died from fat and fat-soluble vitamin deficiency in the first 3 weeks of life, a small fraction (15%) survived with similar life spans as control mice. After 2 weeks, bile acid synthesis recovered by a cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase-independent pathway to compensate for the absence of the neutral pathway. In the follow-up study, Schwarz et al<sup>100</sup> demonstrated the presence of 7α-hydroxylated intermediates of the acidic pathway in the stool of CYP7<sup>−/−</sup> mice, suggesting that the rescue pathway induced between the third and fourth weeks of life in CYP7<sup>−/−</sup> mice may be the acidic pathway.

# Regulatory Enzymes in Bile Acid Synthesis

To date, the two enzymes that appear to regulate bile acid biosynthesis most highly are CYP7A in the neutral pathway and CYP27 in the acidic pathway; two others, sterol 12α-hydroxylase (CYP12) and CYP7B, may also participate in the regulation of bile acid synthesis, although few data exist to form firm conclusions.

## Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase (CYP 7A)

### Biology

After years of unsuccessful attempts, CYP7A (EC 1.14.13.17) was purified and characterized in the late 1980s by Ogishima et al<sup>79</sup> and Chiang et al<sup>16</sup> and later cloned and sequenced almost simultaneously by three groups of investigators.<sup>52, 64, 77</sup> Sequence analysis provided additional evidence that cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase is a unique cytochrome P-450 enzyme, which was designated as CYP7 and later changed to CYP7A; the latter designation was added after the purification and cloning of sterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP7B).<sup>74</sup> The genes encoding CYP7A have been cloned from rat,<sup>18, 53</sup> human,<sup>20, 71</sup> rabbit,<sup>89</sup> mouse,<sup>126</sup> and hamster;<sup>22</sup> span about 11 kb of the genome; and consist of six exons and five introns. The gene maps to human chromosome 8q11-q12.<sup>20</sup>

The transcriptional regulatory sequences of the CYP7A gene, located in its 5′-flanking region, are highly homologous among the four species analyzed to date, consistent with the observation that the gene is regulated similarly (but not identically; see later) between species. In addition to TATAA and CCAAT elements in the most highly conserved proximal promoter region, a number of putative consensus sequences for binding liver-enriched transcription factors (HNF-3, HNF-4, C/EBP) and inducible transcription factors (thyroid hormone and glucocorticoid receptors) (Fig. 4) have been identified.<sup>21</sup> The CYP7A gene transcribes two mRNA species in rat liver (4 and 2.5 kb) and a single mRNA of 2.8 kb in human liver. Many AUUUUA motifs are found in the 3′ untranslated region of CYP7A mRNAs; these motifs may be responsible for their relatively rapid turnover (1.5 hours). The amino acid sequence of CYP7A between species is also highly homologous (roughly 80% to 90% sequence identity); a putative steroid binding site for cholesterol, an aromatic amino acid region, and a heme-binding region are 100% identical in four

species. An N-terminal hydrophobic sequence characteristic of cytochrome P-450 enzymes is believed to anchor the enzyme to the endoplasmic reticulum.

**Regulation of Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase.** The regulation of CYP7A activity in the rat and probably other species is determined by the sum effect of many regulatory molecules, some of which stimulate and others of which inhibit gene transcription. Some evidence for post-transcriptional regulation of CYP7A has been reported,<sup>39, 118, 123</sup> but most of the data suggest predominant transcriptional regulation.

**Feedback Regulation of Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase by Bile Acids.** The concept of the feedback inhibition of bile acid biosynthesis by bile acids was proposed more than 30 years ago by a group of Swedish investigators<sup>7, 27, 35, 118</sup> and later revisited in the elegant studies of Shefer et al.<sup>103–105</sup> and Mosbach et al.<sup>72</sup> In these studies, the interruption of the enterohepatic circulation of bile acids by biliary diversion increased bile acid synthesis, whereas the intraduodenal reinfusion of bile acids returned bile acid synthetic rates toward normal. After the development of an assay for CYP7A, it became evident that bile acids repressed bile acid synthetic rates by decreasing CYP7A activity;<sup>104, 105</sup> studies in humans using isotope dilution techniques were consistent with these observations.<sup>28</sup> Heuman et al.<sup>42, 43</sup> later observed that bile acids were not equal in their ability to feedback inhibit CYP7A activity in rat liver; hydrophobic bile acids repressed CYP7A specific activity, whereas hydrophilic bile acids, such as ursodeoxycholate, had no effect. These observations have been subsequently confirmed in humans taking ursodeoxycholate to dissolve cholesterol gallstones.<sup>93</sup> The mechanism responsible for the correlation between the physicochemical properties of bile acids and down-regulation of CYP7A remain uncertain but may relate to their differential effects on specific intracellular signaling kinases (see later). After CYP7A was cloned and sequenced, it was quickly appreciated that enzyme activity, protein mass, steady-state mRNA levels, and transcriptional activity of CYP7A all changed in parallel in response to bile acid feeding or biliary diversion, suggesting that bile acids regulate the CYP7A gene,<sup>82, 84</sup> an observation later confirmed in primary cultures.

of rat hepatocytes¹¹⁰,¹²⁴ and in HepG2 cells.¹¹⁷ Twisk et al¹²³ have elegantly demonstrated the bile acid regulation of CYP7A gene expression by describing an increasing lobular gradient of CYP7A transcriptional activity, mRNA levels, and activity from periportal to pericentral hepatocytes. The distribution of CYP7A expression, ascribed to the concentration gradient of bile acids, expanded across the entire lobule after feeding rats bile acid sequestrants and contracted after bile acid feeding.

More recent efforts have focused on determining the mechanisms by which the hepatocyte senses bile acid concentration and hydrophobicity and how the CYP7A gene is subsequently repressed. Bile acids are steroid molecules and, as such, might regulate genes similarly to steroid hormones (i.e., by binding to cytosolic receptors, the complex translocating to hepatocyte nuclei, and interacting with specific recognition sequences in the CYP7A promoter) (Fig. 5; *steroid hormone model*). Alternatively, bile acids also activate effector enzymes in hepatocytes such as protein kinase C¹¹¹ and have also been suggested to repress CYP7A transcription via a protein kinase C–dependent signal transduction cascade.

![Figure 5](https://i.imgur.com/yourimageurl.png)

**Figure 5. Possible mechanisms of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase repression by bile acids.** In the steroid hormone model (left), bile acids may bind to specific receptors in hepatocyte cytosol, and the complex translocates to the nucleus similarly to a steroid hormone. After translocation, the complex may bind to a specific recognition sequence in the cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase 5′-flanking region and decrease its transcriptional activity. In the second messenger model (right), bile acids may activate effector enzymes, such as protein kinase C (PKC), initiating a signaling cascade, which ultimately yields covalently modified transcription factors. This modification may prevent nuclear translocation of positive transcription factors, for example, and thereby decrease cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase transcription.

cade, yielding covalently modified transcription factors (Fig. 5; second messenger model).<sup>112</sup> Because bile acids activate protein kinase C as a function of their hydrophobicity,<sup>91</sup> the mediation of *CYP7A* gene repression by bile acids through protein kinase C might also explain the previously established relationship between *CYP7A* repression and bile acid hydrophobicity.

Five studies have also explored the location of a bile acid-responsive element in the *CYP7A* 5′-flanking region of the rat.<sup>17, 23, 44, 90, 114</sup> Conclusive identification of such a bile acid regulatory sequence remains elusive: neither consensus sequence nor transcription factor has been rigorously identified by detailed mutagenesis. All published reports agree, however, that transcriptional repression of the gene by bile acids is mediated by one or more nucleotide sequences within the most proximal 350 bp relative to the start site of transcription.

The concept of the feedback inhibition of *CYP7A* by bile acids in the enterohepatic circulation has important clinical implications. In classic studies by Hofmann and Poley<sup>45</sup> of patients with Crohn’s disease, resection of less than 100 cm of terminal ileum, quantitatively the most important site of bile acid reabsorption from the gut, resulted in bile acid diarrhea but not steatorrhea. Such patients successfully replace moderate fecal losses of bile acids by derepressing bile acid synthesis, which, in turn, maintains bile acid pool size at normal levels. Bile acids that are not absorbed by diseased or resected ileum are dumped into the colon causing *bile acid diarrhea*. Patients undergoing resection of greater than 100 cm of terminal ileum, however, experience steatorrhea. In such patients, the derepression of *CYP7A* activity and consequent increase in bile acid synthesis are unable to compensate for massive fecal losses, resulting in a decrease of bile acid concentration in the jejunum and maldigestion of dietary triglycerides, cholesterol, and fat-soluble vitamins. The treatment of infants with inborn errors of bile acid biosynthesis (see later) also illustrates an important clinical application of the feedback concept. Infants with genetic defects of certain enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway accumulate toxic bile acid intermediates in the liver, which, in turn, cause cholestasis and chronic liver disease. Oral bile acid supplements containing hydrophobic species, such as cholic acid, repress *CYP7A* activity, which decreases accumulation of these hydrophobic intermediates and ameliorates the toxicity.<sup>97</sup>

**Regulation of Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase by Cholesterol.** The regulation of *CYP7A* transcription by cholesterol differs importantly among species. In the rat, a diet high in cholesterol or the intravenous infusion of mevalonate, a precursor of cholesterol, stimulates *CYP7A*-specific activity, mRNA levels, and transcriptional activities.<sup>54</sup> Other studies have demonstrated the importance of cholesterol in maintaining the basal expression of the rat *CYP7A* gene.<sup>80, 81, 135</sup> In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, the inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis with squalestatin abolished *CYP7A* mRNA levels, which could be restored by supplementing culture medium with cholesterol.<sup>31</sup> The importance of newly synthesized cholesterol in the basal expression of *CYP7A* has also been

shown in rats with bile fistulae, in which a continuous infusion of lovastatin prevented the expected increase in bile acid synthesis.¹³⁵ In the context of cholesterol homeostasis, these observations suggest that the reason cholesterol-fed rats do not develop hypercholesterolemia is feed-forward stimulation of CYP7A by cholesterol, which, in turn, leads to rapid conversion of excess cholesterol to bile acids. In contrast to rats, however, cholesterol feeding represses CYP7A in monkeys,⁹⁶ rabbits,¹³⁹ and hamsters (WM Pandak, unpublished observations), leading to a rapid increase in serum cholesterol levels. Although the response of CYP7A to cholesterol in humans probably more closely resembles the response in monkeys or hamsters, some individuals may be capable of augmenting bile acid biosynthesis on high-cholesterol diets.⁵⁵

The molecular mechanisms by which cholesterol increases CYP7A transcriptional activity in the rat have been clarified. Steroid responsive elements (CACCC/GCC/T CAC), which repress transcription of promoters of sterol (cholesterol and oxysterol)-regulated genes such as HMG-CoA-R, LDL receptor, and HMG-CoA-synthase, have not been found in the promoters of CYP7A gene.¹⁵ Although cholesterol suppresses the expression of these genes, it up-regulates CYP7A expression in the rat. A nuclear receptor for which ligands had been previously unknown (an orphan nuclear receptor), LXRα, has been shown to bind cholesterol and oxysterols and may mediate transcriptional activation of the rat gene.⁶² Peet *et al*⁸⁶ have shown that knock-out mice lacking LXRα failed to induce transcription of the CYP7A gene in response to a high-cholesterol diet.

**Regulation of Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase by Hormones.** Several steroid and peptide hormones have been reported to regulate bile acid biosynthesis and CYP7A activity primarily at the level of gene transcription. Glucocorticoids have long been suspected of regulating CYP7A because of the well-described diurnal variation in bile acid synthesis and CYP7A expression.¹²⁸ The circadian rhythm of CYP7A activity and mRNA levels coincides with circulating cortisol concentrations and is abolished by adrenalectomy.⁷⁸,¹²⁸ Two groups of investigators have subsequently identified functional binding sites for the albumin D-element binding protein in rat CYP7A, which mediate the circadian rhythm of expression of several hepatic genes.³⁶,⁶⁰,⁶¹ Whether glucocorticoids stimulate transcription of the CYP7A gene by classic receptor binding to glucocorticoid response elements or via induction of D-element binding protein binding has not been resolved.

An apparent relationship exists between the regulation of CYP7A expression by glucocorticoids and its regulation by thyroid hormone. Thyroid hormone regulates CYP7A expression, as shown in hypophysectomized rats administered thyroxine.⁷⁵,⁷⁶ In primary cultures of rat hepatocytes, however, supplementation of culture media with thyroid hormone or glucocorticoids alone stimulates CYP7A transcription little, whereas supplementation with both hormones increases CYP7A transcription synergistically 11-fold.⁴⁶ The synergism of thyroid hormone and glucocorticoids has been confirmed in rats with isolated adrenalec-

tomy or thyroidectomy, in which CYP7A transcriptional activity decreased only modestly, whereas more impressive decreases were observed after combined thyroidectomy/adrenalectomy.⁸³ Although putative consensus sequences for glucocorticoid and thyroid hormone receptors have been identified in the 5′-flanking regions of CYP7A in several species, experimental proof of their function and the mechanism of this transcriptional synergy have not been determined.²⁵,¹³⁸

In vitro and in vivo studies also suggest that glucagon⁴⁶ and insulin¹²² down-regulate CYP7A transcriptional activity and mRNA levels. Although it is tempting to speculate that these observations may explain the decrease in bile acid synthesis in fasted laboratory animals, the physiologic role of these hormones in the regulation of CYP7A has yet to be established. Retinoic acid may also regulate the basal transcriptional activity of the CYP7A gene through retinoic acid response elements (see Fig. 4).²⁴

**Regulation of Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase by a Putative Intestinal Factor.** Three observations suggest the possible existence of an intestinal cofactor in the regulation of CYP7A by bile acids. Bjorkhem *et al*¹¹ observed that drainage of lymph, a fluid devoid of bile acids, up-regulated CYP7A and HMG-CoA-R specific activities in rat liver, whereas its reinfusion restored enzyme activities to control levels. Pandak *et al*⁸³ reported that intraduodenal but not intravenous administration of equimolar concentrations of taurocholate repressed CYP7A transcriptional activity. Finally, despite high intrahepatic concentrations of bile acids, rats with common bile duct obstruction paradoxically exhibit increased CYP7A activity. One possible explanation for this last observation is that there may be failure to absorb or secrete a putative intestinal factor into the lymph in the absence of bile acids within the intestinal lumen.³² Although these studies suggest the participation of a putative intestinal factor coregulating CYP7A with bile acids, they fail to explain the ability of bile acids to repress CYP7A expression in primary rat hepatocyte cultures.¹¹⁰

**Regulation of Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase by Cytokines.** It has long been recognized that patients with inflammatory conditions exhibit increased serum cholesterol levels as part of the acute-phase response. One possible mechanism was proposed by Feingold *et al*,³⁷ who showed that endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide) and two inflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis-α and interleukin-1, decrease steady-state of CYP7A mRNA levels and specific activity in hamsters. Other growth factors have also been implicated in CYP7A expression based on the observation that partial hepatectomy causes an initial decline in CYP7A specific activity, followed by recovery.⁷³

**Cholesterol 7α-Hydroxylase Overexpression Studies: Integration of Bile Acid Synthesis and Other Cholesterol Homeostatic Pathways in the Liver.** In elegant studies of Spady *et al*,¹⁰⁷ CYP7A was overexpressed in hamsters using recombinant adenovirus expression vectors. Marked increases in hepatic CYP7A specific activity and mRNA levels were

associated with a dramatic decline in serum LDL cholesterol levels. Moreover, CYP7A virus-infected hamsters fed a high-cholesterol diet did not develop hypercholesterolemia. Other cholesterol homeostatic mechanisms were induced by the overexpression of CYP7A in hamster livers, presumably by the decrease in hepatocyte cholesterol content. Cholesterol biosynthesis was up-regulated at the level of HMG-CoA reductase, as was LDL receptor activity. In addition, Spady et al.¹⁰⁸ overexpressed CYP7A in mice lacking LDL receptor. These landmark studies demonstrate that stimulating bile acid biosynthesis may be a viable therapeutic option in the treatment of hyperlipidemias. In addition, they emphasize the presence of cholesterol homeostatic mechanisms in the liver, although the mechanisms of this coordinate regulation remain obscure.

### Sterol 27-Hydroxylase (CYP27)

#### Biology
Mitochondrial CYP27 (EC 1.14.13.15; also known in previous literature as sterol 26-hydroxylase) catalyzes the initial step in the acidic pathway of bile acid synthesis and hydroxylates bile acid intermediates in the neutral pathway, a process that initiates side-chain oxidation. The genes encoding CYP27 have been cloned and sequenced from rat,¹²⁷ rabbit, and human.¹, ¹³, ¹⁴ Human CYP27 has been mapped to chromosome 2q33-q10.¹⁴ The CYP27 gene contains nine exons and eight introns spanning at least 18.9 kb of DNA;⁶³ the cDNA encodes a protein of 535 amino acid residues, including a 36 amino acid signal sequence that targets the mature protein to mitochondria. The promoter does not have a TATA-box and is GC rich, suggestive of a constitutively expressed gene. The enzyme requires ferredoxin, ferredoxin reductase, and nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (reduced form) (NADPH) for activity.

In contrast to CYP7A, CYP27 is present in extrahepatic tissues. It is expressed at high levels in the liver,¹ ovary,¹¹⁵ vascular endothelium,⁹⁴, ⁹⁵ atherosclerotic plaques,²⁶ macrophages,¹⁴² fibroblasts,⁶ and probably other extrahepatic cells.⁹ CYP27 has a broad substrate specificity inclusive of bile acid intermediates⁹ and cholesterol;¹⁰ it also catalyzes the 25-hydroxylation of vitamin D₃ and the 24-hydroxylation and 25-hydroxylation of cholesterol in pig liver.⁴⁰, ⁶⁶, ¹²⁷ As noted earlier, the ability of this enzyme to convert cholesterol into more polar products in peripheral tissues led to the suggestion that CYP27 may initiate *reverse cholesterol transport*.¹⁰ CYP27 may thereby enhance cholesterol efflux from vascular epithelium, the absence of which in patients with cerebrotendinous xanthomatosis (CTX) results in the accumulation of cholesterol and cholestanol.⁹⁸

#### Regulation of Sterol 27-Hydroxylase
The regulation of CYP27 has only recently received attention; however, the available data suggest certain similarities and dissimilarities with the regulation of CYP7A. Although the effect may be less prominent than for CYP7A, in vitro¹¹³, ¹²¹ and in vivo¹³² studies in the rat demonstrate that CYP27 is down-

regulated by hydrophobic but not hydrophilic bile acids at the level of gene transcription. In the rat, bile acid feeding decreases CYP27-specific activities, mRNA levels, and transcription, whereas cholestyramine and bile fistulae increase all three parameters, consistent with negative feedback regulation. CYP27 may not be repressed by bile acids or stimulated by cholestyramine in the rabbit.²,¹⁴⁰ Similar to CYP7A, CYP27 undergoes diurnal variation,¹³² may be up-regulated by glucocorticoids, and may be down-regulated by insulin¹²² and glucagon (WM Pandak *et al.*, unpublished data). In contrast to CYP7A, thyroid hormone does not stimulate CYP27 mRNA expression in cultured rat hepatocytes,¹¹³ and a high-cholesterol diet does not alter CYP27 mRNA expression in rat or hamster livers (WM Pandak *et al.*, unpublished data).

The mechanisms by which hydrophobic bile acids repress CYP27 transcription have been explored in cultured rat hepatocytes. Using 5′-deletion analysis, bile acid-responsive sequences of the CYP27 promoter were mapped to a region that bound the transcriptional activator, hepatic nuclear factor 1 (HNF-1). Using mobility shift binding assays, relatively hydrophobic bile acids were shown to decrease HNF-1 binding to its recognition sequence. These data suggest that bile acids may regulate the CYP27 gene by decreasing the binding of a transcriptional activator to its promoter, a common mechanism of gene repression.⁹²

## Sterol 12α-Hydroxylase

### Biology
CYP12, a cytochrome P-450 enzyme that determines the rate of cholic acid synthesis,¹⁵,⁹⁷,¹³⁴ was cloned from rabbit liver by Eggertsen *et al.*³³ The CYP12 cDNA encodes a polypeptide of 500 amino acid residues, and its mRNA was found exclusively in the liver. The amino acid sequence shows 39% homology with prostacyclin synthase (CYP8) and CYP7A. Because the ratio of cholic to chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis is determined by CYP12 activity, this may influence the relative hydrophobicity of the bile acid pool, which, in turn, may be an important factor in determining the magnitude of intestinal cholesterol absorption, the rates of biliary cholesterol secretion, and the specific activities of CYP7A and other enzymes affecting cholesterol homeostasis. Gustafsson⁴¹ has shown that 12α-hydroxylation of 5β-cholestane-3α-7α diol can be accomplished by microsomal and mitochondrial fractions of the fetal liver; the relative importance of these two mechanisms is not known, although mitochondrial 12α-hydroxylase activity is not detected in adults.

### Regulation of Sterol 12α-Hydroxylase
The regulation of CYP12 has not been extensively studied because the enzyme resisted purification until recently and the substrate was not readily available. Earlier studies suggested that CYP12-specific activity increased with cholestyramine feeding or ileal resection³⁴ and decreased with bile acid feeding.⁵⁸ In contrast to CYP7A, Mitropoulos *et al*⁷⁰ have shown that activity of CYP12 is stimulated by thyroidectomy and inhibited by thyroxine. The activity of CYP12 is decreased by 50% in rats with streptozotocin-

induced diabetes; insulin replacement normalizes CYP12 specific activity.⁵⁶ CYP12 activity also appears to be higher in female than in male hamsters.⁵⁸ Preliminary observations using cloned CYP12 cDNA suggest that bile acids repress CYP12 at the transcriptional level and that cholesterol feeding represses CYP12-specific activities and mRNA levels (ZR Vlahcevic, unpublished observations).

### Oxysterol 7α-Hydroxylase

#### Biology
The existence of CYP7B has been postulated since Mitropoulos et al⁶⁹ first described the alternative pathway of bile acid synthesis. One mitochondrial and two microsomal activities capable of 7α-hydroxylating oxysterols have been isolated from pig liver.⁴,¹¹⁹ CYP7B activity has also been described in microsomes¹²,¹⁰⁶ and mitochondria¹⁰⁶ of human liver as well as in human fibroblasts,¹⁴² rat ovary,⁸⁵ and brain¹⁴¹ and in hamster liver and Hep G2 cells.⁶⁸ The partially purified enzyme from pig liver microsomes can also hydroxylate 25-hydroxycholesterol and 27-hydroxycholesterol in vitro.¹²⁰

A CYP7B cDNA was isolated from a mouse hippocampus cDNA library.⁹⁹ The CYP7 family of P-450 enzymes now consists of two members, CYP7A and CYP7B, with sequence identity of 35%. In the brain, CYP7B catalyzes 7α-hydroxylation of dehydroepiandrosterone and pregnenolone.

#### Regulation of Oxysterol 7α-Hydroxylase
Little is known about the regulation of CYP7B. CYP7B activity is up-regulated in CYP7A⁻/⁻ knockout mice, in which it probably accounts for the compensatory increase in bile acid synthesis in long-term survivors.¹⁰⁰ Preliminary data showed that bile acids repress CYP7B (ZR Vlahcevic et al, unpublished results).

## INBORN ERRORS OF BILE ACID METABOLISM

Inborn errors of bile acid synthesis are due to deficiency of enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathways, leading to the accumulation of bile acid precursors, which can be detected in urine or plasma by fast atom bombardment ionization–mass spectrometry. Defects of enzymes in the neutral or acidic pathways have been described; defective CYP27 expression in CTX affects both pathways. These rare disorders usually manifest clinically as progressive cholestasis leading to cirrhosis, often with neurologic disease and fat malabsorption. Early diagnosis is important because some of these disorders can be treated with orally administered bile acids. Treatment with cholic acid often results in normalization of liver function tests, improvement in pruritus, resolution of histologic abnormalities, and return to normal growth; liver transplantation is also successful. Defective bile acid synthesis can also be associated with congenital disorders of peroxisomal biogenesis (Zellweg-

er's syndrome), but these disorders are clearly secondary to peroxisomal disease and therefore are not considered here.

# Inborn Errors of Steroid Nuclear Modification

Two inborn errors of steroid nuclear modification have been reported: 3β-HSDH/ISO deficiency<sup>19, 101</sup> and Δ<sup>4</sup>-3-oxosteroid-5β-reductase deficiency.<sup>102</sup> In both diseases, abnormal bile acid precursors can be identified in the urine of affected children. These are inherited as autosomal recessive diseases, manifested by reduced bile acid synthesis, fat-soluble vitamin deficiency, cholelithiasis, giant cell hepatitis, and cirrhosis. Death occurs from complications of portal hypertension and hepatic failure. Therapy of these disorders consists of bile acid supplementation, which stimulates bile acid-dependent flow and represses synthesis of toxic bile acid intermediates, thereby decreasing clinical and laboratory features of cholestasis and the progression to cirrhosis.<sup>29</sup>

# Inborn Errors of Side-Chain Oxidation

CTX is a well-recognized defect in bile acid biosynthesis and is less rare than defects in enzymes involved in steroid nuclear modification. CTX is characterized by absent CYP27 activity, a marked decrease in chenodeoxycholic acid synthesis, and the accumulation of precursors of several bile alcohols in bile, feces, and urine.<sup>98</sup> In contrast to other inborn errors of bile acid metabolism, CTX is not associated with progressive liver disease but rather with neurologic defects, mental retardation, and abnormalities of cholesterol and cholestanol metabolism. The latter compounds accumulate in soft tissues, neural tissue, lungs, and blood vessels, resulting in xanthomas, neurologic dysfunction, cataracts, and premature atherosclerosis. Several different point mutations in the CYP27 gene that result in amino acid substitutions have been identified in patients with CTX.<sup>13, 63</sup> Early diagnosis of CTX is important because therapy with primary bile acids and HMG-CoA-R inhibitors may prevent progression of the disease.

## SUMMARY

During the last 10 years, several key enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway have been cloned and sequenced and their regulation explored. All enzymes for which data exist appear to be predominantly regulated at the level of gene transcription. Studies exploring the quantitative contribution of the two pathways of bile acid biosynthesis suggest that the alternative (acidic) pathway of bile acid synthesis may be more important than previously thought, especially in patients with chronic liver disease. The studies conducted so far have provided evidence.

dence that cholesterol degradative pathways are of major significance in the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis and that genetic makeup of a given individual may determine the predisposition or resistance to atherosclerosis. A number of inborn errors of bile acid metabolism have been described, and therapy with bile acids appears to ameliorate successfully symptoms and progression of liver disease.

# FUTURE RESEARCH

Despite major progress in understanding the regulation of bile acid biosynthetic pathways, a number of important questions remain: (1) What are the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of the enzymes in the bile acid biosynthetic pathway, and how are their activities coordinated? (2) How are the activities of bile acid biosynthetic genes coordinated with hepatic cholesterol input pathways? (3) How do so many up-regulatory and down-regulatory signals converge on the CYP7A promoter to regulate its transcription meaningfully? (4) Can overexpression of key bile acid biosynthetic enzymes decrease the propensity toward atherosclerosis and cholesterol gallstone disease?
