The enterohemorrhagic O157 strain of *Escherichia coli*, which is one of the most well-known bacterial pathogens, has an O-antigen repeating unit structure with the sequence [-2-D-Rha4NAca1-3-L-Fuca1-4-D-Glcβ1-3-D-GalNAca1-]. The O-antigen gene cluster of *E. coli* O157 contains the genes responsible for the assembly of this repeating unit and includes *wbdN*. In spite of cloning many O-antigen genes, biochemical characterization has been done on very few enzymes involved in O-antigen synthesis. In this work, we expressed the *wbdN* gene in *E. coli* BL21, and the His-tagged protein was purified. WbdN activity was characterized using the donor substrate UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc and the synthetic acceptor substrate GalNAca-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph. The enzyme product was isolated by high pressure liquid chromatography, and mass spectrometry showed that one Glc residue was transferred to the acceptor by WbdN. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of the product structure indicated that Glc was β1-3 linked to GalNAc. WbdN contains a conserved DxD motif and requires divalent metal ions for full activity. WbdN activity has an optimal pH between 7 and 8 and is highly specific for UDP-Glc as the donor substrate. GalNAca derivatives lacking the diphosphate group were inactive as substrates, and the enzyme did not transfer Glc to  

GlNAca-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph. Our results illustrate that WbdN is a specific UDP-Glc:GalNAca-diphosphate-lipid β1,3-Glc-transferase. The enzyme is a target for the development of inhibitors to block O157-antigen synthesis.

## Introduction  

Lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) are a major constituent of the outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, where they contribute to antigenic variability and the structural integrity of the cell surface ([Reeves and Wang 2002](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879(02)57001-6)). The LPS also acts as a pro-inflammatory agent and is believed to play a major role in bacterial pathogenesis ([Creydt et al. 2006](https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.70.3.644-680.2006); [Ho and Waldor 2007](https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.00008-07)). LPS is composed of the lipid A anchor, oligosaccharide core and an O-antigenic polysaccharide (O-antigen; [Hitchcock et al. 1986](https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879(86)90004-6); [Goldman and Hunt 1990](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-268360-8.50006-3); [Caroff and Karibian 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879(03)01003-5)). The O-antigen consists of many repeats of a specific oligosaccharide unit and is a major contributor to the antigenic variability of the Gram-negative bacterial cell surface. The O-antigen confers various defense mechanisms to the bacteria ([Sheng et al. 2008](https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.00019-08); [Strauss et al. 2009](https://doi.org/10.1128/MMBR.00019-08)).

The genes responsible for the biosynthesis of O-antigens are normally clustered between *galF* and *gnd* in *Escherichia coli* ([Reeves et al. 1996](https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879(96)90004-5); [Shimizu et al. 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879(99)80004-5)). The putative glycosyltransferase genes found within the O-antigen gene cluster are thought to be responsible for completing the synthesis of the O-antigen repeating unit by adding sugars to the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide. These units are pre-assembled on the cytosolic face of the inner membrane where the catalytic domains of glycosyltransferases are directed into the cytoplasm with access to the nucleotide sugar donor substrate pools, as well as to the membrane-bound undecaprenol-linked acceptor substrates ([Reeves 1994](https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879(94)90004-5); [Whitfield 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/0076-6879(95)90004-5); [Wang and Reeves 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0076-6879(98)80004-5)).

The O157:H7 clone of *E. coli*, which has gained international attention, belongs to the enterohemorrhagic *E. coli* pathovar and is the most prominent clone of this pathovar. It is responsible for a major proportion of cases with hemolytic-uremic syndrome ([Griffin and Tauxe 1991](https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-2836(91)90004-5); [Dean-Nystrom et al. 1997](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(97)90004-5); [Natario and Kaper 1998](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(98)90004-5); [Parma et al. 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(00)90004-5); [Willshaw et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-2836(00)90004-5)).

2001; Kang et al. 2004; Clermont et al. 2007). Escherichia coli O157 synthesizes an O-antigen with a tetrasaccharide repeating unit structure of [-2-D-Rha4NAcα1-3-L-Fucα1-4-D-Glcβ1-3-D-GalNAcα1-], preassembled on undecaprenyl diphosphate (PP-Und; Vinogradov et al. 1998). The genes of the O157-antigen gene cluster include putative glycosyltransferase genes *wbdN*, *wbdO*, *wbdP* as well as genes responsible for the synthesis of glycosyltransferase substrates (Raetz and Whitfield 2002; Samuel and Reeves 2003; Valvano 2003). As with other O-antigens in *E. coli*, the assembly of PP-Und-linked O-antigen repeating units is initiated by transfer of GlcNAc-phosphate, or GalNAc-phosphate, by GlcNAc/GalNAc-phosphotransferase WecA to P-Und. The *wecA* gene is located outside of the O157-antigen gene cluster. However, GalNAc-PP-Und can be synthesized reversibly by GlcNAc-PP-Und 4-epimerase in *E. coli* O157 (Rush et al. 2010). Three sugars are then added to GalNAc-PP-Und to complete the formation of the O157 repeating unit (Supplementary data, Figure S1). The enzymes necessary for the completion of the

O157 subunit are predicted to be encoded by the genes *wbdN*, *wbpP* and *wbpO* (Shimizu et al. 1999; Rump et al. 2010), respectively. The lipid-linked tetrasaccharide is then transferred across the inner membrane by flippase Wzx, followed by polymerization in the periplasmic space by Wzy to form a lipid-linked polysaccharide. The *wzz* gene located on the chromosome between the *gnd* and *his* genes is responsible for regulating the O-antigen chain length (Franco et al. 1998). This is then followed by the ligation of the completed O157-specific polysaccharide to the lipid A-core moiety and the transport of the completed LPS to the outer membrane by the Ltx complex (Wang and Reeves 1998; Freinkman et al. 2011).

Very few of the cloned O-antigen synthesis genes have been biochemically characterized. WbdN shares 79% amino acid sequence identity with the glycosyltransferase encoded by the *wfaM* gene in the *E. coli* O24-antigen gene cluster (Cheng et al. 2006). The O-antigen of *E. coli* O157 and O24 share only one common linkage: D-Glcpβ1-3-D-GalpNAc (Torgov et al. 1995).

Therefore, we proposed that WbdN shares the same function with WfaM and is involved in the second step of O157-antigen synthesis, i.e. the transfer of Glc to GalNAc-R. We have previously synthesized GlcNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph (580) to characterize several glycosyltransferases that add a sugar residue to GlcNAc (Riley et al. 2005; Brockhausen, Larsson, et al. 2008; Brockhausen, Riley, et al. 2008; Brockhausen, Hu, et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2011). The corresponding GalNAc derivative GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph (640) was synthesized based on the original synthesis. In the present work, biochemical approaches were used to characterize the WbdN enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of Glc to GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph. We were able to show that WbdN is a UDP-Glc:GalNAc-diphosphate-lipid β1,3-Glc-transferase with a strict donor and acceptor specificity. The enzyme is a target for blocking O157-antigen synthesis and for the development of chemo-enzymatic vaccine synthesis.

**Results**

**Properties of WbdN**

A BLAST comparison revealed that the amino acid sequence of WbdN from *E. coli* O157 shares 42% identity with uncharacterized WbdN from *E. coli* O81, 99% identity with WbdN from *Escherichia fergusonii* (Fegan et al. 2006) and 79% identity with WfaM from *E. coli* O24. Homologs of WbdN are also found in a number of other bacterial strains. None of these enzymes have been characterized. WbdN shares 32 and 33% identity with β1,3-Glc-transferases WfaP (*E. coli* O56) and WfgD (*E. coli* O152) (Brockhausen, Larsson, et al. 2008), respectively, but very low (10%) identity with the expected gene product (α1,3-Glc-transferase) of the *wbbG* gene (*E. coli* O148; Feng et al. 2007). The other putative glycosyltransferases (WbpP and WbpO) encoded by genes located in the O157-antigen gene cluster share only 5 and 13% identity, respectively, with WbdN. Similarly, very low sequence identity (<12%) was found between WbdN and other bacterial and eukaryotic glycosyltransferases. The predicted protein fold of WbdN is a GT-A glycosyltransferase

fold, and like other β1,3-Glc-transferases, WbdN has been classified in the CAZy GT2 family that includes many other bacterial and mammalian inverting β-glycosyltransferases. All of the WbdN homologs, as well as WfaM, have a DxD sequence that may be involved in catalysis (Breton et al. 2006).

Under standard conditions, the transfer of Glc to GalNAcα-O-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph was linear up to 10 min incubation time and up to 0.12 mg/mL of protein concentration for the purified WbdN. WbdN activity in the bacterial homogenate was stable for several days at room temperature, for at least 2 weeks at 4°C and for at least 4 months at −20°C.

The conserved presence of the DxD motif (DxDD) in the WbdN sequence suggested the involvement of divalent metal cations as cofactors in Glc-transferase catalysis (Ünlügil and Rini 2000; Breton et al. 2006). In order to determine the requirement of WbdN for divalent metal cations, MnCl₂, other divalent metal cations, or ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) were tested. Mn²⁺, Mg²⁺ and Co²⁺ were shown to be efficient cofactors at 5 mM. None of the other metal ions tested (Pb²⁺, Ca²⁺, Zn²⁺ and Cu²⁺), or EDTA were effective in stimulating Glc-transferase activity (Figure 1A). Half-maximal activity was reached at 2.26 mM MnCl₂ concentration (Figure 1B). WbdN activity was shown to have a broad optimum pH between 7 and 8 (Supplementary data, Figure S2).

### Membrane association analysis and purification of WbdN

Kyte and Doolittle hydropathy analysis showed that WbdN is not an integral membrane protein. However, a short hydrophobic sequence at the N-terminal region may be responsible for the association of the enzyme with the membrane. We, therefore, tested if detergent would solubilize and activate the enzyme. However, the activity decreased dramatically with increasing Triton X-100 concentrations in the assay, exhibiting less than 4% activity at 1% Triton X-100 (Supplementary data, Figure S3). To test the extent to which WbdN in bacterial homogenates was associated with the plasma membrane, disrupted cells were fractionated by centrifugation at 100,000 × g; 18% of the total activity was found in the supernatant, whereas 82% stayed with the pellet fraction.

The molecular weight of WbdN containing a His₆ tag was calculated to be 31 kDa (protein molecular mass calculator; Science Gateway, www.sciencegateway.org). The bacterial lysate showed an intense band on sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) at 31 kDa which was induced by isopropyl 1-thio-β-d-galactopyranoside (IPTG; Supplementary data, Figure S4a). The His-tagged enzyme was purified by Ni²⁺-nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) affinity chromatography (Supplementary data, Figure S4b). Western blotting showed a major protein band at 31 kDa for both the cell lysate and the purified enzyme (Supplementary data, Figure S4c). The specific activity of purified WbdN was enriched 28-fold, compared with that of the lysate, to a specific activity of 0.98 μmol/h/mg.

### Analysis of WbdN enzyme product

To validate the in vitro synthesis of WbdN enzyme product, aliquots of assay mixtures were applied to Sep-Pak C18 columns and the enzyme product eluted with MeOH. The electrospray ionization (ESI)-mass spectrum (negative-ion mode) of the MeOH eluate showed the presence of a substrate (*m/z* 626) and enzyme product (*m/z* 788) (Figure 2). The Sep-Pak step was required for the efficient HPLC separation of the product. On reversed-phase HPLC using 28% acetonitrile/72% water as the mobile phase, the enzyme product Glc-GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph was eluted between 36 and 55 min. The radioactive product served as a standard for HPLC. The fractions containing enzyme product were pooled and analyzed by ESI-MS, showing *m/z* 788 for Glc-GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph (Figure 2). This demonstrated that one Glc residue (*m/z* 162) had been added to the substrate GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph by WbdN and that substrate and product were well separated on HPLC.

The Glcβ1-3GalNAc- linkage in the enzyme product was not cleaved by active α- and β-glycosidases, including a β1,3-glucanase (data not shown). Therefore, for linkage analysis, product was prepared in a reaction mixture scaled up 1000-fold over the standard assay mixture with a GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph acceptor substrate and the product was purified by C18 Sep-Pak and HPLC. The isolated product was then analyzed by one- and two-dimensional NMR spectroscopy including correlation spectroscopy, heteronuclear single-quantum coherence, heteronuclear multiple bond correlation (HMBC) and nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY; Figure 3, Supplementary data, Figure S5). Two-dimensional NMR analysis helped to identify the ¹H and ¹³C signals from the Glc and GalNAc rings, as well as the long-range coupling of the enzyme product residues. The product was identified as Glcβ1-3GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph, with a signal of β-Glc-H-1 at 4.48 ppm (*J*₁,₂ = 7.8 Hz) and the H-1 of GalNAc-R at 5.53 ppm (Table 1, Figure 3A). Although the H-3 signals of the substrate 640 (3.78–3.88 ppm) were shifted to 3.98 in the WbdN product, the H-4 signal was also shifted from 3.90–3.94 to 4.19 ppm in the product. The largest difference between substrate and product in the ¹³C signals was seen for the C-3 signal which was 66.9 ppm in the substrate and 77.4 ppm in the product. Neither H-6 nor C-6 signals showed large differences between substrate and product; thus, a β1-6 linkage is unlikely.

A strong NOE coupling between H-1 of Glc and the H-3 of GalNAc-R was seen in the NOESY spectrum (Figure 3B). In addition, the HMBC spectrum revealed the coupling between the H-1 of Glc and the C-3 of GalNAc-R (Figure 3C). This confirmed the Glcβ1-3GalNAc-R linkage in the WbdN product. The chemical shifts of the Glc residue were similar but not identical in the spectra of the enzyme products of WfaP and WfgD β3-Glc-transferases, Glcβ1-3GlcNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph (Brockhausen, Hu et al. 2008). Those spectra were taken in CD₃OD which causes a slight difference in chemical shifts. We noticed that in dilute D₂O solutions of the WbdN product, the resolution of WbdN product NMR signals was much better than in concentrated samples, probably because concentrated solutions contain micelle-like associations of the detergent-like compounds.

### Acceptor substrate specificity of WbdN

The acceptor substrate specificity of WbdN in bacterial homogenates was tested with a series of synthetic acceptor substrate
Intensity, counts

Fig. 2. ESI-MS (negative-ion mode) of WbdN product. WbdN product was produced using bacterial sonicate, as described in Materials and methods, isolated by Sep-Pak C18 and analyzed by ESI-MS (negative-ion mode). Both $m/z$ 626 (substrate) and $m/z$ 788 (product) are at a single charge state. The absence of $m/z$ 950 indicates that only one Glc residue ($m/z$ 162) was transferred. amu, atomic mass unit.

analogs, including GalNAcα-glycopeptides and GalNAc α- and β-linked to a number of different hydrophobic aglycone groups, as well as GlcNAc derivatives (Table 2). The only compound in this series that could serve as an acceptor substrate was GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph but not the corresponding GlcNAc analog GlcNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph or any other GalNAc or GlcNAc derivative. This suggested that the presence of a diphosphate bridge in the acceptor as well as the axial 4-hydroxyl of the acceptor sugar were required for the activity of WbdN. Purified WbdN had an apparent $K_{\text{M}}$ for GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph of 0.032 mM, and $V_{\text{max}}$ was 1.9 μmol/h/mg (Figure 4A). For UDP-Glc, the apparent $K_{\text{M}}$ was 0.039 mM, with a $V_{\text{max}}$ of 2.3 μmol/h/mg (Figure 4B).

Donor specificity of WbdN

The donor specificity of WbdN was examined by replacing 0.2 mM UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc with a number of other nucleotide sugars in the assay. No activity was observed with 0.46 mM

UDP-[³H]GalNAc, 0.3 mM CMP-[³H]sialic acid or 0.23 mM GDP-[³H]Fuc. Minor activities were observed with 0.75 mM UDP-[³H]Gal (1.4% of the activity with UDP-Glc) and 0.5 mM UDP-[³H]GlcNAc (2.5% of the activity with UDP-Glc) (Figure 5). This was indicative of a strict specificity of WbdN for UDP-Glc as the donor substrate. It also suggested the absence of other glycosyltransferases in the BL21 bacterial homogenates that could act on GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph.

Discussion

WbdN has been identified as a UDP-Glc: GalNAcα-diphosphate-lipid β1,3-D-Glc-transferase which catalyzes the second step of the O-antigen repeating unit assembly in *E. coli* O157. There are two other putative glycosyltransferase genes in the *E. coli* O157-antigen gene cluster (wbdO and wbdP) that may encode the α1,4-L-Fuc-transferase and α1,3-D-Rha4NAc-transferase

WbdN assays were performed as described in Materials and methods for the standard assays. Neutral compounds were assayed by the AG1 × 8 method. Compounds 640 and 580 were assayed by the C18 Sep-Pak method. Bold amino acids indicate the glycosylation site.

Fig. 4. Kinetics of WbdN reaction. (A) The standard assay as described under Materials and methods was used to measure glucosyl transfer by purified WbdN to acceptor 640 as a function of acceptor concentration. The UDP-Glc donor concentration was 0.42 mM. The results were analyzed by regression analysis with ENZFITTER. The apparent $K_{M}$ was determined to be 0.032 mM with an apparent $V_{max}$ of 1.9 $\mu$mol/h/mg protein. (B) Glucosyl transfer by purified WbdN to acceptor 640 (0.04 mM) is shown as a function of UDP-Glc concentration. UDP-Glc concentration was varied as indicated and the results were analyzed by regression analysis with ENZFITTER program. The apparent $K_{M}$ was determined to be 0.039 mM with an apparent $V_{max}$ of 2.3 $\mu$mol/h/mg protein.

from *E. coli* O157 and proteins from other bacteria that have been assigned as WbdN, we assume that all WbdN proteins, as well as WfaM, are $\beta$1,3-Glc-transferases that act on GalNAc$\alpha$-diphosphate-lipid acceptor. However, biochemical analyses of these proteins are necessary to confirm their functions. Sometimes, a single amino acid or subtle changes in the protein can alter the substrate-binding properties of a glycosyltransferase (Brockhausen 2010).

Analysis of the structures of the WbdN enzyme product by HPLC, MS and NMR spectroscopy clearly showed that WbdN adds one Glc residue in $\beta$1-3 linkage to GalNAc$\alpha$-O-PO$_{3}$-PO$_{3}$-(CH$_{2}$)$_{11}$-O-Ph, an analog of the natural substrate. To determine the linkage, both 1D and 2D-NMR experiments were employed. NOESY and HMBC experiments clearly demonstrated the $\beta$1-3 linkage between Glc and

necessary to complete the assembly of the O157 repeating unit. The wzx and wzy genes in the gene cluster then are expected to encode the flippase and polymerase, respectively (Raetz and Whitfield 2002; Samuel and Reeves 2003; Valvano 2003). Because of the high similarity between WbdN

Nucleotide Sugar

Fig. 5. Donor specificity of WbdN. Glycosyl transfer to acceptor 640 as a function of nucleotide sugar donor. The standard assay as described under Materials and methods was used except the nucleotide sugar was varied as indicated (0.20 mM UDP-Glc, 2200 cpm/nmol; 0.75 mM UDP-Gal, 1750 cpm/nmol; 0.5 mM UDP-GlcNAc, 2900 cpm/nmol; 0.46 mM UDP-GalNAc, 3800 cpm/nmol; 0.3 mM CMP-sialic acid, 3600 cpm/nmol; or 0.23 mM GDP-Fuc, 970 cpm/nmol). The activity with 0.2 mM UDP-Glc was set to 100%.

GalNAc in the enzyme product Glcβ1-3GalNAcα-O-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph. We therefore identified WbdN as a UDP-Glc: GalNAcα-diphosphate-lipid β1,3-Glc-transferase which corresponds to the structure of the O157-antigen and establishes WbdN as the second enzyme in the O157-antigen repeating unit pathway.

The synthetic acceptor substrate GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph is an amphipathic molecule with similarity to the endogenous substrate GalNAcα-PP-Und that acts as a lipid carrier in O-antigen biosynthesis and is exposed at the cytoplasmic side of the inner membrane (Amor and Whitfield 1997). We have shown that GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph is an excellent synthetic acceptor substrate analog for WbdN in vitro and has the advantage that substrate and enzymatic reaction product can be readily detected and separated by HPLC.

This acceptor has previously been used to characterize an α1,3-GalNAc-transferase from *E. coli* O86:H2 (Yi et al. 2006), and we have shown that it also serves as a substrate for enzymes from other bacterial strains (unpublished results). The corresponding analog GlcNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph has also been shown to be an excellent acceptor for Gal- and Glc-transferases from *E. coli* serotypes (Montoya-Peleaz et al. 2005; Riley et al. 2005; Brockhausen, Hu, et al. 2008) but does not serve as a substrate for WbdN. Therefore, the axial 4-OH of GalNAc is critical for the activity of WbdN. The chemical synthesis of additional substrate analogs will reveal further details of the substrate recognition of WbdN.

There is limited sequence identity between other Glc-transferases and WbdN. However, since they share similar donor and acceptor substrates and are dependent on divalent cations for activity, similarities may be mainly found in the substrate binding and catalytic domains which remain to be determined. In addition, all of the enzymes characterized to date that assemble O-antigens lack a transmembrane domain and probably reside close to the cytosolic face of the inner membrane with access to both the soluble nucleotide sugar pools and the membrane-bound substrates. Our in vitro assays destroy this organization but allow accurate measurement of the enzyme activity with a hydrophobic acceptor which mimics the natural substrate. Since WbdN acts in vitro on phenoxyundecyl-containing compounds and is thought to act on Und-based substrates in vivo, there may not be a requirement for a specific lipid moiety in the acceptor. The glycosyltransferases studied by us that catalyze the second step in O-antigen synthesis appear to have limited solubility and may thus be tethered to the membrane by a yet unknown mechanism, possibly by an enzyme complex formation.

The sequence hydrophobicity analysis indicated that the amino acids at positions 4–9, 33–38, 115–118, 182–184 and 239–242 are hydrophobic which may assist the association of WbdN with the cell membrane. However, this part of the sequence is missing in WfaM which may have a similar function as WbdN. Since a considerable portion of the enzyme activity was lost after purification, the association with membrane components may be a critical factor for in vitro activity and may be necessary to hold the detergent-like acceptor substrate and the enzyme in the right position that favors glucose transfer. However, it is possible that the enzyme is not properly folded or unstable in the purified form due to lack of membrane factors (Laan et al. 2003). WbdN has five Cys residues, and the activity may possibly be destroyed by oxidation. The activity was also gradually lost when increasing the percentage of detergent in the assay which may have altered the accessibility by the enzyme active site to the substrate due to unfavorable micelle formation.

Biochemical analyses of glycosyltransferases are critical to determine their specific functions in O-antigen assembly. Like eukaryotic glycosyltransferases, WbdN has a DxD motif (Breton et al. 2006), requires divalent metal ion for activity, utilizes a specific donor substrate, UDP-Glc, and has distinct specificity for the sugar residue and the diphosphate group in the acceptor substrate. The divalent metal ion may interact with the diphosphate group of UDP-Glc; together with an acidic group of the DxD motif this could support the transfer of Glc from UDP-Glc to the oxygen atom at C-3 of GalNAc. The DxD motif has been shown to interact with the sugar donor substrate in the Mn²⁺-stimulated reaction of LgtC Gal-transferase from *N. meningitides* (Persson et al. 2001) and a number of other glycosyltransferases (Unligil and Rini 2000; Breton et al. 2006). Site-directed mutagenesis could confirm the importance of the acidic amino acid residues in catalysis. In β1,4-Gal-transferase WfeD, the central Glu residue of the DYEIE sequence was shown to be the essential residue (Xu et al. 2011). In addition, the binding of the negatively charged acceptor and donor substrates may be facilitated by divalent metal ions or by positively charged amino acids. Thus, Lys211 has been shown to be essential for the activity of WfeD (Xu et al. 2011). Further studies of the protein structure of WbdN will reveal the importance of its DxD

motif and clustered positively charged amino acids. Our preliminary results show that positively charged alkane-containing compounds can inhibit WbdN activity but the mechanism of inhibition remains to be determined. As the second enzyme in the O157 biosynthesis pathway, WbdN is a suitable target for blocking O157-antigen synthesis. The characterization of the β1,3-Glc-transferase activity is also the basis for the development of chemo-enzymatic vaccine synthesis.

### Materials and methods

#### General
Protein concentrations were determined with the Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Mississauga, ON) and the protein concentration calibration curve was established with bovine serum albumin. Ni²⁺-NTA resin used for WbdN purification was obtained from Qiagen (Toronto, ON). Flash column chromatography was performed on Silicycle silica gel (230–400 mesh, 60 Å). Preparative-scale chromatography was performed on Silicycle SiliaPlate glass-backed TLC 60 Å plates (2000 μm thick) cut to 10 cm × 10 cm. Analytical thin-layer chromatography was performed on glass-backed pre-coated silica gel 60 F254 plates (Silicycle, Quebec City, QC), and the compounds were visualized by UV illumination (254 nm). Melting points were measured on a Mel-Temp II apparatus and are uncorrected. ^1^H and ^13^C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance 400 spectrometer in DMSO-*d*₆. The chemical shifts are reported in δ (ppm) relative to tetramethylsilane using the residual solvent peak as an internal reference. High-resolution ESI mass spectra were recorded on an Applied Biosystems/MDS Sciex QSTAR XL mass spectrometer (Framingham, MA) with an Agilent HP1100 Cap-LC system. Samples were run in 50% aqueous MeOH at a flow rate of 6 μL/min.

#### Materials
Reagents and materials were obtained from Sigma unless otherwise stated. The synthesis of the sodium salt 640, GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph, was adapted from the synthesis of GlcNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph (Montoya-Peleaz et al. 2005; Utkina et al. 2010). In addition, it was synthesized by a new method that will be published elsewhere (NMR parameters are shown in Table 1) and used to produce large scale enzyme product. 640 showed the following NMR and high resolution ESIMS (HRESIMS) data: ^1^H NMR (400 MHz, CD₃OD) δ: 1.30–1.35 (m, 12H, 6CH₂), 1.38 (m, 2H, CH₂), 1.55 (m, 2H, CH₂), 1.67 (m, 2H, CH₂), 1.95 (s, 3H, CH₃CO), 3.64 (dd, 1H, *J*₆,₆′ 12.0 Hz, H-6′), 3.71 (dd, 1H, *J*₆,₆′ 12.0 Hz, H-6), 3.83 (bs, 1H, H-4), 3.88 (m, 2H, CH₂OPh), 3.97(m, 2H, CH₂OP), 4.08 (m, 1H, H-3), 4.25 (bd, 1H, H-2), 5.57 (bs, 1H, H-1), 6.80 (m, 3H, aromatic protons) and 7.15 (m, 2H, aromatic protons); ^13^C NMR (150.90 MHz, CD₃OD) δ: 174.5, 160.7, 130.5, 121.6 and 115.7 (aromatic carbons), 96.72 (d, C-1), 75.1 (C-5), 77.1 (C-4), 73.94 (C-3), 69.06 (CH₂OPh), 67.68 (CH₂OP), 63.02 (C-6) and 51.54 (d, C-2); ^31^P NMR (242.94 MHz, CD₃OD) δ: −10.75 (bd, P-2) and −12.68 (bd, P-1); HRESIMS: calculated for C₂₅H₄₃NO₁₃P₂Na [M + H]⁺: *m/z* 650.2102; found: *m/z* 650.2073.

GalNAc-derivatives were synthesized previously (Riley et al. 2005, 2010; Brockhausen et al. 2006; Gao et al. 2010). Glycopeptides were synthesized by Hans Paulsen, University Hamburg, Germany. Khushi Matta (Roswell Park Cancer Institute, Buffalo, NY, USA) provided GalNAcβ1-4GlcNAcβ-O-benzyl.

#### Bacterial growth, plasmids and protein expression
The putative glycosyltransferase gene *wbdN* from *E. coli* O157 was amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into expression plasmid vector pET28a (Kan¹), containing a cleavable His-tag-encoded sequence at the C-terminus. Plasmid constructs were transformed into *E. coli* BL21 for protein expression. For the induction of plasmid-derived enzyme, bacteria were grown overnight at 37°C in 5 mL of Luria broth containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin with constant shaking at 150 rpm. The bacterial suspension (5 mL) was transferred to 125 mL of Luria-broth containing kanamycin and the mixture was incubated at 37°C. IPTG was added to a final concentration of 1 mM when the suspension reached an absorbance at 600 nm of 0.8. Cells were grown for an additional 4 h at 37°C and were then harvested by centrifugation for 15 min at 4000 rpm (Beckman J2-21M, JA17 rotor). Pellets were washed in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A total of 10 mL of PBS containing 10% glycerol were added and aliquots of bacteria were stored at −20°C for enzyme assays.

#### Glucosyltransferase activity assays
Bacterial homogenate was obtained as described before (Montoya-Peleaz et al. 2005; Riley et al. 2005) by sonication in 50 mM sucrose. The standard assay mixtures for WbdN (total of 40 μL volume) contained: 0.025 mM acceptor substrate GalNAcα-O-PO₃-PO₃-(CH₂)₁₁-O-Ph (640), 5 mM MnCl₂, 10% MeOH, 0.125 M 2-(N-morpholino)ethanesulfonic acid buffer, pH 7, 10 μL of enzyme homogenate containing 50–80 μg protein and 0.3 mM UDP-[¹⁴C]Glc (2000–3000 cpm/nmol) or 0.46 mM UDP-[³H]Glc (4000–6000 cpm/nmol). Control assays lacked the acceptor. All assays were carried out in at least duplicate. Mixtures were incubated for 10 min at 37°C, and reactions quenched by the addition of 700 μL of ice-cold water. Reaction product was isolated using Sep-Pak C18 eluted first in water, then in MeOH, and was quantified by scintillation counting as described (Brockhausen, Hu, et al. 2008; Xu et al. 2011). HPLC separations were carried out as described (Riley et al. 2005), using a C18 column and acetonitrile/water as the mobile phase. Kinetic parameters were determined using the program or ENZFITTER or OriginPro8.0 (May and Stevenson 2009).

#### Enzyme purification
WbdN protein containing a His₆-tag at the C terminus was purified using Ni²⁺-NTA Sepharose (Qiagen, Toronto, ON). Bacterial pellets were resuspended at 0.2 mg protein/mL in lysis buffer (10 mM Na-phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl₂ and 0.1 mM ethyleneglycol tetraacetic acid (EGTA), pH 7.2, with EDTA-free protease inhibitor, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol and 0.2 mM ATP added right before use) and

sonicated for four cycles at 55 s with 3 min intervals on ice (Misonix Sonicator 3000, program 1, power 7.0). 0.02 g of DNase per 100-mL bacterial homogenate was added and mixtures were further incubated on ice for 15 min. The homogenate was then centrifuged at 21,000 rpm (JA20 rotor in Beckman JA21 centrifuge) for 30 min. The His<sub>6</sub>-tagged fusion protein in the supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography with a Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA column. Bound proteins were eluted with a gradient of 200–600 mM imidazole buffer containing the same content as the lysis buffer except for the protease inhibitor. Each fraction was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (12% gel). The desired fractions that contain fusion protein were pooled and dialyzed in dialysis buffer (10 mM Na-phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM EGTA, pH 7.2, with EDTA-free protease inhibitor, 0.2 mM ATP and 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine) at 4°C overnight.

Western blot analysis was performed with rabbit antibody against the His<sub>6</sub> tag as the primary antibody (provided by Dr Ken Jarrell, Queen's University) and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG as the secondary antibody (Promega, Madison, WI). Ni<sup>2+</sup>-NTA-purified WbdN and cell lysates (0.03–0.05 μg protein/μL) were diluted two times in 10 μL of SDS-PAGE loading buffer consisting of 2% SDS, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 4% glycerol, 40 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8) and 0.01% Bromophenol blue and run on SDS-PAGE (12% gel). With an electrical field applied (15 V, 30 min), proteins were transferred onto polyvinylidene difluoride membrane (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Membranes were blocked with 10% blocking reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Laval, QC) in Tris-buffered saline with 1% Tween-20 and then probed sequentially with anti-His antibody (1:5000) and anti-rabbit IgG (1:10,000) (Towbin et al. 1979). Labeling was visualized with 10 mL of a 1:1 mixture of a chemiluminescence blotting substrate and peroxide solution (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). Prestained protein standards (Fermentas, Burlington, ON) were used to calibrate the gels. The western blot film was developed based on Boehringer Mannheim Chemiluminescence Blotting Substrate protocol.

### Product identification using MS, HPLC and NMR

The enzyme product was prepared in large-scale radioactive and non-radioactive forms for HPLC, HPLC-MS and NMR analyses, respectively. The non-radioactive assay mixture (40 mL) contained 8 μmol GalNAcα-O-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Ph 640, 18.4 μmol UDP-Glc, 10 mL bacterial cell homogenate in 0.25 M sucrose, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.125 M Tris-buffer, pH 8.0. After incubation for 30 min at 37°C, 20 mL of cold water was added to stop the reaction. The reaction mixture was then applied to a total of 60 C18 Sep-Pak columns and product eluted with methanol. Following flash evaporation and lyophilization of the eluate, enzyme product was resuspended in water and further purified by reversed-phase HPLC using a C18 column (Riley et al. 2005) with a 28% acetonitrile/72% water mixture in the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Peaks were monitored by measuring absorbance at 195 nm and the use of standard compounds. Pooled fractions were then flash evaporated and lyophilized. Compounds were analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization MS or ESI-MS in the negative-ion mode, as described previously

(Riley et al. 2005). The dried pooled enzyme product fractions were dissolved in D<sub>2</sub>O and analyzed by 600-MHz NMR. Spectra were collected in 1D and 2D experiments using a Bruker spectrometer as described (Brockhausen, Hu, et al. 2008).

#### Ultracentrifugation of bacterial membranes

To determine how the enzyme distributes between soluble and membrane-associated fractions, enzyme sonicate in 50 mM sucrose was centrifuged at 100,000 × g for 30 min at 4°C in a TLX Ultracentrifuge using a Beckman TLA 100 rotor. Pellets were resuspended in 50 mM sucrose buffer. The original homogenate, pellet suspension and supernatant fractions were assayed for Glc-transferase activity (0.05 mM GalNAcα-O-PO<sub>3</sub>-PO<sub>3</sub>-(CH<sub>2</sub>)<sub>11</sub>-O-Ph as an acceptor substrate).
