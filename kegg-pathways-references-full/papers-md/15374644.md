Quorum sensing control of lantibiotic production; nisin and subtilin autoregulate their own biosynthesis

a high degree of post-translational modification prior to secretion [14,25,57], and (ii) type II or heat-stable AMPs that include unmodified but secreted peptides [28,48].

AMP production by a number of Gram-positive bacteria is regulated in a cell-density-dependent manner. Production of these AMPs is generally initiated at mid- to end-logarithmic growth phase
[65]. Modification of the 34-residue C-terminal mature region includes the introduction of one dehydroalanine (Dha) and two dehydrobutyrine residues, as well as four methyllanthionine and one lanthionine cyclic structures (Fig. 1A). A natural variant of nisin A (called nisin Z) has been identified, which differs only by the exchange
gene clusters contain genes that encode EnvZ-OmpR-type [50,63] two-component regulation systems, composed of a sensor kinase (*nisK* and *spaK*, respectively) [18] and a response regulator (*nisR* and *spaR*, respectively) [36] that are involved in transcriptional regulation of the *nis* and *spa* genes, respectively. Detectable
plishes balanced relative production levels of the subtilin precursor, its modification and export machinery (spaBCT), and the subtilin immunity level of the producing cell (spaIFEG) [30, 62]. Although these characteristics of the three subtilin-responsive spa promoters appear to be consistently found by different researchers, the exact positioning of especially the spaS and spal promoters and the corresponding regulatory mechanism
upstream fragment of only 74 nucleotides, thereby lacking either of the two previously described promoters, is completely functional as a highly active and subtilin-inducible promoter when translationally fused to the promoterless *Escherichia coli gusA* gene [30]. Moreover, primer extension on the corresponding *gusA* transcript identified a prominent, subtilin induction-dependent transcription start site
only qualitative in vitro evidence for NisR binding to the wild-type *nisA* promoter sequence has become available [13, 32]. However, a recent study described the interaction of SpaR to its cognate *spa*-box in detail [61]. SpaR was shown to specifically bind to the *spaB*, *spaS*, and *spaI* DNA promoter fragments by means of electro
