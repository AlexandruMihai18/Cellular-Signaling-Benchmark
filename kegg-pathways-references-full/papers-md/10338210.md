## Summary

The crystal structure of a proteolytic subfragment from scallop striated muscle myosin, complexed with MgADP, has been solved at 2.5 Å resolution and reveals an unusual conformation of the myosin head. The converter and the lever arm are in very different positions from those in either the pre-power stroke or near-rigor state structures; moreover, in contrast to these structures, the SH1 helix is seen to be unwound. Here we compare the overall organization of the myosin head in these three states and show how the conformation of three flexible “joints” produces rearrangements of the four major subdomains in the myosin head with different bound nucleotides. We believe that this novel structure represents one of the prehydrolysis (“ATP”) states of the contractile cycle in which the myosin heads stay detached from actin.

## Introduction

Current structural data on the conformation of myosin have revealed two states of the myosin head at atomic resolution, but there are conflicting interpretations of their place in the contractile cycle. These two states differ by the closure of the 50 kDa cleft within the motor domain and by the position of the converter and the orientation of the lever arm. The first state (called here “state I”), observed in the structure of chicken S1 (Rayment et al., 1993a), corresponds to an “open” conformation of the cleft and an orientation of the converter that positions the lever arm in a so-called “down” orientation (at an angle of approximately 45° to the actin filament axis). Structural studies of expressed myosin head constructs in the presence of ADP·Pi or ATP analogs (Fisher et al., 1995; Smith and Rayment, 1996; Dominguez et al., 1998) have revealed a second state (called here “state II”) in which closure of the 50 kDa cleft near the γ-phosphate leads to a distinctive orientation of the converter that positions the lever arm in a so-called “up” or “primed” position (at an angle of approximately 90° to the actin filament axis). State II clearly represents the structure of the head during the transition state of hydrolysis. Since both a nucleotide-free structure (Rayment et al., 1993a) and nucleotide-bound structures (Fisher et al., 1995; Gulick et al., 1997) have been observed in state I, it is still uncertain whether this state corresponds to a conformation of the head prior to hydrolysis (i.e., a weak actin-binding ATP state) (Gulick and Rayment, 1997) or to that at the end of the contractile cycle (i.e., a strong actin-binding state) (Holmes, 1997). Thus, the precise relationship between the different structural states observed so far and their correspondence with specific steps in the enzymatic cycle of ATPase activity has not yet been established.

Moreover, neither of these states accounts for certain significant biochemical data (Goldman, 1998). For example, neither structure reveals how the two sulfhydryls at either end of the so-called SH1 helix can be cross-linked in the presence of ADP (Reisler et al., 1974; Wells and Yount, 1980; Huston et al., 1988). Kinetic studies have also shown that nucleotide binding is a multistep process (Lynn and Taylor, 1971; Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974) accompanied by the disorder of probes in the myosin head (Ostap et al., 1995; Berger et al., 1996). The structural basis for these findings is not yet clear. In order to describe the actomyosin cycle, a model requiring only two conformational states of S1 (one with a high and the other with a low affinity for actin) have been advanced (Holmes, 1997). There is good evidence, however, that the ATP state differs from both the ADP·Pi and the strong actin-binding states and corresponds to a very weak binding state that is sensitive to ionic strength and allows myosin to detach readily from actin (Brenner et al., 1982). According to Gulick and Rayment (1997), at least three states are required: assigning state I as an ATP state, the rigor state would correspond to a somewhat different structure in which the 50 kDa cleft is fully closed.

Here we describe a structure for the scallop myosin head bound to MgADP. Striking features seen in this novel conformational state of myosin (“state III”) are that the SH1 helix is unwound and that a distinctive position of the converter leads to an unusual orientation of the lever arm close to the axis of the actin helix. This structure allows us to account for many previously puzzling properties of the molecule. The structure also reveals the detailed organization of the myosin head more clearly than was possible before. Comparison of the three structural states of myosin allows us to describe here how certain small structural elements in S1 function as “joints” that permit coordinated movement of the major subdomains within the motor domain so that structural transitions of the head occur with different bound nucleotides. We also present arguments that this structure is not, in fact, a strong actin-binding ADP state but may represent one of the ATP states of the molecule.

Note that we have also obtained two other conformational states of scallop S1, albeit at lower (4 Å) resolution (A. H. et al., in preparation). These structures show that scallop S1 adopts a conformation in the absence of

Stereo diagram of the structure of scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (state III) (A) compared to ribbon diagrams of the chicken striated S1 (state I) (B) and the chicken smooth MDE-AlF₄⁻ (state II) (C) structures. The structures are oriented so that the lower 50 kDa subdomains (white) superimpose. Note that the converter (green) and the lever arm (heavy chain, cyan; ELC, pink; RLC, purple) adopt very different positions in the three structures. The four subdomains of the motor domain are labeled, as are three structural elements that articulate movements within the head: switch II (residues Ile461-Asn470, orange); the relay (residues Asn489-Asp515, yellow); and the SH1 helix (Cys693-Phe707, red). The region that is most different among these three structures is the SH3 motif (black). Note that the SH1 helix is unwound in the scallop structure (A). To illustrate the unusual position of the lever arm in this structure (which we believe is not bound to actin), we have included the approximate direction of the actin filament (shown by an arrow), relative to the lower 50 kDa subdomain, deduced from an actomyosin docking model (Whittaker et al., 1995). Note, however, that since both this structure and the pre-power stroke state represent weak actin-binding states, no data are available to describe their interactions with actin. We assume here that the actin filament axis and the lower 50 kDa subdomain would remain in similar relative orientations.

Left, ribbon diagrams of chicken S1 (A), scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (B), and smooth MDE-AlF₄⁻ (C); right, schematic drawing of the subdomains. (The SH3 motif and both light chains are omitted for clarity.) The structures are oriented so that the N-terminal and upper 50 kDa subdomains superimpose. Note the different positions of the lower 50 kDa subdomain and the converter (green). Changes in the orientation of the converter are amplified by the lever arm. The black arrows indicate the direction of movement of the lower 50 kDa subdomain and the converter from that in the chicken S1 structure (A). Movement of the subdomains from one state to another is controlled by coupled conformational changes of the three joints: switch II (orange), the relay (yellow), and the SH1 helix (red).

Small variations in the relative orientation of the light chain lobes are observed but are minimal at the ELC/RLC interface because of the specific binding of a Ca²⁺ ion in the regulatory site.

The converter is a small compact subdomain whose role is to amplify the conformational changes of the motor domain. By comparing three states of myosin, we can now define this region more precisely than previously (Houdusse and Cohen, 1996; Dominguez et al., 1998). Thus, the converter has a conserved overall topology, encompassing residues Phe-707 to Arg-774. The first three turns of the long heavy chain helix (Gly765-Arg774) that extends into the lever arm play an essential role in the internal stabilization of the converter (Figure 3). In all three states, this part of the heavy chain helix is maintained precisely due to strong interactions with the rest of the converter: they include hydrogen bonds between three conserved residues within the myosin superfamily (Arg-719, Tyr-720, and Glu-771) and two large clusters of hydrophobic interactions. Because of these strong and conserved linkages, changes in the orientation of the converter are transmitted to the rest of the long heavy chain helix that forms the backbone of the lever arm.

The interactions between the ELC and the motor domain are potentially a second route for the transmission of structural information between the motor domain and the lever arm. These interactions are, however, limited and differ in the scallop structure, chicken striated S1, and smooth MDE at both the interface with the converter and the N-terminal subdomain (Figure 3). Since the first three turns of the long heavy chain helix are part of the converter, in contrast to the following turns that interact strongly with the ELC (Houdusse and Cohen, 1996), variability of the converter/ELC interface requires differences in the bending of the long heavy chain helix. This hinge occurs at residues Leu778-Lys780. Here the heavy chain helix is almost straight in the scallop structure, but in chicken S1 it is bent by ~30° and in smooth MDE by ~60°, since one turn of the helix is unwound. Because of their amplification by the 85 Å long lever arm, these differences in the interactions of the converter/ELC interface are of significance in the calculation of the step size deduced from different orientations of the converter. These differences may correspond primarily to variations among isoforms and may explain in part differences in the mechanical properties or in the regulation of various myosin isoforms. They also indicate that the converter/lever arm may not move as a rigid body during the contractile cycle. Structural results on the same myosin in different states are essential to establish this point (A. H. et al., in preparation).

Figure 3. The ELC/Converter Interactions Modulate the Position of the Lever Arm

Different positions of the converter in the three states result in major movements of the lever arm (see Figures 1 and 2). This diagram illustrates how the converter and the ELC interact differently in chicken S1 (A), scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (B), and smooth MDE-ALF₄⁻ (C). In this view, the converter (green) and the HP helix (yellow) appear to be in similar positions. Note that differences in the interactions between the C-terminal lobe of the ELC (pink) and the motor domain in these structures result in different bending of the heavy chain helix (cyan) after the first three turns (green) that are part of the converter.

The Four Subdomains within the Motor Domain Are Linked by Three Flexible Joints

Comparison of the three conformational states reveals the organization and articulation of the four major subdomains within the motor domain: the N-terminal, upper 50 kDa and lower 50 kDa subdomains, and the converter (see Figure 2). Conserved secondary and tertiary structures within the subdomains account for their invariance in different states (see Table 2). The positions of the N-terminal and upper 50 kDa subdomains on either side of the nucleotide-binding pocket are also relatively conserved in the three states. In order to superimpose and compare the three conformational states of myosin, we have used 366 equivalent Cα positions in the N-terminal and upper 50 kDa subdomains, excluding the variable loop regions and the SH3 motif. The lower 50 kDa subdomain and the converter adopt markedly different positions in the three states. The amplitude of the movement of these two subdomains from one state to another can be estimated by the average rms deviation of the conserved Cα residues of these subdomains when the structures are superimposed (see Table 2).

The movement of these four subdomains of the motor domain in the transitions from one state to another is brought about by coupled conformational changes of three short structural elements of the myosin head: switch II, an element that we call the "relay," and the SH1 helix (see Figures 1 and 2). These elements—which we call joints—are highly conserved in sequence and located in the core of the myosin head. The relay, comprising the end of the so-called HP helix followed by a loop (residues Asn489–Asp515), is part of the lower 50 kDa subdomain and is located at the interface with the converter. This joint also interacts with the SH1 helix (residues Cys693–Phe707) that connects the N-terminal subdomain and the converter. Switch II(residues Ile461-

The numbers in italics correspond to the rms differences for equivalent Cα positions used to superimpose the subdomains. The numbers in bold correspond to the rms differences for these Cα positions when the structures are superimposed using 366 Cα positions from N-terminal and upper 50 kDa subdomains.

Asn470), whose conformation influences the coordination around the γ-phosphate of the nucleotide, is a linker at the bottom of the 50 kDa cleft that connects the upper and lower 50 kDa subdomains. The joints therefore link all four subdomains of the motor domain and play a critical role in transmitting structural changes within the head. Although the importance of these elements had been recognized earlier in descriptions of the transition from state I to state II in the myosin head (Fisher et al., 1995; Dominguez et al., 1998), this third conformation of the myosin head enables us to analyze more closely their detailed architecture and mechanical properties.

The myosin head appears to be so designed that only the converter is relatively unconstrained, while the other three modules of the motor domain have limitations on their motions. For example, the relative orientations of the N-terminal and upper 50 kDa subdomains are restricted, since they share the central seven-stranded β sheet of the motor domain. Near the actin-binding site, the movement of the upper and lower 50 kDa subdomains is also restricted by a four-residue “strut” (residues Asp600-Asn603) that spans the actin-binding cleft after the HT helix. (Note that the nomenclature for the structural elements of the myosin heavy chain cited in this paper is that used by Cope et al. [1996] to compare with other myosins.) Similarly, two critical elements of secondary structure—an α helix of the lower 50 kDa subdomain and the third strand of the central beta sheet of the N-terminal subdomain—are linked by only two residues: Thr-663 and His-664. These three subdomains are thus constrained in their range of motion. In contrast, the converter is connected to the other subdomains by only two deformable joints (the relay and the SH1 helix) and can therefore greatly amplify small rearrangements within the head.

The Nucleotide-Binding Site Shows that the Third Conformational State of Myosin Is Not an “ADP-Specific” State of the Molecule

The electron density within the nucleotide-binding site clearly confirms that this scallop structure contains Mg²⁺-ADP as well as a few water molecules. The liganding around the Mg²⁺-ADP is the same as that found in all myosin-nucleotide complexes described so far (Fisher et al., 1995). In contrast to the GTP-hydrolyzing G proteins (Vale, 1996), the absence of a γ-phosphate in the scallop structure does not trigger a conformational change in the P loop (residues Gly-176 to Glu-184) or switch I (residues Asn-237 to Gly-244). Two water molecules interact with these loops, as do two oxygens of the γ-phosphate when an ATP analog is bound in Dictyostelium MD structures (Fisher et al., 1995). Similarly, the Dictyostelium MD-ADP structure (which is in state I) contains three water molecules that substitute for all three oxygens of a γ-phosphate (Gulick et al., 1997). Moreover, scallop S1 complexed with the ATP analogs AMPPNP or ADP·BeFx yields crystals with unit cells very similar to that of the crystals of S1 complexed with MgADP, indicating that these structures are similar. An ATP molecule could thus fit into the nucleotide-binding pocket of the scallop structure without requiring any conformational change. These results indicate that the scallop S1 crystals complexed with MgADP do not display an ADP-specific state of myosin.

Lack of Stabilization of Switch II Allows a Novel Open Conformation of the γ-Phosphate Pocket

Comparison of the Dictyostelium MD-BeFx (state I) and MD-VO₄ (state II) structures has shown that a conformational change affecting a highly conserved element near the γ-phosphate—the so-called switch II—plays an important role in closing the 50 kDa cleft and locking the structure in the transition state of hydrolysis (Fisher et al., 1995). Switch II is a linker at the bottom of the 50 kDa cleft that connects the upper and lower 50 kDa subdomains. In the scallop structure, switch II adopts a third conformation that differs from both states I and II because of a different bending of the main chain at residues Ile-461 and Gly-463 (Figure 4). As in state I, the γ-phosphate pocket is open because the first five residues of switch II adopt an extended conformation and are not involved in specific interactions. By contrast, in state II structures, closure of the γ-phosphate pocket is induced by a bent conformation of these residues that form a salt bridge and four hydrogen bonds with the upper 50 kDa subdomain. The HP helix follows switch II in the structure and plays a critical role in allowing the rest of switch II to move as a rigid body (Figure 4). Point mutations in switch II and the HP helix have revealed how important these specific interactions are for proper functioning of the motor (Ruppel and Spudich, 1996). Moreover, the first five turns of the HP helix are involved in numerous conserved interactions with the secondary structural elements of the lower 50 kDa subdomain; this helix thus constitutes an essential internal element of this subdomain. Taken together, the conserved interactions between switch II, the HP helix, and the other elements within the lower 50 kDa subdomain allow the small conformational change at the beginning of switch II to be amplified to produce a movement of the whole lower 50 kDa subdomain.

The Relay Controls the Converter/Lever Arm Position

The last three turns of the long HP helix (residues Asn489-Glu503) and the loop that follows (residues Gly504-Asp515) constitute an elongated extension of the lower 50 kDa subdomain—which we call the relay—that plays a critical role in the transmission of conformational change to the converter. (Note that in Dominguez et al. [1998], which described a transition state structure, this region is referred to as the “rigid relay loop.”) This element at the surface of the molecule is relatively rigid, due for the most part to the unusually stable HP helix that constitutes one of its sides. In all three structural states of a myosin head observed to date, the end of the HP helix and three residues of the loop (residues Glu496-Ala506) interact with the converter in a conserved manner (Figure 5). As a result, conformational changes in the relay play an important role in positioning the converter, thereby directing the movement of the lever arm during the contractile cycle.

In contrast to this highly conserved feature, the residues at the beginning and the end of the relay adopt

Figure 4. Coupling of the Conformational Changes of the J joints in the Three States

Ribbon diagram illustrating the differences in the conformation of the joints in chicken S1 (A), scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (B), and smooth MDE-AlF₄⁻ (C). The N-terminal (gray) and upper 50 kDa (blue) subdomains of these structures (on the right side) superimpose. (Note that here the structures are oriented similarly to those in Figure 2.) Near the nucleotide-binding pocket, changes in the first five residues of switch II (orange) affect the position of the lower 50 kDa subdomain. The rest of switch II is invariant because of interactions with three asparagine residues (purple) of the HP helix (white and yellow). Note that in (C), the HP helix must bend, since the conformation of switch II has positioned the lower 50 kDa subdomain closer to the N-terminal and upper 50 kDa subdomains than in (A) or (B). The SH1 helix is unwound in (B), and the two cysteine residues (black balls) are only 7 Å apart. A small conformational change of switch II positions the lower 50 kDa subdomain ~3 Å “higher” in (B) than in (A) and induces the unwinding of this helix. To estimate the amplitude of this movement, the Cα of Y583 (green ball in [B]) can be compared to that of the equivalent residue of chicken S1 (orange ball) or smooth MDE-AlF₄⁻ (cyan ball). Comparison of the environment of the residues of the bend between the SH2 (pink) and SH1 (red) helices shows that they can interact with switch II in (A) and the β strands of the lower 50 kDa subdomain in (A) and (C), but that none of these interactions can occur in (B). The different conformations of these joints result in very different positions of the converter (e.g., note the β sheet in green).

different conformations in various states of the myosin head, allowing different orientations of the conserved surface that interacts with the converter. The first residues of the relay occur in the middle of the HP helix, and conformational changes here are limited to various bending motions of this helix. Unlike the neighboring SH1 helix (see below), the HP helix does not unwind, since it is stabilized by interactions with the converter as well as with a cluster of hydrophobic interactions around Phe-493 and Phe-512. In structures of states I or III, the loop is less rigid after Trp-507 than the rest of the relay, since it is exposed to the solvent. In state II, however, this region is involved in many interactions with the SH1 helix, and the entire relay is therefore most rigid in this transition state of the myosin head (Dominique et al., 1998).

The tryptophan residue of the relay, Trp-507, is believed to be responsible for the fluorescence enhancement observed during ATP hydrolysis (Hiratsuka, 1992). As shown in Figure 5, the environment of this residue changes in different states of the myosin head and is most hydrophobic in transition state structures. In the scallop structure, the side chain has flipped by ~90°, allowing more interactions with the converter to take place. Some of these interactions involve positively charged residues (Arg-754, Lys-763) of the converter, which may reduce the fluorescence of this residue (Bivin et al., 1993). Trp-507 seems, therefore, to be a particularly good sensor of the conformational state of the myosin head.

The SH1 Helix Is Unwound and May Allow the Lever Arm to Adopt Multiple Conformations

The two most reactive sulfhydryls of the myosin head, Cys-693 (SH2) and Cys-703 (SH1), belong to the so-called SH1 helix region (Cys693-Phe707) that is known to undergo nucleotide-induced conformational changes (Reisler et al., 1974; Wells and Yount, 1980; Huston et al., 1988). This 15 residue-long region links the N-terminal subdomain to the converter and constitutes a third joint in the myosin head. Changes in its conformation enable the converter to adopt various orientations during the contractile cycle. Residues Gly695-Gly706 are helical in structures of both states I and II, but in the scallop structure, part of this region (residues 696–703) is disordered (Figure 4). The relative positions of Gly-695 and Gly-706 indicate that the SH1 helix is, in fact, unwound in this structure. The two reactive sulfhydryls SH1 and SH2 are ~18 Å apart in structures of states I or II and cannot be cross-linked, since they face opposite sides.

Ribbon diagram of the interface between the relay (yellow) and the converter ($\beta$ sheet and last helix in green) in chicken S1 (A), scallop S1 complexed with MgADP (B), and smooth MDE-AlF${}_{4}^{-}$ (C) oriented so that the converters superimpose. Note that the orientation of the last three turns of the HP helix (yellow) is similar in all these structures, since three glutamate residues of this helix (brown) interact with residues of the converter (cyan) in all three states. In contrast, the conformation of the loop of the relay (yellow) is very different and is most rigid in (C) where it interacts with the SH1 helix (red). Conformational changes at both ends of the relay allow the orientation of the lower 50 kDa subdomain (white, HP and HQ helices) to differ with respect to that of the converter in these three states. Note also how the environment around the tryptophan residue (blue) of the relay varies in the three states.

of the SH1 helix. In the scallop structure, however, these two sulfhydryls are only $\sim$7 Å apart. This structure thus explains at long last how cross-linkers can react with both cysteine residues in the presence of nucleotides.

Mutation studies have shown that for proper functioning, myosin requires two highly conserved glycines located at either end of the SH1 helix (Gly-695 and Gly-706, scallop sequence) (Kinose et al., 1996; Patterson et al., 1997). Comparison of the structures of states I and II shows that bending of the peptide chain at these glycine residues allows a rotation of the SH1 helix that is essential for the movement of the converter (Dominquez et al., 1998). In these structures, these glycines adopt Ramachandran angles that are permissible for all residues. But in the mutant myosins, this region would probably be disturbed, since the mutant side chains, which are sequestered in rather confined cavities, would cause steric hindrance. In the scallop S1 structure with bound MgADP, the second glycine (Gly-706) adopts Ramachandran angles disallowed for all amino acid residues but glycine and is thus critical to orient the converter in its new location. Flexibility from another glycine residue (Gly-699) located in the middle of the SH1 helix might promote the unwinding of the helix.

Study of the environment of the SH1 helix in the three structural states of the head indicates why this joint displays a major change in conformation in the scallop structure. This element, situated at the periphery of the

N-terminal subdomain, fits into a kind of cavity between this subdomain on one side and the relay on the other (see Figure 4). The size and shape of the cavity depends strongly on the relative positions of the lower 50 kDa and N-terminal subdomains. In states I and II, the cavity is filled by the helix, which makes van der Waals contacts—but no specific interactions—along its length. The end of the helix is involved in few specific interactions, but these vary in the two states. Overall, the SH1 helix is marginally stable in these structures. It can therefore undergo modest conformational changes such as the rotation by about $10^{\circ}$ between states I and II. The last residues of the SH1 helix lead directly to the converter, which is held in position by strong linkages to the relay. Any conformational changes of the relay and the SH1 helix must therefore be coupled so that both maintain strong linkages with the converter. Since the relay also plays a role in stabilizing the SH1 helix on one side, a change in its location that separates these two joints can produce a major destabilization and unwinding of the helix, as seen in the scallop structure.

There is also a direct connection between the conformation of switch II and the precise position of the relay, since a major role of switch II is to control the location of the lower 50 kDa subdomain. Moreover, a few residues of the lower 50 kDa subdomain are directly involved in the stabilization of the short region where a bend occurs between the SH2 and SH1 helices (residues
Cys-693, Asn-694, Gly-695) (Figure 4). In state II structures, closure of the 50 kDa cleft near the nucleotide-binding site brings the lower 50 kDa and the N-terminal subdomains closer together than in state I and strengthens the contacts at the region of the bend between the SH1 and SH2 helices. In this state, to avoid steric hindrance between the SH1 helix and the HP helix of the relay, both joints must change conformation. A rotation of the SH1 helix and a reorientation of the relay not only enhances the stability of the SH1 helix but preserves as well the linkages that both joints make with the converter (see Figure 4). The conformation of switch II thus triggers conformational changes in the other two joints that result in an orientation for the converter that is specific for the transition state.

In the scallop structure, switch II adopts a third conformation (somewhat similar to that in state I) that partially closes the 50 kDa cleft near the actin-binding site but not near the nucleotide-binding site. This conformation results in a separation of the lower 50 kDa and N-terminal subdomains (see Figure 4B). The residues that form the region of the bend between the SH1 and SH2 helices can therefore no longer interact with the lower 50 kDa subdomain, and the cavity for the SH1 helix near the relay is wider in this state than in the others. Thus, loss of stabilizing contacts results in the unwinding of the SH1 helix and the last turn of the SH2 helix. The converter then cannot be held as firmly as in the other states, resulting in variability in the orientation of the lever arm with respect to the motor domain. Lack of stabilization of switch II can thus lead to a small conformational change of this joint that triggers the unwinding of the SH1 helix between states I and III.

### Discussion

#### Unwinding of the SH1 Helix Indicates that the Novel Structure Binds Actin Weakly and Corresponds to an ATP State

A number of compelling arguments indicate that this unusual structure, characterized by the unwinding of the SH1 helix, is not a strong actin-binding “ADP” state but corresponds to a weak actin-binding state of the molecule. Cross-linking experiments have established that the binding of ADP in the myosin head induces flexibility in the SH1 helix (Reisler et al., 1974; Wells and Yount, 1980; Huston et al., 1988; Liang and Spudich, 1998). More recent kinetic studies have shown that flexibility in the SH1 helix region can be induced by ATP analogs and that actin prevents cross-linking (Nitao and Reisler, 1998). Moreover, once cross-linked by p-PDM, S1-ADP can no longer bind strongly to actin filaments (Chalovich et al., 1983). These findings indicate that this structure, in which the SH1 helix is unwound, cannot correspond to the strong actin-binding “ADP state” of the contractile cycle.

The unusual structural features of this scallop state support these biochemical results. At present, this myosin structure is the only one yet determined in which the SH1 helix is unwound. This feature signifies that in this structure the subdomains are loosely coupled, in contrast to the pre-powerstroke (state III) or near-rigor (state

I)structures where the S1 head is relatively rigid because of subdomain interactions. This uncoupling and the resulting increased mobility of the lever arm are incompatible with a post-power stroke S1-ADP state that binds actin strongly. Correspondingly, crystals of scallop S1 bound to the ATP analogs AMPPNP or ADP·BeFx, which have unit cells similar to those of the S1-ADP crystals, have been obtained, indicating that these structures are similar. No crystals, however, were obtained under similar ionic conditions for scallop S1-ADP·Pi analogs (S1-ADP·VO₄ or S1-ADP·AlF₄⁻) or for scallop S1 in the absence of nucleotide. Based on these considerations, we believe that the scallop state III structure represents an ATP state of the molecule. Additional experimental evidence to test this interpretation should come from crystals of p-PDM cross-linked S1, which are now in hand.

#### A Picture for Strong Actin-Binding States

The three states of myosin observed to date cannot correspond precisely to that of the strong actin-binding states of the head at the end of the power stroke, since they all can be induced by the binding of ATP analogs. Myosin bound tightly to actin adopts a rather rigid structure characterized by a lever arm in the ~45° orientation (Rayment et al., 1993b) and, based on cross-linking results, probably by an intact SH1 helix. Thus, little mobility has been observed for probes bound to SH1 in a nucleotide-free or ADP state of actomyosin (Grinband et al., 1998), and SH1–SH2 cross-linking is also inhibited in these states (Nitao and Reisler, 1998a). A key unknown, however, is which conformation of switch II in this rigid state would position the lower and upper 50 kDa subdomains so that most subsites can participate in actin binding. To account for the strong actin-binding states, a model in which the 50 kDa cleft is completely closed has been proposed previously, since the chicken S1 structure was identified as a weak actin-binding ATP state (Gulick and Rayment, 1997). Our results show, however, that state III in scallop S1 can account for many properties of the ATP state (see below). The chicken S1 structure might in fact be marginally stable in the presence of nucleotide, since a small conformational change of switch II can produce the unwinding of the SH1 helix. Moreover, this structure has many features of the hypothetical state that would bind strongly to actin—such as the ~45° orientation of the lever arm, the presence of an intact SH1 helix, and an open 50 kDa cleft that can promote the release of phosphate. An alternative model for the strong actin-binding states of myosin might therefore be a structure similar to that of chicken S1, with an open cleft, but differing from it mainly by its higher degree of stability. Stabilization of the head in the nucleotide-free state could result from the interactions of switch II with surrounding loops such as that of switch I, whose conformation could readily change when the nucleotide is not bound. Consistent with this picture is the fact that in the absence of actin, lack of nucleotide is sufficient to enhance the stability of the SH1 helix, whereas ADP promotes its unwinding. In the actomyosin cycle, the myosin head would be rather rigid in the ADP state because strong binding to actin at
the end of the power stroke would stabilize, say, an extended conformation of switch II that prevents the unwinding of the SH1 helix. After release of ADP, small rearrangements (possibly within the upper 50 kDa and N-terminal subdomains) could further increase the stability of the myosin head in this strong binding conformation. In the case of vertebrate smooth muscle, larger rearrangements would take place, since a lever arm movement has been observed (Whittaker et al., 1995).

### Weak Binding States of the Actomyosin Cycle: How Myosin May Detach from Actin

There are good reasons to believe that this scallop structure (state III) is part of the actomyosin cycle and corresponds, as described above, not to an ADP but an ATP state. Myosin heads are dissociated from actin for a considerable portion of the ATPase cycle (Linari et al., 1998), and the hydrolysis step contributes at least part of the cycle time (White et al., 1997). Although there is as yet no strong evidence that the unwinding of the SH1 helix is critical for detachment of myosin heads, a number of observations can be accounted for on this basis. Thus, the internal mobility of the SH1 region in this structure explains the disorder of SH1 probes observed by fluorescence polarization (Berger et al., 1996) and EPR (Ostap et al., 1995) studies in skinned fibers. The apparent rate of ATP hydrolysis in detached heads might in fact be determined by the time required to reform the helix in the conformational change between states III and II. In our view, lack of constraints on the conformation of switch II in the “ATP” state could lead to different relative positions of the upper and lower 50 kDa subdomains, some of which could promote the unwinding of the SH1 helix and the low actin affinity.

On this basis, we can attempt to picture where this ATP state might fit into the actomyosin cycle. The ATP state in myosin consists in fact of a number of substates (Lymn and Taylor, 1971; Bagshaw and Trentham, 1974). Starting with a true rigor state, binding of ATP would produce a transient ATP state, similar to that of chicken S1, in which switch II is extended and unstabilized. This state would be followed by the longer-lived state III, in which ATP is trapped and the lever arm assumes a new position. Finally, the reformation of the SH1 helix would lead to state II, where the lever arm is primed (Dominquez et al., 1998; Suzuki et al., 1998), followed by rapid hydrolysis. Note that a movement of the lever arm has recently been detected between two ATP states of myosin preceding ATP hydrolysis (Suzuki et al., 1998) and supports this sequence of events upon ATP binding. Consistent with this view is the fact that ATP analogs can induce all three states and that a small conformational change of switch II can easily promote the transition between near-rigor (state I) and this structure (state III). Unwinding of the helix in state III may thus play an important role in enhancing the lifetime of this state and in increasing the population of detached heads in muscle fibers.

---

The nucleotide-binding site and the actin-binding interface are two key regions on the myosin head whose

state controls the relative positions of the major subdomains. We consider first the detached states, for which we have experimental data, and examine the structural effects of the conformation and degree of stabilization of switch II. We have identified the scallop state III structure as one of a number of possible ATP states, since the residues of switch I and the P loop are in a position where they can ligand the γ-phosphate of an ATP molecule. In such ATP states (including, in our view, that found in the chicken S1 structure), the first five residues of switch II are both extended and unstabilized and do not participate in the binding of the γ-phosphate. Correspondingly, the other two joints are flexible as well and the subdomains are relatively independent. This is a true “relaxed” state. In order for hydrolysis to occur, the first five residues of switch II must interact with the upper 50 kDa subdomain to close the γ-phosphate pocket. Switch II is now in a bent and rigid conformation. These rearrangements result in the close approach of the N-terminal and lower 50 kDa subdomains so that the HP helix of the relay must bend and interact strongly with the SH1 helix. In this transition state, these joints act together to produce a position of the converter that results in an up or primed position for the lever arm. This conformation is characterized by a rigid state of all joints and close interactions of the subdomains. Since the phosphate is trapped, the head is now locked in the pre-power stroke state. Weak rebinding to actin is quickly followed by repositioning of the upper and lower 50 kDa subdomains to generate the strong actin-binding interface. The transition between these two relatively rigid states generates the power stroke and promotes the release of phosphate.

We can now extend these ideas to consider in a general way possible conformational changes of the head in the strong binding states. The key feature that is known is the 45° position for the lever arm. This orientation immediately positions the converter, the relay, and the SH1 helix that would adopt conformations similar to those found in the chicken S1 structure. We cannot describe, however, the conformation of switch II in this rigid state, since we do not yet know how actin binding affects the cleft that is spanned at the base by switch II. As discussed above, there would be a difference, however, in the stabilization of switch II in an ADP-compared with a nucleotide-free head. In the former case, constraints on the positioning of the subdomains would arise mainly from the binding to actin, since the loops near the nucleotide are binding ADP. In the absence of nucleotide, rearrangements near the nucleotide-binding site could provide new linkages to further stabilize the head. Rebinding of ATP would disrupt these linkages, leading to a flexibility of switch II. The weak coupling in the ATP state of the head would affect both the actin-binding interface and the orientation of the lever arm and so promote the dissociation of the motor from actin. Thus, the motor would be primed only when detached from actin, preventing the possibility of a reverse power stroke.

### Perspective

This novel structure is a key that helps us to interpret a number of hitherto puzzling properties of the myosin
motor. We can now understand how three small structural elements of the head, which change conformation depending on bound nucleotides, can produce rearrangements of the four subdomains of the motor. The structure also suggests that unwinding of the SH1 helix may play a role in the multiple step process of nucleotide binding in myosin. A number of previous studies have been carried out using cross-linked S1 (p-PDM S1), since it is an immobilized state of the molecule. Now that we recognize that this cross-linked S1 is probably an ATP state that binds actin very weakly, interpretation of results on both actomyosin interactions (Van Dijk et al., 1998) and thin filament regulation (Chalovich et al., 1983) can be clarified. The unwinding of the SH1 helix also explains why adding ADP to myosin may not always produce a state that binds strongly to actin. This ATP state may play an important role in keeping the heads detached from actin. Further studies of mutant myosins in which unwinding of the SH1 helix is prevented are critical in order to assess the physiological significance of this state.

### Experimental Procedures

#### Crystallization, Data Collection, and Processing
S1 from scallop (*Argopecten irradians*) striated muscle myosin was obtained as described previously (Kalabokis and Szent-Györgyi, 1997), with the following modifications. Myosin was digested for 8 min at \(20^\circ \mathrm{C}\) at a w/w ratio of myosin to papain of 2500. Solutions for reactive red chromatography contained \(0.5 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{ADP}\). Crystals of S1 complexed with MgADP were obtained at \(4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\) by microseeding sitting drops that contained a mixture of \(3 \%\) polyethylene glycol 20,000, \(50 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{Tris}\) (pH 8.0), \(6 \%\) glycerol, \(40 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{NaCl}, 10 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{ml}\) of S1, and \(2 \mathrm{~mm} \mathrm{MgADP}\). The crystals, of typical dimensions \(0.2 \times 0.2 \times 0.4 \mathrm{~mm}\), belong to the P1 space group and contain one molecule per unit cell with \(64.6 \%\) solvent. Using \(25 \%\) glycerol as a cryoprotectant, a data set was collected from one of these crystals to a nominal resolution of \(2.5 \AA\) at \(100 \mathrm{~K}\) (CHESS beamline F1, \(\lambda=0.90 \AA\)). Data were collected at high resolution for two different orientations of the crystal, and a faster collection of the low-resolution data was performed to limit overloads and increase the multiplicity. The data set was indexed with DENZO (Otwinowski and Minor, 1993) and scaled with the SCALA program (Evans, 1993) and the MASSAGE suite (N. Volkmann, personal communication) (Table 1).

#### Structure Determination Refinement and Model Quality
The molecular replacement solution was found with the program AMoRe (Navaza, 1994). Both the *Dictyostelium* MD-BeF<sub>x</sub> (PDB code: 1MMD) and scallop RD (PDB code: 1WDC) structures were used as search models. Note that both the SH3 motif and the converter were removed from the initial model, whose R factor was \(41.8 \%\) at \(3.0 \AA\) resolution. The crystal packing accounts for the anisotropy of the diffraction data: the highest resolution diffraction (\(2.5 \AA\)) is observed along the c axis that corresponds approximately to the length of the molecule. In the ab plane, the lever arm is involved in very few contacts, and data to \(2.8 \AA\) are observed along the b axis and to \(3.0 \AA\) along the a axis (see Table 1). The structure was refined with the program X-PLOR (Brünger, 1992) using a bulk solvent correction. Model building was performed using the program O (Jones et al., 1991). The present model for the scallop S1 complexed with MgADP has a number of breaks in the chain trace, corresponding to loop regions exposed to the solvent. Also, eight residues of the SH1 helix region were not modeled because of their flexibility in this structure. The final refinement converged to an R factor of \(22.4 \%\) and R<sup>free</sup> of \(29.7 \%\) and good stereochemistry as judged by the programs PROCHECK (Laskowski et al., 1993) and X-PLOR (Table 1). Note that the average B factor for the residues of the lever arm are greater than those of the motor domain, since most of the lever arm is exposed to the solvent and relatively unconstrained.
