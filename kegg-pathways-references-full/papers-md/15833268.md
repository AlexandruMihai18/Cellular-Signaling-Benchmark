& Sigmund, 2004), the net therapeutic effect of ACE inhibitors may reflect both diminished Ang II and increased bradykinin levels. In addition, the tetrapeptide N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline (AcSDKP), which is normally present in mammalian plasma and many tissues, is hydrolyzed almost exclusively by ACE (Azizi, Junot, E
upregulation of ACE2 may play a protective role in the heart. Increased ACE2 activity may function to oppose increases in cardiac Ang II levels. Evidence is available that Ang 1–7, besides causing vasodilation, counteracts the growth-promoting and fibrotic effects of Ang II (Ferrario, Chappell, Tallant, Brosnihan, & Diz, 1997
al., 2003). These findings were interpreted to mean that the non-signaling receptor stabilizes interaction of the ligand-occupied receptor with its G protein, thereby permitting the latter's coupling and signaling. Based on these findings, it was speculated that the AT₁ and β-adrenergic receptors of cardiac myocytes may be mutually responsible for initiating the two principal signaling systems that have been implicated in cardiac hypert
couples to downstream kinases, such as Src, ERKs, ASK1, and JNK3, possibly independent of G-protein coupling (Booz & Baker, 2004; Seta, Nanamori, Modrall, Neubig, & Sadoshima, 2002).

A recent study provides evidence that AT₁ can function independently of Ang II as
II has been localized by immunocytochemistry to nuclei in cerebellar neurons and transcriptionally active euchromatin in granule and endothelial cells ([Erdmann, Fuxe, & Ganten, 1996](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02385436)).

Intracellular Ang II could theoretically come from AT₁-mediated internal
