## INTRODUCTION

Salivary glands are composed of highly differentiated epithelial cells and are capable of secreting copious amounts of fluid and exocrine proteins with quite specialized intraoral functions. These glands consist of two distinct functional and anatomic regions, acinar and ductal (FIGURE 1). The acinar region, or secretory endpiece, typically consists of one or (at most) two cell types. It is the site of (i) all fluid generation and (ii) most (~85%) exocrine protein secretion in the gland.¹ The fluid component is derived from the local vascular bed in the form of an isotonic (i.e., ~140 mequiv/L NaCl) “primary” secretion into the acinar lumen. This primary fluid is carried via the duct system (4–5 distinct cell types) into the mouth. In this regard, it is important to emphasize that acinar cells are water-permeable, whereas ductal cells are water-impermeable. As the forming saliva traverses the ductal region, considerable electrolyte flux occurs. Most Na⁺ and Cl⁻ are reabsorbed and a small amount of K⁺ and HCO₃⁻ are secreted. Furthermore, some proteins are added as well. By the time the final saliva enters the mouth, it is markedly hypotonic (~25 mequiv/L NaCl).¹,²

All secretion from human salivary glands occurs in response to neurotransmitter stimulation.³,⁴ There is no spontaneous secretion. Glands are innervated by both sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves. Generally, it is considered that sympathetic stimulation (via norepinephrine, NE) leads to high levels of protein secretion, whereas high rates of fluid output occur in response to parasympathetic stimulation (via acetylcholine, ACh). Autonomic nerves are adjacent to both acinar and ductal cells, suggesting that they may have a role in regulating functional responses in all salivary cell types. Most studies of neurotransmitter control in salivary glands, however, have focused on acinar cells, although ample data exist to demonstrate regulation in several different ductal cells.⁵⁻⁷ This review will focus on the major features of how an acinar cell responds to neurotransmitter stimuli, that is, events that eventually lead to the formation of the primary saliva.

Acinar cells are highly polarized (FIGURE 2), surrounded by a plasma membrane with two general domains, basolateral and apical, that are separated by the tight junctions that link adjacent cells just below the luminal area.⁸ It is generally considered that neurotransmitters, released in response to secretory stimuli, will bind to specific receptor proteins on the basolateral membrane. Thus, NE, which possesses intrinsic α- and β-adrenergic activity, will bind to either α- or β-adrenergic receptors (α-AR, β-AR), whereas ACh will bind to muscarinic cholinergic receptors (mAChRs). These receptors belong to the large family of membrane receptors that

FIGURE 1. Schematic depiction of saliva formation. Saliva formation occurs in two stages. The first takes place in the acinar region and is the generation of an isotonic primary fluid rich in exocrine proteins. The second stage occurs during passage of this fluid through the ductal region. This stage includes considerable electrolyte flux (reabsorption of most Na⁺ and Cl⁻; secretion of some K⁺ and HCO₃⁻). A small amount of protein is also secreted by duct cells. The final saliva, entering the mouth, is markedly hypotonic. It is considered that acinar cells are water-permeable, whereas ductal cells are water-impermeable, although the biologic basis of this phenomenon is not known.

transduce their signals via a guanine nucleotide binding regulatory protein (G protein).<sup>9</sup> This family includes other neurotransmitter receptors (e.g., for dopamine, substance P), as well as receptors for prostaglandins, and many peptide hormones (e.g., vasopressin, parathyroid hormone). Within each receptor type, different sub-species have been identified. The best-studied acinar cells are those of the rat parotid gland. They appear to possess at least two subtypes of α-ARs (α₁, α₂; note the α₂ may actually represent a distinct receptor type) and β-ARs (β₁, β₂), but only one subtype of mAChR (m₃).<sup>4,10</sup>

As mentioned earlier, the neurotransmitter stimulus (first signal to the cell) is conveyed inside the cell via G proteins. These are heterotrimeric molecules that consist of three distinct subunits termed α, β, and γ subunits. About 20 unique genes encoding α subunits have been identified in eukaryotes,<sup>11</sup> whereas at least 4 unique genes exist for both the β and γ subunits.<sup>12</sup> The α subunit is the site of guanine nucleotide binding (at rest, a molecule of GDP) and has generally been considered the subunit type that conveys the functional specificity to a G protein.<sup>13</sup> When a neurotransmitter binds to a receptor, the ability of the receptor to associate with a G protein is markedly increased. This association stimulates the replacement of GDP by GTP at the nucleotide binding site and promotes the dissociation of the heterotrimer into a free α subunit and a βγ complex.

Classically, the α subunit is then available to activate the appropriate effector molecule (e.g., an enzyme like adenylyl cyclase or phospholipase C or an ion channel). This activation continues until the GTP is degraded to GDP by an endogenous GTPase activity within the α subunit. The GDP-bound α subunit then reassociates with the βγ complex to regenerate the inactive heterotrimer molecule. Recently, strong evidence has been presented to suggest that the βγ complex (or the β subunit alone) may be capable of coupling to, and activating directly, certain effector molecules.<sup>14</sup> The two best-studied signal transduction processes in salivary glands are (i) the generation of cAMP following β-AR stimulation, which leads to protein exocytosis, and (ii) the formation of 1,4,5-inositol trisphosphate (IP₃) after mAChR stimulation, which leads to Ca²⁺ mobilization and, subsequently, fluid secretion.

Although it has been recognized for more than 20 years that cAMP is “involved” in protein exocytosis,<sup>15–19</sup> the specific mechanism utilized remains an enigma. The characteristic way by which cAMP elicits a response is via activation of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (A kinase) and a protein phosphorylation event.<sup>20</sup> Considerable study of these steps has occurred in both the rat parotid and submandibular glands.<sup>21–24</sup> β-AR stimulation leads to increases in cAMP levels, activation of the A kinase, phosphorylation (or dephosphorylation) of several cellular proteins, and amylase (parotid) and glycoprotein (submandibular) secretion. Moreover, treatment of rat parotid or submandibular cells with analogues of cAMP will also lead to protein secretion.<sup>25,26</sup> Of the three most frequently reported phosphorylated proteins (34–36 kDa; 24–26 kDa; 22 kDa), the 24–26 kDa species appears to be most likely involved in exocytosis based on kinetic analyses.<sup>24,27</sup> Recently, this protein was purified, although its function (and thus role in exocytosis) is unknown.<sup>27</sup> However, studies by Takuma<sup>28,29</sup> have complicated this story. Using various types of protein kinase and phosphatase inhibitors, Takuma has suggested that there is no direct role for A kinase–dependent protein phosphorylation in rat parotid gland
protein secretion. Thus, at this stage, it seems that cAMP is an intermediate in exocrine secretion, but the exact nature of the way by which cAMP is involved in exocytosis from salivary glands remains a mystery.

The stimulation of acinar cell mAChRs leads to high levels of fluid secretion. It has been recognized for close to 30 years that Ca²⁺ plays a central role in this process.³⁰ In the last ~10 years, there has been considerable study of Ca²⁺ mobilization by acinar cells. This has yielded a fairly good understanding of the mechanistic events involved in this process. Following ACh activation of the mAChRs, fluid-related signal transduction is accomplished via coupling to a G protein that has been “generally” designated as Gp. Detailed characteristics of this G protein have not yet been reported, although it is known to be pertussis toxin–insensitive³¹ and is likely a member of the Gq/11 family known to couple to phospholipase C (PLC).¹¹ The stimulation of PLC results in the hydrolysis of a minor membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate, leading to the formation of two second messengers, IP₃ and diacylglycerol (DAG). DAG can promote activation of protein kinase C and can lead to stimulation of a minor exocytic pathway (FIGURE 2). However, it is IP₃ that plays a key role in Ca²⁺ mobilization and, thus, fluid secretion.³²

IP₃ binds to a receptor protein located on an intracellular Ca²⁺ storage pool (likely a part of, or related to, the endoplasmic reticulum). This IP₃ receptor also functions as a Ca²⁺ release channel, allowing stored Ca²⁺ to move down a concentration gradient into the cytoplasm. Normally, cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ levels ([Ca²⁺]i) are ~50–100 nM. These [Ca²⁺]i levels increase ~10-fold within ~5 s following mAChR stimulation. In effect, this is a priming reaction, initiating a cascade of events including sustained Ca²⁺ entry and the activation of specific ion transport pathways. This finally results in the generation of the primary salivary fluid in the acinar lumen. The latter events are described in detail by Turner in this volume.³³ Remaining emphasis here will focus on what is known about the sustained Ca²⁺ entry process.

Based on the work of Douglas and Poisner,³⁰ it has been long appreciated that it is the presence of extracellular Ca²⁺, that is, Ca²⁺ entry, that sustains high levels of salivary fluid secretion for extended time periods. Ca²⁺ entry into excitable cells (voltage-activated) has been well described and often studied. Ca²⁺ entry into nonexcitable cells, like salivary acinar cells, is not voltage-activated and is not well understood.³⁴ Several possible mechanisms for Ca²⁺ entry have been investigated in acinar cells, including a direct receptor-gated Ca²⁺ channel, a G protein–activated Ca²⁺ channel, and a second messenger–activated Ca²⁺ channel.³⁵ Available evidence suggests no role for either of the first two pathways in acinar cell Ca²⁺ entry. A few reports have suggested that Ca²⁺ entry may be activated by the synergistic action of IP₃ and its metabolite, 1,3,4,5-inositol tetrakisphosphate (IP₄).³⁶

The mechanism that currently is most favored as being best able to explain available data is one termed “capacitative Ca²⁺ entry”.³⁷ This suggests that it is the depletion of the intracellular Ca²⁺ storage pool that provides the driving force for sustained Ca²⁺ entry. A number of different kinds of experiments have supported this view. Of particular note are studies that have caused graded depletion of this Ca²⁺ store, resulting in similarly graded rates of Ca²⁺ entry,³⁸ and use of a nonreceptor activation method to deplete the intracellular Ca²⁺ store (e.g., thapsigargin) and thus stimulate the Ca²⁺ entry process.³⁹ Although we still do not know the exact
mechanism by which store depletion causes Ca²⁺ entry or the exact nature of the Ca²⁺ entry pathway, we do know that it can be modulated by membrane potential, extracellular pH, and [Ca²⁺].³⁵,⁴⁰

It has been the purpose of this report to provide an overview of the signaling events that lead to salivary secretion. It should be emphasized that much of the basis for our understanding of salivary secretion today derives from studies with rat salivary glands. There has been little study with human acinar cells. Although human data are limited, those that exist generally conform to the broad principles described herein. Importantly, it should be apparent to the reader that salivary constituents (fluid, electrolytes, proteins) are found in saliva due to specific, tightly regulated processes. Very little material appears to enter saliva “accidentally” or by leakage, although this is clearly an accepted (but unclear) explanation for the trace presence of several serum proteins in salivary secretions. As noted earlier, all secretion from acinar cells in these glands requires neurotransmitter stimulation to activate the signaling events that result in saliva formation. It should be appreciated that such stimulation also affects many other acinar cell functions including intermediary metabolism,⁴¹ protein synthesis,⁴² secretory protein N-glycosylation,⁴³ and membrane transport protein activity.⁴⁴ Conceivably, and appropriate for consideration at this conference, such broad responsiveness could influence the movement of many compounds from the blood into saliva.
