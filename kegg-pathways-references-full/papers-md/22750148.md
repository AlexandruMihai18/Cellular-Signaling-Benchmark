## ABSTRACT

The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved mediator of growth control, cell fate decisions and stem cell identity. At the heart of the pathway is a kinase cascade that is reminiscent of other signaling pathways, but recent studies indicate that the Hippo pathway is unique in that it is regulated by cellular architecture and the mechanical properties of the environment. The Hippo pathway may thus serve as a sensor of tissue structure and mechanical tension, integrating information regarding the size and shape of an organ into cellular behavior, such as whether or not to proliferate. In this review we summarize recent discoveries regarding the regulation of the Hippo pathway by cellular polarity, cell junctions, and the cytoskeleton and discuss how these data inform the study of development and disease.

1. Introduction

Cells are exposed to many kinds of extracellular signals which modulate a cell’s behavior. Past studies focused mainly on understanding chemical signals, especially in the context of cell–cell interactions. These studies were highly fruitful and identified a handful of signaling pathways that regulate cell fate, cell proliferation, and cell morphology during development and homeostasis [1]. Among these signaling pathways is the Hippo pathway, a relatively recently discovered conserved signal transduction pathway [2–4]. The Hippo pathway is a key regulator of tissue growth, stem cell pluripotency, and cell fate decisions, and de-regulation of Hippo signaling has been implicated in cancer [2,3,5,6]. Because Hippo signaling is a key regulator of growth, a great deal of interest and work is invested in identifying upstream regulators of the pathway. Interestingly, recent work showed that the Hippo pathway is regulated by cell morphology, the cytoskeleton, and mechanical signals. An understanding of how the Hippo pathway is regulated may thus provide information regarding how tissues monitor their integrity and size, and convey that information to cells to regulate growth and patterning.

The Hippo pathway was discovered through genetic screens in Drosophila intended to identify genes required for the regulation of organ size, specifically adult structures derived from imaginal discs [2,3,6]. These screens identified mutations that resulted in dramatic overgrowth of the mutant tissues due to hyper-proliferation and decreased apoptosis of mutant cells. The first mutations identified from these screens disrupted three genes, named *warts* (*wts*), *salvador* (*sav*), and *hippo* (*hpo*) [7–15]. Since then, many additional components of the Hippo pathway have been identified and a complex signaling network has emerged (Fig. 1). Most components of the Hippo pathway are conserved between flies and vertebrates, although some differences exist [2,4,5]. At the core of the pathway is a kinase cascade comprised of the Hpo kinase (MST1/2 in vertebrates) that, along with its co-factor Sav (SAV or WW45 in vertebrates), binds and phosphorylates the serine threonine kinase Wts (LATS1/2 in vertebrates) [7–15]. Activated Wts operates with its co-factor Mats (Mob as tumor suppressor; MOBKL1A/B in vertebrates) to phosphorylate the transcriptional co-activator Yorkie (Yki; YAP and TAZ in vertebrates) [16–22]. When Yki, YAP, or TAZ are phosphorylated, they are inactive and retained in the cytoplasm. Un-phosphorylated Yki, YAP, or TAZ enter the nucleus and interact with transcription factors, including Scalloped (Sd, TEAD1-4 in vertebrates), Homothorax, Teashirt, and Mothers against dpp (Mad), to regulate transcription of downstream target genes [23–31]. Thus, when the Hpo/MST1/2 and Wts/LATS1/2 kinases are active, they suppress growth by inhibiting the activity of Yki/YAP/TAZ.

As upstream components of the Hippo pathway were identified, many had something unexpected in common: roles in maintenance of cellular architecture, such as cell polarity and the cytoskeleton [3,32]. Notably, YAP/TAZ activity is also affected by cell geometry and matrix rigidity [33,34]. Together, these findings suggest that Hippo signaling is responsive to mechanical signals and the presence of neighboring cells. Such cues may take the form of mechanical forces transmitted through cell junctions, either by the cytoskeleton or other mechanisms. This unconventional regulation of a signal transduction pathway, the dramatic phenotypes of pathway mutants, as well as the relationship to organ growth control and cancer, have made investigation of the Hippo pathway a major area of current research. In this article we first discuss how determinants of apical-basal polarity affect Hippo signaling, examining the role that different domains of the cell membrane play in organizing and regulating pathway components. Then we describe data that identify mechanical forces and the cytoskeleton as regulators of Hippo pathway activity. We discuss a role for

Hippo signaling as a transducer of information regarding the physical environment and mechanical conformation of cells. Finally, we integrate this information into a model for the role of the Hippo pathway as a sensor for cellular integrity, social cues, and tissue status.

2. Apical-basal cell polarity complexes and the Hippo pathway

Recent studies showed that cell polarity is a major regulator of the Hippo pathway, with multiple inputs into Hippo signaling. In this section we describe the three major conserved signaling modules that regulate apical-basal polarity and their interactions with the Hippo pathway.

The three major polarity modules: the Crumbs complex, the atypical protein kinase C (aPKC) complex, and the Scribble module, establish the formation of apical-basal polarity in epithelial cells through antagonistic interactions with one another [35]. The Crumbs complex localizes to the apical region of cells, just above the adherens junction (AJ) [35]. Crumbs (Crb), a large transmembrane protein with a small intracellular domain, has three vertebrate homologs (CRB1-3), and forms a complex with the adaptor proteins Stardust (PALS1,2 proteins in mammals) and PALS1 associated tight junction protein (Patj) [35–37]. The aPKC complex, which is also apically localized, includes the Par3 and Par6 PDZ-binding proteins (Bazooka and Par6 in *Drosophila*) in addition to aPKC [35–37]. The apical complexes antagonize the activity of the Scribble polarity module, which consists of the Scribble (Scrib), Discs large (Dlg), and Lethal giant larvae (Lgl) scaffold proteins localized to the basolateral domain [35–37]. Thus, subdivision of the plasma membrane into distinct domains occurs through cross-regulatory interactions between three conserved polarity modules, although the precise molecular mechanisms of these interactions are poorly understood [35–37].

In the following paragraphs we discuss how the apical domain of epithelial cells may be a key location where Hippo pathway components are organized into active complexes, review the data linking components of the three cell polarity modules to the Hippo pathway, and discuss a feedback loop whereby the Hippo pathway regulates apical domain size.

2.1. Hippo pathway components assemble at the apical membrane

The concept of Hippo signaling has shifted from a model of a simple kinase cascade to a “super-complex” with multiple protein–protein interactions that may occur between pathway components to regulate YAP/TAZ and Yki activity in a network-like fashion. In *Drosophila*, four apically localized transmembrane proteins regulate the Hippo pathway: the atypical cadherins Fat and Dachsous, the apical polarity determinant Crb, and the cell adhesion molecule Echinoid (Ed) [38–43] (Fig. 1). In addition to these transmembrane proteins, other proteins that signal to the core of the Hippo pathway are also localized to the apical membrane. The WW-domain containing protein Kibra (Kib) and the FERM-domain containing adaptor proteins Merlin and Expanded (Ex) localize to the apical membrane [44–47], as does the atypical myosin Dachs, which transduces signals from Fat to Wts [48]. Apical localization of the Hpo kinase and the Rassf and Mats components has also been reported [49,50]. Kib, Mer, Ex, Hpo, and Sav are present in a complex [11,13–15,44–46,51], and Ed complexes with Kib, Ex, Mer, Sav, and Yki [38]. Yki can directly bind to Ex, Hpo, and Wts, which results in the sequestration of Yki in the cytoplasm, a mechanism of Yki regulation that does not rely upon phosphorylation by Wts [52,53]. In mammals, the Hippo pathway also contains apically localized

components: MST1/2, CRB3, MER, KIBRA, and Angiomotin family members (AMOT, AMOTL1, AMOTL2) localize to the apical membrane and some directly interact with apical polarity components [54–57]. In cell culture, an apically localized fraction of MST1 displays high enzymatic activity and targeting MST1 to the plasma membrane increases the phosphorylation of targets [50,58–60].

Thus, the apical domain has properties that increase the activity of Hippo signaling and it may serve as a “docking site” where apical proteins serve as a scaffold for the assembly of Hippo pathway components. Hippo signaling may thus act through a network of interactions between multiple components, including proteins involved in regulating cell polarity.

2.2. The Crumbs complex regulates Hippo signaling

Crb is a transmembrane protein that regulates Hippo signaling in addition to its function in apical-basal cell polarity [49,54,61–63]. Curiously, Crb homologs regulate Hippo signaling and polarity in both flies and vertebrates but apparently through different mechanisms.

In mammalian cells, YAP/TAZ and CRB3 exist in a complex and CRB3 is required to prevent their nuclear localization [54]. This activity is regulated by cell density: at high density, the Crumbs complex component PALS1 concentrates at the cell membrane and YAP/TAZ localize predominantly in the cytoplasm, while at low density PALS1 is localized more diffusely and there is a greater amount of YAP/TAZ in the nucleus [54]. Knockdown of CRB3 or PALS1 in high-density cultures decreases YAP phosphorylation and increases levels of nuclear YAP and TAZ [54]. Therefore, CRB3 is required to keep YAP/TAZ out of the nucleus. However, at high cell density, YAP and TAZ are distributed throughout the cytoplasm and do not strictly co-localize with the Crumbs complex [54]. CRB3 may sequester a small, stable fraction of cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ or perhaps all YAP/TAZ molecules have transient interactions with the Crumbs complex as part of their regulation. How CRB3 affects the localization of YAP/TAZ is unclear but likely involves AMOT proteins (AMOT, AMOTL1, AMOTL2) [54,64–66]. AMOT proteins bind to YAP/TAZ, and also to PALS1 and PATJ, to retain YAP/TAZ in the cytoplasm [57,64–67]. AMOT can also regulate YAP indirectly by binding to LATS2 and increasing its kinase activity, indicating that AMOT proteins may regulate Hippo signaling by multiple mechanisms [65–67]. Therefore, the polarity complex-associating AMOT proteins provide a link between cell polarity and the growth-regulating Hippo pathway.

In Drosophila, Crb also regulates the activity of the Hippo pathway and crb mutant imaginal discs overgrow [61–63]. Drosophila lack AMOT but Drosophila Crb signals through another Hippo pathway component, Ex, which is poorly conserved in vertebrates [61–64,66]. Crb binds Ex, stabilizing its localization at the apical membrane to promote Hippo signaling [62] and crb mutant imaginal disc cells lose Ex from the apical membrane [61,63]. Interestingly, in Drosophila the effects of Crb on cell polarity and the Hippo pathway are separable. The intracellular domain of Crb contains two conserved motifs: a C-terminal PDZ-binding motif that directly binds to Stardust and mediates the effects of Crb on cell polarity, and a FERM domain binding motif that binds to Ex and mediates the effect on Hippo signaling [61–63,68]. Mammalian CRB3 interacts with AMOT indirectly via the other polarity proteins in the complex [54], but it remains to be seen whether the FERM domain binding motifs of mammalian CRB proteins plays a role in regulating Hippo signaling.

Several data indicate that Crb transduces information from outside the cell membrane to the Hippo pathway. First, in Drosophila imaginal discs, crb mutant cells cause mislocalization of Ex protein in neighboring, Crb-expressing cells [63]. Second, the cell density dependent effect on PALS1 and YAP/TAZ localization in mammalian cells suggests that CRB proteins may mediate contact inhibition of cell proliferation [54]. Contact inhibition describes the proliferation arrest that is observed in densely cultured cells, a phenomenon in which Hippo signaling is implicated [20,69,70]. Thus, the Crumbs complex may play a role in integrating social cues into the Hippo pathway.

2.3. The aPKC cell polarity complex and Hippo signaling

The aPKC serine-threonine kinases regulate polarity through interactions with Par3 and Par6 proteins and also regulate the Hippo pathway [35,49,71,72]. Overexpression of an active form of aPKC in Drosophila imaginal discs leads to increased cell proliferation [49,71,72]. Expression of aPKC later in development causes defects in photoreceptor subtype differentiation in the retina, a process that also is regulated by the Hippo pathway [73]. Imaginal disc cells overexpressing active aPKC show mis-localization of Hippo and Rassf and increased nuclear localization of Yki [49,78]. Thus, ectopic expression of active aPKC disturbs Hippo signaling, causing mis-localization of pathway components [49,78]. Whether the effect of aPKC requires Crb is unknown, but in mammals aPKC directly interacts with and phosphorylates KIBRA to recruit it to the membrane through a domain that is conserved in Drosophila [74,75]. aPKC may thus directly regulate the Hippo pathway independently of the Crumbs complex.

2.4. The Scribble module regulates Hippo signaling

The basolateral domain of polarized cells is defined by the presence of Scrib, Lgl, and Dlg [36]. In Drosophila, mutations in these genes result in giant larvae possessing imaginal discs that hyper-proliferate and form multi-layered balls of poorly differentiated cells [36]. Because of the overgrowth and disruption of epithelial architecture that occurs when they are disrupted, they have been termed neoplastic tumor suppressor genes. Notably, Hippo signaling is disrupted in scrib and lgl mutants, which fuels their abnormal growth [49,76–78]. Thus, imaginal discs mutant for scrib express high levels of Yki reporters and require Yki for overgrowth [49,76,77].

Mammalian SCRIB also interacts with the Hippo pathway and this interaction may be highly relevant to cancer. TAZ is required for the self-renewal and tumorigenic potential of breast cancer stem cells and loss of SCRIB promotes TAZ activity, while expression of a membrane-tethered SCRIB strongly inhibits TAZ [79]. SCRIB is required in breast cancer cell lines for the recruitment of MST2 to the TAZ/LATS1/2 complex [79]. Thus SCRIB mislocalization or loss of function results in hyperactivation of TAZ, promoting a cancer stem cell phenotype [79]. In Drosophila imaginal discs, Hpo and Rassf are mislocalized in lgl clones, suggesting that in cells with disrupted polarity the apical complex regulating Hippo signaling may be missing critical components [49]. These data indicate that the Scribble module acts as a tumor suppressor at least in part by inhibiting Yki/YAP/TAZ.

2.5. Regulation of apical domain size by feedback from the Hippo pathway

The apical domain is not only an important site for Hippo signaling but is also regulated by the Hippo pathway. Cells lacking hpo, wts, or mer and ex have enlarged apical domains that show elevated levels of apically localized membrane receptors, such as Fat, Notch, and the Drosophila Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor [7,8,15,47,80,81]. The apical domain proteins aPKC, Crb, and Patj are enriched in cells mutant for Hippo pathway components or when Yki is overexpressed [80,81]. This receptor enrichment phenotype is Yki dependent, and thus a downstream effect of the Hippo pathway [80,81]. Removing crb from wts clones suppresses the enrichment of apical proteins and the apical hypertrophy, indicating that the Hippo pathway requires the apical complex to generate these phenotypes [80]. However, loss of crb in wts cells has no effect on their hyper-proliferation, demonstrating that apical hypertrophy and accumulation of membrane receptors is not the cause of the hyper-proliferation seen in Hippo pathway mutants [80,81]. Thus, the Hippo pathway regulates apical membrane size in parallel to the regulation of cellular proliferation in Drosophila imaginal discs [80,81]. Similarly, in mammalian cells, knock-down of KIBRA or activation of YAP results in apical domain expansion [75]. Thus, the apical domain is a target as well as a regulator of the Hippo pathway in both flies and vertebrates.

2.6. Hippo signaling, loss of polarity, and cancer

Loss of polarity is thought to be a key step in the transformation of normal epithelial cells into cancer cells [82]. Loss or mis-localization of many apical-basal polarity complex components has been found in primary tumors and in cancer cell lines [83]. In addition, YAP/TAZ activity is high in many cancers [64]. However, mutation of known Hippo pathway components in cancers is rare [6]. Thus, other defects may be the cause of hyperactive YAP/TAZ. If the Hippo pathway complex does indeed form a large complex at the apical membrane, disruption of this localization may be sufficient to disturb signaling. Therefore, disruption of polarity regulators may explain high levels of YAP/TAZ activity in cancers in the absence of mutations or silencing of core pathway components.

AJ [20,85,87]. In vivo, deleting α-catenin from hair follicles in mice leads to formation of squamous cell skin tumors [87]. This effect requires YAP [87] and artificial activation of YAP phenocopies loss of α-catenin, resulting in expansion of the epidermal stem cell compartment, thickening of the skin, and formation of squamous cell carcinoma-like tumors [85,86]. Notably, decreased α-catenin levels are associated with human skin tumors [86]. However, whether all effects of α-catenin loss depend on interaction with 14-3-3 and YAP, or whether there are other effects that may be mediated by α-catenin’s cytoskeletal regulatory role remains to be tested.

3. Adherens junctions as signaling centers for the Hippo pathway

Adherens junctions (AJs) are sites where neighboring cells attach to one another and mediate cell contact interactions and social cues to the Hippo pathway [20,35,38,54,84–89]. AJs contain large transmembrane nectin and cadherin proteins that form trans-homodimers [35,83]. The cytoplasmic portions of these proteins interact with catenins (β-catenin, α-catenin, and p120 catenin) that bind to the cytoskeleton and interact with signaling pathways [90]. Thus, the AJs serve as a hub of cytoskeletal organization and are implicated in mechanosensing [90]. Recent studies identified AJ proteins as direct regulators of the Hippo pathway.

3.1. Adherens junctions convey social cues into the Hippo pathway

Cadherins mediate cell adhesion and play important roles in development and homeostasis [90]. Epithelial cells express E-cadherin, which engages in homophilic interactions to join neighboring cells together, forming AJs [90]. Cultured mammalian cells require E-cadherin and β-catenin in order to limit their proliferation by contact inhibition [54,84,85]. Contact inhibition no longer occurs when KIBRA, MERLIN, or LATS1/2 are knocked down, suggesting that Hippo signaling plays a role in mediating contact inhibition [20,27,84,87]. YAP localizes to the cytoplasm of contact-inhibited cells but translocates to the nucleus when β-catenin is knocked down, indicating that junctions inhibit YAP’s entry into the nucleus [84]. Thus, contact inhibition, which may be a signal that is partially mediated through cell–cell junctions, is mediated by the Hippo pathway. Drosophila AJs also contain another transmembrane protein, Ed, which mediates cell–cell adhesion and is thought to function as an analog of mammalian nectins [91,92]. Ed binds to Sav and promotes its stability and localization [38]. Imaginal discs with reduced levels of Ed overgrow and show elevation of Yki reporter activity [38]. The cytoplasmic domain of Ed also interacts with the polarity component Bazooka and the F-actin interacting protein Canoe (Afadin), providing direct and indirect mechanisms by which it can affect the Hippo pathway [92]. Thus, transmembrane proteins that comprise AJs appear to act as sensors for social cues that regulate proliferation through the Hippo pathway.

3.2. α-catenin and the Hippo pathway

The intracellular domain of E-cadherin interacts with α-catenin, which serves as a link to the actin cytoskeleton [90]. Loss of α-catenin in keratinocytes results in nuclear translocation and thus hyper-activation of YAP and a loss of contact inhibition [87]. Interestingly, α-catenin binds to 14-3-3, which interacts with YAP and may thus regulate YAP activity by sequestering a pool of YAP to the

3.3. LIM-domain proteins Zyxin and Ajuba

Two LIM-domain containing proteins, Zyxin and Ajuba (dJub in flies), which localize to the AJs, have recently been identified as negative regulators of Hippo signaling [88,89]. In the growing Drosophila wing Zyxin and dJub are required for normal growth by antagonizing the activity of Wts [88,89]. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that dJub associates with Wts in Drosophila S2 cells and in mammalian cell lines, Ajuba associates with LATS1/2 [89]. The C-terminal LIM domain of Zyxin associates with Wts in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, but this interaction does not occur with full-length Zyxin [88]. In mammalian cells Zyxin accumulates at focal adhesions in response to the formation of stress fibers and tension, while it is found at the AJ in Drosophila [93–95]. Thus, Zyxin may serve a mechanosensor that regulates the Hippo pathway.

The involvement of AJ proteins in Hippo signaling suggests that they may provide a path for social cues to impinge on the pathway. Because AJs are anchors for the cytoskeleton and because they mediate mechanical tension between cells, they may also transduce mechanical cues into the Hippo pathway.

4. Regulation of Hippo signaling by the cytoskeleton and mechanical forces

One of the most exciting aspects of Hippo signaling is the finding that manipulating the physical properties of cells can alter the activity of the Hippo pathway. The main experimental strategies to study the effects of mechanical forces on Hippo signaling have been altering the stiffness of a cell’s environment, the extracellular matrix (ECM), manipulating the amount of cell spreading through micropatterned cell culture substrates, and by detaching cells from the matrix [33,34,96]. The results of such manipulation indicate that the activity of YAP/TAZ and Yki is regulated by mechanical forces and that the cytoskeleton plays an important role in the transduction of mechanical stimuli to the Hippo pathway [33,34,96].

4.1. Matrix stiffness as a regulator of YAP and TAZ activity

Cells are embedded in the ECM, a protein network whose mechanical properties can have dramatic effects on the behavior of cells. For example, cells have higher rates of proliferation on stiff matrix than on soft [97]. Strikingly, substrate stiffness also affects cell fate decisions: mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) differentiate into osteoblasts on a stiff matrix but adopt other identities, such as adipocytes, in soft environments [98,99]. These effects are mediated through YAP/TAZ [34]. On stiff substrates, YAP/TAZ are predominantly nuclear, while cells on soft substrates have more cytoplasmic YAP/TAZ [34]. This regulation of YAP/TAZ is important to mediate the cellular responses to substrate stiffness because depletion of YAP/TAZ inhibited osteogenic differentiation on stiff substrates [34]. Thus, mechanical signals regulate YAP/TAZ, which are required for cell differentiation triggered by changes in mechanical signals. Inhibition of Rho or disruption of the actin cytoskeleton
inhibited YAP/TAZ activity on stiff substrates, demonstrating that they are required for YAP/TAZ to act as mediators of mechanical signals [34]. The response of YAP/TAZ to matrix rigidity appears to have some independence from the MST1/2 and LATS1/2 signaling axis since a non-phosphorylatable version of YAP, where the sites of phosphorylation by LATS1/2 are mutated, is still regulated by substrate stiffness [34].

### 4.2. Alterations in cell geometry regulate Hippo signaling

The activity of the Hippo pathway is not only affected by the substrate stiffness but also by the shape of cells [33,34]. Experiments that use micropatterned substrates with either large islands that cause individual cells to adopt a flat, spread morphology or small islands that induce a round, compact shape show that spread-out cells have higher levels of nuclear YAP than round cells [33,34]. Importantly, cells grown on micropillars such that cells are able to spread out as they do on the large islands but have an area of direct contact with the substrate similar to cells grown on the small islands have enrichment of nuclear YAP similar to cells grown on the large islands [34]. Therefore, the localization of YAP/TAZ does not depend on the amount of matrix contact but truly on cell geometry [34]. Thus, YAP/TAZ are regulated by the shape of cells.

### 4.3. Cell attachment as a regulator of Hippo signaling

Whether or not cells are attached to a matrix or to each other also provides a mechanism for the regulation of cell behavior. When cells detach, they initiate an apoptotic process called anoikis. Guan and colleagues tested whether YAP was regulated during anoikis in cell culture [96]. In cells that are detached from the matrix and neighbors, LATS kinases phosphorylate and inhibit YAP activity while increased YAP levels in detached cells prevents anoikis [96]. Interestingly, decreased Hippo signaling prevents anoikis in several prostate cell lines and resistance to anoikis may contribute to the survival and metastasis of cancer cells [96]. Thus inactivation of Hippo signaling may allow tumor cells to evade anoikis, thereby contributing to cancer development.

### 4.4. The actin cytoskeleton regulates Hippo signaling

The observation that mechanical changes in the environment of a cell can affect Hippo signaling raises the question of how mechanical stimuli are sensed and transduced to the Hippo pathway. Several studies have now linked changes in cytoskeletal activity to regulation of the Hippo pathway, suggesting that the cytoskeleton is a key mediator of mechanical signals into the Hippo pathway.

The assembly and disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton is regulated by a number of actin regulating and binding proteins, some of which have been linked to regulation of Hippo signaling [33,100,101]. These are the actin capping proteins Cpa and Cpb, which form a heterodimer that functions to prevent F-actin polymerization, and Diaphanous (Dia), which stimulates F-acting polymerization [102–104], as well as Rho and Rho-kinase (ROCK) [33,34,96,100,101]. In *Drosophila* wing imaginal discs, knockdown of Cpa/Cpb or expression of activated Dia results in increased levels of F-actin and also causes increased cell proliferation and tissue overgrowth [100,101]. Such tissues show hyper-activation of Yki, which is required for the tissue overgrowth [100,101]. Interestingly, F-actin status also regulates Hippo signaling in a *Drosophila* model of neurodegeneration using the adult retina [105]. Overgrowth initiated by activation of Dia is suppressed by knockdown of Yki or overexpression of Wts, but not overexpression of Hpo or Ex, suggesting that F-actin works upstream of Wts but downstream of Hpo [100]. Experiments in cultured mammalian cells showed that, similar to insects, activation of Dia in cells increases levels

of nuclear YAP and YAP activity, and disruption of actin filaments inhibits YAP activity [33,34,96,100]. Thus, the amount of F-actin has a strong effect on the Hippo pathway. Activation of the small GTP-ase RHO promotes the formation of stress fibers and inhibition of RHO leads to a loss of active YAP/TAZ [33,34]. Thus, manipulation of cytoskeletal conformation affects the activity of the Hippo pathway effector proteins Yki/YAP/TAZ.

Cytoskeletal remodeling occurs in response to changes in cell density and shape. For example, F-actin stress fibers are abundant in cells at low cell density but rare in high-density cultures and flat cells have more stress fibers than round cells [33,34]. There is a positive correlation between the presence of stress fibers in a cell and the nuclear localization of YAP/TAZ and disruption of stress fibers causes YAP/TAZ to shift to the cytoplasm [33,34,96,100]. In addition to actin, the microtubule cytoskeleton may regulate YAP/TAZ activity. For instance, the microtubule cytoskeleton is required for detachment-induced YAP phosphorylation [96]. These data suggest that the actin cytoskeleton plays a key role in transducing mechanical signals into the Hippo pathway.

Interestingly, the cytoskeleton and mechanical stimuli may be acting on YAP/TAZ through both LATS dependent and independent mechanisms. LATS1/2 are required for YAP to shift to the cytoplasm in cells were stress fibers are disrupted, suggesting a LATS1/2-dependent mechanism [33]. In contrast to that, knock-down of LATS has little effect on the regulation of YAP/TAZ by cell shape and expressing a LATS1/2-insensitive form of mutant TAZ is still responsive to mechanical cues [34]. Thus, although it is clear that mechanical signals and the cytoskeleton are regulators of YAP/TAZ, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not yet understood and may involve multiple mechanisms.

### 5. The Hippo pathway mediates changes in cell behavior in response to mechanical signals

The data discussed above show an important role for cell architecture and mechanical forces in regulating the Hippo pathway. This regulation may play key roles in normal developmental processes as well as in diseases such as cancer.

#### 5.1. Mechanical regulation of the Hippo pathway during development

Mechanical signals may play important roles in guiding multipotent cells toward their fates [99]. An intriguing case where YAP activity is regulated by social cues to define a cell lineage decision occurs early in mouse development [106]. The first lineage specification event in mouse embryonic development occurs in the blastocyst when the inner cell mass (ICM), which will form the embryo and associated tissues, is distinguished from the trophectoderm (TE), which will form extra-embryonic tissues [1]. The presumptive TE cells are found on the exterior of the developing blastocyst, while the presumptive ICM cells are interior. This positional difference may lead to differences in the mechanical and social cues affecting two populations of cells. The TEAD4 transcription factor, which interacts with YAP and TAZ to mediate output of the Hippo pathway [20] has been shown to play an instructive role in determining whether blastocyst cells will adopt TE or ICM fate [106]. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, TEAD4 expression is sufficient to promote TE fate, while ICM cells have low levels of YAP and TEAD4 activity [106]. The exclusion of YAP from the nuclei of the interior, presumptive ICM cells, may be the result of contact inhibition or cytoskeletal signals transducing information about the position of the cell within the embryo to YAP regulation [106]. Thus, Hippo signaling may play a key role in translating information regarding the position of cells within an organism to the refinement of cell fate.

5.2. Mechanical forces and the Hippo pathway in organ size control

Developing tissues grow by cell proliferation but in most organisms, including flies and mammals, the determination of final organ size is not simply achieved by counting the number of cell divisions [107,108]. Rather, cell division patterns are not pre-determined and cells adjust their proliferation rate to the changing requirements of a tissue, a phenomenon referred to as regulatory development [1]. Thus, a system may exist to sense tissue status, providing feedback to cells regarding whether or not further proliferation is required and the Hippo pathway is a candidate to mediate this signal. The mechanisms of this scaling process have been the subject of much speculation and several models have been proposed, including the polar coordinate model, morphogen gradient models, and mechanical force models [107–110]. These models are not necessarily mutually exclusive and there is evidence that the Hippo pathway is regulated by morphogen gradients [39]. The models based on mechanical forces postulate that morphogen-driven proliferation is counteracted by mechanical compression that increases with the size of the tissue [111,112]. Because Hippo signaling responds to mechanical cues and is key to organ size regulation, it may mediate mechanical signals into growth control. While the mechanisms by which this occurs are not known, we expect it to be a very active area of research in the future.

5.3. Mechanical regulation of the Hippo pathway during cancer development

The finding that YAP/TAZ activity can be regulated by the stiffness of a cell’s environment not only provides a fascinating glimpse into how mechanical forces are translated into gene expression, but has important implications for cancer biology. Tumors are harder than normal tissues and tumor cells have altered integrin expression, elevated RHO-dependent cytoskeletal tension, and are surrounded by stiff stroma [113]. Furthermore, the growth-promoting activity of RHO and ERK is enhanced by rigid environments [113]. If the relationship between matrix rigidity and YAP/TAZ activity observed in mammalian cell culture holds true in intact tissues, the stiffening of tumor cells likely contributes to the increased activity of YAP/TAZ observed in cancer cells.

5.4. Conclusions

There is now myriad evidence that the activity of the Hippo signaling pathway is closely intertwined with signals that convey position, orientation, and social cues to cells. Such studies are generating excitement because of the promise of testing long-proposed hypotheses about how spatial information may be encoded in tissues and transmitted to cells. Importantly, changes in polarity and stiffness of the cell stroma may be influencing which cells become cancerous and how they behave. We believe that understanding how these changes affect Hippo signaling offers the possibility of better understanding development and disease.

An important challenge currently facing the field is elucidating the mechanisms by which cell polarity cues and mechanical signals regulate the Hippo pathway. Since cells rely upon coordinated function of the proteins regulating apical-basal polarity, cell junctions, and the cytoskeleton, disruption of any one of these processes may affect the others. For instance, a loss of AJ integrity may result in a mis-localization of Hippo pathway components that bind to AJs, affecting their signaling ability, but it also affects the organization of the cytoskeleton, which may independently regulate YAP/TAZ. Determining how the multiple links between cell architecture and mechanical cues interact with Hippo signaling and one another will require clever experimental designs,

perhaps including the development of experimental systems by which mechanical signals can be precisely applied to cells, and the resulting effects measured. Applying these techniques to the study of the Hippo pathway, which appears to be unique in the extent to which its activity is regulated by cell polarity and the cytoskeleton, may provide important advancement in our understanding of how the proliferation and survival of cells is regulated by tissue status, social cues, and positional information.
