MET, METASTASIS, MOTILITY AND MORE

**Carmen Birchmeier**, **Walter Birchmeier**, **Ermanno Gherardi** and **George F. Vande Woude**

Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor and its receptor, the tyrosine kinase Met, arose late in evolution and are unique to vertebrates. In spite of this, Met uses molecules such as Gab1 — homologues of which are present in *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster* — for downstream signalling. Pivotal roles for Met in development and cancer have been established: Met controls cell migration and growth in embryogenesis; it also controls growth, invasion and metastasis in cancer cells; and activating Met mutations predispose to human cancer.

**MET** was first identified in the 1980s as an oncogene<sup>1</sup>. This first isolate corresponded to a mutant form that contained the MET tyrosine kinase fused to a dimerization domain (TPR–MET; translocated promoter region fused to MET). The proto-oncogene was found to encode a receptor tyrosine kinase, but its ligand was unknown at the time<sup>2</sup>. Independently, two different experimental approaches characterized a potent motility factor (scatter factor, SF<sup>3</sup>) and a factor that was mitogenic for hepatocytes (hepatocyte growth factor, HGF<sup>4-6</sup>). These factors turned out to be the same molecule<sup>7,8</sup>, which is referred to here as HGF/SF. Subsequent experiments established HGF/SF as the Met ligand<sup>9</sup>.

Early sequence analysis of HGF/SF showed the presence of a domain structure that had not been found before in other growth factors and that was typical of the proteinases of the plasminogen family<sup>4,5,10</sup>. Recent developments have shown that the Met receptor also has a distinctive domain structure with a β-propeller fold that is responsible for ligand binding<sup>11</sup>. Two aspects of Met signalling are characteristic: first, the Met carboxy-terminal tail contains a unique docking site that is responsible for the recruitment of downstream signalling molecules<sup>12</sup>, and second, a single adaptor, known as Gab1 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder 1), mediates most of the complex cellular responses to Met activation<sup>13,14</sup>. These responses include profound effects on epithelial-cell motility, growth and formation of branched tubules<sup>3-6,15</sup>. Genetic analysis of HGF/SF and

Met in mice has shown essential roles in development, namely in the control of growth and survival of epithelial cells and migration of myogenic precursor cells<sup>16-18</sup>. Furthermore, since their discovery, the function of these molecules in cancer has been studied extensively, and a

IMMUNOGLOBULIN DOMAIN  
A protein domain of ~90 amino acids consisting of two β-sheets. There are at least 5 distinct structural sets of the domain (V, C1, C2, I and E) that differ in the number, length and position of the strands that compose the two β-sheets.

KRINGLE DOMAIN  
A protein domain of ~80 amino acids characterized by limited secondary-structure elements and defined by three conserved disulphide bonds.

SERINE PROTEINASES  
Endopeptidases that contain serine, histidine and aspartate in the catalytic site and include the complex, multidomain enzymes of the complement, blood-clotting and fibrinolytic systems. They are synthesized as inactive, single-chain zymogens and converted into active enzymes by site-specific proteolysis.

HEPARAN-SULPHATE PROTEOGLYCAN  
A protein that is bound to a complex polysaccharide (heparan-sulphate glycosaminoglycan) that is present at the cell surface or in the extracellular matrix. When bound to ligand, it can have a key signalling role.

TYROSINE KINASE DOMAIN  
A protein domain with the ability to catalyse the transfer of the γ-phosphate group of ATP to tyrosine residues on protein substrates. Several growth-factor receptors have tyrosine kinase activity, which triggers a cascade of protein–protein interactions as a result of ligand-induced kinase activation.

SEMA DOMAIN  
A protein domain of ~450 amino acids identified in the semaphorin axon guidance proteins. Plexins (cell adhesion and semaphorin receptors) and the Met and Ron receptors also contain the sema domain or a variant of it. The sema domain of the Met receptor and of semaphorins adopts a β-propeller fold.

amino-terminal domain (N), four KRINGLE DOMAINS (K1–K4) and a serine proteinase homology (SPH) domain, which lacks enzymatic activity as a result of mutations in essential residues²⁰. Like plasminogen, HGF/SF is synthesized as a single-chain, largely inactive, precursor (pro-HGF/SF) and is converted proteolytically into a two-chain, active heterodimer. Cleavage of pro-HGF/SF occurs at a trypsin-like site that is located after K4, and this produces a disulphide-linked α- and β-chain heterodimer (FIG. 1). Conversion of pro-HGF/SF is effected by several serine proteinases, including the plasminogen activators uPA (urokinase plasminogen activator) and tPA (tissue-type plasminogen activator); coagulation factors X, XI and XII; and a close homologue of factor XII (see REF. 21 and references therein). So, although the biological activity of HGF/SF depends solely on receptor binding, the factor has retained, throughout evolution, the architecture and mechanism of activation of the complex SERINE PROTEINASES typical of vertebrates. HGF/SF also binds HEPARAN-SULPHATE PROTEOGLYCANS with high affinity, which limits the diffusion of the factor *in vivo*. Unlike the case of fibroblast growth factor (FGF), however, the interaction of HGF/SF and heparan sulphate is not essential for receptor activation²¹⁻²³.

A fragment containing the amino-terminal and K1 domains (known as NK1) has provided a partial structure of HGF/SF (FIG. 1). NK1 contains the main receptor-binding site, and its structure has provided clear insights into the mechanism of ligand–receptor interaction. Independent crystal forms of NK1 and NK1-heparin complexes yielded a tightly-packed, head-to-tail dimer with extensive interactions between two NK1 molecules²⁴⁻²⁶. The recurrence of this dimer in different crystallographic environments implies that it might correspond to the biologically active form of NK1. Two patches of residues constitute the primary receptor-binding site of NK1 and are located on opposing faces of the dimer²²,²⁵,²⁷. The structure therefore indicates that the NK1 dimer engages two Met molecules, which leads to receptor dimerization. Mutagenesis studies also indicate that residues in the SPH domain of HGF/SF might make additional contacts with Met²⁰.

Met. Like its ligand, the Met receptor (FIG. 2) is a disulphide-linked heterodimer, which results from cleavage of a precursor at a furin site that is located between residues 307 and 308. So the mature form of Met consists of an extracellular α chain and a longer β chain. The β chain encompasses the remainder of the Met ectodomain, the transmembrane helix and the cytoplasmic portion. The latter contains the juxtamembrane and KINASE DOMAINS as well as a carboxy-terminal tail that is essential for downstream signalling.

New insights into the domain structure of Met were recently obtained by mutagenesis experiments. These studies have shown that the α chain and the first 212 residues of the β chain are sufficient for HGF/SF binding¹¹ (FIG. 2). This region of Met is homologous to the so-called 'SEMA' DOMAIN of the semaphorin axon-guidance

causative role for Met activating mutations in tumorigenesis is now established¹⁹.

Here, we review key concepts and recent progress in four areas: structure–function analysis of HGF/SF and of Met; Met-receptor signalling; and the roles of HGF/SF and Met in development and cancer. Emphasis will be given, where possible, to progress that has been made using genetic analysis. Finally, therapeutic applications of MET inhibitors in human cancer will be discussed.

Structural features of HGF/SF and Met  
HGF/SF is a large, multidomain protein that is similar to plasminogen, a circulating proenzyme, the active form of which is responsible for the lysis of blood clots. HGF/SF consists of six domains (FIG. 1): an

Scaffolding adaptors such as mammalian Gab1 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder 1) and its *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Caenorhabditis elegans* homologues daughter-of-sevenless (Dos) and suppressor-of-clear 1 (Soc1), the downstream-of-kinase proteins (DOKs), insulin-receptor substrate (IRS) and fibroblast-growth-factor-receptor substrate (FRS) lack enzymatic activities, but are recruited to activated receptor tyrosine kinases and cytokine receptors. They become phosphorylated on tyrosine residues, and provide binding sites for multiple signal-relay molecules such as adaptor proteins and enzymes. Scaffolding adaptors share a common structure (see figure), which includes a membrane-targeting sequence such as a pleckstrin-homology (PH) domain that binds to specific lipids at the plasma membrane, or a myristoylation site (M). Their central proline-rich domains (P) contain numerous binding sites for Src-homology-3 (SH3) DOMAINS. In addition, Gab1 contains a unique Met-binding site (MBS) that allows its direct interaction with Met but not with other receptors. Several tyrosine phosphorylation sites (Y) are scattered along the sequence of the scaffolding adaptors, and these enable them to recruit molecules with Src-homology-2 (SH2) or phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains. Genetic evidence in mice, *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* demonstrates the importance of these proteins for signalling by receptor tyrosine kinases. The mammalian Gab proteins function downstream of many receptors — for example, those for HGF/SF, epidermal growth factor, insulin, nerve growth factor, interleukin-3 and interleukin-6, interferon, and erythropoietin — as well as in signalling of the B- and T-cell receptors (reviewed in REF.37).

from crystal structures, it provides the basis for testable hypotheses on structure and function. The structural features of HGF/SF and Met are shared by a second ligand–receptor pair that is known as HGF-like/MSP (macrophage stimulating protein) and Ron (see REF. 29 for a review). The discussion of the latter molecules, however, is outside the scope of this review.

Met signal transduction

The signalling molecules downstream of Met — for instance Gab1 — have homologues in *Drosophila melanogaster* and *Caenorhabditis elegans* that mediate signal transduction downstream of other receptor tyrosine kinases<sup>30,31</sup> (BOX 1). How were these old signalling modules connected to a receptor such as Met, which has evolved relatively recently? Crucial to this adaptation was the creation of the unique bidentate docking site of Met, which comprises tyrosine residues Y1349 and Y1356 and surrounding amino-acid residues<sup>12</sup>. When phosphorylated, this docking site binds substrates such as Gab1, Grb2, phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) and others<sup>12,13,32</sup> (FIG. 3). Most of these contain Src-homology-2 (SH2)-DOMAIN binding sites, which in many, but not all, cases mediate the interaction (see below). For steric reasons, two substrates cannot simultaneously bind to the bidentate site of one Met molecule<sup>33</sup>. However, Gab1 can bind to phosphorylated (p)Y1349 on one Met molecule, and Grb2 can bind to pY1356 on a second, and so an interaction between Gab1 and Grb2 might occur on Met dimers or multimers. When the bidentate site is transferred to other receptor tyrosine kinases, cellular responses that are typical for Met are observed<sup>34</sup>.

Gab1, a versatile adaptor protein. Genetic and cell biological evidence have shown that Gab1 is the most crucial substrate for Met signalling<sup>14,35</sup>. Gab1 is a scaffolding adaptor that is recruited directly and indirectly to activated tyrosine kinases (BOX 1). Direct interaction with tyrosine-phosphorylated Met is mediated by a sequence of 13 amino acids — the Met-binding site — in Gab1. This sequence does not resemble the classical SH2- and phosphotyrosine-binding (PTB) domains and is not present in other members of the Gab family<sup>32,36</sup>. The generation of this Met-binding site on Gab1 is therefore another crucial step in evolution. It allows a direct and robust interaction between Gab1 and Met and results in prolonged Gab1 phosphorylation in response to HGF/SF. Such prolonged Gab1 phosphorylation cannot be evoked by epidermal growth factor (EGF)<sup>35</sup>. So Met and Gab1 provide an example of a powerful new signalling system that has been created from old and new building blocks.

Phosphorylated Gab1 binds signal-relay molecules, such as the SH2-domain-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (Shp2), PI3K, phospholipase C, and Crk (reviewed in REFS 37,38), through their SH2 domains. Genetic studies in *Drosophila* and *C. elegans* indicate that the Shp2 orthologues are key molecules in the transmission of receptor tyrosine kinase signals<sup>30,31</sup> in which they act downstream of receptor tyrosine kinases

proteins, and might fold into a β-propeller structure (FIG. 2). A similar propeller fold is present at the amino terminus of the integrin α-chain and is responsible for protein–protein interactions<sup>28</sup>. The remainder of the Met ectodomain contains a small cysteine-rich sequence, which is followed by four repeats of an unusual type of immunoglobulin domain (FIG. 2). The latter might form a 'stalk' structure that holds the propeller domain in the correct orientation for ligand binding. So, the outline domain structure of Met is now understood and, although this awaits confirmation

E3 UBIQUITIN LIGASE, binds phosphorylated Y1003, and this results in Met ubiquitylation, endocytosis, transport to the endosomal compartment and, finally, degradation40-42. Cbl can also be recruited to Met through Grb2. Cbl-mediated degradation of the activated receptor therefore provides a mechanism that attenuates or terminates Met signalling. The increased stability of Tpr-Met and the Met mutant Y1003F might contribute to the transforming capacity of these molecules.

### Cellular responses to Met signalling

In response to Met signals, characteristic cellular responses are evoked. These can depend on the cell type and the culture conditions used. HGF/SF and Met signals induce proliferative and anti-apoptotic responses in various cell types. Epithelial cells, and particularly the Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cell line, respond to HGF/SF and Met signals by ‘scattering’ — that is, they undergo colony dispersal, EPITHELIAL-MESENCHYMAL TRANSITION (EMT) and they increase their motility (FIG. 5; see also REF. 43 for a review). Such dissociated cells invade collagen matrices44, an assay that is used to estimate the invasive and metastatic capacity of cells (FIG. 5). Moreover, when they are cultured within a collagen matrix, MDCK cells that are treated with HGF/SF form branched tubules15. Tubular branching is a complex morphogenic process that is observed in culture, and requires tight coordination of cell growth, polarity and movement (BOX 2).

Many researchers have attempted to define the role of individual downstream effectors of Met signalling in specific cellular responses. Initial experiments showed that inhibitors of PI3K or ERK/MAPK prevent scattering of epithelial cells, which indicates that both the ERK/MAPK and the PI3K pathways are important for the disassembly of adherens junctions, cell spreading and motility45. The Gab1–Shp2–ERK/MAPK cascade regulates ETS/AP1 TRANSCRIPTION FACTORS and adhesion molecules, which control cell proliferation, junctional competence and motility13,32,35,36,46-49 (FIG. 6). Met also activates a signalling branch that contains as the key components Ras, Rac1 and p21-activated kinase (PAK) and controls cytoskeletal rearrangement and cell adhesion47,50. Signalling from Gab1 and Crk to another GTPase, Rap1, might also participate in the control of cell motility51,52. This might occur through association of Crk with the Rap1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor C3G. Cell survival is primarily controlled by signalling through PI3K to Akt/protein kinase B (PKB)53,54. In summary, Met signalling is complex and branches into distinct, but interacting, cascades. The formation of tubules, which is the most complex cellular response, requires all known Met signalling branches (FIG. 6; see also REF. 38 for a review). It is interesting to note that Tpr-Met does not induce the formation of branched tubules, implying that balanced and regulated Met activity is essential.

Jun amino-terminal kinase (JNK), signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) 3, nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and β-catenin also participate in Met-Gab1 signalling. Cell transformation by Trp-Met results in

Met signalling in development

Genetic analysis of HGF/SF and Met in mice has shown that this signalling system is essential during development for controlling processes that are specific to vertebrate, or even mammalian, embryogenesis^{16-18}. The functions are not restricted to a single stage or developmental event, nor are the same cellular responses evoked in all instances. The *Met* and *HGF/SF* genes are expressed in dynamic patterns in the embryo, and HGF/SF- and Met-producing cells are frequently located in close proximity, which reflects the limited capacity of HGF/SF to diffuse *in vivo*. The phenotypes of Met and HGF/SF mutants are identical, which shows that, during development, Met is the only functional HGF/SF receptor, and HGF/SF is the only Met ligand. Biochemically defined co-receptors, such as β4-integrin or CD44, do not provide essential co-receptor functions in development, as their ablation in mice does not cause deficits that resemble those of Met or HGF/SF mutants^{67-69}. However, the phenotypes observed in *Met*-/- mice are also present in *Gab1*-/- mice, albeit in a slightly attenuated form^{14}. So the essential role of Gab1 in Met signalling can be shown genetically. It should be noted that Gab1 also participates in the transmission of signals from other receptors, which is reflected by the presence of additional phenotypes in *Gab1*-mutant mice that are absent in *Met*-mutant mice^{70}. By contrast, Grb2 binding of Met is not essential for Met signalling in embryogenesis, indicating that Grb2 has a minor role, if any, in the transmission of Met signals *in vivo*^{71}.

**Met signalling and growth control.** HGF/SF is a potent growth factor for epithelial cells and, during development and in the adult, Met is expressed in the epithelial cells of many organs. In development, HGF/SF and Met provide essential signals for survival and proliferation of hepatocytes and PLACENTAL TROPHOBLASTS. The liver of *HGF/SF*-/- or *Met*-/- embryos is considerably reduced in size, owing to decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis of hepatocytes. The altered placental development in these

In the absence of HGF/SF, MDCK cells adhere, are polarized, and form tight sheets (left). After addition of HGF/SF, MDCK cells dissociate, assume a mesenchymal-cell shape and become motile (right, top). Epithelial cells treated with HGF/SF assume a mesenchymal morphology and might express some, but not the full set of, mesenchymal markers. They return to an epithelial morphology after removal of HGF/SF. When the cells are grown on top of a collagen matrix, they invade the matrix after addition of HGF/SF (right, bottom).

activation of the JNK pathway, which seems to be mediated by Gab1-Crk and/or Gab1-Rac signalling^{52,55}. The role of STAT3 in Met signal transduction is controversial. Although direct binding of STAT3 to Met and a requirement for STAT3 in the Met-dependent formation of branched tubules have been reported^{56}, other studies support indirect STAT3 activation and a function in anchorage-independent growth^{57,58}. Met-induced formation of branched tubules was also blocked by inhibition of the NF-κB pathway^{59}, and this inhibition might occur in the ERK/MAPK pathway. Finally, Met activation also resulted in nuclear translocation and signalling of β-catenin^{60,61}. This is an intriguing interaction that requires further investigation.

Finally, recent data indicate that Met can interact at the plasma membrane with the hyaluronon receptor CD44, β4-integrin, ezrin, the Fas receptor, semaphorin receptors, or E-cadherin to form distinct signalling platforms^{62-66}. These interactions might allow relocation of Met to specialized regions of the membrane and/or cause clustering with specific substrates. Although these interactions are potentially important for the specificity or robustness of Met signalling, genetic data that support their biological relevance are not available (see also below).

REVIEW S

Box 2 | Formation of branched tubules

Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) induces the formation of branched tubules from Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells that are grown in a collagen matrix or Matrigel (see figure). Tubules form from an initial cyst-like structure. Cells extend and arrange in chains that reach away from the cyst, and thereby transiently lose their polarity. When the cells regain polarity, tubules are formed from the cellular chains. Analysis by electron microscopy demonstrates the hollow nature of the tubules produced by MDCK cells^{15,34}. The formation of branched tubules is a complex morphogenic process and requires cell proliferation and movement, rearrangements of the cytoskeleton and of cell-cell junctional complexes, and remodeling of the cell matrix (see REF. 102 for a detailed analysis of this process and REF. 38 for a review on Met and branched tubules). Many organs are composed of networks of epithelial tubes, so the formation of branched tubules in culture resembles the development of epithelial networks during organogenesis.

mutant mice is responsible for the death of HGF/SF⁻/⁻ or Met⁻/⁻ embryos *in utero*^{16,17}. Although HGF/SF and Met are expressed in many epithelial organs, only those that express the highest levels of HGF/SF — the liver and placenta — during mouse development are directly affected in mutant mice. A reduced survival of sensory or sympathetic neurons and an impaired outgrowth of particular motor nerves were also observed in Met-mutant mice^{72}. Because indirect mechanisms, such as an insufficient supply of nutrients and oxygen caused by the placental defect, or an impaired development of innervation targets caused by the changes in muscle development, might contribute to these neuronal phenotypes in the Met mutant, conditional mutagenesis of Met in neural cell types will ultimately be required to understand the basis of these alterations.

Met signalling and motility  
The genetic analysis in mice showed a striking role for HGF/SF and Met in the regulation of cellular motility. During development, cells frequently migrate over long distances to their final target, where they form tissues and organs. An important subclass of skeletal muscle derives from long-range migrating progenitors. These migrating cells arose late in vertebrate evolution and are most prominent in tetrapods^{69}. They delaminate by EMT from an epithelial structure — the DERMOMYOTOME — which derives from the SOMITE (FIG. 7). In mice, skeletal-muscle-progenitor cells migrate to the limbs, the tongue and the diaphragm, where they differentiate to form skeletal muscle. Ablation of the HGF/SF or Met genes results in the complete absence of all muscle groups that derive from migrating progenitor cells^{18}. This is caused by a lack of delamination of the migratory progenitors, which remain in the dermomyotome^{73} (FIG. 7). Mechanistically, the release of the muscle progenitor cells resembles the process that occurs during progression of carcinomas, in which invasive cells are released from the primary tumour by EMT, and then migrate to distant sites to form secondary tumours (see below).

Reflecting the late evolutionary appearance of Met and HGF/SF, the functions carried out by this signalling system in the embryo relate to processes such as placentation and liver development, which also arose late in evolution. Similarly, the generation of muscle progenitors that take up long-range migration is new in vertebrate evolution and first arose in bony fish, concomitant with the necessity to bring an increased number of muscle progenitor cells to the extremities. During the release and migration of these cells, HGF/SF is expressed in a highly dynamic pattern — first, in the mesenchyme close to the epithelium that delaminates the migrating cells; and subsequently, along the routes and at the targets^{73}. This pattern of HGF/SF expression indicates that Met signalling not only controls delamination, but is also important during migration. Delamination of cells also occurs during other developmental events — for example, in the formation of NEURAL CREST CELLS or the mesoderm. As yet, mutational analysis has implicated Met only and FGF receptor 1 signals in the delamination of cells from epithelial structures in the embryo. Other receptor tyrosine kinases, such as ErbB receptors, Ret and Kit, have been implicated in controlling motility *in vivo*, but not in the release of migrating cells.

Met signalling in the adult  
HGF/SF and Met are broadly expressed in adult tissues and have been implicated in postnatal physiological and pathophysiological processes. Upregulated HGF/SF and Met expression is observed in several injured tissues. For instance, after liver, kidney or heart injury, plasma levels of HGF/SF rise, and increased HGF/SF expression can be observed in the damaged, but also in other, organs^{74-77}. This indicates that upregulation of HGF/SF might be part of a general, defensive physiological response to tissue damage, and it is interesting to note that cytokines such as interleukin-1 and interleukin-6 activate HGF/SF transcription^{74}. HGF/SF has cytoprotective activity *in vivo*, and ectopic application prior to, or shortly after, tissue insult protects against various types of tissue injury^{75,78,79}. Various transgenic experiments support the notion that HGF/SF is a potent liver mitogen *in vivo*, and ectopic application or transgenic expression of HGF/SF stimulates proliferation of hepatocytes, increases the overall liver size and enhances liver regeneration^{74}. So therapeutic application of HGF/SF in liver,

lesions<sup>83</sup>(TABLE 1; see also Onlinetable 1 and HGF/SF, Met and cancer today in Online links). Third, a large number of studies show that HGF/SF and/or MET are frequently expressed in CARCINOMAS, in other types of human solid tumours and in their metastases, and that HGF/SF and/or Met over- or misexpression often correlates with poor prognosis (TABLE 1). Although quantification of MET expression is difficult and some studies do not distinguish between normal expression in epithelia and overexpression in carcinomas, the correlation between expression and prognosis is convincing. Fourth, unequivocal evidence that implicates MET in human cancer is provided by the activating mutations that have been discovered in both sporadic and inherited forms of human renal papillary carcinomas<sup>84</sup>. Such mutations, which alter sequences within the kinase domain (FIG. 8), have also been found more recently in other types of cancer and metastatic lesions (TABLE 1).

**MET activation in cancer.** Activation of MET in cancer occurs most often through ligand-dependent autocrine or paracrine mechanisms. For instance, OSTEOSARCOMAS and GLIOBLASTOMA MULTIFORME express both MET and HGF/SF (TABLE 1). Many types of carcinoma also express or overexpress MET, but in these tumours, the ligand is expressed not by tumour cells, but rather in the stroma (TABLE 1). So, in these tumours, MET activation could occur in a paracrine manner. Ligand-independent activation of receptor tyrosine kinases is typically observed in cells that express high levels of receptor, and might be significant in cancer<sup>85</sup>. Further, it is interesting to note that other oncogenes such as activated RAS can induce MET overexpression through transcriptional mechanisms<sup>86,87</sup>. Collectively, these are compelling arguments for MET and HGF/SF being causative in the development of most human cancers (TABLE 1). Furthermore, the well characterized activities of MET and HGF/SF — proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis and anti-apoptosis<sup>44,54,64,80,81,88–90</sup> — delineate the stages at which these molecules might participate in tumour progression.

MET is not only a marker for cancer (BOX 3), but it is also a marker of biological significance for malignancy (TABLE 1), and molecules that inhibit MET and HGF/SF can therefore be expected to interfere with the molecular causes of cancer. What are the possibilities for therapeutic intervention with MET as a target?

**MET and cancer therapy.** Many efforts are directed towards the development of small, low-molecular-weight biological inhibitors of HGF/SF and Met. Small molecules could inhibit Met catalytic activity<sup>91</sup> or the interaction between Met and downstream signalling molecules such as Grb2 (REF. 92) or Gab1. The GELDANAMYCIN antibiotics downregulate the expression of Met and inhibit HGF/SF-induced activation of the proteinase plasmin<sup>93</sup>; geldanamycin is now in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer. Furthermore, antagonistic antibodies against Met<sup>94</sup>, neutralizing antibodies against HGF/SF<sup>95</sup>, or antagonistic versions of HGF/SF such as NK4 (a fragment containing the amino-terminal and the K1-K4

Figure 6 | **Met signalling.** Activation of Met results in the recruitment of scaffolding proteins like Gab1 (growth-factor-receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2)-associated binder 1) and Grb2, which activate Shp2, Ras and ERK/MAPK. This causes changes in gene expression of cell-cycle regulators (such as the retinoblastoma protein pRB, Cdk6 and p27) and extracellular-matrix proteinases (such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA)), and in alterations of cytoskeletal functions that control migration, invasion and proliferation. Ras-Rac1/Cdc42-PAK and Gab1-Crk-C3G—Rap1 activation also regulates cytoskeletal and cell adhesion molecules such as cadherins, Arp2/3, N-WASP, paxillin, integrins and focal adhesion kinase (FAK). Gab1-PI3K-Akt/PKB activation controls cell survival through inhibition of caspase-9 and Bad. The most complex biological response induced by Met — the formation of tubules — requires all signalling branches.

renal and heart disease has been advocated and is being explored. An additional activity of HGF/SF, in angiogenesis, might be of particular importance in cancer<sup>80</sup> (see also below).

**MET, HGF/SF and cancer**

Dysregulation of MET and HGF/SF signalling has emerged as a crucial feature of many human malignancies. The evidence for this is compelling and comes from several experimental approaches: first, mouse and human cell lines that ectopically overexpress HGF/SF and/or MET become tumorigenic and metastatic in athymic NUDE MICE<sup>81</sup>. Appositely, downregulation of MET or HGF/SF expression in human tumour cells decreases their tumorigenic potential<sup>82</sup>. Second, mouse models that express the receptor or ligand as a transgene develop different types of tumour and metastatic

GELDANAMYCIN  
A low-molecular-weight compound that binds to heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a highly conserved cytosolic protein in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells that functions as a chaperone. Geldanamycin inhibits Hsp90 function, which causes the proteasomal degradation of proteins that require the chaperone for maturation or stability. Geldanamycin therefore destabilizes proteins, such as Met, ErbB2, Bcr-Abl, or Akt/PKB, and can suppress tumour formation in animal models.

domains<sup>96</sup>) could be useful for the inhibition of Met signalling in tumours. There is concern about possible essential roles of Met in normal physiology, which arises because of its wide expression. Indeed, inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases can influence normal physiological functions, and side effects have been observed in patients who have been treated with Herceptin, an ErbB2 inhibitor. This notwithstanding, the therapeutic benefit of specific inhibitors of tyrosine kinases in cancer can be considerable, and Met is a prime target<sup>91,97–99</sup>. Ultimately, the availability of specific inhibitors of Met signalling will provide the validation for the importance of this signalling system in tumour progression and result, conceivably, in new and effective cancer therapy.

**Outlook**

Pivotal roles for MET and HGF/SF in development and cancer have been established. They provide a striking example of the mechanistic similarities in the control of growth and migration during embryogenesis and tumour progression. These findings indicate a key

**Figure 7 | Met and cell migration in vivo.** During normal development, myogenic precursor cells (red) are delaminated from the epithelial dermomyotome (DMy). These precursor cells migrate to specific targets — for example, the limb bud — where, in wild-type embryos (left side of figure) — they differentiate into myoblasts. In HGF/SF<sup>-/-</sup> or Met<sup>-/-</sup> embryos (right side of figure), the progenitor cells are not released, but remain in the dermomyotome.

Figure 8 | MET mutations identified in human tumours. Shown is a model of the MET kinase domain and the positions of the activating mutations that have been identified in human tumours. Three conserved loops known as catalytic, activation and P+1 loops are shown in pink, dark blue and green, respectively, and correspond to sequences containing catalytic residues (pink), autophosphorylation sites (dark blue) and residues important for specificity in substrate binding (green). The mutations with the strongest transforming activities are located in the P+1 (M1250T) and the activation loop (D1228N/H and Y1230H/D/C), and are indicated in red. Other mutations are marked in yellow and lilac, and have intermediate and low transforming activity, respectively<sup>106</sup>. The model of the MET kinase domain is based on the crystal structure of the insulin receptor<sup>107</sup>, and it predicts that mutations in the activation loop increase the kinase activity by stabilizing conformations that allow substrate binding. For the other mutations, mechanisms have also been proposed<sup>108</sup>, although additional structural and biochemical data will be required in order to fully understand their activity.

Met mainly uses the Gab1 scaffolding adaptor in its initial step of signal transmission. Well characterized downstream signalling pathways that are activated by Met include the ERK/MAPK, PI3K–Akt/PKB, Crk–Rap and Rac–Pak pathways, resulting in proliferation and increased cell survival on the one hand, and complex motogenic and morphogenic cellular responses on the other. As yet, only the role of Gab1 in Met signal transduction has been analysed genetically. In the future, genetic analysis by conditional gene ablation will be useful in assessing the role of other downstream molecules, such as Shp2, JNK, STAT3 and NF-κB. These experiments are essential because traditional biochemical studies that rely on the overexpression of individual signalling components can overestimate their contribution to signalling.

Gene targeting in mice has allowed the determination of the developmental roles of Met and HGF/SF, such as the essential function in the formation of the

Box 3 | Hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor, Met and cancer diagnosis

Classical immunohistochemical analysis of tumour specimens requires high quality and reproducible reagents such as monoclonal antibodies directed against a specific determinant. Antibodies that are currently available are unsuitable for detecting MET in a routine pathological laboratory, but new diagnostic procedures with far greater resolving power and information content are now available. These range from tissue arrays that allow retrospective evaluation of MET and hepatocyte growth factor/scatter factor (HGF/SF) expression in many tumours simultaneously, to gene expression microarray analyses and proteomic technology for measuring MET or HGF/SF messenger RNA or protein levels. The frequency of occurrence and stage of appearance of tumour markers are still the standard for prognostic value, but microarray profiling has been already approved in the Netherlands for risk assessment in breast cancer<sup>103</sup>.

The use of these new diagnostic technologies improves the classification of tumours on the basis of the genes expressed, and predicts, with greater certainty, the metastatic risk. Available evidence strongly indicates that MET can be used as a prototype for metastatic-risk stratification using NUCLEAR IMAGING<sup>104</sup>. Already, various human tumour cell lines that have been propagated as xenografts in mice have been visualized over a period of several days with radiolabelled MET-specific monoclonal antibodies, which located and sized the tumour, and simultaneously assessed MET expression levels<sup>104</sup>. This goes beyond the classical uses of RADIOIMMUNOSCINTIGRAPHY with tissue-specific antibodies, as it also offers the possibility to assess the risk of metastasis. Clearly, the powerful new, non-invasive imaging technologies will allow real-time assessment of new therapies<sup>105</sup>.

placenta, liver and skeletal muscle. The assessment of functions in adult physiology or pathophysiology in Met and HGF/SF mutants was precluded by the severe developmental deficits in such mice, and has relied therefore on the application of exogenous ligand, or overexpression of ligand or receptor by transgenic technologies. The availability of Met alleles that can be used for conditional mutagenesis using the CRE/LOXP technology now makes it possible to analyse such processes genetically, and assess, for example, tumour progression or metastasis in the absence of a functional Met receptor.

Met was initially identified as an oncogene, and subsequent work established its role in the development of cancer. It is clear that new therapeutics are needed for the treatment of cancer, and that HGF/SF and MET are important targets. In this review, several approaches have been discussed that point the way for the development of MET-based therapies for cancer, and recent successes with Gleevac and Herceptin<sup>100,101</sup> are proof that new and effective anti-cancer agents can be developed on the strength of an understanding of the molecules and mechanisms that cause cancer.

Essential role for the c-met receptor in the migration of myogenic precursor cells into the limb bud. *Nature* **376**, 768–771 (1995). Limb muscles develop from cells that migrate from the somites. The authors report here that in Met-homozygous-mutant-mouse embryos, myogenic precursor cells do not invade the limb buds and, as a consequence, skeletal muscles of the limbs do not form. By contrast, development of the paraxial skeletal muscles proceeds in the absence of Met.
