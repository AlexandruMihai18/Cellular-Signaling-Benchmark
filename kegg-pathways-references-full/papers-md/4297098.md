## I. INTRODUCTION

"Our knowledge of the function and fate of the various sulfur-containing compounds is incomplete and can be likened to an unfinished mosaic." This

quotation from a recent review by Dziewiatkowski (229) appears to be particularly applicable to taurine and its related compounds. Although taurine has been known as a constituent of living organisms since 1827 (680) and may have existed before the origin of life (170), little is known about its physiological importance.

This review attempts to clarify the “unfinished mosaic” by compiling the current information about taurine and its derivatives. Section III tabulates and discusses the available data on the occurrence of taurine in biological systems. Taurine occurs widely, perhaps ubiquitously, in animals, often in tissue concentrations exceeding those of most other amino acids. The pathways of taurine biosynthesis in species from *Mytilus* to Man are discussed in section IV, in which also the relative importance of different pathways in different species and tissues is assessed on the basis of current knowledge. The movement of taurine across cell membranes is considered in section V, and section VI deals with the conversion of taurine to other sulfur-containing compounds, such as taurocyamine, isethionic acid (ISA), inorganic sulfate, and the conjugation of taurine with bile acids.

Section VII reviews the available data on the concentration of taurine in human body fluids, the factors reported to affect the urinary excretion of taurine in man, and the conditions that may be associated with hyper- or hypotaurinuria. In section VIII an attempt is made to apply the information reviewed in earlier sections to the question: What is the functional importance of taurine and its immediate derivatives in animal and human physiology? Although a definitive answer may not yet be given, several current lines of investigation offer promise of contributing to our information concerning the role of taurine.

II. CHEMISTRY AND METHODS

The compounds with which this review is concerned are almost all chemically derived from ethanesulfonic or ethanesulfonic acid. A brief survey of chemical data relevant to each is presented here³.

Taurine, 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is a colorless compound, crystallizing as tetragonal needles; molecular weight 125; m.p. 328 C (decomp.) (26). It is soluble in water (10.48 g/100 ml at 25 C) but almost insoluble in ethanol and ether. At 25 C, pKₐ is 1.5 and pKₐ 8.74 (23, 26). The dielectric coefficient at a pH of 2.8 is 41–45 (111, 214).

Taurine may be obtained either by organic synthesis (26) or from natural sources such as ox bile or the abalone (600) or other molluscs. Methods for estimating taurine include those procedures used generally for determination of amino acids (209, 215, 299, 300, 366, 374, 495, 496, 635), as well as more specific methods (273, 437, 531, 533, 628). Comparative studies of methods for estimating taurine are limited to those of Sörbo (628), who found good agreement between his results and those of Ling (437), whereas the method developed by Pentz

et al. (533) gave values 20–50% higher. In a few studies, taurine has been determined by isotope dilution (20, 51, 337).

Hypotaurine, 2-aminoethanesulfonic acid, is a colorless compound; molecular weight 109, m.p. 171–178 C (26, 129). It is very soluble in water and moderately soluble in methanol and acetone (60). pK<sub>a</sub> is 2.16 and pK<sub>b</sub> 9.56. A number of methods for the organic synthesis of hypotaurine have been described (36, 103, 117, 129, 236, 627). Estimation of hypotaurine has been done by ion-exchange chromatography (60) and by colorimetry (648)

Taurocyamine, 2-guanidoethanesulfonic acid, is a colorless compound; molecular weight 167, m.p. 224–230 C (217, 670). It is soluble in water and insoluble in ethanol and ether (217). Synthesis of taurocyamine has been accomplished by guanidylation of taurine with cyanamide (217, 239) or S-methyl-isothiourea (668).

Hypotaurocyamine, 2-guanidoethanesulfonic acid, is a colorless compound; molecular weight 151, m.p. 183–184 C. It is soluble in water and insoluble in ethanol (567). Like taurocyamine, hypotaurocyamine may be synthesized by guanidylation of hypotaurine with S-methyl-isothiourea (567).

Both guanido derivatives can be identified by their behavior in a variety of chromatographic systems (566, 567, 675, 676). Methods for the identification and isolation of the corresponding phosphagens, phosphataurocyamine and phosphohypotaurocyamine, have been described by Roche et al. (567, 570, 675–677).

Isethionic acid (ISA), 2-hydroxyethanesulfonic acid, is a colorless syrupy liquid; molecular weight 126, m.p. approx. 100 C (decomp.). It is soluble in water and ethanol and insoluble in ether (392). pK<sub>a</sub> is 2–2.3 (392, 707). Methods for the synthesis of sodium and potassium isethionate have been described by Gibbs (278) and, more recently, by Lauer and Hill (423). Sodium isethionate melts at 192–194 C and has been identified by X-ray diffraction and infrared spectrometry (392, 707), as well as by the behavior of ISA in a number of paper chromatographic systems. These are: *n*-butanol:0.9 N sulfuric acid (1:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.26 (392); *n*-propanol:ammonia:water (6:3:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.70 (108); *n*-butanol:glacial acetic acid:water (45:25:30, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.42 (707); ethanol:M ammonium acetate (2.5:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.55–0.60 (unpublished data); *n*-butanol:*n*-propanol:water (1:1:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.23–0.25 (unpublished data); *n*-butanol:glacial acetic acid:water (3:1:1, w/w), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.06–0.08 (unpublished data); *n*-butanol:acetic acid:water (12:3:5, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.50 (284); *n*-butanol:pyridine:water (1:1:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.58 (284); tertiary butanol:pyridine:water (1:1:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.75 (284); and isobutanol:pyridine:water (1:1:1, v/v), R<sub>F</sub> for ISA = 0.51 (284).

ISA can be quantitatively determined after conversion to inorganic sulfate and estimation of the latter with Ba(OH)<sub>2</sub> (707). Recently, a double isotope derivative technique has been developed for the quantitative determination of ISA (336). The method, which has only been described in outline, allows accurate and reproducible determination of as little as 1 nanomole of ISA.

Carbamyltaurine, 2-ureidoethanesulfonic acid, is a hygroscopic compound, forming square, shining, leaflike crystals; m.p. is 180–200 C (588). A method for the synthesis of carbamyltaurine has been described by Salkowski (589).

April 1968                                                                 TAURINE                                                                 427

Thiotaurine, 2-aminoethanethiosulfonic acid, is a crystalline compound, m.p. 214 C. Its synthesis, identification, and chromatographic behavior have been reported by Cavallini et al. (122) and by Sörbo (627).

III. OCCURRENCE OF TAURINE AND TAURINE DERIVATIVES

Tiedemann and Gmelin were the first to report the presence of taurine in living material. They isolated a compound from ox bile, which they named bile-asparagine (680). Twenty years passed before Redtenbacher showed that this compound contained sulfur (555). Evidence for the presence of taurine in tissues from a number of invertebrate and vertebrate species gradually accumulated over the next decades (178, 259, 357, 408–412, 428, 434, 435, 636, 688–690). Toward the end of the 19th century, surveys by Krukenberg (409) and von Fürth (271) indicated that taurine had a wide distribution in animals. This view has been fully supported by numerous reports on the distribution and occurrence of amino acids published in this century. Although no information appears to be available on the occurrence of taurine in some invertebrate phyla, i.e., Platyhelminthes and Aschelminthes, the published data justify the conclusion that taurine occurs universally in animals. In contrast, taurine and its derivatives appear to have a very limited distribution in plants. Details regarding the occurrence and distribution of taurine and its derivatives in plants and animals are presented below and in Tables 1–4.

A. Occurrence in Plants

Table 1 lists genera from phyla of plants in which taurine or taurine derivatives have been identified. In the phylum Thallophyta, taurine or taurine derivatives are found mainly in Rhodophyceae, a subclass of algae of predominantly marine or sublittoral ecology. No taurine is found in other algae, such as Chlorophyceae (241, 253), which live mainly in fresh water, or in Alaria (subclass Phaeophyceae) (241), Vaucheria (sc. Heterokontae) (241) or Anabaena (sc. Schizophyceae) (253). A few genera of fungi contain taurine (179, 270, 369), and others of the subclasses Ascomycetes, Phycomycetes, and Hyphomycetes have been shown to grow on media containing taurine as sole source of sulfur (98, 334, 462). In higher plants, taurine has been identified in pollen from five dicotyledonous genera (464), whereas no taurine was found in extracts from species of the genera Fumaria, Equisetum, Pinus, or Malus (457) or in extracts from potatoes (210). No other reports on the presence of taurine in plants were noted. Indeed, a recent article suggested the use of taurine as chromatographic reference in analyses of plant extracts (356).

B. Occurrence in Animals

1. Protozoa

The only protozoa in which taurine has been identified are certain strains of Tetrahymena (see ref. 441, in which the general subject of free amino acids in protozoa is reviewed in detail).

2. Metazoa

The genera from invertebrate phyla, vertebrates, and 10 of the mammals in which taurine and taurine derivatives are known to occur are listed, according to the Rothschild classification (580), in Tables 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Some of the data in Table 2 are described in recent reviews of the distribution of free amino acids in invertebrates (41, 378, 620).

a. Porifera. Taurine has been identified in eight genera of this phylum, most of which also contain hypotaurine (566) or one or more taurine derivative (Table 2). The sponge *Calyx nicagenesis* is the only animal in which mono- and dimethyltaurine have been identified (11); otherwise these derivatives are found only in red algae (436). Another sponge, *Geodia gigas*, is the first living organism in which trimethyltaurine or taurobetaine has been identified (9, 10).

b. Cnidaria. Eight genera of the class Anthozoa have been shown to contain taurine (Table 2); in one, *Renilla kollikeri*, it is present in high concentrations (378). Taurobetaine makes its second appearance in biological systems in *Briareum* (176).

* T = taurine; TB = taurobetaine; TC = taurocyamine; TC-P = taurocyamine phosphate; DMT = dimethyltaurine; HT = hypotaurine; HTC = hypotaurocyamine; HTC-P = hypotaurocyamine phosphate; ISA = isethionic acid; MMT = monomethyltaurine.

† Except where noted.

‡ Names of subclasses have been omitted, and orders are listed instead.

In earlier studies taurine was reported to be absent from the coelenterates *Vellela* (class Hydrozoa) (308) and *Cyanea* (class Scyphozoa) (492).

c. Polyzoa-Brachiopoda-Sipuncula. Little is known about taurine in species of these phyla (Table 2); however, taurocyamine and hypotaurocyamine are found in two genera of the small phylum Sipuncula (567, 570, 670, 675, 678). The formation of these guanido compounds is discussed in section v, C, and their role in section VIII, B.

d. Mollusca. Taurine is present, often in considerable amounts, in a large number of molluscs (Table 2). As pointed out by Awapara in his review of free amino acids in invertebrates (41), taurine occurs primarily in molluscs of marine habitat and is not found in a number of molluscs living in fresh water or on land (41, 620), nor is it detectable in the blood and tissues of the land gastropod *Helix aspersa* (370). The presence of taurine in invertebrates of marine habitat but not in freshwater animals suggests a role for taurine in osmoregulation (620). This is discussed in section VIII, A.

April 1968                                                                 TAURINE                                                                 433

Of compounds related to taurine, hypotaurine has been identified in two genera of the class Bivalvia, Ostrea (663), and Septifer (525, 617), and ISA occurs in high concentrations in the axoplasm of squids (199, 202, 390–392).

e. Annelida. Free taurine has been identified in only a few genera of this phylum (1, 378, 419), whereas a large number of genera of the class Polychaeta contain taurine derivatives (Table 2). The general subject of phosphagens in invertebrates has been reviewed in several recent articles (240, 671, 673). From the extensive review by Thoai and Robin (671) it is apparent that taurocyamine and taurocyamine-phosphate characteristically occur in sedentary polychaetes, but are absent from errant polychaetes. It is of interest that taurocyamine is found in the eggs but not in the tissues of Audouinia tentaculata (568), although adult forms contain taurine in considerable amounts (419). In the report by Robin et al. (568), Audouinia was classified as a sedentary polychaete, but in the classification used in the present review (580), Audouinia is assigned to the order Cryptophthalma.

f. Arthropoda. CLASS INSECTA. The genera of insects in which taurine has been found are listed in Table 2. Some insects, however, apparently do not contain taurine (16, 34, 166). The levels of amino acids in insect tissues are known to vary with the stage of development (166). Variations in taurine content have been noted in Bombyx (394, 722), Ephestia (168), and Culex and Aedes (491). It has been suggested that the tissue content of taurine increases at metamorphosis, presumably because of proteolysis (34).

CLASS CRUSTACEA. A fairly large number of genera of this class have been examined (Table 2). In particular, species from the order Decapoda characteristically contain large amounts of taurine in muscle and nerve tissue. The possible role of taurine as an inhibitor of nerve impulses is discussed in section VIII, C.

Other arthropod classes have not been studied extensively with regard to the presence of taurine. Stevens et al. (644) found the serum levels of free amino acids and of taurine to be much lower in the King crab, Limulus Polyphemus (class Merostomata), than in the crustaceans Cancer and Homarus, and ascribed this difference to the less advanced development of Limulus.

g. Echinodermata. As in molluscs, taurine in echinoderms may be confined to those of marine habitat (620), although the number of species examined is small (Table 2). Asterias is unique in nature in containing the taurine derivative asterubin or dimethylguanidinotaurine (2). Asterias is also one of the few animals in which a definite role of taurine in osmoregulation has been demonstrated (343, 344) (see section VIII, A).

h. Chordata. Taurine has been identified in various tissues of the urochordate Ciona intestinalis (8, 245, 378) and in the cephalochordate Amphioxus (378). No other species from these two primitive subphyla of Chordata appear to have been studied.

listed in the review by Haslewood (305) as excreting taurine-conjugated bile acids, is shown in Table 3. The occurrence of taurine and other amino acids in nervous tissue of chordata has recently been summarized by Tallan (660).

PISCES. Phylogenetically, the conjugation of bile acids with taurine is a characteristic first appearing in species of the true fishes (305), although high taurine concentrations are found in selachian liver (62). Taurine is present in various tissues of a large number of genera of true fishes, including many living in fresh water (618 and others). In some genera, e.g., *Crysohrys* and *Mugil*, taurine is the major ninhydrin-positive compound in muscle (396). The contents of taurine in muscle may vary with the season, as in *Gadus* (348) and *Clupea* (329), and with the stage

of development, as in *Salmo* (186), whereas no consistent changes in taurine concentration are observed with changes in the salinity of the surrounding water or after prolonged fasting (185). The general subject of amino acids in fish has recently been reviewed (183).

AMPHIBIA AND REPTILIA. Amphibian muscle has a high content of taurine (51, 106, 286), the levels in some species varying with the salinity of the surrounding water (286). In contrast, brain taurine levels in amphibians are considerably lower than levels found in invertebrates, teleosts, and reptiles (542), and no influence on taurine concentration of variations in surrounding salinity is demonstrable (52). In the reptile *Geoclymus reevesi*, brain taurine levels decrease about 80% during hibernation (28, 518)

AVES. Extensive information about the occurrence of taurine in birds is available only for domestic fowl (Table 3). The chicken embryo synthesizes taurine along pathways discussed in section iv, B. Taurine concentration in the embryo increases from 0.25 to 10 μmoles/100 mg dry protein in the first 4 days, after which total taurine content remains stable, even though the concentration in embryonic heart tissue continues to increase (281). Taurine content of muscle is higher in the embryo than in the 2- to 3-week-old chicken (712). The elevated levels of taurine found in muscle of chickens of the New Hampshire strain, which have hereditary muscular dystrophy, have been attributed to the persistence of embryonic characteristics in the dystrophic muscle tissue (538, 712). A relationship between the taurine content and degree of activity of muscle is suggested by the observations of Bascheri and Fromageot (51), who found that in *Perdix perdix* not yet capable of flight, the concentration of taurine in wing muscle was only 10% of that in muscles of the feet.

MAMMALIA. Taurine, free or conjugated with bile acids, occurs in a wide variety of mammals as shown in Table 3. For 10 mammals, including man, tissue taurine levels under various circumstances are known in considerable detail and are presented separately in Table 4. The remainder of this section reviews the available information on factors affecting taurine levels in tissues of these 10 genera.

Man. Of the mammals under consideration, least is known about taurine concentrations in human tissues, other than blood, which is dealt with in section vii, A. Taurine concentrations are higher in fetal human brain than in brain tissue from children and adults (520). Analyses of different sections of human brain show the highest concentrations of taurine in the frontal and occipital lobes (520). The levels of taurine in brain specimens from patients with brain tumor, tuberous sclerosis (520), Lowe’s syndrome, unspecified mental retardation (725), and mongolism (personal communication, W. L. Nyhan) do not differ significantly from levels in normal human brain. Taurine content is also higher in fetal human liver than in adult liver (585). Taurine levels in adult human liver are intermediate between the high levels in carnivorous animals like the dog, cat, and rat, and the low or absent levels in herbivorous animals like the rabbit and guinea pig (Table 4).

Rabbit. With the exception of heart tissue, taurine levels in rabbit tissues are low compared with those in other mammals. Taurine is either absent or present in only small amounts in rabbit liver (37, 40, 222, 626) and is not used for con-

jugation with bile acids in this species (305). The content of taurine in rabbit muscle is not changed by experimentally induced deficiency of vitamin E, although other amino acids increase in concentration (626, 658). The concentration of taurine in rabbit plasma has been reported to increase after treatment with cortisone (222), epinephrine, and ephedrine (586) and to decrease after administration of acetylcholine, chlorpromazine, veratrum, and hexamethonium (586). Like other mammals, rabbits excrete increased amounts of taurine in the urine after exposure to X rays (24, 25).

Mouse. Although quantitative data on taurine levels in mouse tissues are limited, taurine has been demonstrated in most tissues by paper chromatography (557, 563). The content of taurine is higher in fetal mouse brain than in adult brain (558), but is similar in heart tissue from embryo, newborn, and adult mice (559). The excretion of taurine in the urine appears to vary considerably from one genetic strain to another (279, 285, 302), and the interstrain variation cannot be eliminated by placing animals of different strains on identical diets or in similar surroundings (302). A possible defect in tubular reabsorption of taurine in certain strains of mice was thought to be excluded by the finding of a taurine spot of normal intensity in chromatograms of serum from mice with a high taurine excretion (302).

Urinary taurine excretion in mice has been shown to increase after injection of β-amino acids such as β-alanine and β-aminoisobutyric acid (β-AIB) (279). This observation supports other evidence, discussed in section v, pointing to the existence in biological systems of a transport system specific for β-amino acids, including taurine, and raises the question whether strains of mice excreting taurine in large amounts also excrete higher than normal amounts of other β-amino acids. No generalized aminoaciduria was noted in the studies cited above (302), but quantitative information, including clearance data, is needed to settle this question.

Finally, the excretion of taurine in mice increases after irradiation. This increase is also observed in irradiated splenectomized mice. Surprisingly, splenectomized mice serving as controls also show an increase in taurine excretion (485). An explanation for this observation is not readily apparent.

Rat. Extensive information is available on taurine (Table 4) and factors influencing taurine levels in rat tissues. Schram has estimated that taurine constitutes 0.15 % of the total body weight of the rat, a value that corresponds to 1200 μmoles/100 g body weight (604). Using an isotope dilution method, Boquet and Fromageot arrive at a somewhat lower estimate of 663 ± 60 μmoles/100 g (92). The highest concentrations of taurine are found in the heart, the muscles, which contain 75 % of total body taurine (642), the spleen, the bone marrow, and the thymus. Factors of importance in determining the concentrations of taurine are discussed below.

1) Sex. Most studies indicate that the taurine content of liver in the female is about twice that in the male (see Table 4 for references). Taurine levels in the female range, however, have been reported in male liver in a few instances (20, 336), and one study has reported very low levels in some female rats (92). Other
tissues in the female also apparently contain more taurine than the corresponding tissues in the male, e.g., thyroid (20), pituitary (20), adrenals (20, 92), and gonads (20, 40, 43, 92, 226, 273). Lung appears to be the only tissue in which taurine levels are higher in the male than in the female (20, 92, 273). Other tissues such as brain, heart, kidney, and muscle contain variable but similar amounts of taurine in both sexes.

2) Age. Taurine levels in the brain are higher in newborn rats than in adult rats (515). The content of taurine in rat brain is reported to decrease with advancing age (273, 515), although these changes were not observed in some studies (502, 659). In contrast, increases in taurine content with age have been noted in muscle, heart, and spleen (273). In liver, taurine content is higher in the newborn than in the fetus (607).

3) Fasting. This may lead to changes in the taurine content of some tissues. Thus, plasma levels have been reported to rise (718), although not by all investigators (244). With fasting, taurine content increases in the liver and muscle of male rats (40, 718), but decreases in the liver of female rats (38, 40). Brain taurine levels may decline (40, 212) or remain unchanged (521) during fasting. The levels of taurine in kidney, heart, spleen, testis, and thymus are not affected by fasting (40, 377, 559).

4) Vitamins. The urinary excretion of taurine increases in rats made deficient in pantothenate (399, 463). In contrast, urinary excretion of taurine decreases, often markedly, in pyridoxine deficiency (83, 84, 165, 326, 399, 488, 510). This decrease is ascribed to a decrease in the activity of the pyridoxine-requiring enzymes that decarboxylate CSA and CA, the immediate precursors of taurine (see section iv, C). Pyridoxine deficiency, however, does not cause a decrease in the taurine content of rat brain, liver, spleen, or muscle (326, 327, 510). The persistence of normal taurine levels in the tissues of pyridoxine-deficient rats strongly suggests the existence of taurine-synthesizing pathways not involving decarboxylation of CSA and CA and also indicates that mechanisms may exist for maintaining taurine at normal levels.

5) Hormones. Although tissue taurine levels and urinary excretion of taurine may be modified by a variety of hormones, no systematic studies of the effect of hormones on the synthesis, transport, metabolism, and excretion of taurine have been reported. Hence, any conclusions drawn from the available data must remain tentative.

a) Adrenal steroids. Adrenalectomy is followed by a decrease in the taurine content of the liver of female rats; it has no effect on taurine levels in liver, kidney, muscle, or spleen of male rats (40), although an increase in the kidney was noted in one study (720). Urinary taurine excretion (and the specific activity of taurine excreted after injection of ${}^{35}$S-methionine) is significantly higher in adrenalectomized female rats than in sham-operated controls (532). The specific activity of excreted taurine returns to normal when adrenalectomized rats are treated with the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (532). After irradiation, adrenalectomized rats excrete significantly more taurine than normal rats (530). Taken together, these observations are compatible with the hypothesis that adrenalectomy diminishes

the ability of some rat tissues to retain exogenous or endogenously synthesized taurine. Direct support for this concept, however, is not available. In addition, the decline in taurine levels in the liver of female rats after adrenalectomy may result from a decrease in the activity of hepatic CSA-decarboxylase occurring after adrenalectomy (499).

b) Sex hormones. In ovariectomized rats the taurine content of the uterus decreases significantly after injection of estradiol (355). This observation probably reflects the well-known effect of estrogens on protein synthesis (500). As mentioned previously, the levels of taurine in the liver in female rats are about twice those in the male; after ovariectomy, however, the levels decrease toward those in male liver. Taurine levels in liver and other tissues of male rats do not increase after administration of estrogens (40). Theoretically, the higher hepatic levels of taurine in the female than in the male could result from any one of the following: *a)* higher activity of CSA-decarboxylase in the liver in females than in males, *b)* slower rate of taurine conjugation in the liver in females than in males, *c)* more rapid hepatic synthesis of taurine in the female than in the male along pathways other than those involving CSA and CA, and *d)* transfer of taurine from plasma into liver tissue at a more rapid rate in the female than in the male. From the available evidence, the first possibility appears to be excluded by numerous studies showing that CSA-decarboxylase activity is considerably lower in female than in male liver (62, 67, 157, 325, 625, 662) and rises toward male levels after ovariectomy (157–159, 625, 662). This is exactly the opposite of what would be expected if liver taurine levels were determined largely by the activity of the CSA-decarboxylase. Experimental evidence supporting or excluding any of the other three possibilities is not available at present, although the existence of alternate pathways of taurine synthesis in rat liver is well established (see section iv, C).

c) Other hormones. Taurine levels increase in muscle, kidney, and spleen after hypophysectomy (40), but the effect of individual pituitary hormones on taurine synthesis and metabolism is not known. Insulin, in doses sufficient to cause coma, has no effect on taurine levels in the brain (380, 521).

6) Drugs. The effect of psychotropic drugs on brain amino acids has recently been reviewed (502, 659). Brain taurine levels are unchanged after administration of reserpine (291, 502, 659), β-phenylisopropylmethylamine (521), imipramine, desmethyl-imipramine and hydroxylamine (659), Metrazol (717), and phenylcyclopropylamine (502). Chlorpromazine has been reported to cause an increase in brain taurine in one study (521) but not in another (659). Tissue taurine levels are not affected by administration of ammonium acetate (226, 717), ethanol (332), or cholic acid (38). Colchicine increases urinary taurine excretion without significantly lowering the taurine content of brain, heart, or skin (398). Plasmocid, a quinoline compound that produces muscle necrosis, also produces hypertaurinuria without demonstrably altering the taurine content of heart and muscle tissue (97, 288). Administration of malonate significantly increases the content of taurine in the spleen (377). Treatment with hydrazides that inhibit pyridoxine-requiring enzymes, such as isoniazid, is followed by decreases in urinary taurine excretion (458, 460, 461, 488) and biliary taurine (459); a decrease in brain taurine content was reported in one study (502) but not in another (373). After administration

tion of the hepatotoxic agents carbon tetrachloride and fluoroacetamide, plasma taurine levels increase significantly (382, 388).

7) Irradiation. The phenomenon of postirradiation hypertaurinuria is well documented in rats (13–15, 24, 25, 93, 94, 260, 288, 319, 353, 360–362, 364, 365, 483, 510, 530, 604, 605, 629, 642, 700) and has recently been reviewed in detail (266, 318). The mechanism responsible for such irradiation-induced increases is discussed in section VII, C. The origin of the excess taurine excreted after exposure to X rays or other forms of irradiation is not definitely known, although the bulk of the evidence points to preformed tissue taurine as the source (266). After irradiation, a decrease in taurine content was observed in the liver and kidney of normal rats in one study (260) and in the spleen of pyridoxine-deficient rats in another (510); in other studies no changes were demonstrable in brain, liver, muscle, or spleen (510, 642). The amount of excess taurine excreted after irradiation is relatively small. Since tissue taurine levels normally vary considerably (Table 4), failure to demonstrate a decrease in tissue taurine does not disprove that preformed tissue taurine is the source of the excess urinary taurine.

8) Miscellaneous observations. Brain taurine levels are unchanged after electroshock (502, 521). Evisceration does not appear to affect taurine levels in brain or heart (248). After partial hepatectomy, the taurine content of the regenerating liver falls rapidly, but normal levels are reestablished after 6 days (244, 561). Liver taurine levels are increased by dehydration in normal and thyroidectomized rats but not in diabetic rats (561). Rats recovering from experimental wounds excrete less taurine if they are given a protein-rich diet than if given a protein-deficient diet (711). As in mice, the administration of β-alanine and β-AIB to rats may be followed by an increase in taurine excretion (76, 398).

a) Guinea pig. Taurine levels in guinea pig tissues in general are similar to those found in the rabbit (40). In particular, taurine appears to be lacking in adult guinea pig liver, although it is present in fetal guinea pig liver and, to a lesser degree, in liver from newborn guinea pigs (687). The absence of taurine in adult guinea pig liver is consistent with the fact that almost all conjugates of guinea pig bile acids contain glycine (305). Taurine is excreted in the urine in amounts of 6–12 μmoles/100 g body weight per day (318), although earlier qualitative studies failed to identify taurine in guinea pig urine (196, 197). Urinary excretion of taurine decreases during fasting, suggesting an exogenous source for most of the taurine in guinea pig urine (318). In contrast to other mammals, taurine excretion is not increased in guinea pigs exposed to irradiation (24, 25, 318).

b) Dog. Quantitative data on taurine in dog tissues are limited. Taurine does not appear to have been measured in dog heart. This information would be of interest in view of recent evidence that taurine is synthesized from cystine in dog heart slices and serves as precursor for isethionic acid (552). Qualitatively, taurine appears to be more plentiful in auricular than ventricular tissue (559). Infarcted tissue appears to lose taurine after a certain time (142). After hepatectomy, plasma taurine levels increase (249), while the concentration of taurine in brain and muscle shows no definite changes (247).

The phenomenon of postirradiation hypertaurinuria has also been demon-

strated in dogs, although the pattern of taurine excretion differs in several respects from that in rats (24, 25).

c) Cat. Tallan et al. (661) have carried out quantitative analyses of amino acids in many cat tissues. Taurine is present in the liver in fairly high concentrations, even though cat liver is incapable of decarboxylating CSA or CA to any significant extent (79, 85, 325, 338). The cat preferentially uses taurine for conjugation with bile acids (305). It seems likely that the taurine moiety is either derived from the diet or synthesized along pathways not involving CSA and CA (see section IV, C). From results obtained by acid hydrolysis, Tallan et al. (661) concluded that part of the taurine in kidney tissue and urine of cats was present in bound form. More recently, Kaihara and Price isolated the compound quinaldylglycytaurine from cat urine (354, 499). Quinaldic acid is a metabolite of kynurenic acid, and the earlier observations suggest that quinaldylglycytaurine originates in the kidney.

In a qualitative survey, no taurine was found in the urine of the cat and other members of the Felidae, suggesting that the species of this family eliminate organic sulfur in the form of feline or cysteine-S-isopentanol (196, 197). More recent studies (289) have shown that cats receiving an adequate protein diet excrete both taurine and feline, whereas cats on a protein-deficient diet excrete only feline.

d) Pig, cattle, and sheep. Awapara has reported taurine levels in tissues from these three mammals (40). Taurine has also been identified by qualitative methods in many tissues of the calf embryo, the calf, and the cow (33, 285, 454, 698), although not in the urine (196, 197). Taurine levels in pig liver are in the range of those found in man, intermediate between the high levels in carnivores, which mainly excrete taurine-conjugated bile acids, and the low or absent levels in herbivores, which excrete mainly or exclusively glycine-conjugated bile acids. In accord with this, pig bile contains both types of conjugates, although glycine is used preferentially (305).

In summary, this section has attempted to collect the available information on the occurrence and distribution of taurine and its immediate derivatives in plants and animals. Taurine is found only to a very limited extent in plants, but is found in nearly all animal tissues so far studied. It is often present in considerable amounts. A number of factors influence the levels of taurine in a variety of animal tissues. These include age, sex, and stage of development of the animal, the type of tissue, and the habitat and nutrition of the animal. Several vitamins and hormones have also been shown to affect tissue taurine levels.

IV. BIOSYNTHESIS OF TAURINE

Various aspects of the metabolism of sulfur amino acids have been reviewed in the past 40 years (45, 86, 116, 154, 156, 180, 234, 263, 264, 429–431, 512, 528, 621). Informative discussions of taurine biosynthesis may be found in recent reviews by Dziewiatkowski (229), Kun (417), Meister (484), and Young and Maw

April 1968                                                                 TAURINE                                                                 447

(724) and should be consulted for details not included here. In this review emphasis is placed on comparative aspects of taurine biosynthesis, on studies dealing with the decarboxylase enzymes acting on CSA and CA, and on published evidence bearing on the existence of taurine-synthesizing pathways not involving CSA and CA.

Figure 1 shows the metabolic pathways through which taurine may originate in biological systems. For purposes of discussion, five pathways may be distinguished:

Pathway I: methionine-cysteine-cysteinesulfonic acid-hypotaurine-taurine  
Pathway II: methionine-cysteine-cysteinesulfonic acid-cysteic acid-taurine  
Pathway III: cysteamine/cystamine-intermediates-hypotaurine-taurine  
Pathway IV: sulfate-sulfite-intermediates-cysteic acid-taurine  
Pathway V: cystine-cystine disulfoxide-cystamine disulfoxide-hypotaurine-taurine  

Pathway I appears to be the main biosynthetic route to taurine, at least in many mammalian tissues, but sufficient evidence is at hand to indicate that taurine also may be synthesized along one or more of the other pathways in a variety of tissues.

### A. Biosynthesis in Invertebrates

Despite the widespread occurrence of taurine in invertebrates (Table 2), little is known about the biosynthesis of taurine in species of most invertebrate phyla. The immediate precursor is probably hypotaurine, which has been identified

in several species of Porifera and Cnidaria (525, 566), Mollusca (525, 617, 663), and Annelida (1). In a few species, the origin of hypotaurine and taurine has been examined by isotopic methods. Two molluscs, Mytilus edulis and Rangia cuneata, have been shown to convert ${}^{35}$S-methionine to cysteine, sulfate, and taurine. In Rangia, radioactivity was also found in CSA and CA, but not in hypotaurine, indicating the presence in this species of enzymes belonging to synthetic pathway II. In Mytilus, on the other hand, radioactivity was found only in hypotaurine, but not in CSA and CA, suggesting the presence of enzymes belonging to either pathway III or V, whereas neither pathway I nor II appears to be operative in this species (18). Support for this interpretation is found in studies by Bergeret and Chatagner (62) and by Blaschko (80), who were unable to demonstrate decarboxylase activity towards CSA or CA, respectively, in tissues from Mytilus.

Sulfur amino acid metabolism has also been studied in Arenicola cristata, a sedentary polychaete (1). Tissues of this species contained 0.48 μmole of CSA/g and converted ${}^{35}$S-methionine to a number of other sulfur compounds, including CSA, CA, hypotaurine, and taurine. Homogenates of Arenicola tissue liberated CO₂ from added CSA, and this reaction was heat labile. These findings indicate that Arenicola synthesizes taurine along pathway I. Conversion of ${}^{35}$S-cystine to hypotaurine by Arenicola has also been demonstrated by Thoai et al. (678). Since these workers did not report finding radioactivity in CSA or CA, the existence in Arenicola of additional taurine-synthesizing pathways cannot be excluded.

Several studies have explored the metabolism of sulfur compounds in two insect species, Musca domestica (181, 320) and Blatella germanica (88, 296, 314, 315). In Musca, both ${}^{35}$S-methionine and ${}^{35}$S-cystine are converted to taurine, with CSA, CA, and hypotaurine serving as intermediates (181, 320). This indicates the presence in Musca of enzymes subserving pathways I and II. In Blatella, ${}^{35}$S-cysteine and ${}^{35}$S-cystine are converted to taurine, with CA serving as intermediate (CSA was not studied). Blatella apparently synthesizes taurine along pathway I or II, and this applies to both xenic and aposymbiotic roaches (88, 315). In addition, xenic roaches can incorporate the sulfur moiety of inorganic sulfate into several organic sulfur compounds, including cysteine, apparently through a reduction of sulfate to sulfite, sulfide, and thiosulfate and condensation of these compounds with serine (88, 296, 314). Since cysteine is converted to taurine in xenic roaches, these insects possess all the metabolic steps necessary for converting inorganic sulfate to taurine, i.e., pathway IV is operative. It is important to realize, however, that this applies only to xenic roaches, since aposymbiotic roaches are incapable of converting inorganic sulfate to organic sulfur compounds, presumably because the reduction of sulfate requires the presence of xenic symbionts (88, 314).

### B. Biosynthesis in Nonmammalian Vertebrates

Little is known about the mode of synthesis of taurine in fish, amphibians, and reptiles, although taurine, as shown in Table 3, is found in a large number of species belonging to these classes. The few studies reported suggest that taurine synthesis does not take place along pathways I and II. No CSA-decarboxylase

activity could be demonstrated in tissues from the selachians Scyllium and Raja or the teleosts Labrus, Scomber, and Solea (62), and no CA-decarboxylase activity was found in cod liver (79). In studies with carboxyl-<sup>14</sup>C-labeled substrates, no evolution of radioactive CO₂ from CSA or CA occurred in homogenates of liver from the amphibian Bufo marinus (338). Further studies are clearly needed to establish the pathways responsible for taurine synthesis in these vertebrate classes.

The metabolism of sulfur amino acids and the synthesis of taurine have been extensively studied in domestic fowl, both the embryo and the adult. Taurine in this species is synthesized along at least three pathways. Studies in vitro and in vivo have shown that the chicken embryo converts <sup>35</sup>S-methionine and <sup>35</sup>S-cystine to taurine with CSA and CA as intermediates, whereas hypotaurine formation cannot be demonstrated (147, 148, 452). These findings are compatible with the view that the chicken embryo synthesizes taurine along pathway II and that pathway I is not available. Direct support for this view has been furnished by Simmonet et al. (619). These workers have shown that homogenates of liver, vitelline sac, heart, and brain from day-old chicken embryos are capable of decarboxylating CA but not CSA. The decarboxylation of CA by liver tissue, however, was strongly and competitively inhibited by CSA. From the data presented by these investigators, the apparent \( K_m \) for CA can be calculated to be about 5 × 10⁻³ M and the apparent \( K_i \) for CSA 5–6 × 10⁻⁴ M. It would appear, therefore, that the decarboxylase of embryonic chicken liver resembles that of rat liver in having a higher affinity for CSA than for CA, but differs in being inactive toward CSA.

Whether the inability of chicken liver to decarboxylate CSA is limited to the embryo or also applies to the liver of the hatched chicken and the hen is not settled. In recent studies Jacobsen et al. (338), using carboxyl-labeled CSA and CA as substrates, have demonstrated that nonembryonic chicken liver also shows a higher decarboxylase activity toward CA than toward CSA and that CSA strongly inhibits the decarboxylation of CA. In addition, nonembryonic chicken liver showed slight but definite CSA-decarboxylase activity, even under anaerobic conditions. This suggests either *a*) that nonembryonic chicken liver contains a CSA-specific decarboxylase not present in embryonic liver, in addition to the CA-specific decarboxylase demonstrated by Simmonet et al. (619) or *b*) that only one enzyme is present, which acts preferentially on CA but also decarboxylates CSA to a small extent and is demonstrable only by sensitive methods. Unfortunately, the ability of embryonic chicken liver to decarboxylate ¹-¹⁴C-CSA was not investigated in these studies (338).

Although taurine synthesis proceeds primarily along pathway II in chicken liver, it does not appear to do so in chicken brain. Here, decarboxylase activity toward CSA is higher than toward CA, as is the case in mammalian tissues (338). In chicken brain, therefore, taurine synthesis apparently proceeds along pathway I. The difference between chicken liver and chicken brain indirectly adds support to the evidence obtained from mammalian tissues that the decarboxylase enzymes of brain and liver of a given species are different proteins catalyzing the same reaction, i.e., isozymes (338).

Taurine synthesis in the chicken also occurs along pathway IV, the conversion

of inorganic sulfate to taurine. In 1955, Machlin and co-workers (450) showed that 65% of a dose of ${}^{35}$S-sulfate injected into 24-hr-old eggs of Rhode Island hens could be recovered in the taurine of the embryos 21 days later. Serial determinations of the specific activity of taurine showed a gradual decrease, indicating that other pathways of taurine synthesis became increasingly important with time. Independently in 1955, Lowe and Roberts (443) reported the rapid appearance of radioactive taurine in 11-day-old chicken embryos injected with ${}^{35}$S-sulfate. Subsequent work, in particular by Chapeville and Fromageot, has established that the conversion of inorganic sulfate to taurine involves three sequential reactions, as follows.

1) Reduction of sulfate to sulfite. This reaction occurs only in the cells lining the yolk sac (143, 150, 151). The reduction does not proceed beyond sulfite and is not inhibited by selenate (143, 297).

2) Fixation of sulfite to a three-carbon aminated molecule derived from L-cysteine, leading to the formation of L-CA. This reaction is catalyzed by extracts from the cells of the yolk sac, as well as from the yolk itself, but not by embryonic tissue extracts (143, 150, 151). The enzyme catalyzing this reaction has been named cysteinelyase (152). It is a pyridoxine-requiring enzyme with a pH optimum of 8–8.5 and contains no Fe, Cu, Mg, or Ca (143, 152). Its probable mechanism of action is to rupture the C—S bond of the $\beta$-carbon of cysteine, resulting in the removal of H₂S and the formation of an intermediate, tentatively identified as $\alpha$-amino-acrylic acid (143, 151, 152). This intermediate can react with different compounds such as cysteine, H₂S, or sulfite to form lanthionine, cysteine, and CA, respectively, or, in the absence of suitable reactive substances, may become hydrolyzed to ammonia and pyruvic acid (143, 152).

3) Decarboxylation of CA to form taurine. This reaction occurs in the yolk sac, the yolk, and tissues of the embryo itself (143, 147, 150, 151, 619). The reaction is inhibited by CSA (150, 619), glutamic acid (150), KCN, hydroxylamine, iodoacetate, and D,L-$\alpha$-methylcysteic acid (619).

Since the first two reactions in the conversion of inorganic sulfate to taurine require the participation of enzymes found only in the yolk sac and the yolk, pathway IV might be expected to be confined to the chicken embryo. Conversion of inorganic ${}^{35}$S-sulfate to taurine, however, has been demonstrated also in young chickens and in hens (287, 448, 465–469). There are at least two explanations for these observations. First, the conversion may proceed via cystine, which is known to be formed to a limited extent from inorganic sulfate in chickens and hens (447, 448, 451, 467–469). The reduction of sulfate to sulfite and its incorporation into cysteine are probably ascribable to the activity of bacteria in the gut (see e.g., refs. 467, 528). The possibility that cysteine may be formed from sulfate without the participation of bacteria cannot be excluded. Mason found that the amount of radioactivity in cystine after feeding ${}^{35}$S-sulfate to hens is the same, whether the hens are cecectomized or not (467, 468). Also, formation of cysteine from inorganic sulfate has recently been demonstrated in the chicken embryo (144, 345), although earlier studies failed to find evidence for this conversion (149, 450). It is apparent that inorganic sulfate may be converted to taurine through cysteine as an intermediate,

whatever the mechanism may be. The extent to which this occurs in the embryo, the young chicken, and the hen remains to be established. Alternatively, conversion of inorganic sulfate to taurine may proceed more directly in the hatched chicken and hen. The radioactivity in taurine in tissues and blood from chickens and hens fed ${}^{35}$S-sulfate is 5–15 times higher than in cystine (and methionine) (467, 468). In addition, taurine in the liver of young chickens given ${}^{35}$S-sulfate orally becomes labeled within 30 min, whereas labeling of cystine occurs later and to a much smaller extent (465). The pathway used for the conversion of sulfate to taurine in chickens and hens is unknown. In the studies just cited (465), preliminary observations suggested the formation of radioactive hypotaurine and possibly cysteamine. If these observations are confirmed, they suggest that the conversion of inorganic sulfate to taurine in the chicken and hen may proceed via cysteamine and hypotaurine, which are known to be precursors of taurine in several mammalian systems (see section iv, C).

In summary, taurine biosynthesis in domestic fowl appears to be of considerable complexity. At least three pathways are available in different tissues and at various stages of development. Further work will be required to delineate the quantitative relations between these pathways of taurine synthesis.

### C. Biosynthesis in Mammals

Many articles on the biosynthesis of taurine in mammalian tissues have appeared since von Bergmann in 1904 reported an increase in the excretion of taurocholic acid by dogs with bile fistulas fed cystine and cholic acid (68). Several recent reviews have dealt with taurine biosynthesis in considerable detail (417, 484, 724). In the present review, particular emphasis is given to two aspects of taurine biosynthesis: $a$) the distribution in different mammalian tissues and species of CSA- and CA-decarboxylases, active in the synthesis of taurine along pathways I and II, and $b$) the evidence currently available indicating synthesis of taurine along pathways III, IV, and V in mammals.

#### 1. Pathways I and II

These pathways are most conveniently considered together, since they differ only with regard to whether the immediate precursor of taurine is CA or hypotaurine.

Rigorous proof of the conversion of an unlabeled or labeled sulfur compound to taurine along any one of the five pathways would require demonstration of increased concentrations of radioactivity, or the appearance of radioactivity, in all intermediates occurring between the compound and taurine. By this criterion, only a few studies have unequivocally demonstrated synthesis of taurine along pathways I and II, although the individual steps in these pathways have been extensively studied both in vivo and in vitro. Because many intermediates have not been measured, the pathway through which precursors of taurine have been con-

verted to taurine can be surmised only, in particular when the precursor and taurine are separated by a number of metabolic steps. For example, in vivo studies have shown that methionine (664, 691), methionine sulfoxide (694), homocysteine (693), cysteine (35, 36, 46, 123, 472, 653, 673), and cystine (39, 118, 130, 136, 251, 252, 691) may serve as precursors of hypotaurine and taurine in several mammalian tissues and species. The lack of knowledge concerning the levels of possible intermediates, however, makes it impossible to determine whether the conversion of these compounds to hypotaurine and taurine has proceeded along pathways I, II, III, or V.

A limited number of in vivo studies have provided circumstantial evidence in favor of taurine synthesis along pathways I and II. Tabachnick and Tarver (654) observed the appearance of labeled cystathionine, CA, and taurine in the liver of rats injected with ${}^{35}$S-methionine, and Chapeville and Fromageot (146) demonstrated the presence of radioactive CSA and hypotaurine in the liver of rats injected with ${}^{35}$S-cystine. After administration of CSA, increases in the content of hypotaurine and taurine have been demonstrated in the liver of rats (39, 64, 155, 655) and dogs (692) and in the kidney (39, 655) and urine of rats (123, 165); however, CSA, in contrast to cysteine and cystine, did not alter the content of hypotaurine and taurine in rat heart, muscle, and spleen (39). After administration of CA, increased amounts of taurine have been found in the bile of dogs (692) and in the liver, kidney, and urine of rats but not rat heart and spleen (46, 123). Finally, after administration of hypotaurine to rats and mice, increases in the content of taurine in liver, kidney, plasma, urine, and, to a lesser extent, in heart muscle have been reported (39, 138, 235–237).

More definite evidence for the synthesis of taurine along pathways I and II has been provided by in vitro studies. Beginning with cysteine, the synthesis of taurine appears to require three metabolic reactions: $a$) oxidation of cysteine to CSA and CA; $b$) decarboxylation of CSA to hypotaurine and of CA to taurine; $c$) oxidation of hypotaurine to taurine.

$a$. Oxidation of cysteine to CSA and to CA. In earlier studies, the insoluble portion of rat liver homogenates was found to catalyze the oxidation of cysteine and cystine to CA (42, 72, 480, 481). The activity was low, and only one of the studies reported that CSA was formed in this reaction (42). In their study, Medes and Floyd concluded that CSA was not an intermediate (481). More recently, rat liver supernatant has been shown to contain an enzyme catalyzing the oxidation of cysteine to CSA (208, 630, 696). This enzyme requires aerobic conditions, Fe${}^{++}$, and NADPH, and possibly nicotinamide and hydroxylamine (208, 630). The pH optimum is between 7 and 9 (630, 696). The activity toward cystine is only 12% of that toward cysteine (696). In contrast to rat liver, cysteine oxidase activity could not be demonstrated in rat heart, kidney, spleen, or brain (696). Absence of activity in rat brain is surprising and cannot be accepted without confirmation, since it is the only mammalian tissue in which CSA has been detected without preloading the animal with CSA precursors (59). In addition, Peck and Awapara recently demonstrated the conversion of ${}^{35}$S-methionine to cysteine, CSA, and CA in rat brain slices and homogenates (529). Absence of cysteine oxidase activity in

rat heart, in conjunction with the lack of demonstrable CSA-decarboxylase activity in this tissue (338), indicates that pathways I and II are unavailable in rat heart tissue. If this is applicable to other mammals, the conversion of cysteine to taurine by dog heart preparations (552) must proceed by pathways other than I and II.

b. Decarboxylation of CSA to hypotaurine and CA to taurine. The first report demonstrating decarboxylation of CA in liver tissue from the rat and other mammals was that of Blaschko (79), although Medes and Floyd, in earlier studies, had noted some decarboxylase activity in rat kidney and intestines but not in rat liver (481, 482). During the next two decades, considerable work was done on the distribution and biochemistry of decarboxylases acting on CSA and CA in various mammalian tissues. The bulk of the currently available evidence indicates that decarboxylation of CSA occurs at a rate 2–8 times that of CA in all tissues and species in which decarboxylase activity is demonstrable (65, 198, 325, 336, 337, 631). This suggests that pathway I is the preferred pathway in the conversion of cysteine to taurine. In addition, the decarboxylation of CSA and CA appears to be catalyzed by the same enzyme, cysteinesulfinate carboxylase (E.C. 4.1.1.29), which occurs in biochemically different forms in the liver and the brain.

Table 5 summarizes the reported data on the CSA- and CA-decarboxylase activities in tissue from 10 mammalian species. Due to differences in methodology, comparison of reported activities is difficult or impossible, and the arbitrary classification of activities adopted in the table should serve only as a general guide. Studies dealing with the decarboxylation of CSA and CA are discussed in relation to each of the 10 mammalian species listed in Table 5.

IN MAN. Few reports on the decarboxylation of CSA and CA by human tissues have appeared (79, 337, 338, 438, 527). A soluble cell fraction from normal and cystinotic human liver has been reported to catalyze the decarboxylation of unlabeled CSA and CA (527); the rate observed corresponded to that reported in preparations of liver from guinea pigs and rabbits (66, 325). In contrast, in two studies on human tissue incubated with carboxyl-¹⁴C-labeled CSA and CA as substrates, virtually no release of radioactive CO₂ took place in specimens of liver obtained at autopsy or operation or by percutaneous biopsy (337, 438) or in kidney (79, 338). Slight but definite CSA- and CA-decarboxylase activity, however, was demonstrable in preparations from human brain (337). Thus, the decarboxylase activity of liver and brain in man and the cat is similar (Table 5), and the findings in both species support the view that the decarboxylases of liver and brain are different enzymes.

In addition, it appears that neither pathway I or II is of quantitative significance in the synthesis of taurine in human or cat liver.

IN THE RABBIT. Rabbit liver was the first mammalian tissue in which decarboxylation of CSA and formation of hypotaurine was demonstrated (58, 60, 155, 265), after earlier studies had failed to show any CA-decarboxylase activity (79). Subsequent work has established that rabbit liver is capable of decarboxylating both CSA and CA, although the enzyme activities are much lower than in rat and dog liver (66, 325). The enzyme in rabbit liver has a pH optimum of 6.8 and requires pyridoxine and a free SH-group for decarboxylation to occur. In vitro

addition of pyridoxine augments the activity toward CA but not toward CSA (66). Decarboxylase activity toward CSA and CA is also demonstrable in kidney and brain tissue, but not in rabbit heart (66).

IN THE MOUSE. The only tissue from this species to have been examined is the liver, which has been shown to decarboxylate CSA (85, 325).

IN THE RAT. Decarboxylase activity toward CSA and CA is high in rat liver

* The arbitrary classification of decarboxylase activities is based primarily on previously published quantitative data (337, 338). Values reported in the literature by others have been compared with these. 0 activity indicates that decarboxylation of CSA and/or CA was undetectable or insignificant even when \({}^{14}\)C-labeled substrates were used in the incubations; 4-plus activity indicates a rate of decarboxylation, which results in a \(q_{\text{CO}_2}\) (\(\mu\)l CO₂ formed/mg wet wt/hr) of 1 or above for CSA and of 0.2 or above for CA.

and brain (Table 5); the activity in kidney can be detected with the use of carboxyl-¹⁴C-labeled substrates (338) but not with conventional Warburg techniques (66, 81). No activity in rat heart is demonstrable by either method (66, 338).

Rat liver cysteinesulfinate carboxylyase. This is a soluble enzyme (79, 198, 337, 338, 625) with a fairly broad pH optimum between 6.5 and 8 (22, 65, 338). The enzyme requires one or more free SH groups for its function (198, 338) and is inhibited by iodoacetate, PCMB, and Cu++ (198) but not by oxygen or 8-OH-quinoline (22). The enzyme decarboxylates both CSA and CA, the former at a rate 6–7 times the rate of the latter (65, 198, 325, 337, 338). The apparent \( K_m \) for CSA has been reported to be \( 1.4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \), and the apparent \( K_m \) for CA \( 4 \times 10^{-4} \, \text{M} \) (338). The decarboxylation of CSA is competitively inhibited by CA and vice versa (85, 325, 338).

The activity of cysteinesulfinate carboxylyase of rat liver is influenced by several factors, some of which have been reviewed (86, 154).

1) Pyridoxine. Like other decarboxylases, CSA decarboxylase requires pyridoxal phosphate. Preparations of the enzyme from livers of normal rats appear to be saturated with pyridoxal phosphate, since addition of the cofactor in vitro has little or no effect on decarboxylase activity (65, 325, 338). Preparations of the enzyme from livers of pyridoxine-deficient rats show a rapid decrease and disappearance of measurable enzyme activity (80–82). Addition of pyridoxal phosphate in vitro does not restore enzyme activity if the pyridoxine-deficient state has lasted more than a week (65, 82, 84, 85, 165, 293, 325); however, the activity is restored to normal levels within 6 hr by administration of large doses of pyridoxine to pyridoxine-deficient rats (225, 293). The effect of pyridoxine on decarboxylase activity has been ascribed to its stabilizing influence on the enzyme (65), but a recent report suggests that pyridoxine induces *de novo* enzyme synthesis, since the effect of pyridoxine on decarboxylase activity is blocked by puromycin (293).

2) Gonadal hormones. Sloan-Stanley was the first to observe a sex difference in CA-decarboxylase activity in livers of rats, the activity being considerably higher in the male than in the female (625). This difference also exists with regard to decarboxylation of CSA (62, 67, 325, 662). The enzyme activity in the liver of female rats decreases to adult levels at the time of gonadal maturation (420). Ovariectomy causes an increase in enzyme activity toward that found in male livers (157–159, 625, 662), whereas injections of estradiol are followed by a decrease in the decarboxylase activity in livers from normal rats of both sexes (420), as well as from female rats subjected to ovariectomy (158, 160, 625), thyroidectomy (160), or both (160). Progesterone injections have no effect on decarboxylase activity (158). The effect of estradiol injections cannot be counteracted by the addition of pyridoxine in vitro to the enzyme preparation, nor does estradiol in concentrations of \( 10^{-6} \)–\( 3.2 \times 10^{-5} \, \text{M} \) decrease CSA-decarboxylase activity (420). These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that estradiol acts as a repressor of CSA-decarboxylase synthesis, but other interpretations are not excluded. Future work should clarify the mechanism of estradiol action, as well as the possible physiological significance of this regulatory system.

3) Thyroid hormone. Thyroidectomy causes an increase in the activity of CSA-

decarboxylase in livers of female rats, both normal (67) and ovariectomized (160), but does not affect the activity in livers of male rats (67). Thyroidectomy also increases the activity of other enzymes involved in the metabolism of sulfur amino acids (163). Thyroxine, injected in amounts exceeding 70 μg/100 g per day for 5 days, causes a decrease in CSA-decarboxylase activity in the liver of normal male and female rats and ovariectomized rats (159), whereas in doses of only 10 μg/100 g/day for 8–12 days, it causes a decrease in liver decarboxylase activity in thyroidectomized rats with (67) or without (160) ovaries but not in ovariectomized (160) or normal (67) female rats. The effect of thyroxine injections is not counteracted by the addition of pyridoxine to the enzyme preparation (67), nor does the addition in vitro of thyroxine in concentrations of 10⁻⁴ M decrease decarboxylase activity (67, 159). Since decarboxylase activity is higher in thyroidectomized, ovariectomized rats than in rats subjected to ovariectomy alone, and since thyroxine in smaller doses lowers the enzyme activity in thyroidectomized but not in ovariectomized rats, it appears that the two hormones exert their effects independently (160).

Several studies have attempted to define the mechanism of action of thyroxine on decarboxylase activity (161, 346, 347, 421). The levels of pyridoxine in liver are higher in thyroidectomized than in euthyroid rats and decrease after injections of thyroxine (346, 421). These observations are compatible with the hypothesis that thyroxine regulates decarboxylase activity by controlling the levels of pyridoxal phosphate. Since injections of thyroxine lower the levels of ATP in rat liver, it has been suggested that thyroxine decreases CSA-decarboxylase activity by decreasing ATP available for pyridoxal phosphate synthesis (162). Other studies have shown that liver CSA decarboxylase normally is saturated with pyridoxal phosphate, as evidenced by a lack of increase in enzyme activity when pyridoxine is added in vitro (65, 325, 338). Furthermore, conclusive evidence against the proposed explanation for the effect of thyroxine on decarboxylase activity has been furnished by Jollès-Bergeret and co-workers (347). These investigators injected rats with pyridoxine and thyroxine simultaneously and found a 25% increase in pyridoxine levels at a time when CSA-decarboxylase activity had decreased 60%.

Recently, Chatagner et al. (161) showed that the increase in CSA-decarboxylase activity after thyroidectomy can be completely prevented by puromycin. This observation suggests that thyroxine may act as a repressor of CSA-decarboxylase synthesis.

4) Glucocorticoid hormones. Adrenalectomy causes a 60% decrease in the activity of CSA decarboxylase, whereas injections of hydrocortisone increase decarboxylase activity. The decrease after adrenalectomy is not counteracted by injections of pyridoxine (420). CSA decarboxylase therefore appears to be one of the enzymes inducible by hydrocortisone. The interrelationships between CSA decarboxylase and estradiol, thyroxine, and cortisol remain to be established.

Rat brain cysteinesulfinate carboxylase. This is also a soluble enzyme (338), although earlier studies showed it to be in part particulate (198). The pH optimum has been reported to be 7.6 (338). The enzyme requires free SH groups for its function (198, 337, 338) and decarboxylates both CSA and CA, the former at a rate 5–8 times that of the latter (65, 338).

The decarboxylase of rat brain differs in several respects from that of liver. It is much less active per milligram of protein than liver decarboxylase (65, 338). The apparent \( K_m \) for CSA, using the brain enzyme, is reported to be \( 2 \times 10^{-3} \) M and the apparent \( K_m \) for CA to be \( 4 \times 10^{-3} \) M, both values being about one order of magnitude higher for the enzyme in brain than in liver (338). The decarboxylase of brain tissue, like that of liver, requires pyridoxine (65, 198, 337, 338), but it differs from the liver enzyme in not being saturated under normal conditions, since enzyme activity is enhanced by the addition of pyridoxine in vitro (65). The enzyme in brain also is more stable, since its activity does not decrease so rapidly during pyridoxine deficiency and even then is enhanced by the addition of pyridoxine in vitro (65). The difference in the activity of the enzyme in the liver between sexes is not found in the enzyme from brain (62, 157). The brain enzyme has been reported to decarboxylate glutamic acid, whereas the liver enzyme does not (198), but later studies have indicated that the enzyme in brain does not decarboxylate glutamic acid in addition to CSA and CA. It remains true, however, that glutamic acid inhibits the decarboxylation of CSA and CA by brain enzyme noncompetitively but has no effect on the decarboxylation of CSA by liver enzyme (338).

These observations permit the conclusion that CSA decarboxylases in rat liver and rat brain are different enzymes catalyzing the same reactions, i.e., are isozymes.

As stated previously, the decarboxylation of CSA and CA is catalyzed by only one tissue-specific isozyme. This view is based on several observations. 1) The ratio of CSA- to CA-decarboxylase activity is the same in liver tissue from male and female rats (85, 325) and at pH values between 6.4 and 7.8 (338). In rat brain, the ratio also remains the same through most of the range studied, although some variation was noted (65, 338). The ratio remains the same in partially purified liver and brain preparations as in homogenates (338). 2) The decarboxylase activity in liver toward CSA and CA declines *pari passu* as pyridoxine deficiency develops (85) and during thermal inactivation of the enzyme (198). 3) The decarboxylation of CSA is inhibited by CA and vice versa (85, 325). The inhibition is competitive both in liver and in brain and the \( K_m \) and \( K_i \) values for each substrate are in close agreement (338).

These observations furnish substantial, albeit indirect, evidence in favor of the existence in the rat of only one decarboxylase shared by CSA and CA. The results obtained by Sörbo and Heyman in studies of dog liver indicate the presence of two separate decarboxylases in that tissue (631). These workers purified a decarboxylase from dog liver; as purification proceeded the activity of the enzyme toward CSA increased considerably more than that toward CA. The final preparation, however, was quite unstable. Hope, in discussing this question (327), pointed out that evidence obtained by others (66, 198) indicates that the sulfinyl group of CSA, but not the sulfonyl group of CA, is able to activate partially inactivated decarboxylase preparations. The results obtained by Sörbo and Heyman (631) do not furnish conclusive evidence against the one-enzyme hypothesis, in particular since no preparation with a relative increase in CA/CSA activity ratio was obtained. The kinetic data, including the demonstration of close agreement between the \( K_m \) and \( K_i \) values for CSA and CA, strongly support the one-enzyme hypothesis, at least

for mammalian tissues (338). It seems justified to conclude tentatively that the decarboxylation of CSA and CA in rat, and probably in mammalian liver and brain, is catalyzed by one enzyme, cysteinesulfinate carboxylase.

IN THE GUINEA PIG. The only tissue studied from this species is the liver, in which decarboxylase activity toward both CSA and CA has been demonstrated (79, 85, 325).

IN THE DOG. Liver tissue from dogs shows a high decarboxylase activity toward both CSA and CA (79, 85, 325, 337, 338, 631), although in one study, CA-decarboxylase activity could not be demonstrated in liver tissue from female dogs (22). This failure was attributed to the sex of the animal since the decarboxylase in male and female dogs differs as it does in male and female rats. Higher activity in liver tissue from male than from female dogs was also noted by Sörbo and Heyman, although the activity in the liver of female dogs was measurable (631). High levels of decarboxylase activity toward both CSA and CA also have been observed in brain and kidney tissue (337, 338), although in earlier work Blaschko had failed to find CA-decarboxylase activity in dog kidney (79). Dog heart preparations are incapable of decarboxylating either CSA or CA (337, 338). The conversion of ${}^{35}$S-cysteine to taurine by dog heart slices, demonstrated by Read and Welty (552), would therefore appear to proceed along pathways other than I and II.

IN THE CAT. In earlier studies with conventional Warburg techniques, no CSA- or CA-decarboxylase activity could be demonstrated in the liver or kidney of the cat (79, 85, 325). With the use of carboxyl-${}^{14}$C-labeled CSA and CA as substrates, recent studies have demonstrated slight but definite decarboxylase activity in preparations of these tissues (338). Expressed per milligram protein, the activity in cat liver and kidney is only 10% of that in cat brain, a finding comparable to the observations on human tissues, whereas the decarboxylase activity of other mammals studied to date is much higher in liver than in brain (337, 338). The absence of significant decarboxylase activity in liver tissue from the cat indicates that pathways I and II are not available for taurine synthesis in the liver of this species and raises the question of the origin of taurine present in the liver of cats (see Table 4) and of taurocholic acid in the bile (305).

IN THE PIG, COW, HORSE. Only liver tissue from these species has been examined for decarboxylase activity. Pig liver is reported to show some activity toward CA (79), whereas the activity toward CSA in the cow and the embryonic calf is low (268, 631). Horse liver appears to be devoid of any CSA-decarboxylase activity (631). Thus, the horse resembles the cat and man in lacking the enzymic apparatus necessary for the synthesis of taurine along pathways I and II.

c. Oxidation of hypotaurine to taurine. Little is known about the biochemistry of this last step in the synthesis of taurine. Cavallini and co-workers (128) were unable to demonstrate the conversion of hypotaurine to taurine in vitro in homogenates of rat liver, kidney, and muscle, although taurine excretion rose after administration of hypotaurine. In more recent work, Sumizu described an enzyme in the soluble fraction of rat liver that catalyzes the conversion of hypotaurine to taurine, with NAD as cofactor (649). No other reports of studies on this reaction had appeared at the time of this review.

In summary, evidence derived from both in vivo and in vitro studies clearly shows that synthesis of taurine along pathways I and II occurs only in certain tissues and certain species. Firm evidence exists for the availability of these pathways in the liver of the rat, dog, rabbit, and probably also the mouse, guinea pig, pig, and cow. There is also good evidence for these pathways in the brain of the rat, rabbit, dog, cat, and man and in the kidney of the dog. In contrast, pathways I and II do not appear to contribute significantly to the synthesis or content of taurine in the liver of the cat, horse, or man, the heart of the rat, rabbit, dog, and cat, or the kidney of the rat, cat, and man, all of which contain significant amounts of taurine (Table 4). At present, no information is available on the availability of pathways I and II for the synthesis of taurine in many other tissues in which this compound is found.

Several factors point to the existence of alternative pathways of taurine formation in at least some tissues and species. These are the presence of taurine in tissues lacking the enzymic apparatus for synthesizing the compound along pathways I and II, the persistence of taurine in tissues (92, 326, 327, 510) and of taurocholic acid in bile (61, 63) under circumstances such as pyridoxine deficiency, during which pathways I and II may be assumed to be reduced in activity, and, finally, the lack of correlation between decarboxylase activity and taurine levels in the liver of male and female rats. The evidence for such alternative pathways is considered in the following sections.

### 2. Pathway III, the cystamine-taurine pathway

In 1933 Schöberl suggested that the conversion of cysteine to taurine in vivo might be by way of cystamine, which he had shown to be converted to taurine chemically (601). Experimental evidence in support of this concept gradually accumulated over the next two decades, and in the period 1954–1956 Eldjarn (234, 235) and Cavallini (116) critically reviewed the information available at that time. In brief, this information indicated that cysteamine and cystamine could serve as precursors of taurine in several mammals, including man, and that hypotaurine was an intermediate in the conversion of cysteamine/cystamine to taurine, whereas the existence of cystamine disulfoxide, the intermediate proposed by Medes and Floyd (481), was questionable (for a detailed discussion see refs. 116 and 235). Cysteamine was thought to derive from coenzyme A, of which it had been shown to be a part. The question of the occurrence of free cysteamine and cystamine in tissues was unsettled, and knowledge concerning the nature of the biochemical reactions linking cystine with cysteamine and cystamine and linking these compounds with hypotaurine and taurine was meager.

In the past decade, knowledge concerning the existence and biochemical reactions involved in pathway III has grown considerably, due almost exclusively to extensive work by Cavallini and collaborators (119–121, 125–127, 131, 132, 137–140, 203–208, 224, 235, 493, 494, 593–595). Nevertheless, it is not yet possible to estimate to what extent the synthesis of taurine in various mammalian tissues

proceeds along pathways I and III. The physiological significance of pathway III therefore remains to be established.

In 1952 Cavallini found that the urine of rats fed L-cystine contained a hitherto unknown sulfur compound, which could be converted to taurine by treatment with H₂O₂ and liberated iodine from potassium iodide in acid solution (133). A ninhydrin-positive sulfur compound with similar chemical characteristics was subsequently discovered by Awapara in kidney extracts from rats given ³⁵S-cysteine (39). Several years later, this compound was identified as thiotaurine, NH₂CH₂-CH₂SO₂SH, and was again observed in kidney tissue and urine of rats given labeled and unlabeled cystine as well as ³⁵S-cystamine (124, 130, 494).

As a result of in vitro work, it is now reasonably well established that thiotaurine is formed as a by-product in the conversion of cystamine to hypotaurine. The detection of thiotaurine after administration of cysteine, cystine, or cystamine constitutes indirect evidence for the existence in rats of pathway III, whereby cystine is converted to taurine via cystamine.

The conversion of cystamine to taurine has been studied primarily with extracts of pig and horse kidney, although other tissues have been examined for activity of at least one enzyme involved in the reaction sequence (127, 224). Four reactions are currently known to be involved in the conversion of cystamine to hypotaurine (see Fig. 1):

1) Oxidative deamination of cystamine to cystaldimine (1,2-dehydroidithiomorpholine). This reaction is catalyzed by diamine:O₂-oxidoreductase (deaminating, E.C. 1.4.3.6) (119–121, 204, 493); cellular monoamine oxidase does not play a role in this reaction (205).

2) Degradation of cystaldimine to thiocysteamine, NH₂CH₂CH₂SSH, and a C₂ fragment, presumed to be glycolaldehyde (204). An enzyme catalyzing this reaction has been partially purified from hog kidney (493), and thiocysteamine has been identified as a cleavage product of cystaldimine by iodoacetate trapping (203).

3) Spontaneous breakdown of thiocysteamine to cysteamine and sulfur.

4) Oxidation of cysteamine to hypotaurine, part of which is spontaneously transsulfurated to thiotaurine (125, 126, 131, 394). The enzyme responsible for this reaction is a persulfurase [or perhaps an oxygenase (594)], present in greatest amounts in extracts of horse kidney (127, 224) and partially purified from this source (132, 206, 207). The enzyme has a molecular weight of 83,000 and contains one atom of nonheme iron per molecule (132). Studies of cofactor requirements have shown that colloidal sulfur, sulfide, thioacetic acid, thiotaurine, and other sulfur compounds yielding the two first mentioned may serve as cofactors (138, 139, 595). Methylene blue also serves as cofactor, but apparently not because of its properties as a hydrogen carrier (139, 594). Finally, colloidal selenium can serve as cofactor for the persulfurase (140). All these cofactor-like compounds share the properties of inhibiting the enzyme at high concentrations and of catalyzing the conversion of cysteamine to cystamine in the absence of the enzyme (139), although differences between them are demonstrable at different oxygen concentrations (593).

Pig and horse kidney are the best sources of diamine oxidase and of persulfurase, respectively. Persulfurase, however, is widely distributed and has been demonstrated in extracts of kidney, liver, muscle, and heart of the ox, horse, pig, and rabbit, in the liver, kidney, and heart of the rat, and in the liver and kidney of sheep (127, 224). This pattern of distribution is of considerable interest when compared with the pattern of distribution of CSA decarboxylase (see Table 5). Persulfurase is found in many tissues, such as those of the rabbit and the kidney and heart of the rat, in which CSA-decarboxylase activity is low or absent. The demonstration of persulfurase activity suggests that taurine synthesis in these tissues proceeds along pathway III. In addition, the demonstration in rat liver of persulfurase activity (127, 208, 224), together with CSA-decarboxylase activity, suggests that taurine synthesis in this tissue may occur along both pathway I and III. If so, it would provide an explanation for the persistence of normal taurine levels in rat liver and of taurocholic acid in bile during pyridoxine deficiency (61, 63, 92, 510), which would cause a decrease in the activity of pathway I but not of pathway III.

The presence of persulfurase in heart tissue is worthy of note. Taurine content is higher in mammalian heart than in most other tissues (see Table 4), and cystine is converted to taurine by dog heart slices (552). Yet CSA-decarboxylase activity is notably absent from heart tissue of the mammals so far examined (see Table 5). Pathway III may therefore be of particular significance in the synthesis of taurine in heart tissue.

Data on the distribution of the enzymes of pathway III are still incomplete. Information about the availability of this pathway in mammalian brain is important, since brain taurine levels appear to be unaffected by pyridoxine deficiency (326, 327). The possible role of pathway III in human tissues is of particular importance because no significant CSA-decarboxylase activity is found apart from brain. Cystamine has been shown to be a precursor of taurine in man (234, 235), but studies of human tissues in vitro have not yet been reported.

In summary, in vitro studies have shown the existence of pathway III in several mammalian tissues and species. Some of these also have the capacity to synthesize taurine along pathways I and II, whereas others may rely exclusively on pathway III. Nothing is known at present about the quantitative relationships between these pathways. Information on the biochemical reactions whereby cysteine and cystine are converted to cystamine continues to be limited.

## 3. Pathway IV

The incorporation of inorganic sulfate or sulfite into taurine or taurine precursors apparently is not a quantitatively significant means of taurine synthesis in mammals. The subject was reviewed in 1956 by Pearson (528) and by Fromageot and Chapeville (267), who concluded that evidence in support of significant nonbacterial incorporation of sulfate into organic sulfur compounds in mammals was meager. The first evidence pointing to the existence of pathway IV in mammals was reported by Boström and Åquist (95), who observed the incorporation of small

amounts of radioactive sulfate into taurine isolated from the liver of rats injected with ${}^{35}\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$. In these studies, no incorporation into cystine or methionine was demonstrable. Dziewiatkowski (228), however, found a small amount of radioactivity in cystine isolated from various tissues of rats injected with ${}^{35}\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$, which he ascribed to the formation of cystine by bacteria in the gut. Later, Green and Robinson noted the presence of radioactive CA and taurine in extracts of brain from rats injected with ${}^{35}\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ but were unable to demonstrate conversion of radioactive sulfate or pyruvate to CA and taurine in rat brain in vitro (292). In a recent abstract, Huovinen and Gustafsson stated that germfree rats are incapable of fixing inorganic sulfur at the sulfite or sulfate level but that sulfide may become incorporated into cysteine both in vivo and in vitro (330). Although details of this work are still unavailable, the conclusion reached appears to eliminate pathway IV as a significant means of taurine synthesis in organs of the rat. The position is less clear cut with regard to other mammals, although it seems likely that the small amount of radioactivity appearing in organic sulfur compounds in baby pigs (416) and rabbits (415) given ${}^{35}\mathrm{SO}_{4}^{2-}$ by stomach tube can be ascribed to the action of gut bacteria. The possibility that the rabbit and the embryonic calf may be capable of fixing inorganic sulfur at the sulfite level cannot be excluded, however, since ${}^{35}\mathrm{SO}_{3}^{2-}$ is converted to CSA and hypotaurine by tissues from these animals (145, 153, 267, 268).

The last decade has seen little new work on the availability of pathway IV in mammals that would challenge the conclusion reached in 1956 that nonbacterial conversion of sulfate to taurine and other sulfur compounds in mammals is insignificant (528).

### 4. Pathway V

Evidence for the existence of this pathway, through which cystine is assumed to be converted to hypotaurine via cystine disulfoxide and cystamine disulfoxide, is lacking, although the pathway was proposed almost 30 years ago by Medes and Floyd (481). This proposal was based on earlier observations by Medes (479) on the increase in taurocholic acid excretion found by Virtue and Doster-Virtue in dogs given cystine disulfoxide (692) and on their own studies that indicated the presence in rat liver of an enzyme system capable of decarboxylating and oxidizing cystine (481). Medes and Floyd also showed that cystamine disulfoxide was readily oxidized. Unfortunately they did not study the oxidation of cystine disulfoxide, a toxic compound, rather insoluble, which shows a rapid rate of dismutation to CSA and cystine at alkaline pH values (116, 424), factors that apparently hindered further biochemical studies of this compound. Interest in the existence of pathway V was revived for a time after Cavallini and collaborators provisionally identified cystamine disulfoxide in the urine and liver of rats fed cystine (115, 134, 135), but further studies (reviewed in ref. 116) showed that the compound actually was hypotaurine. Since no further studies on the biochemistry of these compounds appear to have been done, the existence of pathway V in mammalian tissues remains conjectural.

In summary, taurine synthesis in biological systems can follow several different pathways, of which the CSA-hypotaurine sequence (pathway I) is the most common in animals. In certain species, notably birds, the immediate precursor of taurine appears to be CA, and in these species the incorporation of sulfate into taurine appears to be of considerable importance. Recent evidence suggests that an alternative pathway, in which cysteamine and cystamine are intermediates, may exist in many mammalian tissues as a source of taurine synthesis. The quantitative importance of cysteamine as a taurine precursor remains to be established. Taurine may be synthesized within a cell by one of the mechanisms reviewed above. It may also occur intracellularly as the result of transport across the cell membrane. This aspect is considered next.

V. MOVEMENT OF TAURINE ACROSS CELL MEMBRANES

The transfer of taurine across cell membranes has been the subject of a number of investigations, which may be divided into two categories: $a$) taurine transport across cell membranes in vitro and $b$) the uptake of injected ${}^{35}$S-taurine by various tissues in vivo.

A. In Vitro Studies

From the data presented in Tables 3 and 4, it is apparent that the concentration of taurine in tissues often exceeds that of the surrounding extracellular fluid by several orders of magnitude. A high taurine content is not only characteristic of many normal tissues, but also of tumor tissue (376, 557, 563) and of tumor cells grown in tissue culture (290, 540, 562). For example, the concentration of taurine in the cell water of growing HeLa cells is 14.3 mm or 7000 times greater than the concentration in the surrounding medium (540). Since there is no evidence that intracellular taurine is sequestered, it is assumed that the maintenance of such high taurine concentration gradients indicates the existence of mechanisms for the active transport of taurine against considerable chemical gradients. These mechanisms have been investigated by several groups of workers (172–174, 310, 406, 407, 526). Christensen et al. (173) incubated ascites tumor cells in a medium containing 10 and 30 mm taurine and observed an increase in the taurine concentration of the cells, the ratio of intracellular to external taurine reaching a value of 4.8 in incubations with 10 mm taurine. In addition, they observed a decrease in the ratio to 3.4 when the medium also contained 10 mm $\beta$-alanine. This finding suggested that taurine and $\beta$-alanine compete for a common transport system. Paine and Heinz subsequently showed that the uptake by Ehrlich tumor cells of $\beta$-alanine during the first minute of incubation was not inhibited by taurine, whereas glycine and $\beta$-alanine inhibited the uptake of each other (526). Another study showed that taurine did not inhibit the uptake of glycine by Ehrlich carcinoma cells (310). Subsequently, the conflict between these data was resolved by the studies of Christensen (172) and Kromphardt (406). From a detailed kinetic analysis of the

uptake of various amino acids and taurine, these workers concluded that β-alanine uptake by cells is mediated by two transport systems: a system mediating the transport of neutral amino acids, termed the A site, and a system specifically mediating the transport of β-amino compounds, i.e., taurine, β-alanine, β-AIB and α,β-diaminopropionic acid, termed the β site (172). Although the affinity of β-alanine for the A site is low (Ka of the order of 2.2 × 10⁻² M (406)), the transport capacity at the A site is large, hence most of the β-alanine entering the cell does so at the A site. The affinity of β-alanine for the β site is about 60 times higher than for the A site [Ka of the order of 4.3 × 10⁻⁴ M (406)]; nevertheless, the transport capacity at the β site is small. Taurine has a higher affinity for the β site than β-alanine, the Ka for taurine having been calculated as 1.5 × 10⁻⁴ M (406), but taurine is not transported at the A site, being excluded by its sulfonyl group (172).

The existence of two sites mediating the uptake of β-alanine appears to account for the observations cited above (173, 310, 526). β-Alanine accordingly inhibits the uptake of taurine by competing for the β site, whereas taurine, being excluded from the A site where the uptake of alanine, glycine, and most of the β-alanine occurs, has no effect on the transfer of any of these but inhibits the uptake of β-alanine only at the β site (406).

In further studies, Kromphardt (406, 407) showed that the uptake of taurine by Ehrlich ascites tumor cells was inhibited by 2,4-dinitrophenol and anoxia (406). Lowering the pH also decreased the uptake to a residual and pH-independent rate, which appeared to be proportional to the extracellular taurine concentration. The uptake under these conditions appeared to be nonsaturable and possibly due to simple diffusion (407). Christensen and Liang (174) recently examined the “non-saturable” uptake of taurine by Ehrlich cells. Evidence was obtained that suggested the presence, in addition to the system at the β site, of another very slow, saturable system mediating the uptake of taurine. The migration of taurine showed some temperature sensitivity, but the value for Q₁₀ was lower than that for other amino acids, which suggested that a considerable part of the migration of taurine actually occurred by diffusion.

In summary, in vitro studies indicate that taurine enters cells in a complex fashion, in part by active transport at a specific site for β-amino acids, in part by active transport at another less well-defined site, and in part by simple diffusion.

### B. In Vivo Studies

The specific transport system for β-amino acids, including taurine, appears to occur in the mammalian kidney tubule, as evidenced by in vivo studies in mice, rats, and man. In mice, Gilbert and co-workers (279) demonstrated an increase in urinary taurine excretion after the intraperitoneal administration of β-alanine, β-AIB and β-amino-n-butyric acid. Similar observations have been made in rats by Bigwood (76), although Kostos and Kocsis (398) did not observe any increase in taurine excretion in rats given β-alanine and β-AIB. Scriver et al. (614) recently described a patient with an inborn error of metabolism characterized by hyper-β-alaninemina, hyper-β-alaninuria, somnolence, and seizures, in whom urinary excre-

tion of taurine and β-AIB was inappropriately high for the plasma levels of these amino acids. This was interpreted to indicate competitive inhibition in the renal tubules of the reabsorption of taurine and β-AIB by the excessive amounts of β-alanine excreted.

The distribution of injected taurine in different organs has been determined in several species. In young chickens injected with ³⁵S-taurine 1 day previously, the organs containing the greatest amounts of radioactivity are the heart, duodenum, spleen, gizzard muscle, and stomach, 16% having appeared in the excreta (446, 449). ³⁵S-taurine injected intravenously into rats and rabbits is rapidly taken up in the kidney, spleen, liver, and bone marrow, whereas uptake in heart and muscle is considerably slower (44, 46, 294, 683). Seven days later, however, the content of ³⁵S-taurine in rat heart is still considerable, indicating long retention of taurine in this organ (44). Boquet and Fromageot (92) recently studied the specific activity of taurine in various tissues of the rat after injection of tracer amounts of ³⁵S-taurine. Isotopic equilibrium was reached between plasma and liver and kidney in the course of 30 min, whereas it took 5 days before isotopic equilibrium was established between plasma and muscle and heart. The rate of turnover of taurine in different tissues differed markedly, from very fast in such tissues as the liver and the kidney to very slow in the heart and muscle. The half-life of taurine in the whole body of the rat was calculated as 12–13 days, corresponding to a daily renewal of 5.7% or approximately 35 μmoles of taurine/100 g body weight.

The fate of injected taurine is affected by the nutritional state of the animal. Rats maintained on diets deficient in protein or in sulfur amino acids retain significantly more of a tracer dose of ³⁵S-taurine than do rats on a normal diet (544, 545, 576). The taurine retained is found primarily in the musculoskeletal system and in viscera other than the liver and kidneys (544). After injection of ³⁵S-taurine, the specific activity of taurine isolated from organs, such as the liver and kidney, of rats receiving protein-deficient diets is higher than that from rats on normal diets (565, 576). This difference probably reflects both increased retention of ³⁵S-taurine (544, 545) and depletion of tissue taurine in the undernourished rats (576), although the effect of fasting on tissue taurine levels is quite variable (see section III, B).

In summary, taurine gains rapid entrance to some but not all cells by a combination of active transport and diffusion. It appears to be retained for differing lengths of time in different tissues before being replaced. The concentration of taurine in a tissue can be viewed as an equilibrium, in which taurine newly synthesized along one or several pathways or transferred from the exterior replaces taurine leaving the cells or being metabolized to other compounds.

VI. METABOLISM OF TAURINE

Taurine has long been known to be conjugated with bile acids in the liver but otherwise has generally been considered a metabolic end product. This view is almost certainly erroneous. Although evidence on the conversion of taurine to

other sulfur compounds is incomplete, information is available concerning its conversion to at least five other compounds in biological systems (see Fig. 1).

### A. Conversion to Inorganic Sulfate

Inorganic sulfate has been shown to be formed by several strains of bacteria grown on media in which taurine was the sole source of sulfur. Evidence for ISA as an intermediate in this conversion was obtained in one study (98), although no formation of inorganic sulfate from ISA was demonstrable in another (334). Bacteria also appear to be responsible for the formation of inorganic sulfate from taurine in *Blatella*, since this conversion occurs in the xenic variety but not in theaposymbiotic variety of the roach (88, 315).

In the chicken embryo, taurine does not give rise to inorganic sulfate (147, 148). Studies in mammals have given equivocal results. Salkowski reported an increase in the urinary excretion of inorganic sulfate in rabbits fed taurine (587, 590), an observation confirmed many years later (709). The increased excretion was attributed to microbial activity in the gut of the rabbit, since sulfate excretion remained the same in rabbits given taurine parenterally (590, 703). A similar conclusion was reached in studies with rats. In this species, significant amounts of ${}^{35}$S-taurine have been shown to be converted to inorganic sulfate (76, 576, 604, 606–608); in one study as much as 80% of the administered radioactivity was recovered as inorganic sulfate (92). The conversion of taurine to inorganic sulfate is significantly reduced when rats are treated with antibiotics (92, 608). Subcutaneous injection of either taurine or ISA does not increase sulfate excretion in rats (471). Finally, homogenates of rat brain, liver, and other tissues do not liberate inorganic sulfate when incubated with taurine (334). The possibility that intestinal cells are capable of converting taurine to inorganic sulfate (92) has not been studied directly. It is probable, however, that conversion of taurine to inorganic sulfate does occur in higher animals and may account for the elimination of a major part of taurine from the body. Current evidence suggests that the conversion is due entirely to the action of bacteria in the gut on taurine and taurocholic acid.

### B. Conversion to Carbamyltaurine

Salkowski claimed to have isolated carbamyltaurine from the urine of dogs and man fed taurine (558, 590), but others were unable to confirm this finding (596–599). Philosophow (539) presented indirect evidence for the formation of carbamyltaurine in the liver of dogs, but his results were not confirmed by Lippich (439). In more recent studies special chromatographic methods have been developed to allow more precise measurement of carbamyltaurine (607, 609, 667, 674). These studies indicate that carbamyltaurine may be excreted by rats and man in amounts of 5–10 $\mu$g/100 ml urine, but the small amounts excreted do not increase after the administration of taurine (609). At present, insufficient evidence is available to conclude whether carbamyltaurine is a natural metabolite of taurine or an artifact.

C. Formation of Taurocyamine and Phosphataurocyamine

As shown in Table 2, taurocyamine occurs in a number of species from invertebrate phyla, in particular sedentary polychaetes (1, 4, 50, 240, 322, 323, 565, 571, 670, 671, 675, 676, 678) and sipunculoids (50, 570, 670, 675, 678). It has also been identified in a few species from the phyla Porifera (11, 566, 569) and Cnidaria (453, 566). In vertebrates, taurocyamine has been identified in extracts of rat brain (87) and in the urine of rats and man (609, 667, 674).

Phosphataurocyamine is one of the many phosphagens found in invertebrates (reviewed in refs. 240, 671, 673). Phosphataurocyamine appears to have a more limited distribution than taurocyamine, having been identified only in sedentary polychaetes (240, 322, 323, 671, 673, 675, 676) and the sipuncolid *Phascolosoma* (675). Phosphataurocyamine is not found in certain sponges that contain taurocyamine (569).

The biosynthesis of taurocyamine appears to involve the transfer of a guanido group to either taurine or hypotaurine. Abbott and Awapara demonstrated the formation of taurocyamine from ${}^{35}$S-taurine in in vivo experiments with *Arenicola*, but were unable to do so in vitro (1, 45). In contrast, transamidination between arginine and hypotaurine, yielding hypotaurocyamine, which is subsequently oxidized chemically to taurocyamine, has been demonstrated both in *Arenicola* and in *Phascolosoma* (678). The site of the transamidination reaction appears to be the intestinal tract in both species. The subsequent oxidation to taurocyamine in *Arenicola* takes place in muscle, whereas in *Phascolosoma* some taurocyamine is formed in the intestinal tract. In both species the compound or compounds formed in the intestinal tract are subsequently transferred to muscle. These differences account for the observation that *Arenicola* muscle contains 10 times as much taurocyamine as hypotaurocyamine, whereas the reverse is found in *Phascolosoma* muscle (567, 570, 678). The inability of *Phascolosoma* muscle to oxidize hypotaurocyamine to taurocyamine has been attributed to the low oxygen tension in the tissues of this species consequent to life at greater depths than *Arenicola* (567, 678).

The conversion of hypotaurocyamine and taurocyamine to the corresponding phosphagens is catalyzed by two different enzymes: ATP-hypotaurocyamine-phosphotransferase (E.C. 2.7.3.6) and ATP-taurocyamine-phosphotransferase (E.C. 2.7.3.4). The former is present in preparations of *Phascolosoma* muscle and has a molecular weight of 83,000 (666, 672). Although hypotaurocyamine is the preferred substrate (the $K_s$ having been calculated to be $4.5 \times 10^{-3}$ M), the enzyme also accepts taurocyamine ($K_s = 1.9 \times 10^{-2}$ M), although less readily (672). The latter enzyme and the reaction it catalyzes have been studied in particular by Thoai and collaborators (358, 665, 666, 668, 669, 673), although annelid phosphokinases were studied earlier by Hobson and Rees (323) and by Ennor and Morrison (240). Taurocyamine phosphotransferase has been partially purified from *Arenicola* muscle (358, 668, 673), has a molecular weight of 80–87,000 (358, 666) and contains 12 free SH groups, one of which is located at the active site (666, 668). The pH optimum of the reaction in the direction of phosphagen formation is 8.9, and in the opposite direction, 7.1 (665, 668). At the latter value, the free energy of hydrolysis is about 7 kcal/mole, or somewhat less than the cor-

responding value for phosphocreatine and phosphoarginine (673). The lower thermodynamic potential of phosphataurocyamine may be advantageous to contraction of slower muscles such as those of polychaetes (673). The enzyme in Arenicola muscle acts preferentially on taurocyamine \((K_s = 3.85 \times 10^{-3} \, \text{M})\). The enzyme also accepts hypotaurocyamine \((K_s = 2.4 \times 10^{-2} \, \text{M})\), although less readily (672).

Aside from serving as a precursor of phosphataurocyamine in a few species, the metabolic fate of taurocyamine in invertebrates is unknown. In dogs only \(8\%\) of a large dose of taurocyamine could be recovered as such in the urine, suggesting conversion to other compounds (3). Further work is necessary to confirm the presence of taurocyamine in mammalian tissues and urine (87, 609, 667, 674). A role for this compound in mammalian physiology and biochemistry remains to be defined.

### D. Conversion to Isethionic Acid (ISA)

Koechlin was the first to demonstrate ISA in biological material. In analyses of the constituents of the axoplasm of giant squids, ISA was the dominant anion (390–392). These observations were subsequently confirmed and extended by Deffner and Hafter, who noted that ISA was found in squids and molluscs generally, but was lacking or present in low concentration in crustacean and vertebrate nerve (199, 201, 202).

Recent evidence suggests that ISA may be present more widely in biological systems. Braun and Fromageot (98) demonstrated the formation of ISA from taurine in cultures of *Aspergillus niger*, and Cotty et al. (181) found evidence suggesting the formation of ISA in *Musca domestica*. Several studies of the metabolism of cystine, inorganic sulfate, and taurine in the chicken embryo noted the formation from these compounds of very acid ninhydrin-negative sulfur compounds, one of which could be ISA (147–149, 443, 446, 449, 465). ISA was not formed in in vitro studies of embryonic calf's liver (268). Schram first suggested that rat urine contains ISA (604), and ISA may have been one of the several unidentified sulfur compounds observed by Cavallini and co-workers in the urine of rats given \({}^{35}\)S-cystine (130). The first unequivocal demonstration of ISA in mammals is that of Welty et al. (707), who in 1962 reported the isolation and identification of ISA from dog heart. They also demonstrated the conversion of cysteine and taurine to ISA in dog heart slices (552). More recently, the formation of ISA from taurine has been described in homogenates of rat brain (529). So far, only two studies have examined the question of ISA in man (284, 336). Goodman et al. (284) recently reported the presence of \({}^{35}\)S-ISA in the urine of some normal subjects and mongoloids given \({}^{35}\)S-taurine, and Jacobsen et al. (336), using a sensitive and specific double-isotope derivative method, reported the first quantitative data on the urinary excretion of ISA in man. The average excretion was \(13.7 \, \text{mg/24 hr}\) (sd \(4.2 \, \text{mg}\)) in 10 patients hospitalized for various nonmuscular diseases, whereas in 8 other patients with muscular diseases accompanied by muscle atrophy it was \(7 \, \text{mg/24 hr}\) (sd \(2.7 \, \text{mg}\)), the difference being highly significant. This report is of interest for three reasons:

1) it establishes the occurrence of ISA in man; 2) it indicates that the amounts normally excreted are quite significant, being approximately 10% of the values for taurine, the presumed precursor; and 3) it suggests that striated muscle may be the main source of urinary ISA.

Few data are available on the metabolic fate of ISA. Salkowski found that the urinary excretion of inorganic sulfate rose in dogs given ISA, whereas in rabbits this treatment caused a rise in the excretion of thiosulfate (591). In contrast, Heffter reported that thiosulfate but not sulfate excretion rose in dogs receiving ISA (309). In rats Maw found no evidence of conversion of ISA to either inorganic sulfate or thiosulfate (471). Braun and Fromageot suggested that ISA was an intermediate between taurine and inorganic sulfate in *Aspergillus niger* (98). In another microorganism, a species of *Agrobacterium*, Ikeda et al. (334) could not demonstrate formation of sulfate from ISA. Deffner and Hafter identified a unique compound in the axoplasm of the giant squid, cysteic acid amide, and suggested that it might have been formed from ISA and urea after the splitting off of water (201). The possibility, discussed in section VIII, E, that ISA plays a physiologic role in the distribution of ions across the membranes of excitable tissues will undoubtedly stimulate research into these poorly defined metabolic pathways in the future.

### E. Conjugation with Bile Acids

A number of reviews in recent years have summarized current knowledge regarding the structure, formation, metabolism, distribution, and possible biological significance of bile salts (69, 195, 303–306, 335). Only a few pertinent topics are considered here. Conjugation of bile acids with taurine is a trait that appears early in evolution somewhere between the selachians and the true fishes. In contrast, conjugation with glycine is a relatively recent phylogenetic development most characteristic of herbivorous mammals (305). The ratio between glycine- and taurine-conjugated bile acids (G/T ratio) shows considerable variation from one mammalian species to another. This variation is in part the result of species-specific differences in the activities of the enzymes catalyzing the conjugation of bile acids with glycine and taurine. Rat liver microsomes catalyze the conjugation of free bile acids with both glycine and taurine, but preferentially with the latter. Rabbit liver microsomes conjugate almost exclusively with glycine (101). Preparations of human liver are capable of conjugating cholic acid with both glycine and taurine. Without additions, 40–60% of the total amount of conjugates formed is coupled with taurine, but this increases to 90% on addition of excess taurine. Addition of glycine has little influence on the G/T ratio (70, 232). The G/T ratio, besides being dependent on the enzyme activities characteristic of a given species, appears to vary with the amount of taurine available for conjugation. This view is supported by a number of observations. The G/T ratio increases in the bile of rats made pyridoxine deficient, presumably reflecting decreased synthesis of taurine (61, 63, 218). In a strain of rats that normally conjugate bile acids with glycine and taurine with a G/T ratio of 0.3, partial hepatectomy was followed immediately by a decrease in overall conjugation. On the 2nd postoperative day,

conjugation with glycine was restored to normal. Conjugation with taurine remained subnormal for several months (55), but could be restored to normal by feeding the rats taurine (56). This decrease in taurine available for conjugation after partial hepatectomy is also reflected by a decline in hepatic taurine content under these conditions (244, 561). Adrenalectomy results in an increase in the G/T ratio to about 1, whereas the normal ratio in rats is about 0.1 (312). It is tempting to attribute this change to decreased availability of taurine secondary to decreased activity of CSA-decarboxylase after adrenalectomy (164). No decrease in taurine content of livers from adrenalectomized male rats has been found, however (40).

In dogs the administration of taurine (68, 251, 703) or taurine precursors (68, 252, 691–694) together with cholic acid has long been known to increase the excretion of taurocholic acid in the bile. Recent studies indicate that the amount of taurine available for conjugation in this species is 673 ± 146 μmoles/kg body weight (522). Since the taurine content of canine liver is about 7 μmoles/g wet weight tissue (337, 338), the value just cited must include taurine synthesized during the determination of the pool size or taurine transferred to the liver during the experiment. In man the G/T ratio varies widely on a free diet (622, 624) and may be lowered to about 0.1 by the addition of taurine to the food (623, 684). Addition of glycine has little or no effect (623). The capacity of human liver to conjugate bile acids with taurine is apparently less vulnerable than the capacity for conjugation with glycine. Studies of the conjugating pattern in liver tissue or bile from patients with obstructive jaundice of more than a week’s duration (231, 232, 624), portal cirrhosis (624), or acute hepatitis (231, 624) or from patients having undergone lengthy operations (232) all show a decrease in the G/T ratio, denoting a relative although not necessarily absolute increase in taurocholate formation. The low G/T ratio found in patients with obstructive jaundice returns to normal after surgical removal of the obstruction (233). In contrast high G/T ratios, often exceeding 10, are characteristic of bile from patients with myxedema. The G/T ratio is restored to normal either by administration of taurine or thyroxine, but only the latter lowers the serum cholesterol levels of myxedematous patients (311, 624).

In summary, the formation of taurocholate occurs widely in vertebrates, is variable in different mammalian species, and may be dependent to a considerable degree on the amount of taurine synthesized endogenously or supplied in the food. The possible role of taurine after conjugation with bile acids is discussed in section VIII, D.

### F. Conversion to Miscellaneous Derivatives

It seems reasonable to assume that taurine is the precursor of several of the compounds listed in Tables 1 and 2. These include mono- and dimethyltaurine, found in red algae (436) and in the sponge *Calyx nicagensis* (11), trimethyltaurine or taurobetaine, found in another sponge (9, 10) and in the cnidarian *Briareum* (176), and *N*(D - 2,3 - dihydroxy - *n* - propyl) - taurine and *N*(1 - carboxy - ethyl) - tau-

rine, found in certain red algae (710). Nothing is known of the mechanisms whereby these compounds are formed, or of their function. Like taurine, taurocyamine may be methylated. Asterubin is the dimethyl derivative of taurocyamine, which has been identified once in nature in *Asterias rubens* (2), but the mechanism of its formation and its function are not known.

VII. TAURINE IN MAN

The concentrations of taurine in human tissues have been discussed in section III, B, and the available data are included in Table 4. This section is concerned with the concentrations of taurine in human body fluids, in particular blood and urine, the factors affecting the concentrations, and the disorders associated with abnormalities in the concentration of taurine in body fluids.

Numerous reports have dealt with the concentration of amino acids, including taurine, in human body fluids (as reviewed in refs. 77, 339, 612, 634, 708). Methods for the determination of amino acids have become increasingly refined and sensitive, since the development by Dent (209) and by Moore and Stein (495, 496), respectively, of paper and ion-exchange chromatographic procedures applicable to analyses of human body fluids. In particular, the Moore and Stein ion-exchange chromatographic technique, as modified by Spackman et al. (635), Hamilton (299, 300), and others (215, 374), now permits separation and quantitation of a large number of the amino acids present in body fluids.

### A. In Human Body Fluids

#### 1. Bile

In one study (175) the average concentration of taurine in bile from 5 normal subjects was 200 μmoles/liter; in bile from patients with inflammatory diseases of the bile ducts it was normal, and in bile from 14 patients with acute or chronic hepatitis it was reduced to 60–75 μmoles.

#### 2. Milk

The concentration of taurine in milk from 3 lactating women averaged 337 μmoles/liter, in contrast to an average plasma concentration of 200 μmoles/liter (29), suggesting active transport of taurine into the milk ducts. The concentration of taurine appears to be higher in human milk than in cow's milk.

#### 3. Saliva

Taurine has been identified qualitatively in saliva (578). One report gives the concentration as about 70 μmoles/liter (53), whereas another report gives the

average concentration in saliva from 5 normal subjects as 40 μmoles/liter, with a range of 16–65 μmoles/liter (713).

### 4. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)

The first qualitative identification of taurine in human CSF was reported by Knauff (379, 384). Quantitative measurements by means of ion-exchange chromatography indicate that the concentration of taurine is 5–10 μmoles/liter, or 20% or less of the concentration in serum (386, 536). Using a paper chromatographic method followed by spectrophotometry, Mütting and Shivaram found the concentration of taurine to be somewhat higher, ranging between 16 and 36 μmoles /liter (504). The taurine concentration in CSF from 18 mental defectives, including 2 patients with mongolism, showed no significant deviation from the normal range (536).

### 5. Sweat

Taurine and a number of other amino acids are found in minute concentrations in human sweat. Their presence may give rise to contamination in microanalyses (301, 524).

### 6. Plasma or serum

The concentration of taurine in plasma or serum from normal adults and from children after the first few weeks of life has been reported to range from 25 to 150 μmoles/liter as determined by paper chromatography followed by quantitation (381) or ion-exchange chromatography (12, 90, 105, 169, 171, 194, 215, 242, 277, 280, 298, 333, 383, 385, 511, 513, 610, 612–614, 633, 634, 641, 702, 726–728). A few studies report higher values for the upper limits of normal (257, 718); 277 μmoles/liter was reported as the upper limit in one study (262). These high values, as well as the considerable range of the normal taurine concentration, have led to the suspicion that many determinations of plasma taurine are spuriously high because of lysis of taurine-rich leukocytes and platelets, as suggested by several investigators (257, 634) and supported by results obtained by McMenamy and collaborators (476–478). Using a method in which plasma is separated from formed elements of the blood by rapid dialysis before being subjected to paper chromatography, these workers found taurine to be completely absent from plasma or present in concentrations not exceeding 20 μmoles/liter. Further support was derived from work done by Rouser and collaborators (582–584). Using paper chromatography, they observed low or absent plasma taurine in patients with granulocytic leukemia; the leukocytes and platelets of these patients contained less than normal amounts of taurine (583). In addition, they found a parallel fall in plasma and leukocyte taurine levels in a patient with lymphatic leukemia treated with chlorambucil (584) and in patients with granulocytic leukemia treated with busulfan (582). At

present, the normal range of taurine in plasma or serum given above (25–150 μmoles/liter) must be accepted with some reservation. The true concentration is likely to be closer to the lower than the upper limit of this range.

Within the limits imposed by these considerations, the levels of taurine in serum or plasma do not appear to be influenced by sex (12), phase of the menstrual cycle (633), pregnancy (171) (however, see ref. 728), or treatment with cortisol (726), estrogens (727), or progesterone (728). The amount of protein ingested also has no effect on plasma taurine levels (257, 581), although concentrations of 8 μmoles/liter or less have been reported in a few children with kwashiorkor (221). Taurine levels are substantially the same at all ages (12, 702), except during the first few weeks of life, when they often exceed 200 μmoles/liter (31, 215, 221, 276, 277, 280, 715). The concentration of taurine in cord blood from immature and premature babies is usually higher than that in blood from full-term infants (276). The elevated plasma levels just after birth decrease to normal levels during the first 1–2 weeks of life (215, 277). Comparison of the levels of amino acids, including taurine, in the plasma of mothers and newborn infants shows that the levels are 2–3 times higher in the infants than in the mothers, interpreted as suggesting active transport of amino acids and taurine across the placenta (276, 280). The persistence of hypertaurinemia for some weeks after birth has been attributed to immaturity of taurine-degrading pathways (611, 715). One such pathway is degradation of taurine to inorganic sulfate by bacteria in the gut (cf. studies in the rat, ref. 92), a reaction dependent on the development over some weeks of suitable intestinal microbial flora.

The range of reported normal plasma taurine makes it difficult to define hyper-taurinemia. Taurine levels above the upper limit of normal for the reporting laboratory have been found in some patients with hepatic coma (719), but in another study normal plasma taurine levels were found in patients with liver failure (333). Transient elevations in plasma taurine have been recorded in a patient with Hodgkin’s disease during X-ray therapy (634). As discussed subsequently, both liver disease and irradiation may be accompanied by hypertaurinuria, which in these cases apparently is of the overflow type. Except in neonates and these isolated cases, hypertaurinemia has not been observed.

## 7. Formed elements of the blood

Stein and Moore reported in 1954 that the taurine content of hemic cells was higher than that of plasma (641). Subsequent studies have shown that both platelets (321, 470, 497) and leukocytes (509) are rich in taurine. The concentration of taurine in human platelets is reported to be in the range of 16–24 mmoles/kg platelet water (260, 475, 610, 634); the concentration in leukocytes is even higher, in the range of 20–35 mmoles/kg leukocyte water (476, 610, 634). In contrast, the concentration in erythrocytes is only 50–70 μmoles/kg erythrocyte water, a concentration equal to that in plasma but 2–500 times lower than that in platelets and leukocytes (476, 634). These figures have been calculated assuming a water content of platelets of 75–85 %, of leukocytes of 75 %, and of erythrocytes of 65 %

(634). Assuming a mean blood volume of 6 liters, a hematocrit of 50%, and leukocyte and platelet volumes of 1% and 0.5%, respectively, Soupart calculated that plasma contains 120 μmoles of taurine with erythrocytes 95 μmoles, leukocytes 1200 μmoles, and platelets 560 μmoles (634). It is readily apparent from this calculation that leakage of taurine from damaged leukocytes and platelets into plasma can profoundly influence the results of analyses of plasma taurine, as well as estimations of the renal clearance of taurine (see below).

The content of taurine in platelets and leukocytes from patients with various blood dyscrasias may vary considerably from the normal (478, 582–584). In particular, the taurine content of leukocytes from patients with lymphatic leukemia is significantly lower than that of leukocytes from patients with other forms of leukemia (478).

Taurine in platelets may originate either by active uptake from plasma or by endogenous synthesis. In rats given ³⁵S-taurine, radioactivity presumed to be taurine appeared in the cells of the bone marrow and in platelets after varying periods (683). Human platelets have been shown to contain increased amounts of taurine after incubation with cysteine or CA and to convert ³⁵S-cysteine to ³⁵S-taurine (260). The role of taurine in platelets and leukocytes is not known, and the mechanisms responsible for maintaining the extremely high intracellular concentrations remain to be studied.

### 8. Urine

#### a. Adults. After glycine, taurine is the most abundant ninhydrin-positive compound in adult human urine (632, 634). The amount of taurine excreted daily varies markedly from one individual to another and in the same individual from day to day. In addition, values obtained by different methods may vary (628). For these reasons the normal range of daily taurine excretion is difficult to define. In a number of studies (76, 242, 339, 437, 503, 686) reported values for daily taurine excretion were in the range 220–1850 μmoles, accepted as the limits of normal by Soupart (632, 634) and by Scriver (612). Other studies indicate that the lower limit of normal may be about 140 μmoles/day (444) and the upper limit as high as 2350–2650 μmoles/day (533, 534, 639). In view of these wide ranges, reports purporting to demonstrate hyper- or hypotaurinuria must be accepted with caution. Careful studies in which factors known to influence the level of taurine excretion were controlled (see below) would be of great value in defining the normal range of taurine excretion.

Studies of the renal clearance of taurine have been carried out by a number of investigators (32, 77, 171, 194, 242, 633, 634), and widely different values, ranging from 0.2 to 20 ml/min, have been reported. As discussed previously, these variations in taurine clearance may result in part from uncertainty about the true levels of taurine in plasma. Calculations of the percentage of filtered taurine, which is reabsorbed in the renal tubules, give an average value of 94.2%, indicating that after histidine, taurine is the amino acid handled least efficiently by the kidney (77, 194, 513, 514, 634).

b. Children. Taurine is the major ninhydrin-positive compound in the urine of newborn babies (74, 339, 715), and full-term infants excrete substantially more taurine than premature infants (255, 339, 351). Quantitative studies have shown that the urinary excretion of taurine during the first 24 hr of life exceeds that of all other amino acids combined. The mean excretion in 10 infants studied prior to protein intake was 3.42 μmoles/mg creatinine, or about 55 μmoles (31). During the first few weeks of life the daily taurine excretion declines (75, 255, 339, 611, 715), but later it increases again, perhaps as a result of an increase in the glomerular filtration rate (339, 715). Clearance studies in premature and full-term infants at the age of 1–2 months show taurine values in the range of 0.1–3.8 ml/min per 1.73 m² body area and a tubular reabsorption of 95–99 % (513, 514), which is more efficient than the reabsorption in adults and in older children (613). Information is not available on the clearance and reabsorption of taurine in the immediate postpartum period. No decision can therefore be reached as to whether the large excretion of taurine in that period reflects the concurrent hypertaurinemia or the immaturity of the renal transport system, as suggested in explanation of the general hyperaminoaciduria of premature and full-term infants (611).

The excretion of taurine in older children has been studied in some detail (74–77, 113, 534, 613). In a group of 8 boys and 7 girls, aged 9 months to 2 years, the average excretion of taurine/24 hr was 52 μmoles, with a range of 18–112 μmoles (76, 77). In another group, aged 3–12 years, taurine excretion averaged 430 μmoles/day, with a range of 63–970 μmoles (113). Clearance determinations in a group of children, aged 3–10 years, showed an average value for taurine of 13.7 ml/min per 1.73 m², with a range of 9.9–26.2 ml/min per 1.73 m² (613).

B. Factors Influencing Urinary Taurine Excretion

1. Genetic factors

Several attempts have been made to establish that urinary taurine excretion is controlled in part by genetic factors (73, 216, 272, 650). Berry (73) compared inter- and intraindividual variations in the concentration of taurine in morning specimens of urine from 272 normal subjects and found a ratio of 4.4 between inter- and intraindividual variances, the difference probably not being significant. Although the level of taurine excretion has been found to be characteristic for each individual, analyses of urinary taurine in 16 sib-pairs failed to show greater resemblance of values in siblings than in unrelated persons (650). The intrapair variance ratio for dizygotic vs. monozygotic twins was reported to be 2.8, which is significant at the 5 % level but not at the 1 % level (272). More recently, multivariate analyses of the urinary excretion of the five amino acids, glycine, alanine, glutamine, serine, and taurine, have shown that taurine comes closest to the statistical value to be expected if the excretion of taurine is a single dominant inherited trait (216). The available evidence suggests that the excretion of taurine may be governed partly by genetic factors, although definite proof is still lacking. Support for an effect on

taurine excretion of genetic factors comes from studies in mongolism, discussed in section VII, *E*.

2. **Age**

The excretion of taurine in newborn infants, older children, and adults has been reviewed in the previous section. Increasing excretion of taurine with advancing age was reported in one study (17), but no substantiating data are available.

3. **Sex**

Taurine excretion is the same in males and females at all ages studied (113, 503, 534, 632, 634).

4. **Diet**

In general, the excretion of amino acids is not affected greatly by the intake of protein, with the exception of l-methylhistidine (634). Taurine excretion seems relatively uninfluenced by the amount of protein ingested (89, 476), but increases in taurine excretion have been observed after ingestion of meat or a protein-rich diet (89, 404, 534, 639, 686). The greater excretion of taurine by normal persons in the United States (639) than in England (242) has been taken to reflect the higher consumption of meat in the United States (242). Paradoxically, in extreme protein-deficiency states such as kwashiorkor, taurine excretion increases, but returns to normal levels after ingestion of adequate protein (76, 221, 634, 695). The increase in taurine precursors away from protein synthesis or from a concomitant deficiency of certain vitamins (see below). Excretion of taurine is increased by administration of cysteine (653) but apparently not by administration of methionine (89).

The amount of taurine excreted probably is dependent to some extent on the amount of taurine ingested in the food. Many common foods contain considerable taurine, in particular meat and seafood (573, 575). Thus, the difference in the average excretion of taurine by individuals in the United States and England could result from differences in the intake of taurine rather than of protein. The fact that the taurine content of human milk is higher than that of cow's milk (29) may explain why taurine excretion is higher in infants fed on breast milk than on cow's milk (227, 255, 339, 351).

5. **Vitamins**

Taurine excretion may be altered by deficiencies of several vitamins. Pyridoxine deficiency causes a decrease in the excretion of taurine in man (653), as well as in the rat (83, 84, 165, 326, 399, 488, 510). In a group of Japanese children,

aged 9–12 years, whose diet was thought to contain insufficient amounts of vitamins A and B-complex, the average excretion of taurine was 900 μmoles/day (400), which is considerably above the normal average excretion for that age (113). Interestingly, supplementation of the diet with B vitamins, including pantothenate, caused a drop in the average excretion of taurine to 440 μmoles/day (400). Pantothenate deficiency is known to cause hypertaurinuria in rats (399, 463), which may be indirect evidence in support of the existence of the cysteamine-hypotaurine-taurine pathway in that species.

Vitamin B₁₂ appears to have an unexplained effect on the urinary excretion of taurine. Paper chromatographic studies of urine from untreated patients with pernicious anemia have demonstrated an aminoaciduria characterized by excessive excretion of taurine (187, 254, 367, 681, 701), which decreases after institution of therapy with vitamin B₁₂ (187, 254, 367, 701). Confirmation of these observations by ion-exchange chromatographic studies is required, however, before they can be unequivocally accepted.

### 6. Hormones

Urinary taurine excretion shows no changes with the menstrual cycle (633) and is not influenced by estrogens (726). A significant increase in taurine excretion was demonstrated in males receiving 100 mg of progesterone for 5 days (728). The excretion of taurine during pregnancy reportedly decreased in one case (30), but studies on a larger series of pregnant women showed that the decrease is not statistically significant (728).

A correlation between excretion of taurine and of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids was found by Turner and Blum (686). A number of studies have demonstrated increased taurine excretion after administration of ACTH (213, 534, 577) or glucocorticoids (375, 534), although in one study cortisol had no effect on taurine excretion (727). An effect of glucocorticoids on taurine excretion could be consequent to an increase in protein and amino acid catabolism, but definitive demonstration of increased taurine formation after steroid therapy is lacking. Alternatively, the glucocorticoid-induced increase in taurine excretion could represent liberation of taurine from taurine-rich tissues, such as leukocytes. Some support for this view is discussed later.

### C. Conditions Associated with Hypertaurinuria

The wide range in daily taurine excretion makes it difficult to define the point at which abnormal amounts are excreted. Somewhat arbitrarily, absolute hypertaurinuria can be assumed to exist if the daily excretion exceeds 2500 μmoles (312.5 mg) in adults and 1200 μmoles (150 mg) in children under 12 years. These values are about 3 times the average values for adults (612, 632, 634) and children (113).

The term “relative hypertaurinuria” is used here to describe an increase in

the excretion of taurine above that of a control period but not above 1200 μmoles in children and 2500 μmoles in adults.

### 1. Radiation-induced hypertaurinuria

Accidental exposure to radiation or various forms of treatment with X rays have been shown to cause a generalized aminoaciduria in which hypertaurinuria may be a prominent feature (21, 76, 114, 313, 340, 359, 403, 404, 478, 634, 686). The hypertaurinuria is mostly relative, but in some instances is absolute (114, 634, 686). It is maximal 1–2 days after irradiation, after which it regresses, but persistence for longer periods has been observed (686). Radiation-induced hypertaurinuria is well documented in rats (13–15, 24, 25, 93, 94, 260, 288, 319, 353, 360–362, 364, 365, 483, 510, 530, 604, 605, 629, 642, 700); it is less marked and more variable in other animals such as mice, dogs, rabbits, and guinea pigs (24, 25, 318, 485). Four possible causes of radiation-induced hypertaurinuria have recently been discussed by Fromageot and Boquet (266): 1) impaired renal reabsorption of taurine, 2) increased catabolism of sulfur-amino acids to taurine, 3) leakage of taurine from taurine-rich cells, and 4) impaired catabolism of taurine to other sulfur compounds.

Impaired renal reabsorption of taurine as the cause of radiation-induced hypertaurinuria appears to be excluded by the finding, both in man and the rat, that the concentration of taurine in plasma after irradiation is transiently increased (76, 365, 634). This indicates that the hypertaurinuria is prerenal in origin.

If radiation did cause an increase in taurine formation, the specific activity of taurine excreted by rats injected with ${}^{35}$S-taurine prior to irradiation might be expected to be low because of dilution with newly formed taurine. Release of preformed taurine would be without influence on the specific activity of urinary taurine if the excess taurine came from a taurine pool in isotopic equilibrium with plasma. ${}^{35}$S-taurine was injected into rats either at the same time as (629) or 3–5 days before (93, 94, 605) irradiation. The specific activity of urinary taurine excreted after irradiation was not significantly decreased. These results indicate not only that the excess taurine that appears in the urine after irradiation is derived from a pool of preformed taurine, but also that this pool must be present in tissues achieving rapid isotopic equilibrium with injected ${}^{35}$S-taurine. This points to such tissues as the liver, kidneys, or spleen as the probable source of taurine, whereas muscle and heart tissue, which achieve isotopic equilibrium only after 5 days, can be excluded (93). Other studies indicate that the source of excess taurine is intra-abdominal, since shielding the abdominal area prevents postirradiation hypertaurinuria. Attempts to locate the source by shielding or irradiating single intra-abdominal organs have been unsuccessful (364). Hypertaurinuria after radiation has been shown to occur in the absence of the thymus (530), spleen (364, 530), kidneys, adrenals, and pituitary (364), whereas pancreatectomy apparently reduces the response to radiation (364).

Studies by Watson (700) have raised the possibility that the source of excess taurine is the lymphoid tissue with its taurine-rich cells (cf. refs. 376, 377).

excretion of taurine by rats was increased to the same extent by exposure to 570 r and treatment with 60 mg of cortisone. Pretreatment with cortisone (15 mg daily for 7 days) abolished the response to radiation. The prevention by cortisone of radiation-induced hypertaurinuria was ascribed to reduction in the number of leukocytes in the circulation and the lymphoid tissue brought about by glucocorticoids (220). The suggestion that lymphoid tissue is the source of the excess taurine in the urine after irradiation is compatible with other observations. The correspondence between radiation dose and amount of excess taurine in the urine is demonstrable only at doses up to 500 r (15, 362). Furthermore, 1–2 weeks must elapse between exposures before an effect on taurine excretion can be reproduced (353, 364). In patients with leukemia X-ray treatment is followed by marked hypertaurinuria (76, 114, 404, 478, 634). In their review Fromageot and Boquet (266) raised the objection that destruction of all the lymphoid tissue of the rat would not release enough taurine to account for the amount excreted after radiation, although some of the excess taurine might be accounted for in that fashion. They suggested that an additional factor is a decrease in the conversion of taurine to other sulfur compounds, basing this view on observations that showed radiation decreases the excretion of inorganic sulfate in the urine. Other studies have shown that the excretion of inorganic sulfate by animals exposed to radiation is variable, either increasing (360, 363, 629), remaining unchanged (15, 629), or decreasing (318). Another observation by Boquet and Fromageot may be interpreted to support the hypothesis that radiation causes hypertaurinuria by decreasing the extrarenal removal of taurine. In rats made severely deficient in pyridoxine, post-irradiation hypertaurinuria is minimal or absent (93). An abnormally small percentage of injected taurine is recovered in the urine of pyridoxine-deficient rats (93), even though the total content of taurine in such rats is normal (92). This suggests that the extrarenal removal of taurine is relatively increased in pyridoxine-deficient rats. When such rats are simultaneously irradiated and given 150 μmoles of taurine, the excretion of taurine in the urine in the following 48 hr is 2–3 times greater than the sum of the excretions after either procedure alone. This observation is compatible with an inhibiting effect of radiation on the extrarenal removal of taurine, but the specific site at which radiation acts is unknown.

Postirradiation hypertaurinuria is modified not only by pyridoxine deficiency but also by administration of cysteamine (13, 15) or cysteine (318, 319) prior to irradiation. Although taurine excretion is increased by both these compounds, the combined effects of irradiation and administration of cysteamine or cysteine are not additive, suggesting a sparing action. Hewitt has shown that the percentage of ³⁵S-cysteine recovered in urinary taurine is the same in irradiated and nonirradiated rats (319). These findings suggest that cysteine is capable of preventing the radiation-induced release of tissue taurine. The mechanism underlying this action of cysteine (and possibly also cysteamine) is not clear.

## 2. Trauma

Relative and in some instances absolute hypertaurinuria has been reported after such traumatic events as burns (507), surgical procedures (74, 686), and

febrile convulsions (74), as well as after acute infections, such as pneumonia or wound infections (74, 75, 686). Taurine excretion may also be increased after bouts of acute alcoholism (534, 686). The excretion of taurine in some of these conditions has been as high as 7000 μmoles (875 mg)/day (686). The hypertaurinuria has been attributed to an increase in adrenal cortical activity (507, 534, 686). Turner and Blum have found a correlation between the excretion of taurine and of 17-hydroxycorticosteroids (686). The evidence indicating an effect of glucocorticoids on taurine excretion has been reviewed in a previous section.

### 3. Muscle disorders

Since 75% of the total content of taurine in the body is found in muscle tissue (642), abnormalities in the excretion of taurine might be expected to occur in muscle disorders. Some studies have shown a generalized aminoaciduria in cases of myotonia dystrophica (78) and a significant increase in the excretion of taurine (331) and other amino acids (19, 57, 78, 602) in a number of patients with muscular dystrophy. Hypertaurinuria has also been reported in one case of acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis (96). Other studies, using ion-exchange chromatography, have reported normal excretion of amino acids, including taurine, in two patients with infantile progressive atrophy and one with myotonia dystrophica (112); the daily excretion of taurine in three children, aged 7–12 years, with muscular dystrophy of the Duchenne type was between 32 and 124 μmoles (57), values well below normal for that age (113). One 54-year-old patient with the limb-girdle type of muscular dystrophy was reported to excrete 190 μmoles of taurine per day (112), which is also below the normal range previously defined. These findings indicate that hypotaurinuria may be found in some cases of muscular dystrophy and perhaps other progressive muscle disorders leading to muscular atrophy. It is of interest that the urinary excretion of ISA has recently been reported to be significantly decreased in eight patients with muscular atrophy, four of whom had progressive muscular dystrophy (336).

### 4. Liver disease

Relative hypertaurinuria as part of a generalized aminoaciduria may be found in patients with severe acute or chronic liver disease (211, 387, 437, 695, 699, 714), although it is not an invariable finding (328, 399). The hypertaurinuria is of the overflow type, as previously discussed, but no studies on the metabolic disturbance that results in elevated levels of taurine in the plasma and the urine appear to have been done.

### 5. Bone disease

Hypertaurinuria has been reported in several studies of children with epiphysiolyis, idiopathic scoliosis, and Calve-Legg-Perthes’ disease (541, 603, 637).

In a group of scoliotic children, 11–15 years old, the average excretion of taurine, determined by paper chromatography and quantitation, was 900 μmoles/day, ranging from 536 to 1340 μmoles/day (637). These values are higher than the average for younger children aged 3–12 (113) but within the normal adult limits (612, 632, 634). Three children with epiphysiolyis, 11–14 years old, excreted 1000, 1600, and 2670 μmoles of taurine/day, respectively (541), levels that are clearly abnormal. The pathology of epiphysiolyis bears some resemblance to that of experimental lathyrisim. Cystamine, a known precursor of taurine, reportedly produces lesions similar to those produced by β-aminopropionitrile in experimental lathyrisim (541). The question of a derangement in sulfur amino acids in these bone disorders warrants further studies with more precise methods.

### 6. Renal aminoacidurias

Relative hypertaurinuria may be part of a generalized renal aminoaciduria (74, 695), although not invariably (242, 339, 640, 695). The finding of normal urinary excretion of taurine (and proline), together with excessive excretion of neutral amino acids, suggests Hartnup’s disease (242). A more specific type of hypertaurinuria occurs as part of the metabolic disorder recently described as hyper-β-alaninemis (614). In this disease, hypertaurinuria is renal in origin, resulting from competitive inhibition by β-alanine of taurine reabsorption in the proximal tubules. An association between hypertaurinuria and camptodactyly, a rare familial deformity of the hands, has recently been suggested (508). The hypertaurinuria was considered to be renal, since plasma taurine levels were in the normal range, but quantitative data on the urinary excretion of taurine were not reported, and a single determination of the renal clearance of taurine yielded a value of 13.8 ml/min, which is within the normal range of 0.2–20 ml/min found by others (32). Further studies are needed to substantiate the claim that camptodactyly is associated with excessive urinary excretion of taurine.

#### D. Taurine in Disorders of Sulfur Amino Acid Metabolism

The available information is still too incomplete to permit any statement about the relative contributions of ingested and endogenously synthesized taurine to the taurine pools in human tissues and body fluids. In the previous subsections, the known effects of exogenous taurine on taurine in plasma, urine, and tissues have been reviewed. Some evidence of the importance of endogenous synthesis of taurine for the maintenance of normal taurine concentrations in tissues and body fluids may be obtained by reviewing the information on conditions in which endogenous synthesis of taurine may be decreased.

One such condition is pyridoxine deficiency. The effect of pyridoxine deficiency on tissue and urinary taurine levels in animals has been discussed (see section III, B). Studies by Swan et al. (653) have shown that urinary excretion of taurine is also decreased in normal human subjects given a pyridoxine-deficient diet (653). These investigators did not report the effect of pyridoxine deficiency on

taurine concentrations in tissues or plasma, nor was the taurine content of the food ingested kept constant. The observed decrease in urinary taurine excretion in pyridoxine deficiency therefore does not allow any conclusions regarding the importance of taurine biosynthesis in the maintenance of tissue taurine pools. Studies in pyridoxine-deficient rats have shown normal tissue taurine concentrations and total body content of taurine despite low urinary taurine excretion (see section III, B).

Another approach to the question is to examine the levels of taurine in tissues and body fluids of patients with inborn errors of metabolism of sulfur amino acids. At present, six distinct disorders have been recognized: hypermethioninemia, homocystinuria, cystathioninuria, cystinosis, cystinuria, and sulfituria.

### 1. Hypermethioninemia

This metabolic defect has been detected only recently, and few biochemical studies have been reported so far. The taurine content in the brain of one child dying at the age of 3 months was normal, 1.8 μmole/g wet weight tissue (cf. ref. 520), and the concentration in plasma and urine was stated to be lower than normal (535). The plasma level, however, was 90 μmoles/liter, which in other studies is considered normal (see section VII, A).

### 2. Homocystinuria

Taurine concentration in brain tissue from two patients with this disorder has been reported as normal (102). In two other patients urinary excretion of taurine was normal in one and less than 8 μmoles/24 hr in the other (274). The latter patient was 1 month old, an age at which taurine excretion is low (75, 255, 339, 611, 715).

### 3. Cystathioninuria

This disorder is rare; only five cases have been reported to date (537). Taurine levels in plasma and urine were recorded as normal in one case (261); no data were given in the other cases.

### 4. Cystinosis

The metabolic defect causing this disorder is unknown (425). Taurine levels have been reported to be normal in liver tissues, but reduced in platelets from cystinotic patients (438). Plasma levels of taurine were reported as 72 μmoles/liter in one study (438) and between 54 and 120 μmoles/liter in another (105). These values are within normal limits (see above), although the value of 72 μmoles/liter

was considered to be elevated. Urinary excretion of taurine has been reported to  
be low in cystinosis (716), but the wide variation found normally requires further  
confirmation of this claim.

5. Cystinuria

In this disorder, absorption of cystine in the renal tubules and the intestine is  
impaired (389). The loss of this precursor of taurine from the body might possibly  
affect the concentrations of taurine in tissues and body fluids if these were main-  
tained at normal levels primarily by biosynthesis of taurine. No data were found on  
tissue concentrations of taurine in cystinuric patients. Taurine concentrations in  
plasma were given as between 32 and 150 μmoles/liter in one study (32) and be-  
tween 36 and 227 μmoles/liter in another (262). These values are normal, but the  
wide variations suggest that some of the taurine measured may have come from  
platelets and leukocytes, as discussed previously. A definitely low plasma concen-  
tration of 16 μmoles/liter was found in one cystinuric patient by Brigham et al.  
(105); by their method taurine concentrations in plasma normally range between  
33 and 66 μmoles/liter. Urinary excretion of taurine in cystinuria, however, is  
clearly below normal. In five cystinuric patients studied by Stein taurine excretion  
ranged from 64 to 688 μmoles/24 hr (638), and in another group of 33 male and  
female cystinuric patients it ranged between 250 and 350 μmoles/24 hr (298). Of  
the seven cystinurics studied by King, all excreted less than 160 μmoles/24 hr (375).  
Taurine may not be the only urinary sulfur compound excreted in less than normal  
amounts by such patients. In unpublished experiments, we found that the excretion  
of ISA by a cystinuric patient was 5.6 mg/24 hr, compared with a normal average  
excretion of 13.7 ± 4.2 (sd) mg/24 hr (336).

6. Sulfituria

This newly discovered disorder has been described only briefly (422a). The  
enzyme defect has been demonstrated to be that of sulfite oxidase. No defect in  
taurine metabolism was described nor would any be anticipated.

In summary, the limited data available do not suggest that taurine concentra-  
tions in tissues or body fluids are abnormal in patients with enzymatic defects in  
some pathways of taurine biosynthesis. This may be attributable to the existence of  
alternative pathways in taurine biosynthesis, as previously discussed, and to the  
origin of taurine in part from exogenous sources.

E. Taurine and Mental Retardation

Interest in biochemical aberrations associated with mental retardation has  
grown rapidly in recent years with the demonstration that a large number of in-  
born errors of metabolism may lead to mental retardation. The presence of taurine  
in considerable amounts in the mammalian brain (see Table 4) and the possible role

of taurine as an inhibitor in the transmission of nerve impulses (see section VIII, C) make it worth while to examine the available information on taurine in tissues and body fluids of patients with various mental diseases.

Urinary excretion of taurine in amounts less than 160 μmoles/day has been reported in three phenylketonuric children (242, 375), in a 2-year-old patient with idiopathic hyperglycinemia (511), and in seven children with various lesions of the central nervous system. Of the latter, six were mentally retarded; the seventh, who had progressive myoclonic epilepsy, excreted only 35 μmoles of taurine/day (375). These values are all well below the average for normal children in the 3- to 12-year age group (113), but the influence of poor nutrition, vitamin deficiencies, and subnormal muscular development cannot be properly assessed.

Of considerably greater interest are observations on the urinary excretion of taurine in patients with mongolism. In a series of studies, Goodman et al. found that mongoloids excrete significantly less taurine than normal controls of the same age (283, 375, 679, 697). This finding was confirmed by McCoy and Wehrle (473). Studying 47 institutionalized mongoloids, King et al. (375) found that 66% excreted less than 200 μmoles/day (or per liter), whereas only 6% of normal controls excreted such low amounts. The excretion of taurine by mongoloids was not related to the levels of taurine in plasma (375), and the difference between mongoloids and normal controls remained significant when mongoloids below 18 years were excluded from the calculations (283, 375). Associations, significant at the 5% level, were found between the levels of urinary taurine and two measures of adaptive behavior as an indication of intelligence. Calculations indicated that 10–20% of the reduction in intelligence could be accounted for by the observed correlations (679), with a number of assumptions concerning this extrapolation.

Studies with ${}^{35}$S-taurine have shown that mongoloids with low taurine excretion excrete virtually no ${}^{35}$S-taurine but do excrete at least two nontaurine ${}^{35}$S-labeled compounds that behave chromatographically like either neutral or strongly acid metabolites of taurine (697). Recently reported evidence indicates that one of the acid metabolites is ISA (284), known from another study to be a normal constituent of human urine (336). The response of mongoloids to a high-protein diet or to taurine orally in doses of 1.5–12 mg/kg body weight has also been studied (375). In mongoloids excreting low amounts of taurine, the excretion of taurine rose little or not at all after oral taurine loading, but those excreting intermediate amounts responded with a three- to fivefold rise in taurine excretion. These results are reminiscent of the response of pyridoxine-deficient rats to taurine administration (93), and excretion of taurine by mongoloids has, in fact, been shown to increase considerably after administration of pyridoxine in doses of 50 mg by mouth for 1–3 weeks (375).

These observations suggest that trisomy of chromosome number 21, the chromosomal abnormality characteristic of mongolism (426), is associated with some abnormality in the metabolism of taurine, or perhaps more likely of pyridoxine. Other evidence indicates that the requirement for pyridoxine is increased in mongolism (375). The difference in taurine excretion between mongoloids and

normal subjects has been attributed to a genetic overdose effect, resulting from the state of trisomy in mongolism (375). Goodman has proposed a model that permits calculation of the phenotypic shifts to be expected in trisomic populations (282). The data on taurine excretion and on gene frequencies in mongoloids are as yet too scanty to allow rigorous application of the model (375).

Information on taurine levels in the tissues of mongoloids might throw light on the hypotaurinuria of mongolism, but no such data appear to be available. According to W. L. Nyhan (personal communication), taurine levels in brain tissue from 5 mongoloids were 1.4–8.2 μmoles/g wet weight tissue, which is in the normal range for the nonfetal human brain (see Table 4). Although this argues against any gross abnormality in tissue taurine levels in mongolism, an effect of trisomy on taurine metabolism might be demonstrable by more sensitive methods. In view of the demonstration of conversion of taurine to ISA by rat brain (529), similar studies of normal and mongoloid brain should be done, as well as further studies dealing with the biosynthesis, disposition, and further metabolism of taurine in mongoloids.

### F. Taurine and Psoriasis

The human skin contains considerable amounts of taurine, both in the cutis and epidermis (427, 574). Roe has suggested that a relationship exists between taurine and psoriasis. She based this suggestion on observations of the skin lesions under various dietary and therapeutic conditions that may affect taurine excretion. Cholestyramine, which increases the fecal excretion of taurine, reduced the symptoms of psoriasis (572). Ingestion of taurine-rich foods had an adverse effect on the skin lesions, whereas dietary measurements designed to reduce taurine intake brought about considerable improvement in the extent and severity of the lesions (573–575). Psoriatic patients maintained on a diet low in taurine showed a greater retention of a taurine load than did normal subjects on a similar diet. Suggestive evidence was obtained that taurine may accumulate in bound form in the psoriatic lesions when the intake of taurine is high (574). Confirmation of these observations has not yet appeared. Farber reported that only 2 of 22 psoriatic patients given 2 g of taurine noticed a slight increase in the itching or erythema of the lesions (574). Further studies are required to establish a possible role of taurine in psoriasis.

In summary, the available information on taurine in human body fluids, in particular in urine, has been reviewed. No clear-cut relationship of taurine to disease has as yet been established. Particular attention is now being directed to trying to define a role of this compound in mongolism and psoriasis.

## VIII. FUNCTIONS OF TAURINE

The earlier sections of this review presented evidence attesting to the antiquity and ubiquity of taurine in biological systems. This evidence and that of taurine

biosynthesis and further metabolism suggest that taurine must have physiological functions beyond that of its role in the formation of bile acids (229, 327). In this final section a summary of current evidence for the function of taurine is given.

Taurine appears to have remarkably few pharmacological effects. No side effects have been reported in studies in which patients have ingested up to 15 g of taurine daily (311, 433, 574, 623, 684). This amount of taurine is probably 50–100 times the normal intake, estimated to be 40–400 mg daily in man (574). Scattered reports suggest that taurine may induce a moderate hypoglycemia (5), possibly by potentiating the action of insulin (219, 445). Taurine in doses of 10–50 mg/100 g body weight may cause a transient fall in blood pressure in rats (141), although it has no effect on blood pressure in dogs (5). It may have a vasodilatory effect (646, 685) and may increase the cardiac rate in toads, frogs, and rabbits (646). Addition of taurine in vitro has been reported to delay the coagulation of blood (645) and to inhibit the growth of tubercle bacilli (550). Taurine has also been claimed to result in improvement in guinea pigs and rabbits with experimentally induced tuberculosis (657). In general, the doses of taurine required to produce these effects make it unlikely that search in these areas for a physiological role of taurine will be rewarding.

There are perhaps five areas of animal physiology in which taurine or one of its immediate derivatives may play more than an incidental role. These areas are osmoregulation in marine invertebrates, energy storage in certain worms, inhibition of nerve impulses in invertebrate and vertebrate nerve tissue, elimination of cholesterol in vertebrates, and the regulation of excitability in various tissues.

### A. Osmoregulation

High intracellular concentrations of free amino acids, including taurine, are characteristic of many marine invertebrates (41, 378, 620). In many euryhaline species, which are capable of adapting to life at different salinities, changes in the osmolality of the milieu extérieur lead to adaptive changes in the intracellular concentration of amino acids, in particular proline, glycine, alanine, and trimethylamine (250, 440). Krogh, noting the high concentrations of taurine in molluscs, such as *Mytilus*, *Pecten*, and *Sepia*, pointed to a role for taurine in the regulation of osmotic pressure in these and other marine animals (405). In 1952 Baldwin wrote, “Conceivably taurine plays an important part in regulating the osmotic pressure of the contents of those cells, in which it is present in high amounts” (49). In determining the amino acid composition of a large number of molluscs by means of paper chromatography, Simpson et al. (41, 620) found a close correlation between the occurrence of taurine and the habitat of the animals studied. Taurine was detectable in all marine species, but was not present in freshwater and terrestrial gastropods and pelecypods. Proof of the participation of taurine in the adaptive changes occurring upon transfer from one salinity to another has been obtained

only in a few instances. The concentration of free amino acids in muscle and byssus of *Mytilus* transferred to 50% sea water decreases by about 33%, and the concentration of taurine in muscle falls from 91 to 66 mmoles/kg total water (547). A linear correlation of salinity and total amino acid concentration in *Mytilus* was also found by Lange. He obtained evidence suggesting that taurine concentration increased relatively more than other amino acid concentrations with increasing salinity, and that it thereby exerted a sparing effect on the use of essential amino acids in osmoregulation (422).

The effect of changes in salinity on the tissue content of taurine has been examined in four crustaceans. No significant changes were observed in *Leander serratus* (342), *Leander squilla* (342), or *Eriocheir sinensis* (104). In the fourth species, *Carcinus maenas*, transfer of the crustaceans to dilute sea water was followed by a reduction in the concentration in muscle of the dominant amino acids, taurine and trimethylamine oxide, to levels below those expected from the increased water content of the tissue (616). Finally, a close linear relationship has been demonstrated between the salinity of the surrounding milieu and the concentration of taurine in the echinoderm *Asterias rubens* (343, 344).

The participation of taurine in the regulation of osmotic pressure may not be confined to marine invertebrates. The taurine content of muscle (286), but not of brain tissue (52), from two species of toads was shown to increase significantly when the animals were transferred from fresh to 40% sea water.

The available evidence for a possible role of taurine in osmoregulation is limited to the species mentioned above. The occurrence of taurine in large amounts in many marine invertebrates (see Table 2) suggests that further studies may disclose a more general role of taurine in the adaptive changes occurring in euryhaline species. A discussion of possible mechanisms responsible for variations in intracellular amino acid concentrations at different salinities may be found in the recent review by Florkin and Schoffeniels (250).

### B. Energy Storage

As discussed in section VI, C, a limited number of species belonging to the phyla Annelida and Sipuncula contain the guanido derivatives of taurine and hypotaurine, taurocyamine and hypotaurocyamine, and possess the enzymic means of forming the corresponding phosphagens, phosphataurocyamine and phosphohypotaurocyamine. Hypotaurine and taurine are members of the list of compounds that invertebrates use in the formation of phosphagens (240, 671, 673). Although taurocyamine has been identified in other invertebrate species (11, 453, 566, 569) and also in tissues from some mammals (87, 667, 674), phosphataurocyamine has not. There is little evidence at present that either taurine or hypotaurine after conversion to guanido derivatives and phosphorylation plays a significant role in the storage of energy in other than a few species of worms.

C. Inhibition of Nerve Impulses

Taurine is a structural analogue of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), differing from it in having 2 instead of 3 carbon atoms and in the nature of the acidic moiety. The pharmacological properties and possible physiological role of GABA as a specific inhibitor of impulse transmission in the central nervous system have recently been reviewed in detail (189, 193). These reviews also present the available information on the action of amino acids related to GABA. Numerous reports show that taurine inhibits the transmission of nerve impulses in a variety of mammalian and nonmammalian test preparations (188, 190, 191, 193, 223, 230, 401, 402). On a molar basis the inhibitory effect of taurine is considerably smaller than that of GABA (191, 230, 402), but the ratio of the potencies of taurine and of GABA seems to depend on the particular system studied. In analogy with the excitatory effect of glutamic acid (the precursor of GABA) two precursors of taurine, L-cysteic and L-cysteinesulfonic acids, have excitatory effects on impulse transmission in various test preparations (190, 192). The three-carbon-atom analogues of L-cysteic acid and taurine, homocysteic acid and homotaurine (3-amino-propanesulfonic acid), have excitatory and inhibitory effects, respectively, which are even more potent than those of L-cysteic acid and taurine (192, 193, 713).

Knowledge about the intracellular location and the distribution of GABA in various parts of the central nervous system, as well as the enzymes involved in the synthesis and further metabolism of this compound, is considerable (see ref. 193). Similar information about taurine is limited to a few observations. Taurine content of different areas of the human brain varies markedly (520), whereas in lobster nerve, the content of taurine in motor and inhibitory axons is the same (401). No other studies have been reported on the distribution of taurine in nervous tissue. No information is available on the intracellular location of taurine or of the enzymes catalyzing the synthesis and further metabolism of taurine in nervous tissue. Elucidation of these factors might allow taurine to meet the requirements of a chemical transmitter (275) and establish its role in neurophysiology.

D. Synthesis of Bile Salts

Bile acids synthesized from cholesterol are largely conjugated with glycine and taurine prior to excretion in the bile (195). Conjugation of bile acids with taurine occurs in most vertebrates above the selachians. Conjugation with glycine, on the other hand, is a phylogenetically recent trait, present only in mammals, in particular those with herbivorous feeding habits (305). Recent experiments in dogs and rats demonstrate that the transfer of cholic acid from blood to bile is increased by conjugation with taurine (99, 522, 523).

Free bile acids and those conjugated with glycine and taurine are important in the intestinal absorption of fat, contributing to the processes of lipolysis, micelle formation, and re-esterification of fatty acids within intestinal mucosal cells. The participation of taurine in bile salt formation is its most firmly established physio-

logical function. Lipolysis in the gut is enhanced by both free and conjugated bile acids (94a). Normal micelle formation, on the other hand, is dependent on conjugated bile acids such as taurocholate (323a). The steatorrhea seen in the blind-loop syndrome appears to be secondary to deconjugation of bile acids in the small intestine by bacterial action and can be corrected by the administration of taurocholate (373a). Bile salts also stimulate the esterification of long-chain fatty acids in mucosal cells during the process of absorption, although the mechanism of this effect is unclear (198a). (A broad discussion of bile salt formation and function is beyond the scope of this review.)

Conjugation of bile acids with taurine (and with glycine) results remotely in the elimination of cholesterol from the body. If mechanisms controlling synthesis of cholesterol were inadequate, decreased conversion to bile acids and excretion as bile salts might result in hypercholesterolemia. There is some evidence that decreased availability of taurine may be associated with hypercholesterolemia (546). Atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia have been experimentally induced in Cebus monkeys fed a diet high in cholesterol content but low in sulfur-containing amino acids (455, 456). Addition to the diet of methionine, L-cystine, L-cysteine, cystamine, or taurine results in a decrease in the elevated serum cholesterol levels to normal (455). Similar effects of sulfur amino acids, including taurine, on experimentally induced hypercholesterolemia have been reported in rats and mice (246, 317, 615). Cebus monkeys, rats, and mice primarily use taurine for conjugation with bile acids (see ref. 305). Taurine, as taurocholate, may affect cholesterol metabolism in part by controlling the rate of intestinal cholesterogenesis (215a).

Taurine levels in the liver tissue of herbivorous species tend to be low (see Table 4), and conjugation of bile acids with taurine is absent or minimal (101, 305). As anticipated, the administration of taurine to rabbits with experimental hypercholesterolemia does not usually lower serum cholesterol levels (317, 505). In man, conjugation with glycine predominates (232, 311, 622–624, 684), but conjugation with taurine also occurs and may become dominant during its dietary administration (311, 623, 684). The human liver is virtually incapable of synthesizing taurine via CSA and CA (see Table 5). Although ingestion of meat results in ingestion of both cholesterol and taurine, the method of preparation may lead to substantial losses in the taurine content of meat (575). Icing of fish has also been shown to lead to loss of taurine (349). Four studies have been carried out to determine the effect of administered taurine on the level of serum cholesterol in man. Taurine in amounts of 3 g/day for 2 months did not lower the elevated serum cholesterol concentration in 1 patient with myxedema (311), and 1.5 g of taurine/day for 10–15 days did not alter the normal serum cholesterol levels in 4 normal subjects (684). In preliminary studies, Failey and co-workers failed to observe any effect on the serum cholesterol level by an unreported amount of taurine given as a dietary supplement (243). Lieber followed the serum cholesterol levels for 10 months in a group of 15 patients with cardiac insufficiency and antecedent myocardial infarction receiving a daily dose of 1 g of taurine combined with linolenic acid (433). The average serum cholesterol level in these patients before starting the diet was

295 mg/100 ml (range, 234–336 mg/100 ml). After 3 months, the average level had decreased to 264 mg, after 6 months to 241 mg, and after 10 months to 218 mg/100 ml with a range of 193–244 mg/100 ml. These observations require confirmation and more rigid control, with separate evaluation of taurine and linolenic acid.

### E. Regulation of Excitability of Various Tissues

The discovery by Koechlin of large amounts of isethionic acid (ISA), the deaminated analogue of taurine, in the axoplasm of the giant squid suggested that taurine and ISA may play a role in the function of nerve tissue (390–392). Although the presence of ISA in the axoplasm of the giant squid was subsequently confirmed (202), nerve tissue from other crustaceans and vertebrate nerve do not appear to contain ISA in significant amounts (201). A theoretical model, implicating ISA in the conductance changes occurring in the squid axon during excitation, has been proposed by Mullins (501), but Robertson has rejected the view that ISA in the squid axon plays any specific functional role (564). Baker et al. have been able to restore normal action and resting potentials to nerve fibers perfused with either potassium sulfate or potassium isethionate after the removal of the axoplasm (47). The available evidence does not permit any definite conclusion regarding the role of ISA in nerve tissue from the giant squid.

Interest in ISA has recently been renewed by the identification of the compound in dog heart tissue (707) and the demonstration that dog heart slices are able to convert taurine to ISA (552). These observations have led to a number of pharmacological studies with taurine (107, 551, 553, 554, 704–706). In anesthetized vagotomized dogs the administration of taurine in doses of 0.5 mmole/kg body weight prevented the development of epinephrine- or digitoxin-induced premature ventricular contractions, and larger doses abolished already established premature contractions (553, 554, 704, 705). A positive correlation was found between the dose of epinephrine required to induce ventricular ectopic rhythms and the content of ISA in ventricular heart tissue (553, 554, 704, 705). Further studies showed that taurine may prevent the myocardial loss of potassium in dogs given large doses of epinephrine and may promote cellular accumulation of potassium. It may also abolish or reverse the loss of cell potassium from heart slices incubated in the presence of toxic doses of epinephrine or digoxin (553, 554, 706). Recently, taurine has been shown to increase the refractory period of canine ventricular tissue by about 15% (551). These effects of taurine have been assumed to be attributable to ISA formed intracellularly from taurine. This assumption rests in part on the correlation between the dose of epinephrine required for induction of ventricular contractions and the content of ISA. There is also evidence from in vitro experiments that epinephrine and digoxin increase the conversion of ${}^{35}$S-taurine to ${}^{35}$S-ISA (706).

On the basis of these observations, Welty has hypothesized that “taurine and ISA function as the two members of a complex, serving as a slow metabolic feedback system regulating potassium efflux from cardiac cells and secondarily the excitability of cardiac tissue” (704). Byington has recently shown that infusions of

taurine increase the uptake of potassium by the heart (107). Homotaurine, a potent inhibitor of nerve impulse transmission (192, 193, 474), also abolishes digoxin-induced arrhythmias. Interest in ISA is enhanced by the demonstration of the conversion of taurine to ISA in rat brain (529) and of the presence of ISA in human urine (284, 336). How taurine and ISA affect cardiac muscle excitability is not known. It is tempting to speculate that the same mechanism is responsible for the inhibitory effect of taurine and homotaurine on the transmission of nerve impulses and on the excitability of cardiac muscle. This mechanism might be an increase in membrane conductance and permeability to specific ions, as is assumed to be the case with GABA (189, 193, 230) or it might be related to fluxes in calcium (501, 554). Whatever the mechanism, the observed effect of taurine and ISA in the heart suggests a function for this pair of sulfonic acids in excitable tissue.

IX. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

This review has attempted to summarize information on taurine and some of its derivatives. Extensive data demonstrate that taurine is present ubiquitously in animals, but is present in few plants apart from the most primitive organisms. The concentrations of taurine in invertebrate, vertebrate, and mammalian tissues are often remarkably high. Taurine is conjugated with bile acids in many vertebrates above the selachians, but few other roles for taurine in animal physiology are known. The bile salts formed are important in several phases of fat absorption: lipolysis, micelle formation, and intracellular re-esterification of fatty acids. They also control the rate of intestinal cholesterologenesis and indirectly the rate of elimination of cholesterol (as derivative bile acids). A function for taurine in the osmoregulation of certain marine invertebrates appears to be well established. More extensive work along these lines may show that taurine participates in the osmoregulator adaptations of many more euryhaline species than is presently known. There is some evidence that taurine is concerned in impulse transmission in the nervous system. The type of studies previously applied to GABA might be used with advantage with respect to taurine. Much more must be learned about the details of intracellular taurine synthesis and metabolism before it can be accepted as a neuroinhibitor.

Taurine has been recently discovered to have an effect on cardiac excitability, presumably due to its conversion to isethionic acid. It is clear from the data summarized in this review that much remains to be learned about the origin, fate, and function of taurine in biological systems.
