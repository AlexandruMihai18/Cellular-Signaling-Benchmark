INTERLEUKIN-1 AND NEURONAL INJURY

**Stuart M. Allan**, **Pippa J. Tyrrell** and **Nancy J. Rothwell**

Abstract | Interleukin-1 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that has numerous biological effects, including activation of many inflammatory processes (through activation of T cells, for example), induction of expression of acute-phase proteins, an important function in neuroimmune responses and direct effects on the brain itself. There is now extensive evidence to support the direct involvement of interleukin-1 in the neuronal injury that occurs in both acute and chronic neurodegenerative disorders. This article discusses the key evidence of a role for interleukin-1 in acute neurodegeneration — for example, stroke and brain trauma — and provides a rationale for targeting the interleukin-1 system as a therapeutic strategy.

### ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE
A degenerative neurological disease that is characterized by progressive deterioration of the brain, dementia, and the presence of senile plaques, neurofibrillary tangles and neuropil threads. Disease onset can occur at any age, and women seem to be affected more frequently than men.

### MICROGLIAL CELL
A macrophage-lineage cell that is derived from bone marrow and is present in the central nervous system.

For many years the central nervous system (CNS) was considered to be immune privileged, because it does not mount a classical immune response to foreign antigens. However, it is now widely accepted that immune surveillance of the CNS occurs and that immune and inflammatory responses can take place in the brain in response to diverse insults (such as seizures, infection and ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE), although these responses differ from those in the periphery. Inflammation in the brain is characterized by infiltration of circulating immune cells, including neutrophils and monocytes, and by activation of resident cells, including MICROGLIAL CELLS (the key immune cell of the CNS), ASTROCYTES and endothelial cells. These cells can express, release and respond to typical pro-inflammatory mediators, such as cytokines, complement, ACUTE-PHASE PROTEINS and EICOSANOIDS. In the CNS, one of the most widely studied of these mediators is the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-1 (IL-1), and there is considerable evidence indicating that this is a key contributor to a diverse range of neurodegenerative conditions, both acute (such as stroke) and chronic (such as Alzheimer’s disease). So, as we discuss here, understanding the role of IL-1 in the CNS, the mechanisms of IL-1 action and the ways in which IL-1 activity can be regulated is an area of intense research, and it has implications for the design of therapeutics for neurodegenerative conditions.

### The IL-1 family
The IL-1 family has an important role in inflammation and host defence, and it now comprises at least ten molecules¹ (TABLE 1; FIG. 1). IL-1 was originally described more than 50 years ago as the ‘endogenous pyrogen’, because it has pronounced fever-inducing properties in rabbits. Subsequently, it was identified and revealed to consist of two separate ligands, IL-1α and IL-1β². These have high sequence homology, despite being the products of different genes. They are synthesized as large precursor proteins by many cell types of both the peripheral and central immune system, including lymphocytes and monocytes. Pro-IL-1α is biologically active and is cleaved by CALPAIN to generate the smaller mature protein¹. Both forms of IL-1α remain mostly intracellular, unless released by cell death. By contrast, pro-IL-1β is biologically inactive and requires cleavage by CASPASE-1 to produce an active 17 kDa protein, which is secreted by a non-classical pathway that has not yet been completely defined³.

IL-1α and IL-1β exert similar biological effects, by binding the membrane-bound type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), which then associates with the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAcP) to form a complex that allows intracellular signalling⁴,⁵. There is also a type II IL-1 receptor (IL-1R2); however, it lacks an intracellular-signalling domain, so no downstream signal is initiated when IL-1 binds. IL-1R2 therefore

the IL-1 receptor and Toll-like receptor (TLR) superfamily, which has a crucial role in the innate immune response¹⁰. Family members are characterized by the presence of an intracellular TOLL/IL-1 RECEPTOR (TIR) DOMAIN, which triggers a complex series of signalling events in the target cell that results in activation of the transcription factor nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and the stress-related mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). This leads to the transcription of multiple inflammation-associated genes, which include genes encoding the following: chemokines, such as CXC-chemokine ligand 8 (CXCL8; also known as IL-8) and CX₃C-chemokine ligand 1 (CX₃CL1; also known as fractalkine); cytokines, such as IL-6 and tumour-necrosis factor (TNF); and adhesion molecules, such as endothelial-cell selectin (E-selectin) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1)⁶.

Sequencing of the human genome led to the discovery of genes that encode six additional putative ligand members of the IL-1 family (with amino-acid sequence similarity of 20–52% with IL-1α and/or IL-1β and IL-1RA) and several receptors belonging to the IL-1 receptor and TLR superfamily that potentially bind ligands in the IL-1 family. This led to the adoption of new nomenclature¹¹,¹² (TABLE 1). The new ligands are known as IL-1F5 (IL-1 family, member 5), IL-1F6, IL-1F7, IL-1F8, IL-1F9 and IL-1F10, but the ligands that were identified earlier are still usually referred to by their original names: IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-1RA and IL-18.

functions as a DECOY RECEPTOR⁶. All three receptor molecules, IL-1R1, IL-1R2 and IL-1RAcP, can be shed from the cell membrane and therefore exist in soluble forms, sIL-1R1, sIL-1R2 and sIL-1RAcP, respectively. Although most studies indicate that sIL-1R1 functions as a decoy receptor, it has been proposed that signal transduction could be initiated if membrane-bound IL-1 were to bind sIL-1R1 and the subsequent association with IL-1RAcP occurred. sIL-1R2 and sIL-1RAcP both function as inhibitors of IL-1-mediated signal transduction, by sequestering pro-IL-1β and IL-1R1, respectively. Furthermore, sIL-1R2 can associate with IL-1RAcP, thereby preventing the formation of an IL-1–IL-1R1–IL-1RAcP tri-molecular signalling complex⁶. The existence of these multiple regulatory mechanisms for IL-1 indicates the potential biological importance of this molecule.

The IL-1 family is unusual in that the third ligand member that was discovered is a naturally occurring competitive IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RA)⁷. IL-1RA is produced by the same cells that express IL-1, and there are three intracellular isoforms (icIL-1RA1, icIL-1RA2 and icIL-1RA3) and one secreted isoform (sIL-1RA). The secreted isoform functions as a competitive antagonist that binds IL-1R1 but does not trigger signal transduction, whereas the intracellular isoforms have poorly defined roles at present⁸.

After IL-1α and IL-1β, the next agonist member of the IL-1 family that was discovered was originally identified to be interferon-γ-inducing factor and then was subsequently named IL-18. IL-18 has many properties that are similar to IL-1β in that it is synthesized as an inactive pro-form that requires cleavage by caspase-1 to produce the mature, biologically active protein⁹. IL-18 binds the IL-18 receptor (IL-18R; previously known as IL-1-receptor-related protein), which then forms a complex with IL-18RAcP to initiate downstream signalling. The IL-1 and IL-18 receptors belong to

ASTROCYTE  
A type of glial cell that is found in vertebrate brain and is named for its characteristic star-like shape. These cells provide both mechanical and metabolic support for neurons, thereby regulating the environment in which neurons function.

ACUTE-PHASE PROTEIN  
One of the group of proteins that are secreted into the blood in increased or decreased quantities by hepatocytes in response to trauma, inflammation or disease. These proteins can be inhibitors or mediators of inflammatory processes.

EICOSANOID  
A fatty-acid derivative. These molecules are mainly derived from arachidonic-acid precursors and have a wide variety of biological activities. There are four main classes of eicosanoid: prostaglandins, prostacyclins, thromboxanes and leukotrienes. They are derived from the activities of cyclooxygenases and lipoxygenases on membrane-associated fatty-acid precursors.

Regulation of IL-1 production and activity  
All members of the IL-1 family are constitutively expressed in the brain at low or undetectable concentrations (at the level of both mRNA and protein)¹³. There are multiple levels of regulation of IL-1 production and activity, including transcription, translation, cleavage (which in the case of IL-1β is required for biological activity) and cellular release¹⁴ (FIG. 2). A diverse range of stimuli can affect these processes and lead to changes in IL-1 expression at the mRNA and/or protein level. Although many of these processes are best described in the periphery, there is no reason to assume that the same processes do not occur in the CNS, particularly because the relevant regulatory molecules are expressed there.

Transcriptional regulation. Expression of the genes that encode IL-1α and IL-1β is induced by various pro-inflammatory stimuli (including bacterial and viral products), other cytokines (notably TNF), and cellular injury and hypoxia¹⁵,¹⁶. These observations have been made mainly during experiments with peripheral cells (mostly macrophages), but given that microglial cells and macrophages have a common monocyctic progenitor, these findings are probably relevant to the CNS. The promoter region of the gene that encodes IL-1β is characterized by the presence of a TATA box (which is a characteristic of inducible genes), to which the first transcription factor in the transcription process (TATA-binding protein) binds, and a CAAT box, which controls the efficiency

CALPAIN  
One of a group of calcium-  
activated cytoplasmic proteases  
that are found in many tissues  
and that hydrolyse various  
endogenous proteins, including  
neuropeptides and cytoskeletal  
proteins, as well as proteins  
from smooth muscle, cardiac  
muscle, liver, platelets and  
erythrocytes. Two subclasses  
are known: one with high  
calcium sensitivity, and one  
with low calcium sensitivity.

CASPACE  
One of a group of enzymes  
that have a role in promoting  
apoptosis (that is, programmed  
cell death). Inhibition of such  
enzymes might be useful for  
combating cell and tissue  
damage in conditions such as  
myocardial infarction, stroke,  
inflammatory diseases and  
neurodegenerative disease.  
Augmentation of such enzymes,  
through the production of  
pro-apoptotic proteins, might  
be useful for combating  
proliferative conditions, such  
as cancer.

ligand and thereby prevent  
the ligand from associating  
with the conventional signalling  
receptor.

TOLL/IL-1 RECEPTOR DOMAIN  
(Toll/interleukin-1-receptor  
domain; TIR domain). An  
intracellular-signalling domain  
that is found in IL-1 receptors,  
Toll-like receptors and several  
adaptor proteins, including  
MyD88 (myeloid differentiation  
primary-response protein 88).

of the promoter for initiating transcription. There are  
also several binding regions for tissue-specific factors,  
including nuclear factor-βA (NF-βA) and SP1, and these  
determine cell-type-specific expression. Transcription of  
the genes that encode IL-1 is also affected by numerous  
factors that recognize and bind DNA regulatory sites,  
such as the cyclic AMP response element, the activa-  
tor protein 1 (AP1)- and NF-κB-binding site, and the  
lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-response enhancer site¹⁴. As  
well as these, several other signals (both intracellular  
and extracellular) can function to increase the rate of  
transcription of the gene encoding IL-1β, including  
complement components and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂).  
However, perhaps most relevant to CNS injury are the  
β-chain of the S100 calcium-binding protein (S100B;  
also known as neurite extension factor), β-amyloid  
(which is present in plaques in Alzheimer’s disease)  
and excitotoxins (excitatory amino-acid-receptor  
agonists), all of which clearly have prominent roles  
in the brain¹⁷,¹⁸. Other factors function to inhibit  
the transcription of genes encoding IL-1, including  
glucocorticoids and their anti-inflammatory media-  
tor annexin-1 (also known as lipocortin-1), which is  
neuroprotective against ISCHAEMIC INJURY¹⁹.


Post-transcriptional and translational regulation.  
Production of the inactive pro-IL-1β protein can be  
regulated in several ways (both positively and nega-  
tively), and in many situations, this is dissociated from  
changes in expression of mRNA encoding IL-1β¹⁴. For  
example, LPS can increase IL-1β protein production  
through increasing mRNA stability²⁰. Translation can  
also be increased by epidermal growth factor, cortico-  
tropin-releasing hormone and ICAM1, whereas  
translation is inhibited by dexamethasone (a synthetic  
glucocorticoid)¹⁴.


Post-translational and cellular-release regulation.  
Cellular release of IL-1β seems to require two  
stimuli²¹,²². For example, treatment of macrophages  
or microglial cells with LPS induces expression of  
pro-IL-1β but not cleavage or release. Subsequent  
activation of P2X7 — a purinergic receptor and  
ligand-gated ion channel — by ATP (or ADP), in LPS-  
primed macrophages, elicits both cleavage of mature  
IL-1β through a caspase-1-dependent process and its  
subsequent release²³. This process of IL-1β release  
depends on the release of calcium from intracellular  
stores and on the activation of phospholipase C and  
phospholipase A₂ (REFS 24,25).  

As well as ATP, other stimuli can also provide the  
second signal that leads to IL-1β cleavage and release,  
and these stimuli have in common the ability to pro-  
duce marked changes in the ionic composition of the  
cell that is releasing IL-1β. Consistent with this, acti-  
vation of the receptor P2X7 leads to potassium efflux  
and therefore to a decline in intracellular potassium  
concentration, which seems to be essential for the  
activation of caspase-1 (REFS 22,26,27). However, there  
has been much debate about the physiological rel-  
evance of ATP as a regulator of IL-1β release, because  
ATP, and other release-inducing stimuli, result in  
death of the IL-1β-producing cell. Recent work has  
identified LL37 (also known as CAMP) — an anti-  
microbial peptide — to be an inducer of IL-1β release  
through activation of P2X7 (REF. 28). By contrast, a  
novel family of cytokine-release inhibitory drugs  
(CRIDs) block IL-1β release in response to diverse  
stimuli (that is, LPS and ATP, hypotonic stress, and  
cytotoxic T lymphocytes), but they do not function  
through P2X7 (REF. 29). One of the main targets of  
CRIDs is the enzyme glutathione S-transferase-ω1-1  
(GSTO1), which might be a crucial regulator of

Figure 2 | Regulation of interleukin-1β production and action. A diagram illustrating the regulation of expression of the gene encoding interleukin-1β (IL-1β), the cellular release of IL-1β and its biological activity is shown. Factors that increase the transcription of the gene encoding IL-1β include lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and prostaglandin E₂ (PGE₂), whereas glucocorticoids have been shown to inhibit transcription. Factors that increase the translation of mRNA encoding IL-1β include epidermal growth factor (EGF), corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) and intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM1). IL-1β is synthesized as an inactive precursor protein (known as pro-IL-1β). Caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1β to generate the biologically active form of the cytokine. As a result of this dependence on caspase-1, regulation of IL-1β activity is also influenced by regulation of caspase-1 expression and activity. The activity of caspase-1 is mainly regulated by stimuli that can produce marked changes in the ionic composition of the IL-1β-releasing cell: for example, calcium ionophores (such as A23187 and ATP). Calcium ionophores increase potassium efflux through the purinergic ligand-gated ion channel P2X7, which leads to the cleavage of pro-caspase-1 into the active form of the enzyme. Cellular release of the mature biologically active form of IL-1β occurs through a non-classical pathway that has not yet been completely defined, although several mechanisms have been proposed (including lysis of the cell, the rapid shedding of microvesicles from the cell or the exocytosis of secretory lysosomes). Many factors have been shown to affect the release of mature IL-1β: pro-inflammatory agents (such as LPS, PGE₂, nitric oxide (NO) and IL-1 itself) are usually stimulatory, whereas anti-inflammatory agents (such as glucocorticoids and IL-4) tend to be inhibitory. After it has been released, the biological effects of IL-1β are tightly controlled by inhibitory members of the IL-1 family, which include the following: the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA); and several soluble receptors, soluble type I IL-1 receptor (sIL-1R1), soluble type II IL-1 receptor (sIL-1R2) and soluble IL-1-receptor accessory protein (sIL-1RAcP).

Biological-activity regulation. After IL-1β is released, there is tight regulation of its biological effects (as discussed previously), by inhibitory molecules such as IL-1RA, sIL-1R1, sIL-1R2 and sIL-1RAcP (FIG. 2).

IL-1 actions influence systemic functions  
IL-1 has diverse actions in the CNS on numerous cell types. These can be categorized as actions that influence the local environment in the brain and as actions that modify systemic functions. The effects of IL-1 on GLIAL CELLS, neurons and endothelial cells, and on immune cells that invade the brain during injury, markedly contribute to local inflammation (discussed later). There is controversy about the contribution of IL-1 to ‘physiological’ responses in the CNS in the absence of disease or injury, but it has been reported to contribute to LONG-TERM POTENTIATION³².

IL-1 that is produced during CNS inflammation or injury not only influences the local environment (discussed later) but also has local effects that influence systemic functions, including effects on appetite, SLOW-WAVE SLEEP, body temperature, neuroendocrine function and peripheral immune function (BOX 1). Many of these contribute to systemic host defence against diseases of the peripheral nervous system, as well as the CNS; host-defence responses include ‘sickness behaviour’, fever and the acute-phase response³³. These responses are mediated by the effects of IL-1 on neuronal output (for example, through the sympathetic nervous system) and on hormonal influences, mainly through stimulation of the release of corticotropin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, which leads to activation of the HYPOTHALAMIC-PITUITARY-ADRENAL (HPA) AXIS³⁴.

There are no data about how the new ligands in the IL-1 family function in any body system, under physiological conditions or pathological conditions, although some are known to be expressed at the mRNA level in the normal brain³⁵. IL-1F9 has

been reported to induce NF-κB expression in Jurkat T cells that are transfected with IL-1-receptor-related protein 2, an orphan member of the IL-1-receptor family that is highly expressed in the brain ${ }^{36,37}$. However, despite the constitutive expression of IL-1-receptor-related protein 2 by glial cells, IL-1F9 fails to induce the classical IL-1-mediated signalling pathway, including activation of NF-κB, in these cells ${ }^{38}$. Similarly, IL-1F8 is expressed by neurons and glial cells, but it does not induce IL-1-mediated signalling ${ }^{39}$.

**Evidence for IL-1 involvement in neuronal injury**

*Expression of IL-1.* The expression of both IL-1α and IL-1β is upregulated within minutes (that is, rapidly) at the mRNA level and within hours at the protein level in response to experimentally induced NEUROTOXIC STIMULI. Early expression occurs in cells of the monocyte and macrophage lineage, whereas later expression is seen in astrocytes — although all endogenous brain cells (that is, glial cells, neurons and vascular endothelial cells) can express IL-1 (REF. 35). Invading immune cells might also contribute to the delayed expression of IL-1 and to the development of neuronal injury ${ }^{40}$. IL-1RA expression is also upregulated (at both the mRNA and protein levels) after neuronal injury, but expression is delayed compared with that of the agonists in the IL-1 family ${ }^{41}$.

*Administration of exogenous IL-1.* Although a recent study shows that administration of exogenous IL-1 to the rat brain can induce the loss of dopamine-producing neurons, most studies report that direct administration of IL-1 alone to healthy neuronal cells or to the brains of normal animals fails to cause detectable injury ${ }^{42,43}$. By contrast, co-administration of IL-1 with other cytokines can result in synergistic effects that lead to a greater degree of neurotoxicity being observed ${ }^{44-46}$. Furthermore, administration of IL-1 to the brains of animals in which injury has

been induced by TRAUMATIC, ischaemic or EXCITOTOXIC stimuli markedly increases the ensuing damage ${ }^{43,47}$. However, the results obtained in these injury studies might reflect effects of exogenous IL-1, albeit at low concentrations, that do not accurately represent the effects of the endogenous ligand.

**Inhibition of endogenous IL-1.** The most compelling evidence implicating endogenous IL-1 in experimentally induced neuronal injury is from studies in which the expression, release or effects of IL-1 have been inhibited. For this purpose, scientists have been blessed by a ‘dream tool’ in IL-1RA ${ }^{7}$. Indeed, it was experiments using IL-1RA that first showed marked protection against the neuronal injury that usually results from focal cerebral ischaemia (induced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery) and against the injury elicited by intracerebral administration of toxic doses of excitotoxins, such as N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA), in rodents ${ }^{48}$. IL-1RA has been used extensively in subsequent experiments to clarify the role of IL-1 in neuronal injury. In rats, mice and gerbils, administration of exogenous IL-1RA or overexpression of endogenous IL-1RA markedly inhibits neuronal injury induced by various forms of cerebral ischaemia (such as focal, global, temporary or permanent ischaemia), as well as by excitotoxins or trauma ${ }^{49}$. In addition, IL-1RA limits epileptic seizures in rodents and brain injury induced by heat stroke in rabbits ${ }^{50,51}$. These effects of IL-1RA on such diverse experimental systems indicate a fundamental role for IL-1 in neuronal injury. This conclusion heavily relies on the specificity of IL-1RA; however, the only reported action of IL-1RA is competitive inhibition of the effects of IL-1 (through preventing the formation of IL-1R1–IL-1RAcP signalling complexes), except for a single report claiming that IL-1RA has agonist activity in the hippocampus ${ }^{52}$. Although IL-1RA has been shown to produce biological effects when administered alone, these result from inhibiting the actions of endogenous IL-1 rather than from a direct agonist effect of IL-1RA itself ${ }^{32}$.

Several additional pieces of data support the findings from these experiments with IL-1RA. INTRACEREBROVENTRICULAR administration of an antibody that neutralizes IL-1β, or inhibition of the cleavage and release of IL-1β by deletion of the gene encoding caspase-1 or inhibition of caspase-1 activity, attenuates ischaemic brain damage ${ }^{47,53}$. Perhaps most importantly, deletion of the genes encoding both IL-1α and IL-1β markedly reduces ischaemic brain damage in mice ${ }^{54}$. Interestingly, deletion of either gene alone is ineffective, perhaps because of compensatory effects, whereas deletion of the gene encoding IL-1RA increases ischaemic brain damage, indicating that endogenous IL-1RA has an important neuroprotective effect ${ }^{54,55}$. This is further supported by experiments using a neutralizing antibody specific for IL-1RA: administration to rats undergoing occlusion of the middle cerebral artery induced a marked increase in the resultant neuronal injury ${ }^{41}$.

**Box 1 | Physiological functions of interleukin-1**

Constitutive expression of interleukin-1 (IL-1) occurs at very low levels in the ‘normal’ brain, so it has generally been thought that IL-1 contributes little to physiological function. However, a recent review directly addressed this issue and raised the possibility that, in contrast to the current dogma, IL-1 has a direct role in some physiological processes, including sleep and synaptic plasticity ${ }^{13}$. Evidence of a role for IL-1 in the regulation of sleep was initially derived from studies in which spontaneous sleep was reduced through the inhibition of the effects of IL-1, using specific antibodies or the IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RA), as well as from the observation that the concentration of IL-1 is higher in the brain during sleep ${ }^{97}$. The involvement of IL-1 in synaptic plasticity was proposed on the basis that increased expression of IL-1 is seen after the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, together with the finding that IL-1RA can impair established LTP ${ }^{32}$. The use of transgenic and gene-knockout mice, which allow the study of phenotype changes induced by genetic manipulation, has provided the opportunity to further clarify the physiological role of IL-1-family members. Mice that are deficient in the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1), which is the signalling receptor for IL-1, have been shown to experience considerably less sleep than control animals, to have deficits in synaptic plasticity and to have impaired performance of a spatial memory task ${ }^{98,99}$.

In vitro versus in vivo findings. Substantial evidence from many in vivo experimental settings therefore indicates that endogenous IL-1 is an important mediator of neuronal injury. To fully elucidate the mechanisms of action that are associated with these in vivo observations, there have been attempts to establish the role of IL-1 in cell death in vitro; however, this has proved difficult and has yielded several contradictory findings. Indeed, studies of primary cultures of cortical neurons reveal that IL-1 does not increase excitotoxic damage but, instead, is neuroprotective through inducing the expression of nerve growth factor, whereas IL-1RA, in contrast to its in vivo actions, is not neuroprotective against this insult<sup>56,57</sup>. Conversely, in primary cultures of hippocampal neurons, IL-1 exacerbates NMDA-induced excitotoxic cell death, although this was observed after treatment with doses at least 500-fold lower than those that were previously observed to be protective<sup>58</sup>. In the latter study, slight protective effects were observed after administration of higher doses of IL-1, indicating that its effects on neuronal injury can be distinct at different doses; however, it is difficult to relate exogenous doses of IL-1 to endogenous levels of IL-1 during injury because of the potent effects of IL-1 and the localized nature of its actions. It is also probable that the effects of IL-1 are time dependent, because the two studies showing protective actions involved a 24-hour incubation in the presence of IL-1, whereas enhanced injury was seen when cells were exposed to IL-1 for only a few minutes<sup>56–58</sup>. This hypothesis is supported by studies of ORGANOTYPIC SLICE CULTURES: in these studies, both protective and toxic effects of IL-1 were observed, and the differences between these were associated with the dose of IL-1 and the type of injury<sup>59</sup>.

Despite reports to the contrary, most data indicate that IL-1 is a crucial contributor to neuronal injury, so understanding which mechanisms are involved and how IL-1 activity can be regulated is an area of intense research.

Mechanisms of IL-1 action in CNS injury

The mechanisms that underlie the effects of IL-1 in neuronal injury are not known, but several putative pathways have been identified. The elucidation of these mechanisms has proved challenging for two reasons: first, the diversity of effects of IL-1 in the brain; and second, the difficulties in mimicking the effects that have been observed in vivo in cellular systems.

is also a potent pyrogen) protects against, rather than exacerbates, ischaemic brain damage in rats<sup>49</sup>. Nevertheless, IL-1 might selectively influence brain temperature globally or regionally, which could, in turn, influence neuronal injury, although preliminary data using magnetic resonance imaging of rodents indicates that this is not the case (A. Parry-Jones, unpublished observations).

The severity of ischaemic injury is acutely sensitive to changes in cerebral blood flow to the affected region, and several reports show that IL-1 can affect this, although other findings are contradictory. Under normal conditions, IL-1 has been reported to increase blood flow, whereas in a model of global hypoperfusion, IL-1 was seen to decrease cerebral blood flow, and IL-1RA to increase cerebral blood flow<sup>62,63</sup>. These differences might reflect physiological versus pathological roles of IL-1 that depend on the level of expression, or they might reflect the experimental model used; therefore, this requires further investigation. It is important to note, however, that converse effects of low and high doses of IL-1 are seen in many situations.

IL-1 is also known to affect neuroendocrine responses and the activity of the HPA axis, which can considerably influence the outcome after a stroke<sup>64</sup>. So, it is possible that this is another contributing factor to the actions of IL-1 on neuronal injury.

Transmitting IL-1 signals in the CNS. Most reports of the effects of IL-1 involve glial cells, including astrocytes and OLIGODENDROCYTES, but IL-1 also affects neurons, endothelial cells and invading immune cells (FIG. 3). All of these cell types express the IL-1 signalling receptor, IL-1R1. In culture, treatment of these cells with recombinant IL-1 usually results in strong activation of the classical IL-1-mediated signalling pathways: that is, activation of MAPKs and NF-κB, and release of secondary pro-inflammatory mediators (such as PGE₂, IL-6 and nitric oxide). However, a recent study shows that there is cell-type-specific IL-1-mediated signalling: the signalling pathway involving p38MAPK is activated in neurons, whereas NF-κB is activated in astrocytes<sup>65</sup>.

Some studies have questioned the role of IL-1R1 in mediating the actions of IL-1 and IL-1RA in neuronal injury. In vitro, it has been reported that IL-1RA can exert agonist activity through binding a different receptor (not IL-1R1)<sup>52</sup>. Mice that lack IL-1R1 show ischaemic brain damage that is almost identical to that of wild-type animals, although a recent study using a less severe ischaemic insult showed a reduction in injury in these IL-1R1-deficient animals<sup>66,67</sup>. However, more importantly, IL-1 exacerbates ischaemic brain damage to the same extent in IL-1R1-deficient mice and wild-type mice<sup>66</sup>. This supports the idea that there are additional IL-1 receptors through which IL-1 increases neuronal injury. Moreover, in vitro studies have indicated that the effects of IL-1β that occur independently of IL-1R1 in vivo are not mediated by classical IL-1-mediated signalling pathways<sup>68</sup>. These observations indicate that there are IL-1R1-dependent and -independent signalling pathways, which have

Physiological factors affected by injury. Increased body temperature markedly exacerbates experimentally induced neuronal injury and is associated with poor clinical outcome for individuals who have had a stroke or have a brain injury<sup>60,61</sup>. Experimental data indicate that the effects of IL-1 on core temperature (as determined by rectal temperature) are not the main contributors to neuronal injury. In rodents, IL-1 can exacerbate, and IL-1RA can inhibit, neuronal damage without inducing marked changes in core temperature. Conversely, antipyretics inhibit increases in core temperature but not neuronal injury, and IL-6 (which

separate roles in different processes. It is interesting to speculate that the IL-1R1-independent pathway might be utilized only when neurons are under threat, as occurs during ischaemia.

**Effects of IL-1 on neurons.** Although the direct effects of IL-1 on neuronal function can contribute to neuronal injury, there are conflicting reports about the nature of these effects. Most data are derived from *in vitro* studies and show that IL-1 has effects that could be expected to reduce neuronal-cell death, such as inhibition of glutamate release, inhibition of calcium entry, inhibition of long-term potentiation and enhancement of synaptic inhibition by γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)⁶⁹. However, this IL-1-induced increase in synaptic inhibition could lead to an overall increase in excitation and cell death if the affected inhibitory neuron synapses on another inhibitory neuron, leading to disinhibition of an excitatory pathway. IL-1 also exerts other effects that could contribute to neuronal injury, including increasing the entry of calcium through the NMDA-receptor ion channel, which is strongly implicated in cell death⁵⁸. IL-1 is also a potent regulator of seizure activity and has been shown to increase the time spent in chemically induced seizures, whereas IL-1RA is an anticonvulsant⁵⁰,⁷⁰. Increases in seizure activity are frequently associated with brain damage, and they might reflect another means by which IL-1 can exacerbate injury.

**Effects of IL-1 on glial cells.** IL-1 has numerous effects on glial cells, most of which seem to be mediated through IL-1R1. Of all glial cells, IL-1 affects astrocytes the most, and it promotes their proliferation, a process known as astrogliosis. The functional role of astrogliosis in neuronal injury is complex, because reactive astrocytes can support neurons by regulating ion and transmitter concentrations and thereby modifying electrical transmission while also being an important source of pro-inflammatory, and therefore potentially neurotoxic, molecules⁷¹. Indeed, data from DNA-microarray studies show that treatment of primary astrocyte cultures with IL-1 can change the expression of almost 1,400 genes, including induction of expression of genes encoding chemokines, growth factors (such as nerve growth factor), adhesion molecules, MATRIX METALLOPROTEINASES (MMPs) and cytokines (such as IL-6) that bind receptors containing gp130 (glycoprotein 130; a common receptor subunit)⁷². So, a vast range of mediators can be expressed, many of which have the potential to be neurotoxic. By contrast, others can promote neuronal survival and have a role in repair and recovery processes after injury. Ultimately, the overall consequence of the exposure of astrocytes to IL-1 depends mostly on the balance between, and the temporal expression profile of, the survival-promoting molecules and the neurotoxic molecules.

IL-1 can directly bind rat microglial cells, which results in induction of expression and release of several mediators, most of which are neurotoxic, including reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, eicosanoids (such as PGE₂), pro-inflammatory cytokines (such as TNF) and chemokines (such as CC-chemokine ligand 2, CCL2; also known as MCP1)⁷³. However, similar to astrocytes, microglial cells can also produce anti-inflammatory molecules, which are potentially beneficial⁷⁴. Interestingly, there might be species-specific differences in IL-1R1 expression and/or IL-1-mediated signalling by microglial cells: it has been reported that IL-1R1 expression is very low and that IL-1 fails to induce any of the classical signalling cascades in mouse microglial cells in culture, which is in contrast to the responses observed for rats⁷⁵.

Oligodendrocytes express IL-1 receptors and can produce IL-1, but little is known about the effects of IL-1 on these cells. A recent study showed that IL-1 could promote the differentiation of oligodendrocyte progenitors and could aid the maturation and survival of the differentiated cells⁷⁶. Such a role indicates that IL-1 might affect MYELINATION processes; indeed, IL-1β-deficient mice show a delay in remyelination, which is indicative of a role in some repair processes in the CNS⁷⁷.

Figure 3 | **Summary of proposed cellular actions of interleukin-1β in neuronal injury.** There is evidence indicating that all cell types in the brain, as well as invading leukocytes, can express and release interleukin-1β (IL-1β), either under normal conditions or in response to neuronal injury. In addition, the receptor that transduces IL-1β-mediated signals — the type I IL-1 receptor (IL-1R1) — is also expressed at the surface of these cells, thereby enabling them to respond to IL-1β in an autocrine manner, as well as a paracrine manner, after neuronal injury. After IL-1β has bound IL-1R1, these different cells can produce a wide range of pro-inflammatory and immunoregulatory mediators that can contribute to neuronal-cell death or promote neuronal-cell survival.

INTRATHECAL  
The administration of substances into the thin space between the lining of the spinal cord and the brain. This space contains cerebrospinal fluid.

**Effects of IL-1 on endothelial cells.** There is increasing evidence that the brain endothelium is important in a diverse range of neurodegenerative disorders, which includes stroke, as well as in more chronic conditions, such as vascular dementia. In addition to their main function in formation of the blood–brain barrier (BBB), cerebral endothelial cells express functional IL-1 receptors and could therefore be an important site at which IL-1 could operate in neuronal injury<sup>78</sup>. IL-1 has been shown to exert several effects on the brain vasculature, including increased expression of molecules that are involved in leukocyte recruitment (such as CCL2), increased expression of adhesion molecules (such as ICAM1) and, in some cases, breakdown of the BBB, leading to the invasion of monocytes and neutrophils into the brain parenchyma<sup>79,80</sup>. Intracerebral IL-1β can, however, induce expression of E-selectin and P-selectin (platelet selectin) in the absence of BBB breakdown. This is seen 3–4 hours after injection of IL-1β, with the selectins being present at the surface of activated, but not resting, endothelium. Using selective neutralizing antibodies, it has been shown that it is the expression of P-selectin, and not E-selectin, that leads to the delayed recruitment of neutrophils<sup>80</sup>. The invasion of leukocytes into the brain parenchyma that is induced by IL-1 depends on IL-1R1 and might subsequently lead to neuronal-cell death through the release of various neurotoxic mediators, such as nitric oxide, eicosanoids and IL-1 itself<sup>40</sup>. Intracerebral IL-1 also increases the expression of CXC-chemokines, such as CXCL1 (also known as CINC1), which can contribute to the passage of leukocytes from the circulation to the brain parenchyma<sup>81</sup>.

As well as having an important role in leukocyte recruitment, brain endothelial cells can actively produce many of the same neurotoxic factors that are produced by glial cells after exposure to IL-1, including prostaglandins, nitric oxide and MMPs.

From the evidence that is presented here, it is clear that it has been extremely difficult to identify the precise mechanisms of action of IL-1 in acute neurological injury. This is mainly a result of the diverse range of effects of IL-1 in different experimental systems, some of which are opposing. Therefore, it is important to be aware of the conditions under which such experiments are carried out, because these conditions might not accurately reflect the *in vivo* situation, in which the outcome depends on the combination of several effects on different cell types.

**Evidence for IL-1 role in neurological disease**

IL-1 is implicated in the pathogenesis of several neurological diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, traumatic brain injury, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease and stroke (TABLE 2). For these cases, the evidence is not as extensive as for the experimental models of neuronal injury that have been described. Evidence of a role for IL-1 is mainly based on increased expression of IL-1 in brains (assessed post-mortem) and/or increased concentrations of IL-1 in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from patients with these diseases. However, there is also evidence to indicate that polymorphisms in genes that encode IL-1-family members might be associated with some of these neurodegenerative conditions, including stroke (BOX 2).

**IL-1 in clinical stroke.** In patients who have suffered a stroke, cytokines can usually be studied only in the plasma or the lumbar CSF. One small study showed an increase in IL-1β concentration in individuals after a stroke compared with healthy individuals, although this was not observed in earlier studies<sup>82–84</sup>. Intrathecal production of IL-1β might occur<sup>84</sup>, and an increase in the level of mRNA encoding IL-1β in blood mononuclear cells shows a modest correlation with a worse neurological outcome<sup>85</sup>. Plasma concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-6 and acute-phase proteins are increased within 2–4 days of an ischaemic stroke, and higher concentrations are observed in patients with larger infarcts<sup>86</sup>, which indicates that the magnitude of the inflammatory response is associated with the

Box 2 | Polymorphisms in interleukin-1-family genes

Genes of the interleukin-1 (IL-1) family are located in a 10.9-megabase cluster on chromosome 2. The genes that encode IL-1α (that is, the IL-1A gene), IL-1β (IL-1B) and the IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RA; IL-1RN) are located in close proximity on chromosome 2p14–q21. These genes are highly polymorphic, containing both single nucleotide substitutions and length variants, and there is evidence indicating that polymorphic variants are associated with various diseases. Variations in phenotype are thought to arise from these polymorphisms, which might explain the interindividual variation that is observed in the stimulated production of IL-1 and IL-1RA<sup>100</sup>. Furthermore, carrying certain polymorphisms has been proposed as a risk factor for developing disease.

Individuals who carry the IL-1RN*2 allele (in which intron 2 differs from that of other alleles) have altered production of IL-1RA and IL-1β, and this allele is also associated with angiographic coronary artery disease and carotid artery disease<sup>101,102</sup>. The endothelium of patients who carry the IL-1RN*2 allele might be more vulnerable to inflammation induced by IL-1 because these cells lack intrinsic anti-inflammatory activity. The IL-1A –889 T/T genotype (in which both alleles have a thymidine nucleotide at position –889 and are referred to as T alleles) is associated with increased IL-1α production by monocytes, and an increased frequency of this T allele is found in patients with cerebral infarction compared with healthy control individuals<sup>103,104</sup>. Carrying the IL-1RN*1 allele has been postulated to be a risk factor for ischaemic stroke<sup>105,106</sup>. Comparison of healthy control individuals with a group of young patients who had myocardial infarcts and had suffered a stroke showed that the IL-1β –511 T/T genotype reduced the risk of premature myocardial infarction and stroke<sup>107</sup>. Environmental factors, such as smoking, might also influence plasma concentrations of IL-1RA<sup>108</sup>. On the basis of these studies, gene therapy is a potential treatment for ischaemia<sup>109</sup>.

SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE  
An acute condition in which there is bleeding into the space between the meningeal layers (that is, the arachnoid membrane and the pia mater), which are adjacent to the brain.

MICRODIALYSIS  
A technique for measuring the extracellular concentrations of substances in tissues, usually *in vivo*, using a small probe that is equipped with a semipermeable membrane. Substances can also be introduced into the extracellular fluid through the membrane of the probe.

PHASE IIa TRIAL  
A pilot clinical trial to evaluate efficacy and safety in a relatively small number of patients who have the disease or condition to be treated, diagnosed or prevented. Such studies often involve hospitalized patients, because they can be closely monitored. The trial objectives might focus on dose–response, type of patient, frequency of dosing or several other issues that are involved in safety and efficacy.

Measures of a person’s daily functioning and, more specifically, the ability to carry out the activities of daily living and the extent of mobility (Barthel Index) or disability (Modified Rankin Scale).

extent of the neuronal injury. The balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory mediators is probably a crucial determinant of neuronal injury and neurological outcome, and measurement of the expression of these molecules at earlier time points in patients who have suffered a clinical stroke is desirable to further test this hypothesis.

SUBARACHNOID HAEMORRHAGE (SAH) has a mortality rate of three to five individuals in every ten. Of those who survive the initial bleed and any re-onset of bleeding, the main cause of mortality is delayed cerebral ischaemia (DCI). Interestingly, there is evidence of an association between the cytokine response to SAH and the subsequent development of DCI. After aneurysmal SAH, increased concentrations of IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF in the CSF have been shown; peak concentrations were observed 5–9 days after SAH, corresponding to the usual time-course of DCI<sup>87</sup>. Increased concentrations of both IL-1RA and TNF have also been associated with poor clinical outcome<sup>88</sup>. Determining the exact relationship between the cytokine response and DCI requires studies that are more systematic, and MICRODIALYSIS might be a more fruitful method for obtaining data on central inflammation in patients with SAH.

Therapeutic targeting of IL-1 in CNS disease. CNS diseases that are associated with neuronal injury — which include stroke, head injury and birth asphyxia, as well as chronic disorders, such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease — are leading causes of morbidity and mortality. Yet the search for effective treatments has met with little success, and more than 100 trials of neuroprotective agents for the treatment of stroke have failed. This is probably a consequence of multiple factors, including the limitations of preclinical data, the difficulty in optimizing clinical design and the diversity of the condition<sup>89</sup>. It might also be a consequence, in part, of the fact that many interventions have targeted physiologically important processes that are disrupted in disease. By contrast, inflammation and IL-1 production are processes that are mainly, or exclusively, confined to disease. So, inhibition of IL-1 might have advantages as a therapeutic approach.

Administration of recombinant human IL-1RA has not resulted in any marked adverse effects in preclinical studies. It is licensed for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (using subcutaneous injection)<sup>90</sup>, and it has also shown no adverse-event profiles in patients with severe sepsis<sup>91,92</sup>. The apparent lack of toxicity of recombinant human IL-1RA in other disease states, and its efficacy in several experimental models of stroke, makes it an attractive compound to study for the treatment of acute stroke. Data collected from preliminary Phase II clinical trials can be used to assess safety and biological activity in humans before any large clinical studies are carried out, with the clinical data collected as a secondary outcome to inform future studies<sup>93</sup>. We initiated a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled PHASE IIa TRIAL in which 17 patients were recruited within 6 hours of having an acute stroke and were treated with a loading dose of recombinant human IL-1RA, which was followed by intravenous infusion of the recombinant protein; these patients were then compared with 17 stroke patients who were treated with vehicle<sup>94</sup>. As well as obtaining safety data, plasma concentrations of IL-1RA, IL-6 and C-REACTIVE PROTEIN were measured. There were no safety concerns in the small number of patients who were treated. Total blood-cell and neutrophil counts were lower in the treated group, with similar trends in concentrations of C-reactive protein and IL-6, and qualitative analysis indicated that patients who were treated with IL-1RA had a better clinical outcome, as measured by standard clinical scales of ability and daily living (such as THE BARTHEL INDEX AND THE MODIFIED RANKIN SCALE).

Figure 4 | Therapeutic routes to targeting interleukin-1 in neurodegenerative disease. The various regulatory points in the interleukin-1 (IL-1) pathway that could be targeted with drugs to affect biological activity are shown. Examples of compounds or strategies that have been shown to be effective are also shown. These include inhibition of expression of the gene encoding IL-1β with anti-inflammatory molecules, such as annexin-1 or interleukin-10; this strategy is also neuroprotective¹⁰. Cannabinoids can also affect expression of the gene encoding IL-1β and can limit neuronal injury, and recent data indicate that their anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects depend on the induction of expression of the IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RA)¹¹. Caspase-1 is required for cleavage of inactive pro-IL-1β into the mature protein, and selective inhibitors of caspase-1 can protect against neuronal injury. Cytokine-release inhibitory drugs (CRIDs) prevent release of IL-1, but their influence on neuronal injury is not yet known. There are also various compounds that function as selective inhibitors of the signalling pathways that involve nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) or the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) p38MAPK and ERK (extracellular-signal-regulated kinase), which are downstream of IL-1-receptor engagement; in different experimental models, all of these compounds can reduce cell death. Similarly, selective inhibitors of nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2) have also been shown to be neuroprotective. At present, the only drug in clinical practice that inhibits IL-1-mediated signalling is anakinra (Kineret; Amgen Inc.), a recombinant form of IL-1RA.

clinical trial can be considered, further pharmacokinetic data on recombinant human IL-1RA in the plasma and the brain need to be obtained. IL-1RA is a large protein with a short half-life, so there might be limitations on its penetration of the BBB. An exploratory study in which recombinant human IL-1RA was administered by intravenous infusion to patients with SAH who had external ventricular drains *in situ* has shown that ~1% of the intravenous dose crosses into the CSF (S. Clark, unpublished observations). Intranasal delivery might allow more rapid access to the brain, whereas microdialysis measurements might provide a more accurate reflection of brain concentrations of the drug⁹⁵.

These findings, together with the proven safety of IL-1RA and its extensive use in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, indicate that IL-1RA should be considered as a potential therapeutic agonist for patients who have suffered a stroke or have other forms of neuronal injury.

### Concluding remarks

The extensive experimental evidence, together with the strong supporting clinical data, indicate that targeting the IL-1 system is a feasible and rational approach for the treatment of acute neurodegenerative disease, such as stroke, and possibly for the treatment of chronic disorders. Much effort has centred on IL-1RA, but whether IL-1RA proves efficacious remains to be seen. Biological responses in target cells are observed when IL-1 occupies only a few receptors, mainly because several pathways are activated in parallel. This means that most cells have an abundance of free receptors, and it leads to the requirement for large amounts of IL-1RA to successfully block receptor activation. Also, IL-1RA is a relatively large protein and thereby has limited brain access, although we have shown that, after intravenous administration of IL-1RA, the concentrations of IL-1RA in the CSF of patients with SAH are similar to, or greater than, those seen in rats in which neuroprotection is observed (S. Clark, unpublished observations). However, a better strategy might be to target the production and/or release of biologically active IL-1 receptor ligands or to selectively target downstream signalling events (FIG. 4). In both of these areas, the basic biology is mainly undefined for IL-1 in the CNS, and this should be the focus of research in the immediate future. Intriguingly, it might be that peripheral responses that are induced by increases in the central concentrations of IL-1 have a more prominent role in CNS disease than previously thought, as indicated by the early induction of an acute-phase response in the liver after focal brain injury⁹⁶. This is an exciting area to exploit, because it offers tremendous advantages with respect to drug therapy, there being no requirement for penetration of the BBB by the drug molecules.
