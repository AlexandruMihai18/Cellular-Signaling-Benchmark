### Abstract
An H₂O₂-dependent enzyme capable of coupling catharanthine and vindoline into α-3′,4′-anhydrovinblastine (AVLB) was purified to apparent homogeneity from *Catharanthus roseus* leaves. The enzyme shows a specific AVLB synthase activity of 1.8 nkat/mg, and a molecular weight of 45.40 kDa (SDS-PAGE). In addition to AVLB synthase activity, the purified enzyme shows peroxidase activity, and the VIS spectrum of the protein presents maxima at 404, 501 and 633 nm, indicating that it is a high spin ferric heme protein, belonging to the plant peroxidase superfamily. Kinetic studies revealed that both catharanthine and vindoline were substrates of the enzyme, AVLB being the major coupling product.

### 1. Introduction

α-3′,4′-Anhydrovinblastine (AVLB) is a dimeric monoterpenoid indole alkaloid present in *Catharanthus roseus* (L.) G. Don leaves [1–4], where it is believed to be the metabolic precursor of the anticancer drugs vinblastine (VLB) and vincristine (VCR) (Scheme 1). These compounds were the first natural anticancer agents to be clinically used [5], and are still an indispensable part of most curative regimens used in cancer chemotherapy [6].

Despite the great pharmaceutical importance of and demand for VLB and VCR, the characterization of AVLB, VLB and VCR biosynthesis, and of the enzymes involved, together with their regulation, remains incomplete in *C. roseus* leaves. In fact, although a number of enzymes of the indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway have been isolated and extensively studied in this plant [7,8], the dimerizing step, which is catalyzed by a putative AVLB synthase, and which is particularly important from a regulatory point of view [9], has not been characterized. Feeding experiments have shown that AVLB is the direct product of the coupling of catharanthine and vindoline in planta [1] (Scheme 1), and that it may be further converted to VLB and VCR by cell-free extracts of *C. roseus* [10–12].

Preliminary studies on the coupling reaction have shown that peroxidase-like activities from *C. roseus* cell suspension cultures are capable of synthesizing AVLB [13,14], although

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Plant material and chemicals

Plants of *C. roseus* (L.) G. Don (cv. Little Bright Eyes) were grown at 25°C in a growth chamber under a 16/8 h white fluorescent light photoperiod. Catharanthine sulfate and vindoline were obtained from Richter Gedeon (Budapest, Hungary). AVL B was obtained by enzymatic synthesis as reported [14], and characterized by optical rotation, circular dichroism and ${}^{1}$H-NMR. All other chemicals used in this work were obtained from Sigma (Madrid, Spain) and were of the highest purity available.

2.2. Enzyme purification and protein determination

All extraction and purification procedures were carried out at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. 418 g of leaves was homogenized in 75% (v/v) acetone at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with a mortar and pestle and the residue filtered under vacuum through filter paper. The protein precipitate was washed with 75% (v/v) acetone at $-20^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ until all the chlorophylls were washed out. The precipitate was resuspended in 1 M KCl in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, gently stirred for 2 h and centrifuged at $15,000 \times g$ for 20 min. The supernatant (crude extract) was fractionated with solid $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$, and the protein precipitated with 35% (w/v) salt saturation was discarded by centrifugation at $10,000 \times g$ for 30 min. The 35% (w/v) $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ soluble protein fraction was directly applied to a phenyl-Sepharose CL-4B column ($35 \times 1.5 \mathrm{~cm}$) at a flow rate of $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. After washing with two bed volumes of $1.5 \mathrm{M}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ in $50 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, bound proteins were eluted with a linear decreasing gradient of $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}(1.5-0.0 \mathrm{M}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{SO}_{4}$ at a concentration change rate of $25 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{min}$ with a flow rate of $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min})$ in $50 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. Fractions of $6 \mathrm{ml}$ were collected. The eight fractions showing the highest enzymatic activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against $50 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. The sample was then applied to a concanavalin A (Con A)-Sepharose 4B column ($26 \times 1 \mathrm{~cm}$) equilibrated with $50 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl, pH 7.5. After washing with two bed volumes of buffer, bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of $0-2.5 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{NaCl}, 0.5 \mathrm{M}$ methyl $\alpha-\mathrm{D}$-mannopyranoside with a flow rate of $2 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Fractions of $2 \mathrm{ml}$ were collected. The six fractions with the highest activity were pooled and directly loaded on a Sephacryl S-200 HR column ($45 \times 2.6 \mathrm{~cm}$) equilibrated with $50 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, which was also used for elution at a flow rate of $0.6 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Fractions of $3 \mathrm{ml}$ were collected and the six fractions with the highest activity were pooled and dialyzed overnight against $20 \mathrm{mM}$ MES-Tris, pH 6.0. For molecular mass determination, the column was calibrated and void volume determined with the Sigma kit for molecular weights of 12,000–200,000. The sample obtained from the above chromatography was applied to a Bio-Rad cation exchange Econopac-S column ($5 \mathrm{~cm}$ length) equilibrated with $20 \mathrm{mM}$ MES-Tris, pH 6.0. After washing with two bed volumes, basic proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of $0.0-0.35 \mathrm{M} \mathrm{KCl}$ with a flow rate of $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$. Fractions of $2 \mathrm{ml}$ were collected. The three fractions showing the highest activity were pooled, and constituted the purified enzyme preparation. Protein was estimated according to Bradford [20] using the Bio-Rad protein assay kit following the manufacturer's instructions and using bovine serum albumin as standard protein.

2.3. Assay of AVL B synthase activity by HPLC and determination of peroxidase activity

The assay of AVL B synthase activity was performed according to Sottomayor et al. [15]. The reaction assay contained $1.12 \mathrm{nmol}$ of *C. roseus* protein, $300 \mu \mathrm{M}$ vindoline, $540 \mu \mathrm{M}$ catharanthine sulfate, and $330 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ in $0.1 \mathrm{M}$ MES pH 6.8, in a final volume of $1.5 \mathrm{ml}$. The reaction proceeded for $45 \mathrm{~min}$ at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and was stopped by the addition of sodium borohydride to a final concentration of $21.1 \mathrm{mM}$. The mixture was basified to pH 9 with $0.1 \mathrm{ml}$ of $28 \%$ (v/v) $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$ aq., and the alkaloids extracted twice with ethylacetate. The combined extracts were evaporated to dryness, and the residue was dissolved in HPLC grade methanol. HPLC analyses were performed on a RP-C18 column ($125 \times 4 \mathrm{~mm}$) using methanol/water containing $0.1 \%$ (v/v) triethylamine, at a flow rate of $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, with the following multiple step gradient: $55 \%$ (v/v) methanol at $0 \mathrm{~min}, 65 \%$ (v/v) at $4 \mathrm{~min}, 67 \%$ (v/v) at $7 \mathrm{~min}, 70 \%$ (v/v) at $9 \mathrm{~min}, 71.5 \%$ (v/v) at $14 \mathrm{~min}, 90 \%$ (v/v) at $18 \mathrm{~min}$ and $55 \%$ (v/v) at $23 \mathrm{~min}$. Due to their complexity, alkaloid leaf extracts were analyzed by HPLC in a longer RP-C18 column ($250 \times 4.6 \mathrm{~mm}$) using the same methanol/water mixture containing $0.1 \%$ (v/v) triethylamine, at a flow rate of $1 \mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$, with the following multiple step gradient: $55 \%$ (v/v) methanol at $0 \mathrm{~min}, 65 \%$ (v/v) at $5 \mathrm{~min}, 70 \%$ (v/v) at $15 \mathrm{~min}, 80 \%$ (v/v) at $18 \mathrm{~min}, 90 \%$ (v/v) at $35 \mathrm{~min}$ and $55 \%$ (v/v) at $40 \mathrm{~min}$. Alkaloids were detected at $254 \mathrm{~nm}, 270 \mathrm{~nm}$ and $280 \mathrm{~nm}$.

Identification and quantitation of AVL B in HPLC was made by co-injection, and by comparing retention time, UV spectra and peak areas with those of an external standard. The peak corresponding to AVL B had previously been identified by ${}^{1} \mathrm{H}-\mathrm{NMR}[14]$. The detection limit of the assay was of $1 \mathrm{pmol}$ AVL B/s. Peroxidase activity was estimated at $30^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ with 4-methoxy-$\alpha$-naphthol as substrate according to Ferrer et al. [21].

2.4. Determination of the $k_{3}$ constants for AVL B synthase

The kinetic constants for AVL B synthase were determined by spectrophotometric assays of reaction media containing $0.5 \mu \mathrm{M} C$. roseus AVL B synthase, $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ vindoline, $1 \mu \mathrm{M}$ catharanthine sulfate and $1 \mu \mathrm{M} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{2}$ in $20 \mathrm{mM}$ Tris-MES (pH 6.0). AVL B synthase concentration was calculated using $\varepsilon_{403}=102.0 \mathrm{mM}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$. For kinetic measurements, the concentration of the ferric form of the enzyme ($\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}$) and compound II (CoII) were determined using $\varepsilon_{403}(\mathrm{CoII})=61.85 \mathrm{mM}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}, \varepsilon_{418}(\mathrm{CoII})=96.51 \mathrm{mM}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$ and $\varepsilon_{418}\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}\right)=53.26 \mathrm{mM}^{-1} \mathrm{~cm}^{-1}$, according to:

$$
A_{403}=\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}\right] \times \varepsilon_{403}\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}\right)+\left[\mathrm{CoII}\right] \times \varepsilon_{403}(\mathrm{CoII})
$$

and

$$
A_{418}=\left[\mathrm{CoII}\right] \times \varepsilon_{418}(\mathrm{CoII})+\left[\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}\right] \times \varepsilon_{418}\left(\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}\right)
$$

It was assumed that compound I (CoI) concentration was not significant compared with the concentrations of $\mathrm{Fe}^{3+}{ }_{\mathrm{p}}$ and CoII. CoII reduction rates for vindoline and catharanthine were estimated from the progress curves of CoII. CoII reduction constants ($k_{3}$) were estimated from the CoII reduction rates, assuming that $v /\left([\mathrm{CoII}][\mathrm{R}_{3} \mathrm{~N}]\right)=k_{3}$.

2.5. Gel electrophoresis and staining

All types of gel electrophoresis were performed on a Pharmacia (Sevilla, Spain) PhastSystem. SDS-PAGE was carried out in PhastGel gradient medium 8-25 with PhastGel SDS buffer strips. Isoelectric focusing was performed with PhastGel Dry IEF using Pharmacia Ampholine pH 3.5–10.0 to generate the pH gradient. Protein staining was carried out with the PhastGel Silver Kit. All the procedures were performed according to Pharmacia PhastSystem protocols. Peroxidase activity was stained with 4-methoxy-$\alpha$-naphthol [21].

cell-free crude protein extracts, and this could explain why this enzymatic activity had not been detected until recently in *C. roseus* leaves [15]. However, this activity can be unmasked by homogenization of frozen leaves in acetone at –20°C and further chromatography on phenyl-Sepharose. For this reason, purification of AVL B synthase activity from *C. roseus* leaves was initiated with these two preliminary steps. Further purification of AVL B synthase was performed by using a protocol directed at purifying mannose-rich vacuolar glycoproteins using Con A. After Con A chromatography, gel filtration on Sephacryl S-200 and cation exchange chromatography, a highly purified AVL B synthesizing protein with a specific activity of 1.8 nkat/mg was obtained. The specificity of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme for the coupling product is shown in Fig. 1. According to Fig. 1, the protein performs the coupling reaction of catharanthine and vindoline to yield AVL B as the major detectable coupling product, in a reaction strictly dependent on H₂O₂. In HPLC, the peak corresponding to AVL B had been previously identified by ¹H-NMR, optical rotation and circular dichroism [14]. The specificity of the in vitro reaction for AVL B as the major coupling product is in accordance with the alkaloid shading pattern shown by *C. roseus* leaves, in which catharanthine, vindoline, and its coupling product, AVL B, are the principal alkaloids (Fig. 2).

Protein purity was checked by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, which indicated the apparent homogeneity of the AVL B synthesizing protein (Fig. 3). The molecular weight was estimated to be 45.40 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) and 41.04 kDa by gel filtration in Sephacryl S-200. Thin-layer IEF confirmed the apparent homogeneity of the protein and enabled us to estimate the pI of the protein to be around 10.7 (Fig. 4).

The main structural properties of AVL B synthase are as follows. The VIS spectrum of the native form of AVL B synthase shows maxima at both 404 nm (Soret band), and 501 and 633 nm (α and β absorption bands), indicating that this enzyme is a high spin ferric heme protein, belonging to the plant peroxidase superfamily, the prosthetic group therefore being ferric protoporphyrin IX. In fact, this purified AVL B synthesizing protein showed peroxidase activity (1.9 μkat/mg when assayed with the non-natural substrate 4-methoxy-α-naphthol) and an Rz (*A*₄₀₃ₙₘ/*A*₂₈₀ₙₘ) value of 3.1 (Table 1). Because the AVL B synthase activity of this protein was masked until the phenyl-Sepharose chromatography step, it was not possible to calculate the final degree of purification starting from the acetone powder. However, since the perox-

idase-like activity of this protein was not inhibited by the endogenous inhibitors of AVL B synthase activity, it was possible to express the purification degree on the basis of this enzymatic activity. When this was done, the purification degree for the protein was calculated to be 192-fold (Table 1).

### 3.2. Catalytic properties

The catalytic properties of this protein in AVL B formation were studied. The AVL B synthase activity of this protein has an optimal pH of around 6.5, although it also shows substantial activity in the 4–5 pH range (Fig. 5), which is the pH range commonly found in plant vacuoles [19].

The capacity of catharanthine and vindoline to act as reducers (substrates) of the oxidized ferric states of AVL B synthase was also studied. CoI of the enzyme was obtained upon addition of H₂O₂ to the native ferric form of AVL B synthase. In the presence of catharanthine and vindoline, the transition from CoI to CoII is so fast that it cannot be detected. That is, CoII appeared as the major intermediary species to be accumulated during the coupling reaction. Since the formation of the porphyrin π-cation radical, CoI, of AVL B synthase, and its further reduction to CoII is too fast to be detected, the effect of these alkaloids on the CoI reduction rate could not be estimated. However, the participation of CoI in the catalytic cycle of the enzyme may be inferred from the weak changes in absorbance at 411 nm (Fig. 6A), the putative isosbestic point between the ferric form of AVL B synthase and CoII.

These results indicate that CoII reduction of AVL B synthase is the rate-limiting step during the coupling reaction between catharanthine and vindoline to yield AVL B. The decay of CoII to the native ferric form of the enzyme was clearly accelerated in the presence of vindoline and catharanthine (Fig. 6B). When the capacity of catharanthine alone or vindoline alone to reduce CoII of AVL B synthase was studied, it was found that both were substrates for CoII reduction. The values found for the compound II reduction constant, *k₃*, were 0.66 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹ for catharanthine and 1.17 mM⁻¹ s⁻¹ for vindoline.

## 4. Discussion

In this work, an AVL B synthase (peroxidase-like) protein capable of performing the coupling of catharanthine and vindoline to give AVL B as the main coupling product (Fig. 1) was purified from *C. roseus* leaves, and its molecular and kinetic properties are reported. This enzyme was purified until homogeneity (Figs. 3 and 4) using a five-step protocol designed to purify mannose-rich vacuolar glycoproteins. The enzyme showed a molecular weight of 45.40 kDa by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 3) and 41.04 kDa by gel filtration in Sephacryl S-200, which suggests that the enzyme is a monomeric protein, with a pI of around 10.7. However, pI determination of this extremely basic protein was hindered by the fact that there are no commercially available ampholines to create pH gradients above 10, so it is highly probable that the pI of AVL B synthase is actually higher than 10.7.

The VIS spectrum of the protein presents maxima at 404, 501 and 633 nm, indicating that this enzyme is a high spin ferric heme protein, belonging to the plant peroxidase superfamily, as was also demonstrated by its ability to oxidize a

common phenolic substrate at the expense of H₂O₂. This protein was located in mesophyll vacuoles [15] at the level of the internal face of the tonoplast [16], and it is in direct contact with catharanthine and vindoline, two alkaloids also located in vacuoles [17–19], and which are the two substrates used by the enzyme for the synthesis of AVL B (Fig. 1). It is worth noting that vindoline and catharanthine (the substrates of the enzyme) and AVL B (the product of the enzymatic reaction) constitute the three main indole alkaloids found in C. roseus leaves (Fig. 2), supporting a further physiological meaning for the specificity of the in vitro reaction (Fig. 1).

Support for this statement was obtained from the specific activity of the enzyme during AVL B synthesis. Thus, in optimal conditions, the specific activity of this protein to mediate the coupling reaction between catharanthine and vindoline to yield AVL B is 1.8 nkat/mg. This specific activity towards AVL B production is of the same order as that shown by the preceding enzymes of the bis-indole alkaloid biosynthetic pathway until now purified from C. roseus leaves: tryptophan decarboxylase (2.7 nkat/mg) [22], the 2-oxoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase involved in vindoline biosynthesis (0.09 nkat/mg) [8] and geraniol 10-hydroxylase (0.52 nkat/mg) [23]. All these reasons appear to be sufficient evidence for considering this enzyme the true, and to date unidentified, AVL B synthase, which is ultimately responsible for AVL B synthesis in C. roseus leaves.
