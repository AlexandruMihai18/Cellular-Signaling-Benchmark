In mammals, smell is mediated by odorant receptors expressed by sensory neurons in the nose. These specialized receptors are found both on olfactory sensory neurons' cilia and axon terminals. Although the primary function of ciliary odorant receptors is to detect odorants, their axonal role remains unclear but is thought to involve axon guidance. This review discusses findings that show axonal odorant receptors are indeed functional and capable of modulating neural connectivity.

### Organization of the Mammalian Olfactory System

The organizational plan of the mammalian olfactory system differs in several ways from other sensory modalities. At the periphery, olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) are dispersed across a convoluted epithelial sheet that shows only a coarse topographic order revealed by the zonal expression of individual odorant receptors (ORs). The cloning of this large family of receptors by Linda Buck and Richard Axel more than two decades ago as well as the molecular characterization of olfactory signal transduction opened the olfactory field to a new level of understanding. This classic work showed that each OSN expresses only one of ~1,000 different OR (7, 86, 58). The OR is a G protein-coupled receptor present in the sensory cilia that, upon binding of odorant ligands, activates a specific G protein, $G_{olf}$, which in turn stimulates adenyl cyclase III (ACIII) to synthesize cAMP (4, 6, 46). Cyclic AMP then binds to and opens an olfactory-specific cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNG), which leads to an influx of $Ca^{2+}$ and $Na^{+}$ and also activates a $Ca^{2+}$-gated $Cl^{-}$ channel that induces an efflux of $Cl^{-}$ from the cilia (5, 50, 64, 77, 78). In combination, this signaling pathway leads to OSN depolarization.

The cloning of the OR genes immediately enabled in situ hybridization studies, which showed that OSNs expressing the same OR are typically located in one of four broad zones that subdivide the olfactory epithelium (OE) along the dorsoventral axis. Interestingly, within each zone, OSNs expressing different receptors are intermixed, suggesting a seemingly random spatial organization of OSNs at the periphery (80, 99). This observation illustrated for the first time that, unlike vision or somatosensation, the sensory neurons in the olfactory system are not distinguished by their precise position in the peripheral sensory sheet but rather by the odorant receptor that a given neuron chooses to express. As a result, the OR not only defines the response properties for each OSN but also its molecular identity and connectivity.

Olfactory information is sent directly from the OE to the olfactory bulb (OB) where OSN axons coalesce to form glomeruli, anatomical structures primarily consisting of neuropil. In the OB, spatial order is quickly achieved as OSNs expressing the same receptor each converge with exquisite precision onto a few specific glomeruli on the surface of the OB, usually one on the medial and one on the lateral side of each OB. This pattern of axonal convergence forms the anatomical basis of the olfactory sensory map (57). The spatial organization of the olfactory map was first demonstrated using in situ hybridization with specific OR probes revealing discrete bilaterally symmetric signals in each OB (79, 98). These signals were interpreted to be the points of convergence of OSN axons that express the same OR, thus revealing two important points: 1) that the mRNA for the ORs is present in OSN axon terminals and 2) that axons from OSNs expressing the same OR converge in the same loci. This second point was later verified using a genetic approach to tag the OR genes when Mombaerts and colleagues succeeded in “visualizing the olfactory map.” In this classic study, the P2 receptor was genetically modified to co-express a tau-LacZ reporter (59). In these “P2-LacZ” mice, the P2-expressing axons converge in a specific location to form P2-glomeruli on the medial and lateral sides of each OB. Importantly, although the precise location of a given glomerulus is quite similar among different animals, it is not identical. One study by Diego Restrepo's group systematically mapped the location of P2 glomeruli across many animals and revealed clear variation within an area of the OB encompassing 29–37 glomeruli, demonstrating that P2 glomerular location is not entirely fixed (82). Another study in which a set of neighboring glomeruli were labeled with different markers showed that, although they consistently form

within the same restricted domain of the OB, their
location relative to each other seemed to shift (92).
Together, these data suggest that regions of the
olfactory map may indeed be stereotyped but that
the local permutation of glomeruli can vary within
that region.

The circuitry within the OB is also highly orga-
nized. As OSNs enter glomeruli, they synapse di-
rectly with both mitral and tufted cells (OB
projection neurons) as well as periglomerular cells
(OB interneurons). Studies have shown that the
different cell types of the OB form a columnar
structure with each glomerulus providing unique
input to its own column of cells, thus defining the
“odor column” as the functional unit of the OB
(89). Anatomical tracer studies have also revealed
that the bilateral olfactory maps are connected
through a set of intrabulbar projections mediated
through tufted cells that specifically link the odor
column circuitry of glomeruli that receive input
from the same OR (3, 53). This imparts the same
level of precision found in the glomerular olfactory
map to a second-order map composed of central
neurons. Moreover, sensory deprivation experi-
ments have revealed that the intrabulbar map
maintains a high level of plasticity throughout life
and that odorant-induced activity drives its orga-
nization (20). Here, we review recent studies aimed
at understanding the mechanism underlying the
role of the OR in circuit formation. Notably, this
review is limited to the mammalian olfactory sys-
tem and the axonal signaling of the OR, with selec-
tive coverage reflecting the authors’ own research
interests. More extensive analysis on the role of
guidance molecules and OSN activity in olfactory
sensory map formation can be found in several
recent excellent reviews (16, 22, 60, 63).

**Involvement of the OR in the**
**Axon Guidance Process**

The tight link between the expression of a given
receptor and the convergence of axons expressing
the same OR to the same glomeruli suggested a
model in which the OR was playing two distinct
roles in OSN function: 1) detecting odors and 2)
determining axonal target selection in the OB. In
this manner, the OR would not only translate
chemical stimuli from the external world to elec-
trical signals but also help determine the transfer
of that information to the brain by guiding OB
circuit formation. Evidence for this “dual role” in
OR function was first shown by the Axel laboratory
through genetic manipulation (103). A study by
Wang et al. revealed that either deleting or intro-
ducing a nonsense mutation in a given OR coding
sequence, such as the P2 receptor, disrupted axonal
convergence onto a specific glomerulus, causing the

axons from these cells to disperse in the bulb.
Subsequent experiments showed that deletion of
an OR coding sequence caused the OSN to select
and express a different OR, usually one that is in
close sequence proximity to the deleted OR. Nev-
ertheless, the axons of these OSNs that now ex-
press different ORs target different glomeruli,
typically within a restricted region of the OB (86,
90). These findings strengthened the link between
the OR identity and the selection of the precise
glomerular locus within the OB.

Receptor substitution experiments further sup-
ported OR function in axon guidance. In these
experiments, Wang et al. showed that replacing the
P2 receptor coding region with the coding region of
the P3 receptor, which is a closely related OR that
is expressed in the same epithelial zone, caused the
projection of the resulting P3 → P2 axons to con-
verge in a glomerulus that was adjacent to, but not
the same as, the endogenous P3 glomerulus. Sim-
ilar findings were observed when the M71 coding
sequence was swapped into the P2 gene locus in
that the resulting M71 → P2 glomerulus never oc-
cupied the same position as the endogenous M71
or P2 glomeruli; instead, it was usually located
between them, displaced along the antero-poste-
rior axis of the OB (FIGURE 1). Interestingly, the
degree to which the swapped glomerulus is shifted
with respect to the endogenous glomeruli was influ-
enced by a few parameters: 1) sequence homology
between the swapped genes, 2) the chromosomal
loci in which the genes are located, and 3) the epi-
thelial zones occupied by the OSNs that endoge-
nously express the ORs. In general, the more similar
OR genes are with respect to these factors, the closer
the glomeruli that result from swapping their coding
regions would be to their endogenous glomerular
location. Together, these findings demonstrated that
the OR identity plays an instructive role in the selec-
tion of the glomerular target, but it is not the sole
determinant.

A more detailed series of receptor substitution
experiments was performed by Paul Feinstein in
Peter Mombaerts’ laboratory, where he systemati-
cally swapped discrete regions between two closely
related ORs, the M71 and M72 receptors (27, 28).
The results were similar to those in the Wang study
but with some important distinctions. Feinstein’s
results demonstrated the presence in the OR gene
of a “core” sequence that was sufficient and nec-
essary to define the identity of the OR and thus
required for proper targeting. Furthermore, muta-
tions in the OR sequence that reduce the level of
the OR expression also caused mistargeting of
OSNs and the formation of ectopic glomeruli, sug-
gesting protein level is important (27, 28). Interest-
ingly, the results varied, depending on the type of
G-protein-coupled receptor that was introduced in

the OR locus. Feinstein showed that OSNs expressing the β2-adrenergic receptor from the M71 receptor gene locus are able to converge to form distinct glomeruli on both the lateral and medial sides of each OB. Moreover, the location of these β2-adrenergic receptor → M71 glomeruli was conserved and symmetrical but shifted anterior and ventral with respect to the endogenous M71 glomeruli (27). By contrast, when the OR sequence was replaced with another seven transmembrane receptor, V1R, which does not couple to the same class of G-proteins, the OSN axons fail to converge and form glomeruli. These data highlight the importance of the OR/G-protein signaling pathway in providing the OSN axons with instructions for proper axonal convergence. The shift in the glomerular location observed in OSNs expressing the β2-receptor is likely due to the absence of signaling from a specific OR that can affect the proper level of cAMP and other signaling molecules. These molecules could act locally or at the nuclear level, regulating the expression of other guidance factors involved in the location rather than the convergence of OSN axons. Together, these findings highlighted the relevance of the OR structure as a seven transmembrane, G-protein-coupled receptor and the importance of that feature in OSN axonal convergence. Notably, the OR also functions as a “chemosensing receptor” in sperm, where it modulates flagellar movements affecting chemiotaxis (30). Regenerating myocytes also express ORs where they mediate cell migration and adhesion (35). These data suggest that the OR chemotactic functions are preserved and thus exploited by several systems to regulate processes that involve motility and targeting.

**OR Signaling at the Axon Terminal**

The mechanism underlying the role of the OR in axon guidance remains largely unknown, although from the early characterization of OR genes it was hypothesized (103) and later confirmed that OR protein is present in the OSN axon terminal (1, 93). From this location, it is more conceivable that the OR could play a direct role in the axon guidance process. One model proposes that the OR functions as an axon guidance receptor capable of recognizing internal molecular cues elaborated by cells in the OB. In this manner, the OR would provide the axon with information to assure proper OSN targeting (1, 103). A second model suggests that the convergence of similar axons to form glomeruli in specific loci of the OB is primarily due to homotypic interactions among axons expressing the same OR (28, 60, 89). Although these models would rely on different mechanisms, they are not mutually exclusive, so they may indeed coexist but perhaps in different phases of the guidance process. Since assembly of the sensory map is complex, it is likely a multistep process involves many molecules with different temporal and spatial regulation such that different mechanisms could dominate at different stages.

The OR protein is concentrated in the distal portion of the OSN axon with the soma and the proximal part of the axon appearing devoid of OR expression (1, 93). The presence of OR-mRNA associated with polyribosomes at the axon terminal has also been shown, suggesting that the OR is locally translated in this location (25). Together, these findings support a direct role for the OR in

Schematic illustrating the effect of altered OR expression on the targeting of OSN axons to the olfactory bulb. A: diagram shows that in wild-type conditions OSNs expressing the same OR project axons that converge onto the same glomerulus in the OB. The M71 (blue) and P2 (red) receptors are expressed by OSNs in different zones of the OE and send their projections to different regions of the OB. B: OR Swap experiments showed that substituting the coding sequence of the M71 odorant receptor into the P2 receptor gene locus allows expression of M71 in P2 neurons, causing their axons to mistarget, thereby shifting the location of OSN convergence to a region that is somewhere between the endogenous locations of either the M71 or P2 glomeruli. C: deletion of the OR coding sequence from either the M71 gene or the P2 gene loci causes their OSN axons to project diffusely within a subregion of the olfactory bulb that is near the endogenous locus of their glomeruli.

the axon guidance process. However, to ascribe any specific function to the OR as an “axonal receptor,” it was crucial to establish whether it was indeed functional and to identify an associated signaling pathway.

As noted above, early studies showed that activation of the OR at the dendritic cilia was coupled to local increases of cAMP and Ca²⁺ through activation of an olfactory-specific cyclic-nucleotide-gated channel (i.e., CNG), but the physiological properties and signaling pathway of the OR at the axon terminal remained obscure until recently. By studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of cAMP and Ca²⁺, Maritan and colleagues (54) performed real-time imaging in living OSNs either transfected with a genetically encoded PKA-based sensor for cAMP (106, 107) or loaded with the Ca²⁺ indicator fura-2 to demonstrate that the OR at the axon terminal is a functional receptor that can elicit local increases of cAMP and Ca²⁺ through the

activation of olfactory CNG channels (FIGURE 2). Using Forskolin, which is a generic activator of the adenylyl cyclase, the study first demonstrated that increases in cAMP levels are coupled not only to the OR expressed at the cilia but also to the OR at the axon terminals. They then showed that bath application of odorants also prompted a sharp rise in both cAMP and Ca²⁺ levels throughout the entire neuron, from the cilia to the axon terminal. Interestingly, independent of the stimulus used, cAMP levels always increased first at the dendritic cilia and at the axon terminal and then in the soma. Finally, using direct application of odors with a pipette to the axon terminal of OSNs containing either the cAMP sensor or the Ca²⁺ indicator fura-2, they demonstrated a respective rise in cAMP or Ca²⁺ exclusively at the terminal. Maritan et al. concluded that the Ca²⁺ rise was due to the cAMP-dependent activation of the olfactory CNG channels since they were absent when either CNG

ORs play a dual signaling role in OSNs. A: ORs located in the OSN cilia are used for odor detection, whereas ORs in the axon terminals are likely used for axon guidance. The OR activation is coupled to local increases of cAMP, Ca²⁺, and cGMP not only at the cilia but also at the axon terminal (54, 76), as depicted in the boxes. B: functional imaging of cAMP dynamics in an OSN transiently transfected with a genetically encoded sensor for cAMP. Upon application of odorants at the axon terminal/growth cone with a glass pipette, a rise in cAMP is observed exclusively in the terminal region. No signal is observed in the other compartments, as also indicated in the graph (B, bottom). Time = 0, basal condition; time = 210 s, peak of cAMP response upon odor stimulation.

channel inhibitors or adenyl cyclase inhibitors were applied.

To determine whether the axonal signaling pathway observed in isolated neurons is also functional in a more intact olfactory system, experiments were repeated in “hemi-head” preparations, where the head is divided along the midline, which exposes the medial aspect of the OB while retaining the connectivity with both the OE and the brain. The OSNs were loaded with Ca²⁺ indicators in vivo, and the spatiotemporal dynamics of Ca²⁺ at the axon terminals were analyzed in vitro through this hemi-head preparation. Consistent with the dissociated OSN data, focal application of pharmacological agents or odorant stimuli induced clear increases in Ca²⁺ at the glomerular level (101). Interestingly, these studies also revealed that axonal OR activation is coupled to the translocation of the protein kinase A (PKA) to the nucleus, where it could potentially regulate gene expression through CREB phosphorylation (54). If so, cAMP produced at the axon terminal would not only exert its action locally but also at the level of the nucleus. Altogether, these results provided compelling evidence that the OR at the axon terminal is indeed a functional receptor coupled to local increases of cAMP and Ca²⁺.

Recent experiments by Imai and colleagues have highlighted the central role of the OR-derived cAMP signal in the development of the sensory map. These studies showed that cAMP, derived from activation of Gₛ, a G-protein capable of coupling to the OR, is essential for proper OSN axon targeting (40). OSNs bearing a mutation in the OR coding region involving the DRY sequence, a conserved tripeptide motif that is required for coupling of the OR to its partner G-protein, failed to converge on specific glomeruli. Interestingly, co-expression of a constitutively active Gₛ mutant restores the axonal convergence, whereas partial rescue is obtained with constitutively active forms of PKA and the transcription factor CREB, also supporting the involvement of molecules associated with nuclear signaling. Interestingly, although excess levels of cAMP obtained through constitutive Gₛ activity enabled OSNs to converge, they also induced a displacement in the corresponding glomeruli along the antero-posterior axis of the OB. Therefore the levels of cAMP appear to affect both the axonal convergence and the location of the resulting glomeruli (14, 19, 40, 96). This effect has been shown to involve the cAMP-dependent regulation of axon guidance molecules, such as neuro-pilin-1 (19, 40). These findings further support a dual role of the cAMP signaling, both at the axon terminal and at the nucleus (34, 104). The prominent role of cAMP and Ca²⁺ in directing the growth cone elongation and turning behavior has been demonstrated

in several systems (34, 69, 111, 112). Remarkably, the levels of cAMP regulate the response of the growth cone to the same gradients of axon guidance molecules (70, 91), corroborating the critical role of cAMP in axon targeting, as observed in the OSNs.

Although cAMP is the primary cyclic nucleotide produced on OR activation, cGMP is also synthesized. Compared with the odor-induced rise of cAMP, cGMP presents slow and sustained kinetics. This timing suggests that cGMP may not be involved in initial stimulus detection events but rather in several important, long-term cellular responses to odor stimulation such as neuronal development and OR long-term adaptation (48, 115). By studying the spatio-temporal dynamics of cGMP in OSNs transfected with a genetically encoded sensor for cGMP, Pietrobon and colleagues demonstrated that cGMP is locally produced on activation of the OR not only at the cilia but also at the axon terminal in response to pharmacological and physiological (odorant) stimuli (76). The odorant-dependent rise in cGMP is due to soluble guanylyl cyclase activation by nitric oxide (NO) and requires an increase of cAMP. The link between cAMP and NO synthase appears to be the rise in cytosolic Ca²⁺ concentration elicited by either plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channel activation or Ca²⁺ mobilization from stores via the guanine nucleotide exchange factor Epac. Cyclic GMP, as observed for cAMP (see above), can exert its action locally as well as at the nuclear level. Odor-evoked activation of the OR at the axon terminal, both in vitro and in vivo, elicits the phosphorylation of nuclear CREB. Thus these data suggest that not only cAMP but also the cGMP produced at the axon terminal could be relevant for axon pathfinding, acting both locally and at the nuclear level by regulating gene expression of axon guidance molecules. Notably, in other systems, it has been demonstrated that the ratio of cAMP to cGMP plays a critical role in the axon turning behavior (72). A high ratio favors attraction, whereas a low ratio mediates repulsion. The presence of Epac at the axon terminal in the signaling pathway that leads to cGMP synthesis is also significant, since in other systems Epac has been shown to be involved, along with cyclic nucleotides, in neurite outgrowth and turning (62). Together, these experiments demonstrate the tight interplay in the regulation and action of cAMP, cGMP, and Ca²⁺, which are all modulated by the activation of the OR at the axon terminal. The local translation and the expression of a functional OR at the axon terminal is in line with a growing body of evidence that defines the axon as an autonomous compartment where translation of molecules involved in the axon guidance process takes place (36, 51). The major advantage of the local

synthesis is to endow the axon with the remarkable capability to respond promptly to the axon guidance molecules encountered along its path to the proper target.

Thus far, we have discussed the potential role of broad signaling molecules such as cyclic nucleotides and Ca²⁺ in the axon guidance process; however, the downstream pathways involved in axon elongation and turning are still undetermined. Interestingly, previous studies have revealed the presence of apoptotic molecules in developing neurons (37, 43) and have implicated their involvement in axonal pruning and growth cone dynamics (10, 32, 71). In addition, apoptosis signaling has also been shown to play a role in OSN development and glomerular map formation during late embryonic stages (23, 24, 74, 75). One study recently demonstrated that a protein called Fas-associated factor 1 (Fasl), an apoptosis signaling modulator, could alter the wiring of OSN axons in the OB postnatally (13). Using transgenic animals, this study showed that overexpression of Fasl selectively in immature OSNs at a stage in which they are actively seeking their glomerular targets in the OB resulted in severe axonal mistargeting. The results showed that OSNs not only missed their glomerular targets but also overextend past the glomerular layer and into the deep layers of the OB. Histological analysis revealed that glomerular organization was broadly disrupted and that the number of mature OSNs was significantly reduced. Interestingly, the dying neurons were not the immature Fasl-expressing neurons, suggesting that Fasl did not directly activate the cell death program but rather was responsible for the axonal mistargeting, which resulted in cell death as the OSNs matured and Fasl expression stopped. A similar model was proposed in previous studies that examined caspase-8 function in OSNs, suggesting that neurons targeting glomeruli in the olfactory bulb face a critical period of susceptibility to cell death upon arrival at their destination. If appropriate connections are made, the neuron will then continue its maturation and survive. However, if connections are not made, possibly due to inappropriate targeting, the neuron dies through a caspase-8-mediated signal (12). Perhaps most striking from the Fasl study is that, despite the broad mistargeting and glomerular disruption that results from Fasl overexpression, if Fasl levels are reduced, the system is capable of complete restoration even in adulthood. This suggests that the mechanisms necessary for OSN axon guidance are continuously present. One possibility is that axonal activation of ORs can effectively modulate local apoptotic signals that alter the intracellular structure of the growth cone, essentially controlling OSN axon guidance.


**Axon Guidance Molecules**

Although OR identity has clearly been shown to play an instructive role in axonal convergence, it is not the only determinant. There are likely many molecules involved in OSN axon guidance, yet it is still unclear how they are distributed and in which aspect of the targeting process they participate. One possibility is that guidance factors associated with the epithelial region or “zone” in which an OR is expressed largely determine the target region of the OB. Anatomical studies have shown that the zonal organization of the OE coarsely reflects the dorsal-ventral topography of the bulb. For example, OSNs located in the dorsal part of the OE tend to project their axons to the dorsal OB, whereas OSNs in the ventral OE project to the ventral aspect of the OB (42, 56). Thus the location of the OSNs in the epithelium may have direct bearing on the OB target region through guidance factors that may be associated with that portion of the OE. However, the identification of such zone-specific factors or the mechanism by which an OR gene is chosen to be expressed in a particular zone remains to be understood.

At a more specific level, glomerular location can be determined by modulating a few spatial coordinates: antero-posterior, ventro-dorsal, and latero-medial. Studies have sought to understand the role of axon guidance molecules in establishing the coordinates and have certainly met with some success. The antero-posterior axis appears to be dictated by the expression of ligands/receptor molecules such as ephrins, particularly ephrin A3 and A5 and their corresponding Eph receptors (21). In addition, semaphorin3A (Sema3A) and its receptor neuropilin1 (Nrp1) (18, 40, 41, 83, 84, 95) have also been shown to play a guidance role. Deletion or overexpression of Ephrin A3 and A5 causes a shift in the location of glomeruli along the antero-posterior axis, whereas Sema3A-deficient mice present a more significant perturbation both in shifting the location of the glomeruli and producing some small aberrant glomeruli.

As noted above, the dorso-ventral (D-V) axis corresponds to the epithelial zones in the OE, such that the D-V position of OSNs in the OE also determines the D-V region of axonal projections to the OB (97). Two sets of repulsive ligand/receptor molecules, Slit 1/Robo 2 (18) and neuropilin 2/semaphorin3F (Nrp2/Sema3F) (17, 18, 66, 73, 94, 102), have been shown to influence the projection of OSN axons along the D-V axis. Axons positive for Robo 2 navigate to the dorsal domain of the OB by the repulsive effect of the ligands Slit 1 and Slit 3, which are expressed in the ventral domain (15). Loss-of-function and gain-of-function experiments further

demonstrated that Nrp2 regulates the OSN axonal
projection along the D-V axis (94).

A third dimension within the OSN guidance process is the segregation of sensory projections to either the medial or lateral side of each olfactory bulb. Although this aspect of OSN axon targeting remains poorly understood, it has been shown that the insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) molecule is required for proper sensory innervation of the lateral olfactory bulb. Mutations that disrupt IGF1 signaling cause axons usually destined for the lateral bulb to target ectopic positions on the ventro-medial side of the OB (85). However, since mutations in the IGF1 gene also cause developmental phenotypes, it is difficult to completely discern its role in axon guidance.

Although OSN axons target a restricted domain in the OB, homotypic interactions also contribute to the specific segregation of like axons to form glomeruli. Two proteins, Kirrel2 and Kirrel3, are homophilic adhesive molecules, whose expression varies according to the OR expressed by the OSNs. Gain-of-function experiments with these genes can produce duplicated glomeruli even if the same OR is expressed, suggesting that these molecules are involved in the final process of attracting axons that express the same receptor to form individual glomeruli. The ephrins A and the EphA (21) are also expressed in a complementary manner by sensory neurons expressing different ORs and may be important in the segregation of like and non-like axons. Another molecule, BIG2, is expressed at the axon terminals of subpopulations of OSNs and promotes local sorting with unknown heterophilic binding partners (44). It has been shown that BIG2 is expressed in a mosaic pattern that is overlapping but not identical to the expression pattern of Kirrel2 and ephrinA5. In mice deficient in BIG2, olfactory sensory neurons expressing the same OR often target multiple glomeruli in ectopic positions. The OR molecule itself has also been hypothesized to mediate homotypic interactions among like sensory axons (28). It is unclear how this would function; however, one hypothesis would be an indirect homophilic interaction through an OR containing complex. The OR at the axon terminal would serve as a unique three-dimensional structure to accommodate a specific protein complex. This OR-containing complex would then favor interactions among axons containing similar ORs over axons with dissimilar ORs.

Studies have shown that the expression of OR genes is a highly regulated process. Two important principles have emerged from efforts to express functional ORs in heterologous and transgenic systems. First, OR genes contain regulatory elements both within upstream untranslated regions and within coding regions (28, 67, 98). Second, there is a feedback mechanism in place such that expression

of a functional OR protein blocks the expression of other ORs (49, 68, 90). These systems have made it difficult to test the role of ORs in axon guidance and assess to what degree they determine homophilic binding. Recently, two studies have overcome this OR expression roadblock using a transgenic approach that circumvents the OR regulatory mechanisms enabling broad expression of a single OR throughout the OE (29, 67). By utilizing the tetracycline transactivation system (tet-OFF), one group demonstrated that precocious expression or a transgenic OR can preempt the natural OR selection process and thus suppress expression of virtually all endogenous ORs (67). This “first come, first served” function enabled the broad expression of any individual OR at high levels throughout the OE. The second study utilized a similar tet-Off approach to broadly express a single OR (M71) under the control of a mature OSN promoter (OMP) and found that in one of seven transgenic lines they were able to see broad, high-level expression in virtually all mature OSNs (29). Notably, both studies showed that neurons that expressed a transgenic OR did not express endogenous ORs consistent with a common feedback mechanism for all ORs, regardless of gene cluster or epithelial zone. Interestingly, the broad, high-level expression of a single OR throughout the OE produced a fairly even distribution of glomeruli across the OB (29, 67) (FIGURE 3).

The studies mentioned above have proposed that the targeting of OSN axons along the A-P axis of the OB is based on intracellular cAMP levels determined in part by the particular OR that is expressed within the neuron (81). Thus different ORs would result in different levels of cAMP and different glomerular targets. Homophilic binding of OSN axons expressing similar ORs would also serve to further specify the precise glomerular location within a region of the OB. Although this successive addressing model is consistent with many molecular gradient studies, it is not completely compatible with the OR overexpression studies. Multiple transgenic mouse lines were generated to broadly express a variety of different class I and class II receptors driven by either mature or immature OR promoters, and in each case OSN axonal projections extended throughout the surface of the OB (29, 67, 68). Moreover, although most axons exclusively expressed only one OR, they neither formed a single large glomerulus composed of fibers expressing the same OR nor were restricted to a subregion of the OB as one might predict if either homophilic binding or cAMP level were the main determinant (67). These data suggest that, although a functional OR is essential for proper OSN axon guidance within a specific domain of the OB and for the coalescence of axons to form proper glomeruli, it is not the central determinant for overall
glomerular formation or location. Interestingly, the glomeruli that result from mice that overexpress a single OR are poorly organized, appearing less spherical and more disheveled than wild-type glomeruli. In addition, although most OSNs express the same OR in these mice, a minority of OSNs does not express the transgenic OR, and many of those axons are found intermingled with the transgene containing axons. Thus, from these data, it appears that the OR may actually play a more direct role in refining glomeruli rather than determining their overall location.

### Electrical Activity: Odorant-Induced and Spontaneous Activity

The OR translates chemical signals (odorants) into electrical signals, raising the question: What is the contribution of odorant-induced activity to the formation of the glomerular map? Activity plays a critical role in shaping neural circuits in many sensory modalities (38, 108). Molecular interactions usually instruct an early coarse pattern of innervation that is subsequently refined by activity-dependent processes (39, 45). The role of activity in olfactory circuitry formation is still a matter of significant debate. Mice bearing a null mutation in the α-subunit of the olfactory cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (CNGA2), a critical component of the OR signaling pathway, failed to exhibit odor-evoked responses (52). However, the ability of OSN axons expressing the same OR to converge into specific glomeruli is only subtly perturbed in these mutant mice (52, 110). This has been demonstrated by examining OSNs expressing several different ORs, although subtle perturbations in axonal convergence were observed for M72-expressing OSNs (110). Analogous results were observed in mice bearing a null mutation in G~olf~, the G-protein coupled to the OR receptor (2), again revealing striking reductions in the electrophysiological responses of OSNs to odorants, but axonal convergence remained unaltered. Interestingly, as G~olf~ mutant mice aged beyond 4 mo, mistargeted OSN axons became increasingly apparent (Belluscio L, unpublished data), suggesting that odorant-induced activity may serve to continuously refine the glomerular map, thus preventing the accumulation of targeting errors.

Since the CNGA2 gene is located on the X chromosome and thus subject to X inactivation, a series of experiments were also performed to examine axonal targeting with the mosaic expression of the null mutation in female mutant mice. These studies revealed a distinct situation in that the CNGA2^+/−^ females (mosaic for the null allele) exhibited a dramatic loss in the CNGA2^-^ axonal fibers, whereas the CNGA2^+^ fibers remained in large numbers (109). This loss was shown to be activity dependent such that the CNGA2^+^ OSNs capable of responding to odorants survived, whereas CNGA2^-^ OSNs were lost. This activity-dependent mechanism became more evident at the glomerular level as both CNGA2^+^ and CNGA2^-^ axons were shown to be capable of innervating glomeruli, but only the CNGA2^+^ persisted, whereas the CNGA2^-^ axons were gradually eliminated. These data revealed the presence of an activity-dependent competition mechanism in OSN projections similar to the visual system such that axons may initially target a common region, but the inactive fibers generally lose territory to active ones.

Activity has also been shown to modulate the expression level of molecules associated with axon sorting. For example, proteins such as Kirrel 2 and Eph A5 were shown to be downregulated in CNGA2-KO mice, whereas Kirrel 3 and Ephrin A5 were upregulated, suggesting that these genes are

**FIGURE 3.** Broad overexpression of a single OR shows widespread axonal distribution  
Illustration shows the effect of overexpressing a single OR in a large portion of the OSN population and its effects on glomerular formation. A: genetic expression of a single OR at high levels in >90% of all mature OSNs causes widespread expression in the OE and similar broad distribution of axons throughout the OB (29, 67), suggesting that, although the expression of a specific OR along with homophilic interactions among axons expressing the same OR may play a role in axonal coalescence, it is unlikely the primary determinant for regional targeting of OSNs. The latter is likely to be dictated by factors derived from the zone of the epithelium in which the OSNs are located. B: expression of a single OR in a smaller (~10%) yet equally dispersed OSN population also produces widespread distribution of axonal projections, demonstrating that diffusely distributed OSNs expressing the same OR do not necessarily all group together to form homogeneous glomeruli. This further supports the notion that factors apparently linked to the epithelial zones that direct them to different regions of the OB supersede the homophilic binding function of axons expressing the same OR, regardless of their density.

PHYSIOLOGY • Volume 27 • August 2012 • www.physiologyonline.org 207modulated in an activity-dependent manner (88). Surprisingly, despite the clear role that activity plays in regulating these molecules, the organization of the glomerular map is only subtly altered in CNGA2-KO, indicating that other mechanisms may be responsible for the initial targeting phase.

Although odor-evoked activity does not instruct the spatial targeting of OSNs to specific domains of the OB, it is involved in the refinement of that innervation. During development, OSNs expressing a given receptor converge to form glomeruli, but they also innervate some adjacent glomeruli, resulting in heterogeneous glomeruli, i.e., glomeruli composed of OSN axons expressing different ORs (80a). These heterogeneous glomeruli are supernumerary and are later eliminated as the glomerular map matures in an activity-dependent manner. Studies have shown that if odor-evoked activity is blocked at birth (e.g., through naris occlusion), these small heterogeneous glomeruli will persist in addition to the main homogeneous glomeruli (63, 114). Conversely, if OSN stimulation is increased by raising animals in the presence of odorants, the supernumerary glomeruli can also be pruned more rapidly (47). Interestingly, deletion of the Kiv3.1 potassium channel produces mice with a heightened sense of smell and an increased number of glomeruli that are reduced in size compared with controls (26). Nonetheless, despite these broad functional and anatomical phenotypes, when the specific targeting of P2OSN axons was analyzed in these mutant mice, they were shown to exhibit normal convergence. Together, these findings suggest that odor-evoked activity has only limited effects on glomerular convergence and likely exerts its primary role on glomerular refinement rather than OB topography.

A quite different situation was observed when another element of the OR signaling pathway was mutated: Adenylyl cyclase III (ACIII) is the enzyme that synthesizes cAMP in OSNs (19, 96, 113). Studies showed that the lack of ACIII affects the sensory map in several ways. Most prominently, the formation and organization of the glomeruli is perturbed such that OSN axons target the OB but fail to form distinct and well-defined glomeruli. In addition, many glomeruli are no longer homogeneous, innervated exclusively by fibers expressing the same OR, but rather contain fibers from different ORs (heterogeneous glomeruli). A similar disruption in glomerular organization was observed in mice that carry a mutation in the DRY portion of the I7-OR coding region, such that I7-OSN axons target the bulb, but failed to coalesce in proper glomeruli (40). Interestingly, the DRY region is the part of the OR deputed to bind the G-protein, such that mutating the DRY results in OSNs that cannot produce cAMP and thus phenocopy the ACIII-KO mice. By

comparison, in the ACIII-KO mice, axons expressing a given OR, such as M72 or MOR23, target both their endogenous locations and ectopic sites (19). Although a clear mechanism to explain this aberrant axon behavior is lacking, it has been proposed that axon fibers expressing the same OR may not be completely homogeneous. One possibility is that OSNs in different regions of the OE interact with different guidance molecules and thus may target the same glomeruli but do so through diverse mechanisms. Interestingly, expression of neuropilin 1, the semaphorin 3 receptor, is also altered in ACIII mutant mice but in a heterogeneous manner that would not affect all glomeruli (19). Similar defects were again observed in I7-DRY mutant mice, suggesting that cAMP can also regulate neuropilin 1 expression (40). This clear link to cAMP levels may be the critical feature that differentiates ACIII mutants from other OR signaling mutants with no odor-evoked activity but presents a normal glomerular map. In the CNGA2-KO mice, the mutation affects an element of the signaling pathway that is located downstream to the ACIII and cAMP synthesis. In the G~olf~ KO mice, a closely related protein subunit, Gas, is also present in the OSN and thus could potentially activate ACIII, to compensate for the lack of G~olf~.

OSNs also exhibit spontaneous electrical activity that is independent of odorant stimuli. In other sensory modalities such as vision, spontaneous activity has been shown to play a major role in sculpting neural circuits. During development of the visual system, formation of specific connections depends on action potentials generated by the retinal ganglion cells even before the retina receives visual inputs (31, 55). One study explored the role of spontaneous afferent activity in the olfactory system using two different genetically modified mouse lines (105). In one mutant line, the synaptic release of most OSNs was hampered through the expression of the tetanus toxin light chain (TeTXLC), a molecule that cleaves the synaptic vesicle protein VAMP2 that is necessary for synaptic vesicle docking. Surprisingly, these mutant mice could still form a proper glomerular map. By examining the organization of P2-OSNs labeled with GFP, this study showed that both expression of P2 in the OE and P2 axonal convergence in the OB was indistinguishable between controls and TeTXLC mutant mice. Similar results were also observed using OSNs expressing different ORs. These findings support the autonomous role of the OSN in driving their axons to the proper location in the OB, as was first observed in mice that were deficient in most OB postsynaptic neurons (8). Interestingly, in the TeTXLC mutant mice, the P2 glomeruli are established but not maintained as the animal ages. This gradual
withdrawal of preestablished projections in these
mice has been ascribed to the dramatic reduction in the complexity of the axon terminal arbors in neurons expressing the TeTXLC. These neurons exhibit normal development until postnatal day 6, at which point the axon terminal arbors begin to show a drastic reduction in morphological complexity likely resulting from synaptic instability eventually leading to axonal withdrawal (11).

A second mutant mouse line was also engineered to have very little afferent spontaneous activity due to the overexpression of the inward rectifying potassium (Kir2.1) channel in the OSNs (105). In this case, disruption of afferent spontaneous activity clearly altered initial OSN axon targeting to the OB. The study showed that axonal innervation to the OB was significantly delayed and that, on arrival, OSNs expressing the same OR targeted multiple glomeruli. As a consequence, the OB of these Kir2.1 mutant mice presents supernumerary glomeruli. By studying the organization of these glomeruli, we found that the overall increase in glomerular number can be accounted for by the increase in heterogeneous glomeruli for a given OR (Lodovichi C, unpublished observations). These results suggest that both the axonal targeting and the refinement process that result in homogeneous glomeruli are dependent on spontaneous activity.

The exact mechanism by which spontaneous activity influences neural circuit refinement in the OB is still unclear. One possibility is that OSN activity regulates the concentration of second messengers such as cAMP and Ca²⁺ that in turn can affect axon elongation and retractions both using local signaling (91) and more distant nuclear signaling by modulating gene expression (104). In this manner, disrupting the OSN firing pattern would affect the level of the second messengers and in turn the processes that they control. Another possibility considers that cyclic nucleotides locally produced at the axon terminals of OSNs have been shown to modulate synaptic transmission and also affect the stabilization of synaptic contacts (61). Thus, as OSN activity changes, the resulting fluctuations in cyclic nucleotide concentration could also affect the organization of established synaptic contacts. Still, a third possibility recognizes that electrical activity can facilitate the action of molecules, such as neurotrophic factors, in an activity-dependent manner (45). This trophic function can be used together with a competition mechanism to regulate axonal branch stability, as well as neurite extension and pruning. It has been shown that the action of neurotrophins must be coupled to afferent spontaneous activity to modulate neuronal plasticity in the developing visual cortex (9). Furthermore, active retinal ganglion cell axons are more responsive to the action of trophic factors

during development (33), when axonal competition is more pronounced. Similarly, the olfactory system may use the firing pattern of OSNs to modulate their response to trophic factors and/or guidance molecules within the OB. Since OSNs are constantly regenerating, they may be continuously utilizing activity-dependent competition to either maintain old connections or facilitate new ones as new neurons target glomeruli. In this way, active

**FIGURE 4. OSN axon targeting model**

The diagram illustrates that OSN axon targeting occurs through a combination of processes that are divided into three separate phases to progressively localize OSN axons to their proper targets. Phase 1: regional targeting of OSN axons. This process would rely primarily on molecular cues to direct axons toward specific yet restricted regions of the olfactory bulb and is directly linked to the zone of the epithelium in which OSNs are expressed. Phase 2: glomerular formation. Upon reaching their correct region, axons undergo local sorting and reorganization, likely through a combination of homophilic binding and local action of the OR expressed at the axon terminal. Phase 3: axonal refinement. Following glomerular coalescence, inappropriately targeted axons are pruned and/or re-targeted to appropriate glomeruli through an activity-dependent refinement process.

OSNs gain access to trophic and/or survival factors, enabling them to successfully establish connections, whereas inactive ones lose trophic support and become eliminated through caspase-mediated apoptosis (12). Overall, a competition mechanism would prove extremely useful not only to regulate glomerular formation but also to modulate the glomerular circuitry through continuous pruning and refinement of OSN axons.

In conclusion, the ability of OSN axons to target specific glomeruli in the olfactory bulb serves as a remarkable illustration of how neural networks form with great precision and can maintain their organization despite constant regeneration. We have highlighted a number of factors that appear to influence this organization, with the odorant receptor as a central player in the process. As with most complex mechanisms, there are likely to be many elements that combine to produce the final refined product. We present a model in which OSN axons target the OB through a series of sequential steps or phases that gradually deliver the axons to their precise location (FIGURE 4). This model utilizes an address approach in which the initial phase of the targeting process is used to localize axons to the correct region of the OB, with subsequent phases used to progressively “zero in” on specific glomeruli. Although the OR clearly plays a role in the targeting process, it is unclear whether its role is crucial to each phase. We propose that the regional targeting of OSN axons is primarily determined by series of molecular cues with little contribution by the odor receptor. By contrast, the odorant receptor likely plays a critical role in determining the final glomerular choice within that region through a combination of homophilic binding and OR-mediated axonal signaling. Finally, both spontaneous and OR-mediated odorant-induced activities appear to contribute to axonal and glomerular refinement in an interdependent manner. Since future studies are required to fully understand the functional role of ORs in OSN axons, recent developments in light-induced activation of specific neural circuits combined with genetic targeting will surely prove invaluable for determining their part in OSN axonal targeting.
