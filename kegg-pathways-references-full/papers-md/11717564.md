# Genetic defects in thyroid hormone synthesis
Mary P. Gillam, MD, and Peter Kopp, MD

Thyroid hormone synthesis requires a normally developed thyroid gland, a properly functioning hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis, and sufficient iodine intake. This article focuses on genetic defects in this axis. Defects that are primarily of developmental origin are discussed in our associated article in this issue [1]. Defects in hormone synthesis usually are associated with the development of a goiter, provided that the bioactivity and action of thyrotropin (TSH) are not impaired. In contrast, hypoplasia of the gland may be caused by developmental defects, bioinactive TSH, or resistance to TSH at the level of the receptor or its signaling pathway. At the other end of the spectrum, hyperthyroidism may result from gain of function mutations in genes regulating growth and function.

## Congenital hypothyroidism due to defects in hormone synthesis
Sporadic congenital hypothyroidism is caused most commonly by developmental defects (see associated article [1]). In 10 to 15% of patients, it is caused by defects in one of the multiple steps required for thyroid hormone synthesis (Fig. 1). Careful clinical, biochemical, and molecular analyses have enhanced our understanding of various defects caused by inactivating mutations in genes encoding proteins that are essential for thyroid hormone synthesis (Table 1).

## Normal thyroid hormone synthesis
Thyroid follicular cell differentiation and growth, as well as hormone synthesis, are under control of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis. The hypothalamic tripeptide TRH (TSH releasing hormone) stimulates the TRH receptor, a G-protein coupled seven transmembrane receptor (GPCR), in the thyrotrophs of the anterior pituitary gland to induce TSH synthesis and secretion. Thyrotropin, also acting through a GPCR expressed on the basolateral membrane of thyroid follicular cells, stimulates differentiation and growth of thyrocytes, as well as hormone synthesis [2] (Fig. 1). Thyrotropin acts primarily by coupling to Gsa, which subsequently activates adenyl cyclase. At higher concentrations of TSH, the receptor couples to Gq/11, resulting in activation of phospholipase C (PLC). Iodide, the rate-limiting substrate for thyroid hormone biosynthesis, is actively transported into thyroid follicular cells by the sodium-iodide symporter at the basolateral membrane [3]. Pendrin, a recently identified anion exchanger, may facilitate transport of iodine across the apical membrane [4, 5]. On the luminal side of the apical membrane, thyroperoxidase (TPO) oxidizes iodide and subsequently iodinates tyrosyl residues of the intrafollicular thyroglobulin (TG) (organization or iodination). The iodotyrosines, mono- and di-iodotyrosyl (MIT, DIT), are coupled to form T4 or T3, a reaction that also is catalyzed by TPO (coupling). The organization and coupling reactions require the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), which is generated by a flavoprotein-containing system. Recently, two nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidases (Thox1 and 2, also referred as Duox or Lnox), which may be part of this system, have been identified [6, 7]. TG, carrying T4 and T3, is internalized into the follicular cell by micro- and macropinocytosis and digested in lysosomes. While the thyronines T4 and T3 are

TSH is the major regulator of thyroid follicular cell growth and function. It consists of an α and β subunit and activates the TSH receptor. This results in activation of the cAMP – PKA pathway. High TSH levels also activate the PLC pathway. Nuclear transcription factors that are important for thyrocyte function include TTF1, TTF2, PAX8, and CREB (cAMP response element binding factor). Hormone synthesis requires active transport of iodide across the basolateral membrane by NIS. At the apical membrane, TPO organifies iodide into tyrosine residues on TPO generating MIT and DIT. MIT and DIT are coupled to T3 and T4. Both steps require the presence of H₂O₂. After pinocytosis, T3 and T4 are secreted into the bloodstream. MIT and DIT are deiodinated by a dehalogenase.

released into the blood stream, MIT and DIT are de-iodinated by a dehalogenase and recycled.

### Hypothalamic and pituitary defects resulting in hypothyroidism

#### TSH releasing hormone
Several clinical reports have suggested isolated TRH deficiency as a cause of central hypothyroidism [8, 9], but there are currently no reports on patients with documented defects in the $TRH$ gene. Targeted disruption of the $TrH$ gene in mice leads to hypothyroidism [10]. Surprisingly, the TSH concentrations in these mice are elevated, yet the biologic activity of the hormone is reduced. Notably, similar biochemical constellations with elevated TSH of reduced bioactivity have been reported in some individuals with central hypothyroidism [11].

#### TRH receptor
Resistance to TRH in pituitary thyrotrophs was discovered in a patient with isolated central hypothyroidism and a compound heterozygous defect in the TRH receptor [12]. Clinically, the patient presented with short stature, delayed bone age, and reduced intelligence. Biochemically, the patient had a T4 level in the hypothyroid range associated with a normal TSH; intravenous administration of TRH did not result in an increase in TSH and prolactin secretion.

#### Combined pituitary hormone deficiency
Genetic defects in the development and function of the pituitary gland can result in various forms of combined pituitary hormone deficiency (CPHD). Patients with CPHD present with impaired production and secretion

ability in the phenotypic expression among CPHD patients with PROP-1 mutations [18].

POU1F1

POU1F1 is a pituitary-specific transcription factor responsible for pituitary development and hormone expression. Mutations in the murine homologue Pit1 have been identified in the Snell and Jackson dwarf mice, which have deficiencies in GH, PRL, and TSH [13]. Subsequently, patients with identical hormone deficiencies were found to have mutations in the human homologue referred to as POU1F1 [14, 15]. The defect is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait if the mutation affects the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor. POU1F1 mutations that inactivate the transactivation properties of the protein, while retaining the ability to bind DNA, exert a dominant-negative effect and are thus inherited in an autosomal dominant manner.

LHX3

Recessive mutations in LHX3, a LIM homeodomain transcription factor, also cause CPHD of all anterior pituitary hormones with the exception of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) [19]. In addition, these patients have a rigid cervical spine and a limited ability to rotate the head [19]. In *Lhx3*-/– mice, the primordium of the anterior pituitary is present, but, with the exception of the corticotroph cells, there is no further growth and differentiation of the rostral part of the gland [20].

HESX1

HESX1, also referred to as RPX, is a member of the paired-box class of homeobox transcription factors. Familial septo-optic dysplasia, a syndromic form of CPHD associated with optic nerve hypoplasia and agenesis of midline structures in the brain, can be caused by homozygous mutations in HESX1 [21]. A similar phenotype was observed in *Hesx1*-/– mice [21]. Interestingly, a small proportion of the mice heterozygous for a *Hesx1* null allele also had a milder form of septo-optic dysplasia. This discovery prompted further screening of patients who present with a wide spectrum of congenital pituitary dysfunctions. A subset of these patients was indeed found to be heterozygous for HESX1 mutations [22]. Heterozygous HESX1 mutations result in various constellations of

PROP1

Characterization of the Ames dwarf (*df*) mouse led to the cloning of the paired-like homeodomain factor Prop-1 (Prophet of pit1) [16]. PROP-1 is necessary for the expression of POU1F1 and is involved in ontogenesis, differentiation, and function of somatotropes, lactotropes, thyrotropes, and possibly gonadotropes. Inactivating mutations in the human PROP-1 gene have been identified as a cause of an autosomal recessive CPHD phenotype affecting these cell lineages [17]. Notably, there is vari-

pituitary hormone deficiencies, and the phenotype is variable among family members with the same mutation.

**Thyrotropin**

Thyrotropin is formed of an α and β subunit, the α subunit being common to the glycoproteins TSH, FSH, and LH (Fig. 1). Congenital hypothyroidism caused by isolated hereditary TSH deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in the TSH β-chain [23, 24]. Thyrotropin is unmeasurable or very low, and the administration of TRH does not result in a rise in serum TSH. The concentrations and the function of the other pituitary hormones are normal, including an adequate rise of prolactin in response to TRH.

Recurrent mutations in the β-chain have been found in several Japanese (G29R) and Greek (E12X) families suggesting a founder effect [23, 25]. A third mutation has been reported in sporadic and familial patients with isolated TSH deficiency from different ethnic origins (C105V/114X) [24, 26]. The G29R mutation disrupts heterodimerization with the α-chain and the C105V/114X mutation destroys a disulfide bond essential for normal protein conformation and bioactivity [23, 24].

**Hormone synthesis defects at the level of thyroid follicular cells**

**Resistance to thyrotropin**

The response to bioactive TSH may be impaired at the level of the thyroid follicular cells. Total insensitivity to TSH results in a small hypoplastic thyroid gland and reduced synthesis and secretion of thyroid hormones. Notably, a similar morphologic and biochemical phenotype may occur in patients with mutations in PAX8 [1]. In partial resistance, TSH is elevated, but the peripheral hormone levels are normal, a constellation referred to as euthyroid hyperthyrotropinemia [27]. The size of the thyroid is normal or enlarged. This phenotype can be caused by defects in the TSH receptor or elements of its signaling cascade [28, 29]. Homozygous or compound heterozygous inactivating mutations in the TSH receptor have been found in several patients with resistance to TSH and in the thoroughly characterized *hyt/hyt* mouse that is severely hypothyroid and has a normally located, hypoplastic gland [30]. Unresponsiveness to TSH also can be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait, but the molecular defect remains to be defined [31].

Patients with pseudohypoparathyroidism Ia (PHP Ia), who by definition have resistance to parathyroid hormone (PTH), may also be unresponsive to TSH, LH and FSH [32, 33]. Unresponsiveness to these hormones is the consequence of mutations in the Gsα subunit that transmits the signals of the respective seven transmembrane receptors. In addition to the clinical and biochemical features related to hormone resistance, these patients have characteristic skeletal and developmental abnormalities

**Genetic defects in thyroid hormone synthesis Gillam and Kopp 367**

such as short stature, brachydactyly, and ectopic calcifications (Albright hereditary osteodystrophy) [32, 33].

**Sodium-iodide symporter**

Normal iodide uptake at the basolateral membrane by the perchlorate-sensitive sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) is a rate-limiting step in thyroid hormone synthesis (Fig. 1) [3, 34, 35]. After the cloning of the NIS gene, several homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations have been identified in individuals with hypothyroidism caused by iodine trapping defects [3]. Most patients with iodide trapping defects have a diffuse or nodular goiter, little or no uptake of radioiodide, and a decreased saliva to serum radioiodine ratio. In children, the thyroid may be initially of normal size only to enlarge later in life.

The precise molecular mechanisms by which NIS mutations directly cause iodide transport defects have been identified in a subset of cases. The T354P mutation, an alteration that has been found in several patients from Japan, causes NIS to lose its functional ability to transport iodide [3]. In contrast, the functional defects of two other NIS mutations (Q267E, S515X) are the consequence of defective cellular trafficking and failure of the mutant proteins to reach the plasma membrane [36].

**Thyroperoxidase**

Thyroperoxidase is a glycosylated hemoprotein that catalyzes several pivotal reactions necessary for thyroid hormone synthesis, in particular the iodination of tyrosine residues in TG, and the coupling of iodinated tyrosines to generate T4 and T3 (Fig. 1). Thyroperoxidase defects are among the most frequent causes of inborn abnormalities of thyroid hormone synthesis. Caused by the defective organification of iodide, these patients typically have a significant discharge of radioiodine after the administration of perchlorate. Mutations in the TPO gene have been reported in numerous families with a partial or total organification defect [37–40]. In a recent survey from the Netherlands, Bakker *et al.* summarized their clinical and molecular studies in 45 patients with total iodide organification defects (TIOD) [40]. Although the overall incidence of congenital hypothyroidism in this country is ~1:3,000, TIOD is thought to occur in ~1:66,000. Thirty-five of the 45 patients were available for molecular studies; 13 of 35 patients were homozygous and 16 of 35 patients were compound heterozygous for mutations affecting the exons or intron-exon boundaries of the *TPO* gene. In 4 of 35 families, only one affected allele could be identified; in one of the families, no mutation could be detected, and one patient had a partial maternal isodisomy of chromosome 2p, resulting in homozygosity for an inactivating *TPO* gene mutation [40, 41]. These findings support the notion that nearly all patients with TIOD harbor inactivating mutations in the *TPO* gene.

368 Endocrinology and metabolism

### Hydrogen peroxide
Hydrogen peroxide is an essential factor in the iodination and coupling reactions (Fig. 1). The precise nature of the NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme system generating H₂O₂ is still ill defined. Recently, two NADPH oxidases that may be part of this system have been cloned [6, 7]. They are referred to as THOX1 and THOX2 (alternative designations LNOX1/DUOX2 and p138tox/LNOX2/DUOX2). The two genes are closely linked and located on chromosome 15q15. Immunohistochemical analyzes demonstrate protein expression at the apical membrane of thyrocytes.

Individuals with euthyroid goiter and abnormal iodide organification, possibly caused by a defective H₂O₂ generation, have been reported [42, 43]. Addition of an H₂O₂-generating system to thyroid homogenates or slices from these patients restored normal organification *in vitro*. In two siblings with hypothyroidism, goiter, and iodine organification defects, nearly undetectable thyroid NADPH oxidase activities were measured in tissue slices [44]. It has been proposed that the cause of the organification defect in these patients is the result of impaired Ca²⁺/NAD(P)H-dependent H₂O₂ generation.

### Thyroglobulin
Thyroglobulin is a further key element in hormone synthesis and in the storage of iodine and thyroid hormone. The TG gene is very large, spanning more than 300 kb. It has been mapped to chromosome 8q24, is thought to contain more than 48 exons, and has an open reading frame of 8307 bp (2748 amino acids) [45]. Thyroglobulin is glycosylated, and the mature protein is formed by two noncovalent subunits. Thyroglobulin contains 67 tyrosines, but only a minority of these residues, localized in the carboxy- and aminoterminus, are hormogenic sites. Complete hydrolysis of iodinated TG yields only 2 to 4 molecules of the iodothyronines T4 and T3 [46] (Fig. 1).

Defects of TG synthesis or secretion have been studied in several animal models and human patients [47]. Low or borderline TG concentrations may indicate a quantitative defect, whereas patients with qualitative defects may have normal or even elevated TG levels. In other instances, alterations in the TG gene cause a defective export from thyroid follicular cells or defects in its secondary modifications. In some individuals with a structurally abnormal TG, the coupling of iodotyrosines may be impaired, and most iodine bound to TG is present in the form of MIT and DIT. Unless treated with levothyroxine, these patients typically present with goiter in early childhood. The metabolic status is variable, and, depending on the severity of the defect, the patients are hypothyroid, subclinically hypothyroid, or euthyroid. The radioiodine uptake is elevated. Thyroglobulin defects usually are transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner; however, an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance has been proposed in one kindred [48].

Molecular analysis of several TG mutations found in patients with congenital hypothyroidism reveal that at least some of these alterations result in a secretory defect and thus an endoplasmic reticulum storage disease [49–52]. This also is illustrated by two rodent models that provided important insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with Tg mutations [53–55]. The recessive *cog/cog* mouse has congenital hypothyroidism with goiter. These mice are able to synthesize a full-length Tg molecule, which undergoes normal N-linked glycosylation and glucose trimming. However, a missense mutation in the acetylcholinesterase-like domain of Tg (L2663P) disrupts the tertiary structure of the molecule [53]. The defective folding of the Tg monomer results in abnormal homodimerization, and the protein fails to reach the Golgi complex and accumulates in the endoplasmic reticulum [53]. In contrast to the goitrous hypothyroidism present in the *cog/cog* mouse and certain human counterparts, the recessive dwarf *rdw/rdw* rat displays a nongoitrous form of congenital primary hypothyroidism [54, 55]. The *rdw/rdw* rat also has a missense mutation in the *Tg* gene replacing a highly conserved amino acid (G2320R) [54, 55]. As in the *cog/cog* mouse, the mutated Tg shows a severe defect in export with retention inside the endoplasmic reticulum, but, for reasons that are not entirely clear, there is no goitrous enlargement of the thyroid. The identification of a mutation in the *Tg* gene as a cause of nongoitrous hypothyroidism in the *rdw/rdw* rat is important because it challenges the previously held generalization that nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism in humans is caused by thyroid dysgenesis or defects in TSH signaling. The findings in the *rdw/rdw* rat suggest that a subset of patients with dyshormonogenesis also may present with nongoitrous congenital hypothyroidism.

### Dehalogenase
After entering the follicular cell, TG is hydrolyzed, and T4 and T3 are secreted into the blood at the basolateral membrane (Fig. 1). The iodotyrosines MIT and DIT, which are much more abundant in the TG molecule, are de-iodinated by an intrathyroidal dehalogenase and recycled for hormone synthesis. In cases where the dehalogenase system is defective, MIT and DIT leak into the circulation and are excreted in the urine. This leads to severe iodine loss, and if iodine supply is scarce, goiter and hypothyroidism may ensue [56]. Intrathyroidal dehalogenase has not been characterized in further detail.

Clinically, patients with a de-iodinase defect typically present with congenital hypothyroidism and a goitrous gland [56]. The diagnosis can be established formally by administration of radiolabeled DIT. Normally, DIT is de-iodinated, whereas in the case of a defective dehalogenase, DIT is excreted unchanged.
logenase, the majority is secreted unaltered in the urine. Administration of iodide in sufficient amounts to compensate for the increased loss will re-establish an euthyroid metabolic state. The disorder is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion.

### Pendrin

Pendred syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder traditionally defined by the triad of congenital deafness, goiter, and a partially positive perchlorate test [57]. The partial discharge of radioiodine after the administration of perchlorate indicates that the gland has an impaired ability to organify iodide. Pendred syndrome is caused by mutations in the *PDS* gene, which encodes a novel anion transporter, pendrin [58]. Mutations in the *PDS* gene also form the molecular basis of two nonsyndromic variants of Pendred syndrome: nonsyndromic autosomal recessive deafness DFNB4 and nonsyndromic familial enlarged vestibular aqueduct [5]. Pendrin is predominantly expressed in thyroid follicular cells, the inner ear, and the kidney. In thyrocytes, pendrin is located at the apical membrane where it may function as a transporter of iodide into the follicular lumen [59] (Fig. 1). In the kidney, it has been shown to act as a chloride–base exchanger [60, 61]. In the inner ear, pendrin may also exert a role as an anion transporter, but its exact function is unknown.

Among patients with Pendred syndrome, the degree of thyroid enlargement is highly variable within and between families. This variability may depend on the degree of loss of function caused by the mutation or by nutritional iodide intake. Notably, most individuals with Pendred syndrome are euthyroid despite the impaired incorporation of iodide. This observation indicates that iodide can cross into the follicular lumen by means of other transporters or by diffusion.

The most prominent and disabling feature of Pendred syndrome is profound sensorineural hearing impairment [62]. Individuals with Pendred syndrome display an enlargement of the vestibular aqueducts and the endolymphatic system [62, 63]. Similar pathologic findings have been shown in mice with targeted disruption of the *Pds* gene [64]. *Pds-/-* mice develop early-onset complete deafness and exhibit signs of vestibular dysfunction. The inner ears of these mice develop normally until E 15, at which time the endolymphatic ducts and sacs dilate, most likely as a consequence of a defect in anion and fluid transport. In addition, the sensory cells degenerate and the otoconia become destroyed or malformed. Thyroid hormone levels are normal in *Pds-/-* mice studied up to age two years; it is unknown whether they have a partial organification defect [64].

### Genetic defects resulting in hyperthyroidism

Chronic stimulation of the cAMP cascade results in enhanced proliferation and function of thyroid follicular cells [66] (Fig. 1). Constitutively activating mutations in the stimulatory G protein subunit Gsα and the TSH receptor may therefore result in hyperthyroidism. These gain of function mutations are dominant, and one mutated allele is thus sufficient to result in disease [29, 65].

#### Gsα and thyrotropin receptor mutations in toxic adenomas and carcinomas

Somatic mutations in the stimulatory Gsα subunit (*gsp* mutations) lead to the development of toxic adenomas. Identical mutations also have been found in a subset of nonfunctioning adenomas and differentiated thyroid carcinomas [67]. Gsα mutations impair the hydrolysis of GTP to GDP, resulting in persistent activation of adenyl cyclase. Identical Gsα mutations are found in 35 to 40% of somatotroph tumors in acromegalic patients. Mosaicism for Gsα mutations that occur early in development cause McCune Albright syndrome and may affect multiple tissues, including the thyroid [68].

Analogous to somatic mutations in Gsα, somatic mutations in the TSH receptor result in clonal proliferation of thyrocytes and toxic adenomas [69]. The first identified mutations were clustered in the third intracellular loop and the sixth transmembrane domain of the receptor, but a wide variety of activating somatic mutations have been found in subsequent studies [65, 70, 71]. Somatic TSH receptor mutations also have been identified in toxic adenomas isolated from multinodular goiters [72] and in autoradiographically hyperfunctioning areas of goiters from euthyroid patients. The latter finding indicates that small hyperfunctioning zones are early stages in the development of hyperfunctioning adenomas [73].

All reported gain of function mutations in the TSH receptor increase basal cAMP levels, but only a few amino acid substitutions also activate the PLC cascade in a constitutive manner [65] (Fig. 1). In well-differentiated thyroid cancers, mutations in the TSH receptor occur only rarely [74–76]. Mutations found in these cancers activate both the cAMP and the PLC pathway, suggesting that concomitant activation of the two signaling cascades may promote transformation.

#### Germline mutations in familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism

In autosomal dominant familial hyperthyroidism, the typical signs associated with autoimmune hyperthyroidism (such as autoantibodies and endocrine ophthalmopathy) are absent [77]. These patients present with a diffuse goiter because all thyroid follicular cells grow at an increased rate. The molecular basis of inherited nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism was elucidated through the
370 Endocrinology and metabolism

detection of activating germline mutations in the TSH receptor in several families [29, 65, 78]. Interestingly, amino acid substitutions found in familial nonautoimmune hyperthyroidism are distinct from the mutations detected in sporadic germline mutations, and hereditary mutations generally are associated with a milder phenotype [29]. The onset of hyperthyroidism may vary in carriers of the same mutation within a given kindred, and it is thought that genetic background or iodine intake modulate the phenotypic expression.

**Sporadic germline mutations in congenital hyperthyroidism**

Congenital hyperthyroidism usually is caused by transplacental passage of stimulating TSH receptor autoantibodies. In these patients, the hyperthyroid state is transient and resolves within the first three to seven months as the maternal antibodies are cleared from the circulation. Only rarely does congenital hyperthyroidism have a nonautoimmune cause. In these patients, hyperthyroidism is persistent and typically of severe nature. Constitutively activating *de novo* germline mutations of the TSH receptor have been identified in several patients with this form of congenital hyperthyroidism [29, 65, 79]. A toxic adenoma harboring a somatic TSH receptor mutation was reported as another unusual cause of congenital hyperthyroidism [80].

The differentiation of nonautoimmune congenital hyperthyroidism from the much more frequent and transient autoimmune form is of clinical importance because it necessitates a more aggressive therapeutic approach that includes surgery or ablative radiotherapy.

**Hypersensitivity to human chorionic gonadotropin caused by mutation of the thyrotropin receptor**

Gestational hyperthyroidism can be caused by high concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) crossreacting with the TSH receptor. A remarkable variant of familial gestational hyperthyroidism has been identified [81]. The patient, as well as her mother, had a history of repeated miscarriages and pregnancies that were complicated by significant hyperemesis. Direct analysis of the TSH receptor gene in the proband and her mother revealed the presence of a heterozygous point mutation that resulted in the substitution of one amino acid (K183R). Functional studies revealed that this alteration in the TSH receptor confers hypersensitivity to hCG, thus providing an explanation for the recurrent hyperthyroidism in early pregnancy in these individuals [81].

**Perspective**

In addition to a better understanding of thyroid pathophysiology and the possibility of genetic testing in selected cases, the characterization of proteins involved in thyroid hormone biosynthesis has had unexpected ramifications. For example, expression of functional NIS has been reported in numerous other tissues, and it mediates active iodide transport in the lactating, but not in the nonlactating, mammary gland [3, 82]. NIS expression has been documented in breast cancer tissue [82]. Gene therapy with NIS and subsequent radioiodine therapy have been successful in several tumors *in vitro* [83]. NIS expression under the control of tissue-specific promoters, such as the prostate-specific-antigen promoter, may become an effective strategy in the therapy of selected cancers *in vivo* [84]. The study of pendrin continues to provide surprising insights into the physiology of the thyroid and also the inner ear and the kidney. These examples illustrate that the study of inborn errors of metabolism continues to be an informative approach in the quest for a more complete understanding of the genetic control of thyroid ontogeny, differentiation, and cellular functions. In addition, they provide the basis for the development of novel strategies to prevent or treat human disease.

This study reports on the identification of a novel cause for combined pituitary hormone deficiency. Homozygosity for LHX3 mutations leads to hormone deficiency of all hormones of the adenohypophysis with the exception of ACTH. In addition, these patients have a rigid cervical spine and a limited ability to rotate the head.

These authors screened 228 patients with a broad spectrum of congenital pituitary defects, ranging in severity from isolated growth hormone deficiency to septo-optic dysplasia with panhypopituitarism. Three different heterozygous missense mutations were detected in individuals with variable hormone deficiencies and mild forms of pituitary malformations. The phenotype among heterozygous family members was found to be variable. In contrast to the pronounced phenotype associated with homozygous HESX1 mutations (21), the study provides evidence that haploinsufficiency for HESX1 causes a partial phenotype.

The TSHβ mutation found in this study has been reported in other kindreds from Brazil and Europe (24). Although a founder effect cannot be formally excluded, it is possible that this mutation is independently recurrent. The two other mutations in the TSHβ gene (23, 25) have been found in several families as a consequence of a founder effect.

In this large inbred pedigree, two TPO mutations were co-segregating. Affected individuals were either homozygous for one of these mutations, or compound heterozygous. The study is of conceptual interest because initial linkage analyzes, assuming a model with a single mutation, were not conclusive.

The molecular characterization of 35 families with a total iodide organification defect led to the detection of structural defects in at least one allele of the TPO gene in 34 families from the Netherlands. This finding indicates that most patients with TIOD do indeed have mutations in the TPO gene.

Using a genetic approach, the authors show that the rdw/rw locus corresponds to the rat Tg locus. This led to the identification of the Tg mutation in this animal model of non-goitrous hypothyroidism.

Using a RT-PCR approach, these authors also characterized the rdw/rdw rat. In addition, functional characterization of the mutant Tg in transfected cells showed no detectable Tg in the secreted media, indicating a severe defect in the export of the mutant protein.

Endocrinology 2000, 141:839–845. Immunohistochemical studies show that pendrin is located at the apical membrane of thyrocytes. Together with results obtained in oocytes showing chloride and iodide uptake, these findings suggests that pendrin could be involved in the transport of iodide into the follicular lumen.

60 Soleimani M, Greeley T, Petrovic S, et al.: Pendrin: an apical Cl-/OH-/HCO3-exchanger in the kidney cortex. Am J Physiol Renal Physiol 2001, 280:F356–F364. Pendrin was found to be expressed in the cortical collecting duct and the proximal tubule by nephron-segment-specific RT-PCR. Western blot analysis of membrane preparations indicate that pendrin is located in the apical membrane. Functional studies in transfected cells show that pendrin is an exchanger of chloride with hydroxide, bicarbonate, or formate. In summary, the authors propose that pendrin is a renal chloride-base exchanger.

61 Royaux IE, Wall SM, Karniski LP, et al.: Pendrin, encoded by the Pendred syndrome gene, resides in the apical region of renal intercalated cells and mediates bicarbonate secretion. Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 2001, 98:4221–4226. Consistent with findings in transfected cells (60), this study, using Pds-/– mice as model, shows pendrin expression in intercalated cells located in the cortical collecting duct as an exchanger of chloride and bicarbonate.

This study presents the murine knockout model of the Pds gene. Mice homozygous for a disrupted Pds gene are deaf and have vestibular dysfunctions. Although the inner ear is formed normally at birth, the endolymphatic ducts and sacs then dilate, most likely as a consequence of a defect in anion and fluid transport. Thyroid hormone concentrations are normal in Pds-/– mice studied up to age two years.

Small, autonomously functioning zones from goiters obtained from euthyroid patients were isolated and screened for activating TSH receptor mutations. A subset of these microscopic lesions did indeed have gain of function mutations in the receptor indicating that these small clonal zones reflect early stages in the development of hyperfunctioning adenomas.

The study shows that NIS is expressed in the mammary gland. NIS mediates active iodide transport in healthy lactating (but not in nonlactating) mammary gland and in mammary tumors. Human breast cancer samples also express the symporter. These results indicate that the mammary gland NIS may be an essential breast cancer marker and the authors suggest that radioiodide may be useful in the diagnosis and treatment of breast cancer.

The human prostate adenocarcinoma cell line LNCaP was stably transfected with NIS cDNA under the control of the prostate-specific antigen promoter. Treatment with 131Iodide was able to reduce the mass of xenografts consisting of these cells in athymic nude mice. This study shows the potential of NIS, under the control of a tissue-specific promoter, as a novel therapeutic gene for non-thyroidal cancers.
