ABSTRACT

In the nucleus of differentiated osteoblasts, the alpha chain of nascent polypeptide associated complex (αNAC) interacts with cJUN transcription factors to regulate the expression of target genes, including *Osteocalcin* (*Bglap2*). PTH induces the phosphorylation of αNAC on serine 99 through a Gas-PKA dependent pathway. This leads to activation of αNAC and expression of *Bglap2*. To identify additional target genes regulated by PTH-activated αNAC, we performed ChIP-Seq against αNAC in PTH-treated MC3T3-E1 cells. This identified *Low density lipoprotein receptor-Related Protein 6 (Lrp6)* as a potential αNAC target. LRP6 acts as a co-receptor for the PTH receptor to allow optimal activation of PTH signaling. PTH increased *Lrp6* mRNA levels in primary osteoblasts. Conventional quantitative ChIP confirmed the ChIP-Seq results. To assess whether αNAC plays a critical role in PTH-stimulated *Lrp6* expression, we knocked-down *Naca* expression in MC3T3-E1 cells. Reduction of αNAC levels decreased basal expression of *Lrp6* by 30% and blocked the stimulation of *Lrp6* expression by PTH. We cloned the proximal mouse *Lrp6* promoter (−2523/+120 bp) upstream of the luciferase reporter. Deletion and point mutations analysis in electrophoretic mobility shift assays and transient transfections identified a functional αNAC binding site centered around −343 bp. ChIP and ChIP-reChIP against JUND and αNAC showed that they cohabit on the proximal *Lrp6* promoter. Luciferase assays confirmed that PTH-activated αNAC potentiated JUND-mediated *Lrp6* transcription and *JunD* knockdown abolished this response. This study identified a novel αNAC target gene induced downstream of PTH signaling and represents the first characterization of the regulation of *Lrp6* transcription in osteoblasts.

1. Introduction

Continuous infusion of Parathyroid Hormone (PTH) promotes calcium and phosphorus release by activating osteoclast-mediated resorption of bone [1,2]. However, intermittent administration of PTH at a low dosage promotes bone formation [3–5]. Intermittent PTH (iPTH) dosing leads to an increase in osteoblast number caused by exit of osteoprogenitors from the cell cycle, which promotes their differentiation into bone-forming cells [6–8]. Concomitantly, the hormone activates survival signaling in osteoblasts and delays apoptosis [9]. Thus iPTH treatment causes pleiotropic effects that all contribute to increase osteoblast number.

PTH signals in cells by activating the Parathyroid Hormone Receptor 1 (PTH1R), a seven-transmembrane domain G protein-coupled receptor [10]. Optimal activation of PTH1R by PTH involves its interaction with the Low density lipoprotein receptor-Related Protein 6 (LRP6) [11–14]. When *Lrp6* expression is disrupted in mice, the anabolic action of iPTH is blunted [12].

Following receptor engagement, the biological effect of PTH is mediated through signaling cascades and downstream targets controlling proliferation, maturation, and differentiation events. Because of its clinical relevance, extensive work has been performed to uncover the key signaling pathways modulated by PTH. Results from numerous studies suggest that multiple signal transduction pathways act in parallel or synergistically to achieve the full anabolic response to iPTH treatment (reviewed in [10,15]).

We have characterized one of these signaling cascade that initiates with PTH binding to its receptor, activation of Ga<sub>s</sub> to stimulate cAMP

accumulation and PKA activity, and phosphorylation of the transcriptional coregulator αNAC to send it to the nucleus where it affects target gene transcription to regulate bone mass [16]. αNAC (alpha chain of the nascent polypeptide associated complex, encoded by the *Naca* gene) shuttles to the nucleus where it can positively or negatively regulate gene transcription during mesenchymal cell differentiation through differential interaction with histones deacetylases (HDAC) corepressor molecules [17–19]. In the nucleus of differentiated osteoblasts, αNAC associates with transcription factors such as cJUN to regulate the expression of target genes, including Osteocalcin (*Bglap2*) [17, 19, 20]. αNAC can specifically bind DNA [21] and we have shown that the potentiation of cJUN-dependent transcription of the *Bglap2* gene by αNAC requires its binding to the *Bglap2* promoter [17]. The αNAC protein is extensively post-translationally modified by phosphorylation events that regulate its half-life, subcellular localization, interaction with partner molecules, and activity [16, 22–25].

Treatment of osteoblasts with PTH(1–34) or a PKA-selective activator leads to translocation of αNAC to the nucleus [16]. αNAC is phosphorylated by PKA at residue serine 99 and phospho-S99-αNAC accumulates in the nucleus of osteoblasts exposed to PTH(1–34) but not in treated cells expressing dominant negative PKA. Nuclear accumulation is abrogated by an S99A mutation but enhanced by a phosphomimetic residue (S99D). Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that PTH(1–34) treatment leads to accumulation of αNAC at the *Bglap2* promoter. Altered gene dosage for Gαs and αNAC in compound heterozygous mice results in reduced bone mass, establishing the physiological relevance of this signaling cascade and confirming that Gαs and αNAC form part of a common genetic pathway [16].

To identify additional relevant target genes affected by PTH-mediated αNAC phosphorylation, we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation with deep sequencing (ChIP-Seq) against αNAC in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells treated with vehicle or PTH. This strategy identified the *Lrp6* gene as a novel αNAC target. Our results define the first mechanism for the transcriptional control for *Lrp6*. They also suggest a model through which the iPTH anabolic effect can be maximized.

### 2. Materials and methods

#### 2.1. Cells, antibodies, and reagents

The MC3T3-E1 (subclone 4) osteoblastic cell line [26] (generously provided by Dr. Renny T. Franceschi, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI) was cultured in minimum essential medium alpha (αMEM; Invitrogen, Waltham, MA) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) from HyClone (Logan, UT). The HEK-293 cell line (American Type Culture Collection, Manassas, VA) was cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM; Invitrogen) with the same supplement. Primary osteoblasts were isolated from 5-day-old C57BL/6 mice as previously described [16]. PTH(1–34) (catalog no. H4835) was purchased from Bachem (Torrance, CA) and N⁶-benzoyladenosine cAMP (6Bnz-cAMP; catalog no. B009) was from Biolog (Bremen, Germany). The affinity-purified chicken anti-αNAC [27], the rabbit polyclonal anti-αNAC [21] and the rabbit polyclonal anti-αNAC-phospho-S99 (anti-pS99) [16] antibodies have been previously described. The mouse anti-αTubulin (catalog no. T6074) was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO). The rabbit anti-JUND (catalog no. sc-74) and the naive rabbit IgG were purchased from Santa Cruz Biotechnology (Dallas, TX). The protease inhibitor cocktail (PIC; catalog no. P8340) was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.

#### 2.2. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP sequencing (ChIP-Seq)

Forty million MC3T3-E1 cells treated with vehicle or 100 nM PTH (1–34) were fixed for 10 min at room temperature by adding a concentrated formaldehyde solution directly to the culture media to a final concentration of 1%. For reChIP experiments, 2 mM disuccinimidyl glutarate (DSG) was added to the cells, 35 min before adding the formaldehyde. The cross-linking reaction was stopped by adding 0.125 M glycine for 5 min at room temperature. Fixed cells were washed twice, scraped in cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na₂HPO₄, 1.8 mM KH₂PO₄) and centrifuged for 5 min at 500 g. To isolate the nuclei, cells were successively resuspended and centrifuged in nucleus-chromatin preparation (NCP) buffer 1 (10 mM HEPES, pH 6.5; 10 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 0.25% Triton X-100 [vol/vol]) and NCP buffer 2 (10 mM HEPES, pH 6.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 200 mM NaCl). The nuclear pellet was lysed by resuspension in 1 ml of cold RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% [vol/vol] IGEPAL® CA-630, 0.5% [wt/vol] deoxycholate, 0.1% [wt/vol] SDS, 5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM Na₄P₂O₇, 1 mM β-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na₃VO₄, 1 mM PMSF and 1× PIC). The lysate was sonicated for 24 min using a 1 ml AFA fiber milliTUBE and a Focused-ultra sonicator M220 (Covaris, Woburn, MA) set at 10% duty cycle, 75 watts intensity and 200 cycles per burst. Sonicated lysates were cleaned of debris by centrifugation at 13000 g for 10 min. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was performed during 16 h at 4 °C on a rotating wheel using the rabbit polyclonal anti-αNAC antibody (dilution 1:50), the rabbit polyclonal anti-pS99 antibody (dilution 1:10) or the anti-JUND (3 μg) bound to 1.5 mg of Dynabeads® protein G (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Protein-DNA-bead complexes were successively washed four times with RIPA buffer, four times with lithium chloride buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM LiCl, 1% [vol/vol] IGEPAL® CA-630, 1% [wt/vol] deoxycholate), and one time with 100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0. For reChIP experiment, washed complexes were eluted from the beads by incubating in 50 μl of elution buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM DTT) for 30 min at 37 °C. Following elution, samples were diluted 20× in RIPA buffer and the second ChIP was performed as described above. Following final immunoprecipitation and washing steps, washed complexes were eluted from beads by heating in 150 μl of 1% SDS for 10 min, and cross-links were reversed by heating the samples for 5 h at 65 °C. DNA was purified by phenol-chloroform extraction and precipitated using ethanol and 20 μg of glycogen as a carrier. The chromatin from input and ChIP samples was resuspended in 50 μl of TE (10 mM Tris-HCl, PH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) buffer. *Lrp6* promoter fragments were amplified using 5′-GAAAGCGTAAGCCGCAATG-3′ forward and 5′-GTGGTCGGGACTACTTTCTG-3′ reverse primers and *Bglap2* promoter fragments using previously described primers [17]. Reactions were performed using PowerUP SYBR green master mix following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and carried out in a QuantStudio 7 Flex Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

ChIP-Seq was performed by the Genome Quebec and McGill University Innovation Centre (Montreal, QC, Canada). Briefly, ChIP-Seq libraries from immunoprecipitated DNA were constructed using the TruSeq gDNA library kit from Illumina (San Diego, CA) following the manufacturer's instructions. Single reads of 50 base pairs were obtained using a HiSeq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina).

#### 2.3. RNA isolation, real-time PCR and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)

Prior to RNA isolation, cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS. RNA was isolated using 1 ml of TRIzol reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, ON). Using the high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 1 μg of RNA was reverse-transcribed into cDNA following the manufacturer's instructions. Gene expression was assessed using the TaqMan Universal PCR master mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and with the *Lrp6* (Mm00999795_m1) or *Jund* (Mm04208316_s1) TaqMan assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The β2-microglobulin gene (*B2m*) (Mm00437762_m1) and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase

(Gapdh, for Fig. 6F) (Mm03302249_g1) TaqMan assays (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were used as endogenous reference genes. Reactions were carried out in a 7500 real-time PCR system (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

RNA-Seq was performed by the Genome Quebec and McGill University Innovation Centre. Briefly, RNA-Seq libraries were built with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit from Illumina following the manufacturer's instructions. Pair-end reads of 100 base pairs were obtained on a HiSeq 2000 sequencing system (Illumina). The Cufflinks program was used to assemble aligned RNA-Seq reads into transcripts and to estimate their abundance (FPKM) [28].

### 2.4. Vector cloning

An *Lrp6* promoter fragment (-2523 bp/+120 bp) was amplified from MC3T3-E1 cell genomic DNA. The fragment was subcloned into the pGL4.10[LUC2] vector (Promega, Madison, WI) using *KpnI* and *NheI* restriction sites that were added during the PCR step. Promoter deletions and mutations were generated by PCR and introduced into the pGL4.10[LUC2] vector using the same restriction enzymes. Primer sequences and/or plasmids available upon request.

Vectors expressing the short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting *Naca* (shaNAC.1: 5'-CAAACGTATCAAGAGCAAAGG-3' and shaNAC.2: 5'-TACGAGAGTCACTATCCGAAA-3') were obtained by introducing the shRNA sequence in the pLK0.1 vector (plasmid #10878; Addgene, Cambridge, MA) as previously described [29]. The shRNAs targeting *Jund* (shJunD.1, TRC no. 0000042704; shJunD.2, TRC no. 0000042706) and the non-targeted control shRNA (shNT; catalog no. SHC016) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich.

### 2.5. Infection with lentiviral vectors

Lentiviral particles were obtained by transfecting HEK-293 cells with 10 μg of shRNA-expressing vector, 2.5 μg of pMD2.G (viral envelope encoding vector, a gift from Dr. Didier Trono; Addgene plasmid #12259) and 7.5 μg psPAX2 (viral packaging vector, a gift from Dr. Didier Trono; Addgene plasmid #12260) using the calcium/phosphate DNA-precipitation technique [30]. Forty-eight (48) h post-transfection, the media containing viral particles was filtered using a 0.45 μm filter (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Lentivirus-enriched media was completed with 4 μg/ml hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich) and transferred onto MC3T3-E1 cells or primary cultures of osteoblasts. Twenty-four (24) h post-infection, 5 μg/ml puromycin was added to the infected cells and selection was performed for 72 h.

### 2.6. Luciferase assay

Sixteen (16) h before transfection, \(6 \times 10^5\) MC3T3-E1 cells were seeded in 12-well plates. In each well, 400 ng of *Lrp6* promoter reporter vector and 25 ng of Renilla luciferase internal control vector (pRL-SV40, Promega) were transfected using 5 μl of Lipofectamine LTX and 1 μl of PLUS reagent following the manufacturer's instructions (Invitrogen). Where mentioned, 100 ng of JUND- or αNAC-expressing vector was co-transfected. Forty-eight (48) h post-transfection, the cells were washed 3 times with cold PBS and lysed in 200 μl of 1× Passive lysis buffer (Promega). Luciferase assays were performed on 20 μl of cell lysate with the Dual-luciferase reporter assay system from Promega. Firefly and Renilla luciferase counts were measured during 10 s on a SIRIUS luminometer from Berthold (Bad Wildbad, Germany). Results were calculated by normalizing Firefly relative light units to Renilla relative light units and are expressed as fold-change over the empty vector.

### 2.7. Electrophoresis mobility shift assay (EMSA)

A confluent 10 cm tissue culture dish of HEK-293 cells was treated for 1 h with 100 μm 6Bnz-cAMP to induce phosphorylation of αNAC at residue Serine 99 and nuclear translocation [16]. Cells were allowed to detach by incubation in PBS supplemented with 10 mM EDTA for 20 min on a shaker. The cells were then spun and nuclear extracts were prepared by incubating the pellet in 800 μl of buffer A (10 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 10 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 0.625% IGEPAL® CA-630, 1 mM PMSF, 1× PIC) on ice for 15 min. The cells were vortexed for 10 s and centrifuged for 90 s at 11,000 rpm. The pellet, containing the nuclei, was resuspended in 150 μl of buffer B (20 mM Tris, pH 7.9, 400 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 1× PIC) and incubated for 20 min at 4°C on a rotating wheel. Buffer B-containing nuclei were next centrifuged at 16,000 g for 90 s at 4°C. The supernatant corresponding to the nuclear extract was aliquoted and stored at -80°C.

Oligonucleotide probes spanning the αNAC binding site (αNACbds) within the *Lrp6* promoter region (-346/-328 bp; 5'-CGGGACGCAGA AAGTAGTC-3') or the positive control αNACbds from the Myoglobin promoter region (5'-AGGGCCAGAGAAAGACA-3') [21] were synthesized with a GG overhang. The probes were ³²P-labeled using [α-³²P]-dCTP (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA) and Klenow DNA Polymerase I (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).

DNA-proteins complexes were allowed to form by incubating labeled probes with 2 μg of nuclear extracts and 20 μl of binding buffer [25 mM Tris pH 7.9, 12 mM MgCl₂, 10 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 2 μg poly(dI-dC), 40 ng/μl BSA, 4% Ficoll] for 30 min on ice. For supershifting, naive chicken IgY or the chicken anti-αNAC antibody [27] were added to the binding reaction for 15 min prior to the addition of the labeled probe. DNA-proteins complexes were separated on a native 6% polyacrylamide gel (Acrylamide:Bis 19:1) in 0.25× TBE (22.25 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 22.25 mM boric acid, 0.5 mM EDTA) at 200 V during 2 h. The gel was dried and DNA-proteins complexes were revealed by autoradiography on X-ray film.

### 2.8. Statistical analysis

Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance with *post hoc* tests except for Fig. 1B and C where unpaired *t*-tests were used. A probability (*P*) value lower than 0.05 was accepted as significant.

## 3. Results

### 3.1. αNAC binds to the proximal *Lrp6* promoter

We previously showed that stimulation of osteoblasts by PTH(1-34) induces αNAC Serine 99 phosphorylation, its nuclear translocation and its recruitment to the *Bglap2* promoter [16]. With the goal to identify other genes that are directly regulated by PTH-activated αNAC and are important for iPTH-dependent bone anabolism, we performed an αNAC ChIP-Seq on MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells stimulated with 100 nM PTH (1-34) for 30 min. In parallel, to establish a list of genes directly regulated by PTH we performed RNA-Seq on PTH(1-34)-stimulated MC3T3-E1 cells. This strategy identified a limited number of significant peaks when compared to the ChIP-Seq performed using naive IgG (data not shown) suggesting that PTH-activated αNAC transcriptional targets are not abundant. One of these significant peaks corresponded to the proximal promoter (nucleotides -541 to -293 relative to the annotated transcription initiation site) of *Lrp6* (Fig. 1A). RNA-Seq performed on MC3T3-E1 cells stimulated for 60 min with 10⁻⁷ M PTH (1-34) showed a 2-fold increase in *Lrp6* transcript levels compared to vehicle-treated cells (Fig. 1B) and treatment of cultures of primary osteoblasts with the hormone under the same conditions also induced *Lrp6* mRNA expression (Fig. 1C). These results show that *Lrp6* is a gene directly regulated by PTH in osteoblasts. We interpret the data to mean that αNAC is involved in the stimulation of *Lrp6* expression following PTH(1-34) treatment of osteoblast through direct binding to its promoter.

To validate the ChIP-Seq results we performed a conventional ChIP against αNAC on MC3T3-E1 cells stimulated with PTH(1-34) or vehicle

**Fig. 1. ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq identify Lrp6 as a potential αNAC target gene downstream from PTH treatment.** (A) Representative profile of peaks (bracketed) obtained on the *Lrp6* gene by ChIP-Seq.

under the same conditions. The previously characterized αNAC target gene, *Bglap2*, served as a positive control in the conventional ChIP. Results show that following 30 min of stimulation with 100 nM PTH (1–34), αNAC immunoprecipitation enriched the αNAC-bound *Bglap2* promoter fragment by 2.5-fold when compared to vehicle-treated cells or the negative control ChIP performed with naive IgG (*Fig. 2A*). We next performed amplification of the *Lrp6* promoter region corresponding to the peak identified by ChIP-Seq. Using pan-specific anti-αNAC antibodies, results show that αNAC immunoprecipitation significantly enriched the promoter of *Lrp6* in vehicle-treated MC3T3-E1 cells when compared to the ChIP performed using naive IgG (*Fig. 2B*). However, stimulation by PTH(1–34) for 30 min did not further increase the enrichment when compared to vehicle (*Fig. 2B*). This agrees with the detection of a peak of corresponding intensity when comparing vehicle- and PTH-treated samples in the ChIP-Seq data (*Fig. 1A*). We have previously shown that other post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation on residue Ser43 downstream from Integrin Linked Kinase, can control the subcellular shuttling of αNAC [27], and other types of processing could direct the coregulator to the nuclear compartment. We thus interpret the results of *Fig. 2B* to mean that non-PTH-activated nuclear αNAC can occupy its binding site within the *Lrp6* proximal promoter when cells are not stimulated by the hormone. Treatment with PTH activates αNAC through phosphorylation of residue serine 99 (αNAC-pS99) [16]. To investigate if the αNAC-pS99 form preferentially binds the promoter of *Lrp6* following PTH stimulation, we performed conventional ChIP using the previously characterized anti-pS99 antibody [16]. Results show that a 30 min stimulation of

the MC3T3-E1 cells with 100 nM PTH(1–34) followed by immunoprecipitation of activated αNAC-pS99 significantly enriched the bound *Lrp6* promoter fragment when compared to vehicle-treated cells (*Fig. 2C*). Taken together, these results confirm that αNAC is recruited to the *Lrp6* promoter but suggest a different mechanism of transcriptional regulation when compared to the *Bglap2* gene.

### 3.2. Knock-down of αNAC decreases the expression of *Lrp6*

We used RNA interference-mediated knockdown with two different short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) targeting *Naca* (shaNAC.1 and shaNAC.2) in order to validate the role of αNAC in *Lrp6* gene regulation. Immunoblotting against αNAC confirmed the efficacy of the shRNAs: αNAC protein expression was inhibited in MC3T3-E1 cells stably expressing either shaNAC.1 or shaNAC.2, compared to cells stably expressing a non-targeted shRNA (shNT) (*Fig. 3A*). The impact of αNAC suppression on *Lrp6* expression was then measured using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR on mRNA isolated from the stably transfected cell populations. When αNAC expression was reduced in MC3T3-E1 cells, we measured a significant 30% reduction of basal *Lrp6* expression (*Fig. 3B*, gray bars). As expected, stimulation of shNT-expressing MC3T3-E1 cells with PTH(1–34) for 60 min increased *Lrp6* mRNA expression (*Fig. 3B*). However, PTH-induced stimulation of *Lrp6* was abrogated in shaNAC-expressing cells (*Fig. 3B*). These results show that αNAC is involved in both basal and PTH-stimulated *Lrp6* transcription.

### 3.3. The Lrp6 promoter contains an αNAC binding site

We inserted a fragment from the Lrp6 gene corresponding to nucleotides -2523 to +120 bp (-2523/+120 bp) relative to the annotated transcription start site into the pGL4.10[LUC2] reporter vector. When transfected into MC3T3-E1 cells, the -2523/+120 bp fragment directed a high level of transcription of the luciferase reporter (Fig. 4A). To identify sequences involved in Lrp6 promoter basal activity we

Knock-down of αNAC decreases the expression of Lrp6.** MC3T3-E1 cell populations stably expressing shRNAs targeting Naca (shαNAC.1 and shαNAC.2) or non-targeted shRNA (shNT) as control were generated by lentiviral infection.

performed a series of nested deletions starting from the 5' end of the -2523/+120 bp fragment. Deletion of Lrp6 promoter sequence between positions -2523 to -352 did not affect promoter activity (Fig. 4A; compare promoter fragments -2523/+120 bp, -997/+120 bp, -407/+120 bp and -352/+120 bp). However, further deletion of nucleotides located between position -352 and -242 completely abrogated Lrp6 promoter activity, suggesting that this region contains critical response elements to maintain basal Lrp6 expression (Fig. 4A; compare promoter fragments -352/+120 bp and -242/+120 bp). Interestingly, this critical region (-352/-242 bp) corresponds to part of the peak identified by the ChIP-Seq analysis (Fig. 4B), supporting the notion that this region contains a functional binding site for αNAC.

The αNAC protein contains a characterized DNA binding domain that mediates its specific interaction with a loose consensus sequence centered around 5'-g/cCAg/cA-3' [21]. In silico analysis of the Lrp6 promoter region between nucleotides -1000 and +120 using MatInspector software [31] identified two potential αNAC binding sites (αNACbds). The proximal site is located between nucleotides -340 and -331 and the distal one between nucleotides -376 and -367 relative to the annotated transcription initiation site (Fig. 4B). Deletion of the 5'-flanking region of Lrp6 up to -352 bp upstream of the start site (Fig. 4A) did not affect promoter activity, suggesting that only the

Highlighted are two putative αNAC binding sites (αNACbds) identified using MatInspector (Genomatix software suite). (C) Cross-species alignment of the proximal αNACbds located from nucleotide −340 to −331 of the mouse *Lrp6* promoter. Asterisks show conserved nucleotides through species. (D) Autoradiograph of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) performed using a probe containing the αNACbds sequence present in the Myoglobin (lanes 1 to 4) or the *Lrp6* promoter (lanes 5 to 8). Probes were incubated with nuclear extracts (NE) proteins from HEK293 cells treated with 6Bnz-cAMP to induce αNAC nuclear translocation or with binding buffer as negative control. Super shift (SS; top arrow) was performed by adding anti-αNAC or naive, non-specific (NS) IgY to the binding reactions.

proximal αNACbds is critical for *Lrp6* regulation.

Biologically relevant sequences for DNA-binding factors show species conservation. Alignment of the *Lrp6* promoter region from different vertebrate species shows that the proximal αNAC binding site and flanking nucleotides are located within a conserved genomic region through vertebrates (Fig. 4C). In order to confirm that αNAC interacts with the proximal αNACbds located within the *Lrp6* promoter we next performed an electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) using a probe corresponding to the *Lrp6* αNACbds. The previously characterized αNACbds from the Myoglobin gene [21] served as a positive control in these experiments. Incubation of both probes with nuclear extracts proteins from HEK293 cells treated with 6Bnz-cAMP to induce αNAC nuclear translocation [16] lead to the formation of protein-DNA complexes (Fig. 4D, lanes 2 and 6). Anti-αNAC antibodies were used to confirm the presence of the αNAC protein within the shifted complexes.

With both probes, addition of the anti-αNAC antibodies to the binding reactions lead to the formation of a super shifted (SS) complex which was not observed when naive IgG was used (Fig. 4D, lanes 3–4 and 7–8), establishing that αNAC binds its cognate site within the *Lrp6* proximal promoter.

### 3.4. The *Lrp6* αNAC binding site is a functional element

Site-directed mutagenesis and shRNA-mediated knockdown were used to assess the function of the *Lrp6* αNACbds. The 5′-GCAGAAA GTA-3′ binding site was mutated to 5′-GCgGgAAGTA-3′ in the context of either the long (−2523/+120 bp) or short (−352/+120 bp) promoter fragments. In each case, mutation of the αNACbds resulted in >50% reduction of *Lrp6* promoter activity as compared to the wild-type sequence (Fig. 5A). Similarly, inhibiting αNAC expression through

cells stimulated with 100 nM PTH(1–34) or vehicle for 30 min. Results show that JUND immunoprecipitation significantly enriched the proximal *Lrp6* promoter fragment when compared to control ChIP performed using naive IgG (Fig. 6A). PTH stimulation of the osteoblasts augmented the amount of JUND-bound *Lrp6* promoter fragment but the increase was not statistically significant (Fig. 6A).

To determine whether JUND and αNAC bind the same *Lrp6* promoter fragment jointly, we performed sequential chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-reChIP) on MC3T3-E1 cells stimulated with PTH(1–34) for 30 min. The first ChIP was against JUND, followed by reChIP against αNAC. Results show that JUND immunoprecipitation significantly enriched *Lrp6* promoter fragments when compared to negative control IgG (Fig. 6B, black bars). A portion of the first ChIP product was reChIPped in parallel with anti-JUND (to validate the procedure) or anti-αNAC antibodies. The positive control confirmed that JUND was bound to the *Lrp6* promoter compared to the negative control reChIP (Fig. 6B; gray bars). ReChIP performed using the anti-αNAC antibody also showed an enrichment of the *Lrp6* promoter compared to naive IgG reChIP (Fig. 6B; gray bars). Taken together, these results show that JUND and αNAC cohabit at the *Lrp6* promoter.

We next tested whether JUND can stimulate *Lrp6* transcription and the impact of αNAC coexpression on this activity. MC3T3-E1 cells were cotransfected with various reporter constructs and with JUND and αNAC expression vectors, alone or in combination. JUND expression significantly stimulated *Lrp6* promoter activity in the context of either the long (−2523/+120 bp) or short (−352/+120 bp) promoter fragments (Fig. 6C). We next determined if αNAC can influence JUND-mediated *Lrp6* transcription. To address this we used a mutant form of αNAC (αNAC<sup>S99D</sup>) that mimics the effect of PTH-dependent phosphorylation at position Ser99 and has been shown to translocate to osteoblast nuclei and stimulate *Bglap2* transcription in the absence of PTH treatment [16]. Unlike JUND, when expressed alone αNAC<sup>S99D</sup> did not stimulate the activity of any of the *Lrp6* promoter fragments tested (Fig. 6C). However when co-expressed with JUND, αNAC<sup>S99D</sup> potentiated the JUND-mediated transcriptional activation on both long and short *Lrp6* promoter fragments (Fig. 6C). This potentiation necessitates an intact αNACbds as mutation of the binding site in the context of either the long or short promoter fragments abolished JUND-induced *Lrp6* promoter activity as well as the αNAC<sup>S99D</sup>/JUND effect (Fig. 6C). To further validate the effects of JUND on *Lrp6* promoter activity and gene expression, we used RNA interference-mediated knockdown with two different shRNAs targeting *Jund* (shJunD.1 and shJunD.2). In cultures of primary osteoblasts isolated from 5-day-old C57BL/6 mice, both shRNAs significantly inhibited *Jund* mRNA (Fig. 6D) and JUND protein (Fig. 6E) expression when compared to cells stably expressing a non-targeted shRNA (shNT). The impact of JUND suppression on *Lrp6* expression was then measured using quantitative reverse-transcription PCR on mRNA isolated from the stably transfected cell populations. Stimulation of shNT-expressing cells with PTH(1–34) for 60 min significantly increased *Lrp6* mRNA expression (Fig. 6F). When JUND expression was reduced in primary osteoblasts, basal expression and PTH-induced stimulation of *Lrp6* was abrogated (Fig. 6F). Similarly, in MC3T3-E1 osteoblastic cells, transcription from the short *Lrp6* promoter fragment was significantly inhibited when JUND expression was knocked down (Fig. 6G).

Taken together, these results show that JUND regulates *Lrp6* promoter activity and that maximal JUND-induced *Lrp6* expression is dependent on a functional αNACbds and nuclear accumulation of phosphoserine 99-activated αNAC.

### 4. Discussion

We previously reported that PTH stimulates the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of αNAC at residue Serine 99, which induces its nuclear translocation in osteoblasts. In mice, impairment of this signaling cascade results in a reduced bone volume phenotype associated with an

of LRP6 was confirmed in a mouse model in which *Lrp6* was deleted from the osteoblast cell lineage. In this model, the bone anabolic action of iPTH treatment is blunted [12]. This effect is the consequence of the ineffective action of PTH to stimulate osteoblasts differentiation and to block their apoptosis [12]. The interaction between an LRP family member and PTH1R appears to be exclusive to LRP6, as the loss of LRP5 does not affect the anabolic activity of iPTH on bone [34]. In that context, regulation of LRP6 expression and its presence at the plasma membrane is an important factor for the bone anabolic action of iPTH.

The amount of LRP6 available to complex with PTH1R affects PTH responses. N-Cadherin (encoded by the *Cdh2* gene) sequesters LRP6 away from the cell surface [35] and ablation of *Cdh2* in mice increases membrane PTH1R/LRP6 complexes. This in turn promotes signaling downstream from PHT1R, enhancing bone formation following iPTH treatment [13, 36]. LRP6 availability and activity is mainly regulated via interaction with extracellular ligands and phosphorylation of its intracellular domain (reviewed in [37–39]). However, mechanisms regulating *Lrp6* transcription more than likely contribute but have to date remained largely unknown. Kulkarni and colleagues [40] reported that *Lrp6* expression can be modulated by PTH, but the exact mechanisms were not explored. The data reported herein show that this regulation involves αNAC.

Our results suggest a ‘feed-forward’ mechanism in which αNAC plays a central role to prime subsequent iPTH responses by controlling *Lrp6* transcription to maintain a high amount of PTH1R-LRP6 complex at the plasma membrane (Fig. 7). We propose that during iPTH treatment, maintaining enough functional receptor complexes is important to ensure maximal stimulation of the PTH signal each time a new dose is injected. The model predicts that altering αNAC-dependent *Lrp6* transcription would break this feed-forward loop and impair the capacity of iPTH to stimulate bone formation. Experiments are underway in our laboratory to test this hypothesis using site-directed mutagenesis of αNAC at S99 in knock-in mice models. In parallel, we will confirm that αNAC and LRP6 form part of a common genetic pathway by altering gene dosage in compound *Naca*<sup>+/−</sup>;*Lrp6*<sup>+/−</sup> heterozygotes.

The first αNAC binding site was identified in vitro by PCR-based selection and amplification of binding sites (SAAB) [41] and represented a loose consensus: 5′-G/C G/C A G/C A G/C NNN G-3′ [21]. This first characterization revealed that mutation of the A residues at positions 3 and 5 of the consensus (bold type) inhibited the binding of αNAC to its cognate DNA sequence [21]. Our data confirms these previous findings since replacing these two A residues by G residues in the 5′-flanking sequence of the *Lrp6* gene decreased by 50% the activity of the *Lrp6* promoter. Two other genes contain a characterized, functional αNACbds within their promoter: *Myoglobin* and *Bglap2* [17, 21]. In both cases the two A residues are conserved. Comparing these previously characterized αNACbds with the one identified in *Lrp6* we notice that the core sequence 5′-CAG/CA-3′ (residues 2 to 5) appears to be crucial to define a functional αNACbds. Our study also confirmed the tolerance of αNAC regarding the identity of the sequence located at the 3′ end of the binding site. This further characterization of the core consensus of functional αNACbds could help identify new targets regulated by αNAC in bone but also in other tissues.

Despite the similarity in the sequences of the αNACbds from the *Bglap2* and *Lrp6* promoters, our results point to mechanistic differences in the control of the expression of the two genes by αNAC following PTH treatment. The first difference is the apparent permanent occupancy of αNAC on its cognate site within the *Lrp6* promoter regardless of the PTH stimulus. This contrasts with our previous findings showing that αNAC accumulates to the *Bglap2* promoter upon PTH stimulation [16]. Since only the posttranslationally modified phosphoserine 99 form of αNAC led to enrichment of *Lrp6* promoter fragments following ChIP after a PTH signal, it can be proposed that phosphoserine 99 is not only a nuclear mark but could also be considered as an activity mark.

Whether the phosphorylation of residue serine 99 necessarily occurs in the cytosol to induce nuclear translocation or involves resident nuclear αNAC activated by the nuclear pool of PKA holoenzyme [42] remains to be determined.

The second mechanistic difference concerns the partner with which αNAC interacts to stimulate transcription. αNAC regulates *Bglap2* transcription by stabilizing the interaction of cJUN homodimers with the AP-1 response element [20]. We did not measure any stimulation of *Lrp6* transcription by cJUN, alone or in combination with JUND, CREB and/or αNAC<sup>S99D</sup> (data not shown). Our data rather indicates that the PTH-activated form of αNAC potentiates the activity of another AP-1 family member, JUND, to maximally stimulate *Lrp6* transcription. It remains to be determined if JUND acts as a homodimer or needs to dimerize with a basic domain-leucine zipper transcription factor other than cJUN or CREB [43] to control *Lrp6* expression. Nevertheless, we propose that αNAC and JUND work in collaboration to mediate the anabolic action of PTH on bone.

There is some contradictory data concerning the role played by JUND in osteoblasts and bone development. The JUND/FOSL2 (FRA-2) dimer is the most abundant AP-1 complex present in fully differentiated osteoblasts [44]. Results obtained in vitro show that JUND expression in osteoblasts enhances the expression of differentiation markers such as *Runx2*, *Alpl*, *Col1a1* and *Bglap2* with the consequence of increasing their differentiation and mineralization rate [44, 45]. Our results show that JUND ablation inhibits *Lrp6* expression and promoter activity. Paradoxically, *Jund* ablation in mice resulted in an increased bone mass phenotype [46]. The discrepancy could result from the fact that *Jund* was globally deleted in that model, and the phenotype may not reflect the specific function of JUND in osteoblasts [46]. JUND activity may also be specific to the osteoblast differentiation or maturation stage [44]. A floxed *Jund* allele and differentiation stage-specific Cre drivers will be required to clarify this point.

JUND activation requires the phosphorylation of residues Ser90, Ser100 and Thr117 by JUN N-terminal Kinases (JNKs) [47–49]. It was recently shown that JNK1, the most abundantly expressed JNK family member in osteoblasts, plays an important function for proper bone development [50]. Mice in which *Jnk1* was specifically inactivated from the osteoblast lineage have a low bone mass phenotype [50]. It is worth noting that JUND binds poorly to JNKs when compared to other AP-1 family members such as cJUN and JUNB, resulting in a lower phosphorylation rate [48]. JUND phosphorylation can be enhanced when JNKs are brought in proximity through heterodimerization with a partner to which JNK can efficiently dock, such as cJUN [48]. It is unlikely that this mechanism operates downstream from PTH signaling since, as previously mentioned, we did not detect any evidence of a cJUN/JUND interaction in the regulation of *Lrp6* transcription. However, it remains interesting to speculate that αNAC could support JUND phosphorylation by JNKs.

## 5. Conclusion and perspectives

Our results provide further evidence of αNAC's role in enhancing the transcriptional activity of AP-1 family members. To our knowledge, they represent the first mechanistic characterization of the transcriptional regulation of *Lrp6* expression. They identify a novel αNAC target gene induced by PTH signaling and suggest a testable feed-forward mechanism serving to increase the amount of LRP6 available to complex with PTH1R at the plasma membrane and prime subsequent iPTH responses.

Fig. 7. Feed-forward mechanism downstream from PTH. Optimal activation of PTH1R by PTH involves its interaction with LRP6 at the plasma membrane. PTH1R coupling to Gαs activates adenylate cyclase (AC) to form cAMP and activate protein kinase A (PKA) which phosphorylates αNAC to induce its nuclear translocation and transcriptional activity. In the nucleus, αNAC binds to a conserved response element in the proximal promoter of *Lrp6* and interacts with JUND to stimulate *Lrp6* transcription and LRP6 levels. This suggests a pathway that amplifies PTH responses by increasing expression of the co-receptor. CM, cell membrane.
