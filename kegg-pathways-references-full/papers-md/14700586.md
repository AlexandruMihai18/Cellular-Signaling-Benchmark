Entamoeba histolytica, the enteric protozoan parasite that causes amebic colitis and liver abscess, was aptly named for its ability to destroy host tissues. Amebiasis remains a public health problem in developing countries despite effective anti-amebic medications, and the WHO ranks E. histolytica as the third leading parasitic cause of death. A model of pathogenesis of intestinal amebiasis is emerging from cumulative in vitro and in vivo studies. It is now clear that tissue destruction results both directly from amebic factors and from the host's inflammatory response.

Entamoeba histolytica is an enteric protozoan parasite capable of invading the intestinal mucosa and causing amebic dysentery. Extraintestinal spread occasionally occurs, most commonly to the liver. Like other diarrheal diseases, children in the world's poorest nations suffer most of the morbidity and mortality from amebiasis. The best current estimate of the global burden of amebic disease is that up to 50 million people are symptomatically infected, and up to 100,000 people die annually [1]; these data pre-date the recognition that E. histolytica must be distinguished from Entamoeba dispar, a morphologically identical, nonpathogenic intestinal parasite. Nevertheless, cohort studies in the developing world highlight the seriousness of amebiasis as a public health issue. For example, in Dhaka, Bangladesh, where diarrhea is the leading cause of childhood death, 55% of pre-school children studied prospectively had a new E. histolytica infection during two years of follow-up. The annual incidence of amebic colitis was 2.2%, which is comparable with the rate of Shigella dysentery in this cohort [2].

Entamoeba histolytica has a simple two-stage life cycle. After ingestion of the infectious cyst form in fecally contaminated food or water, excystation occurs in the lumen of the small intestine. The resultant motile trophozoites then inhabit the colon. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, resulting in encystation and cyst excretion. Around 10% of those infected develop amebic colitis characterized by subacute watery or bloody diarrhea with associated abdominal pain and weight loss (reviewed in Ref. [3]). Whereas the parasite and host determinants of symptomatic infection versus colonization remain unknown, it is becoming clear that parasite factors and the host response both contribute to disease.

Pathogenesis of amebic colitis

Figure 1 shows a model of the events leading to E. histolytica invasion, tissue destruction and persistence. Adherence of amebic trophozoites to the colonic mucus is the key initial event [4] (Figure 2a). Adherence occurs

**Figure 1. Model for the step-wise invasion of the colonic mucosa by Entamoeba histolytica.** Infection begins with excystation and adherence of trophozoites to colonic mucins. Amebic proteinases degrade mucins and facilitate penetration. Contact with epithelial cells leads to apoptotic and necrotic host cell killing and activation of an epithelial cell inflammatory program marked by: (i) activation of NF-κB; (ii) secretion of pre-IL-1β, IL-1α, IL-8, IL-6, COX-2, GRO-α and GM-CSF; and (iii) recruitment of leukocytes. Amebic cytotoxicity and neutrophil-induced tissue damage enable deep penetration by amebae and lateral spread. During chronic infection, amebae evade the host immune response, and inflammation is often minimal given the tissue destruction. However, T cells and macrophages recruited to the sight of chronic infection might contribute to disease by autoimmune mechanisms.

this, overexpression of EhCP2 in *E. dispar* increased tissue monolayer destruction *in vitro*, but had no effect on liver abscess formation in gerbils [20]. The substrate specificity of the amebic proteinases is typical for that of cathepsin B-like proteases in the papain family and *in vitro* degradation of relevant extracellular matrix proteins including type I collagen, fibronectin and laminin has been demonstrated [21,22]. Recent data indicate that the cysteine proteinases may also mediate proteolysis of enteric cell villin and cause effacement of microvilli [23]. Finally, pre-interleukin-1β (IL-1β) released from lysed epithelial cells is cleaved and activated by the cysteine proteinases, and a direct role for cysteine proteinases in the development of inflammation during early colonic invasion has been demonstrated by antisense knockout studies in severe combined immunodeficient (SCID)-human mice (see below) [24].

In vivo, disruption of the colonic epithelium results from both contact-dependent amebic killing of epithelial cells and induction of an acute epithelial cell inflammatory response with recruitment of neutrophils and immune-mediated tissue damage [25] (Figure 2c). Deep penetration of the colonic tissue followed by lateral extension of the colonic lesion then leads to the flask-shaped ulceration characteristic of well-developed disease (Figures 2b,d) and the possibility of extraintestinal spread of amebae (most commonly to the liver). Extraintestinal spread is presumed to be hematogenous, but this remains unproven.

Entamoeba histolytica trophozoites with reduced cytolytic activity *in vitro* are less able to cause liver abscess in animal models, providing the best evidence for the role of amebic host cell killing in the pathogenesis of invasive disease [26,27]. The mechanism of cell killing has been the subject of intense investigation and remains controversial. Gal/GalNAc-mediated contact with host cells is required [7,8]. Secretion of amebapore, a 5 kDa polypeptide with membrane pore-forming activity, may then lyse host cells [28]. Amebapore has homology to the pore-forming proteins granulysin and NK-lysin produced by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells [29]. The ability of purified amebapore to lyse cells at micromolar concentrations suggests a necrotic mechanism of host cell death [30]. However, simple cell lysis (necrosis) does not fully explain the phenotype of dying cells, suggesting a more complicated mechanism of cell killing. Ameba-induced nuclear chromatin condensation and internucleosomal DNA fragmentation consistent with apoptotic cell death have been observed both *in vitro* and in animal models of colitis and liver abscess [31–33]. Furthermore, an irreversible rise in intracellular calcium concentration and activation of caspase 3, a distal effector molecule in the apoptotic pathway, occur rapidly in the host cell following amebic contact and are required for cell death to proceed *in vitro* [33,34]. The importance of an apoptotic mechanism of host cell killing is emphasized by the ability of the nonspecific caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk to block amebic liver abscess formation in mice [35]. In actuality, the relative contributions of apoptotic versus necrotic cell death and indeed where the phenotype of any given dying cell falls on the spectrum from pure necrosis to pure apoptosis probably depends on the type of host cell, as well

largely through interaction of a D-galactose/N-acetyl-D-galactosamine (Gal/GalNAc)-specific amebic lectin with host glycoconjugates [5,6]. Lectin-mediated adherence is also required for cytolysis of host cells by amebae, since mammalian cells lacking N-terminal Gal and GalNAc protein modifications are resistant to amebic killing (see below) [7,8]. The lectin is a 260 kDa heterodimeric glycoprotein composed of a 170 kDa heavy subunit linked covalently to a 31–35 kDa light subunit by disulfide bonds [9]. Carbohydrate recognition is mediated by the heavy subunit [10]. Several other proteins that might participate in adherence have also been identified. These include a 150 kDa intermediate-weight lectin that co-purifies with the Gal/GalNAc lectin, the serine-rich *E. histolytica* protein (SREHP) and the 112 kDa surface protein [11–14].

In individuals who develop invasive disease, penetration of the colonic mucus barrier and direct contact with the colonic epithelium follows adherence. Amebae secrete a family of thiol (cysteine) proteinases (EhCPs) that disrupt polymerization of MUC2, the major component of human colonic mucus, and degraded mucus is less efficient at blocking amebic adherence to host cells *in vitro* [15]. It therefore appears likely that mucus degradation *in vivo* enables subsequent contact-dependent cytolysis of epithelial cells (see below).

Genes for twenty *E. histolytica* cysteine proteinases have been identified, and the pathogenicity of *E. histolytica* isolates correlates with cysteine proteinase expression [14,16,17]. Clinical *E. histolytica* isolates release 10–1000-fold more cysteine proteinase activity into culture supernatants than *E. dispar* isolates [18]. Furthermore, *E. dispar* lacks genes for two of the cysteine proteinases, EhCP1 and the membrane-bound proteinase EhCP5 [16,19]. These data suggest that qualitative differences in cysteine proteinase expression might be more important than the level of expression. Consistent with

as other host and parasite variables that at present remain unknown.

In addition to direct cytolysis of host cells by amebae, activation of an epithelial cell immune response by contact with and lysis of host cells, and subsequent recruitment of neutrophils, appears to be responsible for much of the tissue damage that occurs early during amebic invasion [25]. Lysed epithelial cells release pre-IL-1β, which is processed by the amebic cysteine proteinases to its active form [24]. Though not yet rigorously tested *in vivo*, paracrine action of IL-1β and cytolytically released IL-1α may then stimulate production of additional inflammatory mediators including IL-8, IL-6, growth-related oncogene α (GRO-α), cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by adjacent intestinal cells through a signaling pathway that is at least in part dependent on nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) [25,36]. Antisense inhibition of intestinal cell NF-κB in a SCID-human mouse model of intestinal amebiasis dramatically reduces infiltration of neutrophils and macrophages, as well as the permeability of the intestinal epithelium during acute infection [25]. Recent data also suggest that acquired immunity may perpetuate inflammation and tissue damage, since depletion of CD4⁺ T cells in a murine model of chronic amebic colitis led to increased parasite burden and cecal thickening [37]. CD4⁺ T cells may directly mediate intestinal inflammation under some circumstances as has been seen in mouse models of inflammatory bowel disease. It is also possible that the CD4⁺ T-cell response in this model is counterproductive by downregulating protective macrophage function.

In contrast to the intense inflammatory response typical of early invasive amebiasis, inflammation surrounding well-established colonic ulcers and liver abscesses in humans is often minimal given the degree of tissue damage [38]. *Entamoeba histolytica* evades the host immune response during chronic infection in several ways. The Gal/GalNAc lectin has sequence similarity and antigenic crossreactivity to CD59, a human leukocyte antigen that prevents assembly of the C5b-9 complement membrane attack complex [39]. Glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored lipophosphoglycan/proteophosphoglycan (LPG) molecules that coat amebic trophozoites have also been proposed to serve as a barrier to complement [40–42]. In addition to their role in invasion and activation of pre-IL-1β, the amebic cysteine proteinases might help to protect amebae from the immune response. The cysteine proteinases rapidly degrade the complement anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a, secretory IgA and serum IgG, as well as pre-IL-18 [43–46]. Macrophages may be important for an effective immune response because they acquire the ability to kill virulent amebae *in vitro* when activated with interferon γ (IFN-γ) [47]. However, *in vivo*, *E. histolytica* suppresses macrophage activation and major histocompatibility complex class II antigen presentation [48].

### Concluding remarks

New data from field studies of intestinal amebiasis now strongly suggest that immunity to natural *E. histolytica* infection develops, indicating that a vaccine that prevents colonization might be feasible [49]. Because only humans

and some higher, nonhuman primates are naturally infected with *E. histolytica*, interruption of fecal-oral spread could theoretically eradicate the organism. In recent years, identification of proteins associated with virulence and other immunogenic amebic surface proteins (e.g. the Gal/GalNAc lectin, amoebapore, cysteine proteinases, SREHP and surface LPG) has provided several potential vaccine targets (reviewed in Ref. [50]). Additional studies on the immunology of amebiasis and on the host and parasite factors responsible for the development of invasive disease will be essential to vaccine development. It is hoped that this progress will stimulate continued interest and financial support from developed nations, in addition to the interest of new investigators, in the study of this important global health problem.
