Abstract | Cytokines are involved in intestinal homeostasis and pathological processes associated with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The biological effects of cytokines, including several involved in the pathology of Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, occur as a result of receptor-mediated signalling through the Janus kinase (JAK) and signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) DNA-binding families of proteins. Although therapies targeting cytokines have revolutionized IBD therapy, they have historically targeted individual cytokines, and an unmet medical need exists for patients who do not respond to or lose response to these treatments. Several small-molecule inhibitors of JAKs that have the potential to affect multiple pro-inflammatory cytokine-dependent pathways are in clinical development for the treatment of IBD, with one agent, tofacitinib, already approved for ulcerative colitis and several other agents with demonstrated efficacy in early phase trials. This Review describes the current understanding of JAK–STAT signalling in intestinal homeostasis and disease and the rationale for targeting this pathway as a treatment for IBD. The available evidence for the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of JAK inhibitors in IBD as well as the potential approaches to optimize treatment with these agents, such as localized delivery or combination therapy, are also discussed.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is typically classified as either ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s disease and is generally characterized by chronic inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Regardless of classification, the initial mechanisms driving the characteristic features of disease pathology, including immune activation, epithelial destruction and stromal cell proliferation, are still largely unknown. However, once disease is established, the involvement of cytokines in both the chronic and relapsing (acute) phases of the disease has been well documented<sup>1</sup>, and monoclonal antibodies targeting key cytokines (for example, TNF) are increasingly used for the treatment of IBD that is unresponsive to corticosteroids or immunosuppressants<sup>2,3</sup>. Despite the overall benefit of these strategies, some patients will remain unresponsive or lose response to current therapies over time. New approaches are now being considered that interfere with cytokine signalling events, including those dependent on the Janus kinase (JAK) family of tyrosine kinases and the signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) family of DNA-binding proteins.

Cytokines are structurally diverse proteins produced by both immune and non-immune cells with profound functional relevance to the maintenance of physiological homeostasis<sup>4</sup>. This heterogeneous group of molecules is broadly organized according to their affinity for various receptor complexes, including the type I and II cytokine receptors. Although this family of receptors is capable of binding over 50 different molecules (including, in addition to cytokines, colony-stimulating factors and growth factors), its members share a common and distinct intracellular signalling pathway mediated by the JAK family of tyrosine kinases<sup>5</sup> (FIG. <sup>6</sup>). These kinases are associated with the intracellular domains of the type I and II cytokine receptors<sup>8</sup> and transduce ligand-binding signals through the phosphorylation of the STAT family of DNA-binding proteins. In vivo and clinical studies have provided multiple lines of evidence indicating that effective innate and adaptive immune responses require JAK–STAT signalling to mediate cytokine function<sup>7</sup>. Dysfunction of and genetic variation in JAK–STAT signalling pathways have been associated with a spectrum

level, the in vivo requirement for target specificity in multicellular systems and the long-term safety consequences of treatment given the chronic nature of IBD. In this Review, we discuss the current understanding of JAK–STAT signalling and the pathways relevant to intestinal homeostasis and pathology that provide the rationale for JAK–STAT pathway inhibition for the treatment of IBD. Furthermore, we discuss the available evidence for the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics of JAK inhibitors in IBD as well as the potential approaches, such as localized delivery or combination therapy, to optimize treatment with these agents.

**The JAK–STAT signalling pathway**

The highly conserved mammalian family of JAKs includes JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2). Although JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 are ubiquitously expressed, JAK3 expression is primarily restricted to cells of the haematopoietic system, in particular myeloid and lymphoid cells . Extracellular ligand binding to type I and II cytokine receptors induces activation and autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation of JAKs as well as JAK-mediated phosphorylation of the receptor (FIG. ). Receptor phosphorylation in turn facilitates the binding and JAK-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved C-terminal tyrosine residue in STAT family members (STAT1, 2, 3, 4, 5A, 5B and 6), leading to their homodimerization or heterodimerization , and subsequent translocation to the nucleus via Ran-GTP-dependent mechanisms . Subsequent binding of dimerized STATs to DNA-regulatory elements controls the transcription of associated genes .

Depending on the ligand and receptor, different combinations of JAKs and STATs are activated with a high degree of specificity and regulate fundamental biological processes, including the apoptosis, proliferation, migration, development and differentiation of a variety of cell types (T cells, B cells, natural killer cells, macrophages and epithelial cells, among others) (FIG. ). The relationship between the binding of a particular cytokine to its receptor and the subsequent JAK–STAT-mediated signal transduction is determined by the cytokine receptor subunits. For example, signalling in response to binding of IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21 to the type I receptor common γ-chain (γc) is mediated through JAK1 and JAK3 (REFS ) and results, for instance, in the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT6 (in response to IL-4) or STAT5A and/or STAT5B (in response to IL-2). The γc cytokines have been shown to activate a broad variety of STAT proteins, including STAT5 (REF ). Signalling in response to binding of IL-3, IL-5, erythropoietin and granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), among others, to the type I receptor β-chain is mediated through JAK2 (REF. ) and also leads to phosphorylation of STAT5A/STAT5B. Signalling in response to binding of IL-6, IL-11, IL-13, leukaemia inhibitory factor and oncostatin M to the type I receptor common glycoprotein 130 (gp130) chain occurs somewhat indiscriminately through JAK1, JAK2 and TYK2 (REFS ), with STAT3 implicated as the primary transcription factor. IL-10 and other family members (IL-19, IL-20, IL-22 and IL-26) bind to type II

cytokine receptors and share signalling pathways, including JAK1, JAK2, TYK2 and STAT3 (REFS 5,26). The IL-12 and IL-23 common receptor chain (IL-12R) is highly homologous to the common gp130 receptor chain 27 and signals through JAK2 and TYK2 (REFS 28,29). IL-12 acts primarily through the induction of STAT4 homodimers 30, and IL-23, which is crucial for the differentiation of T helper 17 (T_H_17) cells, acts through STAT3 and STAT4 (REF. 30). Interferon signalling is also dependent on JAKs, and the essential function of this family of kinases was established in cell lines resistant to interferons shortly after their discovery 31. Interferon-γ (IFNγ) requires JAK1 and JAK2, whereas IFNα and IFNβ signal through JAK1 and TYK2 (REF. 32). STAT1 is the downstream mediator of all transcriptional responses to both type I and II interferons 33. IFNγ binding leads to the formation of either STAT1–STAT1 homodimers 34 or STAT1–STAT3 heterodimers, and STAT1–STAT2 heterodimers are formed in response to binding of IFNα or IFNβ 34–36. In summary, JAK-mediated signalling can be induced by many different cytokines with a multitude of distinct outcomes. Therefore, the inhibition of one or more JAKs or STATs in vivo could lead to the inhibition of multiple cytokine pathways with the potential for somewhat unpredictable effects, especially with long-term exposure. This complexity is exemplified in the case of STAT3, which has deleterious effects in many conditions characterized by chronic inflammation and fibrosis, such as IBD, and is also aberrantly activated in many cancers, including colorectal cancer 37,38.

Nucleus

Fig. 1 | Distinct intracellular signalling pathways mediated by the JAK family of tyrosine kinases. The Janus kinase (JAK)–signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways use second messengers to convey extracellular information to the nucleus to affect target gene expression and cellular responses. The biological effects of >50 cytokines and growth factors are mediated through JAK–STAT pathways, many of which have pivotal functions in both intestinal homeostasis and inflammatory bowel disease. The cytosolic domain of the transmembrane receptors for these factors include tyrosine residues (Y) that act as docking sites for the STAT protein family members, although the receptors themselves lack intrinsic enzymatic activity and are, instead, constitutively associated with pairs of tyrosine kinase proteins (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2)). JAKs and STATs are inactive before ligand binding (centre). Signalling through the canonical JAK–STAT pathway is initiated upon extracellular ligand binding to cognate receptors, resulting in autophosphorylation and/or transphosphorylation (P) of JAKs and receptor tyrosine residues. JAK activation leads to conformational changes that bring the JAKs associated with each receptor subunit within close proximity to one another, triggering a series of subsequent phosphorylation events that ultimately result in the phosphorylation, dimerization and activation of STAT proteins. Depending on the ligand and receptor, different combinations of JAKs and STATs are activated with a high degree of specificity. Homodimerized or heterodimerized STATs then translocate into the nucleus and regulate the transcription of cytokine and/or growth factor-responsive genes, leading to the modulation of fundamental immunological processes, including survival, proliferation and differentiation of T cells, antiviral and B cell functions as well as those related to the maintenance of the intestinal epithelial barrier, haematopoiesis, growth and metabolism (green boxes).

Box 1 | Evidence for JAK–STATs in intestinal homeostasis and inflammation

- Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified disease risk variants in the JAK2, TYK2, STAT1, STAT3 (which includes STAT5A and STAT5B) and STAT4 loci<sup>45,46</sup>.
- Transcriptional analysis of whole intestinal biopsy samples revealed an upregulation of Janus kinase 1 (JAK1), JAK2, JAK3 and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) in active ulcerative colitis; increased transcription of these genes was associated with the presence of active inflammation<sup>47</sup>, and transcription was markedly reduced in the mucosa of patients with ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease in remission<sup>48</sup>.
- Single-cell RNA sequencing data show cell-restricted expression of the different JAK family members. Although JAK1 and JAK3 are predominantly expressed on T and B cells, JAK1 is also expressed on the myeloid and stromal compartments of human intestinal mucosa, and in a small subset of BEST4<sup>+</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells in healthy human colonic lamina propria. JAK2 expression was restricted to the myeloid compartment (A.S., unpublished work). Currently available single-cell RNA sequencing data show an upregulation of JAK3 in a newly identified subset of inflammatory fibroblasts enriched in active ulcerative colitis that is not present in healthy intestinal mucosa<sup>49</sup>.

targeting of this transcription factor might be complicated by the fact that STAT3 triggers a diversity of genes in response to binding to more than 40 cytokines (such as IL-6 family and IL-10) and growth factors (such as epidermal growth factor)<sup>39</sup>.

### JAK–STATs in homeostasis and IBD

Cytokines essential for immune and stromal gut cell homeostasis, such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-2 or IL-22, and those that are well-described mediators of pathological responses in both ulcerative colitis and/or Crohn’s disease (IFNγ, IL-12, IL-23 or IL-9), are all dependent on JAK–STAT-mediated signalling<sup>7,18</sup> (BOX 1). As previously mentioned, JAK and STAT proteins are shared by a large number of cytokine receptors and their expression is not necessarily restricted to specific cell types (FIG. 2). However, JAK3 is somewhat of an exception owing to its exclusive association with γc-containing cytokine receptors (for IL-2, IL-4, IL-7, IL-9, IL-15 and IL-21)<sup>40</sup>. Signalling through the γc is known to be important for lymphocyte development, maintenance and function<sup>41</sup>. Indeed, JAK3-deficient individuals exhibit dramatic defects in the immune lymphoid compartments, while demonstrating no abnormalities attributable to defects in myeloid function<sup>42</sup>. However, data from JAK3-deficient mice suggest that this kinase has a protective role on non-haematopoietic intestinal epithelial homeostasis<sup>43</sup>. Indeed, Jak3-knockout mice show a defect in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation and an increased susceptibility to dextran sulfate sodium-induced colitis<sup>44</sup>. However, evidence linking epithelial JAK3 function to intestinal homeostasis or inflammation in humans is lacking.

The complexity of and cell-dependence on JAK–STAT signalling in the human intestine is also obvious from the various influences of genetic polymorphisms on IBD risk. Gain-of-function variants of JAK2, TYK2, STAT1, STAT3 and STAT4 have been associated with both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease<sup>45,46</sup>. However, besides STAT5A and STAT5B, which are at the STAT3 locus, none of the identified IBD risk variants is related to the γc–JAK1–JAK3 or STAT6 pathway. These data collectively support the observation that cytokines such as IL-2, IL-7 or IL-4 are not yet directly implicated in the pathophysiology of the disease, whereas signalling pathways downstream of mediators such as IL-23, IL-12, interferons, IL-6 and GM-CSF might have a more prominent role in IBD susceptibility.

#### JAK family of proteins

Regardless of the influence of genetics on their expression and function, the analysis of publicly available whole biopsy transcriptomic data shows the substantial upregulation of all four JAK transcripts in the intestinal mucosa of patients with active ulcerative colitis compared with non-IBD controls (Gene Expression Omnibus series accession number GSE38713 (REF.<sup>47</sup>); A.S., unpublished work). In another cohort of patients with active ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease starting anti-TNF treatment (GSE16879)<sup>48</sup>, microarray analysis found a substantial decrease in both JAK1 and JAK2 compared with baseline in patients achieving endoscopic remission (A.S., unpublished work). Although it is clear that active IBD is associated with increased transcription of JAKs, the cell types that predominantly express each of the JAK proteins and those that regulate their expression in inflamed tissues in humans are unfortunately poorly characterized. However, the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has facilitated a nascent understanding of cell-specific gene regulation within complex tissues such as the intestine. Unpublished scRNA-seq data show that JAK1 and JAK3 are predominantly expressed on T and B cells (expressing the γc receptor) within the healthy colonic mucosa (A.S., unpublished work). In addition to JAK3, JAK1 can partner with JAK2 and TYK2 to mediate signalling in response to cytokines such as IL-6, IL-10, IL-22 and interferons. The presence of JAK1 within the myeloid and stromal compartments of human intestinal mucosa, and in a small subset of BEST4<sup>+</sup>EPCAM<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells, as well as the restricted expression of JAK2 in the myeloid compartment (predominantly macrophages and dendritic cells), has also been observed (A.S., unpublished work). Remarkably, JAK2 disease-risk variants have been shown to result in gain of function and high cytokine production by macrophages<sup>45</sup>. Finally, TYK2 exhibits discreet and scattered expression by a few cells within larger cell populations, including T cells and plasma cells, and to a lesser degree by B cells, mesenchymal cells and epithelial cells, in healthy intestinal mucosa (A.S., unpublished work). These data collectively suggest cellular compartmentalization of JAK expression and the potential for a differential contribution of individual cell subsets and/or cytokine pathways to intestinal homeostasis. Expression of JAKs in the inflamed mucosa is also likely to be differentially regulated within these distinct cell types. For instance, a high characteristic expression of JAK3, CCL19, CCL21 and TNFSF14 (also known as LIGHT), among other proteins, was observed in a newly identified subset of inflammatory fibroblasts enriched in active ulcerative colitis that is not present in healthy intestinal mucosa<sup>49</sup>. In the context of inflammation, a considerable modification of cells and functions that are dependent on JAK signalling is therefore expected. scRNA-seq data on tissue

from patients receiving different treatments, including small-molecule JAK inhibitors, will shed light on the currently uncharted territory of JAK cell type-specific regulation in the intestine.

**STAT family of proteins.** The influence of the STAT family of proteins on IBD pathology is also an area of active investigation. STAT1 is phosphorylated by either JAK1 and JAK2 or JAK1 and TYK2 and has a fundamental role

in signalling via the IFNγ and related family of receptors. Studies have reported somewhat conflicting data on the expression of STAT1 in IBD, with reports of increased expression and activation in both ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease as well as higher levels of total but not phosphorylated (activated) STAT1 in Crohn’s disease but not in ulcerative colitis than in healthy individuals as controls [50, 51]. Transcriptional studies also support increased STAT1 expression in the mucosa of patients

Fig. 2 | Pleiotropic role of JAK-associated receptors in IBD. Several cytokines involved in innate and adaptive immunity that signal through the Janus kinase (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathway are shown. In the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, dendritic cells and other antigen-presenting cells are central to initiation of antigen-specific immune responses determining the activation of B cells and differentiation of naive T helper (T<sub>H</sub>0) cells driven by specific JAK-STAT signalling cytokine-receptor interactions (top). These interactions lead to differentiation and expansion into T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, T<sub>H</sub>9 and T<sub>H</sub>17 effector cells in the lamina propria of the intestinal mucosa (middle). In turn, T<sub>H</sub> cell subtypes act through cytokine-receptor-JAK-STAT signalling interactions to modulate other immune cells such as CD8<sup>+</sup> cytotoxic cells, regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells, macrophages and dendritic cells. In addition, non-haematopoietic cells, such as intestinal epithelial cells and myofibroblasts, are activated by T cell and macrophage-derived cytokines, thus modulating the intestinal epithelial barrier and fibrosis through JAK-STAT signalling (bottom). After activation, these non-haematopoietic cells can produce diverse cytokines that interact with the immune system. Most of the JAK-STAT signalling cytokines are pro-inflammatory; however, some are protective or have dual roles such as IL-10, IL-22 and IL-2 (thinner arrows), which have anti-inflammatory functions, enhance the intestinal epithelial barrier or promote T<sub>reg</sub> survival. JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2) and the family of STAT transcription factors combine to signal different cytokine functions (bottom). In this manner, JAK inhibitors can extensively influence the immunopathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including the inflammatory response, the intestinal epithelial barrier and fibrosis.

with Crohn’s disease<sup>52</sup>. However, the functional relevance of STAT1 in mediating intestinal inflammation is less clear. Amelioration of experimental colitis has been observed in STAT1-deficient mice<sup>53</sup> and with inhibition of STAT1 in T cells specifically<sup>54</sup>, suggesting a contribution of STAT1 to the inflammatory response; however, regulatory and/or anti-inflammatory properties have also been described for STAT1 in other cell types (such as intestinal epithelial cells)<sup>55,56</sup>. Although a precise role for STAT1 in IBD is still debated, STAT1 activation in lymphocyte populations supports pro-inflammatory responses, whereas activation in macrophages or intestinal epithelial cells suggests protective functions<sup>55,56</sup>.

STAT3 seems to have a fundamental role in IBD; however, similar to STAT1, evidence exists of both protective and anti-inflammatory roles for this transcription factor. STAT3 activation occurs as a result of cytokine binding (for example, IL-6) to the gp130 receptor and through JAK1, JAK2 or TYK2, and is also essential for cellular responses to IL-10 family members such as IL-10 and IL-22. Several studies have reported an increased expression of STAT3 or STAT3 phosphorylation in human IBD<sup>51,52,57</sup> but the therapeutic potential of targeting this protein remains unclear. Data from patients with IBD support a role for STAT3 activation (attributed to IL-6 signalling) in the resistance of T cells to apoptosis<sup>58</sup>. STAT3 has also been shown to be essential for the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells and for T<sub>H</sub>17 cell-dependent murine colitis<sup>59–61</sup>. Data in mouse models also support a pathogenic role of STAT3. Hyperactivation of STAT3 in mice with a conditional knockout that was able to overcome the inhibitory effect of suppressor of cytokine signalling 3 (SOCS3) promoted severe colitis<sup>62</sup> and inhibition of STAT3 induced apoptosis of lamina propria cells and ameliorated colitis<sup>63</sup>. Despite these data, cytokines such as IL-22, IL-24 and IL-10 with key homeostatic and anti-inflammatory roles are also potent activators of STAT3. IL-22 has been shown to reduce disease activity in experimental colitis by promoting epithelial function, specifically goblet cell regeneration and mucus production<sup>64</sup>. Similarly, positive effects on epithelial function have been attributed to IL-24 (REF.<sup>65</sup>), and IL-10 activation of STAT3 in macrophages and neutrophils might be required to prevent disease in experimental models of colitis<sup>66,67</sup>. A potential unifying hypothesis for these conflicting data is that STAT3 promotes pro-inflammatory signals in cells of the adaptive immune system, whereas its role in the innate compartment might result in protection from colitis<sup>68</sup>. However, this theory could be an oversimplification, as IL-10-dependent STAT3 phosphorylation is also essential for the promotion of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cell function.

STAT4 phosphorylation is mediated by JAK2 and TYK2 in response to cytokines such as IL-12 and IL-23. STAT4 signalling is essential for T<sub>H</sub>1 cell development in response to IL-12 (REFS<sup>69,70</sup>) regulation of IFNγ expression in natural killer cells<sup>71</sup> and T<sub>H</sub>1 cell activity in response to IL-21 (REF.<sup>72</sup>). Moreover, STAT4 has been implicated in IL-23 responses of memory T<sub>H</sub>17 cells<sup>73</sup> as well as in promoting the transition of T<sub>H</sub>17 cells to colitogenic T<sub>H</sub>1 cells in mouse models<sup>74</sup>. Given the established role of the IL-12–IFNγ and IL-23 pathways in IBD, targeting

STAT4-mediated pathways could be a promising therapeutic approach. Indeed, deletion of STAT4 was partially protective for the development of experimental colitis<sup>75</sup>, whereas STAT4 hyperactivation led to T<sub>H</sub>1 cell-mediated spontaneous colitis in mice<sup>76</sup>.

STAT5 activation occurs primarily through JAK1 and JAK3 after engagement of the γc family of receptors. STAT5 can also be activated in response to IL-3 and the single chain family (that is, growth hormones). Protective roles for growth hormones, mediated through STAT5B activation, have been demonstrated in models of colitis<sup>77</sup>, and Stat5b-knockout mice had increased susceptibility to chemically induced colitis<sup>78</sup> through the enhanced apoptosis of intestinal epithelial cells<sup>79</sup>. Consistent with this observation, STAT5 has been shown to promote the proliferation of the intestinal epithelial cell compartment, which is essential for intestinal crypt regeneration<sup>80</sup>. STAT5 also has a role in IL-2-dependent induction of FOXP3 (a transcription factor that drives T<sub>reg</sub> cell differentiation) and in shifting T<sub>H</sub>17 cell differentiation towards the development of T<sub>reg</sub> cells<sup>81</sup>. These data would suggest that STAT5 might not be a desired therapeutic target for the treatment of IBD.

Similar to STAT5, STAT6 phosphorylation is mediated by JAK1 and JAK3, although, in the case of STAT6, activation occurs through the γc receptors IL-4R and IL-13R<sup>82</sup>. Its primary role is to induce T<sub>H</sub>2-type responses, and has therefore been frequently studied in the context of T<sub>H</sub>2-dependent disease models in which a role in mediating pathogenesis has been observed<sup>83–85</sup>. STAT6 has also been implicated in the differentiation of T<sub>H</sub>9 cells<sup>86</sup>. A role for IL-4-dependent STAT6-activation has also been described for the polarization of M2-like macrophages involved in mucosal repair in a 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid-induced mouse model of acute colitis<sup>87</sup>. An increase in phosphorylated STAT6 has been observed in tissue samples from patients with ulcerative colitis<sup>88,89</sup> and is consistent with the T<sub>H</sub>2 and T<sub>H</sub>9 cell profile of these patients. However, there are currently no data supporting a clinical benefit of inhibition of the T<sub>H</sub>2 cell response mediated by IL-13 (REFS<sup>90,91</sup>).

Compared with other STAT family members, STAT2, which is involved in signal transduction in response to type I interferons, has been studied the least in the context of IBD. One study has suggested that STAT2 is downregulated in IBD<sup>51</sup>, and no data are available in experimental models of intestinal inflammation in support of a pathological role.

### Rationale for JAK–STAT inhibition in IBD

Similar to most human immune-mediated disorders, robust activation of pro-inflammatory pathways and impaired self-tolerance exemplified by enhanced effector T cell development and T<sub>reg</sub> cell dysfunction are important features of IBD pathogenesis<sup>92–98</sup>. Notably, excessive production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-6, IL-23, IL-12 and IL-21, from lamina propria innate immune cells potentiates the effector T cell transcriptional programme in response to dysbiosis and intestinal epithelial dysfunction<sup>1,72,99–104</sup>. Thus, it is unsurprising that enhanced effector T cell function is one of the hallmarks of IBD. In support for the role of T<sub>H</sub> cells in

disease progression, genetic variants identified through genome-wide association studies have demonstrated that the JAK2–IL-23, SMAD3 and IL-2RA pathways are enriched with IBD susceptibility loci [46,105,106], implying that patients with IBD are likely to benefit from therapies directed towards molecular targets that impinge on the differentiation and function of effector T cells (FIG. 2). Indeed, these insights have led to the development and regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) of therapies such as the monoclonal antibody ustekinumab, directed against the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23, and a non-specific pan-JAK inhibitor (tofacitinib) for the treatment of Crohn’s disease (ustekinumab) and ulcerative colitis (ustekinumab and tofacitinib, discussed later) [107–112].

Given the importance of these cytokines in skewing \(T_{\mathrm{H}}\) or \(T_{\mathrm{reg}}\) cell functionality, these IBD therapies will not only inhibit pathogenic effector T cell function but also presumably positively affect \(T_{\mathrm{reg}}\) cell function as pro-inflammatory cytokine signals are known to repress \(T_{\mathrm{reg}}\) cell function by mechanisms that are still poorly understood [92]. However, in other scenarios, accumulating evidence also suggests that the expression of other T cell-specific transcription factors, including T-bet, GATA3 and RORγt, have a positive role in \(T_{\mathrm{reg}}\) cell-mediated immunosuppression and epithelial restitution [99,113]. Thus, the transdifferentiating capacity or plasticity of T cells might complicate the use of these biological agents and small-molecule inhibitors for IBD treatment. The importance of JAK signalling to intestinal homeostasis, particularly in epithelial cell, myeloid cell and myofibroblast biology, is emphasized by the risk of intestinal perforation and complications observed in patients with RA treated with tocilizumab or tofacitinib, in which the incidence of perforation per 1,000 patients has been reported as 1.55 with tocilizumab and 0.86 with tofacitinib treatment. Most perforations occurred in the lower gastrointestinal tract, and, although the incidence of these events was numerically higher with tofacitinib treatment than with TNF inhibitors, it was not statistically significantly higher [114,115].

In addition to the therapeutic potential of JAK inhibition, data from animal models discussed earlier suggest that modulation of STAT function could also provide some benefit for the control of intestinal inflammation [173,54,116]. Nevertheless, there have been no human studies to date examining STAT inhibition for the treatment of IBD. However, potent STAT3 inhibitors are being explored for the treatment of various malignancies, including colorectal cancer [117–119], in which the aberrant function of STAT3 has been extensively documented [120–124]. Indeed, the first report of a STAT inhibitor [125] targeted the STAT3 pathway. To date, only a few STAT3 inhibitors have been tested in clinical trials with somewhat marginal success, and none has achieved regulatory approval for the treatment of cancer [126]. These agents include the small-molecule STAT3 inhibitors napabucasin [119], STA-21 (REF. [127]) and OPB-31121 (REF. [128]) or antisense oligonucleotides (for example, AZD9150 (REF. [129])) to block STAT3 binding or activation in colorectal cancer and advanced solid tumours [119,128]. Preclinical studies in arthritis and neuroblastoma have also been undertaken [127,129]. Other classes of STAT3 inhibitors (for example, atovaquone, an antimicrobial approved by the FDA) have also been explored [130]. Direct targeting of STAT3 was shown to reduce airway inflammation in a mouse model of asthma [131], although this approach has not been studied in clinical trials.

Targeting STAT3 for the treatment of IBD might pose certain disease-related risks. As discussed earlier, STAT3 is involved in signalling downstream of IL-10, IL-22 and IL-6, all of which could be necessary for the maintenance or restoration of intestinal homeostasis and epithelial healing. Other STAT proteins, particularly STAT4, could be highly desirable targets in the context of IBD, although, to our knowledge, drug development for this indication has not yet been undertaken [21].

### JAK inhibitors in IBD

#### Efficacy of JAK inhibitors in IBD

Currently, the only JAK inhibitor approved by the FDA and the EMA for the treatment of patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis is tofacitinib [109,110] (TABLE 1). The large phase III OCTAVE programme that led to regulatory approval for the treatment of ulcerative colitis included two identical induction studies [132] in which patients were randomly assigned to receive 10 mg of tofacitinib twice daily or placebo for 8 weeks. Remission (a total Mayo Clinic score ≤2, with no subscore >1 and a rectal bleeding subscore of 0) at 8 weeks occurred in 18.5% (OCTAVE 1) and 16.6% (OCTAVE 2) of patients randomly assigned to tofacitinib versus 8.2% (OCTAVE 1) and 3.6% (OCTAVE 2) of patients randomly assigned to placebo (\(P = 0.007\) and \(P < 0.001\), respectively). The OCTAVE Sustain maintenance study [132] re-randomized week 8 responders to receive 10 mg or 5 mg of maintenance tofacitinib twice daily or placebo for 52 weeks. Remission at 52 weeks was significantly higher in patients treated with 5 mg (34.3%) and 10 mg (40.6%) of tofacitinib than with placebo (11.1%; \(P < 0.001\) for both comparisons with placebo). Interestingly, earlier phase II studies with the same compound did not demonstrate similar benefits in Crohn’s disease [133] and

therefore development of tofacitinib for this indication was terminated. Although the primary and secondary end points in the Crohn’s disease trials were not met<sup>133</sup>, there were modest but not statistically significant dose-related reductions in week 4 serum C-reactive protein (CRP) and faecal calprotectin concentrations with the higher doses. These dose–response trends suggest a reduction in objective inflammation and a probable biological effect<sup>133</sup>. Furthermore, a meta-analysis published in 2019 of all placebo-controlled randomized trials of JAK inhibitors in adults with IBD concluded that these drugs were effective for induction therapy in patients with refractory Crohn’s disease<sup>134</sup>. It is possible that the phase II trial of tofacitinib in patients with Crohn’s disease failed to meet its primary end point because of high placebo response and remission rates, which might have been caused by a combination of factors, including the use of concomitant medication (for example, a high proportion of patients using corticosteroids and a slow prolonged taper during maintenance therapy), study design (for example, site investigator rather than blinded central reading of endoscopy for study enrolment) and the primary end point (for example, Crohn’s disease activity index (CDAI) rather than patient-reported outcomes including objective markers of disease activity<sup>135</sup>).

Although the previously mentioned meta-analysis by Ma et al. found no evidence, to date, for efficacy (or safety) benefits with more selective JAK inhibition<sup>134</sup>, a number of more selective JAK inhibitors are currently under development for the treatment of IBD. The oral selective JAK1 inhibitor, filgotinib, showed early clinical benefit in Crohn’s disease in the phase II FITZROY study (NCT02048618)<sup>136</sup>. FITZROY included patients with active symptoms (CDAI score 220–450) and centrally confirmed endoscopically active Crohn’s disease (Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn’s disease (SES-CD) ≥7 or ≥4 in the case of isolated ileitis). A total of 174 patients with moderately to severely active Crohn’s disease were randomly assigned to receive 200 mg of filgotinib daily or placebo for 10 weeks. Clinical remission (CDAI score <150) at week 10 was achieved in 47% of patients treated with filgotinib compared with 23% of patients treated with placebo (difference 24%, 95% CI 9–39; *P* = 0.0077). The rate of endoscopic improvement (defined as a 50% reduction in the SES-CD score) at week 10 was numerically but not statistically significantly higher in patients treated with filgotinib than in patients in the placebo group (25% versus 14%, respectively). Normalization of CRP concentrations in patients who had elevated baseline concentrations occurred more frequently in patients treated with filgotinib than in patients treated with placebo (27% versus 14%, respectively). Similar reductions were observed for faecal calprotectin concentrations. Whereas the phase II study was not powered for endoscopic outcomes, the endoscopic and biomarker findings confirm a meaningful effect of JAK1 inhibition in Crohn’s disease. A large phase III clinical development programme of filgotinib for the treatment of Crohn’s disease (NCT02914561 and NCT02914600)<sup>137,138</sup> and ulcerative colitis (NCT02914535 and NCT02914522)<sup>139,140</sup> is ongoing, as are dedicated trials for patients with perianal

fistulizing (NCT03077412)<sup>141</sup> and small bowel Crohn’s disease (NCT03046056)<sup>142</sup>.

Upadacitinib, another JAK1-selective inhibitor, has completed phase II development for Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. The Crohn’s disease CELEST study<sup>143</sup> randomly assigned 220 patients with moderately to severely active disease to receive upadacitinib (3 mg, 6 mg, 12 mg and 24 mg twice daily and 24 mg once daily) or placebo. The co-primary end points included endoscopic remission (SES-CD ≤4 and ≥2 point reduction from baseline with no subscore >1) at weeks 12 or 16, and clinical remission (stool frequency ≤1 and abdominal pain ≤1 and both not worse than baseline) at week 16. Induction treatment with upadacitinib was associated with endoscopic improvement and clinical benefit in this dose-ranging study. ACHIEVE-UC was also a dose-ranging (7.5 mg, 15 mg, 30 mg, 45 mg once daily), placebo-controlled study (8 weeks) in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis<sup>144</sup>. The primary objective, a statistically significant dose–response relationship of upadacitinib to achieve clinical remission at week 8 compared with placebo, was met, with the highest clinical remission rate observed with 45 mg of upadacitinib once daily. The positive efficacy signal and favourable tolerability and safety profile support further evaluation in a phase III programme.

Other JAK inhibitors are currently being studied in ulcerative colitis and Crohn’s disease (TABLE 1). The pan-JAK inhibitor peficitinib (25 mg, 75 mg, or 150 mg once daily or 75 mg twice daily) failed to demonstrate a statistically significant change from baseline in the Mayo Clinic score at week 8 compared with placebo in a randomized trial involving 229 patients with ulcerative colitis<sup>143</sup>. The lack of clinical change was accompanied by a lack of statistically significant reductions in serum CRP and faecal calprotectin concentrations. These observations raise questions regarding the optimal degree of inhibitor selectivity as well as more general questions such as the timing for primary end point assessment, the definitions for primary end points and the scoring systems used to define them.

Finally, to reduce potential systemic toxicity and improve efficacy, an intestinally restricted pan-JAK inhibitor, TD-1473, was developed with more than tenfold lower systemic exposure and was explored in a phase Ib 4-week study in ulcerative colitis<sup>145</sup>. Higher rates of clinical response and mucosal healing (Mayo Clinic endoscopic subscore of ≤1) at week 4 were observed in patients treated with all doses of TD-1473 compared with patients treated with placebo (for whom no clinical response or mucosal healing was observed). Although this was a small (*n* = 40) study, these results are encouraging and support a proper phase II dose-finding study. A summary of cytokines and/or JAKs modulated by JAK inhibitors that are either approved or in development for the treatment of IBD is shown in TABLE 2.

Safety of JAK inhibitors. As different combinations of JAKs are utilized by a wide array of growth factors, hormones and cytokine receptors, their functions are consequently pleiotropic (FIG. 1). Although JAK inhibitors are preferentially directed to specific JAKs, higher

doses could affect multiple JAKs owing to off-target binding, potentially leading to haematological, metabolic or immunosuppressive adverse effects<sup>146</sup> (FIG. 3). Furthermore, as with other small-molecule drugs, JAK inhibitors could induce idiosyncratic drug hypersensitivity, drug allergies and drug–drug interactions<sup>147</sup>. Despite these potential risks, evidence from clinical trials involving patients with IBD<sup>132,148,149</sup>, RA<sup>150</sup> and psoriasis<sup>151</sup> thus far support a favourable safety profile for these agents.

As previously mentioned, the approval of tofacitinib in 2018 for the treatment of moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis by the FDA was based on two induction<sup>132</sup> and one 52-week maintenance<sup>132</sup> randomized controlled trails that demonstrated no overall difference in the rates of adverse events between the recommended dose of tofacitinib (up to 10 mg twice daily) and placebo. The most commonly reported adverse events in the trials were influenza, nasopharyngitis, arthralgia and headache. In the OCTAVE induction studies<sup>132</sup>, infections occurred more frequently with tofacitinib treatment than with placebo, including a small but higher risk than placebo for serious infections (1.3% versus 0% in OCTAVE 1 and 0.2% versus 0% in OCTAVE 2). In the OCTAVE Sustain maintenance study<sup>132</sup>, a higher rate of herpes zoster infection was observed in the 10 mg tofacitinib group (5.1%) than in the 5 mg tofacitinib (1.5%) and placebo (0.5%) groups, although no serious cases were observed. Factors associated with a higher risk of herpes zoster infection in these studies included age >65 years, Asian ethnicity, prior TNF inhibitor failure and higher dose<sup>152</sup>. An integrated analysis published in 2018 of the aforementioned IBD studies with a median follow-up of 1.4 years and 1,621.8 patient-years of exposure showed a dose-dependent risk of herpes zoster infection, but other opportunistic infections were infrequent and not unlike those with placebo<sup>153</sup>.

A similar adverse event profile has been demonstrated in longer-term data based on 22,000 patient-years of exposure over 8.5 years of treatment in patients with RA<sup>150</sup>. The risk of lymphoma and other malignancies based on data from the RA clinical development programme and pooled analysis of ulcerative colitis studies was low<sup>153–156</sup> and stable. An increased risk of gastrointestinal perforation was observed in patients with RA exposed to tofacitinib<sup>150</sup>; however, only three cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been reported in patients with ulcerative colitis (incidence rate of 0.2 events per 100 patient-years of exposure)<sup>153</sup> and all of the patients with ulcerative colitis had additional risk factors for perforation such as active colitis, concomitant use of corticosteroids, recent endoscopy or neoplastic lesions. Likewise, spontaneous post-marketing reports of thrombotic events in patients with RA on tofacitinib and other JAK inhibitors have raised concerns<sup>157</sup>, although some analyses have shown that these events are uncommon and could be related to the underlying condition<sup>158,159</sup>. However, two boxed warnings for an increased risk of pulmonary embolism and mortality with a 10 mg twice daily dose have been added to the prescribing information for tofacitinib based on post-marketing data derived from patients with RA who were at least 50 years old and had at least one cardiovascular risk factor<sup>160</sup>. This increased risk was observed in a FDA-mandated post-approval study designed to evaluate the risk of cardiac-related events, malignancy and opportunistic infections when tofacitinib (10 mg or 5 mg twice daily) was used in combination with methotrexate compared with a TNF inhibitor. The prescribing information for patients with ulcerative colitis was also updated to reflect the FDA's recommendation that tofacitinib be used at the lowest dose for the shortest duration possible to achieve and/or maintain a therapeutic response; maintenance

dosing should not exceed 5 mg twice daily, and 10 mg twice daily should not be used beyond the induction period except for loss of response.

Given the role of JAKs in haematopoiesis, potential changes in laboratory parameters should be periodically assessed, including the number of lymphocytes, neutrophils and, to a lesser extent, anaemia [153,161] (FIG. 3). Increased serum levels of liver transaminases, creatinine and creatine phosphokinase have been reported, but these elevations have not been associated with liver or renal failure or rhabdomyolysis [151–153]. A dose-dependent increase in LDL and HDL cholesterol concentrations has also been observed; although this finding has not been associated with a higher incidence of cardiovascular events in up to 8.5 years of follow-up in patients with RA [150]. All changes in laboratory parameters described earlier are reversible on therapy cessation. Although tofacitinib was shown to be teratogenic and feticidal in animal models when used at doses several times higher than those used in humans [158], no fetal deaths or congenital malformations were observed in the clinical development programmes for RA, psoriasis or IBD [162,163]. However, the safety of JAK inhibitors during pregnancy or breastfeeding has not been well established in larger cohorts and, therefore, their use in these patient populations should probably be avoided.

Peficitinib preferentially inhibits JAK3 but, similar to tofacitinib, it also affects JAK1, TYK2 and, potentially, JAK2; these agents are therefore considered pan-JAK inhibitors and largely share a similar adverse event profile [143,164]. Several next-generation JAK inhibitors are currently in clinical development (TABLES 1, 2). It is presumed that agents with either greater selectivity for specific JAKs (filgotinib, upadacitinib, PF-0670084l and PF-06651600) or gut-selective drugs (TD-1473) could confer improved safety profiles. Data from a phase II study of patients with Crohn’s disease treated with the JAK1-selective inhibitor filgotinib for 20 weeks revealed no differences in serious treatment-emergent adverse events compared with placebo, although serious infections were observed in 4 of 152 (3%) patients in the filgotinib group compared with none in the placebo group (0 of 67 patients) [136]; one case of herpes zoster infection was reported in the filgotinib group. A 15-week study comparing different doses of the JAK1-selective inhibitor upadacitinib in 153 patients with Crohn’s disease did not find a dose-dependent rate of adverse events; however, this study lacked a placebo group [165]. The safety of the gut-selective pan-JAK inhibitor TD-1473 was evaluated in a 28-day phase Ib study of 40 patients with ulcerative colitis compared with placebo; notably, no cases of serious or opportunistic infection were reported [166]. Although these data are reassuring, the complexity of JAK–STAT pathways and the potential for uncommon idiosyncratic reactions mandates a thorough safety evaluation of these newer agents in larger and longer clinical trials as well as appropriate post-marketing studies.

Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of JAK inhibitors. The potency and selectivity of a JAK inhibitor can be respectively described by its half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC₅₀) and by comparison of its IC₅₀ to different JAKs. In human whole blood assays, tofacitinib has an IC₅₀ for JAK1 of 74nM and a 10-fold selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2; in comparison, filgotinib has an IC₅₀ for JAK1 of 629 nM and a 28-fold selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 [REF. 167]. For TD-1473, the cell stimulation IC₅₀ for JAK1–3 and TYK2 was reported to be in the range of

www.nature.com/nrgastro

32–158 nM, with limited selectivity<sup>168</sup>. By contrast, upadacitinib has the highest reported selectivity of 74-fold for JAK1 over JAK2 (REF.<sup>169</sup>).

Current JAK inhibitors are orally bioavailable small molecules that typically exhibit a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile. Metabolism occurs primarily in the liver by hepatic enzymes such as cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) and CYP2D6. Tofacitinib has a linear and dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile with a functional half-life of ~3 hours<sup>170</sup>. Clearance is mediated primarily by hepatic metabolism (70%) and renal elimination (30%)<sup>171</sup>. Primary and secondary hepatic metabolism occurs through CYP3A4 and CYP2C19, respectively, with fewer than 10% circulating metabolites. By contrast, filgotinib undergoes extensive metabolism by carboxylesterases, leading to an active metabolite with an IC<sub>50</sub> for JAK1 of 11.9 μM and eightfold selectivity for JAK1 over JAK2 (REF.<sup>172</sup>). Filgotinib has a dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile, characterized by a rapid absorption and biphasic elimination, with an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life of ~6 hours for the parent compound and ~23 hours for the active metabolite. This leads to a substantially higher exposure (~16-fold to 20-fold) of the active metabolite over the parent filgotinib, which may compensate for the lesser potency of the former in contributing to the pharmacodynamic effect<sup>173</sup>. TD-1473 is characterized by a multiphasic and dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile, with an apparent mean terminal elimination half-life in the range of ~4–44 hours<sup>174</sup>. Compared with other JAKs, TD-1473 is a gut-restrictive compound. Plasma exposures in patients with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis were low and consistent with those observed in healthy individuals<sup>145</sup>. Colonic tissue concentrations of TD-1473 were expectedly higher than plasma and in the range needed for JAK inhibition. Interestingly, in a study in which 40 patients with ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned 1:1:1:1 to either placebo, 20 mg, 80 mg or 270 mg of TD-1473, the highest dose (270 mg) led to proportional increases in plasma, but not tissue, concentrations<sup>175</sup>. Upadacitinib is characterized by a bi-exponential and dose-proportional pharmacokinetic profile with a functional half-life of ~4 hours<sup>176</sup>. Elimination of upadacitinib occurs through hepatic metabolism (CYP3A4 and CYP2D6) (80%) and urinary elimination (20%).

Although well described for the systemic circulation, the pharmacokinetic profile of JAK inhibitors at the site

- The potential for JAK inhibitors in difficult-to-treat patient populations (for example, in those with perianal fistulizing Crohn’s disease)<sup>188</sup>

of action — in the gut tissue — remains to be elucidated. From a pharmacodynamic perspective, further translational research is needed to unravel the mechanism of action of JAK inhibitors and the benefits of JAK selectivity and/or of locally acting JAK inhibitors.

**Potential for JAK inhibitors as combination therapy in IBD.** Various combinations of medical therapy are typically used for the treatment of IBD. For example, oral and topical formulations of mesalazine (5-aminosalicylic acid) are often combined and corticosteroids are frequently prescribed to induce remission just before, or concomitantly with, immunomodulatory and biological drug therapy. Current North American and European guidelines, including care pathways proposed by the American Gastroenterological Association, generally recommend adding an immunomodulator when infliximab is initiated<sup>177–180</sup> based on the results of the SONIC and UC-SUCCESS trials in patients with Crohn’s disease<sup>181</sup> and ulcerative colitis<sup>182</sup>, respectively. These trials demonstrated superior clinical and endoscopic outcomes when infliximab and azathioprine were used as combination therapy compared with treatment with either agent alone. There are limited data published on the efficacy and safety of combination biological therapy for IBD<sup>183</sup>. A prospective open label trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of triple combination therapy consisting of oral methotrexate, vedolizumab and adalimumab is currently underway (NCT02764762)<sup>184</sup>.

The safety and efficacy of a JAK inhibitor in combination with an immunomodulatory drug for the treatment of IBD is unknown. In the OCTAVE tofacitinib trial, permissible concomitant medications included aminosalicylates and oral glucocorticoids (maximum 25 mg daily), whereas other immunomodulatory agents, such as azathioprine, methotrexate and mercaptopurine, were prohibited. However, data on the safety and efficacy of tofacitinib when used in combination with methotrexate are available from the field of rheumatology. Combination treatment with methotrexate (oral or parenteral stable doses of 7.5 mg to 25 mg per week) and tofacitinib resulted in rapid and clinically meaningful improvements in signs and symptoms as well as in physical function in patients with RA with prior inadequate response to treatment with TNF inhibitors<sup>185</sup>. The efficacy of tofacitinib monotherapy and of methotrexate in combination with either tofacitinib or adalimumab for the treatment of RA was compared in the ORAL strategy trial<sup>186</sup>. In this study, patients were randomly assigned (1:1:1) to treatment with oral tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) monotherapy, oral tofacitinib (5 mg twice daily) and methotrexate (15–25 mg per week), or subcutaneous adalimumab (40 mg every other week) and methotrexate (15–25 mg per week). The primary end point was the proportion of patients who attained an American College of Rheumatology response of at least 50% (ACR50) at 6 months. A total of 147 of 384 (38%) patients in the tofacitinib group achieved an ACR50 response compared with 173 of 376 (46%) in the tofacitinib and methotrexate group and 169 of 386 (44%) in the adalimumab and methotrexate group. Treatment-related adverse events were reported in

101 of 384 (26%) patients in the tofacitinib monotherapy group, 111 of 376 (30%) patients in the tofacitinib and methotrexate group, and 37 of 386 (10%) patients in the adalimumab and methotrexate group, leading to treatment discontinuation in 23 (6%), 26 (7%) and 36 (9%) patients in each group, respectively. These data suggest that, in patients with RA with inadequate response to methotrexate, the addition of tofacitinib or adalimumab is as efficacious as switching to tofacitinib monotherapy.

There are currently no data available on the combination of a JAK inhibitor and a biological agent (such as TNF inhibitors) in IBD. The combination of a JAK inhibitor with the gut-specific biological vedolizumab could be a potentially appealing and safe approach, particularly for the treatment of severe IBD, to rapidly induce remission followed by maintenance monotherapy with vedolizumab.

### Conclusions

Cellular responses mediated by the molecular interplay between JAKs and STATs have fundamental roles in both intestinal homeostasis and inflammation. Molecules that interfere with these interactions, particularly those targeting JAK1 and JAK3, have demonstrated promising efficacy and safety profiles for the treatment of IBD, including for patients with loss of response to treatment with TNF antagonists. In contrast to monoclonal antibody therapies for the treatment of IBD, JAK inhibitors are orally bioavailable, have predictable pharmacokinetics and elicit no immunogenicity. Although STAT inhibition could represent an additional therapeutic avenue to target inflammation, no clinical trials have been undertaken for the treatment of IBD to date.

As more drugs enter clinical development and are added to the IBD treatment armamentarium, and as technology advances, the optimization of therapy demands a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and drug modes of action that could support patient selection and treatment stratification. This approach, otherwise referred to as ‘precision’ or ‘personalized’ medicine, has received much attention in the past decade. However, the mechanisms driving disease heterogeneity both between and within patients over time remain poorly understood, substantially limiting our ability to predict optimal patient-specific therapies or responses to these therapies. We propose that an understanding of disease heterogeneity, with an objective to identify key molecular and cellular patterns driving individual disease pathology and behaviour is required to predict the best therapeutic approach (BOX 2). Longitudinal studies that apply higher resolution approaches (for example, single cell ‘omics’) to the analyses of intestinal samples will probably be required to achieve this goal.
