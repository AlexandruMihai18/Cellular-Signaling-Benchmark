Salmonellae interactions with host processes

Doris L. LaRock${}^{1}$, Anu Chaudhary${}^{1}$ and Samuel I. Miller${}^{1-4}$

Abstract | Salmonellae invasion and intracellular replication within host cells result in a range of diseases, including gastroenteritis, bacteraemia, enteric fever and focal infections. In recent years, considerable progress has been made in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms that salmonellae use to alter host cell physiology; through the delivery of effector proteins with specific activities and through the modulation of defence and stress response pathways. In this Review, we summarize our current knowledge of the complex interplay between bacterial and host factors that leads to inflammation, disease and, in most cases, control of the infection by its animal hosts, with a particular focus on *Salmonella* enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. We also highlight gaps in our knowledge of the contributions of salmonellae and the host to disease pathogenesis, and we suggest future avenues for further study.

Microfold cells (M cells): Specialized epithelial cells that phagocytose molecules in the intestinal lumen for transepithelial transport to enable immunological sampling of antigens.

Peyer’s patches: Organized lymphoid regions of the small intestine monolayer that function in immune surveillance and the generation of a localized immune response.

Salmonellae are motile, Gram-negative bacteria that cause enteric diseases in a wide range of animals. The species *Salmonella enterica* comprises over 2,500 serovars, which are classified on the basis of their flagellar and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antigens, and includes both typhoidal and non-typhoidal *Salmonella* (NTS) strains. *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovars Typhi and Paratyphi (the typhoidal serovars) are human-restricted pathogens that cause the systemic disease enteric (typhoid) fever, which is characterized by fever and abdominal pain (BOX 1). The NTS strains, *S. enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Enteritidis and *S. enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium, are pathogens that can infect a broad range of hosts. They cause acute self-limiting gastroenteritis in humans, cattle, swine and poultry, but they can also cause bacteraemia and systemic infection in immunosuppressed hosts, in very young and older individuals and occasionally in healthy adult humans and animals${}^{1}$. Most of the studies discussed in this Review have used *S.* Typhimurium as a model to understand interactions with host cells.

Salmonellae are usually acquired by oral ingestion of contaminated food or water and survive gastric acidity to gain access to the intestinal epithelium. NTS strains elicit inflammatory changes in the intestinal epithelium, including the infiltration of neutrophils and fluid into the intestinal lumen, resulting in inflammatory diarrhoea${}^{2}$. The inflammatory reaction is essential for the release of factors (such as tetrathionate) that can be used as nutritional sources by NTS, which provides the pathogen with a growth advantage over the intestinal microbiota${}^{3,4}$. Salmonellae can be engulfed by phagocytes in the intestinal lumen, which facilitates invasion of the mucosal barrier. The bacterium can induce its own uptake by epithelial cells but it usually traverses the epithelial barrier through microfold cells (M cells) that overlie intestinal lymphoid tissues known as Peyer’s patches${}^{5}$.

Salmonellae can invade and survive inside several mammalian cell types, including macrophages, but they are rapidly cleared by neutrophils${}^{6,7}$. The intracellular lifestyle of salmonellae within epithelial cells and macrophages facilitates the avoidance of neutrophil-mediated killing and is essential for pathogenesis. Intracellular survival requires the bacteria to recognize and resist components of the innate immune system, including cationic antimicrobial peptides and the acidic pH of the phagocytic vacuole. The recognition of host innate immunity by salmonellae results in the transcriptional activation of genes that are important for remodelling of the bacterial cell surface, which promotes intracellular survival${}^{8}$. Sensing of the intracellular environment and subsequent bacterial membrane remodelling are dependent on regulatory proteins, including the two-component systems PhoP–PhoQ, OmpR–EnvZ, PmrA–PmrB, RcsB–RcsC and Cya–Crp${}^{8,9}$. *S.* Typhimurium pathogenesis is also highly dependent on two distinct type III secretion systems (T3SSs) that are encoded on *Salmonella* pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) and SPI-2, which

Box 1 | *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhi

Most of our understanding of Salmonella–host interactions is based on studies using *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium infection of cultured cells and the inbred mouse model. Although the findings of such studies are often generalized to all serovars, much less is definitively known about the interactions between human host cells and the causative agent of typhoid fever, *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhi. S. Typhi causes a human-restricted systemic disease through the acquisition of novel genes and through the loss or inactivation of other genes; for example, the S. Typhi-specific typhoid toxin is a tripartite exotoxin that causes DNA damage and subsequent cell cycle arrest. This is mediated by the active subunit of cytolethal distending toxin, CdtB, which associates with PltA and PltB (which are homologues of pertussis toxin). The tripartite complex is delivered to the extracellular milieu, thereby intoxicating neighbouring cells<sup>193,194</sup>. Secretion of the tripartite toxin is dependent on the muramidase TtsA, which is predicted to bind to peptidoglycan in the cell wall and may mediate secretion of the typhoid toxin through a secretion mechanism that is thought to have evolved from phage endolysins<sup>195</sup>. However, the contribution of the toxin to virulence and host specificity is poorly understood, although its binding to specific carbohydrates may have a role in its localization in host cells. In addition, the absence of the effector GtgE (which cleaves and inactivates RAB29) enables RAB29-dependent vesicular export of typhoid toxin, which contributes to efficient trafficking of the toxin to its targets<sup>196,197</sup>. S. Typhi also expresses a capsular polysaccharide that reduces intestinal inflammatory responses<sup>198,199</sup>. This, in combination with the inability to produce very long O-antigen chains as part of its lipopolysaccharide and the differential regulation of the *Salmonella* pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system, results in a reduced inflammatory response to S. Typhi compared with S. Typhimurium<sup>200</sup>.

Genome reduction contributes to the ability of S. Typhi to cause human-restricted systemic disease. Several virulence factors that are present in serovars that cause gastroenteritis in a broad range of hosts are pseudogenes in S. Typhi and *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Paratyphi<sup>201</sup>. As mentioned above, GtgE is a cysteine protease secreted by non-typhoidal *Salmonella* strains that cleaves specific RAB GTPases in their regulatory switch regions, and this prevents their recruitment to the Salmonella-containing vacuole; however, this protease is absent in S. Typhi. Heterologous expression of GtgE in S. Typhi promotes intracellular replication in human macrophages and survival in non-permissive mouse macrophages<sup>196,202</sup>. Furthermore, the effectors SseJ and SopD2 are absent in S. Typhi, and their loss may contribute to the ability of S. Typhi to cause systemic disease rather than gastrointestinal disease<sup>201,203</sup>. Between 1% and 5% of individuals that become acutely infected with S. Typhi become chronic carriers and actively shed bacteria<sup>204</sup>. S. Typhi can access the gall bladder during acute infection, where it can reside in biofilms for decades and is sheltered from killing by conventional antibiotic treatment<sup>76</sup>. This finding, together with the development of an appropriate animal model for the carrier state, will greatly aid investigations that aim to eradicate the human reservoir. S. Typhi does not naturally replicate in mice, and considerable research into the development of an animal model has led to several models for infection that can provide important insights into this pathogen. These models include humanized mouse models that develop lethal S. Typhi infections; however, the pathological features do not fully reflect human infection<sup>187–189</sup>. Ultimately, human genetics has an important role in susceptibility to infectious diseases, and to truly understand the interaction of S. Typhi with humans there must be a shift from the reliance on cultured cells or mouse cell lines that have genetically similar backgrounds. Perhaps the future lies in more advanced human intestinal and immune cell models (such as the epithelial cell culture system that was developed to produce a panel of cell lines from individuals that showed differential adherence phenotypes for pathogenic *Escherichia coli*) to understand individual responses to S. Typhi<sup>186,205</sup>.

function in the transport of effector proteins to the cytoplasm of the host cell. These effectors target host cell processes to promote invasion and intracellular survival of S. Typhimurium (see Supplementary information S1 (table)). The two T3SSs are encoded at distinct locations on the chromosome, and analysis of the genome suggests that they were acquired by horizontal gene transfer<sup>10</sup>. The need for two distinct T3SSs is probably linked to the differential use of these secretion systems under different environmental conditions, as other transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms could presumably be used to deliver a different set of effectors through a single apparatus.

Following contact with host cells, the S. Typhimurium SPI-1 T3SS transports effector proteins that enable bacterial invasion across the plasma membrane, resulting in the induction of intestinal inflammatory responses. By contrast, the SPI-2 T3SS transports proteins that are important for intracellular survival and vacuolar movement across the membrane of the *Salmonella*-containing vacuole (SCV; see below)<sup>9</sup>. Many effectors that are translocated by the SPI-1 T3SS persist within host cells after bacterial internalization and may also be important for intracellular survival within the SCV<sup>11–16</sup>. In contrast to NTS, S. Typhi does not elicit a pronounced inflammatory response within the host gastrointestinal tract, and several factors that may contribute to such differences are discussed in BOX 1.

Together, the effector proteins that are delivered into the host cell by the two T3SSs promote the entry, survival and replication of bacteria within host tissues. *Salmonellae* induce actin cytoskeleton ruffling and macropinocytosis to promote bacterial uptake into non-phagocytic cells, and the SPI-1 T3SS effectors reverse these changes after entry. Phagocytosis by macrophages also involves macropinocytosis, which occurs through either SPI-1-dependent or SPI-1-independent mechanisms. Macropinocytic uptake of *salmonellae* occurs rapidly, and bacteria initially reside in a spacious phagosomal compartment<sup>17</sup>, which undergoes a maturation process to form a unique compartment that is known as the SCV<sup>18</sup>. *Salmonellae* modify the lipid and protein content of the SCV and induce morphological changes, including cytosolic membrane-associated actin polymerization and endosomal tubulation of the vacuolar membrane, using the SPI-2 T3SS effectors<sup>9</sup>. Although some of the host factors that are manipulated by *salmonellae* effectors released from the SCV are known, many of the eukaryotic targets have yet to be discovered, and the downstream activities of the majority of these effectors are still elusive. Most of the effectors are specifically localized to the SCV, whereas some are localized to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells. Furthermore, effectors can have multiple mammalian binding partners, and their enzymatic activities may require these binding partners or specific post-translocation modifications, which complicates the identification of their specific functions. Understanding the molecular basis of the complex interplay between *salmonellae* effectors and host cells should lead to a greater understanding of the overall strategy that these pathogens use to achieve a successful intracellular lifestyle. Although many questions remain unanswered (despite intense study of these model organisms), in this Review, we summarize what is currently known about the complex interplay between the arsenal of effectors that *Salmonella* spp. secrete and the pathways that are altered in host cells, including cytoskeletal changes, inflammatory responses, membrane modifications, vacuolar trafficking and autophagy.

Figure 1 | Host pathways manipulated by Salmonella spp. during epithelial cell invasion. Following contact with host cells, Salmonella spp. translocate effectors through the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) type III secretion system (T3SS) to mediate invasion. On the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV) and potentially at the plasma membrane, SopB recruits RAB5 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) VPS34 to generate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P). SopB can also recruit annexin A2 (ANXA2) to the membrane, which functions as a platform for actin rearrangements, and SopB also activates RHO GTPase-dependent actin rearrangements. SopE and SopE2 activate host RHO GTPases to promote bacterial internalization by actin reorganization. Activation of RAC1 (conversion of RAC1•GDP to RAC1•GTP) by SopE in particular promotes the recruitment of factors to the host cell membrane (such as the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family WAVE regulatory complex (WRC) and neural WASP (N-WASP)), which promote actin rearrangements at the host cell membrane, proximal to extracellular Salmonella spp. The host ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (ARF1) guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF), ARNO, is activated by binding to ARF6 and is recruited to the plasma membrane by PtdIns3P, which is possibly generated by SopB. Activation of ARF1 (conversion of ARF1•GDP to ARF1•GTP) by ARNO promotes WRC-dependent actin polymerization and bacterial uptake. WRC and N-WASP activate actin-related protein (ARP2/3), which results in localized actin polymerization to promote bacterial uptake into non-phagocytic cells. The effectors SipA and SipC promote bacterial invasion through their actin bundling functions. SipA may need to be cleaved into two domains (potentially by caspase 3) for activation. SptP promotes restoration of epithelial cell architecture after bacterial entry by reversing the activation of RHO GTPases.

Invasion of non-phagocytic epithelia

Salmonellae effectors that are translocated by the SPI-1 T3SS are important for bacterial invasion of non-phagocytic epithelia (FIG. 1). The effector protein SopB is an inositol phosphatase that affects several cellular pathways during infection, including membrane ruffling, initiation of M cell development and inhibition of SCV fusion with lysosomes^{13,19–21}. Bacterial invasion is mediated, in part, by SopB activation of RHO GTPase-dependent actin rearrangements at the membrane of the host cell^{22–24}. SopB also recruits annexin A2, which functions as a platform for actin rearrangements^{25}. On the SCV, SopB can generate phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) by recruiting RAB5 and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase VPS34 (REF. 26). SopB decreases levels of acidic lipids on the SCV, which may alter RAB family GTPase trafficking and antagonize SCV fusion with lysosomes^{21}. SopB also influences the ability of the bacterium to transform follicular-associated epithelial cells into M cells through activation of WNT–β-catenin signalling^{20}; the induction of WNT signalling leads to the activation of receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) ligand (RANKL; also known as TNFSF11) and its receptor RANK, which is sufficient to initiate M cell development and can promote invasion of salmonellae^{20}. The distinct activities of SopB are spatiotemporally controlled *in vivo* through monoubiquitylation of distinct residues at specific times during infection, which results in the persistence of SopB on the SCV, but it is removed from the plasma membrane following entry into the host cell^{16,27}.

Reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton is also triggered following activation of the small RHO GTPases RAC1 and CDC42 by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) activity of the SPI-1 effectors SopE and SopE2 (REFS 28–32). Salmonellae effectors trigger localized actin polymerization by influencing recruitment and activation of nucleation-promoting factors of the Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) family (WAVE and neural WASP (N-WASP))^{33,34}.

Figure 2 | Salmonella-induced inflammation promotes pathogen transmission. Localized inflammation in the intestinal tract is important for promoting transmission of salmonellae. Activation of RHO GTPases by the effectors SopB, SopE and SopE2 induces mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, thereby activating nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) and activator protein 1 (AP1), which stimulate production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) to promote transepithelial migration of neutrophils from the intestinal lumen to the intestinal mucosa. SipA activates caspase 3 and may be subsequently cleaved by this protease; cleavage of SipA also promotes transepithelial migration of neutrophils. Caspase 1 is activated by FliC (a flagellin protein), PrgJ (a rod protein of the type III secretion system apparatus) and possibly by the effector SipB in macrophages, which may stimulate the release of IL-1β and IL-18. SopE activation of RHO GTPases can also activate caspase 1 in epithelial cells. Intracellular lipopolysaccharide (LPS) can activate caspase 4 and caspase 5, resulting in the release of mature IL-1β and IL-18, which promote the synthesis of IL-17 and IL-22 by T cells and amplifies inflammation in the intestinal mucosa. SopE also induces the production of nitrate by host cells, which can be used by luminal Salmonella spp. for respiration. Pathogen invasion also induces the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipocalin 2. ROS convert the respiratory by-product thiosulphate (which is generated by the microbiota) into tetra thionate, which can be used by Salmonella spp. (but not the microbiota) for respiration. Lipocalin 2 sequesters the iron siderophore enterochelin from the microbiota, but the Salmonella spp. siderophore salmochelin escapes sequestration. Together, these changes promote outgrowth and transmission of Salmonella spp. that reside in the intestinal lumen. The MAPK inflammatory responses are dampened by the activities of SptP, SpvC, AvrA, SspH1 and GogB, but the mechanistic basis of this is not fully understood. TNF, tumour necrosis factor.

### SPI-1-mediated inflammation

Localized inflammation of the intestinal tract is essential for providing a growth advantage for luminal NTS strains and enhances bacterial transmission through multiple mechanisms<sup>4</sup>. Many of the SPI-1 effectors (including SopB, SopE, SopE2, SipA, SipC and SopA) contribute to intestinal inflammation<sup>44–46</sup> by stimulating production of the pro-inflammatory cytokine interleukin-8 (IL-8) through the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and NF-κB pathways, which destabilizes tight junctions and stimulates neutrophil transepithelial migration into the intestinal lumen<sup>1,47,48</sup> (FIG. 2). Host Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are activated following the sensing of salmonellae components (for example, LPS); this promotes macrophage activation and increased killing by the phagosomal compartment, as well as transcriptional activation of inflammatory caspase genes<sup>49</sup>.

Inflammation in response to salmonellae is also induced by activation of inflammatory caspases: caspase 1 and caspase 11 in mice, and caspase 1, caspase 4 and caspase 5 in humans<sup>50</sup>. Cytoplasmic delivery of the flagellar

filament protein FliC and the rod protein PrgJ by the SPI-1 T3SS apparatus activates caspase 1 in macrophages<sup>51,52</sup> (FIG. 2). Activation of caspase 1 triggers the release of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-18 and IL-1β by macrophages, which in turn promote the release of IL-17 and IL-22 by T cells, thereby amplifying inflammation in the intestinal mucosa<sup>53</sup>. The SPI-1 translocon protein SipB is inserted into the plasma membrane and may migrate to the mitochondria, and the damage that is induced at both sites might also contribute to the activation of caspase 1 (REF. 54). In addition to the role of SopE in the invasion of non-phagocytic cells, its GEF activity for the RHO GTPases RAC and CDC42 can activate caspase 1 in stromal cells, which elicits gut inflammation during infection, probably as a result of the reorganization of actin in response to bacterial-mediated endocytosis<sup>55</sup>. Caspase 11 in mice and caspase 4 and caspase 5 in humans may have a role in intestinal inflammation and the restriction of NTS through their activation by cytoplasmic LPS, which may be generated by destabilization of the SCV in epithelial cells or by another unknown transport mechanism<sup>50,56</sup>. SipA may also have a direct role in inflammation that is independent of its role in bacterial invasion, by promoting polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration across the intestinal epithelium<sup>57</sup> and by activating caspase 3 in host cells<sup>58</sup>.

**Competition with the intestinal microbiota.** Salmonellae have several mechanisms to compete with the gut microbiota; for example, intestinal inflammation results in luminal accumulation of lipocalin 2 (also known as neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL)) — a host protein that sequesters the bacterial siderophore enterochelin, which is required by the microbiota for the acquisition of iron. By contrast, the salmonellae siderophore salmochelin is not sequestered by lipocalin 2, which provides the pathogen with a growth advantage over other enteric bacteria<sup>59</sup> (FIG. 2). The invasion of cells by salmonellae results in the release of reactive oxygen species (ROS) into the intestinal lumen, and these ROS react with thiosulphate — a respiratory by-product that is generated by the microbiota in the intestinal lumen — to generate tetrathionate. Tetrathionate is used by *Salmonella* spp., but not by the microbiota, as a terminal electron acceptor to support anaerobic or microaerophilic growth<sup>3</sup>. Furthermore, *Salmonella* spp. induce SopE-dependent production of nitrate by the host, which can be used in anaerobic nitrate respiration to enhance the growth of *Salmonella* spp. and other members of the Enterobacteriaceae family<sup>60</sup>. These and other changes enable *Salmonella* spp. to outgrow the intestinal microbiota, and this provides them with the opportunity for more effective transmission owing to increased proliferation in the intestinal lumen.

**Dampening of inflammation after entry.** After entry into host cells, salmonellae reverse actin cytoskeleton rearrangements (which are required for entry) and dampen inflammation using other effectors. The tyrosine phosphatase SptP reverses MAPK-mediated inflammation and IL-8 secretion<sup>61,62</sup>, and it persists during the late stages of infection to dephosphorylate the AAA+ ATPase valosin-containing protein (also known as TER ATPase), which is important for intracellular replication and endosomal tubule formation<sup>15</sup>. Both the SPI-1 effector AvrA and the SPI-1 and SPI-2 E3 ubiquitin ligase effector SspH1 contribute to the downregulation of *Salmonella*-induced IL-8 production by epithelial cells. SspH1 binds to and ubiquitylates the serine/threonine protein kinase N1 (PKN1), and inhibits NF-κB activity<sup>63–65</sup>. The acetyltransferase activity of AvrA can suppress inflammation that is triggered by apoptosis of macrophages and enhance bacterial intracellular survival<sup>66</sup>. Several other effectors target the MAPK and NF-κB pathways to downregulate inflammation. These include AvrA<sup>67,68</sup>, the phosphothreonine lyase SpvC (which increases *Salmonella* spp. dissemination in mice<sup>69</sup>) and the anti-inflammatory effector GogB (which blocks ubiquitylation and degradation of inhibitor of NF-κB (IkB), leading to inhibition of NF-κB pro-inflammatory signalling<sup>70</sup>) (FIG. 2). In addition, the SPI-1 and SPI-2 effector SpvC reduces inflammation by inhibiting the production of IL-8 and tumour necrosis factor (TNF)<sup>71</sup>. Another SPI-1 and SPI-2 effector, SteA, elicits changes in the expression of several genes in HeLa cells — including the activation of genes that regulate extracellular matrix organization, cell proliferation and serine/threonine kinase signalling pathways, and the repression of genes that are involved in the regulation of immune processes, cell death, cell adhesion and cell migration<sup>72</sup>, which suggests that this effector can also modulate inflammation in the host. The effectors SseF, SifA, SspH2, SlrP, PipB2 and SseI can inhibit the migration of dendritic cells<sup>73</sup>, and several of these effectors (SifA, SspH2, SlrP and PipB2), as well as SopD2, SseF and SseG, also inhibit antigen presentation by dendritic cells and T cell proliferation<sup>74</sup>. Collectively, the results of these studies indicate that both the innate immune response and the adaptive immune response of the host are activated and inhibited during the course of *Salmonella* spp. infection.

**Survival and replication within the SCV** For many years, it has been recognized that intracellular salmonellae can exist in both replicative and non-replicative states<sup>75</sup>. In recent years, increased attention has been devoted to the study of non-replicating salmonellae, as they display a reversible, antibiotic-tolerant phenotype and persist following antibiotic treatment. These phenotypic variants, which are known as persisters, seem to arise stochastically and are now more amenable to study owing to the development of new technologies (BOX 2). In addition to antibiotic tolerance, this phenotypic diversity of individual cells during infection is an interesting area for further exploration. *S.* Typhi is of particular interest as this bacterium causes a relapsing infection with a chronic phase, which might be dominated by non-replicating bacteria that are intracellular or in biofilms associated with gall stones and bladder stones<sup>76</sup>. The molecular basis of phenotypic heterogeneity between individual bacteria and SCV variability are areas that require further study to determine whether specific populations of bacteria may have different functions in the infection process.

Box 2 | *Salmonella* spp. persister cells
---

Phenotypic heterogeneity of *Salmonella* spp. populations within endocytic vacuoles was originally documented in the early 1990s and indicated that these populations could be divided into two subpopulations: those that rapidly replicate and those that do not replicate but are still viable<sup>75</sup>. These non-replicating variants are recalcitrant to killing by antibiotics (termed antibiotic tolerance) and are known as persisters. The subject of bacterial persistence is an area of renewed interest owing to the growing number of multidrug-resistant bacteria combined with the dwindling pipeline of novel antibiotics. Persisters arise stochastically owing to the inherent heterogeneity of bacterial populations<sup>206</sup>, and their formation can also be induced following exposure to stresses such as subinhibitory concentrations of antibiotics<sup>207</sup>. Phenotypic heterogeneity in isogenic bacterial populations has been observed frequently, but the mechanisms behind this phenomenon have been difficult to dissect with traditional tools that use bulk methodologies. Bacterial signalling using second messengers, such as cyclic di-GMP, enables a rapid response to changing environmental conditions and is one way in which phenotypic variation can be achieved. A Förster resonance energy transfer-based biosensor has been used to measure the variation in the expression of cyclic di-GMP in individual cells, which has been key to our understanding of how differences in the levels of this factor between cells correlate with phenotypic diversity<sup>208</sup>. The fluorescence dilution technique has also been used to detect persisters by monitoring the growth rate of single cells *in vivo* and has recently been used to examine the emergence of *Salmonella enterica* subsp. *enterica* serovar Typhimurium persisters<sup>192</sup>. Internalization of S. Typhimurium by macrophages was found to rapidly induce the persistence phenotype as a result of vacuolar acidification and nutrient deprivation. Furthermore, the emergence of S. Typhimurium persisters in macrophages was found to be dependent on the Lon protease, which degrades the antitoxins of 14 putative toxin–antitoxin modules, resulting in the derepression of toxin activity and subsequent growth arrest<sup>192</sup>. As persisters can revert back to growth in new environmental conditions, they may have a role in recurring infections. The methods described above and other developing technologies to follow and/or isolate individual cells from a population will greatly enhance our ability to understand phenotypic diversity within isogenic populations.

Despite the challenges that are associated with studying intracellular bacteria and SCV diversity, owing to the large number of transient interactions and modifications that take place, several principles about the SCV within epithelial cells are known. Beginning immediately after its formation in epithelial cells, the SCV undergoes several vacuolar modifications that distinguish it morphologically from typical phagosomal compartments. Although defined functions for the large repertoire of salmonellae SPI-2 effectors remain to be established, these proteins are required for many SCV vacuolar modifications and are involved in microtubule-based vacuolar movement of the SCV in the host cell (FIG. 3). Our current knowledge about the identity, targets and functions of the SPI-1 and SPI-2 effector proteins is detailed in Supplementary information S1 (table). Maturation of the SCV involves transient interactions with early endosomes, which result in the recruitment of early endosomal markers, including the transferrin receptor, early endosomal antigen 1 and the small GTPase RAB5 (REFS 77,78). These markers are subsequently replaced with late endosomal markers and often lysosomal markers that include lysosome-associated membrane proteins (LAMPs), the GTPase RAB7, RAB-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), vacuolar ATPase and cholesterol<sup>77,79–81</sup>. Other lysosomal markers — including mannose-6-phosphate receptor (MPR) and lysobisphosphatidic acid — can be absent from the mature SCV in some cell types (mostly HeLa cells)<sup>80</sup>, although bacteria can survive within the SCV in macrophages despite direct fusion of the SCV with the lysosomal compartment<sup>82</sup>. The observed variation in SCV surface markers in different experimental systems is probably a reflection of whether the SPI-1 T3SS is used for entry (in macrophages), the degree of caspase 1 activation and cell toxicity, as well as the diversity in the secretion of SPI-2 effectors and bacterial gene expression inside the SCV. Despite this complexity and the lack of uniformity in experimental systems, it is likely that modifications of the SCV surface by SPI-2 effectors contribute to intracellular survival.

A major function of the SPI-2 T3SS effector proteins is modification of the endosomal membrane, which is supported by evidence that shows that many of these effectors localize to the SCV (including the best characterized proteins, SifA and SseJ). The main function of SseJ on the SCV is activation of its glycerophospholipid:cholesterol acyltransferase activity (by binding to RHOA) to directly modify the composition of cholesterol and phospholipids in these membranes, which ultimately increases the accumulation of cholesterol esters within lipid droplets in the cytoplasm<sup>83–85</sup> (FIG. 3). The lipid changes on the SCV have the potential to dramatically alter the repertoire of proteins that associate with the SCV; for example, SifA is recruited and functions as a link to connect the SCV to the microtubular network<sup>86</sup>. The effector SseL (a deubiquitinase) prevents the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells, which suggests that it may prevent changes occurring in the lipid composition on the SCV<sup>87</sup>. Many other effectors that localize to the SCV may alter protein or lipid content, but their specific activities are currently unknown. As detailed in Supplementary information S1 (table), proteins such as SspH2 (a ubiquitin ligase with unknown targets) localize to the SCV in non-polarized cells and to the apical surface of polarized epithelial cells, and may function in the removal of host proteins through ubiquitylation. The specific enzymatic activities of the wide array of SPI-2 effector proteins may include manipulation of small GTPases, removal of proteins from the SCV by post-translational modification and inhibition of the trafficking of proteins through endocytic recycling pathways or deubiquitylation, as well as other complex activities, all of which result in a vacuole with unique protein and lipid content.

### Microtubular network
The dynamic network of tubulin polymers that constitute an important component of the cell cytoskeleton. This network is used for intracellular transport, including movement of secretory vesicles and organelles such as the Salmonella-containing vacuole.

### Sorting nexin
A family of proteins characterized by the presence of a phox-homology domain that functions by binding to phosphatidylinositol-3-monophosphate. Sorting nexins associate with the endocytic network and are involved in endocytosis, endosomal sorting and endosomal signalling.

### SPI-2-mediated movement of the SCV
The SCV traffics through the microtubule network to the perinuclear region of non-polarized host cells (such as HeLa cells) in a manner that is dependent on SPI-2 effectors<sup>88</sup> (FIG. 3). Salmonellae induce sorting nexin tubule formation early after invasion, which contributes to the recruitment of RAB7 and LAMP1 (REFS 89,90). RILP links active RAB7 to the motor protein dynein<sup>91</sup>, forming a complex that is important for the centripetal movement of the SCV at the early stages of infection<sup>92,93</sup>. At later stages of infection, the SCV is displaced to the cell periphery, where it could be important for bacterial transfer between epithelial cells<sup>94</sup>. The SPI-2 effector SifA links the SCV to the microtubular network through its interaction with the host SifA and kinesin-interacting protein (SKIP; also known as PLEKHM2), which is

Figure 3 | Salmonella spp. manipulation of host membranes. After invasion, Salmonella spp. reside in a vacuolar compartment that undergoes various surface modifications and alterations that distinguish it morphologically, forming the Salmonella-containing vacuole (SCV). In some cell types (such as epithelial cells), the SCV acquires markers of late endosomal compartments, including lysosome-associated membrane protein 1 (LAMP1), RAB7, vacuolar ATPase and cholesterol. RAB7 interacts with RAB-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) and the microtubular motor protein dynein, and this complex is important for centripetal movement of the SCV in the cell early in infection. Salmonella pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2) effectors (shown in dark red) are released across the SCV membrane into the host cell cytosol by the type III secretion system. These effectors distribute to different locations in the cell and are required for SCV vacuolar modifications and microtubular-based movement, including promoting the dynamic formation of endosomal tubules. Binding of SseJ to RHOA results in direct modification of the lipid content of the SCV and endosomal tubules (producing cholesterol esters), whereas SseL counteracts this activity by decreasing the accumulation of lipid droplets in cells. SseF and SseG promote microtubule bundling and the aggregation of endosomal vesicles, as well as recruiting Golgi-derived vesicles to the SCV. SteC induces actin rearrangements around the SCV and can alter the position of the SCV within the cell, and SopB induces phosphorylation and activation of myosin II indirectly. SopB phosphatase activity reduces the membrane charge of the SCV by preventing the accumulation of RABs, which are important for promoting fusion of the SCV to the lysosome (dashed arrow). SifA binds to the eukaryotic SifA and kinesin interacting protein (SKIP), which activates the microtubular motor protein kinesin to mediate the extension of endosomal tubules. PipB2 is involved in recruiting kinesin to the SCV and endosomal tubules where it may contribute to endosomal tubulation with ARL8B. SifA–SKIP also binds PLEKHM1 (pleckstrin homology domain-containing protein family member 1), which results in the recruitment of the RAB7–HOPS (homotypic fusion and protein sorting) complex to mediate phagolysosomal membrane delivery to the SCV (not shown). SifA binding to RAB7 may disrupt interactions between RAB7–RILP and dynein, which would result in increased peripheral movement of endosomal tubules. SifA binding to RAB9 blocks retrograde transport of mannose-6-phosphate receptors (MPRs) and MPR hydrolyases to the Golgi apparatus, which blocks lysosomal fusion with the SCV. Salmonella spp. manipulate host membranes to direct the SCV towards the nucleus and to then promote movement of the SCV towards the cell periphery, where bacteria are presumably released into the intestinal lumen to infect neighbouring cells.

relocated from the microtubule organizing centre to the SCV⁹⁵. Other SPI-2 effectors, including PipB2 and SseF, bind to the SCV and microtubular motor proteins and may have roles in specific intracellular movement⁹⁶,⁹⁷, which suggests that a major function of SPI-2 could be to move the SCV inside the cytoplasm of the host cell. It is interesting to speculate that this movement along the microtubular network may be directional when bacteria are within polarized epithelial cells that have a specific microtubular orientation.

REVIEW S

Further evidence that SPI-2 effectors function in the manipulation of the microtubular network comes from work with S. Typhimurium, which has shown that the bacterium induces the formation of dynamic LAMP1-positive, microtubule-dependent endosomal tubule extensions, which are historically termed Salmonella-induced filaments (Sifs) ${ }^{98-100}$. The term Sif is somewhat confusing as traditional eukaryotic filaments are actin-based fibres, whereas Sifs are formed by actin-independent, but microtubular-dependent, alteration of endosomal membranes. The SPI-2 effectors SifA, PipB2, SseF, SseG, SseJ, SpvB, SteA and SopD2 all contribute to endosomal tubule dynamics and SCV movement ${ }^{100-106}$. Recruitment of the microtubular motor protein kinesin to the SCV results in endosomal tubule extension, which is dependent on PipB2 (REF. 96) and the host ARF GTPase ARL8B ${ }^{107}$. Kinesin is recruited by the eukaryotic factor SKIP, which is in a complex with SifA ${ }^{86}$ (FIG. 3). SifA also associates with the SCV and endosomal tubules through its carboxy-terminal CAAX motif (C is a cysteine residue, AA are two aliphatic residues and X represents any C-terminal amino acid), which is post-translationally lipidated ${ }^{108,109}$. The SifA–SKIP complex links the SCV to the microtubular network and initiates the fission of periphery-directed transport vesicles, which triggers endosomal tubule formation along microtubules ${ }^{86,110}$ (FIG. 3). SifA may recruit RAB7 to displace the RAB7–RILP–dynein motor complex and thereby increase the peripheral movement of endosomal tubules ${ }^{92}$. In HeLa cells, SifA–SKIP sequesters RAB9 to block RAB9-dependent retrograde trafficking of MPRs, which decreases lysosomal function and promotes bacterial survival ${ }^{111}$. Salmonellae induce tubulation of membranes that are positive for secretory carrier membrane protein 3 (SCAMP3) ${ }^{112}$, a protein that is normally found in the trans-Golgi network, which suggests that the tubular network surrounding Salmonella spp. is derived from both the Golgi apparatus and endosomes. Interestingly, there is evidence that the host secretory pathway communicates with the SCV as S. Typhimurium disrupts exocytosis; this suggests that secretory traffic may be directed to the SCV and contributes to the longevity of the SCV within cells ${ }^{113}$. Although no physiological function has been attributed to membrane tubulation, this process is correlated with the ability of S. Typhimurium to cause disease, as mutations in the genes encoding effectors (such as PipB2, SopD, SopD2, SseJ and SifA) that are required for endosomal tubule formation result in virulence attenuation in inbred mice ${ }^{96,102,114,115}$. The hypotheses that endosomal tubules may be used to collect membrane components and nutrients that are important for Salmonella survival, to dilute lysosomal enzymes or to promote the stability of the SCV membrane, have yet to be experimentally verified. Endosomal tubulation could be a result of effector inhibition of fission, which typically occurs to recycle endosomes back to the plasma membrane, and hence the inhibition of this step might maintain membranes and proteins (that are normally recycled) as components of the SCV.

**Periphery-directed transport vesicles**

Vesicles, such as those from the Salmonella-containing vacuole, that move towards the periphery of cells along microtubules.

**Prenylation**

The attachment of farnesyl or geranyl–geranyl groups to carboxy-terminal cysteine residues that are present in specific prenylation motifs of proteins, which promotes membrane association or protein–protein interactions.

Overlapping functions of effectors

Irrespective of the mechanisms involved, SPI-2 and its effectors promote the replication of S. Typhimurium in bone marrow-derived macrophages from mice and also promote virulence in inbred mice ${ }^{116}$. In the systemic mouse model, strains that lack individual SPI-2 effectors have attenuated virulence, although these single deletions do not lead to the more pronounced attenuation that accompanies inactivation of the SPI-2 T3SS, which suggests that effectors have overlapping and partially redundant functions. Much attention has been devoted to the S. Typhimurium mouse model of infection, in which the importance of individual effectors is measured on the basis of virulence phenotypes. However, the acquisition of effectors rarely has a neutral effect on fitness, and their expression alone suggests that the effector has a pivotal role in pathogenesis. Furthermore, the seemingly partially redundant functions may reflect their differential importance in different animal hosts. Another important and often overlooked variable in experiments using strains that lack specific effectors is the possible increased delivery of other effectors that may mask, enhance or otherwise affect virulence phenotypes. These issues can only be circumvented by testing the effects of point mutations that alter crucial functional residues of the effector, but these studies are only feasible after functions and/or binding partners have been identified. This is best demonstrated by our understanding of the virulence defect of the SifA deletion mutant. Strains that lack SifA have the most pronounced virulence defects ${ }^{117}$, and SseJ and SopD2 promote the release of bacteria into the cytosol in this mutant ${ }^{106,118}$. The presence of cytosolic salmonellae results in rapid bacterial clearance in macrophages owing to the induction of host stress response pathways that are not normally activated in response to intravacuolar bacteria. However, vacuolar integrity is not the only variable that is responsible for the virulence defect of sifA-null bacteria, as the defect is dependent on SopD2 but not on SseJ ${ }^{106,118}$. Other SPI-2 effectors that confer virulence defects when deleted individually are SpvB, SseJ, SseF, SseG, SseI, SopD2, SteA and PipB2 (REFS 97,105,114,115,117,119–122); and other than sseJ, in which a site-directed mutation that confers a loss of activity has been introduced, it is important to interpret these results as preliminary as they could reflect increased delivery of other effectors or secondary effects on other effectors that may contribute to attenuated virulence.

Host modification of effectors. Inside host cells, salmonellae effectors undergo modifications and participate in interactions that are similar to those of host proteins, which enable them to perform their functions by influencing their localization and activity. Lipidation of some effectors has been documented, which probably affects their membrane localization. For example, SifA undergoes prenylation ${ }^{108}$ and SspH2 and SseI are S-palmitoylated ${ }^{123}$. SopB ${ }^{27}$, SptP ${ }^{43}$ and SopA ${ }^{124}$ undergo ubiquitylation, and phosphorylation of AvrA ${ }^{68}$ is important for its activity. In addition, caspase 3 can cleave SipA into two domains, but this occurs extracellularly and not
inside cells where SipA functions; therefore, cleavage by caspase 3 may not be required for SipA function<sup>58</sup>. In the case of SseJ, its enzymatic activity is induced by the host factor RHOA<sup>84</sup> and its localization to endosomal membranes is dependent on its association with RHOA<sup>84</sup>. Co-expression of SseJ and SifA or SseJ and RHOA induces the formation of endosomal tubules in HeLa cells, which supports the idea of cooperativity between these proteins to induce tubulation<sup>95</sup>. The C termini of SifA and SifB have a fold that is similar to those found in GEFs of RHO GTPases, although neither effector has known GEF activity<sup>95</sup>. SifA binds to GDP-bound RHOA<sup>95,125</sup> and promotes the activity of a yeast RHOA homologue (Rho1) on peroxisomes<sup>126</sup>, which suggests that it may regulate SseJ enzymatic activity by activating RHOA<sup>95,125</sup>. Despite having a structural fold that is similar to those found in GEFs, SifA lacks conserved catalytic residues that are important for GEF activity and they differ from those in other bacterial GEFs<sup>127</sup>, which supports the idea that SifA functions as a scaffold for the assembly of other proteins on GTPases; however, a biochemical link between SifA and SseJ remains to be defined.

### Induction of host stress response pathways

The infected host cell responds to alteration of the plasma and phagosomal membranes by activation of specific cellular stress pathways that can restore homeostasis by promoting cellular integrity, the clearance of foreign and damaged cellular components, the initiation of cell death pathways, and the activation of immune responses through cytokine secretion and antigen processing and presentation. Specific mammalian innate immune responses are also activated on recognition of bacterial components — including flagellin, the T3SS, LPS, peptidoglycan components (including muramyl-dipeptide) and bacterial nucleotides — and by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) — including TLRs and NOD-like receptors (NLRs)<sup>128</sup>. In this section, we summarize the current understanding of the inflammasome and autophagy pathways, which are two of the most studied pathways, but it is likely that other pathways (including the unfolded protein response pathway and other endoplasmic reticulum stress pathways) are also induced and directly interact with both the inflammasome and autophagy pathways<sup>129,130</sup>.

#### Peroxisomes

Organelles that degrade long-chain fatty acids in eukaryotes.

#### Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs)

unknown. Cytosolic detection may be most relevant to the induction of innate and acquired immune responses that are related to autophagy and the inflammasome. Deficiencies in autophagy-related genes restrict the replication of intracellular *Salmonella* spp. in the unicellular model organism *Dictyostelium discoideum* and in the multicellular model organisms *Caenorhabditis elegans* and *Drosophila melanogaster*<sup>134</sup>. In the mouse model, autophagy in intestinal epithelial cells protects against dissemination of invasive bacteria<sup>135</sup>. Polymorphisms in the autophagy-related gene *ATG16L1* (which is associated with susceptibility to Crohn’s disease in humans) correlate with reduced clearance of salmonellae in cells and animal models owing to decreased induction of autophagy and increased IL-1β secretion<sup>136,137</sup>. However, these polymorphisms also influence granule formation in Paneth cells in an autophagy-independent manner<sup>138</sup>, suggesting that some of the effects on bacterial clearance may be a consequence of other factors besides the alteration of autophagy. Irrespective of whether NTS escape to the cytoplasm<sup>139</sup> through alteration of the SCV by SPI-2 effectors, it is plausible that autophagy-mediated targeting of the SCV for destruction and its interactions with other host innate immune defence pathways have an effect on host clearance of NTS.

Cellular models have shown that damaged SCVs and cytosolic bacteria can be targeted for autophagic degradation (FIG. 4), as they recruit autophagosomes through ubiquitin–LC3 (also known as MAP1LC3) adaptor proteins, such as p62 (also known as sequestosome 1 (SQSTM1)) and nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52; also known as CALCOCO2)<sup>140</sup>. Phosphorylation of the adaptor protein optineurin (OPTN) by TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) can also promote autophagy of ubiquitin-coated cytosolic salmonellae<sup>141</sup>. Ubiquitylation results in the recruitment of additional components of the autophagy machinery, including the ATG16L1 complex, the Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) complex and ATG9L1, around cytosolic salmonellae<sup>140,142–144</sup>. Furthermore, damage to the SCV membrane promotes the accumulation of galectin 3 and galectin 8, which recruit NDP52 to initiate autophagy<sup>145</sup>. The lipid second messenger diacylglycerol (DAG) is also observed on damaged SCVs independently of ubiquitin accumulation<sup>146</sup>. DAG activation can also activate p62 and protein kinase Cδ to induce the production of ROS through NOX2 (an NADPH oxidase) complex assembly<sup>146</sup>. These host factors contribute to autophagic clearance of cytosolic bacteria and damaged SCVs, but salmonellae use counteractive mechanisms to subvert this process. The reactivation and recruitment of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) to SCVs, which occur following the acute and transient amino acid starvation response that is induced on infection, inhibit the induction of autophagy and possibly provide an escape mechanism for bacteria<sup>147</sup>. It has been suggested that, in macrophages, an unknown SPI-2 effector is involved in the recruitment of focal adhesion kinase to the SCV, which can then activate mTOR through AKT<sup>148</sup>. Furthermore, it is likely that autophagic targeting of damaged or altered SCVs influences antigen presentation as well as

### Activation of autophagy

Autophagy is a metabolic adaptation that is triggered in eukaryotic cells in response to sublethal stress and is characterized by lysosomal degradation of cytosolic components, including bacteria. The role of autophagy in the clearance of salmonellae<sup>131</sup> is unknown, as *Salmonella* spp. largely (and potentially exclusively) reside within the SCV. However, in tissue culture models and inbred mice, a small percentage of NTS escape the vacuole and hyper-replicate, which leads to the extrusion of the infected cell<sup>132</sup>. Data obtained from inbred mouse models suggest that host cell extrusion may be physiologically relevant in restricting intraepithelial proliferation to the intestinal mucosa<sup>133</sup>. However, as host cell extrusion occurs for only a minority of cells, its overall importance in the infectious process is

Figure 4 | Activation of autophagy and the inflammasome in response to infection with Salmonella spp.
Most intracellular Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium initially reside in vacuoles that are converted into Salmonella-containing vacuoles (SCVs; step 1), but in some cellular models of infection, some bacteria escape into the host cytosol following T3SS-mediated damage of the SCV (step 2). Both cytosolic bacteria (step 3) and damaged SCVs (step 4) can be ubiquitylated and are therefore recognized by the bridging adaptors such as nuclear dot protein 52 (NDP52), optineurin (OPTN) or p62, which leads to the recruitment of LC3 and autophagic clearance (step 5 and step 6). Salmonella spp. in turn mediate an acute and transient amino acid starvation response, following which mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is reactivated, thereby inhibiting autophagy. The physiological importance of this for bacterial clearance remains unclear, as most Salmonella spp. remain inside the SCV. Detection of specific bacterial components (such as flagellin, the type III secretion system (T3SS) rod protein PrgJ and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)) in the host cytosol can trigger activation of inflammasome-mediated cell death by caspase 1 and caspase 11 (step 7). In mice, SPI-1-mediated detection of PrgJ and flagellin by the NLR family apoptosis inhibitory protein 2 (NAIP2) and NAIP5, respectively, triggers NOD-, LRR- and CARD-containing 4 (NLRC4)-mediated caspase 1 activation, whereas citrate and potentially bacterial cardiolipin can trigger caspase 1 activation through the NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. The detection of cytosolic LPS in the host can trigger the activation of caspase 11. Activation of caspase 1 and caspase 11 leads to the induction of pyroptosis and elicits the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

the adaptive immune response and autoimmunity, and a deeper understanding of this process should expand our knowledge of chronic human diseases.

Inflammasome activation. In addition to autophagy, activation of the inflammasome can occur following the detection of salmonellae. Inflammasomes are molecular platforms that respond to pathogens and tissue damage by promoting cell death (in a process known as pyroptosis) and pro-inflammatory signalling. Their importance in innate immune defence against salmonellae has been demonstrated in mice that lack key components (such as caspase 1 and caspase 11, and IL-1β or IL-18), which succumb to infection earlier and have higher bacterial loads. Caspase 1 activation by salmonellae can occur through the activation of either the NLRC4 (NOD-, LRR- and CARD-containing 4) or NLRP3 (NOD-, LRR- and pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome, both of which are individually dispensable *in vivo*, which indicates that they have redundant roles early in infection. Coordinated activation of both NLRs sustains the release of IL-1β, which is important for the progression of infection in mice. ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) associates with the inflammasome and is crucial for Salmonella-induced IL-1β secretion. The physiological importance of ASC-containing foci is unknown, as the CARD domain of NLRC4 can directly

interact with the CARD domain of caspase 1, which suggests that ASC may not be required as a linker. However, it has been proposed that ASC might have a role in signal amplification, and activation of NLRP3 and NLRC4 requires ASC *in vitro* ${ }^{153,155,156}$.

The NLRP3 inflammasome can be activated by citrate, which is secreted by S. Typhimurium mutants that lack the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzyme aconitase ${ }^{157}$. Aconitase-deficient salmonellae show reduced acute systemic virulence in mice after oral administration and are defective in their ability to persist. Although mitochondrial cardiolipin is a direct ligand of NLRP3 (REF. 158), it is unknown whether cardiolipin in bacterial membranes (which may be altered by dysregulation of the TCA cycle) can also activate NLRP3. The cardiolipin content of the outer membrane of salmonellae increases in a PhoPQ-dependent manner, which indicates that it might increase in cells in which PhoPQ is activated and that it could be involved in inflammasome activation ${ }^{159}$. Caspase 1 activation by NLRC4 largely depends on the expression of flagellin ${ }^{52,160-163}$; the presence of cytosolic flagellin is sufficient to activate NLRC4, whereas mutation of three conserved C-terminal hydrophobic amino acids in flagellin abolishes recognition ${ }^{161}$. As mentioned above, in addition to flagellin, the inner rod proteins of the salmonellae T3SSs are capable of activating NLRC4. These rod proteins adopt an $\alpha$-helical secondary structure and may oligomerize to form a protein translocation channel ${ }^{155,164}$. Cytosolic recognition of flagellin and inner rod proteins is mediated by the NLR family apoptosis inhibitory proteins (NAIPs) ${ }^{165,166}$. Mouse NAIP5 directly recognizes flagellin, and mouse NAIP2 recognizes the SPI-1 T3SS rod protein PrgJ but not its SPI-2 homologue SsaI ${ }^{165}$. The ligand specificity of NAIPs is mediated by an internal region that encompasses several nucleotide-binding domain-associated $\alpha$-helical domains ${ }^{167}$, and ligand binding is required for NAIP oligomerization with NLRC4. Unlike the multiple NAIP genes in mice, the human NAIP gene locus comprises only a single full-length orthologue and its product recognizes the salmonellae SPI-1 T3SS needle protein PrgI ${ }^{168}$. Recognition of the T3SS components may be more important than recognition of flagellin, as the T3SSs have a stronger association with bacterial virulence. Variation in the copy number of $N A I P$ has been reported for geographically segregated human populations and could contribute to the variable responses of individuals to infection ${ }^{169,170}$. The redundancy between NAIP5 and NAIP2 as well as between NLRC4 and NLRP3 in the detection of salmonellae may enable the host to activate the caspase 1 pathway despite changes in the expression of pathogen ligands that these complexes recognize; for example, detection may be dependent on NLRP3 when flagellin expression is downregulated during the systemic phase of infection ${ }^{171}$.

Detection of cytosolic salmonellae or direct recognition of cytoplasmic LPS ${ }^{171}$ can also induce inflammasome-mediated cell death by caspase 11 (REFS 172, 173), which is non-essential for the activation of caspase 1 and may reflect a form of inflammasome activation that occurs later in the infection ${ }^{50}$. It is unclear whether caspase 11

interacts with the caspase 1 inflammasome components NLRC4 and ASC ${ }^{173,174}$, but in the absence of caspase 1, caspase 11-mediated cell death seems to be exploited by salmonellae to cause inflammation in the host. Mice lacking caspase 1 are more susceptible to infection with S. Typhimurium than mice lacking both caspase 1 and caspase 11 (REFS 56, 151). Although activation of the inflammasome pathway may be beneficial in defence against cytosolic bacteria ${ }^{50}$, aberrant hyperactivation — possibly when LPS concentrations reach a high level in the cytosol (known as endotoxic shock) — is likely to be detrimental ${ }^{175}$.

**Interactions between stress response pathways.** Recent studies are beginning to unravel the integral coupling of the inflammasome and autophagy pathways. Given that autophagy maintains cellular homeostasis and tightly controls inflammasome activation in the host, it is possible that hyperactivation of inflammasomes occurs when autophagy fails to clear the pathogen. The sensing of pathogens by TLRs, which is important for the upregulation of SPI-2 transcription and formation of the SCV in macrophages ${ }^{49}$, promotes autophagosome formation ${ }^{176-178}$. Ectopic expression of the effector SipA activates NOD1 and NOD2 in epithelial cells ${ }^{179}$, which induce autophagosome formation ${ }^{180}$. In turn, autophagy regulates the transcription, processing and secretion of cytokines (including IL-1$\beta$, IL-1$\alpha$ and IL-18) that are activated by the inflammasome ${ }^{181}$, and autophagosomes can sequester and degrade inflammasome components ${ }^{182}$. Moreover, the inhibition of mitophagy ${ }^{183,184}$ can also trigger inflammasome activation. The control exerted by autophagy on inflammasome components is apparent by its ability to both activate and inhibit caspase 11; activation of caspase 11 requires lysis of pathogen-containing vacuoles by immunity-related GTPases ${ }^{185}$, but interestingly autophagy also counteracts caspase 11 activation, possibly by sequestering bacteria that escape the vacuole and by preventing LPS release into the cytosol. Autophagic clearance of pathogen components in the cytosol may temper overt inflammasome activation, and the timing of all of these events in the host may determine the ultimate outcome.

**Conclusions and future prospects**

Considerable progress has been made in our understanding of how salmonellae intricately adapt host signalling and vesicle trafficking pathways to make the usually inhospitable intracellular environment a replication niche. The discrete functions of many of the numerous salmonellae effector proteins are not fully understood, and it is likely that many of their functions will only be elucidated when their activities are studied in the context of other effectors and in a spatiotemporal context within the host. The pace at which the activities of effector proteins are elucidated is likely to only increase through a more systematic investigation of their functions. Furthermore, much of the work to date has used non-polarized, immortalized cell lines, which greatly confounds our ability to understand the importance of directional movement

within polarized intestinal epithelial cells, as well as the interplay between salmonellae and cell death pathways. Recent advances in the culturing and differentiation of primary epithelial cells from both mice and humans should add to our knowledge of the specific and diverse responses of these cell types to salmonellae<sup>186</sup>. It is most likely that not all of the effectors function in all cell types, and this must be investigated for substantial progress towards understanding the important niches of salmonellae in the host to be made. It is possible that the seemingly redundant functions of effector proteins are important for bacterial survival or replication in different cell types or in different hosts, particularly for those serovars that have a broad host range (such as S. Typhimurium). This would be consistent with data that show that host-restricted serovars (such as S. Typhi) have lost several effector proteins that are potentially important for causing gastrointestinal disease in a diverse range of hosts but are possibly detrimental to causing systemic disease in specific host species. Only a limited number of unique virulence factors have been identified in S. Typhi, which suggests that loss-of-function mutations may have a pivotal role in restricting host range and promoting systemic disease. It is interesting to speculate that many of the S. Typhimurium effectors that S. Typhi lacks are most important within polarized gastrointestinal epithelial cells, as S. Typhi does not typically reside in this niche in human hosts. Research on S. Typhi has obviously lagged behind our understanding of NTS, but the availability of humanized mouse models and advances in studying S. Typhi in human cells should teach us more about the pathogenesis of this human-specific pathogen<sup>187–189</sup>. The increase in the number of whole-genome sequences of S. Typhimurium strains and other non-typhoidal and typhoidal strains that cause systemic or gastrointestinal disease should help to clarify the effector proteins that are involved in determining host range and those that possibly cause different disease manifestations. Similarly, increasing knowledge of the diversity of inflammasome and autophagy pathways in humans should provide important information about human susceptibility to *Salmonella* spp. infection.

Substantial progress has been made in understanding how NTS can outcompete the microbiota to cause disease and disseminate, with induction of inflammation being an important trigger for the release of host factors that promote proliferation. Infection with salmonellae, which has reduced substantially owing to modern hygiene, may have provided a selective pressure for predisposition to increased inflammatory responses during times of increasing population density. Thus, future studies that examine *Salmonella*-host interactions in the context of different human populations will expand our understanding of the role of both the host and the bacterium in pathogenesis. Finally, considerable interest in phenotypic variation of individual salmonellae within host cells and tissues has led to renewed interest in the observation that different populations of bacteria have variable growth rates *in vivo*<sup>190–192</sup>. It will be interesting to examine these diverse populations and the expression profiles of important virulence factors that modify host cell responses, as this should help to elucidate interactions between bacteria in the host in the context of distinct subpopulations. Such studies are expected to improve our understanding of whether bacteria have specialized functions to replicate and resist host defences in specific mammalian niches.
