Enzymes in the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketide antibiotics

Gunter Schneider

Aromatic polyketides are secondary metabolites that afford some of the most common antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs currently in clinical use. Not least because of their medical importance, the biosynthesis of these compounds has attracted considerable interest during the past few years; important advances have been made in the structural and mechanistic characterisation of the enzymes involved. These studies are expected to have implications for the production of novel therapeutic agents by combinatorial biosynthesis.

Introduction

Polyketides comprise a large and diverse class of secondary metabolites produced by many bacteria, fungi and plants [1,2]. Amongst these metabolites are the aromatic polyketides, such as actinorhodins, anthracyclines, tetracyclines and angucyclines. Several of the most commonly used antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs are recruited from this class of compounds, for instance, the antibiotics oxytetracycline and tetracenomycin, and the anthracyclines doxorubicin and aclacinomycin, which are employed in the chemotherapy of cancer. Unfavourable toxicity profiles (leading to serious side effects during chemotherapy) and increasing antibiotic resistance limit the clinical usefulness of presently available polyketide drugs. The chemical synthesis of such compounds is difficult due to their chemical complexity (Figure 1) and alternative routes to the production of non-natural polyketides have been explored. The ‘hybrid antibiotic’ approach, based on gene transfer between different antibiotic-producing species, has been rather successful in producing novel polyketides (for reviews, see [2,3]). The modification of existing enzymes by rational design or directed evolution could potentially expand the repertoire of polyketides available by combinatorial biosynthesis.

esis. The genetics, enzymology and structural biology of the biosynthetic pathways that produce polyketides have therefore attracted considerable interest. Several gene clusters involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides in the genus *Streptomyces*, major producers of polyketide antibiotics, have been characterized [1,4]. The availability of complete genome sequences for two *Streptomyces* species, *S. coelicolor* [5] and *S. avermitilis* [6], has further advanced our knowledge of the genetics of polyketide biosynthesis.

Formation of the carbon scaffold of aromatic polyketides is catalysed by type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) [7,8]. In contrast to type I PKSs, which have active sites within a single, large multifunctional polypeptide, type II enzymes are composed of 5–10 individual enzymes, each encoded by a distinct gene. Assembly of the polyketide backbone requires at least three essential proteins (sometimes referred to as a mini PKS): a β-ketosynthase (KS), a chain length factor (CLF) and acyl carrier protein (ACP). The chain is built up from small α-carboxylated precursor molecules, with acetate as the most common starter unit, and malonyl or methylmalonyl groups as extender units. These building blocks are presented to the PKS as ACP thioesters and the polyketide chain remains covalently linked to ACP during the first steps of the biosynthetic pathway. The polyketide backbone is converted into the multicyclic scaffold by the action of ketoreductases, aromatases, cyclases and other enzymes. In many cases, the aromatic polyketide core is modified by tailoring enzymes, giving rise to the remarkable diversity of secondary metabolites produced in various strains of actinomycetes.

This review focuses on the structures and catalytic mechanisms of enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides that have been published in the past few years. In particular, novel unexpected mechanistic features of some of these enzymes will be highlighted.

Biosynthesis of the aromatic polyketide scaffold

Considerable progress has been made in the structural characterization of the enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic actinorhodin (Figure 2). This octaketide is synthesised by the polymerization of eight malonyl units, delivered to the KS in the form of malonyl-ACP. ACP from the actinorhodin biosynthetic pathway was one of the first proteins involved in the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides whose three-dimensional structure was determined [9], followed later by the

solution structures of ACPs from the oxytetracycline [10] and frenolicin pathways [11]. Malonyl-ACP is produced by the action of malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase (MAT), which transfers malonyl groups used as extender units in chain elongation from malonyl-CoA to ACP. The crystal structure of this enzyme from *S. coelicolor* [12] is very similar to that of its *Escherichia coli* orthologue [13]. The *S. coelicolor* enzyme is monomeric and consists of two domains: a large domain with a fold related to that of α/β hydrolases and a smaller ferredoxin-like domain. MAT catalyzes malonyl transfer with the help of a Ser-His catalytic diad; catalytic Ser97 is located in the conserved sequence motif GHSXG. The conserved His201 participates in proton transfer from the nucleophile (Ser97), but is, in contrast to other α/β hydrolases, stabilized by backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms of Gln250 and Asn253 rather than by an aspartic or glutamic acid side-chain.

A major step forward in our understanding of the structural basis of type II PKS catalysis came from structure determination of the actinorhodin KS-CLF enzyme [14**] (Figure 3). Both the KS and CLF domains show the typical layered αβαβα thiolase fold [15] and are most similar in structure to FabF from *E. coli* [16]. KS-CLF forms a heterodimer and the subunits are related by a pseudo twofold axis. At the subunit interface, a large amphipathic tunnel is formed that will harbour the growing polyketide chain during elongation (Figure 3). The putative active site pocket in CLF is filled by large sidechains and the proposed nucleophile (Ser347) is inaccessible. CLF thus is not able to catalyze chain initiation, and the KS subunit carries out both chain initiation and elongation. During chain elongation, the polyketide must be kept in an environment that prevents spontaneous, unwanted cyclisation reactions. The amphipathic tunnel at the KS-CLF interface permits a linear conformation of a heptaketide, thus keeping the reactive ketide groups apart. Only when the last elongation step occurs does the chain have to fold back to fit into the polyketide tunnel. This places C7 adjacent to C12, thus favouring C7–C12 cyclisation, as observed in actinorhodin. A well-defined water molecule, held in place by hydrogen bonds to the backbone amides of Trp135 and Phe136 (which line the tunnel), is close to the putative C7 carbonyl position and was proposed to act as a general acid by donating a proton to the C7 carbonyl oxygen. However, due to aberrant cyclisation, misfolded polyketide intermediates have been observed in the absence of downstream enzymes, indicating that the regiospecificity of the cyclisation of the first ring is not only controlled by the components of the mini PKS [17].

It is possible that downstream enzymes, such as the ketoreductase, could interact with the ACP bound to KS–CLF and, in this way, influence the positioning of the ketide groups relative to the catalytic water molecule. KS–CLF enzymes from other biosynthetic pathways can synthesize longer polyketide chains. Control of polyketide chain length appears to be mostly conferred by the CLF subunit. Sequence comparisons suggest that amino acid replacements in this subunit will create space, allowing longer chains to grow into the vestigial CLF tunnel [14**].

Once the polyketide backbone is formed, the C9 carbonyl oxygen is reduced by the action of the actinorhodin polyketide reductase (Figure 2). The structure of this homotetrameric NADPH-dependent enzyme reveals the canonical short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (SDR) fold [18*,19*]. The enzyme contains the typical catalytic Ser144-Tyr157-Lys161 triad, suggesting that the general enzymatic mechanism of SDR enzymes [20] also holds for polyketide reductase. For polyketide reduction to occur, ACP carrying the polyketide chain has to dock with the ketoreductase. A most likely interaction surface was found at the entrance of the substrate-binding pocket, involving helices α6 and α7. It is proposed that binding of ACP triggers a conformational change from the closed to the open, active form of the enzyme [18*]. Docking a model of the cyclic polyketide substrate into the active site of the reductase revealed that only the C9 carbonyl group can be positioned suitably for hydride transfer without invoking substantial conformational changes [18*,19*].

The conversion of 6-deoxydihydrokalafungin (6-DDHK) to dihydrokalafungin (DHK) in actinorhodin biosynthesis (Figures 2 and 4) is catalyzed by a small (113 amino acids) unusual monooxygenase, ActVA-Orf6 [21]. This homodimeric enzyme carries out the oxygenation of the polyketide without the assistance of flavins or metal ions, and is a member of a structurally and mechanistically diverse class of enzymes, the ‘cofactorless’ oxygenases [22]. The structural analysis of this enzyme, including complexes with substrate and product analogues, was a particular highlight, with implications for enzyme catalysis in general [23**]. The monomer shows the characteristic ferredoxin fold. The dimer is formed by β-strand swapping between subunits. The active site is located in a pocket between the antiparallel β strands and a layer of α helices (Figure 4). A key feature of the reaction catalyzed by ActVI-Orf6 is the activation of oxygen by the substrate itself. The initial step in the proposed mechanism invokes a proton relay system consisting of Tyr72 and Arg86, which transfers a proton from the substrate to the solvent. The resulting carbanion is then attacked by molecular oxygen in a manner similar to the reaction between reduced FAD/FMN and oxygen in many flavoenzymes. The final step in the mechanism is the

protonation and dehydration of the resulting peroxy intermediate.

Structures of enzymes from the biosynthetic pathways of other aromatic polyketides have also been published. The PKS from the R1128 polyketide pathway is unusual in the sense that it can be primed by a variety of different acyl chains. The crystal structure of the priming ketosynthase ZhuH has been determined in complex with bound acetyl-CoA [24]. The enzyme is a homodimer and the subunit shows the characteristic fold of ketosynthases. Acetyl-CoA is bound in a long channel, in which the CoA group extends from the enzyme surface to the catalytic triad, Cys121-His257-Asn288. Adjacent to the catalytic triad is an acyl-binding pocket, which recognizes the acyl group. A structure-based sequence comparison suggested that, in particular, three key residues at the bottom of this pocket appear to be responsible for the different substrate specificity profiles of priming ketosynthases.

The closure of the last ring in anthracycline and tetracenomycine biosynthesis is catalysed by small (approximately 120 amino acids) polyketide cyclases that are unrelated in structure and, apparently, also in mechanism. Ring closure is an intramolecular aldol condensation (Figure 4), but none of the polyketide cyclases use Schiff base formation or a metal ion for stabilization of the enol(ate) intermediate. Nogalonic acid methyl ester cyclase (SnoaL) catalyses the conversion of nogalonic acid methyl ester to nogalaviketone in the biosynthesis of nogalamycin in *Streptomyces nogalater* (Figure 4) [25]. The structure of this tetrameric enzyme was determined in complex with a product analogue [26**]. The monomer folds into a distorted α+β barrel, first observed in scytalone dehydratase [27]. The ligand is bound in a predominantly hydrophobic pocket located in the interior of the barrel (Figure 4). Most of the ligand–enzyme interactions are hydrophobic and only few hydrogen bonds are formed, several via water molecules. Ligand recognition

and substrate specificity appear to be controlled by the architecture of the binding pocket rather than by specific hydrogen bonds, a feature that seems to be recurrent in anthracycline tailoring enzymes [23**,28,29]. The structure, coupled with site-directed mutagenesis data, suggests a novel mechanism of aldol condensation different from that of the class I and class II aldolases. The conserved residue Asp121 acts as an acid/base catalyst in the reaction, and the enol(ate) intermediate is stabilized by delocalisation of the electron pair of the extended π system of the substrate.

Tetracenomycin F2 cyclase (TcmI) catalyses ring closure in the biosynthesis of the antibiotic tetracenomycin C in *Streptomyces glaucescens*. The enzyme monomer has a ferredoxin-like fold and forms a dimer in the crystal [30*]. The fold of this enzyme is related to that of the monoxygenase ActVA-Orf6 (Figure 4). One major difference between the structures of TcmI and ActVA-Orf6 is an additional β strand adjacent to the first strand in ActVA-Orf6, resulting in different packing of the subunits in the dimer. The location of the active site was inferred from a comparison with ActVA-Orf6. Mutational analysis of four putative active site residues did not, however, reveal any essential catalytic group.

### Modifications of the aromatic polyketide core in anthracycline biosynthesis

The three-dimensional structures of several tailoring enzymes in anthracycline biosynthesis have been published recently [28,29,31,32**]. The aromatic polyketide core, which, for many anthracyclines, is aklavinone, is chemically modified by the action of various enzymes, leading to, for example, methylation, glycosylation and hydroxylation [4]. In one of the last steps in the biosynthesis of the anti-tumour drugs doxorubicin and daunorubicin in *Streptomyces peucetius*, the C4 hydroxyl group of the multicyclic ring system is methylated by DnrK, an S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-dependent carminomycin 4-*O*-methyltransferase [33]. DnrK has the typical small-molecule methyltransferase fold and a SAM-binding site characteristic of these enzymes. The structure of the ternary complex with bound products, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine and 4-methoxy-ε-rhodomycin, suggests an S~N~2 mechanism of methyl transfer [29]. Mutagenesis experiments show that there is no catalytic base in the vicinity of the substrate. Rate enhancement by DnrK appears to be due mainly to orientation and proximity effects. The mechanism of DnrK thus differs from that of the related methyltransferases chalcone O-methyltransferase and isoflavone O-methyltransferase, which use an active site histidine as a catalytic base [34].

In *Streptomyces purpurascens*, two enzymes, RdmB and RdmC, catalyze the steps leading from ε-rhodomycinone glycoside to β-rhodomycinone (Figure 5) [35]. RdmC is a methyl esterase that catalyses the removal of the methoxy group at the C15 position of the polyketide skeleton (Figure 5). The enzyme is a monomer consisting of two domains [28]. The larger domain shows the typical α/β hydrolase fold, containing the sequence motif G-X-S-X-G, which is characteristic of a serine hydrolase active site. The smaller domain is α helical and lies on top of the active site cleft. The anthracycline ligands bind in a hydrophobic cavity and most of the interactions with the enzyme are hydrophobic. Structures of enzyme–product complexes suggest that Ser102 from the Ser102-His276-Asp248 catalytic triad acts as a nucleophile in the reaction, and that the transition state is stabilized by an oxyanion hole formed by the backbone amides of residues Gly32 and Met103 [28].

The next step in rhodomycin biosynthesis is the hydroxylation of 15-demethoxy-ε-rhodomycin to β-rhodomycin, catalyzed by RdmB (Figure 5) [35]. This enzyme is homologous to small-molecule *O*-methyltransferases, with 52% sequence identity to DnrK. RdmB has the methyltransferase fold and binds SAM [31,32**]. Nevertheless, RdmB does not catalyze methyl transfer, but a hydroxylation reaction. The enzyme does not contain any other ligands or cofactors, and the reaction is dependent on SAM and reducing agents (e.g. glutathione). A detailed analysis [32**] revealed that the incorporated oxygen is derived from molecular oxygen and that the positive charge of SAM is required for the reaction. An intermediate corresponding to a perhydroxy compound was detected by mass spectrometry. The data are consistent with a mechanism in which the carbanion formed after decarboxylation of the substrate can activate molecular oxygen in a fashion similar to flavins. The positive charge of SAM may be required to stabilize the carbanion intermediate. This study reveals a novel, previously undescribed, function of SAM as a cofactor in enzymatic hydroxylation reactions. It is of interest to note that RdmB shows some mechanistic similarities to the monoxygenase Act-Orf6. In both cases, the aromatic ring system of the substrate is involved in the activation of molecular oxygen. Structural analysis of enzyme–substrate complexes and comparison with the methyltransferase DnrK suggested that RdmB lacks methyltransferase activity because the positioning of the methyl group of SAM is unfavourable for S~N~2-type methyl transfer to the substrate [32**].

### Biosynthesis of sugar components

The structures of dTDP-glucose 4,6 dehydratase from *Streptomyces venezuelae* in complex with dTDP and of a double mutant with bound NAD⁺ and the substrate dTDP-glucose have been determined to high resolution [36]. This dehydratase is involved in the biosynthesis of the unusual deoxysugar desosamine, bound to macrolide antibiotics with either 12- or 14-membered lactone rings. Homologues of this enzyme are found in other *Streptomyces*

species and are involved in the synthesis of deoxysugars that decorate the polyketide core of anthracyclines [4]. This dimeric enzyme belongs to the SDR family. The mechanistic conclusions are in line with a previous proposal, based on structures of the homologous dTDP-glucose 4,6 dehydratases from *Salmonella enterica* and *Streptococcus suis* [37]. Catalysis by these enzymes involves a complicated set of proton transfer steps from and to the substrate (facilitated by catalytic residues Asp128, Glu129 and Tyr151), elimination of the C6 hydroxyl group, and hydride transfer from the substrate to NAD⁺ and back [36,37].

### Conclusions and future prospects
The structural enzymology of the biosynthesis of aromatic polyketides has made significant progress during the past few years, and it can be expected that several pathways will be completely understood in terms of the three-dimensional structures and mechanisms of the enzymes involved in the near future. New insights into catalysis and regulation have been obtained, and there is every reason to expect novel and exciting chemistry to be discovered in future studies of these biosynthetic pathways. Future work should also settle some of the still unresolved questions, such as the choreography of the assembly of the multicyclic polyketide core. In particular, the factors that determine and control chain length, and the regiospecificity and stereospecificity of ring closure and ring modifications, and the role of downstream enzymes in these processes have to be better understood. Many of the aromatic polyketides require glycosylation for biological activity and the biosynthesis of the carbohydrate building blocks, including the factors that control the glycosylation profile in different pathways, certainly deserves more attention. All these studies will provide the basis for the development of novel enzymes, which could be employed in the *in vivo* production of novel polyketide antibiotics.
