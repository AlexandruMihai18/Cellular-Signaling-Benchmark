Ubiquitination and deubiquitination of receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1) play an important role in the positive and negative regulation of the tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα)-induced nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation. Using a combination of functional genomic and proteomic approaches, we have identified ubiquitin-specific peptidase 21 (USP21) as a deubiquitinase for RIP1. USP21 is constitutively associated with RIP1 and deubiquitates RIP1 *in vitro* and *in vivo*. Notably, knockdown of USP21 in HeLa cells enhances TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination, IκB kinase β (IKKβ), and NF-κB phosphorylation, inhibitor of NF-κB α (IκBα) phosphorylation and ubiquitination, as well as NF-κB-dependent gene expression. Therefore, our results demonstrate that USP21 plays an important role in the down-regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation through deubiquitinating RIP1.

Upon binding of tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα), TNF receptor 1 (TNFR1) recruits several adaptor proteins, including receptor-interacting protein 1 (RIP1/RIPK1) and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2), to form a complex (8, 9). This TNFR1-associated complex initiates the activation of IκB kinase (IKK), which phosphorylates IκB protein and activates NF-κB (10–17).

Protein ubiquitination is a crucial regulatory mechanism in various cellular processes, including cell cycle progression, the DNA damage response, and immune responses (18–20). In the TNFα-induced NF-κB signal transduction pathway, the Lys⁶³-linked polyubiquitination of RIP1 protein mediated by TRAF2 E3 ligase is essential for TNFα-induced IKK/NF-κB activation, whereas phosphorylation of the IκB proteins by activated IKK leads to their Lys⁴⁸-linked polyubiquitination, which labels it for its degradation by the 26 S proteasome (21).

Several deubiquitinating enzymes, including CYLD, A20, Cezanne, ubiquitin-specific peptidase 15 (USP15), and USP31, have been suggested to be involved in the down-regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (22–26). However, it remains unclear how deubiquitination plays a role in the down-regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.

The USPs belong to a subclass of the protein-deubiquitinating enzyme (DUB) superfamily that are categorized into five subclasses based on their ubiquitin-protease domains in the human genome and have been shown to be involved in a broad range of biological activities (27). Even though the USP subclass of DUB represents the bulk of the deubiquitinating enzymes encoded in the human genome, the roles of USP proteins in the TNFα-induced NF-κB signal transduction pathway have not been studied in great detail.

In this study, we used a functional genomic approach to identify the USPs that are involved in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation by screening a library of USPs whose overexpression inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. By combining with a proteomic approach, here we present evidence that USP21 functions as a RIP1 deubiquitinase that deubiquitates RIP1 and down-regulates TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.

lets were washed three times using buffer A, as mentioned before, and buffer B (20 mM HEPES, pH 7.9, 0.4 M NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 20 mM glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na₃VO₄, 10 μg/ml aprotinin, and 10 μg/ml leupeptin) was then added to the nuclear pellets. The resuspension was put on ice for 15 min followed by centrifugation at 12,000 × g for 5 min. The supernatants were collected as nuclear extracts.

**In Vitro Deubiquitination Assay—Wild-type or mutant Myc-tagged USP21 proteins were immunoprecipitated from the transfected HEK-293T cell lysates prepared with Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) Nonidet P-40, 1 mM PMSF, and 1 mM DTT). The immunoprecipitates were washed three times with washing buffer and then incubated with 1.25 μg of either Lys⁴⁸-linked or Lys⁶³-linked polyubiquitin substrates in 15 μl of 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 7.2, containing 1 mM DTT for 2 h or with 15 μl of cell lysates prepared from the FLAG-RIP1-transfected HEK-293T cells in Nonidet P-40 lysis buffer and incubated at 37°C for 2 h. Reaction mixtures were spun down, and the supernatants were analyzed by silver staining and immunoblotting with anti-FLAG (M2) antibodies.**

**Luciferase Reporter Assay—HEK-293T or HeLa cells were transiently co-transfected with an NF-κB-dependent Firefly luciferase reporter and effector plasmids along with the Renilla luciferase plasmid. The cells were harvested in passive lysis buffer after 48 h, and luciferase assays were performed using the Dual Luciferase Reporter Assay system (Promega). The relative luciferase activity was calculated through dividing the Firefly luciferase activity by the Renilla luciferase activity. Data represent three independent experiments performed in duplicate.**

**Establishment of the Stable USP21 Knockdown HeLa Cell Lines—The pSUPER USP21 shRNA retroviral vectors were transfected into the HEK-293T cells with retrovirus packing vector Pegpam3e and RDF vector using FuGENE 6. Viral supernatants were collected after 36 and 48 h. HeLa cells were then incubated with virus-containing medium in the presence of 4 μg/ml Polybrene. Stable cell lines were established after 7 days of puromycin (2 μg/ml) selection. Knockdown of the USP21 was confirmed by real time reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting analysis.**

**RESULTS**

**USP21 Inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB Activation—Protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination have been suggested to play important roles in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (20). To explore whether any member of deubiquitinases in**

the USP subclass is involved in regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation, we first generated a library of mammalian expression vectors that encode 30 USP deubiquitinases. Then we used an NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay to assess the effects of overexpression of each USP on TNFα-induced NF-κB luciferase reporter activity. To avoid the potential inhibitory effect of a tag sequence on deubiquitinase enzymatic activity, we did not put any tag into the deubiquitinase protein coding sequence in this USP expression library. In this screen, as shown in Fig. 1A, USP21 significantly inhibited TNFα-induced NF-κB luciferase reporter activity whereas other USPs had no or less effect. To assess whether the inhibitory effect of overexpression of these USPs on the TNFα-induced NF-κB reporter activity is due to their deubiquitinase activity, we generated expression vectors encoding a USP21 deubiquitinase-deficient mutant by substitution of a cysteine residue in the USP active site with an alanine (C221A) and found that only USP21 wild type, but not deubiquitinase-deficient C221A mutant, abolished the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation in a reporter assay (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that USP21 deubiquitinase activity is required for its inhibitory role in the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. To test further whether USP21 possesses the deubiquitinase activity and whether the cysteine to alanine mutation in the potential active site abrogates its deubiquitinase, we immunoprecipitated the Myc-tagged USP21 wild type and mutant proteins from the cell lysates of the transfected HEK-293T cells and performed an *in vitro* deubiquitination assay with both Lys⁴⁸- and Lys⁶³-linked ubiquitin substrates. In this assay, we found that USP21 wild type but not C221A mutant proteins catalyze the deubiquitination of both Lys⁴⁸- and Lys⁶³-linked ubiquitin (data not shown). Together, our data strongly indicate that USP21 is involved in the down-regulation of the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation through its deubiquitinase activity.

**USP21 Is Associated with RIP1—To determine the molecular mechanism of USP21 function in TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation, we immunoprecipitated the FLAG-tagged USP21 from the lysate of the transfected HEK-293T cells with FLAG-USP21 expression vector and identified the co-immunoprecipitated proteins with FLAG-USP21 by mass spectrometry (Fig. 2A). We found that receptor (TNFRSF)-interacting serine-threonine kinase 1 (RIP1/RIPK1) was one of the major co-immunoprecipitated proteins with FLAG-USP21. The rest of the identified USP21-associated proteins, with the exception of ubiquitin, which are more abundant than RIP1, seem more likely to be nonspecific binding proteins (supplemental Table 1). This result suggests that**

FIGURE 3. **USP21 acts as a RIP1 deubiquitinase.** A, USP21 inhibits RIP1 polyubiquitination. Expression vectors encoding FLAG-RIP1 and HA-ubiquitin were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with control vectors or expression vectors encoding Myc-USP21 wild type (WT), C221A mutant, or CYLD, respectively. FLAG-RIP1 proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated (IP) with anti-FLAG antibodies and immunoblotted (IB) with anti-HA antibodies to detect the presence of ubiquitinated FLAG-RIP1. B, USP21 deubiquitinates RIP1 *in vitro*. HEK-293T cells were transfected with expression vectors encoding FLAG-RIP1, Myc-USP21 WT, and C221A mutant, respectively. Cells were lysed in the lysis buffer containing only PMSF as a protease inhibitor. Myc-USP21 proteins in the cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies and co-incubated with FLAG-RIP1 lysates for 1 h in the deubiquitinating buffer before being analyzed by immunoblotting with the anti-FLAG antibodies to detect the presence of ubiquitinated FLAG-RIP1. C, USP21 inhibits TRAF2- and RIP1- but not TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation. Expression vector encoding TRAF2, RIP1, or TRAF6 as well as NF-κB luciferase reporter and control Renilla luciferase reporter vectors were co-transfected into HEK-293T cells with empty vector or expression vectors encoding USP21 WT or C221A mutant for 48 h. The relative luciferase activity was measured and normalized with the Renilla activity. Error bars indicate ± S.D. in three independent experiments.

USP21 Is a RIP1 Deubiquitinase

RIP1 may be a major USP21-binding protein. To validate the result from the above protein identification analysis by mass spectrometry, the FLAG-USP21 proteins from the HEK293T cells transfected with FLAG-USP21 were immunoprecipitated from cell lysates with anti-FLAG antibody and immunoblotted with anti-RIP1 antibody. In this assay, we found that RIP1 was co-immunoprecipitated with FLAG-USP21 (Fig. 2B). The association between USP21 and RIP1 was also confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation of overexpressed HA-RIP1 and FLAG-USP21 in HEK 293T cells (Fig. 2C) and co-immunoprecipitation of endogenous RIP1 and USP21 in HeLa cells with and without TNFα stimulation (Fig. 2, D and E). Together, these results suggest that USP21 is a RIP1-associated protein.

USP21 Acts as a RIP1 Deubiquitinase—The Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked ubiquitination of RIP1 plays an essential role in TNFα-induced NF-κB activation (21). Our results suggest that the inhibitory effect of USP21 on TNFα-induced NF-κB activation could be through its association with RIP1 and regulation of RIP1 ubiquitination. To test this hypothesis, FLAG-RIP1 and HA-ubiquitin expression vectors were co-transfected with vector control or expression vectors encoding Myc-tagged USP21 wild type or deubiquitinase-deficient C221A mutant as well as CYLD into the HEK293T cells. FLAG-RIP1 proteins were immunoprecipitated with the antibody for FLAG epitope and immunoblotted with anti-HA antibody to detect the presence of ubiquitinated RIP1. As shown in Fig. 3A, USP21 wild type abrogated the RIP1 overexpression-induced ubiquitination of RIP1, whereas the USP21 deubiquitinase-deficient mutant and CYLD failed to do so. Furthermore, overexpression of Myc-USP21 wild type had no inhibitory effect on FLAG-TRAF2 and FLAG-TRAF5 polyubiquitination (supplemental Fig. S2). To confirm the

assay, USP21 wild type but not deubiquitinase-deficient C221A mutant abrogated the ubiquitination of RIP1 (Fig. 3B).

Consistent with this result, co-transfection of FLAG-TRAF2 or FLAG-RIP1 with Myc-USP21 wild type but not the deubiquitinase-deficient mutant in HEK-293T cells resulted in a decreased TRAF2 and RIP1-induced NF-κB activities in a NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter assay, whereas co-overexpression of USP21 failed to inhibit TRAF6-induced NF-κB activation (Fig. 3C). Furthermore, overexpression of USP21 had no inhibitory effect on interleukin 1 (IL-1)-induced NF-κB activation (supplemental Fig. S3). These results strongly suggest that USP21 is a bona fide RIP1 deubiquitinase and inhibits TNFα-but not IL-1-induced NF-κB activation.

USP21 Down-regulates TNFα-induced RIP1 Ubiquitination and IKK/NF-κB Activation—TNFα induces a rapid RIP1 ubiquitination, which is required for TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation (21). To determine whether USP21 is involved in down-regulating TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination, we generated USP21 stable knockdown HeLa cell lines using a retroviral transduction system (Fig. 4A). We then analyzed the effect of USP21 knockdown on TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination. In this assay, we found that TNFα induced a higher level of the RIP1 ubiquitination at the early time points and that this higher level of RIP1 ubiquitination was sustained at the later time points of the TNFα stimulation in the USP21 knockdown cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4A). This result demonstrates that USP21 is involved in terminating TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination in the cells.

FIGURE 5. USP21 negatively regulates TNFα-mediated IL-6 gene expression. A, knockdown of USP21 expression enhances the TNFα-induced NF-κB-dependent IL-6 gene expression. The sh-control and sh-USP21 HeLa cell lines were either untreated or treated with TNFα (10 ng/ml) for the time points indicated. Total RNAs from these cells were extracted. IL-6 transcript levels in the sh-control and sh-USP21 cell lines were measured using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR normalized to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The data are presented as the average of three independent experiments ± S.D. (error bars). B, knockdown of USP21 expression enhances TNFα-induced IL-6 production. The sh-control and sh-USP21 HeLa cell lines were either untreated or treated with TNFα (2 ng/ml) for 24 h. The supernatants from these cell cultures were collected and subjected to the human IL-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay analysis according to the manufacturer's instructions.

above result further, the immunoprecipitated Myc-USP21 wild type and deubiquitinase-deficient mutant proteins from the transfected HEK 293T cell lysates were co-incubated with FLAG-RIP1-transfected HEK 293T cell lysates in vitro. In this

USP21 knockdown HeLa cell lines were first generated after transduction of the HeLa cells with the retrovirus expressing shRNA against USP21 and selected by puromycin. The knockdown effect of USP21 expression was examined by both quantitative reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblotting with anti-USP21 antibodies.

NF-κB luciferase reporter plasmid and Renilla luciferase plasmid were co-transfected into the sh-control and two sh-USP21 HeLa cell lines for 42 h, and then the cells were either untreated or treated with TNFα (1 ng/ml) for 6 h. The relative luciferase activity was measured and normalized with the Renilla activity. Error bars indicate ± S.D. in three independent experiments.

USP21 plays a critical role in the down-regulation of the NF-κB activation at the early phase of TNFα stimulation, probably followed by acting together at the later time points of stimulation with A20 ubiquitin (Ub)-editing complex, including TAXBP1/Itch/RNF11 proteins to terminate NF-κB activation.

TNFα induces a strong NF-κB activation through the phosphorylation and activation of IKK (29). To evaluate the role of USP21 in TNFα-induced IKK/NF-κB activation, we analyzed the effect of USP21 knockdown on TNFα-induced IKK phosphorylation, IkBa phosphorylation, ubiquitination, and degradation, as well as NF-κB RelA subunit phosphorylation at Ser536. As shown in Fig. 4B, TNFα induced an increased level of IKK phosphorylation at the early time points of stimulation, an increased level of IkBa phosphorylation and ubiquitination, as well as an increased level of RelA phosphorylation in the USP21 knockdown cells compared with the control cells. We also found that TNFα induced a higher level of c-Jun N-terminal kinase phosphorylation at the earlier time points of stimulation in the USP21 knockdown cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4B).

Consistent with the above results, TNFα also induced a higher level of the NF-κB-dependent luciferase reporter activity in the USP21 knockdown cells compared with the control cells (Fig. 4C). Taken together, these results suggest that USP21 inhibits TNFα-induced IKK/NF-κB activation by suppressing RIP1 ubiquitination.

**USP21 Inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB-dependent IL-6 Gene Expression—NF-κB activation is necessary for TNFα-induced IL-6 expression (30–32).** To determine the role of USP21 in the regulation of TNFα-induced IL-6 gene expression, we extracted total RNA from the control and USP21 knockdown HeLa cell lines treated with TNFα for the time points indicated and performed quantitative reverse transcription-PCR to examine the TNFα-induced IL-6 expression levels in the cells. As shown in Fig. 5A, TNFα induced a higher level of IL-6 expression in USP21 knockdown cells compared with the control cells. Consistently, TNFα also induced a higher level of IL-6 protein in the cell medium from USP21 knockdown cells compared with the control cells in ELISA (Fig. 5B). These results

DISCUSSION

Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked RIP1 ubiquitination is an essential step in TNFα-induced IKK/NF-κB activation (20, 33). Following TNFα stimulation, RIP1 is promptly ubiquitinated at Lys<sup>377</sup> by TRAF2 E3 ligase within 5 min. RIP1 will be quickly deubiquitinated at the later time points of stimulation, suggesting that tight control of RIP1 ubiquitination is critical for normal TNFα-induced cellular responses. However, the mechanism of RIP1 deubiquitination following TNFα stimulation to attenuate TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination and downstream IKK-NF-κB activation remains to be clearly defined. In this study, we identify USP21 as a major deubiquitinase of RIP1 in the TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. By using a combination of functional genomic screening and proteomic approaches, we demonstrate that USP21 is critical to modulate TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination as well as downstream IKK/NF-κB activation through constitutive association with RIP1 and suppression of Lys<sup>63</sup>-linked RIP1 ubiquitination. Our studies suggest that USP21 serves as another level of critical yin-yang regulatory control to maintain a delicate balance in TNFα-induced inflammatory responses by targeting RIP1.

Our study here suggests that functional genomic screening strategy is a powerful tool to identify the new genes involved in the regulation of TNFα-induced NF-κB activation. However, in this type of screening, we cannot guarantee that USPs are overexpressed at the same level. Therefore, this screening serves only as an initial step to identify the genes whose overexpression significantly inhibits TNFα-induced NF-κB activation.

Interestingly, we found that both A20 and USP21 efficiently inhibited RIP1 overexpression-induced ubiquitination, and both FLAG-tagged USP21 and A20 co-immunoprecipitated
with endogenous RIP1, whereas USP21 pulled down more endogenous RIP1 and was a more efficient RIP1 deubiquitinase in our *in vitro* deubiquitination assay conditions compared with A20 (*supplemental Fig. S1, A, B, and C*). Furthermore, A20 expression and binding to RIP1 can only be detected after 30 min of TNFα stimulation in HeLa cells, whereas USP21 is constitutively expressed and bound to RIP1 (*supplemental Fig. S1D*). Transient knockdown of USP21 but not A20 expression enhanced TNFα-induced RIP1 polyubiquitination in HeLa cells within 15 min of stimulation (*supplemental Fig. S1E*). Notably, TNFα-induced RIP1 polyubiquitination peaks at 5 min and rapidly goes down to the basal level within 30 min (Fig. 2E). However, A20 cannot be detected in HeLa cells within 30 min of TNFα stimulation (*supplemental Fig. S1D*), suggesting that the polyubiquitinated RIP1 induced by TNFα is deubiquitinated by a DUB in the absence of A20 in the cells. Interestingly, knockdown of both USP21 and A20 further enhanced TNFα-induced NF-κB activation compared with single knockdown of USP21 or A20 (*supplemental Fig. S1F*). Together, these results strongly suggest that USP21 is mainly responsible for RIP1 deubiquitination at the early time points of TNFα stimulation, whereas A20 is induced at later time points of stimulation and plays an important “gatekeeper” role in the termination of persistent NF-κB activation in HeLa cells.

The ubiquitin-editing enzyme A20 (also called TNFAIP3) has previously been shown to be a potent inhibitor of NF-κB signaling that consists of an N-terminal deubiquitinating domain of the OTU family and a C-terminal ubiquitin ligase domain and targets RIP1 by cleaving Lys⁶³-linked polyubiquitin chains and promoting Lys⁴⁸-linked polyubiquitination that triggers proteasome-mediated RIP1 degradation (22, 34). Furthermore, A20 has been suggested to be a central gatekeeper in inflammation and immunity (35, 36). In contrast, as a member of the USP subclass, USP21 only contains a DUB domain (27). Recently, A20 has been shown to form a ubiquitin-editing complex with TAXBP1/Itch/RNF11 proteins to modulate the TNFα-induced RIP1 ubiquitination (37–39). Future studies are needed to determine whether USP21 needs other scaffolding molecules to mediate its function to target RIP1 in TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation. In addition, Cezanne has been reported to be involved in the modulation of RIP1 ubiquitination process through binding to RIP1 in a TNFα-inducible manner (23). Future studies should be conducted to determine how USP21 cooperates with A20 and Cezanne to modulate the TNFα-induced RIP1 deubiquitination process.

Previous reports demonstrate that USP21 can be a NEDD-8 protease (40) and a functional deubiquitinase of histone H2A in the regulation of transcriptional initiation (41). These results suggest that USP21 may target proteins other than RIP1.

In conclusion, our results provide direct evidence that USP21 interacts with RIP1 physically and acts as a RIP1 deubiquitinase in the TNFα-mediated NF-κB activation. In view of the data presented here and in previous reports, we propose a working model (Fig. 6) in which TNFα induces RIP1 ubiquitination and NF-κB activation as well as A20 expression. Lys⁶³-linked RIP1 would be rapidly deubiquitinated by USP21 at the early time points of stimulation, followed lately by cooperative action of

the A20 ubiquitin-editing complex, including TAXBP1/Itch/RNF11, to deubiquitinate Lys⁶³-linked RIP1 completely and ubiquitinate RIP1 in the form of Lys⁴⁸-linked ubiquitin to promote RIP1 degradation and terminate the persistent TNFα-mediated IKK/NF-κB activation.
