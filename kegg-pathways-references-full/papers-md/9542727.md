### Abstract

Mechanisms underlying the 5-HT₂A receptor induction of intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization and Ca²⁺ influx in type I astroglial cells in primary culture from newborn rat cerebral cortex were evaluated. The 5-HT-evoked Ca²⁺-transients, inhibited by the 5-HT₂A antagonists ketanserin or 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine oxalate, consisted of an initial peak caused by inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP₃)-mediated Ca²⁺ release from internal stores, and a second sustained part which was due to Ca²⁺ transport over the plasma membrane. The responses were pertussis toxin-insensitive, suppressed by the phospholipase C inhibitor neomycin and were inhibited by the Ca²⁺-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin. Furthermore, the responses were inhibited by the IP₃ receptor antagonist heparin. When the second sustained part of the 5-HT-evoked response was studied, it was concluded that Ca²⁺ influx was not a result of opening of voltage-operated calcium channels of either L, N, or T-type. Instead, it appeared that Ca²⁺ entered the cells through specialized voltage-independent Ca²⁺ channels which were dependent of the IP₃ production and subsequent Ca²⁺ release from internal stores. From this, we conclude that 5-HT opens Ca²⁺ channels in astrocytes which closely resemble depletion-operated Ca²⁺ channels (DOCCs). © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

In the mammalian CNS, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-containing neuronal cell bodies are concentrated in the raphe nuclei, while 5-HT-releasing fibers project to virtually all parts of the CNS. Not all fibers establish synaptic contacts with target neurons, but instead mediate a volume transmission, which is slower than synaptic signaling (Jacobs and Azmitia, 1992). This volume transmission will reach several cellular elements in the brain including glial cells. To date, some 5-HT receptor subtypes have been identified on astroglial cells: the 5-HT₁A receptor (Whitaker-Azmitia et al., 1993; Azmitia et al., 1996), the 5-HT₂A receptor (formerly 5-HT₂) (Hansson et al., 1987; Deecher et al., 1993), the 5-HT₅A receptor (Carson et al., 1996) and the 5-HT₇ receptor (Hirst et al., 1997). The existence of 5-HT₁A receptors on astrocytes is still the matter of controversy (Hillion et al., 1994; Kia et al., 1996). Activation of astroglial 5-HT₂A receptors leads to increases in intracellular inositol (1,4,5) trisphosphate (IP₃) levels triggering the release of intracellular calcium, followed by an influx of calcium via Ca²⁺ channels in the plasma membrane (Nilsson et al., 1991).

The general biochemical mechanisms involved in cell signaling triggering phosphoinositide breakdown are well defined (Berridge, 1993). Hydrolysis of polyphosphoinositides (PI) yields IP₃, which promotes the release of Ca²⁺ from intracellular stores, and production of diacylglycerol (DAG), which, in turn, activates protein kinase C (PKC). Phospholipase C (PLC) is known to mediate the regulation of PI breakdown by guanine nucleotide

binding protein (G protein)-linked receptors. This second messenger cascade might also be involved in the gating mechanisms of plasma membrane Ca²⁺-channels. In many cell types it is shown that stimulation of certain membrane receptors either directly or indirectly leads to the opening of voltage-operated calcium channels (VOCCs) (Tsien and Tsien, 1990). Ca²⁺ influx can also occur through voltage-independent Ca²⁺ channels (VICCs) in non-electrically excitable cells (Kimura et al., 1993; Fasolato et al., 1994; Felder et al., 1994). G protein-coupled receptors can initiate Ca²⁺ influx through at least three different VICC types: (1) receptor-operated calcium channels (ROCCs), which are regulated through a membrane-bound constituent, such as a G protein, or through direct receptor-channel interaction. (2) Depletion-operated calcium channels (DOCCs), which are supposed to be the same as Ca²⁺-release-activated Ca²⁺ channels (CRACs) (Felder et al., 1994). These channels are usually activated by dramatic depletion of IP₃-sensitive stores and are presumably regulated by a cytoplasmic calcium influx factor (CIF) released following depletion of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum (Kostyuk et al., 1992; Fasolato et al., 1994; Felder et al., 1994; Putney and Bird, 1994; Clapham, 1995). (3) Second-messenger-operated calcium channels (SMOCCs), regulated by IP₃, inositol (1,3,4,5)-tetraphosphate (IP₄) and cytoplasmic Ca²⁺.

At present, it is not clear if the 5-HT₂A receptor-induced Ca²⁺ influx in astroglial cells includes opening of any of these channels or if the IP₃-system is involved in the gating of them. Therefore, a study was initiated to further characterize the molecular mechanisms underlying the 5-HT₂A receptor induced influx of Ca²⁺ in type I astroglial cells. The study involves determination of the Ca²⁺ sources of the 5-HT-induced responses and possible interactions between them using fluorometry.

### Experimental procedures

#### Cell cultures

The primary cultures were prepared from newborn rat cerebral cortex, as previously described (Hansson et al., 1984), with some modifications. The cells were grown to confluence on glass coverslips, in 35 mm Petri dishes or on chamber slides in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM/high modified) containing 2 mM L-glutamine, 1% penicillin/streptomycin (PEST) and 20% fetal calf serum (v/v). The cells were cultivated for 2 weeks at 37°C in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO₂ in air, with the pH set at 7.3. The medium was changed 3 times a week.

#### Immunohistochemistry

Immunostaining of the cultured astrocytes (still mounted in the perfusion chamber) was performed according to a previously described procedure (Nilsson et al., 1993). Immunostaining for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) was performed by incubating the cultured astrocytes with antibodies diluted in DMEM containing 20 mM Hepes and 1% bovine serum albumin (DMEM-H-BSA). Nikon diaphot-FXA epifluorescence equipment was used to observe the cultures.

#### Microspectrofluorometry

Recordings were made from a total of 430 single astroglial cells.

The fluorochromes fura-2/AM and fluo-3/AM were used to study intracellular free calcium in individual cells of cultured type I astrocytes. The investigated substances were diluted in Hepes-buffered Hank's balanced salt solution (HHBSS), pH 7.4 (Nilsson et al., 1991). In addition to the below specified concentrations of agonists and antagonists/blockers, both higher (10–100×) and lower (10×) concentrations were tested. 5-HT and the 5-HT₂A antagonists ketanserin (Baxter et al., 1995) and 4-(4-fluorobenzoyl)-1-(4-phenylbutyl) piperidine oxalate (FPPO) (Herndon et al., 1992) were used in concentrations of 0.1–100 μM. Ten μM was found to be optimal for ketanserin and 1 μM for FPPO. Pertussis toxin (PTX), incubated for 24 h, was used in a concentration range between 0.5–5 μg/ml. VOCCs were blocked using a mixture of subtype antagonists for L, N and T-channels. The L, N and T-channel antagonists nifedipine, ω-conotoxin GVIA (ω-CgTx) and ethosuximide were commonly used in the following concentrations, 100 μM, 1 μM and 1 μM, respectively. In experiments when the effects of high extracellular K⁺ were investigated, a final concentration of 56 mM KCl was used. Thapsigargin (0.1 μM) was used to deplete IP₃ sensitive Ca²⁺ pools. Heparin (500 μg/ml), microinjected, was used to block the intracellular IP₃ receptors. When using Ca²⁺-free HHBSS buffer, CaCl₂ was replaced by MgCl₂ and an excess of ethylene glycol-bis (β-aminoethylether) N,N,N′N′-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) (0.05 mM) was added. The fluorochromes were dissolved in dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) and kept frozen at –80°C in the dark until use. The cells were incubated with 10 μM fura-2/AM or fluo-3/AM at 37°C for 45 min in HHBSS together with 0.03% pluronic acid according to a previously described procedure (Nilsson et al., 1993). The Ca²⁺ fluxes in the selected astrocytes were studied using SPEX CM-X micro-spectrofluorometrical equipment interfaced with a Nikon diaphot inverted microscope. After exposure to the various agonists the calcium fluxes in individual cells were detected according to Grynkiewicz et al. (1985). The concentrations of the agonists were maintained in the bath for various times, depending on the shapes of the curves. The cells were then rinsed by a HHBSS (with or without Ca²⁺) flow through the perfusion chamber. Estimations of [Ca²⁺]i (nM) were

made by comparing the experimental 340/380 ratios with  
a calibration curve for free Ca²⁺, obtained by the use of  
a Ca²⁺ calibration buffer kit and the pentapotassium salt  
of fura-2. This *in vitro* calibration method indicated that  
free basal calcium levels in the astrocytes were about 80  
nM (Eriksson *et al.*, 1993; Nilsson *et al.*, 1993). Each  
point of the calibration curve was obtained at 37°C, under  
conditions identical with those in the experimental situation. The cells were viewed with a fluorescence 40× dry  
(0.85 NA) objective and also with a 20× dry phase-  
contrast (0.4 NA) objective. All selected cells were shown  
to emit fluorescence along a stable baseline before being  
stimulated to check that there was neither leakage from  
the probe nor any significant bleaching.

Data are presented in the figures as the 340/380 nm  
ratio of the fluorescence intensities and in nM of the  
intracellular calcium concentration. Light excitation for  
fluo-3 was set at 485 nm and emitted light was collected  
at 535 nm. Changes in [Ca²⁺]ᵢ were measured and expressed as percentage (*F* − *F*₀)/*F*₀, where *F* refers to the  
fluorescence detected at every datapoint and *F*₀ to mean  
fluorescence measured in the cell at rest. Each figure  
represents one typical experiment of, 5–10 experiments  
performed.

### Microinjection

A solution consisting of 0.1 mM of the PLC inhibitor  
neomycin or 500 μg heparin/ml were dissolved in a “potassium injection buffer” composed of 27 mM K₂HPO₄, 8  
mM NaH₂PO₄ and 26 mM KH₂PO₄, pH 7.3 (Enkvist and McCarthy, 1992). Micropipettes were pulled on a  
Narishige PP-83 pipette puller from borosilicate capillaries. The astrocytes were used under the same conditions as described above with HHBSS as extracellular  
buffer. Fura-2/AM was used for the neomycin experiments and fluo-3/AM was used for the heparin experiments. Type I astrocytes were selected on the basis of  
morphological criteria. The injections were performed  
using a Narishige 1M3 micromanipulator connected to a  
Nikon PLI-188 pressure Pico-Injector. The cells were pricked with capillaries at a site close to the nucleus and  
neomycin or heparin was injected. An intermittent flow rate approximated to 1.6 pl/s resulted in a calculated  
injected volume of approximately 0.1 pl. After injection the capillary was kept inside for 4–5 min allowing equilibration through diffusion. Alternatively, the capillary was kept inside the cell throughout the experiment. After this procedure, the cells were allowed to recover for 2–15  
min, after which 10 μM 5-HT was added. In the control experiments, only the “potassium buffer” was injected. To check the viability of the cells after injection, the cultures were exposed to 56 mM potassium wherein the cells exhibited stable calcium responses, which could be elicited repeatedly.

### Results

#### Demonstration of the 5-HT₂A receptor on type I astrocytes in primary culture

##### Immunohistochemistry

The cells tested were GFAP⁺ and morphologically identical (flat, polygonal in shape) to type I astrocytes.

##### 5-HT-induced increases in intracellular Ca²⁺

5-HT was shown to induce several types of changes in intracellular calcium levels, among which the most frequent response consisted of an initial sharp peak followed by a decrease to a lower but sustained level that was maintained in the presence of the agonist (Fig. 1). In calcium-free media the second sustained part was omitted (Fig. 1) (*n* = 5), suggesting that the initial peak relates to intracellular calcium and the second part to calcium influx through the plasma membrane.

5-HT-induced calcium transients were blocked by ketanserin (Fig. 2a) (Nilsson *et al.*, 1991), and by FPPO (Fig. 2b) suggesting that they originated specifically from the activation of astroglial 5-HT₂A receptors. The Gᵢ, Gₒ and Gᵢ inhibitor PTX, incubated for 24 h, did not block the 5-HT-induced calcium transients in any of the concentrations used (*n* = 10). Neomycin, which had to be microinjected directly into the cell, totally inhibited the

Fig. 1. 5-HT (10 μM) induced Ca²⁺ increases in 1.26 mM Ca²⁺ containing and in Ca²⁺ free HHBSS (with 0.05 mM EGTA). In the experiments with Ca²⁺ containing medium there was a rapid rise in intracellular Ca²⁺ followed by a more or less developed sustained plateau of increased [Ca²⁺]i while in the Ca²⁺-free medium the intracellular calcium transients declined back to baseline with no sustained plateau. Interestingly, after addition of 1.26 mM Ca²⁺ to the medium, a slight Ca²⁺ increase was observed which demonstrating the presence of active Ca²⁺ transport over the cell membranes. One typical experiment out of 5 is shown.

calcium responses after 5-HT stimulation (Fig. 3) (n = 6). To check the viability of the cells after neomycin injection, the cultures were exposed to 56 mM potassium wherein the cells exhibited stable calcium responses, which could be elicited repeatedly. No effects on the calcium responses were seen when only injection buffer was administered.

**5-HT-induced calcium responses and possible involvement of VOCCs**

The involvement of VOCCs in 5-HT-induced Ca²⁺ responses was investigated using specific VOCC antagonists. After pre-incubation with a mixture of nifedipine, ω-CgTx and ethosuximide, 56 mM K⁺ failed to induce any rise in [Ca²⁺]i, while addition of 5-HT to the medium induced a Ca²⁺ transient of a similar type that is seen in the absence of the ion channel blockers (n = 6) (Fig. 4a,b). Taken together, the results show that VOCCs are not involved in 5-HT-induced calcium responses in astrocytes.

**5-HT-induced Ca²⁺ transients and involvement of VICCs**

The Ca²⁺-ATPase inhibitor thapsigargin was used to deplete the intracellular calcium pools. Two separate experiments were performed to test the hypothesis of an effect by calcium store depletion on the opening of Ca²⁺-channels in the cell membrane. First, we noted that the sustained part of the thapsigargin-evoked Ca²⁺-curve was inhibited in Ca²⁺-free extracellular media (Fig. 5) (n = 10). Second, in a similar experiment where the pools had been depleted, no 5-HT-induced Ca²⁺ transients were obtained (Fig. 6) (n = 10). The cell viability was checked with exposure of 56 mM K⁺ wherein the cells exhibited stable calcium responses.

The 5-HT stimulated Ca²⁺ influx was caused by the opening of VICCs. This result was further investigated by microinjection of heparin. Heparin blocks the release of calcium from IP₃ sensitive stores (Fasolato et al., 1993). After intracellular application of heparin, the astrocytes were stimulated with 10 μM 5-HT, and heparin prevented

IP₃-induced Ca²⁺ influx (Fig. 7). In order to test the viability of the cells after this treatment, the cells were incubated in 56 mM K⁺ after which Ca²⁺ transients were obtained, indicating that the cells were reacting normally (n = 10).

### Discussion

The presence of 5-HT₂A receptors on astrocytes in primary cultures is well established (Hansson *et al.*, 1987; Nilsson *et al.*, 1991; Deecher *et al.*, 1993). In the experiments reported here, we used a combination of techniques to evaluate the mechanisms underlying the intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization and subsequent Ca²⁺ influx following the activation of 5-HT₂A receptors. The 5-HT-evoked calcium transients were blocked by ketanserin or FPPO, which shows that the receptors were of the 5-HT₂A type. Taken together, the results clearly indicate the presence of functional 5-HT₂A receptors on the astrocytes in primary cultures.

Stimulation of the astroglial 5-HT₂A receptors leads to a rise in intracellular calcium levels within seconds. The initial part of the calcium response is related to the release from intracellular stores mediated via IP₃. The second, more sustained part is related to an influx of calcium through channels in the plasma membrane. The 5-HT evoked [Ca²⁺]ᵢ responses were not blocked by PTX, suggesting that the 5-HT₂A receptors activate a G protein, which is PTX insensitive, and therefore could be of the Gq subtype (Nakahata *et al.*, 1989; Martin *et al.*, 1991). Further, the 5-HT-evoked calcium rises were blocked by the PLC inhibitor neomycin, which inhibits the formation

of IP₃ by avidly binding polyphosphoinositides and making them inaccessible to PLC (Schwartz et al., 1984; Cockcroft and Thomas, 1992). Thapsigargin elevates the cytosolic Ca²⁺ in various cells (Kimura et al., 1993) by inhibiting the Ca²⁺-ATPase responsible for sequestering Ca²⁺ into the IP₃-sensitive Ca²⁺ pool (Thastrup et al., 1990; Lo and Thayer, 1993). In our cells the mechanisms were the same, i.e. Ca²⁺ was sequestered from the cytoplasm by a thapsigargin-sensitive ATPase. The data suggest that the intracellular stores accumulate Ca²⁺ via an

ATP-dependent Ca²⁺ pump working across the membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. Furthermore, extracellular Ca²⁺ is probably necessary to replenish the cytoplasmic Ca²⁺ pool after depletion. Stimulation with 5-HT also depleted IP₃ sensitive Ca²⁺ stores.

The second sustained part of the 5-HT-evoked calcium transients is caused by influx of extracellular calcium, since this part of the curve was abolished in the absence of external calcium (Fig. 1). Different blockers of voltage-operated Ca²⁺ channels were used when the astrocytes

were stimulated with 5-HT. All these were ineffective in suppressing the sustained cytosolic Ca²⁺ elevation. Consequently, Ca²⁺ channels which open after 5-HT stimulation are voltage-independent.

The release of intracellular calcium and the activation of calcium entry across the plasma membrane are coordinated processes (Putney and Bird, 1994). In non-excitable cells such as the astrocytes, the production of IP₃ that diffuses to the endoplasmic reticulum and causes release of intracellular stored calcium into the cytoplasm may signal the activation of calcium entry. However, the signal for activation of calcium entry is not fully understood. Evidence for the existence of a diffusible cytosolic factor, a Ca²⁺-influx factor (CIF) released in the process of calcium store depletion has been presented by several laboratories (Putney, 1993; Fasolato et al., 1994). This factor might then open specific Ca²⁺ channels in the cell membrane.

Depletion-operated Ca²⁺ channels (DOCCs) could be activated when the intracellular Ca²⁺ pools are depleted. The plasma membrane Ca²⁺ channels are under such conditions opened to enable refilling of the Ca²⁺ pools. These channels have been extensively studied in mast cells, where they are denoted CRAC, and are activated by receptor agonists coupled to IP₃ production. This led to drastic depletion of intracellular Ca²⁺ stores (Fasolato et al., 1994). Artificial store depletion can be achieved by using thapsigargin (Thastrup et al., 1990). We have shown that when the Ca²⁺ stores had been depleted by thapsigargin, no 5-HT induced Ca²⁺ transients could be obtained. This suggests that opening of Ca²⁺ channels in the plasma membrane after 5-HT stimulation is dependent on the existence of intracellular calcium pools. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of internally applied heparin on Ca²⁺ influx showed that Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores triggered by IP₃ is a necessity for influx through the plasma membrane. This further suggests the notion that calcium channels are involved in the 5-HT responses coupled to the IP₃-sensitive intracellular calcium stores and could be of the DOCC or CRAC type (Fig. 8).

The results demonstrate that the 5-HT₂A receptors on astroglial cells in primary culture are linked to a PTX-insensitive G protein, probably a Gq protein, coupled to PLC. After activation, IP₃ formation is induced and intracellular Ca²⁺ is elevated as a consequence of release from internal stores. The subsequent Ca²⁺ influx through the plasma membrane seems to occur through specialized voltage-independent calcium channels. This last step is activated by pool depletion and is of significance for the refilling of the agonist-sensitive stores and might also be of importance for the recovery of cell excitability.

Fig. 8. 5-HT₂A-induced elevations of [Ca²⁺]ᵢ and subsequent opening of DOCCs in a type-I astrocyte. The pathway involves the IP₃ system which interacts with receptors situated on the endoplasmic reticulum which, in turn, liberate Ca²⁺ and CIF. They cooperate to open DOCCs in plasma membrane allowing Ca²⁺ into the cell. The different steps in the figure follow the above described experimental procedure and the subsequently obtained results.
