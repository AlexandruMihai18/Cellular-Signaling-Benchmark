#### Abstract
The pathogenic processes underlying the selective motor neuron degeneration in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are complex and still not completely understood even in the cases of inherited disease caused by mutations in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase-dependent (SOD1) gene. Recent evidence supports the view that ALS is not a cell-autonomous disease and that glial-neuron cross-talk, throughout cytokines and other toxic factors like the nitric oxide and superoxide, is a crucial determinant for the induction of motor neuron death. This cell-cell interaction may determine the progression of the disease through processes that are likely independent of the initial trigger and that may converge on the activation of intracellular death pathways in the motor neurons. In this review we provide support to the hypothesis that aberrant expression and activity of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases cascade (p38MAPK) in motor neurons and glial cells may play a role in the development and progression of ALS. Increased activation of p38MAPK may phosphorylate neuron-specific substrates altering their physiological properties and it may turn on responsive genes leading to neurotoxicity.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive skeletal muscles paralysis consequent to motor neuron loss, which leads patients to premature death. Most cases of ALS are sporadic in origin but in 10–15% the disease is inherited. About one fifth of the familial cases (FALS) are caused by mutations in the copper-zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) gene on chromosome 21p22. More than 100 mutations have been identified, spread through the entire coding sequence of SOD1 gene, and a few have been reported in about 3% of individuals with sporadic ALS. Transgenic mouse and rat models expressing mutant forms of SOD1 that reproduce the clinical and neuropathological features of the disease are an invaluable help in deciphering the molecular mechanisms underlying ALS [8]. The mechanisms responsible for the loss of motor neurons, although clearly triggered by a genetic malfunction, seem to arise from such a complex molecular interplay that familial ALS can now be considered as a ‘multicellular and multifactorial pathology’.

Cells Synergy Is Required for Motor Neuron Degeneration

It is now accepted that motor neurons are not the exclusive targets of toxicity in the mutant SOD1 mouse models. This hypothesis arises from the observation that when human mutant SOD1 was targeted exclusively to neurons [38] or to astrocytes [20] of transgenic mice, the animals failed to develop motor neuron disease in contrast to those expressing the mutant enzyme ubiquitously. Moreover, chimeric mice containing mixtures of normal and SOD1 mutant-expressing cells showed that toxicity to motor neurons also depended on mutant SOD1 acting within non-neuronal cells [13].

Growing evidence demonstrates the involvement of reactive gliosis in the progression of motor neuron degeneration in SOD1 mutant mice. Microglial activation, as revealed either by immunoreactivity for the complement C3 receptor or by the major histocompatibility-II antigen, occurs focally in the ventral horn of spinal cord of SOD1G93A mutant mice at the early stage of the disease when a minimal loss of motor neurons occurred [2, 21] and remarkably increases and spreads in the intermediate and dorsal horn region with the progression of the disease. Microglial cells appear with round cell bodies and thickened short ramified processes that create a network around vacuolized motor neurons in the ventral horn gray matter. It is likely that such a microglia reaction might actively contribute to disease progression rather than just to carry out a scavenging function to remove dying neurons. Likewise, it has been demonstrated that reactive astrocytes, as detected by increased GFAP immunostaining and hypertrophic morphology, also interact intimately with degenerating motor neurons in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice [26]. Reactive astrogliosis appears in concomitance with the loss of motor neurons in SOD1G93A and SOD1G86R mice [2, 9, 21, 30] whereas it precedes the loss of motor neurons in the spinal cord of SOD1G85R [11] and SOD1G37R mice [14]. These data suggest that glial cells may take part to the initial processes of the motor neuron degeneration in SOD1 mutant mice even if they are likely to be more important in the rapid progression of the disease once they became hypertrophic and highly reactive.

The existence of a functional cross-talk between glial and neuronal cells expressing familial ALS SOD1 mutants throughout the exchange of molecular signals leading to neuronal death was also shown in in vitro models of cultured cells. Using cocultures of human neuroblasts and glioblastoma cells, both expressing different SOD1 mutants, Ferri et al. [16] demonstrated the generation of a vicious cycle between neurons and glial cells leading to neuronal death. They showed that inflammatory reactive glial cells, throughout the release of nitric oxide (NO) and interferon-γ (IFN-γ), induced neurons to enter the apoptotic pathway and release proinflammatory signals back to the glia. Likewise, nerve growth factor secreted by cultured spinal cord astrocytes made reactive by lipopolysaccharide or peroxynitrite treatment, induced the death of p75NTR-expressing motor neurons in culture by a mechanism involving NO and peroxynitrite formation [36].

The concept that death of motor neurons in ALS may be consequent to complex interplay between glial cells and motor neurons is likely true also for the patients with familial and sporadic ALS. In fact, evidence of widespread microglial activation was found in the brain of ALS patients during the evolution of the disease as detected by \[^{11}C\](R)-PK11195 positron emission tomography [48]. In addition, reactive astrogliosis detected from postmortem analysis of ALS patient motor cortex was found independently of the massive neuronal degeneration, suggesting that it was not just a consequence of the cell loss [43]. Microglia and astrocyte cell activation may therefore play a key role in the pathogenesis of the disease.

### Intercellular Signaling in Motor Neuron Degeneration

Activated microglia and reactive astrocytes produce and secrete a variety of soluble factors that are proinflammatory and potentially neurotoxic. They include the pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), interleukins, IFN-γ as well as free radicals such as NO and superoxide reactive species (ROS). Moreover, reactive astrocytes and activated microglia may contribute to the excitotoxic transmission by disruption of the glial glutamate transport [9, 10, 42].

#### TNF-α

Independent groups have demonstrated that different cytokines are transcriptionally upregulated in SOD1 mutant transgenic mice at the presymptomatic stage, prior to massive motor neuron death and this effect increases with the progression of the disease. In particular, TNF-α and its receptor TNFR1 were remarkably activated in a pattern that correlated with onset and progression of pathology.
ralysis in SOD1G93A transgenic mice [22, 23]. High circulating levels of TNF-α and its soluble receptor were also found in sporadic ALS patients' blood [37].

TNF-α displays pleiotropic effects in the central nervous system that include regulation of growth factors and other cytokines, modulation of the synthesis and release of monoamines and uptake of glutamate, modulation of the responsive state of AMPA receptors and effects on a wide range of second messenger signaling pathways in neurons [19]. Moreover, TNF-α was shown to upregulate the intermediate filament peripherin and promote the formation of peripherin aggregates that are found in the axonal spheroids characteristic of ALS [41]. TNF-α also contributes to the control of the immune response and recently it has been reported that chronic stimulation of innate immunity by repeated injection of lipopolysaccharide causes exacerbation of the motor neuron disease in SOD1 mutant mice [32].

TNF-α is formed as a transmembrane precursor protein, from which a soluble form is released by proteolytic cleavage. Soluble TNF-α has similar affinities for both the receptor variants TNFR1 and R2. Both these receptors are constitutively expressed in all neural cell types, although astrocytes and oligodendrocytes predominantly express the TNFR1 [31]. It has been suggested that in neurons, activation of TNFR1 induces cell death whereas activation of TNFR2 is neuroprotective. However, only the combined deletion of both TNF-α receptors in mice was able to prevent motor neuron cell death after facial axotomy in adult mouse [39]. Different downstream signaling pathways of TNF receptor activation have been elucidated so far, such as the nuclear factor-κB (NFκB) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38MAPK) but the precise mechanism of their interaction and how they mediate the effects of TNF-α remain elusive. NFκB, a transcription factor with prominent neuroprotective function, was found to be expressed in astrocytes but not in motor neurons of ALS patients [29]. On the contrary, activation of p38MAPK may play a relevant role in the signaling pathway leading motor neuron to death in ALS, as described later.

TNF-α also binds with low affinity to p75NTR receptor, another death receptor homologous member of the TNFR superfamily [4]. p75NTR normally is not expressed in the motor neurons except during the naturally programmed cell death in the embryonic period but it is re-expressed in the motor neuron of ALS patients [44] and SOD1 mutant mice [36] suggesting that it is likely involved in their death. Upregulation of the expression of p75NTR may depend on the sustained activation of

p38MAPK [51]. Thus, TNF-α may contribute to the progressive motor neuron degeneration through different mechanisms. Interestingly, a series of arachidonic acid 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors that were found to be potent TNF-α antagonists in microglia, significantly extended lifespan and delayed motor neuron deterioration in the SOD1G93A mice [50].

### Interleukins

A remarkable upregulation of IL-1β and IL-6 has also been reported in SOD1G93A and G37R transgenic mice [23, 33]. However, decreased levels of IL-1β in SOD1G93A mice induced by the deletion of caspase 11 gene showed no effect on the disease progression [24]. Likewise, the lack of IL-1β gene in SOD1G37R mutant mice did not modify the disease phenotype [33] suggesting that this interleukin does not play a relevant role in the ALS-like pathogenesis of these mice. On the other hand, the upregulation of IL-1β shown in SOD1G93A mice spinal cord was concomitant with a high activation of the anti-inflammatory IL-1 receptor antagonist (ILRA) which may counteract the potential neurotoxic effect of IL-1β in this mouse model [22].

### Reactive Oxygen Species and Nitric Oxide

The overproduction of reactive superoxide with consequent formation of hydroxyl radicals and proteins, lipids and nucleic acids oxidation is considered to play a major role in the toxicity of mutant SOD1 [15]. In addition, SOD1 shows a high reactivity with peroxynitrite, a cytotoxic NO intermediate, yielding to reactive and toxic nitrating species [5, 12]. Although a major source of ROS and NO is from intracellular compartments, extraneuronal sources of these factors are also critical to neuronal oxidative injury and include microglia and reactive astrocytes as major contributors to their production. In particular a prominent upregulation of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity followed by an increased production of NO has been reported in the anterior horns of spinal cord of SOD1G93A mice in parallel with the loss of motor neurons and the induction of massive gliosis [3]. Activation of iNOS in glial cells may be induced by different factors including glutamate and cytokines and this effect can be mediated by the activation of specific intracellular mitogen-activated protein kinases such as p38MAPK [52]. However, targeted deletion of both iNOS alleles did not change the progression and survival of SOD1G93A mice, suggesting that this factor may induce detrimental effect in concomitance to other mechanisms [45].
p38MAPK Intracellular Signaling and Mechanisms of Motor Neuron Death

The p38 is a member of a large family of serine/threonine kinases that function as critical mediators of signal transduction from diverse extracellular stimuli and regulate fundamental cellular processes. The p38 group kinases comprise different homologues (α, β, γ and δ): the p38α and β being the major isoforms expressed in the central nervous system, while p38γ is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle and the form δ is enriched in lung, kidney, testis, pancreas and small intestine [34]. All these p38 kinases have been implicated in the responses to a variety of cellular stresses including ultraviolet light, hyperosmolality, hypoxia, heat shock, proinflammatory cytokines and excitotoxicity. Many of these stimuli are thought to contribute to the development and progression of ALS. Here we provide evidence in support of the hypothesis that p38MAPK might be implicated in the molecular signaling leading to motor neuron degeneration. A recent in vitro study using primary cultured motor neurons from embryonic mice [40] has demonstrated a programmed cell death pathway, exacerbated by SOD1 mutations, which is triggered by Fas receptor activation. Fas induces cell death through the activation of apoptosis signal regulating kinase 1 (ASK1) and the p38MAPK which in turn induces transcriptional upregulation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase (NOS) and activation of procaspase 8. This Fas-triggered cell death pathway was not found in cell types other than motor neurons.

More recently, we demonstrated a selective accumulation and activation of p38MAPK in the spinal motor neurons of transgenic SOD1 mutant mice at a very early stage of the disease. This effect persisted until the end stage becoming prominent in the reactive glial cells, both astrocytes and microglia [47]. Activation of p38MAPK in motor neurons was confirmed by another group in presymptomatic low expressor SOD1 mutant mice showing a delayed onset of the motor neuron impairment [49]. The same study also showed an increased immunoreactivity for phospho-ASK1, nNOS and active caspase 3 in the motor neurons at the early stage of the disease, further supporting the hypothesis of an involvement of the ASK1-p38-nNOS intracellular pathway in the mechanisms of motor neuron death.

Activation of p38MAPK was shown to induce NOS in motor neuron [49] and glia [52] with consequent overproduction of NO and formation of peroxynitrite. This molecule strongly reacts with tyrosine leading to an increased nitration of different proteins (NT) likely altering their function and/or degradation. In fact, we recently observed a remarkably high NT immunoreactivity in the soluble fraction of spinal cord homogenates of presymptomatic and advanced symptomatic SOD1G93A mice compared to age-matched controls. Proteomic analysis identified specific overnitrated proteins involved in the cellular energy metabolism, chaperone activity and cytoskeleton organization. An intense NT punctate immunostaining was seen selectively in the motor neurons of presymptomatic SOD1G93A mice. With the progression of the disease the NT immunoreactivity further increased and intensely labeled also the reactive glial cells [12]. This is in line with the pattern of activation of p38MAPK in SOD1G93A mice showing an early effect in the motor neuron followed by late activation in reactive glial cell [47]. Thus, we suggest that overactivation of p38MAPK in motor neurons and glial cells of SOD1 mutant mice may lead to an increased activation of NOS which in turn induces overnitration of different proteins causing their irreversible damage and/or functional alterations. However, whether p38MAPK activation is directly linked with the increased nitrotyrosine staining needs to be demonstrated.

Recently, it has been demonstrated that the α isoform of p38MAPK phosphorylates the side-arm domains of middle and heavy neurofilament (NF) chains [1]. Accumulation of phosphorylated neurofilaments represents a pathological feature of ALS motor neurons. Interestingly, we and other groups observed that activated p38MAPK was associated to the presence of phosphorylated neurofilaments in the perikarya and proximal axons of motor neurons of transgenic SOD1 mutant mice and patients with sporadic ALS [1, 6, 47]. Moreover, we found that activated p38MAPK was present in some spinal anterior horn neurons of sporadic ALS patients as filamentous skein-like and ball-like ubiquitinated inclusions [6]. Taken together, these data suggest that this kinase contributes to the aberrant phosphorylation of NF and may play a role in the formation of ubiquitinated skein like inclusions characteristic of this disease.

Activated p38MAPK was also reported to promote cell death by interaction with proteins regulating the mitochondrial integrity such as the members of Bcl2 family. For example, p38MAPK was reported to mediate the translocation of Bax from the cytosol to the mitochondria in neuronal cell lines committed to death by a NO donor [18]. Moreover, in memory B lymphocytes, p38MAPK phosphorylates Bcl2 causing cytochrome c release from mitochondria followed by activation of caspase cascade

Fig. 1. Multifunctional role of p38MAPK in the pathogenesis of ALS. Different toxic stimuli such as an excess of glutamate, cytokines, cell death receptor activators, NO and ROS may induce the activation (phosphorylation) of p38MAPK through an upstream kinase cascade which includes ASK1 and MKK 3,6. Activated p38MAPK may play a role in the death of motor neuron through different potential mechanisms: (i) hyperphosphorylating the neurofilaments and causing their aberrant accumulation; (ii) increasing intracellular levels of NO with consequent increase in protein nitration; (iii) altering the mitochondrial function which may induce release of cytochrome c followed by activation of caspase cascade and cell death. Activation of p38MAPK in the reactive astrocytes and microglial cells at the later stages of the disease may further activate the production of proinflammatory cytokines and NO determining a vicious cycle that likely contributes to propagate the damage to adjacent healthy cells and to progression of the disease.

[46]. Since a remarkable release of cytochrome c was reported in the cytosol of motor neurons from SOD1G93A mice at an early stage of the disease, it is likely that activation of p38MAPK might take part to this phenomenon. Mitochondrial alterations are suggested to be a prime candidate in the toxic gain of function of the mutant protein since one of the earliest alterations so far reported in spinal motor neurons of SOD1G93A mice, before the symptoms onset, is the swelling and vacuolization of mitochondria [7, 25]. Recent studies further strengthen this hypothesis demonstrating that mutant SOD1 accumulates in the intermembrane space of mitochondria and may interact with mitochondrial import pores [27] or with Bcl2 [35] to determine an impairment of these subcellular organelles. Disruption of the mitochondrial function with consequent leakage of cytochrome c and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) is supposed to lead to the apoptotic death of motor neurons [17]. Nevertheless, we never detect TUNEL-positive or morphologically apoptotic motor neurons in SOD1 mutant mice and this was confirmed by other studies on transgenic mice [7, 28, 33]. This suggests that a mechanism alternative to the ‘classic’ apoptotic process is involved in motor neuron death affecting SOD1 mutant mice and perhaps also ALS patients.

In conclusion, the cascade of events leading to cell death in ALS does not seem to occur as a cell-autonomous event but is clearly the final outcome of an intricate interplay among motor neurons, microglia and astrocytes, all of them participating to create a toxic microenvironment. This may propagate the damage to adjacent healthy cells triggering a chain process which leads to the relatively rapid progression of the disease. Activation of p38MAPK signaling pathway may play a key role in this process by inducing the production of proinflammatory cytokines and NO in motor neurons and reactive glial cells. In addition, early activation of p38MAPK in motor neurons may have a detrimental effect through different mechanisms (fig. 1): (i) by hyperphosphorylation of neurofilaments which cause their aberrant accumulation in the perikarya and motor axons; (ii) by inducing NOS with consequent formation of the reactive peroxynitrite, this would induce the overnitration of specific proteins causing their irreversible damage and/or functional alterations, (iii) by modulating the translocation and phosphorylation of Bcl2 members in the mitochondria with

consequent release of cytochrome c and activation of downstream caspase cascade or other effector proteins leading to an atypical apoptotic cell death. p38MAPK may therefore play a relevant role in both the development and progression of the disease and it may be considered as a candidate target for therapeutic interventions with p38MAPK inhibitors.
