Within the last 15 years, multiple new signal transduction pathways within cells have been discovered. Many of these pathways belong to what is now termed ‘the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) superfamily.’ These pathways have been linked to the growth factor-mediated regulation of diverse cellular events such as proliferation, senescence, differentiation and apoptosis. Based on currently available data, exposure of cells to ionizing radiation and a variety of other toxic stresses induces simultaneous compensatory activation of multiple MAPK pathways. These signals play critical roles in controlling cell survival and repopulation effects following irradiation, in a cell-type-dependent manner. Some of the signaling pathways activated following radiation exposure are those normally activated by mitogens, such as the ‘classical’ MAPK (also known as the ERK) pathway. Other MAPK pathways activated by radiation include those downstream of death receptors and procaspases, and DNA-damage signals, including the JNK and P38 MAPK pathways. The expression and release of autocrine growth factor ligands, such as (transforming growth factor alpha) and TNF-$\alpha$, following irradiation can also enhance the responses of MAPK pathways in cells and, consequently, of bystander cells. Thus, the ability of radiation to activate MAPK signaling pathways may depend on the expression of multiple growth factor receptors, autocrine factors and Ras mutation. Enhanced basal signaling by proto-oncogenes such as K-/H-/N-RAS may provide a radioprotective and growth-promoting signal. In many cell types, this may be via the PI3K pathway; in others, this may occur through nuclear factor-kappa B or multiple MAPK pathways. This review will describe the enzymes within the known MAPK signaling pathways and discuss their activation and roles in cellular radiation responses.

The ‘classical’ mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway

‘MAP-2 kinase’ was first reported by the laboratory of Dr Thomas Sturgill in 1986 (Sturgill and Ray, 1986) (Figure 1). This protein kinase was originally described as a 42-kDa insulin-stimulated protein kinase activity whose tyrosine phosphorylation increased after insulin exposure, which phosphorylated the cytoskeletal protein MAP-2. Contemporaneous studies from the laboratory of Dr Melanie Cobb identified an additional 44-kDa isoform of this enzyme, termed ERK1 (extracellular signal regulated kinase) (Boulton and Cobb, 1991). Since many growth factors and mitogens can activate these enzymes, the acronym for this enzyme was subsequently changed to denote mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase. Additional studies demonstrated that the p42 (ERK2) and p44 (ERK1) MAP kinases regulated another protein kinase activity (P90${}^{\mathrm{RSK}}$) (Sturgill *et al.*, 1988), and that they were themselves regulated by protein kinase activities designated MKK1/2 (MAPK kinase; MAP2K), also termed MEK1/2 (mitogen-activated/extracellular-regulated kinase 1/2) (Wu *et al.*, 1992, 1993; Haystead *et al.*, 1993; Robbins *et al.*, 1993). MKK1 and MKK2 were also regulated by reversible phosphorylation. The protein kinase responsible for catalyzing MKK1/2 activation was initially described as the proto-oncogene RAF-1 (Kyriakis *et al.*, 1992; Dent *et al.*, 1992; Haystead *et al.*, 1993). This was soon followed by another MEK1/2 activating kinase, termed MEKK1, which was a mammalian homologue with similarity to the yeast Ste11 and Byr2 genes (Lange-Carter *et al.*, 1993). However, further studies have shown that the primary function of MEKK1 is to regulate the c-Jun NH$_2$-terminal kinase (JNK), rather than the ERK, pathway (Yan *et al.*, 1994) (see the JNK pathway, below).

MEK1, in addition to being regulated by RAF family members, can also be both positively and negatively controlled via phosphorylation at other sites. Cyclin-dependent kinases have been shown to phosphorylate T286 and inhibit MEK1 activity (Rossmann *et al.*, 1994). In contrast, phosphorylation of MEK1 at T292 and S298 by PAK family enzymes downstream of Rac GTPase molecules enhances the interaction of MEK1 and ERK1/2, promoting activation of the ERK molecules (Frost *et al.*, 1996; Coles and Shaw, 2002; Eblen *et al.*, 2002).

utilize compensatory signaling from other MAP3K molecules when RAF-1 expression is completely abolished.

Several studies have demonstrated that the NH2 domain of RAF-1 could reversibly interact with RAS in the plasma membrane, and that the ability of RAF-1 to associate with RAS is dependent upon the RAS molecule being in the GTP-bound state (Moodie et al., 1993; Van Elst et al., 1993). Other findings have proved that the ability of RAF-1 to be activated depends upon RAF-1 translocation to the plasma membrane (Dent and Sturgill, 1994; Leevers et al., 1994) (Figure 1). However, the regulation of RAF-1 activity appears to be more complex than simple membrane translocation, with several additional mechanisms coordinately regulating activity when in the plasma membrane environment (Stokoe and McCormick, 1997; Thorson et al., 1998; Tzivion et al., 1998; McPherson et al., 1999; Yip-Schneider et al., 2000; Light et al., 2002; Jaumot and Hancock, 2001).

Data from several laboratories has suggested that protein serine/threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation play a role in increasing RAF-1 activity when in the plasma membrane environment (Fabian et al., 1993; Dent et al., 1995; Marais et al., 1995). Other studies have suggested that protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms can regulate RAF-1 activity (Cai et al., 1997; Schonwasser et al., 1998). Phosphorylation of S338 by PAK family enzymes, downstream of RHO GTPase and PI3K, has been shown to play a role in the RAF-1 activation process (Sun et al., 2000), which may facilitate RAF-1 tyrosine phosphorylation by Src family members (King et al., 2001). Other investigators have suggested that the lipid second messenger ceramide may be able to play a role in RAF-1 activation (Zhang et al., 1997; Muller et al., 1998).

The initial biochemical analyses of purified RAF-1, grown either in the presence or absence of active H-RAS V12, demonstrated near constitutive phosphorylation of S259 and S621, with constitutive Y340-Y341 phosphorylation when the protein was coexpressed with SRC (Fabian et al., 1993; Morrison et al., 1993). Site-specific modification of S259A resulted in a RAF-1 protein that was ~two-fold more active than the wild-type protein, suggesting that S259 was a negative regulatory site on RAF-1 (Morrison et al., 1993; Dent et al., 1995). More recent studies have shown that phosphorylation of RAF-1 at S259 by either AKT or the cAMP protein kinase (PKA) can inhibit RAF-1 activity and its activation by upstream stimuli (Zimmermann and Moelling, 1999; Yip-Schneider et al., 2000; Reusch et al., 2001; Dhillon et al., 2002). Phosphorylation of RAF-1 at S43 by PKA inhibits the interaction of RAF-1 with RAS, thereby blocking RAF-1 translocation to the plasma membrane and its RAS-dependent activation (Wu et al., 1993). In contrast to RAF-1, the B-RAF isoform does not contain an equivalent to S43, but contains multiple sites of AKT-mediated phosphorylation in addition to the B-RAF equivalent of S259 (Guan et al., 2000). B-RAF may also be activated by cAMP via the RAP1 GTPase that has also been linked to Src

RAF-1 is a member of a family of serine-threonine protein kinases termed RAF-1, B-RAF and A-RAF. All 'RAF' family members can phosphorylate and activate MKK1/2, although the relative ability of each member to catalyze this reaction varies (B-RAF > RAF-1 > A-RAF) (Bosch et al., 1997; Marais et al., 1997). Different growth factors, in a cell-type-dependent manner, have been shown to utilize either RAF-1 or B-RAF to activate the ERK pathway (Tombes et al., 1998). Thus, the 'RAF' kinases act at the level of an MAPK kinase (MAP3K). Of note, we have found in A431 squamous carcinoma cells exposed to doses of ~2 Gy that ionizing radiation activates RAF-1, but not B-RAF (Kasid et al., 1996; Schmidt-Ullrich et al., 1997; Suy et al., 1997). Other studies have shown in fibroblasts with a somatic deletion of exon 2 within the RAF-1 and B-RAF genes, generating nonfunctional proteins, that loss of RAF-1 and B-RAF function reduced growth-factor-induced ERK1/2 activation and enhanced apoptosis (Wojnowski et al., 1997, 1998, 2000). This has also been noted following irradiation of these cells (Suy et al., 2001). Using an inducible deletion system in avian DT40 B cells, the contribution of RAF-1 and B-RAF to B-cell antigen receptor signaling has also been examined. Loss of RAF-1 has no effect on BCR-mediated ERK activation, whereas B-RAF-deficient DT40 cells display a reduced basal ERK activity as well as a shortened BCR-mediated ERK activation. The RAF-1/B-RAF double-deficient DT40 cells show an almost complete block both in ERK activation and in the induction of the immediate-early gene products c-FOS and EGR-1 (Brummer et al., 2002).

These findings are in contrast to studies in embryonic fibroblasts where all RAF-1 exons have been deleted (RAF-1-- cells), and in which growth factor signaling to ERK1/2 has not been altered in the absence of RAF-1 function (Huser et al., 2001). These contrasting findings argue that cells, particularly embryonic fibroblasts, may
tyrosine kinase family members (York *et al.*, 2000; Klinger *et al.*, 2002).

At the same time that RAF-1 was shown to associate with RAS, it was found that growth factors, via their plasma membrane receptors, stimulate GTP for GDP exchange in RAS using guanine nucleotide exchange factors (Li *et al.*, 1993; Olivier *et al.*, 1993). Thus receptor signaling was linked to RAS, which was linked to the RAF/MEK/ERK pathway.

Several groups have shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR, also called ERBB1 and HER1) is activated in response to irradiation of various carcinoma cell types (Balaban *et al.*, 1996; Schmidt-Ullrich *et al.*, 1997; Carter *et al.*, 1998; Kavanagh *et al.*, 1998; Bowers *et al.*, 2001). Radiation exposure in the range of 1–2 Gy, via activation of the EGFR, can activate the ERK pathway to a level similar to that observed by physiologic, growth stimulatory, EGF concentrations (~0.1 nM). Recent publications argue that radiation-induced free radicals play an important role in the activation of ERBB family receptors through the ERK pathway (Leach *et al.*, 2001).

The actions of ERBB receptor autocrine ligands have also been shown to play important roles in the activation of the ERK pathway after radiation exposure. Transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-α) has been shown to mediate secondary activation of the EGFR and the downstream ERK and JNK pathways after irradiation of several carcinoma cell lines (Dent *et al.*, 1999; Hagan *et al.*, 2000). In these studies, radiation caused cleavage of pro-TGF-α in the plasma membrane that led to its release into the growth media. Increasing the radiation dose from 2 Gy up to 10 Gy enhanced both the secondary activation of ERBB1 and the secondary activation of the ERK and JNK pathways, suggesting that radiation can promote a dose-dependent increase in the cleavage of pro-TGF-α, which reaches a plateau at ~10 Gy. It should be noted that in contrast to secondary activation, primary activation of the receptor and signaling pathways appeared to reach a plateau at 3–5 Gy. In addition, signaling by RAS, ERK and P53, the activities of which can be increased following radiation exposure, has been shown in a variety of cell systems to increase the expression of autocrine factors such as HB-EGF and epiregulin (Baba *et al.*, 2000). These findings argue that the activation of ERBB family receptors and the ERK pathway by radiation will be influenced by both the RAS and P53 status (mutant or wild type) of a given tumor cell. Thus, for example, in cells expressing a mutant K-RAS protein such as HCT 116, loss of mutant RAS function lowers basal ERK activity and reduces epiregulin expression (Baba *et al.*, 2000). This in turn correlates with reduced basal and radiation-induced ERK activation.

In addition to playing a role in the activation of the ERK pathway, it is important to note that radiation-stimulated RAF-1 may act upon substrates other than MEK1/2, such as the myosin-phosphatase-binding protein (Broustas *et al.*, 2002). RAF-1 has also been proposed to act as an inhibitor of apoptosis signaling

kinase 1 (ASK1) by binding to ASK1: the inhibitory actions of RAF-1 were reported to be independent of RAF-1 protein kinase activity (Chen *et al.*, 2001a). Antisense oligonucleotides to RAF-1 have been shown *in vitro* and *in vivo* to enhance the radiosensitivity of tumor cells (Gokhale *et al.*, 1999), and it is most likely that loss of RAF-1 expression enhances the toxic effects of radiation by promoting ASK1 activation rather than altering ERK activity.

ERK signaling also has the potential to regulate protein kinases within other growth factor-stimulated pathways. For example, ERK signaling negatively regulates the JNK pathway (see below) and positively regulates the P70 S6 kinase (Reardon *et al.*, 1999; Contessa *et al.*, 2002). ERK signaling has been shown to facilitate P70 S6 kinase activation by growth factors and by both UV and ionizing radiation. In the case of ionizing radiation, this has been linked to enhanced translation of certain promoter sequences.

### The JNK Pathway

The JNK pathway was discovered and described in the early to mid-1990s (Hibi *et al.*, 1993; Derijard *et al.*, 1994). JNK1 and JNK2 were initially described biochemically to be stress-induced protein kinase activities that phosphorylated the NH₂-terminus of the transcription factor c-JUN; hence, the pathway is often called the stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) pathway. Multiple stresses increase JNK1/2 (and the subsequently discovered JNK3) activity including UV- and γ-irradiation, cytotoxic drugs and reactive oxygen species (e.g., H₂O₂). Phosphorylation of the NH₂-terminal sites Ser63 and Ser73 in c-JUN increases its ability to transactivate AP-1 enhancer elements in the promoters of many genes (Yang *et al.*, 1998; Davis, 1999). It has been recently suggested that JNK can phosphorylate the NH₂-terminus of c-MYC, playing a role in both proliferative and apoptotic signaling (Noguchi *et al.*, 1999). In a manner similar to the previously described MAPK pathway, JNK1/2 activities were regulated by dual threonine and tyrosine phosphorylation, which were found to be catalyzed by a protein kinase analogous to MKK1/2, termed stress-activated extracellular regulated kinase 1 (SEK1), also called MKK4 (Derijard *et al.*, 1995). An additional isoform of MKK4, termed MKK7, was subsequently discovered (Tournier *et al.*, 1999). As in the case of MKK1 and MKK2, MKK4 and MKK7 were regulated by dual serine phosphorylation. Recent studies have indicated that AKT can phosphorylate and inhibit the activity of MKK4 (Park *et al.*, 2002).

In contrast to the ERK pathway, however, which appears to utilize primarily the three protein kinases of the RAF family and possibly MEKK1 to activate MKK1/2, at least 10 protein kinases are known to phosphorylate and activate MKK4/7, including the Ste11/Byr2-homologues MKKK1-4, as well as proteins such as TAK-1 and TPL-2 (Lange-Carter *et al.*, 1993;
Yan *et al.*, 1994; Schlesinger *et al.*, 1998). The agonist and cell-type specificity of each MAP3K enzyme in the activation of the JNK pathway is currently under investigation (Figure 1).

Upstream of the MAP3K enzymes is another layer of JNK pathway protein kinases, for example, Ste 20-homologues and low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins of the RHO family, in particular CDC42 and RAC1 (Figure 1) (Yustein *et al.*, 2000; Graves *et al.*, 2001; Chadee *et al.*, 2002). It is not clear how growth factor receptors, for example, ERBB1, activate the Rho family low molecular weight GTP-binding proteins; one mechanism may be via the RAS proto-oncogene, whereas others have suggested via PI3K and/or PKC isoforms (Timokhina *et al.*, 1998; Assefa *et al.*, 1999). In addition, other groups have shown that agonists acting through the TNF-α receptor, via sphingomyelinase enzymes generating the lipid second messenger ceramide, can activate the JNK pathway by mechanisms that may act through Rho family GTPases (Lu and Settleman, 1999).

There appear to be at least three distinct mechanisms by which ionizing radiation activates the JNK pathway. Initial reports demonstrated that radiation-induced ceramide generation and that the clustering of death receptors on the plasma membrane of cells played an important role in JNK activation (Rosette and Karin, 1996; Verheij *et al.*, 1996; Herr *et al.*, 1997; Cremesti *et al.*, 2001). This was linked to a proapoptotic role for JNK signaling following irradiation of cells. Other studies have argued that radiation-induced JNK activation was dependent on the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) and c-ABL proteins (Kharbanda *et al.*, 1998; Bar-Shira *et al.*, 2002; Zhang *et al.*, 2002). Studies by our group of laboratories have shown that low-dose radiation activates JNK in two waves in carcinoma cells (Dent *et al.*, 1999). The first wave of JNK activation was dependent on activation of the TNF-α receptor, whereas the second wave of JNK activity was dependent on the EGFR and autocrine TGF-α. Finally, it is also possible that radiation-induced JNK activation could be a secondary event to the activation of effector procaspases; cleavage of the upstream activator MEKK1 can lead to constitutive activation of this enzyme and the downstream JNK pathway, which in some cell types plays a key role in full commitment to apoptotic cell death (Widmann *et al.*, 1997; Widmann *et al.*, 1998; Schlesinger *et al.*, 2002).

The ERK and JNK pathways also appear to be in a dynamic balance with respect to radiation exposure, with the prosurvival ERK pathway acting to inhibit the proapoptotic JNK pathway (Carter *et al.*, 1998; Reardon *et al.*, 1999; Vrana *et al.*, 1999). Inhibition of the ERK pathway enhanced radiation-induced JNK pathway activation that was dependent, in part, on enhanced signaling through the RAS proto-oncogene. In carcinoma cells, the enhanced JNK activation observed in the presence of ERK pathway inhibition was dependent on signaling from the EGFR. Thus, inhibition of ERK facilitates EGFR/RAS-dependent activation of the proapoptotic JNK pathway.

### The P38 MAPK Pathway

The P38 MAPK pathway was originally described as a mammalian homologue to a yeast osmolarity sensing pathway (Han *et al.*, 1994). It was soon discovered that many cellular stresses activated the P38 MAPK pathway, in a manner not dissimilar to that described for the JNK pathway (Lin *et al.*, 1995). Rho family GTPases appear to play an important role as upstream activators of the P38 MAPK pathway, a role facilitated via several MAP3K enzymes, for example, the PAK family (Holbrook *et al.*, 1996), which regulate the MAP2K enzymes MKK3 and MKK6 (Lee *et al.*, 2001b). At least four isoforms of P38 MAPK exist; these are termed P38 α, β, γ and δ (Kyriakis and Avruch, 2001). There are several protein kinases downstream of P38 MAPK enzymes that are activated following phosphorylation by P38 isoforms including P90<sup>MAPKAPK2</sup> (Maizels *et al.*, 2001) and MSK1/2 (Deak *et al.*, 1998). P90<sup>MAPKAPK2</sup> phosphorylates and activates heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), while MSK1/2 can phosphorylate and activate transcription factors that regulate survival, such as CREB (Wiggin *et al.*, 2002; Kato *et al.*, 2001) Of note, recent studies from our group tend to argue that radiation-induced activation of CREB is dependent on the ERK pathway, rather than P38 signaling (Amorino *et al.*, 2002) (Figure 1).

The role of P38 MAPK signaling in cellular responses is diverse, depending on the cell type and stimulus. For example, P38 MAPK signaling has been shown to both promote cell death as well as enhance cell growth and survival (Juretic *et al.*, 2001; Liu *et al.*, 2001; Yosimichi *et al.*, 2001). The ability of ionizing radiation to regulate P38 MAPK activity appears to be highly variable with different groups reporting either no activation (Kim *et al.*, 2002), weak activation (Taher *et al.*, 2000) or strong activation (Wang *et al.*, 2000; Lee *et al.*, 2002b). This is in contrast to the classical MAPK and JNK pathways, where radiation-induced activation has been observed by many groups, in diverse cell types, and in response to low- and high-radiation doses.

In studies where P38 MAPK activation has been observed following exposure to ionizing radiation, the P38 γ isoform has been proposed to play an essential role in causing radiation-induced G2/M arrest (Wang *et al.*, 2000). In these studies, P38 γ signaling was dependent on expression of a functional ATM protein. In support of this finding, overexpression of constitutively active MKK6 also enhanced cell numbers in the G2/M phase. Other groups have argued that P38α also plays a role in UV radiation-induced G2/M arrest (Bulavin *et al.*, 2002). Collectively, these findings suggest that specific inhibitors of P38 γ may have therapeutic benefits.

In this regard, our laboratories recently demonstrated that the novel cytokine MDA-7 interleukin-24 (IL-24) can enhance the activity of the P38 pathway in melanoma cells, specifically P38 α, and that P38 α activation was causal in the induction of GADD transcription factors and the death response following

MDA-7/IL-24 expression (Sarkar *et al.*, 2002). Furthermore, expression of MDA-7 has been shown to radiosensitize lung carcinoma and glioma cells (Kawabe *et al.*, 2002; Su *et al.*, 2002). Kawabe *et al.* have recently argued that JNK phosphorylation plays a role in MDA-7-induced radiosensitivity, although whether other signaling pathways, such as P38, are also involved in radiosensitization remains to be determined. MDA-7 can promote G2/M arrest in a wide variety of tumor cell types independent of the P53 status, which may play a role in radiosensitization, although this has been disputed. Based on the fact that P38α and γ have the same upstream activators (MKK3 and MKK6), it is very likely that MDA-7 will activate P38γ and promote either a basal or radiation-stimulated increase in cell numbers in G2/M phase, leading to enhanced radiosensitivity.

### The MEK5-ERK5 'big MAP kinase' pathway

The 'big MAP kinase' pathway was first described in 1995 (Zhou *et al.*, 1995). The term 'big' derives from the fact that whereas the molecular masses of ERK1/2 and JNK1/2 are 42/44 and 46/54 kDa, respectively, ERK5 has a mass of ~90 kDa. The upstream activators of ERK5, the MEK5 isoforms, have a molecular mass similar to other MAP2K molecules (English *et al.*, 1995). Of note, however, whereas MEK1 and MEK2 have masses of 44 and 46 kDa, respectively, MEK5α and MEK5β have masses of 40 and 50 kDa, respectively, and appear to localize at different subcellular locations. The response of the MEK5-ERK5 pathway to growth factors such as EGF appears to be very similar to that of the MEK1/2-ERK1/2 pathway, including in many, but not all cell types, a dependency on RAS signaling (Kato *et al.*, 1998; English *et al.*, 1999; Kamakura *et al.*, 1999). Furthermore, MEK5 is also inhibited by the previously described MEK1/2 inhibitors PD98059, U0126, and PD184352 (Figure 2). It appears that PD184352 is more specific at lower concentrations for MEK1/2 than MEK5 (Mody *et al.*, 2001). The MAP3K enzymes recently shown to phosphorylate MEK5, MEKK2, and MEKK3, had been previously linked to signaling through the JNK pathway (Sun *et al.*, 2001). ERK5 has been proposed to phosphorylate and activate the transcription factors MEF2C and SAP1a as well as c-MYC (Kato *et al.*, 1997; Kamakura *et al.*, 1999).

In a manner similar to the ERK1/2 pathway, the ERK5 cascade has been proposed to play a key role in growth factor-stimulated cell growth and in cell survival processes. In growth-factor-deprived PC12 cells, the ERK1/2 and ERK5 pathways appeared to each contribute ~50% of a PD98059/U0126-inhibitable survival signal (Suzuki *et al.*, 2002). RAF-1 also appears competent at enhancing ERK5 signaling by acting as a docking molecule (English *et al.*, 1999): whether these findings are due to the fact that ERK5 specifically interacts with RAF-1-associated proteins, such as

### Radiation and signaling
P Dent *et al*

![Diagram](#)

**Figure 2** Inhibitors of growth factor receptors and intracellular signal transduction pathways. Since growth factor receptors, RAS proteins, and downstream pathways are often activated in tumor cells and by radiation, inhibitors have been developed to block the function of these molecules, thereby slowing cell growth and promoting cell death responses following radiation exposure. Multiple inhibitors for the ERBB family receptors have been developed. Inhibitors of RAS farnesylation (and geranylgeranylation) are in clinical trials, as are inhibitors of the MAPK/ERK pathway. It should be noted that MEK1/2 inhibitors are capable of inhibiting the 'Big' MAP kinase pathway by blocking activation of MEK5. PI3K inhibitors have been tested *in vivo*, but difficulties have emerged with systemic toxicity to these reagents. Geldanamycins are a class of agents that block the function of HSP90 and downregulate protein expression of proteins that bind HSP90, including RAF family members ERBB2 and AKT

HSP90, 14-3-3, or that it associates with RAF-1 in a nonspecific manner, remains to be determined.

The ability of ionizing radiation to activate MEK5-ERK5 is unknown. Based on the fact that EGFR/RAS signaling can promote MEK5-ERK5 activation, and radiation also activates these molecules, it seems likely that this pathway will be stimulated following exposure of cells to ionizing radiation. One report has shown in drug-resistant MCF-7 cells that MEK5 is overexpressed and plays a protective role against chemotherapeutic agents and death receptor activation (Weldon *et al.*, 2002). Thus, it is possible that inhibition of MEK5-ERK5 signaling may promote radiation-induced death.

### Phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) pathway and MAPK pathway interactions with ionizing radiation

PI3K enzymes consist of two subunits, a catalytic P110 subunit and a regulatory and localizing subunit, P85. Several different classes of PI3K enzymes exist (Wyman and Pirola, 1998; Vanhaesebroeck and Alessi, 2000). The P85 subunit of PI3K enzymes contains a phosphotyrosine (SH2)-binding domain (Ching *et al.*, 2001). The major catalytic function of the PI3K is in the P110 subunit that acts to phosphorylate inositol phospholipids (PIP2: phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bis-phosphate), in the plasma membrane at the 3 position within the inositol sugar ring. Mitogens such as TGF-α and heregulin stimulate tyrosine phosphorylation of

ERBB family receptors, providing acceptor sites for the SH2 domain of p85 (Lee *et al.*, 2001a; Yu *et al.*, 2001). Binding of P85 to active ERBB receptors (predominantly ERBB3) results in P110PI3K activation. Other studies have suggested in cells expressing mutant oncogenic H-RAS or which are stimulated by mitogens that utilize serpentine receptors that the P110 subunit of PI3K can directly bind to RAS-GTP, leading to catalytic activation of the kinase (Rubio *et al.*, 1997; Van-Weering *et al.*, 1998; Gu *et al.*, 2000) (Figure 1).

The molecule inositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate is an acceptor site in the plasma membrane for molecules that contain a pleckstrin-binding domain (PH domain), in particular, the protein kinases PDK1 and AKT (also called protein kinase B, PKB) (Filippa *et al.*, 2000). PDK1 is proposed to phosphorylate and activate AKT, as is SRC (Chen *et al.*, 2001b). Signaling by PDK1 to AKT and by PDK1 and AKT downstream to other protein kinases, such as PKC isoforms, GSK3, mTOR, P70<sup>S6K</sup> and P90<sup>RSK</sup>, has been shown to play a key role in mitogenic and metabolic responses of cells as well as protection of cells from noxious stresses (Cross *et al.*, 1995; Alessi *et al.*, 1996; Balendran *et al.*, 2000; Dickson *et al.*, 2001; Podsypanina *et al.*, 2001).

The antiapoptotic role of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been well documented by many investigators in response to numerous noxious stimuli, and in some cell types, the antiapoptotic effects of ERBB receptor signaling have been attributed to activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway (Daly *et al.*, 1999; Kainulainen *et al.*, 2000). ERBB signaling to PI3K/AKT has been proposed to enhance the expression of the mitochondrial antiapoptosis proteins BCL-XL and MCL-1 and caspase inhibitor proteins such as c-FLIP isoforms (Leverrier *et al.*, 1999; Kuo *et al.*, 2001; Panka *et al.*, 2001). Enhanced expression of BCL-XL and MCL-1 will protect cells from apoptosis via the intrinsic/mitochondrial pathway, whereas expression of c-FLIP isoforms will block killing from the extrinsic pathway via death receptors (Suhara *et al.*, 2001). In addition, AKT has been shown to phosphorylate BAD and human procaspase 9, thereby rendering these proteins inactive in apoptotic processes (Fujita *et al.*, 1999; Li *et al.*, 2001). Inhibitors of ERBB signaling have been shown to decrease the activity of the PI3K/AKT pathway in a variety of cell types and to increase the sensitivity of cells to a wide range of toxic stresses including cytotoxic drugs and radiation (Pianetti *et al.*, 2001). Activation of AKT was shown to protect cells from death in the presence of ERBB receptor inhibition (Cuello *et al.*, 2001). These findings strongly argue that PI3K/AKT signaling is a key cytoprotective response in many cell types downstream of ERBB family receptors.

Data from several groups have argued that a key radioprotective pathway downstream of plasma membrane receptors is the PI3K pathway. Inhibition of P110 PI3K function by use of the inhibitors LY 294002 and wortmannin radiosensitizes tumor cells expressing mutant RAS molecules or wild-type RAS molecules that are constitutively active (Gupta *et al.*, 2000; Gupta *et al.*, 2001; Grana *et al.*, 2002). It is possible that these inhibitors may exert a portion of their radiosensitizing properties by inhibiting proteins with PI3K-like kinase domains such as ATM, ATR and DNA-PK. Expression of a constitutively active P110 PI3K molecule was able to recapitulate partially the expression of mutant H-RAS in protecting cells from radiation toxicity in these studies. In the same studies that PI3K P110 inhibitors were shown to radiosensitize cells, ‘P38 inhibitors,’ for example, SB203580, used at concentrations, which also have been shown to blunt PDK1 and AKT activity (Lali *et al.*, 2000; Rane *et al.*, 2001; Zhang *et al.*, 2001), did not radiosensitize cells. Recent data have also suggested that antisense PDK1 oligonucleotides also do not radiosensitize cells (Nakamura *et al.*, 2002). Thus, LY294002 and wortmannin may sensitize tumor cells to radiation through PI3K-dependent PDK1-independent pathway(s). Of note, in these cell lines and culture conditions, inhibition of the ERK pathway did not appear to alter the radiosensitivity of cells.

The cytotoxic effects of drugs, as well as radiation, can be magnified by the inhibition of ERBB receptors, paralleled by a reduced ability of cells to activate the ERK and PI3K pathways (e.g., Munster *et al.*, 2002). For example, expression of dominant-negative EGFR-CD533 enhanced apoptosis and radiosensitized MDA-MB-231 mammary carcinoma cells that were dependent upon, at least in part, inhibition of radiation-induced ERK signaling; neither basal activity nor activation of PI3K/AKT was blocked under these conditions (Contessa *et al.*, 2002). Expression of this dominant-negative ERBB1 molecule could also radiosensitize glioblastoma cells that correlated with both reduced basal ERK activity and radiation-induced ERK activation (Lammering *et al.*, 2001a,b,c).

In many cell types, ERK signaling does not appear to play a role in controlling radiosensitivity. In those cells where effects have been observed, the abilities of MEK1/2 inhibitors to enhance cell killing by radiation were originally linked to a derangement of radiation-induced G2/M growth arrest and enhanced apoptosis (Abbott and Holt, 1999; Park *et al.*, 1999). However, activation of the ERK pathway following irradiation has been found to promote radiosensitivity in some cell types by abrogating the G2/M checkpoint (Warenius *et al.*, 1996; Lee *et al.*, 2002b). Indeed, data from the study by Abbott and Holt demonstrated that a constitutively active MEK1 radiosensitized their cells, whereas dominant-negative MEK2 or dominant-negative MEK1 (S217A) caused radiosensitization. In agreement with this concept and of particular note, we have recently shown that the G2/M checkpoint abrogator UCN-01 potently activates the ERK pathway (McKinstry *et al.*, 2002). MEK1/2 inhibitors synergize with UCN-01 to promote cell death, but radiation does not further enhance the apoptotic response of these cells, indicating that MEK1/2 inhibitors require an intact G2/M checkpoint to enhance radiation-induced apoptosis. The dual positive and negative nature of ERK signaling in the control of cell survival has also been observed for

other DNA-damaging agents such as adriamycin and UV radiation (Kitagawa *et al.*, 2002; Pardo *et al.*, 2002; Tang *et al.*, 2002).

An excellent example of this dual nature of ERK signaling is also displayed by DU145 human prostate cancer cells. These cells secrete the EGFR ligand TGF-α, which confers autocrine growth through ERK signaling. Ionizing radiation markedly increases the release of TGF-α, providing a growth stimulus which is at odds with cellular repair mechanisms. If EGFR–ERK signaling is transiently blocked either by the tyrphostin AG1478 or a MEK1/2 inhibitor prior to irradiation, then DU145 cell growth is retarded and radiation-induced cell killing is decreased. Moreover, if the EGFR is strongly activated by EGF or TGF-α immediately after irradiation, then cell killing is increased, as would be expected, that is, transient inhibition of radiation-induced ERK signaling or suprastimulation of ERK at the time of irradiation radiosensitizes tumor cells. Removal of MEK1/2 inhibitor from the growth media 24 and 48 h after irradiation results in a null effect on DU145 cell radiosensitivity. Similar data were also obtained in A431 squamous carcinoma cells (Grant *et al.*, 2002; Qiao *et al.*, 2002). On the other hand, we have also reported that following irradiation, prolonged inhibition of ERK (≥72 h) can significantly increase the apoptotic response of DU145 and A431 cells and reduce clonogenic survival (Hagan *et al.*, 2000; Yacoub *et al.*, 2001, 2003). Therefore, the interruption of ERK signaling can either enhance or degrade carcinoma cell survival depending on its timing and duration.

### Other mechanisms by which ERK signaling may alter cell survival

In some cell types, signaling from ERBB receptors through the ERK pathway can lead to increased expression of BCL-XL, MCL-1 and c-FLIP isoforms (Boucher *et al.*, 2000; Aoudjit and Vuori, 2001; Jost *et al.*, 2001; Qiao *et al.*, 2001; Lee and McCubrey, 2002). MAPK signaling can block apoptosis at levels above the mitochondrion/cytochrome c, whereas in others it blunts the actions of caspases downstream of cytochrome c release (e.g., Erhardt *et al.*, 1999; Qiao *et al.*, 2001; Shonai *et al.*, 2002). In particular, the proapoptotic protein BAD is phosphorylated and inactivated by both ERK1/2 signaling (Serine 112) and PI3K/AKT (Serine 136) (Scheid *et al.*, 1999; Hayakawa *et al.*, 2000; von Gise *et al.*, 2001; Mabuchi *et al.*, 2002). Thus, ERK1/2 and AKT signaling can cooperate to reduce the apoptotic threshold in cells. In addition, it is also possible that ERK1/2 and AKT, via the P70 S6 kinase, may cooperate to inhibit BAD function (Harada *et al.*, 2001). Recently, ionizing radiation has been shown to activate the P70 S6 kinase in an EGFR-, PI3K- and MEK1/2-dependent fashion (Carter *et al.*, 1998; Con tessa *et al.*, 2002). Thus, radiation-induced P70 S6 kinase signaling may alter the apoptotic response of irradiated cells via the modulation of BAD phosphorylation.

Radiation-induced ERK activation has been linked to increased expression of the DNA repair proteins ERCC1, XRCC1 and XPC (Yacoub *et al.*, 2001, 2003). Transcriptional regulation of these genes appears to be via AP-1 and SP-1 sites. Inhibition of radiation-induced repair protein expression by an MEK1/2 inhibitor in DU145 cells correlated with decreased DNA repair, increased micronucleus formation and reduced clonogenic survival. Inhibition of EGFR/ERK signaling also blocked repair of sublethal DNA damage (Yacoub *et al.*, 2003). Thus, on the one hand, some data indicate that the early activation of ERK following irradiation enhances cell killing, whereas on the other, the early activation of ERK is responsible for increased DNA repair, which should enhance cell survival.

In addition, the downstream effector of the ERK1/2 enzymes, P90<sup>RSK</sup>, phosphorylates the transcription factors CREB and CCAAT enhancer binding protein (C/EBP)β, which can activate the promoters of several antiapoptotic proteins (e.g., De Cesare *et al.*, 1998; Riccio *et al.*, 1999). Recent studies have shown that radiation, via the ERK pathway, can enhance the DNA binding of CREB and C/EBPβ, and it is likely that signaling via these transcription factors plays a role in proliferative and survival responses after tumor cells are irradiated (Amorino *et al.*, 2002).

In contrast to potential radioprotective transcription factors downstream of ERK, EGR-1 is an ERK-dependent transcription factor that has been linked to enhanced cell killing following radiation exposure (Ahmed *et al.*, 1997; Das *et al.*, 2001; Virolle *et al.*, 2001). Of note, however, are other studies that argue that EGR-1 can act to protect irradiated cells (Hallahan *et al.*, 1995; Huang *et al.*, 1998; De Belle *et al.*, 1999; Meyer *et al.*, 2002). Overexpression of EGR-1 correlated with treatment failure in prostate cancer (Ahmed *et al.*, 2001). The radiosensitizing effects of EGR-1 have been linked to increased TNF-α and PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homologue on chromosome 10) expression, whereas the radioprotective effects of EGR-1 have been linked to TGF-β and enhanced growth arrest in the late Gl phase of the cell cycle. Thus collectively, ERK signaling may act to promote survival via some transcription factors (CREB, C/EBPβ) and may act to either promote survival or death through others (EGR-1, AP-1).

The transcription nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), shown to be downstream of ERBB and TNF-α receptors, has been proposed to act in radioprotection (Jung and Dritschilo, 2001). However, other studies have argued against NF-κB as a direct radioprotective factor (Russell *et al.*, 2002). Several manuscripts have suggested that NFκB signaling is regulated by the PI3K pathway (Sizemore *et al.*, 2002), whereas others have suggested that ERK signaling can regulate this transcription factor through autocrine mechanisms, for example, enhanced TNF-α expression (Troppmair *et al.*, 1998; Tuyt *et al.*, 1999; Chen and Lin, 2001; Bhat-Nakshatri *et al.*, 2002). Radiation-induced IKK activation has been argued to be PI3K-independent (Shao *et al.*, 2001). ERK signaling has the potential to

inhibit expression of the protein PAR4, which is downstream of mutant RAS molecules (Barradas *et al.*, 1999; Qiu *et al.*, 1999). PAR4 is a protein inhibitor of PKCζ and NF-κB function (Diaz-Meco *et al.*, 1999; Wang *et al.*, 1999; Camandola and Mattson, 2000; Chakraborty *et al.*, 2001; Chendil *et al.*, 2002). More recently, PAR4 has been shown to radiosensitize prostate tumor cells (Chendil *et al.*, 2002). This may, in part, be due to enhanced signaling from death receptors (Chakraborty *et al.*, 2001). Thus, PAR4 may be a link between ERK signaling, NF-κB function and radiosensitivity. Hence, in a cell-type-dependent manner, PI3K, NF-κB or ERK signaling, downstream of receptors and RAS molecules, or a combination of these signals, may play a radioprotective role.

### Conclusions

In conclusion, MAPK pathways can control cell fate after irradiation. ERK signaling may either protect or enhance radiation sensitivity depending upon the cell type and for how long the ERK pathway is inhibited. The P38 pathway plays an important role in the control of radiation-induced G2/M arrest, which is protective, and, in certain cell types, may also play a proapoptotic role via the induction of GADD transcription factors. Activation of the JNK pathway was initially linked to toxic effects of radiation signaling. However, recent studies have also linked JNK signaling to increased expression of DNA repair genes and to protective effects downstream of death receptors. The MEK5–ERK5 pathway is more poorly described, but appears to be activated by growth factors in a manner similar to the MEK1/2–ERK1/2 pathway. Thus, it is probable that MEK5–ERK5 can either protect or enhance radiation toxicity in a cell-type-specific manner.
