**ABSTRACT**

Apelin, an endogenous ligand of the G-protein-coupled receptor APJ, is expressed in a diverse number of organs. The apelin–APJ axis helps to control the processes of pathological and physiological fibrosis, including renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, liver fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. However, the role of apelin–APJ in organ fibrosis remains controversial due to conflicting study results. The apelin–APJ axis is a detrimental mechanism which promotes liver fibrosis mainly via up-regulation the expression of collagen-II and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ). On the contrary, the apelin–APJ axis is beneficial for renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis. The apelin–APJ axis alleviates renal fibrosis by restraining the expression of transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1). In addition, the apelin–APJ axis attenuates cardiac fibrosis through multiple pathways. Furthermore, the apelin–APJ axis has beneficial effects on experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) which suggest the apelin–APJ axis potentially alleviates pulmonary fibrosis. In this article, we review the controversies associated with apelin–APJ in organ fibrosis and introduce the drugs that target apelin–APJ. We conclude that future studies should place more emphasis on the relationship among apelin isoforms, APJ receptor subtypes and organ fibrosis. The apelin–APJ axis will be a potential therapeutic target and those drugs targeted for apelin–APJ may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy for renal fibrosis, cardiac fibrosis, liver fibrosis and pulmonary fibrosis.

# 1. Introduction

Apelin is an endogenous ligand of the G protein-coupled receptor APJ, which was originally isolated from bovine stomach extracts [1]. The APJ receptor was initially identified as the gene with the closest homology to the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT-1). Apelin and APJ are highly expressed in the central nervous system and peripheral tissues, which play important roles in the cardiovascular system, including the reduction of blood pressure, the regulation of cardiovascular tone [2] and the increase of cardiac contractility [3]. The apelin–APJ axis is also involved in the process of glucose metabolism [4], gastrointestinal track physiology [5] and water homeostasis [3, 6]. Our laboratory showed that apelin-13 stimulates vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) proliferation, promotes monocyte adhesion to human umbilical vein endothelial cells, increases angiogenesis and improves cardiac repair post-myocardial infarction [7–10]. In recent years, extensive research efforts and studies have focused on the role of the apelin–APJ axis in pathological fibrosis.

Most body organs contain parenchyma and mesenchymal cells. The decrease of parenchyma cells and the activation of fibroblasts usually result in the development of organ fibrosis. The main characteristics of organ fibrosis include the production of inflammatory factors, the secretion of extracellular matrix, and the activation and proliferation of fibroblasts [11]. Organ fibrosis mainly occurs in renal, heart, liver and lung tissue. Sustained fibrosis leads to structural damage, decline of organ function, and organ failure, which eventually constitute a threat to human life [12].

Recent studies indicated that the apelin–APJ axis is associated with renal fibrosis, myocardial fibrosis, liver fibrosis and lung fibrosis. However, the functions of apelin–APJ in the development of fibrosis are conflicting. Many factors participate in the organ fibrosis process, such as transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1), angiotensin II (Ang-II) and extracellular matrix (ECM). Those factors contribute to the development of fibrosis by promoting cell proliferation, differentiation, wound repair and extracellular matrix production [13,14]. Some articles suggest that apelin–APJ inhibits renal and myocardial fibrosis via the TGF-β pathway. On the contrary, the apelin–APJ axis promotes liver fibrosis. Should the apelin–APJ axis be regarded as a protective mechanism or as a harmful process contributing to the progression of organ fibrosis? Here, we review almost all recent studies and attempt to describe the mechanism of apelin–APJ in the fibrosis of different organs. We also propose some potential drugs that target apelin–APJ which may be used for clinical therapy in the future.

In addition, there are some methods that can specifically quantify apelin in human biological fluids, including enzyme immunoassay (EIA), radioimmunoassay (RIA), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Apelin has great clinical relevance, so we strongly recommend that apelin will be a biomarker and correlated biochemical indexes of fibrosis diseases.

## 2. The apelin–APJ axis attenuates renal fibrosis

The endless healing process results in renal fibrosis when the normal wound healing response fails. Renal fibrosis is a major hallmark in the occurrence and progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) [15, 16]. The apelin–APJ axis activates the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) pathway [17]. Mice were subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) surgery and then treated with Losartan. Losartan elevates the level of apelin, p-Akt and eNOS. Furthermore, losartan alleviates UUO-induced renal fibrosis via the apelin/APJ/Akt/eNOS pathway. The apelin–APJ axis has a synergistic effect in attenuating renal fibrosis with the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blockade of losartan [18].

In mammals, TGF-β, which has three structurally similar isoforms, including TGF-β 1, 2 and 3, is associated with tissue fibrosis [19–21]. TGF-β signalling includes Smad protein-dependent and Smad protein-independent pathways [22]. TGF-β triggers the epithelial–mesenchymal transition, which also contributes to the development of renal fibrosis [23,24]. In vitro, apelin inhibits the TGF-β-induced epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) in HK-2 cells. In the UUO model, apelin treatment significantly reduces the expression of TGF-β1 and its receptor, as well as interstitial matrix components. Apelin is able to ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis by suppressing tubular EMT through a Smad protein-dependent mechanism [25] (Fig. 1). These findings prove that apelin–APJ has potential renoprotective effects and is an effective agent for retarding CKD progression.

Renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis may be the final common pathway for most kidney diseases, regardless of aetiology [26]. It is the pathological lesion associated with renal function in humans [27,28]. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a major contributor to the mortality among allograft recipients. Malyszko et al. assessed the association between apelin and CAD among kidney allograft recipients and haemodialysis patients. Apelin was significantly lower, but inflammation was significantly elevated among patients with CAD [29,30]. Apelin can be used to predict the outcomes of renal disease patients with CAD. Codognotto et al. investigated the relationship between apelin and CAD in haemodialyzed patients. The apelin level was significantly lower in dialyzed patients with CAD. These results indicate that apelin may be an inotropic agent for patients with uraemic cardiomyopathy [31] (Table 1).

El-Shehaby et al. [32] found that apelin is negatively correlated with inflammatory markers and positively correlated with cardiac function in haemodialysis patients. Furthermore, plasma apelin (apelin-12, -13 and -36) levels are decreased in haemodialyzed patients. Therefore, they concluded that apelin may adaptively regulate cardiovascular function in end-stage renal disease patients (Table 1).

Fig. 1. The apelin–APJ axis attenuates renal fibrosis. Renal interstitial fibrosis is mainly induced by the tubular epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). EMT primarily acts through a smad protein-dependent mechanism in renal tissue. The smad protein-dependent pathway mainly includes three steps. First, the level of activated R-smads (smad1, 2, 3, 5, and 8) is markedly increased when transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β1) binds to TβR-I. Second, the activated R-Smads bind to Co-smad to form a smad protein. Finally, the smad protein binds to target genes to regulate the synthesis of proteins in the nucleus. Apelin is able to ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis by suppressing the activation of TGF-β.

TGF-$\beta$ is the key mediator stimulating extracellular matrix (ECM) production. Furthermore, TGF-$\beta$ plays its biological function through smad signaling pathway, protein kinase C (PKC) pathway and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway which determine chronic renal inflammation and renal fibrosis [33,34]. Fibrosis is the end stage of kidney injury. Treatment with apelin-13 significantly reverses renal injury in male rats with renal ischemia/reperfusion injury. Consistently, apelin-13 inhibits the upregulation of TGF-$\beta$1 in vitro. These data elucidate that apelin-13 may exhibit renoprotection in renal disease [35] (Table 1).

### 3. The apelin–APJ axis reverses myocardial fibrosis

Apelin/APJ axis alleviates myocardial fibrosis. Ang-II induces cardiac fibrosis and vascular remodelling by activating plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) [36–38]. In vivo, apelin abolishes ang-II induced cardiovascular fibrosis by inhibiting PAI-1. In addition, apelin protects against cardiac fibrosis and vascular remodelling by increasing the production of NO [39]. Furthermore, apelin also can activate the phosphorylation of AMPK to inhibit the posttranslational mechanisms of sphingosine kinase 1 (SphK1) in mouse cardiac fibroblasts. These results suggest that apelin suppresses the expression of Sphk1, which is the key anti-fibrotic factor in cardiac fibroblasts [40] (Fig. 2). The TGF-$\beta$1 pathway, which contains various fibrogenic factors [41,42], leads myocardial fibre cells to muscle fibroblasts [43,44]. The overexpression of the TGF-$\beta$1 gene alone could lead to cardiac fibrosis in mice [45]. It has been recorded that the activation of TGF-$\beta$1 upregulates SphK1 in human fibroblasts [46]. TGF-$\beta$ stimulates the activation of cardiac fibroblasts through a SphK1-dependent mechanism. Dmitri et al. confirm that apelin suppresses TGF-$\beta$1-mediated cardiac fibroblasts via the inhibition of the Sphk1 transcription mechanism [40] (Fig. 2).

A large amount of data show that the apelin–APJ axis plays an important role in the cardiovascular system, including positive inotrope therapy [3], decreases in blood pressure [36], and the regulation of angiogenesis [37]. Mice were infarcted by coronary artery ligation, resulting in cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis. Treatment with apelin-13 reduces the degree of cardiac hypertrophy and cardiac fibrosis in post-myocardial infarction (post-MI) mice compared to sham controls [10]. Apelin recruits bone marrow cells (BMCs). The overexpression of apelin in BMCs accelerates cardiac repair and alleviates cardiac fibrosis in post-MI mice [9]. Heart failure is usually accompanied by cardiac fibrosis. In clinical research on heart failure patients, the level of

Fig. 2. The apelin-APJ axis reverses myocardial fibrosis. The deposition of fibrin, vascular remodeling and the activation of myofibroblasts are the main factors that lead to cardiac fibrosis. Apelin suppresses the activation of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and increases the production of NO to inhibit the deposition of fibrin and vascular remodeling. In the TGF-β-stimulated mouse cardiac fibroblasts, apelin regulated the accumulation of extracellular matrix (ECM) and α-SMA by inhibiting sphingosine kinase1 (Sphk1). Sphk1 plays an important role in the progression of TGF-β, which leads to the accumulation of collagen and α-SMA with S1P2 and the activation of the tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1 (TIMP-1). Furthermore, apelin also can activate the phosphorylation of AMPK to inhibit the posttranslational mechanism of SphK1 in unstimulated mouse cardiac fibroblasts.

apelin is increased in early-stage disease, but gradually lowers with the development of disease. The apelin-APJ system might play a compensatory role in early-stage disease [47] (Table 1). Here, we hypothesize that apelin-APJ may alleviate heart failure-related cardiac fibrosis.

Atherosclerosis of the coronary artery induces the sustainability of cardiac fibroblasts. In ApoE-KO mice, exogenous Ang II promotes atherosclerosis, but infusion of apelin could curb Ang-II-induced atherosclerosis by activating the NO signaling pathway. Similarly, apelin treatment rescues Ang II-mediated vascular remodeling in a vein graft model [48] (Table 1).

### 4. The apelin-APJ axis promotes liver fibrosis

The liver contains parenchymal cells (hepatocytes and cholangiocytes) and non-parenchymal cells (endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, biliary cells, hepatic stellate cells). Hepatic stellate cells are non-parenchymal cells that can transdifferentiate into collagen-producing myofibroblasts and produce extracellular matrix [49]. Upon activation, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) change their morphology and increase the expression of mesenchymal markers, such as α-SMA, collagen type I, and fibronectin [50]. HSCs are a major contributor to liver fibrosis [51–53].

Angiotensin II (AngII) and endothelin-1 (ET-1) enhanced apelin expression in a human HSC line (LX-2). Increased apelin further promotes the synthesis of collagen-I and platelet-derived growth factor receptor β (PDGFRβ), which are closely associated with liver fibrosis. The administration of apelin receptor blocker counteracts AngII, and ET-1 induces the expression of collagen-I and PDGFRβ. These data indicate that apelin-APJ could be an important mediator of liver fibrogenesis [54] (Fig. 3).

Chronic liver diseases caused by infection, drugs, or immune attack and hepatic acute injury contribute to liver fibrosis [55]. As a result, sustained liver fibrosis will accelerate the development of liver cirrhosis and hepatic failure, which seriously affect patients' health and quality of life [55,56]. Apelin triggers the steps of proinflammatory and neoangiogenic signaling pathways mainly through the proangiogenic factors VEGF, PDGF and angiopoietin 2 which suggest that apelin and APJ may be involved in the processes of inflammation, neoangiogenesis, fibrogenesis and liver cirrhosis [57]. The levels of apelin and APJ are markedly increased in the cirrhotic liver. In vitro, PDGF and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the expression of APJ in HSCs. High levels of APJ might contribute to the proinflammatory cytokine-stimulated proliferation of HSCs in fibrogenesis. These results suggest that APJ plays a role in vascular remodeling in cirrhosis and fibrogenesis [58]. Both the unbalanced extracellular matrix (ECM) and PDGFRβ are the major activators for human hepatic stellate cells (HSC) which contribute to liver fibrosis. While the effects of unbalanced ECM and PDGFRβ are totally abrogated when the activated HSCs revert to a quiescent state [59]. Furthermore, apelin promotes the expression of PDGFRβ in liver [58]. These reports hint that the apelin-APJ expression may change during the resolution of the fibrosis.

Studies were performed in rats with hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl₄ inhalation. The administration of the APJ antagonist F13A prevents the production of hepatic collagen, PDGFRβ, α-smooth muscle actin, matrix metalloproteinases and tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase in hepatic fibrotic rats. The apelin-APJ axis is effective in enhancing hepatic fibrosis. A selective APJ receptor antagonist might be useful in preventing the progression of fibrosis in liver diseases [60] (Table 1).

Apelin is associated with liver fibrogenesis [61]. Kalafateli et al. [62] investigated the adipokine levels in alcoholic liver cirrhosis (ALC) and
found that the concentration of apelin diminished along with worsening liver disease. In addition, the apelin level was negatively correlated with the fat mass, which is the result of the biosynthetic ability of liver degradation in non-diabetic ALC patients. These findings indicated that apelin is related to deteriorating hepatic physiological function in patients with ALC (Table 1).

Clinicopathologic research has found that chronic hepatitis C eventually leads to fibrosis-carcinoma. In liver tissues of hepatitis C virus (HCV) patients, the expression of apelin in the HSCs, portal fibroblasts and endothelial cells is significantly elevated. These results illustrate that apelin participates in HCV and links to the process of fibrogenesis [63] (Table 1).

Recent studies indicate that the expression of apelin is upregulated in HSCs of cirrhotic rats. Clinical research data shows that circulating levels of apelin in cirrhosis patients are also increased. In cirrhotic rats, hepatic stellate cells produce a large amount of apelin, and the expression of apelin and APJ is markedly increased in liver tissue. Treatment with the APJ blocker F13A leads to the alleviation of hepatic fibrosis. Apelin and APJ may possibly become novel therapeutic targets in liver fibrosis and cirrhosis [64] (Table 1).

Biliary atresia (BA) is characterized by the complete obliteration of the extrahepatic bile duct accompanied by liver fibrosis. The hepatic apelin–APJ axis is markedly activated in the progression of BA, especially in end-stage cirrhosis. The activation of the apelin–APJ axis might reflect the severity of hepatic fibrosis [65] (Table 1).

### 5. The apelin–APJ axis potentially alleviates pulmonary fibrosis

Pulmonary fibrosis is defined by the diverse methods of fibrin deposition and inflammation as a result of decreases in the pulmonary parenchyma. In the rat lung, apelin is expressed in endothelial cells of small blood vessels [66], whereas APJ is ubiquitously distributed in bronchial epithelial cells and in small pulmonary blood vessels in the endothelium, smooth muscle cells [67] and macrophages [68]. In addition, apelin–APJ plays a role in neonatal lung development after birth [69,70]. APJ expression decreases in experimental chronic lung disease. The inhibition of the apelin–APJ axis may impede alveolar and vascular development and decrease pulmonary hypertension [2,71,72].

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a chronic lung disease that usually occurs in premature infants treated with oxygen and positive pressure ventilation [73]. Neonatal rats were exposed to 100% oxygen

to establish the BPD model and were then treated with apelin. The administration of apelin reduces pulmonary fibrin deposition and inflammation in experimental BPD rats. These data indicate that apelin–APJ has a beneficial effect on experimental BPD [74] (Fig. 4).

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a type of acute lung injury. A rat model of ARDS was induced by oleic acid (OA). ARDS rats treated with the APJ receptor antagonist F13A showed decreased OA-induced histopathological changes. However, apelin-13 attenuates OA-induced inflammation and lung injury. These data show that the apelin–APJ axis has an effect on anti-injury and organ protection during ARDS [75–77] (Fig. 4).

Pulmonary hypertension (PH) is associated with pulmonary fibrosis [78]. The concentration of apelin is significantly reduced in serum of patients with PH. In a PH animal model induced by chronic hypoxia and apelin deficiency, mice present more severe PH compared with the control group. Furthermore, in vitro knockdown of apelin in human pulmonary artery endothelial cells results in downregulated eNOS and Kruppel-like factor 2 (KLF2) expressions. These data reveal that the apelin–APJ axis has a potential role in alleviating PH [79,80] (Table 1). The levels of apelin also decreased in pulmonary arterial endothelial cells of patients with PH [81].

In the rat model of monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertension, the expression of apelin was increased and APJ protein was significantly lower, which suggested that the endogenous dysfunction of apelin–APJ might have an important effect on the development of pulmonary hypertension induced by monocrotaline [82] (Table 1). All of the above findings suggest that apelin is involved in pulmonary hypertension. While pulmonary hypertension is associated with pulmonary fibrosis, a decrease in vascular capacitance is especially important [78]. The effect of apelin in lung fibrosis requires further elucidation.

### 6. Drugs that target the apelin–APJ axis

Various fragments of apelin target the APJ. The natural peptide agonists of APJ include apelin-13 [83], Pry-apelin-13 [83], apelin-13 Q1A [84], apelin-13 H7A [84], apelin-13 P12A [84], apelin-12 C1 [85], apelin-12 C3 [85] and apelin-12 C4 [85]. The natural antagonist isoforms of APJ include apelin-13 F13A [86], apelin-13 (13[D-Phe]) [86], apelin-13 (F13[D-Ala]) [86], apelin-13 C1 [87], apelin-13 C2 [87], apelin-13 C3 [87], apelin-13 C4 [87] and apelin-13 C5 [87] (Table 2).

Messari et al. detected the activities of different apelin fragments, including G5F, R10F, P11F, pE13F, K14P, K15M, K16P and K17F. K17F binds to APJ with the highest affinity. K17F, K15M, K14P and pE13F all have hypotensive functions and K17F has a maximal hypotensive response [88]. The apelin-13 and apelin-36 isoforms all exert cardiac protection [89]. In addition, mutant apelin-13(F13A) exhibits similar binding affinity but has a function opposite that of natural apelin-13 [90].

In addition to apelin ligands, several small molecule compounds target the APJ receptor. MM07, which has greater effects on vasodilator and cardiac output compared with apelin-13, was identified as a selective agonist of APJ [91]. E339-3D6, which displays high affinity, is a non-peptidic APJ agonist. [92]. The small molecule ML233 is an agonist of APJ, which could be an antihypertensive drug that targets APJ [93] (Table 2).

The results with APJ receptor binding and function assays demonstrated that as an antagonist, ALX40-4C directly bound to APJ and prevented ligand-induced intracellular Ca²⁺ mobilization and receptor internalization [94]. Another inhibitor 4-oxo-6-((pyrimidin-2-ylthio)methyl)-4H-pyran-3-yl4-nitrobenzoate (ML221) blocked the APJ receptor by inhibiting the production of cAMP and the recruitment of β-arrestin, is a biased antagonist of APJ [95] (Table 2).

These results revealed that puerarin [96] regulates blood pressure and protects target organs via the apelin–APJ pathway, at least in part.

As discussed above, numerous compounds can be APJ antagonists or agonists. However, whether these compounds can be used to treat

**Fig. 4.** The apelin–APJ axis potentially alleviates pulmonary fibrosis. Pulmonary fibrin deposition, inflammation and lung injury all have close relationships with pulmonary fibrosis. The administration of apelin reduces pulmonary fibrin deposition and inflammation in rats with experimental bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). In addition, apelin-13 attenuates inflammation and lung injury in rats with ARDS induced by OA. Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) rats treated with the APJ receptor antagonist F13A showed decreased OA-induced lung injury.

fibrotic diseases requires further investigation. With the optimization of structure, novel antifibrosis drugs for APJ will be found in future research.

### 6.1. Perspectives

All of the above results suggest that the apelin-APJ axis, which plays a conflicting role in organ fibrosis, reduces the severity of cardiac fibrosis and renal fibrosis but aggravates the development of liver fibrosis. The mechanism by which the apelin-APJ axis produces contradictory outcomes in various organs is still obscure.

Firstly, apelin possesses several isoforms [88], such as K17F, K15M, K14P and pE13F. Different isoforms possess their own characteristics and may have unique functions in various organs. All the apelin isoforms can be found in plasma and all of the tissues. Apelin-13, apelin-17 and (Pyr1) apelin-13 are the predominant isoforms in plasma, while apelin-36 is the major isoform in the colostrum [97]. Apelin-13 is the major isoform. Many studies have also investigated the cardiac function of apelin-36 [89] and the physiologic and pathologic roles of K17F, which has the highest affinity to the receptor [88]. However, studies on the function of other apelin isoforms in organ fibrosis are still lacking.

Secondly, the role of the APJ receptor in organ fibrosis is rather complicated. APJ is a double-edged sword in that the APJ receptor may have several subtypes, which are distributed in various organs [98]. However, research on APJ receptor subtypes is still limited.

Thirdly, most of the studies on the apelin-APJ axis in organ fibrosis are focused on the later stage of the disease. Clinical studies found that the level of apelin fluctuates during the process of fibrotic diseases [47]. This phenomenon suggests that the apelin-APJ axis may exert diverse functions as organ fibrosis progresses. Future studies should place more emphasis on the relationship between apelin-APJ and the different stages of fibrotic diseases.

Finally, the pathology of fibrosis is intricate. Various stimuli induce the occurrence of organ fibrosis by activating diverse signalling pathways. Apelin-APJ may have a protective or damaging role when faced with different stimuli. Therefore, the apelin-APJ axis may play a distinct role in various types of stimuli-induced fibrosis.

### 7. Conclusion

In this review, we discussed the relationship between the apelin-APJ axis and organ fibrosis, which will be conducive to the development of effective therapy for organ fibrosis. Therefore, depending on whether the apelin-APJ axis plays protective or harmful roles in organ fibrosis, this axis may be a therapeutic target in organ fibrosis. Currently, most
