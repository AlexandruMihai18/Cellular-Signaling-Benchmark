## Summary

Protein homology studies identified five kinases potentially capable of phosphorylating the Spo0F response regulator and initiating sporulation in *Bacillus subtilis*. Two of these kinases, KinA and KinB, were known from previous studies to be responsible for sporulation in laboratory media. *In vivo* studies of the activity of four of the kinases, KinA, KinC, KinD (ykvD) and KinE (ykrQ), using *abrB* transcription as an indicator of Spo0A~P level, revealed that KinC and KinD were responsible for Spo0A~P production during the exponential phase of growth in the absence of KinA and KinB. *In vitro*, all four kinases dephosphorylated Spo0F~P with the production of ATP at approximately the same rate, indicating that they possess approximately equal affinity for Spo0F. All the kinases were expressed during growth and early stationary phase, suggesting that the differential activity observed in growth and sporulation results from differential activation by signal ligands unique to each kinase.

## Introduction

The initiation of sporulation in *Bacillus subtilis* is regulated by a phosphorylation-mediated signal transduction pathway termed the phosphorelay (Fig. 1) (Burbulys *et al.*, 1991). The sporulation transcription factor, Spo0A, is activated by phosphorylation via the phosphorelay to induce or repress a number of genes. Phosphate input in this pathway depends upon kinases whose activity is regulated by specific signals, the nature of which remain unknown. The most active kinase for sporulation in laboratory media is Kinase A, KinA (Antoniewski *et al.*, 1990). KinA phosphorylates the Spo0F response regulator whose phosphoryl group is transferred to Spo0A via the Spo0B phosphotransferase (Fig. 1). Mutants lacking KinA sporulate at 5% of the rate of wild-type strains, indicating that at least one other kinase must be active in the phosphorelay (Perego *et al.*, 1989). Sporulation is decreased to almost zero in KinA⁻ strains that are also mutant in a second kinase, KinB (Trach and Hoch, 1993). Thus, the enzymatic activity of KinA and KinB can account for all the sporulation normally observed in the laboratory.

The most sensitive *in vivo* indication for the level of phosphorylated Spo0A is the transcription of the *abrB* gene that is repressed by low levels of Spo0A~P (Perego *et al.*, 1988). In a KinA⁻KinB⁻ mutant, sufficient Spo0A~P is formed to regulate this gene normally, indicating that other kinases may phosphorylate Spo0A, but not to levels high enough to induce sporulation (Trach and Hoch, 1993). Several lines of evidence suggested the identity of these kinases. A kinase, KinC, was found to be responsible for phosphorylating single amino acid mutants of Spo0A that bypass the requirement for Spo0F and Spo0B in sporulation (Kobayashi *et al.*, 1995; LeDeaux and Grossman, 1995). This suggested that KinC might be active on the wild-type Spo0A protein as well. Indeed, a *kinA*, *kinB*, *kinC* mutant was partially defective in the regulation of *abrB* transcription (LeDeaux *et al.*, 1995). Recently, it was discovered that certain alanine-scanning mutants of Spo0F showing an enhanced sporulation phenotype sporulated at high levels in the absence of KinA and KinB (Jiang *et al.*, 1999). The responsible kinases were found to be KinC and a fourth kinase, KinD. Finally, in a survey of the histidine kinase and response regulator repertoire of *B. subtilis*, it was revealed that KinA, KinB, KinC, KinD (ykvD) and a fifth kinase, KinE (ykrQ), formed a group (class IIIB) of closely related kinases based on sequence homology in the area of the active histidine residue (Fabret *et al.*, 1999). As this region of the kinases is a major interaction surface with response regulators and forms the active site (Zapf *et al.*, 2000), the observed homology may indicate that all these kinases are potentially active on Spo0F or Spo0A.

In the experiments described here, the role of the five kinases of class IIIB in the phosphorylation of Spo0A was assessed *in vivo* and *in vitro*. The results show that KinC and KinD are largely responsible for the observed Spo0A~P production and *abrB* regulation in the absence of KinA and KinB. KinC and KinD activities may regulate the onset of stationary phase gene expression, whereas

**Results**

**Effect of kinase mutations on abrB expression**

Expression of the *abrB* gene is negatively regulated by Spo0A (Strauch et al., 1990), and its level of transcription is believed to reflect the cellular phosphorylation level of Spo0A. Cells in early exponential growth, in which phosphorylation of Spo0A is low, transcribe *abrB* and, as growth progresses, transcription falls as a result of kinase activity, leading to Spo0A~P accumulation. Deletion of the genes for the major sporulation kinases, KinA and KinB, decreased the sporulation frequency by at least six orders of magnitude but, surprisingly, the kinetics of *abrB* repression were unchanged from the wild-type pattern (Trach and Hoch, 1993). This suggested that Spo0A~P levels were unchanged in a *kinA kinB* strain and other kinases could contribute to the phosphorylation of Spo0A. In order to test whether these kinases were members of the class IIIB kinases identified as close homologues to KinA and KinB (Fabret et al., 1999), multiple null mutations of these kinases were combined and tested for their effects on an *abrB-lacZ* transcription fusion. All mutants were prepared in a *kinA* strain. A strain with mutations in *kinA*, *kinB* and *kinD* was only slightly affected in *abrB* transcription (Fig. 2). In *kinA*, *kinC* or *kinA*, *kinB*, *kinC* strains, a more pronounced effect on *abrB* transcription was observed (Fig. 2). Mutation of all four kinases was required to obtain the highest level of *abrB* expression or, in other terms, the lowest Spo0A~P level. Therefore, the phosphorylation level of Spo0A in growth conditions may be maintained at wild-type levels by the action of KinC and KinD alone. *abrB* transcription levels off in the quadruple mutant, which may, in part, be as a result of KinE effects, although this also occurs in a *spo0A* mutant and has been attributed to autoregulation by AbrB (Strauch et al., 1989).

As both KinC and KinD activity contributed to *abrB* transcription, it was important to determine whether KinC and KinD phosphorylated Spo0F or Spo0A directly. To test these possibilities, kinase mutants with *spo0F* deletions were constructed. A *kinA*, *kinB*, *kinD*, i.e. KinC⁺, mutant regulated *abrB* in the normal fashion, although not quite as effectively as in the wild-type strain, and the absence of Spo0F had only a minor effect (Fig. 3). Thus, KinC probably acts directly on Spo0A in this mutant (Fig. 3). However, a *kinA*, *kinB*, *kinC* mutant, i.e. KinD⁺, was affected by deletion of *spo0F*, but the *abrB-lacZ* expression was not as high as that found in a *spo0F spo0A* mutant. Thus, KinD appears to be active mainly on

substrate than with Spo0A (Fig. 4, lane 3 versus lane 1). KinC was found to be weakly active in phosphorylation of the ComA response regulator, and KinD also showed some activity on this response regulator. However, the reciprocal is not true: ComP was active on ComA, but inactive with either Spo0A or Spo0F *in vitro* (unpublished results). Neither kinase could phosphorylate DegU. In kinetic experiments, the rate of Spo0F phosphorylation by KinC was 10-fold higher than the rate of Spo0A phosphorylation (Fig. 5A). Previous results with the same proteins and Spo0F showed that both KinC and KinD were 70-fold less active than KinA on Spo0F (Jiang et al., 1999). A time course of the reactions of KinA and KinC with Spo0A and Spo0A sof-1 revealed that both KinA and KinC are more active in phosphorylating the sof-1 Spo0A than Spo0A (Fig. 5B). However, the autophosphorylation rate of both is greater than the phosphotransfer rate, which is in contrast to the phosphotransfer rate of KinC with Spo0F (Fig. 4, KinC, lane 3). Thus, the rate of Spo0A phosphorylation by KinC or KinD is at least several 100-fold less than the capacity of KinA to phosphorylate Spo0F and less than the autophosphorylation rate.

The last member of the class IIIB kinases with potential to contribute phosphate to the phosphorelay is KinE (*ykrQ*). This kinase makes little contribution to the growth phase Spo0A~P level that represses *abrB* transcription, as determined by β-galactosidase assays of the *abrB-lacZ* fusion construct in various kinase mutant strains (data not shown). The purified KinE was capable of phosphorylating Spo0F, albeit at about 1% of the rate observed for purified KinA; the same level of activity was observed for both KinC and KinD on Spo0F *in vitro* (Jiang et al., 1999).

Using the back reaction to infer specificity

The enzymatic data present a dilemma: why are KinC and

KinC and KinD response regulator specificity in vitro

In order to test *in vitro* the response regulator specificity of KinC and KinD, maltose-binding protein fusions were produced that deleted the membrane-spanning regions of both proteins (Jiang et al., 1999). These soluble kinases were expressed in and purified from *Escherichia coli*. The ability of several response regulators to act as substrates was tested using [γ-³²P]-ATP to label the phosphoryl group, followed by SDS-PAGE separation of the products. Both KinC and KinD were weakly active on Spo0A and showed higher activity with the sof-1 mutant of Spo0A (Fig. 4). The sof-1 mutation allows enough direct phosphorylation of Spo0A to bypass both Spo0F and Spo0B *in vivo* and is known to provide a substrate for other kinases (Spiegelman et al., 1990; LeDeaux et al., 1995). Both KinC and KinD were much more active with Spo0F as a

KinD active *in vivo*, but poorly active, relative to KinA, *in vitro*? Comparisons between these kinases *in vitro* are fraught with problems of interpretation. Because of the membrane-spanning regions of the signal input domain of KinC and KinD, both kinases had to be produced in a soluble form by deleting the input domain. If the normally soluble KinA is produced as an input domain deletion, the activity on Spo0F falls drastically (Wang *et al.*, unpublished data). Therefore, the presence of the signal input domain may be required for the kinase to assume a correct conformation and may even contribute to catalysis or to response regulator specificity. However, KinE was produced intact and soluble, which may indicate that KinE is more sensitive to the requirement to be signal activated than KinA, and such signal ligands are missing in the purified preparations. One way to differentiate between several possibilities would be to test the activity of the proteins in the back reaction Spo0F~P + ADP → Spo0F + ATP. The reverse reaction and the reverse reaction rate are a measure of the affinity of the response regulator for the kinase, assuming that interaction specificity is the rate-limiting step. To assess this rate with the kinases, ${}^{32}$P-labelled Spo0F~P was prepared and purified. Samples of the labelled Spo0F~P were incubated with ADP, and equimolar concentrations of KinA, KinC, KinD or KinE and the products were separated by SDS-PAGE. The results of these experiments revealed that all four kinases dephosphorylated Spo0F~P with similar kinetics (Fig. 6A). In the absence of any kinase, Spo0F~P was stable over the period of the reactions. Furthermore, the ComP kinase, which was known to be highly active in phosphorylating its response regulator ComA (data not

shown), was inactive on Spo0F~P. Other non-specific kinases, such as *E. coli* NRⅡ, do not transfer phosphate to Spo0F when phosphorylated (L. Wang et al., unpublished data). When the products of the reactions were analysed by thin-layer chromatography and autoradiography, ATP was the major product (Fig. 6B). No ATP was produced by ComP. No net increase in Pi was observed for any kinase. The simplest explanation for the observed results is that all four kinases have about equal specificity for Spo0F.

### Discussion

Spo0A~P plays two roles in the lifecycle of *B. subtilis* depending on its cellular concentration. Low levels of Spo0A~P accumulate during growth and repress the *abrB* gene. As AbrB is a pleiotropic global transcription repressor of many genes, most of which are associated with stationary phase phenomena (Strauch, 1993), the initial production of Spo0A~P is required to allow normal progression of growing cells into stationary phase. This initial production may result from the sum of the action of all the kinases capable of phosphorylating Spo0F and Spo0A. In the absence of KinA and KinB, KinC and KinD are unable to generate sufficient Spo0A~P to promote the onset of sporulation. There are two major possible reasons for the inability of KinC and KinD to promote sporulation: KinC and KinD may not be expressed at the appropriate times, or the kinases are present, but not sufficiently active. All the evidence is consistent with differential activation rather than differential transcription or expression as the basis for the different roles of the kinases. The relative expression levels of the five kinases are not correlated with the time of the growth period in which they function. KinB is the most highly expressed of the kinases, and its level is highest during growth (Dartois et al., 1996). KinC is expressed maximally in the first hour of stationary phase but is inactive in inducing sporulation (LeDeaux et al., 1995). KinA, KinD and KinE are most highly expressed during growth and at equal levels (Fig. 7). Thus, timing of expression seems not to be a factor in selecting which kinase functions in the phosphorelay.

All the kinases are believed to be subject to activation by signal ligands unique to each kinase. The pattern of kinase function could be a reflection of the presence or absence of the activating ligand. KinC and KinD may respond to activating ligands that are present only during growth, whereas KinA and KinB may be dependent on signals present only during early stationary phase. A chimeric protein formed from the potential signal-responsive portion of KinA and the catalytic portion of KinB sporulates in the same way as a KinA⁺ strain (Dartois et al., 1997). Assuming the chimera is responsive to KinA ligands, this

result points to the role that such ligands may play in kinase function. In addition to signals activating kinases, there are opposing signals stimulating expression or activity of phosphatases for Spo0F~P and Spo0A~P (Perego et al., 1994). Although none of the signal ligands for any of these kinases has been identified, the signals play an important role in the timing of stationary phase and development.

There are circumstances in which KinC and KinD can be made to produce sufficient Spo0A~P for sporulation. Certain alanine-scanning mutants of Spo0F, i.e. L66A, H101A and I90A, are believed to alter the configuration of residues in the β4-α4 loop that is critical for kinase selection by Spo0F. In these mutants, KinC and/or KinD were able to raise the sporulation level of a *kinA-kinB* strain by six orders of magnitude to the wild-type level (Jiang et al., 1999). The Spo0F mutants bypass the hypothetical ligand activation of KinC and KinD by some unknown mechanism. These Spo0F mutations may make the response regulator resistant to negative regulators such as the Rap phosphatases, and this is sufficient to allow the accumulation of phosphorylated Spo0F at unchanged levels of KinC and KinD activation. It is also possible that the Spo0F mutations increase the avidity for, or reaction rate with, KinC and KinD, such that low levels of activating ligand are amplified into high levels of Spo0F~P. It has been proposed previously that possible

regulator molecules interacting with Spo0F might be mimicked by these mutations (Jiang et al., 1999). Thus, it may be possible that small molecule factors or additional proteins bind to response regulators and influence the kinase selection in the cell, and these selective factors are missing from the purified proteins. One example of such a molecule is calcium, which has dramatic effects on signal transduction in eukaryotic cells. This raises the possibility that not all signal input in two-component systems may come through the kinase. The available data do not allow proof of this possibility or others but, in this context, the results reinforce the notion that signal ligands are the most important determinant of which kinase is functional, not differential expression.

The genetic studies revealed that KinC phosphorylates Spo0A directly in the absence of Spo0F during growth, despite the *in vitro* results indicating that KinC prefers Spo0F as a substrate. KinC is known to be active in promoting sporulation in strains with certain *sof* single-site mutations in Spo0A (Kobayashi et al., 1995; LeDeaux et al., 1995), and both KinC and KinD are more active with *sof* mutant proteins *in vitro*. These mutations add further evidence to the fact that KinC may be made functional under sporulation conditions and suggests that some *sof* mutations may neutralize negative regulation or mimic the effects of selective factors on response regulators.

There seems to be little doubt that KinA is the predominant kinase activating sporulation in laboratory media. Whether this is true in nature where a wider range of environmental metabolites and conditions are found remains to be discovered. Perhaps the other kinases have specific environmental signal ligands that cannot be mimicked in laboratory media, and their absence relegates the kinases to a supporting role.

### Experimental procedures

#### Bacterial strains and growth conditions

*B. subtilis* strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. Strains were grown in Schaeffer's sporulation medium (Schaeffer et al., 1965). Transformations were carried out according to Anagnostopoulos and Spizizen (1961). Antibiotic selections were as follows: spectinomycin (*spc*) 50 μg ml⁻¹; chloramphenicol (*cat*) 5 μg ml⁻¹; erythromycin (*mls*) 1 μg ml⁻¹; tetracycline (*tet*) 15 μg ml⁻¹; kanamycin (*aph*) 2 μg ml⁻¹.

#### Protein expression and purification

Expression and purification of KinC and KinD fusion proteins to the maltose-binding protein (MBP) was carried out as described by Jiang et al. (1999). KinA, Spo0F and Spo0F-(His)₆ proteins were purified from overexpressing *E. coli* strains, as described previously (Perego et al., 1989; Zapf et al., 1996; Tzeng and Hoch, 1997). Spo0A and Spo0A–Sof1 were overexpressed from the T7 promoter of plasmid pET20b (Novagen) as C-terminal (His)6-tagged proteins. Purification from overproducing *E. coli* BL21(DE3) *plysS* strains was obtained by metal chelate affinity chromatography (Ni-NTA agarose; Qiagen) according to standard procedures. The KinE coding sequence was amplified from the chromosomal DNA of strain JH642 using oligonucleotides that introduced a *Ncol* site at the 5′ end and a *BamHI* site at the 3′ end of the fragment. Cloning in the *Ncol–BamHI* site of vector pET16b (Novagen) placed the *kinE* gene under the control of an inducible T7 promoter. The fidelity of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification was verified by sequence analysis. Protein expression was obtained in the *E. coli* JM109(DE3) strain by induction at OD~600~ = 0.7 with 1 mM IPTG. Cells were grown at 30°C for 4 h. The pellet from 8 l of culture was resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A: 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithiothreitol (DTT),

b. Isotopic integration.

0.2 mM phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF); lysozyme was added at 0.5 mg ml⁻¹ (final concentration), and incubation was carried out on ice for 1 h. DNase I and MgCl₂ were then added at 20 μg ml⁻¹ and 1 mM respectively. After centrifugation at 23 000 g for 40 min, the extract (102 ml) was precipitated with 51 ml of 3.6 M ammonium sulphate for 1 h on ice. The precipitate was collected by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 ml of buffer A and loaded on an Affigel Blue column (Pharmacia) (2.5 × 10 cm). The column was washed with 120 ml of buffer A, and the proteins were eluted in two steps with 120 ml of buffer A–NaCl 25 mM and buffer A–NaCl 1 M. Fractions from the buffer A–NaCl 1 M elution were pooled and precipitated with 1.8 M ammonium sulphate. After centrifugation, the pellet was resuspended in 5 ml of buffer A and loaded on an S-300 sizing column. The KinE protein was eluted with buffer A–NaCl 0.15 M at 0.6 ml min⁻¹. Peak fractions were pooled and concentrated with a Centricon 30 concentrator (Amicon).

### Purification of Spo0F~P

Spo0F-(His)₆ (50 μM) was labelled by KinA (0.5 μM) and [γ³²P]-ATP in a standard phosphorylation assay (see below) in a volume of 240 μl. After 1 h incubation at room temperature, the mixture was incubated with 0.5 ml of a 50% slurry of Ni-nitriloacetic acid (NTA) agarose (Qiagen) that had previously been equilibrated with binding buffer (500 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) at 4°C for 1 h. The resin was packed in a minicolumn and washed with 25 ml of binding buffer. A second wash was carried out with 20 ml of binding buffer containing 10 mM imidazole. After a third wash with 20 ml of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl), elution of Spo0F(His)₆~P was obtained with wash buffer containing 0.1 mM EDTA and 100 mM imidazole. Fractions (500 μl) were collected, and 10 μl of each was checked on a 12% SDS–polyacrylamide gel exposed to Kodak X-Omat AR film. Four fractions containing Spo0F (His)₆~P were pooled and dialysed in 800 ml of 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA and 5% glycerol. Protein concentration was determined with the BCA protein assay reagents (Pierce) using BSA as standard.

### Phosphorylation assays

Time courses of phosphorylation of response regulators by kinases were carried out in 100 μl volumes in the standard reaction buffer (50 mM EPPS, pH 8.0, 20 mM MgCl₂, 0.2 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol). A sample of 5 μl of ATP mix [2.5 μl of 8 mM ATP and 2.5 μl of [γ-³²P]-ATP at 6000 Ci mol⁻¹ (Amersham)] was added to initiate the reaction. Aliquots (15 μl) were withdrawn at various times, and the reactions were stopped with 3 μl of 5 × SDS–PAGE loading buffer and frozen immediately in dry ice.

Back reactions with Spo0F(His)₆~P (1 μM) and 0.2 μM kinases (KinA, C, D, E, ComP) were carried out in a 200 μl total volume in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 50 mM KCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 5% glycerol, 5 mM MgCl₂ and 0.5 mM ADP. Time points were taken at the indicated times (15 μl), and the reactions were stopped by the addition of 3 μl of SDS–PAGE loading buffer, then frozen in dry ice.

Reaction products were loaded on 15% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and run at 200 V with constant voltage. Gels were immediately exposed to Kodak X-Omat RP films at –80°C or dried under vacuum and analysed by volume integration using the IMAGEQUANT software on a Molecular Dynamics PhosphorImager.

#### Analytical TLC

Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed according to the method of Randerath and Randerath (1967) with some modifications. A sample of 1 μl from the back reactions at a 20 min time point was applied to Polygram Cell 300 PEI cellulose plates (Alltech Chromatography) that were predeveloped in water. Chromatography was carried out in 0.75 M KH₂PO₄, pH 3.75, for 1 h. The plate was dried and exposed to X-ray film.

#### β-Galactosidase assays

β-Galactosidase assays were carried out as described previously (Ferrari et al., 1988). β-Galactosidase activity was measured in Miller units (Miller, 1972). Cultures were grown in Schaeffer’s sporulation medium (Schaeffer et al., 1965).
