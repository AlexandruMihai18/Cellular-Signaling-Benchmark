Abstract

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurological disorder characterized by the selective loss of motor neurons. A pathological hallmark of both sporadic and familial ALS is the presence of abnormal accumulations of neurofilament and peripherin proteins in motor neurons. In the past decade, transgenic mouse approaches have been used to address the role of such cytoskeletal abnormalities in motor neuron disease and also to unravel the pathogenesis caused by mutations in the gene coding for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) that account for ~20% of familial ALS cases. In mouse models, disparate effects could result from different types of intermediate filament (IF) aggregates. Perikaryal IF accumulations induced by the overexpression of any of the three wild-type neurofilament proteins were quite well tolerated by motor neurons. Indeed, perikaryal swellings provoked by NF-H overexpression can even confer protection against toxicity of mutant SOD1. Other types of IF aggregates seem neurotoxic, such as those found in transgenic mice overexpressing either peripherin or an assembly-disrupting NF-L mutant. Moreover, understanding the toxicity of SOD1 mutations has been surprisingly difficult. The analysis of transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD1 has yielded complex results, suggesting that multiple pathways may contribute to disease that include the involvement of non-neuronal cells.

1. Introduction

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is an adult-onset neurological disorder that is characterized by the selective degeneration of lower and/or upper motor neurons leading to progressive weakness, atrophy of skeletal muscles and eventual paralysis and death within 2–5 years of clinical onset. Approximately 10% of ALS cases are familial, the remainder being diagnosed as sporadic (90%) with no known genetic component. However, multiple genetic and environmental factors have been implicated in the pathogenesis of ALS [1].

The discovery, a decade ago, of missense mutations in the gene coding for the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase 1 (mSOD1) in subsets of familial cases directed most ALS research to elucidating the mechanism of SOD1-mediated disease. However, elucidating the toxicity of SOD1 mutants has been surprisingly difficult. Another question central to understanding the pathogenesis of ALS is the role of the intermediate filament (IF) accumulations that occur in degenerating motor neurons. Currently, it is still unknown if these IF accumulations actively participate in the neurodegenerative mechanism, or are innocent bystanders occurring as a response to neuronal injury or, indeed, a mechanism of neuroprotection acting by sequestering toxic molecules from their intended target(s). A lot of effort has been spent in recent years to elucidate the role of these cytoskeletal abnormalities in ALS pathogenesis, including studies in transgenic mice; however, the results have been complex. In this review, we focus on the pathogenic pathways of motor neuron disease in transgenic mouse models with SOD1 mutations and with neuronal IF abnormalities.

2. Primary causes of ALS

Little is known about the genetic defects that cause or predispose to ALS. So far, over 90 missense mutations have been discovered in the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase gene (SOD1) that account for ~20% familial ALS cases [2] for

review, see [3,4] A recent breakthrough was the discovery of deletion mutations in coding exons of a new gene mapping to chromosome 2q33, ALS2, from patients with an autosomal recessive form of juvenile ALS [5,6] The ALS2 gene is ubiquitously expressed and it encodes a protein having domains homologous to nucleotide exchange factors for GT-Pases and Dbl-pleckstrin, a characteristic of Rho-type GT-Pases involved in various signaling cascades, membrane transport and organization of the cytoskeleton.

Codon deletions or insertion in the KSP phosphorylation domain of the neurofilament NF-H gene have been identified in a small number of sporadic ALS patients (~1% cases) [7–9] whereas no such NF-H mutants have been detected in over 1000 control DNA samples. The search for mutations in all coding regions of the three neurofilament genes has failed to reveal additional mutations linked to ALS cases [10,11]. Nonetheless, mutations in the rod domain of the NF-L and NF-M genes have recently been reported in cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2 and Parkinson’s disease, respectively [10–14]. Even though the combined results support the view that neurofilament abnormalities can induce pathogenesis, it is concluded that mutations in neurofilament genes as primary causes of disease must account for only a small proportion of cases in these diseases.

### 3. Abnormal IF accumulations

All IF proteins share the same tripartite structure of an alpha-helical rod domain flanked by non-alpha-helical N-terminal ‘head’ and C-terminal ‘tail’ domains. The rod domains of cytoplasmic IF proteins are highly conserved in sequence and length, having approximately 310 amino acid residues [15]. There are three major IF types expressed in adult neurons: neurofilaments, α-internexin and peripherin. Neurofilaments (NF) are the most abundant neuronal IF proteins, being expressed in most neurons of the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems [16,17]. They comprise three protein subunits, NF-L of 68–70 kD, NF-M of 150–160 kD and NF-H of 200–210 kD. Alpha-internexin, a 66-kD protein, is expressed mainly in the CNS [18,19]. Peripherin, a 58-kD protein, is expressed mostly in the PNS and in some neuronal populations of the CNS [20–22]. However, after neuronal injury, peripherin expression increases neuronal subsets in both the CNS and PNS [23,24]

The presence of abnormal IF accumulations in the perikaryon and axon of motor neurons constitutes a pathological hallmark of both sporadic and familial ALS [25,26]. Neurofilament proteins, together with peripherin, are detected in the majority of axonal inclusion bodies, called spheroids, in motor neurons of ALS patients [27] (Fig. 1). Many factors can potentially lead to the accumulation of IF proteins including deregulation of IF protein synthesis, proteolysis, defective axonal transport, abnormal phosphorylation, and other protein modifications. There is evidence of deregulated expression of neurofilament genes in ALS from

in situ hybridization studies that revealed the selective reduction in levels of NF-L mRNA in degenerating spinal motor neurons of ALS cases [28]. It appears paradoxical that the reduction of NF-L mRNA levels (~87%) is even more pronounced in neurons with neurofilament accumulations. However, because of its role in neurofilament assembly and transport, a deficiency in NF-L can provoke the sequestration of NF-M and NF-H proteins in the cell bodies of motor neurons, as revealed from the analysis of NF-L knockout mice [29]. In addition, disorganized IF structures and intracellular transport defects could result from post-translational modifications. Of particular interest is the recent finding that excitotoxicity can induce neurofilament side-arm hyperphosphorylation in neurons and a slowing of neurofilament transport [30]. The phosphorylation of neurofilaments induced by increases in glutamate may occur via members of the MAPK family including p42/p44MAPK and stress-activated protein kinases. Other post-translational modifications may also contribute to NF disorganization. Advanced glycation products and nitration of tyrosine residues are detected in NF inclusions of ALS [31,32]. However, the extent of nitration in the NF-L protein from the spinal cord of sporadic ALS cases does not differ from age-matched controls [33]

### 4. Transgenic mice with neurofilament alterations

#### 4.1. Mice knockout for IF genes

Surprisingly, mice knockout for peripherin or any of the type IV IF proteins, i.e. the three neurofilament proteins and α-internexin, does not develop overt phenotypes and gross developmental defects [29,34–38]. In addition, double knockout mice deficient for both α-internexin and NF-L also

exhibit no overt phenotypes [39] Although none of these IF proteins are essential for nervous system development, their deficiencies are not completely innocuous. The reduction in the caliber of myelinated axons lacking neurofilaments is accompanied by up to 50% reduction in conduction velocity [40], a feature that would be very detrimental for large animal species. A significant loss of motor axons has also been detected in the NF-L null mice [29] and in double NF-M/NF-H knockout mice [38]. Regeneration studies showed delayed maturation of regenerating myelinated axons in NF-L–/– mice [29], whereas in either NF-M or NF-H null mice the velocity of transport of slow components in the axon was increased and alterations occurred in the neuronal cytoskeleton such as a higher abundance of microtubules [34, 38]. A striking feature of the NF-L knockout mice is the accumulation of NF-M and NF-H proteins in the perikaryon of motor neurons even though the absence of NF-L provoked an ~90% reduction of NF-H and NF-M protein levels in nervous tissue. In peripherin knockout mice, the number and caliber of myelinated motor and sensory axons in the L5 roots remained unchanged, but there was a substantial reduction (~34%) in the number of L5 unmyelinated sensory axons, demonstrating a requirement of peripherin for the proper development of a subset of sensory neurons.

neurofilament genes were generally well tolerated in mice and did not provoke massive death of motor neurons. The proof that neurofilament abnormalities can induce neuronal death in vivo came from the expression of an assembly-disrupting NF-L transgene having a Leucine to Proline substitution near the end of the conserved rod domain [47]. Mice expressing this NF-L mutant at only 50% of the endogenous NF-L level exhibited, within 4 weeks after birth, a massive loss of motor neurons. Although no such NF-L mutations have been reported in human ALS, similar mutations in keratins cause severe forms of skin diseases [15]. However, the mechanism of toxicity of mutant NF-L is not fully understood. Increasing the levels of Bcl-2 did not protect the large motor neurons from the toxicity of mutant NF-L [48]. A plausible mechanism is the “strangulation of axonal transport hypothesis” in which neurofilament accumulations can interfere with the axonal transport machinery [3, 4].

### 4.3. Peripherin overexpressors

Unlike other types of neuronal IF proteins, the sustained overexpression of wild-type peripherin in mice caused the selective death of motor neurons during aging (Table 1) [49]. Moreover, it induced the formation of perikaryal and axonal IF inclusions resembling spheroids found in human ALS. The onset of neuronal death was precipitated by the absence of NF-L, as revealed by cross-breeding of peripherin transgenic mice with NF-L knockout mice. This context is reminiscent of the findings in ALS, as described above, in which there is a reduction of NF-L mRNA levels in affected motor neurons [28, 50]. These transgenic mouse studies suggest that peripherin may be an important etiological factor in ALS.

The toxicity of peripherin overexpression in mice may be related in part to the axonal localization of IF aggregates. This is supported by the rescue of peripherin-mediated disease in mice by the overexpression of NF-H transgene (our unpublished observation). One interpretation is that perikaryal sequestering of excess peripherin protein reduces the formation of deleterious axonal IF accumulations. Other mechanisms may likely contribute to the toxicity of peripherin overexpression. Peripherin overexpression was also

### 4.2. Neurofilament overexpressors

The overexpression in mice of any of the three wild-type neurofilament subunits alone can induce the formation of neurofilament accumulations in neuronal cell bodies [41–43]. For example, high-level expression of human NF-H proteins caused large perikaryal neurofilament accumulations resulting in atrophy of motor axons and altered axonal conductances but without motor neuron death even in 2-year-old mice [44, 45]. Remarkably, overexpressing NF-L in NF-H transgenic mice reduced the perikaryal swellings and rescued the motor neuron dysfunction, illustrating again the importance of subunit stoichiometry for proper neurofilament assembly and transport [46]. It is noteworthy that perikaryal swellings induced by overexpression of normal

shown to decrease the viability of cultured motor neurons after intranuclear microinjection of expression plasmid containing peripherin [51]. The peripherin toxicity in cultured motor neurons was attenuated by co-expression of NF-L, providing additional evidence that stoichiometric ratios of peripherin and neurofilament proteins are important for neuronal survival.

In vitro studies have shown that dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from peripherin transgenic embryos die when grown in a proinflammatory CNS culture environment rich in activated microglia [51]. The death of DRG neurons containing peripherin aggregates was mediated by tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), a major proinflammatory cytokine released by activated microglia. This experiment suggests that peripherin aggregates might predispose neurons to the deleterious effects of a proinflammatory environment. In ALS, proinflammatory markers, such as activated microglia, are associated with degenerating motor neurons [1]. As microglia are specific to the CNS, this may in part account for the neuronal selectivity in ALS. Another consideration is that proinflammatory cytokines can induce the expression of peripherin [52, 53]. Therefore, cytokines released by activated microglia may not only induce death of neurons containing peripherin aggregates but may also actively participate in forming aggregates by further stimulating increased expression of peripherin.

### 5. Disease caused by SOD1 mutations

#### 5.1. Complex pathways to neuronal death

Unraveling the toxicity of SOD1 mutants has been particularly challenging. Initially, studies have focused on aberrant copper-mediated catalysis as potential sources of toxicity. One hypothesis was that misfolding of SOD1 induced by mutations would allow the access of abnormal substrates such as peroxynitrite to the catalytic site leading to the nitration of tyrosine residues [54]. Another proposal suggested that SOD1 mutants have an enhanced ability to use hydrogen peroxide as a substrate to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals that can damage cellular targets including DNA, protein and lipid membranes [55]. However, neither the peroxynitrite nor peroxidase activity hypotheses were supported by transgenic mouse studies. First, the elimination of endogenous SOD1 or addition of wild-type SOD1 did not affect disease progression in mice expressing mutant SOD1<sup>G85R</sup> [56]. Second, the gene knockout for the copper chaperone for SOD1 (CCS) that delivers copper to SOD1 catalytic site did not affect disease progression in mutant SOD1 transgenic mice [57].

Currently, the most prevailing view is that the toxicity of SOD1 mutants is related to the propensity of misfolded protein mutants to form aggregates [56, 58–61]. Yet, the toxicity of these protein aggregates is still poorly understood. Deleterious effects could result from the co-sequestration of essential cellular components and from overwhelming the capacity of the protein folding chaperones and/or of ubiquitin proteosome pathway to degrade important cellular regulatory factors. Somehow, the axonal transport machinery is also affected. Transgenic mice expressing mutant SOD1 exhibit reduced rates of slow axonal transport [62, 63]. Such transport defects may explain the presence of abnormal IF accumulations in human ALS cases with SOD1 mutations [26] and in transgenic mice expressing SOD1 mutants [45, 64, 65].

Evidence to date suggests that the neuronal death pathway in ALS is complex and that it involves multiple cascades of events including the formation of protein aggregates, oxidative damage, mitochondrial defects, alterations in calcium homeostasis, caspase activation and changes in the levels of Bcl-2 apoptosis (Fig. 2) [4]. Surprisingly, either the overexpression of NF-H or the disruption of NF-L gene, which raises perikaryal neurofilament protein content and lowers axonal levels, extended the life span of mutant SOD1 mice by several weeks [66–69]. In search of plausible mechanisms for protective effects of perikaryal neurofilament accumulations, we discovered a deregulation of cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) activity in SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice [70].

#### 5.2. Cdk5 deregulation

The abnormal subcellular localization of Cdk5 has been observed in several neurodegenerative diseases including ALS [71], Alzheimer's disease (AD) [72, 73], Parkinson's disease [74] as well as in canine motor neuron disease [75]. Patrick et al. [76] reported the accumulation of p25, a truncated form of the Cdk5 activator p35, in the brains of patients with AD. Unlike p35, p25 is not targeted to the plasma membrane sequestering Cdk5 away from normal compartments of p35/Cdk5, deregulating its activity. Expression of the p25/Cdk5 complex in cultured cortical neurons induced cytoskeletal abnormalities and apoptosis [76, 77]. The overexpression of p25 in the CNS of transgenic mice caused hyperphosphorylation of tau and neurofilaments, cytoskeletal disruption and behavioral deficits [78]. Moreover, transgenic mice that overexpress p25 under the PDGF promoter develop a motor neuron disease and paralysis reminiscent of ALS [79].

Our recent studies with mice expressing mutant SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> revealed a Cdk5 involvement in ALS pathogenesis [70]. A mislocalization and upregulation of Cdk5 activity was detected in SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice, which is associated with an increase of p25 to p35 ratio. Cdk5 deregulation in the SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice is accompanied by the abnormal hyperphosphorylation of tau, a phenomenon that could affect microtubule stability and functions. Interestingly, this hyperphosphorylation of tau in SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice was attenuated in the context of NF-H overexpression or NF-L knockout [70]. From these results, we have proposed that perikaryal neurofilament accumulations may confer protection by acting as a phosphorylation sink for Cdk5 activity, thereby reducing

### 5.3. Non-neuronal deleterious factors in mutant SOD1 mice

In addition to intrinsic neuronal defects, there is growing evidence that non-neuronal deleterious effects may also be involved in the pathogenic process in ALS. Neuron-specific expression of transgenes encoding mutant SOD1 in mice was not sufficient to induce motor neuron disease [80,81]. Astrocyte dysfunction and microglial activation are likely to be involved in the neurodegenerative process [82–88]. In mice expressing mutant SOD1, there is a reduction in the astroglial glutamate transporter EAAT2 that may provoke a glutamate-induced excitotoxicity. Excess glutamate can cause cell death via abnormal activation of neuronal glutamate receptors that activates voltage-dependent Ca²⁺ channels, allowing Ca²⁺ entry into the cell and altering cytosolic free Ca²⁺ homeostasis. Moreover, robust NF-kB activity and expression of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines were detected by in situ hybridization within the spinal cord in SOD1G37R mice [89] However, to what extent an inflammatory response and chronic innate immune activation might contribute directly to neurodegeneration in disease caused by mutant SOD1 remains to be resolved.

### 6. Transgenic mice with defective axonal transport

#### 6.1. Tau overexpressors

Tau is a microtubule-associated protein involved in the stabilization of microtubules. Abnormalities of tau in human disease are known as tauopathies, including AD, frontotemporal dementia with parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP-17), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/parkinsonism-dementia complex [90]. Tau comprises six isoforms of 55–62 kD that are derived from a single gene via alternative splicing of the primary gene transcript. Transfection experiments with cultured neuroblastoma cells and cortical neurons showed that overexpression of tau induces the accumulation of neurofilaments and organelles such as mitochondria and peroxisomes in cell bodies by inhibiting their association with the axonal transport motor [91]. Overexpression of tau in these studies inhibited transport along microtubules in the plus-end direction.

Transgenic mice overexpressing the shortest tau isoform (three-repeat isoform lacking N-terminal inserts) exhibit axonal degeneration of spinal neurons and motor weakness [92]. These tau transgenic mice are characterized at an early age by insoluble filamentous aggregates of hyperphosphorylated tau in spinal neurons that occur mostly as axonal spheroids. Neurofilaments are also associated with these aggregates, demonstrating that abnormalities in tau protein can

directly affect neurofilaments. Remarkably, the tau-mediated disease can be attenuated by reducing the neurofilament content as revealed by breeding experiments involving tau transgenic mice and NF-L knockout mice [93] This led to the hypothesis that neurofilaments may act as chaperones in the development of tau aggregates, supporting the role of neurofilaments in the pathogenesis of some forms of tauopathies.

### 6.2. Dynamitin

Additional support for the view that axonal transport defects may play a critical role in the pathogenesis of ALS came from inhibition of the retrograde transport machinery in mice. Dynein is a molecular motor involved in retrograde axonal transport of organelles along microtubules. Dynein activity requires association with dynactin, a multiprotein complex that activates the motor function of dynein and participates in cargo attachment [94,95] The overexpression of the dynamitin p50 subunit of dynactin can inhibit dynein-mediated processes through dissociation of dynactin [94,96] Transgenic mice overexpressing dynamitin develop a late-onset and progressive motor neuron disease resembling ALS with neurofilamentous swellings in motor axons [97]

### 7. Testing therapeutic approaches in ALS mouse models

There is currently no effective pharmacological treatment for ALS. However, the availability of transgenic mice models of ALS has provided a unique opportunity to test pharmacological approaches to slow disease progression. Table 2 lists some of the drugs tested so far. Riluzole, a glutamate antagonist and the only drug currently approved for ALS treatment [98] extended the life span of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice by 10–15 d without affecting disease onset [99,100] More protection was provided in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice by the intra-cerebroventricular administration of N-benzylloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethylketone (zVAD-fmk), a broad caspase inhibitor [101] or with creatine added to drinking water, a compound believed to improve mitochondrial function [102] Vitamin E, gabapentin and salicylate had no effect on the survival of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice [99,103]

So far, the best pharmacological approach has been with minocycline [104–106], a second-generation tetracycline with anti-inflammatory properties [107] For instance, administration of minocycline into the diet, beginning at the late presymptomatic stage (7 or 9 months of age), delayed the onset of motor neuron degeneration and Cdk5 deregulation, muscle strength decline and increased the longevity of SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice by ~5 weeks for ~70% of tested mice [106] Moreover, less microgliosis occurred in the spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G37R</sup> mice treated with minocycline. These tests in transgenic mouse models suggest that minocycline, which is clinically well tolerated, may represent an effective drug for the treatment of human ALS.

### 8. Conclusion

Studies with transgenic mouse models showed that ALS pathogenesis is complex, involving both neuronal and non-neuronal deleterious factors. The abnormal IF accumulations, a hallmark of ALS, emerged as intrinsic factors that may affect the disease either negatively or positively. Yet, the cascades of events underlying the formation and neurotoxicity of IF accumulations are not fully understood. Deleterious IF structures could result from a variety of primary causes including neurofilament gene mutations [47], deregulation of IF gene expression [49], post-translational modifications and axonal transport defects [63,92,97] Severe motor neuron loss has been observed in many transgenic mouse models exhibiting an axonal localization of IF swellings supporting the “axonal strangulation” disease model by which IF swellings can block axonal transport [4] Other toxic mechanisms may also be involved. For instance, in vitro culture studies showed that neuronal cells exhibiting peripherin aggregates can undergo apoptotic death when cultured in a proinflammatory CNS environment [51] In this case, the presence of IF aggregates may be viewed as a factor that lowers the threshold to neuronal death in a toxic environment.

ingly, perikaryal neurofilament accumulations are sometimes well tolerated and they even have beneficial effects. For example, the perikaryal accumulation of neurofilaments induced by NF-H overexpression alleviated the toxicity of mutant SOD1 in mice, perhaps by acting as a phosphorylation sink for deregulated Cdk5 activity [70]

Due to the length of the axon, motor neurons are especially vulnerable to changes that may affect the intracellular transport. Compelling evidence for the key role of axonal transport in pathogenesis of motor neuron disease was recently provided by the inhibition of molecular motors in transgenic mice [97]. The over expression of either tau to inhibit anterograde (kinesin-dependent) transport or dynamin to disrupt the dynein-dependent retrograde transport caused motor neuron degeneration with characteristic IF accumulations. These results support the view that neurofilament transport is in part mediated by the kinesin and dynein/dynactin motors.

In spite of the effort devoted in the past decade toward elucidating the disease caused by SOD1 mutations, the neurodegeneration pathway is not fully understood. In light of the emerging evidence for the crucial role of axonal transport in motor neuron disease, there is a need to examine whether cytoskeletal and other molecular changes are associated with the toxicity of mutant SOD1. A better understanding of the disease mechanisms will also come from identification of new genes associated with ALS. A recent breakthrough was the discovery of deletion mutations in a new gene mapping to chromosome 2q33, *ALS2*, from patients with an autosomal recessive form of juvenile ALS [5,6]. The *ALS2* gene is ubiquitously expressed and it encodes a protein having domains homologous to those characteristics of Rho-type GTPases that are involved in various signaling cascades, membrane transport and organization of the cytoskeleton. Future studies with mice models of *ALS2* should provide useful insights into mechanisms of motor neuron degeneration.
