### SUMMARY

Radioactive bisnorbiotin, $\alpha$-dehydrobisnorbiotin, tetranorbiotin, urea, and uracil have been isolated from culture filtrates of a pseudomonad grown on a biotin-salts medium to which ${}^{14}$C-carbonyl-labeled biotin was added.

These findings establish that the side chain of biotin is degraded by $\beta$-oxidation with loss of 2 acetate units, and that after the complete degradation of the side chain of biotin, oxidation of both carbons bridging the ureido to thiophane rings occurs, producing urea which is degraded to $CO_2$ and $NH_3$ by urease.

The relatively high radioactivity found in uracil may indicate not only the participation of carbamyl phosphate from the $CO_2$ and $NH_3$ produced from urea, but an additional direct cyclization of a catabolite which retains the ureido function.

Bisnorbiotin${}^1$ and bisnorbiotin sulfoxide have been isolated quite recently as degradation products of biotin from culture filtrates of an *Endomycopsis* grown on biotin-supplemented medium (14). The studies mentioned above suggest the presence of $\beta$-oxidation systems for the side chain of biotin in living systems. Recent studies from this laboratory have described the total degradation of ${}^{14}$C-carbonyl- and carboxyl-labeled biotin by whole cells and broken-cell preparations from a pseudomonad which was grown on biotin as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur (5). Investigations of the catabolism of ${}^{14}$C-biotin and certain of its analogues with particulate systems of this bacteria have broadly delineated the activation, inhibition, and substrate specificity of the bacterial system (7). In addition, ${}^{14}$C-norbiotin and trisnorbiotin were isolated from reaction mixtures which initially contained ${}^{14}$C-homobiotin (15). From these latter studies, it appears likely that $\beta$-oxidation of the side chain of biotin in the bacterial system proceeds through loss of 2 acetate units and that complete oxidation of the side chain may be prerequisite for cleavage of the ureido ring. Peroxidative attack of the sulfur may be needed before opening the thiophane ring.

It has been recognized that the catabolism of biotin occurs in a large variety of organisms (1–7). However, few of the details of the process were well understood. The production of ${}^{14}$CO$_2$ from ${}^{14}$C-carboxyl-labeled biotin had been shown in various animal tissues (8–10). More recently, it was shown that biotin-grown cells of a soil bacterium catalyze the oxidation of biotin-2-${}^{14}$C to ${}^{14}$CO$_2$ (11, 12). Broken-cell preparations of the same bacterium, supplemented with coenzyme A, ATP, and Mg$^{++}$, convert biotin-2-${}^{14}$C to ${}^{14}$CO$_2$ and small amounts of ${}^{14}$C-labeled acetoacetate, which suggests that the oxidation of the biotin side chain yields acetate. It was demonstrated that enzyme preparations from pig liver and a soil bacterium catalyze the formation of biotinyl 5'-adenylate and biotinyl-CoA (13).

### EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

#### Materials

The strain of bacterium used was described previously (5). Crystalline $d$-biotin was purchased from Hoffmann-La Roche, Inc., Nutley, New Jersey. The ${}^{14}$C-carbonyl-labeled biotin (32.4 mCi per mmole) was obtained from Nuclear-Chicago. A sample of bisnorbiotin was a gift from Dr. K. Ogata, Kyoto University, Japan. The crystalline urease was a gift from Dr. W. Visek, Cornell University.

${}^1$ Conventional prefixes used to indicate the length of the aliphatic carboxylic acid side chain of biotin or dethiobiotin are nor-, bisnor-, trisnor-, and tetrnor- for the 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-carbon shorter analogues, respectively, and homo- for the 1-carbon longer compound.

active materials were eluted with 300 ml of water. The eluate was concentrated to 50 ml, poured over a column of Dowex 50W-X8 (2.5 × 35 cm), and ${ }^{14}$C-compounds were eluted with 1.2 liters of water. Material which washed through quickly (A-1) was thus separated from that (A-2) weakly retained by the cation exchanger.

Fraction A-1 was concentrated to dryness and the residue suspended in 1 ml of methanol. The insoluble ${ }^{14}$C-material, A-1-A, was collected by centrifugation, recrystallized three times from water, and washed with methanol and ether for 5 mg of final product. The methanolic supernatant solution was applied to a sheet of Whatman No. 1 paper (46 × 57 cm) and the chromatogram developed in descending 1-butanol-formic acid-water (4:1:1, v/v/v) for two additional radioactive materials, A-1-B and the slower moving A-1-C.

Fraction A-2 was concentrated to dryness, the residue dissolved in 0.5 ml of methanol, and insoluble material removed by centrifugation. Ether (10 ml) was added to the supernatant solution, which was then stored at $0^{\circ}$ overnight. The precipitate formed was collected by centrifugation and washed with ether several times for 12 mg of white, radioactive powder.

Fractions B and C—These crude fractions, which eluted in the region known for sulfoxides, were also rechromatographed on a column (1.5 × 70 cm) of Dowex 1-X2 (formate). The two main fractions were separately concentrated to dryness, and each was dissolved in 0.2 ml of methanol. Ether (10 volumes) was added to each solution. The ${ }^{14}$C-precipitates were collected by centrifugation and dried for 10 mg of B and 5 mg of C, both as slightly brown powders.

Fraction D—The dried material from this fraction, which eluted in the region known for biotin, contained two radioactive substances, D-1 and D-2, which were resolved on paper chromatograms developed in descending 1-butanol-formic acid-water (4:1:1, v/v/v). The radioactive substances were eluted with water from the paper chromatograms. Both ${ }^{14}$C-materials were concentrated to dryness and recrystallized from water three times. In this way 20 mg of the faster moving D-1 and 5 mg of the slower moving D-2 were obtained.

Fraction E—This material was dissolved in 10 ml of methanol, which was partially evaporated at room temperature. The crystalline ${ }^{14}$C-material formed was collected, washed with a small amount of methanol and ether, and dried for 9 mg.

Fraction F—The dried material of Fraction F was dissolved in 15 ml of methanol, and an equal volume of ether was added. The small amount of precipitate formed was removed by centrifugation and discarded. The supernatant solution was concentrated to dryness, the residue dissolved in 5 ml of hot methanol, and the solution stored overnight at $0^{\circ}$. The crystalline material was collected and recrystallized three times from methanol for 500 mg of the pure ${ }^{14}$C-product.

Analytical Techniques

Appropriate aliquots were applied to sheets of Whatman No. 1 chromatography paper, and the sheets were developed in descending 1-butanol-acetic acid-water (2:1:1, v/v/v) or 1-butanol-formic acid-water (4:1:1, v/v/v). Chromatograms were cut into strips 3.5 cm wide, which were counted with an Actigraph III (Nuclear-Chicago radiochromatogram scanner). Ultraviolet absorbing compounds were detected under a Mineralight ultraviolet lamp.

Melting points were determined on a Fisher-Johns melting

**RESULTS**

**Characterization of Compounds**

The findings from analytical techniques applied to elucidation of the structures of the \({ }^{14} \mathrm{C}\)-compounds isolated will be briefly described with representative examples and comparisons with known standards.

Paper Chromatography—Mobilities of the \({ }^{14} \mathrm{C}\)-compounds isolated and certain standards were compared on paper chromatograms. The same \(R_{f}\) values of 0.51 to 0.52 were found for A-1-A and uracil in both butanol-formic acid-water and butanol-acetic acid-water; values of 0.54 to 0.55 were found for A-2 and urea in both solvents. The \(R_{f}\) values for B and biotin \(d\)-sulfoxide, D-1 and biotin, and D-2 and bisnorbiotin were 0.49, 0.85, and 0.61 with butanol-formic acid-water, and 0.59, 0.86, and 0.70 with butanol-acetic acid-water, respectively. Other \({ }^{14} \mathrm{C}\)-metabolites did not correspond to known compounds.

Mass Spectra—The molecular weights determined for the \({ }^{14} \mathrm{C}\)-compounds isolated were compared with those calculated for the known compounds. The significance of these figures leads to a unique assignment of elemental composition for each compound. In addition, the particular fragmentation pattern obtained from the high resolution spectrometry employed indicates the similarity in parts of the structure for related com-

those of a preparation of commercial urea. The determined molecular weight of 60.036 establishes the elemental composition as CH₄N₂O. The infrared spectra of isolated and commercial urea are the same. The specific radioactivity based on full retention of carbonyl label from biotin indicated a molecular weight of 70 or less, which is in good agreement with the exact figure of 60. After several hours of incubation of the ¹⁴C-compound with purified urease at room temperature, 98% loss of radioactivity as CO₂ occurred and formation of ammonium ion was observed by nesslerization.

Compound B—The position of elution of this fairly water-soluble, acid metabolite from Dowex 1 (formate) and its behavior on paper chromatograms were shown to be the same as for synthetic biotin *d*-sulfoxide. The determined molecular weight of 260.084 establishes an elemental composition of C₁₀H₁₆N₂O₄S, which is 1 more oxygen atom than in biotin. The fragmentation pattern obtained from mass spectrometry indicates the overall biotin-type bicyclic ring system which can form the characteristic 2-keto-5-methenyl imidazolium ion with a mass of 97 on electron bombardment. The infrared spectra of isolated and synthetic biotin *d*-sulfoxide are completely the same, although the melting point is somewhat lower than reported (18). However, the isolated ¹⁴C-compound was found to be radiochemically pure.

Compound D-1—This ¹⁴C-compound was proved to be remaining biotin by the identical elution from columns and mobilities on paper, molecular weight of 244.314 with elemental composition of C₁₀H₁₆N₂O₃S and fragmentation pattern, infrared and NMR spectra, specific radioactivity, and melting point of 229–231°.

Compound D-2—The position of elution of this acid metabolite from Dowex 1 (formate) is the same as bisnorbiotin isolated from other microorganisms, and the mobilities of isolated and known compounds on paper chromatograms are identical. The determined molecular weight of 216.057 establishes an elemental composition of C₈H₁₂N₂O₃S, and the biotin-like fragmentation

also show complete disappearance of side chain methylene protons. The NMR spectrum of this heretofore unknown compound is compared with that of biotin in Fig. 4.

Identification of Compounds

Through summation of the above chromatographic and spectral findings, the identification of several of the ¹⁴C-metabolites derived from carbonyl-labeled biotin will now be presented with additional data on melting points, specific radioactivities, and elemental analyses.

Compound A-1-A—This metabolite was shown to be neutral by its lack of retention on cation and anion exchangers, and to have the same mobilities on paper as does commercially obtained uracil. The determined molecular weight of 112.088 can only be ascribed to C₄H₄N₂O₂. The infrared spectra of this isolated and the commercial uracil are identical. Also, ultraviolet absorption is the same with λ_max at 260 mμ and λ_min at 230 mμ in aqueous solution. The specific radioactivity was found to be a seventh that of the initial ¹⁴C-biotin.

Compound A-2—This metabolite was shown to be very weakly basic by its slight retention on Dowex 50 (H⁺). The mobilities of isolated compound on paper chromatograms are the same as

pattern exhibits the characteristic 2-keto-5-methenyl imidazolium ion. The infrared spectrum is identical with bisnorbiotin isolated previously, and the spectra of both samples are generally similar to biotin. The NMR characterization shows the absence of two of the four methylene groups present in the aliphatic side chain of biotin. The melting point of the \({ }^{14} \mathrm{C}\)-compound is \(210-212^{\circ}\), which is very close to \(213-216^{\circ}\) reported earlier for bisnorbiotin (14); also, no decrease in a mixed melting point of the two samples was observed. The same compound, bisnorbiotin, has now been isolated from culture filtrates of *Penicillium oxalicum* as well (19). The identity of this catabolite is confirmed by microanalysis.

\end{aligned}
\]

Compound E—This acid metabolite, which is retained somewhat better than biotin on Dowex 1 (formate), appears to be more polar than biotin, as the latter moves faster in the somewhat nonpolar solvents used for paper chromatography. The determined molecular weight of 214.040 establishes an elemental composition of \(\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \mathrm{~S}\), which is 2 fewer hydrogen atoms than bisnorbiotin, and the biotin-like fragmentation pattern exhibits the characteristic 2-keto-5-methenyl imidazolium ion. The infrared spectrum indicates the unsaturation which by NMR can be absolutely assigned to the \(\alpha-\beta\) position in the carboxyl side chain. The melting point of this catabolite, heretofore unknown in nature, is \(235-236^{\circ}\).

Compound F—The last principal acid metabolite which is eluted from Dowex 1 (formate) did not appear to be a known compound from its \(R_{F}\) values measured on paper chromatograms. The determined molecular weight of 188.027 establishes an elemental composition of \(\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{8} \mathrm{~N}_{2} \mathrm{O}_{3} \mathrm{~S}\), which is supported by the data from microanalysis.

\end{aligned}
\]

Although the mass spectrographic fragmentation exhibits the characteristic 2-keto-5-methenyl imidazolium ion, the infrared spectrum suggests the immediate substitution of carboxyl function on the thiophane ring portion. This is confirmed by total absence of side chain aliphatic methylene protons in the NMR spectrum. The specific radioactivity for this \({ }^{14} \mathrm{C}\)-tetranorbiotin is in agreement with that expected from loss of the side chain. The melting point of this new catabolite is \(213-214^{\circ}\). Also, tritium-labeled tetranorbiotin has now been isolated from cultures of the pseudomonad supplied with \({ }^{3} \mathrm{H}\)-biotin.

DISCUSSION

It was reported earlier (5, 7) that biotin \(d\)-sulfoxide was effectively degraded by the pseudomonad used in the present study. With the current isolation of biotin \(d\)-sulfoxide from culture media of the bacteria, a degradative pathway for biotin in which the \(d\)-sulfoxide is produced by oxidation of the vitamin becomes reasonable.

![Chemical Structures](https://i.imgur.com/yourimage.png)

SCHEME 1

It had been suggested (5, 7) that β-oxidation of the side chain of biotin may be involved in the degradation process in the pseudomonad, and norbiotin and trisnorbiotin have been isolated from incubation of homobiotin with particulate preparations of this organism (15), but the present isolation and identification of bisnorbiotin, α-dehydrobisnorbiotin, and tetranorbiotin confirms the function of such a system with biotin. The biodegradative intermediates with acid side chains 2 carbon atoms shorter than those of biotin, biotin sulfoxide (14), and dethiobi- tin (20, 21), and with an acid side chain 4 carbon atoms shorter than that of dethiobiotin (21) had already been isolated from other microorganisms. All of these findings broadly support the presence of β-oxidative systems for the side chain of biotin in living systems. The isolation of tetranorbiotin in the present study further supports the thesis that complete oxidation of the side chain of biotin is prerequisite for degradation of either ring portion of biotin.

Earlier results (5) demonstrated that NH₄⁺, HCO₃⁻, and SO₄²⁻ were produced as end products during the degradation of biotin by the pseudomonad used in the present study. However, no details for degradation of the ring portion of biotin were understood. In the present study, isolation of urea as one product from biotin proves that oxidation of the vitamin must ultimately occur at both bridged positions in the bicyclic structure. This probably occurs after oxidation of the thiophane ring by a reaction similar to that of urea formation from the ureido portion of pyrimidines and purines. The urea is finally degraded by urease present in the bacteria.³

An interesting additional result from the present work is that conservation of the carbonyl carbon from biotin is quite high in the isolated ¹⁴C-uracil. This may suggest a route in addition to the known formation of carbamyl phosphate from CO₂ plus NH₃ and subsequent incorporation over several steps into pyrimidines. With oxidation of the thiophane ring sulfur and α,β-dehydrogenation of tetranorbiotin, ring expansion with decarboxylation could conceivably lead to the direct formation of uracil.

From these findings the following metabolic pathway for biotin in the bacteria is proposed in which only those compounds established in the present work are shown. More definitive conclusions about the metabolic fate of biotin must await the identification of more catabolites, especially those derived from initial cleavage of the bicyclic ring system of biotin.
