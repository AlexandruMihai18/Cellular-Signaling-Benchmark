modules had a higher tendency to be co-expressed, to co-localize, and to be evolutionarily conserved across species in an all-or-none fashion. These findings are not fundamentally new [13, 14] but they do emphasize the challenges ahead. Beyond reporting correlations over genome-wide datasets, more detailed information can be gained at multiple organizational levels; for example, by comparing each module with another to derive the properties of individual modules.

### Concluding remarks and future perspectives

Interactions within cells, whether physical or functional, are instrumental in understanding the cellular machinery. These recent studies [2, 3] provide an advance in delineating the organization of the proteome. More analysis must be done to derive a consensual and benchmarked set of complexes out of these datasets and to evaluate the biological function of modules. The next stage will be the dynamic analysis of protein complexes on a large scale. TAP-MS can capture the dynamics of interactions, for example, as demonstrated in the comparative study of the human tumour necrosis factor pathway in stimulated and resting cells [15]. Similar to the way cells integrate input signals, create connectivity to process signals and output the results, the next challenge is to integrate these different networks and their dynamics into a more comprehensive picture of cellular machines and their function. This will accelerate the determination of systems properties for specific machines and even, eventually, for whole cells.

Natural genetic transformation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that is widely distributed in bacteria and requires assembly of a DNA uptake machinery. Transformable bacteria use fundamentally the same machine, which in most species is assembled only in cells that are developing competence. Competence regulation usually differs between unrelated species. Here, we examine whether related streptococci use the same competence regulatory cascade. Phylogenetic analyses of streptococcal genome sequences reveal the existence

of two paralogous two-component regulatory systems, either of which might control competence. This suggests the distribution of streptococci into two groups that use competence regulatory cascades that have at least partly evolved independently. Comparison of data obtained with two transformable streptococci, *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Streptococcus mutans*, provides support to this suggestion.

#### Genetic transformation and competence

Natural genetic transformation is a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer that is widely distributed among

taxonomic groups (including Archaea); it has been found to occur in ~40 different species [1]. Transformation depends on a DNA uptake machinery that includes proteins related to those involved in the assembly of type IV pili and in type II secretion systems [2,3]. In most transformable species, expression of this machinery is tightly regulated and occurs only in cells that are in the process of developing competence. Comparison of two well-documented transformation systems, those of the soil-dweller Bacillus subtilis [4] and the human pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae [5], showed that the two species have independently evolved competence regulatory circuits most adapted to their own lifestyle [6,7]. Nevertheless, could data obtained with a given species be extrapolated to related species, at least those sharing a similar niche? Examination of the situation with transformable streptococci provides some clues.

### The S. pneumoniae model

In S. pneumoniae, competence is induced by a small peptide pheromone, the competence stimulating peptide (CSP). CSP is an unmodified 17-residue peptide [8], exported and matured by ComA-ComB, a dedicated ABC exporter, which removes a leader peptide after a Gly-Gly motif (double-glycine leader) [9] in the 45-residue pre-CSP encoded by comC [10]. A dedicated two-component regulatory system (TCS), ComDE, detects extracellular CSP and transmits a signal that leads to transcriptional activation of the competence regulon. By analogy with other TCSs, it is assumed that CSP binding stimulates the polytopic, membrane-embedded histidine kinase (HK) ComD to autophosphorylate and transfer a phosphoryl group to its cognate response regulator (RR), ComE. ComE belongs to the AgrA/AlgR/LytR family of RRs [11]. Phosphorylated ComE directly activates expression of the so-called early com genes, which are preceded by a direct repeat to which ComE binds [12]. The early genes include comAB and comCDE (Figure 1), comW (see later) and comX [13], which encodes a competence-specific sigma factor [14]. ComX recognizes a conserved –10 σ^X promoter, designated the combobox or cin-box [5], which is present in front of the late com genes. The late com genes include those that encode the machinery for DNA uptake and processing [5,7].

This regulatory cascade leads to the autocatalytic accumulation of CSP once a critical threshold is attained, which probably accounts for the high degree of competence synchrony in pneumococcal cultures. It also results in an extremely fast response to CSP. Upon CSP addition, transcription of the early and late genes reaches a maximum after 5–7 minutes and 10–12 minutes, respectively [15–19]. Pneumococcal competence is also tightly controlled at the post-transcriptional level [7]. Thus, the early gene product ComW is required to activate ComX (by a yet unknown mechanism) and to prevent ClpP-dependent proteolysis of the competence-specific σ^X [20]. Such regulation presumably makes the expression of late genes more strictly dependent on ComE signalling and could prevent adventitious competence development resulting from read-through transcription of the comX genes [21].

Percentage of identical amino acids between S. pneumoniae Blp and Com components are indicated between parentheses. Key to colours: pheromone response genes include the RR (red) and HK genes (orange); pheromone export genes include those that encode ABC proteins (dark blue) and accessory proteins (light blue). Pheromone-encoding genes are in green. Percentage of identical amino acids between Streptococcus mutans Com (or Csl) proteins and S. pneumoniae Blp and Com components are indicated above and below the S. mutans genetic organization diagram, respectively. Red flags indicate binding sites for the corresponding RR (E, ComE; R, BlpR). S. mutans comC and cslB are separated by ~7.5 kb DNA that contains several ORFs encoding putative bacteriocins with double-glycine leaders. bsmA, bsmH and blpI also encode candidate bacteriocins. S. pneumoniae comC and comA are more than 45 kb apart (and separated by orf). Corresponding annotations in the S. mutans genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/viewer.fcgi?val=AE014133) are as follows: cslB, smu.1900; cslA, smu.1897 and smu.1898 (underlined); bsmH, smu.1896.**

### Natural transformation and the presence of ComX in streptococci

In addition to S. pneumoniae, genetic transformation has been reported in Streptococcus gordonii (formerly Streptococcus sanguis Challis) and in the odontopathic bacterium Streptococcus mutans [1] and, more recently, in members of the viridans group of streptococci [22]. It is, therefore, not surprising that these species encode a ComX-like σ factor (Figure 2). Homologues of S. pneumoniae proteins required for the uptake of DNA and its processing into recombinants are also found in these species [23,24]. It is more surprising to find that a ComX orthologue is encoded in all streptococcal genomes sequenced so far (Figure 2) and in all other Lactobacillales (Lactococcus lactis, Lactobacillus plantarum, Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcus faecium; data not shown). Amino acid identity ranges from 38% (Streptococcus thermophilus) to 46% (S. mutans) and up to 92% (Streptococcus mitis), and from 29% (L. lactis) to 27% (E. faecium). Can this observation be taken as an indication that most streptococcal species are naturally transformable and fundamentally use the same alternative σ^X factor for com gene expression? The presence of key competence-regulatory proteins, particularly homologues of the ComDE TCS that regulates ComX activity both directly and indirectly in S. pneumoniae, could help to predict new transformable species [6].

The phylogenetic tree is based on 16S rRNA sequences of streptococcus type strains retrieved from the Ribosomal Database Project II (http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/) [40]. The six phylogenetic groups defined previously [41] are indicated with a colour code (vertical bars). Streptococcus pneumoniae and Streptococcus mutans are indicated by red horizontal arrows. Plus symbols (+) in the 'Transformability' column indicate species for which natural transformation has been documented. Filled and unfilled circles in the 'Genome sequence' column indicate availability of finished and unfinished (not yet released) genome sequences. Filled diamonds indicate the presence and number of copies of comX gene(s) identified through TBLASTN searches in the corresponding genome. The PCR column refers to the detection (+) or absence (-) of the comCDE chromosomal region in the study of Havarstein and co-workers [22]. Filled squares indicate the presence of Com, Blp or Fas TCSs. Half-filled symbols indicate that the gene or protein is present only in some isolates in the corresponding species. The half-filled square in parentheses indicates that the corresponding ORF contained a frameshift. Sequence alignments were carried out using ClustalX [42] and edited with SEAVIEW [43]. The phylogenetic analyses were performed with PHYLO_WIN [43] and distances were estimated with the substitution model of Tamura and Nei [44]. The tree is unrooted and was reconstructed using the neighbour-joining method on alignment positions without a gap [45]. For each sample, 500 bootstrap replicates were computed and only bootstrap values >50% are reported on branches.**

BlpRH and that the two species could have recruited different TCSs to control competence. It prompted us to analyze the distribution and phylogenetic relationships of ComDE homologues in species of the genus *Streptococcus*. Similarity searches using ComD, ComE, BlpR and BlpH proteins of *S. pneumoniae* as queries were performed on finished and unfinished (not yet released) genomes of streptocci. To enlarge the *Streptococcus* species coverage, ComDE homologues were also identified by scanning the non-redundant database. After discarding the sequence redundancy caused by sequencing of different strains of the same species, a final set of 16 RR and 21 HK proteins has been obtained from 14 streptoccal species (as of February 28, 2006). This set includes proteins that control streptokinase gene expression in group A and C streptococci (the Fas system [29]). The phylogenetic trees showed that streptococcal ComE homologues distribute into three distinct clusters, referred to as Com, Blp and Fas (Figure 3), consistent with a previous analysis on the RR proteins of those systems [29]. In each cluster, the branch topology is in agreement with the tree obtained on 16S rRNA (Figure 2). Heterogeneity in branch length in Blp clusters suggests a rapid evolution of proteins in the family. This evolution could be favoured by a gain-and-loss mechanism that can occur because these TCSs control bacteriocin production and are, therefore, not as important as TCSs that control the competence regulon in *S. pneumoniae* or virulence in *Staphylococcus aureus*. Fas could represent an emerging cluster.

It is of note that HK–RR pairs defined experimentally (e.g. *S. pneumoniae* ComDE) and HK and RR proteins encoded by genes in the same chromosomal neighbourhood follow parallel evolutionary trajectories, except for a few tree rearrangements that involved branches with the lowest bootstrap supports (<53%). On both trees, the *S. suis* homologues are located between Com and Blp clusters.

Genes encoding ComDE orthologues were previously detected only in members of the mitis and anginosus phylogenetic groups [22]. However, because this study was based on PCR reactions using the tRNA genes flanking *comDE* in *S. pneumoniae* (see later), it could have missed orthologues with a different genetic organization in other streptocci. Nevertheless, analysis of genome sequences accumulated since then strongly suggests that ComDE orthologues are restricted to the mitis and anginosus groups (Figure 2). This clustering is well supported by a bootstrap of 100% (Figure 3). It was previously noticed that the *S. pneumoniae comCDE* operon exhibited a rather low GC content for the species (~30%) and was flanked by tRNAs, two features commonly associated with pathogeni-

Figure 3. Phylogenetic trees of the RR (left) and the HK (right) proteins. For the HK proteins, the tree was computed using the histidine kinase domains. The three clusters are identified by different colours: Com (dark blue), Blp (light blue) and Fas (mid-blue). Only streptococci belonging to the mitis and anginosus groups harbour a Com orthologue (with the noticeable exception of *Streptococcus suis*, although the *comDE* locus present in one of the two sequenced isolates exhibits an atypical chromosomal location, distant from *ori*; data not shown). *Streptococcus pneumoniae* and *Streptococcus mutans* proteins are indicated by red horizontal arrows. Members of the prototype *Staphylococcus Agr* family were used as an outgroup. Species are identified by a four-letter code: Saga, *S. agalactiae*; Sang, *S. anginosus*; Saur, *Staphylococcus aureus*; Scon, *S. constellatus*; Sepi, *Staphylococcus epidermidis*; Sequ, *S. equi*; Sgor, *S. gordonii*; Shae, *Staphylococcus haemolyticus*; Sinf, *S. infantis*; Sint, *S. intermedius*; Smil, *S. milleri*; Smit, *S. mitis*; Sora, *S. oralis*; Spne, *S. pneumoniae*; Spyo, *S. pyogenes*; Ssui, *S. suis*; Sthe, *S. thermophilus*. Except for the Com and Blp proteins of *S. pneumoniae*, each streptococcal protein in the ComE–BlpR tree (left) was given a number between 1 and 19. Identical numbers in the ComD–BlpH tree (right) identify cognate kinases. Numbers 20–22 in the right-hand tree correspond to ‘orphan’ kinases for which the sequence of the corresponding *comE* gene was not available; numbers 17b and 18b correspond to two homologous kinases for each FasA RR. (See the online Supplementary Material for the corresponding protein lists.) Trees were constructed as described for Figure 2 but distances were estimated using the PAM (percent accepted mutation) model of amino acid substitution and sequences of the *Staphylococcus Agr* system (highlighted in grey) were used as an outgroup.
city islands [30]. These characteristics could indicate that this piece of DNA was acquired by lateral gene transfer. The clustering we observe suggests a scenario in which this acquisition has occurred at an early stage before differentiation into the mitis and anginosus groups. By contrast, because orthologues of BlpRH are found in all streptococci investigated so far (Figure 2) with the exception of some *S. pyogenes* strains [6], it is likely that this system was present in a common ancestor. With respect to *S. mutans*, our phylogenetic analysis confirms that this species has a BlpRH-type TCS but no ComDE orthologue.

### Inferences on the regulation of competence in streptococci

Analysis of the available genome sequences of *S. mitis* and *S. gordonii* suggests that these species use competence regulatory cascades that are highly related to that of *S. pneumoniae*. Thus, their *comCDE* operon is similarly located close to *ori*, the putative origin of chromosome replication. Both species also encode orthologues of ComAB (data not shown) and two copies of *comX* (Figure 2). In view of these similarities, it is most likely that *S. mitis* and *S. gordonii* are highly similar to *S. pneumoniae* with respect to the regulation of competence. However, a gene encoding a ComW-like protein was detected in *S. mitis* but not in *S. gordonii* (using TBLASTN; our observations), which suggests that *S. gordonii* might use a different mechanism to control ComX. Nevertheless, we propose that *S. pneumoniae* is the paradigm for naturally transformable streptococcal species belonging to the mitis and anginosus groups. By contrast, *S. pneumoniae* should not be considered the paradigm for other streptococcal species because these lack a ComDE orthologue. Examination of the *S. mutans* competence regulatory cascade strongly supports this view.

### *S. mutans* and *S. pneumoniae* competence regulatory cascades differ

In addition to the observation that *S. mutans* 'ComDE' is orthologous to *S. pneumoniae* BlpRH (Figure 3), we found that the *S. mutans* CSP exporter, CslAB [31], is the orthologue of *S. pneumoniae* BlpAB (Figure 1; and data not shown). [Note that the two genes annotated as *comAB* (smu.0286–0287) in the genome sequence of *S. mutans* (AE014133) are not involved in CSP export and were, therefore, proposed to be renamed *nlmTE* [32].] Interestingly, whereas in ComA the three functional domains of the ABC exporter (an ATP-hydrolysing domain, a membrane domain for peptide translocation, and a proteolytic, N-terminal domain) are fused [5], the proteolytic domain constitutes an independent polypeptide in both BlpA and CslA [underlined open reading frames (ORFs) in Figure 1]. It was previously noticed that the genetic organization of the *S. mutans com-csl* system differed from that of the *comCDE* genes in *S. pneumoniae* [28]. Whereas the *comCDE* genetic organization has only been observed in streptococci belonging to the mitis and anginosus groups [22], the *S. mutans com-csl* gene arrangement is strikingly similar to that of the *S. pneumoniae* Blp system (Figure 1). This microsynteny constitutes an additional argument in favour of a common evolutionary origin of the *S. mutans*

Com and *S. pneumoniae* Blp systems. Together, these observations clearly establish that different TCSs have been recruited to regulate competence in *S. mutans* and *S. pneumoniae*. It is also of note that, unlike the situation in *S. pneumoniae*, *S. mutans comCDE* is not located at *ori*. This could result in further differences in competence regulation between the two species because it has been proposed that this co-location provided the capacity for coordinating competence and the initiation of replication [33].

Several experimental data also indicate that *S. pneumoniae* and *S. mutans* competence regulatory cascades differ. Thus, it is particularly striking that *S. mutans* cells do not become competent soon after CSP addition; instead, transformation exhibits a maximum in the exponential growth phase only after a ~2 h delay [34]. This result suggests that, in *S. mutans*, the expression of *comX* is not directly regulated by ‘ComE’. By contrast, expression of *S. mutans nlmAB*, which encodes the two-peptide bacteriocin NlmAB (mutacin IV), is rapidly induced by CSP [34]. *nlmAB* expression is dependent on ‘ComE’ but not on ComX. It relies on the presence of a direct repeat upstream of *nlmAB*, the sequence of which fits with the consensus binding sequence proposed for RRs of the AlgR/AgrA/LytR family [11], and is likely to represent a binding site for ‘ComE’ [35]. This direct control of mutacin IV production by *S. mutans* ‘ComDE’ is reminiscent of the involvement of *S. pneumoniae* BlpRH in the control of a regulon that essentially encodes bacteriocin-like peptides [26,27], and is fully consistent with the direct phylogenetic relationship that we propose. It strongly suggests that the primary function of *S. mutans* ‘ComDE’ is in the regulation of bacteriocin production and not in the regulation of competence.

No ‘ComE’ binding site could be detected in front of the *comX* gene [35], which is fully consistent with the conclusion that *comX* expression is not directly regulated by ‘ComE’. It is, therefore, not surprising that inactivation of ‘*comE*’ has a different impact on genetic transformation in this species. A ‘*comE*’ (and ‘*comC*’ or ‘*comD*’) mutant of *S. mutans* was reported to have a high residual level of transformation [28], whereas *S. pneumoniae comE* (or *comABCD*) mutants have no detectable transformation.

DNA sequence analysis also revealed additional substantial differences between *S. pneumoniae* and *S. mutans* competence regulatory circuits. First, no ‘ComE’ binding site could be detected upstream of the ‘*comDE*’ genes [35]. This situation is reminiscent of that of the *blpRH* genes of *S. pneumoniae*, which are not induced in response to BIP [26]. Second, we did not detect a ‘ComE’ binding site in front of the genes encoding the CSP exporter, *cslA-cslB*. This implied that *S. mutans* lacks the autoinduction mechanism that results in higher rates of CSP synthesis and secretion, and amplifies the response to CSP in *S. pneumoniae* [5]. Using TBLASTN, we also failed to detect a gene in the *S. mutans* genome that would encode a protein homologous to *S. pneumoniae* ComW. Finally, it was recently established that inactivation of *ciaH* but not of *ciaR* (which encode a HK and its cognate RR, respectively) significantly reduced the expression of *comDE* in *S. mutans* [36]. This is in contrast

Figure 4. Independent evolution of competence regulatory cascades in streptococci. In *Streptococcus pneumoniae* (green text) but not in *Streptococcus mutans* (blue text), CSP triggers direct activation of *comCDE* and *comX* expression by ComE (red arrows). Therefore, autocatalytic CSP accumulation occurs only in *S. pneumoniae*. This difference between *S. pneumoniae* and *S. mutans* is attributed to the recruitment of paralogous TCSs (and paralogous pheromone exporters; see Figures 1 and Figure 2) to regulate competence. To avoid misleading parallels between the two species, we suggest renaming the *S. mutans* system BlpCHR to the name of the *S. pneumoniae* orthologue, as done here. The ~2 h delay before induction of *S. mutans* transformation by BIP (CSP) [34] suggests that *comX* induction is indirect and/or that ComX requires activation by some unknown mechanism (dotted red line and question mark).

to *S. pneumoniae*, in which inactivation of *ciaR* resulted in competence upregulation [5].

We conclude that, despite the use of the same alternative σ<sup>X</sup> factor for *com* gene expression, *S. pneumoniae* and *S. mutans* have evolved completely different regulatory circuits to control the production, activity and stability of this factor (Figure 4). Although the nature of the connection between ‘ComE’ and *comX* gene expression in *S. mutans* remains to be established, the case of *S. mutans* might represent a current example of the idea that competence regulation evolved by co-opting a bacteriocin regulator. The use of the same name (ComDE) to designate paralogous TCSs that differently affect competence development in the two species is, therefore, misleading because it conveys the idea that a common competence regulatory circuit operates in both species, which is clearly not the case (Figure 4).

Concluding remarks and future perspectives

As previously observed in *S. pyogenes* [37], all streptococcal genomes sequenced so far contain not only a *comX* gene (Figure 2) but also genes that potentially encode DNA uptake and processing functions (data not shown). These genes are preceded by bona fide *cin*-boxes and, in the case of *S. pyogenes*, could be transcribed *in vitro* with the core polymerase associated with σ<sup>X</sup> [38]. What about their transformability and the control of *comX*? Altogether, the observations discussed earlier suggest that *S. pneumoniae* can be considered the paradigm for streptococci equipped with a Com-type TCS (i.e. those belonging to the mitis and anginosus groups; Figure 2), whereas *S. mutans* could serve as a model for streptococci that can only rely on Blp-type TCSs for the regulation of competence (Figure 3). Therefore, we propose that whatever their niche (the oral cavity or the nasopharynx), species that harbour a Com-type TCS are likely to be readily transformable and will then use orthologues of the *S. pneumoniae* ComDE TCS to control *comX* transcription directly.

By contrast, all *S. mutans*-like species should follow the *S. mutans* paradigm. They will use orthologues of the *S. pneumoniae* BlpRH TCS (as does *S. mutans*) to control *comX* expression by an as yet uncharacterized indirect mechanism. Thus, any attempt at transforming such species should incorporate a long delay between the addition of synthetic candidate peptide pheromone to trigger competence and the transformation assay. In light of these observations, it would be interesting to reinvestigate competence induction in the *S. pyogenes* clinical isolate, which encodes an *S. pneumoniae* BlpABCRH-like system [6] and was previously reported to be capable of DNA transfer in mixed cultures (although the involvement of transformation was not formally established) [39].

In most cases, species phylogenetic relatedness is, therefore, probably the best criterion to be used to predict not only whether a species is naturally transformable but also which part of a competence regulatory cascade it could share with a model transformable organism (Figure 4).
