Summary: Innate and antigen-specific antiviral immunity are triggered by immunorecognition of viral nucleic acids. The helicase retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) (also known as DDX58) is the key sensor of negative strand RNA viruses in the cytosol of cells. RNA containing a triphosphate at the 5′-end was shown to activate RIG-I, but the exact structure of RNA supporting 5′-triphosphate recognition, the requirement of a 5′-triphosphate group, as well as the existence of RNA structures detected by RIG-I in the absence of 5′-triphosphate remain controversial. Here, we revisit the literature on RIG-I and RIG-I ligands. The literature proposes at least six different RIG-I ligands: (i) single strand with a 5′-triphosphate, (ii) double-stranded RNA with a 5′-triphosphate, (iii) 5′-triphosphate single-stranded RNA with A- and U-rich 3′-sequences, (iv) double-stranded RNA of intermediate length (>300 and <2000 bp) without 5′-triphosphate, (v) blunt-end short double-stranded RNA (23–30 bp) without 5′-triphosphate, and (vi) short double-stranded RNA (23–30 bp) with 5′-monophosphate. RIG-I thus seems promiscuous for a variety of different RNA molecules, very similar to the Toll-like receptors, of which 10 family members are sufficient for the safe detection of the microbial cosmos. In the light of these outstanding publications, it seems an unlikely possibility that there is a fundamental shortcoming in the design of all studies. Looking closely, the only issue that comes to mind is the in vitro transcription technique used by all investigators without confirming the identity of RNA products. This technique, together with the different biological systems used, the lack of dose responses and of proper comparison of different published ligands and controls leave us with more questions than answers as to what the exact RIG-I ligand is, if in fact it exists.

Immunorecognition of viral RNA

Viral infections provoke early innate and subsequent adaptive immune responses. The receptor repertoire of the innate immune system is equipped to detect a wide range of viral infections and activates a set of genes including type I interferons (IFNs), which confer antiviral activity to the host (1). Immunorecognition of viruses is based on the detection of viral nucleic acids. Three members of the family of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) detect viral RNA either at the cell surface or in the endosome (2). Endosomal TLR7 and TLR8 are activated by single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) containing G and U (3–5); TLR7 but not TLR8 is

able to detect short double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) in a sequence-dependent manner (6). Surface or endosomal TLR3 detects long dsRNA, particularly the synthetic cohomopolymer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) (7, 8).

While TLR3, TLR7, and TLR8 detect RNA at locations at which self-RNA is not expected under physiological conditions (cell surface, endosome), due to abundant cytosolic self-RNA, detection of viral RNA in the cytoplasm follows different rules. Long dsRNA is widely accepted as a virus-associated nucleic acid pattern normally absent in mammalian cells (9). Receptors proposed to detect long dsRNA in the cytosol of cells include dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (10), 2′-5′-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS), and specifically the retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) family of cytoplasmic RNA helicases.

RIG-I-like helicases (RLHs) play a key role in sensing RNA virus invasion and comprise three helicases, RIG-I (also known as DDX58) (11), melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5) (11–14), and laboratory of genetics and physiology 2 (LGP2) (11, 15–17). RIG-I and MDA5 contain two caspase-recruitment domains (CARDs) and a DExD/H-box helicase domain. The helicase domains of RIG-I and MDA5 recognize viral RNAs, and their CARDs are responsible for signaling through the interaction with a CARD-containing adapter, IFN-β promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1) (18, 19), also called mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS), CARD-adaptor inducing IFN-β (CARDIF), and virus-induced signaling adapter (VISA) (20–22), which is located in the mitochondrial membrane. This interaction activates several transcriptional factors, IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3), IRF7, and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) for the induction of type I IFN and proinflammatory cytokines (23–25).

By contrast, LGP2 does not possess a CARD but only a DExD/H-box helicase domain. The function of LGP2 in the innate immune system is less well understood. Rothenfusser et al. (17) demonstrated that over-expression of LGP2 inhibits Sendai virus (SV)-induced type I IFN in murine and human cell lines; SV is a negative strand RNA virus detected by RIG-I. However, in vivo knockout of LGP2 revealed seemingly disparate antiviral responses (26). Although LGP2−/− murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were shown to be more sensitive to polyI:C in vitro, the LGP2−/− mice were more susceptible to encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (26), a picornavirus detected by MDA5 similar to polyI:C (14). However LGP2−/− mice survived a high titer vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) infection (negative strand virus), which was lethal for wildtype mice (26). Together the data available support a

regulatory role of LGP2, especially of the RIG-I-mediated pathway (15, 17, 26–28).

Recent studies have demonstrated that RIG-I and MDA5 are differentially involved in antiviral responses. As demonstrated for EMCV, picornaviruses are specifically recognized by MDA5. Other picornaviruses include polio virus, rhino virus, Theiler virus, Mengo virus, and foot-and-mouth disease. RIG-I is reported to be responsible for the detection of the large family of negative strand viruses including Newcastle disease virus (NDV), SV, VSV, influenza, and rabies virus (14, 29–32). Some viruses such as dengue virus (positive strand RNA virus) and reovirus (dsRNA virus) were shown to be recognized by both RIG-I and MDA5 (28, 33). The so-called IFN-producing cell (IPC), also called plasmacytoid dendritic cell (PDC), is not responsible for the majority of type I IFN production in RNA virus infection and may not be critical for all types and courses of infection as shown for EMCV (14).

### 5′-triphosphate RNA

While long dsRNA was the first type of nucleic acid ligand proposed for RIG-I, more recently, a number of studies suggested that in addition to long dsRNA, the presence of a triphosphate group at the 5′-end of RNA (5′-triphosphate RNA) is another molecular feature that is used by the innate immune system to distinguish viral from self-RNA (14, 31, 32, 34) and that processing of the 5′-triphosphate ends is used by viruses to escape immunorecognition (30) (Table 1). The first hint came from Kim et al. (35), who reported that cytosolic delivery of siRNA or ssRNA oligonucleotides generated by in vitro transcription induces type I IFN. They proposed that the 5′-triphosphate end of such RNA triggers the recognition. Later on, Kato et al. (14) observed that in vitro-transcribed long dsRNA activates RIG-I even more than the dsRNA mimic polyI:C. Then 5′-triphosphate RNA was identified as specific ligand for RIG-I (31, 32, 34). In our work, 19-mer and 24-mer single strand (sense or anti-sense) and dsRNA oligonucleotides generated by in vitro transcription and thus carrying a triphosphate at the 5′-end induced IFN-α in primary human monocytes and in MEFs. 5′-Monophosphate RNA and 5′-diphosphate RNA showed no activity. Activity required a length of at least 19 nucleotides. The activity was reduced or abolished when the RNA contained pseudouridine or 2-thio-uridine, when the ribose contained a 2′-O-methyl modification, or the triphosphate group was capped. In this work, due to technical reasons, approximately 20% of RNA oligonucleotides remained uncapped, explaining the residual

IFN-inducing activity. The requirement of RIG-I was 20 ng/ml IFN-β. Coexpression of T7 polymerase and its template in HEK293 cells resulted in a RIG-I-dependent IFN response. Genomic RNA isolated from rabies virus (negative control) did not induce IFN-β.
strand virus) induced IFN-α in a triphosphate- and RIG-I-dependent manner. Binding to RIG-I protein required an intact helicase domain. Surprisingly, identical sequences used in the work by Marques et al. (36) but with a 5′-triphosphate end showed no difference in activity in our experimental system irrespective of having a 2-nt 3′-overhang or a blunt end. In our unpublished findings, these sequences without 5′-triphosphate [molecules identical to Marques et al. (36)] did not induce any detectable IFN-α protein in human monocytes. Both results are in contrast to Marques’ data obtained from the cell line T98G (IFN-inducible protein p56), suggesting different levels of sensitivity of read-outs or distinct preferences of RIG-I in different cell systems.

The second seminal work on 5′-triphosphate RNA and RIG-I from Pichlmair et al. (34) reports that the ssRNA genome of influenza virus induces IFN-α in murine bone marrow dendritic cells. Phosphate but not triphosphate dependency was proved by dephosphorylation. The response to influenza viral RNA was RIG-I dependent, as it was inhibited by dominant negative RIG-I or by siRNA-mediated knockdown of RIG-I in either mouse or human cells. NS1 suppressed the response to influenza viral RNA, and this suppression was partly relieved by two-point mutations previously reported to attenuate NS1 binding to RNA. RIG-I was shown to preferentially form stable complexes with RNA containing phosphorylated 5′-ends; furthermore, NS1 was found to be recruited to such complexes via its RNA binding domain.

In general, a triphosphate is initially present at the 5′-end of all viral or self-RNA molecules, both of which are generated by RNA polymerases. However, in eukaryotes, RNA synthesis takes place in the nucleus, and RNA is processed and modified by cleavage, capping, and base modifications in the nucleolus before the RNA is released to the cytoplasm. This explains why self-RNA in the cytosol is not recognized by RIG-I, while viral genomic RNA generated by viral polymerases in the cytoplasm activates RIG-I due to the free 5′-triphosphate end.

### Long dsRNA and polyI:C

PolyI:C is regarded as a relatively nuclease stable synthetic mimic of long dsRNA (uncleaved polyI:C, 4–8 kb). PolyI and polyC are synthesized as separate strands by the bacterial enzyme polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPase), which catalyzes the polymerization of nucleotidediphosphate (37). Because polyI and polyC, unlike polymerization with T7 polymerase, are synthesized using inosine and ribocytosine diphosphates as substrates, polyI:C does not contain a 5′-tri- phosphate; furthermore, dsRNA fragments resulting from RNase III cleavage carry a 5′-monophosphate.

The molecular structure and activation of TLR3 by polyI:C is well characterized (7, 8, 38–40). Besides TLR3, early in vitro studies suggested that both RIG-I and MDA5 can bind and respond to polyI:C (15). In vivo, MDA5 was shown to be essential for polyI:C-induced IFN-α production and TLR3 signaling is critical for IL-12 production, whereas both MDA5 and TLR3 regulate IL-6 production (13, 14). Surprisingly, although polyI:C is regarded as a mimic of long dsRNA, long dsRNA generated by in vitro transcription (50–1000 bp) is not recognized by MDA5 but is detected by RIG-I, as evidenced by the lack of type I IFN induction in RIG-I−/− mice (14). These results questioned that long dsRNA (50–1000 bp) is a ligand for MDA5, and, from this study (14), it was concluded that RIG-I and MDA5 may distinguish nucleotide structure or sequence but not length. However, in this study, RNA lengths up to 1000 bp were studied. In a more recent study (41), the same group now reports that MDA5 recognizes dsRNA longer than 1000 bp, while RIG-I preferentially detects dsRNA of 300–1000 bp. In this latter study (41), polyI:C was converted to a RIG-I ligand by cleavage, resulting in lengths down to 300 bp. Based on their findings, the authors concluded that RIG-I and MDA5 preferentially bind to short (term short in this work refers to dsRNA of 300–1000 bp) and long (term long in this work refers to dsRNA longer than 1000 bp) polyI:C, respectively. In addition, the authors found that dsRNA prepared from viruses differentially activated RIG-I and MDA5, depending on the length of the viral RNA. VSV was demonstrated to contain shorter dsRNA (2.2 kb) than EMCV, while no dsRNA was detected for influenza. From their results, the authors concluded that dsRNA without 5′-triphosphate is sufficient for activation of RIG-I (preference for 300–1000 bp) and MDA5 (preference for >1000 bp) and that negative strand RNA viruses that do not contain dsRNA molecules in their replication cycle (such as influenza) are detected by RIG-I via ssRNA containing a 5′-triphosphate.

With regard to the conclusions drawn from this work, several points must be noted: (i) RNase III-cleaved polyI:C besides monophosphate contains diphosphate ends, due to ribonucleotidediphosphates used for enzymatic generation. (ii) The only synthetic dsRNA used in this work was 70 bp long, and it induced 25 pg/ml IFN-β in MEFs, which is 50-fold lower compared with in vitro-transcribed and capped 400-bp dsRNA, and thus is close to background. (iii) Due to technical reasons, in vitro-transcribed capped RNA used may not be completely capped. (iv) RIG-I had a substantial contribution (30%) to the activity of capped in vitro-transcribed dsRNA of
4 kb, leaving the question of why EMCV is not partially detected by RIG-I in vivo unanswered.

### Contribution of length, end formation, and monophosphate?

According to the above results, the RIG-I activity of non-triphosphate-containing dsRNA shorter than 70 bp is expected to be marginal or absent. However, in an earlier study, Marques et al. (36) suggested that dsRNA of 25 or 27 nucleotides without a 3′-or 5′-overhang (blunt ends) activate RIG-I, while the same dsRNA oligonucleotides with two nucleotides 3′-overhang were inactive. Fully synthetic RNA molecules were used, except one in vitro-transcribed RNA that was used as positive control. Unlike the studies by Kato et al. (14) this work was performed in the glioblastoma cell line T98G, which is known to be highly sensitive to the activation of the IFN system. The same type of activity was confirmed in MRC-5 cells (normal human fibroblasts) but was not found in HeLa cells or 293T cells. HT1080 cells only responded when they were primed with IFN. RIG-I-dependent activity was confirmed by RIG-I over-expression of 293T and siRNA against RIG-I.

As expected, in the work by Marques et al. (36), no difference between blunt end and 3′-overhang was seen in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, as in this system it is known that PDCs are activated via TLR7, and TLR7 is activated by both blunt-end and 3′-overhang short dsRNA. However, at the same time, this observation also nicely demonstrates that IFN-α induction in myeloid dendritic cells and monocytes within peripheral blood mononuclear cells is minimal or absent, suggesting that the activation of RIG-I by blunt-end dsRNA without 5′-triphosphate is quite ineffective under physiological circumstances. In these experiments with peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 5′-triphosphate RNA was not shown as a positive control; however, it is well known that 5′-triphosphate RNA induces high amounts of IFN-α in peripheral blood mononuclear cells independently of TLR7 and PDCs (32). Marques et al. (36), go on to show that both 3′-overhang dsRNA and blunt-end dsRNA equally bind to RIG-I but that unwinding is inhibited by 3′-overhangs; furthermore, unwinding is associated with adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity and with the magnitude of the induction of the IFN response gene p56. The authors speculate that 3′-overhang dsRNA as generated by dicer cleavage does not induce type I IFN but preferentially associates with the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), while blunt-end dsRNA molecules signal the presence of viral RNA and induce type I IFN but are not taken up into the RISC. Interestingly, in their study, all dsRNA molecules tested (19–27-mer with 2 nt 3′-overhang or blunt end) activate PKR. This finding is surprising, as a number of studies reported that PKR activation requires dsRNA longer than 30 bp (10, 42, 43).

By contrast, Takahasi et al. (44) found that 25-mer blunt-end dsRNA has no type I IFN-inducing activity, as determined by a luciferase assay based on virus-responsive reporter p-55C1Bluc. However, IFN-inducing activity was found for 5′-monophosphate RNA (generated by T4 polynucleotide kinase) but only if RNA was double stranded and had one or two blunt ends carrying a 5′-monophosphate. A 3′-monophosphate 25-mer dsRNA with a 2 nt 3′-overhang at the monophosphate end was also active. A 3′-overhang of 5 or 22 nt at the 5′-monophosphate end but without overhangs at the opposite end of the RNA (22 nt 5′-overhang) abolished the activity. Unlike for 5′-monophosphate, a 25-mer ssRNA was sufficient if a 5′-triphosphate was present (RNA generated by in vitro transcription). Activity and RIG-I dependency was confirmed in MEFs based on IRF3 dimerization but, notably, not based on IFN-α or IFN-β protein production, an established robust read-out for type I IFN-inducing activity in MEFs.

In Takahasi’s work (44), ssRNA with 5′-triphosphate and dsRNA, irrespectively of the presence of a monophosphate, were found to bind to RIG-I protein. However, compared with the study by Marques et al. (36), Takahasi et al. (44) obtained the opposite results with regard to unwinding of RNA molecules. Unwinding required a 3′-overhang of 5 nt or 15 nt, while blunt-end or 5′-overhang dsRNA were not unwound by RIG-I. Unwinding required ATP hydrolysis. Unlike in the work by Marques et al. (36), these results suggested that helicase activity is reversibly related to IFN induction. Interestingly, binding sites for dsRNA and 5′-triphosphate ssRNA were found to overlap, and the presence of a monophosphate had no impact on binding or unwinding, leaving the question why monophosphate is required for type I IFN-inducing activity unanswered.

### Molecular interaction of RIG-I and its ligand

RIG-I, together with MDA5 and LGP2, belong to the superfamily 2 (SF2) helicases or ATPases (45, 46). These enzymes share seven conserved sequence motifs (referred to as ‘helicase motifs’) that mediate ATP and nucleic acid binding. ATP hydrolysis is typically stimulated by nucleic acid binding and results in a conformational powerstroke. SF2 helicases/ATPases can have diverse mechanistic functions, including separation of nucleic acid duplexes for bona fide helicases, translocation and motor function, or remodeling of nucleic acid structures or protein-nucleic acid complexes. Among SF2 ATPases, RIG-I,
MDA5, and LGP2 possess a unique domain structure. RIG-I and MDA5 consist of two N-terminal CARDs, a central SF2 type DECH box ATPase domain and a C-terminal extension of little sequence homology to other proteins.

Mutations in the ATP-binding site or truncation of parts of the DECH box domain abolish RIG-I activity, suggesting that both ATP- and nucleic acid substrate-dependent conformational changes are a central part of viral RNA sensing (11, 32). Recent results have shown that the C-terminal domain is required for RIG-I activity and that over-expression of the C-terminal domain inhibits RIG-I signaling in response to SV infections (28). Based on these findings, current models suggest that viral substrates induce an ATP-dependent conformational change that damasks the N-terminal CARDs for interaction with IPS-1.

Cui et al. (47) provided evidence that the C-terminal regulatory domain (RD) of RIG-I acts as a sensor for the 5′-triphosphate moiety of 5′-triphosphate RNA and that binding leads to the activation of the RIG-I ATPase by RNA-dependent dimerization. The crystal structure of RD revealed a zinc-binding domain that is structurally related to guanosine diphosphate (GDP)/guanosine triphosphate (GTP) exchange factors of Rab-like guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases). The zinc coordination site turned out to be essential for RIG-I signaling and is also conserved in MDA5 and LGP2, suggesting related RD domains in all three enzymes. Structure-guided mutagenesis identified a conserved lysine at the bottom of a positively charged groove of the RD domain as the likely recognition motif for 5′-triphosphates in RNA (47). While folding and zinc coordination site are conserved, the lysine and other features of the recognition groove are different in LGP2 and MDA5, suggesting that RD is a specificity determinant for different viral ligands. The authors compared in vitro-transcribed 5′-triphosphate-containing rabies virus leader RNA 58-mer (pppRVL) and 50-mers of non-phosphorylated synthetic ssRNA or dsRNA, corresponding to the sequence of the first 50 bases of RVL, for their ability to stimulate the ATPase activity of RIG-I and RIG-I variants in vitro. The authors found that synthetic dsRNA activated ATPase activity but that the catalytic activity was much higher with 5′-triphosphate RNA; furthermore, the CARDs appeared to inhibit or even block the activation of RIG-I by non-modified dsRNA. Based on their findings, Cui et al. (47) conclude a dual mechanistic role for RD: first, a recognition domain for 5′-triphosphates in RNA, and second, triggering a structural switch that dimerizes RIG-I. They reason that such a dual role would also provide an explanation for the observation that RD is not only involved in RIG-I activation by pppRVL but also by dsRNA in vitro. For

instance, if the ATPase activity is stimulated by dimer formation, a lack of dimer formation in RIG-I-RD constructs could reduce ATPase activity for all types of RNA, including dsRNA.

The concept that the triphosphate end of 5′-triphosphate RNA anchors the RNA within charged residues of the RIG-I-RD in a way that it causes a conformation change to displace the RD and release signaling autorepression is supported by Takahasi et al. and Saito et al. (44, 48). Furthermore, for the interaction of RIG-I and polyI:C, Takahasi proposed a model in which polyI:C binds to RIG-I but that RIG-I upon binding of polyI:C acquires a conformation that inhibits IFN-signaling.

### Does sequence matter?

In a recent publication, Saito et al. (48) proposed that the RIG-I activity of viral ssRNA is determined by the presence of U- or A-rich 3′-sequences that can be hundreds of bases apart from the 5′-triphosphate end. In this work, the ability of the hepatitis C virus (HCV) genome RNA or contiguous subgenomic segments to trigger the IFN-β promoter in human Huh7 cells was examined. The main signaling activity was allocated to the RNA sequence 9389–9619 encoding the 3′-non-translated region (NTR). Based on the activity of shorter subfragments of this sequence, 100-nucleotide poly-U/UC region (containing 78% uridine and 22% ribocytosine) of the HCV genome and replication intermediate RNA was defined as molecular pattern recognized by RIG-I. Similar to poly-U/UC, poly-U/UG and a 100 nt poly-A RNA, but neither poly-C nor poly-G RNA, triggered signaling to the IFN-β promoter. In their work, RNA must contain 5′-triphosphate for RIG-I signaling, and 5′-triphosphate was necessary but not sufficient for optimal binding of RNA to RIG-I. Further analysis of different negative strand RNA viral genomes known to activate RIG-I (rabies, VSV, SV, influenza, measles, and Ebola) lead the authors to conclude that homopolyuridine or homopolyriboadenine motifs present in the genomes of RNA viruses are the molecular signature within 5′-triphosphate RNA that is efficiently recognized by RIG-I to trigger the immune response. Of note, highly structured RNA regions of the HCV RNA containing dsRNA were not potent RIG-I ligands, again supporting the view that ssRNA carrying a 5′-triphosphate is sufficient for full RIG-I ligand activity. Interestingly, in the work by Saito et al. (48), three other published 5′-triphosphate RNA molecules, pppT3-63, Tri-GFP, and EGFP 2 T7 (32, 35, 47), previously described as RIG-I substrates and comprising 50% or fewer A/U nucleotides, induced weaker signaling to the IFN-β promoter compared with the poly-U/UC RNA. Another study supports the view that the RNA sequence contributes to RIG-I
activity of 5′-triphosphate RNA. Gondai et al. (49) made the observation that the introduction of increasing numbers of guanosines at the 5′-end of in vitro-transcribed short-hairpin RNA reduces the IFN induction by short-hairpin RNA.

### Role of 5′-triphosphate for the activation of PKR?

Nallagatla et al. (50) suggested that 5′-triphosphate is involved in the recognition of RNA by PKR. It is well established that PKR becomes activated through autophosphorylation in the presence of viral dsRNA similar to other dsRNA-binding proteins, such as RNA-specific adenosine deaminases (ADARs), dicer, and ribonuclease III (51). Interaction with dsRNA is usually sequence independent (10, 52), and in the case of PKR, at least 16 bp of dsRNA inhibit and more than 33 bp promote PKR activation (10, 53). PKR dsRNA binding results in phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2a (eIF2a) and translation inhibition. In this more recent work, the authors report their surprising finding that 5′-triphosphate RNA with very limited secondary structures (no double strand) can activate PKR in a 5′-triphosphate-dependent fashion in vitro and in vivo. The authors state that ‘activation of PKR by 5′-triphosphate RNA was independent of RIG-I’ and was enhanced by treatment with type I IFN (IFN-α). It was suggested that similar to RIG-I, surveillance of molecular features at the 5′-end of transcripts by PKR presents a means of allowing pathogenic RNA to be distinguished from self-RNA. Concluding from their data, the authors state that ‘activation of PKR by 5′-triphosphate ssRNA may use an alternative mechanism of activation that may require functional RIG-I signaling and/or IFN-α/β production’, which somewhat contradicts the above citation of the same authors. Therefore, the functional interaction of PKR and RIG-I with regard to 5′-triphosphate recognition seems unresolved.

### In vitro transcription: do we get what we expect?

Most studies agree on the fact that single-stranded 5′-triphosphate RNA is sufficient to bind to and activate RIG-I (31, 32, 34, 44, 47, 48). This conclusion is based on the assumption that the protocols used to generate in vitro-transcribed ssRNA indeed generate the desired type of RNA. However, it is well known in the field that during in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase, self-coded 3′-extension of run-off transcripts produce aberrant products including size-variable extensions with complementarity to the correct transcript (54, 55). All reports on RIG-I-RNA interaction, including our own previous work, except the work by Saito et al. (48) have used

in vitro transcription to generate 5′-triphosphate RNA without analyzing the purity and identity of those RNA molecules (31, 32, 34, 44, 47). Only Saito et al. (48) provide a rather limited gel analysis of few selected in vitro-transcribed RNA molecules. Analysis of RNA is specifically relevant to their work, as the efficacy of the in vitro transcription process and the generation of unexpected dsRNA was demonstrated to depend on the 3′-sequence (55).

#### Concluding remarks

It was reported that dsRNA is not only present in dsRNA viruses but also substantial amounts of cytosolic dsRNA are produced during the replicative life cycle of positive ssRNA viruses (56). In agreement with the concept that dsRNA is sufficient for RIG-I recognition, double-stranded and positive ssRNA viruses (generating dsRNA during replication) indeed were described to be detected by RIG-I (14, 33). Conversely, ssRNA only activates RIG-I if it carries a 5′-triphosphate end (31, 32, 34). This is supported by the fact that most negative ssRNA viruses (14, 33) contain a 5′-triphosphate but not dsRNA, as determined by dsRNA binding antibodies (34, 56), and furthermore by the observation that hanta virus, which carries a 5′-monophosphate, does not stimulate RIG-I (30). Based on the current evidence for dsRNA and 5′-triphosphate ssRNA recognition by RIG-I, it is very likely that these two types of RNA molecules represent two distinct ligands which are detected by the same receptor RIG-I. However, it is unclear whether both types of RNA are equally potent RIG-I ligands.

An additional level of complexity comes from the results on sequence contribution to RIG-I ligand activity (49, 57) and on blunt-end and 5′-monophosphate RNA (36, 44) (Table 1). Only a head-to-head analysis will provide definite information about potency and specificity of different RIG-I ligands proposed in the literature. Such an analysis will have to use molecularly defined RNA molecules and address the issues of delivery and stability, a dose-response, the maximum level of activity, and different cellular and molecular RIG-I read-outs. Such an analysis will be important for the selection and development of most powerful RIG-I ligands for therapeutic purposes.

There is an intriguing example demonstrating that the use of well-defined RNA molecules is crucial for the sound analysis of RNA functions. In the seminal work on RNA interference by Fire and Mello (58), only the use of gel-purified RNA finally provided the evidence that sense RNA does not support gene silencing. This finding came after years of confusion

about the surprising observation that not only in vitro-transcribed anti-sense strand but also sense strand mediated gene silencing. It turned out that the RNA preparation of sense strand generated by in vitro transcription unexpectedly contained considerable amounts of anti-sense strand, due to

RNA-dependent RNA polymerization, and if the sense strand was purified, the unexpected silencing of sense strand expression disappeared. Disappearance of multiple RIG-I ligands is the expectation we have if purified RNA is used to pinpoint the exact RIG-I ligand, which may still await identification.
