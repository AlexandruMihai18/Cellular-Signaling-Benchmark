Mutation in Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) is a cause of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). Mutant SOD1 protein (SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$) induces motor neuron death, although the molecular mechanism of SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$-induced cell death remains controversial. Here we show that SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$ specifically interacted with Derlin-1, a component of endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated degradation (ERAD) machinery and triggered ER stress through dysfunction of ERAD. SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$-induced ER stress activated the apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-dependent cell death pathway. Perturbation of binding between SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$ and Derlin-1 by Derlin-1-derived oligopeptide suppressed SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$-induced ER stress, ASK1 activation, and motor neuron death. Moreover, deletion of ASK1 mitigated the motor neuron loss and extended the life span of SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$ transgenic mice. These findings demonstrate that ER stress-induced ASK1 activation, which is triggered by the specific interaction of Derlin-1 with SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$, is crucial for disease progression of familial ALS.

Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is the most frequent adult-onset motor neuron disease and is characterized by selective loss of motor neurons. Familial ALS-linked mutations of Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD1) induce motor neuron death. Previous studies have suggested that SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$ causes various cellular events, including alteration of gene expression (Yoshihara et al. 2002; Kirby et al. 2005), abnormal protein interactions (Kunst et al. 1997), activation of caspases (Pasinelli et al. 1998; Li et al. 2000), dysfunction of mitochondria (Bowler et al. 1993; Wong et al. 1995; Liu et al. 2004), and cytoskeletal abnormalities (Julien and Beaulieu 2000). However, the causal relationship between these events and motor neuron death remains unclear.

Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is triggered by the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen and has recently been implicated in various neurodegenerative diseases (Sekine et al. 2006). Recent studies have suggested that ER stress signaling is also involved in the pathogenesis of ALS (Tobisawa et al. 2003; Atkin et al. 2006; Kikuchi et al. 2006). We showed previously that, upon ER stress, an ER-resident type I transmembrane serine/threonine kinase termed IRE1 recruits TRAF2 and ASK1 (apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1) on the ER membrane and thus activates the ASK1-dependent apoptosis pathway (Nishitoh et al. 2002). Several groups have reported that activation of the ASK1 cascade is associated with induction of motor neuron death by SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$ both in vitro (Raoul et al. 2002) and in vivo (Wengenack et al. 2004; Holasek et al. 2005; Vegliane et al. 2006). These observations suggested that a functional link between ER stress and ASK1 may exist in the process of SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$-induced motor neuron death. However, the molecular mechanism by which SOD1${}^{\text{mut}}$

induces ER stress has remained unclear. Furthermore, genetic evidence has not been provided regarding the hypothetical involvement of ER stress-ASK1 pathway in SOD1mut-induced motor neuron death. In the present study, we investigated the molecular mechanism of SOD1mut-induced ER stress and the role of ER stress-induced ASK1 activation in the pathogenesis of ALS.

## Results

### $SOD1^{mut}$ triggers ER stress

To investigate the causal relationship between $SOD1^{mut}$ and ER stress-dependent motor neuron death, we first examined whether $SOD1^{mut}$ induces ER stress in NSC34 motor neurons, as assessed by band-shift analyses of the ER transmembrane kinase receptors IRE1 and PERK. Adenovirus (Ad)-mediated expression of ALS-linked $SOD1^{mut}$ ($SOD1^{G93A}$) was detectable within 48 h of infection (Supplemental Fig. S1A). $SOD1^{mut}$ ($SOD1^{A4V}$, $SOD1^{G85R}$, and $SOD1^{G93A}$) but not wild-type $SOD1$ ($SOD1^{wt}$) activated IRE1 and PERK (Fig. 1A; Supplemental Fig. S1A). To confirm the activation of IRE1 by $SOD1^{mut}$, we examined Xbp-1 mRNA splicing by RT-PCR. We clearly observed the appearance of spliced Xbp-1 mRNA by $SOD1^{mut}$ but not $SOD1^{wt}$ in HEK293 cells (Supplemental Fig. S1B) and NSC34 cells (Fig. 4D, lanes 2–5, below). $SOD1^{mut}$-specific induction of CHOP and BiP (ER stress marker proteins) was also observed (Fig. 1B). These findings suggested that accumulation of various $SOD1^{mut}$ proteins commonly induce ER stress.

Inhibition of proteasome activity has been reported to be induced by $SOD1^{mut}$ in Neuro2a cells (Urushitani et al. 2002). Since polyglutamine (polyQ) fragments have been shown to induce ER stress through inhibition of proteasome activity (Nishitoh et al. 2002), $SOD1^{mut}$ might also induce ER stress through proteasomal dysfunction. We therefore examined whether alteration of proteasome activity was involved in $SOD1^{mut}$-induced ER stress. Proteasome activity was inhibited by treatment with lactacystin, a proteasome inhibitor, but not by Ad-mediated expression of $SOD1^{mut}$ in NSC34 cells within 48 h (Supplemental Fig. S2A). These findings suggested that a mechanism other than proteasomal dysfunction may be involved in $SOD1^{mut}$-induced ER stress in NSC34 cells.

### $SOD1^{mut}$ inhibits ERAD

Restoration of ER homeostasis is achieved mainly by two independent mechanisms, chaperone-dependent refolding and ER-associated degradation (ERAD). In ERAD, misfolded proteins are exported from the ER back into the cytosol and are rapidly degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) (Kopito 1997; Tsai et al. 2002; Meusser et al. 2005). Blocking of the refolding mechanism and/or the ERAD mechanism induces accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen and thus ER stress. Since $SOD1^{mut}$ clearly induced expression of

(A) NSC34 cells were lysed after infection with Ad-$SOD1^{wt}$, Ad-$SOD1^{A4V}$, Ad-$SOD1^{G85R}$, or Ad-$SOD1^{G93A}$ for 48 h or treatment with 2.5 μg/mL tunicamycin (a potent inducer of ER stress) for 2 h and analyzed by immunoprecipitation-immunoblotting (IP-IB) with antibodies to IRE1α or PERK.

Expression of BiP and CHOP was examined by RT–PCR. (C) NSC34 cells were transfected with NHK and $SOD1^{wt}$ or $SOD1^{mut}$. Cells were pulse-labeled with $[^{35}S]$ methionine and cysteine and chased for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to α1AT. (NHK + CHO) Glycosylated NHK; (NHK – CHO) deglycosylated NHK. The relative radioactivities in NHK at different times of chase were calculated and are shown as fold decreases relative to the intensity observed at 0 h chase. (D) NSC34 cells were transfected with VenusU and $SOD1^{wt}$ or $SOD1^{mut}$. Cells were pulse-labeled with $[^{35}S]$ methionine and cysteine and chased for the indicated time periods. Cell lysates were immunoprecipitated with antibody to GFP. The relative radioactivities in VenusU at different times of chase were calculated and are shown as fold decreases relative to the intensity observed at 0 h chase.

the ER-resident chaperone BiP (Fig. 1B), the productive refolding mechanism appears not to be inhibited by SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. To examine whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> interferes with the ERAD mechanism, we examined the stability of the null Hong Kong (NHK) mutant protein of α1-antitrypsin (α1AT), an ER luminal misfolded protein (Sifers et al. 1988). Pulse-chase experiments showed that NHK was degraded with a half-life of <8 h in NSC34 cells transfected with or without SOD1<sup>wt</sup> (Fig. 1C; Supplemental Fig. S3A). In contrast, overexpression of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> decreased the degradation of NHK to a half-life of >8 h (Fig. 1C). To confirm the interference with the degradation of the other ERAD substrate by SOD1<sup>mut</sup>, we examined the stability of CD3δ, a well-characterized transmembrane-type ERAD substrate (Fang et al. 2001). Cycloheximide chase experiments showed that the degradation of CD3δ was also retarded by overexpression of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Supplemental Fig. S3C). To further examine whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> also interferes with the degradation of cytosolic protein, we examined the stability of the unstable Venus mutant protein (Venus<sup>U</sup>), a cytosolic proteasome substrate. There was no difference between a half-life of Venus<sup>U</sup> in SOD1<sup>wt</sup> transfected cells and that in SOD1<sup>mut</sup> transfected cells (Fig. 1D). These findings suggested that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> specifically impairs ERAD function but not cytosolic protein degradation in motor neurons. Furthermore, SOD1<sup>mut</sup> clearly delayed the deglycosylation of NHK in addition to degradation (see the band shift of NHK; Fig. 1C). Previous studies have reported that the cytoplasmic peptide N-glycanase contributes to deglycosylation of misfolded glycoproteins prior to degradation (Suzuki et al. 2002). Thus, the delay of the deglycosylation of NHK suggested that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> delays retro-translocation from ER lumen to the cytosol.

Mutant SOD1-induced motor neuron death

between exogenous SOD1<sup>mut</sup> and endogenous Derlin-1 was also observed in NSC34 cells (Fig. 2C). These findings suggested that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> proteins specifically interact with Derlin-1 in mammalian cells.

To confirm these results in more physiological conditions, we examined the association of endogenous Derlin-1 and SOD1 in spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> gene transgenic (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>) mice. SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice showed the onset of motor function loss, which was measured using rota-rod test, at a mean age of 28.1 ± 1.3 wk, and died at a mean age of 34.9 ± 1.6 wk (see below and Fig. 5G). Accumulation of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> was observed in the spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice at the post-onset stage and the end stage (Fig. 2D). A strong interaction of endogenous Derlin-1 with exogenous SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, but not with exogenous SOD1<sup>wt</sup> (Supplemental Fig. S8A), was observed in parallel with accumulation of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Fig. 2D).

The reported expression pattern of Derlin-1 in mouse organs is controversial (Lilley and Ploegh 2005; Oda et al. 2006). We thus examined whether Derlin-1 is expressed in neuronal tissues of SOD1<sup>wt</sup> and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice by immunoblotting analysis using a newly developed Derlin-1-specific antibody (Supplemental Fig. S4A). Derlin-1 proteins were clearly observed in many organs, including cerebral cortex, cerebellum, medulla, and spinal cord (Fig. 2E). Since human SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> gene is driven by human SOD1 promoter, SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> was widely expressed as expected in SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse tissues (Fig. 2E; Epstein et al. 1987; Gurney et al. 1994). We also found that expression of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> in neuronal tissues and liver was higher than that in other organs and that the interaction of Derlin-1 with SOD1<sup>mut</sup>, but not SOD1<sup>wt</sup>, was observed specifically in these tissues (Fig. 2E). The regionally specific interaction of Derlin-1 with SOD1<sup>mut</sup> might thus be one of the reasons why SOD1<sup>mut</sup> specifically targets neuronal tissues.

SOD1<sup>mut</sup> interacts specifically with Derlin-1

Since inhibition of the UPS is unlikely to be essential for SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress (Fig. 1D; Supplemental Fig. S2A), disturbance of the retro-translocation system from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm may be a potential target of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. Various proteins involved in ERAD have been identified recently (Meusser et al. 2005). Among them, components of the retro-translocation machinery including ATPase p97, its cofactors Ufd1 and Npl4, and the ER membrane proteins Derlin-1 and VIMP are of key importance to ERAD function (Lilley and Ploegh 2004; Ye et al. 2004). We therefore examined the in vitro interactions of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> with p97, Ufd1, Npl4, VIMP, and Derlin-1. In vitro-translated <sup>35</sup>S-labeled Derlin-1, but not p97, Ufd1, Npl4, or VIMP, bound specifically to recombinant His-tagged SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (Fig. 2A). To examine the interaction of Derlin-1 with different mutant forms of SOD1, several SOD1 mutants, including the A4V, G85R, and G93A mutants, SOD1<sup>A4V</sup>, SOD1<sup>G85R</sup>, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, but not SOD1<sup>wt</sup>, were clearly coimmunoprecipitated with Derlin-1 (Fig. 2B). The remaining ERAD components, including p97, Npl4, Ufd1, and VIMP, were not coimmunoprecipitated with SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (data not shown). The specific interaction

SOD1<sup>mut</sup> interacts with the C-terminal cytoplasmic region of Derlin-1

Although SOD1<sup>mut</sup> itself has neither a signal sequence nor transmembrane segment and is located mainly in the cytosol, it has been reported that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> accumulates in the ER (Kikuchi et al. 2006; Urushitani et al. 2006). We therefore examined whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> resides in the ER lumen or associates with the cytosolic side of the ER membrane. Purified microsomal fraction enriched in the ER membrane was isolated from the spinal cord of a SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mouse. We found that SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> exists mainly in the cytosolic fraction and some in the microsomal fraction (Fig. 2F). The alkaline extraction clearly released SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, but not Derlin-1, from the microsome, as seen for p97, which is known to be peripherally associated with the ER membrane (Fig. 2F). These findings indicated that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> exists mainly in the cytosol, and some fraction of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> attaches to the cytosolic surface of the ER.

Derlin-1 contains a domain named for yeast Derlp (Derl-like domain) and is a protein that spans the ER membrane four times, with both its N and C termini

facing the cytosol (Fig. 2G; Lilley and Ploegh 2004; Ye et al. 2004). To determine the domain of interaction, we constructed expression plasmids for a C-terminally truncated Derlin-1 protein [Derlin-1(ΔC)], which exhibited a reticular pattern, typical of ER localization, and for a C-terminal fragment of Derlin-1 [Derlin-1(CT1)], which exhibited cytosolic localization (Fig. 2H). Derlin-1(CT1), but not Derlin-1(ΔC), coimmunoprecipitated with SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Fig. 2I), indicating that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> associates with the C-terminal cytosolic region of Derlin-1. To further investigate the region of interaction of Derlin-1(CT1) with SOD1<sup>mut</sup>, various truncation mutants of the C-terminal fragment of Derlin-1 were assessed for interaction with SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. Derlin-1(CT1), Derlin-1(CT2), Derlin-1(CT3), and Derlin-1(CT4), but not Derlin-1(CT5) and Derlin-1(CT6), were coimmunoprecipitated with SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Fig. 2J), indicating that Derlin-1(CT4), composed of 12 amino acids (FLYRWLPSRRGG), is minimally required and sufficient for interaction with SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. Mammals also express two additional Derl-like homologs to Derlin-1, designated Derlin-2 and Derlin-3 (Oda et al. 2006). To examine whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> also interacts with other Derlin family proteins, C-terminal fragments of Derlin-2 and Derlin-3 [Derlin-2(CT) and Derlin-3(CT), respectively] were assessed for interaction with SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. Derlin-2(CT) and Derlin-3(CT) were not coimmunoprecipitated with SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Fig. 2K), suggesting that, among the Derlin family proteins, SOD1<sup>mut</sup> associates specifically with Derlin-1. Moreover, since mRNA expression of Derlin-1 was more abundant than that of Derlin-2 and Derlin-3 in brain (Oda et al. 2006), SOD1<sup>mut</sup> in neuronal tissues probably targets ERAD through specific binding to Derlin-1.

Mutant SOD1-induced motor neuron death

induced the interaction between NHK and Derlin-1 (Fig. 3D, top panel, lanes 2, 6–8). Furthermore, NHK was found to associate with VIMP in the presence of Derlin-1 and SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Fig. 3D, second panel, lanes 6–8), suggesting that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> induces formation of an NHK-Derlin-1-VIMP complex on the ER membrane.

The ERAD substrate that emerged into the cytosol is captured by p97, polyubiquitinated by E3 ligase, and degraded by the proteasome (Tsai et al. 2002; Meusser et al. 2005). We next examined whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> inhibits ubiquitination of NHK. Overexpression of Derlin-1 increased the amount of ubiquitinated NHK in the presence of proteasome inhibitor (MG132) (Fig. 3E, top panel, lane 3), suggesting that Derlin-1 contributes to the degradation of NHK. Expression of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> clearly decreased the amount of ubiquitinated NHK (Fig. 3E, top panel, lanes 5–7). Furthermore, SOD1<sup>mut</sup> induced accumulation of nonubiquitinated and deglycosylated NHK in addition to glycosylated NHK (Fig. 3E, second panel, lanes 5–7), suggesting that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> blocks the presentation of NHK from retro-translocon to E3 ligase. These data also suggested that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> does not inhibit the assembly of essential components of retro-translocon per se but does trap ERAD substrates on the complex composed of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-Derlin-1-VIMP and thereby inhibits subsequent transfer of ERAD substrates to the ubiquitination step by E3.

SOD1<sup>mut</sup> activates the IRE1–TRAF2–ASK1 pathway

It has been reported that the ASK1-p38 pathway is activated in motor neurons of the spinal cord of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (Wengenack et al. 2004; Holasek et al. 2005; Vellianese et al. 2006). To investigate the role of ASK1 in the motor neurotoxicity by SOD1<sup>mut</sup>, we examined whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> activates ASK1 as assessed by in vitro kinase assay. Expression of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>, but not SOD1<sup>wt</sup>, activated endogenous ASK1 (Fig. 4A, top panel). We next examined whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ASK1 activation is mediated by ER stress. Activated IRE1 has been demonstrated to recruit TRAF2 and ASK1 on the ER membrane and thus to activate ASK1 (Nishitoh et al. 2002). We examined whether SOD1<sup>mut</sup> induces interaction between endogenous ASK1 and TRAF2. ASK1 was found to associate with TRAF2 in NSC34 cells infected with Ad-SOD1<sup>mut</sup> but not those infected with Ad-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> (Fig. 4A, third panel). To further examine whether IRE1 recruits TRAF2 and ASK1 in SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-expressing cells, Ad-SOD1, Ad-ASK1, Ad-IRE1, and Lentivirus encoding (Len)-TRAF2 were infected into NSC34 cells and subjected to coimmunoprecipitation analysis. ASK1 was found to associate with IRE1 only in the presence of TRAF2 and SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Fig. 4B), suggesting that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> induces formation of an IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1 complex on the ER membrane and thus activates ASK1 by triggering ER stress-induced IRE1 activation.

We next assessed the requirement of Derlin-1 for SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress and ASK1 activation using siRNA against Derlin-1. Derlin-1 siRNA effectively sup-

SOD1<sup>mut</sup> attenuates the retro-translocation of ERAD substrates on the components of ERAD machinery

There are at least three models for the mechanism of how ERAD is inhibited by SOD1<sup>mut</sup>: (1) Since the C-terminal domain of Derlin-1 has been shown to be necessary for the recruitment of p97 on the ER membrane through binding with VIMP (Ye et al. 2004; Lilley and Ploegh 2005), SOD1<sup>mut</sup> might inhibit the assembly of Derlin-1, VIMP, and p97 on the ER membrane; (2) since Derlin-1 has been reported to form homo- as well as hetero-oligomers and the ERAD complex with HRD1, an ER-anchored ubiquitin E3 ligase (Lilley and Ploegh 2005; Schulze et al. 2005; Ye et al. 2005; Oda et al. 2006), SOD1<sup>mut</sup> might inhibit the interaction of Derlin-1 with these ERAD components; (3) SOD1<sup>mut</sup> might inhibit the directional flow of ERAD substrates at a certain step of their transfer from the ER lumen to p97 or E3 ligase. If the first two models were correct, overexpression of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> would inhibit the coimmunoprecipitation of Derlin-1 with VIMP, p97, or the other ERAD components. However, we could not detect any dissociation of VIMP (Fig. 3A), p97 (Fig. 3B), Derlin family proteins, and HRD1 (Fig. 3C) from Derlin-1 by SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. To test model 3, we examined the interaction of an ERAD substrate (NHK) with Derlin-1. SOD1<sup>mut</sup>, but not SOD1<sup>wt</sup>,

pressed expression of Derlin-1 without affecting that of Derlin-2, ASK1, p38, or TRAF2 (Fig. 4C,E). We examined whether reducing Derlin-1 expression levels affected the ER stress response using band-shift analyses of IRE1 and Xbp-1 mRNA splicing, which is caused by the activated RNase domain of IRE1. Derlin-1 siRNA exhibited no effect on the basal level of activation of IRE1 (Fig. 4C [lanes 1,5], D [lanes 1,7,13]) and thapsigargin-induced activation of IRE1 (Fig. 4C [lanes 4,8], D [lanes 6,12,18]), suggesting that Derlin-1 is not essential for ERAD in NSC34

cells. Interestingly, however, SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced activation of IRE1 and ASK1 was clearly inhibited by Derlin-1 depletion (Fig. 4C [lane 7], D [lanes 9–11,15–17]). Furthermore, SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced interaction between TRAF2 and ASK1 was inhibited by Derlin-1 depletion (Fig. 4E, lanes 9–11,15–17), suggesting that Derlin-1 is selectively required for the SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress. These results also suggested that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> induces ERAD dysfunction not by a simple loss of function but by a gain of malfunction of Derlin-1.

Dissociation of SOD1mut from Derlin-1 protects motor neurons from SOD1mut-induced cell death

Based on the above findings, which indicate that SOD1mut proteins induce ER stress by interacting with Derlin-1, we hypothesized that forced dissociation of SOD1mut from Derlin-1 may restore normal function of ERAD and thus suppress SOD1mut-induced motor neurotoxicity. We examined the effect of Derlin-1(CT4) on the interaction between SOD1mut and Derlin-1. When Derlin-1(CT4) but not control (Venus-HA) or Derlin-1(CT5) was coexpressed, binding of Derlin-1 to SOD1mut was strongly inhibited (Fig. 5A). Reciprocally, Derlin-1(CT4) was found to associate with SOD1mut in a dose-dependent fashion (Fig. 5A). We next examined the effect of Derlin-1(CT4) on SOD1mut-induced ER stress and ASK1 activation. Derlin-1(CT4) inhibited SOD1mut-in-

glial cells. SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced motor neuron death was significantly attenuated by coexpression of Derlin-1(CT4) (Fig. 5C,E; Supplemental Fig. S5A,B). These findings are consistent with the inhibitory effects of Derlin-1(CT4) on the binding between SOD1<sup>mut</sup> and Derlin-1 and on the ER stress-mediated activation of ASK1, and thus strongly suggested that induction of dysfunction of Derlin-1 by SOD1<sup>mut</sup> may contribute to the pathogenesis of familial ALS.

### ASK1 deficiency mitigates motor neuron death and prolongs survival of ALS mice

Finally, we examined the requirement of ASK1 for SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced motor neuron death. Spinal cord cultures derived from wild-type and ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> mice were infected with Len-SOD1<sup>wt</sup> or Len-SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>. ASK1 deficiency did not affect the expression of SOD1<sup>wt</sup> or SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> (Supplemental Fig. S6). ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> neurons were significantly more resistant to SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced cell death than were wild-type neurons (Fig. 5D,E). Inhibition of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced cell death in ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> neurons was not significantly enhanced by the expression of Derlin-1(CT4) (Supplemental Fig. S7), suggesting that the ASK1-dependent signal may serve as a major cell death pathway in the downstream SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress. To further evaluate the role of ASK1 in the pathogenesis of ALS in vivo, we tested whether ASK1 deficiency ameliorates the motor neuropathological alterations in ALS mice. We produced SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice that lacked ASK1 (SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> mice) (Supplemental Fig. S8B) and compared their time of disease onset and lifespan with those of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice. Time of disease onset was determined as that of loss of motor function. On rota-rod testing, no significant difference was found between SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. 5G). However, the mean survival of SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> mice was 38.4 ± 2.7 wk (±SEM) and significantly longer than the 34.9 ± 1.6 wk survival of control SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (long rank = 17.0206, P < 0.0001) (Fig. 5G). We also examined the time of disease onset and lifespan using SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> high copy [SOD1<sup>G93A(high)</sup>] mice. ASK1 deficiency also extended the survival of SOD1<sup>G93A(high)</sup> mice but not the time of onset (Supplemental Fig. S9). These findings indicated that ASK1 deficiency extends the survival of ALS mice by ameliorating disease progression. To assess the role of ASK1 in spinal motor neuron death in vivo, we examined L3, L4, and L5 spinal sections from wild-type, ASK1<sup>−/−</sup>, SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>, and SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> mice. At the end stage, SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice exhibited fewer motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord than age-matched wild-type or ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> mice (Fig. 5H; Supplemental Fig. S10A). In contrast, a larger number of motor neurons were significantly found in the upper (L3 and L4) spinal cord from SOD1<sup>G93A</sup>/ASK1<sup>−/−</sup> than in that from SOD1<sup>G93A</sup> mice (Fig. 5H,I; Supplemental Fig. S10A,B). These findings indicated that the absence of ASK1 mitigates motor neuron death in ALS mice.

Mutant SOD1-induced motor neuron death

#### Discussion

A novel pathogenic mechanism of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-mediated ALS is supported by the findings that SOD1<sup>mut</sup> interacts specifically with Derlin-1 and that this interaction impairs ERAD and leads to ER stress-dependent activation of ASK1 (Fig. 6). The nearly complete loss of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress and activation of ASK1 by reduced expression of Derlin-1 or by overexpression of Derlin-1(CT4) strongly suggests that the binding between SOD1<sup>mut</sup> and Derlin-1 is an important step in the SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress signaling pathway. It has been reported that translocon-associated protein (TRAP) δ interacts with SOD1<sup>mut</sup> (Kunst et al. 1997) and that TRAP complex including TRAPδ is required for ERAD (Nagasawa et al. 2007), suggesting that the association of SOD1<sup>mut</sup> with TRAPδ may also be involved in SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced ER stress.

It is unclear how various SOD1<sup>mut</sup> proteins interact with Derlin-1. SOD1<sup>L126Z</sup>, a simple C-terminal deletion mutant (Supplemental Fig. S11A), which causes motor neuron disease in mice (Wang et al. 2005), also interacted with Derlin-1 (Supplemental Fig. S11B). Therefore, the Derlin-1 interaction domain of SOD1<sup>w</sup>t might be concealed by proper folding and be bared by mutation-dependent unfolding of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>. Another hypothesis is that chaperon proteins might mediate the interaction between SOD1<sup>mut</sup> and Derlin-1. Although the results from our in vitro studies using recombinant SOD1 proteins

![Figure 6](#fig6)

**Figure 6.** Schematic representation of the mechanism of SOD1<sup>mut</sup>-induced motor neuron death through ER stress. See the text for details.

support a direct interaction between SOD1^mut^ and Derlin-1 (Fig. 2A), we cannot rule out the possibility that chaperon proteins in the reticulocyte lysate mediate the interaction between SOD1^mut^ and Derlin-1. SOD1^mut^, but not SOD1^wt^, is known to interact with heat shock proteins, including Hsp25 and Hsp/Hsc70 (Shinder et al. 2001; Wang et al. 2003; Urushitani et al. 2004).

It is still unclear how the association of SOD1^mut^ with Derlin-1 inhibits the ERAD pathway. Derlin-1 is one of the components required for retro-translocation of misfolded proteins from the ER lumen to the cytoplasm (Lilley and Ploegh 2004; Ye et al. 2004). Derlin-1-mediated retro-translocation is currently believed to occur as follows (Meusser et al. 2005): (1) The substrate is recognized by ER chaperones or ER membrane receptors and is targeted to a retro-translocon; (2) Derlin-1 recruits a membrane complex containing VIMP, the p97 complex, and an E3 ligase; (3) once the substrate emerges into the cytosol, it is captured by p97 as a result of its AAA-ATPase activity and polyubiquitinated by E3; and (4) subsequently, the polyubiquitinated substrates are degraded by the proteasome. The present finding that inhibition of proteasomal activity was undetectable by SOD1^mut^ at the time at which SOD1^mut^-induced ER stress was evoked (Fig. 1D; Supplemental Fig. S2A) suggests that it is unlikely that SOD1^mut^ primarily targeted final step 4. If SOD1^mut^ disturbs the initiation step 1 of retro-translocation, SOD1^mut^ may inhibit interaction between the unfolded substrate and Derlin-1. However, binding between NHK and Derlin-1 was clearly observed even in SOD1^mut^-overexpressing cells (Fig. 3D). Moreover, SOD1^mut^ did not inhibit association of Derlin-1 with VIMP, p97, Derlin family proteins, and HRD1 (Fig. 3A–C), suggesting that SOD1^mut^ may not perturb step 2. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that SOD1^mut^ inhibits additional interactions between Derlin-1 and its partners in the ERAD complex. Since ubiquitination of ERAD substrate was inhibited by SOD1^mut^ (Fig. 3E), SOD1^mut^ may thus disturb the presentation of ERAD substrate to the p97 complex or E3. Although exactly how SOD1^mut^ inhibits the directional flow of ERAD substrates remains to be elucidated, it is imaginable that ERAD substrates trapped on the SOD1^mut^-Derlin-1-VIMP complex would interfere with further disposal of de novo ERAD substrates like a traffic jam, eventually leading to the accumulation of misfolded proteins within the ER lumen.

Although the prolongation of survival of SOD1^G93A/ASK1^-/- mice clearly indicated the requirement of ASK1 for disease progression, ASK1 deficiency was not sufficient to attenuate disease onset (Fig. 5G; Supplemental Fig. S9). These findings are supported by a recent study that demonstrated the contribution of caspase-9 to motor neuron death and disease progression but not to disease onset in X-chromosome-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (XIAP; a mammalian inhibitor of caspase-3 and caspase-9) transgenic mice (Inoue et al. 2003). We reported previously that ASK1-induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase-9 activation (Hatai et al. 2000), suggesting that the ASK1-caspase-9 proapoptotic pathway may be crucial only for disease progression. On the other hand, several groups have reported that the p38, but not JNK, pathway is activated in motor neurons of the spinal cord of SOD1^G93A^ mice (Wengenack et al. 2004; Holasek et al. 2005; Veglianese et al. 2006). Thus, the ASK1-p38 and/or ASK1-caspase-9 pathway may specifically contribute to SOD1^mut^-induced motor neuron death.

Since expression of Derlin-1(CT4) and deletion of ASK1 only partially mitigated SOD1^mut^-induced motor neuron death in vitro (Fig. 5E; Supplemental Fig. S5B), the ER stress-ASK1 pathway-independent cell death mechanism including proteasomal dysfunction (Urushitani et al. 2002; Puttaparthi et al. 2003) may also exist in the pathogenesis of ALS. This may reflect, in part, the incomplete resistance of motor neuron death by ASK1 deficiency in ALS mice (Fig. 5I; Supplemental Fig. S10B). Furthermore, the effect of loss of ASK1 on cell death was slightly weaker than that of Derlin-1(CT4) (Fig. 5E), and Derlin-1(CT4) slightly, although not significantly, enhanced the inhibition of SOD1^mut^-induced cell death in ASK1^-/-^ neurons (Supplemental Fig. S7). These results suggest that other ER stress-induced proapoptotic pathways, including PERK (Jordan et al. 2002) and CHOP (Zinszner et al. 1998), might also be involved in the downstream SOD1^mut^-dependent motor neuron death.

Another important issue to be elucidated is the relationship between the ER stress-mediated signaling pathway and the non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of SOD1^mut^-induced neurotoxicity. Recent studies have emphasized the importance of non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (Clement et al. 2003; Boillee et al. 2006; Yamanaka et al. 2008). Consistent with their findings, SOD1^mut^ induced motor neuron death in spinal cord cultures (Fig. 5C,E; Supplemental Fig. S5A,B) but not in NSC34 cells (data not shown) in which ER stress-mediated ASK1 activation was clearly observed. However, since expression of SOD1^mut^ in neurons alone (Pramatara et al. 2001) or glial cells alone (Gong et al. 2000) does not induce motor neuron disease in mice, not only non-cell-autonomous mechanisms but also cell-autonomous mechanisms must play roles in SOD1^mut^-induced neurotoxicity. It is likely that the non-cell-autonomous signals that are transferred from astrocytes, glial cells, or feeder cells to motor neurons are coordinated with and crucial for the ER stress/ASK1-dependent cell-autonomous death signaling induced by SOD1^mut^ (Fig. 6). It is also possible that the ER stress-induced ASK1 activation itself serves as the non-cell-autonomous death signaling (Fig. 6).

In conclusion, our findings demonstrated a novel mechanism by which SOD1^mut^ causes motor neuron death through interaction with Derlin-1, ERAD dysfunction, ER stress, and ASK1 activation. Although further investigation is needed to clarify the mechanisms by which SOD1^mut^ induces the malfunction of Derlin-1 and to identify the downstream effectors of ASK1, Derlin-1 and ASK1 may be potential targets in the treatment of ALS.

Materials and methods

Band-shift analysis for IRE1 and PERK

NSC34 cells were lysed in the lysis buffer as described (Nishitoh et al. 2002). Cell extracts were clarified by centrifugation, and the supernatants were immunoprecipitated with antibodies to IRE1α and PERK. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions and immunoblotted with antibodies to IRE1α and PERK.

RT-PCR

Total RNA was isolated from \(6 \times 10^5\) NSC34 cells using ISO-GEN kit (Nippongene). Ten micrograms of RNA were reverse-transcribed with SuperScript II (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The primers used for PCR were as follows: mouse BiP, 5′-AAGGTCTATGAAGGTGAAACGACC-3′ and 5′-GACCCCAAGACATGTGAGCAACTGC-3′; mouse CHOP, 5′-ACTACTCTTGGACCCCTGCCGTCCCTAG-3′ and 5′-CATGTGCAGTGCGAGTGCAGGGTCAC-3′; mouse Xbp-1, 5′-GAACCAGGAGTTAAGAACACG-3′ and 5′-AGGCAACA GTGTCAGAGTCC-3′; and mouse G3PDH, 5′-ATGGTG AAG GTCGGTGTGAA-3′ and 5′-ACATGGGCCTCCAAGGAGTAA-3′.

Pulse-chase assay

NSC cells were labeled with \({}^{35}\) S-Promix (GE Healthcare) in medium lacking methionine and cysteine for 30 min, and chased in medium containing excess methionine and cysteine. Cells were lysed in a buffer containing 1% NP-40, 150 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), and protease inhibitor cocktail. An antibody to α1AT was used for immunoprecipitation. Immunoprecipitated samples were resolved by SDS-PAGE and analyzed by an image analyzer.

In vitro binding assay

His⁶-SOD1WT and His⁶-SOD1G93A were constructed in pTrcHis vector (Invitrogen). Recombinant His-SOD1WT and His-SOD1G93A proteins were purified with Ni-NTA (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. In vitro translated \({}^{35}\) S-labeled VCP, Ufd1, Npl4, VIMP, and Derlin-1 were prepared with the TNT Reticulocyte Lysate System (Promega). \({}^{35}\) S-labeled proteins were incubated for 16 h at 4°C with each His-SOD1WT or His-SOD1G93A in buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 0.5 mM Triton X-100; washed twice with the washing buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 0.5% Triton X-100, and 20 mM Imidazole; and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with an image analyzer.

In vivo binding assay

Binding assay using transfected HEK293 cells has been described (Nishitoh et al. 2002). For binding assay between overexpressed Flag-SOD1 and endogenous Derlin-1, ~5 × 10⁶ NSC34 cells infected with Ad-SOD1WT, Ad-SOD1A4V, Ad-SOD1G85R, or Ad-SOD1G93A for 48 h were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to Flag. For endogenous binding assay between SOD1 and Derlin-1, lysates from tissues of SOD1WT or SOD1G93A mice were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to SOD1 or control nonimmune rabbit polyclonal antibody. For endogenous binding assay between TRAF2 and ASK1, lysates from ~3 × 10⁷ NSC34 cells were immunoprecipitated with an antibody to

Mutant SOD1-induced motor neuron death

TRAF2 or control nonimmune rabbit polyclonal antibody. Proteins were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted with antibodies to Derlin-1, SOD1, ASK1, or TRAF2. Aliquots of the same lysates were subjected to immunoblotting with antibodies to Derlin-1 or Flag. For the complex formation assay of IRE1-TRAF2-ASK1, ~1 × 10⁷ NSC34 cells were infected with adenoviruses and lentivirus for 48 h, and lysates were analyzed by immunoprecipitation-immunoblot (IP-IB) as described (Nishitoh et al. 2002).

Subcellular fractionation

A 30-wk-old mouse spinal cord was washed with PBS at 4°C and placed in ice-cold homogenization buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4, 1 mM EDTA, protease inhibitors). Tissue was homogenized with 40 strokes of a glass-pestle homogenizer on ice. Homogenates were centrifuged at 14,000g for 7 min. Supernatant was centrifuged at 100,000g for 1 h to yield a microsomal pellet. Microsomes were incubated with homogenization buffer containing 100 mM Na₂CO₃ (pH 7.5 or pH 10.9) for 5 min, pelleted by centrifugation at 100,000g for 30 min, and analyzed by IB with an antibody to SOD1, Derlin-1, or p97.

In vitro kinase assay

In vitro kinase assay has been described (Nishitoh et al. 2002). In brief, infected 1 × 10⁷ NSC34 cells were lysed with the lysis buffer and immunoprecipitated with an antibody to ASK1. Kinase activity of ASK1 was measured using [γ-³²P]ATP and GST-MKK6KN or GST-SEK1KN as substrate and analyzed by SDS-PAGE with an image analyzer.

Ubiquitination assay

Lysates from transfected HEK293 cells were immunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag. After washing with the washing buffer containing 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mM EGTA, beads were boiled with the denaturing buffer containing 1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), and 5 mM EGTA. The supernatant was diluted and reimmunoprecipitated with antibody to Flag and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.

siRNA knockdown of Derlin-1

NSC34 cells were transfected with Derlin-1-specific RNAi oligo and control RNAi oligo (Invitrogen) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Invitrogen). After 24 h, cells were infected with adenovirus for 48 h. Knockdown was analyzed by IB with antibody to Derlin-1. Sequences were as follows: Derl1-MSS228692 (si1) Stealth Select RNAi, AUAUAGUUUGAAUCCAAGGAUAACCC and GGGUUAUCCUUUGGAUUUCAACUAUAU; Derl1-MSS228693 (si2) Stealth Select RNAi, AGUAA CAGGCCUUAAAUCGCGUUCC and GGAA CGCGGAUUUAA GGCCUGUUACU; and Stealth RNAi Negative Control Medium GC Duplex.

Motor neuron death assay

Spinal cords (Urushitani et al. 2002) were subjected to primary culture for 7 d and infected with lentivirus for 72 h. Cells were stained with antibody to GFAP (1:100; DAKO) and SMI 32 antibody (1:1000; Covance).

Nishitoh et al.

Mice

Both $SOD1^{G93A}$ transgenic mice (G1L/+ line, backcrossed to C57BL/6 mice; Jackson Laboratories), which expressed human $SOD1^{G93A}$ gene, and $SOD1^{wt}$ transgenic mice, which expressed >8 copies of human $SOD1^{wt}$ gene, were used. An $ASK1^{-/-}$ mouse (Tobiume et al. 2001) was mated with a $SOD1^{G93A}$ mouse under pathogen-free conditions. To circumvent potential difficulties caused by sex of mice, male mice were utilized in the present study. The onset of disease was determined by motor function deficit seen in rota-rod performance at an accelerated speed to 40 rpm for 5 min. All mouse experiments accorded with protocols approved by the Animal Research Committees of Tokyo Medical and Dental University and the University of Tokyo.

Nissl staining

Mice were perfused with PBS followed by 4% PFA in PBS. The spinal cords were excised, fixed with 4% PFA in PBS for 1 d, embedded in paraffin, and sectioned (4 μm). After being deparaffinized using standard protocols, paraffin sections were Nissl-stained with cresyl violet. All motor neuron counts were performed in a blinded fashion. We counted the numbers of motor neurons in every fifth section of L3, L4, and L5. Only the large-size neurons with a clear nucleolus and distinctly labeled cytoplasm were included in cell counts.
