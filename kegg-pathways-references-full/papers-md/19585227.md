## Abstract

**Introduction** The interaction between the immune and skeletal systems has long been acknowledged, but investigation into rheumatoid arthritis (RA) as well as the various bone phenotypes found in immunocompromised gene-deficient mice has highlighted the importance of the dynamic interplay between the two systems. This has led to the recent emergence and subsequent rapid evolution of the field of osteoimmunology.

**Bone Destruction with Arthritis as a RANKL Disease** In the bone destruction associated with RA, IL-17-producing helper T cells (T~H~17) play a major role by inducing receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL). RANKL stimulates osteoclastogenesis through nuclear factor of activated T cells cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), which is well known as a crucial regulator of immunity.

**New Players in Osteoimmunology** In addition to cellular interactions via cytokines, the immune and skeletal systems share various molecules, including transcription factors, signaling molecules, and membrane receptors.

**Conclusion** The scope of osteoimmunology has grown to encompass a wide range of molecular and cellular interactions, the elucidation of which will provide a scientific basis for future therapeutic approaches to diseases of both the immune and skeletal systems.

## Introduction

The bony skeleton enables weight-bearing locomotive activity, the storage of calcium, and the harboring of the hematopoietic stem cells from which blood and immune cells are derived. Although bone appears to be metabolically inert, it is actually a dynamic organ under the active control of osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Excessive osteoclast activity leads to pathological bone resorption as seen in a variety of local or generalized osteopenic conditions. Therefore, the elucidation of the regulatory mechanisms involved in osteoclastogenesis is critical for a deeper understanding of the skeletal system in health and disease [1-3].

Traditionally, the endocrine system has been understood to be in the mainstream of the regulatory systems of the osteoclast lineage; however, accumulating evidence suggests that osteoclasts and immune cells share a number of regulatory molecules, including cytokines, receptors, signaling molecules, and transcription factors, which mutually influence each other. Furthermore, immune cells are derived from bone marrow and, thus, develop in the same microenvironments as osteoclasts [1, 4]. In fact, patients with excessive activation of the immune system, as in the case of arthritis, are also at higher risk of experiencing concomitant osteoporosis, as well as localized bone destruction. In addition, mice deficient in immunomodulatory molecules have been found to frequently develop an

abnormal osteoclast phenotype [1] and have afforded pivotal insight into osteoclast biology. Here, we summarize recent progress in the understanding of osteoclast development in the context of the newly established interdisciplinary field of “osteoinmunology” [1, 4].

### The Essential Role of RANKL in Bone Metabolism

A relationship between the immune and skeletal systems has long been recognized. More than three decades ago, antigen-stimulated immune cells were shown to produce soluble factors that stimulate osteoclastic bone resorption [5]. In the 1980s, interleukin (IL)-1 was identified as one of these factors [6, 7]. In the late 1980s, an in vitro coculture system for osteoclast formation was established. This system revealed the importance of the cell-to-cell contact of osteoblasts/stromal cells and hematopoietic cells for osteoclast differentiation [8, 9]. Based on this insight, it was proposed that osteoclastogenesis-supporting mesenchymal cells express osteoclast differentiation factor (ODF) as a membrane-associated protein [10].

In 1997, the potential inhibitor of osteoclastogenesis osteoprotegerin (OPG) was cloned [11, 12]. In 1998, OPG was found to associate with a transmembrane protein of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily and to function as a decoy receptor [13, 14]. Interestingly, immunologists cloned the same molecule as a stimulator of the dendritic cells expressed by T cells and called it receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL) or TNF-related activation-induced cytokine [15, 16]. This transmembrane protein RANKL is, in fact, the long-sought ODF. The receptor for RANKL is RANK, a type-I transmembrane protein, which, similar to other members of the TNF receptor family, assembles into a functional trimer upon stimulation [15, 17]. Mice with a disruption of *Rank* or *Rankl* exhibit severe osteopetrosis accompanied by a defect in tooth eruption owing to a complete lack of osteoclasts. These genetic findings clearly demonstrate that RANK and RANKL are essential for osteoclastogenesis in vivo [18–21]. In contrast, mice lacking *Opg* exhibit severe osteoporosis, resulting from both an increased number and enhanced activity of osteoclasts [22, 23]. The phenotypes of these genetically modified mice are summarized in Table I. In humans, mutations in *RANK*, *RANKL*, and *OPG* have been identified in patients with bone disorders, familial expansile osteolysis, autosomal recessive osteopetrosis, and juvenile Paget’s disease of bone, respectively [24–28] (Table II).

RANKL functions as a membrane-anchored molecule and is released from the cell surface as a soluble molecule following proteolytic cleavage by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) such as MMP-14 [29, 30]. Both the soluble and membrane-bound RANKL forms function as agonistic ligands for RANK. However, we and other researchers have suggested that membrane-bound RANKL is more efficient than soluble RANKL [29, 31, 32]. In addition, previous studies have indicated that RANKL serves as both a chemotactic and survival factor for osteoclasts [33, 34]. RANKL is mainly expressed in mesenchymal cells, such as osteoblast/stromal and synovial cells. RANKL expression can be upregulated by osteoclastogenic factors such as vitamin D₃, prostaglandin E₂, parathyroid hormone, IL-1, IL-6, IL-11, IL-17, and TNF-α [2, 29].

### Immunological Function of RANKL/RANK

Intriguingly, in addition to a defect in osteoclasts, both RANK- and RANKL-deficient mice have a defect in the development and organization of secondary lymphoid tissue [18, 20, 35]. However, RANKL-deficient mice also have reduced thymus size and impaired thymocyte differentiation. Although the mRNA of RANK can be found in the thymus of RANKL-deficient mice, RANK-deficient mice do not display any obvious defects in thymocytes. This phenotypic difference in the thymus is only evident distinction between RANKL- and RANK-deficient mice [18, 20]. This observation suggests that RANKL has the potential to act on another receptor during thymocyte development, which remains to be investigated further. Severe immunodeficiency is not observed in RANKL-deficient mice nor have obvious adverse effects in the immune system been reported to result from the administration of anti-RANKL antibody in humans [36]. The loss of RANKL in T cells seems to be compensated by CD40L in mice [37]. These observations initially suggested that the immunological function of RANKL is of lesser importance, but recent studies have revealed a crucial role for RANKL in the immune system. RANKL has been shown to play a role in a pathological model of inflammatory bowel disease by stimulating dendritic cells [38, 39], suggesting that RANKL is distinctly involved in the activation of dendritic cells under certain autoimmune conditions. On the other hand, keratinocytes express RANKL in response to ultraviolet stimulation of the skin, which may activate Langerhans cells and trigger expansion of regulatory T (Treg) cells in draining lymph nodes [40]. Vitamin D₃, which is produced in the skin in response to sun exposure, has long been known to have immunosuppressive functions and to induce RANKL on osteoclastogenesis-supporting mesenchymal cells in bone. Thus, the suggested role for RANKL/RANK might be the missing link mediating sunlight-induced immunosuppression. In addition, recent reports suggest that RANK is a key molecule that triggers the development of autoimmune regulator (Aire)-expressing

medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) [41] and cooperation between RANK and CD40 also promotes mTECs development, thereby establishing self-tolerance [42, 43]. Although the functions of RANKL/RANK in the immune system need to be elucidated in greater detail, the discovery and subsequent functional analysis of RANKL has become the driving force for the understanding of the osteoimmune axis (Table I).

Intracellular Signal Transduction of RANKL  

RANK is a transmembrane molecule expressed on osteoclast precursor cells and mature osteoclasts. The ligation of RANK with RANKL results in the commitment of monocyte/macrophage precursor cells to the osteoclast lineage and the activation of mature osteoclasts. RANK lacks intrinsic enzymatic activity in its intracellular domain  

and transduces signals by recruiting adaptor molecules such as the TNF receptor-associated factor (TRAF) family of proteins [1]. Genetic approaches coupled with intensive molecular analyses have identified TRAF6 as the main adaptor molecule that links RANK to both osteoclastogenesis and lymph node development [44-46]. By an as-yet unknown mechanism, RANKL binding to RANK induces the trimerization of RANK and TRAF6, which leads to the activation of nuclear factor-$\kappa$B (NF-$\kappa$B) and mitogen-activated kinases, including Jun N-terminal kinase and p38 [47]. The spatiotemporal control of the RANK signaling cascade during osteoclastogenesis is summarized in Fig. 1.  

The essential role of NF-$\kappa$B in osteoclastogenesis has been demonstrated genetically [48, 49]. NF-$\kappa$B$p50$ and $p52$ double-deficient mice develop severe osteopetrosis because of a defect in osteoclastogenesis. The upstream kinase complex that mediates inhibitor of NF-$\kappa$B (IkB) phosphorylation and degradation, comprising the catalytic

Fig. 1 Signaling cascades during osteoclastogenesis. Osteoclastogenesis is cooperatively induced by macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), receptor activator of nuclear factor-κB ligand (RANKL), and its costimulatory factor, immunoglobulin-like receptor (IgLR). **a** Precursor-cell stage. The binding of M-CSF to its receptor, c-Fms, activates the proliferation and survival of osteoclast precursor cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage and induces RANK expression. The costimulatory receptors might be stimulated at early stages, although the ligands of the costimulatory receptors have yet to be identified. **b** Proximal RANK signals. RANKL binding to RANK results in the recruitment of tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and, at the same time, the phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM) in DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and Fc receptor common γ subunit (FcRγ), (both of) which are adaptor proteins which associate with distinct IgLRs. **c** Initial induction of NFATc1. NFATc1, a master transcription factor for osteoclastogenesis, is initially induced by the TRAF6-activated NF-κB and NFATc2 that are present in the cell before RANKL stimulation. RANK and ITAM signals cooperate to phosphorylate phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ) NFATc1. The tyrosine kinases Btk and Tec are activated by RANK and are important for the phosphorylation of PLCγ, thus, linking the two pathways. **d** Autoamplification of NFATc1. Calcium signal-mediated persistent activation of NFATc1, as well as cooperation with activator protein 1 (AP-1), is a prerequisite for the robust induction of NFATc1. AP-1 activation is mediated by the induction and activation of c-Fos by calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase type IV (CaMKIV)-stimulated cyclic AMP-responsive element-binding protein (CREB) and c-Fms. The NFATc1 promoter is epigenetically activated through histone acetylation and NFATc1 binds to an NFAT-binding site on its own promoter. **e** In the nucleus, NFATc1 works together with other transcription factors, such as AP-1, PU.1, CREB, and MITF, to induce various osteoclast-specific genes.

### Osteoclastogenic Transcription Factor NFATc1

Importantly, RANKL specifically and strongly induces nuclear factor of activated T cells, cytoplasmic 1 (NFATc1), the master regulator of osteoclast differentiation, and this induction is dependent on both the TRAF6-NF-κB and c-Fos pathways [62]. The NFAT family of transcription factors was originally discovered in T cells, but its members are involved in the regulation of various biological systems [63, 64]. The activation of NFAT is mediated by a specific phosphatase, calcineurin, which is activated by calcium-calmodulin signaling. The essential and sufficient role of the *Nfatcl* gene in osteoclastogenesis has been shown both in vitro and in vivo [62, 65-67]. The *Nfatcl* promoter contains NFAT binding sites and NFATc1 specifically autoregulates its own promoter during osteoclastogenesis, thus, enabling the robust induction of NFATc1 [65]. AP-1 containing c-Fos, together with continuous activation of calcium signaling, is crucial for this autoamplification [62, 68]. NFATc1 regulates a number of osteoclast-specific genes in cooperation with other transcription factors such as AP-1, PU.1, and MITF [1]. Osteoclasts mature into multinuclear giant cells by the fusion of mononuclear osteoclasts. Expression of fusion-mediating molecules such as the d2 isoform of the vacuolar ATPase Vo domain (Atp6v0d2) [69] and the dendritic cell-specific transmembrane protein [70] are directly regulated by NFATc1 [71]. A recent study indicated that CREB, activated by CaMKIV,
also cooperates with NFATc1 in the activation of osteoclast-specific genes (Fig. 1). However, compared with the wealth of information on RANK signaling in osteoclasts, it is as yet unclear whether RANK uses the same signaling mechanisms in the immune system. Although the regulation of NFATc1 by calcium–calcineurin is well documented, it is interesting to note that NFATc1 is also regulated by other factors, such as pH [72].

### Calcium Signaling and Immunoreceptors in Osteoclastogenesis

Phospholipase Cγ (PLCγ), which mediates Ca²⁺ release from intracellular stores, is crucial for the activation of the key transcription factor NFATc1 via calcineurin [62]. However, despite the evident importance of the calcium–NFAT pathway, it has remained unclear how RANKL activates calcium signals. RANK belongs to the TNF receptor family, which has yet to be directly connected to calcium signaling. The activation of PLCγ by RANK requires the protein tyrosine kinase Syk, along with immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif (ITAM)-bearing molecules, such as DNAX-activating protein (DAP12) and the Fc receptor common gamma chain (FcRγ) [73]. In the osteoclast lineage, immunoglobulin-like receptors associated with DAP12 include triggering receptor expressed in myeloid cells 2 (TREM-2) and signal-regulatory protein β1; those associated with FcRγ include osteoclast-associated receptor and paired immunoglobulin-like receptor A. As ITAM signals are essential for osteoclastogenesis, but by themselves cannot induce osteoclastogenesis, these signals should properly be considered costimulatory signals for RANK. The binding of M-CSF to its receptor c-Fms also generates a signaling complex comprising phosphorylated DAP12 and the nonreceptor tyrosine kinase Syk [74]. In addition, mutation of TREM-2 or DAP12 in humans leads to Nasu–Hakola disease, which is characterized by bone cysts [73, 75]. Thus, RANKL and M-CSF signals appear to converge on the ITAM signaling pathway.

It is also conceivable that RANK activates an as-yet unknown pathway that specifically synergizes with or upregulates ITAM signaling. Recently, we have shown that Tec family tyrosine kinases such as Btk and Tec are activated by RANK and are involved in the phosphorylation of PLCγ, which leads to the release of calcium from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the generation of IP3 [76]. An osteopetrotic phenotype in Tec and Btk double-deficient mice revealed these two kinases play an essential role in the regulation of osteoclastogenesis. Tec and Btk had been known to play a key role in proximal BCR signaling, but this study established their crucial role in linking RANK and ITAM signals. This study also identified an osteoclastogenic signaling complex, composed of Tec kinases and scaffold proteins, which affords a new paradigm for the signal transduction mechanism of osteoclast differentiation (Fig. 1).

The phosphorylation of PLCγ is important in this regard to determine how depletion of the ER calcium store and the store-operated calcium entry contribute to calcium signaling during osteoclastogenesis. Recent studies have shown that the RGS10 activated by RANK mediates calcium oscillation [77] and TRPV4, a Ca²⁺-permeable channel of the transient receptor potential family, regulates calcium influx in osteoclasts [78]. These results suggest that the Ca²⁺ oscillations which are based on store-operated Ca²⁺ entry are required to sustain NFATc1-dependent gene expression, but there is an interesting report that deletion of the two types of IP3 receptors does not affect osteoclastogenesis in vivo [79]. Calcium oscillation appears to be important for the long-term activation of NFAT [80], but it remains to be determined which type of calcium signal is essential for osteoclast differentiation. Based on the phenotype exhibited by knockout mice, PLCγ2 was shown to be required for RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis due to its regulation of calcium signaling. PLCγ2 forms a complex with Gab2 and modulates Gab2 recruitment to RANK in osteoclasts [81], suggesting an additional role for PLCγ in RANK signaling.

### Bone Destruction with Arthritis as a RANKL Disease

Activation of the immune system is essential for host defense against pathogens, but aberrant and/or prolonged activation under pathological conditions results in tissue damage owing to the persistent overactivation of effector cells. In RA, a long-standing question is how abnormal T-cell activation (characterized by the infiltration of CD4⁺ T cells) mechanistically induces bone damage [1]. The identification of osteoclast-like giant cells at the interface between synovium and bone in the rheumatoid joints dates back to the early 1980s [82]. These multinucleated giant cells were further characterized as being positive for tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and the calcitonin receptor, which are characteristic of authentic osteoclasts. TRAP-positive multinucleated cells are frequently observed in the synovium, which is not in contact with bone [83]. These pathological findings led us to hypothesize that osteoclasts play an important role in bone resorption in arthritis and that the osteoclasts are formed in the synovium [83, 84]. Can osteoclasts be generated from synovial cells alone? We answered this question affirmatively by generating osteoclasts in synovial cell culture without adding any other cells, thus, demonstrating that rheumatoid synovial cells contain both osteoclast
precursor and osteoclastogenesis-supporting cells [84]. Further studies indicated that synovial fibroblasts express membrane-bound factor(s) that stimulate osteoclastogenesis and induce the differentiation of synovial macrophages into osteoclasts, but it was not until RANKL was cloned that the membrane-bound factor on the synovial cells came to light [85].

Importantly, inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-α, which are abundant in the synovial fluid and synovium of RA patients, have a potent capacity to induce RANKL on synovial fibroblasts/osteoblasts and to accelerate RANKL signaling, thus, directly contributing to the bone destruction process [1]. Several groups, including our own, have demonstrated the high expression of RANKL in the synovium of RA patients [85–87]. RANKL was found to be expressed by synovial cells and T cells, both of which are found in the inflamed synovium [85–87], but it was unclear which cell types were the major RANKL-expressing cells at that point. Nevertheless, a series of reports has established that the bone damage associated with inflammation is the pathological condition caused by an abnormal expression of RANKL. Additionally, osteoclast-deficient mice are protected from bone erosion in arthritis models [88, 89]. In the absence of osteoclasts, bone destruction did not occur despite a similar level of inflammation, indicating that RANKL and osteoclasts are indispensable for the bone loss associated with inflammation. Blocking RANKL through OPG treatment significantly prevented bone destruction in adjuvant arthritis [86]. Consistent with this, anti-RANKL and anti-osteoclast therapies have been shown to be beneficial for the inhibition of bone loss without affecting the immune system in clinical trials as well as in the treatment of an animal model of arthritis [86, 90, 91].

both of which are anti-osteoclastogenic, it has been a paradox that the activated CD4⁺ T cells in arthritis enhance osteoclastogenesis in the presence of these cytokines. This is in striking contrast to the frequent observation that exaggerated osteoclastic bone resorption is associated with activation of T cell immune responses under autoimmune or infectious conditions. Thus, a novel insight was needed to understand this discrepancy. This prompted our investigation to identify the putative osteoclastogenic Tₕ cells (TₕOc cells) [1].

Tₕ cells have traditionally been divided into two main subsets according to the cytokines they produce, namely, Tₕ1 and Tₕ2. Tₕ1 cells, which are induced by IL-12, produce mainly IFN-γ and IL-2. Tₕ1 cells are involved in cellular immunity, whereas the Tₕ2 cells that mainly produce IL-4, IL-5, and IL-10 are involved in humoral immunity. RA has been considered to be a disease in which the Tₕ1/Tₕ2 balance is skewed toward Tₕ1 [1]. However, IFN-γ and IL-2, the key cytokines produced by Tₕ1 cells, are not highly expressed in RA joints [94]. Moreover, IFN-γ potently inhibits osteoclastogenesis, even at minute concentrations, and the severity of collagen-induced arthritis is reported to be exaggerated in the absence of IFN-γ signaling [93], suggesting the notion that Tₕ1 cells are not linked to bone damage in arthritis.

Previous reports from our laboratory and others on synovial T cells in RA have determined the characteristics of TₕOc cells. First, TₕOc cells do not produce a large amount of IFN-γ. Second, they trigger local inflammation and the production of inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, which induce RANKL expression on synovial fibroblasts. Third, TₕOc cells express RANKL and might directly participate in accelerated osteoclastogenesis. Based on these osteoclastogenic characteristics, these cells can tip the balance in favor of osteoclastogenesis in various respects. Although autoimmune arthritis has been traditionally classified as a Tₕ1-type disease, Tₕ1 cells do not have the requisite characteristics to fulfill this role, indicating that the TₕOc cells might belong to an as yet unknown subset.

Regulation of Osteoclastogenesis by T Cells

As RANKL is expressed in activated T cells, T cells might have the capacity to induce osteoclast differentiation by directly acting on osteoclast precursor cells under pathological conditions [86, 92]. However, interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which is produced by T cells, potently suppresses RANKL signaling through a rapid degradation of TRAF6 [93]. To fully understand the effects of T cells on osteoclastogenesis, it is absolutely necessary to elucidate the specific effects of the various cytokines which T cells produce. The effects of T cells on osteoclastogenesis would be expected to be dependent on the balance between positive and negative factors expressed by the T cells. As the CD4⁺ T helper (Tₕ)-cell subsets Tₕ1 and Tₕ2 produce IFN-γ and IL-4, respectively,

Tₕ17 Cells Exclusively Function as an Osteoclastogenic T Cell Subset

Recent data from our laboratory indicate that an IL-17 producing Tₕ-cell subset (Tₕ17 cells) represents the long-sought-after TₕOc cell subset among the known CD4⁺ T cell lineages, whereas Tₕ1 and Tₕ2 cells have anti-osteoclastogenic effects [95]. It had already been reported that IL-17 expression is increased in RA joints [96]. IL-17 is well known to induce local inflammation in autoimmune

diseases through inflammatory cytokine production [97-99]. Moreover, IL-17 induces RANKL on mesenchymal cells [96]. We have also shown that T_H17 cells express higher levels of RANKL than T_H1 and T_H2 cells [95]. Therefore, the infiltration of T_H17 cells into the inflammatory lesion links the abnormal T-cell response to bone damage in arthritis, and the pathogenesis of RA should be reconsidered in the context of a T_H17-type disease (Fig. 2). Clearly, this subset is an auspicious target for future therapeutic investigation, and cytokines related to T_H17-cell differentiation and expansion, such as IL-6, TGF-β, and IL-23, are of potentially great clinical importance [100, 101]. Treg are characterized as CD4⁺ CD25⁺ T cells which have the capacity to inhibit the activation of other T cells, especially autoreactive T cells. Suppression of Treg function exacerbates arthritis, and increasing the number of Treg leads to the amelioration of inflammation and bone destruction [102], suggesting that Treg modulation is potentially beneficial in the treatment of bone destruction. There are reports that suggest the bone-protective effects of Treg are mediated by direct inhibitory effects on osteoclastogenesis [103], but modulation of Treg in vivo inevitably

affects the immune system, and this possibility needs to be evaluated further in more sophisticated in vivo systems.

### Clinical Implications

A detailed osteoimmunological understanding of the pathogenesis of bone destruction will support novel strategies in the treatment of various diseases, including, but not limited to, RA, periodontal disease, Paget’s disease, osteoporosis, osteoarthritis, multiple myeloma, and metastatic bone tumors [1, 2, 4]. The action of TNF-α and other inflammatory cytokines is not limited to the induction of local inflammation but is both directly and indirectly involved in the activation of osteoclasts [104]. A recent report showed that TNF-α induces Dickkopf-1 (DKK-1), an inhibitor of Wnt signaling, and that neutralization of DKK-1 leads to an increase in bone formation as well as a decrease in bone resorption [105]. Such osteoimmunological pleiotropy might explain the dramatic efficacy of biological agents that inhibit cytokines so as to ameliorate

Fig. 2 Mechanisms of bone destruction in arthritis. In rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory synovium invades and destroys bone, a process which is mediated by osteoclasts. Cells in the synovium include synovial macrophages and fibroblasts in addition to infiltrating CD4⁺ T cells. Interleukin-17 (IL-17)-secreting T helper cells (T_H17 cells) are the only osteoclastogenic T_H-cell subset (T_HOc cells) characterized thus far. T_H17 cells do not produce interferon-γ (IFN-γ), which suppresses RANKL signaling, but do secrete relatively large amounts

of IL-17, which induces RANKL on synovial fibroblasts. IL-17 also stimulates local inflammation and activates synovial macrophages to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-α, IL-1, and IL-6. These cytokines activate osteoclast precursor cells or inducing RANKL on synovial fibroblasts. T_H17 cells also express RANKL on the cell membrane, which partly contributes to the enhanced osteoclastogenesis (the dotted line)
or even prevent bone destruction. In addition, the efficacy of a RANKL-specific antibody for postmenopausal osteoporosis and RA in clinical trials has been reported [36, 106], and its apparent preventative effect on bone metastasis is enormously promising [33, 107]. Pharmaceutical blockade of RANK is also a viable strategy for preventing bone destruction. Recently, a cytoplasmic motif of RANK was identified that may be specifically involved in osteoclastogenesis, and a cell-permeable peptide inhibitor, which targets this motif, has been developed [108].

The clinical relevance of newly recognized cytokines such as IL-17 and IL-23 is being tested in human trials, and IL-6 inhibition, for which a drug has been approved for the treatment of structural joint damage in RA in Japan in advance of the anticipated worldwide approval, might have a dual impact on T_H17-mediated immune and bone responses [109]. Although it is difficult to specifically target transcription factors and signaling molecules in drug treatment, NF-κB inhibitors are also undergoing development [110]. Based on recent findings, NFATc1 is another important research target for the treatment of excessive osteoclastogenesis. Indeed, some currently prescribed anti-rheumatic drugs have been shown to inhibit osteoclastogenesis by suppressing the induction of NFATc1 [111, 112]. Therefore, the osteoimmunological perspective, together with the spate of emerging findings, has enabled the acquisition of profound insight into the mode of action of therapeutic drugs, as well as novel strategies for drug design.

### Conclusion

The bone and immune systems share an abundance of molecules and regulatory mechanisms. However, despite recent advances in the field of osteoimmunology, a number of significant questions persist. It remains unclear, for example, how distinct functions are achieved through ostensibly similar mechanisms. It is of critical importance to determine how the immune response is regulated by bone cells. In fact, the bone and immune systems are so closely intermingled all factors that regulate immune cells should be investigated for their effect on bone and vice versa. Such a complementary approach will be greatly facilitated by the increasing availability of genetically modified mice and will lead to a deeper understanding of the molecular basis for cell lineage specification. Most importantly, cell-type-specific treatments, despite the similarity and, indeed, overlap of the two systems, may, thus, become a realistic therapeutic option. The novel functions of bone cells in the regulation of cells outside the bone will, therefore, have an impact on many arenas of biomedical investigation. In the end, both clinical and nonclinical researchers are expected to derive benefit from the insights emerging from osteoimmunology.

### New Players in Osteoimmunology

Since immune cells infiltrate into any tissues and organs, bone is not the only tissue linked to the immune system. However, bone has a distinct status as a central immunological organ, since hematopoietic stem cells are maintained in the bone marrow [113]. Thus, the bone is crucially different from other tissues into which effector immune cells merely infiltrate [1, 113]. It has been suggested that osteoblasts compose the niche required for the maintenance of hematopoietic stem cells [113]. Since it has been shown that the localization of CXCL12-expressing cells (critically important for the colonization of hematopoietic stem cells) does not always match with that of osteoblasts [114] and it remains unclear how bone-forming activity is related to the function of the hematopoietic niche, osteoblast function in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cells is an intriguing subject for future study. Osteoclasts are also suggested to have a role in the mobilization of hematopoietic cells from the bone marrow [115]. If osteoclasts are indeed required for the immune response, it would further highlight bone as an immunological organ, but a great deal of work lies ahead before this can be concluded. In addition, a recent report showed that osteoblasts provide an osteoclast niche, suggesting a general importance of osteoblasts as the maintenance system for other bone marrow cells [116].

Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) is a regulator of lymphocyte chemotaxis and known to be a target of the immunosuppressant FTY720. A recent study has shown S1P to be a new player in osteoimmunology, acting as a regulator of osteoclast precursor migration. Treatment with the S1P receptor agonist (FTY720) ameliorates bone loss in osteoporosis by reducing the number of osteoclasts on the bone surface [117]. It is still unclear why FTY720 treatment inhibits the egress of lymphocytes into the peripheral blood (as a functional antagonist) but increases that of osteoclast precursors (as a functional agonist).

Cathepsin K is a cysteine protease identified in osteoclasts and has been thought to be specifically expressed in osteoclasts. Recently, we reported that a cathepsin K inhibitor suppresses not only osteoclastic bone resorption but also autoimmune inflammation [118]. Further studies revealed cathepsin K to regulate T_H17 differentiation by mediating the TLR9-mediated activation of dendritic cells and the production of cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-23 [118]. This is an interesting example of a molecule originally found in bone which was subsequently shown to regulate the immune system.
