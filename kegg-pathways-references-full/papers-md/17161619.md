Abstract

Our intestine is colonized by an impressive community of bacteria, that has profound effects on the immune functions. The relationship between gut microbiota and the immune system is one of reciprocity: bacteria have important contribution in nutrient processing and education of the immune system and conversely, the immune system, particularly gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) plays a key role in shaping the repertoire of gut microbiota. In this review we discuss new insights into the role of IgA in the maintenance of immune homeostasis and the reciprocal interactions between gut B cells and intestinal bacteria.

1. Introduction

The prokaryotic kingdom represents the largest component of biosphere that has undoubtedly functioned as a major selective force for evolution of eukaryotic organisms. Adaptive co-evolution of mammals and bacteria led to the establishment of commensal and symbiotic relationships that have contributed to the development of the immune system and maintenance of our normal physiology [1,2].

One site with perhaps the most complex and dynamic mutualistic eukaryotic-prokaryotic relationships is the gastrointestinal tract. The gut is thought to harbor 500–1000 microbial species that provide metabolic traits, including the ability to break down otherwise undigestible food components, as well as natural defense against colonization with pathogens [3]. Indeed, recognition of commensal bacterial products through toll-like receptors (TLR) plays a critical role in epithelial homeostasis, by inducing secretion of protective factors that strengthens the epithelial resistance to pathogens [4]. Furthermore, interaction of commensal bacteria with specialized cells located in intestinal crypts, called Paneth cells, leads to secretion of antimicrobial products that contribute not only to enforcement of epithelium and surveillance of stem cell niche, but also to systemic responses to infection [5,6].

Besides these functions, and perhaps the most important, is the role that the gut microbiota plays in education of the immune system. The continuous dialog between immune cells and bacteria ensures the fitness of the immune system, which is translated into a state of hypo-responsiveness against some environmental antigens (such as dietary antigens and commensals) and paradoxically, a state of readiness that allows efficient and prompt responses against other antigens, such as pathogens.

A conspicuous response of the immune system that follows the microbial gut colonization is the production of IgA by the gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT).

In humans, at least 80% of all plasma cells are located in the gut lamina propria, and together they produce more IgA (40–60 mg/kg/day) than any other immunoglobulin isotypes combined [7,8]. The IgA is secreted mainly as dimers or larger polymers (pIgA), after incorporation of the J chain and association with a transmembrane epithelial glycoprotein known as polymeric-immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR) [9].

The finding that IgA is the most abundant Ig isotype in mucosal secretions generated important questions regarding the origin of IgA plasma cell precursors, the sites of the antigen-specific induction of IgA and their migration to the mucosal sites.

The major concepts derived from intensive research, which was initiated by landmark experiments of Craig and Cebra [10] are as follows:

1. The majority of intestinal IgA⁺ plasma cell precursors reside in the gut follicular structures such as Peyer’s patches (PP).
2. IgA⁺ B-cell development is dependent on antigenic stimulation and T cell help, which induces germinal centre (GC) formation.
3. PP GCs are intrinsically different to other GC, owing to the presence of special T cells (CD4⁺) and dendritic cells (DC) that promote class-switching specifically to IgA.
4. There is a preferential homing of IgA⁺ B cells but not IgM⁺ or IgG⁺ B cells to the mucosal tissues, due to special adhesion molecules as well as factors derived from local environments that selectively attract the circulating precursors of mucosal IgA plasma cells.
5. IgA provides protection against bacterial, parasitic and viral mucosal pathogens.

These conclusions represent a solid foundation that allowed further scientific quests into the complexity, diversity and dynamism of the immune responses and reciprocal relationships between bacteria and the immune system.

Here we attempt to combine the classic, basic knowledge of the mucosal immune system with recent developments that revealed new layers of complexity relating with the sites, mechanisms and function of gut IgA. We focus on recruitment of IgM⁺ B cells to the gut lamina propria, cellular and molecular mechanisms for IgA predominance in the intestine, and discuss the role of intestinal IgAs for immune homeostasis.

2. Generation of mucosal IgA in organized follicular structures

The GALT, which is the main site for generation of mucosal immune responses, is generally divided into two compartments: inductive sites, represented by organized follicular structures and effector site, represented by diffuse tissue of the intestinal lamina propria (LP) [11,12]. The major inductive sites in the small intestine are PP and solitary follicles scattered throughout the intestine called isolated lymphoid follicles (ILF) [13,14]. Unlike PPs, which are formed before birth, and thus independent of bacterial stimulation, solitary follicles develop only after bacterial colonization of the intestine [13,15]. However, the organization of PP and ILFs is probably similar and requires multiple interactions between inducer cells of hematopoietic origin and organizer mesenchimal cells [16]. Among the key events absolutely necessary for PP and ILF formation is the expression of LTα1β2 on CD3⁻CD4⁺IL-7R⁺ inducer cells upon stimulation through IL-7R, and its interaction with LTβR⁺ organizer cells [17–20]. Several feedback loops necessary for PP and ILF formation involve chemokines and adhesion molecules such as CXCR5-CXCL13 and CXCR5-induced α4β1-VCAM-1 interactions [21].

It is generally accepted that the majority of precursors for IgA⁺ plasma cells are generated in the PP, after antigenic stimulation and induction of GC [22–24]. The GC is a special microenvironment that allows interactions between B cells, antigens trapped on follicular dendritic cells (FDC) and local CD4 T cells, and facilitate B cell proliferation, class switch recombination (CSR) and somatic hypermutation (SHM) and affinity maturation which are necessary for efficient humoral responses [25–27].

Indeed, neonatal mice or germ-free mice are almost completely devoid of IgA⁺ B cells in gut. However, gut IgA⁺ B cells are detected after bacterial colonization, around the peak of the GC reaction in PP, and these IgAs commonly have specificities against molecules such as phosphocholine, β2-1 fructosyl and β galactosyl groups associated with bacteria present in the intestine [28]. In conventionally reared mice, PP as well as ILF, which are induced to develop by bacterial stimulation (see later discussion), continuously exhibit GC, and contain the highest proportion of actively dividing IgA⁺ B cells as compared with GC from spleen or peripheral lymph nodes, in which the predominant switched isotype is IgG [28].

The IgA⁺ B cells in PP or ILF are generated by in situ switching of IgM⁺ B cells after antigenic stimulation. This is demonstrated by the presence of large amounts of AID, the master molecule for CSR and SHM [29], in IgM⁺ B cells from PP [30]. Furthermore, footprints for recent switching can be detected in PP IgA⁺ B cells. These are short-lived transcripts, known as α circle-transcripts (αCT), which are initiated from the Iα promoter located in the circular DNA that is looped out during IgA switching [30,31]. This preferential switching to IgA in PP, led to the proposal that PP GC are intrinsically different from other GC, most likely due to the constant antigenic stimulation, the presence of special regulatory T cells and dendritic cells (DC) that through co-stimulatory molecules (CD40-CD40L, CD80/CD86-CD28) and Th2 cytokines would promote efficient switching to IgA [22,32–34].

3. Generation of mucosal IgA outside organized follicular structures

Multiple studies in genetically manipulated mice however, revealed a poor correlation between the presence of GC, organized follicular structures such as PP and IgA plasma cells in the LP, implying the existence of multiple, intricate pathways for IgA B cell development in gut. For example, fully functional, somatically mutated gut IgA against T-dependent antigens does not necessarily require the presence of GC. CD28⁻/⁻ mice that lack GC and have an impaired systemic response show normal mucosal IgA responses to a T-dependent antigen [35]. This would imply that T cell activation by the B7-CD28 signaling pathway which is essential for serum IgA (and IgG) responses can be complemented by an alternative, mucosal-specific and GC-independent mechanism.

Peritoneal B1 cells, which are known to be unable to migrate to GC in PP, generate large amounts of gut IgA, at least in immuno-deficient mice [36–38]. Unlike the IgA generated in the PP, IgA production by B1 cells appears to be independent of T-cell help, and functionally, the B1-derived IgAs appear to be

fully capable to prevent systemic invasion of intestinal bacteria [39,40].

Furthermore, mice deficient for inhibitor of bHLH transcription factor (Id2), retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) γt⁻/⁻ mice, or bone marrow (BM)-reconstituted LTα⁻/⁻ or TNF-LTα⁻/⁻ mice, which lack PP, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN) or any other gut follicular structures including ILF, do have IgA plasma cells in the intestine, although their number varies, depending on the mice background and rearing conditions [41–43]. These observations clearly indicate that gut IgAs can be also generated outside GC or gut organized follicular structures.

### 4. Homing of IgA⁺ B cells from the inductive to the effector sites

It is still generally accepted that from PP, IgA⁺ B cells migrate to the draining MLN, where they further proliferate and differentiate into plasmablasts, which, via the thoracic duct and blood, home preferentially to the gut LP [44,45]. The tissue specificity of IgA⁺ B cell homing is the result of complex interactions between receptors present on the lymphocytes and their ligands expressed on the vascular endothelium of the target tissues [46]. The selective migration to gut LP is principally achieved through down-regulation of L-selectin and strong induction of integrin α4β7, which allows a preferential interaction of intestinal lymphocytes with vascular addressin molecule MadCAM-1, abundantly expressed by postcapillary venules in the gut LP [47]. The preferential homing of IgA⁺ but not IgM⁺ or IgG⁺ B cells to the gut LP in normal mice is explained by the selective expression on IgA⁺ B cells of CCR9, the receptor for TECK/CCL25, chemokine abundantly secreted by the crypt epithelium [48–50]. Further migration into the LP of the villi is proposed to depend on CXCL12, as IgA⁺ B cells (as well as IgM⁺ and IgG⁺ cells) respond to CXCL12, and this chemokine is also expressed in the gut [51].

### 5. Migration of IgM⁺ B cells to the gut LP

Generation of IgA plasma cells independent of GALT and the presence of IgM⁺ B cells in the LP, suggest that some IgM⁺ B cells are able to directly migrate to the LP. Recent studies revealed that a functional LTβR signaling on LP stromal cells is crucial for the presence of IgM⁺ B cells and IgA plasma cells in the gut LP.

Indeed, LTβR⁻/⁻ mice and aly/aly mice, which have impaired signaling through LTβR because of a point mutation in the downstream signaling molecule nuclear factor-κB-inducing kinase (NIK) [52], are completely devoid of IgM⁺ B cells and IgA plasma cells in the gut LP [38,42]. Reconstitution of aly/aly or LTβR⁻/⁻ with BM cells fails to restore the number of B cells and IgA plasma cells in the gut, unless co-injected with NIK-sufficient gut stromal cells or transplanted with a segment of normal small intestine [42,53] (Fig. 1). These facts, together with the observation that administration of LTβR antagonists after birth causes a marked decrease in the number of LP B cells and plasma cells [54], demonstrate the essential role of permanent signaling through LTβR/NIK on gut stromal cells for the B cell recruitment to gut. Although the impaired

**Fig. 1. Migration of IgM⁺ B cells to gut lamina propria of aly/aly mice.** (a) Naive IgM⁺ B cells derived from BM of GFP Tg mice injected into lethally irradiated aly/aly failed to reconstitute IgM⁺ in the LP, (b) but migrated into RAG2⁻/⁻ intestine, after parabiosis. The cells that experienced RAG2⁻/⁻ gut efficiently migrated to LP of aly/aly parabiotic partner. FACS profiles of GFP⁺ LP cells, 10 weeks after transfer or 3 days after ligation are shown in (a) and (b), respectively. (c) Naive IgM⁺ BM-derived B cells co-injected with NIK-sufficient LP stromal cells also migrate to LP of aly/aly, although less efficient than gut-experienced B cells and generate in situ IgA plasma cells. Representative FACS profiles of GFP⁺ gated LP cells stained for B cells (B220⁺IgM⁺) or plasma cells (B220⁻IgA⁺) are shown. Numbers indicate the percentages of lymphocytes in the gates.

LTα–LTβR interaction is suggested to affect the local concentration of adhesion molecules such as MadCAM-1 and homeostatic chemokines [38,42], the cellular and molecular mechanisms, by which defects in LTβR and/or NIK-signaling in gut stromal cells selectively affects B cell recruitment, still remain to be elucidated.

However, unlike naïve BM B cells, migration of gut-activated B cells appears to be independent of gut stromal cells with a functional NIK. This is supported by the observation that IgM⁺ B cells from PP or naïve BM B cells that had been allowed to experience a normal gut environment (after short term parabiosis of BM reconstituted *aly* with RAG-2⁻/⁻ mice) can migrate to LP of *aly/aly* mice [53] (Fig. 1).

Together, these observations imply that naïve and gut-activated B cells have different requirements for migration to the gut and strongly suggest that normal gut environment imprints B cells with gut-seeking properties [53]. Interestingly, mucosal but not systemic DCs, were reported to enhance integrin α4β7 and CCR9 expression on activated CD4 and CD8 T cells, through secretion of retinoic acid, thus imprinting T cells with gut homing properties [55–57]. Whether retinoic acid produced by gut DCs has a similar effect on activated B cells, or whether other cell populations through retinoic acid or other factors imprint activated B or T cells with gut homing properties, remain to be elucidated in future studies.

6. Migration of peritoneal B1 cells to the gut LP

Another source of B cells that contributes to intestinal IgA plasma cells is the peritoneal cavity. Unlike the B1-cell derived natural IgMs, which are secreted even in germ-free mice, the production of intestinal IgAs requires the presence of commensal flora [40]. This indicates that the production of intestinal IgA is probably induced by antigenic stimulation. Indeed, germ-free mice accumulate significantly more numbers of B1 cells in the peritoneal cavity than mice kept under specific-pathogen free conditions harboring a diverse gut microbiota [79]. Together, these observations suggest that a significant fraction of B1 cells are sensing the gut bacteria and are constantly induced to migrate out of the peritoneal cavity. Intestinal lesions induced by acute gut inflammation or direct stimulation of peritoneal B1 cells by TLR ligands such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or peptidoglycan (PG), induce a significant egress of B1 cells from the peritoneum and their re-localization to effector tissues, such as gut LP. The molecular mechanism contributing to TLR-induced mobilization of B1 cells from the peritoneal cavity involves a coordinated down-regulation of integrins and tetraspanin CD9, and activation of G-protein coupled receptors. Together, these changes allow detachment of cells from the local matrix and a high velocity movement in response to chemokines [79]. Besides signals through TLR pathway, the chemotactic response of peritoneal B1 cells requires also a functional NIK, because peritoneal B1 cells from *aly/aly* mice, that have an intrinsic defect in response to lymphoid chemokines, failed to generate IgA plasma cells even after transfer into RAG2⁻/⁻ mice [38].

7. IgA switching and generation of IgA plasma cells in the gut LP

Thus, IgM⁺ B cells can be recruited into the gut LP through at least three pathways. In the first, and probably the major pathway, naïve BM-derived B cells initially migrate into the gut follicular structures (PP, ILF), where they are activated and imprinted with gut seeking properties, by up-regulation of gut homing receptors (integrin α4β7, CCR9). Similar to switched IgA⁺ B cells, the gut-experienced IgM⁺ B cells preferentially migrate to the LP, independent on LTβR/NIK signals on stromal cells. A second pathway depends on direct recruitment of naïve BM-derived B cells into the LP. This pathway requires an intact LTβR/NIK signaling in gut stromal cells, and involves most likely adhesion molecules other than integrin α4β7. The third pathway includes recruitment of primitive, innate-like B1 cells from the body cavities after recognition of bacteria or bacterial products through their innate immune receptors.

Although it is extremely difficult to estimate to what extent these pathways participate in recruitment of IgM⁺ B cells to LP in a normal gut, it is likely that IgA generated in GALT-deficient mice must be derived from the IgM⁺ B cells which were recruited in a TLR-dependent and NIK-dependent manner, switched in situ to IgA⁺ B cells and further differentiated into IgA plasma cells in the LP. Indeed, activated IgM⁺ B cells expressing large amounts of AID and α-germline transcripts, as well as IgA⁺ cells, can be detected in LP preparations of GALT-deficient mice, i.e. in LP of *aly/aly* after double reconstitution with BM and NIK-sufficient gut stromal cells [53]. Furthermore, stromal cells isolated from the gut LP appear to support preferential switching to IgA⁺ B cells and differentiation to IgA plasma cells of activated IgM⁺ B cells regardless of their provenience (PP or MLN or spleen), even in the absence of T cells [30]. IgA switch inducing activity of LP stromal cells is due to their capacity to produce and secrete large amounts of active TGF-β, because anti-TGF-β antibodies drastically decrease the efficiency of switching to IgA. Further differentiation of IgA⁺ B cells to plasma cells is supported by IL-6, IL-10 and probably other cytokines or chemokines produced by LP stromal cells [30]. Thus gut stromal cells are capable not only of supporting recruitment of IgM⁺ B cells but also to facilitate their local differentiation to IgA plasma cells.

8. Mechanisms for antigen-recognition and induction of IgA responses at mucosal sites

How are gut IgM⁺ B cells activated for IgA class switching and how do the immune cells in gut “sense” the intestinal bacteria?

Clearly, M cells that cover the organized follicular structures in gut (PP, ILF) are capable to bind, translocate and then transfer bacterial antigens to DCs located in subepithelial dome (SED) region [58]. Some of these activated DCs migrate out, in a CCR7-dependent manner, to mesenteric lymph nodes where, by mechanisms not completely understood, they are inducing antigen-specific IgA responses [59,60]. Other antigen-loaded DCs that remain within the gut follicular structures, present

Fig. 2. Possible pathways for the induction of IgA responses in gut. (a) Naïve IgM⁺ B cells migrate to PP or ILF, where they are activated through BCR or TLR, and in the presence of T cells, are induced to proliferate and initiate germinal centers (GC). GC are special microenvironments where activated B cells up-regulate AID, and undergo CSR and SHM with high efficiency. (b) Some BM-derived IgM+ B cells or peritoneal B1 cells migrate directly to the gut LP, where they are activated by antigens and CD40L expressing T cells like in (a) or alternatively by antigens presented by LP dendritic cells (DCs) or polyclonal stimuli. In the presence of cytokines secreted by LP T cells or soluble/membrane-bound BAFF and APRIL produced by DCs, activated B cells up-regulate AID. The factors that are secreted by LP stromal cells (SC), such as IL-6, IL-10 and TGF-β, favor not only preferential class switching to IgA (c) but also differentiation into IgA⁺ plasma cells (d).

antigens to local CD4 T cells and initiate GC, where B cells stimulated through their BCR and either co-stimulatory molecules or cytokines, proliferate, up-regulate AID, and then undergo CSR and SHM [61,62] (Fig. 2). Recent work by Rajewsky and his colleagues revealed unexpectedly that mucosal but not systemic B cells are driven into GCs independent of their BCR specificity, through interactions of their innate immune receptors with microbial antigens [63]. Thus, T-dependent antigen-specific B cell responses in gut require both T cell help and activation through TLR (Fig. 2).

The paradigm of PP/ILFs as the major, or sole, site in the intestine that is capable, through M cells, of binding, translocating and presenting bacterial antigens to B cells has been recently challenged by the finding, that dendritic cells (DCs) located in the small intestine LP can directly sample intestinal antigens [64,65].

The role of DCs in surveillance of the gut bacteria appears to require that the integrity of the epithelium remains intact. To do this, LP DCs express proteins such as occludin, claudin I and zonula occludens I, which are required to open and close the tight junctions between the epithelial cells, project dendrites into the lumen, in a CX3CL1/fractalkine-dependent manner and sample the gut antigens [64,65]. It has been proposed that LP DCs that interact with pathogenic bacteria might migrate out from the LP, whereas those that encountered commensals might remain in situ, where they can probably present antigens, and activate T cells and B cells located in the LP [64]. However, this has not yet been proven.

LP T cells have an activated phenotype, as indicated by a higher percentages of cells expressing IL-2R and MHC class II molecules, and by higher production of cytokines (such as IL-2, IL-4, IL-5), which are involved in the generation of IgA responses [32,66]. However, even in the absence of T cells, it is possible that local B cells are activated by antigen presentation by LP DCs or polyclonal stimulation by microbes captured by DCs. Activated B cells, might then switch and differentiate to IgA plasma cells under the influence of factors secreted by LP stromal cells (Fig. 2). Supporting this proposal, the interactions between LPS-stimulated B cells and LP stromal cells greatly enhanced in vitro switching to IgA and differentiation to

IgA⁺ plasma cells, independent of T cells or the CD40-signaling pathway [30]. Moreover, activated LP DCs might be sufficient to induce the switching of B cells to IgA through a pathway that involves the engagement of B lymphocyte stimulator protein (BLYS) receptors [67]. Upon stimulation with LPS, interferon-α (IFN-α) and IFN-γ, human DCs were found to up-regulate the TNF-family molecules BLYS and A proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), which would engage the transmembrane activator and CAML-interactor (TACI), B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) and B-cell activating factor receptor (BAFF-R) receptors on B cells [67]. In a TGF-β-sufficient environment, by as yet unknown mechanisms, these interactions can induce class switching to IgA, by enhancing the accessibility of the IgA locus and up-regulation of AID [68].

Thus, LPB cells activated either in a BLYS-independent manner by polyclonal stimulation, or after antigen presentation by BLYS-expressing DC, might switch preferentially to IgA under the influence of cytokines secreted by LP stromal cells, then undergo terminal differentiation into IgA⁺ plasma cells. Taken together, these observations indicate that the LP might be a site where T-dependent and T-independent IgA responses are generated.

### 9. Biological relevance of gut IgA for immune homeostasis

The almost exclusive predominance of IgA in the gut as well as the existence of multiple pathways for its generation, independent of T-cell help or follicular organization, makes pertinent the proposal that IgA is a constitutive Ig isotype in the gut that represents an evolutionarily primitive form of the adaptive immunity. Then, what has led to the evolution of such a system that generates almost under any conditions large amounts of IgA in the intestine? In other words, what is the physiological importance of IgA secretion in the gut?

Numerous studies in animal models and in humans have provided evidence that oral immunization confers protection against various mucosal pathogens [69]. Studies in mice unable to produce IgA (because of deletion of the Cα gene) or those in mice unable to assemble and transport polymeric Ig (because of the J-

chain gene deletion) have yielded conflicting results with regards to susceptibility to mucosal pathogens. However, these studies revealed an enhanced activation in PP B cells [70], impaired intestinal anti-toxin protection [71], susceptibility to Salmonella typhimurium [72], elevated levels of serum Igs that react with gut bacteria [73] or food antigens [74].

Our own studies on mice deficient for AID, which have a complete block of CSR and SHM, and thus are able to produce and secrete only non-mutated IgM in gut, clearly indicate that hypermutated mucosal IgAs are critical for regulation of bacterial composition in gut. The absence of IgA leads to an abnormal expansion of anaerobic bacteria in all segments of the small intestine [14,75]. Among the bacteria expanded, uncultured anaerobes originally designated as segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB), strongly adherent to the epithelium of the small intestine, are the dominant population (Fig. 3a). Significantly, reconstitution of AID$^{-/-}$ mice with normal IgA (by long term parabiosis with normal animals) leads to a retreat of SFB to the large intestine and a complete normalization of composition of microbiota in the small intestine [75]. A similar anaerobic expansion is observed in immuno-deficient mice, such as RAG-2$^{-/-}$ mice, raised under specific-pathogen free conditions. This anaerobic shift in RAG-2$^{-/-}$ small intestine persists after their reconstitution with BM from AID$^{-/-}$ mice but is abolished by transfer of BM from normal mice, in concomitance with normalization of IgA levels in intestinal secretions [75]. A delay in colonization of the small intestine with SFB and the retreat of SFB to the large intestine were also reported in mice neonates in relation with the presence of IgA, acquired by passive transfer or later, generated by IgA plasma cells in the LP [28,76].

The anaerobic shift of the gut microbiota has a profound effect on the immune system. Persistent activation by strongly adherent anaerobic bacteria causes an enhanced recruitment of IgM$^+$ B cells in the small intestine, as demonstrated in AID$^{-/-}$ mice, in which LP IgM$^+$ B cell number is increased by a factor of 10 as compared with wild-type littermates [14]. IgM$^+$ B cells accumulated in ILF anlagen, leading to organization and ultimately to hypertrophy of ILF (Fig. 3b) as well as induction and accumulation of GC B cells. The IgM B cell hyperplasia is however not restricted to the gut LP, as accumulation of IgM$^+$ B cells with a GC phenotype can be seen essentially in all lymphoid tissues [14]. This hyper-activated phenotype is also observed in patients with AID-deficiency or those with common variable immunodeficiency syndrome (CVID), which have enlarged GC in lymph nodes and develop nodular lymphoid hyperplasia of the small intestine [77,78] (Fig. 3b). In both, mice and humans, an antibiotic treatment that decreases the gut bacterial load, particularly anaerobes, results in loss of intestinal hyperplasia and a drastic reduction of mucosal and systemic GC B cells [14] (Fig. 3c). The same results are obtained after reconstitution of normal IgA levels in the intestine, which leads to normalization of gut microbiota, followed by disappearance of lymphoid hyperplasia [75]. These observations established the relevance of IgAs present in the gut, which are clearly important for regulation of the intestinal bacterial community, and maintenance of an appropriate “geographical” distribution of bacteria in intestinal segments.

### 10. Conclusive and perspective remarks

Taking together, the new advances in the mucosal immunity field, briefly presented in this review, would imply the following amendments to the classic concepts for mucosal IgA synthesis:

1. Intestinal IgA plasma cells are generated by multiple, intricate pathways in both organized structures (PP, ILF, MLN) and non-organized, diffuse gut tissues (LP).
2. IgA represent a constitutive Ig isotype in gut, and IgA B cell development is dependent on microbial colonization, but does not necessarily require T cell help and GC formation.
3. There is a preferential homing of not only IgA$^+$ but also IgM$^+$ gut-activated B cells to the LP. The gut-seeking properties of IgM$^+$ B cells are most likely acquired in organized follicular structures of the gut.
4. Naive IgM$^+$ B cells migration to LP and generation of IgA plasma cells require a LTβR/NIK-sufficient gut stromal compartment.
5. Peritoneal B1 cells that sense bacteria or bacterial products through their TLRs are recruited to the gut LP, where they generate IgA plasma cells.
6. Intestinal IgA, besides providing protection against mucosal pathogens, plays a key role in selection and maintenance of a spatially diversified gut bacterial community.

There is now strong evidence that regulation of microbial composition through IgA in gut is required for initiation and maintenance of the fitness of our immune system. The absence of IgA homeostatic control, result in deregulation of gut microbiota, which in turn causes hyper-activation of the whole immune system.

The challenges for understanding molecular foundations for the immune fitness, with multiple feedback and feed-forward controls involving both bacteria and immune cells are great. The rewards for tackling such a complex issue certainly should include new insights into genetic strategies that our immune system adapted during the last 250 million years of evolution, understanding of commensal tolerance and new approaches for the prevention and therapy of mucosal disorders involving the immune system.
