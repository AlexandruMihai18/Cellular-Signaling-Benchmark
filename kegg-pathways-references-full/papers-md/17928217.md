Chondroitin/dermatan sulfate in the central nervous system
Kazuyuki Sugahara¹ and Tadahisa Mikami²

In the central nervous system (CNS) chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans, as one of the major barrier-forming molecules, influence cell migration patterns and axon pathfinding. By contrast, chondroitin sulfate side chains often form hybrid chains with dermatan sulfate and serve as a neural stem cell marker and neurogenic/neuritogenic molecules involved in neural stem cell proliferation. Hybrid chondroitin/dermatan sulfate chains are also involved in formation of the neural network by capturing and presenting heparin-binding growth factors like basic fibroblast growth factor, pleiotrophin, and hepatocyte growth factor to stem cells or neuronal cells.

Research tools for structural glycobiology are emerging to perform a high-throughput screening of glycosaminoglycans for the binding to ligands, to decipher sulfation patterns of rare functional oligosaccharide sequences and to build structural models for the shape of such sulfated oligosaccharides.

Introduction

cDNAs encoding over 40 proteoglycan (PG) core proteins and most glycosyltransferases and sulfotransferases for the synthesis of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been cloned [1]. Analyses of the mutant cells or organisms and gene-targeting technology have revealed essential roles of PGs and GAGs in various biological processes including cytokinesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, tissue morphogenesis, organogenesis, infection, and wound repair [1–3,4*].

Heparan sulfate (HS)-PGs are essential for brain development as demonstrated by the analysis of the *EXT1* null brain lacking HS polymerase [5]. A wide variety of chondroitin sulfate (CS)-PGs exists in the developing and mature brain [6]. Some HS-PGs such as syndecan-1 exist as hybrid PGs bearing CS chains as well, while other proteins such as laminin, tenascin-R, neuroglycan C, and appican, some of which are not usually considered PGs, are occasionally modified with GAGs as ‘part-time PGs’. Many other proteins may also be functionally regulated by glycanation with GAG chains. Emerging evidence suggests that CS-PGs play roles as crucial environmental modulators in the central nervous system (CNS). In the development and regeneration of the CNS, they have apparently contradictory roles as major inhibitors of axonal pathfinding and regeneration [7**] and as neurogenic/neuritogenic molecules [3]. These functions may be associated with the precisely sulfated distinct structures embedded in the CS/dermatan sulfate (DS) chains and are exerted mainly through specific interactions with heparin-binding growth factors. Individual CS-PGs, isolated from the same tissue at the same developmental stage, have CS side chains with distinct structural features [8]. This review will focus on recent developments in the structural and functional research of the CS/DS side chains in the CNS from a glycobiological point of view.

CS-PG-deficient mice revealed specific functions of brain CS chains

A functional analysis of the developing brain of nanomelic chicks, which lack aggrecan and exhibit lethal chondrodystrophy, revealed a crucial role for the CS side chains in neuronal cell aggregation, presumably representing neurosphere formation, and in subsequent gliogenesis by specifying a subset of glia precursors [9]. Other CS-PGs in the lectican family cannot compensate for aggrecan’s function. The molecular mechanism appears to involve a unique undersulfated CS chains with “C” disaccharide of the CS-PGs recognized by a monoclonal antibody (mAb) S103L specific for the core protein. (For abbreviations of disaccharide units, see Figure 1). The mechanism may involve interactions with growth factors.

CS-PG protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type Z (PTPζ/RPTPβ) is expressed predominantly in the CNS and is expressed in neurons and astrocytes throughout development and adulthood. Although PTPζ-deficient mice showed no obvious anatomical abnormalities in the brain, they exhibited an age-dependent impairment of spatial learning and enhancement of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus due to aberrant activation of Rho-associated kinase [10]. A possible mechanism may involve the CS chain and pleiotrophin (PTN)/midkine (MK) signaling since PTPζ is one of the

Current Opinion in Structural Biology

The coding system for the typical disaccharide units found in CS and DS chains and their unsaturated derivatives generated by digestion with CSases. CS chains, characterized by GlcA-containing CS disaccharide units (left panel), are often found as CS/DS hybrid chains with IdoA-containing disaccharide units (middle panel). CS units are named traditionally and the corresponding DS units are indicated with 'i', which stands for IdoA. Their sugar residues can be substituted with sulfate groups at various positions as indicated by 'S'. 2S, 4S, and 6S represent the 2-O-sulfate group, 4-O-sulfate group, and 6-O-sulfate group, respectively. Note that the 'B' unit rich in CS-B (DS) conventionally represents IdoA(2S)α1-3GalNAc(4S) [3] but stands for GlcA(2S)β1-3GalNAc(4S) in this coding system [51]. Thus, more than 10 building units may be found in CS/DS hybrid chains and can generate numerous polymer sequences. The sequences constructed by these units can be as diverse as peptide sequences generated by a combination of 20 amino acid residues. A wide variety of CS oligosaccharides, which have indeed been isolated, are shown as examples in Supplementary Tables S1–S3. CSases depolymerize CS/DS polymers to produce unsaturated disaccharide ΔO–ΔE units (right panel) from the respective parent disaccharides on the same line in the left and middle panels (for example, ΔA from A and/or iA units). ΔHexA stands for Δ4,5 unsaturated hexuronic acid. The distribution of IdoA along CS/DS chains has not been rigorously investigated as compared with HS, which comprises the sulfated domains, the largely unmodified N-acetylated regions, and the transition zones [39]. However, a systematic fragmentation study of CS/DS chains from various tissues using CSases and hyaluronidase specific for GalNAc-GlcA and IdoA-GalNAc linkages have shown non-random and periodic distributions of CS and DS disaccharides [52]. In CS/DS hybrid chains from embryonic pig brain, IdoA appears to be scattered rather than clustered along the polymer chains since the chains are extensively digested with DS-specific chondroitinase B, giving rise to disaccharides to decasaccharides [25].

receptors for these ligands, which share 45% sequence identity.

Although no apparent aberration was observed in the mice deficient in other lectican CS-PGs, neurocan, or brevican, the maintenance of LTP was disrupted, and the treatment of hippocampal slices with chondroitinase ABC (CSase) led to a 50% reduction in LTP, supporting the functions of CS of these PGs in memory and learning [3].

**CS chains regulate axonal regeneration and plasticity in the CNS**

The neuronal circuitry is modifiable. The potential 'neuronal plasticity' of the brain declines during postnatal development, accompanied by the emergence of peri-neuronal nets (PNNs), which are specialized, reticular extracellular matrices (ECMs) encapsulating neuronal cell bodies and proximal dendrites. CS-PGs, versican, brevican, neurocan, aggrecan, and phosphacan, have been identified in PNN [7**,11**]. Enzymatic removal of CS chains from PNNs in the adult visual cortex permits reactivation of ocular dominance plasticity [12]. In adult rat cerebellum, structural plasticity of Purkinje axons is induced by the treatment [13]. Thus, the CS moieties of CS-PGs maintain synaptic stability and restrict plasticity in the mature CNS. Rat brain CS derived from PNN is relatively undersulfated [14], the functional significance of which remains to be clarified.

The limited capacity of the adult CNS for regeneration after injury is due to the formation of a glial scar around lesions, where CS-PGs are overproduced [7**]. Degradation of CS by the application of CSase promotes regeneration of dopaminergic neurons after axotomy of nigrostriatal tracts [15] and enhances axonal regeneration

and functional recovery after spinal cord injury in adult rats [16]. Several therapeutic strategies aiming to overcome the impediments to the regeneration process have been proposed [7**]. Most recently, an inhibitory role for CS chains in axonal growth after CNS injury has been confirmed in transgenic mice expressing CSase [17]. The production of CS chains with ‘C’ units and expression of $C6ST$ are selectively upregulated in the non-permissive glial cell subsets and the cortical stub lesion site of adult rat brain [18]. A significant increase in ‘E’ disaccharide in the injured brain has also been reported [19]. Thus, the barrier function of CS chains in axonal regeneration is attributable not only to their overexpression but also to their particular sulfation. Notably, semaphorin 5A is a bifunctional guidance cue, interacting with HS-PGs and CS-PGs of neuronal growth cones for attraction and inhibition, respectively, being converted from an attractive to an inhibitory guidance cue by CS-PGs [20]. Structural analysis of the CS chains, required for the interaction with semaphorin 5A, will give insights into the inhibitory mechanism. Protein kinase C is involved in the intracellular-signaling pathways for inhibition of axonal regeneration by CS-PGs [21], though the link between the kinase and CS is unclear.

### Brain CS is a biomarker and a modulator of neural stem cells

The unique CS/DS hybrid epitope recognized by mAb 473HD, which is expressed on phosphacan CS-PG, a soluble splice variant of PTP$\zeta$, is a biomarker of radial glia and is involved in the proliferation of neural stem/progenitor cells [22**]. Generation of neurospheres from neural stem cells is reduced by CSase treatment or perturbed by 473HD. The epitope also shows substantial overlap with the adult neural stem cell marker LewisX. Most of the CS/DS sulfotransferase genes are expressed in the embryonic germinal and adult subventricular zones of the mouse forebrain [Akita *et al.*, unpublished data] and thus maintained in cells residing in the neural stem cell niche throughout life. Disaccharide analysis after CSase digestion of CS from neurospheres and E13 mouse brain showed oversulfated disaccharides, $\Delta D$ and $\Delta E$ derived from ‘D/iD’ and ‘E/iE’, in addition to non-sulfated and monosulfated units. CS-PGs, phosphacan/PTP$\zeta$, neurocan, neuroglycan C, and NG2, have also been demonstrated in the ventricular zone of the telencephalon of embryonic rats and in the neurospheres formed by cells from the fetal telencephalon [23*]. Particular CS/DS structures characterized by ‘iA’, ‘D/iD’, and ‘E/iE’ units possess the potential to promote basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-mediated cell proliferation of embryonic rat neural stem/precursor cells [23*], consistent with findings that commercial CS-E, DS, and CS/DS isolated from embryonic mouse and pig brains, which contained ‘iA’ and/or ‘E/iE’ units, bound several growth factors including bFGF, PTN, and/or MK [24–26]. Thus, the profile of sulfation of

CS/DS chains is a crucial factor regulating the proliferation of neural stem cells in the CNS through interactions with growth factors.

#### Functions of CS/DS hybrid chains in the postnatal brain development

Immunostaining of sections of the developing mouse brain showed the developmentally regulated expression of epitopes of the mAbs including CS-56, MO-225, and 2H6 (Figure 2, upper panel). These mAbs, which recognize octasaccharide sequences containing an ‘A-D’ or ‘C-C’ tetrasaccharide (Table 1), also stained regions around Purkinje cells, suggesting the deposition of CS between Purkinje cell surfaces and the processes of Bergmann glia [27]. The mAb 473HD epitopes containing an ‘A-D’-containing or ‘D-A’-containing hexasaccharide or octasaccharide were also located in the cerebellum [28]. The mAb 2A12 specific to ‘iD’-containing unique DS-decasaccharides (Table 1) stained the hippocampus and cerebellum of a P7 mouse [29]. CSase treatment of the cultured cerebellar slices diminished the amount of PTN [27]. Thus, CS/DS chains and PTN are involved in the formation of the cerebellar neural network during postnatal brain development.

In situ hybridization for CS/DS sulfotransferases (Figure 2, lower panel A–D) showed the ubiquitous expression of $C4ST-1$ and $C4ST-2$ (Figure 3) in the postnatal mouse brain, which are involved in the synthesis of ‘A’ units, precursors for ‘B/iB’ and ‘E/iE’, and the restricted expression of $D4ST-1$ and $UST$ in the developing cerebellum, which synthesize ‘iA’ and ‘D/iD/B/iB’, respectively [30*]. Also, a chemical analysis of the disaccharides produced by in situ CSase digestion in a brain section revealed a dramatic increase in ‘iB’ in the cerebellum [30*].

In situ hybridization of GalNAc4S-6ST for the synthesis of ‘E/iE’, which are specifically recognized by a novel phage display antibody GD3G7 (Table 1), showed a widespread expression of the gene in the developing brain including the olfactory bulb, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum, and striatum, whereas the expression was confined to the cerebellum and olfactory bulb in P7 mice (Figure 2, lower panel E). The cerebellar expression switched from the external granular cell layer to internal granular cell layer, reflecting the migration and/or maturation of granular cells [31*]. The GalNAc4S-6ST message was also highly expressed in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus and olfactory bulb, where neurons are continuously replaced throughout life, and in the striatum (Figure 2, lower panel E–H). The gene expression profile provides insights into the possible involvement of the ‘E/iE’-containing CS/DS chains in neurogenesis and organization of the nigrostriatal system.

Immunohistochemical localization of CS/DS epitopes and spatiotemporal expression of sulfotransferases in the postnatal mouse brain.

Upper panel, sagittal brain sections from postnatal day (P) 7 (a, b, and c), P12 (d, e, and f), and P20 (g, h, and i) mice were immunostained with mAbs CS-56 (a, d, and g), 2H6 (b, e, and h), and MO-225 (c, f, and i) [53]. Notably, the respective staining patterns in the cerebral cortex (Cx) and cerebellum (Cb) dynamically changed during development. Lower panel, sagittal brain sections from P7 (a and e), P14 (b and f), P21 (c and g) and 7-week-old (7W) (d and h) mice were hybridized with ${}^{35}$S-labeled antisense cRNA probes for C4ST-1 (a–d) [30] and GalNAc4S-6ST (e–h) [31] and exposed to X-ray film. Both transcripts were observed in widespread regions of the developing brain including the olfactory bulb (Ob), Cx, hippocampus (Hi), striatum (St), and Cb. At P7, strong expression of GalNAc4S-6ST was observed in the external granular layer of the cerebellum (arrowhead in e). The cerebellar expression switched from the external granular layer to internal granular layer with development, probably reflecting the migration and/or maturation of granular cells. Scale bars, 5 mm.

and ‘E’-containing sequences, respectively (see below), along with $N$-syndecan and PTP$\zeta$ are crucial factors in the development of the nigrostriatal dopamine system and Parkinson’s disease [32].

Thus, CS/DS hybrid chains characterized by disulfated disaccharide units ‘B/iB’, ‘D/iD’, and ‘E/iE’ play crucial roles in neuronal cell migration and/or maturation during the brain’s development.

Brain CS/DS chains can be separated into functionally distinct subpopulations. The parent E-CS/DS chains were fractionated on a PTN-immobilized column into unbound, low-affinity fractions, and high-affinity fractions (E-CS/DS-U, E-CS/DS-L, and E-CS/DS-H, respectively), which were eluted with buffers containing 0.15, 0.4, and 1.0 M NaCl. Most (88%) of the parent E-CS/DS was fractionated as E-CS/DS-U, whereas E-CS/DS-L and E-CS/DS-H accounted for 10 and 2%, respectively. E-CS/DS-L and E-CS/DS-H, which were enriched with ‘D/iD’ and ‘E/iE’ units, and characterized by a higher proportion of ‘D/iD’ or ‘E/iE’, respectively, exhibited morphologically distinct neurite outgrowth-promoting activities in rodent hippocampal cell cultures [26]. PTN-binding and non-binding octasaccharide sequences, both of which were isolated using the PTN-immobilized column after partial enzymatic fragmentation of E-CS/DS-L, are shown in the lower panel. The octasaccharide sequences marked by asterisks were identified in E-CS/DS-L [38].

# Isolation of neuritogenic CS/DS hybrid polysaccharides and oligosaccharides

CS/DS hybrid chains isolated from embryonic pig brain (E-CS/DS) showed stronger neuritogenic activity than the CS/DS chains from adult pig brain toward cultured mouse hippocampal neurons [25]. Antibodies against PTN and its receptor anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) or hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) and its receptor cMet inhibited the neuritogenesis induced by the E-CS/DS chains, revealing the involvement of the PTN-signaling and HGF-signaling pathways in the neuritogenesis [26,33]. By contrast, anti-MK antibodies showed no inhibition being consistent with the undetectable expression of MK in this system [26], though MK also uses ALK as a receptor. It is known that PTN induces phosphorylation of both ALK and of the downstream effector molecules IRS-1, Shc, phospholipase C-γ, and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase [34]. The E-CS/DS chains were fractionated using a PTN-immobilized column into unbound, low-affinity and high-affinity fractions (Figure 4). The two bound fractions exhibited morphologically distinct neuritogenic activities (Figure 4). The activity of the low-affinity fraction was inhibited by anti-PTN antibody while that of the high-affinity fraction was not, suggesting a distinct mechanism for the two fractions and the involvement of another unidentified signaling molecule for the latter. Thus, E-CS/DS chains are a heterogeneous mixture of functionally distinct chains. The functional chains are probably derived from PTPγ and phosphacan [35]. Presumably CS/DS chains of phosphacan in the ECM present minute amounts of PTN and HGF to the CS/DS chains of the PTPγ on neuronal cells (Figure 5). PTN has been hypothesized to induce dimer-

The accumulating evidence reviewed here suggests that fine structures of the CS/DS hybrid chains in the CNS are dynamically regulated spatiotemporally, and *per se* serve as signaling molecules interacting with various growth factors in biological processes including stem cell proliferation, neurogenesis, gliogenesis, and neural network formation during the brain's development.

Rapidly emerging glycomic technologies [42] including GAG microarrays [28,43,44], mass spectrometry [45], and microsequencing [38**,46,47] will accelerate the identification of protein ligands and the functional sequences. However, the development of a high-throughput universal sequencing method is essential. Once functional

primary sequences become available, computer simulation ([48], Pothacharoen *et al.*, [54]) can construct models of molecular shape with the electrostatic potential surface to reveal the crucial structural elements for chemical synthesis, or the entity in the ‘overall organization of functional GAG domains’ [49]. Since exogenous CS chains can recruit minute amounts of endogenous growth factors [26,33], the application of GAG oligosaccharides or polysaccharides instead of growth factors [32,50] would be an alternative therapeutic strategy. The isolation of functionally distinct GAG oligosaccharides or polysaccharides from a mixture of polymers containing active and inhibitory domains may yield slow-acting yet safer sugar drugs in regenerative medicine, which have few side effects due to the lack of disadvantageous domain structures.
