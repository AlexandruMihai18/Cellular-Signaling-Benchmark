Recently, several groups made a nearly simultaneous discovery that autophagic degradation represents a previously unrecognized effector of innate and adaptive immunity. Despite the fact that hints to these phenomena hail back to earlier sporadic reports, autophagy has, until now, received attention primarily as a fundamental cellular homeostasis pathway, whereby cytoplasm portions get sequestered by the membrane for delivery to lysosomes. This process leads to the removal of damaged or surplus organelles and digests stable, long-lived macromolecules. Autophagy has been implicated previously in both health-promoting and disease-associated states, in cancer, neurodegeneration, myopathies, development and aging [1,9]. Recently published studies now suggest strongly that autophagy is an innate immunity effector against intracellular bacteria and viruses [10–13]. Furthermore, because autophagy has a strong impact on MHC II presentation [13–16], and can be induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) [12,17], this extends autophagy roles to adaptive immunity functions. There are several varieties of autophagy, with macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy being the focus of this review because of their direct implications in immunity.

### Introduction

Autophagy is a fundamental cellular homeostatic mechanism [1,2], whereby cells autodigest parts of their cytoplasm for removal or turnover. The process entails sequestration of discrete portions of the cytosol into a characteristic double membrane vacuole, termed the autophagosome. On completion of an autophagosome, the trapped cytoplasmic material is separated completely from the rest of the cytosol and is delivered to lysosomes for degradation (Figure 1). In its most basic form, autophagy simply digests long-lived cytosolic macromolecules, such as stable proteins, in a process of importance for support of cellular anabolic needs and viability under starvation conditions [3]. Autophagy thus has a housekeeping role by promoting protein turnover and by removing damaged or surplus organelles. Autophagy removes leaky mitochondria, thus protecting cells from unscheduled apoptosis, as well as excess peroxisomes once they are no longer needed. Other organelles are also removed by autophagy when they need downsizing, such as the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and, in extreme cases, autophagic membranes can even sequester a whole nucleus [4].

Although autophagy, in its basic form, is best considered as a cell survival mechanism, under certain conditions, excessive autophagy can cause non-apoptotic programmed cell death (PCD), a phenomenon that has earned legitimacy owing to recent elegant mechanistic studies [5–8]. Autophagy has been implicated in both health-promoting and disease-associated states, in cancer, neurodegeneration, myopathies, development and aging [1,9]. Recently published studies now suggest strongly that autophagy is an innate immunity effector against intracellular bacteria and viruses [10–13]. Furthermore, because autophagy has a strong impact on MHC II presentation [13–16], and can be induced by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) [12,17], this extends autophagy roles to adaptive immunity functions. There are several varieties of autophagy, with macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy being the focus of this review because of their direct implications in immunity.

#### Autophagy: a fundamental biological process

Autophagy is in principle a cytoplasmic homeostasis pathway [1,2,18–21]. It is helpful to think of it as a sentinel or quality control system, patrolling the cytoplasm and eliminating damaged organelles (e.g. leaky mitochondria) and promoting turnover of stable macromolecules (such as proteins with long half-lives). There are several classifications of autophagy, including macroautophagy, microautophagy and highly specialized forms of autophagy (e.g. pexophagy, i.e. autophagy of peroxisomes). These processes are distinct morphologically but, in principle, share biochemical and trafficking pathways and represent more or less bulk degradative processes. In addition to these types of autophagy, which are for the most part related [21], individual cytosolic proteins can be lysosomally degraded through direct import across the lysosomal membrane, in a process termed chaperone-mediated autophagy [9].

During the process of macroautophagy, a damaged organelle or portions of the cytosol become sequestered by a nascent autophagosomal isolation membrane (phagophore), which eventually fully envelopes the object destined for elimination. The phagophore that is formed initially (Figure 1) is enlarged by the addition of new membrane (elongation) and seals to form a specialized phagosome. Autophagosomes are distinguished from the conventional phagosomes by the presence of a double membrane delimiting the lumen, which in turn harbors trapped cytosolic content or intraluminal membranes originating from the digested organelles. The fusion between the autophagosome and lysosome, often referred

Figure 1. Steps and key factors in execution stages of autophagy. By convention, autophagy genes and factors are referred to as Atg; in Yeast there are 27 Atg proteins. Initiation (a) is a process during which the isolation membrane or phagophore begins to form. An intermediate step, elongation (b), is characterized by membrane bending and increase in size of the phagophore, which wraps around the cytosolic component(s), in this case a mitochondrion or other organelles (such as peroxisomes or ER), although it can be just the cytosol (for degradation of macromolecules, e.g. long-lived proteins). Maturation or flux (c) involves fusion with late endosomes [LEs; often in the form of multivesicular bodies (MVBs)] and lysosomes (Lys), making the process sensitive to PI3 inhibitors, such as 3MA (classical inhibitor of autophagy) and wortmannin. The key regulator controlling initiation step is the Ser/Thr kinase Tor (negative regulator transducing nutrition and growth factor signals). The type III PI3-K hVPS 34 (generating PIP3 [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] on endomembranes) is believed to be required for both initiation and flux (maturation). Lumenal acidification (pink) and lysosomal hydrolase (cathepsin) activity is required for the completion of degradation by the autophagic pathway. Atg1 and several other Atg factors initiate the process and are under the control of Tor. Atg9 is the only integral membrane protein in the system. Beclin (Atg6) is in a complex with hVPS 34 and regulates and/or induces autophagy (it is also a tumor suppressor and can interact with the inhibitor of apoptosis Bcl-2). Two protein-protein and protein-lipid conjugation systems: (i) Atg5-Atg12 and (ii) LC3-II [lipidated Atg8: the C-terminal Gly residue is modified covalently with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) which translocates this protein to a nascent autophagosomal membrane], are associated with, and control formation of, the phagophore and autophagosome. Atg5-Atg12 (further complexed with Atg16) is essential for autophagosome formation and is found on the outside of the double membrane autophagosome. LC3-II is found both inside and outside and remains trapped in the lumen of the completed autophagosome; that portion is degraded in the autolysosome, whereas the portion on the outside membrane is believed to be recycled. LC3 is the best marker of autophagy at present because it converts from its LC3-I non-lipidated form to the PE-conjugated form LC3-II, so it can be monitored by western blots (LC3-II has increased electrophoretic mobility) or by translocation from the cytosol to punctate structures (phagophores and autophagosomes).

to as autophagic flux or maturation, results in a truly degradative compartment, termed the autolysosome. Under starvation conditions (e.g. low concentration of exogenous amino acids), autophagy becomes the sole source of essential nutrients. However, excessive autophagy has been implicated in PCD [19,22], with apoptosis being referred to as PCD type I, and autophagy as PCD type II. Although autophagy is primarily a cell survival mechanism, it can substitute for apoptosis and vice versa [5–8,19].

Using yeast as a model organism, 27 proteins (Atg1–Atg27) have been identified [23] as being involved in autophagy. The process of autophagy is conserved from yeast to humans [23]. For example, yeast Atg8, required for the elongation of autophagic membranes (Figure 1), is matched by multiple isoforms of mammalian Atg8 (termed LC3CA, B and C), and its closely related factors GABARAP (GABA_A receptor-associated protein) and GATE16 (Golgi-associated ATPase enhancer of 16 kDa) [24]. The single yeast Atg9 (the only Atg that is an integral membrane protein) is matched by hAtg9L1 and L2 in mammalian cells [25]. Yeast Atg1, which initiates autophagy downstream of the Tor (target of rapamycin) signaling cascade (Figure 2), has two potential homologs in mammalian cells: human Ulk1 and Ulk2 and murine Unc51.1 and Unc51.2, with Ulk1 (Unc51) being the best ortholog candidate [26]. The type III phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3-K) vascular protein sorting 34 (VPS34) in yeast (or its hVPS34 equivalent in humans) is required for the production of PI3P, and is needed both for early (initiation)

and final stages of autophagy, including fusion with lysosomes (flux or maturation). The hVPS34 lipid kinase interacts with Beclin 1 (yeast Atg6), an autophagy-inducing tumor-suppressor gene [5,27,28], which controls hVPS34 activity in autophagic processes.

The progression of autophagy depends on two ubiquitin-like protein conjugation systems that work in concert in the elongation stage of autophagosome formation (Figure 1). Atg12 is conjugated initially to Atg7, transferred to Atg10 and then conjugated finally to Atg5. The Atg5-12 complex is further stabilized by Atg16 and localizes to the outer, cytofacial membrane of the phagophore. Parts of this conjugation system are shared with LC3, which undergoes conversion from unmodified LC3-I to its lipidated form, LC3-II. LC3 is activated initially by Atg7, transferred to Atg3 and then C-terminally conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn). The lipidated LC3-II localizes to both the inside and the outside of the phagophore membranes (Figure 1).

The ‘execution’ aspects of autophagy (initiation, elongation and flux or maturation) are controlled by upstream signal transduction systems. The core signaling pathway, with factors either inducing or inhibiting autophagy, is depicted in Figure 2 (activators, green; inhibitors, red). A classical physiological inducer of autophagy is starvation. Another signal is withdrawal of growth hormones, which normally authorize cells to take up nutrients [7]. A pharmacological induction of autophagy can be accomplished using rapamycin, which inhibits the Ser/Thr

Figure 2. Signaling pathways activating (green) and inhibiting (red) autophagy. Growth factors (e.g. insulin) and other signals (e.g. IL-13) activate type I phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, which generates PIP3 [PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] on plasma membrane that activates the PDK-Akt-PKB axis, which in turn inhibits TSC1 and TSC2 GTPase-activating proteins for the small GTPase Rheb. The net effect is that Rheb is more active (e.g. in its GTP bound form), which activates Tor (target of rapamycin) Ser/Thr protein kinase. When Tor is active, this inhibits autophagy by affecting the downstream Atg factors (Atg1 being proximal to Tor action). LC3 (mammalian Atg8) is necessary of autophagosome elongation. The type III PI3-K hVPS34 is necessary to generate PI3P, which is required for both initiation and maturation or flux phases of the autophagic pathway.

kinase Tor (target of rapamycin). Tor is a master switch for cellular responses to nutritional conditions and growth hormone signals and integrates both inputs (Figure 2). Depending on the activation state of Tor, autophagy is either induced or inhibited: activation of Tor represses autophagy, whereas inhibition of Tor promotes autophagy (Figure 2). When growth factors induce type I PI3-K (e.g. p85p110), the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5) trisphosphate [PIP3; PtdIns(3,4,5)P3] on the plasma membrane activates a cascade of events (Figure 2), ending in Tor activation, which inhibits autophagy. If growth factors are withheld, this brings about increased autophagy, even if there are plenty of nutrients. In yeast, activation downstream of Tor involves Atg1, which sets off the Atg ‘execution’ cascade. It is important to remember that, although type I PI3-K is inhibitory to autophagy, autophagocytosis depends on PI3P production on endomembranes, and thus absolutely requires the type III PI3-K hVPS34. hVPS34 is the target for the well known pharmacological inhibitor of autophagy, 3-methyl adenine (3MA) [29]. Note that 3MA (and another PI3-K inhibitor, wortmannin) inhibit both the upstream (type I) PI3-K and the downstream (type III) PI3-K, although the downstream kinase (hVPS34) dominates the net effect [30]. Thus, 3MA is used invariably to prove that a given process involves autophagy.

Chaperone-mediated autophagy [9] is another pathway of delivery of cytosolic proteins into the lysosomes (Figure 3). This process imports individual cytosolic proteins into the lysosome through a specific Lamp 2 isoform (Lamp2a), assisted by the Hsc70 heat-shock proteins (Figure 3). Chaperone-mediated autophagy differs fundamentally from the macroautophagy described earlier because it bypasses the entire autophagosomal sequestration stage and, instead, individual proteins are imported directly from the cytosol into the lysosomal lumen. The different steps of chaperone-mediated autophagy are described in Figure 3. Although macroautophagy and chaperone-mediated autophagy proceed along seemingly unrelated execution pathways, there is evidence that these processes are coordinated. For example, when cells are starved, macroautophagy does not continue indefinitely but ceases relatively quickly, lest cells autodigest. Under such conditions, chaperone-mediated autophagy continues with protein turnover thus supplying cells with amino acids for anabolic needs [9]. Conversely, when chaperone-mediated autophagy is inhibited, as seen with aberrant proteins that can jam the lysosomal import machinery, such as in the case of α-synuclein implicated in Parkinson’s disease, this might result in compensatory activation of macroautophagy [31].

Autophagy: an innate immune mechanism against intracellular pathogens

Appearing almost simultaneously, several articles have indicated a strong role for autophagy in innate [10,11] and adaptive [12,13] immunity (Table 1). It has become apparent that autophagy is a mechanism for the removal of intracellular bacteria and viruses, in keeping with cytoplasmic maintenance as a primary function of autophagy. This topic represents a novel quantum leap but harks back to several earlier studies that implicated autophagy in host-pathogen interactions [27,32,33]. Reports implicating autophagy in defense against intracellular pathogens have existed for some time, both in the fields of virology [33] and bacteriology [32,34]. A case in point is that a crucial autophagy protein [28], Beclin (Atg6), was first identified in a blind screen as a protective

genetics has lead to a recent identification of 27 Atg (autophagy) proteins [18,23,47]. This has facilitated recent investigations of autophagy in mammalian cells immensely, including the rigorous demonstrations of its role in innate [10–12] and adaptive immune defenses against pathogens [12,13]. Collectively, the past and recent studies on autophagy as a defense against pathogens [10,11,27,33,34], along with the recent fundamental studies [3,45,46], indicate strongly that the process of autophagy is an important, albeit previously overlooked, innate immune mechanism.

Autophagy: an endogenous pathway of MHC II antigen presentation

Autophagy is more than yet another innate defense mechanism. Macroautophagy and digestion of endogenously synthesized cytosolic proteins enables their processing for MHC II presentation [13–16], thus connecting autophagy with adaptive immunity (Table 2). Earlier studies [48,49] hinting at these processes have found validation in recent work using modern autophagy investigative tools [13–15]. These studies have demonstrated that autophagy promotes MHC II presentation of cytosolic proteins. Apart from macroautophagy, a second pathway of cytosolic protein delivery to degradative endosomal or lysosomal compartments for digestion by lysosomal enzymes, termed chaperone-mediated autophagy [31] (Figure 3), also has a role (Table 2). It has been shown recently [50] that chaperone-mediated autophagy operates in the endogenous pathway of cytoplasmic antigen presentation by MHC II. Significant expansion should be seen in the areas in which autophagy overlaps with adaptive immunity, in the broad context of self and foreign (microbial) antigen processing and presentation, with relevance for the immunology of cancer [51], tolerance, autoimmunity and transplant rejection [52], and possibly thymic selection [46], as well as protection against viral, bacterial and other pathogens [13].

factor against Sindbis virus-induced encephalitis [27]. It should be emphasized that, until recently, autophagy was, for the most part, considered to support the intracellular survival of certain pathogens [35–42]. Now it is known that autophagy is an evolutionarily conserved innate defense mechanism against invading pathogens in animals [10,12] and plants [22] alike.

So why has the recognition of the immune functions of autophagy made its debut only now? Many aspects of the basal autophagy machinery [3,43–46] are conserved in all eukaryotes, including yeast, in which the power of

Autophagy: an immunologically regulated process

IFN-γ induces autophagy in macrophages [12] and other cells [17,53]. This alone extends the role of autophagy beyond innate defense. IFN-γ is an anti-tuberculosis immune mediator and is the best correlate of immunity against tuberculosis [54]. The exact nature of the antimycobacterial action of IFN-γ has remained an unsolved puzzle because neither reactive oxygen nor reactive nitrogen intermediates can explain in full its potent antimycobacterial action [55]. Recently, it has been shown that IFN-γ effects occur at least in part through a novel small GTPase, LRG-47 [55]. LRG-47 is a member of the family of p47-resistance GTPases, which are among the most potent known protective factors against intracellular parasites, albeit with still undefined functions [56]. The p47 GTPases are inducible strongly in macrophages by IFN-γ. Within this group of cytoplasmic GTP-binding proteins, LRG-47 has been singled out as the only one that is active specifically against *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* [55]. Until recently, the mechanism of action of LRG-47 was not known [56], although its involvement in membrane trafficking pathways had been

implicated [55,56]. Recently published work [12] shows that LRG-47 participates in IFN-γ-dependent induction of autophagy and the overexpression of LRG-47 was sufficient to bring about certain aspects of IFN-γ-induced autophagy [12]. Understanding the mechanisms and exact details of autophagy or autophagy-assisted processes affected by IFN-γ and IFN-γ-inducible GTPases from the p47 family is an important area of future study. Of further interest in the context of IFN-γ and autophagy is an earlier study connecting IFN-γ and the Tor pathway [57], a signaling area that might require renewed attention. Another important aspect of IFN-γ action relates to the role of autophagy in antigen presentation. In addition to the effects of IFN-γ on autophagy, IFN-γ enhances MHC II expression [58,59]. We can thus postulate that IFN-γ, by inducing both autophagy and MHC II expression, might coordinate the autophagic aspect of MHC II antigen processing and presentation.

A look ahead and concluding remarks: autophagy and Th1 versus Th2 cytokines

Because IFN-γ induces or augments autophagy, a broader question can be posed regarding patterns of Th1 and Th2 cytokine effects in the context of autophagy as an immune effector. Studies of autophagy in immunity are still in their infancy, therefore there are no published studies on this topic and one can only speculate. Intriguingly, interleukin-13 (IL-13) happens to be a strong antagonist of autophagy because it stimulates type I PI3-K [60], which in turn activates the protein kinase B (PKB)-Tor cascade (Figure 2). Incidentally, IL-13 was used as a powerful autophagy inhibitor in the original papers that delineated the autophagy signaling pathways shown in Figure 2, before any relationship to infectious disease or immunity was considered [30,61]. Although nothing is known about IL-4 effects, it is of note that insulin receptor substrate phosphorylation (leading to type I PI3-K activation) on IL-13 stimulation also occurs after IL-4 stimulation, thus it will be of interest to find out whether and how IL-4 affects autophagy. Based on these considerations, we are intrigued by the idea that one of the effects of certain Th2 cytokines might be the suppression of autophagy. This is of course highly speculative but nevertheless worth testing. Regardless of how that turns out, other more firmly grounded aspects of autophagic pathways discussed in this review will provide new and exciting exploratory directions to evaluate autophagy as an innate immune mechanism, one of the terminal effectors of immune

activation and a process that affects the development of adaptive immunity.
