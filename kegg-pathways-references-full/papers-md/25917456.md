**A B S T R A C T**

Haploinsufficiency of the Gata3 gene, which encodes a zinc-finger transcription factor, is associated with the disorder hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome in humans. However, the roles of Gata3 in transcriptional regulation in the parathyroid glands are not well-understood. In this study, we show that Gata3 activates transcription of parathyroid hormone (PTH), which is secreted from parathyroid glands and is critical for regulating serum calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Gata3 interacted with Gcm2 and MafB, two known transcriptional regulators of parathyroid development, and synergistically stimulated the PTH promoter. An SP1-binding element (GC box) located within the PTH-promoter proximal region was critical for activating transcription by Gata3. In addition, the ubiquitous transcription factor SP1 also interacted with Gata3 as well as MafB and Gcm2, and HDR syndrome-associated Gata3 mutants were defective in activating the PTH promoter. These results suggest that Gata3 is a critical regulator of PTH gene expression.

### 1. Introduction

Parathyroid glands play pivotal roles in the regulation of extracellular calcium and phosphate homeostasis by secreting parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH increases the serum calcium concentration by directly inducing calcium release from bone and calcium reabsorption in the kidney. In addition, it stimulates 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D₃ (1,25(OH)₂D₃) synthesis in the kidney, thereby enhancing intestinal calcium absorption. PTH also decreases phosphate reabsorption in the kidney, whereas 1,25(OH)₂D₃ promotes intestinal phosphate absorption.

Parathyroid glands develop from the endodermal pharyngeal pouches: from the third and the fourth pouches in humans, and from the third pouch in mice. Studies in mice revealed that a transcriptional network involving Hoxa3 ([Kameda et al., 2004](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018); [Manley and Capecchi, 1995, 1998](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)), Pax1/Pax9 ([Peters et al., 1998](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018); [Su et al., 2001; Wallin et al., 1996](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)), Eya1 ([Xu et al., 2002](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)), Tbx1 ([Garg et al., 2001; Jerome and Papaioannou, 2001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)), Sox3 ([Bowl et al., 2005](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)), and Six1/Six4 ([Ruf et al., 2004; Zou et al., 2006](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)) regulates pouch patterning and formation of the parathyroid/thymus common primordium. In the primordium, the presumptive parathyroid domain is then specified by expression of the transcription factor Gcm2 ([Gordon et al., 2001](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)). Loss of the gcm2 gene in mice results in parathyroid primordial cell death and parathyroid agenesis ([Günther et al., 2000; Liu et al., 2007, 2010](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)). In humans, hypomorphic and dominant-negative mutations in GCM2 lead to a decrease in PTH secretion resulting in hypoparathyroidism ([Baumber et al., 2005; Bowl et al., 2010; Canaff et al., 2009; Ding et al., 2001; Doyle et al., 2012; Mannstadt et al., 2008; Mirczuk et al., 2010; Mitsui et al., 2014; Thomée et al., 2005; Tomar et al., 2010; Yi et al., 2012](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)). Recently, we showed that the later steps of parathyroid development are regulated by the transcription factor MafB ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)). Disruption of the mafB gene in mice results in impaired PTH expression and secretion. MafB is also required for the separation of parathyroid from thymus primordium and migration toward its adult location beside the thyroid gland. Both Gcm2 and MafB bind to their respective binding sites located in the distal enhancer region ECR4 (evolutionarily conserved region 4; see Fig. 1A) of the PTH gene and synergistically stimulate transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation assays also showed that Gcm2 and MafB physically interact when overexpressed: however, the mechanisms that mediate parathyroid-specific expression of the PTH gene are not fully understood.

Gata3 is a dual zinc-finger transcription factors that binds to the consensus DNA sequence (A/T)GATA(A/G) through the C-terminal zinc finger ([Ko and Engel, 1993; Merika and Orkin, 1993](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2015.04.018)). The

Locations of the binding sites for MafB (MARE: Maf-recognition element) and Gcm2 (Gcm-BS: Gcm2-binding sequence) are also indicated. (B) The luciferase reporter plasmids (0.05 μg) indicated in (A) were transfected into BHK21 cells with the indicated combinations of Gata3, Gcm2, or HA-tagged MafB expression plasmids (total: 0.6 μg; 0.2 μg of each plasmid) and pEF-Rluc (0.05 μg). Data are expressed relative to the activity in cells that received empty expression vector and pGL4/PTH-p (-5341) (left) or pGL4/PTH-ECR4+1 (right), respectively.

N-terminal zinc-finger contributes to the stabilization of DNA binding and also interacts with the multi-type zinc-finger cofactors, FOG1 and FOG2 ([Fox et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8)). Gata3 is a regulator of development of multiple tissues including the parathyroid ([Grigorieva et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.03.016)), inner ear ([Van Der Wees et al., 2004](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2004.03.026)), and kidney ([Grote et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.02.030)) as well as the Th2 subset of helper T-cells ([Ting et al., 1996](https://doi.org/10.1038/380632a0); [Zheng and Flavell, 1997](https://doi.org/10.1038/380632a0)), the sympathetic nervous system ([Lim et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8); [van Doorninck et al., 1999](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8)), epidermal keratinocytes ([de Guzman Strong et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.02.030)), the inner root sheath of the hair ([Kaufman et al., 2003](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2003.03.016)), and the mammary glands ([Asselin-Labat et al., 2007](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2007.03.016); [Kouros-Mehr et al., 2006](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2006.02.030)). Gata3 haploinsufficiency in humans is associated with the disorder known as hypoparathyroidism, deafness, and renal dysplasia (HDR) syndrome ([Van Esch et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8)). Gata3-disrupted mouse embryos die by E12.5 and exhibit renal abnormalities ([Lim et al., 2000](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8); [Pandolfi et al., 1995](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8)). In gata3−/− embryos, the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches exhibit gross developmental defects, and parathyroid/thymus common primordia are lacking ([Grigorieva et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.03.016)). Because Gata3 directly regulates gcm2 expression, expression of gcm2 is lost in the pouches of gata3−/− embryos. Gata3+/− mice are viable and have apparently normal parathyroid glands ([Grigorieva et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.03.016)). However, when fed a low calcium/vitamin D diet, plasma PTH levels and calcium concentrations are lower than those in wild-type mice, indicating partial parathyroid dysfunction in the gata3+/− mice ([Grigorieva et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.03.016)).

In this study, we examined whether Gata3 plays a direct role in PTH gene transcription. We found that Gata3, in cooperation with Gcm2 and MafB, stimulates PTH gene expression. Gata3 activated the PTH promoter through the promoter-proximal GC box, but not canonical GATA element, and interacted with the GC box-binding transcription factor SP1. In addition, HDR syndrome-associated Gata3 mutants were defective in PTH gene transactivation.

2. Materials and methods

2.1. Plasmids

To construct the luciferase reporter plasmid pGL4/PTH-p (-5341), a BamHI-BglII fragment (spanning ECR4 to the first exon of the human PTH gene; −5341 to +66) of the pPTHg108 plasmid (a gift from Dr. H. M. Kronenberg) ([Vasicek et al., 1983](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8)) was inserted into the BglII site of the pGL4.10 plasmid (Promega, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA) ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.016)). To construct the pGL4/PTH-p (-3879) plasmid, a DNA fragment spanning the FspI site (located between ECR3 and ECR4) and the KpnI site (located at the multi-cloning site) of the GL4/PTH-p (-5341) plasmid was deleted by restriction enzyme digestion and blunt-end self-ligation. A series of other reporter plasmids was constructed by PCR amplification of DNA fragments and cloned into the pGL4.10 plasmid. Substitution mutations were introduced by site-directed overhang extension PCR mutagenesis.

The expression plasmids for HA-tagged human MafB (pHygEF2/HA-h-mafB), mouse Gcm2 (pHygEF2/gcm2) and Renilla luciferase (pEF-Rluc) were described previously ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.016); [Kanai et al., 2010](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2010.03.016); [Kataoka et al., 2001](https://doi.org/10.1016/S0092-8674(00)80368-8)). To construct an expression plasmid for mouse Gata3 (pHygEF2/gata3), the entire open-reading frame of mouse Gata3 was amplified by RT-PCR (5′-cttctagaATGGAGGTGACTGCGGACCAG-3′ and 5′-CTCTCTAA CCCATGGCGGTTGACCATGCTGG-3′) and cloned into the pCRII-TOPO vector. From the resultant plasmid, an Xbal-NotI fragment was excised and inserted into the XbaI-NotI sites of the pHygEF2 plasmid. Substitution mutants of Gata3 were constructed by site-directed overhang extension PCR mutagenesis.

The expression plasmid for FLAG-tagged mouse Gcm2 (pHygEF2/FLAG-gcm2) was described previously ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ydbio.2011.03.016)).

or MafB. As we reported previously ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.03.014)), expression of Gcm2 or MafB alone resulted in no or little activation of the reporter containing ECR1 through ECR4 (pGL4/PTH-p (-5341); [Fig. 1A and B](#fig1)), respectively, but when expressed together, they synergistically activated the reporter ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lanes 1, 3, 4, and 7). Expression of Gata3 alone also activated the reporter ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lane 2), and while co-expression of Gata3 plus Gcm2 or MafB did not enhance the activity induced by Gata3 alone ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lanes 5 and 6), co-expression of these three factors resulted in synergistic stimulation of reporter activity ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lane 8).

To determine the regions of the PTH promoter responsible for activation by Gata3, a series of reporter plasmids containing different regions of the promoter was constructed ([Fig. 1A](#fig1)). The reporter construct containing ECR1 through ECR3, but lacking ECR4 (pGL4/PTH-p (-3879)), lost responsiveness to Gcm2 and MafB as reported previously ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.03.014)) ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lanes 9, 11, 12, and 15). By contrast, expression of Gata3 stimulated this reporter activity ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lane 10), indicating that ECR4 is dispensable for activation by Gata3. Interestingly, co-expression of Gcm2 and MafB with Gata3 had an inhibitory effect on activation of this reporter by Gata3 ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lanes 13, 14, and 16). The reporter plasmid harboring ECR4 and ECR1 (pGL4/PTH-ECR1 + 4) retained responsiveness to Gata3 and MafB when each was expressed alone ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lanes 17, 18, and 20), and was synergistically activated by combined expression of Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lane 24). Another reporter containing ECR1 alone (pGL4/PTH-ECR1) was activated by Gata3, but not stimulated by Gcm2 or MafB ([Fig. 1B](#fig1), lanes 25–32). These results indicate that ECR1, at least in part, mediates activation by Gata3, and ECR4 is required for Gcm2 and MafB to synergistically activate the PTH promoter with Gata3.

### 2.2. Luciferase assay

BHK21, a Syrian hamster fibroblast cell line, was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For luciferase assays, BHK21 cells grown in 24-well plates were transfected with 0.7 μg of plasmid DNA [0.05 μg of luciferase reporter plasmid, 0.05 μg of pEF-Rluc, and a total of 0.6 μg (0.2 μg each of Gata3, Gcm2, and HA-tagged MafB) of expression plasmid] using 2 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Cells were harvested 24 hours after transfection. Firefly and Renilla luciferase activities were measured using a dual luciferase assay system (Promega). Firefly luciferase activities were normalized on the basis of Renilla luciferase activities. Data represent the average and SEM of at least three independent experiments.

### 2.3. Immunoprecipitation and immunoblot analysis

A human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa was grown in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum. For immunoprecipitation assays, HeLa cells grown in 6-well plates were transfected with a total of 3.2 μg of plasmid using 8 μl of Lipofectamine 2000 reagent (Life Technologies). Whole cell extracts were prepared by cell lysis in 800 μl NETN buffer (150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 0.1% NP-40) containing a protease inhibitor cocktail (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan), sonicated for 20 s, and then centrifuged. Aliquots of the extracts were subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-HA agarose (Roche Applied Science, Indianapolis, IN, USA) or anti-FLAG agarose (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) and then examined by immunoblot analysis. The antibodies used were as follows: anti-HA (MBL, Nagoya, Japan), anti-FLAG (M2; Sigma), anti-Gata3 (sc-268; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc., Santa Cruz, CA, USA), anti-SP1 (sc-14027; Santa Cruz Biotechnology), and anti-Gcm2 (sc-79495; Santa Cruz Biotechnology).

## 3. Results

### 3.1. Gata3 synergistically activates PTH gene transcription with Gcm2 and MafB

To test whether Gata3 regulates PTH gene expression, luciferase reporter assays were performed using a human PTH-promoter construct spanning the evolutionarily conserved regions (ECRs) ECR1 through ECR4 ([Fig. 1A](#fig1)) ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.03.014)). Binding sites for Gcm2 (Gcm2-binding sequence; Gcm-BS) and MafB (Maf-recognition element; MARE) were identified within ECR4 in close proximity ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.03.014)): thus the effect of Gcm2 and MafB was also tested. These assays were performed in BHK21 cells because this cell line does not express endogenous Gata3, Gcm2,

We previously showed that Gcm2 and MafB physically interact ([Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mce.2011.03.014)). Therefore, we tested whether Gata3 interacts with Gcm2 and MafB. Gata3 was expressed with or without FLAG-tagged Gcm2 in cultured cells, and cell extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation assay using anti-FLAG antibody. We found that Gata3 protein co-precipitated with FLAG-Gcm2 ([Fig. 2A](#fig2)). Similarly, HA-tagged MafB protein co-precipitated with FLAG-tagged Gata3 when co-expressed ([Fig. 2B](#fig2)). These results indicate that Gata3 potentially interacts with Gcm2 and MafB when overexpressed. It is of note that slower migrating forms of Gata3 appeared when MafB was co-expressed (see also [Fig. 7C](#fig7)). These molecular species of Gata3 appear to be post-translationally modified forms, but the specific modifications have not yet been identified.

**Fig. 2.** Physical interaction of Gata3 with Gcm2 and MafB. HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Gata3 and FLAG-tagged Gcm2 (A) or FLAG-tagged Gata3 and HA-tagged MafB (B) as indicated. Cell extracts (input) were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG (α-FLAG I.P.) or anti-HA (α-HA I.P.) antibodies, respectively, followed by immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies.

Fig. 3. The canonical GATA element within ECR1 is indispensable for transactivation by Gata3. (A) BHK21 cells were co-transfected with a Gata3 expression vector (0.2 μg plus 0.4 μg of empty vector) or empty vector (0.6 μg) and the indicated reporter plasmid (left). Luciferase activities (right) are presented relative to that of pGL4/PTH-ECR1 and the empty expression vector. (B) A series of reporter constructs (shown schematically on the left) were transfected into BHK21 cells with or without the expression vector for Gata3. Data are expressed relative to the activity in cells that received empty expression vector and pGL4/PTH-Core (right).

### 3.3. Gata3 activates PTH gene through the promoter proximal GC box

Inspection of the nucleotide sequence of ECR1 revealed a conserved putative GATA-binding sequence approximately 170 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site (see Fig. 4A) (Kawahara et al., 2010). However, a luciferase reporter construct containing mutations at this element (pGL4/PTH-ECR1 mutGATA) was still stimulated by Gata3 expression (Fig. 3A, lanes 1–4). Another reporter plasmid containing only the proximal region of ECR1 (pGL4/PTH-Core) and lacking the putative GATA element was also activated by Gata3 (Fig. 3A, lanes 5 and 6). These results indicate that Gata3 acts through the promoter proximal region (Core; –161 to +52).

To determine the cis-acting element within the Core region that mediates transcriptional activation by Gata3, we constructed several reporter plasmids with truncated versions of pGL4/PTH-Core (Fig. 3B, left) and assessed them for activation by Gata3 (Fig. 3B, right). While the reporter construct with a 3′ deletion (del3′) retained responsiveness to Gata3 (Fig. 3B, lanes 1–4), Gata3 did not activate reporter plasmids lacking 30 bp (–131) or further regions of the 5′ end of the Core (Fig. 3B, lanes 5–12), indicating that Gata3 acts in the region between –161 and –131 of the PTH promoter.

Within this region, conserved and overlapping GC (CCGCC) and CCAAT boxes were annotated previously (Fig. 4A) (Alimov et al., 2003; Koszewski et al., 2004). We therefore mutated these elements alone or in combination and assessed them for activation by Gata3 (Fig. 4B). Mutation of the GC box, but not the CCAAT box, resulted in decreased stimulation by Gata3, indicating that the GC box is responsible for Gata3-mediated transcriptional activation.

To further confirm the role of the GC box, mutations were introduced into the GC box and putative GATA element, alone or in combination, in the context of the reporter plasmid containing entire ECR1 (pGL4/PTH-ECR1), and activation by Gata3 was measured (Fig. 4C). Again, mutation of the GC box greatly reduced Gata3-stimulated luciferase activity, whereas mutation of the putative GATA element did not affect activation by Gata3.

We next examined the role of the GC box, as well as the binding sites for Gcm2 and MafB, in the synergistic activation induced by Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB (Fig. 4D). A reporter plasmid containing ECR4 and the Core (pGL4/PTH-ECR4 + Core) was activated by MafB and Gata3 alone, and was synergistically stimulated by expression of Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB (Fig. 4D, lanes 1–8), restoring the responsiveness of the full-length PTH-promoter construct (pGL4/PTH-p (–5341)) to these factors. These results indicate that ECR4 and the Core are sufficient for the synergistic activity of Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB. Mutation of the GC box resulted in a marked reduction of activation by Gata3 (Fig. 4D, lanes 9 and 10), and synergistic activity was also reduced (Fig. 4D, lane 16). Mutation of the Gcm2-binding sequence (Gcm-BS) within ECR4 did not alter activation by Gata3 in combination with MafB (Fig. 4D, lane 22), but decreased further synergistic stimulation by Gcm2 (Fig. 4D, lane 24). Mutation of the MARE did not affect activation by Gata3 alone (Fig. 4D, lanes 25 and 26), but completely abrogated responsiveness to Gcm2 and MafB (Fig. 4D, lanes 27–32). Together, these results indicate that each responsive element for Gata3 (GC box), Gcm2 (Gcm-BS), and MafB (MARE) contributes to the synergistic activity of these transcription factors.

### 3.4. Physical interaction of Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB with SP1

To elucidate the mechanism of activation by Gata3 through the GC box, we performed a gel mobility shift assay using nuclear extract from Gata3-overexpressing HeLa cells and labeled oligonucleotides containing the GC box of the Core region. However, we did not observe any specific binding of Gata3 to this element (data not shown). Because the GC box is a binding site for the SP1 family of transcription factors, we then tested the interaction of Gata3 with SP1. An expression plasmid for SP1 was transfected into HeLa cells with or without the expression vector for FLAG-tagged Gata3, and cell extract was subjected to immunoprecipitation with anti-FLAG antibody. We found that SP1 protein co-precipitated with FLAG-Gata3.

(Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011). These genetic analyses, together with spatiotemporal expression patterns of Gata3, Gcm2 and MafB during parathyroid development (Gordon et al., 2001; Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2000), indicate that among these transcription factors, Gata3 is the most upstream, followed by Gcm2, and MafB is the most downstream. Here, we showed that Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB physically interact with each other and synergistically activate the PTH gene promoter. Therefore, we propose that Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB constitute a genetic cascade regulating parathyroid development as well as a transcriptional complex that mediates parathyroid-specific PTH expression. Furthermore, expression of Gata3, Gcm2, and MafB persists after parathyroid morphogenesis (Correa et al., 2002; Kamitani-Kawamoto et al., 2011; Lim et al., 2000; Ordóñez, 2013), suggesting that these transcription factors are components of a gene regulatory program that governs parathyroid-specific gene expression and function.

Our analysis revealed that Gata3 stimulates the PTH gene promoter through a GC box, but not a GATA sequence, located within the promoter-proximal region. We also showed that Gata3 associates with SP1. These findings are similar to a previous report demonstrating that in the sympathetic nervous system, Gata3 activates the dopamine β-hydroxylase gene promoter via the GC box and E-box by interacting with the ubiquitous transcription factors, SP1 and AP4, respectively (Hong et al., 2008). Therefore, we propose that Gata3 indirectly binds to the GC box within the PTH promoter region by binding to SP1. Interestingly, we found that Gcm2 and MafB also interact with SP1 when overexpressed. It has been demonstrated that long-range enhancer-promoter interaction by DNA-loop formation is a plausible mechanism of transcriptional activation by remote enhancer. Furthermore, SP1 has been repeatedly shown to mediate DNA-looping of various genes including SV40 early region (Su et al., 1991), interferon-β (Nolis et al., 2009), and heme oxygenase-1 (Deshane et al., 2010). Therefore, we propose that Gcm2 and MafB bound to the ECR4 distal enhancer region interact with Gata3 and SP1 bound to the promoter-proximal region, which may help to form a DNA-loop and facilitate PTH gene expression. Further analyses are required to elucidate precise mechanism of PTH gene regulation.

In HDR patients, many types of missense, nonsense, and frame shift mutations of Gata3 were identified (Chiu et al., 2006; Muroya et al., 2001; Nesbit et al., 2004; Van Esch et al., 2000). We selected three missense mutations of HDR-associated Gata3 (W275R, C318R and R353S) and evaluated their effect on activation of the PTH promoter, alone or in combination with Gcm2 and MafB, and potential to interact with SP1, Gcm2, and MafB. Gata3-W274R has a substitution within the first zinc finger and was reported to lack the ability to bind FOG2, a transcriptional cofactor of Gata3 (Muroya et al., 2001; Nesbit et al., 2004). We found that this mutant protein retained the ability to associate with SP1, Gcm2, and MafB, but is a weaker transactivator, alone or in combination with Gcm2 and MafB. This suggests that W274R protein can form a complex on the PTH promoter with SP1, Gcm2, and MafB, but cannot interact with its transcriptional co-activator, most presumably FOG2. C317R has a mutation in the DNA-binding second zinc finger and was reported to lack the ability to bind GATA-elements (Nesbit et al., 2004). Our analysis revealed that the GATA element in the PTH promoter region was not required for activation by Gata3, and that the C317R mutant retained the ability to bind SP1. However, this mutant completely lacked transactivating function when transfected alone or in combination with Gcm2 and MafB. This suggests that the C317R mutant binds to SP1 and inhibits DNA-binding ability of SP1. Alternatively, it is possible that the C317R mutant/SP1 complex can bind the GC box but is transcriptionally inert. We found that this mutant also lacked the ability to bind MafB, indicating that the second zinc finger of Gata3 is required for binding to MafB. The carboxyl-terminal tail mutant R352S was similar to the C317R mutant in that it retained the ability to bind SP1, but completely lacked transactivator function

The locations of mutations identified in human HDR patients (in parentheses) are indicated together with their equivalent positions in mouse Gata3. Two transactivating domains (TA1 and TA2) and two zinc fingers (Zn-finger 1 and 2) are highlighted. (B) Luciferase assays. BHK21 cells were transfected with the reporter plasmid pGL4/PTH-ECR4+Core and expression vector for the indicated Gata3 mutants, together with (right) or without (left) Gcm2 and MafB expression plasmids. Data are expressed relative to activity in cells that received pGL4/PTH-ECR4+Core and empty expression vector.

lost transactivation potential completely. When co-expressed with Gcm2 and MafB, the C317R mutant also failed to stimulate transactivation. The W274R and R352S mutants were less able to cooperate with Gcm2 and MafB than wild-type Gata3. These results indicate that these HDR-associated mutants are defective in transactivation of the PTH promoter.

To further characterize these mutant Gata3 proteins, we examined their ability to associate with SP1, Gcm2, and MafB. These Gata3 mutants were co-expressed with or without FLAG-tagged SP1, Gcm2, or MafB, and subjected to immunoprecipitation using anti-FLAG antibody (Fig. 7A–C). We found that the W274R mutant bound to SP1, Gcm2, and MafB at levels comparable to wild-type Gata3. The C317R mutant completely lacked the ability to bind MafB, but retained comparable or higher affinity for SP1 and Gcm2 than wild-type Gata3. The R352S mutant exhibited only marginal ability to bind MafB, but its affinity for SP1 and Gcm2 remained intact. The possible molecular mechanisms by which these mutations may influence transactivation will be discussed later.

4. Discussion

We demonstrated here that Gata3 activates PTH gene expression in cooperation with Gcm2 and MafB, and that HDR-associated mutant Gata3 proteins are defective in activating the PTH gene promoter. Previous studies using gene ablation in mice showed that expression of *gcm2* is lost in the developing pharyngeal pouches of *gata3*−/− embryos (Grigorieva et al., 2010), and that *mafB* expression is lost in the parathyroid primordium of *gcm2*−/− embryos

Fig. 7. Association of Gata3 mutants and SP1, Gcm2, and MafB. Immunoprecipitation assays. Expression plasmids for wild-type or the indicated HDR-associated mutant Gata3 were co-transfected with expression vectors for FLAG-tagged SP1 (A), Gcm2 (B), or MafB (C), and cell extracts were prepared (input). The lysates were then immunoprecipitated using anti-FLAG antibody (FLAG I.P.) and subjected to immunoblot analysis using the indicated antibodies.

when transfected alone, indicating that binding to SP1 is not sufficient for Gata3 to activate the PTH promoter through the GC box. On the other hand, the R352S mutant exhibited marginal activity when transfected with Gcm2 and MafB, probably due to its ability to bind MafB. These observations also suggest that both the second zinc finger and carboxyl-terminal tail are required for association with MafB. These analyses together revealed that these HDR-associated Gata3 mutants are defective in transactivation of the PTH promoter. More detailed analysis will be required to elucidate the precise molecular action of the HDR-associated Gata3 mutants.

Altogether, the results presented here demonstrate that Gata3, in association with Gcm2 and MafB, is an important component of transcriptional activation of the PTH gene. Further analyses will be required to elucidate the mechanisms of pathophysiological regulation of PTH expression, parathyroid function, and parathyroid development.
