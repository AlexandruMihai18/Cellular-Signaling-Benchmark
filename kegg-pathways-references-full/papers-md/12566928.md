## Abstract

Given the critical role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways in regulating cellular processes that are affected in Alzheimer's disease (AD), the importance of MAPKs in disease pathogenesis is being increasingly recognized. All MAPK pathways, i.e., the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 pathways, are activated in vulnerable neurons in patients with AD suggesting that MAPK pathways are involved in the pathophysiology and pathogenesis of AD. Here we review recent findings implicating the MAPK pathways in AD and discuss the relationship between these pathways and the prominent pathological processes, i.e., tau phosphorylation and amyloid-β deposition, as well as the functional association to amyloid β protein precursor. We suggest that regulation of these pathways may be a central facet to any potential treatment for the disease.

Components and Organization

MAPKs comprise a group of serine/threonine kinases that are activated through multiple protein kinases in response to extracellular stimuli by dual phosphorylation at conserved threonine and tyrosine residues [1]. The MAPK module is composed of at least three kinases that establish a sequential activation pathway. The top kinase of the three-kinase module is an MAPK kinase kinase (MKKK). The MKKKs are serine/threonine kinases that, when activated, phosphorylate the next kinase in the module, an MAPK kinase (MKK). The MKKs are kinases which recognize and phosphorylate a Thr-X-Tyr motif in the activation loop of MAPK; this defines MKK as dual-specificity kinases. MAPKs are the final kinases in the three-kinase module and phosphorylate substrates on serine and threonine residues. The vast majority of defined substrates of MAPKs are transcription factors. However, MAPK can also phosphorylate many other substrates including protein kinases, phospholipases and cytoskeleton-associated proteins such as τ protein [2].

Based on the sequence similarity, mechanisms of upstream regulation and, to a lesser extent, substrate specificity, MAPK pathways can be divided into several subgroups amongst which extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) 1 and 2, c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and p38 are the three best characterized [3].

The ERK Pathway in Neurons and Nervous System

ERK pathway, one of the three best-characterized MAPK pathways, is emerging as an important regulator of neuronal function since ERKs are abundant in adult brain and the ERK pathway can play multiple roles in the activity-dependent regulation of neuronal function [4, 5]. Therefore, ERKs may play a role in both brain physiology and pathology.

The archetypal ERK cascade involves the activation of the small G protein, Ras and the kinases Raf-1 (MKKK) and MAPK/ERK kinase (MEK) [4, 5]. The mechanism coupling the activation of receptor tyrosine protein kinase (RTPK) to the ERK cascade involves specific guanine nucleotide exchange factors and GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) [4, 5]. In fact, SOS, the specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor for Ras that can be recruited to membrane-associated complexes via the adaptor molecule Grb2, is an activator of the Ras-ERK cascade follow-

ing RTPK stimulation [6]. GAPs mediate the inhibition of Ras signaling. For example, SynGAP, a novel member of this family, shows CNS-restricted expression and is specifically localized within the postsynaptic density [7].

The activation of MAPKs requires the phosphorylation of a threonine and tyrosine located within the activation loop in the large lobe of its catalytic core and ERKs contain the sequence Thr-Glu-Tyr, which is distinct from other MAPKs. Many neurotrophins and growth factors, including NGF, BDNF, NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, bFGF and EGF, activate ERKs in neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes [5]. Membrane depolarization mediated by calcium influx through L-type voltage-sensitive calcium channels also activates the ERK cascade in cortical and hippocampal neurons [8]. Additionally, several neurotransmitters and neuropeptides activate ERK1/2 in neurons through stimulation of ligand-gated ion channels or G-protein-coupled receptors. For example, glutamate-mediated by NMDA and AMPA receptors activates ERKs in hippocampal and cortical neurons [9, 10].

At the cellular level, ERKs regulate a diverse array of functions including cell growth and proliferation, differentiation and survival or apoptosis. Regulation of cell proliferation is the best-studied function of ERK1/2 [3]. The other most explored function is regulation of gene expression, as evidenced by the fact that the majority of the substrates are transcription factors [3]. For example, the ERK1/2 phosphorylates Ets transcription factors such as Elk-1 and CREB that are involved in induction of fos genes, whose products heterodimerize with Jun protein to form the activation protein 1 complex [3]. Additionally, ERK1/2 can phosphorylate RSK90, which can, in turn, enter the nucleus and phosphorylate c-Fos [11]. Gene expression is necessary for the transformation of short-term events into long-term changes in synaptic strength. Therefore, it is no wonder that, in the brain, strong evidence suggests that ERKs are important components of activity-dependent signaling cascades within neurons and that modulation of their activity may be required for both synaptic plasticity and learning and memory [12]. Activity-dependent changes in neuronal function are predominantly mediated by elevation in intracellular calcium levels, a process in which the Ras-ERK cascade has been widely implicated as a major target for calcium signaling [13, 14]. Accumulating data have identified a prominent role for ERKs in long-term potentiation (LTP), the molecular mechanism that underlies learning and memory. LTP-inducing stimuli specifically increase the expression of ERK2 and B-Raf in the hippocampus, and ERKs are essential for hippocampal LTP induction [15, 16].

ional roles for ERKs in dentate gyrus LTP [17] and long-term depression [18] in cerebellar Purkinje neurons [19] and hippocampus [20] have also been described, which may reflect a requirement for ERK-dependent, CREB- or Elk-mediated, gene expression. Behavioral studies in rodents provide more compelling and direct evidence for an ERK-dependent role in learning and memory [21, 22] since behavioral performance is associated with increased ERK activity and inhibition of ERK signaling specifically impairs learning.

ERK is activated in a number of pathophysiologically relevant conditions. For example, ERK activation specifically occurs in the rat hippocampus after bicucullin-induced seizures and ischemia in an NMDA receptor-and calcium influx-dependent manner [23, 24], but the ERK activation may not interfere with postischemia cell death [25, 26]. ERK is also activated in rat hippocampal neurons after traumatic brain injury and inhibition of the ERK pathway results in a significant reduction of cell death and cortical lesion volumes [27, 28]. Additionally, ERK activation plays a direct mechanistic role in 6-OHDA toxicity, which may contribute to the dopaminergic neuronal cell death that occurs in Parkinson's disease [29].

### The JNK Pathway in Neurons and Nervous System

In neuronal and nonneuronal cells, potentially deleterious stimuli such as deprivation of trophic factors, UV irradiation, free radicals, hypoxia, ischemia, heat shock and cytokines provoke an intracellular stress response that either leads to apoptosis or defensive-protective adaptations [30]. JNK/SAPK and its downstream effector c-Jun are the major molecules involved in this bipartite response, which can accordingly lead to either neurodegeneration or neuroprotection depending on the cellular and environment conditions as well as cooperation with other signaling pathways [30].

JNKs are encoded by three different genes *jnk1*, *jnk2* and *jnk3*. The *jnk1* and *jnk2* genes are ubiquitously expressed while *jnk3* is selectively expressed in the brain, heart and testis. Due to alternate splicing, there are 10 different JNK isoforms which differ in their interaction and the catalytic alterations of their substrates [30]. JNK contains the sequence Thr-Pro-Tyr in the activation loop and its activation requires the phosphorylation of threonine and tyrosine. JKK1/MKK4 and JKK2/MKK7 are specific physiological activators of JNKs [31].

Jkk1 mRNA is ubiquitously expressed with particularly high levels in muscles and brain, especially in hippocampus [32]. Further upstream from the MKKs lie small G proteins such as Cdc42, Rac1 and MKKKs such as MLK3 and MEKK1 [33]. Activation of these upstream activators is both cell type- and stimuli-dependent.

JNKs phosphorylate a variety of nuclear proteins and regulate gene expression. Once phosphorylated, JNKs dissociate from the retaining anchor complex in the cytoplasm and translocate into the nucleus and associate with their nuclear substrates such as the transcription factors c-Jun, ATF-2 and Elk-1 [30]. Currently, JNKs are the only known kinases that phosphorylate serine 63 and 73 of transcription factor c-Jun in vivo leading to increased transcription activity [34]. JNKs can also phosphorylate a variety of cytoplasmic substrates including τ protein [35].

Although the expression and activity of JNK and JKK proteins under basal conditions [36] and the activation of JNKs by nonnoxious environmental stimuli [37] strongly argue for a physiological role of JNKs in the nervous system, little is known about the function and activation of JNKs under physiological conditions. Nonetheless, JNK appear to be involved in neuronal regeneration and neuroplasticity since JNKs are activated under regenerative conditions in the peripheral nervous system, by electroconvulsive seizures in an animal model for neuroplasticity and during treatment for depression [38]. Additionally, a neuroprotective role for the JNK pathway is suggested in motor neurons which are susceptible to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis [39]

By and large, the activation of JNK is linked to apoptosis. There is a great deal of evidence in support of a role for the JNK pathway in regulating cell death in neurons. For example, JNK is activated in PC12 cells upon NGF withdrawal [40] and, in a dopaminergic cell line, NM9D, 6-hydroxydopamine induces activation of JNK and apoptosis [41]. The apoptotic actions of JNKs in the adult brain were first demonstrated in JNK3 knockout mice whose hippocampal neurons were protected against excitotoxic death. JNK activation is implicated in the processes leading to neuronal death following nerve fiber lesions, ischemia and seizure [42]. Damage of dopaminergic neurons of substantia nigra compacta by axon transection in the adult rat brain results in strong activation of JNKs and consequent c-Jun phosphorylation; these events precede and parallel the nigral cell death [43]. JNK1 is activated in the cortex and hippocampus of rats that have been treated with kainic acid to induce seizures [44]. Further, CEP-1347, a specific inhibitor of the JNK

pathway, is neuroprotective in a number of in vivo models [45]. Therefore, taken together, these studies show that JNK is a potent effector of apoptosis and degeneration of neurons in vitro and in brain.

# The p38 Pathway in Neurons and Nervous System

Another major MAPK that responds to cellular and environmental stress is p38, which is also termed as SAPK2. The p38 pathway shares many similarities with other MAPK cascades and also has distinct characteristics in its components, regulation and biological functions.

There are four isoforms of p38 that have been identified: p38α, p38β, p38γ and p38δ, which derive from different genes [42]. A fifth isoform, nearly identical to p38β, has also been described and was named p38β-2 [46]. The p38α and p38β isoforms are ubiquitously expressed and have very high levels of expression in the brain [47]. The p38γ isoform is expressed exclusively in skeletal muscle [48], whereas p38δ is found only in lung and kidney [49]. It is thought that different isoforms have different functions, particularly with regard to their substrate specificity [49].

The p38 family is activated by dual phosphorylation on threonine 180 and tyrosine 182 within the Thr-Gly-Tyr site located in the activation loop. This phosphorylation is mediated by the dual-specificity kinases MKK3 and MKK6 [32]. The p38 signaling pathways upstream of MKK are further diversified, which may account for the activation by various stimuli. Several MKKKs have been reported to cause p38 activation including MTK1, MLK2, MLK3, DLK, ASK1 and TAK1 [42]. It seems that different MKKKs may function to mediate different upstream signals. For example, MTK1 mediates stress signals but not cytokines [50]. By cotransfection techniques, the Rho family member Rac or Cdc42 were also identified as upstream activators of the p38 pathway through the direct activation of MKKKs or via PAKs [33].

The p38 pathway can be activated by a variety of extracellular stimuli including growth factors such as GM-CSF, FGF, NGF, IGF, VEGF and PDGF, heat shock, cell stretching, proinflammatory cytokines and oxidative stress, which can lead to a variety of cellular responses including cell growth, cell cycle, cell death, cell differentiation and inflammation [42]. The role of p38 seems to be cell type- and stimuli-specific.

The relatively high basal level of p38 activity in neurons suggests that p38 may play important physiological roles in neurons such as a role in LTP [51]. Another important role of p38 involves neurodegeneration [42]. For example, the role of the p38 pathway in CNS has been explored in studies of ischemia and the mechanisms by which p38 modulates outcome may be attributed to their temporal/spatial and cellular distribution following ischemia [52]. Following bilateral common carotid occlusion with reperfusion in gerbils, p38 is increased as is mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MAPKAPK-2) activity over 4 days [53]. p38 has also been evaluated over several time points following permanent middle cerebral arterial occlusion and shows robust expression at 24 h in the peri-infarct region [54]. The timing of MAPK expression in this study suggests that p38 may be involved in the subsequent cell death that follows ischemia. Inhibition of p38 MAPK has been shown to be neuroprotective following permanent focal stroke in the rat [55].

## MAPKs and AD

AD is a terminal, dementing neurodegeneration that affects up to 15% of people over the age of 65 and nearly half of all individuals by the age of 85 [56]. It is characterized by selective primary neuronal loss in the hippocampal and cerebral cortices that correlates clinically with dementia. The most common and distinctive lesions present within the diseased brain are senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles (NFT). While there are a myriad of alterations in the diseased brain, the pathogenesis of these varied abnormalities is poorly understood. Nonetheless, many different hypotheses have been postulated including oxidative stress, cell cycle reentry and amyloid-β (Aβ) toxicity hypothesis. Given the important role that MAPKs play in oxidative stress signaling and cell cycle control, especially in neuronal survival and death in vitro and in brain, there is increasing interest in understanding the role that MAPKs may play in the pathogenesis of AD.

While total ERK1/2 levels are slightly decreased [57, 58] or little changed [59] between controls and AD, strong evidence demonstrated that active ERK is markedly increased in AD [59–61]. Activated ERK is found specifically in intracytoplasmic punctate structures and intracellular NFTs, mainly in a subpopulation of neurons exhibiting early τ deposition. Additionally, the upstream activators in the ERK pathway, including active Ras [61] and SOS/Grb2 [62], are also increased or altered in AD com-

pared to controls. These data suggest that the entire ERK pathway is abnormally activated in AD and a signal derived from the cell surface contributes to the pathogenesis of AD. Since the ERK pathway transduces signals that control cell cycle progression in response to mitogenic stimuli, it is interesting to note that growth factors such as NGF, TGF and bFGF, which can serve as a mitogenic signal from the cell surface, are increased in AD [63]. As a possible consequence of the activation of ERK pathway, a large number of cell cycle markers are reexpressed in susceptible neurons in AD [63, 64], suggesting an attempt of reentry of the cell cycle, which may contribute to the ultimate cell death. Additionally, as mentioned before, the ERK pathway is known to play a critical role in hippocampal synaptic plasticity and learning and memory and the proper activation and inactivation of ERKs are essential for hippocampal LTP induction [15]. Therefore, maintenance of a properly functioning ERK pathway is critical for normal hippocampal-related functions. The abnormally activated ERK pathway in the hippocampus in AD may therefore specifically disrupt or impair hippocampal function and contribute to the memory deficits in AD patients.

c-Jun, downstream of JNK, is also implicated in the pathogenesis of AD and colocalizes with DNA damage and is associated with neurofibrillary pathology [65]. That such c-Jun is physiologically important is apparent since c-Jun shows increased phosphorylation at Ser63/73 in association with degenerating neurons in AD [66]. JNK, as the only in vivo kinase that can phosphorylate and activate c-Jun, is also found to be increased and activated in nonfamilial and PS1-linked familial AD cases [67–69]. Notably we found that JNK2 and JNK3 were related to neurofibrillary pathology and JNK1 related to Hirano bodies in cases of AD but were only weakly diffuse in the cytoplasm in all neurons in control cases and in noninvolved neurons in diseased brain [69]. More importantly, JNK is not only activated but also redistributed, from nuclei to the cytoplasm, in a manner that correlates with the progression of the disease such that phospho-JNK is exclusively localized in association with neurofibrillary alterations in severe AD cases [69]. Additionally, we also found that Cdc42/Rac1, the upstream activator of the JNK pathway, is increased in AD [70]. Since the role of oxidative stress in AD is well documented and is one of the earliest events in disease pathogenesis [71], we suspect that the activation of the JNK pathway is a response to cellular stress including oxidative stress. This notion is supported by a recent finding that JNK is strongly activated in amyloid-β precursor protein (AβPP) transgenic

mice with extensive oxidative damage but not in AβPP transgenic mice with little oxidative damage [72, 73].

An increase in the p38 level and activity in AD brain tissues has also been described [60, 67, 74–76]. Immunocytochemical studies show that these increased and activated levels of p38 are associated with neurofibrillary pathology including NFTs and senile plaque neurites in the AD brain [60, 67, 74–76]. Further, the increase in and activation of MKK6, the immediate upstream activator of p38, provides compelling evidence that the p38 pathway is abnormally activated in AD [77]. Notably, the activation of MKK6-p38 is more prominent in susceptible neurons than in microglia, suggesting that this pathway may directly contribute to the degeneration of neurons in AD. The essentially identical staining pattern for phospho-JNK and phospho-p38 in severe AD cases suggests that JNK and p38 are activated by the same signal [60], a signal that, as described above, likely relates to oxidative stress.

A chronological and spatial study of the activation of ERK, JNK and p38 during the disease progression revealed a number of interesting results [60]. First, all three kinases are activated in the same susceptible neurons in mild and severe AD cases (Braak stages III–VI), suggesting that these kinases may play a synergistic role in the later stages of AD. However, of greater importance, the simultaneous activation of ERK and JNK in Braak I–II cases, which have a high tendency to develop AD, represents one of the earliest events in disease pathogenesis that likely precipitates further alterations [60]. Since both oxidative stress and aberrant mitotic signaling play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD and given that the activation of ERK is generally thought of as a response to mitotic signaling, whereas the activation of JNK and p38 is associated with a response to oxidative stress, this study sheds light on the chronological relation between these events. Indeed, the activation of ERK and JNK in control cases with limited pathology indicates that at least both events, aberrant mitotic signaling and oxidative stress, that lead to the activation of ERK and JNK, respectively, are required for the manifestation of cellular pathology of AD. These data also suggest that although both mitotic signaling and oxidative stress can exist as ‘single hit’, only after ‘two hits’ can the disease process be initiated [60]. Given that MAPK pathways are tightly regulated, the persistent activation of JNK and ERK throughout the disease process further indicates the chronic or ‘repeated hits’ that neurons in AD are subject to from both oxidative and mitotic sources.
MAPKs: In vivo τ Kinases?

NFT, major microscopic lesions associated with AD located primarily in the hippocampal and frontotemporal cortices, are localized primarily in the large pyramidal neurons [56]. There is marked correlation between NFT and neuronal loss and the progression of the disease [78]. Morphologically, NFT are classically described as consisting of numerous paired helical filaments (PHFs) [79]. The microtubule-associated protein τ, which is highly phosphorylated, is the major proteinaceous element of NFT [80] and using nanoelectrospray mass spectrometry (nanoES-MS), 25 phosphorylation sites were identified in PHF-τ [81]. Importantly, phosphorylation of τ protein increases the resistance of τ to proteolysis and phosphorylation is likely an early step in the formation of insoluble τ filaments and PHF [82]. Further, the phosphorylation of τ interferes with its ability to assemble microtubules which would likely compromise neuronal transport and consequently result in neuronal dysfunction [83]. Given that half of the phosphorylation sites in PHF-τ are on serines and threonines directly followed by prolines [81], it is conceivable that, as proline-directed kinases, ERK, JNK and p38 may play an important role in phosphorylating τ. In fact, there is considerable evidence suggesting that MAPKs may contribute to the hyperphosphorylation of τ protein in AD. Indeed, all three MAPKs are able to phosphorylate τ in vitro in a manner similar to PHF-τ observed in AD brain [84–88]. In fact, ERK2 phosphorylates τ protein in vitro to the highest stoichiometric level (14–16 mol of phosphoates/mol of τ) reported to date [89]. JNK and p38 also phosphorylate τ at many serine/threonine-proline and several nonproline sites as assessed by the generation of the epitopes of phosphorylation-dependent anti-τ antibodies and nanoES-MS [90]. Importantly, while two epitopes found in PHF-τ (those of monoclonal antibodies AT8 and AP422) can be phosphorylated by MAPKs, those epitopes cannot be phosphorylated by GSK3β, another major physiological τ kinase also termed as τ kinase 1. Therefore, MAPKs, additional to GSK3β, likely play an irreplaceable role in phosphorylating τ protein [90].

τ can also be phosphorylated by ERK in various cultured neuronal cells and the phosphorylation of τ compromises its functional ability to assemble microtubules [91–93]. Additionally, ERK can phosphorylate τ in a brain slice model [94]. Moreover, the specific inhibition of ERK activity prevents τ phosphorylation induced by fibrillar Aβ [95] (unpubl. results) and secreted AβPP [96]. These data indicate that ERK may mediate Aβ-induced τ phosphorylation in vivo. However, one group failed to find a correlation between ERK activation and τ phosphorylation in COS-7 and Swiss 3T3 cells [97, 98], which may be due to either the difference between neuronal cells and nonneuronal cells or the requirement of prior phosphorylation of τ by other kinases. To examine the exact role of ERK in vivo, Holzer et al. [99] generated transgenic mice with neuron-specific expression of activated Ras protein that is associated with an augmented activity of ERK. The chronic activation of the ERK cascade led to increased τ phosphorylation at multiple sites, which in turn stabilized τ protein and led to an increased τ protein level. τ protein was found to be translocalized from axons to somatodendritic compartments [99]. Although these findings suggest that active ERK is not sufficient to generate NFTs, this study provided convincing evidence supporting that τ is an in vivo substrate of ERK. This notion is further supported by a possible role for ERK in the Aβ-induced initial stage of τ phosphorylation and accumulation in AβPP (K670N/M671L) transgenic mice [100]. This evidence, along with the indirect evidence from immunocytochemical studies and fluorescence resonance energy transfer studies which demonstrate colocalization of active ERK and phospho-τ and the tight intermolecular association between active ERK and phospho-τ in AD and other tauopathies [59–61, 101], strongly suggests an important role of ERK in the phosphorylation of τ in AD.

Similar to ERK, p38 and, to a lesser extent, JNK can phosphorylate τ in transfected neuroblastoma cells and COS cells in response to osmotic stress [102, 103]. Additionally, in the brains of mice exposed to starvation-induced stress, JNK activation correlates with increased phospho-τ [104]. The in vivo role of JNK was also explored in vivo. While it appears that although JNK plays a role in the in vivo hyperphosphorylation of τ in a rat heat shock model [105], this action may require the prior phosphorylation of τ by other kinases such as GSK3β. Although abundant indirect studies show that JNK and p38 colocalize with phospho-τ and are in physical contact with phospho-τ in AD [60, 67, 69, 74–76], suggesting that JNK and p38 phosphorylate τ in AD and contribute to NFT formation, there is still controversy over the exact kinases that phosphorylate τ in AD. Nonetheless, given the above-mentioned evidence, it is highly likely that MAPKs play a key role.

MAPKs in Aβ Cytotoxicity

An overwhelming number of studies have demonstrated that Aβ is toxic to multiple neuronal cell types in culture. Since Aβ is toxic to cells, is the major component of senile plaques, and the Aβ burden is correlated with dementia, it is not surprising that many view Aβ as a key mediator in the pathogenesis of AD [106]. However, the mechanism by which Aβ leads to neuronal death is poorly understood. The studies on the role of the MAPK pathways shed some light on the understanding of this important question.

Studies from several groups consistently show that Aβ induces a 2- to 3-fold activation of JNK in different neuronal cell types and that this activation directly contributes to Aβ-induced cell death [107–110]. In the latter, the toxic effects of Aβ are suppressed by the specific JNK inhibitor, CEP-1347 [108, 110], or the expression of dominant negative upstream activator, SEK1 [107, 109]. In fact, the upstream activator MEKK1 and downstream effector c-Jun show high inducibility in response to Aβ [111] and c-Jun also plays an important role in Aβ-induced neuronal death [108–110, 112, 113]. The involvement of Fas ligand-Fas signaling, lying downstream of JNK-c-Jun pathway, was further proposed as being important [109]. Interestingly, JNK activation is localized to amyloid deposits within neurites containing phosphorylated τ in mice double transgenic for AβPP(K670N/M671L) and PS1(P264L) [114]. This not only suggests that JNK is activated by Aβ in neurons in vivo but also suggests that the activation of JNK may contribute to Aβ-induced hyperphosphorylation of τ in vivo. However, the mechanism by which Aβ activates JNK remains unclear. Indeed, given that not all Aβ-containing neurons show JNK activation, some additional factors might be involved in inducing JNK activation in vivo [68]. Interestingly, we found that JNK was activated in AβPP transgenic mice (K670N/M671L) which accumulate iron extensively, but not in YAC AβPP transgenic mice (K670N/M671L and V717I) which accumulate little iron [72]. Since Aβ is deposited in both mice, this finding suggests that iron may play an important role in mediating Aβ-induced JNK activation and, therefore, toxicity [73, 115].

Currently, there are some contradictory results concerning the effects of Aβ on the ERK pathway. Whether Aβ leads to ERK activation and whether ERK activation contributes to Aβ cytotoxicity are both under debate. Based on different answers to each question, there are four factions: (1) Aβ induces a sustained ERK activation and ERK activation contributes to Aβ-induced τ phosphorylation and neurite degeneration [95, 116] (unpubl. results); (2) Aβ induces ERK activation, but ERK activation has no effect or even some protective effect on Aβ-induced cell death [107]; (3) Aβ does not induce ERK activation, but ERK mediates multiple aspects of Aβ-induced neurotoxicity [117]; (4) Aβ does not activate ERK and ERK does not mediate Aβ-induced cytotoxicity at all [118]. It is also under debate whether Aβ has an effect on the downstream effector CREB, which is important in mediating LTP: one group reported that subtoxic level Aβ impairs CREB phosphorylation [119] while another suggested that CREB phosphorylation is increased by Aβ [120]. These contradictions are likely due to the relatively high basal level activity of ERK pathway in neuronal cultures and the relatively small effect that Aβ, probably in the presence of some additional factor(s) [116], has on the ERK pathway. To solve this problem may require applying different methods and different models with better controls. In fact, evidence in other models strongly suggests that Aβ leads to ERK activation. For example, in a brain slice model, Aβ activates ERK and CREB via hippocampal α7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptors even at concentrations typically found in CSF and brains of AD patients and in animal models of AD [121]. More importantly, ERK2 and CREB are significantly activated in AβPP transgenic mice (K670N/M671L) at 13 months, which provide evidence that increased Aβ levels can lead to ERK activation in vivo [121]. Additionally, a recent report confirmed the neuronal origin of the increased phospho-ERK1/2 in this model [122]. The aberrant activation of the ERK-CREB pathway in neurons by pathophysiological levels of Aβ may serve as a molecular basis for the disruptions in memory accompanying AD.

The in vitro effect of Aβ on p38 in neurons is also controversial with a debate on whether Aβ activates p38 in neurons: one group found that Aβ activates p38 in N2a neuroblastoma cells [123], while two other groups found no effect [107, 108]. The recent finding that p38 is activated in mice double transgenic for AβPP(K670N/M671L) and PS1(P264L) [114] as shown by immunoblot showed that Aβ activates p38 in vivo. However, due to the lack of concurrent immunocytochemistry data, it is not clear whether this is microglial or neuronal in origin.

MAPKs and AβPP

Familial, early-onset AD often shows a clear genetic inheritance linking to the mutations in one of the three genes, AβPP, PS1 or PS2 [56, 124]. Also, the location of the AβPP gene on chromosome 21 may provide a link between the pathology observed in individuals with Down syndrome (trisomy 21) and that seen in AD [124]. The AβPP is a ubiquitous transmembrane glycoprotein and the source of Aβ. The physiological role of AβPP and the mechanism(s) by which a mutated version of AβPP precipitates the onset of AD with very nearly 100% penetrance is unknown. Yet the processing of AβPP is firmly associated with the pathogenesis of AD since all FAD mutations lead to increased Aβ production [124].

Numerous studies showed that the ERK pathway plays an important role in AβPP processing and secretion [125, 126]. Although the catabolism of AβPP is constitutive, activation of signal transduction pathways such as the ERK pathway can alter the relative amounts of secreted AβPP and the level of Aβ produced. Activation of the ERK pathway, in response to a number of stimuli including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, testosterone and estrogen that are of benefit for AD, leads to an increased secreted form of AβPP production [127–130], which in turn further activates ERK [96], forming a positive feedback loop. Mechanistically, ERK may act to phosphorylate one or more targets that modify AβPP metabolism in a way in favor of the production of sAβPP [126]. Given that cells lacking PS1 show deficits in the coupling of AβPP processing and signal transduction [131], PS1 is a likely target of activated ERK. Since sAβPP is nonamyloidogenic, it is further suggested that ERK activation may be of benefit. However, the situation may be more complicated for the following reasons: (1) NGF and FGF, whose levels were elevated in AD [63, 64], increased the AβPP mRNA level via the activation of the Ras-ERK pathway in PC12 cells and it is suggested that overexpression of AβPP might be one of the mechanisms that directly contributes to the development of AD [132]. (2) The overexpression of AβPP and mutated AβPP activates ERK [133, 134] and AβPP potentiates the neurotrophic activity of NGF on PC12 cells via the activation of the ERK pathway [135], which might help postmitotic neuronal cells to reenter the cell cycle, an attempt that may lead to ultimate cell loss [63, 64]; it is relevant to note that AβPP plays an important role in cellular proliferation of colon carcinoma cells [136]. (3) As discussed earlier, Aβ may activate ERK and ERK activation contributes to Aβ-induced cell death. Interestingly, ApoE4, but not ApoE3,

is able to activate ERK and the downstream CREB pathway [136]. Further, the activated ERK-CREB pathway regulates the neuronal expression of PS1 [137]. Therefore, given the requirement of ERK activation for multiple functions of AD-related proteins and its critical role in learning and memory, the precise control of the ERK pathway is of extreme importance, and the decline of regulation on the ERK pathway during aging, as evidenced by the declined ERK activity, may render neuronal cells particularly vulnerable in the face of stresses. This decline in the regulation of ERK with age may account for the development of AD in almost half of the elderly over 85 [56].

JNK is also implicated in the modulation of AβPP metabolism since dishevelled-1 expression augments sAβPP production via the activation of the JNK pathway [138] and JNK3 induces robust phosphorylation of Thr668 within the carboxy-terminus of AβPP, the phosphorylation of which is believed to regulate the function and metabolism of AβPP [139]. Furthermore, the findings that JIP1, the JNK scaffolding protein, strongly binds to the cytoplasmic domain of AβPP [140–142] prompt the suggestion that JIP1b facilitates JNK accession to, and phosphorylation of, AβPP. This is supported by the finding that JNK associates with AβPP via JIP1b [140] and that the overexpression of JIP1b enhances the JNK-dependent threonine phosphorylation of AβPP [141]. However, a recent study suggests that JIP1b can directly modulate AβPP metabolism, independently of the JNK signaling cascade [143], implicating that JNK may play additional roles related to AβPP. Since AβPP is able to trigger intracellular signaling pathways [133, 144], AβPP may regulate the JNK pathway via JIP1b as a receptor [145]. Alternatively, the processing products of AβPP such as AID or AβPPCcas, which is released into the cytoplasm along with JIP1b, may serve as an activating signal of JNK and neuronal death [142]. However, the recent finding that the overexpression of PS1 in fact suppresses the JNK pathway seems contrary to the latter [146]. Therefore, the exact mechanism by which JNK modulates AβPP expression has still to be resolved.

Conclusions

There is now a wealth of evidence suggesting that the MAPK pathways play an important role in the pathogenesis of AD. Given the critical role of MAPKs in brain physiology and the multiple interactions between MAPKs and the key AD-related proteins, such as τ, AβPP, PS and

Neurosignals 2002;11:270–281

ApoE, the dysregulation of the MAPK pathways during the disease has pleiotropic and deleterious consequences. Indeed, due to the direct and intimate involvement of ERK in memory and learning, the improvement of regulation of the ERK pathway may be a central facet to any potential treatment for the disease. However, it seems that neither activation nor inhibition of the ERK family by therapeutic manipulation will achieve resolution without extensive side effects. A better understanding of ERK regulation during aging may be helpful. As to the JNK and p38 pathways, since they are more directly linked to downstream pathological effects such as hyperphosphorylation of τ and neuronal death, it seems that the inhibition of these pathways in AD brain will be of benefit. However, our poor understanding of the physiological role of these pathways may delay appropriate therapeutic regimens.
